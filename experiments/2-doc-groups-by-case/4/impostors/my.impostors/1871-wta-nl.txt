Sheridan, and Murray getting in ahead of me, in spite of all I could
do. No matter for that; Russia is a big country."
"That's so."
"A fellow could easily get lost in it, for none of us speak a word of
Russian, and most of us not much French or German," added De Forrest,
dropping his voice down to a whisper.
Beckwith looked at him, and tried to comprehend his meaning.
"Those fellows that ran away in Sweden, pretending they couldn't find
the ship, got off easy," added the purser.
"Not one of them has been punished, except Stockwell, who was only
deprived of his position as coxswain of the second cutter," replied
Beckwith, beginning to understand his friend. "All of them have been
allowed to go on shore with the rest."
"I should like to take just such an excursion on the same terms,"
continued De Forrest.
"But those fellows owned up, made a clean breast of it, and promised to
be good boys. The penalty hung over them for a week, and only their
good behavior saved them."
"Do you want to go down the Volga, Beck?"
"Of course I do. I would buy out any fellow's chance if I could."
"Perhaps we may go yet," replied De Forrest, with a wink.
"How?"
"Never mind it now. We are both in the first division, and shall go
to Moscow with the others. We will talk about it when we get there.
I expect to drop into the steerage next month, and I had as lief be
hanged for an old sheep as a lamb. Don't say anything."
"Of course not; but you don't mean to run away--do you?"
"Dry up!"
"Nobody is near us."
"I never was so disgusted with anything in my life as I am with this
election business. If I say anything, the fellows tell me it is a
chicken of my own hatching. Now, Cantwell pretends to be one of the
chaplain's lambs, affects a gentlemanly bearing, and studies seamanship
when all of us are on shore. Then he gave that Billy Bobstay a hundred
rubles, and the fellows all cheered him for it. I am so mad, I can
hardly hold in. I would rather be in a slave ship than here. I'm nobody
now."
De Forrest's schemes for his personal advancement had been utterly
defeated, and this fact was the key to his disgust. Though he had
been a wild boy on shore, he had done very well on board of the ship,
stimulated by the hope of promotion, and by the enjoyment of his
position in the cabin. His fall from the rank of lieutenant had a bad
effect upon him, for instead of working to recover his lost position,
he permitted evil thoughts to take possession of his mind, and chose to
regard himself as an abused individual. Like many men in public life,
he had frittered away whatever influence he had by laboring for self,
instead of the general good. The students of the Academy "saw through
him," and realized that he acted only from selfish considerations, just
as the sensible people penetrate the motives of the politicians. If he
was "nobody" now, it was clearly his own fault.
"What are you going to do, De Forrest?" asked Beckwith.
"We won't talk about it now, for there will be plenty of time to
consider that matter when we get to Moscow. Do you know who will have
charge of our party?"
"I heard some one mention the chaplain."
"Good!" exclaimed De Forrest. "He is not particularly sharp."
"But Dr. Winstock will go to Moscow with us, and accompany the Volga
party to Kazan."
"All right; he will leave us in a day or two," replied the purser, with
a significant smile, as though the arrangement just suited him. "How
much money have you, Beckwith?"
"I drew twenty pounds in St. Petersburg the other day, and I changed
my money in Stockholm into Russian paper. I have nearly two hundred
rubles."
"Is that all you have?"
"I thought that was a pretty big pile."
"I have a letter of credit for a hundred pounds, upon which I can draw
in any city of Europe," added the purser.
"Well, I can get more when I write for it."
"You had better write, then, for you haven't enough left to last you
three weeks."
"I don't know where we are going next," said Beckwith.
"The squadron is going to Hamburg, I believe, and from there on a long
cruise, which may use up five or six weeks."
"You mean up the Mediterranean."
"Yes; and if I were you, I would have a letter of credit sent to me at
Constantinople."
"Perhaps I will; but what's up, De Forrest?"
"Don't say a word now. All our chances for a soft thing are gone in
this ship, and if you want to enjoy yourself for the rest of the
season, keep your weather eye open, and follow my lead--that's all for
the present."
At ten o'clock in the forenoon, the first division of the tourists,
with the Volga party, embarked in the steamer for St. Petersburg. Each
of the students had his pea-jacket and small bag. Mr. Agneau, the
chaplain, was in charge of the division, and the surgeon, of the Volga
party. On their arrival they took omnibuses for the Moscow station.
Tickets for the party were procured, with places in the voiture au
lit, or sleeping car. The distance to Moscow is six hundred and four
versts, or four hundred miles. The fare is nineteen rubles, first
class, and thirteen rubles, second class. The time is twenty hours by
the express train, and four or five more by ordinary trains. Twenty
miles an hour is rather slow for a fast train, but it is about the
usual rate in Russia.
"That's it; this is a Yankee invention," said Scott, as Dr. Winstock
handed him his ticket, which was precisely like those of the patented
system used on most of the American railroads. "This looks like home.
It is stamped with the date, and I suppose they have the machine for
doing it. Here, doctor; the date is wrong."
"Wrong?" replied the surgeon, glancing at his ticket. "June 2; that's
