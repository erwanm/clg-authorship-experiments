beginning--that the rascal ought to be shot for presuming to think of
you in any other light than as the merest acquaintance. And he should
never have been that, had I been with you that unlucky summer.”
“We have been over that ground so often, Winston, that both of us should
be tolerably familiar with it,” rejoined Mabel, decidedly. “I prefer
that, instead of reviewing the circumstances of what you term my ‘early
fault,’ you should show me the evidence of your singular assertion
respecting Mr. Dorrance’s agency in a matter in which he could not at
that time have had the slightest personal interest. Or, shall I ask him?
It is an enigma to me.”
Without other answer than a contemptuous laugh, Winston left the room,
unnoticed by the musicians. But before she could form a conjecture as
to the meaning of his abrupt movement, he was back with a letter in his
hand.
“Documentary testimony!” he said, shortly, passing it to her. “I should
have forwarded it entire, instead of transcribing an extract, but for
Clara’s fear lest you should be led thereby to dislike her brother
before you had ever seen him. I take it there is no danger of
prejudicing you against him now!”
The letter was from Herbert Dorrance, and began thus:
“Mr. Aylett:
“Dear Sir,--Your favor of the 15th, enclosed in one from my sister,
reached me this morning.”
Then followed the expose of Frederic Chilton’s misdeeds, which Winston
had transferred to his own epistle to Mabel, as the leading argument in
his refusal to sanction her engagement.
Mabel read it through without flinching; then turned over to the first
page and put her finger upon a paragraph.
“Who was the lady here mentioned?”
Mr. Aylett shrugged his fine shoulders.
“I have never interested myself to inquire. Beyond the statement of your
friend’s rascality, the story was nothing to me.”
“Herbert!”
The ringing call--sharp and clear--checked the pianists in the middle of
a bar.
“Step here a moment, if you please!”
The novelty of the imperative tone and the glitter of his wife’s eyes
moved Mr. Dorrance to more prompt compliance than he would have adjudged
to be dignified and husbandly in the case of another man.
Mabel held out the letter at his approach, still pointing to the passage
she had asked her brother to explain.
“To whom does this refer? Who was the relative whose husband was a naval
officer?”
Herbert Dorrance’s constitutional phlegm was a valuable ally in the very
contracted quarters into which this question drove him, but his sister
was his deliverer. Affecting forgetfulness of the letter and its
contents, he glanced down one page, Mrs. Aylett leaning upon his arm,
and reading with him.
“I don’t think you need mind telling the name, here and at this late
day, Herbert,” she said, seriously and slowly, “provided Mabel will
never repeat the story when it can do harm. Have you never heard any of
us speak of poor Ellen Lester, my mother’s niece, who died several
years before your marriage?” accosting her sister-in-law, with a face so
devoid of aught resembling cowardly or guilty fears, that Mabel’s brain,
tried and shaken, tottered into disbelief at her own wild surmises.
“Not that I remember!”
“Is that so? Yet it might easily have been. She accompanied her husband
upon his last voyage, and the ship was never heard of again. Her
parents are dead, too, so there are few to cherish her memory. She was a
school-fellow of mine, and Herbert loved her as a sister.”
Mabel was gazing fixedly at her husband’s stolid countenance and averted
eyes, and made no rejoinder until the silent intensity of her regards
compelled him to look up. Reading distrust and alarm in these, he shook
off his sister’s warning hold.
“When you wish to catechise me upon family matters, Mabel, it is my wish
that you should do it in private,” he said, roughly. “Then you shall
learn all that it concerns you to know. There are subjects into which
only prurient curiosity cares to pry.”
“I beg your pardon!” answered Mabel, quietly. “I have but to say, in
self-defence, that I did not ask to see the letter.”
“It is a matter of profound indifference to me whether you did or not,”
 was the reply. “For aught that I know or cared, you may have read it a
year and a half ago. I retract nothing that is set down there. Clara,
shall we go on with our music?”
Glancing around stealthily at the finale of the (sic) he saw that
Mabel’s chair was vacant, and Mr. Aylett was reading composedly beneath
the lamp.
Clara made the same discovery at the same moment, and came forward
laughing to her husband.
“What had you been saying to our dear, excitable Mabel, that challenged
the introduction of that unfortunate document?”
“Told her of Frederic Chilton’s intended marriage!” curtly, and without
laying aside his volume.
“Preposterous!”
“I agree with you--but it is the truth.”
Herbert stood apart glowing at the fire.
“You must have approached the subject unskilfully,” urged the
peacemaker. “These old sores are oest left alone.”
“It is best for married woman to have none,” retorted Winston, doggedly.
“She does not persist in doubting his unworthiness, does she?” queried
the wife, aside, but not so cautiously that her brother did not hear
her.
He wheeled about suddenly.
“She SHALL believe it, or call me a liar to my face!” he uttered,
angrily. “I will put a stop to this sentimental folly!”
“You are late in beginning your reforms,” observed Mr. Aylett, dryly.
“You are a less sensible man than I give you credit for being, if you
ever begin!” interposed his sister.
“Leave Mabel to herself until she recovers from the shock--if it be
one--of this intelligence. The surest means of keeping alive a dying
