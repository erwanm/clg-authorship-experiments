IT was the end of September. Nearing a time of storms 
again in the air and on the sea ; but an absolute calm had 
settled clown upon Diana. Not at all the calm of death ; 
for after death, in this warfare, comes not only victory but 
new life. It was very strange, even to herself. She had 
ceased to think of Captain Knowlton ; if she thought of 
him it was with the recognition that his power over her was 
gone. She felt like a person delivered from helpless bondage. 
There was some lameness, there were some bruises yet from 
the fight gone by ; but Diana was every day recovering 
from these, and elasticity and warmth were coming back to 
the members that had been but lately rigid and cold. The 
sun shone again for her, and the sky was blue, and the arch 
of it grew every day loftier and brighter to her sense. At first 
coming to Clifton Diana had perceived the beauties and 
novelties of her new surroundings ; now she began to enjoy 
them. The salt air was delicious ; the light morning mist 
over the bay, as she saw it when she went to take her 
morning bath, held a whole day of sunlit promise within 
its mysterious folds ; the soft low hum of the distant city, 
which she could hear when the waves were still, made the 
solitude and the freshness and the purity of the island 
seem doubly rare and sweet. And her baby began to be 
now to Diana the most wonderful of delights ; more than 
ever it had been at any previous time. 



 

All this while she had had letters from Basil ; not very 
long letters, such as a man can write to a woman whose 
whole sympathy he knows he has ; but good letters, such 
as a man can write to a woman to whom his own heart and 
soul have given all they have. Not that he ever spoke of 
that fact or alluded to it. Basil was no maudlin, and no 
fool to ask for a gift which cannot be yielded by an effort of 
will ; and besides, he had never entirely lost hope ; so that, 
though things were dark enough for him certainly, he could 
write manly, strong, sensible letters, which in their very 
lack of all allusion to his own feelings spoke whole volumes 
to the woman who knew him and could interpret them. 
The thought of him grieved her ; it was getting to be now 
the only grief she had. Her own letters to him were brief 
and rare. Diana had a nervous fear of letting the Clifton 
postmark be seen on a letter of hers at home, knowing 
Avhat sort of play sometimes went on in the Pleasant Val- 
ley post office ; so she never sent a letter except when she 
had a chance to despatch it from New York. These epis. 
ties were very abstract ; they spoke of the baby, told of 
Mrs. Sutphen, gave details of things seen and experienced ; 
but of Diana's inner life, the fight and the victory, not a 
whit. She could not write about them to Basil ; for glad 
as he would be of what she could tell him, she could not 
say enough. In getting deliverance from a love it was 
wrong to indulge, in becoming able to forget Evan, she 
had not thereby come nearer to her husband or in the least 
fonder of thinking of him ; and so Diana shrank from the 
whole subject when she found herself with pen in hand and 
paper before her. 

When September was gone and October had begun its 
course, a letter came from Basil in which he desired to 
know about Diana's plans. There were no hindrances any 




longer in the way of her coming home, he told her. Diana 
had known that such a notification would come, must come, 
and yet it gave her an unwelcome start. Mrs. Sutphen had 
handed it to her as they came in from their morning dip 
in the salt water ; the coachman had brought it late last 
evening from the post office, she said. Diana had dressed 
before reading it ; and when she had read it, she sat down 
upon the threshold of her glass door to think and exam- 
ine herself. 

It was October, yet still and mild as June. Haze lay 
lingering about the horizon, softened the shore of Long 
Island, hid with a thick curtain the place of the busy city ; 
the roar of which Diana could plainly enough hear in the 
stillness, a strange, indistinct, mysterious, significant murmur of distant unrest. All before and around her was 
rest ; the flowing waters were too quiet to-day to suggest 
anything disquieting, only life, without which rest is nought. 
The air was inexpressibly sweet and fresh ; the young light 
of the day dancing as it were upon every cloud edge and 
sail edge, in jocund triumph beginning the work which the 
day would see done. Diana sat down and looked out into 
it all and tried to hold communion with herself. She was 
sorry to leave this place. Yes, why not ? She was sorry 
to exchange her present life for the old one. Quiet and 
solitary it had been, this life at Clifton, for Mrs. Sutphen 
scarcely made her feel less alone with her than without her ; 
and she had held herself back from society. Quiet and 
solitary, and lately healing ; and Pleasant Valley was full 
of painful memories and associations, her mother, and her 
husband. Diana felt as if she could have welcomed every- 
thing else, if only Basil had not been there. The sight of 
the lovely bay with its misty shores and its springing light 
hurt her at last, because she must leave it ; she sank her 



 

face in her hands and began to call herself to account. 
Duty was waiting before her ; was she not willing to take 
it up ? She had surrendered her will utterly to God in the 
matter of her love to Evan, and she had been delivered 
from the torture and the bondage of it ; quite delivered ; 
she could bear to live without Evan now, she could bear to 
live without thinking of him ; he would always be in a certain sense dear, but the spell of passion was broken for 
ever. That did not make her love her husband. No ; but 
would not the same strength that had freed her from temptation on the one hand, help her to go forward and do her 
duty on the other ? And in love and gratitude for the 
deliverance vouchsafed her, should she not do it ? 'I will 
do it, if I die ! ' was her inward conclusion. ' And I shall 
not die, but by the Lord's help I shall do it.' 

So she wrote to her husband that she was ready, and 
he came to fetch her. 

The Pleasant Valley maples were flaunting in orange 
and crimson when the home journey was made. The fairest 
month of the year was in the prime of its beauty ; the air 
had that wonderful clearness and calm which bids the 
spirit of the beholder be still and be glad, saying that there 
is peace and victory somewhere, and rest, when the harvest 
of life is gathered. Diana felt the speech, but thought 
nevertheless that for her peace and victory were a good 
way off. She believed they would come, when life was done ; 
the present thing was to live, and carry the burden and do 
the work. The great elms hung still green and sheltering 
over the lean-to door. The house was enlarged and im- 
proved ; and greatly beautified with a coat of paint. Diana 
saw it all ; and she saw the marvellous beauty of the mea- 
dows and their bordering hills ; she felt as if she were 
coming to her prison and place of hard labour. 




' How do you like the looks of things ? ' her husband 
asked. 

' Nice as can be.' 

'You like it?' 

' Very much. I am glad you did not make the house 
white.' 

' I remembered you said it ought to be brown.' 

' But would you have liked it white ? ' 

' I would have liked it no way but your way,' he said 
with a slight smile and look at her, which Diana could not 
answer, and which cut her sharply. She had noticed, she 
thought, that Basil was more sober than he used to be. 
She thought she knew why ; and she wanted to tell him part 
of what had gone on in her mind of late and how free she 
was of the feelings he supposed were troubling' her ; but a 
great shyness of the subject had seized Diana. She was 
afraid to broach it at all, lest going on from one thing to 
another Basil might ask a question she could not answer. 
She was very sorry for him, so much that she almost forgot 
to be sorry for herself, as she went into the house. 

Mrs. Flandin was sitting with Mrs. Starling in the lean
to kitchen. 

' So you made up your mind to come home,' was her 
mother's greeting. ' I almost wonder you did.' 

' If you knew how good the salt water was to me, you 
might wonder,' Diana answered cheerfully. 

' Well, I never could see what there was in salt water ! ' 
said Mrs. Flandin, ' that folks should be so crazy to go into 
it ! If I was drownin,' 'seems to me I'd rather have my 
mouth full o' sun'thin' sweet.' 

' But I was not drowning,' said Diana. 

' Well, I want to know what you've got by stayin' away 
from your place all summer ' her mother went on. 




' Her place was there,' said the minister, who followed 
Diana in. 

' Now dominie,' said Mrs. Flandin, 'you say that jes' 
'cause she's your wife. Hain't her place been empty all 
these months ? Where is a wife's place ? I should like to 
hear yo.u say.' 

' Don't you think it is where her husband wants her to 
be?' 

' And you wanted her to be away from you down there ? 
Do you mean that ? ' 

' If he had not, I should not have gone, Mrs. Flandin,' 
Diana said, and with a smile. 

'Well now, du tell ! what good did salt water do ye? 
The minister said you was gone to salt water somewheres.' 

' It did me more good than I could ever make you understand.' 

' I don't believe it ! ' said Mrs. Starling harshly. ' You 
mean it was a clever thing to play lady and sit with your 
hands before you all summer. It was good there was some? 
body at home to do the work.' 

' Not your work, Di,' said her husband good humour- 
edly, ' nor my work. I did that. Come along, and see 
what I have done.' 

He drew her off, into the little front hall or entry, from 
there through a side door into the new part of the building. 
There was a roomy, cool, bright room, lined with the minister's books ; curtained and furnished, not expensively indeed, yet with a thorough air of comfort. Taking the baby 
from her arms, Basil led the way from this room, up a short 
stairway, to chambers above which were charmingly neat, 
light and cheerful, all in order ; everything was done, everything was there that ought to be there. He laid the sleep- 
ing child down in its crib and turned to his wife with a serious face. 



 

' How will you stand it, Diana ? ' 

' Basil, I was just thinking, how will you I' 

' We can do what ought to be done ? ' said he, looking 
into her face. 

' I know you can. I think I can too, in this. And I 
think it is right to take care of mother. I am sure it is.' 

' Diana, by the Lord's help we can do right in everything.' 

' Yes, Basil ; I know it ! ' she said, meeting his eyes with 
a steady look. 

He turned away, very grave, but with a deep ejacula- 
tion of thankfulness. Diana's eyes filled; but she too 
turned away. She could add no more. It was not words 
but living, that must speak for her now. 

And it did. Even that same evening. Mrs. Flandin 
would not go away, it was too good an opportunity of gathering information about various points on which the " town " 
had been curious and divided. She kept her place till after 
supper. But all she could see was a fair, quiet demeanour ; 
an unruffled beautiful face ; and an unconscious dignity of 
carriage which was somewhat provokingly imposing. She 
saw that Diana was at home and likely to be mistress in her 
own sphere ; held in too much honour by her husband, and 
holding him in too much honour, for that a pin's point of 
malicious curiosity might find an entering place between 
them. She reported afterwards, that the minister was a 
fool and his wife another, and so they fitted. Mrs. Starling 
was inclined to be of the same opinion. 

The two most nearly concerned knew better. Fit they 
did not, though they were the only ones of all the world 
that knew it. While Diana had been away at Clifton, the 
minister had managed to make one of the company at Elmfield rather often, moved by various reasons. One effect 



 

however of this plan of action had been unfavourable to 
his own peace of mind. He saw Evan and came to know 
him ; he would know him, though the young man would 
much rather have kept aloof from contact with Diana's husband. Basil's simplicity of manner and straightforwardness 
were too much for him. And while an unwilling and enormous respect for the minister grew up in Captain Knowlton's 
mind, the minister on his part saw and felt, and perhaps exaggerated, the attractiveness of the young army officer. Basil 
was not at all given to self-depreciation ; in fact, he did not 
think of himself enough for such a mischievous mental transaction ; however he perceived the grace of figure and bear- 
ing, the air of command and the beauty of feature, which he 
thought might well take a woman's eye. ' My poor Diana ! ' 
he said to himself ; 'her fancy has caught the stamp of all 
this and will hold it. Naturally. She is not a woman to 
like and unlike. What chance for me ! ' 

Which meditations, unwholesome as they were, did not 
prevent Basil's attaching himself to Captain Knowlton's 
society, and making a friend of him, in spite of both their 
selves, as it were. The captain's mental nature, he suspected 
and found, was by no means in order to correspond with 
his physical ; and if a friend could help him, he would be 
that friend. And Basil did not see that the young officer's 
evident respect for himself and succumbing to his friendly 
advances, were a. very significant tribute to his own personal and other qualities. It was a little matter to him, indeed, such tribute, if he could not have it from his wife. 

He had everything else in her that a man's heart could 
desire ! He saw that, soon after her return from Clifton. 
Diana's demeanour had been gracious and sweet before, always, although with a shadow upon it. Now the shadow 
was gone, or changed ; he could not tell which ; she was 



. 

not gay-spirited as he had once known her ; but she wen 
about her house with a gentle grace which never failed. 
Mrs. Starling was at times exceedingly trying and irritating. 
Diana met and received it all as blandly as she would give 
her face to the west wind ; at the same time no rough wind 
could move her from the way of her duty. Mrs. Starling 
was able neither to provoke her nor prevail with her. She 
was the sweetest of ruling spirits within her house ; without 
it, she was the most indefatigable and tender of fellow- 
workers to her husband. Tender, not to him, that is, but 
to all those for whom he and she ministered. A nurse to 
the sick, a provider to the very poor, a counsellor to the 
vexed ; for such would come to her, especially among the 
younger women ; a comforter to those in trouble. Such a 
comforter ! " Lips of healing " her husband said of her 
once ; " wise, rare ; sweet as honey, but with the savour 
of the wind blowing over wild thyme." If a little of that 
sweetness could have come to him ! But while her life was 
full of observance for him, gentle and submissive as a child 
to every expressed wish of his, and watchful to meet his 
unexpressed wish, it was the grief of Diana's life that she 
did not love this man. In the reserve of her New England 
nature, I think what she felt for him was hidden even from 
herself. 

That is, I mean, as days and months went on. At 
Diana's first coming home from Clifton, no doubt her 
opinion of her own feelings, and Basil's opinion of them, 
was correct. If a change came, it came so imperceptibly 
that nobody knew it. 

Diana's beauty at this time had taken a new phasis. It 
had lost the marble rigidity and calm impassiveness which 
had characterized it during all the time of her married life 
hitherto ; and it had not regained the careless lightness of 




the days before she knew Evan. It was something lovelier 
than either ; so lovely that Basil wondered, and Mrs. Starling sometimes stared, and every lip " in town " came to 
have nothing but utterances of respect, more often utterances of devotion, for the minister's wife. I am afraid I 
cannot give you a just impression of it. For Diana's face 
had come curiously near the expression on the face of her 
own little child. Innocent, tender, pure, something like that. 
Grave, but with no clouds at all ; strong and purposeful, 
yet with an utter absence of self-will or self-consciousness. It had always been to a certain degree, innocent 
and pure, but that was negative ; and this was positive, 
the refined gold that had been through the fire. And no 
baby's face is sweeter than Diana's was now, all blossoming as it were with love and humility. If her husband had 
loved her before, the feeling of longing and despair that 
came over him when he looked at this rarefied beauty 
would be hard to tell. He had ruined her life, he reproached himself ; and she was lost to him forever. Yet, 
as I said, though Diana's face was grave, it was a gravity 
wholly without clouds ; the gravity of the summer dawn, 
when the stars are shining and the light in the East tells 
of the coming day. 

But mental changes work slowly and insensibly oft- 
times ; and day after day and week after week went by, 
each with its fulness of business and cares ; and no one in 
the little family knew exactly what forces were silently 
busy. So a year rolled round, and another year began its 
course, and ran it; and June came for the second time 
since Diana had returned from the seaside. Elmfield in 
all this time had not been revisited by its owners. 

June had come again. Windows were open, and the 
breath of roses filled the minister's study ; for Diana had 




developed lately a passion for flowers and for gardening, 
and her husband had given her with full hands all she 
wanted, and much more. Mrs. Starling had grumbled and 
been very sarcastic about it ; however, Basil had ordered 
in plants and seeds and tools and books of instruction ; 
he had become instructor himself ; and the result was, the 
parsonage, as people began to call it, was encompassed 
with a little wilderness of floral beauty which was growing 
to be the wonder of Pleasant Valley. " It will do them 
good ! " the minister said, when Diana called his attention 
to the fact that the country farmers passing by were falling 
into the habit of reining in their horses and stopping for a 
good long look. For instead of the patch of marigolds 
and hollyhocks in front of the house, all the wing inhabited by the minister and his family was surrounded with 
flowers. Roses bloomed in the beds and out of the grass 
and climbed up on the walls of the house ; white Annunciation lilies shone like stars here and there ; whole beds of 
heliotrope were preparing their perfume ; geraniums held 
up their elegant heads of every colour ; verbenas and 
mignonette and honeysuckle and red lilies and yellow 
lilies, and hardy gladiolus, were either just beginning or in 
full beauty ; with many more, too many to tell ; and the old- 
fashioned guelder rose had shaken out its white balls of 
snow, and one or two laburnums were hung thick with 
their clusters of " dropping gold." The garden was growing large, and as I said, become a wilderness of beauty. 
Nevertheless the roses kept their own, and this afternoon 
the breath of them rising above all the other sweet breaths 
that were abroad, came in and filled the minister's study. 
Diana was there alone sitting by one of the open windows, 
busy with some work ; not so busy but that she smelt the 
roses, and felt the glory of light and colour that was outside, 




and heard the hum of bees and the twitter of birds and the 
soft indistinguishable chirrup of insects, which filled the 
air. Diana sewed on, till another slight sound mingled 
with those ; the tread of a foot on the gravel walk down 
below ; then she lifted her head suddenly, and with that her 
hands and her work fell into her lap. It was long past 
mid-afternoon, and the lovely slant light striking over the 
roses and coming through the crown of a young elm, fell 
upon Basil, who was slowly sauntering along the garden 
walk with his little girl in his arms. Very slowly, and often 
standing still to exchange love passages and indulge mutual 
admiration with her. They were partly talking of the 
flowers, Diana could see ; but her own eyes had no vision 
but" for those two, the baby and the baby's father. One 
little fair fat arm was round Basil's neck ; the other tiny 
hand was sometimes stretched out towards the lilies or the 
laburnums, in critical or delighted notice-taking, the word- 
accompaniament to which Diana could not hear but could 
well guess ; at other times it was brought round ecstatically to join its companion round her father's neck, or 
lifted to his face with ringers of caressing, or thrust in 
among the locks of his hair, which last seemed to be a 
favourite pleasure. Basil would stand still at such times 
and talk to her, or wait, Diana knew with just what a smile 
in his eyes, to take the soft touches and return them. Diana's work was forgotten and her eyes were rivetted ; why 
did the scene in the garden give her such pain ? She would 
have said, if she had been asked, that it was self-reproach 
and sorrow for the inevitable. How came it, that she held 
not as near a place to Basil as her child did ? she ought ; 
but it was not so. She thought, she wished she loved him ! 
She ought to be as free to put her hand on the soft curls 
of Basil's hair as her baby was ; but they stood too far 




apart from each other, and she would as soon have dared 
anything. And Basil never looked at her so now-a-days ; 
he had found out how she felt, and knew she did not 
care for his looks ; and kind and gentle and unselfish 
as he was, yes, and strong in self-command and self renunciation, he had resigned his life-hope and left her to 
her life-sorrow. Yet Diana knew, with every smile and 
kiss to the little one what a cry of Basil's heart went out 
towards the child's mother. Only, he would never give 
that cry utterance again. ' What can I do ? ' thought 
Diana. ' I cannot bear it. And he thinks I am a great 
deal more unhappy than I am. Unhappy ? I am not unhappy if only he were not unhappy.' 

She could not explain her feelings to herself, she had 
no notion that she was jealous of her own child ; but the 
pain bit .her, and she could not endure to sit up there at the 
window and look on. Rising hastily, she dropped her work 
out of her hand and was about to go down into the garden 
to join them, when another glance shewed her that Basil had 
turned and was coming back into the house. Diana listened to them as they mounted the stairs, Basil's feet and 
the baby's voice sounding together, with a curious unrest 
at her heart, and her eyes met the pair eagerly as they 
entered the room. From what impulse she could not have 
told, she advanced to meet them and stretched out her 
hands to take the child ; which however, with a little con- 
fident cry of delight turned from her and clasped both little 
arms again round her father's neck. Basil smiled ; Diana 
tried to follow suit. 

' She would rather be with you than with me,' she re- 
marked however. 

' I wonder at her bad taste ! ' said Basil. But he turned 
his face to the baby and laid it gently against her soft 
cheek. 



'It is because you are stronger' Diana went on. 

' Is it ? ' 

' That is one thing. You may notice, children always 
like strong arms.' 

' Her mother's arms are not weak.' 

' No but I am not so strong as you, Basil, bodily or
