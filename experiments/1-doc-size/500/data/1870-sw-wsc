and you want to know if it's my children 
have done it?" said the woman. "'Cos they 
don't go to no school that you ever see." 

" I did not mean any such thing," said 
Maria, quite taken aback. 

" Well, what did you mean ? " the woman 
asked sharply. 

" We want to see the children," Matilda 
put in. " May we come in and get warm, if 
you please ? " 

The woman still held the door in her hand, 
and looked at the last speaker from head to 
foot; then half reluctantly opened the door. 

" I don't know as it'll hurt you to come in," 
she said ; " but it won't do you much good ; 
the place is all in a clutter and it always is. 
Come along in, if you want to ! and shut the 




door ; 'tain't so warm here you'll need the 
wind in to help you. Want the children, did 
you say ? what do you want of 'em ? " 

Matilda thought privately that the wind 
would have been a good companion ; fter all ; 
no sooner was the door shut, than all remem- 
brance of fresh air faded away. An inexpressible atmosphere filled the house, in which 
frying fat, smoke, soapsuds, and the odour of 
old garments, mingled and combined in proportions known to none but such dwelling 
places. Yet it was not as bad as it might 
have been, by many degrees ; the house was 
a little frame house, open at the joints ; and 
it stood in the midst of heaven's free air ; all 
the winds that came from the mountains and 
the river swept over and around it ; came 
down the chimney sometimes, and breathed 
blessed breaths through every opening door 
and shackling window frame. But to Matilda 
it seemed as bad as could be. So it seemed 
to her eyes too. Nothing clean ; nothing 
comfortable ; nothing in order ; scraps of 



 

dinner on the floor ; scraps of work under the 
table ; a dirty cat in the corner by the stove ; 
a wash tub occupying the other corner. The 
woman had her sleeves rolled up, and now 
plung d her arms into the tub again. 

" Y >u can put in a stick of wood, if you 
want to," she said; " I guess the fire's got 
down. What did you come here for, hey ? 
I hain't heard that yet, and I'm in a takin' to 
find out." 

" We thought maybe your children might 
like to go to Sunday school," said Maria 
with a great deal of trepidation ; " and we 
just came to ask them. That's all." 

" How did ye know but they went al- 
ready ? " the woman asked, looking at Maria 
from the corner of her eye. 

" I didn't know. I just came to ask 
them." 

" Well, I just advise you not to mix yourself with people's affairs till you do know a 
little about 'em. What business is it o' yourn, 
hey, whether my children goes to Sunday 



 

school ? Sunday school ! what a poke it 
is!" 

" They did not come to our Sunday school," 
said Matilda, for her sister was nonplussed ; 
" and we would like to have them come ; un- 
less they were going somewhere else." 

" They may speak for themselves," said 
Mrs. Dow ; and she opened an inner door 
and called in a shrill voice " Araminty ! 
Jemimy ! Alexander ! come right along 
down, and if you don't I'll whip ye." 

She went back to her washing-tub, and 
Maria and Matilda looked to see three depressed specimens of young human life appear 
at that inner door ; but first tumbled down 
and burst in a sturdy, rugged young rascal 
of some eight or nine years ; and after him a 
girl a little older, with the blackest of black 
eyes and hair, the latter hanging straight over 
her face and ears. The eyes of both fastened 
upon their strange visiters, and seemed as if 
they would move no more. 

" Them girls is come to get you to their 



 

Sunday school," said the mother. "Don't 
you want for to go ? " 

No answer, and no move of the black eyes. 
Matilda certainly thought they looked as if 
they feared the lifting of no mortal hand, 
their mother's or any other. 

" Would you like to go to Sunday school ? " 
inquired Maria politely, driven to speak by 
the necessities of the silence. But she might 
as well have asked Mrs. Dow's wash tub. 
The mother laughed a little to herself. 

" Guess you might as well go along back 
the road ye come ! " she said. " You won't 
get my Araminty Jemimy into no Sunday 
school o' yourn this time. Maybe when she's 
growed older and wiser-like, she'll come and 
see you. She don' know what a Sunday 
school's like. She thinks it's some sort of a 
trap." 

" I ain't afraid ! " spoke out black eyes. 

" I didn't say you was," said her mother. 
" I might ha' said you was cunnin' enough to 
keep your foot out of it" 




It is not a trap," said Matilda boldly. It 
is a pleasant place, where we sing, and learn 
nice things." 

" My children don't want to learn none o' 
your nice things," said the woman. " I can 
teach 'em to home." 

" But you don't! " said black eyes. " You 
don't never learn us nothing I " 

There was not the slightest sweet desire 
of learning evidenced in this speech. It 
breathed nothing but defiance. 

" Alexander, won't you come ? " said 
Matilda timidly, as her sister moved to the 
door. For Maria's courage gave out. But 
at that question the young urchin addressed 
set up a roar of hoarse laughter, throwing 
himself down and rolling over on the floor. 
His mother shoved him out of her way with 
a push that was very like a kick, and his 
sister seizing a wringing wet piece of clothes 
from the wash tub, dropped it spitefully on 
his head. There was promise of a fight ; and 
Matilda and Maria hurried out. They hastened their steps through the garden, and even 
out in the high road they ran a little to get 
away from Mrs. Dow's neighborhood. 

" Well ! " said Maria, " what do you think 
now, Tilly? I hope you have got enough 
for once of this kind of thing. I promise you 
I have." 

" Hush ! " said Matilda. " Some one is 
calling." 

They stopped and turned. A shout was 
certainly sent after them from the gate they 
had quitted ; " Girls, hollo ! Sunday 
school girls, hollo ! " 

Do you hear ? " said Matilda. 

" Sunday school girls ! Come back ! " 

" What can they want ? " said Maria. 

" We must go see," said Matilda. 

So they went towards the gate again. By 
the gate they could soon see the shock head 
of Alexander ; he had got rid of the wash 
tub and his mother and his sister all three ; 
and he was waiting there to speak to them. 
The girls hurried .up again till they con- 




fronted his grinning face on the other side 
of the gate. 

" What do you want ? " said Maria. 
What do you call us back for? " 

" I didn't call you," said the boy. 

" Yes, you did ; you called us back ; and 
we have come back all this way. What do 
you want to say ? " 

Alexander's face was dull, even in his 
triumph. No sparkle or gleam of mischief 
prepared the girls for his next speech. 

" I say ain't you green ! " 

But another shout of rude laughter followed 
it; and another roll and tumble, though these 
last were on the snow. Maria and her sister turned and walked away till out of hearing. 

" I never heard of such horrible people ! " 
said Maria ; " never ! And this is what you 
get, Matilda, by your dreadful going after 
Sunday scholars and such things. I do hope 
you have got enough of it." 

But Matilda only drew deep sighs, one 



 

after another, at intervals, and made no 
reply. 

" Don't you see what a goose you are ? " 
persisted Maria. " Don't you see ? " 

No," said Matilda. I don't see that." 

" Well, you might. Just look at what a 
time we have had, only because you fancied 
there were two children at that house." 

Well, there are two children." 

Such children ! " said Maria, 

" I wish Mr. Richmond would go to see 
them," said Matilda. 

" It would be no use for Mr. Richmond or 
anybody to go and see them," said Maria. 
" They are too wicked." 

" But you cannot tell beforehand," said 
Matilda. 

" And so I say, Tilly, the only way is to 
keep out of such places. I hope you'll be 
content now." 

Matilda was hardly content ; for the sighs 
kept coming every now and then. So they 
went down the hill again, and over the bridge, 



 

past the glen and the burnt mill, and began 
to go up on the other side. Now across the 
way, at the top of the bank that overhung the 
dell, there stood a house of more than common size and elegance, in the midst of grounds 
that seemed to be carefully planted. A fine 
brick wall enclosed these grounds on the road- 
side, and at the top of the hill an iron gate 
gave entrance to them. 

O Tilly," exclaimed Maria, " the Lard- 
ners' gate is open. Look! Suppose we go 
in." 

" I should not like to go in," said the little 
one. 

" Why not ? There's nobody at home ; 
they haven't come yet ; and it's such a good 
chance. You know, Clarissa says that people 
have leave to go into people's great places 
and see them, in England, where she has 
been." 

" But this is not a great place, and we have 
not leave," urged Matilda. 

" O well, I'm going in. Come ! we'll just 



go in for a minute. It's no harm. Come' 
just for a minute." 

Matilda, however, stopped at the gate, and 
stood there waiting for her sister ; while Maria 
stepped in cautiously and made her way as 
far as the front of the house. Here she turned 
and beckoned to Matilda to join her; but 
the little one stood fast. 

" What does she want of you ? " a voice 
asked at her elbow. Matilda started. Two 
ladies were there. 

" She beckoned for me to go in where she 
is," said Matilda. 

" Well, why don't you go in ? " 

The voice was kindly ; the face of the lady 
was bending towards her graciously ; but who 
it was, Matilda did not know. 

" We have no leave to go in," she said. " I 
do not like to be there." 

" I dare say the people would let you come 
in, if they knew you wished it." 

" They do not know," said Matilda. 

" What a charming child ! " said the lady 




apart to her companion. " My dear," she 
went on to Matilda, " will you come in on 
my invitation ? This is my house, and you 
are welcome. I shall be as glad to see you as 
you to see the place. Come ! " 

And she took Matilda's hand and led her in. 

Just at the crown of the bank the house 
stood, and from here the view was very lovely, 
even now in winter. Over the wide river, 
which lay full in view with its ice covering, to 
the opposite shores and the magnificent range 
of mountains, which from Matilda's window 
at home she could just see in a little bit. The 
full range lay here before the eye, white with 
snow, coloured and brightened by the sinking 
sun which threw wonderful lights across them 
and revealed beautiful depths and shadows. 
Still, cold, high, far-off; their calm majesty 
held Matilda's eye. 

" Are you looking at the mountains ? " said 

the lady. " Yes, now come in and you shall 

look at my flowers. Your sister may come 

too," she added, nodding kindly to Maria; but 



she kept Matilda's hand, and so led her first 
upon the piazza, which was a single step above 
the ground, then into the hall. An octagon 
hall, paved with marble, and with large white 
statues holding post around its walls, and a 
vase of flowers on the balustrade at the foot 
of the staircase. But those were not the 
flowers the lady had meant; she passed on 
to one of the inner rooms and from that to 
another, and finally into a pretty greenhouse, 
with glass windows looking out to the moun- 
tains and the river, filled on this side of the 
windows with tropical bloom. While the 
girls gazed in wonder, the lady stepped back 
into the room they had left, and threw off her 
wrappings. When she came again to the 
girls in the greenhouse they hardly knew 
which to look at, her or the flowers ; her dress 
and whole appearance were so unlike anything they had ever seen. 

" Which do you like best ? " she said. " The 
roses you know, of course ; these are camellias, 
and these and these red ones too ; all 



 

camellias ; these are myrtle ; these are heath ; 
these are geraniums. All those are geraniums. 
This is Eupatorium those, yes, those are 
Azaleas, and those, and all those. Yes, all 
Azaleas. You like them ? This is Bigonia. 
What do you like best ? " 

It was a long while before Matilda could 
divide and define her admiration enough to 
tell what she liked best. Carnations and 
heath were found at last to have her best 
favour. The lady cut a bouquet for her with 
plenty of carnations and heath, but a variety 
of other beauty too ; then led the girls into 
the other room and offered them some rich 
cake and a glass of what Matilda supposed to 
be wine. She took the cake and refused the 
cordial. 

" It is very sweet," said the lady. You 
will not dislike it ; and it will warm you, this 
cold afternoon." 

" I may not drink wine, ma'am, thank you," 
Matilda answered. 

" It is not wine. Does it make you sick, 



 

my dear ? Are you afraid to try it ? Your 
sister is not afraid. I think it will do you 
good." 

Being thus reassured, Matilda put the glass 
to her lips, but immediately set it down again. 

" You do not like it?" said the lady. 

" I like it ; but it is strong ? " said Matilda 
inquiringly. 

" Why yes, it would not be good for any- 
thing if it were not strong. Never mind that 
if you like it. The glass does not hold but 
a thimbleful and a thimbleful will not hurt 
you. Why, why not, my dear ? " 

Matilda looked up, and coloured and hesitated. 

" I have promised not," she said. 

"So solemnly?" said the lady laughing. 
"Is it your mother you have promised ? " 

No, ma'am." 

" Not your mother ? You have a mother ? " 

" O yes, ma'am." 

" Would she have any objection ? " 

No, ma'am, I believe not." 



 

" Then whom have you made your promise 
to ? Is it a religious scruple that some one 
has taught you ? " 

" I have promised to do all I could for helping temperance work," Matilda said at last. 

She was answered with a little ringing 
laugh, not unkindly but amused; arid then 
her friend said gravely, 

" Your taking a glass of cordial in this 
house would not affect anything or anybody, 
little one. It would do me, no harm. I drink a 
glass of wine every day with my dinner. I 
shall go on doing it just the same. It will not 
ma^e a bit of difference to me, whether you 
take your cordial or not." 

But Matilda looked at the lady, and did 
not look at her glass. 

"Do you think it will?" said the lady
