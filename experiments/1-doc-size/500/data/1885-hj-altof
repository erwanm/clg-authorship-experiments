particular, of the condition of the Durance at some 
point that I have forgotten. At Avignon, an hour 
later, I found the water in some of the streets. The 



  

sky cleared in the evening, the moon lighted up the 
submerged suburbs, and the population again collected 
in the high places to enjoy the spectacle. It exhibited 
a certain sameness, however, and by nine o clock there 
was considerable animation in the Place Crillon, where 
there is nothing to be seen but the front of the theatre 
and of several cafes in addition, indeed, to a statue 
of this celebrated brave, whose valor redeemed some 
of the numerous military disasters of the reign of 
Louis XV. The next morning the lower quarters of 
the town were in a pitiful state; the situation seemed 
to me odious. To express my disapproval of it, I lost 
no time in taking the train for Orange, which, with its 
other attractions, had the merit of not being seated on 
the Rhone. It was my destiny to move northward; 
but even if I had been at liberty to follow a less un 
natural course I should not then have undertaken it, 
inasmuch as the railway between Avignon and Mar 
seilles was credibly reported to be (in places) under 
water. This was the case with almost everything but 
the line itself, on the way to Orange. The day proved 
splendid, and its brilliancy only lighted up the desola 
tion. Farmhouses and cottages were up to their middle 
in the yellow liquidity; haystacks looked like dull little 
islands; windows and doors gaped open, without faces; 
and interruption and flight were represented in the 
scene. It was brought home to me that the popula 
tions rurales have many different ways of suffering, 
and my heart glowed with a grateful sense of cockney- 
ism. It was under the influence of this emotion that 





I alighted at Orange, to visit a collection of eminently 
civil monuments. 

The collection consists of but two objects, but these 
objects are so fine that I will let the word pass. One 
of them is a triumphal arch, supposedly of the period 
of Marcus Aurelius; the other is a fragment, magnifi 
cent in its ruin, of a Roman theatre. But for these 
fine Roman remains and for its name, Orange is a 
perfectly featureless little town, without the Rhone 
which, as I have mentioned, is several miles distant 
to help it to a physiognomy. It seems one of the 
oddest things that this obscure French borough 
obscure, I mean, in our modern era, for the Gallo- 
Roman Arausio must have been, judging it by its 
arches and theatre, a place of some importance 
should have given its name to the heirs apparent of 
the throne of Holland, and been borne by a king of 
England who had sovereign rights over it. During 
the Middle Ages it formed part of an independent 
principality; but in 1531 it fell, by the marriage of 
one of its princesses, who had inherited it, into the 
family of Nassau. I read in my indispensable Mur 
ray that it was made over to France by the treaty of 
Utrecht. The arch of triumph, which stands a little 
way out of the town, is rather a pretty than an im 
posing vestige of the Romans. If it had greater purity 
of style, one might say of it that it belonged to the 
same family of monuments as the Maison Carree at 
Nimes. It has three passages, the middle much 
higher than the others, and a very elevated attic. 



  

The vaults of the passages are richly sculptured, and 
the whole monument is covered with friezes and 
military trophies. This sculpture is rather mixed; 
much of it is broken and defaced, and the rest seemed 
to me ugly, though its workmanship is praised. The 
arch is at once well preserved and much injured. Its 
general mass is there, and as Roman monuments go 
it is remarkably perfect; but it has suffered, in patches, 
from the extremity of restoration. It is not, on the 
whole, of absorbing interest. It has a charm, never 
theless, which comes partly from its soft, bright yellow 
color, partly from a certain elegance of shape, of ex 
pression; and on that well-washed Sunday morning, 
with its brilliant tone, surrounded by its circle of thin 
poplars, with the green country lying beyond it and a 
low blue horizon showing through its empty portals, 
it made, very sufficiently, a picture that hangs itself 
to one of the lateral hooks of the memory. I can 
take down the modest composition, and place it before 
me as I write. I see the shallow, shining puddles in 
the hard, fair French road; the pale blue sky, diluted 
by days of rain; the disgarnished autumnal fields; the 
mild sparkle of the low horizon; the solitary figure in 
sabots, with a bundle under its arm, advancing along 
the chaussee; and in the middle I see the little ochre- 
colored monument, which, in spite of its antiquity, 
looks bright and gay, as everything must look in 
France of a fresh Sunday morning. 

It is true that this was not exactly the appearance 
of the Roman theatre, which lies on the other side of 





the town; a fact that did not prevent me from making 
my way to it in less than five minutes, through a suc 
cession of little streets concerning which I have no 
observations to record. None of the Roman remains 
in the south of France are more impressive than this 
stupendous fragment. An enormous mound rises above 
the place, which was formerly occupied I quote from 
Murray first by a citadel of the Romans, then by a 
castle of the princes of Nassau, razed by Louis XIV. 
Facing this hill a mighty wall erects itself, thirty-six 
metres high, and composed of massive blocks of dark 
brown stone, simply laid one on the other; the whole 
naked, rugged surface of which suggests a natural cliff 
(say of the Vaucluse order) rather than an effort of 
human, or even of Roman labor. It is the biggest 
thing at Orange, it is bigger than all Orange put to 
gether, and its permanent massiveness makes light 
of the shrunken city. The face it presents to the town 
the top of it garnished with two rows of brackets, 
perforated with holes to receive the staves of the vela 
rium bears the traces of more than one tier of orna 
mental arches; though how these flat arches were 
applied, or incrusted, upon the wall, I do not profess 
to explain. You pass through a diminutive postern 
which seems in proportion about as high as the en 
trance of a rabbit-hutch into the lodge of the custo 
dian, who introduces you to the interior of the theatre. 
Here the mass of the hill affronts you, which the in 
genious Romans treated simply as the material of their 
auditorium. They inserted their stone seats, in a 



  

semicircle , in the slope of the hill , and planted their 
colossal wall opposite to it. This wall, from the inside, 
is, if possible, even more imposing. It formed the 
back of the stage, the permanent scene, and its 
enormous face was coated with marble. It contains 
three doors, the middle one being the highest, and 
having above it, far aloft, a deep niche, apparently 
intended for an imperial statue. A few of the benches 
remain on the hillside, which, however, is mainly a 
confusion of fragments. There is part of a corridor 
built into the hill, high up, and on the crest are the 
remnants of the demolished castle. The whole place 
is a kind of wilderness of ruin; there are scarcely any 
details; the great feature is the overtopping wall. This 
wall being the back of the scene, the space left be 
tween it and the chord of the semicircle (of the audi 
torium) which formed the proscenium is rather less 
than one would have supposed. In other words, the 
stage was very shallow, and appears to have been ar 
ranged for a number of performers standing in a line, 
like a company of soldiers. There stands the silent 
skeleton, however, as impressive by what it leaves you 
to guess and wonder about as by what it tells you. 
It has not the sweetness, the softness of melancholy, 
of the theatre at Aries; but it is more extraordinary, 
and one can imagine only tremendous tragedies being 
enacted there, 

"Presenting Thebes or Pelops line." 
At either end of the stage, coming forward, is an 


immense wing, immense in height, I mean, as it 
reaches to the top of the scenic wall; the other dimen 
sions are not remarkable. The division to the right, 
as you face the stage, is pointed out as the green 
room; its portentous altitude and the open arches at 
the top give it the air of a well. The compartment 
on the left is exactly similar, save that it opens into 
the traces of other chambers, said to be those of a 
hippodrome adjacent to the theatre. Various fragments 
are visible which refer themselves plausibly to such an 
establishment; the greater axis of the hippodrome would 
appear to have been on a line with the triumphal 
arch. This is all I saw, and all there was to see, of 
Orange, which had a very rustic, bucolic aspect, and 
where I was not even called upon to demand break 
fast at the hotel. The entrance of this resort might 
have been that of a stable of the Roman days. 



XXXVII. 

I HAVE been trying to remember whether I fasted 
all the way to Macon, which I reached at an advanced 
hour of the evening, and think I must have done so 
except for the purchase of a box of nougat at Monte- 
limart (the place is famous for the manufacture of 
this confection, which, at the station, is hawked at the 
windows of the train) and for a bouillon, very much 
later, at Lyons. The journey beside the Rhone 
past Valence, past Tournon, past Vienne would 



  

have been charming, on that luminous Sunday, but 
for two disagreeable accidents. The express from 
Marseilles, which I took at Orange, was full to over 
flowing; and the only refuge I could find was an 
inside angle in a carriage laden with Germans, who 
had command of the windows, which they occupied 
as strongly as they have been known to occupy other 
strategical positions. I scarcely know, however, why 
I linger on this particular discomfort, for it was but 
a single item in a considerable list of grievances, 
grievances dispersed through six weeks of constant 
railway travel in France. I have not touched upon 
them at an earlier stage of this chronicle, but my re 
serve is not owing to any sweetness of association. 
This form of locomotion, in the country of the ameni 
ties, is attended with a dozen discomforts; almost all 
the conditions of the business are detestable. They 
force the sentimental tourist again and again to ask 
himself whether, in consideration of such mortal an 
noyances, the game is worth the candle. Fortunately, 
a railway journey is a good deal like a sea voyage; 
its miseries fade from the mind as soon as you arrive. 
That is why I completed, to my great satisfaction, 
my little tour in France. Let this small effusion of 
ill-nature be my first and last tribute to the whole 
despotic gare: the deadly salle d attente, the insuffer 
able delays over one 's luggage, the porterless platform, 
the overcrowded and illiberal train. How many a 
time did I permit myself the secret reflection that it 
is in perfidious Albion that they order this matter 


best! How many a time did the eager British mer 
cenary, clad in velveteen and clinging to the door of 
the carriage as it glides into the station, revisit my 
invidious dreams! The paternal porter and the re 
sponsive hansom are among the best gifts of the Eng 
lish genius to the world. I hasten to add, faithful 
to my habit (so insufferable to some of my friends) of 
ever and again readjusting the balance after I have 
given it an honest tip, that the bouillon at Lyons, 
which I spoke of above, was, though by no means an 
ideal bouillon, much better than any I could have 
obtained at an English railway station. After I had 
imbibed it, I sat in the train (which waited a long 
time at Lyons) and, by the light of one of the big 
lamps on the platform, read all sorts of disagreeable 
things in certain radical newspapers which I had 
bought at the book-stall. I gathered from these sheets 
that Lyons was in extreme commotion. The Rhone 
and the Saone, which form a girdle for the splendid 
town, were almost in the streets, as I could easily be 
lieve from what I had seen of the country after leav 
ing Orange. The Rhone, all the way to Lyons, had 
been in all sorts of places where it had no business 
to be, and matters were naturally not improved by 
its confluence with the charming and copious stream 
which, at Macon, is said once to have given such a 
happy opportunity to the egotism of the capital. A 
visitor from Paris (the anecdote is very old), being 
asked on the quay of that city whether he didn 't ad 
mire the Saone, replied good-naturedly that it was 



  

very pretty, but that in Paris they spelled it with 
the ei. This moment of general alarm at Lyons had 
been chosen by certain ingenious persons (I credit 
them, perhaps, with too sure a prevision of the rise 
of the rivers) for practising further upon the appre 
hensions of the public. A bombshell filled with 
dynamite had been thrown into a cafe", and various 
votaries of the comparatively innocuous petit verre 
had been wounded (I am not sure whether any one 
had been killed) by the irruption. Of course there had 
been arrests and incarcerations, and the "Intransi- 
geant" and the "Rappel" were filled with the echoes 
of the explosion. The tone of these organs is rarely 
edifying, and it had never been less so than on this 
occasion. I wondered, as I looked through them, 
whether I was losing all my radicalism; and then I 
wondered whether, after all, I had any to lose. Even 
in so long a wait as that tiresome delay at Lyons I 
failed to settle the question, any more than I made 
up my mind as to the probable future of the militant 
democracy, or the ultimate form of a civilization which 
should have blown up everything else. A few days 
later, the waters went down at Lyons; but the de 
mocracy has not gone down. 

I remember vividly the remainder of that evening 
which I spent at Macon, remember it with a chatter 
ing of the teeth. I know not what had got into the 
place; the temperature, for the last day of October, 
was eccentric and incredible. These epithets may 
also be applied to the hotel itself, an extraordinary 





structure, all facade, which exposes an uncovered rear 
to the gaze of nature. There is a demonstrative, 
voluble landlady, who is of course part of the fagade; 
but everything behind her is a trap for the winds, 
with chambers, corridors, staircases, all exhibited to 
the sky, as if the outer wall of the house had been 
lifted off. It would have been delightful for Florida, 
but it didn 't do for Burgundy, even on the eve of 
November ist, so that I suffered absurdly from the 
rigor of a season that had not yet begun. There was 
something in the air; I felt it the next day, even on 
the sunny quay of the Saone, where in spite of a fine 
southerly exposure I extracted little warmth from the 
reflection that Alphonse de Lamartine had often trod 
den the flags. Macon struck me, somehow, as suffer 
ing from a chronic numbness, and there was nothing 
exceptionally cheerful in the remarkable extension of 
the river. It was no longer a river, it had become 
a lake; and from my window, in the painted face of 
the inn, I saw that the opposite bank had been moved 
back, as it were, indefinitely. Unfortunately, the various 
objects with which it was furnished had not been 
moved as well, the consequence of which was an 
extraordinary confusion in the relations of things. 
There were always poplars to be seen, but the poplar 
had become an aquatic plant. Such phenomena, 
however, at Macon attract but little attention, as the 
Saone, at certain seasons of the year, is nothing if not 
expansive. The people are as used to it as they ap 
peared to be to the bronze statue of Lamartine, which 



  

is the principal monument of the place, and which, re 
presenting the poet in a frogged overcoat and top- 
boots, improvising in a high wind, struck me as even 
less casual in its attitude than monumental sculpture 
usually succeeds in being. It is true that in its pre 
sent position I thought better of this work of art, which 
is from the hand of M. Falquiere, than when I had 
seen it through the factitious medium of the Salon of 
1876. I walked up the hill where the older part of 
Macon lies , in search of the natal house of the amant 
d Elvire, the Petrarch whose Vaucluse was the bosom 
of the public. The Guide- Joanne quotes from "Les 
Confidences" a description of the birthplace of the 
poet, whose treatment of the locality is indeed poetical. 
It tallies strangely little with the reality, either as re 
gards position or other features; and it may be said 
to be, not an aid, but a direct obstacle, to a discovery 
of the house. A very humble edifice, in a small back 
street, is designated by a municipal tablet, set into its 
face, as the scene of Lamartine 's advent into the world. 
He himself speaks of a vast and lofty structure, at the 
angle of a place, adorned with iron clamps, with a 
porte haute et large and many other peculiarities. The 
house with the tablet has two meagre stories above 
the basement, and (at present, at least) an air of ex 
treme shabbiness; the place, moreover, never can have 
been vast. Lamartine was accused of writing history 
incorrectly, and apparently he started wrong at first: 
it had never become clear to him where he was born. 
Or is the tablet wrong? If the house is small, the 
tablet is very big. 



XXXVIII. 

THE foregoing reflections occur, in a cruder form, 
as it were, in my note-book, where I find this remark 
appended to them: "Don't take leave of Lamartine on 
that contemptuous note; it will be easy to think of 
something more sympathetic!" Those friends of mine, 
mentioned a little while since, who accuse me of always 
tipping back the balance, could not desire a paragraph 
more characteristic; but I wish to give no further evi 
dence of such infirmities, and will therefore hurry away 
from the subject, hurry away in the train which, very 
early on a crisp, bright morning, conveyed me, by way 
of an excursion, to the ancient city of Bourg-en-Bresse. 
Shining in early light, the Saone was spread, like a 
smooth, white tablecloth, over a considerable part of 
the flat country that I traversed. There is no provision 
made in this image for the long, transparent screens 
of thin-twigged trees which rose at intervals out of 
the watery plain; but as, under the circumstances, 
there seemed to be no provision for them in fact, I 
will let my metaphor go for what it is worth. My 
journey was (as I remember it) of about an hour and 
a half; but I passed no object of interest, as the phrase 
is, whatever. The phrase hardly applies even to Bourg 
itself, which is simply a town quelconque, as M. Zola 
would say. Small, peaceful, rustic, it stands in the 
midst of the great dairy-feeding plains of Bresse, of 
which fat county, sometime property of the house of 
Savoy, it was the modest capital. The blue masses 
of the Jura give it a creditable horizon, but the only 
nearer feature it can point to is its famous sepulchral 
church. This edifice lies at a fortunate distance from 
the town, which, though inoffensive, is of too common 
a stamp to consort with such a treasure. All I ever 
knew of the church of Brou I had gathered, years 
ago, from Matthew Arnold 's beautiful poem, which 
bears its name. I remember thinking, in those years, 
that it was impossible verses could be more touching 
than these; and as I stood before the object of my 
pilgrimage, in the gay French light (though the place 
was so dull), I recalled the spot where I had first read 
them, and where I read them again and yet again, 
wondering whether it would ever be my fortune to 
visit the church of Brou. The spot in question was 
an armchair in a window which looked out on some 
cows in a field; and whenever I glanced at the cows 
it came over me I scarcely know why that I should 
probably never behold the structure reared by the 
Duchess Margaret. Some of our visions never come 
to pass; but we must be just, others do. "So sleep, 
forever sleep, O princely pair!" I remembered that 
line of Matthew Arnold s, and the stanza about the 
Duchess Margaret coming to watch the builders on 
her palfry white. Then there came to me something 





in regard to the moon shining on winter nights through 
the cold clere-story. The tone of the place at that 
hour was not at all lunar; it was cold and bright, but 
with the chill of an autumn morning; yet this, even 
with the fact of the unexpected remoteness of the 
church from the Jura added to it, did not prevent me 
from feeling that I looked at a monument in the pro 
duction of which or at least in the effect of which 
on the tourist mind of to-day Matthew Arnold had 
been much concerned. By a pardonable license he 
has placed it a few miles nearer to the forests of the 
Jura than it stands at present. It is very true that, 
though the mountains in the sixteenth century can 
hardly have been in a different position, the plain 
which separates the church from them may have been 
bedecked with woods. The visitor to-day cannot help 
wondering why the beautiful building, with its splendid 
works of art, is dropped down in that particular spot, 
which looks so accidental and arbitrary. But there 
are reasons for most things, and there were reasons 
why the church of Brou should be at Brou, which is 
a vague little suburb of a vague little town. 

The responsibility rests, at any rate, upon the 
Duchess Margaret, Margaret of Austria, daughter of 
the Emperor Maximilian and his wife Mary of Bur 
gundy, daughter of Charles the Bold. This lady has 
a high name in history, having been regent of the 
Netherlands in behalf of her nephew, the Emperor 
Charles V., of whose early education she had had the 
care. She married in 1501 Philibert the Handsome, 



  

Duke of Savoy, to whom the province of Bresse be 
longed, and who died two years later. She had been 
betrothed, as a child, to Charles VIII. of France, and 
was kept for some time at the French court, that of 
her prospective father-in-law, Louis XL; but she was 
eventually repudiated, in order that her fiance might 
marry Anne of Brittany, an alliance so magnificently 
political that we almost condone the offence to a 
sensitive princess. Margaret did not want for hus 
bands, however, inasmuch as before her marriage to 
Philibert she had been united to John of Castile, son 
of Ferdinand V., King of Aragon, an episode ter 
minated, by the death of the Spanish prince, within a 
year. She was twenty-two years regent of the Nether
