sentimental that whatever capacity she might have for 
responding to a devotion or for desiring it was at any rate 
not in the direction of vague philandering. With him cer- 
tainly she had no disposition to philander. Sherringham was 
almost afraid to think of this, lest it should beget in him a 
rage convertible mainly into caring for her more. Rage or 
no rage, it would be charming to be in love with her if there 
were no complications ; but the complications were in advance 
just what was clearest in the business. He was perhaps cold- 
blooded to think of them ; but it must be remembered that 
they were the particular thing which his training had equipped 
him for dealing with. He was at all events not too cold- 
blooded to have, for the two months of his holiday, very little 
inner vision of anything more abstract than Miriam's face. 
The desire to see it again was as pressing as thirst ; but he 
tried to teach himself the endurance of the traveller in the 
desert. He kept the Channel between them, but his spirit 
moved every day an inch nearer to her, until (and it was not 
long) there were no more inches left. The last thing he 
expected the future ambassadress to have been was a fille de 
theatre. The answer to this objection was of course that 
Miriam was not yet so much of one but that he could easily 
head her off. Then came worrying retorts to that, chief 
among which was the sense that to his artistic conscience 
heading her off would be simple shallowness. The poor girl 
had a right to her chance, and he should not really alter any- 
thing by taking it away from her ; for was she not the artist 
to the tips of her tresses (the ambassadress never in the 
world), and would she not take it out in something else if one 
were to make her deviate ? So certain was that irrepressible 
deviltry to insist ever on its own. 

I Besides, could one make her deviate? If she had no dis- 
position to philander, what was his warrant for supposing that 
she could be corrupted into respectability ? How could the 





career (his career) speak to a nature which had glimpses, as 
vivid as they were crude, of such a different range, and for 
which success meant quite another sauce to the dish ? "Would 
the brilliancy of marrying Peter Sherringham be such a bribe 
to relinquishment ? How could he think so without fatuity 
how could he regard himself as a high prize ? Relinquishment 
of the opportunity to exercise a rare talent was not, in the 
nature of things, an easy effort to a young lady who was con- 
ceited as well as ambitious. Besides, she might eat her cake 
and have it might make her fortune both on the stage and 
in the world. Successful actresses had ended by marrying 
dukes, and was not that better than remaining obscure and 
marrying a commoner ? There were moments when Sherring- 
ham tried to think that Miriam's talent was not a force to 
reckon with ; there was so little to show for it as yet that the 
caprice of believing in it would perhaps suddenly leave her. 
But his suspicion that it was real was too uneasy to make 
such an experiment peaceful, and he came back moreover to 
his deepest impression that of her being of the turn of mind 
for which the only consistency is talent. Had not Madame 
Carre said at the last that she could " do anything " ? It was 
true that if Madame Carre had been mistaken in the first 
place she might also be mistaken in the second. But in this 
latter case she would be mistaken with him, and such an error 
would be too like a truth. 

I ought possibly to hesitate to say how much Sherringham 
felt the discomfort, for him, of the advantage that Miriam had 
of him the advantage of her presenting herself in a light 
which rendered any passion that he might entertain an impli- 
cation of duty as well as of pleasure. Why there should be 
this implication was more than he could say ; sometimes he 
declared to himself that he was superstitious for seeing it. 
He didn't know, he could scarcely conceive of another case 
of the same general type in which he would have seen it. In 
foreign countries there were very few ladies of Miss Booth's 
intended profession who would not have regarded it as too 
strong an order that to console them for not being admitted 
into drawing-rooms they should have no offset but the exercise 
of a virtue in which no one would believe. Because in foreign 
countries actresses were not admitted into drawing-rooms : 
that was a pure English drollery, ministering equally little to 
histrionics and to the tone of these resorts. Did the sanctity 
which to his imagination made it a burden to have to reckon 
with Miriam come from her being English ? Sherringham 





could remember cases in which that privilege operated as 
little as possible as a restriction. It came a great deal from 
Mrs. Rooth, in whom he apprehended depths of calculation 
as to what she might achieve for her daughter by " working" 
the idea of a blameless life. Her romantic turn of mind 
would not in the least prevent her from regarding that idea 
as a substantial capital, to be laid out to the best worldly 
advantage. Miriam's essential irreverence was capable, on a 
pretext, of making mince-meat of it that he was sure of ; 
for the only capital she recognized was the talent which some 
day managers and agents would outbid each other in paying 
for. But she was a good-natured creature ; she was fond of 
her mother, would do anything to oblige (that might work in 
all sorts of ways), and would probably like the loose slippers 
of blamelessness quite as well as the high standards of the 
opposite camp. 

Sherringham, I may add, had no desire that she should 
indulge a different preference : it was foreign to him to com- 
pute the probabilities of a young lady's misbehaving for his 
advantage (that seemed to him definitely base), and he would 
have thought himself a blackguard if, professing a tenderness 
for Miriam, he had not wished the thing that was best for her. 
The thing that was best for her would no doubt be to become 
the wife of the man to whose suit she should incline her ear. 
That this would be the best thing for the gentleman in 
question was however a very different matter, and Sherring- 
ham's final conviction was that it would never do for him to 
act the part of that hypothetic personage. He asked for no 
removal and no extension of leave, and he proved to himself 
how well he knew what he was about by never addressing a 
line, during his absence, to the Hotel de la Garonne. He 
would simply go straight and inflict as little injury upon 
Peter Sherringham as upon any one else. He remained away 
to the last hour of his privilege and continued to act lucidly 
in having nothing to do with the mother and daughter for 
several days after his return to Paris. 

It was when this discipline came to an end, one afternoon 
after a week had passed, that he felt most the force of the 
reference that has just been made to Mrs. Rooth' s private 
reckonings. He found her at home alone, writing a letter 
under the lamp, and as soon as he came in she cried out that 
he was the very person to whom the letter was addressed. 
She could bear it no longer ; she had permitted herself to 
reproach him with his terrible silence to ask why he had 





quite forsaken them. It was an illustration of the way in 
which her visitor had come to regard her that he rather dis- 
believed than believed this description of the crumpled papers 
lying on the table. He was not sure even that he believed 
that Miriam had just goije out. He told her mother how 
busy he had been all the while he was away and how much 
time in particular he had had to give, in London, to seeing on 
her daughter's behalf the people connected with the theatres. 

" Ah, if you pity me, tell me that you've got her an engage- 
ment ! " Mrs. Rooth cried, clasping her hands. 

" I took a great deal of trouble ; I wrote ever so many 
notes, sought introductions, talked with people -such im- 
possible people some of them. In short I knocked at every 
door, I went into the question exhaustively." And he 
enumerated the things he had done, imparted some of the 
knowledge he had gathered. The difficulties were serious, 
and even with the influence he could command (such as it 
was) there was very little to be achieved in face of them. 
Still he had gained ground : there were two or three fellows, 
men with small theatres, who had listened to him better than 
the others, and there was one in particular whom he had a 
hope he might really have interested. From him he had 
extracted certain merciful assurances : he would see Miriam, 
he would listen to her, he would do for her what he could. 
The trouble was that no one would lift a finger for a girl 
unless she were known, and yet that she never could become 
known until innumerable fingers were lifted. You couldn't 
go into the water unless you could swim, and you couldn't 
swim until you had been in the water. 

" But new performers appear ; they get theatres, they get 
audiences, they get notices in the newspapers," Mrs. Rooth 
objected. " I know of these things only what Miriam tells 
me. It's no knowledge that I was born to." 

" It's perfectly true ; it's all done with money." 

"And how do they come by money?" Mrs. Rooth asked, 
candidly. 

"When they're women people give it to them." 

" Well, what people, now ? " 

" People who believe in them." 

"As you believe in Miriam  ?" 

Sherringham was silent a moment. " No, rather differently. 
A poor man doesn't believe anything in the same way that a 
rich man does." 

"Ah, don't call yourself poor ! " groaned Mrs. Rooth. 





" What good would it do me to be rich ? " 

" Why, you could take a theatre ; you could do it all 
yourself." 

" And what good would that do me  ? " 

"Why, don't you delight in her genius'?" demanded Mrs. 
Rooth. 

" I delight in her mother. You think me more disinterested 
than I am," Sherringham added, with a certain soreness of 
irritation. 

" I know why you didn't write ! " Mrs. Rooth declared, 
archly. 

"You must go to London," Peter said, without heeding 
this remark. 

" Ah, if we could only get there it would be a relief. I 
should draw a long breath. There at least I know where I 
am, and what people are. But here one lives on hollow 
ground ! " 

"The sooner you get away the better," Sherringham 
went on. 

"I know why you say that." 

"It's just what I'm explaining." 

"I couldn't have held out if I hadn't been so sure of 
Miriam," said Mrs. Rooth. 

"Well, you needn't hold out any longer." 

" Don't you trust her ? " asked Sherringham's hostess. 

"Trust her?" 

" You don't trust yourself. That's why you were silent, 
why we might have thought you were dead, why we might 
have perished ourselves." 

"I don't think I understand you; I don't know what 
you're talking about," Sherringham said. "But it doesn't 
matter." 

" Doesn't it ? Let yourself go : why should you struggle ? " 
the old woman inquired. 

Her unexpected insistence annoyed her visitor, and he was 
silent again, looking at her, on the point of telling her that 
he didn't like her tone. But he had his tongue under such 
control that he was able presently to say, instead of this 
and it was a relief for him to give audible voice to the 
reflection : " It's a great mistake, either way, for a man to 
be in love with an actress. Either it means nothing serious, 
and what's the use of that ? or it means everything, and that's 
still more delusive." 

" Delusive ? " 





''Idle, unprofitable." 

" Surely a pure affection is its own reward," Mrs. Rooth 
rejoined, with soft reasonableness. 

"In such a case how can it be pure ? " 

" I thought you were talking of an English gentleman," 
said Mrs. Rooth. 

"Call the poor fellow whatever you like : a man with his 
life to lead, his way to make, his work, his duties, his career 
to attend to. If it means nothing, as I say, the thing it 
means least of all is marriage." 

" Oh, my own Miriam ! " murmured Mrs. Rooth. 

" On the other hand fancy the complication if such a man 
marries a woman who's on the stage." 

Mrs. Rooth looked as if she were trying to follow. 
"Miriam isn't on the stage yet." 

" Go to London and she soon will be." 

" Yes, and then you'll have your excuse." 

" My excuse? " 

"For deserting us altogether." 

Sherringham broke into laughter at this, the tone was so 
droll. Then he rejoined : " Show me some good acting and I 
won't desert you." 

" Good acting ? Ah, what is the best acting compared 
with the position of an English lady ? If you'll take her as 
she is you may have her," Mrs. Rooth suddenly added. 

" As she is, with all her ambitions unassuaged ? " 

" To marry you might not that be an ambition ? " 

" A very paltry one. Don't answer for her, don't attempt 
that," said Sherringham. "You can do much better." 

" Do you think you can ? " smiled Mrs. Rooth. 

" I don't want to ; I only want to let it alone. She's an 
artist ; you must give her her head," Peter went on. " You 
must always give an artist his head." 

"But I have known great ladies who were artists. In 
English society there is always a field." 

" Don't talk to me of English society ! Thank heaven, in 
the first place, I don't live in it. Do you want her to give up 
her genius'? " 

" I thought you didn't care for it." 

" She'd say 'No, I thank you, dear mamma.' " 

"My gifted child ! " Mrs. Rooth murmured. 

" Have you ever proposed it to her ] " 

"Proposed it?" 

"That she should give up trying." 





Mrs. Rooth hesitated, looking down. " Not for the reason 
you mean. We don't talk about love," she simpered. 

" Then it's so much less time wasted. Don't stretch out 
your hand to the worse when it may some day grasp the 
better," Sherringham pursued. Mrs. Rooth raised her eyes 
at him as if she recognized the force there might be in that, 
and he added : " Let her blaze out, let her look about her. 
Then you may talk to me if you like." 

" It's very puzzling," the old woman remarked, artlessly. 

Sherringham laughed again ; then he said : " Now don't tell 
me I'm not a good friend." 

" You are indeed you're a very noble gentleman. That's 
just why a quiet life with you 

" It wouldn't be quiet for me ! " Sherringham broke in. 
"And that's not what Miriam was made for." 

" Don't say that, for my precious one ! " Mrs. Rooth 
quavered. 

" Go to London go to London," her visitor repeated. 

Thoughtfully, after an instant, she extended her hand and 
took from the table the letter on the composition of which he 
had found her engaged. Then with a quick movement she 
tore it up. ''That's what Mr. Dashwood says." 

"Mr. Dashwood?" 

" I forgot you don't know him. He's the brother of that 
lady we met the day you were so good as to receive us ; the 
one who was so kind to us Mrs. Lovick." 

"I never heard of him." 

"Don't you remember that she spoke of him and Mr. 
Lovick didn't seem very kind about him ? She told us that if 
he were to meet us and she was so good as to insinuate that 
it would be a pleasure to him to do so he might give us, as 
she said, a tip." 

Sherringham indulged in a visible effort to recollect. " Yes, 
he comes back to me. He's an actor." 

" He's a gentleman too," said Mrs. Rooth. 

" And you've met him and he has given you a tip ? " 

" As I say, he wants us to go to London." 

" I see, but even I can tell you that." 

" Oh, yes," said Mrs. Rooth ; " but he says he can help us." 

" Keep hold of him then r if he's in the business." 

" He's a perfect gentleman," said Mrs. Rooth. " He's 
immensely struck with Miriam." 

" Better and better. Keep hold of him." 

" Well, I'm glad you don't object," Mrs. Rooth smiled. 





"Why should I object?" 

" You don't consider us as all your own ? " 

" My own ? Why, I regard you as the public's the world's." 

Mrs. Rooth gave a little shudder. " There's a sort of chill 
in that. It's grand, but it's cold. However, I needn't hesitate 
then to tell you that it's with Mr. Dashwood that Miriam has 
gone out." 

" Why hesitate, gracious heaven ? " But in the next breath 
Sherringham asked : " Where has she gone ? " 

You don't like it ! " laughed Mrs. Rooth. 

" Why should it be a thing to be enthusiastic about ? " 

"Well, he's charming, and  trust him." 

"So do I," said Sherringham. 

" They've gone to see Madame Carre." 

" She has come back then ? " 

" She was expected back last week. Miriam wants to show 
her how she has improved." 

" And Juts she improved ? " 

"How can I tell with my mother's heart?" asked Mrs. 
Rooth. " I don't judge ; I only wait and pray. But Mr. 
Dashwood thinks she's wonderful." 

" That's a blessing. And when did he turn up? " 

" About a fortnight ago. We met Mrs. Lovick at the 
English church, and she was so good as to recognize us and 
speak to us. She said she had been away with her children, 
or she would have come to see us. She had just returned to 
Paris." 

" Yes, I've not yet seen her," said Sherringham. " I see 
Lovick, but he doesn't talk of his brother-in-law." 

"I didn't, that day, lik.e his tone about him," Mrs. Rooth 
observed. " We walked a little way with Mrs. Lovick and 
she asked Miriam about her prospects and if she were working. 
Miriam said she had no prospects." 

" That was not very nice to me," Sherringham interrupted. 

" But when you had left us in black darkness, where were 
our prospects?" 

" I see ; it's all right. Go on." 

' ' Then Mrs. Lovick said her brother was to be in Paris a 
few days and she would tell him to come and see us. He 
arrived, she told him and he came. Voila ! " said Mrs. Rooth. 

" So that now (so far as Tie is concerned) Miss Rooth has 
prospects ? " 

"He isn't a manager unfortunately." 

" Where does he act ? " 





" He isn't acting just now ; he has been abroad. He has 
been to Italy, I believe, and he is just stopping here on his 
way to London." 

" I see ; he is a perfect gentleman," said Sherringham. 

" Ah, you're jealous of him." 

" No, but you're trying to make me so. The more com- 
petitors there are for the glory of bringing her out, the better 
for her."
