act; moreover, he was always trying to escape. He 
had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first 
day of his return; he not only came forth empty- 
handed, but tried to rouse the housemates. He 
was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work; 
he would not work; moreover. He threatened the 
tinker with his own soldering-iron; ’and find both 

Hugo and the tinker found their hands full with the 
mere matter of keeping him from getting away. He 
delivered the thimders of his royalty upon the heads 
of all who hampered his liberties or tried to force 
him to service. He was sent out, in Hugo’s charge, 
in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased 
baby, to beg; but the result was not encouraging — 
he declined to plead for the mendicants, or be a 
party to their cause in any way. 

Thus several days went by and the miseries of 
this tramping life, and the weariness and sordidness 
and meanness and vulgarity of it, became gradually 
and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he 
began at last to feel that his release from the hermit’s 
knife must prove only a temporary respite from 
death, at best. 

But at night, in his dreams, these things were for- 
gotten, and he was on his throne, and master again. 
This, of course, intensified the sufferings of the 
awakening — so the mortifications of each succeed- 
ing morning of the few that passed between his re- 
turn to bondage and the combat with Hugo, grew 
bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to bear. 

The morning after that combat, Hugo got up with 
a heart filled with vengefid purposes against the 
king. He had two plans in particular. One was to 
inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud 
spirit and “imagined” royalty, a peculiar humilia- 
tion; and if he failed to accomplish this, his other 
plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the king 
and then betray him into the implacable clutches of 
the law. 


In pxirsuance of the first plan, he proposed to put 
a “clime” upon the king’s leg, rightly judging that 
that would mortify him to the last and perfect de- 
gree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he 
meant to get Canty’s help, and force the king to 
expose his leg in the highway and beg for alms. 
“Clime” was the cant term for a sore, artificially 
created. To make a clime, the operator made a 
paste or poultice of unslaked lime, soap, and the 
rust of old iron, and spread it upon a piece of leather, 
which was then bound tightly upon the leg. This 
would presently fret off the skin, and make the 
flesh raw and angry-looking; blood was then rubbed 
upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a 
dark and repulsive color. Then a bandage of soiled 
rags was put on in a cleverly careless way which 
would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen and move 
the compassion of the passer-by. 

Hugo got the help of the tinker whom the king 
had cowed with the soldering-iron; they took the 
boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon as they 
were out of sight of the camp they threw him down 
and the tinker held him while Hugo bound the 
poultice tight and fast upon his leg. 

The king raged and stormed, and promised to hang 
the two the moment the scepter was in his hand 
again; but they kept a firm grip upon him and en- 
joyed* his impotent struggling and jeered at his 
threats. This continued until the poultice began to 
bite; and in no long time its work would have been 
perfected, if there had been no interruption. But

there ws; for about this time the “slave” who had 
made the speech denouncing England’s laws, 
appeared on the scene and put an end to the enterprise, 
and stripped oflE the poultice and bandage. 

The king wanted to borrow his deliverer’s cudgel 
and warm the jackets of the two rascals on the spot; 
but the man said no, it would bring trouble — cleave 
the matter till night; the whole tribe being together, 
then, the outside world would not venture to
interfere or interrupt. He marched the party back to 
camp and reported the affair to the RufiSer, who 
listened, pondered, and then decided that the king 
should not be again detailed to beg, since it was 
plain he was worthy of something higher and better 
—wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the 
mendicant rank and appointed him to steal! 

Hugo was overjoyed. He had already tried to 
make the king steal, and failed; but there would be 
no more trouble of that sort now, for, of course, 
the king would not dream of defying a distinct com- 
mand delivered directly from headquarters. So he 
planned a raid for that very afternoon, purposing to 
get the king in the law’s grip in the course of it; 
and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that 
it should seem to be accidental and unintentional; 
for the King of the Game-Cocks was popular now, 
and the gang might not deal over-gently with an 
unpopular member who played so serious a treachery 
upon him as the delivering him over to the common 
enemy, the law. 

Very well. All in good time Hugo strolled off to 
a neighboring village with his prey; and the two 
drifted slowly up and down one street after another, 
the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve 
his evil purpose, and the other watching as sharply 
for a chance to dart away and get free of his 
infamous captivity forever. 

Both threw away some tolerably fair-looking 
opportunities; for both, in their secret hearts, were 
resolved to make absolutely sure work this time, and 
neither meant to allow Ms fevered desires to seduce 
him into any venture that had much uncertainty 
about it. 

Hugo’s chance came first. For at last a woman 
approached who carried a fat package of some sort 
in a basket. Hugo’s eyes sparkled with sinful 
pleasure as he said to himself, “Breath o’ my life, an 
I can but put that upon him, ’tis good-den and God 
keep thee, King of the Game-Cocks!” He waited 
and watched — outwardly patient, but inwardly 
consuming with excitement — till the woman had passed 
by, and the time was ripe; then said, in a low voice: 
“Tarry here till I come again,” and darted stealthily 
after the prey. 

The king’s heart was filled with joy — he could 
make his escape now, if Hugo’s quest only carried 
him far enough away. 

But he was to have no such luck. Hugo crept 
behind the woman, snatched the package, and came 
running back, wrapping it in an old piece of blanket 
which he carried on his arm. The hue and cry was 
raised in a moment by the woman, who knew her 
loss by the lightening' of her burden, although she 
had not seen the pilfering done. Hugo thrust the 
bundle into the king’s hands without halting, 
saying: 

“Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry 
‘Stop thief!’ but mind ye lead them astray!” 

The next moment Hugo turned a comer and 
darted down a crooked alley — and in another 
moment or two he lounged into view again, looking 
innocent and indifferent, and took up a position 
behind a post to watch restdts. 

The insulted king threw the btmdle on the ground; 
and the blanket fell away from it just as the woman 
arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her heels; she 
.seized the king’s wrist with one hand, snatched up 
her bundle with the other, and began to pour out a 
tirade of abuse upon the boy while he stmggled, 
without success, to free himself from her grip. 

Hugo had seen enough — his enemy was captured 
and the law would get him now — so he slipped 
away, jubilant and chuckhng, and wended camp- 
ward, framing a judicious version of the mat- 
ter to give to the RufSer’s crew as he strode 
along. 

The king continued to struggle in the woman’s 
grasp, and now and then cried out, in vexation: 

“Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I 
that bereaved thee of thy paltry goods.” 

The crowd closed around, threatening the king 
and calling him names; a brawny blacksmith in 
leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows, made 
a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, 
for a lesson; but just then a long sword flashed in 
the air and fell with convinciag force upon the man’s 

arm, flat-side down, the fantastic owner of it remark- 
ing, pleasantly at the same time: 

“Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not 
with ill blood and tmcharitable words. This is 
matter for the law’s consideration, not private and 
unofficial handling. Loose thy hold from the boy, 
goodwife.” 

The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with 
a glance, then went muttering away, rubbing his 
arm; the woman released the boy’s wrist reluc- 
tantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but 
pradently closed their mouths. The king sprang to 
his deliverer’s side, with flushed cheeks and spark- 
ling eyes, exclaiming: 

“Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in 
good season now. Sir Miles; carve me this rabble to 
ral” 


THE PRINCE A PRISONER 

Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down 
and wbispered in the king’s ear: 

“Softly, softly my prince, wag thy tongue warily 
— nay, suffer it not to wag at all. Trust in me — 
all shall go well in the end.” Then he added, to 
himself: “Sit Miles! Bless me, I had totally for- 
got I was a knight! Lord how marvelous a thing it 
is, the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint 
and crazy fancies! ... An empty and foolish title 
is mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it, 
for I think it is more honor to be held worthy to be 
a specter-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and 
Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl 
in some of the real kingdoms of this world.” 

The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who 
approached and was about to lay his hand upon the 
king’s shoulder, when Hendon said: 

“Gently, good friend, withhold your hand — he 
shall go peaceably; I am responsible for that. Lead 
on, we will follow.” 

The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; 
Miles and the king followed after, with the crowd at 
their heels. The king was indined to rebel; but 
Hendon said to him in a low voice: 

“Reflect, sire — your laws are the wholesome 
breath of your own royalty; shall their source resist 
them, yet require the branches to respect them? 
Apparently, one of these laws has been broken; 
when the king is on his throne again, can it ever 
grieve him to remember that when he was seemingly 
a private person he loyally sunk the king in the 
citizen and submitted to its authority?” 

“Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see 
that whatsoever the king of England requires a 
subject to suffer under the law, he will himself suffer 
while he holdeth the station of a subject,” 

When the woman was called upon to testify before 
the justice of the peace, she swore that the small 
prisoner at the bar was the person who had 
committed the theft; there was none able to show the 
contrary, so the king stood convicted. The bundle 
was now unrolled, and when the contents proved to 
be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked 
troubled, while Hendon turned pale, and his body 
was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay; but 
the king remained unmoved, protected by his ignorance.
The judge meditated, dtrring an ominous 
pause, then turned to the woman, with the question: 

“What dost thou hold this property to be worth?” 

The woman courtesied and replied: 

“Three shillings and eightpence, your worship — 
I could not abate a penny and set forth the value 
honestly.” 

The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon 
the crowd, then nodded to the constable and said: 

“Clear the court and close the doors.” 
 

It was done. None remained but the two officials, 
the accused, the accuser, and Miles Hendon. This 
latter was rigid and colorless, and on his forehead 
big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended 
together, and triclded down his face. The judge 
turned to the woman again, and said, in a compas'' 
sionate voice: 

“’Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven 
hard by hunger, for these be grievous times for the 
unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an evil face — 
but when htmger driveth — Good woman! dost 
know that when one steals a thing above the value 
of thirteen pence ha’penny the law saith he shall 
hang for it?” 

The little king started, wide-eyed with consternation,
but controlled himself and held his peace; but 
not so the woman. She sprang to her feet, shaking 
with fright, and cried out: 

“Oh, good lack, what have I done! God-a-mercy, 
I would not hang the poor thing for the 
whole world! Ah, save me from this, your worship — 
what shall I do, what can I do?” 

The justice maintained his judicial composure, and 
simply said: 

“Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, 
since it is not yet writ upon the record.” 

“Then in God’s name call the pig eightpence, and 
heaven bless the day that freed my conscience of 
this awesome thing!” 

Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; 
and surprised the king and wounded his dignity by 
throwing his arms around him and hugging him. 

The woman made her grateftJ adieux and started 
away with her pig; and when the constable opened 
the door for her, he followed her out into the narrow 
hall. The justice proceeded to write in his record- 
book. Hendon, always alert, thought he would 
like to know why the officer followed the woman out; 
so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened. 
He heard a conversation to this effect: 

“It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will 
buy it of thee; here is the eightpence.” 

“Eightpence, indeed! Thou’lt do no such thing. 
It cost me three shillings and eightpence, good 
honest coin of the last reign, that old Harry that’s 
just dead ne’er touched nor tampered with, A fig 
for thy eightpence!” 

“Stands the wind in that quarter? Thou wast 
under oath, and so swore falsely when thou saidst 
the value was but eightpence. Come straightway 
back with me before his worship, and answer for the 
crime! — and then the lad will hang.” 

“There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am 
content. Give me the eightpence, and hold thy 
peace about the matter.” 

The woman went off crying; Hendon slipped back 
into the court-room, and the constable presently 
followed, after hiding his prize in some convenient 
place. The justice wrote a while longer, then read 
the king a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced 
him to a short imprisonment in the common jail, to 
be followed by a public flogging. The astounded 
king opened his mouth and was probably going to 
order: the good judge to be beheaded on the spot; 

but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and 
succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost 
anything out of it. Hendon took him by the hand, 
now made reverence to the justice, and the two 
departed in the wake of the constable toward the 
jail. The moment the street was reached, the 
inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his hand, and 
exclaimed: 

“Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail 
alive.

Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply: 

‘Will you trust in me? Peace! and forbear to 
worsen our chances with dangerous speedi. What 
God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it, 
thou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be 
patient — 'twill be time enow to rail or rejoice when 
what is to happen has happened.” 

THE ESCAPE 

The short winter day was nearly ended. The 
streets were deserted, save for a few random 
Stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the 
intent look of people who were only anxious to 
accomplish their errands as quickly as possible and 
then snugly house themselves from the rising wind 
and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to 
the right nor to the left; they paid no attention to 
our party, they did not even seem to see them. 
Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectade of a 
king on his way to jail had ever encountered such 
naaxvelous indifference before. By and by the 
constable arrived at a deserted market-square and pro- 
ceeded to cross it. When he had reached the middle 
of it, Hendon laid his hand upon his arm, and said 
in a low voice; 

“Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, 
and I would say a word to thee.” 

“My duty forbids it, sir; prithee, hinder me not, 
the night comes on.” 

“Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee 
nearly. Turn thy back a moment and seem not to 
see; let this poor lad escape” 

“This to me, sir! I arrest thee in — ” 

“Nay, be not too basty. See thou be careful 
and commit no foolish error” — then he shut his voice 
down, to a whisper, and said in the man’s ear — 
“the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may 
cost thee thy neck, man!” 

The poor constable, taken by surprise, was speech- 
less at first, then found his tongue and fell to bluster- 
ing and threatening; but Hendon was tranquil, and 
waited with patience till his breath was spent; then 
said: 

“I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not 
willingly see thee come to harm. Observe, I heard 
it all — every word. I will prove it to thee.” Then 
he repeated the conversation which the officer and 
the woman had had together in the hall, word for 
word, and ended with: 

“There — have I set it forth correctly? Should 
not I be able to set it forth correctly before the 
judge, if occasion required?” 

The man was dumb with fear and distress for 
a moment; then he rallied and said with forced 
lightness: 

‘ ‘ ’Tis making a mighty matter indeed, out of a jest ; 
I but plagued the woman for mine amusement.” 

“Kept you the woman’s pig for amusement?” 

The man answered sharply: 

“Naught else, good sir — I teH thee ’twas but a jest.” 

“I do begin to believe thee,” said Hendon, with 
a perplexing mixture of mockery and half-con'viction 
in his tone; “but tarry thou here a moment whilst I 
run and ask his worship — for nathless, he being a 
man experienced in law, in jests, in — ” 

He was moving away, still talking; ilae constable 
hesitated, fidgeted, spat out an oath or two, then 
cried out: 

“Hold, hold, good sir — prithee, wait a little— 
the judge! why man, he hath no more sympathy 
with a jest than hath a dead coipse! — come, and 
W'e will speak further, Ods body! I seem to be in 
evil case — and all for an innocent and thoughtless 
pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my wife 
and little ones — List to reason, good yotur wor- 
ship; what wouldst thou of me?” 

“Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic 
whilst one may count a hundred thousand — count- 
ing slowly,” said Hendon, with the expression of a 
man who asks but a reasonable favor, and that a 
very little one, 

“It is my destruction!” said the constable de- 
spairingly, “Ah, be reasonable, good sir; only 
look at this matter, on all its sides, and see how 
mere a jest it is — how manifestly and how plainly 
it is so. And even if one granted it were not a jest, 
it is a fault so small that e’en the grimmest penalty 
it could call forth would be but a rebuke and 
warning from the judge’s lips.” 

Hendon relied with a solemnity which chilled 
the air about him: 

“This jest of thine hath a name in law — wot you 
what it is?” 

“I knew it not! Peradventure I have been unwise.
I never dreamed it had a name — ah, sweet 
heaven, I thought it was original.” 

“Yes, it hath a name. In the law this crime is 
called Non compos mentis lex talionis sic transit 
gloria Mundi.” 

“Ah, my God!”
