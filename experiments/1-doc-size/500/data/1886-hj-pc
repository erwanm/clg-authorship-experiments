barren. He was sure the singular creature before him 
would never have had a chance to take the unprecedented 
social step for the sake of which she was ready to go forth 
from Belgrave Square for ever ; Hyacinth had judged the 
smallness of Paul Muniment's appetite for that complication 
sufficiently to have begun really to pity her ladyship long 
ago. And now, even when he most felt the sweetness of 
her sympathy, he might wonder what she could have im- 
agined for him in the event of his not having been sup- 
planted what security, what completer promotion, what 
honourable, satisfying sequel. They were unhappy because 



i?2   XLII 

they were unhappy, and they were right not to rail about 
that. 

' Oh, I like to see you I like to talk with you,' said 
Lady Aurora, simply. They talked for a quarter of an 
hour, and he made her such a visit as any gentleman might 
have made to any lady. They exchanged remarks about 
the lateness of the spring, about the loan -exhibition at 
Burlington House which Hyacinth had paid his shilling 
to see about the question of opening the museums on 
Sunday, about the danger of too much coddling legislation 
on behalf of the working classes. He declared that it gave 
him great pleasure to see any sign of her amusing herself; 
it was unnatural never to do that, and he hoped that now 
she had taken a turn she would keep it up. At this she 
looked down, smiling, at her frugal finery, and then she 
replied, ' I dare say I shall begin to go to balls who 
knows ? ' 

'That's what our friends in Audley Court think, you 
know that it's the worst mistake you can make, not to 
drink deep of the cup while you have it.' 

' Oh, I'll do it, then I'll do it for them ! ' Lady Aurora 
exclaimed. ' I dare say that, as regards all that, I haven't 
listened to them enough.' This was the only allusion that 
passed on the subject of the Muniments. 

Hyacinth got up he had stayed long enough, as she 
was going out ; and as he held out his hand to her she 
seemed to him a heroine. She would try to cultivate the 
pleasures of her class if the brother and sister in Camber- 
well thought it right try even to be a woman of fashion in 
order to console herself. Paul Muniment didn't care for 
her, but she was capable of considering that it might be her 



 

duty to regulate her life by the very advice that made an 
abyss between them. Hyacinth didn't believe in the suc- 
cess of this attempt ; there passed before his imagination a 
picture of the poor lady coming home and pulling off her 
feathers for ever, after an evening spent in watching the 
agitation of a ball-room from the outer edge of the circle, 
with a white, irresponsive face. ' Let us eat and drink, for 
to-morrow we die,' he said, laughing. 

' Oh, I don't mind dying.' 

' I think I do,' Hyacinth declared, as he turned away. 
There had been no mention whatever of the Princess. 

It was early enough in the evening for him to risk a 
visit to Lisson Grove ; he calculated that the Poupins would 
still be sitting up. When he reached their house he found 
this calculation justified ; the brilliancy of the light in the 
window appeared to announce that Madame was holding a 
salon. He ascended to this apartment without delay (it 
was free to a visitor to open the house-door himself), and, 
having knocked, obeyed the hostess's invitation to enter. 
Poupin and his wife were seated, with a third person, at a 
table in the middle of the room, round a staring kerosene 
lamp adorned with a globe of clear glass, of which the 
transparency was mitigated only by a circular pattern of 
bunches of grapes. The third person was his friend 
Schinkel, who had been a member of the little party that 
waited upon Hoffendahl. No one said anything as Hya- 
cinth came in \ but in their silence the three others got 
up, looking at him, as he thought, rather strangely. 




XLIII 

' MY child, you are always welcome,' said Eustache Poupin, 
taking Hyacinth's hand in both his own and holding it for 
some moments. An impression had come to our young 
man, immediately, that they were talking about him before 
he appeared and that they would rather have been left to 
talk at their ease. He even thought he saw in Poupin's 
face the kind of consciousness that comes from detection, 
or at least interruption, in a nefarious act. With Poupin, 
however, it was difficult to tell ; he always looked so heated 
and exalted, so like a conspirator defying the approach of 
justice. Hyacinth contemplated the others : they were 
standing as if they had shuffled something on the table out 
of sight, as if they had been engaged in the manufacture of 
counterfeit coin. Poupin kept hold of his hand ; the 
Frenchman's ardent eyes, fixed, unwinking, always expres- 
sive of the greatness of the occasion, whatever the occasion 
was, had never seemed to him to protrude so far from his 
head. ' Ah, my dear friend, nous causions justement de vous] 
Eustache remarked, as if this were a very extraordinary fact. 
'Oh, nous causions nous causions ' his wife exclaimed, 
as if to deprecate an indiscreet exaggeration. ' One may 
mention a friend, I suppose, in the way of conversation, 
without taking such a liberty.' 



'A cat may look at a king, as your English proverb 
says,' added Schinkel, jocosely. He smiled so hard at his 
own pleasantry that his eyes closed up and vanished an 
effect which Hyacinth, who had observed it before, thought 
particularly unbecoming to him, appearing as it did to ad- 
minister the last perfection to his ugliness. He would have 
consulted his interests by cultivating immobility of feature. 
' Oh, a king, a king ! ' murmured Poupin, shaking his 
head up and down. ' That's what it's not good to be, au 
point ou nous en sommes.' 

' I just came in to wish you good-night,' said Hyacinth. 
'I'm afraid it's rather late for a call, though Schinkel is 
here.' 

' It's always too late, my very dear, when you come,' the 
Frenchman rejoined. ' You know if you have a place at 
our fireside.' 

' I esteem it too much to disturb it,' said Hyacinth, 
smiling and looking round at the three. 

' We can easily sit down again ; we are a comfortable 
party. Put yourself beside me.' And the Frenchman 
drew a chair close to the one, at the table, that he had just 
quitted. 

' He has had a long walk, he is tired he will certainly 
accept a little glass,' Madame Poupin announced with de- 
cision, moving toward the tray containing the small gilded 
liqueur service. 

'We will each accept one, ma bonne; it is a very good occa- 
sion for a dropoffr ,' her husband interposed, while Hyacinth 
seated himself in the chair his host had designated. Schinkel 
resumed his place, which was opposite ; he looked across at 
Hyacinth without speaking, but his long face continued to 



 

flatten itself into a representation of mirth. He had on a 
green coat, which Hyacinth had seen before ; it was a gar- 
ment of ceremony, such as our young man judged it would 
have been impossible to procure in London or in any 
modern time. It was eminently German and of high anti- 
quity, and had a tall, stiff, clumsy collar, which came up to 
the wearer's ears and almost concealed his perpetual band- 
age. When Hyacinth had sat down Eustache Poupin did 
not take possession of his own chair, but stood beside him, 
resting his hand on his head. At that touch something 
came over Hyacinth, and his heart sprang into his throat. 
The idea that occurred to him, conveyed in Poupin's whole 
manner as well as in the reassuring intention of that caress 
and in his wife's uneasy, instant offer of refreshment, 
explained the embarrassment of the circle and reminded our 
young man of the engagement he had taken with himself to 
exhibit an extraordinary quietness when a certain crisis in 
his life should have arrived. It seemed to him that this 
crisis was in the air, very near that he should touch it if 
he made another movement ; the pressure of the French- 
man's hand, which was meant as a solvent, only operated as 
a warning. As he looked across at Schinkel he felt dizzy 
and a little sick; for a moment, to his senses, the room 
whirled round. His resolution to be quiet appeared only 
too easy to keep ; he couldn't break it even to the extent of 
speaking. He knew that his voice would tremble, and that 
is why he made no answer to Schinkel's rather honeyed 
words, uttered after an hesitation. ' Also, my dear Robin- 
son, have you passed your Sunday well have you had an 
'appy day?' Why was every one so endearing? His eyes 
questioned the table, but encountered nothing but its well- 



wiped surface, polished for so many years by the gustatory 
elbows of the Frenchman and his wife, and the lady's dirty 
pack of cards for ' patience ' (she had apparently been 
engaged in this exercise when Schinkel came in), which in- 
deed gave a little the impression of gamblers surprised, who 
might have shuffled away the stakes. Madame Poupin, 
who had dived into a cupboard, came back with a bottle of 
green chartreuse, an apparition which led the German to ex- 
claim, ' Lieber Gott, you Vrench, you Vrench, how well you 
manage ! What would you have more?' 

The hostess distributed the liquor, but Hyacinth was 
scarcely able to swallow it, though it was highly appre- 
ciated by his companions. His indifference to this luxury 
excited much discussion and conjecture, the others bandy- 
ing theories and contradictions, and even ineffectual jokes, 
about him, over his head, with a volubility which seemed to 
him unnatural. Poupin and Schinkel professed the belief 
that there must be something very curious the matter with a 
man who couldn't smack his lips over a drop of that tap ; he 
must either be in love or have some still more insidious 
complaint. It was true that Hyacinth was always in love 
that was no secret to his friends and it had never been 
observed to stop his thirst. The Frenchwoman poured 
scorn on this view of the case, declaring that the effect 
of the tender passion was to make one enjoy one's victual 
(when everything went straight, bien entendu; and how could 
an ear be deaf to the whisperings of such a dear little bon- 
homme as Hyacinth ?) in proof of which she deposed that 
she had never eaten and drunk with such relish as at the 
time oh, it was far away now when she had a soft spot 
in her heart for her rascal of a husband. For Madame 



 

Poupin to allude to her husband as a rascal indicated a high 
degree of conviviality. Hyacinth sat staring at the empty 
table with the feeling that he . was, somehow, a detached, 
irresponsible witness of the evolution of his fate. Finally 
he looked up and said to his friends, collectively, ' What on 
earth's the matter with you all?' And he followed this 
inquiry by an invitation that they should tell him what it was 
they had been saying about him, since they admitted 
that he had been the subject of their conversation. Madame 
Poupin answered for them that they had simply been saying 
how much they loved him, but that they wouldn't love him 
any more if he became suspicious and grincheux. She had 
been telling Mr Schinkel's fortune on the cards, and she 
would tell Hyacinth's if he liked. There was nothing much 
for Mr Schinkel, only that he would find something, some 
day, that he had lost, but would probably lose it again, and 
serve him right if he did ! He objected that he had never 
had anything to lose, and never expected to have ; but that 
was a vain remark, inasmuch as the time was fast coming 
when every one would have something though indeed it 
was to be hoped that he would keep it when he had got it. 
Eustache rebuked his wife for her levity, reminded her that 
their young friend cared nothing for old women's tricks, and 
said he was sure Hyacinth had come to talk over a very 
different matter the question (he was so good as to take 
an interest in it, as he had done in everything that related 
to them), of the terms which M. Poupin might owe it to him- 
self, to his dignity, to a just though not exaggerated senti- 
ment of his value, to make in accepting Mr Crookenden's 
offer of the foremanship of the establishment in Soho ; an 
offer not yet formally enunciated but visibly in the air and 





destined it would seem, at least to arrive within a day or 
two. The old foreman was going to set up for himself. 
The Frenchman intimated that before accepting any such 
proposal he must have the most substantial guarantees. 
' me faudrait des conditions tres-particulieres? It was- 
singular to Hyacinth to hear M. Poupin talk so comfortably 
about these high contingencies, the chasm by which he 
himself was divided from the future having suddenly 
doubled its width. His host and hostess sat down on either 
side of him, and Poupin gave a sketch, in somewhat sombre 
tints, of the situation in Soho, enumerating certain elements 
of decomposition which he perceived to be at work there 
and which he would not undertake to deal with unless he 
should be given a completely free hand. Did Schinkel 
understand, and was that what Schinkel was grinning at ? 
Did Schinkel understand that poor Eustache was the 
victim of an absurd hallucination and that there was not 
the smallest chance of his being invited to assume a 
lieutenancy ? He had less capacity for tackling the British 
workman to-day than when he began to rub shoulders with 
him, and Mr. Crookenden had never in his life made a 
mistake, at least in the use of his tools. Hyacinth's responses 
were few and mechanical, and he presently ceased to try to 
look as if he were entering into the Frenchman's ideas. 

'You have some news you have some news about me,' 
he remarked, abruptly, to Schinkel. 'You don't like it, 
you don't like to have to give it to me, and you came 
to ask our friends here whether they wouldn't help you out 
ith it. But I don't think they will assist you particularly, 
poor dears ! Why do you mind ? You oughtn't to mind 
more than I do. That isn't the way.' 



 

' Qrfest-ce qu'il dit qiiest-ce qiiil dit, le pauvre cheril ' 
Madame Poupin demanded, eagerly ; while Schinkel looked 
very hard at her husband, as if to ask for direction. 

' My dear child, vous vousfaites des ideesf the latter ex- 
claimed, laying his hand on him remonstrantly. 

But Hyacinth pushed away his chair and got up. ' If 
you have anything to tell me, it is cruel of you to let me see 
it, as you have done, and yet not satisfy me.' 

' Why should' I have anything to tell you ? ' Schinkel 
asked. 

' I don't know that, but I believe you have. I perceive 
things, I guess things, quickly. That's my nature at all 
times, and I do it much more now.' 

' You do it indeed ; it is very wonderful,' said Schinkel. 

' Mr. Schinkel, will you do me the pleasure to go away 
I don't care where out of this house?' Madame Poupin 
broke out, in French. 

' Yes, that will be the best thing, and I will go with you 
said Hyacinth. 

' If you would retire, my child, I think it would be a 
service that you would render us,' Poupin returned, ap- 
pealing to his young friend. ' Won't you do us the justice 
to believe that you may leave your interests in our hands?' 

Hyacinth hesitated a moment; it was now perfectly 
clear to him that Schinkel had some sort of message for 
him, and his curiosity as to what it might be had become 
nearly intolerable. ' I am surprised at your weakness,' he 
observed, as sternly as he could manage it, to Poupin. 

The Frenchman stared at him an instant, and then fell 
on his neck. ' You are sublime, my young friend you 
are sublime !' 




' Will you be so good as to tell me what you are going 
to do with that young man?' demanded Madame Poupin, 
glaring at Schinkel. 

' It's none of your business, my poor lady,' Hyacinth 
replied, disengaging himself from her husband. ' Schinkel, 
I wish you would walk away with me.' 

' Calmons-nous, entendons-nous  expliquons-nous ! The 
situation is very simple Poupin went on. 

' I will go with you, if it will give you pleasure,' said 
Schinkel, very obligingly, to Hyacinth. 

'Then you will give me that letter first!' Madame 
Poupin, erecting herself, declared to the German. 

'My wife, you are an imbecile!' Poupin groaned, 
lifting his hands and shoulders and turning away. 

' I may be an imbecile, but I won't be a party no, 
God help me, not to that ! ' protested the Frenchwoman, 
planted before Schinkel as if to prevent his moving. 

' If you have a letter for me, you ought to give it to 
me,' said Hyacinth to Schinkel. ' You have no right to 
give it to any one else.' 

' I will bring it to you in your house, my good friend,' 
Schinkel replied, with a little wink that seemed to say that 
Madame Poupin would have to be considered. 

' Oh, in his house I'll go to his house !' cried the lady. 
' I regard you, I have always regarded you, as my child,' 
she declared to Hyacinth, 'and if this isn't an occasion 
for a mother !' 

' It's you that are making it an occasion. I don't know 
what you are talking about,' said Hyacinth. He had been 
questioning Schinkel's eye, and he thought ]je saw there 
a little twinkle of assurance that he might really depend 



 

upon him. ' I have disturbed you, and I think I had 
better go away.' 

Poupin had turned round again ; he seized the young 
man's arm eagerly, as if to prevent his retiring before he 
had given a certain satisfaction. ' How can you care, 
when you know everything is changed?' 

'What do you mean everything is changed?' 

'Your opinions, your sympathies, your whole attitude. 
I don't approve of it -je le constate. You have withdrawn 
your confidence from the people ; you have said things in 
this spot, where you stand now, that have given pain to my 
wife and me.' 

' If we didn't love you, we should say that you had 
betrayed us !' cried Madame Poupin, quickly, taking her 
husband's idea. 

' Oh, I shall never betray you,' said Hyacinth, 
smiling. 

'You will never betray us of course you think so. 
But you have no right to act for the people when you have 
ceased to believe in the people. II faut etre consequent, 
nom de Dieu ! ' Poupin went on. 

' You will give up all thoughts of acting for meje ne 
permets pas fa  ' exclaimed his wife. 

' It is probably not of importance only a little fraternal 
greeting,' Schinkel suggested, soothingly. 

' We repudiate you, we deny you, we denounce you ! ' 
shouted Poupin, more and more excited. 

' My poor friends, it is you who have broken down, not 
I,' said Hyacinth. ' I am much obliged to you for your 
solicitude, but the inconsequence is yours. At all events, 
good-night.' 



He turned away from them, and was leaving the room, 
when Madame Poupin threw herself upon him, as her 
husband had done a moment before, but in silence and 
with an extraordinary force of passion and distress. Being 
stout and powerful she quickly got the better of him, and 
pressed him to her ample bosom in a long, dumb embrace. 

' I don't know what you want me to do,' said Hyacinth, 
as soon as he could speak. ' It's for me to judge of my 
convictions.' 

'We want you to do nothing, because we know you 
have changed,' Poupin replied. ' Doesn't it stick out of 
you, in every glance of your eye and every breath of 
your lips? It's only for that, because that alters every- 
thing.' 

' Does it alter my engagement ? There are some things 
in which one can't change. I didn't promise to believe ; 
I promised to obey.' 

' We want you to be sincere that is the great thing,' 
said Poupin, edifyingly. 'I will go to see them I will 
make them understand.' 

' Ah, you should have done that before ! ' Madame 
Poupin groaned. 

' I don't know whom you are talking about, but I will 
allow no one to meddle in my affairs.' Hyacinth spoke 
with sudden vehemence ; the scene was cruel to his nerves, 
which were not in a condition to bear it. 

'When it is Hoffendahl, it is no good to meddle,' 
Schinkel remarked, smiling. 

' And pray, who is Hoffendahl, and what authority has 
he got?' demanded Madame Poupin, who had caught his 
meaning. ' Who has put him over us all, and is there 



 

nothing to do but to lie down in the dust before him? 
Let him attend to his little affairs himself, and not put 
them off on innocent children, no matter whether they are 
with us or against us.' 

This protest went so far that, evidently, Poupin felt a 
little ashamed of his wife. ' He has no authority but what 
we give him ; but you know that we respect him, that he 
is one of the pure, ma bonne. Hyacinth can do exactly as 
he likes; he knows that as well as we do. He knows 
there is not a feather's weight of compulsion ; he knows 
that, for my part, I long since ceased to expect anything 
from him.' 

'Certainly, there is no compulsion,' said Schinkel. 
' It's to take or to leave. Only they keep the books.'
