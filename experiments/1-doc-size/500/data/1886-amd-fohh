"Nothing, my darling; at least, nothing that you can 
help." 

" Is the pain so severe ? " 

It was not simply physical pain. The mental dis- 
quietude she cannot share. And he wants to think. 

" Doris," he says, with a kind of desperate quiet, '' will 
you go in the other room and play softly ? You have exor- 
cised the demon that way sometimes, you know. Play 
the ' Appassionata.' " 

She bends over and touches her soft fragant lips to his, 
and goes without a word. She has this quaint, childlike 
habit of obedience, that is so restful in a weak state. 
He listens soothed, and still thinks ; prays that death may 
not come until he has done full justice to this sweet wife. 

There follow several days of great prostratioti ; then 
he rallies, and they drive out again in the shining, laughter- 
freighted air. There is quite a colony of English and 
American residents, and though he does not know any of 
them, he can surely find a notary and explain the business 
he wants done in the most perfect legal manner. All the 
particulars and date of the marriage are arranged in a 
memorandum for use. 



 



 



 

for Lloyd Wentworth realizes that he has grown weaker 
than he was three months ago. The long drives of that 
time would tire him fearfully. They go a little. They 
bring home such violets and orange-blossoms as are hardly 
dreamed of, and they visit the curious and beautiful 
libraries and museum. But it is Doris now who talks. 
If she notices that he has grown silent, she makes no 
remark upon it, but seems to think of all the little things 
that may please and distract. 

One day she comes to him timidly with a letter in her 
hand. 

"It is from Aunt Gilbert," she explains, with rising 
color. "Uncle is going to Paris, and perhaps over to 
London, on business, and aunt will be left alone. Do you 
not think — ought I not — " 

"Invite her here," he adds, quickly, — "yes." Has 
not even she been maligned? lie can never forget how 
kind she was to him, a perfect stranger. 

" We have hardly done our duty toward your aunt," he 
says, regretfully. 

" Oh ! I do not think she has cared exactly, and it has 
been so delightful to be alone with you. And a dear 
friend of hers, Countess Dessayes, has been entertaining 
her all winter with balls and dinners. We have been so 
quiet, you know." 

" My poor little girl, you have no balls or parties or 
theatres, and only a few operas to solace yourself with." 
He glances at her sorrowfully. All the time when she 
should be gay and glad with youth and amusement will be 
devoted to care and sorrow. Can money make amends? 
" But I have had you and so many other things," with 
a quick, bright blush ; " so many pleasures. And I don't 
believe aunt has missed me at all. But now — shall I 
write to-day?" 

" As soon as you can " 

Lloyd Wentworth is extremely glad a few days later 



 



 



 

that the invitation has gone. A celebrated English sur- 
geon comes to. Naples for a fortnight of recuperation, and 
Wentworth, through the intervention of a friend, has an 
interview with him. It is as he has known all along, but 
quite forgotten in these happy months, — he is coming 
nearer the end, which may be sudden, for his disease has 
worn him out. 

Now and then he arranges his papers, writes a little, and 
plans as he desires everything to be done. Mrs. Gilbert 
comes, and is really glad to reach a haven of rest. Her 
countess has been very exacting, demanding devotion and 
interest day and night, and tiring of her at last, although 
Mrs. Gilbert has managed to extract much pleasure for 
herself, and made some friends. She is looking rather 
worn, not as calm and exultant as when they parted at 
Venice. 

She soon slips into the routine ; indeed, she relieves 
Doris in many ways ; and both find the new element a 
pleasant break in the strain they were enduring uncon- 
sciously. It is indeed a curious life for Doris. In the 
early months of their marriage, he had not hesitated to 
refer to the brief span of life that he knew must be his ; 
now he never even suggests the possibility. True, it is 
rarely out of his mind; he counts his days like golden 
grains. 

There are many fluctuations. Sometimes for days he 
lies quiet on the luxurious couch rolled over to the win- 
dows. He seems less sensitive to the noises ; he even 
delights at times in the wandering minstrelsy. Once in 
a while they drive out, and he takes an occasional walk in 
the garden. He could not well be thinner, but his brown 
eyes keep their lovely limpidness. She reads to him a 
great deal out of her little worn ^prayer-book, and she is 
never out of his sight any more. It is a tender, unreason- 
ing love. She married him gladly because he needed her, 
and she is wholly satisfied. 



 



 



CHAPTER VI. 

ACROSS THE OOBAN. 

'' Come, Doris." 

Doris Wentworth has been standing by the window 
drinking in for the last time the fragrance and beauty of 
the morning. The fields glow in their brilliant green, the 
olives and vineyards cluster thick upon each other, and the 
profusion of flowers is prodigal. The bay is blue, with 
golden tints and flecks, and the white sails seem like 
flocks of strange birds. 

" Come, Doris," with a little impatience. Mrs. Gilbert 
takes her arm gently, and leads her through the vestibule, 
tiled with wonderful mosaics. The nurse and Martin have 
gone on before, and Doris follows now without a word. 
As she walks down the path, she gathers a handful of 
blood-red roses. He loved them so. Alas ! that all of 
life with him should be in the past tense. Yet it is not 
saying good by to him, but rather going to him. 

Mrs. Gilbert is most important. She has the care of 
getting the party safely to Marseilles, where Mr. Gilbert 
will meet them and escort them to America. Doris and 
her baby are to go at once to Westwater ; Mrs. Gilbert is 
quite tired of foreign life, and the prospect of a home in 
her own land looks very inviting. But there is a great 
deal on her shoulders, and she enjoys it. 

They are settled in the carriage. "Are you comfort- 
able ? " Mrs. Gilbert asks ; " is the baby asleep, Brunetta ? " 

Then she arranges her veil, opens and shuts her reticule, 
and fidgets very gently with the responsibility. 

They go by water ; Doris is on deck, and strains her 
eyes to catch a last glimpse of the bay, and the glowing, 



 



 



 

wonderful city by the sea. And at last it all fades ; lier 
old life is a dream of foreign cities, a beautiful bewilder- 
ing remembrance. 

Death has come very gently. It has been simply falling 
asleep. In Lloyd Wentworth's desk were explicit instruc- 
tions. His body was to be taken at once to America, but 
Doris was to remain for the birth of her child. There is 
a long letter also for her, written at intervals, and contain- 
ing much that it would have been bitter to talk over, but 
it is sweet now to read. It seems almost as if it had been 
written from that far country. 

Her baby is a fine healthy boy, and has been christened 
Lloyd Basil. There is also a letter to Basil, which is con- 
signed to the care of Doris. In those last weeks he had a 
tender yearning for his kindred, and saw more clearly as 
the heavens were opened before him. 

Mr. Gilbert has attended to the last wishes of his 
niece's husband, and left him in the beautiful family 
burying-ground in an old aristocratic town. He has been 
decorously met by the relatives and treated with distant 
courtesy ; and after the sad rites were ended, he hastens 
back, filled with a new sense of admiration and importance 
for Doris and her child ; for surely fate could not be sf> 
cruel as to let any disappointment befall it. 

Nothing does interfere with its well-being or the com- 
fort of Doris. For a day or two she is a little seasick, 
but she proves herself a good sailor. They reach New 
York in safety, and it looks more foreign to her than the 
cities of the Old World. In all the talks of Westwater 
between herself and her husband, though he has said 
frequently, " I should like to show you such a view " ; or, 
" I should like you to see such a picture or such a room," 
he never has proposed to take her. She was too happy to 
remark it then ; she knows now why it was done. In one 
sense, there is not the disappointment; indeed, though 
every day Doris realized her loss more keenly, yet hope 



 



 



 

and anticipation, the joy of youth, have never existed ; con- 
sequently there is no overwhelming despair. In his last 
letter he has stated the case very fairly ; he had taken one 
delightful year of her life, he had added a burden per- 
haps in their child, but it had been planned from the 
beginning. Nothing could have lengthened his life. 

So she is going to his home as a duty. It belongs to 
his son, who is to be reared there to take his father's 
place ; and she seems to stand in the same light to the 
father as she does to the child. She has been given to 
them to care for and watch over them, to devote her life 
to them while they are with her. That either were given 
for her pleasure she does not yet comprehend, for she 
never thinks purely of herself. 

It is midsummer, and they do not care to remain in 
the city, strange as it seems, unless, indeed, Mrs. Gilbert 
does, whose feelings are like the return of any exile. 
It is nine years since she has seen it; and though 
changed in some places, there are familiar haunts and 
stores and hotels. Still, for the baby's sake, it is not 
well to linger. At Paris they changed nurses, and now 
have a pretty dark-eyed young girl, who has a passionate 
fondness for babies. 

Westwater is a beautiful inland town that alike escapes 
the rigors of winter and the intense fires of summer. 
For nearly two hundred years it has been a settlement, 
and the Wentworths were among its early founders. 
There have been proud and honorable names in every 
generation, — perhaps fewer black sheep than in many 
families. They are scattered about in different cities, 
where they have attained eminence in the higher callings. 
There have been statesmen, jurists, savants, and foreign 
ministers, whose scholarly attainments and polished man- 
ners have added honor to the country they served. One 
branch has always remained at Westwater. It is a lovely, 
leisurely place, with long, shaded avenues, where trees 



 



 



 

have stood from fifty to a hundred years, — ebns, maples, 
oaks, and walnuts of different kinds. The houses are 
the large, commodious sort, with wide piazzas, many of 
the roofs upheld to the second story by massive fluted 
columns, and spacious grounds on either side. There 
is a river that makes a sort of detour, winding half 
around, then finding a way back in innumerable curves, 
shaded by trees. Indeed, at one place this is almost an 
island. The fact that it is not navigable for craft of any 
size has perhaps preserved Westwater from ignoble con- 
tact with trade. Bedford, the town below, is a busy, 
thriving place, with furnaces and mills and factories. 
It stretches out a little, but Westwater will be safe from 
its grasp for many years to come. The lower end is 
building up with modern villas and pretentious cottages, 
where the proprietors of these mills and shops retire with 
their families in aristocratic pride, but are barely toler- 
ated, and often passed by in serene silence by these old 
families. 

There is also in the lower part of the town, to the east 
this is, a collegiate institute, quite famous for law and 
divinity, a bishop's residence, and a kind of cathedral 
church, St. Luke's; also a beautiful orphanage, which 
is the pet charity of Westwater. There is wealth, birth, 
breeding, and culture. What more can one ask? Car- 
riages with fine horses wind leisurely through its well- 
kept, shaded streets. There are arched gates, pretty 
lodges, majestic trees, sweeps of velvet lawns, great 
clumps of wisteria, trumpet-creeper, and honeysuckle, 
trained on some dead branching tree or over a dainty 
summer-house, and in June it is a veritable rose garden. 
The newer flower beds cut in the grass here and there 
are voted fussy and common, and the style of Westwater 
disdains them. Still, occasionally you see a massive bed 
of scarlet geraniums, a square of tiger-lilies or crown 
imperial, that seem to set the air ablaze, or a garden of 
heliotrope that scents all the air around. 



 



 



 

Elm Place is at the West End. Along the avenue for 
hundreds of yards they have grown to their stateliest 
perfection, and lent their name to the estate that half a 
century ago and further back was known simply as The 
Wentworth's. It is not only a large estate, but com- 
prises outlying farms, rented on long leases. There is 
also money invested on mortgages at Bedford sufficient 
to keep up any state. 

The Gilberts choose the day train for Doris's sake, al- 
though Mr. Gilbert holds day travelling in utter contempt. 
The journey has been warm and tiresome, and late in tlie 
afternoon Doris is handed out, cramped by so much sitting 
still. She never fidgets. Endurance is a strange, or, 
rather, unusual virtue in one so young, but it seems to 
have been largely Doris's portion, thus far. 

The carriage is waiting There is an air about it and 
the coachman that attracts the attention of the young 
mistress of the Elms. Why she has connected America 
rather with the Gilberts than with her husband she can- 
not tell, but she feels that she has. Suddenly she goes 
back to his atmosphere. 

Her veil is down, but she can see a little through it. 
What lovely homes, in a sort of rural simplicity ! There 
is not the color and glare of Naples, not the sombreness 
or the majesty of many old cities, but she recognizes the 
sort of intangible repose, as if Westwater was set apart 
from common connection with the e very-day world. She 
catches glimpses of verandas, where elegant women and 
girls sit in white, flowing robes ; here and there a bright 
group is gathered on a croquet ground, for lawn tennis 
has barely come in. Fountains send out sprays of mist 
that fall in miniature rainbows ; a carriage bowls along, 
and they meet an elegant party on horseback. Then they 
reach this long line of magnificent elms, and their equipage 
turns up the broad avenue. 

"Home, Doris," her uncle says, in triumph, — "the 
boy's home and yours." 



Doris dislikes extremely to hear any reference made to 
the child as the author of her good fortune. It is not 
hers, but his; and to call the sweet, unconscious infant 
" the boy " is almost like a stab. 

The front of the mansion is of gray hewn stone. It is 
irregular, and has had wings added on from time to time. 
She is conscious of a winding flight of stone steps : one 
goes down on either side of the great porch, and describes 
a half -circle, in which is set tree ferns, oleanders in richest 
bloom, and stiff-leaved century plants. There is a wide, 
arched doorway, nospitably open, another at the rear, and 
through some greenery there the sun is sifted in rifts of 
quivering gold. 

Some one comes toward her with stately step and mien. 
Doris feels strange and small, and a sense as of being an 
interloper creeps over her. 

"How do you do?" her uncle says, rather loudly, to 
this elegant woman in her trailing silk and crape. " This 
is my niece, Mrs. Lloyd Wentworth, and this is my wife, 
Mrs. Gilbert; Mrs. Wentworth, ladies, the aunt of our 
dear — " he stumbles a little, and retrieves himself with 
the Christian name, — " Lloyd." 

" I hope you have had a comfortable journey, and are 
well." The tone is very distant, and has in it an inde- 
scribable something that drops on Doris's heart like lead. 
"Martha, will you take them up-stairs? for, of course, 
you are tired," to the ladies. " You will find the rooms 
in readiness " ; she is careful not to give the rooms any 
homelike air by adding the cordial possessive "your." 
" Whatever you need for the child will be sent up ; and 
your luggage?" 

" That will be here presently," says the spokesman. 

They ascend the broad staircase of polished oak, that 
leads to a hall above wide enough for a gallery. The 
doors stand open. 

"This, I believe, is for Mrs. Wentworth," Martha 
remarks, quietly. 



It is spacious, with southwesterly exposure, but is in 
some way shaded from the sun. Doris can feel tliat it is 
beautiful, although in simple summer garniture. She lays 
her satchel and handkerchief on the console ; she takes 
off her bonnet and her long veil that enfolds her. She is 
thinner, and looks worn and tired, but her face is that of 
a child. It looks really more youthful than six months 
ago. 

The baby wakes and cries. He has been very good all 
day ; indeed, is seldom cross. Marie shakes out the white 
bundle and smooths the long robe, loving and talking in a 
mixture of French ai^d English. Doris turns and stands 
before a mirror and is frightened. The glass not only 
reflects her slim figure and pale face, but the large apart< 
ment, its snowy bed in heavy black-walnut garnishings, 
the pictures, the chairs, the bright, soft rugs on the green- 
ish white matting, the great chimney-piece and open fire- 
place set around with red brick, and the tall andirons 
crossed at an angle. 

Has he been here ? For a moment she almost looks for 
his ghost to enter the open door. She remembers a verse 
he was very fond of, beginning, — 

'' All houses wherein men have lived and died, 
Are haunted houses " ; 

and with a great pang she recalls the fact that he did not 
die here. No soundless, intangible ghost can meet her on 
any threshold, and there is an agony of intense passion 
and despair, as if she just realized that he had gone out 
of her life forever. 

Doris takes the child and drops into a low willow rocker. 
It is crying in sore earnest now, and she bows over it, 
her tears mingling with its unsorrowful ones, although 
they seem full of anguish. A new life stares her in the 
face. She is not only the child's mother, but Lloyd Went- 
worth's widow ; and she is only eighteen. Life stretches 
out interminably.
