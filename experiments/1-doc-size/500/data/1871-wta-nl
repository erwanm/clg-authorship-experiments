Boris Godunoff had procured the assassination of Dimitri, the youngest
son of Ivan the Terrible, a lad only ten years old. A Polish prince,
irritated by the negligence of a young man who had been in his employ
but a short time, gave him a blow on the side of the head, which was
accompanied by a very opprobrious epithet.

"'If you knew who I am, prince,' replied the young man, with tears in
his eyes, 'you would not treat me so, nor call me by that name.'

"'Who are you, and where do you come from?' asked the prince.

"'I am the Czarovitz Dimitri, son of Ivan IV.'

"He then detailed the manner of his escape from Boris's assassin,
and exhibited a Russian seal, bearing the names and arms of the
Czarovitz, and a gold cross adorned with jewels, which he declared was
the baptismal gift of his godfather. The prince believed his story,
and rendered him efficient help. He was presented to the Palatine of
Sandomir, whose daughter was plighted to him in marriage. He procured
the favor of Sigismond, King of Poland, by promising to bring Russia
over to the church of Rome. With a considerable army, including many
Polish knights, he marched into Russia, and after some discouragements,
took the city of Novgorod, and finally, by the treachery of some of
Boris's dependants, entered Moscow, and was duly crowned. Though he
had renounced the Greek Church, he concealed the fact. The widow of
Ivan IV. was brought from a convent to see him, and after a private
interview between them, she acknowledged that he was her son. His
affianced wife came to him in Moscow, attended by a numerous retinue
of Polish knights. The marriage was solemnized according to the rites
of the Russian church. But Dimitri was not skilful in concealing his
religion, and excited the suspicion of the priests and others. While he
was generous even to his foes, his heterodoxy was the ruin of him. A
conspiracy was organized, and he was murdered in cold blood, with many
of his followers, and his corpse exposed to great indignities.

"After his death the boyar Shuiska was crowned as Czar, under the title
Basil VI. Encouraged by the example of the false Dimitri, another
appeared, and many Polish knights supported his claim with arms. The
Czar appealed to Sweden for aid, which compelled the King of Poland to
espouse the cause of the pretender. The Swedes soon went over to the
Poles, Moscow was captured, and Basil VI. died in a Polish prison. The
Poles compelled the boyars to elect Vladislas, son of Sigismond, their
Czar. The new power treated Russia as a subdued province, which caused
an insurrection, and the Poles were driven from the country.

"The throne was now vacant, and in 1613 Michael Romanoff, the first
sovereign of the present royal family, was chosen emperor. He made
peace with the Swedes, and restored the commercial ties which had been
broken by the wars. In 1645 he was succeeded by his son Alexis, who won
the allegiance of the Cossacks of the Don, and regained the western
part of Russia, which had been held by the Poles. In this reign a
third false Dimitri appeared; but he obtained few adherents, and was
executed by Alexis. This Czar was followed by his son Fedor, in 1676,
who lived but six years after his accession, leaving no children; but
he had a brother and several sisters, children of his own mother, and
a half brother and half sister, children of his father's second wife.
The heir apparent was his own brother Ivan, who was weak in body and
in mind, while the half brother, Peter, was a brilliant youth of ten.
An attempt was made to set Ivan aside; but his sister, the Princess
Sophia, frustrated the plan so far as to cause both to be declared
sovereigns of Russia, and she was proclaimed the regent, who was
practically to rule the country. It is alleged that Sophia and Prince
Galitzin, her minister, organized a conspiracy to take the life of
Peter, when he was about seventeen, in order that she might continue
in the regency during the reign of his imbecile brother. Peter fled to
a monastery, followed by a portion of his party, and there organized
a counter movement. He managed his case so well that it was entirely
successful.

"The conspirators were severely punished; some of them were cruelly
tortured. Prince Galitzin escaped with his life, but forfeited his
immense property, and was banished to the northern regions of Russia,
while Sophia was shut up in a convent during the rest of her life. Ivan
declined to take any share in the government, and Peter was the sole
ruler in fact, if not in name. He is the Peter the Great of history,
and the founder of Russian greatness. In a brief period he made his
country one of the most powerful in Europe. In 1703 he founded St.
Petersburg, in a very unfortunate location, it must be confessed,
for at times the city has hard work to keep itself above water. His
ruling passion was to extend his empire, as well as to build it up, by
developing its resources. Though he suffered great defeats, he finally
carried all his plans. He made war on Sweden, and crushed Charles XII.
in the battle of Pultowa. He conquered the Ukraine, and carried his
conquests to the Caspian. He was a wonderful man; but he was a drunkard
and a brute in his manners. He was a genius in mechanics, and possessed
remarkable energy in the execution of his purposes; but he was
passionate, cold-blooded, and cruel. It is no wonder that his country
venerates his name, for no single man ever did so much for a nation as
he for Russia.

"Peter hated his first wife, who was the mother of the Czarovitz
Alexis, and he extended his hatred to his son, whom he first
disinherited, and afterwards poisoned with his own hands, in the
fortress of St. Petersburg. Though the fierce Czar had quarrelled with
Catharine, his wife, and had some doubts in regard to her character,
she was his successor. She was almost as remarkable a person as he
was, and had a powerful influence over him. She was born in Sweden,
but spent her earlier years as a servant in Livonia, one of the Baltic
provinces of Russia, which formerly belonged to Sweden. At the age of
sixteen she was married to a Swedish dragoon, who was ordered away two
days after the marriage. The town in which she lived was captured by
the Russians, and she was employed as a servant in the family of the
Princess Mentchikof, where Peter first saw her. He carried her away
with him, and perceiving that she had a large capacity for assisting
in the mission of his life, he privately married her in 1707, and
repeated the ceremony publicly four years later.

"From a common servant girl of the humblest parentage, she became the
empress of a mighty nation. After her husband's death, she endeavored
to carry out his progressive measures, during the two years of her
reign; but she softened the rule of the Czar by lowering the taxes,
and recalling the exiles from Siberia. Mentchikof was perhaps the
real ruler, though her gentleness and humanity are apparent in public
measures. Peter II., the son of the unfortunate Alexis, succeeded her,
according to the will of the empress. He was only twelve years old,
and a council of regency was appointed to rule during his minority;
but Prince Mentchikof soon seized the supreme control, and the young
emperor was betrothed to his daughter. He was so arrogant and brutal,
that he finally disgusted his imperial master, and with his whole
family, including the affianced of Peter, was banished to Siberia,
and his wealth confiscated. He had nine million rubles in notes and
securities, one million in cash, one hundred and five pounds of gold
utensils, four hundred and twenty pounds of silver plate, and a million
rubles' worth of precious stones, besides his palaces, and numerous
landed estates, all over Russia. His property was not less than forty
millions, or thirty millions of our money, most of which he had stolen
from the public treasury. Prince Dolgoruki took his place at the head
of the government.

"Peter died of small-pox, three years after his accession. He was the
last male member of the Romanoff family. Instead of following the line
of succession indicated in the will of Catharine I., who had daughters
still living, the nobles elected, as their empress, Anna, Duchess
of Courland, daughter of Ivan V., half brother of Peter I., who had
nominally reigned with him. It was intended that the boyars should be
the real rulers, and they induced Anna, before she was crowned, to
sign an instrument which placed all power in their hands; but when she
became empress, she repudiated the compact, and retained the absolute
power of her predecessors. In a civil war for the throne of Poland,
Anna sided with Augustus III., whose success gave Russia a controlling
influence in the affairs of this unhappy kingdom. Her favorite, Duke
Biren, her prime minister, and the actual ruler, was an arrogant and
cruel man, whose influence over the empress was all-powerful. By his
advice, she named, as her successor, the son of her niece Anne,--a
child in the cradle,--with Biren as the regent. He was Ivan VI.

"The unpopularity of the regent soon caused his overthrow, and Anne
was appointed in his place; but in a year after the death of the
Empress Anna, Elizabeth Petrovna, the daughter of Peter the Great and
Catharine,--a woman of no character,--usurped the throne. In a single
night her adherents captured the palace, and completed the revolution.
She reigned twenty-one years, and founded several universities, and
other literary and scientific institutions. She abolished the death
penalty and the rack, but the knout and other tortures took their
place, and the exiles to Siberia were numerous. In the Seven Years'
War, Russia was on the side of Austria. Elizabeth was a vain and
extravagant woman. She impoverished her treasury, and left a bad
reputation behind her.

"By her will she made her nephew Peter, late Duke of Holstein-Gottorp,
emperor; and from him, the present royal family is called the House
of Holstein-Gottorp. He attempted many reforms, and closely allied
himself to Frederick the Great, of Prussia; but many of his measures
were imprudent and impolitic. His wife Catharine was the daughter of
a princess of Holstein-Gottorp. Peter neglected her, and incurred her
hatred. She got up a conspiracy against him, which resulted in the
dethronement of her husband, only a few months after his accession,
and she was proclaimed empress as Catharine II. Peter was thrown
into prison, and there strangled. Her reign of thirty-four years was
brilliant for Russia, which became one of the Great Powers, without
dispute. She greatly enlarged its territory by the infamous partition
of Poland, the conquest of the Crimea, and the addition of Courland,
on the Baltic. Her most noted ministers and favorites were Orlof and
Potemkin.

"Her son Paul I. succeeded her in 1796. His mother had neglected him
in early years, and hated him when he became a man, keeping spies near
him, compelling him to live away from the court, and depriving him
of all power and influence. She had caused the murder of his father,
and the hatred was reciprocal. After his accession, he gave funeral
honors to his father, disinterred his mother's last favorite, Potemkin,
and threw his remains into a ditch. His temper had been soured by
his mother's treatment, and he took a malicious pleasure in undoing
what she had done. The revolution in France was in progress when he
came to the throne, and Paul joined the coalition against her, sending
his armies into Switzerland, Italy, and Holland, to fight against the
French republic. Suvarof, in these campaigns, proved himself to be one
of the greatest generals of his age, and is still held in the highest
veneration by the Russians. But the emperor, dissatisfied with his
allies, withdrew his armies from the coalition, and, with Denmark and
Sweden, joined in the armed neutrality, of which I have spoken to you
before.

"Paul was capricious, despotic, and subject to fits of partial
insanity, which aggravated his ill temper, and caused him to commit
the most atrocious deeds. By his second wife he had ten children, the
oldest of whom was Alexander, the Czarovitz; the second, Constantine;
and the youngest but one, Nicholas. Paul's humors were unendurable,
and Alexander consented to his dethronement, to avoid greater evils to
the empire. He signed a proclamation, announcing his assumption of the
crown. The conspirators found the emperor in his palace. Breaking into
his chamber, they required him to sign his abdication, and his refusal
brought on a struggle, in which, after a desperate resistance, he was
strangled with a sash. Alexander had not consented to the assassination
of his father, and the event filled him with passionate grief. This was
in 1801, and the new emperor was twenty-five years old, and a man of
decided ability. He was in favor of peace; but it was impossible for
him not to take part in the general war against Napoleon, though he
first entered into an alliance with him.

"The Russians and Austrians were defeated at Austerlitz in 1805.
Alexander joined his army to that of Prussia, and both were
disastrously defeated at Friedland in 1807, and the emperor was obliged
to conclude a peace with Napoleon at Tilsit, in which he was arrayed
against England and Sweden. The French stirred up a war in Turkey, in
which the Russians obtained Moldavia and Wallachia. A war with Sweden
resulted in the conquest of Finland. In 1810 Alexander, finding that
he had nothing more to gain by an alliance with France,--that his
commerce was suffering under the provisions of the treaty of Tilsit,
and that the marriage of Napoleon with Maria Louise would prevent him
from obtaining any more territory from Austria,--broke the treaty,
and prepared for war. In 1812 Napoleon marched into Russia late in
the season, with half a million soldiers, intending to crush Russia.
The Russians lost the terrible battle of Borodino, near Moscow, and
even this city fell into the hands of the French; but those who could
not defend it burned it. The winter suddenly set in, and the army of
Napoleon, robbed of their expected supplies and shelter in Moscow,
commenced that disastrous retreat which ended only in the total
destruction of the Grand Army. Prussia and Austria joined Russia the
next year; in the battle of Leipsic, the power of the French was
effectually broken, and in 1814 the allies entered Paris, and Napoleon
was sent to Elba. He returned, and was finally defeated in the battle
of Waterloo, and sent to St. Helena. The war ended, and Alexander
turned his attention to the internal affairs of the nation. He labored
earnestly to promote the civilization of his people, and to develop
the immense resources of his vast empire. In 1825 he set out on a tour
through his dominions, and died at Taganrag, near the mouth of the
Don, of the Crimean fever. He had been the champion of absolute power,
and had welded more closely the chains of Poland; yet, judged by the
Russian standard, he was an amiable and good man.

"At his death his brother Constantine was the Czarovitz; but this
prince had voluntarily renounced his right to the throne in favor of
his younger and only surviving brother Nicholas, who was proclaimed
Czar. A conspiracy, fomented before his accession, was sternly and
severely suppressed. Nicholas, like his brother, was despotic in his
ideas, and remorselessly crushed the insurrection in Poland in 1830,
making the kingdom a province of Russia. He enlarged his dominions,
and carried on the war in Circassia, which lasted fifty years. In 1853
Nicholas demanded of the Turkish government certain guarantees of the
rights of Greek Christians in Turkey, which the latter could not give
without yielding its sovereign rights, and a war ensued, in which
England, France, and Sardinia took part with the Turks. It was the
evident design of the Czar to conquer Turkey, and extend his dominions
to the Mediterranean.

"Nicholas did not live to see the end of this war, and was succeeded by
his son, Alexander II., in 1856. Sebastopol was captured after a siege
of about a year, and a treaty of peace was signed, by which Russia lost
her naval superiority in the Black Sea.[B] The war in the Caucasus
was continued, and ended by Alexander II., who is still the reigning
emperor."

[Footnote B: This provision of the treaty was abrogated by Russia in
1870.]

The professor closed his lecture, which, though longer than usual, was
listened to with interest to the end by the students.

"Young gentlemen," said the principal, "I desire to give you an
opportunity to see as much as possible of Russia, and for this purpose
you will all have an opportunity to visit Moscow; but I do not purpose
to go there in a body. There will be no ship's duty done at present. We
will divide you into four squads; the ship's companies of the consorts
forming two of them, the starboard watch of the ship the third, and the
port the fourth squad. A fifth party will make a more extended trip to
Nijni Novgorod and Kazan, down the Volga. The captain of each vessel
may appoint one to go on this journey, and four more will be elected
by ballot to-morrow night, two for the ship, and one for each of the
consorts, after your return from St. Petersburg."

Mr. Lowington retired amid the applause of the students.




CHAPTER IX.

SIGHTS IN ST. PETERSBURG.


"Appointed by the captain!" sneered De Forrest, as the students left
the steerage.

"I wonder what that's for," added Beckwith.

"I don't know; it's a puzzler to me. But the principal seems to be
trying to make Cantwell as big a man as he can."

"Well, I don't think you ought to find any fault about it. You worked
this thing up, and made him captain," interposed Sheridan, the new
fourth lieutenant, who had been raised to his present rank from first
midshipman, by the votes of the Bangwhangers.

"I made him captain!" exclaimed De Forrest.

"Certainly you did; his merit-rank would only have made him fourth
lieutenant. We don't always do just what we intend," laughed Sheridan.
"It was your idea to make the captain dependent upon the crew for his
office."

"I think it's a good thing to do so," replied De Forrest.

"Then it's a good thing also to make the crew dependent upon the
captain. If he can appoint one of the party for the Volga excursion,
his favor is worth something," added Sheridan, good-naturedly.

"I would give fifty dollars out of my spending money for the privilege
of going," said De Forrest.

"Suppose you make the captain the offer?"

"I! Humph! Do you think I would go down on my knees to Cantwell?"
sneered De Forrest.

"Don't you do it! There's no law to compel you to do so," laughed
Sheridan.

"Of course the captain will reward some one of his friends," said
Beckwith.

"Yes, I suppose he will."

"Would you appoint a fellow that had worked against you?" asked
Sheridan.

"I should try to be fair," answered the first purser, with a struggle
to look dignified.

"Precisely so! Just as you nominated yourself over the heads of Judson
and Norwood, and tried to cut them out."

"They worked for themselves, and I only did the same."

"If every fellow works for himself, we shall not come out anywhere."

"You needn't say anything, Sheridan. You went from first middy up to
fourth lieutenant by the voting," said De Forrest.

"I went just one place higher than my merit-rank, while you were No.
11, and tried to get into No. 3."

"Never mind that now," interposed Beckwith. "Whom shall we elect?
That's the question."

"I don't think we need trouble ourselves much about that matter,"
replied De Forrest, gloomily. "The fellows in the steerage will attend
to all that, and neither of the two will be taken from the cabin."

"I will venture to say that one of the two will be elected from the
cabin," said Sheridan.

"Do you belong to that secret society, Sheridan?" asked Beckwith.

"I do not; but I think that the fellows that manage it mean to be fair."

"Humph! They lifted you up."

"That's so. They did; but I never asked them to do it, or electioneered
with any of them," responded Sheridan.

"But can't we do something?" suggested Beckwith. "The vote for captain
stood forty-eight to forty; and Cantwell's vote was the strength of the
opposition. If we can change five votes, we can elect our men."

"Very true; but can you unite your forty votes on two candidates."

"Yes; why not?" asked De Forrest, encouraged by this presentation of
the subject.

"Who shall the candidates be?" inquired Sheridan, with a twinkle of the
eye. "You want the two most popular fellows in the ship."

"Lincoln for one," said Beckwith.

"Good! He runs well with both parties. You can elect him. Who next?"
continued Sheridan.

"I should like to go for the other," said De Forrest.

"I thought so," laughed Sheridan.

"Why shouldn't I go, as well as any other fellow?" demanded the first
purser.

"And why should you in preference to any other fellow? If you want
to carry your ticket, you must nominate the other candidate from the
steerage. That's fair."

"I don't believe in it," protested De Forrest. "I won't vote for a
fellow in the steerage."

"Precisely so. Then you, and such fellows as you, will throw the
election into the hands of the secret society. That's the whole of it.
Be fair, and the steerage will go with you."

"Whom do you say in the steerage?" asked Beckwith.

"Any good fellow; say Scott."

"No, sir!" exclaimed De Forrest, decidedly. "I would jump overboard
before I would vote for him."

"Suppose the captain should select Lincoln," continued Sheridan, his
eye still twinkling merrily.

"Then we should have to take some other fellow from the cabin," replied
Beckwith.

"There your chance comes in, De Forrest," winked the fourth lieutenant.

"I think I have just as good a right to go as any other fellow."

"Say De Forrest and Scott; and Scott's name on the ticket will carry
the other name," chuckled Sheridan, though he spoke as soberly as he
could.

"That alters the case," added De Forrest, musing. "If Lincoln is not to
be on the ticket, it makes it altogether a different affair."

"But if you are going to scratch Scott's name, and jump overboard,
rather than vote for him, it's no use of talking."

"I should like to have all these differences healed up, so that my plan
may have a fair trial," said the first purser.

"Well, think of it," continued Sheridan; "and if the fellows conclude
to nominate the ticket I suggested, I have no doubt it can be elected."

"I think, under the circumstances, I should conclude to vote for Scott."

"Well, that would be a great concession on your part," laughed
Sheridan, as he went forward to talk with others about the matter which
so deeply interested all hands.

Of course he spoke with Scott first on the subject, and suggested a
general caucus of officers and seamen, to which the joker readily
assented, and promised, if the business was fairly conducted, to keep
it out of the secret society. The matter was talked over till the
lights were put out.

The next morning, after the decks had been washed down, and breakfast
disposed of, a small steamer, which had been engaged by the principal,
came alongside, and all hands went on board of her. All the students
from the consorts, with their instructors, joined them, and the steamer
started. Though she was Russian, she was not very different from any
other of her class. After passing out of the harbor, the boat entered
the broad estuary which forms the mouth of the Neva. It was shoal
water, and the channel was narrow and very crooked, and the craft
twisted about almost as much as on one of our western rivers. As the
distance from Cronstadt to the capital is only seventeen miles, the
expectant excursionists were soon in sight of St. Petersburg. Though
the city is built on low, level ground, the aspect of it, seen from
the sea, is very striking. It was different from any other city the
students had seen.

"There's a gilded dome," said Commodore Lincoln.

"That's St. Isaac's Cathedral," replied Dr. Winstock. "And you see
blue, green, and white domes."

"There is one with stars on it."

"A very common decoration," added the doctor, as the steamer entered
the Great Neva.

At the city the river divides into several branches, and forms half a
dozen large islands, and some forty smaller ones, on which a portion
of the town is built. The southern branch is called the Great Neva, on
which are most of the landing-places of the steamers. Another branch
is called the Little Neva, and the two on the north are the Great and
Little Nevka.

"This is the English Quay," continued the surgeon, pointing to the
right as the steamer approached the long iron bridge, which takes the
name of Nicholas, in whose reign it was built, and is eleven hundred
feet long.

"This seems to be about the end of this cruise," added Lincoln, as he
glanced at the bridge.

"The steamer stops at this floating stage on the left; but there is a
draw in the bridge, by which vessels may go up into Lake Ladoga."

The boat came up to the stage, on which was a house. Mr. Fluxion, the
first vice-principal, was there, for he had been sent up the day before
to make the arrangements for the visit. A dozen omnibuses stood in the
broad street, in and on which the students bestowed themselves. The
surgeon and the commodore took places with a driver. The two horses
at the pole were harnessed as in America; but on the nigh side was a
