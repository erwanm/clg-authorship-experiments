above the dead weight at her heart. 

And now, having said "Au revoir" to Monsieur 
and Madame, and fixed upon a day for their 
visit to the Forsthaus, she turned to Yvonne 
and took her hand. 

"Mademoiselle, I regret so much to hear that 
you are not quite strong. But when you come 
to Trauerbach, Mama and I will take such good 
care of you that you will not mind the fatigue." 

The sad blue eyes looked into the clear grey 
ones, and once more Ruth responded with a 
passion of grief and pity. 

How Rex made his adieux Ruth never knew. 

When he overtook her, she and Sepp were 
well started down the path to the Jagd-hiitte. 
They seemed to be having a duette of silence, 
which Rex turned into a trio when he joined 
them. 

For such walkers as they all were the distance 
they had to go was nothing. Soft afternoon 
lights were still lying peacefully beside the long 
afternoon shadows as they approached the little 
hut, and Sepp answered the colonel's abortive 



 

attempt at a Jodel with one so long and com 
plicated that it seemed as if he were taking that 
means to express all he should have liked to say 
in words. The spell broken, he turned about 
and asked: 

"Also! what did the French people," he 
wouldn't call them "Herrschaft," "say to the 
gracious Fraulein's splendid shot?" 

Ruth stopped and looked absently at him, 
then flushed and recovered herself quickly. It 
was the first time she had remembered her stag. 

"I fear," said she, "that French people would 
disapprove a young lady's shooting. I did not 
tell them." 

Sepp went on again with long strides. The 
four little black hoofs of the chamois stuck pitifully up out of the bag on his broad back. 
When he was well out of hearing he growled 
aloud: 

"Hab"'s schon g wusst ! Jesses, Marie and 
Josef! was is denn dos!" 

That evening when Rex and the Jaeger were 
fussing over the chamois beard and dainty 
horns, inside the Hiitte, Ruth and her father 
stood without, before the closed door. The skies 





were almost black, and full of stars. Through 
the wide fragrant stillness came up now and 
then a Jodel from some Bursch going to visit 
his Sennerin. A stamp, and a comfortable sigh 
came at times from Nani's cows in their stall 
below. 

Ruth put both arms around her father's neck 
and laid her head down on his shoulder. 

"Tired, Daisy?" 

"Yes, dear." 



CHAPTER XV. 

Supper was over, evening had fallen; but 
there would be no music to night under the 
beech-tree; the sky was obscured by clouds and 
a wet wind was blowing. 

Mrs. Dene and Ruth were crossing the hall; 
Gethryn came in at the front door and they met. 

"Well?" said Rex, forcing a smile. 

"Well," said Ruth. "Mademoiselle Descartes 
is better. Madame will bring her down-stairs 
by and by. It appears that wretched peasant 
who drove them has been carrying them about 
for hours from one inn to another, stopping to 
drink at all of them. No wonder they were 
tired out with the worry and his insolence!" 

"It appears Miss Descartes has had attacks 
of fainting like this more than once before. The 
doctor in Paris thinks there is some weakness 
of the heart, but forbids her being told " said 
Mrs. Dene. 

Ruth interposed quickly, not looking at Geth 
ryn: 


"Tapa and Monsieur Bordier, where are they?" 

"I left them visiting Federl and Sepp in their 
quarters." 

"Well, you will find us in that dreadful little 
room yonder. It's the only alternative to sit 
ting in the Bauernstube with all the wood-chop 
pers, and their bad tobacco, since out of doors 
fails us. We must go now and make it as pleas 
ant as we can." 

Ruth made a motion to go, but Mrs. Dene 
lingered. Her kind eyes, her fair little faded 
face, were troubled. 

"Madame Bordier says the young lady tells her 
she has met you before, Rex." 

"Yes, in Paris;" for his life he could not have 
kept down the crimson flush that darkened his 
cheeks and made his temples throb. 

Mrs. Dene's manner grew a little colder. 

"She seems very nice. You knew her people, 
of course." 

"No. I never met any of her people," an 
swered Rex, feeling like a kicked coward. Ruth 
interposed once more. 

"People !" said Ruth, impatiently. "Of course 
Rex only knows nice people. Come, mother!" 




Putting her arm around the old lady, she moved 
across the hall with decision. As they passed 
into the cheerless little room, Rex held open the 
door. Ruth, entering after her mother, looked 
in his face. It had grown thinner; shadows 
were deep in the temples; from the dark circles 
under the eyes to the chin ran a line of pain. 
She held out her hand to him. He bent and 
kissed it. 

He went and stood in the porch, trying to 
collect his thoughts. The idea of this meeting 
between Ruth and Yvonne was insupportable. 
Why had he not taken means any, every 
means to prevent it? He cursed himself. He 
called himself a coward. He wondered how 
much Ruth divined. The thought shamed him 
until his cheeks burned again. And all the while 
a deep under-current of feeling was setting to 
ward that drooping little figure in black, as he 
had seen it for a moment when she alighted 
from the carriage and was supported to a room 
upstairs. Heavens! How it reminded him of 
that first day in the Place de la Concorde ! Why 
was she in mourning? What did the doctor 
mean by "weakness of the heart?" What was 




she doing on mountain tops, and on the stage 
of a theater if she had heart disease ? He started 
with a feeling that he must go and put a stop 
to all this folly. Then he remembered the let 
ter. She had told him another man had the 
right to care for her. Then she was at this 
moment deserted for the second time, as well 
as faithless to still another lover! To how 
many more? And it was through him that a 
woman of such a life was brought into contact 
with Ruth! And Ruth's parents had trusted 
him; they thought him a gentleman. His brain 
reeled. 

The surging waves of shame and self-con 
tempt subsided, were forgotten. He heard the 
wind sough in the Luxembourg trees, he smelled 
the pink flowering chestnuts, a soft voice was 
in his ear, a soft touch on his arm, her breath 
on his cheek, the old, old faces came crowding 
up. Clifford's laugh rang faintly, Braith's grave 
voice; odd bits and ends of song floated out from 
the shadows of that past, and through the 
troubled dream of face and laugh and music, so 
long, so long passed away, he heard the gentle 
voice of Yvonne: "Rex, Rex, be true to me; I 
will come back!" 




"I loved her!" he muttered. 

There was a stir, a door opened and shut, 
voices and steps sounded in the room, on his left. 
He leaned forward a little and looked through 
the uncurtained window. 

It was a bare and dingy room containing only 
a table, some hard chairs, and an old "Fliigel" 
piano, with a long inlaid case. 

They sat together at the table. Ruth's back 
was toward him; she was speaking. Yvonne 
was in the full light. Her eyes were cast down, 
and she was nervously plaiting the edge of her 
little black-bordered handkerchief. All at once 
she raised her eyes, and looked straight at the 
window. How blue her eyes were! 

Rex dropped his face in his hands. 

"Oh God! I love her!" he groaned. 

u Gute Nacht, gnadige Herrn!" 

Sepp and Federl stood in their door with a 
light. Two figures were coming down from the 
Jaeger's cottage. Gethryn recognized the 
colonel and Monsieur Bordier. 

At the risk of scrutiny from those cool, elder 
ly, masculine eyes, Rex's manhood pulled itself 
together. He went back to meet them, and 





presently they all joined the ladies in the apology 
for a parlor, where coffee was being served. 

Coming in after the older men, Rex found no 
place left in the little, crowded room, excepting 
one at the table close beside Yvonne. Ruth 
was on the other side. He went and took the 
place, self-possessed and smiling. 

Yvonne made a slight motion as if to rise and 
escape. Only Rex saw it. Yes, one more, 
Ruth saw it. 

"Mademoiselle has studied seriously since I 
had the honor " 

"Oui, Monsieur." 

Her faint voice and timid look were more 
than Ruth could bear. She leaned forward so 
as to shield the girl as much as possible, and 
entered into the lively talk at the other end of 
the table. 

Rex spoke again: "Mademoiselle is quite 
strong, I trust, the stage Sugar? Allow me! 
As I was saying, the stage is a calling which 
requires a good constitution." No answer. 

"But pardon. If you are not strong, how can 
you expect to succeed in your career?" persisted 
Rex. His eyes rested on one frail wrist in its 



 

black sleeve. The sight filled him with an 
ger. 

"I would make my debut if I knew it would 
kill me." She spoke at last, low, but clearly. 

"But why? Mon Dieu!" 

"Madame has set her heart on it. She thinks 
I shall do her credit. She has been good to 
me, so good!" The sad voice fainted and sank 
away. 

"One is good to one's pupils when they are 
going to bring one fame," said Rex bitterly. 

"Madame took me when she did not know I 
had a voice; when she thought I was dying; 
when I was homeless; two years ago." 

"What do you mean?" said Rex sternly, sink 
ing his voice below the pitch of the general con 
versation. "What did you tell me in your let 
ter? Homeless!" 

"I never wrote you any letter." Yvonne raised 
her blue eyes, startled, despairing, and looked 
into his for the first time. 

"You did not write that you had found a a 
home which you preferred to to any you had 
ever had? And that it would be useless to - 
to offer you any other?" 





"I never wrote. I was very ill and could not. 
Afterward I went to you. You were gone." 
Her low voice was heart-breaking to hear. 

"When?" Rex could hardly utter a word. 

"In June, as soon as I left the hospital." 

"The hospital? And your mother?" 

"She was dead. I did not see her. Then I was 
very ill, along time. As soon as I could, I went 
to Paris." 

"To me?" 

"Yes." 

"And the letter?" 

"Ah!"-cried Yvonne with a shudder. "It must 
have been my sister who did that!" 

The room was turning round. A hundred 
lights were swaying about in a crowd of heads. 
Rex laid his hand heavily on the table to steady 
himself. With a strong effort at self-control he 
had reduced the number of lights to two, and 
got the people back in their places, when with 
a little burst of French exclamations and laugh 
ter every one turned to Yvonne, and Ruth bend 
ing over her took both her hands. 

The next moment Monsieur Bordier was lead 
ing her to the piano. 



 

A soft chord, other chords, deep and sweet, 
and then the dear voice: 

"Oui c est un reve, 

Un reve doux'd amour, 

La nuit lui prete son mystere." 

The chain is forged again. The mists of pas 
sion rise thickly, heavily, and blot out all else 
forever. 

He"lene's song ceased. He heard them praise 
her, and heard "Good-nights," and "Aurevoirs" 
exchanged. He rose and stood near the door. 
Ruth passed him like a shadow. They all remained at the foot of the stairs for a moment, 
repeating their "Adieus," and "Remerciements." 
He was utterly reckless, but cool enough still to 
watch for his chance in this confusion of civil 
ities. It came; for one instant he could whis 
per to her, "I must see you to-night." Then 
the voices were gone, and he stood alone on the 
porch, the wet wind blowing in his face, his face 
turned up to a heavy sky covered with black, 
driving clouds. He could hear the river, and 
the moaning of the trees. 

It seemed as if he had stood there for hours, 
never moving. Then there was a step in the 





dark hall, on the threshold, and Yvonne lay 
trembling in his arms. 

The sky was beginning to show a tint of early 
dawn when they stepped once more upon the 
silent porch. The wind had gone down. Clouds 
were piled up in the west, but the east was clear. 
Perfect stillness was over everything. Not a 
living creature was in sight, excepting that far 
up, across the stream, Sepp and Zimbach were 
climbing toward the Schinder. 

"I must go in now. I must, you child!" said 
Yvonne in her old voice, smoothing her hair 
with both hands. Rex held her back. 

"My wife?" he said. 

"Yes!" She raised her face and kissed him 
on the lips, then clung to him weeping. 

"Hush! hush! It is I who should do that," 
he murmured, pressing her cheek against his 
breast. 

Once more she turned to leave him, but he 
detained her. 

"Yvonne, come with me and be married to 
day!" 

"You know it is impossible. To-day! what a 
boy you are! As if we could!" 



 

"Well then, in a few days, in a week, as soon 
as possible." 

"Oh! my dearest! do not make it so hard for 
me! How could I desert Madame so? After 
all she has done for me? When I know all her 
hopes are set on me; that if I fail her she has 
no one ready to take my place! Because she 
was so sure of me, she did not try to bring on 
any other pupil for next autumn. And last sea 
son was a bad one for her and Monsieur. Their 
debutante failed; they lost money. Behold this 
child!" she exclaimed, with a rapid return to 
her old gay manner, "to whom I have explained 
all this at least a hundred times already, and he 
asks me why we cannot be married to-day!" 

Then with another quick change, she laid her 
cheek tenderly against his and murmured: 

"I might have died but for her. You would 
not have me desert her so cruelly, Rex?" 

"My love! No!" A new respect mingled 
with his passion. Yes, she was faithful! 

"And now I will go in! Rex, Rex, you are 
quite as bad as ever! Look at my hair!" She 
leaned lightly on his shoulder, her old laughing 
self, 





He smiled back sadly. 

"Again! After all! You silly, silly boy! 
And it is such a little while to wait!" 

" Belle Helene is very popular in Paris. The 
piece may run a long time." 

"Rex, I must. Don't make it so hard for 
me!" Tears filled her eyes. 

He kissed her for answer, without speak 
ing. 

"Think! think of all she did for me; saved 
me; fed me, clothed me, taught me, when she 
only believed I had voice and talent enough to 
support myself by teaching. It was half a year 
before she and Monsieur began to think I could 
ever make them any return for their care of me. 
And all that time she was like a mother to me. 
And now she has told every one her hopes of me. 
If I fail she will be ridiculed. You know Paris. 
She and Monsieur have enemies who will say 
there never was any pupil, nor any debut ex
