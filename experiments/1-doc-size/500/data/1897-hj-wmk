Mrs. Wix. 

"Then I'll see him alone." The child 
spied what she had been looking for she 
possessed herself of her hat. " Perhaps I 'll 
take him out!" And, with decision, she 
quitted the room. 

When she entered the salon it was empty ; 
but at the sound of the opened door some 
one stirred on the balcony and Sir Claude, 
stepping straight in, stood before her. He 
was in light, fresh clothes and wore a straw 
hat with a bright ribbon; these things, be- 
sides striking her in themselves as the very 
promise of the grandest of grand tours, gave 
him a certain radiance and, as it were, a 
tropical ease ; but such an effect only marked 
rather more his having stopped short and, for 
a longer minute than had ever, at such a 
juncture, elapsed, not opened his arms to 
her. His pause made her pause and enabled 
her to reflect that he must have been up 
some time, for there were no traces of break- 
fast, and that, though it was so late, he had 
rather markedly not caused her to be called 
to him. Had Mrs. Wix been right about 
their forfeiture of the salon? Was it all his 
now, all his and Mrs. Beale's? Such an 





idea, at the rate her small thoughts throbbed, 
could only remind her of the way in which 
what had been hers hitherto was what was 
exactly most Mrs. Beale's and his. It was 
strange to be standing there and greeting 
him across a gulf, for he had by this time 
spoken, smiled, said : " My dear child my 
dear child ! " but without coming any nearer. 
In a flash she saw that he was different 
more so than he knew or designed. The 
next minute indeed it was as if he caught 
an impression from her face: this made him 
hold out his hand. Then they met, he 
kissed her, he laughed, she thought he even 
blushed ; something of his affection rang out 
as usual. " Here I am, you see, again as 
I promised you." 

It was not as he had promised them he 
had not promised them Mrs. Beale; but 
Maisie said nothing about that. What she 
said was simply: "I knew you had come. 
Mrs. Wixtoldme." 

" Oh yes. And where is she ? " 

" In her room. She got me up she 
dressed me." 

Sir Claude looked at her up and down ; a 
sweetness of mockery that she particularly 
loved came out in his face whenever he did 





that, and it was not wanting now. He raised 
his eyebrows and his arms to play at admira- 
tion; he was evidently, after all, disposed to 
be gay. " Got you up ? I should think so ! 
She has dressed you most beautifully. Is n't 
she coming ? " 

Maisie wondered if she had better tell. 
" She said not. " 

" Does n't she want to see a poor devil ? " 

She looked about, under the vibration of 
the way he described himself, and her eyes 
rested on the door of the room he had pre- 
viously occupied. " Is Mrs. Beale in there ? " 

Sir Claude looked blankly at the same 
object. " I have n't the least idea ! " 

"You haven't seen her?" 

"Not the tip of her nose." 

Maisie thought; there settled on her, in 
the light of his beautiful smiling eyes, the 
faintest, purest, coldest conviction that he 
was not telling the truth. " She has n't 
welcomed you? " 

" Not by a single sign. " 

"Then where is she?" 

Sir Claude laughed; he seemed both 
amused and surprised at the point she made 
of it. "I give it up." 

" Does n't she know you 've come ? " 





He laughed again. " Perhaps she does n't 
care ! " 

Maisie, with an inspiration, pounced on 
his arm. " Has she gone ? " 

He met her eyes, and then she could see 
that his own were really much graver than 
his manner. " Gone ? " She had flown to 
the door, but before she could raise her hand 
to knock he was beside her and had caught 
it. " Let her be. I don't care about her. 
I want to see you." 

Maisie fell back with him. "Then she 
hasn't gone? " 

He still looked as if it were a joke; but 
the more she saw of him the more she could 
make out that he was troubled. "It 
wouldn't be like her!" 

She stood looking up at him. " Did you 
want her to come ? " 

"How can you suppose ?" He put it 
to her candidly. " We had an immense row 
over it." 

" Do you mean you 've quarrelled ? " 

Sir Claude hesitated. "What has she 
told you?" 

"That I 'm hers as much as yours. That 
she represents papa. " 

His gaze struck away through the open 





window and up to the sky ; she could hear 
him rattle in his trousers' pocket his money 
or his keys. " Yes that 's what she keeps 
saying. " It gave him for a moment an air 
that was almost helpless. 

"You say you don't care about her," 
Maisie went on. "Do you mean you've 
quarrelled ? " 

"We do nothing in life but quarrel." 

He rose before her, as he said this, so soft 
and fair, so rich, in spite of what might 
worry him, in restored familiarities, that it 
gave a bright blur to the meaning to what 
would otherwise, perhaps, have been the 
tangible promise of the words. " Oh, your 
quarrels ! " she exclaimed with discourage- 
ment. 

" I assure you hers are quite fearful ! " he 
laughed. 

"I don't speak of hers. I speak of 
yours. " 

"Ah, don't do it till I 've had my coffee! 
You're growing up clever," he added. 
Then he said : " I suppose you 've break- 
fasted?" 

" Oh no I 've had nothing." 

" Nothing in your room " he was all com- 
punction. "My dear old man! we'll 





breakfast then together." He had one of 
his happy thoughts. "I say we'll go 
out." 

"That was just what I hoped. I've 
brought my hat." 

"You are clever! We'll go to a cafe"." 
Maisie was already at the door; he glanced 
round the room. "A moment my stick." 
But there appeared to be no stick. "No 
matter; I left it oh!" He remembered, 
with an odd drop, and came out. 

" You left it in London ? " she asked as 
they went downstairs. 

" Yes in London : fancy ! " 

"You were in such a hurry to come," 
Maisie explained. 

He had his arm round her. "That must 
have been the reason." Half way down 
he stopped short again, slapping his leg. 
"And poor Mrs. Wix!" 

Maisie' s face just showed a shadow. " Do 
you want her to come ? " 

" Dear, no I want to see you alone. " 

" That 's the way I want to see you  " she 
replied. " Like before. " 

" Like before ! " he gayly echoed. " But 
I mean has she had her coffee? " 

"No, nothing." 





"Then I 'll send it up to her. Madame ! " 
He had already, at the foot of the stair, 
called out to the stout patronne, a lady who 
turned to him, from the bustling, breezy 
hall, a countenance covered with fresh 
matutinal powder and a bosom as capacious 
as the velvet shelf of a chimney-piece, over 
which her round white face, framed in its 
golden frizzle, might have figured as a showy 
clock. He ordered, with particular recom- 
mendations, Mrs. Wix's repast, and it was 
a charm to hear his easy, brilliant French : 
even his companion's ignorance could meas- 
ure the perfection of it. The patronne, 
rubbing her hands and breaking in with 
high, swift notes, as into a florid duet, went 
with him to the street, and while they 
talked a moment longer Maisie remembered 
what Mrs. Wix had said about every one's 
liking him. It came out enough through the 
morning powder, it came out enough in the 
heaving bosom, how the landlady liked him. 
He had evidently ordered something lovely 
for Mrs. Wix. " Et bien soigne, ri est-ce-pas ? " 

" Soyez tranquille " the patronne beamed 
upon him. " Et pour Madame ? " 

"Madame?" he echoed it just pulled 
him up a little. 





" Rien encore? " 

" Rien encore. Come, Maisie." She hur- 
ried along with him, but on the way to the 
cafe" he said nothing. 



XXX 

AFTER they were seated there it was differ- 
ent : the place was not below the hotel, but 
farther along the quay; with wide, clear 
windows and a floor sprinkled with bran in 
a manner that gave it for visitors a little 
of the added charm of a circus. They had 
pretty much to themselves the painted spaces 
and the red plush benches ; these were shared 
by a few scattered gentlemen who picked 
teeth, with facial contortions, behind small 
bare tables, and by an old personage in par- 
ticular, a very old personage with a red 
ribbon in his buttonhole, whose manner of 
soaking buttered rolls in coffee and then 
disposing of them in the little that was left 
of the interval between his nose and chin 
might at a less anxious hour have cast upon 
Maisie an almost envious spell. They too 
had their cafe* au lait and their buttered 
rolls, determined by Sir Claude's asking her 

 

if she could with that light aid wait till 
the hour of dejeuner. His allusion to this 
meal gave her, in the shaded, sprinkled 
coolness, the scene, as she vaguely felt, of 
a sort of ordered, mirrored license, the 
haunt of those the irregular, like herself 
who went to bed or who rose too late, 
something to think over while she watched 
the white-aproned waiter perform as nimbly 
with plates and saucers as a certain conjurer 
her friend had, in London, taken her to a 
music-hall to see. Sir Claude had presently 
begun to talk again, to tell her how London 
had looked, and how long he had felt him- 
self, on either side, to have been absent ; all 
about Susan Ash too, and the amusement 
as well as the difficulty he had had with 
her; then all about his return journey and 
the Channel in the night and the crowd of 
people coming over and the way there were 
always too many one knew. He spoke of 
other matters besides, especially of what she 
must tell him of the occupations, while he 
was away, of Mrs. Wix and her pupil. 
Had n't they had the good time he had 
promised? had he exaggerated a bit the 
arrangements made for their pleasure? 
Maisie had something not all there was 





to say of his success and of their gratitude: 
she had a complication of thought that grew 
every minute, grew with the consciousness 
that she had never seen him in this particular 
state in which he had been given back. 

Mrs. Wix had once said it was once or 
fifty times; once was enough for Maisie, 
but more was not too much that he was 
wonderfully various. Well, he was cer- 
tainly so, to the child's mind, on the present 
occasion; he was much more various than 
he was anything else. The fact that they 
were together in a shop, at a nice little 
intimate table, as they had so often been 
in London, only, besides, made greater the 
difference of what they were together about. 
This difference was in his face, in his voice, 
in every look he gave her and every move- 
ment he made. They were not the looks 
and the movements he really wanted to 
show, and she could feel as well that they 
were not those she herself wanted. She had 
seen him nervous, she had seen every one 
she had come in contact with nervous, but 
she had never seen him so nervous as this. 
Little by little it gave her a settled terror, 
a terror that partook of the coldness she had 
felt just before at the hotel, to find herself, 





on his answer about Mrs. Beale, disbelieve 
him. She seemed to see at present, to 
touch across the table, as if by laying her 
hand on it, what he had meant when he con- 
fessed on those several occasions to fear. 
Why was such a man so often afraid? It 
must have begun to come to her now that 
there was one thing just such a man above 
all could be afraid of. He could be afraid 
of himself. His fear, at all events, was 
there; his fear was sweet to her, beautiful 
and tender to her, was having coffee and 
buttered rolls and talk and laughter that 
were no talk and laughter at all, with her; 
his fear was in his jesting, postponing, 
perverting voice; it was in just this make- 
believe way he had brought her out to imitate 
the old London playtimes, to imitate indeed 
a relation that had wholly changed, a rela- 
tion that she had, with her very eyes, seen 
in the act of change when the day before, 
in the salon, Mrs. Beale rose suddenly 
before her. She rose before her, for that 
matter, now, and even before their refresh- 
ment appeared Maisie arrived at the straight 
question for which, on their entrance, his 
first word had given opportunity. "Are we 
going to have dejeimev with Mrs. Beale ? " 





His reply was anything but straight. 
"You and I?" 

Maisie sat back in her chair. " Mrs. Wix 
and me." 

Sir Claude also shifted. "That's an in- 
quiry, my dear child, that Mrs. Beale herself 
must answer." Yes, he had shifted; but 
abruptly, after a moment during which 
something seemed to hang there between 
them and, as it heavily swayed, just fan 
them with the air of its motion, she felt 
that the whole thing was upon them. " Do 
you mind," he broke out, "my asking you 
what Mrs. Wix has said to you ? " 

"Said to me?" 

"This day or two, while I was away." 

" Do you mean about you and Mrs. Beale ? " 

Sir Claude, resting on his elbows, fixed 
his eyes a moment on the white marble be- 
neath them. "No; I think we had a good 
deal of that did n't we ? before I left you. 
It seems to me we had it pretty well all out. 
I mean about yourself, about your don't 
you know? associating with us, as I might 
say, and staying on with us. While you 
were alone with our friend what did she 
say?" 

Maisie felt the weight of the question; 





it made her waver and wonder, while her 
companion's eyes remained bent. "Noth- 
ing," she rejoined at last. 

He looked up in surprise. " Nothing? " 

"Nothing," Maisie repeated; on which 
an interruption descended in the form of a 
tray bearing the preparations for their 
breakfast. 

These preparations were as amusing as 
everything else; the waiter poured their 
coffee from a vessel like a watering-pot and 
then made it froth with the curved stream of 
hot milk that dropped from the height of his 
raised arm ; but the two looked across at each 
other, through the whole play of French pleas- 
antness, with a gravity that had now ceased 
to dissemble. Sir Claude sent the waiter off 
again for something and then took up her 
answer. " Has n't she tried to affect you ? " 

Face to face with him thus it seemed to 
Maisie that she had tried so little as to be 
scarce worth mentioning; again therefore, 
an instant, she shut herself up. Presently 
she found her middle course. " Mrs. Beale 
likes her now; and there 's one thing I 've 
found out a great thing. Mrs. Wix enjoys 
her being so kind. She was tremendously 
kind all day yesterday." 





"I see. And what did she do?" Sir 
Claude asked. 

Maisie was now busy with her breakfast, 
and her kind host attacked his own; so 
that it was all in form at least even more 
than their old sociability. " Everything she 
could think of. She was as nice to her as 
you are," the child said. " She talked to her 
all day." 

"And what did she say to her? "
