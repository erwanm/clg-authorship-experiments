The champagne or brandy she was forced to 
order in the dives she haunted, in order to secure 
a table> merely gave her tone for the moment. 

Her nerves were less affected than her spirits. 
She had hours of such black depression that only 
the faint glimmering star of religion kept her 



 

from suicide. She had longer seasons for 
thought on Masters and his ruin — and of the 
hours they had spent together. One night she 
went out to Dolores and sat in the dark little 
church until dawn. She had nothing of the 
saint in her and felt no impulse to emulate 
Concha Arguello, who had become the first nun 
in California J moreover, Razanov had died an 
honorable death through no fault of his or his 
Concha's. She and Langdon Masters were lost 
souls and must expiate their sins in the eyes of 
the world that heaped on their heads its pitiless 
scorn. 

Madeleine threw off her hat and dropped into 
the armchair, oblivious of its bumps. She 
began to cry quietly with none of her former 
hysteria. Holt was nearer to Masters than any 
one she knew, and she was grateful that he had 
not seen her in her hours of supreme degradation. If he ever saw Masters again he would 
tell him of her downfall, of course — and the 
reason for itj but at least he could paint no 
horrible concrete picture. For the first time 
she felt thankful that she had not sxmk lower 
been compelled, indeed, against her will, to 
retrace her steps. She even regretted the 





hideous episode of the ferry boat, although she 
had welcomed the exposure at the time. Her 
pride was lifting its battered head, and although 
she felt no remorse, and was without hope, and 
her unclouded consciousness foreshadowed long 
years of spiritual torment and longing with not 
a diversion to lighten the gloom, she possessed 
herself more nearly that night than since Holt 
had given her what she had believed to be her 
death blow. 

If she could only die. But death was no 
friend of hers. 




THAT afternoon Holt called on Dr. Tal- 
bot in his office. Half an hour later, 
looking flushed and angry, he strolled frowning 
down Bush street, then turned abruptly and 
walked in the direction of South Park. He did 
not know Mrs. McLane but he believed she 
would see him. 

He called at midnight — and on many succeeding nights — for Madeleine and took her 
to several of the dives that seemed to afford her 
amusement. He noticed that she drank little, 
and had a glimmering of the truth. News- 
paper men have several extra senses. It was 
also apparent that the life she had led had not 
made her callous. As he insisted upon " treating " her she would have none of champagne 
but ordered ponies of brandy. 

Now that she had a cavalier she was stared 
at more than formerly, and there was some 
audible ribald comment which Holt did his 
best to ignore J but as time wore on those bent 


 

on hilarity or stupor ceased to notice two people 
uninterestingly sober. 

Holt talked of Masters constantly, relating 
every incident of his sojourn in San Francisco 
he could recall, and of his past that had come to 
his knowledge; expatiating bitterly upon his 
wasted gifts and blasted life. The more Madeleine winced the further he drove in the knife- 
One night they were sitting on a balcony in 
Chinatown. In the restaurant behind them a 
banquet was being given by a party of Chinese 
merchants, and Holt had thought the scene 
might amuse her. The round table was covered 
with dishes no larger than those played with in 
childhood and the portions were as minute. 
The sleek merchants wore gorgeously embroidered costumes, and behind them were women of 
their own race, dressed plainly in the national 
garb, their stiff oiled hair stuck with long pins 
lobed with glass. They were evidently an or- 
chestra, for they sang, or rather chanted, in high 
monotonous voices, as mournful as their gray 
expressionless faces. In two recesses, extended 
on teakwood couches, were Chinamen presumably of the same class as the diners, but wearing 
their daily blue silk imadomed and leisurely 



 

smoking the opium pipe. The room was heavily 
gilded and decorated and on the third floor as 
befitted its rank. Chinamen of humbler status 
dined on the floor below, and the ground restaurant accommodated the coolies. 

On the little balcony, their chairs wedged 
between large vases of growing plants, Madeleine could watch the function without attracting attention or lean over the railing and look 
down upon the narrow street hung with gay 
paper lanterns above the open doors of shops 
that flaunted the wares of the Orient irnder 
strange gilt signs. There were many little 
balconies high above the street and they were 
as brilliantly lit as for a festival. From several 
came the sound of raucous instrumental music 
or that same thin chant as of lost souls wandering in outer darkness. The street was thronged 
with Chinamen of the lower caste in dark blue 
cotton smocks, pendent pigtails, and round 
coolie hats. 

It was eight o'clock, but it was Holt's " night 
off " and as he had told her that morning he 
could get a pass for the dinner, and that it was 
time she " changed her bill," she had risen early 
and met him at her door. 



 

It was apparent that she took a lively interest 
in this bit of Shanghai b^t a step out of the 
Occident, for her face had lost its heavy brooding and she asked him many questions. It was 
an hour before Masters' name was mentioned, 
and then she said abruptly: 

" You tell me much of his life out here and 
before he came, but you hardly ever say anything about the present." 

" That sort of life is much of a muchness." 

" How do you hear?" 

" One of the Bulletin men — Tom Lacey — 
went East just after Masters did. He is on the 
Times. Several of us correspond with him." 

" Has — has he ever been — literally, I 
mean — in the gutter?" 

" Probably. He was in a hospital for a time 
and when he came out several of his friends 
tried to buck him up. But it was no use. He 
did work on one of the newspapers — the 
Tribune y I believe — about half sober until he 
had paid his hospital bill with something to 
spare. Then he went to work in the same old 
steady painstaking way to drink himself to 
death." 

"Wh — why did he go to the hospital? 
Was he very ill?" 



 

" Busted the crust of a policeman and got his 
own busted at the same time.'' 

" How is it you spared me this before?" 

He pretended not to see her tears, or her 
working hands. 

"Didn't want to give you too heavy doses 
at once, but you are so much stronger that I 
chanced it. He's been in more than one spectacular affair. One night, in front of the City 
Prison, he tossed the driver off a van as if the 
man had been a dead leaf, and before the guard 
had time to jump to his seat he was on the box 
and had lashed the horses. He drove like mad 
all over New York for hours, the prisoners inside yelling and cursing at the top of their 
lungs. They thought it was a new and devilishly ingenious mode of punishment. When 
the horses dropped he left the van where it 
stood and went home. There was a frightful 
row over the affair. Masters was arrested, of 
course, but bailed out. He has friends still 
and some of them are influential. The trial 
was postponed a few times and then dropped. 
His rows are too numerous to mention. When 
he was here and sober he betrayed anger only 
in his eyes, which looked like steel blades run 



 

through fire, and with the most caustic tongue 
ever put in a man's head. But when he's in 
certain stages of insobriety his fighting instincts 
appear to take their own sweet way. At other 
times, Lacey writes, he is as interesting as ever 
and men sit round eagerly and listen to him 
talk. At others he simply disappears. Did I 
tell you he had come into a little money — just 
recently?'' 

" No, you did not. Why doesn't he start a 
newspaper?" 

"He's probably forgotten he ever wanted 
one — no, I don't fancy he ever forgets anything. Only death will destroy that brain 
no matter how he may obfuscate it. And I 
guess there are times when he can't, poor devil. 
But he couldn't start a newspaper on what he's 
got. It's just enough to buy him all he wants 
without the necessity for work." 

" How did he get it?" 

" His elder brother — only remaining member of the immediate family — died and left 
him the old plantation in Virgina — what there 
is left of it J and a small income from two or 
three old houses in Richmond. Masters told 
me once that when the war left them high and 



 

dry he agreed to waive his share in the estate 
provided his brother would take care of his 
mother and the old place. The estate comes to 
him now, but in trust. At his death, without 
legal heir, it goes to a cousin." 

" Oh, take me home, please. I can't stand 
those wailing women any longer." 



XXXVIII 

A MONTH later there was a tap on Made- 
leine's door. She rose earlier these days 
and opened it at once, assuming that it was a 
message from Holt. But Mr. McLane stood 
there. 

" How are you, Madeleine? May I come 
in?" He shook her half -extended hand as if 
he were paying her an afternoon call at the 
Occidental Hotel, and sat down on the horse- 
hair sofa with a genial smile; pladng his high 
silk hat and gold-headed cane beside him. 

"Glad to see you looking so well. I've 
wanted to call for a long time, but as you 
dropped us all like so many hot potatoes, I 
hesitated, and was delighted today when 
Howard gave me an excuse.'' 

" Howard?" 

" Yes, he wants you to go back to him." 

" That I'll never do." 

" Don't be hasty. He is willing to forget 
everything — he asked me to make you understand that he would never mention the subject. 
He will also put your share of your father's 
estate unreservedly in your hands as soon as the 
usual legal delays are over. You knew that 
your father was dead, did you not? And your 
mother also?" 

" Oh yes, I knew. It didn't seem to make 
any difference. I knew I never should see them 
again anyhow." 

" Howard was appointed trustee of your inheritance, but as I said, he does not mean to take 
advantage of the fact. I am informed, by the 
way, that your brother never told your parents 
that you had left Howard. He knew nothing 
beyond the fact, of course." 

« Well, I am glad of that." 

She had no intention of shedding any tears 
before Mr. McLane. Let him think her callous 
if he must. 

"About Howard?" 

" I'll never go back to him. I never want 
to see him again." 

"Not if he would take you to Europe to live? 
There is ^n opening for an American doctor in 
Paris." 

" I never want to see him again. I know he 



 

is a good man but I hate him. And if I did go
back it would be worse. You may tell him 
that.'' 

" Is your decision irrevocable?" 

" Yes, it is.'' 

" Then I must tell you that if there is no 
prospect of your return he will divorce you." 

"Divorced — I divorced?" Her eyes expanded with horrified astonishment. But only 
for a moment. She threw bade her head and 
laughed. "That was funny, wasn't it? Well, 
let him do as he thinks best. And he may be 
happy once more if I am out of his life altogether. He won't have much trouble getting 
a divorce!" 

" He will obtain it on the ground of desertion." 

"Oh! Well, he was always a very good 
man. Poor Howard! I hope he'll marry 
again and be happy." 

" Better think it over. I — by the way — 
I'm not sure the women wouldn't come round in 
time} particularly if you lived abroad for a 
few years." 

She curled her lip. " And I should have my 
precious position in Society again! How much 



 

do you suppose that means to me? Have the 
fatted calf killed and coals of fire poured on 
my humbled head! Do you think I have no 
pride?" 

"You appear to have regained it. I wish 
you could regain the rest and be the radiant 
creature you were when you came to us. God! 
What a lovely stunning creature you were! It 
hurts me like the devil, I can tell you. And 
it's hurt the women too. They were fond of 
you. Do you know that Sally is dead?" 

" Yes. She had everjrthing to live for and 
she died. Life seems to amuse herself with 
us.'' 

" She's a damned old hag." He rose and 
took up his hat and cane. " Well, I'll wait a 
week, and then if you don't relent the proceedings will begin. I shan't get the divorce. Not 
my line. But he asked me to talk to you and I 
was glad to come. Good-by." 

She smiled as she shook hands with him. As 
he opened the door he turned to her again. 

" That young Holt is a good fellow and has 
a head on his shoulders. Better be guided by 
him if he offers you any advice." 



XXXIX 

ALMOST insensibly and without comment 
Madeleine fell into the habit of sleeping 
at night and going abroad with Holt in the day- 
time. Nor did he take her to any more dives. 
They went across the Bay, either to Oakland 
or Sausalito, and took long walks, dining at 
some inn where they were sure to meet no one 
they knew. She had asked hiiti to buy her 
books, as she did not care to venture either into 
the bookstores or the Mercantile Library. She 
now had a part of her new income to spend as 
she chose, and moved into more comfortable 
rooms, although far from the fashionable 
quarter. She was restless and often very 
nervous but Holt knew that she drank no 
longer. There had been another revolution of 
the wheel : she would have a large income, freedom impended, the future was hers to dispose 
of at will. Her health was excellent  she had 
regained her old proud bearing. 

"What are you going to do with it?" he 





 

asked her abruptly one evening. They were 
sitting in the arbor of a restaurant on the water 
front at Sausalito and had just finished dinner. 
The steep promontory rose behind them a wild 
forest of oak and pine, madrona and chaparral. 
Across the sparkling dark green water San 
Francisco looked a pale blue in the twilight and 
there was a banner of soft pink above her. 
Lights were appearing on the military islands, 
the ferry boats, and yachts. " You will be free 
in about a month now. Have you made any 
plans? You will not stay here, of course." 

" Stay here ! I shall leave the day the decree 
is granted, and Pll never see California again 
as long as I live." 

" But where shall you go?'' 

" Oh — it would be interesting to live in 
Europe." 

" Whether you have admitted it to yourself 
or not you have not the remotest idea of going 
to Europe." 

"Oh?" 

" You are going to Langdon Masters. Nothing in the world could keep you away from 
him — or should." 

" I wish women smoked. You look so placid. 
And I am glad you smoke cigarettes." 



 

"Why not try one?" 

" Oh, no! " She looked scandalized. " I 
never did that — before. The other was for 
a purpose, not because I liked it." 

" I am used to your line of ratiocination. But 
you haven't answered my question." 

" Did you ask one?" 

" In the form of an assertion, yes." 

" You know — the Church forbids marriage 
after divorce." 

"Look here, Madeleine!" Holt brought 
his fist down on the table with such violence that 
she half started to her feet. " Do you mean to 
tell me you are going to let any more damn 
foolishness wreck your life a second time?" 

" You must not speak of the Church in that 
way." 

"Let that pass. I am not going to argue 
with you. You've argued it all out with yourself unless I'm much mistaken. Are you going 
to let Masters kill himself when you can save 
him? Are you going to condemn yourself to 
a miserably solitary, wandering, aimless life, in 
which you are no good to yourself, your Church, 
or any one on earth — and with a crime on 
your soul?" 



 

" I — I — haven't admitted to myself what 
I shall do. It has seemed to me that when I 
am free I shall simply go — " 

"And straight to Masters. As well for a
