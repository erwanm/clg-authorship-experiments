 

a little. There was the great dance on the 
green, the last reception of the seniors, the 
grand play, and last of all, commencement. 

“ If it only won't rain. We have had such 
peerless weather," sighed some one. 

“ In five years we have not had a rainy 
commencement. I don't know whether I have 
been a mascot or not — ” and Miss Morse 
smiled. 

It was a fine day and there was no break 
anywhere. The long procession of girls 
looked charming in their caps and gowns and 
the lovely chain of flowers. It was the largest 
graduating class the college had yet had. The 
exercises were crisp and sparkling, quite to 
the point, and not unduly prolonged. Then 
came the pleasure. 

“Where is your friend of last year?” in- 
quired Miss Mains of Helen. “ And that 
charming young man ! I quite lost my heart 
to him. Are they married? Wasn't she ages 
older than he was?” 

“ Oh ! they were not lovers,” Helen re- 
turned, a bit indignant, then smiled it away. 



The long procession of girls looked charming in their 



“ Why didn’t you ask him this year? Mas- 
culines are at a premium at such times.” 

“ I believe he is in St. Louis,” Helen an- 
swered indifferently. 

“ And no doubt some girl has snapped him 
up. He was so delightful!” 

Was that the way he generally impressed 
people? Well, in a certain way she considered 
him delightful, also. 

“Yesterday, cake; to-day, crumbs,” sang 
out some one in the corridor the next morning. 
“ Yesterday, the fluffiest and airiest of gowns, 
to-day, sombre tailor-made suits; yesterday, 
laughter, to-day — ” 

“ Sniffles,” interrupted another. “ Oh, 
girls! what’s the use? We’re coming back if 
the fates permit, so what’s the use of tears and 
sighing when we’re all jolly glad of the long 
vacation? Take care. Don’t break your 
necks over the trunks and boxes.” 

Surely there was danger of a torn skirt or 
an unexpected bang as they scurried hither 
and thither. The janitor was helping with 
trunks, big boxes, suit-cases. One girl had 


lost an umbrella, another gloves. Helen was 
amused at the disorder and confusion. 

By noon, much of it had cleared away. The 
gymnasium was filled with silent, ghost-like 
figures, the reading-room was vacant, with the 
chairs pushed primly under the tables. A few 
were lingering around with rather sober 
faces, gathering up last relics of four happy 
years. 

Leslie and Helen inspected the room and 
found it truly tempting. After some very 
frank consideration they decided to take it, and 
spent an hour or so removing their belongings. 
The porter carried the improvised bookcases 
and their contents. Everything would be 
swathed in wraps until September. 

“ But it is such a load off one’s mind,” said 
Leslie, with a sigh of content. “ Helen, I liked 
you the day you entered. You were such an 
honest-looking, big girl, with no sort of pre- 
tence. And everything about you indicated 
a girl who had come to study. But not a few 
do come for the fun and to make acquaint- 
ances they think will advance them. They are 
to be the women and the mothers of the next 



generation. I wonder if we are learning to 
live useful lives ! ” 

Helen glanced up silently, and thought with 
a pang of the sweet and useful life that lay 
before her, the pleasure she could give to the 
two elderly souls that had been so tender to 
her, that longed to take her into their very 
lives. 

“ It’s such a puzzle to know what is best — 
just right, I mean.” 

Leslie smiled. “ You have not come to any 
very serious problems yet. So far, it is doing 
the best one can, giving out a little happiness 
here and there, helping those who are in need 
and necessity, not those who have friends and 
blessings on every side, but the poor in heart 
as well as in purse. I am glad college has 
turned out some splendid missionary women. 
We can all be near-by missionaries,” and a 
sweet smile hovered over her face that made 
her really beautiful. 

Helen wondered if she was not a little hypo- 
critical. There was a great problem confront- 
ing her. Leslie Brooks had never had a lover, 
she had once said. Was she capable of judg- 


 

ing then? If all the world loved a lover, 
would she not range herself on the lover’s 
side ? 

She went back to her own deserted room. 
Lorraine was at home, the darling of her 
family. Helen had liked Mr. Denman a good 
deal. He was more of a business man and 
a man of the world than Mr. Bell, but he 
lacked some charm, that sort of poetical in- 
sight that had so won her. Willard, too, had 
very little of it; perhaps it was owing to a 
greater discrimination. 

Ah, how lonely the room looked. Had she 
been so really content here? There would be 
more beauty next year, a lovelier living than 
one girl alone could make. 

“ Is this the trunk?" inquired the porter. 
“ Suit-case, too," and putting one on the other, 
lifted them with his brawny arms. She picked 
up her umbrella and satchel and walked slowly 
down-stairs. The stage was waiting. Miss 
Van Meter and several of the last girls were 
in it. Leslie sat by her and her eyes expressed 
so much. Helen’s train came in a few mo- 



ments, and she said good-by with a choking 
voice. 

It was dusk of the June day when she 
reached Kingsland. Miss Craven was there 
with the carriage. 

“Oh, I am so glad to have you! It has 
been a whole year — ” 

“Oh, no! not ten months !” brightly, 
clasping both hands. 

“ But with Christmas counted out. I was 
afraid you might stand about the fever, but 
the worst is over, only she is so weak. She 
has been the sweetest little thing, however. I 
don’t know what I should do without those 
children, Helen. Life would seem devoid of 
interest. We need humanity, something out- 
side of ourselves.” 

Yes, her own life would be too small to 
hold her. She must outflow into others. A 
definite purpose was broadening and strength- 
ening her nature in spite of the repression of 
her earlier years. And now that Helen had 
seen more of girls and women, she knew it had 
taken courage to resist Mrs. Davis’s plans, not 


 

to drift, not to live uselessly, nor make wealth 
one of the gods of existence. 

They had a dainty little supper together, 
and then they went out on the vine-covered 
porch. The moon was very late now, past 
midnight, but the stars were innumerable in 
the broad sky. 

Yes, Helen had passed very successfully and 
was a senior. She had not tried for prizes, 
nor for any great honors. She was saving 
her energies for the incoming year. She 
would have a delightful roommate, a girl of 
her own standing in this world’s goods, who 
was an orphan like herself, who had been 
weighted with a great sorrow and borne it 
with much courage, who was staying now for 
a postgraduate course and meant sometime 
to work for a higher degree. And there was 
the odd, fascinating, impulsive girl lover and 
poet, that in some way suggested Daisy Bell. 

“ Poor girl. What a pity her life was so 
short when there was so much in it. Oh, do 
you remember the flare-up we all had about 
my Christmas visit to you ? I suppose she was 
charming; the girls adored her. But it 



seemed to me she wasn’t quite sincere, that 
she wanted more than she gave." 

“ We were never quite the same afterward, 
although she fancied she loved me very 
warmly. She was jealous, and I believe I 
can’t tolerate jealousy very well. You love 
one friend for several gifts and graces, but she 
may lack a few that some other friend pos- 
sesses in an eminent degree. You can’t love 
a person for what he or she does not pos- 
sess.” 

“ I met Mr. Duer about a month ago. He 
seemed one of the agreeable men that nothing 
touches very deeply. I hope he made her 
brief life happy.” 

“ It had all that money, variety, and hand- 
some attire could give. I cannot imagine 
Daisy being happy in poverty, even if a wealth 
of love was laid at her feet. It is odd, and I 
am afraid not quite kind, to be able to see the 
faults of your friends so plainly, but what 
then becomes of discrimination, experience, 
the capability of judging more correctly, that 
training does give you?” and Helen’s voice 
had a note of perplexity in it. 


 

“ You love your friends in spite of their 
faults. It is a good plan, I think, to look at 
the qualities you admire and that suit you, and 
let the others go. Why, Helen, I believe I 
learned that of you. You used to see the 
bright side of the girls at school, and you 
never were captious.” 

“ There were so many bright sides,” and 
now the voice had a soft ring in it that bor- 
dered on a laugh. “ And I liked Daisy very 
much at first. She was what people call win- 
some. She had the power of appealing to you, 
of drawing you to her as if she needed you. 
It was very sweet. But one can't need so 
many, so you would be sort of dropped for 
awhile and she would flit to some other flower. 
But you must keep her place until she came 
back; you must not take in another.” 

“ Yes. I know that.” 

“ She wanted all. I wonder if I am volatile. 
I like so many people, women and girls. Still 
there are only a few that I like supremely, 
that I trust and accept without a question. I 
wish you knew Miss Brooks.” 

“ Well, invite her here. You must ask any 


friend. You accept so little, Helen,” rather 
regretfully. 

“ I have accepted the home and the home 
feeling,” Helen replied with a sweet solem- 
nity. “ And when I come to want and trouble 
I shall make a rush to you. Why, a dozen 
things may happen before I am sixty; you 
may some day have a helpless, nervous, queer 
old maid on your hands who has been 
smashed up in a railroad accident — ” 

“Oh, don't! don’t! I’m glad to hear you 
say it, though. That is the real point of 
friendship to which I would like to attain. I 
shall never be jealous. I’d like half a dozen 
girls about, and I am almost impatient for 
these two little ones to grow up ; yet childhood 
is so sweet.” 

“ Don’t you mean ever to marry? ” 

“ I have taken no vow against it. I am 
learning a good many things about the world, 
about people. What an awful ignoramus I 
was! I can’t see how you came to — ” 

“ You interested me,” interrupted Helen. 
“And then you had no near family ties; 
neither had I. Oh, there were many things! ” 


 

“ Thank you for discovering them. But I 
do feel interested in your friends. I can imag- 
ine Miss Brooks, but that little poet who writes 
verses to you — I do really want to see her. 
If she was an orphan, now — ” 

“ Oh, you will end by being a regular 
orphan asylum! And my ideal is a school like 
Aldred House.” 


CHAPTER XI 


THROUGH PATHS SUNNY AND SHADY 

For a few clays Helen simply revelled in 
rest and delight. The letter from Willard was 
full of disappointment, but everything would 
be made up to him when he returned and found 
her in the dear old home. She wrote to Mrs. 
Bell, explaining the little delay, that her friend 
had a claim on her, that there was shopping 
and dressmaking. She felt conscience-smitten ; 
it seemed as if she was not quite honest with 
anybody. A dozen times she resolved to talk 
the matter over with Juliet and then her cour- 
age failed her. She knew that she had been 
secretly hoping Willard’s fancy would be at- 
tracted elsewhere, and she could be a daughter 
of the house in simple adoption. Was she un- 
grateful when so many joined to render her 

happy; give her of their best? 

 


Elma improved, and was carried down-stairs 
a part of each day, and later taken out to 
drive. She looked very delicate and it brought 
back the old time of her accident. Helen 
thought more than once if the fates had been 
different, if Juliet had met Mr. Gartney as a 
marriageable man — but then, the children 
would not have been sent to school and they 
would never have met. She laughed at her 
own turn for romances, and the thought of 
marrying off her friends — “ while I don’t 
even want lovers myself,” she said in a berat- 
ing sort of fashion. 

She let the days go on. She would not 
think; she walked and drove through beauti- 
ful ways; she swung in the hammock to the 
music of birds and the murmur of the fragrant 
air ; she read verses aloud ; she told over col- 
lege episodes, and all the while one dear face 
haunted her, a tender, fatherly face, and she 
could hear the words of welcome, “ In Daisy's 
place.” She must make up to these elderly 
people what they had lost. Oh, she must! 
She could not be so cruel as to thrust aside 
this longing love. 



“ I must go early next week,” she said to 
herself, standing on the wide porch in the 
morning sunshine, breathing in the fragrant 
air. “ It is the thing to do, to accept. I sup- 
pose love will come. There is no one else, I 
have not even fancied what my hero would be 
like. And Willard has made a fine man of 
himself; any girl might be proud of him. I 
wonder what the hardness about me can be! 
Perhaps I am a little like father, but I must 
strive to conquer it. If I have been weak 
enough to drift into it, blind enough not to 
discriminate between love and friendship, I 
must pay the penalty. There will be a whole 
year — ” 

A messenger boy was running up the drive 
with a yellow envelope in his hand. 

“ Miss Helen Grant,” he ejaculated breath- 
lessly. She tore off the end. 

“ Father died suddenly Wednesday night. 
I reached home this morning. Come to us at 
once. 

“ Willard Bell.” 


 


Helen stood stunned. Just as she was think- 
ing, resolving, for his dear sake ! All the 
world about her seemed blurred, and a shiver 
sped through every nerve. 

‘‘Helen, what is it? You look like a 
ghost." 

She held the telegram before Juliet. 

“ Oh, what a sad, dreadful thing! Yes, you 
must go. What can I do to help you? Had 
Mr. Bell been in ill health?" 

“ Not that I know of." Her voice was 
tremulous. 

Then they glanced into each other’s eyes. 
Was a secret half-suspected, half-confessed? 
Juliet kissed her tenderly, looked up trains, 
ordered the carriage, and was soon driving 
her down to the station. 

Helen still seemed dazed, incredulous. How 
could it be ! She had never dreamed of such 
an event, though she had felt anxious about 
Mrs. Bell. How would she bear this second 
stroke I 

Willard came to meet her, grave, and yet 
so sweet that her heart smote her. Oh, any 



other girl would love him, must love him! It 
was her duty now to try. 

“ Father hasn’t been quite up to the mark 
in some time, mother thinks. You see he 
missed her a great deal in the winter. They 
had never been separated for more than a 
week or two. And he was worried about 
Daisy. She had everything, to be sure ” — 
he made a little halt — “ but Duel* wasn’t the 
kind of man she should have married. He 
was all for pleasure and excitement, and it 
wore her out. Father had not complained 
any, but he didn’t seem to care so much about 
the garden as he used. He would sit and read 
to mother; you know how fond he was of 
those simple little poems. When he came 
home that afternoon he lay on the lounge 
awhile, then he asked mother to go to drive. 
After supper he sat in his big easy chair by 
the window. A woman had been there doing 
some work, and she was pouring her wants 
and woes in mother’s ears. She went to look 
up some clothing for the poor body, and when 
she came in the room she thought father 
asleep, and would not disturb him. So it 


 

was nearly nine when she spoke to him, and 
she couldn’t believe at first. Some one hur- 
ried for the doctor, but she knew in a few 
moments that he was beyond earthly help. I 
hadn’t expected to return quite so soon and 
must go back again. Both girls came up this 
morning ; they were there when I reached 
home. I sent the message at once. Oh, 
Helen! I am so glad you came. You were 
so dear to him; Daisy hadn’t a friend he 
cared so much about, and he was very fond 
of young girls. All our misfortunes seem to
