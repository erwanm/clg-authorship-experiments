ever known a single one of them to do anything as violent as the
thing they had all suffered?

But more than anything else Peter was troubled by fear. Peter, the
ant, perceived the conflict of the giants becoming more ferocious,
and realized the precariousness of his position under the giants’
feet. The passions of both sides were mounting, and the fiercer
their hate became, the greater the chance of Peter’s being
discovered, the more dreadful his fate if he were discovered. It was
all very well for McGivney to assure him that only four of Guffey’s
men knew the truth, and that all these might be trusted to the
death. Peter remembered a remark he had heard Shawn Grady make, and
which had caused him to lose his appetite for more than one meal.
“They’ve got spies among us,” the young Irishman had said. “Well,
sooner or later we’ll do a bit of spying of our own!”

And now these words came back to Peter like a voice from the grave.
Suppose one of the Reds who had money were to hire somebody to get a
job in Guffey’s office! Suppose some Red girl were to try Peter’s
device, and seduce one of Guffey’s men--by no means a difficult
task! The man mightn’t even mean to reveal that Peter Gudge was a
secret agent; he might just let it slip, as little Jennie had let
slip the truth about Jack Ibbetts! Thus Mac would know who had
framed him up; and what would Mac do to Peter when he got out on
bail? When Peter thought of things like that he realized what it
meant to go to war; he saw that he had gained nothing by staying at
home, he might as well have been in the front-line trenches! After
all, this was war, class-war; and in all war the penalty for spying
is death.

Also Peter was worried about Nell. She had been in her new position
for nearly a week, and he hadn’t heard a word from her. She had
forbidden him to write, for fear he might write something
injudicious. Let him just wait, Edythe Eustace would know how to
take care of herself. And that was all right, Peter had no doubt
about the ability of Edythe Eustace to take care of herself. What
troubled him was the knowledge that she was working on another
“frame-up,” and he stood in fear of the exuberance of her
imagination. The last time that imagination had been pregnant, it
had presented him with a suit-case full of dynamite. What it might
bring forth next time he did not know, and was afraid to think. Nell
might cause him to be found out by Guffey; and that would be nearly
as horrible as to be found out by Mac!

Peter got his morning “Times,” and found a whole page about the
whipping of the Reds, portraying the job as a patriotic duty
heroically performed; and that naturally cheered Peter up
considerably. He turned to the editorial page, and read a two column
“leader” that was one whoop of exultation. It served still more to
cure Peter’s ache of conscience; and when he read on and found a
series of interviews with leading citizens, giving cordial
endorsement to the acts of the “vigilantes,” Peter became ashamed of
his weakness, and glad that he had not revealed it to anyone. Peter
was trying his best to become a real “he-man,” a 100% red-blooded
American, and he had the “Times” twice each day, morning and
evening, to guide, sustain and inspire him.

Peter had been told by McGivney to fix himself up and pose as one of
the martyrs of the night’s affair, and this appealed to his sense of
humor. He cut off the hair from a part of his head, and stuck some
raw cotton on top, and plastered it over with surgical tape. He
stuck another big wad of surgical tape across his forehead, and a
criss-cross of it on his cheek, and tied up his wrist in an
excellent imitation of a sprain. Thus rigged out he repaired to the
American House, and McGivney rewarded him with a hearty laugh, and
then proceeded to give some instructions which, entirely restored
Peter’s usual freshness of soul. Peter was going up on Mount Olympus
again!

The rat-faced man explained in detail. There was a lady of great
wealth--indeed, she was said to be several times a millionaire--who
was an openly avowed Red, a pacifist of the most malignant variety.
Since the arrest of young Lackman she had come forward and put up
funds to finance the “People’s Council,” and the “Anti-Conscription
League,” and all the other activities which for the sake of
convenience were described by the term “pro-German.” The only
trouble was this lady was so extremely wealthy it was hard to do
anything to her. Her husband was a director in a couple of Nelse
Ackerman’s banks, and had other powerful connections. The husband
was a violent, anti-Socialist, and a buyer of liberty bonds; he
quarrelled with his wife, but nevertheless he did not want to see
her in jail, and this made an embarrassing situation for the police
and the district attorney’s office, and even for the Federal
authorities, who naturally did not want to trouble one of the
courtiers of the king of American City. “But something’s got to be
done,” said McGivney. “This camouflaged German propaganda can’t go
on.” So Peter was to try to draw Mrs. Godd into some kind of “overt
action.”

“Mrs. Godd?” said Peter. It seemed to him a singular coincidence
that one of the dwellers on Mount Olympus should bear that name. The
great lady lived on a hilltop out in the suburbs, not so far from
the hilltop of Nelse Ackerman. One of the adventures looked forward
to by Reds and pacifists in distress was to make a pilgrimage to
this palace and obtain some long, green plasters to put over their
wounds. Now was the time at all times for Peter to go, said
McGivney. Peter had many wounds to be plastered, and Mrs. Godd would
be indignant at the proceedings of last night, and would no doubt
express herself without restraint.




Section 62


Peter hadn’t been so excited since the time when he had waited to
meet young Lackman. He had never quite forgiven himself for this
costly failure, and now he was to have another chance. He took a
trolley ride out into the country, and walked a couple of miles to
the palace on the hilltop, and mounted thru a grove of trees and
magnificent Italian gardens. According to McGivney’s injunctions, he
summoned his courage, and went to the front door of the stately
mansion and rang the bell.

Peter was hot and dusty from his long walk, the sweat had made
streaks down his face and marred the pristine whiteness of his
plasters. He was never a distinguished-looking person at best, and
now, holding his damaged straw hat in his hands, he looked not so
far from a hobo. However, the French maid who came to the door was
evidently accustomed to strange-looking visitors. She didn’t order
Peter to the servant’s entrance, nor threaten him with the dogs; she
merely said, “Be seated, please. I will tell madame”--putting the
accent on the second syllable, where Peter had never heard it
before.

And presently here came Mrs. Godd in her cloud of Olympian
beneficence; a large and ample lady, especially built for the role
of divinity. Peter felt suddenly awe-stricken. How had he dared come
here? Neither in the Hotel de Soto, with its many divinities, nor in
the palace of Nelse Ackerman, the king, had he felt such a sense of
his own lowliness as the sight of this calm, slow-moving great lady
inspired. She was the embodiment of opulence, she was “the real
thing.” Despite the look of kindliness in her wide-open blue eyes,
she impressed him with a feeling of her overwhelming superiority. He
did not know it was his duty as a gentleman to rise from his chair
when a lady entered, but some instinct brought him to his feet and
caused him to stand blinking as she crossed to him from the opposite
end of the big room.

“How do you do?” she said in a low, full voice, gazing at him
steadily out of the kind, wide-open blue eyes. Peter stammered, “How
d-dy do, M--Mrs. Godd.”

In truth, Peter was almost dumb with bewilderment. Could it really,
possibly be that this grand personage was a Red? One of the things
that had most offended him about all radicals was their noisiness,
their aggressiveness; but here was a grand serenity of looks and
manner, a soft, slow voice--here was beauty, too, a skin unlined,
despite middle years, and glowing with health and a fine cleanness.
Nell Doolin had had a glowing complexion, but there was always a lot
of powder stuck on, and when you investigated closely, as Peter had
done, you discovered muddy spots in the edges of her hair and on her
throat. But Mrs. Godd’s skin shone just as the skin of a goddess
would be expected to shine, and everything about her was of a divine
and compelling opulence. Peter could not have explained just what it
was that gave this last impression so overwhelmingly. It was not
that she wore many jewels, or large ones, for Mrs. James had beaten
her at that; it was not her delicate perfume, for Nell Doolin
scattered more sweetness on the air; yet somehow even poor, ignorant
Peter felt the difference--it seemed to him that none of Mrs. Godd’s
costly garments had ever been worn before, that the costly rugs on
the floor had never been stepped on before, the very chair on which
he sat had never been sat on before!

Little Ada Ruth had called Mrs. Godd “the mother of all the world;”
 and now suddenly she became the mother of Peter Gudge. She had read
the papers that morning, she had received a half dozen telephone
calls from horrified and indignant Reds, and so a few words sufficed
to explain to her the meaning of Peter’s bandages and plasters. She
held out to him a beautiful cool hand, and quite without warning,
tears sprang into the great blue eyes.

“Oh, you are one of those poor boys! Thank God they did not kill
you!” And she led him to a soft couch and made him lie down amid
silken pillows. Peter’s dream of Mount Olympus had come literally
true! It occurred to him that if Mrs. Godd were willing to play
permanently the role of mother to Peter Gudge, he would be willing
to give up his role of anti-Red agent with its perils and its
nervous strains; he would forget duty, forget the world’s strife and
care; he would join the lotus-eaters, the sippers of nectar on Mount
Olympus!

She sat and talked to him in the soft, gentle voice, and the kind
blue eyes watched him, and Peter thought that never in all his life
had he encountered such heavenly emotions. To be sure, when he had
gone to see Miriam Yankovich, old Mrs. Yankovich had been just as
kind, and tears of sympathy had come into her eyes just the same.
But then, Mrs. Yankovich was nothing but a fat old Jewess, who lived
in a tenement and smelt of laundry soap and partly completed
washing; her hands had been hot and slimy, and so Peter had not been
in the least grateful for her kindness. But to encounter tender
emotions in these celestial regions, to be talked to maternally and
confidentially by this wonderful Mrs. Godd in soft white chiffons
just out of a band-box this was quite another matter!




Section 63


Peter did not want to set traps for this mother of Mount Olympus, he
didn’t want to worm any secrets from her. And as it happened, he
found that he did not have to, because she told him everything right
away, and without the slightest hesitation. She talked just as the
“wobblies” had talked in their headquarters; and Peter, when he
thought it over, realized that there are two kinds of people who can
afford to be frank in their utterance--those who have nothing to
lose, and those who have so much to lose that they cannot possibly
lose it.

Mrs. Godd said that what had been done to those men last night was a
crime, and it ought to be punished if ever a crime was punished, and
that she would like to engage detectives and get evidence against
the guilty ones. She said furthermore that she sympathized with the
Reds of the very reddest shade, and if there were any color redder
than Red she would be of that color. She said all this in her quiet,
soft voice. Tears came into her eyes now and then, but they were
well-behaved tears, they disappeared of their own accord, and
without any injury to Mrs. Godd’s complexion, or any apparent effect
upon her self-possession.

Mrs. Godd said that she didn’t see how anybody could fail to be a
Red who thought about the injustices of present-day society. Only a
few days before she had been in to see the district attorney, and
had tried to make a Red out of him! Then she told Peter how there
had come to see her a man who had pretended to be a radical, but she
had realized that he didn’t know anything about radicalism, and had
told him she was sure he was a government agent. The man had finally
admitted it, and showed her his gold star--and then Mrs. Godd had
set to work to convert him! She had argued with him for an hour or
two, and then had invited him to go to the opera with her. “And do
you know,” said Mrs. Godd, in an injured tone, “he wouldn’t go! They
don’t want to be converted, those men; they don’t want to listen to
reason. I believe the man was actually afraid I might influence
him.”

“I shouldn’t wonder,” put in Peter, sympathetically; for he was a
tiny bit afraid himself.

“I said to him, `Here I live in this palace, and back in the
industrial quarter of the city are several thousand men and women
who slave at machines for me all day, and now, since the war, all
night too. I get the profits of these peoples’ toil--and what have I
done to earn it? Absolutely nothing! I never did a stroke of useful
work in my life.’ And he said to me, `Suppose the dividends were to
stop, what would you do?’ ‘I don’t know what I’d do,’ I answered,
`I’d be miserable, of course, because I hate poverty, I couldn’t
stand it, it’s terrible to think of--not to have comfort and
cleanliness and security. I don’t see how the working-class stand
it--that’s exactly why I’m a Red, I know it’s wrong for anyone to be
poor, and there’s no excuse for it. So I shall help to overthrow the
capitalist system, even if it means I have to take in washing for my
living!”

Peter sat watching her in the crisp freshness of her snowy chiffons.
The words brought a horrible image to his mind; he suddenly found
himself back in the tenement kitchen, where fat and steaming Mrs.
Yankovich was laboring elbow deep in soap-suds. It was on the tip of
Peter’s tongue to say: “If you really had done a day’s washing, Mrs.
Godd, you wouldn’t talk like that!”

But he remembered that he must play the game, so he said, “They’re
terrible fellows, them Federal agents. It was two of them pounded me
over the head last night.” And then he looked faint and pitiful, and
Mrs. Godd was sympathetic again, and moved to more recklessness of
utterance.

“It’s because of this hideous war!” she declared. “We’ve gone to war
to make the world safe for democracy, and meantime we have to
sacrifice every bit of democracy at home. They tell you that you
must hold your peace while they murder one another, but they may try
all they please, they’ll never be able to silence me! I know that
the Allies are just as much to blame as the Germans, I know that
this is a war of profiteers and bankers; they may take my sons and
force them into the army, but they cannot take my convictions and
force them into their army. I am a pacifist, and I am an
internationalist; I want to see the workers arise and turn out of
office these capitalist governments, and put an end to this hideous
slaughter of human beings. I intend to go on saying that so long as
I live.” There sat Mrs. Godd, with her lovely firm white hands
clasped as if in prayer, one large diamond ring on the left fourth
finger shining defiance, and a look of calm, child-like conviction
upon her face, confronting in her imagination all the federal agents
and district attorneys and capitalist judges and statesmen and
generals and drill sergeants in the civilized world.

She went on to tell how she had attended the trial of three pacifist
clergymen a week or two previously. How atrocious that Christians in
a Christian country should be sent to prison for trying to repeat
the words of Christ! “I was so indignant,” declared Mrs. Godd, “that
I wrote a letter to the judge. My husband said I would be committing
contempt of court by writing to a judge during the trial, but I
answered that my contempt for that court was beyond anything I could
put into writing. Wait--”

And Mrs. Godd rose gravely from her chair and went over to a desk by
the wall, and got a copy of the letter. “I’ll read it to you,” she
said, and Peter listened to a manifesto of Olympian Bolshevism--

To His Honor:

As I entered the sanctuary, I gazed upward to the stained glass
dome, upon which were inscribed four words: Peace. Justice. Truth.
Law--and I felt hopeful. Before me were men who had violated no
constitutional right, who had not the slightest criminal tendency,
who, were opposed to violence of every kind.

The trial proceeded. I looked again at the beautiful stained glass
dome, and whispered to myself those majestic-sounding words: “Peace.
Justice. Truth. Law.” I listened to the prosecutors; the Law in
their hands was a hard, sharp, cruel blade, seeking insistently,
relentlessly for a weak spot in the armor of its victims. I listened
to their Truth, and it was Falsehood. Their Peace was a cruel and
bloody War. Their justice was a net to catch the victims at any
cost--at the cost of all things but the glory of the Prosecutor’s
office.

I grew sick at heart. I can only ask myself the old, old question:
What can we, the people do? How can we bring Peace, justice, Truth
and Law to the world? Must we go on bended knees and ask our public
servants to see that justice is done to the defenceless, rather than
this eternal prosecuting of the world’s noblest souls! You will find
these men guilty, and sentence them to be shut behind iron
bars--which should never be for human beings, no matter what their
crime, unless you want to make beasts of them. Is that your object,
sir? It would seem so; and so I say that we must overturn the system
that is brutalizing, rather than helping and uplifting mankind.

Yours for Peace..Justice..Truth..Law--

Mary Angelica Godd.

What were you going to do with such a woman? Peter could understand
the bewilderment of His Honor, and of the district attorney’s
office, and of the secret service department of the Traction
Trust--as well as of Mrs. Godd’s husband! Peter was bewildered
himself; what was the use of his coming out here to get more
information, when Mrs. Godd had already committed contempt of court
in writing, and had given all the information there was to give to a
Federal agent? She had told this man that she had contributed
several thousand dollars to the Peoples’ Council, and that she
intended to contribute more. She had put up bail for a whole bunch
of Reds and Pacifists, and she intended to put up bail for McCormick
and his friends, just as soon as the corrupt capitalist courts had
been forced to admit them to bail. “I know McCormick well, and he’s
a lovely boy,” she said. “I don’t believe he had anything more to do
with dynamite bombs than I have.”

Now all this time Peter had sat there, entirely under the spell of
Mrs. Godd’s opulence. Peter was dwelling among the lotus-eaters, and
forgetting the world’s strife and care; he was reclining on a silken
couch, sipping nectar with the shining ones of Mount Olympus. But
now suddenly, Peter was brought back to duty, as one wakes from a
dream to the sound of an alarm-clock. Mrs. Godd was a friend of
Mac’s, Mrs. Godd proposed to get Mac out on bail! Mac, the most
dangerous Red of them all! Peter saw that he must get something on
this woman at once!




Section 64


Peter sat up suddenly among his silken cushions, and began to tell
Mrs. Godd about the new plan of the Anti-conscription League, to
prepare a set of instructions for young conscientious objectors.
Peter represented the purpose of these instructions to be the
advising of young men as to their legal and constitutional rights.
But it was McGivney’s idea that Peter should slip into the
instructions some phrase advising the young men to refuse military
duty; if this were printed and circulated, it would render every
member of the Anti-conscription League liable to a sentence of ten
or twenty years in jail. McGivney had warned Peter to be very
cautious about this, but again Peter found that there was no need of
caution. Mrs. Godd was perfectly willing to advise young men to
refuse military service. She had advised many such, she said,
including her own sons, who unfortunately agreed with their father
in being blood-thirsty.

It came to be lunch-time, and Mrs. Godd asked if Peter could sit at
table--and Peter’s curiosity got the better of all caution. He
wanted to see the Godd family sipping their nectar out of golden
cups. He wondered, would the disapproving husband and the
blood-thirsty sons be present?

There was nobody present but an elderly woman companion, and Peter
did not see any golden cups. But he saw some fine china, so fragile
that he was afraid to touch it, and he saw a row of silver
implements, so heavy that it gave him a surprise each time he picked
one up. Also, he saw foods prepared in strange and complicated ways,
so chopped up and covered with sauces that it was literally true he
couldn’t give the name of a single thing he had eaten, except the
buttered toast.

He was inwardly quaking with embarrassment during this meal, but he
saved himself by Mrs. James’s formula, to watch and see what the
others were doing and then do likewise. Each time a new course was
brought, Peter would wait, and when he saw Mrs. Godd pick up a
certain fork or a certain spoon, he would pick up the same one, or
as near to it as he could guess. He could put his whole mind on
this, because he didn’t have to do any talking; Mrs. Godd poured out
a steady stream of sedition and high treason, and all Peter had to
do was to listen and nod. Mrs. Godd would understand that his mouth
was too full for utterance.

After the luncheon they went out on the broad veranda which
overlooked a magnificent landscape. The hostess got Peter settled in
a soft porch chair with many cushions, and then waved her hand
toward the view of the city with its haze of thick black smoke.

“That’s where my wage slaves toil to earn my dividends,” said she.
“They’re supposed to stay there--in their `place,’ as it’s called,
and I stay here in my place. If they want to change places, it’s
called `revolution,’ and that is `violence.’ What I marvel at is
that they use so little violence, and feel so little. Look at those
men being tortured in jail! Could anyone blame them if they used
violence? Or if they made an effort to escape?”

That suggested a swift, stabbing idea to Peter. Suppose Mrs. Godd
could be induced to help in a jail delivery!

“It might be possible to help them to escape,” he suggested.

“Do you think so?” asked Mrs. Godd, showing excitement for the
first time during that interview.

“It might be,” said Peter. “Those jailors are not above taking
bribes, you know. I met nearly all of them while I was in that jail,
and I think I might get in touch with one or two that could be paid.
Would you like me to try it?”

“Well, I don’t know--” began the lady, hesitatingly. “Do you really
think--”

“You know they never ought to have been put in at all!” Peter
interjected.

“That’s certainly true!” declared Mrs. Godd.

“And if they could escape without hurting anyone, if they didn’t
have to fight the jailors, it wouldn’t do any real harm--”

That was as far as Peter got with his impromptu conspiracy. Suddenly
he heard a voice behind him: “What does this mean?” It was a male
voice, fierce and trembling with anger; and Peter started from his
silken cushions, and glanced around, thrusting up one arm with the
defensive gesture of a person who has been beaten since earliest
childhood.

Bearing down on him was a man; possibly he was not an abnormally big
man, but certainly he looked so to Peter. His smooth-shaven face was
pink with anger, his brows gathered in a terrible frown, and his
hands clenched with deadly significance. “You dirty little skunk!”
 he hissed. “You infernal young sneak!”

“John!” cried Mrs. Godd, imperiously; but she might as well have
cried to an advancing thunder-storm. The man made a leap upon Peter,
and Peter, who had dodged many hundreds of blows in his lifetime,
rolled off the lounging chair, and leaped to his feet, and started
for the stairs of the veranda. The man was right behind him, and as
Peter reached the first stair the man’s foot shot out, and caught
Peter fairly in the seat of his trousers, and the first stair was
the only one of the ten or twelve stairs of the veranda that Peter
touched in his descent.

Landing at the bottom, he did not stop even for a glance; he could
hear the snorting of Mr. Godd, it seemed right behind his ear, and
Peter ran down the driveway as he had seldom run in his life before.
Every now and then Mr. Godd would shoot out another kick, but he had
to stop slightly to do this, and Peter gained just enough to keep
the kicks from reaching him. So at last the pursuer gave up, and
Peter dashed thru the gates of the Godd estate and onto the main
highway.

Then he looked over his shoulder, and seeing that Mr. Godd was a
safe distance away, he stopped and turned and shook his clenched
fist with the menace of a street-rat, shrieking, “Damn you! Damn
you!” A whirlwind of impotent rage laid hold upon him. He shouted
more curses and menaces, and among them some strange, some almost
incredible words. “Yes, I’m a Red, damn your soul, and I’ll stay a
Red!”

Yes, Peter Gudge, the friend of law and order, Peter Gudge, the
little brother to the rich, shouted, “I’m a Red, and what’s more,
we’ll blow you up some day for this--Mac and me’ll put a bomb under
you!” Mr. Godd turned and stalked with contemptuous dignity back to
his own private domestic controversy.

Peter walked off down the road, rubbing his sore trousers and
sobbing to himself. Yes, Peter understood now exactly how the Reds
felt. Here were these rich parasites, exploiting the labor of
working men and living off in palaces by themselves--and what had
they done to earn it? What would they ever do for the poor man,
except to despise him, and to kick him in the seat of his trousers?
They were a set of wilful brutes! Peter suddenly saw the happenings
of last night from a new angle, and wished he had all the younger
members of the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants’ and
