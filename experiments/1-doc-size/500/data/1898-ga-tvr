Suddenly Roldan became conscious 
that the wiry little body between his 
gripping knees had relaxed somewhat the 
tension of its muscles. Was the poor 
brute collapsing? Roldan leaned over 
and patted his neck. It responded for a 
moment, then fell back again. Roldan 
set his lips. As he did so he cast about 



 

him the instinctive glance of those in 
peril. A huge log was bearing down 
upon him like a projectile. 

In a second his feet were out of his stir 
rups and he was crouching on the mus 
tang's back. The losf struck the beast 

full in the side, tossing Roldan as if he had 
been a feather. The mustang gave a 
hoarse neigh, unheard above the roar of 
the water. 

Roldan, keeping his face from the 
pounding waves as best he could, struck 
out for the bank. But the current was 
too much for his slender body, plucky as 
it was. He made a mighty effort and 
shouted, 

"Adan!" 

The high clear note pierced to his com 
panion's ear. Adan turned his head, 
uttered a cry, and pulled his unwilling 
mustang about. But the current was 
carrying the white face on the waves 
rapidly past. 

"Lariat!" Roldan managed to scream. 

Adan's faculties had been paralysed for 
the moment, but they responded almost 



 

automatically to that imperious will. He 
unwound the lariat rapidly from the pom 
mel, hastily gathered the loops, then flung 
it with sure hand straight at his friend. 
It fell about Roldan's neck. The boy 
jerked it over his shoulders, then signed 
to A dan to proceed. 

A clan once more urged his horse for 
ward, not daring to look behind. Roldan 
made no attempt to swim; he merely 
used his arms to keep his head above 
water. There were but a few yards farther. 
The mustang, despite his double load, 
made them, and scrambled up the bank. 
Adan, realising for the first time that 
he was stiff with cold, scrambled off and 
pulled in the rope with hands that were 
aching and almost numb. He heard 
Roldan strike the bank, a moment later 
the snapping of brush. Roldan's head 
rose into view, Adan gave a last despair 
ing tug, and a moment later the two boys 
lay on their backs, panting for breath. 



" DO you want any more adventures?" 
 asked Adan feebly, after a time. 

" Not at present," said Roldan. 

He raised himself stiffly. "Come," he 
said, " this will never do. We shall both 
have rheumatism. We must have a fire 
at once." 

Adan groaned pathetically, but got on 
his feet. They had found refuge in the 
open ; but a grove of trees was near, and 
in a quarter of an hour they had piled a 
heap of branches and chaparral as high as 
an Indian pyre, hunted up two pieces of 
flint, and sent sparks flying through the 
dry mass. 

The boys divested themselves of their 
dripping clothes and hung them close to 
the fire, then raced up and down with 
what energy was left in them to scotch 
the chill night air. Finally they paused 

breathless before the pile, which was now 
roaring merrily. 

" I should like to know what we are 
to have for supper," said Roldan. " That 
Mission is twenty miles away, and I for 
one can't walk to it. Climb up a tree 
and see if there is a light anywhere." 

" Thanks, senor," said Adan, " when my 
clothes are dry." 

" True, we must keep our skin. I have 
it ! " He sprang on the back of the mus 
tang, who also had fallen upon reach 
ing the shore but had risen to nibble for 
supper, and stood on the tips of his feet 
" I can see well," he announced. " But all 
the same I can see nothing. We must 
stay here." 

He dismounted, and relieving the mus 
tang of the heavy saddle, emptied the bags. 
" The bread and sweets are soaked," he 
said, " not fit for a pig to eat ; but we can 
do something with the meat. Fetch some 
coals." 

Adan with infinite difficulty managed to 
scrape a few  apart from the bonfire, 
and over this they scorched the meat. As 



 

they crouched on the ground they looked 
like two little white savages, and they were 
neither comfortable nor happy. 

" We must keep this fire going all night," 
said Roldan, " or we shall be eaten by bears, 
to say nothing of rattlesnakes " 

" Hist ! " whispered Adan. " I hear one." 
Both boys sprang to their feet. 

" Where ? " 

" Near the horse." 

Roldan seized his pistol and ran in the 
direction indicated, keeping his eyes on 
the ground. Suddenly he paused. Some 
thing just beyond the light was growing 
into a series of graceful loops. A long 
neck slowly lifted itself and two baleful 
eyes fixed upon Roldan. He raised his 
pistol, and the rattler was beheaded as 
neatly as if it were stuffed and dismem 
bered with a pen knife. It shot out to full 
length, and the clever marksman took it by 
its horny tail and dragged it to the fire. 

" He didn't know that we'd have him 
for supper," said Adan, gleefully. " Here, 
let us eat our steak and then I'll skin 
him." 



 

The steak proved tough, and when it 
had been disposed of with many grum 
blings, the rattlesnake was skinned and 
roasted, and proved very delicate and 
edible. 

" Now," said Rolclan, " we must sleep." 

Their clothes being dry they dressed ; 
and after inspecting with a torch a circle 
of about two hundred yards to see that 
there were no snake holes, they built a hasty 
ring of chaparral, set fire to it that beasts 
and reptiles should keep their distance, 
then lay down and slept. Roldan was al 
ways a light sleeper, and with the fire on 
his mind awoke every few hours and 
gathered fresh chaparral or roused the 
heavier Adan. Coyotes wailed in the 
distance, and once as Roldan gathered brush 
he heard again the deadly rattle. But 
they were not disturbed, and even the 
skies were kind, for although clouds 
gathered, they passed. 

They awoke in the morning, fresh and 
vigorous but also hungry ; and there 
was little to eat. 

* I don't think I should fancy 
rattlesnake for breakfast,* said Roldan, and 
Adan shuddered at the mere thought. 
They cooked a small piece of meat, all 
that was left of their store, and it but 
whetted their appetite. 

" There's only one thing to do," said 
Roldan, " and that is to get to the Mission 
as quickly as possible. Chocolate ! Beans ! 
possibly chicken ! Think of it. Come ! 
Come!" 

Adan scrambled to his feet and saddled 
the mustang. It was agreed that they 
should ride him by turns, the other 
running at a brisk trot. 

The sun was barely up when they 
started. A light mist lay on the turbu 
lent waters and puffed among the sweet- 
scented chaparral. Roldan rode during the 
first hour, Adan running ahead, his glance 
darting from right to left, but encounter 
ing eyes neither malignant nor savage. 
Shortly after he mounted the horse the 
mist lifted and rolled back to the ocean. 
They had left the chaparral some time 
before and now discovered that they were 
in an open plain. In the distance were 



 

high hills over which wound a white trail. 
Between these hills and the travellers 
was a moving mass of something. Adan 
reined in suddenly. 

" Roldan," he said, " are those horses ? 
You have the longer sight." 

Roldan made a funnel of his hand. 
" Surely, surely ! " he cried. " What luck ! 
I hate walking. They are probably wild, 
but I never saw the mustang I could not 
lasso." 

" Yes, you can do the lassoing," said 
Adan, grimly. " My thumb nearly went 
off last night, and is twice its size." 

" Adan," said his friend, laying his hand 
on his comrade's knee. " I haven't 
thanked you. I haven't mentioned it ; but 
it is because well I lay awake an hour 
last night trying to think of something to 
say and and thinking that I loved 
you better than my own brothers " 

" That will do, then," said Adan, gruffly. 
" We'll be kissing each other in a minute 
as we did at the Hacienda Perez ; and I 
think that we are getting too big for that. 
I hear that American boys never kiss each 
other." 



 

"Don't they? "asked Roldan, pricking 
up his ears. " How I should like to know- 
some American boys. They must know 
so many things that we do not. Who 
told you?" 

" Antonio Scarpia has been in America, 
you know in Boston. He came back 
last month and rode over a few days ago 
for the night. I asked him many ques 
tions. He says they never show any 
feeling except when they get mad, and 
that they walk and row and play ball 
with the feet, caramba ! and run about 
in the snow. He says they would think 
we were like girls with our fine clothes 
and our hammocks " 

"Girls!" cried Roldan, indignantly. 
" I'd like to see American or any other 
boys do better with that bear than we did, 
or lasso a friend in the midst of a boiling 
river as you did. And if they come here 
to laugh at us they'll find one pair of fists 
that are not soft if they do have lace 
ruffles over them. And I'd like to see 
them live all day on a horse as we do."

" True, true, you are always right," said 


Adan, soothingly. u Ay, I think those 
horses are coming this way. Better get up. 

He moved back onto the aquera and 
Roldan sprang to his place and unwound 
the lariat. Like all of its kind, it was a 
slender woven cord about eighteen feet in 
length and made of tough strips of untanned hide. 
It was an admirable weapon 
in skilled hands, but not to be trifled with by 
the amateur. Many a careless Californian 
had lost a finger or thumb, and more than 
one had owed it lockjaw. 

The wild horses advanced rapidly for a 
time, but when they saw that the brother 
to which curiosity had attracted them was 
apparently of an eccentric build they sud 
denly paused and scattered. Roldan 
raised the bridle and dashed in pursuit; 
but the others were unincumbered, fleet of 
foot and terrified. They fled like the 
wind. 

"Drop off!" commanded Roldan, reining 
in. "Quick! I will have one." 

Adan slid to the ground and the mus 
tang sprang lightly forward. Roldan had 



 

singled out a well-built black, a little 
heavier than his mates and consequently 
somewhat in their rear. The mustang, 
who had slept off his fatigue, had no need 
of spur; he seemed to enter into the spirit 
of the chase possibly realised that if the 
chase failed he might have a double load 
to carry. He dashed over the rough adobe 
plain, Roldan holding the bridle high in 
his left hand, the coiled lasso in his right. 
Adan waddled after, far in the rear. 
The other horses had fled to the four 
winds, but the pursued, occasionally duck 
ing his head and kicking up his hind legs 
as if in contempt of the pretensions of 
mere man, made straight for the hills. 
Being undisciplined, however, he got over 
the ground clumsily, stumbled once or 
twice in the wide cracks of the adobe soil, 
and finally stopped short for want of wind. 
He swung about and glared defiantly at 
his pursuers out of injected eyes. He had 
never seen a lasso before, possibly not a 
man ; but his instinct told him that the 
horse and rider behind him were not
roving the plain in his own aimless fashion. 



 

He stood pawing the ground and shaking 
his great red nostrils. Suddenly to his 
surprise the part of the horse new to him 
lifted itself, and a black coiling something, 
graceful and swift as a rattlesnake, sprang 
through the air with a sharp audible rush. 
A quarter of a moment later he neighed 
with rage and terror: his neck was in a 
vice. 

He gave a leap that nearly dragged 
Roldan from his saddle ; but that expert 
young gentleman had secured the lariat to 
the high pommel of his saddle in a trice, 
and Don Jose Perez's mustang had there 
after to bear the brunt of the strain. 

The wild animal pulled and tugged and 
tore up the ground ; but finding that he 
but increased his own discomfort, he
gradually subsided, and when Roldan finally 
turned about and rode slowly toward Adan 
he followed meekly enough. 

When Adan saw the procession start in 
his direction he sat down on a stone to 
rest, and when it reached him he obeyed 
orders and sprang on the mustang's back 
as Roldan slipped off.


" That was well done, my friend," he 
said approvingly. " I could see it all ; but 
I thought my eyes would fly out of my 
head." 

Roldan walked cautiously up to his prize 
and attempted to pat it gently on the head. 
But it was some moments before he was 
able to touch the beast, who was sulky, 
cross, and frightened. When he did he 
swiftly loosened the lariat, and this 
procured him a meed of favour. The horse 
then allowed himself to be patted all down 
the side and back, nor once raised his 
hoof. 

Suddenly Roldan sprang to his back, 
gripping the mane with his hands, the 
flanks with his knees. But this was one 
liberty too much. The horse stood on his 
hind legs, made as if to go over backward, 
then suddenly stiffened all four legs and 
sprang up and down as automatically as if 
worked by a spring. Roldan was now in 
his element. He had broken in more than 
one bucking horse. He remained as im 
movable as a fly on the top of a coach, only 
giving an occasional prick with his spur to 

madden the animal and wear him out the 
sooner. 

Roldan had cast the lariat from the 
animal's neck as soon as he mounted, and 
it was well that he had, for his quarry 
made a sudden dash and did not stop for 
half a mile, when he paused on his fore 
feet, waving his hind in the air. 

But still Roldan kept his seat, Adan 
shouting : " Bravo ! Bravo ! " by way of 
encouragement. 

The battle lasted nearly an hour ; then 
the mustang confessed himself conquered, 
and the boys sought out the trail, from 
which they had wandered far, and contin 
ued their journey. 

" Caramba ! " exclaimed Roldan, " but I 
am famished, not to say tired. If it had 
been ten miles instead of twenty, it would 
not have been worth while." 



VI 



THEY rode on rapidly, too hungry to 
talk. The ground began to rise, 
and they advanced through hills sprout 
ing with the early green of winter. Once 
they paused, and tethering the horses 
where they could feed, shot several quail 
and roasted them. But the pangs of 
hunger were by no means allayed, and 
when, in the early afternoon, they saw 
the white walls of the Mission below them, 
they gave a shout of joy. 

The Mission stood in the middle of a 
valley, well away from woods and hills, 
and surrounded by a large vineyard and 
orchard. On the long corridor traversing 
the building adjoining the church, several 
figures in habit and cowl walked slowly 
behind the arches. Indians were in the 
vineyards and orchards and moving about 
the rancheria adjacent to the main build 
ings. Cattle were browsing on the hills. 



 

A stream tangled in willows cut a zig-zag 
course across the valley. 

The boys rode quickly down the hill 
side. As the padres heard the approach 
ing hoof-beats they paused in their walk, 
and shading their eyes with their hands 
gazed earnestly at the travellers.
