pressing an exclamation. 

"No one has written to me — for a long time," 
Sabina said, after a moment. 

She had been on the point of saying that she had 
never received a line from any member of her family 
since the crash, but that seemed to sound like a confi- 
dence, and what she really said was quite true. 





" Has not the Senator told you anything either ? " 
Malipieri asked. 

" No. I suppose he does not like to speak about our 
misfortunes before me." 

"Have you, I mean you yourself, any interest in 
the Palazzo Conti now? Can you tell me that?" 

" I know nothing — nothing ! " Sabina repeated the 
word with a slight tremor, for just then she ielt her 
position more keenly than ever before. " Why do you 
ask?" 

She could not help putting the question which rose 
to her lips the second time, but there was no coldness 
in her voice. She was very lonely, and she felt that 
Malipieri was speaking from some honourable motive. 

" I am living in the palace," Malipieri answered. 

Sabina looked up quickly, with an expression of 
interest in her pale young face. The thought that 
the man beside her was living in her old home was 
like a bond of acquaintance. 

"Really?" she cried. "In which part of the 
house?" 

"Do not seem interested, please," said Malipieri, 
suddenly looking very bored again. "If you do, we 
shall not be allowed to talk. I am living in the little 
apartment on the intermediate story. They tell me 
that a chaplain once lived there." 

" I know where it is," answered Sabina, " but I was 
never in the rooms. They used to be shut up, I 
think." 

The deputy who was haranguing on the subject of 



 

divorce seemed to be approaching his peroration. His 
great voice filled the large room with incessant noise, 
and everybody seemed anxiously waiting for a chance 
to contradict him. Malipieri was in no danger of 
being overheard. 

" If it happens," he said, " that I wish to communi- 
cate with you on a matter of importance, how can I 
reach you best ? " 

He asked the question quite naturally, as if he had 
known Sabina all his life. At first she was so much 
surprised that she could hardly speak. 

"I — I do not know," she stammered. 

She had never received letters from any one but her 
own family or her school friends, and a very faint 
colour rose in her pale cheek. Malipieri looked more 
bored and weary than ever. 

" It may be absolutely necessary for me to write to 
you before long," he said. " Shall I write by post? " 

Sabina hesitated. 

" Is there no one in all Rome whom you can trust 
to bring a note and give it to you when you are 
alone?" 

"There is Signor Sassi," Sabina answered almost 
instinctively. " But really, why should you — " 

" How can I find Sassi? " asked Malipieri, interrupt- 
ing the question. " Who is he ? " 

"He was our agent. Is he gone? The old porter 
will know where to find him. I think he lived near 
the palace. But perhaps the porter has been sent 
away too." 





"He is still there. Have you been made to sign 
any papers since you have been here ? " 

"No." 

" Will you promise me something ? " 

Sabina could not understand how it was that a man 
who had been a stranger two hours earlier was speaking to her almost as if he were an intimate friend, stillless why she no longer felt that she ought to check 
him and assert her dignity. 

"If it is right, I will promise it," she answered 
quietly, and looking down. 

" It is right," he said. " If the Senator, or any one 
else asks you to sign a paper, will you promise to con- 
sult me before doing so?" 

" But I hardly know you ! " she laughed, a little 
shyly. 

" It is of no use to waste time and trouble on social 
conventions," said Malipieri. "If you do not trust 
me, can you trust this Sassi?" 

" Oh yes ! " 

"Then consult him. I will make him consult me, 
and it will be the same — and ten times more conven- 
tional and proper." 

He smiled. 

" Will you promise that? " he asked. 

" Yes. I promise. But I wish you would tell me 
more." 

" I wish I could. But I hardly know you ! " He 
smiled again, as he repeated her own words. 

" Never mind that ! Tell me ! " 



 

" No. I cannot. If there is trouble I will tell you 
everything — through Sassi, of course." 

Sabina laughed, and all at once she felt as if she had 
known him for years. 

.At that moment the deputy finished his speech, and 
all who had anything to say in answer said it at once, 
in order to lose no time, while the speaker relighted 
his villainous black cigar, puffing tremendously. 

The Baroness suddenly remembered Sabina and 
Malipieri in the corner, and after screaming out several 
incoherent phrases, which might have been taken for 
applause or dissent and were almost lost in the general 
din, she moved across the room. 

" It is atrocious ! " she cried, as she reached Sabina. 
" I hope you have not heard a word he said ! " 

" When a man has such a voice as that, it is impos- 
sible not to hear him," said Malipieri, rising and 
answering before Sabina had time to speak. 

Sabina rose, too, rather reluctantly. 

" And of course you agreed with everything 
he said," the Baroness replied. " All anarchists 
do!" 

"I beg your pardon. I do not agree with him at 
all, and I am really not an anarchist." 

He smiled politely, and Sabina noticed with an un- 
accountable little thrill of satisfaction that the smile 
was quite different from the one she had seen in his 
face more than once while they had been talking to- 
gether. As for the deputy's discourse, she had not 
heard a word of it. ' 





The Baroness sat down on the sofa, and Sabina 
slipped away. She was not supposed to be in society 
yet, as she was not quite eighteen, and there was cer- 
tainly no reason why she should stay in the drawing- 
room that evening, while there were many reasons why 
she should go away. The Baroness breathed an audible 
sigh of relief when she was gone, for it was never pos- 
sible to predict what some excited politician might say 
before her in the heat of argument. 

In the silence of her own room she sat down to 
think over the unexpected events of the evening. 
Very young girls love to look forward to the mo- 
ment when they shall be able to " think " of what 
has happened, after they have met men they are in- 
clined to like, and who interest them. But when 
the time really comes they hardly ever think at all. 
They see pictures, they hear voices, they feel again 
what they have felt, they laugh, they shed tears all 
alone, and they believe they are thinking, or even 
reasoning. Their little joys come back to them, the 
little triumphs of their vanity, and also all the little 
hurts their sensitiveness has suffered, and which men 
do not often guess and still more rarely under- 
stand. 

There must be some original reason why all boys 
call girls silly, and all girls think boys stupid. It 
must be part of the first manifestation of that enor- 
mous difference which exists between the point of 
view of men and women in after life. 

Women are, in a sense, the embodiment of practice. 



 

while men are the representatives of theory. In 
practice, in a race for life, the runner who jumps 
everything in his way is always right, unless he 
breaks his neck. In theory, he is as likely to break 
his neck at the first jump as at the second, and the 
chances of his coming to grief increase quickly, 
always in theory, as he grows tired. So theory says 
that it is safer never to jump at all, but to go round 
through the gates, or wade ignominiously through 
the water. Women jump ; men go round. The dif- 
ference is everything. Women believe in what often 
succeeds in practice, and they take all risks and 
sometimes come down with a crash. Men theorize 
about danger, make elaborate calculations to avoid it 
and occasionally stick in the mud. When women 
fall at a stone wall they scream, when men are stuck 
in a bog they swear. The difference is fundamental. 
In nine cases out of ten it is the woman who enjoys 
the ecstatic delight of saying "I told you so," and 
there are plenty of women who would ask no greater 
joy in paradise than to say so to their husbands for 
ever and ever. Indeed, eternal reward and punish- 
ment could thus be at once combined and distributed 
in a simple manner. 

Sabina took her first fence that evening, for when 
she put out her candle she was sure that Malipieri 
was already her friend, and that she could trust him 
in any emergency. Moreover, though she would not 
have acknowledged it, she inwardly hoped that some 
emergency might not be far in the future. 





But Malipieri walked all the way from the Via 
Ludovisi to the Palazzo Conti, which is more than a 
mile, without noticing that he had forgotten to light 
the cigar he had taken out on leaving Volterra's 
house. 



CHAPTER VI 

Malzpieki had the Palazzo Conti to himself. The 
main entrance was always shut now, and only a small 
postern, cut in one side, of the great door, was left 
ajar. The porter loafed about in the great court 
with his broom and his pipe; in the morning his 
wife went upstairs and opened a few windows, merely 
as a formality, and late in the afternoon she shut 
them again. Malipieri's man generally went out 
twice every day, carrying a military dinner-pail, 
made in three sections, which he brought back half 
an hour later. Malipieri sometimes was not seen for 
several days, but frequently he went out in the 
morning and did not come back till dark. Now and 
then, things were delivered for him at the door, — a 
tin of oil for his lamps, a large box of candles, pack- 
ages of odd shapes, sometimes very heavy, and which 
the porter was told to handle with care. 

The old man tried to make acquaintance Tvith 
Malipieri's man, but foun'd it less easy than he had 
expected. In the first place, Masin came from some 
outlandish part of Italy where an abominable dialect 
was spoken, and though he could speak school Italian 
when he pleased, he chose to talk to the porter in 
his native jargon, when he talked at all. He might 







just as well have spoken Greek. Secondly, he re- 
fused the porter's repeated offers of a litre at the 
wine shop, always saying something which sounded 
like a reference to his delicate health. As he was 
evidently as strong as an ox, and as healthy as a 
savage or a street dog, the excuse carried no convic- 
tion. He was a hig, quiet fellow, with china-blue 
eyes and a reddish moustache. The porter was not 
used to such people, nor to servants who wore mous- 
taches, and was inclined to distrust the man. On 
the other hand, though Masin would not drink, he 
often gave the porter a cigar, with a friendly smile. 
One day, in the morning. Baron Volterra came to 
see Malipieri, and stayed over an hour, a part of 
which time the two men spent in the courtyard, 
walking up and down in the north-west corner, and 
then taking some measurements with a long tape 
which Malipieri produced from his pocket. When 
the Baron went away he stopped and spoke with the 
porter. First he gave him five francs ; then he in- 
formed him that his wages would be raised in future 
by that amount; and finally he told him that Signor 
Malipieri was an architect and would superintend the 
repairs necessary to the foundations at the north-west 
corner, that while the woA; was going on even the 
little postern door was to be kept shut all day, and 
no one was to be admitted on any condition without 
Signor Malipieri's express permission. The fat Baron 
fixed his eyes on the porter's with an oddly hard 
look, and said that he himself might come at any 



 

moment to see how the work was going on, and that 
if he found anybody inside the gate without Signor 
Malipieri's authority, it would be bad for the porter. 
During this conversation, Malipieri stood listening, 
and when it ended he nodded, as if he were satisfied, 
and after shaking hands with the Baron he went up 
the grand staircase without a word. 

It was all very mysterious, and the porter shook his 
head as he turned into his lodge after fastening the 
postern ; but he said nothing to his wife about what 
had passed. 

From what he had been told, he now naturally ex- 
pected that a number of masons would come in a day 
or two in order to begin the work of strengthening the 
foundations ; but no one came, and everything went 
on as usual, except that the postern was kept shut. 
He supposed that Malipieri was not ready, but he 
wisely abstained from asking questions. Then Mali- 
pieri asked him for the address of Pompeo Sassi, . 
and wrote it down in his pocket-book, and went out. 
That was on the morning after he had dined at the 
Baron's house, for it was not his habit to waste time 
when he wanted information. 

Sassi received Malipieri in a little sitting-room fur- 
nished with a heterogeneous collection of utterly use- 
less objects, all of which the old agent treasured with 
jealous affection, and daily recommended to the care of 
the elderly woman who was his only servant. The 
sofa and chairs had been new forty years ago, and 
though the hideous red-and-green stuffs with which 





they were covered were still tolerably vivid in colour, 
the legs did not look safe, and Malipieri kept his feet 
well under him and sat down cautiously. Two rickety 
but well-dusted tables were loaded with ancient nick- 
nacks, dating from the early part of the second French 
Empire, with impossibly ugly little figures carved out of 
cheap alabaster, small decayed photograph albums, and 
ingeniously bad wax flowers under glass shades. On 
the walls hung bad lithographs of Pius Ninth, Napo- 
leon Third and Metternich, with a large faded photo- 
graph of old Prince Conti as a young man. Malipieri 
looked at it curiously, for he guessed that it represented 
Sabina's father. The face was clean-shaven, thin and 
sad, with deep eyes and fair hair that looked almost 
white now, as if the photograph had grown old with the 
man, while he had lived. 

Sassi sat down opposite his visitor. He wore a black 
cloth cap with a green tassel, and rubbed his hands 
slowly while he waited for Malipieri to speak. The 
latter hesitated a moment and then went to the point 
at once. 

" You were the agent of the Conti estate for many 
years," he said. "I know the Senator Volterra and 
have met Donna Sabina. I understand that her mother 
has left her under the charge of the Senator's wife, and 
seems to have forgotten her existence. The young 
lady is apparently without resources of her own, and it 
is not clear what would become of her if the Volterra 
couple should not find it convenient to keep her with 
them. Is that the state of affairs ? " 



 

Sassi nodded gravely. Then he looked keenly at the 
young man, and asked him a question. 

" May I enquire why you take an interest in Donna 
Sabina Conti ? " 

Malipieri returned the other's gaze quietly. 

" I am an architect, called in by the Senator to super- 
intend some work on the palace. The Senator, as you 
know, took over the building when he foreclosed the 
mortgage, and he has not yet sold it, though he has 
refused several good offers. I have an idea that he 
believes it to be very valuable property. If this should 
turn out to be true, and if he should have made a very 
profitable transaction, he ought in honour, if not in law, 
to smake over a part of the profits to Donna Sabina, 
who has practically been cheated of her share in her 
father's estate. Her mother, and her brother and 
sister, spent everything they could lay hands on, 
whereas she never had anything. Is that true ? " 

" Quite true, quite true," repeated Sassi sadly. 

" And if Donna Sabina were to call them to account, 
I fancy the law would take a rather unpleasant view of 
what they did. I have heard that sort of thing called 
stealing when the persons who did it were not princes 
and princesses, but plain people like you and me. Do 
you happen to think of any better word ? " 

Sassi was silent. He had eaten the bread of the 
Conti all his life. He glanced at the faded photograph 
of the Prince, as if to explain, and Malipieri under- 
stood. 

" You are an honourable man," he said. " I can no 





more tell you why I wish to help Donna Sabina to her 
rights, if she has any, than I can explain a great many 
things I have done in my life. When I see a dog 
kicked, I always kick the man, if I can, and I do not 
remember to have regretted any momentary unpleas- 
antness that has followed in such cases. I have only 
seen Donna Sabina once, but I mean to help her if 
possible. Now tell me this. Has she any legal claim 
in the value of the palace or not ? " 

"I am afraid not," Sassi answered. 

"Do you know whether she was ever induced to 
sign any release of her guardians ? " 

"She never did." 

" That might be bad for them. That is all I wished 
to know. Thank you." 

Malipieri rose to take his leave. 

"If anything of importance happens, can you com- 
municate with Donna Sabina ? " he asked. 

" I can write to her," Sassi answered. " I suppose 
she would receive me if I went to the house. " 

" That would be better." 

" Excuse me," said the old man, before opening the 
door to let his visitor out, " am I right in supposing 
that the work the Baron wishes done is connected with 
the foundations ? " 

"Yes."
