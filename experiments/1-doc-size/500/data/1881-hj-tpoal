an honest man and a gentleman. Had not he assured her that 
he had no superstitions, no dull limitations, no prejudices that 
had lost their freshness? Hadn't he all the appearance of a 
man living in the open air of the world, indifferent to small 
considerations, caring only for truth and knowledge, and believ- 
ing that two intelligent people ought to look for them together, 
and whether they found them or not, to find at least some 
happiness in the search ? He had told her that he loved the 
conventional ; but there was a sense in which this seemed a 
noble declaration. In that sense, the love of harmony, and 
order, and decency, and all the stately offices of life, she went 
with him freely, and his warning had contained nothing ominous. 
But when, as the months elapsed, she followed him further and 
hj ed her into the mansion of his own habitation, then, then 
she had seen where she really was. She could live it over again, 
the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of 
her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever 
since ; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It 
was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of 
suffocation. Osmond's beautiful mind gave it neither light nor 
air; Osmond's beautiful mind, indeed, seemed to peep down 
from a small high window and mock at her. Of course it was 



 

not physical suffering ; for physical suffering there might have 
been a remedy. She could come and go ; she had her Jiberty ; 
her husband was perfectly polite. He took himself so seriously ; 
it was something appalling. Under all his culture, his clever- 
ness, his amenity, under his good-nature, his facility, his know- 
ledge of life, his egotism lay hidden like a serpent in a bank of 
flowers. She had taken him seriously, but she had not taken 
him so seriously as that. How could she especially when she 
knew him better ? She was to think of him as .he thought of 
himself as the first gentleman in Europe. So it was that she 
had thought of him at first, and that indeed was the reason she 
had married him. But when she began to see what it implied, 
she drew back ; there was more in the bond than she had meant 
to put her name to. It implied a sovereign contempt for every 
one but some three or four very exalted people whom he envied, 
and for everything in the world but half-a-dozen ideas of his 
own. That was very well ; she would have gone with him even 
there, a long distance ; for he pointed out to her so much of the 
baseness and shabbiness of life, opened her eyes so wide to the 
stupidity, the depravity, the ignorance of mankind, that she 
had been properly impressed with the infinite vulgarity of 
things, and of the virtue of keeping one's self unspotted by it. 
But this base, ignoble world, it appeared, was after all what one 
was to live for ; one was to keep it for ever in one's eye, in order, 
not to enlighten, or convert, or redeem it, but to extract from it 
some recognition of one's own superiority. On the one hand it 
was despicable, but on the other it afforded a standard. Osmond 
had talked to Isabel about his renunciation, his indifference, the 
ease with which he dispensed with the usual aids to success ; 
and all this had seemed to her admirable. She had thought it 
a noble indifference, an exquisite independence. But indifference 
was really the last of his Dualities ; she had never seen any one 
who thought so much of others. For herself, the world had 
always interested her, and the study of her fellow-creatures was 
her constant passion. She would have been willing, however, 
to renounce all her curiosities and sympathies for the sake of a 
personal life, if the person concerned had only been able to 
make her believe it was a gain ! This, at least, was her present 
conviction ; and the thing certainly would have been easier thsfla 
to care for society as Osmond cared for it. 

He was unable to live without it, and she saw that he had 
never really done so ; he had looked at it out of his window 
even when he appeared to be most detached from it. He had 
his ideal, just as she had tried to have hers ; only it was strange 



 

that people should seek for justice in such different quarters. 
His ideal was a conception of high prosperity and propriety, of 
the aristocratic life, which she now saw that Osmond deemed 
himself always, in essence at least, to have led. He had never 
lapsed from it for an hour ; he would never have recovered from 
the shame of doing so. That again was very well; here too she 
would have agreed ; hut they attached such different ideas, such 
different associations and desires, to the same formulas. Her 
notion of the aristocratic life was simply the union of great know- 
ledge with great liberty ; the knowledge would give one a sense 
of duty, and the liberty a sense of enjoyment. But for Osmond it 
was altogether a thing of forms, a conscious, calculated attitude. 
He was fond of the old, the consecrated, and transmitted ; so 
was she, but she pretended to do what she chose with it. He 
had an immense esteem for tradition; he had told her once that 
the best thing in the world was to have it, but that if one was 
so unfortunate as not to have it, one must immediately proceed 
to make it. She knew that he meant by this that she hadn't it, 
but that he was better off; though where he had got his tradi- 
tions she never learned. He had a very large collection of them, 
however ; that was very certain ; after a little she began to see. 
The great thing was to act in accordance with them ; the great 
thing not only for him but for her. Isabel had an undefined 
conviction that, to serve for another person than their proprietor, 
traditions must be of a thoroughly superior kind ; but she never- 
theless assented to this intimation that she too must march to 
the stately music that floated down from unknown periods in 
her husband's past ; she who of old had been so free of step, 
so desultory, so devious, so much the reverse of processional. 
There were certain things they must do, a certain posture they 
must take, certain people they must know and not know. When 
Isabel saw this rigid system closing about her, draped though it 
was in pictured tapestries, that sense of darkness and suffocation 
of which I have spoken took possession of her ; she seemed to 
be shut up with an odour of mould and decay. She had resisted, 
of course ; at first very humorously, ironically, tenderly ; then as 
the situation grew more serious, eagerly, passionately, pleadingly. 
She had pleaded the cause of freedom, of doing as they chose, of 
not caring for the aspect and denomination of their life the 
cause of other instincts and longings, of quite another i'Jeal. 
Then it was that her husband's personality, touched as it never 
had been, stepped forth and- stood erect. The things that she 
had said were answered only by his scorn, and she could see that 
he was ineffably ashamed of her. What did he think of her 



 

that she was base, vulgar, ignoble ? He at least knew now that 
she had no traditions ! It had not been in his prevision of 
things that she should reveal such flatness ; her sentiments were 
worthy of a radical newspaper or of a Unitarian preacher. The 
real offence, as she ultimately perceived, was her having a mind 
of her own at all. Her mind was to be his attached to his own 
like a small garden-plot to a deer-park. He would rake the soil 
gently and water the flowers ; he would weed the beds and 
gather an occasional nosegay. It would be a pretty piece of 
property for a proprietor already far-reaching. He didn't wish 
her to be stupid. On the contrary, it was because she was clever 
that she had pleased him. But he expected her intelligence to 
operate altogether in his favour, and so far from desiring her 
mind to be a blank, he had nattered himself that it would be 
richly receptive. He had expected his wife to feel with him 
and for him, to enter into his opinions, his ambitions, his pre- 
ferences ; and Isabel was obliged to confess that this was no 
very unwarrantable demand on the part of a husband. But there 
were certain things she could never take in. To begin with, 
they were hideously unclean. She was not a daughter of the 
Puritans, but for all that she believed in such a thing as purity. 
It would appear that Osmond didn't ; some of his traditions 
made her push back her skirts. Did all women have lovers ? 
Did they all lie, and even the best have their price ? Were 
there only three or four that didn't deceive their husbands'? 
When Isabel heard such things she felt a greater scorn for them 
than for the gossip of a village-parlour a scorn that kept its 
freshness in a very tainted air. There was the taint of her sis- 
ter-in-law; did her husband judge only by the Countess Gemini  
This lady very often lied, and she had practised deceptions 
which were not simply verbal. It was enough to find these facts 
assumed among Osmond's traditions, without giving them such 
"a general extension. It was her scorn of his assumptions it 
was that that made him draw himself up. He had plenty of 
contempt, and it was proper that his wife should be as well 
furnished ; but that she should turn the hot light of her dis- 
dain upon his own conception of things this was a danger he 
had not allowed for. .He Delieved he should have regulated 
her emotions before she came to that ; and Isabel could easily 
imagine how his ears scorched when he discovered that he had 
been too confident. When one had a wife who gave one that 
sensation there was nothing left but to hate her ! 

She was morally certain now that this feeling of hatred, which 
at first had been a refuge and a refreshment, had become the 



 

occupation and comfort of Osmond's life. The feeling  as deep, 
because it was sincere ; he had had a revelation that, after all, 
she could dispense with him. If to herself the idea was start- 
ling, if it presented itself at first as a kind of infidelity, a capa- 
city for pollution, what infinite effect might it not be expected 
to have had upon him ? It was very simple ; he despised her ; 
she had no traditions, and the moral horizon of a Unitarian 
minister. Poor Isabel, who had never been able to understand 
Unitarianism ! This was the conviction that she had been living 
with now for a time that she had ceased to measure. What was 
coming what was before them   That was her constant ques- 
tion. What would he do what ought she to do ? When a 
man hated his wife, what did it lead to 1 She didn't hate him, 
that she was sure of, for every little while she felt a passionate 
wish to give him a pleasant surprise. Very often, however, she 
felt afraid, and it used to come over her, as I have intimated, 
that she had deceived him at the very first. They were strangely 
married, at all events, and it was an awful life. Until that 
morning he had scarcely spoken to her for a week ; his manner 
was as dry as a burned-out fire. She knew there was a special 
reason ; he was displeased at Ralph Touchett's staying on in 
Borne. He thought she saw too much of her cousin he had 
told her a week before that it was indecent she should go to him 
at his hotel. He would have said more than this if Ralph's 
invalid state had not appeared to make it brutal to denounce 
him; but having to contain himself only deepened Osmond's 
disgust. Isabel read all this as she would have read the hour on 
the clock-face ; she was as perfectly aware that the sight of her 
interest in her cousin stirred her husband's rage, as if Osmond 
had locked her into her bedroom which she was sure he wanted 
to do. It was her honest belief that on the whole she was not 
defiant ; but she certainly could not pretend to be indifferent to 
Ralph. She believed he was dying, at last, and that she should 
never see him again, and this gave her a tenderness for him that 
she had never known before. Nothing was a pleasure to her 
now ; how could anything be a pleasure to a woman who knew 
that she had thrown away her life ? There was an everlasting 
weight upon her heart there was a livid light upon everything. 
But Ralph's little visit was a lamp in the darkness ; for the hour 
that she sat with him her spirit rose. She felt to-day as if he 
had been her brother. She had never had a brother, but if she 
had, and she were in trouble, and he were dying, he would be 
dear to her as Ralph was. Ah yes, if Gilbert was jealous of her 
there was perhaps some reason; it didn't make Gilbert look 




better to sit for half-an-hour with Ralph.' It was not that they 
talked of him it was not that she complained. His name was 
never uttered between them. It was simply that Ealph was 
generous and that her husband was not. There was something 
in Ealph's talk, in his smile, in the mere fact of his being in 
Rome, "that made the blasted circle round which she walked more 
spacious. He made her feel the good of the world ; he made 
her feel what might have been. He was, after all, as intelligent 
as Osmond quite apart from his being better,  .nd. thus it 
seemed to her an act of devotion to conceal her misery from him. 
She concealed it elaborately ; in their talk she was perpetually 
hanging out curtains and arranging screens. It lived before her 
again -it had never had time to die that morning in the gar- 
den at Florence, when he warned her against Osmond. She had 
only to close her eyes to see the place, to hear his voice, to feel 
the warm, sweet air. How could he have known? What a 
mystery ! what a wonder of wisdom ! As intelligent as Gilbert !
He was much more intelligent, to arrive at such a judgment as 
that. Gilbert had never been so deep, so just She had told 
him then that from her at least he should never know if he 
was right ; and this was what she was taking care of now. It 
gave her plenty to do ; there was passion, exaltation, religion in 
it. Women find their religion sometimes in strange exercises, 
and Isabel, at present, in playing a part before her cousin, had 
an idea that she was doing him a kindness. It would have been 
a kindness, perhaps, if he had been for a single instant a dupe. 
As it was, the. kindness consisted mainly in trying to make him 
believe that he had once wounded her greatly and that the event 
had put him to shame, but that as she was very generous and he 
was so ill, she bore him no grudge and even considerately forbore 
to flaunt her happiness in his face. Ralph smiled to himself, as 
he lay on his sofa, at this extraordinary form of consideration ; 
but he forgave her for having forgiven him. She didn't wish 
him to have the pain of knowing she was unhappy ; that was 
the great thing, and it didn't matter that such knowledge would 
rather have righted him. 

For herself, she lingered in the soundless drawing-room long 
after the fire had gone out. There was no danger of her feeling 
the cold ; she was in a fever. She heard the small hours strike, 
and then the great ones, but her vigil took no heed of time. Her 
mind, assailed by visions, was in a state of extraordinary activity, 
and her visions might as well come to her there, where she sat 
up to meet them, as on her pillow, to make a mockery of rest. 
As I have said, she believed she was not defiant, and what could 



 

be a better proof of it than that she should linger there half the 
night, trying to persuade herself that there was no reason why 
Pansy shoufdn't be married as you would put a letter in the post- 
office ? When the clock struck four she got up ; she was going 
to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the 
candles had burned down to their sockets. But even then she 
stopped again in the middle of the room, and stood there gazing 
at a remembered vision that of her husband and Madame 
Merle, grouped unconsciously and familiarly. 



XLIII. 

THREE nights after this she took Pansy to a great party, to 

which Osmond, who -never went to dances, did not accompany 

them. Pansy was as ready for a dance as ever ; she was not of 

a generalising turn, and she had not extended to other pleasures 

the interdict that she had seen placed on those of love. If she 

was biding her time or hoping to circumvent her father, she must 

have had a prevision of success. Isabel thought that this was 

not likely ; it was much more likely that Pansy had simply 

determined to be a good girl. She had never had such a chance, 

and she had a proper esteem for chances. She carried herself 

no less attentively than usual, and kept no less anxious an eye 

upon her vaporous skirts; she held her bouquet very tight, 

and counted over the flowers for the twentieth time. She made 

Isabel feel old ; it seemed so long since she had been in a nutter 

about a ball. Pansy, who was greatly admired, was never in 

want of partners, and very soon after their arrival she gave 

Isabel, who was not dancing, her bouquet to hold. Isabel had 

rendered this service for some minutes when she became aware 

that Edward Rosier was standing before her. He had lost his 

affable smile, and wore a look of almost military resolution; 

the change in his appearance would have made Isabel smile if 

she had not felt that at bottom his case was a hard one ; he had 

always smelt so much more of heliotrope than of gunpowder. 

He looked at her a moment somewhat fiercely, as if to notify 

her that he was dangerous, and then he dropped his eyes on her 

bouquet. After he had inspected it his glance softened, and he 

said quickly. 

" It's all pansies ; it must be hers ! " 

Isabel smiled kindly. 

" Yes, it's hers ; she gave it to me to hold." 



 

" May I hold it a little, Mrs. Osmond ? " the poor young man 



" No, I can't trust you ; I am afraid you wouldn't give it 
back." 

" I am not sure that I should ; I should leave the house with 
it instantly. But may I not at least have a single flower ? " 

Isabel hesitated a moment, and then, smiling still, held out 
the bouquet. 

" Choose one yourself. It's frightful what I am doing for 
you." 

" Ah, if you do no more than this, Mrs. Osmond ! " Rosier 
exclaimed, with his glass in one eye, carefully choosing his 
flower. 

" Don't put it into your button-hole," she said. " Don't for 
the world ! " 

" I should like her to see it. She has refused to dance with 
me, but I wish to show her that I believe in her still." 

" It's very well to show it to her, but it's out of place to show 
it to others. Her father has told her not to dance with you." 

"And is that all you can do for me? I expected more from 
you, Mrs. Osmond," said the young man, in a tone of fine 
general reference. " You know that our acquaintance goes back 
very far quite into the days of our innocent childhood." 

" Don't make me out too old," Isabel answered, smiling. 
"You come back to that very often, and I have never denied it. 
But I must tell you that, old friends as we are, if you had done 
me the honour to ask me to marry you I should have refused 
you." 

"Ah, you don't esteem me, then. Say at once that you think 
I'm a trifler ! " 

u I esteem you very much, but I'm not in love with you. 
What I mean by that, of course, is that I am not in love with 
you for Pansy." 
."Very good; I see; you pity me, that's all." 

And Edward Rosier looked all round, inconsequently, with 
his single glass. It was a revelation to him that people shouldn't 
be more pleased ; but he was at least too proud to show that the 
movement struck him as general. 

Isabel for a moment said nothing. His manner and appear- 
ance had not the dignity of the deepest tragedy ; his little glass, 
among other things, was against that. But she suddenly felt 
touched; her own unhappiness, after all, had something in 
common with his, and it came over her, more than before, that 
here, in recognisable, if not in romantic form, was the~ most 



 

affecting thing in the world young love struggling with 
adversity. 

' ' Would you really be very kind to her I " she said, in a low 
tone. 

He dropped his eyes, devoutly, and raised the little flower 
which he held in his fingers to his lips. Then he looked at her. 
" You pity me ; but don't you: pity her a little ? " 

" I don't know ; I am not sure. She will always enjoy life." 

" It will depend on what you call life ! " Rosier exclaimed. 
" She won't enjoy being tortured." 

" There will be nothing of that." 

" I am glad to hear it. She knows what she is about. You 
will see." 

"I think she does, and she will never disobey her father. 
But she is coming back to me," Isabel added, "and I must beg 
you to go away." 

Rosier lingered a moment, till Pansy came in sight, on the arm 
of her cavalier; he stood just long enough to look her in the 
face. Then he walked away, holding up his head ; and the 
manner in which he achieved this sacrifice to expediency con- 
vinced Isabel that he was very much in love. 

Pansy, who seldom got disarranged in dancing, and looked 
perfectly fresh and cool after this exercise, waited a moment and 
then took back her bouquet. Isabel watched her and saw that 
she was counting the flowers ; whereupon she said to herself 
that, decidedly, there were deeper forces at play than she had 
recognised. Pansy had seen Rosier turn away, but she said 
nothing to Isabel about him ; she talked only of her partner, 
after he had made his bow and retired ; of the music, the floor, 
the rare misfortune of having already torn her dress. Isabel 
was sure, however, that she perceived that her lover had ab- 
stracted a flower ; though this knowledge was not needed to 
account for the dutiful grace with which she responded to the 
appeal of her next partner. That perfect amenity under acute 
constraint was part of a larger system. She was again led forth 
by a flushed young man, this time carrying her bouquet ; and 
she had not been absent many minutes when Isabel saw Lord 
Warburton advancing through the crowd. He presently drew 
near and bade her good evening ; she had not seen him since 
the day before. He looked about him, and then " Where is 
the little maid?" he asked. It was in this manner that he 
formed the harmless habit of alluding to Miss Osmond. 

" She is dancing," said Isabel ; " you will see her some- 
where." 



384  

He looked among the dancers, and at last caught Pansy's 
eye. " She sees me, but she won't notice me," he then remarked. 
" Are you not dancing ? " 

" As you see, I'm a wall-flower." 

" Won't you dance with me ? " 

" Thank you ; I would rather you should dance with my 
little maid." 

" One needn't prevent the other ; especially as she is engaged." 

" She is not engaged for everything, and you can reserve your- 
self. She dances very hard, and you will be the fresher." 

" She dances beautifully," said Lord Warburton, following her 
with his eyes. "Ah, at last," he added, "she has given me a 
smile." He stood there with his handsome, ea.sy, important 
physiognomy ; and as Isabel observed him it came over her, as 
it had done before, that it was strange a man of his importance 
should take an interest in a little maid. It struck her as a great 
incongruity ; neither Pansy's small fascinations, nor his own 
kindness, his good-nature, not even his need for amusement, 
which was extreme and constant, were sufficient to account for
