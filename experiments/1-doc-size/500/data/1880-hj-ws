XXXIY. 

IT was her habit to remain in town very late in 
the summer; she preferred the house in Washing- 
ton Square to any other habitation whatever, and it 
was under protest that she used to go to the sea-side 
for the month of August. At the sea she spent her 
month at an hotel. The year that her father died 
she intermitted this custom altogether, not thinking 
it consistent with deep mourning ; and the year af- 
ter that she put off her departure till so late that the 
middle of August found her still in the heated soli- 





tude of Washington Square. Mrs. Penniman, who 
was fond of a change, was usually eager for a visit 
to the country ; but this year she appeared quite 
content with such rural impressions as she could 
gather at the parlor- window from the ailantus-trees 
behind the wooden paling. The peculiar fragrance 
of this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the even- 
ing air, and Mrs. Penniman, on the warm nights of 
July, often sat at the open window and inhaled it. 
This was a happy moment for Mrs. Penniman ; af- 
ter the death of her brother she felt more free to 
obey her impulses. A vague oppression had disap- 
peared from her life, and she enjoyed a sense of 
freedom of which she had not been conscious since 
the memorable time, so long ago, when the Doctor 
went abroad with Catherine and left her at home to 
entertain Morris Townsend. The year that had 
elapsed since her brother's death reminded her of 
that happy time, because, although Catherine, in 
growing older, had become a person to be reckoned 
with, yet her society was a very different thing, as 
Mrs. Penniman said, from that of a tank of cold wa- 
ter. The elder lady hardly knew what use to make 
of this larger margin of her life ; she sat and looked 
at it very much as she had often sat, with her poised 
needle in her hand, before her tapestry-frame. She 
had a confident hope, however, that her rich im- 
pulses, her talent for embroidery, would still find 
their application, and this confidence was justified 
before many months had elapsed. 

Catherine continued to live in her father's house, 
in spite of its being represented to her that a maid- 
en lady of quiet habits might find a more conven- 





lent abode in one of the smaller dwellings, with 
brown stone fronts, which had at this time begun to 
adorn the transverse thoroughfares in the upper part 
of the town. She liked the earlier structure it had 
begun by this time to be called an " old " house 
and proposed to herself to end her days in it. If it 
was too large for a pair of unpretending gentlewom- 
en, this was better than the opposite fault; for Cathe- 
rine had no desire to find herself in closer quarters 
with her aunt. She expected to spend the rest of 
her life in Washington Square, and to enjoy Mrs. 
Penniman's society for the whole of this period ; as 
she had a conviction that, long as she might live, 
her aunt would live at least as long, and always re- 
tain her brilliancy and activity. Mrs. Penniman 
suggested to her the idea of a rich vitality. 

On one of those warm evenings in July of which 
mention has been made, the two ladies sat together 
at an open window, looking out on the quiet Square. 
It was too hot for lighted lamps, for reading, or for 
work ; it might have appeared too hot even for con- 
versation, Mrs. Penniman having long been speech- 
less. She sat forward in the window, half on the 
balcony, humming a little song. Catherine was with- 
in the room, in a low rocking-chair, dressed in white, 
and slowly using a large palmetto fan. It was in 
this way, at this season, that the aunt and niece, after 
they had had tea, habitually spent their evenings. 

" Catherine," said Mrs. Penniman at last, " I am 
going to say something that will surprise you." 

"Pray do," Catherine answered ; "I like surprises. 
And it is so quiet now." 

" Well, then, I have seen Morris Townsend." 





If Catherine was surprised, she checked the ex- 
pression of it ; she gave neither a start nor an ex- 
clamation. She remained, indeed, for some mo- 
ments intensely still, and this may very well have 
been a symptom of emotion. " I hope he was well," 
she said at last. 

" I don't know ; he is a great deal changed. He 
would like very much to see you." 

"I would rather not see him," said Catherine, 
quickly. 

" I was afraid you would say that. But you don't 
seem surprised !" 

" I am very much." 

" I met him at Marian's," said Mrs. Penniman. 
" He goes to Marian's, and they are so afraid you 
will meet him there. It's my belief that that's why 
he goes. He wants so much to see you." Cathe- 
rine made no response to this, and Mrs. Penniman 
went on. "I didn't know him at first, he is so re- 
markably changed; but he knew me in a minute. 
He says I am not in the least changed. You know 
how polite he always was. He was coming away 
when I came, and we walked a little distance to- 
gether. He is still very handsome, only of course 
he looks older, and he is not so so animated 
as he used to be. There was a touch of sadness 
about him ; but there was a touch of sadness about 
him before, especially when he went away. I am 
afraid he has not been very successful that he has 
never got thoroughly established. I don't suppose 
he is sufficiently plodding, and that, after all, is what 
succeeds in this world." Mrs. Penniman had not 
mentioned Morris Townsend's name to her niece for 





upwards of the fifth of a century ; but now that she 
had broken the spell, she seemed to wish to make 
up for lost time, as if there had been a sort of ex- 
hilaration in hearing herself talk of him. She pro- 
ceeded, however, with considerable caution, pausing 
occasionally to let Catherine give some sign. Cathe- 
rine gave no other sign than to stop the rocking of 
her chair and the swaying of her fan ; she sat mo- 
tionless and silent. " It was on Tuesday last," said 
Mrs. Penniman, " and I have been hesitating ever 
since about telling you. I didn't know how you 
might like it. At last I thought that it was so long 
ago that yon would probably not have any particu- 
lar feeling. I saw him again after meeting him at 
Marian's. I met him in the street, and he went a 
few steps with me. The first thing he said was 
about you ; he asked ever so many questions. Ma- 
rian didn't want me to speak to you ; she didn't 
want you to know that they receive him. I told 
him I was sure that after all these years you couldn't 
have any feeling about that ; you couldn't grudge 
him the hospitality of his own cousin's house. I 
said you would be bitter indeed if you did that. 
Marian has the most extraordinary ideas about what 
happened between you; she seems to think he be- 
haved in some very unusual manner. I took the 
liberty of reminding her of the real facts, and plac- 
ing the story in its true light. He has no bitterness, 
Catherine, I can assure you ; and he might be ex- 
cused for it, for things have not gone well with him. 
He has been all over the world, and tried to estab- 
lish himself everywhere ; but his evil star was against 
him. It is most interesting to hear him talk of his 





evil star. Everything failed ; everything but his 
you know, you remember his proud, high spirit. 
I believe he married some lady somewhere in Europe. 
You know they marry in such a peculiar matter-of- 
course way in Europe; a marriage of reason they 
call it. She died soon afterward ; as he said to me, 
she only flitted across his life. He has not been in 
New York for ten years ; he came back a few days 
ago. The first thing he did was to ask me about 
you. He had heard you had never married ; he 
seemed very much interested about that. He said 
you had been the real romance of his life." 

Catherine had suffered her companion to proceed 
from point to point, and pause to pause, without in- 
terrupting her; she fixed her eyes on the ground 
and listened. But the last phrase I have quoted was 
followed by a pause of peculiar significance, and then, 
at last, Catherine spoke. It will be observed that 
before doing so she had received a good deal of in- 
formation about Morris Townsend. " Please say no 
more ; please don't follow up that subject." 

" Doesn't it interest you ?" asked Mrs. Penniman, 
with a certain timorous archness. 

" It pains me," said Catherine. 

" I was afraid you would say that. But don't you 
think you could get used to it ? He wants so much 
to see you." 

" Please don't, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, get- 
ting up from her seat. She moved quickly away, 
and went to the other window, which stood open to 
the balcony ; and here, in the embrasure, concealed 
from her aunt by the white curtains, she remained 
a long time, looking out into the warm darkness. 





She had had a great shock ; it was as if the gulf of 
the past had suddenly opened, and a spectral figure 
had risen out of it. There were some things she 
believed she had got over, some feelings that she 
had thought of as dead; but apparently there was 
a certain vitality in them still. Mrs. Penniman had 
made them stir themselves. It was but a momen- 
tary agitation, Catherine said to herself; it would 
presently pass away. She was trembling, and her 
heart was beating so that she could feel it ; but this 
also would subside. Then suddenly, while she wait- 
ed for a return of her calmness, she burst into tears. 
But her tears flowed very silently, so that Mrs. Pen- 
nirnan had no observation of them. It was perhaps, 
however, because Mrs. Penniman suspected them 
that she said no more that evening about Morris 
Townsend. 



XXXV. 

HER refreshed attention to this gentleman had 
not those limits of which Catherine desired, for her- 
self, to be conscious ; it lasted long enough to enable 
her to wait another week before speaking of him 
again. It was under the same circumstances that 
she once more attacked the subject. She had been 
sitting with her niece in the evening; only on this 
occasion, as the night was not so warm, the lamp 
had been lighted, and Catherine had placed herself 
near it with a morsel of fancy-work. Mrs. Penni- 
man went and sat alone for half an hour on the bal- 
cony ; then she came in, moving vaguely about the 





room. At last she sunk into a seat near Catherine, 
with clasped hands, and a little look of excitement. 

" Shall you be angry if I speak to you again about 
him ?" she asked. 

Catherine looked up at her quietly. " Who is he ?" 

"He whom you once loved." 

" I shall not be angry, but I shall not like it." 

"He sent you a message," said Mrs. Penniman. 
" I promised him to deliver it, and I must keep my 
promise." 

In all these years Catherine had had time to for- 
get how little she had to thank her aunt for in the 
season of her misery ; she had long ago forgiven 
Mrs. Penniman for taking too much upon herself. 
But for a moment this attitude of interposition and 
disinterestedness, this carrying of messages and re- 
deeming of promises, brought back the sense that 
her companion was a dangerous woman. She had 
said she would not be angry ; but for an instant she 
felt sore. "I don't care what you do with your 
promise !" she answered. 

Mrs. Penniman, however, with her high concep- 
tion of the sanctity of pledges, carried her point. 
" I have gone too far to retreat," she said, though 
precisely what this meant she was not at pains to 
explain. " Mr. Townsend wishes most particularly 
to see you, Catherine ; he believes that if you knew 
how much, and why, he wishes it, you would con- 
sent to do so." 

" There can be no reason," said Catherine ; " no 
good reason." 

" His happiness depends upon it. Is not that a 
good reason ?" asked Mrs. Penniman, impressively. 







" Not for me. My happiness does not." 

" I think you will be happier after you have seen 
him. He is going away again going to resume 
his wanderings. It is a very lonely, restless, joyless 
life. Before he goes he wishes to speak to you ; it 
is a fixed idea with him he is always thinking of 
it. He has something very important to say to you. 
He believes that you never understood him that 
you never judged him rightly, and the belief has al- 
ways weighed upon him terribly. He wishes to jus- 
tify himself; he believes that in a very few words 
he could do so. He wishes to meet you as a 
friend." 

Catherine listened to this wonderful speech with- 
out pausing in her work ; she had now had several 
days to accustom herself to think of Morris Town- 
send again as an actuality. When it was over she 
said simply, " Please say to Mr. Townsend that I wish 
he would leave me alone." 

She had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at 
the door vibrated through the summer night. Cath- 
erine looked up at the clock; it marked a quarter 
past nine a very late hour for visitors, especially in 
the empty condition of the town. Mrs. Penniman 
at the same moment gave a little start, and then 
Catherine's eyes turned quickly to her aunt. They 
met Mrs. Penniman's, and sounded them for a mo- 
ment sharply. Mrs. Penniman was blushing; her 
look was a conscious one ; it seemed to confess some- 
thing. Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose 
quickly from her chair. 

" Aunt Penniman," she said, in a tone that scared 
her companion, " have you taken the liberty . . . ?" 





" My dearest Catherine," stammered Mrs. Penni- 
man, "just wait till you see him !" 

Catherine had frightened her aunt, but she was 
also frightened herself ; she was on the point of rush- 
ing to give orders to the servant, who was passing 
to the door, to admit no one ; but the fear of meet- 
ing her visitor checked her. 

" Mr. Morris Townsend." 

This was what she heard, vaguely but recogniza- 
bly, articulated by the domestic, while she hesitated. 
She had her back turned to the door of the par- 
lor, and for some moments she kept it turned, feel- 
ing that he had come in. He had not spoken, how- 
ever, and at last she faced about. Then she saw a 
gentleman standing in the middle of the room, from 
which her aunt had discreetly retired. 

She would never have known him. He was for- 
ty-five years old, and his figure was not that of the 
straight, slim young man she remembered. But it 
was a very fine presence, and a fair and lustrous 
beard, spreading itself upon a well-presented chest, 
contributed to its effect. After a moment Cathe- 
rine recognized the upper half of the face, which, 
though her visitor's clustering locks had grown thin, 
was still remarkably handsome. He stood in a deeply 
deferential attitude, with his eyes on her face. " I 
have ventured I have ventured ;" he said, and then 
he paused, looking about him, as if he expected her 
to ask him to sit down. It was the old voice; but 
it had not the old charm. Catherine, for a minute, 
was conscious of a distinct determination not to in- 
vite him to take a seat. Why had he come? It 
was wrong for him to come. Morris was embar- 


 

rassed, but Catherine gave him no help. It was 
not that she was glad of his embarrassment ; on the 
contrary, it excited all her own liabilities of this 
kind, and gave her great pain. But how could she 
welcome him when she felt so vividly that he ought 
not to have come ? "I wanted so much I was de- 
termined," Morris went on. But he stopped again ; 
it was not easy. Catherine still said nothing, and 
he may well have recalled with apprehension her 
ancient faculty of silence. She continued to look 
at him, however, and as she did so she made the 
strangest observation. It seemed to be he, and yet 
not he; it was the man who had been everything, 
and yet this person was nothing. How long ago it 
was how old she had grown how much she had 
lived ! She had lived on something that was con- 
nected with Mm, and she had consumed it in doing 
so. This person did not look unhappy. He was 
fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed, mature 
and complete. As Catherine looked at him, the 
story of his life defined itself in his eyes ; he had 
made himself comfortable, and he had never been 
caught. But even while her perception opened it- 
self to this, she had no desire to catch him ; his pres- 
ence was painful to her, and she only wished he 
would go. 

" Will you not sit down ?" he asked. 

" I think we had better not," said Catherine. 

" I offend you by coming ?" He was very grave ; 
he spoke in a tone of the richest respect. 

" I don't think you ought to have come." 

"Did not Mrs. Penniman tell you did she not 
give you my message ?" 





" She told me something, but I did not under- 
stand." 

" I wish you would let me tell you let me speak 
for myself." 

" I don't think it is necessary," said Catherine. 

" Not for you, perhaps, but for me. It would be 
a great satisfaction and I have not many." He 
seemed to be corning nearer ; Catherine turned away. 
" Can we not be friends again ?" he asked. 

" We are not enemies," said Catherine. " I have 
none but friendly feelings to you." 

"Ah, I wonder whether you know the happiness 
it gives me to hear you say that !" Catherine utter- 
ed no intimation that she measured the influence of 
her words ; and he presently went on, " You have 
not changed the years have passed happily for you." 

" They have passed very quietly," said Catherine. 

" They have left no marks ; you are admirably 
young." This time he succeeded in coming nearer 
he was close to her ; she saw his glossy perfumed 
beard, and his eyes above it looking strange and 
hard. It was very different from his old from his 
young face. If she had first seen him this way 
she would not have liked him. It seemed to her 
that he was smiling, or trying to smile. " Cathe- 
rine," he said, lowering his voice, "I have never 
ceased to think of you." 

" Please don't say these things," she answered. 

"Do you hate me?" 

" Oh no," said Catherine. 

Something in her tone discouraged him, but in 
a moment he recovered himself. " Have you still 
some kindness for me, then 3" 





" I don't know why you have come here to ask 
me such things !" Catherine exclaimed. 

" Because for many years it has been the desire 
of my life that we should be friends again." 

" That is impossible." 

" Why so ? Not if you will allow it." 

" I will not allow it," said Catherine. 

He looked at her again in silence. " I see ; my
