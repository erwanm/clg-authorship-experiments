on every one, and it was not broken until the strange 
figure turned slowly and passed out with noise 
less feet. 

"Was that a ghost?" asked one as the door 
closed behind her. 

" Who is she ?" queried another. 

But no one could tell. The veil was drawn so 
closely that not a feature was visible. 

"Somebody 's wife," said old Jacobs, who was 
nearly always on hand. 

" Does anybody here own her ?" inquired Lloyd, 
trying to make light of the visitation and give the 
incident a humorous turn. 

" I wouldn 't care to be in his shoes," returned one 
of the company. " That woman knows tragedy." 

"And is playing it now," said Jacobs, "and will 
go on playing it after the curtain falls and the lights 
are out." 

Our guests were less noisy after that. There were 
some present who were evidently made uncomfort- 



 

able by the incident some who could not help 
thinking of a lonely wife at home. Two men, one 
a handsome, rather stylish-looking person whose 
name I did not know, but who dropped in occasion 
ally, went out quietly soon after. 

" I shouldn 't wonder if they knew her," was re 
marked. 

" If they do," spoke out Lloyd, " I hope they 'll 
put a strait-jacket on her. No woman of deli 
cacy or with any respect for her husband would go 
spying around of nights in taverns and saloons. Sup 
pose she 'd found him here. Would it have helped 
matters any to disgrace him in our eyes ? These 
women are the very devil." 

No one answered him. The fine hilarity of the 
evening did not return. Our guests were human, 
and could not shake off the influence of that weird- 
looking visitant. 

A month afterward she came in, veiled, noiseless 
and ghost-like. I looked at her closely as she stood 
a little way inside of the door, with her eyes, that 
shone through her veil, searching about the room. 
I saw her bosom rise and fall like one trying to re 
press strong feelings. 

Again the silence of death was on the company. 
She stood a little while, as on her first visit, then 
turned with what seemed a weary and disappointed 
air, and vanished through the door. 

"There 's a little too much of this!" exclaimed 
old Jacobs, in a mock serious tone. "And, anyhow, 
 



 

it isn 't in the play. Look here, Hiram" addressing 
me " you 've got to suppress that woman. She 
mustn t be coming on the stage every night after 
this fashion, or else you must put her in the bill. 
Then we 'll know what 's coming, and get our nerves 
ready." 

A laugh greeted this sally, but it wasn 't very 
hearty. 

" I 'll tell you what I think about it," said another. 

" Well, what 's your guess ?" inquired Jacobs. 

" She 's after some fellow." 

"No doubt, and that fine fellow 's her husband," 
was replied. 

" Don 't believe it. Didn 't you notice one hand in 
her pocket ?" 

" No, no," went round the room. 

" Well, I did noticed it both times." 

"And what does it signify if she had?" 

"It 's my guess that there was a pistol in her 
pocket" 

" By George ! I believe you 've hit the nail on the 
head !" exclaimed two or three in a breath. " I 've 
seen women looking round after their husbands," 
added one of them, " but never a critter of her kind. 
She 's one on em as knows how that a man isn 't 
going to be reformed by such doings. There 's 
a gay deceiver running round who 'd better say his 
prayers in double quick when she gets her eyes on 
him." 

" All afloat, gentlemen all afloat," sang out Ja- 



 

cobs, in a high key. " I know what she 's after ; it 's 
just come to me. She 's going to shoot a saloon 
keeper. So look out, Masters Lloyd and Jones." 

This was greeted with a laugh from the company, 
and an oath from Lloyd. 

" Oh, you needn 't swear about it," retorted the old 
pressman; "it can t help the matter any. But it 's 
plain to see that she 's got wound up for a strike, and 
it 's my guess, if she finds somebody she knows here, 
there 'll be a dead rum-seller to put under ground. 
She 'll be a dead shot. Them kind always are. So 
take my advice, Tom Lloyd, and make your will." 

Lloyd became very angry at this, and swore 
fiercely at the old pressman. 

" If you can t keep a civil tongue in your head, 
you 'd better stay away," he added, cooling down a 
little. " I won t put up with these insults in my 
own house." 

"Insults!" retorted Jacobs; "I 'd like to know 
where the insult lies ? What did I say to insult you, 
ha, old chap ? Insult ! Bah ! you re growing mighty 
thin-skinned. But getting mad won t save you when 
she comes round, if somebody happens to be here. 
So, as I just said, get your will ready." 

" Women grow very desperate sometimes, and do 
desperate things," remarked a person who had been 
silent until now. He spoke quietly, but soberly. 
" They are made up of passions and impulses are 
soft as summer breezes when all goes pleasantly 
with them, but fierce and reckless as the wildest 



 

storm if crossed and thwarted. It 's a dangerous ex 
periment to drive a woman to the wall, to rob her of 
what is dearest in life, to rouse in her the sleeping 
lion." 

The man spoke in a deep, musical voice, and in a 
style of language not often heard in our saloon. He 
was a stranger among us, and had rather a seedy 
look. Every one turned to him. He went on : 

" Home is a woman 's world, and its inmates her 
most precious things. Her life is bound up in her 
husband and children. If a maiden, and she have a 
lover, it is bound up in him. Touch any of these, 
and you touch her life. Hurt them, and you hurt 
her. Some women are weak, and some saintly, and 
some are strong-willed and desperate ; when annoyed 
and threatened, a tiger. The weak fall, the saintly 
find strength in religion, but the strong-willed get a 
new vitality when the evil days come. You saw one 
of these latter just now. One that she loves is, I 
take it, drifting away from her on the river of ine 
briation, else why seek him here ? If she lose him, 
she loses all she has in life. It is a fearful thing for 
her. She will save him if she can, and if any one 
stand in her way, he must go down. 

" I don 't  think," he continued, his tone softening, 
but every word coming clear and emphatic, "that 
you gentlemen" and he looked at Lloyd and myself 
" count the cost of your work really comprehend 
what flows from it ; if you did, you would be little 
better than devils incarnate." 



 

The hot blood rushed to Tom Lloyd 's face, and I 
felt like throwing a tumbler. But there was a fas 
cination about the speaker 's voice and manner that 
completely won our company, and I saw with angry 
annoyance that his hard thrust at us was enjoyed. 

" But I know," he went on, " that you have shut 
your eyes to all this. It is none of your business, 
you say. Men will drink, and you only give them 
what they want. I'm sorry sorry for you, sorry for 
myself and sorry for every man here who feels as I 
do the almost irrepressible cravings of an appetite 
grown too strong for him. And if there be any 
among you not over on the wrong side, be warned 
in time. Let this thing alone. Keep away from 
places where drink is sold." 

"Bravo!" cried old Jacobs; "them 's my senti 
ments. Pve been preaching em here from the be 
ginning. I 've told the boys over and over again 
that it wasn 't the thing to be coming here night after 
night. Just look at me, I 've said, and take warn 
ing. But it doesn 't seem to be of any use. They 
come and come, and drink and tipple, and will all go 
to the devil, I'm afraid, in spite of everything I can 
say." 

All this, Lloyd and I were compelled to hear and 
yet keep silence, for the general feeling was for the 
time against us. 

" It is a bad business, take it as you will," said the 
stranger, in a depressed voice ; and rising, he com 
menced buttoning his coat. He moved toward the 


 

door, but hesitated after a few steps, and then came 
round to the bar and called for a glass of brandy. 

" I preach and practice both, you see," was his 
remark as he poured out the brandy. " You mustn t 
be offended. I have to talk sometimes, but I guess 
all I say will not do you much hurt not half so 
much," he added as he set down his glass, his voice 
changing and his eyes flashing a little, " as you will 
do yourselves in this wretched business. Curses, 
like chickens, always come home to roost. Keep 
that in mind, gentlemen. Good-night;" and he went 
away. 



CHAPTER XL 

THE work of a year was very apparent even to 
my eye, that cared not to see. Of the thirty 
or forty men and boys in the bindery and printing 
office who patronized "The Retreat" our fellow 
workmen against whom we had conspired nearly 
every one was worse off in something. Two or 
three once steady journeymen, who hardly ever lost 
a day, had become idle bar-room loungers for a third 
of their time. Among all I noticed a steady in 
crease from month to month of the daily number 
of drinks and a lowering of the standard of health. 
Rheumatism troubled a great many. Dyspepsia was 
a common complaint. I don 't  think any were free 
from some ailment. One was bilious, another had a 
torpid liver and another 's head was out of order, 
and the worse they felt, the more liquor they gen 
erally drank. It was a common thing to hear the 
question, " How are you to-day ?" answered by, 
" Only so-so. Stiff with rheumatism ;" or, " Miser 
able ;" or, " Head terribly out of sorts no appetite 
can t sleep ;" or, " Nothing to brag of running 
down somehow don 't  know what 's the matter." 
As I recall in mind the men who drank with us 

 



 

regularly, I am not able to remember one who was 
in vigorous health. All were ailing in something. 

Mr. Ashley, the foreman of the bindery, took the 
matter seriously to heart, and gave positive orders 
that no liquor should be brought into the establish 
ment, on penalty of an instant dismissal of the of 
fender. A great deal was smuggled in, however. 
Lloyd 's son had been caught in the act, as before 
mentioned, and summarily sent away. The foreman 
saw the evil work going on, the hurt and hindrance 
occasioned by the daily tippling and diminished pro 
duct of his men, and set himself at last to the busi 
ness of " rooting us out," to use his own words. We 
heard of it, for he uttered his threat openly. 

" Let him try it on," was our derisive response to 
those who repeated his threat. 

" He 's bound to catch you if it can be done, for 
Ashley isn 't a man that does things by halves," they 
said. 

" How will he catch us ?" we asked. " We 've got 
a license." 

" There 's a law against selling to minors, and he 's 
going to trip you there. So look out." 

" Oh, is he ? Give him our compliments and tell 
him to go ahead." 

There were from eight to ten persons in the estab 
lishment under legal age who often came in for beer. 
If it could be clearly proved in court that we had 
sold intoxicating liquors to one of these, there was 
danger of a fine and sixty days imprisonment. The 



 

trouble would lie in getting the evidence, and even 
then the jury might not agree. 

Forewarned, we felt safe enough. It was easy to 
make a show of not selling to the boys, yet have an 
understanding with them that if they went up stairs, 
where no one could see them receive the liquor or 
drink it, they could have all they wanted. 

Ashley dropped in upon us half a dozen times, 
now in the day and now in the evening. Once or 
twice he found minors whom he knew in the bar 
room, but that wasn 't enough; he must see them 
drink. He tried to get some of the sober men in 
his employment to help him by visiting our place 
and spying around, but none of them cared to en 
gage in that sort of business. He then tried the 
constables of the ward, giving them the names of 
every minor in the establishment and urging them 
to do their duty, but the constables laughed in their 
sleeves and gave us warning of our danger. 

It all came to nothing. Ashley, after worrying 
himself for two or three weeks to no purpose, gave 
it up. He found out, by that time, that the law reg 
ulating the sale of liquors had been very carefully 
framed, and that, while it appeared to be very strin 
gent and against us, had essential defects that made 
it little more than a dead letter. 

I believe he was successful in getting the proof of 
sale to two minors, and consulted a lawyer about 
having us arrested and tried, but the lawyer told him 
that the chances were all against a conviction ; that 



 

the liquor-sellers would combine the moment one of 
their number was brought up and spend any amount 
of money to defeat the ends of justice; that there 
were shrewd and unscrupulous lawyers, known to 
these men, who understood all the ins and outs 
of court practice, and who could make a case of this 
kind go almost any way they pleased. 

" You 'd better let it alone," said the lawyer, in 
conclusion, " unless you have a good deal of money 
to spend and a good deal of time on your hands. It 
will certainly take both of these to make success 
anything like probable, for all these are on the other 
side." 

I learned this much from one of the men, who 
heard it from Ashley, and who also heard him say 
that our saloon had, in a single year, lessened the 
average product of the establishment at least ten per 
cent. The aggregate of that was a very heavy dis 
count on the productive labor of this one establish 
ment, and could not have been less than from eight 
to ten thousand dollars. 

The loss of wages by the men in consequence of 
diminished health, idleness and demoralization could 
not have been less than two-thirds of this sum. Add 
what they spent for the liquor that worked all 
this loss and demoralization, and it is easy to see 
what lessening of personal and home comfort among 
them must follow what deprivation, suffering, want, 
discouragement and sorrow in their families. 

No wonder that Ashley desired to " root us out." 



 

But he was not able. There were cunningly devised 
laws on our side, and we felt that we were safe. 

I have mentioned that among the apprentices in 
the bindery were two sons of widowed mothers and 
one lad, the son of a poor clergyman, named Allen. 

I remember when Ned Allen came first to the 
bindery. He was a fresh, bright, innocent boy. I 
do not believe he had ever been inside of a tavern 
until after we opened " The Retreat." Then it be 
came easy and natural for him to drift in among us. 
Our new place was the talk of the bindery, and our 
tempting lunches, varied from day to day, had an en 
ticement about them strong to young and keen ap 
petites. Ned came one forenoon, about a week after 
we opened, in company with a journeyman who had 
asked him to come and get a lunch. The boy 
looked shy and not quite at ease, but he ate a slice 
of cold ham and a piece of bread and drank a glass 
of beer with the relish a good appetite gives. The 
journeyman paid for both drinks. Then, after lin 
gering and talking for a little while, they went out. 

I did not see him again for several days. When 
he next came, it was by himself, and at lunch-time. 
He was little better at ease than on the first occa 
sion, and only drank a part of the beer I gave him 
with his lunch. He took a few pennies from his 
pocket, and selecting five, paid for the first glass of 
beer he ever bought. It might have been fancy, but 
I thought his hand trembled a little as he reached 
me the five small coins. His face looked very sober. 



 

It was clear that he felt conscious of doing some 
thing wrong. 

It was a week before the boy came again, and 
then it was in company with John Ashley, who 
treated him. 

" Ned and I are coming round to-night," said 
John as they were going out. 

" All right ! Glad to see you," Lloyd answered, 
cheerily. " Nice place up stairs to meet the boys 
and play dominoes or backgammon." 

Sure enough, after supper John and Ned came in. 
John treated, as in the morning. After lingering 
a while in the bar-room among the men they knew, 
and listening to their not very proper talk, the two 
lads went up stairs, and I did not see them again. 

" Isn 't that Rev. Mr. Allen 's son ?" inquired a man 
who had been looking pretty closely at Ned. 

Some one who knew answered that it was. 

He shook his head gravely, remarking, " I'm sorry 
to see him here." 

"Why?" asked Lloyd. "Is he any better than 
John Ashley?" 

" Perhaps not," the man replied, " but neither of 
them has any business here." 

A retort was on Lloyd 's tongue, but I touched 
him in warning, and he kept silent. 

" Let him have his say." I spoke in an undertone. 
" It doesn 't hurt anybody." 

Young Allen did not come very often at first, but 
after some months he became a regular visitor, and 



 

spent two or three evenings with us every week, en 
joying himself. He learned fast after the change 
began could swear glibly and talk "smutty" talk 
as easily as the next one. 

This change in the boy could not take place with 
out it being noticed at home, and I heard, incident 
ally, that his father and mother were getting very
