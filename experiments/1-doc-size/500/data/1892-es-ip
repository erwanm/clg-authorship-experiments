timics with burning spots, danced on 
their spears and helmets, dazzled the 
spectators' eyes, From above descended the caresses of flutes; the air 
was sweet with perfumes, alive with 
multicolored motes ; the terraces were 
parterres o£ blending hues, and into 
that splendor a hundred lions, their 
tasseled tails sweeping the sand, 
entered obliquely. 

The mob of the Bestiarii had gone. 
In the middle of the arena, a band of 
Ethiopians, armed with arrows, 
knives and spears, knelt, their oiled 
black breasts uncovered. 

Leisurely the lions turned their 
huge, intrepid heads; to their jowls 
wide creases came. There was a 
glitter of fangs, a shiver that moved 
the mane, a flight of arrows, mount- 
ing murmurs, the crouch of beasts 
-preparing to spring, a deafening roar, 
and, abruptly, a tumultuous mass, the 
suddenness of knives, the snap of 
bones, the cry of the agonized, the 
fury of beasts transfixed, the shrieks 



 







of the mangled, a combat hand to 
fang, from which lions fell back, their 
jaws torn asunder, while others retreated, a black body swaying be- 
tween their terrible teeth, and, insensibly, a descending quiet. 

At once there was an eruption 
of bellowing elephants, painted and 
trained for slaughter, that trampled 
on wounded and dead. At a call from a keeper the elephants disappeared. There was a rush of mules 
and slaves; the carcasses and corpses 
vanished, the toilet of the ring was 
made; and then came a plunge of 
bulls, mists of vapor about their long, 
straight horns, their anxious eyes 
dilated. Beyond was a troop of 
Thessalians. For a moment the bulls 
snorted, pawing the sand with their 
fore-feet, as though trying to remember what they were doing there. Yet 
instantly they seemed to know, and 



 



with lowered heads, they plunged on 
the point of spears. But no matter, 
horses went down by the hundred; 
and as the bulls tired of goring the 
dead, they fought each other; fought 
rancorously, fought until weariness 
overtook them, and the surviving 
Thessalians leaped on their backs, 
twisted their horns, and threw them 
down, a sword through their throb- 
bing throats. 

Successively the arena was occupied 
by bears, by panthers, by dogs trained 
for the chase, by hunters and hunted. 
But the episode of the morning was 
a dash of wild elephants, attacked on 
either side; a moment of sheer delight, 
in which the hunters were tossed up 
on the terraces, tossed back again by 
the spectators, and trampled to death. 

With that for bouquet the first part 
of the performance was at an end. 
By way of interlude, the ring was 




 



peopled with acrobats, who flew up 
in the air like birds, formed pyramids 
together, on the top of which little 
boys swung and smiled. There was 
a troop of trained lions, their manes 
gilded, that walked on tight-ropes, 
wrote obscenities in Greek, and danced 
to cymbals which one of them played. 
There were geese-fights, wonderful 
combats between dwarfs and women; 
a chariot race, in which bulls, painted 
white, held the reins, standing upright 
while drawn at full speed; a chase of 
ostriches, and feats of haute ecole on 
zebras from Madagascar. 

The interlude at an end, the sand 
was re-raked, and preceded by the 
pomp of lictors, interminable files of 
gladiators entered, holding their knives 
to Nero that he might see that they 
were sharp. It was then the eyes of 
the vestals lighted; artistic death was 
their chiefest joy, and in a moment, 




 

when the spectacle began and the first 
gladiator fell, above the din you could 
hear their cry "Htc hahet! " and 
watch their delicate thumbs reverse. 

There was no cowardice in that 
arena. If by chance any hesitation 
were discernible, instantly there were 
hot irons, the sear of which revivified courage at once. But that was 
rare. The gladiators fought for applause, for liberty, for death; fought 
manfully, skillfully, terribly, too, and 
received the point of the sword or the 
palm of the victor, their expression 
unchanged, the face unmoved. 
Among them, some provided with a 
net and prodigiously agile, pursued 
their adversaries hither and thither, 
trying to entangle them first and kill 
them later. Others, protected by 
oblong shields and armed with short, 
sharp swords, fought hand-to-hand. 
There were still others, mailed horse- 



 



men, who fought with the lance, 
and charioteers that dealt death from 
high Briton cars. 

As a spectacle it was unique; one 
that the Romans, or more exactly, 
their predecessors, the Etruscans, had 
devised to train their children for 
war and allay the fear of blood. It 
had been serviceable, indeed, and 
though the need of it had gone, still 
the institution endured, and in enduring constituted the chief delight of 
the vestals and of Rome. By means 
of it a bankrupt became consul and 
an emperor beloved. It had stayed 
revolutions, it was the tax of the proletariat on the rich. Silver and bread 
, were for the individual, but spectacles 
were for the crowd. 

During the pauses of the combats 
I the dead were removed by men 
BSnasked as Mercury, god of hell; red 
f irons, that others, masked as Charon, 







 



bore, being first applied as safeguard 
against swoon or fraud. And when, 
to the kisses of flutes, the last palm 
had been awarded, the last death 
acclaimed, a ballet was given; that of 
Paris and Venus, which Apuleius has 
described so well, and for afterpiece 
the romance of Pasiphx and the 
bull. Then, as night descended, so 
did torches, too; the arena was 
strewn with vermilion; tables were 
set, and to the incitement of crotals, 
Lydians danced before the multitude, 
toasting the last act of that wonderful 
day. 

It was with such -Tiagnificence that 
Nero showed the impresario's skill, 
the politician's adroitness. Where 
the artist, which he claimed to be, 
really appeared, was in the refurbishing of Rome. 

In spite of Augustus' boast, the ' 
city was not by any means of marble. 



 







It was filled with crooked little 
streets, with the atrocities of the 
Tarquins, with houses unsightly and 
perilous, with the moss and dust of 
ages; it compared with Alexandria 
as London compares with Paris; it 
had a splendor of its own, but a 
splendor that could be heightened. 

Whether the conflagration which 
occurred at that time was the result 
of accident or design is uncertain 
and in any event immaterial. 
Tacitus says that when it began Nero 
was at Antium, in which case he 
must have hastened to return, for ad- 
mitting that he did not originate the 
fire, it is a matter of agreement that 
he collaborated in it. In quarters 
where it showed symptoms of weakness it was by his orders coaxed to 
new strength; colossal stone buildings, on which it had little effect, 
were battered down with catapults. 




Fire is a perfect poet. No de- 
signer ever imagined the surprises it 
creates, and when, at the end of the 
week three-fourths of the city was in 
ruins, the beauty that reigned there 
must have been subhme. That it in- 
spired Nero is presumable. The 
palace on the Palatine, which 
Tiberius embellished and Caligula 
enlarged, had gone; in its place rose 
another, aflame with gold. Before it 
Neropolis extended, a city of triumphal arches, enchanted temples, 
royal dwellings, shimmering porticoes, glittering roofs, and wide, hos- 
pitable streets. It was fair to the 
eye, purely Greek; and on its heart, 
from the Circus Maximus to the 
Forum's edge, the new and gigantic 
palace shone. Before it was a lake, a 
part of which Vespasian drained and 
replaced with an amphitheatre that 
covered eight acres. About that 



 



lake were separate edifices that 
formed a city in themselves; between 
them and the palace, a statue of Nero 
in gold and silver mounted precipitately a hundred and twenty feet — a 
statue which it took twenty-four elephants to move. About it were 
green savannahs, forest reaches, the 
call of bird and deer, while in the distance, fronted by a stretch of columns 
a mile in length, the palace stood — a 
palace so ineffably charming that on 
the day of reckoning may it outbalance a few of his sins. Even the cellars were frescoed. The baths were 
quite comfortable; you had waters 
salt or sulphurous at will. The dining halls had ivory ceilings from 
which flowers fell, and wainscots that 
changed at each service. The walls 
were alive with the glisten of gems, 
with marbles rarer than jewels. In 
one hall was a dome of sapphire, a 



 



floor of malachite, crystal columns 
and red -gold walls. 

"At last," Nero murmured, "I am 
lodged like a man." 

No doubt. Yet in a mirror he 
would have seen a bloated beast in a 
flowered gown, the hair done up in a 
chignon, the skin covered with eruptions, the eyes circled and yellow; 
a woman who had hours when she 
imitated a virgin atbay, others when 
she was wife, still others when she 
expected to be a mother, and that 
woman, a senatorial patent of divinity 
aiding, was god — Apollo's peer, imperator, chief of the army, pontifix 
maximus, master of the world, with 
the incontestible right of life and death 
over every being in the dominions. 

It had taken the fresh-faced lad who 
blushed so readily. Just fourteen years  
to effect that change. Did he regret ' 
it? And what should Nero regret? 



 



Nothing, perhaps, save that at the 
moment when he declared himself to 
be lodged like a man, he had not 
killed himself like one. But of that 
he was incapable. Had he known 
what the future held, possibly he 
might have imitated that apotheosis 
of vulgarity in which Sardanapalus 
eclipsed himself, but never could he 
have died with the good breeding 
and philosophy of Cato, for neither 
good breeding nor philosophy was in 
him. Nero killed himself like a coward, yet that he did kill himself, in no 
matter what fashion, is one of the few 
things that can be said in his favor. 

Those days differed from ours. 
There were circumstances in which 
suicide was regarded as the simplest 
of duties. Nero did his duty, but not 
until he was forced to it, and even then 
not until he had been asked several 
times whether it was so hard to die. 



 



The empire had wearied of him. In 
Neropolis his popularity had gone as 
popularity ever does; the conflagration 
had killed it. 

Even as he wandered, lyre in 
hand, a train of Lesbians and ped- 
erasts at his heels, through those halls 
which had risen on the ruins, and which 
inexhaustible Greece had furnished 
with a fresh crop of white immortals 
the world rebelled. Afar on the outskirts of civilization a vassal, ashamed 
of his vassalage, declared war, not 
against Rome, but against an emperor 
that played the flute. In Spain, in 
Gaul, the legions were choosing other 
chiefs. The provinces, depleted by 
imperial exactions, outwearied by the 
increasing number of accusers, whose 
accusations impoverishing them 
served only to multiply the prodigalities of their Ctcsar, revolted. 

Suddenly Nero found himself alone. 



 



As the advancing rumor of rebellion 
reached him, he thought of flight; 
there was no one that would accompany him. He called to the preto- 
rians; they would not hear. Through 
the immensity of his palace he sought 
one friend. The doors would not 
open. He returned to his apartment; 
the guards had gone. Then terror 
siezed him. He was afraid to die, 
afraid to live, afraid of his solitude, 
afraid of Rome, afraid of himself; but 
what frightened him most was that 
everyone had lost their fear of him. 
It was time to go, and a slave aiding, 
he escaped in disguise from Rome, 
and killed himself, reluctantly, in a 
hovel. 

'ualis artifex pereof" he is 
reported to have muttered. Say 
rather, qualis iiicechtis. 



It was in those days that the nebulous figure of Apollonius of Tyana 
appeared and disappeared in Rome. 
His speech, a wayward comminghng 
of puerihty and charm, Philostratus has 
preserved. Rumor had preceded him. 
It was said that he knew everything, 
save the caresses of women; that he was 
famihar with all languages; with the 
speech of bird and beast; with that of 
silence, for silence is a language too; 
that he had prayed in the Temple of 
Jupiter Lycceus, where men lost their 
shadows, their lives as well; that he 
had undergone the eighty initiations 
of Mithra; that he had perplexed the 
magi; confuted the gj mnosophists; 
that he foretold the future, healed the 
sick, raised the dead; that beyond the 



 



Himalayas he had encountered every 
species of ferocious beast, except the 
tyrant, and that it was to see one he 
had come to Rome. 

Nero was singularly free from pre 
judice. Apart from a doll which he 
worshipped he had no superstitions. 
He had the plain man's dislike of philosophy; Seneca had sickened him of 
it, perhaps; but he was sensitive, not 
that he troubled liimself particularly 
about any lies that were told of him, 
but he did object to people who went 
about telling the truth. In that respect he was not unique; we are all 
like him, but he had ways of stilling 
the truth which were imperial and his 
own. 

Promptly on Apollonius he loosed 
his bull-dog Tigellin, prefect of police. 

TigcUin caught him. "What have 
you with you?" he asked. 

''Continence, Justice, Temperance, 







Strength and Patience," Apollonius 
answered. 

"Your slaves, I suppose. Make out 
a list of them." 

Apollonius shook his head. "They 
are not my slaves; they are my masters." 

"There is but one," Tigcliin retorted — "Nero. Why do you not 
fear him.'"' 

"Because the god that made him 
terrible made me without fear." 

"I will leave you your liberty," 
muttered the startled Tigelhn, "but 
you must give bail." 

"And who," asked Apollonius superbly, "would bail a man whom no 
one can enchain . " Therewith he 
turned and disappeared. 

At that time Nero was in training 
to suffocate a lion in the arena. A
