" We come together as usual and go through the 
forms. There's no getting on about anything, 
as I told you." 

"What would you call getting on, in the case 
of the Sunday school ? " 

"Why being alive, and learning something, and 
perhaps feeling something. There might be more 
in the school, too; but I wasn't thinking of that." 

" I should not call it getting on, unless the children were brought to Christ." 

" How do you mean ? " 

" Made Christians of." 

" I don't believe anybody thinks of such a thing." 

"I'll tell you what, Barbara; it would be a good 
tiling if we could have a Teachers meeting." 

"What for? "

" To study the lesson together. To study the 
Bible. I mean, a meeting every week." 

" We never had one in Chesterfield." 

"That's not a reason why we shouldn't." 

" Yes, it is. People don't like anything they are 
not accustomed to." 

"Well, Bab, suppose you and I come together 
and study the lesson ? Come and drink tea with 
me next Saturday night, and we'll try. Do ! " 

" I should like it of all things. At what o'clock 
shall I come ? " 

" When you like. Say at four ; then we can have 
a good time before tea." 

With which agreement we parted; and I went 



 

home, marvelling somewhat at the lines of activity 
opening before me already; but very thankful and 
very glad. 



March 22. 

I HAVE been to see Mercy Quick. She is going 
fast, but she is ready, and very patient. I find 
it is a great comfort both to her and her mother, to 
have me come and sit with them a while and read 
and talk. I must go just as often as I can; for 
they are much alone. Their house lies so high up 
the valley that it is out of the way of any but good 
walkers. It is a comfort to them too to have some 
nice little thing for Mercy to eat, that has not 
been prepared at home. I take something with 
me always. 

It comes quite conveniently, apropos to these 
long walks of mine, to leave somebody at home 
to sit with grandmother. It is quite understood 
now that Arethusa is not to think, for the present 
at leasfy of going home ; and she has blossomed out 
in consequence into a glow of happiness which it is 
touching to see. Grandmother has a kindness for 
her, and is very well satisfied to be left with her 
when I am out.^ So my way is all clear. Both of 
them however pricked up their ears when they saw 
mo beginning to make cake Saturday morning. 

" What's coming now, Desire ? " grandma inquired. "Are you going to have company?" 



 

I said yes. 

" Saturday evening ! " said Aretlmsa. 

"Precisely," I answered smiling.v "Saturday evening is the time to prepare for Sunday, isn't it? and 
we are just going to study the lesson, the Sunday 
school lesson, and get it ready for to-morrow." 

" Who ? " said grandma ; and I told her. 

"Seems to me, you don't want to make much 
cake, if Barbara Burgum is all your company." 

"I am not going to make much," I answered. 

"Where are you going to take her to study ? " 

"Into the parlour." 

"Then you'll want a fire there." 

"I am going to make a fire." 

"Seems to me, Barbara might do her studying 
at home." 

"It is good for the teachers to come together to 
study, grandmamma. Mr. Iredell thinks it is an 
essential of a thriving Sunday school." 

" But you and Bab ain't all the teachers." 

"We are two." 

"If you think to get them all here," Arethusa 
now put in, "you'll have a job on your hands; at 
least, if you make cake for the whole of them." 

"What's the cake to do with studying the Bible?" 
grandma asked. 

"Sweeten it, perhaps," said Arethusa. "Or to 
reward them for it." 

"I'd make mountains of cake," said I, "if it 
would get them to come. But it's only Barbara, 
grandmother." 



 

" If it's only Barbara, I should think you woulti 
take her into your room and make a fire in the 
stove there. I shouldn't think you'd warm the 
parlour up for her." 

But I knew my own thoughts; and though this 
time it was "only Barbara," I preferred to make 
certain arrangements. The parlour was nice and 
warm to receive us, when she came; and I had 
brought together what I had of helps for our study ; 
not much, yet more than she had at command. A 
map or two; a good Bible dictionary; and Cruden's 
Concordance. The room looked cosy and cheerful ; 
the table was covered with, a thick green cloth ; 
and I had an easy rocking chair on one side of it, 
in which I installed my guest. 

" Well, this is what I call comfortable ! " she ex 
claimed. "Is here where you do your study work?" 

"To-day; not always." 

" You'll have to tell me how to study. I haven't 
an idea. How to study the Bible, that is; I can 
get along with some other things; at least I used 
to, in my school times. But I don't see how you 
can study the Bible." 

" Do you understand it all ? " 

" La, no ! of course not. That's what I am here 
for." 

" Then study is taking the means to understand 
it, and using them." 

" I don't see how you can. Here's this chapter 
of Daniel, where the lesson is for to-morrow. I 
don't understand a word of it; all these goats and 



 

rams and horns. It's just a jumble; and how 
can I be expected to make others see into what is 
as dark as a pocket to me ? " 

" Let us try if we cannot get some light on it 
Do you know what a horn is ? " 

" Something growing out of an animal's head, 
that he fights with." 

"Well, you must not think of that here. Yon 
must think that it means a power. In Bible 
symbolism a horn stands for power and might ; 
I suppose because, as you say, the horns are an 
animal's strength, for attack or defence. Then 
beasts also are the figure for dominions for rul 
ing and governing might upon earth. The goat 
and the ram in this chapter stand for the two king 
doms, or empires, of Persia and Macedonia." 

; Which is which ? " 

"The agile swift goat, which came from the 
west and touched not the ground, is the Gre 
cian empire ; and Alexander is that notable horn 
between his eyes ; eyes being in Bible language 
the symbol for intelligence and insight, of which 
Alexander had plenty. The % ram is Persia." 

" How do you come to know so much ? " 

" I have heard it talked about a good deal, in 
Philadelphia-" 

"Then, if it means all that, why don't it say 
Greece and Persia and Alexander, and not a horn 
and a ram and a he-goat ? " 

" Kemember, Daniel was shewn these things in vision. How could he see power in the abstract" 



 

DY  dominion ? Things must take form to be 
seen; and they would make more impression so, 
too." 

" I don't know about that. Then here are four 
horns a little further on." 

"Four kings or .kingdoms, when Alexander's empire was broken up and divided between his four 
successors, don't you recollect? Lysimachus, Cas- 
sander, Seleucus and Ptolemy. Ptolemy in Egypt, 
and Seleucus in Syria." 

" I seem to remember something about all that. 
But who is this little horn, growing up out of 
one of the four ? It is fearfully confusing ! " 

"Not at all; just translate; put the thing for the 
symbol. Out of the line of the Syrian kings arose 
that mischief-maker, Antiochus Epiphanes." 

"I don't know him. I don't know anything 
about him." 

So then I opened my Bible dictionary, and read 
to her what that gave us under several of these 
heads. And I brought an old Bible which contained the Apocrypha, and read the first chapter 
of the Maccabees. Barbara grew visibly more and 
more interested with every word. At last she declared that she believed she understood it, and now 
would never forget it. 

"You see the use of these figures and sym 
bols," said I. "What interests me specially is 
the point, that Antiochus is the Old Testament 
type of Antichrist." 

" if you go into that" cried Barbara, " I shall 



 

declare off! I have heard of Antichrist all my 
life. Pa and Deacon Parsons are always at it, and 
sometimes Squire Binnacle too. I have heard of 
Antichrist all my life, and the scarlet woman." 

" Did you understand it ? " 

" Not a bit! nor they either, though they thought 
they did." 

"Now, Barbara, turn to the thirteenth of the 
Revelation " 

" do y&lt;5u read in the Revelation ? it is all con 
fusion and riddles to me. I don't see how anybody can read it." 

" Look at this one chapter to please me." 

"I suppose I can stand that, " said Barbara; 
and we read it. I asked if she had understood it ? 

" Not a particle." 

"Translate again, from the symbols into the 
things symbolized. You see, in the times coming, there will arise a power or empire in the 
world, ruling all the world, that will set itself 
against the truth and the people of God and the 
kingdom of Christ. Just as Antiochus against 
Judah and the Jews. It will have power; it will tempt and persecute, and make things hard for the 
Christians; hard to bear, hard to stand. So hard, 
that many will not stand, but give way. And you 
see, that everybody will carry in his face the sign 
which party he belongs to." 

Barbara studied the chapter again with a grave 
face. Then I made her go back to the twenty- 
fourth of Matthew, where these times are prophesied of; and to Second Thessalonians, where the 
hostile power is more in detail described. She be 
came exceedingly engaged in the study, comparing 
one place with another, turning from Matthew to 
Revelation and back to Thessalonians again. 

"Arid what will this terrible Wicked One be?" 
she asked. 

"Some developement of the world-power, of 
which the devil is at all times the secret instigator 
and strength." 

" You believe in the devil ? " said Barbara, looking up at me. 

"I believe whatever the Bible says; and it says 
a great deal of him." 

" I don't like to believe in such a being ! " she 
exclaimed with a sort of shudder. 

" It is dangerous not to believe in him." 

"Why?" 

"Then he has you at great advantage." 

"What does this mark mean, Desire? Will it 
be something that can be seen ? " 

" I think so. I am not sure but it can be seen 
now." 

"Why, that beast don't exist yet." 

" He will be only a new developement of the 
world-power, which has been fighting against God 
and his people all along. And I think even now 
the world sets its mark on those who belong to it." 

"What sort of a mark?" 

" Did you never see people whose faces said uii- 
mistakeably that they belonged to the world, and 



 

had nothing to do with anything else, nor any connection with anything else ? " 

Barbara nodded silently, with her eyes fixed upon 
me. Then she said, 

" That's the description of the most of the face* 
I know." 

"And there is a very different mark, which the 
Lord sets upon his own. I sometimes think I can 
see that too." 

" What is that ? " 

" Look at Rev. vii. 3, and in. 12, and xiv. 1." 

" His name in their foreheads ! " cried Barbara. 
" How do you make that out ? " 

" I do not suppose it is his name in letters, any 
more than the other mark is in letters. See now, 
Barbara, the words in the eighth of Romans, 29th 
verse." 

Barbara read them and repeated, " To be conformed to the likeness does that mean, to look 
like him ? I thought it meant character likeness, 
moral, or spiritual likeness." 

"Could we have that without having the other?" 

Barbara was evidently meditating. 

" Now, for something we are to do in the matter, 
-read 2 Cor. in. 18." 

Barbara read it, and then confessed that she 
never in the least degree had understood those 
words. "How in the world do we behold, as 
in a glass, the glory of the Lord ? I don't see. I 
never did see, Desire." 

"Christ reveals himself to those who seek him." 



 

" Keveals himself?" Barbara repeated. 

"We look into the Bible; and if the Spirit gives 
us the sight, we see the beauty and glory of Christ 
mirrored there; and revealed in our hearts; ard 
looking at him we naturally grow like him." 

"Not naturally at all. It is natural to us to be 
just the opposite." 

" But it is also a law of our nature, Barbara, that 
we grow like those we live with." 

Barbara sat and stared at me. I asked her, what 
she was thinking of? 

" You talk of loliat ive live ivitli" 

"Yes." 

" What do you mean ? " 

" Just what I say." 

"But really, Desire, nobody lives wltli such 
thoughts. We may have them now and then, 
but we, are not always studying the Bible, nor 
thinking about it. Our lives are filled up with 
other things." 

" And so, we do not see the glory of Christ, and 
do not grow like him. Very true." 

" Well, we cannot." 

"Why?" 

" Did you ever see anybody that did ? " 

"Yes, and that shewed the beautiful growing 
likeness, too." 

"Who?" 

"Mercy Quick, for one." 

"0 but, she is dying. She has nothing else 
to do." 



 

" Neither have we anything else to do. I mean, 
it is or it ought to be the one business of our lives, 
to know Christ; to learn of him, and to grow like 
him." 

" But you cannot be always at the Bible." 

" Please read the first half of the first psalm." 

"Do you take that literally?" 

"And read Deuteronomy vi. 6-9." 

" But, Desire, it would be very poky if we were 
talking Bible all the time. Awful ! " 

"Not if we did it because the words were in 
our hearts. People always talk of what they are 
full of." 

" But it would be awfully stupid." 

" No, indeed it would not. I know one person 
whose talk is always running into Bible things; 
and it is the loveliest, liveliest, richest talk you 
ever knew." 

"Wlio is that?" 

" My sister's husband." 

"Olive s?" 

"Yes." 

" Olive isn't like that, or she didn't use to be." 

I was silent.
