wonder if he--
DR. GAZELL. No. Never. He was above reproach. A hard man to get along
with--willful, but above reproach. I am greatly shocked!
DR. THORNE (stepping out into the crowd). Ah, Gazell! Good-morning. I
am--I am very glad to see you, Dr. Gazell (pathetically).
(DR. GAZELL continues reading his paper. He does not look up.)
DR. THORNE (with embarrassment). Gazell! (He moves directly in front
of the office of “The Earth.” At that moment a new bulletin flashes in
large letters, over the heads of the crowd, these words:--
                           RUMOR CONFIRMED.
                          SHOCKING ACCIDENT!
                           TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
                       RUNAWAY AT THE WEST END.
                MRS. FREDERICK FAYTH DANGEROUSLY HURT.
                  THE EMINENT AND POPULAR PHYSICIAN,
                         DR. ESMERALD THORNE,
                          KILLED INSTANTLY.)
(DR. THORNE reads, and reels; stares about him appealingly.)
(Murmurs are heard from the crowd.)
Enter two Office Girls.
(FIRST OFFICE GIRL starts, and points to the bulletin.)
SECOND OFFICE GIRL. Oh! Oh! (She bursts into tears.)
SUBURBAN. Too bad! He was a clever fellow. He saved my little boy’s life
last summer.
LOAFER. He took a t’orn out av me eye onct and divil a cint did he
charrge for ’t.
PRIEST. Pater Noster in Cœlo--gone without absolution, poor soul! An
attractive heretic--merciful to the poor of my parish.
DR. GAZELL. He drove too fast a horse. And he drove the horse too fast.
I always told him so. But I am greatly agitated by this!
DR. CARVER (reading aloud). Now “The Universe” had it already in type:
“Dr. Thorne was dragged for some distance before the horse broke free.
He was found near the buggy, which was a wreck. The robe was over him,
and his face was hidden. Life was extinct when he was discovered, which
was not for an unaccountably long time. His watch had stopped at five
minutes past seven o’clock. He was not immediately identified. By some
unpardonable blunder the body of the distinguished and favorite
physician was taken to the morgue.”
DR. GAZELL. That accounts for it.
DR. CARVER (reads on). “It was not until nearly midnight that the
mistake was discovered. A message was dispatched to the elegant
residence of the popular doctor. Mrs. Thorne is a young and beautiful
woman, on whom, with their only child, an infant son, this blow falls
with uncommon cruelty.”
DR. THORNE (utters a long, heartrending moan. But no person hears the
sound. He stretches out his hands. The crowd shrinks from but does not
see him. Staring at the bulletin, he stands apart. He raises his
clenched right hand in the air; speaks). It is a dastardly lie! It is
one of those cursed canards manufactured to harass men--and--break the
hearts of women. God!--She has seen it by this time. Let me pass! Let me
go to her! You may kill her with this, but you can’t kill me.
Gentlemen, make way for me! I am Dr. Thorne!
(The crowd pays no attention to this outcry.)
Enter NEWSBOY (shrilly piping).
NEWSBOY. “Earth!” “Universe!” Latest--8.30. All about the accident! Dr.
Thorne killed instantly--Mrs. Fayth still breathin’--“Earth,” sir? Two
cents, sir.
(DR. THORNE clutches the newsboy by the arm, and would tear the paper
from him. DR. THORNE’S fingers grope over it--touch it. He tries
several times to obtain it. The paper remains in the hands of the boy.)
Enter BRAKE, the broker.
(DR. THORNE staggers against BRAKE, who is reading “The Universe.”)
[Exit the Suburban, consulting his watch.
DR. THORNE (more gently; addresses the loafer). Jerry! Is that you,
Jerry! Tell these gentlemen, will you, that I am Dr. Thorne? I should
take it--kindly--of you, Jerry.
LOAFER (stares; mutters). Divil a cint did he charrge me for ’t.
DR. THORNE (addresses the broker). Oh, Brake! I am glad to see you! I
couldn’t get down to save my Santa Ma. But that is of no
consequence.... I’ve been hurt--an accident--and I am confused. I am
suffering from hallucinations. They have got beyond my control. I
wonder if you wouldn’t call a cab for me? I thought Dr. Gazell would
take me home in his carriage,--but he didn’t seem to hear me when I
spoke to him. If you’ll call a cab, I’ll get home--to my wife.
[Exeunt DR. GAZELL, DR. CARVER, and
BRAKE, without replying.
(DR. THORNE watches them with a piteous expression; stands back and
apart from the crowd.)
END OF ACT I.
ACT II.
SCENE I.
A small ward--the women’s ward--in a hospital;
several cots with patients in them are visible. One
patient is in a wheeled chair. Screens stand by the
cots. There are plants, pictures, the cheerful features
of the modern hospital. Two nurses are seen busy
with patients.
Enter DR. GAZELL and DR. CARVER.
DR. GAZELL (seats himself by one of the patients; speaks blandly). And
how do we find ourselves to-day?
PATIENT (turning her face, on which can be seen traces of tears). Bad
enough--worse. I’ve been so upset by--
DR. GAZELL. Yes, yes. I know. It is truly shocking!
DR. CARVER (addressing one of the nurses). You become your cap to-day.
You have an uncommonly good color--I mean to operate on No. 21.
NURSE. Do you really? We thought her improving. She’s nervous to-day--on
account of Dr. Thorne.
DR. CARVER. Yes. Thorne had things all his own way here, as usual. I
mean to operate,--if Dr. Gazell can manage her.
NURSE (coquettishly). You are so expert,--such an easy surgeon. You
don’t mind it more than a layman would carving a Christmas goo--oose.
And what would you operate for--on No. 21?
DR. CARVER. Appendicitis, of course.
NURSE. Really? You are so clever on diagnosis. Now, I hadn’t thought of
appendicitis--in her case. Do you know--I thought it more like pleurisy?
DR. CARVER (looks keenly at the nurse to discover if she is making game
of him; speaks pompously). The nurse, as you have been taught in your
training-school, can have no opinions. Now, the physician--
NURSE (demurely). Oh, of course. I wouldn’t have you think I’m
presuming to set up mine. She might have measles, or the grippe, for
anything I should know.
DR. CARVER. Now you speak very properly indeed.
DR. GAZELL (at bedside of No. 21). Is the pain more severe on the
right?
PATIENT. I didn’t say I had any pain--now.
DR. GAZELL (soothingly). Increasing toward night? Paroxysms? Or is it
steady?
PATIENT. I said I’d got over the pain. That has all gone. It is the
weakness--the deadly weakness.
DR. GAZELL. Just so. That weakness is a most significant symptom--I
think you said it was accompanied by nausea?
PATIENT. No, I didn’t. Not a bit.
DR. GAZELL. Just so. Dr. Carver? Here a moment? (To the patient.) I’m
sure we can relieve all that. Just a little operation--a very pretty
little operation--would set you right again in a week or two.
DR. CARVER (coming to the cotside of No. 21; speaks eagerly). It is
such a beautiful operation! Why, I’ve known patients beg for it,--it
is so beautiful.
PATIENT (beginning to cry). Dr. Thorne said there was no need of
anything of the kind.
DR. GAZELL (stiffening). Dr. Thorne was an able man--but eccentric.
His professional colleagues did not always agree with him.
Enter DR. THORNE. (He has wasted since
his last appearance; looks outcast,
wan, and wretched; is splashed with
mud; still hatless; stands at the
lower end of the ward, gazing blindly
about.)
PATIENT NO. 21. Dr. Thorne used to say that if we had better doctors, we
shouldn’t need so many surgeons. He said the true treatment would
prevent half the surgery in the city.
(DR. THORNE starts, and moves towards the patient.)
DR. GAZELL (soothingly). Yes. Just so. Dr. Thorne had great confidence
in himself.
PATIENT (rousing). No more than his patients had in him.
DR. CARVER. Irritable! Very irritable! A significant symptom, Dr.
Gazell. In my opinion, this extreme irritability demands an operation
for appendicitis.
FIRST NURSE (listening, laughs; addresses SECOND NURSE). Now, if one
could only apply that! Take a cross man,--any cross man,--say a brother,
or a husband, or even a doctor, and if he carried it too far, just call
on Dr. Carver. Why, it would revolutionize society. And he is so expert!
He doesn’t mind it any more than carving a goo--oose. Yes, sir! I’m
coming. (Demurely obedient; hurries to DR. GAZELL.)
(SECOND NURSE moves to the rear of the ward to a patient behind a
screen.)
(DR. THORNE advances slowly; stands in the middle of the ward,
unnoticed.)
PATIENT NO. 21 (louder). I say, when a man’s dead is the time to speak
for him. And I’ll stand up for my dear dead doctor as long as I live.
VOICE FROM ANOTHER COT. And so would I,--and longer, if I got the
chance.
ANOTHER VOICE. He doesn’t need anybody to stand up for him. His deeds do
follow him. And he rests from his labors.
(DR. THORNE smiles bitterly; stands with his face towards the speaker.
He knots his hands in front of him, and thus advances with a motion so
slow as to be almost stealthy.)
VOICE FROM ANOTHER COT. He wouldn’t care so much for that. It’s Bible.
He was not a religious man. But he was as kind to me! (Weeps.)
OTHER VOICES. And to me! Oh, yes, and to me,--as kind!
PATIENT IN THE WHEELED CHAIR. I couldn’t move in my bed when I came
here. I’d been so three years. Look what he’s done for me. (Sobs.)
DR. THORNE (in a low tone). Miss Jessie? Don’t cry so. You’ll make
yourself worse. Go back to bed, Jessie, and--see. I’ll tell you a
secret. Don’t tell the others just yet. I wasn’t killed, Jessie. That
was a newspaper canard. I’m a live man yet. See! Look up, Jessie. Look
at me,--can’t you? (Pleads.) Won’t you, Jessie?
PATIENT IN THE WHEELED CHAIR (stares past him at DR. GAZELL and DR.
CARVER). And to think of the likes of them,--in his place! What ever’ll
become of this hospital without him?
DR. THORNE (with trembling lip). You don’t hear me, do you, Jessie?
Well--well. I must have met with some cerebral shock affecting the
organs of speech. It is a clear case of aphasia. I can’t make myself
understood. It--it’s hard. Jessie? (Louder.) I can’t see things go
wrong with you,--no matter how it is with me. You’ve been in that
chair long enough for to-day. (Imperiously.) Jessie, go back to bed!
Stop crying about me, and go back to your bed.
(JESSIE wavers; shades her eyes with her hands; stares about her;
slowly turns her wheeled chair and moves away.)
       [Exit JESSIE.
DR. THORNE (moves more naturally and rapidly; stands by the cot of No.
21; speaks). Good-morning, Mrs. True. I meant to have seen you last
night. I was--unavoidably detained. I hope you’re not worse this
morning?
PATIENT (with tears). I’ve cried half the night.
DR. THORNE. That’s a pity. But you won’t cry any more. I’ll take care of
you now.
PATIENT (looks up wearily; turns her face on her pillow and sobs).
DR. THORNE. Clearly aphasia. She does not understand a word I say. Dr.
Gazell! Gazell! Dr. Carver?
(The two physicians murmur together.)
DR. THORNE. Gazell? What’s that? The knife? For Mrs. True? Excuse me,
but I cannot permit it.
DR. CARVER. It would be such a pretty little operation. The students are
getting restless for something. I told them--
DR. GAZELL. It is well-defined appendicitis.
DR. THORNE. Well-defined appendi--fiddlesticks! It is nothing but
pleurisy. I tell you, Gazell, I will not have it!
DR. GAZELL (looks around uncomfortably; speaks with hesitation). Of
course, Thorne would not have agreed with us.
DR. THORNE (grips DR. GAZELL by the arm). I tell you it would be
butchery, Gazell! What are you thinking of? Gazell!
DR. GAZELL. But he was a very opinionated man,--everybody knew that.
(DR. THORNE drops DR. GAZELL’S arm and walks away with a gesture of
distress.)
SECOND NURSE (to FIRST NURSE; moves out from behind the screen).
Very invigorating day!
FIRST NURSE (to SECOND NURSE). Father Sullivan’s late with the
Sacrament. I hope Norah, yonder, won’t get ahead of him. She’s ’most
gone. (Approaching the cot of the patient behind the screen.)
SECOND NURSE (moves away). Yes. She’s been unconscious half an hour.
Enter PRIEST. (He advances to offer Extreme Unction to the dying
patient.)
FIRST NURSE. Lovely morning, Father.
DR. THORNE (standing in the middle of the ward). They used to call my
name when I came in. “Oh, there’s the doctor!” “The doctor’s come!” It
ran from cot to cot--like light. And everybody used to smile. Seems to
me some of them blessed me. Now--
(Sobs from the ward.)
DR. THORNE (tremulously). My patients! Isn’t there one of you who
knows me? Doesn’t anybody hear me? Don’t cry so! All the symptoms
will be worse for it.
THE DYING PATIENT. Doctor? Doctor?
DR. THORNE. That sounds like Norah.
PRIEST (recites behind the screen at NORAH’S bedside the prayer for
the passing soul). “Proficiscere, anima Christiana, de hoc mundo, in
nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis, qui te creavit; in nomine Jesu Christi
Filii Dei vivi, qui pro te passus est; in nomine Spiritus Sancti”--
DR. THORNE (softly). Thank you, Father. (Stands silently with bowed
head.)
Reënter the patient in the wheeled chair.
JESSIE (happily). I’ve had such a lovely dream! I thought Dr. Thorne
was here--in this ward. Oh! (With disappointment.)
DR. THORNE. Jessie!
JESSIE (sadly). It was such a lovely dream! (Droops and turns away.)
(DR. THORNE walks apart; stands drearily, with downcast eyes.)
Enter MRS. FAYTH. (She looks pale and
agitated, but quite happy. She is
dressed as before, for the street, but
her head is bare; is wrapped from
head to foot in her long, pale, dove-colored
opera cape. She goes straight
to DR. THORNE, and touches him upon
the arm; speaks softly.)
MRS. FAYTH. Doctor?
DR. THORNE (starts). Oh! Mary Fayth! You? (He grasps her hand with
pathetic eagerness.) Oh, I never was so glad! You are the first
person--the only one--nobody else seemed to know me. I might have known
you would. Where’s Helen? Isn’t she with you? And you weren’t hurt at
all, were you? I have been--anxious about you. Those cowardly papers
said--I tried to get right over and see you. And, after all, you’re not
hurt. I thank-- (Looks around confusedly.) Ah, what shall I thank?
PRIEST. Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.
(DR. THORNE listens with troubled interest, like a child learning a
hard lesson.)
MRS. FAYTH (smiling). I can only stay a minute. I must get back to my
poor Fred.
DR. THORNE. Don’t leave me.
MRS. FAYTH. Oh, poor doctor! Don’t you see? The carriage overturned. I
was badly hurt. I only died an hour ago.
DR. THORNE (gasps, and stares at MRS. FAYTH. He tries to speak, but
can only articulate). You died an hour ago? And I? And I?
MRS. FAYTH (still smiling, with her sweet, mysterious smile). Don’t
take it so hard, doctor. I came to ex-plain it to you. Why, it’s the
most beautiful thing in the world! (Glides away slowly, but smiling to
the last.)
DR. THORNE (throws up his arms in anguish). I am dead! My God! I am a
dead man!
(His face falls into his hands, his whole body collapses slowly, he
drops.)
END OF SCENE I.
SCENE II.
It is night on a street in the West End of the city.
At the right stands a church, dimly lighted for a choir
to practice. An anthem on the organ can be heard.
At the left appears Dr. Thorne’s house, viewed from
the outside. It has high stone steps, and lights are
in the window. One window on the ground floor has
the curtain raised. The interior of the library can be
seen through the window,--glimpses of the books, the
pictures, the table, the lamp with the white lace shade.
The room is empty. Into it--
Enter MRS. THORNE. (She is dressed in
deep black. Her face is drawn with
grief. Her hands are clasped in front
of her. She paces the room drearily.
She is alone. She seats herself by the
table; tries to read; lays the book
down, and rises; paces the room.)
       [Exit MRS. THORNE.
Enter DR. THORNE at the far end of the
street near the church. (He is dressed
as before. He is still pale. His manner
has increased in agitation, but a
new resolution gives more firmness to
his wasted countenance. He speaks,
meditatively.)
DR. THORNE. After all, there is another life. I really did not think
it. (Stops and passes his hand over his eyes; muses.) God knows--if
there is a God--how it is with me. If I have never done anything, or
been anything, or felt anything that was fit to last, I have loved one
woman, and her only--and thought high thoughts for her, and felt great
emotions for her, and I could forget myself for her sake--and I would
have had joy to suffer for her, and I’ve been a better man for love of
her. And I have loved her,--oh, I have so loved her that ten thousand
deaths could not murder that living love! (Falters.) And I spoke to
her--I said to her--like any low and brutal fellow, any common
wife-tormentor--I went from her dear presence to this. (Brokenly.)
... And here there is neither speech nor language. Neither earth nor
heaven, nor my love ... nor my shame ... can give my famished eyes the
sight of her dear face,--nor my sealed lips the power to say, Forgive!
(The organ can be heard from the church.)
DR. THORNE (without noticing the anthem). I will not bear it. No--no.
I will not! I will go to her! (Starts to rush up the street, whose
familiar precincts he seems for the first time to recognize.) Why,
there is my own house! She can’t be two rods away. I wonder if a dead
man can get into his own home? Helen? (His feet lag heavily; he moves
like one who is wading in water. He makes the motions of one who
withstands a strong blast or an invisible force. He is beaten back.
Suddenly he raves.) You are playing with me! You torture a miserable
man. Who and what are you? Show me what I have to fight, and let me
wrestle for my liberty! Though I am a ghost, let me wrestle like a man!
Let me to my wife! Give way and let me seek her! (Slowly recedes, as if
beaten back; bows his head. The man sobs.)
CHOIR FROM THE CHURCH (chant).
    “God is a Spirit.
     God is a Spirit.
     And they that worship Him”--
(Choir breaks off. The organ sounds on.)
(DR. THORNE seems to listen, but with a kind of anger. He slowly
recedes, as if pushed back.)
       [Exit DR. THORNE.
Enter the Veiled Woman. (She stands
mutely and wretchedly. Watches the
house. Wrings her hands, but makes
no sound.)
Enter MRS. THORNE. (Within the house;
can be seen plainly from the street
through the window. She advances
and draws the shade still higher;
stands close to the window, pressing
her hands against the sides of her
eyes; looks out.)
(The Veiled Woman shrinks at the sight of MRS. THORNE.)
       [Exit the Woman.
Reënter DR. THORNE at the other end of the street. (He speaks
shrewdly.) It is nearer at this end. And perhaps, if I didn’t have to
get by that church-- (Hurries up opposite the house. Suddenly he sees
her.) Oh, there’s Helen! God! It is my wife. I--see--my--wife.
(Brokenly.) Dear Helen! (Pushes toward the house. At the foot of his
own steps he falters and falls, still as if beaten back. He struggles as
a man would struggle for his life. The veins stand out on his face and
on his clinched hands. He cries out.) I’m coming, Helen! It is only I,
my girl. Don’t be frightened, dear! I wonder would she be afraid of me?
Perhaps it would shock her. Live people and dead people don’t seem to
understand each other. But I’ll risk it. Helen would go alone and lie
down alive in a grave at midnight, and never look over her shoulder--if
she thought she could see me. I know Helen. I’ll try again. (He
pushes and urges his way onward. But the invisible Power restrains him,
as before. He stretches his arms towards the lighted window.) Here I
am, Helen! I can’t get any farther, somehow.... Come and open the door
for me, my girl,--the way you used to do. Won’t you, Helen? With the boy
in your arms? Perhaps if you opened the door,--I could get in. I ...
(After a silence.) I won’t stay very long. I won’t trouble you any,
Helen. I know I don’t belong there any more. I won’t intrude.
(Wistfully.) Helen! I was cruel to you. I have been ashamed of myself.
I thought if I could get in long enough to say-- (Reflects.) Mary
Fayth went back to see Fred. Nothing prevented her--
(MRS. THORNE throws open the window. Leans out and looks about.)
(MAGGIE is seen moving about the lighted room.)
(People in the street pass.)
(MRS. THORNE hastily shuts the window.)
DR. THORNE (piteously). Helen!
(The organ sounds from the church.)
DR. THORNE (turns suddenly, as if turning on an antagonist). What art
Thou that dost withstand me? I am a dead and helpless man. What
wouldst Thou with me? Where gainest Thou thy force upon me? Art Thou
verily that ancient Myth that men were wont to call Almighty God? (He
lifts his face to the sky; holds up his hands as if he held up a
question or an argument.)
CHOIR FROM THE CHURCH:--
    “God is a Spirit.
     God is a Spirit.
     They that worship Him
     Must worship Him in Spirit”--
MAGGIE (opens the door. The lighted hall is seen behind). There’s
nobody here, Mrs. Thorne.
(MRS. THORNE, wearing a slight, white shawl which falls from her as she
moves, comes to the open door; motions MAGGIE away.)
       [Exit MAGGIE.
MRS. THORNE (softly). Esmerald? He might be out there in the dark. Who
knows what spirits do? Esmerald? Would God that I had died for you! Oh,
my dear!
DR. THORNE. Helen!
MRS. THORNE. If he were there he would answer me if it cost him his
living soul.
DR. THORNE. Helen, I answer you, for I am a living soul. Helen! (He
struggles mightily; crawls up the steps, reaches with the tips of his
fingers the fringe of her white shawl, which has fallen down the steps,
and lies there unnoticed.) Helen, look down! Down. (He clutches the
white fringe to his lips. He kisses it wildly.)
(MRS. THORNE lifts her face to the sky.)
DR. THORNE. I can’t get any higher,--not any nearer, dear.
MRS. THORNE. There is no one here. (Weeping.) There is nothing here.
(She shuts the door slowly and reluctantly; remembers the shawl, which
she draws in with her.)
(DR. THORNE clings to the shawl in vain. Moaning, he kisses the
doorsteps of his own home where the garment had touched them.)
END OF SCENE II.
SCENE III.
A narrow defile or pass between high mountains.
The light is dim. The pass winds irregularly, and is
often rough, but is always upwards. The scenery is
unearthly. No sign of life is to be seen. A distant
storm can be heard.
Enter DR. THORNE (slowly, holding a
staff; he is robed in purple, a flowing
garment, not unlike a talith or a toga.
His face, still pale, is heavily lined;
but more with anxiety than with resentment;
its expression is somewhat
softer. He speaks).
DR. THORNE. I wonder what is to be done with me next? I see no
particular reason for climbing these mountains. There seems to be
nothing for a dead man to do but to obey orders. Well (candidly), I’ve
given my share of them in my time. I suppose it’s fair enough to turn
about and take a few--now. (He smiles. After a pause, climbing
slowly.) I must say I can’t call this an attractive country--so far.
Its main features are not genial.
(The storm increases; there is thunder and cloud.)
DR. THORNE (looking about). It seems to be in the cyclonic belt.
There’s a storm of some sort,--I should say two of them fighting up in
these hills. Hear them close and clinch! Like a man’s two natures;
civil war all the time. And no truce! (Muses.) It’s not a social
region, certainly. I don’t know that I recall, really, ever being in a
place that was so desolate. There isn’t so much as a wild animal, nor a
bird flying over. It reminds me of--what was it? I can’t recall the
words. It seems to me my mother taught them to me when I was a little
lad. But they have quite gone. Beautiful literature in that old Book!
It’s a good while since I’ve dipped into it. I’ve had too much to do.
What was it?
    “Though I walk--When I walk”--
(He breaks off; climbs stoutly. The storm darkens down. For the first
time DR. THORNE’S face expresses something like alarm. He looks about
like a man who would call for help, but is too proud to do so. He
speaks.)
This is really growing serious. I wish I could remember those words. Now
I think of it, we were on our knees. A most unnatural posture! My
mother was a sweet saint,--rest her pure spirit! (It lightens as he
says this.)
VOICES FROM BEYOND (softly chanting).
    “And when I’m lost in deep despair
       Be thou with me....
     Until life’s daylight ended be,
     Be thou with me, with me.”
DR. THORNE (lifts his head to listen). There’s a good musical taste in
this country, at all events. That’s something. What were those words?
Ah, I have it.
    “Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow
              Thou shalt be with me.”
It went in some such way. (Repeats perplexedly.)
    “Thou shalt be with me?”
(Sadly.) A beautiful superstition.
(The storm comes on heavily, with darkness and lightning. Through the
gloom his solitary form can be seen manfully climbing. He exhibits no
panic, but his evident bewilderment grows upon him. He mutters.)
The desolation of desolations! I shall be glad when I get out of it.
What solitude! Of all the people I have known--dead or living--there is
not one to stay by me.
VOICES FROM BEYOND.
    “Be Thou near him!”
Enter, on the pass above him, a young
girl repeating prayers on a rosary.
She is a plain, unattractive girl, folded
in a dull gray gown that wraps her
loosely. Her face is earnest and devout.
DR. THORNE. Why, Norah!
NORAH (looking back). Oh, it is the Doctor.
DR. THORNE. I can’t overtake you, Norah.
NORAH. And I’ve only died the day.
DR. THORNE. But you’ve got the start of me, Norah. You are higher up. I
am glad to see you, Norah (eagerly). But I can’t reach you.
NORAH (holds down her hand). Come up, Doctor! Come up! I’ll help you,
Doctor.
DR. THORNE (gratefully). Thank you, Norah.
NORAH. It’s to Purrgatory I’d be goin’. But you’re the herretic, Doctor.
Which way do you be goin’?
DR. THORNE (shakes his head). I don’t know, Norah. You are wiser than
I am--in this foreign place.
NORAH (holds down her hand). The dear Doctor! Ye were that kind to me,
