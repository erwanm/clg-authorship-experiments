Eminent variety easily occupied that sacred desk. 
The wardens of St. Agatha's have but to say, Come, 
and he cometh who weigheth the honor of minister 
ing in this aristocratic pulpit. In brief, the most 
distinguished men in the denomination cordially 
supplied. On the whole, perhaps the parish enjoyed 
their rector's vacation as much as he did. 

Now, upon the vestry there chanced at that time 
to be one man who was "different." One does find 
such people even among the officers of fashionable 
churches. This man (he was, by the way, a grand- 
nephew of the old lady who built the church when 

Saint Agatha's was an unendowed experiment) had 
occasional views not wholly in harmony with the 
policy of his brother officers ; and, being himself 
a heavy rate-payer, was allowed, sometimes, by the 
courtesy of the majority, when his notion was not 
really in bad form, you know, to have his way. 
He did not get it so often but that he was glad to 
make the most of it when he did; and when his 
turn came to control the supply for that Sunday 
with which this narrative has to do, he asked the 
privilege of being intrusted with the details of the 
business. This request, as from a useful man of 
certain eccentricities, was indulgently granted ; and 
thus there occurred the events which I am privileged 
to relate. 

It was just before Lent, and the winter had been 
a cold one. One Friday evening in early March 
there came up, or came down, a drifting snow-storm. 
It was bad enough in town, but in the suburbs it 
was worse, and in the country it was little less than 
dangerous to passengers through the wide, wind 
swept streets, the choking lanes, and bitter moors. 

An old clergyman, the pastor of a scattered 
parish, sat in his study on that Friday night, and 


thanked God that the weekly evening service was 
over, and his day's work done. He would have 
regretted being called out again that night, for he 
had got quite wet in walking to church and back, 
and the cold from which he had been suffering for 
a week past might not be benefited thereby. This 
fact in itself was a matter of no concern, under 
ordinary conditions, to the old clergyman, who, being a 
lonely man in a forlorn country boarding-house, with 
nobody to take care of him, was accustomed to live 
under the shadow of a " common cold," and who 
paid no more attention to his own physical 
discomforts in the face of daily duty than he paid to the 
latest fashion in sable trimmings in the front pews 
at Saint Agatha s. There was no fur trimming on 
his overcoat, which was seven years old and pitiably 
thin. But he had been invited to supply at Saint 
Agatha's next Sunday, and to that unexampled honor 
and opportunity he gave the pathetic attention 
half personal pleasure, half religious fervor of an 
overlooked and devout man. In the course of a 
forty-years ministry he had not been asked to 
preach in a city pulpit. The event was tremendous 
to him. He had been agitated by the invitation, 
which ran in some such way as this : 




" He had been invited to supply at St. Agath 


. . . "In closing, permit me to say, sir, that it 
would be agreeable to us to welcome among us the 
grandson of our first pastor, that young rector who 
died in the bud of his youth and Christian originality. 
The fact of your ancestry will give to your 
presence a peculiar interest for our people at large. 
But I beg to be allowed to add on behalf of the 
committee, that certain qualities in yourself and in 
your own work have led us to believe that you may 
exert positive influences upon us of which we stand 
in need. In your remote and rural parish your 
life has not passed unobserved. Your labors as a 
pastor, and your methods of preaching, have been 
an object of study to some of us. We have come 
to rate you, sir, as one of the men of God. There 
are not many. In meeting with our people, the 
writer personally hopes that you may be able to 
teach us something of the secret of your own happy 
and successful experience as a minister of Christ our 
Lord." . . . 

The old clergyman sat with his feet upon the 
base of his little cylinder coal-stove. His thin 
ankles shrank in the damp stockings which he had 
not been able to change since he came in out of the 



storm, because, owing to some personal preference 
of the laundress, he could not find any dry ones. 
His worn slippers flapped upon his cold feet when 
he moved. But he had on his flowered dressing- 
gown of ancient pattern and rustic cut ; his high 
arm-chair was cushioned in chintz and excelsior 
behind his aching head ; the green paper shade was 
on his study-lamp ; his best-beloved books (for the 
old saint was a student) lay within reach upon the 
table ; piled upon them were his manuscript sermons ; 
and he sighed with the content of a man who 
feels himself to be, although unworthy, in the loving 
arms of luxury. A rap at the door undeceived him. 
His landlady put in her withered face. 

" Sir," she said, " the widder Peek's a-dying. 
It's just like her to take a night like this but 
she's sent for you. I must say I don't call you fit 
to go." 

" A man is always fit to do his duty," said the 
old clergyman, rising. "I will go at once. Did 
she send any conveyance ? " 

"Catch her!" retorted the landlady. "Why, 
she hain't had the town water let in yet and she 
wuth her fifteen thousand dollars; nor she won't 
have no hired girl to do for her, not that none of 




em will stay along of her a week, and Dobson's 
boy's at the door, a drippin and cussin to get you, 
for he's nigh snowed under. She's a wuthless old 
heathen miser, the widder Peek." 

" Then there is every reason why I should not 
neglect her," replied the clergyman, in his authoritative, 
clerical voice. " Pray call the lad in from 
the weather, and tell him I will accompany him at 

once." 



He did look about his study sadly while he was 
making ready to leave it. The fire in the base- 
burner was quite warm, now, and his wet, much- 
darned stockings were beginning to dry. The room 
looked sheltered and pleasant ; his books ran to the 
ceiling, though his floor was covered with straw 
matting, with odd pieces of woolen carpet for rugs ; 
his carpet-covered lounge was wheeled out of the 
draft ; his lamp with the green shade made a little 
circle of light and coziness ; his Bible and prayer- 
book lay open within it, beside the pile of sermons. 
He had meant to devote the evening to the agreeable 
duty of selecting his discourse for Saint Agatha s. 
His mind and his heart were brimming over with 
the excitement of that great event. He would have 
liked to concentrate and consecrate his thoughts 

upon it that evening. As he went, coughing, into 
the cold entry, it occurred to him that the spot in 
his lung was more painful than he had supposed ; 
but he pulled his old cap over his ears, and his thin 
overcoat up to meet it, and tramped out cheerfully 
into the storm. 

" Well, well, my lad ! " he said in his warm 
hearted way to Dobson's boy ; " I'm  sorry for you 
that you have to be out a night like this." 

The boy spoke of this af terwards ? and remembered 
it long for a boy. But at the time he did but 
stare. He stopped grumbling, however, and plunged 
on into the drifts, ahead of the old rector, kicking 
a path for him to right and left in the wet, packed 
snow ; for the widow Peek lived at least a mile away, 
and the storm was now become a virulent thing. 

What passed between the unloved, neglected, 
dying parishoner and her pastor was not known to 
any but themselves, nor is there witness now to tes 
tify thereof. Neither does it in any way concern 
the record of this narrative, except as the least may 
concern the largest circumstance in human story. 
For, in view of what came to pass, it is impossible 
not to put the old, judicial question : Did it pay ? 
Was it worth while ? When the miser's soul went 




out, at midnight, on the wings and the rage of that 
blind, black storm, did it pass gently, a subdued, 
forgiven spirit, humble to learn how to live again, 
for Christ's sake and his who gave himself as his 
Master had before him to comfort and to save? 
Did it pay? Do such things pay? God knows. 
But as long as men do not know, there will always 
be found a few among them who will elect to dis 
regard the doubt, to wear the divinity of 
uncalculating sacrifice, and to pay its price. 

For the soul of the widow Peek the price was 
large, looked at in our mathematical way ; for, when 
the old clergyman, having shrived her soul and 
closed her eyes, started to come home at one o'clock 
of the morning, the storm had become a malignant 
force. Already wet through and through his thin 
coats and worn flannels, weak from the exposure, the 
watching, and the scene of death, every breath a 
sword athwart his inflamed lungs, with fire in his 
brain, and ice at his heart, he staggered against the 
blizzard. 

Dobson's boy had long since sought the shelter 
of his own home, and the old man was quite unattended. 
True, the neighbor who watched with the 
dead woman suggested that he remain till morning ; 

but the widow Peek's house was cold (she was 
always especially "near" about fuel), and he thought 
it more prudent to get back to his own stove and 
his bed. 

Whether he lost his way ; whether he crossed and 
recrossed it, wandering from it in the dark and 
drift; whether he fell and lay in the snow for a 
time, and rose again, and staggered on, and fell 
again, and so pushed on again, cannot be known. 
It is only known that at half-past two on Saturday 
morning his landlady put her wrinkled face out of 
the window, for the twentieth time, in search of him 
(for she had a thought for him in her own hard- 
featured way), and saw him fallen, and feebly trying 
to crawl on his hands and knees up the drifted 
steps. 

She got him in to his warm study, past the chair 
where the flowered dressing-gown and old slippers 
awaited him, and as far as the carpet-covered lounge, 
Beyond this he could not be taken. 

By morning the whole parish rang the door-bell ; 
the hands and hearts and horses, the purses, the 
nurses, the doctors, the watchers, the tears, and the 
prayers of the village, were his for he was dearly 
beloved and cherished in that parish. But he lay 

on his old lounge in his study among his books, and 
asked of them nothing at all. The kerosene lamp, 
behind its green shade, went out; and the Bible, 
with the pile of sermons on the table, looked large 
in the snow-light of a day when the storm ceases 
without sun. He did not talk; but his thoughts 
were yet alive. He remembered Saint Agatha's, 
and the sermon which he was to preach to-morrow. 
He knew that not one of his people (ignorant of 
such matters) would understand how to get word 
to the city vestry. He tried to give directions, but 
his voice refused his bidding. He knew that he 
would be supposed to have failed to meet his
appointment, perhaps to have been thwarted a rural 
clergyman, old and timorous, baffled in an important 
professional engagement by a little snow. He 
was to have taken the evening train. He was to be 
the guest of the vestryman who wrote that pleasant 
letter. He was to preach in Saint Agatha's 
to-morrow. He was to 

Nay, he was not, nay. He was to do none 
of these things. A sick man, mortally a sick man, 
past power of speech, he lay upon his carpet lounge, 
shivering under the pile of thin blankets and cotton 
comforters that had been wrapped around him, and 


 

gently faced his fate. He could not preach at Saint 
Agatha s. And he could not explain to the vestry. 
Perhaps his heart-sickness about this matter 
subsided a little one likes to think so as his disease 
grew upon him ; but there are men who will under 
stand me when I say that this was the greatest 
disappointment of his humble, holy life. 

As Saturday night drew on, and the stars came 
out, he was heard to make such efforts to speak 
articulately, that one of his weeping people (an 
affectionate woman of a brighter wit than the rest) 
made out, as she bent lovingly over him, to 
understand so much as this : 

" Lord," he said, " into thy hands I commit my 
s-p " 

" He commits his spirit to the Lord ! " sobbed the 
landlady. 

But the listening parishioner raised her finger to 
her lips. 

" Lord," he said again, and this time the dullest 
ear in the parish could have heard the words 
"Lord," he prayed, "into thy hands I commit 
my supply." 

Sunday morning broke upon the city as cold and 




clear as the sword of a rebuking angel. People on 
the way to the West End churches exchanged notes 
on the thermometer, and talked of the destitution of 
the poor. It was so cold that the ailing and the 
aged for the most part stayed at home. But the 
young, the ennuye, the imitative, and the soul-sick, 
got themselves into their furs and carriages when 
the chimes rang, and the audiences were, on the 
whole, as comfortable and as devout as usual. 

The vestryman sat nervously in his pew. He 
had not fully recovered from the fact that his 
supply had disappointed him. Having sent his coach 
man in vain to all the Saturday evening trains to 
meet his country parson, the vestryman had passed 
but an uneasy night. 

" I had supposed the old man had principles 
about Sunday travel," he said to his wife, " but it 
seems he is coming in the morning, after all. He 
might at least have sent me word." 

" Telegraphing in the country is difficult, 
sometimes, I have heard," replied the lady, vaguely. 
She was a handsome, childless woman, with the 
haughty under lip of her class. Her husband spoke 
cheerily, but he was not at ease, and she did not 
know how to make him so. 




The Sunday morning train came in from the 
country station forty miles back, but the old clergy 
man was not among its passengers. Now thoroughly 
alarmed, the vestryman had started for his hat and 
coat, when his parlor-maid brought him a message. 
It had been left at the door, she said, by a 
messenger who brooked neither delay nor question, but 
ordered her to tell the master of the house that the 
supply for Saint Agatha's was in the city, and would 
meet the engagement at the proper time and place. 
The old clergyman, the messenger added, had been 
suddenly stricken with a dangerous illness, and 
could not be expected; but his substitute would 
fill the pulpit for the day. The vestryman was 
requested to feel no concern in the matter. The 
preacher preferred retirement until the hour of the 
service, and would fulfil his duties at the church at 
the appointed hour. 

But when the vestryman, feeling flurried despite 
himself, tapped at the door of the luxurious vestry- 
room, gracefully refurnished that winter for the 
rector with the sore throat who was in the south of 
France, he found it locked ; and to his unobtrusive 
knock no answer came. At this uncomfortable moment 
the sexton tiptoed up to say that the supply 




had requested not to be disturbed until the service 
should begin. The sexton supposed that the clergy 
man needed extra preparation ; thought that perhaps 
the gentleman was from the country, and ah 
unused to the audience. 

" What is his name ? What does he look like ? " 
asked the chairman, with knotted brows. 

" I have not seen him sir,' replied the sexton, 
with a puzzled expression. 

" How did you receive the message ? " 

" By a messenger who would not be delayed or 
questioned." 

Struck by the repetition of this phrase, the chair 
man asked again : 

" But what did the messenger look like ? " The 
sexton shook his head. 

" I cannot tell you, sir. He was a mere messen 
ger. I paid no attention to him." 

" Very well," said the church officer, turning 
away discontentedly. " It must be all right. I have 
implicit confidence in the man whose chosen substitute
this is." 

With this he ceased to try to intrude himself 
upon the stranger, but went down to his pew, and 
sat beside his wife in uneasy silence. 



The chimes sang and sank, and sang again : 

Holy, holy, holy 

The air was so clear that the sound rang twice 
the usual distance through the snowlit, sunlit air ; 
and the sick and the old at home listened to the 
bells with a sudden stirring at their feeble hearts, 
and wished again that they could have gone to 
church. One bed-ridden woman, whose telephone 
connected her with Saint Agatha's, held the receiver 
to her sensitive ear, and smiled with the quick 
gratitude for trifling pleasures of the long sick, as 
she recognized the notes of the chime. With a leap 
and a thrill as if they cast their metal souls out in 
the act, the voices of the bells rose and swelled, and 
ceased and slept, and where they paused the anthem 
took the word up : 

Holy, holy 

and carried it softly, just above the breath, with 
the tone which is neither a sigh, nor a cry, nor a 
whisper, but that harmony of all which makes of 
music prayer. 

He must have entered on the wave of this strain ; 
opinions differed afterwards as to this : some said one 
thing, some another ; but it was found that most of 




the audience had not observed the entrance of the 
preacher at all. The choir ceased, and he was ; and 
no more could be said. The church was well filled, 
though not over-crowded, and the decorous rustle of 
a fashionable audience in the interval preceding 
worship stirred through the house. 

In the natural inattention of the moment, it was 
not remarkable that most of the people failed to 
notice the strange preacher until he was among 
them. 

But to the church officer, whose mind was pre 
occupied with the supply, there was something 
almost startling in the manner of his approach. 

The vestryman's uneasy eyes were not conscious 
of having slipped their guard upon the chancel for 
a moment; he had but turned his head politely, 
though a bit impatiently, to reply to some trivial 
remark of his wife's, when, behold, the preacher 
stood before him. 

Afterwards it was rumored that two or three
persons in the audience had not been taken by surprise 
in this way, but had fully observed the manner of 
the stranger's entrance; yet these persons, when 
they were sought, were difficult to find. There was 
one shabby woman who sat in the gallery among the 




" poor " seats ; she was clad in rusty mourning, and 
had a pale and patient face, quite familiar to the 
audience, for she was a faithful church-goer, and 
had attended Saint Agatha's for many years. It 
came to be said, through the sexton's gossip or 
otherwise, that this poor woman had seen the 
preacher's approach quite clearly, and had been 
much moved thereat; but when some effort was 
made to find her, and to question her on this point, 
unexpected obstacles arose, she was an obscure 
person, serving in some menial capacity for floating 
employers ; she was accustomed to slip in and out of 
the church hurriedly, both late and early, and 
nothing of importance was added from this quarter 
to the general interest which attended the 
eccentricities of the supply.
