Yesterday I was a cable-car conductor, and 
to-day I am a poet ! 

I know of some immortal poems that were 
written by a druggist's clerk, and some by a 
gager of liquid barrels, but none by a cable-car 
conductor. " It sounds interesting, tell us about 
it! " says the reader. I shall, but not to-day. 

To-day I begin the book! 

I did not write that on April 6th, I wrote it a 
month ago — one day when I was thinking about 
this. I put it there now, because it will do to begin; but I had no jests in my heart on April 6th. 

April loth. 

I have been for four days in a kind of frenzy. 
I have come down like a collapsed balloon, and 
I think I have had enough for once. 

I have written the opening scene, but not 
finally; and then I got into the middle — I could 
not help it. How in God's name I am ever to do 
this fearful thing, I don't know; it frightens me, 
and sometimes I lose all heart. 

I suppose I shall have to begin again to- 
night. I must eat something first, though. That 
is one of my handicaps: I wear myself out and 
have to stop and eat. Will anybody ever love me 
for this work, will anybody ever understand it? 

I suppose I can get back where I was yester- 
day, but always it grows harder, and more stem. 
I set my teeth together. 

It was like the bursting of an overstrained 
dam, these last four days. How long I have been 
pent up — eighteen months! And eighteen 
months seems hke a lifetime to me. I have been 
a bloodhound in the leash, hungering — hunger- 
ing for this thing, and the longing has piled up in 
me day by day. Sometimes it has been more 
than I could bear; and when the time was near, 
I was so wild that I was sick. The book! The 
book! Freedom and the book! 

And last Saturday I went out of the hell- 
house where I have been pent so long, and I 
covered my face with my hands and fled away 
home — away to the little comer that is mine. 
There I flung myself down and sobbed like a 
child. It was relief — it was joy — it was fear! It 
was everything! The book! The book! Then 
I got up — and the world seemed to go behind 
me, and I was drunk. I heard a voice calling — - 
it thundered in my ears — that I was free — that my 
hour was come — that I might live — that I might 
live — live! And I could have shouted it — I 
know that I laughed it aloud. Every time I 
thought the thought it was like the throbbing of 
wings to me — " Free! Free! " 

No one can understand this — no one who has 
not a demon in his soul. No one who does not 
know how I have been choked — what horrors I 
have borne. 

I am through with that — I did not think of 
that. I am free I They will never have me back. 

That motive alone would drive me to my 
work, would make me dare anything. But I do 
not need that motive. 

I think only of the book. I thought of it 
last Saturday, and it swept me away out of my- 
self. I had planned the opening scene; but then 
the thought of the triumph-song took hold of 
me, and it drove me mad. That song was what 
I had thought I could never do — I had never 
dared to think of it. And it came to me — it 
came! Wild, incoherent, overwhelming, it came, 
the victorious hymn. I could not think of re- 
membering it; it was not poetry — it was reality. 
I was the Captive, I had won freedom — a faith 
and a vision! 

So it throbbed on and on, and I was choked, 



WEITING- A POEM 



and my head on fire, and my hands tingling, 
until I sank down from sheer exhaustion — 
laughing and sobbing, and talking to God as if 
He were in the room. I never really believe in 
God except at such times; I can go through this 
dreadful world for months, and never think if 
there be a God. — Here I sit gossiping about it. 
— But I am tired out. 

The writing of a book is hke the bearing of a 
child. But every birth-pang of the former lasts 
for hours; and it is months before the labor is 
done. 

It is not merely the vision, the hour of 
exultation; that is but the setting of the task. 
Now you will take that ecstasy, and hold on to 
it, hold on with soul and body; you will keep 
yourself at that height, you will hold that flaming 
glory before your eyes, and you will hammer it 
into words. Yes, that is the terror — into words 
— into words that leap the hilltops, that bring 
the ends of existence together in a Hghtning 
flash. You will take them as they come, white- 
hot, in wild tumult, and you will forge them, 
and force them. You will seize them in your 
naked hands and wrestle with them, and bend 



them to your will — all that is the making of a 
poem. And last and worst of all, you will hold 
them in your memory, the long, long surge of 
them; the torrent of whirling thought — you will 
hold it in your memory! You are dazed with 
excitement, exhausted with your toil, trembling 
with pain; but you have built a tower out of 
cards, and you have mounted to the clouds upon 
it, and there you are poised. And anything that 
happens — anything! — Ah, God, why can the 
poet not escape from his senses? — a sound, a 
touch — and it is gone! 

These things drive you mad. — 

But meanwhile it is not gone yet. You have 
still a whole scene in your consciousness — as if 
you were a juggler, tossing a score of golden 
balls. And all the time, while you work, you 
learn it — you learn it! It is endless, but you learn 
it. In the midst of it, perhaps, you come down 
of sheer exhaustion; and you lie there, panting, 
shuddering, your hands moist; you dare not 
think, you wait. And then by and by you begin 
again — if it will not come, you make it come, you 
lash yourself like a dumb beast — up, up, to the 
mountain-tops again. And then once more the 
thing comes back — you live the scene again, as 



an actor does, and you shape it and you master 
it. And now in the midst of it, you find this 
highest of all moments is gone ! It is gone, and 
you can not find it! Those words that came as 
a trumpet-clash, burning your very flesh — that 
melody that melted your whole being to tears — 
they are gone — you can not find them! You 
search and you search — but you can not find 
them. And so you stumble on, in despair and 
agony; and still you dare not rest. You dare not 
ever rest in this until the thing is done — done 
and over — until you have nailed it fast. So you 
go back again, though perhaps you are so tired 
that you are fainting; but you fight yourself like 
a madman, you struggle until you feel a thing at 
your heart like a wild beast; and you keep on, 
you hold it fast and learn it, clinch it tight, and 
make it yours forever. I have done that same 
thing five times to-day without a rest; and 
toiled for five hours in that frenzy; and then 
lain down upon the ground, with my head on 
fire. 

Afterward when you have recovered you sit 
down, and for two or three hours you write; you 
have it whole in your memory now — you have 
but to put it down. And this forlorn, wet, be- 



draggled thing — this miserable, stammering, 
cringing thing — this is your poem! 

Some day the world will realize these things, 
and then they will present their poor poets with 
diamonds and palaces, and other things that do 
not help. 

I wrote this, and then I leaned back, tired out. 
My thoughts turned to Shakespeare, and while 
I was thinking of him — 

But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad. 
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill ! 

April nth. 

I have not done much to-day. I spent the 
morning brooding over the opening speech. It 
is somber and terrible, but I have not gotten it 
right. It must have a tread — a tread like an 
orchestra! Ah, how I wish I had an orchestra! 
— I would soon do it then — " So bist nun ewig 
du verdammt! " 

The secret of the thing is iteration. I must 
find a word that is like a hammer-stroke. I have 
tried twenty, but I have not found the one. 

— I spent the rest of the day thinking over 
the whole first act, mapping it out, so to speak. 


I have often fancied a resemblance between 
The Captive and the C-minor symphony; I 
wonder if any one else would have thought of it. 
It is not merely the opening — it is the whole con- 
tent of the thing — the struggle of a prisoned 
spirit. I would call The Captive a symphony, 
and print the C-minor themes in it, only it would 
seem fanciful. — But it would not really be fanci- 
ful to put the second theme opposite the thought 
of freedom — of the blue sky and the dawning 
spring. 

All except the scherzo. I couldn't find room 
for the scherzo. Men who have wrestled with 
the demons of hell do not tumble around Hke 
elephants, no matter how happy they are. I wish 
I could take out Beethoven's scherzos! 

My heart leaps when I think of my one big 
step. I have put those pages away — I shall not 
look at them again for a month. Then I can 
judge them. 

April 13th. 

A cable-car conductor and a poet! I think 
that will be a story worth telling. 

I have tried many and various occupations, 
but I have not found one so favorable to the 
study of poetry as my last. I should have made 
out very well — if I had not been haunted by 
The Captive. 

With everything else you do you are more 
or less hampered by having to sell your brain; 
and also by having to obey some one. But a 
cable-car is an unlimited monarchy; and all you 
have to do is to collect fares and pull the bell, 
both of which duties are quite mechanical. And 
besides that you receive princely wages — and can 
live off one-third of them, if you know how; and 
that means that you need only work one-third 
of the time, and can write your poetry the rest 
of it! 

This sounds like jesting, but it is not. I have 
only been a cable-car conductor six months, but 
in that time I have taught myself to read Greek 
with more than fluency. All you need is good 
health and spirits, a will of iron, and a very tiny 
note-book in the palm of your hand, full of the 
words you wish to learn. And then for ten or 
twelve hours a day you go about running a car 
with your body — and with your mind — hammer- 
ing, hammering! It is excellent discipline — it is 
fighting all day, " Pous, podos, the foot — pous, 
podos, the foot — 34th Street, Crosstown East and 
West — pous, podos, the foot!" 


And then when you get home late at night, 
are there not the great masters who love you? 

April 15th. 

Thou wouldst call thyself Artist; thou 
wouldst have the Eternal Presence to dwell with- 
in thee, to fire thy heart with passion and dower 
thy lips with song; canst thou go into thy closet, 
and alone with thy Alaker, say these words: 

O Thou Unthinkable, source of all light 
and life. Thou the great unselfish One, the great 
Sufferer; Thou seest my heart this day, how in it 
dwells but love of Thy truth and worship of Thy 
holiness. Thou seest that I seek not wealth that 
men should serve me, nor fame that they should 
honor me, for the glory that is Thine. Thou seest 
that I bring all my praise to Thy feet, that I love 
all things that Thou hast made, that I envy no 
man Thy gifts, that I rejoice when Thou sendest 
one stronger than I into the battle. And when 
these things are not, may Thy power leave me; 
for I seek but to dwell in Thy presence, and to 
speak Thy truth, which can not die." 

That prayer welled up in my heart to-day. 
There are times when I sit before this thing in 


my soul, crouching and gazing at it in fear. 
Then I see the naked horror of it, the shudder- 
ing reality of it. I see the Soul: motionless, 
tense, quivering, wrestling in an agony with the 
powers of destruction. It is so real to me that 
my body stiffens into stone, and I sit with the 
sweat on my forehead. That happened to me 
to-day, and I wrote a few lines of the poem 
that made my voice break — the passionate de- 
spairing cry for deliverance, for rest from the 
terror. 

But there is no rest. The mountain slope is 
so that there is no standing upon it, and once you 
stop, it breaks your heart to begin again. And 
so you go on — up — up — and there is not any 
summit. 

It is that way when you write a book; and 
that way when you make a symphony; and that 
way when you wage a war. 

But my soul hungered for it. I have loved 
the great elemental art-works — the art-works 
that were born of pure suffering. For months 
before I began The Captive I read but three 
books — read them and brooded over them, all 
day and all night. They were Prometheus 



Bound, Prometheus Unbound, and Samson 
Agonistes. 

You sit with these books, and time and space 
" to nothingness do sink." There looms up be- 
fore you — like a bare mountain in its majesty — 
the great elemental world-fact, the death-grapple 
of the will with circumstance. You may build 
yourself any philosophy or any creed you please, 
but you will never get away from the world-fact 
— the death-grapple of the soul with circum- 
stance, schylus has one creed, and Milton has 
another, and Shelley has a third; but always it is 
the death-grapple. Chaos, evil — circumstance — 
lies about you, binds you; and you grip it — you 
close with it — all your days you toil with it, you 
shape it into systems, you make it live and laugh 
and sing. And while you do that, there is in your 
heart a thing that is joy and pain and terror min- 
gled in one passion. 

Who knows that passion? Who knows — 

" With travail and heavy sorrow 
The holy spirit of Man." 

Prometheus Bound, Prometheus Unbound, 
and Samson Agonistes! And now there will be 
a fourth. It will be The Captive. 


Am I a fool? I do not know — that is none 
of my business. It is my business to do my best. 

Horace bids you, if you would make him 
weep, to weep first yourself. I understand by 
the writing of a poem just this: that the problem 
you put there you discover for yourself; that the 
form you put it in you invent for yourself; and, 
finally, that what you make it, from the first word 
to the last word, from the lowest moment to the 
highest moment, you live; that when a character 
in such a place acts thus, he acts thus because 
you, in that place — not would have acted thus, 
but did act thus; that the words which are 
spoken in that moment of emotion are spoken 
because you, in that moment of emotion — not 
would have spoken them, but did speak them. 
I propose that you search out the scenes that 
have stirred the hearts of men in all times, and 
see if you can find one that was written thus 
— not because the author had lived it thus, but 
because somebody else had lived it thus, or be- 
cause he wanted people to think he had lived it 
thus. 

And now you are writing The Captive. You 
do not go into the dungeon in the body, because 


you need all your strength; but in the spirit you 
have gone into the dungeon, and the door has 
clanged, and it is black night — the world is gone 
forever. And there you sit, while the years roll 
by, and you front the naked fact. Six feet square 
of stone and an iron chain are your portion — that 
is circumstance; and the will — you are the will. 
And you grip it — you close with it — all your 
days you toil with it; you shape it into systems, 
make it live and laugh and sing. And while you 
do that there is in your heart a thing that is joy 
and pain and terror mingled in one passion. 

Yes, sometimes I shrink from it; but I will 
do it — meaning what those words mean. I will 
fight that fight, I will live that life — to the last 
gasp ; and it shall go forth into the world a living 
thing, a new well-spring of life. 

It shall be — I don't know what you call the 
thing, but when you have hauled your load half- 
way up the hill you put a block in the way to 
keep it from sliding back. That same thing has 
to be done to society. 

Man will never get behind the Declaration of 
Independence again, nor behind the writings of 
Voltaire again. We let Catholicism run around 

loose now, but that is because Voltaire cut its 
claws and pulled out all its teeth. 

April 16th. 

I was thinking to-day, that The Captive 
would be an interesting document to students 
of style. Read it, and make up your mind 
about it; then I will tell you — the first line of 
it is almost the first line of blank verse I ever 
wrote in my life. 

I have read about the French artists, the 
great masters of style, and how they give ten 
years of their lives to writing things that are 
never published. But I have noticed that when 
they are masters at last, and when they do begin 
to publish — they very seldom have anything to 
say that I care in the least to hear. 

— My soul is centered upon the thing! 

Let it be a test. 

I am trying to be an artist; but I have never 
been able to study style. I believe that the style 
of this great writer came from what he had to say. 
You think about how he said it; but he thought 
about what he was saying. 

It seemed strange to me when I thought of 
it. With all my trembling eagerness, with all my 


preparation, such an idea as " practise " never 
came to me. How could I cut the path until I 
had come to the forest? 

All my soul has been centered upon living. 
Since this book first took hold of me — eighteen 
months ago — I could not tell with what terrible 
intensity I have lived it. They said to me, " You 
are a poet; why don't you write verses for the 
magazines? " But I was not a writer of verses 
for the magazines. 

It has been a shrine that I have kept in the 
corner of my heart, and tended there. I have 
never gone near it, except upon my knees. 
There were days when I did not go near it at all, 
when I was weak, or distraught. But I knew 
that every day I was closer to the task, that every 
day my heart was more full of it. It was like wild 
music — it came to a climax that swept me away 
in spite of myself. 

To get the mastery of your soul, to hold it 
here, in your hands, at your bidding, to conse- 
crate your life to that, to watch and pray and toil 
for that, to rouse yourself and goad yourself day 
and night for that; to thrill with the memory of 
great consecrations, of heroic sufiferings and 
aspirations; to have the power of the stars in 


your heart, of nature, of history and the soul of
