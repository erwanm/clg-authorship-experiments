And then, in the silence of the night, Bruce confronted 
the phantom he had thought laid forever. He had been 
fancying, feeding his soul with friendship, and out of it 
had arisen the old love. But if ever there had been a 
dream it must be put away, sternly, wholly. The covet- 
ing regard was a snare and a delusion ; he had called it by 
another name, but now he dragged it out to the pitiless 
light. His soul should not be stained with it ; even if it 
took a lifetime of effort, it should be done. He had not 
designedly gone into temptation. He did not see how any 
of this could have been helped, but he had overrated his 
own strength and discipline of mind. The fancied secu- 
rity had been built upon false premises. All the rich and 
sweet associations, all the deep and tender memories, the 
past and the present, had been leading his too willing feet 
over into his neighbor's beautiful fields until he desired, 
with the mad, passionate desire of covetousness, to gather 
the fruit, to pluck the blossoms, and carry them quite 
away. A little more and he might have spoken, or smiled, 
or looked, and told the whole story. Her infinite pity 
would have been touched, perhaps won, for people in a 
moment of mighty temptation do not always consider if it 
is the true, unflawed pearl they are reaching after. Always 
there would have been a shadow of wrong and stain on 
both lives, an uneasy sense, a hiding away in the garden 
at the voice of the Lord. 

He prayed a little by snatches ; it was so hard just then 
to desire to be saved, even though he knew it was the right 
thing. Now and then the other course seemed so possible, 
so plausible. What was in her soul ? If he could know ! 
Had God really joined them together in that completest of 
all love? 

"Save me," he cried. " I am weak and worn with the 
tempest, but do Thou bring me to the haven where I 
would be." 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

THERE followed a week of warm, rainy, and foggy 
weather, and with it a pause in the vital forces of Bruce 
Mackenzie. He could not sleep ; his appetite fell to a 
mere nothing. Yet in his patient submissiveness no one 
could guess the wearying inward strife, the temptation 
resisted so silently that its existence was not suspected. 
He compelled himself to speak of Kathie in the most cheer- 
ful of tones ; he allowed himself to be lulled and soothed 
by his mother's playing, so like hers. He fought Rob at 
chess with no outward diminution of valor, but inwardly 
it was weariness of soul. 

" We shall have to send for Kathie again," declared 
his father, " and compel her to disclose the secret of her 
unfailing panacea." 

Upon this hint Rob wrote, in a funny, melodramatic 
manner, quoting from " Lord Ullin's Daughter," on the 
very first line, with a change of pronoun : 

" Come back, come back, they cried in grief 
Across the stormy water." 

The house was desolate ; Bruce was sinking fast. 
Charlie was in a state of awful uncertainty about some- 
thing or other, and he, Rob, would expect to bring her 
back with him next Monday morning." 

He said nothing to the others, so again Bruce had no 
choice. 

Kathie laughed over the letter. There would always be 
some fun cropping out in Rob. The healthy buoyancy 
of nature would assert itself. 





" I suppose I shall have to go," she said. u Charlie 
spoke of something, but he has two very sick people on 
his hands, and it does seem as if I never stayed at home 
any more. Bertie is so fond of me, too," with a remorseful 
touch to her tone . 

" You might go for a little while," rather reluctantly. 

" Mamma," eagerly, " I 've just had a bright thought. 
Dr. Markham says Bruce must have change of air ; that he 
has exhausted New York." (" Just imagine the immense 
receiver," Rob had appended.) "Why shouldn't they 
come down here for the summer? We have this great 
house and lovely grounds, and only so few people now ; 
then Brookside is really cultivated and artistic. And, 
oddly enough, Bruce begins to design such pretty little 
things. Emma says he has a real artist's eye. She will 
be here." 

" I am sure I would be only too glad to have them do 
it," returned Mrs. Alston. 

" Then I shouldn't be running hither and  on forever. 
It would be terribly lonely for Rob, though." 

Always ready to think what any change might bring to 
another, and desiring the other's happiness. 

The Mackenzies were surprised and overjoyed by hav- 
ing Rob march in Monday noon with Kathie on his arm. 
General Mackenzie kissed her tenderly, and Aunt Ruth 
seemed to lay down a burden at her entrance. 

She was a good deal surprised at the change in Bruce ; 
indeed, for days an unseen something baffled her. He was 
gentle, grateful, ready to be entertained, but he seemed 
holding back a secret pain or resolve, as one does a 
breath in a moment of agony. He would not let himself 
enjoy the full, long respiration of relief. 

Then a little cloud shadowed the exquisiteness of 
Kathie's flawless sky. It brought back the sort of pain 
and secret shame of Eugene Collamore's love, though why 
it should unconsciously connect itself with that she could 
not understand. 





They had the pretty reception-room at Aunt Ruth's to 
themselves one evening, and Charlie explained to her the 
call and its many advantages, and the necessity for some 
kind of a decision. 

'' Rob went up to Mr. Dinsmore's with me one evening 
to dinner : I suppose he told you ? He was wild over the 
rectory and the grounds. This Mr. Copeland is quite a 
middle-aged bachelor, and very artistic, over much, I 
fancy," with a little smile. " But it made me think of you 
and Emma. We never could find anything so near our 
ideal." 

" I am afraid I haven't had any much of an ideal," 
Kathie said hesitatingly. " And it seems so sudden. 
Must you give an answer immediately? " 

" I ought to have told you before. Mr. Dinsmore spoke 
of it a month ago. I thought it over a little myself, then 
there were so many things, and this poor fellow who had 
just died ! Kathie, there was some similarity in his his- 
tory to that of Rob's. He belonged to a wealthy family, 
and married a coarse, designing girl, and his people 
would have nothing to do with him. He must have been 
very much infatuated, for after his wife showed him how 
utterly heartless and unprincipled she was, and left him 
for evil ways, he still clung to her. I dare say he had 
drank some before, but then he threw himself into the 
awful gulf of intemperance, and became worse than a 
brute. I found him in all the horrors of delirium tremens, 
and had him nursed and cared for, but it was too late to 
save his poor body. That was worn out at the age of 
twenty-seven. I think he saw at the last, but he was so 
afraid to face God with the broken fragments, and he 
could not bear to have me leave him. Kathie, we must 
all be thankful that there was enough true manliness and 
true godliness in Rob to save him. I think he will see 
some day just where the strength lies. Everybody doesn't 
come to the full knowledge at once." 





Kathie drew a long, shivering breath. " Oh, if It had 
been Rob" 

" There, do not think of the dreadful picture. God 
kept him for us all, especially, I think, for Uncle Robert. 
He always had a rather curious, honest, rough courage. 
Perhaps God has given him just the measure he needs. 
But, my little darling, we must think of ourselves." 

''Oh, is it right, when there is so much work in the 
world?" she cried hastily, but with the utmost fervor. 

"To a certain extent, yes. You know our Saviour 
said, ' The poor you have with you always,' and I believe 
he designed to teach us patience as well as sympathy, 
patience for ourselves, that we should not rush at the great 
work with superhuman efforts, and fall away discouraged 
because we could not accomplish it all, cure all the harm, 
and sin, and wrong. Mine is only a very little piece. 
And beside, He made homes, He set them in families, and 
showed them ' the better part ' ; He bade them love one 
another. I shall not be idle in the other place." And there 
was a certain bright hope in his voice. 

" But " How explain the strange unwillingness? " I 
do not like to be hurried into anything. I like to look it 
over, to consider. Must you decide soon ? " 

" Yes, I ought. It is not fair to keep them waiting." 

''Which would you rather do?" She asked it with a 
great fluttering of soul. 

" The work here interests me deeply. Still, it will not 
give me the home I want for you, the place where we may 
work together. It would break your tender heart to see 
the sights, to hear the groans and cries, that remind me of 
Dante's Inferno, here upon earth. And it may be a long 
while before any home as lovely as this comes to n s again." 

" I am not a coward," she said bravely. "I am not 
thinking of the fine raiment, or the high seats, and some- 
times in parishes like that there is pride, and coldness, and 
obstacles of all sorts. You can't get to people's hearts, 





you can't do any real work, and if it was this way would 
you be satisfied?" 

He was silent. It had been his one fear. 

' l And " Her bravery was all gone now. There came 
a white flickering in her face, a great tremble seemed to 
shake her very soul. u Oh," she cried, ''are you quite 
sure we are right? that I ought to have taken what I 
did that summer night? For it seems so strange to go out 
of my own life into another's. After all, I have been so 
little with mamma, and to go away from them all ! " 

She paused, with a piteous sob of excitement in her 
breath. She stretched out her hands as if she would cling 
to some sure anchor. 

He caught them, clasped them in his own, and held them 
firm and strong. 

il My dear Kathie, my darling, you are so excited. I 
suppose it does seem sudden to you, but we would not 
come to the real separation until next summer or fall. 
And there may be other chances." 

" There will be. I don't know why, but that seems so 
cold and far off, so finished, and hemmed about, and polite, 
as if one would never get out of the polished rims. It 
catches my very breath. How foolish ! " with a sudden 
gesture of disapproval. " Charlie, promise to do what 
you would like as if I were not in it at all." 

" But you are in it, even here." And a smile of heavenly 
content illumined his face. " You are always with me, in 
my soul, so you cannot escape. I am not sure, however, 
but that I would rather stay here a while longer. So we 
will let it go for the present. When I have served my two 
years we will plan for it. And I should be sorry to go 
away from Rob." 

" Stay," she said then. Some flashing inner conscious- 
ness impelled her. 

He kissed her reverently. He was more than content. 
She would never strive for the gauds of this world, the 
pride of life. 





Rob was surprised at the decision. Aunt Ruth won- 
dered and discussed it a little. 

" I am afraid it would be like getting among the patri- 
cians at school." And Kathie smiled faintly. 

Bruce said, " You were very brave to give it up." 

" I am of the opinion it would have required bravery to 
go," she made answer simply. And he asked himself if 
she understood all that it meant. Try as he might to put 
it out of his mind, some vague questioning would creep in. 

The weather came off oppressively warm, May instead 
of March. Bruce went about a little, but he did not gain 
strength. He would not confess to suffering any intense 
pain, but there was a worn and anxious look in his face, 
and his eyes were heavy. 

So they began to talk in good earnest about a change. 
Brookside was discussed ; then more bracing seaside 
places, as it was rather early for mountains. " A sea voy- 
age," said Dr. Markham. That set them all to think- 
ing. There was Europe and the Mediterranean, Egypt. 

Bruce settled it at length, as he and Rob were poring 
over the map. 

" I should like to go to the Azores. Fayal is said to have 
such a perfect climate. Since I am to live I should like to 
get thoroughly well." 

They considered a little and then agreed, since Dr. Mark- 
ham thought they could not do better. 

"I'm not going to have any sad good-byes," said Bruce 
one evening. " I want all the boys to come in as for any 
other call, and wish me ' bon voyage,' and you and Mr. 
Conover may see us off," nodding to Rob. 

"Thanks, old fellow, for being remembered in your 
will." And Rob made a funny face. 

"It isn't as if I was in the last stages of consump- 
tion " 

"With the sands of life nearly run out," interrupted 
Rob. " The Indian bullet missed its deadly mission." 





"ORob!" 

It was Kathie's tender, upbraiding voice. 

" Well, if he will not let me be pathetic, I must be 
tragic. Tkere is a great fund of unused material lying 
about my massive brain." 

" O Rob, it would be jolly to take you." 

" As jolly as our first tour together to the camping- 
ground of the brave red men of our school days." And Rob 
laughed. 

They settled about giving up the house. Mrs. Alston 
came up for a few days. Bruce held receptions and took 
the good wishes and love. The boys were not over-senti- 
mental, yet it had been a kind of glorious winter, after 
all. 

So they came to the last evening. Kathie had been 
playing some old songs, and Bruce was stretched out in 
the reclining chair; Rob was looking over several little 
matters, and the three were by themselves. 

Kathie rose presently. 

" Oh, we shall all miss you so much ! I should not want 
the suffering over again, but " And she came nearer 
Bruce. 

'' It will be sweet to remember the sympathy and ten- 
derness all my life long. Yes, it has been a happy time " ; 
as if he had to convince himself of the happiness that 
should have been there. 

Then he suddenly held out his hands. 

"This is our good by," he began, taking both of hers, 
and drawing her to him. 

She bent over, and there came a strange light in her 
face, a little flush, a swift tremulousness that she felt in 
her very finger ends. 

" No " He would not let her say anything, but the 

sweet face came nearer, the lips touched his, pure as a 

child. He could not even kiss his parting that way ; 

every pulse was in a flame. He moved the face a trifle, 



and the brow received the secret of the lifelong love. 
Then he just murmured : 

" Say not good night, but in some future time 
Bid me good morning." 

She went quietly out, as in a trance. He lay back on 
the pillow, and a sound like that of waves surged in his 
ears. 

"Bruce, old fellow, dear old chap ! let me call her back ! 
You haven't learned to unlove her all this time. Oh, it 
has been this " 

" Hush, I shall be better ; I am better," rising in an ex- 
cited manner, his eyes burning with an intense light. " It 
was miserable cowardice on my part " 

" No, it wasn't ! " vehemently. " And I don't see why 
you should not have your chance ! I don't believe Kathie 
knows, or thinks. Let her compare the two loves and 
choose between them. Come, that will be on\y fair ! " 

" She has no right to compare his love with that of any 
other! She must take it or leave it, but to balance or 
weigh, to analyze " 

" I don't mean that," passionately. " If there is any- 
thing greater, tenderer, better " 

" Not even then, Rob. If I had not known of this I 
might plead for my chance. But it would be the one little 
ewe lamb over again, the friend treacherously supplanting 
the friend. I can't help loving her, but I can help being 
false and selfish. And I think we undervalue Charlie. 
He has a grandly simple nature, the unconsciously noble, 
the tender sweetness and truth of a woman. I don't won- 
der that a man would love to have him near when he came 
to die ; and if God gave her to him, no one has a right to 
tempt her away. It would be a sin." 

" But if God did not give ? If you are all wrong? " 

Rob was confused and troubled, and his eyes were filled 
with fear. 





" It has the semblance of giving. Neither you nor I 
have the right to remove the seal. If there is any mis- 
take," and his voice shook visibly, " I think God will bring 
it to light, and I am going to stay until there is nothing 
more to tempt me, until I can come in and sit down by their 
fireside, a true, strong friend, and look them both in the 
face with clear eyes. I have been weak." 

" I couldn't do it if I loved a woman as you love 
Kathie." The words seemed almost wrested from Rob. 

" When you come to love a woman placed out of your 
reach," and then he remembered the chain that might last 
for a lifetime, " you will go to God, then, Rob, for noth- 
ing else will be strong enough to save you." 

Bruce dropped back on the pillow, deadly white, and 
shivered as if chilled through. Rob chafed the hands. 

" You are a loyal friend, Rob," said the other, '-and you 
must be true to the end. Promise me that you will never 
disturb Kathie's faith, their faith. Keep my secret ; oth- 
erwise you may hurt and hinder some fine, choice work of 
God." 

Rob winked the tears out of his eyes, but did not speak 
until Bruce said again, " Promise." 

Then he bent over and kissed him, and was still sit- 
ting quietly beside him when the General entered. 

The ladies said their good-byes at the house the next 
morning, but Rob and his uncle went down to see the 
travellers off. Mrs. Alston had a few articles to pack up, 
and some boxed to send to Brookside. Rob was relegated 
to Mr. Meredith's care. Charlie was to go on with his 
work, and when Kathie was quite rested up they would 
talk over matters. 

So Kathie returned to Cedarwood with her mother. 
There seemed a little lull in merry-making. Georgie Hal- 
ford was married and gone. Mrs. Hunsdon had a won- 
derful baby. Eugene Collamore was coming to a graver 
and higher manhood, and, like Bruce, putting away the 





joy that was not for him. A more serious tone seemed 
settling over the young people. Kathie had hours of quiet 
revery, long walks by herself, from which she sometimes 
came in with a curiously disturbed face. It seemed as if 
there had never been time to think of herself until now. 

A very quiet summer it proved. They heard from the 
voyagers, and all was well. What was to come next? 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

THE period had at length reached Kathie Alston when 
the personal responsibility of living could no longer be 
evaded. The happy childhood, full of love, the bright, 
radiant youth, with friends and counsel on every side, ten- 
derest care bridging over the rough places, wise thoughts
