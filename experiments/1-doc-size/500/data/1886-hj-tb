hair was confined as carefully as that of her sister was 
encouraged to stray. She had instantly seated herself, and 
while Mrs. Luna talked she kept her eyes on the ground, 
glancing even less toward Basil Ransom than toward that 
woman of many words. The young man was therefore 
free to look at her ; a contemplation which showed him 
that she was agitated and trying to conceal it. He wondered 
why she was agitated, not foreseeing that he was destined to 
discover, later, that her nature was like a skiff in a stormy 
sea. Even after her sister had passed out of the room 
she sat there with her eyes turned away, as if there had 
been a spell upon her which forbade her to raise them. 
Miss Olive Chancellor, it may be confided to the reader, 
to whom in the course of our history I shall be under the 
necessity of imparting much occult information, was subject 
to fits of tragic shyness, during which she was unable to 
meet even her own eyes in the mirror. One of these fits 
had suddenly seized her now, without any obvious cause, 
though, indeed, Mrs. Luna had made it worse by becoming 
instantly so personal. There was nothing in the world so 
personal as Mrs. Luna; her sister could have hated her 
for it if she had not forbidden herself this emotion as 
directed to individuals. Basil Ransom was a young man 
of first-rate intelligence, but conscious of the narrow range, 
as yet, of his experience. He was on his guard against 
generalisations which might be hasty ; but he had arrived 
at two or three that were of value to a gentleman lately 
admitted to the New York bar and looking out for clients. 
One of them was to the effect that the simplest division it 
is possible to make of the human race is into the people 
who take things hard and the people who take them easy. 
He perceived very quickly that Miss Chancellor belonged 
to the former class. This was written so intensely in her 
delicate face that he felt an unformulated pity for her 
before they had exchanged twenty words. He himself, by 
nature, took things easy j if he had put on the screw of 
late, it was after reflection, and because circumstances 
pressed him close. But this pale girl, with her light-green 
eyes, her pointed features and nervous manner, was visibly 
morbid ; it was as plain as day that she was morbid. Poor 
Ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made 
a great discovery ; but in "reality he had never been so 
' Boeotian ' as at that moment. It proved nothing of any 
importance, with regard to Miss Chancellor, to say that she 
was morbid ; any sufficient account of her would lie very 
much to the rear of that. Why was she morbid, and why 
was her morbidness typical ? Ransom might have exulted if 
he had gone back far enough to explain that mystery. The 
women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own 
soft clime, and it was not often they exhibited the tendency 
he detected (and cursorily deplored) in Mrs. Luna's sister. 
That was the way he liked them not to think too much, 
not to feel any responsibility for the government of the 
world, such as he was sure Miss Chancellor felt. If they 
would only be private and passive, and have no feeling but 
for that, and leave publicity to the sex of tougher hide ! 
Ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy; it 
must be repeated that he was very provincial. 

These considerations were not present to him as definitely 
as I have written them here ; they were summed up in the 
vague compassion which his cousin's figure excited in his 
mind, and which was yet accompanied with a sensible reluc- 
tance to know her better, obvious as it was that with such 
a face as that she must be remarkable. He was sorry for 
her, but he saw in a flash that no one could help her : that 
was what made her tragic. He had not, seeking his fortune, 
come away from the blighted South, which weighed upon 
his heart, to look out for tragedies ; at least he didn't want 
them outside of his office in Pine Street. He broke the 
silence ensuing upon Mrs. Luna's departure by one of the 
courteous speeches to which blighted regions may still 
encourage a tendency, and presently found himself talking 
comfortably enough with his hostess. Though he had said 
to himself that no one could help her, the effect of his 
tone was to dispel her shyness ; it was her great advantage 
(for the career she had proposed to herself) that in certain 
conditions she was liable suddenly to become bold. She 
was reassured at finding that her visitor was peculiar ; the 
way he spoke told her that it was no wonder he had fought 
on the Southern side. She had never yet encountered a 
personage so exotic, and she always felt more at her ease in 
the presence of anything strange. It was the usual things 
of life that filled her with silent rage ; which was natural 
enough, inasmuch as, to her vision, almost everything that 
was usual was iniquitous. She had no difficulty in asking 
him now whether he would not stay to dinner she hoped 
Adeline had given him her message. It had been when 
she was upstairs with Adeline, as his card was brought up, a 
sudden and very abnormal inspiration to offer him this (for 
her) really ultimate favour ; nothing could be further from 
her common habit than to entertain alone, at any repast, a 
gentleman she had never seen. 

It was the same sort of impulse that had moved her to 
write to Basil Ransom, in the spring, after hearing acci- 
dentally that he had come to the North and intended, in 
New York, to practise his profession. It was her nature to 
look out for duties, to appeal to her conscience for tasks. 
This attentive organ, earnestly consulted, had represented 
to her that he was an offshoot of the old slave-holding 
oligarchy which, within her own vivid remembrance, had 
plunged the country into blood and tears, and that, as 
associated with such abominations, he was not a worthy 
object of patronage for a person whose two brothers her 
only ones had given up life for the Northern cause. It 
reminded her, however, on the other hand, that he too had 
been much bereaved, and, moreover, that he had fought 
and offered his own life, even if it had not been taken. 
She could not defend herself against a rich admiration a 
kind of tenderness of envy of any one who had been so 
happy as to have that opportunity. The most secret, the 
most sacred hope of her nature was that she might some 
day have such a chance, that she might be a martyr and 
die for something. Basil Ransom had lived, but she knew 
he had lived to see bitter hours. His family was ruined ; 
they had lost their slaves, their property, their friends and 
relations, their home ; had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat. 
He had tried for a while to carry on the plantation himself, 
but he had a millstone of debt round his neck, and he 
longed for some work which would transport him to the 
haunts of men. The State of Mississippi seemed to him 
the state of despair ; so he surrendered the remnants of his 
patrimony to his mother and sisters, and, at nearly thirty 
years of age, alighted for the first time in New York, in the 
costume of his province, with fifty dollars in his pocket and 
a gnawing hunger in his heart. 

That this incident had revealed to the young man his 
ignorance of many things only, however, to make him say 
to himself, after the first angry blush, that here he would 
enter the game and here he would win it so much Olive 
Chancellor could not know; what was sufficient for her 
was that he had rallied, as the French say, had accepted 
the accomplished fact, had admitted that North and South 
were a single, indivisible political organism. Their cousin- 
ship that of Chancellors and Ransoms was not very 
close ; it was the kind of thing that one might take up or 
leave alone, as one pleased. It was 'in the female line,' 
as Basil Ransom had written, in answering her letter with a 
good deal of form and flourish ; he spoke as if they had 
been royal houses. Her mother had wished to take it up ; 
it was only the fear of seeming patronising to people in 
misfortune that had prevented her from writing to Mississippi. 
If it had been possible to send Mrs. Ransom money, or 
even clothes, she would have liked that ; but she had no 
means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken. 
By the time Basil came to the North making advances, as 
it were Mrs. Chancellor had passed away ; so it was for 



 

Olive, left alone in the little house in Charles Street (Adeline 
being in Europe), to decide. 

She knew what her mother would have done, and that 
helped her decision ; for her mother always chose the 
positive course. Olive had a fear of everything, but her 
greatest fear was of being afraid. She wished immensely 
to be generous, and how could one be generous unless one 
ran a risk? She had erected it into a sort of rule of 
conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it ; 
and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe 
after all. She was perfectly safe after writing to Basil 
Ransom ; and, indeed, it was difficult to see what he could 
have done to her except thank her (he was only excep- 
tionally superlative) for her letter, and assure her that he 
would come and see her the first time his business (he was 
beginning to get a little) should take him to Boston. He 
had now come, in redemption of his grateful vow, and 
even this did not make Miss Chancellor feel that she had 
courted danger. She saw (when once she had looked at 
him) that he would not put those worldly interpretations on 
things which, with her, it was both an impulse and a 
principle to defy. He was too simple too Mississippian 
for that; she was almost disappointed. She certainly 
had not hoped that she might have struck him as making 
unwomanly overtures (Miss Chancellor hated this epithet 
almost as much as she hated its opposite); but she had a 
presentiment that he would be too good-natured, primitive 
to that degree. Of all things in the world contention was 
most sweet to her (though why it is hard to imagine, for it 
always cost her tears, headaches, a day or two in bed, acute 
emotion), and it was very possible Basil .Ransom would not 
care to contend. Nothing could be more displeasing than 
this indifference when people didn't agree with you. That 
he should agree she did not in the least expect of him ; how 
could a Mississippian agree? If she had supposed he 
would agree, she would not have written to him. 



III. 

WHEN he had told her that if she would take him as he 
was he should be very happy to dine with her, she excused 
herself a moment and went to give an order in the dining- 
room. The young man, left alone, looked about the 
parlour the two parlours which, in their prolonged, adjacent 
narrowness, formed evidently one apartment and wandered 
to the windows at the back, where there was a view of the 
water ; Miss Chancellor having the good fortune to dwell 
on that side of Charles Street toward which, in the rear, the 
afternoon sun slants redly, from an horizon indented at 
empty intervals with wooden spires, the masts of lonely 
boats, the chimneys of dirty '  works,' over a brackish expanse 
of anomalous character, which is too big for a river and too 
small for a bay. The view seemed to him very picturesque, 
though in the gathered dusk little was left of it save a cold 
yellow streak in the west, a gleam of brown water, and the 
reflection of the lights that had begun to show themselves 
in a row of houses, impressive to Ransom in their extreme 
modernness, which overlooked the same lagoon from a long 
embankment on the left, constructed of stones roughly 
piled. He thought this prospect, from a city -house, 
almost romantic ; and he turned from it back to the interior 
(illuminated now by a lamp which the parlour-maid had 
placed on a table while he stood at the window) as to some- 
thing still more genial and interesting. The artistic sense 
in Basil Ransom had not been highly cultivated ; neither 
(though he had passed his early years as the son of a rich 
man) was his conception of material comfort very definite ; 
it consisted mainly of the vision of plenty of cigars and 
brandy and water and newspapers, and a cane-bottomed 
arm-chair of the right inclination, from which he could 



 

stretch his legs. Nevertheless it seemed to him he had 
never seen an interior that was so much an interior as 
this queer corridor-shaped drawing-room of his new-found 
kinswoman ; he had never felt himself in the presence of so 
much organised privacy or of so many objects that spoke 
of habits and tastes. Most of the people he had hitherto 
known had no tastes ; they had a few habits, but these were 
not of a sort that required much upholstery. He had not 
as yet been in many houses in New York, and he had 
never before seen so many accessories. The general char- 
acter of the place struck him as Bostonian ; this was, in 
fact, very much what he had supposed Boston to be. He 
had always heard Boston was a city of culture, and now 
there was culture in Miss Chancellor's tables and sofas, in 
the books that were everywhere, on little shelves like brackets 
(as if a book were a statuette), in the photographs and water- 
colours that covered the walls, in the curtains that were 
festooned rather stiffly in the doorways. He looked at 
some of the books and saw that his cousin read German ; 
and his impression of the importance of this (as a symptom 
of superiority) was not diminished by the fact that he him- 
self had mastered the tongue (knowing it contained a large 
literature of jurisprudence) during a long, empty, deadly 
summer on the plantation. It is a curious proof of a 
certain crude modesty inherent in Basil Ransom that the 
main effect of his observing his cousin's German books was 
to give him an idea of the natural energy of Northerners. 
He had noticed it often before ; he had already told himself 
that he must count with it. It was only after much experience 
he made the discovery that few Northerners were, in their 
secret soul, so energetic as he. Many other persons had 
made it before that. He knew very little about Miss 
Chancellor ; he had come to see her only because she wrote 
to him ; he would never have thought of looking her up, 
and since then there had been no one in New York he 
might ask about her. Therefore he could only guess that 
she was a rich young woman ; such a house, inhabited in 
such a way by a quiet spinster, implied a considerable 
income. How much? he asked himself; five thousand, 
ten thousand, fifteen thousand a year ? There was richness 
to our panting young man in the smallest of these figures. 
He was not of a mercenary spirit, but he had an immense 
desire for success, and he had more than once reflected 
that a moderate capital was an aid to achievement. He 
had seen in his younger years one of the biggest failures 
that history commemorates, an immense national fiasco, and 
it had implanted in his mind a deep aversion to the ineffec- 
tual. It came over him, while he waited for his hostess to 
reappear, that she was unmarried as well as rich, that she 
was sociable (her letter answered for that) as well as single ; 
and he had for a moment a whimsical vision of becoming a 
partner in so flourishing a firm. He ground his teeth a 
little as he thought of the contrasts of the human lot ; this 
cushioned feminine nest made him feel unhoused and 
underfed. Such a mood, however, could only be moment- 
ary, for he was conscious at bottom of a bigger stomach 
than all the culture of Charles Street could fill. 

Afterwards, when his cousin had come back and they 
had gone down to dinner together, where he sat facing her 
at a little table decorated in the middle with flowers, a 
position from which he had another view, through a window 
where the curtain remained undrawn by her direction (she 
called his attention to this it was for his benefit), of the 
dusky, empty river, spotted with points of light at this 
period, I say, it was very easy for him to remark to himself 
that nothing would induce him to make love to such a type 
as that. Several months later, in New York, in conversa- 
tion with Mrs. Luna, of whom he was destined to see a 
good deal, he alluded by chance to this repast, to the way 
her sister had placed him at table, and to the remark with 
which she had pointed out the advantage of his seat. 

' That's what they call in Boston being very " thought- 
ful,'" Mrs. Luna said, 'giving you the Back Bay (don't you 
hate the name?) to look at, and then taking credit for it.' 

This, however, was in the future ; what Basil Ransom 
actually perceived was that Miss Chancellor was a signal 
old maid. That was her quality, her destiny; nothing 
could be more distinctly written. There are women who 
are unmarried by accident, and others who are unmarried 
by option ; but Olive Chancellor was unmarried by every 
implication of her being. She was a spinster as Shelley was 
a lyric poet, or as the month of August is sultry. She was 
so essentially a celibate that Ransom found himself thinking 
of her as old, though when he came to look at her (as 
he said to himself) it was apparent that her years were 
fewer than his own. He did not dislike her, she had been 
so friendly ; but, little by little, she gave him an uneasy 
feeling the sense that you could never be safe with a 
person who took things so hard. It came over him that 
it was because she took things hard she had sought his 
acquaintance ; it had been because she was strenuous, not 
because she was genial ; she had had in her eye and 
what an extraordinary eye it was ! not a pleasure, but a 
duty. She would expect him to be strenuous in return ; 
but he couldn't in private life, he couldn't ; privacy for 
Basil Ransom consisted entirely in what he called ' laying 
off.' She was not so plain on further acquaintance as she 
had seemed to him at first ; even the young Mississippian 
had culture enough to see that she was refined. Her 
white skin had a singular look of being drawn tightly 
across her face ; but her features, though sharp and irregu- 
lar, were delicate in a fashion that suggested good breeding. 
Their line was perverse, but it was not poor. The curious 
tint of her eyes was a living colour ; when she turned it 
upon you, you thought vaguely of the glitter of green ice. 
She had absolutely no figure, and presented a certain ap- 
pearance of feeling cold. With all this, there was something 
very modern and highly developed in her aspect ; she had 
the advantages as well as the drawbacks of a nervous 
organisation. She smiled constantly at her guest, but from 
the beginning to the end of dinner, though he made 
several remarks that he thought might prove amusing, she 
never once laughed. Later, he saw that she was a woman 
without laughter; exhilaration, if it ever visited her, was 
dumb. Once only, in the course of his subsequent 
acquaintance with her, did it find a voice; and then the 
sound remained in Ransom's ear as one of the strangest 
he had heard. 

She asked him a great many questions, and made no 
comment on his answers, which only served to suggest to 
her fresh inquiries. Her shyness had quite left her, it did 
not come back ; she had confidence enough to wish him 
to see that she took a great interest in him. Why should 
she ? he wondered. He couldn't believe he was one of 
her kind ; he was conscious of much Bohemianism he 
drank beer, in New York, in cellars, knew no ladies, and 
was familiar with a ' variety ' actress. Certainly, as she 
knew him better, she would disapprove of him, though, of 
course, he would never mention the actress, nor even, if 
necessary, the beer. Ransom's conception of vice was 
purely as a series of special cases, of explicable accidents. 
Not that he cared ; if it were a part of the Boston character 
to be inquiring, he would be to the last a courteous 
Mississippian. He would tell her about Mississippi as 
much as she liked ; he didn't care how much he told her 
that the old ideas in the South were played out. She 
would not understand him any the better for that ; she 
would not know how little his own views could be gathered 
from such a limited admission. What her sister imparted 
to him about her mania for c reform ' had left in his mouth 
a kind of unpleasant after-taste ; he felt, at any rate, that 
if she had the religion of humanity Basil Ransom had 
read Comte, he had read everything she would never 
understand him. He, too, had a private vision of reform, 
but the first principle of it was to reform the reformers. 
As they drew to the close of a meal which, in spite of all 
latent incompatibilities, .had gone off brilliantly, she said to 
him that she should have to leave him after dinner, unless 
perhaps he should be inclined to accompany her. She 
was going to a small gathering at the house of a friend 
who had asked a few people, ' interested in new ideas,' to 
meet Mrs. Farrinder. 

'Oh, thank you,' said Basil Ransom. ' Is it a party? 
I haven't been to a party since Mississippi seceded.' 

'No; Miss Birdseye doesn't give parties. She's an 
ascetic.' 

' Oh, well, we have had our dinner,' Ransom rejoined, 
laughing. 

His hostess sat silent a moment, with her eyes on the 
ground ; she looked at such times as if she were hesitating 
greatly between several things she might say, all so im- 
portant that it was difficult to choose. 

' I think it might interest you,' she remarked presently. 
' You will hear some discussion, if you are fond of that. 
Perhaps you wouldn't agree,' she added, resting her strange 
eyes on him. 

'Perhaps I shouldn't I don't agree with everything,' 
he said, smiling and stroking his leg. 

'Don't you care for human progress?' Miss Chancellor 
went on. 

'I don't know I never saw any. Are you going to 
show me some?' 

' I can show you an earnest effort towards it. That's 
the most one can be sure of. But I am riot sure you are 
worthy.' 

' Is it something very Bostonian ? I should like to see 
that,' said Basil Ransom. 

' There are movements in other cities. Mrs. Farrinder 
goes everywhere ; she may speak to-night.' 

'Mrs. Farrinder, the celebrated ?' 

' Yes, the celebrated ; the great apostle of the emanci- 
pation of women. She is a great friend of Miss Birdseye.' 

' And who is Miss Birdseye?' 

; She is one of our celebrities. She is the woman in 
the world, I suppose, who has laboured most for every wise 
reform. I think I ought to tell you,' Miss Chancellor 
went on in a moment, '  she was one of the earliest, one of 
the most passionate, of the old Abolitionists.' 

She had thought, indeed, she ought to tell him that, 
and it threw her into a little tremor of excitement to do so. 
Yet, if she had been afraid he would show some irritation 
at this news, she was disappointed at the geniality with 
which he exclaimed : 

' Why, poor old lady she must be quite mature !' 

It was therefore with some severity that she rejoined : 

'She will never be old. She is the youngest spirit I 
know. But if you are not in sympathy, perhaps you had 
better not come,' she went on. 

'In sympathy with what, dear madam?' Basil Ransom 
asked, failing still, to her perception, to catch the tone of 
real seriousness. ' If, as you say, there is to be a discussion, 
there will be different sides, and of course one can't sym- 
pathise with both,' 

'  Yes, but every one will, in his way or in her way 
plead the cause of the new truths. If you don't care for 
them, you won't go with us.' 

' I tell you I haven't the least idea what they are ! I 
have never yet encountered in the world any but old truths 
as old as the sun and moon. How can I know ? But 
do take me ; it's such a chance to see Boston.' 

'It isn't Boston it's humanity!' \ Miss Chancellor, as 
she made this remark, rose from her chair, and her move- 
ment seemed to say that she consented. But before she 
quitted her kinsman to get ready, she observed to him that 
she was sure he knew what she meant ; he was only pre- 
tending he didn't. 

' Well, perhaps, after all, I have a general idea,' he con- 
fessed ; ' but don't you see how this little reunion will give 
me a chance to fix it?' 

She lingered an instant, with her anxious face. ' Mrs. 
Farrinder will fix it ! ' she said ; and she went to prepare 
herself. 

It was in this poor young lady's nature to be anxious, to 
have scruple within scruple and to forecast the consequences 
of things. She returned in ten minutes, in her bonnet, 
which she had apparently assumed in recognition of Miss 
Birdseye's asceticism. As she stood there drawing on her 
gloves her visitor had fortified himself against Mrs. 
Farrinder by another glass of wine she declared to him 
that she quite repented of having proposed to him to go ; 
something told her that he would be an unfavourable 
element. 

' Why, is it going to be a spiritual seance ?' Basil Ransom 
asked. 

' Well, I have heard at Miss Birdseye's some inspirational 
speaking.' Olive Chancellor was determined to look him
