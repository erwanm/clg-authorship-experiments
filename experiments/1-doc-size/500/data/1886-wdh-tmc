there were times when he tried to go back with her 
into the life she had led there as a child. Perhaps 
his ardent guesses at this were as near reality as 
anything that could be made to appear, for, after her 
mother and brothers and sisters had died out of the 
wide old house, her existence there was as lonely as 
if she had been a little ghost haunting it. She had 
inherited her mother 's temperament with her father 's 
constitution ; she was the child born to his last long 
absence at sea and her mother 's last solitude at 
home. When he returned, he found his wife dead 
and his maiden sister caring for the child in the 
desolate house. 

This sister of Captain Carver 's had been dis 
appointed, as the phrase is, when a young girl 
another girl had won her lover from her. Her dis 
appointment had hardened her to the perception of 
the neighbours ; and, by a strange perversion of the 
sympathies and faculties, she had turned from gossip 
and censure, from religion, and from all the sources 
of comfort that the bruised heart of Corbitant 
naturally turned to, and found such consolation as 
came to her in books, that is to say romances, and 



 

especially the romances that celebrated and deified 
such sorrow as her own. She had been a pretty 
little thing when young, and Jessie remembered her 
as pretty in- her early old age. At heart she must 
still have been young when her hair was grey, for 
she made a friend and companion of the child, and 
they fed upon her romances together. When the 
aunt died, the child, who had known no mother but 
her, was stricken with a grief so deep and wild that 
at first her life and tfien her mind was feared for. 
To get her away from the associations and influences 
of the place, her father sent her to school in the 
western part of the State, where she met Madeline 
Swan, and formed one of those friendships which 
are like passions between young girls. During her 
long absence, her father married again and she was 
called home to his deathbed. He was dead when 
she arrived; he had left a will that made her 
dependent on her stepmother. When Madeline 
Swan wrote to announce that she was coming to 
Boston to study art, Jessie Carver had no trouble in 
arranging with her stepmother, by the sacrifice of her 
final claim on her father 's estate, to join her friend 
there, with a little sum of money on which she was 
to live till she should begin to earn something. 

Her life had been a series of romantic episodes ; 
Madeline said that if it could be written out it would 
be fascinating ; but she went to work very practically, 
and worked hard. She had not much feeling for 
colour ; but she drew better than her friend, and what 
she hoped to do was to learn to illustrate books. 



 

One evening, after a day of bitter-sweet reveries of 
Jessie, Lemuel went to see Statira. She and Manda 
Grier were both very gay, and made him very 
welcome. They had tea for him ; Statira tried all 
her little arts, and Manda Grier told some things 
that had happened in the box-factory. He could not 
help laughing at them ; they were really very funny ; 
but he felt somehow that it was all a preparation 
for something else. At last the two girls made a set 
at him, as Manda Grier called it, and tried to talk 
him into their old scheme of going to wait on table 
at some of the country hotels, or the seaside. They 
urged that now, while he was out of a place, it was 
just the time to look up a chance. 

He refused, at first kindly, and at last angrily ; and 
he would have gone away in this mood if Statira had 
not said that she would never say another word to 
him about it, and hung upon his neck, while Manda 
Grier looked on in sullen resentment. He came 
away sick and heavy at heart. He said to himself 
that they would be willing to drag him into the mire ; 
they had no pride ; they had no sense ; they did not 
know anything and they could not learn. He tried 
to get away from them to Miss Carver in his 
thoughts ; but the place where he had left her was 
vacant, and he could not conjure her back. Out of 
the void, he was haunted by a look of grieving 
reproach and wonder from her eyes. 



XXV. 

THAT evening Sewell went to see an old parish 
ioner of his who lived on the Hill, and who among 
his eccentricities had the habit of occupying his city 
house all summer long, while his family flitted with 
other people of fashion to the seashore. That year 
they talked of taking a cottage for the first time 
since they had sold their own cottage at Nahant, 
in a day of narrow things now past. The ladies 
urged that he ought to come with them, and not 
think of staying in Boston now that he had a trouble 
of the eyes which had befallen him, and Boston 
would be so dull if he could not get about freely 
and read as usual. 

He answered that he would rather be blind in 
Boston than telescopic at Beverly, or any other 
summer resort ; and that as for the want of proper 
care, which they urged, he did not think he should 
lack in his own house, if they left him where he 
could reach a bell. His youngest daughter, a lively 
little blonde, laughed with a cousin of his wife 's who 
was present, and his wife decorously despaired. The 
discussion of the topic was rather premature, for 
they were not thinking of going to Beverly before 



 

the middle of May, if they took the cottage ; but an 
accident had precipitated it, and they were having it 
out, as people do, each party in the hope that the 
other would yield if kept at long enough before the 
time of final decision came. 

" Do you think," said the husband and father, who 
looked a whimsical tyrant at the worst, but was 
probably no easier to manage for his whimsicality, 
" that I am going to fly in the face of prosperity, and 
begin to do as other people wish because I' m pecu 
niarily able to do as I please ? " 

The little blonde rose decisively from the low 
chair where she had been sitting. "If papa has 
begun to reason about it, we may as well yield the 
point for the present, mamma. Come, Lily ! Let 
us leave him to Cousin Charles." 

" Oh, but I say ! " cried Cousin Charles, " if I' m to 
stay and fight it out with him, I've got to know 
which side I' m on." 

" You're  on the right side," said the young lady 
over her shoulder; "you always are, Cousin 
Charles." 

Cousin Charles, in the attempt to kiss his hand to 
ward his flatterer, pulled his glasses off his nose by 
their cord. "Bromfield," he said, "I don't see but 
this commits me against you." And then, the ladies 
having withdrawn, the two men put on that business 
air with which our sex tries to atone to itself for 
having unbent to the lighter minds of the other; 
heaven knows what women do when the men with 
whom they have been talking go away. 



 

" If you should happen to stay in town," con 
tinued the cousin treacherously, "I shall be very 
glad, for I don't know but I shall be here the greater 
part of the summer myself." 

" I shall stay," said the other, "but there won't be 
anything casual about it." 

" What do you hear from Tom ? " asked the 
cousin, feeling about on the mantel for a match. 
He was a full-bodied, handsome, amiable-looking old 
fellow, whose breath came in quick sighs with this 
light exertion. He had a blond complexion, and 
what was left of his hair, a sort of ethereal down on 
the top of his head, and some cherished fringes at 
the temples, was turning the yellowish grey that 
blond hair becomes. 

The other gentleman, stretched at ease in a deep 
chair, with one leg propped on a cricket, had the dis 
tinction of long forms, which the years had left in 
their youthful gracility; his snow-white moustache 
had been allowed to droop over the handsome mouth, 
whose teeth were beginning to go. " They're  on 
the other side of the clock," he said, referring to the 
matches. He added, with another glance at his 
relative, " Charles, you ought to bant. It 's begin 
ning to affect your wind." 

" Beginning f Your memory 's going, Bromfield. 
But they say there 's a new system that allows you 
to eat everything. I' m waiting for that. In the 
meantime, I've gone back to my baccy." 

"They've  cut mine off," sighed the other. 
" Doesn't it affect your heart ? " 



 

" Not a bit. But what do you do, now you can't 
smoke and your eyes have given out ? " 

" I bore myself. I had a letter from Tom yester 
day," said the sufferer, returning to the question that 
his cousin 's obesity had diverted him from. " He 's 
coming on in the summer." 

" Tom 's a lucky fellow," said the cousin. " I 
wish you had insisted on my taking some of that 
stock of his when you bought in." 

" Yes, you made a great mistake," said the other, 
with whimsical superiority. "You should have 
taken my advice. You would now be rolling in 
riches, as I am, with a much better figure for it." 

The cousin smoked a while. " Do you know, I 
think Tom 's about the best fellow I ever knew." 

" He 's a good boy," said the other, with the 
accent of a father 's pride and tenderness. 

" Going to bring his pretty chickens and their 
dam ? " asked the cousin, parting his coat-skirts to 
the genial influence of the fire. 

"No ; it 's a short visit. They're  going into the 
Virginia mountains for the summer/ A man 
servant came in and said something in a low voice. 
"Heigh? What? Why, of course! Certainly! 
By all means ! Show him in ! Come in, parson ; 
come in ! " called the host to his yet unseen visitor, 
and he held out his hand for Sewell to take when he 
appeared at the door. " Glad to see you ! I can't 
get up, a little gouty to-day, but Bellingham 's on 
foot. His difficulty is sitting down." 

Bellingham gave the minister a near-sighted man 's 



 

glare through his glasses, and then came eagerly 
forward and shook hands. " Oh, Mr. Sewell ! I 
hope you've come to put up some job on Corey. 
Don't spare him ! With Kanawha Paint Co. at the 
present figures he merits any demand that Christian 
charity can make upon him. The man 's prosperity 
is disgraceful." 

" I in glad to find you here, Mr. Bellingham," 
said Sewell, sitting down. 

" Oh, is it double-barrelled ? " pleaded Bellingham. 

" I don't know that it 's a deadly weapon of any 
kind," returned the minister. " But if one of vou 
can't help me, perhaps the other can." 

" Well, let us know what the job is," said Corey. 
"We refuse to commit ourselves beforehand." 

" I shall have to begin at the beginning," said 
Sewell warningly, " and the beginning is a long 
way off." 

"No matter," said Bellingham adventurously. 
" The further off, the better. I've been dining with 
Corey he gives you a very good dinner now, Corey 
does and I' m just in the mood for a deserving 
case." 

"The trouble with Sewell is," said Corey, " that 
he doesn't always take the trouble to have them 
deserving. I hope this is interesting, at least." 

" I suspect you'll find it more interesting than 
I shall, " said the minister, inwardly preparing 
himself for the amusement which Lemuel 's history 
always created in his hearers. It seemed to him, as 
he began, that he was always telling this story, and 



 

that his part in the affair was always becoming less 
and less respectable. No point was lost upon his 
hearers; they laughed till the ladies in the drawing- 
room above wondered what the joke could be. 

"At any rate," said Bellingham, "the fellow 
behaved magnificently at the fire. I read the 
accounts of it." 

" I think his exploits owe something to the ima 
gination of the reporters," said Sewell. " He tells a 
different story himself." 

" Oh, of course ! " said Bellingham. 

* Well ; and what else ? " asked Corey. 

" There isn't any more. Simply he 's out of work, 
and wants something to do anything to do --any 
thing that isn't menial." 

"Ah, that 's a queer start of his," said Bellingham 
thoughtfully. I don't know but I like that." 

"And do you come to such effete posterity as 
we are for help in a case like that ? " demanded 
Corey. " Why, the boy 's an Ancestor ! " 

" So he is ! Why, so he is so he is ! " said Bel 
lingham, with delight in the discovery. " Of course 
he is ! " 

" All you have to do," pursued Corey, " is to 
give him time, and he'll found a fortune and a 
family, and his children 's children will be 
cutting ours in society. Half of our great people 
have come up in that way. Look at the Blue-book, 
where our nobility is enrolled ; it 's the apotheosis 
of farm-boys, mechanics, insidemen, and I don't 
know what ! " 



 

"But in the meantime this ancestor is now so 
remote that he has nothing to do," suggested 
Sewell. " If you give him time you kill him." 

" Well, what do you want me to do ? Mrs. Corey 
is thinking of setting up a Buttons. But you say 
this boy has a soul above buttons. And besides, he J 's 
too old." 

"Yes." 

" Look here, Bromfield," said Bellingham, " why 
don't you get him to read to you ? " 

Corey glanced from his cousin to the minister, 
whose face betrayed that this was precisely what he 
had had in his own mind. 

" Is that the job ? " asked Corey. 

Sewell nodded boldly. 

" He would read through his nose, wouldn't he ? 
I couldn't stand that. I've stopped talking through 
mine, you know." 

"Why, look here, Bromfield!" said Bellingham 
for the second time. "Why don't you let me 
manage this affair for you ? I' m not of much use 
in the world, but from time to time I like to do my 
"poor best ; and this is just one of the kind of things 
I think I' m fitted for. I should like to see this 
young man. When I read in the newspapers of 
some fellow who has done a fine thing, I always 
want to see what manner of man he is ; and I' m 
glad of any chance that throws him in my way." 

" Your foible 's notorious, Charles. But I don't 
see why you keep my cigars all to yourself," said 
Corey. 


"My dear fellow," said Bellingham, making a 
hospitable offer of the cigar-box from the mantel, 
"you said they'd cut you off." 

"Ah, so they have. I forgot. Well, what 's your 
plan ? " 

"My plan," said Bellingham, "is to have him to 
breakfast with me, and interview him generally, 
and get him to read me a few passages, without 
rousing his suspicions. Heigh ? " 

" I don't know that I believe much in your plan," 
said Corey. " I should like to hear what my 
spiritual adviser has to say." 

" I shouldn't know what to advise, exactly," said 
Sewell. "But I won't reject any plan that gives 
my client a chance." 

" Isn't client rather euphuistic ? " asked Corey. 

" It is, rather. But I've  got into the habit of 
handling Barker very delicately, even in thought. 
I' m not sure he'll come," added Sewell, turning to 
Bellingham. 

" Oh yes, he will," said Bellingham. " Tell him 
ib 's business. There won't be anybody there. Will 
nine be too late for him ? " 

"I imagine he 's more accustomed to half-past 
five at home, and seven here." 

" Well, we'll say nine, anyway. I can't imagine 
the cause that would get me up earlier. Here ! " 
He turned to the mantel and wrote an invitation 
upon his card, and handed it to Sewell. " Please 
give him that from me, and beg him to come. I 
really want to see him, and if he can't read well 



 

enough for this fastidious old gentleman, we'll see 
what else he can do. Corey tells me he expects 
Tom on this summer," he concluded, in dismissal 
of Lemuel as a topic. 

"Ah," said Sewell, putting the card in his pocket, 
" I' m very glad to hear that." 

He had something, but not so much, of the diffi 
culty in overcoming Lemuel 's reluctance that he had 
feared, and on the morning named Lemuel presented 
himself at the address on Bellingham 's card exactly 
at nine. He had the card in his hand, and he gave 
it to the man who opened the street door of the 
bachelors apartment house where Bellingham lived. 
The man read it carefully over, and then said, " Oh 
yes ; second floor," and, handing it back, left Lemuel 
to wander upstairs alone. He was going to offer 
the card again at Bellingham 's door, but he had a 
dawning misgiving. Bellingham had opened the 
door himself, and, feigning to regard the card as 
offered by way of introduction, he gave his hand 
cordially, and led him into the cozy room, where the 
table was already laid for breakfast. 

"Glad to see you glad to see you, Mr. Barker. 
Give me your coat. Ah, I see you scorn the effemi 
nacy of half-season things. Put your hat anywhere. 
The advantage of bachelors quarters is that you can 
put anything anywhere. We haven't a woman on 
the premises, and you can fancy how unmolested 
we are." 

Lemuel had caught sight of one over the mantel, 
who had nothing but her M r ater-colours on, and was 



 

called an "tude;" but he no longer trembled, for 
evil or for good, in such presences. " That 's one of 
those Romano-Spanish things," said Bellingham, 
catching the direction of his eye. " I forget the 
fellow 's name ; but it isn't bad. We're  pretty snug 
here," he added, throwing open two doors in suc 
cession, to show the extent of his apartment. 
" Here you have the dining-room and drawing-room 
and library in one ; and here 's my bedroom, and 
here 's my bath." 

He pulled an easy-chair up toward the low fire 
for Lemuel. " But perhaps you're  hot from 
walking ? Sit wherever you like." 

Lemuel chose to sit by the window. " It 's very 
mild out," he said, and Bellingham did not exact 
anything more of him. He talked at him, and 
left Lemuel to make his mental inventory of the 
dense Turkey rugs on the slippery hardwood floor, 
the pictures on the walls, the deep, leather-lined 
seats, the bric-a-brac on the mantel, the tall, coloured 
chests of drawers in two corners, the delicate china 
and quaint silver on the table. 

Presently steps were heard outside, and 
Bellingham threw open the door as he had to 
Lemuel, and gave a hand to each of the two guests 
whom he met on his threshold.
