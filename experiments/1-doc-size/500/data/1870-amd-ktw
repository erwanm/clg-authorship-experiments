was beginning to ache, and little pains kept crawling 
down his back. And he couldn’t help thinking 
that he ought to fight giants as well as Kathie. 

“ I must try to remember,” he said to himself. 
There was quite a wet spot on the pillow ; and 
presently he turned his face over to the wall, and, 
being completely tired out, fell asleep. 

He little guessed how much pains they all took 
to keep quiet. Freddy didn’t think it much fun 
to play alone, and soon came in, and Aunt Ruth read 
him a story to keep him still. Kathie sewed indus- 
triously until twilight, and then went out to do a few 
errands. Fred desired to go, of course. At first 


 


Kathie wanted to object ; but then she thought it 
wouldn’t be much worse for her to be bothered with 
him than Aunt Kuth and mamma. 

But he proved a great plague, all because she was 
in a hurry, it seemed. He would stop and slide ; 
then he fell down, and she had to halt and pick 
him up and comfort him. 

“ Oh, I ’ve hurt my hand ! ” he cried. “ Look at it, 
Kathie ; isn’t it bleeding ? ” 

“ It ’s so dark I can’t see. No, I guess not. Put 
on your mitten again.” 

“ It hurts so, it hurts so ! Oh dear ! ” 

“ If you hadn’t run back to slide, you see, it would 
n’t have happened ; and sister ’s in a hurry too. 
Where ’s your mitten ? ” 

“ I laid it down there when I hurt my hand. O 
dear ! I wish I hadn’t come. Kathie, what made 
you bring me ? ” 

“ I ’m sure I didn’t want to, for you ’re a great 
bother. Let ’s go back and find the mitten, if we 
can, — your nice new ones that Aunt Butli just knit ! 
and she would be very sorry if you lost one.” 

“ I ’ll sit here and cry while you go, Kathie. I ’m 
so cold, I ’m ’most frozen.” 



Kathie was out of patience, and wanted to give 
him a good shaking and a good scolding ; but she 
thought of the giant just in time. She felt around 
the spot where Freddy had fallen, and soon found 
the lost article. 

“ Now, Fred, if you ’ve had a good cry, we ’ll 
run home, and I ’ll tell you a story about a little 
boy ” ; and Kathie made quite a ludicrous affair 
out of his accident. 

“ O, that ’s me,” lie said, laughing. “ I was a great 
baby. My hand don’t hurt any now, and I guess it ’s 
all well.” 

When Rob opened his eyes the lamp was burning, 
and he heard a subdued stir as of supper-dishes. He 
felt quite hungry, and thought of his broth, and was 
just going to call, when a little reflection made him 
pause. 

“ I ’ll wait till mother ’s through,” he decided, 
which was quite a great effort for him. 

“ Kathie, go see if Rob is still asleep,” his mother 
said presently. 

“No, I’m awake, and hungry as a bear. Can I 
have some broth ? ” 

His mother had it on the stove, keeping warm. 





She poured it into another bowl and brought it 
to him. 

He took two or three spoonfuls ravenously and 
then stopped. “ Mother, this is as salt as brine ; 
just taste of it.” 

She smiled. “You would have it made salt, you 
know, but I have some other, only you must wait 
until it gets warm.” 

“ I ’ll wait,” he said, very pleasantly, though it 
seemed to him he would have to eat up the sheet 
and pillows, he was so nearly starved. 

“ Mother,” he said, when she returned, “ sick peo- 
ple are very queer ; aren’t they ? ” 

“ Yes, Rob ” ; and she drew a long breath. 

“I ’ve made you a good deal of trouble this 
afternoon,” he went on, penitently. “ I ’m sorry, only 
I did feel so sure about the book. I don’t see how 
I came to forget.” 

“Very easily on that day, Rob. You were not 
well, and then being so sick immediately after, it was 
not at all strange. That isn’t near so bad as being 
positive when you are well and ought to remem- 
ber.” 

It was a great excuse of his to say that he forgot 



More than once the picture of Kathie fighting her 
giant had entered his mind. He was older, and 
ought to do as much, surely. 

“ When I get well I'll try and he more careful,” 
he said, in a low tone. “ You ’re so good and patient, 
mother ! ” 

She bent over to kiss him, and he clasped his arms 
tightly around her neck. 

“ Oh mother, if you were dead, what would become 
of me ! It ’s so nice to have you ” ; and Rob sobbed 
softly. “When I ’m a man you shall not work at 
all I'll have a nice house and a servant to wait on 
you.” 

“ If I have a good boy, and a good, honorable, 
useful man, I shall be satisfied.” 

Rob lay still for a long while and thought. 
Without meaning to be, he was a great, boisterous, 
selfish fellow, not half as useful as Kathie. Of 
course she was a girl, and — but Rob’s conscience 
told him that it was rather cowardly to expect girls 
to do all the work, and practise all the virtues, 
simply because they were girls. If he could get well, 
Kathie shouldn’t run of all the errands while he 
wa» off having fun. He meant to make her a black 





ring, and lend her his drawing-pencils whenever she 
wanted them. And he wouldn’t laugh at her, nor 
be rough, nor — And in the midst of his resolves 
Rob fell asleep. 


 


CHAPTER VII. 

Freddy’s troubles. 

The next morning it rained. It was Saturday, 
too, and Freddy had to stay in the house. Rob felt 
much improved, and thought he would like to get up 
and have his breakfast. 

“ And while you ’re eating it I ’ll sweep the par- 
lor,” said Katliie, “ if you don’t mind being taken 
out in the kitchen.” 

“ Oh no, I shall like it ; I am about tired of this 
room.” 

Katliie brought out a little stand and put a fresh 
white towel over it ; then she begged her mother to 
let Rob have a china cup and plate. Mrs. Alston 
had kept a set of odd, antique china that had been 
her mother’s, and Katliie thought them marvels of 
beauty and daintiness. 

She washed Rob’s face and brushed his hair. 
Her little fingers were so soft and gentle that he 
felt like kissing them. And there was his break- 





fast looking as tempting as if it had been set for 
a prince. 

“ I didn’t have any toast nor any jelly,” said Fred, 
surveying it with longing eyes. 

“ But you ’re not sick,” was lvatliie’s answer. 

“ Oh, I wish I was ; sick people always have such 
nice things.” 

“And they also have headaches and pains, and 
take dreadful medicine. That part of it isn’t very 
nice, Freddy,” Rob rejoined. 

“ Did your head ache ? ” 

“ Yes, indeed.” 

“ Well, I ’d like to have a headache,” Freddy said, 
reflectively ; “ then I could smell out of Aunt Ruth’s 
nice little bottle.” 

Rob laughed. 

“ Don’t lean on Rob’s table,” said Aunt Ruth ; 
“ you ’ll tip it over.” 

“ And that would be table-tippings,” suggested 
Rob, with a smile. 

“ Do you want all the toast ? ” 

Freddy had edged round to Rob’s vicinity. 

“ Run away,” said his mother ; “ you mustn’t 
stand here teasing Rob.” 


 


Aunt Euth poured the tea. Breakfast tasted ex« 
cellently to Eob. Beside the jelly, he had a little 
piece of meat broiled, and altogether he was making 
cpiite a meal. Indeed, he thought he would have felt 
well but for a curious lightness in his head and a 
weakness in his limbs. 

Freddy was balancing himself on one leg of the 
bench. By and by there was a crash ; over went 
Freddy and the bench. Eob was weak and nervous, 
and gave a jump. 

“ Oh Freddy,” said his mother, “you have been told 
not to do that ! ” 

“ O dear ! Oh dear ! my head is split open ! No, 
it ’s got a great bump. Oh dear ! ” 

“It served you just right, Freddy, for disobeying 
mamma. Now, stop crying ; it makes too much 
noise for Eob.” 

“ Oh dear ! if he had his head hurt — ” 

“ Hush, or I shall send you up stairs in the 
eold.” 

Freddy cried to himself a little while, but that 
wasn’t much fun. Presently he looked up at the 
table. “ There, you ’ve eaten all the toast ! ” 
he exclaimed, ruefully. 





“ And not had enough. Mamma must toast me 
some more, and if you ’ll sit still five minutes you 
shall have a piece.” 

Fred mounted a chair, feet and all. He wore 
a pair of old shoes because they were so much 
less noisy than his boots ; and now he espied the 
string dangling from one, and thought he would 
take a quiet play at horse while he was waiting. 
So he trotted the one foot up and down, holding 
the strings as reins ; and though lie did want to 
sing out, “ Two forty on the plank-road,” by a great 
effort he managed to say it softly, though it was 
n’t half as good. The pony came home, and he 
tied him up in the stable. This process was fas- 
tening the strings to the chair-back. 

“ Isn’t it five minutes ? ” he asked, looking round. 

“ Hot quite ; but you ’ve been a tolerably good 
boy, so here ’s some toast and jelly.” 

Fred gave a bound of delight. Alas ! down he 
came sprawling on the floor, with the chair over him. 
Pony, at this juncture, broke the rein, and freed him- 
self by a vigorous kick. 

“ Oh Fred ! what is the matter ? ” and his mother 
picked him up. He cried pretty hard at first ; but, 


 


finding that lie was not much hurt, began to vary 
the exercises hy talking at the same time. A queer 
jumble he made of his horse in the stable and 
the toast ; and it was some time before matters 
could be explained satisfactorily. 

Rob laughed till the tears came in his eyes, the 
affair seemed so comical to him. 

“ Keeping a fast horse is rather dangerous, Fred ; 
and trying to keep you still is almost impossible.” 

“ But I was still. I never spoke a word but softly, 
and I didn’t make a bit of noise.” 

“ And came down with a crash at last. Since you 
didn’t break your neck nor the chair, we ’ll try to stop 
your mouth with the toast, and be thankful ; only next 
time you fall I think you ’ll split my head open.” 

Fred looked as if he was considering how it could 
be done. His mother tied his shoe, wiped the tears 
from his face, and gave him strict injunctions about 
his future behavior. Then he was allowed to have 
the toast and jelly. 

" Now,” said Aunt Ruth, “ suppose you get your 
picture-book and sit down on the floor a little while. 
You can’t very well fall there.” 

Freddy obeyed with alacrity. 





“ Aunt Ruth, here ’s Harry and his dog. The dog 
pulled Harry out of the water and he gave him a sil- 
ver collar.” 

" Who, the dog ? ” asked Rob. 

“ Yes, the dog.” 

“ And the dog led Harry around by a chain which 
was fast to the silver collar ! ” 

“ Ho, he didn’t ; Harry led the dog. I ’m telling 
Aunt Ruth, not you.” 

Rob concluded he would try the lounge awhile. 
He could begin to help himself. 

Fred went on with his story, raising his voice at 
every new sentence. 

“ Hot quite so loud,” said Rob. 

“ I ’ve read my book all through,” Fred began 
presently. “ Can ’t I play with my blocks ? ” 

“ I ’m afraid you will make too much noise.” 

“Ho, I won’t. I ’ll be just as still as a mouse or a 
squirrel.” 

“ We ’ll take the mouse part,” said Rob. 

So Fred began to build a tower. Of course, before 
he could get the top block on, down came the whole 
edifice with a crash. Rob, being just on the point of 
a doze, nearly sprang “ out of his skin.” 


 


“ Oh ! ” Fred exclaimed, aghast. “ I was so sure it 
wouldn’t tumble down ! ” 

“ Don’t build a high one,” said Aunt Ruth, softly. 

“ Just one more, auntie. I ’ll be very sure that it 
won’t fall down.” 

“ No, not one.” 

Fred knew he must obey that tone. At first he had 
a mind to kick the blocks to the four corners of the 
room, but a second thought warned him that such a 
course would not be prudent. But somehow he could 
n’t get any low houses to suit. Presently he made a 
long inclined plane, when a happy thought popped 
into his head. He went very softly to his box, so as 
not to wake up Rob, took out some marbles and 
dropped them down the little square at the upper 
end. They rattled along, fell off the step at the bot- 
tom and rolled round the floor. 

“ Oh Freddy ! ” said Rob, “ you are the noisiest boy 
that I ever saw.” 

“ It ’s real mean for you to be sick ! A fellow 
can’t have any fun at all ! ” and Fred gave the nearest 
marble a vigorous kick that made it bound up 
against the wall. 

Katliie had finished the parlor, and was going up 
stairs to sweep. 





“ I guess I ’ll take Fred along and amuse him,” 
she said, “ and maybe Rob can get asleep.” 

Freddy was delighted. He trudged up stairs, carry- 
ing the dust-brush as a great favor. Kathie made the 
beds, put away a pile of clean clothes, and then began 
to sweep. Freddy would run, to be sure, and when 
he helped dust, for he was delighted to work with 
Kathie, it proved a rather noisy operation, though she 
hoped they did not hear the sound very plainly down 
stairs. 

She had just finished the rooms and put her dust- 
pan in the little square hall, when Freddy, who was 
following fast upon her and asking a multitude of 
questions, stepped upon something that tilted and 
made him jump. Clatter, clatter went the pan down 
stairs, bumping every step and spilling the dust. 

“ You put it right there in the way,” began Fred, 
anxious to justify himself. 

“ I didn’t think it was going to be in the way. I 
quite forgot about an unlucky little boy who meets 
with accidents on every side.” 

“ That ’s because Rob ’s sick.” 

“ The very reason why we ought to be still.” 

“ But don’t you know everything always happens 


 


when you don’t want it ? ” said Fred, with great 
earnestness. 

" I believe it does. Now I ’ve. only the stairs to 
sweep, and you ’ll be in my way. Eun in the kitchen 
and be just as good as you can until I come.” 

Fred went very reluctantly. 

"Well, General,” said Eob, "what was the last 
explosion ? ” 

“ There wasn’t any — any — splutter,” Fred re- 
turned, slowly. 

A 

"We heard a great one and thought you had knocked 
the chimney over. Or was it you bouncing down 
stairs ? ” 

Fred looked rather sulky and made no answer. It 
was a fine thing for Eob to lie abed and scold about 
everybody. 

" I think Fred is the noisiest boy that was ever 
created,” Eob went on ; " don’t you, mother ? ” 

“ Boys in general have a faculty of making a racket 
very easily.” 

" Don’t you, Aunt Euth ? ” 

Aunt Euth smiled. Just then Kathie entered the 
room. 

" I ’ll leave it to you all,” said Eob, " if Fred doesn’t
