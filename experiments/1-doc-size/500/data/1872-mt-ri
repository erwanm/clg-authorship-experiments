you're heaving too taut. Y on promised to show me that stunner,
and I walked more than eleven mile with you through the 
cussedest jungle I ever see, a hunting for it ; but the tree you 
showed me finally warn't as big around as a beer cask, and you 
know that your own self, Markiss." 

" Hear the man talk ! Of course the tree was reduced that 
way, but didn't I explain it ? Answer me, didn't I ? Didn't 
I say I wished you could have seen it when I first saw it ? 
When you got up on your ear and called me names, and said 
I had brought you eleven miles to look at a sapling, didn't I 
explain to you that all the whale-ships in the North Seas had 
been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years ? And 
did you s'pose the tree could last ior-emr, con-found it ? I 

don't see why yon want to keep back things that way, and try 
to injnre a person that's never done you any harm." 

Somehow this man's presence made me uncomfortable, and 
I was ghid when a native arrived at that moment to say that 


Muckawow, the most companionable and luxurious among the 
rude war-chiefs of the Islands, desired us to come over and help 
him enjoy a missionary whom he had found trespassing on his 
grounds. 

I think it was about ten days afterward that, as I finished a 
statement I was making for the instruction of a group of friends 
and acquaintances, and which made no pretence of being extraordinary,
a famihar voice chimed instantly in on the heels of 
my last word, and said : 

" But, my dear sir, there was notJiing remarkable about that 
horse, or the circumstance either — nothing in the world ! I 
mean no sort of offence when I say it, sir, but you really do 
not know anything whatever about speed. Bless your heart, 
if you could only have seen my mare Margaretta ; there was a 
beast ! — there was lightning for you ! Trot ! Trot is no name 

for it — she flew ! How she could whirl a bnggy along ! I 
started her out onee, sir — Colonel Bilgewater, you recollect 
that animal perfectly well— I started her out about thirty or 
thirty-live yards ahead of the awfullest storm I ever saw in my 
life, and it chased us upwards of eighteen miles ! It did, by 
the everlasting hills ! And I'm telling you nothing but the 
imvarnished truth when I say that not one single drop of rain 
fell on me — not a single drop sir ! And I swear to it ! But 
my dog was a-swimming behind the wagon all the way !" 

For a week or two I stayed mostly within doors, for I seemed 
to meet this person everywhere, and he had become utterly 
hateful to me. But one evening I dropped in on Captain Perkins 
and his friends, and we had a sociable time. About ten 
o'clock I chanced to be talking about a merchant friend of 
mine, and without really intending it, the remark slipped out 
that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his 
•workmen. Instantly, through the steam of a hot whiskey 
punch on the opposite side of the room, a remembered voice 
shot — and for a moment I trembled on the imminent verge of 
profanity : 

" Oh, my dear sir, really you expose yourself when you parade 
that as a surprising circumstance. Bless your heart and hide, 
you are ignorant of the very A B C of meanness ! ignorant as 
the unborn babe ! ignorant as unborn tivins ! You don't know 
any thing about it ! It is pitiable to see you, sir, a well-spoken 
and prepossessing stranger, making such an enormous pow-wow 
here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is perfectly 
humiliating ! Look me in the eye, if you please ; look 
me in the eye. John James Godfrey was the son of poor but 
honest parents in the State of Mississippi — boyhood friend of 
mine — bosom comrade in later years. Heaven rest his noble 
spirit, he is gone from us now. John James Godfrey was hired 
by the Hayblossom Mining Company in California to do some 
blasting for them — the " Incorporated Company of Mean Men," 
the boys used to call it. 
"Well, one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep 
and put in an awful blast 
of powder, and was standing over it ramming it 
down with an iron crowbar about nine foot long, when 
the cussed thing struck a spark and hred the powder, 
and scat ! away John Godfrey whizzed like a sky-rocket, him and his crow- 
bar ! Well, sir, he kept on going up in the air 
higher and higher, till he didn't look any bigger than 
a boy — and he kept going on up higher and higher, 
till he didn't look any bigger than a doll — and he kept on going up higher and higher, 
till he didn't look any bigger than a little small bee — and then 

he went out of sight ! Presently he came in sight again, look- 
ing like a little small bee — and he came along down further 
and further, till he looked as big as a doll again — and down 
farther and farther, till he was as big as a boy again — and 
further and farther, till he was a full-sized man once more ; and 
then him and his crowbar came awh-izzing down and lit right 
exactly in the same old tracks and went to r-ramming down, 
and r-ramming down, and r-ramming down again, just the same 
as if nothing had happened! Now do you know, that poor 
cuss warn't gone only sixteen minutes, and yet that Incorpo- 
rated Company of Mean Men docked hei for the lost time !' 

I said I had the headache, and so excused myself and went 
home. And on my diary I entered " another night spoiled ' 
by this oflensive loafer. And a fervent curse was set down 
with it to keep the item company. And the very next day I 
packed up, out of all patience, and left the Island. 

Almost from the very beginning, I regarded that man as a 
liar. 

The line of points represents an interval of years. At the 
end of which time the opinion hazarded in that last sentence 
came to be gratify ingly and remarkably- endorsed, and by 
wholly disinterested persons. The man Markiss was found 
one morning hanging to abeam of his own bedroom (the doors 
and windows securely fastened on the inside), dead ; and on 
his breast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging 
his friends to suspect no innocent person of having any thing 
to do with his death, for that it was the work of his own hands 
entirely. Yet the jury brought in the astounding verdict that 
deceased came to his death " by the hands of some person or 
persons unknown !" They explained that the perfectly unde- 
viating consistency of Markiss's character for thirty years tow- 
ered aloft as colossal and indestructible testimony, that what- 
ever statement he chose to make was entitled to instant and 
unqyestioning acceptance as a lie. And they furthermore 
stated their belief that he was not dead, and instanced the 

strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he vjas 
dead — and beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long 
as possible, which was done. And so in the tropical climate 
of Lahaina the coffin stood open for seven days, and then even 
the loyal jury gave him up. But they sat on him again, and 
changed their verdict to " suicide induced by mental aberra- 
tion " — because, said they, with penetration, " he said he was 
dead, and he was dead ; and would he have told the truth if 
he had been in his right mind ? yes sir." 




CHAPTEE LXXVIII. 

AFTER half a year's luxurious vagrancy in the islands, I 
took shipping in a sailing vessel, and regretfully re- 
turned to San Francisco — a voyage in every way delightful, 
but without an incident : unless lying two long weeks in a dead 
calm, eighteen hundred miles from the nearest land, may rank 
as an incident. Schools of whales grew so tame that day after 
day they played about the ship among the porpoises and the 
sharks without the least apparent fear of us, and we pelted them 
with empty bottles for lack of better sport. Twenty-four hours 
afterward these bottles would be still lying on the glassy water 
under our noses, showing that the ship had not moved out of 
her place in all that time. The calm was absolutely breathless, 
and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle. For a 
whole day and part of a night we lay so close to another ship 
that had drifted to our vicinity, that we carried on conver- 
sations with her passengers, introduced each other by name, and 
became pretty intimately acquainted with people we had never 
heard of before, and have never heard of since. This was the 
only vessel we saw during the whole lonely voyage. We had 
fifteen passengers, and to show how hard pressed they were at 
last for occupation and amusement, I will mention that the 
gentlemen gave a good part of their time every day, during the 
calm, to trying to sit on an empty champagne bottle (lying on 
its side), and thread a needle without touching their heels to 
the deck, or falling over ; and the ladies sat in the shade of the 
mainsail, and watched the enterprise with absorbing interest. 
We were at sea five Sundays ; and yet, but for the almanac 
we never would have known but that all the other days were 
Sundays too. 



I was home again, in 
San Francisco, without means and without em- 
ployment. I tortured my brain for a saving scheme 
of some kind, and at last a public lecture occurred 
to me! I sat down and wrote one, in a fever of 
hopeful anticipation. I showed it to several friends, 
but they all shook their heads.



They said nobody would come to hear me, 
and I would make a humiliating failure of it. 
They said that as I had never spoken in public, I 
would break down in the delivery, anyhow. I was disconsolate 
now. But at last an editor slapped me on the back and told 
me to "go ahead." He said, " Take the largest house in town, 
and charge a dollar a ticket." The audacity of the proposition 
was charming ; it seemed fraught with practical worldly wisdom, 
however. The proprietor of the several theatres endorsed 
the advice, and said I might have his handsome new opera-house 
at half price — fifty dollars. In sheer desperation I took it — on 
credit, for sufficient reasons. In three days I did a hundred and 
fifty dollars' worth of printing and advertising, and was the 
most distressed and friglitened creature on the Pacific coast. I 
could not sleep — who could, under such circumstances ? For 
other people there was facetiousness in the last line of my 
posters, but to me it was plaintive with a pang when I wrote it ; 

" Doors open at 7. The trouble will begin at 8." 

That line has done good service since borrowed it frequently 
newspaper advertisement reminding school pupils in vacation 
what time next term would begin. As those three days of 
suspense dragged by, I grew more and more unhappy. I had 
sold two hundred tickets among my personal friends, but I feared 
they might not come. My lecture, which had seemed "humor- 
ous" to me, at first, grew steadily more and more dreary, till 
not a vestige of fun seemed left, and I grieved that I could not 
bring a coffin on the stage and turn the thing into a funeral. 
I was so panic-stricken, at last, that I went to three old friends, 
giants in stature, cordial by nature, and stormy-voiced, and said : 

" This thing is going to be a failure ; the jokes in it are so 
•dim that nobody will ever see them ; I would like to have you 
sit in the parquette, and help me through." 

They said they would. Then I went to the wife of a pop- 
ular citizen, and said that if she was willing to do me a very 
great kindness, I would be glad if she and her husband would 
sit prominently in the left-hand stage-box, where the whole 
house could see them. I explained that I should need help, and 
would turn toward her and smile, as a signal, when I had been 
delivered of an obscure joke — " and then," I added, " don't 
wait to investigate, but respond ! " 

Slie promised. Down the street I met a man I never had 
seen before. He had been drinking, and xas beaming with 
smiles and good nature. He said : 

" My name's Sawjer. You don't know me, but that don't 
matter. I haven't got a cent, but if you knew how bad I wanted 
to laugh, you'd give me a ticket. Come, now, what do you 
say ? " 

" Is your laugh hung on a hair-trigger ? — that is, is it critical, 
or can you get it off easy ? " 

My drawling infirniity of speech so affected him that he 
laughed a specimen or two that struck me as being about the 
article I wanted, and I gave him a ticket, and appointed him to 
sit in the second circle, in the centre, and be responsible for 
that division of the house. I gave him minute instructions 
about how to detect indistinct jokes, and then went away, and 
left him chuckling placidly over the novelty of the idea. 




I ate nothing on the last of the three eventful days — I only 
suffered. I had advertised that on this third day the box-office 
would be opened for the sale of reserved seats. I crept down 
to the theatre at fom* in the afternoon to see if any sales had 
been made. The ticket seller was gone, the box-office was 
locked up. I had to swallow suddenly, or my heart would have 
got out. " N'o sales," I said to myself; " I might have known 
it." I thought of suicide, pretended illness, flight. I thought 
of these things in earnest, for I was very miserable and scared. 
But of course I had to drive them away, and prepare to meet my 
fate. I could not wait for half-past seven — I wanted to face the 
horror, and end it — the feeling of many a man doomed to hang, 

no doubt. I went down 
back streets at six o'clock, 
and entered the tlieitre by 
the back door. I stumbled 
my way in the dark among the ranks of canvas scenery,
and stood on the stage. The house was gloomy and silent, 
and its emptiness depressing. I went 
into the dark among the 
scenes again, and for an 
hour and a half gave myself 
up to the horrors, wholly 
unconscious of everything 
else. Then I heard a murmur; it rose higher and 
higher, and ended in a crash, mingled with cheers. 
It made ray hair raise, it 
was so close to me, and so loud. There was a pause, 
and then another ; presently came a thii-d, and before I well knew what I was about, I 

was in the middle of the stage, staring at a sea of taces, bewildered 
by the fierce glare of the lights, and quaking in every limb 
with a terror that seemed like to take my life away. The 
bouse was full, aisles and all ! 

The tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full 
minute before I could gain any command over myself. Then 
I recognized the charity and the friendliness in the faces before 
me, and little by little my fright melted away, and I began to 




talk Within three or four minutes I was comfortable, and 
even content. My three chief allies, with three auxiliaries, 
were on hand, in the parquette, all sitting together, all armed 

with bludgeons, and all 
ready to make an onslaught 
upon the feeblest joke that might show its head. And 
whenever a joke did fall their bludgeons came down 
and their faces seemed to 
split from ear to ear ; Sawyer, whose hearty counte- 
nance was seen looming redly in the centre of the 
second circle, took it up, and the house was carried 
handsomely. Inferiorjokes 
never tared so royally before. Presently I delivered a bit of 

serious matter with impressive unction (it was my pet), and 
the audience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me 
more than any applause ; and as I dropped the last word of 

the clause, I happened to turn and catch Mrs. 's intent 

and waiting eye ; my conversation with her flashed upon me, 
and in spite of all I could do I smiled. She took it for the 
signal, and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched 
off the whole audience ; and the explosion that followed was 
the triumph of the evening. I thought that that honest man 
Sawyer would choke himself; and as for the bludgeons, they 
perfonned like pile-drivers. But my poor little morsel of 
pathos was ruined. It was taken in good faith as an intentional
joke, and the prize one of the entertainment, and I 
wisely let it go at that. 

All the papers were kind in the morning ; my appetite 
returned ; I had abundance of money. All's well that ends 
well. 



 CHAPTER LXXIX. 

I LAUNCHED out as a lecturer, now, with great boldness. 
I had the field all to myself, for public lectures were almost 
an unknown commodity in the Pacific market. They are not 
so rare, now, I suppose. I took an old personal friend along 
to play agent for me, and for two or three weeks we roamed 
through Nevada and California and had a very cheerful time 
of it. Two days before I lectured in Virginia City, two stage- 
coaches were robbed within two miles of the town. The dar- 
ing act was committed just at dawn, by six masked men, who 
sprang up alongside the coaches, presented revolvers at the 
heads of the drivers and passengers, and commanded a general 
dismount. Everybody climbed down, and the robbers took 
their watches and every cent they had. Then they took gun- 
powder and blew up the express specie boxes and got their 
contents. The leader of the robbers was a small, quick-spoken 
man, and the fame of his vigorous manner and his intrepidity 
was in everybody's moutli when we arrived. 

The night after instructing Virginia, I walked over the 
desolate "divide" and down to Gold Hill, and lectured there. 
The lecture done, I stopped to talk with a friend, and did not 
start back till eleven. The " divide "- was high, unoccupied 
ground, between the towns, the scene of twenty midnight 
murders and a hundred robberies. As we climbed up and 
stepped out on this eminence, the Gold Hill lights dropped 
out of sight at our backs, and the night closed down gloomy 

audi dismal. A sharp wind swept the place, too, and chilled 
onr perspiring bodies through. 

" I tell you I don't like this place at night," said Mike the 
agent. 

" Well, don't speak so loud," I said. " You needn't remind 
anybody that we are here." 

Just then a dim figure approached me from the direction of 
Virginia — a man, evidently. He came straight at me, and I 
stepped aside to let him pass ; he stepped in the way and con- 
fronted me again. Then I saw that he had a mask on and 
was holding something in my face — I heard a click-click and 
recognized a revolver in dim outline. I pushed the barrel 
aside with my hand and said : 

" Don't ! " 
' He ejaculated sharply : 

" Your watch ! Your money ! " 

I said : 

" You can have them with pleasure — but take the pistol 
away from my face, please. It makes me shiver." 

" No remarks ! Hand out your money ! " 

'' Certainly— I—" 

" Put up your hands ! Don't you go for a weapon ! Put 
'em up ! Higher ! " 

I held them above my head. 

A pause. Then : 

" Are you going to hand out your money or not ?" 

I dropped my hands to my pockets and said : 

Certainly ! I—" 

" Put up your hands ! Do you want your heg,d blown off? 
Higher !" 

I put them above my head again. 

Another pause. 

A7'e you going to hand out your money or not f Ah-ah — • 
again ? Put up your hands ! By George, you want the head 
shot off you awful bad ! " 

" Well, friend, I'm trying my best to please you. You tell 

me to give up my money, and when I reach for it you tell me 
to put up my hands. If you would only — . Oh, now — don't ! 
All six of you at me ! That other man will get away while. — 
Now please take some of those revolvers out of my face — do 
if you please ! Every time one of them clicks, my liver comes 
up into my throat ! If you have a mother — any of you — or if 
any of you have ever had a mother — or a — grandmother — or 
a—" 

" Cheese it ! Will you give up your money, or have we 
got to — . There-there — none of that ! Put up our hands! " 

" Gentlemen — I know you are gentlemen by your — " 

" Silence ! If you want to be facetious, young man, there 
are times and places more fitting. This is a serious business." 

" You prick the marrow of my opinion. The funerals I 
have attended in my time were comedies compared to it. 
Now I  think—" 

" Curse your palaver ! Your money ! — your money ! — 
your money ! Hold ! — put up your hands ! " 

" Gentlemen, listen to reason. You see how I am situated 
• — now donH put those pistols so close — I smell the powder. 
You see how I am situated. If I had four hands — so that I 
could hold up two and — " 

" Throttle him ! Gag him ! Kill him !" 

" Gentlemen, donH ! Nobody'" watching the other fellow. 
Why don't some of you — . Ouch ! Take it away, please ! 
Gentlemen, you see that I've got to hold up my hands ; and 
so I can't take out my money — but if you'll be so kind as to 
take it out for me, I will do as much for you some — " 

" Search him Beauregard — and stop his jaw with a bullet, 
quick, if he wags it again. Help Beauregard, Stonewall." 

Then tlirce of them, with the small, spry leader, adjourned 
to Mike and fell to searching him. I was so excited that my 
lawless fancy tortured me to ask my two men all manner of 
facetious questions about their rebel brother-generals of the 
South, but, considering the order they had received, it was 
but common prudence to keep still. When everything had 
been taken from me, — watch, money, and a multitude of trifles 
of small value, — I supposed I was free, and forthwith put my 
cold hands into my empty pockets and began an inoffensive 


jig to warm my feet and stir up some latent courage — but in- 
stantly all pistols were at my head, and the order came again : 

" Be still ! Put up your hands ! And lieeiJ them up ! '* 

They stood Mike up alongside of me, with strict orders to 
keep his hands above his head, too, and then the chief high- 
wayman said : 

" Beauregard, hide behind that boulder ; Phil Sheridan, 
you hide behind that other one ; Stonewall Jackson, put your- 
self behind that sage-bush there. Keep your pistols bearing 
on these fellows, and if they take down their hands within ten 
minutes, or move a single peg, let them have it ! " 

Then three disappeared in the gloom toward the several 
ambushes, and the other three disappeared down the road to- 
ward Virginia. 

It was depressingly still, and miserably cold. Now this 
whole thing was a practical joke, and the robbers were per- 
sonal friends of ours in disguise, and twenty more lay hidden 

within ten feet of ns during the whole operation, listening. 
Mike knew all this, and was in the joke, but I suspected noth- 
ing of it. To me it was most uncomfortably genuine. 

When we had stood there in the middle of the road five
