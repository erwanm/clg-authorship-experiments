  

He was valldiig over toward the West side, aim- 
lessly at first, and then at times with the longing to 
do something to save those mistaken men from 
themselves forming itself into a purpose. "Was not 
that what she meant, when she bewailed her woman's 
helplessness ? She must have wished him to try, 
if he, being a man, could not do something ; or if 
she did not, still he would try, and if she heard of 
it, she would recall what she had said, and would 
be glad he had understood her so. Thinking of 
her pleasure in what he was going to do, he forgot 
almost what it was ; but when he came to a street- 
car track he remembered it, and looked up and 
down to see if there were any turbulent gathering 
of men, whom he might mingle with and help to 
keep from violence. He saw none anywhere ; and 
then suddenly, as if at the same moment, for in his 
exalted mood all events had a dreamdikc simul- 
taneity, he stood at the corner of an avenue, and in 
the middle of it, a little way off, was a street-car, 
and around the car a tumult of shouting, cursing, 
struggling men. The driver was lashing his horses 
forward, and a policeman was at their heads, with 
the conductor, pulling them ; stones, clubs, brick- 
bats hailed upon the car, the horses, the men 
trying to move them. The mob closed upon 
them in a body, and then a patrol-wagon whirled 
up from the other side, and a squad of policemen 
leaped out, and began to club the rioters. Conrad 
could see how they struck them under the rims of 
their hats ; the blows on their skulls sounded as if 



  

they had fallen on stone ; the rioters ran in all 
directions. 

One of the officers rushed up toward the corner 
"vvhere Conrad stood, and then he saw at his side a 
tall old man with a long white beard. He was call- 
ing out at the policeman : " Ah yes ! Glup the 
strikerss — gif it to them ! Why don't you co and 
glup the bresidents that insoalt your lawss, and gick 
your Boart of Arpidration out-of-toors ? Glup the 
strikerss — they cot no friendts ! They cot no money 
to pribe you, to dreat you ! " 

The officer lifted his club, and the old man threw 
his left arm up to shield his head. Conrad recog- 
nised Lindau, and now he saw the empty sleeve 
dangle in the air, over the stump of his wrist. He 
heard a shot in that turmoil beside the car, and 
something seemed to strike him in the breast. He 
was going to say to the policeman, " Don't strike 
him ! He's an old soldier ! You see he has no 
hand !" but he could not speak, he could not move 
his tongue. The policeman stood there ; he saw his 
face : it was not bad, not cruel ; it was like the face 
of a statue, fixed, perdurable ; a mere image of irre- 
sponsible and involuntary authority. Then Conrad 
fell forward, pierced through the heart by that shot 
fired from the car. 

March heard the shot as he scrambled out of his 
car, and at the same moment he saw Lindau drop 
under the club of the policeman, who left him where 
he fell, and joined the rest of the squad in pursuing 
the rioters. The fisrhting round the car in the 



  

avenue ceased ; the driver whipped his horses into a 
gallop, and the place was left empty. 

March would have liked to run ; he thought how 
his wife had implored him to keep away from the 
rioting; but he could not have left Lindau lying 
there if he would. Something stronger than his 
will drew him to the spot, and there he saw Conrad 
dead beside the old man. 



VL 



In the cares which Mrs, March shared with her 
husband that night she was supported partly by 
principle, but mainly by the potent excitement 
which bewildered Conrad's family and took all 
reality from what had happened. It was nearly 
midnight when the Marches left them and walked 
away toward the elevated station with Fulkerson. 
Everything had been done, by tliat time, that could 
be done ; and Fulkerson was not without that satis- 
faction in the business-like despatch of all the details 
which attends each step in such an affair, and helps 
to make death tolerable even to the most sorely 
stricken. We are creatures of the moment ; we 
live from one little space to another ; and only one 
interest at a time fills these. Fulkerson was cheerful 
when they got into the street, almost gay ; and Mrs. 
March experienced a rebound from her depression 
which she felt that she ought not to have experienced. 
But she condoned the offence a little in herself, because 
her husband remained so constant in his gravity ; and 
pending the final accounting he must make her for 
having been where he could be of so much use from 
the first instant of the calamity, she was tenderly, 



  

gratefully proud of all the use he had been to Conrad's 
family, and especially his miserable old father. To 
her mind March was the principal actor in the whole 
affair, and much more important in having seen it 
than those who had suffered in it. In fact, he had 
suffered incomparably. 

'•'Well, well," said Fulkerson. "They'll get 
along now. We 've done all tee could, and there 's 
nothing left but for them to bear it. Of course it 's 
awful, but I guess it 'll come out all right. I mean," 
he added, " they 'll pull through now." 

"I suppose," said March, "that nothing is put 
on us that we can't bear. But I should think," 
he went on musingly, "that when God sees what 
we poor finite creatures can bear, hemmed round 
with this eternal darkness of death, He must respect 
ns." 

" Basil ! " said his wife. But in her heart she 
drew nearer to him for the words she thought she 
ought to rebuke him for. 

" Oh, I know," he said, " we school ourselves to 
despise human nature. But God did not make us 
despicable, and I say whatever end He meant us 
for. He must have some such thrill of joy in our 
adequacy to fate as a father feels when his son 
shows himself a man. When I think what we can 
be if we must, I can't believe the least of us shall 
finally perish." 

"Oh, I reckon the Almighty won't scoop any of 
us," said Fulkerson, with a piety of his own. 

" That poor boy's father ! " sighed Mrs. Man'n. 



  

" I can't get his face out of my sight. He looked so 
much worse than death." 

" Oh, death doesn't look bad," said March. " It 's 
life that looks so in its presence. Death is peace 
and pardon. I only wish poor old Lindau was as 
well out of it as Conrad there." 

"Ah, Lindau ! He has done harm enough," said 
Mrs. March. " I hope he will be careful after this." 

March did not try to defend Lindau against her 
 the ory of the case, which inexorably held him re- 
sponsible for Conrad's death. 

" Lindau 's going to come out all right, I guess," 
said Fulkerson. " He was first-rate when I saw him 
at the hospital to-night." He whispered in March's 
env, at a chance he got in mounting the station 
stairs : " I didn't like to tell you there at the house, 
but I guess you 'd better know. They had to take 
Lindau's arm off near the shoulder. Smashed all to 
pieces by the clubbing." 

In the house, vainly rich and foolishly unfit for 
them, the bereaved family whom the Marches had 
just left lingered together, and tried to get strength 
to part for the night. They were all spent with the 
fatigue that comes from heaven to such misery as 
theirs, and they sat in a torpor in which each waited 
for the other to move, to speak. 

Christine moved, and Mela spoke. Christine rose 
and went out of the room without saying a word, 
and they heard her going upstairs. Then Mela said, 

" I reckon the rest of us better be goun' too, father. 
Here, let 's git mother started." 




She put her arm round licr mother, to lift her 
from her chair, but the old mau did not stir, and 
Mela called Mrs. Mandel from the next room. Be- 
tween them they raised her to her feet. 

"Ain't there anybody a-goin' to set up with it V 
she asked, in her hoarse pipe. " It appears like folks 
hain't got any fcelin's in New York. "Woon't some 
o' the neighbours come and offer to set up, without 
waitin' to be asked V 

" Oh, that 's all right, mother. The men 'll attend 
to that. Don't you bother any," Mela coaxed, and 
she kept her arm round her mother, with tender 
patience. 

" Why, Mely, child ! I can't feel right to have it 
left to hirelin's, so. But there ain't anybody any 
more to see things done as they ought. If Coonrod 
was on'y here " 

"Well, mother, you are pretty mixed!" said 
Mela, with a strong tendency to break into her large 
guffaw. But she checked herself and said, "I know 
just how you feel, though. It keeps a-comun' and 
a-goun' ; and it 's so and it ain't so, all at once ; 
that's the plagiie of it. Well, father! Ain't you 
goun' to come ? ' 

" I 'm goin' to stay, Mela," said the old man gently, 
without moving. "Get your mother to bed, that's 
a good girk" 

"You goin' to set up with him, Jacob ? " asked the 
old woman. 

" Yes, 'Liz'beth, I 'll set up. You go to bed." 

" well, I will, Jacob. And I believe it 'll do you 



  

good to set up. I wished I could set up with you ; 
but I don't seem to have the stren'th I did when the 

twins died. I must git my sleep, so 's to I don't 

like very well to have you broke of your rest, Jacob, 
but there don't appear to be anybody else. You 
wouldn't have to do it if Coonrod was here. There 
I go ag'in ! Mercy ! mercy ! " 

"Well, do come along, then, mother, ' said Mela; 
and she got her out of the room, with Mrs. Mandel's 
help, and up the stairs. 

From the top the old woman called down : " You 

tell Coonrod " She stopped, and he heard her 

groan out, "My Lord ! my Lord !" 

He sat, one silence in the dining-room, where they 
had all lingered together, and in the lil>rary beyond 
the hireling watcher sat, another silence. The time 
passed, but neither moved, and the last noise in the 
house ceased, so that they heard each other breathe, 
and the vague, remote rumour of the city invaded the 
inner stillness. It grew louder toward morning, and 
then Dryfoos knew from the watcher's deeper 
breathing that he had fallen into a doze. 

He crept by him to the drawing-room, where his 
son was ; the place was full of the awful sweetness 
of the flowers that Fulkerson had brought, and that 
lay above the pulseless breast. The old man turned 
up a burner in the chandelier, and stood looking on 
the majestic serenity of the dead face. 

He could not move when he saw his wife coming 
down the stairway in the hall. She was in her long 
white flannel bedcrown, and the candle she carried 



  

shook with lior nervous tremor. Ho thought slic 
might be -walking in her sleep, but she said, quite 
simply, " I woke up, and I couldn't git to sleep ag'in 
without comin' to have a look." She stood beside 
their dead son with him. " "Well, he 's beautiful, 
Jacob. He was the prettiest baby ! And ho was 
always good, Coonrod was ; I 'll say that for him. 
I don't believe he ever give me a minute's care in 
his whole life. I reckon I liked him about the best 
of all the childern ; but I don't know as I ever done 
much to show it. But you was always good to him, 
Jacob ; you always done the best for him, ever since 
he was a little feller. I used to be afraid you 'd spoil 
him sometimes in them days ; but I guess you 're glad 
now for every time you didn't cross him. I don't 
suppose since the twins died you ever hit him a 
lick." She stooped and peered closer at the face. 
" Why, Jacob, what's that there by his pore eye ?" 
Dryfoos saw it too, the wound that he had feared 
to look for, and that now seemed to redden on his 
sight. He broke into a low, wavering cry, like a 
child's in despair, like an animal's in terror, like a 
soul's in the anguish of remorse. 



VII. 



The evening after the funeral, while the Marches 
sat together talking it over, and making approaches, 
through its shadow, to the question of their own 
future, which it involved, they were startled by the 
twitter of the electric bell at their apartment door. 
It was really not so late as the children's having 
gone to bed made it seem ; but at nine o'clock it was 
too late for any probable visitor except Fulkerson. 
It might be he, and March was glad to postpone the 
impending question to his curiosity concerning the 
immediate business Fulkerson might have with him. 
He went himself to the door, and confronted there 
a lady deeply veiled in black, and attended by a 
very decorous serving-woman. 

"Are you alone, Mr. March — you and Mrs. 
March ? " asked the lady, behind her veil ; and as he 
hesitated, she said, " You don't know me ! Miss 
Vance ; " and she threw back her veil, showing her 
face wan and agitated in the dark folds, "I am 
very anxious to see you — to speak with you both. 
May I come in ? " 

" Why, certainly. Miss Vance," he answered, still 
too much stupefied by her presence to realise it. 




  

She promptly entered, nnti sayincr, wiih a glance 
at the hall chair by the door, "My maid can sit 
here ? " followed him to the room whcre he had left 
his wife. 

Mrs. !March showed herself more capable of coping 
 with the fact. She welcomed Miss Vance with the 
liking they both felt for the girl, and with the 
sympathy which her troubled face inspired. 

"I won't tire you with excuses for coming, Mrs. 
March," she said, "for it was the only thing left for 
me to do ; and I come at my aunt's suggestion." 
She added this as if it would help to account for her 
more on the conventional plane, and she had the 
instinctive good taste to address herself throughout 
to INIrs. March as much as possible, though what she 
had to say was mainly for March. "I don't know 
how to begin-I don't know how to speak of this 
terrible affair. But you know what I mean. I feel 
as if I had lived a whole lifetime since it — happened. 
I don't want you to pity me for it," she said, fore- 
stalling a politeness from Mrs. March. "I'm the 
last one to be thought of, and you mustn't mind mo 
if I try to make you. I came to find out all of the 
truth that I can, and when I know just what that is 
I shall know what to do. I have read the inquest ; 
it's all burnt into my brain. But I don't care for 
that — for myself : you must let me say such things 
without minding me. I know that your husband — 
that Mr. March was there ; I read his testimony ; 

and I wished to ask him — to ask him " She 

stopped and looked distractedly about, " But what 



  

folly ! He must have said everything he knew — he 
had to." Her eyes wandered to him from his wife, 
on whom she had kept them with instinctive tact. 

"I said everything — yes," he replied. "But if 
you would like to know " 

"Perhaps I had better tell you something first. 
I had just parted with him — it couldn't have been 
more than half an hour — in front of Brentano's ; he 
must have gone straight to his death. We were 
talking, and I — I said, Why didn't some one go 
among the strikers and plead with them to be peace- 
able, and keep them from attacking the new men. 
I knew that he felt as I did about the strikers; 
that he M\as their friend. Did you see — do you 
know anything that makes you think he had been 
trying to do that ? " 

"I am sorry," March began, "I didn't sec him at 
all till — till I saw him lying dead." 

"My husband was there purely by accident," 
Mrs. March put in. " I had begged and entreated 
him not to go near the striking anywhere. And he 
had just got out of the car, and saw the policeman 
strike that wretched Lindau — he's been such an 
anxiety to me ever since we have had anything to 
do with him here ; my husband knew him when he 
was a boy in the West. Mr. March came home 
from it all perfectly prostrated ; it made us all sick ! 
Nothing so horrible ever came into our lives before. 
I assure you it was the most shocking experience." 

Miss Vance listened to her with that look of 
patience which those who have seen much of the 




real suffering of the world — tlic daily portion of the 
poor — have for the nervous woes of comfortable 
people. March hung his head ; he knew it would 
be useless to protest that his share of the calamity 
 was, by comparison, infinitesimally small. 

After she had heard Mrs. March to the end even 
of her repetitions, Miss Vance said, as if it were a 
mere matter of course that she should have looked 
the affair up, " Yes, I have seen Mr. Lindau at the 
hospital " 

"My husband goes every day to see him," Mrs, 
March interrupted, to give a final touch to the con- 
ception of March's magnanimity throughout. 

"The poor man seems to have been in the wrong 
at the time," said Miss Vance. 

"I could almost say he had earned the right to 
be wrong. He 's a man of the most generous in- 
stincts, and a high ideal of justice, of equity — too 
high to be considered by a policeman with a club 
in his hand," said March, with a bold defiance of his 
wife's different opinion of Lindau. "It's the police- 
man's business, I suppose, to club the ideal when he 
finds it inciting a riot." 

"Oh, I don't blame Mr. Lindau; I don't blame 
the policeman ; he was as much a mere instrument 
as his club was. I am only trying to find out how 
much I am to blame myself. I had no thought of 
Mr. Dryfoos's going there — of his attempting to talk 
with the strikers and keep them quiet ; I was only 
thinking, as women do, of what I should try to do 
if I were a man. But perhaps he understood me to 



  

ask him to go — perhaps my words sent him to his 
death." 

She had a sort of calm in her courage to know 
the worst truth as to her responsibility that forbade 
any wish to flatter her out of it. "I'm afraid," 
said March, "that is what can never be known 
now." After a moment he added, '* But why should 
you wish to know ? If he went there as a peace- 
maker, he died in a good cause, in such a way as he 
would wish to die, I believe." 

" Yes," said the girl ; "I have thought of that. 
But death is awful ; we must not think patiently, 
forgivingly of sending any one to their death in the 
best cause." 

"I fancy life was an awful thing to Conrad 
Dryfoos," March replied. "He was thwarted and 
disappointed, without even pleasing the ambition 
that thwarted antl disappointed him. That poor old 
man, his father, warped him from his simple, life-
