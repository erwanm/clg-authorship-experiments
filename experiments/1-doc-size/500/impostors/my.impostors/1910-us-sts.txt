*' I know some one in the town who'll help you," 
he said. "You can't stay here — you'll catch 
cold." 

" What's there left for me? " she moaned. 
" What am I good for? He's thrown me over — 
and I can't hve without him! " 

Samuel got the imibrella up and held it with 
one hand ; then with his other arm about the girl's 
waist, he half carried her down the piazza steps. 
" That she-devil was after him! " she was saying. 
" And it was Jack Holliday set her at it, damn 
his soul! I'll pay him for it! " 

She poured forth a stream of wild invective. 





"Please stop," pleaded Samuel. "People will 
hear you." 

" What do I care if they do hear me ? Let them 
put me in jail — that's all I'm fit for. I'm drunk, 
and I'm good for nothing — and he's tired of 
me!" 

So she rushed on, all the way toward town. 
Then, as they came to the bridge, she stopped and 
looked about. " Where are you taking me? " she 
asked. 

" To a friend's house," he said, having in mind 
the Stedmans. 

" No," she replied. " I don't want to see any- 
one. Take me to some hotel, can't you? " 

" There's one down the street here," he said. 
" I don't know anything about it." 

" I don't care. Any place." 

The rain had slackened and she stopped and 
gathered up her wet and straggled hair. 

There was a bar underneath the hotel, and a 
flight of stairs led up to the office. They went 
up, and a man sitting behind the desk stared at 
them. 

" I want to get a room for this lady," said 
Samuel. " She's been caught in the rain." 

" Is she your wife? " asked the man. 

" Mercy, no," said he startled, 

" Do you want a room, too? " 

" No, no, I'm going away.'* 





"Oh!" said the man, and took down a key. 
" Register, please." 

Samuel took the pen, and then turned to the 
girl. " I beg pardon," he said, " but I don't 
know your name." 

" Mary Smith," she answered, and Samuel 
stared at her in surprise. " Mary Smith," she re- 
peated, and he wrote it down obediently. 

The man took them upstairs; and Samuel, 
after helping the girl to a chair, shut the door 
and stood waiting. And she flung herself down 
upon the bed and burst into a paroxysm of weep- 
ing. Samuel had never even heard the word hys- 
terics, and it was terrifying to him to see her — 
he could not have believed that so frail and 
slender a hviman body coxild survive so frightful 
a storm of emotion. 

" Oh, please, please stopl " he cried wildly. 

" I can't hve without him! " she wailed again 
and again. "I. can't live without him! What 
am I going to do? " 

Samuel's heart was wrung. He went to the 
girl, and put his hand upon her arm. " Listen 
to me," he said earnestly. " Let me try to help 

you." 

" What can you do? " she demanded. 

" I'll go and see him. I'll plead with him — 
perhaps he'll listen to me." 

"All right!" she cried. "Anything! Tell 





him I'll kill myself ! I'll kill him and Dolly both, 
before I'll ever let her have him! Yes, I mean it! 
He swore to me he'd never leave me! And I 
believed him — I trusted him! " 

And Samuel clenched his hands with sudden 
resolution. " I'll see him about it," he said. " I'll 
see him to-night." 

And leaving the other still shaking with sobs, 
he turned and left the room. 

He stopped in the office to tell the man that 
he was going. But there was nobody there; and 
after hesitating a moment he went on. 

The storm was over and the moon was out, with 
scud of clouds flying past. Samuel strode back 
to " Fairview," with his hands gripped tightly, 
and a blaze of resolution in his soul. 

He was just in time to see the automobile at 
the door, and the company taking their departure. 
They passed him, singing hilariously; and then 
he found himself confronting his young master. 

" Who's that? " exclaimed Bertie, startled. 

" It's me, sir," said Samuel. 

" Oh! Samuel! What are you doing here? " 

" I've been with the young lady, sir." 

" Oh! So that's what became of her! " 

" I took her to a hotel, sir." 

" Humph! " said Bertie. " I'm obHged to you." 

The piazza lights were turned up, and by them 
Samuel could see the other's face, flushed with 





drink, and his hair and clothing in disarray. He 
swayed shghtly as he stood there. 

" Master Albert," said Samuel very gravely, 
" May I have a few words with you? " 

" Sure," said Bertie. He looked about him 
for a chair and sank into it. " What is it? " he 
asked. 

" It's the yoimg lady. Master Albert." 

" What about her? " 

" She's very much distressed, sir." 

" I dare say. She'll get over it, Samuel." 

" Master Albert," exclaimed the boy, " you've 
not treated her fairly." 

The other stared at him. " The devil! " he ex- 
claimed. 

" You must not desert her, sir ! It would be a 
terrible thing to have on your conscience. You 
have ruined and betrayed her." 

" What! " cried the other, and gazed at him 
in amazement. " Did she give you that kind of 
a jolly?" 

" She didn't go into particulars " — said the 
boy. 

" My dear fellow! " laughed Bertie. " Why, 
I've been the making of that girl. She was an 
eighteen-dollar-a-week chorus girl when I took 
her up." 

" That might be. Master Albert. But if she 
was an honest girl " 





"Nonsense, Samuel — forget it. She'd had 
three or four lovers before she ever laid eyes on 
me. 

There was a pause, while the boy strove to get 
these facts into his mind. " Even so," he said, 
" you can't desert her and let her starve, Master 
Albert." 

" Oh, stuif ! " said the other. " What put that 
into your head? I'll give her all the money she 
needs, if that's what's troubling her. Did she say 
that? " 

"N — no," admitted Samuel disconcerted. 
" But, Master Albert, she loves you." 

" Yes, I know," said Bertie, " and that's where 
the trouble comes in. She wants to keep me in a 
glass case, and I've got tired of it." 

He paused for a moment; and then a sudden 
idea flashed over him. " Samuel! " he exclaimed. 
*' Why don't you marry her? " 

Samuel started in amazement. "What!" he 
'gasped. 

" It's the very thing! " cried Bertie. " I'll set 
you up in a Httle business, and you can have an 
easy time." 

" Master Albert! " panted the boy shocked to 
the depths of his soul. 

" She's beautiful, Samuel — you know she is. 
And she's a fine girl, too — only a little wild. I 
believe you'd be just the man to hold her in." 





Bertie paused a moment, and then, seeing that 
the other was miconvineed, he added with a laugh, 
" Wait till you've known her a bit. Maybe you'll 
fall in love with her." 

But Samuel only shook his head. "Master Al- 
bert," he said, in a low voice, " I'm afraid you've 
not understood the reason I've come to you." 

" How do you mean? " 

" This — all this business, sir — it's shocked me 
more than I can tell you. I came here to serve 
you, sir. You don't know how I felt about it. 
I was ready to do anything — I was so grateful 
for a chance to be near you! You were rich and 
great, and everything about you was so beautiful 
— I thought you must be noble and good, to have 
deserved so much. And now, instead, I find you 
are a wicked man! " 

The other sat up. "The dickens!" he ex- 
claimed. 

" And it's a terrible thing to me," went on 
Samuel. " I don't know just what to make of 
it " 

"See here, Samuel!" demanded the other 
angrily. " Who sent you here to lecture me? " 

" I don't see how it can be ! " the boy exclaimed. 
" You are one of the fit people, as Professor 
Stewart explained it to me ; and yet I know some 
who are better than you, and who have nothing 
at all." 





And Bertie Lockman, after another stare 
into the boy's solemn eyes, sank back in his chair 
and burst into laughter. " Look here, Sam- 
uel!" he exclaimed. "You aren't playing the 
game ! " 

" How do you mean, sir? " 

" If I'm one of the fit ones, what right have 
you got to preach at me? " 

Samuel was startled. " Why, sir — " he stam- 
mered. 

" Just look! " went on Bertie. " I'm the mas- 
ter, and you're the servant. I have breeding and 
culture — everything — and you're just a country 
bumpkin. And yet you presume to set your 
ideas up against mine! You presume to judge 
me, and tell me what I ought to do! " 

Samuel was taken aback by this. He could 
not think what to reply. 

"Don't you see?" went on Bertie, following 
up his advantage. " If you really believe what 
you say, you ought to submit yourself to me. If 
I say a thing's right, that makes it right. If 
I had to come to you to have you approve it, 
wouldn't that make you the master and me the 
servant? " 

" No, no — Master Albert! " protested Samuel. 
" I didn't mean quite that! " 

"Why, I might just as well give you my 
money and be done with it," insisted the other. 





" Then you could fix everything up to suit your- 
self." 

"That isn't what I mean at all!" cried the 
boy in great distress. " I don't know how to an- 
swer you, sir — but there's a wrong in it." 

"But where? How?" 

" Master Albert," blurted Samuel—" it can't 
be right for you to get dnuikl " 

Bertie's face clouded. 

" It can't be right, sir! " repeated Samuel. 

And suddenly the other sat forward in his 
chair. "All right," he said — "Maybe it isn't. 
But what are you going to do about it? " 

There was anger in his voice, and Samuel was 
frightened into silence. There was a pause while 
they stared at each other. 

"I'm on top!" exclaimed Bertie. "I'm on 
top, and I'm going to stay on top — don't you 
see? The game's in my hands; and if I please to 
get drunk, I get drunk. And you will take your 
orders and mind your own business. And what 
have you to say to that? " 

" I presume, sir," said Samuel, his voice almost 
a whisper, " I can leave your service." 

" Yes," said the other — " and then either you'll 
starve, or else you'll go to somebody else who has 
money, and ask him to give you a job. And 
then you'll take your orders from him, and keep 
your opinions to yourself. Don't you see? " 





" Yes," said Samuel, lowering his eyes — " I 
see." 

" All right," said Bertie ; and he rose unstead- 
ily to his feet. " Now, if you please," said he, 
" you'll go hack to Belle, wherever you've left 
her, and take her a message for me." 

" Yes, sir," said Samuel. 

" Tell her I'm through with her, and I don't 
want to see her again. I'll have a couple of hun- 
dred dollars a month sent to her so long as she 
lets me alone. If she writes to me or bothers me 
in any way, she'll get nothing. And that's all." 

" Yes, sir," said Samuel. 

" And as for you, this was all right for a joke, 
hut it wouldn't bear repeating. From now on, 
you're the gardener's boy, and you'll not forget 
your place again." 

" Yes, sir," said Samuel once more, and stood 
watching while his young master went into the 
house. 

Then he turned and went down the road, half 
dazed. 

Those had been sledge-hammer blows, and 
they had landed full and hard. They had left 
him without a shred of all his illusions. His work, 
that he had been so proud of — he hated it, and 
everything associated with it. And he was over- 
whelmed with perplexity and pain — just as be- 
fore when he had foimd himself in jail, and it 





had dawned upon him that the Law, an institu- 
tion which he had revered, might be no sucK 
august thing at all, but an instrument of injus- 
tice and oppression. 

In that mood he came to the hotel. Again 
there was no one in the office, so he went directly 
to the room and knocked. There was no answer; 
he knocked again, more heavily. 

" I wonder if she's gone," he thought, and 
looked again at the number, to make sure he was 
at the right room. Then, timidly, he tried the 
door. 

It opened. " Lady," he said, and then louder, 
" Lady." 

There was no response, and he went in. Could 
she be asleep? he thought. No — that was not 
likely. He listened for her breathing. There 
was not a sound. 

And finally he went to the bed, and put his 
hand upon it. Then he started back with a cry 
of terror. He had touched something warm and 
moist and sticky. 

He rushed out into the hall, and as he looked 
at his hand he nearly fainted. It was a mass of 
blood ! 

"Helpl Help!" the boy screamed; and he 
turned and rushed down the stairs into the office. 

The proprietor came running in. "Look!" 
shouted Samuel. "Look what she's done!" 





" Good God ! " cried the man. And he rushed 
upstairs, the other following. 

With trembling fingers the man lit the gas; 
and Samuel took one look, and then turned away 
and caught at a table, sick with horror. The girl 
was lying in the midst of a pool of blood; and 
across her throat, from ear to ear, was a great 
gaping sht. 

"Oh! oh!" gasped Samuel, and then — "I 
can't stand it! " And holding out one hand from 
him, he hid his face with the other. 

Meantime the proprietor was staring at him, 
" See here, young fellow," he said. 

" What is it? " asked Samuel. 

" When did you find out about this? " 

*' Why, just now. When I came in." 

'" You've been out? " 

"Why of course. I went out just after we 
came." 

" I didn't see you." 

" No. I stopped in the office, but you weren't 
there." 

" Htmiph! " said the man, " maybe you did and 
maybe you didn't. You can tell it to the police." 

"The police!" echoed Samuel; and then in 
sudden horror — " Do you think I did it? " 

" I don't know anything about it," replied the
