to Cragness with me." 

Anah Hurst started up in utter astonishment. 

" Yes. There are broad acres of farm-land, mountain-wilds, 
a mill, a stone-quarry and gold for all I know," with a short 
laugh. "And why should I not do it? I have no kith noi 
kin beside." 



 

"But ," for though Anah Hurst had thought of possible 
generosity, nothing so entire had found its way to her soul, in 
its wildest imaginings. 

"It will be better for the lad, I think, and change into 
mountain air may benefit your husband. Trewartha will de 
cide when and how it will be possible to move him. Hush, 
not a word. I am impoverishing no one. Suppose, after having 
lived your life of penury after seeing your son drag through 
a miserable existence with poverty and discouragements, a for 
tune should come to him at the last. Better a little now, I say. 
I'm not going to make him rich, but to give him a fair start." 

Anah reached out her hand. 

"You are too good," she almost sobbed. 

" No, I'm not good at all. Dispossess your mind quickly of 
that idea. I'm a proud, self-willed, cranky old woman. But I 
should not have the grace to die without leaving you a few 
thousands, and for all I see I may as well use them now. " 

They talked until almost noon. Trewartha and Victor, in 
the adjoining room, made rapid strides into good-fellowship. 
It was Victor's first real experience with depth, strength, and 
culture, and he found it very fascinating. 

Meanwhile the storm had increased. Streets and lanes were 
white with the tempest of snow, still whirling little mounds to 
the sheltered side. Mrs. Hurst began to prepare her dinner. 
Victor was summoned and requested to do some simple 
marketing. She handed him the note received last night from 
Mrs. McRae. 

"No, I couldn't touch it;" with a young man's sensitive 
pride, the fine nostrils curling impatiently. 

"It is all I have. When they pay father " 

He thrust his fur cap over his eyes, pulled his coat-collar up 
round his chin, and stamped his way down the walk. Two 
pictures came vividly before his mental vision Alfred Lowndes, 
"our talented and painstaking young countryman on the high 
road to fame," as the papers had announced him at his depart- 



 

ure, sunning himself in that far land of beaut)' and art, and 
winning praise, making money with what ? a paltry gift of 
presenting nature in her washed-up drawing-room attire of 
small prettiness ; and Doctor Trewartha, a man of true culture, 
refinement, ease, rare humor and knowledge of all kinds, able 
to classify the lizards found in rocks centuries old, and tell you 
what gradations of color went to make an autumn leaf. Not 
that he envied Lowndes, only the luck that had placed him 
where he was ; nor Trewartha, any farther than the life and 
wealth that had given him such advantages. Fifteen years 
from this he could reach neither estate, not having the trick of 
popularity the one possessed, nor the ease and leisure of the 
other. Talk of a man working his way up was it an easy 
task when brain and soul and limbs were exhausted with 
severe physical labor ? 

He turned into the little shop. Sometimes they had an 
account standing here when the salary had been very much in 
arrears ; but now he must deliberately ask for credit. 

"Morning, Hurst. Bitterish kind of a storm. Been 
threatening a long while, though. How's your father ?" 

Then James Penly went on chopping the ragged edges off 
of a piece of meat, and throwing them on another block for 
sausage. 

"About the same." 

"What'll you have?" seeing that his customer was rather 
backward, and half-suspecting the truth. 

"Several articles, and if you will let them stand " stam 
mering, as he crushed down his pride. 

"Well " hesitatingly, "times are pretty hard ; business of 
all kinds being so dull. Awful work to collect money. Got 
a look for anything ?" 

" No ;" the fair face turning swarthy with mortification. "But 
the salary has not all been paid, or. I should not ask you to 
wait." He felt quite willing now to take it in hand. 

"Hasn't?" with a kind of contemptuous laugh. "You 



  

might about as well give that up, then. Rather <?lucky that 
you should have gone so deep into the strike, Hurst." 

Victor turned as if he would leave the place. 

" Don't be so huffy, young man. I've never been disoblig 
ing yet to an honest neighbor. Come, what'll you have?" with 
an air of alacrity. 

Victor swallowed his pride and the deeper wound, and made 
his few purchases. This was the real sting of poverty ; but he 
did not mean that Mrs. McRae should eat her dinner in their 
house, bought with her own money. 

Doctor Trewartha had been discussing Mr. Hurst's case with 
the two women. 

" He should have been taken out through the summer, and 
thus assisted in regaining the use of his limbs ; and the exer 
cise would have been beneficial to his brain as well. There 
can be hardly any hope of his ultimate recovery, but he may 
improve, as his constitution still seems strong. Change 
of scene, and an entirely different life, must be the first 
step. " 

Anah sighed. How easy it was to talk to prescribe. God 
had sent poverty and misfortune upon them, but they were not 
alone. She had seen so many poor, weary creatures stretched 
upon beds of helplessness, until from her sad, overflowing 
heart she had cried, ' ' How long, O Lord, how long ?" Was 
the world ruled with justice and wisdom ? 

"We thought of going away," she said, hesitatingly. "Vic 
tor had planned " 

"I may as well tell you, Trewartha, that / have not only 
planned, but have made known my wishes. When could 
Mr. Hurst endure the fatigue of a journey ?" 

" He could be moved as soon as the weather would permit," 
glancing from one to the other in the utmost surprise, and 
then smiling. He might have known that Janet McRae 
would lose no time. 

"But the young man " 



 

"Mrs. Hurst has trained her son but poorly if he refuses 
to see what is so evidently for his own advantage," in a quick 
tone, tapping her foot sharply upon the floor. 

Trewartha came round to her side and said, just under his 
breath " Be careful the fellow is as proud as Lucifer." 

"But you think him worth saving?" 

"I think him worth it ;" with an odd, far-light in the eyes, 
as if speculating upon some matter. 

" I'll be tender of his pride ;" laughing complacently. 

Trewartha would have gone about the business cautiously: 
questioned the young man's wants, and aims, and longings, 
and entrapped him upon some unwary admission he half 
suspected them now and then led him gently to the point. 
Straightforward women have more confidence in the force of 
simple truth, depending less upon logical sequences. 

So that afternoon she laid the matter before Victor, growing 
eloquent over the advantages his parents would derive from 
the change. 

"And as for you," she went on, in her caustic but sweet- 
humored way, that, after all, was her most fascinating gift, "I 
should think you had gone to the end of your tether here. 
You will find that a man's blunders are remembered against 
him more readily than his sins, in this world, where want of 
success is a crime. Come to Cragness, and see how you like 
it. You can find plenty of work there, if that is your fancy," 
studying him with her keen blue eyes. 

" Poverty and work go together naturally, I believe. It is 
an ancient partnership, never to be divorced ;" meeting her 
glance with an under-current of defiance that she liked. Weak 
people were her abomination. 

'John Hurst made a mistake when he gave you that birth 
right. He should have done better." 

A faint purple line showed about Victor's mouth. The 
world outside would never know what John Hurst had done 
for him, and he had chivalry enough not to hear him blamed. 



 

"He did what he thought right. I can't make it clear how 
much God demands, but he gave Him all. As for the years 
to come, I shall take care of him while he lives. I shall not 
go to the wall because the luck was against me." 

"Luck !" with a fiery, downward breath, like an impatient 
snort. "You struck your blow at the wrong time, that was 
all a blunder. You tried to fight capital when business was 
growing dull, and men had swarmed in from the country, 
more fools they ; and your workmen, living from hand to 
mouth, can hold out about so long employers know that, 
too. The week's wages, the Trade's fund, and credit at the 
corner grocery a matter of two months, may be less, and then 
submission." 

"I think we had the right of it," doggedly. "Just ? bare 
subsistence for the men with families, and that to be lowered 
when extra expenses were coming on." 

" Let them fight their own battles another time." 
" I couldn't. You do not understand. If I had refused to 
join the men I should have been marked on the other side. I 
was no great favorite with them any way." 

" You don't belong to them ;" tapping her foot hard to give 
her words force. 

"It is difficult to tell where some men do belong," with a 
bitter smile, thinking how everything had conspired to throw 
him into this groove. Even Lowndes had raised his hand. 

" You are young enough to try it over again. More than 
one person has missed the path in his hot unreasoning 
youth." 

He made no answer. She watched the power and beauty in 
his face, the sharp discordant lines that looked so inharmo 
nious. And though in her sturdy Scotch pride she would 
have flung out the Greek grace and sort of sculptured contour, 
as a woman it rather pleased her. It was not soft and vas- 
cillating. He could be sharp and ungracious when the mood 
took him. 



 

"So you will come to Cragness," she went on, as if the 
matter was settled. "It is not likely your father can live 
many years. I shall wish to keep your mother after that my 
self, and you can try your fortune. By that time you will 
know best what to do. " 

Victor Hurst's eyes wandered to the drooping figure of his 
mother. She was sitting beside her husband, Trewartha 
making a third, and explaining some curious case over which 
he had puzzled years agone. He noted the sharpened outlines, 
the thin fingers busy with the knitting, the slow-moving 
melancholy eyes, the pale grayish skin with no soft flush or 
elasticity about it. She, barely past the boundary-line of forty, 
and this hardy, brilliant, forcible woman, with breath fragrant 
as dewy violets, cheeks with the flush of youth, no sense of 
loss or incompleteness about her, no hint of privation in the 
firm, rosy flesh, and lacking only a few years of the allotted 
three score and ten. 

Would it not be cruel to deprive her of the only alleviation 
that might come in her life ? And then he had half promised 
her. 

If Mrs. McRae knew the secret that he and his mother held 
between them, would she still ask ? But were they bound 
to drag up the sins of another person and answer for 
them? 

"I will come to Cragness," he began, in a slow, deliberate 
tone, "if I can find work there. I could obtain it elsewhere, 
but the trouble is to leave them alone until I am able to make 
a new home. We are very poor." 

He did not flush but rather paled at this confession. And 
she, reading the stormy, pricking pride, the bitter humiliation, 
was minded to help him, and answered more softly 

' ' John Hurst might have been a prosperous man if he 
had thought more of himself and less of his neighbors. I don't 
know but he went beyond the commandment. We under 
stand the need of a heaven when we see such lives." 



 

Then she was not all satire and self-esteem. He seemed 
to draw nearer to her, silently. 

"You shall find the work. I have to depend upon my 
good friend Doctor Trewartha for many favors where it would 
be good to have help of one's own. Since Mr. McRae's 
death, sixteen years ago, I have carried on the place alone." 

"One's own !" A tint of the McRae blood ran in his veins 
to be sure, but as a curious suspicion flashed through his 
brain how could he well help he would be the last of the 
race. No, if she thought of such a thing it could never, 
never be. One way and another every family carried about 
with them some honors, pride, wealth, lineage, pure blood, 
and there had been a curse set upon him that would mock 
them all. 

" While my parents live I shall be their stay and support. 
I think I have some roving fancies in my brain, and if I 
were free to follow them " 

"Yes, I understand;" nodding her head. "While they 
live, then." 

He was surprised at her ready concession. 

She glanced at him from under her wide, drooping lids as 
a huntsman might at the wild shy falcon he allures to his 
finger. Once there 

"A woman's wit is as keen as a man's," she said to herself. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

A MILD February sun lay warm over the landscape, making 
the snow seem like fields of amber. On the high back-ground 
to the west the trees were distinctly outlined against a sky that 
wavered in azure lights. Lower and lower, range after range, 
until you came to the broad sweep of table-land broken by 
clumps of timber left uncut, or here and there a nest of houses 
in the ambitious fellowship of a straggling village. 

From her post by the large embayed window, Sylvia Red 
mond studied the picture. This old stone mansion stood on a 
rise of ground with a grove of giant oaks between it and the 
northern blasts. Over to the west were the chain of mountains, 
far to the south the towns, so far, indeed, that the smoke and 
din never penetrated this clear, clean air. Janet McRae would 
have it so. 

"If the railroad came up five miles higher, it would be 
worth a fortune to you," Dr. Trewartha had said. 

"What do I want of a fortune?" in her sharp, ringing tone. 
"It is near enough." 

"It would make the farm-produce so much more avail 
able." 

"The farms are well enough." 

The towns and villages had felt the effects ; but Cragness stood 
as it did fifty years ago, not even caring to hold out its hand 
to advancing civilization. 

To the eastward there were three or four mansions belonging 
to the gentry, stretched far apart, with their wide, surrounding 
acres. A rather lonely place most people would have thought, 
but Sylvia liked it. She never wearied standing by this window, 

 



 

noting all the fine detail of the still-life picture. She had seen 
the old blackened tree down yonder scathed by lightning, the 
great group of pines so black and uncanny in winter, the in 
dentation of the river winding round, at this season frozen over, 
but every curve in it was fresh to her memory. Not a hillock 
but she could have placed rightly, had she been thousands of 
miles away, sketching the scene. 

"Ruth," she exclaimed, suddenly turning to her com 
panion, "are there no old legends connected with this 
house ?" 

"Old legends? Not that I know of." 

The quiet, unsmiling face never moved, the white fingers 
went on with their work, a piece of heavy silk-embroidery for 
a chair. 

"You would have heard them?" 

"I suppose so." 

"That is why I like Rothermel. There are such hosts of 
pictures, and odd, quaint stories about them. Knights and 
ladies, and strange, weird faces full of daring and passion. I 
like it better even than my uncle's in Virginia, though the old 
negro women there tell me stories of love and murder and 
witchcraft. " 

"With but little truth in them." 

"What does it matter, after all? I like the glamor of 
romance. I always look over the old Gilliat chronicles for the 
war scenes, and then take a peep at the picture of royalist Sir 
Hugh in his scarlet-slashed doublet. That is true, at least ;" 
with a silvery little laugh. ' ' You are so matter of fact, Ruth. " 

" Yes ; that was too sadly true. The only legend of the 
McRaes, if you can call it one, is the fact that some of its 
men fought with Cromwell." 

"I hate the Roundheads! Think how they must have 
looked, with their cropped hair and straight coats, singing 
psalms with a whine through their nose." 

"They were good men, " sturdily ; "and when they could 



 

no longer live according to the light of their consciences, they 
crossed the sea." 

"And burned those who would not agree with them. An 
odd species of toleration. I think your ancestors suffered a 
little there. I should hate them if I were you." 

Was it her Quaker blood, half a century back, that made 
Ruth Gamier so impassible ? 

"Why should I hate them ? They are all dead and gone, 
and lived according to their light. It is for God to judge the 
rest. " 

Sylvia looked at her curiously. Sometimes during the past 
fortnight she had thought her very handsome. A tall, grand 
woman, with a white, opaque skin rarely flushing, steady dark- 
brown eyes, and a heavy crown of dark hair always in the same 
massive braids. Her dress was grave but rich, and fell about 
her in great waves, as she sat in the crimson chair. That, and 
the silks in the embroidery, gave her a peculiar brilliance, as 
the shining green leaves set off a waxen camelia. If she would 
only flush, or frown, or get into little heats, like other girls 
for after all, there was only two years' difference in their ages. 
But Ruth Gamier might have been twenty-nine instead of 
nineteen. 

"So, they were Roundheads?" going back to the former 
subject. "Mrs. McRae should be a staunch old Scotch Pres 
byterian, then ?" 

"I think the sharpness of creeds gets worn off," replied 
Ruth Gamier, in her slow, reflective manner. 

"And laughed off, wherever Doctor Trewartha is," responded 
Sylvia, with a quick, gay smile that seemed a part of her em 
phatic little face. "Ruth, I am half in love with Doctor 
Trewartha." 

Then the grave eyes were raised slowly to the girl standing 
by the window. The piquant little figure, flashing hair, dewy 
clear eyes, and rosebud mouth, were very sweet and winsome. 
Ruth had liked her as one likes a kitten or a spoiled yet 



 

charming child. To hear her talk of love and Doctor Tre- 
wartha in the same breath ! 

"He is old enough to be your father;" in a tone of slow 
surprise. Everything about this girl was so deliberate, phleg 
matic. Perhaps it was a part of her temperament. 

"Well !" in her gay, sunny, child's tone. "What does the 
old adage say 'An old man's darling a young man's slave.' 
I do not believe that I have any taste for slavery." 

Then Ruth glanced out over the fast-wasting snow. On the 
ridges the ground began to show through. The amber tints 
were paling as the sun went westward, resolving themselves to 
grayish white in shadowy places. 

" When will they return ?" 

"I don't know. We ought to have a letter to-day. Mrs.
