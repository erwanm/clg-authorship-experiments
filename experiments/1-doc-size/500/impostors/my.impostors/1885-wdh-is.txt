thing but thinking themselves better. Their native 
modesty prevents that." 

'' I don't exactly know what you mean," said Miss 
Graham, after a little hesitation. 

"Well," returned Colville, "I haven't thought it 
out very clearly myself yet. I may mean that the 



 

Americans differ from other people in not thinking 
well of themselves, or they may differ from them in 
not tliinking well enough. But what I said had a 
very epigrammatic sound, and I prefer not to investi- 
gate it too closely." 

This made Miss Graham and Miss Effie both cry 
out " Oh !" in delighted doubt of his intention. They 
both insensibly drifted a little nearer to him. 

" There was a French lady said to me at the table- 
d'hSte this evening that she knew I was an American, 
because the Americans always strike the key of per- 
sonality." He practised these economies of material 
in conversation quite recklessly, and often made the 
same incident or suggestion do duty round a whole 
company. 

" Ah, I don't believe that," said Miss Graham. 

"Believe what?" 

" That jfche Americans always talk about them- 
selves." 

" I 'm not sure she meant that. You never can 
tell what a person means by what he says — or she." 

" How shocking !" 

" Perhaps the French lady meant that we always 
talk about other people. That 's in the key of per- 
sonality too." 

"But I don't believe we do," said Miss Graham. 
" At any rate, she was talking about us, then." 

" Oh, she accounted for that by saying there was 
a large American colony in Paris, who had corrupted 
the French, and taught them our pernicious habit of 
introspection.'' 



" Do you think we 're very introspective. " 

"Do your' 

" I know I 'm not. I hardly ever think about 
myself at all. At any rate, not till- it 's too late. 
That 's the great trouble. I wish I could. But I 'm 
always studying other people. They're so much 
more interesting.'' 

" Perhaps if you knew yourself better you wouldn't 
think so," suggested Colville. 

" Yes, I know they are. I don't think any young 
person can be interesting.'' 

" Then what becomes of all the novels ? They 're 
full of young persons." 

" They 're ridiculous. If I were going to write a 
novel, I should take an old person for a hero — thirty- 
five or forty. She looked at Colville, and blushing 
a little, hastened to add, " I don't believe that they 
begin to be interesting much before that time. Such 
flat things as young men are always saying ! Don't 
you remember that passage somewhere in Heine's 
Pictures of Travel, where he sees the hand of a lady 
coming out from under her mantle, when she 's con- 
fessing in a church, and he knows that it 's the hand 
of a young person who has enjoyed nothing and suf- 
fered nothing, it 's so smooth and flower-like ? After 
I read that I hated the look of my hands — I was 
only sixteen, and it seemed as if I had had no more 
experience than a child. Oh, I like people to bo 
through something. Don't you i" 

"WeliPyes, 'll suppose I do. Other people." 

"No ; but don't you like it for yourself V 



 

"I can't tell; I haven't been through anything v 
worth speaking of yet." 

Miss Graham looked at him dubiously, but 
pursued with ardour : " Why, just getting back to 
Florence, after not having been here for so long — 
I should think it would be so romantic. Oh dear ! 
I wish I were here for the second time." 

" I 'm afraid you wouldn't like it so well," said ' 
Colville. "I wish I were here for the first time. 
There 's nothing like the first time in everything." 

" Do you really think so 'll" 

" Well, there 's nothing like the first time in 
Florence." 

" Oh, I can't imagine it. I should think that re- 
calling the old emotions would be perfectly fascinat- 
mg. 

"Yes, if they'd come when you do call them. 
But they 're as contrary-minded as spirits from the 
vasty deep. I 've been shouting around here for my 
old emotions all day, and I haven't had a responsive 
squeak." 

" Oh !" cried Miss Graham, staring full-eyed at 
him. "How delightful!" Effie Bowen turned 
away her pretty little head and laughed, as if it 
might not be quite kind to laugh at a person's joke 
to his face. 

Stimulated by their appreciation, Colville went on 
with more nonsense. " No ; the only way to get at 
your old emotions in regard to Jj'lorenc e is to borrow 
them from somebody who 's having the m fresh. 
What do you think about Florence, Miss Graham ?" 



 

" I Ve been here two months." 

"Then it's too late?" 

" No, I don't know that it is. I keep feeling the 
strangeness all the time. But I can't tell you. It 's 
very different from Buffalo, I can assure you." 

" Buffalo ? I can imagine the difference. And 
it 's not altogether to the disadvantage of Buffalo." 

" Oh, have you been there ?" asked Miss Graham, 
with a touching little eagerness. " Do you know 
anybody in Buffalo ?" 

" Some of the newsjjaper men ; and I pass through 
there once a year on my way to New York— or used 
to. It 's a lively place." 

" Yes, it is," sighed Miss Graham fondly. 

" Do the girls of Buffalo still come out at night 
and dance by the light of the moon ?" 

'' What !" 

" Ah, I see," said Colville, peering at her under 
his thoughtfully knitted brows, " you do belong to 
another era. You don't remember the old negro 
minstrel song." 

" No," said Miss Graham. " I can only remember 
the end of the war." 

"How divinely young !" said Colville. "Well," 
he added, "I wish that French lady could have 
overheard us. Miss Graham. I think she would 
have changed her mind about Americans strikin'' 
the note of personality in their talk." 

"Oh!" exclaimed the girl reproachfully, after a 
moment of swift reflection and recognition, " I don't 
see how you could let me do it ! You don't suppose 



 

that I should have talked so with every one ? It 
was because you were another American, and such 
an old friend of Mrs, Bo wen's." 

' That is what I shall certainly tell the French 
lady if she attacks me about it," said Colville. He 
glanced carelessly toward the end of the room, and 
saw the young clergyman taking leave of Mrs. 
Bo wen ; all the' rest of the company were gone. 
"Bless me ! " he said, " I must be going." 

Mrs. Bowen had so swiftly advanced upon him 
that she caught the last words. "Why?" she asked. 

" Because it 's to-morrow, I suspect, and the invi- 
tation was for one day only." 

" It was a season ticket,'' said Mrs. Bowen, with 
gay hospitality, ' and it isn't to-morrow for half an 
hour yet. I can't think of letting you go. Come 
up to the fire, all, and let 's sit down by it. It 's at 
its very best." 

Effie looked a pretty surprise and a pleasure in 
this girlish, burst from her mother, whose habitual 
serenity made it more striking in contrast, and she 
forsook Miss Graham's hand and ran forward and 
disposed the easy-chairs comfortably about the 
hearth. 

Colville and Mrs. Bowen suddenly found them- 
selves upon those terms which often succeed a long 
separation with people who have felt kindly toward 
each other at a former meeting and have parted 
friends : they were much more intimate than they 
had supposed themselves to be, or had really any 
reason for being. 



 

"Which one of your guests do you wish me to 
offer up, Mrs. Bowen V he asked, from the hollow 
of the arm-chair, not too low, which he had sunk 
into. With Mrs. Bowen in a higher chair at his 
right hand, and Miss Graham intent upon him from 
the sofa on his left, a sense of delicious satisfaction 
filled him from head to foot. " There isn't one I 
would spare if you said the word." 

" And there isn't one I want destroyed, I 'm sorry 
to say," answered Mrs. Bowen. " Don't you think 
they were all very agreeable V 

" Yes, yes ; agreeable enough — agreeable enough, 
I suppose. But they stayed too long. When I 
think we might have been sitting here for the last 
half-hour, if they 'd only gone sooner, I find it pretty 
hard to forgive them." 

Mrs. Bowen and Miss Graham exchanged glances 
above his head — a glance which demanded, " Didn't 
I tell you ?" for a glance that answered, " Oh, he 
is !" Effie Bowen's eyes widened ; she kept them 
fastened upon Colville in silent worship. 

He asked who were certain of the company that he 
had noticed, and Mrs. Bowen let him make a little 
fun of them : the fun was very good-natured. He 
repeated what the German had said about the 
worldly ambition of American girls ; but she would 
not allow him so great latitude in this. She said 
they were no worldlier than other girls. Of course, 
they were fond of society, and some of them got a 
little spoiled. But they were in no danger of be- 
coming too conventional. . 



 

Colville did not insist. " I missed the military 
to-night, Mrs. Bowen," he said. " I thought one 
couldn't get through an evening in Florence without 
officers V 

"We have them when there is dancing," returned 
Mrs. Bowen. 

" Yes, hut they don't know anything but dancing," 
Miss Graham broke in. " I like some one who can 
talk something besides compliments." 

" You are very peculiar, you know, Imogene," 
urged Mrs. Bowen gently. " I don't think our young 
men at home do much better in conversation, if you 
.come to that, though." 

" Oh, young men, yes ! They 're the same every- 
where. But here, even when they 're away along in 
the thirties, they think that girls can only enjoy 
flattery. I should like a gentleman to talk to me 
without a single word or look to show that he 
thought I was good-looking." 

" Ah, how could he ? " Colville insinuated, and 
the young girl coloured. 

"I mean, if I were pretty. This everlasting 
adulation is insulting." 

"Mr. Morton doesn't flatter," said Mrs. Bowen 
thoughtfully, turning the feather screen she held 
at her face, now edgewise,- now flatwise, toward 
Colville. 

" Oh no," owned Miss Graham. " He 's a clergy- 
man." 

Mrs Bowen addressed herself to Colville. " You 
must go to hear him some day. He 's very inter- 



 

esting, if you don't mind his being rather Low 

CUmidk." ""' 

Colville was going to pretend to an advanced 
degree of ritualism ; but it occurred to him that it 
might be a serious matter to Mrs. Bowen, and he 
asked instead who was the Rev. Mr. Waters. 

"Oh, isn't he lovely?" cried Miss Graham. 
" There, Mrs. Bowen ! Mr. Waters's manner is 
what I call truly complimentary. He always talks 
to you as if he expected you to be interested in 
serious matters, and as if you were his intellectual 
equal. And he 's so happy here in Florence ! He 
gives you the impression of feeling every breath he 
breathes here a privilege. You ought to hear him 
talk about Savonarola, Mr. Colville." 

" Well," said Colville, " I 've heard a great many 
people talk about Savonarola, and I 'm rather glad 
he talked to me about American girls.'' 

" American girls ! " uttered Miss Graham, in a 
little scream. " Did Mr. Waters talk to you about 
girls ? " 

" Yes. Why not ? He was probably in love with 
one once." 

"Mr. Waters?" cried the girl. "What non- 
sense ! " 

'' Well, then, with some old lady. Would you 
like that better ? " ' 

Miss Graham looked at Mrs. Bowen for permission, 
as it seemed, and then laughed, but did not attempt 
any reply to Colville. 

" You find even that incredible of such pyramidal 



 

antiquity," he resumed. " Well, it is hard to be- 
lieve. I told him what that German said, and we 
agreed beautifully about another type of American 
girl which we said we preferred." 

"Oh! What could it heV demanded Miss 
Graham. 

'• Ah, it wouldn't be so easy to say right ofif-hand," 
answered Oolville indolently. 

Mrs. Bowen put her hand under the elbow of the 
arm holding her' screen. " I don't believe I should 
agree with you so well," she said, apparently with a 
sort of didactic intention. 

They entered into a discussion wliich is always 
fruitful with Americans — the discussion of American 
girlhood, and Colville contended for the old national 
"ideal of girlish liberty as wide as the continent, as 
fast as the Mississippi. Mrs. Bowen withstood him 
with delicate firmness. "Oh," he said, "you're 
Europeanised." 

" I certainly prefer the European plan of bringing 
up girls," she replied steadfastly. " I shouldn't 
think of letting a daughter of mine have the freedom 
I had." 

" Well, perhaps it will come right in the next 
generation, then ; she will let her daughter have the 
freedom she hadn't." 

" Not if I 'm alive to prevent it,'' cried Mrs. Bowen. 

Colville laughed. " Which plan do you prefer, 
Miss Graham ?" 

" I don't think it 's quite the same now as it used 
to be," answered the girl evasively.  



" Well, then, all I can say is that if I had died 
before this chance, I had lived a blessed time. I 
perceive more and more that I 'iQ_Qb solete. I 'm in 
my dotage ; I prattle of the good old times, and the 
new spirit of the age flouts me. Miss Effie, do you 
prefer the Amer " 

" No, thank you," said her mother quickly. 
" Effie is out of the question. It 's time you were in 
bed, Effie." 

The child came with instant submissiveness and 
kissed her mother good-night; she kissed Miss 
Graham, and gave her hand to Colville. He held it a 
moment, letting her pull shyly away from him, while 
he lolled back in his chair, and laughed at her with 
his sad eyes. " It 's past the time I should be in bed, 
my dear, and I'm sitting up. merely because there's 
nobody to send me. It 's not that I 'm really such a 
very bad boy. Good night. Don't put me into a 
disagreeable dream ; put me into a nice one." The 
child bridled at the mild pleasantry, and when 
Colville released her hand she suddenly stooped 
forward and kissed him. 

" You 're so funny !" she cried, and ran and escaped 
beyond the portikre. 

Mrs. Bowcn stared in the same direction, but not 
with severity. " Eeally, Effie has been carried a 
little beyond herself." 

"Well," said Colville, "that's one conquest since 
I came to Florence. And merely by being funny ! 
When I was in Florence before, Mrs. Bowen," he 
continued, after a moment, " there were two ladies 



 

here, and I used to go about quite freely with either 
of them. They were both very pretty, and we were 
all very young. Don't you think it was charming V 
Mrs. Bowen coloured a lovely red, and smiled, but 
made no other response. " Florence has changed 
very much for. the worse since that time. There 
used to Be a pretty flower-girl with a wide-flapping 
straw hat, who flung a heavy bough full of roses 
into my lap when she met me driving across the 
Carraja bridge. I spent an hour looking for that 
girl to-day, and couldn't find her. The only flower- 
girl I could find was a fat one of fifty, who kept me 
fifteen minutes in Via Tornabuoni while she was 
fumbling away at my button-hole, trying to poke 
three second-hand violets and a sickly daisy into it. 
Ah,_youth ! youth ! I suppose a young fellow could 
have found that other flower-girl at a glance ; but 
my old eyes ! No, we belong, each of us, to our own 
generation. Mrs. Bowen," he said, with a touch of 
tragedy — whether real or aff'ected, he did not well 
know himself — in his hardiness, " what has become 
of Mrs. Pilsbury ? " 

"-Mrs. Milbury, you mean? " gasped Mrs. Bowen, 
in aff"right at his boldness. 

" Milbury, Bilbury, Pilsbury — it 's all one, so long 
as it isn't " 

"They're living in Chicago!" she hastened to 
reply, as if she were afraid he was going to .say, " so 
long as it isn't Colville," and she could not have 
bome that. 

Colville clasped his hands at the back of his head 



 

and looked at Mrs. Bowen with eyes that let her 
know that he was perfectly aware she had been 
telling Miss Graham of his youthful romance, and 
that lie had now touched it purposely. " And you 
wouldn't," he said, as if that were quite relevant to 
what they had been talking about — " you wouldn't 
let Miss Graham go out walking alone with a dotard 
like me ? " 

" Certainly not," said Mrs. Bowen.
