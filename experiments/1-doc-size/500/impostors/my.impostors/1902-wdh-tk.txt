were in Tuskingum he should be all right again. 

She felt the ingratitude, not to say the perfidy, 
of his behavior, and she fortified herself indignantly 
against it; but it was not her constant purpose, or 
the doctor 's inflexible opinion, that prevailed with 
Kenton at last. A letter came one day for Ellen 
which she showed to her mother, and which her 
mother, with her distress obscurely relieved by a 
sense of .its powerful instrumentality, brought to 
the girl 's father. It was from that fellow, as they 
always called him, and it asked of the girl a hear 
ing upon a certain point in which, it had just come 
to his knowledge, she had misjudged him. He made 
no claim upon her, and only urged his wish to right 
himself with her because she was the one person 
in the whole world, after his mother, for whose 



 

good opinion he cared. With some tawdriness of sen 
timent, the letter was well worded; it was professedly 
written for the sole purpose of knowing whether, 
when she came back to Tuskingum, she would see 
him, and let him prove to her that he was not wholly 
unworthy of the kindness she had shown him when 
he was without other friends. 

"What does she say?" the judge demanded. 

" What do you suppose ?" his wife retorted. " She 
thinks she ought to see him." 

" Very well, then. We will go to Europe." 

" Not on my account !" Mrs. Kenton consciously 
protested. 

"No; not on your account, or mine, either. On 
Nelly 's account. Where is she? I want to talk 
with her." 

"And I want to talk with you. She 's out, with 
Lottie; and when she comes back I will tell her 
what you say. But I want to know what you 
think, first." 



Ill 



IT was some time before they arrived at a com 
mon agreement as to what Kenton thought, and 
when they reached it they decided that they must 
leave the matter altogether to Ellen, as they had 
done before. They would never force her to any 
thing, and if, after all that her mother could say, 
she still wished to see the fellow, they would not 
deny her. 

When it came to this, Ellen was a long time 
silent, so long a time that her mother was begin 
ning restively to doubt whether she was going to 
speak at all. Then she drew a long, silent breath. 
" I suppose I ought to despise myself, momma, for 
caring for him, when he 's never really said that 
he cared for me." 

" No, no," her mother faltered. 

"But I do, I do!" she gave way piteously. "I 
can 't help it ! He doesn 't say so, even now." 

" No, he doesn t." It hurt her mother to own the 
fact that alone gave her hope. 

The girl was a long time silent again before she 
asked, " Has poppa got the tickets ?" 

"Why, he wouldn t, Ellen, child, till he knew 
how you felt," her mother tenderly reproached her. 



 

"He d better not wait!" The tears ran silently 
down Ellen 's cheeks, and her lips twitched a little 
between these words and the next; she spoke as if 
it were still of her father, but her mother under 
stood. "If he ever does say so, don 't you speak 
a word to me, momma ; and don 't you let poppa." 

"No; indeed I won t," her mother promised. 
" Have we ever interfered, Ellen ? Have we ever 
tried to control you ?" 

" He would have said so, if he hadn 't seen that 
everybody was against him." The mother bore 
without reply the ingratitude and injustice that she 
knew were from the child 's pain and not from her 
will. "Where is his letter? Give me his letter!" 
She nervously twitched it from her mother 's hand 
and ran it into her pocket. She turned away to go 
and put off her hat, which she still wore from coming 
in with Lottie; but she stopped and looked over 
her shoulder at her mother. "I 'm going to an 
swer it, and I don 't want you ever to ask me what 
I ve said. Will you?" 

" No, I won t, Nelly." 

"Well, then!" 

The next night she went with Boyne and Lottie 
to the apartment overhead to spend their last even 
ing with the young people there, who were going 
into the country the next day. She came back 
without the others, who wished to stay a little longer, 
as she said, with a look of gay excitement in her 
eyes, which her mother knew was not happiness. 
Mrs. Kenton had an impulse to sweep into her lap 



 

the lithograph plans of the steamer, and the pas 
sage ticket which lay open on the table before 
herself and her husband. But it was too late 
to hide them from Ellen. She saw them, and 
caught up the ticket, and read it, and flung it 
down again. "Oh, I didn 't think you would do 
it!" she burst out; and she ran away to her room, 
where they could hear her sobbing, as they sat 
haggardly facing each other. 

" Well, that settles it," said Kenton at last, with 
a hard gulp. 

" Oh, I suppose so," his wife assented. 

On his part, now, he had a genuine regret for 
her disappointment from the sad safety of the 
trouble that would keep them at home; and on 
her part she could be glad of it if any sort of 
comfort could come out of it to him. 

" Till she says go," he added, " we ve got to 
stay." 

" Oh yes," his wife responded. " The worst of it 
is, we can 't even go back to Tuskingum." He looked 
up suddenly at her, and she saw that he had not 
thought of this. She made " Tchk !" in sheer amaze 
at him. 

" We won 't cross that river till we come to it," 
he said, sullenly, but half -ashamed. The next morn 
ing the situation had not changed overnight, as 
they somehow both crazily hoped it might, and at 
breakfast, which they had at a table grown more 
remote from others with the thinning out of the 
winter guests of the hotel, the father and mother 



 

sat down alone in silence which was scarcely broken 
till Lottie and Boyne joined them. 

" Where 's Ellen ?" the boy demanded. 

" She 's having her breakfast in her room," Mrs. 
Kenton answered. 

" She says she don 't want to eat anything," Lot 
tie reported. " She made the man take it away 
again." 

The gloom deepened in the faces of the father 
and mother, but neither spoke, and Boyne resumed 
the word again in a tone of philosophic specula 
tion. " I don 't see how I 'm going to get along with 
those European breakfasts. They say you can 't 
get anything but cold meat or eggs; and generally 
they don 't expect to give you anything but bread 
and butter with your coffee. I don 't think that 's 
the way to start the day, do you, poppa ?" 

Kenton seemed not to have heard, for he went 
on silently eating, and the mother, who had not 
been appealed to, merely looked distractedly across 
the table at her children. 

" Mr. Plumpton says he 's coming down to see 
us off," said Lottie, smoothing her napkin in her 
lap. " Do you know the time of day when the boat 
sails, momma?" 

"Yes," her brother broke in, "and if I had 
been momma I d have boxed your ears for the 
way you went on with him. You fairly teased him 
to come. The way Lottie goes on with men is a 
shame, momma." 

" What time does the boat sail, momma ?" Lottie 



 

blandly persisted. " I promised to let Mr. Plumpton 
know." 

"Yes, so as to get a chance to write to him," 
said Boyne. " I guess when he sees your spelling !" 

" Momma ! Do wake up ! What time does our 
steamer sail?" 

A light of consciousness came into Mrs. Kenton 's 
eyes at last, and she sighed gently. "We 're not 
going, Lottie." 

" Not going ! Why, but we ve got the tickets, and 
I ve told" 

"Your father has decided not to go, for the 
present. We may go later in the summer, or 
perhaps in the fall." 

Boyne looked at his father 's troubled face, and 
said nothing, but Lottie was not stayed from the 
expression of her feelings by any ill-timed con 
sideration for what her father 's might be. "I just 
know," she fired, "it 's something to do with that 
nasty Bittridge. He 's been a bitter dose to this 
family ! As soon as I saw Ellen have a letter I was 
sure it was from him ; and she ought to be ashamed. 
If I had played the simpleton with such a fellow 
I guess you wouldn 't have let me keep you from 
going to Europe very much. What is she going 
to do now? Marry him? Or doesn 't he want 
her to?" 

" Lottie !" said her mother, and her father glanced 
up at her with a face that silenced her. 

" When you ve been half as good a girl as Ellen 
has been, in this whole matter," he said, darkly, 



 

"it will be time for you to complain of the way 
you ve been treated." 

"Oh yes, I know you like Ellen the best," said 
the girl, defiantly. 

" Don 't say such a thing, Lottie !" said her mother. 
" Your father loves all his children alike, and I won 't 
have you talking so to him. Ellen has had a great 
deal to bear, and she has behaved beautifully. If 
we are not going to Europe it is because we have 
decided that it is best not to go, and I wish to 
hear nothing more from you about it." 

" Oh yes ! And a nice position it leaves me in, 
when I ve been taking good-bye of everybody ! Well, 
I hope to goodness you won 't say anything about 
it till the Plumptons get away. I couldn 't have 
the face to meet them if you did." 

" It won 't be necessary to say anything ; or you 
can say that we ve merely postponed our sailing. 
People are always doing that." 

" It 's not to be a postponement," said Kenton, so 
sternly that no one ventured to dispute him, the 
children because they were afraid of him, and 
their mother because she was suffering for him. 

At the steamship office, however, the authorities 
represented that it was now so near the date of 
his sailing that they could not allow him to 're 
linquish his passages except at his own risk. They 
would try to sell his ticket for him, but they could 
not take it back, and they could not promise to 
sell it. There was reason in what they said, but if 
there had been none, they had the four hundred 



 

dollars which Kenton had paid for his five berths, 
and they had at least the advantage of him in the 
argument by that means. He put the ticket back 
in his pocket-book without attempting to answer 
them, and deferred his decision till he could advise 
with his wife, who, after he left the breakfast-table 
upon his errand to the steamship office, had aban 
doned her children to their own devices, and gone 
up to scold Ellen for not eating. 

She had not the heart to scold her when she found 
the girl lying face downward in the pillow, with 
her thin arms thrown up through the coils and 
heaps of her loose-flung hair. She was so slight 
that her figure scarcely defined itself under the 
bedclothes ; the dark hair, and the white, outstretch 
ed arms seemed all there was of her. She did not 
stir, but her mother knew she was not sleeping. 
" Ellen," she said, gently, " you needn 't be troubled 
about our going to Europe. Your father has 
gone down to the steamship office to give back his 
ticket." 

The girl flashed her face round with nervous 
quickness. " Gone to give back his ticket !" 

" Yes, we decided it last night. He 's never really 
wanted to go, and " 

" But I don 't wish poppa to give up his ticket !" 
said Ellen. "He must get it again. I shall die if 
I stay here, momma. We have got to go. Can 't 
you understand that ?" 

Mrs. Kenton did not know what to answer. She 
had a strong superficial desire to shake her daugh- 



 

ter as a naughty child which has vexed its mother, 
but under this was a still stronger pity for her as a 
woman, which easily prevailed. " Why, but, Ellen 
dear! We thought from what you said last night " 

"But couldn 't you see?" the girl reproached her, 
and she began to cry, and turned her face into the 
pillow again and lay sobbing. 

"Well," said her mother, after she had given 
her a little time, "you needn 't be troubled. Your 
father can easily get the ticket again; he can tele 
phone down for it. Nothing has been done yet. 
But didn 't you really want to stay, then ?" 

"It isn 't whether I want to stay or not," Ellen 
spoke into her pillow. " You know that. You know 
that I have got to go. You know that if I saw 
him Oh, why do you make me talk ?" 

" Yes, I understand, child." Then, in the imperi 
ous necessity of blaming some one, Mrs. Kenton 
added: "You know how it is with your father. 
He is always so precipitate; and when he heard 
what you said, last night, it cut him to the heart. 
He felt as if he were dragging you away, and this 
morning he could hardly wait to get through his 
breakfast before he rushed down to the steamship 
office. But now it 's all right again, and if you 
want to go, we 'll go, and your father will only be 
too glad." 

" I don 't want father to go against his will. You 
said he never wanted to go to Europe." The girl 
had turned her face upon her mother again, and 
fixed her with her tearful, accusing eyes. 



" The doctors say he ought to go. He needs the 
change, and I think we should all be the better for 
getting away." 

" I shall not," said Ellen. " But if I don t" 

"Yes," said her mother, soothingly. 

" You know that nothing has changed. He hasn 't 
changed and I haven t. If he was bad, he 's as bad 
as ever, and I 'm just as silly. Oh, it 's like a 
drunkard! I suppose they know it 's killing them, 
but they can 't give it up! Don 't you think it 's 
very strange, momma? I don 't see why I should 
be so. It seems as if I had no character at all, and 
I despise myself so ! Do you believe I shall ever get 
over it? Sometimes I think the best thing for me 
would be to go into an asylum." 

" Oh yes, dear ; you 'll get over it, and forget it 
all. As soon as you see others other scenes 
and get interested " 

"And you don 't you don 't think I d better let 
him come, and " 

"Ellen!" 

Ellen began to sob again, and toss her head upon 
the pillow. " What shall I do? What shall I do?" 
she wailed. "He hasn 't ever done anything bad 
to me, and if I can overlook his his flirting with 
that horrid thing, I don 't know what the rest 
of you have got to say. And he says he can explain 
everything. Why shouldn 't I give him the chance, 
momma? I do think it is acting very cruel not 
to let him even say a word." 

"You can see him if you wish, Ellen," said her 



 

mother, gravely. " Your father and I have always 
said that. And perhaps it would be the best thing, 
after all." 

"Oh, you say that because you think that if I 
did see him, I should be so disgusted with him that 
I d never want to speak to him again. But what 
if I shouldn t?" 

" Then we should wish you to do whatever you 
thought was for your happiness, Ellen. We can 't 
believe it would be for your good; but if it would 
be for your happiness, we are willing. Or, if you 
don 't think it 's for your happiness, but only for 
his, and you wish to do it, still we shall be willing, 
and you know that as far as your father and I are 
concerned, there will never be a word of reproach 
not a whisper." 

" Lottie would despise me ; and what would Rich 
ard say?" 

"Richard would never say anything to wound 
you, dear, and if you don 't despise yourself, you 
needn 't mind Lottie." 

"But I should, momma; that 's the worst of it! 
I should despise myself, and he would despise me 
too. No, if I see him, I am going to do it because 
I am selfish and wicked, and wish to have my own 
way, no matter who is harmecrby it, or anything; 
and I 'm not going to have it put on any other 
ground. I could see him," she said, as if to her 
self, " just once more only once more and then 
if I didn 't believe in him, I could start right off to 
Europe." 



 

Her mother made no answer to this, and Ellen 
lay awhile apparently forgetful of her presence, in 
wardly dramatizing a passionate scene of dismissal 
between herself and her false lover. She roused 
herself from the reverie with a long sigh, and her 
mother said, " Won 't you have some breakfast, now, 
Ellen?" 

" Yes ; and I will get up. You needn 't be troubled 
any more about me, momma. I will write to him 
not to come, and poppa must go back and get his 
ticket again." 

"Not unless you are doing this of your own 
free will, child. I can 't have you feeling that we 
are putting any pressure upon you." 

"You 're not. I 'm doing it of my own will. If 
it isn 't my free will, that isn 't your fault. I wonder 
whose fault it is? Mine, or what made me so silly 
and weak?" 

"You are not silly and weak," said her mother, 
fondly, and she bent over the girl and would have 
kissed her, but Ellen averted her face with a piteous 
"Don t!" and Mrs. Kenton went out and ordered 
her breakfast brought back. 

She did not go in to make her eat it, as she would 
have done in the beginning of the girl 's trouble; 
they had all learned how much better she was for 
being left to fight her battles with herself single-
