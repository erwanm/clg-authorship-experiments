small hewn stones, laid so as to leave little trenches 
of earth between them. There was a hard path, 
newly swept, leading to the square door of the house, 
and on the doorpost were clearly written certain 
characters in Hebrew. 

Gilbert knocked on the door, not loudly, with the 
hilt of his dagger, but no one answered ; and 
again louder, but there was no sound from within. 
Then he shook the door, trying whether it would 
open of itself by a push ; but it was fast, and the two 
windows of the house that looked out on each side 
of the door were barred also. 



 

" They think that some great force is with us, and 
are afraid," said the Jewish boy. " Speak to them, 
sir, for they do not understand my tongue." 

And the interpreter explained what he said. Then 
Gilbert spoke in English, for he supposed that Cur- 
boil's men must be Englishmen, but the Jewish boy 
knew that the words should sound otherwise. 

" In Greek, sir ! Speak to them in Greek, for 
they are all Greeks. That is why they are afraid. 
All Greeks are afraid." 

The interpreter began to speak in Greek, clear and 
loud, but no sound came. Yet when Gilbert put his 
ear to the door he thought that he heard something 
like a child's moaning. It had a sound of pain in it, 
and his blood rose at the thought that some weak 
creature was being hurt. So he took little Alric's 
leathern belt, such as grooms wear, and bound it 
round his hand to guard the flesh, and he struck the 
door where the leaves joined in the middle, once and 
twice and three times, and it began to open inward, 
so that they could see the iron bolt bent half double. 
Then with his shoulder he forced it in, so that the 
bolt slipped from the socket, and the leaves flew open. 

There was a little court within, around which the 
house was built, with a well for rain-water in the 
middle, after the fashion that was half Roman and 
half Eastern. Gilbert went in, and bade all be 
silent that he might hear whence the moaning came ; 
for it was more distinct now, and it seemed to come 
from the well, with a little splashing of water ; so he 
went and looked down, and when he saw what was 
there he cried aloud for fear. 






For there he saw an upturned face, half dead, with 
a white thing bound across the mouth, and hands tied 
together, and struggling to strike the water, but heav- 
ily weighted i and it was the face of Beatrix, two 
fathoms below him. There were holes opposite each 
other, in the two sides of the well, for a man's hands 
and feet, for climbing down into the cistern; and 
Gilbert lost no moment, but began to descend at once ; 
yet long before he had got the bound hands together 
in his own, stooping and himself in peril of falling, 
the face had sunk below the bubbling water. 

With his feet firmly planted in the holes, and 
standing as it might be astride of the well, he lifted 
the girl up ; and though she was so slight, it was one 
of the hardest things he ever had to do, for her 
clothes were full of water, and he was at a disadvan- 
tage ; nor could his men help him till he had raised 
her so high that he could rest her weight on his 
right knee and against his own body. Then the 
others climbed down and slipped their belts under 
her arms, and she was taken out in safety and laid 
upon the pavement of the little court. And then 
the Jewish boy went to call his mother from the 
house of her sister, where they two had gone to live, 
for Beatrix had need of a woman. 

Gilbert knelt down and laid her head upon Dun- 
stan's coat folded together, and covered her with his 
own mantle, gazing into the unconscious face, small 
and pale and pitiful, and he remembered how he had 
seen it last in Antioch, full of anger and unbelief, so 
that he had turned and left what he loved just when 
evil was at hand ; and his heart stood still, and then 



 

smote him in his breast, and stood still again, as the 
smith's hammer is poised in the air between the strokes. 

Beatrix did not move and seemed not to breathe, 
lying as one dead, and suddenly Gilbert believed 
that there was no life left in her. He tried to speak 
to Dunstan, but he could make no sound, for his 
tongue and his throat were suddenly parched and 
paralyzed, so that he was dumb in his grief ; but he 
took the small white hands, with the wrists all cut by 
the cords, and folded them upon the breast, and he 
took his cross-hilted dagger with its sheath, and laid 
it between the hands for a cross, and gently tried to 
close the haK-opened eyes. 

Then, when Dunstan saw what his master meant, 
he touched him on the shoulder and spoke to him. 

" She is not dead," he said. 

Gilbert started and looked up at him, and saw that 
he was in earnest ; but the man's lean face was drawn 
with anxiety. 

" Sir," said Dunstan, " will you let me touch the 
Lady Beatrix?" 

The knight's brow darkened, for that a churl's 
hands should touch a high-born lady's face seemed 
to him something monstrous and against nature ; but 
in the moment he had forgotten something. 

" She is quite dead," he tried to say. 

Then Dunstan spoke sadly, kneeling down beside 
her. 

"This lady is half my sister," he said. "I have 
some skill with half-drowned persons. Let me save 
her, sir, unless we are to let her die before our eyes. 
A gipsy taught me what to do." 





The cloud passed from Gilbert's face, but still he 
did not believe. 

" In heaven's name, do what you can, try what you 
know, and quickly ! " he said. 

" Help me, then," said Dunstan. 

So he did as all skilled persons know how to do 
with half-drowned people, though only the gipsies 
knew it then. They turned her body gently so that 
the clear water ran from her parted lips, and laying her 
down again, they took her arms and drew them over 
her head, stretched them out, and brought them down 
to her sides, again and again, so as to make her 
breathe, and the breath was drawn in and breathed 
out again with a delicate foam that clung to her lips. 

Still Sir Gilbert &id not believe, and though he 
helped his man, in the despair of the instant, and in 
the horror of losing the least chance of life, it all 
seemed to him a desecration of the most dear dead, 
and more than once he would have let the poor little 
arm rest, rather than make it limply follow the 
motion Dunstan gave to the other. 

" She is quite, quite dead," he said again. 

" She is alive," answered Dunstan ; " stop not now 
one moment, or we shall lose her." 

His dark face glowed, and his unwinking eyes 
watched her face for the least sign of life. Ten 
minutes, a quarter of an hour, passed, and time 
seemed facing death — the swift against the immov- 
able and eternal. Gilbert, the strong and master- 
ful in fight, humbly and anxiously watched his 
man's looks for the signs of hope, as if Dunstan had 
been the wisest physician of all . mankind ; and 





indeed in that day there were few physicians who 
knew how to do what the man was doing. And 
at last the glow in his face began to fade, and Gil- 
bert's heart sank, and the horror of so disturbing 
the dead came upon him tenfold, so that he let the 
slender arm rest on the stones, and sighed. But 
Dunstan cried out fiercely to him. 

" For your life, go on ! She is alive I See ! 
See I " 

And even as Gilbert sadly shook his head in the 
last collapse of belief, the long lashes quivered a 
little with the lids and were still, and quivered 
again, and then again, and the eyes opened wide 
and staring, but broad awake; and then the deli- 
cate body shook and was half convulsed by the 
miracle of life restored, and the slight arms quick- 
ened with nervous strength, resisting the men's 
strong hands, and a choking cough brought the 
bright colour to the pale cheeks. 

Then Gilbert lifted her from the pavement to the 
stone rim of the well, that she might breathe better, 
and presently the choking ceased, so that she lay 
quite still with her head against his breast, and her 
weight in his arms. But still she did not speak, 
and the man's heart beat furiously with joy, and 
then stood still in fear, lest the worst should come 
again, whereof there was no danger ; but he did not 
know, and Dunstan and Alrio were suddenly gone, 
seeking wine in the house. Just when the girl 
seemed to be sinking into a swoon they brought a 
short draught of Syrian wine in an earthen cup ; for 
little Alric was not wise, but he would have found 





wine in the sandy desert, and he had gone straight to 
a corner where a leathern bottle with a wooden plug 
was hung up in a cool place. 

Beatrix drank, and revived again, and looked up 
to Gilbert. 

" I knew you would come," she said faintly, and 
she smiled, but Gilbert could not speak. 

By this time the Jewish boy had brought his 
mother, and they carried the girl into a room, and the 
woman took care of her kindly, fearing lest a Chris- 
tian should die in her husband's house, and also 
lest she should not be paid the value of the rent, 
but with womanly gentleness also, wrapping her 
in dry clothes of her own before she laid her to rest. 

For Arnold de Curboil's servants had been all 
Greeks, and when they had learned that their 
master had been killed in the night, they had 
bolted and barred the house, and had bound Beatrix 
and her Norman tirewoman hand and foot and 
gagged their mouths with cloths, in order that they 
might carry o£E the rich plunder, but at first they 
had not meant to kill the women. Only when they 
were just about to slip away, one at a time, so as to 
escape notice, they held a council, and the most of 
them said that it would be better to throw the 
women into the well, lest either of them should help 
the other, and getting loose, escape from the house 
and cause a pursuit. So they threw the Norman 
woman down first, and when they saw that she sank 
the third time, being drowned, they threw Beatrix 
after her. But the well was not so deep as they 
had thought, and was narrow, so that Beatrix had 



 

kept her head above the water a long time, her feet 
just touching the body of her drowned servant. 
And in this way the faithful woman had saved her 
mistress after she was dead. When this was known, 
they took her from the well and bore her to burial 
without the city, while Beatrix was asleep. 

That night Gilbert and Dunstan lay on their cloaks 
within the half -broken door of the house, which could 
not be bolted, for they were tired, having watched 
by the Sepulchre all the night before that ; and little 
Alric kept watch in the courtyard, walking up and 
down lest he should sleep, for the Syrian wine might 
have made him drowsy, and he had the whole bottle 
to himself. But he drank slowly and thoughtfully, 
and when he felt that his head was not clear, he 
let the wine alone, and walked up and down a long 
time talking to himself and warning himself to 
keep sober. This being accomplished, he swallowed 
another draught, wisely sipping it by half mouthfuls, 
and then walked again ; and so all night, and in the 
dawn he was as fresh and rosy and sober as ever, but 
the big leathern bottle lay quite flat and disconsolate 
on the pavement ; for he came of the old English 
archers, who were good men at a bowl, and steady on 
their legs. 

In the morning Gilbert awoke and sat up, on the 
pavement, and as Alric came near he made a sign that 
he should not wake Dunstan, but let him rest. He 
looked at the sleeper's face, and thought how much 
this servant of his had suffered, being quite half as 
gentle by birth as he himself ; and he remembered 
how the man had fought ever bravely, and had shed 





his blood, and had never taken gifts of money from 
his master, save for great necessity, and had asked 
for a sword rather than for a tunic when, he had 
raised the riot to save Beatrix and the Queen in 
Nicsea; and Gilbert was ashamed that such a man, 
who was in truth the eldest born of a great house, 
should be a starving servant. So when Dunstan 
opened his eyes and started up at seeing his master 
awake, Gilbert spoke to him. 

"You have fought with me," he said, "you have 
endured with me, we have fasted together on the 
march, and we have drunk of the same spring in 
battle while the arrows fell about us, and now, God 
willing, we are to be brothers, when I wed the Lady 
Beatrix, and but for you I should be mourning by 
her grave to-day. It is not meet that we should be 
any longer master and man, for you have gentle 
blood in you, of a great house." 

" Sir Gilbert," murmured Dunstan, flushing darkly, 
" you are very kind to me, but I will not have gentle- 
hood of a father who was a murderer and a thief." 

" You prove yourself gentle by that speech," an- 
swered Gilbert. "Had he no other blood to give 
you than his own? Then the Lady Beatrix is also 
the daughter of a thief and a murderer." 

" And of a lady of great lineage. That is differ- 
ent. I am no peer of my lady sister. But if so be 
that I may have a name, and be called gentle, then, 
sir, I pray you, beg of our sovereign in England that 
I may be called by a new name of my own, that my 
ill birth may be forgotten." 

" And so I will," said Gilbert, " for it is better thus." 



 

Afterwards he kept his word, and when she had 
her own again, Beatrix gave him a third share of her 
broad lands, to hold in fief to Gilbert Warde, though 
he had no rightful claim ; and because he had saved 
her life, he was called Dunstan Le Sauveur, because 
he had saved her and many ; and he had favour of 
King Henry and fought bravely, and was made a 
knight, and raised up an honourable race. 

But on that morning in Jerusalem, in the little 
court, Beatrix came out, still weak and weary, and 
sat beside Gilbert in the shade of the wall, with her 
hand between his, and the light in her face. 

" Gilbert," she said, when she had told him what 
had happened to her untH then, " when I was angry 
and unbelieving in the Queen's chamber in Antioch, 
why did you turn and leave me, seeing that I was in 
the wrong ? " 

" I was angry, too," he answered simply. 

But womanlike, she answered him again. 

"That was foolish. You should have taken me 
roughly in your arms and kissed me, as you did by 
the river long ago. Then I should have believed 
you, as I do now." 

"But you would not believe my words, nor the 
Queen's," he said, " nor even when she gave herself 
up to the King, to prove herself true, would you 
believe her." 

" If men only knew ! " Beatrix laughed softly her 
little bird laugh that had the music of a spring 
day. 

" If men knew — what ? " 

"If men knew — " She paused, and blushed, and 





laughed again. "If men knew how women love 
sweet words when they are happy, and sharp deeds 
when they are angry ! That is what I mean. I 
would have given my blood and the Queen's king- 
dom for a kiss when you left me standing there." 

" I wish I had known ! " exclaimed Gilbert, happy 
but half perplexed.. 

" You ought to have known," answered the girl. 

Her eyebrows were raised a little with the haH- 
pathetic look he loved, while her mouth smiled. 

" I shall never understand," he said, but he began 
to laugh too. 

" I will tell you. In the first place, I shall never 
be angry with you again — never ! Do you believe 
me, Gilbert?" 

"Of course I do," he answered, having nothing 
else to say. 

" Very well. But if I ever should be — " 

" But you just said that you never would be ! " 

"I know; but if I should — just once — then 
take me in your arms, and say nothing, but kiss me 
as you did that day by the river." 

" I understand," he said. " Are you angry now ?" 
But he was laughing. 

"Almost," she answered, glancing sideways in a 
anile. 

"Not quite?" 

" Yes, quite ! " And her eyes darkened under the 
drooping lids. 

Then he held her so close to him that she was 
half breathless, and kissed her till it hurt, and she 
turned pale again, and her eyes were closed. 




THE WAY OF THE CROSS 



 

" You see," she said very faintly, " I believe you 

now ! " 

Here ends the story of Gilbert Warde's crusading ; 
for he had reached the end of his Via Crucis in the 
Holy City, and had at last found peace for his soul, 
and light and rest for his heart, after many troubles 
and temptations, and after much brave fighting for 
the good cause of the Faith against unbelievers. 

After that he fought again v?ith the army at 
Damascus, and saw how the princes betrayed one 
another, when the Emperor Conrad had come again, 
so that the siege of the strong town came to naught, 
and the armies were scattered among the rich gar- 
dens to gather fruit and drink strong wine, while 
their leaders wrangled. Also at Ascalon he drew 
sword again, and again he saw failure hanging over all, 
like an evil shadow, and chilling the courage in men, 
so that there was murmuring, and clamouring for 
the homeward path. There he saw how the great 
armies went to ruin and fell to pieces, because, as 
the holy Bernard had known, there was not the 
faith of other days, and also because there was no 
great leader, as Eleanor had told the abbot himself 
at Vezelay ; and it was a sad sight, and one to sicken 
the souls of good men. 

But though he fought with all his might when 
swords were out, there was no sadness in him for all 
these things, for life and hope were bright before 
him. Little by little, too, he had heard how all the 
poor pilgrims left at Attalia had perished; but he 
knew that if he had led them, Beatrix would have 





died there in the court of the little house in Jerusa- 
lem, and he held her life more dear than the lives of 
many, whom his own could hardly have saved. 

Moreover, and last of all, he had learned and 
understood that the cause of God lies not buried 
among stones in any city, not even in the most holy
