plates of the rare substance, each of these, in- 
cluding those of the two wings of the exquisitely 
convex door, contributing to the artful, the total 
rotundity. The series of encased drawers worked 
to and fro of course with straight sides, but also 
with small bowed fronts, these made up of the 
same adjusted plates. The whole, its infinite 





 

neatness exhibited, proved a wonder of wasted 
ingenuity, and Rosanna, pronouncing herself stu- 
pid not to have anticipated him, rendered all 
justice, under her friend's admiring emphasis, to 
this choicest of her resources. Of how they had 
come by it, either she or her sparing parent, she 
couldn't at once bethink herself: on their taking 
the Newport house for the few weeks her direc- 
tion had been general that an assortment of odds 
and ends from New York should disperse itself, 
for mitigation of bleakness, in as many of the 
rooms as possible; and with quite different matters 
to occupy her since she had taken the desired 
effect for granted. Her father's condition had 
precluded temporary inmates, and with Gray's 
arrival also in mind she had been scarce aware 
of minor importances. "Of course you know — 
I knew you would !" were the words in which 
she assented to his preference for the ivory tower 
and which settled for him, while he made it beau- 
tifully slide, the fact that the shallowest of the 
drawers would exactly serve for his putting his 
document to sleep. So then he slipped it in, re- 
joicing in the tight fit of the drawer, carefully 
making the two divisions of the protective door 
meet, turning the little gold key. in its lock and 
finally, with his friend's permission, attaching the 
key to a small silver ring carried in his pocket 
and serving for a cluster of others. With this 
question at rest it seemed at once, and as with 





 

an effect out of proportion to the cause, that a 
great space before them had been cleared: they 
looked at each other over it as if they had be- 
come more intimate, and as if now, in the free 
air, the enormities already named loomed up 
again. All of which was expressed in Gray's 
next words. 

"May I ask you, in reference to something 
you just now said, whether my uncle took action 
for leaving me money before our meeting .could 
be in question ? Because if he did, you know, I 
understand less than ever. That he should want 
to see me if he was thinking of me, that of course 
I can conceive; but that he shouldn't wait till 
he had seen me is what I find extraordinary." 

If she gave him the impression of keeping her 
answer back a little, it wasn't, he was next to 
see, that she was not fully sure of it. "He had 
seen you." 

"You mean as a small boy?" 

"No — at this distance of time that didn't 
count." She had another wait, but also another 
assurance. "He had seen you in the great fact 
about you." 

"And what in the world do you call that ?" 

"Why, that you are more out of it all, out of 
the air he has breathed all his life and that in 
these last years has more and more sickened him, 
than anyone else in the least belonging to him, 
that he could possibly put his hand on." 





 

He stood before her with his hands in his 
pockets — he could study her now quite as she 
had studied himself. "The extent, Rosanna, to 
which you must have answered for me!" 

She met his scrutiny from between more nar- 
rowed lids. "I did put it all to him — I spoke for 
you as earnestly as one can ever speak for an- 
other. But you're not to gather from it," she 
thus a trifle awkwardly smiled, "that I have let 
you in for twenty millions, or for anything ap- 
proaching. He will have left you, by my con- 
viction, all he has; but he has nothing at all like 
that. That's all I'm sure of — of no details what- 
ever. Even my father doesn't know," she added; 
"in spite of its having been for a long time the 
thing he has most wanted to, most sat here, these 
weeks, on some chance of his learning. The 
truth, I mean, of Mr. Betterman's affairs." 

Gray felt a degree of relief at the restrictive 
note on his expectations which might fairly have 
been taken, by its signs, for a betrayed joy in their 
extent. The air had really, under Rosanna's 
touch, darkened itself with numbers; but what 
she had just admitted was a rift of light. In this 
light, which was at the same time that of her allu- 
sion to Mr. Gaw's unappeased appetite, his vision 
of that gentleman at the other house came back 
to him, and he said in a moment: "I see, I see. 
He tried to get some notion out of me." 

"Poor father!" she answered to this — but 
IS  



 

without time for more questions, as at the mo- 
ment she spoke the door of the room opened and 
Doctor Hatch appeared. He paused, softly por- 
tentous, where he stood, and so he met Rosanna's 
eyes. He held them a few seconds, and the effect 
was to press in her, to all appearance, the same 
spring our young man had just touched. "Poor, 
poor, poor father !" she repeated, but as if brought 
back to him from far away. She took in what 
had happened, but not at once nor without an 
effort what it called on her for; so that "Won't 
you come up ? " her informant had next to ask. 
To this, while Gray watched her, she rallied 
— "If you'll stay here." With which, looking 
at neither of them again, as the Doctor kept the 
door open, she passed out, he then closing it on 
her and transferring his eyes to Gray — who 
hadn't to put a question, so sharply did the 
raised and dropped hands signify that all was 
over. The fact, in spite of everything, startled 
our young man, who had with his companion a 
moment's mute exchange. 

"He has died while I've kept her here?" 
Doctor Hatch just demurred. "You kept. her. 
through her having sent for you to talk to you." 
"Yes, I know. But it's very extraordinary!" 
"You seem to make people extraordinary. 

You've made your uncle, you know !" 

"Yes indeed — but haven't I made him better ?" 
Gray asked. 





 

The Doctor again for a moment hesitated. 
"Yes — in the sense that he must be now at last 
really resting. But I go back to him." 

"I'll go with you of course," said Gray, look- 
ing about for his hat. As he found it he oddly 
remembered. "Why she asked me to dinner!" 

It all but amused the Doctor. "You inspire 
remarkable efforts." 

"Well, I'm incapable of making them." It 
seemed now queer enough. "I can't stay to 
dinner." 

"Then we'll go." With which however, Doc- 
tor Hatch was not too preoccupied to have had 
his attention, within the minute, otherwise taken. 
"What a splendid piece!" he exclaimed in pres- 
ence of the ivory tower. 

"It is splendid," said Gray, feeling its beauty 
again the brightest note in the strangeness; but 
with a pang of responsibility to it taking him 
too. "Miss Gaw has made me a present of it." 

"Already? You do work them!" — and the 
good physician fairly grazed again the act of 
mirth. "So you'll take it away?" 

Gray paused a moment before his acquisition, 
which seemed to have begun to guard, within 
the very minute, a secret of greater weight. Then 
"No, I'll come back to it," he said as they de- 
parted by the long window that opened to the 
grounds and through which Miss Mumby had 
brought him in. 





BOOK THIRD 

I 

"Why I haven't so much as seen him yet," 
Cissy perforce confessed to her friend, Mrs. Brad- 
ham's friend, everybody's friend, even, already 
and so coincidentally, Graham Fielder's; this 
recipient of her avowal having motored that day 
from Boston, after detention there under a neces- 
sity of business and the stress of intolerable heat, 
but having reached Newport in time for tea, a 
bath, a quick "change" and a still quicker im- 
pression of blest refreshment from the fine air 
and from various other matters. He had come 
forth again, during the time left him between 
these performed rites and the more formal dress- 
ing-hour, in undisguised quest of our young 
lady, who had so disposed certain signs of her 
whereabouts that he was to waste but few steps 
in selection of a short path over the longest stretch 
of lawn and the mass of seaward rocks forming 
its limit. Arriving to spend with the Bradhams 
as many or as few days as the conditions to be 
recognised on the spot might enjoin, this hero, 
Horton Vint, had alighted at one of those hours 
of brilliant bustle which could show him as all 





 

in his element if he chose to appear so, or could 
otherwise appeal at once to his perfect aptitude 
for the artful escape and the undetected counter- 
plot. But the pitch had by that moment dropped 
and the company dispersed, so far as the quarter 
before him was concerned : the tennis-ground was 
a velvet void, the afternoon breeze conveyed soft 
nothings — all of which made his occasion more 
spacious for Horton. Cissy, from below, her 
charmingly cool cove, had watchfully signalled 
up, and they met afresh, on the firm clear sand 
where the drowsy waves scarce even lapsed, with 
forms of intimacy that the ( sequestered spot 
happily favoured. The sense of waiting under- 
stood and crowned gave grace to her opened arms 
when the young man, as he was still called, erect, 
slim, active, brightly refreshed and, like herself, 
given the temperature, inconsiderably attired, 
first showed himself against the sky; it had cost 
him but a few more strides and steps, an easy 
descent, to spring to her welcome with the 
strongest answering emphasis. They met as 
on ground already so prepared that not an un- 
certainty, on either side, could make reunion less 
brave or confidence less fine; they had to effect 
no clearance, to stand off from no risk; and, ob- 
serving them thus in their freedom, you might 
well have asked yourself by what infallible tact 
they had mastered for intercourse such perfect 
reciprocities of address. You would certainly 

iS5 



 

have concluded to their entire confidence in 
these. "With a dozen people in the house it is 
luck," Horton had at once appreciatively said; 
but when their fellow-visitors had been handled 
between them for a minute or so only to collapse 
again like aproned puppets on removal of pressure 
from the squeak, he had jumped to the question 
of Gray Fielder and to frank interest in Cissy's 
news of him. This news, the death of Mr. Better- 
man that morning, quite sufficiently explained 
her inability to produce the more direct impres- 
sion; that worthy's nephew and heir, in close 
and more and more quickened attendance on 
him during the previous days, had been seen as 
yet, to the best of her belief, by no one at all but 
dear Davey — not counting of course Rosanna 
Gaw, of the fact of whose own bereavement as 
well Horton was naturally in possession, and who 
had made it possible, she understood, for their 
friend to call on Graham. 

"Oh Davey has called on Graham?" Horton 
was concerned to ask while they sat together on 
a rude worn slab. "What then, if he has told 
you, was his particular idea?" 

"Won't his particular idea," Cissy returned, 
"be exactly the one he won't have told me? 
What he did speak to me of yesterday morning, 
and what I told him I thought would be beautiful 
of him, was his learning by inquiry, in case your, 
friend could see him, whether there was any sort 





 

of thing he could do for him in his possible want 
of a man to put a hand on. Because poor Ro- 
sanna, for all one thinks of her," said the girl, 
" isn't exactly a man." 

Horton's attention was deeply engaged; his 
hands, a little behind him, rested, as props to 
his slight backward inclination, on the con- 
venient stone; his legs, extended before him, 
enabled him to dig in his heels a little, while his 
eyes, attached to the stretch of sea commanded 
by their rocky retreat, betrayed a fixed and 
quickened vision. Rich in fine lines and propor- 
tions was his handsome face — with scarce less, 
moreover, to be said of his lean, light and long- 
drawn, though so much more pointed and rounded 
figure. His features, after a manner of their own, 
announced an energy and composed an array 
that his expression seemed to disavow, or at 
least to be indifferent to, and had the practical 
effect of toning down; as if he had been conscious 
that his nose, of the bravest, strongest curve and 
intrinsically a great success, was too bold and 
big for its social connections, that his mouth pro- 
tested or at least asserted more than he cared to 
back it up to, that his chin and jaw were of too 
tactless an importance, and his fine eyes, above 
all, which suggested choice samples of the more 
or less precious stone called aquamarine, too dis- 
posed to darken with the force of a straight look 
— so that the right way to treat such an excess 





 

of resource had become for him quite the incon- 
gruous way, the cultivation of every sign and 
gage that liberties might be taken with him. He 
seemed to keep saying that he was not, tem- 
peramentally and socially, in his own exaggerated 
style, and that a bony structure, for instance, as 
different as possible from the one he unfortunately 
had to flaunt, would have been no less in har- 
mony with his real nature than he sought oc- 
casion to show it was in harmony with his con- 
duct. His hard mouth sported, to its visible 
relief and the admiration of most beholders, a 
beautiful mitigating moustache; his eyes wan- 
dered and adventured as for fear of their very 
own stare; his smile and his laugh went all lengths, 
you would almost have guessed, in order that 
nothing less pleasant should occupy the ground; 
his chin advanced upon you with a grace fairly 
tantamount to the plea, absurd as that might 
have seemed, that it was in the act of receding. 
Thus you gained the impression — or could do so 
if your fancy quickened to him — that he would 
perhaps rather have been as unwrought and un- 
finished as so many monstrous men, on the gen- 
eral peopled scene of those climes, appeared more 
and more to show themselves, than appointed to 
bristle with a group of accents that, for want of 
a sense behind them, could attach themselves 
but to a group of blanks. The sense behind the 
outward man in Horton Vint bore no relation, 





 

it incessantly signified, to his being importantly 
goodlooking; it was in itself as easily and freely 
human a sense, making as much for  personal re- 
assurance, as the appeal of opportunity in an 
enjoying world could ever have drawn forth and 
with the happy appearance of it confirmed by 
the whimsical, the quite ironic, turn given by the 
society in which he moved to the use of his name. 
It could never have been so pronounced and 
written Haughty if in spite of superficial ac- 
cidents his charming clever humility and so- 
ciability hadn't thoroughly established themselves. 
He lived in the air of jokes, and yet an air in which 
bad ones fell flat; and there couldn't have been 
a worse one than to treat his designation as true. 
It might have been, at the same time, scarce 
in the least as a joke that he presently said, in 
return for the remark on Cissy's part last re- 
ported: "Rosanna is surely enough of a man to 
be much more of one than Davey. However," 
he went on, "we agree, don't we? about the. mil- 
lion of men it Would have taken to handle Gussy. 
A Davey the more or the less, or with a shade 
more or less of the different sufficiency, would 
have made no difference in that question" — which 
had indeed no interest for them anyhow, he con- 
veyed, compared with the fun apparently pro- 
posed by this advent of old Gray. That, frankly, 
was to him, Horton, as amusing a thing as could 
have happened — at a time when if it hadn't been 





 

for Cissy's herself happening to be for him, by 
exception, a comfort to think of, there wasn't 
a blest thing in his life of the smallest interest. 
"It hadn't struck me as probable at all, this 
revulsion of the old man's," he mentioned, "and 
though Fielder must be now an awfully nice 
chap, whom you'll like and find charming, I 
own I didn't imagine he would come so tremen- 
dously forward. Over there, simply with his 
tastes, his 'artistic interests,' or literary ones, 
or whatever — I mean his array of intellectual 
resources and lack of any others — he was well 
enough, by my last impression, and I liked him 
both for his decent life and ways and for his liking 
me, if you can believe it, so extraordinarily much 
as he seemed to. What the situation appears 
most to mean, however, is that of a sudden he 
pops into a real light, a great blazing light visible 
from afar — which is quite a different affair. It 
can't not mean at least all sorts of odd things — 
or one has a right to wonder if it mayn't mean 
them." And Horton might have been taken up 
for a minute of silence with his consideration of 
some of these glimmering possibilities; a mo- 
ment during which Cissy Foy maintained their 
association by fairly, by quite visibly breathing 
with him in unison — after a fashion that testified 
more to her interest than any "cutting in" could 
have done. It would have been clear that they 
were far beyond any stage of association at which 





 

their capacity for interest in the contribution of 
either to what was between them should depend 
upon verbal proof. It depended in fact as little 
on any other sort, such for instance as searching 
eyes might invoke; she hadn't to look at her 
friend to follow him further — she but looked off 
to those spaces where his own vision played, and 
it was by pressing him close there that she fol- 
lowed. Her companion's imagination, by the 
time he spoke again, might verily have travelled 
far. 

"What comes to me is just the wonder of 
whether such a change of fortune may possibly 
not spoil him — he was so right and nice as he 
was. I remember he used really to exasperate 
me almost by seeming not to have wants, unless 
indeed it was by having only those that could 
be satisfied over there as a kind of matter of 
course and that were those I didn't myself have — 
in any degree at least that could make up for 
the non-satisfaction of my others. I suppose it 
amounted really," said Horton, "to the fact 
that, being each without anything to speak of 
in our pockets, or. then any prospect of anything, 
he accepted that because he happened to like
