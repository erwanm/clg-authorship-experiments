well as I can remember." 

" Go on ! " said the other. " What you givin' us ? " 
And then, to the two watchmen, " Search him." 

" Take off your coat and pants," said Bill, promptly, 
" and your boots." 

" Oh, I say ! " protested Hal. 

" Take 'em off ! " said the man, and clenched his fists. 
Hal took 'em off, and they proceeded to go through the 
pockets, producing a purse with the amount stated, also a 
cheap watch, a strong pocket knife, the tooth-brush, comb 
and mirror, and two white handkerchiefs, which they 
looked at contemptuously and tossed to the spittle-drenched 
floor. 

They unrolled the pack, and threw the clean clothing 
about. Then, opening the pocket-knife, they proceeded 
to pry about the soles and heels of the boots, and to cut 
open the lining of the clothing. So they found the ten 
dollars in the belt, which they tossed onto the table with 
the other belongings. Then the personage with the shield 
announced, " I fine you twelve dollars and sixty-seven 
cents, and your watch and knife." He added, with a 
grin, " You can keep your snot-rags." 

" Now see here ! " said Hal, angrily. " This is pretty 
raw!" 

" You get your duds on, young f ellow* and get out of 
here as quick as you can, or you'll go in your shirt-tail." 

But Hal was angry enough to have been willing to go 



 

in his skin. " You tell me who you are, and your au- 
thority for this procedure ? " 

" I'm marshal of the camp," said the man. 

" You mean you're an employe of the General Fuel 
Company? And you propose to rob me — " 

" Put him out, Bill," said the marshal. And Hal saw 
Bill's fists clench. 

"All right," he said, swallowing his indignation. 
"Wait till I get my clothes on." And he proceeded to 
dress as quickly as possible ; he rolled up his blanket and 
spare clothing, and started for the door. 

" Remember," said the marshal, " straight down the 
canyon with you, and if you show your face round here 
again, you'll get a bullet through you." 

So Hal went out into the sunshine, with a guard on 
each side of him as an escort. He was on the same moun- 
tain road, but in the midst of the company-village. In 
the distance he saw the great building of the breaker, 
and heard the incessant roar of machinery and falling 
coal. He marched past a double lane of company houses 
and shanties, where slattern women in doorways and dirty 
children digging in the dust of the roadside paused and 
grinned at him — for he limped as he walked, and it was 
evident enough what had happened to him. 

Hal had come with love and curiosity. The love was 
greatly diminished — ^ evidently this was not the force 
which kept the wheels of industry a-roll. But the curi- 
osity was greater than ever. What was there so care- 
fully hidden inside this coal-camp stockade? 

Hal turned and looked at Bill, who had showed signs 
of humour the day before. " See here," said he, " you 
fellows have got my money, and you've blacked my eye 
and kicked me blue, so you ought to be satisfied. Before 
I go, tell me about it, won't you ? " 

" Tell you what ? " growled Bill. 

"Why did I get this?" 



 

" Because you're too gay, kid. Didn't you know you 
had no business trying to sneak in here ? " 

" Yes," said Hal ; " but that's not what I mean. Why 
didn't you let me in at first ? " 

" If you wanted a job in a mine,'' demanded the man, 
" why didn't you go at it in the regular way ? " 

" I didn't know the regular way." 

" That's just it. And we wasn't takin' chances with 
you. You didn't look straight." 

"But what did you think I was? What are you 
afraid of ? " 

" Go on ! " said the man. " You can't work me ! " 

Hal walked a few steps in silence, pondering how to 
break through. " I see you're suspicious of me," he 
said. " I'll tell you the truth, if you'll let me." Then, 
as the other did not forbid him, " I'm a college boy, and 
I wanted to see life and shift for myself a while. I 
thought it would be a lark to come here." 

" Well," said Bill, " this ain't no foot-ball field. It's 
a coal-mine." 

Hal saw that his story had been accepted. " Tell me 
straight," he said, " what did you think I was ? " 

" Well, I don't mind telling," growled Bill. " There's 
union agitators trying to organise these here camps, and 
we ain't taking no chances with 'em. This company gets 
its men through agencies, and if you'd went and satisfied 
them, you'd 'a' been passed in the regular way. Or if 
you'd went to the office down in Pedro and got a pass, 
you'd 'a' been all right. But when a guy turns up at the 
gate, and looks like a dude and talks like a college per- 
fessor, he don't get by, see ? " 

" I see," said Hal. And then, " If you'll give me the 
price of a breakfast out of my money, I'll be obliged." 

" Breakfast is over," said Bill. " You sit round till 
the pinyons gets ripe." He laughed; but then, mellowed 
by his own joke, he took a quarter from his pocket and 



 

passed it to Hal. He opened the padlock on the gate and 
saw him out with a grin; and so ended Hal's first turn 
on the wheels of industry. 



 Hal Warner started to drag himself down the 
road, but was unable to make it. He got as far as a 
brooklet that came down the mountain-side, from which 
he might drink without fear of typhoid; there he lay the 
whole day, fasting. Towards evening a thunder-storm 
came up, and he crawled under the shelter of a rock, which 
was no shelter at all. His single blanket was soon soaked 
through, and he passed a night almost as miserable as 
the previous one. He could not sleep, but he could think, 
and he thought about what had happened to him. " Bill " 
had said that a coal mine was not a foot-ball field, but it 
seemed to Hal that the net impress of the two was very 
much the same. He congratulated himself that his pro- 
fession was not that of a union organiser. 

At dawn he dragged himself up, and continued- his 
journey, weak from cold and unaccustomed lack of food. 
In the course of the day he reached a power-station near 
the foot of the canyon. He did not have the price of a 
meal, and was afraid to beg; but in one of the group of 
buildings by the roadside was a store, and he entered and 
inquired concerning prunes, which were twenty-five cents 
a pound. The price was high, but so was the altitude, 
and as Hal found in the course of time, they explained 
the one by the other — not explaining, however, why the 
altitude of the price was always greater than the altitude 
of the store. Over the counter he saw a sign : " We buy 
scrip at ten per cent discount." He had heard rumours 
of a state law forbidding payment of wages in " scrip " ; 
but he asked no questions, and carried off his very light 
pound of prunes, and sat down by the roadside and 
munched them. 



V 



 

Just beyond the power-house, down on the railroad 
tracks stood a little cabin with a garden behind it. He 
made his way there, and found a one-legged old watchman. 
He asked permission to spend the night on the floor of the 
cabin ; and seeing the old fellow look at his black eye, he 
explained, "I tried to get a job at the mine, and they 
thought I was a union organiser." 

" Well," said the man, " I don't want no union organ- 
isers round here." 

" But I'm not one," pleaded Hal. 

" How do I know what you are ? Maybe you're a com- 
pany spy." 

"All I want is a dry place to sleep," said Hal. 
" Surely it won't be any harm for you to give me that." 

"I'm not so sure," the other answered. "However, 
you can spread your blanket in the corner. But don't 
you talk no union business to me." 

Hal had no desire to talk. He rolled himself in his 
blanket and slept like a man untroubled by either love or 
curiosity. In the morning the old fellow gave him a 
slice of corn bread and some young onions out of his 
garden, which had a more delicious taste than any break- 
fast that had ever been served him. When Hal thanked 
his host in parting, the latter remarked: "All right, 
young fellow, there's one thing you can do to pay me, and 
that is, say nothing about it. When a man has grey 
hair on his head and only one leg, he might as well be 
drowned in the creek as lose his job." 

Hal promised, and went his way. His bruises pained 
him less, and he was able to walk. There were ranch- 
houses in sight — it was like coming back suddenly to 
America ! 

 Hal had now before him a week's adventures as 
a hobo : a genuine hobo, with no ten dollar bill inside his 
belt to take the reality out of his experiences. He took 



 

stock of his worldly goods and wondered if he still looked 
like a dude. He recalled that he had a smile which had 
fascinated the ladies; would it work in combination with 
a black eye I Having no other means of support, he tried 
it on susceptible looking housewives, and found it so suc- 
cessful that he was tempted to doubt the wisdom of honest 
labour. He sang the Harrigan song no more, but instead 
the words of a hobo-song he had once heard : 

" Oh, what's the use of workin' when there's women 
in the land?" 

The second day he made the acquaintance of two other 
gentlemen of the road, who sat by the railroad-track toast- 
ing some bacon over a fire. They welcomed him, and 
after they had heard his story, adopted him into the fra- 
ternity and instructed him in its ways of life. Pretty 
soon he made the acquaintance of one who had been a 
miner, and was able to give him the information he 
needed before climbing another canyon. 

" Dutch Mike " was the name this person bore, for 
reasons he did not explain. He was a black-eyed and dan- 
gerous-looking rascalf and when the subject of mines and 
mining was broached, he opened up the flood-gates of an 
amazing reservoir of profanity. He was through with 
that game — Hal or any other God-damned fool might 
have his job for the asking. It was only because there 
were so many natural-born God-damned fools in the world 
that the game could be kept going. " Dutch Mike " went 
on to relate dreadful tales of mine-life, and to summon 
before him the ghosts of one pit-boss after another, con- 
signing them to the fires of eternal perdition. 

" I wanted to work while I was young," said he, " but 
now Pm cured, an' fer good." The world had come to 
seem to him a place especially constructed for the purpose 
of making him work, and every faculty he possessed was 
devoted to foiling this plot. Sitting by a camp-fire near 
the stream which ran down the valley, Hal had a merry 



 

time pointing out to " Dutch Mike " how he worked harder 
at dodging work than other men worked at working. The 
hobo did not seem to mind that, however — it was a mat- 
ter of principle with him, and he was willing to make 
sacrifices for his convictions. Even when they had sent 
hLn to the work-house, he had refused to work; he had 
been shut in a dungeon, and had nearly died on a diet 
of bread and water, rather than work. If everybody 
would do the same, he said, they would soon " bust things." 
Hal took a fancy to this spontaneous revolutionist, and 
travelled with him for a couple of days, in the course of 
which he pumped him as to details of the life of a miner. 
Most of the companies used regular employment agencies, 
as the guard had mentioned; but the trouble was, these 
agencies got something from your pay for a long time — 
the bosses were " in cahoots " with them. When Hal won- 
dered if this were not against the law, " Cut it out, Bo ! " 
said his companion. " When you've had a job for a while, 
you'll know that the law in a coal-camp is what your boss 
tells you." The hobo went on to register his conviction 
that when one man has the giving of jobs, and other men 
have to scramble for them, the law would never have much 
to say in the deal. Hal judged this a profound observa- 
tion, and wished that it might be communicated to the 
professor of political economy at Harrigan. 
. On the second night of his acquaintance with " Dutch 
Mike," their "jungle" was raided by a constable with 
half a dozen deputies; for a determined effort was being 
made just then to drive vagrants from the neighbourhood 
— or to get them to work in the mines. Hal's friend, who 
slept with one eye open, made a break in the darkness, and 
Hal followed him, getting under the guard of the raiders 
by a foot-ball trick. They left their food and blankets 
behind them, but " Dutch Mike " made light of this, and 
lifted a chicken from a roost to keep them cheerful through 
the night hours, and stole a change of underclothing off a 



 

clothes-line the next day. Hal ate the chicken, and wore 
the underclothing, thus beginning his career in crime. 

Parting from " Dutch Mike," he went back to Pedro. 
The hobo had told him that saloon-keepers nearly always 
had friends in the coal-camps, and could help a fellow to 
a job. So Hal began enquiring, and the second one re- 
plied, Yes, he would give him a letter to a man at North 
Valley, and if he got the job, the friend would deduct a 
dollar a month from his pay. Hal agreed, and set out 
upon another tramp up another canyon, upon the strength 
of a sandwich " bummed " from a ranch-house at the en- 
trance to the valley. At another stockaded gate of the 
General Fuel Company he presented his letter, addressed 
to a person named O'Callahan, who turned out also to be 
a saloon-keeper. 

The guard did not even open the letter, but passed Hal 
in at sight of it, and he sought out his man and applied 
for work. The man said he would help him, but would 
have to deduct a dollar a month for himself, as well as a 
dollar for his friend in Pedro. Hal kicked at this, and 
they bartered back and forth; finally, when Hall turned 
away and threatened to appeal directly to the " super," 
the saloon-keeper compromised on a dollar and a half. 

" You know mine-work ? " he asked. 

" Brought up at it," said Hal, made wise, now, in the 
ways of the world. 

" Where did you work ? " 

Hal named several mines, concerning which he had 
learned something from the hoboes. He was going by the 
name of " Joe Smith," which he judged likely to be found 
on the payroll of any mine. He had more than a week's 
growth of beard to disguise him, and had picked up some 
profanity as, well. 

The saloon-keeper took him to interview Mr. Alec Stone, 
pit-boss in Number Two mine, who inquired promptly: 
" You know anything about mules ? " 



 

"I worked in a stable," said Hal, "I know about 
horses." 

" Well, mules is different," said the man. " One of my 
stable-men got the colic the other day, and I don't know if 
he'll ever be any good again." 

" Give me a chance," said HaL " I'll manage them." 

The boss looked him over. " You look like a bright 
chap," said he. " I'll pay you forty-five a month, and if 
you make good I'll make it fifty." 

" All right, sir. When do I start in ? " 

" You can't start too quick to suit me. Where's your 
duds?'^ 

" This is all I've got," said Hal, pointing to the bundle 
of stolen underwear in his hand. 

" Well, chuck it there in the corner," said the man ; 
then suddenly he stopped, and looked at Hal, frowning. 
" You belong to any union ? " 

"Lord, no!" 

" Did you ever belong to any union ? " 

" No, sir. Never." 

The man's gaze seemed to imply that Hal was lying, 
and that his secret soul was about to be read. " You have 
to swear to that, you know, before you can work here." 

" All right," said Hal, " I'm willing." 

" I'll see you about it to-morrow," said the other. " I 
qjn't got the paper with me. By the way, what's your 
religion ? " 

" Seventh Day' Adventist." 

" Holy Christ ! What's that ? " 

" It don't hurt," said Hal. " I ain't supposed to work 
on Saturdays, but I do." 

" Well, don't you go preachin' it round here. We got 
our own preacher — you chip in fifty cents a month for 
him out of your wages. Come ahead now, and I'll take 
you down." And so it was that Hal got his start in 
life. 



 

 The mule is notoriously a profane and godless 
creature; a blind alley of Nature, so to speak, a mistake 
of which she is ashamed, and which she does not permit 
to reproduce itself. The thirty mules under Hal's charge 
had been brought up in an environment calculated to fos- 
ter the worst tendencies of their natures. He soon made 
the discovery that the " colic " of his predecessor had been 
caused by a mule's hind foot in the stomach; and he re- 
alised that he must not let his mind wander for an instant, 
if he were to avoid this dangerous disease. 

These mules lived their lives in the darkness of the 
earth's interior ; only when they fell sick were they taken 
up to see the sunlight and to roll about in green pastures. 
There was one of them called " Dago Charlie," who had 
learned to chew tobacco, and to rummage in the pockets 
of the miners and their " buddies." Not knowing how to 
spit out the juice, he would make himself ill, and then 
he would swear off from indulgence. But the drivers and 
the pit-boys knew his failing, and would tempt "Dago 
Charlie " until he fell from grace. Hal soon discovered 
this moral tragedy, and carried the pain of it in his soul 
as he went about his all-day drudgery. 

He went down the shaft with the first cage, which was 
very early in the morning. He fed and watered his 
charges, and helped to harness them. Then, when the 
last four hoofs had clattered away, he cleaned out the 
stalls, and mended harness, and obeyed the orders of any 
person older than himself who happened to be about. 

Next to the mules, his torment was the " trapper-boys," 
and other youngsters with whom he came into contact. 
He was a newcomer, and so they hazed him ; moreover, he 
had an inferior job — there seemed to their minds to be 
something humiliating and comic about the task of tend-* 
ing mules. These urchins came from a score of nations 
of Southern Europe and Asia; there were flat-faced Tar- 
tars and swarthy Greeks and shrewd-eyed little Japanese. 



 

They spoke a compromise language, consisting mainly of 
English curse words and obscenities; the filthiness which 
their minds had spawned was incredible to one born and 
raised in the sunlight. They alleged obscenities of their 
mothers and their grandmothers ; also of the Virgin Mary, 
the one mythological character they had heard of. Poor 
little creatures of the dark, their souls grimed and smut- 
ted even more quickly and irrevocably than their faces ! 

Hal had been advised by his boss to inquire for board 
at " Reminitsky's." He came up in the last car, at twi- 
light, and was directed to a dimly lighted building of 
corrugated iron, where upon inquiry he was met by a 
stout Russian, who told him he could be taken care of for 
twenty-seven dollars a month, this including a cot in a 
room with eight other single men. After deducting a 
dollar and a half a month for his saloon-keepers, fifty 
cents for the company clergyman and a dollar for the com- 
pany doctor, fifty cents a month for wash-house privileges 
and fifty cents for a sick and accident benefit fund, he had 
fourteen dollars a month with which to clothe himself, 
to found a family, to provide himself with beer and to- 
bacco, and to patronise the libraries and colleges endowed 
by the philanthropic owners of coal mines.
