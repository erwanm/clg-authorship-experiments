I've almost become a convert to your faith. He will make 
a charming husband, fond, indulgent, and all that, and I 
shall, no doubt, settle into a sensible wife. The old belief 
was all a farce the chimera of a school-girl's brain." 

She glanced at me in silence. 

" Dear Mrs. Lawrence," and my tone softened, " be pa- 
tient with me this brief while. Only, I don't want the 
talk and the congratulations until the latest moment." 

"We shall have to do something, though. We couldn't 
more than make the dresses in three weeks." 

" Do all that can be done quietly, then. Save the fuss 
and the tumult to the very last." 

With this we compromised. 

Aylmer and I parted tenderly, after the fashion of lov- 
ers. Was I hypocritical and insincere ? Heaven knows 
that I was honest in my resolve that I meant to use my 
utmost endeavors to make this man happy, when he laid 
" his sleeping life within my hands." But this restless mood 
tortured me into strange phantasies. 

Mr. St. John was polite, interested in all that demanded 



 

his concern ; but cold and withdrawn into self abstracted. 
He might have experienced a, momentary twinge of jeal- 
ousy concerning Aylmer, but he had not been moved 
thereto by any love for me. Every day I realized this 
more and more. No betrayal, no weak moment of tender- 
ness, no longing. A great gulf was between. 

And yet I lived through the two months very comfort- 
ably. The old gayetics seemed to have a fresh zest for 
me. I was brilliant, attractive, and glittering, like an ice- 
peak in the sun of a mid-winter noon. Nothing seemed 
to warm me to touch me with that enkindling spark 
of humanity which brings all souls to a level. So the days 
sped along. 

With the first of December came Aylmer; 

" My darling," he said, " how wonderfully beautiful you 
have grown ! but there's a look about it that almost fright- 
ens one." 

" Do you fancy that I shall melt into a shadow ethe- 
rialize ? " 

"No, not that: the Scotch have a good word for it 
uncanny." 

I laughed. 

" You'll set all Washington to raving about you this 
winter." 

" Well, if I soar too high, you can clip my wings, you 
know." 

" I shall never want to do that, my darling. Believe that 
I shall be proud of all the admiration you win." 

So generous, so delighted in the success of another. 
I tried to make him feel that I appreciated his tenderness. 

Mrs. Lawrence was in her element. I verily believe she 
and Aylmer were much more concerned about the respec- 
tive elegance of silks, laces, and jewels than I. The whole 
thing seemed incongruous to me. That one should care 



 

so much for the adornment of the body, so little for the 
aliment of the soul ! After the excitement was over, what 
then? After one wearied of dresses and revels and idle 
compliments, what could appease this restless, gnawing 
hunger? 

Matters went on to everybody's satisfaction, except that 
it rained continually and kept us indoors. 

" Do you realize the date, and how fast the month is 
going ? " Mrs. Lawrence asked, one morning. 

"Why? Are you counting on the moon to make a 
change in the weather?" and Aylmer yawned. "I verily 
believe the sun has forgotten how to shine?" 

O 

" It is the tenth, and not an invitation directed." 

"There's plenty of time," I said, quickly. 
."None to spare, at least." 

" I wish people could get married without all this foolish 
fuss and talk," I exclaimed, petulantly. 

Aylmer glanced up. " I believe this vile weather affects 
you, too. The first respectable morning we will take a good 
long gallop, and bring ourselves back to serenity." 

" Well," I said, with an effort, " let us amuse ourselves 
counting up our dear five hundred friends." 

With that we adjourned to the library. Aylmer was 
quite out of spirits, more so than I had ever seen him. 
There might be many rainy days to life what then? 

Moralizing over one's wedding cards was not quite the 
thing. 

Presently we all became interested. The lists were gone 
over by each one, all the additions made, and St. John of- 
fered to direct them. Aylrner amused himself writing a 
few, then sauntered up and down the room. A sky of 
hopeless gray, drooping so low that it seemed to envelop 
the tree tops; a drizzling, uncomfortable rain, and a melan- 
choly wail through the distant pines. More than once the 



 

vision of Annt Mildred's death crossed ray mind. How 
strangp that I should think of it now ! 

We lingered over our lunch, we strolled throngh draw- 
ing-room and conservatory, counted the flowers we might 
expect to blossom in time, went to dinner without any 
appetites, dawdled through the dessert, and at last lights 
were brought in. 

" What a musty old hermit St. John is!" Ayhncr said, 
pettishly. " If he had not gone off to his den, we might 
have had a game of whist." 

"I will send for him," Mrs. Lawrence rejoined. 

"No, don't; his high mightiness would only feel bored. 
Commend me to a city in rainy weather, say I. Sydnie, 
suppose you sing." 

I went to the piano, mistrusting my voice, but I deter- 
mined to make the effort. It was a failure, and he ner- 
vously critical on this evening. 

" You are dreadfully out of tune," he commented, pres- 
ently. 

I rose angrily : my first impulse was to leave the room ; 
then I reconsidered, and crossed over to the sofa. What a 
handsome face this was, thrown into clear relief by the 
crimson pillow! An exterior merely : the soul was narrow, 
dark, ill-governed, with no resources in itself. Could I 
minister to it, could I endure it for years and years? 

" How dull you are to night." 

This time I was wounded. I stood irresolute, every pulse 
within me mutinous, and rising to a white heat. 

"My darling," he said, with sudden softness, and drew 
me to a seat beside him. "When we get to Washington 
we shall be as gay as larks. I only wish Christmas came 
sooner." 

The fondness had lost its flavor. Kisses were weak and 
insipid. There were no true and fervent depths in him to 




be roused by love. All that I had been trying to make 
myself believe vanished in an instant and left a hideous 
blank. Already we had come to the dregs. In time, 
when utterly weaned with his vapidness and trifles, I 
might even hate him. I shivered at the thought. 

" You're not well," he said. " This miserable weather 
has given you a cold. Isabelle, I can't have her looking 
like a fright on her wedding day." 

" Never fear," I answered, bravely, and with a touch of 
scorn. 

" I think it would be as sensible to retire as sitting up 
here playing stupid," Mrs. Lawrence remarked ; and we 
accordingly dispersed. 

I went to my own room, and in a burst of passionate 
emotion buried my face in the pillow of the lounge. The 
wild wind blew tempestuous gusts of rain against the win- 
dows, and then moaned off down to the hollows with a 
desolate wail. I pressed my hands to my burning, throb- 
bing temples. Not a tear came, but a long, hysteric sob 
tore its way up from my very soul. 

Circumstances had betrayed me into this engagement, 
but must I go on and consummate my misery? Was there 
no strong hand to snatch me from this fateful destiny? 
Did I dare pray to God? 

O, I had trifled so with life, with myself! I had per- 
verted the holiest desires of my woman's heart, stooped to 
gather shining sand that the next wave might wasli away. 
With great capacities for happiness I had wrought evil 
only, and now I was whirled helplessly along the great 
stream of life, no one caring for the wreck. The time 
foretold by my one best fiiend had come upon me, and I 
was overwhelmed. 

Something rose above the storm without and within. 
My tense nerves caught the sound a low, sweet strain, 



 

Buch as a summer wind sings in the lap of greenest mead- 
ows ; flower wreaths shaking out faintest perfumes, mur- 
murous leaves touched by a soft south wind. Then it 
grew stronger, firmer, as if animated by a living soul a 
child in careless play, rambling over mountain wilds, prodi- 
gal of youth and all that youth holds dear; gay, joyous, 
soaring on the wings of fancy, quivering with every breath, 
easily moved alike to joy or tears. 

I forgot the storm and my own misery. I raised my 
face and listened with absorbing interest. 

Girded with the fearlessness of youth that has courage 
for all things, it went gayly onward. By-ways enticed it, 
mountain tops glittering with brightness hurried it, beguil- 
ing voices of sirens sang their tender songs, and then the 
real struggle began. The storm, the strange melody, the 
war in my own heart how it thrilled me with contend- 
ing emotions ! 

There was a lull in the tempest of passion. I heard the 
calm, sweet voice of the earlier days imploring, then the 
din and wrangle of bitter strife a strange, awesome wail 
as of a soul in peril. Who would gain in -tins mighty 
battle ? 

The gentle voice returned. It was Peace crowned as a 
victor. The storm of passion died away, and in its place 
lingered a sweet, ineffable calm. 

Was that solemn chant of life prophetic? I was kneel- 
ing in the brooding silence with clasped hands and tearful 
eyes. Could I yet be saved ? 



There was a sky of azure and a golden sun the next 
morning. I felt faint, as one who has kept too long a 
vigil, and yet I lay in a hush of dreamy contentment, as 
 





if the crisis of ray life had passed, and my heart, like the 
dove of old, had found rest. Had I the courage to put my 
latent resolve into execution ? 

I dressed slowly, and went down stairs. The letters 
detained by the storm of the preceding day had just 
arrived. 

" I intended to see you before you went," Mrs. Law- 
rence was saying to the servant. " There is a great pack- 
age of mail matter that must be sent immediately." 

While she was speaking, Aylmer started towards me, 
nodding gayly, his face wreathed in sweetest smiles. My 
heart wavered so that its beating became audible. Could 
I give him a traitorous glance, promising hope ? 

He paused and took up a letter, breaking the seal hasti- 
ly. A quick cry passed his lips. 

"What?" Mrs. Lawrence was startled by the ashen 
brow. 

"My father! Dead! Merciful heavens!" 

Mr. St. John joined the group. There was no mistaking 
his solicitude. 

"Dead!" Mrs. Lawrence repeated, raising her eyes in 
consternation. 

He handed the note to St. John a hasty telegram that 
made known only the merest facts. 

"I must go immediately, you see;" and Aylmer's voice 
had a strange wandering sound. " The first train." Then 
he came around to me. 

"These festivities must be delayed," I said, in a low 
tone. 

" A bad omen ; " and he smiled faintly. 

" No matter now." 

u It is best. No one would want a wedding at such a 
gloomy time. And then, everything will have to be 
changed." 



 

"Yes." 

" My darling, this is most unfortunate." 

"I am inexpressibly shocked," Mrs. Lawrence said. 
"You have our warmest sympathies, Aylmer;" and she 
clasped his hand. 

" I will write soon and let you know " 

" We had better give up our present arrangements," I 
remarked, decisively. "You can tell nothing surely as 
yet." 

Mr. St. John's eyes met mine with a glance that thrilled 
and terrified. 

" You have been saved," it said plainly, and I am sure 
mine answered, even at the risk of betraying all that was 
in my soul. 

It was a melancholy breakfast, and the parting was sad 
enough. Something in Aylmer's clinging love touched 
me inexpressibly. Had I misjudged him the night before? 

"Could anything have been more unfortunate?" be- 
wailed Mrs. Lawrence, as she ordered the elegant dresses 
to be folded away. "I think with Aylmer, that it is an 
unlucky omen ; but I hope it will end rightly." 

" It will ; rest assured of that," I said, confidently. 

I was glad to get every reminder out of my sight. 
There was the wraith-like veil and orange blossoms 
would they ever be needed? 

Aylmer wrote as soon as he reached home. His father 
had been ill only a few days, not considered at all danger- 
ous until within an hour or two of his death. He found 
his step-mother plunged into the deepest grief. Her sis- 
ter, Miss Raynor, was with her at the lime. I remembered 
her as one of the Newport belles mentioned by Philip. 

The Christmas that was to have been my wedding day 
we spent very quietly. Another change had come over 
Mr. St. John. Instead of shunning me, he seemed to seek 



 

my society, escort me out, evinced iriiieli interest in my 
comfort, and was uniformly gentle. 

How many events had crowded themselves into the 
brief space of a year! I hardly appeared to myself the 
same person. And now the sense of coming freedom gave 
me a singular buoyancy. How it was to be brought about 
I hardly knew, but it was a sure hope to my hitherto bur- 
dened heart. 

In the evening, Mr. St. John seated himself at the organ 
and played Milton's grand old Hymn of the Nativity. 

"Will you try it?" he asked, presently ; and I sang, 
blending my voice with his full, deep tones. There was a 
light directly in front of the organ, but the far corners of 
the r(Jom were in a dim, twilight shade. The grand, swell- 
ing melody roused all the worship of my nature. I felt as 
if I could have listened and sung forever. 

" How the music stirs you," he said, in a soft, pleased 
voice. 

I thought of another night, and a most peculiar ex- 
perience. 

"This appeals to me in a powerful manner," I an- 
swered. 

The eyes, charged with luminous light, were turned full 
upon me. 

" You played one night some time ago " and I paused. 

"Yes. You liked it?" 

" I cannot tell you how it moved me. It seemed the 
struggle of a human soul." 

" It was. A soul in bondage freeing itself." 

He uttered the words slowly. All the fascination he 
had ever possessed for me returned with renewed force. 
Something within me confessed the man my master. 

He rose and faced me as if he would have spoken, then 
took two or three turns across the room. 



 

"I wonder if any human soul is strong enough to force 
its way out to the light?" he asked, abruptly. 

" I think it is," I made answer. 

From that night I date a new life, as it were. I began 
to see my mistakes more clearly. Pride and self-love had 
led me far astray, and I had many tortuous paths to re- 
trace. How little advancement I had made in any path 
of usefulness ! 

I experienced many misgivings concerning Aylmer. 
For a few weeks his letters were frequent and extrava- 
gantly fond. I answered them in a spirit of tenderest 
sympathy, because just then coldness would have seemed 
cruel, but I purposely refrained from positive declarations 
of affection. I confess to a little pang when I found they 
passed unremarked. No woman likes to own herself so 
poor in power over a lover's heart that the withdrawal of 
tenderness is no longer capable of giving pain. He ap- 
peared to be much engrossed with his step-mother and 
the business, which was rather complicated. He even 
ceased to make excuses about the visit, and no longer 
referred to the marriage. 

I lacked the courage for an overt act. It was so diffi- 
cult to make issue with him. I fancied that when we met 
it could be more easily done. Perhaps, too, I was afraid 
that Ayluicr would prefer an appeal to his cousins, and 
drag me into a painful explanation, so I waited in wretched 
indecision, resolved upon one thing only that I would 
not become Aylmer Channing's wife. 

\Ve were less gay than usual, as Mrs. Lawrence was 
indisposed for several weeks, yet the time passed very 
pleasantly, and ere I was hardly aware spring dawned 
upon us. 

One day I was startled by a letter from Mrs. Otis, so 
different was it from her usual epistles. I thought they 



 

all had a strained and wearied air, as if she was striving 
for peace continually, and yet failed to attain that high 
satisfaction. But this was bright, sunny, and hopeful. 
She asked me to come and help her keep a new and better 
wedding-day on the anniversary of the old. The whole 
current of her life had changed. 

Another sentence held me in a strange, cold grasp. It 
was this : " Is it selfish, dear, to rejoice that your engage- 
ment is broken ? I seem to understand a woman's needs 
so much better than I did a year ago, that I feel now, bril- 
liant and fascinating as Aylmer Channing is, he could never 
render any true, loving, and loyal woman permanently 
happy. To come to the dregs when one has expected a 
draught of clear, rich wine, would be terrible." 

I had announced to her that the marringe was delayed ; 
since then neither of us had mentioned it. She must have 
learned this from some other source, and in a moment I 
was all anxiety to know the truth. So I proposed a brief 
visit, in which Mrs. Lawrence acquiesced, but Mr. St. John 
was instantly annoyed. 

" How easily you tire of Laurel wood," he said, captiously. 
" Women can never be satisfied unless they are in the
