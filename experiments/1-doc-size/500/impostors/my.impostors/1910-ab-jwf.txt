She drags that disgraceful gown out of a trunk where she 's 
had it stowed, nobody knows why, and she 's happier in it 
than she 's been all these months that Celia and I 've been 
working on her." 

" That 's a good dress," said Winterbourne, still chuck- 
ling at the lament for the lost dust-pan. " There 's nothing 
the matter with that dress." 

" I tell you she 's returned to type." 

" Well, where 's Celia? Has she returned to type, too?" 

A look of satisfaction lighted her. 

'' Celia is at the desk in the west room, the only clear spot 
she can find. She 's arranging the circular we mean to send 
round to women's clubs about Lilian." 

"Who's Lilian?" 

They had walked through into the dining-room, and now 
she turned and looked at him as if she found him daft. 

" Lilian ? why, Lilian is Celia's sister. You 've just been 
talking to her." 

" No, I have n't," said Winterbourne. " I 've been talk- 
ing to Bess Hartwell, plain, pretty Bess Hartwell. I adore 
her already. And look at her ! " 

The dining-room was in the main part of the square house 
and the kitchen extending from it, at right angles, had two 
windows and a door, commanded by the one back dining- 



 





room window. While they looked, Bess was about lifting 
one of the kitchen windows by its lower sash. Her broom 
leaned against the wall. She now mounted an old chair that 
had been sitting in the shed, and stepped from it lightly 
through the window. Winterbourne looked at his wife, and 
drew a breath. 

" That girl," said he, "has gone into the arena. She 's a 
Christian martyr." 

" Well," said Catherine practically, " now she can open 
the door. Go and try it, and if she hasn't unfastened it al- 
ready, call to her." 

Winterbourne put a restraining hand on her arm. His 
face worked, but his tone was all solemnity. 

" No, Catherine. You come with me. I'll show you prints 
of Tristram Shandy I found in the attic, or I'll repeat 
poetry to you. I 've been learning it for the Jellybys. But 
you. can't interfere between the lioness and the martyr. I 
won't have it." 

He took her by the arm, and she had to go back into the 
sitting-room where there was a fire on a clean hearth. Win- 
terbourne looked about him suddenly. The room had a 
colder air, yet it was pleasant, too. He had never seen the 
tiles of the hearth glow more ruddily. Suspicion fell upon 
him. 

" Has she been sweeping here ? " he asked. 

Catherine had disposed herself prettily in Lovell's arm- 
chair, and now put out her foot to the blaze. 

" I dare say," she returned, with a studied negation. 

Winterbourne, laying on a stick, smiled broadly. 

" I believe she has," he said to himself. " What a little 
devil for brooms and dust-pans 1 " 

Bess, one foot in the kitchen, stayed poised for a moment 
and looked about her. The kitchen itself, in its mellow 



 





tints and the suggestiveness of comfortable uses, pleased 
hen She saw a dozen things that could be done for its bet- 
tering, either in cleanliness or convenience; but her eye 
could not stay for that. It sought out the bent old figure in 
the chair by the hearth, and her feet took her to it. Lyddy 
looked the picture of inconsolable and silent grief She had 
done none of her tasks. The fire had gone down, and her 
dishes, for lack of hot water, were unwashed. She felt her- 
self inundated and almost drowned by the influx of new 
things, and the cruelty of it, now she was so near death, was 
overwhelming to her. Bess halted by her chair. There was 
indignation and ruth in her pink face. She looked down at 
the gaunt calico-covered shoulder and forbore to touch it. 

" We 're not going to stay," said she. 

Lyddy gave no sign of hearing. 

" She wouldn't stay for a thousand dollars,'' the young 
voice went on. Lyddy knew unerringly that she meant 
Catherine. "You couldn't hire her to." 

The homely speech meant something to Lyddy. She 
gave a little grunt and a lurch in her chair. 

" You needn't do anything for us," the girl continued, 
her keen glance ready to note every responsive change in 
the bowed figure. " You can cook for him. I couldn't suit 
him. You know all his ways." She paused an instant for 
that shaft to strike. " I'll cook for them, his wife and Celia. 
You let me. I'll clear up everything I get round. You 
needn't open the kitchen door if you don't want to. I'll 
take things out through the window." 

" Don't be a fool," said Lyddy. 

Bess felt encouragement. 

" Truly you need n't," she averred. " What 's the use of 
having folks round underfoot in the kitchen ? You let me 
blaze up the fire. Come ! " 



 



Lyddy turned her eyes, almost lost in their map of wrin- 
kles, up to her and looked her slowly over. The eyes trav- 
elled from her face down the brown shoulder to the round, 
strong arm. Then they went back to the face again. 

" You some o' their help ? " she asked. 

" I 've been help all my life, here and there," said Bess. 
" I 'm going to put in some wood." 

She did it with a practised hand while Lyddy watched 
her. Not a movement, as the old woman saw, went amiss- 
While the water heated, the new maid piled dishes and 
washed off the kitchen table, Lyddy, vaguely soothed by 
the accustomed sound of the fire, got up, after a while, and 
herself put in a stick. 

« I'll do that," she said. 

Bess was lifting the cloth over the rising bread, with a 
wise finger-poke to test the lightness. Immediately she left 
it, and while she washed dishes Lyddy moulded bread. 

" What is there for dinner? " asked the girl at length. " I 
could make 'em an omelet." 

Lyddy answered gruffly, — 

" I can make it myself. You can go into t' other part 
Kow. The table-cloths are in the press in the back entry." 

"I'll set the table when it's time," Bess told her gravely. 

She unbolted the door into the dining-room and left 
Lyddy to her tasks. 

Winterbourne and his wife were still before the fire, she 
talking earnestly and he holding Lovell's book in his 
hand and remembering he must get it to him lest Lovell, 
who would never venture into this vortex, should miss it 
sorely. Bess made her declaration briefly and with great 
simplicity. 

" She doesn't want anybody in the kitchen," she an- 
nounced to Winterbourne. 



 


"No" He nodded in a grave concurrence. "That's fair 
enough." 

His wife took up the case, with her conclusive air of mas- 
tership. 

" Not want anybody in the kitchen ? You 've just been in 
yourself, Lilian?" 

" I 've been helping," said the girl. " She won't mind me. 
I 'm her kind." 

Mrs. Winterbourne turned to her husband. 

"John," said she, "how long is this going to last?" 

He was wondering, knowing that it would last as long as 
the invaders chose. But he answered temperately, with a 
knowledge of her side of it and also a concern over it, — 

"You give Lyddy her head. It isn't much to ask, this 
going into the kitchen, now is it ? What do you want to go 
into the kitchen for ? " 

"Lilian," said Mrs. Winterbourne, "will you put on a 
decent dress and come in here and sit down ? " 

The girl looked at her with eyes beseeching pardon. 

" I can't," she said. " I 've got to help get dinner." 

Then she disappeared and they heard the opening and 
shutting of drawers in the back hall where she was examin- 
ing the stores of linen. 

Winterbourne talked hard and consecutively in the next 
hour, to keep his wife's attention in channels sufficiently 
remote from kitchen sieges. Perhaps he told her things he 
might otherwise have kept hidden. For instance, he said 
he must go down to Jim Lovell's that afternoon and carry 
his Theocritus. 

" I remember Mr. Lovell perfectly," his wife responded. 
" He wrote poetry. Does he write any now ? " 

There was that terrifying gleam in her eye, the responsive 
spark in the modern woman at the mention of accomplish- 



 


ment. Winterbourne had forgotten some things about her. 
Once he would have known that the proximity of a poet 
meant the pursuit of him for the illegitimate purposes of 
autographs and teas. Yet he answered her unguardedly, — 

"He writes some, I believe. Jim doesn't publish. He's 
the one creature I know that's living his own life." 

"Doesn't publish? Why not? Is he too timid?" 

" Yes, I guess Jim 's timid — before certain things." 

"He ought to be pushed. He ought to have somebody 
to push him." 

"Oh, no, he oughtn't. If you pushed him, you'd push 
him into an abyss, the one where all the asses are struggling 
for notoriety. Why, see here I " In his vindication of Lovell 
he forgot his caution toward her. She seemed to be a certain 
part of the eager world judging a man who was not of its kind. 
" Lovell had some money left him, a couple of years ago. 
It was a good warm lump. To-day there isn't a sign of his 
having it. He lives in his little garden house — " 

" Garden house ? What 's that ? " 

" It 's a little house built for the help when his grand- 
fiither was bringing up his eight children and wanted the 
big house for them. Jim lets the big house stand idle, and 
Mary Manahan helps him do his work in the little one." 

"Shocking!" 

" No, it isn't shocking, Catherine. He isn't like me. I 
collect dirt and I sit down and thrive in it. Lovell 's as neat 
as a bee, in the cleanest unpopulated hive you ever saw. 
What's all this nonsense about women's housekeeping? 
That isn't a sacred trust. A man can keep house as well as 
a woman. Some of 'em do. Lovell does." 

She was not heeding him. The moment he touched upon 
abstract defence of the housekeeping male she was off on 
more personal considerations of her own. 



 





" But where is the money ? " she mused. 

He looked at her frowning at the irrelevance of her curi- 
osity. 

" Money? I don't know."

" The money that was left him." 

" That isn't the point. The point is that Lovell didn't 
use it to bathe in as some of them do and wash away all his 
natural qualities. He stayed unchanged, just as he was when 
he was teaching the academy here and writing verses. That's 
what I 'm trying to tell you." 

" Do you suppose he gave it away ? " 

Winterbourne took his chair-arms in a mighty grip and 
seemed to lift himself and the chair with him by a kind of 
inner convulsion. 

"Jupiter, Saturn, the Earth and Mars ! Don't I tell you 
I don't know? Don't I tell you it's not my business or 
yours either?" 

" Is he of a philanthropic disposition? Is he interested in 
the arts ? " 

Winterbourne relaxed his grasp and seemed, by an effort, 
to bind himself to the chair. Now his only thought was of 
protecting Lovell's inner mind from the assaults of a tele- 
pathic curiosity. Lovell's solitude was so precious to him 
that he could never fancy putting a question to disturb it ; 
even a fantastic care had to be observed where an outer 
world threatened to break in. It was impossible to classify 
his friend because if he denied him one set of qualities she 
was sure to trip him on that side. 

" Lovell hasn't any disposition at all," he said, out of his 
fervor of discretion. "He's neither charitable nor unchar- 
itable. You know what Lyddy said about the soap-grease 
man. She said he hadn't a trait in his character. That 's Jim 
Lovell." 



 





" You don't mean your friend has been a soap-grease man ? " 

Winterbourne ground his teeth at her and gripped at the 
chair-arms again. 

" I am embroidering my talk with pearls of rhetoric," he 
said. " I am borrowing from Lyddy to describe Lovell the 
more graphically. I tell you he hasn't a trait in his char- 
acter." 

" Is he as negative as that ? " 

Winterbourne rumbled a laugh and gazed piously at the 
fire. 

" That 's Lovell," said he. 

" How could he be a poet ? " 

" Well, maybe Jim isn't so very much of a poet." 

" I must make a point of meeting him." 

Winterbourne turned upon her. 

" No, you won't, Catherine. I don't let Jim in for that." 

" Do you mean you don't want me to meet your friends ? " 

" Not Lovell. Besides, you can't. There 's something the 
matter with him." 

"What is it?" 

Winterbourne considered whether Lovell's unique and 
roundabout precaution to avoid social feats would do here, 
in the face of such an eager huntress. Was it enough to be 
deaf? She would ask if he had learned the lip language and 
volunteer teaching it to him. 

" He isn't seeing people, that's all," he hammered obsti- 
nately. "Jim's not up to it." 

" He's not tubercular?" 

" Lord 1 " Now he could only groan. 

"In that case I should feel very seriously about his meet- 
ing the girls." 

"Jim isn't going to meet the girls, or any girls. It's pre- 
cisely what I told you." 



 





"I believe he's tubercular. Does he take the open-air 
treatment?" 

At that instant, with the swish and rustle of the silk Win- 
terbourne hated, but which he welcomed now for a diversion, 
Celia came in from the next room. She had pencil and paper 
in hand, and she perched herself on the arm of his chair and 
displayed the sheets to him. 

" Papa," said she, in the cosiest way, " you know all about 
punctuation and proof-reading and things, don't you? " 

''Papa" was an innovation. She had been taught to say 
" father " soberly, and although it wore for him an ironic 
flavor he did not really mind. But the diminutive made him 
wriggle mentally and wish the feminine did not have to ex- 
press itself in mosaic. She was ofiering him the sheets more 
definitely. 

" These are Lilian's songs, her little repertory. I 'm mak- 
ing out an announcement for clubs. What do you think ? " 

Winterbourne fumbled for his eyeglasses, and she found 
them for him, with odious quickness, pounced delicately, and 
seemed about to set them on his nose. But their clouded 
state struck her, and she made a pretty face. 

" I 'm going to rub them I" she announced, with a bright 
suggestion of usefulness that made him wince. He saw it go- 
ing further and further, into his desk even, and ordering his 
papers about. She was breathing on the glasses in a charming 
hurry, and now she rubbed them with her little handkerchief. 
" There ! " she said. 

Winterbourne felt that he really couldn't endure it if she 
put them on his nose, and took them from her. He accepted 
the sheet of paper and looked at it. 

" ' Batti! batti ! ' Really ? Does that child know Italian ? " 

" Oh, no, only enough to sing. She learns her songs, you 
know." 



 





" Oh ! " He scanned it again, frowning, and gave it back 
to her. " Yes," he said, " your words are all right. But it 
seems to me a poor slatternly way to do." 

"What, papa?" 

" To learn like a parrot and sing what you don't know 
the meaning of." 

" But she does, in a way. She's been taught the — why, 
the kind of emotion that goes with them, and it's perfectly 
easy to put it in. It ought to be easy, I should say," she 
added as a wondering afterthought, remembering how im- 
possible her sister found it to warm at call. 

If Celia had had the voice, she knew she would by this 
time have had also money and a name. It was bitter to her 
that her sister showed no sign of earning either. She wanted 
them for Lilian who did not crave them for herself, and, it 
sometimes seemed, wilfully forbore to work for them. 

"It's bad business," Winterbourne was saying, "cheap, 
miserable business jockeying with a language when you 
haven't learned to respect it." 

" Isn't that interesting, papa ? " she recalled herself from 
her musings to say brightly. " It's so quaint." 

Winterbourne thought over that in a puzzled helplessness. 
He had never been in the set where she had moved at inter- 
vals, chiefly in travelling, and no one had told him that a 
part of the modern game of smartness lies in the using of 
words outside their natal meaning. He was to learn that Celia, 
with a steadfast will, conformed seriously, even in little ways, 
to what the world thought prettiest. It was always, now, for 
Lilian. Often she got quite tired of fitting herself to dull
