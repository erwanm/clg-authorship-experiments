him was, Ellen never dreamed how much deeper it would 
have been, but for the little figure flitting round and filling 
up the vacancy ; how much he reposed on the gentle look 
of affection, the pleasant voice, the watchful thoughtfulness 
that never left anything undone that she could do for his 
pleasure. Perhaps he did not know it himself. She was 
not sure he even noticed many of the little things she daily 
did or tried to do for him. Always silent and reserved, he 
was more so now than ever ; she saw him little, and very seldom long at a time, unless when they were riding to church together ; he was always in his study or abroad. But the 
trifles she thought he did not see were noted and registered, 
and repaid with all the affection he had to give. 

As for Mr. John, it never came into Ellen's head to think 
whether she was a comfort to him ; he was a comfort to her ; 
she looked at it in quite another point of view. He had gone 
to his old sleeping room up-stairs, which Margery had settled 
with herself he would make his study ; and for that he had 
taken the sitting-room. This vras Ellen's study too, so she 
was constantly with him ; and of the quietest she thought her 
movements would have to be. 

" What are you stepping so softly for ?" said he one day, 
catching her hand as she was passing near him. 

" You were busy — I thought you were busy," said Ellen. 

" And what then ?" 

" I was afraid of disturbing you." 

" You never disturb me," said he ; — " you need not fear 
it. Step as you please, and do not shut the doors carefully. 
I see you and hear you ; but witliout any disturbance." 

Ellen found it was so. But she was an exception to the 
general rule ; other people disturbed him, as she had one or 
two occasions of knowing. 







Of one thing she was perfectly sure, whatever he might be 
doing, — that he saw and heard her ; and equally sui-e that if 
anything were not right she should sooner or later hear of it. 
But this was a censorship Ellen rather loved than feared. In 
the first place, she was never misunderstood ; in the second, 
however ironical and severe he might be to others, and Ellen 
knew he could be both when there was occasion, he never 
was either to her. With great plainness always, but with an 
equally happy choice of time and manner, he either said or 
looked what he wished her to understand. This happened 
indeed only about comparative trifles ; to have seriously displeased him, Ellen would have thought the last great evil 
that could fall upon her in this world. 

One day Margery came into the room with a paper in her 
hand. 

Miss Ellen," said she in a low tone, — " here is Anthony 
Fox a^ain — he has brougfht another of his curious letters that 
he wants to know if Miss Ellen will be so good as to write 
out for him once more. He says he is ashamed to trouble 
you so much." 

Ellen was reading, comfortably ensconsed in the corner of 
the wide sofa. She gave a glance, a most ungratified one, at 
the very original document in Margery's hand. Unpromising it certainly looked. 

" Another ! Dear me ! — I wonder if there isn't somebody 
else he could get to do it for him, Margery ? I think I have 
had my share. You don't know what a piece of work it is, 
to copy out one of those scrawls. It takes me ever so long 
in the first place to find what he has written, and then to put 
it so that any one else can make sense of it — I've got about 
enough of it. Don't you suppose he could find plenty of 
other people to do it for him ?" 

" I don't know. Miss Ellen, — I suppose he could." 

" Then ask him, do ; won't you, Margery ? I'm so tired 
of it ! and this is the third one ; and I've got something else 
to do. Ask him if there isn't somebody else he can get to 
do it ; — if there isn't, I will ; — tell him I am busy." 

Margery withdrew and Ellen buried herself again in her 
book, Anthony Fox was a poor Irishman, whose uncouth 
attempts at a letter Ellen had once offered to write out and 
make straight for him, upon hearing Margery tell of hia 








lamenting that he could not make one fit to sond home to hia 
mother. 

Presently Margery came in again, stopping this time at the 
table which Mr. John had pushed to the far side of the room 
to get away from the fire. 

" I beg your pardon, sir," she said, — " I am ashamed to be so 
troublesome, — but tliis Irish body, this Anthony Fox, has 
begged me, and I didn't know how to refuse him, to come in 
and ask for a sheet of paper and a pen for him, sir, — he wants 
to copy a letter, — if Mr. Jolm would be so good ; a quill pen, 
sir, if you please ; he cannot write with any other." 

" No," said John coolly. " Ellen will do it." 

Margery looked in some doubt from the table to the sofa, 
but Ellen instantly rose up and with a burning cheek came 
forward and took the paper from the hand wliere Margery 
still held it. 

Ask him to wait a little while, Marger}^" she said hurriedly, — " I'll do it as soon as I can, — tell him in half an hour." 

It was not a very easy nor quick job. Ellen worked at it 
patiently, and finished it well by the end of the half hour ; 
though with a burning cheek still; and a dimness over her 
eyes frequently obliged her to stop till she could clear them. 
It was done, and she carried it out to the kitchen herself. 

The poor man's thanks were very warm ; but that was not 
what Ellen wanted. She could not rest till she had got another word from her broth ei". lie was busy ; she dared not 
speak to him ; she sat fidgeting and uneasy in the corner of 
the sofa till it was time to get ready foi- riding. She had 
plenty of time to make up her mind about the right and the 
wrong of her own conduct. 

During the ride lie was just as usual, and she began to 
think he did not mean to say anything more on the matter. 
Pleasant talk and pleasant exercise had almost driven it out 
of her head, wien as they were walking their horses over a 
level plnce, he suddenly began. 

" By-the-by, you are too busy, Ellie," said he. " Which 
of your studies shall we cut off?" 

" Please, Mr. John," said Ellen blushing, — " don't say 
anything about that! I was not studying at all — I was just 
amusing myself with a book — I was only selfish and lazy." 

" Only — I would rather you were too busy, Ellie." 







Ellen's eyes filled. 

" I was wrong," she said, — " I knew it at the time, — at 
least as soon as you spoke I knew it ; and a little before ; — 
I was very wrong !" 

And his keen eye saw that the confession was not out of 
compliment to him merely ; it came from the heart. 

" You are right now," he said smiling. " But how are 
your reins ? 

Ellen's heart was at rest again. 

"I forgot them," said she gayly, — " I was thinking of 
something else." 

" You must not talk when you are riding, unless you can 
contrive to manage two things at once ; and no more lose 
command of your horse than you would of yourself." 

Ellen's eye met his with all the contrition, affection, and 
ingenuousness that even he wished to see there ; and they put 
their horses to the canter. 

This winter was in many ways a very precious one to 
Ellen. French gave her now no trouble ; she was a clever 
arithmetician ; she knew geography admirably, and was tolerably at home in both English and American history ; the 
way was .cleared for the course of improvement in which her 
brother's hand led and helped her. He put her into Latin ; 
carried on the study of natural philosophy they had begun 
the year before, and which with his instructions was perfectly delightful to Ellen ; he gave her some works of stronger 
reading than she had yet tried, besides histories in French 
and English, and higher branches of arithmetic. These 
things were not crowded together so as to fatigue, nor hurried through so as to overload. Carefully and thoroughly 
fihe was obliged to put her mind through every subject they 
wintered upon ; and just at that age, opening as her understanding was, it grappled eagerly with all that he gave her, 
as well from love to learning as from love to him. In reading too, she began to take new and strong delight. Especially two or three new English periodicals, which John sent for 
on purpose for her, were mines of pleasure to Ellen. There 
was no fiction in them either ; they were as full of instruction 
as of interest. At all times of the day and night, in her intervals of business, Ellen might be seen with one of these on a 
ber hand ; nestled among the cushions of the sofa, or on a little 







bench by the side of the fireplace in the twilight, where she 
could have the benefit of the blaze, which she loved to read 
by as well as ever. Sorrowful remembrances were then 
flown, all things present were out of view, and Ellen's face 
was dreamingly happy. 

It was well there was always somebody by, who whatever 
he might himself be doing, never lost sight of her. If ever 
Ellen was in danger of bending too long over her studies or 
indulging herself too much in the sofa-corner, she was sure 
to be broken off to take an hour or two of smart exercise, 
riding or walking, or to recite some lesson, (and their recitations were very lively things) or to read aloud, or to talk. 
Sometimes if he saw that she seemed to be drooping or a 
ittle sad, he would come and sit down by her side or call 
her to his, find out what she was thinking about ; and then, 
instead of slurring it over, talk of it fairly and set it before 
her in such a light that it was impossible to think of it again 
gloomily, for that day at least. Sometimes he took other 
ways ; but never when he was present allowed her long to 
look weary or sorrowful. He often read to her, and every 
day made her read aloud to him. This Ellen disliked very 
much at first, and ended with as much liking it. She had 
an admirable teacher. He taught her how to manao-e her 
voice and how to manage the language ; in both which he 
excelled himself, and was determined that she should ; and 
besides this their reading often led to talking that Ellen delighted in. Alwap when he was making copies for her she 
read to him, and once at any rate in the course of the day. 

Every day when the weather would permit, the Black 
Prince and the Brownie with their respective riders might 
be seen abroad in the country, far and wide. In the course 
of their rides Ellen's horsemanship was diligently perfected. 
Very often their turning place was on the top of the Cat's 
back, and the horses had a rest and Mrs. Vawse a visit before they went down again. They had long walks too, by 
hill and dale ; pleasantly silent or pleasantly talkative, — all 
pleasant to Ellen ! 

Her only lonely or sorrowful time was when John was 
gone to Randolph. It began early Saturday morning, and 
perhaps ended with Sunday night; for all Monday was hope 
and expectation. Even Saturday she had not much time 




to mope ; that was the day for her great week's mending, 
When John was gone and her morning affairs were out of 
the way, Ellen brought out her work basket, and established herself on the sofa for a quiet day's sewing, without the 
least fear of interruption. But sewing did not always hinder 
thinking. And then certainly the room did seem very empty, 
and very still ; and the clock, which she never heard the 
rest of the week, kept ticking an ungracious reminder that 
she was alone. Ellen would sometimes forget it in the intense interest of some nice little piece of repair which must 
be exquisitely done in a wristband or a glove ; and then perhaps Margery would softly open the door and come in. 

" Miss Ellen, dear, you're lonesome enough ; isn't there 
something I can do for you ? I can't rest for thinking of 
your being here all by yourself." 

" never mind Margery," said Ellen smiling, — " I am doing very well. I am living in hopes of Monday. Come and 
look here Margery, — how will that do ? — don't you think I 
am learning to mend ?" 

" It's beautiful, Miss Ellen ! I can't make out how you've 
learned so quick. I'll tell Mr. John some time who does 
these things for him." 

" No, indeed, Margery ! don't you. Please not, Margery. 
I like to do it very much indeed, but I don't want he should 
know it, nor Mr. Humphreys. Now you won't, Margery, will 
you ?" 

" Miss Ellen, dear, I wouldn't do the least little thing as 
would be worrisome to you for the whole world. Aren't you 
tired sitting here all alone ?" 

" sometimes, a little," said Ellen sighing. " I can't help 
that, you know." 

" I feel it even out there in the kitchen," said Margery ; — I feel it lonesome hearing the house so still ; I miss 
the want of Mr. John's step up and down the room. How 
fond he is of walking so, to be sure ! How do you manage. 
Miss Ellen, with him making his study here ? don't you have 
to keep uncommon quiet ?" 

" No," said Ellen, — " no quieter than I like. I do just as 
I have a mind to. 

" I thought, to be sure," said Margery, " he would have 
taken up stairs for his study, or the next ropm, one or t'other ; 







he used to be mighty particular in old times ; he didn't like 
to have anybody found when he was busy ; but I am glad he 
is altered however ; it is better for you, Miss Ellen, dear, 
though I didn't know how you was ever going to make out at 
first.' 

Ellen thought for a minute, when Margery was gone, 
whether it could be that John was putting a force upon his 
hking for her sake, beai ing her presence when he would rather 
have been without it. But she thought of it only a minute ; she 
was sure, when she recollected herself, that however it happened, she was no hindrance to him in any kind of woik ; 
that she went out and came in, and as he had said, he saw 
and heard her without any disturbance. Besides he had said 
so ; and that was enough. 

Saturday evening she generally contrived to busy herself 
in her books. But when Sunday morning came with its calmness and brightness ; when the business of the week was put 
away, and quietness abroad and at home invited to collection, then Ellen's thoughts went back to old times, and then 
she missed the calm sweet face that had agreed so well with 
the day. She missed her in the morning, when the early sun 
streamed in through the empty room. She missed her at the 
breakfast-table, where John was not to take her place. On 
the ride to church, where Mr Humphreys was now her silent 
companion, and every tree in the road and every opening in 
the lanscape seemed to call for Alice to see it with her. Very 
muL-h she missed her in church. The empty seat beside her , 
— the unused hym.n-book on the shelf, — the want of her 
sweet voice in the singing, — oh how it went to Pollen's heart. 
And Mr. Humphreys' grave steadfast look and tone kept it 
in her mind ; she saw it was in his. Those Sunday mornings 
tried Ellen. At first they were bitterly sad ; her tears used 
to flow abundantly whenever they could unseen. Time soft- 
ened this feeling. 

While Mr. Humphreys went on to his second service in the 
village beyond, Ellen stayed at Carra-carra and tried to teach 
a Sunday school. Slie determined as far as she could to sup- 
ply beyond the home circle the loss that was not felt only 
there. She was able however to gather together but her own 
four children whom she had constantly taught from the be- 
ginning, and two others. The rest were scattei-ed. After 




her lunch, which having no companion but Margery was now 
a short one, Ellen went next to the two old women that Alice 
had been accustomed to attend for the purpose of reading, and 
what Ellen called preaching. These poor old people had sadly 
lamented the loss of the faithful friend whose place they never 
expected to see supplied in this world, and whose kindness 
had constantly sweetened their lives with one great pleasure 
a week. Ellen felt afraid to take so much upon herself, as to 
try to do for them what Alice had done ; however she resolved ; and at the very first attempt their gratitude and joy 
far overpaid her for the effort she had made. Practice and the 
motive she had, soon enabled Ellen to remember and repeat 
faithfully the greater part of Mr. Humphreys' morning sermon. Reading the Bible to Mrs. Blockson was easy ; she had 
often done that ; and to repair the loss of Alice's pleasant comments and explanations she bethought her of her Pilgrim's 
Progress. To her delight the old woman heard it greedily, 
and seemed to take great comfort in it ; often referring to 
what Ellen had read before and begging to hear such a piece 
over again. Ellen generally went home pretty thoroughly 
tired, yet feeling happy ; the pleasure of doing good still far 
overbalanced the pains. 

Sunday evening was another lonely time ; Ellen spent it as 
best she could. Sometimes with her Bible and prayer, and 
then she ceased to be lonely ; sometimes with so many plea- 
sant thoughts that had sprung up out of the employments of 
the morning that she could not be sorrowful ; sometimes she 
could not help being both. In any case, she was very apt 
when the darkness fell to take to singing hymns ; and it grew 
to be a habit with Mr. Humphreys when he heard her to come 
out of his study and lie down upon the sofa and listen, suffer- 
ing no light in the room but that of the fire. Ellen never was 
better pleased than when her Sunday evenings were spent 
so. She sung with wonderful pleasure when she sung for 
him ; and she made it her business to fill her memory with all 
the beautiful hymns she ever knew or could find, or that he 
liked particularly. 

With the first opening of her eyes on Monday morning 
came the thought, ''John will be at home to-day!" That 
was enough to carry Ellen pleasantly through whatever the 
day might bring. She genei-ally kept her mending of stockings for Monday morning, because with that thought in her 
head she did not mind anytliing. She had no visits from 
Margery on Monday ; but Ellen sang over her work, sprang 
about with happy energy, and studied her hardest ; for John 
in what he expected her to do made no calculations for work 
of which he knew nothing. He was never at home till late 
in the day ; and when Ellen had done all she had to do and 
set the supper-table with punctilious care, and a face of busy 
happiness it would have been a pleasure to see if there had 
been any one to look at it, she would take what happened to 
be the favorite book and plant herself near the glass door ; 
like a very epicure, to enjoy both the present and the future 
at once. Even then the present often made her forget 
the future ; she would be lost in her book, perhaps hunting 
the elephant in India or fighting Nelson's battles over again, 
and the first news she would have of what she had set her- 
self there to watch for would be the click of the door-lock or 
a tap on the glass, for the horse was almost always left at the 
further door. Back then she came, from India or the Nile ; 
down went the book ; Ellen had no more thouofht but for 
what was before her. 

For the rest of that evening the measure of Ellen's happiness was full. It did not matter whether John were in a 
talkative or a thoughtful mood ; whether he spoke to her and 
looked at her or not ; it was pleasure enough to feel that he 
was there. She was perfectly satisfied merely to sit down 
near him, though she did not get a word by the hour together. 



CHAPTER XLV. 




One Monday evening, John being tired, was resting in the 
corner of the sofa. The silence had lasted a long time. 
Ellen thought so, and standing near, she by-and-by put her 
hand gently into one of his which he was thoughtfully passing through the locks of his hair. Her hand was clasped 
immediately, and quitting his abstracted look he asked what 
she had been doing that day ? Ellen's thoughts went back to 
toes of stockings and a long rent in her dress ; she merely 
answered, smiling, that she had been busy. 

"Too busy I'm afraid. Come round here and sit down. 
What have you been busy about ?" 

Ellen never thought of trying to evade a question of his. 
She colored and hesitated. He did not press it any further. 

" Mr. John," said Ellen, when the silence seemed to have 
set in again, — " there is something I have been wanting to ask 
you this great while," — 

" Why hasn't it been asked this great while ?" 

" I didn't quite like to ; — I didn't know what you would 
say to it." 

" I am sorry I am at all terrible to you, Ellie." 

"Why you are not!" said Ellen laughing, — "how you 
talk ! but I don't much like to ask people things." 

" I don't know about that," said he smiling ; — " my memory 
rather seems to say that you ask things pretty often." 

" Ah yes, — those things, — but I mean — I don't like to ask 
things when ] am not quite sure how people will like it." 

" You are right, certainly, to hesitate when you are doubtful in such a matter ; but it is best not to be doubtful when 
I am concerned." 



" Well," said Ellen, — " I wished very much — I was going 
to ask — if you would have any objection to let me read one 
of your sermons." 

" None in the world, Ellie." said he smiling, — " but they 
have never been written yet 

" Not written !" 

" No — there is all I had to guide me yesterday." 
" A half sheet of paper ! — and only written on one side ! 
— I can make nothing of this. "What is this? — Hebrew ?" 
" Shorthand." 

" And is that all ! I cannot understand it," said Ellen, 
sighing as she gave back the paper, 

" What if you were to go with me next time ? They want 
to see you very much at Ventnor." 

So do I want to see them," said Ellen ; — " very much 
indeed." 

" Mrs. Marshman sent a most earnest request by me that 
you would come to her the next time I go to Randolph," 

Ellen gave the matter a very serious consideration ; if one 
might judge by her face. 

" What do you say to it ?" 
I should like to go — very much," said Ellen slowly, — 
"but"— 

" But you do not think it would be pleasant ?" 
No, no," said Ellen laughing, — " I don't mean that ; but 
I think I would rather not." 
- Why ?" 

" O — I have some reasons." 
You must give me very good ones, or I think I shall
