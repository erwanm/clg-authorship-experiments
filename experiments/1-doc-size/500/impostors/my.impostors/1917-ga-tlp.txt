dirty, malodorous work, and she replied that making 
boutonnieres for gentlemen in a florist-shop was paradise by contrast, but she was only too happy to be 



 

doing as much for France in her way as her brother 
was in his. She added that when the war was over 
she should take off her blue linen apron streaked with 
machine grease once for all, not remain from choice 
as many would. But meanwhile it was not so bad! 
She made ten francs a day. Some of the women received as high as fifteen. Moreover, they bossed the 
few men whose brawn was absolutely indispensable 
and must be retained in the usine at all costs. 

These men took their orders meekly. Perhaps they 
were amused. The French are an ironic race. Perhaps they bided their time. But they never dreamed 
of disobeying those Amazons whose foot the Kaiser 
of all the Boches had placed on their necks.

One of the greatest of these U sines de Guerre is 
at Lyons, in the buildings of the Exposition held 
shortly before the outbreak of the war. I went to 
this important Southern city (a beautiful city, which 
I shall always associate with the scent of locust-blossoms at the suggestion of James Hazen Hyde. He 
gave me a letter to the famous Mayor, M. Herriot, 
who was a member of the last Briand Cabinet. 

M. Herriot was also a Senator, and as he was leaving for Paris a few hours after I presented my letter 
he turned me over to a friend of his wife, Madame 
Castell, a native of Lyons, the daughter of one silk 
 
merchant and the widow of another. This charming 
young woman, who had spent her married life in New 
York, by the way, took me everywhere, and although 
we traversed many vast distances in the Mayor's auto- 
mobile, it seemed to me that I walked as many miles 
in hospitals, factories, ateliers (workrooms for teaching the mutilated new trades), and above all in the 
Usine de Guerre. 

Here not only were thousands of women employed 
but a greater variety of classes. The women of the 
town, unable to follow the army and too plucky to live 
on charity, had been among the first to ask for work. 
The directeur beat his forehead when I asked him how 
they behaved when not actually at the machines, but 
at least they had proved as faithful and skillful as their 
more respectable sisters. 

Lyons was far more crowded and lively than Paris, 
which is so quiet that it calls to mind the lake that 
filled the crater of Mont Pelee before the eruption of 
1902. But this fine city of the South — situated almost 
as beautifully as Paris on both sides of a river — is not 
only a junction, it not only has industries of all sorts 
besides the greatest silk factories in the world, but 
every train these days brings down wounded for its 
many hospitals, and the next train brings the family 
and friends of these men, who, when able to afford 
it, establish themselves in the city for the period of 
convalescence. The restaurants and cafes were always 
crowded and this handsome city on the Rhone was 
almost gay. 



 

There were practically no unemployed. The old 
women of the poor went daily to an empty court-room 
where they sat in the little amphitheater sewing or 
knitting. In countless other ouvroirs they were cutting and making uniforms with the same facility that 
men had long since acquired, or running sleeping bags 
through sewing-machines at the rate of thousands a 
day. M. Herriot "mobilized" Lyons early in the war, 
and its contribution to the needs of the Front has 
been . enormous. 

The reformes (men too badly mutilated to be of 
further use at the front) are being taught many new 
trades in the ateliers : toy-making, wooden shoes with 
leather tops for the trenches, cigarette packages, 
baskets, typewriting, stenography, weaving, repairing. 
In one of the many ateliers I visited with Madame 
Castell I saw a man who had only one arm, and the 
left at that, and only a thumb and little finger remaining of the ten he had taken into war, learning to 
write anew. When I was shown one of his exercises 
I was astounded. He wrote far better than I have 
ever done, and I can recall few handwritings so precise 
and elegant. One may imagine what a man accom- 
plishes who still has a good hand and arm. It was both 
interesting and pathetic to see these men guiding their 
work with their remaining hand and manipulating the 
machinery with the stump of the other arm. Those 
who come out from the battlefields with health intact 
will be no charge to the state, no matter what their 
mutilations. 



 

One poor fellow came in to- the ficole Joffre while 
I was there. He was accompanied by three friends 
of the Mayor's, who hoped that some one of the new 
occupations might suit his case. He was large and 
strong and ruddy and he had no hands. Human ingenuity had not yet evolved far enough for him. He 
was crying quietly as he turned away. But his case 
is by no means hopeless, for when his stumps are no 
longer sensitive he will be fitted with a mechanical 
apparatus that will take the place of the hands he has 
given to France. 

Madame Castell's work is supplying hospitals with 
anything, except food, they may demand, and in this 
she has been regularly helped by the Needlework Guild 
of Pennsylvania. 

Madame Herriot's ouvroir occupies the magnificent 
festal salon of the Hotel de Ville, with its massive 
chandeliers and its memories of a thousand dinners 
and balls of state from the days of Louis XIV down 
to the greatest of its mayors. She supplies French 
prisoners in Germany with the now famous comfort 
packages. Some of them she and her committee put 
up themselves; others are brought in by members of 
the family or the friends of the unfortunate men in 
Germany. The piece de resistance had always been 
a round loaf of bread, but on the day I first visited 
the salon consternation was reigning. Word had 
come from Germany that no more bread nor any sort 
of food stuff should be sent in the packages, and hundreds were being unpacked. Crisp loaves of bread 



 

that would have brought comfort to many a poor soul 
were lying all over the place. 

The secret of the order was that civilian Germans 
were begging bread of the French prisoners, and this, 
of course, was bad for the tenderly nursed German 
morale. 



IV 
MADEMOISELLE JAVAL AND THE ECLOPES 



MLLE. JAVAL, unlike Madame Balli, was not a 
member of the fashionable society of Paris, a 
femme du monde, or a reigning beauty. But in certain 
respects their cases were not dissimilar. Born into one 
of the innumerable sets- wi thin-sets of the upper bourgeoisie, living on inherited wealth, seeing as little as 
possible of the world beyond her immediate circle of 
relatives and friends, as curiously indifferent to it as 
only a haughty French bourgeoisie can be, growing up 
in a large and comfortable home — according to French 
ideas of comfort — governing it, when the duty descended to her shoulders, with all the native and practised economy of the French woman, but until her 
mother's illness without a care, and even then without 
an extra contact, Mile. Javal's life slipped along for 
many years exactly as the lives of a million other 
girls in that entrenched secluded class slipped along 
before the tocsin, ringing throughout the land on 
August 2, 1914, announced that once more the men 
of France must fight to defend the liberty of all classes 
alike. 



 

Between wars the great central mass of the population in France known as the bourgeoisie — who maybe roughly denned as those that belong neither to the 
noblesse at one end nor to the industrials and peasant 
proprietors at the other, but have capital, however 
minute, invested in rentes or business, and who, beginning with the grande bourgeoisie, the haughty 
possessors of great inherited fortunes, continuing 
through the financial and commercial magnates, 
down to the petite bourgeoisie who keep flour- 
ishing little shops, hotels, etc. — live to get the most 
out of life in their narrow, traditional, curiously intensive way. They detest travel, although at least 
once in their lives they visit Switzerland and Italy; 
possibly, but with no such alarming frequency as to 
suggest an invasion, England. 

The most aspiring read the literature of the day, 
see the new plays (leaving the jeune Mle at home), 
take an intelligent interest in the politics of their own 
country, visit the annual salons, and if really advanced 
discuss with all the national animation such violent 
eruptions upon the surface of the delicately poised 
art life, which owes its very being to France, as impressionism, cubism, etc. Except among the very rich, 
where, as elsewhere, temptations are many and pressing, they have few scandals to discuss, but much 
gossip, and there is the ever recurrent flutter over 
births, marriages, deaths. They have no snobbery in 
the climber's sense. When a bourgeois, however 
humble in origin, graduates as an "intellectual" he is 



received with enthusiasm (if his table manners will 
pass muster) by the noblesse; but it is far more difficult for a nobleman to enter the house of a bourgeois. 
It is seldom that he wants to, but sometimes there ' 
are sound financial reasons for forming this almost 
illegitimate connection, and then his motives are penetrated by the keen French mind — a mind born without illusions — and interest alone dictates the issue. 
The only climbers in our sense are the wives of politicians suddenly risen to eminence, and even then the 
social ambitions of these ladies are generally confined to arriving in the exclusive circles of the haute 
bourgeoisie. 

The bourgeoisie are as proud of their class as the 
noblesse of theirs, and its top stratum regards itself 
as the real aristocracy of the Republique Franchise, 
the families bearing ancient titles as anachronistic; 
although oddly enough they and the ancient noblesse 
are quite harmonious in their opinion of the Napoleonic 
aristocracy! One of the leaders in the grande bourgeoisie wrote me at a critical moment in the affairs of 
Greece: "It looks as if Briand would succeed in 
placing the lovely Princess George of Greece on the 
throne, and assuredly it is better for France to have a 
Bonaparte there than no one at all !" 

It is only when war comes and the men and women 
of the noblesse rise to the call of their country as 
automatically as a reservist answers the tocsin or the 
printed order of mobilization, that the bourgeoisie is 
forced to concede that there is a tremendous power 



 

still resident in the prestige, organizing ability, social 
influence, tireless energy, and self-sacrifice of the disdained aristocracy. 

During the war ceuvres have been formed on so 
vast a scale that one sees on many committee lists the 
names of noblesse and bourgeois side by side. But 
it is a defensive alliance, bred of the stupendous necessities of war, and wherever possible each prefers to 
work without the assistance of the other. The French 
Army is the most democratic in the world. French 
society has no conception of the word, and neither 
noblesse nor bourgeoisie has the faintest intention of 
taking it up as a study. There is no active antagonism 
between the two classes — save, to be sure, when individual members show their irreconcilable peculiarities 
at committee meetings — merely a profound indifference. 

II 

Mile. Javal, although living the usual restricted life 
before the war, and far removed from that section of 
her class that had begun to astonish Paris by an un- 
precedented surrender to the extravagancies in public 
which seemed to obsess the world before Europe abruptly returned to its normal historic condition of 
warfare, was as highly educated, as conversant with 
the affairs of the day, political, intellectual, and artistic, as any young woman in Europe. But the war 
found her in a semi-invalid condition and heart- 
broken over the death of her mother, whom she had 



 

nursed devotedly through a long illness; her girlhood 
intimacies broken up not only by the marriage of her 
friends, but also by her own long seclusion; and — 
being quite French — feeling too aged, at a little over 
thirty, ever to interest any man again, aside from her 
fortune. In short she regarded her life as finished, 
but she kept house dutifully for her brother — her 
only close relation — and surrendered herself to melancholy reflections. 

Then came the war. At first she took merely the 
languid interest demanded by her intelligence, being 
too absorbed in her own low condition to experience 
more than a passing thrill of patriotic fervor. But 
she still read the newspapers, and, moreover, women 
in those first anxious days were meeting and talking 
far more frequently than was common to a class that 
preferred their own house and garden to anything 
their friends, or the boulevards, or even the parks of 
Paris, could offer them. Mile. Javal found herself 
seeing more and more of that vast circle of inherited 
friends as well as family connections which no well- 
born bourgeoise can escape, and gradually became infected with the excitement of the hour; despite the 
fact that she believed her poor worn-out body never 
would take a long walk again. 

Then, one day, the thought suddenly illuminated 
her awakening mind : "How fortunate I am ! I have 
no one to lose in this terrible war!" (Her brother was 
too delicate for service.) "These tears I see every 
day after news has come that a father, a brother, at 



husband, a son, has fallen on the battlefield or died of 
horrible agony in hospital, I shall never shed. Almost alone of the many I know, and the millions of 
women in France, I am mercifully exempt from an 
agony that has no end. If I were married, and were 
older and had sons, I should be suffering unendurably now. I am fortunate indeed and feel an ingrate 
that I have ever repined." 

Then naturally enough followed the thought that it 
behooved her to do something for her country, not 
only as a manifest of thanksgiving but also because it 
was her duty as a young woman of wealth and 
leisure. 

Oddly enough considering the delicate health in 
which she firmly believed, she tried to be a nurse. 
There were many amateurs in the hospitals in those 
days when France was as short of nurses as of every- 
thing else except men, and she was accepted. 

But nursing then involved standing all day on one's 
feet and sometimes all night as well, and her pampered 
body was far from strong enough for such a tax in 
spite of her now glowing spirit. While she was casting about for some work in which she might really 
play a useful and beneficent role a friend invited her 
to drive out to the environs of Paris and visit the 
wretched eclopes, to whom several charitable ladies 
occasionally took little gifts of cigarettes and chocolate. 

Then, at last, Mile. Javal found herself; and from 
a halting apprehensive seeker, still weary in mind and 



 

limb, she became almost abruptly one of the most 
original and executive women in France — incidentally 
one of the healthiest. When I met her, some twenty 
months later, she had red cheeks and was the only 
one of all those women of all classes slaving for 
France who told me she never felt tired; in fact felt 
stronger every day. 



The eclopes, in the new adaptation of the word, are 
men who are not ill enough for the military hospitals 
and not well enough to fight. They may have slight 
wounds, or temporary affections of the sight or hearing, the effect of heavy colds; or rheumatism, debilitating sore throat, or furiously aching teeth; or they 
may be suffering too severely from shock to be of 
any use in the trenches. 

There are between six and seven thousand hospi- 
tals in France to-day (possibly more: the French 
never will give you any exact military figures; but 
certainly not less) ; but their beds are for the severely 
wounded or for those suffering from dysentery, fevers, 
pneumonia, bronchitis, tuberculosis. In those first days 
of war before France, caught unprepared in so many 
ways, had found herself and settled down to the business of war; in that trying interval while she was ill 
equipped to care for men brought in hourly to the base 
hospitals, shattered by new and hideous wounds ; there 
was no place for the merely ailing. Men with organic 
affections, suddenly developed under the terrific strain, 



 

were dismissed as Reformes Numero II — unmutilated 
in the service of their country; in other words, dismissed from the army and, for nearly two years, without pension. But the large number of those tempor- 
arily out of condition were sent back of the lines, or 
to a sort of camp outside of Paris, to rest until they 
were in a condition to fight again. 

If it had not been for Mile. Javal it is possible that 
more men than one cares to estimate would never have 
fought again. The eclopes at that time were the most 
abject victims of the war. They remained together 
under military discipline, either behind the lines or on 
the outskirts of Paris, herded in barns, empty factories, thousands sleeping without shelter of any sort. 
Straw for the most part composed their beds, food 
was coarse and scanty; they were so wretched and un- 
comfortable, so exposed to the elements, and without 
care of any sort, that their slight ailments developed 
not infrequently into serious and sometimes fatal cases 
of bronchitis, pneumonia, and even tuberculosis. 

This was a state of affairs well known to General 
Joffre and none caused him more distress and anxiety. 
But — this was between August and November, 1914, 
it must be remembered, when France was anything 
but the magnificent machine she is to-day — it was 
quite impossible for the authorities to devote a cell 
of their harassed brains to the temporarily inept. 
Every executive mind in power was absorbed in pin- 
ning the enemy down, since he could not be driven 
out, feeding the vast numbers of men at the Front, 



 

reorganizing the munition factories, planning for the 
vast supplies of ammunition suddenly demanded, 
equipping the hospitals — when the war broke out there 
were no installations in the hospitals near the Front 
except beds — obtaining the necessary amount of surgical supplies, taking care of the refugees that poured 
into the larger cities by every train not only from 
Belgium but from the French towns invaded or 
bombarded — to mention but a few of the problems that 
beset France suddenly forced to rally and fight for 
her life, and, owing to the Socialist majority in the 
Chamber of Deputies, criminally unprepared. 

There were plenty of able minds in France that 
knew what was coming; months before the war broke 
out (a year, one of the infirmiere majors told me; but, 
as I have said, it is difficult to pin a French official 
down to exact statements) the Service de Sante 
(Health Department of the Ministry of War) asked 
the Countess d'Haussonville, President of the Red 
Cross, to train as many nurses as quickly as possible, 
for there was not an extra nurse in a military hospital 
of France — in many there was none at all. But these 
patriotic and far-sighted men were powerless. The 
three years' service bill was the utmost result of their 
endeavors, and for six months after the war began 
they had not a gun larger than the famous Seventy- 
fives but those captured at the Battle of the Marne. 

As for the poor eclopes, there never was a clearer 
example of the weaker going to the wall and the devil 
taking the hindmost. They had been turned out to 



 

grass mildly afflicted, but in a short time they were 
progressing rapidly toward the grave or that detestable status known as Reformes Numero II. And 
every man counts in France. Quite apart from 
humanity it was a terribly serious question for the 
Grand Quartier General, where Joffre and his staff 
had their minds on the rack. 



IV 

The Cure of St. Honore d'Eylau was the first to 
discover the eclopes, and not only sent stores to certain of the depots where they were herded, but per- 
suaded several ladies of Paris to visit and take them 
little presents. But practically every energetic and pa- 
triotic woman in France was already mobilized in the 
service of her country. As I have explained elsewhere, 
they had opened ouvroirs, where working girls suddenly deprived of the means of livelihood could fend 
off starvation by making underclothing and other 
necessaries for the men at the Front. Upon these de- 
voted women, assisted by nearly all the American 
women resident in Paris, fell to a great extent the care 
of the refugees; and many were giving out rations 
three times a day, not only to refugees but to the poor 
of Paris, suddenly deprived of their wage earners. It 
was some time before the Government got round to 
paying the daily allowance of one-franc-twenty-five to 
the wives and seventy-five centimes (fifty outside of 
Paris) for each child, known as the allocation. Moreover, in those dread days when the Germans were driv- 
ing straight for Paris, many fled with the Government to Bordeaux (not a few Americans ignominiously scampered off to England) and did not return 
for three weeks or more; during which time those 
brave enough to remain did ten times as much work 
as should be expected even of the nine-lived female. 

They knew at this critical time as well as later when 
they were breathing normally again that the poor 
eclopes beyond the barrier were without shelter in the 
autumn rains and altogether in desperate plight; but 
it was only now and again that a few found time to 
pay them a hasty visit and cheer them with those little 
gifts so dear to the imaginative heart of the French 
soldier. Sooner or later, of course, the Government 
would have taken them in hand and organized them as 
meticulously as they have organized every conceivable 
angle of this great struggle; but meanwhile thousands 
would have died or shambled home to" litter the villages 
as hopeless invalids. Perhaps hundreds of thousands 
is a safer computation, and these hundreds of thousands Mile. Javal saved for France. 



Today there are over one hundred and thirty 
ficlope Depots in France; two or three are near Paris, 
the rest in the towns and villages of the War Zone. 
The long baraques are well built, rain-proof and 
draught-proof, but with many windows which are open
