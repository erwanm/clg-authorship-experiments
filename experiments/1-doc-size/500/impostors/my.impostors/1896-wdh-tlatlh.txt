It was Westover who drove to meet JefE at the sta- 
tion, when he got his dispatch, naming the train he 



 

would take, and he found him looking very well, and 
perhaps stouter than he had been. 

They left the station in silence, after their greeting 
and Jefi's inquiries about Jackson. Jeff had taken 
the reins, and now he put them with the whip in one 
hand, and pushed up his hat with the other, and 
turned his face full upon Westover. " Notice any- 
thing in particular ? " he demanded. 

" No ; yes — some slight marks." 

" I guess that fellow fixed me up pretty well : paints 
black eyes, and that kind of thing. I got to scrap- 
ping with a man, Class Day ; we wanted to settle a 
little business we began at the Tree, and he left his 
marks on me. I meant to tell you the truth as soon 
as I could get at you ; but I had to say erysipelas in 
my letter. I guess, if you don't mind, we'll let ery- 
sipelas stand, with the rest." 

" I shouldn't have cared," Westover said, " if you'd 
let it stand with me." 

" Oh, thank you," Jeff returned. 

There could have been no show of affection at his 
meeting with Jackson even if there had been any fact 
of it ; that was not the law of their life. But Jeff had 
always been a turbulent, rebellious younger brother, 
resentful of Jackson's control, too much his junior to 
have the associations of an equal companionship in the 
past, and yet too near him in age to have anything 
like a filial regard for him. They shook hands, and 
each asked the other how he was, and then they 
seemed to have done with each other. Jeff's mother 
kissed him in addition to the handshaking, but made 



him feel her preoccupation with Jackson ; she asked 
him if he had hurried home on Jackson's account, and 
he promptly lied her out of this anxiety. 

He shook hands with Cynthia, too, but it was across 
the barrier which had not been lowered between them 
since they parted. He spoke to Jackson about her, 
the day after he came home, when Jackson said he 
was feeling unusually strong and well, and the two 
brothers had strolled out through the orchard togeth- 
er. Now and then he gave the sick man his arm, and 
when he wanted to sit down in a sunny place, he 
spread the shawl he carried for him. 

" I suppose mother's told you about Cynthy and 
me, Jackson ? " he began. 

Jackson answered, with lack-lustre eyes, " Yes." 
Presently he asked, " What's become of the other girl ? " 

" Damn her ! I don't hnow what's become of her, 
and I don't care ! " JefE exploded, furiously. 

"Then you don't care for her any more?" Jackson 
pursued, with the same languid calm. 

" I never cared for her." 

Jackson was silent, and the matter seemed to have 
faded out of his mind. But it was keenly alive in 
JefE's mind, and he was in the strange necessity which 
men in the flush of life and health often feel of seek- 
ing counsel of those who stand in the presence of 
death, as if their words should have something of the 
mystical authority of the unknown wisdom they are 
about to penetrate. 

" What I  want to know is, what I am going to do 
about Cynthy ? " 



 

" I don't know," Jackson answered, vaguely, and lie 
expressed by his indirection the sense he must some- 
times have had of his impending fate — " I don't know 
what she's going to do, her or mother, either." 

"Yes," JefE assented, "that's what I think of. 
And I'd do anything that I could — that you thought 
was right." 

Jackson apparently concentrated his mind upon the 
question by an eSort. "Do you care as much for 
Cynthy as you used to ? " 

"Yes," said JefE, after a moment, " as much as I 
ever did ; and more. But I've been thinking, since 
the thing happened, that, if I'd cared for her the way 
she did for me, it wouldn't have happened. Look 
here, Jackson ! You know I've never pretended to 
be like some men — like Mr. Westover, for example — 
always looking out for the right and the wrong, and 
all that. I didn't make myself, and I guess if the 
Almighty don't make me go right it's because he 
don't want me to. But I have got a conscience about 
Cynthy, and I'd be willing to help out a little if I 
knew how, about her. The devil of it is, I've got to 
being afraid. I don't mean that I'm not fit for her ; 
any man's fit for any woman if he wants her bad 
enough ; but I'm afraid I sha'n't ever care for her in 
the right way. That's the point. I've cared for just 
one woman in this world, and it a'n't Cynthy, as far 
as I can make out. But she's gone, and I guess I 
could coax Cynthy round again, and I could be what 
she wants me to be, after this." 

Jackson lay upon his shawl, looking up at the sky 




full of islands of warm clouds in its sea of blue ; he 
was silent so long that JefE began to think he had not 
been listening ; he could not hear him breathe, and he 
came forward to him quickly from the shadow of the 
tree where he sat. 

" Well ? " Jackson whispered, turning his eyes upon 
him. 

"Well?" Jeff returned. 

" I guess you'd better let it alone," said Jackson. 

" All right. That's what I think, too." 



XLIX. 

Jackson died a week later, and they buried him 
in the old family lot in the farthest corner of the or- 
chard. His mother and Cynthia put on mourning 
for him, and they stood together by his open grave, 
Mrs. Durgin leaning upon her son's arm and the girl 
upon her father's. The woman wept quietly, but 
JefE's eyes were dry, though his face was discharged 
of all its prepotent impudence. Westover, standing 
across the grave from him, noticed the marks on his 
forehead that he said were from his scrapping, and 
wondered what really made them. He recognized 
the spot where they were standing as that where the 
boy had obeyed the law of his nature and revenged 
the stress put upon him for righteousness. Over the 
stone of the nearest grave JeS had shown a face of 
triumphant derision when he pelted Westover with 
apples. The painter's mind fell into a chaos of con- 
jecture and misgiving, so that he scarcely took in the 
words of the composite service which the minister 
from the Union Chapel at the Huddle read over the 
dead. 

Some of the guests from the hotel came to the fu- 




 

neral, but otliers who were not in good healtli re- 
mained away, any there was a general sense among 
them, which imparted itself to Westover, that Jack- 
son's dying so, at the beginning of the season, was 
not a fortunate incident. As he sat talking with 
Jeff at a corner of the piazza late in the afternoon, 
Frank Whitwell came up to them and said there 'vyere 
some people in the office who had driven over from 
another hotel to see about board, but they had heard 
there was sickness in the house, and wished to talk 
with him. 

" I won't come," said Jeff. 

" They're not satisfied with what I've said," the 
boy urged. " What shall I tell them ? " 

" Tell them to — go to the devil," said Jeff, and 
when Frank Whitwell made off with this message for 
delivery in such decent terms as he could imagine for 
it, Jeff said, rather to himself than to Westover, " I 
don't see how we're going to run this hotel with that 
old family lot down there in the orchard, much 
longer." 

He assumed the air of full authority at Lion's 
Head ; and Westover felt the stress of a painful con- 
jecture in regard to the Whitwells intensified upon 
him from the moment he turned away from Jackson's 
grave. 

Cynthia and her father had gone back to their own 
house as soon as Jeff returned, and though the girl 
came home with Mrs. Durgin after the funeral, and 
helped her in their common duties through the after- 
noon and evening, Westover saw her taking her way 



 

down the liill with lier brother when the long day's 
work was over. Jeff saw her too ; he was sitting with 
Westover at the office door smoking, and he was talk- 
ing of the Whitwells. 

" I suppose they won't stay," he said, " and I can't 
expect it ; but I don't know what mother will do, ex- 
actly." 

At the same moment Whitwell came round the cor- 
ner of the hotel from the barn, and approached them. 
" Jeff, I guess I better tell you straight off that we're 
goin', the children and me." 

"All right, Mr. Whitwell," said Jeff, with respect- 
ful gravity, " I was afraid of it." 

Westover made a motion to rise, but Whitwell laid 
a detaining hand upon his knee. "There ain't any- 
thing so private about it, so far as I know." 

" Don't go, Mr. Westover," said Jeff, and Westover 
remained. 

"We a'n't a-goin' to leave you in the lurch, and 
we want you should take your time, especially Mis' 
Durgin. But the sooner the better. Heigh ? " 

"Yes, I understand that, Mr. Whitwell; I guess 
mother will miss you, but if you must go, you must." 
The two men remained silent a moment, and then 
Jeff broke out passionately, rising and flinging his 
cigar away : " I wish I  could go, instead ! That would 
be the right way, and I guess mother would like it 
full as well. Do you see any way to manage it ? " 
He put his foot up in his chair, and dropped his elbow 
on his knee, with his chin propped in his hand. 
Westover could see that he meant what he was saying. 



 

"If there was any way, I'd do it. I know what you 
think of me, and I should be just Hke you, in your 
place. I don't feel right to turn you out here, I don't, 
Mr. Whitwell, and yet if I stay, I've got to do it. 
What's the reason I can't go ? " 

" You can't," said Whitwell, " and that's all about 
it. We shouldn't let you, if you could. But I a'n't 
surprised you feel the way you do," he added, un- 
sparingly. "As you say, I should feel just so my- 
self if I was in your place. Well, good-night, Mr. 
Westover. " 

Whitwell turned and slouched down the hill, leav- 
ing the painter to the most painful moment he had 
known with Jefi Durgin, and nearer sympathy. 
"That's all right, Mr. Westover," JefE said, "I don't 
blame him." 

He remained in a constraint from which he pres- 
ently broke with mocking hilarity when Jombateeste 
came round the corner of the house, as if he had been 
waiting for Whitwell to be gone, and told JefE he 
must get somebody else to look after the horses. 

" Why don't you wait and take the horses with 
you, Jombateeste ? " he inquired. " They'll be hand- 
ing in their resignation, the next thing. Why not go 
altogether?" 

The little Canuck paused, as if uncertain whether 
he was made the object of unfriendly derision or not, 
and looked at Westover for help. Apparently he de- 
cided to chance it in as bitter an answer as he could 
invent. " The 'oss can't 'elp 'imself, Mr. Durgin. 'E 
stay. But you don' hown everybody." 



 

"That's so, Jombateeste," said Jeff. "That's a 
good hit. It makes me feel awfully. Have a cigar ? " 
The Canuck declined with a dignified bow, and Jeff 
said: " You don't smoke any more? Oh, I see ! It's 
my tobacco you're down on. What's the matter, 
Jombateeste ? What are you going away for ? " Jeff 
lighted for himself the cigar the Canuck had refused, 
and smoked down upon the little man. 

"Mr. W'itwell goin'," Jombateeste said, a little 
confused and daunted. 

"What's Mr. Whitwell going for?" 

" You hask Mr. W'itwell." 

" All right. And if I can get him to stay will you 
stay too, Jombateeste ? I don't like to see a rat leav- 
ing a ship ; the ship's sure to sink, if he does. How 
do you suppose I'm going to run Lion's Head without 
you to throw down hay to the horses ? It will be ruin 
to me, sure, Jombateeste. All the guests know how 
you play on the pitchfork out there, and they'll leave 
in a body if they hear you've quit. Do say you'll 
stay, and I'll reduce your wages one half on the spot." 

Jombateeste waited to hear no more injuries. He 
said, "You'll don' got money enough, Mr. Durgin, by 
gosh ! to reduce my wages," and he started down the 
hill towards Wbitwell's house with as great loftiness as 
could comport with a downhill gait and his stature. 

" Well, I seem to be getting it all round, Mr. West- 
over," said Jeff. " This must make you feel good. 
I don't know but I begin to believe there's a God in 
Israel, myself." 

He walked away without saying good-night, and 




Westover went to bed without the chance of setting 
himself right. In the morning, when he came down 
to breakfast, and stopped at the desk to engage a con- 
veyance for the station from Frank Whitwell, the boy 
forestalled him with a grave face. " You don't know 
about Mrs. Durgin ? " 

" No ; what about her ? " 

" Well, we can't tell exactly. Father thinks it's a 
shock ; Jombateeste's gone over to Lovewell for the 
doctor. Cynthia's with her. It seemed to come on 
in the night." 

He spoke softly, that no one else might hear ; but 
by noon the fact that Mrs. Durgin had been stricken 
with paralysis was all over the place. The gloom 
cast upon the opening season by Jackson's death was 
deepened among the guests. Some who had talked 
of staying through July went away that day. But 
under Cynthia's management the housekeeping was 
really unaffected by Mrs. Durgin's calamity, and the 
people who stayed found themselves as comfortable as 
ever. Jefi came fully into the hotel management, and 
in their business relation Cynthia and he were contin- 
ually together ; there was no longer a question of the 
Whitwells leaving him ; even Jombateeste persuaded 
himself to stay, and Westover felt obliged to remain 
at least till the present danger in Mrs. Durgin's case 
was past. 

With the first return of physical strength, Mrs. 
Durgin was impatient to be seen about the house, and 
to retrieve the season that her affliction had made so 
largely a loss. The people who had become accus- 



 

tomed to it stayed on, and the house filled up as she 
grew better, but even the sight of her in a wheeled 
chair did not bring back the prosperity of other years. 
She lamented over it with a keen and full perception 
of the fact, but in a cloudy association of it with the 
joint future of JefE and Cynthia. 

One day, after Mrs. Durgin had declared that she 
did not know what they were to do, if things kept 
on as they were going, Whitwell asked his daughter, 
" Do you suppose she thinks you and JefE have made 
it up again? " 

" I don't know," said the girl, with a troubled voice, 
" and I don't know what to do about it. It don't seem 
as if I could tell her, and yet it's wrong to let her go 
on." 

" Why didn't he tell her ? " demanded her father. 
" 'Ta'n't fair his leavin' it to you. But it's like him ! " 

The sick woman's hold upon the fact weakened 
most when she was tired. When she was better, she 
knew how it was with them. Commonly it was when 
Cynthia had got her to bed for the night that she sent 
for Jeff, and wished to ask him what he was going to 
do. " You can't expect Cynthy to stay here another 
winter helpin' you, with Jackson away. You've got 
to either take her with you, or else come here your- 
self. Give up your last year in college, why don't 
you ? I  don't want you should stay, and I don't know 
who does. If I was in Cynthia's place, I'd let you 
work off your own conditions now, you've give up the 
law. She'll kill herself, tryin' to keep you along." 

Sometimes her speech became so indistinct that no 



 

one but Cynthia could make it out ; and Je£E, listening 
with a face as nearly discharged as might be of its 
laughing irony, had to turn to Cynthia for the word 
which no one else could catch, and which the stricken 
woman remained distressfully waiting for her to re- 
peat to him, with her anxious eyes upon the girl's face. 
He was dutifully patient with all his mother's whims. 
He came whenever she sent for him, and sat quiet 
under the severities with which she visited all his past 
unworthiness. "Who you been hectorin' now, I 
should like to know," she began on him one even- 
ing when he came at her summons. " Between you 
and Fox, I got no peace of my life. Where is the 
dog?" 

" Fox is all right, mother," Jeff responded. " You're 
feeling a little better to-night, a'n't you ? " 

"I don't know; I can't tell," she returned, with a 
gleam of intelligence in her eye. Then she said, " I 
don't see why I'm left to strangers all the time." 

" You don't call Cynthia a stranger, do you, moth- 
er ? " he asked, coaxingly. 

" Oh, — Cynthy ! " said Mrs. Durgin, with a glance 
as of surprise at seeing her. " No, Cynthy's all right. 
But Where's Jackson and your father ? If I've told 
them not to be out in the dew once, I've told 'em a 
hundred times. Cynthy'd better look after her house- 
keepin' if she don't want the whole place to run be- 
hind, and not a soul left in the house. What time 
o' year is it now ? " she suddenly asked, after a little 
weary pause. 

" It's the last of August, mother." 



 

" Oh," she sighed, " I thought it was the begirniin' 
of May. Didn't you come up here in May ? " 

" Yes." 

" Well, then — Or, mebbe that's one o' them tor- 
mentin' dreams ; they do pester so ! What did you 
come for ? " 

JefE was sitting on one side of her bed and Cynthia 
on the other. She was looking at the sufferer's face, 
and she did not meet the glance of amusement which 
Jeff turned upon her at being so fairly cornered. 
" Well, I don't know," he said. " I thought you 
might like to see me." 

" What' d he come for ? " — the sick woman turned 
to Cynthia. 

" You'd better tell her," said the girl, coldly, to 
Jeff. " She -won't be satisfied till you do. She'll 
keep coming back to it." 

" Well, mother," said Jeff, still with something of 
his hardy amusement, " I hadn't been acting just 
right, and I thought I'd better tell Cynthy." 

" You better let the child alone. If I ever catch 
you teasin' them children again, I'll make Jackson 
shoot Fox." 

"All right, mother," said Jeff.
