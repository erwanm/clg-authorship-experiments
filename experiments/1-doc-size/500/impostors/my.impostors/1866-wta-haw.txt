a pistol to them, drove them below again, and threat- 
ened to shoot them if they made any noise. A 
similar demonstration quieted the fireman, and com- 
pelled him to return to the fire-room. 

" The job is done," said Baker, the leader of the 
enterprise. 

" But we haven't got the money," added Flint, 
the deck hand. 

" We don't want that yet. It is safe where it is. 
Now both of you to your stations," continued Baker ; 
and he went down into the fire-room. 

Ben's station was in the wheel-house, Flint's at the 
fasts, and Baker's at the engine, as it appeared from 
their subsequent movements ; and it was evident, from 



 

the operations in progress, that the villains intended 
to make their escape in the steamer. Baker stopped 
the hissing steam which was going to waste, and 
compelled the fireman to renew the fires. 

" Be lively ! " shouted Ben, from the wheel-house, 
as he discovered Lawry on the shore, hastening back 
to the steamer with his bundle of clothes. 

" All ready ! " replied Baker, finding there was 
steam enough to start the boat. 

Flint had already cast ofi" the fasts, without waiting 
for orders, and was standing on the forecastle, as 
impatient to be off as a man can be who is engaged 
in the commission of a crime. 

Ben rang the bell to back her ; the wheels turned, 
but as the stern line had been cast ofi", her bow was 
not carried out from the wharf. By this time Lawry 
had discovered that the Woodville was in motion. 
He was astonished and alarmed, though he was far 
from surmising that his boat had been captured by 
robbers. Running with all his speed, he reached the 
head of the vharf just as the boat had backed far 
enough to permit Ben to see him, and for him 
to see that Ben was at the wheel. Then he 







realized that his brother was engaged in another 
conspiracy. 

Notwithstanding his extensive knowledge of 
" steamboating " in general, Ben Wilford was a 
very unskilful pilot. If he had understood the man- 
agement of a boat half as well as Lawry, the nefa- 
rious scheme might have been successful. He saw 
his brother ; he did not wish to have him come on 
board, for Lawry might be so obstinate as to induce 
one of his dissolute companions to fire at him. He 
rang the bell to stop her, and then to go ahead, at 
the same time putting the helm hard a-port. 

The Woodville went forward, and as she met the 
helm her bow came round, and she was headed out 
into the middle of the lake. As she went ahead, 
her stern swept in a circle within a few feet of the 
wharf, just as Lawry, breathless with haste and alarm, 
reached the end of the pier. The little captain knew 
nothing of the state of things on board, except that 
his brother Ben was at the wheel, which, however, 
was a sufficient explanation to him. The Woodville 
was going, and he could not let her depart without 
him. Dropping his bundle, he leaped to the plank- 



 

shear, grasping the rail with both hands. Jumping 
over the bulwark, he stood on the guard from which 
opened the windows of the saloon. 

Neither of the three conspirators were in a sit- 
uation to see this movement on the part of Lawry. 
Ben was too much occupied in steering — for he was 
not a little fearful of getting aground in some shoal 
water between the ferry and the wharf — to notice 
anything ; but as soon as he had obtained his course, 
he looked for his brother on the pier. He was not 
there ; but Ben did not suspect that he was on 
board the Woodville. Baker, who knew just enough 
about an engine to stop and start it, was working 
the valves with the bar ; and he could think of 
nothing else. Doubtless he was conscious by this 
time that he had " taken a big job," in assuming 
the control of the engine. 

Lawry was bewildered by the situation. When 
his feet struck the deck, his first impulse was to 
rush up to the wheel-house, and confront the diffi- 
culty as the case might require. He started to carry 
out his purpose, when he happened to look through 
one of the saloon windows, and discovered Ethan, 



 



with the handkerchief in his mouth, tied to the 
stanchion. Deeply as he sympathized with his friend 
in his unpleasant position, he was still cheered by 
the sight, for it assured him that the engineer had 
been faithful to his duties, and was not a party to 
the conspiracy. 

The little captain went round and entered the 
saloon by the door, without being seen by either 
of the conspirators. He removed the gag from 
Ethan's mouth, and proceeded to unfasten the cords 
with which he was bound. 

" What does all this mean, Ethan ? " demanded 
Lawry, in excited tones, and almost crying with 
vexation. 

" Hush ! Do they know you are here ? " asked 
the engineer. 

" I think not ; I don't know." 

" Keep still, then. They are after the gold." 

" Who are they ? " 

" Ben and two other fellows. I don't know 
them." 

" We'll stop this thing very quick," said Lawry, 
in hurried tones. 



 

" They are armed with pistols, and threatened to 
shoot all hands. Be careful, Lawry, or you will 
get a bullet through your head." 

" What shall we do ? " demanded the young pilot, 
who had no desire to be shot. 

Ethan was an accomplished strategist ; he had 
fought the Indians both with his wits and his weap- 
ons, and he promptly undertook the management 
of the affair. He led the way to the lower cabin, 
where the terrified women had been driven by 
the ruffians. Mrs. Light declared she was fright- 
ened out of her senses, and she " never did hear 
of such goings on." 

" If any of those men ask for me, tell them I 
got loose, jumped overboard, and swam ashore," 
said Ethan. 

" Law sake ! " exclaimed the cook. 

" Don't tell them I am here, at any rate." 

" I won't. Massy sake ! What on airth are we 
comin' to ? " 

" Don't be alarmed ; we will take care of these 
villains before we have done with them," added 
Ethan. 

 



 



" Hush ! There's some one coming," said one of 
the girls ; and the heavy tread of a man was heard 
on the deck above them. 

Ethan and Lawry had only time to crawl into 
one of the berths, where Mrs. Light covered them 
with bed-clothes, before Flint came down into the 
cabin. 

" See here ; we haven't been to supper, and we 
want some," said the ruffian, as he descended the 
steps. 

" What are you goin' to do with us ? " demanded 
Mrs. Light. 

" Don't be scart ; we won't hurt you," replied 
Flint. 

" But where you goin' ? " 

" Up to Whitehall. When we get there, you can 
go where you please. Now, get us some supper ; 
the best there is on board — beefsteak and coffee." 

" Well, I suppose I can get you some supper ; 
but I don't like such carryin's on," replied Mrs. 
Light. 

Flint left the cabin, after he had given his order. 
On his way forward he looked into the saloon, and 



 

discovered that their prisoner was missing. Search 
was immediately instituted ; but Mrs. Light, as in- 
structed by Ethan, declared that he had got loose, 
and swam ashore ; she had seen him through the 
stern lights. The rascals finally accepted this ex- 
planation, after searching on deck for him. 

Mrs. Light went to the kitchen to get supper for 
the rogues, while the girls set the table. The cook 
presently returned to the cabin, and told Ethan 
where each of the robbers was stationed ; but being 
unarmed, there seemed to be no way of making an 
attack upon them where the ruffians could not rally 
to the support of each other. 

" We must settle this business down here, Lawry," 
said Ethan, when they had come out of their hiding- 
places. 

" They will have to come to supper one at a 
time," added the little captain. 

" Exactly so ; and this will be the safest place 
to do the job. We want a rope," added the en- 
gineer, with a business-like air. 

" I'll fetch you a rope," said Mrs. Light. 

" Do ; bring me the small heave-line, on the 
guard by the saloon doors." 







The cook went on deck, and after a visit to the 
kitchen, returned to the cabin with the line indi- 
cated under her apron. In about half an hour sup- 
per was ready for the villains, and one of the girls 
informed Baker, who was still on duty in the engine- 
room, that it was waiting for them. The engineer 
called Flint, and told him, as the boat was out in 
the middle of the lake, the engine would need noth- 
ing done to it, and directed him to stand at the 
door, so that the fireman below should not attempt 
to defeat their plans. He then went to the cabin 
for his supper. 

Ethan and Lawry had concealed themselves be- 
hind the curtains of a tier of berths, directly in the 
rear of the chair where Baker was to sit at the 
table. In his hand Ethan held the heave-line, at 
one end of which Lawry had made a hangman's 
noose. Mrs. Light and the girls had been instructed 
to rattle the chairs, make as much noise as they 
could, and otherwise engage the attention of the 
robber, as soon as he sat down to the table. 

Baker came down the stairs, and one of the girls 
began to rattle the chairs, Mrs. Light to move a 



 

pile of plates, and the other girl to arrange the 
dishes on the table. 

" Will you have some coffee ? " demanded Mrs. 
Light, without giving him time to notice anything 
in the cabin. 

" Of course I will," growled Baker. 

" Shall I give you some beefsteak ? " asked one- 
of the girls. 

." I'll help myself." 

" If you want some fried eggs I'll get some for 
you," added the cook, rattling the dishes again. 

Baker was not permitted to say whether he would 
have any fried eggs or not, for at that moment 
Ethan crept from his concealment, whatever noise 
lie made being drowned by the clatter of the dishes 
and the rattling of the chairs. Stealing up behind 
Baker, who was intent only on beefsteak and coffee, 
he slipped the hangman's noose over his head, and 
hauled it tight. The robber attempted to spring to 
his feet, but Ethan hauled him over backwards on the 
floor. At the same time Lawry tlirew the end of 
the line over a deck beam, extended across the sky- 
light, and began to " haul in the slack." 




 



The villain attempted to cry out ; but the sound 
only gurgled in his throat. He grasped the rope 
with both hands ; but the choking already received 
had taken away his strength, and he was unable to 
taake any successful resistance. While Lawry kept 
the rope so taut that Baker could not move, Ethan 
tied his hands behind him, though the man's strug- 
gles were fierce, and the engineer was obliged to 
Use a rolling-pin, supplied by Mrs. Light, before 
the conquest was complete. The rufEan was se- 
curely bound and gagged ; but the cook and the 
girls had nearly fainted while the struggle was go- 
ing on. 

Baker, thus gagged and bound, was rolled into 
one of the lower berths. He had been nearly 
choked to death by the rope, and several hard 
knocks he had received on the head had rendered 
him partially insensible, so that he was not in con- 
dition to make any further resistance. Ethan had 
taken possession of his pistol, and, as a matter of 
precaution, threatened to blow out his brains if he 
made any noise. , 

" Massy sake ! " groaned Mrs. Light, when the 



 

work was accomplished. " I never did see ! You've 
taken my breath all away ! " 

" Don't make a noise," said Ethan. 

" I couldn't have struck that man as you did,'! 
added Lawry. 

" If you had been through what I have, out west, 
it would come easier to you," replied the engineer, 
glancing at the berth where the prisoner had been 
concealed by the curtains. " We must go through 
the whole of it once more." 

One of the girls was then sent to call Flint, and 
directed to assure him that such was the order of 
Baker, who had gone to the wheel-house for a mo- 
ment, and would immediately return to the engine- 
room. The deck hand was too much in a hurry for 
his supper to question the order, and went directly 
to the cabin. The noise made by Mrs. Light and 
the girls prevented him from hearing the heavy 
breathings of Baker, and he was an easier victim 
than his companion in crime had been. He was 
choked, gagged, bound, and his pistol taken from 
him. By this time these two ruffians, if they could 
think at all, could not help believing that the way 
of the transgressor is hard. 



 



From regard to the feelings of Lawry, Ethan de- 
cided that Ben should not be subjected to this harsh 
treatment. He was still in the wheel-house, not sus- 
pecting that his nefarious scheme had been wholly 
defeated. 

The work was accomplished, and the pilot and 
engineer went on deck. Ethan repaired to his post 
and stopped the engine. Ben half a dozen times 
demanded, through the speaking-tube, what the mat- 
ter was ; but receiving no answer, he came down 
himself to ascertain the cause of the sudden stoppage 
of the boat. 



 



CHAPTER XX. 

THE LITTLE CAPTAIN AND HIS MOTTO. 

As Ben Wilford, fearful tliat some accident to the 
machinery would defeat his criminal enterprise, en- 
tered the engine-room on one side, Laivry left it at 
the other. As the little captain went forward, he 
heard a noise in the forecastle, and saw that the 
companion-way was closed and fastened. Releasing 
the firemen and deck hands confined there, he di- 
rected them to follow him to the Mheel-house, where 
he explained to them what had happened. 

" What are you stopping for ? " demanded Ben 
Wilford, before he discovered that Baker was not 
present. 

" I think it is about time to go back, now," 
replied Ethan, holding one of the pistols in his 
hand. 

" How came you here, Ethan ? " exclaimed Ben, 






starting back with astonishment when he saw who 
was in charge of the engine. 

" I run this machine, and this is the right place for 
me," replied Ethan, coolly. 

" Where's Baker ? " 

"He's safe; if you mean the man you left in 
charge of the engine." 

Ben was bewildered by the present aspect of af- 
fairs. It was clear that there had been a miscarriage 
somewhere ; but he was unable to tell how or where 
the scheme had failed. Before he could decide what 
step to take next. Captain Lawry rang the bell to go 
ahead. 

" Who rang the bell ? " asked Ben. , 
" Captain Lawry." 
" Is he on board ? " 

" He is," replied Ethan, as he started the engine. 
" Ben Wilford, you have got about to the end of your 
rope." 

"What do you mean?" 

" You have done a job which will send you to Sing 
Sing for the next ten years." 

"No, I haven't," said Ben, backing out of the 
engine-room. 



 

" Stop where you are," interposed Ethan, peremp- 
torily, as he raised his pistol. 

" Two can play at that game," added Ben. 

" Two can ; but two won't. Drop your hands, or 
I'll fire ! " 

Ben obeyed ; he had felt that the game was up 
the moment he saw Ethan at his post, and he had 
not the courage to draw his pistol upon one who had 
shot two Indians in one day. 

" Sit down there," continued Ethan, pointing to
