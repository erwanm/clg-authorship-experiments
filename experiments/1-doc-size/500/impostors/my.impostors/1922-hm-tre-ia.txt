many of which society had condemned long since 
because they entailed too much trouble. Imagine 
her, putting herself to all this delay and inconven- 
ience for a young wastrel she did not know and who, 
the moment he got on his feet, would doubtless pass 
out of her life without so much as Thank you ! And 
it was ten to one that she would not comprehend the 
ingratitude. To such characters, fine actions are in 
themselves sufficient. 

Perhaps her odd beauty — and that too was na- 
tural — stirred these thoughts into being. Ashen 
blonde, a shade that would never excite the cynical 
commentary which men applied to certain types of 
blondes. It would be protective; it would with age 
turn to silver unnoticeably. A disconcerting gray 
eye that had a mystifying depth. In the artificial 
light her skin had the tint and lustre of a yellow pearl. 
She would be healthy, too, and vigorous. Not the 
explosive vigour of the north-bom, but that which 
Vould quietly meet physical hardships and bear 
them triumphantly. 

All this while he was arranging the medicines on 
the stand and jotting down his instructions on a 
chart sheet. He had absorbed her in a single glance, 
and was now defining her as he worked. After a while 

he spoke again. 


" Our talking will not bother him. He will be some 
time in this comatose state. Later, there will be 
fever, after I've got his heart pumping. Now, he 





must have folks somewhere. I'm going through 
his pockets. It's only right that his people 
should know where he is and what has happened 
to him ' 

But he searched in vain. Aside from some loose 
coin and a trunk key, there was nothing in the 
pockets: no mail, no letter of credit, not even a 
tailor's label. Immediately he grasped the fact 
that there was drama here, probably the old drama 
of the fugitive. He folded the garments carefully 
and replaced them on the chair. 

''I'm afraid we'll have to dig into ids trunk," he 
said. "There's nothing in his clothes. Perhaps 
I ought not to; but this isn't a case to fiddle-faddle 
over. Will you stand by and watch me? " 

The contents of the trunk only thickened the fog. 
Here again the clothes were minus the labels. All 
the linen was new and stamped with the mark of 
Whiteaway, Laidlaw & Co., British merchants with 
branches all over the East. At the bottom of 
the trunk was a large manila envelope, immarked. 
The doctor drew out the contents hopefully. 

"By George!" he exclaimed. "Manuscripts! 
Why, this chap is a writer, or is trying to be. 
And will you look! His name neatly cut out from 
each title page. This is clear over my head." 

"A novelist?" cried Ruth, thrilling. And yet 
the secondary emotion was one of suspicion. That 
a longing of hers should be realized in this strange 



 

fashion was difficult to believe: it vaguely suggested 
something of a trap. 

"Or trying to be," answered the doctor. "Evidently he could not destroy these children of his. 
No doubt they've all been rejected; but he couldn't 
throw them overboard. I suspect he has a bit of 
vanity. I'll tell you what. I'll leave these out, 
and to-morrow you can read them through. Some- 
where you may stumble upon a clew to his identity. 
To-morrow I'll wire Cook's and the American 
Express in Hong-Kong to see if there is any mail. 
Taber is the name. What is he —  English or Ameri- 
can?" 

"American. What is a Yale man?" 

''Did he say he was a Yale man?" 

"He and Ah Cum were talking. . . ." 

"I see. Ah Cum is a Yale man and so is this 
Taber." 

"But what is it?" 

"An American university. Now, I'll be getting 
along. Give him his medicine every half hour. Keep 
his arms down. I'll have my man Wu over here as 
soon as I can get in touch with him. We'll get this 
chap on his feet if only to learn what the trouble is." 

Downstairs he sought the hotel manager. 

"Can you pull him through?" was the anxious 
question. 

"Hope to. The next few hours will tell. But 
it's an odd case. His name is Taber?" 







"Howard Taber." 

"Confidentially, I'm assured that he has another' 

What gives you that idea? 
Well, we could find no letter of credit, no letters, 
no labels in his clothes —  not a single clew to his 
real identity. And stony broke ' 

"Not quite," replied the manager. "He left 
an envelope with some money in it. Perhaps I'd 
better open it now." The envelope contained 
exactly five hundred dollars. "How long will he 
be laid up?" 

" Three or four weeks, if he doesn't peg out during 
the night." 

The manager began some computations. "There 
won't be much left for you," he said. 

"That's usual. There never is much left for me. 
But I'm not worrying about that. The thing is to 
get the patient on his feet. He may have resources 
of which we know nothing," the doctor added 
optimistically. 

"But, I say, that girl is a queer one." 

"I shouldn't call her queer. She's fine. She'll 
be mighty interesting to watch." 

"For an old bachelor?" 

"A human old bachelor. Has she any funds?" 

"She must have. She's headed' for America. Of 
course, I don't believe she's what you would call 
flush. But I'll take care of her bill, if worst comes 
to worst. Evidently her foresight has saved me a 



 

funeral. I'll remember that. But "fine" is the word. 
How the deuce, though, am I going to account for 
her? People will be asking questions when they see 
her; %sA if I tell the truth, they'll start to snubbing 
her. . You imderstand what I mean. I don't want 
her hurt. But we've got to cook up some kind of 
a story to protect her." 

''I hadn't thought of that. It wouldn't do to 
say that she was from the hospital. She's too 
pretty and unusual. Besides, I'm afraid her simple 
honesty will spoil any invented yam. When anybody is natural, these days, we dub them queer. 
The contact is disturbing; and we prefer going 
around the fact to facing it. Aren't we funny? 
And just as I was beginning to lose faith in human 
beings, to have someone like this come along! 
It is almost as if she were acting a role, and she 
isn't. I'll talk to her in the morning, but she 
won't understand what I'm driving at. Born on 
a South Sea island, she said." 

''Ah! Now I can get a perspective. This is 
her first adventure. She isn't used to cities." 

"But how in the Lord's name was she brought 
up? There's a queer story back of this somewhere." 

The manager extended his hands at large, as if 
to deny any responsibility in the affair. "Never 
heard of a sing-song girl; never heard of a geisha! 
Flower of the Lotus: the sing-song girl called her 
that." 





"The White Hollyhock would fit her better. 
There is something sensual in the thought of lotus 
flowers. Hollyhocks make one think of a bright 
June Sunday and the way to church!" 

"Do you suppose that young fool has done 
anything?" 

The doctor shrugged. "I don't know. I shouldn't 
care to express an opinion. I ought to stay the 
night through; but I'm late now for an operation 
at the hospital. Good night." 

He departed, musing. How plainly he could see 
the patch of garden in the sunmier sunshine and 
the white hollyhocks nodding above the picket 
fence ! 

Ruth sat waiting for the half hour, subconsciously. 
Her thoughts were busy with the possibilities of 
this break in her journey. Somebody to depend 
upon her; somebody to have need of her, if only 
for a little while. In all her life no Kving thing 
had had to depend upon her, not even a dog or a 
cat. All other things were without weight or 
consequence before the fact that this poor young 
man would have to depend upon her for his life  
The amazing tonic of the thought! 

From time to time she laid her hand upon Spur- 
lock's forehead: it was still cold. But the rise of 
the chest was quite perceptible now. 

From where had he come, and why? An author! 




To her he would be no less interesting because he 
i as unsuccessful. Stories     . love stories: 
and to-morrow she would know the joy of reading 
them! It was almost unbehevable; it was too good 
to be true. It filled her with indefinable fear. 
until now none of her prayers had ever been answered. Why should God give particular attention 
to such a prayer, when He had ignored all others? 
Certainly there was a trap somewhere. 

So, while she watched, distressed and bewildered 
by her tumbling thoughts, the packet. Canton 
bound, ruffled the placid waters of the Pearl River. 
In one of the cabins a man sat on the edge of his 
narrow bunk. In his muscular pudgy hand was a 
photograph, frayed at the comers, soiled from the 
contact of many hands: the portrait of a youth 
of eighteen. 

The man was thick set, with a bright roving eye. 
The blue jaws suggested courage and tenacity. 
It was not a hard face, but it was resolute. As he 
balanced the photograph, a humorous twinkle came 
into his eyes. 

Pure luck! If the boy had grown a moustache or 
a beard, a needle in the haystack would have been 
soft work. To stumble upon the trail through the 
agency of a bottle of whisky! Drank queer; so 
his bottle had rendered him conspicuous. And 
now, only twenty-four hours behind him . . . 
that is, if he wasn't paddling by on the return route 
to Hong-Kong or had dropped down to Macao. 
But that possibility had been anticipated. He 
would have to return to Hong-Kong; and his trail 
would be picked up the moment he set foot on 
the Praya. 

Pure luck! But for that bottle of whisky, nobody in the Hong-Kong Hotel would have been 
able to identify the photograph; and at this hour 
James Boyle O'Higgins would have been on the 
way to Yokohama, and the trail lost for ever. 

Ho-hum! 


THE Hong-Kong packet lay alongside the 
warehouse frontage. Ah Cum patrolled the 
length of the boat innumerable times, but 
never letting his glance stray far from the gang- 
plank. This was automaticdly rather than thoughtfully done; habit. His mind was busy with a 
resume of yesterday's unusual events. 

The young man desperately ill and the girl taking 
care of him! Of course, there could be only one 
ending to such a bout with liquor, and that ending 
had come perhaps suddenly but not surprisingly. 
But the girl stood outside the circle of Ah Ciun's 
knowledge —  rather profound — of human impulses. 
Somehow logic could not explain her. Why should 
she trouble herself over that yoimg fool, who was 
nothing to her; who, when he eventually sobered 
up, would not be able to recognize her, or if he 
did, as something phantasmagorical? 

Perhaps he should not apply the term "fool"; "unfortunate" might be the more accurate application. 
Besides, he was a Yale man. He might be unfortunate, but he would scarcely be a fool. The Yale 
spirit! Ah Cum smiled whimsically. After fifteen 
years, to find that peculiarly Occidental attribute — 

 





college loyalty — still alive in his heart! A Western 
idea that had survived; an idea that was merely the 
flower of youthful enthusiasm! 

With his hands still in his sleeves, his chin down 
in speculation over this phenomenon, he continued 
his patrol.   

"Hey, you!" 

Ah Cum stopped and turned. Framed in one 
of the square ports of the packet was a face which 
reminded Ah Cum of a Japanese theatrical mask. 
One side of the face was white with foamy lather 
and the other ruddy-cheeked and blue-jawed. 
Speak English?" boomed the voice. 
Yes; I speak English." 

Fine! I'll be wanting a guide. Where can 
I get one?" asked O'Higgin  

"I am one." 

"All right, m be with you in a jiffy." Quarter 
of an hour later O'Higgins stepped off the gangplank. 
He carried a small bag. "This your regular busi- 
ness?" 

"For the present. Will you be wanting irie 
alone?" asked Ah Cum. "I generally taV  e a 
party." 

"What'll it cost to have you all to myself   otflic 
day?" 

Ah Cum named the sum. He smiled invitingly. 
Here was one of those Americans who would
him breathless before sundown. The boomin .-   
and the energetic movements spoke plainly of 
hurry. 

"You're on," said O'Higgins. "Now, lead me 
to a hotel where I can get breakfast. Wait a mo- 
ment. IVe got an address here." 

O'Higgins emptied an inside pocket —  and purposely let the battered photograph fall to the ground. 
He pretended to be unaware of the mishap. Po- 
litely Ah Cum stooped and recovered the photograph. 
He rose slowly and extended it. An ancient smile 
lay on his lips. 

"You dropped this, sir." 

"Oh. Thanks." O'Higgins, bitten with disappointment, returned the photograph to his pocket. 
"Victoria; that's the hotel." 

"That's but a short distance from here, sir." 

"O'Higgins is the name." 

"Mr. O'Higgins. Let me take the satchel, sir.'' 

"It's light. I'll tote it myself. Say, ever see 
any one resembling that photograph I dropped?'' 

"So many come and go," said Ah Cum, shrugging. 
"Few stay more than a day. And there are other 
guides." 

"Uh-huh. Well, let's beat it to the hotel. I'm 
hungry." 

"This way, sir." 

"What's your name?" 

Ah Cum got out his black-bordered card and 
oflFered it. 





''Aw Come. That sounds kind of funny ' said 
O'Higgins. Smiling, the Chinaman gave the correct pronunciation. "I see. Ah Coom. What's 
the idea of the black border?" 

"My father recently died, sir.'' 

"But that style isn't Oriental." 

"I was educated in America." 

"Where?" 

"At Yale." 

"Well, well! This part of the world is jammed 
full of surprises. I met a Hindu a few weeks ago 
who was a Harvard man." 

"Will you be taking a pole-chair?" 

"If that's the racket. I naturally want to do 
it up in proper style." 

"Very well, sir. I'll be outside the hotel at 
nine-thirty." 

Ten minutes' walk brought them to the hotel. 
As O'Higgins signed the hotel raster, his keen 
glance took in the latest signatures. 

"Anywhere," he said in answer to the manager's 
query. "I'm not particular about rooms. Where's 
the dining room? And, say, can I have some 
eggs? This jam-tea breakfast gets my goat." 

"Come this way, Mr. O'Higgins," said the manager, amusedly. 

O'Higgins followed him into the dining room. 
That raster would be easy to get at; comforting 
thought. It did not matter in the least what name 




 

the young fellow was travelling under; all James 
Boyle O'Higgins wanted was the letter H. There 
 ras something fatalistic about the letter H. The 
individual twist was always there, even in the 
cleverest forgeries. 

The eggs were all right, but nobody in this part 
of the world had the least conception of what the 
coffee bean was for. Always as black and bitter 
as gall. Coffee k la Turque wasn't so bad; but a 
guy couldn't soak his breakfast toast in it. 

Two women entered and sat down at the adjoining table. After a while one began to talk. 

"The manager says there is still some doubt. 
The change will come to-day. Ah Cum had no 
business taking him into the city last night. The 
young man did not know what he was doing or 
where he was." 

O'Higgins extracted a cigar from a pocket and 
inspected it. Henry Clay, thirteen cents in Hong- 
Kong and two-bits in that dear old New York. He 
would never be able to figure out that: all these miles 
from Cuba, and you could get a perf ecto for thirteen 
cents. He heard the woman talking again. 

"I feel guilty, going away and leaving that ig- 
norant child; but our days have been so planned 
that we dare not change the schedule. Didn't 
understand me when I said she would be compromised ! He won't be able to leave his bed under 
four weeks; and she said she hadn't much money. 





If she had once known him, if he were some former 
neighbour, it would be comprehensible. But an 
individual she never laid eyes on day before yester- 
day! And the minute he gets up, he'll head for 
the public bar. There's something queer about 
that young man; but we'll never be able to find 
out what it is. I don't believe his name is Taber." 

O'Higgins tore free the scarlet band of his perfecto, the end of which he bit oflP with strong white 
teeth, and smiled. You certainly had to hand it 
to these Chinks. Picked up the photograph, looked 
at it, handed it back, and never batted an eye! The 
act was as clear as daylight, but the motive was as 
profoundly mysterious as the race itself. He hadn't 
patrolled old Fell Street as a plain clothes man
