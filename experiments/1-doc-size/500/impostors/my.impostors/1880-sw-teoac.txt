to Mrs. Jersey ? It was impossible to determine , 
nevertheless Dolly felt that she must see her and 
speak to her. That was a necessity. 

Through the trees she caught at last sight of the 
grand old house. The dog knew her by this time 
and she did not fear him. She found the house- 
keeper busy with some sewing and glad to welcome 
her. Mrs. Jersey was that always. To-day she 
looked a little closer than usual at her visiter, discerning that Dolly's mind was not jiist in its wonted 
poise. And besides, she loved to look at her. 

Yet it is not easy to describe that for which our 
eyes seek and dwell upon a face or form. It is 
easy to say brown eyes and lightly curled, waving, 
beautiful hair; but hair is beautiful in different 
ways, and so faces. Can we put Dolly's charm 
into words ? Mrs. Jersey saw a delicate, graceful, 
active figure, to begin with; delicate without any 
suspicion of weakness; active in little quick, gracious movements, which it was fascinating to watch ; 
and when not in motion, lovely in its childlike unconsciousness of repose. Her hair was exceedingly 
beautiful, not on account of its mass or colour so 
much as for the great elegance of its growth and 



 

curly arrangement or disarrangement around the 
face and neck; and the face was a blending of 
womanly and childlike. It could seem by turns 
most of the one or most of the other; but the clear 
eyes had at all times a certain deep inwardness, 
along with their bright, intelligent answer to the 
moment's impression, and also a certain innocent 
outlook, which was very captivating. And then, 
at a moment's notice, Dolly's face from being grave 
and thoughtful, would dimple all up with some 
flash of fun, and make you watch its change back 
to gravity again, with an intensified sense both of 
its merry and of its serious charm. She smiled at 
Mrs. Jersey now as she came in, but the house- 
keeper saw that the eyes had more care in their 
thoughtfulness than she was accustomed to see in 
them. 

" And how is the mother, dear ? " she asked, when 
Dolly had drawn up a chair and sat down ; for they 
were grown familiar friends by this time. 

" She is not getting on much, Mrs. Jersey. I 
wanted to talk to you about her. The doctor says 
travelling would be the best thing." 

" And you will go and travel ? Where will you 
go?" 

" I don't know yet whether we can go anywhere. 
Mother wants to go." Dolly looked out hard into the 
tree groups on the lawn. They barred the vision. 

" That is one sign then that the doctor is right," 
said Mrs. Jersey. " It is good for sick folks to have 
what they like." 



 

" Isn't it good for people that are not sick ? " 

"Sometimes," said Mrs. Jersey smiling. "But 
sometimes not; or else the good Lord would let 
them have it, when he does not let them. What 
are you wanting, Miss Dolly ? " 

" I want everything different from what it is just 
now ! " said Dolly, the tears starting to her eyes. 
The housekeeper was moved with a great sympathy ; sympathy that was silent at first. 

" Can I help ? " she asked. 

" Maybe you can help with your counsel," said 
Dolly, brushing her hand over her eyes; "that is 
what I came here for to-day. I wanted to speak 
to somebody; and I have nobody but you, Mrs. 
Jersey." 

" Your mother, my dear ? " 

"I can't worry mother." 

" True. You are right. Well, my dear ? What 
do you want counsel about ? " 

"It is very difficult to tell you. I don't know if 
I can. I will try. One thing. Mrs. Jersey, is it 
right sometimes, is it a girl's duty ever, to sacrifice herself for her parents ? ". 

The housekeeper had not expected this form of 
dilemma, and hesitated a few minutes. 

" Sacrifice herself how, Miss Dolly ? " 

"Marrying, for instance." 

" Marrying somebody she does not care for ? " 

"Yes." 

" How 'for her parents'?" 

" Suppose I am just supposing, suppose he has 



 

money, and they haven't. Suppose, for instance, 
they are in difficulties, and by her sacrificing herself she can put them out of difficulty? Such a 
case might be, you know." 

"Often has been; or at least people have thought 
so. But Miss Dolly, where is a young lady's first 
duty?" 

"To God, of course; her first duty." 

"And next after God ? " 

" To her parents, I suppose." 

" And besides her parents ? " 

"I don't know; nobody, I think." 

" Let us see. She owes something to herself." 

" Does she ? " 

" And do you not think she owes something to 
the other party concerned? don't you think she 
owes something to the gentleman she is to marry?" 

" Yes of course," said Dolly slowly. " I do not 
know exactly what, though; nor exactly what she 
owes to herself." 

" Before taking any course of action, in a matter 
that is very important, shouldn't she look all round 
the subject ? and see what will become of all these 
duties ? " 

" Certainly. But the first comes first." 

"The first comes first. How does the first look 
to you ? " 

"The first is her duty to God." 

" Well. What does her duty to God say? " 

" I don't know," said Dolly very gravely. " I am 
all in a puzzle. Something in me says one thing, 



 

and something else in me cries out against it. Mrs. 
Jersey, the Bible says, ' Honour thy father and thy 
mother.'" 

"Yes, and it says, 'Children, obey your parents.' 
But the next words that come after, are 'in the 
Lord:" 

"How is that?" 

" So as you can without failing in your duty to 
him." 

" Can duties clash ? " 

"No," said the housekeeper smiling; "for, as you 
said, ' the first comes first.' " 

" I do not understand," said Dolly. " It is my 
duty to obey his word; and his word says, obey 
them." 

" Only not when their command or wish goes 
against his." 

"Well, how would this?" said Dolly. "Suppose 
they wish me to marry somebody, and my doing 
so would be very good for them ? The Bible says, 
' Love seeks not her own.' " 

" Most true," said the housekeeper, watching the 
tears that suddenly stood in Dolly's bright eyes. 
" But it says some other things." 

" What, Mrs. Jersey ? Do make it clear to me 
if you can. I am all in a muddle." 

" My dear, I am not a very good hand to explain 
what I mean. But do you not think you owe it 
both to yourself and to God, not to do what would 
blast your life ? you cannot serve him so well with 
a blasted life." 



 

"It seems to me," said Dolly, speaking slowly, 
" I have a right to give up my own happiness. I 
do not see the wrong of it." 

"In anything else," said the housekeeper. "In 
anything else, my dear ; only not in marriage ! My 
dear, it is not simply giving up one's happiness; it 
is a long torture ! No, you owe it to yourself; for 
in that way you could never grow to be what you 
might be. My dear, I have seen it tried. I have 
known a woman who married so, thinking that it 
would not matter so much; she fulfilled life's duties nobly, she was a good wife and mother and 
friend ; but when I asked her once, after she had 
told me her story, how life had been to her? I 
shall never forget how she turned to me and said, 
' It has been a hell upon earth ! ' Miss Dolly, no 
good father and mother would buy anything at such 
a price; and no man that really loved a woman 
would have her at such a price ; and so, if you follow the rule, 'Whatsoever ye would that men 
should do to you, do ye even so to them' you 
will never marry in that way." 

There was a little silence, and then Dolly said in 
an entirely changed tone, "You have cleared up 
the mist, Mrs. Jersey." 

" Then there is another thing," the housekeeper 
went on. She heard the change in Dolly's voice, 
out of which the anxiety had suddenly vanished, 
but she was willing to make assurance doubly sure. 
" Did you ever think what a woman owes to the 
man she marries ? " 



 

" I never thought about it," said Dolly. " What 
a man asks for, is that she will marry him." How 
Dolly's cheeks flamed up. But she was very serious, and the housekeeper if possible yet more so. 

" Miss Dolly, she owes him the best love of her 
heart, after that she gives to God." 

" I don't see how she can," said Dolly. " I do 
not see how she can love him so well as her father 
and mother." 

" He expects it though, and has a right to it. 
And unless a woman can give it, she cannot be a 
true wife. She makes a false vow at the altar. 
And unless she do love him so, it may easily happen that she will find somebody afterwards that 
she will like better than her husband. And then, 
all is lost." 

" After she is married ? " said Dolly. 

" Perhaps after she has been married for years. 
If she has not married the right man, she may find 
him when she cannot marry him." 

" But that is dreadful ! " cried Dolly. 

" The world is a pretty mixed-up place," said the 
housekeeper. "I want your way to be straight 
and clear, Miss Dolly." 

There was a pause again, at the end of which 
Dolly repeated, " Thank you, Mrs. Jersey. You 
have cleared up the mist for me." 

"I hear it in your voice," said her friend smiling. 
" It has got its clear sweet ring again. Is all the 
trouble disposed of?" 

"Oh no !" said Dolly, a shadow crossing her face 



 

anew; "but I am relieved of one great perplexity. 
That was not all my trouble; I cannot tell you 
all I wish I could ! One thing, I want to see 
my father dreadfully, to talk to him about mother's 
going travelling; and I cannot get sight of him. 
He stays in London. And time is flying." 

" Write " said the housekeeper. 

"I have written. And I have sent messages. 
I would go up to London myself but I cannot go 
alone." 

" Miss Dolly," said the housekeeper after a minute's thought, " perhaps I can help here too. I 
have to go up to London for a few days, and was 
thinking to go next week. If you will trust your- 
self to me, I will take you, and take care of you." 

Dolly was overjoyed at this suggestion. A lit-tle more conversation to settle preliminaries and 
particulars, and Dolly set off on her way home 
with a much lightened heart. 

" Ah me ! " thought the housekeeper as she stood 
at the door looking after her, "how hard we do 
make it for each other in this world ! " 



CHAPTER XV. 

THE CONSUL'S OFFICE. 

THEREFORE Dolly had reached home she was joined 
by Mr. St. Leger. He was still in the park. 

" Have you been for a walk ? " said he in astonished fashion. 

" I suppose that would be a natural conclusion," 
said Dolly. She spoke easily; it rejoiced her to 
find how easily she could now meet Mr. St. Leger. 
Yet the game was not all played out, either. 

" Why didn't you let me know, that I might 
go along? " he went on. 

"That was not in my purpose," rejoined Dolly 
lightly. 

" That is very unkind, Dolly." 

" Truth is never unkind." 

"Yes indeed, it may be; it is now." 

" Would you like falsehood better ? " 

"You need not be false." 

" I must be either false or true, must I not ? 
Which would you rather have, Mr. St. Leger ? " 

"It would be no good, my choosing," said he 
with a half laugh; "for you would never give me 
anything but absolute truth, I know. I believe 



 

that is one of your attractions, Dolly. All other 
girls put on something, and a fellow never can tell 
what he is served to, the dish is spiced so cleverly. 
But you are like a piece of game, with no flavour 
but your own ; and that is wild enough, and rare 
enough too." 

"Mr. St. Leger," said Dolly gravely, "you ought 
to study rhetoric.'' 

" Have. Why ? " 

" I am afraid that last speech was rather mixed 
up." 

"Look here, I wish you'd call me Lawrence. 
We know each other quite well enough." 

" Is that the custom in your country ? " 

" It is going to be your country, as well. You 
need not speak in that fashion." 

" I am thinking of leaving the country," Dolly 
went on unconcernedly. "Mother is longing to 
travel; and I am going to bring it about." 

" I have tried Mr. Copley on that subject, I assure you." 

" I shall try now, and do it." 

"Think so? Then we will consult about plans 
and routes again this evening. Mrs. Copley likes 
that almost as well as the thing itself. For Dolly, 
you cannot get along without me." 

Which assertion Dolly left uncontroverted. 

A few days after Lawrence had gone back to 
town was the time for Mrs. Jersey's journey. 
Dolly told her mother her plan ; and after a deal of 
doubts and fears and arguings on Mrs. Copley's 


part, it was finally agreed to. It seemed the hope- 
fullest thing to do; and Mrs. Copley could be left 
well enough with the servants for a few days. So 
early one morning Mrs. Jersey called for her, and 
Dolly with a beating heart kissed her mother and 
went off. 

Some business reasons occasioned the house- 
keeper to make the journey in a little covered 
carriage belonging to the house, instead of taking 
the public post coach. It was all the pleasanter 
for Dolly, being entirely private and quiet ; though 
the time consumed was longer. They were then 
in the end of summer; the weather was delicious 
and warm ; the country rich in flowers and grain 
fields and ripening i'ruit. Dolly at first was full of 
delight, the change anc^ the novelty were SO welcome, and the country through which they drove 
was so exceeding lovely. Nevertheless, as the 
day went by there began to creep over her a 
strange feeling of loneliness; a feeling of being 
out on the journey of life all by herself and left 
to her own skill and resources. It was not the 
journey to London ; for that she was well accompanied and provided; it was the real undertaking 
upon which she had set out, the goal of which 
was not London but her father. To find her 
father not only, but to keep him; to prevent his 
being lost to himself, lost to her mother, to life, 
and to her. Could she? Or was she embarked 
on an enterprize beyond her strength? A weak 
girl ; what was she, to do so much ! It grew and 


pressed upon her, this feeling of being alone and 
busy with a work too great for her; till gradually 
the lovely country, through which she was passing 
ceased to be lovely ; it might have been a wilderness, for all its cheer or promise to her. Dolly 
had talked at first, in simple, gleeful, girlish pleasure; little by little her words grew fewer, her eye 
lost its glad life; until she sat back, withdrawn 
into herself, and spoke no more unless spoken to. 

The housekeeper noticed the change, saw and 
read the abstracted, thoughtful look that had taken place of the gay, interested delight of the morning. She perceived that Dolly had serious work 
on hand, of some sort; and she longed to help her. 
For the fair, sweet, womanly thoughtfulness was 
as lofty and lovely in its way, as the childlike 
simplicity of enjoyment before had been bewitching. She was glad when the day's ride came to 
an end. 

The stoppage was made at a little wayside inn ; 
a low building of grey stone, overgrown with ivy 
and climbing roses, with a neatly kept bit of grass 
in front. Here Dolly's interest and delight awoke 
' again. This was something unlike all she had ever 
seen. Simple and plain enough the inn was; stone 
flooring and wooden furniture of heavy and ancient pattern made it that; but at the same time it 
was substantial, comfortable, neat as wax, and with 
a certain air of well-to-do thrift which was very 
pleasant. Mrs. Jersey was known here and warmly 
received. The travellers were shewn into a cosy 



 

little room, brown wainscoted, and with a great 
jar of flowers in the chimney ; and here the cloth 
was immediately laid for their dinner, or supper. 
For the supper itself they had to wait a little; and 
after putting off her bonnet and refreshing herself 
in an inner room, Dolly sat down by one of the 
small windows. The day was declining. Slant 
sunbeams shot across a wide plain and threw long 
shadows from the trees. The trees, especially those 
overhanging the inn, were old and large and fine; 
the lights and shadows were moveless, calm, peaceful; one or two neighbouring fields were stocked 
with beautiful cattle; and a flock of geese went 
waddling along over the green. It was removed 
from all the scenes of Dolly's experience; as unlike 
them as her being there alone was unlike the rest 
of her life ; in the strangeness there was this time 
an element of relief. 

" How beautiful the world is, Mrs. Jersey ! " she 
remarked. 

" You find it so here ? " answered her friend. 

" Why yes, I do. Don't you ? " 

"I suppose I am spoiled, Miss Dolly, by being
