don't you know? " Rose demanded with resentment. 



 

" I'm just going over to see." 

" Then please go ! " she replied with a nervous 
laugh. She presented to the others, as a criti 
cism of his inaction, a white, uneasy face. 

" I want first," said Tony, " to express to you 
my real joy. Please believe in it." 

She thought she seemed to come back from 
a distance. " Oh, you know ? " Then to Paul : 
" She told you ? It's a detail," she added impa 
tiently. " The question " she thought again 
" is the poor child." Once more she appealed to 
Paul. " Will you go and see ? " 

"Yes, go, boy." Tony patted his back. 

"Go this moment," his mother put in. 

He none the less lingered long enough to 
offer Rose his blind face. "I want also to ex 



press 

She took him up with a wonderful laugh. 
" Your real joy, dear Mr. Paul ? " 

"Please believe in that too." And Paul, at 
an unwonted pace, took his way. 

"I believe in everything I believe in every 
one," Rose went on. "But I don't believe " 

She hesitated, then checked herself. "No mat 
ter. Can you forgive me?" she asked of Mrs. 
Beever. 





"For giving up the child?" The lady of 
Eastmead looked at her hard. " No ! " she said 
curtly, and, turning straight away, went and 
dropped into a seat, from which she watched 
the retreating figures of her two parlour-maids, 
who carried off between them a basket contain 
ing the paraphernalia of tea. Rose, with a queer 
expression, but with her straight back to the 
painful past, quietly transferred her plea to 
Tony. "It was his coming it made the dif 
ference. It upset me." 

" Upset you ? You were splendid ! " 

The light of what had happened was in her 
face as she considered him. " You are ! " she 
replied. Then she added: "But he's finer than 
either of us ! " 

"I told you four years ago what he is. He's 
all right." 

"Yes," said Rose "he's all right. And I 
am now," she went on. "You've been good 
to me." She put out her hand. "Good-bye." 

"'Good-bye'? You're going?" 

"He takes me away." 

" But not to-night ! " Tony's native kindness, 
expressed in his inflection, felt that it could now 
risk almost all the forms he essentially liked. 



 

From the depth of Rose's eyes peeped a dis 
tracted, ironic sense of this. But she said with all 
quietude : " To-morrow early. I may not see you." 

" Don't be absurd ! " laughed Tony. 

"Ah, well if you will!" She stood a mo 
ment looking down; then raising her eyes, 
"Don't hold my hand so long," she abruptly 
said. " Mrs. Beever, who has dismissed the ser 
vants, is watching us." 

Tony had the appearance of having felt as if 
he had let it go ; but at this, after a glance at the 
person indicated, staring and smiling with a clear 
face, he retained his grasp of it. " How in the 
world, with your back turned, can you see that ? " 

"It's with my back turned that I see most. 
She's looking at us hard." 

" I don't care a hang ! " said Tony gayly. 

"Oh, I don't say it for myself!" But Rose 
withdrew her hand. 

Tony put both his own into his pockets. "I 
hope you'll let me say to you very simply - 
that I believe you'll be very happy." 

"I shall be as happy as a woman can be who 
has abandoned her post." 

" Oh, your post ! " Tony made a joke of that 
now. But he instantly added: "Your post will 





be to honour us with your company at Bounds 
again ; which, as a married woman, you see, you'll 
be perfectly able to do." 

She smiled at him. " How you arrange things ! " 
Then with a musing headshake : " We leave Eng 
land." 

" How you arrange them ! " Tony exclaimed. 
"He goes back to China?" 

" Very soon he's doing so well." 

Tony hesitated. " I hope he has made money." 

" A great deal. I should look better shouldn't 
I ? if he hadn't. But I show you enough how 
little I care how I look. I blow hot and cold; 
I'm all there then I'm off. No matter," she re 
peated. In a moment she added: "I accept your 
hopes for my happiness. It will do, no doubt, as 

soon as I learn ! " Her voice dropped for 

impatience; she turned to the quarter of the 
approach from the other house. 

" That Erne's all right? " Tony saw their mes 
senger already in the shrubbery. "Here comes 
Paul to tell us." 

Mrs. Beever rejoined them as he spoke. "It 
wasn't Paul on the bridge. It was the Doctor 
without his hat." 

" Without his hat ? " Rose murmured. 



 

" He has it in his hand," Tony cheerfully as 
serted as their good friend emerged from cover. 

But he hadn't it in his hand, and at sight of 
them on the top of the slope he stopped short, 
stopped long enough to give Rose time to call 
eagerly: "Is Effie there?" 

It was long enough also to give them all time 
to see, across the space, that his air was disor 
dered and his look at them strange ; but they had 
no sooner done so than he made a violent gesture 
a motion to check the downward rush that he 
evidently felt his aspect would provoke. It was 
so imperative that, coming up, he was with them 
before they had moved, showing them splashed, 
wet clothes and a little hard white face that Wil- 
verley had never seen. " There has been an ac 
cident." Neither had Wilverley, gathered into 
three pairs of ears, heard that voice. 

The first effect of these things was to hold it an 
instant while Tony cried: "She's hurt?" 

"She's killed?" cried Mrs. Beever. 

" Stay where you are ! " was the Doctor's stern 
response. Tony had given a bound, but, caught 
by the arm, found himself jerked, flaming red, 
face to face with Rose, who had been grabbed as 
tightly by the wrist. The Doctor closed his eyes 


 

for a second with this effort of restraint, but in 
the force he had put into it, which was not all 
of the hands, his captives submissively quivered. 
" You're not to go ! " he declared quite as if it 
were for their own good. 

"She's dead?" Tony panted. 

"Who's with her who was?" cried Rose. 

"Paul's with her by the water." 

"By the water?" Rose shrieked. 

" My child's drowned ? " Tony's shout was 
strange. 

The Doctor had been looking from one of them 
to the other ; then he looked at Mrs. Beever, who, 
instantly, admirably, with a strength quickly ac 
knowledged by the mute motion of his expressive 
little chin toward her, had stilled herself into the 
appeal of a blanched, breathless wait. " May I 
go?" sovereignly came from her. 

" Go. There's no one else," he said as she 
bounced down the bank. 

"No one else? Then where's that girl?" 
Rose's question was fierce. She gave, as fiercely, 
to free herself, a great wrench of her arm, but the 
Doctor held her as if still to spare her what he 
himself had too dreadfully seen. He looked at 
Tony, who said with quick quietness 



 

"Ramage, have I lost my child?" 
"You'll see be brave. Not yet I've told 
Paul. Be quiet ! " the Doctor repeated ; then his 
hand dropped on feeling that the movement he 
had meant to check in his friend was the vibration 
of a man stricken to weakness and sickened on 
the spot. Tony's face had turned black ; he was 
rooted to the ground ; he stared at Rose, to whom 
the Doctor said : " Who, Miss Armiger, was with 
her?" 

All her lividness wondered. " When was it 



" God knows ! She was there against the 
bridge." 

" Against the bridge where I passed just 
now? I saw nothing !" Rose jerked, while Tony 
dumbly closed his eyes. 

" I came over because she wasn't at the house, 
and from the bank there she was. I reached 
her with the boat, with a push. She might 
have been half an hour - " 

" It was half an hour ago she took her ! " Rose 
broke in. " She's not there ? " 

The Doctor looked at her hard. " Of whom do 
you speak ? " 

" Why, of Miss Martle whose hands are never 





off her." Rose's mask was the mask of Medusa. 
" What has become of Miss Martle ? " 

Dr. Ramage turned with the question to Tony, 
whose eyes, open now, were half out of his head. 
" What has become of her ? " 

"She's not there?" Tony articulated. 

"There's no one there." 

" Not Dennis ? " sprang bewilderedly from Rose. 

The Doctor stared. " Mr. Vidal ? No, thank 
God only Paul." Then pressing Tony : " Miss 
Martle was with her? " 

Tony's eyes rolled over all space. "No not 
Miss Martle." 

" But somebody was ! " Rose clamoured. " She 
wasn't alone ! " 

Tony fixed her an instant. " Not Miss Martle," 
he repeated. 

" But who then ? And where is she now ? " 

" It's positive she's not here ? " the Doctor 
asked of Rose. 

" Positive Mrs. Beever knew. Where is she ? " 
Rose rang out. 

"Where in the name ?" passed, as with 

the dawn of a deeper horror, from their companion 
to Tony. 

Tony's eyes sounded Rose's, and hers blazed 



 

back. His silence was an anguish, his face a 
convulsion. " It isn't half an hour," he at last 
brought out. 

" Since it happened ? " The Doctor blinked at 
his sudden knowledge. "Then when ?" 

Tony looked at him straight. " When I was 
there." 

"And when was that?" 

"After I called for you." 

" To leave word for me to go ? " The Doctor 
set his face. "But you weren't going home 
then." 

"I did go I had a reason. You know it," 
Tony said to Rose. 

" When you went for your paper ? " She 
thought. "But Effie wasn't there then." 

"Why not? She was there, but Miss Martle 
wasn't with her." 

"Then, in God's name, who was?" cried the 
Doctor. 

" I was," said Tony. 

Rose gave the inarticulate cry of a person who 
has been holding her breath, and the Doctor an 
equally loud, but more stupefied " You ? " 

Tony fixed upon Rose a gaze that seemed to 
count her respirations. "I was with her," he 





repeated ; " and I was with her alone. And 
what was done I did." He paused while they 
both gasped; then he looked at the Doctor. 
"Now you know." They continued to gasp; 
his confession was a blinding glare, in the shock 
of which the Doctor staggered back from Rose 
and she fell away with a liberated spring. " God 
forgive me!" howled Tony he broke now into 
a storm of sobs. He dropped upon a bench with 
his wretched face in his hands, while Rose, with 
a passionate wail, threw herself, appalled, on 
the grass, and their companion, in a colder dis 
may, looked from one prostrate figure to the other. 



BOOK THIRD 



XXVIII 

THE greatest of the parlour-maids came from 
the hall into the drawing-room at Eastmead 
the high, square temple of mahogany and tapes 
try in which, the last few years, Mrs. Beever 
had spent much time in rejoicing that she had 
never set up new gods. She had left it, from 
the first, as it was full of the old things that, 
on succeeding to her husband's mother, she had 
been obliged, as a young woman of that period, 
to accept as dolefully different from the things 
thought beautiful by other young women whose 
views of drawing-rooms, all about her, had also 
been intensified by marriage. She had not un- 
assistedly discovered the beauty of her heritage, 
and she had not from any such subtle suspicion 
kept her hands off it. She had never in her 
life taken any course with regard to any object 
for reasons that had so little to do with her 
duty. Everything in her house stood, at an 






angle of its own, on the solid rock of the disci 
pline it had cost her. She had therefore lived 
with mere dry wistfulness through the age of 
rosewood, and had been rewarded by finding 
that, like those who sit still in runaway vehicles, 
she was the only person not thrown out. Her 
mahogany had never moved, but the way people 
talked about it had, and the people who talked 
were now eager to sit down with her on every 
thing that both she and they had anciently 
thought plainest and poorest. It was Jean above 
all who had opened her eyes opened them in 
particular to the great wine-dark doors, polished 
and silver-hinged, with which the lady of East- 
mead, arriving at the depressed formula that 
they were "gloomy," had for thirty years, pru 
dently, on the whole, as she considered, shut 
out the question of taste. One of these doors 
Manning now softly closed, standing, however, 
with her hand on the knob and looking across 
as if, in the stillness, to listen at another which 
exactly balanced with it on the opposite side of 
the room. The light of the long day had not 
wholly faded, but what remained of it was the 
glow of the western sky, which showed through 
the wide, high window that was still open to 



 

the garden. The sensible hush in which Man 
ning waited was broken after a moment by a 
movement, ever so gentle, of the other door. 
Mrs. Beever put her head out of the next 
room; then, seeing her servant, closed the door 
with precautions and came forward. Her face, 
hard but overcharged, had already asked a ques 
tion. 

" Yes, Ma'am Mr. Vidal. I showed him, as 
you told me, into the library." 

Mrs. Beever thought. "It may be wanted. 
I'll see him here." But she checked the woman's 
retreat. " Mr. Beever's in his room ? " 

"No, Ma'am he went out." 

" But a minute ago ? " 

"Longer, Ma'am. After he had carried in " 

Mrs. Beever stayed the word on Manning's 
lips and quickly supplied her own. " The poor 
sick little girl yes. He went to Mr. Bream?" 

"No, Ma'am the other way." 

Mrs. Beever thought afresh. " But Miss Armi- 
ger's in?" 

" Oh, yes in her room." 

"She went straight?" 

Manning, on her side, reflected. " Yes, Ma'am. 
She always goes straight." 





" Not always," said Mrs. Beever. " But she's 
quiet there?" 

"Very quiet?" 

" Then call Mr. Vidal." While Manning obeyed 
she turned to the window and stared at the gath 
ering dusk. Then the door that had been left 
open closed again, and she faced about to Dennis 
Vidal.
