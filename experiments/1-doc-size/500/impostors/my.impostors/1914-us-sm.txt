But I did not say this. I went off, and swore 
my reporter to abstain from the "human touch"; 
and he promised, and kept his word. There 



 

appeared next morning a dignified "write-up" 
of Mrs. Douglas van Tuiver's interest in child- 
labor reform. Quoting me, it described some of 
the places she had visited, and some of the sights 
which had shocked her; it went on to tell about 
our committee and its work, the status of our bill 
in the legislature, the need of activity on the part 
of om* friends if the measure was to be forced 
through at this session. It was a splendid "boost " 
for our work, and everyone ia the office was id 
raptures over it. The social revolution was at 
hand, thought my yoimg stenographer. 

But the trouble with this business of publicity 
is that, however carefully you control your 
interviewer, you cannot control the others who use 
his material. The "afternoon men" came roimd 
for more details, and they made it clear that it was 
personal details they wanted. And when I side- 
stepped their questions, they went off and made 
up answers to suit themselves, and printed Sylvia's 
pictures, together with photographs of child- 
workers taken from our pamphlets. 

I called Sylvia up while she was dressing for 
dinner, to explain that I was not responsible for 
any of this picturesqueness. "Oh, perhaps I am 
to blame myself!" she exclaimed. "I think I 
interviewed a reporter." 

"How do you mean?" 

"A woman sent up her card — she told the foot- 
man she was a friend of mine. And I thought — 
I couldn't be sure if I'd met her — so I went and 
saw her. She said she'd met me at Mrs. Harold 



 

Cliveden's; and she began to talk to me about 
child-labor, and this and that plan she had, and 
what did I think of them — and suddenly it flashed 
over me, 'Maybe this is a reporter, playing a 
trick on me!' " 

I hiuried out before breakfast next morning 
and got all the papers, to see what this enterprising 
lady had done. There was nothing, so I reflected 
that probably she had been a "Sunday" lady. 
But then, when I reached my oflBce, the phone rang, 
and I heard the voice of Sylvia. "Mary, some- 
thing perfectly dreadful has happened!" 

"What?" I cried. 

"I can't tell you over the phone, but a certain 
person is furiously angry. Can I see you if I come 
down right away?" 



 



 

Such terrors as these were unguessed by me in 
the days of my obscurity. Uneasy lies the head 
that wears a crown — and mieasy, also, lies the 
wife of that head, and the best friend of the wife. 
I dismissed my stenographer, and spent ten or 
fifteen restless minutes imtil Sylvia appeared. 

Her story was quickly told. A couple of hours 
ago the acting-manager of Mr. van Tuiver's 
oflBce had telephoned to ask if he might call upon 
a matter of importance. He had come. Nat- 
urally, he had the most extreme reluctance to say 
anything which might seem to criticize the 
activities of Mr. van Tuiver's wife; but there was 
something in the account ia the newspapers 
which should be brought to her husband's atten- 
tion. The articles gave the names and locations 
of a mmiber of firms in whose factories it was 
alleged that Mrs. van Tuiver had found imsatis- 
factory conditions; and it happened that two of 
these fij-ms were located in premises which 
belonged to the van Tuiver Estates! 

A story coming very close to melodrama, I 
perceived. I sat, dismayed at what I had done. 
"Of course, dear girl," I said, at last, "you 
understand that I had no idea who owned these 
buildings." 

"Oh, don't say that!" exclaimed Sylvia. "I 
am the one who should have known!" 



 

Then for a long time I sat still and let her 
suffer. "Tenement sweat-shops! Little children 
in factories!" I heard her whisper. 

At last I put my hand on hers. "I tried to 
put it off for a while," I said. "But I knew it 
would have to come." 

"Think of me!" she exclaimed. "Going about 
scolding other people for the way they make their 
money! When I thought of my own, I had 
visions of palatial hotels and office-buildings — 
everything splendid and clean!" 

"Well, my dear, you've learned now, and you 
win be able to do something " 

She turned upon me suddenly, and for the first 
time I saw ia her face the passions of tragedy. 
"Do you believe I will be able to do anything? 
No! Don't have any such idea!" 

I was struck dumb. She got up and began to 
pace the room. "Oh, don't make any mistake, 
I've paid for my great marriage in the last hour 
or two. To think that he cares about nothing 
save the possibility of being found out and made 
ridiculous! All his friends have been 'muck- 
raked,' as he calls it, and he has sat aloft and 
smiled over their plight; he was the landed 
gentleman, the true aristocrat, whom the worries 
of traders and money-changers didn't concern. 
Now perhaps he's caught, and his name is to be 
dragged in the mire, and it's my flightiness my 
lack of common-sense that has done it!" 

"I shouldn't let that trouble me," I said. 
"You could not know " 



 

"Oh, it's not that! It's that I hadn't a single 
courageous word to say to him — not a hint that 
he ought to refuse to wring blood-money from 
sweat-shops! I came away without having done 
it — because I couldn't face his anger — because it 
would have meant a quarrel!" 

"My dear," I said, gently, "it is possible to 
smrvive a quarrel." 

"No, you don't understand! We should never 
make it up again, I know — I saw it in his words, 
in his face. He will never change to please me 
— no — not even a simple thing like the business- 
methods of the van Tuiver Estates." 

I could not help smiling. "My dear Sylvia! 
A simple thing!" 

She came and sat beside me. "That's what I 
want to talk about. It is time I was growing 
up. It is time I knew about these things. 
Tell me about them." 

"What, my dear?" 

"About the methods of the van Tuiver Estates, 
that can't be changed to please me. I made out 
one thing — vre had recently paid a fine for some 
infraction of the law in one of those buildings; 
and my husband said it was because we had 
refused to pay more money to a tenement-house 
inspector. I asked him, 'Why should we pay 
any money at all to a tenement-house inspector? 
Isn't it bribery?' He answered, 'It's a custom — 
the same as you give a tip to a hotel-waiter.' Is 
that true?" 

I could not help smiling. "Your husband 
ought to know, my dear," I said. 



 

I saw her compress her lips. "What is the tip 
for?" 

"I suppose it is to keep out of trouble with 
him." 

"But why can't we keep out of trouble by 
obeying the law?" 

"My dear, sometimes the law is inconvenient, 
and sometimes it is comphcated and obsciu-e. 
It might be that you are violating it without 
knowing the fact. It might be imcertain whether 
you are violating it or not, so that to settle the 
question would mean a lot of expense and publicity. 
It might even be that the law is impos- 
sible to obey — that it was not intended to be 
obeyed." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"I mean, maybe it was passed to put you at 
the mercy of the pohticians." 

"But," she protested, "that would be black- 
mail!" 

"The phrase," I replied, "is 'strike-legisla- 
tion'. " 

"But at least — that wouldn't be our fault!" 

"No — not imless you had begun it. It gen- 
eraMy happens that the landlord discovers it's a 
good thing to have politicians who will work with 
him. Maybe he wants his assessments lowered; 
maybe he wants to know where new car-lines are 
to go, so that he can buy intelhgently; maybe he 
wants the city to improve his neighborhood; 
maybe he wants influence at court when he has 
some heavy damage-suit." 



 

"So we bribe everyone!" 

"Not necessarily. You may simply wait until 
campaign-time, and then make your contribution 
to the machine. That is the basis of the 
'System'." 

"The 'System'?" 

"A semi-criminal police-force, and everything 
that pays tribute to it: the saloon and the dive, 
the gambling-hell, the white-slave market — and 
the Arson trust." 

I saw a wild look in her eyes. "Tell me, do 
you know that all these things are true? Or are 
you only guessing about them?" 

"My dear Sylvia," I answered, "you said it 
was time you grew up. For the present I will tell 
you this: Several months before I met you, I 
made a speech in which I named some of the 
organized forces of evil in the city. One was 
Tammany Hall, and another was the Traction 
Trust, and another was the Trinity Church 
Corporation, and yet another was the van Tuiver 
Estates." 



 



 

The following Sunday there appeared a 
"magazine story" of an interview with the 
infinitely beautiful yoimg wife of the infinitely 
rich Mr. Douglas van Tuiver, in which the views 
of the wife on the subject of child-labor were 
hberally interlarded with descriptions of her 
reception-room and her morning-gown. But 
mere picturesqueness by that time had been 
pretty well discounted in our minds. So long as 
the article did not say anything about the owner- 
ship of child-labor tenements! 

I did not see Sylvia for several weeks after 
that. I took it for granted that she would want 
some time to get herself together and make up 
her mind about the future. I did not feel 
anxious; the seed had sprouted, and I felt siire it 
would continue to grow. 

Then one day she called me up, asking if I 
could come to see her. I suggested that after- 
noon, and she said she was having tea with some 
people at the Palace Hotel, and could I come 
there just after tea-time? I remember the place 
and the hour, because of the curious adventure 
into which I got myself. One hears the saying, 
when unexpected encoxmters take place, "How 
small the world is!" But I thought the world 
was growing really too small when I went into a 
hotel tea-room to wait for Sylvia, and foimd 
myself face to face with Claire Lepage! 



 

The place appointed had been the "orange- 
room;" I stood in the door-way, sweeping the 
place with my eyes, and I saw Mrs. van Tuiver 
at the same moment that she saw me. She was 
sitting at a table with several other people, and 
she nodded, and I took a seat to wait. From my 
position I could watch her, in animated conversa- 
tion; and she could send me a smile now and 
then. So I was decidedly startled when I heard 
a voice, "Why, how do you do?" and looked up 
and saw Claire holding out her hand to me. 

"Well, for heaven's sake!" I exclaimed. 

"You don't come to see me any more," she 
said. 

"Why, no — no, I've been busy of late." So 
much I managed to ejaculate, in spite of my 
confusion. 

"You seem surprised to see me," she remarked 
— observant as usual, and sensitive to other 
people's attitude to her. 

"Why, naturally," I said. And then, recollect- 
ing that it was not in the least natiu'al — since she 
spent a good deal of her time in such places — I 
added, "I was looking for some one else." 

"May I do in the meantime?" she inquired, 
taking a seat beside me. "What are you so 
busy about?" 

"My child-labor work," I answered. Then, 
in an instant, I was sorry for the words, thinking 
she must have read about Sylvia's activities. I 
did not want her to know that I had met Sylvia, 
for it would mean a flood of questions, which I 



 

did not want to answer — nor yet to refuse to 
answer. 

But my fear was needless. "I've been out of 
town," she said. 

"Whereabouts?" I asked, making conversation. 

"A little trip to Bermuda." 

My mind was busy with the problem of getting 
rid of her. It would be intolerable to have 
Sylvia come up to us; it was intolerable to know 
that they were in sight of each other. 

Even as the thought came to me, however, I 
saw Claire start. "Look!" she exclaimed. 

"What is it?" 

"That woman there — in the green velvet! 
The fourth table." 

"I see her." 

"Do you know who she is?" 

"Who?" (I remembered Lady Dee's maxim 
about Ijong!) 

"Sylvia Castleman!" whispered Claire. (She 
always referred to her thus — seeming to say 
"I'm as much van Tuiver as she is!") 

"Are you sure?" I asked — lq order to say 
something. 

"I've seen her a score of times. I seem to be 
always running into her. That's Freddie Atkins 
she's talking to." 

"Indeed!" said I. 

"I know most of the men I see her with. But 
I have to walk by as if I'd never seen them. A 
queer world we live in, isn't it?" 

I could assent cordially to that proposition. 



"listen," I broke in, quickly. "Have you got 
anything to do? If not, come down to the 
Royalty and have tea with me." 

"Why not have it here?" 

"I've been waiting for some one from there, and 
I have to leave a message. Then I'll be free." 

She rose, to my vast relief, and we walked out. 
I could feel Sylvia's eyes following me; but I 
dared not try to send her a message — I would 
have to make up some explanation afterwards. 
"Who was your  well-dressed friend?" I could 
imagine her asking; but my mind was more 
concerned with the vision of what would happen 
if, in full sight of her companion, Mr. Freddie 
Atkins, she were to rise and walk over to Claire 
and myself! 



 



 

Seated in the "palm-room" of the other hotel, 
I sipped a cup of tea which I felt I had earned, 
while Claire had a little glass of the fancy-colored 
Hquids which the ladies in these places affect. 
The room was an aviary, with tropical plants and 
splashing fomitains — and birds of many gorgeous 
hues; I gazed from one to another of the splendid 
creatures, wondering how many of them were 
paying for their plumage in the same way as my 
companion. It would have taken a more prac- 
ticed eye than mine to say which, for if I had been 
asked, I would have taken Claire for a diplomat's 
wife. She had not less than a thousand dollars 
worth of raiment upon her, and its style made 
clear to all the world the fact that it had not 
been saved over from a previous season of pros- 
perity. She was a fine creature, who could 
carry any amount of sail; with her bold, black 
eyes she looked thoroiyhly competent, and it 
was hard to beheve in the fundamental softness 
of her character. 

I sat, looking about me, annoyed at having 
missed Sylvia, and only half listening to Claire. 
But suddenly she brought me to attention. 
"Well," she said, "I've met him." 

"Met whom?" 

"Douglas." 

I stared at her. "Douglas van Tuiver?" 



 



She nodded; and I suppressed a cry. 

"I told you he'd come back," she added, with 
a laugh. 

"You mean he came to see you?" 

I could not hide my concern. But there was 
no need to, for it flattered Claire's vanity. "No 
— not yet, but he will. I met him at Jack 
Taylor's — at a supper-party." 

"Did he know you were to be there?" 

"No. But he didn't leave when he saw me." 

There was a pause. I could not trust myself 
to say anything. But Claire had no intention of 
leaving me curious. "I don't think he's happy
