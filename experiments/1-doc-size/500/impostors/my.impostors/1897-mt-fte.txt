It was my heart's delight 
To compose on a sentimental subject 

If it came in my mind just right.*

stanza. 



Baroda. Arrived at 7 this morning. The dawn was just 
beginning to show. It was forlorn to have to turn out in a 
strange place at such a time, and the blinking lights in the 
station made it seem night still. But the gentlemen who had 
come to receive us were there with their servants, and they 
make quick work ; there was no lost time. We were soon out- 
side and moving swiftly through the soft gray light, and 
presently were comfortably housed — with more servants to 
help than we were used to, and with rather embarassingly im- 
portant officials to direct them. But it was custom; they 
spoke Ballarat English, their bearing was charming and hospit- 
able, and so all went well. 

Breakfast was a satisfaction. Across the lawns was visible 
in the distance through the open window an Indian well, with 
two oxen tramping leisurely up and down long inclines, draw- 
ing water ; and out of the stillness came the suffering screech 
of the machinery — not quite musical, and yet soothingly 
melancholy and dreamy and reposeful — a wail of lost spirits, 
one might imagine. And commemorative and reminiscent, 
perhaps ; for of course the Thugs used to throw people down 
that well when they were done with them. 

After breakfast the day began, a sufficiently busy one. 
We were driven by winding roads through a vast park, with 
noble forests of great trees, and with tangles and jungles of 
lovely growths of a humbler' sort ; and at one place three large 
gray apes came out and pranced across the road — a good deal 
of a surprise and an unpleasant one, for such creatures belong 
in the menagerie, and they look artificial and out of place in 
a wilderness. 

We came to the city, by and by, and drove all through it. 
Intensely Indian, it was, and crumbly, and mouldering, and 
imraemorially old, to all appearance. And the houses — oh, 
indescribably quaint and curious they were, with their fronts 



an elaborate lace- work of intricate and beautiful wood-carving, 
and now and then further adorned with rude pictures of 
elephants and princes and gods done in shouting colors ; and 
all the ground floors along these cramped and narrow lanes 
occupied as shops — shops unbelievably small and impossibly 
packed with merchantable rubbish, and with nine-tenths-naked 
natives squatting at their work of hammering, pounding, braz- 
ing, soldering, sewing, designing, cooking, measuring out 
grain, grinding it, repairing idols — and then the swarm of 
ragged and noisy humanity under the horses' feet and every- 
where, and the pervading reek and fume and smell ! It was 
all wonderful and delightful. 

Imagine a file of elephants marching through such a crevice 
of a street and scraping the paint off both sides of it with their 
hides. How big they must look, and how little they must 
make the houses look ; and when the elephants are in their 
glittering court costume, what a contrast they must make with 
the humble and sordid surroundings. And when a mad 
elephant goes raging through, belting right and left with his 
trunk, how do these swarms of people get out of the way ? 
I suppose it is a thing which happens now and then in the mad 
season (for elephants have a mad season). 

I wonder how old the town is. There are patches of build- 
ing — massive structures, monuments, apparently — that are so 
battered and worn, and seemingly so tired and so burdened 
with the weight of age, and so dulled and stupefied with try- 
ing to remember things they forgot before history began, that 
they give one the feeling that they must have been a part of 
orig-inal Creation. This is indeed one of the oldest of the 
princedoms of India, and has always been celebrated for its 
barbaric pomps and splendors, and for the wealth of its 
princes. 




A MAD SEASON. 




CHAPTER XLY. 



It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to the 
heart ; the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you. — PudtVnhead 
WUsoHs New Calendar. 

OUT of the town again ; a long drive through open coun- 
try, by winding roads among secluded villages nest- 
ling in the inviting shade of tropic vegetation, a Sab- 
bath stillness everywhere, sometimes 
a pervading sense of solitude, but 
always barefoot natives gliding by 
like spirits, without 
sound of footfall, and 
others in the distance 
dissolving away and 
vanishing like the 
creatures of dreams. 
Now and then a 
string of stately 
camels passed by — 
always interesting things to look 
at — and they were velvet-shod by 
nature, and made no noise. Indeed, 
there were no noises of any sort in 
this paradise. Yes, once there was one, for a moment : a file of 
native convicts passed along in charge of an oificer, and we 
caught the soft clink of their chains. In a retired spot, resting 
himself under a tree, was a holy person — a naked black 
fakeer, thin and skinny, and whitey-gray all over with ashes. 

By and by to the elephant stables, and I took a ride ; but 
it was by request — I did not ask for it, and didn't want it ; 
but I took it, because otherwise they would have thought I 
was afraid, which I was. The elephant kneels down, by com- 
mand — one end of him at a time — and you climb the ladder 
and get into the howdah, and then he gets up, one end at a 
time, just as a ship gets up over a wave ; and after that, as he 
strides monstrously about, his motion is much like a ship's 
motion. The mahout bores into the back of his head with a 
great iron prod and you wonder at his temerity and at the 
elephant's patience, and you think that perhaps the patience 
will not last ; but it does, and nothing happens. The mahout 
talks to the elephant in a lo voice all the time, and the ele- 
phant seems to understand it all and to be pleased with it ; and 
he obeys every order in the most contented and docile way. 
Among these twenty-five elephants were two which were 
larger than any I had ever seen before, and if I had thought I 
could learn to not be afraid, I would have taken one of them 
while the police were not looking. 

In the howdah-house there were many howdahs that were 
made of silver, one of gold, and one of old ivory, and equipped 
with cushions and canopies ,of rich and costly stuffs. The 
wardrobe of the elephants was there, too ; vast velvet covers 
stiff and heavy with gold embroidery ; and bells of silver and 
gold ; and ropes of these metals for fastening the things on — 
harness, so to speak ; and monster hoops of massive gold for 
the elephant to wear on his ankles when he is out in procession 
on business of state. 

But we did not see the treasury of crown jewels, and that 
was a disappointment, for in mass and richness it ranks only 
second in India. By mistake we we taken to see the new pal- 
ace instead, and we used up the last remnant of our spare time 
there. It was a pity, too ; for the new palace is mixed modern 
American-European, and has not a merit except costliness. It 
is wholly foreign to India, and impudent and out of place. 
The architect has escaped. This comes of overdoing the sup- 
pression of the Thugs ; they had their merits. The old palace 
is oriental and charming, and in consonance with the country. 
The old palace would still be great if there were nothing of it 
but the spacious and lofty hall where the durbars are held. It 
is not a good place to lecture in, on account of the echoes, but 
it is a good place to hold durbars in and regulate the affairs of 
a kino-dom, and that is what it is for. If I had it I would have 
a durbar every day, instead of once or twice a year. 

The prince is an educated gentleman. His culture is Euro- 
pean. He has been in Europe five times. People say that 
this is costly amusement for him, since in crossing the sea he 
must sometimes be obliged to drink water from vessels that 
are more or less public, and thus damage his caste. To get it 
purified again he must make pilgrimage to some renowned 
Hindoo temples and contribute a fortune or two to them. His 
people are like the other Hindoos, profoundly religious ; and 
they could not be content with a master who was impure. 

"We failed to see the jewels, but we saw the gold cannon and 
the silver one — they seemed to be six-pounders. They were 
not designed for business, but for salutes upon rare and partic- 
ularly important state occasions. An ancestor of the present 
Gaikwar had the silver one made, and a subsequent ancestor 
had the gold one made, in order to outdo him. 

This sort of artillery is in keeping with the traditions of 
Baroda, which was of old famous for style and show. It used 
to entertain visiting rajahs and viceroys with tiger-fights, elephant-fights, 
illuminations, and elephant-processions of the 
most glittering and gorgeous character. 

It makes the circus a pale, poor thing. 

In the train, during a part of the return journey from 
Baroda, we had the company of a gentleman who had with 
him a remarkable looking dog. I had not seen one of its kind 
before, as far as I could remember ; though of course I might 
have seen one and not noticed it, for I am not acquainted with 
dogs, but only with cats. This dog's coat was smooth and 
shiny and black, and I think it had tan trimmings around the 
edges of the dog, and perhaps underneath. It 
was a long, low dog, with very short, strange 
leos — leos that  .- 

curved inboard, 
something like 
p arentheses 
turned the* 
wrong way (. 

Indeed, it was made on the plan of a bench for length and lowness. It 
seemed to be satisfied, but I thought the plan poor, and struct- 
urally weak, on account of the distance between the forward 
supports and those abaft. With age the dog's back was likely 
to sag ; and it seemed to me that it would have been a stronger 
and more practicable dog if ' it had had some more legs. It 
had not begun to sag yet, but the shape of the legs showed 
that the undue weight imposed upon them was beginning to 
tell. It had a long nose, and floppy ears that hung down, and 
a resigned expression of countenance. I did not like to ask 
what kind of a dog it was, or how it came to be deformed, for 
it was plain that the gentleman was very fond of it, and natu- 
rally he could be sensitive about it. From delicacy I thought 
it best not to seem to notice it too much. No doubt a man 
with a dog like that feels just as a person does who has a child 
that is out of true. The gentleman was not merely fond of 
the dog, he was also proud of it — just the same again, as a 
mother feels about her child when it is an idiot. I could see that 
he was proud of it, notwithstanding it was such a long dog and 
looked so resigned and pious. It had been all over the world 
with him, and had been pilgriming like that for years and 
years. It had traveled 50,000 miles by sea and rail, and had 
ridden in front of him on his horse 8,000. It had a silver 
medal from the Geographical Society of Great Britain for its 
travels, and I saw it. It had won prizes in dog shows, both in 
India and in England — I saw them. He said its pedigree was 
on record in the Kennel Club, and that it was a well-known 
dog. He said a great many people in London could recognize 
it the moment they saw it. I did not say anything, but I did 
not think it anything strange ; I should know that dog again, 
myself, yet I am not careful about noticing dogs. He said 
that when he walked along in London, people often stopped 
and looked at the dog. Of course I did not say- anything, for 
I did not want to hurt his feelings, but I could have explained 
to him that if you take a great long low dog like that and 
waddle it along the street anywhere in the world and not 
charge anything, people will stop and look. He was gratified 
because the dog took prizes. But that was nothing ; if I were 
built like that I could take prizes myself. I wished I knew 
what kind of a dog it was, and what it was for, but I could not 
very well ask, for that would show that I did not know. Not 
that I want a dog like that, but only to know the secret of its 
birth. 

I think he was going to hunt elephants with it, because I 
know, from remarks dropped by him, that he has hunted large 
game in India and Africa, and likes it. But I think that if he 
tries to hunt elephants with it, he is going to be disappointed. 

I do not believe that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, 
it lacks force of character, it lacks bitterness. These things all 
show- in the meekness and resignation of its expression. It 
would not attack an elephant, I am sure of it. It might not 
run if it saw one coming, but it looked to me like a dog that 
would sit down and praj. 

I wish he had told me what breed it was, if there are 
others ; but I shall know the dog next time, and then if I can 
bring myself to it I will put delicacy aside and ask. If I seem 
strangely interested in dogs, I have a reason for it ; for a dog 
saved me from an embarrassing position once, and that has 
made me grateful to these animals ; and if by study I could 
learn to tell some of the kinds from the others, I should be 
greatly pleased. I only know one kind apart, yet, and that is 
the kind that saved me that time. I always know that kind 
when I meet it, and if it is hungry or lost I take care of it. 
The matter happened in this way : 

It was years and years ago. I had received a note from 
Mr. Augustin Daly of the Fifth Avenue Theatre, asking me to 
call the next time I should be in New York. I was writing 
plays, in those days, and he was admiring them and trying to 
get me a chance to get them played in Siberia. I took the first 
train — the early one — the one that leaves Hartford at 8.29 in 
the morning. At New Haven I bought a paper, and found it 
filled with glaring display-liries about a " bench-show " there. 
I had often heard of bench-shows, but had never felt any inter- 
est in them, because I supposed they were lectures that were 
not well attended. It turned out, now, that it was not that, 
but a dog-show. There was a double-leaded column about the 
king-feature of this one, which was called a Saint Bernard, and 
was worth $10,000, and was known to be the largest and finest 
of his species in the world. I read all this with interest, 
because out of my school-boy readings I dimly remembered 

how the priests and pilgrims of St. Bernard used to go out in 
the storms and dig these dogs out of the snowdrifts when lost 
and exhausted, and give them brandy and save their lives, and 
drag them to the monastery and restore them with gruel. 

Also, there was a picture of this prize-dog in the paper, a 
noble great creature with a benignant countenance, standing by 
a table. He was placed in that way so that one could get 
a right idea of his great dimensions. You could see that he 
was just a shade higher than the table — indeed, a huge fellow 
for a dog. Then there was a description which went into the 
details. It gave his enormous weight — 150 pounds, and his 
length — 4 feet 2 inches, from stem to stern-post; and his 
height — 3 feet 1 inch, to the top of his back. The pictures 
and the figures so impressed me, that I could see the beautiful 
colossus before me, and I kept on thinking about him for the 
next two hours ; then I reached New York, and he dropped 
out of my mind. 

In the swirl and tumult of the hotel lobby I ran across Mr. 
Daly's comedian, the late James Lewis, of beloved memory, 
and I casually mentioned that I was going to call upon Mr. 
Daly in the evening at 8. He looked surprised, and said he 
reckoned not. For answer I handed him Mr. Daly's note. 
Its substance was : " Come to my private den, over the theater, 
where we cannot be interrupted. And come by the back way, 
not the front. No. 642 Sixth Avenue is a cigar shop; pass 
through it and you are in a paved court, with high buildings 
all around ; enter the second door on the left, and come up 
stairs." 

" Is this all ? " 

" Yes," I said. 

" Well, you'll never get in." 

"Why?" 

*' Because you won't. Or if you do you can draw on me 


for a hundred dollars ; for you will be the first man that has 
accomplished it in twenty-five years. I can't think what Mr. 
Daly can have been absorbed in. lie has forgotten a most 
important detail, and he will feel humiliated in the morning 
when he finds that you tried to get in and couldn't." 

" Why, what* is the trouble ? " 

"I'll tell you. You see — " 

At that point we were swept apart by the crowd, somebody 
detained me with a moment's talk, and we did not get together 
again. But it did not matter; I believed he was joking, any- 
way. 

At eight in the evening I passed through the cigar shop and 
finto the court and knocked at the second door. 

" Come in ! " 

I entered. It was a small room, carpetless, dusty, with a 
naked deal table, and two cheap wooden chairs for furniture, 
A giant Irishman was standing there, with shirt collar and vest 
unbuttoned, and no coat on. I put my hat on the table, and 
was about to say something, when the Irishman took the 
innings himself. And not with marked courtesy of tone : 

" Well, sor, what will you have ? " 

I was a little disconcerted, and my easy confidence suffered 
a shrinkage. The man stood as motionless as Gibraltar, and 
kept his unblinking eye upon me. It was very embarrassing, 
very humiliating. I stammered at a false start or two; then — 

" I have just run down from — " 

"Aw ye plaze, ye'll not smoke here, ye understand." 

I laid my cigar on the window-ledge ; chased my flighty 
thoughts a moment, then said in a placating manner : — 

"I — I have come to see Mr. Daly." 

" Oh, ye haA)e, have ye ? " 

"Yes." 


" "Well, ye'll not see him." 
" But he asked me to come." 
" Oh, he did, did he ? " 
" Yes, he sent me this note, and — " 
" Lemme see it." 

For a moment I fancied there would be a change in the 
atmosphere, now ; but this idea was premature. The big man 

was examining the note 
searchingly under the gas- 
jet. A glance showed me 
that he had it upside down 
— disheartening evidence 
that he could not read. 

" Is ut his own hand- 
write ? " 

" Yes — he wrote it him- 
self." 

"He did, did he?" 
" Yes." 

"H'm. Well, then, why 
ud he write it like that? " 
" How do you mean ? " 
" I mane, why wudn't he put his name to ut ? " 
" His name is to it. Thafs not it — 3ou are looking at ony 
name." 

I thought that that was a home shot, but he did not betray 
that he had been hit. He said : 

" It's not an aisy one to spell ; how do you pronounce ut ? " 
" Mark Twain." 

"Hm. H'm. Mike Train. H'm. I don't remember ut. 
"What is it ye want to see him about ? " 

" It isn't I that want to see him, he wants to see m." 
" Oh, be does, does he ? " 

"he had it upside down. 


« Yes." 

" What does he want to see ye about ?" 

" I don't know." 

" Ye don't know ! And ye confess it, becod ! Well, I can 
tell ye wan thing — ye'll not see him. Are ye in the business ? " 

" What business ? " 

" The show business." 
. A fatal question. I recognized that I was defeated. If I 
answered no, he would cut the matter short and wave me to 
the door without the grace of a word — I saw it in his uncom- 
promising eye ; if I said I was a lecturer, he would despise me, 
and dismiss me with opprobrious words ; if I said I was a 
dramatist, he would throw me out of the window. I savy that 
my case was hopeless, so I chose the course which seemed 
least humiliating: I would pocket my shame and glide out 
without answering. The silence was growing lengthy. 

" I'll ask ye again. Are ye in the show business yerself ? " 

"Yes!" 

I said it with splendid confidence ; for in that moment the 
very twin of that grand New Haven dog loafed into the room, 
and I saw that Irishman's qq light eloquently with pride and 
affection. 

" Ye are ? And what is it ?" 

"I've got a bench-show in New Haven." 

The weather did change then. 

" You don't say, sir ! And that's your show, sir ! Oh, it's 
a grand show, it's a wonderful show, sir, and a proud man I 
am to see your honor this day. And ye'll be an expert, -sir, 
and ye'll know all about dogs — more than ever they know 
theirselves, I'll take me oath to ut." 

I said, with modesty — 

" I believe I have some reputation that way. In fact, my 
business requires it." 


" Ye have some reputation, your honor ! Bedad I believe 
you ! There's not a jintleraan in the worrld that can lay over 
ye in the judgmint of a dog, sir. Now I'll vinture that your 
honor'll know that dog's dimensions there better than he knows 
them his own self, and just by the casting of your educated eye 
upon him. Would you mind giving a guess, if ye'll be so good ? " 

I knew that upon my answer would depend my fate. If I 
made this dog bigger than the prize-dog, it would be bad 
diplomacy, and suspicious ; if I fell too far short of the prize- 
dog, that would be equally damaging. The dog was standing 
by the table, and I believed I knew the difference between him 
and the one whose picture I had seen in the newspaper to a 
shade. I «poke promptly up and said —
