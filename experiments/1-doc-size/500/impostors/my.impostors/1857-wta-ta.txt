" I never had any one to care whether I was good 
or Lad. If you do, you will be the first one." 

The little girl looked sad. She had a father and 
mother who loved her, and prayed for her every day 
It seemed hard that poor Harry should nave no 
mother to love him as her mother loved her ; to 
watch over him day and night, to take care of him 
when he was sick, and, above all, to teach him to be 
good. She pitied the lonely orphan, and would glad- 
ly have taken him to her happy home, and shared 
with him all she had, even the love of her mother. 

" Poor boy ! " she sighed. " But I have been 
thinking of something," she added, in more sprightly 
tones. 

" What, Julia ? " 

" If you would only let me tell my father that you 
are here " 

" Not for the world ! " cried Harry. 

" O, I won't say a word, unless you give me leave; 
out my father is rich.  He owns a great factory and 
a great farm. He has lots of men to work for him : 
and my father is a very good man, too. People will 
do  he wants them to do, ai d if you will let me 




tell him your story, he will go over to Red field and 
make them let you stay at our house. You shall ba 
oi' hi other then, and we can do lots of things together. Do let me tell him." 

" I don't think it would be safe. I know Squire 
Walker wouldn't let me go to any place where they 
would use me well." 

" What a horrible man he must be ! " 

" No ; I think I will go on to Boston." 

" You will have a very hard time of it." 

"No matter for that." 

" They may catch you." 

" If they do, I shall try again." 

" If they do catch you, will you let my fathei 
know it? He will be your friend, for my friends aie 
his friends." 

' I will, I should be very glad to have such i 
fiieml." 

" There is our dinner bell !" said Julia, as Harry 
heard the distant sound. " I must go home, liow 
I wish you were going with me ! " 

" I wish I was. I may never see you again," &dd» 
ed Harry, sadly 


 

" O, you must see me again ! "When you get big 
you must come to Kockville." 

" You will not wish to see the little poorhouse 
boy, then." 

" Won't I ? I shall always be glad to see the boy 
that killed that snake ! But I shall come up after 
linner, and bring you something to eat. Do let me 
tell mother you are here." 

" I would rather you wouldn't." 

" Suppose she asks me what I am going to do wi\h 
the dinner I shall bring you ? I can't tell a lie." 

" Don't bring any, then. I would rather not have 
any dinner than have you tell a lie." 

Harry would not always have been so nice about 
a lie ; but for the little angel to tell a falsehood, why, 
it seemed like mud on a white counterpane. 

" I won't tell a lie, but you shall have your dinner. 
I suppose I must go now." 

Hany watched the retreating form of his kind 
friend, till she disappeared beyond the curve of tte 
pa til, and his blessing went with her. 







CHAPTER X. 

in WHICH HARRY FARES SUMPTUOUSLY, AND 
TAKES LEAVE OF THE LITTLE ANGEL. 

When Harry could no longer see the little angel, 
lie fixed his eyes upon the ground, and continued to 
think of her. It is not every day that a pauper boy 
Bees an angel, or even one whom the enthusiasm of 
the imagination invests with angelic purity and an- 
gelic affections. 

In the records of individual experience, as well as 
in the history of the world, there are certain points 
nf time which are rendered memorable by important 
events. By referring to a chronological table, the 
young reader will see the great events which have 
nraiked the progress of civilized nations from the 
lowest depths of barbarism up to their present en- 
lightened state. Every individual, if he had the 
requisite wisdom, could make up a list of epochs in 



ais own experience. Perhaps he v/ouH dtt&ch to<j 
little importance to some things, too much to others ; 
for wo cannot always clearly perceive the influences 
which assist in forming the character. Some trivial 
event, far back in the past, which inspired him with 
new reverence for truth and goodness, may be fur- 
gotten. The memory may not now cherish the look, 
the smile of approbation, which strengthened the 
heart, when it was struggling against the foe without 
or the foe within ; but its influence was none the 
less potent. " It is the last pound which breaks tie 
camel's back ; " and that look, that smile, may have 
closed the door of the heart against a whole legion 
of evil spirits, and thus turned a life of woe and bit- 
terness into a life of sunshine and happiness. 

There are hundreds of epochs in the experience 
of every person, boy or man — events which raised 
him up or let him down in the scale of moral exist- 
ence. Harry West had now reached one of these 
epochs in his pilgrimage. 

To meet a little girl in the woods, to kill a black 
snake, and thus relieve her from a terrible fright, to 
lag the least, was not a great ever.t, as events  




reckoned in the world ; yet it was destined to exert 
a powerful influence upon his future career. It was 
not the magnitude of the deed performed, or the 
chivalrous spirit which called it forth, that made this 
a memorable event to Harry ; it was the angel visit 
— the kindling influence of a pure heart that passed 
from her to him. But I suppose the impatient 
reader will not thank me for moralizing over two 
whole pages, and I leave the further application of 
the moral to the discretion of my young friends. 

Harry felt strangely — more strangely than he had 
ever felt before. As he walked back to the cabin, 
every thing seemed to have assumed a new appear- 
ance. Somehow the trees did not look as they used 
to look. He saw through a different medium. His 
being seemed to have undergone a change. He 
could not account for it ; perhaps he did not try. 

He entered the cabin ; and, without dropping the 
train of thought which Julia's presence suggested, he 
busied himself in making the place more comfortable. 
He shook up the straw, and made his bed, stuffed 
dried glass into the chinks and crannies in the roof
fastened the dor up with some buch withes, and 





replaced some of the stones of the chimney 'which 
had fallen down. This work occupied him for nearly 
two hours, though, so busy were his thoughts, they 
earned not more than half an hour. 

He had scarcely finished making these necessary 
repairs before he heard the light step of her who fed 
him, as Elijah was fed by the ravens, for it seemed 
ake a providential supply. She saw him at the door 
of the cabin ; and she no longer dallied with a walk, 
but ran with all her might. 

" O Harry, I am so glad! " she cried, out of breath, 
as she handed him a little basket, whose contents 
were carefully covered with a piece of brown paper. 

" Glad of what, Julia ? " asked Harry, smiling 
from sympathy with her. 

" I have heard all about it ; and I am so glad you 
are a good boy ! " exclaimed she, panting like a 
pretty fawn which has gambolled its breath away, 

" About what ? " 

" Father has seen and talked with — who was 
he?" 

Harry laughed. How could he tell whom hei 
father hal seen and talked with? He was not a 
Viagician. 





" The man that owned the dog, and the horse, and 
the boat." 

" ! George Leman," replied Harry, now deeply 
interested in the little maiden's story. " Where 
did he see him ? " 

" Over at the store. But I have brought you 
some dinner ; and while you are eating it, I will tell 
you all about it. Come, there is a nice big rock — - 
that shall be your table." 

Julia, full of excitement, seized the basket, and 
ran to the rock, a little way from the cabin. Pulling 
off half a dozen great oak leaves from a shrub, she 
placed them on the rock. 

" Here is a piece of meat, Harry, on this plate," 
she continued, putting it on an oak leaf; " here is a 
piece of pie ; here is some bread and butter ; here is 
cheese ; and here is a piece of cold apple pudding. 
There ! I forgot the sauce." 

" Never mind the sauce," said Harry ; and ha 
roald hardly keep from bursting into tears, as he 
saw how good the little angel was. 

lc seemed as though she could not have been more 
tn angel, if she had had a pair of wings. The r* 

riiant face was there ; the pure and loving heart wat 
there ; all was there but the wings, and he could 
easily imagine them. 

And what a dinner ! Roast beef, pudding, pie ! 
He was not much accustomed to such luxuries ; but 
just then he did not appreciate the sumptuousness 
of the feast, for it was eclipsed by the higher consid- 
eration of the devotion of the giver. 

" Come, eat, Harry ! I am so glad ! " added Julia. 

" So am I. If you feed me as high as this, I 
shall want to stay here a good while." 

" I hope you will." 

" Only to-day ; to-morrow I must be moving to- 
wards Boston." 

" I was hoping you would stay here a good long 
while. I shall be so pleased to bring you your break- 
fast, and dinner, and supper every day ! " 

" Your father would not like it." 

" I don't know why he shouldn't. You are 
not very hungry ; you don't eat as you did this 
morning." 

"I ate so much then. T^ll me, now, what your 
father said, Julia." 





"He siw George Leman ; ind he told him how 
you tied his horse to the fence, and how careful you 
were to put the blanket on him, so that he shouldn't 
ealrli rnl<i after his hard run. That was very kind 
of you, Harry, when you knew they were after you. 
Father said almost any one would have run the horse 
till he dropped down. That one thing showed that 
fon were not a bad boy." 

" I wouldn't have injured George Leman for any 
thing," added Harry. " He's a good fellow, and 
never did me any harm." 

" He said, when he found his horse, he was so 
glad he wouldn't have chased you any farther for all 
the world. He told father what ilr. Xason said 
about you — that you were a good boy, had good 
feelings, and were willing to work. He didn't blame 
you for not wanting to go to Jacob Wire's — wasn't 
that the man ? " 

" Yes." 

" And he didn't blame you for running away. 
Nobody believes that you set the barn afire ; and, 
Harry, they have caught the other boy — Ben Smart, 
wasn't it ? " 

" Yes, that was his name " 





" They caught him in the woods, over the other 
Bide of the river." 

" I)id you find out whether the dog was killed?" 
nskei Harry. 

" Mr. Leman said he thought he would get ove. 
it ; and he has got his boat again." 

" I am glad of that ; and if any body ever catches 
me with such a fellow as Ben Smart again, they'll 
know it." 

" You can't think how I wanted to tell father 
where you were, when he spoke so well of you. Ho 
even said he hoped you would get off, and that you 
must be in the woods around here somewhere. You 
will let me tell him now — won't you, Harry ? " 
f I think not." 

" Why not, Harry ? " 

" He may hope I will get off, and still not be will- 
ing to help me off." 

Juli i looked very much disappointed ; for she had 
depended upon surprising her father with fhe story 
of the snake, and the little fugitive in the woods. 

" He will be very good to you," pleaded she. 

" I dare say he would ; but he may think it his 





duty to send me back to Redfield; ani Squire Walk* 
er would certainly make me go to Jacob Wire's." 

" But you won't go yet." 

" To-morrow, Julia." 

M I'm afraid you will never get to Boston." 

" O, yes, I shall. I don't think it is safe for me 
to stay here much longer." 

" Why not ? Hardly any one ever goes through 
the woods here at this time of year but myself." 

" Didn't your mother want to know what you 
were going to do with the dinner you brought me ? " 

" No, I went to the store room, and got it. She 
didn't see me ; but I don't like to do any thing un- 
known to her." 

" You mustn't do it again." 

" You must have something to eat." 

'* You have brought enough to last me while I
itop here. To-morrow morning I must start ; so I 
suppose I shall not see you again. But I shall never 
forget you," said Harry, locking as sad as he felt. 

" Xo, you mustn't go off without any breakfast. 
Promise me you will not go till I have brought yon 
some." 





Harry assured Julia he had enough, and ried Ifi 
persuade her not to bring him any more food ; bu« 
Julia was resolute, and he was obliged to promise 
Having finished his dinner, she gathered up the rem- 
nants of the feast, and put them in the cabin for hia 
supper. She was afraid to remain any longer, lest 
she might be missed at home ; and Harry gallantly 
escorted her beyond the brook on her return home. 

He busied himself during the greater part of the 
afternoon in gathering dry grass and dead leaves for 
the improvement of his bed in the cabin. About an 
hour before sundown, he was surprised to receive 
another visit from Julia Bryant. She had her little 
basket in one hand, and in the other she carried a 
little package. 

" I didn't expect to see you again," said Harry, as 
she approached. 

" I don't know as you will like what I have done," 
shfi began, timidly ; " but I did it for the best." 

" I shall like any thing that you have done," an- 
swered Harry, promptly, " even if you should send 
mo back to lledfield." 

" I wouldn't do such a mean thing as that ; but I
have told somebody that you are here." 





" Huve you ? " asked Harry, not a little alarmed. 

" You will forgive me if I have done wrong —  
won t you: 

Harry looked at her. He mistook her anxious 
appearance for sorrow at what she had done. He 
could not give her pain ; so he told her that, what- 
ever she had done, she was forgiven. 

" But vchom have you told." 

" John Lane." 

"Who is he?" 

" Mrs. Lane's oldest son. He drives the baggage 
«iigon that goes to Boston every week. He prom- 
ted not to lisp a word to a single soul, and that he 
^ould be your friend for my sake." 

" Why did you tell him?" 

" Well, you see, I was afraid you would never get 
to Boston; and I thought what a nice thing it would 
be if you could only ride all the way there with John 
Lane. John likes me because I carry things to hia 
mother, and I am sure he won't tell." 

" How good you are, Julia!" exclaimed lL.rry, 
" may forget every body else in the wjrld; bat I 
shall never forgot you." 



£

A tear moistened his eye, as he uttered his enthu- 
iiastic declaration. 

'* The worst of it is, John starts at two o'clock— 
right in the middle of the night." 

" So much the better," replied Harr) r , wiping iviay 
the tear. 

" You will take the wagon on the turnpike, whew 
the cart path comes out. P-ii you won't- wake up." 

" Yes, I shall." 

" I am sorry to have yo^ go ; for I like you, 
Harry. You will be a very good boy, when you gel 
to Boston ; for they say the city is a wicked place." 

" I will try." 

" There are a great many temptations there, peopl* 
say." 

" I shall try to be as good as you are," replied 
Harry, who could imagine nothing better. " If I 
fail once, I shall try again."
