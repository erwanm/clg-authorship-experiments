“You naughty little thing,” he said, good-humoredly. 
“Come, kiss and be friends. And you need not even be 
jealous of Mam’selle Claire. The bees hovered about 
her as if she had been made solid of M. de Bore’s sugar. 
I had only two dances that she promised beforehand.” 

“I am not jealous of — of anybody.” There were 
dainty little signs of her yielding. 

“And this afternoon we will all go out and see the queer 
things in the town. Angelique wants to do some shop- 
ping. And I heard Barbe say you must have some new 
frocks.” 

What feminine creature could resist that? She smiled 
and her pretty face dimpled. 

“Is it true?” she cried to Angelique. “Are we to go 
shopping?” 

“Yes. But we must get over some lessons first.” 

“Sylvie went cheerfully. In one corner of the veranda 
where the rain could be shut out by glass doors 
Angelique had arranged a pretty nest. Gervaise and 
Jaques had made her a very convenient desk out of 
some boxes, and a sewing stand with some shelves. The 
young fellow had picked up a few old books, and bor- 
rowed some of M. Lavalette. He was very much in 
earnest, learning both English and Spanish, and had 
found an old Frenchman, who kept a doctor’s office in 
order and gave lessons to eke out the small salary. In 
turn Gervaise imparted his knowledge to Angelique. 
And since there was no school for Sylvie, and a governess 
seemed beyond their reach at present, she taught her and 
found it a really pleasant occupation. 

There were some shops already in the principal streets, 




but those who knew did not depend altogether on these. 
The Spaniard had placed many restrictions on trade that 
were most vexatious, but there was an undercurrent that 
possibly was winked at, or a privilege paid for, perhaps. 
Goods of all kinds were smuggled in. There were so 
many ways in the innumerable bayous where a small boat 
could find shelter in the mass of over-hanging green, and 
take out bales and bundles adroitly covered by some one in 
waiting. It was not only the delta Creoles that coquetted 
with the pirate vessels at Barataria, which brought in 
rich stores from captured vessels, to be resold in the town 
under the very nose of the authorities. 

Madame Lavalette piloted them. Angelique had really 
seen nothing of the town. Here was the plaza, where 
Almonaster had torn down the barracks after the sweep- 
ing fire and rebuilt the old Cabildo, now a handsome and 
pretentious edifice with arched doorways and broad 
paved space, or court, that led to the real entrance, and 
here old New Orleans’ residents greeted each other and 
discussed business or news or pleasure, and watched the 
passers-by. It was two stories, with large circular-head 
windows and iron balconies, and an ornamental cornice 
rising high above. A little further on, two rows of stores 
built of brick with broad tiled roofs and dormer-windows, 
and gay and bright Spanish awnings. This was the 
fashionable retail quarter of the town, and remained so 
for years. 

From the Place d’Armes the streets gave a bright, busy 
aspect for a short distance, then subsided into dwelling 
houses of stucco, a few of brick and still many of wood. 
Some in the glory of new whitewash glaring in the yel- 
low sun ; others toned down to all softened shades of 
ivory until almost brown. Here was the theatre, where 
ladies and children went of an afternoon. There were 




women out promenading, the negro waiting-maid with 
fan and satchel walking gravely behind, now and then 
lifting Madame’s skirt over some puddle. Pretty, gayly 
attired children with their turbaned nurses, some of them 
ordering in autocratic style, or lading the black hands 
with fruit or budgets. Sylvie looked on entranced. 

“And now they came to a curious rambling row with 
the pitch of the roofs all one way, in some instances 
giving a sharp outline to the street, and a curious second- 
floor balcony at the side with a long, shaky stairs to the 
ground. Then a little one-story shanty, one would almost 
call it, only alongside, perhaps for two hundred feet, a 
high wall with a doorway and wire pickets on the top, 
half hidden by beautiful overhanging trees. Gay laughs 
and the tinkling of a guitar told of a charming house- 
hold in the flowered court so secluded. Then a dark, 
unpretentious one-story place with a window beside the 
door, where various stuffs were lying, faded by the 
morning sunshine. 

They walked through rather a narrow passage with a 
counter on one side where there were piles of common 
goods — gay ginghams, jeans, and Madras headkerchiefs 
(greatly admired by the better-class slaves and free 
women of color), coarse cottonades and muslins. 

“We want to inspect some of your nice goods, M’sieu 
Basnage,” said Madame Lavalette, and she led the way 
through an apartment that presented an appearance not 
unlike a modern junk-shop. This again opened on a sort 
of enclosed court that could be shut at will, but was now 
open to the garden, full of fragrant herbs and flowers. 

“Owf, oui, Madame” answered the dark, wrinkled little 
man, whose black eyes sparkled as he rubbed his hands 
together. “Madame is mos’ welcome. And Madame’s 
frien’s,” glancing rather suspiciously. 

' L. of C. go 


“Yes. They are who were taken by pirates, 

and lost all they had except a little that was left behind. 
Very nice, trustworthy people, M’sieu Basnage.” 

“Ah,” with a long, sympathetic intonation. “Dose 
pirates are terreeble,” and he shook his head lugubri- 
ously. “And dey haf anoder name not so bad — what 
you call — privateers? But it is sad, sad, Madame!” 

“So you must give us good bargains, M’sieu Basnage.” 

“Owf, oui/' with a low obeisance. For Madame Lava- 
lette was one of his very best customers. 

Excellent bargains they certainly were, for Barbe had 
shopped not a little for her pretty young mistress, and 
made not a few purchases for the dead Marquise, and 
was a woman of experience. But Angelique was dazzled 
by the display of elegant goods, and no longer wondered 
at the handsome attire she had seen at Madame 
Henriade’s. M’sieu Basnage was very obliging, and ex- 
tremely moderate in his prices. Then, he would send the 
parcels home that very evening; and so they threaded 
their way through the narrow passage again, and almost 
held their noses at the smell of the commoner goods 
reeking with dye-stuffs. 

“Now I am going to the convent to see Zenobie. Little 
one, wilt thou not come and get thy heart’s desire?” and 
Madame smiled at Sylvie. 

The child’s heart was rent almost in twain. . Curiosity 
to see the strange place swept over her like a great wave 
and almost brought out a smile of assent. But she was 
not going to like Zenobie, and she would not lend her 
small countenance to nuns or convents. So she stiffened 
her back. 

“Thanks, Madame, but not to-day. I will go home 
with tante Barbe.” 

“Oh, but you could all come. There are many visitors. 





Except — the young man/’ laughing with peculiar soft- 
ness. 

Sylvie took his hand. She was quite sure and safe in 
the protection of one who could not be allowed within. 

“Madame will excuse us now/’ returned Barbe, in her 
quiet manner. “And accept our thanks. It has been a 
delightful excursion. We shall be most glad to renew it 
at some other opportunity.” 

Zenobie was doing very well, and would be confirmed 
next week. After her first communion she would come 
home as usual. There was a talk about the dress and 
veil, and then Zenobie was allowed a little walk in the 
garden with ma mere. The child was eager to hear about 
these new people who had stayed at Madame Milhet’s. 
For Laure had played off the beauty and sweetness of 
Angelique and Sylvie, and the charming young man. 

“Claire may like the young lady, Angelique,” she said 
to Laure afterward, “but I am just going to hate that 
little upstart, Sylvie! Nurse said she was cross to 
Felice, and she is a Huguenot — a bad, wicked girl, and I 
shall have nothing to do with her. You may like her as 
much as you please, Laure !” 


CHAPTER VIII. 

A YOUNG man walked up the path — a good-looking, 
jaunty fellow of eighteen or so, quite mature, as Southern- 
ers are wont to be — and yet with all the charm of youth- 
fulness, a happy smiling face, curling black hair, and 



dusky black eyes, with a soft shading on his short upper 
lip. He had a slender bamboo cane in his hand with 
which he switched the heads of some tall grasses. A 
mocking-bird in the hedge began a roulade, and he 
whistled an accompaniment. 

“Mo’sieu Aubreton — is he at home?” 

The voice was soft and rich. Jaques looked up from 
the young trees he was pruning and met the smile. Then 
he glanced up to the balcony. 

“Mam’selle Angelique, is Gervaise up there?” 

“No,” answered the clear girl’s voice. “He and Sylvie 
went for a walk.” 

“Will you be seated, M’sieu? I think he will be back 
presently.” 

“Which way did they go ?” 

“Down toward the creek I believe.” 

“I will saunter on. I may meet him.” 

There was a path through the wilderness that some day 
might be made wide enough for a road. All manner of 
things were in a riotous tangle ; there were many such 
places about. Sometimes the friendly Indians made a 
clearing and erected a wigwam, and all around the trees 
would be charred. Willowbrakes and reedy ponds, 
wild ducks, herons, and birds of almost every description 
settled themselves as soon as their natural enemies re- 
moved. Stray bands of Chickasaws, friendly enough if 
one did not trust them too far, or they were not incited 
by the English to venture upon depredations. Over 
westward, large plantations ; up above, settlements of 
Canadian French, or friendly English, who no longer felt 
bound to their own government — they had been neglected 
by it until their friendship was bought by the mighty 
hand of trade. 

Gervaise was very fond of rambling about. The great 





river on one side, the mighty lake on the other; the 
bustling activity, the busy crowds, were only a stone’s- 
throw, it seemed, from the quiet of this wilderness. 

Sylvie started up hosts of birds from the marshy wilds 
by throwing a stone or stick, and laughed to hear the 
screams and calls. 

“They are scolding back,” she cried, gleefully. “Oh, 
Gervaise, look at the beautiful white ones, with their long 
necks. And oh, the babies !” 

The two swans, with their progeny, were floating 
majestically on a space that widened out to a miniature 
lake. Great lilies were abloom at its edges — white, 
yellow, and a pinkish tint. They both stood silent. 

A curious, low, flute-like whistle startled Gervaise. 
He had already heard so many weird and horrible stories 
of runaway slaves, and treacherous Indians hiding in the 
morasses. But no — it might be some strange bird. 

“Is it some one calling to the swans?” inquired the 
child. For the head of the flock suddenly wheeled about, 
stretched out his long neck, and emitted a peculiar hissing 
sound through his pink bill. 

“A snake, more likely. Sylvie, I ought not have 
brought you here ” 

“And not to see the swans ! Oh, if I had some bread 
to feed them with !” 

“You couldn’t get near them. Come.” 

Sylvie gave a defiant curl to her lips and clasped her 
hands behind her. A figure appeared around the clump 
of willows. 

“Aha !” cried a merry voice. 

Gervaise smiled and advanced a few steps. 

“De Longpre,” he exclaimed. “Is it happy accident 
or design ? But you never could have followed our wind- 
ing way.” 





“Something of both. I went to your house. You see 
I can find my way easily. And as I came nearer I 
thought I heard voices. If you had been alone I should 
have gone straight up to Lavalette. 

He laughed a little as he said this, and Gervaise, in 
spite of himself, colored. 

“Your sister?” 

Sylvie had looked shyly out from under her broad hat. 

“No. There are three of us related, and not very 
nearly. I don’t know that I could trace it myself. 
Second or third cousins.” 

“Then is she not even Mademoiselle’s sister?” 

“No; not even that,” was the answer. 

“I belong to Gervaise,” said the child, proudly, as she 
came and slipped her hand in his. 

“A pretty piece of property, truly. Six or eight years 
may tell a different story. I had an errand for fair, 
and it is wonderful that I should find you so easily. I 
am sent from Madame Henriade. She wishes to see you. 
It is to join a pleasure party.” 

“A pleasure party?” in joyous surprise. 

“Yes. You have not been down Point Grasse, Lake 
Pontchartrain. Madame has an old relative, General 
Vilaneuve. Report has it that he adores Madame ; but 
he is quite old enough — no, perhaps not quite for a 
grandfather,” laughing gayly. “Every year he has a 
birthday. It makes one old too fast,” with an airy toss 
of the head. “When I am say — forty, I shall have a 
birthday only once in five years.” 

“Does a birthday make you older every time?” queried 
the child, who had been listening intently, and struck by a 
new thought. 

“I believe they have that bad habit.” 




“Then if you could have two in one year ” it was 

a new way of growing up, and pleased her. 

“It might do very well for little ones like you.” 

“That is what I want it for; just for myself.” 

“And why do you want all these added years ?” 

Sylvie hung her head and glanced shyly at Gervaise, 
who gave a half frown. 

“But about this party?” began the young fellow. 

“Ah, Madame Henriade has to manage — what do you 
call it — chaperon it. And the General is fond of young 
people.” 

“I am such a stranger ” 

“She is giving you a chance. My fine fellow, I was 
jealous this morning when I heard her so enthusiastic. 
And I told her so. ‘Mon fils' she said, ‘have I not been 
considerate of you, finding pretty girls for your partners. 
And now you can choose for yourself.' Which is true. 
She is charming.” 

Henri de Longpre did not add another of her com- 
mendations : “He is a young refugee ; well-bred, well- 
mannered. We need every one to crowd out these push- 
ing Americans. We must bring him into our circle. He 
has the flavor of Paris.” 

Gervaise laughed with some embarrassment. 

“It was delightful — the evening at her house. She 
was most kind.” 

“And I am to bring you back with me.” 

“What ! — to the Rue Royale?” 

“Yes, at once.” 

“Then I must return. You are quite mysterious. 
Come, Sylvie.” 

“No, there is no mystery. Only she does not wish the 
invitation to be quite second-hand. I merely come with 




the message. I proffered my services. Otherwise you 
would have had a little note sent by a messenger.” 

'‘Come, Sylvie,” he said again, without looking back, 
and took a few steps with De Longpre. 

Sylvie was affronted. She made a sudden plunge in 
the thicket. 

“Where is the child? Sylvie !” 

She was shaking with mischievous laughter. From a 
little opening she saw him turn toward the pool, and look 
up and down, in perplexity. 

“Why, it is odd! One might easily get lost in this 
wild.” De Longpre glanced around. 

Gervaise was vexed. “Sylvie,” he cried, authorita- 
tively. “Come hither at once.” 

There was no answer. Then he began to stir among 
the bushes. De Longpre followed his example. 

“I have her. Here she is!” he cried. “Oh, you little 
Mischief! You are a wood nymph wild.” 

The Mischief evaded his hand and ran. There was 
but one clear space, down to the little lake. Up around 
the side of it — she would lead them a chase, for she was 
fleet as a deer. 

Alas! the path was clear, to be sure. But just as she 
turned, her foot caught in a root that had been washed bare 
by frequent inundations, and the impetus sent her face- 
downward in the pool, just as an instant more he must 
have caught her frock. 

The splash startled the swans and there was a great 
outcry. The water that had been tolerably clear was a 
muddy ooze. 

“Just here, Aubreton. Oh, she does not rise. She is 
fast in something. Here, I will wade out ” 

“No, no !” Gervaise stepped into the water. 

“Take this stick. It may be deeper than you think, 
and these places are treacherous.” 

Aubreton felt his way carefully, and then touched 
something that was still making a swirl in the water. 
He stooped and brought up Sylvie, but she did not even 
struggle. 

“Oh, my God, she cannot be dead all in a moment,” 
he cried, holding up a drooping figure. 

“Wash off her face. She went down in the soft mud. 
And she may have struck something.” 

With the skirt of her frock Gervaise washed the mud 
from eyes and mouth and clinging hair ; but she lay there 
limp and still. He chafed the little hands. What did 
one do to a drowned person ? 

“Let us take her home as soon as possible.” 

Gervaise looked at his friend’s white suit and the 
muddy burden before them. 

“No,” he said. “Go as quick as you can and bring 
M’sieu Jaques, and — a hammock. Meanwhile, I may 
bring her to.” 

De Longpre was off like a flash. Gervaise took off 
the pretty apron that had been white but a moment ago, 
and washed it tolerably clean; then bathed her, chafed 
her, rolled her over on a grassy spot. There was no 
bruise on her forehead. Her nose was full of the soft 
ooze; her mouth he had already washed out. Oh, what 
if she were dead — the dear, pretty little thing! and he 
kissed her tenderly — put his hot, flushed cheek to hers. 
Was that a sigh? Then there was a sudden red flash — 
gone in a moment — but it gave him hope. Her heart 
was beating. There was a little flutter in her neck and 
the eyelids — another sigh.
