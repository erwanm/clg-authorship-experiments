continued the noble lines--

                     "Ah, why
  Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect
  God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore,
  Only among the crowd, and under roofs
  That our frail hands have raised?"

Charley smiled dubiously, but held his peace. The crowd thickened
with their advance. Horses were tethered in solid ranks to the trees;
children straying frightfully near to their heels; wagons and carriages
almost piled upon each other; and men, white and black, stood about
everywhere. The driver reined up, twenty yards from the arbor erected
under the trees.

"Drive up nearer, Tom!" said Carry.

"He cannot," replied Arthur, letting down the steps. "Look!"

There was a quadruple row of vehicles on three sides of the arbor, the
fourth being, at considerable pains, left open for passage. Several
young men dashed to the side of the carriage, with as much empressment
as at a ball, and thus numerously attended, the girls picked their way
through the throng and dust. No gentlemen were, as yet, in their seats,
and our party secured a vacant bench midway to the pulpit.

"Don't sit next to the aisle," whispered Arthur.

"Why not?" questioned Ida, removing to the other extremity of the plank.

"Oh! it is more comfortable here. We will be with you again presently."

"That is not all the reason," remarked Carry, when he was gone.
"This railing protects us from the press on this side; and our young
gentleman will not permit any one to occupy the stand without, but
themselves."

"Will they not sit down?"

"No, indeed! there will not be room. Then the aisles will be filled
with all sorts of people, and our dresses be liable to damage from
boots and tobacco juice."

"Tobacco juice!" was she in a barbarous country! As Carry predicted,
their three attendants worked their way, between the wheels and the
people, to where they sat. Charley crawled under the rail, and planted
himself behind them.

"I can keep my position until some pretty girl dislodges me," said he.
"The denizens of these parts have not forgotten how to stare."

He might well say so. A battery of eyes was levelled upon them,
wherever they looked. The tasteful dress and elegant appearance of the
ladies, and their attractive suite, were subjects of special importance
to the community at large. Although eclipsed in show by some present,
theirs was a new constellation, and they must support observation as
they could. They stood fire bravely; Ida was most unaccustomed to it,
and she found so much to interest and divert her, that she became
unconscious of the annoyance after a little.

"Are those seats reserved for distinguished strangers? have not we a
right to them?" designating a tier in front of the speaker's stand.

"They are the anxious benches," returned Charley.

"Nonsense!"

"So I think. The brethren dissent from us. I am not quizzing. That is
the name."

"The mourners--the convicted occupy them," said Carry.

"Are they here?" inquired Ida, credulously. It was preposterous to
conceive such a possibility in this frivolous loud-talking assembly.

"Not now;" answered Charley. "But when they crowd on the steam, you
will witness scores."

"Fie! Charley? it is wicked to speak so!"

"I am just as pious as if I did not, Carry. I'll wager my horse--and
head too--that by to-night, Miss Ida will agree with me, that these
religious frolics are more hurtful to the cause they are intended to
advance, than fifty such harmless affairs, as we attended on Thursday
night."

"I am not solemnised yet;" said Ida.

"You are as solemn as you are going to be. You may be excited, or
frightened into something like gravity. Two, three, four preachers!
That's what I call a waste of the raw material. What a flutter of
ribbons and fans! The congregation reminds me of a clover field,
with the butterflies hovering over its gaily-colored, bobbing heads.
Handsome ladies by dozens! This county is famed for its beauty, and but
one tolerable-looking man in its length and breadth!"

"Why, there is Mr. Euston--what fault have you to find in him?"

"He is the honorable exception. Whom did you think I meant?" smiling
mischievously at Carry's unguarded query. "Art. here, is passable.
Modesty prevents my saying more, as we are daily mistaken for each
other. The music strikes up;--rather quavering; they are not in the
'spirit' yet. They never get to the 'understanding.' I must decamp.
Those fair ones are too bashful to look this way, while I am here."

He was on the outside of the rail, sedate and deacon-like, in a
minute. Unsuited as his remarks were to the time and place, they were
less objectionable than the whispers of the ladies who dispossessed
him;--critiques upon Susan's beaux and Joseph's sweethearts; upon
faces, dress and deportment; a quantity of reprobation, and very sparse
praises.

The preacher was an unremarkable man, who delivered, in a sing-song
tone, an unremarkable discourse; opposing no impediment to the
sociability of the aforementioned damsels, except that they lowered
their shrill staccato to a piano. The gentlemen whispered behind
their hats, notched switches, and whittled sticks. The hearers from
Poplar-grove, albeit they were gay, youthful, and non-professors,
were the most decorous auditors in their part of the congregation.
Another minister arose; a man not yet in his thirtieth year, his form
stooped, as beneath the weight of sixty winters. The crowd stilled
instantly. He leaned, as for support, upon the primitive desk; his
attenuated hands clasped, his eyes moving slowly in their cavernous
recesses, over the vast assemblage. "And what come ye out into the
wilderness for to see?" he said, in a voice of preternatural sweetness
and strength. "Aye! ye are come as to a holiday pageant, bedecked in
tinsel and costly raiment. I see before me the pride of beauty and
youth; the middle-aged, in the strength of manliness and honor, the
hoary hairs and decrepid limbs of age;--all trampling--hustling each
other in your haste--in one beaten road--the way to death and judgment!
Oh! fools and blind! slow-worms, battening upon the damps and filth
of this vile earth! hugging your muck rakes while the glorious One
proffers you the crown of Life!" The bent figure straightened; the
thin hands were endowed with a language of power, as they pointed, and
shook, and glanced through the air. His clarion tones thrilled upon
every ear, their alarms and threatenings and denunciations; in crashing
peals, the awful names of the Most High, and His condemnations of the
wicked, descended among the throng; and those fearful eyes were fiery
and wrathful. At the climax he stopped;--with arms still upraised, and
the words of woe and doom yet upon his lips, he sank upon the arm of a
brother beside him, and was led to his seat, ghastly as a corpse, and
nearly as helpless.

A female voice began a hymn.

  "This is the field, the world below,--
  Where wheat and tares together grow;
  Jesus, ere long will weed the crop,
  And pluck the tares in anger up."

The hills, for miles around, reverberated the bursting chorus,

  "For soon the reaping time will come,
  And angels shout the harvest home!"

The ministers came down from the stand, and distributed themselves
among the people; bowed heads and shaking forms marking their path;--a
woman from the most remote quarter of the throng, rushed up to the
mourner's seats, and flung herself upon her knees with a piercing
cry;--another and another;--some weeping aloud; some in tearless
distress;--numbers knelt where they had sat;--and louder and louder,
like the final trump, and the shout of the resurrection morn, arose the
surge of song;--

    "For soon the reaping time will come
    And angels shout the harvest home!"

Carry trembled and shrank; and Ida's firmer nerves were quivering. A
lull in the storm, and a man knelt in the aisle, to implore "mercy and
pardon for a dying sinner, who would not try to avert the wrath to
come."

Sonorous accents went on with his weeping petition;--praying for "the
hardened, thoughtless transgressors--those who had neither part nor
lot in this matter; who stood afar off, despising and reckless." Again
rolled out a chorus; speaking now of joyful assurance.

  "Jesus my all to heaven has gone--
    (When we get to heaven we will part no more,)
  He whom I fix my hopes upon--
    When we get to heaven we will part no more.
  Oh! Fare-you-well! oh! fare-you-well!
    When we get to heaven we will part no more,
                              Oh! Fare-you-well!"

Ida's eyes brimmed, and Carry sobbed with over-wrought feeling. Arthur
bent over the railing and spoke to the latter. He looked troubled,--but
for her: Lynn stood against one of the pillars which supported the
roof; arms crossed, and a redder mantling of his dark cheek; Charley
was cool and grave, taking in the scene in all its parts, with no
sympathy with any of the phases of emotion. The tumult increased;
shouted thankgivings, and wails of despair; singing and praying and
exhorting, clashing in wild confusion.

"You had best not stay here," said Arthur to Carry, whose struggles for
composure he could not bear to see.

"Suffer me to pass, Dr. Dana;" and a venerable minister stooped
towards the weeping girl. "My daughter, why do you remain here, so
far from those who can do you good? You are distressed on account of
sin; are you ashamed to have it known? Do you not desire the prayer of
Christians? I will not affirm that you cannot be saved anywhere; 'the
arm of the Lord is not shortened,' but I do warn you, that if you hang
back in pride or stubbornness, you will be lost; and these only can
detain you after what you have heard. Arise, and join that company of
weeping mourners, it may not be too late."

Carry shook her head.

"Then kneel where you are, and I will pray for you."

She dried her tears. "Why should I kneel, Mr. Manly? I do not
experience any sorrow for sin."

"My child!"

"My tears are not those of penitence; I do not weep for my sinfulness;
I can neither think nor feel in this confusion."

The good man was fairly stumbled by this avowal.

"Have you no interest in this subject?"

"Not more than usual, sir. My agitation proceeded from animal
excitement."

"I am fearful it is the same in a majority of instances, Mr. Manly;"
said Arthur, respectfully.

"You my perceive your error one day, my son; let me entreat you to
consider this matter as binding up your eternal welfare; and caution
you not to lay a feather in the way of those who may be seeking their
salvation."

Arthur bowed silently; and the minister passed on.

Dr. Carleton retired early that evening with a headache. Mrs. Dana
was getting the children to sleep; the young people had the parlor to
themselves. Charley was at the piano, fingering over sacred airs; psalm
tunes, sung by the Covenanters, in their craggy temples, or murmuring
to an impromptu accompaniment, a chant or doxology. All at once he
struck the chords boldly, and added the full powers of the instrument
to his voice, in the fine old melody of Brattle Street. Lynn ceased his
walk through the room, and united his rich bass at the second line;
Arthur, a tenor; Carry and Ida were happy to be permitted to listen--

  "While Thee I seek, protecting Power,
    Be my vain wishes stilled;
  And may this consecrated hour
    With better hopes be filled.

  Thy love the power of thought bestowed,
    To thee my thoughts would soar;
  Thy mercy o'er my life has poured,
    That mercy I adore.

  In each event of life how clear
    Thy ruling hand I see!
  Each mercy to my soul most dear.
    Because conferred by Thee.

  In every joy that crowns my days,
    In every pain I bear,
  My heart shall find delight in praise,
    Or seek relief in prayer.

  When gladness wings my favored hour,
    Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
  Resigned--when storms of sorrow lower,
    My soul shall meet Thy will.

  My lifted eye, without a tear,
    The gathering storm shall see;
  My steadfast heart shall know no fear,
    That heart will rest on Thee!"

"There!" said Charley, "there is more religion in that hymn than in all
the fustian we have heard to-day; sermons, prayers and exhortations.
Humbug in worldly concerns is despicable; in the church, it is
unbearable."

"Consider, Charley, that hundred of pious people believe in the
practices you condemn. Some of the best Christians I know were
converted at these noisy revivals," said Carry.

"It would be miraculous if there were not a grain or two of wheat in
this pile of chaff. I never attend one that I am not the worse for
it. It is a regular annealing furnace; when the heat subsides you can
neither soften or bend the heart again--the iron is steel. What does
Miss Ida say?"

"That sin is no more hateful, or religion more alluring, for this
Sabbath's lessons; still, I acquiesce in Carry's belief, that although
mistaken in their zeal, these seeming fanatics are sincere."

"You applaud enthusiasm upon other subjects, why not in religion?"
asked Lynn, "if any thing, it is everything. If I could believe that,
when the stormy sea of life is passed, heaven--an eternal noon-tide
of love and blessedness would be mine--a lifetime would be too short,
mortal language too feeble to express my transport. There is a void
in the soul which nought but this can satisfy. Life is fresh to us
now; but from the time of Solomon to the present, the worlding has
nauseated at the polluted spring, saying, 'For all his days are sorrow,
and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night.' I
envy--not carp at the joys of those whose faith, piercing through the
fogs of this lower earth, reads the sure promise--'It is your Father's
good pleasure to give you the kingdom.'"

"You do homage to the beauty of the Faith, by whomsoever professed.
I note its practical effects; judge of its genuineness by its
workings. For example, the Old Harry awoke mightily within me, in
intermission, to see Dick Rogers preaching to Carry, threatening her
with perdition--she, who never in her life, committed a tenth of the
sin he is guilty of every day. He has been drunk three times in the
last month; he is a walking demijohn; his hypocrisy a shame to his
grey hairs. And James Mather--he would sell his soul for a fourpence,
and call it clear gain. Sooner than lose a crop, he forces his negroes
to work on Sunday--can't trust the God of harvest, even upon His own
day. The poor hands are driven on week-days as no decent man would do
a mule;--he let his widowed sister go to the poor-house, and offered
to lend John five thousand dollars, the next week at eight per cent. I
have known him since I was a shaver, and never had a word from him upon
the 'one thing needful,' except at church. And he was in the altar,
this morning, shouting as though the Lord were deaf!"

"Charley! Charley!"

"Facts are obstinate things, Carry. Next to being hypocritical
ourselves, is winking at it in others. The church keeps these men in
her bosom; she must not complain, if she shares in the odium they
merit. They are emphatically sounding brass."

"Let them grow together until the harvest," said Arthur. "It is a
convincing proof of the truth of Religion, that there are careful
counterfeits."

"I do not impeach the 'truth of Religion.' You need not speak so
reproachfully, Arthur. I believe in the Christianity of the Scriptures.
What I assail, is intermittent piety; springs, whose channels are
dusty, save at particular seasons;--camp-meetings and the like; men,
who furbish up their religion, along with their go-to-meeting boots,
and wear it no longer. Their brethren despise them as I do; but their
mouths are shut, lest they 'bring disgrace upon their profession.'
It can have no fouler disgrace than their lives afford. I speak what
others conceal; when one of these whited sepulchres lifts his Bible
to break my head, for a graceless reprobate, I pelt him with pebbles
from the clear brook. Look at old Thistleton! a mongrel,--porcupine
and bull-dog;--pricking and snarling from morning 'till night. A
Christian is a gentleman; he is a surly growler. Half of the
church hate, the other half dread him; yet he sits on Sabbaths, in
the high places of the synagogues, leads prayer-meetings, and weeps
over sinners--sanctified 'brother Thistleton.' He thunders the law
at me; and I knock him down with a stout stick, St. John cuts ready
to my hand;--'If a man say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is
a liar!' I hush up Rogers, with--'No drunkard shall inherit the
kingdom;' and Mather, with, 'You cannot serve God and Mammon.' They say
I am a scoffer;--I don't care. Now"--continued this contrary being,
passing into a tone of reverent feeling;--"There is my kind guardian.
I don't believe he ever shouted, or made a public address in his life.
He lives his religion; a child can perceive that the Bible is a 'lamp
to his feet;' a pillar of cloud in prosperity; a sun in adversity. I
saw it when a boy, and it did me more good than the preached sermons I
have listened to since. He called me into his study the night before I
left home, and gave me a copy of 'the book.' 'Charley, my son,' said
he, 'you are venturing upon untried seas; here is the Chart, to which
I have trusted for twenty years; and have never been led by it, upon
a quicksand. Look to it, my boy!' I have read it, more, because he
asked it, than for its intrinsic value; that is my failing, not his.
I have waded through sloughs of theories and objections; but hold to
it still. Especially, when I am here, and kneel in my old place at the
family altar; hear the solemn tones, that quieted my boyish gayety;
when I witness his irreproachable, useful life, I say, 'His chart is
true; would I were guided by it!' No--no--Art.! I may be careless and
sinful;--I am no skeptic."

"A skeptic" exclaimed Lynn. "There never was one! Voltaire was a fiend
incarnate; a devil, who 'believed and trembled,' in spite of his
hardihood; Paine, a brute, who, inconvenienced by a soul, which would
not sink as low as his passions commanded, tried to show that he had
none, as the easiest method of disembarrassing himself. That one of
God's creatures, who can look up to the glories of a night like this,
or see the sun rise to-morrow morning, and peep, in his insect voice,
a denial of Him who made the world, is demon or beast;--often both.
'Call no man happy 'till he dies.' Atheists have gone to the stake for
their opinions; but physical courage or the heat of fanaticism, not the
belief, sustained them. We have yet to hear of the infidel, who died in
his bed,

  'As one who wraps the drapery of his couch
  About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.'"

"It is a mystery that one can die tranquilly," said Carry.

"I have stood by many peaceful death-beds," returned Arthur. "I never
wish so ardently for an interest in the Redemption, as when I watch
the departure of a saint. One verse is in my mind for days afterwards.
I repeat it aloud as I ride alone; and it lingers in my last waking
thought at night:

  'Jesus can make a dying bed
    Feel soft as downy pillows are;
  While on his breast, I lean my head,
    And breathe my life out sweetly there.'

"And why do you not encourage these feelings?" asked Charley, bluntly.
"I call that conviction; a different thing from the burly of this
morning. You want to be a Christian;--so do I sometimes; but you are a
more hopeful subject."

"I am by no means certain of that. You would never abide with the
half-decided, so long as I have done. You are one of the 'violent,' who
would take the kingdom of Heaven by force."

"How strange!" said Charley, thoughtfully.

"What is strange?" inquired his brother.

"Here are five of us, as well-assured of the verity of Christianity,
and God's revealed Word, as of our own existence; the ladies,
practising every Christian virtue; Lynn, prepared to break a lance
with infidelity in any shape; you, like Agrippa, almost persuaded;
and I, stripping off the borrowed plumage of those who have a name to
live;--yet we will be content to close our eyes in sleep, uncertain of
re-opening them in life;--unfit for Death and Eternity!"

He turned again to the piano; Arthur quitted the room; Lynn gazed out
of the window, with working features; Carry shaded her eyes with her
hand; Ida felt a cold awe creeping over her. 'Death and Eternity!' had
she heard the words before? how out of place in the bright warm life
they were leading! Here were true friendships, tried and strengthened
by years; young love, joying in his flowery course; refined and
congenial spirits; the luxuries of wealth and taste;--how unwelcome the
hand that lifted the drapery which enveloped the skeleton! 'Death and
Eternity!' The spell was upon the scented air; the moon threw shadows
upon the grass, as of newly heaped graves; and the vibrating cords
spoke but of the one awful theme!




CHAPTER X.


"Our last ride--can it be!" said Lynn, when the horses were brought
to the gate, early in a September afternoon. Ida smiled faintly. The
parting of the morrow, was, to her, the death of a summer's day, to
be succeeded by wintry darkness. Not even Carry knew how the prospect
oppressed her.

Lynn saw that his remark was injudicious, and endeavoured to atone
for it, by the most delicate assiduity of attention. Their liking had
matured into an attachment, which might have been predicated upon their
consonance of feeling and sentiment. Her calmer judgment gave her the
ascendancy, which belonged of right, to the masculine mind; he did not
look up--she could not have respected him if he had; but he consulted
and appealed to her, as a brother would ask counsel of an elder sister.
She learned to imitate Charley, in curbing his impetuosity; and he
chafed less at her soft touch upon the rein. No bantering checked the
growth of their friendship; they were, for the time, members of one
family; Lynn and Charley were no more to the disengaged young lady than
Arthur.

Their excursion was to a splendid mansion, fifteen miles from
Poplar-grove, lately completed, and not yet occupied by a wealthy
landed proprietor, the Croesus of the county. Arthur had seen it, and
carried home such a report of its stately grandeur, that a visit was
forthwith projected. Nature was in one of her richest autumnal moods.

"She dies, as a queen should--in royal robes,"--said Lynn. "Note the
purple haze upon those hills, and the yellow glory that bathes the
foreground! I would sacrifice this right arm, could I first transfer
that light to canvass. Loveliness like this maddens me with a Tantalus
frenzy. To think that it must fade, when it should be immortal! I would
have it ever before me."

"It lives in your memory. That is a pleasure, time nor distance
diminishes."

"I am not satisfied with this selfish hoarding. A voice is ever urging
me on,--'Create! create!' it cries; and while my pencil moves, I am a
creator; exulting in the pictures graven upon my soul, as no parent
ever joyed over a beloved child. 'They are mine--mine!' I repeat in
an ecstacy. I have wept above--almost worshipped them! Then comes the
chill, grey light of critical reason, as when you awake at morning, and
see things as they are: the soul-pictures are beauteous still:--my
copy the veriest daub!"

"The keenness of your disappointment is an augury of success. The
lithography is perfect--you must not despond at the failure of one
proof-impression. Your mortification is a greater triumph than the
complacency with which a mediocre genius surveys his work."

"You remember Sheridan's maiden speech," said Charley.

"I have read of Demosthenes'," replied Lynn.

"Sheridan's was a similar case. He was hooted at for his presumption;
his first and second attempts were wretched: and his friends advised
him to retire from the rostrum forever. 'Never!' said he, striking his
breast. 'It is here, and shall come out!'"
