it near any point where we drove that day? ” 

“ Oh, no. Confess you were a little home- 
sick just then.” 

There was a sound of merriment in his tone. 

“ I will admit it was quite a pronounced 
case. Not for the home merely, but a sort of 
homelikeness, if you can understand. And 
now come and inspect the beginnings of our 
fernery.” 

It was quite a large oblong box, standing 
where it took the light of the window, but not 
the sun. 

“ I wanted all small plants so the children 
could see them grow. Of course we could buy 
some, but I thought it more interesting to hunt 
them up on their native soil.” 

“ And get some that have shed their summer 


 

garments. In the warmth of the room they 
will soon sprout again. I like to see them 
unroll their gray, downy heads. I think I will 
have to send a few flowers that will bloom, to 
set in the windows. Would you like it? ” 

“ Oh, very much.” 

“And Saturday — will that suit?” 

“ Yes. Thank you ever so much for the 
pleasure.” 

“ Now I must go and visit Mr. Underwood. 
Have them all meet at Mrs. Stirling’s. At 
two, the days are beginning to shorten.” 

Then he bowed himself out. Helen picked 
up some papers, put her desk in order, rolled 
up the exercises she was going to take home to 
read over. Miss Jaynes was standing on the 
steps of the main building, talking to one of 
the grammar teachers. Helen beckoned to 
her. 

“ I’ve had such a delightful plan proposed 
to me, and I accepted it just at the moment 
without considering the pros or cons. And 
now I am in trouble. Some one must help me 
out.” 

“ I shall be very glad to if I can,” and the 




listener's eyes brightened. She was older than 
Miss Grant and had taught several years, but 
the college dignity of Helen kept her a trifle 
in awe. 

Helen detailed the plan with eager interest, 
putting it on the ground of a search for 
ferns. 

“Why, that is — just splendid! One wants 
to be girlish now and then over a very good 
thing. What is the difficulty ?” 

“Oh, will you go? The surrey seats are 
quite broad, three can sit on them, part being 
rather slim girls. I thought of the smaller 
children. Most of the larger girls come from 
the well-to-do-classes whose parents have car- 
riages and autos, or ride wheels. It would be 
a treat to the younger ones, and, do you know, 
I think they evince more interest in the 
fernery.” 

“ Oh, they certainly do. The airs of some 
of the larger ones make me smile. I wish they 
could be in a freshman class at college for the 
first year and get quizzed,” laughing. “ But 
how to make a choice? You really can judge 

r 

better than I.” 





Helen studied her confrere intently, ap- 
provingly. 

“ It ought to be as a sort of reward,” con- 
tinued Miss Jaynes. 

“ Yes, I think so.” 

“ Miss Grant, it is a good thing they can’t 
try for it. Not that I disapprove of such 
measures. There are two girls who nearly 
always have perfect records. Lois Vail is one, 
Edna March another. You do not know the 
Vails?” 

“ No. I was somehow attracted by the 
name. It is rather uncommon. There is an- 
other child in the grammar school. Mr. Un- 
derwood thinks she will be promoted in Feb- 
ruary. They are fine students.” 

“ I wish you would go with me sometime 
and call on them. Their mother is worth 
knowing.” 

“ You interest me. I haven’t meant to be 
exclusive, but there have been so many 
things ” 

“Yes. You see I knew these two in the 
grammar school. There are three more, but 
one is a baby.” 




“ Are they well-to-do ? That is a Westfield 
provincialism.” 

Miss Jaynes laughed. “ A kind of country 
gauging,” she returned. “ No. The father 
is some sort of overseer in the cloth mill. 
They have a pretty cottage with a large garden. 
How Mrs. Vail finds time to do so much and 
take care of the babies passes me. She keeps 
them all tidy and she is sensible enough to 
dress them plainly.” 

“ I suppose she is a superior woman? ” 

“ In one sense of the word. I once heard her 
say she had very little chance for education, 
but she meant that her children should have. 
She is by no means ignorant and talks well, 
correctly. They have an interesting plan. 
She puts her baby to sleep early. Then at the 
table the children talk of what they have 
learned during the day. There is no hurrying 
to get the dishes washed. Afterward the 
children study their lessons for the next day 
and talk them over at breakfast. Lois al- 
ways has perfect recitations and is a well- 
mannered girl, more truly polite than many of 
the richer ones.” 


 

“ Why, they must be worth seeing. I 
should call her a superior woman. And now 
— we can take six children, I think, if we agree 
to crowd a little.” 

“ You are very good to include me.” 

“ Most of the children will be from your 
department. Perhaps that will be better — it 
will stir up no jealousy.” 

“ Edna March and Sadie Corwin. I am 
afraid I shall have to look over my register for 
the others. You are sure six will not crowd 
too much ? ” 

“ We can put two on the seat with 
the driver. Oh, a little squeeze will not 
hurt. In fact it looks very much like a 
picnic to me. Do you know about North 
Bend ? ” 

“ Oh, yes. It is very pretty. The wind in 
the river makes a pond where there is safe 
skating in the winter. It’s a funny river, up 
above here. There is a channel a mile or so 
farther up, then it gets lost in obscurity. At 
Pleasantdale, some five or six miles above here, 
it widens out again and is fed by several 
creeks. It is really beautiful in the spring and 




in the autumn after the rains. You have not 
been about much ? ” tentatively. 

“ Mr. Winslow took me for an automobile 
ride. Mrs. Winslow thinks it the perfection 
of traveling. Perhaps I should on a five- 
thousand-mile journey. I was tied up in a 
veil, which I can’t endure, but I saw the bene- 
fit of it. We went like the wind and you had 
to gasp for breath. All about was a blur. I 
might like a more moderate pace. Next 
spring I think I shall hire a comfortable nag 
who will not disdain wayside grass, and go 
really sight-seeing.” 

“ Let me share the expense now and then,” 
she besought. 

Helen nodded. “ When shall we give the 
invitations?” she asked. 

“ Not until Friday noon. Otherwise we 
may be besieged.” 

“ But that seems such a short notice. Some 
of their mothers may not consent.” 

“ Oh, they will. If not, we can pick up a 
stray somewhere,” Miss Jaynes said gayly. 
“ You see it would have a tendency to distract 
Friday’s attention.” 


I 

That was true enough. 

They were each going different ways. 
Helen sauntered slowly along when Mr. Un- 
derwood overtook her. 

“ So you have been offered a sort of ex- 
cursion,” he commented, laughing with a tint 
of mischief in his eyes. 

“ Miss Jaynes and I are to take some of the 
children up to North Bend for ferns. Mr. 
Hildreth is to send his big surrey,” she replied 
in a most ordinary tone. “ Some of the best 
scholars are to be thus rewarded.” 

“ He has a new crochet in his head. Not 
exactly that,” in a more serious tone. “ I do 
believe it would be a rather good thing. We 
had a parents’ association last winter, but it 
didn’t amount to much. They can go through 
the worst storm to a card party, but anything 
of real value — I do wish parents took more 
interest in these early years of their children. 
You can teach, but you can’t murder the 
queen’s English and learn for them, though 
some people think you might. Eastman be- 
gins to improve. His father came to see me 
and wondered if we had the right person in the 




right place, as the head of the school. Look 
me in the face and you will see what I said.” 

They both laughed. 

“ You are a very good friend,” she sub- 
joined, with deep feeling. 

“ That fellow ought to be sent away to a 
regular boys’ school. However, if he makes 
trouble he will find a short shrift. Dinsmore 
is doing better.” 

“ Why do not the boys have a ball club for 
the sake of the esprit de corps f ” 

“ I thought they were to.” 

“ I believe the younger ones would have 
done so, but the notable players were in an 
outside club.” 

“ I don’t quite like that, but I did not want 
to seem arbitrary on the start, since we were a 
rather puny folk.” 

“ I think of appointing a debate. If I could 
get the girls up to the point.” 

“ The days of chromos have gone by,” he 
returned with a funny inflection. “ We might 
offer a prize of a gold watch for the best argu- 
ment well rendered. Or a football suit well 
padded. My people are doing wondrous well. 


 

They want to enter the high school in 
February.” 

“ I shall be glad to have them, on the prin- 
ciple that a large family of children entertain 
each other and are less trouble. A crowd is 
stimulating.” 

“ Thank you for looking at it so cheerfully.” 
“ I’ve been used to large numbers. They 
can get up a wider interest. They rub off the 
sharp corners. They find one person doesn’t 
know it all, and that in many things there is 
more than one way. I change my mind about 
matters, methods. What is life for but to 
broaden you out ? ” 

“ If you didn't have to get narrowed in 
again.” 

“ Well, sometimes you do take up too much 
room and you find that out, too.” 

“ Alas, mortifying fact ! ” 

“ Shrunken goods give more satisfaction.” 
“ Did Mr. Hildreth put you down for one of 
the talkers ? ” he inquired. 

“ Oh, I sincerely hope not ! ” 

It was Mr. Underwood’s turn to laugh 
then. 



u We will have to talk it over. Come down 
some evening. Mrs. Underwood thinks you 
neglect her because her schooldays are 
passed; ” 

Helen turned up her street with a gay nod. 


CHAPTER VII 


, OCTOBER AND HALLOWE’EN 

The children had all gathered in the sitting- 
room at Mrs. Stirling’s before the surrey 
came. Not one sent an excuse. And children 
they really were, from twelve to almost four- 
teen. Daisy Bingham was the oldest and the 
smallest, but she had a bright little brown face 
and soft brown eyes, while her hair was light, 
a curious combination. She sighed for the 
purple-black hair one of her favorite story- 
book heroines had, but her mother comforted 
her by telling her nearly all light hair turned 
darker as people grew older. 

They squeezed Miss Grant’s hand with their 
soft fingers and nearly every one said — 
“ Oh, it was just splendid in you to ask us, 
and we’ll have a lovely time, I know we 
will ! ” 

There was some sameness in it, but then they 


 

had fixed it up together, which accounted for 
it. 

Then the surrey came and they were bundled 
in. Two were delighted to sit on the front 
seat with Martin. Miss Grant had two with 
her and Miss Jaynes the other two. The beau- 
tiful bays nodded their heads and looked out 
of eyes that almost laughed as they started 
off. 

It was a magnificent October day, warmer 
than it had been. There were still some wood 
asters in bloom, and the wild clematis was 
snowy with the “ Aaron’s beard.” “Bread and 
butter ” was full of glossy round leaves, but 
most of the shrubbery was bare except where 
the Virginia creeper was trailing over it. Elms 
and maples had mostly shed their leaves, but 
the hickories were a blaze of yellow and the 
oaks a coppery brown. Now and then a chest- 
nut showed yellowish brown burs but there had 
not been, frost enough to burst them. 

The road wound in and out — it was not 
much traveled nowadays since a straighter 
one had been cut. In some places there were 
levels where you could look over great fields, 


 

where the shocks of yellow corn were stand- 
ing, or meadows of a second growth where 
cattle grazed. Then some piles of rocks shut 
out the view. On the other side was mostly 
undergrowth. You saw the river, then it dis- 
appeared to come in sight again. The road 
made a curve, but there was a rustic bridge 
over the river. It was quite a detour, then it 
suddenly ran back again. 

“ It’s like Tennyson’s brook,” said Miss 
Grant. 

“Oh!” rejoined the girl on the front seat, 
“ my sister plays and sings that. ‘ I go on for- 
ever, ever,’ ” she hummed. 

“ Mother thought Tennyson was too old for 
us, that it ought to be saved a while yet, all 
except the May Queen. And we always feel 
so sorry she had to die,” and Lois Vail drew 
up closer to Helen. “ But oh, we do like 
Eugene Field and Riley so much! After we 
get the lessons done in the evening and father 
has finished his paper he reads to us.” 

“And you are fond of poetry?” 

“ Oh, it just seems to fill all my heart,” and 
the child sighed. “ I like the things that al- 




most make you cry. Little girls don’t ever 
write verses, do they? ” 

“ Not very often.” 

“ Belle Gordon writes lovely verses, but it is 
mostly when babies die.” 

Miss Gordon was a sentimental girl who had 
already been quite a trial to Miss Grant. 

“ Now, if you want ferns,” Martin halted. 
“ Most of the ground is dry now, we’re almost 
suffering for rain. Do you all want to get 
out ? ” 

Indeed they did, with their two baskets and 
trowels. They laughed and stretched their 
limbs and indulged in joyous exclamations. 

“ Why, it’s almost an island ! ” declared 
Edna March. “If there was only a 
tent ! ” 

It was, indeed, a lovely green island, covered 
with odd feathery grasses and some brown cat- 
tails, and shaded by the tall trees about. “ A 
regular fairy spot,” said Miss Jaynes. 

“Oh! couldn’t we go over?” cried several 
voices. 

“ You’d get wet feet if you did. But it is 
a mighty pretty spot to look at,” said Martin. 



“ And there are a few marshmallows,’ 
espied Miss Jaynes. 

“ Oh ! they look like great silk roses, don’t 
they?” exclaimed Edna. “Aren’t they 
lovely ! ” 

“ I think I can manage them,” said Martin. 

He found a forked stick and drew them 
over, but alas! the lovely pink leaves fell off. 
There was a general exclamation of grief. 

“ ‘ They have had their day and ceased to 
be.’ ”
