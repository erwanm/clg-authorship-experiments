Banff will have a unique reputation among the resorts of the world. If
a judicious plan is formed and adhered to for the development of
its extraordinary beauties and grandeur, it will be second to few in
attractions. A considerable tract of wilderness about it is reserved
as a National Park, and the whole ought to be developed by some master
landscape expert. It is in the power of the Government and of the
Canadian Pacific Company to so manage its already famous curative hot
sulphur springs as to make Banff the resort of invalids as well as
pleasure-seekers the year round. This is to be done not simply by
established good bathing-places, but by regulations and restrictions
such as give to the German baths their virtue.

The Banff Hotel, unsurpassed in situation, amid magnificent mountains,
is large, picturesque, many gabled and windowed, and thoroughly
comfortable. It looks down upon the meeting of the Bow and the Spray,
which spread in a pretty valley closed by a range of snow-peaks. To
right and left rise mountains of savage rock ten thousand feet high. The
whole scene has all the elements of beauty and grandeur. The place
is attractive for its climate, its baths, and excellent hunting and
fishing.

For two days, travelling only by day, passing the Rockies, the Selkirks,
and the Gold range, we were kept in a state of intense excitement, in
a constant exclamation of wonder and delight. I would advise no one
to attempt to take it in the time we did. Nobody could sit through
Beethoven’s nine symphonies played continuously. I have no doubt that
when carriage-roads and foot-paths are made into the mountain recesses,
as they will be, and little hotels are established in the valleys and in
the passes and advantageous sites, as in Switzerland, this region will
rival the Alpine resorts. I can speak of two or three things only.

The highest point on the line is the station at Mount Stephen, 5296
feet above the sea. The mountain, a bald mass of rock in a rounded cone,
rises about 8000 feet above this. As we moved away from it the mountain
was hidden by a huge wooded intervening mountain. The train was speeding
rapidly on the down grade, carrying us away from the base, and we stood
upon the rear platform watching the apparent recession of the great
mass, when suddenly, and yet deliberately, the vast white bulk of Mount
Stephen began to rise over the intervening summit in the blue sky,
lifting itself up by a steady motion while one could count twenty,
until its magnificence stood revealed. It was like a transformation in
a theatre, only the curtain here was lowered instead of raised. The
surprise was almost too much for the nerves; the whole company was
awe-stricken. It is too much to say that the mountain “shot up;” it rose
with conscious grandeur and power. The effect, of course, depends much
upon the speed of the train. I have never seen anything to compare with
it for awakening the emotion of surprise and wonder.

The station of Field, just beyond Mount Stephen, where there is a
charming hotel, is in the midst of wonderful mountain and glacier
scenery, and would be a delightful place for rest. From there the
descent down the canon of Kickinghorse River, along the edge of
precipices, among the snow-monarchs, is very exciting. At Golden we come
to the valley of the Columbia River and in view of the Selkirks. The
river is navigable about a hundred miles above Golden, and this is the
way to the mining district of the Kootenay Valley. The region abounds
in gold and silver. The broad Columbia runs north here until it breaks
through the Selkirks, and then turns southward on the west side of that
range.

The railway follows down the river, between the splendid ranges of the
Selkirks and the Rockies, to the mouth of the Beaver, and then ascends
its narrow gorge. I am not sure but that the scenery of the Selkirks
is finer than that of the Rockies. One is bewildered by the illimitable
noble snow-peaks and great glaciers. At Glacier House is another
excellent hotel. In savage grandeur, nobility of mountain-peaks,
snow-ranges, and extent of glacier it rivals anything in Switzerland.
The glacier, only one arm of which is seen from the road, is, I believe,
larger than any in Switzerland. There are some thirteen miles of flowing
ice; but the monster lies up in the mountains, like a great octopus,
with many giant arms. The branch which we saw, overlooked by the
striking snow-cone of Sir Donald, some two and a half miles from the
hotel, is immense in thickness and breadth, and seems to pour out of the
sky. Recent measurements show that it is moving at the rate of twenty
inches in twenty-four hours—about the rate of progress of the Mer de
Glace. In the midst of the main body, higher up, is an isolated mountain
of pure ice three hundred feet high and nearly a quarter of a mile in
length. These mountains are the home of the mountain sheep.

From this amphitheatre of giant peaks, snow, and glaciers we drop by
marvellous loops—wonderful engineering, four apparently different tracks
in sight at one time—down to the valley of the Illicilliweat, the lower
part of which is fertile, and blooming with irrigated farms. We pass a
cluster of four lovely-lakes, and coast around the great Shuswap Lake,
which is fifty miles long. But the traveller is not out of excitement.
The ride down the Thompson and Fraser canons is as amazing almost as
anything on the line. At Spence’s Bridge we come to the old Government
road to the Cariboo gold-mines, three hundred miles above. This
region has been for a long time a scene of activity in mining and
salmon-fishing. It may be said generally of the Coast or Gold range
that its riches have yet to be developed. The villages all along these
mountain slopes and valleys are waiting for this development.

The city of Vancouver, only two years old since the beginnings of a town
were devoured by fire, is already an interesting place of seven to
eight thousand inhabitants, fast building up, and with many substantial
granite and brick buildings, and spreading over a large area. It lies
upon a high point of land between Burrard Inlet on the north and the
north arm of the Fraser River. The inner harbor is deep and spacious.
Burrard Inlet entrance is narrow but deep, and opens into English Bay,
which opens into Georgia Sound, that separates the island of Vancouver,
three hundred miles long, from the main-land. The round headland south
of the entrance is set apart for a public park, called now Stanley Park,
and is being improved with excellent driving-roads, which give charming
views. It is a tangled wilderness of nearly one thousand acres. So
dense is the undergrowth, in this moist air, of vines, ferns, and small
shrubs, that it looks like a tropical thicket. But in the midst of it
are gigantic Douglas firs and a few noble cedars. One veteran cedar,
partly decayed at the top, measured fifty-six feet in circumference, and
another, in full vigor and of gigantic height, over thirty-nine feet.
The hotel of the Canadian Pacific Company, a beautiful building in
modern style, is, in point of comfort, elegance of appointment, abundant
table, and service, not excelled by any in Canada, equalled by few
anywhere.

Vancouver would be a very busy and promising city merely as the railway
terminus and the shipping-point for Japan and China and the east
generally. But it has other resources of growth. There is a very
good country back of it, and south of it all the way into Washington
Territory. New Westminster, twelve miles south, is a place of importance
for fish and lumber. The immensely fertile alluvial bottoms of the
Fraser, which now overflows its banks, will some day be diked, and
become exceedingly valuable. Its relations to Washington Territory are
already close. The very thriving city of Seattle, having a disagreement
with the North Pacific and its rival, Tacoma, sends and receives most of
its freight and passengers via Vancouver, and is already pushing forward
a railway to that point. It is also building to Spokane Falls, expecting
some time to be met by an extension of the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and
Manitoba from the Great Falls of the Missouri. I found that many of the
emigrants in the loaded trains that we travelled with or that passed
us were bound to Washington Territory. It is an acknowledged fact that
there is a constant “leakage” of emigrants, who had apparently promised
to tarry in Canada, into United States territories. Some of them,
disappointed of the easy wealth expected, no doubt return; but the name
of “republic” seems to have an attraction for Old World people when they
are once set adrift.

We took steamer one afternoon for a five hours sail to Victoria. A part
of the way is among beautiful wooded islands. Once out in the open,
we had a view of our “native land,” and prominent in it the dim,
cloud-like, gigantic peak of Mount Baker. Before we passed the islands
we were entertained by a rare show of right-whales. A school of them a
couple of weeks before had come down through Behring Strait, and pursued
a shoal of fish into this landlocked bay. There must have been as
many as fifty of the monsters in sight, spouting up slender fountains,
lifting their huge bulk out of water, and diving, with their bifurcated
tails waving in the air. They played about like porpoises, apparently
only for our entertainment.

Victoria, so long isolated, is the most English part of Canada. The town
itself does not want solidity and wealth, but it is stationary, and, the
Canadians elsewhere think, slow. It was the dry and dusty time of the
year. The environs are broken with inlets, hilly and picturesque; there
are many pretty cottages and country places in the suburbs; and one
visits with interest the Eskimalt naval station, and the elevated Park,
which has a coble coast view. The very mild climate is favorable for
grapes and apples. The summer is delightful; the winter damp, and
constantly rainy. And this may be said of all this coast. Of the
thirteen thousand population six thousand are Chinese, and they form
in the city a dense, insoluble, unassimilating mass. Victoria has one
railway, that to the prosperous Nanaimo coal-mines. The island has
abundance of coal, some copper, and timber. But Vancouver has taken
away from Victoria all its importance as a port. The Government and
Parliament buildings are detached, but pleasant and commodious edifices.
There is a decorous British air about everything. Throughout British
Columbia the judges and the lawyers wear the gown and band and the
horse-hair wig. In an evening trial for murder which I attended in
a dingy upper chamber of the Kamloops court-house, lighted only by
kerosene lamps, the wigs and gowns of judge and attorneys lent, I
confess, a dignity to the administration of justice which the kerosene
lamps could not have given. In one of the Government buildings is
a capital museum of natural history and geology. The educational
department is vigorous and effective, and I find in the bulky report
evidence of most intelligent management of the schools.

It is only by traversing the long distance to this coast, and seeing the
activity here, that one can appreciate the importance to Canada and to
the British Empire of the Canadian Pacific Railway as a bond of unity,
a developer of resources, and a world’s highway. The out-going steamers
were crowded with passengers and laden with freight. We met on the way
two solid trains, of twenty cars each, full of tea. When the new swift
steamers are put on, which are already heavily subsidized by both the
English and the Canadian governments, the traffic in passengers and
goods must increase. What effect the possession of such a certain line
of communication with her Oriental domains will have upon the English
willingness to surrender Canada either to complete independence or to a
union with the United States, any political prophet can estimate.

It must be added that the Canadian Pacific Company are doing everything
to make this highway popular as well as profitable. Construction and
management show English regard for comfort and safety and order. It is
one of the most agreeable lines to travel over I am acquainted with.
Most of it is well built, and defects are being energetically removed.
The “Colonist” cars are clean and convenient. The first class carriages
are luxurious. The dining-room cars are uniformly well kept, the company
hotels are exceptionally excellent; and from the railway servants one
meets with civility and attention.




III.

I had been told that the Canadians are second-hand Englishmen. No
estimate could convey a more erroneous impression. A portion of the
people have strong English traditions and loyalties to institutions, but
in manner and in expectations the Canadians are scarcely more English
than the people of the United States; they have their own colonial
development, and one can mark already with tolerable distinctness a
Canadian type which is neither English nor American. This is noticeable
especially in the women. The Canadian girl resembles the American in
escape from a purely conventional restraint and in self-reliance,
and she has, like the English, a well-modulated voice and distinct
articulation. In the cities, also, she has taste in dress and a certain
style which we think belongs to the New World. In features and action
a certain modification has gone on, due partly to climate and partly to
greater social independence. It is unnecessary to make comparisons, and
I only note that there is a Canadian type of woman.

But there is great variety in Canada, and in fact a remarkable racial
diversity. The man of Nova Scotia is not at all the man of British
Columbia or Manitoba. The Scotch in old Canada have made a distinct
impression in features and speech. And it may be said generally in
eastern Canada that the Scotch element is a leading and conspicuous one
in the vigor and push of enterprise and the accumulation of fortune.
The Canadian men, as one sees them in official life, at the clubs, in
business, are markedly a vigorous, stalwart race, well made, of good
stature, and not seldom handsome. This physical prosperity needs to be
remembered when we consider the rigorous climate and the long winters;
these seem to have at least one advantage—that of breeding virile men.
The Canadians generally are fond of out-door sports and athletic games,
of fishing and hunting, and they give more time to such recreations
than we do. They are a little less driven by the business goad. Abundant
animal spirits tend to make men good-natured and little quarrelsome. The
Canadians would make good soldiers. There was a time when the drinking
habit pervaded very much in Canada, and there are still places where
they do not put water enough in their grog, but temperance reform has
taken as strong a hold there as it has in the United States.

The feeling about the English is illustrated by the statement that there
is not more aping of English ways in Montreal and Toronto clubs and
social life than in New York, and that the English superciliousness, or
condescension as to colonists, the ultra-English manner, is ridiculed
in Canada, and resented with even more warmth than in the United States.
The amusing stories of English presumption upon hospitality are current
in Canada as well as on this side. All this is not inconsistent with
pride in the empire, loyalty to its traditions and institutions, and
even a considerable willingness (for human nature is pretty much alike
everywhere) to accept decorative titles. But the underlying fact is that
there is a distinct feeling of nationality, and it is increasing.

There is not anywhere so great a contrast between neighboring cities as
between Quebec, Montreal, and Toronto. Quebec is mediæval, Toronto is
modern, Montreal is in a conflict between the two conditions. As the
travelling world knows, they are all interesting cities, and have
peculiar attractions. Quebec is French, more decidedly so than Toronto
is English, and in Montreal the French have a large numerical majority
and complete political control. In the Canadian cities generally
municipal affairs are pretty much divorced from general party politics,
greatly to the advantage of good city government.

Montreal has most wealth, and from its splendid geographical position it
is the railway centre, and has the business and commercial primacy. It
has grown rapidly from a population of 140,000 in 1881 to a population
of over 200,000—estimated, with its suburbs, at 250,000. Were it part of
my plan to describe these cities, I should need much space to devote
to the finest public buildings and public institutions of Montreal, the
handsome streets in the Protestant quarter, with their solid, tasteful,
and often elegant residences, the many churches, and the almost
unequalled possession of the Mountain as a park and resort, where one
has the most striking and varied prospects in the world. Montreal, being
a part of the province of Quebec, is not only under provincial control
of the government at Quebec, but it is ruled by the same French party
in the city, and there is the complaint always found where the poorer
majority taxes the richer and more enterprising minority out of
proportion to the benefits the latter receives. Various occasions
have produced something like race conflicts in the city, and there
are prophesies of more serious ones in the strife for ascendency. The
seriousness of this to the minority lies in the fact that the French
race is more prolific than any other in the province.

Perhaps nothing will surprise the visitor more than the persistence of
the French type in Canada, and naturally its aggressiveness. Guaranteed
their religion, laws, and language, the French have not only failed to
assimilate, but have had hopes—maybe still have—of making Canada French.
The French “national” party means simply a French consolidation, and has
no relation to the “nationalism” of Sir John Macdonald. So far as the
Church and the French politicians are concerned, the effort is to
keep the French solid as a political force, and whether the French are
Liberal or Conservative, this is the underlying thought. The province of
Quebec is Liberal, but the liberalism is of a different hue from that of
Ontario. The French recognize the truth that language is so integral
a part of a people’s growth that the individuality of a people depends
upon maintaining it. The French have escaped absorption in Canada mainly
by loyalty to their native tongue, aided by the concession to them
of their civil laws and their religious privileges. They owe this to
William Pitt. I quote from a contributed essay in the Toronto Week about
three years ago: “Up to 1791 the small French population of Canada was
in a position to be converted into an English colony with traces of
French sentiment and language, which would have slowly disappeared. But
at that date William Pitt the younger brought into the House of Commons
two Quebec Acts, which constituted two provinces—Lower Canada, with a
full provision of French laws, language, and institutions; Upper Canada,
with a reproduction of English laws and social system. During the debate
Pitt declared on the floor of the House that his purpose was to create
two colonies distinct from and jealous of each other, so as to guard
against a repetition of the late unhappy rebellion which had separated
the thirteen colonies from the empire.”

The French have always been loyal to the English connection under all
temptations, for these guarantees have been continued, which could
scarcely be expected from any other power, and certainly not in a
legislative union of the Canadian provinces. In literature and sentiment
the connection is with France; in religion, with Rome; in politics
England has been the guarantee of both. There will be no prevailing
sentiment in favor of annexation to the United States so long as
the Church retains its authority, nor would it be favored by the
accomplished politicians so long as they can use the solid French mass
as a political force.

The relegation of the subject of education entirely to the provinces
is an element in the persistence of the French type in the province
of Quebec, in the same way that it strengthens the Protestant cause
in Ontario. In the province of Quebec all the public schools are Roman
Catholic, and the separate schools are of other sects. In the council of
public instruction the Catholics, of course, have a large majority, but
the public schools are managed by a Catholic committee and the others
by a Protestant committee. In the academies, model and high schools,
subsidized by the Government, those having Protestant teachers are
insignificant in number, and there are very few Protestants in Catholic
schools, and very few Catholics in Protestant schools; the same is true
of the schools of this class not subsidized. The bulky report of the
superintendent of public instruction of the province of Quebec (which is
translated into English) shows a vigorous and intelligent attention
to education. The general statistics give the number of pupils in the
province as 219,403 Roman Catholics (the term always used in the report)
and 37,484 Protestants. In the elementary schools there are 143,848
Roman Catholics and 30,401 Protestants. Of the ecclesiastical teachers,
808 are Roman Catholics and 8 Protestants; of the certificated lay
teachers, 250 are Roman Catholic and 105 Protestant; the proportion
of schools is four to one. It must be kept in mind that in the French
schools it is French literature that is cultivated. In the Laval
University, at Quebec, English literature is as purely an ornamental
study as French literature would be in Yale. The Laval University, which
has a branch in Montreal, is a strong institution, with departments of
divinity, law, medicine, and the arts, 80 professors, and 575
students. The institution has a vast pile of buildings, one of the most
conspicuous objects in a view of the city. Besides spacious lecture,
assembly rooms, and laboratories, it has extensive collections in
geology, mineralogy, botany, ethnology, zoology, coins, a library
of 100,000 volumes, in which theology is well represented, but which
contains a large collection of works on Canada, including valuable
manuscripts, the original MS. of the Journal des Jésuites, and the most
complete set of the Relation des Jésuites existing in America. It has
also a gallery of paintings, chiefly valuable for its portraits.

Of the 62,000 population of Quebec City, by the census of 1881, not over
6000 were Protestants. By the same census Montreal had 140,747, of whom
78,684 were French, and 28,995 of Irish origin. The Roman Catholics
numbered 103,579. I believe the proportion has not much changed with the
considerable growth in seven years.

One is struck, in looking at the religious statistics of Canada, by
the fact that the Church of England has not the primacy, and that the
so-called independent sects have a position they have not in England.
In the total population of 4,324,810, given by the census of 1881,
the Protestants were put down at 2,436,554 and the Roman Catholics at
1,791,982. The larger of the Protestant denominations were, Methodists,
742,981; Presbyterians, 676,165; Church of England, 574,818; Baptists,
296,525. Taking as a specimen of the north-west the province of
Manitoba, census of 1886, we get these statistics of the larger sects:
Presbyterians, 28,406; Church of England, 23,206; Methodists, 18,648;
Roman Catholics, 14,651; Mennonites, 9112; Baptists, 3296; Lutherans,
3131.

Some statistics of general education in the Dominion show the popular
interest in the matter. In 1885 the total number of pupils in the
Dominion, in public and private schools, was 908,193, and the average
attendance was 555,404. The total expenditure of the year, not including
school buildings, was $9,310,745, and the value of school lands,
buildings, and furniture was $25,000,000. Yet in the province of Quebec,
out of the total expenditure of $3,102,410, only $353,077 was granted by
the provincial Legislature. And in Ontario, of the total of $3,904,797,
only $267,084 was granted by the Legislature.

The McGill University at Montreal, Sir William Dawson principal, is
a corporation organized under royal charter, which owes its original
endowment of land and money (valued at $120,000) to James McGill. It
receives small grants from the provincial and Dominion governments, but
mainly depends upon its own funds, which in 1885 stood at $791,000. It
has numerous endowed professorships and endowments for scholarships and
prizes; among them is the Donalda Endowment for the Higher Education of
Women (from Sir Donald A. Smith), by which a special course in separate
classes, by University professors, is maintained in the University
buildings for women. It has faculties of arts, applied sciences, law,
and medicine—the latter with one of the most complete anatomical museums
and one of the best selected libraries on the continent. It has several
colleges affiliated with it for the purpose of conferring
University degrees, a model school, and four theological colleges, a
Congregational, a Presbyterian, an Episcopalian, and a Wesleyan, the
students in which may supplement their own courses in the University.
The professors and students wear the University cap and gown, and
morning prayers are read to a voluntary attendance. The Redpath Museum,
of geology, mineralogy, zoology, and ethnology, has a distinction
among museums not only for the size of the collection, but for splendid
arrangement and classification. The well-selected library numbers about
30,000 volumes. The whole University is a vigorous educational centre,
and its well-planted grounds and fine buildings are an ornament to the
city.

Returning to the French element, its influence is not only felt in the
province of Quebec, but in the Dominion. The laws of the Dominion and
the proceedings are published in French and English; the debates in
the Dominion Parliament are conducted indifferently in both languages,
although it is observed that as the five years of any Parliament go on
English is more and more used by the members, for the French are more
likely to learn English than the English are to learn French. Of course
the Quebec Parliament is even more distinctly French. And the power of
the Roman Catholic Church is pretty much co-extensive with the language.
The system of tithes is legal in provincial law, and tithes can be
collected of all Roman Catholics by law. The Church has also what is
called the fabrique system; that is, a method of raising contributions
from any district for churches, priests’ houses, and conventual
buildings and schools. The tithes and the fabrique assessments make a
heavy burden on the peasants. The traveller down the St. Lawrence sees
how the interests of religion are emphasized in the large churches
raised in the midst of humble villages, and in the great Church
establishments of charity and instruction. It is said that the farmers
attempted to escape the tithe on cereals by changing to the cultivation
of pease, but the Church then decided that pease were cereals. There is
no doubt that the French population are devout, and that they support
the Church in proportion to their devotion, and that much which seems
to the Protestants extortion on the part of the Church is a voluntary
contribution. Still the fact remains that the burden is heavy on land
that is too cold for the highest productiveness. The desire to better
themselves in wages, and perhaps to escape burdens, sends a great many
French to New England. Some of them earn money, and return to settle in
the land that is dear by tradition and a thousand associations. Many do
not return, and I suppose there are over three-quarters of a million
of French Canadians now in New England. They go to better themselves,
exactly as New Englanders leave their homes for more productive farms in
the West. The Church, of course, does not encourage this emigration,
but does encourage the acquisition of lands in Ontario or elsewhere
in Canada. And there has been recently a marked increase of French
in Ontario—so marked that the French representation in the Ontario
Parliament will be increased probably by three members in the next
election. There are many people in Canada who are seriously alarmed at
this increase of the French and of the Roman Catholic power. Others look
upon this fear as idle, and say that immigration is sure to make the
Protestant element overwhelming. It is to be noted also that Ontario
furnishes Protestant emigrants to the United States in large numbers. It
may be that the interchange of ideas caused by the French emigration
to New England will be an important make-weight in favor of annexation.
Individuals, and even French newspapers, are found to advocate it. But
these are at present only surface indications. The political leaders,
the Church, and the mass of the people are fairly content with things as
they are, and with the provincial autonomy, although they resent federal
vetoes, and still make a “cry” of the Riel execution.

The French element in Canada may be considered from other points of
view. The contribution of romance and tradition is not an unimportant
one in any nation. The French in Canada have never broken with their
past, as the French in France have. There is a great charm about
Quebec—its language, its social life, the military remains of the last
century. It is a Protestant writer who speaks of the volume and
wealth of the French Canadian literature as too little known to
English-speaking Canada. And it is true that literary men have not
realized the richness of the French material, nor the work accomplished
by French writers in history, poetry, essays, and romances. Quebec
itself is at a commercial stand-still, but its uniquely beautiful
situation, its history, and the projection of mediævalism into existing
institutions make it one of the most interesting places to the tourist
on the continent. The conspicuous, noble, and commodious Parliament
building is almost the only one of consequence that speaks of the modern
spirit. It was the remark of a high Church dignitary that the object of
the French in Canada was the promotion of religion, and the object
of the English, commerce. We cannot overlook this attitude against
materialism. In the French schools and universities religion is not
divorced from education. And even in the highest education, where modern
science has a large place, what we may call the literary side is very
much emphasized. Indeed, the French students are rather inclined to
rhetoric, and in public life the French are distinguished for the
graces and charm of oratory. It may be true, as charged, that the public
schools of Quebec province, especially in the country, giving special
attention to the interest the Church regards as the highest, do little
to remove the ignorance of the French peasant. It is our belief that
the best Christianity is the most intelligent. Yet there is matter for
consideration with all thoughtful men what sort of society we shall
ultimately have in States where the common schools have neither
religious nor ethical teaching.

Ottawa is a creation of the Federal Government as distinctly as
‘Washington is. The lumber-mills on the Chaudière Falls necessitate a
considerable town here, for this industry assumes gigantic proportions,
but the beauty and attraction of the city are due to the concentration
here of political interest. The situation on the bluffs of the Ottawa
River is commanding, and gives fine opportunity for architectural
display. The group of Government buildings is surpassingly fine. The
Parliament House and the department buildings on three sides of a square
are exceedingly effective in color and in the perfection of Gothic
