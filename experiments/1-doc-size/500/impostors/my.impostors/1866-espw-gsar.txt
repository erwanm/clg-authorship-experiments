Peace Maythorne’s room, with its golden sunlight 
and its quiet face, was a sort of tabernacle 
to Gypsy. It hushed her and helped her as 
nothing else ever did. It reduced all her wild 
plans to order. It rebuked her mad impulses 
and thoughtless words. It taught her how best 
to work and hope for Tom. It made the new- 
ness and the strangeness of her trouble easier 
to bear. Most of all, the pitiful contrast of it 
with the pleasant places into which her own 
lines had fallen, silenced all grumbling, made 
her very thankful. She had depended more on 
Peace of late, since she had been troubled for 
Tom, and since those headaches of her mother’s 
had begun to be so frequent. Almost all of 


her anxiety and perplexity had been shared with 
Peace ; as she said, she could not very well 
help it. But when Tom had been back at college
a few weeks, something new came up, 
which she did not tell her nor any one. The 
reasons for this she could hardly have explained ; 
but she felt very sure that she preferred to keep 
it to herself. 

It was a letter from Tom. A short letter, 
very pleasant, like all Tom’s letters, and at first 
sight a very unimportant one : — 

Dear Gypsy, — Am hurried to death over 
my Euclid, and can’t write much this morning. 
My stand is better than last term, but it might 
be decidedly higher yet. I flunked dead in 
Euclid yesterday, and that is why I mean to 
study to-day on it. 

How is it about those headaches of mother’s? 
Father sent me a package of new-style French 
envelopes from the store the other day ; very 
good in him, and I am, his affectionately, T. Did 
you see Winnie’s letter to me that mother wrote 


for him? It contained the extraordinary information 
that you had smashed potatoes for dinner, 
and I couldn’t have any ; that he was five years 
old, and that Tom had gone to college. Hall’s 
sister hasn’t written to him but once since he has 
been back. Your two letters a week are jolly. 
Sometimes when I haven’t anything to do, I take 
them out and read them all over. We had a 
tip-top rush with the Sophs yesterday, — beat 
them, of course. A fellow in our house has got 
into a row with one of the Profs., and will be 
rusticated to pay for it. 

Love to all. I must go to cramming now on 
that Euclid. Hall opened a bottle of Old Yriarte 
last night, and it was tough work looking on and 
being laughed at ; but a promise is a promise. 

Very respectfully, your ob’t servant, 

T. Breynton. 

P. S. See here. I wonder if you have a little 
money you could lend a fellow for a few weeks. 
The state of my finances is somewhat precarious, 
and I don’t dare to go to father just yet; he 
won’t expect me to need more before the middle 
of the term. I hate to ask you, but the truth is 



there was a little bet with Hall, — about four 
dollars ; it was about a girl we met on Chapel 
Street, and I said if he bowed to her without an 
introduction, she wouldn’t return it, and I felt 

sure of winning (only I wouldn’t have taken the 
money) ; but she wasn’t the lady she looked, and 
she bowed, and I lost. Now the bother of it is. 
Hall wants his money, and I haven’t it to give 
him ; I have some left, but it is due at the hatter’s 
this week. I feel real mean asking you, 
and you shall have your money back just as soon 
as father hands over. It is mean to bet, — yes, 
I know it without your telling me. I don’t very 
often do it. I shall keep clear of it after this. 
If you will help me out of this scrape and keep 
dark about it to father, you will be as good a 
sister as ever luckless scamp was blessed with. 
Please send as soon as possible. 

Gypsy locked up the letter in her desk where 
no one could see it, and sat down and thought 
about it. 

Tom had done wrong, — yes. But he was 
sorry, and the money must be paid in some 
way. She did not care in the least about keep- 
ing her money, if she could get him out of the 
difficulty, and perhaps prevent his doing the 




same thing again. Certainly, if she refused, it 
would seem selfish and mean, and Tom would 
be vexed, and there would be an end of her 
influence over him. Moreover, her money was 
her own, and she was always allowed to spend 
it as she chose. 

But was it quite right to do it and tell no- 
body? To tell her father was out of the ques- 
tion. Her mother was locked into her room 
with a violent sick-headache. There was no one 
to tell. It seemed to be quite right, she 
thought. Poor Tom ! If he only would not 
get into so much trouble ! 

That very night a note was on its way to him. 

Dear Tom, — Here are four dollars. It 
is all I have, and you are welcome to it, only 
I ’m so sorry. I hate bets. Mother would 
feel badly, I ’m afraid, iC she knew. She ’s 
real sick to-day. 

Your loving 

Gypsy. 

By return of mail came Tom’s answer. 



Dear G., — You’re a diamond. I did not 
mean to take all you had. I promise you this 
is the last of my heavy betting. You are a 
good girl, and treat me better than I deserve, 
and make me ashamed of myself. T. 

And did she do just right? Perhaps one can 
hardly judge without being exactly in her place. 
Certainly the cases are rare in which it would 
be best for a girl to pay her brother’s wrong- 
fully contracted debts without her parents’ 
knowledge. The circumstances were peculiar, 
and whether she acted prudently or not, her 
motive was a noble and generous one. It was 
the nobleness and the generosity which touched 
Tom; which roused in him a fresh throb of love 
for her, and another good resolve. 

Two seeds worth sowing, certainly. 




ONE day Gypsy was walking home from 
school with Sarah Rowe and Delia Guest, 
after the fashion of very young ladies, — with 
their arms interlaced about each other’s waists, 
chatting in the most confidential manner (it 
sounded very much like canary birds chirping) 
about blue ribbons and pink ribbons, bead nets 
and magic ruffles, flounces and tucks and spotted 
veils and a bewilderment of other abstruse 
subjects, — when a buggy drawn by a white 
horse drove furiously by. All at once the 
chirping stopped. 

“Why, Gypsy, that’s your father!” 


“ My father? Where? What? I didn’t see.” 

“ No, she was looking the other way. 
There, — in that buggy; he ’s most out of sight 
now. I wonder what he was driving so for ! ” 

“ Why, that is our buggy, sure enough ; and 
Billy, — I can always tell Billy because his tail 
is so short. Well, I never did see father drive 
like that before. I guess Tom would laugh.” 

“ Why, look ! he ’s turned off High Street.” 

“ You can sec him through the trees.” 

“Why! He’s stopped at — ” 

“ The doctor s !" 

Gypsy turned first red and then pale, and 
before the girls could say another word to her 
she had sprung away from them and was run- 
ning up the street, and was out of sight around 
the corner. 

She flew away like a bird, and reached the 
garden fence and climbed it, and bounded 
through the drifts, and rushed into the house, 
her hat hanging down her neck, her breath 
gone. In the entry she stopped. The house 
was very still. 




“ Mother ! ” 

Nobody answered. 

“ Mother ! Mother ! Winnie ! ” 

But nobody answered that. She sprang up 
the stairs two at a time, and into her mother’s 
room. Winnie was curled up in the corner, 
looking very much frightened ; Patty was stepping 
about the room, doing something with 
blankets and hot water. Mrs. Breynton was 
lying on the bed ; she was heavily muffled in 
the clothing, but she was shivering from head 
to foot; her cheeks were scarlet, and her eyes 
looked wild and unnatural. 

Gypsy stood still, very much frightened. 

“ It ’s the chills she 's got,” said Patty, in a 
whisper ; “ she was took sudden, and yer 

fayther ’s gone for the docther ; may the Houly 
Mother presarve her, fur it ’s the sisther of me 
as was took the like o’ that, and was buried in a 
week, an’ tin small children lift widout a mither 
till their fayther married ’em one nixt month ; 
may the saints rest her soul ! ” 

Gypsy took off her things softly, sent Winnie 



downstairs, quieted Patty’s heavy tread, and 
busied herself in doing what she could until the 
doctor came. She knew nothing about sickness, 
and she was thoroughly frightened by her 
mother’s looks. Mrs. Breynton scarcely no- 
ticed her, but tossed feverishly upon the pillow, 
asking now and then what could make the room 
so cold, and why the doctor did not come. 
Gypsy concluded that she must be kept quiet as 
well as warm ; so she finally dispensed with 
Patty, who was doing her noisy best, and had 
knocked over the washstand and three chairs 
within five minutes. When Mr. Breynton 
came in with the doctor, they found Gypsy sole 
nurse. “ She had arranged things with a 
womanliness and tact that were wonderful,” her 
father said afterwards. “ She must have been 
very much frightened, but she certainly did 
not show it. She was as gentle and thought- 
ful about the room as her mother might have 
been herself. I am sure I never supposed 
Gypsy capable of it, she is such a fly-away 
child.” 


Fever, — yes, the doctor said. He could 
not tell with certainty of what sort, — typhus, 
very likely ; it had been in the system a long 
time. Had the patient been subject to headaches 
of late? Yes? He thought so. Yes, yes, 
he understood matters. Aconite once every 
half-hour till the pulse was brought down. 

“Is she going to be very sick?” asked 
Gypsy, following him down to the door. The 
doctor shook his head mysteriously, and said 
that it was impossible to tell. He had seen 
enough of typhus fevers in his day, and he 
did not care to see any more. He hoped she 
would get through it. 

He was a thin little man, with a melancholy 
voice and lugubrious whiskers, and a remarkable
way of smiling as if he had been telling 
her some excellent joke. Take him altogether, 
he in no wise enlivened Gypsy’s spirits. 

Hard days came after that. Mrs. Breynton 
grew worse and grew worse. The doctor 
shook his head and folded his powders, and 
called it an obstinate case, and meantime she 


kept growing worse. Gypsy came out of 
school, put away her books, put on her slippers 
and a white apron, and went into the sick-room. 
She became the most delightful little nurse one 
could desire to have about, — gentle, quiet, 
thoughtful, quick to see what was wanted before 
it was asked for, a perfect sunbeam, keeping all 
her terrible fear to herself, and regular as a 
clock with the medicines. It was really curious. 
People looked on and said, “ What has become 
of blundering Gypsy?” But, after all, it was 
not hard to explain. Her love for her mother, 
like her love for Tom, sobered her. When 
Gypsy was very much iu earnest, she could think. 

The best thing about her was her cheery way 
of hoping for the best; it is doubtful if her 
father once suspected that it was any more than 
the trustful ignorance of a light-hearted child, 
or that she had the least comprehension of the 
danger. But once, when she had been sent 
out to get the air, and had stolen away — a very 
quiet and pale little Gypsy — to Peace May- 
thorne, it all came out in a sudden, low cry : 


“ Peace Maythorne, don’t I know how sick 
she is? And not to dare to think I know, not 
to darCy Peace ! ” 

And Peace drew her right down into her 
arms and let her cry. 

Oh, yes, the days were hard. The doubt 
and suspense of them, the terrible helplessness 
and idle watching, the fears of one day bright- 
ening into hopes the next and fading into fears 
again, — there lay the sting. “ She is better 
to-day, — surely she is a little better.” “ Not 
so well to-day, and the doctor’s face is grave. 
But she will have a better night, and to-morrow, 
— yes, she must be better to-morrow.” And 
to-morrow would come, and she would be no 
better. It used to seem to Gypsy that if they 
were going to lose her, -it would be far easier to 
know it and face it. 

There was once that her courage gave way, 
and in genuine Gypsy fashion she blundered 
into saying something which might have led to 
serious consequences. 


It was just at twilight of one of Mrs. Brcyn- 
ton’s worst days. Her husband had been called 
away to the store ; Mrs. Rowe, who had been 
with her a part of the day, had gone home to 
supper, and the night watcher had not yet come. 
Gypsy was left alone with her, and she was 
sitting silently on a cricket by the hearth, waiting 
for any sound or motion from the bed. She 
thought that her mother was asleep, and was 
startled by hearing her speak suddenly, and in 
a more quiet and natural voice than she had 
had all day : — 

“ Gypsy, what is the matter? ” 

Gypsy drew back into the shadow, vexed 
with herself for having let the firelight fall on 
her tear-stained face. 

“ Come here a minute, Gypsy.” 

Gypsy went up to the bed, and knelt on the 
floor beside it, laying her face down by her 
mother’s hand. 

“ Now tell me what you were crying about, 
my child.” 

“ Oh, nothing, mother ; that is to say. 



nothing that — I mean, nothing you ought 
to know,” began Gypsy, choking down the 
sobs. 

“Were you crying about me?” 

Mrs. Breynton’s voice had that weak, appealing 
accent so often heard in the voices of the 
sick, and which it is so hard to hear in the 
voices of those we love ; and when she spoke, 
she laid her hand — it had grown pitifully thin 
and white — softly upon Gypsy’s bowed head. 
It was too much for Gypsy. She broke into a 
sudden cry, and the bitter, incoherent words 
tumbled forth one upon another, half drowned 
in her sobbing. 

“ O mother, mother, I was afraid — I was 
thinking — what shall I do if you don’t get 
well? O mother, mother, mother!” Gypsy 
instantly knew what she had done. She sprang 
to her feet in terror. What would her father 
say? and the doctor? How could she have 
done it? How could she? 

But the quiet, natural voice spoke up again, 
very cpiietly and very naturally, and her mother 


drew her face down upon the pillows, and tried 
to hush her sobs. 

“Never mind, Gypsy; you have done no 
harm. I know better than any one else how 
sick I am. And I am glad this has happened, 
for there is something I have wanted to say 
to you. Only, my child, please don’t cry so 
hard.’’ 

Gypsy understood that it was time for her 
to stop, and she stopped. 

“ If the end is coming,’’ said her mother, 
gently, — “I don’t seem to feel that it is 
yet, — but if it should, Gypsy, there is 
Tom.’’ 

Gypsy nestled closer to her on the pillow for 
answer. 

“ Gypsy, Tom must grow up a good man. I 
cannot have it any other way. But it will 
depend more on you than any other human being. 
A sister who will always love him, be gentle 
with him, be patient with him, be womanly and 
generous for him, teach him that he is a great 
deal dearer to her than she is to herself, — if he 


has no mother, Gypsy, he must have that 
sister.” 

Gypsy raised her head, her tears quite gone, 
and said, speaking very solemnly, — 

“ Mother, whether you live or whether you 
die, I will be that sister.” 

That promise, made in the dim light of the 
sick-room, with the shadows nodding on the 
walls, and the shadow of the poor thin face 
beside her on the pillow, Gypsy will never 
forget. 

But God was merciful, and she did not die ; 
and if she had. He would have been merciful 
still. To no one in the family was the experience
of those few weeks what it was to Gypsy. 
For the first time in her life she had looked into 
an open grave ; — for we never know nor can 
know what the words mean until we see one 
waiting for us or ours; — for the first time in 
her life she had felt that any one very dear to 
her coitld die and life go on, and the future 
come, with always a face in it to be missed, and 
a touch to be longed for. For the first time in 



her life, too, she had found out what it was to 
be very thankful; to fall on her knees with 
hidden face, the happy words dying on her 
lips for wonder that God should choose her for 
such rich blessing. 

Many times in these days she thought of 
her cousin Joy and her motherless life. She 
thought that she had understood it before, but 
now she found that she never had. She wrote 
to Joy once and told her so. 

But the fever had done its work thoroughly, 
and Mrs. Breynton did not recover as fast as 
they had hoped. She seemed to be very much 
shattered by it, and it was many weeks before 
she was able to leave her bed. After the 
watchers had been given up, and the nurses 
had gone, and the neighbours began to come 
in less frequently to offer help, Gypsy was busy 
enough. And it was then that there came the 
trial to her patience and good temper. She 
must be nurse, and she must be housekeeper; 
she must look after Winnie, — and it did seem 
as if that young gentleman made it a serious 

study to require looking after at least once in
