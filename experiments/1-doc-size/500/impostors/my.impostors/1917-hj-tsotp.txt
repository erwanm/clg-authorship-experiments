erally chinked to his ear, and he saw, the next 
thing, that they chinked to his companion's as 
well which circumstance somehow made them 
on the instant a perfect mine of wealth. "How 
much, how much will you have?" he was ac 
cordingly justified in gaily asking and that 
even while it also played into his exquisite agita 
tion that the Midmores in general had probably 
ever held the rattle of one's resources in any 
pocket a vulgar mode of allusion to them. He 
was so brightly in earnest with his offer, and so 
interesting it grew and grew each instant to him 
self, that he would have been willing they should 
take it for an American freedom caught in the 
fact. So if it was one it should be a great one, 
and Ralph kept this up. "You've only to say, 
you know!" Perry, his head half bent with his 
trouble, gazed with a bovine air as from over a 
fence and under his brows while Ralph felt such 
surprise, after an instant, at the degree of his 
difficulty, which suggested positive physical pain, 
that superlative soothing seemed none too much. 
His personal confidence moreover had at the 
first fine touch of his fortune shot straight up, 
and he rose with it to an extraordinary height. 
"I want you to understand, you see, that there's 
really no sum you mayn't name -!" And he 
chinked and chinked. 

Perry's breath, as it had more than once done 





  

before, came shorter and shorter, but he still 
stood off. "You carry all your fortune about 
you?" 

"Not all only a goodish handful, but a clutch 
can follow a clutch' And he so liked his clutch 
that he drew it forth and held it high, shaking 
it in the air and laughing. "Guess what this 
alone comes to." 

Perry glared up at the hidden treasure the 
effort of Ralph's hand completely contained it, 
but as our young man was about to say, "Mayn't 
I count it down to you ? " the wondering eyes 
shifted, resting at once, Ralph saw, on another 
object. He heard nothing, and his back was to 
the door from the hall, which Perry would have 
seen noiselessly opened and with the effect of an 
appeal for admission. Ralph watched his face, 
but waited before turning, waited as if some 
thing hung on it, and only advised somehow by 
what he noted to lower his fist and restore it 
slowly to his pocket. And then Perry had spoken. 
"If you've come up for your share, my dear, he 
vows he's all ready to put it on the table, and 
you can be served first if you like." 

The whole passage, however, was otherwise so 
soundless that Ralph listened a full minute for 
the answer to this remark before facing about. 


THE girl was for the time stillness incarnate; she 
carried the burden of what she had done very 
much after the fashion of a glass filled to the 
brim, held out at arm's length and sure to over 
flow at the first jostle. What she had been mutely 
doing as she stood there must have been to beg 
her brother to refrain from any word that would 
make her position more awkward, and that she 
felt some confidence for this might have appeared, 
the next instant, in her large grave look at his 
companion, which struck Ralph as a sign of greet 
ing the most intended, and yet at the same time 
the shyest, ever made him. She might scarce 
have expected recognition, but she seemed to take 
him in with so little felt restriction on staring 
that he measured at once the relief she enjoyed 
at finding him only with Perry. She had been 
wound up, he felt, for something more difficult, 
and now this was blest, was a reprieve, for he 
was quickly certain that with Perry she could 
easily deal all the more that what he had just 
said to her wasn't the deprecated jog, inasmuch 
as it didn't at all reflect upon her, but reflected 
only on their cousin. Ralph had in her presence 
still a couple more of extraordinarily swift re 
flections one of these perhaps the very most 





  

immediate, in its sweetness and clearness, that 
had visited his consciousness of these rich hours 
and bearing upon the fact exactly that he was her 
cousin, hers much more for instance than Molly's, 
in respect to whom the nature of the relative was 
swallowed up in the nature of the lover; bearing 
on it so happily that in the course of another 
moment he had brought out the beautiful sense 
in his own greeting, which had the effect of read 
ing into hers everything either he or she could 
have desired. He didn't grin for this, as he had 
been doing for Perry he breathed it softly, but 
ever so gravely: "Cousin, cousin, cousin!" 
though after it too, with the same gravity, which 
yet, as he felt even in uttering the words, was a 
perfect extravagance: "Isn't it great, great?" 

"Great that we're cousins 'great'?" It had 
broken her stillness happily and, as he figured, 
without the jostle of her arm; for again it not 
only left her intrusion ideally unchallenged, but 
instantly gave it such importance of ground as 
could in no way whatever be taken from it. 

"Well, what  call great," he returned in the 
liveliest promptitude of explanation; well aware, 
on the second thought, that it was one of the 
wrong kinds of turns, one of those that had made 
the rest of the family exchange wonderments, 
but eager, within the moment, to be able to judge 
whether it hadn't perhaps even positively pleased 
her. 





  

"He calls things in such ways as you've never 
heard," Perry declared to her as for further and 
possibly still more convenient information; which 
Ralph, rejoicing at the comparative sociability 
of it, straightway took up. 

"Of course I do, I know it at once as soon as 
I've done it, know it by the sound after, after, 
don't you see?" he addressed the earnest em 
phasis only to the girl. "Of course we have dif 
ferent expressions but I'm going to make you 
like them. I'm going to make you understand 
them," he explained in the most serious way. 

The happiest thing was that though her ap 
pearance had determined in him this sudden 
earnestness, the confidence shown in her and so 
quickly heaped up made her break into a smile. 
"I'm not supposed to understand unless I very 
much want to. Therefore She only 

smiled, but it gave Ralph an immediate chance. 

"Therefore it's clear that you want to so far 
as I'm concerned; which it's a grand comfort 
to feel for I'm not in the least afraid." 

"What have you to be afraid of?" she asked 
with a readiness that made her brother break in 
before Ralph could reply. 

"You understand between you then, damme, 
things that I don't!" Which comment, looking 
from one to the other, he at once and most 
surprisingly backed up. "You've smashed the 
great jar at Drydown, and he already knows 

 

it, and that you've come up to make your con 
fession." 

"Oh I don't in the least know that I" Ralph 
declared. "What I should like to believe," he 
said to the girl, "is that you've wanted so to see 
your new kinsman that you've risked the adven 
ture." His rejoicing gravity was at such a pitch 
in it that she turned, under this address, from 
pale to red, and that something in the expression 
thus produced in her, which was like a rush of 
some purer intelligence than he had yet touched 
among them all, determined in him the strangest 
inward cry. "Why she's modern, modern I" 
he felt he was thinking and it seemed to launch 
him with one push on an extraordinary sea. He 
in fact wouldn't have been sure the next moment 
whether he hadn't uttered the queer words, queer, 
in their sense, even to his own apprehension; 
though he was afterwards to take it that they 
had appeared to find no echo, even if he had him 
self kept on knowing for the moment more or 
less what he meant by them. 

What he meant and what if the air had vibrated 
to them they would vividly have signified was 
the very aspect and figure of this slight, fine, con 
centrated little person, who suffered this last 
measure mainly indeed as an offered contrast to 
her splendid sister, and whose appearance was 
of a fashion so different from any that either 
Molly or their mother might have set her that 





  

she affected him as linked to them but in the de 
gree of one of those sacrificed creatures he had 
read of in records of the old Catholic world, the 
oblation made of the plainer and weaker and 
more thankless daughter to the cloistered life, 
the glory of God, and the muster in the house of 
means for no more than one nuptial outfit. All 
of which, glimmering before him in what was 
perhaps, if we may choose, his quite most 
quickened perception, would have married ill 
with the special intensity of his recognition and 
qualification had the girl not, by some light and 
exquisite influence, pleaded against the idea that 
she concurred in the law of her effacement. She 
was as sober-hued as any nun, and might well, 
so far as the material side of her presence went, 
have been trained to fasts and vigils; but wasn't 
she rather distinguishably aware of more things 
in all the world than they, and of different ones 
from theirs, upon his honour? so that her 
longish, narrowish, almost colourless face (with 
the forehead, markedly high and clear, such as 
to recall a like feature of some mothering Virgin 
by Van Eyck or Memling who dimly haunted 
him, though he couldn't possibly have met her 
in New York) showed a sort of concentration of 
consciousness, a strain and degree of expression, 
which were all that could be referred to as in any 
way tricking it out. 

He had been spending a long time, as it seemed 




  

to him, with persons positively to the number 
of three who were indicated to him now as 
having known, or at least as having been in 
structed by society, that they were pretty well 
clever enough for anything they might supposably 
be concerned with; whereas the light that hung 
during these moments about sweet Nan, since 
sweet Nan she at last, and not quite other than 
disconcertingly, was, appeared rather that of an 
intelligence rather at sea, or guessing free ap 
plication to have been so perversely denied it 
that exactly this mild comfort was what it might 
have hovered and wavered there to appeal for. 
They hadn't denied her understanding and Sir 
Cantopher had in the most pointed manner ex 
pressed her possession of it, but if there might 
have been a sense in Ralph's private greeting to 
her imaginable energies, it could scarce have 
helped involving the certitude that the family 
friend at any rate had read her most wrongly 
when he had quite most wished to distinguish 
her. She had suffered from what was wrong, 
though indeed without being at all pointedly 
aware of what was right and this even if it broke 
upon him as formidable that he should perhaps 
figure to her as a source of initiation. There 
were things in her world of imagination, it had 
taken him so few instants to surmise, which 
might verily have matched with some of those, 
the shyer, the stranger, the as yet least embodied, 





  

that confusedly peopled his own though, again, 
how any such verification of identities, felicities, 
sublimities, or whatever they might be, could 
make her "modern" without by the same stroke 
making him so, he naturally as yet failed of at 
tention to discern. He hadn't, that he knew of, 
missed from the others any note of their direct 
command either of their future or of his own; 
he had only measured some disparities between 
his and their connection with the past, the effect 
of his sense of which was that they had the ad 
vantage of their perch upon accumulations and 
continuities more substantially and above all 
more locally determined. This placed them so 
little less in the forefront of time that he should 
by rights at least have appeared to himself com 
paratively backward in the race whereby what 
would there have been in him to make in any 
special degree for fellowship with this young 
woman's originality ? Never, let us hasten to 
add, could originality, or any other inspired, in 
dependent strain, have more renounced the bene 
fit of a superficial show. The others, as he had 
seen, weren't proof against bewilderment which, 
if she was so different she ought to have been; 
but the first thing he now next asked himself 
was how he could ever let what would come of 
this precipitated meeting be what it would 
press upon her to the least confusion of her at 
best so troubled fineness. "Modern" was she? 





  

all the more reason then why he should be at 
once as explanatory as he could. Certain pas 
sages of his recent past were affecting him by 
this time as almost superlatively "ancient, and 
wasn't there one of them that it would at once 
concern him, in common kindness, let alone 
common honesty, to make known to her ? 

"I wasn't aware of your existence," he at all 
events said to her on taking to himself this per 
ception; "I mean I had never heard of you when 
I sailed any more, naturally enough, than when 
I arrived. It has only been to-day. It came out 
unexpectedly. But now I'm sure," he went on 
to the relief of his conscience, of his reason, of 
his imagination, of he could scarce have said 
what; to the rectification in any case of some 
thing he now knew, the confession made, to have 
been hurting him like some limb kept in a posture 
adverse to its function. The gained ease was 
even too great for joking he couldn't too plainly 
state it. "You see I knew all about them or I 
felt as if I had done so as soon as I got here; which 
comes to the same thing, doesn't it ? " There he 
was asking her that, by the way; as if she could 
tell him whether or no it came to the same thing. 
Would he have put such a question to her mother, 
to her sister, to her brother, or even to wondrous 
Sir Cantopher ? It was the kind of question that 
tended to produce in them that arrest of inter 
course; and, extraordinarily enough, it seemed 





  

now to hang but by a hair that it might under 
this new relation make everything easier. Was 
she going, sweet Nan, to be drawn to him just 
exactly by certain features of the play of freedom 
that he had felt warn the others off? Strange 
certainly that such a satisfaction should within 
so few moments have begun to breathe upon 
him since as a satisfaction, and quite of the 
freshest, he should know it, that was beyond mis 
take; and there was nothing to light the anomaly 
to any degree in his impression that he should 
be able to make her conceive him better simply 
by treating her, that is by simply looking at her 
even, as if she naturally would. This act would 
be on his part a more conceiving, if withal a more 
wondering, thing than any yet though what 
had, for that matter, ever been so strange as that 
the shyest, vaguest, least directly protesting pair 
of eyes ever raised to him should at the same 
time oubmit to search after a fashion that was 
in itself a sort of engagement ? "Don't you think 
you can persuade your brother to accept an ac 
commodation ?" he finally asked. 

She hadn't replied to his inquiry about its 
coming or not to the same thing as a proved case 
that he should have entertained the fancy of 
assurances she had but left the appeal in the 
air. This, however, hadn't in the least stamped 
her to his vision as stupid; he had only felt at 
once how many still other things he could put to 





  

her. Here was one as to which he should really 
like her weight thrown if she would let it be and 
since Perry had named his occasion; as to which 
too the idea of the explanatory grew in attrac 
tion instant. Clearly she didn't yet understand, 
none the less, too many things at once awaiting 
her, and the accommodation to Perry, let alone 
to herself, not having had time to profit by what 
had at first been said. Here was something of 
a tangle, but she cut the knot, after another mo 
ment, by the light force of her own readiest pres 
sure. "Do you like my mother and my sister 
now that you've seen them ?" 

Ralph stared, for beautifully important as this 
point had been she suddenly made it more so. 
"Why, cousin, I'm here as Molly's true lover 
to marry her, you know, as soon as ever the 
banns can be published and her wedding-gown 
bought: so that what sort of a figure should I 
cut if she wasn't as dear to me as life ? She is 
greater even than I dreamed." 

' 'Greater' ?" She hung again on this 

term as she had done before; but it was as if 
something had happened since then, and she 
now met his idea in time. "Won't it be that 
you'll make her great ? " 

"I hope with all my heart I shall make her 
happy, but she's splendid," Ralph gravely, al 
most sententiously, said, "beyond any power of 
mine to show her off." He clung to his gravity, 
which somehow steadied him so odd it was 
that the sense of her understanding wouldn't be 
abated, which even a particular lapse, he could 
see . 


THE Ambassador does of course think him a 
curious and interesting case of dementia, feels a 
kind of superior responsibility about him accord 
ingly, is really in a manner "fascinated" and 
mystified too; and in short quite naturally and 
inevitably stretches a point to see him, as it were, 
safely home. This he has it on his mind and his 
nerves, on his sense of responsibility, effectively 
to do. But, as naturally, he mustn't acknowledge 
his conviction, even though Ralph invites him 
to; and I get I think what I want by making 
him come down to the street in the cab as from 
curiosity to test his visitor's extraordinary state 
ment, and then plausibly propose or insist on 
getting in with him and tracking him, as it were, 
to his lair: so as to be able to have first-hand 
evidence of his material situation in the event 
of whatever further occupation. It's in the 
street and at the cab door that he makes the 
point of "seeing home," as if then and there 
merely extemporised; and with the advantage 
that I thus seem to get what I remember orig 
inally groping for, having groped for, when I 
broke this off just here so many years ago. I 
gave up taking time to excogitate my missing 
link, my jump or transition from this last ap 
pearance of my young man's in the modern world, 
so to speak, and his coming up again, where we 
next find him, after the dive, in the "old." I 
think I now have quite sufficiently got that transi 
tion I have it perfectly before me. It passes 
between them; Ralph himself, on their way, in 
the cab, or probably better still, outside, on the 
pavement in Mansfield Square and before the 
house, expresses all I want; puts it, that is, to 
his - benevolent friend, that he knows now per 
fectly that on opening the door of the house with 
his latchkey he lets himself into the Past. He 
disappears into the Past, and what he has wanted 
is that his companion shall know he is there; 
shall be able to give that account of him if he is 
missed or wanted; shall also perhaps be able to 
take in all, whatever it is to be, that may yet 
happen, and believe in his experience if he ever 
rises to the surface again with it. This of course 
but clinches the Ambassador's sense of the re 
fined beauty of his mania; though at the same 
time the very law of my procedure here is to
