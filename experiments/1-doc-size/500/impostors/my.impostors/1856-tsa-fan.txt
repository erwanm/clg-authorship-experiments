it was so much of everybody’s business that everybody let it alone. I
followed the example for awhile, but it seemed as much my duty to act as
that of any other person; and though it is little I have done, I
think that, in that little, I have filled the place designed for me by
Providence.”

“Well, really, Mrs. Walters, you were one of the last persons I should
have imagined to be nicely balancing a point of duty, or searching out
the place designed for them by Providence. I must confess myself at
fault in my judgment of character for once.”

“Indeed, madam,” replied Mrs. Walters, “I have no doubt you judged me
very correctly at the time you knew me. My first ideas of the duties and
responsibilities of life were aroused by Margaret Winne; and I recollect
that my intimacy with her commenced after you left the country.”

“Margaret Winne? Who was she? Not the wife of that little Dr. Winne we
used to hear of occasionally? They attended the same church with us, I
believe?”

“Yes; she was the one. We grew up together, and were familiar with each
other’s faces from childhood; but this was about all. She was always in
humble circumstances, as I had myself been in early life; and, after my
marriage, I used positively to dislike her, and to dread meeting her,
for she was the only one of my former acquaintances who met me on the
same terms as she had always done. I thought she wished to remind me
that we were once equals in station; but I learned, when I came to know
her well, how far she was above so mean a thought. I hardly know how
I came first to appreciate her, but we were occasionally thrown in
contact, and her sentiments were so beautiful--so much above the common
stamp--that I could not fail to be attracted by her. She was a noble
woman. The world knows few like her. So modest and retiring--with an
earnest desire to do all the good in the world of which she was capable,
but with no ambition to shine. Well fitted as she was, to be an ornament
in any station of society, she seemed perfectly content to be the idol
of her own family, and known to few besides. There were few subjects on
which she had not thought, and her clear perceptions went at once to the
bottom of a subject, so that she solved simply many a question on which
astute philosophers had found themselves at fault. I came at last to
regard her opinion almost as an oracle. I have often thought, since her
death, that it was her object to turn my life into that channel to which
it has since been devoted, but I do not know. I had never thought of the
work that has since occupied me at the time of her death, but I can see
now how cautiously and gradually she led me among the poor, and taught
me to sympathize with their sufferings, and gave me, little by little,
a clue to the evils that had sprung up in the management of our public
charities. She was called from her family in the prime of life, but they
who come after her do assuredly rise up and call her blessed. She has
left a fine family, who will not soon forget, the instructions of their
mother.”

“Ah! yes, there it is, Mrs. Walters. A woman’s sphere, after all, is at
home. One may do a great deal of good in public, no doubt, as you have
done; but don’t you think that, while you have devoted yourself so
untiringly to other affairs, you have been obliged to neglect your own
family in order to gain time for this? One cannot live two lives at
once, you know.”

“No, madam, certainly we cannot live two lives at once, but we can glean
a much larger harvest from the one which is, bestowed upon us than we
are accustomed to think. I do not, by any means, think that I have ever
neglected my own family in the performance of other duties, and I trust
my children are proving, by their hearty co-operation with me, that I am
not mistaken. Our first duty, certainly is at home, and I determined,
at the outset, that nothing should call me from the performance of this
first charge. I do not think anything can excuse a mother from devoting
a large portion of her life in personal attention to the children God
has given her. But I can assure you that, to those things which I have
done of which the world could take cognisance, I have given far less
time than I used once to devote to dress and amusement, I found, by
systematizing everything, that my time was more than doubled; and,
certainly, I was far better fitted to attend properly to my own family,
when my eyes, were opened to the responsibilities of life, than when my
thoughts were wholly occupied by fashion and display.”




ANTIDOTE FOR MELANCHOLY.



“AH, friend K----, good-morning to you; I’m really happy to see you
looking so cheerful. Pray, to what unusual circumstance may we be
indebted for this happy, smiling face of yours, this morning?” (Our
friend K----had been, unfortunately, of a very desponding and somewhat
of a choleric turn of mind, previously.)

“Really, is the change so perceptible, then? Well, my dear sir, you
shall have the secret; for, happy as I appear--and be assured, my
appearances are by no means deceptive, for I never felt more happy in my
life--it will still give me pleasure to inform you, and won’t take long,
either. It is simply this; I have made a whole family happy!”

“Indeed! Why, you have discovered a truly valuable: recipe for blues,
then, which may be used ad libitum, eh, K----?”

“You may well say that. But, really, my friend, I feel no little
mortification at not making so simple and valuable a discovery at an
earlier period of my life, Heaven knows,” continued K----, “I have
looked for contentment everywhere else. First, I sought for wealthy in
the gold mines of California, thinking that was the true source of
all earthly joys; but after obtaining it, I found myself with such a
multiplicity of cares and anxieties, that I was really more unhappy than
ever. I then sought for pleasure in travelling. This answered somewhat
the purpose of dissipating cares, &c., so long as it lasted; but, dear
me, it gave no permanent satisfaction. After seeing the whole world, I
was as badly off as Alexander the Great. He cried for another world to
conquer, and I cried for another world to see.”

The case of our friend, I imagine, differs not materially from that of
a host of other seekers of contentment in this productive world. Like
“blind leaders of the blind,” our invariable fate is to go astray in the
universal race for happiness. How common is it, after seeking for it
in every place but the right one, for the selfish man to lay the whole
blame upon this fine world--as if anybody was to blame but himself. Even
some professors of religion are too apt to libel the world. “Well, this
is a troublesome world, to make the best of it,” is not an uncommon
expression; neither is it a truthful one. “Troubles, disappointments,
losses, crosses, sickness, and death, make up the sum and substance of
our existence here,” add they, with tremendous emphasis, as if they had
no hand in producing the sad catalogue. The trouble is, we set too
high a value on our own merits; we imagine ourselves deserving of great
favours and privileges, while we are doing nothing to merit them. In
this respect, we are not altogether unlike the young man in the parable,
who, by-the-by, was also a professor--he professed very loudly of having
done all those good things “from his youth up.” But when the command
came, “go sell all thou hast, and give to the poor,” &c., it soon took
the conceit out of him.

In this connexion, there are two or three seemingly important
considerations, which I feel some delicacy in touching upon here.
However, in the kindest possible spirit, I would merely remark, that
there is a very large amount of wealth in the Church--by this I include
its wealthy members, of course; and refer to no particular denomination;
by Church, I mean all Christian denominations. Now, in connexion with
this fact, such a question as this arises in my mind--and I put it, not,
for the purpose of fault-finding, for I don’t know that I have a right
view of the matter, but merely for the consideration of those who are
fond of hoarding up their earthly gains, viz.: Suppose the modern Church
was composed of such professors as the self-denying disciples of our
Saviour,--with their piety, simplicity, and this wealth; what, think
you, would be the consequence? Now I do not intend to throw out any
such flings as, “comparisons are odious”--“this is the modern Christian
age”--“the age of Christian privileges,” and all that sort of nonsense.
Still, I am rather inclined to the opinion, that if we were all--in
and out of the Church--disposed to live up to, or carry out what we
professedly know to be right, it would be almost as difficult to find
real trouble, as it is now to find real happiness.

The sources of contentment and discontentment are discoverable,
therefore, without going into a metaphysical examination of the subject.
Just in proportion as we happen to discharge, or neglect known duties,
are we, according to my view, happy or miserable on earth. Philosophy
tells us that our happiness and well-being depends upon a conformity to
certain unalterable laws--moral, physical, and organic--which act upon
the intellectual, moral, and material universe, of which man is a part,
and which determine, or regulate the growth, happiness, and well-being
of all organic beings. These views, when reduced to their simple
meaning, amount to the same thing, call it by what name we will. Duties,
of course, imply legal or moral obligations, which we are certainly
legally or morally bound to pay, perform, or discharge. And certain it
is, there is no getting over them--they are as irresistible as
Divine power, as universal as Divine presence, as permanent as Divine
existence, and no art nor cunning of man can disconnect unhappiness from
transgressing them. How necessary to our happiness, then, is it, not
only to know, but to perform our whole duty?

One of the great duties of man in this life, and, perhaps, the most
neglected, is that of doing good, or benefiting one another. That doing
good is clearly a duty devolving upon man, there can be no question. The
benevolent Creator, in placing man in the world, endowed him with mental
and physical energies, which clearly denote that he is to be active in
his day and generation.

Active in what? Certainly not in mischief, for that would not be
consistent with Divine goodness. Neither should we suppose that we are
here for our own sakes simply. Such an idea would be presumptuous. For
what purpose, then, was man endowed with all these facilities of mind
and body, but to do good and glorify his Maker? True philosophy teaches
that benevolence was not only the design of the Creator in all His
works, but the fruits to be expected from them. The whole infinite
contrivances of everything above, around, and within us, are directed
to certain benevolent issues, and all the laws of nature are in perfect
harmony with this idea.

That such is the design of man may also be inferred from the happiness
which attends every good action, and the misery of discontentment which
attends those who not only do wrong, but are useless to themselves and
to society. Friend K----‘s case, above quoted, is a fair illustration of
this truth.

Now, then, if it is our duty to do all the good we can, and I think this
will be admitted, particularly by the Christian, and this be measured
by our means and opportunity, then there are many whom Providence has
blessed with the means and opportunity of doing a very great amount of
good. And if it be true, as it manifestly is, that “it is more blessed
to give than receive,” then has Providence also blessed them with very
great privileges. The privilege of giving liberally, and thus obtaining
for themselves the greater blessing, which is the result of every
benevolent action, the simple satisfaction with ourselves which follows
a good act, or consciousness of having done our duty in relieving
a fellow-creature, are blessings indeed, which none but the good or
benevolent can realize. Such kind spirits are never cast down. Their
hearts always light and cheerful--rendered so by their many kind
offices,--they can always enjoy their neighbours, rich or poor, high or
low, and love them too; and with a flow of spirits which bespeak a heart
all right within, they make all glad and happy around them.

Doing good is an infallible antidote for melancholy. When the heart
seems heavy, and our minds can light upon nothing but little naughty
perplexities, everything going wrong, no bright spot or relief anywhere
for our crazy thoughts, and we are finally wound up in a web of
melancholy, depend upon it there is nothing, nothing which can dispel
this angry, ponderous, and unnatural cloud from our rheumatic minds
and consciences like a charity visit--to give liberally to those in
need of succour, the poor widow, the suffering, sick, and poor, the
aged invalid, the lame, the blind, &c., &c.; all have a claim upon your
bounty, and how they will bless you and love you for it--anyhow, they
will thank kind Providence for your mission of love. He that makes one
such visit will make another and another; he can’t very well get weary
in such well-doing, for his is the greater blessing. It is a blessing
indeed: how the heart is lightened, the soul enlarged, the mind
improved, and even health; for the mind being liberated from
perplexities, the body is at rest, the nerves in repose, and the blood,
equalized, courses freely through the system, giving strength, vigour,
and equilibrium to the whole complicated machinery. Thus we can think
clearer, love better, enjoy life, and be thankful for it.

What a beautiful arrangement it is that we can, by doing good to others,
do so much good to ourselves! The wealthy classes, who “rise above
society like clouds above the earth, to diffuse an abundant dew,” should
not forget this fact. The season has now about arrived, when the good
people of all classes will be most busily engaged in these delightful
duties. The experiment is certainly worth trying by all. If all
those desponding individuals, whose chief comfort is to growl at this
“troublesome world,” will but take the hint, look trouble full in the
face, and relieve it, they will, like friend K----, feel much better.

It may be set down as a generally correct axiom, (with some few
exceptions, perhaps, such as accidents, and the deceptions and cruelties
of those whom we injudiciously select for friends and confidants, from
our want of discernment), that life is much what we make it, and so is
the world.




THE SORROWS OF A WEALTHY CITIZEN.



AH me! Am I really a rich man, or am I not? That is the question. I
am sure I don’t feel rich; and yet, here I am written down among the
“wealthy citizens” as being worth seventy thousand dollars! How the
estimate was made, or who furnished the data, is all a mystery to me. I
am sure I wasn’t aware of the fact before. “Seventy thousand dollars!”
 That sounds comfortable, doesn’t it? Seventy thousand dollars!--But
where is it? Ah! There is the rub! How true it is that people always
know more about you than you do yourself.

Before this unfortunate book came out (“The Wealthy Citizens of
Philadelphia”), I was jogging on very quietly. Nobody seemed to be aware
of the fact that I was a rich man, and I had no suspicion of the thing
myself. But, strange to tell, I awoke one morning and found myself worth
seventy thousand dollars! I shall never forget that day. Men who had
passed me in the street with a quiet, familiar nod, now bowed with a low
salaam, or lifted their hats deferentially, as I encountered them on the
pave.

“What’s the meaning of all this?” thought I. “I haven’t stood up to
be shot at, nor sinned against innocence and virtue. I haven’t been to
Paris. I don’t wear moustaches. What has given me this importance?”

And, musing thus, I pursued my way in quest of money to help me out
with some pretty heavy payments. After succeeding, though with some
difficulty in obtaining what I wanted, I returned to my store about
twelve o’clock. I found a mercantile acquaintance awaiting me, who,
without many preliminaries, thus stated his business:

“I want,” said he, with great coolness, “to get a loan of six or seven
thousand dollars; and I don’t know of any one to whom I can apply with
more freedom and hope of success than yourself. I think I can satisfy
you, fully, in regard to security.

“My dear sir,” replied I, “if you only wanted six or seven hundred
dollars, instead of six or seven thousand dollars, I could not
accommodate you. I have just come in from a borrowing expedition
myself.”

I was struck with the sudden change in the man’s countenance. He was not
only disappointed, but offended. He did not believe my statement. In
his eyes, I had merely resorted to a subterfuge, or, rather, told a
lie, because I did not wish to let him have my money. Bowing with cold
formality, he turned away and left my place of business. His manner to
me has been reserved ever since.

On the afternoon of that day, I was sitting in the back part of my store
musing on some, matter of business, when I saw a couple of ladies enter.
They spoke to one of my clerks, and he directed them back to where I was
taking things comfortably in an old arm-chair.

“Mr. G----, I believe?” said the elder of the two ladies, with a bland
smile.

I had already arisen, and to this question, or rather affirmation, I
bowed assent.

“Mr. G----,” resumed the lady, producing a small book as she spoke, “we
are a committee, appointed to make collections in this district for
the purpose of setting up a fair in aid of the funds of the Esquimaux
Missionary Society. It is the design of the ladies who have taken this
matter in hand to have a very large collection of articles, as the funds
of the society are entirely exhausted. To the gentlemen of our district,
and especially to those who leave been liberally blessed with this
world’s goods”--this was particularly emphasized--“we look for
important aid. Upon you, sir, we have called first, in order that you
may head the subscription, and thus set an example of liberality to
others.”

And the lady handed me the book in the most “of course” manner in the
world, and with the evident expectation that I would put down at least
fifty-dollars.

Of course I was cornered, and must do something, I tried to be bland
and polite; but am inclined to think that I failed in the effort. As for
fairs, I never did approve of them. But that was nothing. The enemy had
boarded me so suddenly and so completely, that nothing, was left for
me but to surrender at discretion, and I did so with as good grace as
possible. Opening my desk, I took out a five dollar bill and presented
it; to the elder of the two ladies, thinking that I was doing very well
indeed. She took the money, but was evidently disappointed; and did not
even ask me to head the list with my name.

“How money does harden the heart!” I overheard one of my fair
visiters say to the other, in a low voices but plainly intended for my
edification, as they walked off with their five dollar bill.

“Confound your impudence!” I said to myself, thus taking my revenge out
of them. “Do you think I’ve got nothing else to do with my money but
scatter it to the four winds?”

And I stuck my thumbs firmly in the armholes of my waistcoat, and took a
dozen turns up and down my store, in order to cool off.

“Confound your impudence!” I then repeated, and quietly sat down again
in the old arm-chair.

On the next day I had any number of calls from money-hunters. Business
men, who had never thought of asking me for loans, finding that I
was worth seventy thousand dollars, crowded in upon me for temporary
favours, and, when disappointed in their expectations, couldn’t seem to
understand it. When I spoke of being “hard up” myself, they looked as if
they didn’t clearly comprehend what I meant.

A few days after the story of my wealth had gone abroad, I was sitting,
one evening, with my family, when I was informed that a lady was in the
parlour, and wished to see me.

“A lady!” said I.

“Yes, sir,” replied the servant.

“Is she alone?”

“Yes, sir.”

“What does she want?”

“She did not say, sir.”

“Very well. Tell her I’ll be down in a few moments.”

When I entered the parlour, I found a woman, dressed in mourning, with
her veil closely drawn.

“Mr. G----?” she said, in a low, sad voice.

I bowed, and took a place upon the sofa where she was sitting, and from
which she had not risen upon my entrance.

“Pardon the great liberty I have taken,” she began, after a pause of
embarrassment, and in an unsteady voice. “But, I believe I have not
mistaken your character for sympathy and benevolence, nor erred in
believing that your hand is ever ready to respond to the generous
impulses of our heart.”

I bowed again, and my visiter went on.

“My object in calling upon you I will briefly state. A year ago my
husband died. Up to that time I had never known the want of anything
that money could buy. He was a merchant of this city, and supposed to
be in good circumstances. But he left an insolvent estate; and now, with
five little ones to care for, educate, and support, I have parted with
nearly my last dollar, and have not a single friend to whom I can look
for aid.”

There was a deep earnestness and moving pathos in the tones of the
woman’s voice, that went to my heart. She paused for a few moments,
overcome with her feelings, and then resumed:--

“One in an extremity like mine, sir, will do many things from which,
under other circumstances she should shrink. This is my only excuse for
troubling you at the present time. But I cannot see my little family in
want without an effort to sustain them; and, with a little aid, I see
my way clear to do so. I was well educated, and feel not only competent,
but willing to undertake a school. There is one, the teacher of which
being in bad health, wishes to give it up, and if I can get the means to
buy out her establishment, will secure an ample and permanent income for
my family. To aid me, sir, in doing this, I now make an appeal to you. I
know you are able, and I believe you are willing to put forth your hand
and save my children from want, and, it may be, separation.”

The woman still remained closely veiled; I could not, therefore, see her
face. But I could perceive that she was waiting with trembling suspense
for my answer. Heaven knows my heart responded freely to her appeal.

“How much will it take to purchase this establishment?” I inquired.

“Only a thousand dollars,” she replied.

I was silent. A thousand dollars!

“I do not wish it, sir, as a gift,” she said “only as a loan. In a year
or two I will be able to repay it.”

“My dear madam,” was my reply, “had I the ability most gladly would I
meet your wishes. But, I assure you I have not. A thousand dollars taken
from my business would destroy it.”

A deep sigh, that was almost a groan, came up from the breast of the
stranger, and her head dropped low upon her bosom. She seemed to have
fully expected the relief for which she applied; and to be stricken to
the earth by my words! We were both unhappy.

“May I presume to ask your name, madam?” said I, after a pause.

“It would do no good to mention it,” she replied, mournfully. “It
has cost me a painful effort to come to you; and now that my hope has
proved, alas! in vain, I must beg the privilege of still remaining a
stranger.”

She arose, as she said this. Her figure was tall and dignified. Dropping
me a slight courtesy, she was turning to go away, when I said,

“But, madam, even if I have not the ability to grant your request, I may
still have it in my power to aid you in this matter. I am ready to do
all I can; and, without doubt, among the friends of your husband will be
found numbers to step forward and join in affording you the assistance
so much desired, when they are made aware of your present extremity.”

The lady made an impatient gesture, as if my words were felt as a
mockery or an insult, and turning from me, again walked from the room
with a firm step. Before I could recover myself, she had passed into the
street, and I was left standing alone. To this day I have remained in
ignorance of her identity. Cheerfully would I have aided her to the
extent of my ability to do so. Her story touched my feelings and
awakened my liveliest sympathies, and if, on learning her name and
making proper inquiries into her circumstances, I had found all to be
as she had stated, I would have felt it a duty to interest myself in her
behalf, and have contributed in aid of the desired end to the extent of
my ability. But she came to me under the false idea that I had but to
put my hand in my pocket, or write a check upon the bank, and lo! a
thousand dollars were forthcoming. And because I did not do this,
she believed me unfeeling, selfish, and turned from me mortified,
disappointed, and despairing.

I felt sad for weeks after this painful interview. On the very next
morning I received a letter from an artist, in which he spoke of the
extremity of his circumstances, and begged me to purchase a couple of
pictures. I called at his rooms, for I could not resist his appeal. The
pictures did not strike me as possessing much artistic value.

“What do you ask for them?” I inquired.

“I refused a hundred dollars for the pair. But I am compelled to part
with them now, and you shall have them for eighty.”

I had many other uses for eighty dollars, and therefore shook my head.
But, as he looked disappointed, I offered to take one of the pictures at
forty dollars. To this he agreed. I paid the money, and the picture was
sent home. Some days afterward, I was showing it to a friend.

“What did you pay for it?” he asked.

“Forty dollars,” I replied.

The friend smiled strangely.

“What’s the matter?” said I.

“He offered it to me for twenty-five.”

“That picture?”

“Yes.”

“He asked me eighty for this and another, and said he had refused a
hundred for the pair.”
