She's just my height and weight. Of course I must tell 
the girls the truth — that I'm economizing; but wild 
horses wouldn't drag it out of them. I don't care tup- 
pence, but Morty says it would hurt his business. I 
rather like the idea of working. I'm tired of the old 
round, and would like to get a job if Morty wasn't so 
opposed — says it would ruin him." 

"I should think so. At least let us wash our dirty 
linen at home. ... I have been thinking while you 



 

talked. I 've only spent two whole winters in town since 
I married, and I've always thought I'd love to live in 
the old house. I've rather envied you, Alexina, dear 
... it is so full of happy memories for me. I did have 
such a good time as a girl . . . such a good, simple time. 
... I'm wondering if Tom wouldn't rent it for the 
winter and spring. He's been doing splendidly these 
last two or three years, and he owned some of the property west of Twin Peaks that is building up so fast. I 
know he sold it for quite a lot. . . . And I sometimes 
wonder if he doesn't get as tired of living in the same 
place year after year as I do. He could play golf at the 
Ingleside. ... I am sure he will. ... It would be the 
very best thing all round. Then we could run the house, 
and you and Mortimer would pay something — never 
mind what. . . . People would think it was the other 
way, if they thought anything about it. Families often 
double up in that fashion." 

"Maria! I can't believe it. It would be too perfect 
a solution, provided of course that we pay all we cost. 
I should insist upon keeping the slips as usual. You 
are an angel." 

"We Groomes and Ballingers always stand by one 
another, don't we? The Abbotts, too. Besides, it will 
certainly be no sacrifice on any of our parts. It will 
mean a great deal to me to spend six months in town, 
and I know that Tom has grown as tired of motoring 
back and forth every day as he used to be of the train." 

' ' It will be heavenly just having you. ' ' Alexina spoke 
with perfect sincerity. She had not faltered before the 
prospect of work, but that of Mortimer's society unrelieved for an indefinite time had filled her with something like panic. It had been the one test of her powers 
of endurance of which she had not felt assured. 

"That will give us time, too, to get on our feet agaia. 
Morty is very hopeful of this new business. I shall go 
out very little, and as Joan will be the natured center 
of attraction it will be understood that her friends, not 
mine, have the run of the house." 

Maria nodded. "It's just the thing for Joan. Really 
a godsend. She worries me more than all three of the 



 

boys. They are east at school for the winter and of 
course don't come home for the Christmas holidays. If 
you want to be housekeeper you may. I don't know anything I should like better than a rest from ordering 
dinner, after all these years." 

"Perfect ! I'll also take care of my room and Morty's. 
Then I'd be sure I wasn't really imposing on you. 
You 're a dead game sport, Maria, and I 'd like to drink 
your health. ' ' 



CHAPTER XV 



MORTIMER looked nonplussed when Alexina informed him at dinner of the immediate solution 
of their difficulties. He detested Tom and Maria Abbott; there were certain things he could forget in his 
aristocratic wife's presence, far as she had withdrawn, 
but never in theirs. Moreover he feared Abbott. He 
was as keen as a hawk; an unconsidered word and he 
might as well have told the whole story. "Well, he never 
talked much anyhow ; he would merely talk less. 

When Alexina asked him if he had any better plan to 
propose he was forced to shrug his shoulders and set his 
lips in a straight line of resignation. When she told 
him what her original plan had been he was so appalled, so humiliated at the bare thought of his wife 
in a servant's apron (to say nothing of the culinary arrangements) that he almost warmed to the Abbotts. 



Ten days later, on the eve of the Abbotts' arrival, the 
equanimity of spirit he was striving to regain by the 
simple process of thinking of something else when his 
late delinquencies obtruded themselves, received a severe 
shock. Alexina handed him a cheque for ten thousand 
dollars and asked him to place it to Gora's account in 
the bank where she kept her savings. 



 

"Where did you get it?" he asked stupidly, staring at 
the slip of paper so heavily freighted. 

"Anne Montgomery sold some of my things to a good- 
natured ignoramus whose husband made a fortune ia 
Tonopah. She doesn't know how to buy and Anne ad- 
vises her." 

' ' What did you seU ? Your jewels ? ' ' 

"Some. I never wear anything but the pearls anyhow; and it's bad taste to wear jewels unless you're 
wealthy. I had some old lace that is hard to buy now, 
and real lace isn't the fashion any more. New rich people always think it's just the thing. I also sold her two 
of the biggest and clumsiest of the Italian pieces. She 
is crazy about them. Anne told her that they were as 
good as a passport." 

Mortimer sprang to the only, the naive, the eternal 
masculine conclusion. 

"You do love me still!" The dull eyes of his spirit 
flashed with the sudden rejuvenation of his heavy body. 
"I never really believed you had ceased to care . . . 
you were capricious like all women ... a little spoilt. 
I knew that if I had patience . . . Only a loving wife 
)!f ould do such a thing. ' ' 

Alexina made a wry face at the banality of his climax, 
although the fatuous outburst had barely amused her. 

"No, I don't love you in the least, Mortimer, and never 
shall. Make up your mind to that. Love some one else 
if you like. ... I did this for two reasons: I did not 
have the courage to tell Gora the truth — and that I was 
too unjust and penurious to restore the money you had 
taken ; and as your wife it would have hurt my pride unbearably. ' ' 

"And you are not afraid to trust me with this money?" he asked, his voice toneless. 

"Not in the least. There's no other way to manage it 
and I fancy you know what would happen if you didn't 
hand it over. There is such a thing as the last straw. ' ' 



 



CHAPTER XV 



T T was a week later. Alexina was changing her dress. 
Maria had asked a number of her girlhood friends in 
for luncheon, and they were to exchange reminiscences 
in the old house over a table laden as of yore with the 
massive Ballinger silver, English eutglass, and French 
china. Alexina was about to take refuge with Janet 
Maynard. 

Her door opened unceremoniously and Gora entered. 

Alexina caught her breath as she saw her sister-ia- 
law's eyes. They looked like polar seas in a tropical 
Btorm. 

' ' Why, Gora, dear, ' ' she said lightly. ' ' I thought you 
were on an important case." 

' ' Man died last night. I have just been to see Mortimer. "When I got his note — just three lines — saying that 
he had received a cheque from Utica and deposited it to 
my account I knew at once — as soon as I had time to 
think — there was something wrong. The natural thing 
would have been to call me up — couldn't tell me the 
good news too soon. . . . And there was a hollow ring 
about that note. . . . Well, as soon as I woke up to-day 
I went straight down to his office. I had to wait an 
hour. When he came in and saw me he turned green. 
I marched him into a back room and corkscrewed the 
truth out of him — the whole truth. Then I blasted him. 
He knows exactly what one person in this world thinks 
of him, what everybody else would think of him if he 
were found out. I gathered that you had let him down 
easy. Your toploftieal pride, I suppose. Well, I must 
have a good plebeian streak in me somewhere and for 
the first time I was glad of it. When I left him he looked 
shrunken to half his natural size. His eyes looked like 
a dead fish's and all the muscles of his face had given 
way. He looked as if he were going to die and I wish 



 

he would. Faugh! A thief in the family. That at 
least we never had before. " 

"Don't be too sure. Remember nobody else knows 
about Morty, and everybody 'll go on thinking he's honest. Half our friends may be thieves for all we know, 
and as for our ancestors — what are you doing?" 



Gora had taken a roU of yellow bills from her purse. 
She counted them on the table; ten bills denominating a 
thousand dollars each. 

"I won't take them," said Alexina stiffy. "I think 
you are horrid, simply horrid." 

"And do you imagine I would keep it? "What do you 
take me for?" 

"I am in a way responsible for Mortimer's debts — his 
partner. ' ' 

' ' That cuts no ice with me — nor with you. That is not 
the reason you sold your jewels and laces and those 

superb Oh, you poor child! If I'm furious, it's 

more for you than on any other account. You don't deserve such a fate " 

"I don't deserve to have you treat me so ungratefully. I can't get my things back. I wanted you to 
have the money more than I cared for those things, anyhow. I have no use for the money. I don't owe anything and the rent Tom pays me for six months will help 
me to run the house for the rest of the year and pay 
taxes besides. So, you just keep it, Gora. It's yours 
and that's the end of it." 

"This is the end of it as far as I'm concerned." She 
opened the secret drawer of the cabinet and stuffed in 
the bills. ' ' They 're safe from any sort of burglars there. 
But not from fire. Bank them to-morrow." 

"I'll not touch them." 

"Nor I either." 


Gora threw her hat on the floor and sitting down before the table thrust her hands into her hair and tugged 



 

at the roots. "I always do this when I'm excited — 
which is oftener than you think. What dreams I had 
that first night — I got his note late and was too tired 
to reason, to suspect. ... I just dreamed until I fell 
asleep. I'd start for England a week later — for England!" 

Goose flesh made Alexina's delicate body feel like a 
cold iiutmeg grater. "England?" 

' ' Yes ! . . . ah . . . you see, it 's the only place where 
literary recognition counts for anything." 

"Oh? I rather thought the British authors looked 
upon Uncle Sam in the light of a fairy godfather. Our 
recognition counts for a good deal, I should say. I never 
thought you were snobbish." 

"I'm not really. Only London is a sort of Mecca for 
writers just as Paris is for women of fashion. . . . Just 
fancy being feted in London after you had written a successful novel." i 

"I'd far rather receive recognition in my own country," said Alexins, elevating her classic American 
profile. She was not feeling in the least patriotic, how- 
ever. "You'd see your friend Gathbroke, though. That 
would be jolly. Do take the money, Gora, and don't be 
a goose." 

' ' That subject 's closed. Don 't let me keep you. James 
told me that Maria is having a luncheon, and I suppose 
that means you are going out. I'll rest here for awhile 
if you don 't mind. ' ' 



CHAPTER XVI 



MORTIMER went off that night and got drunk. It 
was the first time in his life and possibly his last, 
but he made a thorough job of it. He took the precau- 
tion to telephone to the house that he was going out of 
town, but when he returned two days later he experienced a distinct pleasure in telling Alexina what he had 



 

done. Alexina, who still hoped that she would always 
be able to regard Life as God 's good joke, rather sympathized with him, and assured him that he would have 
nothing to apprehend from Gora in the future ; she had 
no more fervent wish than to keep out of his way. 



He found himself on the whole very comfortable. 
Maria was always most kind, Alexina polite and amiable, 
and Tom ' ' decent. ' ' Joan liked him as well as she liked 
anybody, and when the family spent a quiet evening at 
home he undertook to improve her dancing and she was 
correspondingly grateful; it had been her weak point. 
The fiction was carefully preserved that the Dwights 
were conferring a favor on the Abbotts and that all expenses were equally shared. In time he came to believe 
it, and his hours of deep depression, when he had pondered over his inexplicable roguery, grew rarer and 
finally ceased. After all he had had nothing to lose as 
far as Alexina was concerned; one's sister hardly mattered (Did women matter much, anyhow?) ; and his sense 
of security, which he hugged at this time as the most 
precious thing he had ever possessed, at last made him a 
little arrogant. He had done what he should not, of 
course, but it was over and done with, ancient history; 
and where other men had gone to State's Prison for less, 
he had been protected like an infant from a rude wind. 
He knew that he would never do it again and that his 
position in life was as assured as it ever had been. 





He spent a good many evenings at the elub, and Maria 
found him a willing cavalier when Tom "drew the line" 
at dancing parties. Alexina, who had sold her car to 
Janet and her new gowns to Polly, had announced that 
she was bored with dancing and should devote the winter 
to study. She spent the evenings either in her library 
upstairs or with her friends. Mortimer saw her only at 
the table. 



 

He wondered if Tom Abbott would rent the bouse 
every winter. A pleasant feeling of irresponsibility was 
beginning to possess bis jaded spirit. He made a little 
money occasionally, but be was no longer expected to 
band anything over when the first of the month came 
round — a date that had haunted him like a nightmare for 
four long years. He could spend it on himself, and be 
felt an increasing pleasure in doing so. 



CHAPTER XVII 



RAY naked trees; orchards of prune and peach and 
cherry, mile after mile. Orange trees in small way- 
side gardens heavy-laden with golden fruit. Tall accacias a mass of canary colored bloom. Opulent palms 
shivering against a gray sky. Close mountains green 
and dense with forest trees, their crests filagreed with 
redwoods. Far mountains lifting their bleak ridges 
above bare brown bills thirsting for rain. 

The heavy rains were due. It was late in January. 
Alexina and several of her friends were motoring back 
to the city through the Santa Clara Valley, after 
luncheon with the Price Ruylers at their home on the 
mountain above Los Gatos. As it was Sunday there was 
an even number of men in the party, and Alexina, maneuvered into Jimmie Thome's roadster, was enduring 
with none of the sweet womanly graciousness which was 
hers to summon at will, one of those passionate declarations of love which no beautiful young woman out of love 
with her husband may hope to escape; and not always 
when in. Alexina had grown skillful in eluding the 
reckless verbalisms of love, but when one is packed into 
a small motor car with a determined man, desperately in 
love, one might as weU try to wave aside the whirlwind. 

Jimmie Thorne was a fine specimen of the college-bred 
young American of good family and keen professional 
mind. He has no place in this biography save in so far 



 

as he jarred the inner forces of Alexina's being, and he 
fell at Chateau-Thierry. 



n 

Alexina lifted her delicate profile and gave it as sulky 
an expression as she could assume. She really liked him, 
but was annoyed at being trapped. 

"I don't in the least wish to marry you." 

"Everybody knows you don't care a straw for Dwight. 
You could easily get a divorce " 

"On what grounds? Besides, I don't want to. I'd 
have to be really off my 'head about a man even to thiak 
of such a thing. Our family has kept out of the divorce 
courts. And I don't care two twigs for you, Jimmie 
dear." 

"I don't believe it. That is, I know I could make 
you care. You don't know what love is " 

' ' I suppose you are about to say that you think I think 
I am cold, and that if I labor under this delusion it is 
only because the right man hasn't come along. Well, 
Jimmie dear, you would only be the sixteenth. I suppose men will keep on saying it until I am forty — forty- 
five — what is the limit these days? I know exactly what 
I am and you don't." 

"I'm not going to be put off by words. Remember 
I'm a lawyer of sorts. God ! I wish I'd been here when 
you married that codfish, instead of studying law at 
Columbia. Do you mean to tell me I couldn't have won 
you?" 

' ' No. Almost any man can win a little goose of eighteen if circumstances favor him. Twenty-five is another 
matter. Oh, but V£istly another! Even if I'd never 
married before I 'm not at all sure I should have fallen in 
love with you." 

"Yes, you would. You're frozen over, that's all." 

Alexina sighed, and not with exasperation. He was 
very charming, magnetic, companionable. He was hand- 
some and clever and manly. She could feel the warmth 
of his young virile body through their fur coats, and her 
own trembled a little. ... It suddenly came to her that 



 

she no longer owed Mortimer anything. Their "partnership" had been dissolved by his own act. If she 
could have loved Jimmie Thorne with something beyond 
the agreeable response of the mating-season (any season 
is the mating season in California) . . . that was the 
trouble. He was not individual enough to hold her. 
Life had been too kind to him. Save for this unsatisfied passion he was perfectly content with life. Such 
men do not "live." They may have charm, but not fascination. . . . Perhaps it was as well after all that she 
had married Mortimer. Another man might not have 
been so easily disposed of. 

' ' Jimmie dear, if it were a question of a few months, 
and I made a cult of men as some women do, it would be 
all right. But marry another man that I am not sure — 
that I know I don't want to spend my life with. Oh, 
no." 

He looked somewhat scandalized. Like many Ameri- 
can men he was even more conventional than most 
women are; he was, moreover, a man's man, spending 
most of his leisure in their society, either at the club or 
in out-of-door sports, and he divided women rigidly into 
two classes. Alexina was his first love and his last ; and 
as he went over the top and crumpled up he thought of 
her. 

' ' I wouldn 't have a rotten affair with you. You 're not 
made for that sort of thing " 

"Well, you're not going to have one, so don't bother 
to buckle on your armor." She relented as she looked 
into his miserable eyes, and took his hand impulsively. 
"I'm sorry . . . sorry. ... I wish . . . you are worth 
it . . . but it's not on the map." 



CHAPTER XVIII 
I 

GORA'S novel was published in February. Aileen 
 Lawton, Sibyl Bascom, Alice Thorndyke, Polly 
Roberts, and Janet Maynard organized a campaign to 



 

make it the fashion. They went about with copies under 
their arms, on the street, in the shops, at luncheons, even 
at the matinee, and "could talk of nothing else." Sibyl 
and Janet bought a dozen copies each and sent them to 
friends and acquaintances with the advice to read it at 
once unless they wished to be hopelessly out of date: 
it was "all the rage in New York."
