moving to the door. 

"Go away, go away or they 'll kill you!" 
Mme. de Brecourt went on, excitedly. " After all 


I have done for you after the way I have lied 
for yon ! " And she sobbed, trying to repress her 
sobs. 

Francie, at this, broke out into a torrent of tears. 
" I 'll go home. Father, father ! " she almost shrieked, 
reaching the door. 

" Oh, your father he has been a nice father, 
bringing you up in such ideas ! " These words 
followed her with infinite scorn, but almost as 
Mme. de Brecourt uttered them, struck by a sound, 
she sprang after the girl, seized her, drew her 
back and held her a moment, listening, before 
she could pass out. " Hush hush they are com 
ing in here, they are too anxious ! Deny deny 
it say you know nothing! Your sister must 
have said things and such things: say it all 
comes from her!" 

"Oh, you dreadful is that what you do?" 
cried Francie, shaking herself free. The door 
opened as she spoke and Mme. de Brecourt 
walked quickly to the window, turning her back. 
Mme. de Cliche was there and Mr. Probert and 
M. de Brecourt and M. de Cliche. They entered 
in silence and M. de Brecourt, coming last, closed 
the door softly behind him. Francie had never 
been in a court of justice, but if she had had that 
experience these four persons would have reminded 
her of the jury filing back into their box with their 
verdict. They all looked at her hard as she stood 
in the middle of the room ; Mme. de Brecourt gazed 







out of the window, wiping her eyes ; Mme. de 
Clich^ grasped a newspaper, crumpled and partly 
folded. Francie got a quick impression, moving 
her eyes from one face to another, that old Mr. 
Probert was the worst; his mi]d, ravaged expres 
sion was terrible. He was the one who looked at 
her least; he went to the fireplace and leaned 
on the mantel, with his head in his hands. He 
seemed ten years older. 

"Ah, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, mademoi 
selle!" said Maxime de Cliche, slowly, impressively, 
in a tone of the most respectful but most poignant 
reproach. 

" Have you seen it have they sent it to you ? " 
his wife asked, thrusting the paper towards her. 
" It s quite at your service ! " But as Francie 
neither spoke nor took it she tossed it upon the 
sofa, where, as it opened, falling, the girl read 
the name of the Reverberator. Mme. de Cliche 
carried her head very far back. 

" She has nothing to do with it it s just as 
I told you she s overwhelmed," said Mme. de 
Brecon rt, remaining at the window. 

" You would do well to read it it s worth the 
trouble," Alphonse de Brecourt remarked, going- 
over to his wife. Francie saw him kiss her as 
he perceived her tears. She was angry at her 
own ; she choked and swallowed them ; they 
seemed somehow to put her in the wrong. 

" Have you had no idea that any such mon- 


strosity would be perpetrated ? " Mme. de Cliche 
went on, coming nearer to her. She had a manner 
of forced calmness as if she wished it to be un 
derstood that she was one of those who could be 
reasonable under any provocation, though she were 
trembling within which made Francie draw back. 
" C est pourtant rempli de choses which we know 
you to have been told of by what folly, great 
heaven ! It s right and left no one is spared it s 
a deluge of insult. My sister perhaps will have 
told you of the apprehensions I had I couldn 't 
resist them, though I thought of nothing so awful 
as this, God knows, the day I met you at Mr. 
Waterlow s with your journalist." 

" I have told her everything don 't you see she s 
andantie ? Let her go, let her go ! " exclaimed 
Mme. de Brecourt, still at the window. 

" Ah, your journalist, your journalist, mademoi 
selle ! " said Maxime de Cliche, " I am very sorry 
to have to say anything in regard to any friend of 
yours that can give you so little pleasure ; but I 
promise myself the satisfaction of administering 
him with these hands a dressing he won 't forget, 
if I may trouble you so far as to ask you to Jet 
him know it ! " 

M. de Cliche fingered the points of liis 
moustache; he diffused some powerful scent ; his 
eyes were dreadful to Francie. She wished Mr. 
Probert would say something kind to her; but she 
had now determined to be strong. They were ever 







so many against one ; Gaston was far away and 
she felt heroic. " If you mean Mr. Flack I don 't 
know what you mean," she said as composedly as 
possible to M. de Cliche". " Mr. Flack has gone 
to London." 

At this M. de Brecourt gave a free laugh and 
his brother-in-law replied, " Ah, it s easy to go 
to London." 

" They like such things there ; they do them 
more and more. It s as bad as America 1 " Mme. 
de Cliche declared. 

" Why have you sent for me what do you all 
want me to do ? You might explain I am only 
an American girl ! " said Francie, whose being 
only an American girl, did not prevent her 
pretty head from holding itself now as high as 
Mme. de Cliche s. 

Mme. de Brecourt came back to her quickly, 
laying her hand on her arm. "You are very 
nervous you had much better go home. I will 
explain everything to them I will make them 
understand. The carriage is here it had orders 
to wait." 

" I'm not in the least nervous, but I have made 
you all so," Francie replied, laughing. 

" I defend you, my dear young lady I insist 
that you are only a wretched victim, like ourselves 
M. de Brecourt remarked, approaching her with 
a smile. "I see the hand of a woman in it, you 
know," he went on, to the others ; " for there are 

strokes of a vulgarity that a man doesn 't sink 
to (he can t, his very organisation prevents him) 
even if he be the greatest cad on earth. But 
please don 't doubt that I have maintained that 
that woman is not you." 

"The way you talk I don 't know how to 
write," said Francie. 

" My poor child, when one knows you as I 
do ! " murmured Mme. de Brecourt, with her arm 
around her. 

"There s a lady who helps him Mr. Flack 
has told me so," Francie continued. " She s a 
literary lady herein Paris she writes what he tells 
her. I think her name is Miss Topping, but she 
calls herself Florine or Dorine," Francie added. 

" Miss Dosson, you're too rare ! " Marguerite de 
Cliche exclaimed, giving a long moan of pain 
which ended in an incongruous laugh. "Then 
you have been three to it," she went on ; " that 
accounts for its perfection ! " 

Francie disengaged herself again from Mme. 
de Brecourt and went to Mr. Probert, who stood 
looking down at the fire, with his back to her. 
" Mr. Probert, I'm very sorry at what I've  done to 
distress you ; I had no idea you would all feel so 
badly. I didn 't mean any harm. I thought you 
would like it." 

The old man turned a little, bending his eyes 
on her, but without taking her hand as she had hoped. 
Usually when they met he kissed her. He did not 







look angry but he looked very ill. A strange in 
articulate sound, a kind of exclamation of amaze 
ment and mirth, came from the others when she 
said she thought they would like it; and indeed 
poor Francie was far from being able to judge of 
the droll effect of that speech " Like it like it ? " 
said Mr. Probert, staring at her as if he were a 
little afraid of her. 

" What do you mean ? She admits she admits ! " 
cried Mine, de Cliche to her sister. " Did you 
arrange it all that day in the Bois to punish me 
for having tried to separate you ? " she pursued, 
to the girl, who stood gazing up piteously at the 
old man. 

" I don 't know what he has published I haven 't 
seen it I don 't understand. I thought it was 
only to be a piece about me." 

" About me ! " M. de Cliche repeated in English. 
" Elle est divine ! " He turned away, raising his 
shoulders and hands and then letting them fall. 

Mme. de Brecourt had picked up the news 
paper ; she rolled it together, saying to Francie that 
she must take it home, take it home immediately 
then she would see. She only seemed to wish to 
get her out of the room. But Mr. Probert had 
fixed the girl with his sick stare. " You gave 
information for that ? You desired it ? " 

" Why, I didn 't desire it, but Mr. Flack did." 

" Why do you know such ruffians ? Where was 
your father ? " the old man groaned. 





" I thought he would just praise my picture and 
give pleasure to Mr. Waterlow," Francie went on. 
" I thought he would just speak about my being 
engaged and give a little account ; so many people 
in America would be interested." 

" So many people in America that s just the 
dreadful thought, my dear," said Mine, de Brecourt^ 
kindly. " Voyons, put it in your muff and tell us 
what you think of it." And she continued to 
thrust forward the scandalous journal. 

But Francie took no notice of it ; she looked 
round from Mr. Probert at the others. " I told 
Gaston I should do something you wouldn 't 
like." 

" Well, he 'll believe it now ! " cried Mme. de 
Cliche. 

" My poor child, do you think he will like it any 
better ? " asked Mme. de Brecourt. 

Francie fastened her eyes on her a moment. 
" He 'll see it over there he has seen it now." 

" Oh, my dear, you 'll have news of him. Don 't 
be afraid ! " laughed Mine, de Cliche. 

" Did he send you the paper ? " the girl went on, 
to Mr. Probert. 

" It was not directed in his hand," said M. de 
Brecourt. " There was some stamp on the band 
it came from the office." 

"Mr. Flack is that his hideous name? 
must have seen to that," Mme. de Brecourt 
suggested. 







" Or perhaps Florine M. de Cliche interposed, 
" I should like to get hold of Florine." 

" I did I did tell him so ! " Francie repeated, 
with her innocent face, alluding to her statement 
of a moment before and speaking as if she 
thought the circumstance detracted from the 
offence. 

v So did I so did we all ! " said Mme. de 
Cliche. 

" And will he surfer as you suffer ? " Francie 
continued, appealing to Mr. Probert. 

" Suffer, suffer ? He 'll die ! " cried the old man. 
" However, I won 't answer for him ; he 'll tell you 
himself, when he returns." 

" He 'll die ? " asked Francie, with expanded 
eyes. 

" He 'll never return how can he show him 
self ? " said Mme. de Cliche. 

" That s not true he 'll come back to stand by 
me ! " the girl flashed out. 

" How could you not feel that we were the last 
- the very last ? " asked Mr. Probert, very gently. 
" How could you not feel that my son was the 
very last ? " 

" C est un sens qui lui manque ! " commented 
Mme. de Cliche. 

" Let her go, papa do let her go home," 
Mme. de Brecourt pleaded. 

" Surely. That s the only place for her to-day!" 
the elder sister continued. 





" Yes, my child you oughtn 't to be here. 
It s your father he ought to understand said 
Mr. Probert. 

" For God s sake don 't send for him let it all 
stop ! " Mme. de Cliche exclaimed. 

Francie looked at her ; then she said, " Good 
bye, Mr. Probert good-bye, Susan." 

" Give her your arm take her to the carnage," 
she heard Mme. de Brecourt say to her husband. 
She got to the door she hardly knew how she 
was only conscious that Susan held her once more 
long enough to kiss her. Poor Susan wanted to 
comfort her ; that showed how bad (feeling as she 
did) she believed the whole business would yet be. 
It would be bad because Gas ton Gaston : Francie 
did not complete that thought, yet only Gaston 
was in her mind as she hurried to the carriage. 
M. de Brecourt hurried beside her ; she would not 
take his arm. But he opened the door for her 
and as she got in she heard him murmur strangely, 
" You are charming, mademoiselle charming, 
charming ! " 



XII. 

HEK absence had not been long and when she 
re-entered the familiar salon at the hotel she found 
her father and sister sitting there together as if 
they were timing her a prey to curiosity and 
suspense. Mr. Dosson however gave no sign of 
impatience ; he only looked at her in silence 
through the smoke of his cigar (he profaned the 
red satin splendour with perpetual fumes,) as she 
burst into the room. No other word than the one 
I use expresses the tell-tale character of poor 
Francie s ingress. She rushed to one of the tables, 
flinging down her muff and gloves, and the next 
moment Delia, who had sprung up as she came in, 
had caught her in her arms and was glaring into 
her face with a " Francie Dosson what have you 
been through ? " Francie said nothing at first, 
only closing her eyes and letting her sister do what 
she would with her. "She has been crying, 
father she has," Delia went on, pulling her down 
upon a sofa and almost shaking her as she con- 





tirmed. "Will you please tell? I've  been 
perfectly wild ! Yes you have, you dreadful ! " 
the elder girl declared, kissing her on the eyes. 
They opened at this compassionate pressure and 
Francie rested them in their beautiful distress on 
her father, who had now risen to his feet and 
stood with his back to the fire. 

" Why, daughter," said Mr. Dosson, " you look 
as if you had had quite a worry." 

" I told you I should I told you, I told you ! " 
Francie broke out, with a trembling voice. " And 
now it s come ! " 

" You don 't mean to say you've  done anything ? " 
cried Delia, very white. 

" It s all over it s all over ! " Francie pursued, 
turning her eyes to her sister. 

" Are you crazy. Francie ? " this young lady 
asked. " I'm sure you look as if you were." 

" Ain 't you going to be married, my child ? " 
asked Mr. Dosson, benevolently, coming nearer 
to her. 

Francie sprang up, releasing herself from her 
sister, and threw her arms around him. "Will 
you take me away, father will you take me right 
away ? " 

" Of course I will, my precious. I 'll take you 
anywhere. I don 't want anything it wasn 't my 
idea ! " And Mr. Dosson and Delia looked at 
each other while the girl pressed her face upon 
his shoulder. 







" I never heard such trash you can 't behave 
that way ! Has he got engaged to some one else 
in America ? " Delia demanded. 

"Why, if it s over it s over. I guess it s all 
right," said Mr. Dosson, kissing his younger 
daughter. " I 'll go back or I 'll go on. I 'll go 
anywhere you like ! " 

"You won 't have your daughters insulted, I 
presume I " Delia cried. " If you don 't tell me 
this moment what has happened I 'll drive straight 
round there and find out." 

" Have they insulted you, sweetie ? " asked the 
old man, bending over the girl, who simply leaned 
upon him with her hidden face, with no sound of 
tears. 

Francie raised her head, turning round upon 
her sister. " Did I ever tell you anything else 
did I ever believe in it for an hour ? " 

" Oh, well, if you've  done it on purpose to 
triumph over me we might as well go home, 
certainly. But I think you had better wait till 
Gaston comes." 

" It will be worse when he comes if he thinks 
the same as they do." 

" Have they insulted you have they ? " Mr. 
Dosson repeated ; while the smoke of his cigar, 
curling round the question, gave him the air of 
asking it with placidity. 

" They think I've  insulted them they're in an 
awful state they're almost dead. Mr. Flack has 





put it into the paper everything, I don 't know 
what and they think it s too fearful. They were 
all there together all at me at once, groaning and 
carrying on. I never saw people so affected." 

Delia listened in bewilderment, staring. " So 
affected ? " 

"Ah, yes, there s a good deal of that," said 
Mr. Dosson. 

" It s too real too terrible ; you don 't under 
stand. It s all printed there that they're immoral, 
and everything about them; everything that s 
private and dreadful." 

" Immoral, is that so ? " Mr. Dosson asked. 

" And about me too, and about Gaston and my 
marriage, and all sorts of personalities, and all 
the names, and Mme. de Villepreux, and every
