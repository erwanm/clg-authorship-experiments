 

through the thicket, and yet to ascend the rock would be 
as easy as to penetrate that mass of roots, boughs, and 
briars. I skirted the edge of the wood for a few steps to 
find some less tangled spot, and to my great joy discovered 
an opening in the thicket, into which I immediately 
plunged, only, however, to retreat in the greatest terror; 
for a horrible breathing sounded in my ears, and I noticed 
a rustling in the boughs above me, which boded no good. 
In my despair I determined to retrace my steps to the 
spot where I had lost my companion, and then strike into 
the path by which we had come from Chilaw. I was 
about to seize my gun and baggage, which I had thrown 
upon the ground, when I heard again the hissing sound 
that had terrified me just before, and turning round, I saw 
not many steps from me, a serpent of gigantic size. 

IX. 

It emerged slowly from the opening which I had per- 
ceived so joyfully, a few moments before, in hopes that it 
would prove a path through the thicket for me. Ring after 
ring unfolded itself, and hemmed in by the abyss, rock, and 
thicket, every means of escape was denied me. I was a 
dead man. The monster glared at me with his flashing 
eyes, his neck swollen with rage. I uttered a shriek of 
horixtr ; for a moment I was motionless with fear ; every 
thing seemed to spin around me, and a sudden faintness 
almost overcome me. How long this lasted I do not know, 
but I was not quite stupified; I hesitated whether to 
plunge head over heels from the precipice or attempt to 



 

climb the rock where it overhung the abyss. I deter- 
mined upon the last ; fear lent wings to my feet. I was 
obliged to jump about five feet before I CDuld fijid a cleft 
for my hands, and I succeeded in reaching it. For some 
seconds I hung over the abyss, vainly trying to find some 
foothold, expecting momentarily, to be seized by the mon 
ster behind me. Most fervently did I pray for strength, 
and at last I managed to find a little ledge for my feet, I 
climbed still higher, until at last my hands grasped the 
summit of the rock and I swung myself upon it. 

Safe, but trembling in every limb, I sank upon the 
ground, for my strength was entirely exhausted by my 
superhuman exertions. My breath failed me ; my heart 
beat violently ; a thick jnist came before my eyes ; I hardly 
recollected where I was or what I had been doing. The 
past seemed to me like a dream, and I should really 
have believed it so, if my eyes had not convinced me that 
I was fifty feet higher than I had been a few momenta 
before, and if my gaze had not fallen upon the gigantic 
serpent so far below me, who was busied in swallowing my 
rice in its goat-skin bag. As soon as he had accomplished 
this, he coiled himself up with a loud hiss, and commenced 
beating up the dust and sand with his tail. 

Secure on the summit of the rock, I considered the 
enormous size of this monster, who was encased in yellow 
and black scales. He must certainly have measured seveaty 
feet in length, and his body was twice as large round as 
mine. From time to time he raised his head as if in 
search of some new prey, but as none was at hf-ud, he 
contracted and lengthened his shining rings, slipped slowly 



 

over trie sand and disappeared in the wood through the 
Bame opening from which he had emerged. 

This horrible, disgusting creature had been the uncon; 
Bcious means of my delivery, for without the excitement 
of the terror which he had caused me, I should never have 
attempted the perilous ascent of the rock. I looked sor- 
rowfully and wistfully at my weapons, which I had left 
behind me, for how was I, deprived of them and my pro- 
visions, and almost naked, to sustain my wretched exist- 
ence. The point which I had now reached was not calca 
lated to relieve my anxiety. The rock that I had just 
ascended was one of this smallest of a circle of steep cliffs 
heaped around, which surrounded a fearful abyss, upon 
whose brink the path that I had been following, appeared 
the only thread of hope left to me. 

As it was already past noon, I continued my journey as 
well as I coxild through the steep cliffs which were piled up 
all around me. When night set in, I chose my resting 
place under an overhanging rock that formed a kind of 
grDtto, kindled my fire, although there was small fear of 
wild beasts among these rocks, and laid my weary head 
upon a broad flat stone that served me for a pillow. But 
spite of my fatigue, I could not sleep, and my thoughts 
busied themselves with painfully analysing my misery. 
It might have been about midnight when I heard a distant 
sound as of the barking of dogs, mingled with faint, hollow 
voices ; they grew louder and louder, and I thought I could 
distinguish the voices of several men talking and laughing 
loudly. I sprang up and felt my heart beat quicker, and 
a cold chili ran up and down my back. I listened ; every 



thing was still around me, when suddenly mocking voices 
again sounded through the air and were answered by the 
echoes from the mountain. 

I listened more attentively, and just behind the cliff 
under which I was, there burst forth a yelling scream that 
almost froze my blood in my veins ; I seized a stone in my 
hand and rushed forward to contend with the Kobolds who 
were teazing me. Then it seemed as if a hundred dis- 
cordant, strange voices were calling all around me, that 
deprived me of the last particle of composure; I thrust 
my fingers into my ears, shut my eyes, and sprang back 
again into the grotto. In my hasty retreat I struck my 
forehead severely against a sharp-pointed rock, and the 
blood which flowed from the wound and mortification at 
my rashness brought me to my senses, of which I never 
stood so much in need as at this moment. These strange 
noises are still inexplicable to me ; they might well have 
shaken the courage of a bolder man than I, and reminded 
me afterwards of the European legends of the Wild Hunts- 
man. Men of weight and understanding in India, to whom 
I have related this adventure, have assured me that such 
wonderful" voices are frequently heard in the mountains 
and forests of Ceylon, and are ascribed by the natives to 
evil spirits. 

After this fatiguing night, in which I did not enjoy one 
moment of refreshing sleep, the day at last broke forth 
frcui the east, and with it I commenced again my hopeless 
journey. I was obliged still to work my way over steep 
rocKS and sharp stones, and was besides, tormented with 
the most violent thirst After a lona search. I rHspn-pprod 



a little water in the hollow of a rock, and this dirty water 
tasted more deliciously to me than any drink that I had 
ever before enjoyed. 

My thirst once quenched, hunger tormented me, and I 
looked in vain for something wherewith to satisfy it, until 
I observed -a, snake about three feet long and as thick as 
my fist, giving chase to a poor little lizard. I seized a 
stone and killed the snake, cut off its head, which I knew 
contained all its venom, stripped off its skin, and roasted 
my prey at a little fire which I had managed, with great 
difficulty, to kindle. 

Whilst I was enjoying this delicious meal, thick clouds 
collected above and around me, enyeloping" me in such a 
mist that I could distinguish nothing around me. I knew 
that these mists sometunes surrounded the mountain-peaks 
for days at a time, and were not unfrequently the precur- 
sors of dreadful storms ; fear of being detained by them 
upon this bare rock, where I should surely perish with 
hunger, determined me to descend, or rather to sBp down 
the mountain in the midst of the mist. After being several 
times almost precipitated from the precipice, I arrived 
safely at the bottom, and found myself again on the bank 
of the old abyss and between two rows of cliffs, where 
I threw myself down utterly exhausted, and did not 
awake from the deep slumber into which I fell, until 
the Bun was tolerably high in the heavens on the follow- 
ing day. 

My limbs felt as if they had been broken on the wheel, 
I shivered with pain and cold, as in the beginning of a 
fever, and jny tormenting thirst and increasing weakness 



 

warned me only too plainly that, unless I was speedily 
delivererJ, I should be beyond all sensation of pain and 
terror in a few days. With these sad forebodings I arose 
from my hard bed, took a few drops of water, and con- 
tinued my way along the edge of the abyss. Evening 
again approached, and filled with despair, I was about to 
throw myself under a tree, to await my death calmly, 
when I perceived at a Httle distance, a spot where the 
brink of the abyss seemed much less fearful, and a path 
across it almost possible. Strengthened anew by the sight, 
I looked around me for some nourishmfent, and succeeded 
in catching by the tail a little alligator that was just slip- 
ping into a hole. I killed it, and prepared a delicious 
meal ; then, protected by a large fire, I lay down to rest. 
On the following morning I began my dangerous journey 
through the thicket, and reached in safety the other bank 
of the abyss, which had been the cause of all my suflFering' 
and misfortunes. A few steps further, and there — a loud 
shout of joy burst from me, my senses forsook me, and I 
Bank fainting on the ground. 

When I came to myself, and stood up, I found myself 
in a broad frequented path, where I discovered quite 
recent footprints. I followed it as quickly as my fatigue 
would allow me to, and soon" encountered a troop of trav- 
elling natives, who were proceeding slowly with their 
mules. They were not a little terrified to behold in this 
wilderness a man wandering towards them, travel-stained 
and hollow-eyed, but received me most kindly when I had 
told them my story,- strengthened me with a most refresh- 
ing Boup, and brought me safely to the coast in three 



 

days. In a short time I found an opportunity to embark, 
and returned safely to my friends and dear ones, who 
were mourning most bitterly my disappearance and proba- 
ble death, and who regarded me almost like one risen 
firom the dead. 





After a short delay on the eastern coast of Madagascar, 
where we had laid in fresh water and provisions, we 
weighed anchor, and with a favourable wind, steered firf 
Java, the place of our destination. It was a beautiful 
November day. I stood on deck enjoying the prospect of 
the quiet sea, congratulating myself that the most tedious 
as well as the most dangerous part of our voyage from 
Holland was accomplished, for the Cape of Good Hope lay 
far behind us, and counting over the profits that our rich 
cargo must ensure us, when all at once the terrible cry of 
fire ! fire ! was heard. I hastened down into the hold, 
whence the cry proceeded, but saw nothing ; to my inquiry 
as to what was burning, one of the sailors replied, " in 
that cask there." I thrust my hand into it, but as I pe 
ceived no fire, I ascended again to the deck to ascertaia 
the cause of the noise. 

The steward had gone down into the hold in the after- 
noon, as usual, to fill a bucket with the spirits which were 
to be distributed to the crew the following day, when after 
accomplishing his task, he took up the candlestick which 
held the tallow candle, and which he had set down upon a 
cask near that from which he had filled his bucket, a spark 
fell into the open bung-hole and the flames burst forth from 
the cask; immediately the top and bottom fell out, aud 


the burning spirit flowed down into the coal hole beneath. 
The careless fellow had, as he told me, poured upon the 
flames several buckets of water that stood near, and entirely 
extinguished them. To make all sure, I gave orders to 
have all the coals damped, and then went my way, think- 
ing no more of the matter. 

Half an hour afterwards some sailors again shouted fire, 
which terrified me greatly ; when I went below the flames 
were already blazing up from the lowest part of the hold ; 
the half extinguished fire had spread fearfully among the 
coals, and unfortunately several rows of brandy casks were 
piled up just above this spot. We hoped now to check 
the rapidly increasing flames, and the greater part of the 
crew brought water in leather buckets and poured it down 
into the hold in torrents. But this led to new and dan- 
gerous consequences ; the water falling upon the glowing 
coals caused such a thick sulphurous smoke that we were 
in danger of stifling, and it was almost impossible to remain 
any longer in the hold. I, however, continued to do so, 
that I might give the necessary orders, desiring my crew 
to work by turns, that they might have every now and 
then a whiflf of fresh air, for I feared that several who 
could not reach the port holes, were already suffocated; 
indeed, I was myself several times so confused that I 
scarcely knew what I was doing, and was obliged to lean 
my head upon a cask and turn my face towards a port-hole 
to get fresh air. 

When, at last, I was forced to go on deck, I wenl. to the 
supercargo, Hein Rol, and told him that I thought it advi- 
sable to throw the powder overboard, but he could not 



 

make up his mind to it. " If we throw our powder into 
the sea," said he, " we may, it is true, tope to extinguish 
the fire, but how, without powder, shall we defend our- 
selves against the enemies who- infest these seas, and how 
shall we justify ourselves if our ship should be taken ?" 
In the meantime the fire was rapidly gaining ground, and 
as no one could any longer endure the sufibcating smoke 
that filled the hold, we seized axes and cut holes in the 
lower deck, through which we poured floods of water 
upon the flames, but with no success in extinguishing 
them. 

Three weeks before our long boat had been fitted for 
sea, and fastened to the stem of the ship ; now we let 
down the boat from the upper deck, as it was in the way 
of the sailors who were bringing water. The confusion 
became greater every moment, we saw ourselves expose 
to the double danger of fire and water, and the sure prey 
of one or the other. We could not hope for help, for there 
was neither land nor ship in sight. The sailors now began 
one by one to slip away ; they let themselves down into 
the water and swam to the long boat, where they concealed 
themselves under the benches, to wait until their number 
should be sufficient to enable them to cut loose from the 
burning vessel. Hein Rol, who was standing on the quar- 
ter deck, was not a little surprised to see the boats so full 
of men ; they cried out to him that they were about to put 
to sea, and that if he wanted to go with them he must 
come quickly. He was easily persuaded, as he was greatly 
terrified, but as he was getting into the long boat, " Wait 
friends," he exclaimed, " till the captain comes." Of course 



 

they listened neither to request nor sommand, but quickly 
cut the rope and pushed off from the ship. 

Whilst I was still issuing orders, and hoping to subdue 
the flames, some of the sailors rushed up to me, exclaim- 
ing in the greatest terror, " Oh, captain, whg,t shall we do ; 
.the boats have both cut loose, and are making off as rap- 
idly as possible." 

'* If that is the case,'\I answered, " things look badly 
enough ; they have determined to leave us to our fate." 

I hastened upon deck, and was soon satisfied of the 
shameful purpose of the cowardly sailors. " Let us bear 
down upon them,"  I cried ; " if they refuse to take us with 
them, they must be taught their duty; we will Jrun them 
down." 

And we had already approached them within three 
ship's lengths, wheii they took the wind of us, and were 
soon out of our reach. " Friends," I said to the remnant 
of my crew, " there is now no help for us save in the mercy 
of God and our own exertions, which we must redouble, 
and once more attempt to stifle the flames. Eun to the 
magazine, and throijv the powder overboard before the fire 
reaches it." I took the carpenters with me, and ordered 
them to bore holes in the ship's side, so as to let a couple 
of fathoms of water into the hold ; but their tools made 
no impression, as the vessel was lined with iron. 

The failure of this last attempt occasioned an indes- 
, cribable panic, and a piercing shriek of terror filled the 
air. At my command they began again to pcur water 
upon the flames, which really began to subside, when sud- 
denly the oil casks caught, and blazed up fearfully. We 



 

now gave ourselves up for lost, for the flames appeared t« 
eain strength from every bucket of water poured upon 
them, and the burning oil ran every where, kindling every 
thing that it touched. In this extremity the crew, who 
had now lost all courage, raised such a horrible scream of 
agony and despair, that my hair stood on end, and the cold, 
sweat started from every pore. 

In their despair, however, they still worked on, pouring 
water into the hold and throwing the powder into the sea. 
Already, of more than three hundred, only sixty casks 
were overboard, when suddenly what remained caught on 
fire, and the ship, in which there were one hundred and 
nineteen souls, was shivered into a thousand fragments. I 
was standing just behind the mainmast, with about thirty 
men near me busy with the water buckets ; in one mo- 
ment of time they had vanished none could say whither; 
the rest shared a like fate. 

As for myself. Captain Wilhem Isbrand Bontekoe, I 
awaited my destruction with the others, stretching my 
arms towards heaven, and exclaiming, " Lord have 
mercy on me !" 

II. 

Although I distinctly felt myself lifted into the air, and 
thought that all was most certainly over with me, I 
retained my perfect consciousness, and a spark of hope still 
glimmered within me. I fell into the sea in the midst of 
the ruins of my shattered vessel. When I found myself in 
the water, my courage revived wonderfully. I seemed quite 
a different man. I looked around me and perceived the 



 

mainmast upon one side of me ; clinging to this, I began 
to consider the sad destruction around m-?, " heaven," 
I sighed, " has then my beautiful ship sunk forever !" 

Wherever I turned I saw no living soul ; bait after a few 
moments, a young man emerged from the water not very 
far from me, and swam hastily. He soon reached the bro- 
ken bowsprit, which was floating near him, placed him- 
self upon it, and said to himself, "I am at least alive!" 
When I heard his voice I looked around and exclaimed, 
" God, does any one beside myself survive !" At the 
same time I recognized in him,Harman Van Kniphausen, 
a young man from Eyden. I saw near him, a stout spar, 
and as I retained my hold, only with the greatest difficulty, 
upon the main-mast, which was continually rolling over, I 
cried out to Harman: "Push that spar towards me; I will 
swim to you upon it, and we will then both seat ourselves 
upon the bowsprit." The attempt succeeded, most fortu- 
tunately, for I should not have been able to reach him 
without the spar, as I felt myself much bruised in the 
back, and had received two wounds upon the head. 

All these injuries, which I had hot felt at first, now be- 
gan to be so painfiil that I could scarcely hear or see, and 
the words broke from me, " heaven if this suffering 
increases I shall die." We swam together, both clinging 
to the bowsprit; from time to time we gazed around in 
hopes of seeing one of the boats; at last we discovered 
them, but at such a distance that we could not tell whether 
they were approaching us or sailing in a different direction. 
The sun was already near its sitting, and I said to my com- 
panion : " Friend, there is no hope for us ; we cannot pos- 



 

sibly keep our hold all night ; we must raise our souls to 
God and pray for a speedy rescue, or for perfect submis- 
sion to his will." We began to pray and our prayers were 
answered, for when we again looked around, we perceived 
the boats quite near to us, to our great joy, for we had cer- 
tainly given ourselves up for lost. 

" Save the captain !" I cried now as loudly as possible, 
and I heard shouted back from the boat, " The captain is 
still living!" They now sailed towards us as fast as pos- 
sible, but were afraid to come close to us, lest the heavy 
bowsprit should injure their boats. Harman, who had been 
very little injured by being blown up, felt strong enough 
to swim, and so was saved. " 

"If you would save me," I cried, "you must come for 
me, for I am so badly wounded that I cannot swim. The 
boatswain, a stout youth, sprang immediately into the 
water and handed me the end of a rope, which I wound 
around my body, and by the mercy of God, at last reached 
the long boat, where all wondered not a little to see me 
again. 

I lay down in the stern to recover myself a little for I 
felt so miserably that I thought my end must be fast ap- 
proaching ; my back was very painful, as were also, the 
wounds in my head. Yet, I recovered myself somewhat,' 
and said to Hein Eol and the others : " We shall do well 
to reniain near the wreck all night long, for when the day 
breaks we can certainly recover something to eat, and per- 
haps we can find a compass, which we must have, if we 
ever hope to reach land." 

Among many almost indispensable things, we wanted 



 

a compass charts, and quadrant ; our provisions, too, were 
very scanty, so great had been the haste to get away from 
the vessel. Hein Kol did not heed my advice, and con- 
tinued to sail on through the night in hopes of seeing land 
in the morning ; but when he saw this hope disappointed, 
and found the next morning that we were still far from 
the land, he remembered my advice, and the men, finding 
me yet alive, cried out to me : " Captain, what will become 
of us ? we are far from the wreck, and can discover no 
land ; we have nothing to eat or drink, and no compass or 
charts, what shall we do ?" 

" My friends," I replied, " you should have followed my 
advice, and remained all night near the wreck, for whilst  I 
was clinging to the mast I saw such quantities of things 
floating about me, that they hindered me from swimming, 
and were quite dangerous."
