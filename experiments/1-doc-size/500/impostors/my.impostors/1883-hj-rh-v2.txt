" Very likely," said Rowland. " I hope she consents." 

"I forget. But tell me," she continued, "shall you 
consider admitting your proposition that in ceasing to 
be nice to Mr. Hudson, so that he may go about his 
business, I do something magnanimous, heroic, sublime 
something with a fine name like that ? " 

Rowland, elated with the prospect of gaining his 
point, was about to reply that she would deserve the 
finest name in the world ; but he instantly suspected 
that this tone would not please her, and besides, it would 
not express his meaning. 


"You do something I shall greatly respect," he con 
tented himself with saying. 

She made no answer, and in a moment she beckoned 
to her maid. " What have I to do to-day ?" she asked. 

Assunta meditated. "Eh, it 's a very busy day! 
Fortunately I have a better memory than the signorina," 
she said, turning to Rowland. She began to count on 
her fingers, " We have to go to the Pie di Marmo to see 
about those laces that were sent to be washed. You 
said also that you wished to say three sharp words to the 
Buonvicini about your pink dress. You want some 
moss rosebuds for to-night, and you won't get them for 
nothing ! You dine at the Austrian Embassy, and that 
Frenchman is to powder your hair. You re to come 
home in time to receive, for the signora gives a dance. 
And so away, away till morning ! " 

"Ah, yes, the moss roses!" Christina murmured 
appreciatively. "I must have a quantity at least a 
hundred. Nothing but buds, eh ? You must sew them 
in a kind of immense apron down the front of my 
dress. Packed tight together, eh? It will be delight 
fully barbarous. And then twenty more or so for my 
hair. They go very well with powder ; don 't you think 
so?" And 's 
Pompadour. 

" Going where?" 

"To the Spanish Embassy, or whatever it is." 

"All down the front, signorina? Dio buono ! You 
must give me time !" Assunta cried. 

"Yes, we will go!" And she left her place. She 
walked slowly to the door of the church, looking at the 
pavement, and Rowland could not guess whether she 
was thinking of her apron of moss rosebuds or of her 
opportunity for moral sublimity. Before reaching the 
door she turned away and stood gazing at an old picture, 
indistinguishable with blackness, over an altar. At last 
they passed out into the court. Glancing at her in the 
open air, Rowland was startled ; he thought he saw the 
traces of hastily-suppressed tears. They had lost time, 
she said, and they must hurry ; she sent Assunta to look 
for a coach. She remained silent a while, scratching 
the ground with the point of her parasol, and then at 
last looking up she thanked Rowland for his confidence 
in her " reasonableness." &lt;( It 's really very comfortable 
to be expected to do something good, after all the horrid 
things one has been used to doing instructed, com 
manded, forced to do ! I will think over what you have 
said to me." In that deserted quarter coaches are rare, 
and there was some delay in Assunta 's procuring one. 
Christina talked of the church, of the picturesque old 
court, of that strange decaying corner of Rome. Row 
land was perplexed ; he was ill at ease. At last the 
cab arrived, but she waited a moment longer. " So, de 
cidedly," she suddenly asked, "I can only harm him?" 

"You make me feel very brutal," said Rowland. 

"And he is such a fine fellow that it would be really 
a great pity, eh?" 

" I shall praise him no more," Rowland said. 

She turned away quickly, but she lingered still. 
" Do you remember promising me, soon after we first 
met, that at the end of six months you would tell me 
definitely what you thought of me ?" 

" It was a foolish promise." 

" You gave it. Bear it in mind. I will think of 
what you have said to me. Farewell." The two 
women stepped into the carriage and it rolled away. 
Rowland stood for some minutes looking after it, and 
then went his way with a sigh. If this expressed general 
mistrust, he ought three days afterwards to have been 
reassured. He received by the post a note containing 
these words : 

" I have done it. Begin and respect me ! 

C. L." 



 

To be perfectly satisfactory, indeed, the note required 
a commentary. Calling that evening upon Roderick, he 
found one in the information offered him at the door by 
the old serving- woman the startling information that 
the signorino had gone to Naples. 



XV. 

ABOUT a month later Rowland addressed to his cousin 
Cecilia a letter, of which the following is a portion : 

. . . "So much for myself ; yet I tell you but a tithe 
of my own story unless I let you know how matters stand 
with poor Hudson, for he gives me more to think about 
just now than anything else in the world. I need a good 
deal of courage to begin this chapter. You warned me, 
you know, and I made rather light of your warning. I 
have had all kinds of hopes and fears, but hitherto, in 
writing to you, I have resolutely put the hopes foremost. 
Now, however, my pride has forsaken me, and I should 
like hugely to give expression to a little comfortable 
despair. I should like to say, My dear wise cousin, 
you were right and I was wrong ; you were a shrewd 
observer, and I was a meddlesome donkey ! When I 
think of a certain talk we had about the salubrity of 
genius, I feel my ears tingle. If this is salubrity, give 
me raging disease ! I am pestered to death ; I go about 
with a chronic heartache ; there are moments when I 
could shed salt tears. There 's a pretty portrait of the 
most placid of men ! I wish I could make you under 
stand ; or rather, I wish you could make me ! I don 't 
understand a jot ; it 's a hideous, mocking mystery ; I 
give it up ! I don 't in the least give it up, you know ; 
I am incapable of giving it up. I sit holding my head 
by the hour, racking my brain, wondering what to invent. 




You told me at Northampton that I took the thing too 
easily ; you would tell me now perhaps that I take it too 
hard. I do, altogether ; but it can't be helped. With 
out flattering myself I may say I am sympathetic. Many 
another man, before this, would have cast his perplexities 
to the winds, and declared that Master Hudson must lie 
on his bed as he had made it. Some men, perhaps, 
would even say that I am making a mighty ado about 
nothing, that I have only to give him rope and he will 
tire himself out. But he tugs at his rope altogether too 
hard for me to hold it comfortably ! I certainly never 
pretended the thing was anything but an experiment ; I 
promised nothing, I answered for nothing ; I only said 
that the case was hopeful, and it would be a shame not 
to give him a chance. I have done my best, and if the 
machine is running down I have a right to stand aside 
and let it rattle. Amen, amen ! No, I can write that, 
but I can't feel it. I can't be just ; I can only be gener 
ous. I am fond of the poor devil, and I can't give him 
up. As for understanding him, that 's another matter ; 
nowadays I don 't believe even you would. One 's wits 
are sadly pestered over here, I assure you, and I am in 
the way of seeing more than one peculiar specimen of 
human nature. Roderick and Miss Light, between them ! 
. . . Haven't I already told you about Miss Light ? 
Last winter everything was perfection. Roderick struck 
out bravely, did really great things, and proved himself, 
as I supposed, thoroughly solid. He was strong, he was 
first -rate; I felt perfectly secure, and paid myself all 
kinds of compliments. We had passed at a bound into 
the open sea and left danger behind. But in the summer 
I began to be uneasy, though I succeeded in not being 
alarmed. When he came back to Rome, however, I saw 
that the tide had turned, and that we were close upon 
the rocks. It is, in fact, another case of Ulysses and the 
Sirens ; only Roderick refuses to be tied to the mast. 
He is the most extraordinary being, the strangest mixture 



 

of qualities. I don 't understand so much force going 
with so much weakness such a brilliant gift being sub 
ject to such lapses. The poor fellow is incomplete, and 
it is really not his own fault ; Nature has given him his 
faculty out of hand, and bidden him be hanged with it ! 
I never knew a man harder to advise or assist, if he is 
not in the mood for listening. I suppose there is some 
key or other to his character, but I try in vain to find it ; 
and yet I can't believe that Providence is so cruel as to 
have turned the lock and thrown the key away. He 
perplexes me to death, and though he tires out my 
patience he still fascinates me. Sometimes I think he 
has not a grain of conscience, and sometimes I think that 
in a way he has an excess. He takes things at once too 
easily and too hard ; he is both too lax and too tense, 
too reckless and too ambitious, too cold and too passion 
ate. He has developed faster even than you prophesied, 
and for good and evil alike he takes up a formidable 
space. There 's too much of him for me, at any rate. 
Yes, he is hard ; there is no mistake about that. He 's 
inflexible, he 's brittle ; and though he has plenty of spirit, 
plenty of soul, he hasn 't what I call a heart. He has 
something that Miss Garland took for one, and I am pretty 
sure she 's a judge. But she judged on scanty evidence. 
He has something that Christina Light, here, makes be 
lieve at times that she takes for one, but she is no judge 
at all ! I think it is established that in the long run 
egotism makes a failure in conduct : is it also true that 
it makes a failure in the arts ? . . . Roderick 's stand 
ard is immensely high ; I must do him that justice. He 
will do nothing beneath it, and while he is waiting for 
inspiration, his imagination, his nerves, his senses must 
have something to amuse them. This is a highly philo 
sophic way of saying that he has taken to riotous living, 
and has just been spending a month at Naples a city 
where pleasure is actively cultivated in very bad 
company. Are they all like that, all the men of genius ? 




There are a great many artists here who hammer away 
at their trade with exemplary industry ; in fact I am 
surprised at their success in reducing the matter to a 
virtuous habit ; but I really don 't think that one of them 
has his exquisite quality of talent. It is in the matter 
of quantity that he has broken down. Nothing comes 
out of the bottle ; he turns it upside down ; it 's no use ! 
Sometimes he declares it 's empty that he has done all 
he was made to do. This I consider great nonsense ; 
but I would nevertheless take him on his own terms if 
it were only I that was concerned. But I keep thinking 
of those two praying, trusting neighbours of yours, and 
I feel uncommonly like a swindler. If his working mood 
came on but once in five years I would willingly wait for 
it, and keep him on his legs somehow in the intervals ; 
but that would be a sorry account to present to them ! 
Five years of this sort of thing, moreover, would effectually 
settle the question. I wish he were less of a genius and 
more of a charlatan ! He 's too confoundedly all of one 
piece ; he won't throw overboard a grain of the cargo to 
save the rest. Fancy him thus with all his brilliant per 
sonal charm, his handsome head, his careless step, his 
look as of a nervous nineteenth-century Apollo, and you 
will understand that there is mighty little comfort in 
seeing him go to the bad. He was tolerably foolish last 
summer at Baden-Baden, but he got on his feet and for 
a while he was steady. Then he began to waver again, 
and at last toppled over. Now, literally, he 's lying 
prone ! He came into my room last night miserably 
tipsy. I assure you it didn 't amuse me. . . . About 
Miss Light it 's a long story. She is one of the great 
beauties of all time, and worth coming barefoot to Rome, 
like the pilgrims of old, to see. Her complexion, her 
glance, her step, her dusky tresses, may have been seen 
before in a goddess, but never in a woman. And you 
may take this for truth, because I am not in love with 
her. On the contrary ! Her education has been simply 



infernal. She is corrupt, perverse, as proud as a poten 
tate, and a coquette of the first magnitude ; but she is 
generous and intelligent, and if you set rightly to work 
you may enlist her imagination in a good cause as well 
as in a bad one. The other day I tried to bring it over 
to my side. I happened to have some talk with her to 
which it was possible to give a serious turn, and I boldly 
broke ground and begged her to suffer my poor friend to 
go in peace. After leading me rather a dance in con 
versation she consented, and the next day, with a single 
word, she packed him off to Naples to drown his sorrow 
in debauchery. I have come to the conclusion that she is 
more dangerous in her virtuous moods than in her vicious 
ones, and that she probably has a way of turning her back 
which is the most provoking thing in the world. She is 
an actress, she couldn 't forego doing the thing dram  lP 
cally, and it was the dramatic touch that made it fatal. 
I washed her, of course, to let him down easily ; but she 
desired to have the curtain drop on an attitude, and her 
attitudes have the property of depriving inflammable 
young artists of their reason. . . . Roderick made an 
admirable bust of her at the beginning of the winter, and 
a dozen women came rushing to him to be done, mutatis 
vmtandis, in the same style. They were all great ladies, 
and ready to take him by the hand, but he told them 
all their faces didn 't interest him, and sent them away 
vowing his destruction." 

At this stage of his long burst of confidence Rowland 
had paused and put by his letter. He kept it three days, 
and then read it over. He was disposed at first to destroy 
it, but he decided finally to keep it, in the hope that it 
might strike a spark of useful suggestion from the flint 
of Cecilia 's good sense. We know he had a talent for 
taking advice. And then it might be, he reflected, that 
his cousin 's answer would throw some light on Mary 
Garland 's present vision of things. In his altered mood 
he added these few lines 




" I unburdened myself the other day of this monstrous 
load of perplexity ; I think it did me good, and I will 
let it stand. I was in a melancholy muddle, and I was 
trying to wriggle out of it. You know I like discussion 
in a quiet way, and there is no one with whom I can 
have it as quietly as with you, most sagacious of cousins ! 
There is an excellent old lady with whom I often chat, 
and who talks very much to the point. But Madame 
Grandoni has disliked Roderick from the first, and if I 
were to take her advice I would wash my hands of him. 
You would laugh at me for my long face*,   mit you would 
do that in any circumstances. I am half ashamed of my 
letter, for I have a faith in my friend that is deeper than 
my doubts. He was here last evening, talking about 
the Naples Museum, the Aristides, the bronzes, the 
Pompeian frescoes, with such a beautiful intelligence that 
doubt of the ultimate future seemed blasphemy. I 
walked back to his lodging with him, and he was as 
mild as midsummer moonlight. He has that ineffable 
something that charms and convinces ; my last word 
about him shall not be a harsh one. " 

Shortly after sending his letter, going one day into his 
friend 's studio, he found Roderick suffering the honour 
able torture of a visit from Mr. Leavenworth. Roderick 
submitted with extreme ill grace to being bored, and he 
was now evidently in a state of high exasperation. He 
had lately begun a representation of a lazzarone lounging 
in the sun ; an image of serene, irresponsible, sensuous 
life. The real lazzarone, he had admitted, was a vile 
fellow ; but the ideal lazzarone and his own had been 
subtly idealised was the flower of a perfect civilisation. 

Mr. Leavenworth had apparently just transferred his 
unhurrying gaze to the figure. 

" Something in the style of the Dying Gladiator?" he 
sympathetically observed. 

"Oh no," said Roderick, seriously, "he is not dying, 
he is only drunk !" 



 

"Ah, but intoxication, you know," Mr. Leaven worth 
rejoined, "is not a proper subject for sculpture. Sculp 
ture should not deal with transitoiy attitudes." 

"Lying dead drunk is not a transitory attitude! 
Nothing is more permanent, more sculpturesque, more 
monumental !" 

"An entertaining paradox," said Mr. Leavenworth, 
" if we had time to exercise our wits upon it. I remem 
ber at Florence an intoxicated figure by Michael Angelo 
which seemed to me a deplorable aberration of a great 
mind. I myself touch liquor in no shape whatever. I have 
travelled through Europe on cold water. The most varied 
and attractive lists of wines are offered me, but I brush them 
aside. No cork has ever been drawn at my command ! " 

" The movement of drawing a cork calls into play a 
very pretty set of muscles," said Roderick. " I think I 
will make a figure in that position." 

"A Bacchus realistically treated! My dear young 
friend, never trifle with your lofty mission. Spotless 
marble should represent virtue, not vice ! " And Mr. 
Leavenworth placidly waved his hand, as if to exorcise 
the spirit of levity, while his glance journeyed with 
leisurely benignity to another object a marble replica 
of the bust of Christina. "An ideal head, I presume," 
he went on; "a fanciful representation of one of the 
pagan goddesses a Diana, a Flora, a naiad or dryad ? 
I often regret that our American artists should not boldly 
cast off that extinct nomenclature. " 

" She is neither a naiad nor a dryad," said Roderick, 
" and her name is as good as yours or mine." 

"You call her ?" Mr. Leavenworth blandly in 
quired. 

" Christina Light," Rowland interposed in charity. 

"Ah, our great American beauty ! Not a pagan god 
dess an American Christian lady ! Yes, I have had 
the pleasure of conversing with Miss Light. Her con 
versational powers are not remarkable, but her beauty is 



 

of a high order. I observed her the other evening at a 
large party, where some of the proudest members of the 
European aristocracy were present duchesses, princesses, 
countesses, and others distinguished by similar titles. But 
for beauty, grace, and elegance my fair countrywoman left 
them all nowhere. What woman can compare with a truly 
refined American lady ? The duchesses the other night 
had no attractions for my eyes ; they looked coarse and 
sensual ! It seemed to me that the tyranny of class dis 
tinctions must indeed be terrible when such countenances 
could inspire admiration. You see more beautiful girls 
in an hour on Broadway than in the whole tour of 
Europe. Miss Light now, on Broadway, would excite 
no particular remark." 

"Oh, damn Broadway !" Roderick murmured. 

Mr. Leavenworth stared, as if this were unpatriotic ; 
then he resumed, almost severely " I suppose you have 
heard the news about our fair countiy woman." 

"What news?" Roderick had stood with his back 
turned, fiercely poking at his lazzarone ; but at Mr. 
Leavenworth 's last words he faced quickly about. 

It 's the news of the hour, I believe. Miss Light is 
admired by the highest people here. They tacitly recog 
nise her superiority. She has had offers of marriage from 
various great lords. I was extremely happy to learn this 
circumstance, and to know that they had all been left 
sighing. She has not been dazzled by their titles and 
their gilded coronets. She has judged them simply as 
men, and found them wanting. One of them, however, 
a young Neapolitan prince, I believe, has, after a long 
probation, succeeded in making himself acceptable. Miss 
Light has at last said yes, and the engagement has just 
been announced. I am not generally a reporter of the 
gossip of the passing hour, but the fact was alluded to an 
hour ago by a lady with whom I was conversing, and 
here in Europe these conventional futilities usurp the 
lion 's share of one 's attention. I therefore retained the 



 

circumstance in my mind. Yes, I regret that Miss Light 
should marry one of these used-up foreigners. Ameri 
cans should stand by each other. If she wanted a bril 
liant match we could have organised it for her. If she 
wanted a fine fellow a fine, sharp, enterprising, 
modern man I would have undertaken to find him 
for her without going out of my native city Columbus, 
Ohio. And if she wanted a big fortune, I would have 
found her twenty that she would have had hard work 
to spend ; money down not tied up in fever-stricken 
lands and worm-eaten villas ! What is the name 
of the young man? Prince Castaway, or some such 
thing !" 

It was well for Mr. Leavenworth that he was fond of 
listening to his own correct periods ; for the current of 
his eloquence floated him past the short, sharp, startled 
cry with which Roderick greeted his anecdote. The young 
man stood looking at him with parted lips and an excited 
eye. 

" The position of woman," Mr. Leavenworth thought 
fully resumed, " is certainly a very degraded one in these 
countries. I doubt whether a European princess can 
command the respect which in our country is exhibited 
towards the obscurest females. The civilisation of a 
country should be measured by the deference shown to 
the weaker sex. Judged by that standard, where are 
they over here ?" 

Though Mr. Leavenworth had not observed Roderick 's 
emotion it was not lost upon Rowland, who was making 
sundry uncomfortable reflections upon it. He saw that 
it had instantly become one with the acute irritation pro 
duced by the poor gentleman 's oppressive personality, 
and that an explosion of some sort was imminent. Mr. 
Leavenworth, with calm unconsciousness, proceeded to 
fire the mine. 

"And now for our Culture!" he said in the same 
sonorous tones, demanding with a gesture the unveiling
