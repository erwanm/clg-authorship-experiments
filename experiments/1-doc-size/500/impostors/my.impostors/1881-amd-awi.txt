of mercenary consideration ? 

The house seems quiet the next day, as if some one had 
died. There comes a telegram ; Dolly stood the journey 
very well and is improving. On the next day a letter, 
tender, half -penitent for the trouble she has made, hope- 
ful, inconsequent, eager, and full of interest in bridal 
raiment. "I wish you were here," she says, "Helen is 
so queer and glum ; she acts as if she really did not want 
me to be married. It isn't all Brower's death, I know ; 
and I miss your great, warm, generous nature at every 
turn. My dear, you will never find anyone to fully appre- 
ciate you until you get to heaven. The people in this 
world are so much smaller than you, that the contrast is 
not agreeable to them. I wish you could be delightfcdly 
happy in the trifles that make up most women's lives." 

Is Mrs. Stannard happy, she wonders, and then she 
answers her own question. She has been able to see un- 
derneath the froth and sparkle of society, and has been 
appalled by the dregs and ashes. She, too, has seen a 
possibility of a broad and splendid life, and it seems as 
if, in the years to come, it might be hers. As for herself, 
Christmas, she must gird up her soul and go at duties reso- 
lutely. There are many women who never are crowned 
by love. She can put nothing less, nothing lower in this 
place. But there is a wide world of work, there are many 
pleasures, and we need not make life barren or vapid. 

Miss Ormiston cannot tell why, but in these days she 
avoids the factory. She goes back to hejrlong rides, 
mounted on Jasper, that seems to enjoy the ripe, breezy 
autumn air as much as she. Friends are asked in for 
nearly every evening, and she accepts invitations; for 
since she must live, since she cannot be swept out of 
existence by a mere sense of weariness, her first duly is 
to overcome the lassitude and despondency that benumb 
her very soul. 



 



 




The next note from Dolly has the completed arrange- 
mentB. They will be married quietly at the hotel on Sat- 
urday morning, and sail immediately. There is less than 
a fortnight now. Every day she longs for Christmas, 
Helen is so dull and gloomy. She has half a mind to 
come back to Ormiston and bring Christmas herself* 
" Tell me what day you will come," she pleads. 

Miss Ormiston has not meant to go at all. She has had 
a curious presentiment that something would intervene ; 
but she is well, and there is no earthly reason that she 
can make plausible to Dolly. She has not answered her 
yet, when in the mail sent up one morning there is a 
note that fills her with wildest dismay, a brief line from 
Jeffries, simply pointing out that he has requested Mr. 
St. George to see her upon a matter that concerns him, 
in which she will use her efforts to restore him to liberty 
at once. 

Christmas Ormiston sits like a statue, stunned with the 
task still before her. She has not even moved when Mr. 
St. Oeorge is announced. There is an aspect of resolu- 
tion in his face, that bodes ill for concealment or any 
sentimental pity. His eyes will be clear to cut through 
any weak subterfuge. 

The greeting is cordial but brief. That he is greatly 
disturbed is evident. 

"Miss Ormiston," he begins, " that you are not igno- 
rant of a base and impudent forgery upon Ormiston Mills, 
Mr. Donaldson has informed me. He wrote to me imme- 
diately, and learning that Jeffries or Carew, whichever 
may be his true name, was in New York, I had him ar- 
rested. He is now in prison and will be held to answer 
for the charge." 

There is a constriction in her throat, and her lips deny 
the words that seem to plead for him. 

" There can be no good reason for refusing to prose- 
cute " ; and his eyes seem to study every line of her face* 



 



 



" Yet he referred me to you, and gave me a message of 
such ambiguity and insolence that I shall not repeat it. 
Yon need not act in the matter at all, but the man must 
be punished." 

Still she makes no comment. Her face is like marble, 
inscrutable. 

" There is some mystery I cannot pretend to under- 
stand.'' Then he comes nearer, and his eyes are bent upon 
her with a compelling look that nearly sweeps her from 
her intrenchment of self. 

" Let me tell you, and I think then you will have no sen- 
timent of mercy in regard to him ; he gave me the impression 
the Sunday night of Mr. Stannard*s death, as we were walk- 
ing back together, that he was deeply in love with you, and 
that, from some far-back sympathy, you were inclined to 
favor his suit. He confessed himself Mr. Treverton's 
step-son with inimitable ease and daring. Circumstances 
have since convinced me that he — " 

'' That it was a base falsehood," she flings out of white 
lips, rising and facing him with a pure, proud dignity. 
"The curious likeness to some one well known in the 
past puzzled me at first, still," she adds haughtQy, "- he 
was no guest of my choosing." 

" No, I am answerable for his entrance at Grlen Ormis- 
tcm, and I cannot have you suffer a second time through 
any imprudence of mine. It is my duty to have the man 
punished for his crime. His very daring and audacity 
show how dangerous he may become." 

'' But — you are going away," she says with a curious 
indecision. " And do you not see " — her face crimsons 
and her eyes are downcast " that I mtist appear? I 
filled in the amount of the check. I might have made 
it for a larger amount," she adds in this cruel strait. 

" Did you? " he asks simply. 

If Dolly is still in peril, she cannot save her by this 
falsehood. She can take unjust blame, but she will not 



 



 





tftain her soul. She collects her stray senses, for it has 
all come so suddenly, and decides. 

" No," she makes answer. " It was five hundred dol- 
lars, as I told Mr. Donaldson. It was for a friend, and 
a matter in which I tried to do my best. But I cannot 
bear witness against the man " ; and she is so deadly white 
that it seems as if she had fainted. '' Lethimgo. With- 
draw the charge as a mistake.'' 

If this woman is not truth and honor and purity, then 
there is no womanhood for high and perfect faith. True, 
in the old time — her childhood, girlhood - there might have 
been a compromising tenderness. He thinks of Dolly's 
many lovers, and for a moment shrinks in disgust from 
the vows he is so soon to take. The traitorous secret he 
has seen in Helen Stannard*s face rises up before him an 
unquietghost. Are women all alike ? Is it Duessa always, 
and no heavenly Una? He must know, even though 
either way the knowledge can only add a pang. 

" Miss Ormiston," he says, in a quiet but intense voice, 
" I do not desire to question the fancy of your girlhood, 
but if there should be any letters or such matters in his 
possession — " 

"- Not of mine," she answers, with the bitterness of scorn 
in her tone. " Yes, I did write to him once," she admits. 
'' He was his mother's favorite, and when I was sent to 
school, homesick, wretched, and forlorn, I wrote to him to 
beg him to intercede with his mother that I might come 
home. It is hardly likely he would keep such an unim- 
portant scrawl. But it is not worth while for any one to 
be merciful or generous to him on that score." And she 
smiles with ineffable disdain. " One would be wild to let 
him make any capital out of that. Let me warn you, if 
you had any such thoughts." 

No, it is not for herself that she pardons this man. A 
great thrill of satisfaction penetrates his farthest pulses. 
If she can be nothing to him, he is proud to know her free 
from past entanglements. 



 



 



 

There comes to him a kind of second sight and sense* 
Has he one small thread of the clew in his hands ? 

" Then,' he says, with a quiet calmness, "it is yonr 
wish the man shall not be prosecuted? " 

She chooses for Dolly's sake. A shock like this wonld 
be fatal. 

" It is my desire," she says dearly. Then she feels 
that she has a right to justify herself to him. ''It is for 
the best interest of a third person. That is all the ex- 
planation I can make." 

'' Thank you," he returns. Then he bids her farewell, 
without glancing at her face. It is well that he is not to 
see her again for a long while, for he feels positiye, as 
DpUy has been, that Christmas Ormiston will not be their 
wedding guest. In his perfect integrity he will not think 
any future possible, but look only at the duty before him, 
fulfil it to the letter. Is there some curious premonition 
that she has a reason for standing apart and cold, with 
firm lips and steady eyes that would seem to a careless 
observer as if the breach between them was wide and 
deep for all time, too wide for even friendship to cross? 

But once out of the electric atmosphere, a quick resolve 
came to St. George. That this third person was Dolly, 
he felt certain. It could make no difference now, it could 
not alter one plan, yet his blood rushed to fever heat to 
exonerate Christmas Ormiston from the least shadow of 
blame. At last she stood forth purely noble and generous 
in his mind ; a late revelation, yethe hugged the knowledge 
to his soul as some treasure that not even death could 
take from him. 

It is late when he reaches the city, too late for an inter- 
view with Jeffries. He goes at once to the hotel, where 
he finds Mrs. Stannard strangely restless, pacing the fioor 
in a soft, trailing black gown, that gives her a startlingly 
beautiful appearance. 

Dolly is on the sofa. She holds out the whitest hand, 



 



 




it might be wax, it has not the rigidity of marble. He 
looks to find her petulant and impatient, but she is 
neither. 

" I thooght yon were never coming," she says with a 
kind of regretful softness. " Helen would not order the 
dinner. She has been fretting and fuming." 

" Anxious," corrects Mrs. Stannard shortly. " I could 
not think what had kept you away, and one has a hun- 
dred fears at such a time. Dolly never did take any care 
on her shoulders," complainingly. 

" And why should I now? You two oould care for a 
raiment." 

'' Thank you ; I find my hands full enough with one," 
the elder sister says, pointedly. 

" Order the dinner. Some peaches and grapes for 
me." 

The waiter brings it in and arranges the table. St. 
Gkorge sits by Dolly, holding her hand, with none of the 
repulsion he had expected would sway him. She has a 
strange, light, unearthly beauty that seems melting away 
at every moment. Her eyes are soft, lustrous, dreamy ; 
her pretty mouth is like a child's, softened with something 
not quite a smile that comes and goes like a wavering 
touch of illumination. 

" Come," he says, when the table is in order. 

" I am so comfortable, I do not want to be disturbed. 
Bring my grapes here " ; and she motions to the table that 
holds her bouquet sent in this morning. " Now take your 
dinner and soften into good-nature, both of you, so you 
can entertain me afterward. Where have you been? Tell 
Helen your day's adventure and I shall listen." 

" It was some perplexing business that will not interest 
you," he returns gravely. 

"You do not know. I am going to give up frivolity, 
and take to serious pursuits. You will be amazed at the 
kind of woman I shall make." 



 



 



 

Helen Stannard frowns a little. 

" It wag out of the city," says Dolly. "Ton spoke of 
the train." 

" Really, I shall have to be carefol if you are going to 
be so penetrating. You will discover all my secrets." 

" I 'm not curious about secrets," DoUy returns, lan- 
guidly. "We will lock up the past on Saturday, and 
brgin anew." 

The two at the table chat in a desultory fashion, with an 
occasional comment from Dolly. Then the fragments are 
sent away, except the fruit, and St. Greorge returns to the 
sofa. 

" You have not touched your grapes," he says in sur- 
prise. You eat nothing." 

" Then I must be in love," she replies, in a quaint irre- 
sistible tone. 

He stoops and kisses her. Her forehead is cool and 
purely white, with stray curling ends of golden-brown hair, 
and her drooping eyelids are blue with veins crossing and 
recrossing. 

" Now go and play for me," she requests. " The So- 
nata Pathetique. Christmas played it one evening in the 
twilight. I don't know why, but your playing makes mo 
think of her." 

The windows are closed, and up at this height there is 
no roar from the busy street below. Helen has lowered 
the lights, and St. Greorge, seating himself, plays with inef- 
fable tenderness. What is sTie doing at Glen Ormiston in 
that great, lonely house? What will she do with all the 
years to come? 

Beethoven is St. George's favorite master. This dreamy 
playing takes him back to nights with his father. What 
strange mood has come over Dolly, or is there some latent 
capability in every woman's soul? Has he fought out his 
battle and come off victor? for he looks at the future with 
nnshrinking eyes, and softens marvellously toward the 



 



 





woman who is to be his wife a few days hence. Fanlty 
she certainly is, but does he care to plunge into the past 
that she has hidden away? Will he wring anything out 
of Jeffries to-morrow morning ; any secret that he would 
not like confronting him when she sat at his table and 
shared his daily life ? 

" Dolly must be asleep,' Helen says in one of the 
pauses. " Dolly ! " raising her yoice a trifle. 

There is no answer. 

" Don't play any more,' Mrs. Stannard exclaims. There 
is a curious jealousy at fever heat in her veins. So soon 
he will belong to another. All these years he has been 
free, and the want has been slowly crystallizing, the hope- 
less, passionless longing for something she had blindly 
put away, and now, when she knows what it is, and is 
free, when a few more months would give her the right to 
incline this soul gently towards herself, he will be beyond 
that boundary, his life wasted upon futQe and frivolous 
endeavors. 

He looks at his watch presently. << It is late," he ex- 
claims in surprise. ''Is Dolly sleeping all this while?" 
Then he crosses the room to her sofa. She has turned 
her face over on the pillow, and dropped it down a little. 
The long lashes sweep the cheek which has the smooth 
frost look of marble, and the color has all gone out of the 
lovely, slightly parted lips. He takes the hand with a 
great shock of fear, and it is cold, pulseless ; the face is 
cold; the heart has stopped beating, worn to its last 
thread. Dolly Allaire has gone to some other country, 
some other, infinite Judgment, and he resolves not to know, 
not to Judge anything that she has withheld from his 
keeping. 

Helen utters a wild shriek and faints quite away. Fanny 
is summoned and oHxeT assistance, but Dolly rests in sweet 
unconsciousness with a child's expression on her face that 
is sweeter than in life. He could look at her forever.



 



 



 

She has never been in hiB life in any vital sense of possea* 
sion, and there is no awful consciousness of personal loss ; 
but if he could he would bring her back to the life she loved 
so well, even if he gave her his life also. 

Christmas is shocked by the summons, yet not greatly 
surprised, knowing what she did. Dolly is to be taken to 
Meadowcrof t, and though there is a large concourse of 
people to do her honor, there are but three of the nearest. 
Helen seems turned into stone ; there is an uneasy sense 
in her soul, like an unquiet ghost, but Christmas has no 
such follower. She is doubly thankful that she could do 
anything to bless Dolly's last days, even at a great sacri- 
fice. St. Greorge is the brother friend he has always been, 
doubly a brother now. 

There is a shivering, ghostly gloom at Meadowcroft. 
The old brightness has vanished everywhere, even the 
cosy home look Christmas has been wont to dream over. 
The new Mrs. Allaire has impressed it with the conven- 
tional aspect of money, and on an occasion like this its 
loneliness is intolerable. Even Helen will not remain all 
night. After they have laid DoUy Allaire beside her 
father, they take the train to the city. It is all so strange 
and unreal to Christmas. 

She does not inquire about Jeffries, every thought con- 
cerning him is repugnant. In some occult, sympathetic 
way she feels that St. George will see the matter in her 
light. Better a hundred times that the money should go. 
Ormiston Mills can stand that in the tide of its prosperity. 

Leighton St. Greorge makes his own terms with Jeffries 
Carew, one item of which is that they will withdraw the 
prosecution if he leaves the country immediately. 

''You once had a letter of Miss Ormiston's that she 
wrote when at school," Mr. St. George says. <' If it is 
still in existence, you can transfer it to me.'' 

'' Why should I save a scrawl like that I'' and for once 
he tells the truth, though he flings it out sullenly. He can
