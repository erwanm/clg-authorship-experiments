There are moods in which one feels the impulse to enter a tacit protest
against too gross an appetite for pure aesthetics in this starving and
sinning world. One turns half away, musingly, from certain beautiful
useless things. But the healthier state of mind surely is to lay no tax
on any really intelligent manifestation of the curious, and exquisite.
Intelligence hangs together essentially, all along the line; it only
needs time to make, as we say, its connections. The massive pastiche
of Vincigliata has no superficial use; but, even if it were less
complete, less successful, less brilliant, I should feel a reflective
kindness for it. So disinterested and expensive a toy is its own
justification; it belongs to the heroics of dilettantism.

One grows to feel the collection of pictures at the Pitti Palace
splendid rather than interesting. After walking through it once or twice
you catch the key in which it is pitched--you know what you are
likely not to find on closer examination; none of the works of the
uncompromising period, nothing from the half-groping geniuses of the
early time, those whose colouring was sometimes harsh and their outlines
sometimes angular. Vague to me the principle on which the pictures
were originally gathered and of the aesthetic creed of the princes who
chiefly selected them. A princely creed I should roughly call it--the
creed of people who believed in things presenting a fine face to
society; who esteemed showy results rather than curious processes, and
would have hardly cared more to admit into their collection a work by
one of the laborious precursors of the full efflorescence than to see a
bucket and broom left standing in a state saloon. The gallery contains
in literal fact some eight or ten paintings of the early Tuscan
School--notably two admirable specimens of Filippo Lippi and one of the
frequent circular pictures of the great Botticelli--a Madonna, chilled
with tragic prescience, laying a pale cheek against that of a blighted
Infant. Such a melancholy mother as this of Botticelli would have
strangled her baby in its cradle to rescue it from the future. But of
Botticelli there is much to say. One of the Filippo Lippis is perhaps
his masterpiece--a Madonna in a small rose-garden (such a “flowery
close” as Mr. William Morris loves to haunt), leaning over an Infant who
kicks his little human heels on the grass while half-a-dozen curly-pated
angels gather about him, looking back over their shoulders with the
candour of children in tableaux vivants, and one of them drops an
armful of gathered roses one by one upon the baby. The delightful
earthly innocence of these winged youngsters is quite inexpressible.
Their heads are twisted about toward the spectator as if they were
playing at leap-frog and were expecting a companion to come and take
a jump. Never did “young” art, never did subjective freshness, attempt
with greater success to represent those phases. But these three fine
works are hung over the tops of doors in a dark back room--the bucket
and broom are thrust behind a curtain. It seems to me, nevertheless,
that a fine Filippo Lippi is good enough company for an Allori or a
Cigoli, and that that too deeply sentient Virgin of Botticelli might
happily balance the flower-like irresponsibility of Raphael’s “Madonna
of the Chair.”

Taking the Pitti collection, however, simply for what it pretends to
be, it gives us the very flower of the sumptuous, the courtly, the
grand-ducal. It is chiefly official art, as one may say, but it presents
the fine side of the type--the brilliancy, the facility, the amplitude,
the sovereignty of good taste. I agree on the whole with a nameless
companion and with what he lately remarked about his own humour on
these matters; that, having been on his first acquaintance with
pictures nothing if not critical, and held the lesson incomplete and
the opportunity slighted if he left a gallery without a headache, he
had come, as he grew older, to regard them more as the grandest of
all pleasantries and less as the most strenuous of all lessons, and to
remind himself that, after all, it is the privilege of art to make us
friendly to the human mind and not to make us suspicious of it. We do
in fact as we grow older unstring the critical bow a little and strike
a truce with invidious comparisons. We work off the juvenile impulse
to heated partisanship and discover that one spontaneous producer isn’t
different enough from another to keep the all-knowing Fates from smiling
over our loves and our aversions. We perceive a certain human solidarity
in all cultivated effort, and are conscious of a growing accommodation
of judgment--an easier disposition, the fruit of experience, to take
the joke for what it is worth as it passes. We have in short less of a
quarrel with the masters we don’t delight in, and less of an impulse
to pin all our faith on those in whom, in more zealous days, we fancied
that we made our peculiar meanings. The meanings no longer seem quite so
peculiar. Since then we have arrived at a few in the depths of our own
genius that are not sensibly less striking.

And yet it must be added that all this depends vastly on one’s mood--as
a traveller’s impressions do, generally, to a degree which those who
give them to the world would do well more explicitly to declare. We have
our hours of expansion and those of contraction, and yet while we follow
the traveller’s trade we go about gazing and judging with unadjusted
confidence. We can’t suspend judgment; we must take our notes, and the
notes are florid or crabbed, as the case may be. A short time ago I
spent a week in an ancient city on a hill-top, in the humour, for which
I was not to blame, which produces crabbed notes. I knew it at the
time, but couldn’t help it. I went through all the motions of liberal
appreciation; I uncapped in all the churches and on the massive ramparts
stared all the views fairly out of countenance; but my imagination,
which I suppose at bottom had very good reasons of its own and knew
perfectly what it was about, refused to project into the dark old town
and upon the yellow hills that sympathetic glow which forms half the
substance of our genial impressions. So it is that in museums and
palaces we are alternate radicals and conservatives. On some days we ask
but to be somewhat sensibly affected; on others, Ruskin-haunted, to be
spiritually steadied. After a long absence from the Pitti Palace I went
back there the other morning and transferred myself from chair to
chair in the great golden-roofed saloons--the chairs are all gilded and
covered with faded silk--in the humour to be diverted at any price. I
needn’t mention the things that diverted me; I yawn now when I think of
some of them. But an artist, for instance, to whom my kindlier judgment
has made permanent concessions is that charming Andrea del Sarto. When
I first knew him, in my cold youth, I used to say without mincing that
I didn’t like him. Cet âge est sans pitié. The fine sympathetic,
melancholy, pleasing painter! He has a dozen faults, and if you insist
pedantically on your rights the conclusive word you use about him will
be the word weak. But if you are a generous soul you will utter it
low--low as the mild grave tone of his own sought harmonies. He is
monotonous, narrow, incomplete; he has but a dozen different figures and
but two or three ways of distributing them; he seems able to utter but
half his thought, and his canvases lack apparently some final return on
the whole matter--some process which his impulse failed him before he
could bestow. And yet in spite of these limitations his genius is both
itself of the great pattern and lighted by the air of a great period.
Three gifts he had largely: an instinctive, unaffected, unerring grace;
a large and rich, and yet a sort of withdrawn and indifferent sobriety;
and best of all, as well as rarest of all, an indescribable property
of relatedness as to the moral world. Whether he was aware of the
connection or not, or in what measure, I cannot say; but he gives, so to
speak, the taste of it. Before his handsome vague-browed Madonnas; the
mild, robust young saints who kneel in his foregrounds and look round
at you with a conscious anxiety which seems to say that, though in the
picture, they are not of it, but of your own sentient life of commingled
love and weariness; the stately apostles, with comely heads and
harmonious draperies, who gaze up at the high-seated Virgin like early
astronomers at a newly seen star--there comes to you the brush of the
dark wing of an inward life. A shadow falls for the moment, and in it
you feel the chill of moral suffering. Did the Lippis suffer, father
or son? Did Raphael suffer? Did Titian? Did Rubens suffer? Perish
the thought--it wouldn’t be fair to us that they should have had
everything. And I note in our poor second-rate Andrea an element of
interest lacking to a number of stronger talents.

Interspersed with him at the Pitti hang the stronger and the weaker
in splendid abundance. Raphael is there, strong in portraiture--easy,
various, bountiful genius that he was--and (strong here isn’t the word,
but) happy beyond the common dream in his beautiful “Madonna of the
Chair.” The general instinct of posterity seems to have been to
treat this lovely picture as a semi-sacred, an almost miraculous,
manifestation. People stand in a worshipful silence before it, as they
would before a taper-studded shrine. If we suspend in imagination on the
right of it the solid, realistic, unidealised portrait of Leo the Tenth
(which hangs in another room) and transport to the left the fresco of
the School of Athens from the Vatican, and then reflect that these were
three separate fancies of a single youthful, amiable genius we recognise
that such a producing consciousness must have been a “treat.” My
companion already quoted has a phrase that he “doesn’t care for
Raphael,” but confesses, when pressed, that he was a most remarkable
young man. Titian has a dozen portraits of unequal interest. I never
particularly noticed till lately--it is very ill hung--that portentous
image of the Emperor Charles the Fifth. He was a burlier, more imposing
personage than his usual legend figures, and in his great puffed sleeves
and gold chains and full-skirted over-dress he seems to tell of a
tread that might sometimes have been inconveniently resonant. But the
purpose to have his way and work his will is there--the great stomach
for divine right, the old monarchical temperament. The great Titian, in
portraiture, however, remains that formidable young man in black, with
the small compact head, the delicate nose and the irascible blue eye.
Who was he? What was he? “Ritratto virile” is all the catalogue is
able to call the picture. “Virile!” Rather! you vulgarly exclaim. You
may weave what romance you please about it, but a romance your dream
must be. Handsome, clever, defiant, passionate, dangerous, it was not
his own fault if he hadn’t adventures and to spare. He was a gentleman
and a warrior, and his adventures balanced between camp and court.
I imagine him the young orphan of a noble house, about to come into
mortgaged estates. One wouldn’t have cared to be his guardian, bound to
paternal admonitions once a month over his precocious transactions with
the Jews or his scandalous abduction from her convent of such and such a
noble maiden.

The Pitti Gallery contains none of Titian’s golden-toned groups; but
it boasts a lovely composition by Paul Veronese, the dealer in silver
hues--a Baptism of Christ. W---- named it to me the other day as the
picture he most enjoyed, and surely painting seems here to have proposed
to itself to discredit and annihilate--and even on the occasion of such
a subject--everything but the loveliness of life. The picture bedims and
enfeebles its neighbours. We ask ourselves whether painting as such can
go further. It is simply that here at last the art stands complete.
The early Tuscans, as well as Leonardo, as Raphael, as Michael, saw the
great spectacle that surrounded them in beautiful sharp-edged elements
and parts. The great Venetians felt its indissoluble unity and
recognised that form and colour and earth and air were equal members
of every possible subject; and beneath their magical touch the hard
outlines melted together and the blank intervals bloomed with meaning.
In this beautiful Paul Veronese of the Pitti everything is part of
the charm--the atmosphere as well as the figures, the look of radiant
morning in the white-streaked sky as well as the living human limbs, the
cloth of Venetian purple about the loins of the Christ as well as the
noble humility of his attitude. The relation to Nature of the other
Italian schools differs from that of the Venetian as courtship--even
ardent courtship--differs from marriage.

I went the other day to the secularised Convent of San Marco, paid my
franc at the profane little wicket which creaks away at the door--no
less than six custodians, apparently, are needed to turn it, as if it
may have a recusant conscience--passed along the bright, still cloister
and paid my respects to Fra Angelico’s Crucifixion, in that dusky
chamber in the basement. I looked long; one can hardly do otherwise. The
fresco deals with the pathetic on the grand scale, and after taking
in its beauty you feel as little at liberty to go away abruptly as
you would to leave church during the sermon. You may be as little of
a formal Christian as Fra Angelico was much of one; you yet feel
admonished by spiritual decency to let so yearning a view of the
Christian story work its utmost will on you. The three crosses rise high
against a strange completely crimson sky, which deepens mysteriously
the tragic expression of the scene, though I remain perforce vague as to
whether this lurid background be a fine intended piece of symbolism or
an effective accident of time. In the first case the extravagance quite
triumphs. Between the crosses, under no great rigour of composition,
are scattered the most exemplary saints--kneeling, praying, weeping,
pitying, worshipping. The swoon of the Madonna is depicted at the left,
and this gives the holy presences, in respect to the case, the strangest
historical or actual air. Everything is so real that you feel a vague
impatience and almost ask yourself how it was that amid the army of his
consecrated servants our Lord was permitted to suffer. On reflection you
see that the painter’s design, so far as coherent, has been simply to
offer an immense representation of Pity, and all with such concentrated
truth that his colours here seem dissolved in tears that drop and drop,
however softly, through all time. Of this single yearning consciousness
the figures are admirably expressive. No later painter learned to render
with deeper force than Fra Angelico the one state of the spirit he could
conceive--a passionate pious tenderness. Immured in his quiet convent,
he apparently never received an intelligible impression of evil; and his
conception of human life was a perpetual sense of sacredly loving
and being loved. But how, immured in his quiet convent, away from the
streets and the studios, did he become that genuine, finished, perfectly
professional painter? No one is less of a mere mawkish amateur. His
range was broad, from this really heroic fresco to the little trumpeting
seraphs, in their opaline robes, enamelled, as it were, on the gold
margins of his pictures.

I sat out the sermon and departed, I hope, with the gentle preacher’s
blessing. I went into the smaller refectory, near by, to refresh my
memory of the beautiful Last Supper of Domenico Ghirlandaio. It would be
putting things coarsely to say that I adjourned thus from a sernlon to
a comedy, though Ghirlandaio’s theme, as contrasted with the blessed
Angelico’s, was the dramatic spectacular side of human life. How keenly
he observed it and how richly he rendered it, the world about him of
colour and costume, of handsome heads and pictorial groupings! In his
admirable school there is no painter one enjoys--pace Ruskin--more
sociably and irresponsibly. Lippo Lippi is simpler, quainter,
more frankly expressive; but we retain before him a remnant of the
sympathetic discomfort provoked by the masters whose conceptions were
still a trifle too large for their means. The pictorial vision in their
minds seems to stretch and strain their undeveloped skill almost to a
sense of pain. In Ghirlandaio the skill and the imagination are equal,
and he gives us a delightful impression of enjoying his own resources.
Of all the painters of his time he affects us least as positively not
of ours. He enjoyed a crimson mantle spreading and tumbling in curious
folds and embroidered with needlework of gold, just as he enjoyed a
handsome well-rounded head, with vigorous dusky locks, profiled in
courteous adoration. He enjoyed in short the various reality of things,
and had the good fortune to live in an age when reality flowered into a
thousand amusing graces--to speak only of those. He was not especially
addicted to giving spiritual hints; and yet how hard and meagre they
seem, the professed and finished realists of our own day, with the
spiritual bonhomie or candour that makes half Ghirlandaio’s richness
left out! The Last Supper at San Marco is an excellent example of the
natural reverence of an artist of that time with whom reverence was
not, as one may say, a specialty. The main idea with him has been the
variety, the material bravery and positively social charm of the
scene, which finds expression, with irrepressible generosity, in the
accessories of the background. Instinctively he imagines an opulent
garden--imagines it with a good faith which quite tides him over the
reflection that Christ and his disciples were poor men and unused to sit
at meat in palaces. Great full-fruited orange-trees peep over the wall
before which the table is spread, strange birds fly through the air,
while a peacock perches on the edge of the partition and looks down
on the sacred repast. It is striking that, without any at all intense
religious purpose, the figures, in their varied naturalness, have a
dignity and sweetness of attitude that admits of numberless reverential
constructions. I should call all this the happy tact of a robust faith.

On the staircase leading up to the little painted cells of the Beato
Angelico, however, I suddenly faltered and paused. Somehow I had grown
averse to the intenser zeal of the Monk of Fiesole. I wanted no more of
him that day. I wanted no more macerated friars and spear-gashed sides.
Ghirlandaio’s elegant way of telling his story had put me in the humour
for something more largely intelligent, more profanely pleasing.
I departed, walked across the square, and found it in the Academy,
standing in a particular spot and looking up at a particular high-hung
picture. It is difficult to speak adequately, perhaps even intelligibly,
of Sandro Botticelli. An accomplished critic--Mr. Pater, in his Studies
on the History of the Renaissance--has lately paid him the tribute
of an exquisite, a supreme, curiosity. He was rarity and distinction
incarnate, and of all the multitudinous masters of his group
incomparably the most interesting, the one who detains and perplexes
and fascinates us most. Exquisitely fine his imagination--infinitely
audacious and adventurous his fancy. Alone among the painters of his
time he strikes us as having invention. The glow and thrill of expanding
observation--this was the feeling that sent his comrades to their
easels; but Botticelli’s moved him to reactions and emotions of which
they knew nothing, caused his faculty to sport and wander and explore
on its own account. These impulses have fruits often so ingenious and so
lovely that it would be easy to talk nonsense about them. I hope it is
not nonsense, however, to say that the picture to which I just alluded
(the “Coronation of the Virgin,” with a group of life-sized saints
below and a garland of miniature angels above) is one of the supremely
beautiful productions of the human mind. It is hung so high that
you need a good glass to see it; to say nothing of the unprecedented
delicacy of the work. The lower half is of moderate interest; but the
dance of hand-clasped angels round the heavenly couple above has a
beauty newly exhaled from the deepest sources of inspiration. Their
perfect little hands are locked with ineffable elegance; their blowing
robes are tossed into folds of which each line is a study; their
charming feet have the relief of the most delicate sculpture. But, as
I have already noted, of Botticelli there is much, too much to
say--besides which Mr. Pater has said all. Only add thus to his
inimitable grace of design that the exquisite pictorial force driving
him goes a-Maying not on wanton errands of its own, but on those of some
mystic superstition which trembles for ever in his heart.

The more I look at the old Florentine domestic architecture the more I
like it--that of the great examples at least; and if I ever am able to
build myself a lordly pleasure-house I don’t see how in conscience I can
build it different from these. They are sombre and frowning, and look
a trifle more as if they were meant to keep people out than to let
them in; but what equally “important” type--if there be an equally
important--is more expressive of domiciliary dignity and security and
yet attests them with a finer æesthetic economy? They are impressively
“handsome,” and yet contrive to be so by the simplest means. I don’t say
at the smallest pecuniary cost--that’s another matter. There is money
buried in the thick walls and diffused through the echoing excess of
space. The merchant nobles of the fifteenth century had deep and full
pockets, I suppose, though the present bearers of their names are glad
to let out their palaces in suites of apartments which are occupied by
the commercial aristocracy of another republic. One is told of fine old
mouldering chambers of which possession is to be enjoyed for a sum not
worth mentioning. I am afraid that behind these so gravely harmonious
fronts there is a good deal of dusky discomfort, and I speak now simply
of the large serious faces themselves as you can see them from the
street; see them ranged cheek to cheek, in the grey historic light of
Via dei Bardi, Via Maggio, Via degli Albizzi. The force of character,
the familiar severity and majesty, depend on a few simple features: on
the great iron-caged windows of the rough-hewn basement; on the noble
stretch of space between the summit of one high, round-topped window
and the bottom of that above; on the high-hung sculptured shield at the
angle of the house; on the flat far-projecting roof; and, finally, on
the magnificent tallness of the whole building, which so dwarfs our
modern attempts at size. The finest of these Florentine palaces are, I
imagine, the tallest habitations in Europe that are frankly and
amply habitations--not mere shafts for machinery of the American
grain-elevator pattern. Some of the creations of M. Haussmann in Paris
may climb very nearly as high; but there is all the difference in the
world between the impressiveness of a building which takes breath, as
it were, some six or seven times, from storey to storey, and of one that
erects itself to an equal height in three long-drawn pulsations. When
a house is ten windows wide and the drawing-room floor is as high as a
chapel it can afford but three floors. The spaciousness of some of those
ancient drawing-rooms is that of a Russian steppe. The “family circle,”
 gathered anywhere within speaking distance, must resemble a group of
pilgrims encamped in the desert on a little oasis of carpet. Madame
Gryzanowska, living at the top of a house in that dusky, tortuous old
Borgo Pinti, initiated me the other evening most good-naturedly, lamp in
hand, into the far-spreading mysteries of her apartment. Such quarters
seem a translation into space of the old-fashioned idea of leisure.
Leisure and “room” have been passing out of our manners together, but
here and there, being of stouter structure, the latter lingers and
survives.

Here and there, indeed, in this blessed Italy, reluctantly modern in
spite alike of boasts and lamentations, it seems to have been preserved
for curiosity’s and fancy’s sake, with a vague, sweet odour of the
embalmer’s spices about it. I went the other morning to the Corsini
Palace. The proprietors obviously are great people. One of the ornaments
of Rome is their great white-faced palace in the dark Trastevere and
its voluminous gallery, none the less delectable for the poorness of
the pictures. Here they have a palace on the Arno, with another large,
handsome, respectable and mainly uninteresting collection. It contains
indeed three or four fine examples of early Florentines. It was not
especially for the pictures that I went, however; and certainly not for
the pictures that I stayed. I was under the same spell as the inveterate
companion with whom I walked the other day through the beautiful private
apartments of the Pitti Palace and who said: “I suppose I care for
nature, and I know there have been times when I have thought it the
greatest pleasure in life to lie under a tree and gaze away at blue
hills. But just now I had rather lie on that faded sea-green satin sofa
and gaze down through the open door at that retreating vista of gilded,
deserted, haunted chambers. In other words I prefer a good ‘interior’
to a good landscape. The impression has a greater intensity--the thing
itself a more complex animation. I like fine old rooms that have been
occupied in a fine old way. I like the musty upholstery, the antiquated
knick-knacks, the view out of the tall deep-embrasured windows at garden
cypresses rocking against a grey sky. If you don’t know why, I’m afraid
I can’t tell you.” It seemed to me at the Palazzo Corsini that I did
