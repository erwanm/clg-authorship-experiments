 

vague, dazzling presence, an irradiation of light from objects 
undefined, mixed with the atmosphere of Paris and of 
Venice. He presently added that a hundred things Muni- 
ment had told him about the foul horrors of the worst 
districts of London, pictures of incredible shame and suffer- 
ing that he had put before him, came back to him now, 
with the memory of the passion they had kindled at the 
time. 

' Oh, I don't want you to go by what I have told you ; 
I want you to go by what you have seen yourself. I re- 
member there were things you told me that weren't bad in 
their way.' And at this Paul Muniment sprang to his feet, 
as if their conversation had drawn to an end, or they must 
at all events be thinking of their homeward way. Hyacinth 
got up, too, while his companion stood there. Muniment 
was looking off toward London, with a face that expressed 
all the healthy singleness of his vision. Suddenly Paul 
remarked, as if it occurred to him to complete, or at any 
rate confirm, the declaration he had made a short time 
before, 'Yes, I don't believe in the millennium, but I do 
believe in the democracy.' 

The young man, as he spoke these words, struck his 
comrade as such a fine embodiment of the spirit of the 
people ; he stood there, in his powerful, sturdy newness, 
with such an air of having learnt what he had learnt 
and of good-nature that had purposes in it, that our hero 
felt the simple inrush of his old, frequent pride at having 
a person of that promise, a nature of that capacity, for a 
friend. He passed his hand into Muniment's arm and 
said, with an imperceptible tremor in his voice, ' It's no 
use your saying I'm not to go by what you tell me. I 





would go by what you tell me, anywhere. There's no 
awkwardness to speak of. I don't know that I believe 
exactly what you believe, but I believe in you, and doesn't 
that come to the same thing ? ' 

Muniment evidently appreciated the cordiality and 
candour of this little tribute, and the way he showed it was 
by a movement of his arm, to check his companion, before 
they started to leave the spot, and by looking down at him 
with a certain anxiety of friendliness. ' I should never have 
taken you to Hoffendahl if I hadn't thought you would 
jump at the job. It was that flaring little oration of yours, 
at the club, when you floored Delancey for saying you were 
afraid, that put me up to it.' 

' I did jump at it upon my word I did ; and it was 
just what I was looking for. That's all correct ! ' said Hya- 
cinth, cheerfully, as they went forward. There was a strain 
of heroism in these words of heroism of which the sense 
was not conveyed to Muniment by a vibration in their 
interlocked arms. Hyacinth did not make the reflection 
that he was infernally literal ; he dismissed the sentimental 
problem that had bothered him; he condoned, excused, 
admired he merged himself, resting happy for the time in 
the consciousness that Paul was a grand fellow, that friend- 
ship was a purer feeling than love, and that there was an 
immense deal of affection between them. He did not even 
observe at that moment that it was preponderantly on his 
own side. 



XXXVI 

A CERTAIN Sunday in November, more than three months 
after she had gone to live in Madeira Crescent, was so im- 
portant an occasion for the Princess Casamassima that I 
must give as complete an account of it as the limits of my 
space will allow. Early in the afternoon a loud peal from 
her door-knocker came to her ear ; it had a sound of reso- 
lution, almost of defiance, which made her look up from 
her book and listen. She was sitting by the fire, alone, 
with a volume of a heavy work on Labour and Capital in 
her hand. It was not yet four o'clock, but she had had 
candles for an hour ; a dense brown fog made the daylight 
impure, without suggesting an answer to the question 
whether the scheme of nature had been to veil or to deepen 
the sabbatical dreariness. She was not tired of Madeira 
Crescent such an idea she would indignantly have repu- 
diated ; but the prospect of a visitor was rather pleasant to 
her the possibility even of his being an ambassador, or a 
cabinet minister, or another of the eminent personages with 
whom she had associated before embracing the ascetic life. 
They had not knocked at her present door hitherto in any 
great numbers, for more reasons than one ; they were out 
of town, and she had taken pains to diffuse the belief that 
she had left England. If the impression prevailed, it was 





exactly the impression she had desired ; she forgot this fact 
whenever she felt a certain surprise, even, it may be, a cer- 
tain irritation, in perceiving that people were not taking the 
way to Madeira Crescent. She was making the discovery, 
in which she had had many predecessors, that in London 
it is only too possible to hide one's self. It was very much 
in that fashion that Godfrey Sholto was in the habit of 
announcing himself, when he reappeared after the intervals 
she explictly imposed upon him ; there was a kind of art- 
lessness, for so world-worn a personage, in the point he 
made of showing that he knocked with confidence, that he 
had as good a right as any other. This afternoon she was 
ready to accept a visit from him : she was perfectly detached 
from the shallow, frivolous world in which he lived, but 
there was still a freshness in her renunciation which coveted 
reminders and enjoyed comparisons ; he would prove to her 
how right she had been to do exactly what she was doing. 
It did not occur to her that Hyacinth Robinson might be 
at her door, for it was understood between them that, 
except by special appointment, he was to come to see 
her only in the evening. She heard in the hall, when the 
servant arrived, a voice that she failed to recognise ; but in 
a moment the door of the room was thrown open and 
the name of Mr. Muniment was pronounced. It may be 
said at once that she felt great pleasure in hearing it, for 
she had both wished to see more of Hyacinth's extraordi- 
nary friend and had given him up, so little likely had it 
begun to appear that he would put himself out for her. 
She had been glad he wouldn't come, as she had told Hya- 
cinth three months before ; but now that he had come she 
was still more glad. 



 

Presently he was sitting opposite to her, on the other 
side of the fire, with his big foot crossed over his big knee, 
his large, gloved hands fumbling with each other, drawing 
and smoothing the gloves (of very red, new-looking dog- 
skin) in places, as if they hurt him. So far as the size of 
his extremities, and even his attitude and movement, went, 
he might have belonged to her former circle. With the 
details of his dress remaining vague in the lamp -light, 
which threw into relief mainly his powerful, important 
head, he might have been one of the most consider- 
able men she had ever known. The first thing she 
said to him was that she wondered extremely what had 
brought him at last to come to see her : the idea, 
when she proposed it, evidently had so little attraction 
for him. She had only seen him once since then the 
day she met him coming into Audley Court as she 
was leaving it, after a visit to his sister and, as he 
probably remembered, she had not on that occasion 
repeated her invitation. 

' It wouldn't have done any good, at the time, if you 
had,' Muniment rejoined, with his natural laugh. 

' Oh, I felt that ; my silence wasn't accidental ! ' the 
Princess exclaimed, joining in his merriment. 

' I have only come now since you have asked me the 
reason because my sister hammered at me, week after 
week, dinning it into me that I ought to. Oh, I've been 
under the lash ! If she had left me alone I wouldn't have 
come.' 

The Princess blushed on hearing these words, but not 
with shame or with pain ; rather with the happy excitement 
of being spoken to in a manner so fresh and original. She 





had never before had a visitor who practised so racy a 
frankness, or who, indeed, had so curious a story to tell. 
She had never before so completely failed, and her failure 
greatly interested her, especially as it seemed now to be 
turning a little to success. She had succeeded promptly 
with every one, and the sign of it was that every one had 
rendered her a monotony of homage. Even poor little 
Hyacinth had tried, in the beginning, to say sweet things 
to her. This very different type of man appeared to have 
his thoughts fixed on anything but sweetness ; she felt the 
liveliest hope that he would move further and further away 
from it. ' I remember what you asked me what good it 
would do you. I couldn't tell you then ; and though I now 
have had a long time to turn it over, I haven't thought of 
it yet.' 

'Oh, but I hope it will do me some,' said Paul. 'A 
fellow wants a reward, when he has made a great effort.' 

' It does me some,' the Princess remarked, gaily. 

' Naturally, the awkward things I say amuse you. But 
I don't say them for that, but just to give you an 
idea. 3 

' You give me a great many ideas. Besides, I know you 
already a good deal.' 

' From little Robinson, I suppose,' said Muniment. 

The Princess hesitated. ' More particularly from Lady 
Aurora.' 

' Oh, she doesn't know much about me ! ' the young man 
exclaimed. 

' It's a pity you say that, because she likes you.' 

( Yes, she likes me,' Muniment replied, serenely. 

Again the Princess hesitated. ' And I hope you like her.' 



  4? 



' Ay, she's a dear old girl ! ' 

The Princess reflected that her visitor was not a gentle- 
man, like Hyacinth ; but this made no difference in her 
present attitude. The expectation that he would be a 
gentleman had had nothing to do with her interest in 
him ; that, in fact, had rested largely on the supposition 
that he had a rich plebeian strain. 'I don't know that 
there is any one in the world I envy so much,' she 
remarked; an observation which her visitor received in 
silence. ' Better than any one I have ever met she has 
solved the problem which, if we are wise, we all try 
to solve, don't we? of getting out of herself. She has 
got out of herself more perfectly than any one I have 
ever known. She has merged herself in the passion of 
doing something for others. That's why I envy her,' 
said the Princess, with an explanatory smile, as if per- 
haps he didn't understand her. ' 

'It's an amusement, like any other,' said Paul Muni- 
ment. 

' Ah, not like any other ! It carries light into dark 
places ; it makes a great many wretched people con- 
siderably less wretched.' 

'How many, eh?' asked the young man, not exactly 
as if he wished to dispute, but as if it were always in 
him to enjoy an argument. 

The Princess wondered why he should desire to argue 
at Lady Aurora's expense. ' Well, one who is very near 
to you, to begin with.' 

' Oh, she's kind, most kind ; it's altogether wonderful. 
But Rosy makes her considerably less wretched,' Paul 
Muniment rejoined. 





' Very likely, of course ; and so she does me.' 
' May I inquire what you are wretched about ? ' Muni- 
ment went on. 

'About nothing at all. That's the worst of it. But 
I am much happier now than I have ever been.' 
' Is that also about nothing ?' 

' No, about a sort of change that has taken place in 
my life. I have been able to do some little things.' 

' For the poor, I suppose you mean. Do you refer 
to the presents you have made to Rosy ? ' the young man 
inquired. 

' The presents ? ' The Princess appeared not to re- 
member. ' Oh, those are trifles. It isn't anything one 
has been able to give ; it's some talks one has had, some 
convictions one has arrived at.' 

'Convictions are a source of very innocent pleasure,' 
said the young man, smiling at his interlocutress with his 
bold, pleasant eyes, which seemed to project their glance 
further than any she had seen. 

'Having them is nothing. It's the acting on them,' 
the Princess replied. 

' Yes ; that doubtless, too, is good.' He continued to 
look at her peacefully, as if he liked to consider that this 
might be what she had asked him to come for. He said 
nothing more, and she went on : 

' It's far better, of course, when one is a man.' 
' I don't know. Women do pretty well what they like. 
My sister and you have managed, between you, to bring me 
to this.' 

'It's more your sister, I suspect, than I. But why, 
after all, should you have disliked so much to come ? ' 






 

' Well, since you ask me,' said Paul Muniment, ' I will 
tell you frankly, though I don't mean it uncivilly, that 
I don't know what to make of you.' 

' Most people don't,' returned the Princess. ' But they 
usually take the risk.' 

' Ah, well, I'm the most prudent of men.' 

' I was sure of it ; that is one of the reasons why I 
wanted to know you. I know what some of your ideas are 
Hyacinth Robinson has told me ; and the source of my 
interest in them is partly the fact that you consider very 
carefully what you attempt.' 

' That I do I do,' said Muniment, simply. 

The tone in which he said this would have been almost 
ignoble, as regards a kind of northern canniness which it 
expressed, had it not been corrected by the character of his 
face, his youth and strength, and his military eye. The 
Princess recognised both the shrewdness and the latent 
audacity as she rejoined, ' To do anything with you would 
be very safe. It would be sure to succeed.' 

' That's what poor Hyacinth thinks,' said Paul Muni- 
ment. 

The Princess wondered a little that he could allude in 
that light tone to the faith their young friend had placed in 
him, considering the consequences such a trustfulness 
might yet have ; but this curious mixture of qualities could 
only make her visitor, as a tribune of the people, more 
interesting to her. She abstained for the moment from 
touching on the subject of Hyacinth's peculiar position, and 
only said, 'Hasn't he told you about me? Hasn't he 
explained me a little ? ' 

' Oh, his explanations are grand ! ' Muniment ex- 


claimed, hilariously. ' He's fine sport when he talks 
about you.' 

'Don't betray him,' said the Princess, gently. 

' There's nothing to betray. You would be the first to 
admire it if you were there. Besides, I don't betray,' the 
young man added. 

' I love him very much,' said the Princess ; and it would 
have been impossible for the most impudent cynic to smile 
at the manner in which she made the declaration. 

Paul accepted it respectfully. ' He's a sweet little lad, 
and, putting her ladyship aside, quite the light of our 
home.' 

There was a short pause after this exchange of amenities, 
which the Princess terminated by inquiring, ' Wouldn't some 
one else do his work quite as well ? ' 

' His work ? Why, I'm told he's a master-hand.' 

'Oh, I don't mean his bookbinding.' Then the Princess 
added, ' I don't know whether you know it, but I am in 
correspondence with Hoffendahl. I am acquainted with 
many of our most important men.' 

' Yes, I know it. Hyacinth has told me. Do you 
mention it as a guarantee, so that I may know you are 
genuine ? ' 

'Not exactly; that would be weak, wouldn't it?' the 
Princess asked. ' My genuineness must be in myself a 
matter for you to appreciate as you know me better ; not in 
my references and vouchers.' 

' I shall never know you better. What business is it of 
mine ? ' 

' I want to help you,' said the Princess, and as she made
