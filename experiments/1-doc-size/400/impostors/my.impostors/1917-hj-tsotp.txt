by hearsay, imputed to the beauty and sincerity 
of the portrayed, the attentive donatorio in the 
corner of the Venetian or other masterpiece. 
What was the presence of the pious magnifico, 
say, but our very Ralph Pendrel's presence, not 
a little mixed, as he supposed that of the old-time 
devotee represented in the act to be, with the 
immemorial smoke of altar candles ? yet leaving 
the upper spaces, those where the sacred or the 
saintly image itself reigned, clear and sublime. 
The clearness, or call it even the sublimity, was 
here for all the world the same sort of thing: 
didn't it place round the handsome uplifted head, 
as by the patina of the years, the soft rub of the 
finger of time, that ring of mystic light ? In the 
Titian, the Tintoret or the Veronese such a melting 
of the tone, such a magic as grew and grew 
for Ralph as soon as he once had caught the 
fancy of it, would have expressed the supernatural 
even as the circling nimbus expresses. 

He had at intervals an eye to his watch, but 
what kept him on and on was precisely the force 
of the stillness in which nothing happened. There 
had come to him at the end of an hour or two 
a special and peculiar sense of being alone in 
the house. If his good friends in charge were 
below he had had with them this evening no 
contact never were good friends so respectful of 
what he was quite ready to call for their sake his 
absurdity. He was fully aware of how absurd 
it might appear in a quiet gentleman of unan 
nounced intentions to perambulate an ordered 
house after the fashion of some carpet-man or 
plumber deprived by a catastrophe of foot-rule 
or pocket-book. He listened at the mouth of 
the lower regions and found them soundless; he 
remounted to the chambers above, and then he 
again descended to apply that test. Practically, 
in any case, he was beyond all observation and 
if self-effaced agents but worked to make him 
feel so, that only assured the freedom. Perhaps 
they had in fact gone out, finding him in mur 
mured counsel more uncanny than they liked; 
it came to him whimsically while he paused anew 
at one of the windows as if on purpose to feel 
cut off by the gathering night and the patter of 
cold rain, it came to him agreeably that they 
might have been scared of a person whose range 
was so restless, who, declining at the outset a 
fire, seemed to like the gruesome chill, and who 
now let the shadows multiply without so much 
as ringing for a light. 

The windy lanterns flickered in the square and 
were reflected in the wet, and as he turned about 
for another prowl his last decidedly this one 
he assured himself that he had in his pocket 
matches for tobacco and that, should he require 
them, the numerous brave stiff candle-sticks of 
silver and brass (oh what people he knew, even 
Aurora herself, would have given for them !) 
were furnished with tall tapers. On his reaching 
again for his final round the first drawing-room, 
which occupied with its fine windows the width 
of the house and into which, as the curtains were 
still undrawn, the street-lamp before the outer 
door played up with a gusty rise and fall that 
made objects, chairs, cabinets, sofas, pictures, 
look the least bit equivocal and like some vague 
human company that blinked or grimaced at him 
on his thus finding himself once more where he 
seemed most to hold the key of the place he re 
sumed the pointless pacing that had occupied so 
much of his visit. He walked from end to end 
as with a problem to think out; listened to his 
tread on the carpetless floor, for the perfect polish 
of which (no material note in the whole scale 
being more to his taste) he had made from the 
first a point of commending the housekeeper; 
he stayed on without knowing why, only clinging 
to this particular room just because he could 
measure its length, and even a little because of 
the very ambiguity, half sociable and half sinister, 
that made its different features, as he might have 
said, take action. He trifled at moments with 
the idea of spending the night which he was in 
deed spending to the extent that he so hung on. 
Nights spent in peculiar houses were a favourite 
theme of the magazines, and he remembered tales 
about them that had been thought clever only 
regretting now that he had not heard on the re 
treat of his fellow-occupants (for was not that 
always the indispensable stroke ?) the terrified 
bang of the door. The real deterrent to sitting 
up at Number Nine would just be, he lucidly 
reasoned, its coincidence with the magazines. 
Nothing would induce him, he could at least 
fondly convince himself, to make the place the 
subject of one of the vulgar experiments that 
pass into current chatter. He would presently 
go with his mind made up; but meanwhile he 
walked. 

He walked and walked walked till he received 
a check in the form of a bump from a piece of 
furniture. This brought him back to the fact of 
the complete fall of night and to more darkness 
in the room than his enlarged vision had for the 





  

time needed to reckon with. He looked about 
him and felt as cold as if he had really passed a 
vigil; without his certainty that he had been on 
his legs he might fairly believe he had slept. He 
wondered what time had elapsed, but, taking out 
his watch to see, found its face indistinct even 
at the window. He then felt in his waistcoat for 
matches, but immediately after, in the act of 
striking one, had a happy change of thought. 
It was as if he had already proof positive of being 
there alone. It was vivid to him at this instant, 
in the flame of his match, that for reasons he 
didn't stop to question the fact itself made so 
for intenser moments he had been peculiarly 
disconnected and left, left to himself and to what 
ever else might be; with which consciousness he 
instead of consulting his watch, though he took 
another look about, made for the first candle 
stick that just showed its upright silver gleam. 
His match went out before he reached it, but he 
struck another, and it was in the act of lighting 
the candle that his hand told him how he 
trembled. This was the shake, he felt, however, 
of excitement not of a baser state of nerves; 
an excitement that marked simply his at last 
knowing himself, as not yet, in possession of 
what he had come in for. His doubt was settled : 
he had asked himself if he were prepared, if he 
should "elect," to be; but here he was, in fine, 
without more question or more ado. The only 





  

ado was, with his candle lighted, to face the con 
sequence of that particular preparation. 

This act employed him, thanks to the bunchy 
wick, a minute or two; but no sooner was the 
little flame assured and he had raised aloft the 
glimmering torch than he was filled with the 
sense of a quite new relation to the house. It 
was but a trifle, yet he had not hitherto so much 
used the place even as to light a candle. This 
triviality made all the difference of raising him 
from the condition, comparatively poor, of a 
visitor who betrayed timidity. It registered in 
a single brief insistence the fact that he was 
master, and when he now almost waved in the 
air his light, of which the wax hadn't time to 
melt, it was in sign tremble though his hand 
still might of a confidence sharply gained. The 
impression was strong with him of having 
traversed a crisis served, and all in half an 
hour, one of those concentrated terms of pious 
self-dedication or whatever by which the aspirants 
of the ages of faith used to earn their knighthood. 
What was it he had emerged from after this 
fashion of the accepted probationer? He had 
had his idea of testing the house, and lo it was 
the house that by a turn of the tables had tested 
him. He had at all events grasped his candle 
as if it had been sword or cross, and his attitude 
may pass for us as sufficiently his answer or his 
vow. It had already occurred to him that, so 





  

completely consecrated, he must make one more 
round. He moved to the end of the room and 
then moved back; it had begun to give him ex 
traordinary pleasure thus to march with his 
light. He marched out to the lobby and the 
staircase and then down, slow and solemn, to the 
hall he had supposed Jacobean and in which, 
illumined, he could once more, by the mere play 
of his arm, make due amends for his mistake. 
He came up again to the landing by the great 
room and, after a slight hesitation, continued his 
ascent. He revolved through the chambers above 
and amused himself, at successive windows, with 
the thought of the observation possibly incurred, 
out in the square, by such a wandering twinkle 
from floor to floor and in the small hours on the 
part of some soaked and sleepy policeman not 
already, ^in respect to the old house, without a 
working hypothesis. On his return to the level 
of the drawing rooms he had another of his pauses; 
he stood with his candle aloft and his eyes at 
tached a minute to the door that, open at the 
end of the passage, would have admitted him 
straight to the panelled parlour. 

The effect of this consideration was that he 
went roundabout, turning directly again to the 
front and the row of dark windows lashed afresh 
by a great gust of the rain. It was as if the wind 
had of a sudden grown wild in order to emphasise 
with its violence all the elements of his case. It 





  

was somehow too by this time with such a stride 
two o'clock in the morning and terrible weather. 
The forward exposure most met the assault, the 
small square black panes rattled in their tall 
white sashes, the objects around him creaked, 
and his candle came as near going out as if a 
window had blown through. The commotion was 
in fact so great, shaking all the place, that under 
the sense of the draught he wasn't for the mo 
ment sure something hadn't somewhere been 
forced open. He instinctively moved, half for 
inquiry, half for shelter, to the inner room, the 
second; which brought him, still with his clutched 
and raised light, to view of the other door of the 
panelled parlour, the access independent of the 
hall. He had after this an instant of confusion, 
an instant during which he struck himself as 
catching at a distance the chance reflection of 
his candle-flame on some polished surface. If the 
flame was there, however, where was the surface ? 
the duplication of his light showing, he quickly 
perceived, in the doorway itself. He received in 
those instants an amazing impression knew him 
self convinced that in his absence the thing he 
had thought of and put away had taken place. 
Somebody was in the room more prodigiously 
still than he had dreamed on his level, on the 
floor itself and but ten yards off, and now, all 
intelligence and response, vividly aware of him, 
fixed him across the space with eyes of life. It 


across the space will) eyes of life. It was like the 
miracle prayed for in the church the figure in 
the picture had turned ; but from the moment it 
had done so this tremendous action, this descent, 
tin's advance, an advance, and as for recognition, 
upon his so!iu,;.y <x;1f, hnd almost the effect ul ^ r st 
of crushing recognition, in other words of crushing 
presumption, by their immeasurable weight. The 
huge strangeness, that of a gentleman there, a 
gentleman from head to foot, to meet him and 
share his disconnection, stopped everything ; yet 
it was in nothing stranger than in the association 
that they already, they unmistakcably felt they 
had enjoyed. With this last apprehension at any 
rate the full prodigy was there, for what he most 
sharply knew while he turned colder still was 
that what he had taken for a reflection of his light 
was only another candle. He knew, though out 
of his eye's range any assurance, that the second 
of the pair on the shelf below the portrait was now 
not in its place. He raised his own still higher 
to be sure, and the j r oung man in the doorway 
made a movement that answered ; but so, while 
almost as with brandished weapons they faced 
each other, he saw what was indeed beyond sense. 
He was staring at the answer to the riddle that 
had been his obsession, but this answer was a 
wonder of wonders. The 3 r oung man above the 
mantel, the young man brown-haired, pale, erect, 
with the high-collared dark blue coat, the young 
man revealed, responsible, conscious, quite shining 
out of the darkness, presented him the face he 
had prayed to reward his vigil ; but the face- 
miracle of miracles, yes confounded him as his 
own. 



BOOK THIRD 

THE upshot of the state in which he found him 
self for three or four days was a sudden decision 
to call on the Ambassador. The idea, in coming 
to him, brought him ease, offered an issue to his 
pressing need to communicate. He had been 
divided between this need and the equal one 
the profound policy of silence; than which con 
flict nothing in his life had ever more tormented 
him. He wished he had been a Catholic, that 
he might go to confession; his desire, remarkably 
enough, being no less for secrecy than for relief. 
He recalled the chapter in Hawthorne's fine novel 
in which the young woman from New England 
kneels, for the lightening of her woe, to the old 
priest at St. Peter's, and felt that he sounded as 
never before the depth of that passage. His case 
in truth was worse than Hilda's and his burden 
much greater, for she had been but a spectator 
of what weighed upon her, whereas he had been 
a close participant. It mattered little enough 
that his sense was not the sense of crime; it was 
the sense, in an extraordinary degree, of some 
thing done in passion, and of an experience far 
stranger than a mere glimpse, or than, if it came 
to that, a positive perpetration, of murder. He 
wondered that a knowledge of anything less than 





  

murder could be able to constitute in one's soul 
such a closed back room; but what was of course 
now most present to him was that he had hitherto 
grasped of life a sadly insignificant shred. There 
were at least as many more things in it for one's 
philosophy than poor Hamlet himself was to have 
found in heaven and earth. He went about and 
took his food and did his business; he had tested 
the truth of the promise made, the promise that 
he should successively present, even to himself, 
on reappearance; he was in fact fully aware that 
he had never yet had for the world yes, and 
perhaps too for himself so much to rest on as 
in the appearance he presented. 

Nothing perhaps was more strange than that 
what he had accepted he still accepted; he was 
not attended with disorders or fears; he had 
neither alarms nor lapses nor returns, neither 
cold sweats nor hot flushes: it was much nearer 
true that he found in the excitement for it was 
after all, however muffled and compressed, the 
felt throb of a pulse an inordinate charm. But 
if it might be a charm, for the time, as much as 
one would, just so it might become later on, and 
was probably sure to, a terror; whatever form 
one should finally best know it by, he wanted 
in some single instance to impart his knowledge. 
He desired, he chose, that one other person, 
anxiously selected, should share his charge of it. 
One person would do in fact more than one 





  

would spoil everything. There was a difference 
for him that he conceived this would make if he 
could only be sure of the safety of the vessel. 
His word once dropped into that moral receptacle 
and the key turned upon it and pocketed, he 
should come the more assuredly back to life, or 
might rather, and as for the first time, attack and 
perhaps surmount it. The motive he obeyed 
was indeed on the occasion of the visit itself as 
completely expressed as might be. The Am 
bassador, blest and distinguished man, was not 
a personal friend, was only the friend of friends. 
These latter had so taken the field that Ralph 
was more "introduced" than he had ever been 
to anyone, or than his Excellency could ever 
have known any bearer of letters. Such, how 
ever, was the high urbanity of this personage 
that our young man was as well received as if 
the heralds had been dumb. To the blare of 
trumpets Ralph had moreover not himself con 
tributed, leaving his letters at the Embassy as 
little as elsewhere: he only knew that suggestion 
would have been applied from over the sea with 
out action of his own, and this in fact put further 
delay at odds with good manners. It was suf 
ficient that the representative of his country 
should be pre-eminent, accomplished, witty and 
kind, and that, much addicted to good cigars, he
