"Wonderfully — but just so that it does build her out.  
She's bricked up, she's buried alive ! " 

Strether seemed for a moment to look at it ; but it 
brought him to a sigh. " Oh, but she's not dead ! It will 1 
take more than this to kill her." 

His companion had a pause that might have been 
for pity. " No, I can't pretend I think she's finished — - 
or that it's for more than to-night." She remained pen- 
sive as if with the same compunction. " It's only up to 
her chin." Then again for the fun of it: "She can still 
breathe." 

" She can still breathe ! " — he echoed it in the same   
spirit. " And do you know," he went on, " what's really, li 
all this time, happening to me? — through the beauty of , 
music, the gaiety of voices, the uproar, in short, of our 
revel and the felicity of your wit ? The sound of Mrs. 
Pocock's respiration drowns for me, I assure you, every 
other. It's literally all I hear." 

She focussed him with her clink of chains. " Well 1" 

she breathed ever so kindly. 

"Well, what?" 

" She is free from her chin up," she mused ; " and that 
wt7/ be enough for her." , 

" It will be enough for me ! " Strether ruefully laughed. 1 
" Waymarsh has. really," he then asked, " brought her to 
see you ? "  

"Yes — but that's the worst of it. I could do you no 
good. And yet I tried hard." 

Strether wondered. " And how did you try ? "   

"Why, I didn't speak of you."   

" I see. That was better." ' 

" Then what would have been worse ? For speaking or 
silent," she lightly wailed, " I somehow ' compromise.' And   
it has never been anyone but you." 

"That shows" — he was magnanimous — " that it's some- 
thing not in you, but in one's self. It's viy fault." I 

She was silent a little. " No, it's Mr. Waymarsh's. It's 
the fault of his having brought her." 

" Ah then," said Strether good-naturedly, " why diJ 
he bring her ? " 

" He couldn't afford not to." 





" Oh, you were a trophy — one of the spoils of conquest ? 
But why, io that case, since you do ' compromise ' " 

" Don't I compromise liivi as well ? I do compromise 
him as well," Miss Barrace smiled. " I compromise him 
as hard as I can. But for Mr. VVaymarsh it isn't fatal. 
It's — so far as his wonderful relation with Mrs. Pocock 
is concerned — favourable." And then as he still seemed 
slightly at sea : " The man who had succeeded with mcy 
don't you see ? For her to get him from me was such an 
added incentive." 

Strether saw, but as if his path was still strewn with 
surprises. "It's ' from ' you then that she has got him ? " 

She was amused at his momentary muddle. " You can 
fancy my fight ! She believes in her triumph. I think it 
has been part of her joy." 

" Oh, her joy ! " Strether sceptically murmured. 

" Well, she thinks she has had her own way. And what 
is to-night, for her, but a kind of apotheosis ? Her frock's 
really good." 

" Good enough to go to heaven in ? For after a real 
apotheosis," Strether went on, " there's nothing but heaven. 
For Sarah there's only to-morrow." 

" And you mean that she won't find to-morrow heavenly? " 

" Well, I mean that I somehow feel to-night — on her 
behalf — too good to be true. She has had her cake ; that 
is she's in the act now of having it, of swallowing the 
largest and sweetest piece. There won't be another left 
for her. Certainly / haven't one. It can only, at the 
best, be Chad." He continued to make it out as for their 
common entertainment. " He may have one, as it were, 
up his sleeve ; yet it's borne in upon me that if he 
had " 

" He wouldn't " — she quite understood — " have taken all 
this trouble? I dare say not, and, if I may be quite free 
and dreadful, I very much hope he won't take any more. 
Of course I won't pretend now," she added, " not to know 
what it's a question of." 

" Oh, everyone knows, I think, now," poor Strether 
thoughtfully admitted; "and it's .strange enough and funny 
enough that one should feel everybody here at this very 
moment knowing and watching and waiting." 





" Yes — isn't it indeed funny ? " Miss Barrace quite rose 

to it. " That's the way we are in Paris," She was always   

pleased with a new contribution to that queerness. " It's  

wonderful ! But, you know," she declared, " it all de-

pends on you. I don't want to turn the knife in your  

vitals, but that's naturally what you just now meant  

by our all being on top of you. We know you as the 

hero of the drama, and we're gathered to see what you'll  
do." 

Strether looked at her a moment with a light perhaps   

slightly obscured. " I think that must be why the hero   

has taken refuge in this corner. He's scared at his heroism 8 

— he shrinks from his part." ' 

" Ah, but we nevertheless believe that he'll play it. 
That's why," Miss Barrace kindly went on, "we take such 
an interest in you. We feel that you'll come up to the 
scratch." And then as he seemed perhaps not quite to 
take fire : " Don't let him do it." 

" Don't let Chad go ? " 

"Yes, keep hold of him. With all this" — and she 
indicated the general tribute — " he has done enough. We 
love him here — he's charming." 

" It's beautiful," said Strether, " the way you all can 

simplify when you will."  

But she gave it him back. " It's nothing to the way ' w 

will when you must." 

He winced at it as at the very voice of prophecy, and it ' 

kept him a moment quiet. He detained her, however, on I 

her appearing about to leave him alone in the rather cold ; 

clearance their talk had made. " There positively isn't ' 

a sign of a hero to-night ; the hero's dodging and shirking,   

the hero's ashamed. Therefore, you know, I think, what 

you must all really be occupied with is the heroine." ; 

Miss Barrace took a minute. " The heroine ? " ' 

" The heroine. I've treated her," said Strether, " not 
a bit like a hero. Oh," he sighed, " I don't do it well ! " 

She eased him off. " You do it as you can." And then 
after another hesitation : '  I think she's satisfied." 

But he remained compunctious. " I haven't been near 
her. I haven't looked at her." 

" Ah then, you've lost a good deal ! "  





He showed that he knew it. " She's more wonderful 
than ever ? " 

" Than ever. With Mr. Pocock." 

Strether wondered. " Mme. de Vionnet — with Jim ? " 

" Mme. de Vionnet — with 'Jim.'" Miss Barrace was 
historic. 

" And what is she doing with him ? " 

" Ah, you must ask ///;;/ / " 

Strether's face h"ghted again at the prospect. "It ivill 
be amusing to do so." Yet he continued to wonder. "But 
she must have some idea." 

" Of course she has — she has twenty ideas. She has, in the 
first place," said Miss Barrace, swinging a little her tortoise- 
shell, "that of doing her part. Her part is to help' w." 

It came out as nothing had come yet ; links were miss- 
ing and connections unnamed, but it was suddenly as if 
they were at the heart of their subject. "Yes ; how much 
more she does it," Strether gravely reflected, "than I 
help her !" It all came over him as with the near presence 
of the beauty, the grace, the intense, dissimulated spirit 
with which he had, as he said, been putting off contact. 
" She has courage." 

" Ah, she has courage ! " Miss Barrace quite agreed ; 
and it was as if, for a moment, they saw the quantity in 
each other's face. 

But indeed the whole thing was present. " How much 
she must care ! " 

" Ah, there it is. She does care. But it isn't, is it," Miss 
Ilarrace considerately added, " as if you had ever had any 
doubt of that ? " 

Strether seemed suddenly to like to feel that he really 
never had. " Why, of course it's the whole point." 

" Voild!" Miss Barrace smiled. 

" It's why one came out," Strether went on. " And it's 
why one has stayed so long. And it's also" — he abounded 
— " why one's going home. It's why, it's why " 

"It's why everything!" she concurred. "It's why she 
might be to-night — for all she looks and shows, and for all 
your friend 'Jim' does — about twenty years old. That's 
another of her ideas ; to be, for him, and to be quite easily 
and charmingly, as young as a little girl." 





Strether assisted, at his distance. " ' For him ' ? For 
Chad ? " 

" For Chad, in a manner, naturally always. But in 
particular, to-night, for Mr. Pocock." And then, as her 
friend still stared : " Yes, it is of a bravery ! But that's 
what she has : her high sense of duty." It was more than 
sufficiently before them. "When Mr. Newsome has his 
hands so embarrassed with his sister " 

" It's quite the least "—Strether filled it out—" that she 
should take his sister's husband ? Certainly — quite the 
least. So she has taken him." 

"She has taken him." It was all Miss Barrace had 
meant. 

Still, it remained enough. " It must be funny." 

"Oh, it is funny." That, of course, essentially went 
with it. 

But it brought them back. " How indeed then she 
must care ! " In answer to which Strether's interlocutress 
dropped a comprehensive " Ah ! " which perhaps expressed 
a slight impatience at the time he took to get used to it. 
She herself had got used to it long before. 



XXVI 

When, one morning, within the week, he perceived the 
whole thing to be really at last upon him, Strether's im- 
mediate feeling was all relief. He had known, this morn- 
ing, that something was about to happen — known it, in a 
moment, by Waymarsh's manner when Waymarsh appeared 
before him during his brief consumption of coffee and a roll 
in the small, slippery salle a manger so associated now 
with rich rumination. Strether had taken there of late 
various lonely and absent-minded meals; he communed 
there, even at the end of June, with a suspected chill, the 
air of old shivers mixed with old savours, the air in which 
so many of his impressions had perversely matured ; the 
place meanwhile renewing its message to him by the very 
circumstance of his single state. He now sat there, for the 
most part, to sigh softly, while he vaguely tilted his carafe, 
over the vision of how much better Waymarsh was occu- 
pied. That was really his success, by the common measure 
— to have led his companion so on and on. He remem- 
bered how, at first, there had been scarce a squatting-place 
he could beguile him into passing ; the actual sequel to 
which, at last, was that there was scarce one that could 
arrest him in his rush. His rush— as Strether vividly and 
amusedly figured it — continued to be all with Sarah, and 
contained perhaps moreover the word of the whole enigma, 
whipped up in its fine, full-flavoured froth the very prin- 
ciple, for good or for ill, of his own, of Strether's, outlook. 
It might, after all, to the end, only be that they had united 
to save him, and indeed, so far as Waymarsh was con- 
cerned, that had to be the spring of action. Strether was 
glad, at all events, in connection with the case, that the 
saving he required was not more scant; so defined a luxury 
was it, in certain lights, just to lurk there out of the full 
glare. He had moments of quite seriously wondering 



whether Waymarsh wouldn't, in fact, thanks to old friend- I 
ship and a conceivable indulgence, make about as good   
terms for him as he might make for himself. They 
wouldn't be the same terms, of course; but they might 
have the advantage that he himself probably should be 
able to make none at all.  

He was never, in the morning, very late, but Waymarsh  
had already been out, and, after a peep into the dim re-  
fectory, he presented himself there with much less than  
usual of his large looseness. He had made sure, through 1 
the expanse of glass exposed to the court, that they would ( 
be alone ; and there was now in fact that about him that
pretty well took up the room. He was dressed in the 
garments of summer ; and, save that his white waistcoat 
was redundant and bulging, these things favoured, they 
determined his expression. He wore a straw hat such as i, 
his friend had not yet seen in Paris, and he showed a 
buttonhole freshly adorned with a magnificent rose. 
Strether read, on the instant, his story — how, astir for the 
previous hour, the sprinkled newness of the day, so pleasant, I 
at that season, in Paris, he was fairly panting with the pulse 
of adventure and had been with Mrs. Pocock, unmistakably, 
to the Marche aux Fleurs. Strether really knew in this  
vision of him a joy that was akin to envy; so reversed, as I 
he stood there,, did their old positions seem; so com- 
paratively doleful now showed, by the sharp turn of the 
wheel, the posture of the pilgrim from Woollett. He   
wondered, this pilgrim, if he had originally looked to   
Waymarsh so brave and well, so remarkably launched,   
as it was at present the latter's privilege to appear. He I 
recalled that his friend had remarked to him even at I 
Chester that his aspect belied his plea of prostration ; but I 
there certainly could not have been, for an issue, an aspect I 
less concerned than Waymarsh's with the menace of 
decay. Strether had at any rate never looked like a  
southern planter of the great days — which was the image   
picturesquely suggested by the happy relation between 
the fuliginous face and the wide panama of his visitor. 
This type, it further amused him to guess, had been, on 
Waymarsh's part, the object of Sarah's care ; he was 
convinced that her taste had not been a stranger to the 





conception and purchase of the hat, any more than her fine 
fingers had been guiltless of the bestowal of the rose. 
It came to him in the current of thought, as things so 
oddly did come, that he had never risen with the lark to 
attend a brilliant woman to the Marche aux Fleurs ; that 
could be fastened on him in connection neither with Miss 
Gostrey nor with Mme. de Vionnet; the practice of getting 
up early for adventures could indeed in no manner be 
fastened on him. It came to him in fact that just here was 
his usual case : he was forever missing things through his 
general genius for missing them, while others were forever 
picking them up through a contrary bent. And it was 
others who looked abstemious and he who looked greedy ; 
it was he, somehow, who finally paid, and it was others who 
mainly partook. Yes, he should go to the scaffold yet for 
he wouldn't know quite whom. He almost, for that matter, 
felt on the scaffold now, and really quite enjoying it. It 
worked out as because he was anxious there — it worked out 
as for this reason that Waymarsh was so blooming. It was 
his trip for health, for a change, that proved the success — 
which was just what Strether, planning and exerting him- 
self, had desired it should be. That truth already sat 
full-blown on his companion's lips ; benevolence breathed 
from them as with the warmth of active exercise, and also, 
a little, as with the bustle of haste.
