to meet us.

“Good-morning! I have come for a copy of this young lady’s book!”

If I had ever fainted, I should have swooned on the spot.

For there, in heaps and heaps upon the front counter—in bindings of
dark-blue, and purple, and crimson, and leaf-brown—lay in lordly state,
portly volumes, on the backs of which, in gleaming gold that shimmered
and shook before my incredulous vision, was stamped:

“ALONE.”

I saw, through the sudden dazzlement of the whole world about me, that
a clerk had set a chair for me. I sat down gratefully.

Mr. Morris was talking:

“Opened this morning! I sent six copies up to you. I suppose you got
them?”

“No!” I tried so hard to say it firmly that it sounded careless. I
would have added, “I did not know it was out,” but dared not attempt a
sentence.

Mr. Morris attended us to the door to point to placards a porter was
tacking to boards put there for that express purpose:

                  JUST OUT!!
                    ALONE!
               By Marion Harland

The doctor nodded satisfiedly and handed me into the carriage. In
taking my seat, I thought, in a dull, sick way, of Bruce at the source
of the Nile. I had had day-dreams of this day and hour a thousand times
in the last ten years. Of how I should walk down-town some day, and see
a placard at this very door bearing the title of a novel written and
bound, and lettered in gilt, and PUBLISHED! bearing my pen-name! The
vision was a reality; the dream was a triumphant fulfilment. And I was
sitting, unchanged, and non-appreciative, by the dear old doctor, and
his full, cordial tones were saying of the portly purple volume lying
on the seat between us:

“Well, my dear child, I congratulate you, and I hope a second edition
will be called for within six months!”

He did not ply me with questions. He may not have suspected that the
shock had numbed my ideas and stiffened my tongue. If he had, he could
not have borne himself more tactfully. He was a man who had seen the
world and hobnobbed with really distinguished live authors. It would
not have been possible for him to enter fully into what this day was
to me. When I thought of Bruce and the Nile, it was because I did not
comprehend that the very magnitude of the crisis was what deprived me
of the power of appreciating what had happened.

No! I am not inclined to ridicule the unsophisticated girl whose
emotions were too mighty for speech that May noon, and to minimize what
excited them. Nothing that wealth or fame could ever offer me in years
to come could stir the depths of heart and mind as they were upheaved
in that supreme hour.

The parcel of books had been opened and the contents examined, by the
time I got home. I stole past the open door of my mother’s chamber,
where she and Aunt Rice, who was visiting us, and Mea were chatting
vivaciously, and betook myself to my room.

When my sister looked me up at dinner-time I told her to excuse me from
coming down. “The heat had made me giddy and headachy.”

She bade me “lie still. She would send me a cup of tea.”

“I’ll leave you this for company,” she cooed, laying the book tenderly
on my pillow. “We think it beautiful.”

With that she went out softly, shutting me in with my “beautiful”
first-born. Mea always had her wits within easy call. The sixth sense
was born within her.

I saw of the travail of my soul and was satisfied; was repaid a
thousandfold for months of toil and years of waiting, when my father
read my book. He did not go down-town again that day, after coming
home to dinner. My mother told me, with a happy break in her laugh,
how he had hardly touched the food on his plate. Aunt Rice’s pleasant
prattle saved the situation from awkwardness when he lapsed into a
brown study and talked less than he ate. When dessert was brought in,
he excused himself and disappeared from general view for the rest of
the afternoon. The door of “the chamber” to which he withdrew was fast
shut. Nobody disturbed him until it was too dark to read by daylight.
My mother took in a lighted lamp and set it on the table by him.

“He didn’t see or hear me!” was her report. “He is a quarter through
the book already, and he doesn’t skip a word.”

He spent just fifteen minutes at the supper-table. It was two o’clock
in the morning before he reached the last page.

After prayers next morning he put his arm about me and held me fast for
a moment. Then he kissed me very gravely.

“I was right about that book, daughter!”

That was all! but it was, to my speechless self, as if the morning
stars had sung together for joy.

I record here and now what I did not know in the spring-tide of my
happiness. I never had—I shall never have—another reader like him. As
long as he lived, he “believed” in me and in my work with a sincerity
and fervor as impossible for me to describe as it can be for any
outsider to believe. He made the perusal of each volume (and they
numbered a score before he died) as solemn a ceremony as he instituted
for the first. His absolute absorption in it was the secret jest of
the family, but they respected it at heart. When he talked with me of
the characters that bore part in my stories, he treated them as real
flesh-and-blood entities. He found fault with one, and sympathized with
another, and argued with a third, as seeing them in propia personæ.
It was strange—phenomenal—when one considers the light weight of the
literature under advisement and the mental calibre of the man. To me
it was at once inspiration and my exceeding great reward.

                                              “June 5th, 1854.

    “DEAR EFFIE,—From a formidable pile of letters of good
    wishes and congratulation, I select (not happen upon!)
    your sweet, affectionate epistle, every word of which, if it
    did not come from your heart, went straight to mine.

    “I shall never be a literary iceberg! That is clear. I have
    had a surfeit of compliments in public and in private, but
    a word of appreciation from a true, loving friend gives me
    more delicious pleasure than all else.

    “I make no excuse for speaking freely to you of what you
    say is ‘near akin’ to you. I thank you heartily for owning
    the relationship. Two editions have been ‘run off’ already,
    and another is now in press—unprecedented success in this
    part of the world—or so they tell me. Northern papers notice
    the book more at length and more handsomely than does the
    Richmond press.

    “Of the sales in your county, I know nothing. Oh yes! C. W.
    told Mr. Rhodes that ‘Miss Virginia Hawes’s novel is having
    a tremendous run in Powhatan. Tre-men-dous, sir! Why, I
    had an order to buy a copy and send it up, myself, sir!’

    “Isn’t that characteristic?”




XXV

BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH MY FATE


THE promised visit to Powhatan was paid in July.

           “How happily the days of Thalaba went by!”

I said over the strangely musical line to myself scores of times in the
two months of my stay in the dear old county. “Homestead,” the home of
the D.’s, was never more beautiful, and the days were full of innocent
fun, and junketings without number. College and University boys were at
home, and city people were flocking to the country. There were walks,
drives, “dining-days,” early and late horseback parties, setting out
from one hospitable house before sunrise, and breakfasting at another
ten or twelve miles away; or, better yet, leaving home at sunset, and
pacing, cantering, and galloping (women never rode trotting horses)
along highroad and plantation lane to a house, buried in ancestral
woods, in the very heart of the county, for supper, returning by the
light of the harvest moon, as fresh as when we set forth. With no
premonition that this was to be the most eventful summer and autumn of
my hitherto tranquil life, I gave myself up, wholly and happily, to the
influences that sweetened and glorified it.

Late in August I resolved rather suddenly to go home. My sister was
in Boston; my father would not leave his business for so much as a
week; my mother and the younger children ought to be in the country.
Since she would not resign my father to what she spoke of as “Fate and
servants,” I would throw my now rejuvenated body into the breach,
abide by the stuff and her husband and sons, while she took a sadly
needed rest with old friends in Nottoway County.

Recollecting how persistently I clung to the decision in the face of a
tempest of protest, my own heart in secret league with the protestants,
I acknowledge with humble gratitude the guidance of the “moving finger
that writes” out the destinies we think to control for ourselves.

The glow of the halcyon summer had not passed from my spirit when I
wrote to my late hostess two days after my return:

                              “RICHMOND, August 29th, 1854.

    “MY OWN FRIEND,—I said ‘I will write next week,’ but it
    suits my feelings and convenience to write this morning.

    “In the first place, my heart is so full of happiness
    that it overflows upon and toward everybody that I love,
    and don’t you dear Homesteadians—yourself and Powhie,
    especially—come in for a share?

    “Mrs. Noble was very pleasant, but the journey was a bit
    tedious. It always is! Richmond looked enchanting when at
    last the spires and chimneys appeared upon the horizon, and
    my sweet home was never so pretty before.

    “Mother had planned an agreeable surprise, and not told
    me that the painters had been at work elsewhere than in
    my room. So the freshly painted shutters and the white
    window-facings and cornices, contrasted with the gray
    walls, were doubly beautiful, because not expected. Then
    Percy came tumbling down the steps, clapping his hands and
    shouting in glee, and Alice’s bright smile shone upon me at
    the gate, and mother left company in the parlor to give me
    four kisses—and all I could say was, ‘I have had such a
    pleasant visit, and now I am so glad to see you all!’

    “Father could not be coaxed to bed that night until one
    o’clock, although mother reminded him that he had a headache.

    “‘Never mind! Daughters don’t come home every night!’

    “‘But this one will be tired out!’

    “‘Well, she may sleep late to-morrow morning.’

    “He doesn’t know how lazy I have grown of late.

    “I am surprised to find vegetation so luxuriant here. My
    inquiries concerning the ‘late drought’ are answered by a
    stare of amazement. Rain has been abundant in this region.
    In our garden the vegetables and grape-vines grow rank and
    tall. And as for flowers! There were seven bouquets in
    the parlor, smiling and breathing a welcome. Last night I
    received one per rail from Horace Lacy (bless his soul!),
    and Herbert to-night brought up another and a magnificent,
    when he came to his late supper.

    “Mother had delicious peaches for supper the night I got
    back, but advised me to ‘eat them sparingly, at first.’
    Yesterday I forgot her caution, and I think I am the better
    for the lapse. Peaches, watermelons, apples, sweet potatoes,
    etc., were liberally patronized by us all. The cholera
    ‘scare’ seems to be over. Doctor Haxall advised the members
    of our family to make no change in their diet while they
    continued well, and they have prospered wonderfully under
    his regimen....

    “I wish I had time to tell you of some queer letters I found
    waiting for me. Father would not forward them, ‘for fear
    of annoying me.’ They are meant to be complimentary, one
    requesting ‘some particulars of your birthplace, education,’
    etc. ‘Wish he may get them!’

    “Now, dear, forgive this egotistical scrawl—written as fast
    as fingers can scratch—but just seat yourself and tell me
    exactly what you have been doing, saying, and thinking
    since I left; how our pet, Powhie (the dear old scamp!), is
    thriving; and the state of your mother’s health, also the
    news from The Jungle.

    “Our Heavenly Father bless and love you, my darling!”

We packed my mother and her younger children off to the country the
first of September, and rejoiced unselfishly that they had escaped the
fervid heats of the following week. Our house was deliciously cool by
comparison with the sultriness of the outer world. The thick walls
and lofty ceilings kept the temperature at an equable and comfortable
point. We breakfasted early, and by nine o’clock the day was my own—or
six consecutive hours of it.

In unconscious imitation of Charlotte Brontë, who began Jane Eyre
while The Professor was “plodding his weary round from publisher to
publisher,” I had begun another book by the time Alone was turned
over to the tender mercies of Mr. Morris’s “reader.” I finished the
first draught on the forenoon of September 11th, having wrought at it
with the fierce joy in work that ever comes to me after a season of
absolute or comparative idleness.

I was very weary when the last word was written:

“Alma was asleep!”

I read it aloud to myself in the safe solitude of my shaded library. I
had not heard then that Thackeray slapped his thigh exultantly after
describing the touch of pride Becky felt in her husband’s athletic
pummelling of her lover. I could have understood it fully at that
instant.

“Thackeray, my boy, that is a stroke of genius!” cried the great
author, aloud, in honest pride.

The small woman writer sat wearily back in her chair, and said—not
murmured: “I flatter myself that is a neat touch!”

Then I found that my head ached. Moreover, it had a strange, empty
feeling. I compared it to a squeezed sponge. I likewise reminded myself
that I had not been out of the house for two days; that my father had
shaken his head when I told him it was “too hot for walking,” warning
me that I “must not throw away the good the country had done for me.”
He would ask me, at supper-time, if I had taken the admonition to heart.

I went off to my room, bathed, and dressed for a round of calls. This
I proceeded to make, keeping on the shady side of the street. I called
at three houses, and found everybody out. The sun was setting when I
stood in front of my mirror on my return, and laid aside bonnet and
mantle (we called it a “visite”). The red light from the west shot
across me while I was brushing up the hair the hot dampness had laid
flat. It struck me suddenly that I was looking rather well. I wore what
we knew as a “spencer” of thin, dotted white muslin. It would be a
“shirt-waist” to-day. It was belted at what was then a slim waist above
a skirt of “changeable” silk. Herbert had said it “reminded him of a
pale sunrise,” but there were faint green reflections among shimmering
pinks. There must be somebody in the immediate neighborhood upon whom
I might call while I was dressed to go out. A dart of self-reproach
followed swiftly upon the thought.

My old and favorite tutor, Mr. Howison, had broken down in health
two years after accepting a call to his first parish. An obstinate
affection of the throat made preaching impracticable. At the end of
a year of compulsory inaction, he resumed the practice of law in
Richmond, and within another twelve months married the woman he had
sought and won before his illness. They lived in a pleasant house upon
the next street, so near that we often “ran around” to see each other.
“Mary’s” younger sister had died during my absence from home, and as I
reminded myself, now, I ought to have called before this.

Half a square from her door, I recalled that the young clergyman who
was supplying Doctor Hoge’s pulpit while he was abroad, and whom I
had heard preach last Sunday, was staying at the Howison’s. It was
not right, in the eyes of the church, that he should go to a hotel,
and since he would go nowhere except as a boarder, the Howisons had
opened door and hearts to make him at home in his temporary charge.
He had given us an interesting sermon on Sunday, and made a pleasing
impression generally. I had not thought of him since, until almost at
the gate of my friends’ house. Then I said, inly:

“Should the youthful divine be hanging about the porch or yard, I’ll
walk on unconcernedly and postpone the call.”

Being familiar with the ways of young sprigs of divinity, and having
over twenty blood-relatives who had the right to prefix their baptismal
names by “The Reverend,” I had no especial fondness for the brand.
Furthermore, three callow clerics and one full-fledged had already
invited me to share parsonage and poverty with them. For all I had
one and the same reply. It might be my predestined lot, as certain
anxious friends began to hint, to live out my earthly days in single
blessedness; and, if the ancient anti-race-suicide apostles were to be
credited, then to lead apes in Hades for an indefinite period. I would
risk the terrors of both states sooner than take upon me the duties and
liabilities of a minister’s wife. Upon that I was determined.

The youthful divine was nowhere in sight. Nor did he show up during the
half-hour I passed with the Howisons. They proposed walking home with
me when I arose to go. Just outside the gate we espied a tall figure
striding up the street, swinging his cane in very unclerical style. Mr.
Howison stopped.

“Ah, Mr. Terhune! I was hoping you might join us.”

Then he introduced him to me. Of course, he asked permission to
accompany us, and we four strolled abreast through the twilight of the
embowered street. I had known the sister of Mr. Terhune, who, as the
widow of Doctor Hoge’s most intimate friend, was a frequent visitor to
Richmond. I asked civilly after her, and was answered as civilly. We
remarked upon the heat of the day and the fine sunset; then we were at
our gate, where my father and brother were looking out for me.

My escorts declined the invitation to enter garden and house; Mr.
Howison passed over to me a big bunch of roses he had gathered from his
garden and brought with him, and, having exchanged “Good-evenings,”
we three lingered at the gate to admire the flowers. There was no
finer collection of roses in any private garden in town than those
which were the lawyer’s pets and pride. My face was buried in the cool
deliciousness of my bouquet when, through the perfect stillness of the
evening, we heard our new acquaintance say:

“Your friend, Miss Hawes, walks well.”

He had, as we had noticed on Sunday, a voice of marvellous compass,
with peculiar “carrying” qualities. He had not spoken more loudly
than his companions, and, having reached the corner of the street, he
fancied himself beyond earshot. Every word floated back to us.

We laughed—all three of us. Then I said, deliberately:

“If that man ever asks me to marry him, I shall have to do it! I vowed
solemnly, long ago, to marry the first man who thinks me handsome, if
he should give me the chance. Let us hope this one won’t!”

“Amen!” responded my hearers, my father adding, “His cloth rules him
out.”

It may have been a week later in the season that I was strolling down
Broad Street in company with “Tom” Baxter, Mr. Rhodes’s chummiest
crony. He had overtaken me a few squares farther up-town, and was
begging me, in the naïve way most girls found bewitching, to take a
turning that would lead us by an office where he was to leave a paper
he had promised to deliver at that hour.

“Then,” he pursued, with the same refreshing simplicity of tone and
