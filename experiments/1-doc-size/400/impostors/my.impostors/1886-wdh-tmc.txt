thoughtfully, " why we despise certain occupations!
We don't despise a man who hammers stone or saws 
boards ; why should we despise a barber ? Is the 
care of the human head intrinsically less honourable 
than the shaping of such rude material "? Why do we 
still contemn the tailor who clothes us, and honour 
the painter who portrays us in the same clothes ? 
Why do we despise waiters ? I tried to make 
Barker believe that I respected all kinds of honest 
work. But I lied ; I despised him for having waited 
on table. Why have all manner of domestics fallen 
under our scorn, and come to be stigmatised in a lump 
as servants ? " 

"Ah, I don't know," said the minister. " There is 
something in personal attendance upon us that dis 
honours ; but the reasons of it are very obscure ; / 
couldn't give them. Perhaps it 's because it 's work 
that in a simpler state of things each of us would do 
for himself, and in this state is too proud to do." 

" That doesn't cover the whole ground," said 
Evans. 

" And you think that poor boy is troubled is 
really suffering from a sense of inferiority to the 
other young people ? " 

" Oh, I don't say certainly. Perhaps not. But if 
he were, what should you say was the best thing for 
him to do ? Remain a servant ; cast his lot with 
these outcasts; or try to separate and distinguish 
himself from them, as we all do ! Come ; we live in 



 

the world, which isn't so bad, though it 's pretty 
stupid. He couldn't change it. Now, what ought 
he to do ? " 

Sewell mused a while without answering anything. 
Then he said with a smile, "It 's very much simpler 
to fit people for the other world than for this, don't 
you think ? " 

"Yes, it is. It was a cold day for the clergy 
when it was imagined that they ought to do both." 

" Well," said Sewell, rising to follow his friend to 
the door, " I will come to see Barker, and try to talk 
with him. He 's a very complicated problem. I 
supposed that I had merely his material prosperity to 
provide for, after getting him down here, but if I have 
to reconcile him to the constitution of society ! " 

" Yes," said Evans. " I wish you'd let me know 
the result of your labours. I think I could make a 
very incisive article on the subject. The topic is 
always an attractive one. There is nobody who 
doesn't feel that somebody else is taking on airs with 
him, and ought to have his comb cut. Or, if you 
should happen to prove to Barker that his ignominy 
is in accordance with the Development Theory, and 
is a necessary Survival, or something of that sort, 
don't you see what a card it would be for us with 
the better classes ? " 

They wenf downstairs together, and at the street 
door Evans stopped again. "Or, I'll tell you what. 
Make it a simple study of Barker 's mind a sort of 
psychological interview, and then with what I've  
been able to get from him we can present the im- 



 

pression that Boston makes upon a young, fresh, 
shrewd mind. That would be something rather new, 
wouldn't it ? Come ! the Afternoon would make it 
worth your while. And then you could work it 
into a sermon afterwards." 

" You shameless reprobate ! " said Sewell, laying 
his hand affectionately on his friend 's arm. 

There was nothing in Lemuel 's case that seemed 
to him urgent, and he did not go to see him at once. 
In the meantime, Fast Day came, and Lemuel got 
away at last to pay his first visit home. 

" Seems to me ye ain't lookin over and above 
well, Lem," was the first thing his mother said to 
him, even before she noticed how well he was 
dressed. 

His new spring overcoat, another prize from the 
Misfit Parlours, and his new pointed-toe shoes, and 
Derby hat, with the suit of clothes he had kept so 
carefully all through the winter, were not the 
complete disguise he had fancied they might be at 
Willoughby Pastures. The depot-master had known 
him as soon as he got out of the cars, and ignored 
his splendour in recognising him. He said, " Hello, 
Lem," and had not time to reconcile himself to the 
boy 's changed appearance before Lemuel hurried away 
with the bag he had bought so long before for the 
visit. He met several people on his way home from 
the depot : two of them were women, and one of 
these said she knew as soon as she looked at him 
who it was, and the other said she should have 
known it was Lem Barker as far as she could see 



 OR, 

him. She asked him if he was home for good 
now. 

His mother pushed back his thick hair with her 
hard old hand as she spoke to him, and then she 
pressed his head down upon her neck, which was 
mostly collar-bone. But Lemuel .could hear her 
heart beat, and the tears came into his eyes. 

" Oh, I' m all right, mother," he said huskily, 
though he tried to say it cheerfully. He let her 
hold his head there the longer because mixed with 
his tenderness for her was a horror of her bloomers, 
which he was not at once able to overcome. When 
he gained courage to look, he saw that she had them 
on, but now he had the strength to bear it. 

" Ye had any breakfast ? " she asked, and when he 
said that he had got a cup of coffee at Fitchburg, 
she said, well, she must get him something, and she 
drew him a cup of Japan tea, and made him some 
milk toast and picked-fish, talking all the time, and 
telling him how his sister and her husband had gone 
to the village to have one of her teeth drawn. 
They had got along through the winter pretty well ; 
but she guessed that they would have had more to 
complain of if it had not been for him. This was her 
way of acknowledging the help Lemuel had given 
them every week, and it was casually sandwiched 
between an account of an Indian Spirit treatment 
which Eeuben had tried for his rheumatism, and a 
question whether Lemuel had seen anything of that 
Mind Cure down to Boston. 

But when he looked about the room, and saw here 



 

and there the simple comforts and necessaries which his 
money had bought the sick man and the two helpless 
women, his heart swelled with joy and pride ; and he 
realised the pleasure we all feel in being a good 
genius. At times it had come pretty hard to send the 
greater part of his week 's wages home, but now he was 
glad he had done it. The poor, coarse food which 
his mother had served him as a treat; the low, 
cracked ceilings ; the waving floor, covered with rag 
carpet ; the sagging doors, and the old-fashioned trim 
of the small-paned windows, were all very different 
from the luxurious abundance, the tesselated pave 
ment, and the tapestry Brussels, the lofty studding, 
and the black walnut mouldings of the St. Albans; and 
Lemuel felt the difference with a curious mixture of 
pride and remorse in his own escape from the mean 
ness of his home. He felt the self-reproach to which 
the man who rises without raising with him all those 
dear to him is destined in some measure all his life. 
His interests and associations are separated from 
theirs, but if he is not an ignoble spirit, the ties of 
affection remain unweakened ; he cares for them 
with a kind of indignant tenderness, and calls him 
self to account before them in the midst of pleasures 
which they cannot share, or even imagine. 

Lemuel 's mother did not ask him much about 
his life in Boston; she had not the materials for 
curiosity about it ; but he told her everything thai) 
he thought she could understand. She recurred to 
his hopes when he left home and their disappoint 
ment in Sewell, and she asked if Lemuel ever saw 



 

him nowadays. She could not reconcile herself to 
his reconciliation with Sewell, whom she still held to 
have behaved treacherously. Then she went back 
to Lemuel 's looks, and asked him if he kept pretty 
well; and, when he answered that he did, she 
smoothed with her hand the knot between her eyes, 
and did not question him further. 

He had the whole forenoon with his mother, and 
he helped her to get the dinner, as he used to do, 
pulling the stove-wood out of the snow-drift that still 
embedded part of the wood-pile, though the snow was 
all gone around Boston. It was thawing under the 
dull, soft April sky, and he saw the first bluebird 
perched on the clothes-line when he went out for the 
wood ; his mother said there had been lots of them. 
He walked about the place, and into the barn, taking 
in the forlornness and shabbiness ; and then he went 
up into the room over the shed, where he used to 
study and write. His heart ached with self-pity. 

He realised as he had not done at a distance how 
dependent this wretched home was upon him ; and 
after meaning the whole morning to tell his mother 
about Statira, he decided that he was keeping it from 
her, not merely because he was ashamed to tell her 
that he was engaged, but because it seemed such a 
crazy thing, for a person in his circumstances, if it 
was really an engagement. He had not seen Statira 
since that night when he brought her to look at the 
pictures the art-students had made of him. He felt 
that he had not parted with her kindly, and he went 
to see her the night before he started home, though 



 

it was not Sunday, but he had found her door locked, 
and this made him angry with her, he could not have 
said just why. If he told his mother about Statira 
now, what should he tell her ? He compromised by 
telling her about the two girls that had painted his 
likeness. 

His mother seemed not to care a great deal about 
the pictures. She said, "I don't want you should 
let any girl make a fool of you, Lem." 

" Oh no," he answered, and went and looked out 
of the window. 

"I don't say but what they're  nice girls enough, 
but in your place you no need to throw yourself 
away." 

Lemuel thought of the awe of Miss Carver in 
which he lived, and the difference between them ; 
and he could have laughed at his mother 's ignorant 
pride. What would she say if she knew that he 
was engaged to a girl that worked in a box-factory ? 
But probably she would not think that studying art 
and teaching it was any better. She evidently 
believed that his position in the St. Albans was 
superior to that of Miss Carver. 

His sister and her husband came home before they 
had finished dinner. His sister had her face all tied 
up to keep from taking cold after having her tooth 
drawn, and Lemuel had to go out and help his 
rheumatic brother-in-law put up the horse. When 
they came in, his brother-in-law did not wash his 
hands before going to the table, and Lemuel could 
not keep his eyes off his black and broken finger- 




nails ; his mother 's and sister 's nails were black too. 
It must have been so when he lived at home. 

His sister could not eat ; she took some tea, and 
went to bed. His brother-in-law pulled off his boots 
after dinner, and put up* his stocking-feet on the 
stove-hearth to warm them. 

There was no longer any chance to talk with his 
mother indoors, and he asked her if she would not 
like to come out ; it was very mild. She put on her 
bonnet, and they strolled down the road. All the 
time Lemuel had to keep from looking at her 
bloomers. When they met any one driving, he 
had to keep himself from trying to look as if he 
were not with her, but was just out walking alone. 

The day wore heavily away. His brother-in-law 's 
rheumatism came on toward evening, and his sister 's 
face had swollen, so that it would not do for her to 
go out. Lemuel put on some old clothes he found in 
his room, and milked the cows himself. 

"Like old times, Lem," said his mother, when he 
came in. 

" Yes," he assented quietly. 

He and his mother had tea together, but pretty 
soon afterwards she seemed to get sleepy; and 
Lemuel said he had been up early and he guessed he 
would go to bed. His mother said she guessed she 
would go too. 

After he had blown out his light, she came in to 
see if he were comfortable. " I presume it seems a 
pretty poor place to you, Lem," she said, holding 
her lamp up and looking round. 



 

"I guess if it 's good enough for you it is for 
me," he answered evasively. 

" No, it ain t," she said. " I always b en used to 
it, and I can see from your talk that you've  got used 
to something different already. Well, it 's right, 
Lem. You're  a good boy, and I want you should 
get the good of Boston, all you can. We don't any 
of us begrutch it to ye ; and what I came up to say 
now was, don't you scrimp yourself down there to 
send home to us. We got a roof over our heads, 
and we can keep soul and body together somehow ; 
we always have, and we don't need a great deal. 
But I want you should keep yourself nicely dressed 
down to Boston, so t you can go with the best ; I 
don't want you should feel anyways meechin on 
account of your clothes. You got a good figure, 
Lem ; you take after your father. Sometimes I 
wish you was a little bigger ; but he wa n't ; and he 
had a big spirit. He wa n't afraid of anything ; and 
they said if he'd come out o that battle where he 
was killed, he'd V b en a captain. He was a good 
man." 

She had hardly ever spoken so much of his father 
before ; he knew now by the sound of her voice in 
the dim room that the tears must be in her eyes j 
but she governed herself and went on. 

" What I wanted to say was, don't you keep send- 
in so much o your money home, child. It 's yours, 
and I want you should have it ; most of it goes for 
patent medicines, anyway, when it gets here ; we 
can't keep Reuben from buying em, and he 's always 



 

changin doctors. And I want you should hold 
yourself high, Lem. You're  as good as anybody. 
And don't you go with any girls, especially, that 
ain't of the best. You're  gettin to that time o life 
when you'll begin to think about em ; but don't you 
go and fall in love with the first little poppet you see, 
because she 's got pretty eyes and curly hair." 

It seemed to Lemuel as if she must know about 
Statira, but of course she did not. He lay still, and 
she went on. 

"Don't you go and get engaged, or any such 
foolishness in a hurry, Lem. Them art-student 
girls you was tellin about, I presume they're  all 
right enough ; but you wait a while. Young men 
think it 's a kind of miracle if a girl likes em, and 
they're  ready to go crazy over it ; but it 's the most 
natural thing she can do. You just wait a while. 
When you get along a little further, you can pick and 
choose for yourself. I don't know as I should want you 
should marry for money ; but don't you go and take 
up with the first thing comes along, because you're  
afraid to look higher. What 's become o that nasty 
thing that talked so to you at that Miss Vane s?" 

Lemuel said that he had never seen Sibyl or Miss 
Vane since ; but he did not make any direct 
response to the anxieties his mother had hinted at. 
Her pride in him, so ignorant of all the reality of 
his life in the city, crushed him more than the sight 
and renewed sense of the mean conditions from which 
he had sprung. What if he should tell her that Miss 
Carver, whom she did not want him to marry in a 



 

hurry, regarded him as a servant, and treated him 
as she would treat a black man ? What if she knew 
that he was as good as engaged to marry a girl that 
could no more meet Miss Carver on the same level 
than she could fly ? He could only tell his mother
