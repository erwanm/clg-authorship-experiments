"Straight !" said the other. "Her father's the earl of Skye- 
terrier, or some such damn place." 

"Aw, cut it out !" growled the little machinist for you never 
knew in dealing with these soldier boys whether you were being 
"kidded" or not. 

"Did you ask her name?" 

"She told me it was Miss Clendenning." 

"Well, you ask her if she ain't the Honourable Beatrice Clen- 
denning, and see what she says." 

But Jimmie could not get up the nerve to ask. When the 
young lady came back, carrying his chamber washed clean, her 
pet patient was lying still, but so red in the face that she sus- 
pected that he had been trying to get out of bed without per- 
mission. 





Nor was that the end of wonders. Next day there ran a 
murmur of excitement through the ward, and everything was 
cleaned up fresh, though there was really nothing that needed 
cleaning. Flowers were brought in, and each nurse had a flower 
pinned on her waist. When Jimmie asked what was "up," the 





Honourable Beatrice looked at him with a quizzical smile. 
"We're going to have some distinguished visitors' she said. 
"But you won't be interested a class-conscious proletarian like 
you."' 

And she would not tell him; but when she went out, the 
fellow in the next bed told. "It's the king and queen that's 
comin'," said the gun-pointer. 

"Aw, ferget it!" said Jimmie quite sure he was being 
"kidded" this time. 

"Comin' to see the submarine victims," said the gun-pointer. 
"You cut out your Socialist rough stuff for to-day." 

Jimmie asked the nurse when she came back; and sure 
enough, it was true the king and queen were to visit the hos- 
pital, and pay their respects to the victims of the U-boat. But 
that wouldn't interest Jimmie Higgins. Would he not rather 
be carried away and put in a private room somewhere, so that 
his revolutionary eyes would not be offended? Or would he 
stay, and make a soap-boxer of His Majesty? 

"Sure, he won't have no time to talk to a feller like me!" 
said Jimmie. 

"Don't you be too sure," replied the other. "He's got noth- 
ing to do but talk, you know !" 

Jimmie didn't venture any farther, because he knew that the 
Honourable Beatrice was laughing at him, and he had never been 
laughed at by a woman before, and didn't know quite how to 
take it. He could not have been expected to understand that 
the Honourable Beatrice was a suffragette, and laughed at all 
men on general principles. Jimmie lay quietly in his bed and 
concealed the unworthy excitement in his soul. Wasn't that 
the devil now? Him, a little runt of a workingman from no- 
where in particular, that had been brought up on a charity- 
farm, and spent a good part of his life on the bum him to be 
meeting the king of England ! Jimmie had a way of disposing 
of kings that was complete and final; he called them "kinks," 
and when he had called them that he had settled them, wiped 
them clean out. "None o' them kinks fer me!" he had said 
to the Honourable Beatrice. 

But now a "kink" was coming to the hospital ! And what was 
Jimmie going to do ? How the devil did you talk to 'em ? Did 
you have to say, "Your Majesty"? Jimmie gripped his hands 
under the bed-covers, "I'll be damned if I do !" He summoned 



his revolutionary fervour, he called up the spirits of his "wobbly" 
friends, "Wild Bill" and "Strawberry" Curran and "Flathead 
Joe" and "Chuck" Peterson. What would they do under these 
circumstances? What would the Candidate do? Somehow, 
Jimmie's revolutionary education had been neglected nothing 
had ever been said in any Socialist local as to how a comrade 
should behave when a "lank" came to visit him! 

Jimmy was naturally a kindly human being; he was ready 
to respond to the kindness of other human beings. But was 
it in accord with revolutionary ethics' to be polite to a "kink" ? 
Was it not his duty to do something to show his contempt for 
"kinks"? Maybe his Royal Nibs never had anybody to "stand 
up to him" in all his life before. Well, let him have it to-day t 

IV 

A nurse rushed into the ward in great excitement, and 
whispered, "They're coming!" And after that the nurses all 
stood round, twisting their hands together nervously, and the 
patients lay with their eyes glued on the door where the appari- 
tion was to appear. 

At last there came in sight a man dressed in uniform, who 
Jimmie would never have dreamed could be a king except that 
he had seen his picture in the illustrated papers. He was a 
medium-sized, rather stoop-shouldered little gentleman, decidedly 
commonplace-looking, with a closely trimmed brown beard turn- 
ing grey, and rosy cheeks such as all Englishmen have. He was 
escorted by the head of the hospital-staff ; and behind him came 
a lady, a severe-looking lady dressed in black, with a couple more 
doctors escorting her, and behind them several officers in uni- 
form. 

The king and queen stopped at the head of the room, and 
looked down the rows of beds. Each of them wore a friendly 
smile, and nodded, and said, "How do you do ?" And of course 
everybody smiled back, and the nurses curtsied and said, "How 
do you do, Your Majesties?" And then His Majesty said, "I 
hope everybody is doing well ?" And the doctor called the head 
nurse in charge of the ward, who came up smiling and bowing, 
and answered that everybody was doing beautifully, thank you ; 
at which both His Majesty and Her Majesty declared that they 
were so pleased. The queen looked about, and seeing a man with 





many bandages, went to him and sat by his bedside and began to 
ask him questions ; the king moved down the centre of the room, 
until suddenly his eye happened on the Honourable Beatrice. 

She had not moved; she stood at her place like the other 
nurses. But Jimmie, watching, saw a smile come upon the 
king's face, and he moved towards her, saying, "Oh! How do 
you do?" The young lady went to meet him, quite as if she 
were used to meeting kings every day. 

"How are your patients doing?" inquired His Majesty. 

"Beautifully," said she; and His Majesty said that he was 
pleased just as if he had not said the same words only a 
minute before. He looked at the patients with benevolent but 
tired-looking eyes ; and the Honourable Beatrice, by those subtle 
methods known to women, brought it about that he looked 
especially at her favourite. She knew that he would wish to talk 
to some of the patients, and by ever so slight a movement she 
brought it about that it was towards Jimmie Higgins he ad- 
vanced. 

"What is your name?" he asked, and then, <f Well, Higgins, 
how are you feeling ?" 

"Sure, I'm all right," said Jimmie sturdily; "I wanner get 
up, only she won't let me." 

"Well," said His Majesty, "the time was when the king was 
the tyrant, but now it's the nurse." He smiled at the Honour- 
able lady. "Are you an American soldier?" 

"Naw," replied Jimmie, "I'm only a machinist." 

"This is a war of machines," replied His Majesty, gra- 
ciously. 

"I'm a Socialist !" exclaimed Jimmie, right off the bat. 

"Indeed!" said His Majesty. 

"You bet !" was the reply. 

"But you're not one of those Socialists who oppose their 
country, I see." 

"I done it for a long time," said Jimmie. "I didn't see 
we had no business in this here war. But I been changin' a 
bit." 

"I'm glad to hear that," remarked His Majesty. "Doubtless 
your recent experience has helped you to change." 

"Sure," replied Jimmie. "But I'm still a Socialist, don't you 
make no mistake about that, Mr. King." 

"I won't' said His Majesty; and he looked at the Honour- 



 

able Beatrice, and between them there flashed one of those 
subtle messages which highly sophisticated people know how to 
give and to catch entirely over the heads of Socialist machin- 
ists from Leesville, U. S. A. To the Honourable Beatrice the 
message conveyed, "How perfectly delicious !" To His Majesty 
it conveyed, "I knew you'd enjoy it!" 

Jimmie's mind was of course occupied entirely with the 
idea of propaganda. He must make the most of this strange 
opportunity! "Things is goin' to be changed after this here 
war !" said he. "Fer the workin' people, I mean." 

"They'll be changed for all of us," said His Majesty. "The 
dullest of us know that." 

"The workin' people got to get what they earn!" persisted 
Jimmie. "Why, Mr. King back home where I come from a 
feller could work twelve hours a day all his life, an' not have 
enough saved up to bury himself with. An' they say it was 
worse here in England." 

"We have had terrible poverty," admitted His Majesty. 
"We shall have to find some way of getting rid of it." 

"There ain't no way but Socialism !" cried Jimmie. "Look 
into it, an' you'll see ! We gotter get rid o' the profit-system. 
The feller that does the work has gotter get what he produces." 

"Well," said His Majesty, "you'll agree with me this far at 
least we must beat the Germans first." And then he turned 
to the Honourable Beatrice. "We shall learn much from our 
American visitors," he said, and flashed her another of those 
subtle messages, which indicated that perhaps it was not a good 
thing for patients in hospitals to become excited over Socialist 
propaganda! So the Honourable Beatrice turned to the man 
in the other bed, and His Majesty turned also; he ascertained 
that the man's name was Deakin, and that he came from Cape 
Cod. His Majesty remarked how badly England needed good 
Yankee gun-pointers, and how grateful he was to those who came 
to help the British navy. Jimmie listened, just a tiny bit jealous 
not for himself, of course, but because he knew that Socialism 
was so much more important than gun-pointing ! 



At the foot of the bed there stood a military officer. He had 
been there for some time, but Jimmie did not notice him till the 





king arose and moved away. The officer was just the sort of 
hand-made aristocrat that Jimmie imagined all officers to be; 
smooth-shaven, except for a little toy moustache, with serene, im- 
passive features, a dapper and immaculate uniform, and a queer 
little fancy stick in his hand, to show that he never did anything 
resembling work. He was eyeing the machinist, with what the 
machinist suspected to be a superior air. "Well, my good man," 
said he, "you had a talk with the king !" 

That seemed obvious enough. "Sure !" said Jimmie. 

"Generally," continued the officer, "wFen one talks with the 
king, one addresses him as 'Your Majesty' not as 'Mr. King." 

Jimmie was tired now, and not looking for controversy; so 
he did not bridle as he might otherwise have done. "Nobody 
told me' said he. 

"Also," continued the other, "one is not supposed to volunteer 
opinions. One waits for the king to ask a question, and then one 



answers." 



Jimmie's eyes were closed, and he only half opened them as 
he answered. "They been tellin' me this here is a war for 
Democracy !" said he. 






THEY gave Jimmie Higgins a couple of days to lie about on 
 the grounds of the hospital, and make the acquaintance and 
hear the experiences of men who had lost arms and legs in bat- 
tle, or had been burned by flame-throwers, or ruined for life by 
poison-gases. Strange as it might seem, Jimmie found among 
these men not a few with whom he could talk, whose point of 
view was close to his own. These Britishers had been through 
the mill ; they knew. None of the glory stuff for them ! Leave 
that for the newspaper scribblers, the bloody rascals who stayed 
at home and beat on tomtoms, driving other men to march in 
and die. You went and got yourself battered up, ruined for 
life and then what would they do for you? It was a hard 
world to a man who was crippled and helpless. Yes, said 
Jimmie; the same hard world that it was to a Socialist, a 
dreamer of justice. 

But there was the old dilemma, from which he had never 
been able to find escape, whether in Leesville, U. S. A., or on 
the high seas, or here in old England. What were you going to 
do about the Huns? To hold out your hand to them was like 
putting it into a tiger's cage. No, by God, you had to fight 
them, you had to lick them, cost what it might! And the 
speaker would go on and tell of things he had seen : a Prussian 
officer who had shot a British surgeon in the back, after this 
surgeon had bound up his wounds; a commandant of a prison- 
camp who had withdrawn all medical aid in a typhus-epidemic, 
and allowed his charges to perish like rats. 

So, hell though it was, you had to go through with it ; if you 
were a man, you had to set your teeth and grip your hands and 
take your share of the horror, whatever it might be. And 
Jimmie, being something of a little man in his way, would set 




his teeth and grip his hands and take, in imagination, the share 
of the particular human wreck who happened to be talking to 
him. So Jimmie Higgins was battered back and forth, like a 
tennis-ball between the two forces of Militarism and Eevolution. 
Just now was another crisis the Huns had begun a furious 
drive in Flanders, the third battle of Ypres, and the British 
were falling back, not in rout, but in retreat which might be- 
come rout at any hour. The bulletins came in several times 
a day, and people on the streets would stop and read them, their 
faces full of fear. When the wind was right you could hear 
the guns across the channel; Jimmie would lie at night and 
listen to the dull, incessant thunder a terrific, man-made storm, 
in which showers of steel were raining down upon the heads of 
soldiers hiding in shell-holes and hastily dug trenches. The 
war seemed very near indeed when the wind was right ! 





Still, a fellow has to live. Jimmie was in a foreign land 
for the first time in his life, and when they turned him loose, 
he and a couple of other American chaps went wandering about 
the streets, staring at the sights of this town, which had been a 
small harbour before the war, but now was a vast centre of the 
world's commerce, one of the routes by which large sections of 
Britain were moved across the channel every day. 

You saw on the streets no men out of uniform, except a few 
old ones ; you saw nobody at all idle, except the young children. 
The women were driving the trucks, and operating the street- 
cars, which were called "trams," and the elevators, which were 
called "lifts." Everybody's face was sober and drawn, but they 
lightened up when they saw the Americans, who had come so 
far to help them in their trouble. In the cake-shops, and the 
queer little "pubs" where rosy-cheeked girls sold very thin beer, 
they could not be polite enough to the visitors from over-seas; 
even the haughtiest-looking "bobby" would stop to tell you the 
way about the streets. "First to the roight, third to the left," he 
would say, very fast ; and when you looked bewildered, he would 
say it again, as fast as ever. 

But they needed motor-cycles so badly in the new American 
armies that they didn't give Jimmie much time to be a hero; 
he got his orders, and a new outfit, and bade farewell to the 



 

Honourable Beatrice, promising to write to her now and then, 
and not to be too hard on the aristocracy. He crossed the chan- 
nel, alive with boats like the Hudson River with its ferries, 
and came to another and still bigger port, which the Americans 
had taken and made over new for the war. Long vistas of docks 
had been built since the fighting began ; Jimmie saw huge cranes 
that dipped down into the hold of a ship, and pulled out whole 
locomotives, or maybe half a dozen automobile trucks in one 
swoop. Behind these docks was a tangle of railroad-yards and 
tracks, and miles upon miles of sheds, piled to the top with 
stores of every sort you could imagine. A whole encampment- 
city covered the surrounding hills, crowned by an old, creaking, 
moss-grown windmill the Middle Ages looking in dismay upon 
these modern times. 

Nobody took the trouble to invite Jimmie to inspect these 
marvels, but he got glimpses here and there, and men with 
whom he chatted told him more. One man had been directing 
the unloading of canned tomatoes; for six months he had seen 
nothing but crates upon crates and car-loads upon car-loads of 
canned tomatoes, coming into one end of a shed and going out 
at the other. Somewhere in the higher regions dwelt a mar- 
vellous tomato-brain, which knew exactly how many cans a 
division of dough-boys in a training-camp would consume each 
day, how many would be needed by patients in hospitals, by 
lumbermen in French forests, by revellers in Y. M. C. A. huts. 
Every now and then a ship brought another supply, and the 
man who told Jimmie about it bossed a gang of negroes who
