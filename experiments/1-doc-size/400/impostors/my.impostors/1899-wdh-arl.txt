" You know how it was when you went away from 
Florence. Do you think differently now ? I don t. 
I don 't think I ought to do something for you, and 
pretend that I was doing it for religion. I don 't be 
lieve the way you do ; and I know I neva shall. Do 
you want me to go with you, afta that ? Do you want 
me, in spite of my saying that I can neva help you in 
your wo k because I believe in it ? " 

" But if you believe in me " 

She shook her head compassionately. "You know 
we ahgued that out before. We are just whe e we 
were. I am sorry. Nobody had any right to tell 
you to come he e. But I am glad you came." She 
saw the hope that lighted up his face, but she went on 
unrelentingly. " I think we had betta be free." 

"Free?" 



 

" Yes, from eacli other. I don 't know how you 
have felt, but I have not felt free. It has seemed to 
me that I promised you something. If I did, I want 
to take my promise back and be free." 

Her frankness appealed to his own. "You are 
free. I never held you bound to me in my fondest 
hopes. You have always done right." 

" I have tried to. And I am not going to let you 
go away thinking that the reason I said is the only 
reason. It isn t. I wish to be free because there is 
some one else, now." It was hard to tell him this, but 
she knew that she must not do less ; and the train 
that carried him from Venice that night bore a letter 
from her to Hinkle. 



XXXIII. 

CLEMENTINA told Miss Milray what had happened, 
but with Mrs. Milray the girl left the sudden depart 
ure of Gregory to account for itself. 

They all went a week later, and Mrs. Milray having 
now done her whole duty to Clementina had the 
easiest mind concerning her. Miss Milray felt that 
she was leaving her to greater trials than ever with 
Mrs. Lander; but since there was nothing else, she 
submitted, as people always do with the trials of 
others, and when she was once away she began to 
forget her. 

By this time, however, it was really better for her. 
With no one to suspect of tampering with her allegiance, Mrs. Lander returned to her former fondness 
for the girl, and they were more peaceful if not hap 
pier together again. They had long talks, such as 
they used to have, and in the first of these Clemen 
tina told her how and why she had written to Mr. 
Hinkle. Mrs. Lander said that it suited her exactly. 

" There haVt but just two men in Europe behaved 
like gentlemen to me, and one is Mr. Hinkle, and the 
other is that lo'd ; and between the two I rather you'd 



 

have Mr. Ilinkle ; I don 't know as I believe much in 
American guls marryin lo ds, the best of em." 

Clementina laughed. "Why, Mrs. Landa, Lo'd 
Lioncou t never thought of me in the wo ld ! " 

" You can 't eva know. Mrs. Milray was tellin 
that he 's what they call a pooa lo d, and that he was 
carryin on with the American girls like everything 
down there in Egypt last winta. I guess if it comes 
to money you'd have enough to buy him and sell him 
again." 

The mention of money cast a chill upon their talk ; 
and Mrs. Lander said gloomily, " I don 't know as I 
ca e so much for that will Mr. Milray made for me, 
after all. I did want to say ten thousand apiece for 
Mr. Landa 's relations; but I hated to befo e him; I'd 
told the whole kit of em so much about you, and I 
knew what they would think." 

She looked at Clementina with recurring grudge, 
and the girl could not bear it. 

" Then why don 't you tear it up, and make another? 
I don 't want anything, unless you want me to have it ; 
and I'd rather not have anything." 

" Yes, and what would folks say, afta youa takin 
care of me ? " 

" Do you think I do it for that ? " 

" What do you do it for ? " 

" What did you want me to come with you for ? " 

" That 's true." Mrs. Lander brightened and warmed 
again. " I guess it 's all right. I guess I done right, 
and I got to be satisfied. I presume I could get the 
consul to make me a will any time." 



 

Clementina did not relent so easily. " Mrs. Landa, 
whateva you do I don 't ca c to know it ; and if you 
talk to me again about this I shall go home. I would 
stay with you as long as you needed me, but I can 't 
if you keep bringing this up." 

" I suppose you think you don 't need me any moa ! 
Betta not be too su a." 

The girl jumped to her feet, and Mrs. Lander in 
terposed. " Well, the a ! I didn 't mean anything, 
and I won 't pesta you about it any moa. But I think 
it 's pretty ha d. Who am I going to talk it over with, 
then ? " 

" You can talk it over with the vice-consul," said 
Clementina, at random. 

" Well, that 's so." Mrs. Lander let Clementina 
get her ready for the night, in sign of returning amity ; 
when she was angry with her she always refused her 
help, and made her send Maddalena. 

The summer heat increased, and the sick woman 
suffered from it, but she could not be persuaded that 
she had strength to get away, though the vice-consul, 
whom she advised with, used all his logic with her. 
He was a gaunt and weary widower, who described 
himself as being officially between hay and grass ; the 
consul who appointed him had resigned after going 
home, and a new consul had not yet been sent out to 
remove him. On what she called her well days Mrs. 
Lander went to visit him, and she did not mind his 
being in his shirt-sleeves, in the bit of garden where 
she commonly found him, with his collar and cravat 
off, and clouded in his own smoke ; when she was sick 



 

she sent for him, to visit her. He made excuses as 
often as she could, and if he saw Mrs. Lander 's gon 
dola coming down the Grand Canal to his house he 
hurried on his cast clothing, and escaped to the Pi 
azza, at whatever discomfort and risk from the heat. 

" I don 't know how you stand it, Miss Claxon," he 
complained to Clementina, as soon as he learned that 
she was not a blood relation of Mrs. Lander s, and 
divined that she had her own reservations concerning 
her. " But that woman will be the death of me if 
she keeps this up. What does she think I 'm here 
for ? If this goes on much longer I 'll resign. The 
salary won 't begin to pay for it. What am I going 
to do ? I don 't want to hurt her feelings, or not to 
help her; but I know ten times as much about Mrs. 
Lander 's liver as I do about my own, now" 

He treated Clementina as a person of mature judgment and a sage discretion, and he accepted what 
comfort she could offer him when she explained that 
it was everything for Mrs. Lander to have him to talk 
with. " She gets ti ed of talking to me," she urged, 
" and there 's nobody else, now." 

" Why don 't she hire a valet de place, and talk to 
him ? I'd hire one myself for her. It would be a 
good deal cheaper for me. It 's as much as I can do 
to stand this weather as it is." 

The vice-consul laughed forlornly in his exaspera 
tion, but he agreed with Clementina when she said, in 
further excuse, that Mrs. Lander was really very sick. 
He pushed back his hat, and scratched his head with 
a grimace. 



"Of course, we 've  got to remember she 's sick, and 
I shall need a little sympathy myself if she keeps on 
at me this way. I believe I 'll tell her about my liver 
next time, and see how she likes it. Look here, Miss 
Claxon ! Couldn 't we get her off to some of those 
German watering places that are good for her complaints ? I believe it would be the best thing for her 
not to mention me. 

Mrs. Lander was moved by the suggestion which 
he made in person afterwards ; it appealed to her old 
nomadic instinct ; but when the consul was gone she 
gave it up. " We couldn 't git the e, Clementina. I 
got to stay he e till I git up my stren th. I suppose 
you'd be glad enough to have me sta t, now the e 's 
nobody he e but me," she added, suspiciously. " You 
git this scheme up, or him ? " 

Clementina did not defend herself, and Mrs. Lan 
der presently came to her defence. " I don 't believe 
but what he meant it for the best or you, whichever 
it was, and I appreciate it ; but all is I couldn 't git 
off. I guess this aia will do me as much good as 
anything, come to have it a little coola." 

They went every afternoon to the Lido, where a 
wheeled chair met them, and Mrs. Lander was trun 
dled across the narrow island to the beach. In the 
evenings they went to the Piazza, where their faces 
and figures had become known, and the Venetians 
gossipped them down to the last fact of their relation 
with an accuracy creditable to their ingenuity in the 
affairs of others. To them Mrs. Lander was the sick 
American, very rich, and Clementina was her adoptive 



 

daughter, who would have her millions after her. 
Neither knew the character they bore to the amiable 
and inquisitive public of the Piazza, or cared for the 
fine eyes that aimed their steadfast gaze at them along 
the tubes of straw-barreled Virginia cigars, or across 
little cups of coffee. Mrs. Lander merely remarked 
that the Venetians seemed great for gaping, and Clem 
entina was for the most part innocent of their stare. 

She rested in the choice she had made in a content 
which was qualified by no misgiving. She was sorry 
for Gregory, when she remembered him ; but her 
thought was filled with some one else, and she waited 
in faith and patience for the answer which should 
come to the letter she had written. She did not know 
where her letter would find him, or when she should 
hear from him ; she believed that she should hear, and 
that was enough. She said to herself that she would 
not lose hope if no answer came for months ; but in 
her heart she fixed a date for the answer by letter, 
and an earlier date for some word by cable ; but she 
feigned that she did not depend upon this ; and when 
no word came she convinced herself that she had not 
expected any. 

It was nearing the end of the term which she had 
tacitly given her lover to make the first sign by letter, 
when one morning Mrs. Lander woke her. She 
wished to say that she had got the strength to leave 
Venice at last, and she was going as soon as their 
trunks could be packed. She had dressed herself, 
and she moved about restless and excited. Clemen 
tina tried to reason her out of her haste ; but she 



 

irritated her, and fixed her in her determination. " I 
want to get away, I tell you ; I want to get away," 
she answered all persuasion, and there seemed some 
thing in her like the wish to escape from more than 
the oppressive environment, though she spoke of 
nothing but the heat and the smell of the canal. " I 
believe it 's that, moa than any one thing, that 's kept 
me sick he e," she said. " I tell you it 's the malariar, 
and you 'll be down, too, if you stay." 

She made Clementina go to the banker s, and get 
money to pay their landlord 's bill, and she gave him 
notice that they were going that afternoon. Clemen 
tina wished to delay till they had seen the vice-consul 
and the doctor ; but Mrs. Lander broke out, " I don 't 
want to see em, either of em. The docta wants to 
keep me he e and make money out of me ; I unda- 
stand him ; and I don 't believe that consul 's a bit too 
good to take a pussentage. Now, don 't you say a 
wo'd to either of etn. If you don 't do exactly what 
I tell you I 'll go away and leave you he e. Now, 
will you?" 

Clementina promised, and broke her word. She 
went to the vice-consul and told him she had broken 
it, and she agreed with him that he had better not 
come unless Mrs. Lander sent for him. The doctor 
promptly imagined the situation and said he would 
come in casually during the morning, so as not to 
alarm the invalid 's suspicions. He owned that Mrs. 
Lander was getting no good from remaining in Venice, and if it were possible for her to go, he said she 
had better go somewhere into cooler and higher air. 



 

His opinion restored him to Mrs. Lander 's esteem, 
when it was expressed to her, and as she was left to 
fix the sum of her debt to him, she made it hand 
somer than anything he had dreamed of. She held 
out against seeing the vice-consul till the landlord 
sent in his account. This was for the whole month 
which she had just entered upon, and it included fan 
tastic charges for things hitherto included in the rent, 
not only for the current month, but for the months 
past when, the landlord explained, he had forgotten 
to note them. Mrs. Lander refused to pay these de 
mands, for they touched her in some of those economies which the gross rich practice amidst their 
profusion. The landlord replied that she could not 
leave his house, either with or without her effects, 
until she had paid. He declared Clementina his prisoner, too, and he would not send for the vice-consul 
at Mrs. Lander 's bidding. How far he was within 
his rights in all this they could not know, but he was 
perhaps himself doubtful, and he consented to let 
them send for the doctor, who, when he came, behaved 
like anything but the steadfast friend that Mrs. Lander supposed she had bought in him. He advised 
paying the account without regard to its justice, as 
the shortest and simplest way out of the trouble ; but 
Mrs. Lander, who saw him talking amicably and even 
respectfully with the landlord, when he ought to have 
treated him as an extortionate scamp, returned to her 
former ill opinion of him ; and the vice-consul now 
appeared the friend that Doctor Tradonico had falsely 
seemed. The doctor consented, in leaving her to her 



 

contempt of him, to carry a message to the vice-consul, though he came back, with his finger at the side 
of his nose, to charge her by no means to betray his 
bold championship to the landlord. 

The vice-consul made none of those shows of 
authority which Mrs. Lander had expected of him. 
She saw him even exchanging the common decencies 
with the landlord, when they met; but in fact it was 
not hard to treat the smiling and courteous rogue 
well. In all their disagreement he had looked as con 
stantly to the comfort of his captives as if they had 
been his chosen guests. He sent Mrs. Lander a much 
needed refreshment at the stormiest moment of her 
indignation, and he deprecated without retort the 
denunciations aimed at him in Italian which did not 
perhaps carry so far as his conscience. The consul 
talked with him in a calm scarcely less shameful than 
that of Dr. Tradonico ; and at the end of their parley 
which she had insisted upon witnessing, he said: 

" Well, Mrs. Lander, you 've  got to stand this gouge 
or you 've  got to stand a law suit. I think the gouge 
would be cheaper in the end. You see, he 's got a 
right to his month 's rent." 

" It ain 't the rent I ca e for : it 's the candles, and 
the suvvice, and the things he says we broke. It 
was undastood that everything was to be in the rent, 
and his two old chaias went to pieces of themselves 
when we tried to pull em out from the wall ; and I 'll 
neva pay for em in the wo ld." 

u Why," the vice-consul pleaded, " it 's only about 
forty francs for the whole thing " 


" I don 't care if it 's only fotty cents. And I must 
say, Mr. Bennam, you 're about the strangest vice-con 
sul, to want me to do it, that I  eva saw." 

The vice-consul laughed unresentfully. " Well, 
shall I send you a lawyer?" 

" No ! " Mrs. Lander retorted ; and after a mo 
ment 's reflection she added, " I 'm goin to stay my 
month, and so you may tell him, and then I 'll see 
whetha he can make me pay for that breakage and 
the candles and suvvice. I 'm all wore out, as it is, 
and I ain 't fit to travel, now, and I don 't know when I 
shall be. Clementina, you can go and tell Maddalena 
to stop packin . Or, no ! Til do it." 

She left the room without further notice of the 
consul, who said ruefully to Clementina, " Well, I 've  
missed my chance, Miss Claxon, but I guess she 's
