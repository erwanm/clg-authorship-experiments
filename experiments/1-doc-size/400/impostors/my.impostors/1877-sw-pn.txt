all. In Hamburg alone there were handed over 



 

from female friends of the Mission, one hundred 
and twenty-eight cotton shirts, all finished and 
ready; from Haide forty striped shirts for the natives ; from Lubeck and Mechlenburg, besides beautiful under-linen, all sorts of pictures and little 
things for the heathen; from some children here 
came writing boxes, pens, and writing books for 
the heathen children. Also from here, from Osnabruck, Schaumburg, Luneburg, Bremen and neighbourhood, whole rolls of linen cloth. There was a 
stir and spring of love that moved people's hearts. 
Every one of the emigrants was to take a guri with 
him, for in East Africa there are a great many wild 
beasts, lions, elephants, serpents, etc. Scarcely had 
this become known, when guns, rifles, double-barrelled rifles, pistols and daggers came in, till we 
had enough to leave some for a future party that 
might be sent out. Then would come our harbour-master, or our captain, from Harburg, to arrange this or that; then our pupils journeyed to 
Harburg to bring money for the ship. One hardly 
knew where his head was.' " 

"Well, did they go to Africa, Ditto ? " 
"The colonists and missionaries; yes, sixteen of 
them." 

" Whereabouts in Africa ? " 

" The east coast, about Natal." 

" I haven't the least idea where Natal is." 

"You would do well to look it out on the map." 

" And are they there yet, Ditto ? " 

" They went in the year 1853. It is not likely 



 

they are all there now. But others followed them, 
Maggie, year after year, till now there are, I believe, 
between twenty and thirty stations where they are 
settled." 

"All from Hermannsburg ! Ditto, it is very 
curious! So many years ago, Hermann's castles 
sent out soldiers to bring heathen Mechlenburg to 
the Christian religion ; and now Mechlenburg gives 
shirts and pictures for Hermannsburg to send to 
other heathen in Africa." 

"What sort of heathen people are those they went 
to ? " Esther asked. 

"Quite a good sort. Here is a description of 
them, written by one of the brethren who sailed in 
that first trip of the ' Caiidace ' : 

" ' I cannot make it out, how the heathen can be 
as they are, although they are day and night before 
my eyes. They are powerful, muscular men, with 
open faces and sparkling eyes; they all go either 
quite naked or with a very slight covering. A late 
law obliges them however to put a shirt on when 
they are going into a city. They live in houses 
which resemble beehives, into which you must 
creep. The whole stock of valuables which you 
find in these huts, is an assaghai (javelin), a club, 
a mat, a bit of wood for a pillow, and a great horn 
for smoking. I have seen nothing else in them. 
The people have almost no wants. So many wives 
as a man has, so many huts has he also, one for 
each wife, and then one besides for himself. The 
women are bought ; paid for with cows and oxen ; 



 

ten or twenty oxen for a wife. These become then 
the man's slaves, and the man, when he has got a 
good many wives, hardly does any more work himself. The women must cultivate the maize and 
sweet potatoes, which is almost all the people live 
upon. Once in a while they kill an ox; and then 
so many come together to eat it that it is all dis 
posed of at one meal. Our German brethren aver 
that ten Caffres in twenty-four hours will eat up a 
whole ox, skin and entrails and all, which they 
roast at the fire ; that afterwards, however, they can 
go fasting four days at hard labour. They are fond 
of adorning themselves with coral and rings, and 
snuif-boxes are to be seen in the hands of both men 
and women. They cork up the snuff in their nos 
trils with a hollowed-out bit of wood, till the tears 
run down their cheeks. The women are so hardly 
used that a mother with a little five-days-old baby 
must go out to work in the hot sun, with the baby 
on her back, and the father does not concern himself at all about the child. Of twins, one is almost 
always killed at once. In short, they are not much 
above the beasts in their way of life ; and the worst 
of all is, they are almost inaccessible to the truth, 
and laugh at everything sacred.' " 



 



CHAPTEK VIII. 

"Well," said Maggie, as Meredith paused, "I 
should think somebody ought to go to those 
people!" 

" Hopeless work," said Flora, stitching away at 
her worsted. 

"No, it is not hopeless work," answered her 
brother. " As you would soon see, if all the churches 
had the matter at heart like Pastor Harms and his 
Hermann sburg. " 

" Everybody cannot give himself up to such business," said Flora glancing at him. 

" Everybody ought." 

" Ditto ! " cried Maggie, " do you think everybody ought to go to Africa ? " 

"Yes," said Flora; "that is just about what he 
thinks." 

" No, Maggie," said Meredith, " neither to Africa 
nor to other heathen parts; not everybody. But 
everybody can give himself up to the work of the 
kingdom, even if he stays at home. Most people 
must stay at home." 



 

" I don't understand," said Maggie with a shrug 
of her shoulders. 

"Don't you remember ' Seek ye first the king 
dom of God ; ' that's all I mean." 

" ' First ! ' " Flora echoed. 

"How 'first,' Ditto?" 

" Before everything else. The words mean that, 
if they mean anything." 

" How before everything else ? " 

" See, Maggie. Suppose you and I have " 

" Now, Ditto, stop ! " said his sister. " I do not 
want to hear any of that stuff. What is it to 
Maggie ? And Essie and I do not care about it." 

"And there comes Fenton," added Esther, springing up to go and meet him. For Fenton it was, 
bounding up the bank at their left. 

Fenton was grown a good deal since our last 
sight of him; otherwise not much changed. A 
handsome boy, with a good figure and a bright eye, 
and also the old, somewhat supercilious upper lip. 
But he was glad to get home, and greeted the 
party cordially enough. Then, however, began to 
criticise. 

"What are you all doing, loafing here?" He 
had sat down on the bank with the rest, and looked 
from one to another. 

" We do not use your elegant expression," said 
Flora ; " partly perhaps because we are not wont to 
indulge ourselves in that particular amusement." 

"What are you doing?" 

" You do not see anything to engage our attention, in what at present offers itself to yours," Mer 
edith remarked. 

" Nothing offers itself to my attention," replied 
Fenton. "I don't see anything! except our old cart. 
Anything to eat in it ? " 

"There is no pie left," said Esther, "for I gave 
the last of it to Fairbairn; and Flora drank up all 
the cream. There's some sugar in the sugar-bowl." 

Fenton went to get some lumps of sugar, and 
then stood looking down at the party : 

"Aren't you going home to dinner ? " said he. " I 
tell you, I'm raging." 

"Four o'clock," said Meredith, looking at his 
watch. "Just the pretty time of day coming 
now." 

" It'll be dinner-time, by the time you get the 
cart home, and the girls get dressed. What did 
you come out here so far for ? I haven't had a respectable dinner for six months. I am going to 
have some wine to-day, if the governor is away." 

" Governor ! " cried Esther. " What a vulgar expression ! For Fenton Candlish to use ! " 

" Wine ! " exclaimed Maggie. " You can't have 
any wine, Fenton; we don't drink wine any more 
in this house." 

" What's the matter ! " 

" The matter is, papa has emptied his wine cellar," said Esther in a rather aggrieved tone. 

" Drunk it all up ? " 

" No, no; sent it off and sold it." 

" What was the matter with it ! " 



 

"Why I tell you," said Esther; "it is thought 
improper for good people to drink wine." 

Fenton's face was rather funny to see, there was 
such a blank dismay in it. 

"And did mamma give in to that?" 

" I don't know what mamma thought," said Esther; "but papa sold the wine; and our dinner- 
'table does not have its pretty coloured glasses any 
more." 

Fen ton uttered a smothered exclamation which 
I am afraid would have shocked his sisters. 

" I don't see what you want with wine, Fenton !" 
said Maggie; "papa never let you have it." 

"Mamma did though," said Fenton. "That's the 
good of having two parents. If one is crochetty 
perhaps the other will be straight. Well, I'm not 
going to live if I can't live like a gentleman. I 
shall send to Forbes to send me some wine." 

His sisters burst out into horrified exclamations 
and expostulations. 

" Papa'll see it in the bill," said Esther, " and 
he'll be very angry." 

"Uncle Eden is coming," said Maggie, "and it 
will be no use. He'd throw it into the river." 

" Uncle Eden coming ? " 

The girls nodded. 

"If I had known that, /wouldn't have come!" 
said Fenton looking very dark. 

"I'd think better of it if I were you," remarked 
Meredith quietly. "There goes more to the making 
of a gentleman than the drinking of wine." 



 

" What do you mean ? " 

"Just that. As for instance self-control, noble 
thoughts, care for others above himself, indifference 
to low pleasures." 

"Low pleasures!" repeated Fenton. "Do you 
call wine a low pleasure ? " 

" Well it brings people into the gutter." 

" Pshaw ! not gentlemen." 

" I grant you they are not gentlemen after they 
get there." 

"What do you know about it?" said the boy not 
very politely. " Did you ever drink it yourself? " 

" I never will again. A gentleman should be a 
free man; and wine makes men slaves. I don't 
choose to be in bondage. And if it would not en 
slave me, it does other people; and I would not 
give it the help of my example." 

Fenton dropped the subject, but renewed his proposal that they should return home. So shawls and 
worsted work were stored in the cart, and the little book in Meredith's pocket; and the line of 
march was taken up. It was indeed coming now 
to the lovely time of the day. Shadows long, lights 
glowing in warm level reflections, all objects get 
ting a sunny side and a shade side and standing 
forth in new beauty in consequence; the day gath 
ering its train, as it were, to prepare for a stately 
leave-taking by and by. Meredith and Maggie, 
loath to go, lingered the last of the party; indeed 
he had the cart to draw, which was heavy, and 
needed careful guiding in places over and between 




 

the rocks; and he could not run on with the heads 
of the party. And Maggie walked beside him, 
and put her little hand upon the handle of the cart 
which she could not help to draw. How sweet it 
was ! The light every moment growing softer, not 
cooler; the colours more contrasted, as the shadows 
lengthened; the bugle notes coming over the water 
now and then. Meredith looked, and drew deep 
breaths of the delicious air; but Maggie walked 
along pondering. 

"Ditto," she began, "do you think everybody 
ought to do mission work ? " 

" The dear Lord did not give the charge to some 
of his people, did he ? " 

"But how can they do it? Everybody cannot 
go to the heathen ? " 

" He said, ' in all the world ' so that means at 
home as well as abroad, doesn't it?" 

" Preach the Gospel in all the world ? " 

" Yes." 

" How can I, Ditto ? " 

" You and I, let us say. Well, Maggie, suppose 
we ask Mr. Murray? But one thing is certain; 
those who stay at home must furnish the money for 
those that go." 

" Does it take a great deal? " 

" Not to send a few. But how long would feio 
people be, about telling the Gospel to all the world ? 
Suppose one man had as much as the whole state 
of New York, for his parish ? " 

" He'd never get through." 



 

" Exactly. And so it is nearly nineteen hundred 
years since the Lord gave the command; and the 
heathen world is the heathen world still pretty 
much." 

" But then, Ditto to send a great many people, 
it would want a great deal of money?" 

" It does. What then ? " 

"Maybe people cannot afford it." 

" Let us ask Mr. Murray about that." 

" But Ditto, what do you think ? I know you 
think something." 

" Maggie, I think we should seek first the kingdom." 

They were turning into the shrubbery grounds 
near the house, and Maggie left the discussion. 
They were all ready for dinner, as far as appetite 
went, and in a little while the five young people 
sat down at the board. 

" This is jolly," said Fenton, who took the head 
of the table. 

" Roast-beef, to wit ? " said Meredith.
