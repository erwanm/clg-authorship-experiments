"I will try it for a month; then, if it still 
pleases Mrs. Welden, I will make an offer." 

Wicks, the Alert, the Indefatigable, 
sighed and looked down. Actually at the 
moment he was in agony. The unexpected 
and magnificent fish that had so providentially come into his net was wriggling unarrestably away. The commission on a 
month's rental was all on which he could 
surely count. 

Conscious, however, that he must make 
some reply, with an effort he rallied. 

"I don't know," he said, "that the owner 
would care to rent the property. But if 
price seems " 

Welden, standing there supple and smil 
ing, cut him short. 





"I never argue." 

After all, Wicks had immediately reflected, the property was worth certainly a 
thousand a month to any one who could 
be induced to pay it. At ten per cent, that 
meant a hundred for him, with the chance 
still of the bigger commission. 

"Very good, sir," he had replied. "I will 
assume the responsibility." 

In this manner the business had been tem 
porarily concluded. On the premises was 
a lame ostler, who was Irish; a minute gardener, who was Japanese; a half-breed man 
of all work and an obese negro cook. These 
the Weldens retained, reinforcing them 
with servants of their own and with others 
recruited from Los Angeles preparations 
which seemed to postulate permanency if 
signs and portents might. But Wicks 
could be sure of nothing, nor was he, until 
this radiant forenoon, when the crumpler 
nearly occurred, and Welden, damning the 
brute, dismounted. 



 

It was then, reddening with emotion, that 
these anterior events were recalled, for now, 
at last, the fish, the magnificent fish, was 
landed. 

"No, certainly not, we won't burden you 
with him," he replied in answer to Welden's 
protest. "If you will take a seat in my of 
fice for a moment, I will leave him at the 
livery across the way." 

Pleasurably, a hand on the bridle, he led 
the horse off. The netting of the fish meant 
at seven and a half per cent., which was 
the commission agreed in the event of the 
top figure being reached eleven hundred 
and twenty-five dollars. It was certainly 
a very radiant forenoon. 

Welden, meanwhile, flicking still at his 
boots, strolled into the office and sat down on 
one of the three chairs which the place contained. On the wall was a map. Beneath 
was a pulpit desk, high and narrow. On it 
were documents, a china cat, other things 
as well, but most noticeably, a telephone, 


which, as Welden seated himself, began ringing. 

Welden, still flicking at his boots, stared 
aimlessly about. On one of the other chairs 
was the local sheet ; he reached for it and was 
looking over the news of the day when 
Wicks reappeared. 

"Excuse me," said the agent, who went 
to the telephone, which had continued to 
ring. 

Welden but glanced at him. He had just 
read that the New York Central had de 
creased its dividend. The item was of in 
terest; he happened to be a stockholder and 
mentally he began on a calculation which 
Wicks, his hand on the receiver, interrupted. 

"It's for you. Your man, I think. He 
wants to speak to you." 

Absently Welden looked up. "Non 
sense," he presently remarked. "Harris 
knows better than that. If there is any message, though, tell them to give it to you." 



 

Then, after fumbling in a pocket, he got 
out a gold pencil with which he jotted figures on the margin of the paper that he held. 
But the operation did not prevent him from 
hearing. 

"Yes," Wicks was saying. "Mr. Weiden is here. Mr. Welden says you are to 
tell me for him. He What !" 

At the "What," which was not a query, 
but an exclamation, Welden replaced the 
gold top on the pencil and putting it back in 
his pocket, turned again to the news. 

Before him Wicks stood, the receiver at 
his ear, a hand pendent at his side. It was 
shaking a little. 

The motion, odd in itself, attracted Welden. His eyes roamed slowly upward from 
it to the agent's face. Wicks was standing 
now, his inouth half open, looking limply 
at him. 

Welden tossed the paper aside. 

"Are you ill?" 





Wicks closed his mouth, shook his head, 
then partly opened his mouth again. But 
still he did not speak. 

Welden stood up. "Are you?" he repeat 
ed. 

Then finally Wicks did speak. "Your 
wife!" he said slowly, and hanging the receiver up, flopped into a chair. 

The nightmare that had overspread the 
land was battening individually on him. 
Through it the face of the grocer peered. 
With the grocer was the mortgagee. Both 
were throwing him and his out on the country road. That indeed might yet occur. At 
the moment, however, he was but being 
shaken, not roughly, but authoritatively, 
from a form of mental swoon. 

"What is this about Mrs. Welden? 
Why the devil don't you tell me? Is she 
ill?" 

Wicks, the Alert and Indefatigable, 
could but nod in reply. 



 

"Very?" Welden persisted. "Come, 
damnation, don't keep me questioning you 
like this. What did they say?" 

The winded Wicks now had got his breath. 
He straightened himself, and rising from the 
chair, put a hand on Welden's arm. 

"She is " And Wicks raised his eyes. 

"Not dead!" cried Welden, starting back. 

Wicks moved nearer and with that sym 
pathy which, in certain crises, one human 
being will always show to another, said lowly: 

"Mr. Welden, they tell me that this lady 
has been killed." 

"Killed!" Welden, again starting back, 
repeated; "but how?" 

Then the detail, passably gruesome, was . 
produced. 

"They found her in bed, her throat cut 
from ear to ear." 



II 

THE INQUEST 

Astride the brute on which ten minutes 
before the crumpler had nearly occurred, 
Welden tore down the street, galloped along 
the ocean boulevard, and on, into a scarlet 
lane, at the end of which stood White Peacocks. 

The entrance was a bit beyond. Rather 
than make the brief circuit, he cleared a 
hedge, raced through the grounds and flung 
himself off at the steps of the verandah. 

In the hall, through the open door, he had 
a glimpse of servants huddled together, and 
of a woman, her face to the wall, whimper 
ing like a frightened cur. 

On the floor above, at the head of the 
stairs, a man of the unmistakable domestic 
type stood uncertainly. 



 

Welden pointed below. "Send those 
people where they belong." 

Hurrying by, he wrenched open a door 
which he closed behind him. When presently that door reopened, he looked older; not 
white, but worn. 

As before, at the head of the stair, the 
man was standing. Welden motioned him 
into another room, one wainscotted with 
bookless bookcases, from which two windows 
gave on the sea. 

Through one of them Welden looked, 
though certainly it was not the sea that he 
saw. After a moment he turned. The man 
was standing by a table, his hands hanging 
at his sides. In and out of the palms the 
fingers moved, regularly, mechanically, perhaps unconsciously. 

"Harris, close the door." 

The man obeyed. 

Welden added: "Tell me everything." 

"It was my wife, sir, Perkins. She was 





taking in the tray with the breakfast things, 
and when she saw, she let it fall and ran out 
and called to me, and I telephoned to Mr. 
Wickses." 

"Have any of you any idea who did it?" 

"No, sir, but" 

"But what?" 

"Thinking as how you would wish it, I 
telephoned to the police." 

Welden nodded. "I told Wicks to. They 
will be here shortly. Fetch some brandy and 
soda." 

Harris turned. He was reopening the 
door when, through the windows, came the 
whirr of a motor, the sound of voices, the 
shuffle of feet. 

"If that is the police," said Welden, "send 
them here." 

From an oblong silver box that lay on the 
table he took a cigarette. While he was 
lighting it Harris reappeared. Accompanying him was a large man with small eyes, a 



 

deformed stomach and a red moustache. As 
he entered he looked Welden over. 

"I m Chief of Police," he announced. 
"Right off I want" 

But Welden, accustomed to give orders 
and not at all to receive them, cut him short. 

"Harris, show the way. Do whatever 
is required. The brandy and soda can 
wait." 

In a little, however, the liquor was forthcoming. 

"There are two of them, sir, besides the 
chief," Harris volunteered, placing, as he 
spoke, the bottles on the table. "And the 
coroner is here." 

Welden, who had seated himself, took another cigarette. Through the windows 
came the savour of salt, the scent of flowers ; 
there came, too, the bark of a dog, caught 
up and repeated. The forenoon was departing in perfect clarity and, save for an occasional footfall, save, too, for an indistinct 





murmur of voices, in a peace that was per 
fect as well. 

Shortly the silence was stirred. There 
came a rap at the door. Before Welden 
could answer, it opened. The chief entered. 
With him was a little man, with smoke- 
coloured glasses and a suit of leprous brown. 

Closing the door, the officer indicated his 
companion. "This here is Dr. Quizen- 
berry, the coroner. We're goin to ask some 
questions." 

"Sit down," said Welden. "Will you 
drink anything?" 

The chief accepted, but the coroner refused. Welden filled a tumbler which he 
gave to the former. 

He drank it noisily. "Nasty business," 
he muttered. "Damn nasty." Wiping his 
mouth and drawing a chair, he seated himself in front of Welden. "When did you 
last see yer wife?" 

"A moment before you got here. You 



 

probably mean, though, when did I last see 
her alive. That was at midnight." 

"Nothin unusual been goin on?" 

"Nothing." 

The chief gnawed moodily at a finger nail. 
His thoughts were few and slow. He was 
assisting at their laborious accouchement. 
Presently, delivered of one, he looked suspiciously at it and from it to Welden. 

"You and yer wife had separate rooms?" 

Welden nodded. 

"The man out there showed me yours, it's 
on the other side of the house." 

Again Welden nodded. 

"Durin the night you heard nothin ?" 

"Nothing whatever. But in regard to my 
domestic arrangements you may have no 
ticed that in this house there are but two 
sleeping porches, one abutting from my 
room, the other from Mrs. Welden's. I 
have been in California before and when here 
I prefer to sleep in the open air. Mrs. Wei- 





den had not accustomed herself to it, though 
naturally she slept with the windows open." 
"That's right," said Dr. Quizenherry, 
"and with the screen door to the porch unfastened. Anybody could have climbed 



in."
