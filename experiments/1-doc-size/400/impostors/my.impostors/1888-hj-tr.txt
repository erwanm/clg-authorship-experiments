grown up together (her people had been friends 
of his grandfather when that fine old Southern 
worthy came, a widower with a young son and 
several negroes, to take his pleasure in Paris in 
the time of Louis Philippe), and how much she 
had had to do with marrying his sisters. He was 
not ignorant that her friendship and all its 
exertions were often mentioned as explaining 
their position, so remarkable in a society in which 
they had begun after all as outsiders. But he 
would have guessed, even if he had not been told, 
what his father said to that. To offer the Proberts 
a position was to carry water to the fountain ; they 
had not left their own behind them in Carolina ; 
it had been large enough to stretch across the 
sea. As to what it was in Carolina there was no 
need of being explicit. This adoptive Parisian was 
by nature presupposing, but he was admirably gentle 
(that was why they let him talk to them before 
the fire lie was such a sympathising oracle), and 
after the death of his wife and of Mme. de 
Marignac, who had been her friend too, he was 
gentler than before. Gaston had been able to see 
that it made him care less for everything (except 
indeed the true faith, to which he drew still closer), 
and this increase of indifference doubtless helped 
to explain his collapse in relation to common 
Americans. 

" We shall be thankful for any rooms you will 
give us," the young man said. " We shall fill 
out the house a little, and won 't that be rather 
an improvement, shrunken as you and I have 
become ? " 

" You will fill it out a good deal, I suppose, with 
Mr. Dossori and the other girl." 

"Ah, Francie won 't give up her father and 
sister, certainly; and what should you think of 
her if she did ? But they are not intrusive ; they 
are essentially modest people ; they won 't put 
themselves upon us. They have great natural 
discretion." 

" Do you answer for that ? Susan does ; she is 
always assuring one of it," Mr. Probert said. 
" The father has so much that he wouldn 't even 
speak to me." 

" He didn 't know what to say to you." 


" How then shall I know what to say to him ? " 

" Ah, you always know ! " Gaston exclaimed. 

"How will that help us if he doesn 't know 
what to answer ? " 

" You will draw him out he is full of bonhomie" 

" Well, I won 't quarrel with your lonlwmmc (if 
he s silent there are much worse faults), nor even 
with the fat young lady, though she is evidently 
vulgar. It is not for ourselves I am afraid ; it s 
for them. They will be very unhappy." 

" Never, never ! " said Gaston. " They are too 
simple. They are not morbid. And don 't you 
like Francie ? You haven 't told me so," he added 
in a moment. 

" She says Par us, my dear boy." 

"Ah, to Susan too that seemed the principal 
obstacle. But she has got over it. I mean Susan 
has got over the obstacle. We shall make her 
speak French; she has a capital disposition for 
it ; her French is already almost as good as her 
English." 

" That oughtn 't to be difficult. What will you 
have ? Of course she is very pretty and I'm sure 
she is good. But I won 't tell you she is a marvel, 
because you must remember (you young fellows 
think your own point of view and your own expe 
rience everything), that I have seen beauties with 
out number. I have known the most charming 
women of our time women of an order to which 
Miss Francie, con rispctto parlando, will never 





begin to belong. I'm difficult about women how 
can I help it ? Therefore when you pick up a little 
American girl at an inn and bring her to us as a 
miracle, I feel how standards alter. J ai vu mieux 
que $a, mon clier. However, I accept everything 
to-day, as you know ; when once one has lost one s 
enthusiasm everything is the same, and one might 
as well perish by the sword as by famine." 

" I hoped she would fascinate you on the spot," 
Gaston remarked, rather ruefully. 

" Fascinate the language you fellows use ! " 

" Well, she will yet." 

" She will never know at least that she doesn 't : 
I will promise you that," said Mr. Probert. 

"Ah, be sincere with her, father she s worth 
it ! " his son broke out. 

When the old gentleman took that tone, the 
tone of vast experience and a fastidiousness justi 
fied by ineffable recollections, Gaston was more 
provoked than he could say, though he was also 
considerably amused, for he had a good while since 
made up his mind that there was an element of 
stupidity in it. It was fatuous to square one s 
self so serenely in the absence of a sense : so far 
from being fine it was gross not to feel Francie 
Dosson. He thanked God he did. He didn 't 
know what old frumps his father might have fre 
quented (the style of 1830, with long curls in 
front, a vapid simper, a Scotch plaid dress and a 
body, in a point suggestive of twenty whalebones, 
coming down to the knees), but he could remem 
ber Mme, de Marignac s Tuesdays and Thursdays 
and Fridays, with Sundays and other days thrown 
in, and the taste that prevailed in that milieu : 
the books they admired, the verses they read and 
recited, the pictures, great heaven ! they thought 
good, and the three busts of the lady of the house, 
in different corners (as a Diana, a Druidess and a 
Croyante : her shoulders were supposed to make up 
for her head), effigies which to-day even the least 
bad, Canova s would draw down a public casti- 
gation upon their authors. 

" And what else is she worth ? " Mr. Probert 
asked, after a momentary hesitation. 

" How do you mean, what else ? " 

" Her immense prospects, that s what Susan has 
been putting forward. Susan s insistence on them 
was mainly what brought over Jane. Do you 
mind my speaking of them ? " 

Gaston was obliged to recognise, privately, the 
importance of Jane s having been brought over, 
but he hated to hear it spoken of as if he were 
under an obligation to it. " To whom, sir ? " he 
asked. 

" Oh, only to you." 

" You can 't do less than Mr. Dosson. As I told 
you, he waived the question of money and he was 
superb. We can 't be more mercenary than he." 

" He waived the question of his own, you mean ? : 
said Mr. Probert, 





"Yes, and of yours. But it will be all right 
The young man flattered himself that that was as 
far as he was willing to go, in the way of bribery. 

" Well, it s your affair or your sisters  his 
father returned. " It s their idea that it will be 
all right." 

" I should think they would be weary of chat 
tering ! " Gaston exclaimed, impatiently. 

Mr. Probert looked at him a moment with a 
vague surprise, but he only said, " I think they 
are. But the period of discussion is over. We 
have taken the jump." He added, in a moment, 
as if from the desire to say something more con 
ciliatory : " Alphonse and Maxime are quite of 
your opinion." 

" Of my opinion ? " 

" That she is charming." 

" Confound them, then, I'm not of theirs ! " 
The form of this rejoinder was childishly perverse, 
and it made Mr. Probert stare again ; but it be 
longed to one of the reasons for which his children 
regarded him as an old darling that Gaston could 
feel after an instant that he comprehended it. 
The old man said nothing, but took up his book, 
and his son, who had been standing before the fire, 
went out of the room. His abstention from pro 
test at Gaston s petulance was the more commend 
able as he was capable, for his part, of thinking it 
important that ccs messieurs should like the little 
girl at the hotel. Gaston was not, and it would 
have seemed to him a proof that he was in servi 
tude indeed if he had accepted such an assurance 
as that as if it mattered. This was especially the 
case as his father s mention of the approval of 
two of his brothers-in-law appeared to point to a 
possible disapproval on the part of the third. 
Francie s lover cared as little whether she dis 
pleased M. de Brecourt as he cared whether she 
displeased Maxime and Kaoul. The old gentleman 
continued to read, and in a few moments Gaston 
cam e back. He had expressed surprise, j ust before, 
that his sisters should have found so much to dis 
cuss in the idea of his marriage, but he looked at 
his father now with an air of having more to say 
an intimation that the subject must not be con 
sidered as exhausted. " It seems rather odd to 
me that you should all appear to accept the step 
I am about to take as a sort of disagreeable neces 
sity, when I myself hold that I have been so 
exceedingly fortunate." 

Mr. Probert lowered his book accommodatingly 
and rested his eyes upon the fire. "You won 't 
be content till we are enthusiastic. She seems a 
good girl certainly, and in that you are fortunate." 

" I don 't think you can tell me what would be 
better what you would have preferred," said the 
young man. 

" What I would have preferred ? In the first 
place you must remember that I was not madly 
impatient to see you married." 

" I can imagine that, and yet I can 't imagine 
that, as things have turned out, you shouldn 't be 
struck with the felicity. To get something so 
charming, and to get it of our own species." 

" Of our own species ? Tudieu ! " said Mr. 
Probert looking up. 

" Surely it is infinitely fresher and more amusing 
for me to marry an American. There s a dreari 
ness in the way we have Gallicised." 

"Against Americans I have nothing to say; 
some of them are the best thing the world contains. 
That s precisely why one can choose. They are 
far from being all like that." 

"Like what, dear father?" 

" Comma ces gens-Id. You know that if they 
were French, being otherwise what they are, 
one wouldn 't look at them." 

" Indeed one would ; they would be such 
curiosities." 

" Well, perhaps they are sufficiently so as it is," 
said Mr. Probert, with a little conclusive sigh. 

" Yes, let them pass for that. They will surprise 
you." 

" Not too much, I hope ! " cried the old man, 
opening his volume again. 

It will doubtless not startle the reader to learn 
that the complexity of things among the Proberts 
was such as to make it impossible for Gaston to 
proceed to the celebration of his nuptials, with 
all the needful circumstances of material preparation 
and social support, before some three months 
should have expired. He chafed however but 
moderately at the delay, for he reflected that it 
would give Francie time to endear herself to his 
whole circle. It would also have advantages for 
the Dossons; it would enable them to establish 
by simple but effective arts the modus mvendi 
with that rigid body. It would in short help 
every one to get used to everything. Mr. Dosson s 
designs and Delia s took no articulate form ; what 
was mainly clear to Gaston was that his future 
wife s relatives had as yet no sense of disconnec 
tion. He knew that Mr. Dosson would do what 
ever Delia liked and that Delia would like to 
" start " her sister. Whether or no she expected 
to be present at the finish, she had a definite 
purpose of seeing the beginning of the race. Mr. 
Probert notified Mr. Dosson of what he proposed 
to " do " for his son, and Mr. Dosson appeared 
more amused than anything else at the news. 
He announced, in return, no intentions in regard 
to Francie, and his queer silence was the cause 
of another convocation of the house of Probert. 
Here Mme. de Brecourt s valorous spirit won an 
other victory ; she maintained, as she informed her 
brother, that there was no possible policy but a 
policy of confidence. " Lord help us, is that what 
they call confidence ? " the young man exclaimed, 
o-uessing the way they all looked at each other; 
and he wondered how they would look next at 
poor Mr. Dosson. Fortunately he could always fall 
back, for reassurance, upon that revelation of their 
perfect manners ; though indeed he thoroughly 
knew that on the day they should really attempt 
interference make a row which might render 
him helpless and culminate in a rupture their 
courtesy would show its finest flower. 

Mr. Probert s property was altogether in the 
United States : he resembled various other persons 
to whom American impressions are mainly accept 
able in the form of dividends. The manner in 
which he desired to benefit his son on the occasion 
of the latter s marriage rendered certain visitations 
and reinvestments necessary in that country. It 
had long been his conviction that his affairs needed 
looking into; they had gone on for years and 
years without an overhauling. He had thought 
of going back to see, but now he was too old and 
too tired and the effort was impossible. There was 
nothing for it but for Gaston to go, and go quickly, 
though the moment was rather awkward. The idea 
was communicated to him and the necessity ac 
cepted ; then the plan was relinquished : it seemed 
such a pity he should not wait till after his marriage, 
when he would be able to take Francie with 
him. Francie would be such an introducer. This 
postponement would have taken effect had it not 
suddenly come out that Mr. Dosson himself wanted 
to go for a few weeks, in consequence of some 
news (it was a matter of business), that he had un- 





expectedly received. It was further revealed that 
that course presented difficulties, for he could not 
leave his daughters alone, especially in such a 
situation. Not only would such a proceeding 
have given scandal to the Proberts, but Gaston 
learned, with a good deal of surprise and not a 
little amusement, that Delia, in consequence of 
peculiar changes now wrought in her view of 
things, would have felt herself obliged to protest 
on the score of propriety. He called her 
attention to the fact that nothing would be more 
simple than, in the interval, for Francie to go 
and stay with Susan or Margaret ; Delia herself in 
that case would be free to accompany her father. 
But this young lady declared that nothing would 
induce her to quit the European continent until she 
had seen her sister through, and Gaston shrank 
from proposing that she too should spend five weeks 
in the Place Beauvau or the Rue de Lille. 
Moreover he was startled, he was a good deal 
mystified, by the perverse, unsociable way in which 
Francie asserted that, as yet, she would not lend 
herself to any staying. After, if he liked, but 
not till then. And she would not at the moment 
give the reasons of her refusal ; it was only very 
positive and even quite passionate. 

All this left her intended no alternative but 
to say to Mr. Dosson, " I am not such a fool as 
I look. If you will coach me properly, and trust 
me, I will rush across and transact your business 





as well as my father s." Strange as it appeared, 

Francie could resign herself to this separation 

from her lover it would last six or seven weeks 

rather than accept the hospitality of his 

sisters. Mr. Dosson trusted him; he said to him, 

&lt; Well, sir, you've  got a big brain," at the end of 

a morning they spent with papers and pencils;
