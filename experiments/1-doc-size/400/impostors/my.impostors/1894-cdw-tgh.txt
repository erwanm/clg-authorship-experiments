but not always sober. 

One day he read the announcement that Mrs. 
Rodney Henderson and Miss Tavish had sailed for 
Europe. That ended that chapter. What exactly 





he had expected he could not say. Help from Car- 
men ? Certainly not. But there had never been a 
sign from her, nor any word from Mavick lately. 
There evidently was nothing. He had been thrown 
over. Carmen evidently had no more use for him. 
She had other plans. The thought that he had 
been used and duped was almost more bitter than 
his loss. 

In after-days Jack looked back upon this time 
with a feeling akin to thankfulness for Carmen's 
utter heartlessness in regard to his affairs. He 
trembled to think what might have happened to 
him if she had sent for him and consulted him and 
drawn him again into the fatal embrace of her 
schemes and her fascinations. Now he was sim- 
ply enraged when he thought of her, and irritated 
with himself. 

These were dark days, days to which he looked 
back with a shudder. He wrote to Edith frequent- 
ly a brief note. He was straightening out his af- 
fairs ; he was busy. But he did not give her his 
address, and he only got her letters when the Ma- 
jor forwarded them from the club, which was ir- 
regularly. A stranger, who met him at his lodg- 
ings or elsewhere, would have said that he was an 
idle and rather dissipated-looking man. He was 
idle, except in his feeble efforts to get work ; he 
was worn and discouraged, but he was not doing 
anything very bad. In his way of looking at it, 





he was carrying out his notion of honor. He was 
only breaking a woman's heart. 

He was conscious of little except his own mis- 
fortunes and misery. He did not yet apprehend 
his own selfishness nor her nobility. He did not 
yet comprehend the unselfishness of a good wom- 
an's love. 

On the East Side one day, as he was sauntering 
along Grand Street, he encountered Dr. Leigh, his 
wife's friend, whom he had seen once at his house. 
She did not at first recognize him until he stopped 
and spoke his name. 

"Oh," she said, with surprise at seeing him. 
and at his appearance, " I didn't expect to see you 
here. I thought everybody had gone from the 
city. Perhaps you are going to the Neighborhood 
Guild?" 

" IS"o," and Jack forced a little laugh, " I'm not 
so good as that. I'm kept in town on business. I 
strolled over here to see how the other side of life 
looks." 

" It doesn't improve. It is one of the worst sum- 
mers I ever saw. Since Mr. Henderson's death 

" What difference did Henderson's death make 
over here ?" 

" Why, he had deposited a little fund for Father 
Damon to draw on, and the day after his death the 
bank returned a small check with the notice that 
there was no deposit to draw on. It had been such 



a help in extraordinary cases. Perhaps you saw 
some allusion to it in the newspapers ?" 

" Wasn't it the Margaret Fund ?" 

" Yes. Father Damon dropped a note to Mrs. 
Henderson explaining about it. No reply came." 

" As he might have expected." Dr. Leigh looked 
up quickly as if for an explanation, but Jack ig- 
nored the query, and went on. " And Father Da- 
mon, is he as active as ever ?" 

" He has gone." 

" What, left the city, quit his work ? And the 
mission ?" 

" I don't suppose he will ever quit his work while 
he lives, but he is much broken down. The mission 
chapel is not closed, but a poor woman told me 
that it seemed so." 

" And he will not return ? Mrs. Delancy will be 
so sorry." 

" I think not. He is in retreat now, and I heard 
that he might go to Baltimore. I thought of your 
wife. She was so interested in his work. Is she 
well this summer ?" 

" Yes, thank you," said Jack, and they parted. 
But as she went on her way his altered appearance 
struck her anew, and she wondered what had hap- 
pened. 

This meeting with Mr. Delancy recalled most 
forcibly Edith, her interest in the East Side work, 
her sympathy with Father Damon and the mission, 





the first flush of those days of enthusiasm. "When 
Father Damon began his work the ladies used to 
come in their carriages to the little chapel with 
flowers and money and hearts full of sympathy 
with the devoted priest. Alone of all these Edith 
had been faithful in her visits, always, when she 
was in town. And now the whole glittering show 
of charity had vanished for the time, and Father 
Damon 

The little doctor stopped, consulted a memoran- 
dum in her hand-bag, looked up at the tenement- 
house she was passing, and then began to climb its 
rickety stairway. 

Yes, Father Damon had gone, and Kuth Leigh 
simply went on with her work as before. Perhaps 
in all the city that summer there was no other per- 
son whose daily life was so little changed as hers. 
Others were driven away by the heat, by tempora- 
ry weariness, by the need of a vacation and change 
of scene. Some charities and some clubs and 
schools were temporarily suspended ; other chari- 
ties, befitting the name, were more active, the very 
young children were most looked after, and the 
Good Samaritans of the Fresh -Air Funds went 
about everywhere full of this new enthusiasm of 
humanity. But the occupation of Ruth Leigh re- 
mained always the same, in a faithful pertinacity 
that nothing could wholly discourage, in a routine 
that no projects could kindle into rnuclfenthusiasm. 





Day after day she went about among the sick and 
the poor, relieving and counselling individuals, and 
tiring herself out in that personal service, and more 
and more conscious, when she had time, at night, 
for instance, to think, of the monstrous injustice 
somewhere, and at times in a mood of fierce revolt 
against the social order that made all this misery 
possible and hopeless. 

Yet a great change had come into her life the 
greatest that can come to any man or woman in 
the natural order. She loved and she was loved. 
An ideal light had been cast upon her common- 
place existence, the depths of her own nature had 
been revealed to herself. In this illuminating 
light she walked about in the misery of this world. 
This love must be denied, this longing of the heart 
for companionship could never be gratified, yet 
after all it was a sweet self-sacrifice, and the love 
itself brought its own consolation. She had not to 
think of herself as weak, and neither was her lov- 
er's image dimmed to her by any surrender of his 
own principle or his own ideal. She saw him, as 
she had first seen him, a person consecrated and 
set apart, however much she might disagree with 
his supernatural vagaries set apart to the service 
of humanity. She had bitter thoughts sometimes 
of the world, and bitter thoughts of the false 
system that controlled his conduct, but never of 
him. 







It was unavoidable that she should recall her 
last interview with him, and that the image of his 
noble, spiritual face should be ever distinct in her 
mind. And there was even a certain comfort in 
this recollection. 

Father Damon had indeed striven, under the 
counsel of his own courage and of Brother Monies, 
to conquer himself on the field of his temptation. 
Bat with his frail physique it was asking too much. 
This at last was so evident that the good brother 
advised him, and the advice was in the nature of a 
command in his order, to retire for a while, and 
then take up his work in a fresh field. 

When this was determined on, his desire was 
nearly irresistible to see Kuth Leigh ; he thought it 
would be cowardly to disappear and not say good- 
by. Indeed, it was necessary to see her and ex- 
plain the stoppage of help from the Margaret 
Fund. The check that he had drawn, which was 
returned, had been for one of Dr. Leigh's cases. 
With his failure to elicit any response from Mrs. 
Henderson, the hope, raised by the newspaper 
comments on the unexecuted will, that the fund 
would be renewed was dissipated. 

In the interview which Father Damon sought 
with Dr. Leigh at the Women's Hospital all this 
was explained, and ways and means were discussed 
for help elsewhere. 

" I wanted to talk this over with you," said Fa- 







ther Damon, " because I am going away to take a 
rest." 

"You need it, Father Damon," was Ruth's an- 
swer, in a professional manner. 

"And and," he continued, Tvith some hesita- 
tion, " probably I shall not return to this mission." 

" Perhaps that will be best," she said, simply, 
but looking up at him now, with a face full of ten- 
der sympathy. 

" I am sure of it," he replied, turning away from 
her gaze. " The fact is, doctor, I am a little 
hipped overworked, and all that. I shall pull 
myself together with a little rest. But I wanted 
to tell you how much I appreciate } T our work, and 
and what a comfort you have been to me in my 
poor labors. I used to hope that some time you 
would see this world in relation to the other, 
and" 

" Yes, I know," she interrupted, hastily, " I can- 
not think as you do, but " And she could not go 
on for a great lump in her throat. Involuntarily 
she rose from her seat. The interview was too 
trying. Father Damon rose also. There was a 
moment's painful silence as they looked in each 
other's faces. Neither could trust the voice for 
speech. He took her hand and pressed it, and 
said " God bless you !" and went out, closing the 
door softly. 

A moment after he opened it again and stood 





on the threshold. She was in her chair, her head 
bowed upon her arms on the table. As he spoke 
she looked up, and she never forgot the expression 
of his face. 

"I want to say, Kuth" he had never before 
called her by her first name, and his accent thrilled 
her " that I shall pray for you as I pray for my- 
self, and though I may never see you again in this 
world, the greatest happiness that can come to me 
in this life will be to hear that you have learned to 
say Our Father which art in heaven." 

As she looked he was gone, and his last words re- 
mained a refrain in her mind that evening and af- 
terwards " Our Father which art in heaven " a 
refrain recurring again and again in all her life, in- 
separable from the memory of the man she loved. 






CHAPTER XXII 

ALONG the Long Island coast lay the haze of 
early autumn. It was the time of lassitude. In 
the season of ripening and decay Nature seemed 
to have lost her spring, and lay in a sort of deli- 
cious languor. Sea and shore were in a kind of 
truce, and the ocean south wind brought cool re- 
freshment but no incentive. 

From the sea the old brown farm-house seemed 
a snug haven of refuge ; from the inland road it 
appeared, with its spreading, sloping roofs, like an 
ancient sea-craft come ashore, which had been, 
covered in and then embowered by kindly Nat- 
ure with foliage. In those days its golden-brown 
color was in harmony with the ripening orchards 
and gardens. 

Surely, if anywhere in the world, peace was 
here. But to its owner this very peace and quiet- 
ness was becoming intolerable. The waiting days 
were so long, the sleepless nights of uncertainty 
were so weary. When her work was done, and 
Edith sat with a book or some sewing under the 
arbor where the grape clusters hung, growing dark 
and transparent, and the boy played about near 



her, she had a view of the blue sea, and about her 
were the twitter of birds and the hum of the cica- 
da. The very beauty made her heart ache. Sea- 
ward there was nothing nothing but the leap- 
ing little waves and the sky. From the land side 
help might come at any hour, and at every roll of 
wheels along the road her heart beat faster and 
hope sprang up anew. But day after day noth- 
ing came. 

Perhaps there is no greater bravery than this 
sort of waiting, doing the daily duty and waiting. 
Endurance is woman's bravery, and Edith was en- 
during, with an almost broken but still with a cou- 
rageous heart. It was all so strange. Was it sim- 
ply shame that kept him away, or had he ceased to 
love her? If the latter, there was no help for her. 
She had begged him to come, she had offered to 
leave the boy with her cousin companion and go 
to him. Perhaps it was pride only. In one of his 
short letters he had said, " Thank God, your little 
fortune is untouched." If it were pride only, how 
could she overcome it ? Of this she thought night 
and day. She thought, and she was restless, fever- 
ish, and growing thin in her abiding anxiety. 

It was true that her own fortune was safe and 
In her control. But with the usual instinct of 
women who know they have an income not likely 
to be ever increased, she began to be economical. 
She thought not of herself, but of the boy. It was 



the boy's fortune now. She began to look sharply 
after expenses; she reduced her household; she 
took upon herself the care of the boy, and other 
household duties. This was all well for her, for it 
occupied her time, and to some extent diverted her 
thoughts. 

So the summer passed a summer of anxiety, 
longing, and dull pain for Edith. The time came 
when the uncertainty of it could no longer be en- 
dured. If Jack had deserted her, even if he should 
die, she could order her life and try to adjust her 
heavy burden. But this uncertainty was quite be- 
yond her power to sustain. 

She made up her mind that she would go to the 
city and seek him. It was what he had written 
that she must not on any account do, but nothing 
that could happen to her there could be so bad as 
this suspense. Perhaps she could bring him back. 
If he refused, and was angry at her interference, 
that even would be something definite. And then 
she had carefully thought out another plan. It 
might fail, but some action had now become for 
her a necessity. 

Early one morning it was in September she 
prepared for a journey to the city. This little trip, 
which thousands of people made daily, took on for 
her the air of an adventure. She had been im-
