transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake, 
in spite of every effort to the contrary ; and St. Clare, after 
all his promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these 
mistakes, calling Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to 
amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending 
passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia's remonstrances. 

" How do you think I can do anything with the child, if 
you will go on so, Augustine ? " she would say. 

" Well, it is too bad ; I won't again ; but I do like to hear 
the droll little image stumble over those big words ! " 

" But you confirm her in the wrong way." 

" What's the odds ? One word is as good as another to her." 





" You wanted me to bring her up right ; and you ought 
to remember she is a reasonable creature, and be careful of 
your influence over her." 

" Oh, dismal ! so I ought ; but, as Topsy herself says, I's 
so wicked ! " 

In very much this way Topsy 's training proceeded, for a 
year or two Miss Ophelia worrying herself from day to day 
with her, as a kind of chronic plague, to whose inflictions 
she became, in time, as accustomed as persons sometimes do 
to the neuralgia or sick-headache. 

St. Clare took the same kind of amusement in the child 
that a man might in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer. 
Topsy, whenever her sins brought her into disgrace in other 
quarters, always took refuge behind his chair ; and St. Clare, 
in one way or other, would make peace for her. From him 
she got many a stray picayune, which she laid out in nuts 
and candies, and distributed, with careless generosity, to all 
the children in the family ; for Topsy, to do her justice, was 
good-natured and liberal, and only spiteful in self-defence. 
She is fairly introduced into our corps de ballet, and will 
figure from time to time, in her turn, with other performers. 



CHAPTEE XXI. 

KENTUCK. 

OUR readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a 
brief interval, at Uncle Tom's Cabin, on the Kentucky farm, 
and see what has been transpiring among those whom he 
had left behind. 

It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and 
windows of the large parlour all stood open, to invite any 
stray breeze that might feel in a good humour to enter. 
Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and 
running through the whole length of the house to a balcony 
on either end. Leisurely tipped back in one chair, with his 
heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. 
Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing ; 





she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which 
she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. 
, "Do you know," she said, " that Chloe has had a letter 
from Tom?" 

" Ah ! has she ? Tom's got some friend there, it seems. 
How is the old boy ?" 

" He has been bought by a very fine family, I should 
think," said Mrs. Shelby; "is kindly treated, and has not 
much to do." 

" Ah ! well, I'm glad of it very glad," said Mr. Shelby, 
heartily. " Tom, I suppose, will get reconciled to a 
southern residence hardly want to come up here again." 

" On the contrary, he inquires very anxiously," said 
Mrs. Shelby, " when the money for his redemption is to be 
raised." 

" I'm sure I don't know," said Mr. Shelby. " Once get 
business running wrong, there does seem to be no end to it. 
It's like jumping from one bog to another, all through a 
swamp ; borrow of one to pay another, and then borrow of 
another to pay one and these confounded notes falling due 
before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round 
dunning letters and dunning messages all scamper and 
hurry-scurry." 

" It does seem to me, my dear, that something might be 
done to straighten matters. Suppose we sell off all the- 
horses, and sell one of your farms, and pay up 
square ?" 

" Oh ! ridiculous, Emily ! You are the finest woman in 
Kentucky, but still you haven't sense to know that you 
don't understand business ; women never do, and never- 
can." 

" But, at least," said Mrs. Shelby, " could you not give' 
me some little insight into yours ? a list of all your debts, 
at least, and of all that is owed to you, and let me try and 
see if I can't help you to economise." 

" Oh, bother ! don't plague me, Emily ! I can't tell 
exactly. I know somewhere about what things are likely to 
be ; but there's no trimming and squaring my affairs, as 
Chloe trims crust off her pies. You don't know anything 
about business, I tell you." 

And Mr. Shelby, not knowing any other way of enforcing 






his ideas, raised his voice; a mode of arguing very convenient and convincing, when a gentleman is discussing 
matters of business with his wife. 

Mrs. Shelby ceased talking, with something of a sigh. The 
fact was, that though, as her husband had stated, she was a 
woman, she had a clear, energetic, practical mind, and a 
force of character every way superior to that of her husband; 
so that it would not have been so very absurd a supposition 
to have allowed her capable of managing, as Mr. Shelby 
supposed. Her heart was set on performing her promise 
to Tom and Aunt Chloe, and she sighed a-s discouragements 
thickened around her. 

"Don't you think we might, in some way, contrive to 
raise that money ? Poor Aunt Chloe ! her heart is so set 
on it !" 

" I'm sorry if it is. I think I was premature in promising. 
I'm not sure, now, but it's the best way to tell Chloe, and 
let her make up her mind to it. Tom'll have another wife 
in a year or two, and she had better take up with somebody 
else." 

" Mr. Shelby, I have taught my people that their mar- 
riages are as sacred as ours. I never could think of giving 
Chloe such advice." 

" It's a pity, wife, that you have burdened them with a 
morality above their condition and prospects. I always 
thought so." 

" It's only the morality of the Bible, Mr. Shelby." 

"Well, well, Emily, I don't pretend to interfere with 
your religious notions, only they seem extremely unfitted 
for people in that condition." 

" They are, indeed," said Mrs. Shelby ; " and that is why, 
from my soul, I hate the whole thing. I tell you, my dear, 
I cannot absolve myself from the promises I make to these 
helpless creatures. If I can get the money no other way, I 
will take music scholars ; I could get enough, I know, and 
earn the money myself." 

" You wouldn't degrade yourself that way, Emily ? I never 
could consent to it." 

" Degrade ! would it degrade me as much as to break my 
faith with the helpless ? No, indeed !" 

" Well, you are always heroic and transcendental," said 





Mr. Shelby, " but I think you had better think before you. 
undertake such a piece of Quixotism." 

Here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance 
of Aunt Chloe, at the end of the verandah. 

" If you please, missis " said she. 

" Well, Chloe, what is it ? " said her mistress, rising, and 
going to the end of the balcony. 

"If missis would come and look at dis yer lot o' 
poetry." 

Chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry, an 
application of language in which she always persisted, not- 
withstanding frequent corrections and advisings from the 
young members of the family. 

" La sakes !" she would say, " I can't see ; one jis good as 
turrer, poetry suthin' good, any how ;" and so poetry Chloe 
continued to call it. 

Mrs. Shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens 
and ducks, over which Chloe stood, with a very grave face of 
consideration. 

"I'm a thinkin' whether missis would be a havin' a 
chicken pie o' dese yer." 

" Eeally, Aunt Chloe, I don't much care ; serve them any 
way you like." 

Chloe stood handling them over abstractedly  it was quite 
evident that the chickens were not what she was thinking 
of. At last, with the short laugh with which her tribe often 
introduce a doubtful proposal, she said 

" Laws me, missis, what should mas'r and missis be a 
troublin' theirselves 'bout de money, and not a usin' what's 
right in der hands ?" and Chloe laughed again. 

"I don't understand you, Chloe," said Mrs. Shelby, 
nothing doubting, from her knowledge of Chloe's manner, 
that she had heard every word of the conversation that had 
passed between her and her husband. 

"Why, laws me, missis!" said Chloe, laughing again, 
" other folks hires out der niggers, and makes money on 
'em ! Don't keep sich a tribe eatin' 'em out of house and 
home." 

" Well, Chloe, who do you propose that we should hire 

" Laws ! I ain't a proposin' nothin' ; only Sam he said 


der was one of dese yer perfectioners, dey calls 'em, in 
Louisville, said he wanted a good hand at cake and 




try, and said he'd give four dollars a-week to one, he 

"Veil, Chloe?" 

" "Well, laws, I's a thinkin', missis, it's time Sally was put 
along to be doin' something. Sally's been under my care, 
now, dis some time, and she does most as well as me, con- 
siderin' ; and if missis would only let me go, I would help 
fetch up de money. I an't afraid to put my cake, nor pies 
nother, long side no perfectioner's" 

" Confectioner's, Chloe." 

" Law sakes, missis ! 't an't no odds ; words is so curis, 
can't never get 'em right!" 

" But, Chloe, do you want to leave your children ?" 

" Laws, missis ! de boys is big enough to do day's 
works ; dey does well enough ; and Sally, she'll take de 
baby she's such a peart young un, she won't take no 
lookin' arter." 

" Louisville is a good way off." 

" Law sakes ! who's afeard ? it's down river, somer near 
my old man, perhaps ?" said Chloe, speaking the last in the 
tone of a question, and looking at Mrs. Shelby. 

" No, Chloe ; it's many a hundred miles off," said Mrs. 
Shelby. 

Chloe's countenance fell. 

" Never mind ; your going there shall bring you nearer, 
Chloe. Yes, you may go ; and your wages shall every 
cent of them be laid aside for your husband's redemp- 
tion." 

As when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver, so 
Chloe's dark face brightened immediately ; it really shone. 

" Laws ! if missis is'nt too good ! I was thinking of dat 
ar very thing ; cause I shouldn't need no clothes, nor shoes, 
nor nothin'. I could save every cent. How many weeks is 
der in a yer, missis ? " 

" Fifty-two," said Mrs. Shelby. 

" Laws ! now, dere is ? and four dollars for each on 'em. 
"Why, how much dat ar be ?" 

"Two hundred and eight dollars," said Mrs. Shelby. 

" "Why-e " said Chloe, with an accent of surprise and 





delight ; " and how long would it take me to work it out, 
missis ? " 

" Some four or five years, Chloe ; but then you needn't do 
it all, I shall add something to it." 

"I wouldn't hear to missis' givin' lessons nor nothin'. 

hope none our family eyer be brought to dat ar, while I's 
got hands." 

" Don't fear, Chloe ; I'll take care of the honour of the 
family," said Mrs. Shelby, smiling. "But when do you 
expect to go ?" 

" Well, I warn't spectin' nothin'; only Sam, he's a gwine 
to de river with some colts, and he said I could go 'long 
with him ; so I jest put my things together. If missis was 
willin' I'd go with Sam to-morrow mornin', if missis would 
write my pass, and write me a commendation." 

" "Well, Chloe, I'll attend to it, if Mr. Shelby has no 
objections. I must speak to him." 

Mrs. Shelby went up stairs, and Aunt Chloe, delighted, 
went out to her cabin, to make her preparation. 

"Law sakes, Mas'r George! ye didn't knowJ's a gwine 
to Louisville to-morrow!" she said to George, as, entering 
her cabin, he found her busy in sorting over her baby's 
clothes. "I thought I'd jist look over Sis's things, and get 
'em straightened up. But I'm gwine, Mas'r George gwine 
to have four dollars a- week ; and missis is gwine to lay it all 
up, to buy back my old man agin ! " 

" Whew ! " said George, " here's a stroke of business, to 
be sure ! How are you going ?" 

" To-morrow, wid'Sarn. And now Mas'r George, I knows 
you'll jist sit down and write to my old man, and tell him all 
about it won't ye ?" 

" To be sure," said George ; " Uncle Tom '11 be right glad 
to hear from us. I'll go right in the house for paper and 
ink ; and then, you know, Aunt Chloe, I can tell about the 
new colts and all." 

" Sartin, sartin, Mas'r George ; you go 'long, and I'll get 
ye up a bit o' chicken, or some sich : ye won't have many 
more suppers wid your poor old aunty." 




CHAPTEE XXII. 

"THE GRASS WITHERETH THE FLOWER FADETH." 

LIFE passes with us all, a day at a time ; so it passed 
with our friend Tom, till two years were gone. Though 
parted from ail his soul held dear, and though often yearning 
for what lay beyond, still was he never positively and con- 
sciously miserable ; for, so well is the harp of human feeling 
strung, that nothing but a crash that breaks every string 
can wholly mar its harmony ; and, on looking back to seasons 
which in review appear to us as those of deprivation and 
trial, we can remember that each hour, as it glided, brought 
its diversions and alleviations, so that, though not happy 
wholly, we were not, either, wholly miserable. 

Tom read, in his only literary cabinet, of one who had 
" learned, in whatsoever state he was, therewith to be content.' It seemed to him good and reasonable doctrine, and 
accorded well with the settled and thoughtful habit which 
he had acquired from the reading of that same book. 

His letter homeward, as we related in the last chapter, 
was in due time answered by Master G-eorge, in a good, 
round, schoolboy hand, that Tom said might be read " most 
acrost the room." It contained various refreshing items of 
home intelligence, with which our reader is fully acquainted ; 
stated how Aunt Chloe had been hired out to a confectioner 
in Louisville, where her skill in the pastry line was gaining 
wonderful sums of money, all of which, Tom was informed, 
was to be laid up to go to make up the sum of his redemption money ; Mose and Pete were thriving, and the baby 
was trotting all about the house, under the care of Sally and 
the family generally. 

Tom's cabin was shut up for the present; but George 
expatiated brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be 
made to it when Tom came back. 

The rest of this letter gave a list of George's school
