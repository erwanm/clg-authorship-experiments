And our pleasant path may lie 
Where the stream of affection flows along, 

In the light of a summer sky; 
But woe for the lights that early wane, 

And the shades that early fall, 
And the prayer that speaks f the secret pain, 

Though its voice be still and small. 

FRANCES BROWN. 

THE head of the family ! This was what Richard Bertrand 
thought, as he sat in his room, weary, and yet wakeful. 
What a change a week had wrought ! Then he had been 
musing over such visions as young men are wont to dream 
of; a girlish wife and baby faces growing up in his house- 
hold, whose helpless, clinging touches give to parents wisdom 
and patience. Instead, ties not his very own sprang up to 
fetter him with a double chain of love and duty. It was not 
such a care-free path as those rambles over the old world, 
with his chosen wife beside him. What wonder if he 
glanced at that lost way with sorrowful tenderness ? Already 
cares and sacrifices began to stare him in the face. Could 
he make his position harmonize with his affection ? The lit- 
tle scene with Robert told him he had not a parent's author- 
ity, and that his rule must be one of love. A fine sense of 
honor ran like a silver chord through his nature, and he felt 
it would be right for him to pay off this mortgage with his 
own fortune, no matter how overstrained the action might 
appear to others. His father had behaved with scrupulous 
generosity and delicacy in never mentioning the fact of his 
having indorsed for Richard's uncle, and it touched him tc 



 

the heart. Yes, be would clear the house from debt, and 
then some provision must be made for the family. His 
father's practice was extensive ; he would doubtless succeed 
to a large share of it. If he could keep them all together 
for a few years ! And then thoughts of Ada arose. Would 
she be happy here ? 

I think it was well Sunday came in the midst of their grief. 
It sanctified it, and added a tender solemnity to the memory 
of the dead, and gave Richard his true position at once the 
place he was to fill through years of mingled joy and sorrow. 
He took his father's seat in the church with a feeling of grave 
awe, and those who looked upon his manly figure and truth- 
ful face, prophesied it would be worthily filled. 

He hesitated a little whether he should go to Ada that 
night, then decided to remain at home. They could not 
sing, as was their usual custom ; but Richard read to them : 
afterwards they fell into a sweet, sorrowful talk of him who 
had gone from their midst, and was keeping the eternal rest 
that remained for the people of God. 

" ' A day which shall be known unto the Lord, not day, nor 
night ; but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall 
be light,' " Mabel said, with her lingering good-night kiss. 

" At evening time," Richard repeated. He did not dream 
then how often he should have need to comfort himself with 
the words. 

Monday morning brought the stir of busy life. Robert 
was called into conference with his brother, and all immedi- 
ate plans laid before him. There was a sad parting with the 
girls, and Richard drove him to the depot, offering a few 
brotherly suggestions that were received with an attentive 
air. But a feeling of intense relief came in his face when he 
found himself alone ; and he said, almost audibly, 

" Dick is a good fellow, and I must be careful. Wasn't I 
lucky to make my peace with the learned and reverend fac- 
ulty ? Suspension just now would have been well, it 
didn't come, thanks to fortune ; so there's no use of borrow- 
ing trouble." 





Then followed aunt Sophia's departure. It was natural 
she should feel anxious for the children's welfare, as their 
mother had been her only sister ; and she offered to take the 
two younger ones, in case they decided to break up the 
household. 

" You are to be married soon, I believe ? " she said to 
Richard. 

" Not until fall, and I may remain here then. It is 
my wish to keep the family together. I think father de- 
sired it." 

She could not object to this ; but as Mrs. Hall helped her 
put on her wrappings, the subject was re-discussed. 

" I'm afraid it Avill not work," she said, slowly. " Mabel 
is growing up, and may want to te mistress in her own house, 
and Miss Townley won't fe.el disposed to accept of the second 
position. Then, he is only their half-brother, and we can- 
not expect him to give up all to them. Poor things, they 
will never find another friend like their father ! " 

Mrs. Hall sighed and hoped it would end rightly, but was 
a little doubtful of two families living in perfect peace, when 
both would have such a strong claim on "Mr. Richard." 

The next event in order was the mortgage. Mr. Grailford 
was a little surprised at Richard's proposal, but simply said, 
"I hope you have considered the matter well;" and then 
went about the business in his ordinary manner. Some days 
elapsed before it could be finally settled ; but when Richard 
had freed the house from its encumbrance, and placed a 
thousand dollars in the lawyer's hands to Robert's credit, a 
great weight seemed to have fallen from him. Now the 
question of retrenchment must be seriously considered. 

This was a difficult subject for a young man. The house 
was large, to be sure, yet it was all needed ; and it was not 
possible to do with less than the three servants : Mrs. Hall, 
a sensible, middle-aged woman, who had filled the post of 
housekeeper since Mrs. Bertrand's death, and was a most 
excellent manager; Ann, the maid of all work, a good- 



 

natured Irish woman, whose tastes were certainly promiscuous 
as regarded employment. As a girl she had served appren- 
ticeship to Mrs. Bertrand, married, and after a brief essay at 
housekeeping, had come back during the illness of her mis- 
tress. Her husband having been taken as coachman and 
gardener, Martin and Ann Burns might well be considered 
fixtures. Martin was especially valuable, if he did grumble a 
little now and then, for he was sober, honest, and industrious. 
None of the servants could be dispensed with while the family 
remained here. 

And to go away ! It sent a quick pang to Richard's heart. 
Dr. Bertrand had come here after his second marriage, and 
this was the scene of Richard's boyish years, as well as his 
thoughtful, happy manhood. He could remember every im- 
provement, and how he had sometimes assisted in planning. 
The house was situated at the northern end of the city, in a 
quiet, shady street, whose sidewalk was bordered with patri- 
archal elms. The grounds, though small, were tastefully laid 
out, a handsome court-yard in front, with miniature lawns, 
whose dark green Norway pines made a pleasant gloom. 
The house was double, the pointing roofs over the dormer 
windows relieving its squareness. To the right, partially 
hidden by trees, stood the carriage-house and barn. The 
rear commanded a lovely prospect. It lay on the banks of the 
Passaic, the slope terraced by a series of steps, the upper 
ones being devoted to flowers, and the lower to fruit and 
vegetables ; ending by a thick stone wall at the water's edge. 
Here was the boat-house, whose building Richard had super- 
intended, and he could almost feel the thrill of delight with 
which he had welcomed the dainty "Jessie," his boat. Here 
were fruit trees he had trained, rose-cuttings bestowed by 
friends, and a host of flowers he had taken delight in culti- 
vating. Then the rooms ! there was not a nook or corner 
but held some pleasant memory for him ; all had been hal- 
lowed by the presence of that dear father. No, he could 
never willingly go away. 



 

He summoned Mrs. Hall, and they took a review of the 
housekeeping department. He found his father had sup- 
plied every thing with a most lavish hand, and that Mrs. Hall 
thought an important reform might be commenced here. She 
lingered after they had arranged their plans, her face so 
plainly showing something left unsaid, that he asked, with a 
pleasant smile, 

" Are there any more suggestions ? I am a new hand at 
the business, you know, and will take the least hint kindly." 

The little woman's face flushed, and she said, quite hum- 
My, 

" I should like to speak of one thing, if you wouldn't be 
oifended, sir. It's not my place ; but I've seen more of life 
than you, women's lives, I mean, their likes and wants, 
and sometimes little jealous feelings that make a household 
miserable. People who love dearly do not always know just 
how to make each other happy. If it isn't too bold a ques- 
tion, wasn't you thinking of being married, and bringing 
your wife here ? " 

" I did think about it; in the fall, perhaps ; " and Richard's 
color rose a trifle. 

" What I wanted to say, Dr. Richard, was this. Miss 
Townley, being the youngest of her family, and having such 
a fortune, never has had anything to try her patience, or 
any feelings or wishes beside her own to consult. I dare 
say she loves you very much, and looks forward to a happy 
life with you, thinking, like most young creatures, that the 
highest joy is having you all her own. And here are the 
children, very fond of you, and used to having their father all 
to themselves, for he was always thinking what he could do 
for them, and was so indulgent, so patient, with their little 
tempers and rare disputes. Now they all cling to you ; in- 
deed, you are filling their father's place ; but when a new 
claimant for your love comes " 

" You are afraid there might be some trouble," he said ; 
in the calm tone of a man who felt certain of perfect accord, 



 

" It's right and natural fen- a wife who loves her husband 
beyond all else, to wish to be first with him to want all his 
leisure hours. No one could blame her for it. But the 
children would have to be put off, and might feel neg- 
lected. A restraint would come hard at first ; they're so 
affectionate, and were used to so much freedom with their 
father. It's trying to a man, when he loves both parties ; 
and it's difficult for both parties to agree, when they look at 
the same thing in a different light. You'd be the shield, 
with one .side gold, and the other side silver." 

" Well," said Richard, cheerfully, " how shall I keep the 
peace ? " 

" I can't answer that, sir. But if you tried the plan and 
found it did not prove agreeable, I was thinking, how much 
pleasanter than sending them among strangers it would be 
to hire a cheap little cottage, and let me take charge of them. 
I could do all the work, and make them happy, I think, and 
you could watch over them. When I remember how much I 
owe your dear father, I feel as if I ought to spend my very 
life for his children's happiness. He came to me when my 
husband lay dying,and my poor baby too ill to go out of my 
arms, while I was almost wild with poverty and anxiety. 
 I can never forget his goodness, and how he comforted 
me after they were gone, when I came near dying with lone- 
liness and grief myself. I feel as if I daren't meet him in 
heaven, unless I do all I can for his ; " and Mrs. Hall broke 
down in a sobbing fit. 

Richard was moved to the heart. He took her hand 
kindly, and said, in a voice of emotion, 

'' How much I thank you for this generous offer, I cannot 
put in words. I honor you, too, for so practical a plan ; and 
if the time should ever come when such a division seems 
necessary, I shall gladly avail myself of your suggestions. 
Believe me, I am eager to do my whole duty by them ; they 
were my father's last charge." 

" I hope you'll pardon me if I've been over-bold, but I 





couldn't bear to think of their being separated while they're 
so young. Miss Mabel will grow up a sort of mother to the 
rest, and I know we can make a pleasant home. They have 
so few relatives that they'll always cling together. Their 
aunt'Sophia would do anything ia the world for them, but 
she has such a large family." 

" If my plan will not work, we must try yours," he said, 
kindly. 

After Mrs. Hall had left him, he dropped his forehead on 
his hand, and fell into a reverie. How many difficulties rose 
in his path ! More than once some slight incident had made 
him feel his actions would be more severely criticised because 
he was a half brother to the rest. The suspicions that had 
been scarcely suggested, wounded his keenly sensitive soul. 
He understood how this home, delightful as it was, might 
not be so happy for Ada. He would be compelled to divide 
his attentions. There were lessons, little troubles, and much 
demonstrative love, that he could only check by positive cold- 
ness. How could he teach Tessy the first kiss did not be- 
long to her ? Would he wish to estrange them ? 

No, indeed ; he loved them too well ;- and he resolved, 
come what would, to keep, in the truest manner possible, his 
promise to his dead father. If Mrs. Hall hardly dared meet 
him in heaven, with an unperformed kindness between them, 
how much more he, a well-beloved son, in ^whorn his father 
reposed the highest confidence ! 

Yet it would take the most entire devotion to repay Ada 
for her disappointment in not going abroad. It was her 
right to have some voice in a matter that so deeply concerned 
herself. Suppose she should not wish to come and share 
her husband's time and love with so many. She was rather 
exacting. He had hitherto liked the jealous regard that 
could not spare a word nor caress. But how would it an- 
swer when they all came to live together ? 

A rush of children through the hall dispersed his troubled 
thoughts, and he rose to meet them. Fresh from school, 



 

with rosy faces, and somewhat boisterous greetings Archie 
begging for a little help in his Latin, Lily petitioning for a 
ride on Saturday ; and Tessy, clasping his arm with both 
eager hands, hopped beside him, intent on studying locomo- 
tion on one foot. 

Mabel's voice sounded from the hall above, 

" Come, children, the dinner bell will ring in five minutes, 
and you are not ready." 

Lily went up the steps two at a time, and Archie made 
noisy attempts at imitating her. Richard swung Tessy with 
a sudden force, landing her three steps up. She gave a gay 
little laugh, and said, in a delighted tone, 

" Dick ! you're as strong as papa ; he used to do 
that ! " 



 



CHAPTER V. 

All as God wills, who wisely heeds 

To give or to withhold, 
And knowcth more of all my needs 

Than all my prayers have told. 

WHITTIER. 

Two months had elapsed since Dr. Bertrand's death. 
Changeful childhood rallied and grasped eagerly at the 
pleasures of life, in order to fill up the chasm of loss. Merry 
laughs once more woke echoes through the quiet house, and 
occasionally Lilian broke into a bird-like song. Richard had 
been very busy. His father's patients had poured in upon 
him in numbers that could not fail to be gratifying ; yet it 
rendered the prospect of a long absence unfortunate for his 
position as a doctor, if not absolutely impossible. The new 
cares and responsibilities had somewhat broken in upon his 
devotedness as a lover, though his betrothed had consoled 
herself with a visit to New York for gayeties she could not 
well ask Richard to share at home. She had been kind and 
sympathizing, and borne her share of the grief tranquilly. 
Still he was anxious for a -more thorough understanding of 
their future. 

One lovely May evening they went out for a walk. He 
had a purpose in this, for he wanted to be beyond the chance 
of interruption. The night air was fragrant with the breath 
of young trees, and the varied odors of spring. The soft 
blue sky, with its tender stars, seemed to have a peculiar 
nearness to human hearts and human wants. The tremulous 
air brought vague memories of lost joys, dreams unrealized 
and forgotten, save in such, hours. 



 

" How beautiful ! " and Richard paused. They had turned 
into High Street, and gaining a little eminence, the whole 
city lay at their very -feet, softened in a flood of silver light, 
serene as if all in those homes were perfect peace. 

" Yes," Ada answered slowly ; " but think, Richard, what 
such a night would be in Venice with the songs of gondoliers, 
or roaming through the palace gardens of the old world. I 
am longing for fields of olive and figs, and where purple grapes 
glisten in the long reaches of a still fairer light than this." 

" It would disappoint you very, very much not to go ? " 
His voice had a touch of winning gentleness in it. 

" O, I must ! You know what I said about waiting ! By 
fall you will surely have all family arrangements completed."
