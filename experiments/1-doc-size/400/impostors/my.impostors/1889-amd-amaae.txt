dred and twenty dollars. So that now my fortune 
amounted to $2,247. I began to feel quite like a 
nabob. 

We advanced our lad's wages to six dollars a 
week. Our coal had been put in: our autumnal 
work was pretty well done. In such a business, there 
always remains plenty of work, but we had resolved 
not to let one season's duties lap over into another. 
And in view of what was to occupy a part of this 
month, we thought it would not be wisdom to fall 
behind. 

We found that we had nearly quadrupled our 
stock. Our four houses were as full as they could 
be crowded with regard to the well-being of our 
favorites. Our roses were in a splendid condition. 
We had kept on raising new ones, and now and 
then developed an unexpected variety through some 
queer freak of nature. 

I must say a word here about my young peach- 
trees. I had now two rows of twenty each that 
would come into fine bearing another year. We had 
from them all about five bushels of peaches this year, 
and we could count on considerable profit. My black 
berries I had set along the Myrtle-avenue fence. 
Some few might be taken by officious hands, but 
there would be an abundance left. They had grown 




tremendously, and would fruit finely another sum 
mer. It seemed to me that we could count on a 
clear income of over a thousand dollars apiece next 
year. I could afford to throw up the station, and 
sent in my resignation to take effect the 1st of Octo 
ber. I received a very kindly note in reply, the 
business at Athens, passenger, freight, and expressing, 
had increased so much, that they regretted losing so 
honest and efficient a man. They would therefore 
advance my salary to sixty dollars a month. 

Who shall say after this that corporations have no 
souls ? 

I explained that I had entered a more profitable 
and agreeable business, and thanked them for their 
generous offer. I could afford to retire from railroad 
ing, unless at some future time I should be elected 
director or president. Yet I looked around the old 
station and the little office with a pang of curious 
regret. There had been many hours of happiness 
within its walls. 

An old friend that I had known on a Western 
road came to hand, a Frank Tracy who had 
passed through quite a career. He had been married 
and divorced. His wife was somewhere, taking 
care of two children ; and he was a jolly, im 
provident fellow of two and thirty, without money 
enough to bury him when he died. Socially he was 



 

not likely to come much within our circle, for our 
pleasures would have bored him. He drank a little, 
not to excess, played billiards and pool, and did some 
betting on horses in the season. In three months' 
time there had been so many complaints that he was 
removed, and the thing tried over with a rather worn- 
out married man of forty, whose wife came to live 
over the station. But it was not such romantic 
living as ours had been. 

" I suppose," said Joe, " if some one had told me 
three years ago that I might succeed you at the sta 
tion, and earn fifty dollars a month, it would have 
lifted me clear off my feet. And here I am on the 
high road to a fair competence, with the sweetest 
wife in the world and the finest baby, all because you 
hammered enough common sense into my head to see 
that it was better and happier by far to have some 
thing of one's own, instead of handing it over to a 
saloon-keeper. If there was half the anxiety that 
the poor man should have a home of his own that is 
displayed in inducing him to drink beer and rum, 
how much better off the world would be ! There 
certainly will be a good deal to answer for at the last. 
And I am not sure but it will one day become one of 
the big factors in political economy." 

I think Joe is right. I am not a bigot. But when 



 

we talk of raising our fellow-creatures by education 
and art and a love of beauty, let us not drag them 
down with the other hand into blighting tempta 
tions. 




CHAPTER XXII 

WEDDING BELLS 

" AND they were married, and lived happily ever 
afterward." I suppose that is the orthodox ending 
or beginning. Little did I imagine that Eve and I 
would find our fate and fortune in a small, sleepy, 
old-time country-town. But we had startled it out 
of its hundred-year nap, which, perhaps, has been 
better than " painting it red." 

I fancy that a man's idea of marriage is, oftenest, 
going off quietly, and, like Mr. Wemmick, stepping 
in to be married, finding every thing ready with no 
fuss. But well, Lawrence and I were in a manner 
patriots, and were ready to be sacrificed for our 
country. 

It would have been a great disappointment to the 
Athenians, and to our own little circle as well, if we 
had not taken them into account. First of all, 
Gordon Pryor announced that the bridal feast, in 
whatever shape it was given, was solely his affair. 
Then, a double wedding was rather out of the 



 

ordinary. And there were so many friends 
consequently, there was no resource but to resign 
ourselves to fate. 

It seemed to me that Harwood House overflowed 
with guests. Many of Eve's girl-friends came over, 
married now, of course, but one eould not forbid 
them hotel privileges, even if one had felt ever so 
hermit-like. The Hildreth cousins came on from 
Philadelphia ; at least, three of them did, two 
bright girls, and a very delightful young man. 
There were three more who were heads of families. 

We were married in church at seven in the even 
ing. The church was almost a garden of flowers. 
Mr. Wilbur gave away both brides. Mr. Bradford 
performed the ceremony with the kind of tender 
solemnity that goes to one's heart. We were con 
voyed back to the hotel, which was fragrant with 
flowers also ; and 

" The feast was set, 
The guests were met." 

For two hours we enjoyed it all. We were not 
bored, we were not surfeited with good wishes ; and 
we did appreciate the love and kindness and the 
enduring friendship, for some of it had been tried. 
At nine o'clock, Celia and I said good-by to the 
circle, and went out to try the new life by ourselves. 



 

Lawrence and Eve had so willed it, since we could 
not both go away. 

Where we went, it matters not. It was strange 
and new and sweet to have Celia all to myself. I 
saw visions through her artistic eyes. We planned 
out our lives, as I suppose all newly wedded lovers 
do. But the crowning delight of all, was belonging 
to each other. We had been sensible lovers, we had 
license now to be as foolish as we listed. I do not 
even think we were troubled about the opinion of 
those we met, whether or not they considered us 
newly married. It was a delightful, leisurely holi 
day in the glorious old autumn. 

We ended in Philadelphia one Friday evening, 
expecting to reach Athens the next night; but, lo! 
the hospitable Hildreths, aided and abetted by Eve 
and Lawrence, had planned otherwise. They two 
were to come on Saturday evening, and we were all 
to return on Monday. 

There were many things to see that day ; but I 
obeyed Lawrence's behest, and visited his favorite 
greenhouses. Seven acres under glass was flower- 
farming on a large scale. It appeared to me that we 
were viewing all the beauty and bloom of the whole 
world. Ours was a sort of child's playhouse com 
pared to it; and the well-informed, courteous pro 
prietors were delightful men to spend hours with. 



 

Many new ideas and suggestions presented them 
selves to my mind ; but I found that, in the main, 
we were making our time count profitably. It is 
reaching a result in the best possible manner that is 
the test: the amount of time spent upon it is not 
the basis of a correct estimate. If the day should 
ever come when each man can do the work for 
which he is best fitted, and for which he has a love, 
for the two things must go together to make a 
success, there will be a great improvement in the 
productions of the world, and, perhaps, the inhabit 
ants thereof. 

We had a most enjoyable day, and at nine in the 
evening Lawrence and Eve made their appearance. 
The greenhouses had been left to the care of Joe 
and our young lad, who was progressing finely, 
being born to the business. How curiously fasci 
nating Eve looked ! I could not help watching her. 
The Hildreths were quite bewitched, especially the 
young man ; and I ought not omit uncle Jared, a 
fine specimen of the half-Quaker school, whose 
" thees " had the endearing German sound when he 
used them. 

A heavenly Sunday it was, but all days were 
transcendent. I was so glad to have Eve and Law 
rence once more, and Celia's happiness was as fer 
vent. Eve would always be the more brilliant, of 



 

course ; and the added grace and dignity of marriage 
imparted something quite indescribable. And just 
here I ought to say that a New-York paper gave us 
quite a grand "send-off" on the occasion of our 
marriage, calling Eve a " beautiful society-girl well 
known in the city," and Celia " one of our talented 
young artists," and bringing Harwood House, as 
well as Athens, into prominent notice. 

Still, it was very pleasant to come back home. 
There were warm welcomes on every hand : even 
the very flowers seemed eloquent. Joe's greeting, 
I think, touched me the most of all. 

" I'm glad you are fast here," he added, between 
smiles and tears; "for if you went to any new 
place, I should pack up and follow. I don't know 
why, Thurston, but it just seems as if I could not 
stay in any place that didn't hold you." 

"We are likely, all of us, to be fixtures," I re 
plied cheerfully; "and I haven't seen many places 
that I like better. If we are not quite in the heart 
of things, we can get there in a few moments ; and 
our little town has many beauties of its own." 

It seemed so odd at first not to have to run up 
to the station every hour or so ! I did oblige Tracy 
now and then ; but I soon found that the more you 
granted, the more he asked, and so began to decline. 
And now I could throw my whole soul into my new 



 

business. We would have much more to take care 
of this winter. There were experiments to try ; 
there was propagating by almost every method ; the 
continual watchfulness of light, heat, soils ; nursing 
up drooping plants ; weeding out sickly, worthless 
ones. I never tired of it. Each day my soul 
seemed more thoroughly imbued with it, more con 
tent with the delightful toil that was pleasure under 
another name, a thin disguise, perhaps. 

Of course, we went on at the hotel. I added an T 
other to the suite of rooms Lawrence and I had 
shared, a studio for Celia, that was library and 
sitting-room when we chose. She kept up her art 
connection in New York, going two days in a week, 
but relinquished her classes, devoting herself wholly 
to the pictures she loved, as she always had some 
orders waiting for her. 

But we four spent a great deal of time in the 
greenhouses. Eve was quite an expert, always had 
been. Her love for a home and a garden had led me 
to take the first fortunate step in my career. I felt 
that I really owed my good fortune to her ; and, 
though she had refused to take more than her half, 
my wedding-gift to her had been a check for five 
hundred dollars : and, oddly enough, Mrs. Harwood's 
had been the same, as she charmingly insisted on 
not counting her additions to the trousseau. Indeed, 





I thought the wedding-gifts of both brides quite 
munificent. 

By the time we were really settled, business started 
up amazingly. I had been haunted by a secret fear 
that we might overdo, have more stock on hand than 
we could dispose of; but orders poured in. Prices 
varied a little, to be sure, but choice flowers were 
always in demand. I used to wonder how people 
could afford to purchase such quantities of flowers. 
Lawrence and I kept very busy ; but there was one 
delightful side to the matter, if we wanted to go 
away for a few hours, or down to the city to any en 
tertainment, we were our own masters. Our young 
man was very reliable, and Joe always insisted upon 
an oversight of things when were both away. Dear 
Joe ! If any deed of kindliness brought back four 
fold, you returned a thousand-fold. I used to smile 
when I saw him threading his way around, touching 
some lovely blossom with the tenderness one bestows 
upon a baby. How he did love all beautiful things ! 
And how we all respected him for his manliness, his 
courage, and his true, earnest soul ! 

Seven years and more have come and gone since I 
took my first look at Athens ; for now it is spring 
instead of autumn. One would hardly call us a 
sleepy little town at present. We have spread out 



our borders in every direction. Streets have been 
cleared up, built with rows of pretty cottages or 
more pretentious villas. Two more factories have 
come in, but they are all in the part below us, and 
down by the river ; and there is a new station at Park 
Street for the greater convenience of the inhabitants. 
We have a handsome hall, a flourishing musical 
union, an amateur dramatic club, and some very 
attractive social life, a young men's gymnasium and 
reading-room ; and, as we keep some of our best men 
in the Board of Excise, saloons do not flourish vigor 
ously. We may be bigoted and narrow-minded ; but 
I think, as a community, we have proved that there 
are higher and better moral tonics for the poor man 
than beer or whiskey. We have also a building asso 
ciation, of which Mr. Corwin who, by the way, is 
prospering wonderfully is president, Mr. Joseph 
Crawford vice-president, and Gordon Pry or secretary. 
It builds houses on the instalment plan ; the owner 
paying so much yearly, which includes interest at six 
per cent, and a small amount of the principal, or a 
larger sum, as one elects. If, through sickness or 
misfortune, the payments cannot be met, they are 
added back to the whole amount for one year. No 
house is disposed of to an habitual drinker unless his 
wife has means of meeting the claims. The cottages, 
I am happy to say, are well built, if not so fanciful. 



 

Indirectly, it has another side of profit for Joe and 
Pryor, in the sale of materials. So far, the demands 
have exceeded the supply ; though Mrs. Harwood, 
Mr. Wilbur, Mr. Randall, and several other Athe 
nians, are stockholders. 

Gordon Pryor is a very successful business-man. 
His hotel is excellently managed. The added wing 
is larger than the main building; and during the 
season, which begins early and ends late, it is always 
full. There are several pleasant boarding-houses 
besides, and the current of summer pilgrimages to 
Athens is unfailing. Our pretty woods have been 
cleared up, we are at work on our roads, and boating 
on the river is one of our delights during the late 
summer afternoons and moonlight evenings. We 
have also a fair brass band that plays two evenings 
in the week, when people stroll around, or sit on the 
benches disposed about our little nucleus of a park, 
or haunt the broad hotel piazzas. 

Eve's connection with the business management 
ceased the spring after her marriage. A Gaylord 
cousin, a Mrs. MacPherson, who had begun life with
