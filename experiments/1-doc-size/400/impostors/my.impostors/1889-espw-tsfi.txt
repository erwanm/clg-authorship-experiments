dread, if not of suspicion ; when the well-in- 
structed citizen adds to his litany : " Deliver 
us from associations, and lead us not into 
committees ! " when people who draw up a 
constitution and by-laws, for any purpose 
whatever, must show their charter, or stand 
back in the name of over-organized humanity, 
— it is much to say of any newly associated 
effort that its final cause seems so adequate as 
that of the Society for Psychical Research. 
The prospectus of this society says : — 
" It has been widely felt that the present is an 





opportune time for making an organized and sys- 
tematic attempt to investigate that large group of 
debatable phenomena designated by such terms as 
mesmeric, psychical, and spiritualistic. From the re- 
corded testimony of many competent witnesses, past 
and present, including observations recently made 
by scientific men of eminence in various countries, 
there appears to be, amidst much illusion and de- 
ception, an important body of remarkable phe- 
nomena, which are primd facie inexplicable on 
any generally recognized hypothesis, and which, if 
incontestably established, would be of the highest 
possible value." 

It is not necessary to quarrel with the as- 
sertion of the well-known and well-informed 
gentlemen who stand sponsors for this society, 
when they proceed to say that 

" The task of examining such residual phenom- 
ena has often been undertaken by individual effort, 
but never hitherto by a scientific society organized 
on a sufficiently broad basis." 

When the greatest intellectual discovery of 
our times was made, it was wrought out of the 
inductive method, inch by inch, laboriously, 
consistently, and triumphantly. The theory 
of evolution was a masterpiece of loving toil, 




and of relentless logic. Darwin  was twenty- 
two years in collecting and controlling the ma- 
terial for the " Origin of Species " and the 
"Descent of Man." Wallace, who competed 
with him for the formulation of the evolu- 
tionary law, was submerged like one of their 
own shells in the waves that beat upon the 
shores of the Malay archipelago. These men 
gave their souls and bodies to become students 
of the habits of a mollusk or a monkey, the 
family peculiarities of a bug or a bird, the 
private biographies of a mastodon or a polyp, 
the measurable but imperceptible movement 
of a glacier, the ancestry of a parasite, the 
vanity of a butterfly, the digestion of a fly- 
catcher, the moral nature of a climbing plant, 
or the journey of an insect from one desert 
island to another upon a floating bough. 

Induction, which is as familiar as Bacon, 
and as old as philosophy, became, in the 
hands of the " Greatest since Newton," an ap- 

 "It occurred to me," lie says, "in 1837, that some- 
thing might perhaps be made out on this question by pa- 
tiently accumulating and reflecting. . . . After five years' 
work, I allowed myself to speculate on the subject . . . from that 
period to the present day, I have steadily pursued the same 
object." — Introduction to Origin of Species, published in 
1859. 




plied force which has taught the century — 
nay, which has taught all time and all truth 
— a solemn lesson. Two things are needed 
to the discovery of a great principle : the 
power to attend, and the power to infer. We 
might add a third, the power to imagine, 
which may be overlooked in the construction 
of important theory ; but, whatever may be 
said of that, the power to attend, coming first 
in order, must be first considered. Darwin's 
colossal success was owing, to an extent which 
it is impossible for a lesser mind to measure, to 
his almost supernatural power of attention to 
the natural ; his superhuman patience of ob- 
servation and record. He observed and re- 
corded as no other man of our day has done ; 
his power of inference proved equal to his ob- 
serving and recording power ; and we have the 
doctrine of evolution by which physical science 
has been the first, but will not be the last, may 
even prove to be the least of human interests 
yet to profit unspeakably. 

It would seem that the trained minds called 
to the leadership of the new psychical move- 
ment have been prompt to turn the geist of 
the century in the last direction in which we 



 



should have looked for it. The current that 
wrought marvels out of stocks and stones they 
propose to pour upon air and essence. What 
conquered matter shall assail mind. What 
ordered order shall dominate the disorderly. 
The scientific method shall now rule the un- 
scientific madness, and we shall see what we 
shall see. 

In the metaphysical and in the physical 
worlds the legal fibre is essentially the same* 
The material differs more than the method* 
In this case there exists one distinction : that 
it is in a peculiar sense to the help of the un- 
learned that the learned have appealed in the 
work of the psychical organizations. Here is 
a mass of, let us say, asserted but unverified 
fact, which, if true, is of immeasurable im- 
portance to the interests of the human race. 
Such verification is not, as yet, to be found 
in libraries or in laboratories. Telescope and 
microscope, chip-hammer and retort, do not 
serve the case. The literature of the subject 
is, in great part, untested, illegal, whimsical, 
prehistoric to the spirit of the scientific era, 
and to the spirit in which, if at all, such a 
subject must now be approached. Here we 





have to deal with an inchoate accumulation 
of mind-facts or soul-facts, of which the mind 
or the soul must be clerk, witness, judge, and 
juror. Here, especially, we have to do with 
confused freshets and land-slides of material 
which, preeminently above other material that 
science has sought to arrange and label, de- 
pends upon the intelligence and veracity of 
human beings for its classification. Here, in 
short, we come yesterday, to-day, and forever, 
jaggedly against the supreme difficulties at- 
taching to the validity and credibility of tes- 
timony. Here, because of the supremacy of 
these difficulties, superstition and science must 
not shoot, but grapple. 

Hence, we see, with a keen sense of their 
wisdom, the officers of the psychical societies 
appealing, at the outset, to the public for co- 
operation in the work of investigating that 
which is hidden, not in desert islands, or in 
glaciers, or in craters, or in crucibles, or in 
cuneiform inscriptions, but in human experi- 
ence. On human intelligence and veracity 
the test must strike ; it would seem that the 
electric light of science blazes white enough 
now, if ever, to try them. Did it seem a du- 



 



bious experiment to flood the English-reading 
world with little circulars asking for authentic 
cases of mind-reading, or visions, as reported 
at first-hand by reporters willing to be per- 
sonally investigated ? Was it with amusement 
that we first saw these dignified gentlemen 
subpoena apparitions from the most intelli- 
gent families ? Did we fall into the automatic 
attitudes of perplexity when English science 
solemnly sent social cards to haunted houses ? 
Did we ask why this precious ointment was 
not sold to the poor, when we saw learned 
men playing the " Willing Game " in country- 
houses to find out whether the human mind 
can get through sealed walls ? And when one 
of the most important philosophical chairs in 
this country is represented on the committee 
inviting spiritualistic mediums to " demon- 
strate to us experimentally their possession of 
peculiar powers," do we sneer or smile? 

If we are wise, we shall do neither. It may 
not be too much to say that the greatest phys- 
ical and metaphysical scholars of our day can 
do no belter thing with their gifts, or their 
greatness, than to apply to the psychical facts 
the sheer force which has conquered the phys- 





ical — the force that adequately observes and 
records before inferring ; or, as Darwin puts 
it, that " accumulates " before " reflecting." 
As the apostle of evolution collected, collated, 
colligated his enormous array of facts before 
theorizing, they who undertake this other task 
would collect, collate, and colligate the dis- 
array of their facts before they theorize. 

Men have dedicated their lives to the classi- 
fication of an insect, or the cultivation of an ac- 
cent. Why not study the power which makes 
one man able to make another say Peter Piper, 
across the width of the house, with the doors 
shut ? The spirit which gave to the world her 
great scientific gospel devoured itself till it 
knew why the flesh of a creature invisible with- 
out the miscroscope, was of the color of the leaf 
on which it lived and died. Why, then, should 
not a man keep tally of the relative number 
of times that a blindfold subject will select the 
right card from a pack ? " High authorities " 
have wearied themselves to account for the 
difference in the molars and premolars within 
the jaws of the dog and the Tasmanian wolf. 
May not a scientist eat mustard, to see if his 
mesmeric recipient will say that his mouth is 



 



burnt ? Or even ask why a valuable piece of 
property stands unrented for a generation, 
because a dead woman is said to be heard sob- 
bing in it? In brief, are not the methods 
which overcome the mysteries of matter en- 
titled to the same exercise and to the same 
respect that they have had, when they are ap- 
plied to the mysteries of mind ? Here, we 
say, are the facts. Hundreds of people, whose 
word of honor is as good intellectual coin as 
that of the reader of this page or the writer 
of this paper have testified to the conveyance 
of thought, without visible or audible or tan- 
gible media, from embodied mind to embodied 
mind ; to the tragic or the trivial incidents of 
mesmerism ; to the coincidence of dreams ; to 
the prophecy of mental convictions ; to the 
visual appearance of the distant living ; to 
the sight or sign of what is thought to be the 
more distant dead. 

Thousands of sensible and reliable men and 
women to - day believe these things on the 
strength of personal experience ; and, believ- 
ing, accept them with such explanation of their 
own as they may, in default of any from silent 
science. It would seem as if these circum- 





stances were of as much importance to science 
as the transverse lamellae in the beak of a 
shoveler duck, or the climate of the lowlands 
under the equator during the severe part of 
the glacial period. 

A cautious Spiritualist, prominently identi- 
fied with the movements of his sect, in reply to 
inquiries made for use in this paper writes : — 

" I think it would be within bounds to say, that in 
this country, the number who have by personal inves- 
tigation come into what they believe to be a knowl- 
edge of spirit return and manifestation is not less 
than 2,000,000, and that a still larger number have 
experienced enough to satisfy them that there 4 is 
something in it,' but how much they don't know.'' 

Estimates two or three times as large are 
made by less careful zealots. The writer of 
the article on Spiritualism in the " American 
Encyclopaedia," says : — 

"As the organized bodies of Spiritualists include 
but a small proportion of those who wholly or par- 
tially accept these phenomena, it is impossible to 
make even an approximate estimate of their num- 
ber." 

In Great Britain, the number is supposed 
to be larger than among ourselves. Here, let 



 



us say, to take the most modest figures, are 
two millions of our people, intelligent enough 
to conduct the affairs and obey the laws of 
average civilized society, who habitually and 
confidently approach the awful verities of 
death through the unexplained trance which 
we content ourselves with calling a morbid 
nervous condition ; people whose main reli- 
gious faith is formulated — God help them ! — 
in the columns of papers most of which we 
never read if we can help it, or in the pages 
of what they are pleased to call a New Bible, 
spiritually communicated through mediums of 
the sect. Say what we may (and we ought to 
say it) of the nonsense, say what we may of 
the fraud, of the jugglery, the hysteria, the 
blasphemy mixed to a mush with the whole 
matter, the significant fact remains, that here 
is a huge class not of the lowest or most illit- 
erate, while not yet, to any marked extent, of 
the wisest or highest, who believe themselves, 
in our highly-illuminated times, to have found 
some means of access to the consciousness of 
their dead. Here is the massive bulwark of 
the mystery — be it from within or from with- 
out ; were it from above or from below ; call it 





a base trick or a glorious possibility — where 
the Prince of the Power of the Air intrenches 
himself ; that he gives or assumes to give, or 
is believed to give to the starving human heart, 
bereaved of its bread of life, the crumbs from 
the table of Love and Death. Were it not as 
great a deed, is it not as large a duty, to hunt 
down the facts behind this faith, to grip the 
truth from out this error, to have this law that 
lies between the body and the soul, as it were 
to discover the link between a monkey and a 
man ? 

Modern science is systematically severe in 
the conditions which she lays upon the spirit 
of inquiry. The spirit of inquiry may, in 
turn, demand something of her. We say a 
great deal in these days about the scientific 
basis of thought and action. What do we 
mean by it ? We suppose ourselves to mean 
that a subject shall be approached with two 
qualifications : equipment and candor ; the 
presence of equivalent ability, and the absence 
of nullifying prejudice. These two endow- 
ments we have the right to expect of any in- 
vestigators who penetrate the unexplored upon 






the map of Truth. We may assume that the 
eminent officers and members of the psychical 
societies represent a wide enough range of 
training, psychological and physiological, re- 
ligious and skeptical, to deprive us of all ne- 
cessity to question their possession of the first 
of these conditions. As to the latter, we have 
read of the chemist who said to a philosopher : 
"But the chemical facts, my dear sir, are 
precisely the reverse of what you suppose." 
" Have the goodness, then," was the instanta- 
neous reply, " to tell me what they are, that 
I may explain them on my system." Such a 
spirit, which, alas ! is newer than the story, 
would be worse than no spirit at all, in the 
attempt to bring down so subtle and mock- 
ing a truth as that which flies or floats in ob-
