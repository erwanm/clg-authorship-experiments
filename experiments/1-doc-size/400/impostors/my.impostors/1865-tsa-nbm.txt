and so stepped back from it ; not, however, in weak ac 
ceptance of an ultimatum, but to scheme and plot over 
the means of getting it out of his road. He was too 
strong-willed too much in the habit of compassing 
his ends, to retire from this field. On the next morn 
ing, he again tendered money to his wife, saying, now, 
in a kind, respectful way 

" Here are fifty dollars, Lydia, for expenses." 

Mrs. Guy received the money with a quiet air, and 
placed it in her pocket. 

Three days afterwards, a woman who kept a small 
dry goods store to which Mrs. Guy was in the habit of 
sending or going for tape, needles, trimmings and the 
like, called on Mr. Guy at the store, and presented a 
due bill, signed by his wife, for twenty-seven dollars 
and a few odd cents. On the same day, the baker 
dropped in with another due bill, calling for sixteen 
dollars. Guy paid them both, without a sign of feel 
ing, just as if disbursements in this way were a part of 
his system. Already there had been sufficient of mor 
tifying exposure in the face of his clerks, and he was 
not inclined to lift the veil again. But, to have due 
bills to the amount of over forty dollars presented within 
three days after giving his wife fifty dollars, struck him 
as a calamity. This was indeed, he felt, like pouring 
water on the sand. 

" If I were a millionaire, I could not stand this ! " 
he said, in his thought. " The woman is losing her 
senses." 

In the evening, Guy endeavored to approach his wife 
with remonstrance on the money question, but she 



 

pushed him aside with a cold dignity that chafed him 
into passion. 

" Madam ! " he exclaimed, " I will not have my 
goods wasted my hard accumulations scattered to the 
wind ! " 

Lydia made no response ; not even so much as lift 
ing her eyes from the book she was reading. 

" Where are the fifty dollars I placed in your hands, 
day hefore yesterday ? " 

No answer no sign. 

Lydia ! " 

Mrs. Guy looked up. 

" Did you hear my question ? " 

She bowed, indifferently. 

" Then why don't you speak ? " 

" You have got to learn another way with me, 
Adam." Lydia's strangely altered eyes dwelt on her 
husband's face with so fixed a stare, that he felt the low 
shudder which had once before crept along his nerves. 

"I shall, in all probability, take another way," he 
answered, a threat half revealing itself in his tones. 
" As just said, I will not have my hard accumulations 
scattered to the wind. Justice to myself and children 
demand restriction. It seems that you are bent on car 
rying things with a high hand. Nearly a hundred dol 
lars spent in three days, and not a word of explanation. 
No wonder even your children say, that you waste and 
scatter faster than ten men can earn." 

Mrs. Guy started as if stung by a serpent, a sudden 
paleness overspreading her face. 

" My children, Adam ? " she said, huskily, and in a 
voice painful with surprise. 



 

" Yes, your children," returned her husband, with 
an air of cruel triumph. 

"Who said it? What child? When?" There 
was a trembling earnestness about Mrs. Guy, now. 

" I heard it with my own ears ; that is sufficient. 
And when things come to the pass that a woman's 
children remark upon her wasteful use of money, it is 
about time for the husband to interfere and save him 
self from ruin as I shall do." 

This was too hard a blow for Mrs. Guy. She arose, 
without answering, and left the room. In a few min 
utes she returned, and handing her husband a small 
pocket-book, said, in a mild, yet firm voice 

" You will find twenty dollars in that pocket-book, 
Adam, the remainder of what you gave me day before 
yesterday. The due bills were in settlement of stand 
ing accounts. In the future, you must do all the buy 
ing. I shall waste no more of your hard accumulations. 
What you bring into the house, I will dispense ; but 
not a dollar shall again pass through my fingers. There 
is such a thing as going too far ; and you have stepped 
over the line." 

" Don't play the fool, Lydia," said Guy, impatiently, 
tossing back the pocket-book, which fell upon the floor. 
" I've had enough of your silly airs. You're trifling 
with the wrong man." 

" There's no trifling, Adam, as you will find." Ly 
dia was calm, but resolute of manner. " When my 
children are brought up as false witnesses against me, 
it is time that I withdraw from a position that has never 
been satisfactorily administered and I do now with 
draw." 



 

And leaving her husband, Mrs. Guy went to her 
own room. She had been there only a little while, 
when her cook tapped at the door. 

" There's no coffee in the house, ma'am," said cook, 
on being admitted ; " nor any eggs, nor lard ; and I 
don't think we've sugar enough for breakfast. Shall I 
run round to the store ? " 

" No, Margaret. See Mr. Guy, and tell him what 
is wanted. He will attend to these matters hereafter. 

The cook stood in unconcealed \vonder, gazing at 
Mrs. Guy. 

" Did you understand me, Margaret ?," 

" Yes, ma'am. I'm to go to Mr. Guy." 

" That is what I said. If anything is wanted in the 
house, go to him." 

The cook lingered for a little while, and then went 
slowly down stairs. After conning over the matter for 
some time, and wondering what it could mean, she ven 
tured into the presence of Mr. Guy, who sat in the 
dining-room, pondering in moody perplexity over this 
new aspect of affairs. The inflexible persistence of 
character, united with something in her looks and man 
ner that made him feel uncomfortable, which Mrs. Guy 
had shown of late, admonished him that trouble was at 
hand. Margaret entered, and stood before the master 
of the house. 

" Mrs. Guy is up stairs," said he, gruffly. 

" It's you that I want to see, sir," Margaret spoke 
in doubt and hesitation. 

" Well, say on." 

" There's no coffee, nor eggs, nor lard, sir, in the 
house and the sugar's out." 



 

Guy swept around in his chair he had merely 
looked at Margaret over his shoulder and confronted 
her with a look of half angry surprise. 

" Mrs. Guy bid me tell you, sir !" stammered the cook. 

" Mrs Guy." 

" Yes, sir. I told her about it, and she bid me come 
to you." 

" To me ! Aren't you mistaken ? " 

" Oh no, indeed, sir ! She said that when anything 
was wanted in the house, I must come to you." 

" When did she say that, Margaret ? " 

" Just this minute, sir. I told her what we wanted, 
and she sent me to you. 

" For money to buy them ? " said Guy. 

" No, sir. She didn't say anything about money. 
She just told me to come to you." 

" Will a dollar get what you want ? " asked the per 
plexed man, diving into his pocket. 

" Yes sir," replied Margaret. 

Guy handed the cook a dollar, and then went striding, 
in high feeling, up stairs, to demand of his wife what she 
meant by all this. 

" Nothing more nor less," was her cold answer, 
" than what I have already declared. You are a hard 
man for a woman to come in contact with, Adam Guy 
a hard, selfish, iron-hearted man ! For years I have 
been wounded and bruised in the contact. Now, I re 
tire from the strife. Flesh has nothing to gain in react 
ing upon iron. It must, sooner or later, become para 
lyzed. If gold is your idol, worship on I shall be no 


priestess to keep the fires burning on your unhallowed 
altars." 

It was all in vain that Adam Guy stormed, threaten 
ed, remonstrated even persuaded. Lydia had retired 
from the strife. Folding her arms passively, she sat 
down, in dreamy introversion of state taking no care 
or responsibility in her household, and even becoming 
strangely indifferent towards, and neglectful of her chil 
dren. The whole care of the household devolved on 
her husband, who had to order and superintend, as best 
he could, in every depai'tment. In doing this, however, 
he had an intelligent auxiliary in Adam, his oldest son, 
now in his twelfth year a boy who inherited from his 
father a strong love of money, with the instinct of hoard 
ing. Guy could trust Adam. So, to this boy was del 
egated certain functions in the household. He and his 
father held a conference every evening, and Adam ren 
dered accounts of expenditure in the various depart 
ments over which he had control. He, also, in the ca 
pacity of spy, kept his father informed of everything that 
went on during the hours he was at home from school ; 
and often, through the influence of a morbidly excited 
imagination, of things that had no existence in time and 
space. Particularly was Adam sharp-eyed in regard to 
the conduct of his mother ; stimulated thereto by the 
eagerness with which his father listened to every word 
that threw shadow, blame, or doubt 'upon her. 

So entire a change in the order of life, could not but 
prove hurtful to a mind already pushed from its even 
balance. Mrs. Guy's thought and care in her household, 
under all the painful obstructions that were in her way, 



 

were far better for mental health than this dead level, 
half forced, half morbid indifference. If, in strife with her 
husband, the powers of an outraged and starved mind 
were beginning to show signs of failure, the abandon 
ment of that strife, and the giving up of all in 
terest in external things, was to risk the most fatal con 
sequences. Lydia was not in a condition to have the 
mental strain removed. Safety was in life and action, 
even though every heart-stroke lifted itself in pain. 




CHAPTER XX. 



ONCILIATION and adaptation were 
not the means by which Adam Guy 
sought to gain any of his ends. Avarice is cruel and pitiless, and guards its 
treasure in the spirit of a tiger with its 
whelps. It feels that every approach 
ing footsteps heralds an enemy, and 
crouches on the alert, always, ready 
for assault or defence. No matter how 
weak, or harmless, or innocent the intruder, the talon 
is surely bared to receive him. It cannot think unsel 
fishly out of itself has no kindness, no mercy, no gen 
erous consideration. All mankind is its enemy. Thera 
is no scruple in avarice only fear of consequences 
withholds. Whatever stands in the way of its ends, or 
obstructs as to the means, must be removed if within the 
bounds of a safe possibility. It tramples on hearts as 
if they were stones in the street, and is as unmoved by 
tears, as by the falling of a summer rain. 

Such is avarice, and such was Adam Guy. The 
state of his wife's mind annoyed him, for it was an ob 
struction. But, it was never once suggested, that this 
mind was falling into disease requiring the most skillful 
treatment. Her strange conduct, instead of awakening 



 

concern for her reason, irritated him. He was angry 
towards her, not tender and pitiful. Thus, his treat 
ment still hurt and alienated the unhappy woman. The 
sentence, " Putting on airs," fitly expressed Adam Guy's 
appreciation of his wife's conduct. He saw no deeper 
than that. Avarice made him blind as to any true per 
ception of another's state more particularly if that 
stale was the result of his action upon the individual. 

This sudden giving up of care and responsibility by 
Mrs. Guy, acted, as we might infer, very unfavorably 
on herself and family. She fell into a listless, dreamy, 
wretched state of mind ; sometimes weeping in her 
room for hours ; sometimes lying in bed, refusing to 
answer any questions, or taking food, for whole days ; 
and sometimes wandering about the house, seemingly 
bent on accomplishing something, and yet doing really 
nothing. Left almost entirely to the servants, the chil 
dren did pretty much as they pleased, and soon set all 
of their mother's occasional feebly exerted authority 
at defiance. Adam, the oldest boy, acting under in 
structions of his father, came daily more and more, into 
the office of administrator in household affairs. He re 
ceived a certain sum of money regularly, and kept an 
account of expenses, which was nightly examined by 
his father, and the cash on hand ascertained, to see if it 
agreed with the balance shown in the accounts. All 
this was far more satisfactory to Mr. Guy than the pre 
vious " loose way of managing things," as he called his 
wife's mode of disbursing money. 

Mrs. Guy, who never set that value upon money 
which it possessed in the eyes of her husband, had been 



 

in tllfc habit of giving pennies and small silver now and 
then to the children. Adam hoarded, while John spent 
everything that came into his hands spent it all for 
himself. Adam was a selfish miser, and John a selfish 
spendthrift. The new order of things naturally tended 
to bring in among the children new causes of strife. 
Adam, instead of their mother, had the home distribu 
tion of money, and in him they found no generous 
friend. Not a single penny went to them from the 
closely drawn purse, while many a piece of silver, false 
ly charged out in the book of expenses, found its way 
into Adam's money-box. Complaints to their father 
met with no encouragement. His answer was, that 
they had enough to eat and drink, and stood in no need 
of money to spend. Spending was a bad habit, and 
never should be encouraged by him. Adam took sides 
with his father against the children, and so they learned 
to look upon him as an enemy, and to hate him as such. 
John, next in years to Adam, was as strong-willed, 
and as dishonorable at heart as his brother. This sud 
den cutting off of supplies was a thing to which he was 
not disposed to submit. He had a mania for spending 
as decided as Adam's mania for saving, and the means 
of its gratification must be attained. Up to this time 
he had enjoyed, through his mother, legitimate means. 
These being cut of, his thought turned itself in another 
direction. Adam had a purse, always well supplied 
with money the family purse; and John reasoned, 
that he had rights in that family purse not alienated by 
any transfer of possession. So, he determined to help 
himself, at the first opportunity. But no daytime op- 



 

portunities came. Adam guarded his trust with un 
wearied fidelity. Money was too precious a thing, in 
his eyes, to be left a moment unwatched. 

John soon saw that only one chance was left; He 
must finger the purse while Adam slept. So, he kept 
himself awake one night, until his brother's hard breath 
ing satisfied him that he was in the world of forgetful- 
ness. Then he crept out of bed, and taking the purse 
from Adam's pocket, abstracted half a dollar, which he 
placed in one of his pockets. 

In making up his accounts on the next day, previous 
ly to submitting them to his father, Adam discovered 
the deficit, and was greatly exercised in mind thereat.
