Firth. Grafton boy, isn’t he? Why, that’s 
the name of a great houseful of children whose 
mother married a Mr. Mann. My cousin, Mrs. 
Colmer, lives in the same street, a real stylish place. 
Linden Avenue. It made a great talk. He’s do- 
ing everything for them.” 



“ The older boy is a good scholar. Chandler 
spells and reads very well.” 

When Miss King gave him his card, she said: 
“ Chandler, I am sorry it isn’t better. You have 
fallen below last week; then you were strange, and 
everything was new.” 

The boy flushed and stood with downcast eyes. 

‘‘You’ll try to do better, won’t you? I should 
be sorry to have you lose your standing.” 

The face was so sweet and deprecating that she 
really couldn’t use any more decisive threat. 

“ Yes, ma’am,” in a very low tone. 

Then he turned away. It was awful; and now 
his face was scarlet with shame. Mother would 
have to see it; perhaps his new father, who was 
doing so much for him. He had not studied. It 
wouldn’t do to lose the card, some one might find 
it. If he dared to tear it up! But it must be 
handed in on Monday. He was sorry and 
ashamed, and took the long walk home by himself 
when he had the ticket in his pocket. 


CHAPTER X 


COMING OUT OF DREAMLAND 

Mrs. Mann sat at the machine sewing, and 
Laurel was beside her making Dolly an apron. 
When she reached the end of the seam, she glanced 
around and saw the sweet, sad face, the beseeching 
eyes, and kissed him, saying: “ What is it, dear? ” 

Chan drew a long breath and took the card out 
of the envelope. 

It isn’t very good,” he answered faintly. 

‘‘Oh, Chan!” in a disappointed tone. “Were 
the lessons hard ? ” 

He put his arms around her neck and pressed 
his cheek against hers. 

“ N-o-o. But somehow I couldn’t study. Such 
beautiful sounds kept coming in my mind, organ 
tones like those Mr. Evans plays, and singing 
like that at the hospital, only more beautiful. 
And — I forgot about — about the lessons. Oh, 
Mother, music world is a place of delight, and you 
feel as if you were soaring up to the clouds of 
summer mornings.” 


He did look beautiful in his enthusiasm. But 
this would not answer. 

“ My dear, there is a great deal for you to 
learn besides music. Father would feel dread- 
fully disappointed if you spent your time dream- 
ing. Oh, Chan, think how good he has been to 
you! And if the music is going to spoil you that 
way, you will have to give it up until you are 
older.” 

“ Oh, Mother ! ” with a pleading cry. 

“ Yes. You lost a good deal by the hurt, you 
know, and now that you are well you must make 
it up. I want father to be proud of you as well 
as to love you, and you can study.” 

He leaned his head down on her shoulder. He 
began to feel very much ashamed of the record, 
and that his dear father should see it! 

“ Couldn’t you sign it. Mother ? ” 

‘‘Yes, I could; but it isn’t my place.” 

There was a silence. Then he said in a low 
tone: 

“ And I mustn’t be a sneak,” as he put the card 
back in the envelope. 

“ No, dear.” 

“ Could I play a little on the piano ? ” 

“ I am going to trust you to do better. So if 
you redeem your standing next week, there shall 




be no prohibition. And father loves music 

SO. 

Yes, you may trust me.” 

He went slowly downstairs, but as he was go- 
ing to seat himself he saw his father at the desk 
in the library. It would be hard to go over 
there, but he must do it, and putting it ofl would 
be keeping up the sense of shame. So he went 
and stood by him, watching the pen gliding over 
the paper to the end. 

Chan, boy,” and the arm was about him, I 
wonder if you would like to go to the city with 
me to-morrow, and have a little lark ? ” looking 
at him with a fond smile. 

‘‘ I should like it, yes, so much. But — I ought 
not,” and Chan made a great effort to be brave. 

“ And why not ? ” rather curiously. 

Because — on account of this, and I must study 
up to-morrow.” 

The voice had the breathlessness of effort in 
it as he laid the card on the desk, not raising his 
eyes. It’s very bad.” 

But why, Chan? Were you out of training, 
or the lessons beyond you ? Deportment and 
spelling are all right.” 

“ No, it wasn’t that. I — I didn’t try. I was 
dreaming over the beautiful music, and hearing it 



in my mind until the lessons seemed — well, I can’t 
quite tell, but tiresome, and I wouldn’t study. So 
I don’t deserve any nice time with you, for you 
see it is a sort of disgrace. So I thought I’d study 
to-morrow and catch up, though I can’t have 
the marks changed. And next week I will do 
better.” 

He tried to make his tone brave, but it faltered 
perceptibly. 

That is my brave boy.” The embrace drew 
him closer. “ I don’t want you to fall behind. 
You know I have a right in you now. I want 
you to get well grounded in the education every 
boy ought to have. The music can wait, there is 
no danger of its running away, and you are only a 
little lad yet. So we will see what next week 
brings. Were the lessons difficult? ” 

I think they wouldn’t have been if I had 
studied,” Chan answered frankly. 

Mr. Mann took the card and signed it — Ado- 
nijah Mann.” He had never liked the name, but 
he always used it in business. A simple initial 
made it ridiculous. 

The boy’s courage and sense of honor touched 
him deeply. He seemed also to understand the 
power the music had over the child. And the 
man behind the music who lived in this enchant- 




ing atmosphere — would he be a dangerous rival 
some day for the lad’s love? 

He kissed Chan as the mother had done. He 
wondered if he could have loved a child of his 
own flesh and blood better. But Bessy Firth 
could not have been his mother. No, he could 
never resign him to another. 

“ You will come out all right next week I know, 
and we will have a nice time later on. Chan, I'm 
glad to have you wait until you have earned it 
fairly.” 

Chan reached up and twined his arms about his 
new father’s neck. He was very glad he had not 
shirked the issue, for it would have been mean to 
let his mother explain it, while he remained in 
the background. 

Then they were summoned to dinner. 

“ Oh, Father,” began Prim, “ is there anything 
special for Dan to do to-morrow morning? I'd 
like to take my carpet-rag balls over to Aunty 
Betts at Denby and have them woven as soon as 
she can.” 

Mr. Mann laughed. Prim, you are a hustler. 
Dan shall be at your service.” 

“ Well, why shouldn’t you hustle when there is* 
work to do? That playroom is grand, only there 
have to be two in a corner. And you will have 



to get some small rockers. Rocking-chairs are so 
cozy and friendly, they always invite you to try 
them.’’ 

“To hear is to obey. I think that is some other 
person’s unwisdom, for I have heard of those who 
did not obey, and were not deaf, either. Your 
commands shall be heeded.” 

“ Thank you. Mother thinks I am too bossy. 
That isn’t just the word, but when you want a 
thing done you must go at it in earnest. I never 
yet found a thing that did itself.” 

They all laughed at that. “ Flowers grow,” 
said Linn. 

“ But you have to plant them and keep the weeds 
out, and water them in a dry time. Weeds come 
the nearest. I’ll admit.” 

Dinner was always such a cheerful meal. Cap 
reckoned they’d get through sooner if they didn’t 
talk so much, “ but it was funny to listen to them 
an’ it was nice to be where folks weren’t everlast- 
in’ly scoldin’. Mother was the beatin’est woman 
for that, and no one minded her.” 

Linn’s week had been a success. 

“ There’s such a big difference in people,” he 
said reflectively, as they sat around the library 
table. “ Why, it’s almost as if you lived in an- 
other country, and Denby is only about five miles 


away, at least the top part of it. Around the sta- 
tion there’s some stir, but Ridgewood is just 
splendid.” 

In a farming country people can’t be very 
neighborly. They have so few things to interest 
them.” 

Then I’d raise lots of chickens; they’re funny 
and queer. And sheep and cows, and make places 
tidier. We didn’t let everything go at loose ends. 
Mother! But do you remember what a big thing 
I thought it was to be clerk in Mr. Beers’s store? 
And I guess I hustled something like Prim. 
Things were in a mess I ” and he laughed. 

‘‘ Oh, it is a pretty fair country store, yet it 
seems odd to find a place so inveterately rural not 
any farther from several thriving centers. Then 
you are not homesick for Denby ? ” and the amuse- 
ment in the elder’s face deepened the dimple. 

Oh, homesick ! ” and there was a world of dis- 
dain in the tone. 

The girls were thinking up enough things to 
furnish a house, their mother said. Rhoda came 
and leaned her arms on her father’s knee. 

And I want the nice big doll,” she began. 

Mother said I might have it.” 

‘‘ Rhoda, I think mother didn’t say just that. 
She said there could be no more playthings until 



the room was finished. ’ Why do you want a 
doll ? ” 

'Cause Lai has one.” 

But you didn’t care for one.” 

I do now, ’cause we’ve got a playhouse. Lai 
takes hers off and hides it so I can’t have her 
come to tea. I don’t want a dirty old rag-baby 
that looks like — like — an old cow.” 

’Tain’t old cow, needer,” said Lai indignantly. 

You get doity. You have to be washed and 
strubbed all over in the big tub, an’ Dolly gets a 
nice clean face put on.” 

Laurel has made a good argument,” rejoined 
her father. “ And so. Miss Rhoda, you do really 
want a doll ? ” 

A big doll. Bigger than Lai’s, and a car- 
riage.” 

‘‘ Why bigger than Lai’s ? ” 

’Cause I’m biggest. And I go to school. I 
can do sums,” answered the child proudly. 

Rhoda, wouldn’t you like to have the moon? ” 
laughed Mrs. Mann. 

The child considered. Moon wouldn’t be any 
good, ’cause we have to go to bed nights.” 

“ Good reasoning for content. I think we will 
have to see about the doll. Laurel, what will you 
have ? ” holding out his other hand to the child. 





Dishes, an’ a carriage, an’ ” — she glanced 
around the room — “ an’ rockin’-chair, an’ table, 
an’ — an’ umbebella.” 

‘‘ But why umbrella ? ” ' 

’Cause it wains some days.” 

But you don’t go out then.” 

“ I tan play wain in the house,” triumphantly 
throwing up her chin. 

Mr. Mann caught her up on his knee and kissed 
her, while Rhoda climbed up on the other side. 

Children are as good as a play,” he declared. 

Rhoda,” began her mother, “ these great gifts 
come only at Christmas, and that is a long way 
off. Santa Claus has packed them all away, I 
think.” 

“ Stores are not,” the child replied at a ven- 
ture. 

We’ll see if they are not all packed away,” 
and Mr. Mann nodded. 

‘‘If you stay up much longer you’ll want an- 
other playroom to hold all your wishes. It is time 
you small people went to bed,” said their mother. 

“ But I ain’t sleepy.” 

“ An’ tan’t I hang up my stockin’ ? ” asked 
Laurel. 

“ Oh, you must wait until Christmas. Rilla, will 
you take them to bed ? ” 


Mr. Mann put them down, but they went reluctantly. 

“ The children will begin to think they must 
have every wish gratified. You are laying up 
trouble for yourself,’' and Bessy tried to put some 
severity in her tone. 

I have a great many Christmases to make 
up,” he answered in a humorous manner, and 
there was a twinkle in his eye. 

Linn went off in a joyous mood the next morning. The girls each had some house duty, for 
their mother did not want them to lapse into idle 
habits. Rilla put Chan’s room in order; he liked
