ually and grim as we rode ; but, further still, behind those 
gray and ghastly barriers, all bathed and blazing in the sun's 
fresh splendors, undimmed by a cloud, unveiled even by a 
filmy, fleece of vapor, and oh, so white — so intensely, blindingly white ! against the dark-blue sky, the needles, the spires, 
the solemn pyramid, the transfiguration cone of Mont Blanc. 
Higher, and still higher, those apocalyptic splendors seemed 
lifting their spectral, spiritual forms, seeming to rise as we 
rose, seeming to start like giants hidden from behind the black 
brow of intervening ranges, opening wider the amphitheatre 
of glory, until, as we reached the highest point in our road, 
the whole unearthly vision stood revealed in sublime perspective. The language of the Revelation came rushing through 
my soul. This is, as it were, a door opened in heaven. Here 
are some of those everlasting mountain ranges, whose light is 
not of the sun, nor of the moon, but of the Lord God and of 
the Lamb. Here is, as it were, a great white throne, on 
winch One might sit before whose face heaven and earth 
might flee ; and here a sea of glass mingled with fire. Nay, 
rather, here are some faint shadows, some dim and veiled resemblances, which bring our earth-imprisoned spirits to conceive remotely what the disencumbered eye of the ecstatic 
apostle gazed upon. 

With solemn thankfulness we gazed — thankfulness to God 
for having withdrawn his veil of clouds from this threshold 
of the heavenly vestibule, and brought us across the Atlantic 
to behold. And as our eyes, blinded by the dazzling vision, — 
which we might reside here years without beholding in such 
perfection, — filled with tears, we were forced to turn them 
away and hide them, or fasten them upon the dark range of 
Jura on the other side of us, until they were able to gaze 
again. Thus we rode onward, obtaining new points of view, 
new effects, and deeper emotions; nor can time efface the 
impressions we received in the depths of our souls. 

A lady, at whose door we alighted for a moment to obtain a 







particular point of view, told us that at sunset the mountain 
assumed a peculiar transparency, with most mysterious hues 
of blue and purple ; so that she had seen irreligious natures, 
frivolous and light, when suddenly called out to look, stand 
petrified, or rather exalted above themselves, and irresistibly 
turning their faces, their thoughts, their breathings of adora- 
tion up to God. 

I do not wonder that the eternal home of the glorified 
should be symbolized by a Mount Zion. I do not wonder 
that the Psalmist should say, " I will lift up mine eyes unto 
the hills, from whence cometh my help ! " For surely earth 
cannot present, nor unassisted fancy conceive, an object more 
profoundly significant of divine majesty than these mountains 
in their linen vesture of everlasting snow. 

Tuesday, June 28. The morning dawned clear, warm, and 
cloudless. A soft haze rested on the distant landscape, without, however, in the least dimming its beauty. 

At about eleven we set off with two horses in an open carriage, by the left shore, to visit St. Cergue, and ascend the 
Jura. All our way was gradually ascending, and before us, 
or rather across the lake on one side, stood the glorious New 
Jerusalem scene. We were highly favored. Every moment 
diminished the intervening mountains, and lifted the gorgeous 
pageant higher into the azure. 

Every step, every turn, presented it in some new point of 
view, and extended the range of observation. New Alps were 
continually rising, and diamond-pointed peaks glancing up behind sombre granite bulwarks. 

At noon cocker stopped at a village to refresh his horses. 
We proceeded to a cool terrace filled with trees, and lulled by 
the splash of a fountain, from whence the mountain was in 


 

full view. Here we investigated the mysteries of a certain 
basket which our provident hostess had brought with her. 

After due refreshment and repose we continued our route, 
ascending the Jura, towards the Dole, which is the highest 
mountain of that range. A macadamized road coiled up 
the mountain side, affording us at every turning a new 
and more splendid view of the other shore of the lake. At 
length we reached St. Cergue, and leaving the carriage, H. 
and I, guided by a peasant girl, went through the woods to the 
highest point, where were the ruins of the ancient chateau. 
Far be it from me to describe what we saw. I feel that I 
have already been too presumptuous. We sat down, and each 
made a hasty sketch of Mont Blanc. 

We took tea at the hotel, which reminded us, by the neatness of its scoured chambers with their white bedspreads, of 
the apartments of some out-of-the-way New England farm 
house. 

The people of the neighborhood having discovered who H. 
was, were very kind, and full of delight at seeing her. It was 
Scotland over again. We have had to be unflinching to prevent her being overwhelmed, both in Paris and Geneva, by 
the same demonstrations of regard. To this we were driven, 
as a matter of life and death. It was touching to listen to the 
talk of these secluded mountaineers. The good hostess, even 
the servant maids, hung about H., expressing such tender interest for the slave. All had read Uncle Tom. And it had 
apparently been an era in their life's monotony, for they said, 
" O, madam, do write another ! Remember, our winter nights 
here are very long ! " 

The proprietor of the inn (not the landlord) was a gentle- 



 



man of education and polished demeanor. He had lost an 
Eva, he said. And he spoke with deep emotion. He 
thanked H. for what she had written, and at parting said, 
" Have courage ; the sacred cause of Liberty will yet prevail 
through the world." 

Ah, they breathe a pure air, these generous Swiss, among 
these mountain tops ! May their simple words be a prophecy 
divine. 

At about six we returned, and as we slowly wound down 
the mountain side we had a full view of all the phenomena of 
color attending the sun's departure. The mountain, — the 
city rather, — for so high had it risen, that I could imagine a 
New Jerusalem of pearly white, with Mont Blanc for the 
central citadel, or temple, — the city was all a-glow. The air 
behind, the sky, became of a delicate apple green ; the snow, 
before so incandescent in whiteness, assumed a rosy tint. We 
paused — we sat in silence to witness these miraculous transformations. " Charley," said H., " sing that hymn of yours, 
the New Jerusalem." And in the hush of the mountain solitudes we sang together, — 

" We are on our journey home, 
Where Christ our Lord is gone ; 
We will meet around his throne, 
When he makes his people one 
In the New Jerusalem. 

We can see that distant home, 

Though clouds rise oft between ; 
Faith views the radiant dome, 

And a lustre flashes keen 
From the New J erusalem. 



 

O, glory shining far 

From the never-setting sun ! 
O, trembling morning star ! 

Our journey's almost done 
To the New Jerusalem. 

Our hearts are breaking now 

Those mansions fair to see : 
O Lord, thy heavens bow, 

And raise us up with thee 
To the New Jerusalem." 

The echoes of our voices died along the mountain sides, as 
slowly we wended our downward way. The rosy flush began 
to fade. A rich creamy or orange hue seemed to imbue the 
scene, and finally, as the shadows from the Jura crept higher, 
and covered it with a pall, it assumed a startling, deathlike 
pallor of chalky white. Mont Blanc was dead. Mont Blanc 
was walking as a ghost upon the granite ranges. But as darkness came on, and as the sky over the Jura, where the sun had 
set, obtained a deep, rosy tinge, Mont Blanc revived a little, 
and a flush of delicate, transparent pink tinged his cone, and 
Mont Blanc was asleep. Good night to Mont Blanc. 

"Wednesday morning, June 29. The day is intensely hot ; 
the weather is exceedingly fair, but Mont Blanc is not visible. 
Not a vestige — not a trace. All vanished. It does not seem 
possible. There do not seem to exist the conditions for such 
celestial pageant to have stood there. What! there — where 
my eyes now look steadily and piercingly into the blue, into 
the seemingly fathomless azure — there, will they tell me, 
I saw that enraptured vision, as it were, the city descending 
from God out of heaven, as a bride adorned for her hus- 
band? Incredible! It must be a dream, a vision of the 
night. 







Evening. After the heat of the day our whole household, 
old and young, set forth for a boating excursion on the lake. 
Dividing our party in two boats, we pulled about a mile up 
the left shore. Lake Leman was before us in all its loveliness ; and we were dippiug our oar where Byron had floated 
past scenes which scarce need to become classic to possess a 
superior charm. The sun was just gone behind the Jura, 
leaving a glorious sky. Mont Blanc stood afar behind a 
hazy veil, like a spirit half revealed. "We saw it pass before 
our eyes as we moved. " It stood still, but we could not discern the form thereof." As we glided on past boats uncount- 
ed, winged or many-footed, motionless or still, we softly sung,— 

" Think of me oft at twilight hour, 
And I will think of thee ; 
Remembering how we felt its power 
When thou wast still with me. 

Dear is that hour, for day then sleeps 

Upon the gray cloud's breast ; 
And not a voice or sound e'er keeps 

His wearied eyes from rest." 

The surface of the lake was unruffled. The air was still. 
An occasional burst from the band in the garden of Rousseau 
came softened in the distance. Enveloped in her thick shawl 
H. reclined in the stern, and gave herself to the influences of 
the hour. 

Darkness came down upon the deep. And in the gloom 
we turned our prows towards the many-twinkling quays, far in 
the distance. We bent to the oar in emulous contest, and our 
barks foamed and hissed through the water. In a few moments we were passing through the noisy crowd on the quay 
towards our quiet home. 



 



LETTER XXXII. 

Dear Children: — 

I promised to write from Chamouni, so to commence at 
the commencement. Fancy me, on a broiling day in July, 
panting with the heat, gazing from my window in Geneva 
upon Lake Leman, which reflects the sun like a burning 
glass, and thinking whether in America, or any where else, 
it was ever so hot before. This was quite a new view of the 
subject to me, who had been warned in Paris only of the 
necessity of blanket shawls, and had come to Switzerland with 
my head full of glaciers, and my trunk full of furs. 

While arranging my travelling preparations, Madame F. 
enters. 

" Have you considered how cold it is up there ? " she 
inquires. 

" I am glad if it is cold any where," said I. 

" Ah, you will find it dreadful ; you will need to be thoroughly guarded." 

I suggested tippets, flannels, and furs, of which I already 
possessed a moderate supply. But no ; these were altogether 
insufficient. It was necessary that I should buy two immense 
fur coats ; one for C, and one for myself. 

I assure you that such preparations, made with the ther- 
mometer between eighty and ninety, impress one with a kind 
of awe. " What regions must they be," thought I to myself, 
"thus sealed up in eternal snows, while the country at their 



 

feet lies scorching in the very fire ! " A shadow of incredulity mingled itself with my reflections. On the whole, I 
bought but one fur coat. 

At this moment C. came up to tell me that W., S., and G. 
had all come back from Italy, so that our. party was once 
more together. 

It was on the 5th of July that S. and I took our seats in 
the coupe of the diligence. Now, this coupe is low and narrow enough, so that our condition reminded me slightly of the 
luckless fowls which I have sometimes seen riding to the Cin- 
cinnati market in coupes of about equal convenience. Nevertheless, it might be considered a peaceable and satisfactory 
style of accommodation in an ordinary country. But to ride 
among the wonders of the Alps in such a vehicle is something like contemplating infinity through the nose of a bottle. 
It was really very tantalizing and provoking to me till C. was 
so obliging as to resign his seat on top in my favor, and 
descend into Sheol, as he said. Then I began to live ; for I 
could see to the summit of the immense walls of rock under 
which we were passing. By and by we were reminded, by 
the examination of our passports, that we had entered Sar- 
dinia ; and the officers, being duly satisfied that we were not 
going to Chamouni to levy an army among the glaciers, or 
raise a sedition among the avalanches, let us pass free. The 
discretion and wisdom of this passport system can never be 
sufficiently admired. It must be entirely owing to this, that 
the Alps do not break out on Europe generally, and tear 
it in pieces. 

But the mountains — how shall I give you the least idea of 
them ? Old, sombre, haggard genii, half veiled in clouds, belted 
with pines, worn and furrowed with storms and avalanches, but 
not as yet crowned with snow. For many miles after leaving 



 

Geneva, the Mole is the principal object; its blue-black outline 
veering and shifting, taking on a thousand strange varieties of 
form as you approach it, others again as you recede. 

It is a cloudy day ; and heavy volumes of vapor are wreathing and unwreathing themselves around the gaunt forms of 
the everlasting rocks, like human reasonings, desires, and 
hopes around the ghastly realities of life and death ; grace- 
ful, undulating, and sometimes gleaming out in silver or rosy 
wreaths. Still, they are nothing but mist ; the dread realities 
are just where they were before. It is odd, though, to look 
at these cloud caperings ; quite as interesting, in its way, as to 
read new systems of transcendental philosophy, and perhaps 
quite as profitable. Yonder is a great, whiteheaded cloud, 
slowly unrolling himself in the bosom of a black pine forest. 
Across the other side of the road a huge granite cliff has 
picked up a bit of gauzy silver, which he is winding round 
his scraggy neck. And now, here comes a cascade right over 
our heads ; a cascade, not of water, but of cloud ; for the poor 

little brook that makes it faints 
away before it gets down to 
us ; it falls like a shimmer of 
moonlight, or a shower of 
powdered silver, while a tremulous rainbow appears at uncertain intervals, like a half- 
seen spirit. 

The cascade here, as in 
mountains generally, is a 
never-failing source of life 
and variety. Water, joyous, 
buoyant son of Nature, is calling to you, leaping, sparkling, 




 



mocking at you between bushes, and singing as he goes down 
the dells. A thousand little pictures he makes among the 
rocks as he goes ; like the little sketch which I send you. 

Then, the bizarre outline of the rocks ; well does Goethe 
call them "the giant-snouted crags;" and as the diligence 
winds slowly on, they seem to lean, and turn, and bend. 
Now they close up like a wall in front, now open in piny and 
cloudy vistas : now they embrace the torrent in their great, 
black arms ; and now, flashing laughter and babbling defiance 
through rifted rocks and uprooted pines, the torrent shoots 
past them, down into some fathomless abyss. These old 
Alp mothers cannot hold their offspring back from abysses 
any better than poor earth mothers. 

There are phases in nature which correspond to every 
phase of human thought and emotion ; and this stern, cloudy 
scenery answers to the melancholy fatalism of Greek tragedy, 
or the kindred mournfulness of the Book of Job. 

These dark channelled rocks, worn, as with eternal tears, — 
these traces, so evident of ancient and vast desolations, — suggest the idea of boundless power and inexorable will, before 
whose course the most vehement of human feelings are as 
the fine spray of the cataract. 

"For, surely, the mountain, falling, comethto nought; 
The rock is removed out of his place ; 
The waters wear the stones ; 

Thou washest away the things that grow out of the earth, 

And thou destroyest the hopes of man ; 

Thou prevailest against him, and he passeth ; 

Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away." 

The sceptical inquirer into the mysteries of eternal things 
might here, if ever, feel the solemn irony of Eliphaz the 
Temanite : —
