fulness takes such a broad scope. You can never 
know what this shelter, this tenderness, has been 
to both of us! Surely we have found our way 
into the 'King's Country' while yet here in the 
flesh. How sad for those who have no glimpse of 
the promised land to refresh the tired eyes that 
have looked so long on the arid desert!" 

Together the two took sweet counsel, by the 
very river side, as it were. She was quite ready 
to cross over. Olmstead wondered at the gracious 
resignation to all that had befallen her, the trials 
that had come of man's evil doing and selfishness. 

The carriage came slowly, up the drive. Pearl 
Disbrowe leaned out and nodded. Miss Searle be- 





side her, much improved in this brief while ; Mrs. 
Duane was on the back seat, with peculiar, dark, 
little Miss Vasilis holding her hand with a kind of 
passionate eagerness that touched Olmstead curi- 
ously. He had not seen her since the night he 
brought her home. He had been much interested 
in the case. While it had never reached the point 
of absolute danger, it was the result of passionate 
longing that had overwhelmed the worn nerves and 
exhausted body. 

She colored vividly as Olmstead lifted her down 
and carried her to the porch. Mrs. Duane paused 
to greet her sister and ask a question or two, then 
drew the girl's small hand through her arm, lead- 
ing her up-stairs, while the others paused for a 
few words. Miss Eastwood was coming down, and 
smiled upon them. 

" You must lie down at once," Mrs. Duane said 
gently, as they reached Rhea's room. " You are 
still weak." She took her hat and wrap, and ar- 
ranged the pillows. 

" You are so comforting," the girl said, clasping 
her arms about the elder woman. " One never 
feels afraid with you. They are all good and kind, 
but there's something — perhaps it is because you 
have been down in the depths of poverty. And I 
almost envied you your good fortune ! Oh, can 
you forgive me ? That night I thought there was 





nothing for me to do but just go back while I had 
the strength, or die on the way — it mattered 
very little.' 

" Hush, my poor child ! Think how many years 
my sister and I waited. There, you must not talk 
or cry, but rest a little while. I think God has 
something in store for you." 

She kissed the throbbing lips, the wet cheeks, 
and gently impelled her to the bed. 

" I will come up again presently," she said in a 
tender, comforting tone. 

Out on the landing she paused. Something 
had flashed over her like a revelation, a joy that 
would fill her soul, a work for her hands to do. 
Would any one think it a wild scheme ? Would 
Margaret ? What if there came a day when she 
did not have her sister ? She was not young as 
these girls, with their long futures before them. 
Even Miss Searle could start afresh with toler- 
able confidence. She would go to her child. But 
what if she passed heaven's gate with one rescued 
from the evil in the world, and said, " Here am I 
and the children Thou hast given me.?" 

She went down in a maze of half-thought, half- 
thrilling resolve. Some one of her own again, to 
cherish her declining years. Would it be pos- 
sible ! She glanced at her sister, sitting with 
her eyes closed. Would she feel ever so slightly 




crowded out ? Miss Eastwood and Olmstead were 
sauntering down by the roadside fence under the 
waving branches. He would be able to decide if 
there was too much selfish pleasure in the sudden 
plan for one of the "least of these." 

He had glanced up and smiled as Miss East- 
wood came out on the porch. There was a wist- 
ful entreaty in her face which moved him deeply. 
She walked with him to the gate. 

" I want some — advice, I think it is. In this 
idyllic Eden there seem no sins or temptations to 
confess, so we burden you with our indecisions," 
and she smiled. 

Was it aught concerning Chester House ? 

" You were out at Long Meadows this morn- 
ing ? " he began. 

" Yes ; Pearl and I. We indulged in a senti- 
ment of regret as we glanced over the smiling 
fields. You have heard all the plans of the new 
town, I dare say ? " 

Olmstead nodded. 

" Womanlike, we bewailed the change." 

" Well ? " breaking her long pause. 

" One can see the other side," and a serious 
expression crossed her face. " How dreary those 
long stretches of stubble must look in the winter ! 
And the houses are falling to decay. The farmers 
grumble that nothing pays any more. Most of 


 

them are glad enough to sell out at what seems a 
tortune to them. From the purely pastoral side 
it is sad to contemplate. The farmers are vapid 
and listless, obstinate, trying yet to achieve suc- 
cess with their grandfathers' methods. The wo- 
men sit in-doors, running a sewing-machine, doing 
shop-work' for the larger centres at prices that
must starve out their sisters in the cities. This 
is Pearl's wisdom and discrimination," smiling. 
" She would have them raising chickens and ber- 
ries and flowers. After all, a town of the larger 
industries may not prove detrimental. But I did 
not mean to air my newly acquired lore. You 
will soon discern the incompleteness of it." 

Whatever she said had a subtle fascination 
for Olmstead. He glanced up from the patch of 
daisies and clover at his feet. He wanted to ask 
about Chester House Farm ; but she began again, 
to his surprise : — 

" It is Miss Vasilis I want to discuss. I have 
never gone very deeply into the study of human- 
ity. I understand some people, those I have been 
generally accustomed to, and one gets vague ideas 
of the rest, — a very few of. the rest, I suppose ? 
I don't think I was at all drawn to Miss Vasilis 
at first. I had never met one like her in a famil- 
iar manner. I couldn't tell whether anything 
pleased her or not. Sometimes she was almost 



stolid. But there was a curious smouldering fire 
underneath that flared up one night. It was like 
a bit out of a poem. She was really ill, though 
I suppose one rarely reaches such conclusions in 
any sort of healthy state. I was afraid she was 
going to turn out an ingrate on Pearl's hands." 

" No, not that," he replied protestingly. 

" If she had been a little stronger she would 
have gone off, and we should never have imagined 
how the poor starved soul was hungering for 
something she had never known, and was vaguely 
dreaming of in a confused fashion. She has some 
gifts that amount to almost genius. Pearl has dis- 
covered them. She has made wonderful sketches, 
not merely conventional designs for work, but 
absolute pictures, with a haunting weirdness. 
Just lately we have learned that she has a voice 
out of the common order. I thought her very 
plain at first ; but this morning she sat by the 
piano while I was playing, and was transfigured." 

He had never seen Miss Eastwood so roused. 
She raised her eyes with a straight, steady, though 
troubled look, and the level brows were drawn 
close together. 

" I have seen very little of her," he said. 

" But you have seen others. You have had 
occasion to judge. There is a good deal of talk 
about taking people out of their proper sphere 





unwisely. I think in the circle in which I have 
moved there is a kind of caste distinction — though 
no one would really confess it — that says, let all 
these people stay in their own walk in life. But 
what if some untoward accident thrusts them 
down ? Why, Miss Barclay has cousins in New 
York who are leaders of society ! That miserable 
shelter from which Pearl rescued her was not Aer 
proper place." 

She warmed with enthusiasm that made her 
startling, fascinating, in that she was utterly 
unconscious of it. 

"All these things, my dear Miss Eastwood, 
come in the great questions of philanthropy, which, 
in its truest sense, is Christianity. 'He hath 
made of one blood all nations.' And as each na- 
tion, each community, comes into that larger intel- 
ligence taught by the Golden Rule, we shall 
not inquire what was this man's place a hundred 
years back, and relegate him to it, but hold out 
help to enable him to rise. We shall desire to 
bring him into that larger liberty which makes 
all free, which, if it cannot make all equal, at least 
gives every one a chance to do his best." 

Olmstead sighed. The time seemed very far 
distant. 

" It is rather inconsistent, isn't it, to praise and 
admire one who has risen from obscurity, and say 



to the next one, 'Keep in the place where you 
belong ' ? I have been thinking of that seriously. 
I have been thinking of a great many new sub- 
jects," and the lines came back in her brow. 
" You see, Miss Disbrowe has not been hedged 
about with dogmatism and conventionalism. She 
goes so straight to her good work, that her 
strength and purity ennoble it. B,ut I see some 
of the dangers on the other side, and hesitate." 

Her voice dropped to an almost pathetic tone. 

"Well," as she paused with a perplexing 
thought, " what is the puzzle ? Can I help 
you ? " 

She glanced at him with grave eyes. 

"Here is this girl," she said presently. "She 
has a passionate, sensitive temperament. A 
month ago to have shelter, food, and a few com- 
mon pleasures sufficed. She made no protest 
against working for them. Well, if that was 
her place in the economy of life she should have 
had strength enough to go on. And there are 
hundreds of them. Pearl says, dropping out by 
the wayside, hurried off to hospitals and pauper 
graves. It is horrible ! Where one is willing to 
work" — 

Sabrina Eastwood shuddered, and her face was 
white with feeling. 

" Now," she resumed, "the child, for sometimes 



she seems not more than a dozen years old, has 
great capacity. But what if the educational pro- 
cess should develop her in an urtwise fashion ? 
What if one should mar instead of mending ? " 

"You have been thinking of mending?" 

She was so engrossed that she hardly noted the 
eyes studying her with a sudden delight. 

"One could educate her. Even now it would 
be much harder for her to go back to the old life 
of wearing toil, than that night when she picked 
up her little bundle and went out in the darkness, 
a solitary, pathetic figure, because it seemed to 
her she had no part nor lot with such lives as 
ours. In a certain way she was heroic. Pearl 
would keep watch of her, I know, and I could 
defray her expenses ; it would really cost little, — 
three or four hundred dollars a year for a school. 
Should we spoil her between us ? Would we 
meddle and mar ? Would we be likely to unfit 
her for the real work of life ? " 

"No, I think not, with your pure ideals and 
earnestness." 

" But she could not remain with us. And if 
some untoward influence crossed her path ? " 

" Let me think," he said; " I cannot decide just 
now. I would like to see more of her. And 
Miss Disbrowe " — 

"The expense of it must be my part. Pearl 





has many things on hand. You must make her 
understand that when you discuss ^he matter 
with her." 

Miss Eastwood turned and held out her hand. 
He took it reverently as he said good-by, and 
walked slowly down the shaded road. 

There was a little turn, and in the dense 
shadow of the pines stood Mrs. Duane. She 
had come through the garden and waited for 
him. 

"You will pardon me," she said in her soft 
voice, "but I wanted some counsel." 

He smiled, and it reassured her. 

" You were with my sister a long while this 
afternoon ? " 

Olmstead started at that. 

"O Mr. Olmstead!" she cried, "you may all 
think me blind, but I am not. At first I said I 
could not bear any sorrow to shadow our new 
joy. I wanted years of comfort and pleasure 
with her. But " — 

" Do not look too far into the future. His 
grace will be sufficient." 

"I do not look at the end." Her voice trem- 
bled perceptibly. "It was about another matter 
I wanted your advice. It came to me suddenly — 
a great joy — then I wondered if it was wise. 
For years we have been all to each other. A 



new affection could not change the old love. 
And afterward — it would be such a comfort. 
Yet it seems wild" — 

He glanced at her in vague amazement. 

" It is Miss Vasilis,' she went on hurriedly. 
" She has no one, no home, and her future is 
uncertain. I love her. Will it be rash in me 
to take her for my very own ? Will it pain sis- 
ter, do you think ? " she asked with feverish 
eagerness. " For I would put by my own wishes 
and wait." 

He was touched by the delicate consideration 
of love. 

"No," he answered ; " I think it will comfort 
her." 

" I love this young girl. And since I have 
been blest, I must in turn do some good work 
for very gratitude. She is weakly, and though 
I have discerned certain attractions in her, the 
world may not. I cannot give her wealth, but I 
can provide for her comfort. You think I may ? " 

" God will bless your good work." He pressed 
the small, thin hand fervently. 

Now he sat in the quiet starlight musing, not 
only of the future of Miss Vasilis, but of another 
form which swept through his dreams.
