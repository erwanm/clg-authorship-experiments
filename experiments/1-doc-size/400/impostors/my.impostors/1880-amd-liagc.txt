Indeed, it was a pity that Mr. Thomas had not used 
more judgment in the selection of his materials, but 'the 
Pearl,' as she was termed, possessed a flavor of newness 
that had been most captivating through the winter. 


Titania, meanwhile, became quite attached to Mrs, 
Thomas. Ranny's moods were peculiarly variable and 
vicious, but Titania managed to get through, with no more 
Berious incident than having a handful of hair torn out by 
the roots. Several times, indeed, he was quite amiable, 
but she stood in deadly fear of his treachery, and was glad 
to say adieu. 

" I wonder how I shall get my letter ? " she asked wist- 
fully of Mr. Thomas. "Mrs. Chippenham promised to 
write w 

" Oh, that will come in due time, never you fear. They 
won't lose track of you so easy ; " and Mr. Thomas gave a 
sharply confident nod. 

The party took the night boat to Albany. Titania was 
delegated chiefly to Jane Hewlett's care, but Jane was too 
intent upon sundry flirtations to take much interest in 
another person. But Dolly St. John and Titania drifted 
into an odd friendship. The one, who had been robbed 
of childhood, pure and simple, and made an anomaly in 
human nature, the other, to whom life would be forever 
childhood and a jest, who, when fun and dancing were 
over would go through the only tragedy possible for her 
a dose of prussic acid. 

She was but twenty, yet she had spent twelve years 
upon the stage, and remembered nothing before that, 
save nodding in the green-room while she waited for her 
mother. 

The trip was far from dulL Titania had not outgrown 
her love for simple scenery. She sat and dreamed often, 
while the others laughed and jested, and there floated 
through her mind a dim vision of sweetness and beauty, 
but always ending with a chill sombreness, the remem- 
brance of her mother's death. 

They reached at last the quaint Canadian town, the 
scene of their first engagement, and were crowded into 
a rather ding} second-class hotel. The care that Dick 





Bridget was wont to bestow upon his little Queen was a 
thing of the past. The others might treat her to fruit 
and bon-bons, or sips of wine, but the regularity, the 
wholesome diet, the soothing calm after a nervous strain, 
was not to be her strength and refreshment for the morrow. 

It was late when they came in, and past midnight when 
they went to bed. The strange surroundings kept Titania 
awake for a long while, and the stir early in the morning 
shortened her sleep. Then there was a hurried rehearsal 
in the morning, lasting until two, the flurry and bewilder- 
ment of a strange stage, with its stuffy little green-room, 
its narrow exit and entrances, and the commonplace drear- 
iness of dim daylight. 

Titania went through her part with fear and trembling, 
but succeeded in pleasing. There was a lunch, with a 
plentiful flow of ale, the women eating with their fingers, 
and spicing the repast with slang and mild profanity, since 
they were good natured. 

"You'll see that Titania's costume is all right," said 
Thomas to Jane Hewlett. 

" Oh, let me !" screamed Dolly, with her mouth full of 
mutton pie. w I'm a stunner at such things. I'll make her 
gorgeous." 

" I don't care who does it. Her limbs are to be as free 
as possible, you know. Nothing to interfere with her 
poses." 

" Let me alone for that ; n and Dolly winked cunningly 
out of one eye. " I don't believe in what is it gilding 
gold, or painting the lily, unless it's a poor faded lily. And 
Titania's an angel, a sylph, a fairy ! " 

" Dolly St. John, you are a fool ! " interposed the Pearl, 
sharply. 

" This is one of the cases where ignorance is bliss," was 
the retort. 

Mademoiselle Pearl stared haughtily, not quite compre- 
hending who had the best, or who was considered worsted 





Dolly was in her element that afternoon, arranging 
costumes. Signer Visconti, the trapezist, did not come to 
hand until evening, when the party were again assembled 
in the green-room. He was a slight, wiry, brigandish 
looking fellow, a stranger to the rest. The satisfaction of 
Mr. Thomas was at its height. Nothing had gone wrong. 

At an early hour the Alhambra began to fill. Such 
wonderful attractions as the bills had announced were not 
to be slighted. The manager peered out now and then as 
the orchestra began tuning, and rushed back rubbing his 
hands in high good humor. 

"A splendid house! A splendid house! Now you 
must all do your best. We 'll take these Canadians by 
storm, and show them how we do things in the States. 
Where's that call-boy ? Here, you villain, stop your fool- 
ing. The overture has commenced. Ready now." 

Titania sat wrapped in a waterproof, in the lowest box, 
to see the first play, an especial favor gained for her by the 
good-natured Dolly. It was a sparkling little thing, with 
a jealous husband who somehow, in the end, got caught in 
the trap he laid for his angelic wife. 

Dolly was the maid, who with her lover kept the 
audience in a roar of laughter, and was applauded in her 
song. Julie Pearl, as the wife, was gorgeously costumed, 
and sentimental. Jane Hewlett, the mutual friend, did her 
part well. 

Then Valentini and his clog-dancing brought down the 
house, and Dolly St. John set everybody wild with her 
character songs. Then the curtain fell, and the audienc 
hunted down their programmes. " The wonderful fair) 
queen, Titania, in her astonishing pedestal dance." 

What was it ? There was a stir of expectation. 

Slowly the curtain wound its creaking way. The 
platform was visible the pedestal, and there, perched 
way atop, a human mite, a fair, slender thing, with a cloud 
of golden hair, and scanty rose-hued drapery. Was it a 





mortal being? Indeed, she looked more like a graceful 
statuette, poised by a sculptor's hand. The large, slow, 
moving eyes, with their dusky light, the small month with 
its dainty curves, the transparent skin. Dolly St. John 
had insisted upon rouging her cheeks, and they bloomed 
like a pale-tinted rose-bud. Her limbs, indeed her whole 
lithe, petite figure was so exquisitely lovely that the audience 
stared in silence, and wondered whether they had not been 
cheated by some marvellous figure, held in place by stage 
machinery. 







CHAPTER XV. 

A BONO SLAVE. 

THE horns blew out a beguiling melody, and the violins 
came in with their inspiriting strains. Slowly Titania 
moved, and the audience drew a breath of satisfaction. 
Thomas was watching her with a strange impatience. 

" If she would only show a little spirit," he muttered. 

Spirit ! What, indeed, were steadiness of head, and care 
of foot, when a misstep, a wavering of balance, might dash 
her to the floor, maimed and bleeding. She tried to con- 
centrate her mind on the music, to think of nothing beyond 
the performance, but they were long moments of deadly 
agony. It might have been a whole day or half a life time. 
The sea of faces were in a whirl before her when the wel- 
come rope was lowered to steady her as the motion ceased. 

Down came the curtain. Titania clutched her strong 
ally, and for an instant all was darkness before her. 

There was a round of thunderous applause, prolonged, 
then bursting out afresh. Then a bold call that found a 
dozen echoes. 

"Titania! Titania !" 

She came down from the platform quite exhausted. 
Dolly St. John caught her in her arms. 

Still the applause continued, and the cries became more 
urgent. 

" You'll have to go before the curtain and acknowledge 
it," said Thomas. 

" Oh, don't send me ! " the child cried in terror. 

" Come, no airs." 

"It's nothing," interrupted Dolly. "Just go and 





courtesy, and then run back to my arms, you darling. Ii 
I were a rich woman I should adopt you. There, sweet, 
Thomas will be raving." 

She dragged her strained and weary limbs, for the tense 
mental drain had been fearful. 

A shower of bouquets fell at her feet, and the applause 
was renewed. 

Signer Visconti was next in order. He had declined 
performing with the child, somewhat to Thomas's chagrin, 
at first, but the manager was rather glad, now, since Titania 
had made such a hit. Visconti was, after all, no marvellous 
athlete, and elicited such very moderate commendation 
that it roused his anger. And worst of all, the cries and 
calls began again : 

"Titania! Titania!" 

" She must go on again," said Thomas. 

But Titania lay on a heap of stage drapery, trembling 
and weeping, her nerves completely unstrung. 

" Come ! " he cried roughly, " what foolishness is this ? " 

" She can't do it, Thomas," interposed Dolly. " You'd 
be a fool to kill the hen that lays a golden egg. The au- 
dience will be all the more crazy to see her to-morrow 
night. Make some explanation." 

" Hold your clack ! " exclaimed Thomas, furious at being 
thus dictated to, though common sense told him Dolly 
was right. 

" Look at her ! Put her up on that pedestal if you dare ; " 
and Dolly's eyes blazed. 

Thomas went on the stage and bowed. The noise sub- 
sided somewhat. 

"Ladies and gentlemen, while lam honored by these 
proofs of your satisfaction and enjoyment, I regret to state 
that it will be quite impossible for Queen Titania to appear 
again to-night. The pedestal dance is very exhausting, 
and it would not be wisdom for a tired child to attempt it." 

With that he bowed and retired. There was a little 



"

murmur of dissatisfaction, but Dolly St. John sang a song, 
and the broad, amusing farce that followed restored every 
one to good humor." 

" A week of such houses will be a grand beginning ; " 
and Thomas rubbed his hands briskly. 

But a mutiny had already commenced. Julie Pearl was 
jealous of Dolly St. John, and Visconti glowered at the 
little Queen. 

The week was a success, though at its close Visconti 
quarrelled with the manager and left the troupe. To 
Titania it had been very hard, for the irregular living told 
on the child's strength. No careful Dick to note racing 
pulses and heavy eyes. Dolly was very good to her, but 
she was a wild, flighty little thing. Jane Hewlett and 
Julia Pearl quarrelled incessantly. 

In the new engagement, Titania was to appear twice, 
later in the evening, in some remarkable feats. It was fre- 
quently past midnight before she was in bed. She learned 
to enjoy the jolly little suppers, at which Dolly was always 
the presiding genius. 

And so passed a month. Dolly had an engagement in 
New York, Jane Hewlett quarrelled with the manager and 
Pearl, and went her way. Thomas was elated with his 
successes, and formed a new troupe to go westward. 

But here his olden ill luck attended him. Prosperity 
turned his head, and led him into frequent carousals. By 
mid-winter he found himself at the foot of the ladder again, 
kicked there by the very men who had drank his cham- 
paigne, and been feasted at his expense. He grew embit- 
tered and savagely morose. Others could keep out of his 
way, or refuse to make engagements with him, but Titania 
was his bond slave. 

She had heard twice from Kate. They were living in 
Paris, at a hotel, kept an elegant turn-out, drove every- 
where, went to theatres, and to balls and suppers, and dear 
Gilbert was the most adorable of husbands. He had taken 





part of the management of a theatre, was writing a play 
for it, and this news overjoyed the little creature. 

"If Gilbert succeeds," wrote Kate, " and I know he will, 
my dear, Paris is so different from New York, and is not so 
jealous about recognizing talent, he may have a theatre 
of his own, and we shall send for you. I hope you are 
well and happy, and improving. We expect to make a 
great actress of you. Are you as pretty as ever ? I hope 
you keep your hair in nice order. Do not allow any one 
to cut it. I wish I had you here this very minute, though 
Gilbert declares that he should be jealous to see me kiss 
another human being. He confesses that he was desper- 
ately jealous of you. I should send for you immediately, for 
I am real lonely while Gilbert is at his club and the rehear- 
sals, and he has so many people to see on business ; but he 
says it wouldn't be fair to break the engagement with 
Thomas. Do you like him? Tell me everything, my 
sweet girl. Take care of your complexion and your hair. 
There is nothing like beauty for an actress. I hope you will 
grow tall and slender. Next year you will be with us. 
How I am counting on it." 

Titania cried over her two precious letters, and slept 
with them under her pillow. She managed to concoct a 
wretched scrawl, with a strange sense of shame and embar- 
rassment at her own ignorance. But she poured out all her 
child's heart, all her longings. Now Kate appeared to her 
as almost perfection. No woman, except Dolly St. John, 
had been so kind, save in the transient intervals of kissing 
and caressing for some remarkable performance. And 
there was such a continual change to her life. A week 
here, a fortnight there, the friends of yesterday disappear- 
ing in the night. 

At the holidays Thomas indulged in a long debauch, 
the like of which had not occurred for several years. The 
engagements with Titania he found very profitable, al- 
beit they were not of the highest order. Indeed, the poor 




child was dragged to a depth that would have angered 
Dick Bridger, could he have seen his little queen, the 
darling of his heart. 

Titania shrank from these associations. They disgusted 
her, nay, filled her with a horrible fear. She possessed an 
innate refinement, a love of clean and wholesome things, 
and though there was much in the ribaldry and profanity 
that was quite beyond her comprehension, she had an in- 
stinctive dread of it. The third-rate lodging-houses at 
which they generally stopped were filled with people from 
whom she shrank shiveringly, and hid herself in some little 
box of a room, sometimes pinched with cold, as wrapped 
in an old shawl she would curl herself up on the bed and 
indulge in a few solitary tears. 

Kate's letter had given her so much comfort. Titania 
had been trained to such strict obedience that she seldom 
thought of rebelling. She counted the weary weeks, the 
year would end presently. 

In March they went to New York for a brief stay. Mrs. 
Thomas was looking worn, and Ranny's disease had taken 
on a new phase, but little short of insanity. In some of 
his rages Thomas threatened to kill the child ; but, though 
the man had grown brutal enough through the influence of 
rum to do such a deed, still he had a wholesome dread of 
the law. 

It seemed to Titania that she could endure the life no 
longer. The many privations had begun to leave their 
sign-manual. She was thin and pale, the brightness had 
gone out of her face, and a languor characterized every 
movement when she was off the stage. As for her per- 
formances, she went through them mechanically. She had 
grown used to danger and daring. Sometimes the music 
and the applause stirred her up for a brief while, but the 
inspiration was soon over. With a peculiar jealousy,
