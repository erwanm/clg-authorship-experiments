 

tain, wearily raising her eyes from the pile of small 
garments before her. 

" Why not have her up for one of our sociables ? " 
hazarded our most dashing lieutenant, twirling his 
mustache. 

" Frederick ! " exclaimed his wife, in a tone of hor- 
ror : she was aristocratic, but sharp in outlines. 

" Why not bring her into the church ? Those French 
half-breeds are little better than heathen," said the 
chaplain. 

Thus the high authorities disapproved of my educa- 
tional efforts. I related their comments to Archie, and 
added, "The surgeon is the only one who has said 
nothing against it." 

" Prescott ? O, he 's too high and mighty to notice 
anybody, much less a half-breed girl. I never saw 
such a stiff, silent fellow ; he looks as though he had 
swallowed all his straightlaced Puritan ancestors. I 
wish he 'd exchange." 

"Gently, Archie " 

"O, yes, without doubt; certainly, and amen! I 
know you like him, Aunt Sarah," said my handsome 
boy-soldier, laughing. 

The lessons went on. We often saw the surgeon 
during study hours, as the stairway leading to his 
room opened out of the little parlor. Sometimes he 
would stop awhile and listen as Jeannette slowly read, 
" The good boy likes his red top " ; " The good girl can 



 

sew a seam"; or watched her awkward attempts to 
write her name, or add a one and a two. It was slow 
work, but I persevered, if from no other motive than 
obstinacy. Had not they all prophesied a failure? 
When wearied with the dull routine, I gave an oral 
lesson in poetry. If the rhymes were of the chiming, 
rhythmic kind, Jeannette learned rapidly, catching the 
verses as one catches a tune, and repeating them with 
a spirit and dramatic gesture all her own. Her favorite 
was Macaulay's " Ivry." Beautiful she looked, as, 
standing in the centre of the room, she rolled out the 
sonorous lines, her French accent giving a charming 
foreign coloring to the well-known verses : 

"Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France, 
Charge for the golden lilies, upon them with the lance ! 
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest, 
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest ; 
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star, 
Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre." 

And yet, after all my explanations, she only half 
understood it; the "knights" were always "nights" 
in her mind, and the "thickest carnage" was always 
the "thickest carriage." 

One March day she came at the appointed hour, 
soon after our noon dinner. The usual clear winter 
sky was clouded, and a wind blew the snow from the 
trees where it had lain quietly month after month. 
" Spring is coming," said the old sergeant that morn- 



 

ing, as he hoisted the storm-flag ; " it 's getting wild- 
like." 

Jeannette and I went through the lessons, but to- 
ward three o'clock a north-wind came sweeping over 
the Straits and enveloped the island in a whirling 
snow-storm, partly eddies of white splinters torn from 
the ice-bound forest, and partly a new fall of round 
snow pellets careering along on the gale, quite unlike 
the soft, feathery flakes of early winter. " You can- 
not go home now, Jeannette," I said, looking out 
through the little west window; our cottage stood 
back on the hill, and from this side window we could 
see the Straits, going down toward far "Waugoschance ; 
the steep fort-hill outside the wall ; the long meadow, 
once an Indian burial-place, below; and beyond on 
the beach the row of cabins inhabited by the French 
fishermen, one of them the home of my pupil. The 
girl seldom went round the point into the village ; 
its one street and a half seemed distasteful to her. 
She climbed the stone-wall on the ridge behind her 
cabin, took an Indian trail through the grass in sum- 
mer, or struck across on the snow-crust in winter, 
ran up the steep side of the fort-hill like a wild 
chamois, and came into the garrison enclosure with 
a careless nod to the admiring sentinel, as she passed 
under the rear entrance. These French half-breeds, 
like the gypsies, were not without a pride of their 
own. They held themselves aloof from the Irish of 



 

Shanty-town, the floating sailor population of the 
summer, and the common soldiers of the garrison. 
They intermarried among themselves, and held their 
own revels in their beach-cabins during the winter, 
with music from their old violins, dancing and songs, 
French ballads with a chorus after every two lines, 
quaint chansons handed down from voyageur ancestors. 
Small respect had they for the little Roman Catholic 
church beyond the old Agency garden ; its German 
priest they refused to honor; but, when stately old 
Father Piret came over to the island from his her- 
mitage in the Chenaux, they ran to meet him, young 
and old, and paid him reverence with affectionate 
respect. Father Piret was a Parisian, and a gentle- 
man; nothing less would suit these far-away sheep 
in the wilderness ! 

Jeannette Leblanc had all the pride of her class ; 
the Irish saloon-keeper with his shining tall hat, the 
loud-talking mate of the lake schooner, the trim sen- 
tinel pacing the fort walls, were nothing to her, and 
this somewhat incongruous hauteur gave her the air 
of a little princess. 

On this stormy afternoon the captain's wife was in 
my parlor preparing to return to her own quarters 
with some coffee she had borrowed. Hearing my re- 
mark she said, "O, the snow won't hurt the child, 
Mrs. Corlyne; she must be storm-proof, living down 
there on the beach ! Duncan can take her home." 



 

Duncan was the orderly, a factotum in the garri- 
son. 

" Non" said Jeannette, tossing her head proudly 
as the door closed behind the lady, "I wish not of 
Duncan; I go alone." 

It happened that Archie, my nephew, had gone over 
to the cottage of the commanding officer to decorate 
the parlor for the military sociable ; I knew he would 
not return, and the evening stretched out before me 
in all its long loneliness. " Stay, Jeannette," I said. 
" We will have tea together here, and when the wind 
goes down, old Antoine shall go back with you." An- 
toine was a French wood-cutter, whose cabin clung 
half-way down the fort-hill like a swallow's nest. 

Jeannette's eyes sparkled; I had never invited her 
before; in an instant she had turned the day into 
a high festival "Braid hair?" she asked, glancing 
toward the mirror ; "faut que je ra' fasse belle." And 
the long hair came out of its close braids, enveloping 
her in its glossy dark waves, while she carefully 
smoothed out the bits of red ribbon that served as 
fastenings. At this moment the door opened, and the 
surgeon, the wind, and a puff of snow came in together. 
Jeannette looked up, smiling and blushing ; the falling 
hair gave a new softness to her face, and her eyes were 
as shy as the eyes of a wild fawn. 

Only the previous day I had noticed that Eodney 
Prescott listened with marked attention to the captain's 



cousin, a Virginia lady, as she advanced a theory that 
Jeannette had negro blood in her veins. " Those quad- 
roon girls often have a certain kind of plebeian beauty 
like this pet of yours, Mrs. Corlyne," she said, with a 
slight sniff of her high-bred, pointed nose. In vain I 
exclaimed, in vain I argued ; the garrison ladies were 
all against me, and, in their presence, not a man dared 
come to my aid ; and the surgeon even added, " I wish 
I could be sure of it." 

" Sure of the negro blood ? " I said, indignantly. 

"Yes." 

"But Jeannette does not look in the least like a 
quadroon." 

" Some of the quadroon girls are very handsome, Mrs. 
Corlyne," answered the surgeon, coldly. 

" yes ! " said the high-bred Virginia lady. " My 
brother has a number of them about his place, but we 
do not teach them to read, I assure you. It spoils 
them." 

As I looked at Jeannette's beautiful face, her deli- 
cate eagle profile, her fair skin and light blue eyes, I 
recalled this conversation with vivid indignation. The 
surgeon, at least, should be convinced of his mistake. 
Jeannette had never looked more brilliant; probably 
the man had never really scanned her features, he 
was such a cold, unseeing creature ; but to-night he 
should have a fair opportunity, so I invited him to 
join our storm-bound tea-party. He hesitated. 



 

" Ah, do, Monsieur Kodenai," said Jeannette, spring- 
ing forward. " I sing for you, I dance ; but, no, you 
not like that. Bien, I tell your fortune then." The 
young girl loved company. A party of three, no mat- 
ter who the third, was to her infinitely better than 
two. 

The surgeon stayed. 

A merry evening we had before the hearth-fire. 
The wind howled around the block-house and rattled 
the flag-staff, and the snow pellets sounded on the 
window-panes, giving that sense of warm comfort 
within that comes only with the storm. Our servant 
had been drafted into service for the military sociable, 
and I was to prepare the evening meal myself. 

"Not tea," said Jeannette, with a wry face; "tea, 
Jest me'decine!" She had arranged her hair in fan- 
ciful braids, and now followed me to the kitchen, 
enjoying the novelty like a child. "Cafe?" she said. 
"O, please, madame ! I make it." 

The little shed kitchen was cold and dreary, each 
plank of its thin walls rattling in the gale with a 
dismal creak; the wind blew the smoke down the 
chimney, and finally it ended in our bringing every- 
thing into the cosey parlor, and using the hearth fire, 
where Jeannette made coffee and baked little cakes 
over the coals. 

The meal over, Jeannette sang her songs, sitting 
on the rug before the fire, Le Beau Voyageur, Les 



 

Neriges de la Cloche, ballads in Canadian patois sung 
to minor airs brought over from France two hundred 
years before. 

The surgeon sat in the shade of the chimney-piece, 
his face shaded by his hand, and I could not discover 
whether he saw anything to admire in my protegee, 
until, standing in the centre of the room, she gave us 
" Ivry " in glorious style. Beautiful she looked as she 
rolled out the lines : 

" And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may, 
For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray, 
Press where ye see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war, 
And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre." 

Eodney sat in the full light now, and I secretly 
triumphed in his rapt attention. 

"Something else, Jeannette," I said, in the pride 
of my heart. Instead of repeating anything I had 
taught her, she began in French: 

" ' Marie, enfin quitte l'ouvrage, 
Voici l'etoile du berger." 
' Ma mere, un enfant du village 
Languit captif chez l'etranger ; 
Pris sur mer, loin de sa patrie, 
II s'est rendu, mais le dernier.' 

File, file, pauvre Marie, 

Pour secourir le prisonnier ; 

File, file, pauvre Marie, 

File, file, pour le prisonnier. 

" ' Pour lui je filerais moi-meme 
Mon enfant, mais j'ai tant vieilli ! ' 



 

' Envoyez a celui que j'aime 
Tout le gain par moi recueilli. 
Rose a sa noce en vain me prie ; 
Dieu ! j'entends le menetrier ! ' 

File, file, pauvre Marie, 

Pour secourir le prisonnier ; 

File, file, pauvre Marie, 

File, file, pour le prisonnier. 

" ' Plus pres du feu file, ma chere ; 
La nuit vient refroidir le temps.' 
' Adrien, m'a-t-on dit, ma mere, 
Gemit dans des cachots flottants. 
On repousse la main fletrie 
Qu'il etend vers un pain grossier.' 

File, file, pauvre Marie, 

Pour secourir le prisonnier ; 

File, file, pauvre Marie, 

File, file, pour le prisonnier." * 

Jeannette repeated these lines with a pathos so 
real that I felt a moisture rising in my eyes. 

"Where did you learn that, child?" I asked. 

"Father Piret, madame." 

"What is it?" 

" Je it sais" 

" It is Be*ranger, ' The Prisoner of War,' " said 
Eodney Prescott. "But you omitted the last verse, 
mademoiselle ; may I ask why ? " 

"More sad so," answered Jeannette. "Marie she 
die now." 

* " Le Prisonnier de Guerre," Beranger. 



 

" You wish her to die ? " 

" Mais oui : she die for love ; c'est lean ! " 

And there flashed a glance from the girl's eyes that 
thrilled through me, I scarcely knew why. I looked 
toward Rodney, but he was back in the shadow again. 

The hours passed. "I must go," said Jeannette, 
drawing aside the curtain. Clouds were still driving 
across the sky, but the snow had ceased falling, and 
at intervals the moon shone out over the cold white 
scene; the March wind continued on its wild career 
toward the south. 

"I will send for Antoine," I said, rising, as Jean- 
nette took up her fur mantle. 

"The old man is sick to-day," said Eodney. "It 
would not be safe for him to leave the fire to-night. 
I will accompany mademoiselle." 

Pretty Jeannette shrugged her shoulders. "Mais, 
monsieur" she answered, "I go over the hill." 

"No, child; not to-night," I said decidedly. "The 
wind is violent, and the cliff doubly slippery after this 
ice-storm. Go round through the village." 

"Of course we shall go through the village," said 
our surgeon, in his calm, authoritative way. They 
started. But in another minute I saw Jeannette fly 
by the west window, over the wall, and across the 
snowy road, like a spirit, disappearing down the steep 
bank, now slippery with glare ice. Another minute, 

and Rodney Prescott followed in her track. 



"With bated breath I watched for the reappearance 
of the two figures on the white plain, one hundred and 
fifty feet below; the cliff was difficult at any time,
