opportunity to gather and grow, he went on :  Very good. 

Let us suppose the case of a pair of tongs that falls upon 

a man's foot, causing a cruel hurt. Will you claim that 

the tongs are punishable for that ? The question is 

answered : I see by your faces that you would call such a 

claim absurd. Now, why is it absurd? It is absurd 

because, there being no reasoning faculty — that is to say, 

no faculty of personal command — in a pair of tongs, 

personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly 

absent from the tongs ; and therefore, responsibility being 

absent, punishment cannot ensue. Am I right ? ' A 

hearty burst of applause was his answer. ' Now, then, we 

arrive at a man's stomach. Consider how exactly, how 

marvellously, indeed, its situation corresponds to that of a 

pair of tongs. Listen — and take careful note, I beg you. 

Can a man's stomach plan a murder ? No. Can it plan a 

theft ? No. Can it plan an incendiary fire ? No. Now 

answer me — Can a pair of tongs "i (There were admiring 

shouts of ' No ! ' and ' The cases are just exact ! ' and 

' Don't he do it splendid ! ') ' Now, then, friends and 

neighbours, a stomach which cannot plan a crime cannot 

be a principal in the commission of it — that is plain, as you 

see. The matter is narrowed down by that much ; we will 

narrow it further. Can a stomach, of its own motion, 

assist at a crime ? The answer is no, because command is 

absent, the reasoning faculty is absent, volition is absent — 
as in the case of the tongs. We perceive, now, do we 
not, that the stomach is totally irresponsible for crimes 
committed, either in whole or in part, by it ? ' He got a 
rousing cheer for response. ' Then what do we arrive at 
as our verdict ? Clearly this : that there is no such thing 
in this world as a guilty stomach ; that in the body of the 
veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach ; that, 
whatever its owner may do,  at least should be sacred in 
our eyes ; and that while God gives us minds to think just 
and charitable and honourable thoughts, it should be and 
is our privilege, as well as our duty, not only to feed the 
hungry stomach that resides in a rascal, having pity for its 
sorrow and its need, but to do it gladly, gratefully, in 
recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of its 
purity and innocence in the midst of temptation and" in 
company so repugnant to its better feelings. I am do ne,.' _ 

Well, you never saw such an effect ! They rose — the 
whole house rose — and clapped, and cheered, and praised 
him to the skies ; and one after another, still clapping and 
shouting, they crowded forward, some with moisture in 
their eyes, and wrung his hands, and said such glorious 
things to him that he was clear overcome with pride and 
happiness, and couldn't say a word, for his voice would 
have broken, sure. It was splendid to see ; and everybody 
said he had never come up to that speech in his life before, 
and never could do it again. Eloquence is a power, there 
is no question of that. Even old Jacques d'Arc was carried 
away, for once in his life, and shouted out — 

' It's all right, Joan — give him the porridge ! ' 
She was embarrassed, and did not seem to know what 
to say, and so didn't say anything. It was because she 
had given the man the porridge long ago, and he had 
already eaten it all up. When she was asked why she 
had not waited until a decision was arrived at, she said 
the man's stomach was very hungry, and it would not 
have been wise to wait, since she could not tell what the 

decision would be. Now that was a good and thoughtful 
idea for a child. 

The man was not a rascal at all. He was a very good 
fellow, only he was out of luck, and surely that was no 
crime at that time in France. Now that his stomach was 
proved to be innocent, it was allowed to make itself at 
home ; and as soon as it was well filled and needed nothing 
more, the man unwound his tongue and turned it loose, 
and it was really a noble one to go. He had been in the 
wars for years, and the things he told, and the way he 
told them, fired everybody's patriotism away up high, and 
set all hearts to thumping and all pulses to leaping ; then, 
before anybody rightly knew how the change was made, 
he was leading us a sublime march through the ancient 
glories of France, and in fancy we saw the titanic forms of 
the twelve paladins rise out of the mists of the past and 
face their fate ; we heard the tread of the innumerable 
hosts sweeping down to shut them in ; we saw this human 
tide flow and ebb, ebb and flow, and waste away before 
that little band of heroes ; we saw each detail pass before 
us of that most stupendous, most disastrous, yet most 
adored and glorious day in French legendary history ; 
here and there and yonder, across that vast field of the 
dead and dying, we saw this and that and the other paladin 
dealing his prodigious blow's with weary arm and failing 
strength, and one by one we saw them fall, till only one 
remained — he that was without peer, he whose name gives 
name to the Song of Songs, the song which no Frenchman 
can hear and keep his feelings down and his pride of country 
cool ; then, grandest and pitifulest scene of all, we saw 
his own pathetic death ; and our stillness, as we sat with 
parted lips and breathless, hanging upon this man's words, 
gave us a sense of the awful stillness that reigned in that 
field of slaughter when that last surviving soul had passed. 
And now, in this solemn hush, the stranger gave Joan 
a pat or two on the head and said : 

' Little maid — whom God keep ! — you have brought 
 

me from death to life this night ; now listen : here is your 
reward,' and at that supreme time for such a heart-melting, 
soul-rousing surprise, without another word he lifted up 
the most noble and pathetic voice that was ever heard, 
and began to pour out the great Song of Roland ! 

Think of that, with a French audience all stirred up 
and ready. Oh, where was your spoken eloquence now ? 
what was it to this ? How fine he looked, how stately, 
how inspired, as he stood there with that mighty chant 
welling from his lips and his heart, his whole body trans- 
figured, and his rags along with it ! 

Everybody rose and stood while he sang, and their 
faces glowed and their eyes burned ; and the tears came 
and flowed down their cheeks, and their forms began to 
sway unconsciously to the swing of the song, and their 
bosoms to heave and pant ; and moanings broke out, and 
deep ejaculations ; and when the last verse was reached, 
and Roland lay dying, all alone, with his face to the field 
and to his slain, lying there in heaps and windrows, and 
took off and held up his gauntlet to God with his failing 
hand, and breathed his beautiful prayer with his paling- 
lips, all burst out in sobs and wailings. But when the 
final great note died out and the song was done, they all 
flung themselves in a body at the singer, stark mad with 
love of him and love of France and pride in her great deeds 
and old renown, and smothered him with their embracings ; 
but Joan was there first, hugged close to his breast, and 
covering his face with idolatrous kisses. 

The storm raged on outside, but that was no matter ; 
this was the stranger's home now, for as long as he might 
please. 

CHAPTER V 

All children have nicknames, and we had ours. We got 
one apiece early, and they stuck to us ; but Joan was 
richer in this matter, for as time went on she earned a 

second, and then a third, and so on, and we gave them to 
her. First and last she had as many as half a dozen. 
Several of these she never lost. Peasant girls are bashful 
naturally ; but she surpassed the rule so far, and coloured 
so easily, and was so easily embarrassed in the presence 
of strangers, that we nicknamed her the Bashful. We 
were all patriots, but she was called the Patriot, because 
our warmest feeling for our country was cold beside hers. 
Also she was calle d the Beautiful ; and this was not merely 
because of the extraordinary beauty of her face and form, 
but because of the loveliness of her character. These 
names she kept, and one other — the Brave. 

We grew along up, m thaF plodding and peaceful 
region, and got to be good-sized boys and girls — big 
enough, in fact, to begin to know as much about the wars 
raging perpetually to the west and north of us as our elders, 
and also to feel as stirred up over the occasional news 
from those red fields as they did. I remember certain of 
these days very clearly. One Tuesday a crowd of us were 
romping and singing around the Fairy Tree, and hanging 
garlands on it in memory of our lost little fairy friends, 
when little Mengette cried out : 
' Look ! What is that ? ' 

When one exclaims like that, in a way that shows 
astonishment and apprehension, he gets attention. All 
the panting breasts and flushed faces flocked together, and 
all the eager eyes were turned in one direction — down the 
slope, toward the village. 

' It's a black flag.' 

' A black flag ! No— is it ? ' 

' You can see for yourself that it is nothing else.' 

' It was a black flag, sure ! Now, has any ever seen the 
like of that before ? ' 

' What can it mean ? ' 

' Mean ? It means something dreadful — what else ? ' 

' That is nothing to the point ; anybody knows that 
without the telling. But tvhat? — that is the question.' 



' It is a chance that he that bears it can answer as well 
as any that are here, if you can contain yourself till he 
come.' 

' He runs well. Who is it ? ' 

Some named one, some another ; but presently all saw 
that it was Etienne Roze, called the Sunflower, because he 
had yellow hair and a round, pock-marked face. His 
ancestors had been Germans some centuries ago. He 
came straining up the slope, now and then projecting his 
flag-stick aloft and giving his black symbol of woe a wave 
in the air, whilst all eyes watched him, all tongues dis- 
cussed him, and every heart beat faster and faster with 
impatience to know his news. At last he sprang among 
us, and struck his flag-stick into the ground, saying : 

' There ! Stand there and represent France while I 
get my breath. She needs no other flag, now.' 

All the giddy chatter stopped. It was as if one had an- 
nounced a death. In that chilly hush there was no sound 
audible but the panting of the breath-blown boy. When 
he was presently able to speak, he said : 

' Black news is come. A treaty has been made at 
Troyes between France and the English and Burgundians. 
By it France is betrayed and delivered over, tied hand and 
foot, to the enemy. It is the work of the Duke of Bur- 
gundy and that she-devil the Queen of France. It marries 
Henry of England to Catharine of France ' 

' Is not this a lie ? Marries the daughter of France to 
the Butcher of Agincourt ? It is not to be believed. You 
have not heard aright.' 

' If you cannot believe that, Jacques d'Arc, then you 
have a difficult task indeed before you, for worse is to 
come. Any child that is born of that marriage — if even a 
girl — is to inherit the thrones of both England and France, 
and this double ownership is to remain with its posterity 
for ever ! ' 

' Now that is certainly a lie, for it runs counter to our 
Salic law, and so is not legal and cannot have eff"ect,' said 
Edmond Aubrey, called the Paladin, because of the armies 
he was always going- to eat up some day. He would have 
said more, but he was drowned out by the clamours of the 
others, who all burst into a fury over this feature of the 
treaty, all talking at once and nobody hearing anybody, 
until presently Haumette persuaded them to be still, saying

' It is not fair to break him up so in his tale ; pray let 
him go on. You find fault with his history because it 
seems to be lies. That were reason for satisfaction—
kind of lies— not discontent. Tell the rest, Etienne.' 

' There is but this to tell : Our King, Charles VI., is to 
reign until he dies, then Henry V. of England is to be 
Regent of France until a child of his shall be old enouo-h 
to '  

' Tza man is to reign over us— the Butcher  It is 

lies! all lies!' cried the Paladin. ' Besides, look you— 

what becomes of our Dauphin ? What says the treaty 
about him ? ' 

' Nothing. It takes away his throne and makes him 
an outcast.' 

Then everybody shouted at once and said the news was 
a he ; and all began to get cheerful again, saying, ' Our 
Kmg would have to sign the treaty to make it good ; and 
that he would not do, seeing how it serves his own son.' 

But the Sunflower said : ' I will ask you this : Would 
the Queen sign a treaty disinheriting her son ? ' 
 That viper? Certainly. Nobody is talking of her 
Nobody expects better of her. There is no villany she will 
stick at, if It feed her spite ; and she hates her son. Her 
signing It is of no consequence. The King must sign ' 

I will ask you another thing. What is the King's con- 
dition ? Mad, isn't he ? ' 

' Yes, and his people love him all the more for it It 
brings him near to them by his sufferings ; and pityinp- 
him makes them love him.' 

' You say right, Jacques d'Arc. Well, what would you 

of one that is mad ? Does he know what he does ? No. 
Does he do what others make him do ? Yes. Now, then, 
I tell you he has signed the treaty.' 

' Who made him do it ? ' 

' You know, without my telling. The Queen.' 

Then there was another uproar — everybody talking at 

once, and all heaping execrations upon the Queen's head. 

Finally Jacques d'Arc said : 

' But many reports come that are not true. Nothing 
so shameful as this has ever come before, nothing that cuts 
so deep, nothing that has dragged France so low ; there- 
fore there is hope that this tale is but another idle rumour. 
Where did you get it ? ' 

The colour went out of his sister Joan's face. She 
dreaded the answer ; and her instinct was right. 

' The cure of Maxey brought it.' 

There was a general gasp. We knew him, you see, for 
a trusty man. 

' Did he believe it ? ' 

The hearts almost stopped beating. Then came the 
answer : 

' He did. And that is not all. He said he knew it to 
be true.' 

Some of the girls began to sob ; the boys were struck 
silent. The distress in Joan's face was like that which one 
sees in the face of a dumb animal that has received a mortal 
hurt. The animal bears it maki ng no complaint ; she 
bore it also, saying no word. Her brother Jacques put 
his hand on her head and caressed her hair to indicate his 
sympathy, and she gathered the hand to her lips and kissed 
it for thanks, not saying anything. Presently the reaction 
came, and the boys began to talk. Noel Rainguesson 
said : 

' Oh, are we never going to be men ! We do grow 
along so slowly, and France never needed soldiers as she 
needs them now, to wipe out this black insult.' 

' I hate youth ! ' said Pierre Morel, called the Dragon- 

Ay. .baSiau? Ah' .MJsiLsmL . ' You've always got to 
wait, and wait, and wait— and here are the great wars 
wasting away for a hundred years, and you never get a 
chance. If I could only be a soldier now ! ' 

' As for me, I'm not going to wait much longer,' said 
the Paladin ; ' and when I do start you'll hear from me, I 
promise "you that. There are some who, in storming a 
castle, prefer to be in the rear ; but as for me, give me 
the front or none ; I will have none in front of me but the 
officers.' 

Even the girls got the war spirit, and Marie Dupont 
said — 

' I would I were a man ; I would start this minute ! ' 
and looked very proud of herself, and glanced about for 
applause. 

' So would I,' said Cecile LetelHer, sniffing the air like 
a war-horse that smells the battle ; ' I warrant you I would 
not turn back from the field though all England were in 
front of me.' 

' Pooh ! ' said the Paladin ; ' girls can brag, but that's 
all they are good for. Let a thousand of them come face 
to face with a handful of soldiers once, if you want to see 
what running is like. Here's little Joan— next she be 
threatening to go for a soldier ! ' 

The idea was so funny, and got such a good laugh, 
that the Paladin gave it another trial, and said : ' Why, 
you can just see her !— see her plunge into battle like any 3
