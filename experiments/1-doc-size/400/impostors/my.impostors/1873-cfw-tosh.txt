 

seldom did Aunt Faith allude to her past lifo 
and its sorrows, that all the cousins held it in 
reverent respect, and although they often spoke 
of it among themselves, they never broke 
through the bounds of Aunt Faith's silence. 
In her own room hung the portrait of her hus- 
band, Lester Sheldon, a young man's face, with 
blue eyes, and thick golden hair, tossed carelessly 
back from the white forehead, while below, the 
firm mouth told of decision and self-control be- 
yond his years. Once, when Bessie was a child, 
she sat looking at this portrait for some time in 
silence. Then she said, " Aunt Faith, if that is 
your husband, what makes him so young when 
you are so old ? " 

" He died when he was a young man, little 
Bessie.' , 

" But he won't know you when you go to 
heaven, I'm afraid," continued the child, looking 
anxiously at her aunt's gray hair. 

" Oh, I shall be young then, too, Bessie. Here 
is a picture of me when I was eighteen,"' said 



 

Aunt* Faith, taking a box from her drawer, and 
drawing out a miniature. It was one of those 
lovely, old-fashioned ivory pictures, showing a 
fresh young face with dimples, and a sunny 
smile. 

" Oh, auntie, that isn't you ! " Bessie had ex- 
claimed, and the other children having come 
into the room, the picture was shown to them 
also. Since that clay they had never seen it, but 
Hugh retained a vivid remembrance of the pic- 
ture, and, as Aunt Faith looked through her 
desk to find the paper, something in her face re- 
called it to his mind, and there came across him, 
like a revelation, a vision of what she was at 
eighteen. Faith Warrington at eighteen ! Faith 
Warrington, who had long been Mrs. Sheldon with 
her gray hair and pale face. Going up to his 
room, Hugh seated himself by the window, and 
opening the paper, read the following lines : — 

" Far back within the cycles of the past, 
A train of centuries rolls, 
From out whose cloudy borders came the day 



 

Of memory for all souls. 
How long it seems, a thousand years ago ! 
How dark and weary, if we did not know 
A thousand years are but as yesterday within His 

sight, 
Seeing that it is past like one brief watch within the 
night I 

Could they have known, those men of childlike faith, 

Half ignorant, half sublime, 
The fitness of the souls' memorial day 

Falling within the time 
Of Nature's holy calm, her blest repose, — 
When all the land with loving fervor glows, 
And from the naked woods, the empty fields, through 

the soft haze, 
Her work well done, her garners full, she offers up 
her praise. 

A stillness fills the consecrated air, — 
The blustering winds that swept 
The red and yellow leaves in giddy rounds, 

By mighty hands are kept 
In their four corners, while the liquid gold 
And purple tints over the earth unrolled, 
And full of mystery and heavenly peace, as though 

the skies 
Had opened, and let out the atmosphere of Paradise. 

Departed souls I Their memory may come 



 

With grief in Spring's soft hours,— 
With weary, lonely sadness when our hands 

Are gathering summer flowers, — 
With wild despair in winter, when the graves 
Are white with drifted snow, and wildly raves 
The wind among the stones and monuments, in 

accents dread, 
Calling in vain the sculptured names of our beloved 
dead. 

But in this golden dream-time of the year, 

Our bitter murmurs cease; — 
We seem to feel the presence of the dead, 

Their shadowy touch of peace ; 
We seem to see their faces as we gaze 
Longingly forth into the purple haze, 
And hear the distant chorus of the happy souls at 

rest, — 
And catch the well-known accents of the voice we 
loved the best." 

All Souls' Day, November 2nd. 

In the evening, as Aunt Faith was sitting on 
the piazza with Bessie, Mr. Leslie came up the 
walk ; Sibyl was in the parlor playing soft chords 
on the piano, but she could hear his words as he 
spoke. Mr. Leslie's voice was deep, but clear, 
and his pronunciation perfectly distinct without 



 

any apparent effort. He did not obtrude the al- 
phabet unpleasantly upon his hearers ; he was 
not so anxious to show his correct pronunciation 
of " Been " as to force it to rhyme with " Seen ; " 
he was not so much concerned with " Institute," 
as to te-u-ute the last syllable into undue impor- 
tance ; neither did he bombard his hearers with 
the arrogance of rolling rrs. Although his voice 
was not loud, any one occupying even the last 
seat in the chapel could not only hear him, but 
was absolutely invited to listen by the pleasant 
distinctness of the words. 

" I am pleased to be able to tell you that Mar- 
garet and the children are safe in the farm-house, 
Mrs. Sheldon," he said, taking a seat on the 
piazza. " Poor girl, how glad she was to get 
there ! She sent her grateful thanks to you." 

" How did the children bear the ride ? " asked 
Aunt Faith. 

" Better than I expected. Indeed, the novel- 
ty, and perhaps the pleasant country air, seemed 
to revive them, and lessen the fever. They even 



 

walked about the garden when we arrived there, 
and began to make bouquets of flowers, but be- 
fore I left, the reaction had come and they looked 
very tired." 

" You look tired, also, Mr. Leslie," said Aunt 
Faith ; the light from the hall-lamp shone on the 
young clergyman's face and showed its pale weari- 
ness. 

" I am tired," he replied, " but a night's rest 
is all I need." Then he leaned back in his chair 
and sat talking pleasantly with Bessie and Aunt 
Faith. " This is a charming old house," he said, 
" it must have been built a long time ago." 

" Yes," replied Aunt Faith ; " for a western 
town it is quite venerable. The main portion 
was built in 1822, and the wings were added as 
the family increased, without much regard for 
architectural regularity. The stairs were origin- 
ally out-doors on the back piazza, but father fi- 
nally had them enclosed. You may have noticed 
that the west side has only two windows, and 
that those are singularly placed. It is amusing 



 

to think that so implicit was grandfather's belief 
in the growth of Westerton, then hardly more 
than a pioneer village, that he built up that side 
without any windows so as not to interfere with 
the blocks of dwellings which he was sure would 
press up against this house as the town grew 
into a city. It was only after many years that 
father was allowed to pierce the thick wall and 
with great difficulty insert those two windows." 

" That is something like my old home, a little 
village in the interior of New York," said Mr. 
Leslie. " One old man was so impressed by the 
growth of the town, that meeting my father he 
shook him by the hand and exclaimed, 4 how it 
do grow, Judge ! Please heaven, we'll make a 
seaport of it yet ! ' " 

They all laughed at this story. Then Aunt 
Faith said, " I should like to think that some of 
the children would occupy this old house after I 
am gone. But in America, and especially in the 
Western States that is hardly possible." 

" I will live here, if I can, Aunt Faith," said 



 

Bessie warmly. "I love every stone in the old 
house, and every old flower in the old garden." 

"Are flowers ever old, Miss Darrell?" said 
Mr. Leslie, smiling. 

" Oh, yes. Flowers grow old-fashioned and 
out of date just like people. We have a genuine 
old-fashioned garden here, and all the neighbors 
laugh at it in comparison with their smooth 
lawns and choice plants. We have bachelor's- 
buttons, lady-slippers, tiger-lilies, flower-de-luce, 
hollyhocks, and pinks, besides bushes of lilac and 
matrimony; then we have old cedars clipped 
into shape, and ever so many little paths and 
garden-beds edged with box. Oh, we are entire- 
ly behind the times ! But for all that, I love the 
old garden better than the smoothest trimmed 
lawn, and I can pick you a bunch of violets 
which you cannot match in Westerton ; real violets, 
too, not flaring pansies." 

" I too am fond of old-fashioned gardens, Miss 
Darrell," said Mr. Leslie. " My mother had 
one, not so large as this, but resembling it in gen- 



 

eral arrangement. I remember we had a little 
patch of trailing arbutus ; it grew wild, and I 
can distinctly recall its perfume as the snow mel- 
ted. I have never seen it in the West." 

"No, it does not grow here," replied Aunt 
Faith ; " our climate is too warm for it." 

" There is a great difference between the 
climate of the lake country and that of New 
England," said Mr. Leslie ; " there is so little 
snow here." 

" Snow ! " exclaimed Bessie. " I scarcely 
know what snow is ; and as for stories of 
drifts over the fences, and tunnels cut through 
them, I can scarcely believe anything of the 
kind. They are as much like legends to me as 
the fairy tale of little Kay and the Robber 
Maiden. Once at Featherton Hall the eastern 
girls were talking about sleigh-riding, and I told 
them that snow was so scarce in Westerton that 
when a few snow-flakes actually fell, they were 
immediately fenced in and guarded by the police, 
and then the whole population assembled in 




sleighs, cutters, and pungs, to ride over them in 
alphabetical order. Of course, as aunt's name 
began with S, there was not much left of the 
snow-flakes when our turn came." 

"You ridiculous child!" said Aunt Faith, 
laughing, " how can you invent such exaggera- 
tions?" 

" Oh, Bessie can invent anything ! " said 
Hugh, coming out from the sitting-room ; " if 
she had charge of even the Patent-Office Reports, 
she would gild them into veritable romances." 

Later in the evening, Graham Marr came up 
the garden walk. " Good-evening, Mrs. Shel- 
don! " he said ; "is Miss Warrington at home? " 

" Yes; she is in the parlor," said Aunt Faith. 
" Will you go in, Mr. Marr ? " 

" Thank you, yes. I came especially to see 
her," replied Graham, taking off his straw hat, 
and passing through the group on the piazza. 

"Excuse me, Miss Darrell. Is that you, 
Hugh ? Ah ! — Mr. Leslie, I believe. I did not 
observe you in the darkness. I hope you ex* 



 

perieneed no ill feeling after your exposure 
yesterday ? " 

" None at all, Mr. Marr. And you ? " 

" I took cold, as I expected ; but, so far, my 
head has given me no severe pain," said Graham, 
passing on into the parlor. 

" Is Mr. Marr subject to pain in his head ? " 
inquired Mr. Leslie, as Graham disappeared. 

" Chronic inflammation of the brain, produced 
by intense stucly and seething, poetical thoughts," 
said Hugh, in a dramatic whisper. 

Soon afterwards, Mr. Leslie rose to take leave. 
" I feel very tired, so I will say good-night," 
he said. " I will let you know the condition of 
the children some time to-morrow, Mrs. Sheldon." 

" Thank you. If it is quite convenient I 
shall be glad to know," replied Aunt Faith. 

Graham Marr stayed until a late hour, so late 
that, Bessie and Hugh had gone upstairs when 
he took leave, and Sibyl, coming in to the sitting- 
room, found Aunt Faith alone. 

" You look tired, my dear," said the elder lady 
kindlv. 



 

" I am tired, aunt. Graham talked a long 
time. He had something to tell me. His uncle 
is dead, and he has come into the fortune." 

" Ah ! — " said Aunt Faith. She made no 
other comment, but waited for her niece to 
speak. 

" Graham is going to Saratoga next week," 
continued Sibyl slowly. " He thinks of remov- 
ing to New York for a permanent home ; he likes 
city life, you know." 

" Yes," said Aunt Faith again ; but she said 
no more. 

Sibyl closed the windows, replaced the chairs, 
and fastened the front-door ; then, as she care- 
lessly turned the leaves of a book on the table, 
she said at last, " Mr. Leslie was here, I believe?" 

" Yes ; he came to tell me that Margaret 
Brown and the children were safely established 
in the farm-house." 

" Did he ask for me ? " said Sibyl, as she 
extinguished the hall lamps. 

"No, my dear," answered Aunt Faith, and 
Sibyl went to her room without another word. 



 

Two days came and went, and Mr. Leslie did 
not appear.
