nearer, the old house stands out distinct, its ivy-coyered 
side glossy with metallic green. Stretched out northward 
is the depression between the two hills, the ravine or glen. 
How weird and solemn it looks, as if it defied the tender- 
ness of the coming season I Here and there you can still 
see a glint of ice. 

He remembers how he traversed it the first spring he 
was here, and what treasures of trailing arbutus, snow- 
drop, and violet he brought home to Mrs. Donaldson. He 
has a portfolio of unfinished sketches, bits of lovely 
water-colors, in the hunt for which he unearthed many 
of nature's secrets. Yes, one could go on forever, finding 
new loveliness at every turn. If this girl at his side were 
artist or poet, if surroundings could be an index to one's 
soul ! He wonders, as he often has before, what brought 
Mark Ormiston here. Was there some vagrant side to 
his nature, some secret love that money-getting could not 
quite stamp out? 

He is not silent, if he is keeping an undercurrent of his 
own thoughts. They talk of the coming spring, of his 
journey abroad, of the Allaires. Her voice has grown 
full and fiexible, and it has a lingering cadence that he 
never noted before. Certainly she might be unconsciously 
dangerous when brought into daily iriendllness with a 
man like Philip Donaldson. Is there any such thing as 
an absurd kind of duty owing to our fellow-mortals, that 
we should offer ourselves in their stead? 

Mrs. Byrne gives him a pleasant welcome, and he re- 
mains to dinner. There is a new project he learns of, — 
building a summer hotel a mile or two below on a ledge of 
rock that overlooks the river, and several cottages are in 
process of construction. 

" Fashion has found us out," Miss Ormiston says, with 



 



 




hjr iDummating smile. " So you see we shall have so 
opportunity of turning hermits." 

Perhaps a diversion to fashionable life might not be 
flmiss to her. People of means and culture have no 
excuse for standing aloof, certainly. 

They wish each other a kindly farewell early in the 
afternoon. He will spend the night with the Donaldsons, 
and return to the city the next morning. He desires her 
to feel that he is at all times ready to be consulted on 
any troublesome point, or trivial one for that matter, and 
he wishes her success, happiness. 

She goes out on the wide porch in the late March sun- 
shine, and watches him down the avenue, not out of 
sight, though she smiles at the superstition. But he has 
gone out of her life with the Allaires. There are new 
duties, there will be new friends. 



 



 



CHAPTER X. 

FAOIB TO FAOB WITH FOBTinni. 

Certainlt Christmas Ormiston does not find time hang- 
ing heavily on her hands. There are new duties coming 
to light every day. Since she is neither sentimental nor 
misanthropic, she finds in them many satisfactions. Her 
home IS to her an unfailing source of delight. If she 
patterns it somewhat after Meadowcrof t, and resolves that 
it shall be the resort of cultivated men and women, rather 
than the heats and dissipations of fashion, surely it is a 
praiseworthy ambition. She adds a grace here, a touch 
there, refined and characteristic adornments, with a certain 
sense of unconventional freedom that in her severe sim- 
plicity can never degenerate into the bizarre. With dis- 
crimination that would be unusual in one so young, were 
it not for her remembrance of Mrs. Allaire's judicious 
training, she selects from among her neighbors those she 
considers congenial, though she is courteous to all. She 
has still so much to learn, and to her, knowledge is fasci- 
nating. She collects the books of her father's library 
that have been packed in closets and corners and puts 
them reverently in their places, while the novels of Mrs. 
Treverton's time are mostly relegated to the garret. Not 
that she despises fiction, and Mrs. Byrne still delights in 
a pure and tender love story. 

They have an odd and rather startling episode of their 
own. If Miss Clement has had hopes and dreams in 
early youth, she made no moan over their failure. She 
has been a steady worker more from compulsion than 
absolute choice. Her sister married and went out of her 
life, and after thirteen years came back to her, having 



 



 





known happipess in the beginning and much sorrow and 
anxiety before the end, and the two took up a wanner 
than mere sisterly habit, — the need of each other's interest 
and sympathj', — settling to the hope of a little home in old 
e, and secimty from pressing want. Miss Ormiston's 
proffer was too good to be lightly passed by, and it has 
proved an enjoyable home. But if not exactly a romance, 
an incident so "uilooked for has occurred that at first the 
little woman is startled out of her placid routine. This is 
an offer of marriage from the father of two of her pupils, 
who have grown at home in her quiet kindliness that they 
are delighted with the prospect of having her always. 
There is a pleasant heme and sufficient income to be above 
the little pinches and straits of poverty. She is so dazed 
at first that she can hardly decide ; but the regard, though 
undemcmstrative, is sincere. Mrs. Byrne can see no objec- 
tion if Alice can be happy in the new life. 

After some consideration she decides that she can, and 
having once admitted it as feasible, she ends by consider- 
ing it desirable. Her simple preparations are soon made. 
The bride of forty does not need p.n elaborate trousseau, 
and her house is already in order. So, late in the svamer 
there is a quiet wedding, and Miss Clement is Mrs. Pur- 
cell, a meek, happy wife and a conscientious, perhaps 
over-indulgent mother. 

Mrs. Byrne decides, wisely, to keep her position at 
Glen Ormiston. She is in most respects a truer compan- 
ion for Christmas ; she has more breadth, more human 
experience. She has learned many things in the hard 
school of duty, and she has put beside her knowledge, 
charity, faith, and tenderness, and the rare wisdom which 
helps onward halting souls to higher purposes. Her 
influence has been hardly discernible, yet of incalculable 
benefit to the young girl, whose ideals of womanhood are 
softened and broadened, and the dangers of that great 
plain of independent thought and action counteracted hj 



 



 



 

the fine touches of duty to one's neighbor in things both 
done and left undone. If her position, her means, and 
her intellect bring her duties to herself, do they not bring 
a higher duty to the stranger? If these elevate her, does 
she not need them to reach out a helping hand to human- 
ity, not simply in gifts of money, but example, influence. 
Not that Mrs. Byrne would have her tramp dusty high- 
ways or perilous by-ways, for surely her sphere will bring 
work enough, and it is not only to the poor that apostles 
are needed. 

The world about Glen Ormiston has widened out as 
well. New people have come in with generous living, 
society ways and interests, and Miss Ormiston is not to 
be overlooked. If there are some who view her busi- 
ness connection with startled eyes, they make due allow- 
ance for it as an inheritance rather than a matter of 
election. 

She has come to such a keen interest in it that it seems 
half of her life. She wonders now how one could be con- 
tent with the petty round of dressing and visiting, with the 
useless gossiping, the tiresome speculations on lovers and 
marriage, the unwomanly efforts, it seems to her, for an 
establishment. Hers has been made for her, it is true ; 
but she is thankful, every day, that it is so. Still she has 
leisure. She takes long, bracing rides in the fresh morn- 
ing air ; she sits on the great shady porch in the cool 
afternoons, in flowing white, with her book, or sometimes 
a bit of work, when she is in a talking mood or there are 
guests, and as often in pure enjoyable idleness. life is 
BO utterly enchanting. Its dreariness and vexations are 
overpast. Days and weeks fly by, and she is so content 
she does not even question the future. 

They have placed the last indebtedness to St. Greorge's 
account at his bankers. He has gone on to Spain with 
the Allaires and Lucia's relatives as a family party. 
Dolly has written two brief, fragmentary notes. None 



 



 



of them speak of returning, but she does not miss them 
oat of her rich life. She is so glad to be entirely free, to 
have no claim upon the estate. 

" But if we go on making money, what am I to do with 
it all?" she questions of Mr. Donaldson. 

" I never yet heard of any one afraid of making too 
much," he says, gayly. 

" Women may have some limit to their desires, if men 
have not," Miss Ormiston replies. 

"Well, from an oyerplos you can endow an orphan 
asylnm or build a home for the indigent." 

" Tou are quite sure you are not stinting anybody ? " 

"Tou know I told you long ago that we paid the high- 
est wages." 

There had been this agreement between them that he 
was to be the Judge of all matters pertaining to the em- 
ployees. Her own good sense has told her he was the 
better master here. 

Winter comes on apace, and there are startling rumors 
in the air. The years of plenty have led to extravagance 
and extension in everything, and now one or two of the 
largest houses topple over, bringing others in their wake. 
A feeling of distrust seizes upon every one, and a panic is 
the result. For weeks the air is thick with rumors, heavy 
with losses. Firms that have floated on the topmost wave 
of confidence give cause for suspicion, and trust is shaken 
everywhere. 

Ormiston Mills pass through better than many an- 
other house. Thanks to Donaldson, there are no out- 
standing debts. It seems as if they had cleared their 
decks Just in time. To be sure, several large orders are 
countermanded and a few payments fail ; but they make 
no change. Some of the largest factories at Camley shut 
down, and hundreds are thrown out of employment. 
There are organized systems of relief and much ill- 
advised benevolence. 



 



 



 

For the first time in her life Christmas faces the reality 
of the old problem that has so long vexed the world, — 
what shall people do when there is no work? The pangs 
of hunger are as real to the improvident as to the prudent 
man, and neither can warm himself with yesterday's fire. 
Idle men patrol the streets and drop into beer saloons for 
the warmth. Throngs of half -grown boys loiter on cor- 
ners, and are inducted into sins and crimes that render 
their after-lives all but worthless. 

" We shall run at a loss, in all probability,' Donaldson 
says, after January comes in bleak and hopeless. " but 
I hate to give it up. We might try three-quarter time." 

Christmas acquiesces in that. The days are short, and 
the hour's sleep in the morning will not come amiss. If 
the men get home a little earlier, they will still have a 
warm fireside. 

There is a little less pleasure, perhaps. Amusements 
are not so well attended, and simpler ones take their 
places. But there does not seem so great a change as 
Christmas expects. There are still dinners and parties. 
She is troubled with some misgivings as to how much she 
ought to give up. There are really no superfluous ser- 
vants at Glen Ormiston, but she could hire a dozen extra 
ones every week. She will have no fine dresses, and 
instead of a party give some enjoyable teas. Her charity 
is open-handed, yet has certain discriminating qualities. 

Presently people crawl out of the shadow and survey 
the devastation. There is much confusion and ready 
blame for fast living and extravagant pleasures. Business 
men count closer, wages drop, new methods are invented 
that save the labor of a man here and there, and new pro- 
cesses that cheapen production. Ormiston Mills cannot 
afford to be left behind, and yet trade is falling away. 

"If we are going to make money, something must be 
done," Donaldson says, in his resolute way. " We cannot 
afford to be sentimental; the cost of living has been 



 



 





reduced, and we must follow suit and reduce wages. Let 
us begin at the head. My salary is a generous one, and 
t can do on less ; if the men know this, they will submit 
the more readily." 

"You?'' Miss Ormiston is silent a moment from 
surprise. "But you have done so much," she rejoins 
vehemently. " It is you who have saved everything in a 
worse strait than this ; it is you who have the responsibil- 
ity. No, you shall not begin with yourself ! " 

She looks very proud and noble in her commanding air ; 
she has, too, an unspoken, generous admiration in every 
feature. 

" Ton must allow me to be the judge in this matter," 
he insists gently. 

"Why should not the retrenchment begin with me as 
well?" she questions. 

" You have been especially economical, I think. Many 
women in your station would not have displayed so wise a 
forethought. But for the morale of the matter, you will 
find my plan the best." 

" Do you know," she begins with a bright smile, " that 
I seem merely playing at business. I go over books as if 
you were not to be trusted. I discuss plans with you, feel- 
ing that your years of experience give you the best right 
to decide. Why should I not do something really useful? 
I could keep books." And her air is one of resolution. 

Donaldson muses. He has been taking rather severe 
duty of late, as the bookkeeper left some months before, 
and he has thought it best not to supply his place ; but it 
makes extra hours for him, and there has been some 
objection at home. His family surely have a right to the 
time, and it is not Miss Ormiston's, since she does not 
demand it and does not pay him for it. This is clearly 
one of the cases where he has not the supreme right to be 
generous to another woman. 

" Well," he answers slowly, " I have been trying to 



 

train Groodrich since Brooke went away ; but if you pre« 
f erred taking say two or three hoars' duty a day, it would 
give me a little more time for other matters." 

" How thoughtless I have been I but it was not my wisL 
to have you without a book-keeper,' she says, rather 
reproachfully. 

"It is not as if we had been running at full speed" ; 
and he smiles a little. " There has been less to do in 
every department."
