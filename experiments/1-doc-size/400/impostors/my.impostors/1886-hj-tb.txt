when Verena rises to eloquence. It's as if the chords were 
strung across her own heart ; she seems to vibrate, to echo 
with every word. It's a very close and very beautiful tie, 
and we think everything of it here. They will work 
together for a great good !' 



 

'  I hope so,' Ransom remarked. ' But in spite of it 
Miss Tarrant spends a part of her time with her father and 
mother.' 

' Yes, she seems to have something for every one. If 
you were to see her at home, you would think she was 
all the daughter. She leads a lovely life !' said Miss 
Birdseye. 

' See her at home ? That's exactly what I want ! ' 
Ransom rejoined, feeling that if he was to come to this he 
needn't have had scruples at first. 'I haven't forgotten 
that she invited me, when I met her.' 

( Oh, of course she attracts many visitors,' said Miss 
Birdseye, limiting her encouragement to this statement. 

' Yes ; she must be used to admirers. And where, in 
Cambridge, do her family live?' 

' Oh, it's on one of those little streets that don't seem to 
have very much of a name. But they do call it they do 
call it ' she meditated, audibly. 

This process was interrupted by an abrupt allocution 
from the conductor. ' I guess you change here for your 
place. You want one of them blue cars.' 

The good lady returned to a sense of the situation, and 
Ransom helped her out of the vehicle, with the aid, as 
before, of a certain amount of propulsion from the con- 
ductor. Her road branched off to the right, and she had 
to wait on the corner of a street, there being as yet no blue 
car within hail. The corner was quiet and the day favour- 
able to patience a day of relaxed rigour and intense 
brilliancy. It was as if the touch of the air itself were 
gloved, and the street -colouring had the richness of a 
superficial thaw. Ransom, of course, waited with his 
philanthropic companion, though she now protested more 
vigorously against the idea that a gentleman from the 
South should pretend to teach an old abolitionist the 
mysteries of Boston. He promised to leave her when he 
should have consigned her to the blue car ; and meanwhile 
they stood in the sun, with their backs against an apothe- 
cary's window, and she tried again, at his suggestion, to 
remember the name of Doctor Tarrant's street. ' I guess 
if you ask for Doctor Tarrant, any one can tell you,' she 



 

said; and then suddenly the address came to her the 
residence of the mesmeric healer was in Monadnoc Place. 

' But you'll have to ask for that, so it comes to the same,' 
she went on. After this she added, with a friendliness 
more personal, 'Ain't you going to see your cousin too?' 

'Not if I can help it!' 

Miss Birdseye gave a little ineffectual sigh. 'Well, I 
suppose every one must act out their ideal. That's what 
Olive Chancellor does. She's a very noble character.' 

' Oh yes, a glorious nature.' 

' You know their opinions are just the same hers and 
Verena's,' Miss Birdseye placidly continued. ' So why 
should you make a distinction?' 

' My dear madam,' said Ransom, ' does a woman consist 
of nothing but her opinions ? I like Miss Tarrant's lovely 
face better, to begin with.' 

'Well, she is pretty-looking.' And Miss Birdseye gave 
another sigh, as if she had had a theory submitted to her 
that one about a lady's opinions which, with all that was 
unfamiliar and peculiar lying behind it, she was really too 
old to look into much. It might have been the first time 
she really felt her age. ' There's a blue car,' she said, in a 
tone of mild relief. 

' It will be some moments before it gets here. More- 
over, I don't believe that at bottom they are Miss Tarrant's 
opinions,' Ransom added. 

' You mustn't think she hasn't a strong hold of them,' 
his companion exclaimed, more briskly. ' If you think she 
is not sincere, you are very much mistaken. Those views 
are just her life.' 

' Well, she may bring me round to them,' said Ransom, 
smiling. 

Miss Birdseye had been watching her blue car, the 
advance of which was temporarily obstructed. At this, 
she transferred her eyes to him, gazing at him solemnly out 
of the pervasive window of her spectacles. 'Well, I 
shouldn't wonder if she did ! Yes, that will be a good 
thing. I don't see how you can help being a good deal 
shaken by her. She has acted on so many.' 

' I see ; no doubt she will act on me.' Then it occurred 



 

to Ransom to add : ' By the way, Miss Birdseye, perhaps 
you will be so kind as not to mention this meeting of ours 
to my cousin, in case of your seeing her again. I have a 
perfectly good conscience in not calling upon her, but I 
shouldn't like her to think that I announced my slighting 
intention all over the town. I don't want to offend her, 
and she had better not know that I have been in Boston. 
If you don't tell her, no one else will.' 

'Do you wish me to conceal ?' murmured Miss 

Birdseye, panting a little. 

' No, I don't want you to conceal anything. I only 
want you to let this incident pass to say nothing.' 

'Well, I never did anything of that kind.' 

' Of what kind ?' Ransom was half vexed, half touched 
by her inability to enter into his point of view, and her 
resistance made him hold to his idea the more. ' It is 
very simple, what I ask of you. You are under no obliga- 
tion to tell Miss Chancellor everything that happens to you, 
are you?' 

His request seemed still something of a shock to the 
poor old lady's candour. ' Well, I see her very often, and 
we talk a great deal. And then won't Verena tell her?' 

'I have thought of that but I hope not.' 

' She tells her most everything. Their union is so close.' 

'She won't want her to be wounded,' Ransom said, 
ingeniously. 

'Well, you are considerate.' And Miss Birdseye con- 
tinued to gaze at him. ' It's a pity you can't sympathise.' 

'As I tell you, perhaps Miss Tarrant will bring me 
round. You have before you a possible convert,' Ransom 
went on, without, I fear, putting up the least little prayer 
to heaven that his dishonesty might be forgiven. 

' I should be very happy to think that after I have 
told you her address in this secret way.' A smile of infinite 
mildness glimmered in Miss Birdseye's face, and she added : 
' Well, I guess that will be your fate. She has affected so 
many. I would keep very quiet if I thought that. Yes, 
she will bring you round.' 

' I will let you know as soon as she does,' Basil Ransom 
said. ' Here is your car at last' 



 

'  Well, I believe in the victory of the truth. I won't 
say anything.' And she suffered the young man to lead 
her to the car, which had now stopped at their corner. 

'  I hope very much I shall see you again,' he remarked, 
as they went. 

'  Well, I am always round the streets, in Boston/ And 
while, lifting and pushing, he was helping again to insert 
her into the oblong receptacle, she turned a little and re- 
peated, ' She will affect you ! If that's to be your secret, I 
will keep it,' Ransom heard her subjoin. He raised his 
hat and waved her a farewell, but she didn't see him ; she 
was squeezing further into the car and making the discovery 
that this time it was full and there was no seat for her. 
Surely, however, he said to himself, every man in the place 
would offer his own to such an innocent old dear. 



XXIV. 

A LITTLE more than an hour after this he stood in the 
parlour of Doctor Tarrant's suburban residence, in Monadnoc 
Place. He had induced a juvenile maid-servant, by an 
appeal somewhat impassioned, to let the ladies know that 
he was there ; and she had returned, after a long absence, 
to say that Miss Tarrant would come down to him in a 
little while. He possessed himself, according to his wont, 
of the nearest book (it lay on the table, with an old magazine 
and a little japanned tray containing Tarrant's professional 
cards his denomination as a mesmeric healer), and spent 
ten minutes in turning it over. It was a biography of Mrs. 
Ada T. P. Foat, the celebrated trance-lecturer, and was 
embellished by a portrait representing the lady with a sur- 
prised expression and innumerable ringlets. Ransom said 
to himself, after reading a few pages, that much ridicule 
had been cast upon Southern literature ; but if that was a 
fair specimen of Northern ! and he threw it back upon 
the table with a gesture almost as contemptuous as if he had 
not known perfectly, after so long a residence in the North, 
that it was not, while he wondered whether this was the 
sort of thing Miss Tarrant had been brought up on. There 
was no other book to be seen, and he remembered to have 
read the magazine ; so there was finally nothing for him, as 
the occupants of the house failed still to appear, but to 
stare before him, into the bright, bare, common little room, 
which was so hot that he wished to open a window, and of 
which an ugly, undraped cross-light seemed to have taken 
upon itself to reveal the poverty. Ransom, as I have 
mentioned, had not a high standard of comfort, and noticed 
little, usually, how people's houses were furnished it was 
only when they were very pretty that he observed ; but 



 

what he saw while he waited at Doctor Tarrant's made him 
say to himself that it was no wonder Verena liked better to 
live with Olive Chancellor. He even began to wonder 
whether it were for the sake of that superior softness she 
had cultivated Miss Chancellor's favour, and whether Mrs. 
Luna had been right about her being mercenary and in- 
sincere. So many minutes elapsed before she appeared 
that he had time to remember he really knew nothing to 
the contrary, as well as to consider the oddity (so great 
when one did consider it), of his coming out to Cambridge 
to see her, when he had only a few hours in Boston to 
spare, a year and a half after she had given him her very 
casual invitation. She had not refused to receive him, at 
any rate ; she was free to, if it didn't please her. And not 
only this, but she was apparently making herself fine in his 
honour, inasmuch as he heard a rapid footstep move to and 
fro above his head, and even, through the slightness which 
in Monadnoc Place did service for an upper floor, the 
sound of drawers and presses opened and closed. Some 
one was ' flying round,' as they said in Mississippi. At last 
the stairs creaked under a light tread, and the next moment 
a brilliant person came into the room. 

His reminiscence of her had been very pretty ; but now 
that she had developed and matured, the little prophetess 
was prettier still. Her splendid hair seemed to shine ; her 
cheek and chin had a curve which struck him by its fine- 
ness ; her eyes and lips were full of smiles and greetings. 
She had appeared to him before as a creature of brightness, 
but now she lighted up the place, she irradiated, she made 
everything that surrounded her of no consequence ; dropping 
upon the shabby sofa with an effect as charming as if she 
had been a nymph sinking on a leopard-skin, and with the 
native sweetness of her voice forcing him to listen till she 
spoke again. It was not long before he perceived that 
this added lustre was simply success ; she was young and 
tender still, but the sound of a great applauding audience 
had been in her ears ; it formed an element in which she 
felt buoyant and floated. Still, however, her glance was as 
pure as it was direct, and that fantastic fairness hung about 
her which had made an impression on him of old, and 



 

which reminded him of unworldly places he didn't know 
where convent-cloisters or vales of Arcady. At that other 
time she had been parti-coloured and bedizened, and she 
had always an air of costume, only now her costume was 
richer and more chastened. It was her line, her condition, 
part of her expression. If at Miss Birdseye's, and after- 
wards in Charles Street, she might have been a rope-dancer, 
to-day she made a 'scene' of the mean little room in. 
Monadnoc Place, such a scene as a prima donna makes of 
daubed canvas and dusty boards. She addressed Basil 
Ransom as if she had seen him the other week and his 
merits were fresh to her, though she let him, while she sat 
smiling at him, explain in his own rather ceremonious way 
why it was he had presumed to call upon her on so slight 
an acquaintance on an invitation which she herself had 
had more than time to forget. His explanation, as a finished 
and satisfactory thing, quite broke down ; there was no 
more impressive reason than that he had simply wished to 
see her. He became aware that this motive loomed large, 
and that her listening smile, innocent as it was, in the 
Arcadian manner, of mockery, seemed to accuse him of 
not having the courage of his inclination. He had alluded 
especially to their meeting at Miss Chancellor's ; there it 
was that she had told him she should be glad to see him in 
her home. 

'Oh yes, I remember perfectly, and I remember quite 
as well seeing you at Miss Birdseye's the night before. I 
made a speech don't you remember ? That was delight- 
ful.' 

' It was delightful indeed,' said Basil Ransom. 

' I don't mean my speech ; I mean the whole thing. 
It was then I made Miss Chancellor's acquaintance. I 
don't know whether you know how we work together. She 
has done so much for me.' 

' Do you still make speeches?' Ransom asked, conscious, 
as soon as he had uttered it, that the question was below 
the mark. 

' Still ? Why, I should hope so ; it's all I'm good for ! 
It's my life or it's going to be. And it's Miss Chancellor's 
too. We are determined to do something.' 



 

'And does she make speeches too?' 

' Well, she makes mine or the best part of them. She 
tells me what to say the real things, the strong things. 
It's Miss Chancellor as much as me !' said the singular 
girl, with a generous complacency which was yet half 
ludicrous. 

'I should like to hear you again,' Basil Ransom re- 
joined. 

'Well, you must come some night. You will have 
plenty of chances. We are going on from triumph to 
triumph.' 

Her brightness, her self-possession, her air of being a 
public character, her mixture of the girlish and the com- 
prehensive, startled and confounded her visitor, who felt 
that if he had come to gratify his curiosity he should be 
in danger of going away still more curious than satiated. 
She added in her gay, friendly, trustful tone the tone of 
facile intercourse, the tone in which happy, flower-crowned 
maidens may have talked to sunburnt young men in the 
golden age ' I am very familiar with your name ; Miss 
Chancellor has told me all about you.' 

'All about me?' Ransom raised his black eyebrows. 
' How could she do that ? She doesn't know anything 
about me !' 

' Well, she told me you are a great enemy to our move- 
ment. Isn't that true ? I think you expressed some un- 
favourable idea that day I met you at her house/ 

' If you regard me as an enemy, it's very kind of you to 
receive me.' 

' Oh, a great many gentlemen call/ Verena said, calmly 
and brightly. 'Some call simply to inquire. Some call 
because they have heard of me, or been present on some 
occasion when I have moved them. Every one is so 
interested.' 

' And you have been in Europe,' Ransom remarked, in 
a moment. 

' Oh yes, we went over to see if they were in advance. 
We had a magnificent time we saw all the leaders.' 

' The leaders ? ' Ransom repeated. 

' Of the emancipation of our sex. There are gentlemen 


there, as well as ladies. Olive had splendid introductions 
in all countries, and we conversed with all the earnest 
people. We heard much that was suggestive. And as for 
Europe !' and the young lady paused, smiling at him and 
ending in a happy sigh, as if there were more to say on the 
subject than she could attempt on such short notice. 

' I suppose it's very attractive/ said Ransom, encourag- 
ingly. 

' It's just a dream ! ' 

'  And did you find that they were in advance ?' 

'Well, Miss Chancellor thought they were. She was
