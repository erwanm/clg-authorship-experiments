diet ; an artist can't bring his visions to maturity unless 
he has a certain experience. You demand of us to be 
imaginative, and you deny us the things that feed the 
imagination. In labour we must be as passionate as the 
inspired sibyl ; in life we must be mere machines. It 
won't do ! When you have got an artist to deal with, 
you must take him as he is, good and bad together. 
I don't say they are pleasant fellows to know, or easy 
fellows to live with ; I don't say they satisfy themselves 
any better than other people. I only say that if you 
want them to produce you must let them conceive. If 
you want a bird to sing, you must not cover up its 
cage. Shoot them, the poor devils, drown them, ex 
terminate them, if you will, in the interest of public 
morality ; it may be morality would gain I daresay it 
would ! But if you suffer them to live, let them live 
on their own terms and according to their own inexor 
able needs !" 

Rowland burst out laughing. ( I have no wish whatever 
either to shoot you or to drown you !" he said. " Why 
defend yourself with such very big guns against a -warn 
ing offered you altogether in the interest of your freest 
development ? Do you really mean that you have an 
inexorable need of embarking on a flirtation with Miss 
Light ? a flirtation as to the felicity of which there may 
be differences of opinion, but which cannot at best, 



under the circumstances, be called innocent. Your last 
summer 's adventures were more so ! As for the terms 
on which you are to live, I had an idea you had arranged 
them otherwise !" 

"I have arranged nothing thank God! I don't 
pretend to arrange. I am young and ardent and inquisi 
tive, and I am preoccupied with that girl. That 's enough. 
I shall go as far as the fancy leads me. I am not afraid. 
Your genuine artist may be sometimes half a madman, 
but he 's not a coward !" 

" I see ; it 's a speculation. But suppose that in your 
speculation you should come to grief artistically as well 
as sentimentally?" 

" Come what come will ! If I m to fizzle out, the 
sooner I know it the better. Sometimes I half suspect 
it. But let me at least go out and reconnoitre for the 
enemy, and not sit here waiting for him, cudgelling my 
brains for ideas that won't come !" 

Do what he would, Rowland could not think of 
Roderick 's theory of unlimited experimentation, especially 
as applied in the case under discussion, as anything but 
a pernicious illusion. But he saw it was vain to discuss 
the matter, for inclination was powerfully on Roderick 's 
side. He laid his hand on the young man 's shoulder, 
looked at him a moment with troubled eyes, then shook 
his head mournfully and turned away. 

" I can't work any more," said Roderick. " You have 
upset me ! I ll go and stroll on the Pincian." And he 
tossed aside his working jacket and prepared himself for 
the street. As he was arranging his cravat before the 
glass something occurred to him which made him thought 
ful. He stopped a few moments afterwards as they were 
going out, with his hand on the door-knob. "You did 
from your own point of view an indiscreet thing," he said, 
to tell Miss Light of my engagement. " 

Rowland looked at him with a glance which was partly 
an interrogation, but partly also an admission. 



 

" If she 's the coquette you say," Roderick added, 
" you have given her a reason the more !" 

"And that 's the girl you propose to devote yourself 
to?" cried Rowland. 

" Oh, I don't say it, mind ! I only say that she 's the 
most interesting creature in the world ! The next time 
you mean to render me a service, pray give me notice 
beforehand ! " 

It was perfectly characteristic of Roderick that a fort 
night later he should have let his friend know that he 
depended upon him for society at Frascati as freely as if 
no irritating topic had ever been discussed between them. 
Rowland thought him generous, and he had at any rate 
a liberal faculty of forgetting that he had given you any 
reason to be displeased with him. It was equally char 
acteristic of Rowland that he complied with his friend 's 
summons without a moment 's hesitation. His cousin 
Cecilia had once told him that he was the dupe of his 
perverse benevolence. She put the case with too little 
favour, or too much, as the reader chooses ; it is certain 
at least that he had a constitutional tendency to mag 
nanimous interpretations. Nothing happened, however, 
to suggest to him that he was deluded in thinking that 
Roderick 's secondary impulses were wiser than his pri 
mary ones, and that the rounded total of his nature had 
a harmony perfectly attuned to the most amiable of its 
brilliant parts. Roderick 's humour, for the time, was 
pitched in a minor key ; he was lazy, listless, and melan 
choly, but he had never been so softly submissive. Winter 
had begun by the calendar, but the weather was divinely 
mild, and the two young men took long slow strolls on 
the hills, and lounged away the mornings in the villas. 
The villas at Frascati are delicious places, and replete with 
romantic suggestiveness. Roderick, as he had said, was 
meditating, and if a masterpiece was to come of his 
meditations Rowland was perfectly willing to bear him 
company and coax it along. But Roderick let him know 



i;o  XT. 

from the first that he was in a miserably sterile mood, 
and, cudgel his brains as he would, could think of nothing 
that would serve for the statue he was to make for Mr. 
Leavenworth. 

" It is worse out here than in Rome," he said, "for 
here I am face to face with the dead blank of my mind ! 
There I couldn't think of anything either, but there I 
found things to make me forget that I needed to think ! " 
This was as frank an allusion to Christina Light as could 
have been expected under the circumstances ; it seemed, 
indeed, to Rowland surprisingly frank a pregnant ex 
ample of his companion 's strangely irresponsible way of 
looking at harmful facts. Roderick was silent sometimes 
for hours, with a puzzled look on his face and a constant 
fold between his even eyebrows ; at other times he talked 
unceasingly, with a sort of impartial contemplative drawl. 
Rowland was half a dozen times on the point of asking 
him what was the matter with him ; he was afraid he 
was going to be ill. Roderick had taken a great fancy 
to the Villa Mondragone, and used to declaim fantastic 
compliments to it as they strolled in the winter sunshine 
on the great terrace which looks towards Tivoli and the 
iridescent Sabine mountains. He carried his volume of 
Ariosto in his pocket, and took it out every now and then 
to spout half a dozen stanzas to his companion. He was, 
as a general thing, very little of a reader ; but at intervals 
he would take a fancy to one of the classics and peruse it 
for a month in disjointed scraps. He had picked up 
Italian without study, and had a wonderfully proper 
accent, though in reading aloud he ruined the sense of 
half the lines he rolled off so sonorously. Rowland, who 
pronounced badly but understood everything, once said 
to him that Ariosto was not the poet for a man of his 
craft ; a sculptor should make a companion of Dante. 
So he lent him the Inferno, which he had brought with 
him, and advised him to look into it. Roderick took it 
with some eagerness ; perhaps it would brighten his wits. 



 

He returned it the next day with disgust ; he had found 
it intolerably depressing. 

" A sculptor should model as Dante writes you are 
right there," he said. " But when his genius is in eclipse 
Dante is a dreadfully smoky lamp. By what perversity 
of fate," he went on, "has it come about that I am a 
sculptor at all ? A sculptor is such a confoundedly special 
genius ; there are so few subjects he can treat, so few 
things in life that bear upon his work, so few moods in 
which he himself is inclined to it." (It may be noted 
that Rowland had heard him a dozen times affirm the 
flat reverse of all this.) " If I had only been a painter 
a little, quiet, docile matter-of-fact painter like our 
friend Singleton I should only have to open my Ariosto 
here to find a subject, to find colour and attitudes, stuffs 
and composition ; I should only have to look up from 
the page at that mouldy old fountain against the blue sky, 
at that cypress alley wandering away like a procession of 
priests in couples, at the crags and hollows of the Sabine 
hills, to find my picture begun ! Best of all would it be 
to be Ariosto himself or one of his brotherhood. Then 
everything in nature would give you a hint, and every 
form of beauty be part of your stock. You wouldn't have 
to look at things only to say with tears of rage half the 
time Oh yes, it 's wonderfully pretty, but what the 
devil can I do with it ? But a sculptor now ! That 's a 
pretty trade for a fellow who has got his living to make, 
and yet is so damnably constituted that he can't work to 
order, and considers that, aesthetically, clock ornaments 
don't pay ! You can't model the serge-coated cypresses, 
nor those mouldering old Tritons, and all the sunny sad 
ness of that dried-tip fountain ; you can't put the light 
into marble the lovely, caressing, consenting, Italian 
light that you get so much of for nothing ! Say that a 
dozen times &gt; in his life a man has a completely plastic 
vision a vision in which the imagination recognises a 
subject and the subject reacts on the imagination. It is 



 

a remunerative rate of work, and the intervals are com 
fortable !" 

One morning as the two young men were lounging on 
the sun-warmed grass at the foot of one of the slanting 
pines of the Villa Mondragone, Roderick delivered him 
self of a tissue of lugubrious speculations as to the 
possible mischances of one 's genius. "What if the 
watch should run down," he asked, "and you should 
lose the key ? What if you should wake up some morn 
ing and find it stopped inexorably, appallingly stopped ? 
Such things have been, and the poor devils to whom 
they happened have had to grin and bear it. The 
whole matter of genius is a mystery. It bloweth where 
it listeth, and we know nothing of its mechanism. If it 
gets out of order we can't mend it ; if it breaks down 
altogether we can't set it going again. We must let it 
choose its own pace and hold our breath lest it should 
lose its balance. It 's dealt out in different doses, in big 
cups and little, and when you have consumed your 
portion it 's as naif to ask for more as it was for Oliver 
Twist to ask for more porridge. Lucky for you if you 
have got one of the big cups ; we drink them down in 
the dark, and we can't tell their size until we tip them 
up and hear the last gurgle. Those of some men last 
for life ; those of others for a couple of years. Come, 
what are you grinning at?" he went on. " Nothing is 
more common than for an artist who has set out on his 
journey on a high-stepping horse to find himself all of a 
sudden dismounted and invited to go his way on foot. 
You can number them by the thousand the people of 
two or three successes ; the poor fellows whose candle 
burnt out in a night. Some of them groped their way 
along without it, some of them gave themselves up for 
blind and sat down by the wayside to beg. Who shall 
say that I am not one of these ? Who shall assure me 
that my credit is for an unlimited sum ? Nothing proves 
it, and I never claimed it ; or if I did, I did so in the 



 

mere boyish joy of shaking off the dust of Northampton ! 
If you believed so, my dear fellow, you did so at your 
own risk ! What am I, what are the best of us, but an 
experiment? Do I succeed do I fail? It doesn't 
depend on me ! I am prepared for failure. It won't 
be a disappointment, simply because I sha n't survive 
it. The end of my work shall be the end of my life. 
When I have played my last card I shall cease to care 
for the game. I am not making vulgar threats of 
suicide ; for destiny, I trust, won't add insult to injury 
by putting me to that abominable trouble. But I have 
a conviction that if the hour strikes here" and he tapped 
his forehead, " I shall disappear, dissolve, be carried off 
in a cloud ! For the past ten days I have had the 
vision of some such fate perpetually swimming before my 
eyes. My mind is like a dead calm in the tropics, and 
my imagination as motionless as the phantom ship in 
the Ancient Mariner ! " 

Rowland listened to this fine monologue, as he often 
had occasion to listen to Roderick 's flights of eloquence, 
with a number of mental restrictions. Both in gravity 
and in gaiety he said more than he meant, and you did 
him simple justice if you privately concluded that neither 
the glow of purpose nor the chill of despair was of so 
intense a character as his copiousness of illustration 
implied. The moods of an artist, his exultations and 
depressions, Rowland had often said to himself, were 
like the pen-flourishes a writing-master makes in the air 
when he begins to set his copy. He may bespatter you 
with ink, he may hit you in the eye, but he writes a 
magnificent hand. It was nevertheless true that at 
present poor Roderick gave unprecedented tokens of 
moral stagnation, and as for genius being held by the 
precarious tenure he had sketched, Rowland was at a 
loss to see where he could borrow the authority to con 
tradict him. He sighed to himself, and wished that his 
companion had a trifle more of little Sam Singleton 's 



 

vulgar steadiness. But then, was Sam Singleton a man 
of genius ? He answered that such reflections seemed to 
him unprofitable, not to say morbid ; that the proof of 
the pudding was in the eating ; that he did not know 
about bringing a dead genius back to life again, but that 
he was satisfied that vigorous effort was a cure for a great 
many ills that seemed far gone. "Don't bother about 
your mood," he said, "and don't believe there is any 
calm so dead that your own lungs can't ruffle it with a 
breeze. If you have work to do, don't wait to feel like 
it ; set to work and you "will feel like it." 

" Set to work and produce abortions !" cried Roderick, 
with ire. Preach that to others. Production with me 
must be either pleasure or nothing. As I said just now, 
I must either stay in the saddle or not go at all. I won't 
do second rate work ; I can't if I would. I have no 
cleverness apart from inspiration. I am not a Gloriani ! 
You are right," he added, after a while ; "this is unpro 
fitable talk, and it makes my head ache. I shall take a 
nap and see if I can dream of a bright idea or two. " 



XII. 

HE turned his face upward to the parasol of the great 
pine, closed his eyes, and in a short time forgot his 
sombre fancies. January though it was, the mild still 
ness seemed to vibrate with faint midsummer sounds. 
Rowland sat listening to them and wishing that, for the 
sake of their common comfort, Roderick 's temper had 
been graced with a certain absent ductility. He was 
brilliant, but was he, like many brilliant things, brittle ? 
Suddenly, to his musing sense, the soft atmospheric 
hum was overscored with distincter sounds. He heard 
voices beyond a mass of shrubbery, at the turn of a 



 

neighbouring path. In a moment one of them began 
to seem familiar, and an instant later a large white 
poodle emerged into view. He was slowly followed by 
his mistress. Miss Light paused a moment on seeing 
Rowland and his companion ; but though the former 
perceived that he was recognised she gave no greeting. 
Presently she walked directly towards him. He rose, 
and was on the point of waking Roderick, but she laid 
her finger on her lips and motioned him to forbear. 
She stood a moment looking at Roderick 's handsome 
slumber. 

"What delicious oblivion!" she said. " Happy 
man ! Stenterello " and she pointed to his face " wake 
him up !" 

The poodle extended a long pink tongue and began 
to lick Roderick 's cheek. 

"Why," asked Rowland, "if he is happy?" 

" Oh, I want companions in misery ! Besides, I want 
to show off my dog." Roderick roused himself, sat up 
and stared. By this time Mrs. Light had approached, 
walking with a gentleman on each side of her. One of 
these was the Cavaliere Giacosa ; the other was Prince 
Casamassima. " I should have liked to lie down on the 
grass and go to sleep," Christina added. " But it would 
have been unheard of." 

"Oh, not quite," said the Prince, in English, in a 
tone of great precision. "There was already a Sleeping 
Beauty in the Wood !" 

"Charming!" cried Mrs. Light. "Do you hear 
that, my dear?" 

"When the Prince says a brilliant thing it would be 
a pity to lose it," said the young girl. " Your servant, 
sir !" And she smiled at him with a grace that might 
have reassured him if he had thought her compliment 
ambiguous. 

Roderick meanwhile had risen to his feet, and Mrs. 
Light began to exclaim on the oddity of their meeting, 



 

and to explain that the clay was so lovely that she had 
been charmed with the idea of spending it in the country. 
And who would ever have thought of finding Mr. Mallet 
and Mr. Hudson sleeping under a tree ? 

"Oh, I beg your pardon; I was not sleeping," said 
Rowland. 

" Don't you know that Mr. Mallet is Mr. Hudson 's 
sheep-dog?" asked Christina. "He was mounting 
guard to keep away the wolves." 

"To indifferent purpose, madam!" said Rowland,
