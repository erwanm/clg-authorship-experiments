ness; there is something mild and smooth, like the 
stillness, the deafness, of an octogenarian, even in its 
rudeness of ornament, and it has become insensible 
to differences of a century or two. The cathedral 
interested me much less than Our Lady the Great, 
and I have not the spirit to go into statistics about it. 
It is not statistical to say that the cathedral stands 
half-way down the hill of Poitiers, in a quiet and 
grass-grown place, with an approach of crooked lanes 
and blank garden-walls, and that its most striking 
dimension is the width of its fagade. This width is 
extraordinary, but it fails, somehow, to give nobleness 
to the edifice, which looks within (Murray makes the 
remark) like a large public hall. There are a nave 
and two aisles, the latter about as high as the nave; 
and there are some very fearful modern pictures, 
which you may see much better than you usually see 
those specimens of the old masters that lurk in glow 
ing side-chapels, there being no fine old glass to dif 
fuse a kindly gloom. The sacristan of the cathedral 
showed me something much better than all this bright 
bareness; he led me a short distance out of it to the 
small Temple de Saint- Jean, which is the most curious 
object at Poitiers. It is an early Christian chapel, 
one of the earliest in France; originally, it would seem, 
that is, in the sixth or seventh century, a bap 
tistery, but converted into a church while the Christian 
era was still comparatively young. The Temple de 
Saint- Jean is therefore a monument even more vener- 



able than Notre Dame la Grande, and that numbness 
of age which I imputed to Notre Dame ought to reside 
in still larger measure in its crude and colorless little 
walls. I call them crude, in spite of their having 
been baked through by the centuries, only because, 
although certain rude arches and carvings are let 
into them, and they are surmounted at either end with 
a small gable, they have (so far as I can remember) 
little fascination of surface. Notre Dame is still ex 
pressive, still pretends to be alive; but the Temple 
has delivered its message, and is completely at rest. 
It retains a kind of atrium, on the level of the street, 
from which you descend to the original floor, now un 
covered, but buried for years under a false bottom. 
A semicircular apse was, apparently at the time of its 
conversion into a church, thrown out from the east 
wall. In the middle is the cavity of the old baptismal 
font. The walls and vaults are covered with traces 
of extremely archaic frescos, attributed, I believe, to 
the twelfth century. These vague, gaunt, staring 
fragments of figures are, to a certain extent, a reminder 
of some of the early Christian churches in Rome; they 
even faintly recalled to me the great mosaics of 
Ravenna. The Temple de Saint- Jean has neither the 
antiquity nor the completeness of those extraordinary 
monuments, nearly the most impressive in Europe; 
but, as one may say, it is very well for Poitiers. 

Not far from it, in a lonely corner which was ani 
mated for the moment by the vociferations of several 
old women who were selling tapers, presumably for 



  

the occasion of a particular devotion, is the graceful 
romanesque church erected in the twelfth century to 
Saint Radegonde, a lady who found means to be a 
saint even in the capacity of a Merovingian queen. 
It bears a general resemblance to Notre Dame la 
Grande, and, as I remember it, is corrugated in some 
what the same manner with porous-looking carvings; 
but I confess that what I chiefly recollect is the row 
of old women sitting in front of it, each with a tray 
of waxen tapers in her lap, and upbraiding me for 
my neglect of the opportunity to offer such a tribute to 
the saint. I know not whether this privilege is oc 
casional or constant; within the church there was no 
appearance of a festival, and I see that the name- 
day of Saint Radegonde occurs in August, so that the 
importunate old women sit there always, perhaps, and 
deprive of its propriety the epithet I just applied to 
this provincial corner. In spite of the old women, 
however, I suspect that the place is lonely; and in 
deed it is perhaps the old women that have made the 
desolation. 

The lion of Poitiers, in the eyes of the natives, is 
doubtless the Palais de Justice, in the shadow of which 
the statue-guarded hotel, just mentioned, erects itself; 
and the gem of the court-house, which has a prosy 
modern front, with pillars and a high flight of steps, 
is the curious salle des pas perdus, or central hall, out 
of which the different tribunals open. This is a 
feature of every French court-house, and seems the 
result of a conviction that a palace of justice the 





French deal in much finer names than we should be 
in some degree palatial. The great hall at Poitiers 
has a long pedigree, as its walls date back to the 
twelfth century, and its open wooden roof, as well as 
the remarkable trio of chimney-pieces at the right end 
of the room as you enter, to the fifteenth. The three 
tall fireplaces, side by side, with a delicate gallery 
running along the top of them, constitute the originality 
of this ancient chamber, and make one think of the 
groups that must formerly have gathered there, of 
all the wet boot-soles, the trickling doublets, the 
stiffened fingers, the rheumatic shanks, that must have 
been presented to such an incomparable focus of 
heat. To-day, I am afraid, these mighty hearts are 
forever cold; justice is probably administered with the 
aid of a modern caloriftre, and the walls of the palace 
are perforated with regurgitating tubes. Behind and 
above the gallery that surmounts the three fireplaces 
are high Gothic windows, the tracery of which masks, 
in some sort, the chimneys; and in each angle of this 
and of the room to the right and left of the trio of 
chimneys, is an open-work spiral staircase, ascending 
to I forget where; perhaps to the roof of the edifice. 
This whole side of the salle is very lordly, and seems 
to express an unstinted hospitality, to extend the 
friendliest of all invitations, to bid the whole world 
come and get warm. It was the invention of John, 
Duke of Berry and Count of Poitou, about 1395. I 
give this information on the authority of the Guide- 
Joanne, from which source I gather much other curious 



  

learning; as, for instance, that it was in this building, 
when it had surely a very different front, that Charles VII. 
was proclaimed king, in 1422; and that here Jeanne 
Dare was subjected, in 1429, to the inquisition of 
certain doctors and matrons. 

The most charming thing at Poitiers is simply the 
Promenade de Blossac, a small public garden at one 
end of the flat top of the hill. It has a happy look 
of the last century (having been arranged at that 
period), and a beautiful sweep of view over the sur 
rounding country, and especially of the course of the 
little river Clain, which winds about a part of the base 
of the big mound of Poitiers. The limit of this dear 
little garden is formed, on the side that turns away 
from the town, by the rampart erected in the fourteenth 
century, and by its big semicircular bastions. This 
rampart, of great length, has a low parapet; you look 
over it at the charming little vegetable-gardens with 
which the base of the hill appears exclusively to be 
garnished. The whole prospect is delightful, especially 
the details of the part just under the walls, at the end 
of the walk. Here the river makes a shining twist, 
which a painter might have invented, and the side of 
the hill is terraced into several ledges, a sort of 
tangle of small blooming patches and little pavilions 
with peaked roofs and green shutters. It is idle to 
attempt to reproduce all this in words; it should be 
reproduced only in water-colors. The reader, how 
ever, will already have remarked that disparity in 
these ineffectual pages, which are pervaded by the 





attempt to sketch without a palette or brushes. He will 
doubtless, also, be struck with the grovelling vision 
which, on such a spot as the ramparts of Poitiers, 
peoples itself with carrots and cabbages rather than 
with images of the Black Prince and the captive king. 
I am not sure that in looking out from the Promenade 
de Blossac you command the old battle-field; it is 
enough that it was not far off, and that the great rout 
of Frenchmen poured into the walls of Poitiers, leav 
ing on the ground a number of the fallen equal to 
the little army (eight thousand) of the invader. I did 
think of the battle. I wondered, rather helplessly, 
Avhere it had taken place; and I came away (as the 
reader will see from the preceding sentence) without 
finding out. This indifference, however, was a result 
rather of a general dread of military topography than 
of a want of admiration of this particular victory, 
which I have always supposed to be one of the most 
brilliant on record. Indeed, I should be almost 
ashamed, and very much at a loss, to say what light 
it was that this glorious day seemed to me to have 
left forever on the horizon, and why the very name of 
the place had always caused my blood gently to tingle. 
It is carrying the feeling of race to quite inscrutable 
lengths when a vague American permits himself an 
emotion because more than five centuries ago, on 
French soil, one rapacious Frenchman got the better 
of another. Edward was a Frenchman as well as 
John, and French were the cries that urged each of 
the hosts to the fight. French is the beautiful motto 



  

graven round the image of the Black Prince, as he 
lies forever at rest in the choir of Canterbury: a la 
mort ne pensai-je mye. Nevertheless, the victory of 
Poitiers declines to lose itself in these considerations; 
the sense of it is a part of our heritage, the joy of it 
a part of our imagination, and it filters down through 
centuries and migrations till it titillates a New Yorker 
who forgets in his elation that he happens at that 
moment to be enjoying the hospitality of France. It 
was something done, I know not how justly, for Eng 
land; and what was done in the fourteenth century 
for England was done also for New York. 



XVIII. 

IF it was really for the sake of the Black Prince 
that I had stopped at Poitiers (for my prevision of 
Notre Dame la Grande and of the little temple of St. 
John was of the dimmest), I ought to have stopped at 
Angouleme for the sake of David and Eve Sechard, 
of Lucien de Rubempre and of Madame de Bargeton, 
who when she w r ore a toilette etudtie sported a Jewish 
turban ornamented with an Eastern brooch, a scarf of 
gauze, a necklace of cameos, and a robe of "painted 
muslin," whatever that may be; treating herself to 
these luxuries out of an income of twelve thousand 
francs. The persons I have mentioned have not that 
vagueness of identity which is the misfortune of his 
torical characters; they are real, supremely real, thanks 





to their affiliation to the great Balzac, who had invented 
an artificial reality which was as much better than the 
vulgar article as mock-turtle soup is than the liquid it 
emulates. The first time I read "Les Illusions Perdues" 
I should have refused to believe that I was capable of 
passing the old capital of Anjou without alighting to 
visit the Houmeau. But we never know what we are 
capable of till we are tested, as I reflected when I 
found myself looking back at Angouleme from the 
window of the train , just after we had emerged from 
the long tunnel that passes under the town. This 
tunnel perforates the hill on which, like Poitiers, 
Angouleme rears itself, and which gives it an eleva 
tion still greater than that of Poitiers. You may have 
a tolerable look at the cathedral without leaving the 
railway-carriage; for it stands just above the tunnel, 
and is exposed, much foreshortened, to the spectator 
below. There is evidently a charming walk round the 
plateau of the town, commanding those pretty views 
of which Balzac gives an account. But the   train 
whirled me away, and these are my only impressions. 
The truth is that I had no need, just at that moment, 
of putting myself into communication with Balzac; for 
opposite to me in the compartment were a couple of 
figures almost as vivid as the actors in the "Comedie 
Humaine." One of these was a very genial and dirty 
old priest, and the other was a reserved and concen 
trated young monk, the latter (by which I mean a 
monk of any kind) being a rare sight to-day in France. 
This young man, indeed, was mitigatedly monastic. 



  

He had a big brown frock and cowl, but he had also 
a shirt and a pair of shoes; he had, instead of a 
hempen scourge round his waist, a stout leather thong, 
and he carried with him a very profane little valise. 
He also read, from beginning to end, the "Figaro" 
which the old priest, who had done the same, presented 
to him; and he looked altogether as if, had he not 
been a monk, he would have made a distinguished 
officer of engineers. When he was not reading the 
"Figaro" he was conning his breviary or answering, 
with rapid precision and with a deferential but dis 
couraging dryness, the frequent questions of his com 
panion, who was of quite another type. This worthy 
had a bored, good-natured, unbuttoned, expansive 
look; was talkative, restless, almost disreputably human. 
He was surrounded by a great deal of small luggage, 
and had scattered over the carriage his books, his 
papers, the fragments of his lunch, and the contents 
of an extraordinary bag, which he kept beside him 
a kind of secular reliquary and which appeared to 
contain the odds and ends of a lifetime, as he took 
from it successively a pair of slippers, an old padlock 
(which evidently didn 't belong to it), an opera-glass, a 
collection of almanacs, and a large sea-shell, which he 
very carefully examined. I think that if he had not 
been afraid of the young monk, who was so much 
more serious than he, he would have held the shell to 
his ear, like a child. Indeed, he was a very childish 
and delightful old priest, and his companion evidently 
thought him most frivolous. But I liked him the better 





of the two. He was not a country cure, but an eccle 
siastic of some rank, who had seen a good deal both 
of the church and of the world; and if I too had not 
been afraid of his colleague, who read the "Figaro" 
as seriously as if it had been an encyclical, I should 
have entered into conversation with him. 

All this while I was getting on to Bordeaux, where 
I permitted myself to spend three days. I am afraid 
I have next to nothing to show for them, and that 
there would be little profit in lingering on this episode, 
which is the less to be justified as I had in former 
years examined Bordeaux attentively enough. It con 
tains a very good hotel, an hotel not good enough, 
however, to keep you there for its own sake. For the 
rest, Bordeaux is a big, rich, handsome, imposing com 
mercial town, with long rows of fine old eighteenth- 
century houses, which overlook the yellow Garonne. I 
have spoken of the quays of Nantes as fine, but those 
of Bordeaux have a wider sweep and a still more 
architectural air. The appearance of such a pDrt as 
this makes the Anglo-Saxon tourist blush for the sor 
did water-fronts of Liverpool and New York, which, 
with their larger activity, have so much more reason 
to be stately. Bordeaux gives a great impression of 
prosperous industries, and suggests delightful ideas, 
images of prune-boxes and bottled claret. As the focus 
of distribution of the best wine in the world, it is in 
deed a sacred city, dedicated to the worship of 
Bacchus in the most discreet form. The country all 
about it is covered with precious vineyards, sources of 



  

fortune to their owners and of satisfaction to distant 
consumers; and as you look over to the hills beyond 
the Garonne you see them in the autumn sunshine, 
fretted with the rusty richness of this or that immortal 
clos. But the principal picture, within the town, is that 
of the vast curving quays, bordered with houses that 
look like the hotels of farmers-general of the last cen 
tury, and of the wide, tawny river, crowded with ship 
ping and spanned by the largest of bridges. Some of 
the types on the water-side are of the sort that arrest 
a sketcher, figures of stalwart, brown-faced Basques, 
such as I had seen of old in great numbers at Biarritz, 
with their loose circular caps, their white sandals, their 
air of walking for a wager. Never was a tougher, a 
harder race. They are not mariners, nor watermen, 
but, putting questions of temper aside, they are the 
best possible dock-porters. "II 's y fait un commerce 
terrible," a douanier said to me, as he looked up and 
down the interminable docks; and such a place has 
indeed much to say of the wealth, the capacity for 
production, of France, the bright, cheerful, smokeless 
industry of the wonderful country which produces, 
above all, the agreeable things of life, and turns even 
its defeats and revolutions into gold. The whole town 
has an air of almost depressing opulence, an appear 
ance which culminates in the great place which sur 
rounds the Grand-Theatre, an establishment in the 
highest style, encircled with columns, arcades, lamps, 
gilded cafes. One feels it to be a monument to the 
virtue of the well-selected bottle. If I had not for- 





bidden myself to linger, I should venture to insist on 
this, and, at the risk of being considered fantastic, 
trace an analogy between good claret and the best 
qualities of the French mind; pretend that there is a 
taste of sound Bordeaux in all the happiest manifes 
tations of that fine organ, and that, correspondingly, 
there is a touch of French reason, French complete 
ness, in a glass of Pontet-Canet. The danger of such 
an excursion would lie mainly in its being so open to 
the reader to take the ground from under my feet by 
saying that good claret doesn 't exist. To this I should 
have no reply whatever. I should be unable to tell 
him where to find it. I certainly didn 't find it at
