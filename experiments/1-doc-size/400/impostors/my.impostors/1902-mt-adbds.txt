him down and fetch him back, just 
for meanness. 

The people could not understand 
this. The boy's miseries went steadily 
on, week after week. It is quite 
likely that the people would have 

Qf understood if they had known how 

he was employing his spare time. 
He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; 
and there, nights, he nursed his bruis- 
es and his humiliations, and studied 
and studied over a single problem — 
how he could murder Flint Buckner 
and not be found out. It was the 
only joy he had in life; these hours 
were the only ones in the twenty-four 
which he looked forward to with eager- 
ness and spent in happiness. 

He thought of poison. No — that 
would not serve; the inquest would 
reveal where it was procured and who 
had procured it. He thought of a shot 
in the back in a lonely place when 
Flint would be homeward-boiind at 
midnight — his unvarying hour for 
the trip. No — somebody might be 
near, and catch him. He thought 
of stabbing him in his sleep. No — 
he might strike an inefficient blow, 
and Flint would seize him. He ex- 
amined a hundred different ways — 
none of them would answer; for in 
even the very obscurest and secretest 
of them there was always the fatal _ 

defect of a risk, a chance, a possible 
risk in that he might be found out. He 
would have none of that. 

But he was patient, endlessly 
patient. There was no hurry, he 
said to himself. He would never 
leave Flint till he left him a corpse; 
there was no hurry — he would find 
the way. It was somewhere, and 
he would endure shame and pain 
and misery until he found it. Yes, 
somewhere there was a way which 
'oenge would leave not a trace, not even the 
faintest clew to the murderer — there 
was no hurry — he would find that 
way, and then — oh, then, it would 
just be good to be alive! Meantime 
he would diligently keep up his rep- 
utation for meekness; and also, as 
always theretofore, he would allow 
no one to hear him say a resentful 
or offensive thing about his oppressor. 
Two days before the before-men- 
tioned October morning Flint had 
bought some things, and he and Fet- 
lock had brought them home to Flint's 
cabin: a fresh box of candles, which 
they put in the corner; a tin can of mlteHal 
blasting-powder, which they placed 
upon the candle-box; a keg of blast- 
ing-powder, which they placed under 
Flint's bunk; a huge coil of fuse, 
which they hung on a peg. Fet- 
lock reasoned that Flint's mining 
operations had outgrown the pick, 
and that blasting was about to begin 
now. He had seen blasting done, 
and he had a notion of the process, 
but he had never helped in it. His 
conjecture was right — blasting - time 
had come. In the morning the pair 
carried fuse, drills, and the powder- 
can to the shaft; it was now eight 
feet deep, and to get into it and out 
of it a short ladder was used. They 
descended, and by command Fetlock 
ls held the drill— without any instruc- 
tions as to the right way to hold it — 
and Flint proceeded to strike. The 
sledge came down; the drill sprang 
out of Fetlock's hand, almost as a 
matter of course. 

"You mangy son of a nigger, is 
that any way to hold a drill? Pick 
it up! Stand it up! There — hold 
fast. D you! I'll teach youi'' 

At the end of an hour the drilling 
was finished. 

"Now, then, charge it." 

The boy started to pour in the pow- 
der. 

"Idiot!'' . 

A heavy bat on the jaw laid the 
lad out. 


"Get up! You can't lie snivelling 
there. Now, then, stick in the fuse 
first. Now put in the powder. Hold 
on, hold on! Are you going to fill 
the hole all up? Of all the sap-headed 
milksops I — Put in some dirt! Put 
in some gravel! Tamp it down! 
Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! 
get out of the way!'' He snatched 



the iron and tamped the charge him-  

self, meantime cursing and blaspheming 
like a fiend. Then he fired the 
fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and 
ran fifty yards away. Fetlock follow- 
ing. They stood waiting a few min- 
utes, then a great volume of smoke 
and rocks burst high into the air 
with a thunderous explosion; after 
a little there was a shower of descending 
stones; then all was serene 
again. 

"I wish to God you'd been in itl'' 
remarked the master. 

They went down the shaft, cleaned 
it out, drilled another hole, and put 
in another charge. 
Timing "Look herel How much fuse are 

fuse yo proposing to waste? Don't you 

know how to time a fuse?" 

"No, sir." 

"You don't! Well, if you don't 
beat anything I ever saw!" 

He climbed out of the shaft and 
spoke down: 

" Well, idiot, are you going to be all 
day? Cut the fuse and Hght it!" 

The trembling creature began, 

"If you please, sir, I — " 

" You talk back to me ? Cut it and 
light it!" 

The boy cut and lit. 

"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! 
I wish you were in — " 

In his rage he snatched the ladder 
out of the shaft and ran. The boy 
was aghast. 

"Oh, my God! Help! Help! Oh, 
save me!" he implored. "Oh, what 
can I do! What can I do!" 

He backed against the wall as 

tightly as he could; the sputtering 

fuse frightened the voice out of him; 

his breath stood still; he stood gazing 

and impotent; in two seconds, three 

seconds, four, he would be flying se to 

death 
toward the sky torn to fragments. 

Then he had an inspiration. He 
sprang at the fuse and severed the 
inch of it that was left above ground, 
and was saved. 

He sank down limp and half life- 
less with fright, his strength all 
gone; but he muttered with a deep 

joy: 
"He has learnt me! I knew there 

fa,.   way, if I would wait' 

After a matter of five minutes Buck- 
ner stole to the shaft, looking wor- 
ried and uneasy, and peered down 
into it. He took in the situation; he 
saw what had happened. He low- 
ered the ladder, and the boy dragged 
himself weakly up it. He was very 
white. His appearance added some- 
thing to Buckner's uncomfortable 
regret and sympathy which sat upon 
him awkwardly from lack of prac- 
tice: 

"It was an accident, you know. 
Don't say anything about it to any- 
body ; I was excited, and didn't notice 
what I was doing. You're not look- 
ing well; you've worked enough for 
to-day ; go down to my cabin and eat 
what you want, and rest. It's just 
an accident, you know, on account 
of my being excited." 

"It scared me' said the lad, as he ' 
started away; "but I learnt something,
so I don't mind it." 

"Damned easy to please!" muttered 
Buckner, following him with his eye. 
"I wonder if he'll tell? Mightn't 
he? ... I wish it had killed him." 



The boy took no advantage of 
his holiday in the matter of rest- 
Fggf ing; he employed it in work, eager 
. and feverish and happy work. A 

thick growth of chaparral extended 
down the mountain - side clear to 
Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's 
labor was done in the dark intrica- 
cies of that stubborn growth ; the rest 
of it was done in his own shanty. 
At last all was complete, and he 
said: 

"If he's got any suspicions that 
I'm going to tell on him, he won't 
keep them long, to-morrow. He will 
see that I am the same milksop as I 
always was — all day and the next. 
And the day after to-morrow night 
there'll be an end of him, and nobody 

will ever guess who finished him up 
nor how it was done. He dropped 
me the idea his own self, and that's 
odd." 


HE next day came and 
went. 

It is now almost mid- 
night, and in five min- 
utes the new morning will begin. The 
scene is in the tavern billiard-room. 
Rough men in rough clothing, slouch 
hats, breeches stuffed into boot-tops, 
some with vests, none with coats, are 
grouped about the boiler -iron stove, 
which has ruddy cheeks and is dis- 
tributing a grateful warmth ; the bill- 
iard-balls are clacking; there is no 
other sound — that is, within ; the wind 
is fitfully moaning without. The men 
look bored; also expectant. A hulk- 
ing, broad-shouldered miner, of mid- 
dle age, with grizzled whiskers, and 
an unfriendly eye set in an imsociable 
face, rises, slips a coil of fuse upon 
his arm, gathers up some other per- 
sonal properties, and departs without 
word or greeting to anybody. It is 
Flint Buckner. As the door closes 
behind him a buzz of talk breaks 
out. 

"The regularest man that ever 
was,'' said Jake Parker, the black- method 
smith ; *" you can tell when it's twelve 
just by him leaving, without looking 
at your Waterbury." 

"And it's the only virtue he's got, 
as fur as I know' said Peter Hawes, 
miner. 

" He's just a blight on this society' 

on society said _ Wells - Far go's man, Ferguson 
" If I was running this shop I'd make 
him say something, some time or 
other, or vamos the ranch." This 
with a suggestive glance at the bar- 
keeper, who did not choose to see it, 
since the man under discussion was 
a good customer, and went home 
pretty well set up, every night, with 
refreshments furnished from the bar. 

"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, 
"does any of you boys ever recollect 
of him asking you to take a drink?" 

''Him? Flint Buckner? Oh, 
Laura!" 

This sarcastic rejoinder came in a 
spontaneous general outburst in one 
form of words or another from the 
crowd. After a brief silence, Pat 
Riley, miner, said: 

"He's the 15 -puzzle, that cuss. The 

And his boy's another one. I can't puzzle 
make them out." 

"Nor anybody else," said Ham 
Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles,
how are you going to rank up 
that other one? When it comes to 
A I right-down solid mysteriousness, 
he laj's over both of them. Easy — 
don't he?" 

"You bet!" 

Everybody said it. Every man but 
one. He was the new-comer — Pe- 
terson. He ordered the drinks all 
round, and asked who No. 3 might 
be. All answered at once, ''Archy 
Stillman!'' 

"Is he a mystery?'' asked Peter- 


"Is te a mystery? Is Archy Still- 
man a mystery?'' said Wells-Fargo's 
man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth 
dimension's foolishness to him." 

For Ferguson was learned. 

Peterson wanted to hear all about 
him; everybody wanted to tell him; 
everybody began. But Billy Stevens, 
the barkeeper, called the house to or- 
der, and said one at a time was best. 
He distributed the drinks, and ap- 
pointed Ferguson to lead. Fergu- 
son said: 

"Well, he's a boy. And that is 
just about all we know about him. 


You can pump him till you are tired; 
it ain't any use; you won't get any- 
thing. At least about his intentions, 
or line of business, or where he's 
from, and such things as that. And 
as for getting at the nature and get- 
up of his main big chief mystery, 
why, he'll just change the subject, 
that's all. You can gtiess till you're 
black in the face— it's your privilege 
— but suppose you do, where do you 
arrive at ? Nowhere, as near as I 
can make out." 

" What is his big chief one?" 
"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. 
Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take 
your choice — grown-ups, twenty-five; 
children and servants, half price. Now
