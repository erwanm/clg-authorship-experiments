It did not appear a bit strange to me. Papa, mamma, and 
Walter were delighted. Mr. Otis bought a house only a 



 

little distance from this, and we are to go to housekeeping 
immediately. The engagement has been short, but I think 
it quite as well. I .am nervous, and want it all over. I 
fancied it would be so pleasant to have you to help me 
select furniture, dresses, and all that, for mamma can go 
out so little." 

" I wish you had not made this engagement. Suppose, 
instead, I help you to break it?" 

" No." She turned suddenly pale. " I believe I am 
right. I mean to go on." Then, in a changed tone, "You 
see now, dear, why I have not written about it. I could 
not have explained all." 

" I don't wonder, surely. When can I see Mr. Otis ? I 
shall make up my mind then whether it is best to forbid 
the banns or not." 

" He is in every day or evening. I think he is rather 
nervous and shy before strangers ; but it soon wears off. 
I want you to like him. And, Sydnie, please don't talk 
this way before mamma; she believes that I am going to 
be very happy." 

" And I know you are not : is that it ? " 

" No, you don't ; you can't know what is alone in God's 
keeping." 

She uttered this with a curious, latent energy. Just then 
we were called to lunch. 

. I sat at the table, revolving Anne's story in my mind. 
It was so odd that she, of all other girls, should tell it. 
Looking in some women's faces you seem to read that 
they were born for a happy, contented love, to be the 
centre of a cheerful home, and have children growing up 
around them. She, with her pretty, motherly ways, her 
delicate tastes, fine, sensitive feelings, but not high or wide 
range of intellect, appeared just the one for such a life. 
Would not coldness freeze her into a stiff formalism, crush 



 

her tender, yearning soul, that needed bluest skies for its 
blossoming? 

The children came home presently : they were just the 
kind of little ones to make friends with. I was electrify- 
ing them with some rather noisy selections from Trovatore, 
when Anne summoned me to the drawing-room. Mr. Otis 
had come, and wished her to go with him and select some 
paper for the new house, if she and her friend were not 
too tired. So I went in for a brief introduction. Such 
things are invariably awkward, and I forgave him for being 
stiff. He certainly looked old for his years, as he was but 
little beyond thirty. Not prepossessing; merely a plain, 
quiet gentleman, the kind of person one might suppose 
would make a good, trusty friend, but not an enthusiastic 
lover. 

His taste was certainly fine, and he paid little regard to 
expense. He was so desirous of pleasing Anne, that he 
would have purchased half the warehouse, and had his 
walls adorned every week in a different style. She hesi- 
tated ; in fact, I suspected she took no great interest in 
the matter. She was not happy. 

What a strange world it is ! so very few coming to the 
highest enjoyment. Some lives full of straining effort and 
self-denial, and yet never attaining the peace that crowns 
unconscious love, that should come as a birthright to all 
earnest souls. 




CHAPTER X. 

" I never 
Could tread a single pleasure under foot." 

KOUKKT BROWNING. 

ANNE was really bright and gny at the dinner-table. A 
sense of relief seemed to pervade her. There was a little 
talk about the new house, and her face flushed to a pretty 
and becoming color. I half fancied her happy, after all. 

I was playing for Walter in the drawing-room, when we 
were both staitled by the entrance of a visitor. Walter 
did the honors of the introduction a Mr. Charming, who 
attracted me at the very first glance a handsome man 
of five and twenty, who recalled to one the statue of Anti- 
nous. He reminded me curiously enough of Mrs. Lawrence. 
The same slender, subtile grace ; the light, airy motion ; 
the silken, soft, glittering hair, and summery blue eyes, 
large lidded and languid. His features were exquisitely 
cut ; a straight, Grecian nose, a beautifully-rounded chin, 
and mouth as perfect as an infant's. The full, scarlet lips 
were curved and smiling, and if there was any defect in 
his face, it was that the upper lip looked too short and too 
Weak for a man ; but this one would hardly cavil at. 

He glanced at me after the introduction, and I could not 
help experiencing a peculiar thrill of power; as if he were 
paying unconscious homage, and so delicately done withal, 
that one could not be offended. 

Anne entered. He rose and shook hands with her, 
calling a bright flush to her cheek. 



 

"I am positively disappointed," she said. "I wanted 
the pleasure of presenting you to Miss Adriance." 

"Well, suppose we have it over again," and he laughed. 
A string of tiny bells put in motion could not have been 
more musical. 

" And we have been so much engaged to-day that I have 
not told her a word about you." 

"Then I must be judged upon my own merits. Miss 
Adriance, please be merciful." 

" O!" Anne said, with a little impatient gesture. "But 
a few evenings ago I learned that Mr. Channing and Mr. 
St. John " 

She paused, for there flitted across Mr. Channing's face 
such a comical, half-deprecating expression. 

" Were connections. I'll finish the sentence, Miss Suth- 
erland, and Miss Adriance must judge who is to be 
commiserated." 

This air of gay audacity sat wonderfully well upon him. 

" I confess you brought Mrs. Lawrence to my mind," I 
said, feeling pleased and interested. 

" Thank you. I don't aspire to the gloomily grand, as 
does my magnificent cousin Stuart. Isabelle is a charming 
woman, but she displayed a good deal of courage when she 
undertook to humanize her brother. Miss Anne said he 
was your guardian." 

"Isn't it odd?" Anne exclaimed. "I was quite startled 
w T hen I made the discovery, for I have been acquainted 
with Mr. Channing a long while, and known you so in- 
timately, too." Then she colored afresh, and looked 
strangely conscious. 

" And you are really relatives?" I said, recovering from 
my surprise. 

" Honestly and truly, on our mother's side. Though I 
suspect St. John long ago disowned all relationship with 



 

such a gay fellow; he's so miserably grave and severe. 
Doesn't he sometimes threaten to shut you up in a dark 
closet?" 

"No," I answered, laughingly. "I have found Laurel- 
wood a very enjoyable place." 

" Perhaps he comes down from his pedestal occasionally. 
I made them a visit when Isabelle first went there, and I 
assure you I was glad to escape. I cannot endure those 
morose and bitter people who shroud themselves con- 
tinually in sackcloth, and will not be content unless they 
see their neighbors sitting in ashes. Life is such a delight- 
ful thing to me! If there is a stray gleam of sunshine T 
want to be in it. I enjoy summer bloom and beauty, 
without bewailing the fact that it must fade when winter 
comes." 

His voice was so purely musical, and his face summer in 
itself. One listened as to chords played perfectly. 

I had found Mr. St. John bitter, but I was half ashamed 
to confess it; so I said, 

" We have been rather gay and dissipated all winter." 

" Then a change has certainly come over Giant Despair. 
Miss Adriance, you amaze me! Doesn't St. John preach 
you homilies upon the waste of time spent in such frivol- 
ities?" 

" I haven't been sermonized vry seriously as yet." 

" Wonders will never cease. And though I wouldn't 
shadow your bright visions, I am afraid I have little faith 
in his conversion." 

Presently we rambled on to something else. He never 
wore out a theme, or allowed his listeners to weary of it. 
He was at home everywhere. Any trivial subject blossomed 
in grace and beauty at his touch. Choice bits of sentiment 
floated out on the wave of conversation, sparkling like the 
changeful sea in a midday sunshine. Poetry, music, art, 



 

nothing came amiss to him. One could not pause to analyze, but enjoyed without cavilling, as one does the richness 
of tropical scenery. It gave me a curious sensation, as if I 
had remained too long in an over-fragrant conservatory. 

Before he went away he made an engagement to take 
us to visit a gallery of paintings then on exhibition. All 
the evening Anne had been bright and winsome, treating 
him with the familiarity of a brother. 

After he had gone, I lingered by the piano while she 
collected stray sheets of music. 

"You like him," she began, in a confident tone. 

" How could any one help it?" I said, honestly. 

" I'm so glad. lie is to stand with you." 

"What an odd circumstance! He ought to stand in 
another capacity, Anne. You have been a different being 
this evening." 

" There's something inspiriting about him, like wine. 
Perhaps I am too easily impressed." 

I took her face between my hands. " Confess, Anne," I 
said, "that you could have loved this man." 

She struggled to free herself. "If I had met him now 
for the first time, I don't know what effect he might have 
upon me; but I have known him from childhood." 

"And how have you escaped loving him?" 

" I do not think he ever loved me." She said it very 
simply and honestly. 

" But women do not always wait for that." 

" I don't know that I quite understand it myself, only I 
can fed that we should never do for each other." 

"Why?" I asked in astonishment. 

" It seems as if he would need a strong and powerful 
charm to hold him. He would want something rare and 
startling, a bud one day, a blossom the next, and ever after 
a different kind of fruit. I am grave by nature, and have 



 

but little variety. I should give all at first, and though it 
might grow more precious to some, I can fancy others 
tiring of it." 

" What an odd girl ! Do you think him fickle ?" 

" He has not proved fickle in friendship." Her eyes 
wandered from mine as she uttered this. 

" There's some mystery about you two people. I can't 
imagine how you could consent to marry that unattractive 
Mr. Otis when you contrasted him with Mr. Channing." 

" I didn't contrast them. Mr. Channing has been away 
nearly all winter. I cannot make you understand just the 
kind of friends we have been. He is distantly connected 
with some cousins of mine, whom I used to visit frequently. 
I think from the very first we accepted the fact that we 
were to be nothing but friends." 

" And how did he take your engagement?" 

" Calmly enough. Don't fill your head with foolish fan- 
cies, Sydnie. It is a matter of indifference to Mr. Channing 
whom I marry." 

I thought there was a dash of bitterness in this. " It is 
of more importance to me," I said, warmly. " I cannot 
endure the thought that you are going to make yourself 
miserable. It would be better even now to break this en- 
gagement. There is nothing but a paltry feeling of grati- 
tude concerned in it. Love is shamed by such a mockery." 

" Hush, you wound me. Let me go my own way it is 
best for me. Come, we are staying up unconscionably," 
and shutting the piano almost violently, she drew me into 
the hall. 

I went to bed with a head full of vague ideas. It seemed 
to me that Anne ought not to be allowed to take such a 
desperate step. Were her parents blind ? 

I watched her and Mr. Channing narrowly the next day, 
and confess to a secret mortification in finding him polite 



 

and devoted in the most gentlemanly manner, but not in 
the slightest degree lover-like. Indeed he paid me the more 
exclusive attention. Anne was by far too generous to be 
suspected of anything like jealousy. 

It was singular, but in a week's time I accepted the 
fact, even if I could not be quite satisfied with it. I found, 
too, that Mr. Channing was no great favorite with Mr. 
Sutherland, while he did admire Mr. Otis warmly. Some- 
times the latter thawed a little when we were alone with 
him, but Mr. Channing's presence made him awkward and 
reserved. I was forced to admit that Mr. Otis possessed 
many fine characteristics, and a delicacy that one would 
hardly have expected. 

We were kept pretty busy. Shopping, ordering furniture for the new house, being subject to the nod of the 
dressmaker, and entertaining callers, occupied us incessantly. Anne seemed to enjoy the excitement, and I no 
longer attempted to dissuade her, or discourage her in any 
manner. But I had a fancy that if Mr. Otis had given less 
lavishly, and demanded more in return, claimed Anne as a 
right, and not taken little crumbs and odd moments of 
leisure, it would have been better for both. She was so 
rarely alone with him. Indeed she seemed to shrink from 
intimate personal contact, while she really had no aversion 
to him. 

Mr. Channing pleased me wonderfully. His beauty did 
not pall as one became accustomed to it. Every emotion 
brought a change to his features, a new light in his soft, 
deep eyes. His was a remarkably expressive face. Another 
charm was his reading. With his exquisite intonation this 
was drowsy, lulling music, that lingered in one's brain long 
after the sound had ceased. 

I wrote to Mrs. Lawrence about meeting him ; indeed 
he begged to send a message. What was my surprise to 



 

find a note from Mr. St. John enclosed in hers, a few 
words that angered me in an instant. Its contents were 
these : 

" Miss ADRIANCE : I regret extremely that you should 
have met Mr. Channing under such peculiar circumstances. 
"While he is agreeable to the verge of fascination, he is not 
a man I should select for intimate companionship. Be 
careful in your acquaintance with him. ST. JOHN." 

It was mean and cowardly thus to attempt to bias my 
opinion of Mr. Channing his own relative too! as if I 
were a child that had to be warned at every step, and he a 
person dangerous to any woman's peace. I smiled scorn- 
fully over the advice, resolving that it should not interfere 
with my enjoyment of his pleasant society in the slightest 
degree. Mr. Channing was not lacking in moral principles, 
or addicted to any small vices. Refined to the verge of 
fastidiousness, elegant in all his tastes without being fop- 
pish or sentimental, what was there to annoy or distress 
one? St. John was manifestly unjust and unreasonable. 

If he did not admire Mr. Changing, I must confess there 
was but little love lost between them. The latter was not 
bitter nor satirical, and yet he had a keen appreciation of 
the ridiculous, and a trick of drawing exaggerated pictures 
that was most amusing. One day he was enlarging upon 
Mr. St. John's habits of seclusion and distaste for society. 

"No one is quite good enough for his magnificence," he 
said. " I should think you two women would be a daily 
trial to him. Perhaps he takes you upon the Romish prin-
