our spoons. 

My new friend was a new variety; I saw that 
immediately. He was a younger man, very tall 
and slender, but not at a loss what to do with his 



 

length of limb; not in the least awkward; very 
well dressed; with an air of general acquaintance 
with everything in the world which it is very difficult to describe and impossible to explain. I do 
not mean that he was conceited; the knowledge 
was genuine ; how I came to see that he had it, I 
cannot tell, but I got the impression almost immediately. I think he was what the books call "a 
fine gentleman." I got the impression too that he 
was surveying me, and I have a small guess at the 
result of his survey. 

His first remark was that the afternoon was very 
warm. 

" Luckily for Mrs. Marshall," I said. 

" Why, if you please ? " 

" I fancy the scene would not be so pretty if people could not come out in their summer dresses." 

"You find it pretty, then?" 

"Very pretty." 

" You think ladies look better in summer than in 
winter?" 

"More like flowers," I answered, glancing at 
him; for I wondered if he thought me a niriny 

"More like flowers," he repeated. "I do not see 
any difference. I am always in a garden of roses 
when I see a collection of ladies." 

"Philadelphia must be a wonderful place then 
for beauty," I answered, not knowing how to interpret the glance with which he said this. 

" Don't you know it is ? " 

" I am a stranger here, and cannot tell." 



 

"Have you been to the river side?" 

"No." 

"Let us go." 

He gave me his arm and we strolled away, tak 
ing a direction that I had not followed before. 
The scene was indeed very pretty. As the sun 
got lower the lights were more picturesque and 
gay flitting figures in all the colours of the rain 
bow made a sort of kaleidoscope variety. 

" What do you think of garden parties ? " my com 
panioii began again. Now Caroline had told me 
not to say that I had never been to one before ; so 
I hesitated. He went on. 

"I hope Mrs. Marshall will give us a dance by 
and by. Do you like dancing?" 

" I have never tried it." 

" Never tried ! But you are going to try ? " 

"I think not." dear, this was worse than Mr. 
Stone. I thought of jEsop's fable, and wished for 
my King Log again. 

"What can have deprived so pleasant an amuse 
ment of the favour of one so fitted to enjoy it and 
make others enjoy?" 

" I suppose, Mr. Francis, it would not have your 
favour, if you could not acquit yourself in it to 
your satisfaction." 

"Is that the reason?" he asked laughing. 

" No, it is not the reason. I never go to balls." 

"Have you heard Tricarelli? " 

"No. I do not know who he is." 

"Not know Tricarelli? What a. pleasure before 


you! She is the famous new prima donna. Are 
you fond of music ? " 

" Some sorts," I said ; feeling vaguely that my 
sorts would not be his. 

" Well, you go to the opera ? " 

"No." 

" You will go ? " 

" I think not. I go to nothing of the kind." 

"Why not?" he inquired, looking down at me. 
" May my curiosity ask ? " 

"I am a country girl, Mr. Francis, and under 
stand none of your city ways." 

"I am sure you understand everything that is 
good," he said carelessly. And I ain sure you 
don t, went through my head. 

We were passing through an open grove of locust trees, where the ground was nicely kept, and 
winding paths invited one in every direction. The 
lights and shades under the trees were beautiful. 
By and by I saw water appearing between the 
branches and leaves, and then in a minute we 
came out upon the bank of the river. Seats were 
placed here too, as everywhere, but we were almost 
alone; the croquet ground and the refreshment 
pavilion had attracted all the world another way. 
Mr. Francis asked me if I would rest, and I sat 
down on one of the settees fronting the river. The 
lights from the clouds were reflected in the water 
the trees and banks shewed double; the soft rich 
colours, the fair sky, made a sweet picture. If I 
had but been alone! 



 

"This is a painter's colouring," said Mr. Francis. 
" Do you paint ? " 

"No." - -I was beginning to feel most miserably my 
ignorance of everything my companion knew, my 
ignorance of everything in the world; the intense 
contraction of my range of thought as compared with 
his. And yet, I had a world too, equally unknown 
to him ; but neither of us could talk to the other 
of what each knew. We had nothing in common. 

"This is also an evening to tempt a poet. Who's your favourite ? " 

" My favourite poet ? " 

" I was so bold as to ask that ? " 

"I have not read much. I believe Milton is my 
favourite." 

" Milton ! Paradise Lost ? " 

"Yes, that especially." 

"Do you mean," said he, sitting down now beside me, "that you believe in all that paraphernalia of devils and angels ? You, with so gentle a 
mouth, and such wise eyes ? " 

I thought my gentleman had no business to tell 
me about my mouth and eyes, and that he deserved 
a setting down; but I could not give it him. I 
did not know how. I defended myself with si 
lence, but everybody knows that is a very insufficient defence. 

" You don't believe in a personal devil, for in 
stance ? " Mr. Francis went on. I knew he was 
laughing at me in a polite way. I answered how 
ever,- - 



 

"Why not?" 

"Why not? Why because one should alwayp 
believe the best. Don't you think so? Who ever 
saw a devil? And you you have certainly had 
nothing to do but with the angels, ever since you 
drew the breath of this world." 

"Who ever saw an angel?" I returned coolly. 

At this moment a party came by, whom my 
companion started up to greet. These were people of his own sort. They understood one another ; 
the encounter was very lively, and the badinage 
on both sides very spirited; the ladies rallied him 
for not having sought them out, and he declared 
himself bound in flowery chains and a captive. I
think he thought the little country girl would not 
follow his meaning. They parted with an agree 
ment to meet presently in another quarter of the 
grounds. Mr. Francis sat down again. I felt very 
uncomfortable; sorry for him, and sorry for myself. I was a terribly stupid companion for him ; 
and he could not get rid of me! I meditated, how 
I could set him free. 

After a minute he asked me if I was rested ? if 
I would like to walk ? 

" I would rather be quiet here a little longer," 
i said. " But if you will go and join your friends, 
Mr. Francis, I can find my way quite well alone." 

" You are not dismissing me ? " he said. 

" Not at all ; only unbinding your chains." 

" Don't you know, that is sometimes the cruel 
lest unkindness you can do to a man ? " 



 

" Unbinding his chains ? " 

"Yes, when the chains are regarded as a distinction." 

" This is not one of those cases," said I, with 
laughter which I could not help. " I know the care 
of me is keeping you from your friends. Please 
do not let me keep you." 

" You do me the honour to speak of my friends. 
I will confess. I do not believe in friends, any 
more than I do in devils." 

" I am sorry for you." 

" It would be delightful to have you sorry for 
me." 

" I am quite serious, Mr Francis. I am not at 
all afraid to be left alone. Consider me a country 
girl, used to take care of herself; and go and rejoin 
your companions." 

" Leave you here alone ! " said he. " Heavens 
and earth ! what should I deserve. If you heard 
me mention chains a while ago, you heard me 
mention that they were chains of flowers ; not only 
distinction, but pleasure. I shall wear no others 
so willingly this evening." 

The light, careless, superior way in which this 
was said, and looked, was very unendurable to 
me. Not that the man was rude ; he was not rude ; 
but I could read him better than he knew. Ho 
thought I was a little country girl and could not 
read him; but I saw he was partly amused and 
wholly bored. I did not like precisely to furnish 
him stuff for either experience. 





" I beg you will leave me ! " I repeated. 

" That is impossible ; but Ah, here comes somebody. Good evening! Miss Burgoyne, since you 
dismiss me, may I give you into the charge of 
this gentleman, a friend of mine ? Mr. Iredell, 
let me present you to Miss Burgoyne. She expresses a wish to rest, and I am under the necessity of putting in an appearance elsewhere. I 
will trust you to see that she gets safe back to 
the house." 

He handed me over as easily as if I had been a 
parcel ; I do not know whether he would have been 
as careless about a parcel. He raised his hat and 
was gone ; and I looked anxiously at the stranger 
to see what sort of new protection I was to expect. 
However, the very first words reassured me, and I 
breathed freer. 

What a subtle difference there is in manner. In 
Borne things these two men were not unlike. They 
were both, I judge, about of an age ; they were both 
gentlemen, in one way; they both knew the world; 
they h A both travelled; neither of them, I should 
think, was a bad man ; both had great ease of manner. And yet, the ease of Mr. Francis set me on 
thorns; while the ease of Mr. Iredell seemed to put 
every annoying thing at an infinite distance from 
me. I had been like a bird with feathers all ruffled 
by fright or anger; and suddenly the ruffled plu 
mage was smooth, and I was as calm as if I had 
been in my own nest, instead of Mrs. Marshall's 
garden party. 



 

Mr. Iredell had understood that I wished to be 
quiet; so he made no move to go from the spot. 
He sat down and began to talk. Well, Mr. Francis 
had begun to talk, too, but we could not got on ; 
now it went as easily as oiled machinery. Of what 
did we not talk! Mr. Iredell told me about the 
Bavarian Alps, among which he had rambled; he 
described the scenery; he detailed the manners and 
habits of the people. From them we got naturally 
to the Dolomite mountains of the Rienz valley, (I 
don't in the least know where the Rienz valley is.) 
And I listened as if I were listening to a fairy tale, so 
wild and strange and unearthly the story sounded. 
Of the barren wilderness, the utterly dead world, 
the rocks cleft and riven into shafts and battlements and towers, only towers with no light to 
them; and of the stone pines which once green 
and glorious now stand upon the stone heaps and 
stretch their skeleton arms over the waste, bearing 
testimony of the life that once was and the death 
that reigns now in those solitudes. Mr. Iredell had 
seen them himself and could describe them well ; 
and he told me about the daring climbers that get 
to the top of those sheer dolomite pinnacles, and 
how they do it. I suppose he saw that I was interested, for he went on, from one thing to another. 
He had travelled much in Switzerland. I had read 
about Switzerland ; but it is quite another thing to 
look in the face of somebody who has been there 
and tells you with his own mouth what his own 
eyes have seen. He told me, moreover, things 



 

had never heard or read before; not only detaila 
of the scenery, but details of the people's life, and 
their character and manners and superstitions; especially in the German Alps. One story I recall 
particularly. It seems it is an article of their faith, 
that the great glaciers are a place of purgatory for 
the departed, where they are gradually purified not 
by fire but by frost. So many times they must be 
all frozen up, before the work is done and they can 
be released. 

"And they believe this?" I asked. 

"Not only believe it, but they think they can 
hear sometimes the sounds that come either from 
these weary souls or from the clinking of their ice- 
fringed garments. Don't you know what peculiar 
sounds are given out from large masses of ice in 
winter, even in our latitudes ? " 

"No. I do not think I do." 

" You have not been where you could hear them. 
But in the neighbourhood of one of those great 
glaciers the noises are exceedingly weird and startling, arising from the combined effects of frost 
and of the glacier's motion." 

" Then they move ? How can they ? " 

" They must They are forced onward and downward by the pressure of the upper portions, con 
stantly reinforced by new masses forming from the 
reservoirs of snow. They are just rivers of ice, 
making their way slowly down through the bed 
they have found for themselves, till they reach 
lower ground at a point where the melting just 



 

keeps pace with the amount of ice supplied by the 
daily motion or flow. Are you tired? Shall I tell 
you one of the people's purgatory legends?" 

"Pray do ! I should like to hear it very mncn." 

"It takes me back there again. Well Iliere 
was a young Swiss fellow once upon a time who 
was a devotee of the dance. Nothing in all the 
world he liked so well. Do you dance ? " 

"Mr. Francis was very much astonished al me, 
that I declared I did not." 

"Mr. Francis is a good dancer himself. How 
ever, he is not near loving it as my Swiss boy did. 
He danced whenever he could dance. He would 
give up anything else for an opportunity of dancing. Of course he was well known and much 
sought after to be a member of the company at all
