That was what I thought, Miss Attersol, and 
I thought, too " 

The girl was looking at him, surprised as 
February at a violet ; smiling, too, divinely 
pretty. " I wish I had said that ; it was 
what I felt and could not express." 

Cloden moved his hand as though in 
silent thanks to take hers and press it. But 
he refrained. The girl saw and understood. 
Her eyes met his, and encouraged perhaps 
by some light in them, he bent over and 
brushed the hand with his lips. Myrrha 
started, afraid of a kiss as of a bee. But her 
face colored, and she put a finger on a smile. 

"Forgive me," he murmured. 

The finger fell. 

"But may I not tell you what I thought?" 

To this, with a little movement of mouth 
and eyelids, a movement that was enchant- 
ing, perhaps enchanted, she assented. 





" I thought of the old legend which tells 
that long ago men and women were one, 
that later they separated, and it seemed to 
me if that were true they now must seek 
their earlier selves, and when they find each 
other it is love they find as well. That is 
what I thought, Miss Attersol, for I knew 
that all my life I had been seeking for 
you." 

The girl had made her face a blank, but 
in her throat was a tell-tale muscle. It 
spoke, and in speaking encouraged. 

" And I know, also," he continued, " if by 
any chance you might learn to think so too, 
that life would be fair as a dream." 

The sentence was so harmonious that he 
paused to note its effect. 

But still she said nothing. 

" Look at me," he implored. " Look at 
me, I love your eyes. Speak to me, I love 
your voice." 

He paused again. The girl raised her 
eyes. They were troubled yet eager, anxious and ardent. Lightly as sleep may fall 





he touched and took her hand. For a sec- 
ond it lay unresistant, then both tightened, 
and at once he approached nearer, the 
shoulders advanced a little, but slowly still, 
deliberately, inch by inch, his eyes fixed and 
probing her own. Then an arm went out 
and about her, and he drew the April of her 
lips to his. 

" Myrrha," he murmured, " my soul cries 
Gloria to you, and my heart answers In 
Excel sis." 

He had moved yet nearer, his eyes still in 
hers, her hand in his ; but the girl, emotion- 
alized and distraught, seemed struggling 
with herself. 

" Tell me," he whispered. " Tell me 
that you love. Tell me," he repeated. 
" Surely you must. Always I have hungered 
for you. You have been the odor of the 
feast at which I longed to sit, the shadow of 
the hope I dreamed to claim. At the time I 
did not know, but when I saw you I knew it 
was you I had been seeking ; I knew it, and 
I have found you at last. For I have, 





Myrrha, have I not ? Myrrha, tell me that 
I have. Speak to me, say you love." 

" You know it," she answered, but in that 
semi-breve a leaf uses when it whispers to 
the wind. 

" And may God bless you, then, for the 
gift to me." 

The girl disengaged her hand. The 
accompaniment was ceasing. "For tanf 
d'amor" the notes quawered and sobbed, 
died away in diminuendo, and with a final 
roulade Mrs. Smithwick rose from the 
piano. 

" There ! " she exclaimed. " I feel ten 
years younger." 

Cloden had risen, too. 

" May I, Mrs. Smithwick, with entire 
courtesy, inquire how old you are ? " 

" How old ? " And she laughed gayly. 
" How old ? You really want to know ? 
Well, there ; I am a hundred." 

" I never believe but half what a lady 
tells me," Cloden answered, with a smile as 
gay as her own. " But, if I ask, it is 





because I wished to assure you that in 
all your life you have never seen, never 
heard, never read, never imagined, never 
dreamed " 

" My, my ! What now ? " 

"Of a man a fraction as happy as I. 
Miss Attersol," and at this prelude the smile 
went from his face and a gravity, ceremonious, correct, came in its stead, " has just 
done me the honor to consent to be my 
wife." 

Mrs. Smithwick opened her mouth, closed 
it, opened it again, and stepped back, flab- 
bergasted, undone, speechless with bewilderment and joy. 

"Aunt, dear!" Myrrha exclaimed. "I 
didn't say " 

But the words dissolved the spell. Mrs. 
Smithwick flung herself at the girl, and em- 
braced her hysterically with raptures and 
tears. 

" My darling Myrrha ; you little cat, you 
little cat ! " 

" But, aunt " 





" You darling, darling child ! I knew it, 
I felt it. What am I to say?" 

" May I help ? " 

At her side Bancroft had abruptly surged. 
No one had heard him enter, and now the 
women turned, a trifle confused. 

But in the happiness of the moment Mrs. 
Smithwick forgot her dislike, and in little 
gulps she spluttered : 

" Myrrha is Lord Cloden, I mean. Oh, 
don't you understand ? They are they are 
engaged. " 

It was Bancroft's turn to step back. 

" Is it true, Myrrha ? " 

But the girl could have had no answer 
ready. She looked at him, then turned her 
head. 

" If it be true, Lord Cloden, I cannot 
very well congratulate you, for I had 
thought, God forgive me, that she was to 
be my wife." 

" Ah, indeed," murmured his lordship. 
" I can't very well express my regrets." 

The girl drew him to the window. 





" He did think so," she moaned. "What 
must he think of me now ? What must you 
think of me? What am I to do ? Girls 
don't go into nunneries any more, or I 
would. I would pass my life slaving for 
charity's sake. Tell me, what I am to do." 

In her perplexity she wrung her small 
hands, and she was at once so pretty and so 
miserable that the earl smiled. 

" You are an angel, Myrrha ; be satisfied 
with that. Don't try to be a saint ; it is a 
step backward." 



CHAPTER IV 

WHAT MAY BE READ IN THE PAPER 

AT the announcement of the engagement 
Bancroft had neither changed color nor 
fainted away, but the effect of the stab 
which Quain had dealt was but a vertigo in 
comparison. The love of his life had gone 
down in a trice ; he was as one who, falling 
asleep in Arcadia, awakes on the banks of 
the Styx. It was not alone that he loved, 
like many before and since he loved his 
love ; it was not only the girl, it was the 
hopes he had of her which made her to him 
what she was that little blue flower we call 
the ideal, for whose possession men balk the 
grave, barter life, and then marvel at its 
nothingness. It was that she was to him 
the goal of existence, beyond which happi- 
ness extends, and without which existence 
itself is idle. 





Men worthy of the name cannot eat three 
meals a day, however well served, with noth- 
ing but the morrow's repasts for a future. 
There is that in the human heart which 
makes aspirations and ambitions requisite to 
its pulsations ; there must be a chimera to 
pursue, even though we may suspect the 
chase to be futile, even though we have 
spelled from books of bronze that, quarried, 
the chimera massacres. 

A man who has no beliefs may be sin- 
cerely religious. Bancroft was, but his 
religion was the bella domia who had im- 
paradised his mind. It was for her he ate 
the three meals a day, went downtown, up- 
town, and read the morning papers. Devo- 
tion may be what we accept from others, 
yet it was what he gave to her, regretting 
only that it was not more to give, convulsed 
as by a spasm merely at thought of her lithe 
white arms. Nothing, no guerdon, no crown 
could equal the possibility of their embrace. 
And just when he seemed about to intercept 
the gleam of a coming day in which that 





sweetness might be his; at the moment when 
almost within his grasp glowed that flower 
for which for two years, ignored, rebuffed, 
subjugated yet never despairful, ceaselessly 
he had striven, it was as though he stood 
face to face with death to see it snatched 
from his hand by another. 

Cloden had declared himself the happiest 
man in the world. Bancroft said nothing, 
but he felt the most miserable. When he 
reached his room it was like entering a 
desert, and when he closed the door he 
wondered should he have the strength to 
leave it. 

Life is a song, but death is its refrain. 
And for a while the echo of that burden rip- 
pled harmoniously in his ears, as it has and 
will ripple in the ears of the strongest. The 
man who has never contemplated suicide 
has never loved ; and Bancroft loved so well 
that, at the first shock of the inevitable, 
suicide seemed the only solution, the one 
path to that peace which passes all under- 
standing. 





But to the soul that is sinking hope 
throws a straw. Mentally and physically 
his days had been far too actively employed 
to suffer him now more than a momentary 
contemplation of such a release. It went 
as it had come ; and at once, through the 
influence of that curious optimism which 
visits the condemned, one by one he began 
to review the chances of escape. So many 
presented themselves that when an hour 
had gone the man who sixty minutes before 
had been fumbling death was sound asleep. 
" Nos de"sespoirs sans fin," some one some- 
where has sagely said, " ne durent qu'un 
moment." 

But he slept with that wariness which 
dogs and lovers share, and he awoke, if 
not refreshed, at least alert. 

" I have seen that man before," he de- 
cided as he dressed. " But where ? " 

Then, mentally, he bolted at the eccen- 
tricity of his own thought. " I am daft," 
he told himself. But the thought remained, 
declining to be dismissed. 




Breakfast over he prowled about until an 
opportunity, which meanwhile he had deter- 
mined to seek, occurred. Myrrha went into 
the sitting-room ; he followed and locked 
the door. 

" Nobody can come in except through the 
window, and out of it any one who comes 
will go. Myrrha, I want ten minutes with 
you." 

Obedient, the girl sat down, her fingers 
intertwisted in her lap. But her face was 
very fair, the shadows had gone. The per- 
turbation of the night before had vanished. 
Dreams, tiara'd with coronets perhaps, may 
have reconciled her to fate. 

" Bien, monsieur, et puis ? " 

" Some time ago you asked me to be 
a brother, didn't you ? " 

The girl nodded, affirmatively, eagerly. 

" Very good. Your brother from this out 
I am. As a brother, I possess rights which 
I propose to exercise. In the first place you 
have got to listen, in the second to obey. 
Now tell me, what do you know of Cloden ; 





or rather, wait, let me tell you. You know 
nothing. Nothing," he repeated sewerely, 
" And, what is more, I will thank you not to 
attempt to interrupt. Myrrha, you should 
not have accepted him without consulting 
me. In view of the fact that you have, this 
engagement must remain in abeyance until 
I can learn, what neither of us know, whether 
he is, or is not, a man suited to be your 
husband." 

" I think, Arthur," the girl with silken 
sweetness lisped, " that of that I should be 
the only judge." 

" Why, of course you think so. All girls 
do. It would be extraordinary if they 
didn't. Yet it is just because they do have 
ideas of that kind that brothers were in- 
vented. Now, Myrrha, I don't mean to 
make phrases ; your happiness is dearer to 
me than anything else, and if you don't
