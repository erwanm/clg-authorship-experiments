“ They do get sifted and winnowed in four 
years. Yet even the seniors have not all the 
wisdom; the professors stand above them,” 
added Leslie, laughing. 

“ Oh, Helen ! Did you keep in touch with 
that lovely senior who was going to Paris to 
be married? ” 

“ Miss Bradshaw? Yes, I have had two 
letters from her, one just before she was mar- 
ried, and one much longer, written from Rome. 
She is very happy, and I am sure she deserves 
it.” 

“ She was a fine girl,” returned Leslie. 
“ And I think I rejoice in every woman who 
marries judiciously and happily.” 

“ Judiciously ! Oh ! Oh ! ” 

“ And why not? ” returned Leslie with a 
rising flush. “ I might have said wisely; that 
would not sound so heretical. But college 
training is supposed to give you a judicial 
mind. Do either of you recall Miss Wain- 
wright, who had one of the essays on crimi- 
nology, the prevention of it, I think, — I have 




almost forgotten already, which speaks well 
for a college memory.” 

“ Well, what of her? I thought she had a 
rather severe, judicial face. If she attained 
to judgeship, I shouldn't want to be the crimi- 
nal. But I dare say you heard she is married 
to a young clerk, who parts his hair in the 
middle and lisps a little.” 

“ No such thing, you flippant girl. She has 
entered a law office in New York and the 
classes at Columbia.” 

“ Well, — I do not want to be a lawyer or 
a doctor. And I am not fitted for the clerical 
state, unless I should be asked to adorn some 
delightful young parson and his rectory. I 
have no ambition to teach, so I think I shall 
be a flower of the field. I like that better than 
being a lily-of-the- valley.” 

“ The field is large and the flower has a 
mission,” Leslie Brooks returned, gravely. 
Then she glanced at Helen with eyes that were 
more eloquent than words. Helen reached 
over and took her hand. 

“ Don’t make me jealous! ” cried Lorraine 


 

with a laugh. “ Let us emerge from this 
shady way and view the sunset.'' 

It was gorgeous, indeed, and the air was 
full of resinous fragrance. Helen came across 
three belated daisies. They met groups of 
laughing girls enjoying the light-hearted pleas- 
antness of college days, since they had left 
the real responsibilities in the academic halls; 
freshmen, sophomores, juniors meeting on 
equal ground. Helen enjoyed the picture they 
made. One and another spoke to her or held 
out a hand. Miss Van Duyne walked beside 
her. 

“ We are so disappointed. We meant you 
should be class president. I like the sopho- 
more class wonderfully well, and I suppose I 
shall like the juniors still better. But when 
I get there you will have flown up to greater 
heights. We didn’t have a very nice time last 
year, did we? And you were so devoted to 
your chum. She didn’t come back. Don’t you 
think it foolish for girls to come just one 
year? ” 

“ She came because an aunt insisted upon 
sending her. And I think it was a good thing, 



It was gorgeous, indeed !  

too. She seems to have taken a higher stand- 
ing in her town, is to teach school for two 
years, and then be married.” 

“ Oh, then I do not wonder she did not 
want to return! I suppose she is very happy.” 

“ She was essentially a home girl, one of a 
family who were very dear to each other. I 
think she will have a satisfactory life, with 
a great deal of real delight in it.” 

“ I’m beginning to envy those two girls,” 
nodding to Leslie and Lorraine. “ Are you 
setting out to prove that three doesn’t spoil 
friendship? ” 

“ I do not think we have set out to prove 
anything. I liked them both last year, Miss 
Brooks was so kindly and considerate to the 
freshmen, and Miss Denman is simply charm- 
ing.” 

“ What do you suppose I told my mother ? 
I told her that I had set my heart upon one 
girl friend for next year. And now I am out 
of the running.” 

“ Why? ” Helen turned her bright, mirth- 
ful eyes upon her. 

“Oh, there are so many to care for you! 



Girl friendship is laughed about, yet my 
mother’s dearest friend was her mate at board- 
ing-school. She was mother's bridesmaid. 
She has four children ; we have five. One 
year mother visits her, the next summer Mrs. 
Colmer comes to us. We children all like her 
so much. It is a sort of ideal friendship. I'd 
like the same thing to happen to me.” 

“ Some writer says, friendship is a grand 
and august thing, and puts it on a higher 
plane than love. I think there is a good deal 
of it in the world.” 

“ I'd like a good deal of it to come my 
way.” 

How much had come her way, Helen 
thought, and wondered at it. Lorraine stood 
waiting for her. Miss Van Duyne took her 
hand from Helen's arm and went her way. 

“ They ought to have taken that girl for 
class president," Lorraine said. “ She has a 
style about her that carries weight. However, 
they have done very well, it is supposed. Isn’t 
it odd how soon the dark falls down? A 
moment ago the sky was resplendent in vividness. 




“ It’s turned a little cloudy. That gray 
mass has been drifting over from the east. 
I fancy we shall have rain to-morrow.” 

“ Oh, and the crowd was to go chestnut- 
ting!” 

“ There has been hardly frost enough yet.” 

“ Oh, you country girl ! I do believe you 
know the times and seasons for everything to 
grow and ripen. Oh, the supper smells good, 
doesn’t it? There is an aroma of warm gin- 
gerbread in the air. It will taste better than 
ten angel cakes.” 

“ I think you would be surfeited on the 
eighth,” returned Helen, laughingly. 

And surely it did rain the next day. Many 
of the more heroic went out for their consti- 
tutional, but others loitered in the various 
rooms planning, telling jokes, and chaffing one 
another. The social aspect was very fascina- 
ting to Helen; she had not taken in much of 
it last year. There were some merry girls in 
the juniors flinging quotations at each other 
and giving wrong authors. Miss Hendricks 
was prefacing her knowledgeable facts with, 
“ When I was at Leipsic,” or “ When we were 


 

going through the Escurial, at such a point 
was this splendid picture,’ which she could 
describe accurately. 

“ How much she must have travelled,” 
Helen said with a sigh of half-envy. 

Lorraine laughed. “ Why, she has never 
crossed the ocean.” 

“ Then it isn’t — ” true, Helen was about 
to say, but checked herself and stared at Lor- 
raine. 

“ The girls all know, but when they want 
some point elucidated — the picture in some 
church in Belgium, a statue at Florence, a bit 
about the Moors in Spain — they appeal to her 
at once. She is an insatiable -reader, and packs 
these things in her memory. I think it came 
about when old Professor Whiting was here 
at Commencement two years ago and she was 
a freshman. He was listening to a vivid de- 
scription of boating on the Thames, and said, 
‘ My dear young lady, how delightful it is to 
meet a spectator of such a scene.’ Of course 
she explained ; she is as truthful as most girls, 
and really doesn’t sail under false colors in 
ordinary things. But we all think this rather 




funny. I've seen her entertain a crowd of 
girls a whole evening.” 

“ Why doesn’t she write stories, if she has 
so much imagination? ” 

“ Oh, that’s the queer thing! People, espe- 
cially girls, are a curious conglomerate. She 
can’t write an exercise worth a pin, while she 
can do a fine translation. She declares the in- 
stant she puts pen to paper everything goes 
out of her head. Her Latin verses are terri- 
ble. She has a chum who takes down a talk 
in a kind of shorthand, and then she writes it 
over. She ought to keep a secretary, but I 
don’t know that it would be admissible.” 

“ She might make a good lecturer.” 

“ An admirable one. She really sees the 
things she reads, and she identifies herself with 
them.” 

“ It’s a curious gift, anyhow.” 

“ Oh, you must go to the Schubert this eve- 
ning! They want you to join. You ought to 
give your class the pleasure of your voice.” 

“ And the Shakespeare Club, the Early Eng- 
lish Club, the Emerson, and athletics and teas 
and plays. Where is the time for study?” 


 


“ And you are down for an article in the 
Miscellany for next month. Don't forget 
that.” 

Helen sighed. 

There was a sudden rush through the cor- 
ridor, and the door was pushed wider open. 
A bevy of girls, fairly tumbling over each 
other, stormed an entrance. 

“ We’ve just hit it!” exclaimed the fore- 
most girl, whose flaxen hair was always tum- 
bling about in a tendency to curl, and who 
would have been quite striking had her eye- 
brows and lashes been darker. “ And we want 
every junior to join. There were some pretty 
severe strictures on last year’s Hallowe'en, as 
you all know. It was carried to excess. It 
was disgraceful, fit only for a lot of rough 
boys! We’re going to change the aspect of 
the revel.” 

“ I am with you there. I shouldn't train in 
such horse-play again,” said Lorraine, rising. 
“ I’d ask you to sit down ” — and she glanced 
hesitatingly around. 

“ A cushion, or a corner, or even the middle 
of the floor,” interrupted some one. 





“ The spokesman must have that.” 

“ But it wasn't altogether Louise’s idea.” 

“ We all had a hand or a tongue in it. Like 
a snowball, it kept rolling through a field of 
bright thoughts — ” 

“ Mixed metaphor ! And you the club 
critic ! ” 

“ Hush ! Let me get the subject in 
hand.” 

“ I am waiting serenely,” said Lorraine. 

“ Well, it is this — ” 

“ Don’t claim it as your idea, now.” 

“ I’m not going to. Don’t worry. Worry 
is the destroyer of youth, the bane of age. It 
is to come from the whole class, if they will 
join and take an interest. The idea is to give 
the sophs and freshies a ball instead of an out- 
of-door tantarara, and to have it real rustic, 
with sunbonnets and checked aprons and half- 
a-century-old gowns, if there are such things, 
— if not, make them of furniture calico, — 
and. a country supper, pancakes, beans, roast 
pork, etc., etc.” 

“ Why, I think it will be just splendid!” 


 

declared Lorraine. “ Everybody will join, I 
am sure.” 

“ We want you to go with us to interview 
Miss Brooks and Miss Dana. Get them on 
our side, and we are all right. We can count 
on you, Miss Grant?” 

“ Oh, yes ! ” assented Helen with a bright 
smile. 

“ We have interviewed Miss Castle, and we 
can have the gymnasium. Dan will take down 
the apparatus and put it up again. Polly Mun- 
son will look after the eatables. Oh, we 
have it all down to a fine point, if we can get 
enough girls to chip in for expenses! ” 

“ But to feed such a crowd ! ” 

“ Oh, they will have had their dinners ! 
And it will be the fun, and not the feeding. 
Come, Miss Denman and Miss Grant.” 

Miss Holmes, next door, had out her card, 
“ Engaged,” but they knocked boldly. 

“ Yes, I’ll be glad to come if some one will 
help me through this trig afterward. It’s 
tougher than a hemlock knot.” 

“ I will,” assented Helen. 

“ I wanted to come and ask you, but I 




hadn't the courage. What a well-regulated 
brain you have, while mine is of the sieve 
order,’ and she squeezed Helen’s hand as they 
went to make the rounds. 


CHAPTER III 


THE FUN OF IT ALL 

It was really better that the time was lim- 
ited, and they adhered to the simplest plans. 
It was to be a truly country affair, rather 
backwoodsy. The gymnasium was trimmed 
with oak branches, interspersed with ever- 
green. Some one had unearthed great trails 
of “ bread and butter,” with its shining leaves 
hardly touched by frost. Paper flowers lent 
color and looked very natural, especially the 
great chrysanthemums.
