eleven o'clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely, dis- 
jointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tug- 
ging out a ragged word by the roots that had more hiccups 
than syllables in it. This, together with his hanging his coat 
on the floor on one side of a chair, and his vest on the floor 
on the other side, and piling his pants on the floor just in 
front of the same chair, and then contemplating the general 
result with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it "too 
many for him " and going to bed with his boots on, led us 
to fear that something 
he had eaten had not 
agreed with him. 

But we knew afterward that it was some- 
thing he had been 
drinking. It was the 
exclusively Mormon 
refresher," valley tan." 
Yalley tan (or, at least, 
one form of valley 
tan) is a kind of whis- 
ky, or first cousin to 
it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in Utah. 
Tradition says it is 
made of (imported) 
fire and brimstone. If 
I remember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed 
in the kingdom by Brigham Young, and no private drinking 
permitted among the faithful, except they confined themselves 
to " valley tan." 

Kext day we strolled about everywhere through the broad, 
straight, level streets, and eaijoyed the pleasant strangeness of 
a city of fifteen thousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible 
in it ; and no visible drunkards or noisy people ; a limpid 
stream rippling and dancing through every street in place of 
a filthy gutter ; block after block of trim dwellings, built of 
" frame " and sunbm'ned brick — a great thriving orchard and 
garden behind every one of them, apparently — branches from 
the street stream winding and sparkling among the garden 
beds and fruit trees — and a grand general air of neatness, repair, 
thrift and comfort, around and about and over the whole. 



And everywhere were workshops, factories, and all manner of 
industries; and intent faces and' busy hands were to be seen 
wherever one looked ; and in one's ears was the ceaseless clink 
of hammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of 
drums and fly-wheels. 

The armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dis- 
solute bears holding up the 
head of a dead and gone cask between them and makingthe pertinent remark, 
"TlNriED, "We Stand — (fioo — Divided, We Fall." It was 
always too figurative for the 
author of this book. But 
the Mormon crest was easy. 
And it was simple, unosten- 
tatious, and fitted like a 
glove. It was a representation of a Golden Beehive, 
with the bees all at work ! 
The city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the 
State of Connecticut, and 
crouches close down to the 
ground under a curving wall 
of mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the 
clouds, and whose shoulders bear rehcs of the snows of 
winter all the summer long. Seen from one of these dizzy 
heights, twelve or fifteen 
miles off, Great Salt Lake 
City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive 
of a child's toy-village re- 
posing under the majestic protection of the Chinese wall. 
On some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been 
raining every day for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in 
the city. And on hot days in late spring and early autumn 
the citizens could quit fanning and growling and go out and 
cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious snow-storm go- 
ing on in the mountains. They could enjoy it at a distance 
at those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their 
streets, or anywhere near them. 

Salt Lake City was healthy — an extremely healthy city. 
They declared there was only one physician in the place and 
he was arrested every week regularly and held to answer under 
the vagrant act for having " no visible means of support." 
They always give you a good substantial article of truth in 

Salt Lake, and good measure and good weight, too. Yery 
often, if you wished to weigh one of their airiest little com- 
monplace statements you would want the hay scales.] 

"We desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American 
" Dead Sea," the great Salt Lake — seventeen miles, horseback, 
from the city — for we had dreamed about it, and thought 
about it, aiid talked about it, and yearned to see it, all the first 
part of our trip ; but now when it was only arm's length away 
it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest. And so 
we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day — and that 
was the last we ever thought of it. We dined with some hos- 
pitable Gentiles ; and Wsited the foundation of the prodigious 
temple ; and talked long with that shrewd Connecticut Yankee, 
Heber C. Kimball (since deceased), a saint of high degree 

and a mighty man of commerce. 
We saw the " Tithing-House," and 
the "Lion House," and I do not 
know or remember how many 
more church and government 
buildings of various kinds and 
curious names. We flitted hither 
and thither and enjoyed every 
hour, and picked up a great deal 
of useful information and enter- 
taining nonsense, and went to 
bed at night satisfied. 
The second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street 
(since deceased) and put on white shirts and went and paid a 
state visit to the king. He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-man- 
nered, dignified, self-possessed old gentleman of fifty-five or 
sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that probably belonged 
there. He was very simply dressed and was just taking off a 
straw hat as we entered. He talked about Utah, and the In- 
dians, and Nevada, and general American matters and ques- 
tions, with our secretary and certain government officials who 
came with us. But he never paid any attention to me, not- 
withstanding I made several attempts to " draw him out " on 
federal politics and his high handed attitude toward Congress. 
I thought some of the things I said were rather fine. But he 
merely looked around at nic, at distant intervals, something as I 
have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten 
was meddling with her tail. By and by I subsided into an 
indignant silence, and so sat until the end, hot and flushed, 
and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage. But 
he was calm. His conversation with those gentlemen flowed 
on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer 
brook. When the audience was ended and we were retiring 
from the presence, he put his hand on my head, beamed down 
on me in an admiring way and said to my brother : 
" Ah — your child, I presume ? Bov, or girl ? " 


CHAPTER XIY. 

R. STREET was very bnsy with his telegraphic matters 
and considering that he had eight or nine hundred 
miles of nigged, snowy, uninhabited mountains, and waterless, 
treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire, it was 
natural and needful that he should be as busy as possible. He 
could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the road- 
side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across 
those exhausting deserts — and it was two days' journey from 
water to water, in one or two of them. Mr. Street's contract 
was a vast work, every way one looked at it ; and yet to com- 
prehend what the vague words " eight hundred miles of rug- 
ged mountains and dismal deserts" mean, one must go over 
the ground in person — pen and ink descriptions cannot convey 
the dreary reality to the reader. And after all, Mr. S.'s 
mightiest difficulty turned out to be one which he had never 
taken into the account at all. Unto Mormons he had sub-let 
the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking, and all 
of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make 
little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles 
overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when 
they took the notion, and drove home and went about their 
customary business ! They were under written contract to 
Mr. Street, but they did not care anything for that. They 
said they would " admire " to see a " Gentile " force a Mormon 
to fulfil a losing contract in Utah! And they made themselves 
very merry over the matter. Street said — for it was he 
that told us these things : 

" I was in dismay. I was under heavy bonds to complete 
my contract in a given time, and this disaster looked very 
much like ruin. It was an astomiding thing ; it was such a 
wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I was entirely nonplussed. 
I am a business man — have always been a business man — do 
not know anything hut business — and so you can imagine how 
like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country 
where written contracts were woi'thless ! — that main security, 
that sheet-anchor, that absolute necessity, of business. My 
confidence left me. There was no use in making new con- 
tracts — that was plain. I talked with first one prominent 
citizen and then another. They all sympathized with me, first 
rate, but they did not know how to help me. But at last a 
Gentile said, ' Go to Brigham Young ! — these small fry cannot 
do you any good.' I did not think much of the idea, for if 
the law could not help me, what could an individual do who 
had not even anything to do with either making the laws or 
executing them? He might be a very good patriarch of a 
church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something sterner 
than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hun- 
dred refractory, hali-civilized sub-contractors. But what was 
a man to do ? I thought if Mr. Young could not do anything 
else, he might probably be able to give me some advice and a 
valuable hint cr two, and so I went straight to him and laid 
the whole case before him. He said very little, but he showed 
strong interest all the way through. He examined all the 
papers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a 
hitch, either in the papers or my statement, he would go back 
and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to an intel- 
ligent and satisfactory result. Then he made a list of the 
contractors' names. Finally he said : 

" ' Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain. These contracts 
are strictly and legally drawn, and are duly signed and certi- 
fied. These men manifestly entered into them with their eyes 
open. I see no fault or flaw anywhere.' 

" Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other 
end of the room and said : ' Take this list of names to So-and- 
so, and tell him to have these men here at such-and-such an 
hour.' 

" They were there, to the minute. So was I. Mr. Yoimg 
asked them a number of questions, and their answers made 
my statement good. Then he said to them : 

" ' You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations 
of your own free will and accord ? ' 

" ' Yes.' 

" ' Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you 

! Go!' 


" And they did go, too ! They are strung across the des- 
erts now, working like bees. And I never hear a word out 
of them. There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other 
officials here, shipped from Washington, and they maintain 
the semblance of a republican form of government — but the 
petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute monarchy and Brig- 
ham Young is king ! " 

Mr, Street was a fine man, and I believe his story. I 
knew him well during several years afterward in San Fran- 
cisco. 

Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, 
and therefore we had no time to make the customary inquisition
into the workings of polygamy and get up the usual 
statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the attention 
of the nation at large once more to the matter. I had the 
will to do it. With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I was 
feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform 
here — until I saw the Mormon women. Then I was touched. 
My heart was wiser than my head. It warmed toward these 
poor, ungainly and pathetically " liomely " creatures, and as I 
turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I said, 
" No — the man that marries one of them has done an act of 
Christian charity which entitles him to the kindly applause 
of mankind, not their harsh censure — and the man that mar- 
ries sixty of them has done a deed of open-handed generosity 
so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered in his 
presence and worship in silence." For a brief sketch of Mormon history', 
and the noted Mountain Meadow 
massacre, see Appendices A and B. 




CHAPTER XT. 

IT is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about 
assassinations of intractable Gentiles. I cannot easily 
conceive of anything more cosy tlian the night in Salt Lake 
which we spent in a Gentile clen, smoking pipes and listening 
to tales of how Burton galloped in among the jleading and 
defenceless "Morisites" and shot them down, men and 
women, like so many dogs. And how Bill Hickman, a De- 
stroying Angel, shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit 
against him for a debt. And how Porter Rockwell did this 
and that dreadful thing. And how heedless people often come 
to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or polygamy, or 
some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at day- 
light such parties are sure to be found lying up some back 
alley, contentedly waiting for the hearse. 

And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to 
these Gentiles talk about polygamy ; and how some portly 
old frog of an elder, or a bishop, marries a girl — likes her, 
marries her sister — likes her, marries another sister — likes her, 
takes another — likes her, marries her mother — likes her, mar- 
ries her father, grandiather, great grandfather, and then comes 
back hungry and asks for more. And how the pert young 
thing of eleven will chance to be the fivorite wife and her 
own venerable grandmother have to rank away down toward 
D 4 in their mutual husband's esteem, and have to sleep in 
the kitchen, as like as not. And how this dreadful sort of 
thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother and 
daughters, and the making a young daugliter superior to hei 
own mother in rank and authority, are things which Mormon 
women submit to because their religion teaches them that 

the more wives a man has on earth, and the more children he 
rears, the higher the place they will all have in the world to 
come — and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to 
say anything about that. 



According to these Gentile friends of ours Brigham Young's 
harem contains twenty or thirty wives. They said 
that some of them had grown old and gone out of active ser- 
vice, but were comfortably housed and cared for in the henery 
— or the Lion House, as it is strangely named. Along with 
each wife were her children — fifty altogether. The house was 
perfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still. 
They all took their meals in one room, and a happy and home- 
like sight it was pronounced to be. Kone of our party got an 
opportunity to take dinner with Mr. Young, but a Gentile by 
the name of Johnson professed to have enjoyed a sociable 
breakfast in the Lion House. He gave a preposterous account 
of the " calling of the roll," and other preliminaries, and th& 
carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in. But 
he embellished rather too much. He said that Mr. Youngr- 
told him several smart sayings of certain of his "two-year- 
olds," observing with some pride that for many years he had 
been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of the East- 
ern magazines ; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one 
of the pets that had said the last good thing, but he could not 
find the child. He searched the faces of the children in de- 
tail, but could not decide which one it was. Finally he ave 
it up with a sigh and said : 

" I thought I would know the little cub again but I 
don't." Mr. Johnson said further, that Mr. Young observed 
that life was a sad, sad tiling — " because the joy of every new 
marriage a man contracted was so apt to be blighted by the in- 
opportune funeral of a less recent bride." And Mr. Johnson 
said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing 
in private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a 
breast-pin, remarking that she had found out that he had been 
giving a breast-pin to 'No. 6, and she, for one, did not propose 
to let this partiality go on without making a satisfactory 
amount of trouble about it. Mr. Young reminded her that 
there was a stranger present. Mrs. Young said that if the 
state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the 
stranger, he could hud room outside. Mr. Young promised the 
breast-pin, and she went away. But in a minute or two 
another Mrs. Young came in and demanded a breast-pin. Mr. 
Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young cut him short. 
She said ISTo. 6 had got one, and Iso. 11 was promised one, 
and it was " no use for him to try to imjjose on her — she hoped 
she knew her rights." He gave his promise, and she went. 
And presently three Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened 
on their husband a tempest of tears, abuse, and entreaty. 
They had heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and No. 14. Three 
more breast-pins were promised. They were hardly gone 
when nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a 
new tempest burst forth and raged round about the prophet 
and his guest. Nine breast-pins were promised, and the 
weird sisters filed out again. And in came eleven more, 
weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth. Eleven prom- 
ised breast-pins purchased peace once more. 

" That is a specimen," said Mr. Young. " You see how it 
is. You see what a life I lead. A man canH be wise all the 
time. In a heedless moment I gave my darling No. G — excuse 
my calling her thus, as her other luime has escaped me for the 
moment — a breast-pin. It was only worth twenty-five dollars 
— that is, ajyparently that was its whole cost — but its ultimate 
cost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more. You your- 
self have seen it climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars — 
and alas, even that is not the end ! For I have wives all over 
this Territory of Utah. I have dozens of wives whose num- 
bers, even, I do not know without looking in the family Bible. 
They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and 
valleys of my realm. And mark you, every solitary one of 
them will hear of this wretched breast pin, and every last one 
of them will have one or die. No. 6's breast pin will cost 
rae twenty-five hundred dollars before I see the end of it. 
And these creatures will compare these pins together, and if 
one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be thrown on 
my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in 
the family. Sir, you probably did not know it, but all the 
time you were present with my children your every movement 
was watched by vigilant servitors of mine. If you had 
offered to give a child a dime, or a stick of candy, or any trifle 
of the kind, you would have been snatched out of the house 
instantly, provided it could be done before your gift left your 
hand. Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to 
m.ake an exactly similar gift to all my children — and knowing 
by experience the importance of the thing, I would have stood 
by and seen to it myself that you did it, and did it thoroughly. 
Once a gentleman gave one of my children a tin whistle — a 
veritable invention of Satan, sir, and one which I have an un- 
speakable horror of, and so would you if you had eighty or 
ninety children in your house. But the deed was done — the 
man escaped. I knew what the result was going to be, and I 
thirsted for vengeance. I ordered out a flock of Destroying 
Angels, and they hunted the man far into the fastnesses of the 
Nevada mountainSi -.But they never caught him. I am not 
cruel, sir — I am not vindictive except when sorely outraged — 
but if I had eaught him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I 
would have Itifejttim i;il;o *bfi nuery till the brats whistled 
him to death. By the slaugfrEered body of St. Parley Pratt
