strange mood which now consumed the Eabbi. 

What store of strength did he need for the next 
act in the tragic drama whose scenery had now 
begun to shift with darkening swiftness ? 



270 THE STORY OF JESUS CHEIST 

Had his unseen Father, in whom he believed so 
profoundly, taken this desolate son to his heart in 
the splendors of a mystical hour ? Did it need the 
night on Lebanon to fortify Jesus for the days which 
were to come ? 

He told no person. But he came down the moun- 
tain a changed and determined man. No more un- 
certainty, whether apparent or real, troubled his 
purpose or controlled his movements. From that 
hour, he turned without one hesitating motion to 
meet his doom. It has been said of him in a few 
strong words which discourage a weaker version of 
the crisis : " From that time he set his face stead- 
fastly towards Jerusalem.'* 

The history of martyrdom has its grandeurs, its 
follies, and its delusions, like that of all other human 
enthusiasms ; and, in its awful processes, minor men 
have exhibited great qualities. Thousands of them 
have studied, in passionate desire to repeat it, the 
bearing of Jesus of Nazareth. But when has it been 
reduplicated ? Who has trodden such a road as he 
with such a step ? It was so human, so sensitive ; 
it winced so from anguish; it indicated at every 
blood-drop suffering so acute that ordinary sym- 
pathy has not the nerve to follow it; it was the 
footfall of flesh on fire; yet it trod like metal on 
stone. 

Bravely to accept the inevitable calls forth a kind 
of self-respect which often honors human character, 
and takes the form of fortitude or courage- Jesus 
elected the avoidable ; forced it, hastened it, and 
faced it as if te had been king, not captive of his 



THE MOUNTAIN: AISTD THE TOMB 271 

fate. He moulded his own sufferings with the seren- 
ity of a sculptor modeling the statue of a god. 

The Nazarene now set forth upon the itinerary of 
his last journey through Palestine, moving from pro- 
vince to province as occasion dictated, facing or flee- 
ing immediate danger, as the large plan of his sacri- 
fice seemed to him to require. His dearest friend 
never saw him falter. Relentless, determined, 
seeing it all the while, he trod into the trap which 
church and state had laid for him in the capital. 

Who, in the preconsciousness of a terrible fate, 
lives as if it were not to be ? Which of us, knowing 
that he is to die, can act as if he were to live ? Jesus 
went straight on with common life. Daily duty pre- 
sented to him, as it always had, the foremost claims. 
He preached, he taught, he prayed; he healed, he 
rebuked, he forgave, he comforted. He gave his 
last six months of life to everything but his own in- 
terests, to every being except himself. His patients 
thronged his path early and late, as they had always 
done. Sickness and sorrow accumulated in his way, 
leaning upon him more heavily than ever. The woe 
of the world clung to him more helplessly, more per- 
sistently, as if it were a sentient thing, and had a 
dim foreknowledge that its opportunity was short. 

His own spiritual force responded visibly to the 
calls upon it in these intense months. He preached 
with an ecstatic absorption. His mental powers 
grew at once more profound and more simple. His 
discourses at this period were many, and remain 
matchless. When has the intellect of Jesus Christ 
received anything like its recognition? We have 



272 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

been accustomed to think of him so exclusively as a 
great religious influence that the supreme quality 
of his mind has escaped us. 

Very many of his immortal thoughts, dating from 
this crisis, were apparently aud deliberately thrown 
away in private instruction. His acquired lack of 
confidence in mobs gave him reserved opinions about 
the uses of public address. He began to question its 
permanent value. He became deeply conscious that 
he must now seek permanence rather than immediate 
effect for the truth which was about to cost him his 
life. He began to trust his thought more and more 
to his personal friends. 

Type and the press did not exist. He had none 
of the conditions of the modern reformer. 

Yet the Nazarene forecast the methods of influ- 
ence which would be in power centuries afterwards. 
The most eminent orator of history, he preferred the 
medium of a few intelligent and controlling minds. 
He confided his system of faith to twelve unlettered 
men. Did he know that these would become the 
editors and authors of the greatest publication in 
the world ? 

There was a suburb of Jerusalem which he came 
to love and to seek, a convenient and pleasant retreat 
(scarcely two miles away) for a traveler wearied of 
the town, or for personal reasons unsafe within it. 
In the course of a few brief visits to the capital, 
troubled, hurried stays that sent him forth from the 
city sadder than he came, the heretic preacher, 
in these last dark months, had opportunities to culti- 
vate his warm friendship for one family resident in 



THE MOUNTAIN: AISD THE TOMB 273 

Bethany. This was the preferred household of three 
which came nearest of any that he had known since 
boyhood to giving him a sense of home. 

No closer ties than those between brother and 
sister deviated the attachment of Lazarus and Mary, 
who were unwedded, and of Martha, a widow, from 
their gentle guest. The four made a circle of those 
solitaries whose shared, yet separate lives, form the 
best material for friendship. A beautiful devotion, 
deferent from the hosts, faithful on the part of the 
guest, grew into delicate intimacy. 

Martha, proprietor of the home, a wealthy house- 
holder, a little fussy and arbitrary, as good house- 
keepers are ; Mary, the devotee, a little neglectful 
and absent-minded, as dreamers are ; and Lazarus, 
the younger brother of the family, made an interest- 
ing group. Their affection became peculiarly dear 
to Jesus. His wasting heart threw tendrils around 
them. Their open home was precious to the lonely 
man. 

It is pleasant to think that, at this troubled time 
of his life, he knew something of a home of real ease. 
He had been so poor, so hunted ; he had so much of 
privation, and so little of comfort ! The hospitality 
of the poor and of the middle classes, spasmodically 
offered, gratefully accepted, had been his usual lot. 
He had met it cheerfully ; but his sense of homeless- 
ness was pitifully acute. 

He once wistfully compared his condition to that 
of the wild creatures of the forests and the skies. 
The foxes and the birds had their holes and their 
nests. The Son of Man, he said, had not where to 



274 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

lay Ms head. These plaintive words constitute one 
of the rare complaints of his hard life. 

His experience since the evening on the mountain 
had been more than at some other times a desolate 
one. At the very outset of his first journey to Jeru- 
salem (traveling by way of Samaria), he had been 
refused outright admission to a village where, being 
tired out, he had arranged to spend the night. This 
breach of the commonest laws of Oriental hospitality 
was so incredible that the indignation of the twelve 
knew no restraint. They demanded, in a rage, that 
the Rabbi should smite the offending town with the 
wrath of heaven, clearly believing that he could do 
it if he would. Gently rebuking them, the wearied 
man patiently took his march again and humbly 
walked on to another village. He showed no resent- 
ment. 

Worse than this had happened in Judea. To one 
of his public addresses at Jerusalem befell an omi- 
nous interruption. Something, hurled by an unseen 
hand, struck him violently. It proved to be a stone. 
Smarting with the pain of a severe blow, quivering 
with the nervous shock, the preacher paused and 
steadfastly regarded the crowd. He perceived clear 
signs of an intention to mob him by stoning him to 
death. 

He changed color. His fine lips parted. What 
just denunciation would they roll forth ? What aw- 
ful retort? Earthquake, fire, flood, sunstroke, the 
blows of the winds, or the resources of sudden death 
which lurk in the human body were these at his 
disposal ? Which would he select from the invisi- 



THE MOUNTAIN: AM) THE TOMB 275 

ble ranis of his mystical guardsmen to protect him- 
self ? to punish his assailant ? 

He chose the sting of a gentle word. " Many 
kindnesses have I done you. . . . For which of them 
do ye stone me ? " 

Heartsick and hopesick, he had been lovingly re- 
ceived into Martha's luxurious home. He had sat 
with Mary under the tents of green branches erected 
in the court, or near the house, on Festival Week, 
and rested in the flickering of cool shadows, talking 
quietly of the great thoughts with which his mind was 
throbbing, while the mistress of the house bustled 
to and fro ordering his upper room, or preparing 
for many guests. Of these he was the most distin- 
guished. He was treated accordingly. The social 
position of Lazarus and the ladies of the family was 
so prominent that their unconcealed devotion to the 
Nazarene made them no special trouble in ecclesi- 
astical quarters ; they were, for whatever reason, 
let alone in their heresy. At all events, they never 
wavered from it. They became and remained his 
fast and affectionate friends. Every comfort that 
wealth and love could command their hospitality 
crowded upon him. The worn-out man, accustomed 
to a rude and simple lot, gratefully drew one long, 
sighing breath in the soft air of gentle surroundings. 
His exquisite delicacy of nature rested in it, like a 
bruised nerve, long lacerated and neglected. Far 
beyond common woe or want as his personal emer- 
gency had gone, all human distinctions looked 
smaller than ever . to him ; and he had never rated 



276 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

them as of much consequence. But the educated 
sympathy of refinement he did not, for he could not, 
undervalue. He needed it too much just then. It 
came at the right time. Friendship, at its best and 
sanest, he tasted with a touching gratitude ; the ripe 
and beautiful fruit he laid gently down when the 
hour came ; no one heard him complain because he 
must relinquish it. 

It was in Perea, and the travelers were moving 
with caution. He had found himself in such immi- 
nent peril in Judea that he had kept out of the pro- 
vince for a time, teaching 9 healing, and preaching 
as usual wherever he went. He was about a day's 
journey from Bethany. A sudden message reached 
him from his friends there : 

" He whom thou lovest is sick. Lord, hasten to 
him!" 

But Jesus did not hasten to Lazarus. The inex- 
plicable mood which he had more than once shown 
in emergencies took possession of him. With ap- 
parent disregard of the appeal, he went on about his 
work where and as he was. Two days passed. 
Strange silence came upon him. He would not talk 
about the thing. 

Two days ! A man might die and be buried in 
the East in that time. And this his chosen friend, 
of whose lavish hospitality he had freely partaken ; 
this the household where, above all others in Judea, 
he loved and was loved ! It began to be rumored 
that the healer was afraid to go to Bethany ; that 
he would let his friend die, like any timid, com-

mon man, rather than risk his life so near Jerusa- 
lem. His disciples interrogated him persistently* 
But the most that they gained was this enigmatic 
explanation of his conduct : " It is that you might 
believe." 

The sick man was asleep, he said. " When I go, 
I will awaken him." Then the twelve remembered 
the little maid, the child of Jairus, and how the 
Rabbi spoke about her, affirming that she was not 
dead. " If he sleep, he shall do well," they answered 
cheerfully, for they were much relieved, being anx- 
ious about their master's reputation in this matter. 
But Jesus turned upon them one of his long and 
silent looks." 

" I tell you plainly," he said with decision, " Laz- 
arus is dead." 

Suddenly, at the end of two days, he gave the 
order to start for Bethany. And now the fishermen 
took fright themselves. They begged him. for his 
life's sake and for theirs to keep away from the re- 
gion of the capital. They reminded him of the stone 
which struck him on that startling day. They re- 
minded him that if !Lazarus were dead there was 
nothing to be done. 

But he looked at them and strode on. His staff 
scattered the dust far ahead of his party. It was 
almost impossible now to keep up with him. His 
unaccountable indifference and delay had warmed 
into what seemed an unreasonable anxiety and hurry. 
The talith that he wore that day was white, and 
his tall figure looked like a pillar of light, as he 
moved rapidly forward, ia advance of his disciples, 



278 THE STORY OF JESUS CHEIST 

who plodded after, rough and faithful, obedient and 
perplexed, perplexed as they always were. They 
spent their lives in an intellectual strain. A man's 
faith is worth something when it burns through such 
mental conditions as theirs. 

They overtook him before they came to their 
journey's end ; and the group entered Bethany to- 
gether. 

The first news which reached them was as bad as 
it could be. It was, indeed, as the Eabbi had said. 
Lazarus was dead. More than that, he was dead 
and buried. 

Lazarus was the most prominent citizen in Beth- 
any, and the circumstances of his death were on 
everybody's tongue. The village was astir with 
mourners. Neighbors gossiped about the dead man's 
tarrying friend, not kindly. Muttered reproaches, 
displeased and distressed faces, met the healer every- 
where. Before he had set foot within the borders 
of the village, he felt himself to be the most unpop- 
ular man in it. He looked a little surprised at this. 
He had grown more and more restless during the lat- 
ter part of the journey ; he had eaten little and with 
difficulty ; he would take no rest at noon, but hur- 
ried along ; his nervous system seemed to be on an 
unusual tension; his expression was less serene, 
more intent, and now it began to indicate sudden 
pain. He panted slightly, as if he had received an 
unexpected blow upon the face which affected his 
breathing. He had stopped so strong was the 
popular feeling with his group of friends about 



THE MOUNTAIN: AND THE TOMB 279 

him, and made no movement to advance into the 
village. 

A grumbling by-stander viciously observed that 
the Nazarene was not in a hurry to enter the house 
where he had been so well treated, and whose be- 
reavement he could have prevented if he had taken 
the trouble ; for there seemed to be no doubt but 
that he was a very distinguished healer. 

Jesus entered into conversation with no one, but 
stood silently, looked so troubled that his disciples 
felt discouraged. "What did it all mean ? How 
would he defend himself when people called him a 
craven or a faithless friend? Why had he let it 
happen as he had ? Why ? Why ? Why ? 

The old, unanswered question faltered to their 
lips, and worried their hearts. Their minds found 
no reply to it. 

At last one of them plucked his robe, and whis- 
pered to him that Martha was coming. Jesus raised 
his eyes, it seemed reluctantly, to meet hers. He 
was prepared for any reproaches. 

But, upon the first glance at her, his whole expres- 
sion changed. Hers was subdued, affectionate. The 
voluble housewife, touched by grief, had acquired 
a dignity and a gentleness which made another
