vise Mrs. Marshall for her best interests, all the same. 
Half a million was too much money to throw away. He 
would make one more effort. 

"Mrs. Marshall," he began, "there is another point I 
think you ought to consider. I should not feel that I had 
dealt fairly with you unless I mentioned it. In any suit 
for divorce, though I say frankly I have no idea such a step 
is contemplated, Mr. Marshall would have an important 
point in the fact that you did go away. Can I not per- 
suade you to consider your own interest and be a little 
conciliatory?" 

For all answer she waved her white, firm hand. Mr. 
Aldenshaw noted how very handsome it was, and that she 
was a regal kind of woman. Any man might be proud of 
her. It was a thousand pities they could not agree, for in 
his secret soul he did not believe Thomas Marshall was 
destined for a long life. However, talking reason to an 
unreasonable woman was like whistling down the wind. 

Celia sat at her easel in the back room. She started 
when her mother appeared, so like some phantom of un- 
utterable woe. 

" He wants my boy, Celia," she cried in that intensely 
tremulous voice which showed how highly wrought every 
pulse had been. " He wants my boy, my little Bertie! 
To think that nearly always since he has been born I have 
cared for him, earned his bread, a thing mothers seldom 
have to do. And now, when a little luck, as he used to call 
it, has befallen him, he will provide for the child, ruin him 
with every luxury, for Bertie could be easily ruined, soul 
and body. Oh, is that all of & father's love, to do when it 
is no trouble, no exertion ? Celia, do you remember that 



i 





horrible night when he fed him the whiskey? Oh, I can- 
not, cannot give him up ! " 

There was a long shuddering sigh, and she reeled as if 
some one had struck her a blow. Celia sprang toward her 
and softened the fall it was too late to prevent, and laid 
the senseless form tenderly on the carpet while she shrieked 
for help. She had never seen her mother faint before, and 
thought she must be dead, but presently a dull crimson 
flushed the marble face, there was a quiver in the eyelids, 
a tremor ran through the body, and life returned. 

"What was the matter?" asked Daisy in alarm. 

" Hush," — and Celia's voice was scarcely less awesome 
than the sculptured features in their deathlike repose. 
" Some one came — I do not know. She must go to bed 
for awhile." 

They helped her to her chamber and she sank unresist- 
ingly upon the bed. 

" Mamma, mamma," cried Celia softly, " I shall never go 
away, never leave you." 



CHAPTER XIX. 

"But it behoves ns, indeed, to reflect in the first place that we are by 
nature women, and not able to contend against men." — Sophocles. 

Thomas Mabshall was positively angered at the refu- 
sal, though, to do Mr. Aldenshaw justice, he used his best 
efforts to promote mutual concessions. Tom was irritable 
from many causes. Ill health, and a horrible fear that it 
might prove a more serious matter than Dr. Breintnall 
seemed to think. No one knew the intense, overwhelm- 
ing shrinking from death that pervaded him. When his 
brain was steeped and dulled with the enervating, sottish 
effects of liquor, he could have met death with the cool- 
ness of utter indifference, so often mistaken for heroism. 
" He died game," we hear of some miserable soul, in which 
all but mere brutal instincts have been quenched ; but it 
is the game of the shambles, not the intrepidity of the pit, 
that fights for victory, as well as life. 

His mother and sister exerted an unwholesome influ- 
ence over him. Loving, tender, and sympathetic, his 
mother certainly was, but her ideas of right had been 
trained by society usages rather than on any firm prin- 
ciple, any sense of justice to her neighbor. # She forgave 
Tom so easily now, when he was prosperous and his phy- 
sical state appealed to her ready pity. If Eleanor only 
had done this or that ; and Tom had not enough manli- 
ness to exclaim that she had tried to do it hundreds of 
times, and he had frustrated all her efforts. Mrs. Van- 
duyne, with the narrow grudge of some women, felt that 
Eleanor was being paid back for her unwarranted step. 
She had taken all the blessings of Tom's early prosperity ; 


she had utterly refused to share her success in life with 
him, — had she been so ready to shower hers upon her 
brother in his evil times ? — and now, when the tide had 
turned, it seemed a kind of poetical judgment that she 
should be shut out of it. One of the other sisters came 
in town, and added her voice to the general verdict. 

" Of course it is right for Tom to have the boy," said 
Mrs. Brooke decisively, " His mother would have to put 
him to a trade, while he ought to be educated for some 
profession, and then women cannot manage boys. They 
grow out of petticoat government. They either make 
molly-coddles or incipient rowdies. There is no knowing 
what habits he may contract in that station in life, and he 
does need to be put in his proper position, -^ that of a 
rich man's son." 

All this had a subtile effect upon the half-sick man, and 
warped his better inclinations. He never asked himself 
what it would have been had he come home ill and penni- 
less. It was his misfortune that his mind had never been 
broad enough to take in both sides of a question, though 
he could take in two aspects of it, but they would both 
have points of agreement. In his miserable days the pity 
had been for himself, for his hard luck. "Now everyone 
paid him a curious deference. A man with nearly a mil- 
lion, at least a secure half million, while the other was 
contingent, was certainly a person worthy of respect, and 
it did not do to inquire too closely into his past. He had 
not been quite steady at one time — it had been lopped 
off to that already, — but no word had ever been uttered 
against his moral character. In his business misfortunes, 
all his debts had been honorably paid. He was no robber, 
forger, defaulter, or swindler, and he had been a jolly, 
good fellow. His wife, — well, no one knew just the cir- 
cumstances of the separation, but both families had 
strongly disapproved, so the verdict went against Eleanor. 

There was another point in which Tom Marshall ac- 



 

quired a certain respect. He grew wonderfully fastidious, 
as illness sometimes brings out long-disused qualities. 
He dropped the vernacular of the bar-room and the mines, 
and began to despise it. He corrected his errors of pro- 
nunciation and elision; he had his old training to fall 
back upon. He was as much of a gentleman as the best. 
He used the finest and most delicate clothing, the richest 
personal appointments. In his early days he had never 
stinted upon these matters. 

So it seemed to him that Eleanor was the only one who 
refused him any meed of praise for his reform or his 
money. He had never said to himself that the separation 
was final, and felt strongly virtuous and heroic in this 
resolve, for some men would have gained their freedom, 
and begun an entirely new life. He just temporized with 
himself, an infinitely more dangerous process. But he 
learned that he could gain complete control of his son, 
and he instructed Mr. Aldenshaw to push matters. He 
wanted to go away, and the case must be decided. 

Eleanor Marshall rose from her bed of pain and anguish 
and girded herself to meet a struggle she knew was immi- 
nent, for she still was able to judge her husband correctly. 
Come what would, she would not give up her son. 

Celia, meanwhile, wrote a little note to Mrs. Howarth, 
giving her mother's illness as an excuse for her remaining 
at home, and also to her kind friend Mrs. Linthorpe. 
What she should say to Fairfax Sherrard was a subject 
of much painful consideration. With the natural deli- 
cacy of a finely attuned soul, she shrank from committing 
such a story to pitiless paper. It would look so hard and 
uncompromising ; even some slight blame might take on 
the appearance of censure. Could she justify her mother, 
as she felt her justified by circumstances, without blaming 
her father in an unfilial manner ! One can mention ex- 
tenuating phases in conversation that might not be remem- 
bered in the perplexity of writing. No, she would wait. 





Such a matter soon became the theme of gossip. 
Nothing could exceed Mrs. Wilder's vexation at what 
she had always considered Eleanor's foolish and lowering 
experiment. Tom had returned with a fortune and gone 
straight to his people. 

" And if he should commence divorce proceedings," she 
groaned. "Eleanor did desert him, and it has always 
been a mystery to me where she obtained the money to 
buy out Miss Caruth. If some ugly facts should come 
out ! Married women cannot be too circumspect. Tom 
has not been near her, and considering how he went on 
before the separation, it is most ungenerous of him. I 
suppose Eleanor did insult old Mrs. Marshall that day 
she went to reason with her, and they all feel aggrieved. 
Oh, dear ! To have such a scandal !" 

"And my three daughters just blossoming into woman- 
hood ! I have been so careful of them ; " and Mrs. Mount- 
joy sighed. "American girls who enter upon careers 
like Celia Marshall, or who go traipsing over Europe for 
husbands, have been so severely criticised that I resolved 
to show that there were real mothers in America; but 
the more delicately you nurture anyone, the quicker any 
touch of scandal smirches them. A trouble like that 
would interfere seriously with their marriage prospects. 
Divorces have begun to be considered disgraceful by our 
best people, and if there could only be some law to com- 
pel husbands and wives to live together, and not bruit 
abroad their infelicities to the shame and horror of the 
respectable portion of their relatives." 

" And all that fortune ! Eleanor must turn green with 
envy ! Well, it serves her just right, although I always 
leaned more to mercy than judgment, and if praying 
would do any good, I should pray night and day that 
Tom might forgive her and take her back. I wonder if 
he could will all the money away from his family. Kate 



 

Vanduyne has enough now. Oh, what a dreadful affair 
the whole thing will prove." 

" Eleanor ought to go down on her knees to Tom for 
the sake of hushing up the matter," was the angry 
response. "Has she no regard for her own children! 
Oh, how can mothers be so wilfully, wickedly blind ! " 

They were sitting in Mrs. Wilder's pretty room, Mrs. 
Mountjoy waiting for her daughters, who had taken the 
carriage to call upon some friends while she stayed for a 
little talk. 

" I wonder what the Howarths will say now ! " went on 
Mrs. Mountjoy. " Mrs. Howarth, I believe, sets herself up 
for a sort of censor on divorced people. She actually 
would not receive that Laura Daly who went to her house 
twice, it was said, and the second time she sent down 
word that she could not see her. And Mrs. Daly had the 
best right to a divorce when Daly went off with a ballet- 
dancer." 

" But her record was not altogether clear, you know." 

" There was some gossip," in a lofty tone. " I wonder 
if she will apply the same rigorous rule to Eleanor ? " 

" But Eleanor doesn't go into society, you know. She 
has been wise enough not to give society the chance to 
refuse her, and to depend upon some special invitations 
when no other guest is invited." 

"I certainly would not hang on the hem of society's 
skirts in that cowardly fashion. Eleanor has none of the 
family spirit. I think there must have been some off 
blood in her father. And there are the Van Cleves, and 
the Brocklehursts. Ada Kingston actually invited Daisy 
Marshall to a musicale at her house, and not as a profes- 
sional either, though she sang. And she was allowed to 
dance ! I was so thankful something prevented the girls 
from going — it would have been horribly awkward. 
When milliners and such people aspire to society," and 





Mrs. Mountjoy's voice expressed the depth and height of 
the iniquity. 

There was a rustle on the stairs, and Alice Mountjoy 
came in with her card-case in her hand, her face stirred 
with some touch of eagerness and displeasure. 

" Oh, grandmamma and mamma, what do you think we 
have heard ? " and Alice threw herself gracefully into the 
low rocker. "It was at Mrs. Kingston's, Mrs. James 
Galbraith was in, and she had the loveliest brown velvet 
suit, clear silk. And she said that Tracy was engaged to 
Daisy Marshall, and the family were just delighted." 

" Tracy — who ? " asked her mother in a tone of pointed 
rebuke. 

"Mr. Tracy Galbraith," flung out Alice rather shortly. 
" And old Mr. Galbraith will give them a house, as he did 
for Mr. James. It is too utterly contemptible that girls 
of that class are allowed to go where they like and pick 
up lovers." 

" Pick them up ! that is rather more forcible than ele- 
gant, Alice, but we will have to let it pass, seeing that it 
so exactly expresses the truth. I should be ashamed to 
have my daughters going around picking up husbands in 
that manner," responded the mother loftily. 

A touch of regret swept the daughter's haughty face, 
as if, after all, a husband would not be so bad a thing to 
pick up, and set in the midst of one's life. 

"And Daisy Marshall is barely seventeen," said her 
grandmother. 

Alice colored with a sense of secret shame that she 
should be almost twenty and not even have had one prom- 
ising lover. 

"No wonder we have ill-starred marriages and divorces 
on every hand," groaned Mrs. Mountjoy. "But the 
Galbraiths do not rank very high. They are merely 
manufacturing people." 

"But Mrs. Galbraith has a pony phaeton to drive, and 



 

a very pretty house. You know papa said they were 
talking of Mr. James Galbraith for assemblyman." 

a That was merely the labor interest," in a supercilious 
manner. " They are not really in society." 

" I don't know who is in or out of society," declared 
Alice half angrily. "Miss Galbraith is going to marry 
Mr. Lasselle, and there is some talk of calling him at 
Bethany Chapel. The most stylish people go there, and 
of course they will receive her, they must. I don't see 
what a talented gentleman like Mr. Lasselle can find in 
that dowdyish girl, only, I suppose, her father will give 
her some money." 

" I am amazed at Mr. Lasselle's choice, when he could 
have looked so much higher. Clergymen ought to be 
trained to see that they owe a duty to society in the kind 
of women they place in such an important position. No 
class of men suffer more in their selection of wives," said 
Mrs. Mountjoy in an oracular manner. " And if he and 
the Galbraiths are called upon to fight their way through 
scandal — " 

" Scandal ! " interrupted Alice with an eagerness that 
did not speak volumes for the purity and refinement of 
her training. "About whom — Mrs. Marshall ? " 

"We will let Mrs. Marshall alone in her rejoicing over 
her prospective son-in-law," returned Mrs. Mountjoy dis- 
dainfully, " since she will never be likely to have another 
opportunity. Men always fight shy of a woman with a 
career, and a second or third rate artist never commands 
a very high degree of attention. But Violet is waiting 
for us," and she drew her fur-lined mantle about her. 

Violet looked ennuied and disagreeable alone in the 
carriage. Her nose was red instead of her cheeks, there 
were two very decided creases in her brow, between her 
eyes, which added the aspect of a continual frown, and 
her lips had settled into an expression of wearisome im- 





patience, which she cultivated under the impression that 
it was a high-bred languor. 

"I thought you were never coming," spitefully. "I 
am almost frozen waiting here." 

"I was telling grandmamma the news." 

" Tracy Galbraith is the biggest fool I know," was the 
short rejoinder, which was allowed to pass unchecked, as 
Mrs. Mountjoy saw that her eldest daughter was in a very 
bad temper. 

Indeed they both felt secretly wounded by the prefer- 
ence of these young men. Violet had met Mr. Lasselle 
quite frequently, and began to hope that she might pos- 
sibly attract him, when the announcement of his engage- 
ment surprised them. They met the Galbraiths in society, 
and Mr. Mountjoy always spoke of the male portion of the
