ities you have so aptly designated." 



 

There was something so odd about his manner and 
about the things he said that Nino was silent, and 
allowed him to proceed. 

" The fact is," he continued, " that love is a very 
rare thing, nowadays, and is so very generally an 
abominable sham that I have often amused myself 
by diabolically devising plans for its destruction. 
On this occasion I very nearly came to grief myself. 
The same thing happened to me some time ago, 
about forty years, I should say, and I perceive that 
it has not been forgotten. It may amuse you to look 
at this paper, which I chance to have with me. Good- 
morning. I leave for St. Petersburg at once." 

" I believe you are really the Wandering Jew !" 
cried Nino, as Benoni left the room. 

" His name was certainly Ahasuerus," Benoni re 
plied from the outer door. " But it may be a coinci 
dence, after all. Good-bye." He was gone. 

I was the first to take up the paper he had thrown 
upon a chair. There was a passage marked with a 
red pencil. I read it aloud : 

"... Baron Benoni, the wealthy banker of St. 
Petersburg, who was many years ago an inmate of 
a private lunatic asylum in Paris, is reported to be 
dangerously insane in Rome." That was all. The 
paper was the Paris " Figaro." 

" Merciful Heaven ! " exclaimed Hedwig, " and I 
was shut up with that madman in Fillettino I " 

Nino was already by her side, and in his strong 
arms she forgot Benoni, and Fillettino, and all her 
troubles. We were all silent for some time. At 
last Nino spoke. 



 

"Is it true that the count was here this morning?" 
he asked, in a subdued voice, for the extraordinary 
visit and its sequel had made him grave. 

" Quite true," I said. " He was here a long time. 
I would not spoil your pleasure by telling you of it, 
when you first came." 

" What did he what did my father say ? " asked 
Hedwig presently. 

" My dear children," I answered, thinking I might 
well call them so, " he said a great many unpleasant 
things, so that I offered to fight him if he said any 
more." 

At this they both laid hold of me and began to 
caress me ; and one smoothed my hair, and the other 
embraced me, so that I was half smothered. 

"Dear Signor Grandi," cried Hedwig anxiously, 
" how good and brave you are ! " 

She does not know what a coward I am, you see, 
and I hope she will never find it out, for nothing was 
ever said to me that gave me half so much pleasure 
as to be called brave by her, the dear child ; and if 
she never finds out, she may say it again, some day. 
Besides, I really did offer to fight Lira, as I have 
told you. 

" And what is he going to do ? " asked Nino, in 
some anxiety. 

" I do not know. I told him it was all legal, and 
that he could not touch you at all. I also said you 
were staying at the hotel Costanzi, where he might 
find you, if he wished." 

" Oh ! Did you tell him that ? " asked Hedwig. 

"It was quite right," said Nino. "He ought 



 

to know, of course. And what else did you tell 
him?" 

"Nothing especial, Nino mio. He went away in 
a sort of ill temper because I would not let him 
abuse you as much as he pleased." 

" He may abuse me and be welcome," said Nino. 
" He has some right to be angry with me. But he 
will think differently some day." 

So we chatted away for an hour, enjoying the 
rest and the peace and the sweet sunshine of the 
Easter afternoon. But this was the day of inter 
ruptions. There was one more visitor to come, 
one more scene for me to tell you, and then I have 
done. 

A carriage drove down the street and seemed to 
stop at the door of my house. Nino looked idly out 
of the window. Suddenly he started. 

" Hedwig, Hedwig ! " he cried, " here is your father 
coming back ! " 

She would not look out, but stood back from the 
window, turning pale. If there were one thing she 
dreaded, it was a meeting with her father. All the 
old doubt as to whether she had done right seemed 
to come back to her face in a moment. But Nino 
turned and looked at her, and his face was so triumphant that she got back her courage, and clasping 
his hand bravely awaited what was to come. 

I myself went to the door, and heard Lira's slow 
tread on the stairs. Before long he appeared, and 
glanced up at me from the steps, which he climbed, 
one at a time, with his stick. 

" Is my daughter here ? " he asked as soon as he 



 

reached me ; and his voice sounded subdued, just 
as Nino's did when Benoni had gone. 

I conducted him into the room. It was the 
strangest meeting. The proud old man bowed 
stiffly to Hedwig, as though he had never before 
seen her. Nino and Hedwig also bent their heads, 
and there was a silence as of death in the sunny 
room. 

"My daughter," said Von Lira at last, and with 
evident effort, "I wish to have a word with you. 
These two gentlemen the younger of whom is now, 
as I understand it, your husband may well hear 
what I wish to say." 

I moved a chair so that he might sit down, but he 
stood up to his full height, as though not deigning 
to be older than the rest. I watched Hedwig, and 
saw how with both hands she clung to Nino's arm, 
and her lip trembled, and her face wore the look it 
had when I saw her in Fillettino. 

As for Nino, his stern, square jaw was set, and his 
brows bent, but he showed no emotion, unless the 
darkness in his face and the heavy shadows beneath 
his eyes foretold ready anger. 

"I am no trained reasoner, like Signer Grandi," 
said Lira, looking straight at Hedwig, "but I can say 
plainly what I mean, for all that. There was a good 
old law in Sparta, whereby disobedient children were 
put to death without mercy. Sparta was a good 
country, very like Prussia, but less great. You 
know what I mean. You have cruelly disobeyed me, 
cruelly, I say, because you have shown me that 
all my pains and kindness and discipline have been 



 

in vain. There is nothing so sorrowful for a good 
parent as to discover that he has made a mistake." 

The canting old proser, I thought, will he never 
finish ! 

" The mistake I refer to is not in the way I have 
dealt with you," he went on, " for on that score I 
have nothing to reproach myself. But I was mis 
taken in supposing you loved me. You have de 
spised all I have done for you." 

" Oh, father ! How can you say that ? " cried poor 
Hedwig, clinging closer to Nino. 

"At all events, you have acted as though you did. 
On the very day when I promised you to take signal 
action upon Baron Benoni, you left me by stealth, 
saying in your miserable letter that you had gone to 
a man who could both love and protect you." 

"You did neither the one nor the other, sir," said 
Nino boldly, "when you required of your daughter 
to marry such a man as Benoni." 

"I have just seen Benoni; I saw him also on the 
night you left me, madam," he looked severely at 
Hedwig, " and I am reluctantly forced to confess 
that he is not sane, according to the ordinary standard 
of the mind." 

We had all known from the paper of the suspicion 
that rested on Benoni's sanity, yet somehow there 
was a little murmur in the room when the old count 
so clearly stated his opinion. 

" That does not, however, alter the position in the 
least," continued Lira, "for you knew nothing of 
this at the time I desired you to marry him, and I 
should have found it out soon enough to prevent mis- 



 

chief. Instead of trusting to my judgment, you took 
the law into your own hands, like a most unnatural 
daughter, as you are, and disappeared in the night 
with a man whom I consider totally unfit for you, 
however superior," he added, glancing at Nino, " he 
may have proved himself in his own rank of life." 

Nino could not hold his tongue any longer. It 
seemed absurd that there should be a battle of 
words when all the realities of the affair were ac 
complished facts; but for his life he could not 
help speaking. 

" Sir," he said, addressing Lira, " I rejoice that this 
opportunity is given me of once more speaking 
clearly to you. Months ago, when I was betrayed into 
a piece of rash violence, for which I at once apologised 
to you, I told you under somewhat peculiar circum 
stances that I would yet marry your daughter, if she 
would have me. I stand here to-day with her by my 
side, my wedded wife, to tell you that I have kept my 
word, and that she is mine by her own free consent. 
Have you any cause to show why she is not my wed 
ded wife? If so, show it. But I will not let you 
stand there and say bitter and undeserved things to 
this same wife of mine, abusing the name of father 
and the terms of authority and love, I forsooth I And 
if you wish to take vengeance on me personally, do so 
if you can. I will not fight duels with you now, as 
I was ready to do the day before yesterday. For 
then so short a time ago I had but offered her 
my life, and so that I gave it for her I cared not how 
nor when. But now she has taken me for hers, and 
I have no more right to let you kill me than I have 



 

to kill myself, seeing that she and I are one. Therefore, good sir, if you have words of conciliation to 
speak, speak them ; but if you would only tell her 
harsh and cruel things, I say you shall not ! " 

As Nino uttered these hot words in good, plain 
Italian, they had a bold and honest sound of strength 
that was glorious to hear. A weaker man than the 
old count would have fallen into a fury of rage, and 
perhaps would have done some foolish violence. But 
he stood silent, eyeing his antagonist coolly, and when 
the words were spoken he answered. 

" Signer Cardegna," he said, " the fact that I am 
here*ought to be to you the fullest demonstration 
that I acknowledge your marriage with my daughter. 
I have certainly no intention of prolonging a painful 
interview. When I have said that my child has dis 
obeyed me, I have said all that the question holds. 
As for the future of you two, I have naturally nothing 
more to say about it. I cannot love a disobedient 
child, nor ever shall again. For the present, we will 
part; and if at the end of a year my daughter is 
happy with you, and desires to see me, I shall make 
no objection to such a meeting. I need not say that 
if she is unhappy with you, my house will always be 
open to her if she chooses to return to it." 

" No, sir, most emphatically you need not say it ! " 
cried Nino, with blazing eyes. Lira took no notice 
of him, but turned to go. 

Hedwig would try once more to soften him, though 
she knew it was useless. 

" Father," she said, in tones of passionate entreaty, 
" will you not say you wish me well ? Will you not 



 

forgive me ? " She sprang to him, and would have 
held him back. 

" I wish you no ill," he answered, shortly, pushing 
her aside, and he marched to the door, where he 
paused, bowed as stiffly as ever, and disappeared. 

It was very rude of us, perhaps, but no one accom 
panied him to the stairs. As for me, I should not 
have believed it possible that any human being could 
be so hard and relentlessly virtuous ; and if I had 
wondered at first that Hedwig should have so easily 
made up her mind to flight, I was no longer surprised 
when I saw with my own eyes how he could treat her. 

I cannot, indeed, conceive how she could have 
borne it so long, for the whole character of the man 
came out, hard, colo&gt;, and narrow, such a character 
as must be more hideous than any description can 
paint it, when seen in the closeness of daily conversa 
tion. But when he was gone the sun appeared to 
shine again, as he had shone all day, though it had 
sometimes seemed so dark. The storms were in that 
little room. 

As Lira went out, Nino, who had followed Hed 
wig closely, caught her in his arms, and once more 
her face rested on his broad breast. I sat down and 
pretended to be busy with a pile of old papers which 
lay near my hand on the table, but I could hear what 
they said. The dear children, they forgot all about 
me. 

" I am so sorry, dear one," said Nino, soothingly. 

"I know you are, Nino. But it cannot be helped." 

"But are you sorry, too, Hedwig? " he asked, strok 
ing her hair. 



 

" That my father is angry? Yes. I wish he were 
not," said she, looking wistfully toward the door. 

" No, not that," said Nino. " Sorry that you left 
him, I mean." 

" Ah, no, I am not sorry for that. Oh, Nino, dear 
Nino, your love is best." And again she hid her 
face. 

" We will go away at once, darling," he said, after 
a minute, during which I did not see what was going 
on. " Would you like to go away ? " 

Hedwig moved her head to say " Yes." 

"We will go, then, sweetheart. Where shall it 
be?" asked Nino, trying to distract her thoughts 
from what had just occurred. "London? Paris? 
Vienna? I can sing anywhere now, but you must 
always choose, love." 

"Anywhere, anywhere; only always with you, 
Nino, till we die together." 

"Always, till we die, my beloved," he repeated. 
The small white hands stole up and clasped about 
his broad throat, tenderly drawing his face to hers, 
and hers to his. And it will be " always," till they 
die together, I think. 

This is the story of that Roman singer whose great 
genius is making such a stir in the world. I have 
told it to you, because he is my own dear boy, as I 
have often said in these pages ; and because people 
must not think that he did wrong to carry Hedwig 
von Lira away from her father, nor that Hedwig was 
so very unfilial and heartless. I know that they were 
both right, and the day will come when old Lira will 
acknowledge it. He is a hard old man, but he must 
have some affection for her ; and if not, he will surely 
have the vanity to own so famous an artist as Nino 
for his son-in-law. 

I do not know how it was managed, for Hedwig 
was certainly a heretic when she left her father, 
though she was an angel, as Nino said. But before 
they left Rome for Vienna there was a little wedding,
