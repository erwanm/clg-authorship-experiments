" You take her time for so much compensation, but, 
after all, she has only one pair of hands. She has to 
hurry through with one thing to go at the next. Sup- 



 

pose there were certain things about your own room 
or your own clothing that you undertook. You 
would have more leisure and could do it better, 
doubtless, after a little practice." 

Ada was thoughtful and silent. They had fallen 
into careless habits at home, because the upper ser- 
vant found her hands pretty full in being nurse, 
chambermaid, and ordinary seamstress. Buttons and 
strings were always off, the parlor went undusted, 
and dozens of petty things that might have been 
comforts were positive trials. 

"And is there no one you could make hap- 
pier ? " 

Her mother was not such a woman as Mrs. Alston. 
Ada doubted in her heart if she could understand or 
in any way acknowledge the small sweet courtesies 
that won so bright a smile from Mrs. Alston or 
Uncle Eobert. And the children But then she 
did not like children, and Kathie did. There was 
papa She remembered now how tired and worn he 
sometimes looked. Could she do anything for him ? 
Slowly awakening conscience told her that she might 
try at least. 

"And there is your own health, my dear child. 



 

You see now how easy it is, with no positive disease, 
to fall into the most helpless of invalid habits through 
sheer inaction. There must be work and interest to 
every life ; those are inexorable conditions, or the life 
ceases to be what God designed, and is wrenched 
from its true purpose, becomes stunted and fruit- 
less. So that if you make it a simple question of 
health even, you see how much is lost by frittering 
it away." 

" But I don't love to work. It is hard and unpleas- 
ant to me." 

" There is no necessity for your beginning at the 
drudgery end " ; and Mrs. Alston smiled. " There 
are so many light and simple deeds that seem like 
matters of mere courtesy, and yet are some of the 
sweetest proofs we can offer another of our love. 
But the true secret lies behind all this. As God 
has loved us we are to love one another, and ho 
renounced the best of all for our sakes. Can we not 
give up a little of self for his ? " 

Ada seemed so far away from this knowledge. She 
had gone to church occasionally, and the family 
called themselves Christian people, but how seldom 
had God entered into any of their ways or thoughts. 



 

Was it this that made so great a difference between 
them ? 

She had been used to thinking of religion as a 
gloomy and austere thing. Her mother, too, had 
sneered a little at Uncle Edward's becoming so over- 
pious, as she termed it. But he had acted nobly, it 
must be confessed, and all these people led lives a 
hundred times more satisfying than hers. She sighed 
over her perplexity, that was not yet cleared up, but 
she did half resolve to try if she could better her 
own vapid, profitless life. At least, henceforward she 
would not refuse through pride any good thing that 
might come into it. 

Uncle Eobert and Mr. Langdon walked up the 
path, and in a few moments the carriage came round. 

" I thought you were not going until after tea," 
Mrs. Alston exclaimed. 

" yes ; I promised this morning, if Miss Ada 
would not mind. Kathie desired it so much." 

" I believe I shall like it," Ada answered, with a 
smile, and she went for her hat. 

" Kathie's leaven begins to work," Uncle Eobert 
said, with a smile. " If Ada could develop into 
anything really noble, Meredith would be more than 



 

delighted. He thinks he owes his best lesson to our 
darling." 

" I believe I have always had a little prejudice 
against Ada, but I am sincerely glad to do anything 
for her, or to have Kathie." 



 



CHAPTER X. 

GLEAMS BY THE WAY. 

MR. LANGDON rode over to the Lauristons' with 
them. They caught a glimpse of Emma at the win- 
dow, and the fair face flushed rosily as he sprang out. 

A curious feeling came over Ada Meredith. The 
interest Mr. Langdon had evinced in her music, and 
the odd little snatches of talk that he occasionally fell 
into, had given her a peculiar interest in him. Dick 
and Charlie and Fred listened and complimented and 
played games with her, but, after all, they were only 
boys ; he had not Uncle Eobert's fatherly ways, nor 
their crudeness. Perhaps Ada's vanity had been 
touched by the attentions. 

A spasm of the old jealous feeling stole over her. 
She did not love to share whatever was hers with 
any other person, and that Emma should show her 
gladness at his coming, that he should appear so 
pleased with her wordless recognition But what if 

their friendship was older, certainly, and it might 



 

be something deeper than friendship. Ada had been 
quick to spy out the meaning of such things. 

Then she suddenly checked her surmises, and put 
aside her pained, exacting self. Why should not Mr. 
Langdon care for Emma ? and why should she thrust 
away the simple pleasures of friendship because an- 
other had something sweeter and finer ? 

So the cloudy brow cleared up, and the perplexity 
seemed to roll away like a summer mist. Strange, 
too, she felt better after the effort had been made, and 
she resolved as well not to whisper her suspicion to 
Kathie, to take pattern by the child's delicacy and 
reticence. 

They had a lovely drive, and found a group gath- 
ered at the wide-open hall door to welcome them. 
Farmer Strong and his sons had made a little im- 
provement at the front this spring. There was a new 
fence and a neat gate, and two clumps of evergreens 
beautified the old-fashioned door-yard. Then the 
stone steps had been relaid, and the whole place 
wore an improved air. 

Mr. and Mrs. Strong were profuse in their welcome. 
Indeed, they esteemed the visit of any friend of 
Kathie as quite a compliment. Ada took off her hat 

and sack in the best room, gave a glance at herself 
in the old-fashioned glass, and then they were all 
marshalled out to supper. 

The table literally groaned with good things. To 
be sure, the China was in the most glaring of colors, 
and the forks steel, with only two tines ; but the cloth 
was snowy white and thick as velvet, and napkins, 
and the most generous hospitality. The " children " 
were ranged down one side, with Cousin Ellen to look 
after them, and Ada admitted that they behaved very 
well, if they were rather free with their English. 

" Your friend doesn't look very rugged, Miss Kathie. 
City girls are 'most always pale and thin. They stay 
in the house, sit up late nights, and lace too much, 
and then never have any appetite. Why, child, you 
don't eat enough to keep a mouse alive ! " 

Ada blushed and smiled, yet appeared a little dis- 
mayed at the quantity on her plate, that she had 
taken to please Mrs. Strong. Kathie explained that 
her friend had been an invalid for some time. 

" There is nothing in the world like good country 
air and wholesome food," declared the farmer, " and 
then not too much study. Gals get worn out before 
they are women nowadays." 

Sarah colored warmly. She did not want hei 
father to air his pet hobby before Kathie's stylish 
friend, and changed the conversation with a grace 
that one would hardly have expected. Uncle Eobert 
understood it and assisted, meeting Sarah's quick, 
grateful glance. How much tact, and what a fine 
sense the girl was developing ! 

Presently the strangeness wore off, and they were 
all exceedingly cordial. Even Ada seemed to catch 
the infection, and laid aside her sense of dignity, for- 
got the obtrusive self that usually haunted her. 

They had the loveliest of moonlight to ride home 
in, though the Strongs would fain have kept them 
later in the evening. 

Kathie leaned back in her seat and gave a halt- 
sigh. 

" Are you tired ? " asked her uncle. 

" Pleasantly tired " ; and she smiled a little. " I
had to go all over the farm to see every new tree and 
shrub, and the horses and cows and chickens, and 
everything. We have talked steadily, I believe, 
and I feel as if I had been ' out visiting.' It was 
very good of you to come, Ada, and gives you a little 
glimpse of real country. I hope you were not wearied." 


" On the contrary, I was a good deal interested. 
But how do they manage with so many children ? ' 

" I suppose it doesn't seem a great many to them. 
And how nice it will be when they are grown up and 
married, and come home to Thanksgiving dinners ! I 
wish we had a dozen children." 

Ada thought how often she had wished herself an 
only child, and how, since the reverse of fortune, she 
had almost grudged the money spent upon the others. 
Ah, how narrow and selfish her soul really was ! 

" How generous it was of you to take so much 
pains with that Sarah Strong ! ' Ada said, as they 
were preparing for bed. " But I should be afraid 
that people of that stamp would presume." 

" If there is anything nice, and any lifting up in 
this world, why shouldn't they get their share ? 
And I often think they have more real, true deli- 
cacy than many of whom you might rightfully ex- 
pect it." 

" That was going out of the way to find work, I am 
sure," Ada said, with a half-smile, rather doubtful, as 
if she was not fully satisfied. 

" Was it ? No, I think it came right in my way. 
And it seemed to be one of the very ' least of these.' 



ver since all the good and enchanting fortune came 
to me I have been trying to give thanks, not in words 
only, but in making other lives a little bit pleasanter, 
if I could ; and I feel as if it was the poor and barren 
ways that wanted to be taught to blossom, not those 
with roses already in them." 

A great choking seemed to rise in Ada's throat. 
Something had been in her heart for many days, at 
times vexing her through very perverseness, and then 
rendering her grateful in spite of herself. 

" I heard,' she began, in a low tone, averting her 
face, " that you might have gone to the White Moun- 
tains with a pleasant party. You gave it up in order 
to" 

" Not altogether," exclaimed Kathie, with a quick 
flush and a little quiver through all her pulses. 
Mamma could not go, nor Emma, and I would 
rather have stayed at home anyhow. But I am 
very glad if ' 

" It has been a pleasant visit, and I have improved 
in health, perhaps in some other ways as well. You 
were very kind to think of it, to do it. Good night." 

Ada's voice was husky, and she turned abruptly 
away. Kathie did not feel slighted because there 



 

was no warmer demonstration. She understood that 
it would be very hard for Ada, after always having 
held herself loftily above her, to confess herself in 
any secondary position. And Kathie had learned the 
grandest and sweetest part of Divine charity, not to 
seek her own. It was enough that the work was 
done. So long as the sheaves came in, it made little 
difference whether they were laid at her feet or not. 

" The boys are on their homeward route," said 
Uncle Eobert one morning. " Eob is in despair 
because vacation is so nearly over." 

Mrs. Alston smiled. Eob would be himself only 
to the end of boyhood, or even life. 

Ada had letters too. A brief, rather fault-finding, 
note from her mother, and quite a lengthy letter from 
her father. He had been spending several days at the 
seaside, but from the tone of his reference to it Ada 
judged that it had not been much of a rest or refresh- 
ment. He seemed, indeed, weary and discouraged. 
Their cook was discharged, and the house shut up. 
Edward had insisted upon his brother's sharing his 
home comforts, which he had been very glad to do. 
Was it the difference in love and devotion and ten- 
derness that so moved him ? 



 

Ada's eyes had been opened to many things. Here- 
tofore it seemed as if she and her mother had been 
the greatest sufferers by their reverses. Had not her 
father lost incalculably as well ? In past times his 
home had proved bright and elegant, made so by an 
abundance of money and choice serving, rather than 
that any one had studied his comfort. Now there 
were toilsome, perplexing days, but who ever tried to 
brighten the evenings ? Her mother was full of the 
worry of servants and the many privations she had to 
endure, or, if there were no guests in, often spent 
the evening on the sofa with a headache. He was 
trying to make it better for them all, but was it 
not their duty to do something in return ? 

According to Aunt Ruth, the boys had enjoyed 
themselves royally, and been no trouble to anybody. 
They had fished and hunted, explored rivers and 
mountains and the camps of friendly Indians, been 
lost two or three times, and had several hair-breadth 
escapes. And, above all, she confessed to Kathie that 
Bruce was the tenderest and manliest of sons. 

The days flew by so rapidly that, before one was 
really expecting it, a telegram came from New York, 
announcing that a whole party were on their way to 



 

Brookside, the two others being Jessie and Mr. Mere- 
dith. So they made ready to welcome them, and 
went over to the station in the great family car- 



riage. 



Somebody gave a shout as the train stopped. Eob, 
of course. There he was, so brown you could hardly 
see the roses on his cheeks, and with his curly hair 
cropped close ; but nothing could ever take the laugh- 
ing twinkle out of his eyes. 

" Isn't it jolly ? Kathie, how white you are, 
a regular pale-face ! Dear Uncle Rob ! How is 
mother, and Fred, and everybody ? Ada ! " Rob 
stopped there and blushed, and Bruce came up to share 
the honors of the occasion. 

Kathie really felt shy of him, a veritable young 
man, taller than Uncle Robert, and with a soft dark 
mustache, as dainty as if it had grown according to 
order. Ada received him in her graceful, ladylike 
way, but Kathie scarcely spoke at all, and blushed 
every time the dark eyes were turned upon her. 

" How are you, Meredith ? ' and Uncle Robert
