instinctive understanding of each other, though these 
things implied neither mutual respect nor affection. 

"That horrible old Volterra! " said the Princess, 
with emphasis. " He means to keep everything he has 
found, for himself, if he can. I have come only just in 
time." 

Sabina did not answer. She knew nothing of the 
law, and though she fancied that she might have some 
morally just claim to a share in the treasure, she had 
never believed that it could be proved. 

" Of course," the Princess continued, smoking 
thoughtfully, "there is only one thing to be done. 
You must marry this Malipieri at once, whether you 
like him or not. What sort of man is he ? " 

The faint colour rose in Sabina's cheeks and not al- 
together at the mere thought of marrying Malipieri; 
she was hurt by the way her mother spoke of him. 

" What kind of man is he ? " the Princess repeated. 
"I suppose he is a Venetian, a son of the man who 





married the Gradenigo heiress, about the time when I 
was married myself. Is he the man who discovered 
Troy ? " 

" Carthagj, I think," said Sabina. 

"Troy, Carthage, America, it is all the same. He 
discovered something, and I fancy he will be rich. 
But what is he like ? Dark, fair, good, bad, snuffy or 
smart ? As he is an archaeologist, he must be snuffy, 
a bore, probably, and what the English call a male 
frump. It cannot be helped, my dear ! You will 
have to marry him. Describe him to me." 

" He is dark," said Sabina. 

" I am glad of that. I always liked dark men — 
your father was fair, like you. Besides, as you are 
a blonde, you will always look better beside a dark 
husband. But of course he is dreadfully careless, with 
long hair and doubtful nails. All those people are." 

" No," said Sabina. " He is very nice-looking and 
neat, and wears good clothes." 

The Princess's brow cleared. 

"All the better," she said. "Well, my dear, it is 
not so bad after all. We have found a husband for 
you, rich, of good family — quite as good as yours, 
my child ! Good-looking, smart — what more do you 
expect? Besides, he cannot possibly refuse to marry 
you after what has happened. On the whole, I think 
your adventure has turned out rather well. You can 
be married in a month. Every one will think it quite 
natural that it should have been kept quiet until I 
came, you see." 



 

" But even if I wanted to marry him, he will never 
ask for me," objected Sabina, who was less surprised 
than might be expected, for she knew her mother 
thoroughly. 

The Princess laughed, and blew a cloud of smoke 
from her lips, and then showed her handsome teeth. 

"I have only to say the word," she answered. 
" When a young girl of our world has spent the night 
in a man's rooms, he marries her, if her family wishes 
it. No man of honour can possibly refuse. I suppose 
that this Malipieri is a gentleman ? " 

" Indeed he is ! " Sabina spoke with considerable 
indignation. 

"Precisely. Then he will come to me this after- 
noon and tell his story frankly, just as you have done 
— it was very sensible of you, my dear — and he will 
offer to marry you. Of course I shall accept." 

" But, mother," cried Sabina, aghast at the sudden- 
ness of the conclusion, " I am not at all sure — " 

She stopped, feeling that she was much more sure 
of being in love with Malipieri than she had been 
when she had driven to the palace with Sassi on the 
previous afternoon. 

" Is there any one you like better ? " asked the 
Princess sharply. " Are you in love with any one else ? " 

"No! But — " 

"I had never seen your father when our marriage 
was arranged," the Princess observed. 

"And you were very unhappy together," Sabina 
answered promptly. "You always say so." 





" Oh, unhappy ? I am not so sure, now. Certainly 
not nearly so miserable as half the people I know. 
After all, what is happiness, child ? Doing what you 
please, is it not ? " 

Sabina had not thought of this definition, and she 
laughed, without accepting it. In one way, everything 
looked suddenly bright and cheerful, since her mother 
had believed her story, and she knew that she was not 
to go back to the Baroness, who had not believed her 
at all, and had called her bad names. 

" And I almost always did as I pleased," the Princess 
continued, after a moment's reflection. "The only 
trouble was that your dear father did not always like 
what I did. He was a very religious man. That was 
what ruined us. He gave half his income to charities 
and then scolded me because I could not live on the 
other half. Besides, he turned the Ten Command- 
ments into a hundred. It was a perfect multiplication 
table of things one was not to do." 

Poor Sabina's recollections of her father had nothing 
of affection in them, and she did not feel called upon to 
defend his memory. Like many weak but devout men, 
he had been severe to his children, even to cruelty, 
while perfectly incapable of controlling his wife's 
caprices. 

" I remember, though I was only a little girl when he 
died," Sabina said. 

" Is Malipieri very religious ? " the Princess asked. 
"I mean, does he make a fuss about having fish on 
Fridays?" She spoke quite gravely. 



 

" I fancy not," Sabina answered, seeing nothing odd 
in her mother's implied definition of righteousness. 
"He never talked to me about religion, I am sure." 

" Thank God ! " exclaimed the Princess devoutly. 

" He always says he is a republican," Sabina remarked, 
glad to talk about him. 

" Really ? " The Princess was interested. " I adore 
revolutionaries," she said thoughtfully. " They always 
have something to say. I have always longed to meet 
a real anarchist." 

" Signer Malipieri is not an anarchist," said Sabina. 

" Of course not, child ! I never said he was. All 
anarchists are shoemakers or miners, or something like 
that. I only said that I always longed to meet one. 
People who do not value their lives are generally amus- 
ing. When I was a girl, I was desperately in love 
with a cousin of mine who drove a four-in-hand down 
a flight of steps, and won a bet by jumping on a wild 
bear's back. He was always doing those things. I 
loved him dearly." The Princess laughed. 

" What became of him ? " Sabina asked. 

"He shot himself one day in Geneva, poor boy, 
because he was bored. I was always sorry, though 
they would not have let me marry him, because he 
had lost all his money at cards." The Princess sighed. 
" Of course you want a lot of new clothes, my dear," 
she said, changing the subject rather suddenly. " Have 
you nothing but that to wear ? " 

Sabina's things had not yet come from the Via 
Ludovisi. She explained that she had plenty of clothes. 





" I fancy they are nothing but rags," her mother 
answered incredulously. " We shall have to go to 
Paris in any case for your trousseau. You cannot 
get anything here." 

" But we have no money," objected Sabina. 

" As if that made any difference ! We can always 
get money, somehow. What a child you are ! " 

Sabina said nothing, for she knew that her mother 
always managed to have what she wanted, even when 
it looked quite impossible. The girl had been brought 
up in the atmosphere of perpetual debt and borrowing 
which seemed natural to the Princess, and nothing of 
that sort surprised her, though it was all contrary to 
her own instinctively conscientious and honourable 
nature. 

Her mother had always been a mystery to her, and 
now, as Sabina sat near her, she crossed her feet, which 
were encased in a pair of the Princess's slippers, and 
looked at her as she had often looked before, wondering 
how such a reckless, scatter-brained, almost penniless 
woman could have remained the great personage which 
the world always considered her to be, and that,,too, 
without the slightest effort on her part to maintain her 
position. 

Then Sabina reflected upon the Baroness's existence, 
which was one long struggle to reach a social elevation 
not even remotely rivalling that of the Princess Conti ; 
a struggle in which she was armed with a large fortune, 
with her husband's political power, with the most 
strictly virtuous views of life, and an iron will; a 



 

struggle which could never raise her much beyond the 
point she had already reached. 

Sabina's meditations were soon interrupted by the 
arrival of her . belongings, in charge of her mother's 
maid, and the immediate necessity of dressing more 
carefully than had been possible when she had been so 
rudely roused by the Baroness. She was surprised to 
find herself so little tired by the desperate adventure, 
and without even a cold as the result of the never-to- 
be-forgotten chill she had felt in the vaults. 

In the afternoon, the Princess declared that she 
would not go out. She was sure that Malipieri would 
present himself, and she would receive him in her 
boudoir. The ambassador had given her a very pretty 
set of rooms. He was a bachelor, and was of course 
delighted to have her stay with him, and still more 
pleased that her pretty daughter should join her. It 
was late in the season, he was detained in Rome by an 
international complication, and he looked upon the 
arrival of the two guests as a godsend, more especially 
as the Princess was an old acquaintance of his and the 
wife of an intimate friend. Nothing could have been 
more delightful, and everything was for the best. The 
Princess herself felt that fortune was shining upon her, 
for she never doubted that she could lay hands on some 
of the money which the statues would bring, and she 
was sure, at least, of marrying Sabina extremely well 
in a few weeks, which was an advantage not to be 
despised. 

During the hours that followed her first conversation 





with her mother, Sabina found time to reflect upon her 
own future, and the more she thought of it, the more 
rosy it seemed. She was sure that Malipieri loved her, 
though he had certainly not told her so yet, and she 
was sure that she had never met a man whom she liked 
half so much. It was true that she had not met many, 
and none at all in even such intimacy as had estab- 
lished itself between him and her at their very first 
meeting ; but that mattered little, and last night she 
had seen him as few women ever see a man, fighting 
for her life and his own for hours together, and win- 
ning in the end. Indeed, had she known it, their situ- 
ation had been really desperate, for while Masin was in 
prison and in ignorance of what had happened, and 
Sassi lying unconscious at the hospital after a fall that 
had nearly killed him outright, it was doubtful 
whether any one else could have guessed that they 
were in the vaults or would have been able to get them 
out alive, had it been known. 

She had always expected to be married against her 
will by her mother, or at all events without any incli- 
nation on her own part. She had been taught that it 
was the way of the world, which it was better to accept. 
If the proposed husband had been a cripple, or an old 
man, she would have been capable of rebellion, of 
choosing the convent, of running away alone into the 
world, of almost anything. But if he had turned out 
to be an average individual, neither uglier, nor older, 
nor more repulsive than many others, she would prob- 
ably have accepted her fate with indifference, or at 



 

least with the necessary resignation, especially if she 
had never met Malipieri. Instead of that, it was prob- 
ably Malipieri whom she was to marry, the one of all 
others whom she had chosen for herself, and in place 
of a dreary existence, stretching out through endless 
blank years in the future, she saw a valley of light, 
carpeted with roses, opening suddenly iu the wilderness 
to receive her and the man she loved. 

It was no wonder that she smiled in her sleep as she 
lay resting in the warm afternoon, in her own room. 
Her mother had made her lie down, partly because she 
was still tired, and partly because it would be con- 
venient that she should be out of the way if Malipieri 
came. 

He came, as the Princess had expected, and between 
two and three o'clock, an hour at which he was almost 
sure to find her at home. From what Sabina had said 
to the Baroness in his presence, and from his judgment 
of the girl's character, he felt certain that she would 
tell her mother the whole story at once. As they had 
acknowledged to each other in the vaults, they were 
neither of them good at inventing falsehoods, and 
Sabina would surely tell the truth. In the extremely 
improbable case that she had not been obliged to 
say anything about the events of the night, his visit 
would not seem at all out of place. He had seen a 
good deal of Sabina during her mother's absence, and 
it was proper that he should present himself in order to 
make the Princess's acquaintance. 

He studied her face quickly as he came forward, and 





made up his mind that she expected him, though she 
looked up with an air of languid surprise as he entered. 
She leaned forward a little in her comfortable seat, and 
held out her plump hand. 

"I think I knew your mother, and my daughter has 
told me about you," she said. " I am glad to see you." 

" You are very kind," Malipieri answered, raising her 
hand to his lips, which encountered a large, cool sap- 
phire. " I have had the pleasure of meeting Donna 
Sabina several times." 

" Yes, I know." The Princess laughed. " Sit down 
here beside me, and tell me all about your strange 
adventure. You are really the man I mean, are you 
not?" she asked, still smiling. "Your mother was a 
Gradenigo ? " 

" Yes. My father is alive. You may have met him, 
though he rarely leaves Venice." 

" I think I have, years ago, but I am not sure. Does 
he never come to Rome ? " 

" He is an invalid now," Malipieri explained gravely. 
" He cannot leave the house." 

" Indeed? I am very sorry. It must be dreadful to 
be an invalid. I was never ill in my life. But now 
that we have made acquaintance, do tell me all about 
last night! Were you really in danger, as- Sabina 
thinks, or is she exaggerating?" 

" There was certainly no exaggeration in saying that 
we were in great danger, as matters have turned out," 
Malipieri answered. " Of the two men who knew that 
we were in the vault, one is Ipng insensible, with a 



 

fractured skull, in the hospital of the Consolazione, and 
the other has been arrested by a mistake and is in 
prison. Besides, both of them would have had every 
reason to suppose that we had got out." 

" Sabina did not tell me that. How awful ! I must
