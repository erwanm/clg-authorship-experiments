" Nobody to do anything, I mean." 

" Can't they do anything? I don't know 
what you are talking of, Matilda; but I know 
I want my dinner." 

" Who do you think will get dinner to- 
morrow ? " 

" Well mother's sick of course ; and Anne 
and Letty are going. I should think aunt 
Candy might." 

" No, she won't." 

" How do you know ? " 

" Because mother said so. She won't do 
anything." 

" Then she'll have to get a girl to do things, 
I suppose." 

" But Maria, that is just what mother wants 
she shouldn't do ; because she'd have to pay 
for it." 



 

" Who would have to pay for it?" 

" Mamma." 

" Why would she ? " 

" She said so." 

" I don't see why she would, I am sure. 
If aunt Erminia hires a girl, she'll pay for 
her." 

" But that will come out of what aunt Erminia pays to mamma ; and what aunt 
Erminia pays to mamma is what we have got 
to live upon." 

"Who said so?" 

" Mamma said so." Matilda answered with 
her lip trembling; for the bringing facts all 
down to hard detail, was difficult to bear. 

Well I do think," exclaimed Maria, " if I 
had a sister sick and not able to help herself, 
I would not be so mean ! " 

Matilda sat still and cried and said noth- 
ing. 

" Who is going to do all the work then, 
Tilly ? " 

There would have been something comical, 



 

if it had not been sad, in the way the little 
girl looked up and said, " You and I." 

" I guess we will!" said Maria with open- 
ing eyes. " You and I ! Take care of the 
house, and wash the dishes, and cook the din- 
ner, and everything! You know we couldn't, 
Matilda; and what's more, 7 know we 
won't." 

" Yes, mamma wishes it. We must ; and 
so we can, Maria." 

" I can't," said Maria, taking down her 
school cloak. 

" But Maria ! we must. Marnma will be 
more sick if we do not ; you heard what aunt 
Candy said at breakfast, that she is fearfully 
nervous; and if she hears that there is a 
hired girl in the house, it will worry her dread- 
fully." 

" It will be aunt Candy's fault then," said 
Maria, fastening her cloak. " I never heard 
of anybody so mean in all my life! never." 

" But that don't help anything, Maria. 
And you and I must do what mamma said. 



You know we shall have little enough to 
live on, as it is, and if you take the pay of 
a hired girl out of it, there will be so little 
left." 

" I've got my twenty-five dollars, that I can 
get summer dresses with ; I am glad I haven't 
spent it," said Maria. " Corne, Tilly ; I'm 
going home." 

" But Maria, you have not said what you 
ought to say yet." 

What ought I to say ? " 

" I will help and do my part. We can 
manage it. Come, Maria, say that you 
will." 

" Your part," said Maria. " What do you 
suppose your part would come to ? What 
can such a child as you do ? " 

" Maria, now is the time to shew whether 
you are really one of the Band of workers." 

" I am, of course. I joined it." 

" That would not make you one of them, 
if you don't do what they promised to do." 

"When did I ever promise to be aunt 




 

Candy's servant girl ? " said Maria fiercely 
I should like to know." 

But ' we are the servants of Christ,' " said 
Matilda softly, her eyes glistening through 



What then?" 

" We promised to try to do whatever would 
honour him." 

" I don't know what all this affair has to 
do with it," said Maria. " You say we 
promised ; you didn't ? " 

Yes, I did." 

" You didn't join the Band ? " 

Yes, I did." 

"When?" 

" A few days after you did." 

Why didn't you tell me? Did you tell 
Mr. Richmond?" 

Yes." 

" I think it is mean, that you did not tell 
me." 

" I am telling you now. But now, Maria, 
you know what you promised." 



 

" I did not promise this sort of thing at all, 
Tilly." 

" Yes, don't you know ? ' we stand ready 
to do his will.' That's in the covenant." 

" But this is not his will," insisted Maria. 
" This is aunt Erminia's meanness." 

" But it certainly is his will that we should 
do what mamma says, and please her ; and 
this is the work he has given us to do." 

Maria's answer this time was to sit down 
and cry for her part. Matilda did not join 
her, but stood by, patiently waiting. Maria 
cried and sobbed for several minutes; then 
she started up and set off homewards at a 
furious rate. Matilda gathered together her 
books and followed her sister; trying to comfort herself with the thought that this was 
certainly the work given them to do, and that 
she would try and make the best of it. 

The dinner was sorrowful enough. Maria 
indeed eat it as if remembering it was the 
last dinner for some time to come that she 
would find ready prepared for her. But 



 

Anne and Letty were broken down with 
grief ; and Mrs. Candy's endeavours to comfort them were either not the right sort, or 
fell upon unready ears. Clarissa was composed as usual. 

" You were late from school, Maria and 
Matilda," their aunt remarked ; finding Anne 
and Letty unmanageable. " What was the 
reason ? " 

" Tilly was talking to me," Maria 
said. 

" You could talk on the way home, I should 
think. I dislike to have dinner eaten by 
stages ; first one set coming, and then another. 
I am going to ask you to be punctual for the 
future. Do not be in a hurry, Maria ; there 
is time enough, now you are here, to eat 
moderately." 

" I am hungry. I don't want to eat 
moderately, aunt Erminia." 

" As much as you wish ; but you can be 
moderate in manner, cannot you, even if not 
in quantity ? " 


" Nobody ever told me I eat too much, before," said Maria. 

" There are a great many things that you 
have never been told, I suppose ? " said 
Clarissa, lifting her handsome eyes quietly. 

" I don't care about your telling me either," 
said Maria. 

" My dear, that is not polite," interposed 
her aunt. " I am sorry to hear you speak so. 
Would you not like to have Issa, or any 
one, tell you things that you would be the 
better for ? You would not wish to remain 
just as you are, to the end of your days? " 

" It don't hurt anybody but me," said 
Maria. 

" I beg your pardon. Everything that is 
not graceful and well-mannered, on the part 
of people in whose company we are, hurts me 
and Clarissa. It hurts me to have you bolt 
down your food as you were doing just now 
if I am sitting at the same table with you 
And it hurts me to have you speak rudely. 
I hope you will mend in all these things." 




"It will not hurt you to have us say 
good-bye," sa5d Anne rising. " I will do 
that now, if you please. Letty, I will leave 
you to take care of these things, and I 
will finish the packing. We must be quick, 
too." 

The farewell greetings with her aunt and 
cousin were soon spoken ; and Maria and Matilda tore upstairs after their sister, to pour 
out tears and complaints together during the 
remaining moments of her being at home. 
Matilda's tears however were quiet and her 
words very few. 

" Ain't she too bad ! " exclaimed Maria. 

" You must try and hold your own the best 
you can," said Anne ; " until mamma gets 
up again. Poor children! I am afraid she 
will be too much for you." 

"But, Anne, did you think aunt Candy 
was like that ? " said Maria. " She wasn't 
like that at first." 

" I guess she was. All she wanted was a 
chance. Now she's got it. Try and bear it 



 

the best you can, till marnma is well. She 
cannot be worried now." 

"Is mamma very sick, Anne?" Matilda 
ventured. 

N-o," said Anne, " but she might be, Tiliy, 
if she was worried. The doctor says she is 
very nervous, and must be kept quiet. She 
has been worrying so long, you see. So 
you must try and not do anything to fret 
her." 

The prospect was sad. When the omni- 
bus came to take Anne and Letty to the sta- 
tion, and when the last kisses and hugs were 
over, and the omnibus bounced away, carrying with it all they had at the moment, the 
two girls left at home felt forlorn enough. 
The only thing to be done was to rush upstairs to their room and cry their hearts out. 
And that was done thoroughly. 

But by and by, Matilda's thoughts, in their 
very extreme need of comfort, began to take 
up the words again which she had once found 
so good: " Cast thy burden upon the Lord; 



 

he shall sustain thee." She left her sobbing, 
dried her eyes, sat down by the window, and 
found the place in her Bible, that her eyes 
might have the comfort of seeing and reading 
the words there. The Lord's words: Tilly 
knew they were true. But Maria sobbed on. 
At last her little sister called her. 

"What is it?" said she. 

" Come here, and I will shew you some- 
thing good." 

"Good? what?" said Maria, approach- 
ing the window. " O, words in the Bible! " 

" Read, Maria." 

" I have read them before," said the other 
sullenly, after she had glanced at the place. 

" But they are true, Maria." 

Well they don't help me." 

"But they help we," said Matilda. "It's 
Jesus' promise to help." 

" I don't believe it is for such things as 
this." 

"Why not?" said Matilda, a sudden chili 
coming over her heart. " It says just, ' Cast 



 

thy burden' it might be any burden; it 
does not signify what it is, Maria." 

" Yes, it does ; it is not for such little 
things," said Maria. " It is for great religious people and their affairs. Oh dear! oh 
dear!" 

Sorely troubled now at having her supports 
knocked away from under her, Matilda eagerly sought further, if perchance she might find 
something that Maria could not question. 
Her Bible had a few references in the margin ; consulting these, she presently found 
what she had need of; but a feeling of want 
of sympathy between them forbade her to 
shew the new words to her sister. Matilda 
pored over them with great rest of heart; 
gave thanks for them; and might have used 
with truth David's language "Thy words 
were found, and I did eat them." The words 
were these : 

" Be careful for nothing ; but in everything, 
by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, 
let your requests be made known unto God
