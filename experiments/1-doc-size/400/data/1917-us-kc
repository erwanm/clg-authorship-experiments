" There's a saying," said he — " once a striker, always 
a striker. Find a way to get some education for your- 
self, Mary, and when the big strike comes you'll be one of 
those the miners look to. I'll not be here, I know — the 
young people must take my place." 

" I'll do my part," she answered. Her voice was low; 
it was a kind of benediction the old man was giving her. 

The woman had gone downstairs to attend to her chil- 
dren ; she came back now to say that there was a gentleman 
at the door, who wanted to know when his brother was 
coming. Hal remembered suddenly — Edward had been 
pacing up and down all this while, with no company but a 
" hardware drummer ! " The younger brother's resolve to 
stay in Pedro had already begun to weaken somewhat, and 
now it weakened still further ; he realised that life is com- 
plex, that duties conflict ! He assured the old miner again 
of his ability to see that he did not suffer from want, and 
then he bade him farewell for a while. 

He started out, and Mary went as far as the head of the 
stairway with him. He took the girl's big, rough hand in 
his — this time with no one to see. " Mary," he said, " I 
want you to know that nothing will make me forget you; 
and nothing will make me forget the miners." 

" Ah, Joe ! " she cried. " Don't let them win ye away 
from us ! We need ye so bad ! " 

" I'm going back home for a while," he answered, " but 
you can be sure that no matter what happens in my life, 
I'm going to fight for the working people. When the big 



strike comes, as we know it's coming in this coal-country, 
I'll be here to do my share." 

" Sure lad," she said, looking him bravely in the eye, 
"and good-bye to ye, Joe Smith." Her eyes did not 
waver; but Hal noted a catch in her voice, and he found 
himself with an impulse to take her in his arms. It was 
very puzzling. He knew he loved Jessie Arthur; he re- 
membered the question Mary had once asked him — could 
he be in love with two girls at the same time ? It was not 
in accord with any moral code that had been impressed 
upon him, but apparently he could ! 



 He went out to the street, where hie brother was 
pacing up and down in a ferment. The " hardware 
drummer" had made another effort to start a conversa- 
tion, and had been told to go to hell — no less ! 

"Well, are you through now?" Edward demanded, 
taking out his irritation on Hal. 

" Yes," replied the other. " I suppose so." He real- 
ised that Edward would not be concerned about Edstrom's 
broken arm. 

" Then, for God's sake, get some clothes on and let's 
have some food." 

" All right," said Hal. But his answer was listless, 
and the other looked at him sharply. Even by the moon- 
light Edward could see the lines in the face of his younger 
brother, and the hollows around his eyes. For the first 
time he realised how deeply these experiences were cut- 
ting into the boy's soul. " You poor kid ! " he exclaimed, 
with sudden feeling. But Hal did not answer; he did 
not want sympathy, he did not want anything! 

Edward made a gesture of despair. " God knows, I 
don't know what to do for you ! " 

They started back to the hotel, and on the way Edward 
cast about in his mind for a harmless subject of conver- 



 

sation. He mentioned that he had foreseen the shutting 
up of the stores, and had purchased an outfit for his 
brother. There was no need to thank him, he added 
grimly ; he had no intention of travelling to Western City 
in company with a hobo. 

So the young miner had a bath, the first real one in a 
long time. (Never again would it be possible for ladies 
to say in Hal Warner's presence that the poor might at 
least keep clean!) He had a shave; he trimmed his 
finger-nails, and brushed his hair, and dressed himself as 
a gentleman. In spite of himself he found his cheerful- 
ness partly restored. A strange and wonderful sensation 
— to be dressed once more as a gentleman. He thought 
of the saying of the old negro, who liked to stub his toe, 
because it felt so good when it stopped hurting ! 

They went out to find a restaurant, and on the way one 
last misadventure befell Edward. Hal saw an old miner 
walking past, and stopped with a cry : " Mike ! " He 
forgot all at once that he was a gentleman ; the old miner 
forgot it also. He stared for one bewildered moment, 
then he rushed at Hal and seized him in the hug of a 
mountain grizzly. 

" My buddy ! My buddy ! " he cried, and gave Hal a 
prodigious thump on the back. " By Judas ! " And he 
gave him a thump with the other hand. " Hey ! you old 
son-of-a-gun ! " And he gave him a hairy kiss ! 

But in the very midst of these raptures it dawned over 
him that there was something wrong about his buddy. 
He drew back, staring. "You got good clothes I You 
got rich, hey ? " 

Evidently the old fellow had heard no rumour concern- 
ing Hal's secret. "I've been doing pretty well," Hal 
said. 

" What you work at, hey ? " 

" I been working at a strike in North Valley." 

" What's that ? You make money working at strike ? " 



 

Hal laughed, but did not explain. " What you work- 
ing at?" 

" I work at strike too — all alone strike." 

" No job ? " 

"I work two days on railroad. Got busted track up 
there. Pay me two-twenty-five a day. Then no more 
job." 

" Have you tried the mines ? " 

" What ? Me ? They got me all right ! I go up to 
San Jose. Pit-boss say, * Get the hell out of here, you 
old groucher! You don't get no more jobs in this dis- 
trict !'" 

Hal looked Mike over, and saw that his dirty old face 
was drawn and white, belying the feeble cheerfulness of 
his words. " We're going to have something to eat," he 
said. " Won't you come with us ? " 

" Sure thing ! " said Mike, with alacrity. " I go easy 
on grub now." 

Hal introduced "Mr. Edward Warner," who said 
" How do you do ? " He accepted gingerly the calloused 
paw which the old Slovak held out to him, but he could 
not keep the look of irritation from his face. His pa- 
tience was utterly exhausted. He had hoped to find a 
decent restaurant and have some real food; but now, of 
course, he could not enjoy anything, with this old gobbler 
in front of him. 

They entered an all-night lunch-room, where Hal and 
Mike ordered cheese-sandwiches and milk, and Edward 
sat and wondered at his brother's ability to eat such food. 
Meantime the two cronies told each other their stories, 
and Old Mike slapped his knee and cried out with delight 
over Hal's exploits. " Oh, you buddy ! " he exclaimed ; 
then, to Edward, " Ain't he a daisy, hey ? " And he gave 
Edward a thump on the shoulder. " By Judas, they don't 
beat my buddy ! " 

Mike Sikoria had last been seen by Hal from the win- 



 

dow of the North Valley jail, when he had been distrib- 
uting the copies of Hal's signature, and Bud Adams had 
taken him in charge. The mine-guard had marched him 
into a shed in back of the power-house, where he had 
found Kauser and Kalovac, two other fellows who had 
been arrested while helping in the distribution. 

Mike detailed the experience with his usual animation. 
" i Hey, Mister Bud  I say, ' if you going to send me 
down canyon, I want to get my things.' i You go to hell 
for your things  says he. And then I say, i Mister Bud, 
I want to get my time.' And he says, i I give you plenty 
time right here ! ' And he punch me and throw me over. 
Then he grab me up again and pull me outside, and I see 
big automobile waiting, and I say, ' Holy Judas ! I get 
ride in automobile! Here I am, old fellow fifty-seven 
years old, never been in automobile ride all my days. I 
think always I die and never get in automobile ride ! ' 
We go down canyon, and I look round and see them moun- 
tains, and feel nice cool wind in my face, and I say, 
i Bully for you, Mister Bud, I don't never forget this 
automobile. I don't have such good time any day all my 
life.' And he say, i Shut your face, you old wop I ' Then 
we come out on prairie, we go up in Black Hills, and they 
stop, and say, 'Get out here, you sons o' guns.' And 
they leave us there all alone. They say, * You come back 
again, we catch you and we rip the guts out of you ! ' 
They go away fast, and we got to walk seven hours, us 
fellers, before we come to a house! But I don't mind 
that, I begged some grub, and then I got job mending 
track; only I don't find out if you get out of jail, and 
I think maybe I lose my buddy and never see him no 
more." 

Here the old man stopped, gazing affectionately at Hal. 
"I write you letter to North Valley, but I don't hear 
nothing, and I got to walk all the way on railroad track 
to look for you." 



 

How was it? Hal wondered. He had encountered 
naked horror in this coal-country — yet here he was, not 
entirely glad at the thought of leaving it ! He would miss 
Old Mike Sikoria, his hairy kiss and his grizzly-bear hug! 

He struck the old man dumb by pressing a twenty- 
dollar bill into his hand. Also he gave him the address 
of Edstrom and Mary, and a note to Johann Hartman, 
who might use him to work among the Slovaks who came 
down into the town. Hal explained that he had to go 
back to Western City that night, but that he would never 
forget his old friend, and would see that he had a good 
job. He was trying to figure out some occupation for the 
old man on his father's country-place. A pet grizzly ! 

Train-time came, and the long line of dark sleepers 
rolled in by the depot-platform. It was late — after mid- 
night ; but, nevertheless, there was Old Mike. He was in 
awe of Hal now, with his fine clothes and his twenty- 
dollar bills ; but, nevertheless, under stress of his emotion, 
he gave him one more hug, and one more hairy kiss. 
" Good-bye, my buddy ! " he cried. " You come back, my 
buddy ! I don't forget my buddy ! " And when the 
train began to move, he waved his ragged cap, and ran 
along the platform to get a last glimpse, to call a last 
farewell. When Hal turned into the car, it was with more 
than a trace of moisture in his eyes. 





From previous experiences the writer has learned that 
many people, reading a novel such as " King Coal," de- 
sire to be informed as to whether it is true to fact. They 
write to ask if the book is meant to be so taken ; they ask 
for evidence to convince themselves and others. Having 
answered thousands of such letters in the course of his 
life, it seems to the author the part of common-sense to 
answer some of them in advance. 

" King Coal " is a picture of the life of the workers in 
unorganised labour-camps in many parts of America. 
The writer has avoided naming a definite place, for the 
reason that such conditions are to be found as far apart 
as West Virginia, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and 
Colorado. Most of the details of his picture were gath- 
ered in the last-named state, which the writer visited on 
three occasions during and just after the great coal-strike 
of 1913-14. The book gives a true picture of conditions 
and events observed by him at this time. Practically all 
the characters are real persons, and every incident which 
has social significance is not merely a true incident, but a 
typical one. The life portrayed in " King Coal " is the 
life that is lived to-day by hundreds of thousands of men, 
women and children in this " land of the free." 

The reader who wishes evidence may be accommodated. 
There was never a strike more investigated than the Colo- 
rado coal-strike. The material about it in the writer's 
possession cannot be less than eight million words, the 
greater part of it sworn testimony taken under govern- 
ment supervision. There is, first, the report of the Con- 
gressional Committee, a government document of three 


thousand closely printed pages, about two million words ; 
an equal amount of testimony given before the U. S. Com- 
mission on Industrial Relations, also a government docu- 
ment; a special report on the Colorado strike, prepared 
for the same commission, a book of 189 pages, supporting 
every contention of this story; about four hundred thou- 
sand words of testimony given before a committee ap- 
pointed at the suggestion of the Governor of Colorado; 
a report made by the Rev. Henry A. Atkinson, who 
investigated the strike as representative of the Federal 
Council of the Churches of Christ in America, and of 
the Social Service Commission of the Congregational 
Churches; the report of an elaborate investigation by the 
Colorado state militia; the bulletins issued by both sides 
during the controversy; the testimony given at various 
coroners' inquests ; and, finally, articles by different writ- 
ers to be found in the files of Everybody's Magazine, the 
Metropolitan Magazine, the Survey, Harper's Weekly, 
and Collier's Weekly, all during the year 1914, 

The writer prepared a collection of extracts from these 
various sources, meaning to publish them in this place; 
but while the manuscript was in the hands of the publish- 
ers, there appeared one document, which, in the weight of 
its authority, seemed to discount all others. A decision 
was rendered by the Supreme Court of the State of Colo- 
rado, in a case which included the most fundamental of 
the many issues raised in " King Coal ' It is not often 
that the writer of a novel of contemporary life is ho fortu- 
nate as to have the truth of his work passed upon and 
established by the highest judicial tribunal of the com- 
munity! 

In the elections of November, 1914, in Huerfano 
County, Colorado, J. B. Farr, Republican candidate for 
re-election as sheriff, a person known throughout the coal- 
country as " the King of Huerfano County," was returned 
as elected by a majority of 329 votes. His rival, to be 



 

Democratic candidate, contested the election, alleging 
" malconduct, fraud and corruption." The district court 
found in Farr's favour, and the case was appealed on 
error to the Supreme Court of the State. On June 21st, 
1916, after Farr had served nearly the whole of his term 
of office, the Supreme Court handed down a decision 
which unseated him and the entire ticket elected with him, 
finding in favour of the opposition ticket in all cases and 
upon all grounds charged. 

The decision is long — about ten thousand words, and 
its legal technicalities would not interest the reader. It 
will suffice to reprint the essential paragraphs. The 
reader is asked to give these paragraphs careful study, 
considering, not merely the specific offence denounced by 
the court, but its wider implications. The offence was 
one so unprecedented that the justices of the court, men 
chosen for their learning in the history of offences, were 
moved to say: "We find no such example of fraud 
within the books, and must seek the letter and spirit of 
the law in a free government, as a scale in which to weigh 
such conduct." And let it be noted, this " crime without 
a name" was not a crime of passion, but of policy; it 
was a crime deliberately planned and carried out by profit- 
seeking corporations of enormous power. Let the reader 
imagine the psychology of the men of great wealth who 
ordered this crime, as a means of keeping and increasing 
their wealth ; let him realise what must be the attitude of 
such men to their helpless workers ; and then let him ask 
himself whether there is any act portrayed in " King 
Coal" which men of such character would shrink from 
ordering. 

The Court decision first gives an outline of the case, 
using for the most part the statements of the counsel for 
the defendant, Farr; so that for practical purposes the 
following may be taken as the coal companies' own ac- 
count of their domain : " Bound the shaft of each mine 




are clustered the tipple, the mine office, the shops, sheds 
and outbuildings; and huddled close by, within a stone's 
throw, cottages of the miners built on the land of, and 
owned by, the mining company. All the dwellers in the 
camp are employes of the mine. There is no other in- 
dustry. This is 'the camp  Of the eight ' closed 
camps' it appears that practically the same conditions 
existed in all of them, and those conditions were in gen- 
eral that members of the United Mine Workers of Amer- 
ica, their organisers or agitators, were prevented from 
coming into the camps, so far as it was possible to keep 
them out, and to this end guards were stationed about 
them. Of the eight ' closed camps ' one of them, ' Wal- 
sen,' was, and at the time of the trial still was, enclosed 
by a fence erected at the beginning of the strike in Octo- 
ber, 1913: Rouse and Cameron were partly, but never 
entirely, enclosed by fences. It is admitted that all per- 
sons entering these camps and precincts were required by 
the companies to have passes, and it is contended that this 
was an i industrial necessity.' "
