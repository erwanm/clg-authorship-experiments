No one could tell what Gianforte Campodonico thought of the matter. He
shut himself up obstinately and awaited events. It is not probable that
he felt any remorse for what he had done, or that he would have felt any
if he had left Ghisleri dead on the field, instead of with a bare chance
of life. He had taken the vengeance he had longed for and he was glad of
it, but the impression he had of the man was not the same which he had
been accustomed to for so many years. He, who generally reflected
little, asked himself whether he could have found the courage to bear
what Ghisleri had borne for the sake of the promise they had made
together, and which he had been the first to break. He was a brave man,
too, in his way, and it would not have been safe to predict that he
would fail at any given point if put to the test. But he was conscious
that, in the present case, Ghisleri had played the nobler part, and he
was manly enough to acknowledge the fact to himself, and to respect his
adversary as he had not done before. If he stayed at home and refused to
be seen in the world or even at his club immediately after the duel, it
was because he would not be thought willing to glory in his victory.

But, before many days were gone by, it became apparent, so far as the
world could judge, that Pietro Ghisleri would not die of the dangerous
wound he had received. It would have killed most men, the surgeon said,
but Ghisleri was not like other people. He, the doctor, had never seen a
stronger constitution, nor one so perfectly untainted by any hereditary
evil or weakness. Such blood was rare now, especially in the old
families, and such strength would have been rare in any age. He had no
longer any hesitation in saying that the patient had a very fair
prospect of recovery, and might possibly be as healthy as ever before
the end of the summer.

The Sister of Charity went about with Maddalena's bracelet in her
pocket, feeling very uncomfortable about it, since she had been quite
sure from the first that there was something very sinful in the whole
affair. But she was quite ready to fulfil her promise if Ghisleri showed
signs of departing this life, which he did not, however, either when he
first regained consciousness or later. So she, on her part, said
nothing, and waited for the day when she might deliver up the trinket to
the Mother Superior, to be sold for the poor, as Maddalena had directed.
In that, at least, there could be no harm, and she was very thankful
that she was not called upon to deliver the message to Ghisleri himself,
for that, she felt sure, would have been sinful, or something very like
it.

The surgeon was surprised by something else in the case. As a general
rule, when a man fights a desperate duel in the very middle of the
season, and especially such a man as he knew Ghisleri to be, and is
severely hurt, he finds himself cut off from society in the midst of
some chain of events in which the whole present interest of his life is
engaged. He is consequently disturbed in mind, impatient of confinement,
and feverishly anxious to get back to the world,--a state of temper by
no means conducive to convalescence. Ghisleri, on the contrary, seemed
to have forgotten to care for anything. No preoccupation appeared to
possess him; no desire to be back again in the throng made him restless.
He was perfectly calm and peaceful, always patient, and always resigned
to whatever treatment seemed necessary. The Sister wondered much that a
man of such marvellous gentleness and resignation could have found it in
him to commit mortal sin in fighting a duel, and, perhaps, far down in
her woman's heart, she did not wonder at all at what Maddalena had done
on that first morning. The surgeon said that Ghisleri's sweet temper had
much to do with his rapid recovery.

It need not be supposed from this that his character had undergone any
radical change, nor that he was turning, all at once, into the saint he
was never intended to be. It was very simple. The events of the night
preceding the duel had brought his life to a crisis which, once past,
had left little behind it to disturb him. First in his mind was the
consciousness that his love for Maddalena dell' Armi was gone for ever,
and that she herself expected no return of it. That alone was enough to
change his whole existence in the present, and in the immediate future.
Then, too, he felt that he had at least settled old scores with
Campodonico and had in a measure expiated one, at least, of his past
misdeeds, almost at the cost of his life. Morally speaking, too, he had
kept his oath to Bianca Corleone, for under the utmost provocation he
had refused to fight in the old quarrel, and even when driven to bay and
forced upon new ground by Campodonico's implacable hatred, he had stood
up to be killed without so much as firing at Bianca's brother. There
was a deep and real satisfaction in that, and he was perhaps too ill as
yet to torture himself by stigmatising it as a bit of vanity. The world
might think what it pleased. Maddalena might misjudge his motives, and
Gianforte might triumph in his victory--it all made no difference to
him. He was conscious that to the best of his ability he had acted
according to the dictates of true honour, as he understood it; and at
night he closed his eyes and fell peacefully asleep, and in the morning
he opened them quietly again upon the little world of his invalid's
surroundings.

He was not happy, however. What he felt, and what perhaps saved his
life, was a momentary absence of responsibility, an absolute certainty
that nothing more could be required of him, because, in the events in
which he had played a part, that part had been acted out to the very
end. He even went so far as to believe that, if he had died, it would
not have made any difference to any one, except that his death might
possibly have been an added satisfaction to Campodonico. He would have
left no sorrowing heart behind to mourn him, nor any gap in any circle
which another man could not fill up. Herbert Arden, the only friend who
would have really regretted him, was already dead, and there was no one
else who stood to him in any relation of acquaintance at all so close as
to be called friendship. All this contributed materially to his peace of
mind, though in one respect he was mistaken. There was one person who
loved him still, for himself, though she knew well enough that his love
for her was dead.

And it was of her, though he was mistaken about her, that he thought the
most during the long hours when he lay there quietly watching the
sunbeams stealing across the room when it was fine, or listening to the
raindrops pattering against the windows when the weather was stormy. In
her was centred the great present regret of his life, and for her sake
he felt the most sincere remorse. He asked himself, as she had asked
him, what was to become of her, now that he had left her. The fact that
she had been really the one to speak the word and cause the first break
did not change the truth in the least. It had been his fault from the
first to the last. He had not broken her heart, perhaps, because hearts
are not now-a-days easily broken, if, indeed, they ever really were; but
he had ruined her existence wantonly, uselessly, on the plea of a love
neither pure nor lasting, and he fully realised what he had done. What
chance had she ever had against him--she, young, inexperienced,
trusting, wretchedly unhappy with a husband who had despised and trodden
out the simple, girlish love she had offered--what chance had she
against Pietro Ghisleri, the hardened, cool-headed man of the world,
whose only weakness was that he sometimes believed himself sincere, as
he had with her? He was not happy as he thought of it all. There had
been little manliness in what he had done, and not much of the honour
which he called his last shred of morality. And yet, in the world in
which he had his being, few men would blame him, and none, perhaps,
venture to condemn him. But that consideration did not cross his mind.
He was willing to bear both condemnation and blame, and he heaped both
upon himself in a plentiful measure.

Nevertheless, he was conscious of being surprised at the calmness of his
own repentance, as he called it rather contemptuously, and he wished
himself, as usual, quite different from what he was. And yet he had not
forgotten the semi-theatrical resolution to change his life, which he
had made on the night before the duel, still less had he any intention
of breaking it. He had always laughed at men and women who made sudden
and important resolutions under the influence of emotion, and, on the
whole, he had never seen any reason for looking upon such gratuitous
promises as valid, unless there had been witnesses to them, and human
vanity afterwards came into play. But now, in his own case, he meant to
try the experiment. It made no difference whether he were vain about it
or not, if he succeeded, nor, if he failed, whether he scorned his own
weakness a little more than before. No one would ever know, and since by
Laura Arden's rigid standard of right and wrong the end to be gained
belonged distinctly to the right, he would be in a measure following her
advice in regard to life in general. Deeper down in his nature, too,
there lay another thought which he would not now evoke, lest he should
himself condemn it as sentimental. That secret promise had been honestly
intended, and had been addressed to the memory of one who, though long
dead, still had a stronger influence over him than any one now living.
He hardly dared to acknowledge the truth of this and the real meaning of
what he had done, lest, if he failed hereafter, he should have to accuse
himself of faithlessness towards the one woman to whom he had been
really true, and whom, if she had lived, he would have loved till the
end, in spite of obstacles, in spite of mankind, in spite, he added
defiantly, of Heaven itself. All this he tried to keep out of sight,
while firmly resolving, in his own cynical way, to try the experiment of
goodness for once, and to do no more harm in the world if he could help
it.

He thought of Laura Arden, too, in his long convalescence, and her image
was always pleasant to his inner vision, as the impression she had
produced on him was soothing to recall. There were times when her holy
eyes seemed to gaze at him out of the darker corners of the room, and he
tried often to bring back her whole presence. The pleasure such useless
feats of imagination gave him was artistic if it was anything, because
he admired her beauty and had always delighted in it. He tried to fancy
what she was doing, on certain days when he thought more of her than
usual, and to follow her life a little, always trying in a vague way to
fathom the secret of the character that was so wonderful in his
estimation. And always, when he had been thinking of her, he came back
to the contemplation of his own immediate interests with a renewed calm
and with a peaceful sense that there might yet be better days in store
for him--possibly days in which he should himself be better than he had
been heretofore.

How the world would have jeered, could it have suspected that Pietro
Ghisleri was thinking almost seriously of such a very commonplace
subject as moral goodness, as he lay on his back, day after day, in the
quiet of his room. How gladly would Adele Savelli have changed places
with the man who, as she thought, for the sake of a bit of gossip she
had invented out of spite, had nearly lost his life!




CHAPTER XV.


When Ghisleri was at last able to go out of the house, his first visit
was to Maddalena dell' Armi. He had written a line to say that he was
coming, and she expected him. The meeting was a strange one, for both
felt at first the constraint of their mutual position. Ghisleri looked
at her face, which had been so hard when he had last seen it, and he saw
that it had softened. There were no signs of suffering, however, and her
expression was almost as placid as his own. He raised her hand to his
lips and sat down opposite to her. Then the light fell on his face and
she saw how changed he was. She remembered how he had looked when she
had seen him after he was wounded, and she saw that he was almost as
pale now as then, and that he was thin almost to emaciation.

"Are you really growing strong again?" she asked in a tone of anxiety.

"Yes, indeed," he answered with a smile. "I feel as though I were quite
well--a little gaunt and weak, perhaps, but that will soon pass. And
you--how have you spent your time in all these weeks since I last saw
you?"

"Very much as usual," replied Maddalena, and suddenly a weary look came
into her eyes. "If you care to know--as long as you were really in
danger I did not go out. Then I went everywhere again, and tried to
amuse myself."

"Did you succeed?" asked Ghisleri, trying hard to speak cheerfully.
There had been something hopeless in Maddalena's tone which shocked him
and pained him.

"More or less. Why do you ask me that?"

"Because I am interested."

"Do you care for me in the least--in any way?" she asked abruptly.

"You know that I do--"

"How should I know it?"

Ghisleri did not reply at once, for the question was not easily
answered. Maddalena waited in silence until he should speak.

"Perhaps you are right," he said at last. "You have no means of knowing
it, and I have no means of proving it. Dearest lady, since we have both
changed so much, do you not think you could believe a little in my
friendship?"

"We ought to be friends--you should be my best friend."

"I mean to be, if you will let me."

A long silence followed. Maddalena sat quite still, leaning back in a
corner of the sofa and looking at a picture on the opposite wall.
Ghisleri sat upright on a chair at a little distance from her.

"You say that you will be my friend, if I will let you," she said
slowly, after several minutes. "Even if you could imagine that I could
not wish it, you ought to be my best friend just the same. If I made you
suffer every hour of the day as I did on that last night, you ought to
bear it, and never have one unkind thought of me. No; do not answer me
yet: I have much more to say. You know that I have always told you just
what I have felt, when I have told you anything about myself. I was
very unhappy when we met at that ball--or, rather, when we parted--so
unhappy that I hardly knew what I said. I ought to have waited and
thought before I spoke. If I could have guessed that you were to be
wounded--well, it is of no use now. I am very, very fond of you. In
spite of everything, if you felt the least love for me still, however
little, I would say, 'Let us be as we were, as long as it can last.' As
it is--"

She paused and looked at him. He knew what she meant. If there were a
spark of love, she would forget everything and take him back on any
terms. For a moment the old struggle was violently resumed in his heart.
Ought he not, for her sake, to pretend love, and to live out his life as
best he could in the letter of devotion if not in the true spirit of
love? Or would not such an attempt necessarily be a failure, and bring
her more and more unhappiness with each month and year? He only
hesitated for an instant while she paused; then he determined to say
nothing. That was really the turning-point in Pietro Ghisleri's life.

"As it is," continued Maddalena, a little unsteadily, but with a brave
effort, "nothing but friendship is possible. Let it at least be a true
and honest friendship which neither of us need be ashamed of. Let all
the world see it. Go your way, and I will go mine, so far as the rest is
concerned. If you love Lady Herbert, marry her, if she will have you,
when her mourning is over."

"I do not love Lady Herbert at all," said Ghisleri with perfect truth.

"Well--if you should, or any other woman. Let the world say what it
will, it cannot invent anything worse than it has said of me already.
You owe me nothing--nothing but that,--to be a true friend to me always,
as I will be to you as long as I live."

She put out her hand, and he took it and pressed it. As she felt his,
the bright tears started to her eyes.

"What is it?" he asked tenderly, bending towards her as he spoke.

"Nothing," she answered hastily. "Your hand is so thin--how foolish of
me! I suppose you will grow to be as strong as ever?"

He saw how she still loved him, in spite of all. It was not too late
even now to renew the comedy, but his resolution had grown strong and
unalterable in a few moments.

"You are much too good to me," he said softly. "I have not deserved
it--but I will try to."

"Do not let us speak of all this any more for the present," she replied.
"Since we are friends, let us talk of other things, as friends do."

It was not easy, but Ghisleri did his best, feeling that the effort must
be made sooner or later and had therefore best be made at once. He kept
up the conversation for nearly half an hour, and then rose to go.

"Are you not very tired?" asked Maddalena, anxiously.

"Not at all. I am much stronger than I look."

"Indeed I hope you are!" she answered, looking at him sadly. "Good-bye.
Come soon again."

"Yes, I will come very soon."

Ghisleri went out and had himself driven about the city for an hour in
the bright spring weather. It was all new to him now, and he looked at
people and things with a sort of interest he had long forgotten to feel.
A few of his acquaintances recognised him at once, and waved their hats
to him if they chanced to be men, or made pretty gestures with their
hands if they were women. But the greater number did not know him at
first, and stared after the death-like face and the gaunt figure wrapped
in a fur coat that had grown far too wide.

He was very glad that the first meeting with Maddalena was over, for he
had looked forward to it with considerable anxiety. Something like what
had actually been said about friendship had been inevitable, as he now
saw, but he had not realised how much he was still loved, nor that
Maddalena could so far humiliate herself as to show that she cared for
him still, and to offer a renewal of their old relations. Even now,
could he have seen her pale and tear-stained face as she sat motionless
in the place where he had left her, he might possibly have been weak
enough to yield, strong as his determination was not to do so. But that
sight was spared him, and he was glad that he had held his peace when
she had paused to give him an opportunity of speaking. It was far better
so. To act a miserable play with her, no matter from what so-called
honourable motive of consideration, would be to make her life far more
unhappy than it would ultimately be if she knew the truth. He was
satisfied with what he had done, therefore, when he went back to his
rooms and lay down to rest after the fatigue of his first day out. But
the meeting had left a very sad and painful impression, and all that he
felt of remorse and regret for what he had done was doubled now. He
hated to think that by his fault she was cast upon the world, with
little left to save her, "trying to amuse herself," as she had said, and
he wondered at her gentleness and kindness to himself, so different from
her behaviour at their last meeting. That, at least, comforted him. In a
woman who could thus forgive there must be depths of goodness which
would ultimately come to the surface. He remembered how often he had
thought her hard, unjust, unkind, and, above all, unbelieving, in the
days that succeeded the first outbursts of unreasoning love, and how,
even while loving her, he had not always found it easy not to judge her
harshly. She was very different now. Possibly, since she felt that she
had lost her old power over him, she would be less impatient with him
when she did not understand him, and when he displeased her. Come what
might, treat him as she would, he owed her faithful allegiance and
service--and those at least he could give. He could never atone to her,
but in the changing scenes of the world he might, by devoting to her
interest all the skill and tact he possessed, make her life happier and
easier.

Before night he received a note from Laura Arden. She wrote that she had
seen him driving, though he had not seen her pass, as he had been
looking in the opposite direction. If he was able to bear the fatigue of
making a call, she begged that he would come to her at any hour he chose
to name, as she wished to speak to him. He answered at once that he
would be at her house on the following day at three o'clock.

He knew very well what she wanted, and why she did not wait until he
came of his own accord. She meant to speak to him of the duel, and her
questions would be hard to answer, since she was probably in ignorance
of many details of his former life, familiar enough to people of his own
age. He knew, of course, that the world said he had really fought on her
account, and that he could never prevail upon the world to think
otherwise. But he was very anxious that Laura herself should know the
truth. She might forgive him for having let people believe that she had
been concerned in the matter rather than Maddalena dell' Armi, out of
womanly consideration for the latter, but she would assuredly not pardon
him if she continued to suppose that he had made her the subject of
useless gossip.

The situation was not an easy one.

At the appointed hour he entered her drawing-room. He was almost
startled by her beauty when he first saw her standing opposite to him.
She had developed in every way during the many weeks since he had seen
her. The perfectly calm and regular life she led had produced its
inevitable good effect. She, on her part, was almost as much shocked by
his looks as Maddalena had been.

"Have I not asked too much of you?" she inquired, pushing forward a
comfortable chair for him, and arranging a cushion in it.

"Not at all. Thanks," he added, as he sat down, "you are very good, but
pray do not imagine that I am an invalid."

"I only saw you in the street," she said, almost apologetically. "I did
not realise how desperately ill you still looked. Please forgive me."

"But I should have come to-day or to-morrow in any case," protested
Ghisleri. "After what has happened--yes, I think I know why you sent for
me. You have heard what every one is saying. The men who came to see me
before I could go out told me all about it. I knew beforehand that it
would turn out as it has, though we gave our seconds another excuse, as
you have probably also heard, and which, if the truth were known, was
much nearer to betraying the cause of the quarrel than any one supposed.
