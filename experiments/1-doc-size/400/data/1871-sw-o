" Nothing, much. Only trying to put things 
a little in order." 

" You" said Mrs. Laval. " Leave that, my 
darling. You cannot. There will be somebody to do it by and by. But I wish I had 
somebody here now, to make gruel, or porridge, or something, for those poor people. 
They are without any comforts." 

Mrs. Laval looked puzzled. 

" Are they better ? " Matilda asked. 

" Two of them are sick ; indeed they are all 
sick, more or less ; but the men are really ill, 
I think." 

"If I had some meal, I could make gruel," 
said Matilda. " I know how. I have made 
it for I have made it at home, often." 
. " Could you ? " said Mrs. Laval. " There 
must be some meal here somewhere." 



 

She went down to search for it. But it 
was found presently that she did not know 
meal when she saw it; and Matilda's help 
was needed to decide which barrel held the 
article. 

" I am a useless creature," Mrs. Laval said, 
as she watched Matilda getting some meal 
out. " If you can manage that, darling, I
will be forever obliged to you, and so will 
those poor people. It is really good to know 
how to do things. Why, what have you done 
with all the dishes and irons that were standing about here ? You have got the place in 
order, I declare ! What have you done with 
them, dear?" 

" They are put away. Shall I put on a 
pot and boil some potatoes, Mrs. Laval? I 
can ; and there is a great piece of cold beef 
in the pantry." " 

" Boil potatoes ? no, indeed ! " said Mrs. 
Laval. " Norton will get us some oysters, 
and some bread and some cake at the baker's. 
No, dear, do not touch the horrid things ; keep 



 

your hands away from them. "We'll fast, for 
a day or two, and enjoy eating all the better 
afterwards." 

Matilda made her gruel, nicely ; and Mrs. 
Laval carried it herself down to the farm 
house. She came back looking troubled. 
They could not touch it, she said, after all ; 
not one of them but the young girl ; they 
were really a sick house down there ; and she 
would go to New York and get help tomorrow. So by the early morning train she 
went. 

It was rather a day of amusement to the 
two children left alone at home. They had a 
great sense of importance upon them, and 
some sense of business. Matilda at least 
found a good deal for herself to do, upstairs 
and downstairs ; then she and Norton sat 
down on the verandah in the soft October 
light, and consulted over all the details of the 
tulip and hyacinth beds. 

" Fifty dollars ! " said Matilda at last 

" Yes? " said Norton. Well? " 





"Nothing. Only did you ever think, 
Norton, how many other things one could do 
with fifty dollars ? I wonder if it is right to 
spend so much just on a flower bed?" 

" It isn't. It's on two flower beds," said 
Norton. 

""Well, on two. It is the same thing." 

" That's a very loose way of talking," said 
Norton. " Two and one are not at all the 
same thing. They are three." 

" O Norton ! but you are twisting things 
all round, now. I didn't say anything ridiculous." 

" I am not so sure of that. Pink, one would 
never spend money any way, if one stopped 
because one could spend it some other 
way." 

"But it ought to be always the best 
way." 

"You can't tell what the best way is," said 
Norton. " I can't think of anything so good 
to do with this fifty dollars, as to make those 
two beds of bulbous roots.," 



 

Matilda sat thinking, not convinced, but 
longing very much to see the hyacinths and 
tulips, when a voice at the glass door behind 
her made her start. It was the doctor. 

" Good morning. Is nobody at home ? " 

" Nobody but us," said Norton. 

" Mrs. Laval gone out, eh ? " 

" Gone to New York, sir." 

"To New York, eh? Ah! Well! Unfortunate ! " 

" What shall I tell her, sir, when she comes 
back ? " 

" Is there anybody in the house that can 
make beef tea ? " 

" No, sir," said Norton. 

" If you will tell me how, Dr. Bird, I will 
have some," Matilda said. 

" You, eh ? Well, you do know something 
more than most girls. You can remember 
and follow directions, if I tell you, eh ? " 

" Yes, sir. I think I can." 

" Then I'll tell you. You take a piece of 
juicy beef he can see to that juicy beef; 




not a poor cut, mind, nor fat ; mustn't be any 
fat; and you cut it into dice ; and when you 
have cut it all up fine, you put it in a bottle 
and cork it up. Understand ? " 

" Yes, sir. But I don't know what dice 
are." 

" Don't, eh ? well, little bits as big as the 
end of my finger, will do as well as dice. 
Then when you have got your bottle corked, 
set it in a pot of water, and put the pot on 
the fire, and let it boil, till the juice of the 
beef comes out. Then strain that juice. 
That's beef tea." 

" I mustn't put any water in with the beef, 
sir? in the bottle?" 

" Not a drop. Keep the water all in the 
pot." 

" "Who is to have the beef tea, doctor, when 
it is made?" 

" Those two Frenchmen at the farmhouse. 
I told the women. They ought to have it 
now. And a nurse too ; the women are sick 
themselves." 



 

Dr. Bird went his way, and Matilda persuaded Norton to go at once in quest of 
some juicy beef. It would be a difficult job, 
he said, for the butchers' shops were shut up; 
but he would go and try. While he was 
gone, Matilda amused herself with getting a 
dinner for him and herself down in the 
kitchen ; and there, when he came back, the 
two went, to eat their dinner and to set 
the beef tea a going. They had rather a 
jolly time of it, to tell the truth ; and were so 
very social and discussed so many things 
besides their beef and bread, that the beef 
tea was ready to strain by the time Matilda 
had cleared the things away. And then she 
and Norton went down to the farmhouse to 
carry it. 

They could get nobody to come to the 
door, so they opened it for themselves. It 
was a sad house to see. In two rooms all 
the family were gathered ; the men lying on 
beds in the inner room, one woman on the 
floor of the other, and one on a cot. All sick. 



 

The girl alone held her head up ; and she 
complained it was hard to do even that. 
Matilda and Norton went from one room to 
another. The men lay like logs, stupid with 
fever ; one of the women was light-headed ; 
not any of them would touch what Matilda 
had brought. The poor girl who was still on 
her feet was crying. There was no fire, no 
friend ; no comfort or help of any sort. Norton and his little companion made the rounds 
helplessly, and then went out to consult together. 

" Norton, they are dreadfully sick," whis 
pered Matilda. " I know they are." 

" I guess you are right," said Norton. " But 
you and I can't do anything." 

" I can," said Matilda. " I can give them 
water, and I can give them beef tea. And 
you, Norton, I will tell you what you can do. 
Go for Miss Redwood." 

" Miss Redwood ? who's she ? " 

" Don't you remember ? Mr. Richmond's 
housekeeper. She'll come, I know." 



 

" She'll be very good if she does," said 
Norton. " But I'll tell her you said so. Do 
you think she would come ? " 

" I'm certain of it" 




CHAPTER XL 

NORTON made his way to the brown 
door of the parsonage, and knocked 
but the person that opened it was the minister himself. Norton was a little confused 
now, remembering what his errand meant 
there. 

"Norton Laval, isn't it?" said Mr. Rich 
mond. " You are very welcome, Norton, at 
my house. Will you come in ? " 

" No, sir. If you please " 

"What is it? Something you would 
rather say to me here ? " 

" No, sir. I was coming " 

"To see me, I hope?" 

" No, sir," said Norton, growing desperate 
and colouring, which he was very unapr, to 
do. " If you please, Mr. Richmond, I was 



 

sent to speak to I forget what her name is 
the woman who lives here." 

" Miss Redwood ? " 

" Yes, sir." 

" Who sent you ? " 

" Matilda Englefield." 

" Did she ! Pray why did not Matilda 
come with you ? " 

" She could not, sir ; she was very busy. 
She asked me to come." 

" You can see Miss Redwood," said Mr. 
Richmond smiling. " I believe she is always 
ready to receive visiters ; at least I never saw 
a time when she was not. You have only to 
walk right in and knock at her door there. 
When are you coming to see me, Norton? 
You and I ought to be better friends." 

"I don't know, sir," said Norton. "I 
would not intrude." 

" Ask your friend Matilda if I do not like 
such intrusions. I shall have to invite you 
specially, I see. Well, go in and find Miss 
Redwood. I will not detain you now." 



 

Norton went in, glad to be released, for he 
did not exactly want to tell his errand to the 
minister; knocked at the kitchen door and 
was bade to enter. It was full, the kitchen 
was, of the sweet smell of baking bread ; and 
Miss Redwood was busily peering into her 
stove oven. 

" Who's there ? " she asked, too much 
engaged in turning her loaves to give her 
eyes to anything else, even a visiter. Norton 
told his name, and waited till the oven doors 
shut to with a clang; and then Miss Red 
wood, very pink in the face, rose up to look 
at him. 

" I've seen you before," was her remark. 

" Yes. I brought Matilda Englefield here 
one day," Norton answered. 

" Hm. I thought she brought you. What 
brings you now?" 

" Matilda wanted me to come with a mes 
sage to you." 

" Well you can sit down and tell it, if 
you're a mind to. Why didn't the child 




 

come herself? that's the first idee that comes 
to me." 

" She is busy trying to nurse some sick 
folks, and they are more than she can man 
age ; and she wants your help. At least she 
sent me to ask you if you wouldn't come." 

"Who's sick?" 

" Some people just come from Switzerland 
to be my mother's servants." 

" Switzerland," repeated Miss Redwood. 
" I have heard o' Switzerland, more than 
once in my life. I should like to know 
whereabouts it is. I never knew any one 
yet that could tell me." 

" Mr. Richmond knows, I suppose," said 
Norton. 

" I suppose he knows Greek," said Miss 
Redwood, " and ever so many other queer 
tongues too, I've no doubt ; but I should like 
to see myself askin' him to learn me. No, I
mean, as I never knew nobody that I'd ask. 
La! there's folks enough that knows. Only I 
never had no chances for them things." 



 

" I could shew you where Switzerland is, 
if you had a map," said Norton. 

" I guess I know as much as that myself,"
