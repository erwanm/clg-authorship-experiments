wonder that Lloyd Wentworth married her ; he feels cer- 
tain there will be more than one heart-ache about her 
before the gold fades from her hair. 

" My poor child ! Will you look upon me as a father? 
I have girls of my own ; and if one of them stood just 
where you do, in such a thorny path, heaven knows I 
should be more than grateful to the one who would be- 
friend her. Tell me all the trouble." 

She is weeping softly now, though she tries hard to 
stifle the sighs that rend her very soul. The long lashes 
glitter with tears like points of dew. He lets her weep 
out that burst of sorrow. 

''You will think me very weak," she begins. "I 
want to tell you just what has happened, and I want to 
know what any one can do." 

He leads her to the sofa, and then seats himself beside 
her. The little hands are folded in her lap ; they look 
pearl-tipped on her black dress. There is such an ex- 
ceeding daintiness about her, that it invests her with 
a sort of sanctity. 

''Has any one threatened you? " There is an ominous 
look in his eye, as if it would not be best for the one who 
endeavored it. " You know I told you no one outside of 
yourself could break the will, or attempt it." 

" Could I be placed under any restraint? " she asks, in 
a soft breath ; but there is an unconf essed terror in her 
eyes, — the terror that has more than once to-day struck a 
chill to her very soul. 

'' You do not surely mean that anybody — " Then he 
laughs, — not exactly a mirthful sound, — rather contemp- 
tuous, indeed. 

"Could I be held as incapable of caring for my house 
or my child, or deciding what I should do ? " 

There is a little fine pride in her voice. 

''Not unless you should show some signs of mental 



 



 



 

aberration." He studies the sweet face that is raised 
for his examination. There is a peculiar strength in it, 
the latent strength that is forced to the surface when the 
hour of need comes, but can never show itself in any 
blatant force. She is one who should be taken care of 
and shielded in some strong man's love. Thorns will go 
deep into her tender soul. 

" No," he rejoins, decisively, after a moment's thought. 
" Do not allow yourself any uneasiness ; I am here to 
fight for you. I don't look like a man who can be easily 
overcome, do I ? " 

He laughs genially. He wants to break her tense mood, 
to restore something like girlish buoyancy, if, haply, it 
may not be quite crushed by her sorrows. 

" I should like to see your little babe," he begins, in a 
tone of friendly interest, — '' Lloyd Wentworth's son, who 
has such a fair heritage awaiting him." 

Doris sighs as she rings the bell and summons Marie. 
Master Lloyd has just awakened from his nap, and has 
the celestial rosiness of good-humored babies at this stage. 
He is indeed a very fair specimen of babyhood, consider- 
ing the many changes that have already come to him, and 
he always awakes in a maze of delight, if he does not go 
to sleep in one. Certainly he has not inherited this robust 
appearance from either parent ; though his father, the 
judge remembers, caused no anxiety until after his first 
long illness. The child has large brown eyes and a fine 
brow ; the rest of the features have the uncertainty of 
very early life ; but for a child not quite three months old, 
he is a sufficiently healthy specimen for hope to build 
upon ; and he praises him generously, as the baby stares 
with wondering eyes. 

" Do you think your relatives would grant me an inter- 
view?" he asks, when the baby has ended his visit. ''I 
am sorry they chanced to fall into the hands of Mr. 
Matthewson, and it seems as if we might come to an 



 



 



 

anderstanding on so simple a matter. They can do 
nothing, so long as you are satisfied ; I doubt if much 
could be done in any event." 

Doris prefers to summon them herself, and taps lightly 
at their door, explaining her errand. 

Anson Gilbert looks up contemptuously. 

" I shall see him on my own account and at my own 
convenience," he answers, with what he intends for severe 
dignity. 

Doris glances inquiringly at her aunt. 

" I surely haven't anything to say to your Judge Min- 
turn," is her lofty answer. 

" I shall offer the will for probaJ;e to-morrow," that 
gentleman says, as he rises to depart. " Basil Went- 
worth has been away, or I should have done it before. 
He, of course, has some interest in it." 

" Can you keep him as guardian for the baby?" she 
inquires, timidly. 

" Well, I shall make a big effort in that direction. You 
must not mind if the Wentworths are a little distant at 
first. It is a great change for them. I have set my heart 
on it all coming out right in the end." And there is 
strength and encouragement in his tone. 

" Oh, I hope it will ! I hope it will ! " Doris Went- 
worth replies, in a manner that is really impassioned. 

''You will come to me with every little trouble," he 
continues, confidently. " You have no brother or father, 
and you are so young to have this great weight on your 
shoulders." 

She looks up at him through tears, and her little hands 
have a clinging clasp. She is too timid and too sore at 
heart to know how important this, her first victory really 
is, but it is so good to have one friend. 

For the rest, the day is very quiet. The Gilberts make 
her feel as if she was indeed a thankless being, but her 
sense of right upholds her. She can see their side, unjust 



 



 



 

as it is ; she can also understand the Wentworth view ; 
and theirs, she feels, has more claim to sympathy. 

Yet it must be confessed, as Doris wanders about the 
beautiful old house, and finds nooks and corners that 
Lloyd has described in stray reminiscences, an intense 
affection springs up, curiously free from jealousy. Here 
was Ms room ; here they all came to comfort him through 
weary days and nights, — the beautiful Agatha, the pas- 
sionate Olive, the gay Louise. Graham, it seems, has not 
made so deep an impression, but Basil — it would be sac- 
rilege to enter his room, and she passes the door with a 
sigh. 

That evening she reads again the " prayer for a person 
in affliction." It is not now for the sick young man in 
the little inn at Novara, but her own self, whose heart is 
heavy with many sorrows, who has been appointed to walk 
in a path that is present martyrdom. 



 



 



CHAPTER XI. 

BASIL. 

The drawing-room in Larch Avenue is small by com- 
parison with that at the Elms, but it is exquisitely 
arranged: so with all the house. The family has 
shrunken as well. Mrs. Stirling has been abroad for 
three months. Graham has a position in a banking house, 
secured by his brother's exertions, since he has evinced 
no desire for professional life, and can, if he chooses, 
spend his Sundays with them. Louise has gone with a 
young party, properly matronized, to Lake George. Olive 
is still confined to her room, and her illness, though not 
severe now, has some alarming brain symptoms. Mrs. 
Wentworth is restless and unhappy. A whirlwind seems 
to have torn them all up by the roots and scattered them 
far and wide. How can she help hating the hand that 
has wrought this devastation ? 

Basil enters the room. It is not quite dark enough for 
lamps, and sufficiently light for his mother to see his worn 
and haggard face. For Basil Wentworth has been doing 
some hard fighting with foes within and without. He will 
conquer them in but one way, and he means to be vic- 
torious. 

'' I have decided," he says to his mother, " I shall 
accept Judge Minturn's offer. It will give me position 
immediately, and you need one son at home. And I shall 
address myself to the business of making a fortune. I 
have hitherto despised mere money-getting, and it is dis- 
tasteful to me now, but one must do something with his 
life." 



 



 



 

There is a dreary hardness in the tone. The rich, mel- 
low content has gone out of it, and there has been an 
infinitely greater loss to his soul. He has been struck a 
hard blow ; he cannot strike back, but he will make blows 
tell somewhere. 

" My poor boy ! " The mother presses his hand sym- 
pathetically. ''Yes, that is the best, and you have been 
fortunate with Graham." 

''He should have gone to business before. The disci- 
pline will come rather hard now." 

"Well, it IS a comfort that Agatha is so prosperously 
married. Louise can find a mate easily when her time of 
loving comes ; but to a refined and intellectual woman, with 
a nervous, delicate temperament and so much pride, the 
alteration in our fortunes would have proved bitter 
indeed." 

It has not been such an utter change to the Went- 
worths. They will keep their position, their friends, and 
they have the sympathy of the "best" people in West- 
water. There will be no occasion for such large and 
elegant receiving, since the "queen of the goodly com- 
panie " has been transplanted to Stirling House. 

Basil is thankful now that Agatha has married so well. 

"You will find matters in a strange mess at Judge 
Minturn's," his mother continues. " Mrs. Wentworth," 
with a peculiarly scornful intonation, " backed by her aunt 
and uncle, mean to contest the will." 

" Contest it ! " in eui-prise. 

" Yes ; Matthewson has the case already. The point 
at issue, I believe, is the disposal of the Elms if the child 
should die. If there were no will, the mother would 
inherit from the child." 

" Yes," Basil replies. 

" And there is some question about her dower, — a weak 
place, I believe, that shows a loophole. Of course, they 
are the kind of people to take advantage of it." 



 



 



 

Basil begins to pace the room. He has said to himself 
a hundred times that the dear old home was gone without 
perad venture, that the child was sure to live, and that he 
had given up any lingering hope. But he feels now as if 
he could fight, not for himself, not for the possible gain, 
but simply to have Lloyd's wishes respected. 

"You are appointed the child's guardian. I did not 
tell you that in my letter." 

Basil stops short. There is a flush of indignation on 
his cheek, an angry light in his eye. 

"Did he dare— " 

' ' Hush, my dear ! Do not blame poor Lloyd too severely. 
Remember, he was away there among grasping strangers 
I have no doubt but that he understood them too well, and 
too late learned what a set of adventuring sharpers they 
were. The Gilberts, it seems, have been given no position 
of trust ; and I dare say Mrs. Lloyd is very angry at the 
disrespect shown to her relatives." 

"Guardian!" he repeats, with haughty scorn. "A 
lovely position truly ! Lloyd must have lost his senses 
quite, to put me in as a marplot, and a target for their 
insults. I shall refuse everything ; I shall wash my hands 
of the whole matter. Let it all go ! " 

If he has felt hurt before, it is now a passion of unrea- 
soning, vehement anger. He despises Lloyd in his grave, 
for his weakness, his injustice, as he terms it, and his 
miserable attempt to gloss it over by a small show of 
respect. Better a hundred times that he had not done 
that! 

"But — it may be wiser," his mother answers, rather 
doubtfully. 

" It will not be at all. I shall decline it the first thing. 
It is a positive insult." 

" Judge Minturn and you are executors. He has been 
waiting for you to come back, and what is it — qualify, or 
some such word." 



 



 



 

'' He can do as he likes ; I will not have part nor ^ot 
in the matter. I have nothing to do with the Elms now 
or at any future time. Lloyd chose to gratify himself, 
and I choose that it shall not cost me more than it has 
done already ; which, Heaven knows, is enough ! To be so 
deceived when one has loved ! But I might have known 
better than to pin my faith to such a weak, unstable reed. 
I have just my own life before me, to make or mar." 
Long afterward he is destined to remember this sentence, 
and it burns in his soul like fire. " I shall be your son 
always," softening a little ; "Louise will marry and go out 
of my life, as Agatha has done ; that is right enough ; so 
there will be nothing left but this chase after fortune, and 
that I despise." 

His tone betrays it. His mother is really troubled at 
this unwonted vehemence, at the change that has come 
over him. He is stern to a resentful hardness. 

"I ought to see Judge Minturn this very night," he 
says, suddenly. '' Yes, I had better go."
