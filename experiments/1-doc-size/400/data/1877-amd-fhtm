The engagement did get talked of, though we were very 
quiet about it. Miss Hudson considered Mr. Ross a 
foolish man to marry such a very young girl ; and Theo 
Durant, she had heard, was a good deal of a flii’t. She 
hoped they would be happy ; but there was so much dif- 
ference in their ages ! 

Yet there were many pleasant episodes in the calls, and 
merry confusion, and planning. Theo kept very gay, and 
was on her good beha\dor, she said. Certainly she was 
devoted to Mr. Ross, who now came in nearly every even- 
ing. Was she happ}-? 

If father could be in uncle Robert’s place. I used to 
think of it so often ! If Theo and I could have the leis- 
ure, the advantages of society and dressing, and five in 





that beautiful palace ; if we could draw around us a 
circle of cultivated and refined people, and, after having 
enjoyed a delightful youth, choose, or be chosen by, the 
one man whose soul might overshadow and fill ours with 
that perfect love casting out all fear ; if one need not 
study what would be best, need not balance a dependence 
on one side or the other with the feeling of urgency, but 
enter that large, serene, hopeful life, calm with the thought 
of an heavenly awaiting ! 

Ah, if they could but see, — these rich, fortunate souls, 
— learn to care less for the glitter or the hot race of out- 
stripping their neighbors ! That many of them are not 
happy, I know. But do we blame the beautiful garden 
and the tree of knowledge, because Eve sinned? 

We could have none of these advantages : so we must 
make the best of what came to us ; choose between com- 
parative elements, not from the very highest and best. 

For the wedding, Theo decided to be married in church. 

Mr. Ross demurred at this. Church weddings seemed 
so public, so showy. He would much rather be married 
here in the parlor. 

“ I shall be married in church,’’ said Theo with calm 
decision. 

“Suppose I do not agree to it?” and Ross gave 
a little uncomfortable laugh. 

Theo flared up at that. There was a bright spot in her 
cheek, and her eyes had a steady, resolute look. 

“ If you many me at all, you will marry me in church,” 
she returned slowly. “You can do quite as you like 
about it.” 

He turned toward her. I dreaded to see them come to 
a quarrel : so I interposed with a bit of fun ; and then a 
friend dropped in. 

‘ ‘ Did you settle about the marriage ? ” I asked some 
time the next day. 

“Oh, yes! ” but it sounded petulant, or not quite at 


ease. 


 


“ Is it to be in church? ” 

“Yes. Why should one be ashamed of the great act 
of one’s hfe? I do not care if half of Northwood is 
there, or if there were but only one soul for witness. It 
seems to me that church is the proper place. When I 
die, I should like to be taken there with ‘ solemn step and 
slow.’ Remember this, Chrissie, will you? ” 

“ How absurdly you mix things, Theo ! ” and a chill 
went to my heart. 

“ I feel sometimes as if marrying and burying were not 
so very unlike. There ! It is nonsense. Yes, we are to 
be married in church.” 

First it was to be in travelling- attire. Then papa put 
in a word. It was so unsocial to go from church to the 
depot ! At home it would seem as if there had been a 
funeral. Couldn’t we have a little wine and cake, and 
a few people ? “ If it is the poverty you are thinking of, 

I would go with one meal a day afterward,” said he wistfully.

Mother laughed tremulously, and we began to consider 
again. 

Theo planned it at length. She would go to church in 
white, at — say eight in the evening ; then come home 
for a little reception. There was a train going through at 
ten, and it would suit them just as well. Father was so 
much better pleased. 

She made over her white tarlatan dress with plaitings 
of blond lace. I had a white organdie. Another inti- 
mate friend was to stand with her lover. Ned Morton 
was to TV ait upon me ; he and Mr. Ross being friends. 

With my school- salary- the first of December, and 
mother’s wdse ways, we managed. We didn’t put our 
pinches and crooks, and the sixpence saved here and 
there, for guests to look at. Is it sham, the working 
and saving, the appearing nice on a little? I had dipped 
into Caiiyie. Mollie Henderson had quoted two or three 





such trenchant sentences, that they had piqued my curi- 
osity, and I was beginning to think. Yet I am not sure 
that putting on a rough outside is nearer honesty. 

Inside there was just my school- salary, and about a 
hundred dollars that father had earned during the last 
three months, our work, care, planning, and anxiety. I 
should have had a much more expensive wedding two 
years agoiie, without half the thought. Outside there 
was a troop of white-clad maidens walking up the church- 
aisle ; the bride looking very lovely ; the groom proud, 
erect, and with manly tenderness ; the family around, — 
mother in brown silk and soft lace ; father in his best 
clothes, though they were not quite new ; Dell girlish 
in pale blue, which was very becoming ; and pretty, boy- 
ish Richard, proud that “ Theo couldn’t be an old maid 
now,” — a very young boy’s fear about his sisters. 

There was no break or contretemps. Just at eight we 
entered the church ; and fifteen minutes later Theo was 
going out on her husband’s arm, — Mrs. Ross. 

Dell and I had adorned the house with princes-pine, 
pressed fern-leaves, tufts of snowy Aaron’s-beard, and 
scarlet bitter-sweet. Miss New'by and one of our neigh- 
bors had sent in some lovely flowers. The parlor was not 
overloaded ; the sitting-room was in nice order ; the din- 
ing-room looked cheerfully inviting. There was a hand- 
somety-ornamented wedding-cake, plainer ones, plain 
cake, some choice fruit, a little wine (that was a gift 
from uncle Robert) , ice-cream, tea and cotfee for some of 
the old-fashioned friends. We had not bidden merely the 
young and gay 

It all passed off very nicely. At half-past nine Theo, 
in gray and scarlet, bright and beaming, said good-by, and 
went out into the darkness of the night, into the mystery 
of a new life. 

We laughed and chatted; and about midnight the last 
guests went away Two handmaidens had been washing 


 


dishes in the kitchen ; and it had quite a cleared-up look 
already. We put away the cake, and rehearsed some of 
the pleasant comments. Aunt Clara and uncle Robert 
had been over, and were most cordial. Aunt Clara had 
brought an exquisite lace set, collar and sleeves, and half 
a dozen yards of black thread lace, just the thing for 
Theo’s dress. There had been a number of pleasant 
remembrances. 

“ I am thankful that every thing went off so nicely,” 
exclaimed mother with a breath of relief. 

Father kissed me with a tender pressure. 

“ It is just the kind of a wedding I like,” he said. 


CHAPTER XV. 


“ I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to 
make me sad.” — As You Like It. 

Della staid at home the next day to help mother, and 
on Saturday I finished. Neighbors had been coming in, 
cake sent to absent friends. We came back to every-day 
life and to the thought that nothing could ever be quite 
as it had been, — Theo’s husband, Theo’s house presently, 
Theo’s children in the future, maybe. 

I had offered to give up om’ room to her when she came 
back. 

“No,” was her reply. “I shall take the spare cham- 
ber. This seems dedicated to our girlhood, to griefs and 
joys, and plans and confidences. It is like a first volume : 
it is the volume of girlhood, and we have been very happy, 
Chris ; so I don’t want it interhned with any new writing. 
I want to see yOU here in your rocking-chair on your side 
of the bay-window, your pictures, your ornaments on the 
bureau. I can remember so easily what the girl Theo was 
like ; and it may be a pleasure to me.” 

“ But you are happy, Theo,” I had said, with a great 
pang of fear at my heart. 

‘ ‘ Happy, of course ! Do you want me to set the win- 
dows wide open, and cry out of them, “ I am in love ! No 
woman ever loved before, no one ever will again? ’ Why, 
there are hundreds of people being married every day , and, 
if we all went on so, the world would go crazy” 

She always put off the question with some bit of fun of

ridicule. I was sorry to have her take it in such a prosaic 
way ; yet it was better than Rose Dinsmore’s flippancy. 
Would I have been more pleased with unreasoning enthusiasm
like that of Georgie Curtis? 

There was something else, — a sacred, God-given joy, 
that illumines the face, the voice, nay, the very touch of 
the hand. A glimpse of it had been vouchsafed to me. 
Theo’s married life might come up to a grand height in 
some of God’s providences ; but it did not begin there. 
Down in my secret heart I understood this fact. She 
could love with a higher, hoUer, worthier afiection, whether 
she knew it or not. 

The very next day after the marriage, father was asked 
to go over some books, and help settle a rather compli- 
cated business. By the first of January he had earned 
seventy dollars. We finished paying our coal-bill, laid in 
a barrel of flour, and some necessaries. The interest of 
the mortgage was lying safe in the bank. 

Aunt Clara asked me to come down, and receive New 
Year’s calls with her. But my best silk was shabby ; and 
I did not want to spend any money. I had a pleasant time 
with my own young friends at home. 

Theo went to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. 
On the 3rd of the new year, just dusk, they reached 
home. 

I ran out wild with joy. I had missed her so much. 

Was her face full of tears? Surely, surely. I kissed 
right in the midst of them. A great lump rose in my 
throat, and neither spoke. Mr. Ross bent over and kissed 
me, and made some ordinary comment ; Dick shouted ; 
Della and mother ran ; and then Theo was talking com- 
posedly, drawing off her gloves, and giving some order 
about the trunk. 

It seemed to me then as if Theo had been married 
years. She went up stairs while I hovered about, light- 
ing gas, stealing furtive glances at her, and asking eager 





questions. It had all been enjoyable, entertaining, full of 
interest ; but she was glad to get borne. She was tired 
to death. 

Mr. Ross came up, and I left them together. There 
they staid until the tea-bell rang. 

Theo was indescribably changed. Pale and somewhat 
thinner, and with a stylish, society air, almost like the 
superb disdain of aunt Clara’s friends. Was she happy, 
I asked wildly, passionately. 

Mr. Ross had improved. As a general thing, he was 
rather quiet ; but now he talked, and Theo was silent. 
He described Washington as a fortified city, the feeling 
about the war, a certain hopefulness that it must end 
before long, the battle-fields around, the temper of the 
people, and so on. 

Theo had a headache, and went to bed early. Mr. Ross 
waited upon her so entirely, that no one else had a chance 
to move a finger in her behalf. He even had a curious way 
of intercepting glances, of answering for her ; but per- 
haps it had come from taking complete charge of her in 
travelling. 

I was just ready to go to school the next morning when 
they came down. She looked rested ; but it was not her 
bright, happy, sparkling face. A different Theo forever- 
more. 

To divide our interest, there came that day a letter from 
Archie. He had received a lieutenant’s promotion and 
commission ; and there was a prospect that he might get 
home before the spring campaign fairly opened. 

Theo’s marriage did make a great difference. I do 
suppose the danger of living together when these new 
relationships have taken place is in the conflict of the new 
and the old claims. Mother was very wise. I grumbled a 
little at first : but she placed the matter straight before my 
eyes. I was convinced, but not satisfied. 

The “ Works ” did not open immediately: so Mr. Ross 

had nothing to do but shadow Theo. He never cared to 
go out for amusement, or to talk with men. After break- 
fast, Theo sauntered into the parlor, and played over a few 
old tunes ; then they went up stairs. After dinner there 
was generally a walk together, followed by the privacy of 
their own room. If there was no company, they might 
spend an hour or two in the parlor ; but, unless the visit 
was decidedly to Theo, they went off, and left us to enter- 
tain guestSo Several times I had gone to call her down 
of an evening ; but she was in her dressing-gown, or she 
had taken down her hair, or some other excuse. For the 
first month I do not believe I saw her half an hour alone. 
Was she kept a prisoner? I used sometimes to think that 
she was really afraid of Mr. Ross ; yet she could be bright, 
piquant, and saucy to him. 

Dell had a vacation of six weeks, and was home to help 
mother. Mr. Ross appeared to have a feeling that Theo 
must not so much as dust the parlor, or wipe a dish. And, 
although we were Imng so intimately together, we did not 
seem to grow any nearer. We always said, “ Mr. Ross.” 
The cordiality of brotherhood was altogether wanting. 
True, Theo called him Alex in speaking directly to him ; 
but the charm, the gay jollity, we had used with one 
another, appeared out of place with him. 

It would have pained me sorely but for an incident 
that happened. One day MoUie Henderson dropped down 
upon me. She had come to Northwood to get a few busi- 
ness-facts for a descriptive article ; and, as I had not 
deigned to call upon her, she resolved to hunt me up. 
Did I know that she had taken a stupendous fancy to me 
and my pretty sister? Weren’t we all crazy to let such a 
mere child many? Mrs. Durant had told her about it. 

She would not take off her hat ; but there we two sat on 
the sofa and talked until teatime ; then she staid, and I 
went to the station with her afterward. How chatty and 
breezy and stirring she was ! She wanted to take me 





home with her that night ; but I explained the tyranny of 
school, and promised to go on Friday, for she was posi- 
tively irresistible. 

Mr. Ross thought her too loud and pronounced, too 
ready to compliment, and hoped Theo did not fancy her. 

‘‘I have always found her very amusing,” said Theo 
simply. 

“And that is no business fora woman. Who could 
preserve any modesty, running round amid shops and 
factories and newspaper offices ? Such associates are of 
dubious benefit.” 

I was really vexed. If he was resolved to shut Theo 
out of every thing, he had no right over me. 

“Remember,” said mamma, “ that English people think 
very differently on many subjects. They have not been 
quite so used to the emancipation of women.” 

Not that he made an entire recluse of Theo ; but they 
were always together. He made calls, and went out to tea 
with her, or took her to some entertainment. Was he 
afraid she might be tempted to fiirt ? 

I went down to the Hendersons with an odd fear. K 
they were not really nice people, aunt Clara would not ask 
them to her house. 

MoUie was actually at the ferry to meet me. We took 
a horse- car, and chatted when there was not too great a 
din. She had tickets fora play that evening, — a cele- 
brated actor : would it not be a treat for me ? 

I thought of Mr. Sargent and the old days ; but I
