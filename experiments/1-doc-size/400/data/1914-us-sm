you to tell him is that you will get the name of a 
reputable specialist in these diseases, and that 
before he can have your daughter he must present 
you with a letter from this man, to the effect that 
he is fit to marry." 

The poor Major was all but speechless. "My 
child, who ever heard of such a proposition?" 

"I don't know that any one ever did, Papa. 
But it seems to me time they should begin to hear 
of it; and I don't see who can have a better right 
to take the first step than you and I, who have 
paid such a dreadful price for our neglect." 

Sylvia had been prepared for opposition — the 
instinctive opposition which men manifest to 
having this embarrassing subject dragged out 
into the light of day. Even men who have been 
chaste themselves — good fathers of families like 
the Major — cannot be unaware of the complica- 
tions incidental to frightening their women-folk, 
and setting up an impossibly high standard in 
sons-in-law. But Sylvia stood by her guns; 
at last she brought her father to his knees by the 
threat that if he could not bring himself to talk 
with Roger Peyton, she, Sylvia Castleman, would 
do it. 






 

The young suitor came by appointment the 
next day, and had a session with the Major in his 
office. After he had gone, Sylvia went to her 
father, and foimd him pacing the floor, with an 
extinct cigar between his hps, and several other 
ruined cigars lying on the hearth. 

"You asked him. Papa?" 

"I did, Sylvia." 

"And what did he say?" 

"Why, daughter " The Major flimg his 

cigar from him with desperate energy. "It was 
most embarrassing!" he exclaimed — "most pain- 
ful!" His pale old face was crimson with blushes. 

"Go on. Papa," said Sylvia, gentle but firm. 

"The poor boy — naturally, Sylvia, he could not 
but feel hurt that I should think it necessary to 
ask such questions. Such things are not done, 
my child. It seemed to him that I must look 
upon him as — well, as much worse than other 
yoimg fellows " 

The old man stopped, and began to walk 
restlessly up and down. "Yes, Papa," said 
Sylvia. "What else?" 

"Well, he said it seemed to him that such a 
matter might have been left to the honor of a 
man whom I was willing to think of as a son-in- 
law. And you see, my child, what an embarrass- 
ing position I was in; I could not give him any 



 

hint as to my reason for being anxious about these 
matters — anything, you understand, that might 
be to the discredit of your husband." 

"Goon, Papa." 

"Well, I gave him a fatherly talking to about 
his way of life." 

"Did you ask him the definite question as to 
his health?" 

"No, Sylvia." 

"Did he tell you anjrthing definite?" 

"No." 

"Then you didn't do what you had set out to 
do!" 

"Yes, I did. I told him that he must see a 
doctor." 

"You made quite clear to bim what you 
wanted?" 

"Yes, I did— really, I did." 

"And what did he say?" She went to him and 
took his arm and led him to a couch. "Come, 
Papa, let us get to the facts. You must tell me." 
They sat down, and the Major sighed, lit a fresh 
cigar, rolled it about in his fingers until it was 
ruined, and then flung it away. 

"Boys don't talk freely to older men," he 
said. "They really never do. You may doubt 
this " , 

"What did he say, Papa?" 

"Why, he didn't know what to say. He 
didn't really say anything." And here the Major 
came to a complete halt. 

His daughter, after studying his face for a 



 

minute, remarked, "In plain words, Papa, you 
think he has something to hide, and he may not 
be able to give you the evidence you asked?" 

The other was silent. 

"You fear that is the situation, but you are 
trjdng not to believe it." As he still said nothing, 
Sylvia whispered, "Poor Celeste!" 

Suddenly she put her hands upon his shoulders, 
and looked into his eyes. "Papa, can't you see 
what that means — that Celeste ought to have been 
told these things long ago?" 

"What good would that have done?" he asked, 
in bewilderment. 

"She could have known what kind of man she 
was choosing; and she might have been spared the 
dreadful unhappiness that is before her now." 

"Sylvia! Sylvia!" protested the other. 
"Surely such things cannot be discussed with 
innocent yoimg girls!" 

"So long as we refuse to do it, we are simply 
entering into a conspiracy with the man of loose 
life, so that he may escape the worst penalty of 
his evil-doing. Take the boys in ova own set — 
why is it they feel safe in running off to the big 
cities and 'sowing their wild oats' — even sowing 
them in the obscure parts of their own town? 
Is it not because they know that their sisters and 
girl friends are ignorant and helpless; so that 
when they are ready to pick a wife, they will be 
at no disadvantage? Here is Celeste; she knows 
that Roger has been 'wild', but no one has hinted 
to her what that means; she thinks of things 



 

that are picturesque — that he's high spirited, and 
brave, and free with his money." 

"But my daughter," protested the Major, 
"such knowledge would have a terrible effect 
upon yoimg girls!" He rose and began to pace 
the floor again. "Daughter, you are letting your- 
self run wild! The sweetness, the virginal 
innocence of young and pure women — if you take 
that from them, there'd be nothing left to keep 
men from falling to the level of brutes!" 

"Papa," said Sylvia, "all that sounds well, 
but it has no meaning. I have been robbed of 
my 'innocence', and I know that it has not 
debased me. It has only fitted me to deal with 
the realities of life. And it will do the same for 
any girl who is taught by earnest and reverent 
people. Now as it is, we have to tell Celeste, but 
we tell her too late." 

"But we won't have to tell her!" cried the 
Major. 

"Dear Papa, please explain how we can avoid 
telling her." 

"I will inform her that she must give the 
young man up. She is a good and dutiful 
daughter " 

"Yes," replied Sylvia, "but suppose on this one 
occasion she were to fail to be good and dutiful? 
Suppose the next day you were to learn that she 
had run away and married Roger — what would 
you do about it then?" 



 



 

That evening Roger was to take his fiancee to 
one of the young people's dances. And there was 
Celeste, in a flaming red dress, with a great bunch 
of flaming roses; she could wear these colors, 
with her brilliant black hair and gorgeous com- 
plexion. Roger was fair, with a frank, bojdsh 
face, and they made a pretty couple; but that 
evening Roger did not come. Sylvia helped to 
dress her sister, and then watched her wandering 
restlessly about the hall, while the hour came and 
went. Later in the evening Major Castleman 
called up the Peyton home. The boy was not 
there, and no one seemed to know where he was. 

Nor the next day did there come any explana- 
tion. At the Peytons it was still declared that no 
one had heard from Roger; and for another day 
the mystery continued, to Celeste's distress and 
mortification. At last, from Clive Chilton Sylvia 
managed to extract the truth. Roger was drunk 
— crazy drunk, and had been taken off by some of 
the boys to be straightened out. 

Of course this rumor soon got to the rest of the 
family. And they had to tell Celeste, because she 
was frantic with anxiety. There were grave con- 
sultations among the Castleman ladies. It was 
a wanton affront to his fiaTwSe that the boy had 
committed, and something must be done about 
it quickly. Then came the news that Roger had 



 

escaped from his warders, and got drunker than 
ever; he had been out at night, smashing the 
street-lamps, and it had required extreme self- 
control on the part of the town police-force to 
avoid complications. 

"Miss Margaret" went to her yoimg daughter, 
and in a tear-flooded scene informed her of the 
opinion of the family, that her self-respect 
required the breaking of the engagement. Celeste 
went into hysterics. She would not have her 
happiness ruined for life! Roger was 'wild', but 
so were all the other boys — and he would atone 
for his recklessness. She had the idea that if 
only she could get hold of him, she could recall 
him to his senses; the more her mother was 
scandalized by this proposal, the more frantically 
Celeste wept. She shut herself up in her room, 
refusing to appear at meals, and spending her 
time pacing the floor and wringiug her hands. 

The family had been through all this with then- 
eldest daughter several years before; but they 
had not learned to handle it any better. The 
whole household was in a state of distraction; 
and the condition grew worse day by day, as 
bulletins came in concerning the yoimg man. 
He seemed to have gone actually insane. He was 
not to be restrained even by his own father, and 
if the imfortunate policemen could be believed, 
he had violently attacked them. Apparently 
he was deliberately trjdng to break down the un- 
written law that the sons of the "best families" 
are not arrested. 



 

Poor Celeste, with pale, tear-drenched face, sent 
for her elder sister, to make one last appeal. 
Could Sylvia not somehow get hold of Roger and 
bring him to his senses? Could she not interview 
some of the other boys, and find out what he 
meant by his conduct? 

So Sylvia went to her cousin Clive, and had a 
talk with him — assuredly the most remarkable 
talk that that young man had ever had in his 
life. She told him that she wanted to know 
the truth about Roger Peyton; and after a cross- 
examination that would have made the reputation 
of a criminal lawyer, she got what she wanted. 
All the young men in town, it seemed, knew the 
true state of affairs, and were in a panic concern- 
ing it; that Major Castleman had sent for Roger 
and informed him that he could not marry his 
daughter until he produced a certain kind of 
medical certificate. No, he couldn't produce it! 
Was there a fellow in town who could produce it? 
What was there for him to do but to get drunk, 
and stay drunk until Celeste had cast him off? 

It was Chve's turn then to do some plain 
speaking. " Look here, Sylvia," he said. "Since 
you have made me talk about this " 

"Yes, Clive?" 

"Do you know what people are sajnng — I 
mean the reason the Major made this proposition 
to Roger?" 

She answered, in a quiet voice, "I suppose, 
Clive, it has something to do with Elaine." 

"Yes, exactly!" exclaimed Clive. "They 



 

say — " But then he stopped. He could not repeat 
it. "Surely you don't want that kind of talk, 
Sylvia." 

"Naturally, Clive, I'd prefer to escape that 
kind of talk, but my fear of it will not make me 
neglect the protection of my sister." 

"But Sylvia," cried the boy, "you don't under- 
stand about this! A woman can't understand 
about these things " 

"You are mistaken, my dear cousin," said 
Sylvia — and her voice was firm and decisive. "I 
do understand." 

"All right!" cried Clive, with sudden exaspera- 
tion. "But let me tell you this — Celeste is going 
to have a hard time getting any other man to 
propose to her!" 

"You mean, Clive, because so many of them 
are -" She stopped. 

"Yes, if you must put it that way," he said. 

There was a pause; then Sylvia went on, "Let 
us discuss the practical problem, Clive. Don't 
you think it would have been better if Roger, 
instead of going off and getting drunk, had set 
about getting himself cured?" 

The other looked at her, with evident surprise. 
"You mean in that case Celeste might marry 
him?" 

"You say the boys are all alike, Clive; and we 
can't turn our girls into nuns. Why didn't some 
of you fellows point that out to Roger?" 

"The truth is," said Clive, "we tried to." 
There was a little more cordiality in his manner, 



 

since Sylvia had shown such an unexpected 
amount of intelligence. 

"Well?" she asked. " What then?" 

"Why, he wouldn't listen to anything." 

"You mean — because he was drunk?" 

"No, we had him nearly sober. But you 
see — " And Clive paused for a moment, pain- 
fully embarrassed. "The truth is, Roger had 
been to a doctor, and been told it might take him 
a year or two to get cured." 

"Clive!" she cried. "Chve! And you mean 
that ia the face of that, he proposed to go on and
