' ' Oh ! are you sure ? Can nothing be done ? Lame 
for life ! " 

Dr. Kinnard walked up and down the office with his 
hands clasped behind him, his brain in a chaos of unrea 
son. Why should this be sent upon him? All his life, 
so far, there had been something, a thorn in the flesh to 
wound him. 

Nelly slipped one hand within his, and leaned her head 
upon his shoulder. 

" Barton," she said softly, "it is verj^, very hard for 
you to bear, I know. And yet there is some wisdom 
in it that will be shown us after a while. I think you 
have begun to love him better ; and this very love will 
bring with it a grace." 

He took the fair face in both hands, kissed brow and 
lips, and she saw there were tears in his eyes. 

" Let me comfort you," she cried. "Perhaps God 
gave me to you for this purpose. For the next few years 
he will sorely need a mother's affection and patience ; 
and so I have found my work, my duty." 

" And j'ou welcome it? O Nelly! you have reached a 
height quite beyond me. I can only see the wearisome, 
disappointing present. Bertie was not a dull scholar ; 
Mr. Herrick said so. I thought to take a pride in him as 
he grew older, to send him to college, to give him a 





profession, or establish him in business, to make a man 
of him ; and Heaven knows there is sore enough need of 
true, strong men in- this world. How can I endure " 

"It may not be so bad. Bertie" is a child yet; and 
there is a hope of his outgrowing it." 

"Hardly, if this should be a confirmed case of hip- 
disease. And, Nelly, it is weak, wicked perhaps ; but I 
have a shrinking from all kinds of deformity and lame 
ness. I pity any one profoundly ; but I am always 
thankful that it is not mine. And now it has come to 
me. If I had listened, and let you take him home " 

Nelly had thought of it many times. It had been on 
her lips that first evening ; but it seemed too much of a 
reproach to utter. 

"You shall not blame yourself," she cried. "I am 
not quite sure that I wanted to take him. And we must 
not hurry God's meanings, or distrust them, but feel that 
there is something in this for us to study or work out for 
a new satisfaction. It is the part for to-day that concerns 
us : next year will bring its own strength. We have to 
do with Bertie's childhood now ; and the man he will 
make will be such as pleases God, I hope." 

"My darling! " 

" Perhaps it will not be so bad. Is there no more 
experienced authority to consult? " 

' ' I think I will go to the city. If any thing can be 
done ! " 

" Poor child, poor baby! for he seems that now, with 
his wan little face. What suffering it would be, and yet 
much better, I suppose, than " 

" Oh ! I can't have him lame, and to go limping about 
all his life ! Yes, I must go to New York. There are 
two physicians in whom I place great confidence. If an 
operation is possible, it shall be attended to without 
delay." 

Nelly shivered. 
 

"Little tender heart! Ah, at least I did one good 
thing, even in my own selfishness. I have given him a 
mother such as " 

Nelly placed her soft fingers over her husband's lips. 
She knew the rest of the sentence would have been, " such 
as he never had." But, in her sweet and bounteous 
nature, there was no such thing as grudging another any 
due or praise, or gaining herself by that other's dispar 
agement. And, somehow, she felt tender and pitiful to 
tho woman in her grave, knowing now how she had 
missed establishing herself in her husband's heart; ever 
plucking fruit that turned to ashes, and hewing out broken 
cisterns, when the bread and wine of love's own sacrament 
was within her reach. 

" You are right," he said humbly. 

A week afterward he went to the city, and returned 
with one of his old preceptors, now an eminent and expe 
rienced physician. If he had ever such a lingering hope 
of a mistake in his own diagnosis, it was dispelled. 
There was an exceeding faint chance of tha child's out 
growing it, with a trifling lameness. There was a later 
operation, when he had more strength and maturity ; but 
the disease would also have gained greater headway. 
There was the present operation with all its risk. 

" The most important thing will be the care afterward. 
I should advise his being sent to a hospital, like St. 
Luke's for instance. Then he would have experienced 
nursing," said Dr. Francis. 

This opinion was imparted to Nelly. 

" Could you not be as watchful of the case as the best 
nurse there? " she asked of her husband. 

" Of course. But there are a hundred and one little 
things ; and it will be a very heavy tax on you." 

" If I were the child's own mother, I hardly know how 
I should decide ; but I think then, I should keep him, 
and try my best. As the case stands, I ask you as a 





favor not to send him away. He will be nearer to us 
both, if we go with him every step of the sad way. If 
you have confidence in me ' ' 

" I would trust my own life in your hands," was his 
vehement answer. " Confidence ! " 

" Then let us keep him. I should be sorry to have the 
world, or Aunt Adelaide," and she smiled with tears in 
her eyes, "think that I was glad to escape the solemn 
duties I took upon myself. And, if any thing should go 
wrong, we will not look back upon our decision regret 
fully." 

" How generous you are, Nelly!" and he studied her 
in amaze. "Honestly, I would rather keep him under 
my own eye ; but it is a great deal to ask of one young 
as you are. It may be a year or two ; and here is your 
own life ' ' 

i-'Xarn young enough surely to give away a little of it. 
Shall I not have you and your love to comfort and sus 
tain? " 

" God bless j-ou, my darling ! " 

There was coming into his soul a solemn reverence for 
womanhood. True, he had seen it under many phases ; 
but it is one thing to look at a flower in your neighbor's 
garden, without knowing all the particulars of soil and 
culture, and quite another to have it under your very eye, 
growing thriftily through shine and shade, dispensing 
fragrance and beauty da} r by day in the most bounteous 
manner. Nothing under his hand had ever so bloomed be 
fore. He had believed that nearness dispelled the charm ; 
that daily using brushed off the pink of peach, and purple 
of grape ; that household virtues throve oftener in books 
than in daily life. Nelly's strength and sweetness touched 
him with a dim amaze ; and he hardly dared place full 
faith in it, lest it should vanish. 

For herself, she had become quite strongly attached to 
Bertie. She could see how much his training had injured 





him. With a sort of moral cowardice he united great 
persistencj" ; so that, when he had once told what was not 
true, he was very apt to keep to the story, and impress it 
upon his hearers. His sense of injustice was very keen ; 
and the s} r stem of depriving him of every possible pleasure, 
of being always on the lookout for faults and naughti 
ness, of showing that he never, for a moment, was 
trusted, had worked much evil in the child's nature. 
There was another point in which Aunt Adelaide did con 
stant battle. Bertie had a vein of humor and drollery that 
his aunt could not understand. She never made jokes, 
and never saw the point of them ; and repartee, she con 
sidered, for the most part, ill bred. All this she called 
impertinence, and punished it severely ; until the child, 
between ignorance and fear, had come to have a sort of 
half-stupid hesitation. 

It was such a strange, new thing for him to be caressed, 
that at first he took it with a wondering, half-funny 
complacency. Miss Grove thought all such matters 
simply foolish, and declared that she always mistrusted 
people who were eager to make such a parade, besides the 
fact of its being under-bred. Her idea of manliness 
seemed to be stoicism. Unemotional herself, and living 
according to a code of formal rules that she had gathered 
from her very small world, she fancied, like many narrow- 
minded people, that it was adapted to age and infancy 
alike, to any kind of circumstances and position. Maud 
had never troubled her by any excess of feeling ; but she 
had been fighting the tendency in Bertie ever since his 
birth. It was her pride that the children had never been 
ill, and that they knew more than any children of their 
age. So that they behaved properly, what more w r as 
needed ? 

Nelly had touched the deadened chords of the child's 
soul. It was so nice to be made much of; to have his 
face and hands bathed, sometimes with cologne at that ; 



 

to have his hair brushed, and Nelly had trained quite a 
curly crop around his white temples ; to have dainty little 
meals served in the sick-room, just for mamma and him 
self ; to be shown pictures ; to be read stories ; to talk in 
that changeful, discursive style so natural to children, 
without having to go over a sentence, apd pick out all its 
needless words. 

Not that the child had been transformed into an angel. 
He was fretful and impatient at times, and had restless 
moods, when nothing seemed to suit. Once, when he 
was much better, he proved exceedingly troublesome in 
this respect ; and Nelly, finding herself tired, and with 
a tendency to speak sharply, bethought herself a moment. 

" Bertie," she said in a quiet tone, " I believe you are 
tired of me ; for what I do fails to please you. Now I am 
going out of the room for half an hour : look at the clock. 
You will be much better alone : so good-bj- for a little 
while." And she went away with a cheerful smile, shutting 
the door softly behind her. 

Bertie thought he did not care. He was pillowed in a 
corner of the wide lounge ; and for several moments he 
studied the fire in the grate, then his book of engrav 
ings, after that the solitaire-board ; and, to his amaze, 
only fifteen minutes were gone. The clock ticked so 
solemnly, the cat would sleep on the rug ; and there was 
absolutely nothing more to do. But then mamma would 
come in ten minutes. Oh, how long they were ! He 
tried to count the seconds, and was quite sure there were 
more than sixty. 

Through it all ran an undercurrent of conscience. 
There was no purely physical punishment or deprivation, 
but something that stirred his deeper feelings. 

The door opened presently. " Do you want me now, 
Beftie? " asked the soft voice. 

" I do, mamma, please." 

She entered with some sewing, and drew her chair close 





beside the lounge, saying cheerfully, " What shall we 
talk about, Bertie? You must have thought of a great 
many things." 

" No: never mind about talking, mamma. I want to 
lie here and look at you a little while." Then, after a 
silence, " How pretty you are, mamma ! " 

She blushed, and gave a little embarrassed laugh. 

" And you are very good to me, mamma. I thought 
at least, people say" (hesitatingly) "that step 
mothers never are good." 

' ' What do you think of it, Bertie ? ' ' and she raised her 
grave, sweet eyes. 

"It isn't true. I'll fight any boy at school who ever 
says it again; and I'll" But what could he do to 
Aunt Adelaide ? 

"No, my child: you can do better than that, love 
me ; love papa, and obey him." 

" I used to feel so afraid of papa," he went on in a 
half-musing tone. " And I am not afraid any more. His 
arms are so strong when he lifts me. And he does care 
about me, doesn't he? They all said that he wouldn't 
love Maud and me any after j*ou came." 

" Which was not true, as you have found out by this 
time," was her quiet comment. 

" Yes. Do you believe he would buy me a pony ? And 
will I ever get well? I asked him this morning." 

"What did he say?" demanded Nelly with sudden 
earnestness. 

" That he hoped so. But why does my back keep so 
weak and stiff? " 

He was to know ere long. They had decided upon 
the operation, as his general health was quite restored. 
However, nothing was said to him about it until the last 
morning. Ether was to be given. Dr. Francis and I)r. 
Searles came ; and Nelly kissed her boy with a face that 
was braver than her heart. 





"It's dreadful ! " said Mother Kinnard, who had soft 
ened unconsciously to Nelly; "and I am afraid it will 
not do a bit of good. I doubt if the child lives, anyhow. 
Tf he could only have minded his aunt ! Children were not 
so disobedient in my day. I don't believe Adelaide will 
ever get over it. No, do not go away : I am too nervous 
to stay alone. I feel as if we should hear, every moment, 
that he had died under the operation." 

It appeared to Nelly as if the inconsequent and unceas 
ing chatter would kill her. How she endured it those 
two mortal hours, she never knew. Dr. Kinnard entered 
the room at last, very pale, and with lips that had not 
yet lost the force of their compression. 

"It is through with, and was very successful," he 
announced rather huskily. ' ' Nelly y will you see to 
having a little luncheon? " 

She went about it immediately, but did not question 
him any further. Dr. Francis afterwards gave her some 
hints and suggestions, ending with, " He may be deli 
cate for a year or two ; but I think he will recover 
entirely." 

And now began another siege of nursing. They tried 
to take care of Nelly, on whom so much depended. Dr. 
Kinnard insisted on her taking frequent rides, and having 
cheerful society. Daisy came *to stay with her ; and little 
Katy Berkman was found very useful. And thus Nelly 
Kinnard reached the first anniversary of her wedding- 
day, a quiet but pleasant time with the home-folks, and 
Mr. Dudley, who was getting to be a great favorite with 
the doctor. Aunt Adelaide condescended to be quite 
gracious ; and Mrs. Kinnard said afterward, 

" What a really delightful person your mother is, Nelty ! 
I have a fancy, that, when she was young, she looked a 
great deal as you do now." 

Nelly smiled at the commendation. 

" My dear," said Dr. Kinnard that night, " I have had a 





queer notion in ray head all day. I believe I shall turn 
match-maker. I think Dudley is really taken with your 
sister. And what a charming clergyman's wife she would 
make ! Though he is not very rich in this world's goods ; 
but then your father is, without doubt, the very happiest 
man I have ever known. So it is not riches." 

" I cannot have you mapping out Daisy's life," she 
said rather confusedty. 

"But, since I have found a treasure, I am anxious to 
point out to my brethren the wonderful mine," he 
returned laughingly. 



CHAPTER XV. 

" The ordinary use of acquaintance is the sharing of talk, news, 
and mirth together ; but sorrow is the right of a friend, as a thing 
nearer the heart, and to be delivered with it." BISHOP SELDEX. 

THERE had been quite a commotion in the house with 
shopping and dressmakers, and plans for a summer tour. 
Aunt Adelaide and Maud were to go to Niagara and the 
Lakes and Canada, and wherever else their fancy led them. 
The large trunk was packed at last, and brought down to
