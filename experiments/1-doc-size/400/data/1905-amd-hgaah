land. 

"Next year we are going to Belgium, Holland, 
and Germany. One of the cousins is vice-prin- 
cipal in a New York public school, and she takes 
one nice tour every year and isn't hurried and 
flurried. I promised father I'd study at German 
good and hard, and be sure to graduate. It's just 
delightful to go that way, you see so much of the 
people." 

And once Helen had been going in that leisurely 



l 

fashion. It was an ideal of the future any way, 
and Juliet Craven would take her next summer if 
she expressed a wish to go. 

Polly Henderson smiled to herself. She had 
met her lover this summer, in a funny out-of-the- 
way place where her father had sent the whole 
family because it was inexpensive. 

"And I can't afford you any luxury beside your 
schooling," her father had said. "If ever you 
come to a place where you earn money for your- 
self, you can please yourself about such things." 

Then Ernest Stopford had come down there 
with his mother because it was her native place. 
She had passed youth before her marriage, but she 
had a splendid husband and a fine son who was 
in his father's importing house. They took a 
fancy to the Hendersons because there were so 
many children. And the last week the engage- 
ment came about, as great a surprise to Polly as 
any one. Mrs. Stopford accepted it cordially and 
invited Polly to spend the Christmas holidays 
with them. After that she would announce her 
engagement to the girls, and next summer she 
would be going abroad as a young bride, for Mr. 
Stopford had said the next one to be sent over to 
Paris should be Ernest. And she would never 
have to earn journeys or clothes or anything. She 





did not see the use of coming back to school, but 
her father had insisted. 

Marcia Hyde sat on the step talking nonsense 
to Miss Logan, who had strayed from her rather 
severe friend to outside pleasures. The girls were 
speculating upon the tie that bound them to- 
gether. 

"But there's Miss Craven and Helen Grant," 
some one had said awhile ago. 

"Helen Grant is friendly with every one. She 
seems to have an inexhaustible nature." 

"I'm not sure those diffusive natures are the 
most satisfactory," was the next comment. 

"I do not think you would call her diffusive." 

"Girl friendships are not easy to explain. I'm 
not sure but it is *the blind necessity of loving* 
that the poet speaks of, when you are away from 
home." 

So they chattered in little groups. Helen and 
Juliet were down in the far corner, half hidden 
by the vines, and only the confused sound reached 
them, unless some girl raised her voice. Helen 
had been watching the stars and speculating on 
other worlds. Turning she saw Juliet leaning 
her chin on one hand, the head bowed over a 
trifle, and her eyes with a far-away look. 

"You ought to have a picture taken," she cried 




with sudden enthusiasm. "You would make — 
well a sort of Mona Lisa; not a nun but some 
sort of sister. It's a wonder to me you didn't 
choose the convent." 

"I wanted real life, not solitude. I think I am 
not truly introspective. I'm trying to get near to 
people, not keep away from them. But I haven't 
known how. It is a wonderful gift. It is, as you 
said last winter, giving of yourself. What a 
lovely visit that was at Hope ! And I have been 
studying you ever since. But even with the same 
motive and desire two people cannot do a thing 
in the same way." 

"Why, no. There is individuality. Why, it 
would make the world tiresome !" 

"I don't know why we shouldn't copy the nice 
traits we find in other people," Juliet said, rather 
resentfully. 

"Oh, we do — sometimes," laughingly. "I have 
several ideals. I think I shall be copying Mrs. 
Aldred. I may have a girls' school some day, or 
a class in college. Then if I had a real home I 
should like to copy Daisy Bell's mother. You 
saw her in the summer, but the place to see her 
truly is the home. There is a beguiling charm in 
every motion, every word and smile. I don't 




know any one who had such a pervasive influence. 
I like Mrs. Travis very much also." 

"I was a little jealous of Daisy after you had 
made up good friends. But I knew she had some 
charming ways, and I — '* 

"You've charmed those Gartney children. How 
did that come about?" 

"They were so shy and lonely, so frightened all 
the time. You could see it in their eyes. I 
thought of my advent here. I fancy in actual ex- 
perience I was about twelve; some girls of that 
age know a great deal more. You took me by 
the hand, otherwise I do not believe I could have 
remained. Oh, you can't think how I longed to 
have some one love me ! And I just guessed how 
these little girls felt. I couldn't have proffered 
comfort and affection to older people, but they 
were not going to be critical. They are so deli- 
cate, too, they have been trained in the nice ways 
of what is called good breeding, I suppose. And 
you know I had no training." 

"You had a natural longing for refinement. 
Why, I do not see how you kept so much of it, 
rather how you obtained it living with one queer, 
rough old man. 

"Do they say much about their new mother? 



 

That term tells the whole story; the distance. 
And I do not see why their father — *' 

"He is very fond of her, admires her im- 
mensely. And he adores his children as well. 
She isn't grudging — you can see by the children's 
clothing. They have pocket money in abundance ; 
Miss Wiley takes charge of that. They have 
lived so alone with their father and the governess 
that they hardly understand the free masonry of 
children. That is where I could sympathize with 
them," and a tender smile crossed the girl's 
face. 

"I suppose the key note is jealousy. Only a 
large-minded woman ought ever to accept the 
children of a dead mother." 

"Or a woman hungering for love and never 
having been satisfied." 

Helen caught her friend's hand in an eager 
clasp. "Something lovely ought to happen to 
you," she said in a kind of impassioned tone. "A 
great house full of people, little and big, and all 
the love you want." 

Why had so many people loved her, Helen 
wondered? 

"Girls, come in and let us have a good sing," 
exclaimed Miss Aldred. "Miss Craven must play 





for US. We have lengthened out our holiday, and 
I hope you have had a good time." 

"And you are just lovely!" declared one en- 
thusiastic girl presently. "The clock is striking 
ten and you lengthen out the indulgence. Will 
you give us another half -hour?" 

"We are just a family now and not a school," 
said Mrs. Aldred. "And, girls, you cannot think 
how gratifying it is to have you so glad to come 
back, so eager to go on with your studies, so am- 
bitious, so cordial to each other. I hope it will be 
a happy and successful year, and that we shall not 
only strive for some new virtues, but practise 
those we have already acquired, that our char- 
acters may not be like the shifting sand of the sea 
shore, sparkling, fascinating but forever chang- 
ing. And now you may have your half-hour for 
singing." 

A very delightful time it proved, and there 
were heartfelt good nights, as they trooped up the 
stairs. 

"Oh," Helen said with a long breath, "it is so 
satisfying to live among girls in your girlhood." 
Yet she looked with a sweet resignation at those 
months when she was without any such delight, 
when the vitality of hope and joy was relegated 
to the background. "Poor father." How many 



 

a time she had breathed a little prayer for the 
dead. It would not harm her. 

Sunday was another glorious day. The girls 
went to their different churches, the smaller ones 
in the care of Miss Wiley. Miss Craven had 
spent a few moments with her two little girls and 
somehow she felt very happy herself and at rest. 
A year without any changes or anxiety looked 
attractive. She was beginning to enjoy being 
settled. 

Mrs. Danforth hurried out of church a little to 
meet them, smiling and eager. 

"Oh," she exclaimed, "wasn't it odd that you 
should meet Gordon down there at Balem ! He 
has been such friends with the Travis family, but 
he had not seen you, Miss Grant, in such a long 
time, yet he said you had grown into just the big 
girl one could surely predict And your charm- 
ing friend, Mrs. Wilmarth! He did enjoy the 
fortnight so. You must come to the Parsonage 
some afternoon and let us talk it all over. To 
think I shall not see him for two, perhaps three, 
years. But his father was very proud of the 
appointment.** 

"We all had a delightful time," Helen replied 
with her bright smile. She was glad he had en- 



AN ATMOSPHERE OF COMRADESHIP iy$ 

joyed it as well. It brought a peculiar nearness 
to another mother. There were some charming 
mothers in the world. 



CHAPTER X 

THE BEGINNING OF THINGS 

A WHOLE school year with no break, nothing 
of importance happening, for there was no one 
now who had a first claim on her, Helen Grant 
thought, as she took her place in her classes with 
enthusiastic gladness. She did so love to study, 
to acquire knowledge, to reach out into the rich- 
ness of the whole earth. Not all of it, but a bit 
here and there ; no brain could hold it all. She 
was a born student. Her old teacher, Mr. War- 
field, thought he had made her one, but he had 
only tilled the ground ; the seed had been planted 
by a Higher Hand. 

And beside the study, she found life was grow- 
ing in breadth and meaning, that each day the 
mystery was unfolding, the joy becoming more 
intense, the influences all pervading. It was not 
a straight line, though duty is often considered 
that; it was a step one way and another, some- 
times the wrong way and then one had to retrace. 
Why couldn't God have made people so clear- 
eyed they could see at once ! 


Yet with her quick sense of fun she soon be- 
came the same favorite with the larger girls as 
she had been with, the smaller ones two years be- 
fore. And girls began to give her confidences. 
Polly Henderson told her of her engagement. 

'*Of course you know I had to tell Mrs. Aldred, 
and mother wrote explaining, but Tm not going 
to breathe it to another soul. Only I did want 
you to know. I must have some one to rejoice 
with me. Did you ever know of such a perfect 
romance ?" 

Helen was interested. Love matters are such 
a sweet mystery to the girl who knows nothing 
about them. 

"Generally the mothers don't like it, you see. 
They're jealous to have their sons love any one 
else. But Mrs. Stopford isn't. It's queer, but 
she seems as if she might be Ernest's grand- 
mother. Her hair is snowy white, and she was 
forty years old when Ernest was born, and had 
been married seven years. And she wishes she 
had five, like mother. So she wants Ernest to be 
married, and she's just old-fashioned enough to 
think I am real pretty. I have a lovely com- 
plexion and color and my hair is a pretty shade. 
Ernest likes light hair, his is brown, quite dark. 
He's — well, he isn't handsome, but he is quite tall 



 

and stands up straight and has an air. I think 
men don't need to be handsome, only nice-look- 
ing. And I'm just counting the weeks to Christ- 
mas, then I shall count them to June." 

"And you won't graduate if you don't study 
more in earnest," interposed Helen. 

"Well, if I just squeeze through it won't mat- 
ter now. I'm so glad I won't have to teach or do 
anything. I should hate it. Sophie's next to me 
and she has a genius for gowns and hats, and 
mother isn't going to send her away to trade 
school, though she wants to go. She's at the 
High School now." 

"You must run away," declared Helen. "I 
have to translate some Latin verses and do a 
French exercise." 

"Do you suppose that pretty little Daisy Bell is 
engaged ? Oh, we used to be great chump. She 
had two or three lovers, but maybe they weren't 
real marfying ones. I used to feel jealous when 
she paraded them out. She had photographs of 
two. I think she was a flirt." 

"Polly, will you run away !" decisively. 

"Oh, I wish you were not going to college and 
could take a little time. I like you the best of any 
girl in the class. Yes, I really am going." 

"I won't look at a lover until I am through 




college," Helen said sighingly to herself. "Love 
does make a girl silly;" and she turned to her 
Latin verses. 

She was not a born versifier. Margaret 
Holden would be the class poet, for she was a 
real poet. Two magazines had accepted and 
paid her for some work, one poem and a 
composition of last year that Mrs. Wiley had said 
was as fine as most of the magazine work. Mar- 
garet was bright and gay, but the poems were 
curious with a vein of something akin to hope- 
lessness running through them, a world weariness 
as if she had known the depths of sorrow. There 
were girls full of fun, there were flippant and 
superficial ones, and there were two or three tak- 
ing life with great gravity and with less cause in 
some ways than Juliet Craven. Miss Kent was 
one of them. She was so in earnest that she 
stripped life of most of its graces. She was going 
to college and then meant to study medicine in 
which she was strongly interested intellectually. 

"But she will never make a successful doctor,"
