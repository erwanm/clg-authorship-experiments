strained nerves, and the shrinking of a sore and pained 
soul. 

In the hurrying rush of events, she had managed to for- 
get herself, and have others forget the cruel wound that 
had been given to faith and hope. But now she glanced 
at the far future in dismay a long, dreary, purposeless 
woman's life, without any aims or ambitions. A spark of 
genius might have aroused her, but that she fancied she 
did not possess. Any urgent duty would have excited her 
to action, but her mother and Philip insisted that her sea- 
son of rest had come. The heavy eyes and pale cheeks 
needed something besides labor to restore roses and 
brightness. 

The vague rest had in it a deeper unrest. Perhaps it is 
life's dreariest pain to come to a time when circumstances 
invest us again with a halo that rendered us fair in the 
eyes of the world, and yet to feel keenly what the few 
years of exile have taken from us never to be replaced. 
And to young souls, whose vision is still narrow, there will 
come moments when some touch of the cold fingers of 
sorrow strikes upon life's harp and produces discord, when 
no fine sympathy can attune what might have been and 
is not. 

Not that Madge was a love-lorn girl, still brooding over 
her disappointment. She had thrust it out of sight at the 



 

beginning, and bowed to the inevitable. But in the men- 
tal vacuity that fell upon her now, all things lost their 
vital charm. She was exact in her religious duties, but 
the fervor that had once made them so comforting seemed 
no more. She accompanied Jessie on her visits of kind- 
ness and charity, but the too often tiresome stories from 
vapid and narrow souls wearied her exceedingly. 

" I don't see how you can endure it," she said to Jessie, 
" I rather like Bessie Deane, and Hetty Bright has a crisp- 
ness of her own that is quite refreshing. But these old 
women who take your gifts and grumble at you, who 
think their pains and aches so much more severe than 
those of the rest of the world, are an intolerable nuisance. 
How can you listen so patiently ? " 

" Their sorrows and petty trials are very real to them. 
And it is their misfortune that their sphere is so narrow." 

" But they look continually at the four bare walls, in- 
stead of out of the window, where they might catch a 
glimpse of the blue sky." 

"Do we never commit the same fault ourselves? Do 
we never forget that heaven is the bit of blue sky, when 
we refuse to lift our eyes ? " 

Madge colored. Had she been looking steadily at the four 
walls, dark and narrow, with no ray of sympathetic love ? 

" Jessie," after a long pause, " how can you always keep 
so calm and tranquil ? " 

"Do I ? " with a soft little smile. 

" It seems so to me as if nothing ever troubled you." 

" And yet a great many things have troubled and pained 
me. Only since God has asked us to cast our burdens 
upon Him " 

"I am afraid that is what I don't understand," Madge 
answered, thoughtfully. "For when we look about and 
see the many trials that are brought upon us by the self- 
ishness of others, we sometimes question whether God 
has anything to do with it." 
 





" O Madge ! God doesn't mean that we shall question 
the acts of others. It is just the effect upon ourselvea 
that concerns us. It seems to me that all this weary 
wondering with which we perplex ourselves is the part of 
the burden that He is so willing to bear." 

Madge sighed. 

"My darling, do you mean to go treading on thorns 
when there are pleasanter paths ? " said the sweet, plead- 
ing voice. 

"O, Jessie, there is so much, after all, that is wearisome 
in life ! Sometimes I almost wish I was back at the old 
work, when I had no time for thought." 

"But we cannot get away from ourselves; so we must 
divide the burden." 

"How can one do it?" 

"By taking part of some other person's." 

"But it seems to me that you are all so happy now, 
there is nothing left for me to do. I begin to feel that a 
woman's sphere is essentially narrow, unless there is some 
special demand made upon her. And I have a horror of 
falling into the inanities and foolish weakness of some 
people." 

They had been rambling slowly along through this talk. 
It was a mild March day, with a breath of spring in the 
air ; and now they paused, as they saw Mr. Wyverne com- 
ing in the opposite direction, with his hands full of 
trailing arbutus. 

"The first trophies of spring," he said, with a smile. 
"Come in, and share them with me." 

He opened the gate as he spoke, and the two girk 
entered almost involuntarily. 

There, in the cozy sitting-room, they found Miss Wy- 
verne and Miss Hetty. 

"We were having an old maid's gossip," explained Miss 
Wyverne, laughingly, "and were just thinking of starting 
out for Home Nook to hold another solemn conclave. So 



 

we are most glad to welcome you. O, Robert, what a de- 
licious armful of wild flowers ! You have made a pilgrim- 
age to the woods without me." 

"I strayed into it without the slightest intention, I 
assure you. Go on with your talk while I make a bouquet 
for Mrs. Graham. I see that Miss Hetty's face is brimful 
of something." 

The same odd little body, with her head still full of 
silvery curls, and a complexion as fresh as a child's. It 
seemed to Jessie as if she would never grow old. 

"I wanted to see you, my dear," to Jessie. "I had an 
idea in my head, and you know that such a thing can 
never stay there long without causing me a deal of 
trouble." 

" The results of your ideas are so excellent that they 
deserve to be brought forward as soon as possible," said 
Mr. Wyverne, making a mound with his flowers on the 
green leathern-covered library table. 

"And what wag this ?" asked Jessie. 

Miss Hetty colored a little, and for a moment seemed 
hardly ready with a reply. 

"It is a really grand idea," declared Miss Wyverne. 
" A hospital for sick and disabled old ladies." 

Miss Hetty laughed merrily. 

"I suppose you think I shall have it all ready to go into, 
myself, but I mean to keep brisk for many a year yet." 

"What gave you the idea, Miss Hetty?" asked Mr. 
Wyverne. 

* Well, I've had a hospital, as you may say, nearly all 
my life, and I've grown rather fond of nursing. Poor deal 
sister used often to say, for she was always thinking of 
others, *I wish every one who was sick could have as 
good care as I do.' And there's that poor Jenny Yates 
lying helpless in her sister's house, with a crowd of noisy 
children around her, and suffering everything for the wanv 
of a little quiet ar^ care. It makes my heart ache every 





time I look at her. And here I am with oceans of money 
that I don't know what to do with " 

Miss Hetty paused for breath, her little round face 
quite flushed and excited. 

"What a misfortune !" said Mr. Wyverne, with a touch 
of quiet amusement. 

" Well, there's quite a large income, beyond what I can 
use ; and I never did approve of burying any talent that 
might come to me. And I've been casting about as to 
what I could do. You see, there's no kith or kin for me 
to adopt, and it seems now as if I had nothing to busy 
myself with. So if I take in a few of the poor and dis- 
abled" 

"A cup of cold water," said Jessie, softly, slipping her 
hand within Miss Hetty's. 

"But the house is such a little pigeon's nest, and it 
would have to be made larger. I was coming to see Miss 
Jessie about it." 

" O, you must let Madge plan that ! She has a gift for 
such things." 

" The extent of my genius for drawing," said Madge, 
with a laugh. 

" And you really think of undertaking this ? " asked Mr. 
Wyverne, seriously. 

" I ought to improve the time I have left, remembering 
whose it is. And the money, you know, came so like a 
gift we never expected to see a penny of it." 

Miss Hetty still held it in a peculiar awe, as if it was 
hardly her own. 

"It will be a most noble work," said Mr. Wyverne, 
* and many of our great enterprises have been started on 
"smaller scale. But you must be prepared for ingrati- 
tude and misrepresentation. I cannot understand why, 
but nearly all good objects have to make a hard fight in 
the beginning." 

"I am sure if I don't ask any odds of anybody there 



need be little trouble. And if I offer them food, and 
shelter, and care " 

"You will be making the best and highest use of your 
means, and God can but smile upon your undertaking." 

Jessie was delighted with the idea, and insisted that 
Miss Hetty should come and take tea with them, when 
they would discuss it more at length. Mr. Wyverne 
walked over also, sure of a welcome. Madge fell a little 
behind, and accepted him for a companion, and when 
Jessie saw the bright eyes and soft cheeks warm with a 
delicate flush, she smiled inwardly. 

They found that Miss Hetty had digested her ideas 
more thoroughly than appeared on the surface. She was 
in truest earnest; and, with her usual energy, but little 
time was to be lost in considering the feasibility of the 
scheme, as it affected those at a distance. It was good, 
heartsome work, and she was willing to undertake it ; so 
why should she delay ? 

" Only, I couldn't take in more than two or three, as the 
place stands. I have a fancy that I should always like to 
keep Rachel's room as it is, to be a kind of sanctuary to 
me when I am a little tired or discouraged, if such a 
thing ever happens to me. But right at the side we 
might build an addition, and I could have the flower- 
garden left as it is." 

"The plan is very sensible," said Mr. Graham. "You 
will feel more comfortable to have part of your house 
reserved strictly for your own use. But you surely could 
not take care of many invalids. " 

"I could find nurses as I wanted them. One and 
another poor homeless creature would be glad to come ; 
and now, if any one will learn for me what kind of a place 
I could put up, say, for six or seven thousand dollars that 
is as much as I should feel free to spend." 

"Miss Madge," said Mr. Wyv erne, " what was it you! 
sister said about your gift for pla/ming houses?" 





Madge laughed a little. 

"O, it was nothing. Instead of drawing landscapes and 
foliage, I used to fill my paper with cottages, and all man- 
ner of odd rooms, and nooks, and corners. I suppose it 
was because I loved this old house so well." 

"Will you not show them to me ?" 

" They are hardly worth the going over." 

" Still, I desire it." 

Madge brought her portfolio, and the two sat down to 
a little quartet table, and began to inspect the sketches 
that were done with the neatness and fidelity of a steel 
engraving. 

"So you think you have no genius," he said, laugh- 
ingly. 

"Not enough for my ambition. I could never paint a 
picture ; and these are nearly all hints and suggestions 
from things I have seen." 

"What is this?" 

Madge colored warmly. 

" O, this is part of my chapel. I did not know that it 
was here." 

"Miss Ashburton, you ought to study architecture. I 
wonder that this field is not entered by women." 

" Because we go everywhere ? " and she smiled. 

"No, but because women understand so much more 
thoroughly the uses of a house than a man. And thia 
is " 

" My east window. You see, I meant to be very grand. 
I did that not long ago." 

He studied it attentively. The brilliant colors were 
most artistically arranged, and the design perfect. 

Then they were called upon to share some discussion as 
to the plan under consideration, and Madge forgot about 
her chapel until the party broke up, when Mr. Wyverne 
said, 

"I wish to take this window with me may I? It 
interests me very much.'* 



 

Madge nodded acquiescently. 

Miss Hetty begged for a little music, " for it is next t 
hearing it in church," said she. 

Mr. Wyverne sat down to the piano, then asked 
Eleanor to select something. 

Two verses seemed peculiarly touching to both Miss 
Hetty and Madge : 

" In the wilderness astray, 

In the lonely waste they roam, 
Hungry, fainting by the way, 
Far from refuge, shelter, home. 

" To the Lord their God they cry ; 

He inclines a gracious ear, 
Sends deliverance from on high, 
Rescues them from all their fear." 

And if Miss Hetty could find a duty that would be 
both labor and love, would Madge fail if she sought ear- 
nestly ? Looking down the dim future, she seemed to see 
a tall and slender Miss Ashburton, with some silvery 
threads in her bright hair, but the face subdued to the 
womanly sweetness of one who has found rest for her 
soul 







CHAPTER XXTL 

WORK IN EABNEST. 

Miss HETTY encountered some of the difficulties in the 
path the very next day. She called on Jenny Yates, who 
listened to her proposal with the utmost gratitude ; but 
Mrs Brown, her sister, a loud, slatternly kind of woman, 
was roused to indignation. 

"Do you think I'm so poor that I can't take care of 
her myself and rny own sister, too? If she's com- 
plained to you, she's a miserable, ungrateful hussy ! I'm 
sure she has the best of everything, and me a slaving off 
my very finger ends ! "
