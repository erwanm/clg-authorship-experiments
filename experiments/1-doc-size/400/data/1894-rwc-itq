Afterward I went to you. You were gone." 
Her low voice was heart-breaking to hear. 

"When?" Rex could hardly utter a word. 

"In June, as soon as I left the hospital." 

"The hospital? And your mother?" 

"She was dead. I did not see her. Then I was 
very ill, along time. As soon as I could, I went 
to Paris." 

"To me?" 

"Yes." 

"And the letter?" 

"Ah!"-cried Yvonne with a shudder. "It must 
have been my sister who did that!" 

The room was turning round. A hundred 
lights were swaying about in a crowd of heads. 
Rex laid his hand heavily on the table to steady 
himself. With a strong effort at self-control he 
had reduced the number of lights to two, and 
got the people back in their places, when with 
a little burst of French exclamations and laugh 
ter every one turned to Yvonne, and Ruth bend 
ing over her took both her hands. 

The next moment Monsieur Bordier was lead 
ing her to the piano. 



 

A soft chord, other chords, deep and sweet, 
and then the dear voice: 

"Oui c est un reve, 

Un reve doux'd amour, 

La nuit lui prete son mystere." 

The chain is forged again. The mists of pas 
sion rise thickly, heavily, and blot out all else 
forever. 

He"lene's song ceased. He heard them praise 
her, and heard "Good-nights," and "Aurevoirs" 
exchanged. He rose and stood near the door. 
Ruth passed him like a shadow. They all remained at the foot of the stairs for a moment, 
repeating their "Adieus," and "Remerciements." 
He was utterly reckless, but cool enough still to 
watch for his chance in this confusion of civil 
ities. It came; for one instant he could whis 
per to her, "I must see you to-night." Then 
the voices were gone, and he stood alone on the 
porch, the wet wind blowing in his face, his face 
turned up to a heavy sky covered with black, 
driving clouds. He could hear the river, and 
the moaning of the trees. 

It seemed as if he had stood there for hours, 
never moving. Then there was a step in the 





dark hall, on the threshold, and Yvonne lay 
trembling in his arms. 

The sky was beginning to show a tint of early 
dawn when they stepped once more upon the 
silent porch. The wind had gone down. Clouds 
were piled up in the west, but the east was clear. 
Perfect stillness was over everything. Not a 
living creature was in sight, excepting that far 
up, across the stream, Sepp and Zimbach were 
climbing toward the Schinder. 

"I must go in now. I must, you child!" said 
Yvonne in her old voice, smoothing her hair 
with both hands. Rex held her back. 

"My wife?" he said. 

"Yes!" She raised her face and kissed him 
on the lips, then clung to him weeping. 

"Hush! hush! It is I who should do that," 
he murmured, pressing her cheek against his 
breast. 

Once more she turned to leave him, but he 
detained her. 

"Yvonne, come with me and be married to 
day!" 

"You know it is impossible. To-day! what a 
boy you are! As if we could!" 



 

"Well then, in a few days, in a week, as soon 
as possible." 

"Oh! my dearest! do not make it so hard for 
me! How could I desert Madame so? After 
all she has done for me? When I know all her 
hopes are set on me; that if I fail her she has 
no one ready to take my place! Because she 
was so sure of me, she did not try to bring on 
any other pupil for next autumn. And last sea 
son was a bad one for her and Monsieur. Their 
debutante failed; they lost money. Behold this 
child!" she exclaimed, with a rapid return to 
her old gay manner, "to whom I have explained 
all this at least a hundred times already, and he 
asks me why we cannot be married to-day!" 

Then with another quick change, she laid her 
cheek tenderly against his and murmured: 

"I might have died but for her. You would 
not have me desert her so cruelly, Rex?" 

"My love! No!" A new respect mingled 
with his passion. Yes, she was faithful! 

"And now I will go in! Rex, Rex, you are 
quite as bad as ever! Look at my hair!" She 
leaned lightly on his shoulder, her old laughing 
self, 





He smiled back sadly. 

"Again! After all! You silly, silly boy! 
And it is such a little while to wait!" 

" Belle Helene is very popular in Paris. The 
piece may run a long time." 

"Rex, I must. Don't make it so hard for 
me!" Tears filled her eyes. 

He kissed her for answer, without speak 
ing. 

"Think! think of all she did for me; saved 
me; fed me, clothed me, taught me, when she 
only believed I had voice and talent enough to 
support myself by teaching. It was half a year 
before she and Monsieur began to think I could 
ever make them any return for their care of me. 
And all that time she was like a mother to me. 
And now she has told every one her hopes of me. 
If I fail she will be ridiculed. You know Paris. 
She and Monsieur have enemies who will say 
there never was any pupil, nor any debut ex 
pected. Perhaps she will lose her prestige. The 
fashion may turn to some other teacher. You 
know what malice can do with ridicule in Paris. 
Let me sing for her this once, make her one 
great success, win her one triumph, and then 



 

never, never sing again for any soul but you, 
my husband!" 

Her voice sank at the last words, from its 
eager pleading, to an exquisite modest sweet 
ness. 

"But if you fail?" 

"I shall not fail. I have never doubted that 
I should have a success. Perhaps it is because 
for myself I do not care, that I have no fear. 
When I had lost you I only thought of that. 
And now that I have found you again !" 

She clung to him in passionate silence. 

"And I may not see your debut?" 

"If you come I shall surely fail! I must for 
get you. I must think only of my part. What 
do I care for the house full of strange faces? I 
will make them all rise up and shout my name. 
But if you were there, Ah! I should have no 
longer any courage! Promise me to come only 
on the second night." 

"But if you do fail, I may come and take you 
immediately before Monsieur the Maire?" 

"If you please!" she whispered demurely. 

And they both laughed, the old happy-chil 
dren laugh of the Atelier, 





"I suppose you are bad enough to hope that 
I will fail," added she presently, with a little 
moue. 

"Yvonne," said Rex earnestly, "I hope that 
you will succeed. I know you will, and I can 
wait for you a few weeks more." 

" We have waited for our happiness two years. 
We will make the happiness of others now first, 
n est ce pas?" she whispered. 

The sky began to glow, and the house was 
astir. Rex knew how it would soon be talking, 
but he cared for nothing that the world could do 
or say. 

"Ah! we will be happy! Think of it! A little 
house near the Pare Monceau, my studio there, 
Clifford, Elliott, Rowden, Bra all of them 
coming again! And it will be my wife who will 
receive them!" 

She placed a little soft palm across his lips. 

"Taisez-vous, mon ami! It is too soon! See 
the morning! I must go. There! yes one 
more! my love, Adieu!" 



CHAPTER XVI. 

Fewer tourists and more hunters had been 
coming to the Lodge of late; the crack of the 
rifle sounded all day. There was great talk of 
a hunt which the duke would hold in Septem 
ber, and the colonel and Rex were invited. But 
though September was now only a few days off, 
the colonel was growing too restless to wait. 

After Yvonne's visit, he and Ruth were much 
together. It seemed to happen so. They took 
long walks into the woods, but Ruth seemed to 
share now her father's aversion to climbing, and 
Gethryn stalked the deer with only the Jaegers 
for company. 

Ruth and her father used to come home with 
their arms full of wild flowers, the fair, lovely 
wild blossoms of Bavaria, which sprang up 
everywhere in their path. The colonel was great 
company on these expeditions, singing airs from 
obsolete operas of his youth, and telling stories 
of La Grange, Brignoli and Amodio, of the. 





Strakosches and Maretzeks,with much liveliness. 
Sometimes there would be a silence, however, 
and then if Ruth looked up she often met his 
eyes. Then he would smile and say: 

"Well, Daisy!" and she would smile and say: 

"Well, dear!" 

But this could not last. About a week after 
Yvonne's visit the colonel, after one of these 
walks, instead of joining Rex for a smoke, left 
him sitting with Ruth under the beech tree, and 
mounted the stairs to Mrs. Dene's room. 

It was an hour later when he rose and kissed 
his wife, who had been sitting at her window all 
the time of their quiet talk, with eyes fixed on 
the young people below. 

"I never dreamed of it!" said he. 

"I did, I wished it," was her answer. "I 
thought he was, but they are all alike!" she 
ended sadly and bitterly. "To think of a boy 
as well born as Rex " But the colonel, who 
possibly knew more about well born boys than 
his wife did, interrupted her: 

"Hang the boys! It's Ruth I'm grieved for!" 

"My daughter needs no one's solicitude, not 
even ours!" said the old lady haughtily. 



"Right! Thank God!" said the veteran, in 
a tone of relief. "Good-night, my dear!" 

Two days later they left for Paris. 

Rex accompanied them as far as Schicksalsee, 
promising to follow them in a few days. 

The handsome, soldierly-looking Herr Forster 
stood by their carriage and gave them a "Gliick- 
liche Reise!" and a warm "Auf Wiedersehen!" 
as they drove away. Returning up the steps 
slowly and seriously, he caught the eye of Sepp 
and Federl, who had been looking after the 
carriage as it turned out of sight, beyond the 
bridge: 

"Schade!" said the Herr Forster, and went 
into the house. 

"Schade!" said Federl. 

"Jammer-schade!" growled Sepp. 

On the platform at Schicksalsee Rex and 
Ruth were walking while they waited for the 
train. "Ruth," said Rex, "I hope you never 
will need a friend's life to save yours from harm; 
but- if you do, take mine." 

"Yes, Rex." She raised her eyes and looked 
into the distance. Far on the horizon loomed 
the Red Peat 





The clumsy mail drew up beside the platform. 
It was the year when all the world was running 
after a very common-place Operetta, with one 
lovely stolen song: a Volks-song. One heard 
it everywhere, on both continents; and now as 
the postillion, in his shiny hat, with the cock 
ade, his light blue jacket, and white small 
clothes, and his curly brass horn, came rattling 
down the street, he was playing the same 
melody. 

"Es ist im Leben hasslich eingerichtet " 

The train drew into the station. When it 
panted forth again, Gethryn stood waving his 
hand, and watched it out of sight. 

Turning at last to leave the platform, he found 
that the crowd had melted away; only a residue 
of crimson-capped officials remained. He in 
quired of one where he could find an express 
man, and was referred to a mild man absorbing 
a bad cigar. With him Gethryn arranged for 
having his traps brought from Trauerbach and 
consigned to the brothers Schnurr at the "Gast- 
hof zur Post," Schicksalsee, that inn being close 
to the station. 

This settled, he lighted a cigarette and strolled 



 

across to his hotel, sitting down on a stone bench 
before the door, and looking off at the lake. 

It was mid-afternoon. The little place was 
asleep. Nothing was stirring about the inn excepting a bandy Dachshund, which came wheez 
ing up and thrust a cold nose into the young 
man's hand. High in the air a hawk was 
wheeling; his faint, querulous cry struck Gethryn 
with an unwonted sense of loneliness. He 
noticed how yellow some of the trees were on 
the slopes across the lake. Autumn had come
