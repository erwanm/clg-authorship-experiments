Tall, slender, not handsome, but 
superb and therewith so perfectly 
sent out, so well groomed, that Cicero 
mistook him for a fop from whom the 
republic had nothing to fear; splendidly lavish, exquisitely gracious, he 
was born to charm and his charm 
was such that it still subsists. Cato 
alone was unenthralled. But Cato 
was never pleased; he laughed but 
once, and all Rome turned out to see 
him; he belonged to an earlier day, 
to an austerer, perhaps to a better 
one, and it may be that in "that 
woman," as he called CEcsar, his 
clearer vision discerned beneath the 
plumage of the peacock, the beak and 
talons of the bird of prey. For they 
were there, and needed only a vote of 
the senate to batten on nations of 
which the senate had  never heard. 
Loan him an army, and "that woman" 
was to give geograpliy such a twist 



 



that to-day whoso says Caesar says 
history. 

Was it this that Cato saw, or may 
it be that one of the oracles which had 
not ceased to speak had told him of 
that coming night when he was to 
take his own life, fearful lest "that 
. woman" should overwhelm him with 
the magnificence of his forgiveness? 
Cato walks through history, as he 
walked through the Forum, bare of 
foot — too severe to be simple, too obstinate to be generous — the image of 
Ancient Rome. 

In CjRsar there was nothing of this. 
He was wholly modern; dissolute 
enough for any epoch, but possessed 
of virtues that his contemporaries 
could not spell. A slave tried to poison 
him. Suetonius says he merely put 
the slave to. death. The "merely" is 
to the point. Cato would have tortured 
him first. After Pharsalus he forgave 



 







everyone. When severe, it was to himself. It is true he turned over two million people into so many dead flies, their 
legs in the air, creating, as Tacitus 
has it, a solitude which he described 
as Peace; but what antitheses may 
not be expected in a man who, before 
the first century was begun, divined 
the fifth, and who in the Suevians — 
that terrible people beside whom no 
nation could live — foresaw Attila! 

Save in battle his health was poor. 
He was epileptic, his strength undermined by incessant debauches; yet let 
a nation fancying him months away 
put on insurgent airs, and on that nation he descended as the thunder does. 
In his campaigns time and again he 
overtook his own messengers. A 
phantom in a ballad was not swifter 
than he. Simultaneously his sword 
flashed in Germany, on the banks of 
the Adriatic, in that Ultima Thule 




 

where the Britons hved. From the 
depths of Gaul he dominated Rome, 
and therewith he was penetrating 
impenetrable forests, trailing legions 
as a torch trails smoke, erecting walls 
that a nation could not cross, turning 
soldiers into marines, infantry into 
cavalry, building roads that are roads 
to-day, fighting with one hand and 
writing an epic with the other, dictating love-letters, chronicles, dramas; 
finding time to make a collection of 
witticisms; overturning thrones while 
he decorated Greece; minglinginitiate 
into orgies of the Druids, and, as 
the cymbals clashed, coquetting with 
those terrible virgins who awoke the 
tempest ; not only conquering, but 
captivating, transforming barbarians 
into soldiers and those soldiers into 
senators, submitting three hundred 
nations and ransacking Britannia for 
pearls for his mistresses' ears. 


 



Each epoch has its secret, and each 
epoch-maker his own. Caesar's secret 
lay in the power he had of projecting 
a soul into the ranks of an army, of 
making legions and their leader one. 
Disobedience only he punished; anything else he forgave. After a victory 
his soldiery did what they liked. He 
gave them arms, slaves to burnish 
them, women, feasts, ' sleep. They 
were his comrades ; he called them so ; 
he wept at the death of any of them, 
and when they were frightened, as 
they were in Gaul before they met 
the Germans, and in Africa before 
they encountered Juba, Csar frightened them still more. He permitted 
no questions, no making of wills. 
The cowards could hide where they 
liked; his old guard, the Tenth, would 
do the work alone; or, threat still 
more sinister, he would command a 
retreat. Ah, that, never! Fanaticism 



 



returned, the legions begged to be 
punished. 

Michelet says he would like to have 
seen him crossing Gaul, bare-headed 
in the rain. It would have been as 
interesting, perhaps, to have watched 
him beneath the shade of the velarium pleading the cause of Masintha 
against the Numidian king. Before 
him was a crowd that covered not 
the Forum alone, but the steps of the 
adjacent temples, the roofs of the 
basilicas, the arches of Janus, one that 
extended remotely to the black walls 
of the Curia Hostilia beyond. And 
there, on the rostrum, a musician behind him supplying the la from a flute, 
the air filled with gold motes, Csesar, 
his toga becomingly adjusted, a jew- 
elled hand extended, opened for the 
defense. Presently, when through 
the exercise of that art of his which 
Cicero pronounced incomparable, he 


 



felt that the sympathy of the audience 
was won, it would have been interesting, indeed, to have heard him argue 
point after point — clearly, brilliantly, 
wittily ; insulting the plaintiff in poetic 
terms; consigning him gracefully to 
the infernal regions; accentuating a 
fictitious and harmonious anger; drying his forehead without disarranging 
his hair; suffocating with the emotions he evoked; displaying real tears, 
and with them a knowledge, not only 
of law, rhetoric, philosophy, but of 
geometry, astronomy, ethics and the 
fine arts; blinding his hearers with the 
coruscations of his erudition; stirring 
them with his tongue, as with the point 
of a sword, until, as though abruptly 
possessed by an access of fury, he 
seized the plaintiff by the beard and 
sent him spinning like a leaf which 
the wind has caught. 

It would have bored no one either 



 



to have assisted at his triumph when 
he returned from Gaul, when he returned after Spain, after Pharsalus, 
when he returned from Cleopatra's 
arms. 

On that day the Via Sacra was curtained with silk. To the blare of 
twisted bugles there descended to it 
from the turning at the hill a troop of 
musicians garmented in leather tunics, 
bonneted with lions' heads. Behind 
them a hundred bulls, too fat to be 
troublesome, and decked for death, 
bellowed musingly at the sacrifants, 
who, naked to the waist, a long-handled hammer on the shoulder, maintained them with colored cords. To 
the rumble of wide wheels and the 
thunder of spectators the prodigious 
booty passed, and with it triumphs of 
war, vistas of conquered countries, 
pictures of battles, lists of the van- 
quished, symbols of cities that no 



 



longer were; a stretch of ivory on 
which shone three words, each begining with a V; images of gods dis- 
turbed, the Rhine, the Rhone, the 
captive Ocean in massive gold; the 
glitter of three thousand crowns 
offered to the dictator by the army 
and allies of Rome. Then came the 
standards of the republic, a swarm 
of eagles, the size of pigeons, in pol- 
ished silver upheld by lances which 
ensigns bore, preceding the six 
hundred senators who marched in a 
body, their togas bordered with red, 
while to the din of incessant insults, 
interminable files of prisoners passed, 
their wrists chained to iron collars, 
which held their heads very straight, 
and to the rear a litter, in which 
crouched the Vincegetorix of Gaul, a 
great moody giant, his menacing eyes 
nearly hidden in the tangles of his 
tawny hair. 



 



When they had gone the street was 
alive with explosions of brass, aflame 
with the burning red cloaks of laureled 
lictors making way for the coming 
of Caesar. Four horses, harnessed 
abreast, their manes dyed, their fore- 
locks puffed, drew a high and wonderfully jeweled car; and there, in the 
attributes and attitude of Jupiter 
Capitolinus, Csesar sat, blinking his 
tired eyes. His face and arms were 
painted vermilion; above the Tyrian 
purple of his toga, above the gold 
work and palms of his tunic, there 
oscillated a little ball in which there 
were charms against Envy. On his 
head a wreath concealed his increasing baldness; along his left arm the 
sceptre la}; behind him a boy admonished him noisily to remember he was 
man, while to the rear for miles and 
miles there rang the laugh of trumpets, 
the click of castanets, the shouts of 



 



dancers, the roar of the multitude, the 
tramp of legions, and the cry, caught 
up and repeated, "/o/ Trwmphe/" 

Presently, in the temple of the god 
of gods, side by side with the statue of 
Jupiter, Csesar found his own statue 
with " Caisar, demi-god," at its base. 
The captive chiefs disappeared in 
the Tullianum, and a herald called, 
"They have lived!" Through the 
squares jesters circulated, polyglot 
and obscene; in the circus the flower 
of the nobility held the reins; across 
the Tiber, in an artificial lake, the 
flotilla of Egypt fought against that 
of Tyr; in the amphitheatre there 
was a combat of soldiers, infantry 
against cavalry, one that indemnified 
those that had not seen the massacres 
in Thessaly and in Spain. There were 
public feasts, gifts to every one. 
Tables were set in the Forum, in the 
circuses and theatres. Falernian circulated in amphorse, Chius in barrels, 
When the populace was gorged there ' 
were the red feathers to enable it to 
gorge again. Intoxication knew no 
frontiers. In the arenas the gladiators died consoled. Of the Rome of 
Romulus there was nothing left save 
the gaunt she-wolf, her wide lips curled 
at the descendants of her nursling. 

Later, when in slippered feet Csesar 
wandered through those lovely gardens of his that lay beyond the Tiber, 
it may be that he recalled a dream 
which had come to him as a lad; one 
which concerned the submission of 
his mother; one which had disturbed 
him until the soothsayers said: "The 
mother you saw is the earth, and you 
will be her master." And as the 
memory of the dream returned, perhaps with it came the memory of the 
hour when as simple qutestor he had 
wept at Gaddir before a statue that 



 



was there. Demi-god, yes; he was 
that. More, even ; he was dictator, but 
the dream was unfulfilled. There were 
the depths of Hither Asia, the mysteries that lay beyond; there were the 
glimmering plains of the Caucasus; 
there were the Vistula and the Baltic; 
the diadems of Cyrus and of Alexander defying his ambition yet, and 
what were triumphs and divinity to 
one who would own the world! 

It was this that preoccupied him. 
The immensity of his successes seemed 
petty and Rome very small. Hereto- 
fore he had forgiven those who had 
opposed him. Presently his attitude 
changed, and so subtly that it was the 
more humiliating; it was not that he 
no longer forgave, he disdained to 
punish. His contempt was absolute. 
The senate made his office of pontifix maximus hereditary and accorded 
the title of I(pperator to his heirs. He 



 



snubbed tlie senate and the honors 
that it brought. The senate was 
shocked. Composed of men whose 
fortunes he had made, the senate was 
not only shocked, its education in in- 
gratitude was complete. Already 
there had been murmurs. Not con- 
tent with disarranging the calendar, 
outlining an empire, drafting a code 
while planning fresh beauties, new theatres, bi-lingual libraries, larger temples, grander gods, Ciesar was at work 
in the markets, in the kitchens of the 
gourmets, in the jewel-boxes of the 
virgins. Liberty, visibly, was taking 
flight. Besides, the power concentrated in him might be so pleasantly 
distributed. It was decided that 
Csesar was in the way. To put him 
out of it a pretext was necessary. 

One day the senate assembled at 
his command. They were to sign a 
decree creating him king. In order 



 



not to, Suetonius says, they killed him, 
wounding each other in the effort, for 
Caesar fought Hke the demon that he 
was, desisting only when he recognized Brutus, to whom, in Greek, he 
muttered a reproach, and, draping his 
toga that he might fall with decency, 
fell backward, his head covered, a
