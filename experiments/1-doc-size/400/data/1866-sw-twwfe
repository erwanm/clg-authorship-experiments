the Bible as carrying on the caravan trade between Persia 
and Palestine ; bringing the rich wares of that region and 
perhaps also of southern Arabia to the markets of Tyre and 
Sidon. It is certain that the children of Keturah stretched 
across the country between the head of the Arabian gulf and 
that of the Persian gulf ; and they intermarried of course 
with other tribes, — Ishmaelite certainly, and maybe in this 
case Cushite." 

"Then the Dedan and Sheba that lived in the desert could 
help the others that lived by the sea," said Daniel ; " they 
coidd furnish them with camels and guides, as the Arabs do 
now for the caravans to Mecca," 

"Ay, but it is not certain," said uncle Sam. "Only 
this is certain ; that tribes bearing the names of Sheba and 
Dedan, and Eaamah the father of the Cushite Dedan, did 
carry on that caravan trade between India and Palestine. 
Ezekiel speaks of them in mentioning the traffic of Tyro, 
'Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots' 
— that might have been Babylonian or Persian work; in 
those regions the people were early famous for rich stuffs 



and dothing. ' The merchants of Sheba and Kaamah, they 
were thy merchants ; they occupied in thy fairs with chid
of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.' And 
at the same time Jeremiah speaks of Dedan as an Arab tribe 
living on the borders of Edom. ' Flee ye, turn back, dwell 
deep, O inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity 
of Esau upon him, the time that I Tisit Jbim.' That is the 
way, you know, an Arab tribe can do when hard pressed by 
an enemy, or in danger—' flee, turn back, and dwell deep'— 
they can go back into the depths of their wildernesses and 
waste places, where nobody can follow them but one that 
knows how, and that can live as they live." 

"The queen of Sheba brought gold, too," I said. 

" Ah, that was another Sheba, my little Tiny. That was 
the great kingdom established in the south and west of 
Arabia by the sons of Joktan the son of Eber. They overran 
the Cushites who had settled there — don't you remember ? — 
and established a great and powerful kingdom which was 
such for many hundred years. From Mecca on the western 
coast, down south and east and far inland. Sheba was the 
principal tribe among Joktan's sons, and gave name to the 
kingdom for a very long time; and from there came the 
famous queen who was so puzzled about Solomon. Ophir 
was another of Joktan's sons ; Havilah was another. You 
must not confound this great kingdom with the merchant 
tribe settled on the Persian gulf, or the Arab tribe, sons of 
Keturah, pasturing their camels on the borders of Syria." 

" I understand now," I said ; " but, uncle Sam, it is a little 
hard to remember all these names." 

" Till we get to know them," said uncle Sam. " There is 
an interest about the name of Shuah, from the fact that 
Job's friend Bildad was a Shuhite. Job himself, you know, 
was the greatest of all the men of the east. He lived in 
that 'east country.' Eliphaz was a Temanite. But the 
Midianites you must ieJI remember. We hear of them often 
enough." 

" I do," said lipL " I remember." 

" I don't much," said Priscilla. 




"You will, if we go on. The Midianites, in Bible language, 
meant just about the same thing that we mean when we speak 
of the Arabs. They were Arabians; they had the desert 
country lying north of the peninsula of Sinai ; and they even 
took their flocks down into the peninsula, when need was and 
they could find pasture there, so that it too was sometimes 
called the 4and of Midian.' The Midianites were the most 
powerful of the northern Arabian tribes ; so very naturally 
their name came to be taken (it is supposed) to stand for the 
whole northern Arabs generally, whether Ishmaelite or Ketu- 
rahite. Midian you may understand as meaning all the pos- 
sessors of the Egyptian and northern deserts— and those 
deserts would be the ' land of Midian.' And they were regular 
Bedouin. They lived as Bedouin Arabs do; mostly in tents ; 
though there was a city of Midian on the eastern shore of 
the Arabian gulf. From that point northwards and spread- 
ing east and west, was the real land of the Midianites. They 
roved about with their flocks and herds and camels without 
number, as the Bedouin do now ; they were warlike enough 
you know, if you recollect Bible history ; and they were just 
as fond of ornaments and wore them as abundantly as the 
Arab women do. That is, or was, Midian." 

" They plagued the Israelites very much, didn't they, uncle 
Sam, afterwards ? " 

"Very much; they fought them, oppressed them, and 
they led them into sin. It was a caravan of Midianite mer- 
chants that bought Joseph and sold him into Egypt. The 
sheikhs of the Midianites went with the Moabite messengers 
to persuade Balaam to come and curse Israel. Then the 
Midianites later led the Israelites into idolatry, through the 
enticements of Midianitish women, and brought a great 
plague upon the people. And in the time of Gideon they 
overran Israel for years together. They came up into the 
land when the harvests were ripe and swept it of everything; 
left the people nothing to live upon, neither ox nor ass nor 
sheep. For they came with the Amalekites and the children 
of the east generally to help them, and both they and their 
camels were without number, the Word says ; they made a 



 

dean sweep, quite across to Gaza, and deToured the land. 
For seven years Israel groaned under them." 

" If Isaac had known,' said liph, "how much znischief his 
brother Midian would do ! " 

" All the fault of the Israelites though, as you will see" 
said my uncle. 

" It seems so strange," I said, " that the Midianites should 
have been children of Abraham." 

"They dnd the Ishmaelites too," said my uncle. "The 
children of Keturah.and of Hagar inhabited those regions of 
the east country and the wilderness together ; and we may 
as well look at them together. Kedar and Tema were the 
most noted and oftenest named tribes of Ishmael towards 
the west. Up north-west of the peninsula of Sinai, up 
towards the boundaries of Palestine, their portion lay ; and 
there it remained for many a day; perhaps remains still 
On the borders of Syria there is a small town yet bearing the 
name of Teynia, and another not far off called Doomat-el- 
JendeL That is for Dumah, you see, another son of IshmaeL 
At both places there are remains of old fortresses ; both 
places were on the grand highway of the Damascus pilgrim 
caravan, and those fortresses were built for its protection. 
So there are two names of the sons of Ishmael still known 
'by their towns and by their castles,' or fortified places; and 
the others might be made out perhaps, if travellers had gone 
that way and given time and attention to the search. And 
near these two old places is the country of Keydr — that is 
the Kedar of the Bible. So you see how round the future 
land and territory of Israel their future enemies were already 
preparing. Kedar was a great tribe, and very likely under 
its name were included other less important tribes. Of the 
rest of Ishmael's sons we know very little ; but the whole 
western desert was covered with the black tents of Kedar." 

"How can you tell and be sure they were black, uncle 
Sam?" 

"The Bible says, in a certain place, 'I am black, but 
comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar.' 
That is in the Song of Solomon." 


"I should not think they would be 'comely, " said Dan ; 
" not like our white tents." 

''Arab tents are, though. See them in the right place, 
with the light striking across them in a sunny desert, or 
touching them up in a mountain hollow— yes, they look well 
And we might almost know the tents of Kedar were of the 
same sort, if we were not told ; the Ishmaelites of the present 
day do so exactly what their fathers did, in every point that 
comes to our knowledge. Dr Eobinson noticed when he was 
in the desert, that several of the Arabs of his party, and 
others whom he saw with camels, carried a particular sort of 
stick or crook, about three feet long, with a crook to one 
end and the head brought down parallel with the stick and 
cut in a certain peculiar shape. Well, boys, the very same 
stick, the very same crook with its peculiar shape, is found 
represented on the walls of temples in the ruins of Thebes ; 
shown in the hands of figures cut in the rock. And Thebes 
was destroyed by Cambyses five hundred years before Christ; 
that is, between two and three thousand years ago ; and the 
Arabs carry the same stick still" 

" Things do not last so in our country," said Daniel 

"We are the children of Japheth,"d my unda "The 
tribes of Kedar and Tema were true Arabs in other things 
besides their tents of goat's hair. They were pastonil tribes, 
we know; keepers of flocks; for Ezekiel says they were 
merchants in the markets of Tjrre — Arabia and all the princes 
of Kedar — ' in lambs, and rams, and goats ; ' and Jeremiah 
speaks of their possessions and way of life in his threat of 
their overthrow: 'Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoU the 
men of the east. Their tents and their flocks shall they 
take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains, and 
all their vessels, and their camels.' Nebuchadrezzar was to 
do this. And there is another beautiful mention of Kedar. - 
Though they wandered about in tents, yet being so great and 
powerful a tribe they had also some settled towns or dwelling-places. Isaiah speaks of ' the glory of Kedar — the number of archers— the mighty men of tho children of Kedar.' 
And then, when he is foretelling the coming of Christ and 



 

His salvation — do you remember, mother — he breaks forth 
— ' Sing nnto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the 
end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is 
therein ; the isles and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages 
that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock 
sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let 
them give glory imto the Lord, and declare his praise in the 
islands.'" 

" But Kedar didn't," said L 

" Kedar will For in this glorious prophecy which tells 
us of the spread and increase of the Church in later times, 
Isaiah speaks of them by name. ' The abundance of the sea 
shaU be converted unto thee, the wealth of the Gentiles shall 
come unto thee. The multitude of camels shall cover thee, 
the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba 
shall come ; they shall bring gold and incense ; and they 
shall show forth the praises of the Lord. All the flocks of 
Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of 
Nabaioth shall minister unto thee : they shall come up with 
acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my 
glory.'" 

"Midian, tool" said L 

" Ay, Midian, and Ephah whom we scarcely hear of, and 
Nebaioth whose descendants we hardly know. Men may 
not know them, but the Lord will gather them, even the 
wild sons of those wild people. Kedar from the western 
desert, and Sheba from the utmost borders of Arabia in the 
soutL ' Who are these that fly as a doud, and as the doves 
to their windows ? " 

" Abraham did not see any of the trouble among his sons, 
uncle Sam." 

" Not any. He sent Keturah's children away into the east 
country, where they would not, he thought, make any trouble 
for Isaac. Pe gave all he had unto Isaac; and then, 'in 
full age, like as a shock of com cometh in his season,' he 
died ; ' an old man and full of years ;' very glad, no doubt, 
to go to that country he had been looking for, and to 




receive in his own person that promise of eternal inheritance." 

" What does it mean, uncle Sam, that 'he was gathered to 
his fathers?" 

"Don't you know, Tinyl He went to join the company 
to which he belonged, of those who had gone before him
Don't you know ? — 

' One army of the living Grod, 

To Hia command we bow ; 
Part of the host have oross'd the flood, 
And part are crossing now. 

' E'en now by faith we join our hands 

With those that went before ; 
And greet the blood-besprinkled bands 
On the eternal shore.' " 

"So Abraham went. And then there was a wonderful 
funeral ; for they came to lay to rest the remains of the man 
who had been the 'friend of God.' Isaac, the heir of the 
promises, came from BeeMahai-roi ; and Ishmael, the elder 
brother, came from his wild life in the wilderuess ; and together the two very different sons of this man buried him in 
the cave of Machpelah, where Sarah had been laid nearly 
forty years before ; where, I suppose, their dust rests at this 
day. In that way, too. Tiny, Abraham was gathered to his 
people ; for there is an eternal procession of  dust to dust.' " 

" Is that all, uncle Sam ?' 

" There is not much more. It is very likely that the two 
brothers never met again after this time. Ishmael lived 
forty-eight years longer in the wilderness of Paran or the 
east country ; his twelve sons spread themselves ' from 
Havilah unto Shur ; ' settled along the country as far as the 
Persian Gulf ; mixing more or less with the Midianites and 
Moabites, and all the children of the east, growing powerful and strong, and fixing their wild character more and 
more. And Isaac fed his flocks in Gerar, and never had anything wild about him but his son Esau. Esau was a little 
tired." 



 

''And that is all about Abraham." 

'' About all that the Bible tells us. It was foretold him, 
you remember, that his seed should be as the stars of heaven 
for multitude Now see how this word was fulfilled. Firsts 
there are the Israelites, the children of Isaac. How many 
they are at this day it is impossible to guess. They are 
scattered in every land, but not lost; in every land they 
keep themselves distinct, a separate people ; never merged 
in the nation where their abode is. When their time comes, 
they will appear a great host, out of nearly all the lands of 
the earth. 

" Second, there are the Ishmaelites ; the Arabian nation. 
I do not know what their numbers may be. Their language, 
the Arabic, as I told you, is spoken by a hundred and twenty 
millions of people. In the north of Africa, in Egypt, through 
all Syria in the great country of Arabia and roaming all 
through Mesopotamia and Chaldea, there the children of 
Ishmael are at this day ; wild men ; so truly wild, that they 
disdain those of their people who have settled in towns and 
villages, and hold them an inferior race; which in truth they 
are. 

"Then there were the Midianites; a very great nation in 
their day. And there were Esau's children, the Edomites ; 
along with all the mixed tribes of ike Bene-Kedem, the children of the East, who more or less directly may be traced 
from Abraham. By these various peoples the name of 
Abraham is known through all Asia. ' El-KhuUL' " 

" There are no Midianites, now, uncle Sam ? " 

" None that are called such." 

" Nor Edomites, nor Kedar ? " 

"No. The country or district of Keydfir there is. All 
those tribes, all their mingled names, have come down to us 
in the great nation of the Arabs. They and the Jews are the 
children of Abraham now living." 

"Uncle Sam, do the Arabs believe what the Jews believed" 

" In religion ? Oh no, Tiny. In the first place, the Arabian 
people were idolaters. They had a religion of what is called 




fetishism ; they worshipped trees, and stones, and stars, and 
the powers of nature ; and they were exceedingly debased
though not brutish lie savages. They cultivated poetry 
and language, at the same time that they worshipped their 
idols round the Kaabeh, at Mecca, with horrid ceremonies. 
There was a little corrupt Christianity among them, and 
some Judaism ; and that was all, till Mohammed arose and 
converted the whole nation to his faith. They are all Mohammedans since that time." 

" What is that, uncle Sam ? " 

" Mohammedans ? They believe there is but one God, and 
they abhor all idols ; so far they are right But they believe that the Lord Jesus was only a great prophet, the 
greatest that had appeared before Mohammed himself ; a 
little greater than Moses, and Abraham, and Noah. So they 
know nothing of salvation by the blood of Christ, and depend 
only on good works ; one of which is killing an infidel, and 
another is prayer." 

" How did Mohammed get them all to believe that way ?' 

" Partly by the terror of the sword, Tiny ; partly by the 
power of his own persuasions and energetic nature.'' 

" And how long is that ago ? " 

" More than twelve hundred years." 

" And they are all Mohammedans ? " 

" All the Arabian nation, along with other neighbouring 
nations. Yes, they are fiercely Mohammedan, though not 
very religious. Tiny. They despise and dislike both Jews 
and Christians ; at the same time that they pay very little 
attention to the commands of their own prophet. Some of 
the Bedouin sheikhs comply with the Moslem customs of 
prayer when they go into a town, just to secure respect to 
themselves. The common Arabs give themselves very little 
concern about praying at all. There is a kind of puritan 
sect among them, the Wahabys, who try to bring the rest to 
more faithful observance of the laws of Mohammed; but 
they are mainly successful by the power of the sword, I 
fancy where they are successful at afl." 

" So Abraham's children are all gone wrong," I said. 



" Isaac went right We will talk about him, I hope, one
