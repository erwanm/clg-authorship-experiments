it with all thy might.' " 

" If it is the right whatsoever," appends Armitage. He, 
too, has theories, and he has come here hoping to do a good 
work, since no one could accuse him of seeking either posi- 
tion or emoluments. Yet he finds himself curiously at loss 
sometimes. 

After they have gone over all the questions, and settled 
to view the land of their promise to-morrow, Alice turns to 
the piano and plays some of the quaint old hymns, and 
they all sing, simply for their own pleasure. Mrs. Prall 
comes to the kitchen window and listens. 

" I declare for it, that's jest like a little bit of heaven !" 
leaning her arms on the sill and looking at Lois. " They 
do sing so satisfyin' like, . with no flourishes or drawlin's, 
and runnin' over words time and agin, till you kin hardly 
tell what 'twas at first. And that young minister is such 
a nice appearin' man. I'd like to hear him preach, but they 
do say he ain't very sound in the faith." 

Lois gives her favorite sign of contempt. 

" My opinion is, some of 'em won't be found very sound 
in works when they come to be weighed in the balance at 
the last ; ev'n with all their faith thrown in." 

"You do have some queer idees. Mis' Strong. Paith's 
faith, an' there ain't no gettin' round it." 

Mrs. Prall always comes back to first principles, whether 
her controversies are long or short. 

Winterburne walks down the road with his friend for 
some distance. .He likes Armitage, for he discerns a fine 
honor and great tenderness under the formalisms in whibh 
he has been trained, and an earnest desire to do some work 
for the poor and neglected. He has sounded old Mr. Pur- 
vis, and found that his radical ideas rathfer shocked the 
slow-going man, who leaves a great deal to what he calls 



 

an overruling Providence, and considers his duty done in 
plentiful exhorta.tions. There must be some one to keep 
liim in countenance, and he has thus settled upon the 
younger man. 

' "Armitage," he says as they are parting, "when you 
think there is a real call for something new in the way of 
a church building, when your place gets too strait, you are 
to let me know, if I don't find it out for myself. Heaven 
speed you, my friend. There is plenty of room for all 
kinds of work in this world." 

Cynthia is still loitering on the porch, and gives Winter- 
burne a bright smile with her good-night. Ah, if he only 
were Jasper ! If they could have him, with liis hearty, 
wholesome interest in all things. She does so enjoy a pur- 
pose, even in rather trivial concerns. 

Every day she and Miss Hilliard go about the town a 
little. There are some sick people, some old folks neg- 
lected by their kind, to -whom a touch of good cheer is 
better even than the sunshine. And the next day they 
go slowly through Main Street. The lower end by the 
mills is inexpressibly vile, with beer-shops in every square. 
Then it becomes a little deeenter, with better-class houses, 
though they are untidy enough, with their broken fences, 
their chickens and geese and pigs. And here is the corner, 
a great bare spot with a diagonal path across it, and the 
scanty herbage hipped close even where it has bad the 
courage to grow. 

" I do think I'd like it farther out," says Miss Hilliard. 
" But it wouldn't be so central, and Norman's theory is, that 
you must go to meet these people; that they will rarely 
come to you. That isn't the generally received opinion. 
Most people stand on guard, they are so afraid of some one 
crowding in." 

Gynthia smiles, mostly to herself. All this is so differ- 
ent from her life hitherto, this poverty is unlike anything 
in their brief experience. How Regina would shrink in 
disgust ! yet in some respects Miss Hilliard is quite as fas- 
tidious, quite as neat in her personal care and surroundings. 





Cyntliia feels so at home with her, and is continually gath- 
ering up new ideas of the rightful purposes of living. 
Each day deepens her regard for Wiuterburne. She can 
hardly believe he is the same young fellow who used to 
drop in their little parlor and talk quietly to their mother, 
or puzzle himself over the nonsensical chatter in which 
she and Perdita indulged. Why, it might be in some other 
life, it seems so far off, so unreal. 

Two days after Winterburne brings home a plan of 
the building, arranged by a practised hand, — a young car- 
penter, who fias taken hold of the idea with an enthusiasm 
that surprises him. This Mr. Eadmer is to negotiate for 
the property at once, and commence the building as soon 
as the specifications are properly concluded. 

"Why, Mr. Winterburne," he declares, "you will be the 
redemption of the place. No one has seemed to care for 
its advancement. All the towns around us have improved, 
but when a man made some money here, he went off else- 
where and spent it. And there has been lots of money 
made, only it's always been kept in a few hands, and they 
had no real interest in the town. And it's queer that you, 
who will be a rich man in a few years, a stranger too, 
should concern yourself about us. What luck you've had 
at Hazens ! I suppose it's true ? No danger of the vein 
giving out ? " 

" There'll be a good deal of it before it does give out," 
answers Winterburne. " For more than a hundred yards 
it shows no sign of diminution in width, and will be surface 
working, the most inexpensive of all. So I think it ought 
to do something for its country's good. It brings with it 
an obligation." 

" Ah, but most men wouldn't think so ; " and Eadmer 
studies this new specimen before him with unusual interest. 
There is something quite fascinating in his eager, whole- 
some vigor, a compelling power that seems to challenge 
any kindred spirit to its best, a belief in his own capacity 
to bring about certain issues. And since money is the 
great factor, why should he not believe and do, when it has 



 

been the dream of his life, and he has attained to the com- 
petence necessary without any effort on his part ? 

There is a curious undercurrent in the man's soul, urging 
him on the more rapidly, that in some natures would par- 
take of superstition. He will not begin by self-aggrandize- 
ment. He means presently to try again for that greater 
prize, and he wants clean hands as well as an honest soul. 
If he has desired riches for her, he will not traverse any 
point he has heretofore considered a duty. 

He is so interested in Eadmer that he insists upon 
Armitage making his acquaintance. He can foresee that 
the young clergyman, with his high ideals, will have hard, 
up-hill work, and no doubt become deeply discouraged be- 
fore he makes any headway. He has seen the glory of 
these sublime truths he means to teach, in such a wondrous 
light ; they have so flooded his soul, that he will not be able 
at first to understand the obtuseness, the indifference, of a 
people like these. His fastidious, conservative fibres have 
been strengthened by his scholastic training, and his own 
belief has met with but few strains. To him a "thus saitli 
the Lord" is sufficient. But he has gone down deep in 
the divine love, while to most of these people religion 
seems a sort of tradition their fathers and mothers have 
settled for them, and that they have accepted complacently. 
With others there is a curious hostility, a sort of alertness 
in their defences, as if they might be unwittingly captured 
if they were found off guard. Then there are the prosaic 
indifference, the utter blankness, the habit of letting the 
present suffice. Heaven seems a long way off and a little 
uncertain, but the present needs are real and pressing. 

Kadmer has always been here as boy and man, and under- 
stands the prejudices of the people. He can in certain 
ways be of great assistance to Armitage, and, though the 
companionship may not be as satisfying as that he finds 
out to the old Prall house where he has already become a 
frequent visitor, it will be quite as important. 

" What's this I hear ? " asks Dale one afternoon, when 
Winterburne has come in from a day spent at the minci 





" You have begun early to waste your substanoe on the 
town. Are you quite sure an addition to the poorhouse 
wouldn't have been better ? Some old folks do find their 
way thither, but what are you going to do with a town 
hall ? give public concerts ? " 

" Yes. Gather up the musical talent of the place. There 
are several quite spirited fiddlers, I have observed, and a 
cornet player, besides a drum corps. Why, we might give 
quite a concert. Then a strolling lecturer might happen 
, along, a debating society could be formed. There are no 
end of purposes for which it would be available."- And 
Winterburne smiles with cordial brightness. 

''See here/' says Dale, squaring his small figure in a 
rather belligerent fashion, " you're young yet, Winterburne. 
You've had some uncommon luck, — enough to turn any 
one's head, and I've remarked yours is pretty level. Don't 
get affronted at what I'm going to say. Just think that 
I'm old enough to be your father — if I'd begun life early 
as some men ; " and he gives an abrupt little chuckle. " My 
advice to you is to look out for yourself. Let some of the 
big men with their millions come back and endow their 
native towns, but don't you throw away your money be- 
fore it's fairly begun to come in. If this town is dying 
for a hall or anything, let public spirit join and build it, 
and keep it. There's nothing to be done in a little i)lace 
like this. And you young fellows nowadays get your 
heads so full of socialistic projects ! When you go off on 
that train there's no telling where you will bring up. 
There, I haven't done you a mite of good, but I've had my 
say ! That young parson, I s'pose, has got hold of you, and 
he'll count for more'n any ten other men." 

" No ; I think it's the other way — I've impressed him. 
You see. Dale, I'm a plain sort of fellow myself, and just 
at present my expenses are very moderate. I could spend 
all this will cost on a year's living. Perhaps no one would 
consider it very extravagant ; " and he glances steadily at 
the other. 

"No, they wouldn't Only it would look a little too 



 

previous, — as if you couldn't wait for the splurge ! But 
I'll tell you, Winterburne, there's no power on earth like 
money. I've been through the mill, ground up pretty close 
once or twice. Good Lord ! if I had your chance, five or 
six years from this time I'd be one of the big men in the 
State. Business is right at the top round now, and the 
swells begin to go down in two or three years. Of course 
you'll have your mine — if it doesn't come to an end; " and 
he gives a short chuckle ; " but prices are first class, and 
everything is going with a rush. Now is your time to 
save money, and make paying investments. Money makes 
money enough sight faster than labor. You keep clear of 
these philanthropical fandangoes ; they always lead a man 
a pretty dance, and he's mighty likely to come home bare- 
footed. See here, I go to church pretty regular, though I 
don't believe as much as I did years ago; but I read my 
Bible. It's a book with lots of common-sense in it. And 
here's a text I commend to you ; it's good, sound advice : 
' And men will pra,ise thee when thou doest well unto 
thyself.' When they leave off praising and begin to blame, 
you're not of much account. You don't carry any weight 
in the places where real, unadulterated business heft would 
help you. And when once you get going down-hill there's 
mighty little to catch hold of. People sheer to one side ; 
but I've noticed that when you're most up to the top there's 
lots standing ready to give you a boost. You just hustle 
up to the top, then begin with your halls and your libraries 
and your homes for old folks, and you'll find yourself swim- 
ming right into favor. The very people you want to 
benefit will pay more attention to you. I've had twenty 
years more experience than you." 

Dale's face settles into the self-consciousness that seems 
to be born of the experience upon which he lays such stress, 
and is quite sure it enables him to be a competent judge. 
That it has been within extremely narrow lines makes no 
difference in liis estimation. Certain methods bring about 
certain results in England, Japan, or America. 

" I've studied up on the question too, but I can't 





think that conclusion the best," says Winterburne gently. 
" Everybody has a fling at Warwick, but has any Qne tried 
his hand at mending ? The town authorities don't even 
attend to their work. Property is so poor it can't stand 
enough taxation to improve anything. Manufacturing 
towns don't need to be the oif-scourings of creation. Look 
at the history of some of them that have blossomed into 
promising and successful cities.' But you have to create a' 
desire for advancement, to waken an ambition for the 
possession of material things, something that can belong 
to the individual. Count up the many beautiful places 
that have come into existence by a dozen or twenty people 
buying a bit of land, and building homes for themselves. 
Their satisfaction won others. Then business came in. 
There's no earthly reason why Warwick should be such a 
forlorn place after thirty years of existence." 

" Well," responds Dale doggedly, " I'm not going to put 
any money in it. I give you fair warning ! I'm too old to 
try any fool experiments. I've set ray eyes on a pretty 
piece of land at Cedar Grove, and the first money I have to 
spare I shall spend in making a comfortable home for my 
old age. Our ancient hut isn't worth repairing, and it 
doesn't look any better to me because generations of Dales 
have lived and died in it. 'Twas all right enough then, 
but business has crowded up too close, and I'm going to get 
out to something I can enjoy. Now, if you had a mind to 
put money in that, and come up there, you and your sister, 
and some of the best people here, we'd soon have a nice 
settlement." 

" And leave Warwick to go to the dogs ? " Winterburne 
nods with an amused sort of inquiry. 

" Well, they're a brutish lot anyhow. Iron workers in 
these places always are. All they want is beer and whiskey 
and tobacco. What's the use of stirring them up ? They 
won't make any better workers. Just as soon as you fill 'em 
.up with new wants, there's the very devil to pay in strikes 
and troubles generally. Can't you let well enough alone ? " 

Dale is losing his temper. They are leading off so 



& 

splendidly. Orders are pouring in upon them, their iron is 
of. so line a quality, and now seems a chance for fortune- 
making — the thing that has so far eluded Dale in spite of 
several fair outlooks. To have this young fellow upset 
things generally in the vain endeavor to raise these people 
wlio are content, and don't care to be advanced, is the 
maddest folly. Then, they are mostly foreigners. He 
puts this to Winterburne as one of the strongest argu- 
ments. 

" You forget that their children are going to be our citi- 
zens and legislators presently. They must have some 
training, or in time to come the better classes, as they are 
called, will be the sufferers. But I do not believe my one 
hall or reading-room will stir up an insurrection. And 
then I shall have some money back of me, so the business 
will not suffer." 

" You're a queer compound, Winterburne, and there'd be 
no sense in us three fellows getting cross-grained," he says 
after a little thought. For though they took this smart 
young fellow in at first for the sake, of his process and his 
undoubted business capacity, he is now, or soon will be, the 
moneyed man of the firm. And if the luck is on his side, 
he may even engineer his way through with the workmen, 
with whom he is a favorite already. Dale has settled to 
his beliefs after what he always terms his years of expe- 
rience, and he is confident that he is right. 

" Yes ; we must pull the same stroke," says Winterburne 
with his pleasant laugh, turning away. He has the larger 
patience of wider reading and more recent methods of edu- 
cation. He has seen life under more varied aspects than 
his compeer of half a century. 







CHAPTER XIV 

IN A NET 


Events go on much as usual at Bradley House. Eegina 
is in great demand for society pleasures. She fits into this 
niche so admirably, she adorns it with a subtle grace, she 
is so harmoniously adjusted to all the minor chords, which 
are struck more frequently than the great, grand ones. 
Mount Sardis comes down to Beverly in exquisite array to 
luncheons and lawn parties. There is a very flattering 
strife for Miss Halford. True, there are some pretty girls, 
some attractive young married women, some charming 
elderly ladies, but she is the rare blossom of the town. 
She is not haughty, but you know she could be ; she has an 
elegant graciousness that propitiates at once : the result of 
fine perception rather than affluent culture. And in a cer- 
tain charming sense she pays back with a fastidious inde- 
pendence, so that there is nothing grasping or selfish about 
her outward demeanor. It is the air of always having been 
just where she is, the consciousness that there can be no 
surprises to mar the harmony. 

She has taken much pains to come up to this standard. 
She has made it so much a part of her being that she 
never even to herself acts a part, because she so thoroughly 
enjoys it all. 

Jasper is not necessarily her attendant. Eegina has 
many attractions for the opposite sex as well, and there is a 
strand of jealousy in Jasper not quite to her fancy. Then,
