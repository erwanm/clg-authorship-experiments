" Well how did he do ?" 

" Perfectly well — I believe he is a good little fellow. I 







wanted to satisfy myself if he was fit to be trusted with you ; 
and I rather think Mr. Marshman has taken care of that." 

The whole wall of trees was in shadow when the little family 
sat down to table ; but there was still the sun-lit picture behind ; and there was another kind of sunshine in every face 
at the table. Quietly happy the whole four, or at least this
whole three, were ; first, in being together, — after that, in all 
things beside. Never was tea so refreshing, or bread and 
butter so sweet, or the song of birds so delightsome. When 
the birds were gone to their nests, the cricket and grasshop- 
per and tree-toad and katy-did, and nameless other songsters, 
kept up a concert, — nature's own, — in delicious harmony with 
woods and flowers and summer breezes and evening light. 
Ellen's cup of enjoyment was running over. From one beautiful thing to another her eye wandered, — from one joy to 
another her thoughts went, — till her full heart fixed on the 
God who had made and given them all, and that Redeemer 
whose blood had been their purchase-money. From the dear 
friends beside her, the best-loved she had in the world, she 
thought of the one dearer yet from whom death had separated her ; — yet living still, — and to whom death would restore 
her, thanks to Him who had burst the bonds of death and 
broken the gates of the grave, and made a way for his ransomed to pass over. And the thought of Him was the joy- 
fullest of all ! 

"You look happy, Ellie," said her adopted brother. 

" So I am," said Ellen, smiling a very bright smile. 

" What are you thinking about ?" — 

But John saw it would not do to press his question. 

" You remind me," said he, "of some old fairy story that 
my childish ears received, in which the fountains of the sweet 
and bitter waters of life were said to stand very near each 
other, and to mingle their streams but a little way from their 
source. Your tears and smiles seem to be brothers and sisters ; — whenever we see one we may be sure the other is not 
far off." 

" My dear Jack !" said Alice laughing, — what an unhappy 
simile ! Are brothers and sisters always found like that ?" 

" I wish they were," said John sighing and smiling ; — " but 
my last words had nothing to do with my simile as you call it." 







When tea was over, and Margery had withdrawn the 
things and taken away the table, they still lingered in their 
places. It was far too pleasant to go in. Mr. Humphreys 
moved his chair to the side of the house, and thiowing a 
handkerchief over his head to defend him from the mosquitoes, a few of which were buzzing about, he either 
listened, meditated, or slept ; — most probably one of the two 
latter ; for the conversation was not very loud nor very lively ; 
it was happiness enough merely to breathe so near each other. 
The sun left the distant fields and hills ; soft twilight stole 
through the woods, down the gap, and over the plain ; the 
grass lost its green ; the wall of trees grew dark and dusky ; 
and very faint and dim showed the picture that was so bright 
a little while ago. As they sat quite silent, listening to what 
nature had to say to them, or letting fancy and memory take 
their way, the silence was broken — hardly broken — by the 
distinct far-off cry of a whip-poor-will. Alice grasped her 
brother's arm, and they remained motionless, while it came 
nearer, nearer, — then quite near, — with its clear, wild, shrill, 
melancholy note sounding close by them again and again, — 
strangely, plaintively, — then leaving the lawn, it was heard 
further and further off, till the last faint " whip-poor-will," in 
the far distance, ended its pretty interlude. It was almost 
too dark to read faces, but the eyes of the brother and sister 
had sought each other and remained fixed till the bird was 
out of hearing ; then Alice's hand was removed to his, and 
her head found its old place on her brother's shoulder. 

" Sometimes John," said Alice, " I am afraid I have one 
tie too strong to this world. I cannot bear — as I ought — to 
have you away from me." 

Her brother's lips were instantly pressed to her forehead. 

" I may say to you Alice, as Col. Gardiner said to his wife, 
' we have an eternity to spend together !' " 

I wonder," said Alice after a pause, — " how those can 
bear to love or be loved, whose affection can see nothing but 
a blank beyond the grave." 

" Few people, I believe," said her brother, " would come 
exactly under that description ; most flatter themselves with 
a vague hope of reunion after death," 

" But that is a miserable hope — very different from ours." 

" Very different indeed I — and miserable ; for it can only 





deceive ; but ours is sure. * Them that sleep in Jesus will 
God bring with him.' " 

" Precious !" said Alice. " How exactly fitted to every 
want and mood of the mind are the sweet Bible words." 

" Well !" said Mr. Humphreys, rousing himself, — " I am 
going in! These mosquitoes have half eaten me up. Are 
you going to sit there all night?" 

" We are thinking of it, papa," said Alice cheerfully. 

He went in, and was heard calling Margery for a light. 

They had better lights on the lawn. The stars began to 
peep out through the soft blue, and as the blue grew deeper 
they came out more and brighter, till all heaven was hung 
with lamps. But that was not all. In the eastern horizon, 
just above the low hills that bordered the far side of the 
plain, a white light, spreading and growing and brightening, 
promised the moon, and promised that she would rise very 
splendid ; and even before she came began to throw a faint 
lustre over the landscape. All eyes were fastened, and 
exclamations burst, as the first silver edge showed itself, and 
the moon rapidly rising looked on them with her whole broad 
bright face ; lighting up not only their faces and figures but 
the wide country view that was spread out below, and touching most beautifully the trees in the edge of the gap, and 
faintly the lawn ; while the wall of wood stood in deeper and 
blacker shadow than ever. 

Isn't that beautiful !" said Ellen. 

" Come round here, Ellie," said John ; — " Alice may have 
you all the rest of the year, but when I am at home you 
belong to me. What was your little head busied upon a while 
ago?" 

When ?" said Ellen. 

" When I asked you " — 

I know, — I remember. I was thinking " — 
"Well?"— 

" I was thinking — do you want me to tell you ?" 
"Unless you would rather not." 

I was thinkino: about Jesus Christ," said Ellen in a low 
tone. 

" What about him, dear Ellie ?" said her brother, drawing 
her closer to his side. 

" Different things, — I was thinking of what he said about 







little children, — and about what he said, you know, — ' In my 
Father's house are many mansions — and I was thinking that 
mamma was there ; and I thought — that we all " — 
Ellen could get no further. 

" ' He that believeth in him shall not be ashamed,' " said 
John softly. " ' This is the promise that he hath promised 
us, even eternal life ; and who shall separate us from the love 
of Christ ? Not death, nor things present, nor things to 
come. But he that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself 
even as he is pure ;' — let us remember that too." 

" Mr. John," said Ellen presently, — " don't you like some 
of the chapters in the Revelation very much ?" 
Yes — very much. Why ? — do you ?" 

" Yes. I remember reading parts of them to mamma, and 
that is one reason, I suppose ; but I like them very much. 
There is a great deal I can't understand, though." 

" There is nothing finer in the Bible than parts of that 
book," said Alice. 

" Mr. John," said Ellen, — " what is meant by the * white 
stone ?* " 

" ' And in the stone a new name written ?' " — 
Yes — that I mean." 

Mr. Baxter says it is the sense of God's love in the 
heart ; and indeed that is it ' which no man knoweth saving 
him that receiveth it.' This, I take it, Ellen, was Christian's 
certificate, which he used to comfort himself with reading in, 
you remember ?" 

" Can a child have it ?" said Ellen thoughtfully. 

" Certainly — many children have had it — you may have it. 
Only seek it faithfully. ' Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and 
worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy 
ways.' — And Christ said, ' he that loveth me shall be loved of 
my Father, and I will love him, and I will manifest myself to 
him !' There is no failure in these promises, Ellie ; he that 
made them is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever." 

For a little while each was busy with his own meditations. 
The moon meanwhile, rising higher and higher, poured a 
flood of light through the gap in the woods before them, and 
stealing among the trees here and there lit up a spot of ground 
under their deep shadow. The distant picture lay in mazy 
brightness. All was still, but the ceaseless chirrup of insects 




and gentle flapping of leaves ; the summer air just touched 
their cheeks with the lightest breath of a kiss, sweet from 
distant hay-fields, and nearer pines and hemlocks, and other 
of nature's numberless perfume-boxes. The hay-harvest had 
been remarkably late this year. 

" This is higher enjoyment," said John, — " than half those 
who make their homes in rich houses and mighty palaces 
have any notion of." 

" But, cannot rich people look at the moon ?" said Ellen. 

" Yes, but the taste for pure pleasures is commonly gone 
when people make a tiade of pleasure." 

'Mr. John" — Ellen began. 

" I will forewarn you," said he, — " that Mr. John has made 
up his mind he will do nothing more for you. So if you 
have anything to ask, it must lie still, — unless you will begin 
again." 

Ellen drew back. He looked grave, but she saw Alice 
smiling. 

" But what shall I do ?" said she, a little perplexed and half 
laughing. " What do you mean Mr. John ? What does he 
mean Alice?" 

" You could speak without a * Mr.' to me this morning 
when you were in trouble." 

" Oh !" said Ellen laughing, — " I forgot myself then." 

" Have the goodness to forget yourself permanently for the 
future." 

" Was that man hurt this morning, John ?" said his sister. 
" What man ?" 

" That man you delivered Ellen from." 

" Hurt ? no — nothing material ; I did not wish to hurt him. 
He richly deserved punishment, but it was not for me to 
give it." 

"He was in no hurry to get up," said Ellen. 

" I do not think he ventured upon that till we were well 
out of the way. He lifted his head and looked after us as 
we rode off." 

" But I wanted to ask something," said Ellen, — " ! what 
is the reason the moon looks so much larger when she first 
gets up than she does afterwards ?" 

" Whom are you asking ?" 
You." 







" And who is you ? Here are two people in the moonlight." 

" Mr. John Humpheys, — Alice's brother, and that Thomas 
calls * the young master,' " said Ellen laughing. 

" You are more shy of taking a leap than your little horse 
is," said John smiling, — " but i shall bring you up to it yet. 
What is the cause of the sudden enlargement of my thumb ?" 

He had drawn a small magnifying glass from his pocket 
and held it between his hand and Ellen, 

"Why it is not enlarged," said Ellen, — "it is only magnified." 

" What do you mean by that ?" 

" Why, the glass makes it look larger." 

" Do you know how, or why ?" 

" No." 

He put up the glass again. 

" But what do you mean by that ?" said Ellen ; — " there is 
no magnifying glass between us and the moon to make her 
look larger." 

" You are sure of that ?" 

" Why yes !" said Ellen ; — " I am perfectly sure ; there is 
nothing in the world. There she is, right up there, looking 
straight down upon us, and there is nothing between." 

" What is it that keeps up that pleasant fluttering of leaves 
in the wood ?" 

" Why, the wind." 

" And what is the wind ?" 

" It is air — air moving, I suppose." 

" Exactly. Then there is something between us and the 
moon." 

 " The air ! But, Mr. John, one can see quite clearly 
through the air; it doesn't make things look larger or 
smaller." 

" How far do you suppose the air reaches from us towards 
the moon ?" 

" Why, all the way, don't it ?" 

" No — only about forty miles. If it reached all the way 
there would indeed be no magnifying glass in the case." 

"But how is it?" said Ellen. " I don't understand." 

"I cannot tell you to-night, Ellie. There is a long lad- 
der of knowledge to go up before we can get to the moon, 
but we will begin to mount to-morrow, if nothing happens. 







Alice, you have that little book of Conversations on Natural Philosophy, which you and I used to delight ourselves 
with in old time ?" 

" Safe and sound in the book-case," said Alice. " I have 
thought of giving it to Ellen before, but she has been busy 
enough with what she had already." 

" i have done Rollin now, though," said Ellen ; — " that is 
lucky. I am ready for the moon," 

'i'his new study was begun the next day, and Ellen took 
great delight in it. She would have run on too fast in her 
eagerness but for the steady hand of her teacher ; he obliged 
her to be very thorough. This was only one of her items of 
business. The weeks of John's stay were as usual not merely 
weeks of constant and varied delight, but of constant and swift 
improvement too. 

A good deal of time was given to the riding-lessons. John 
busied himself one morning in preparing a bar for her on the 
lawn ; so placed that it might fall if the horse's heels touched 
it. Here Ellen learned to take first standing, and then run- 
ning, leaps. She was afraid at first, but habit wore that off ; 
and the bar was raised higher and higher, till Margery de- 
clared she " couldn't stand and look at her going over it." 
Then John made her ride without the stirrup, and with her 
hands behind her, while he, holding the horse by a long halter, made him go round in a circle, slowly at first, and afterwards trotting and cantering, till Ellen felt almost as secure 
on his back as in a chair. It took a good many lessons how- 
ever to bring her to this, and she trembled very much at the 
beginning. Her teacher was careful and gentle, but determined ; and whatever he said she did, tremble or no tremble ; 
and in general loved her riding lessons dearly. 

Drawing too went on finely. He began to let her draw 
things from nature ; and many a pleasant morning the three 
went out together with pencils and books and work, and spent 
hours in the open air. They would fir d a pretty point of 
view, or a nice shady place where the breeze came, and where
