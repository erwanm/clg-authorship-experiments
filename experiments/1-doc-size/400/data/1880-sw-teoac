 

months that we have been travelling together, 
we have had time to learn to know each other 
pretty well. You must have been able to make 
up your mind about me." 

" Which part of your character ? " 

" Miss Dolly," said Lawrence with some heat, 
" you know what I mean." 

" Do I ? But I did not know that I had to make 
up my mind about anything concerning you. I 
thought that was done, long ago." 

" And you do not like me any better now than 
you did then ? " 

" Perhaps I do," said Dolly slowly. " I always 
liked you, Mr. St. Leger, and I had cause. You 
have been a very kind friend to us." 

" For your sake, Dolly." 

" I am sorry, for that," she said. 

" And I have waited all this time, in the hope 
that you would get accustomed to me, and your 
objections would wear away. You know what 
your father and mother wish concerning us. Does 
their wish not weigh with you ? " 

'-No," said Dolly very quietly. "This is my 
affair; not theirs." 

"It is their affair so far as your interests are 
involved. And I do not wish to praise myself; 
but you know they think that those interests would 
be secured by a marriage with me. And I believe 
I could make you happy, Dolly." 

Dolly shook her head. " How could you ? " she 
said. "We belong to two opposite parties, and 



 

are following two different lines of life. You 
would not like my way, and I should not like 
yours. How could either of us be happy ? '' 

" Even granting all that," said Lawrence, " why 
should you not bear with my peculiarities and I 
with yours, and neither be the worse? That is 
very frequently done." 

" Is it ? I do not think it ought to be done." 

" Let us prove that it can be. I will never interfere with you, Dolly." 

" Yes, you would," said Dolly, dimpling all over 
again. " Do you think you would make up your 
mind to have no wine in your cellar or on your 
table? Take that for one thing. I should have 
no wine on mine.' 

"That's a crotchet of yours," said he smiling at 
her: he thought if this were all, the thing might 
be managed. 

" That is only one thing, Mr. St. Leger," Dolly 
went on very gravely now. " I should be unfashionable in a hundred ways, and you would not like 
that. I should spend money on objects and for 
causes that you would not care about nor agree to. 
I am telling you all this to reconcile you to doing 
without me." 

"Your refusal is absolute, then?" 

" Yes." 

"You would not bring up these extraneous 
things, Dolly, if you had any love for me." 

" I do not know why that should make any 
difference. It might make it hard." 



 

" Then you have no love for me ? " 

"I am afraid not," said Dolly gently. "Not 
what you mean. And without that, you would 
not wish for a different answer from me." 

" Yes, I would ! " said he. "All that would come ; 
but you know your own business best." 

Dolly thought she did, and the proposition remained un controverted. Therewith the discourse 
died; and the miles that remained were made in 
unsocial silence. Dolly feared she had given some 
pain, but doubted it could not be very great ; and 
she w r as glad to have the explanation over. Perhaps the pain was more than she knew; although 
Lawrence certainly was not a desperate wooer; 
nevertheless he was disappointed, and he was mortified; and mortification is hard to a man. For 
the matter of that, it is hard to anybody. It was 
not till the villa occupied by the Thayers was close 
before them that he spoke again. 

" Do you expect to stay much longer in Italy ? " 

" I am afraid, not," Dolly answered. 

" I have reason to think Mr. Copley will not. 
Indeed I know as much. I thought you might 
like to be informed." 

Dolly said nothing. Her eyes roved over the 
beautiful bay, almost with an echo of Eve's "Must 
I then leave thee, Paradise ? " in her heart. The 
smoke curling up from Vesuvius caught the light; 
little sails skimming over the sea reflected it; the 
sweetness of thousands of roses and orange blos- 
soms and countless other flowers filled all the air; 



 

it was a time and a scene of nature's most abun- 
dant and beautiful bounty. Dolly checked her don- 
key, and for a few minutes stood looking; then 
with a brave determination that she would enjoy 
it all as much as she could while she had it, she 
went into the house. 



CHAPTER XXIX. 

WHITHER NOW? 

THE days that followed were full of pleasure; 
and Dolly kept to her resolution, not to spoil 
the present by care about the future. Indeed the 
balmy air and the genial light and all the wealth 
that nature has bestowed upon southern Italy, were 
a help to such a resolution. The infinite lavish 
fulness of the present quite laughed at the idea 
of barrenness or want anywhere in time to 
come. Dolly knew that was nature's subtle flattery, not to be trusted, and yet she willingly admitted the flattery. Nothing should spoil these 
days. 

One evening she and Christina were sitting 
again on the bank, wondering at the marvellous 
sunset panorama. 

" How difficult it is, looking at this," said Dolly, 
" to believe that there is want and misery in the 
world." 

" Why should you believe it ? " said Christina. 
" I don't think there is, except where people have 
brought it upon themselves." 

" People bring it upon other people. But to 



 

look at this, one would say it was impossible. 
And this is how the world was meant to be, I 
suppose." 

" What do you mean ? how ? " said Christina. 
" It is rich to hear you talk." 

" look at it, Christina ! Look at the colours, 
and the lights and the sparkle everywhere, the 
perfect wealth of loveliness in form as well as colour; and if you think a minute you will know that 
he who made it all meant people to be happy, and 
meant them to be as full of happiness as the earth 
is full of beauty." 

" I don't see ' lights ' and ' colours ' so much 
as you do, Dolly; I am not an artist; but if 
God meant them to be happy, why aren't they 
happy?" 

" Sin " said Dolly. 

"What's the use of thinking about it? You 
and I cannot help it." 

" Christina, that is not true. We can help some 
of it." 

"By giving money, you mean? Well, we do, 
whenever we see occasion; but there is no end 
of the cheatery." 

" Giving money will not take away the world's 
misery, Christina." 

" What will, then ? It will do a good deal." 

" It will do a good deal, but it does not touch 
the root of the trouble." 

"What does, Dolly? you dreamer." 

"The knowledge of Christ." 




" Well, it is the business of clergymen and missionaries to give them that." 

" Prove it." 

" Why that's what they are for." 

"Do you think there are enough of them to 
preach the good news to every creature ? " 

" Well, then there ought to be more." 

"And in the mean time? Tell me, Christina, 
to whom was that command given, to preach the 
gospel to every creature ? " 

" To the apostles, of course ! " 

" Twelve men ? Or eleven men rather. They 
could not. No, it was given to all the disciples; 
and so, Christina, it was given to you, and to me." 

" To preach the gospel ! " said Christina. 

"That is, just to tell the good news." 

"And to whom do you propose we should tell it?" 

"The command says, everybody." 

" How can you and I do that, Dolly ? " 

"That is just what I am studying, Christina. I 
do not quite know. But when I look out on all this 
wonderful beauty, and see what it means, and think 
how miserable the world is, just the very opposite, I feel that I must do it, somehow or other." 

Christina lifted her arms above her head and 
clapped her hands together. " Mad, mad ! " she 
exclaimed; "You are just gone mad, Dolly. 
I wish you'd get married, and forget all your 
whimsies. The right sort of man would make 
you forget them. Haven't you found the right 
sort of man yet ? " 



 

"The right sort of man would help ms carry 
them out." 

"It must be my Sandie, then; there isn't an 
other match for you in extravagant ideas in all 
this world. What does Mr. St. Leger think of 
them ? " 

" I never asked him. I suppose he would take 
very much your view." 

"And you don't care what view he takes?" said 
Christina, looking sharply at her. 

"Not in the least. Except for his own sake." 

The one drawback upon the perfect felicity of 
this visit was, that the said Sandie did not appear. They could not wait for him; they went 
on the most charming of excursions, by sea and 
land, wishing for him; in which wish Dolly heartily shared. It had been one of the pleasures she 
had promised herself in coming to the Thayers', 
that she should see Mr. Shubrick again. He had 
interested her singularly, and even taken not a 
little hold of her fancy. So she was honestly disappointed when at last a note came from him, saying that he found it impossible to join the party. 

"That means just that he has something on hand 
that he calls ' duty ' which anybody else would 
put off or hand over," said Christina pouting. 

"Duty is a very good reason," said Dolly. 
" Don't you see, you are sure of Mr. Shubrick, 
that in any case he will not do what he thinks 
wrong? I think you ought to be a very happy 
woman, Christina." 




But the excursions were made without Mr. Shubrick's social or material help. They went to 
Capri; they visited the grottoes; nay, they made 
a party to go up Vesuvius. All that was to be 
seen, they saw; and as Christina declared, they 
left nothing undone that they could do. Then 
came the breaking up. 

"Are you expecting to go back to that stuffy 
little place at Sorrento ? " Mr. Copley asked. It 
was the evening before their departure, and all 
the party were sitting, scattered about upon the 
verandah. 

" Father ! " cried Dolly. " It is the airiest, floweriest, sunniest, brightest, most delightful altogether house, that ever took lodgers in ! " 

" It certainly wasn't stuffy, Mr. Copley," said his 
wife. 

" Dolly likes it because you couldn't get a glass 
of good wine in the house. Whatever the rest of 
humanity like, she makes war upon. I conclude 
you are reckoning upon going back there, my wife 
and daughter ? " 

" Are not you, Mr. Copley ? " his wife asked. 

" I must be excused." 

" Then where are you going ? " 

" Home." 

" Home ! " exclaimed Mrs. Copley. " Do you 
mean home? Boston?" 

" A Boston woman thinks Boston is the centre 
of the universe, you may notice," said Mr. Copley, 
turning to Mr. Thayer. " It's a curious peculiarity. 



 

No matter what other cities on the face of the earth 
you shew her, her soul turns back to Boston." 

"Don't say anything against *Boston," said Mrs. 
Thayer; "it's a good little place. I know, when 
Mr. Thayer first carried me there, it took me a 
while to get accustomed to it; things on a different scale, you know, and looked at from a different 
point of view; but I soon found admirers, and then 
friends. I assure you, Boston and I were very 
fond of each other in those days; and though I 
lost my claims to admiration a long time ago, I 
have kept my friends." 

" I have no doubt the admirers are still there 
too," said Mr. Copley. " Does Mrs. Thayer mean 
to say she has no admirers? I profess myself 
one ! " 

" Christina takes the admiration uow-a-days. I 
am contented with that." 

" And so you conquer by proxy." 

" Mr. Copley," here put in his wife, " if you do 
not mean America by ' home,' what do you mean ? 
and where are you going ? " 

" Where my home has been for a number of 
years. England London." 

" But you have given up your office ? " 

" I am half sorry, that is a fact." 

" Then what should you do in London ? " 

" My dear, of the many hundred thousands who 
call London their home, very few have an office." 

" But they have business of some kind ? " 

"That is a Boston notion. Did you ever ob- 



 

serve, Thayer, that a Massachusetts man has no 
idea of life without business? It is the reason 
why he is in the world, to him; it never occurs
