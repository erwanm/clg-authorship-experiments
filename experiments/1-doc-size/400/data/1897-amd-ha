that." 

" Come on, then," said Dele, laughingly, when 
her brother had ended his explanations, " if you can 
go straight on a crooked road ; and if Hanny gets 
tired, Ben and I will make a chair and carry her. 

Joe smiled down at his little sister. He had 
linked his arm within hers. Ben and Delia were 
fond of falling behind. They were so merry, that 
Hanny was a little curious to know what they 
found to laugh about. It does not take much to 
amuse healthy young people before their tastes 
become complicated. 

The old road wound a little, and had the curves 
that prove no one horse or man ever walks in a 
straight line. But, oh, how beautiful it was with 
the fruit-trees and shrubbery in bloom, wild flow- 
ers, and stretches of meadow, where cows were pas- 
tured, and here and there a small flock of sheep ! 
Up above, on the brow of a hill, a wooded back- 
ground gave it a still more picturesque appearance. 

They passed an old stone house on the west 
side that was really a Revolutionary relic. The 
stone ran up to the eaves ; but the two gables were 
of timber. It was on quite a bit of hill then, and 
had broken stone steps up to the first terrace, 

 

where great clumps of brownish yellow lilies 
were in bloom. When strolling parties of British 
soldiery went marauding about, the residents of 
this vicinity used to flee to the old Plum house 
as a place of refuge. The heavy double doors and 
wooden shutters could not well be battered down, 
though bullet-marks could be traced here and there. 

A Captain Alden lived in it now, who was 
himself quite a character. He had been in the 
British navy, with Admiral Nelson's command. 
When his time in the service ended, he had 
shipped with what he understood was a merchant 
vessel, but on learning it was a slaver, bound for 
Africa to gather up a human cargo, he sprang 
overboard, when he saw a vessel passing that 
halted for his signal. Several shots were fired at 
him, which he escaped. Later on, he was im- 
pressed in the naval service again, but at the first 
opportunity came to America. A hale, hearty 
old man, rather short in stature, but lithe and 
active, and with a merry look on his weather- 
beaten face, he was still proud of his schooner 
that lay at Stone Dock, at the launching of which, 
in the early part of the century, the Jersey Blues 
had turned out, and Major Stevens had christened 
it the "Northern Liberties." It had been all 
built of Essex County lumber, and constructed on 
the Passaic. But the river had been quite a 
famous stream in those days. There were no 
factories using up its volume of water. 

They sat on the stone coping and listened to 
the Captain's stories, indeed, could have spent 



all the afternoon, so entertaining did he prove. 
Then he took them through the old house with its 
ample hall and spacious rooms on one side. They 
concluded it must have been able to stand quite a 
siege, judging from its present solidity. And 
Mrs. Alden treated them to a pitcher of freshly 
churned buttermilk, and a slice of excellent rye 
bread, which they found delightful. 

" I shall have to come over again, and get some 
material for a story," declared Delia, when they 
were fairly started, tearing themselves away with 
quite a struggle. "That experience on the 
'Slaver' was very graphic. " 

" If you want to hear something that will make 
your hair stand on end," said Doctor Joe, "come 
up and talk to father. When I was a little lad, 
we had a farm-hand working for us who had gone 
through with it all, been to Africa for a cargo, 
and come to the States with what was left of it. 
He never spoke of it when sober; and though he 
was in the main steady, once in a while he drank 
enough to start him going, and he always re- 
hearsed this horrible experience. I remember 
father used to lock him in the barn to sober up; 
because he did not want us children to hear the 
terrible story. " 

"Were the slaves brought that way?' asked 
Hanny, with a shudder. 

" Most every civilised country condemns that 
part of the awful practice," answered Ben. 'But 
it is a fact that the native tribes in Africa sell 
prisoners to one another, or whoever will buy 

 

them. Do you suppose Africa will ever be 
explored? ' and Ben looked up at Mr. Whitney. 

We did not know much about Africa even then. 
But Ben was afterward to see the great explorer 
Stanley, whose journey across that country was 
a wonderful romance. And although the question 
of slavery was seething even then, he could not 
have dreamed, this lovely afternoon when all was 
at peace, that one day he should be in the thick of 
the battle himself, with many another brave soul, 
when his country was nearly rent in twain. 

A few lanes led up to places, the outline of 
streets, and lost themselves in the fields. Cot- 
tages had been built to face nearly every way. 
Here and there was an old colonial house of 
greater pretensions, some of them at the end of a 
long driveway lined with stately trees. Here 
also were the remnants of orchards, meadows 
where cows were pasturing, thickets of shrubbery 
with bread-and-butter vine running over them, 
showing glossy green leaves. 

Mr. Whitney paused at a queer, long, one-story 
house with a high-peaked roof in which were set 
three small dormer windows. There was a little 
dooryard in front, a Dutch hall door with an iron 
knocker, a well near by with the old oaken bucket 
General Morris had immortalised, and back of 
the house a picturesque ravine through which ran 
a clear stream of water that presently found its 
way out to the Passaic. Willows bent over it, 
elms and maples stood, tall and handsome, like 

guardian sentinels. 



A little old woman sat sewing by the window. 

"We haven't time to stop," said Mr. Whitney. 
"Hanny, that lady is your hero's grandmother, 
and the mother of General Watts Kearny. He 
not only distinguished himself in the Mexican 
War, but also in the \Var of 1812. Then he was 
Governor of Vera Cruz and the City of Mexico." 

"And the hero of no end of stories," added 
Ben. " Jim and I were wild over them a few years 
ago. Why do people keep saying we have no 
romance in our own country, because we have no 
ruined old castles? Why, Mexico itself is a land 
of historical romance ! ' 

" What a lovely cool dell ! ' exclaimed Dele. 
"Just the place to take your book on a hot 
summer day." 

" I believe your young hero Philip was born in 
New York. But this is the old home, one of the 
landmarks." 

Opposite was a rather pretty place, - a ram- 
bling brick house with sharp, pointed roofs, and 
a long stretch of evergreens. It was beautiful in 
this soft atmosphere. The birds made a swift 
dazzle now and then, and filled the air with melody. 

" Up here is a hedge of hawthorn that was 
brought over from England by a Yorkshireman 
living up above. It is out of bloom now; but 
another year you can come over early in May and 
see the ' hawthorn blossoms white ' that poets 
never tire of praising.' 

Dele broke off a sprig for herself, and one for 
Hanny. The spaces were larger, the houses 



' 

farther apart. On the west side was a tree -nursery 
and garden, and two quaint old frame-houses that 
hardly looked large enough for any one to live in ; 
but there were children playing about ; and on the 
other side a cemetery. All this tract was known 
as Mount Pleasant. 

At the north of the cemetery, they plunged 
down a stony way called a road, mostly by courtesy, 
though it was the only way of getting up from 
the river. Great trees overhung it on one side, 
and gave it a weird, darkened aspect. 

" It might be a ghost-walk, at night," exclaimed 
Delia. " Edgar A. Poe could have put a story here. 
I like the tragic; but I 'm not so fond of the 
horrible." 

Another turn showed them the river and the 
opposite shore crowned with green glittering in 
the afternoon sunshine. They all paused, it was 
such a wonderful outlook. 

And when they reached it, and glanced up and 
down, it was a picture indeed. The river made 
little bends, and wound around tiny points, edged 
with the greenest of sedge grass in some places, 
then grey stones with mossy sea-growth, or wil- 
lows dipping their branches in the lightly ruffled 
water. Not a soul to be seen anywhere, not a 
sound save the voices of birds ; but while they 
looked, a flock of geese came floating grandly down. 

" On thy fair bosom, silver lake, 
The white swan spreads her snowy sail," 

quoted Delia. 



"It is not the first time swans have proved 
geese," said Mr. Theodore, with a smile. "But 
for the sake of the picturesque we will let it pass. 

" I wonder if the Wye or the Severn would 
be so enchanting to us if poets had not lived there 
and immortalised them ? ' 

" When we are an old country, we will, no doubt, 
sigh for relics. In 1666, this was called ' Neworke 
or Pesayak towne; ' and a little more than a hun- 
dred years ago this Gully was made the dividing 
line between the towns. There are many historic 
spots in Belleville, and an old copper mine that 
once made a great addition to her prosperity. 
But my quest ends here. I don't know as I have 
a hero exactly, Miss Hanny, yet my friend, Frank 
Forrester, has had a varied and eventful life. 
This way.' 

Mr. Whitney led them up a path mostly over- 
grown with pale, spindling grass that had no 
chance for sunshine, so close and tall were the 
trees. It was undeniably gloomy, hidden away 
here. A little old brown, weather-beaten house 
hung with vines, that even stretched up into the 
trees; small, narrow windows, with diamond- 
shaped panes that could not let in much light, 
it would seem. 

"It's a horrid place," cried Dele. "Hanny, 
we shall surely see a ghost. The idea of living 
at the very foot of a burying-ground ! ' 

Hanny held tight to Joe's hand. She was 
beginning to have what Miss Cynthia called the 
"creeps." 







CHAPTER XIII 

OUT-OF-THE-WAY CORNERS 

IF the outside was gloomy, it had a queer, dis- 
orderly, and rather cheerful aspect within, for the 
sun was pouring a flood of gold in one window 
where it happened to strike a spot between two 
trees. And Frank Forrester was by no means 
melancholy to-day. He shook hands cordially 
with Mr. Whitney, and welcomed the rest of the 
party with the utmost affability, - -a fine-looking 
Englishman with a picturesque air, due largely 
to his rather long hair, which fell about his fore- 
head and neck in a tumbled manner, suggesting a 
tendency to curls. 

'These young people may like to look over 
my curiosities, while we have our talk," he said. 
"Take a cigar, and I'll bring a bottle of wine. 
Won't you join us, Doctor? Here, young folks, 
are curiosities from everywhere." 

He ushered them into a small room that was 
library and everything by turns. There were 
trophies of hunting expeditions, some rare birds 
stuffed and mounted, looking so alive Hanny 
would not have been surprised if they had sud- 
denly begun to warble; books in every stage of 



dilapidation, some of them quite rare copies, Ben 
found; portfolios of old engravings; curious 
weapons; foreign wraps; Grecian and Turkish 
bits of pottery; and the odd things we call bric- 
a-brac nowadays. 

Delia began to make some notes. Ben laughed 
a little. Interviewing was not such a fine art 
then; and people were considered greater subjects 
of interest than their belongings. But Delia was 
saving up things for stories which she meant to 
write as she found time. 

Doctor Joe had come in here with the young 
people, leaving the two friends to discuss their 
business. He, too, found much to interest him; 
and he was amused at Delia's running comments, 
some of them very bright indeed. She was quite 
a spur to Ben, he found ; and he was surprised 
at the varied stock of knowledge Ben had 
accumulated. 

It did not seem as if they had explored half, 
when Mr. Whitney opened the door. 

; Young folks, we must be going, if we expect 
to reach home that very same night, like the old 
woman with her pig," he said. 

"Are you talked out?' asked Delia, archly; 
"for we haven't half looked through things.' 

"I want your brother to stay and have some 
supper with me. I 'in my own housekeeper now; 
but I think we could manage.'' 

" What fun it would be, " said Delia. " As there 
are no stores, we should have to start at the 
foundation of things." 

 

"I have a loaf of bread, and some cold mutton, 
and eggs, I think, and tea and coffee. Come, 
you had better accept my hospitality." 

"I must be home in the early evening," re- 
marked Doctor Joe. 

"And Hanny 's not to stay out after dark," 
appended Ben. 

"We are going down to Cockloft Hall," ex- 
plained Mr. Whitney. " I am sorry we cannot 
accept." 

"Then you must bring your happy family again. 
If they are fond of curiosities, the old house could 
entertain them all day long." 

" And if they are fond of adventures, which 
they are, they might put you to the test," said 
Delia, daringly. 

Herbert laughed at the vivacious tone. 

"Then you 'd have to find me in the mood. In 
that respect, I am variable." 

"Do you have a mood for each day? Then 
your friends could be sure ' 

" A good idea, like the ladies' reception-days. 
Must I put on the card, Serious, Jolly, Adventur- 
ous, etc. ? ' 

"And supernatural. I should come on the 
ghost days. For if ever a ghost walked out of its 
earthy habitation, I should think it would be here. 
Did you ever see a ghost, Mr. Herbert? ' 

" I have seen some queer things. But these up 
here," nodding his head, "seem a very well 
behaved community. I can't say that they have 
troubled me; and I've come down the road at 



twelve or so at night. Perhaps my imagination 
is not vivid enough in that line. Have you ever 
seen a ghost, Miss Whitney? ' 

' No, I have not, except the ghosts of my imagi-
