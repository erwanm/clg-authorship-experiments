"What made him buy that sing-song girl?" Re- 
garding this, Ruth had ideas of her own, but she 
wanted the doctor's point of view. 

"Maybe he realized that he was slipping fast and 
thought a fine action might give him a hand-hold on 
life again. You tell me he didn't like the stuff." 





''He shuddered when he drank." 

  Well, that's a hopeful sign. I'll test him out 
later; see if there is any craving. Give me the 
books. I'll put them in your room; then we'll have 
a look-see." 

The patient was asleep. According to Wu, the 
young man had not opened his eyes once during the 
afternoon. 

So Ruth returned to her room and sorted the 
books and magazines the doctor had loaned her, in- 
spected the titles and searched for pictures. And 
thus it was that she came upon a book of Stevenson's 
verse —  her first adventure into poetry. The hym- 
nal lyrics had never stirred her; she had memorized 
and sung them parrot-wise. But here was new 
music, tender and kindly and whimsical, that first 
roved to and fro in the mind and then cuddled up in 
the heart. Anything that had love in it! 

The doctor comprehended that he also had his 
work cut out. While the girl kept the patient from 
dwelling upon his misfortunes, whatever these were, 
he himself would have to keep the girl from brooding 
over hers. So he made merry at the dinner table, 
told comic stories, and was astonished at the readi- 
ness with which she grasped the comic side of life. 
His curiosity put itself into a question. 

"Old Morgan the trader," she explained, "used 
to save me Tii-Bills. He would read the jokes and 
illustrate them; and after a time I could see the 



 

I>o]nt of a joke without having it explained to me. 
I believe it amused him. I was a novelty. He was 
always in a state of semi-intoxication» but he was al- 
ways gentle with me. Probably he taught me 
what a joke was merely to irritate my father; for 
suddenly Father stopped my going to the store for 
things and sent our old Kanaka cook instead. She 
had been to San Francisco, and what I learned 
about the world was from her. Thank you for the 
books." 

"You were bom on the island?" 

"I beheve so." 

''You don't remember your mother?" 

''0h, no; she died when I was very little." 

She showed him the locket; and he studied the 
face. It was equally as beautiful but not quite so 
fine as the daughter's. He returned the locket with- 
out conmient. 

"Perhaps things would have been diflFerent if she 
had lived." 

"No doubt," he replied. "Mine died while I 
was over here. Perhaps that is why I lost my am- 
bition." 

"I am sorry." 

"It is life." 

There was a pause. "He never let me keep a dog 
or a cat about the house. But after a time I learned 
the ways of the parrakeets, and they would come 
down to me like doves in the stories. I never made 





any eflFort to touch them; so by and by they learned 
to light fearlessly on my arms and shoulders. And 
what a noise they made ! This is how I used to call 
them." 

She pursed her lips and uttered a whistle, pierc- 
ingly shrill and high; and instantly she became the 
object of intense astonishment on the part of the 
other diners. She was quite oblivious to the sen- 
sation she had created. 

The picture of her flashed across the doctor's 
vision magically. The emerald wings, slashed with 
scarlet and yellow, wheeling and swooping about 
her head, there among the wild plantain. 

"I never told anybody," she went on. "An audi- 
ence might have frightened the birds. Only in the 
sunshine; they would not answer my whistle on 
cloudy days." 

"Didn't the natives have a name for you?" 

She blushed. "It was silly." 

" Go on, tell me," he urged, enchanted. Never 
was there another girl like this one. He blushed, too, 
spiritually, as it were. He had invited himself to 
dine with her merely to watch her table manners. 
They were exquisite. Knowing the South Seas 
from hearsay and by travel, he knew something of 
that inertia which blunted the fineness, innate and 
acquired, of white men and women, the eternal war- 
fare against indifference and slovenliness. Only the 
strong survived. This queer father of hers had 



 

given her everything but his arms. "Tell me, what 
did they call you?" 

" Well, the old Kanaka cook used to call me the 
Golden One, but the natives called me the Dawn 
Pearl." 

"The Dawn Pearl! Odd, but we white folks 
aren't half so poetical as the yellow or the black. 
What did you do when your father went on trips 
to other islands?" 

"Took off my shoes and stockings and played in 
the lagoon." 

"He made you wear shoes and stockings?" 

"Always." 

"What else did you do when alone?" 

"I read the encyclopaedia. That is how I learned 
that there were such things as novels. Books! 
Aren't they wonderful?" 

The blind alley of life stretching out before her, 
with its secret doorways and hidden menaces; and 
she was unconcerned. Books; an inexplicable hun' 
ger to be satisfied. Somewhere in the world there 
was a book clerk with a discerning mind; for he had 
given her the best he had. He envied her a little. 
To fall upon those tales for the first time, when the 
mind was fresh and the heart was young! 

He became aware of an odd phase to this conver- 
sation. The continuity was frequently broken in 
upon by diversory suppositions. Take the one that 
struck him at this moment. Supposing that was 





it; at least, a solution to part of this amazing riddle? 
Supposing her father had made her assist him in 
the care of the derelicts solely to fill her with loath- 
iag and abhorrence for mankind? 

'' Didn't you despise the men your father brought 
home — the beachcombers?'' 

' No. In the beginning I was afraid; but after 
the first several cases, I had only pity. I somehow 
understood ' 

"Didn't some of them .... try to touch you?'  

"Not the true unfortunates.. How men suffer 
for the foolish things they do!'' 

"Ay to that. There's our young friend upstairs.'' 

''There's a funny idea in my head. I've been 
thinking about it ever since morning. There was 
a loose button on that coat, and I want to sew it on. 
It keeps dangling in front of my eyes." 

"Ah, yes; that coat. Probably a sick man's whim. 
Certainly, there wasn't a thing in the pockets. But 
be very careful not to let him know. If he awoke 
and caught you at it, there might be a set-back. By 
the way, what did he say when he was out of his 
head?'' 

"The word Tool.' He muttered it continually. 
There was another phrase which sounded something 
like 'Gin in a blue-serge coat'. I wonder what he 
meant by that?'' 

"The Lord knows!" 

The patient was restless during the first watch of 



d 



 

the night. He stirred continually, thrusting his legs 
about and flinging his arms above his head. Gently 
each time Ruth drew down the arms. There was a 
recurrence of fever, but nothing alarming. Once 
she heard him mutter, and she leaned down. 

"Ali Baba, in a blue-serge coat! .... God-for- 
saken fool!" 



CHAPTER Xm 

ONE day Ruth caught the patient's eyes fol- 
lowing her about; but there was no question 
in the gaze, no interest; so she pretended not 
to notice. 

'' Where am I?'' asked Spurlock. 

''In Canton." 

"How long have I been in bed?'' 

 'A week." 

"My coat, please." 

"It is folded under your pillow." 

"Did I ask for it?" 

"Yes. But perhaps you don't know; there was 
nothing in the pockets. You were probably robbed 
in Hong-Kong." 

"Nothing in the pockets." 

 'You see, we didn't know but you might die; and 
so we had to search your belongings for the address 
of your people." 

"I have no people — anybody who would care." 

She kindled with sympathy. He was all alone, 
too. Nobody who cared. 

Ruth was inflanmiable; she would always be 
flaring up swiftly, in pity, in tenderness, in anger; 
she would always be answering impulses, without 

 



 

seeking to weigh or to analyse them. She was emerg- 
ing from the primordial as Spurlock was declining 
toward it. She was on the rim of civilization, en- 
tering, as Spurlock was on the rim, preparing to 
make his exit. Two souls in travail; one inspired 
by fresh hopes, the other, by fresh despairs. Both 
of them would be committing novel and unforget- 
table acts. 

"How long shall I be here?'' he asked. 

"That depends upon you. Not very long, if you 
want to get well." 

"Are you a nurse?" 

"Yes. Don't ask any more questions. Wait a 
little; rest." 

There was a pause. Ruth flashed in and out of 
the sunshine; and he took note of the radiant nimbus 
above her head each time the sunshine touched her 
hair. 

"Haven't I seen you somewhere before?" 

"The first day you came. Don't you remember? 
There were four of us, and we went touring in the 
city." 

"As in a dream." There was another pause. 
"Was I out of my head?" 

"Yes." 

"What did I say?" 

"Only one word," she said, offering her first white 
lie. 

"What was it?" He was insistent. 





"You repeated the word  FooV over and over." 

"Nothing else?" 

"No. Now, no more questions, or I shall be 
forced to leave the room." 

"I promise to ask no more ' 

"Would you like to have me read to you?'' 

He did not answer. So she took up Stevenson 
and began to read aloud. She read beautifully 
because the fixed form of the poem signified noth- 
ing. She went from period to period exactly as she 
would have read prose; so that sense and music were 
equally balanced. She read for half an hour, then 
closed the book because Spurlock appeared to have 
fallen asleep. But he was wide awake. 

"What poet was that?" 

" Stevenson." Ruth had read from page to page in 
"The Child's Garden of Verse," generally unfamiliar 
to the admirers of Stevenson. Of course Ruth was 
not aware that in this same volume there were lyrics 
known the world over. 

Inunediately Spurlock began to chant one of these. 

" TJnder the wide and starry sky. 
Dig the grave and let me lie. 
Glad did I live and gladly die> 
And I laid me down with a will." ' 



u 



'This be the verse you grave for me: 
Here he lies where he longed to be; 
Home is the sailor, home from the sea. 
And the hunter home from the hill.' " 



 

''What is that?'' she asked. Something in his 
tone pinched her heart. "Did you write it?" 

"No. You will find it somewhere in that book. 
Ah, if I had written that! 
Don't you want to live? 
I don't know; I really don't know. 
''But you are young!" It was a protest, almost 
vehement. She remembered the doctor's warning 
that the real battle would begin when the patient 
recovered consciousness. "You have all the world 
before you." 

"Rather behind me;" and he spoke no more that 
morning. 

Throughout the afternoon, while the doctor was 
giving her the first lesson out of his profound know- 
edge of life, her interest would break away con- 
tinually, despite her honest efforts to pin it down to 
the facts so patiently elucidated for her. Recurrently
