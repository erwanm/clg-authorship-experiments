hereafter, how much more substantial rewards 
he may attain, this first sweetness of incense to 
his ambition will never come to him again. 

When Philip returned to town, the city was 
still a social desert, and he plunged into the work 
piled up on his desk, the never-ceasing accumu- 
lation of manuscripts, most of them shells which 
the workers have dredged up from the mud of 
the literary ocean, in which the eager publisher 
is always expecting to find pearls. Even Celia 
was still in the country, and Philip's hours spared 
from drudgery were given to the new story. His 
days, therefore, passed without incident, but not 
without pleasure. For whatever annoyances the 
great city may have usually, it is in the dull 
season — that is, the season of its summer out-of- 
doors animation — a most attractive and even stim- 




 

ulating place for the man who has an absorbing 
pursuit, say a work in creative fiction. Undis- 
turbed by social claims or public interests, the 
very noise and whirl of the gay metropolis seem 
to hem him in and protect the world of his own 
imagination. 

The first disturbing event in this serenity was 
the report of the Mavick ball, already referred 
to, and the interpretation put upon it by the 
newspapers. In this light his plans seemed the 
merest moonshine. What became of his falla- 
cious hope of waiting when events were driving 
on at this rate? What chance had he in such a 
social current ? Would Evelyn be strong enough 
to stem it and to wait also? And to wait for 
what? For the indefinite and improbable event 
of a poor author, hardly yet recognized as an 
author, coming into position, into an income (for 
that was the weak point in his aspirations) that 
would not be laughed at by the millionaire. 
When he coolly considered it, was it reasonable 
to expect that Mr. and Mrs. Mavick would ever 
permit Evelyn to throw away the brilliant op- 
portunity for their daughter which was to be 
the crowning end of their social ambition ? The 
mere statement of the proposition was enough 
to overwhelm him. 

That this would be the opinion of the world 
he could not doubt. He felt very much alone. 




 

It was not, however, in any resolve to make a 
confidante of Celia, but in an absolute need of 
companionship, that he went to see if she had 
returned. That he had any personal interest in 
this ball he did not intend to let Celia know, but 
talk with somebody he must. Of his deep affec- 
tion for this friend of his boyhood, there was no 
doubt, nor of his knowledge of her devotion to 
his interests. "Why, then, was he reserved with 
her upon the absorbing interest of his life ? 

Celia had returned, before the opening of the 
medical college, full of a new idea. This was 
nothing new in her restless nature ; but if Philip 
had not been blinded by the common selfishness 
of his sex, he might have seen in the gladness of 
her welcome of him something more than mere 
sisterly affection. 

" Are you real glad to see me, Phil ? I thought 
you might be lonesome by this time in the de- 
serted city." 

" I was, horribly." He was still holding her 
hand. " Without a chance to talk with you or 
Alice, I am quite an orphan." 

"Ah ! You or Alice !" A shade of disappoint- 
ment came over her face as she dropped his 
hand. But she rallied in a moment. 

" Poor boy ! You ought to have a guardian. 
What heroine of romance are you running after 
now ?" 





 

" In my new story ?" 

" Of course." 

"She isn't very well defined in my mind yet.,; 
But a lovely girl, without anything peculiar, no 
education to speak of, or career, fascinating in 
her womanhood, such as might walk out of the 
Bible. Don't you think that would be a novelty ? 
But it is the most difficult to do." 

" Negative. That sort has gone out. Philip, 
why don't you take the heroine of the Mavick 
ball? There is a theme." She was watching 
hira shrewdly, and saw the flush in his face as 
he hurriedly asked, 

" Did you ever see her?" 

" Only at a distance. But you must know her 
well enough for a literary purpose. The reports 
of the ball give you the setting of the drama." 

" Did you read them ?" 

" I should say I did. Most amusing." 

"Celia, don't you think it would be an un- 
gentlemanly thing to take a social event like 
that?" 

" Why, you must take life as it is. Of course 
you would change the details. You could lay the 
scene in Philadelphia. Nobody would suspect 
you then." 

Philip shook his head. The conversation was 
not taking the turn that was congenial to him. 
The ball seemed to him a kind of maelstrom in 




 

which all his hopes were likely to be wrecked. 
And here was his old friend, the keenest-sighted 
woman he knew, looking upon it simply as liter- 
ary material — a ridiculous social event. He had 
better change the subject. 

" So, the college is not open yet ?" 

" No, I came back because I had a new idea, 
and wanted time to look around. We haven't 
got quite the right idea in our city missions. 
They have another side. We need country mis- 
sions." 

" Aren't they that now ?" 

" JSIo, I mean for the country. I've been about 
a good deal all this vacation, and my ideas are 
confirmed. The country towns and villages are 
full of young hoodlums and toughs, and all sorts 
of wickedness. They could be improved by 
sending city boys up there — yes, and girls of 
tender age. I don't mean the worst ones, not 
altogether. The young of a certain low class 
growing up in the country are even worse than 
the same class in the city, and they lack a civil- 
ity of manner which is pretty sure to exist in a 
city-bred person." 

" If the country is so bad, why send any more 
unregenerates into it?" 

" How do you know that anybody is always to 
be unregenerate ? But I wouldn't send thieves 
and imbeciles. I would select children of some 




 

capacity, whose circumstances are against them 
where they are, and I am sure they would make 
better material than a good deal of the young 
generation in country villages now. This is 
what I mean by a mission for the country. "We 
have been bending all our efforts to the reforma- 
tion of the cities. What we need to go at now is 
the reforming of the country." 

" You have taken a big contract," said Philip, 
smiling at her enthusiasm. "Don't you intend 
to go on with medicine ?" 

" Certainly. At least far enough to be of 
some use in breaking up people's ignorance about 
their own bodies. Half the physical as well as 
moral misery comes from ignorance. Didn't I 
always tell you that I want to know ? A good 
many of my associates pretend to be agnostics, 
neither believe or disbelieve in anything. The 
further I go the more I am convinced that there 
is a positive basis for things. They talk about the 
religion of humanity. I tell you, Philip, that hu- 
manity is pretty poor stuff to build a religion on." 

The talk was wandering far away from what 
was in Philip's mind, and presently Celia per- 
ceived his want of interest. 

" There, that is enough about myself. I want 
to know all about you, your visit to Kivervale, 
how the publishing house suits you, how the 
story is growing." 

And Philip talked about himself, and the 
rumors in Wall Street, and Mr. Ault and his 
offer, and at last about the Mavicks — he could 
not help that — until he felt that Celia was what 
she had always been to him, and when he went 
away he held her hand and said what a dear, 
sweet friend she was. 

And when he had gone Celia sat a long time 
by the window, not seeing much of the hot street 
into which she looked, until there were tears in 
her eyes. 



CHAPTER XXIV 

Theee was one man in New York who thor- 
oughly enjoyed the summer. Murad Ault was, 
as we say of a man who is free to indulge his 
natural powers, in his element. There are in- 
genious people who think that if the ordering of 
nature had been left to them, they could main- 
tain moral conditions, or at least restore a dis- 
turbed equilibrium, without violence, without 
calling in the aid of cyclones and of uncontrol- 
lable electric displays, in order to clear the air. 
There are people also who hold that the moral 
atmosphere of the world does not require the oc- 
casional intervention of Murad Ault. 

The conceit is flattering to human nature, but 
it is not borne out by the performance of human 
nature in what is called the business world, 
which is in such intimate alliance with the social 
world in such great centres of conflict as Lon- 
don, New York, or Chicago. Mr. Ault is every- 
where an integral and necessary part of the pre- 
vailing system — that is, the system by which the 
moral law is applied to business. The system, 




 

perhaps, cannot be defended, but it cannot be ex- 
plained without Mr. Ault. "We may argue that 
such a man is a disturber of trade, of legitimate 
operations, of the fairest speculations, but when 
we see how uniform he is as a phenomenon, we 
begin to be convinced that he is somehow in- 
dispensable to the system itself. We cannot ex- 
actly understand why a cyclone should pick up 
a peaceful village in Nebraska and deposit it in 
Kansas, where there is already enough of that 
sort, but we cannot conceive of "Wall Street con- 
tinuing to be "Wall Street unless it were now and 
then visited by a powerful adjuster like Mr. Ault. 
The advent, then, of Murad Ault in N'ew 
York was not a novelty, but a continuation of 
like phenomena in the Street, ever since the day 
when ingenious men discovered that the ability 
to guess correctly which of two sparrows, sold 
for a farthing, lighting on the spire of Trinity 
Church, will fly first, is an element in a success- 
ful and distinguished career. There was nothing 
peculiar in kind in his career, only in the force 
exhibited which lifted him among the few whose 
destructive energy the world condones and ad- 
mires as Napoleonic. He may have been an in- 
strument of Providence. "When we do not know 
exactly what to do with an exceptional . man 
who is disagreeable, we call him an Instrument 

of Providence. 





 

It is not, then, in anything exceptional that we 
are interested in the operations of Murad Ault, 
but simply on account of his fortuitous connec- 
tion with a great fortune which had its origin 
in very much the same cyclonic conditions that 
Mr. Ault revelled in. Those who know Wall 
Street best, by reason of sad experience, say that 
the presiding deity there is not the Chinese 
god, Luck, but the awful pagan deity, Nemesis. 
Alas ! how many innocent persons suflPer in order 
to get justice done in this world. 

Those who have unimpaired memories may 
recollect the fortune amassed, many years pre- 
vious to this history, by one Rodney Henderson, 
gathered and enlarged by means not indictable, 
but which illustrate the wide divergence between 
the criminal code and the moral law. This fort- 
une, upon the sudden death of its creator, had 
been largely diverted from its charitable desti- 
nation by fraud, by a crime that would have 
fallen within the code if it had been known. 
This fortune had been enjoyed by those who 
seized it for many years of great social success, 
rising into acknowledged respectability and dis- 
tinction ; and had become the basis of the chance 
of social elevation, which is dear to the hearts of 
so many excellent people, who are compelled to 
wander about in a chaotic society that has no 
hereditary titles. It was this fortune, the stake 




 

in such an ambition, or perhaps destined in a 
new possessor to a nobler one, that came in the 
way of Mr. Ault's extensive schemes. 

It is not necessary to infer that Mr. Ault was 
originally actuated by any greed as to this special 
accumulation of property, or that he had any 
malevolence towards Mr. Mavick ; but the eager- 
ness of his personal pursuit led him into collisions. 
There were certain possessions of Mr. Mavick 
that were desirable for the rounding-out of his 
plans — these graspings were many of them under- 
stood by the public as necessary to the " develop- 
ment of a system " — and in this collision of in- 
terests and fierce strength a vindictive feeling 
was engendered, a feeling born, as has been 
hinted, by Mr. Mavick's attempt to trick his 
temporary ally in a certain operation, so that Mr. 
Ault's main purpose was to "down Mavick." 
This was no doubt an exaggeration concerning a 
man with so many domestic virtues as Mr. Ault, 
meaning by domestic virtues indulgence of his 
family ; but a fight for place or property in poli- 
tics or in the Street is pretty certain to take on 
a personal character. 

We can understand now why Mr. Ault read 
the accounts of the Mavick ball with a grim 
smile. In speaking of it he used the vulgar term 
" splurge," a word especially offensive to the re- 
fined society in which the Mavicks had gained a 




 

foothold. And yet the word was on the lips of 
a great many men on the Street. The shifting 
application of sympathy is a very queer thing in 
this world. Mr. Ault was not a snob. What- 
ever else he was, he made few pretensions. In 
his first advent he had been resisted as an in- 
truder and shunned as a vulgarian ; but in time 
respect for his force and luck mingled with fear 
of his reckless talent, and in the course of events 
it began to be admitted that the rough diamond 
was being polished into one of the corner-stones 
of the great business edifice. At the time of this 
writing he did not altogether lack the sympathy 
of the Street, and an increasing number of people 
were not sorry to see Mr. Mavick get the worst 
of it in repeated trials of strength. And in each 
of these trials it became increasingly difficult for 
Mr. Mavick to obtain the assistance and the credit 
which are often indispensable to the strongest 
men in a panic. 

The truth was that there were many men in
