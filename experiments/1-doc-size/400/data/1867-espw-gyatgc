sun," said the quiet room-mate, creeping into 
bed. 




Gypsy pulled down the curtain, and began 
to undress with a jerk. 

Long after she was in bed, with her eyes 
shut, she seemed to see the black mantelpiece 
and the staring, pktureless walls, and the trees 



tossing out in the rain. Long after she was in 
bed, she saw the fire in the parlour grate at 
home, the little hair-cloth rocking-chair, and 
the empty cricket. The room-mate, who was 
not Maude Clare, was crying softly though 
that she did not knew on the pillow beside 
her. 

The -year at the Golden Crescent began to 
look very black. 



YOU BLESSED LITTLE 
MOTHER, You never 
did ! No, I know you 
never did, for all the 

people you went to boarding-school with wear 
little pugs to their hair behind, and have a 
baby with whooping-cough ; besides, there 
msn't any Maude Clare. 

I think it 's perfectly mag. at the Golden 
Crescent, and I 'll tell you why. It poured 
pitchforks all day Tuesday, that isn't why, 
but I 'm coming to it sometime, if I live long 
enough, and don't forget it, and you 'd better 
believe that I had on blue very delicate sky 



blue spectacles before night. Besides, I lost 
my luncheon, and was hungry enough to eat 
stewed marbles. Then I had to go and lose my 
trunk on top of it, and when that man came 
in jingling the check, didn't I want to see 
you? 

The trunk came back from the Junction 
Wednesday morning turned topsy-turvy, with the 
cork out of the cologne bottle. I mean the 
trunk was topsy-turvy, not Wednesday morn 
ing. Mrs. McMunn says I 'm careless with my 
commas. I meant to have written before, just 
as much as could be, that little scrap I sent 
off Wednesday, just to let you know I was 
alive, wasn't anything, but there hasn't been 
a minute. I have to study, and then Maude 
Clare comes in. But here I 've written three 
pages, and haven't told you a thing you want 
to know, and father will have such a quantity of 
questions about Mrs. McMunn and all. Let 
me see: 

Sfiapberry is a town situated somewhere in 
Massachusetts, upon the Snapberry River. It 



has five thousand inhabitants, six stores, three 
churches, a bridge, a de"pot, and a large number 
of minute boys with their mouths open. It is 
celebrated for its little coachmen, brown sugar, 
and pretty girls. 

The Golden Crescent is a select family school 
for young ladies; but twenty admitted, and 
usually nineteen on hand ; young ladies expected 
to supply their own napkin-rings, pillow-cases, 
and Oh, I forgot, there is a beauful row 
of yellow maples over on a hill behind the 
house, shaped just like a quarter of a moon, 
and when I woke up Wednesday morning, they 
were all blowing about in the sun, as if they 
were on fire. 

Mrs. McMunn is a widow, or else she isn't, 
and I don't know which. The girls say she was 
divorced from her husband, and that he is liv 
ing somewhere ; but they say she never speaks 
of him any more than if she had never had any. 
Mrs. McMunn is the funniest ! I really can't 
think of anything she looks like, but a barrel 
walking about with a very large Baldwin apple 



for a head. She is so stout the same size all 
the way up to her neck, and her cheeks are 
so red, and then she is freckled. Besides, her 
kid gloves don't fit, and her waterfall sticks out 
like a little feather, ever so far from her neck, 
and when she shakes her head at the girls, it 
nods about; they cut up, just so as to see it go. 
Besides, I can make her laugh, and then she 
sobers down and says, " Too much levity, Miss 
Breynton, too much levity," and then I nearly 
go off; when I laugh, the other girls all have to 
go and laugh too ; I 'm sure I don't see what 's 
the reason. 

Then there is Mademoiselle. It is so funny 
to hear her talk English. I don't see much of 
her, except in French Reader, and she is very 
quiet and stays in her own room. I don't know 
whether she 's lonely, or what. One girl in the 
class insists on calling le chat, lee shat, and puts 
poor Mademoiselle in an agony. Every time 
the cat is round, she will say, " Comment 's ap- 
pelle-t-il ce bite Id, Miss Holly? " and poor 
Miss Holly stammers and blushes, and is sure 



she has it right now, till she and the shat are 
sent off in disgrace. 

There are two other teachers, Miss Ayre 
and Chaplain Goss. Chaplain Goss attends 
prayers and Mathematics ; he wears green 
spectacles, and has a cough ; the girls plague 
him half out of his life, and when he wants to 
make them mind, he snaps his fingers at them : 
I do believe he knows that Algebra by heart, 
though, anyway. You ought to have seen him 
look at me this morning, when I said x was 
equal to 3, and it ought to have been some 
thing else, I 'm sure I don't know what. My ! 
you would have thought I was a chicken just 
out of the shell, running round with horrid little 
half-grown feathers on. 

Miss Ayre teaches Latin, Botany, and all those 
sorts of things. She talks 

on a funny little squeak ; 

she 's as thin as a pin and as cross as a bear. 

She always acts as if she were trying to make 

up for Mrs. McMunn, and she scolds when 

Mrs. McMunn laughs at the girls. 



Mrs. McMunn teaches History, and the big 
girls who are finishing up on Mental Philoso 
phy and Butler. What is Butler, some sort 
of a geography? She 's very pleasant, if she 
only would take down that waterfall. 

Oh, I forgot Mr. Schleiermacher, the music- 
teacher. He has a moustache and a diamond 
ring, and the girls put on their best dresses 
days when they take a music-lesson. I asked 
Maude Clare one day what she did it for, and 
she said her other was torn. 

And now I ve come to Maude Clare my 
beautiful, darling, precious Maude Clare. Isn't 
it a lovely name? and doesn't it sound just 
exactly like a novel? She says her mother 
found it in a book somewhere, and that it was 
the name of an heiress who was carried off by 
the Indians, and she had ever so many lovers, 
and they all came after her and brought her 
back ; I believe she married one of them with 
a rich uncle, and they went to Europe for their 
wedding tour. I think it must be a splendid story. 
Maude Clare says she had such passionate eyes. 



Maude Clare is splendid. She is as hand 
some as she can be, and so stylish why, you 
haven't any idea! She has more things just 
for this fall than I have in two years. 

Jacqueline Delancey doesn't think Maude is 
pretty, but that is just because she is pretty 
herself. I don't like Jacqueline Delancey. I 
saw her in the coach and I knew I should n t. 
She is afraid of things, and screams. Then she 
has little bits of hands and is always showing 
them off. Then she runs down Maude Clare. 

I like to watch Maude Clare dress. She 
moves her hands about in such a pretty way. 
She looks at my things sometimes out of the 
corners of her eyes, but she never laughs at 
them, the way Jack Delancey does, and that 's 
one reason why I like her. I don't mind being 
laughed at a bit, but then I 'd rather not. 

Maude Clare and I are going to be friends 
all our lives long, and she thinks ever so much 
of me, and I think ever so much of her. I like 
to braid her hair for her. She has seen ever so 
many gentlemen, and they all thought a great 



deal of her, and she tells me about them 
and she doesn't tell another soul. 

She and I are never going to marry, because 
we never could love our husbands as much as 
we do each other. Besides, I 'd a great deal 
rather have her than a husband, and besides, I 
wouldn't be married anyway. I think it 's 
horrid. Maude Clare and I always go to walk 
together, and I sit by her at table. 

I 'd give the world if we were room-mates, 
but Mrs. McMunn won't let us change now. 
Maude Clare rooms with poor Miss Holly on 
the second floor, and I 'm up here with Jane 
Bruce. Jane Bruce is very good, I guess, but 
she 's homely and she doesn't talk. She 's in 
mourning, but I never asked her for whom. I 
don't see much of her anyway, for we go right 
to sleep at night, and I 'm always in Maude 
Clare 's room out of study-hours. Maude likes 
to have me go down there because she says 
the stairs are crooked, and she doesn't like to 
climb up. 

Jo Courtis is another girl I know a little 

Her name is Josephine, but the girls call her 
Jo. She came from the West somewhere, and 
she talks very loud, and says funny things. 
When they don't call her Jo they call her 
Courtis, and she does seem like a boy. But 
then I sort of like her. 

There 's a lame girl named Phcebe Hand, 
who rooms on the first floor. She 's pale, and 
always looks frightened. I haven't seen much 
of her. There are a good many others, but 
most of them are in Jack Delancey 's set, and I 
don't go with them. 

Mrs. Holt is the housekeeper, and she 's cross. 
Nancy and Dolly are the Irish girls, and Nancy 
gave me some cold rice-pudding last night. 

I study Algebra and French and Latin; 
next term I 'm going to take Roman History. 
I only take one music-lesson a week, as you 
said, so I only have to give an hour a day to 
practising. I told Mr. Schleiermacher that you 
wanted me to give most of my time to my 
lessons, because that was what I came to school 
for. 




I don't think I have to study very hard. 

I was so homesick I thought I should go 
crazy Tuesday night, but Wednesday the sun 
shone, and Maude Clare made me laugh. I 
am having a splendid time, and think boarding- 
school 's the nicest thing in the world. 

Please pull father 's whiskers for me, and give 
Winnie a squeeze. I wrote to Tom yesterday. 

I haven't forgotten what I promised you up 
in my room in the dark. I 've gone to work 
and had a regular talk with you every night 
since I ve been here. Last night I 'd been eat 
ing peanuts all study-hours, and didn't want to 
a bit; but I did. I don't mean to eat any 
peanuts to-night. 

Your letter was magnificent. I 'm sorry 
Sarah Rowe has the measles. Do write very 
soon again to 

Your horrid little GYPSY. 

P. S. Maude Clare says Jacqueline Delan- 
cey is no lady, because she tries to show off her 

diamond ring ; it was only her father who gave 



it to her, but she wears it on her first finger, 
and tries to make people think she is engaged. 
Maude Clare is very particular, and wouldn't 
do an unladylike thing for a good deal. She 
means to make her father give her a diamond 
next Christmas. 

P. S. No. 2. The girls won't believe I wear 
my own hair, so I have to take it down and 
run round with it hanging, to let them see. 





YPSY was standing one morning at her window, watch 
ing that crescent of yellow 
maples, when Jacqueline Delancey called her. 
Those maples, by the way, were well worth 
watching. The light fell under them from the 
east, where the sun climbed the little hill, cut 
ting the outline of each separate leaf in flame. 
The wind and the frost had begun to twist off 
their rich, ripe stems, and the air was filled with 
them ; down on the grass, where the hoar-frost 
was heavy, they blazed like jewels. The swell 
of the curve was marked and rounded out by 
three blood-red trees, and the whole stood out 
sharply against a deep October sky. Gypsy 
always brought her books to this window, and 
did, I am inclined to think, quite as much look 




ing as studying. She spent much of her play 
time at this window, and sometimes forgot 
here even Maude Clare. It held a spell for 
her. 



But Jacqueline Delancey was calling. 

" Gypsy ! Gypsy Breynton ! Courtis, where 
is she? Has anybody seen her? Miss Breyn 
ton ! Gypsy ! " 

" Here ! " cried Gypsy, turning away with an 
impatient start from the window; the maples 
and Miss Delancey did not suit exactly. 
"Here I am. What 's up?" 

Jacqueline Delancey climbed the last stair, 
flew along the passage and through Gypsy 's 
opened door, with her breath gone. She 
tapped her throat with her pretty hands it 
was a fine opportunity to show them and sat 
down panting. 

" Well, you seem to be in a hurry," said 
Gypsy, eyeing her not very hospitably. 
" Don't sit on the bed, please. I don't like 
my bed tumbled. Take a chair by the fire?" 

Miss Delancey concluded that it was time to 
stop panting, took the chair, and observed in a 
very impressive manner that she had something 
to tell her. 

"Tell away," said Gypsy. 



" What do you suppose Maude Clare 's name 
is?" 

"Maude Clare, to be sure," said mystified 
Gypsy. 

" It 's Maude Clare as far as it goes, but that 
isn't the whole." 

" Not the whole ! " 

" No, I guess it isn't ! She has another 
name, and she 's ashamed of it I 'm sure I 
don't blame her, for the matter of that," said 
Miss Delancey, making a gigantic effort to look 
sarcastic, with about the success that a wax 
doll would have under similar circumstances.
