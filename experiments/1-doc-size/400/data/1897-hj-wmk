high interest." She had more than once re- 
marked that his affairs were sadly involved, 
but that they must get him Maisie and she 
together apparently into Parliament. The 
child took it from her with a flutter of impor- 
tance that Parliament was his natural sphere, 
and she was the less prepared to recognize a 
hindrance as she had never heard of any 
affairs whatever that were not involved. She 
had, in the old days, once been told by Mrs. 
Beale that her very own were, and, with the 
refreshment of knowing that she had affairs, 
the information had n't in the least over- 
whelmed her. It was true, and perhaps a little 
alarming, that she had never heard of any 
such matters since then. Full of charm, at 
any rate, was the prospect of some day get- 
ting Sir Claude in ; especially after Mrs. 
Wix, as the fruit of more midnight colloquies, 
once went so far as to observe that she really 
believed it was all that was wanted to save 
him. Mrs. Wix, with these words, struck her 
pupil as cropping up, after the manner of 
mamma when mamma talked, quite in a new 
place ; and the child stared as at the jump of 
a kangaroo. 

" Save him from what? " 

Mrs. Wix hesitated ; then she covered a 





still greater distance. " Why, my dear, just 
from awful misery." 



XII 

SHE had at the moment not explained her 
ominous speech, but the light of remarkable 
events soon enabled her companion to read 
it. It may indeed be said that these days 
brought on a high quickening of Maisie's 
direct perceptions, of her gratified sense of 
arriving by herself at conclusions. This was 
helped by an emotion intrinsically far from 
sweet the increase of the alarm that had 
most haunted her meditations. She had no 
need to be told, as on the morrow of the 
revelation of Sir Claude's danger she was told 
by Mrs. Wix, that her mother wanted more 
and more to know why the devil her father 
did n't send for her. She had too long ex- 
pected that mamma's curiosity on this point 
would break out with violence. Maisie could 
meet such pressure so far as meeting it was 
to be in a position to reply, in words directly 
inspired, that papa would be hanged before 
he 'd again be saddled with her. She there- 
fore recognized the hour that in troubled 





glimpses she had long foreseen, the hour 
when the phrase for it came back to her 
from Mrs. Beale with two fathers, two 
mothers and two homes, six protections in 
all, she should n't know " wherever " to go. 
Such apprehension as she felt on this score 
was not diminished by the fact that Mrs. Wix 
herself was suddenly white with terror a 
circumstance leading Maisie to the further 
knowledge that this lady was still more 
scared on her own behalf than on that of her 
pupil. A governess who had only one frock 
was not likely to have either two fathers or 
two mothers ; accordingly, if even with these 
resources Maisie was to be in the streets, 
where in the name of all that was dreadful 
was poor Mrs. Wix to be? She had had, 
it appeared, a tremendous brush with Ida, 
which had begun and ended with the request 
that she would be pleased, on the spot, to 
" bundle." It had come suddenly, but com- 
pletely, this signal of which she had gone in 
fear. The companions confessed to each 
other their long foreboding, but Mrs. Wix 
was better off than Maisie in having a plan 
of defence. She declined indeed to commu- 
nicate it till it was quite mature ; but mean- 
while, she hastened to declare, her feet were 





firm in the schoolroom. They could only be 
loosened by force ; she would " leave " for the 
police, perhaps, but she would n't " leave " 
for mere outrage. That would be to play 
her ladyship's game, and it would take 
another turn of the screw to make her desert 
her darling. Her ladyship had come down 
with extraordinary ferocity : it had been one 
of many symptoms of a situation strained 
" between them all," as Mrs. Wix said, " but 
especially between the two " to the point 
of God only knew what ! 

Her description of the crisis made the child 
reflect. "Between which two? papa and 
mamma?" 

" Dear, no. I mean between your mother 
and him" 

Maisie, in this, recognized an opportunity 
to be really deep. " Him? Mr. Perriam? " 

She fairly brought a blush to the scared 
face. " Well, my dear, I must say that what 
you don't know ain't worth mentioning. 
That it won't go on forever with Mr. Perriam 
since I must meet you who can sup- 
pose? But I meant dear Sir Claude." 

Maisie stood corrected rather than abashed. 
"I see. But it's about Mr. Perriam he's 
angry?" 





Mrs. Wix hesitated. " He says he 's 
not." 

" Not angry? He has told you so? " 

Mrs. Wix looked at her hard. " Not about 
him." 

" Then about some one else?" 

Mrs. Wix looked at her harder. "About 
some one else." 

" Lord Eric? " the child promptly brought 
forth. 

At this, of a sudden, her governess was 
more agitated. " Oh, why, little unfortunate, 
should we discuss their dreadful names?" 
and she threw herself for the millionth time 
on Maisie's neck. It took her pupil but a 
moment to feel that she quivered with insecu- 
rity, and, the contact of her terror aiding, the 
pair, in another instant, were sobbing in each 
other's arms. Then it was that, completely 
relaxed, demoralized as she had never been, 
Mrs. Wix suffered her wound to bleed and 
her resentment to gush. Her great bitter- 
ness was that Ida had called her false, de- 
nounced her hypocrisy and duplicity, reviled 
her spying and tattling, her lying and grovel- 
ling to Sir Claude. " Me, me ! " the poor 
woman wailed, " who've seen what I've seen 
and gone through everything only to cover 






her up and ease her off and smooth her 
down ! If I've been an 'ipocrite it 's the 
other way round : I've pretended to him and 
to her, to myself and to you and to every 
one, not to see ! It serves me right to have 
held my tongue before such horrors ! " What 
horrors they were her companion forbore 
too closely to inquire, showing even signs 
not a few of an ability to take them for 
granted. That put the couple more than 
ever, in this troubled sea, in the same boat, 
so that with the consciousness of ideas on 
the part of her fellow-mariner Maisie could 
sit close and wait. Sir Claude on the morrow 
came in to tea, and then the ideas were pro- 
duced. It was extraordinary how the child's 
presence drew out their full richness. The 
principal one was startling, but Maisie appre- 
ciated the courage with which her governess 
handled it. It simply consisted of the pro- 
posal that whenever and wherever they 
should take refuge Sir Claude should consent 
to share their asylum. On his protesting 
with all the warmth in nature against this 
note of secession she asked what else in the 
world was left to them if her ladyship should 
stop supplies. 

" Supplies be hanged, my dear woman ! " 





said their delightful friend. " Leave supplies 
to me I 'll take care of supplies." 

Mrs. Wix hesitated. "Well, it's exactly 
because I knew you 'd be so glad to do so 
that I put the question before you. There 's 
a way to look after us better than any other. 
That way is just to come with us." 

It hung before Maisie, Mrs. Wix's way, 
like a glittering picture, and she clasped her 
hands in ecstasy. "Come with us come 
with us ! " she echoed. 

Sir Claude looked from his stepdaughter 
back to her governess. " Do you mean 
leave this house and take up my abode with 
you?" 

"It will be the right thing if you feel 
as you've told me you feel." Mrs. Wix, sus- 
tained and uplifted, was now as clear as a 
bell. 

Sir Claude had the air of trying to recall 
what he had told her; then the light broke 
that was always breaking to make his face 
more pleasant. " It 's your suggestion that 
I shall take a house for you?" 

" For the wretched homeless child. Any 
roof over our heads will do for us; but 
of course for you it will have to be something 
really nice." 





Sir Claude's eyes reverted to Maisie rather 
hard, as she thought ; and there was a shade 
in his very smile that seemed to show her 
though she also felt it didn't show Mrs. Wix 
that the accommodation prescribed must 
loom to him pretty large. The next mo- 
ment, however, he laughed gayly enough. 
" My dear lady, you exaggerate tremen- 
dously my poor little needs." Mrs. Wix had 
once mentioned to her young friend that 
when Sir Claude called her his dear lady 
he could do anything with her; and Maisie 
felt a certain anxiety to see what he would 
do now. Well, he only addressed her a 
remark of which the child herself was aware 
of feeling the force. " Your plan appeals 
to me immensely; but of course don't 
you see ? I shall have to consider the posi- 
tion I put myself in by leaving my wife." 

" You 'll also have to remember," Mrs. 
Wix replied, " that if you don't look out 
your wife won't give you time to consider. 
Her ladyship will leave you'' 

" Ah, my good friend, I do look out," 
the young man returned while Maisie helped 
herself afresh to bread and butter. " Of 
course if that happens I shall have somehow 
to turn round ; but I hope with all my heart 





it won't. I beg your pardon," he continued 
to his stepdaughter, "for appearing to dis- 
cuss that sort of possibility under your sharp 
little nose. But the fact is that I forget half 
the time that Ida is your sainted mother." 

" So do I ! " said Maisie, to put him the 
more in the right. 

Her protectress, at this, was upon her 
again. " The little desolate, precious pet ! " 
For the rest of the conversation she was 
enclosed in Mrs. Wix's arms, and as they 
sat there interlocked Sir Claude, before them 
with his teacup, looked down at them in 
deepening thought. Shrink together as they 
might they could n't help, Maisie felt, being 
a very massive image, a large, loose, ponder- 
ous presentment of what Mrs. Wix required 
of him. She knew moreover that this lady 
did n't make it better by adding in a moment : 
" Of course we should n't dream of a whole 
house. Any sort of little lodging, however 
humble, would be only too blessed." 

" But it would have to be something that 
would hold us all," said Sir Claude. 

" Oh, yes," Mrs. Wix concurred ; " the 
whole point is our being together. While 
you 're waiting, before you act, for her lady- 
ship to take some step, our position here 





will come to an impossible pass. You don't 
know what I went through with her for you 
yesterday and for our poor darling; but 
it's not a thing I can promise you often 
to face again. She has dismissed me in 
horrible language she has instructed the 
servants not to wait on me." 

" Oh, the poor servants are all right ! " Sir 
Claude eagerly cried. 

" They 're certainly better than their mis- 
tress ! It 's too dreadful that I should sit 
here and say of your wife, Sir Claude, and 
of Maisie's own mother, that she's lower 
than a domestic; but my being betrayed 
into such remarks is just a reason the more 
for our getting away. I shall stay till I 'm 
taken by the shoulders, but that may happen 
any day. What also may perfectly happen, 
you must permit me to repeat, is that she 'll 
go off to get rid of us." 

" Oh, if she 'll only do that ! " Sir Claude 
laughed. "That would be the very making 
of us ! " 

"Don't say itdon't say it! " Mrs. Wix 
pleaded. " Don't speak of anything so fatal ! 
You know what I mean. We must all cling 
to the right. You must n't be bad." 

Sir Claude set down his teacup ; he had 





become more grave and he pensively wiped 
his moustache. " Won't all the world say 
I 'm awful if I leave the house before 
before she has bolted? They'll say it was 
my doing that made her bolt." 

Maisie could grasp the force of this rea- 
soning, but it offered no check to Mrs. Wix. 
" Why need you mind that if you've done 
it for so high a motive ? Think of the beauty 
of it," the good lady pressed. 

" Of bolting with you?" Sir Claude ejacu- 
lated. 

She faintly smiled she even faintly col- 
ored. " So far from doing you harm it will 
do you the highest good. Sir Claude, if 
you 'll listen to me, it will save you." 

" Save me from what? " 

Maisie, at this question, waited with re- 
newed suspense for an answer that would 
bring the thing to a finer point than their 
companion had brought it to before. But 
there was, on the contrary, only more mys- 
tification in Mrs. Wix's reply. "Ah, from 
you know what ! " 

" Do you mean from some other woman?" 

" Yes from a real bad one." 

Sir Claude, at least, the child could see,
