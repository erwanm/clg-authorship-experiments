On the trail closely examining; then said,
"I've got the direction — come along; take 
the lantern, somebody." 
He strode off swiftly southward. 
The files following, swaying and bending 
in and out with the deep curves 
of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the 
mouth of the gorge was reached; 
before them stretched the sage-brush 
Following an plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman 
called a halt, saying, "We mustn't 
start wrong, now; we must take the 
direction again.'' He took a lantern 
and examined the ground for a matter 
of twenty yards; then said, "Come 
on; it's all right," and gave up the 
lantern. In and out among the sage- 
bushes he marched, a quarter of a 
mile, bearing gradually to the right; 
then took a new direction and made 
another great semicircle; then changed 
again and moved due west nearly 
half a mile — and stopped. 
"She gave it up, here, poor little 
chap. Hold the lantern. You can 
see where she sat' 
But this was in a slick alkali flat 
which was surfaced like steel, and no 
person in the party was quite hardy 
enough to claim an eyesight that 
could detect the track of a cushion 
on a veneer like that. The bereaved 
mother fell upon her knees and kissed 
the spot, lamenting. 
"But where is she, then?'' some 
one said. "She didn't stay here. 
We can see that much, anyway." 
Stillman moved about in a circle 
around the place, with the lantern, 
pretending to hunt for tracks. " Well ! ' ' 
he said presently, in an annoyed 
tone, "I don't understand it." He 
examined again. ''No use. She was 
here — that's certain; she never walked 
away from here — and that's certain. 
It's a puzzle; I can't make it out." 
The mother lost heart then. 
"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! 
some flying beast has got her. I'll 
never see her again!" 
"Ah, don't give up," said Archy. 
"We'll find her— don't give up." 
"God bless you for the words, 
Archy Stillman!" and she seized his 
hand and kissed it fervently. 
Peterson, the new-comer, whispered 
satirically in Ferguson's ear: 
"Wonderful performance to find 
this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth 
while to come so far, though; any 
other supposititious place would have 
answered just as well — hey?" 
Ferguson was not pleased with 
the innuendo. He said, with some 
warmth : ' 
"Do you mean to insinuate that 
the child hasn't been here? I tell 
you the child has been here! Now 
if you want to get yourself into as 
tidy a little fuss as — '' 
''All right!" sang out Stillman 
"Come, everybody, and look at this! 
It was right under our noses all the 
time, and we didn't see it' 
There was a general plunge for 
the ground at the place where the 
child was alleged to have rested, and 
many eyes tried hard and hopefully to 
see the thing that Archy's finger was 
resting upon. There was a pause, 
then a several-barrelled sigh of disappointment. 
Pat Riley and Ham 
Sandwich said, in the one breath: 
"What is it, Archy? There's nothing 
here.' 
"Nothing? Do you call that noth- 
ing?'' and he swiftly traced upon 
the ground a form with his finger. 
"There — don't you recognize it now? 
It's Injim Billy's track. He's got 
the child." 
"God be praised!" from the mother. 
"Take away the lantern. I've got 
the direction. Follow!" 
He started on a run, racing in and 
out among the sage-bushes a matter 
of three hundred yards, and disap- 
peared over a sand-wave; the others 
struggled after him, caught him up, 
and foimd him waiting. Ten steps 
 
away was a little wickieup, a dim 
and formless shelter of rags and old 
horse-blankets, a dull light showing 
through its chinks. 
''You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the 
lad. ''It's your privilege to be 
first." 
All followed the sprint she made 
for the wickieup, and saw, with her, 
the picture its interior afforded. Injun 
Billy was sitting on the ground; tost one 
the child was asleep beside him. The 
mother hugged it with a wild embrace, 
which included Archy Stillman, the 
grateful tears running down her face, 
and in a choked and broken voice 
she poured out a golden stream of 
that wealth of worshipping endear- 
ments which has its home in full
richness nowhere but in the Irish 
he. 
" I find her b3nneby it is ten oclock' 
Billy explained. " She 'sleep out yon- 
der, ve'y tired — face wet, been cry- 
Injan's' spose; fetch her home, feed her, 
she heap much hungry — go 'sleep.'
In her limitless gratitude the happy 
mother waived rank and hugged him 
too, calling him ''the angel of God 
in disguise." 
And he probably was in disguise 
if he was that kind of an official. He 
was dressed for the character. 
At half past one in the morning 
the procession burst into the village, 
singing " When Johnny Comes March- 
ing Home," waving its lanterns, and 
swallowing the drinks that were 
brought out all along its course. It  
concentrated at the tavern, and made  
a night of what was left of the morning. 
I 
HE next afternoon the 
village was electrified 
with an immense sen- 
sation. A grave and 
dignified foreigner of distinguished 
bearing and appearance had arrived 
at the tavern, and entered this for 
midable name upon the register: 
Sherlock Holmes. 
The news buzzed from cabin to 
cabin, from claim to claim; tools 
were dropped, and the town swarmed 
toward the centre of interest. A man 
passing out at the northern end of 
the village shouted it to Pat Riley, 
whose claim was the next one to 
Flint Buckner's. At that time Fet- 
lock Jones seemed to turn sick. He 
muttered to himself: 
" Uncle Sherlock I The mean luck 
of it I — that he should come just 
when , . ." He dropped into a rev- 
erie, and presently said to himself: 
"But what's the use of being afraid 
of him? Anybody that knows him 
the way I do knows he can't detect a 
crime, except when he plans it all out 
beforehand and arranges the clews 
and hires some fellow to commit 
it according to instructions. . . . 
Now there ain't going to he any clews 
this time — so, what show has he got? 
None at all. No, sir; everything's 
ready. If I was to risk putting it 
off. . . . No, I won't run any risk like 
that. Flint Buckner goes out of this 
world to-night, for sure." Then an- 
other trouble presented itself. "Un- 
cle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk 
home matters with me this evening, 
and how am I going to get rid of him? 
for I've got to be at my cabin a minute  
or two about eight o'clock." This 
was an awkward matter, and cost 
him much thought. But he found 
a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll 
go for a walk, and I'll leave him in 
the road a minute, so that he won't 
see what it is I do: the best way to 
throw a detective off the track, anyway, 
is to have him along when you 
are preparing the thing. Yes, that's 
the safest — I'll take him with me." 
Meantime the road in front of the 
tavern was blocked with villagers 
waiting and hoping for a glimpse of 
the g reat m an. But he kept his 
room, and did not appear. None 
but Ferguson, Jake Parker the black- 
smith, and Ham Sandwich had any 
luck. These enthusiastic admirers of 
the great scientific detective hired the 
tavern's detained - baggage lockup, 
which looked into the detective's room 
across a little alleyway ten or twelve 
feet wide, ambushed themselves in it, 
and cut some peep-holes in the win- 
dow-blind. Mr. Holmes's blinds were 
down; but by-and-by he raised them. 
It gave the spies a hair-Hfting but 
pleasurable thrill to find themselves 
face to face with the Extraordinary 
Man who had filled the world with 
the fame of his more than human 
ingenuities. There he sat — not a 
m3i:h, not a shadow, but real, alive, 
compact of substance, and almost 
within touching distance with the 
hand. 
''Look at that head!'' said Fergu- 
son, in an awed voice. ".By:£raciQus ! 
that's a head!'' 
"ybuTbetr said the blacksmith, 
with deep reverence. "Look at his 
nose! look at his eyes! Intellect? 
Just a battery of it!'' 
"And that paleness," said Ham 
Sandwich. ''Comes from thought — 
that's what it comes from. Hell! 
duffers like us .don't knoLwhat real 
thought is." 
"No more we don't' said Fergu- 
son. "What we take for thinking 
is just blubber-and-slush. " 
" Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And 
look at that frown — that's deep think- 
ing — away down, down, forty fathom 
into the bowels of things. He's on 
the track of something." 
"Well, he is, and don't you forget 
it. Say — look at that awful gravity 
— look at that pallid solemness — there 
ain't any corpse can lay over it." 
" No, sir, not for dollars ! And 
it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; 
he's been dead four times a'ready, 
and there's historyiior it. Three 
times natural, once by accident. Fve 
heard say he smells damp and colS, 
like a grave. And he — " 
""ShTlVatch him I There — he's 
got his thumb on the btmip on the 
near corner of his forehead, and his 
forefinger on the off one. His think- Grind- 
works is just 3.- grinding now, you bet - 
your other shirt." 
"That's so. And now he's gazing 
up toward heaven and stroking his 
mustache slow, and — '' 
"Now he has rose up standing, 
and is putting his clews together on 
his left fingers with his right finger. 
See? he touches the forefinger — now 
middle finger — now ring-finger — '* 
"Stuck!" 
"Look at him scowl! He can't 
seem to make out thxit clew. So he — '' 
"See him smile! — like a tiger — 
and tally off the other fingers like 
nothing! He's got it, boys; he's 
got it sure!" 
"Well, I should say! Td hate to 
be in that man's place that he's after." 
Mr. Holmes drew a table to the 
window, sat down with his back to 
the spies, and proceeded to write. 
The spies withdrew their eyes from 
the peep-holes, Ht their pipes, and 
settled themselves for a comfortable 
smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with 
conviction : 
"Boys, it's no use talking, he's 
a wonder! He's got the signs of it 
all over him." 
''You hain't ever said a truer 
word than that, Wells-Fargo' said 
Jake Parker. "Say, wouldn't it 'a' 
been nuts if he'd a -been here last 
night?" 
"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" 
said Ferguson. "Then we'd have Sden- 
seen scientific work. Intellect — just
pure intellect — away up on the upper '" 
levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all 
right, and it don't become anybody 
to belittle him, I can tell you. But 
his gift is only just eyesight, sharp 
as an owl's, as near as I can make it 
out just a grand natural animal tal- 
ent, no more, no less, and prime as 
far as it goes, but no intellect in it, 
and for awfulness and marvellousness 
no more to be compared to what 
this man does than — than — Why, 
let me tell you what he'd have done. 
He'd have stepped over to Hogan's 
and glanced — just glanced, that's all 
— at the premises, and that's enough. 
See everything? Yes, sir, to the 
last little cfetail; and he'd know more 
about that place than the Hogans 
would know in seven years. Next, 
method   
he would sit down on the bunk, just 
as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan — 
Say, Ham, consider that you are 
Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; 
you answer them." 
"All right; goon." 
"Madam, if you please — attention 
— do not let your mind wander. Now, 
then — sex of the child?" 
"Female, your Honor." 
" Um — female. Very good, very 
good. Age?- . 
"Turned six, your Honor." " 
" Um — yoimg, weak — two miles. 
Weariness will overtake it then. It 
will sink down and sleep. We shall 
find it two miles away, or less. 
Teeth?" 
" Five, your Honor, and one a-coming." 
"Very good, very good, very good 
indeed. You see, boys, he knows a 
clew when he sees it, when it wouldn't 
mean a dem thing to anybody else. 
Stockings, madam? Shoes?'' 
"Yes, your Honor — both." 
"Yam, perhaps? Morocco?" 
"Yam, your Honor. And kip." 
"Um — kip. This complicates the 
matter. However, let it go — we shall 
manage. Religion?'' 
And 
then I '' Catholic, your Honor. '' 
"Very good. Snip me a bit from 
the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. 
Part wool — foreign make. Very well. 
A snip from some garment of the 
child's, please. Thanks. Cotton. 
Shows wear. An excellent clew, 
excellent. Pass me a pellet of the 
floor dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, 
many thanks. Ah, admirable, ad- 
mirable! Now we know where we 
are, I think. You see, boys, he's 
got all the clews he wants now; he 
don't need anything more. Now, 
then, what does this Extraordinary 
Man do? He lays those snips and 
that dirt out on the table and leans 
over them on his elbows, and puts 
them together side by side and 
studies them — mumbles to himself, 
'Female'; changes them around — 
mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes 
them this way and that — again mum- 
bles : ' Five teeth — one a-coming — 
Catholic — yarn — cotton — kip — thinking 
damn that kip Then he straight- 
ens up and gazes toward heaven, 
and ploughs his hands through his 
hair — ploughs and ploughs, mutter- 
ing, ' Damn that kip ! ' Then he stands 
up and frowns, and begins to tally 
off his clews on his fingers — and gets 
stuck at the ring-finger. But only 
just a minute — then his face glares 
all up in a smile like a house afire, 
and he straightens up stately and 
majestic, and says to the crowd, ' Take 
a lantern, a couple of you, and go 
down to Injun Billy's and fetch the 
child — the rest of you go 'long home 
to bed; good-night, madam; good- 
night, gents And he bows like the 
Matterhorn, and pulls out for the 
Edsy style tavern. That's his style, 
and the only — scientific, intellectual — 
all over in fifteen minutes — no poking around 
all over the sage-brush range an hour 
and a half in a mass-meeting crowd 
for him, boys — you hear me !" 
''By Jackson, it's grand!" said 
Ham Sandwich. '' Wells-Fargo, you've 
got him down to a dot. He ain't 
painted up any exacter to the life in
