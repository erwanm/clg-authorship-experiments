Something in Katliie’s voice touched Rob, but he 
turned rather ungraciously. 

“ What a nuisance girls are ! ” he said, crossly. 

“ No, they are n’t,” Charlie exclaimed, valiantly ; 
“ and Katliie ’s the nicest girl I know. I wish I had 
such a sister. Only you might have ridden down 
once , Kathie.” 

As if Rob was afraid she would yield now, he hur- 
ried her away. She took Freddy by the hand, clasp- 
ing the chubby little fingers in her own. 

“ I mean to tease mother to let me come out again 
to-night,” Rob said presently. “ All the boys will 
be there.” 

“ But you know mamma doesn’t like you to go 
out evenings with the boys,” Kathie said in a grave, 
sweet voice. 

“ It ’s hard if a fellow has to stay in forever ” ; and 
Rob gave a hummock of ice a tremendous kick. 

Kathie made no reply just then, but she was re- 
volving something in her mind. Presently she said, 
with her heart in her throat, “ Rob, I wish you ’d do 
something partly for me instead.” 


 


“ What ? ” The tone was rather cold and discour- 
aging. 

“ Mamma will have to go to Mrs. Grayson’s this 
evening, and I wish you would go with her. It will 
make the walk seem shorter, and it ’s so lonesome to 
go about in the dark. It ’s my fault, for I read my 
fairy-book this afternoon when I should have gone.” 

“ Bother ! I wish you ’d attend to your own busi- 
ness ! ” 

The quick tears rushed to Kathie’s eyes. “ I ’m 
very sorry, Bob, but I went to the grocery and 
brought home a heavy basketful. You know you 
said you ’d always go.” 

“ Well, why didn’t you call me ? ” and at this kick 
the frozen snow flew in a shower. 

“ Mamma was in a hurry.” After a pause and 
with a great effort she said, kindly, “ Bob, you may 
have my paint-box on the first rainy day.” Kathie’s 
teacher had given her a box of paints for Christmas. 
A day or two after, when it rained, and Bob had to 
stay in the house, he insisted upon taking forcible 
possession, he being rather masterly and aggressive. 

“They are Kathie’s,” his mother said, “and you 
have no right to them unless she gives it to you.” 


 


Kathie didn’t seem that way inclined. They were 
so bright and fresh, and the box so clean, that she 
hated to have them used. 

bob said nothing now, but washed his hands and 
ate his supper in a quiet manner. 

“ I ’ll wash the dishes, mamma,” and Kathie began 
cheerily enough, tucking up her sleeves above her 
dimpled elbows, “ so you can go right away.” 

Mrs.. Alston looked pleased and put on her shawl. 

“ I am going along, so that no one will run away 
with you,” bob announced with an assumption of 
manliness. 

“ Are you ? O, thank you.” 

bob felt repaid by his mother’s smile and the soft 
color that stole into her cheeks. How pretty she 
would be if she wasn’t so thin and pale ! 

Then Freddy thought he ought to go, though the 
warm room and the warm tea had made him look 
rather sleepy ; besides, he was too small a boy to take 
such a tramp after supper. 

“ I'll put you to bed and tell you a story,” whis- 
pered Kathie as the others went away. 

Kathie didn’t like to wasli dishes, but she went at it 
cheerfully, and it was surprising how soon she seemed 


 


to get through. Then she brushed up the room, drew 
Aunt Eutli’s chair to the table, for she was an almost 
helpless invalid, and found her sewing-materials. 
Fred was nodding in the corner by this time, and was 
rather cross when she roused him, but after she had 
him tucked snugly in bed he remembered the story. 
She wrapped a shawl around her, and, sitting on the 
edge of the bed, commenced in a clear, happy voice ; 
but while the princess was yet in her enchanted castle, 
and the prince taken in the toils of some old witch so 
that he couldn’t come to her rescue, Fred gave a little 
crooked snore ; so Katliie pulled the pillow straight, 
and left him sleeping soundly. 

There sat pale, patient Aunt Euth embroidering. 
If there only were fairies, and one could touch her 
with a golden wand and make her well ! 

“ Aunt Euth, isn’t it a pity fairy-stories are not 
true ? ” she asked. 

“ I think some of them are.” 

“ But no one has a wand that can transform other 
people, or cure them, or give them elegant houses to 
live in. And there never was a purse like that of 
Fortunatus.” 

Aunt Euth smiled. “ I think I have seen Cinderellas,” 
she said,  and giant-killers, and people in en- 
chanted castles who were set free at last, and girls 
who dropped something better than pearls and dia- 
monds when they spoke.” 

“ But the people in enchanted castles, tell me 
about them ” ;  and Kathies eyes were wide open with 
curiosity. “ Where did you see them ? ” 

“Well, I think some brownie or ill-natured fairy 
put them in a dismal castle, and sometimes they were 
angry and wouldn’t see the right way to get out. The 
fairy blinded them, I suppose, for they kicked and 
thumped against the walls, and sought every way but 
the right one, and then their eyes were opened sud- 
denly, and they saw how many wrong ways they had 
been trying.” 

“ Oh, that ’s children,” said Katliie, with a laugh. 
“ I mean real fairies.” 

“ Well, I saw a real fairy awhile ago. A little 
girl who did several things that she sometimes con- 
siders great hardships. She was cheerful and patient, 
and made everything go along smoothly by some 
words that were better than diamonds.” 

“O Aunt Buth!” Some tender tears came in 
Katliie’s eyes. Then she was quiet for many moments, 




 


thinking. She could not transport them all to an 
elegant palace, nor have servants come at her call, 
but she remembered the real fairies there were in the 
world, — Love, to begin with, a spirit who was tender, 
patient, self-sacrificing, never cross when things went 
wrong, never indolent when others could be saved any 
toil or burden. 

“ Oh,” she thought, with a sigh, “ I never can be such 
a fairy ” ; and she felt very humble. “ But I might try 
to do a little.” Then she remembered she had heard 
Rob ask mamma that morning to mend his gray mit- 
tens. So she went to the closet-shelf, where she had 
seen him lay them. 

“ What are you looking for ? ” Aunt Ruth said, after 
a little. 

“ Mamma’s balls of yarn. I want to mend Rob’s 
mittens, if you will show me.” 

“ The balls are on a lower shelf, in a basket.” 

“ Oh yes ; I wish I didn’t forget everything, Aunt 
Ruth.” 

“ You must pay more attention, and think when 
you start to do anything.” 

She sat down by Aunt Ruth and began to darn. It 
was rather tedious to do it so neatly, and Kathie 


 


was not very fond of being quiet, so by and by she 
said, “ Aunt Rutli, I ’d like to talk about the giant- 
killers — I think I never saw any — and the giants.” 
“ There are a great many giants in the world. In- 
dolence, Ill-Temper, Envy, Selfishness, and more than 
I can mention. Some people only thrust them out 
of sight for a while, but I have met with several 
good honest Jacks who kept at them until they 
were killed. Giants like these spring up everywhere. 
We all have to fight them.” 

“ Do you, Aunt Ruth ? ” and Ivathie looked up 
wonderingly. 

“ Do you always feel patient and sweet-tempered, 
Ivathie ? Are you always willing to give up your 
own pleasure for the sake of others ? ” 

“ Oh no ” ; and Ivathie could not forbear smiling at 
the thought. “ But you are so good.” 

“ I have some giants to fight. And I call in the 
aid of such fairies as will help me.” 

“ Oh Aunt Ruth, it is hard to stay here day after 
day, and not be able to walk out, nor rich enough to 
ride, and then have to work all the time. I oimht to 
be your good little fairy, and mamma’s. Perhaps I 
can do something to make it brighter and easier.” 


 


“ You can do a great deal.” 

“ Aunt Ruth, these mittens are finished. It seemed 
so much when I first began.” 

“ And it is very neatly done. You ’re almost a 
fairy ” ; and Aunt Euth kissed her. A warm glow 
came to her face as she recalled her mother’s words. 
The fairies didn’t all live in enchanted palaces. 

“ Oh, there they come ! ” exclaimed Kathie, and, 
springing up, she put away the mittens. 

Eob returned in a state of felicity. 

“ I had a splendid talk with Dick Grayson,” he 
said, “ and he isn’t half so proud as the boys make 
out, although he does go to the Academy. He asked 
me to come over some evening, and Oh, Kathie, he 
has such lots of books, and a little study all by him- 
self, where he reads and tries experiments, and his 
father is so kind and pleasant. Mrs. Grayson praised 
me for not letting mamma go out alone, and I wanted 
to tell her it was your thought, not mine. I ’m so 
glad I went. And, Kathie, I shall not want the 
paints, at least not for pay.” 

“ You can have them to paint your boat,” she re- 
joined, yielding of her own free will a point that she 
had refused him several times. 


 


“ You ’re a darling ! ” exclaimed Kob, boy fashion. 

She took a long look at the star before she went 
to bed. Did it never get tired shining steadily on 
and on ? Didn’t it want to go to some other place 
or do something else, — become a sun or moon, for 
instance, as any little boy or girl would in its place ? 
God wanted it just to shine, and it did its duty. And 
he wanted her to be a helpful little girl, or else he 
would have given her a beautiful house, plenty of 
money, and nothing to do. There were princesses in 
the fairy stories who had everything they called for, 
but the real fairies ran to and fro, did as they were 
bidden, never complaining of hard work. A little 
while ago she was wishing to be a fairy, one of the 
working kind it must be. 

So she said her prayers reverently and crept into 
her little bed, thinking of the many things she wanted 
to do, and most of all to make life a little easier for 
dear, sweet mamma. There was no way of getting 
rich, so they must always toil. Wishing for purses 
of gold and mines of jewels wouldn’t bring about any 
result, but being cheerful and industrious might. 

“ I ’ll try and be a fairy,” she thought as she fell 
asleep. 


 


CHAPTER II. 

FINDING A GIANT. 

“ Mother, did you mend my mittens ? These are 
all in holes now ” ; and Rob held up his hands. 

“ I was so busy yesterday, and then going out in 
the evening — ” 

“ Here they are,” said Kathie ; “ I did it last night.” 

“ Tall darning ” ; and Rob laughed incredulously. 

“ Aunt Ruth showed me.” 

“ Why, mother, look ; she did it splendidly, — as 
nice and thick as yours. I hate thin darning ; it 
comes out right away.” Rob gave her a boisterous 
hug and kiss. 

“ Mamma, have you seen my basket ? I can’t find 
it anywhere ” ; and Kathie looked disconsolate. 

“ Didn’t you put it on the shelf ? ” 

“ It isn’t there,” was Kathie’s reply. 

“ Think what you did do with it then. You came 
directly home from school, didn’t you ? ” 

“Yes, mamma.” 


 


“ Well, I don’t see it anywhere; I hope you have 
not lost it.” 

Kathie looked sober. “ I believe I did leave it at 
school, mamma,” she said, at length. “ I ran out to 
speak to Mary Cox, and then I forgot all about it.” 

Kathie’s eyes met Aunt Ruth’s. “ There ’s one 
of the giants,” she thought. “ There ’s a battle to 
fight, just as I did last night, when I went back to 
the baker’s. I ’ll try to remember. That must be 
my first work.” 

Mrs. Alston put Kathie’s lunch in a napkin. She 
hurried to school, and was going straight to her desk, 
when she saw her basket hung on a high nail. That 
was a sign that it had been left out of place the pre- 
ceding evening. Miss Moore would mark her now 
for having been careless. 

Kathie took her seat very soberly. There were 
giants all around, it seemed ; for she felt rather cross 
with Miss Moore when it was plainly her own fault. 
How could she forget that she had put it somewhere 
around, and then not come after it ! And she had 
resolved not to have one bad mark this quarter ! 

Sophie Dorrance rushed in and deposited her books 
on her desk. 


 


“ O Kathie, they re beginning a snow-house ! 
Come out ; it ’ll be such fun.” 

“ No,” said Kathie, quietly ; “ I cannot just now” 

“ Why, are you sick ? ” 

“ No.” 

“ Why, then, are you angry with any one ? ” 

“ I was very careless ; so I ’m going to sit here for 
a punishment, to make me remember another time.” 

“ Who told you to ? ” 

“No one ; I am doing it myself. I forget so easily 
that I must do something to cure myself.”
