It held himself, first of all, standing in front, in plain
view much of the time. It held besides a group of men that one
liked to look at just then. General Scott was there, and I
know not how many other generals; the members of the Cabinet,
and inferior military officers; and each colonel of the
regiments that passed in review, after passing, dismounted and
joined the group on the platform. I looked at these officers
with particular interest, for they and their command were
going straight across into Virginia expecting active service
soon. So I looked at their men. While each regiment marched
by, the band belonging to it halted and played. They were
going to the war. In good earnest they were going now. This
was no show of pleasure; it was work; and my heart, it seemed
to me, alternately beat and stood still. Sometimes the
oppression of feeling grew very painful, obliged as I was to
hide carefully the greater part of what I felt. A little
additional stir was almost more than I could bear. One
regiment - the Garibaldis, I think, had bouquets of flowers
and greens in their hats. I did not indeed notice this, until
the foremost came just in front of the platform and the
President. Then the bouquets were taken out from the hats, and
were tossed, in military order, rank by rank, as the files
passed by, to Mr. Lincoln's feet. It was a little thing; but
how it shook me! I was glad of the rush which followed the
passing of the regiment; the rush of people eager to secure
these bunches of flowers and evergreens for memorials; the
diversion of interest for a moment gave me chance to fight
down my heart-swelling.

"Daisy! you are - what is the matter? You are not well - you
are tired," - my guardian exclaimed anxiously, as he came back
to my side with one of the Garibaldi flower bunches.

"I am well - you are mistaken, Dr. Sandford," I made myself
say quietly.

"For which side are you so anxious?" he inquired. "You are
paler than you ought to be, at this moment, with a smile on
your lips. I got this for you - will you scorn it, or value
it?"

"You would not waste it upon me, if you thought I would scorn
it?" I said.

"I don't know. I am not infatuated about anybody. You may have
the bouquet, Daisy. Will you have it?"

I did not want to have it! I was not amusing myself, as many
and as Mrs. Sandford were doing; this was not an interesting
little bit of greens to me, but a handful of pain. I held it,
as one holds such handfuls; till the regiment, which had
halted a little while at Willard's, was ordered forward and
took the turning from Pennsylvania Avenue into the road
leading to Virginia. With that, the whole regiment burst into
song; I do not know what; a deep-voiced grave melody from a
thousand throats, cheering their advance into the quarter of
the enemy and of actual warfare. I forgot Dr. Sandford then,
whose watchful eyes I generally remembered; I ceased to see
the houses or the people before me; for my eyes grew dim with
tears it was impossible to keep back; and I listened to
nothing but that mellow, ominous, sweet, bitter, strain, till
the sound faded away in the distance. Then I found that my
cheeks were wet, and that Mrs. Sandford was wondering.

"This is what it is to have an ear for music!" she said.
"There is positively no possession which does not bring some
inconvenience on the possessor. My dear Daisy, you are in
pain; those were not tears of joy; what did that chant say to
your sensibilities? To mine it only sounded strength, and
victory. If the arms of those - what are they? - that
regiment, - if their arms are only constituted proportionately
to their throats, they must do good fighting. I should think
nothing would stand before them. Daisy, they will certainly
bear down all opposition. Are you afraid? Here is the Fourth,
and Washington safe yet, for all the Southern bluster."

"I do not think you had better try to go to the Capitol," the
doctor put in.

"What, to see the meeting of Congress? Oh, yes, we will. I am
not going to miss it."

"Daisy will not?" he asked.

But Daisy would. I would try every chance. I did not at the
moment care for Congress; my wish was to find Mr. Thorold. At
the review I knew I had little reason to hope for what I
wanted; at the Capitol - after all, what chance there? when
Mr. Thorold was drilling troops from morning till night;
unless he had been already sent out of Washington. But I would
go. If I had dared, I would have expressed a desire to see
some troops drilled. I did not dare.

I remember nothing of the scene at the Capitol, except the sea
of heads, the crowd, and the heat; my intense scrutiny of the
crowd, and the weariness that grew on me. Mrs. Sandford had
friends to talk to; I only wished I need not speak to anybody.
It was a weary day; for I could not see Mr. Thorold, and I
could not hear the President's Message. I was so placed or so
surrounded that it came to me only in bits. Wearily we went
home.

At least, Dr. Sandford and I. Mrs. Sandford tried in vain to
rally us.

"There is to be a marriage in camp," she said. "What do you
think of that, Daisy? We can have invitations, we like. Shall
we like? Wouldn't it be a curious scene? Daisy is interested,
I see. Grant, no. What is the matter, Grant?"

"I hope, nothing," said the doctor.

"Will you go, if I get you an invitation?"

"Who is to be married?"

"La fille du r√©giment."

"It takes two," said the doctor.

"Oh! The other is a sergeant, I believe; some sergeant of the
same regiment. They are to be married to-morrow evening; and
it is to be by moonlight and torchlight, and everything odd;
up on that beautiful hill where we were the other day, where
the trees and the tents make such a pretty mingling with red
caps and everything else."

"I hope the ceremony will be performed by comet light, too,"
said Dr. Sandford. "It ought, to be in character."

"You do not feel well to-night, Grant?"

"Tired. So is Daisy. Are you tired of Washington, Daisy?"

"Oh - no!" I said eagerly. "Not at all. I like very much to be
here."

"Then we will go and see the sergeant's wedding," said he.

But we did not; for the next day it was found to be only too
