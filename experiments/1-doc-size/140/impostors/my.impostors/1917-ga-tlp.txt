chicken broth, which is more than they get in most 
hospitals. 

Many of the girls who had danced in her salons 
two years before, and even their younger sisters, who 
had had no chance to "come out," are helping Madame 



 

Dugas, both as nurses and in many practical ways; 
washing and doing other work of menials as cheerfully as they ever played tennis or rode in la chasse. 



II 

Curiously enough, the next woman whose work has 
made her notable, that Madame Goujon took me to see, 
was very much like Madame Dugas in appearance, certainly of the same type. 

Val de Grace is the oldest military hospital in Paris. 
It covers several acres and was begun by Louis XIII 
and finished by Napoleon. Before the war it was run 
entirely by men, but one by one or group by group 
these men, all reservists, were called out and it became a serious problem how to keep it up to its standard. Of course women were all very well as nurses, 
but it took strong men and many of them to cook 
for thousands of wounded, and there was the problem 
of keeping the immense establishment of many buildings well swept and generally clean. But the men 
had to go, reformes were not strong enough for the 
work, every bed was occupied — one entire building 
by tuberculars — and they must both eat and suffer in 
sanitary conditions. 

Once more they were obliged to have recourse to 
Woman. 

Madame Olivier, like Madame Dugas a dame du 
monde and an infirmiere major, went to one of the 
hospitals at the Front on the day war broke oat, 



 

nursed under fire, of course, but displayed so much 
original executive ability as well as willingness to do 
anything to help, no matter what, that she was soon 
put in charge of the wounded on trains. After many 
trips, during which she showed her uncommon talent 
'for soothing the wounded, making them comfortable 
even when they were packed like sardines on the floor, 
and bringing always some sort of order out of the 
chaos of those first days, she was invited to take hold 
of the problem of Val de Grace. 

She had solved it when I paid my visit with 
Madame Goujon. She not only had replaced all the 
men nurses and attendants with women but was train- 
ing others and sending them off to military hospitals 
suffering from the same sudden depletions as Val de 
Grace. She also told me that three women do the 
work of six men formerly employed, and that they 
finished before ten in the morning, whereas the men 
never finished. The hospital when she arrived had 
been in a condition such as men might tolerate but 
certainly no woman. I walked through its weary 
miles (barring the tuberculosis wards) and I never 
saw a hospital look more sanitarily span. 

But the kitchen was the show place of Val de Grace, 
little as the women hard at work suspected it. Where 
Madame Olivier found those giantesses I cannot imagine; certainly not in a day. She must have sifted 
France for them. They looked like peasant women 
and no doubt they were. Only the soil could produce 
such powerful cart-horse females. 



 

And only such cart-horses could have cooked in 
the great kitchen of Val de Grace. On a high range 
that ran the length of the room were copper pots as 
large as vats, full of stew, and these the Brobdinagians 
stirred with wooden implements that appeared to my 
shattered senses as large as spades. No doubt they 
were of inferior dimensions, but even so they were 
formidable. How those women stirred and stirred 
those steaming messes! I never shall forget it. And 
they could also move those huge pots about, those terrible females. I thought of the French Revolution. 

Madame Olivier, ruling all this force, giantesses 
included, with a rod of iron, stood there in the entrance 
of the immaculate kitchen looking dainty and out of 
place, with her thin proud profile, her clear dark skin, 
beautifully tinted in the cheeks, her seductive infirmiere 
uniform. But she has accomplished one of the minor 
miracles of the war. 

I wonder if all these remarkable women of France 
will be decorated one of these days? They have 
earned the highest citations, but perhaps they have 
merely done their duty as Frenchwomen. Cest la 
guerre.

VALENTINE THOMPSON 



FORTUNATE are those women who not only are 
able to take care of themselves but of their dependents during this long period of financial depression ; still more fortunate are those who, either wealthy 
or merely independent, are able both to stand between 
the great mass of unfortunates and starvation and to 
serve their country in old ways and new. 

More fortunate still are the few who, having made 
for themselves by their talents and energy a position 
of leadership before the war, were immediately able 
to carry their patriotic plans into effect. 

In March, 1914, Mile. Valentine Thompson, al- 
ready known as one of the most active of the younger 
feminists, and distinctly the most brilliant, established 
a weekly newspaper which she called La Vie Feminine. The little journal had a twofold purpose: to 
offer every sort of news and encouragement to the 
by-no-means-flourishing party and to give advice, 
assistance, and situations to women out of work. 

Mile. Thompson's father at the moment was in the 
Cabinet, holding the portfolio of Ministre du Commerce. Her forefathers on either side had for generations been in public life. She and her grandmother 
had both won a position with their pen and therefore 
moved not only in the best political but the best literary society of Paris. Moreover Mile. Thompson had 
a special penchant for Americans and knew more or 
less intimately all of any importance who lived in 
Paris or visited it regularly. Mrs. Tuck, the wealthiest
