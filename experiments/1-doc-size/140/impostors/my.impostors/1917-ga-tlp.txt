and that those who survive are likely to be regarded 
with a passionate admiration not unmixed with awe. 
The traditional weakness of women where men are 
concerned (which after all is but a cunning device 
of Nature) may swamp their great opportunity. They 
may fight over the surviving males like dogs over a 
bone, marry with sensations of profound gratitude (or 
patriotic fervor) the armless, the legless, the blind, 
the terrible face mutiles, and drop forever out of the 
ranks of Woman as differentiated from the ranks of 



 

mere women. What has hampered the cause of 
Woman in Great Britain and Europe so far is the 
quite remarkable valuation put upon the male by the 
female. This is partly temperamental, partly female 
preponderance, but it is even more deeply rooted in 
those vanished centuries during which man proclaimed 
and maintained his superiority. Circumstances helped 
him for thousands of years, and he has been taken 
by the physically weaker and child-bearing sex at his 
own estimate. It is difficult for American women to 
appreciate this almost servile attitude of even British 
women to mere man. One of the finest things about 
the militant woman, one by which she scored most 
heavily, was her flinging off of this tradition and displaying a shining armor of indifference toward man 
as man. This startled the men almost as much as 
the window smashing, and made other women, living 
out their little lives under the frowns and smiles of 
the dominant male, think and ponder, wonder if their 
small rewards amounted to half as much as the untasted pleasures of power and independence. 

It is always a sign of weakness to give one side of a 
picture and blithely ignore the other. Therefore, let 
me hasten to add that it is a well-known fact that 
Mrs. Pankhurst had borne and reared six children 
before she took up the moribund cause of suffrage; 
and that after a season's careful investigation in London at the height of the militant movement I concluded that never in the world had so many unattractive 
females been banded together in any one cause. Even 



 

the young girls I heard speaking on street corners, 
mounted on boxes, looked gray, dingy, sexless. Of 
course there were many handsome, even lovely, women, 
— like Mrs. Cavendish-Bentinck and Lady Hall, for 
instance — interested in "the movement," contributing 
funds, and giving it a certain moral support; but 
when it came to the window smashers, the jail seekers, the hunger-strikers, the real martyrs of that extraordinary minor chapter of Englands history, there 
was only one good-looking woman in the entire army 
— Mrs. Pethick-Lawrence — and militant extravagances 
soon became too much for her. There were intelligent women galore, women of the aristocracy born 
with a certain style, and showing their breeding even 
on the soap-box, but sexually attractive women never, 
and even the youngest seemed to have been born without the bloom of youth. The significance of this, 
however, works both ways. If men did not want 
them, at least there was something both noble and 
pitiful in their willingness to sacrifice those dreams 
and hopes which are the common heritage of the 
lovely and the plain, the old and the young, the Circe 
and the Amazon, to the ultimate freedom of those 
millions of their sisters lulled or helpless in the enchanted net of sex. 

It is doubtful if even the militants can revert to 
their former singleness of purpose; after many months, 
possibly years, of devotion to duty, serving State and 
man, the effacement of self, appreciation of the naked 
fact that the integrity of their country matters more 



 

than anything else on earth, they may be quite unable to rebound to their old fanatical attitude toward 
suffrage as the one important issue of the Twentieth 
Century. Even the very considerable number of those 
women that have reached an appearance which would 
eliminate them from the contest over such men as 
are left may be so chastened by the hideous sufferings 
they have witnessed or heard of daily, so moved by 
the astounding endurance and grim valor of man 
(who nearest approaches to godhood in time of war) 
that they will have lost the disposition to tear from 
him the few compensations the new era of peace can 
offer. If that is the case, if women at the end of 
the war are soft, completely rehabilitated in that 
femininity, or f emaleness, which was their original endowment from Nature, the whole great movement 
will subside, and the work must begin over again by 
unborn women and their accumulated grievances some 
fifty years hence. 

Nothing is more sure than that Nature will take 
advantage of the lull to make a desperate attempt to 
recover her lost ground. Progressive women, and 
before the war their ranks were recruited daily, were 
one of the most momentous results of the forces of 
the higher civilization, an evolution that in Nature's 
eye represented a lamentable divergence from type. 
Here is woman, with all her physical disabilities, become man's rival in all of the arts, save music, and in 
nearly all of the productive walks of life, as well as in 
a large percentage of the professional and executive; 



 

intellectually the equal if not the superior of the average man — who in these days, poor devil, is born a 
specialist — and making a bold bid for political equality. 

It has been a magnificent accomplishment, and it 
has marked one of the most brilliant and picturesque 
milestones in human progress. It seems incredible 
that woman, in spite of the tremendous pressure that 
Nature will put upon her, may revert weakly to type. 
The most powerful of all the forces working for Na- 
ture and against feminism will be the quite brutal and 
obscene naturalness of war, and the gross familiarity 
of civilization with it for so long a period. There 
is reversion to type with a vengeance ! The ablest of 
the male inheritors of the accumulated wisdom and 
experiences and civilizing influences of the ages were 
in power prior to August 1914, and not one of them 
nor all combined had the foresight to circumvent, or 
the diplomatic ingenuity to keep in leash the panting 
Hun. They are settling their scores, a.d. 1914-1917, 
by brute fighting. There has been some brain work 
during this war so far, but a long sight more brute 
work. As it was in the beginning, etc. 

And the women, giving every waking hour to 
arrleliorating the lot of the defenders of their hearth 
and their honor, or nursing the wounded in hospital, 
have been stark up against the physical side : whether 
making bombs in factories, bandages or uniforms, 
washing gaping wounds, preparing shattered bodies for
