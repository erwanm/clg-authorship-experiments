with us, perhaps because we had not so vigorously as- 
serted ourselves. 



VI 

A case in which a personal wrong rather than a per- 
sonal right was offensively asserted, was that of a lady, 
young and too fair to be so unfair, in a crowded train 
coming from the Doncaster Races to York. She had 
kept a whole first-class compartment to herself, putting 
her maid into the second-class adjoining, and heaping 
the vacant seats with her hand-baggage, which had also 
overflowed into the corridor. At the time the train 
started she was comforting herself in her luxurious soli- 
tude with a cup of tea, and she stood up, as if to keep 
other people out. But, after waiting, seven of us, in 
the corridor, until she should offer to admit us, we all 
swarmed in upon her, and made ourselves indignantly 
at home. When it came to that she offered no pro- 
test, but gathered up her belongings, and barricaded 
herself with them P Among the rest there was a type- 
writing-machine, but what manner of young lady she 
was, or whether of the journalistic or the theatrical 
tribe, has never revealed itself to this day. We could 
not believe that she was very high-born, not nearly so 
high, for instance, as the old lady who helped dis- 
possess her, and who, when we ventured the hope that 
it would not rain on the morrow, which was to be St. 
Leger Day, almost lost the kindness for us inspired by 
some small service, because we had the bad taste to 
suggest such a possibility for so sacred a day. 

I never saw people standing in a train, except that 

 

once which I have already noted, when in a very 
crowded car in Wales, two women, decent elderly 
persons, got in and were suffered to remain on foot by 
the young men who had comfortable places; no one 
dreamed, apparently, of offering to give up his seat. 
But, on the other hand, a superior civilization is shown 
in what I may call the manual forbearance of the trolley 
and railway folk, who are so apt to nudge and punch 
you at home here, when they wish your attention. The 
like happened to me only once in England, and that 
was at Liverpool, where the tram conductor, who laid 
hands on me instead of speaking, had perhaps been 
corrupted by the unseen American influences of a port 
at which we arrive so abundantly and indiscriminately. 
I did not resent the touch, though it is what every 
one is expected to do, if aggrieved, and every one else 
does it in England. Within his rights, every one is 
safe; though there may be some who have no rights. 
If there were, I did not see them, and I suppose that, 
as an alien, I might have refused to stand up and un- 
cover when the band began playing God Save the King, 
as it did at the end of every musical occasion ; I might 
have urged that, being no subject of the King, I did 
not feel bound to join in the general prayer. But that 
would have been churlish, and, where every one had 
been so civil to me, I did not see why I should not be 
civil to the King, in a small matter. In the aggregate 
indeed, it is not a small matter, and I suppose that 
the stranger always finds the patriotism of a country 
molestive. Patriotism is, at any rate, very disagree- 
able, with the sole exception of our own, which we are 
constantly wishing to share with other people, especial- 
ly with English people. We spare them none of it, 
even in their own country, and yet many of us ob- 
ject to theirs; I feel that I am myself being rather 


offensive about it, now, at this distance from them. 
Upon the whole, not caring very actively for us, one 
way or the other, they take it amiably ; they try to get 
our point of view, and, as if it were a thorn, self- 
sacrificially press their bosoms against it, in the pres- 
ent or recent entente cordiale. None of their idiosyn- 
crasies is more notable than their patience, their kind- 
ness with our divergence from them ; but I am not sure 
that, having borne with us when we are by, they do not 
take it out of us when we are away. 

We are the poetry of a few, who, we like to think, 
have studied the most deeply into the causes of our be- 
ing, or its excuses. But you cannot always be enjoying 
poetry, and I could well imagine that our lovers must 
sometimes prefer to shut the page. The common gen- 
tleness comes from the common indifference, and from 
something else that I will not directly touch upon. 
What is certain is that, with all manner of strangers, 
the English seem very gentle, when they meet in chance 
encounter. The average level of good manners is high. 
My experience was not the widest, and I am always 
owning it was not deep ; but, such as it was, it brought 
me to the distasteful conviction that in England I did 
not see the mannerless uncouthness which I often see 
in America, not so often from high to low, or from 
old to young, but the reverse. There may be much 
more than we infer, at the moment, from the modulated 
voices, which sweetens casual intercourse, but there are 
certain terms of respect, almost unknown to us, which 
more obviously do that effect. It is a pity that de- 
mocracy, being the fine thing it essentially is, should 
behave so rudely. Must we come to family govern- 
ment, in order to be filial or fraternal in our bearing 
with one another ? Why should we be so blunt, so 
sharp, so ironical, so brutal in our kindness ? 





VII 



The single-mindedness of the English is beautiful. 
It may not help to the instant understanding of our 
jokes; but then, even we are not always joking, and 
it does help to put us at rest and to make us feel safe. 
The Englishman may not always tell the truth, but he 
makes us feel that we are not so sincere as he; per- 
haps there are many sorts of sincerity. But there is 
something almost caressing in the kindly pause that 
precedes his perception of your meaning, and this is 
very pleasing after the sense of always having your 
hearer instantly onto you. When, by a chance in- 
definitely rarer than it is with us at home, one meets 
an Irishman in England, or better still an Irishwoman, 
there is an instant lift of the spirit; and, when one 
passes the Scotch border, there is so much lift that, on 
returning, one sinks back into the embrace of the Eng- 
lish temperament, with a sigh for the comfort of its 
soft unhurried expectation that there is really some- 
thing in what you say which will be clear by-and-by.
