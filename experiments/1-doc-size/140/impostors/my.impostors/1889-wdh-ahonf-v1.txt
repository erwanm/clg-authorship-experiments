Denver to look after some mines he had out there, 
and a railroad or two ; and now he wns at Moffitt 
again. He was supposed to be closing up his aflfairs 
there, but nobody could say. 

Fulkerson told March the morning after Dryfoos 
returned that he had not only not pulled out at 
Moffitt, but had gone in deeper, ten times deeper 
than ever. He was in a royal good-humour, Fulker- 
son reported, and was going to drop into the office 
on his way up from the street (March understood 
Wall Street) that afternoon. He was tickled to 
death with Every Other Week so far as it had gone, 
and was anxious to pay his respects to the editor. 

March accounted for some rhetoric in this, but let 
it flatter him, and prepared himself for a meeting 
about which he could see that Fulkerson was onl}'- 
less nervous than he had shown himself about the 
public reception of the first number. It gave March 
a disagreeable feeling of being Owned and of being 
about to be inspected by his proprietor ; but he fell 
back upon such independence as he could find in the 
thought of those two thousand dollars of income be- 
yond the caprice of his owner, and maintained an 
outward serenity. 



 

He was a little ashamed afterward of the resolu- 
tion it had cost him to do so. It was not a question 
of Dryfoos's physical presence : that was rather 
effective than otherwise, and carried a suggestion of 
moneyed indifference to convention in the grey 
business suit of provincial cut, and the low, wide- 
brimmed hat of flexible black felt. He had a stick 
with an old-fashioned top of buck-horn worn smooth 
and bright by the palm of his hand, which had not 
lost its character in fat, and which had a history of 
former work in its enlarged knuckles, though it was 
now as soft as March's, and must once have been 
small even for a man of IVIr. Dryfoos's stature ; he 
was below the average size. But what struck March 
was the fact that Dryfoos seemed furtively conscious 
of being a country person, and of being aware that 
in their meeting he was to be tried by other tests 
than those which would have availed him as a 
shrewd speculator. He evidently had some curiosity 
about March, as the first of his kind whom he had en- 
countered ; some such curiosity as the country school 
trustee feels and tries to hide in the presence of the 
new schoolmaster. But the whole affair was of course 
on a higher plane ; on one side Dryfoos was much 
more a man of the world than March was, and he 
probably divined this at once, and rested himself 
upon the fact in a measure. It seemed to be his 
preference that his son should introduce them, for 
he came upstairs with Conrad, and they had fairly 
made acquaintance before Fulkerson joined them. 

Conrad offered to leave them at once, but his 



 

father made him stay. "I reckon Mr. March and 
I haven't got anything so priate to talk about that 
we want to keep it from the other partners. Well, 
Mr. March, are you getting used to New York yet ? 
It takes a little time." 

" Oh yes. But not so much time as most places. 
Everybody belongs more or less in New York ; 
nobody has to belong here altogether." 

"Yes, that is so. You can try it, and go away 
if you don't like it a good deal easier than you could 
from a smaller place. "Wouldn't make so much talk, 
would it ? " He glanced at IMarch with a jocose 
light in his shrewd eyes, " That is the way I feel 
about it all the time : just visiting. Now, it 
wouldn't be that way in Boston, I reckon ? " 

" You couldn't keep on visiting there your whole 
life," said March. 

Dryfoos laughed, showing his lower teeth in a 
way that was at once simple and fierce. " Mr. 
Fulkerson didn't hardly know as he could get you 
to leave. I suppose you got used to it there. I 
never been in your city." 

"I had got used to it; but it was hardly my 
city, except by marriage. My wife 's a Bostouian." 

"She's been a little homesick here, then," said 
Dryfoos, with a smile of the same quality as his 
laugh. 

" Less than I expected," said March. " Of course 
she was very much attached to our old home." 

" I guess my wife won't ever get used to New 
York," said Dryfoos, and he drew in his lower lij) 




with a sharp sigh. "But my girls like it; they're 
young. You never been out our way yet, Mr. 
March ? Out West ? " 

"Well, only for the purpose of being born, and 
brought up. I used to live in Crawfordsville, and 
then Indianapolis." 

"Indianapolis is bound to be a great place," said 
Dryfoos. " I remember now, Mr. Fulkerson told mo 
you was from our State." He went on to brag of 
the West, as if March were an Easterner and had to 
be convinced, " You ought to sec all that country. 
It 's a great country." 

"Oh yes," said March, "I understand that." He 
expected the praise of the great West to lead up to 
some comment on Every Other JFcck ; and there was 
abundant suggestion of that topic in the manuscripts, 
proofs of letter-press and illustrations, with advance 
copies of the latest number strewn over his table. 

But Dryfoos apparently kept himself from looking 
at these things. He rolled his head about on his 
shoulders to take in the character of the room, and 
said to his son, " You didn't change the woodwork 
after all." 

'  No ; the architect thought we had better let it
