us." 

" She shan't do any such thing ! " said the 
collegian emphatically, taking Maude 's gloved 
hand upon his arm. 

" Maude, Maude, don't let him touch you ! " 
cried Gypsy vehemently, springing forward. 
" Come back with me. Oh, what are you 
doing, Maude Clare?" 

" I am going to be married," said Maude 
Clare, trying to put on her haughtiest look. 
" Mr. Sizer 's father disapproves of the match ; 
but when it is all over, he will relent, and then 
we are going home to mother 's to make it all 
right with hen (Probably this plan would 
have been accurately carried out; the young 
fellow being simply weak and sentimental, like 
herself.) Mr. Sizer comes of a very good 
family, and I know she won't object after a 
while. I should like to know what business it 
is of yours, either, Gypsy Breynton, and I 'll 
thank you to " But silly Maude 's hauteur 



broke into a sob, as Gypsy clung to her, 
pleading. 

" See here," interrupted Maude 's companion. 
" It seems to me this is my business, and I say 
she shall go. Come, Maude, it isn't safe to 
stand here. Jump in quick ! " 

Jane, comprehending matters at the first 
glance, had seen that their hope of influencing 
Maude Clare was not worth an instant 's delay, 
and had stolen swiftly back to the house for 
help. Gypsy was left alone to plead with her. 

" Come, Maude, don't disgrace and make a 
fool of yourself don t! Mr. Sizer, won't you 
just step into your chaise and take yourself 
off no, I want Maude 's hand on my arm. 
Come, Maude, come ! " 

Maude cried and hesitated, went a little way 
with her, lingered, stopped. 

"Oh, Maude!" It seemed to Gypsy as if 
Jane would never be back ; as if hours passed 
while Maude stood there sobbing. 

" Maude, Maude ! " called the voice from 
the chaise. Maude turned her head 



" Maude Maude Clare ! Maude Clare ! " 
" Oh, let me go, let me go ! " cried Maude, 
and tore herself from Gypsy 's arms to find 
herself in the stouter ones of Mrs. McMunn. 
Jane had roused the Principal, and the Prin 
cipal had roused Chaplain Goss, and the three 
stood there together. 

Mr. Sizer, his horse and chaise, disappeared 
somewhat faster than they had come, and 
Maude Clare was carried back to the Golden 
Crescent in hysterics. 





IS MAUDE CLARE SMITH 
was publicly expelled from the 
Golden Crescent. 
Her father came, a stern, indignant man, and 
took her home. " His daughter would go 
back to her mother 's nursery," he said, " and 
there she would stay till she gave evidence of 
having outgrown her childhood." 

Unhappy Maude packed her trunks, and 
bade the girls good-by, and clung to Gypsy 
sobbing. " Her heart was broken, she was 
Mire her heart was broken, and she should 



never see a happy hour again, never! They 
had taken her away from Ben poor fellow ! 
she knew his heart would break too, and she 
should find in the papers some morning that he 
had drowned himself, or hung himself with a 
horrid rope O-o-o-oh ! and now they were 
taking her away from Gypsy, the only friend 
she had who ever cared anything about her, 
and Gypsy didn't have half the sympathy with 
her that she expected; and oh, to think of 
never seeing Ben again ! The Shadow of her 
Lifetime was darkening down, and there was 
nobody left to understand or appreciate. She 
wished she were dead, she did ! dead and 
buried up in a coffin, with her weary heart at 
rest ! She thought she shouldn't live very 
long, either; and if Gypsy heard of her in 
consumption, she needn't be surprised." 

Gypsy kissed her and cried a little, and when 
the carriage had fairly rolled away with her, 
went away alone upstairs, and cried a little 
more. But she was surprised to find that she 
did not feel as badly as she had expected to, 



and that when Jane came in and kissed away 
her tears she was quite ready to be comforted. 

The fact was, that Gypsy 's respect for Maude 
Clare, which Maude herself had been slowly 
undermining bit by bit the last few months, was 
now gone " at one fell swoop," and love with 
out respect is like a house without foundation. 
She felt sorry for Maude with a compassionate, 
superior sense of pity. Beautiful Queen Marie 
had lost her Fidelio ; the sweet allegiance was 
broken ; the pretty dream was gone. So she 
wiped her eyes, hoped Maude would not have 
consumption, and learned her Virgil lesson as 
if nothing had happened. 

i will state, for the benefit of the compas 
sionate, that Maude Clare did not have con 
sumption, and I am really afraid that she has 
not had even the consistency to break her 
heart. For I read last week in the newspapers
