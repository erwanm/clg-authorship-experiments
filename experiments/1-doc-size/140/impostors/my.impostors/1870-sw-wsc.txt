be uncompromising about," her oldest sister 
remarked. 

What is that? " the little one asked quick. 

" Girls, stop talking and go to bed," said 
their mother. " Letitia and Anne, put up work ; 
I am tired. Maria, you and Tilly go at once 
and be out of the way." 

"I can't see how I am in the way," remarked Maria. " Letty has not done her 
bonnet yet, and she will not go iill she has." 
. " Letty, I am not going to wait for that 
bonnet." 

" No, ma'am there is no need." 

" I am not going to leave you up, either. I
know how that works. The bonnet can be 
finished to-morrow. And Anne, roll up your 
ruffles. Come, girls ! " 

" What a lovely mantilla that is going to be; 
isn't it, mamma ? " said Maria. " Won't Anne 
look nice when she gets it on ? I wish you'd 
let me have one just like it, mamma. ' 

" I do not care about your having one just 

like it," said Anne. " What would be the use 
of that ? " 

" The same use, I suppose " 

" Maria, go to bed ! " said her mother 
" And Matilda. Look what o'clock it is." 

" I can't go, mamma, unless somebody will 
bring me some shoes. Mine are wet." 

" Maria, fetch Tilly a pair of shoes. And go, 
children." 

The children went ; but Maria grumbled. 

" Why couldn't you come upstairs in your 
stocking feet? I should." 

" It isn't nice," said the little one. 

" Nice ! you're so terribly nice you can't do 
anything other people do. There is no use in 
our coming to bed now; Anne and Letty 
will sit up till eleven o'clock, I shouldn't 
wonder; and we might just as well as not. 
Mamma can't get them to bed. Letty and 
Anne ought to have been at the meeting to- 
night. I wonder if they would have risen. 
Why did not you rise, Matilda ? " 

I had not thought about it." 




" Can't you do anything without thinking 
about it first?" 

" I do not understand it yet." 

" Understand ! why, nothing is easier than 
to understand. Of course, we are all to be 
as good as we can be that's all." 

" You don't think that is much," said the 
little one, as she began slowly to undress herself. The work of undressing and dressing 
was always slow with Tilly. Every article of 
clothing taken off was to be delicately folded 
and nicely laid away at night ; and taken out 
and put on with equal care and punctiliousness in the morning. Maria's stockings went 
one way and her shoes another; while Tilly's 
were put exactly ready for use under her 
chair. And Maria's clothes presently lay in 
a heap on the floor. But not till some time 
after Matilda's neat arrangements had been 
made and she herself was safe in bed. Maria 
had dallied while the other was undressing. 

"I think you are very curious, Matilda!" 
she exclaimed as she followed her sister into 


bed. " I shouldn't think it required much 
thinking-, to know that one ought to be good." 

" You haven't put out the candle, Maria." 

Maria bounced from her bed, and bounced 
in again. 

" O Maria!" said Matilda in a moment or 
two, plaintively, " you've blown it out ! and the 
room is all filled with smoke." 

" It doesn't make any difference," said 
Maria. 

" It is very disagreeable." 

" It will be gone in a minute." 

" No, it wont, for I can see the red spark on 
the end of the candle now." 

" You are so particular, Tilly ! " said her 
sister. " If you ever take a notion to be good, 
you'll have to leave off some of your ways, 
I can tell you. You needn't mind a little 
smell of candle-smoke. Go to sleep, and forget it." 

" Don't good people mind disagreeable 
things?" said Matilda. 

" No, of course they don't. How could they 



 

get along, you know. Don't you remember 
what Mr. Richmond said ? " 

" I don't remember that he said that. But 
then, Maria, would you mind getting up to
