He laughed and kissed her. Jaqueline went to her room and wrote a
very properly worded letter to Marian. Maum Chloe had two new pudding
recipes that were delicious. She had the latest sleeve pattern, and
Madam Weare had been to spend the day, and wore such a lovely cap that
she was quite sure grandmamma would like it. They had concocted one out
of some old mull, the torn breadth of a gown, and Marian could take it
home. Then Elizabeth Fairfax was making some of the prettiest darned
lace, a Vandyke cape that was just coming in, and she would be here for
a few days next week. If Marian could come down, even if she could only
stay one night. The week afterward there would be an influx of company.
It would be just delightful to have her and Dolly then--perhaps they
might be able to come--but Marian had better come and stay over. They
would not want to be poking over lace-making and all that when there
was lots of fun going on.

Shrewd as Grandmother Floyd was she fell into the trap so adroitly set
by this flighty young person.

"Madam Weare is very genteel in her tastes and is not given to foolish
things because they are new. I hardly know anyone who dresses so
suitably. I do think Louis or Jaqueline might have ridden up. And I do
not see what Patricia is about, or your uncle either, to let Jaqueline
have her head so much. She ought to be learning something useful. The
Fairfaxes are well enough, a nice family, and Elizabeth is a very
well-behaved girl--industrious, too. But I'd like to see the lace
Jaqueline will make!" with a strong touch of scorn in her voice, and a
slight lifting of the nose to make it more emphatic.

"The Vandyke capes are very pretty and graceful. Mrs. Lee brought
one from Paris, and it cost a fortune," remarked Marian. "And darned
net----"

"I think I know what it is. Of course it is the pattern and the amount
of work that makes it valuable. You might do one through the course of
the summer, Marian."

"If I knew how"--and the girl gave a little sigh.

"Let me see the letter." Marian had been reading it aloud. "I don't
know but you might go, but I don't care to have you in the rabble
of the week after. It would be a grand thing if that young Carrington
would fancy Jaqueline and she would have sense enough to accept him.
But such girls go through the woods and take a crooked stick at last."

Nothing more was said for a day or two. Marian found an old engraving
of a Vandyke collar and cuffs, only they were done in point lace. What
kind of net was used, she wondered. And then her mother decided she
would go down for the day and leave Marian for a night or two. But
grandfather had a poorly spell, and she thought it best not to leave
him. Marian rode her horse down, attended by old Cato, who had to go to
Alexandria on some business and would escort her home on the third day.

"Oh, good gracious!" cried Jaqueline; "if she had come! For the
rabble is here already, and someone you will like to see. They've
gone off fishing. Betty and Hester Fairfax and Georgie Baker are out
on the west porch. We're in for a good time. Mr. Ralston and Roger
Carrington came down with Louis, and to-night we are going to have a
little dance."

"Mother approves of Elizabeth Fairfax. And I do want to know about
the Vandyke cape and the cap pattern. Oh, Jacky!"

Marian clasped her arms about her cousin, and the obnoxious name was
forgiven. For the warm pressure was full of gratitude.

"You are so wise about things, Jaqueline. Of course mother sees all our
letters----"

"As if I didn't know that," laughed Jaqueline.

"But I wonder--oh, Jaqueline, do you suppose I will have to marry Mr.
Greaves? You see, father has set his heart upon it. And I should be so
near them, and so----"

"The idea! A man double your age, and four children! You don't even
like him. What is youth for but a time to be merry and glad and to
have good times? And it was a shame you could not come to Washington!
Lieutenant Ralston would have taken you everywhere, and Jane was up to
white heat about it. It was all splendid. You're not engaged--you can't
have been so foolish!"

"Oh, Jaqueline! I wish I had your----"

"Spunk!" Jaqueline exclaimed with a laugh, while Marian was considering.

"You see, no one really governs you. Your father is so indulgent."

"Oh, I don't have quite everything my own way, I assure you! But what
have you done in this matter?"

"Why, Mr. Greaves has explained to father and mother. Of course he will
not say anything to me until the year is up. He is very punctilious,
and I am so glad he believes in the year. He comes over and we have
a game of whist, which I hate, and get out of when there is other
company. But father expects me to stay in the room. Occasionally he
questions me about something--household affairs generally. Mrs. Greaves
was an excellent housekeeper--much superior to his sister, he thinks."


"Oh, Marian! I should die if I had to marry such a man. Come, let us
go down to the girls and forget all about him. Cassy will put away your
things."

Marian lingered.

"Well--what else?" impatiently. "You don't really want to tell me that
you have a fancy for this wretched old fellow?"

"Oh, no, no! But, Jaqueline--of course I did not know Mr. Ralston
would be here, yet I had a sort of presentiment that you had planned
something. And is it quite fair, do you think? I mean honest to--to
enjoy it all? I am afraid he likes me."

"I am quite sure he does. But I wasn't sure of his coming. Louis met
him at Jane's, and likes him immensely. There are other girls here--it
isn't at all as if you were the only guest. Don't worry, but let
matters take their course. Come and see the lace-making."

The three girls welcomed Marian warmly. Elizabeth Fairfax was nearly
her own age, Hester younger, and Georgie Jaqueline's compeer and near
neighbor. Elizabeth had a sweet Madonna face, with large, downcast eyes
and a soft, deferential voice, but the eyes did ready execution on the
hearts of the young men. She was always busy about something, and it
was a study to watch her hands, they were so shapely and beautiful.

Georgie was recounting amusing episodes, and in a few moments they
were all laughing and talking. A table near by was loaded with fruit
and cake, and a pitcher of homemade "shrub" gave them a delectable
nectar. Betty had attended the inauguration, and as Marian listened
her heart grew hot and rebellious that she should have been kept
from the pleasure. She and her sister had been trained to a sharp
obedience, kept in bonds like very children. Mr. Floyd had never
cordially approved of his son-in-law. He considered it almost a crime
to have been born north of Baltimore, and Mr. Jettson had grown up
in northern New York, and to some extent made his own fortune. Jane
had gone to Philadelphia for a year's schooling with an old friend of
Mrs. Floyd's and come home engaged. Mr. Jettson had a business proffer
in Washington, and somehow the marriage was pushed through in haste.
Mr. Floyd had an objection to new people, to business people, to the
manner in which things were being conducted at Washington, and to the
