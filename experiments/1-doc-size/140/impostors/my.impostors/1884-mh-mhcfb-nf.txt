lemon, peeled and sliced very thin.

Pour the soup on these and serve.


A Soup Maigre (without Meat).

    Twelve mealy potatoes, peeled and sliced.

    One quart of tomatoes—canned or fresh.

    One half of an onion.

    Two stalks of celery.

    One tablespoonful of minced parsley.

    Four tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up and rolled in
      flour.

    One tablespoonful of cornstarch wet and dissolved in
      cold water.

    One lump of white sugar.

    Three quarts of cold water will be needed.

Parboil the sliced potatoes fifteen minutes in enough hot water to
cover them well. Drain this off and throw it away. Put potatoes,
tomatoes, onion, celery and parsley on in three quarts of cold water,
and cook gently two hours.

Then rub them all through a colander, return the soup to the pot, drop
in the sugar, season to taste with pepper and salt, boil up once and
take off the scum before adding the floured butter, and when this is
dissolved, the cornstarch.

Stir two minutes over the fire, and your soup is ready for the table.
Very good it will prove, too, if the directions be exactly followed.

When celery is out of season, you can use instead of it, a little
essence of celery, or, what is better, celery salt.

MEATS.


ONE of the most comico-pathetico true stories I know is that of a boy,
the youngest of a large family, who, having always sat at the second
table, knew nothing experimentally of the choicer portions of chicken
or turkey. Being invited out to dinner as the guest of a playmate, he
was asked, first of all present, “what part of the turkey he preferred.”

“The carker” (carcass), “and a little of the stuff” (stuffing), “if
you please,” replied the poor little fellow, with prompt politeness.

It was his usual ration, and in his ignorance, he craved nothing
better.

The pupil in cookery who enjoys tossing up entrées, and devising
dainty rechauffés, but cannot support the thought of handling raw
chickens and big-boned joints of butcher’s meat, is hardly wiser than
he.

It is a common fallacy to believe that this branch of the culinary art
is uninteresting drudgery, fit only for the hands of the very plain
hired cook.

Another mistake, almost as prevalent, lies in supposing that she can,
of course, perform the duty properly. There is room for intelligent
skill in so simple a process as roasting a piece of meat, nor is the
task severe or repulsive. Practically, it is far more important to know
how to do this well, than to be proficient in cake, jelly, and pudding
making.


Roast Beef.

Have a steady, moderate fire in the stove-grate. Increase the heat when
the meat is thoroughly warmed.

Lay the beef, skin side uppermost, in a clean baking-pan, and dash all
over it two cups of boiling water in which a teaspoonful of salt
has been dissolved. This sears the surface slightly, and keeps in the
juices.

Shut the oven door, and do not open again for twenty minutes. Then,
with a ladle or iron spoon dip up the salted water and pour it over
the top of the meat, wetting every part again and again. Eight or ten
ladlefuls should be used in this “basting,” which should be repeated
every fifteen minutes for the next hour. Allow twelve minutes to each
pound of meat in roasting beef.

Do not swing the oven door wide while you baste, but slip your hand
(protected by an old glove or a napkin) into the space left by the
half-open door, and when you have wet the surface of the roast quickly
and well, shut it up again to heat and steam.

A little care in this respect will add much to the flavor and
tenderness of the beef.

Should one side of it, or the back, brown more rapidly than the
rest, turn the pan in the oven, and should the water dry up to a few
spoonfuls, pour in another cupful from the tea-kettle.

About twenty minutes before the time for the roasting is up, draw the
pan to the oven-door, and sift flour over the meat from a flour dredger
or a small sieve. Shut the door until the flour browns, then baste
abundantly, and dredge again.

In five minutes, or when this dredging is brown, rub the top of the
meat with a good teaspoonful of butter, dredge quickly and close the
door.

If the fire is good, in a few minutes a nice brown froth will encrust
the surface of the cooked meat. Lift the pan to the side table, take
up the beef by slipping a strong cake-turner or broad knife under it,
holding it firmly with a fork, and transfer to a heated platter.

Set in the plate-warmer, or over boiling water, while you make the
gravy.


Gravy (brown).

Set the pan in which the meat was roasted, on the range when the beef
has been removed to a dish. Scrape toward the centre the browned flour
from sides and bottom and dust in a little more from your dredger as
you stir. If the water has boiled away until the bottom of the pan is
exposed, add a little, boiling hot, directly from the teakettle and
stir until the gravy is of the consistency of rich cream.

Pepper to taste and pour into a gravy boat.

While I give these directions, I may remark that few people of nice
taste like made thickened gravy with roast beef. Many prefer,
