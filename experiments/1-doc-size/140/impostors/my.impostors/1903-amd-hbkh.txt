awake again ! I do wish I 
could have a little time like the other 
girls! They’re all going to Bell Cum- 
mings’s to play croquet, and I meant to 
ask you if I couldn’t go.” 

Laura’s voice choked over a sob. It 
was hard to stay in the house all this 
beautiful weather, to know what fun the 
girls were having, and she out of it all, 
taking care of this tiresome baby. She 
wished there were no such things as 
babies in the world. Saturday, she had 



to give up Annie Graham’s little tea- 
party; Monday afternoon, she had a 
]oretty book, that had to be returned the 
next day, and he wouldn’t let her read a 
line— here it was Wednesday, and it 
seemed to her that she had done nothing 
but take care of him for the last month. 

‘ ' If you could take him in the carriage 
— he’d he so much better for a change 
in the open air.” 

Mrs. Preston uttered this timidly. 
She was so ill and worn, and looked so 
tired, that, at any other time, her little 
daughter ’s heart would have been moved 
with pity. 

‘‘But I couldn’t go there, and I 
shouldn’t want to; they’d all call me 
nurse-maid. I don’t see why Ann can’t 
find some time to take care of the baby. 
She used to, I ’m sure. ’ ’ 


 


“My being sick has made so muck 
more work, you know/’ 

At this the baby gave a cry. Laura 
jerked him up from the cradle, and then 
he screamed. 

‘'You’re aiittle crosspatch.” 

‘‘Bring him to me,” said her mother. 

Laura felt a little ashamed then, and 
cuddled him up between her face and 
neck, and began to whisper softly to him. 
He was very sleepy, and soon shut his 
eyes. 

“I guess he will go to sleep again,” 
she said, in a gentler tone, and began 
walking up and down the room. Yet all 
the time she was thinking of the bright 
sunshine, and the smooth, velvety lawn 
where the girls were going to play cro- 
quet. 

“ Mother,” she said, presently. 


 


couldn’t we have some one come and 
take care of the baby while you are so 
poorly I There’s Jenny Briggs out of a 
place. ’ ’ 

‘‘Mrs. Sayre said Jenny was very 
careless ; that she wouldn ’t trust her with 
a baby. I think I shall be better 
soon. It is real hard for you; I’m 
sorry. ’ ’ 

Something in her mother’s voice 
touched Laura, but she was not in a 
mood to be very tender. Of course, it 
was hard to have to stay in the house all 
the time, and give up everything. 

She laid the baby back in his crib, and 
gave another longing glance out of the 
window. 

“I think you might go,” her mother 
said, presently; “it’s only four now, and 
if you could be back by a little after five. 


Jamie ouglit to take a good long nap; 
he hasn ’t slept hardly any to-day. ’ ’ 

‘ ' Oh ! I should like to so much. ’ ' 

Laura 's conscience checked her. She 
felt that she ought to stay in the house, 
in case she might be needed; hut there 
was Ann downstairs, and if the baby 
would sleep ! 

‘'Yes, you can go.’' 

Mrs. Preston felt that Laura had been 
confined a great deal lately, and the 
frowning face did not promise very 
pleasant companionship. However, it 
cleared up wonderfully now. 

‘‘Oh! thank you, mamma! Ifil be 
back real early. ' ’ 

Laura ran upstairs, and slipped on her 
white dress. Ann had begged her to 
save it nice for another Sunday, “the 
ruffles were so botherin’ to iron”; but it 


was the very ruffles that she liked. Then 
she gave her hair a brush, tied on her 
blue sash, and went down. She ought 
to go in and kiss poor, pale mamma; 
but then she might wake the baby. So 
she stole softly along, lingering a mo- 
ment on the porch. Was that sound the 
little rascal Jamie waking up again? 
No, she guessed not, and down the walk 
she ran.
