swift " — " thyself the wild west wind, oh boy 


divine!" — tell me how much you think you'd 
have had of that glorious burst of music — that 
golden rain of melody, of heavenly ecstasy — if 
the man who wrote had been a wholesale-paper 
clerk or a cable-car conductor! How much do 
you think you'd have had if when he'd torn him- 
self free to write Queen Mab — or even if he'd 
been ripe enough and written his Prometheus — 
if he'd had to take them to pubhshers! If he had 
had to take them to the critics and the literary 
world and say, " Here is my work, now set me 
free that I may help mankind! " 

— And when I wrote that I sank down and 
burst into tears. It can not be helped. It is 
very hard for me. — 

Oh, but come face this thing — you that are 
responsible! 

— " But who is responsible? " I hear a voice. 
Every single man is responsible — every single 
man who has money, who loves letters, and who 
faces these facts — you — you — are responsible! 

Perhaps you are weary of my pleading, you 
think that I perish of my own weakness. But 

come and tell me, if you can, what it is that I 
have not done? What expedient is there that I 
have not tried, what resource, what hope? Have 
I not been true enough, have I not worked 
enough? Have I been extravagant, have I been 
dissipated? Did I not make my work my best? 
Come and reason with me — I shall be dead when 
you read this, but let us talk it over calmly. Put 
yourself here in my place and tell me what you 
would do. Have I not tried the publishers, the 
critics, the editors, the poets, the clergymen, the 
professors? Have I not waited — until I am sick, 
crazy? Have I not borne indignities enough? 
Have I not gotten myself kicked enough for my 
efforts? 

— But you say: " I know nothing about The 
Captive! " Yes — so it is — then let us go back 
to Shelley. A fair test would be Queen Mab or 
The Revolt of Islam — he was my age then; but 
I will go ten years later and take Prometheus 
Bound. Would he have found any one to pub- 
lish it? Did he find any one to read it? Why, 
ten or twenty years after Shelley died. Browning 
(then a boy) records that he searched all Eng- 
land for a copy of that queer poet's works! 


Why, Shelley's poetry was a byword and a 
mockery ; and Shelley himself — first of all he was 
insane, of course, and afterward he was exile, 
atheist, adulterer, and scoundrel. They took his 
children away from him, because he was not fit 
to take care of them! 

And he would not have been welcomed with 
open arms, I think! And he wouldn't have been 
set free — consecrated soul that he was. And sen- 
sitive, nervous, fragile, hysterical boy — do you 
think he would ever have written his poems, 
that he would ever have uttered his message? 

I have to make somebody understand this 
thing, somehow. I suggest that you think what 
that would have meant to you — to you who love 
poetry. Think that you would never have read: 

Oh wild west wind, thou breath of Autumn's being! . . . 
Oh lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud, 
I fall upon the thorns of life, I bleed ! 

Think that you would never have read: 

Teach me half the gladness 
That thy brain must know ! 

That you would never have read: 

On a poet's lips I slept ! 
I repeat that I have to make somebody under- 
stand this thing. I try that plan a little more. 
Listen to me now — think what it would have 
meant if that wise friend had not died when he 
did; think that you would never have read: 

And then my heart with rapture fills. 
And dances with the daffodils ! 

Think that you would never have read : 

The light that never was on sea or land, 
The consecration and the poet's dream ! 

Think that you would never have read: 

Blank misgivings of a creature 

Moving about in world not realized ; 

High instincts before which our moral nature 
Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised ! 

That you would never have read: 

Will no one tell me what she sings ? 

Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow 
For old, unhappy, far-off things 

And battles long ago. 

I say a third time that I have to make some- 
body understand this thing. Let us try it again 
now, just once again. Let us suppose that there 
had not been any little independence or any pen- 
sion. Who can think what it would have meant 


to us? Who can think what it would mean 

never to have read 

Ring out, wild bells, 
or 

When the war-drum throbs no longer, 
or 

Crossing the bar.
