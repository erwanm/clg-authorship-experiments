the day, and he would wander out in 
the vast galleries of the palace and 
invoke the Dawn, bidding it come and 
listen to his speech. The day was 
deaf, but there was the moon, and he 
prayed her to descend and share his 
couch. Luna declined to be the 
mistres of a mortal; to seduce her 
Caligula determined to become a god. 
Nothing was easier. An emperor 
had but to open his veins, and in an 
hour he was a divinity. But the 
divinity which Caligula desired was 
not of that kind. He wished to be a 
god, not on Olympus alone, but on 
earth as well. He wished to be a 
palpable, tangible, living god ; one that 
mortals could see, which was more, 
he knew, than could be said of the 
others. The mere wish was sufficient 











 Rome fell at his feet. The patent 
of divinity was in the genuflections of 
a nation. At once he had a temple, 
priests and flamens. Inexhaustible 
Greece was sacked again. The 
statues of her gods, disembarked at 
Rome, were decapitated, and on them 
the head of Caius shone. 

Heretofore his dress had not been 
Roman, nor, for that matter, the garb 
of a man. On his wrists were bracelets; about his shoulders was a mantle 
made bright with gems; beneath it 
was a tunic, and on his feet were the 
high white slippers that women wore. 
But when the god came the costume 
changed. One day he was Apollo, 
the nimbus on his curls, the Graces at 
his side; the next he was Mercury, 
wings at his heels, the caduceu.s in 
his hand; again he was Venus. But 
it was as Jupiter Latialis, armed with 
the thunderbolt and decorated with a 




great gold benrd, th.it he appeared at 
his best. 

The role was very real to him. 
After the fashion of Olympians he 
became frankly Incestuous, seducing 
vestals, his sisters too, and gaining 
in boldness with each metamorpho- 
sis, he menaced the Capitoline Jove. 
"Prove your power," he cried to him, 
"or fear my own!" lie thundered at 
him with machine-made thunder, with 
lightning that flashed from a pan. 
"Kill me," he shouted, "or I will kill 
you!" Jove, ummoved, must have 
moved his assailant, for presently 
Caligula lowered his voice, whispered 
in the old god's ear, questioned him, 
meditated on his answer, grew per- 
plexed, violent again, and threatened 
to send him home. 

These interviews humanized him. 
He forgot the moon and mingled with 
men, inviting them to die. The invitation being invariably' accepted, he 
became a connoisseur in death, an artist in blood, a ruler to whom cruelty 
was not merely an aid to government 
but an individual pleasure, and there- 
with such a perfect lover, such a 
charming host! 

"Dear heart," he murmured to his 
mistress Pryallis, as she lay one night 
in his arms, "I think I will have you 
tortured that you may tell mc why I 
love you so," But of that the girl 
saw no need. She either knew the 
reason or invented one, for presently 
he sighed in her ear: "And to think 
that I have but a sign to make and 
that beautiful head of yours is off!" 
Musings of this description were so 
pleasurable that one evening he explained to guests whom he had star- 
tled with his laughter, that it was 
amusing to reflect how easily he could 
have all of them killed. 



 

But even to a god life is not an unmixed delight. Caligula had his little troubles. About him there had 
settled a disturbing quiet. Rome was 
hushed, the world was very still. 
There was not so much as an earth- 
quake. The reign of Augustus had 
been marked by the defeat of Varus. 
Under Tiberius a falling amphithea- 
tre had killed a multitude. Caligula 
felt that through sheer felicity his own 
reign might be forgot, A famine, a 
pest, an absolute defeat, a terrific conflagrationâ€”any prodigious calamity 
that should sweep millions away and 
stamp his own memory immutably on 
the chronicles of time, how desirable 
it were ! But there was nothing. 
The crops had never been more 
abundant; apart from the arenas and 
the prisons, the health of the empire 
was excellent; on the frontiers not so 
much as the rumor of an insurrection 



 



could be heard, and Nero was vet to 
come. 

Perplexed, Caligula reflected, and
