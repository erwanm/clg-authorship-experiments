the delicate fingers of the vestryman's wife the 
smelling-salts fell upon the cushioned seat ; she held 
her feathered fan against her face. Her husband 
did not even notice this. He sat with head bowed 
upon the rail before him, as a good man does when 
reconsecrating himself at the communion hour. 

The choir rustled uneasily in their seats. The 
soprano covered her eyes with her well-gloved hand, 
and thought of the follies and regrets (she called 
them by these names) that beset the musical 
temperament. But the tenor turned his face away, 
and thought about his wife. Down the avenue, in 
the room of the " shut-in " woman, where the tele- 


phone carried the preacher's voice, a pathetic cry 
was heard : 

" Forgive ! Forgive ! Oh, if suffering had but 
made me better ! " 

But now the preacher's manner of address had 
changed again. Always remembering that it is now 
impossible to quote his language with any accuracy, 
we may venture to say that it ran in some such way 
as this : 

The Son of God, being of the Father, performed 
his Father's business. What do ye who bear his 
name ? What holy errands are ye about ? What 
miracles of consecration have ye wrought ? What 
marvels of the soul's life have ye achieved upon the 
earth since he left it to your trust ? 

He came to the sinful and the unhappy ; the 
despised and rejected were his friends ; to the poor 
he preached the Gospel ; the sick, and overlooked, 
and cast-out, the unloved and forgotten, the un 
fashionable and unpopular, he selected. These to 
his church on earth he left in charge. These he 
cherished. For such he had lived. For them he 
had suffered. For them he died. People of Saint 
Agatha's, where are they ? What have ye done to 
his beloved? Thou ancient church, honored and 
privileged and blessed among men, where are those 
little ones whom thy Master chose ? Up and down 
these godly aisles a man might look, he said, and 
see them not. Prosperity and complacency he saw 
before him ; poverty and humility he did not see. 
In the day when habit cannot reply for duty, what 
account will ye give of your betrayed trust? Will 
ye say : " Lord, we had a mission chapel. The 
curate is responsible for the lower classes. And, 
Lord, we take up the usual collections ; Saint Agatha's 
has always been called a generous church"? 

In the startled hush that met these preposterous 
words the preacher drew himself to his full height, 
and raised his hand. He had worn the white gown 
throughout the day's services, and the garment 
folded itself about his figure majestically. In the 
name of Christ, then, he commanded them : Where 
were those whom their Lord did love? Go, seek 
them. Go, find the saddest, sickest souls in ah  the 
town. Hasten, for the time is short. Search, for 
the message is of God. Church of Christ, produce 
his people to me, for I speak no more words before 
their substitutes ! 

Thus and there, abruptly, the preacher cast his 
audience from him, and disappeared from the chaneel. 
The service broke in consternation. The 
celebrated choir was not called upon to close the 
morning's worship. The soprano and the tenor 
exchanged glances of neglected dismay. The 
prayer-book remained unopened on the sacred desk. 
The desk itself was empty. The audience was, in 
fact, authoritatively dismissed dismissed without 
a benediction, like some obscure or erring thing that 
did not deserve it. 

The people stared in one another's faces for an 
astounded moment, and then, without words, with 
hanging heads, they moved to the open air and 
melted out of the church. 

The sexton rushed up to the vestryman, pale with 
fear. 

"Sir," he whispered, "he is not in the vestry- 
room. He has taken himself away God knows 
whither. What are we to do ? " 

" Trust him," replied the church officer, with a 
face of peace, " and God who sent him. Who he 
may be, I know no more than you ; but that he is 
a man of God I know. He is about his Father's 
business. Do not meddle with it." 

" Lord forbid ! " cried the sexton. " I d sooner 
meddle with something I can understand." 




Upon the afternoon of that long-remembered 
Sunday there was seen in Saint Agatha's the 
strangest sight that those ancient walls had 
witnessed since the corner-stone was laid with a silver 
trowel in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Ghost "whom we, this people, 
worship." 

Before the chimes rang for the vesper service, 
the house was filled. Before the bronze lips of the 
bells were mute, the pews were packed. Before the 
stranger reappeared, the nave and the transept over 
flowed. The startled sexton was a leaf before the 
wind of the surging crowd. He could not even 
enforce the fire-laws, and the very aisles were 
jammed. Who carried the story? How do such 
wraiths of rumors fly ? 

Every member of that church not absent from 
town or known to be ill in his bed sought his pew 
that afternoon. Many indeed left their sick-rooms 
to be present at that long-remembered service. But 
no man or woman of these came alone. Each 
brought a chosen companion ; many, two or three ; 
some came accompanied by half a dozen worshipers : 
and upon these invited guests Saint Agatha's looked 
with an astonishment that seemed to be half shame ; 




for up those velvet aisles there moved an array of 
human faces at which the very angels and virtues 
in the painted windows seemed to turn their heads
