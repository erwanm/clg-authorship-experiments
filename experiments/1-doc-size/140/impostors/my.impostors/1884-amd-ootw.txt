The Yanduyne carriage stopped before the much- 
despised store one morning, but blithesome Bertie did not 
spring out with eager face. Instead the coachman came 
in and laid a note upon the counter. 

" I will take it up stairs," said Miss Parker. 

How often some curious presentment shivers over us 
with no apparent result, and then we walk to the fiery 
brink at other times, unheeding, until the blinding flash 
leaves us stunned as by lightning. It was so with her. 
She opened and read : — 

"Eleanor, will you come to me? I am dying." 

She dropped into the nearest chair. It was from her 
mother that Celia had inherited her pure, fine courage. 
Eleanor Marshall did not shriek nor utter a moan, but it 
seemed as if she could never breathe again. 

Daisy had seen her father now and then, but reports 
had been encouraging. He was very thin and pale, but 
the cough was not nearly so troublesome. He went into 
some society, and there had been no word of warning. 

She rose presently, wrapped herself in her cloak, and 
put on her bonnet, and found the carriage waiting for 
her. Only one thought rang through her brain — dying ! 
Was this the answer to her prayer? 

The quiet waiter opened the door and bowed her up 
stairs. A woman in the hall motioned her with a slight 
gesture, and she went toward the room, entered, and the 
other shut the door. 





The room was the perfection of luxury. Bertie had not 
overpraised it. The lace and linen of the bed, with the 
heavily wrought initial, the small table with most exquisite 
appointments, passed before her eyes like a vision and 
remained there. Pillowed up in a reclining posture, so 
frail and wasted and old that it seemed at a glance as if 
it must be his mother, but for the manly token of snowy 
beard — sat Thomas Marshall. 

She came into the room like a radiant, intense, life- 
giving presence. Her cheek was a trifle flushed by the 
cold air, the sudden warmth, and the quick ascent. But 
the royal carriage, the superb health, the fine buoyancy, 
in part spiritual, the mobile mouth, with its soft, girlish lips 
that in any other woman might have been a snare, the mag- 
nificent eyes, though they had kept many a midnight vigil 
with tears, touched and stirred the man like an electric 
shock. He stretched out his wasted hands with the pas- 
sionate hunger of starvation, and his entreating cry pierced 
the far depths of her soul. 

" Eleanor ! Eleanor ! ' 

She came to him. The warm hands revivified all the 
chilling currents of his blood, the lips kissed new life into 
the others so wan and tremulous. He held her to his 
heart — was it minutes or hours ? 

It was not as he had meant to meet her. He had a 
grand forgiveness prepared. She would sit there by his 
bedside while he went over the old times, pointed out 
where she had failed in wifely duty, wifely affection — 
where her love had shown threadbare and snapped, where 
a little forbearance, a touch of wisdom, a comprehension 
of all the virtues, in short, might have changed both lives. 
His complacency had been so fostered by mother and sis- 
ter in their adverse views ; and his personal vanity, in its 
longing to whiten itself, had so glossed over its own sins, 
that they looked quite venial. There were so many mixed 
motives, so much vague, one-sided reasoning, and with it 



 

all a positive desire to have something to forgive, to offset 
any feeling she might have in regard to his delinquencies. 

In a moment all the subterfuges were swept away. In 
one blinding, dazzling, pitiless glare, like a broad sheet of 
lightning, the man saw his own life from the time of his 
business failure until now, the years when he had neither 
provided food nor shelter, when her hands had toiled not 
only for her children, but oh, shame! for money to be 
wasted in dens of drunkenness ! 

" I was naked and I was ashamed," pleaded the first 
transgressor. And looking at his naked soul in that awful 
moment of self-inspection with all the flimsy wrappings 
swept away, Thomas Marshall hid his face in shame. 
That she could forgive so grandly. That her warm, sweet 
lips could touch his soul with their own pure tenderness! 
A whole long year of joy wrenched out of his life by his 
own blindness, madness ! 

" Eleanor, my darling ! " 

She lifted her brave face full of anguish, full of tears, 
yet shining like that of an angel. Its beauty was like her 
affluent vitality, God-given. Now and then we meet a 
woman so superbly endowed, whose organization seems to 
comprehend a dozen lives in one. 

" Speak tome!" he cried entreatingly. " Let me hear 
your voice or I shall think it some mocking dream." 

" Tom ! Husband ! " She could not trust her voice any 
further. 

" O Eleanor, what a blind, insensate fool ! what a mad- 
man I have been ! " 

"Hush," she said softly. " You must not excite your- 
self or I may be blamed." 

"You have been blamed for enough, my poor darling, 
unjustly, cruelly ; wounded for the sins of others. O 
Eleanor one must believe in a God when human love so 
suffers, so forgives ! " 

She bent and kissed the forehead that looked like snow. 





" Stand up again and let me look at you. Were you 
always so beautiful, Eleanor? Or is there something — I 
can't remember — but it is about a life well used leaving 
its impress on the face. Hold my hands again. Yours 
are so warm. You look so strong — oh, it seems almost
