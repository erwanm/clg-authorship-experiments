“ Children, come to supper,” said Mrs. Alden. 


 

Tip and Primrose had to be washed again, and 
Prim’s dress was much soiled as she had shed 
her apron. 

Oh, isn’t it all beautiful ! ” sighed Tip. Pd 
like to live here. And we have only an old tin 

wash basin, and nothing is nice and new ” 

Oh, hush! ” in a whisper. “ We have mother, 
you know, and when we get big we’ll earn lots 
of money and buy them all. We mustn’t covet 
other people’s things.” 

Supper was delightful. Then Dan came round 
with the surrey, and there were no end of regret- 
ful exclamations about the day’s being so short. 

“ And, Mrs. Alden, we’ve had just the loveliest 
time, and we’re very much obliged to you.” Mrs. 
Firth had told Marigold several times to be sure 
to say this. “ I hope we haven’t made you a great 
deal of trouble, getting dinner for so many. It 
was just a splendid dinner, and the pudding was 
’licious. And the real cake for supper. Mother 
can’t afford icing, she only makes cookies and 
gingerbread, and they don’t need it. There are 
so many of us to feed.” 

“ I’m glad you liked everything,” and Mrs. 
Alden smiled down into the flushing face. Mari- 
gold felt that she had acquitted herself finely. 
“ And you must come again.” 




So the two girls were helped in. 

I'm not going home,” announced Tip. I'm 
going to stay all night with Chan.” 

Tip ! ” exclaimed the elders in a breath of wild 
surprise. 

‘‘Yes. Mayn’t I?” catching Mr. Mann’s hand 
in an appealing grasp. 

“Oh, Tip! What would mother say?” 

“ Dan can tell her. Why, she’ll be glad to have 
me stay with Chan in a strange place.” 

“ Why, I'm not afraid,” remonstrated Chan. 

Tip stood up very straight, stretching every point 
to add dignity to his protestation. 

“ I'm going to stay. You’ll let me?” to Mr. 
Mann, who was much amused at the little fellow’s 
persistency. 

“ Tip, come this minute,” commanded Primrose. 

Instead the child took a step back, still hanging 
to his host. 

“ Oh, let him stay,” said Mr. Mann. “ Dan 
will take him home in the morning.” 

“ There ! ” triumphantly. 

“ Tip, you’ll be homesick and cry before bed- 
time,” said Chandler. 

“ No, I won’t, either.” 

“ Make believe to go,” said Marigold to Dan, 
who started Bonnie. 


 

Tip turned with superb dignity, and seated him- 
self on the step. Pilot came and gave him an 
approval. 

“ Good-by, good-by, we’re on our way, 

We’ll be glad to come another day,” 

sang out Primrose. 

Mr. Mann laughed. Chan looked rather cross, 
if so sweet a face could put on such an expression. 
The host sat down between the boys. Tip caught 
his hand again, and smiled. He placed his other 
arm around Chandler and drew him nearer. 

I don’t know what mother’ll say ” 

“ Oh, I’ll make it all right with your mother,” 
said Mr. Mann. 

“ You think because you’re bigger’n me you’re 
the biggest toad in the puddle, but you ain’t. 
Linn’s bigger’n you. And I’m goin’ to school this 
winter,” Tip said resentfully. 

“ You won’t like it a bit. You’ll have to study 
awful lessons, and you’ll get demerits.” 

Well, they don’t lick the boys any more. Linn 
said so.” 

“ Oh,” and Chan gave a sudden cry of delight. 

Hear that beautiful bird! Why, it’s ’most like 
the fine notes on the piano,” and he forgot to 
quarrel in his rapture. 

That’s a thrush — wood-robin, some people call 


 

it. They have some nests over there in the 
woods.’’ 

“ I wish I knew all the names of birds. There’s 
the blue jay and the martin and the swallow, you 
can always tell him by the beautiful way he flies, 
and the robins are as tame as anything. They 
come and eat up the chickens’ feed. And there’s 
a fire-bird that’s just gorgeous.”
