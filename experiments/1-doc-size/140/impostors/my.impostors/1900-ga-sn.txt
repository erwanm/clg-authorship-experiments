As she went up the stair, she met Miss Trumbull, 
who was coming down. 

"Your supper was very good," she said kindly. 
" Thank you for sitting up." 

That was enough for the housekeeper, who appeared 
to have conceived a worship of the hand that had 
smitten her. It had seemed to Betty in the last few 
days that she met her admiring eyes whichever way 
she turned. Miss Trumbull put out her hand and 
fumbled at the lace on Miss Madison's gown. 

" Tell me," she drawled wheedlingly, " that 's your 
beau, ain't it? I guessed he was when those flowers 
come, and the minute I set eyes on him, I said to myself, ' That 's the gentleman for Miss Madison. My ! 
but you'll make a handsome couple." 

" Oh ! " exclaimed Betty. " Oh ! " Then she 
laughed. The woman was too ridiculous for further 
anger. " Good-night," she said, and went on to her 
room. 



 



BETTY had organized a picnic for the following day, 
inviting several acquaintances from the hotel ; and they 
all drove to a favorite spot in the forest. Mrs. Madison's maid had charge of many cushions, and disposed 
her tiny mistress who looked like a wood fairy in 
lilac mull comfortably on a bed of pine needles. 
Major Carter felt young once more as he grilled steaks 
at a camp-fire, and Harriet enchanted him with her 
rapt attention while his memory rioted in deeds of 
war. 

Senator Burleigh had never appeared so well, Betty 
thought. There was an out-of-door atmosphere about 
him at any time ; no doubt he had been a mighty wind 
in the Senate more than once during the stormy passage 
of the Tariff Bill ; but with all out- doors around him he 
looked nothing less than a mountain king. His large 
well-knit frame, full of strength and energy, was at its 
triumphant best in outing tweeds and Scotch stockings ; 
his fair handsome face was boyish, despite its almost 
fierce determination, as he pranced about, intoxicated 
with the mountain air. 

" If you ever had spent one summer in Washington, 
you would understand," he said to Betty. "This is 
where I 'd like to spend the rest of my life. I 'd like 
to think I 'd never see a city or the inside of a house 
again." 

" Then you 'd probably hew down the forest, which 
would be a loss to the State : you would have to do 




something with your superfluous energy. And what 
would you do with your brain? Mere reading, when 
your arm ached from chopping, never would content 
you." 

" No, that is the worst of civilization. It either produces discontented savages like myself or goes too far 
and turns the whole body into brain. I have managed 
to get a sort of steam-engine into my head which gives 
me little rest and would wear out my body if I didn't.
happen to have the constitution of a buffalo. But I 
doubt if I shall be what North is, sixteen years hence. 
That man is the best example of equilibrium I have 
ever seen. His mental activity is enormous, but his 
control over himself is so absolute that he never wastes 
an ounce of force. I 've seen him look as fresh at the 
end of a long day of debate as he was when he got on 
his feet. He never lets go of himself for a moment." 

That was the only time Betty heard Senator North's 
name mentioned during Burleigh's visit, for the younger 
man was much more interested in himself and the 
object of his holiday. 

" I think if it hadn't.been for this Extra Session I 
should have followed you to California," he said 
abruptly. " I didn't.know how much I depended for 
my entire happiness upon my frequent visits to your 
house until I came back after the short vacation and 
found you gone." 

" It would have been jolly to have had you in California. But you must feel that your time has not been 
thrown away. Are you satisfied with the Tariff Bill?" 

" I liked it fairly well as we re-wrote it, but I don't 
expect to care much about it after it comes out of 
conference. But there are no politics in the Adiron- 



 

dacks, and when a weary Senator is looking at a woman 
in a pale green muslin " 

" You look anything but weary. I expect you will 
tramp over half the Adirondacks before you go back. 
And I am sure you will eat one of those beefsteaks. 
Come, they are ready." 

But although she managed to seat him between 
Sally Carter and an extremely pretty girl, he was at her 
side again the moment the gay party began to split 
into couples. 

" Will you come for a walk ? " he asked. " I do 
want to roam about on the old trails the Indians 
made, and to get away from these hideous emblems of 
modern civilization sailor hats. Thank heaven you 
don't wear a sailor hat." 

Betty shot a peremptory glance at Sally Carter, who 
nodded and started to follow with a small dark attache 
who had pursued herself and her million for five determined years. He was titled if not noble, a clever 
operator of a small brain, and a high-priest of teas. 
He knew the personnel of Washington Society so 
thoroughly that he never had been known to waste a 
solitary moment on a portionless girl, and he had 
successfully cultivated every art that could commend 
him to the imperious favourites of fortune. Betty 
Madison had disposed of him in short order, but 
Miss Carter, although she refused him periodically, 
allowed him to hang on, for he amused her and read 
her favorite authors. They had not walked far when 
he seized the picturesque opportunity to press his suit, 
and Miss Carter, while scolding him soundly, forgot the 
rapid walkers in front.
