" Not in your place, my darling. God will bear me 







witness, that no such thought ever entered my mind. 
I invited them to-Woodlea, from motives of the most 
simple hospitality ; and if they had not come, I should 
have shut up the house. And, though I think Edith is 
a sweeter, better, and nobler woman, than when I first 
loved her, my heart was too full of loss and sorrow, to 
take in another. Will you believe me, Dora ? " 

" Yes," she said, softly, kissing him. " And I was 
unjust, that night — but I was wild with agony." 

"lama stupid old fellow, Dora. You know I never 
could fathom mysteries, nor even guess riddles. I al- 
wa}-s had to be told the plain truth. And if you will 
say, once more, that you love me, and that nothing 
shall ever come between us — " 

She met the sweet, grave smile with one as fond, 
but the tender Solemnity of his tones, brought the tears 
to her eyes. 

" I shall never be careless or willful, again," she said, 
with slow seriousness. "These months of anguish 
have taught me what you were to me, and though they 
have been very hard, the experience has opened our 
eyes to higher, truer J03S. And you are quite sure, 
that you forgive all?" 

" All, my darling." 

And then they were content to sit in silence, until 
they were disturbed by the ringing of a bell. 

" That is for lunch," Dora announced. "Will you 
go down and have some, with mamma, or shall it be 
brought up here?" 




He smiled, wistfully. 

" Since you do not come to lunch, very often, you 
must be indulged, I suppose!"

That was so like the old, bright Dora. And yet in 
some incomprehensible way, she was changed ; not less 
sweet or winsome, but with a shy, appealing grace, a 
kind of dependence and submission, that he had never 
observed in her before. 

The servant brought up a tray, and Dora arranged 
it to her liking, on a little table. . Some toast and choco- 
late, and a few tempting French dishes. 

"Mamma has quite spoiled me," she said. "lam 
afraid you will find me fanciful and troublesome, when 
you take me back. But, Ralph, it is so delightful to 
have a mother ! " 

"Yes. I am glad you found some comfort, out of 
all the care and suffering, and one dear friend." 

" Catherine was very good to me. I think, some- 
times, I must have died, but for her tenderness. And, 
Ralph, I am quite a rich woman, only I have disposed 
of part of my fortune." 

' c And now, you jnay dispose of it all." 

She laughed. In his eyes, she would be the same, 
without a penny. 

Afterward they took Mrs. Walsingham into their 
council. The missing packet was placed in her hands, 
ftnd she read aloud, Mrs. Denver's dying confession. 
When Tremaine added to that Mrs. Cameron's incoher- 




ent admissions, the matter was shorn of its mysteries, 
and reduced to plain facts. 

"It will be best to have another marriage," Tre- 
maine announced, in his straight-forward manner. 
' Not that any one is likely to trouble us again, but 
it will set all vexed questions at rest." 

"If Jasper Cameron were not dead — " said Dora, 
with trembling lips. 

" My darling, he surely is, and can never disturb us 
again. As for what might have occurred under other 
circumstances — tfcere simply are no other circumstan- 
ces," and a rare smile finished the sentence, leaving her 
content for all time. . 

Then he tore himself away, regretfully, promising to 
bring a clergyman that evening, and also to see Mrs. 
Dawson. 

Mrs. Walsingham clasped h£r darling in her arms, 
and kissed the quivering lips. 

" It is just the ending I have fancied ; " she said, with 
subtle tenderness in her tone. " I am thankful to see the 
shadow lifted, and I know the dawn promises happiness." 

"I can never make amends for all the pain I have 
caused him," said Dora, with a little sob. "I have 
been a miserable coward, and deserve every pang that 
I have suffered. He is brave and true and manly, and 
must always be, in any emergency. Mamma, will you 
be jealous because I love him so well ? But he has been 
so good to me." 



"Dora," and there were tears in her eyes, "for a 
brief while, I had a husband whom I loved. He was no 
hero, like your Mr. Tremaine, but women's hearts are 
made of much the same material, the world over." 

From Catherine Dawson, Mr. Tremaine learned 
much more than Dora had told him, a story that sank 
deeply into his soul. Catherine softened much toward 
him, when she understood that he had suffered quite as 
keenly. 

"I had more than one misgiving, that Cameron was 
playing false to the dear bairn ; " s^e exclaimed.  ' But
