She tried not to be impulsive; that was criminal in one of her calling;
and she struggled for patience with an endeavor that was largely
successful.

As to the effect of her career outside of herself, and of those whom her
skill was to benefit, she tried to think neither arrogantly nor meanly.
She would not entertain the vanity that she was serving what is
called the cause of woman, and she would not assume any duties or
responsibilities toward it. She thought men were as good as women;
at least one man had been no worse than one woman; and it was in no
representative or exemplary character that she had chosen her course. At
the same time that she held these sane opinions, she believed that she
had put away the hopes with the pleasures that might once have taken her
as a young girl. In regard to what had changed the current of her life,
she mentally asserted her mere nullity, her absolute non-existence. The
thought of it no longer rankled, and that interest could never be hers
again. If it had not been so much like affectation, and so counter to
her strong aesthetic instinct, she might have made her dress somehow
significant of her complete abeyance in such matters; but as it was she
only studied simplicity, and as we have seen from the impression of the
barge-driver she did not finally escape distinction in dress and manner.
In fact, she could not have escaped that effect if she would; and it was
one of the indomitable contradictions of her nature that she would not.

When she came back to the croquet-ground, leading the little girl by the
hand, she found Mrs. Maynard no longer alone and no longer sad. She
was chatting and laughing with a slim young fellow, whose gay blue eyes
looked out of a sunburnt face, and whose straw hat, carried in his hand,
exposed a closely shaven head. He wore a suit of gray flannel, and Mrs.
Maynard explained that he was camping on the beach at Birkman’s Cove,
and had come over in the steamer with her when she returned from Europe.
She introduced him as Mr. Libby, and said, “Oh, Bella, you dirty little
thing!”

Mr. Libby bowed anxiously to Grace, and turned for refuge to the little
girl. “Hello, Bella!” “Hello!” said the child. “Remember me?” The child
put her left hand on that of Grace holding her right, and prettily
pressed her head against the girl’s arm in bashful silence. Grace
said some coldly civil words to the young man: without looking at Mrs.
Maynard, and passed on into the house.

“You don’t mean that’s your doctor?” he scarcely more than whispered.

“Yes, I do,” answered Mrs. Maynard. “Is n’t she too lovely? And she’s
just as good! She used to stand up at school for me, when all the girls
were down on me because I was Western. And when I came East, this
time, I just went right straight to her house. I knew she could tell
me exactly what to do. And that’s the reason I’m here. I shall always
recommend this air to anybody with lung difficulties. It’s the greatest
thing! I’m almost another person. Oh, you need n’t look after her, Mr.
Libby! There’s nothing flirtatious about Grace,” said Mrs. Maynard.

The young man recovered himself from his absentminded stare in the
direction Grace had taken, with a frank laugh. “So much the better for a
fellow, I should say!”

Grace handed the little girl over to her nurse, and went to her own
room, where she found her mother waiting to go down to tea.

“Where is Mrs. Maynard?” asked Mrs. Breen.

“Out on the croquet-ground,” answered the daughter.

“I should think it would be damp,” suggested Mrs. Green.

“She will come in when the tea-bell rings. She wouldn’t come in now, if
I told her.”

“Well,” said the elder lady, “for a person who lets her doctor pay her
board, I think ‘she’s very independent.”

“I wish you would n’t speak of that, mother,” said the girl.

“I can’t help it, Grace. It’s ridiculous,--that’s what it is; it’s
ridiculous.”

“I don’t see anything ridiculous in it. A physician need not charge
anything unless he chooses, or she; and if I choose to make Louise my
guest here it’s quite the same as if she were my guest at home.”

“I don’t like you to have such a guest,” said Mrs. Green. “I don’t see
what claim she has upon your hospitality.”

“She has a double claim upon it,” Grace answered, with a flush. “She
is in sickness and in trouble. I don’t see how she could have a better
claim. Even if she were quite well I should consider the way she
had been treated by her husband sufficient, and I should want to do
everything I could for her.”

“I should want her to behave herself,” said Mrs. Breen dryly.

“How behave herself? What do you mean?” demanded Grace, with guilty
heat.

“You know what I mean, Grace. A woman in her position ought to be more
circumspect than any other woman, if she wants people to believe that
her husband treated her badly.”

“We ought n’t to blame her for trying to forget her troubles. It’s
essential to her recovery for her to be as cheerful as she can be. I
know that she’s impulsive, and she’s free in her manners with strangers;
but I suppose that’s her Westernism. She’s almost distracted. She was
crying half the night, with her troubles, and kept Bella and me both
awake.”

“Is Bella with her now?”

“No,” Grace admitted. “Jane’s getting her ready to go down with us.
Louise is talking with a gentleman who came over on the steamer
with her; he’s camping on the beach near here. I didn’t wait to hear
particulars.”

When the nurse brought the little girl to their door, Mrs. Green took
one hand and Grace the other, and they led her down to tea. Mrs. Maynard
was already at table, and told them all about meeting Mr. Libby abroad.

Until the present time she and Grace had not seen each other since they
were at school together in Southington, where the girl used to hear so
much to the disadvantage of her native section that she would hardly
have owned to it if her accent had not found her out. It would have been
pleasanter to befriend another person, but the little Westerner suffered
a veritable persecution, and that was enough to make Grace her friend.
Shortly after she returned home from school she married, in that casual
and tentative fashion in which so many marriages seem made. Grace had
heard of her as travelling in Europe with her husband, from whom she was
now separated. She reported that he had known Mr. Libby in his bachelor
days, and that Mr. Libby had travelled with them. Mr. Maynard appeared
to have left to Mr. Libby the arrangement of his wife’s pleasures, the
supervision of her shopping, and the direction of their common journeys
and sojourns; and it seemed to have been indifferent to him whether his
friend was smoking and telling stories with him, or going with his wife
to the opera, or upon such excursions as he had no taste for. She gave
the details of the triangular intimacy with a frank unconsciousness; and
after nine o’clock she returned from a moonlight walk on the beach with
Mr. Libby.

Grace sat waiting for her at the little one’s bedside, for Bella had
been afraid to go to sleep alone.

“How good you are!” cried Louise, in a grateful under-tone, as she came
