" How do you like it, Bobby ? ' asked the book- 
seller. 

" First rate." 

" You may take that copy in your hand ; you will 
want to finish it." 

" Thank you, sir ; I will be careful of it." 

" You may keep it. Let that be the beginning of 
your own private library." 

His own private library ! Bobby had not got far 
enough to dream of such a thing yet ; but he thanked 
Mr. Bayard, and put the book under his arm. 

After tea, Ellen proposed to her father that they 
should all go to the Museum. Mr. Bayard acceded, 
and our hero was duly amazed at the drolleries per- 
petrated there. He had a good time ; but it was so 
late when he went to bed, that he was a little fearful 
lest he should oversleep himself in the morning. 

He did not,' however, and was down in the parlor 
before any of the rest of the family were stirring. An 
early breakfast was prepared for him, at which Mr. 
Bayard, who intended to see him off, joined him. 
Depositing his little bundle and the copy of " The 
Wayfarer " in the valise provided for him, they walked 



 

to the store. The porter wheeled the trunk down to 
the railroad station, though Bobby insisted upon do- 
ing it himself. 

The bookseller saw him and his baggage safely 
aboard of the cars, gave him a ticket, and then bade 
him an affectionate adieu. In a little while Bobby 
was flving over the rail, and at about eisrht o'clock, 
reached B . 

The station master kindly permitted him to deposit 
his trunk in the baggage room, and to leave it there 
for the remainder of the week. 

Taking a dozen of the books from the trunk, and 
placing them in his valise, he sallied out upon his 
mission. It must be confessed that his heart was 
filled with a tumult of emotions. The battle of life 
was before him. He was on the field, sword in hand, 
ready to plunge into the contest. It was victory or 
defeat. 

" March on, brave youth ! the field of strife 

"With peril fraught before thee lies ; 
March on ! the battle plain of life 
Shall yield thee yet a glorious prize." 

It was of no use to shrink then, even if he had felt 




disposed to do so. He was prepared to be rebuffed, 
to be insulted, to be turned away from the doors at 
which he should seek admission ; but he was deter- 
mined to conquer. 

He had reached a house at which he proposed to 
offer " The Wayfarer " for sale. His heart went pit 
pat, pit pat, and he paused before the door. 

" Now or never ! " exclaimed he, as he swung open 
the garden gate, and made his way up to the door. 

He felt some misgivings. It was so new and strange 
to him that he could hardly muster sufficient resolu- 
tion to proceed farther. But his irresolution was of 
only a moment's duration. 

"Now or never ! ' and he gave a vigorous knock 
at the door. 

It was opened by an elderly lady, whose physiogno- 
my did not promise much. 

" Good morning, ma'am. Can I sell you a copy of 
'The Wayfarer' to-day? a new book, just pub- 
lished." 

" No ; I don't want none of your books. There's 
more pedlers round the country now than you could 
shake a stick at in a month," replied the old lady, 
petulantly.

It is a very interesting book, ma'am ; has an ex- 
cellent moral." Bobby had read the preface, as I 
before remarked. " It will suit you, ma'am ; for 
you look just like a lady who wants to read some- 
thing with a moral." 

Bravo, Bobby ! The lady concluded that her face 
had a moral expression, and she was pleased with the 
idea. 

" Let me see it ; ' and she asked Bobby to walk 
in and be seated, while she went for her spectacles. 

As she was looking over the book, our hero went 
into a more elaborate recommendation of its merits. 
He was sure it would interest the young and the old ; 
it taught a good lesson ; it had elegant engravings ; 
the type was large, which would suit her eyes ; it was 
well printed and bound ; and finally, it was cheap at 
one dollar. 

" I'll take it," said the old lady. 

" Thank you, ma'am." 

Bobby's first victory was achieved. 

" Have you got a dollar ? ' asked the lady, as she 
handed him a two dollar bill.
