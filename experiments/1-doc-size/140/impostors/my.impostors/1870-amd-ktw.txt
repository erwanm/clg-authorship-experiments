him Star.” 

“ Then you shall have him,” replied Kathie. 

“ You don’t want him ? ” asked Rob, slowly. 

" It will not make any difference to me, and the 
other looks the most gentle. What shall we call 
him, Mr. Meredith ? ” 


 


“ I believe this one is named Hero.” 

“ Oh, I like that, so I shall not change it.” 

Rob could hardly forbear giving his horse a raptur- 
ous hug. Just one more week of school, and then — 
hurrah ! ” 

“ Why, Rob ! ” exclaimed his uncle, surprised at 
the pirouette. 

“ I was thinking of something” ; and Rob ran away 
quite red in the face. 

On the next morning there came a pretty low 
pony-carriage and two saddles. 

“ It will be so delightful to take Aunt Ruth out,” 
Katliie exclaimed, joyously. “ Can I learn to 
drive ? ” 

“ I am at your service for the first lesson,” said Mr. 
Meredith. “ Will you ride or drive ? ” 

“ She will need a dress for riding,” announced 
mamma, “ and it will take a few days to get that 
ready.” 

Freddy shed some tears over the fact that his was 
n’t a real live pony. 

“ You are rather small to manage one,” said Uncle 
Robert, soothingly, “ but one of these days you ’ll 
grow as large as Rob.” 


 


That was quite comforting. 

Katliie was a little timid, it must be confessed. 
The horses were very gentle creatines and well 
trained, and Mr. Meredith was the most patient of 
instructors. 

On the way they passed Lottie Thorne, who had 
gone of an errand, and so was not in school. 

“ I suppose Kathie Alston feels very grand,” she 
said, in an envious tone, as she was telling the in- 
cident. “ A handsome young gentleman too, that 
I never saw before. Girls, she will outshine us 
all ! ” 

“ Oh, it ’s her pony,” exclaimed Mary Cox. “ Bob 
told us all about it ; they each have one.” 

“ It ’s so charming to put on airs when people have 
been poor as — as — ” But Lottie hardly dared make 
the comparison in her mind.” 

“ Kathie never did put on airs, and will not now,” 
Mary declared, brave little champion that she was. 
“ I ’m sure that I ’d rather Kathie Alston would have 
a fortune than any other girl in the world.” 

Poor Lottie was forced to keep silence, but she 
made herself very miserable over the ponies. Her 
father kept two horses, but he would as soon think of 



sending Her up in a balloon as allowing her to try to 
drive. 

Eob liad his indulgence in the afternoon. He had 
ridden more than one old nag bareback, and so he 
quite plumed himself upon his skill. 

They began to plan about their party, and had 
great fun in choosing a name for the new house. 
Eob’s taste ran to the extravagant. Finally the con- 
test was narrowed to two, — Silver Lake Cottage and 
Cedarwood. At the north stood a beautiful grove of 
cedars, which made the latter very appropriate. 

Kathie proposed that they should go and call upon 
Miss Jessie and ask her opinion. Mr. Meredith was 
quite charmed with the young lady, and the sweet 
old grandmother also. 

Miss Jessie declared in favor of Cedarwood. She 
and Mr. Meredith had a gay chat and a walk through 
the garden, greatly to Kathie’s delight, for she was an 
ardent admirer of both. 

After that they were much taken up with prepara- 
tions for the party. Eob’s vacation came at last
and he could hardly contain himself. Mrs. Alston 
felt sometimes as if lie was getting quite beyond her 
jurisdiction, and he had always been rather boisterous 
and headstrong. 


 


“ We will take him in hand presently,’ said his 
uncle. “ Through the winter I shall have more time 
to devote to him, and then part of the excitement will 
have subsided. He has the foundation for a fine inan 
in him, I think.” 

" But I sometimes feel like Katliie, that we give 
you a great deal of trouble and can do but little for 
you,” she said with a sad, sweet smile. 

“ And I am glad to take the trouble. The old 
selfish, ease-loving years of my life have passed for- 
ever. In God’s good providence I have become useful 
at last.” 

The lawn and shrubbery were to be decorated with 
colored lanterns, although there would be a moon. A 
band of music was engaged, and there was to be a
