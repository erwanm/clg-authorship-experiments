Lyndell nodded. She was studying the big boy from 
top to toe. His curly, bright brown hair, his fair face 
somewhat sunburned, his merry eyes not as soft as hers 
were now, not indeed "velvet eyes" as Millicent had 
called them, but full of fire and spirit as well as fun ; a 
very respectable nose and a rather firm mouth and chin. 
Not the Beaumanoir beauty to be sure, hardly beauty at 
all at sixteen, but honest and upright and fearless. A 
fine frame, filled out rather more than one might expect 
at that age, but Randolph had never been "spindling." 
How tall he was â€” quite overtopping Bertram. 

"Well, mamma," with a rather embarrassed laugh, 
"is there something unusual about me?" 





"Except that you grow every moment. What a tall 
fellow you are ! " 

"But the Carews grow up quickly, Aunt Neale says," 
was the boy's reply. 

"And some day we shall have you bringing home 
prizes, I hope," said his mother. "I can't have my 
children distanced." 

He colored, and made as if he would speak, but did 
not. Dell remarked it. 

"You must go to bed. We must all go," exclaimed 
his father. "But, my son, I do not like to have you 
staying out so late as this." 

"We were talking of something that interested me 
very much, and I did not notice the time. But it was set- 
tled as far as it could be and won't be talked over again." 
"Is it a secret?" asked his mother, as she rose. 
" Boys have secrets as well as girls." 

Randolph came and put his hand over his father's 
shoulder, but he was looking at his mother, and an odd 
flush wavered over his face. 

"I didn't mean to say anything just yet, because it is 
so uncertain, but I think I ought not go on keeping it to 

myself, though I am afraid ' ' 

"Is it any trouble ? " asked his father, quickly, in the 
pause. 

"It's a wish, my wish, but I know it is not what you 
have planned for me. I am beginning to think I could 
not agree to that unless you insisted, and it doesn't seem 
as if any one ought to take up a profession half-heart- 
edly." 

"I shall not insist," returned his father, gravely. 
"What is your preference?" 

" I have another year at school, I know. I should 



not be old enough until then. I want to go to West 
Point afterward." 

"O Randolph!" his mother said, almost sharply. 

" That may be only a boy's fancy. Boys change their 
minds. And there are some other things. It is a gov- 
ernment appointment after you have passed your ex- 
amination." 

"Yes, that is what we were talking about to-night. 
Philip Weston's uncle will have a voice in the appoint- 
ment of the candidate next year. He wanted Phil to 
try for it, but Phil isn't a bit soldierly. And I should 
like it so ! Pve been studying up a good deal. And if 
I wasn't a soldier I should want to take up engineering. 
I want a broad, active, out-of-doors life." 

He looked fine and spirited as he said this. Then as 
no one answered at once, he continued 

" I know grandpapa will feel disappointed. He has 
destined me for papa's footsteps, and if I did not come 
up to your standard I should always feel sorry and mor- 
tified. I know I can't. It isn't in me. And it really 
wasn't in Cousin Sherburne, you see, although he thought 
he liked it at first. One ought to put one's whole soul in 
whatever one elects. And the reason I can read Homer 
so well is because the fighting and the splendid courage 
in it stirs every pulse of me. And Cicero doesn't inter- 
est me half as much." 

" There is a good deal of other fighting in the world," 
said his mother. " And a great deal of bravery needed, 
and resolve and high purpose." 

" But the kind you like appeals the most strongly to 
you," replied the boy, his eyes alight with eager pur- 
pose. 

"See how late it is," subjoined his father. "There 





will be time to have a good many talks about this in a 
year, so we needn't decide to-night." 

" But I'm glad to have you know what I am thinking 
about, and what I would rather do." 

No one answered and he bent over and kissed his 
father good-night. He had not grown too old for that. 

When he was gone Lyndell went over to her husband 
and seating herself on the broad arm of the chair 
leaned her head down on his shoulder. 

"It's something of a bombshell in our domestic tent," 
he began, with a touch of amusement, rather more indeed 
than he felt. 

"O Bertram! you will never consent. It is a boy's 
whim," she said in a tone of disapproval. 

" If it is a boy's whim it will die out. I am not so 
much surprised after all. For the last year he has not 
mentioned medicine of his own accord. I confess it has 
been a favorite dream of mine. And then his being 
named after father ' ' 

"After both of you," she amended.
