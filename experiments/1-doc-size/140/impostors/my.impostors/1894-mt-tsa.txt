was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against, 
but he done the best he could ; done it at a dis- 
advantage, too, for Tom didn't set still, as he'd 
orter done, to be fair, but always got up and 
santered around and worked his limp whilst Nat 
was painting up the adventure that he had one day 
in "Washington; for Tom never let go that limp 
after his leg got well, but practised it nights at 
home, and kept it as good as new right along. 

Nat's adventure was like this — and I will say this 
for him, that he did know how to tell it. He could 
make anybody's flesh crawl, and turn pale and hold 
his breath when he told it, and sometimes women 
and girls got so faint they couldn't stick it out. 
Well, it was this way, as near as I can remember : 

He come a-loping into Washington and put up 
his horse and shoved out to the President's house 
with his letter, and they told him the President was 
up to the Capitol and just going to start for Phila- 
delphia — not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch 
him. Nat 'most dropped, it made him so sick. 
His horse was put up, and he didn't know what to 
do. But just then along comes a nigger driving an 
old ramshackly hack, and he see his chance. He 
rushes out and shouts : 

* A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in 
a half an hour, and a quarter extra if you do it in 
twenty minutes ! ' 

' Done ! ' says the nigger. 

Nat he jumped in and slammed the door, and 
away they went, a-ripping and a-tearing over the 
roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it 
was something awful. Nat passed his arms through 
the loops and hung on for life and death, but pretty 
soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air, and 
the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat's 
feet was on the ground, and he see he was in the 
most desperate danger if he couldn't keep up with 
the hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid into 
his work for all he was worth, and hung tight 
to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly fly. He 
yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and so did 
the crowds along the street, for they could see his 
legs spinning along under the coach and his head 
and shoulders bobbing inside, through the windows, 
and knowed he was in awful danger ; but the more 
they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and 
yelled, and lashed the horses, and said, ' Don't you 
fret — I's gwyne to git you dah in time, boss ; I's 
gwyne to do it sho' ! ' for you see he thought they 
was all hurrying him up, and of course he couldn't 
hear anything for the racket he was making. And 
so they went ripping along, and everybody just 
petrified and cold to see it ; and when they got to 
the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever 
was made, and everybody said so. The horses laid 
down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and then 
they hauled him out, and he was all dust and rags, 
and barefooted ; but he was in time, and just in 
time, and caught the President and give him the 
letter, and everything was all right, and the 
President give him a free pardon on the spot, and 
Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of 
one, because he could see that if he hadn't had the 
hack he wouldn't 'a' got there in time, nor anywhere 
near it. 

It was a powerful good adventure, and Tom 
Sawyer had to work his bullet-wound mighty lively 
to hold his own and keep his end up against it. 

Well, by-and-by Tom's glory got to paling 
down gradu'ly, on accounts of other things turning 
up for the people to talk about— first a horse-race, 
and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that 
the circus, and on top of that a big auction of 
niggers, and on top of that the eclipse ; and that 
started a revival, same as it always does, and by 
that time there warn't no more talk about Tom to 
speak of, and you never see a person so sick and 
disgusted. Pretty soon he got to worrying and 
fretting right along, day in and day out, and when 
I asked him what was he in such a state about, he 
said it 'most broke his heart to think how time was 
slipping away, and him getting older and older, and 
no wars breaking out and no way of making a name 
for himself that he could see. Now, that is the wafl 
boys is always thinking, but he was the first one I 
ever heard come out and say it. 

So then he set to work to get up a plan to maki 
him celebrated, and pretty soon he struck it, and 
offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer was 
always free and generous that way. There's plenty 
of boys that's mighty good and friendly when you've 
got a good thing, but when a good thing happens to 
come their way they don't say a word to you, and try 
to hog it all. That warn't ever Tom Sawyer's style-
I can say that for him. There's plenty of boys that 
will come hankering and gruvvelling around when 
you've got an apple, and beg the core off you ; but 
when they've got one, and you beg for the core and 
remind them how you give them a core one time, 
they make a mouth at you and say thank you "most 
to death, but there ain't a-going to be no core. But 
I notice they always git come up with ; all you got 
to do is to wait. Jake Hooker always done that 
way, and it warn't two years till he got drownded. 

Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and 
Tom told us what it was. It was a crusade. 
' What's a crusade ? ' I says. 
He looked scornful, the way he's always done 
when he was ashamed of a person, and says : 

 Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don't 
know what a crusade is ? ' 

" No,' says I,  I don't. And I don't care, 
nuther. I've lived till now and done without it, and 
had my health, too. But as soon as you tell me, I'll 
know, and that's soon enough. I don't see no use 
in finding out things and clogging my head up with 
them when I mayn't ever have any occasion for 
them. There was Lance Williams, he learnt how 
to talk Choctaw, and there warn't ever a Choctaw 
here till one come and dug his grave for him. Now, 
then, what's a crusade ? But I can tell you one thing 
before you begin : if it's a patent-right, there ain't 

no money in it. Bill Thompson he ' 

' Patent-right ! ' he says. ' I never see such an 
idiot. Why, a crusade is a kind of a war.'
