perhaps that you whistle! I don’t believe the wind does either,
here. It only whispers,” he sought gracefully to explain; “and it
sighs----”

“And I hope,” she broke in, “that it sometimes laughs!”

The sound she gave only made him, as he looked at her, more
serious. “Whatever it does, it’s all right.”

“All right?”--they were sufficiently together again for her to lay
her hand straight on his arm. “Then you promise?”

“Promise what?”

He had turned as pale as if she hurt him, and she took her hand
away. “To meet Mr. Prodmore.”

“Oh, dear, no; not yet!”--he quite recovered himself. “I must
wait--I must think.”

She looked disappointed, and there was a momentary silence. “When
have you to answer him?”

“Oh, he gives me time!” Clement Yule spoke very much as he might
have said, “Oh, in two minutes!”

“I wouldn’t give you time,” Mrs. Gracedew cried with force--“I’d
give you a shaking! For God’s sake, at any rate”--and she
really tried to push him off--“go upstairs!”

“And literally find the dreadful man?” This was so little his
personal idea that, distinctly dodging her pressure, he had already
reached the safe quarter.

But it befell that at the same moment she saw Cora reappear on
the upper landing--a circumstance that promised her a still better
conclusion. “He’s coming down!”

Cora, in spite of this announcement, came down boldly enough without
him and made directly for Mrs. Gracedew, to whom her eyes had attached
themselves with an undeviating glare. Her plain purpose of treating
this lady as an isolated presence allowed their companion perfect
freedom to consider her arrival with sharp alarm. His disconcerted
stare seemed for a moment to balance; it wandered, gave a wild glance
at the open door, then searched the ascent of the staircase, in which,
apparently, it now found a coercion. “I’ll go up!” he gasped; and
he took three steps at a time.

The girl threw herself, in her flushed eagerness, straight upon the
wonderful lady. “I’ve come back to you--I want to speak to you!”
The need had been a rapid growth, but it was clearly immense. “May I
confide in you?”

Her instant overflow left Mrs. Gracedew both astonished and
amused. “You too?” she laughed. “Why it is good we come
over!”

“It is, indeed!” Cora gratefully echoed. “You were so very kind
to me and seemed to think me so curious.”

The mirth of her friend redoubled. “Well, I loved you for it, and it
was nothing moreover to what you thought me!”

Miss Prodmore found, for this, no denial--she only presented her frank
high colour. “I loved you. But I’m the worst!” she generously
added. “And I’m solitary.”

“Ah, so am I!” Mrs. Gracedew declared with gaiety, but with
emphasis. “A very queer thing always is solitary! But, since we
have that link, by all means confide.”

“Well, I was met here by tremendous news.” Cora produced it with a
purple glow. “He wants me to marry him!”

Mrs. Gracedew looked amiably receptive, but as if she failed as yet to
follow. “‘He’ wants you?”

“Papa, of course. He has settled it!”

Mrs. Gracedew was still vague. “Settled what?”

“Why, the whole question. That I must take him.”

Mrs. Gracedew seemed to frown at her own scattered wits. “But, my
dear, take whom?”

The girl looked surprised at this lapse of her powers. “Why, Captain
Yule, who just went up.”

“Oh!” said Mrs. Gracedew with a full stare. “Oh!” she repeated,
looking straight away.

“I thought you would know,” Cora gently explained.

Her friend’s eyes, with a kinder light now, came back to her. “I
didn’t know.” Mrs. Gracedew looked, in truth, as if that had been
sufficiently odd, and seemed also to wonder at two or three things
more. It all, however, broke quickly into a question. “Has Captain
Yule asked you?”

“No, but he will”--Cora was clear as a bell. “He’ll do it
to keep the house. It’s mortgaged to papa, and Captain Yule buys it
back.”

Her friend had an illumination that was rapid for the way it
spread. “By marrying you?” she quavered.

Cora, under further parental instruction, had plainly mastered the
subject. “By giving me his name and his position. They’re awfully
great, and they’re the price, don’t you see?” she modestly
mentioned. “My price. Papa’s price. Papa wants them.”

Mrs. Gracedew had caught hold; yet there were places where her grasp
was weak, and she had, strikingly, begun again to reflect. “But
his name and his position, great as they may be, are his dreadful
politics!”

Cora threw herself with energy into this advance. “You know about
his dreadful politics? He’s to change them,” she recited, “to get
me. And if he gets me----”

“He keeps the house?”--Mrs. Gracedew snatched it up.

Cora continued to show her schooling. “I go with it--he’s to have
us both. But only,” she admonishingly added, “if he changes. The
question is--will he change?”

Mrs. Gracedew appeared profoundly to entertain it. “I see. Will
he change?”

Cora’s consideration of it went even further. “Has he changed?”

It went--and the effect was odd--a little too far for her companion, in
whom, just discernibly, it had touched the spring of impatience. “My
dear child, how in the world should I know?”

But Cora knew exactly how anyone would know. “He hasn’t seemed to
