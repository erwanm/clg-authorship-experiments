mother. These sweet, pure, transparent young girls' lives 
interested him so much, for he had reached a time when 
he ould detect the false, and the true had become dearer 
to him. His little Kathie had grown into this tall, fair 
being, and stood on the threshold of womanhood. Some 
time But no, it was pain to anticipate. 

Saturday was fair and auspicious, with a rather crisp 
air after the storm. They decided upon an early dinner, 
and then Uncle Robert handed her into the phaeton, and 
tucked the soft robe about her. How pretty and refined 
she looked, with a little dash of scarlet in her soft, gray 
costume, and everything so exquisitely harmonious ! 

The road to Middleville had met with few changes or 
improvements, and looked rather cheerless, with its well- 
nigh leafless trees and yellow or brown stubble fields ; 
yet Kathie enjoyed the drive, thinking how all the changes 
of the seasons contributed, each in its turn, a beauty and 
tone to the world ; and this was like a plain dish the day 
after a gorgeous feast. 

But as they caught sight of Farmer Strong's, they re- 
marked a change. The trees were trimmed up, the fences 
in good order, and the fields had a cleared, tidy look, as if 
the harvest was finished and put away, with no loose ends 
or fragments left about. The house had been painted a 
soft, restful stone color, with brighter trimmings, and the 
old-fashioned door-yard still abounded in bloom. There 
were chrysanthemums of almost every color, some late 
roses, and clusters of geraniums. A porch ran across part 
of the front in place of the little stoop, and at one end a 
Chinese honeysuckle was timidly clinging, while a Virginia 
creeper had made bolder essays and was hanging out its 
scarlet sprays. 

A figure flashed out of the door and down the walk. 





Yes, the two years had cKrme a great deal for Sarah Strong. 
Kathie felt that she would hardly have known her the first 
momrnt, and yet it was more the inward, spiritual change 
manifest in every direction, than any purely outward alter- 
ation. She was of medium height and rather stout, but 
there was a compactness to her figure, a firmness and vigor 
to her step, a character in the poise of her head. Her 
hair had deepened in its color, though it was still red, but 
its tint and abundance rendered it really beautiful. Her 
clear, serious, gray eyes, her gracious expression and ten- 
der smile, made the face good looking in the truest sense. 

"Oh !" she exclaimed, then paused suddenly, as if half 
abashed. 

Kathie sprang out and clasped her arms about her old- 
time friend and admirer. 

"How good of you to come!" Sarah cried, with a 
long, struggling breath. " And oh, how how beautiful 
you have grown ! I must say it ; has nt she ? " turning to 
Mr. Conover. " I have thought so much about you, and 
wondered, and your letters were such treasures. But 
there is nothing like really having you. once again ; changed 
and yet not changed ; but I don't believe anything could 
spoil you." 

" I don't know," returned Kathie, archly. " Praioe 
might." 

" No, it wouldn't: you would know that the truth was 
true, and the rest you wouldn't care for; an I sometimes 
people cannot help speaking out what is in their hearts, 
sure that it will not be wrongly interpreted. But they are 
all so anxious to see you, and yet they are afraid that you 
are a great lady." 

Sarah laughed softly, with a mellow kind of cadence, 
and Kathie joined her, as the two walked across the porch 
and entered the parlor. 

Kathie recalled unconsciously her first introduction to it. 
That too had been gradually toned down. And what 





pleased Kathie the most was the utter absence of any 
sense of newness, though she realized that it was Sarah's 
parlor, for it had nearly all been refurnished. The carpet 
was a rich deep brown, with here and there a dash of 
crimson and olive green. A few easy-chairs and the sofa 
she had once been so proud of acquiring, a pretty home- 
made bookcase, with some jars and ornaments on the top, 
and getting to be quite well filled ; the melodeon, some 
well-chosen pictures, and soft, drapery curtains in ecru, 
that toned the white wall, which Mrs. Strong would retain 
as a point of cleanliness. A cheerful fire was burning in 
an open-front stove, and the air felt delightful after the 
ride. 

"No, I am not a great lady that any one might be 
afraid of," said Kathie, with some amusement. " I feel 
very natural in getting back to the old places ; sometimes 
it seems as if another Kathie had been abroad, until I 
count up the changes." 

' Mother ! " Sarah said ; " Cousin Ellen ! " 

Mrs. Strong entered, her own hearty self in spite of a 
certain diffidence ; and her delight was visible in every line 
of her face. Beside Cousin Ellen, Martha, a tall, bashful 
girl, seemed longing to hide herself, and jet a certain curi- 
osity conquered her shyness ; but in a few moments the 
group seemed increased indefinitely, with almost every 
child pushing forward, until Kathie stood in the midst, a 
little princess with her loyal retainers. 

Uncle Robert had driven down to the barn, as usual. To 
the thrift here had been added a kind of sensible orderli- 
ness. The farmers around rather sneered at the new-fan- 
gled notions of the Strongs, taken out of books and papers, 
but the result remained a source of astonishment, and not a 
little secret envy. There were better crops finer fruit, 
some successful ventures in new things ; and the money 
gain was the thing they could not well despise. Father 
and sous labored harmoniously together. James had his 




workshop and exercised his ingenuity on rainy days pro- 
ducing some creditable pieces of workmanship. He had 
decided not to go to the cityfor a trade, and add another 
to the stragglers. 

Within the house they talked and talked. Kathie in her
