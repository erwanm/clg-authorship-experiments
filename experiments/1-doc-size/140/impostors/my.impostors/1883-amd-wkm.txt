but a story about some one else. But her mother's grief; 
ah, yes, that made it all real. 





Her tears dropped silently 

' ' O Uncle Robert ! " she said, with a great, pitiful sob, 
" can she never come to sense and memory again? May 
be she might have learned to love and to care. And the 
little baby, Rob's baby ? " 

He knew then it would have one friend ; but he almost 
grudged the tender tears for the other, knowing well the 
worst part, that would have shocked them with horror, and 
perhaps entirely rehabilitated Rob, had been withheld. 
"Was it right and just? For an instant he felt quite un- 
certain. 

There followed a quiet interval at Cedarwood. Kathie 
spent her time in trying to comfort her mother. She was 
glad in those days that Fay Collamore had gone to Lake 
George with Mr. and Mrs. Hunsdon. Emma was her only 
friend, and they two drew nearer in a tender spiritual 
communion. 

Once Kathie had spoken of having the baby, but her 
mother had answered with a sharp, sudden pain. Charlie 
came home full of joy and hope, but he tempered it sweetly 
to the sorrow he found. Every day or two they heard 
from Aunt Ruth. Robert had come, and they were so glad 
to have him. Bruce lived, but it was a doubtful question. 
They all hoped, they could not give him up. 

The whisper floated about that Robert Alston had made 
a secret, unfortunate marriage, and that his wife through 
an accident had lost her mind. 

Dick Grayson knew more about her, though he made no 
comment to any one save Mr. Conover. 

" They were a bad lot," he said ; u I don't see how Rob 
could have been fooled by them ; but the girl was very 
pretty. And, somehow, I 'm not sure but I would rather 
have her in an asylum, out of harm's way, than to do as 
her sister has done. But poor Rob ! We must all try to 
make it up to him." 



CHAPTER XX. 

THE very brooding over her sorrow worked a partial 
cure in Mrs. Alston's case. She saw the suffering, the 
shame, the fear, the brave resolve to eat the bitter fruit he 
had gathered, to make no outcry at the sting, since he had 
grasped -the nettles of his own will and pleasure. She 
longed for a first word from him, and yet she admired the 
strength that could wait and accept the sentence. 

Yet he was hers, and nothing could weaken that bond. 
She could recall so many little remorseful touches of the 
summer before ; once when he had stood with his arms 
clasped about her neck, and said, to some little word of 
hers, " I wish I were more worthy of your love, but the 
duty of my coming years must be to make myself so." 
And the little thoughtful courtesies that had never been 
much in his way before, how they touched her now. 

So she wrote a brief note, blotted by tears, and he an- 
swered. They knew it had come, but its contents were 
sacred to her. Then he wrote to Uncle Robert : 

" During one of the long night-watches, when the Gen- 
eral was quite used up, I told Aunt Ruth my story, all that 
we decided had better be known. Uncle Robert, I think I 
must have behaved brutally to you during that last visit ! 
I was almost crazy with loneliness and despair, and fight- 
ing for the thing I wanted. I see some of it now. Aunt 
Ruth has been so sweet, so lovely, and, though I can 't 
accept it all now as you would like me to, I have come to 
my senses a little. I can never make amends for your 
love and patience, and I have broken poor mother's heart. 





O Uncle Robert, why don't we have a little sense, a little 
sure faith in the inexorable laws of right and wrong ? We 
cannot overstep them and go scot free. Every wrong way 
has its penalty. 

" Comfort my mother. I shall not ask you to forgive 
me until I have in some sense earned it by my endeavors 
in the future : as if I ever could earn it or repay you for 
what you have done." 

Bruce was better. The wound in the lung was under 
control, but the hip was not doing as well as they wished. 
There was a great deal of anxiety lest it should settle to 
permanent lameness, but they were all coming home. 
Jessie Meredith and Kathie had orders to find a cosy fur- 
nished house for winter quarters. Aunt Ruth was anxious 
that Dr. Markham should have her boy under his care. 
And again she said : I hardly know what we would have 
done without Robert. I think him truly brave and noble. 
He lacks only the ' one thing,' and I am not sure but the 
discipline of living out of this sorrow will lead him to it." 

Fred returned to college and the family went to the city 
for a visit. Hunting a house was a new and perplexing, 
as well as absorbing interest. There were enough of them, 
as Jessie said, but some were all up stairs and down, others 
all style and show. Mrs. Gamier came to the relief at 
last, with a pretty home, whose owner, a young widow, was 
going to Cuba for the winter. The lower floor had a cosy 
reception and dining room, with a spacious kitchen, and 
up stairs a lovely parlor, taking in the whole front, with 
two alcoves, and two sleeping-rooms beside, and apart- 
ments farther up in abundance. 

" This will do admirably," Jessie decided. " Brace can 
have the range of this floor, and there will be very little 
going up and down for Aunt Ruth. Then the furniture 
and adornments are neat and harmonious, which is a great 
thing for an invalid, and is just far enough from the ave- 
nue to afford quiet." 

 

Mrs. Alston had brought Jane- Maybin with her, and 
engaged a nice tidy country woman for housekeeper. 

They had just completed all arrangements when the tel- 
egram came. The party would reach New York the fol- 
lowing morning.
