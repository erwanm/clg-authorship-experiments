about his master's age, and nearly as goodly to 
look at. And there were four young women, of 
a quite extraordinary sort. They were beautiful, 
all of them — nearly as beautiful as Miss Gladys ; 
and perhaps it was only the automobile costumes, 
but they struck one as even more alarmingly 
complex. 

They were airy, ethereal creatures, with deli- 
cate peachblow complexions, and very small 
hands and feet. They seemed to favor all kinds 
of fluffy and flimsy things ; they were explosions 
of all the colors of the springtime. There were 
leaves and flowers and fruits and birds in their 
hats ; and there were elaborate filmy veils to hold 
the hats on. They descended from the motor, and 
Samuel had glimpses of ribbons and ruffles, of 
shapely ankles and daintily shppered feet. They 
came in the midst of a breeze of merriment, with 
laughter and bantering and little cries of all sorts. 





" You don't seem very glad to see us, Bertie I " 
one said. 

" Cheer up, old chap — nobody'll tell on us ! " 
cried one of the young men. 

" And we'll be good and go home early! " 
added another of the girls. 

One of the party Samuel noticed particularly, 
because she looked more serious, and hung back 
a little. She was smaller than the others, a 
study in pink and white ; her dress and hat were 
trinamed with pink ribbons, and she had the most 
marvelously pink cheeks and lips, and the most 
exquisite features Samuel had ever seen in his 
life. 

Now suddenly she ran to yoimg Lockman and 
flung her arms about his neck. 

"Bertie," she exclaimed, "it's my fault. I 
made them come! I wanted to see you so badly I 
You aren't mad with us, are you? " 

" No," said Bertie, " I'm not mad." 

"Well, then, be glad!" cried the girl, and 
kissed him again. " Be a good boy — do! " 

"All right," said Bertie feebly. "I'll be 
good. Belle." 

" We wanted to surprise you," added one of 
the yoimg fellows. 

"You surprised me all right," said Bertie — 
a reply which all of them seemed to find highly 
amusing, for they laughed uproariously. 





" He doesn't ask us in," said one of the 
girls. " Come on, Dolly — let's see this house of 
his." 

And so the party poured in. Samuel waited 
just long enough to catch the rustle of innumer- 
able garments, and a medley of perfumes which 
might have been blown from all the gardens of 
the East. Then he turned and fled to the regions 
below. 

One of the young men, he learned from the 
talk in the servants' hall, was Jack Holliday, the 
youngest son of the railroad magnate; it was his 
sister who was engaged to marry the Enghsh 
duke. The other boy was the heir of a great lum- 
ber king from the West, and though he was only 
twenty he had got himself involved in a divorce 
scandal with some actor people. Who the young 
ladies were no one seemed to know, but there were 
half -whispered remarks about them, the signifi- 
cance of which was qxiite lost upon Samuel. 

Presently the word came that the party was 
to stay to dinner. And then instantly the whole 
household sprang into activity. Above stairs 
everything would move with the smoothness of 
clockwork; but downstairs in the servants' quar- 
ters it was a serious matter that an elaborate ban- 
quet for seven people had to be got ready in a 
couple of hours. Even Samuel was pressed into 
service at odd jobs — something for which he was 





very glad, as it gave him a chance to remain in 
the midst of events. 

So it happened that he savr Peters emerging 
from the wine cellar, followed by a man with a 
huge basket full of bottles. And this set Samuel 
to pondering hard, the while he scraped away at 
a bowl of potatoes. It was the one thing which 
had disconcerted him in the Ufe of this upper 
world — the obvious part that drinking played in 
it. There were always decanters of liquor upon 
the buffet in the dining room; and liquor was 
served to guests upon any and every pretext. 
And the women drank as freely as the men — 
even Miss Gladys drank, a thing which was sim- 
ply appalling to Samuel. 

Of course, these were privileged people, and 
they knew what they wanted to do. But could 
it be right for anyone to drink? As in the case of 
suicide, Samuel found his moral convictions be- 
ginning to waver. Perhaps it was that drink did 
not aifect these higher beings as it did ordinary 
people! Or perhaps what they drank was some- 
thing that cheered without inebriating! Certain 
it was that the servants got drunk; and Samuel 
had seen that they took the stuff from the de- 
canters used by the guests. 

It was something over which he labored with 
great pain of soul. But, of course, all his hesi- 
tations and sophistries were for the benefit of his
