heard of this lady, a widow, holding in her own right, 
a large fortune. Ah, here was a formidable rival in 
deed, if rival at all ! Rich, elegant, attractive what 
had she to offer in opposition to these ? 

Of late, Mr. Guy, after dressing himself with scrupu 
lous care, went out, occasionally, in the evening. The 



 

fact had already awakened a feeling of uneasiness with 
Mrs. Harte ; now, the circumstance presented an alarm 
ing aspect, for it was connected in her mind with visits 
to the rich young widow. On this very evening the 
one following the day on which Mrs. Harte discovered 
the lady's identity Mr. Guy dressed himself and went 
away. As he left the house, Mrs. Harte passed to her 
own room, where she moved about restlessly for some 
time. Then she sat down, with deep lines on her ordi 
narily smooth brow, and a tight pressure on her lips, 
that were firmly drawn against her .teeth. Her hands 
lay clenched upon her lap. 

" Never ! Never ! Never ! " The words came in 
a deep whisper, while a gleam of passion quivered over 
her face. " I will not be pushed aside by any one ! " 

" Rising, she went to a drawer, and unlocking it, 
took out a vial the same from which Mr. Guy had 
administered the morphine to his wife and held it to 
the lio-ht. It was nearlv full. The reader will remember, 
that to hide the fatal secret of an overdose, she 
had added alcohol, and so deceived the physician. But, 
now she poured from the vial a portion equal to that 
added. 

" This is my argument," she said, as she recorked 
the vial, and held it again to the light. " He must 
take care. I am no trifler." 

It was after eleven o'clock when Mr. Guy returned. 
Mrs. Harte knew the time to a second. 

On the next morning, one of the children happened 
to be sick, and the doctor was called. In the evening, 
Mrs. Harte managed it so, that, towards nine o'clock 
she was alone with Mr. Guy. 



 

" The doctor thinks Frances quite a sick child," she 
remarked. 

" Does he? " Mr. Guy aroused himself from an ab 
stracted state of mind. 

" Yes." 

" Nothing serious, I hope." 

" There is a great deal of scarlet fever about ; and 
she complains of sore throat." 

Mr. Guy looked into Mrs. Harte's face steadily, v but 
did not answer. A brief silence followed ; then Mrs. 
Harte said 

" I don't fancy Dr. Blake." The eyes of Mr. Guy 
had fallen to the floor, but something unusual in the 
woman's voice caused him to look at her again. 

" Has he offended you in anything ? " 

" No ; but he has a prying, inquisitive way about him 
that I don't like." 

" Ah ? I haven't noticed it. In what direction does 
his inquisitiveness run ? " 

Mrs. Harte did not answer immediately. The ques 
tion disconcerted her, apparently. But, it was only in 
appearance. Mrs. Harte was never more really self- 
possessed in her life. 

" In what direction does his inquisitiveness run." 
Guy repeated the question. 

" In a direction by no means agreeable. At his last 
.three visits he has referred to the death of Mrs. Guy in 
a way which leads me to infer that something is on his 
mind." 

There was an instant change in Mr. Guy's face, and 
Mrs. Harte noted it well, and took courage. 



 

" What did he say ? " The voice betrayed alarm. . 

" He asked about the quantity of morphia that was 
given." 

" He knew that as well as you or I." 

" Perhaps not." Never since the fatal night when 
he stood, with Mrs. Harte, at the bed-side of his depart 
ing wife, had he felt so much in her power as at this 
moment ; never before had Mrs. Harte so meant to make 
him feel conscious of her power. She came nearer to 
him, now nearer, and with an intrusive familiarity 
that he dared not repel ; a familiarity that made him 
shudder as it approached. 

" Perhaps not." Ah, in the tone and manner of 
Mrs. Harte were something more than in these simple 
words. It was as if she had suddenly thrown her arms 
around him, and said, " You are in my power ! We 
are sharers of a fatal secret, and safety lies only in con 
cessions to my will." 

" He saw the vial," said Mr. Guy, in a voice which 
had suddenly grown husky. 

" But, it did not give the true indication. I know 
that three times the quantity indicated by the vial was 
administered." There was marked emphasis on the 
pronoun J. 

" The fact is," she added, after a pause, " I've never 
felt comfortable in my mind about this thing. My er 
ror was in having any part or lot with you in the mat 
ter at the beginning. I should have washed my hands 
clear of it the moment I understood the truth. But," 
she hesitated, and remained silent, for a brief space.
