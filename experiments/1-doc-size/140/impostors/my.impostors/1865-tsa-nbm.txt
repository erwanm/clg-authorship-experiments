that, he had no concern. If his brother's and sister's 
portions were alienated or squandered, under the guar 
dianship, it was of little concern to Adam. He was 
for himself, and for no one else. Already he stood sep 
arated from them ; and after getting his share of his 
father's property, he meant that the alienation should 
be complete. They must not become clogs or hindran 
ces to him on his way upward ! 

Such were Adam's thoughts and conclusions as he 
sat alone in his room just ten days before the limitations 
of miuorship were to be removed. There was a knock 
at his door. 



 

" Come in." 

A servant entered and handed the young man a card. 
It bore the name of JUSTIN LAROBE. 

" Show him up," said Adam. 

A few minutes were passed in wondering suspense, 
not untouched by anxiety. 

" What does he want ? " more than once found an 
almost audible utterance. 

Hastening feet were soon heard, and then as the door 
swung open again, Adam arose quickly, with a half utter 
ed exclamation on his lips, and a look of alarm on his face. 
Larobe confronted him with a pale, agitated counten 
ance. 

" Oh, Adam ! " exclaimed the lawyer, speaking in a 
tone of anguish. " Such a dreadful thing has happen 
ed ! " 

" What ? " asked the young man, with a look of ter 
ror. 

" Your father." 

" What of him, Mr. Larote ? " 

" Is dead ! " 

" Dead ? Dead ! " 

Mr. Larobe's hand shook as he drew a letter from his 
pocket and handed it to Adam. It was from Doctor 
Du Pontz, briefly conveying information that Mr. Guy 
had escaped from his room in the night and fallen from 
a window. In the morning he was found, lying on his 
face, which was cut and bruised by the fall, dead and 
stiff life having been extinct for some hours. 


" My poor father ! " sobbed Adam, hiding his face 
with his hands, as some waves of natural emotion 



 

swept over his heart. A short space of time the 
lawyer stood silent, until the first outburst of feeling 
had subsided. Then he said, 

" I have not yet seen your mother ; and dread being 
the medium of such horrible news. How shall I break 
to her this appalling intelligence ? Will you go with 
me?" 

But Adam shook his head. 

" Then I must see her alone," said Mr. Larobe, with 
visibly regained composure of mind. " The body must 
of course be -brought home. I will make such arrange- 

 

ments here as the case requires, and then go on in the 
evening train and reach Woodville to-morrow. In the 
mean time, go to your mother, and give her all the con 
solation in your power. Let this sad event obliterate 
all unkindness. I will write a few lines to Edwin and 
Lydia. 

The paleness and agitation had already departed from 
the lawyers face. He was composed and business-like 
in his manner. 

Adam was too much stunned by the intelligence of 
his father's death to offer any reply, and Mr. Larobe, 
having discharged his duty in making the announce 
ment, hurried away to the step-mother's residence, 
whither Adam followed in the course of an hour. Mrs. 
Guy was overwhelmed by the dreadful intelligence, 
Adam found her bathed in tears, and overflowing with 
griefs most eloquent language. She blamed herself for 
bavins; ever consented to the removal of her husband tc 



an Asylum. 

" I could have guarded him with sleepless watchfulness," 
she said, " and so prevented this terrible calamity." 

But, the son was not deceived. In acting a part, 
Mrs. Guy, like most actors, gave the lie to nature. 
Adam looked on in silence, contempt, and suspicion. 

After a brief interview with his step-mother, who 
soon regained her usual calm exterior, Adam retired 
from the house and went to the office of his lawyer in 
order to state the fact of his father's death. Sorrow 
made no part of the concern that now weighed upon 
his mind. 

" Is there a will ? " was the lawyer's first inquiry. 

Adam could not answer the question. 

" All depends on that. If there is a will, legally ex 
ecuted, its provisions bind the estate ; if there is no will, 
the law of inheritance comes in to divide the property. 
We must wait and see. Your father was too careful 
and systematic a man to neglect so important a thing 
as his will." 

Anxious and impatient for the time when all suspense 
would be removed, Adam passed the next few days in a 
state of restless uncertainty. Mr. Larobe returned, in 
due course, with the body, preserved in ice ; but the 
face was so blackened and disfigured that not a feature
