tomed to it stayed on, and the house filled up as she 
grew better, but even the sight of her in a wheeled 
chair did not bring back the prosperity of other years. 
She lamented over it with a keen and full perception 
of the fact, but in a cloudy association of it with the 
joint future of JefE and Cynthia. 

One day, after Mrs. Durgin had declared that she 
did not know what they were to do, if things kept 
on as they were going, Whitwell asked his daughter, 
" Do you suppose she thinks you and JefE have made 
it up again? " 

" I don't know," said the girl, with a troubled voice, 
" and I don't know what to do about it. It don't seem 
as if I could tell her, and yet it's wrong to let her go 
on." 

" Why didn't he tell her ? " demanded her father. 
" 'Ta'n't fair his leavin' it to you. But it's like him ! " 

The sick woman's hold upon the fact weakened 
most when she was tired. When she was better, she 
knew how it was with them. Commonly it was when 
Cynthia had got her to bed for the night that she sent 
for Jeff, and wished to ask him what he was going to 
do. " You can't expect Cynthy to stay here another 
winter helpin' you, with Jackson away. You've got 
to either take her with you, or else come here your- 
self. Give up your last year in college, why don't 
you ? I  don't want you should stay, and I don't know 
who does. If I was in Cynthia's place, I'd let you 
work off your own conditions now, you've give up the 
law. She'll kill herself, tryin' to keep you along." 

Sometimes her speech became so indistinct that no 



 

one but Cynthia could make it out ; and Je£E, listening 
with a face as nearly discharged as might be of its 
laughing irony, had to turn to Cynthia for the word 
which no one else could catch, and which the stricken 
woman remained distressfully waiting for her to re- 
peat to him, with her anxious eyes upon the girl's face. 
He was dutifully patient with all his mother's whims. 
He came whenever she sent for him, and sat quiet 
under the severities with which she visited all his past 
unworthiness. "Who you been hectorin' now, I 
should like to know," she began on him one even- 
ing when he came at her summons. " Between you 
and Fox, I got no peace of my life. Where is the 
dog?" 

" Fox is all right, mother," Jeff responded. " You're 
feeling a little better to-night, a'n't you ? " 

"I don't know; I can't tell," she returned, with a 
gleam of intelligence in her eye. Then she said, " I 
don't see why I'm left to strangers all the time." 

" You don't call Cynthia a stranger, do you, moth- 
er ? " he asked, coaxingly. 

" Oh, — Cynthy ! " said Mrs. Durgin, with a glance 
as of surprise at seeing her. " No, Cynthy's all right. 
But Where's Jackson and your father ? If I've told 
them not to be out in the dew once, I've told 'em a 
hundred times. Cynthy'd better look after her house- 
keepin' if she don't want the whole place to run be- 
hind, and not a soul left in the house. What time 
o' year is it now ? " she suddenly asked, after a little 
weary pause. 

" It's the last of August, mother." 



 

" Oh," she sighed, " I thought it was the begirniin' 
of May. Didn't you come up here in May ? " 

" Yes." 

" Well, then — Or, mebbe that's one o' them tor- 
mentin' dreams ; they do pester so ! What did you 
come for ? " 

JefE was sitting on one side of her bed and Cynthia 
on the other. She was looking at the sufferer's face, 
and she did not meet the glance of amusement which 
Jeff turned upon her at being so fairly cornered. 
" Well, I don't know," he said. " I thought you 
might like to see me." 

" What' d he come for ? " — the sick woman turned 
to Cynthia. 

" You'd better tell her," said the girl, coldly, to 
Jeff. " She -won't be satisfied till you do. She'll 
keep coming back to it." 

" Well, mother," said Jeff, still with something of 
his hardy amusement, " I hadn't been acting just 
right, and I thought I'd better tell Cynthy." 

" You better let the child alone. If I ever catch 
you teasin' them children again, I'll make Jackson 
shoot Fox." 

"All right, mother," said Jeff. 

She moved herself restively in bed. " What's 
this," she demanded of her son, " that Whit' ell's 
tellin' about you and Cynthy breakin' it off?" 

" Well, there was talk of that," said Jeff, passing 
his hand over his lips to keep back the smile that was 
stealing to them. 

" Who done it ? " 




Cynthia kept her eyes on JefE, who dropped his to 
, his mother's face. " Cynthy did it ; but I guess I 
gave her good enough reason ! " 

" About that hussy in Boston ? She was full more 
to blame than what you was. I don't see what Cyn- 
thy wanted to do it for on her account." 

" I guess Cynthy was right." 

Mrs. Durgin's speech had been thickening more and
