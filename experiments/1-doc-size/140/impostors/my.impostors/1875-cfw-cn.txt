The boor gazed as the gentleman pointed out each 
beauty. " It 's mighty grand, it 's powerful fine," he 
said at last, drawing a long breath. "But arter all, 
governor, Marthy is sweeter nor her!" 

Another time the conversation ran as follows : 

"Yes, George, that is floating on the Nile, just as I 
have told you, with the palm-trees, the gorgeous flow- 
ers, the brilliant birds, the temples, and the strange 
Pyramids. You shall see the Bedouins of the desert; 
you shall ride on Arabian horses ; you shall study the 
secrets of the Old World in their very birthplace. 
Isn't that better than living forever on this cold 
coast, with only your own two hands between your- 
self and starvation ? " 

George looked down slowly at his hands, spreading 
them open on his knees for a clearer view. " Can't 
Marthy go with me, governor?" he said, wistfully. 

"I tell you, no. You must give her up. She is 



 

as ignorant as you were before I knew you, and, being 
a woman, she cannot learn, or rather unlearn." 

" Can't women-folks learn ? " said George, wonder- 
ingly. 

" No," thundered the governor ; " they are an inferior 
race ; by nature they must be either tyrants or slaves, 
tyrants to the weak, slaves to the strong. The wise 
man chains them down; the chains may be gilded, 
but none the less must they be chains." 

"Well, then, governor," replied the youth, simply, 
" I 'll just take Marthy with me as my slave. It ull 
do as long as I have her some way ; and seeing as 
we 're going to Africa, it ull be all right, won't it ? " 

" Why do you want her, George ? " said the gentle- 
man, abruptly. " She is not beautiful ; she is utterly 
ignorant." 

" I know it, governor." 

" And she does not love you." 

" I know that too," said the boy, dejectedly. " But 
the point of the thing is just here : she may not love 
me, but, governor, I love her, love her so much that 
I can't live without her." 

" Nonsense ! Boys always think so. Try it for six 
months, George, and you 'll find I am right." 

" Not for six days, governor. I jest could n't," said 
the youth, in a tone of miserable conviction. The 
tears stood in his pale eyes, and he shifted his long 
limbs uneasily. 



 

" Don't squirm," ejaculated the gentleman, sternly, 
glowering at him over Sweet-Silence. "I'm afraid 
you 're a fool, George," he continued, after a pause. 

" I 'm afraid so too, governor." 

Then John Jay took the girl into his confidence. 
" What, go away ! " she exclaimed. " George to go 
away ! And you, sir ? " 

" I am quite attached to the boy," said the gentle- 
man, ignoring her question. " Why I call him a boy 
I scarcely know ; I myself am not thirty-five, Martha." 

" And I am not seventeen, sir." 

" A woman is a woman. But never mind that now. 
What I want to know is whether you are willing he 
should go ? " 

" yes, sir ; it will be for his good. But you ? " 

" I do not know whether I shall go or not," replied 
the gentleman, gazing down into the timid, upraised 
eyes. Then he told her of the outside world, and all 
its knowledge, all its splendor; this was what he 
intended for George. The maiden listened, spell- 
bound. 

"It will be beautiful for him," she murmured. 
"Yes, he must go. I shall make him." 

" Will he do as you say, Martha ? " 

" O yes ; he always does ! " 

"But this time it will be different." 

"How different?" 

"He must leave you behind." 



 

" O, as to that, sir, / do not want to go. I shall tell 
him so." 

" But perhaps he will not go without you." 

The girl laughed merrily, showing little white teeth 
like pearls. " Poor old George ! " she said, dismissing, 
as it were, with a wave of her small brown hand the 
absent boy-lover. Her tone jarred some chord in the 
gentleman's breast; he rose, bade her good evening 
ceremoniously, and opened the door. She lingered, 
but he stood silent. At last, subdued and timid again, 
she took up her little basket and hurried away. But 
hours afterward, when John Jay went out, according 
to his custom, to smoke Sweet-Silence in the open 
evening air, a small dark object was sitting on the 
edge of the cliff. He approached; it was Martha. 

" sir," she said, " you are not going away ? Say 
you are not ! say you are not ! " 

" What if I am ? " said the gentleman, abruptly. 

" sir ! O " And the tears came.
