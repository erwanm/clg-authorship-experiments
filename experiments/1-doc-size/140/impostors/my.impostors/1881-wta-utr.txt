"Ben Bowman, the assistant, who was in the boat that brought off your
family to the steamer, has been a lake sailor, cook and fireman all his
life; and I don't know that he has five hundred dollars in the world.
He sends most of his wages to his mother, and is one of the truest and
bravest men I ever saw."

I also told him the story of Cobbington and the two firemen. I judged
that he felt very grateful for the service the Sylvania had rendered to
him and "his people," and that he was thinking up some way to reward
her officers and crew for what they had done.

"The pilot is a Louisiana man, and says he was raised near St.
Charles," I added.

"His name is Billy Bell, and I know him very well," replied Colonel
Hungerford. "You have a very distinguished and wealthy ship's company,
Captain Alick. I wished to distribute a thousand dollars, more or less,
among them; but I see that such a proposition would be taken as an
insult by some of them."

"It would be taken as it was intended, not as an insult; but it would
be respectfully declined by the captain, the mate, the two deck-hands,
and perhaps by all the others; for I am sure that no one on board would
be willing to be paid for an act of common humanity," I replied.

"A strange ship and a strange crew," added Colonel Hungerford. "Perhaps
we shall find some way to get out of it."

I had just resolved not to assist him in his task, for it was a little
humiliating to have my crew paid for what they had done, when Miss
Blanche and Miss Margie came on the hurricane deck. They were already
fast friends. The English girl began to pour out a volley of questions
about the river and the steamers we saw, and I answered them as well as
I could; but Colonel Hungerford was better acquainted with the scene,
and he took the task upon himself of informing her, leaving Miss
Blanche to ply me with other interrogatories.

I told her all about the steamer, her going south, our adventures in
Florida, and our yachting on the Mississippi, which had thus far been a
series of adventures. Then she wanted to know who and what my father
was, and I told her all I had just related to her father.

"Then you will one day be Sir Alexander Garningham, and as a genuine
republican, I shall be under the necessity of hating you, Captain
Alick," said she, mirthfully.

"Then I promise never to allow myself to be called by that title," I
replied. "I have said as much to my father; and he does not like to be
called by anything but his military title, for he says he has earned
that fighting against the enemies of his queen. But I am a democrat,
and don't believe in any titles. Are you really a Republican, Miss
Hungerford?"

"I am a republican, but I am also a Democrat."

"I see! and I am a democrat and also a Republican."

"I don't think it will be safe for us to talk politics. You may do that
with father."

"I have told you my story, Miss Hungerford; and now it is no more than
fair that you should tell me yours," I added.

"I shall be very happy to give you my whole history from my birth to
the present day," replied the fair maiden, laughing. "I was born at St.
Charles, and lived there and in New Orleans until about a year ago,
since which time we have resided most of the time in Baton Rouge."

"Then your home is not at St. Charles?"

"Oh, yes! Our home is there, but we have one at the capital of the
state also," said the mischievous girl.

"I thought you were going to your uncle's in Baton Rouge to stay until
the mansion was repaired."

"I haven't any uncle in Baton Rouge, or anywhere else," chuckled Miss
Blanche.

"Your father certainly said he should stay at his brother's in Baton
Rouge," I added, puzzled by the statement.

"That was just as we girls used to say we were 'going to grandmother's'
when we went to the seminary."

"Who is your father, Miss Hungerford?" I asked, repeating the question
the planter had put to me.

"Colonel Hungerford," she answered, na√Øvely.

"Yes, I know; but what is he?"

"The Governor of Louisiana," replied Miss Blanche, with a merry laugh.

"The governor!" I exclaimed, appalled to think I had been talking so
familiarly to the chief magistrate of the state.

"But he won't let any one call him governor when he is not attending to
his official duties, if he can help it. He likes to be a plain citizen
when he is off duty," continued the young lady. "We went down to stay a
few days at the plantation."

Miss Margie's father called her, and thought it was too damp for her to
be out after dark. We all went below, and the colonel said he must
smoke his cigar. I conducted him to the pilot-house, where Owen and
Miss Edith were spending the evening. My father was there also; and I
took the occasion to introduce our distinguished guest to him again,
with his title in full.

"So you have found me out, Captain Alick," said his excellency, with a
pleasant laugh, which did much to restore the equilibrium between us.
"That puss of mine has been telling family secrets, and you must
promise not to tell anybody what you have discovered."

"No one not on board," I replied.

"Everybody else will know the secret, so that I shall gain nothing. But
we will not quarrel about trifles."

Everybody on board was tired enough to retire early, and before ten
o'clock we had the deck and pilot-house to ourselves. The watches
continued the same as before. Washburn gave up his berth in our room to
Billy Bell, as we learned to call him, for the captain and mate never
had their watch below at the same time, and we could both occupy the
same bed at different times. The river is a mile wide, and at the
present high stage of the water, there was no difficulty in steering,
under the instructions of the pilot.

We had a sort of panorama, or diagram of the river, which I had
obtained in New Orleans, arranged on the space between the windows of
the pilot-house, so that we could tell where we were at all times. Ben
Bowman had put the chart on rollers, and it could be wound up from one
end to the other. The only things that were likely to bother us were
the bayous and cut-offs; and the pilot was at hand at any moment he
might be needed.

We passed no place of importance during the night; and at five o'clock
in the morning we were at Donaldsonville. We made fast to the levee,
and as we were in no hurry, I did not call any of the passengers. I
told Gopher and Cobbington who the planter we had rescued was, that
