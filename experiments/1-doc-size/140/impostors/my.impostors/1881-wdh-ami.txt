him, I thought the world of him, too. I d ten 
thousand times rather have hurt myself," pleaded 
Bartley. " Don 't let me go till you say that you for 
give me." 

" I 'll  see how Henry gets along," said Mrs. Bird. 
" I don 't know as I could rightly say I forgive you 
just yet." Doubtless she was dealing conscientiously 
with herself and with him. " I like to be sure of a 
thing when I say it," she added. 



 

The doctor followed him into the hall, and Bartley 
could not help turning to him for consolation. " I 
think Mrs. Bird is very unjust, Doctor. I 've done 
everything I could, and said everything to explain 
the matter ; and I 've blamed myself where I can 't 
feel that I was to blame ; and yet you see how she 
holds out against me." 

" I dare say," answered the doctor dryly, " she 'll  
feel differently, as she says, if the boy gets along." 

Bartley dropped his hat to the floor. " Get along ! 
Why why you think he 'll  get well now, don 't you, 
Doctor ? " 

" Oh, yes ; I was merely using her words. He 'll  
get well." 

" And and it wont affect his mind, will it ? I 
thought it was very strange, his not remembering 
anything about it " 

" That 's a very common phenomenon," said the 
doctor. " The patient usually forgets everything that 
occurred for some little time before the accident, in 
cases of concussion of the brain." Bartley shuddered 
at the phrase, but he could not ask anything further. 
" What I wanted to say to you," continued the doctor, 
"was that this may be a long thing, and there may 
have to be an inquiry into it. You 're lawyer enough 
to understand what that means. I should have to 
testify to what I know, and I only know what you 
told me." 

" Why, you don 't doubt" 

" No, sir ; I 've no reason to suppose you haven 't 
told me the truth, as far as it goes. If you have 
thought it advisable to keep anything back from me, 
you may wish to tell the whole story to an attor 
ney." 

" I haven 't kept anything back, Doctor Wills," 
said Bartley. "I 've told you everything every 
thing that concerned the quarrel. That drunken old 



 

scoundrel of a Morrison got us into it. He accused 
me of making love to his daughter ; and Henry was 
jealous. I never knew he cared anything for her. 
I hated to tell you this before his mother. But this 
is the whole truth, so help me God." 

" I supposed it was something of the kind," replied 
the doctor. " I 'm sorry for you. You can 't keep it 
from having an ugly look if it gets out ; and it may 
have to be made public. I advise you to go and see 
Squire Gaylord ; he 's always stood your friend." 

"I I was just going there," said Bartley ; and 
this was true. 

Through all, he had felt the need of some sort of 're 
trieval, of re-establishing himself in his own esteem 
by some signal stroke ; and he could think of but one 
thing. It was not his fault if he believed that this 
must combine self-sacrifice with safety, and the great 
est degree of humiliation with the largest sum of con 
solation. He was none the less resolved not to spare 
himself at all in offering to release Marcia from her 
engagement. The fact that he must now also see 
her father upon the legal aspect of his case certainly 
complicated the affair, and detracted from its heroic 
quality. He could not tell which to see first, for he 
naturally wished his action to look as well as possi 
ble ; and if he went first to Marcia, and she con 
demned him, he did not know in what figure he 
should approach her father. If, on the other hand, 
he went first to Squire Gaylord, the old lawyer might 
insist that the engagement was already at an end by 
Bartley 's violent act, and might well refuse to let a 
man in his position even see his daughter. He lagged 
heavy-heartedly up the middle of the street, and left 
the question to solve itself at the last moment. But 
when he reached Squire Gaylord 's gate, it seemed to 
him that it would be easier to face the father first ; 
and this would be the right way too. 



"J 

He turned aside to the little office, and opened the 
door without knocking, and as lie stood with the 
knob in his hand, trying to habituate his eyes, full of 
the snow-glare, to the dimmer light within, he heard 
a rapturous cry of " Why Bartley ! " and he felt Mar- 
cia 's arms flung around his neck. His burdened heart 
yearned upon her with a tenderness he had not 
known before ; he realized the preciousness of an 
embrace that might be the last ; but he dared not 
put down his lips to hers. She pushed back her 
head in a little wonder, and saw the haggardness 
of his face, while he discovered her father looking 
at them. How strong and pure the fire in her must 
be when her father 's presence could not abash her 
from this betrayal of her love! Bartley sickened, 
and he felt her arms slip from his neck. " Why - 
w hy what is the matter ? " 

In spite of some vaguely magnanimous intention 
to begin at the beginning, and tell the whole affair 
just .as it happened, Bartley found himself wishing 
to put the best face on it at first, and trust to chances 
to make it all appear well. He did not speak at once, 
and Marcia pressed him into a chair, and then, like 
an eager child, who will not let its friend escape till 
it hasbeen told what it wishes to know, she set her 
self on his knee, and put her hand on his shoulder. 
He looked at her father, not at her, while he spoke 
hoarsely: "I have had trouble with Henry Bird, 
Squire Gay lord, and I 've come to tell you about it."
