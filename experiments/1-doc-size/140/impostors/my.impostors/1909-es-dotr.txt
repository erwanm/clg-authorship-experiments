"Your promise!" 

Welden ran his long, thin fingers through 
his bright thick hair. 

"Your promise!" 

"But, Maud, I am not annoyed. Annoy 
ance is not the term. If anything, I am 
alarmed." 

At that the girl also left her seat. Advancing to where he stood she said in his 
face: "It is the first time then in all your 
life." 

Welden, moving uneasily, turned away. 

"Dearest, can you not trust me? Even if 
I had not read the letter, sooner or later I 
would have known." 

With the goaded action of a bull before 
the matador, Welden tossed his head. 

"No, never, unless " He stopped, 
looked at her, weighed her. "Unless matters 
had gone the other way. It was only in 
provision of the contingency that I wrote 
you and when I did, I expressly instructed 
William that you were not to read the letter 
until you heard from me again." 

"Yes, so he told me after I had read it. 
I am not sorry, nor should you be. No 
earthly thing could have brought us nearer. 
Dearest, do you not see that between us now 
it is for always?" 

"You mean that?" 



 

"Mean it ! If you wish, I will go with you 
to-night. The world will say that I am your 
mistress, but I would rather be that than 
empress to an emperor." 

"Dona Sol!" Welden, with assumed light 
ness, threw out. 

"Dona Sol, yes, if you like, and Heloise 
also, for both said it. With them, though, it 
was heroics; with me it is the truth." 

Welden took her hands in his. "Suppos 
ing I put you to the test?" 

"Give me only time to get a cloak, and 
for William to call a cab." 

"I don't mean that. I mean a greater 
test." 

"Is there any?" 

Welden nodded. "Will you marry me?" 

Maud laughed in his face. "Do you call 
that a test? Do you?" 

Welden, a bit relieved, laughed also. 

"Well, you see," he said, "heretofore it 
has rather seemed one. I give you my word 





I had no idea but that you would refuse me." 

Maud turned, surveying the room. Then, 
assured that they were quite alone, she dis 
engaged her hands, put them on his shoul 
ders and raising herself, whispered: 

"What girl would refuse a man who loved 
her enough to kill another woman for her? 
Dearest, I adore you." 

Welden drew her to him. Presently, as 
he held her in his arms, he said: "I hope 
you destroyed that agreeable information?" 

With a smile the girl freed herself. 

"Completely," she answered. 

Then taking him again by the hand she 
led him back to where they had been seated. 

There, after a moment, she added: "Dearest, tell me about it. Did Sally know before 
hand?" 

"Now, Maud," he protested, "don't be 
morbid." 

But naively this girl in whom there was 
so little naivete persisted. 



 

"Dearest, tell me this; was it because of 
the letter you killed her?" 

"I killed her for what she killed in me, 
for her assassination of my belief in you. 
That was more to me than life, and for it I 
took hers." 

Maud thought it over. But still the epi 
sode of the letter rankled. 

"What did she do when she found you 
had my note?" 

"What did she do?" Welden repeated, 
"Personally she did nothing. But the most 
curious of all physical phenomena manifested itself in her. The red phantom of the 
human conscience appeared in her face. 
She flushed with a flame that came to her 
from hell." 

Maud contemplated the picture. It 
seemed to her over coloured. With a ques 
tion she toned it.
