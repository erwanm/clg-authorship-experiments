" His name is Randall, and I believe he is the mate." 

"The lubberly rascal! And what did he do that 
for?" 

" He entrapped me on board the vessel, and now he 
is carrying me out to sea, against my will." 

" How came you in your sailor's rig?" asked Sturdy. 

Charlie explained the trick which had been practised 
upon him, which Bill Sturdy denounced in good set' 
terms, though possibly more strong than refined. 

" He's a rascal ; there ain't a doubt of that," said Bill. 
" I should like to overhaul him, and teach him better 



manners. As for you, my lad, Vm sorry for you. 
You've shipped for the v'y'ge, and there ain't any help 
for it, as I see. But you may depend upon one thing, 
old Bill Sturdy will look out for you, and will be your 
friend." 

"Thank you," said our hero, feeling more cheerful 
and hopeful. It was something to have one friend on 
board. 

"I mistrust there are some rascals aboard," mut- 
tered Bill to himself, as he went up on deck. " They'd 
better not interfere with me or that young lad ! " and ho 
extended his muscular arm with a sense of power. 



The payment of a thousand dollars to Randall had 
been a severe blow to old Peter Manson, and this con- 
sideration materially lessened the satisfaction which he 
felt in Charlie's removal. 

We re-introduce him- to our readers, engaged, as 
usual, in counting over his hoards. Preparatory to 
doing so, he carefully secured the outer door, and also 
the door of the apartment which he occupied. 

Then lifting up a plank from the floor, he raised from 
beneath a large box containing gold coins. It was very 
heavy, and it was not without difficulty that the old 
man, who was very feeble, succeeded in lifting it to a 
level with the floor. 

The box was, perhaps, four fifths Ihll. 

The old man surveyed the deficiency with a groan. 

" It might have been full," he muttered, '' if I hadn't 
been obliged to pay away such a sight of money to that 
determined man. One thousand dollars ! two hundred 
bright, sparkling coins ! How many, many weary days 
it will take before I can supply their place. It was all 
but full. It wanted only ten more coins to make five 
thousand dollars. O gold, gold, gold ! How beautiful 
you are ! To me you are food and drink and clothing 



and friends and relations. I care for nothing but 
you." 

"While Peter was indulging in this soliloquy, he was 
engaged in counting the coins in the box. 

The result of the count showed one less tlian he had 
anticipated. 

The old man turned pale. 

" Some one has robbed me," he muttered. " Or, perchance, I have counted wrong. I will go over it again." 

This he did with eager haste and a feeling of nervous 
anxiety, and, to his no small dismay,, the count resulted 
as before. 

" They have taken my money ! " exclaimed Peter, 
tearing his white hair in aifguish. '" They will make 
me a beggar, and I shall be reduced to want in my old 
age. Oh, oh ! " 

In the midst of his lamentations he suddenly discovered the missing coin, which had rolled away, without 
his observing it, to the opposite side of the room. 

. Chuckling with delight, he picked it up and replaced 
it in the box. 

His duty satisfactorily performed, the miser put on 
his cloak, and prepared for another task. This was, to 
raise Mrs. Codman's rent, and so compel her to leave 
the rooms which she rented of him. This, however, was 
unnecessary, since, deprived of Charlie's earnings, his 
mother would have . found it impossible to pay the rent 
previously demanded. 

Peter Manson resolved to call upon his tenant in 
person. He was not afraid of recognition. He felt 
that the changes which twenty years had wrought in his 
appearance, would be a sufficient protection. Indeed, 

 
this had. already been tested; for Peter had already 
called several times 'on the same errand, without at- 
tracting a glance which could he construed into recog- 
nition. 

It was the morning after Charlie had disappeared. 
He had been absent twenty-four hours, and his mother 
had lieard nothing of him. She was in a terrible state 
of apprehension and anxiety, for few boys were more 
regular than he in repairing home as soon as his daily 
duties were over. 

Mrs. Codman had sat np late into the night, hoping 
against her fears that he would return. At length, 
exhausted by her vigils, she sank upon the bed, but not 
to sleep. In the morning she rose, unrefreshed, to pre  
pare her solitary meal. But it was in vain. Sorrow 
and anxiety had taken away her appetite, and she was 
unable to eat anything. 

Soon afterwards a knock was heard at the door. She 
hastened to open it, hoping to hear some tidings of her 
lost boy. What was her disappointment to meet the 
bent form and«wrkikled face of Peter Manson, her land- 
lord. 

The old man gave her a stealthy glance. 

"Why did I not know her before?" he thought. 
'' She is not so very much changed. But I —  ha, ha !
