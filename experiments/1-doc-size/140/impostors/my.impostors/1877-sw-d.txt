her opinion. 

' You are spoiling her ! ' 

' Really I should like to have the chance.' 

' What do you mean by that ? ' 

' Just the words. I should like to spoil Di. She has 
never had much of that sort of bad influence.' 

' That sounds very weak, to me,' said Mrs. Starling. 

' To whom should a man show himself weak, if not 
toward his wife ? ' said Basil carelessly. 

' Your wife will not thank you for it.' 




' I will endeavour to retain her respect,' said Basil in 
the same way; which aggravated Mrs. Starling, beyond 
bounds. Something about him always did try her temper, 
she said to herself. 

' Diana is going to have a fever,' she spoke abruptly. 

' I am afraid of it.' 

What's brought it on ? ' 

' I came home two evenings ago and found her on the 
bed.' 

' You don't want me, you say. Who do you expect is 
going to sit up with her and take care of her ? ' 

' I will try what I can do, for the present.' 

' You can't manage that and your out-door work too.' 

' I will manage that ' said Basil significantly. 

' And let your parish work go ? Well, I always thought 
a minister was bound to attend to his people.' 

' Yes. Isn't my wife more one of my people than any- 
body else ? Will you stay and take a cup of tea, Mrs. 
Starling?' 

' No ; if you don't want me, I am going. What will you 
do if Diana gets delirious ? I think she's out of her head 
now.' 

' I'll attend to her,' said Basil composedly. 

Half suspecting a double meaning in his words, Mrs. Starling took short leave, and drove off. Not quite easy in her 
mind, if the truth be told, and glad to be out of all patience 
with the minister. Yes, if she had known how things would 
turn if she had known, perhaps, she would not have 
thrown that first letter into the fire ; which had drawn her on 
to throw the second in, and the third. Could any son-in-law, 
could Evan Knowlton at least, have been more untoward for 
her wishes than the one she had got ? More unmanageable 
he could not have been ; nor more likely to be spooney 



 

about Diana. And now what if Diana really should have 
a fever? People talk out in delirium. Well the min- 
ister would keep his own counsel ; she did not care, she 
said. But all the same, she did care ; and she would fain 
have been the only one to receive Diana's revelations, if 
she could have managed it. And by what devil's conjuration had the truth come to be revealed, when only the fire 
and she knew anything about it. Mrs. Starling chewed the 
cud of no sweet fancy on her road home. 






CHAPTER XXVII. 



DIANA did become ill. A few days of such brain work 
as she had endured that first twenty-four hours, were too 
much even for her perfect organization. She fell into a low 
fever which at times threatened to become violent, yet never did. She was delirious, often ; and Basil heard quite 
enough of her unconscious revelations to put him in full 
possession of the situation. In different portions, Diana 
went over the whole ground. He knew sometimes that she 
was walking with Evan, taking leave of him ; perhaps taking 
counsel with him, and forming plans for life ; then wondering at his silence, speculating about ways and distances, 
tracing his letters out of the post office into the wrong 
hand. And when she was upon that strain, Diana would 
break out into a cry of " O, mother, mother, mother ! " 
repeating the word with an accent of such plaintive despair 
that it tore the heart of the one who heard it. 

There was only one. As long as this state of things 
lasted, Basil gave himself up to the single task of watching 
and nursing his wife. And amid the many varieties of 
heart-suffering which people know in this world, that which 
he tasted these weeks was one of refined bitterness. He 
came to know just how things were and just how they had 
been all along. He knew what Diana's patient or reticent 
calm covered. He heard sometimes her fond meanings 



 

over another name ; sometimes her passionate outcries t 
the owner of that name to come and deliver her; sometimes, she revealed that too, even the repulsion with which 
she regarded himself. ' Oh, not this man ! ' she said one 
night, when he had been sitting by her and hoping that she 
was more quiet. ' Oh, not this man ! It was a mistake. It 
was all a mistake. People ought to take better care at 
the post office. Tell Evan I didn't know ; but I'll come to 
him now just as soon as I can.' 

Another time she burst out more violently. ' Don't kiss 
me ! ' she exclaimed. ' Don't touch me. I wont bear it. Never 
again. I belong to somebody else, don't you know ? You 
have no business to be here.' Basil was not near her, indeed she would not have recognized him if he had been ; 
he was sitting by the fire at a distance ; but he knew 
whom she was addressing in her mournful ravings ; and 
his heart and courage almost gave way. It was very 
bitter ; and many an hour of those nights the minister 
spent on his knees at the bed's foot, seeking for strength 
and wisdom, seeking to keep his heart from being 
quite broken, striving to know what to do. Should he do 
as she said, and never kiss her again ? Should he behave 
to her in the future as a mere stranger ? What was best 
for him and for her ? Basil would have done that unflinchingly, though it had led him to the stake, if he could know
