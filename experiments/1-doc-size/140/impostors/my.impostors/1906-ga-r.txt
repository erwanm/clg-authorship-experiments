made in complete silence save for the maledictions addressed to the oxen by the boy, and an occasional : " Ay yi ! ' ' '' Madre de Dios ! ' "  Sainted 
Mary, but the sun bores a hole in the head,'' 
from Doha Ignacia, whose increasing discomfort 
banished wrath and apprehension for the hour. 

Don Jose did not even look at his daughter, but 
his face was ten years older than in the morning. 
He had begun dimly to appreciate that she was 
suffering, and in a manner vastly different from 
the passionate resentment he had seen her display when the contents of a box from Mexico 
disappointed her, or she was denied a visit to 
Monterey. That his best-beloved child should 
suffer tore his own heart, but he merely cursed 
Eezanov and resolved to do his best to persuade 
the Governor to yield to his other demands, that 
California might be rid of him the sooner. 

Father Abella was walking down the long outer 
corridor of the Mission reading his breviary, and 
praying he might not be diverted from righteousness by the comforting touch of his new habit, 
when he looked up and saw the party from the 
Presidio floundering over the last of the sand hills. 
He shuffled off to order refreshments, and returned 
in time to disburden the carreta of Doila Ignacia 
— no mean feat — volubly delighted in the visit and 
the gossip it portended. But as he offered his 
arm to lead her into the sala, she pushed him 
aside and pointed to Concha, who had sprung to 
the ground unassisted. 

" She has come to confess, padre! '' she excaimed, her mind under the deep tiled roof of 
the corridor readjusting itself to tragedy. " I 
beg that you will take her at once. Padre Landaeta can give us chocolate and we will tell our 
terrible news to him and receive advice and consolation. ' ' 

Father Abella, not without a glimmering of the 
truth, for better than anyone he understood the 
girl he had confessed many times, besides himself having succumbed to the Eussian, led the 
way to the confessional in some perturbation of 
spirit. He walked slowly, hoping that the long 
cool church, its narrow high windows admitting 
so scant a meed of sunlight that no one of its worshippers had ever read the painted legends on 



 

the walls, and even the stations were but deeper 
bits of shade, would attune her mind to holy- 
things, and throw a mantle of unreality over 
those of the world. 

He covered his face with his hand as she told 
her story. This she did in a few words, disjointed, for she was both tired and seething. For 
a few moments afterward there was a silence ; the 
good priest was increasingly disturbed and by no 
means certain of his course. He was astonished 
to feel a tug at his sleeve. Before he could reprove this impenitent child for audacity she had 
raised herself that she might approach her lips 
more closely to his ear. 

" Mi padre! '' she whispered hoarsely, " you 
will take my part ! You will not condemn me to 
a life of misery ! I am too proud to speak openly 
to others — but I love this man more than my soul 
— more than my immortal soul. Do you hear? I 
am in danger of mortal sin. Perhaps I am already in that state. You cannot save me if he 
goes. I will not pray. I will not come to the 
church. I will be an outcast. If I marry him I 
will be a good Catholic to the end of my days. If 
I marry him I can think of other things besides — 
of my church, my father, my mother, my sisters, 




brothers. If he goes I shall pass my life 
thinking of nothing but him, and if it be true that 
heretics are doomed to hell, then I will live so that 
I may go to hell with him." 

In spite of his horror the priest was thrilled by 
the intense passion in the voice so close to his ear. 
Moreover, he knew women well, this good padre, 
for even in California they differed little from 
those that played ball with the world. So he dis- 
missed the horror and spoke soothingly. 

" What you have said would be mortal sin, my 
daughter, were it not that you are laboring under 
strong and natural excitement; and I shall absolve you freely when you have done the penance 
I must impose. You have always been such a 
good child that I am able to forgive you even in 
this terrible moment. But, my daughter, surely 
you know that this marriage can never take 
place " 

"It shall! It shall! '' 

" Control yourself, my daughter. You cannot 
bring this man into the true church. His character is long since formed and cast — it is iron. Even 
love will not melt it. Were he younger '' 

" I should hate him. All young men are insufferable to me — always have been. I have 




found my mate, and have liim I will if I have to 
hide in the hold of his ship. Ah, padre mio, I 
know not what I say. But you will help me. Only 
you can. My father thinks you as wise as a saint. 
And there are other things — my head turns round 
— I can hardly think — but you dare not lose the 
friendship of this Eussian. And my marriage 
to him would be as much for the good of the Mis- 
sions as for California herself. If you champion 
our cause, point out that not only would it be a 
great match for me, but that many ends would 
be lost by ruining my life, the Governor will find 
himself in a position to grant your prayers for 
the cargo, particularly if you first persuaded my 
father — so long they have been friends, the Gov- 
ernor could not resist if he joined our forces. 
"What is one girl that she should be held of greater 
account than the welfare of this country to which 
you are devoting your life! The happier are 
your converts the more kijidly will they take to 
Christianity — which they do not love as yet ! — the 
more faithful and contented will they be, in the 
prospect of the luxuries and the toys and the 
trinkets of the Eussian north. What is one girl  
against the friendship of Eussia for Spain? Who 
am I that I should weigh a peseta in the scale? " 




" You are Conclia Argiiello, the flower of all 
the maidens of California, and the daughter of
