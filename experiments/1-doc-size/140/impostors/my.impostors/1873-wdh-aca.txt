    treats me very gingerly, as if I were an explosive sprite, or an
    inflammable naiad from a torpedoed well, and it wouldn't be quite
    safe to oppose me, or I would disappear with a flash and a bang.

    When Dick isn't able to go with me on Fanny's account, Mr. Arbuton
    takes his place in the expeditionary corps; and we have visited a
    good many points of interest together, and now and then he talks very
    entertainingly about his travels. But I don't think they have made
    him very cosmopolitan. It seems as if he went about with a little
    imaginary standard, and was chiefly interested in things, to see
    whether they fitted it or not. Trifling matters annoy him; and when
    he finds sublimity mixed up with absurdity, it almost makes him
    angry. One of the oddest and oldest-looking buildings in Quebec is a
    little one-story house on St. Louis Street, to which poor General
    Montgomery was taken after he was shot; and it is a pastry-cook's
    now, and the tarts and cakes in the window vexed Mr. Arbuton so
    much--not that he seemed to care for Montgomery--that I didn't dare
    to laugh.

    I live very little in the nineteenth century at present, and do not
    care much for people who do. Still I have a few grains of affection
    left for Uncle Jack, which I want you to give him.

    I suppose it will take about six stamps to pay this letter. I forgot
    to say that Dick goes to be barbered every day at the "Montcalm
    Shaving and Shampooing Saloon," so called because they say Montcalm
    held his last council of war there. It is a queer little steep-roofed
    house, with a flowering bean up the front, and a bit of garden, full
    of snap-dragons, before it.

    We shall be here a week or so yet, at any rate, and then, I think, we
    shall go straight home, Dick has lost so much time already.

    With a great deal of love,

    Your Kitty.




VII.

LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM.


With the two young people whose days now lapsed away together, it could
not be said that Monday varied much from Tuesday, or ten o'clock from
half past three; they were not always certain what day of the week it
was, and sometimes they fancied that a thing which happened in the
morning had taken place yesterday afternoon.

But whatever it was, and however uncertain in time and character their
slight adventure was to themselves, Mrs. Ellison secured all possible
knowledge of it from Kitty. Since it was her misfortune that promoted
it, she considered herself a martyr to Kitty's acquaintance with Mr.
Arbuton, and believed that she had the best claim to any gossip that
could come of it. She lounged upon her sofa, and listened with a
patience superior to the maiden caprice with which her inquisition was
sometimes met; for if that delayed her satisfaction it also employed her
arts, and the final triumph of getting everything out of Kitty afforded
her a delicate self-flattery. But commonly the young girl was ready
enough to speak, for she was glad to have the light of a worldlier mind
and a greater experience than her own on Mr. Arbuton's character: if
Mrs. Ellison was not the wisest head, still talking him over was at
least a relief from thinking him over; and then, at the end of the ends,
when were ever two women averse to talk of a man?

She commonly sought Fanny's sofa when she returned from her rambles
through the city, and gave a sufficiently strict account of what had
happened. This was done light-heartedly and with touches of burlesque
and extravagance at first; but the reports grew presently to have a more
serious tone, and latterly Kitty had been so absent at times that she
would fall into a puzzled silence in the midst of her narration; or else
she would meet a long procession of skilfully marshalled questions with
a flippancy that no one but a martyr could have suffered. But Mrs.
Ellison bore all and would have borne much more in that cause. Battled
at one point, she turned to another, and the sum of her researches was
often a clearer perception of Kitty's state of mind than the young girl
herself possessed. For her, indeed, the whole affair was full of mystery
and misgiving.

"Our acquaintance has the charm of novelty every time we meet," she said
once, when pressed hard by Mrs. Ellison. "We are growing better
strangers, Mr. Arbuton and I. By and by, some morning, we shall not know
each other by sight. I can barely recognize him now, though I thought I
knew him pretty well once. I want you to understand that I speak as an
unbiassed spectator, Fanny."

"O Kitty! how can you accuse me of trying to pry into your affairs!"
cries injured Mrs. Ellison, and settles herself in a more comfortable
posture for listening.

"I don't accuse you of anything. I'm sure you've a right to know
everything about me. Only, I want you really to know."

"Yes, dear," says the matron, with hypocritical meekness.

"Well," resumes Kitty, "there are things that puzzle me more and more
about him,--things that used to amuse me at first, because I didn't
actually believe that they could be, and that I felt like defying
afterwards. But now I can't bear up against them. They frighten me, and
seem to deny me the right to be what I believe I am."

"I don't understand you, Kitty."

"Why, you've seen how it is with us at home, and how Uncle Jack has
brought us up. We never had a rule for anything except to do what was
right, and to be careful of the rights of others."

"Well."

"Well, Mr. Arbuton seems to have lived in a world where everything is
regulated by some rigid law that it would be death to break. Then, you
know, at home we are always talking about people, and discussing them;
but we always talk of each person for what he is in himself, and I
always thought a person could refine himself if he tried, and was
sincere, and not conceited. But he seems to judge people according to
their origin and locality and calling, and to believe that all
refinement must come from just such training and circumstances as his
own. Without exactly saying so, he puts everything else quite out of the
question. He doesn't appear to dream that there can be any different
opinion. He tramples upon all that I have been taught to believe; and
though I cling the closer to my idols, I can't help, now and then,
trying myself by his criterions; and then I find myself wanting in every
civilized trait, and my whole life coarse and poor, and all my
associations hopelessly degraded. I think his ideas are hard and narrow,
and I believe that even my little experience would prove them false; but
then, they are his, and I can't reconcile them with what I see is good
in him."

Kitty spoke with half-averted face where she sat beside one of the front
windows, looking absently out on the distant line of violet hills beyond
Charlesbourg, and now and then lifting her glove from her lap and
letting it drop again.

"Kitty," said Mrs. Ellison in reply to her difficulties, "you oughtn't
to sit against a light like that. It makes your profile quite black to
any one back in the room."

"O well, Fanny, I'm not black in reality."
