 

He had always been absurdly liberal in spite 
of his blue Southern blood; and a man's man 
wandering alone at the age of forty was almost foredoomed to disaster. No doubt the 
poor man had been homesick and lonesome. 

Should they receive her or should they not? 
If not, would they lose their doctor. He 
would never speak to on^ of them agaia if 
they insulted his wife. But a Bostonian, a 
possible nobody! And homely, of course. 
Angular. Who had ever heard of a pretty 
woman raised on beans, codfish, and pie for 
breakfast? 

Finally Mrs. McLane had announced that 
she should not make up her mind until the 
couple arrived and she sat in judgment upon 
the woman personally. She would call the 
day after they docked in San Francisco. If, 
by any chance, the woman were presentable, 
dressed herself with some regard to the fashion 
(which was more than Mrs. Abbott and Guadalupe Hathaway did), and had sufficient tact 
to avoid the subject of the war, she would stand 
sponsor and invite her to the first reception in 
the house on Rincon Hill. 

" But if not,'' she said grimly â€” " well, not 




 

even for Howard Talbot's sake will I receive 
a woman who is not a lady, or who has been divorced. In this wild city we are a class apart, 
above. No loose fish enters our quiet bay. 
Only by the most rigid code and watchfulness 
have vsre formed and preserved a society similar 
to that we were accustomed to in the old South. 
If we lowered our barriers we should be submerged. If Howard Talbot has married a 
woman we do not find ourselves able to associate with in this intimate little society out here 
on the edge of the world, he will have to go.

TipRS. McLANE had called on Mrs. 
lyJi Talbot. That was known to all San 
Francisco, for her carriage had stood in front 
of the Occidental Hotel for an hour. Kind 
friends had called to offer their services in setting the new house in order, but were dismissed 
at the door with the brief announcement that 
Mrs. McLane was having the blues. No one 
wasted time on a second effort to gossip with 
their leader  it was known that just so often 
Mrs. McLane drew down the blinds, informed 
her household that she was not to be disturbed, disposed herself on the sofa with her 
back to the room and indulged in the luxury 
of blues for three days. She took no nourishment but milk and broth and spoke to no one. 
Today this would be a rest cure and was 
equally beneficial. When the attack was over 
Mrs. McLane would arise with a clear complexion, serene nerves, and renewed strength for social duties. Her friends knew that her 



 

retirement on this occasion was timed to finish 
on the morning of her reception and had not 
the least misgiving that her doors would still 
be closed. 

The great double parlors of her new mansion 
were thrown into one and the simple furniture 
covered with gray rep was pushed against 
soft gray walls hung with several old portraits 
in oil, ferrotypes and silhouettes. A magnificent crystal chandelier depended from 
the high and lightly frescoed ceiling and 
there were side brackets beside the doors and 
the low mantel piece. Mrs. McLane may 
not have been able to achieve beauty with the 
aid of the San Francisco shops, but at least she 
had managed to give her rooms a severe and 
stately simplicity, vastly different from the 
helpless surrenders of her friends to mid- 
Victorian deformities. 

The rooms filled early. Mrs. McLane 
stood before the north windows receiving her 
friends with her usual brilliant smile, her manner of high dignity and sweet cordiality. She 
was a majestic figure in spite of her short stature and increasing curves, for the majesty was 
within and her head above a flat back had a 




lofty poise. She wore her prematurely white 
hair in a tall pompadour, and this with the rich 
velvets she affected, ample and long, made her 
look like a French marquise of the eighteenth 
century, stepped down from the canvas. The 
effect was by no means accidental. Mrs. 
McLane's grandmother had been French and 
she resembled her. 

Her hoopskirt was small, but the other women were inclined to the extreme of the fashion 5 as they saw it in the Godey's Lady's Book 
they or their dressmakers subscribed to. Their 
handsome gowns spread widely and the rooms 
hardly coodd have seemed to sway and undulate more if an earthquake had rocked it. The 
older women wore small bonnets and cashmere 
shawls, lace collars and cameos, the younger 
figures and small flat hats above their "water- 
falls'' or curled chignons. The husbands had 
retired with Mr. McLane to the smoking room, 
but there were many beaux present, equally 
expectant when not too absorbed. 

Unlike as a reception of that day was in 
background and costumes from the refinements 
of modern art and taste, it possessed one contrast that was wholly to its advantage. Its men 




were gentlemen and the sons and grandsons of 
gentlemen. To no one duty hgs there ever been 
such an emigration of men of good family as 
to San Francisco in the Fifties and Sixties. 
Ambitious to push ahead in politics or the professions and appreciating the immediate oppor- 
tunities of the new and famous duty, or left 
with an insuffident inheritance (particularly 
after the war) and ashamed to work in communities where no gentleman had ever worked, . 
they had set sail with a few hundreds to a land
