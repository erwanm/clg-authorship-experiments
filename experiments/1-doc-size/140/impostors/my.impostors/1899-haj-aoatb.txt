“Yes, sir, I believe so,” answered Paul.

“Then let me add my thanks to those of my wife. You have done us a
great service.”

“I am very glad to have had the chance,” said Paul.

“If you will come to my office tomorrow morning,” continued Mr.
Cunningham, “I will thank you in a more effective way. Come at ten
o’clock. As you may find it difficult to leave the office otherwise,
tell the superintendent that I have an errand for you.”

“Very well, sir.”

“Here is my business card.”

Paid took the card and rose to go.

“Mamma,” said Jennie, “can’t you invite Paul to call and see us
sometimes?”

“Certainly,” said the lady, smiling. “After what he has done he ought
to have the freedom of the house. We shall be glad to see you as a
visitor, Paul,” she said, kindly.

Paul left the house in a flutter of pleasant excitement. He was quite
determined to avail himself of an invitation so agreeable.

He crossed over to Third Avenue, and returned by the elevated railway
to the home of old Jerry.




CHAPTER VIII. PAUL MOVES TO LUDLOW STREET.


In the evening Paul found old Jerry anxiously awaiting him.

“Have you found a new room, Paul?” he asked, eagerly.

“I haven’t had time,” Paul answered, “but I’ll go at once and see about
it.”

“James will be here tomorrow,” said the old man, nervously, “and I--I
am afraid of him. He is a bad man. He wants me to give him money. You
know I have no money, Paul?” he concluded with a look of appeal.

Now Paul knew that old Jerry had money, and he could not truthfully
answer as the old man desired him.

“You say so, and that is enough,” he said.

“But it’s true,” urged Jerry, who understood the doubt in Paul’s mind.
“How could I get any money? What you give me is all we have to live on.”

“That isn’t much, at any rate.”

“No, Paul, it isn’t much. Couldn’t you give me half a dollar more? Two
dollars and a half are very little for me to live on and pay the rent,”
whined the old man.

The appeal would have moved Paul if he had not suspected that the old
man had a considerable sum of money laid away. As it was, it only
disgusted him and made him feel angry at Jerry’s attempt to deceive
him.

“Are you sure you get no money except what I give you?” he asked,
pointedly.

“What do you mean, Paul?” demanded the old man, looking alarmed. “What
gave you the idea that I had any other money?”

“At any rate,” said the telegraph boy, “you haven’t any money to throw
away on this son of yours. I have no doubt he’s a bad man, as you say.”

“He was always bad and troublesome, James was,” said old Jerry. “He was
always wanting money from the time he was a boy.”

“When he was a boy there was some reason for his asking it, but now he
is a man grown, isn’t he?”

“Yes, yes.”

“How old is he?”

“James must be nigh upon thirty,” answered Jerry, after a little
reflection. “You won’t hire too expensive a room, Paul?” he added. “You
know we are poor, very poor!”

“Not unless I am willing to pay the extra cost myself.”

“Don’t do that! Give me the extra money, Paul,” said Jerry, with eager
cupidity. “I--I find it hard to get along with two dollars and a half a
week.”

“You forget, Jerry,” said Paul, coldly, “that I must have my meals. I
can’t live without eating.”

“You eat too much, Paul, I’ve long thought so. It’s hurtful to eat too
much. It’s--it’s bad for the health.”

“I’ll take the risk,” said Paul, with a short laugh. “I am not afraid
of dying of gout, Jerry, with my present bill of fare.”

“If you wouldn’t mind my going out a few hours every day, and asking
kind gentlemen to help me, Paul, we--we could get along better.”

“I won’t hear of it, Jerry,” said Paul, sternly. “If I hear of your
going out to beg I will leave you and go off and live by myself. Then
there will be no two dollars and a half coming to you every week.”

“No, no, don’t leave me, Paul,” said Jerry, thoroughly alarmed by this
threat. “I won’t go out if you don’t want me to, though it’s very, very
foolish to stay in, when there are so many kind gentlemen and ladies
ready to give money to old Jerry.”

“Besides,” added Paul, “if you go out and stand in the street, your son
will sooner or later find you out, and make trouble for you.”

“So he will, so he will,” chimed in the miser, with the old look of
alarm on his face. “You are right, Paul, you are right. I must put it
off. I--I wish he would go away somewhere--to--to California, or some
place a great way off.”

Paul saw that he had produced the effect he intended upon the old man’s
mind, and went out at once to look for a new room. He finally found one
some half mile farther up town, in Ludlow Street--a little below Grand.

The room was better furnished than the one in which he and Jerry had
lived for some years. There was a cheap carpet on the floor, a bed in
one corner, and a shabby but comfortable lounge, on which Paul himself
proposed to sleep. The rent was two dollars a month more than they
had been accustomed to pay, but Paul concluded to say nothing of this
to the old man, but quietly to pay it out of his own pocket. It would
be but fifty cents a week, and he thought he could make that extra
sum in some way. He was beginning to be more fastidious about his
accommodations, now that he had seen how people lived uptown.

In fact, Paul was becoming ambitious. It was a very proper ambition,
