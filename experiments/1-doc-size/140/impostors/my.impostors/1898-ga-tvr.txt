 

"Yes," said Roldan. "We near the 



mountains." 



Adan stopped. " Is it the mountains 
again?" he asked. "If it is, then I, for 
one, prefer the priest." 

" The mountains never scared you half 
as badly as the priest did," said Roldan, 
cruelly. " And to say nothing of the fact 
that we need never get lost in the mountains again, the embrace of a grizzly 
would be no harder and more death-sure 
than one in the great arms of that fiend 
that wears a cassock." 

" True. You are always right. But 
promise that whatever happens you will 
not lead us into the Sierras." 

" I promise," said Roldan, much flat 
tered by this unconscious tribute to his 
leadership. 

" Do you think that priest is really a 
devil?" asked Rafael, in an awestruck 
voice. 

" When a man has insulted you, you do 
not know what you think of him," said 
Roldan, flushing hotly. " If he only were 
not a priest I'd fight him, big as he is. 



 

But at least I can outwit him. It consoles 
me to think of his fury when he goes to 
the cave and finds us gone." 

" We'd better get out of this tunnel 
before we talk about having the best of 
the priest, * said Adan. " Suppose he returns to kill us himself " 

" He will not return until to-morrow. 
Then he will have repented. He will 
promise to let us go free if we keep his 
secret. But he will not have that satis 
faction, my friends. Yesterday he had a 
friend in Roldan Castanada ; I would have 
done anything for him, gladly kept his 
secret. But to-day he has an enemy that 
he will do well to fear. A Spaniard 
never forgets an insult." 

" What shall you do ? " asked Rafael, 
eagerly. " Expose him ? " 

" No, I do nothing mean. But I proclaim at Los Angeles that gold has been 
discovered in the Californias, and in six 
days the hills will swarm, and the priest in 
his cell will gnash his teeth." 

" Ay ! " exclaimed Adan. " Do you fed 
that?" 



 

An icy blast swept down the tunnel, 
roughening skin and shortening breath. 
A few moments later the low rhythm as of 
distant water came to their ears. Roldan 
and Adan recognised that familiar music, 
and set their teeth. 

" And I prayed that I might never see 
another redwood," muttered Adan, cross 
ing himself. 

The tunnel stopped abruptly. They 
stood before a mass of brushwood, piled 
thickly to keep out wild beasts and delude 
the searching eye of hostile Indians. Be 
yond, seen in patches, was a dazzle of 
white. 

" Snow, of course," said Adan, with a 
groan. 

The boys pulled the branches apart 
without much difficulty: the priests had 
studied facility of egress and had raised 
the barrier from within. In a few moments the boys stood in the sunlight ; 
and the mountains hemmed them in. 

Adan stamped his foot savagely on the 
hard snow. u We are where we started a 
week ago," he said. " No more, no less." 



 

" No," said Roldan, who also had felt 
demoralised for a moment. "The priests 
were too clever for that. They would 
want to get into the shelter of the mountains, no more. I believe that from the 
top of that point above the tunnel we can 
see the valley." 

" Well, we can at least look," said Rafael, 
who was bitterly weary and hungry, but 
determined not to be outdone by these 
hardened adventurers. 

The boys made their way up the de 
clivity as best they could through the 
heavy snowdrifts, pulling themselves up 
by clutching at young trees and scrub. 
They were thinly clad and very cold, and 
hunger was loud of speech. When after 
a half-hour's weary climb, they reached 
the summit, they drew a long sigh of 
relief, but their enthusiasm was too moderate for words in present physical conditions. The valley lay below. Far away, 
beyond leagues of low hills and wide 
valleys something white reflected the sun. 
It was the Mission.
