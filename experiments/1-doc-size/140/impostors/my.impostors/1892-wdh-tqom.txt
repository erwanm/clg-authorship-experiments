"Oh, I'm sorry for that. I don't understand what excuse she has, though,
with a physician for her husband. You must turn hom[oe]opathy. Dr.
Morrell, do you think it's true that Jack Wilmington will offer himself
to Sue Northwick, now that it's come to the worst with her? Wouldn't it
be romantic?"

"Very," said the doctor. He craned his head out of the buggy, as if to
see whether he could safely drive into the ditch, and pass Mrs. Munger.
He said politely, as he started, "Don't disturb yourself! I can get by."

She sent a wail of reproach after him, and then continued toward South
Hatboro'. As she passed the lodge at the gate of the Northwick avenue,
where the sisters now lived, she noted that the shades were closely
drawn. They were always drawn on the side toward the street, but Mrs.
Munger thought it interesting that she had never noticed it before, and
in the dearth of material she made the most of it, both for her own
emotion, and for the sensation of others when she reached South
Hatboro'.

Behind the drawn shades that Mrs. Munger noted, Adeline Northwick sat
crying over the paper that Elbridge Newton had pushed under the door
that morning. It was limp from the nervous clutch and tremor of her
hands, and wet with her tears; but she kept reading her father's letter
in it, and trying to puzzle out of it some hope or help. "He must be
crazy, he must be crazy," she moaned, more to herself than to Suzette,
who sat rigidly and silently by. "He couldn't have been so cruel, if he
had been in his right mind; he couldn't! He was always so good to us,
and so thoughtful; he must have known that we had given him up for dead,
long ago; and he has let us go on grieving for him all this time. It's
just as if he had come back from death, and the first he did was to tell
us that everything they said against him was true, and that everything
we said and believed was all wrong. How could he do it, how could he do
it! We bore to think he was dead; yes, we bore that, and we didn't
complain; but this is more than any one can ask us to bear. Oh, Suzette,
what can we say, now? What can we say, after he's confessed himself that
he took the money, and that he has got part of it yet? But I know he
didn't! I know he hasn't! He's crazy! Oh, poor, poor father! Don't you
think he must be crazy? And where is he? Why don't he write to us, and
tell us what he wants us to do? Does he think we would tell any one
where he was? That shows he's out of his mind. I always thought that
if he could come back to life somehow, he'd prove that they had lied
about him; and now! Oh, it isn't as if it were merely the company that
was concerned, or what people said; but it's as if our own father, that
we trusted so much, had broken his word to us. That is what kills me."

The day passed. They sent Mrs. Newton away when she came to help them at
dinner. They locked their doors, and shut themselves in from the world,
as mourners do with death. Adeline's monologue went on, with the brief
responses which she extorted from Suzette, and at last it ceased, as if
her heart had worn itself out in the futile repetition of its griefs.

Then Suzette broke her silence with words that seemed to break from it
of themselves in their abrupt irrelevance to what Adeline had last said.
"We must give it up!"

"Give what up?" Adeline groaned back.

"The house--and the farm--and this hovel. Everything! It isn't ours."

"Not ours?"

"No. That letter makes it theirs--the people's whose money he took. We
must send for Mr. Putney and tell him to give it to them. He will know
how."

Adeline looked at her sister's face in dismay. She gasped out, "Why, but
Mr. Putney says it's ours, and nobody can touch it!"

"That was before. Now it is theirs; and if we kept it from them we
should be stealing it. How do we know that father had any right to give
it to us when he did?"

"Suzette!"

"I keep thinking such things, and I had better say them unless I want to
go out of my senses. Once I would have died before I gave it up, because
he left it to us, and now it seems as if I couldn't live till I gave it
up, because he left it to us. No, I can never forgive him, if he is my
father. I can never speak to him again, or see him; never! He is dead to
me, now!"

The words seemed to appeal to the contrary-mindedness that lurks in such
natures as Adeline's. "Why, I don't see what there is so wrong about
father's letter," she began. "It just shows what I always said: that his
mind was affected by his business troubles, and that he wandered away
because he couldn't get them straight. And now it's preyed so upon him
that he's beginning to believe the things they say are true, and to
blame himself. That's the way I look at it."

"Adeline!" Suzette commanded, with a kind of shriek, "Be still! You
know you don't believe that!"

Adeline hesitated between her awe of her sister, and her wish to persist
in a theory which, now that she had formulated it for Suzette's
confusion, she found effective for her own comfort. She ventured at
last, "It is what I said, the first thing, and I shall always say it,
Suzette; and I have a right."

"Say what you please. I shall say nothing. But this property doesn't
belong to us till father comes back to prove it."

"Comes back!" Adeline gasped. "Why, they'll send him to State's prison!"

"They won't send him to State's prison if he's innocent, and if he
isn't--"

"Suzette! Don't you dare!"

"But that has nothing to do with it. We must give up what doesn't belong
to us. Will you go for Mr. Putney, or shall I go? I'm not afraid to be
seen, if you don't like to go. I can hold up my head before the whole
world, now I know what we ought to do, and we're going to do it; but if
we kept this place after that letter, I couldn't even look you in the
face again." She continued to Adeline's silence, "Why, we needn't either
of us go! I can get Elbridge to go." She made as if to leave the room.

"Wait! I can't let you--yet. I haven't thought it out," said Adeline.

"Not thought it out!" Suzette went back and stood over her where she sat
in her rocking-chair.

"No!" said Adeline, shrinking from her fierce look, but with a gathering
strength of resistance in her heart. "Because you've been thinking of
it, you expect me to do what you say in an instant. The place was
mother's, and when she died it came to me, and I hold it in trust for
both of us; that's what Mr. Putney says. Even supposing that father did
use their money--and I don't believe he did--I don't see why I should
give up mother's property to them." She waited a moment before she said,
"And I won't."

"Is half of it mine?" asked Suzette.

"I don't know. Yes, I suppose so."

"I'm of age, and I shall give up my half. I'm going to send for Mr.
Putney." She went out of the room, and came back with her hat and gloves
on, and her jacket over her arm. She had never been so beautiful, or so
terrible. "Listen to me, Adeline," she said, "I'm going out to send
Elbridge for Mr. Putney; and when he comes I am not going to have any
