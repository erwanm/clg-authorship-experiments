have seen her." 

He broke into the loudest of laughs. 
"Why, my dear boy, I told you just now 
I 've absolutely not. I say, don't you believe me?" 

There was something she was already so 
afraid of that it covered up other fears. 
"Didn't you come back to see her?" she 
inquired in a moment. "Didn't you come 
back because you always want to so much ? " 

He received her inquiry as he had received 
her doubt with an extraordinary absence 
of resentment. " I can imagine, of course, 
why you think that. But it doesn't explain 
my doing what I have. It was, as I said to 
you just now at the inn, really and truly you 
I wanted to see. " 

She felt an instant as she used to feel 
when, in the back-garden at her mother's, 
she took from him the highest push of a 
swing high, high, high that he had 
had put there for her pleasure and that 
had finally broken down under the weight 
and the extravagant patronage of the cook. 
"Well, that's beautiful. But to see me, 
you mean, and go away again ? " 





" My going away again is just the point. 
I can't tell yet it all depends." 

" On Mrs. Beale ? " Maisie asked. " She 
won't go away." He finished emptying his 
coffee-cup and then when he had put it 
aside leaned back in his chair and let her 
see that he smiled at her. This only added 
to her idea that he was in trouble, that he 
was turning somehow in his pain and trying 
different things. He continued to smile, 
and she presently went on: "Don't you 
know that?" 

" Yes, I may as well confess to you that as 
much as that I do know. She won't go away. 
She 'll stay." 

"She'll stay. She'll stay," Maisie re- 
peated. 

"Just so. Won't you have some more 
coffee?" 

"Yes, please." 

" And another buttered roll ? " 

"Yes, please." 

He signed to the hovering waiter, who 
arrived with the shining spout of plenty in 
either hand and with the friendliest interest 
in mademoiselle. " Les tartines sent d." 
Their cups were replenished, and while 
he watched almost musingly the bubbles in 





the fragrant mixture, "Just so just so," 
Sir Claude said again and again. " It's 
awfully awkward ! " he exclaimed when the 
waiter had gone. 

"That she won't go?" 

Well everything ! Well, well, well ! " 
But he pulled himself together; he began 
again to eat. "I came back to ask you 
something. That 's what I came back for." 

" I know what you want to ask me," Maisie 
said. 

" Are you very sure ? " 

"I'm almost very. " 

"Well, then, risk it. You mustn't make 
me risk everything. " 

She was struck with the force of this. 
"You want to know if I should be happy 
with them" 

" With those two ladies only ? No, no, old 
man : vous-n 'y-$tes pas. So now there ! " 
Sir Claude laughed. 

"Well then, what is it?" 

The next minute, instead of telling her 
what it was, he laid his hand across the 
table on her own and held her as if under 
the prompting of a thought. "Mrs. Wix 
would stay with her?" 

" Without you ? Oh yes now. " 





"On account, as you just intimated, of 
Mrs. Beale's changed manner? " 

Maisie, with her sense of responsibility, 
focussed both Mrs. Beale's changed manner 
and Mrs. Wix's human weakness. "I think 
she talked her over. " 

Sir Claude thought a moment. "Ah, 
poor dear!" 

"Do you mean Mrs. Beale?" 

"Oh no Mrs. Wix." 

" She likes being talked over treated 
like any one else. Oh, she likes great 
politeness," Maisie expatiated. "It affects 
her very much." 

Sir Claude, to her surprise, demurred a
