Maisie, with an inspiration, pounced on 
his arm. " Has she gone ? " 

He met her eyes, and then she could see 
that his own were really much graver than 
his manner. " Gone ? " She had flown to 
the door, but before she could raise her hand 
to knock he was beside her and had caught 
it. " Let her be. I don't care about her. 
I want to see you." 

Maisie fell back with him. "Then she 
hasn't gone? " 

He still looked as if it were a joke; but 
the more she saw of him the more she could 
make out that he was troubled. "It 
wouldn't be like her!" 

She stood looking up at him. " Did you 
want her to come ? " 

"How can you suppose ?" He put it 
to her candidly. " We had an immense row 
over it." 

" Do you mean you 've quarrelled ? " 

Sir Claude hesitated. "What has she 
told you?" 

"That I 'm hers as much as yours. That 
she represents papa. " 

His gaze struck away through the open 





window and up to the sky ; she could hear 
him rattle in his trousers' pocket his money 
or his keys. " Yes that 's what she keeps 
saying. " It gave him for a moment an air 
that was almost helpless. 

"You say you don't care about her," 
Maisie went on. "Do you mean you've 
quarrelled ? " 

"We do nothing in life but quarrel." 

He rose before her, as he said this, so soft 
and fair, so rich, in spite of what might 
worry him, in restored familiarities, that it 
gave a bright blur to the meaning to what 
would otherwise, perhaps, have been the 
tangible promise of the words. " Oh, your 
quarrels ! " she exclaimed with discourage- 
ment. 

" I assure you hers are quite fearful ! " he 
laughed. 

"I don't speak of hers. I speak of 
yours. " 

"Ah, don't do it till I 've had my coffee! 
You're growing up clever," he added. 
Then he said : " I suppose you 've break- 
fasted?" 

" Oh no I 've had nothing." 

" Nothing in your room " he was all com- 
punction. "My dear old man! we'll 





breakfast then together." He had one of 
his happy thoughts. "I say we'll go 
out." 

"That was just what I hoped. I've 
brought my hat." 

"You are clever! We'll go to a cafe"." 
Maisie was already at the door; he glanced 
round the room. "A moment my stick." 
But there appeared to be no stick. "No 
matter; I left it oh!" He remembered, 
with an odd drop, and came out. 

" You left it in London ? " she asked as 
they went downstairs. 

" Yes in London : fancy ! " 

"You were in such a hurry to come," 
Maisie explained. 

He had his arm round her. "That must 
have been the reason." Half way down 
he stopped short again, slapping his leg. 
"And poor Mrs. Wix!" 

Maisie' s face just showed a shadow. " Do 
you want her to come ? " 

" Dear, no I want to see you alone. " 

" That 's the way I want to see you  " she 
replied. " Like before. " 

" Like before ! " he gayly echoed. " But 
I mean has she had her coffee? " 

"No, nothing." 





"Then I 'll send it up to her. Madame ! " 
He had already, at the foot of the stair, 
called out to the stout patronne, a lady who 
turned to him, from the bustling, breezy 
hall, a countenance covered with fresh 
matutinal powder and a bosom as capacious 
as the velvet shelf of a chimney-piece, over 
which her round white face, framed in its 
golden frizzle, might have figured as a showy 
clock. He ordered, with particular recom- 
mendations, Mrs. Wix's repast, and it was 
a charm to hear his easy, brilliant French : 
even his companion's ignorance could meas- 
ure the perfection of it. The patronne, 
rubbing her hands and breaking in with
