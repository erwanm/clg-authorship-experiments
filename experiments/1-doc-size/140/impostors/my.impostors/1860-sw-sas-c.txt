"I don't know what good that would do, Mrs. Somers."

"Nor I--till I try," said the lady smiling at her. "But if the mere
suggestion is so powerful, what may not the reality do? I'll say one
thing for Mr. Linden--he makes all those boys come into church and get
seated before the service begins--which nobody else ever did yet; if
they ever tried. I was curious to see how it would be last Sunday when
he wasn't there--but they were more punctual than ever. It's quite a
comfort--if there's anything I do hate to see, it's a troop of men and
boys outside the door when they ought to be in. What are you afraid
he'll say to Sam, Faith?"

Faith's eyes were looking down. The question brought them up, and then
her smile was as frank as her blushes had been. "I am not afraid he'll
say anything, Mrs. Somers."

"I don't know why he should, my dear," said Mr. Somers. "We all like to
use our eyes--you can't very well blame a boy."

"O Mr. Somers!" said his wife--with that air which a woman puts on when
she says she believes, what she wouldn't for the world say if she
believed,--"of course you think that! Don't I know how you broke your
heart after a green veil when you were in college? I don't think it's
been right whole since. Now I have some feeling for Sam--or his future
wife."

"Well Mrs. Derrick, what shall I tell Julius?" said Miss Harrison as
she rose to go.

"Tell him?" said Mrs. Derrick enquiringly. "He wouldn't care to hear
anything about me, if you did tell him, Miss Sophy."

"Well!--he'll have to come and talk to you himself," said Miss
Harrison. "Faith, stand up for the right."

Faith went to the door with her and returned ushering in a new-comer,
even the wife of Farmer Davids.

"Husband wanted me to come and see how Mr. Linden was," she said in
meek explanation of her appearance. "He would have come hisself, but he
was forced to be in the field, and he said he wisht I'd come myself.
How is he, ma'am?"

"I hope he's better,"--said Mrs. Derrick, giving her new visiter a kind
reception and a seat. "He don't get strong very fast. How are you all
at home, Mrs. Davids?"

"We're considerable comfortable, ma'am," said Mrs. Davids taking the
chair in an unobtrusive spirit. "I am happy to have the occasion to
make your acquaintance better. Husband would have come hisself, only he
couldn't. Mr. Linden don't get strong?"

"Not very fast," said Mrs. Derrick. "I don't know just when the doctor
'll let him go to school again. I suppose you're anxious about Phil,
Mrs. Davids. But all the boys have to be out, now."

"Yes ma'am, we're anxious--and husband is anxious about Mr. Linden, and
he sent me to know. But there is such a change in Phil, ma'am,"--she
said turning to Mrs. Somers,--"such a change, you wouldn't believe! he
never would go to school before--not regular--not for nobody--not for
his father, nor for me; and it was mor'n my life was worth. My husband,
he said it was my fault; but I don't know how 'twas! And now sir, he
don't want a word spoke to him! he's off before it's time in the
morning--and he learns too, for I catch him at it; and my husband don't
think anything in the world is too good for Mr. Linden; nor of course,
I s'pose, I don't. But however he's managed or overcome it, to make
Phil draw in harness, I don't know, and husband says he don't. And
ma'am, was those pears good? or what does Mr. Linden like? If it's on
the farm he'll get it."

It would have taken more conversational skill than Mrs. Derrick
possessed, to give a summary answer to all this; but her simplicity
answered as well, after all.

"I guess he'll like what you've been saying better than anything, Mrs.
Davids; I'll tell him."

"Do," said Mrs. Davids. "I wisht you would. Husband would have said it
completer. He thinks ma'am," (turning to Mrs. Somers again) "that Mr.
Linden is a wonderful man! And I'm of the opinion he's handsome."

Faith had been sitting, quiet and demure, for some time past, hearing
what was going on; but this last sentence drove her to the right about
like lightning. She found something to do in another part of the room.

"Did you ever hear anybody say he wasn't?" said Mrs. Somers. "Mr.
Somers, it's time we were going. Ah--there's Squire Stoutenburgh!
Faith--come here!"

And Squire Stoutenburgh, appearing in the doorway like the worthy
father of his stout son, bowed to the company.

"Well Mrs. Derrick--" he said,--"good day Mr. Somers--and Mrs.
Somers! I beg pardon--Well Miss Faith! I'm glad it is well, I'm sure.
My dear, how do you do?"

"Why very well, sir!" said Faith.

"Why so it is!" said Squire Stoutenburgh taking hold of both her hands
and looking at her. "Sam said you were as pale as a ghost when he
carried you down to the spring--but Sam don't always see straight when
he's excited. You needn't be frightened if I kiss you, my dear you know
I always do, and always have--since you were a year old," said the
Squire as he took his wonted privilege.

Faith gravely submitted, not letting the Squire however get any further
than her cheek; which ought to have contented him.

"Sam was very good to me yesterday, sir," she answered.

"I think, Squire," said Mr. Somers, "your son was--a--in luck, as we
say. A fortunate chance! What most people would have thought
no--a--disagreeable office."

"Sam's a good boy--" said his father,--"a very good boy--always was. He
does crow a little over Dr. Harrison, I must say. But what shall we do
with the doctor, Mr. Somers?--what does he deserve for running away
with our Pattaquasset roses and turning them into meadow lilies? Yes,
yes, Miss Faith--you may look as pink as you please now--it won't help
the matter. What shall we do with him, sir? My dear," said Squire
Stoutenburgh seating Faith by his side and dropping his voice, "you're
growing wonderfully like your father!"

A changed, sweet glance of Faith's eyes answered him.

"Yes!"--the Squire repeated meditatively and looking at her.--"Ah he
was a fine man! I used to think he couldn't be better--but I s'pose he
is now. My dear, you needn't wonder when I tell you that I thought more
of your mother last night than I did of you. But you don't remember all
about that. Well--I shall go home and tell Mrs. Stoutenburgh that
you're as pretty as a posie, and then she won't care what else is the
matter," he said, getting up again. "Mrs. Somers, I see the parson
durstn't say a word about Dr. Harrison before you."

"I--I declare I don't think Dr. Harrison is very much to be blamed,
Squire," said the parson thus called upon. "And Mrs. Somers is so well
able to speak for herself--I have no doubt, Squire Stoutenburgh, if it
wasn't for Mrs. Somers,--I dare say I might like to do as much as the
doctor did, myself!"
