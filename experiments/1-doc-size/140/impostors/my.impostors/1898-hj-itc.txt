ing. This fear was indeed, in her shameless 
deflections, never very far from her, and 
was mixed in the oddest way with depres 
sions and disappointments. It was dreadful, 
as she trembled by, to run the risk of looking 
to him as if she basely hung about ; and yet 
it was dreadful to be obliged to pass only at 
such moments as put an encounter out of 
the question. 

At the horrible hour of her first coming 
to Cocker 's he was always it was to be 
hoped snug in bed ; and at the hour of her 
final departure he was of course she had 
such things all on her fingers -ends dressing 
for dinner. We may let it pass that if she 
could not bring herself to hover till he was 
dressed, this was simply because such a 
process for such a person could only be 





terribly prolonged. When she went in the 
middle of the day to her own dinner she 
had too little time to do anything but go 
straight, though it must be added that for 
a real certainty she would joyously have 
omitted the repast. She had made up her 
mind as to there being on the whole no 
decent pretext to justify her flitting casually 
past at three o clock in the morning. That 
was the hour at which, if the ha penny 
novels were not all wrong, he probably came 
home for the night. She was therefore 
reduced to merely picturing that miraculous 
meeting toward which a hundred impossibili 
ties would have to conspire. But if nothing 
was more impossible than the fact, nothing 
was more intense than the vision. What 
may not, we can only moralise, take place in 
the quickened, muffled perception of a girl 
of a certain kind of soul? All our young 
friend 's native distinction, her refinement of 
personal grain, of heredity, of pride, took 
refuge in this small throbbing spot; for 
when she was most conscious of the abjec- 





tion of her vanity and the pitifulness of her 
little nutters and manoeuvres, then the con 
solation and the redemption were most sure 
to shine before her in some just discernible 
sign. He did like her!

He never brought Cissy back, but Cissy 
came one day without him, as fresh as before 
from the hands of Marguerite, or only, at 
the season 's end, a trifle less fresh. She 
was, however, distinctly less serene. She 
had brought nothing with her and looked 
about with some impatience for the forms 
and the place to write. The latter conveni 
ence, at Cocker's, was obscure and barely 
adequate, and her clear voice had the light 
note of disgust which her lover 's never 
showed as she responded with a There? 
of surprise to the gesture made by the 
counter-clerk in answer to her sharp 
inquiry. Our young friend was busy with 
half-a-dozen people, but she had despatched 
them in her most business-like manner by 
the time her ladyship flung through the bars 
the light of reappearance. Then the direct 
ness with which the girl managed to receive 






this missive was the result of the concen 
tration that had caused her to make the 
stamps fly during the few minutes occupied 
by the production of it. This concentra 
tion, in turn, may be described as the effect 
of the apprehension of imminent relief. It 
was nineteen days, counted and checked off, 
since she had seen the object of her homage; 
and as, had he been in London, she should, 
with his habits, have been sure to see him 
often, she was now about to learn what 
other spot his presence might just then 
happen to sanctify. For she thought of 
them, the other spots, as ecstatically 
conscious of it, expressively happy in it. 

But, gracious, how handsome was her 
ladyship, and what an added price it gave 
him that the air of intimacy he threw out 
should have flowed originally from such a 
source ! The girl looked straight through the 
cage at the eyes and lips that must so often 
have been so near his own looked at them 
with a strange passion that, for an instant, 
had the result of filling out some of the gaps, 





supplying the missing answers, in his cor 
respondence. Then, as she made out that 
the features she thus scanned and associated 
were totally unaware of it, that they glowed 
only with the color of quite other and not 
at all guessable thoughts, this directly 
added to their splendour, gave the girl the 
sharpest impression she had yet received of 
the uplifted, the unattainable plains of 
heaven, and yet at the same time caused 
her to thrill with a sense of the high com 
pany she did somehow keep. She was with 
the absent through her ladyship and with 
her ladyship through the absent. The only 
pang but it didn' t matter was the proof 
in the admirable face, in the sightless pre 
occupation of its possessor, that the latter 
hadn't a notion of her. Her folly had gone 
to the point of half believing that the other 
party to the affair must sometimes mention 
in Eaton Square the extraordinary little
