 

Bartlett, very gently : " Then I think that man 
will be lost for keeping his conscience too clean. 
Cummings has invented a new sin." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " James, James ! You told me 
that Mr. Bartlett didn't know." 

General Wyatt, contritely : " I let you think so, 
Margaret ; I didn't know what else to do." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " Oh, James ! " 

Constance : " Oh, papa ! " She turns with 
bowed head from her father's arms, and takes 
refuge in her mother's embrace. General Wyatt, 
released, fetches a compass round about the par- 
lor, with a face of intense dismay. He pauses in 
front of his wife. 

General Wyatt : " Margaret, you must know the 
worst, now." 

Mrs. Wyatt, in gentle reproach, while she softly 
caresses Constance's hair: "Oh, is there anything 
worse, James ? " 

General Wyatt, hopelessly : " Yes : I 'm afraid 
I have been to blame," 

Bartlett : " General Wyatt, let me retire. I " 

General Wyatt: "No, sir. This concerns you, 
 



 

too, now. Your destiny has entangled you with 
our sad fortunes, and now you must know them 
all." 

Constance, from her mother's shoulder: "Yes, 
stay, whatever it is. If you care for me, 
nothing can hurt you any more, now." 

General Wyatt : " Margaret, Constance ! If I 
have been mistaken in what I have done, you must 
try somehow to forgive me ; it was my tenderness 
for you both misled me, if I erred. Sir, let me ad- 
dress my defense to you. You can see the whole 
matter with clearer eyes than we." At an implor- 
ing gesture from Bartlett, he turns again to Mrs. 
Wyatt. " Perhaps you are right, sir. Margaret, 
when I had made up my mind that the wretch 
who had stolen our child's heart was utterly unfit 
and unworthy " 

Constance, starting away from her mother with a 
cry : " Ah, you did drive him from me, then ! I 
knew, I knew it ! And after all these days and 
weeks and months that seem years and centuries of 
agony, you tell me that it was you broke my heart ! 
No, no, I never will forgive you, father ! Where 



 

is he? Tell me that! Where is my husband the 
husband you robbed me of? Did you kill him, 
when you chose to crush my life ? Js he dead ? 
If he 's living I will find him wherever he is. No 
distance and no danger shall keep me from him. 
I 'll find him and fall down before him, and implore 
him to forgive you, for I never can! Was this 
your tenderness for me to drive him away, and 
leave me to the pitiless humiliation of believing 
myself deserted ? Oh, great tenderness ! " 

General Wyatt, confronting her storm with per- 
fect quiet : " No, I will give better proof of my 
tenderness than that." He takes from his pocket- 
book a folded paper which he hands to his wife : 
"Margaret, do you know that writing?" 

Mrs. Wyatt) glancing at the superscription : " Oh, 
too well ! This is to you, James." 

General Wyatt : " It 's for you, now. Read it." 

Mrs. Wyatt, wonderingly unfolding the paper and 
then reading : " fi I confess myself guilty of forging 
Major Cummings's signature, and in consideration 
of his and your own forbearance, I promise never to 
see Miss Wyatt again. I shall always be grateful 



 

for your mercy; and' James, James! It isn't 
possible ! " 

Constance, who has crept nearer and nearer while 
her mother has been reading, as if drawn by a re- 
sistless fascination: "No, it isn't possible! It's 
false ; it 's a fraud ! I will see it." She swiftly 
possesses herself of the paper and scans the hand- 
writing for a moment with a fierce intentness. 
Then she flings it wildly away. " Yes, yes, it 's 
true ! It 's his hand. It 's true, it 's the only true 
thing in this world of lies ! " She totters away to- 
ward the sofa. Bartlett makes a movement to 
support her, but she repulses him, and throws her- 
self upon the cushions. 

General Wyott : " Sir, I am sorry to make you 
the victim of a scene. It has been your fate, and 
no part of my intention. Will you look at this 
paper ? You don't know all that is in it yet." He 
touches it with his foot. 

Bartlett, in dull dejection : " No, I won't look at 
it. If it were a radiant message from heaven, I 
don't see how it could help me now." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " I 'm afraid you ' ve made a terrible 
mistake, James." 



 

General Wyatt: "Margaret! Don't say that!" 

Mrs. Wyatt : u Yes, it would have been better to 
show us this paper at once, better than to keep
