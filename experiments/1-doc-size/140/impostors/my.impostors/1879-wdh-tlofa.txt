have pitied him, and might have interceded so far 
as to set him nearer right in her eyes ; but he 
felt that she avoided him, too ; there were no more 
walks on the deck, no more readings in the cabin ; 
the checker-board, which professed to be the His- 
tory of England, In 2 Vols., remained a closed 
book. The good companionship of a former time, 
in which they had so often seemed like brothers 
and sister, was gone. " Hicks has smashed our 
Happy Family," Staniford said to Dunham, with 
little pleasure in his joke. " Upon my word, I 
think I had better have left him in the water." 
Lydia kept a great deal in her own room ; some- 
times when Staniford came down into the cabin he 
found her there, talking with Thomas of little 
things that amuse children ; sometimes when he 
went on deck in the evening she would be there in 
her accustomed seat, and the second mate, with 



 

face and figure half averted, and staying himself 
by one hand on the shrouds, would be telling her 
something to which she listened with lifted chin 
and attentive eyes. The mate would go away when 
Staniford appeared, but that did not help matters, 
for then Lydia went too. At table she said very 
little ; she had the effect of placing herself more 
and more under the protection of the captain. The 
golden age, when they had all laughed and jested 
so freely and fearlessly together, under her pretty 
sovereignty, was past, and they seemed far dis- 
persed in a common exile. Staniford imagined she 
grew pale and thin ; he asked Dunham if he did 
not see it, but Dunham had not observed. " I think 
matters have taken a very desirable shape, socially," 
he said. "Miss Blood will reach her friends as 
fancy-free as she left home." 

" Yes," Staniford assented vaguely; " that's the 
great object." 

After a while Dunham asked, u She 's never said 
anything to you about your rescuing Hicks ? " 

" Rescuing ? What rescuing ? They 'd have had 
him out in another minute, any way," said Stani- 
ford, fretfully. Then he brooded angrily upon the 
subject : " But I can tell you what : considering all 
the circumstances, she might very well have said 
something. It looks obtuse, or it looks hard. She 
must have known that it all came about through 
my trying to keep him away from her." 

" Oh, yes ; she knew that," said Dunham ; " she 
spoke of it at the time. But I thought " — 



 

" Oh, she did ! Then I think that it would be 
very little if she recognized the mere fact that 
something had happened." 

" Why, you said you hoped she would n't. You 
said it would be embarrassing. You 're hard to 
please, Stamford." 

" I shouldn 't choose to have her speak for my 
pleasure," Stamford returned. " But it argues a 
dullness and coldness in her " — 

" I don't believe she 's dull ; I don't believe she's 
cold," said Dunham, warmly. 

" What do you believe she is ? ' 

" Afraid." 

" Pshaw ! " said Staniford. 

The eve of their arrival at Messina, he discharged 
one more duty by telling Hicks that he had better 
come on to Trieste with them. " Captain Jenness 
asked me to speak to you about it," he said. " He 
feels a little awkward, and thought I could open 
the matter better." 

" The captain 's all right," answered Hicks, with 
unruffled humility, " but I 'd rather stop at Mes- 
sina. I 'm going to get home as soon as I can, — 
strike a bee-line." 

" Look here ! " said Staniford, laying his hand 
. on his shoulder. " How are you going to manage 
for money ? " 

" Monte di Pieta," replied Hicks. " I 've been 
there before. Used to have most of my things in 
the care of the state when I was studying medi- 



 

cine in Paris. I've got a lot of rings and trinkets 
that'll carry me through, with what's left of my 
watch." 

" Are you sure ? " 

" Sure." 

" Because you can draw on me, if you 're going to 
be short." 

" Thanks," said Hicks. " There 's something I 
should like to ask you," he added, after a moment. 
" I see as well as you do that Miss Blood isn 't the 
same as she was before. I want to know — I can't 
always be sure afterwards — whether I did or said 
anything out of the way in her presence." 

" You were drunk," said Staniford, frankly, " but 
beyond that you were irreproachable, as regarded 
Miss Blood. You were even exemplary." 

" Yes, I know," said Hicks, with a joyless laugh. 
" Sometimes it takes that turn. I don't think I 
could stand it if I had shown her any disrespect. 
She 's a lady, — a perfect lady ; she 's the best girl 
I ever saw." 

" Hicks," said Staniford, presently, " I haven 't 
bored you in regard to that little foible of yours. 
Aren 't you going to try to do something about 
it?"
