growing, in some places, to the very water's edge, and 
overhanging it. But he saw the eddies far up, dimpling 
out towards the middle of the river, and slowly floating 
down. If God was looking out of that clear summer 
sky, what did He see? 

Stephen Dane took his way along the river's edge, 
swinging around the trees, striding over the stones, and 
occasionally giving a lurch into the water. Some 
strange impulse urged him on. When he reached the 
spot, the waves had not yet subsided into quiet. The 
bank was higher here, a sort of bluif ; the river deeper, 
and so shaded that he could not see clearly to the 
bottom if there had been anything to see, which 
there was not. Probably a loosened stone had rolled 
down. 





He turned now to take the shortest cut out of the 
woods. The trees were less dense, the grass quite 
ra'nk. It had been freshly trampled, and, O God ! 
what was this? He stooped down to examine the 
sharp edge of a stone. A clot of blood, and humau 
skin, a wisp of coarse brown hair matted in it ! 

There are some strange moments in life. Stephen 
Dane, without knowing why he did it, wrenched this 
stone from its foundation, rolled it over, keeping his 
eyes away from this terrible sign of crime, and gave it 
a vigorous push into the river. Then he fitted a 
smaller one in its place, covering up the spiders, 
worms, and lion-ants, that were hurrying in every direc- 
tion. Some curious spell held him in a giant's grasp. 
He glanced furtively through the trees, he took a 
lingering survey of the place, and then cautiously 
threaded his way out. The shadows grew weird and 
spectral. He stepped lightly, and drew strange, half- 
repressed breaths. Then he stumbled over the root of 
a tree, and kicked something that was not a stone. 
He passed it first, returned, groped about until he 
found it. A memorandum and note book with dark 
leather covers. On the first page was written in a stiff, 
but legible hand, " Thomas Vennard, Tregony, 18 ." 

He struck his forehead in a wild, startled way. lie 
looked through the dim branches with staring eyeballs, 
transfixed by a horrible thought that seemed to cleave 
through his brain. Did the lifeless body of Thomas 



 

Yennard, the man he had so lately envied, lie over 
yonder in the river? The cold sweat started at every 
pore. His limbs trembled violently. His teeth chat- 
tered. A faint, sickening sensation stole over him. 
He here with the murdered man's property in his 
hands ! Some awful fascination compelled him to 
clutch it tightly, when he would have thrown it from 
him. Then he staggered on, reeling like a drunken 
man. 

A step startled him. Coming in this direction, too. 
By the straggling sunlight, whose last beams gave an 
orange-red glow, he recognized the figure, the sham- 
bling gait. O Heaven I was his father's very life put 
into his hands ! 





THEN Archy Dane met his son, his thin, gray 
 face grew deathly white. His knees smote 
together, his hands fell limp and helpless by his side, 
and his lips twitched nervously. 

" Stephen ! " he exclaimed, in a faint, sickly voice, 
more of terror than surprise. His lank jaws fell as if 
stricken with palsy. 

"Were you looking for me, father?" 

It was a strange question, as Stephen himself knew, 
after he had put it, but it had come first into his mind. 

" No I " The voice was broken with aguish 
trembling. 

"It's growing dark in the woods." 

" Yes." No movement followed this. Only the two 
men breathing hoarse and fearfully. 

" Joe will have supper ready by the time we reach 
home." 

" Go on, boy," he said roughly, albeit in a tremulous 
tone. 



 

Stephen Dane was shocked with the crime that had 
been so foully committed there by the river's edge. 
This man's hands were red with blood, his soul black 
with a stain, only God could wipe off. His own father I 
Had he been sent to save him ? 

Perhaps because his own heart had been so bitter 
a while ago, he experienced a deep pity for this poor old 
man. Yet his lips must be sealed now and forever. 

"Well," he returned, "don't wait out late." 

Presently he looked back, and saw the bent figure 
groping around in the falling darkness. Then he only 
heard a faint rustle, and could see nothing. But he 
knew two bony hands were hunting over the moss 
and dead leaves, for something he carried in his 
pocket. 

He skulked along a back lane nearer the river. 
How lonely it was in this amethyst glow ! How the 
long hills drooped with purple shadows, their outlines 
lost in soft indistinctness. Gray half lights upon the 
bolder rocks, faint touches of red along the shore, 
where filmy threads of vapor began to curl. The 
hollow blue of the upper sky seemed a haven in which 
these fleets of gold might come to anchor in an un- 
troubled sea of rest. Where was there any rest for 
him? 

The bright reflection had entirely disappeared behind 
the hills when Stephen reached home. Supper had
