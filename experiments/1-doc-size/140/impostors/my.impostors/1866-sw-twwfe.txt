of the Philistine's, lying south of Gaza. And this is a different country from that I have been describing. Look here 
--on the western shore of Palestine, from as high up as 
Ekron down, there is a level plain of corn-flelds ; and this 
melts off into the pastures of the wilderness with no break 
or interruption. It is something like the finest parts of our 
own western country ; it is as lovely and as rich as the 
Mississippi valley; but indeed it is more rich. The most 
superb crops are gathered there year after year, with no 
manure put on the land, and with the most miserable sort 
of culture; and this is what has been going on for four 
thousand years. Our land would wear out long before that 
time." 

"Why, our land will not stand a single year without 
manuring," said Liph. " Not and bear good crops.'' 

"Here, at the East. The soil is richer in the Mississippi 
valley ; but the Shephelah, the corn plain of the Philistines, 
is richer than all It is the granary of Palestine, which 
indeed was named from its name of Philistia. This plain 
melts off gradually to the south into the sandy desert ; and 
eastward merges itself in that wide pasturing country, below 
the hills of Judah, of which I have spoken. In this plain, 
in the richest of the land, the Philistines had taken possession." 



 

"But I thought they were wicked people, and the enemies 
of the Jews," said Daniel " The Jews were for ever fighting 
the Philistines." ' 

"Afterwards. The Jews were not in existence yet ; and 
the Philistines had not long been in the land. They were 
not natives, but 'emigrants' — 'strangers;' so their name 
means ; and the Bible says they came out from Caphtor, in 
the regions of Upper Egypt. ' Have not I brought up the 
Philistines from Caphtor ? ' the Lord said by the prophet 
Amos. And in Deuteronomy it is said, 'The wims which 
dwelt in Hazerim,' (Hazerim means nomad dwellings, or 
dwellings of wandering people) — ' The whims which dwelt in 
Hazerim, even unto Azzah' — or Gaza— 'the Caphtorima, 
which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt 
in their stead.' In the same sort of Hazerim, or transient 
abodes, it seems they also dwelt ; pasturing their herds 
hither and thither. But the Philistines were a warlike 
people, even then; for their king had a 'captain of the 
host' for one of his servants ; and had the manners of a despotic and powerful prince too ; as it appears by his taking 
Sarah into his family. That was a high-handed measure, 
often enough adopted in those times, and sometimes in 
these times ; but it bespeaks power in the aggressor. It is 
a way of showing power, that I have known sheikhs and 
emirs in that country to use; taking distinguished ladies 
for their wives, even when killing the ladies' husbands was 
a necessary consequence. So that Abraham had worldly 
reason enough for the request he had made to Sarah, — 
' This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me ; at 
every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my 
brother.'" 

"It didn't do him much good, uncle Sam." 

"Lies never do anybody much good. Tiny. 

" But was this a lie, sir ? He was her brother." 

"Not after he became her husband. No; to ail intents 
and purposes it was a lie; meant to mislead." 

" But Abraham was a good man, sir." 

" ' A just man f alleth seven times, and riseth up iigain.' It 





is much better that he should not fall But Abraham was a 
good man, and the Lord took care of him. He gained no- 
I thing by his falsehood. He might as well have trusted the 
Lord at first. In a dream, Abimelech was warned that the 
man whom he had wronged was under the particular care of 
Heaven ; and that it would be at the peril of his life if he did 
not undo all the wrong he had done." 

"And then Abimelech gave him presents," said Priscilla; 
" ' sheep and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants ; ' 
just aa> Pharaoh had done. He grew great every way." 

"How was Abraham a prophet, uncle Sam? The Bible 
says he was a prophet ; what did he tell ? " 

"Nothing of future events. Tiny. The first meaning of 
prophet was not a foreteller, but an interpreter. One who 
made known the ways of God to men ; that is what it meant, 
and means still 

" Now Abraham had full leave to dwell in the land of the 
Philistines, wherever he pleased; and in the rich country 
south of Gaza I suppose he made his home, at Gerar ; and 
there, it is likely, the next year Isaac was born. The fulfilment of part of God's promise to Abraham, and a pledge 
of the rest." 

"A pledge of what, uncle Sam?" 

" Of all good things. Tiny. In this way. Isaac was the 
promised seed, you know. God had told Abraham he should 
have a son in his old age ; and besides, had told him that 
in this son the blessing should come. With him God would 
establish the covenant He had made with Abraham ; and that 
covenant was, you remember, that He would be a God to 
him and to his seed after him ; that He would give them 
the land of Canaan ; and that all the nations of the earth 
should be blessed in him. Abraham knew what that meant ; 
that the promised Deliverer should come by and by in the 
line of Isaac's children. And so Sarah understood it ; for 
she said, ' God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear 
will laugh with me.' It was not a joy for her alone. One 
was coming, some tinie, among the descendants of Isaac's 
family, who would be the Desire of all nations. And so. 



 

when at last the birth of Jesus was promised to Mary, she 
said, ' He hath holpen His servant Israel, in remembrance 
of His mercy ; as He spake to ourfathersy to Abraham, and to 
his seed for ever.' ' To perform the mercy promised to our 
fathers, and to remember His holy covenant ; the oath which 
He sware to our father Abraham.' Isaac was well named. 
His name is daughter/" 

"There were so many people bom, in whose family the 
Lord Jesus was to come," I said. " I cannot remember them 
all." 

"First there was Seth," said uncle Sam. "He was the 
appointed one of all Adam's sons."
