and was confident of himself. Myrrha 
indeed was adorable, another Psyche. Yet 
had she been sister to the Harpies it would 
have mattered now not in the least. Beauty, 
genius, virtue, or the lack of them, anything 
and everything he was aware could be 
talked away, yet never wealth. It was that 
she represented,, and it was that he proposed 





to get. At the moment, had some newer 
Diogenes flashed a lantern, it would have 
disclosed not a man but an aim. 

Between conception and accomplishment, 
however, there is a margin, and there is also 
fatality ; or, if you prefer, there is that chain 
of circumstance, the interconnection of cause 
and effect in which we are all immeshed. 
On the morrow the highroad which Quain 
had discowered became suddenly tortuous 
and obscure. Mr. Attersol sent for him. 

"Oswald," he began at once, "Myrrha 
has told me what occurred yesterday. 
Don't let it happen again" 

"I love her," Quain with blunt boldness 
retorted. "And she loves me." 

Mr. Attersol nodded. " I dare say you 
both think so, but it is a mistake" 

" Mistake ! " 

" Don't interrupt me. I said mistake, that 
is sufficient. The other evening you spoke 
of going to Florida ; if you still wish, you 
may." 

And as Quain said nothing he added : 






"In any event, you will, until further notice, 
oblige me by discontinuing your visits to 
the house. That will do." 

Before the window of the cage to which 
Quain's stool had been removed, he found, 
after this interview, four men in line. As he 
raised the curtain, the first man handed in a 
cheque and glared savagely. 

" Another minute," he declared, " and I 
would have had it protested." 

" Protest and be damned," Quain gnashed 
back. And to him, to the others, he tossed 
out money ragefully, without a second 
counting, indifferent of results. He was 
furious, angry with fate, angry with the 
world. 

" Here, Brisbane," he called. And relinquishing his stewardship to an under-clerk, 
in half an hour he was at Myrrha's door. 

But Miss Attersol was not at home. He 
went away, idled at a club, and returning 
rang again. The answer was the same. 
After an hour's interval, he reappeared. 
This time he was admitted. 





As the girl entered the drawing-room, he 
almost sprang at her. 

" Do you know what your father says ? 
I am not to come here. I told him I loved 
you ; I told him, too, that you loved me. 
He says it is a mistake. Is it a mistake, 
Myrrha ? Don't you love me ? " 

Her hands were in his, his eyes in hers. 
The question he saw was needless, but he 
repeated it with all a true lover's show of 
poignant anxiety. 

" Don't you, Myrrha ? " 

She drew her hands away ; but her eyes 
still rested in his own, and it was with her 
eyes she answered. 

At once his arm was about her. " Forever ? " he cried, in a voice in which there 
was a reminiscence of the stage. " Forever ? Myrrha, tell me, you will not 
change ? " 

The girl smiled, yet such a joyless smile, 
one which was nearer to tears than to 
laughter. 

" He will never consent, Oswald " 





With the bravest gesture he interrupted : 

" And what of that ? I may be poor, but 
I have two arms. They are all in all for 
you." 

The girl shook her head : " It is not that. 
He told me last night that it would break 
his heart if I did not give you up." 

" And you ? " 

" I told him it would break mine if I did." 

Well ? " 

" We will have to wait, Oswald. He told 
me I would kill him. He said " 

From beyond came a jostle of portiere 
rings. The girl turned. At the door her 
father stood, his hand on the curtain. For 
a second that seemed a minute no one
