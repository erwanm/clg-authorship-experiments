He would not let the doctors give him morphia. He 
said he would die like a man, and he did, with all 
his senses about him. While he lay dying, I was 
with him, and then he told me all the truth. The 
girl would not be able to conceal it much longer. 
There was no time to bring her to his bedside and 
marry her while he still breathed. He could not 
even leave her money, for he was a minor. He could 
do nothing for her and her parents would turn her 
into the street ; in any case she was ruined. He was 
in frightful agony of mind for her sake, he was dying 
before my eyes, powerless to help her and taking his 
suffering and his fault with him to the next world, 
and he was my friend. I did what I could. I gave 
him my word of honour that I would marry her legally, 
give her and her child my name, and provide for them 
as well as I could. He thanked me — I shall never 
forget how he looked — and he died quietly, half an 
hour afterwards. You know now. I kept my word. 
That is all." 





The Princess looked at his quiet face a moment in 
silence, and all that was best in her rose up through 
all that was artificial and worldly, and untruthful and 
vain. 

"I did not know that there were such men," she 
said simply. 



CHAPTER XX 

"So he got out," said Gigi to Toto, filling the 
latter's glass to the brim. 

" May he die assassinated ! " answered Toto. " I 
will burn a candle to the Madonna every day, in 
order that an apoplexy may seize him. He is the 
devil in person, this cursed engineer. Even the earth 
and the water will not have him. They spit him out, 
like that." 

Toto illustrated the simile with force and noise be- 
fore drinking. Gigi's cunning face was wreathed in 
smiles. 

" You know nothing," he observed. 

" What is it ? " asked Toto, with his glass in his 
hand and between two sips. 

" There was old Sassi, who was hurt, and the en- 
gineer's gaol-bird mason-servant. They were with 
him. It was all in the Messaggero this morning." 

" I know that without the newspaper, you imbecile. 
It was I that told you, for I saw all three pass under 
the window while I was locked in. Is there anything 
else you know ? " 

" Oh, yes ! There was another person with them." 

"I daresay," Toto answered, pretending blank in- 
difference. " He must have been close to the wall as 







they went by. What difference does it make since 
that pig of an engineer got out ? " 

"The other person was caught with him when the 
water rose," said Gigi, who meant to give his infor- 
mation by inches. 

" Curse him, whoever he was ! He helped the en- 
gineer and that is why they got out. No man alone 
could have broken through that wall in a night, except 
one of us." 

" The other person was only a woman, after all," 
answered Gigi. "But you do not care, I suppose." 

" Speak, animal of a Jesuit that you are ! " cried 
Toto. " Do not make me lose my soul ! " 

Gigi smiled and drank some of his wine. 

" There are people who would pay to know," he 
said, " and you would never tell me whether the sluice 
gate of the ' lost water ' is under number thirteen or 
not." 

"It is under number thirteen. Master Judas. 
Speak ! " 

" It was the little fair girl of Casa Conti who was 
caught with the engineer in the vaults." 

Even Toto was surprised, and opened his eyes and 
his mouth at the same time. 

" The little Princess Sabina ? " he asked in a low 
voice. 

Gigi shrugged his shoulders with a pitying air and 
grinned. 

" I told you that you knew nothing," he observed in 
triumph. "They were together all night, and she 



 

slept in his room, and the Senator's wife came to get 
her in the morning. The engineer took the porter off 
to the cellars before they came down, so that he should 
not see her pass ; but he forgot me, the old carpenter 
of the house, and I opened the postern for the two 
ladies to go out. The little Princess's skirt had been 
torn. I saw the pins with these eyes. It was also 
spotted with mud which had been brushed off. But 
thanks be to heaven I have still my sight, I see, and 
am not blind." 

"Are you sure it was she?" asked Toto, forgetting 
to curse anybody. 

" I saw her as I see you. Have I not seen her grow 
up, since she used to be wheeled about in a baby 
carriage in Piazza Navona, like a flowfer in a basket ?
