trickling down her cheeks, one by one, till they fell sideways upon her
bare white neck. Many they were and long they fell, and when they ceased
at last, her face was very white and still, as if she were quite dead,
and dead of a sorrow that could be consoled only in heaven.

She had dreamed that the Vestal's vow was broken at last, and that she
was sitting alone at night on the steps of the closed Temple, leaning
back against the base of a pillar, watching the stars that slowly
ascended out of the east; and she was thinking of what she had been, and
that she should never again stand within the holy place to feed the
sacred fire with the consecrated wood, and sweep the precious ashes into
the mysterious pit beneath the altar. Never again was she to write down
the records of the lordly Roman unions that had kept the stock great and
pure and the free blood clean from that of slaves for a thousand years.
Never might she sit at the feet of the Chief Virgin in the moonlit
court, listening to tales of holy Vestals in old time, while the slow
water murmured in the channels between one fountain and another.

It was all over, all ended, all behind her in the past for ever. Her vow
was broken, because her veiled cheek had touched the cheek of a living,
breathing man who had laid a strong hand upon her neck and had pressed
her close to him, she consenting, and always to consent. She was not to
die for it, since it was no mortal sin, but she was no longer a Vestal
now, and the Temple and the house of the pure in heart were shut against
her henceforth and would not be opened again. She knew that she had
passed the threshold for the last time, and that the man she loved would
soon come and take her away to another life. After that there would be
no fear in the world, since she would always be with him, and he would
make her forget all. But he had not come yet, and while she waited her
tears flowed quietly and sadly for all that was no more to be hers, but
most of all because she had broken a high and solemn promise which had
been the foundation of her life. In the old dream, when the Vestals were
dismissed from their office each to her own home, she was the most
faithful of them all, to the very end. But now she had been the very
first to yield, and they had put her out of their midst, sadly and
silently, to wait alone in the night for him she loved. So she waited
and wept, and the night wind seemed to freeze the salt tears on her face
and neck; yet he did not come.

Then she heard his step; but she was wakened by the soft sound of the
latch bolt of her door in its socket, and she sprang to her feet,
straight and white, with a little sharp cry, for the fancied sound had
always frightened her as nothing else could. This time she had not
turned the key, and the door opened.

"Did I startle you, child?" asked her mother's voice, kindly. "I am
sorry. Signor Lamberti is in the drawing-room. I think you had better
come. He has heard of the article in the Figaro, and is reading it
now."

"I will come in a minute, mother," Cecilia answered, turning her face
away. "Let me slip on my frock."

"It is only Signor Lamberti," the Countess observed, rather
thoughtlessly. "But I will send you Petersen."

The door was shut again, and Cecilia heard her mother's tripping
footsteps on the glazed tiles in the corridor. She knew that she had
blushed quickly, for she had been taken unawares, but the room was
darkened and her mother had noticed nothing. She was suddenly aware that
her cheeks and her neck were wet, and she remembered what she had dreamt
and wondered that her tears should have been real. She had let in more
light now and she looked at herself in the glass with curiosity, for she
did not remember to have cried since she had been a little girl. The
dried tears gave her face a stained and spotted look she did not like,
and she made haste to bathe it in cold water. Even the near-sighted
Petersen might see something unusual, and she would not let Lamberti
guess that she had been crying on that day of all days.

It was all very strange, and while she dressed she wondered still why
the real tears had come, and why she had dreamt she had broken her vow.
She had never dreamt that before, not even when she used to meet
Lamberti in her dreams by the fountain in the Villa Madama. It was
stranger still that she should not have been able to call up the waking
vision in the old way. It was as if some power she had once possessed
had left her very suddenly, a power, or a faculty, or a gift; she could
not tell what it was, but it was gone and something told her that it
would not return. She made haste, and almost ran along the broad
passage.

When she went into the drawing-room Lamberti was standing with the
Figaro in his hand, before her mother who was sitting down. He bowed
rather stiffly, though he smiled a little, and she saw that his blue
eyes glittered and his face had the ruthless look she used to dread. She
knew what it meant now, and was pleased. She wished she could see him
shake the wretch who had written the article; she was glad that he was
just what he was, not too tall, strong, active, red-haired and angry, a
fighting man from head to foot, roused and ready for a violent deed. She
had waited for him so long, outside the closed Temple of Vesta in the
cold night wind!

"It is not the article that matters," he said, taking it for granted
that she knew the contents. "It is what Guido would feel if he read it."

"Especially just now," observed the Countess, looking at Cecilia.

"What are you going to do?" Cecilia asked as quietly as she could.
"Shall you go to Paris?"

"No! this was written in Rome. I will wager my life that the lawyer who
is mentioned here wrote it all and got some clever Frenchman to
translate it for him. I know the fellow by name."

"I thought Monsieur Leroy was at the bottom of it," said Cecilia.

Lamberti looked at her a moment.

"I daresay," he said. "I am sure that the Princess never meant that
anything of this sort should be printed. Did Guido ever tell you about
her money dealings with him?"

Guido had never mentioned them, of course, and Lamberti explained in a
few words exactly what had happened, and the nature of the receipts
Guido had given to his aunt.

"I daresay you are right about Monsieur Leroy," he concluded, "for the
old lady is far too clever to have done such an absurd thing as this,
and it is just like his blundering hatred of Guido."

"I wish he were here," said Cecilia, looking at Lamberti's hands. "I
wonder what you would do to him."

"The lawyer is here, which is more to the purpose," Lamberti answered.

"You cannot fight a lawyer, can you?" asked the young girl. "You cannot
shoot him."

"One can without doubt," returned Lamberti, smiling. "But it will not be
necessary."

"My dear child," cried the Countess in a reproachful tone, "I had no
idea you could be so bloodthirsty! Your father fought with Garibaldi,
but I am sure he never talked like that."

"Men have no need of talking, mother. They can fight themselves."

"May I take the Figaro with me?" asked Lamberti. "I may not be able to
buy a copy. By the bye, Baron Goldbirn is your guardian, is he not? He
must have important relations with the financiers in Paris."
