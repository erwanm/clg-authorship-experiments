is the new scholar. Chandler Firth.” 

Why, deportment is all right.” 

He’s the sweetest little fellow, just as good as 
gold, and knows a great many things. But he sits 
and dreams, perhaps he sees visions, for his face 
is the face of an angel. I’d like to know what 
is in his brain that so absorbs him. He simply 
doesn’t study, and makes queer guesses that 
oftener miss than hit. But his folks ought to 
know.” 

Firth. Grafton boy, isn’t he? Why, that’s 
the name of a great houseful of children whose 
mother married a Mr. Mann. My cousin, Mrs. 
Colmer, lives in the same street, a real stylish place. 
Linden Avenue. It made a great talk. He’s do- 
ing everything for them.” 



“ The older boy is a good scholar. Chandler 
spells and reads very well.” 

When Miss King gave him his card, she said: 
“ Chandler, I am sorry it isn’t better. You have 
fallen below last week; then you were strange, and 
everything was new.” 

The boy flushed and stood with downcast eyes. 

‘‘You’ll try to do better, won’t you? I should 
be sorry to have you lose your standing.” 

The face was so sweet and deprecating that she 
really couldn’t use any more decisive threat. 

“ Yes, ma’am,” in a very low tone. 

Then he turned away. It was awful; and now 
his face was scarlet with shame. Mother would 
have to see it; perhaps his new father, who was 
doing so much for him. He had not studied. It 
wouldn’t do to lose the card, some one might find 
it. If he dared to tear it up! But it must be 
handed in on Monday. He was sorry and 
ashamed, and took the long walk home by himself 
when he had the ticket in his pocket. 


CHAPTER X 


COMING OUT OF DREAMLAND 

Mrs. Mann sat at the machine sewing, and 
Laurel was beside her making Dolly an apron. 
When she reached the end of the seam, she glanced 
around and saw the sweet, sad face, the beseeching 
eyes, and kissed him, saying: “ What is it, dear? ” 

Chan drew a long breath and took the card out 
of the envelope. 

It isn’t very good,” he answered faintly. 

‘‘Oh, Chan!” in a disappointed tone. “Were 
the lessons hard ? ” 

He put his arms around her neck and pressed 
his cheek against hers. 

“ N-o-o. But somehow I couldn’t study. Such 
beautiful sounds kept coming in my mind, organ 
tones like those Mr. Evans plays, and singing 
like that at the hospital, only more beautiful. 
And — I forgot about — about the lessons. Oh, 
Mother, music world is a place of delight, and you 
feel as if you were soaring up to the clouds of 
summer mornings.” 


He did look beautiful in his enthusiasm. But 
this would not answer. 

“ My dear, there is a great deal for you to 
learn besides music. Father would feel dread- 
fully disappointed if you spent your time dream- 
ing. Oh, Chan, think how good he has been to 
you! And if the music is going to spoil you that 
way, you will have to give it up until you are 
older.” 

“ Oh, Mother ! ” with a pleading cry. 

“ Yes. You lost a good deal by the hurt, you 
know, and now that you are well you must make 
it up. I want father to be proud of you as well 
as to love you, and you can study.” 

He leaned his head down on her shoulder. He 
began to feel very much ashamed of the record, 
and that his dear father should see it! 

“ Couldn’t you sign it. Mother ? ” 

‘‘Yes, I could; but it isn’t my place.” 

There was a silence. Then he said in a low 
tone: 

“ And I mustn’t be a sneak,” as he put the card 
back in the envelope. 

“ No, dear.” 

“ Could I play a little on the piano ? ” 

“ I am going to trust you to do better. So if 
you redeem your standing next week, there shall 




be no prohibition. And father loves music 

SO. 

Yes, you may trust me.” 

He went slowly downstairs, but as he was go- 
ing to seat himself he saw his father at the desk 
in the library. It would be hard to go over 
there, but he must do it, and putting it ofl would 
be keeping up the sense of shame. So he went 
and stood by him, watching the pen gliding over 
the paper to the end. 

Chan, boy,” and the arm was about him, I
