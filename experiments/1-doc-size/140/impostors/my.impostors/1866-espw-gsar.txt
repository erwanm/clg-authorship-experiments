before his time. Say something sort of gay 
and festive, can’t you ? ” 

Gypsy’s face flushed as she bent over to wrap 
up a picture and put it in the trunk. Her good 
sense told her that she had been doing a 
thoughtless thing. Her good heart taught her 
how to bring back the old merry Gypsy at a 
moment’s notice. Tom heard no more sighs. 

“ I ’m glad your last night is Sabbath night,” 
said his mother, when it came. 



“ I wonder what ’s the reason people always 
love each othermore Sunday nights,” said Gypsy, 
pushing her cricket a little nearer to Tom. 
“ It ’s funny, isn’t it? ” 

“It’s Tom’s last night,” said Winnie to 
Patty, “ and you can just give me some of that 
rharboob preserve. Mother ’s in the parlour. I 
had two flabjacks for supper. Don’t you wish 
Tom would go off to college every night? ” 

“ Did you put your wallet in your inside vest 
pocket, Tom, as I advised?” asked Mr. Breynton 
several times in the pauses of the evening. 
And the last time he asked to see it, and slipped 
in an extra five-dollar bill. 

The singing, and the quiet talk, and the 
hymns they sang, and most of all his father’s 
prayer, made Tom very still. Towards the end 
of the evening he slipped away for a few min- 
utes, and Gypsy followed him. She found him 
out on the doorsteps, with his hat pushed down 
over his forehead. 

“Want me, Tom?” 

“ Yes, sit down.” 


She sat down beside him, and putting up her 
hand on his shoulder, began to stroke him in a 
comical, demure way, very much as she would 
a kitten, — Gypsy never did things exactly like 
other people. But Tom liked it. 

“Homesick, Tom?” 

“ No,” growled Tom, pushing his hat savagely 
over his eyes. 

“ Not a bit, dear? ” 

The hat went nearly down to his chin. 

“Homesick before I’m out of the house? 
What nonsense you talk, Gypsy ! ” 

Tom got up and strode severely up and down 
the yard several times. Then he came back 
and seemed to feel better. 

“ I wonder if you ’ll ever think about us Sunday 
nights,” said Gypsy, indiscreetly. 

Tom began to cough. It was some time 
before he thought it necessary to make any 
reply. When he did, he said : — 

“ My dear Gypsy, you don’t understand 
about these things. You are a girl. Fellows 
at college have plenty to think of; but then I 



don’t expect to — forget you exactly — no.” 
And the wonderful part of it was that Tom had 
to get up and walk down the yard again. 

“ I hope you won’t get hazed,” said Gypsy, 
presently. Tom’s young eyes flashed. 

“ I should like to see them try it, that ’s all ! 
I ’d shoot the first man that touched me. The 
only thing is, father won’t let me have a re- 
volver, which I think is rough on the Trojans.” 

“ Can’t he afford it?” 

“ Oh, I guess so. But he ’s afraid I should 
shoot myself, or something, I don’t know what. 
As if I weren’t old enough to take care of my- 
self! ” 

“ I hope you ’ll have a nice time,” said Gypsy, 
thinking best to change the subject. 

“ Of course I shall ; a regular jolly. I 
haven’t looked forward to college all my life 
for nothing. I mean to get all the fun I can 
out of it.” 

“ How splendid it’ll be ! I wish I could go. 
But then you go to study, you know, father 
says, and mother too.” 



“ Oh, study, yes, of course,” said Tom, care- 
lessly ; “ but I mean to have a good time any- 
way T 

Gypsy looked a little troubled. She knew 
how Tom felt, and she was so sure that she 
should feel exactly the same way if she were in 
his place, that she had not the conscience to 
scold him ; at the same time, she doubted if he 
were quite right about it. She had a dim idea 
that when people went to college “just for 
fun,” they did not come out of it quite as good 
as they went in; a flitting thought of Francis 
Rowe ; a shudder at the bare possibility that her 
brother should ever be like Sarah’s. This may 
have had something to do with her answer; for 
she said, speaking low and earnestly, — 

“ Tom, do you remember my saying, out in 
the boat, that I wished you had something to 
start on?"' 

“ I guess so.” 

“ Well, I do wish just that. I can’t explain, 
— I never can explain things, you know, Tom; 
but I ’ve got an idea there somewhere, now
