" In a moment, dear. Come upstairs with me 
and you shall see it," answered Aunt Faith, 
trying to lead her away. But Bessie resisted 
wildly. " I will not go ! " she said. " I shall 
stay with Hugh until the last. Give me my 
letter ! It is mine ! You have no right to keep it. 
Give it to me, I say ! " 

Alarmed at the expression of her eyes, Aunt 
Faith took out the captain's note-book, opened it, 
and handed it to her niece. The words were 
scrawled across the page in irregular lines ; 
there seemed to be two paragraphs. The first 





was this : " Bessie, try to be good, dear ; I love 
you." The second : " I can say the two sen- 
tences, Aunt Faith, — I am saying them now. — 
Hugh." 

The writing was trembling and indistinct, and 
the last words barely legible ; the signature was 
but a blur. 

As Bessie deciphered the two messages, a 
sudden tremor shook her frame ; then she read 
them over again, speaking the words aloud as 
if to give them reality. " Oh Hugh ! Hugh ! " 
she cried, " how can I live without you ! " 

With a quick movement, Aunt Faith turned 
up the gas and threw back the pall ; then she 
put her arms around the desolate girl and raised 
her to her feet. "Look at him, Bessie!" she 
said earnestly ; " look at dear Hugh, and think 
how hard it must have been for him to write 
those words, how hard he must have tried, how 
much he must have loved you ! " 

Hugh's face was calm, the curling, golden hair 
concealed the cruel wound on his temple, and 



 

there was a beautiful expression about the 
mouth, that strange peace which sometimes 
comes after death, as if sent to comfort the 
mourners. His right hand, bruised by the hard 
night's work, was covered with vine-leaves, but 
the left, the hand that had held the little child, 
was folded across his breast ; he was dressed as 
he had been in life, and some one had placed 
a cross on his heart, — a little cross of ivy simply 
twined. " My soldier, true soldier of the cross, " 
murmured Aunt Faith, stooping to kiss the cold 
brow. " In those hours it all became clear to 
you. 'Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbe- 
lief ; ' — ' Lord be merciful to me a sinner.' 
With these two sentences on your lips, you 
passed into another country. Farewell, Hugh! 
You will not return to us, but. we shall go to 

you." 

Bessie had not raised her head from Aunt 
Faith's shoulder. She had not looked upon 
Hugh since they brought him home, and now 
she stood holding the note-book in her hands, 
and trembling convulsively. 





" Look at him, Bessie," said Aunt Faith 
again ; " look at dear Hugh. He is speaking to 
you now, in that dying message." 

At last Bessie raised her head and looked upon 
the still face long and earnestly ; then, throw- 
ing herself down upon her knees, she burst into 
a passion of wild grief, calling upon Hugh, be- 
seeching him to speak to her, and listening for 
his answer in vain. Aunt Faith did not try to 
check her, for these were her first tears ; she 
knew they would relieve that tension of the head 
and heart, which, if long continued, must have 
ended in physical and mental prostration. After 
a few moments, Sibyl came in, and the two 
watched over Bessie until she sank exhausted to 
the floor, when they lifted her slight form and 
bore her upstairs. 

Then, from the sitting-room, two of Hugh's 
friends came in, turned down the light, covered 
the still face, and went back to keep their watch 
in the desolate hours of mourning. 

The sun was sinking towards the west in unclouded 
brightness when a throng gathered in 

the old stone house to pay their last tribute of 
respect to the dead. " Fitz Hugh Warrington, 
aged twenty years and ten months," said the 
inscription on the coffin-lid, and many tears 
dropped upon it, as, one by one, the friends bent 
over to take a farewell look at the handsome face 
with its clustering golden hair. Then came the 
voice of the aged pastor, reading the words of the 
Gospel of St. John, — Hugh's favorite chapter, the 
fourteenth. A hymn followed, — Hugh's favor- 
ite hymn, " Brightest and best of the sons of the 
morning," and then they all knelt in prayer, the 
fervent prayer mingled with tears which ascends 
from the house where the dearest one of all is 
dead. 

Mr. Leslie took no part in the services ; he 
stood with Sibyl as one of the family. Aunt 
Faith leaned upon the arm of Mr. Hastings, who 
had come from New York immediately upon 
hearing of the accident. Tom and Gem stood 
together, but Bessie was alone ; she wished no 





support, she said ; she only wanted to stay by 
Hugh until the last. So they let her stand by 
the head of the coffin alone, — alone* with her 
dead, and with her God. 

Then came another hymn, and slowly the 
bearers lifted all that was left of their friend,
