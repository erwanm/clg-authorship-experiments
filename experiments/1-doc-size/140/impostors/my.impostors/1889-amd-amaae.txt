you learned any thing, Miss Thurston ? I was very 
glad you never suggested the ownership of a hen, or 
he would have drawn into his shell at once." 

" It is all very elegant," replied Eve. " It has 
taken time and money to perfect all this, and is like 
the wonderful fruit-farms. But sometimes a peach 
or a pear off your own tree may have as fine a flavor, 
and one of your own hens may lay as fresh an egg 
for your breakfast. I picked up a few words of 
wisdom," and she laughed. " You see, every thing 
that is not perfect is taken out of the choice flocks, 
so their faults and failings are not propagated. 
But, after all, some old woman summed it up : 'A 
good hen ought to lay twelve dozen eggs a year ; and 
at twenty-five cents a dozen, she earns three dollars, 
and eats up one.' Now, the profit is, making her 
eggs bring in more than three dollars ; and keeping 
her good and warm in the winter hot food, with 
pepper and spices ; plenty of fresh warm water ; 
when she cannot find worms or bugs, give her some 
meat." 

" You have it quite down to a business point, 
Miss Thurston," Pryor said with admiration, as well 
as amusement. 

" I strive to bring every thing to a business point," 
she replied sententiously. " I have started out to be 



 

a business woman, and to make the eight hundred 
dollars that I am justly entitled to." 

" Eight hundred ? Why just eight hundred ? " 

Eve laughed merrily. How pretty and dainty 
and bewitching she looked, though I had remarked 
of late she had not put on her sweetest ways for 
Gordon Pryor. 

We explained about the money. 

" See here, Miss Eve ; wouldn't it be a stupendous 
joke if every man and woman should set out to get 
his and her share, and the children as they grew up ? 
By Jove ! what would become of the millionnaires ? 
You certainly have discovered the great panacea, 
the secret of equalizing the crooked and unjust 
things of this world." 

We all laughed. 




CHAPTER IX 

A PASTORAL IN HENS 

JOE added six dollars to his store the next week. 
He wanted his clothes so badly, that Eve proposed 
to lend him the rest ; and we went down to North- 
wood, wliile she kept station with a big boy at hand. 
Through the winter she had added to her other 
accomplishments the train-signals, and quite a 
knowledge of telegraphy, and could manage very 
well; though, when I had occasion to leave her, I 
always made certain that Frank Barr would be 
about. He soon became one of Eve's devoted 
admirers, and I think she wilfully encouraged him. 
I know there were times when Pryor wanted to kick 
him, out of pure jealousy that a smile should be 
wasted on a cub of thirteen. 

I never saw a happier lad than Joe this morning. 
He seemed bubbling over with a wholesome, grate 
ful joy. We found a very nice business-suit for 
fourteen dollars, and his shoes were three and a half 
more. It left him just five dollars in my debt. We 
went into the library to change some books, and then 



 

sauntered up the busy street, somewhat disfigured, 
I must own, by saloons. The blind-door of one 
opened, and a young lad not more than eighteen 
staggered out. I saw a hot flush go over Joe's face : 
then suddenly he broke away from me, and threw 
his arm over the shoulder of the boy. I walked on 
slowly. Perhaps the good seed had taken root 
when Joe desired to save some one else. 

" I couldn't help it ! " he exclaimed, as he rejoined 
me, his eyes full of tears. "I thought of the 
wretched object that I was when I came to you, 
and how good you were ; and I wanted to say a 
word. He has a mother and two sisters oh, why 
must he break their hearts ! and he told me where 
he lived, 19 Cross Street. Maybe it isn't true. 
Oh, why can't they shut up these dens and holes 
that drag boys and men down to destruction ! " 

Why not, some of them at least ? I counted five 
on one side of the block, four on the other. Two 
or three young men dropped into one, even as I 
counted. If they cannot be strong for themselves, 
has Government no duty towards its citizens ? 

Eve declared herself very proud of Joe in his 
new clothes. He went to church with us on Sunday, 
though he insisted on sitting in a far-back seat. 
Now, why should not some one take him by the hand 
in a friendly manner? I had begun to like Mr. 



 

Bradford a good deal, in some sermons ; but it 
seemed to me that he took himself and his religion 
too far off, and, when he called you to follow, he was 
out of sight. If you could walk side by side ; if you 
could feel and believe that it was not the system 
that was so dear, but the human soul it might snatch 
from the ways of destruction ! 

One of the sweetest and bravest things was Eve 
walking right over to Joe when church was out, and 
taking him under her protection by the cordial smile 
and inclination of her head. There were three or
