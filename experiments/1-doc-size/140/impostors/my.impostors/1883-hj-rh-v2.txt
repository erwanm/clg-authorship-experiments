" Extremely so." 

" I have been eager, grasping, obstinate, vain, ungrate 
ful, indifferent, cruel ? " 

"I have accused you mentally of all these things 
with the exception of vanity." 

"You have often hated me?" 

" Never. I should have parted company with you 
before coming to that." 

" But you have wanted to part company, to bid me go 
on my way and be hanged ? " 

" Repeatedly. Then I have had patience and forgiven 
you." 

Forgiven me, eh ? Suffering all the while ? " 

Yes, you may call it suffering. " 

"Why did you never tell me all this before?" 

" Because my affection was always stronger than my 
resentment ; because I preferred to err on the side of 
kindness ; because I had myself in a measure launched 
you in the world and thrown you among temptations ; 
and because nothing short of your unwarrantable aggres 
sion just now could have made me say these painful 
things." 

Roderick picked up a blade of long grass and began 
to bite it ; Rowland was puzzled by his expression and 
manner. They seemed strangely cynical ; there was 
something revolting in his deepening calmness. "I 
must have been hideous," Roderick presently resumed. 

" I am not talking for your entertainment," said Row 
land. 

" Of course not. For my edification ! " As Roderick 
said these words there was not a ray of warmth in his 
brilliant eye. 

" I have spoken for my own relief," Rowland went 
on, " and so that you need never again go so utterly 
astray as you have done this morning." 



"It has been a terrible mistake, then?" What his 
tone expressed was not wilful mockery, but a kind of 
persistent irresponsibility which Rowland found equally 
exasperating. He answered nothing. "And all this 
time," Roderick continued, "you have been in love? 
Tell me the woman." 

Rowland felt an immense desire to give him a visible 

palpable pang. " Her name is Mary Garland," he said. 

Apparently he succeeded. The surprise was great ; 

Roderick coloured as he had never done. " Mary 

Garland ? Heaven forgive us ! " 

Rowland observed the "us ;" Roderick threw himself 
back on the turf. The latter lay for some time staring 
at the sky. At last he sprang to his feet, and Rowland 
rose also, rejoicing keenly, it must be confessed, in his 
companion 's confusion. 

" For how long has this been ? " Roderick demanded. 

" Since I first knew her." 

" Two years ! And you have never told her ? " 

"Never." 

" You have told no one ? " 

"You are the first person." 

Why have you been silent ? " 

"Because of your engagement." 

" But you have done your best to keep that up." 

"That 's another matter !" 

"It 's very strange !" said Roderick presently. "It 's 
like something in a novel." 

"We needn 't expatiate on it," said Rowland. "All 
I wished to do was to rebut your charge that I am an 
abnormal being." 

But still Roderick pondered. "All these months, 
while I was going my way ! I wish you had mentioned 
it." 

" I acted as was necessary, and that 's the end of it." 

"You have a very high opinion of her?" 

"The highest." 



 

" I remember now your occasionally expressing it and 
my being struck with it. But I never dreamed you 
were in love with her. It 's a pity she doesn 't care for 
you !" 

Rowland had made his point, and he had no wish to 
prolong the conversation ; but he had a desire to hear 
more of this, and he remained silent. 

"You hope, I suppose, that some day she may?" 
Roderick asked. 

" I shouldn 't have offered to say so ; but since you 
ask me, I do." 

" I don 't believe it. She idolises me, and if she never 
were to see me again she would idolise my memory." 

This might be vivid insight and it might be profound 
fatuity. Rowland turned away ; he could not trust him 
self to speak. 

My indifference, my neglect of her, must have 
seemed to you horrible. Altogether I must have ap
