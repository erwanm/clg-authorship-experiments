IMITATION. 



He gathers up old bones and turns them into manure. 
In California he gets a living out of old mining claims 
that white men have 
abandoned as exhausted and worthless — and then the 
officers come down 
on him once a month 
with an exorbitant 
swindle to which the 
legislature has given 
the broad, general 
name of " foreign " 
mining tax, but it is 
usually inflicted on 
no foreigners but 
Chinamen. This 
swindle has in some 
cases been repeated 

once or twice on the same victim in the course of the same 
month — but the public treasury was not additionally enriched 
by it, probabl3 

Chinamen hold their dead in great reverence — they worship 
their departed ancestors, in fact. Hence, in China, a man's front 
yard, back yard, or any other part of his premises, is made his 
family burying ground, in order that he may visit the graves 
at any and all times. Therefore that huge empire is one 
mighty cemetery ; it is ridged and wringled from its centre ta 
its circumference with graves — and inasmuch as every foot of 
ground must be made to do its utmost, in China, lest the swarm- 
ing population suifer for food, the very graves are cultivated 
and yield a harvest, custom holding this to be no dishonor to 
the dead. Since the departed are held in such worshipful 
reverence, a Chinaman cannot bear that any indignity be 
offered the places where they sleep. Mr. Burlingame said that 
herein lay China's bitter opposition to railroads ; a road 
could not be built anywhere in the empire without distui'bing 
the graves of their ancestors or friends. 


A Chinaman liardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter 
except his body lay in his beloved China ; also, he desires to 
receive, himself, after death, that worship with which he has 
honored his dead that preceded him. Therefore, if he visits a 
foreign country, he makes arrangements to have his bones re- 
turned to China in case he dies ; if he hires to go to a foreign 
country on a labor contract, there is always a stipulation that 
his body shall be taken back to China if he dies ; if the govern- 
ment sells a gang of Coolies to a foreigner for the usual tive- 
jear term, it is specified in the contract that their bodies shall 
be restored to China in case of death. On the Pacific coast 
the Chinamen all belong to one or another of several great 
companies or organizations, and these companies keep track of 
their members, register their names, and ship their bodies home 
when they die. The See Yup Company is held to be the 
largest of these. The Ning Yeong Company is next, and 
numbers eighteen thousand members on the coast. Its head- 
quarters are at San Francisco, where it has a costly temple, 
several great officers (one of whom keeps regal state in seclu- 
sion and cannot be approached by common humanity), and a 
numerous priesthood. In it I was shown a register of its mem- 
bers, with the dead and the date of their shipment to China 
duly marked. Every ship that sails from San Francisco carries 
away a heavy freight of Chinese corpses — or did, at least, until 
the legislature, with an ingenious refinement of Christian 
cruelty, forbade the shipments, as a neat underhanded way of 
deterring Chinese immigration. The bill was offered, whether 
it passed or not. It is my impression that it passed. There 
was another bill — it became a law — compelling every incoming 
Chinaman to be vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly ap- 
pointed quack (no decent doctor would defile himself with 
such legalized robbery) ten dollars for it. As few importers 
of Chinese would want to go to an expense like that, the law- 
makers thought this would be another heavy blow to Chinese 
immigration. 

What the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like — or, indeed, 
what the Chinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is 
like — may be gathered from this item which I printed iu the 
Enterpi'ise while reporting for that paper : 

Chinatown. — Accompanied by a fellow reporter, we made a trip through 
our Chinese quarter the other night. The Chinese have built their portion 
of the city to suit themselves ; and as they keep neither carriages nor 
wagons, their streets are not wide enough, as a general thing, to admit of 
the passage of vehicles. At ten o'clock at night the Chinaman may be seen 
in all his glory. In every little cooped-up, dingy cavern of a hut, faint with 
the odor of burning Josh-lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save 
the sickly, guttering tallow candle, were two or three yellow, long-tailed 
vagabonds, coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed, smoking opium, motion- 
less and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess of satisfaction 
— or rather the recent smoker looks thus, immediately after having passed 
the pipe to his neighbor — for opium-smoking is a comfortless operation, and 
requires constant attention. A lamp sits on the bed, the length of the long 
pipe-stem from the smoker's mouth ; he puts a pellet of opium on the end of 
a wire, sets it on fire, and plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would 
fill a hole with putty ; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds to 
smoke — and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of the 
juices in the stem would wellnigh turn the stomach of a statue. John 
likes it, though ; it soothes him, he takes about two dozen whiffs, and then 
rolls over to dream. Heaven only knows what, for we could not imagine by 
looking at the soggy creature. Possibly in his visions he travels far away 
from the gross world and his regular washing, and feasts on succulent rata 
and birds'-nests in Paradise. 

Mr. Ah Sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at No. 13 Wang 
street. He lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest way. 
He had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies, with un- 
pronouncable names, imported from China in little crockery jugs, and which 
he oflijred to us in dainty little miniature wash-basins of porcelain. He 
offered us a mess of birds'-nests ; also, small, neat sausages, of which we 
could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen to try, but we sus- 
pected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse, and therefore 
refrained. Mr. Sing had in his store a thousand articles of merchandise, 
curious to behold, impossible to imagine the uses of, and beyond our ability 
to describe. 

His ducks, however, and his eggs, we could understand ; the former were 
split open and flattened out like codfish, and came from China in that 
shape, and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which 
kept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage. 

We found Mr. Hong Wo, No. 37 Chow-chow street, making up a lottery 
scheme — in fact we found a dozen others occupied iu the same way in vari- 
ous parts of the quarter, for about every third Chinaman runs a lottery, and 
the balance of the tribe " buck " at it. " Tom," who speaks faultless English, 
and used to be chief and only cook to the Territorial Enterprise, when the 
establishment kept bachelor's hall two years ago, said that " Sometime 
Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap, ketch urn. two tree hundred, sometime 
no ketch um anyting ; lottery like one man fight um seventy — may-be he 
whip, may-be he get whip heself , welly good." However, the percentage 
being sixty-nine against him, the chances are, as a general thing, that "he 

get whip heself." We could not see that these lotteries differed in any
