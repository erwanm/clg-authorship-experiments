XIX. 

LEMUEL had found out about the art-students from 
Berry. He said they were no relation to each other, 
and had not even been acquainted before they met 
at the art-school ; he had first met them at the St. 
Albans. Miss Swan was from the western part of 
the State, and Miss Carver from down Plymouth 
way. The latter took pupils, and sometimes gave 
lessons at their houses ; she was, to Berry 's thinking, 
not half the genius and not half the duck that Miss 
Swan was, though she was a duck in her way too. 
Miss Swan, as nearly as he could explain, was study 
ing art for the fun of it, or the excitement, for she 
was well enough off; her father was a lawyer out 
there, and Berry believed that a rising son-in-law in 
his own profession would be just the thing for the 
old man 's declining years. He said he should not be 
very particular about settling down to practice at 
once; if his wife wanted to go to Europe a while, and 
kind of tender foot it round for a year or two in the 
art-centres over there, he would let the old man run 
the business a little longer ; sometimes it did an old 
man good. There was no hurry ; Berry 's own father 

 



 

was not excited about his going to work right away ; 
he had the money to run Berry and a wife too, if it 
came to that ; Miss Swan understood that. He 
had not told her so in just so many words, but he 
had let her know that Alonzo W. Berry, senior, 
was not borrowing money at two per cent, a month 
any more. He said he did not care to make much 
of a blow about that part of it till he was ready to 
act, and he was not going to act till he had a dead- 
sure thing of it ; he was having a very good time 
as it went along, and he guessed Miss Swan was 
too ; no use to hurry a girl, when she was on the 
right track. 

Berry invented these axioms apparently to put 
himself in heart; in the abstract he was already 
courageous enough. He said that these Eastern 
girls were not used to having any sort of attention ; 
that there was only about a tenth or fifteenth of a 
fellow to every girl, and that it tickled one of them 
to death to have a whole man around. He was not 
meanly exultant at their destitution. He said he 
just wished one of these pretty Boston girls nice, 
well dressed, cultured, and brought up to be snubbed 
and neglected by the tenths and fifteenths of men 
they had at home could be let loose in the West, 
and have a regular round-up of fellows. Or, no, he 
would like to have about five thousand fellows from 
out there, that never expected a woman to look at 
them, unloaded in Boston, and see them open their 
eyes. "Wouldn't one of. em get home alive, if 
kindness could kill em. I never saw such a place ! 



 

I can't gefc used to it ! It makes me tired. Any 
sort of fellow could get married in Boston !" 

Berry made no attempt to reconcile his uncertainty 
as to his own chances with this general theory, but 
he urged it to prove that Miss Swan and Miss Carver 
would like to have Lemuel call; he said they had both 
said they wished they could paint him. He had him 
self sustained various characters in costume for them, 
and one night he pretended that they had sent him 
down for Lemuel to help out with a certain group. 
But they received him with a sort of blankness which 
convinced him that Berry had exceeded his authority ; 
there was a helplessness at first, and then an indignant 
determination to save him from a false position even 
at their own cost, which JLemuel felt rather than saw. 
Miss Carver was foremost in his rescue ; she devoted 
herself to this, and left Miss Swan to punish Berry, 
who conveyed from time to time his sense that he 
fras " getting it," by a wink to Lemuel. 

An observer with more social light might have 
been more puzzled to account for Berry 's toleration 
by these girls, who apparently associated with him 
on equal terms. Since he was not a servant, he was 
their equal in Lemuel 's eyes ; perhaps his acceptance 
might otherwise be explained by the fact that he was 
very amusing, chivalrously harmless, and extremely 
kind-hearted and useful to them. One must 
not leave out of the reckoning his open devotion 
for Miss Swan, which in itself would do 
much to approve him to her, and commend him 
to Miss Carver, if she were a generous girl, and very 



 

fond of her friend. It is certain that they did tole 
rate Berry, who made them laugh even that night 
in spite of themselves, till Miss Swan said, " Well, 
what & the use ? " and stopped trying to discipline 
him. After that they had a very sociable evening, 
though Lemuel kept his distance, and would not let 
them include him, knowing what the two girls really 
thought of him. He would not take part in Berry 's 
buffooneries, but talked soberly and rather austerely 
with Miss Carver; and to show that he did not feel 
himself an inferior, whatever she might think, he was 
very sarcastic about some of the city ways and customs 
they spoke of. There were a good many books about 
novels mostly, but not the kind Statira used to 
read, and poems ; Miss Carver said she liked to take 
them up when she was nervous from her work; and if 
the weather was bad, and she could not get out for a 
walk, a book seemed to do her almost as much good. 
Nearly all the pictures about in the room seemed to 
be Miss Swan 's ; in fact, when Lemuel asked about 
them, and tried to praise them in such a way as not 
to show his ignorance, Miss Carver said she did very 
little in colour ; her lessons were all in black and 
white. He would not let her see that he did not 
know what this was, but he was ashamed, and he 
determined to find out; he determined to get a 
drawing-book, and learn something about it himself. 
To his thinking, the room was pretty harum-scarum. 
There were shawls hung upon the walls, and rugs, 
and pieces of cloth, which sometimes had half-finished 
paintings fastened to them ; there were paintings
