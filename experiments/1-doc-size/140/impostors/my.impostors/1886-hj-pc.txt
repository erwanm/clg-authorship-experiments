dreamed of was at his lips ; it was purple with the wine 
of novelty, of civilisation, and he couldn't push it aside 
without drinking. He might go home ashamed, but he 
would have for evermore in his mouth the taste of nectar. 
He went upstairs, under the eye of the butler, and on his 
way to his room, at the turning of a corridor, found himself 
face to face with Madame Grandoni. She had apparently 
just issued from her own apartment, the door of which stood 
open, near her ; she might have been hovering there in ex- 
pectation of his footstep. She had donned her dressing- 
gown, which appeared to give her every facility for respira- 
tion, but she had not yet parted with her wig. She still 
had her pink French book under her arm ; and her fat 





little hands, tightly locked together in front of her, formed 
the clasp of her generous girdle. 

' Do tell me it is positive, Mr. Robinson ! ' she said, 
stopping short. 

' What is positive, Madame Grandoni ? ' 

'That you take the train in the morning.' 

' I can't tell you that, because it wouldn't be true. On 
the contrary, it has been settled that I shall stay over. I 
am very sorry if it distresses you but che vuole ? ' Hyacinth 
added, smiling. 

Madame Grandoni was a humorous woman, but she 
gave him no smile in return; she only looked at him a 
moment, and then, shrugging her shoulders silently but 
expressively, shuffled back to her room.

' I CAN give you your friend's name in a single guess. He 
is Diedrich Hoffendahl ! ' They had been strolling more 
and more slowly, the next morning, and as she made 
this announcement the Princess stopped altogether, standing 
there under a great beech with her eyes upon Hyacinth's 
and her hands full of primroses. He had breakfasted at 
noon, with his hostess and Madame Grandoni, but the old 
lady had fortunately not joined them when the Princess 
afterwards proposed that he should accompany her on her 
walk in the park. She told him that her venerable friend 
had let her know, while the day was still very young, that 
she thought it in the worst possible taste of the Princess not 
to have allowed Mr. Robinson to depart ; to which Christina 
had replied that concerning tastes there was no disputing 
and that they had disagreed on such matters before without 
any one being the worse. Hyacinth expressed the hope 
that they wouldn't dispute about him of all thankless 
subjects in the world ; and the Princess assured him that 
she never disputed about anything. She held that there 
were other ways than that of arranging one's relations with 
people ; and Hyacinth guessed that she meant that when 
a difference became sharp she broke off altogether. On her 
side, then, there was as little possibility as on his that they 





should ever quarrel ; their acquaintance would be a solid 
friendship or it would be nothing at all. The Princess 
gave it from hour to hour more of this quality, and it may 
be imagined how safe Hyacinth felt by the time he began 
to tell her that something had happened to him, in London, 
three months before, one night (or rather in the small 
hours of the morning), that had altered his life altogether 
had, indeed, as he might say, changed the terms on which 
he held it. He was aware that he didn't know exactly 
what he meant by this last phrase ; but it expressed 
sufficiently well the new feeling that had come over him 
since that interminable, tantalising cab -drive in the 
rain. 

The Princess had led to this, almost as soon as they left 
the house ; making up for her avoidance of such topics the 
day before by saying, suddenly, ' Now tell me what is going 
on among your friends. I don't mean your worldly acquaint- 
ances, but your colleagues, your brothers. On en etes-vous, 
at the present time? Is there anything new, is anything 
going to be done ; I am afraid you are always simply dawdling 
and muddling.' Hyacinth felt as if, of late, he had by no 
means either dawdled or muddled ; but before he had com- 
mitted himself so far as to refute the imputation the Princess 
exclaimed, in another tone, ' How annoying it is that I can't 
ask you anything without giving you the right to say to 
yourself, " After all, what do I know ? May she not be in 
the pay of the police ? " : 

' Oh, that doesn't occur to me,' said Hyacinth, with a 
smile. 

' It might, at all events ; by which I mean it may, at any 
moment. Indeed,! think it ought.' 



 

' If you were in the pay of the police you wouldn't trouble 
your head about me.' 

' I should make you think that, certainly ! That would 
be my first care. However, if you have no tiresome sus- 
picions so much the better,' said the Princess ; and she 
pressed him again for some news from behind the scenes. 

In spite of his absence of doubt on the subject of her 
honesty he felt that he should never again entertain any 
such trumpery idea as that she might be an agent on the 
wrong side he did not open himself immediately ; but at 
the end of half an hour he let her know that the most 
important event of his life had taken place, scarcely more 
than the other day, in the most unexpected manner. And 
to explain in what it had consisted, he said, ' I pledged 
myself, by everything that is sacred.' 

' To what did you pledge yourself? ' 

'I took a vow a tremendous, terrible vow in the 
presence of four witnesses,' Hyacinth went on. 

' And what was it about, your vow ? ' 

' I gave my life away,' said Hyacinth, smiling. 

She looked at him askance, as if to see how he would 
make such an announcement as that ; but she wore no 
smile her face was politely grave. They moved together 
a moment, exchanging a glance, in silence, and then she
