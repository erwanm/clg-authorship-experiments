'‘Why, the matter was settled before that,” said Ger- 
vaise. ‘Tt was because you people did not want to believe 
it. The bargaining had been going on a long time. At 
first the United States would not pay what Bonaparte 
asked.” 

“And the Americans are such petty bargain-makers !” 
cried the scornful girl. “To buy up a country whether 
the people will or no ! To beat down, to give the lowest 
price — why, it is like a slave-dealer!” 

“And they give the whole province such liberty as 
they never had before. They can elect their own officers, 
they can trade where they will. They are a self-govern- 
ing territory except in a few matters, and some day may 
be a splendid State.” 

“vSelf-governing !” The tone was both bitter and in- 
credulous. “Then they send a governor, an American, 





they are forming military companies, they are putting 
their men in the offices as fast as possible ” 

‘‘As if the French wouldn’t have turned out the 
Spaniards fast enough if they had the power. And your 
governor would have come from France.” 

“We should have given him a welcome, Monsieur. 
He would have been of our own people. We are 
French.” 

Politics and religion make bitter quarrels. And these 
young people, the girl knowing nothing about the cir- 
cumstances of the last two years that had brought about 
this culmination, the young fellow, whose soul had been 
broadened by travel and contact with his kind, plunged 
into an unequal warfare. 

“Good-evening, Monsieur,” said Zenobie, loftily, and 
swept across the gallery. 

Gervaise was angry. There were no more idle morn- 
ings or pleasant evenings at the Lavalettes’. 

The mornings indeed were soon devoted to more sub- 
stantial matters. M. de Longpre had found a very 
pleasant and suitable position for the young friend of his 
son, a fine young fellow, he thought. 

And since even the best of girls gossip a little, Hortense 
was not slow in retailing this to Sylvie, and the little girl 
took a malicious sort of pleasure in it. She hoped Ger- 
vaise loved Zenobie extravagantly, for the more he loved, 
the more deeply he would suffer. And now he would 
know ! 

There were two other circumstances occupying her a 
good deal. One was the departure of Cousin Hugh. 
She had grown quite used to him, and somehow, she 
thought him improved in looks. He was not so thin, 
that made a difference. His nose was less prominent, 
and when he smiled — it was a grave sort of smile, but 




had a certain sweetness in it that one could recall so 
easily — it softened all his face. His eyes were dark and 
resolute, she had called them fierce at first, but occasion- 
ally there came a shade of tenderness in them that almost 
won her against herself. 

The other was a very curious interest in Monsieur 
Norton, who might be considered a regular evening 
visitor. Hylas was very glad to come as well. Sylvie 
always upbraided him for not loving her best, and then 
they had a royal romp up and down the old garden. 
Sometimes Angel and M’sieu walked about, for it was 
still very pleasant ; sometimes he read verses to her, 
or made her read to him. Sylvie liked him very much. 
He often brought her bonbons — they had them even then, 
and little girls were fond of them. 

One evening Cousin Hugh took Angel down the 
oleander walk. Sylvie came skipping along. 

‘T have something quite confidential to say to Angel,” 
and he made a little gesture of dismissal. “Then I have 
something for your ear alone that Angel must not hear.” 

“But if it is alike ” 

“Ah, but it isn’t alike,” he interrupted, smiling at 
Sylvie. 

She returned to the court reluctantly. “Telano,” she 
said, sadly, “I wish I had a great secret to tell you. I 
used to have secrets,” and she sighed. 

Hugh fell into step with Angelique. How soft and 
sweet the air was all about them! 

“I think if I can get money enough out of the wreck 
of anything, I shall buy this old place when I come back,” 
he said. “I like it so very much. I like New Orleans, 
and it has a great future before it. And I feel that I, 
too, am pervaded with what Gervaise calls patriotism.” 




Angel laughed softly. “We shall be French- Ameri- 
cans,” she said. 

“You do not want to go back to the mother country?” 

“Oh, no, no,” earnestly. 

“I am glad to hear you say so. While I am gone I want 
to leave Sylvie in your care. She really ought to have 
some regular education. It is what the province lacks. 
If some one could be found — I like many things in the 
Eastern system. But I must say, Angel, I think you 
unusually intelligent.” 

“Oh, thank you,” she gave a soft little laugh. 

“This was not my secret, however. Angel, as head of 
the family I have been asked to sanction a young man’s 
visits and addresses, and consent to a betrothal. I like 
him very much. But it is for you decide, my dear 
cousin. He will ask his own question. He is not rich, 
though he may be in a few years. I like the fashion 
of two people making an election. My dear Angel, I 
hope you will be very happy.”
