Hylas might indulge in his overjoy without disturbing 
any one. Delicacy as well, for there were some family 
mysteries, that was evident. 

Hugh unrolled the parchment and began to read. A 
frown settled across his brow. What sort of madness 
must have seized upon his mother ! 

“Gervaise!” There was a sharpness in his tone that 
struck even himself. “I cannot understand,” he said. 
“Was it persecution that sent you here? I supposed it 
was the frightful disorder of the times. And how could 
this be allowed?” 

“The Marquise insisted. She was very ill, you know. 
And we were all young then ” 

“Yes,” said Barbe. “But she thought she was follow- 
ing out your wishes and providing for the safety and 
future welfare of the child. I do not think she ever read 
all that contract. It was done so hurriedly. And that 
very night we fled. My husband had heard some whis- 
pers that she, that my darling would be taken from us, 
from me.” 

“This is Sylvie Perrier! Why she is only a child 
now !” He advanced a step nearer. “And then Ange- 
lique was only a little girl.” 

It was coming to him by degrees. There was all the 
fortune. That had tempted his mother. But then in 
France marriages were generally arranged by the parents. 




“And you took my place, Gervaise? You answered 
for me. Oh, you could not quite understand what you 
were doing. Yet it saved her, or you all saved her from 
falling into the wrong hands. But to have a husband 
thrust upon one in childhood ” 

“Let us get to the bottom of the matter. I did your 
mother’s bidding,’’ said Gervaise. “We have never been 

able, or thought it wise, to explain to Sylvie, but now ’’ 

He turned scarlet. It was hard to establish his own free- 
dom. 

Sylvie raised her head and was looking at both intently. 
Some strange awakening stirred within her. Then she 
crossed to Gervaise, put her hand in his. 

“I shall soon be twelve,’’ she began, with dignity. 
“And then Barbe said ” 

“Listen, dear.’’ His voice softened to tenderness. He 
possessed the true savoir faire of his nation. “The Mar- 
quise had loved your mother dearly. She loved you, a 
little child. There were troublous times for little girls 
who were heiresses. So she thought Hugh could care for 
you and yours better than any one else, only you must be 
his wife. Perhaps she knew more than any one else, 
more than she confessed. We were so young and inex- 
perienced. Otherwise you would have been bundled into 
the convent, perhaps Barbe sent away from you. And 
so I stood in Hugh’s stead and married you for him ’’ 

Hugh de Brienne looked at his young cousin with a 
kind of softening gratitude. Fie had told the story from 
the most attractive side. Even if the Marquise had cared 
for the estates, manv a French mother before her had 
made a good marriage for her son. And Sylvie might 
have been a prey to more than one party, he saw. His 
eyes had appreciation in them, approval. 

Sylvie dropped Gervaise’s hand. She stood a little 




apart, her very tallest, but she was not large of her age. 
Her blue eyes hardened to steely gleams, her rosebud 
mouth took on severe lines like a woman in indignation. 
Her slim figure seemed to swell and throb. 

“And you did not love me !” she cried in piercing 
pathos. “You did not want me for your little wife ! 
You will marry Hortense, or perhaps Zenobie — Zenobie 
who laughs at Telano and torments me whenever I see 
her. You married me to this — this ugly old man !” she 
could not think of anything worse to say, for his faults 
and virtues were alike unknown to her. And truly Hugh 
de Brienne did not look young for his years, which were 
nearing thirty. Hardships and fighting Indians had told 
upon him. “And now,” she continued, “I shall never 
love you any more. I shall hate you both. I ” 

Suddenly she flew to Barbe and sank in her arms, 
weeping hysterically. 

“It is very hard,” confessed Gervaise, whose lips were all 
of a quiver, “but, you see, the truth had to be told, and there 
is no better time than now. But we have hardly given you 
a word of welcome, cousin Hugh. And sometime Sylvie 
will realize what you have snatched her from. Oh, we are 
so thankful to have you alive ! But where is M’sieu Nor- 
ton? We owe him a debt. I traced you about Detroit 
and then lost sight of you ” 

“I was carried down into Ohio by some friends. I had 
a hard time getting really well. Afterward I met Boone, 
and John Sevier, and others — there were so many plans 
on foot.” 

He looked sharply at Gervaise, who nodded. 

Hugh drew a long breath. “It is a wonderful 
country,” he exclaimed. “It would be grand if it were 
all united from ocean to ocean, a dream larger than that 
of this Corsican who shapes the destinies of France. For 




where a place is divided up in petty governments there 
will always be friction and disputes. Let me see that 
marriage contract again.” 

Gervaise handed it to him from the rustic stand where 
it had been laid. 

He perused it attentively. '‘I do not believe my mother 
was aware of its contents. The De Chatillys have been 
Huguenots from early times. There were Catholics at 
Saint Morne, I think. Well — we must do what is best 

for the child. Little Sylvie ” and Hugh approached
