run into weeks, the strength and nervous energy 
of them both began at times to fail. Neither shewed 
it to the other, except as pale faces and weary eyes 
told their story. Mrs. Copley cried in secret, at 
night, with her head on the window-sill; and Dol- 
ly went with slow foot to gather her herbs and 
vegetables, and sat down sometimes in the porch, 
in the early dawn or the evening gloom, and al- 
lowed herself to own that things were looking very 
dark indeed. The question was, how long would 
it be possible to go on as they were doing ? how 
long would strength hold out? and money? The 
doctor's fees took great pinches out of Dolly's fund ; 
a^nd for the present there was no adding to it. Lady 
Brierley was away; she had gone to the seaside. 
Mrs. Jersey was very kind; fruit and eggs and 
vegetables came almost daily from the House to 



 

Dolly's help, and the kind housekeeper herself had 
offered to sit up with the sick man ; but this offer 
was refused. Mr. Copley did not like to see any 
stranger about him. And Dolly and her mother 
were becoming now very tired. As the weeks went 
on, they ceased to look in each other's faces any 
more with questioning eyes ; they knew too well how 
anxiety and effort had told upon both of them, and 
each was too conscious of what the other was thinking and fearing. They did not meet each other's 
eyes with those mute demands in them any more; 
but they stole stealthy glances sometimes each to 
see how the other face looked; what tokens of wear 
and tear it was shewing; taking in at a rapid view 
the lines of weariness, the marks of anxiety, the 
faded colour, the languor of spirit which had gradually taken the place of the earlier energy. In 
word and action they shewed none of all this. All 
the more, no doubt, when each was alone and the 
guard might be relaxed, a very grave and sorrowful expression took possession of their faces. Nothing else might be relaxed. Day and night the labour and the watch were unintermitting. 

And so the summer wore on to an end. Dolly 
was patient, but growing very sad; perhaps taking 
a wider view of things than her mother, who for 
the present was swallowed up in the one care about 
her husband's condition. Dolly, managing the finances and managing the household, had both parents to think of; and was sometimes almost in 
despair. 



 

She was sitting so one afternoon in the kitchen, 
in a little lull of work before it was time to get 
supper, looking out into the summer glow. It was 
warm in the small kitchen, but Dolly had not energy to go somewhere else for coolness. She sat 
gazing out, and almost querying whether all things 
were coming to an end at once ; life and the means 
to live together, and the strength to get means. 
And yet she remembered that it is written "Trust 
in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in 
the land, and verily thou shalt be fed" But then, it 
came cold into her heart, it could not be said that 
her father and mother had ever fulfilled those con- 
ditions; could the promise be good for her faith 
alone? And truly, where was Dolly's faith just 
now ? Withal, as she sat gazing out of the window, she saw that full wealth of summer, which 
was a pledge and proof of the riches of the hand 
from which it came. 

" There's a gentleman, mum," Dolly's little help- 
mate announced in her ear. Dolly started. 

"A gentleman? what gentleman? It isn't the 
doctor ? He has been here." 

"It's no him. I knows Dr. Hopley. It's no 
him." 

" I cannot see company. Is it company, Nelly?" 

"The gentleman didn't say, mum." 

" Where is he ? " 

" He's a standin' there at the door." 

Dolly slowly rose up and doubtfully took off her 
great kitchen apron; doubtfully went up stairs. 



 

Perhaps she had better see who it was. Mrs. 
Jersey might have sent a messenger, or Lady 
Brierley ! She went on to the hall door, which 
was open, and where indeed she saw a tall figure 
against the summer glow which filled all out of 
doors. A tall figure, a tall upright figure ; at first 
Dolly could see only the silhouette of him against 
the warm outer light. She came doubtfully close 
up to the open door. Then she could see a little 
more besides the tallness; a peculiar uprightness 
of bearing, a manly, frank face, a head of close 
curling dark hair, and an expression of pleasant 
expectation; there was a half smile on the face, 
and a deferential look of waiting. He stood bare-headed before her, and had not the air of a stranger; but Dolly was quite bewildered. Somebody 
altogether strange, and yet somehow familiar. She 
said nothing; her eyes questioned why, being a 
stranger, he should stand there with such a look 
upon his face. 

" I am afraid I am not remembered," said the 
gentleman, with the smile coming out a little 
more. His look too was steady and straight forward and observant, where had Dolly seen that 
mixture of quietness and resoluteness ? Her eyes 
fell to the little cap in his hand, an officer's cap, 
and then light came into them. 

Oh ! " she cried," Mr. Shubrick ! " 
" It is a long time since that Christmas day at 
Home," he said; a more wistful gravity coming 
into his face as he better scanned the face opposite 



 

to him, which the evening light revealed very 
fully. 

"I know now," said Dolly. " I do not need 
to be reminded; but I could not expect to see you 
here. I thought you were in the Mediterranean. 
Will you come in, Mr. Shubrick ? I am very glad 
to see you; but my thoughts were so far away " 

" You thought I was in the Mediterranean ? " he 
said as he followed Dolly in. " May I ask, why ? "
