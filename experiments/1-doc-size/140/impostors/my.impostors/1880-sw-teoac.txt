subdued frame of mind. 

" I don't see what your father wanted of a consulship, or anything else that would take him out 
of his country ! " Mr. Eberstein uttered his rather 
grumbling complaint. " He has enough to satisfy 
a man without that." 

"But what papa likes is precisely something to 
take him out of the country. He likes change " 
said Dolly sorrowfully. 

" He won't have much change as American consul in London," Mr. Eberstein returned. " Business 
will pin him pretty close." 

"I suppose it will be a change at first," said 



 

Dolly; "and then, when he gets tired of it, he will 
give it up and take something else." 

"And you, little Dolly, you are accordingly to 
be shoved out into the great, great world, long before you are ready for it." 

" Is the world any bigger over there than it is 
on this side ? " said Dolly, with a gleam of fun. 

" Well, yes," said Mr. Eberstein. " Most people 
think so. And London is a good deal bigger than 
Philadelphia." 

"The world is very much alike all over," remarked Mrs. Eberstein; "in one place a little 
more fascinating and dangerous, in another a little less." 

" Will it be more or less, over there, for me, 
Aunt Harry ? " 

" It would be ' more ' for you anywhere, Dolly, 
soon. Why you are between sixteen and seventeen ; almost a woman ! " Mrs. Eberstein said with 



"No, not yet, Aunt Harry. I'll be a girl yet 
awhile. I can be that in England, can't I, as well 
as here ? " 

"Better," said Mr. Eberstein. 

"But the world, nevertheless, is a little bigger 
out there, Ned," his wife added. 

"In what way, Aunt Harry? And what do you 
mean by ' the world ' anyhow ? " 

" I mean what the Lord was speaking of, when 
he said to his disciples, ' If ye were of the world, 
the world would love his own ; but because ye are 



 

not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the 
world, therefore the world hateth you.' " 

" That means, bad people ? " 

"Some of them are by no means bad people. 
Some of them are delightful people." 

" Then I do not quite understand, Aunt Harry. 
I thought it meant not only bad people, but gay 
people; pleasure lovers." 

"Aren't you a lover of pleasure, Dolly ? " 

" yes. But Aunt Harry," Dolly said seriously, 
" I am not a ' lover of pleasures more than a lover 
of God.'" 

" No ; thanks to his goodness ! However, Dolly, 
people may be just as worldly without seeking 
pleasures at all. It isn't that." 

" What is it, then ? " 

" I don't know how to put it. Ned, can you ? " 

"Why Hal," said Mr. Eberstein pondering, "it 
comes to about this, I reckon. There are just two 
kingdoms in the world; upon earth I mean." 

"Yes. Well? I know there are two kingdoms, 
and no neutral ground. But what is the dividing 
line? That is what we want to know." 

" If there is no neutral ground, it follows, that 
the border line of one kingdom is the border line 
of the other. To go out of one, is to go into the 
other." 

"Well? Yes. That's plain." 

"Then it is simple enough. What belongs to 
Christ, or what is done for him or in his service, 
belongs to his kingdom. Of course, what is not 



 

Christ's, nor is done for him, nor in his service, be- 
longs to the world." 

There was a silence here of some duration ; and 
then Dolly exclaimed, "I see it. I shall know 
now." 

"What, Dolly?" 

"How to do, Aunt Harry." 

" How to do what ? " 

" Everything. I was thinking particularly just 
then ;| Dolly hesitated. 

" Yes, of what ? " 

" Of dressing myself." 

" Dressing yourself, you chicken ? " 

" Yes, Aunt Harry. I see it. If I do not dress 
for Christ, I do it for the world." 

"Don't go into another extreme now, Dolly."
