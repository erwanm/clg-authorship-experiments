Eleanor's hands left her face and fell together upon 
Gilbert's right. 

" I have not mine to give," she answered in a low 



 

voice. " It is yours already — and I would that you 
were not English, that I might be your sovereign 
and make you great among men — or that I were 
England's Queen — and that may come to pass, and 
you shall see what I will do for love of you — I 
would marry that boy of the Plantagenets, if it 
could serve you ! " 

"Madam," said Gilbert, "think of your own 
present safety — the King is very angry — " 

" Did I think of your safety when I sent you out 
to lead us? Now if you are here, am I not safe? 
Gilbert — " 

She let her voice caress his name, and her lips 
lingered with it, and she laid her hands upon his 
shoulders. As he knelt beside her — she bent to his 
face. 

" Best and bravest living man " — it was a whisper 
now — " love of my life — heart of my heart — this 
last time — this only once — and then good-by." 

She kissed him on the forehead, and leapt from 
her seat in horror, for there was another voice in the 
room, with a hurt cry. 

"Oh, Gilbert! Gilbert!" 

Beatrix was reeling on her feet, and caught the 
curtain, lest she fall, and her face of agony was still 
turned toward the two, as they stood together. Gil- 
bert sprang forward, when he understood, and caught 
the girl in his arms and brought her to the light, 
trembling like a falling leaf. Then she started in 
his arms and struggled wildly to be free, and twisted 
her neck lest he should kiss her; but he held her 
fast. 





" Beatrix ! You do not understand — you did not 
hear ! " He tried to make her listen to Mm. 

"I heard ! " she cried, still struggling. "I saw ! I 
know ! Let me go — oh, for God's sake, let me go ! " 

Gilbert's arms relaxed, and she sprang back from 
him two paces, and faced the Queen. 

" You have won ! " she cried, in a breaking Toice. 
" You have him body and soul, as you swore you 
would ! But do not say that I have not understood ! " 

" I have given him to you, soul and body," answered 
Eleanor, sadly. " Might I not even bid him good-by, 
as a friend might? " 

"You are false — falser each than the other," 
answered Beatrix, in white anger. " You have played 
with me, tricked me, made me your toy — " 

" Did you hear this man say that he did not love 
me, before I bade him good-by?" asked Eleanor, 
gravely, almost sternly. 

" He has said it to me, but not to you, never to you 
— never to the woman he loves ! " 

"I never loved the Queen," said Gilbert. "On 
my soul — on the Holy Cross — " 

" Never loved her ? And you saved her life before 
mine — " 

" And you said that I did well — " 

" It was all a lie — a cruel lie — " The girl's voice 
almost broke, but she choked down the terrible tears, 
and got words again. " It would have been braver 
to have told me long ago — I should not have died 
then, for I loved you less." 

Eleanor came a step nearer and spoke very quietly 
and kindly. 



 

"You are wrong," she said. " Sir Gilbert is sent 
by tbe King to take me as a prisoner, that I may be 
carried away to Jerusalem this very night. Come, 
you shall hear the voices of the soldiers who are 
waiting for me." 

She led Beatrix to the door and lifted the curtain, 
so that through the wooden panels the girl could hear 
the talking of many voices, and the clank of steel. 
Then Eleanor brought her back. 

" But he would not take me," she said, " and he 
warned me of my danger." 

" No wonder — he loves you ! " 

" He does not love me, though I love him, and he 
has said so to-night. And I know that he loves you 
and is faithful to you — " 

Beatrix laughed wildly. 

" Faithful ! He ? There is no faith in his greatest 
oath, nor in his smallest word ! " 

" You are mad, child ; he never lied in all his life 
to me or you — he could not lie." 

" Then he has deceived you, too — Queen, Duchess ; 
you are only a woman, after all, and he has made 
sport of you, as he has of me ! " Again she laughed, 
half furiously. 

"If he has deceived me he has indeed deceived 
you," answered Eleanor, "for he has told me very 
plainly that he loves you. And now I will not stand 
between you and him, even in the mistake you made.
