give, but she doesn’t overburden you. Why 
that smile? ” 

A peculiar bright light had crossed Leslie’s 
face like a half-hidden sunbeam peering out. 

“ Some one says it is a duty to let others 
do to us as we would do if the occasions were 
reversed. But we ought to be quite certain 
we would do it, I suppose. And nothing 
comes nearer to putting me out of temper than 
to have a friend — no, I will say a person — 
often remarking, ‘ Oh, I should so delight to 
do this or that for you ! ’ some great thing, 
when they do not even offer you a small favor 
within their means. I had a schoolmate once 
who would now and then buy me a box of 


 

chocolate bonbons, of which she was extrava- 
gantly fond. I despised chocolate, and she in- 
variably said, ‘Oh! I forgot — you don’t 
love chocolate ! ’ Then she devoured them 
herself.” 

Helen laughed heartily ; then after some 
consideration, she said : 

“ I think your advice is good. But I do 
not want any real intimacy with the child, for 
she seems that to me.” 

“Ask her to the library some evening; I 
should like to meet her, and it isn’t quite like 
inviting her to your room.” 

“ Yes, I wish you to see her. I don't know 
how much of a judge of character I am, but 
she impressed me as being rather frivolous 
and fond of dress, chains, and beads, and all 
that.” 

Leslie was reading the inscription over. 
The book itself was certainly very beautiful. 

“ Helen,” she began, presently, “ have you 
heard from Lorraine? Oh, you needn’t fear 
that I shall be jealous, even though my friend- 
ship does date farther back! I’m pleased when 
the right kind of people like Lorraine, and I 



do not think exclusive intimacies beneficial for 
college girls. They are so apt to measure 
others by their own standard and get unjustly 
critical.” 

“ No. I was thinking perhaps you had 
heard. Is she not generally pretty prompt 
about returning?” 

“ Why, yes — she seldom stays away for 
pure pleasure.” 

“ I thought her rather languid that last 
week or two.” 

“ Oh, I hope she isn’t ill ! ” 

Helen was rather startled at that. 

They heard from her a few days later, and 
the president was notified. There was a 
scratchy little note in a very shaky hand. 
Christmas had been delightful, but for several 
days she had been feeling ill and forlorn, and 
now a fever had set in, but she was quite sure 
to be back at the end of the month, and felt 
awfully disappointed. 

Helen wrote her note to Miss Chardavoyne, 
and said very frankly that she could not re- 
turn in kind, and that she must not shower 
such splendid favors upon her in the future; 


 

also, would she not like to come into the li- 
brary after chapel and meet some of the jun- 
iors and seniors ? Thursday evening would be 
convenient for her. 

She was sauntering out for exercise hour, 
thinking which of the group of girls she should 
approach, when two arms were flung about 
her and a voice cried joyously: 

“Oh, you dear! I've been watching for 
you. I was just dying to see you. Your note 
was charming. It is so lovely of you to chap- 
erone me in the library. I'm scared half to 
death when I go in and don’t know a soul.” 

The face turned upon her was brilliant with 
eager lights, and Helen could not help smiling. 

“ But you were naughty about the book. 
Do you suppose I thought of any return? I 
had just a splendid time in New York with 
a friend, and we went to theatres and two 
operas. Don’t the people dress beautifully? 
And such diamonds ! And so many nice young 
men! There were two girls fairly besieged 
with them ! And one, Mr. Bradford, chose 
the book for me. It was the prettiest edition.” 

“ It is really splendid ! I did not know you 



were a poet. And you had the art to make 
an acrostic really charming.” 

” Oh, I used to write verses at home! I 
did get so tired of always reading them. 
Mamma is generally poring over the old Eng- 
lish poets and Latin translations. She thinks 
there are no great modern poets, though she 
fancies the Rossettis somewhat. And I like so 
many of them. I just used to sit and steep 
myself in the atmosphere, the poetical aura. 
But I couldn’t write about nothing. I want 
some one , a personality, to inspire me.” 

Miss Chardavoyne had talked in a rapid 
breath, and now she had to pause for inspira-
