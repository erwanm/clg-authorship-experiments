me," he thought. "There is very little kindred between a Cuban and
an American."

"Would monsieur like to see M. Novarro?"

"I may as well see him," thought Ben, and he answered in the
affirmative.

"There is M. Novarro, now," said the landlord's son; and Ben,
turning, saw a tall, very dark-complexioned man, who had just
entered.

"M. Novarro, here is a young gentleman who wishes to see you--a
countryman of yours."

The Cuban regarded Ben attentively, and not without surprise.

"Have we met before?" he asked, courteously.

"No, sir," answered Ben, relieved to find that the Cuban spoke
English; "and I am afraid I am taking a liberty in asking for you."

"By no means! If I can be of any service to you, my friend, you may
command me."

"It is rather a long story, Mr. Novarro," Ben commenced.

"Then we will adjourn to my room, where we shall be more at our
ease."

Ben followed his new acquaintance to a handsome private parlor on
the second floor and seated himself in a comfortable arm-chair,
indicated by the Cuban.

"I will first mention my name," said Ben. "It is Benjamin Baker."

"Baker!" exclaimed the Cuban, in evident excitement. "Who was your
father?"

"My father was Dr. John Baker, and lived in Sunderland, Connecticut."

"Is is possible!" ejaculated the Cuban; "you are his son?"

"Did you know my father?" asked Ben, in amazement.

"I never saw him, but I knew of him. I am prepared to be a friend
to his son. Now tell me your story."




                          CHAPTER XXXIII.

                     AN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY.


Ben told his story so far as it concerned his engagement by Major
Grafton and his visit to Europe. Of his mother and her circumstances
and of his uncle he had scarcely occasion to speak, considering
that his auditor would hardly feel interested in his own personal
history. The Cuban, who had a grave, kindly aspect, listened with
close attention to his narrative. When Ben ceased speaking he said:

"My young friend, there is one thing that puzzles me in this story
of yours."

"What is it, sir?" asked Ben, anxiously. He feared that the stranger
did not believe him.

"Why should you need to travel with Major Grafton, or any other
gentleman, as private secretary, unless, indeed, your mother did not
wish you to come to Europe alone?"

Ben stared at his interlocutor in amazement.

"How could I come to Europe alone?" he asked. "Where should I find
the money to pay my expenses?"

"Your mother might pay the expenses of your trip."

"My mother is very poor, Mr. Novarro."

"Very poor! Has she, then, lost the money that your father left her?"

"I think you must be under a great mistake, Mr. Novarro. My uncle
allows my mother a small income, and I help her all I can."

"There is certainly a great mistake somewhere," said the Cuban.
"To my certain knowledge your father possessed a hundred thousand
dollars in first-class securities. Didn't you know anything of
this?" continued Mr. Novarro, observing Ben's look of extreme
amazement.

"I know nothing of it, Mr. Novarro."

"Then he must have been robbed of the securities which I myself
gave him on the 18th day of May, in the year 18--"

"That was the day of my father's death," said Ben.

"He died on that very day?" said the Cuban in excitement. "Tell me
the particulars of your father's death. Did he die a natural death?"

"Yes, sir; he died of heart disease."

"And where?"

"In the house of my Uncle Nicholas."

"Before he had time to go home? Before he had acquainted your mother
with his good fortune?"

"Neither my mother nor myself knew but that he died a poor man."

"But he had the securities with him. Did your uncle say nothing of
them?"

"Not a word."

A look of suspicion appeared on the face of Filippo Novarro.

"Tell me," he said, quickly--"did your uncle, shortly after your
father's death, enlarge his business?"

"Yes, sir; he moved from a small store in Grand street to a larger
store on Broadway--the one which he now occupies."

With the Cuban, suspicion was now changed to certainty.

He brought down his fist heavily upon the table at his side.

"I know all now," he said. "Your uncle deliberately robbed your dead
father of the securities which I had placed in his hands, and coolly
appropriating them to his own use, used the proceeds to build up and
extend his business, leaving your mother to live in poverty."

"I feel bewildered," said Ben. "I can hardly believe my uncle would
treat us so shamefully."

"By the way, when did your mother move to Minnesota?" asked the
