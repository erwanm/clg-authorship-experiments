A week later when the curtain fell on the second act of the new musical
comedy, "The Inca," critics preparing to leave questioned each other
with considerable curiosity concerning this newcomer, Dorothy Wilming,
who had sung so intelligently and made so much out of a subordinate
part.

Nobody seemed to know very much about her; several nice-looking young
girls and exceedingly respectable young men sent her flowers. Afterward
they gathered at the stage entrance, evidently expecting to meet and
congratulate her; but she had slipped away. And while they hunted high
and low, and the last figurante had trotted off under the lamp-lights,
Dolly lay in her own dark room, face among the pillows, sobbing her
heart out for a dead man who had been kind to her for nothing.

And, at the same hour, across an ocean, another woman awoke to take up
the ravelled threadings of her life again and, through another day,
remember Louis Malcourt and all that he had left undone for kindness'
sake.

There were others, too, who were not likely to forget him, particularly
those who had received, with some astonishment, a legacy apiece of one
small Chinese gilded idol--images all of the Pa-hsien or of
Kwan-Yin, who rescues souls from hell with the mystic lotus-prayer,
"Om mane padme hum."

But the true Catholicism, which perplexed the eighteen legatees lay in
the paradox of the Mohammedan inscriptions across each lotus written in
Malcourt's hand:

"I direct my face unto Him who hath created.

"Who maketh His messengers with two and three and four pairs of wings.

"And thou shall see them going in procession.

"This is what ye are promised: 'For the last hour will surely come;
there is no doubt thereof; but the greater part of men believe it not.'

"Thus, facing the stars, I go out among them into darkness.

"Say not for me the Sobhat with the ninety-nine; for the hundredth pearl
is the Iman--pearl beyond praise, pearl of the five-score names in
one, more precious than mercy, more priceless than compassion--Iman!
Iman! thy splendid name is Death!"

So lingered the living memory of Malcourt among men--a little
while--longer among women--then faded as shadows die at dusk when the
mala is told for the soul that waits the Rosary of a Thousand Beads.

In January the Ariani sailed with her owner aboard; but Hamil was not
with him.

In February Constance Palliser wrote Hamil from Palm Beach:

   "It is too beautiful here and you must come.

   "As for Shiela, I do not even pretend to understand her. I see
   her every day; to-day I lunched with Mrs. Cardross, and Shiela
   was there, apparently perfectly well and entirely her former
   lovely self. Yet she has never yet spoken of you to me; and, I
   learn from Mrs. Cardross, never to anybody as far as she knows.

   "She seems to be in splendid health; I have seen her swimming,
   galloping, playing tennis madly. The usual swarm of devoted youth
   and smitten middle-age is in attendance. She wears neither black
   nor colours; only white; nor does she go to any sort of
   functions. At times, to me, she resembles a scarcely grown girl
   just freed from school and playing hard every minute with every
   atom of heart and soul in her play.

   "Gray has an apology for a polo field and a string of ponies, and
   Shiela plays with the men--a crazy, reckless, headlong game, in
   which every minute my heart is in my mouth for fear somebody will
   cannon into her, or some dreadful swing of a mallet will injure
   her for life.

   "But everybody is so sweet to her--and it is delightful to see
   her with her own family--their pride and tenderness for her, and
   her devotion to them.

   "Mrs. Cardross asked me to-day what I thought might be the effect
   on Shiela if you came. And, dear, I could not answer. Mr.
   Cardross joined us, divining the subject of our furtive confab in
   the patio, and he seemed to think that you ought to come.

   "There is no reason to hesitate in saying that the family would
   be very glad to count you as one of them. Even a little snob like
   myself can see that there is, in this desire of theirs, no motive
   except affection for you and for Shiela; and, in a way, it's
   rather humiliating to recognise that they don't care a fig for
   the social advantage that must, automatically, accrue to the
   House of Cardross through such connections.

   "I never thought that I should so earnestly hope for such an
   alliance for you; but I do, Garry. They are such simple folk with
   all their riches--simple as gentle folk--kind, sincere, utterly
   without self-consciousness, untainted by the sordid social
   ambitions which make so many of the wealthy abhorrent. There is
   no pretence about them, nothing of that uncertainty of self
   mingled with vanity which grows into arrogance or servility as
   the social weather-vane veers with the breeze of fashion. Rather
   flowery that, for an old-fashioned spinster.

   "But, dear, there are other flowers than those of speech eloquent
   in the soft Southern air--flowers everywhere outside my open
   window where I sit writing you.

   "I miss Virginia, but Shiela compensates when she can find time
   from her breathless pleasure chase to give me an hour or two at
   tea-time.

   "And Cecile, too, is very charming, and I know she likes me. Such
   a coquette! She has her own court among the younger set; and from
   her very severe treatment of young Gatewood on all occasions I
   fancy she may be kinder to him one day.

   "Mrs. Carrick is not here this winter, her new baby keeping her
   in town; and Acton, of course, is only too happy to remain with
   her.

   "As for Gray, he is a nice boy--a little slow, a trifle shy and
   retiring and over-studious; but his devotion to Shiela makes me
   love him. And he, too, ventured to ask me whether you were not
   coming down this winter to hunt along the Everglades with him and
   Little Tiger.

   "So, dear, I think perhaps you had better come. It really
   frightens me to give you this advice. I could not endure it if
   anything went wrong--if your coming proved premature.

   "For it is true, Garry, that I love our little Shiela with all my
   aged, priggish, and prejudiced heart, and I should simply expire
   if your happiness, which is bound up in her, were threatened by
