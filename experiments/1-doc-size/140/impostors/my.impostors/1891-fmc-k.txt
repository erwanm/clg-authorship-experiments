'Take this man, then,' said the cripple, 'and uncover his face, and hold
him fast. Then let one of us get the razor and shave off all his beard
and his eyebrows, and the hair of his head even to the nape of his neck.
Then if he came suddenly before her who bore him and cried, "Mother,"
she would cover her face and answer, "Begone, thou ostrich's egg!" For
she would not know him. And to-morrow we will take his excellent clothes
from him and put them upon our Sheikh. But we will dress Abdullah in
rags such as would not serve to wipe the mud from a slave's shoes in the
time of the subsiding waters, and we will tie his hands under his
arm-pits and put a halter over his head and lead him about the city.
Then he will cry out against us to the people, saying that he is
Abdullah, but we will also cry out in answer: "See this madman, who
believes himself to be a sheikh of Bedouins though Allah has given him
no beard! O people of Riad, you may know that the spring is come, by the
braying of this ass."'

'Yet I see now that there may be wisdom in brayings,' said the Sheikh of
the beggars, 'though Balaam ibn Beor shut his ears against it, and was
punished for his cursing so that his tongue hung down to his breast, all
his days, like that of a thirsty dog. This is good counsel, for in this
way we shall not shed the man's blood, nor render ourselves guilty of
his death; but I think we shall earn a great reward from Khaled, and his
kingdom will be saved in laughter.'

During all this time Abdullah had not moved, knowing that he was in the
power of many enemies and beyond all reach of help, but when he heard
the decision of the Sheikh of the beggars he was filled with shame and
rolled himself from side to side upon the floor, as though trying to
escape from the bonds that held him. Almasta, for her part, lay quietly
where they had put her, for she saw that all chance of success was gone
and was pondering how she might take advantage of what happened, to save
herself.

Then the beggars laid hold of Abdullah and held him, while others took
the sack from his head. He was indeed half smothered with dust, so that
at first he could not speak aloud, but coughed and sneezed like a dog
that has thrust its nose into a dust-heap to find the bone which is
hidden underneath. But presently he recovered his breath and began to
rail at them and curse them. To this they paid no attention, but brought
the oil lamp near him, and one began to rub soap upon his face and head
while another got the razor with which the beggars shaved their heads
and began to whet it upon his leathern girdle.

'Do not waste the precious stones of your eloquence upon a barber,'
said the Sheikh of the beggars, 'but reserve your breath and the rich
treasures of your speech until you are brought as a plucked bird before
the people of Riad. Moreover we only wish to shave off your beard, but
if you are restless some of your hide will certainly be removed also,
whereby you will be hurt and it will be still harder for your friends to
recognise you to-morrow. It is also useless to shout and scream as
though you were driving camels, for you are in the cellar of my house
which is at a good distance from other habitations, on the borders of
the city.'

So Abdullah saw that there was no escape, and that his fate was about
his neck, and he sat still as they had placed him, while the one-eyed
hunchback shaved off his beard and the hair on his upper lip and his
eyebrows, and the lock at the back of his head.

When this was done the blind man put out his hand and felt Abdullah's
face.

'Surely,' he said, 'this is not a man's head, but the round end of a
walking-staff, rubbed smooth by much use.'

They also tied his hands under his arm-pits and put upon him a ragged
shirt with sleeves so that he seemed to have lost both arms at the
elbow.

'This is very well done,' said the hunchback turning his head from side
to side in order to see all with his one eye. 'But what shall we do
with the woman? Let us cast lots for her, and he who wins her shall
marry her, and we will hold the feast immediately, for we have not yet
supped and there is some of the camel's meat which we received to-day at
the palace.'

'O my brothers,' answered the Sheikh of the beggars, 'let us do nothing
unlawful in our haste. For this woman is certainly one of Abdullah's
wives, as you may see by her clothes, and unless he divorces her none of
us can take her for ourselves, seeing that she is the wife of a
believer. Take the sack from her head, however, and if she deafens us
with her screaming we can put it on again. But you must by no means put
her to shame by taking the veil from her face, for she may be an honest
wife, though her husband be a dog. If she has done well, we shall find
it out, and no harm will have come to her; but if she is a sharer in
this fellow's plans, her punishment will be grievous, since she will be
the wife of an outcast, having neither beard nor eyebrows and rejected
by all men.'

Some of the beggars murmured at this, but most of them praised their
Sheikh's wisdom, and would indeed have feared greatly to break the holy
law, being chiefly devout men who prayed daily in the mosque and
listened to the Khotbah on Friday. They therefore placed Almasta in one
corner of the cellar and Abdullah in another, so that the two could not
converse together, and then they took out such food as they had and
began to eat their supper, laughing and talking over the jest and
anticipating the reward which awaited them for saving Khaled.

In the meanwhile the night was advancing and many of Abdullah's friends
left their houses secretly and gathered in the neighbourhood of the
palace to wait for the first signal from within. By threes and by twos
and singly they came out of their dwellings, looking to the right and
left to see whether they were not the first, as men do who are not sure
of being in the right. All had their swords with them, and some their
bows also, and some few carried their spears, and they made no secret of
their bearing weapons; but under each man's aba was concealed the
largest barley-sack he could find in his house, and concerning this no
one of the multitude said anything to his neighbour, for each hoped to
get a greater share than the others of the gold and precious stones from
the fabulous treasure stored in the palace. Then most of these men sat
down to wait, as vultures do before the camel is quite dead. But not
long after the middle of the night they were joined by a great throng of
Bedouins from Abdullah's tribe. These had been admitted into the city by
the watchman according to the agreement, and passed up the great street
from the Hasa gate, in a close body, not speaking and making but little
noise with their feet as they walked; yet all of them together could be
heard from a distance, because they were so many, and the sound was like
the night wind among the branches of dry palm trees. After them, other
Bedouins came in from camps both near and far, some of them having made
half a day's journey since sunset; and they surrounded the palace on all
sides, and filled the great street, and the street which passes by the
mosque towards the Dereyiyah gate and all the other approaches to the
open square, sitting down wherever there was room, or leaning against
the closed shops of the bazar, or standing up in a thick crowd when they
were too closely pressed to be at ease. They talked together from time
to time in low tones, but when their voices rose above a whisper some
man in authority hushed them saying that the hour was not yet come.

'By this time Abdullah has slain Khaled,' said some, 'and the daughter
of the old Sultan is a prisoner.'

'And by this time,' said others, 'Abdullah is surely unlocking the
treasure chamber and filling a barley-sack with pearls and rubies. It is
certain that he who slays the lion deserves his bride, but we hope that
something will be left for us.'

'Hush!' said the voice of one moving in the darkness. 'Be patient. It is
not yet time.'

Then, for a space, a deep silence fell on the speakers and they crouched
