" Of course," said Fulkerson, with some trouble in 
his face. "I appreciate your feeling. But there 
ain't any danger," he added buoyantly. "Anyhow, 



  

you spoke too late, as the Irisliman said to the 
chicken when he swallowecl liini in a fresh egg. 
I've asked Lindau, and he's accepted with blayzure; 
that's what he says." 

Maroh made no other comment than a shrug. 

"You'll see," Fulkerson continued, "it'll go off 
all right. I 'll engage to make it, and I won't hold 
anybody else responsible." 

In the course of his married life March had 
learned not to censure the irretrievable ; but this 
was just what his wife had not learned ; and she 
lioured out so much astonishment at what Fulker- 
son had done, and so much disapproval, that March 
began to palh'ate the situation a little. 

"After all, it isn't a question of life and death; 
and, if it were, I don't see how it's to be helped 
now." 

" Oh, it 's not to be helped now. But I am sur- 
prised at Mr. Fulkerson." 

" well, Fulkerson has his moments of being 
merely human, too." 

Mrs. March would not deign a direct defence of 
her favourite. " Well, I 'm glad there are not to be 
ladies." 

"I don't know. Dryfoos thought of having 
ladies, but it seems your infallible Fulkerson over- 
ruled him. Their presence might have kept Lindau 
and our host in bounds." 

It had become part of the Marches' conjugal joke 
for him to pretend that she could allow nothing 
wrong in Fulkerson, and he now laughed with a 



  

mocking air of having expected it when she said : 
" Well, then, if Mr. Fulkcrson says he will see that 
it all comes out right, I suppose you must trust his 
tact. I wouldn't trust yours, Basil. The first wrong 
step was taken when Mr. Lindau was asked to help 
on the magazine." 

" Well, it was your infallil)le Fulkersou that took 
the step, or at least suggested it. I 'm happy to say 
I had totally forgotten my early friend." 

Mrs. March was daunted and silenced for a 
moment. Then she said : " Oh, psliaw ! You 
know well enough he did it to please you." 

" I 'm very glad he didn't do it to please you, 
Isabel," said her husband, with affected seriousness. 
"Though i)erhaps he did." 

He began to look at the humorous aspect of the 
affair, which it certainly had, and to comment on 
the singular incongruities which Every Other IFcck 
was destined to involve at every moment of its 
career. " I wonder if I 'm mistaken in supposing 
that no other periodical was ever like it. Perhaps 
all periodicals are like it. But I don't believe 
there 's another publication in New York that could 
bring together, in honour of itself, a fraternity and 
equality crank like poor old Lindau, and a belated 
sociological crank like woodburn, and a truculent 
speculator like old Dryfoos, and a humanitarian 
dreamer like young Dryfoos, and a sentimentalist 
like me, and a nondescript like Beaton, and a pure 
advertising essence like Fulkerson, and a society 
si)irit like Kendricks. If we could only allow one 



  

another to talk uninterruptedly all the time, the 
dinner -would be the greatest success in the world, 
and we should come home full of the highest mutual 
respect. But I suspect we can't manage that — even 
your infallible Fulkerson couldn't work it — and I 'm 
afraid that there'll be some listening that'll spoil 
the pleasure of the time." 

March was so well pleased with this vicw of the 
case that he suggested the idea iuA'olved to Fulker- 
son. Fulkerson was too good a fellow not to laugh 
at another man's joke, but he laughed a little rue- 
fully, and he seemed worn with more than one kind 
of care in the interval that passed betwecn the 
present time and the night of the dinner. 

Dryfoos necessarily depended upon him for 
advice concerning the scope and nature of the 
dinner, but he received the advice suspiciously, and 
contested points of obvious propriety with per- 
tinacious stupidity. Fulkerson said that when it 
came to the point he would rather have had the 
thing, as he called it, at Delmonico's or some other 
restaurant ; but when he found that Dryfoos's pride 
was bound up in having it at his own house, he gave 
way to him. Dryfoos also wanted his woman-cook 
to prepare the dinner, but Fulkerson persuaded him 
that this would not do; he must have it from a 
caterer. Then Dryfoos wanted his maids to wait at 
table, but Fulkerson convinced him that this would 
be incongruous at a man's dinner. It was decided 
that the dinner should be sent in from Frescobaldi's, 
and Dryfoos went with Fulkerson to discuss it with 



  

the caterer. He insisted upon having cvcrytliiiig 
explained to him, and the reason for having it, and 
not somctliing else in its place ; and he treated 
Fulkerson anil Frescobaldi as if they werc in league 
to impose upon him. There were moments when 
Fulkerson saw the varnish of professional politeness 
cracking on the Neapolitan's volcanic surface, and 
caught a glimpse of the lava fires of the cook's 
nature beneath ; he trcmhled for Dryfoos, who was
