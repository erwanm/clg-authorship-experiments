a chance before to give their theories quite so much 
air. Oh my, how they did ride over us ! I 'm just 
going down to sec Beaton about the cover of the 
Christmas number. I think we ought to try it in 
three or four colours, if we are going to observe 
the day at all." He was off before March could 
pull himself together to ask what Dryfoos wantcd 
at the office at that hour of the morning ; he 
always came in the afternoon on his way uptown. 

The fact of his presence renewed the sinister mis- 



  

givings with which March had parted from him the 
night before, but Fulkerson's cheerfulness seemed 
to gainsay them ; afterwards March did not know 
whether to attribute this mood to the slipperiness 
that he was aware of at times in Fulkerson, or to a 
cynical amusement lie might have felt at leaving 
him alone to the old man, who mounted to his room 
shortly after March had reached it. 

A sort of dumb anger showed itself in his face ; 
his jaw was set so firmly that he did not seem able 
at once to open it. He asked, without the cere- 
monies of greeting, " What does that one-armed 
Dutchman do on this book ? " 

" What does he do ? " March echoed, as people 
are apt to do with a question that is mandatory and 
offensive. 

" Yes, sir, what does he do ? Does he write for 
it?" 

" I suppose you mean Lindau," said INIarch. He 
saw no reason for refusing to answer Dryfoos's de- 
mand, and he decided to ignore its terms. " No, he 
doesn't write for it in the usual way. He translates 
for it; he examines the foreign magazines, and draws 
my attention to anything he thinks of interest. But 
I told you about this before " 

" I know what you told me, well enough. And I 
know what he is. He is a red-mouthed labour- 
agitator. He's one of those foreigners that come 
here from places where they 've never had a decent 
meal's victuals in their lives, and as soon as they get 
their stomachs full, they begin to make trouble beW 


twecn our ])oople and their hands. There 's "where 
the strikes come from, and the unions and the secret 
societies. They come here and break our Sabbath, 
and teach their atheism. They ought to be hung ! 
Let 'em go back if they don't like it over here. 
They want to ruin the country." 

March could not help smiling a little at the words, 
which came fast enough now in the hoarse staccato of 
Dryfoos's passion. " I don't know whom you mean 
by they, generally speaking ; but I had the impres- 
sion that poor old Lindau had once done his best to 
save the country. I don't always like his way of 
talking, but I know that he is one of the truest and 
kindest souls in the world ; and he is no more an 
atheist than I am. He is my friend, and I can't 
allow him to be misunderstood." 

" I don't care wliat he is," Dryfoos broke out, " I 
won't have him roiind. He can't have any more 
work from this office. I want you to stop it. I 
want you to turn him ofT." 

March was standing at his desk, as he had risen 
to receive Dryfoos when he entered. He now sat 
down, and began to open his letters. 

"Do you hear ?" the old man roared at him. "I 
want you to turn him off." 

" Excuse me, Mr. Dryfoos," said March, succeed- 
ing in an effort to speak calmly, " I don't know 
you, in such a matter as this. My arrangements 
as editor of Every Other week were made with Mr. 
Fulkerson. I have ahvays listened to any sugges- 
tion he has had to make." 



  

" I don't care for Mr. Fulkcrson ! He has nothing 
to do with it," retorted Dryfoos ; but he seemed a 
little daunted by March's position. 

" He has everything to do with it as far as I am 
concerned," March answered, with a steadiness that 
he did not feel. " I know that you are the owner 
of the periodical, but I can't receive any suggestion 
from you, for the reason that I have given. Nobody 
but Mr. Fulkcrson has any right to talk with me 
about its management." 

Dryfoos glared at him for a moment, and de- 
manded threateningly : " Then you say you won't 
turn that old loafer off? You say that I have 
got to keep on paying my money out to buy 
beer for a man that would cut my throat if he 
got the chance ? " 

"I say nothing at all, Mr. Dryfoos," March 
answered. The blood came into his face, and he 
added : " But I v:iU say that if you speak again of 
Mr. Lindau in those terms, one of us must leave the
room. I will not hear you." 

Dryfoos looked at him with astonishment ; then 
he struck his hat down on his head, and stamped 
out of the room and down the stairs ; and a vague 
pity came into March's heart that was not altogether 
for himself. He might be the greater sufferer in the 
end, but he was sorry to have got the better of that 
old man for the moment ; and he felt ashamed of 
the anger into which Dryfoos's anger had surprised 
him. He knew he could not say too much in de- 
fence of Lindau's generosity and unselfishness, and 




he had not attempted to defend him as a poKtical 
economist. He could not have taken any ground in 
relation to Dryfoos but that which he held, and he 
felt satisfied that he was right in refusing to receive 
instructions or commands from him. Yet somehow 
he was not satisfied with the whole, ufi'air, and not
