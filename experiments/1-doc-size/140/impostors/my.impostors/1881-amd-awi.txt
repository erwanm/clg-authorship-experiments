joyousness ; " you must have seen that you were the great 
attraction of this place ; since mother's headaches unfit her 
for society, and Dolly is always engrossed in some way. 
Before you left town I tried to show you that you alone 
ware in my thoughts. It came to me like a lightning flash 
one day, and my whole path was illumined. Since then I 
have worshipped you in secret, and offered you the fra- 
grant savor of humble adoration — " 

" Don't," she cries, raising her hand authoritatively, 
while her cheeks flame with indignant blood. " Why do 
you say such things to me? " 

" Good heavens I Christmas, you do, you must understand 
that I offer you the great love of a man's life ; that I 
ask you to be my wife — " 

It is not the elegance of love making the young man 
indulges in when he is not in earnest ; but this is such an 
unfrequent mood that it sits awkwardly upon him. 

" I do not want to marry," she says, frankly, unable 
to decide whether it is real earnest. " I have planned 
out my life so differently from the pleasures you enjoy, 
and — " (she is honestly sorry to hurt him, for he has been 
a pleasant friend) — " I do not love you — in that way." 

" But you can learn, my darling. I have been awk« 



 



 





ward with my story. I meant to have told it better. 
Yon are the one woman for me. Yonr strength, yonr 
high ideals and ambitions, shall roose me to something 
worthy of you. My life shall not be spent in the trifles 
that have occupied it hitherto." 

" A man ought to make his life worthy before he offers 
it to any woman," Christmas Ormiston declares, with dig- 
nity. 

" Give me a little time, a little hope, and I will make it 
worthy. I will not hnrry you. You shall learn your 
sweet lesson with the most patient of teachers. You do 
not know your own white soul or its capabilities. Love 
with you will be a plant of slow growth." 

" I will not listen," she cries, sharply ; and before he is 
aware, she is flying up the path, and disappears in the 
wide doorway. To be rebuffed, in any manner, by a 
woman, is so new an experience to Ward AUaire, that his 
breath comes in gasps, as if he had been struck a physical 
blow. Anger succeeds the surprise. He opens the gate 
and wends his way briskly to the station. 

Christmas gains her room, slips the bolt on the door, 
and throws herself in the wicker chair by the window 
that looks out at the rear of the house. She is amazed, 
indignant Dolly has had proposals through the winter ; 
but no one has dared to approach such a subject with her. 
That she might be considered a prize in the matrimonial 
line does not occur to her. No part of her life has been 
productive of personal vanity, hardly self-esteem ; and 
the business at Camley has been represented to her as 
precarious in the extreme. There are women who would 
be glad to marry Ward Allaire ; she has seen them almost 
throw themselves at his head, and she shivers with disgust. 
There is nothing in his life that would suit her, and she 
cannot imagine the favorite of city drawing-rooms bury- 
ing himself at Camley Mills and Glen Orimston ; besides, 
sAs does not want a husband. She has been dreaming 





pasBionately of her own liberty. All these years she hus 
nursed the smouldering fire in silence, fairly revelling in the 
inner sight of the broad genial fiame in which she is to 
sun herself presently ; to live her own life ; and spring- 
ing np, she crosses the floor with the proud tread of a 
goddess. Can she afford to spend her long, glorious days 
in studying the becomingness of a gown, or considering 
Just the shade of manner to be used toward the people 
who shall fill her drawing-room in the evening ; can she 
carry herself with languid grace, and tone her interest to 
an artistic indifference, while the bright blood is bounding 
through her veins? 

" They can keep their brilUant, hollow world," she cries 
to herself. " I was not made for it. I am starved and 
stifled in it" 

Mrs. Allaire came down to luncheon in an amiable mood, 
and decided that she would like a drive while the air was 
still warm with the midday sun. Had the girls any engagement? 
Of course she could not go alone. 

" Christmas will go with you," responds Dolly. 
" Kate Conningsford is coming over to arrange about a 
german." 

Christmas does go, with an odd, questioning mood. 
What would Mrs. Allaire say if she knew her son had 
elected her, Christmas, to fill the important position of 
daughter to her? The girl's common-sense refuses to 
believe that she would approve of it Mrs. Allaire has a 
peculiar graciousness this afternoon, and it touches Christ- 
mas. She is really glad to be friends with them, and she 
will do nothing so foolish as to hold out the slightest hope 
to Ward. 

Two or three days pass, and Miss Ormiston smiles a 
little over her trepidation. The wretched fashion of — 
shall she call it flirtation?— -must have been answerable 
for the episode. Would not some of the young men who 
have knelt at Dolly's feet have been surprised if she had
