arched like a dome of joy above the tomb. 

" My Master 1 " 

She sprang towards him, crying and laughing, 
and her words began to fall fast, like drops pour- 
ing from a flagon of delight.

She fell at his feet, and stretched up her arms* 
But he motioned her back.

Now, about the city, and throughout Judea, and 
in all Palestine, great things woro said ; and as 
great were never said, tint took place in silence and 
in secrecy ; while others were whispered under oath 
of honorable persons, and so came into record. 

Past many an ancient tomb whose stones the earth- 
quake had loosened at the hour when the Nazarono 
gave up his ghost, stole silent figures ; into many a

home where the bereaved sat desolate, trod soundless 
footsteps. The latch lifted, the curtain stirred, the 
casement opened ; and one who had been mourned 
for years came in and took his old, familiar place, 
and smiling, looked about the room, to see if he 
were remembered. 

" The Resurrection " had been a theological 
phrase in Palestine, accepted by some, refused by 
others, and a puzzle to all. Now it came to be 
called a fact of history. For the dead had been 
seen abroad, and recognized. 

It also came, but not at once, to be understood 
that this mystery had some connection with the other, 
mightier one, which, in time, absorbed the interest 
of all thoughtful men. 

There were those who bowed their heads, and 
smote their breasts and said : " We have crucified a 
man. But we could not slay a God I " 

There were others who mused, and knew not what 
to say. These were less afraid of not recognizing 
a God than of deifying a man ; for this was their 
nature. And to all natures, the life and death of the 
great Narzarene remained a mystery. 

To none did the wonders which directly succeeded 
his death seem more mysterious at the time than to 
his chosen friends. The women camo with their 
joyous testimony 5 but they were women. The men 
listened to them in masculine incredulity ; they had 
found only an empty tomb. No disciple had seen 
angols ; and the Roman watchmen, Jfor f oar of their 
lives, and being heavily bribed, withhold their star- 
tling witness, aud thrust out the report that the body

had been stolen by the followers of the Nazarene 
while the guards slept at their posts. This childish 
tale was instigated by the priests, and the pardon of 
Pilate to the offending watchmen was a part of the 
price. 

Thus matters stood immediately after the death of 
Jesus. Then that happened which changed every- 
thing. 

It was the late afternoon of the first Easter, when 
two of the eleven, 1 restless with sorrow, went out by 
the western gate for a country walk. They took 
the direction of a little place called Emmaus a 
lovely village set over the hills in bloom and green. 
Life and light throbbed in the soft wind, in the gen- 
tle scenery. Thousands of birds were in the air. 
The soul of spring swayed by dreamily. But the 
hearts of the twain were as heavy as the clods of the 
grave. Their Lord was dead. 

In the bewilderment of fresh bereavement, they 
talked drearily, of him, of his great life, of his 
piteous death, of all that was precious and of all that 
was confusing to them in his history ; of the f ailtire 
of his purposes, of the ruin of their hopes and of 
his. 

A stranger joined them as they wore walking, 
it seemed that he was one of the festive bands with 
which the suburbs of Jerusalem had boon peopled 
the past week and entered into their conversation. 
They thought him a very ignorant man, though he 
had not that appearance, for he questioned them

THE RESURRECTION* AND THE LIFE 407 

minutely about the life and death of their Kabbi. 
Was there a foreigner in Jerusalem who had not 
heard what had happened? They answered him 
with a sort of surprised condescension, but they 
readily began to talk about their Lord ; indeed, they 
could not speak of anything else* And as they 
strolled and talked, their feeling about the stranger 
underwent one of the swift transformations which 
simple minds experience in the presence of a supe- 
rior* This was no ordinary tourist. This was a 
master of knowledge. He spoke of the Hebrew 
Messiah; of the meaning of ancient prophetic po- 
etry; of the possibilities hidden in the scriptures 
of the race. He spoke of the recent events that had 
shaken Palestine of the national hopes and of the 
national shame. 

The two disciples felt deeply drawn to the stranger ; 
their thoughts took a high turn ; courage and faith 
swept back upon their despairing hearts, like fire from 
heaven xtpon an abandoned altar. They clung so to 
the stranger that, when he would have left them and 
passed on up the country road, they could not, would 
not, have it so. They begged him, nay, they com- 
pelled him, to accept their hospitality. So he in- 
dulged them, smiling, and went to supper with them 
in their simple house of entertainment. ' There, it 
scorned the only right thing for him to do to take 
the head of the table ; his hosts did not even wonder
