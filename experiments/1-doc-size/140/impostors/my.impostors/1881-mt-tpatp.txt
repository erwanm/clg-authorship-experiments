back. They snatched Hnen from the hedges, occasionally, 
in full view of the owners, who made no 

protest, but only seemed grateful that they did not 
take the hedges, too. 

By and by they invaded a smaE farmhouse and 
made themselves at home while the trembling farmer 
and his people swept the larder clean to furnish a 
breakfast for them. They chucked the housewife 
and her daughters under the chin while receiving the 
food from their hands, and made coarse jests about 
them, accompanied with insulting epithets and 
bursts of horse-laughter. They threw bones and 
vegetables at the farmer and his sons, kept them 
dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously 
when a good hit was made. They ended by butter- 
ing the head of one of the daughters who resented 
some of their familiarities. When they took their 
leave they threatened to come back and bum the 
house over the heads of the family if any report of 
their doings got to the ears of the authorities. 

About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the 
gang came to a halt behind a hedge on the outskirts 
of a considerable village. An hour was allowed 
for rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad 
to enter the village at different points to ply them 
various trades. ‘ ‘ Jack ” was sent with Hugo. They 
wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo 
watching for opportunities to do a stroke of busi- 
ness but finding none — so he fimally said: 

“I see naught to steal ; it is a paltry place. WTiere- 
fore we will beg.” 

“We, forsooth! Follow thy trade — it bdSts thee. 
But I will not beg.” 

"Thou’lt not beg!” exclaimed Hugo, eying the 

king with surprise. “Prithee, since when hast thou 
reformed?” 

“What dost thou mean?” 

“Mean? Hast thou not begged the streets of 
London all thy life?” 

“I? Thou idiot!” 

“Spare thy compliments — thy stock will last the 
longer. Thy father says thou hast begged all thy 
days. Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will even 
make so bold as to say he Hed,” scoffed Hugo. 

“Him ym call my father? Yes, he lied.” 

“Come, play not thy merry game of madman 
so far, mate; use it for thy amusement, not thy 
hurt. An I tell him this, he will scorch thee finely 
for it.” 

“Save thyself the trouble. I will tell him.” 

“I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not ad- 
mire thy judgment. Bone-rackmgs and bastings be 
plenty enow in this life, without going out of one’s 
way to invite them. But a truce to these matters; 
I believe your father. I doubt not he can lie; I 
doubt not he doth lie, upon occasion, for the best of 
us do that; but there is no occasion here. A wise 
man does not waste so good a commodity as lying 
for naught. But come; sith it is thy htunor to give 
over begging, wherewithal shall we busy oursdves? 
With robbing kitchens?” 

Hie king said, impatiently; 

“Have done with this folly — you weary me!” 

Hugo replied, with temper: 

“Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will 
not rob; so be it. But I will tell you what you mil 

do. You mil play decoy whilst I beg. Refuse, an 
you think you may ventiire!” 

The king was about to reply contemptuously, 
when Hugo said, interrupting: 

“Peace! Here comes one with a kindly face. 
Now will I fall down in a fit. When the stranger 
runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon your 
knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as if all the 
devils of misery were in your belly, and say, ‘Oh, 
sir, it is my poor afflicted brother, and we be friendless; 
o’ God’s name cast through your merciful eyes 
one pitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most 
miserable wretch; bestow one little penny out of 
thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to 
perish!’ — and mind you, keep you on wailing, and 
abate not till we bilk him of his peniiy, else shall 
you rue it.” 

Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and 
groan, and roll his eyes, and reel and totter about; 
and when the stranger was dose at hand, down he 
sprawled before him., with a shriek, and began to 
writhe and wallow in the dirt, in seeming agony. 

“0 dear, 0 dear!” cried the benevolent stranger. 
“Oh, poor soul, poor soul, how he doth suffer! 
There — let me help thee up.’’ 

“O, noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a 
princely gentleman — but it giveth me cruel pain to 
touch me when I am taken so. My brother there 
will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish 
when these fits be upon me. A penny, dear sir, a 
penny, to buy a little food; then leave me to my 
sorrows.” 

“A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless 
creature” — and he fumbled in his pocket with 
nervous haste and got them out. “There, poor 
lad, take them, and most welcome. Now come 
hither, my boy, and help me carry thy stricken 
brother to yon house, where — ” 

“I am not his brother,” said the king, interrupting. 

‘ ‘ What ! not his brother ?’ ’ 

“Oh, hear him!” groaned Hugo, then privately 
ground his teeth. “He denies his own brother — and 
he with one foot in the grave!” 

“Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy
