tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty they were 
as if they had not been. He neither saw nor heard. 
Royalty had lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps 
were become a reproach. Remorse was eating his 
heart out. He said, “Would God I were free of 
my captivity!” 

He had unconsciously dropped back into the 
phraseology of the first days of his compulsory 
greatness. 

The s hinin g pageant still went winding fike a 
radiant and interminable serpent down the crooked 

lanes of the quaint old city, and through the 
huzzaing hosts; but still the king rode with bowed head 
and vacant eyes, seeing only his mother’s face and 
that wounded look in it. 

“Largess, largess!” The ciy fell upon an unheeding ear. 

“Long live Edward of England!” It seemed as 
if the earth shook with the explosion; but there was 
no response from the king. He heard it only as 
one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown 
to the ear out of a great distance, for it was 
smothered under another sound which was still nearer, in 
his own breast, in his accusing conscience — a voice 
which kept repeating those shameful words, “I do 
not know you, woman!” 

The words smote upon the king’s soul as the 
strokes of a funeral bell smite upon the soul of a 
surviving friend when they remind him of secret 
treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone. 

New glories were unfolded at every turning; new 
wonders, new marvels, sprtmg into view; the pent 
clamors of waiting batteries were released; new 
raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multi- 
tudes; but the king gave no sign, and the accusing 
voice that went moaning through his comfortless 
breast was all the sound he heard. 

By and by the gladness in the faces of the 
populace changed a little, and became touched with a 
something like solicitude or anxiety; an abatement 
in the volume of applause was observable too. The 
Lord Protector was quick to notice these things; he 
was as quick to detect the cause. He spurred to 
the king’s side, bent low in his saddle, uncovered 
and said: 

“My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. The 
people observe thy downcast head, thy clouded 
mien, and they take it for an omen. Be advised;- 
unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these 
boding vapors, and disperse them. Lift up thy face, 
and smile upon the people.” 

So saying, the duke scattered a handful of coins 
to right and left, then retired to his place. The 
mock king did mechanically as he had been bidden. 
His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near 
enough or sharp enough to detect that. The noddings 
of his plumed head as he saluted his subjects 
were full of grace and graciousness; the largess which 
he delivered from his hand was royally liberal; so 
the people’s anxiety vanished, and the acclamations 
burst forth again in as mighty a volume as before. 

Still once more, a little before the progress was 
ended, the duke was obliged to ride forward, and 
make remonstrance. He whispered: 

“O dread sovereign! shake oS these fatal humors; 
the eyes of the world are upon thee.” Then he 
added with sharp annoyance, “Perdition catch that 
crazy pauper! ’twas she that hath disturbed your 
Highness.” 

The gorgeous figure turned a lusterless eye upon 
the duke, and said in a dead voice: 

“She was my mother!” 

“My God!” groaned the Protector as he reined 
his horse backward to his post, “the omen was 
pregnant with prophecy. He is gone mad again!” 


CORONATION DAY 

Let us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves 
in Westminster Abbey, at four o’clock 
in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day. 
We are not without company; for although it is 
still night, we find the torch-lighted galleries already 
filling up with people who are well content to sit 
still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall 
come for them to see what they may not hope to see 
twice in their lives — the coronation of a king. Yes, 
London and Westminster have been astir ever since 
the warning guns boomed at three o’clock, and 
already crowds of untitled rich folk who have bought 
the privilege of trying to find sitting-room in the 
galleries are flocking in at the entrances reserved for 
their sort. 

The hours drag along, tediously enough. All 
stir has ceased for some time, for every gallery has 
long ago been packed. We may sit now, and look 
and think at our leisure. We have glimpses, here 
and there and yonder, through the dim cathedral 
twilight, of portions of many galleries and balconies, 
wedged full with people, the other portions of these 
galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by 
intervening pillars and architectural projections. We 

have in view the whole of the great north transept — ' 
empty, and waiting for England’s privileged ones. 
We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted 
with rich stuffs, whereon the throne stands. The 
throne occupies the center of the platform, and is 
raised above it upon an elevation of four steps. 
Within the seat of the throne is inclosed a rough flat 
rock — the stone of Scone — which many genera- 
tions of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned, and so 
it in time became holy enough to answer a like ptu- 
pose for English monarchs. Both the throne and 
its footstool are covered with cloth-of-gold. 

Stillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time 
drags heavily. But at last the lagging daylight 
asserts itself, the torches are extinguished, and a 
mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All 
features of the noble building are distinct now, but 
soft and dreamy, for the sun is lightly veiled with 
clouds.
