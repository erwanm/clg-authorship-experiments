"What do you say?" said he gently. "Would 
you prefer to go to Boston first, and be married 
from Mrs. Bowdoiri's house ? " 

"Oh no! "I said. " Oh no ! " 

" We want all our time in Europe now, for I 
mean to take you first to the south of France and 
from there overland to Rome, before we sail fox. 
Egypt. So the sooner we are off the better. But 
would you mind making the journey first to Philadelphia, just to let my mother see you ? " 

" Mind ? " I repeated. " I should be so delighted 
to see her again ! " 

So it was arranged; and I could think of no way 
that I would have liked it better. 

We had no peas for dinner. Good Miss Pollty 
would have picked them herself, but she thought 
I had done it, until it was too late to mend mat 
ters. She had the intense delight of dining with 
us. I knew it would be a feather in her cap that 
would never cease to flourish; and I was amused 



 

at one or two little satisfied nods of her head that 
I got after dinner. We had arranged, at least I 
had. at Mr. Iredell's suggestion and upon his authority, that Miss Polly should represent me in the 
house until Mrs. Quick's return ; at a rate of pay 
ment which would, I knew, make my going away 
rather a blessed thing for the old lady. Arethusa 
had not been told of anything, and I forbade that 
she should, until I was gone. 

Evening came, sultry, warm and still, as the day 
had been. I had done what I had to do, and was 
sitting in the porch when Mr. Iredell came back 
from his visit to Mr. Macartney. Miss Polly had 
gone home to shut up her house. The sun had set; 
the west was covered with a warm hazy glow; the 
line of hills was dark and growing darker; over 
head a star here and there was faintly peeping out. 
The chirruping of insects was very busy; locusts 
and crickets and grasshoppers and katydids were 
having a good time; otherwise the deepest silence 
rested upon the Chesterfield world. Mr. Iredell's 
step returning was the only one heard, and the 
only notification of human presence in the neigh 
bourhood. He came in and took a seat in the 
porch beside me. 

" I find I am regarded in the light of anything 
but a benefactor to Chesterfield " he began. 

"Chesterfield has been accustomed to me now 
for a good while," I said. 

"And those are the hills which you used to say 
shut you in, like the Happy Valley of Rasst las," 



 

Mr. Iredell went on after a pause. " How has life 
been here all these years, my Desire ? " 

I hesitated now. 

"Different, of course, at different times," I said. 
" But I remembered a word you once said to me, 
years ago, that life is, to do the will of God ; 
and you know, that makes a sweet kind of a life." 

"Doesn't it!" said he, stretching out his hand and 
taking mine into its clasp. " If the world knew ! 
Desire, have you all ready ? " 

"Yes," said I; "there was neither much to take 
nor much to leave. You do not understand the 
simplicity of such household arrangements, Mr. 
Iredell. There is only one thing I should like to 
have go with me, one little packing case ; I should 
feel as if it were safer at Philadelphia than here. 
Would it be much trouble ? " 

"What a question!" said Mr. Iredell. "You can 
do what you like, and have what you like, Desire. 
What is it?" 

" It is my St. Cecilia," said I softly. " Do you 
recollect giving it to me ? " 

" I remember," said he gravely ; " and I remember I thought you did not care for it." 

" Care for it ! " said I ; " I cared so much It was 
because " 

" I know ! " said he, clasping my hand closer; and 
then we were both silent, for his tone stopped me. 
After a little he began again. 

" There ought to be no secrets between us, Deeire, and those there are not ; but there ought to be 



 

further no shadow of doubt or question on anything- 
in the past. Once for all we must speak of it; and 
now is a good time. Then it may sleep." 

"There is no doubt or question, I think, in my 
mind," I said tremulously. 

Are you satisfied with me and my action ? " 

Why, certainly ! " said I more steadily. 

" I am not satisfied with myself," he returned. 
" I made a mistake, which a man is a fool to make/ 
But I was utterly misled. I ought to have rented 
with nothing short of my answer from your own 
mouth." 

I said nothing. 

" I was made to believe that in your girlish simplicity, which indeed I knew and loved, you had 
never thought of me except as a kindly acquaintance; and that any direct application to yourself 
would only serve to frighten and distress you. I 
thought your sister must know and I believed 
her." 

" I know " I whispered. 

"What was the truth?"
