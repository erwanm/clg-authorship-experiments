Lilacs. 

When I was alone, which did not happen till I 
went to my room at night, I sat down to do some 
thinking. Ever since Mrs. St. Ives quitted the 
house, I had been aware of a certain plan loom 
ing up before me which I must put in execution. 
I must go home to Chesterfield. For a time, at 
any rate, I must go home. And there are two 
reasons. In the first place, Mrs. Bowdoin is taking things for granted about my acceptance of her 
proposition. I am not clear yet as to what I ought 
to do. And I do not think I can be clear, till I go 
home and look at the question calmly from a Ches 
terfield point of view. Once there for a little while, 
and I think it would be shewn me what I must do. 

So that is a reason for going at once. Yet it is 
not the reason that is driving me. And I am in a 
fever of haste to be gone. I am rather surprised 
at myself; but the fact is, I want to get away be 
fore Mr. Iredell comes. I do not want to see him. 
True, he has been nothing to me for a very long 
time, except ah me ! how much he has been to 
me nevertheless! Still it was only in my secret 
thought. Practically, he and I have been very far 



 

apart; for long there has been not even the most 
superficial contact. What should his going abroad 
be to me ? But the news of it touched me like a 
cold mist coming up and hiding the sunshine; and 
it seems to me I have not felt warm since. I can 
not see him and bid good bye to him; there -is no 
need I should; it will be nothing to miss, for him, 
and it will be something to escape, for me. 

I am in the same room wllere I watched through 
that dreadful night twelve years ago. Was the 
work at that time not thoroughly done ? the work 
of submission and relinquishing? Yes, I think so; 
and yet it is strange how much fire can live under 
so much ashes. Twelve years! and my heart is 
beating yet, and tears are welling into my eyes, 
and falling hot on my hands. I am not taking 
back anything I ever gave up, I am riot even repining, I think; but memory is alive and pricks me 
with incessant pricks of pain; and I have an odd 
sort of pity for myself. Yes, Desire; you had 
better get home and get reasonable, as fast as 
possible. 



Chesterfield, July 10. 

I WAS afraid to say a word of my intention the 
next day, for fear Mrs. Bowdoin might connect 
things which I did not wish her to think of to 
gether. With my heart in my mouth, I waited 
over one day, trembling lest Mr. Iredell should in 



 

the meanwhile come; but I dared do no other 
The second day I spoke. I told Mrs. Bowdoin that 
I must go home for a little, and must go at once; 
I told her I had reasons for wishing to be at Ches 
terfield immediately; I had something to do there. 
Which was eminently true, though she was far 
from dreaming what. I carried my point, and got 
away, two days ago. 

I put off thinking till I got home. There I found 
some new material. Arethusa was laid up with a 
sort of intermittent fever, which keeps her in bed ; 
and Mrs. /JJuick was quivering with the desire to 
take a journey as far as St. Albans, to be present 
at her son's wedding, who is settled there. She 
had been just about to summon Miss Polly Binninger to take her place and set her free to go. So I 
came at the right time ; packed Mrs. Quick off, and 
fell naturally into my old position. I am alone in 
the house; but I do not care about that, for just 
now I want leisure to think, and I like to have no 
hindrance. To tell the truth, I could not do much 
thinking the first day, what with the house and 
Arethusa and getting Mrs. Quick off; and at night 
I was too tired to do anything but sleep. To-day 
again I was fully engaged all the morning. Late 
in the afternoon, as Arethusa did not want me, I 
went out to the porch for a breath of air, and sat 
down in the doorway. 

Hot summer all over the land; hot and breathless. Late roses are blossoming still ; the sight and 
the smell of them came to me with its reminder. 

 

That is nothing; they always remind me. Mem 
ory does not die. Does nothing die ? For here I 
felt myself oppressed with a sudden feeling of lone 
liness, because because Mr. Iredell is going 
abroad. "What is that to me ? All this year and 
more I have not seen him nor heard from him; he 
is nothing to my life and has no concern in it, nor 
I in his. I know that. I never had. And yet, 
the news that he is going has brought a cloud 
over the whole sky for me; and I feel alone, with 
a sudden depressing sense of loneliness. I am like 
a traveller on a desolate track, who for a long 
while has taken a certain sort of pleasure in a far- 
off, vaguely seen, figure of another traveller; and 
now of a sudden that figure disappears and the 
road is empty. Full of people, and yet empty. 
How strange it is! Yet I put it wrong; each individual life-track is not full of people; it really 
touches, or is touched by, only a very few. This 
one has touched mine ; and now that he goes out 
of sight, it is impossible to say how long and empty 
the life-track looks before me; how barren the SAveet 
outlines of my Chesterfield hills. It is utterly un 
reasonable, utterly unreasonable ! The intercourse 
between us, all these years; whenever there with 
any intercourse, gave no nourishment to any such 
feeling; except so far as in the necessary facts of 
the case it was nourished by the simple sight ami 
hearing of him, and therefore I avoided the sight 
and hearing of him. Mr. Iredell was always like 
a kind brother to me, in consideration and care- 



 

taking and protection; that never failed; but in 
manner I could not even call him brotherly. I al 
ways felt that to him I was Olive's sister, not his 
own. The liking he once had for me had been
