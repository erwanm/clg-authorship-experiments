 

think girls and women are always friendly to 
each other, and I was a most unpromising object, 
was I not? I sometimes try to recall myself. It 
seems mean to say it, but I suppose if the money 
had been exploited first — " 

"You would have had more attention, I am 
truly ashamed to say. But girls do satirize and 
turn any point they can catch into ridicule and 
are often unjust. Some persons insist that this 
strengthens the character — it may harden it, but 
I doubt if it is ever beneficial except to those silly, 
sentimental girls who are always exaggerating 
their own feelings and have to be laughed out of 
their follies. Only it seems to me a kindly wel- 
come is better among girls until you have 
thoroughly tested them." 

"And I can't make you any return — " in a dis- 
appointed tone. 

"You are returning all the time," and Helen 
smiled brightly up at her friend. "You have 
made efforts of which every girl would not have 
been capable. Many would have been discour- 
aged and given up study, taken the softer side 
of life. And you are making yourself a true 
woman. There! doesn't that seem patronizing 
and like the commendations one reads in 
'Answers to Correspondents ?' " 




Helen laughed with a gay iflavor, then con- 
tinued: "And I shall ask for your congratula- 
tions. I shall have enough money to take me 
through college, with a wise and judicious econ- 
omy — doesn't that sound sensible? I don't dare 
build air castles so far off, or plan what I shall 
do then. But, Juliet, you have grown stronger, 
more resolute, it shines in your eyes. And I 
remarked it in your manner at the table." 

"I am glad if you see any change. After my 
visit to you and understanding how bravely you 
were taking up a great cross, I resolved not to 
live so much to myself or in myself. It is the 
good seed you have sown. You make life in- 
spiring, because you are helpful everywhere." 

"Not always. I make mistakes." 

"But you have the courage that tries at once 
to surmount them. That is what I lack, the 
resolution for the second effort. I hate to be re- 
buffed." 

"Do you always go out half-way to meet 
others?" 

"No, I don't, but I am trying a little. I felt 
so sorry for those Gartney children, and I did 
really make an effort." 

"They seem very fond of you." 

"Yes. They opened their poor, trembling lit- 



 

tie hearts to me one day. Their father had been 
very fond of them — he was some sort of a news- 
paper man. They played about in his study, and 
he took them out to walk. They were first every- 
where until the new wife came. I don't suppose 
she is positively unkind, but they are shut out 
of the old love and it sort of bewilders them. 
So I thought what you were to me, arid I was 
a woman grown, though a child in the experience 
of affection." 

"That is the currency of good will that goes 
round the world — thinking of others. Oh, that 
is the bell, and we must not transgress, though 
we could talk all night," and Helen smiled 
archly. 

Was she really back at Aldred House? She 
could not sleep for her brain kept reviewing the 
pictures of the past. She remembered how she 
and Daisy Bell had a school-girl tiff one night 
about Juliet Craven, and Daisy had been hard 
and ungracious, and afterward, in the midst of 
her evening prayer two soft arms had stolen 
about her neck and the sweet warm lips had 
kissed her. And last winter there had come this 
misunderstanding in which Daisy refused to 
listen to any explanation. Could she, ought she, 
make an effort to win her back ? She loved Mrs. 



 

Bell SO much. She had a stronger nature than 
Mrs. Wilmarth, and a clearer judgment in many 
respects. 

"I don't know how I have come to love so 
many people," and Helen sighed softly as if she 
had been in the wrong. 

It was rather difficult to find her exact stand- 
ing, for her class had gone ahead of her in most 
studies. Madame Meran bewailed her loss in 
French and music, and said with uplifted hands, 
"Oh, you poor child!" But Helen accepted the 
set-back and the solitary recitations with her 
usual cheerfulness. She and Juliet would keep 
step. 

She studied Daisy with some curiosity. She 
was really a young lady, the head of a little 
clique who clustered about her as satellites. She 
was still small and dainty, fair and easily flushing, 
the lips soft and full with smiles and tremors and 
fun mingling at times. Her shining hair flashed 
with every quick turn of her head, and her eyes 
could take to themselves bewildering lights. She 
studied different ways to make herself attractive, 
and she dearly loved to be admired. 

Of course they had to meet and speak. They
