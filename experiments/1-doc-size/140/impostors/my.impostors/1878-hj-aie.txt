mont, Esq." The letter had been given to the 
two Englishmen by a good friend of theirs in London, who had been in America two years previous 
ly, and had singled out Mr. J. L. Westgate from 
the many friends he had left there as the consignee, as it were, of his compatriots. " He is a 
capital fellow," the Englishman in London had 
said, "and he has got an awfully pretty wife. 
He 's tremendously hospitable he will do every 
thing in the world for you ; and as he knows every 
one over there, it is quite needless I should give 
you any other introduction. He will make you 
see every one ; trust to him for putting you into 
circulation. He has got a tremendously pretty 
wife." It was natural that in the hour of tribulation Lord Lambeth and Mr. Percy Beaumont 





should have bethought themselves of a gentleman 
whose attractions had been thus vividly depicted ; 
all the more so that he lived in the Fifth Avenue, 
and that the Fifth Avenue, as they had ascertained the night before, was contiguous to their hotel. 
"Ten to one he'll be out of town," said Percy 
Beaumont ; " but we can at least find out where 
he has gone, and we can immediately start in pur 
suit. He can 't possibly have gone to a hotter 
place, you know." 

" Oh, there 's only one hotter place," said Lord 
Lambeth, " and I hope he hasn't gone there." 

They strolled along the shady side of the street 
to the number indicated upon the precious letter. 
The house presented an imposing chocolate-color 
ed expanse, relieved by facings and window cor 
nices of florid sculpture, and by a couple of dusty 
rose-trees which clambered over the balconies and 
the portico. This last-mentioned feature was approached by a monumental flight of steps. 

"Kather better than a London house," said 
Lord Lambeth, looking down from this altitude, 
after they had rung the bell. 

"It depends upon what London house you 
mean," replied his companion. "You have a 
tremendous chance to get wet between the house 
door and your carriage." 

"Well," said Lord Lambeth, glancing at the 
burning heavens, "I guess it doesn 't rain so 
much here ?" 

The door was opened by a long negro in a white 
jacket, who grinned familiarly when Lord Lambeth asked for Mr. Westgate. 

" He ain't at home, Sah ; he 's down town at his 
office." 

"Oh, at his office?" said the visitors. "And 
when will he be at home V" 

"Well, Sah, when he goes out dis way in de 
mo ning, he ain't liable to come home all day." 

This was discouraging ; but the address of Mr. 
Westgate 's office was freely imparted by the intelligent black, and was taken down by Percy 
Beaumont in his pocket-book. The two gentle 
men then returned, languidly, to their hotel, and 
sent for a hackney-coach, and in this commodious vehicle they rolled comfortably down town. 
They measured the whole length of Broadway, 
again, and found it a path of fire ; and then, deflecting to the left, they were deposited by their 
conductor before a fresh, light, ornamental structure, ten stories high, in a street crowded with 
keen-faced, light-limbed young men, who were 
running about very quickly, and stopping each 
other eagerly at corners and in doorways. Passing into this brilliant building, they were intro 
duced by one of the keen-faced young men. he 
was a charming fellow, in wonderful cream-color 
ed garments and a bat with a blue ribbon, who 
had evidently perceived them to be aliens and 
helpless to a very snug hydraulic elevator, in 
which they took their place with many other per 
sons, and which, shooting upward in its vertical 
socket, presently projected them into the seventh 
horizontal compartment of the edifice. Here, after brief delay, they found themselves face to face 
with the friend of their friend in London. His 
office was composed of several different rooms, 
and they waited very silently in one of them aft 
er they had sent in their letter and their cards. 
The letter was not one which it would take Mr. 
Westgate very long to read, but he came out to 
speak to them more instantly than they could 
have expected ; he had evidently jumped up from 
his work. He was a tall, lean personage, and was 
dressed all in fresh white linen ; he had a thin, 
sharp, familiar face, with an expression that was 
at one and the same time sociable and business 
like, a quick, intelligent eye, and a large brown 
mustache, which concealed his mouth and made 
his chin, beneath it, look small. Lord Lambeth 
thought he looked tremendously clever. 

" How do you do, Lord Lambeth how do you 
do, Sir ?" he said, holding the open letter in his 
hand. " I'm very glad to see you ; I hope you 're 
very well. You had better come in here ; I think 
it 's cooler," and he led the way into another room, 
where there were law books and papers, and win 
dows wide open beneath striped awning. Just 
opposite one of the windows, on a line with his 
eyes, Lord Lambeth observed the weather-vane 
of a church steeple. The uproar of the street 
sounded infinitely far below, and Lord Lambeth 
felt very high in the air. "I say it 's cooler," 
pursued their host, " but every thing is relative. 
How do you stand the heat ?" 

" I can 't say we like it," said Lord Lambeth ; 
" but Beaumont likes it better than I." 

" Well, it won 't last," Mr. Westgate very cheer 
fully declared ; " nothing unpleasant lasts over 
here. It was very hot when Captain Littledale 
was here ; he did nothing but drink sherry-cobblers. He expresses some doubt in his letter 
whether I will remember him as if I didn 't 
remember making six sherry-cobblers for him 
one day in about twenty minutes. I hope you 
left him well, two years having elapsed since 
then. " 

" Oh yes, he 's all right," said Lord Lambeth. 

" I am always very glad to see your country 
men," Mr. Westgate pursued. "I thought it 
would be time some of you should be coming 
along. A friend of mine was saying to me only
