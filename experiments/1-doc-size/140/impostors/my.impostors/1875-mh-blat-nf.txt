Make a custard of milk, eggs and sugar; heat almost to a boil and
stir in the corn-starch wet with milk. Cook one minute; take from the
fire and pour, a little at a time, over the bread-crumbs; beating
into a rather thick batter. Butter a mould thickly; line it with the
macaroons, and put, spoonful by spoonful, a layer of batter in the
bottom. Cover this with suet, then raisins; sprinkle with sugar—put in
more batter, and so on until the mould is nearly full. Fit on the top;
put into the steamer over a pot of boiling water and steam, with the
water at a hard boil, at least two hours. Dip the mould into cold water
to make the pudding leave the sides; let it stand a moment, and turn
out, with care, upon a hot dish.

Eat hot with wine sauce.


CUSTARD BREAD PUDDING. (Boiled.) +

2 cupfuls fine bread-crumbs—stale and dry.

1 quart of milk.

6 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.

1 table-spoonful rice flour.

1 teaspoonful salt, and ½ teaspoonful soda.

Flavor to taste.

Soak the bread-crumbs in the milk; put into a farina-kettle and heat
almost to a boil. Stir in the rice-flour wet with cold milk; cook one
minute; turn into a basin and beat hard several minutes. When almost
cold, add the yolks of the eggs, the soda (dissolved in hot water) and
the flavoring; finally, the whipped whites, mixing them in swiftly and
thoroughly. Boil in a greased mould an hour and a half. Turn out, and
eat hot with sweet sauce.


MACARONI AND ALMOND PUDDING.

½ pound best Italian macaroni, broken into inch lengths.

3 pints milk.

2 table-spoonfuls butter.

1 cup white sugar.

5 eggs.

½ pound sweet almonds, blanched and chopped.

Rose-water and bitter almond flavoring.

A little salt and nutmeg.

Simmer the macaroni half an hour in a pint of the milk.

Stir in the butter and salt. Cover the saucepan, and take from the
fire, letting it stand covered while you make a custard of the rest
of the milk, the eggs and sugar. Chop the almonds, adding rose-water
to keep them from oiling. When the macaroni is nearly cold, put into
the custard; stir up well, but break it as little as possible; put in
nutmeg, bitter-almond extract; lastly the almonds.

Bake in the dish in which it is to be served.


PLAIN MACARONI PUDDING. +

¼ pound macaroni, broken into pieces an inch long.

1 pint water.

1 table-spoonful butter.

1 large cup of milk.

2 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.

Grated peel of half a lemon.

A little cinnamon and salt.

Boil the macaroni slowly in the water, in one vessel set within another
of hot water, until it is tender and has soaked up the water. Add the
butter and salt. Let it stand covered five minutes without removing it
from the range; put in the rest of the ingredients. Stir frequently,
taking care not to break the macaroni, and simmer, covered ten minutes
longer before turning it out into a deep dish.

Eat hot with butter and sugar, or sugar and cream.


ESSEX PUDDING.

2 cups fine bread-crumbs.

¾ cup powdered suet.

2 table-spoonfuls sago, soaked over night in a little water.

5 eggs, beaten light.

1 cup of milk.

1 cup of sugar.

1 table-spoonful corn-starch, wet in cold milk.

About ½ pound whole raisins, “plumped” by laying them in boiling
water two minutes.

A little salt.

Set the sago over the fire in a farina-kettle with enough water to
cover it, and let it cook gently until tender and nearly dry. Make a
custard of the eggs, milk and sugar; add the crumbs, beating into a
thick batter; next the suet, corn-starch, sago and salt. Beat all up
long and hard.

Butter a mould very thickly, and lay the raisins in the bottom and
sides, in rings or stripes, or whatever pattern you may fancy. Fill the
mould by spoonfuls—not to spoil your pattern—with the batter. Steam one
hour and a half, or boil one hour.

Dip in cold water; let it stand one minute, and turn out upon a flat
dish. The raisins should be imbedded in the pudding, but distinctly
visible upon the surface.

Eat with jelly sauce.
