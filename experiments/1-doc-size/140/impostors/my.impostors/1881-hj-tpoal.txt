" I like them in that position better than in some others," 
cried Mrs. Touchett, with a laugh. 



" Should you like me better if I were your butler, dear 1 " her 
husband asked. 

" I don't think I should ; you would make a very poor 
butler." 

" The companions of freemen I like that, Miss Stackpole," 
said Ralph. " It's a beautiful description." 

" When I said freemen, I didn't mean you, sir ! " 

And this was the only reward that Ralph got for his compli- 
ment. Miss Stackpole was baffled ; she evidently thought thero 
was something treasonable in Mrs. Touchett's appreciation of a 
class which she privately suspected of being a mysterious survival 
of feudalism. It was perhaps because her mind was oppressed 
with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she 
said to Isabel in the morning, while they were alone together, 

" My dear friend, I wonder whether you are growing faith- 
less r 

" Faithless 1 Faithless to you, Henrietta 1 " 

" No, that would be a great pain ; but it is not that." 

" Faithless to ray country, then 1 " 

"Ah, that I hope will never be. When I wrote to you 
from Liverpool, I said I had something particular to tell you. 
You have never asked me what it is. Is it because you have 
suspected 1 " 

" Suspected what   As a ride, I don't think I suspect," said 
Isabel. " I remember now that phrase in your letter, but I 
confess I had forgotten it. What have you to tell me ? " 

Henrietta looked disappointed, and her steady gaze betrayed it. 

" You don't ask that right as if you thought it important. 
You are changed you are thinking of other things." 

" Tell me what you mean, and I will think of that." 

" Will you really think of it 1 That is what I wish to be 
sure of." 

" I have not much control of my thoughts, but I will do my 
best," said Isabel. 

Henrietta gazed at her, in silence, for a period of time which 
tried Isabel's patience, so that our heroine said at last 

" Do you mean that you are going to be married 1 " 

" Not till I have seen Europe ! " said Miss Stackpole. " What 
are you laughing at 1 " she went on. " What I mean is, that Mr. 
Goodwood came out in the steamer with me." 

" Ah ! " Is-abel exclaimed, quickly. 

" You say that right. I had a good deal of talk with nim ; 
lie has come after you." 

" Did he tell you so 1 " 



 

"No, he told me nothing; that's how I knew it," said 
Henrietta, cleverly. " He said very little about you, but I spoke 
of you a good deal." 

Isabel was silent a moment. At the mention of Mr. Good- 
wood's name she had coloured a little, and now her blush was 
slowly fading. 

" I am very sorry you did that," she observed at last. 

" It was a pleasure to me, and I liked the way he listened. 
I could have talked a long time to such a listener ; he was 
so quiet, so intense ; he drank it all in." 

" What did you say about me 1 " Isabel asked. 

' I said you were on the whole the finest creature I know." 

" I am very sorry for that. He thinks too well of me already ; 
he ought not to be encouraged." 

" He is dying for a little encouragement. I see his face now, 
and his earnest, absorbed look, while I talked. I never saw an 
ugly man look so handsome ! " 

" He is very simple-minded," said Isabel. " And he is not 
so ugly." 

" There is nothing so simple as a great passion." 

" It is not a great passion ; I am very sure it is not that." 

" You don't say that as if you were sure." 

Isabel gave rather a cold smile. 

" I shall say it better to Mr. Goodwood himself ! " 

" He will soon give you a chance," said Henrietta. 

Isabel offered no answer to this assertion, which her com- 
panion made with an air of gre.at confidence. 

" He will find you changed," the latter pursued. " You have 
been affected by your new surroundings." 

" Very likely. I am affected by everything." 

" By everything but Mr. Goodwood ! " Miss Stackpole ex- 
claimed, with a laugh. 

Isabel failed even to smile in reply ; and in a moment she 
said 

" Did he ask you to speak to me I " 

"Not in so many words. But his eyes asked it and his 
handshake, when he bade me good-bye." 

" Thank you for doing so." And Isabel turned away. 

"Yes, you are changed ; you have got new ideas over here," 
her friend continued.
