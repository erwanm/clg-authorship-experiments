not be safe in their hands. 

"What shall we do, Wilford ? " said Taylor. 
" Can't you persuade your brother to take hold 
again ? " 

"He's as obstinate as a mule; but I'll try," re- 
plied Ben, as he went on the wharf, followed by the 
dissipated creditor, who was very unwilling to relin- 
quish the prospect of the good time h.<t anticipated. 

" Offer him twenty dollars for his day's work," 
added Taylor. 

" I may be able to compromise with him, if you're 
willing." 

" Anything you please, if you can make him and 
the other fellow go with us." 

" Lawry, Mr. Taylor will give you twenty dollars 
if you will pilot the steamer to-day," said Ben, as he 
stepped up to his brother. 

" I wouldn't go for a hundred," replied the young 
pilot, "I won't go with you at any rate." 



 



" Don't be so obstinate, Lawry." 

" I engaged the boat to Mr. Sherwood, and I will 
not go with anybody else." ♦ 

" Mr. Sherwood won't care when he finds out that 
you are not to blame. You can't resist the law, and 
it isn't your fault." 

" Ben, I wouldn't do what you have done for all 
the steamers on the lake. You have got this man to 
attach the property, and take the house away from 
mother, just because you wanted to be captain of this 
steamer." 

" What's the use of talking about that, Lawry ? " 
replied Ben, impatiently. " I'm going to be captain 
of this steamer, anyhow ; and the sooner you make 
up your mind to it, the better it will be for you." 

" I can't help myself." 

" I know you can't, and for that reason you had 
better submit with a good grace. If you will take 
your place in the wheel-house, Mr. Taylor will re- 
move the attachment." 

" Will he ? " 

" I will," replied Taylor. 

" And put everything where it was before ? " asked 
Lawry. 





" Of course I am to be captain, and Mr. Taylor is 
to have the boat to-day," added Ben. 

" Mr. Taylor can't have her to-day," said Lawry, 
firmly. " I engaged her to Mr. Sherwood, and if 
anybody has her to-day, he must. That's all I want 
to say about it now." 

The young pilot turned on his heel and walked 
away. His brother and the creditor were conspira- 
tors, and he wanted nothing to do with them. He 
might have been less resolute, if he had not seen Mr. 
Sherwood's carriage stop at the head of the wharf. 

" Are you all ready, Lawry ? " asked Mr. Sherwood. 

The poor boy could make no reply ; he burst into 
tears, and turned away from his kind friend. 

"What's the matter, Lawry?" demanded • Mr. 
Sherwood, greatly astonished at this singular demon- 
stration. 

" I suppose he feels bad, sir," interposed the sher- 
iff. " The boat has been attached for his father's 
debts." 

" For his father's debts ! " exclaimed the rich 
gentleman. 

The officer gave him a full explanation of the case. 




" This will never do," added Mr. Sherwood, indig- 
nantly. " This boat is Lawry's property in his own 
right." 

" I think not," added Taylor, who enjoyed the 
confusion of Lawry's powerful friend. " Here's my 
lawyer ; he can explain the matter to you." 

" No explanation is needed," replied Mr. Sherwood. 

" The boy is a minor," said the legal gentleman, 
who had been invited to join his client in the excur- 
sion in the Woodville, and was therefore one of the 
disappointed party. 

" He may need a guardian, nothing more, to enable 
him to hold the property." 

"Perhaps you are more familiar with the law than 
I am, Mr. Sherwood," said the legal gentleman, 
pompously. " You gave this boat to the boy." 

" I did." 

" While she lay at the bottom of the lake she was 
worth nothing. She was an abandoned wreck. If 
you had any property at all in her, it was subject to 
the salvage. Lawry Wilford raised her. I suppose 
you are willing to believe that the boy's father is 
entitled to his earnings ? "
