free of water in the morning." 

" You are very kind, Mr. Sherwood, to take so 
much trouble." 

" The boys have worked so well that they deserve 
encouragement. May I take the ferry-boat to con- 
vey my men up to the steamer ? " 

" Certainly, sir.'* 

" Please not say a word to the boys." 

" I will not, sir. They will sleep like logs till 
morning, and not know a word about it." 

Mr. Sherwood marched his company down to the 
ferry-boat. They were armed with buckets ; and they 
had so many that the neighborhood must have been 
laid under contribution to supply them. The men 
 



 



embarked, and the sail was hoisted under the di- 
rection of Mr. Sherwood. Though the wind had 
subsided, there was still breeze enough to carry the 
bateau rapidly to her destination. Several lanterns 
brought by the battalion of balers were lighted, and 
the work was promptly commenced. The leader of 
the humane enterprise was of course perfectly familiar 
with the steamer. He stationed two men at the 
pumps, and formed three lines of balers, the first at 
the fore hatch, the second at the fire-room, and the 
third at the companion-way leading into the cabin. 

Mr. Sherwood encouraged the men to work well 
by the promise of extra pay ; and the laborers 
seemed to regard the occasion as a grand frolic. 
They exerted themselves to the utmost, and the 
buckets flew along the lines, while the pumps rolled 
out the water in a continuous flow. As the steamer, 
relieved of the weight that pressed her down, rose 
on the surface of the lake, it was only necessary to 
lift the water from below and pour it upon the 
deck, from which it would run off" itself. 

The job did not last long before such a strong 
force ; and in two hours the work of the balers 



 

was done, the water inside having fallen below the 
cabin floor. Then the men changed hands at the 
pumps every ten minutes, working them so rapidly 
that the water was soon exhausted from the well. 
Ethan had fully described the method by which the 
hole in the hull of the Woodville had been stopped ; 
but Mr. Sherwood had some doubts in regard to the 
strength of the material, and he went below to 
examine the place. Lawry and his fellow-laborer 
had had no opportunity to test the strength and 
fitness of the work they had done, while the boat 
was full of water. 

On examination, Mr. Sherwood found several small 
jets of water streaming through the seams between 
the planks, outside of the canvas carpet, which he 
stopped with packing from the engineer's store-room. 
The braces which the boys had put over the hole 
kept the oil-cloth in position, and when the packing 
had been driven into the open seams with a chisel 
and mallet, hardly any water came in around the 
aperture. The boys were warmly commended by 
their partial friend for the skill they had displayed 
in stopping the leak ; and some of the men, who 







were familiar with vessels, agreed that the steamer 
would not leak ten strokes an hour. 

It was therefore safe to leave her ; and Mr. Sher- 
wood was satisfied that the boys would not find the 
water up to the bottom of the cabin floor in the 
morning. He carefully examined every part of the, 
steamer, assisted by the experienced men of his 
party, to assure himself that everything was right 
before he left her. The pumps were tried again, 
just before they embarked for home, but they yielded 
only a few strokes of water. 

The party returned to the landing, and Mr. Sher- 
wood cautioned the men not to make any noise as 
they passed the cottage, fearful that the boys might 
be awakened, and the delightful surprise in store 
for them spoiled. But Lawry and Ethan, worn out 
by the fatigue and excitement of the day, slept like 
logs, and the discharge of a battery of artillery 
under their chamber window would hardly have 
aroused them from their slumbers. The men went 
to their several homes, and all was quiet at the 
ferry. 

A single stroke of the old clock in the kitchen 



 

of the cottage announced the hour, to those who 
were wakeful enough to hear it, when Benjamin 
Wilford came down the road. He had been at a 
low groggery in the village, nursing his wrath and 
jealousy with the vilest of liquors. For a young 
man of eighteen, he had a strong head, so far as the 
influence of whiskey was concerned, for though he 
had drank a great deal, he was far from overcome. 
The villanous stuff made a demon of him, and he 
could only think of his brother in command of the 
magnificent little steamer, while he, older and more 
experienced than Lawry, was only a cipher. The 
thought maddened him ; and when he reached the 
ferry-house, he sat down on a rock, and actually 
cried with anger and vexation. 

" I won't stand it," whined he, when he had wept 
a while. " If I don't run that steamboat, nobody 
shall."
