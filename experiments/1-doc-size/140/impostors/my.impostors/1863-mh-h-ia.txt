tones of her sovereign master. He carved savagely, and 
wasted as few decent words upon his guests as he could, 
taking no share whatever in the conversation that Lily, 
Robert, and Aleck tried to keep up, to cover his surliness 
and Mrs. Floyd's tremor. He broke a goblet, in pushing it 
roughly against the dish before him ; swore audibly at the 
quaking servants ; and finally ordered his second son from 
the table in a voice of thunder, for spilling water on the cloth. 
The colonel seldom went to church except in summer-time, 
when he could pass the hours of service out of doors, under 
:the trees shading the sacred edifice, talking politics with 
neighbors as graceless as himself. He had spent the fore 
noon of this Sabbath in examining his account-books 
;" business papers," his wife styled them, in a lame apology 
she offered in the drawing-room for his " being out of sorts ;" 
the having finished the meal he had succeeded in spoiling for 
;every one else, and stalked off up to his chamber for his 
Sunday afternoon nap. 

"It always gives him the blues to look over these tire 
some papers !" she sighed, while she tried to smile at the 
absurdity of allowing such trifles to mar one's happiness. 
; I often wish there were no money matters in the world. 
[ don't pretend to understand them myself!" 

" Few ladies do !" said Aleck. " They are among the ills 
of life which are confined almost exclusively to us unhappy 





Helen met Robert's eye with a forced smile, which was 
returned by one yet more mirthless. 

" Can he be so unjust, after all my frankness, as to imagine 
me mercenary ?" she thought, indignantly. 

His uncomfortable cogitations were, in reality, dwelling 
upon the strong likelihood that the " business papers" which 
had stirred up the colonel's bile appertained to the records 
of his stewardship over his niece's estate, and the certainty, 
if this were so, that there were vexatious trials of patience in 
store for himself, when he and the guardian came to the 
dreaded final settlement. 

The diversion was not unwelcome when Lily called him 
into her green-house, to inspect a plant he had sent her some 
time before. It was drooping and yellow, from some cause, 
whose discovery was beyond the reach of her horticultural 
acumen. Robert was a zealous and accomplished amateur 
florist, and his decision, after a minute examination of the 
flower, and inquiry into the course she had pursued towards 
it, was, that she was killing it with kindness. 

"You pet it too much; water it too abundantly; and 
dress the earth about the roots too often. Plants require 
rest, like animals. This needs a little wholesome neglect ; a 
judicious letting alone, with plenty of sunshine. That will 
bring it around, if it is not too far gone." 

Lily bent over the fading favorite in silence, until the 
large drops gathered in her eyes, and one fell upon the plant. 

"My dear child!" ejaculated Robert, in surprise, "I will 
procure a dozen more of the same kind for you, if you want 
them, sooner than you should shed a single tear ; and this 
may revive yet !" 

" I am not a child !" said she, passionately, " although 
everybody sees fit to treat me like one ! And it is not the 
flower, for the flower's sake, that I grieve over ! I was just 
thinking how every thing that I love best is taken from me. 




did care for that geranium, because you gave it to me, 
did I have always believed that you were one of the very, 
ry few who really liked me !" 

She plucked a rose and rent it apart, petal by petal, her 
pouting and trembling; the tears yet hanging, like 
&gt;arly dew, upon the gold fringe of her eyelids. She 
oked perilously pretty, Robert acknowledged, in his contious innocence of every thing except brotherly kindness, 
in his great, tender heart yearned at the sight and confession of her artless distress. What a guileless babe she 
jas ! How sinless and free her attachment for her early 
jaymate ! 

I " And you thought right, Lily ! There are not many 
people whom I like better than I do you as I have often 
Id you." 

" Only a couple of dozen or so !" returned the beauty, 
tulantly. 

Robert was obliged to laugh. 

" Hardly a single couple, I can assure you ! You know 
ho comes first upon the list, and would not dispute her 
ht. Then there is Aleck ! He is the only brother I 
live in the world." 

"And Miss Ruth is your only aunt; and mamma is 
elen's father's only sister, so she ought to come next; 
id Mam Becky is your only mammy, and Hero is your 
;st horse, and Dash your best dog and they all take pre- 
dence of a nobody like me, who has no claim upon you !" 
ied Lily, snatching at another rose, and bringing it away, 
Jem and all. "I don't thank you, or anybody else, for 
seventh, or even a third rate place in his regard. Thank 
podness ! if I am insignificant, I have too much pride for 



I "Don't try to pick a quarrel with me, little sister! I 
give enough sources of disquiet without this one disquiet 




which your sweet sympathy has done much to alleviate 
You wrong me by affecting to misunderstand my meaning. 
You know the sincerity of my attachment for you, Lily !" 

" Forgive me !" 

Her head fell upon his arm. Whether he would have
released himself from this position, or awaited the recovery 
of her composure, was not to be seen. 

" A letter for you, Miss Lily !" said Aleck's voice behind 
them. His face was stern his eye and accent penetrating 
" Your aunt was going to bring it in to you, and I tool 
charge of it to spare her the trouble." 

He bowed and withdrew, before either of the twain, 
whom his abrupt address had started, could find breath of
words for a reply.
