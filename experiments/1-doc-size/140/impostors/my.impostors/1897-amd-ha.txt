Miss Ludlow charming. She was not anxious now 
to have any of the Underhills on her visiting-list ; 
but she did mean to make use of Jim. She had 
grown quite worldly-wise and experienced. 

Two of Jim's friends were generously supplied 
with pocket-money. One was a young Virginian, 
Mr. Weir, the other, Harry Gaynor, and both spent 
lavishly. Flowers were costly then ; and Lily was 
the recipient of many a handsome bouquet. In 
return, she now and then gave a dainty supper, 
simple to be sure, or a card-party, with some de- 
lightful confections, and a little coffee or chocolate. 
Mrs. Nicoll always retired early, and took some 
drops to make sure of sleeping the first part of the 
night, so she was not easily disturbed. 

Then there were stars at the theatres. Parodi 
was emulating Jenny Lind, who had gone to 
Havana ; and the houses were crowded, if the tickets 
were not so high. It was so easy to spend money 
when an artful girl, with softest voice and bewitch- 
ing eyes, planned for you. And it was so easy to 
borrow, when you had good friends. 

Miss Lily looked carefully over her ground ; 

Harry Gaynor was gay and delightful, but one 
couldn't be quite sure he was not flirting. And 
though Mr. Weir had plenty of money, there was 
a large family of brothers and sisters, and they 
lived on an extensive plantation miles away from 
any considerable town. There was a Mr. Lewis, 
not so young, who had an interest in an old well- 
established leather firm that had been left him by 
an uncle. There were some non-eligibles. 

Mrs. Nicoll had said, in her caustic way : - 

" You make the most of your time, Lily Ludlow. 
I 'm past eighty, and you may find me dead in my 
bed some morning. I have not a stiver to leave 
any one ; so don't you count on that. I can hardly 
pay my own way." 

Still she had every luxury for herself; for years 
she had considered nothing but her own wants and 
indulgences. 

Poor Jim ! In his young mannishness he was 
quite sure there was no danger of falling in love ; 
of course such a thing would be wildest folly. 
But Lily was very fascinating and very flattering. 
She put it on the score of old friendship ; but, 
with a coquette's ardour, she did enjoy the young 
fellow's struggles to keep himself on a firm footing. 
And when he saw Gaynor's attentions, and listened 
to Weir's rhapsodies, a passion of boyish jealousy 
sprang up in his heart. 

Miss Lily kept her other admirers out of the 
way, except as she might meet them at dances or 
whist parties. She was not much in love with Mr. 



Lewis ; he was slow and really conceited, and, for 
a young man, rather careful of his money. If she 
only dared run the risk, and take Mr. Weir, who 
was to finish his college course in the summer ! 
And then arose a new star on her horizon. 

Mr. Williamson was forty and a widower ; but he 
drove an elegant pair of bays, belonged to a club, 
and had apartments at a hotel. She tried captivat- 
ing simplicity, and succeeded, to her great surprise, 
though she knew his habits were not irreproach- 
able. She had begged of Mr. Lewis a little time for 
consideration, when one morning Mr. Williamson 
astonished her by a call, and an offer of his hand 
and fortune. 

Miss Ludlow did not show her amazement, neither 
did she jump at the offer. She was very delicately 
surprised. Was he quite certain of his wishes? 
And - - it was so unexpected ! 

So certain indeed that he would bring her a 
ring that very afternoon, and take her out driv- 
ing,- - a man of his years not to know his own 
mind ! 

She could hardly believe her good fortune. For 
a fortnight she engineered her way skilfully, still 
keeping Mr. Lewis in reserve. And then she 
was convinced, and dismissed him. 

" Guess who is engaged?' Harry Gaynor cried, 
one morning. " I never was so beat in my life ! 
Jim, maybe this will hit you hard. Seems to me 
you Vc been rather distraught of late and sighing 
like a furnace." 

" These exams are enough to make any one sigh. 

 

And I am way behind. I must study day and 
night." 

" There are always engagements at this season, 
and weddings at Easter," returned Weir, laugh- 
; ngly. 

" That isn't guessing, Jim ! ' 

" Oh, bother ! What do I care? " 

" Then your charmer told you last night? ' : 

" My charmer? What are you driving at, 
Gaynor?' 

" Oh, how innocent ! Miss Lily Ludlow." 

" I 've met that Lewis there," returned Jim, with 
an air of bravado, though he flushed a little. " He 's 
a regular stick." 

" But it isn't Lewis. It 's that Gerald Williamson, 
a man about town. And the queer thing is that 
he thinks he has struck a fortune. Do you know, 
Jim? Is she to be the old lady's heir?' 

Jim was silent. What should he say? 

"Of course she is," said Weir. "That is I 
think it depends on whether Mrs. Nicoll approves 
of the marriage."
