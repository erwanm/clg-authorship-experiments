the tennis, and rowing received a new impetus 
since there were boats to hire. 

Poor Dick! How many times they said it. 
The boys did so with sincerest sympathy, 
though they admitted to each other, in very 
confidential moments, that he had led them 
into scrapes they were ashamed of now, and 
they wondered somewhat at their ready par- 
ticipation. 

“ I don’t go to a saloon any more, nor drink 
beer,” said Carl Benson. “ Old Woody gave 




us a great talking to about it — Dinsmore and 
Lang and me, — for it was quite noised about 
that Dick was 'way off that day, and he surely 
was. I used to chew cloves — I didn’t want 
Miss Grant to notice it. Boys, do you believe 
he really kissed her that day, or was it pure 
brag ? I am ashamed that we dared him to do 
it.” 

Almost a month later Mr. Underwood told 
the larger boys that Dick was allowed to see 
company and had wished for them. His arm 
was about well, but there had been an injury 
to the spine, and how bad it was the doctor 
could not quite tell. 

“ It’s best that he should have some diver- 
sion, they think, and he has begged to see some 
of you boys, so I said you would come.” 

“I’ll be mighty glad to!” exclaimed Carl. 
“ Poor old Dick ! ” 

“You and Larry then, and a day or two 
after White and Walter Lang.” 

The next morning Larry was at school early 
and went up to Miss Grant’s desk. 

“ Well,” she asked in a tone of soft inquiry, 
“ did you see your friend? ” 


 

“ Oh, Miss Grant ! ” and Larry tried to clear 
a bit of emotion out of his throat. “ Your 
heart would ache for him, I know. He was so 
robust and daring, and full of spirit and plans, 
and now he lies there white as a bit of marble, 
with great imploring dark eyes as if asking 
for help. And his hands are so thin now he 
couldn’t even hold a ball. His voice is so weak 
and tremulous,” and Larry winked very hard. 
He wouldn’t for worlds, in his boy’s pride, tell 
Miss Grant that they all cried together. 
“ And we told him about school and the plan 
for a senior class, and how we were studying.” 
Larry hurried lest there should be a break in 
his voice. “ He was so interested. Oh, Miss 
Grant, it’s been just awful for him to lie there 
alone day after day and not move about, when 
he was always so active. The nurse reads to 
him, and his father had a book rest made for 
him, so he can have papers and magazines 
about. But that’s not like real life, and the 
boys and school and play. And he was so in- 
terested in the boat club! He’s a real good 
oarsman. Its just dreadful ! ” 

“ It is, indeed,” in her sympathizing tone. 




“You boys must do all you can to cheer 
him.” 

The girls talked of “ poor Dick ” as well, 
but he seemed to have dropped out of the vital 
part of friendship. Of course they did not 
visit him. The mothers went occasionally. 
Mrs. Eastman came home quite restored, but 
she could talk of nothing except their great 
misfortune and her agonizing and inconsolable 
grief. 

The boys gave up pleasures for him, and 
now there were many delights for the splen- 
did afternoons. Were boys more chivalrous 
than girls? She had known a good deal about 
girls, their crudeness, their self-aggrandize- 
ment, their vanity, and littleness on many 
points. Boys of this age were a new study to 
her. Were they developing kindlier and more 
sympathetic traits from this sad mishap to one 
of their number? Larry had never been inso- 
lent and supercilious like Dick, but his rough- 
ness seemed curiously toned down. He was 
gentler now, and took more interest in the 
younger boys. 


CHAPTER XVII 


A SUCCESS AND A CONFESSION 

“ Oh, Miss Grant ! ” Georgia Winters ex- 
claimed one afternoon, when several of the 
girls had lingered to see the outcome of her 
plan that she had announced to them with 
great enthusiasm, indeed had arranged it in a 
most fascinating manner. “ Don’t you think 
we can have a commencement ? The high 
school at Newton is going to have a splendid 
one. A friend was over yesterday telling me 
all about it, and last evening after she went I 
began a poem. It was a sort of inspiration to 
me,” and the girl’s eyes shone with eagerness 
and a desire to distinguish herself. 

Helen was rather startled for a moment. 

“ Mr. Underwood will have to decide that. 
Or rather — I think we haven’t the right material. 
You see we should have some gradu- 
ates, and there will be only promotions. We 

have no honor pupils, no diplomas to distribute. 
No, it would not be a real commence- 
ment," and she smiled with a sort of winsome 
sympathy for their disappointment.
