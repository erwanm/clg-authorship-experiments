" Why, Hugh," said she, " where you going to get the 
money? " 



 

" It dan't make any difference where I get it. I'm 
going. 

" Besides," said Ellen, " your father needs you on the 
farm. You've got twice the strength Ben has. Your 
mother said so, one day when she's in." 

Hugh said nothing, but set his jaw. She moved 
slightly and he thought she was going and caught at a 
word to stay her. 

" What you going to do yourself? " 

" I'm going to be a stenographer," said Ellen. " Gris- 
sie is, too. We've been working together, and we do 
pretty well. And we've been practicing on that old type- 
writer the clerk in the bank gave her. Hugh ! " 

« Well," said Hugh. 

" What makes everybody like Grissie so.? " 

" They don't," said Hugh. " Not any way you'd call 
liking." 

" They do, too," said Ellen. She had wakened into an 
intense animation. " Everybody's crazy about her. 
The boys want to do things for her, and whatever she 
does is right." 

" I don't want to do things for her," said Hugh. " I 
shouldn't care if I never set eyes on her again." 

"Oh, well," said Ellen impatiently, "I didn't mean 
you. I meant the other boys. You don't count." 

Why didn't he coimt? He could never make her out. 
Her old cruelty smote him with a new misery. 

" Maybe I don't count," he said, at last, " not with 
you. But you'd ought to be ashamed of yourself, Ellen 
Brock, if I don't. Because you know what the reason is, 
and I do, too." 

Ellen was silent so long that he wondered if again she 
was beginning not to speak and realized that he never 
could bear that silence now. When she did speak it was 



 

in a small, almost a frightened, voice. Yet it was curious, 
too. 

" What is the reason? " 

" It's because you know I'm in love with you,'' said 
Hugh. " And you know I've made up my mind to marry 
you, and you know I'd die in my tracks to get you, and 
there's no way you could treat me that would stop my 
wanting you." 

Again she was silent, and then she struck her small 
fist on the bench so hard that he said involuntarily: 

" Oh, don't ! " 

He knew she had hurt the little hand. 

" Oh, how I hate it," said Ellen fiercely. " I hate it all. 
And I hate anybody that makes me think of it." 

"What.?" said Hugh. 

" Such things," she answered sulkily. " I thought I 
was going to have a nice time to-night, and now you — " 
She stopped, because, he knew, if she went on it would 
be half crying. 

And suddenly, out of the passion of his love for her, he 
leaped at an understanding of her like Larry Greene's. 
She was a little girl still, and he was troubling her with 
love before her time. He would have liked to comfort 
her in his own way, with soft words and deamesses; but 
he did not dare. 

" Don't -you mind," he said. He even laughed a little, 
to reassure her. " I know how you feel. You're not like 
Grissie. Lots of girls aren't. Everybody's in such an 
awful hurry to have girls grow up. I don't see what 
they're in such a rush for." 

" I want to grow up," said Ellen, still in that passion 
of fierceness, though now it seemed to him she was men- 
tally a little less aloof from him. " But I hate — such 
things." 



 

Hugh felt for the first time as if he held the key to her. 
Yet he had not heard of the stranger she dreamed about. 

" You don't have to think about 'em," he said. " Some- 
time you'll grow up. And you'll be married. But that's 
a long ways off." 

What she would have said, he wondered afterward, but 
he was quite sure that, if she had raged at him or scorned 
him, he could, by the force of his new knowledge of her, 
have calmed her and taken up their undisturbed friendli- 
ness a good pace further on. But the forces of the blindly 
working universe were against him: two figures ran out 
from the hall, one of them in white, and a light laugh 
rippled. They knew the laugh. Nobody but Grissie 
trilled that inexhaustible way. 

" Hold on," called the boy who raced after her. " Do 
you want to break a fellow's neck? " 

The voice, too, they knew. This was Ben. Grissie 
turned and in the moonlight they saw her run into his 
outstretched arms. To Ellen's angry eyes it seemed as 
if she doubled, not to escape but to be caught the sooner. 
And for an instant they stood there clasped while they 
kissed thirstily, and then Grissie's light laugh again 
chimed like silver bells. She was listening. 

" Somebody's there," they heard her say. " Under the 
old elm."
