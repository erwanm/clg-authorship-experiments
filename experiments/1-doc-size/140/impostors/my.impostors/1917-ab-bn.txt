groups. But there was one bitterest pang to come. As 



 

they entered the door, Grissie left Ben and fell back to 
Ellen's side. She spoke with caution, but Hugh caught 
the words: 

" Say, you and Hugh mad? Don't you speak? " 

He didn't know whether it was an added pain or a slight 
comfort that Ellen did not answer. She walked to her 
desk as if she had not heard. 

And every day it was the same. Hugh went beside her 
with the step of a soldier forced to march and the des- 
perate look of the soldier who knows himself foredoomed. 
Every morning he woke with the heaviness that lies wait- 
ing from a lasting misery, and whatever he did, even when 
he went to Larry's for his lesson, the nausea of grief was 
in the inmost part of him, Larry began to watch him
and decided, before the trees were bare, that he was fret- 
ting over his fiddle, and one night he said to him, when 
Hugh came in at the early dusk to ask a question about 
fingering: 

" Why don't you run away and have it over? " 

"Run away?" repeated Hugh. He looked at Larry 
in a brief surprise. " I don't want to run away." 

How could he run away and leave the question of his 
life unanswered, leave a silent Ellen too angry even to say 
good-by? 

" Well ! " said Larry. That was evidently not the way 
out. What other way was there? " I wish you'd go into 
Ardelia's," he said, at random, " and ask Ellen to fetch 
my bread." 

Hugh had risen to go. He stood there holding the top 
rail of a straight-backed chair and Larry saw his knuc- 
kles whiten and, needing to know the whole, ruthlessly 
lifted his gaze to the boy's face. It was as pale as if 
all the blood in him had been summoned to keep up his 
sick heart. Yet Hugh answered without emotion. 


" I can " said he. 

Then Larry knew, and answered cheerfully : 

" All right. I'll go up myself, this evening." 

Larry did go up, and, entering the yard softly, looked 
in at the window. Often, he knew, Ardelia left Ellen at 
her books and went neighboring at the Gleasons'. If 
Ardelia were here, he could not ask his question. Ellen 
was alone, sitting at the table, a pile of books before her 
and her pretty forehead tied into a studious frown. 
Larry called to her and then walked in, and she took his 
coming as a delightful happening and drew up another 
chair and told him to begin at once to scan her Latin. 
So he did, and they fell together into the rhythm, and 
sang it together and were most particularly happy, and 
Ellen's cheeks grew red with the fun of it and, for the min- 
ute, she forgot her father was not there. David hadn't 
known how to scan, but she always felt everything used 
to be easy when he was in the room, and this night, what 
with the snags she tripped over in her task, she had been 
minding his loss overwhelmingly. Larry raced through 
their pretty game in a scamper, for fear Ardelia would 
come before he did the deed he came for, and when they 
ended, he shut the book and asked : 

" Ellen, don't you speak to Hugh? " 

All the enchanting shine and life faded out of her face, 
and she answered with dignity, yet, Larry saw, sul- 
lenly : 

" No." 

" Why not? " asked Larry. 

And Ellen was as silent as she had been to Hugh. 
Larry leaned back in his chair and, while he looked at her, 
he drummed on the table with his hand, a distinctively 
handsome hand that played the violin. 

" Now," said he, " my lady, you needn't get sulky with 



 

me, because if you do, I'll take you up in my two hands 
and throw you over the moon." 

Ellen didn't look at him ; but he saw a little quirk of a 
smile trying to untie the muscles about her mouth, and 
he felt he had her. Besides, Ellen knew she was quite 
safe with him. He wouldn't touch her high mightiness 
with his two beautiful violin-playing hands. 

" Ellen," said Larry, drumming on the table, " you are 
a little prig." 

" What's a prig? " asked Ellen. 

" It's something with two feet and two hands and nice 
brown hair tied with a red ribbon." (Ellen had stopped 
doing up her hair when school began, because the girls 
laughed at her.) " It's something that gets mad and 
self-righteous if a boy wants to kiss 'em — " 

" I hate such things," flashed Ellen. 

" Well, but, my child," said Larry, gently, just as her 
father would have spoken, and Ellen thought of that, 
and choked, "if it's a decent chap like Hugh it only 
means your hair is so pretty and your eyes are so bright 
and you're such a dear — like a kitten, you know, or one 
of Smilie's puppies — he can't help it." 

Ellen did, in spite of her anchorite heart, like to be 
thought pretty, and was sure she never could be because 
her clothes were so plain. 

" You'd like to kiss Smilie's puppies. I've seen you do 
it. How would you like if it Smilie and I wouldn't speak 
to you? " 

"I suppose you want me to act like — " Here she 
stopped, not intending to be hateful about another girl. 
But he knew. 

" Like Grissie Gleason? " he asked. " No, I don't want
