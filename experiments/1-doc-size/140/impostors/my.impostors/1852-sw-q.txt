"Don't you now, cousin Seth?" said Fleda, shaking away her
tears and getting up.

"I ha'n't quite lost my recollection. Cousin, you must give me
a kiss. How do you do! You ha'n't forgot how to colour, I see,
for all you've been so long among the pale city folks."

"I hav'n't forgotten anything, cousin Seth," said Fleda,
blushing indeed, but laughing and shaking his hand with as
hearty good-will.

"I don't believe you have  anything that is good," said he.
"Where have you been all this while?"

"Oh, part of the time in New York, and part of the time in
Paris, and some other places."

"Well, you ha'n't seen anything better than Queechy, or
Queechy bread and butter, have you?"

"No, indeed!"

"Come, you shall give me another kiss for that," said he,
suiting the action to the word; "and now sit down and eat as
much bread and butter as you can. It's just as good as it used
to be. Come, mother, I guess breakfast is ready by the looks
of that coffee-pot."

"Breakfast ready!" said Fleda.

"Ay indeed; it's a good half-hour since it ought to ha' been
ready. If it aint, I can't stop for it. Them boys will be
running their furrows like sarpents if I aint there to start
them."

"Which like sarpents," said Fleda,  "the furrows or the men?"

"Well, I was thinking of the furrows," said he, glancing at
her. "I guess there aint cunning enough in the others to
trouble them. Come, sit down, and let me see whether you have
forgot a Queechy appetite."

"I don't know," said Fleda, doubtfully; "they will expect me
at home."

"I don't care who expects you  sit down! you aint going to
eat any bread and butter this morning but my mother's  you
haven't got any like it at your house. Mother, give her a cup
of coffee, will you, and set her to work."

Fleda was too willing to comply with the invitation, were it
only for the charm of old times. She had not seen such a table
for years, and little as the conventionalities of delicate
taste were known there, it was not without a comeliness of its
own in its air of wholesome abundance and the extreme purity
of all its arrangements. If but a piece of cold pork were on
aunt Miriam's table, it was served with a nicety that would
not have offended the most fastidious; and amid irregularities
that the fastidious would scorn, there was a sound excellence
of material and preparation that they very often fail to know.
Fleda made up her mind she would be wanted at home; all the
rather, perhaps, for Hugh's mysterious "hush;" and there was
something in the hearty kindness and truth of these friends
that she felt particularly genial. And if there was a lack of
silver at the board, its place was more than filled with the
pure gold of association. They sat down to table, but aunt
Miriam's eyes devoured Fleda. Mr. Plumfield set about his more
material breakfast with all despatch.

"So Mr. Rossitur has left the city for good?" said aunt
Miriam. "How does he like it?"

"He hasn't been here but a day, you know, aunt Miriam," said
Fleda evasively.

"Is he anything of a farmer?" asked her cousin.

"Not much," said Fleda.

"Is he going to work the farm himself?"

"How do you mean?"

"I mean, is he going to work the farm himself, or hire it out,
or let somebody else work it on shares?"

"I don't know," said Fleda  "I think he is going to have a
farmer, and oversee things himself."

"He'll get sick o' that," said Seth; "unless he's the luck to
get hold of just the right hand."

"Has he hired anybody yet?" said aunt Miriam, after a little
interval of supplying Fleda with "bread and butter."

"Yes, Ma'am, I believe so."

"What's his name?"

"Donohan  an Irishman, I believe; uncle Rolf hired him in New
York."

"For his head man?" said Seth, with a sufficiently
intelligible look.

"Yes," said Fleda. "Why?"

But he did not immediately answer her.

"The land's in poor heart now," said he, "a good deal of it;
it has been wasted; it wants first-rate management to bring it
in order, and make much of it for two or three years to come.
I never see an Irishman's head yet that was worth more than a
joke. Their hands are all of 'em that's good for anything."

"I believe uncle Rolf wants to have an American to go with
this man," said Fleda.

Seth said nothing; but Fleda understood the shake of his head
as he reached over after a pickle.

"Are you going to keep a dairy, Fleda?" said her aunt.

"I don't know, Ma'am  I haven't heard anything about it."

"Does Mrs. Rossitur know anything about country affairs?"

"No  nothing," Fleda said, her heart sinking perceptibly with
every new question.

"She hasn't any cows yet?"

She?  any cows!  But Fleda only said they had not come; she
believed they were coming.

"What help has she got?"

"Two women  Irishwomen," said Fleda.
