directly home, and I spent an hour on the Common, waiting for the fumes
of the wine I had drank to work off. When I went to Needham Street, I
found that Lilian was still out, probably purchasing her new black silk
dress. She came at last, and we ate a dried-up dinner at five o’clock.
She had purchased her dress, and was in the best of spirits.

The next day, when I went to the bank, I quietly transferred six
thousand dollars from my drawer to my pocket, with hardly a tithe of
the compunction with which I had appropriated my first loan. O, I
intended to be honest! The bank was not to lose a penny by me. For five
thousand of the money, Cormorin was to give me collateral worth ten
thousand in the market. With the other thousand I intended to pay my
uncle, and silence his carping for all time.

Cormorin was punctual in his call for his share of the funds. He handed
me the certificates and I gave him the money. In the course of the
forenoon Captain Halliard, faithful to his threat, paid me a visit.
I was not ready for him then, but I showed him one-half of Cormorin’s
certificates. They did not abate his persistency for payment of the
note, and I promised to pay him at three o’clock in the afternoon,
without fail. As I had the money in my pocket, I could safely make the
promise.

At the appointed time he presented himself before me.




CHAPTER XVII.

PROVIDING FOR THE WORST.


“THERE is your money, principal and interest,” said I to my uncle,
carelessly tossing him the bills. “You have compelled me to sacrifice
my coppers, but I am rid of you now.”

“Rid of me! It isn’t necessary for you to be impudent, Paley,” replied
the Captain.

“I assure you, it is a very great satisfaction for me to feel that
there is now no possible way in which you can annoy me.”

“I don’t want to annoy you.”

“I thought you did. You have been crowding me pretty hard. You have
compelled me to pay this note, for no other purpose than to annoy me.
You have done your worst, and I hope you are satisfied.”

“You may have the money again, if you want it,” said he; for, like
other bullies, when he felt that his power was gone, he was disposed to
make peace.

“I don’t want it now. I have sold out my stock at a loss to gratify
your malice. If you can do anything more to crush me, I hope you will
do it.”

“I don’t want to crush you. What are you talking about?” added my
uncle, impatiently.

“I don’t know what you mean by crowding me so hard, then.”

“Paley, you are living too fast. All I have done has been for your
good.”

“I don’t see it; and I don’t exactly know by what right you purpose
to take the management of my affairs into your own hands. You have
an offer for my house, and you have attempted to drive me out of it.
Let me say that I would go into bankruptcy, or into the State Prison,
before I would submit to any such dictation. I am of age and I think
I am able to take care of myself. I hear that Aunt Rachel is better
to-day, and is steadily improving. I shall take the first occasion to
tell her how you have used me.”

“Do you want to make trouble in the family?” asked he, evidently
startled by my threat; for the handling of the invalid’s property was
of some importance even to a gentleman of Captain Halliard’s wealth.

“I want justice done, though the heavens fall. Aunt Rachel never
intended that I should be driven up to pay this thousand dollars, as
you have done the business.”

“I did what I thought was best for you and for her.”

“All right; if you are satisfied, I am.”

I think my uncle was rather sorry he had crowded me so hard. He had
failed to accomplish his purpose of driving me out of my house, and he
knew that I had some influence with my aunt. He was disposed to back
out, but I was not willing that he should do so. I did not like the
idea of having him around me in the capacity of a guardian, prying into
my affairs, and listening to every breath of scandal that related to me.

The sharp words I had spoken produced some effect upon him. But it
occurred to me that his malice would be dangerous, and I did not
deem it prudent to provoke him any farther. He was intimate with Mr.
Bristlebach, and his influence might imperil my situation. It would
be utter ruin for me to be discharged before I had replaced the sums
I had “borrowed.” I moderated my wrath, therefore, and refrained from
enforcing my threat. My uncle left me, and I was willing to wait until
he made the next move.

I remained at the bank until half-past three o’clock, at which time I
had agreed to meet Cormorin, at Young’s. He was nearly half an hour
late, but he came, and I saw by his countenance that every thing
had gone well with him. I should say, in the light of subsequent
experience, that every thing had gone ill with him, for the successful
concealment of guilt, whatever consequences might follow its exposure,
is the greatest misfortune that can befall a man, inasmuch as it leads
him farther and deeper into crime.

“Five thousand; there are the identical bills you lent me,” said
Cormorin, as he laid the money upon the table before me. “I’m all right
now, and I hope I shall not have occasion to repeat this folly.”

“You will make enough by your operation in Ballyhacks to afford you a
sufficient capital for future operations.”

“That’s so. I shall be worth ten or fifteen thousand dollars next week,
as sure as I live. I am going to pay what I owe the bank, and then keep
square with the world. You have done me a good turn to-day, Glasswood,
and I am not one of the kind that forget such things.”

“Here are your certificates. I am glad to have been able to serve
you,” I replied, as I handed him the papers. “You said something about
another company in which a fellow might make a good thing.”

“I did—the Bustumup. Its stock’s going up just as that of the
Ballyhack did.”

“What can I have it for?”

“I am interested in this company, and if you take the stock at once you
shall have it for twenty, though it went at twenty-two to-day.”

“I will take two hundred and fifty shares of it.”

“You are sensible,” replied Cormorin. “You have the money in your fist,
and you can return it in a week or two, and put ten thousand dollars
into your pocket.”
