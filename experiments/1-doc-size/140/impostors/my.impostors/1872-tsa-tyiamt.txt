On the next day we had a large placard hung out 
bearing the words, " Free lunch from ten till twelve 
o clock." It consisted of fried liver cut into little 
pieces, and we gave each one who came in a small 
plate of this and a piece of bread, costing about a 
cent. Of course every one who took the lunch was 
expected to call for a glass of something to drink. 
One after another the men from the bindery and 
printing-office came in for the lunch, and some came 
twice within the two hours that we kept lunch on 
the counter, drinking both times. Boys came as 
well as men. The sight of these lads, some of them 
as young as twelve years, drinking beer with a sat 
isfied air, was not pleasant to me. I wished they 
would stay away. 

Soon after eleven o clock, John Ashley made his 
appearance. He came in almost stealthily. 

" Ah ! Good-day, John," said Lloyd, putting on 
a pleasant air. " I 've been looking for you all the 
morning. Let me make you up a nice lunch ;" and 
he filled a plate heaping full and gave it to him, add 
ing a large piece of bread. 

" Thank you ! That 's splendid. I'm pretty sharp 
this morning. You see, I was a little late getting 

 



 

down to breakfast, and the old gentleman hurried 
me off to work before I was half through. A glass 
of beer, if you please." 

Lloyd drew the beer and set it before him. John 
ate and drank hastily, so as to get back before his 
father missed him. 

" He 'd give me fits if he caught me here," was his 
remark as he set down his empty glass and paid his 
ten cents. 

" Call round in the evening some time," said 
Lloyd, in his blandest way. "We had some nice 
people here last night." 

" Thank you ! Maybe I will ;" and the lad hur 
ried off. 

In the evening he came in a little after eight 
o clock. Lloyd was very gracious to him, and John 
was pleased and flattered by the attention. 

" How are you getting on ?" he asked. 

" Elegantly," was replied. " Our friends have 
rallied about us strong. We count you among the 
number, of course." 

" Thank you," said John. " Oh yes, you may 
count on me, only, as you know, Lloyd, I shall have 
to fight a little shy. A glass of ale, if you please. It 
wouldn 't just do for the old gentleman to know I 
come here, Where are you going, John ? he asked 
to-night, and he looked at me sharply. I said, 
Only round to Mr. Oram s. I don 't  think he half 
believed me." . 

" Bully for you !" cried a journeyman printer who 





was standing near, and he slapped John familiarly 
on the shoulder. 

" He 's a brick," chimed in another. 

Lloyd smiled approvingly, and the weak lad, 
pleased at their rough compliments, drank off his 
ale with as manly an air as he could assume. 

" Your friend Joe Wilson 's up stairs," said Lloyd 
as John, after drinking his ale, stood leaning on the 
counter. 

" Is he ?" a pleased expression lighting up his 
face. " Which way do you go ?" 

" I 'll show you ;" and Lloyd took him through a 
door that led into the entry and up to the second- 
story back-building, where we had two rooms fitted 
up for little parties of two, three or four who liked 
to have a social hour to themselves and be out of 
common observation. There was a private entrance 
to these, so that any person who did not wish to be 
seen coming through the bar could get in without 
attracting notice. 

Joe Wilson, mentioned incidentally before, was 
about twenty years of age. Both he and his father 
worked in Harvey st, and both of them drank too 
much. The father was one of your old, regular 
drinkers who has to keep his nerves well strung 
with beer or spirits daily in order to hold them 
steady enough for work. Twice within a year had 
these over-stimulated nerves refused to come up to 
time, and then mania seized him. His last attack 
had been unusually severe, and wellnigh finished 



 

him. We did not see him at the bindery for over a 
week. 

He and old Jacobs the pressman were drinking 
cronies, and both of them had been pretty mellow 
on the night before our opening night not going 
home until after eleven o clock. Joe had come in 
soon after his father. When the old man saw him, 
his countenance fell. I was looking at him just 
then, and noticed the change. He got up, and cross 
ing the room, met his son not far from the door. 
They stood for a little while talking in low tones. 
Once or twice I heard an impatient word from Joe, 
and then this sentence : 

" Tisn 't any use to talk, father! I can t stay 
home, and if I don 't  come here, I 'll go somewhere 
else." 

The argument ended. Wilson came back and sat 
down with Jacobs, and Joe asked a fellow-workman
