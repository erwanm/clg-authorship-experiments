                             *NON SEQUITUR*


Silvette dropped into an armchair, crossed her knees, and sat swinging
her foot and gazing through the open window in silence until Diana’s
head, lifted from time to time in smiling interrogation, could be no
longer ignored.

"Jack Rivett has asked me to marry him," she said in an expressionless
voice.

Diana laughed in frank surprise:

"That infant!"

"Yes."

"What an absurdity!"

Her sister said nothing.

"How did it come—out of a clear sky?"

"Yes....  I knew he liked me.  I had no idea he wanted to marry me."

"You’re not going to, are you?"

"No."

"I should think not.  It would be sheer cradle snatching."

"He’s a year older than I am."

"In years, yes; but, intellectually, he ought to be playing marbles.
Moreover, that sort of a boy never grows up."

"I don’t think he will....  God bestows that gift sometimes."

"What gift?"

"The gift of eternal youth....  I haven’t it....  But I believe it can
be shared."  She gazed thoughtfully at the distant hills. "Years and
years slip from me when that boy and I talk nonsense together."

"Better talk sense with him, and wake up, sweetness, or you’ll relapse
into your second childhood."

"I have just been talking sense to him.... I’m awake," she said
dreamily.

"Do you mean to admit that the interview has seriously affected you?"

"Oh, I don’t know yet."

"Better investigate," said Diana.  "You know what his parents expect of
their children. And if we are to remain here, I think, dear, that you
had better see a little less of Jack Rivett than you have been seeing.
Don’t you?"

"I am sure of it."

"Otherwise," continued Diana calmly, "it would be playing the game
fairer for you and me to seek another business engagement. These people
have been very honorable toward us.  We can scarcely permit them to
outdo us."

Silvette looked up calmly, her cheek resting on her hand.

"How dishonorable would it be?" she asked.

"What?"

"To—let him fall in love with me?"

"Ask yourself.  You know their social ambitions."

"I know; but, after all, you and I started out to make of life a
successful business proposition.  I thought a desirable marriage was to
be part of the programme."

"Do you consider Jack Rivett desirable? He could take you nowhere.  With
all his wealth, where could you take him?  And anyway, it’s not playing
the game, Silvie.  It’s kidnaping."  She laughed.  "Take a man of your
size—and of the world, little sister; and if he isn’t of the world, and
is poor, defy him to take you!—give him battle—put up a good fight
with foot, horse, and artillery.  The best one of you will always win,
and the other get what’s coming."

Silvette went to the desk, supplied herself with pen and paper, and
prepared to resume her interrupted correspondence.  Presently she looked
around, pen poised.



"Did the best man win between you and Jim Edgerton?" she asked.

Diana bent lower over her sewing.

"I’m afraid so, Silvie."

"Then you won."

"I think so....  I have fought it over every day since—alone."

"You poor little thing," said Silvette softly.

Diana looked up with a slight smile.  "Perhaps you misunderstood me,
dear.  I told you I was winning....  Which means, I think, that Jim
Edgerton isn’t going to remain very long at Adriutha."

"Where is he going?"

"I don’t know that he is going at all; he doesn’t know it, either....
But, somehow, I dare believe that he is going."

"Where?"

"Into a man’s world to engage in a man’s business."

"It isn’t in him, Diana....  You are taking a great responsibility on
your shoulders. Do you realize that you are?"

"Yes."

"And that a man with no more force of character and real ability than he
has may starve?  That the world will probably break his heart, anyway."

"Let it, then....  Only a real man’s heart breaks.  I’ll know he’s one
if it does; and so will he.  And that’s worth all the rest."

"That’s a stern creed, little sister, considering the pleasure-loving
lips that utter it."

"Out of the mouth of fools, wisdom.  It doesn’t matter what I am.  The
thing that is important is what he shall become."
