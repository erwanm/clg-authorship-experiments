about it." 



 

" Won't you walk in and take some breakfast with 
us ? " asked Mrs. Alston. " You ought to have a good 
appetite for it." 

" O, I had it, fifteen minutes ago, appetite and 
all ; but thank you all the same. The girls want to 
come over this afternoon, Kathie, if you were not 
going anywhere. And could we have the boat out 
a while ? " 

Kathie glanced at her mother with an odd smile. 

" How many ? " asked Mrs. Alston. 

" O, Mary and Till, and the Gardiner girls, and 
Carry Jelliffe, and two or three of us boys. Mary 
thought it would be nice before before you had 
company," exclaimed Harry, blushing. 

" Mary and Lucy and Annie were to come to tea. 
mamma, can't we have them all ? " and Kathie 
glanced up entreatingly. 

" But the company ? " said Uncle Kobert, in a low 
tone. 

Kathie's thoughts recurred to her last evening's 
conversation. Would it not be rather foolish and 
selfish to disappoint the gay little party for the 
sake of one ? 

" Well, Kathie ? " 



 

" O mamma, I should like to have them come." 

"Very well. Harry, tell them that we shall be 
very glad to see them all, and that we shall expect 
them to stay to supper. And you boys as well." 

Harry nodded, with graceful satisfaction. 

" And come early," appended Kathie. " Give my 
love to them." 

" Now you must tell Hannah as soon as you are 
through, and decide what it would be nice to have ; 
for I am afraid a little cream and sponge-cake will 
not be just the thing for a hungry troop." 

Before breakfast was ended they had another call. 
Little Dolly Maybin ran over to see " if Janie might 
come home to-day. Mother was sick in bed, and 
Martha had a sore finger." 

" It will be rather bad to spare her to-day, still, I 
suppose she ought to go." 

" yes," said Kathie. " I can help, and there 
won't be so very much to do." 

" If she will come back early." 

Jane was in something of a flurry when she heard 
it. Mrs. Maybin had been ailing for a week or ten 
days. Threatened with a fever, Jane thought. And 
if she should have a long illness 



 

' Never mind ; we will not worry until it happens," 
said Mrs. Alston. " Come back by five, and let us 
know how she is. Then, after supper is through, you 
may return." 

Kathie ran out to the kitchen. " We are going to 
have a surprise-party, Hannah," she said, " only they 
do not bring their eatables along. And Jane has had 
to go home to her sick mother." 

" How large a party ? ' and Hannah held up her 
skimmer, as she was improving her spare moments 
by doing blackberries. 

" O, four or five girls, and as many boys maybe. 
But we don't need to make any great time." 

" I was going to do preserves all the morning," said 
Hannah, who gave the possible objections first and 
the cheerful willingness afterward. 

"I can make the cake and some jelly; and, 
mamma, may we have cream ? Uncle Robert will 
see to that, I know." 

" Yes, if he chooses. Kathie may as well make the 
cake this morning, Hannah, but wait until Ada has 
had her breakfast." 

" And the bread and biscuit ? " said Hannah. " We 
had just about enough to last over till to-morrow." 



 

" The biscuits may as well be cold, as they are 
really better for the children." 

" Why, I can make them too. It will seem quite 
like old times. I haven't done any kitchen work in 
ever so long." 

Kathie cleared the "pastry-table," and began to 
bring out some materials. 

"You had better put your room in order," said 
her mother, " and then you will have the whole 
morning." 

So Kathie ran up stairs. The bed had been airing 
in the morning sunshine, so she spread it up and 
dusted, and brought in a few fresh flowers. At that 
juncture Ada called. 

" I have had such a lovely sleep ! " she exclaimed. 

JL suppose you have been up an hour or two, and 
you look as bright as a rose. Dear, if I ever could
