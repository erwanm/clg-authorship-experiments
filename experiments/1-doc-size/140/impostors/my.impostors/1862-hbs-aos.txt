Rome the horses which had been used to convey part of the suite of a
nobleman traveling to Naples, to give them a quicker passage across
than they could have made on foot. It is true that this was quite
contrary to the wishes of Agnes, who felt that the journey ought to be
performed in the most toilsome and self-renouncing way, and that they
should trust solely to prayer and spiritual protection to ward off the
pestilential exhalations.

In vain she quoted the Psalm, "Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at
noon-day," and adduced cases of saints who had walked unhurt through
all sorts of dangers.

"There's no use talking, child," said Elsie. "I'm older than you, and
have seen more of real men and women; and whatever they did in old
times, I know that nowadays the saints don't help those that don't take
care of themselves; and the long and the short of it is, we must ride
across those marshes, and get out of them as quick as possible, or we
shall get into Paradise quicker than we want to."

In common with many other professing Christians, Elsie felt that going
to Paradise was the very dismalest of alternatives,--a thing to be
staved off as long as possible.

After many days of journeying, the travelers, somewhat weary and
foot-sore, found themselves in a sombre and lonely dell of the
mountains, about an hour before the going down of the sun. The
slanting yellow beams turned to silvery brightness the ashy foliage
of the gnarled old olives, which gaunt and weird clung with their
great, knotty, straggling roots to the rocky mountain-sides. Before
them, the path, stony, steep, and winding, was rising upward and still
upward, and no shelter for the night appeared, except in a distant
mountain-town, which, perched airily as an eagle's nest on its hazy
height, reflected from the dome of its church and its half-ruined
old feudal tower the golden light of sunset. A drowsy-toned bell was
ringing out the Ave Maria over the wide purple solitude of mountains,
whose varying outlines were rising around.

"You are tired, my little heart," said old Elsie to Agnes, who had
drooped during a longer walk than usual.

"No, grandmamma," said Agnes, sinking on her knees to repeat her
evening prayer, which she did, covering her face with her hands.

Old Elsie kneeled too; but, as she was praying,--being a thrifty
old body in the use of her time,--she cast an eye up the steep
mountain-path and calculated the distance of the little airy village.
Just at that moment she saw two or three horsemen, who appeared to be
stealthily observing them from behind the shadow of some large rocks.

When their devotions were finished, she hurried on her grandchild
saying,--

"Come, dearie! it must be we shall find a shelter soon."

The horsemen now rode up behind them.

"Good-evening, mother!" said one of them, speaking from under the
shadow of a deeply slouched hat.

Elsie made no reply, but hurried forward.

"Good-evening, pretty maid!" he said again, riding still nearer.

"Go your ways in the name of God," said Elsie. "We are pilgrims, going
for our souls to Rome; and whoever hinders us will have the saints to
deal with."

"Who talks of hindering you, mother?" responded the other. "On the
contrary, we come for the express purpose of helping you along."

"We want none of your help," said Elsie, gruffly.

"See, now, how foolish you are!" said the horseman. "Don't you see that
that town is a good seven miles off, and not a bit of bed or supper to
be had till you get there, and the sun will be down soon? So mount up
behind me, and here is a horse for the little one."

In fact, the horsemen at this moment opening disclosed to view a
palfrey with a lady's saddle, richly caparisoned, as if for a person
of condition. With a sudden movement, two of the men dismounted,
confronted the travelers, and the one who had acted as spokesman,
approaching Agnes, said, in a tone somewhat imperative,--

"Come, young lady, it is our master's will that your poor little feet
should have some rest."

And before Agnes could remonstrate, he raised her into the saddle as
easily as if she had been a puff of thistledown, and then turning to
Elsie, he said,--

"For you, good mother, if you wish to keep up, you must e'en be content
with a seat behind me."

"Who are you? and how dare you?" said Elsie, indignantly.

"Good mother," said the man, "you see God's will is that you should
submit, because we are four to you two, and there are fifty more within
call. So get up without more words, and I swear by the Holy Virgin no
harm shall be done you."

Elsie looked and saw Agnes already some distance before her, the bridle
of her palfrey being held by one of the horsemen, who rode by her side
and seemed to look after her carefully; and so, without more ado, she
accepted the services of the man, and, placing her foot on the toe of
his riding-boot, mounted to the crupper behind him.

"That is right," said he. "Now hold on to me lustily, and be not
afraid."

So saying, the whole troop began winding as rapidly as possible up the
steep, rocky path to the mountain-town.

Notwithstanding the surprise and alarm of this most unexpected
adventure, Agnes, who had been at the very point of exhaustion from
fatigue, could not but feel the sensation of relief and repose which
the seat in an easy saddle gave her. The mountain air, as they rose,
breathed fresh and cold on her brow, and a prospect of such wondrous
beauty unrolled beneath her feet that her alarm soon became lost in
admiration. The mountains that rose everywhere around them seemed to
float in a transparent sea of luminous vapor, with olive-orchards
and well-tilled fields lying in far, dreamy distances below, while
out towards the horizon silver gleams of the Mediterranean gradually
widened to the view. Soothed by the hour, refreshed by the air, and
filled with admiration for the beauty of all she saw, she surrendered
herself to her situation with a feeling of solemn religious calm, as
to some unfolding of the Divine Will, which might unroll like the
landscape beneath her. They pursued their way in silence, rising higher
and higher out of the shadows of the deep valleys below, the man who
conducted them observing a strict reserve, but seeming to have a care
for their welfare.

The twilight yet burned red in the sky, and painted with solemn lights
the mossy walls of the little old town, as they plunged under a
sombre antique gateway, and entered on a street as damp and dark as a
cellar, which went up almost perpendicularly between tall, black stone
walls that seemed to have neither windows nor doors. Agnes could only
remember clambering upward, turning short corners, clattering down
steep stone steps, under low archways, along narrow, ill-smelling
