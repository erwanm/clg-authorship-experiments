ciation for Ameliorating the Condition of some 
body here at home. Any one can belong to 
it by paying a dollar, and for twenty dollars one 



 

can become a life Ameliorator, a sort of life 
assurance. The Mistress, at the meeting, I 
believe, " seconded the motion " several times, 
and is one of the Vice-Presidents ; and this fam 
ily honor makes me feel almost as if I were a 
president of something myself. These little dis 
tinctions are among the sweetest things in life, 
and to see one's name officially printed stimu 
lates his charity, and is almost as satisfactory as 
being the chairman of a committee or the mover 
of a resolution. It is, I think, fortunate, and not 
at all discreditable, that our little vanity, which 
is reckoned among our weaknesses, is thus made 
to contribute to the activity of our nobler powers. 
Whatever we may say, we all of us like distinc 
tion ; and probably there is no more subtle flat 
tery than that conveyed in the whisper, " That 's 
he," "That's she." 

There used to be a society for ameliorating 
the condition of the Jews ; but they were found 
to be so much more adept than other people in 
ameliorating their own condition that I suppose 
it was given up. Mandeville says that to his 
knowledge there are a great many people who 



Il 

get up ameliorating enterprises merely to be con 
spicuously busy in society, or to earn a little 
something in a good cause. They seem to think 
that the world owes them a living because they 
are philanthropists. In this Mandeville does not 
speak with his usual charity. It is evident that 
there are Jews, and some Gentiles, whose condi 
tion needs ameliorating, and if very little is really 
accomplished in the effort for them, it always 
remains true that the charitable reap a ben 
efit to themselves. It is one of the beautiful 
compensations of this life that no one can sin 
cerely try to help another without helping 
himself. 

OUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR. Why is it that 
almost all philanthropists and reformers are dis 
agreeable ? 

I ought to explain who our next-door neighbor 
is. He is the person who comes in without 
knocking, drops irr in the most natural way, as 
his wife does also, and not seldom in time to 
take the after-dinner cup of tea before the fire. 
Formal society begins as soon as you lock your 
doors, and only admit visitors through the media 



 

of bells and servants. It is lucky for us that our 
next-door neighbor is honest. 

THE PARSON. Why do you class reformers 
and philanthropists together ? Those usually 
called reformers are not philanthropists at all. 
They are agitators. Finding the world disagree 
able to themselves, they wish to make it as 
unpleasant to others as possible. 

MANDEVILLE. That 's a noble view of your 
fellow-men. 

OUR NEXT DOOR. Well, granting the distinc 
tion, why are both apt to be unpleasant people 
to live with ? 

THE PARSON. As if the unpleasant people 
who won't mind their own business were confined 
to the classes you mention ! Some of the best 
people I know are philanthropists, I mean the 
genuine ones, and not the uneasy busybodies 
seeking notoriety as a means of living. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. It is not altogether the 
not minding their own business. Nobody does 
that. The usual explanation is, that people with 
one idea are tedious. But that is not all of it. 
For few persons have more than one idea, 




ministers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, manufac 
turers, merchants, they all think the world 
they live in is the central one. 

MANDEVILLE. And you might add authors. 
To them nearly all the life of the world is in 
letters, and I suppose they would be astonished 
if they knew how little the thoughts of the 
majority of people are occupied with books, 
and with all that vast thought-circulation which 
is the vital current of the world to book-men. 
Newspapers have reached their present power by 
becoming unliterary, and reflecting all the inter 
ests of the world. 

THE MISTRESS. I have noticed one thing, that 
the most popular persons in society are those 
who take the world as it is, find the least fault, 
and have no hobbies. They are always wanted 
to dinner. 

THE YOUNG LADY. And the other kind 
always appear to me to want a dinner. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. It seems to me that the 
real reason why reformers and some philanthro 
pists are unpopular is, that they disturb our 
serenity and make us conscious of our own short- 



 

comings. It is only now and then that a whole 
people get a spasm of reformatory fervor, of 
investigation and regeneration. At other times 
they rather hate those who disturb their quiet.
