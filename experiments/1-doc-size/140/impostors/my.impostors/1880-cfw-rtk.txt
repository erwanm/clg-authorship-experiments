too would let Eliot go. But there was not much time for 
thought. 

Brother Bethuel brought out some apples, and began to 
converse easily with his visitor. After a while he said, depre- 
catingly : 

" Will you not remove your pistols to the window-seat 
behind you, Mr. Royce ? From my youth, I could never 
abide the proximity of fire-arms of any kind. They distress 
me." 

Royce good-naturedly took them out of his belt, and 
placed them behind him, but within easy reach. The mis 
sionary was on the opposite side of the room. 

Not a sound below. Wainwright was breathing with his 
mouth wide open, so as not to pant. He was still much 
spent. 

But it could not last long ; Royce felt that he must search 
the house, even at the risk of offending the little mission 
ary. 

" Mr. Head," he said, awkwardly enough, " I am very 
sorry, but but a communication has been received stating 
that one of the outlaws, and the one, too, who shot poor 
Allison, is concealed here, in this house. I am very sorry, 
but but I must search ever)- part of it immediately." 

Brother Bethuel had risen ; his countenance expressed 
sorrow and surprise. 

" Young man," he said, " search where and as you please I 
but spare me your suspicions." 

There was a dignity in his bearing which Royce had not 
seen before ; he felt hot and ashamed. 

"Indeed, Mr. Head, I regret all this," he said; "and, of 
course, it is but a matter of form. Still, for my own satis 
faction, and yours, too, now I must go through the house." 

He rose and moved a step forward. Quick as lightning 
the little missionary had sprung behind him, and pushed the 
pistols over the sill, through the open window, down forty 
feet on the rocks below. 





" Traitor ! " cried Royce, grappling him. 

But it was too late ; the pistols were gone. Brother Beth- 
uel glowed openly with triumph ; he made no more resistance 
in Royce's strong arms than a rag. The young man soon 
dropped him, and, hearing a sound below, ran to the cellar- 
door. 

" He has no pistols ! " screamed Bethuel down the stair 
after him : " you can manage him ; he is alone." 

Then, setting all the doors wide open, so that escape 
would be easy, he ran out to saddle Marcher. 

Down below, in the cellar, Stephen had caught hold of 
Royce's arm. Royce, full in the narrow entranceway, stood 
glaring at Eliot, and minding Stephen's hold no more than 
the foot of a fly. The light from the horizontal door above 
streamed in and showed Eliot's dark face and Honor's dilated 
eyes. The girl stood near her cousin, but slightly behind him 
as though she feared his gaze. 

" You are the man I want," said Royce ; " I recognize 
you ! " His strong voice came in among their previous whis 
pers and bated breath, as his face came in among their three 
faces Honor's ivory-pallid cheeks, the outlaw's strained at 
tention, and Stephen's gray fatigue, more and more visible 
now as he gained breath and sight. "Yield yourself up. 
We are two to your one." 

" We are two to your one," answered Eliot : " that man 
beside you is for me." 

Royce looked down with surprise upon his cousin, who 
still held his arm. 

" No mistaken lenity now, Stephen," he said curtly, shak 
ing his arm free. " I must have this man ; he shot Allison." 

" How are you going to do it ?" said Eliot jeeringly, put 
ting his hands deep down in his pockets and squaring his 
shoulders. " Even Honor here is a match for two Yan 
kees." 

" Miss Dooris, I will let you pass," said Royce impatiently.
" Go up stairs. This is no place for a girl like you." 





" Say lady ! " cried Eliot. " She is a Southern lady, sir ! " 

" Bah ! " said Royce ; " you are a fine person to talk of 
ladies. Are you going, Miss Dooris ? " 

Great tears stood in Honor's eyes ; she did not stir. 

" She will not go, John," said Wainwright, " because that 
man is her cousin he is an Eliot." 

" He is a murderer ! " said Royce, filling up the doorway 
again, and measuring with his eye the breadth of his oppo 
nent's shoulders and muscle. " Now, then, are you with me 
or against me, Stephen ? If against me, by Heaven ! I will 
fight you both." 

" You do not understand, John. It is Honor's cousin : 
that is why / am anxious to save him." 

" And what is her cousin or anybody's cousin to me ? " 
cried Royce angrily. " I tell you that man shot Allison, and 
he shall swing for it." 

He sprang forward as if to close with Eliot, then sprang 
back again. He remembered that it was more important 
that he should guard the door : there was no other way of 
escape. If Stephen, pursuing the extraordinary course he 
had taken in this matter, should side with Eliot, Brother 
Bethuel being a traitor too up stairs, he might not be able to 
overcome the outlaw in an attack. He set his teeth, there 
fore, and stood still. His hat was off ; the sunset light touched 
his forehead and yellow hair ; the image of strength and 
young manhood, he confronted them in his elegant attire 
confronted the outlaw in his rough, unclean garments ; Honor 
in her old, black gown ; and Stephen in his torn clothes, his 
tired face looking yellow and withered as the face of an old 
baboon. He considered whether he could keep the door un
