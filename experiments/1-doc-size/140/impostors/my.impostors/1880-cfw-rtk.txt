story. Cousin Copeland shook his head many times during 




the recital. He had not the bitter feelings of Miss Margaretta 
concerning the late war ; in fact, he had never come down 
much farther than the Revolution, having merely skirmished 
a little, as it were, with the war of 1812 ; but he knew his 
cousin's opinions, and respected their memory. So he " ear 
nestly hoped " that some other site would be selected for the 
camp. Upon being told that the blue army-wagons had al 
ready arrived, he then " earnestly hoped " that the encamp 
ment would not be of long continuance. Cousin Copeland 
had hoped a great many things during his life ; his capacity 
for hoping was cheering and unlimited ; a hope carefully 
worded and delivered seemed to him almost the same thing 
as reality ; he made you a present of it, and rubbed his little 
hands cheerfully afterward, as though now all had been said. 

" Do you think I should have asked them in ? " said Gar- 
dis, hesitatingly. 

" Most certainly, most certainly. Hospitality has ever 
been one of our characteristics as a family," said Cousin 
Copeland, finishing the last spoonful of milk, which had come 
out exactly even with the last little square of corn-bread. 

" But I did not ask them." 

" Do I hear you aright ? You did not ask them, Cousin 
Gardiston ? " said the little bachelor, pausing gravely by the 
table, one hand resting on its shining mahogany, the other 
extended in the attitude of surprise. 

" Yes, Cousin Copeland, you do. But these are officers of 
the United States army, and you know Aunt Margaretta's 
feelings regarding them." 

" True," said Cousin Copeland, dropping his arm ; " you 
are right ; I had forgotten. But it is a very sad state of 
things, my dear very sad. It was not so in the old days at 
Gardiston House : then we should have invited them to din 
ner." 

" We could not do that," said Gardis thoughtfully, " on 
account of forks and spoons ; there would not be enough to 
go But I would not invite them anyway," she added, the 



color rising in her cheeks, and her eyes flashing. " Are they 
not our enemies, and the enemies of our country ? Vandals ? 
Despots ? " 

"Certainly," said Cousin Copeland, escaping from these 
signs of feminine disturbance with gentle haste. Long be 
fore, he was accustomed to remark to a bachelor friend that 
an atmosphere of repose was best adapted to his constitution 
and to his work. He therefore now retired to the first wife 
of the second cousin of his grandfather, and speedily forgot 
all about the camp and the officers. Not so Gardis. Putting 
on her straw hat, she went out into the garden to attend to 
her flowers and work off her annoyance. Was it annoyance, 
or excitement merely ? She did not know. But she did know 
that the grove was full of men and tents, and she could see 
several of the blue-coats fishing in the river. "Very well," 
she said to herself hotly ; " we shall have no dinner, then ! " 
But the river was not hers, and so she went on clipping the 
roses, and tying back the vines all the long bright afternoon, 
until old Dinah came to call her to dinner. As she went, the 
bugle sounded from the grove, and she seemed to be obeying 
its summons ; instantly she sat down on a bench to wait until 
its last echo had died away. " I foresee that I shall hate that 
bugle," she said to herself. 

The blue-coats were encamped in the grove three long 
months. Captain Newell and the lieutenant, Roger Saxton, 
made no more visits at Gardiston House ; but, when they 
passed by and saw the little mistress in the garden or at the 
window, they saluted her with formal courtesy. And the 
lieutenant looked back ; yes, there was no doubt of that the 
lieutenant certainly looked back, Saxton was a handsome 
youth ; tall and finely formed, he looked well in his uniform, 
and knew it. Captain Newell was not so tall a gray-eyed, 
quiet young man. " Commonplace," said Miss Gardis. The 
bugle still gave forth its silvery summons. " It is insupport 
able," said the little mistress daily ; and daily Cousin Copeland 
replied, " Certainly." But the bugle sounded on all the same. 




One day a deeper wrath came. Miss Duke discovered 
Dinah in the act of taking cakes to the camp to sell to the 
soldiers ! 

" Well, Miss Gardis, dey pays me well for it, and we's 
next to not ing laid up for de winter," replied the old woman 
anxiously, as the irate little mistress forbade the sale of so 
much as " one kernel of corn." 

" Dey don't want de corn, but dey pays well for de cakes, 
dearie Miss Gardis. Yer see, yer don't know not ing about 
it ; it's only ole Dinah makin a little money for herself and 
Pomp," pleaded the faithful creature, who would have given 
her last crumb for the family, and died content. But Gardis 
sternly forbade all dealings with the camp from that time 
forth, and then she went up to her room and cried like a child. 
" They knew it, of course," she thought ; " no doubt they 
have had many a laugh over the bakery so quietly carried on 
at Gardiston House. They are capable of supposing even 
that /sanctioned it." And with angry tears she fell to plan 
ning how she could best inform them of their mistake, and 
overwhelm them with her scorn. She prepared several crush 
ing little speeches, and held them in reserve for use ; but the 
officers never came to Gardiston House, and of course she 
never went to the camp no, nor so much as looked that way ; 
so there was no good opportunity for delivering them. One 
night, however, the officers did come to Gardiston House 
not only the officers, but all the men ; and Miss Duke was 
very glad to see them. 

It happened in this way. The unhappy State had fallen 
into the hands of double-faced, conscienceless whites, who 
used the newly enfranchised blacks as tools for their evil pur 
poses. These leaders were sometimes emigrant Northerners, 
sometimes renegade Southerners, but always rascals. In the 
present case they had inflamed their ignorant followers to 
riotous proceedings in the city, and the poor blacks, fancying 
that the year of jubilee had come, when each man w;&gt;s to 
have a plantation, naturally began by ejecting the resident 




owners before the grand division of spoils. At least this was 
their idea. During the previous year, when the armies were 
still marching through the land, they had gone out now and 
then in a motiveless sort of way and burned the fine planta
