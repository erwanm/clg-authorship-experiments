TAPIOCA BLANC-MANGE. 

    ½ lb. tapioca, soaked in a cup of cold water four hours.
    1 pint rich new milk.
    ¾ cup of sugar.
    2 teaspoonfuls bitter almond or vanilla essence.
    A little salt.

Heat the milk, and stir in the soaked tapioca. When it has dissolved,
add the sugar. Boil slowly fifteen minutes, stirring all the time; take
from the fire, and beat until nearly cold. Flavor and pour into a mould
dipped in cold water. Turn out, and pour cold sweetened cream around it.


SAGO BLANC-MANGE.

May be made in the same way as tapioca.


CORN-STARCH BLANC-MANGE. 

    1 quart of milk.
    4 tablespoonfuls corn-starch, wet in a little cold water.
    3 eggs, well beaten—whites and yolks separately.
    1 cup of sugar.
    Vanilla, lemon, or other essence.
    1 saltspoonful salt.

Heat the milk to boiling; stir in the corn-starch and salt, and boil
together five minutes (in a farina-kettle), then add the yolks, beaten
light, with the sugar; boil two minutes longer, stirring all the while;
remove the mixture from the fire, and beat in the whipped whites while
it is boiling hot. Pour into a mould wet with cold water, and set in a
cold place. Eat with sugar and cream.


FARINA BLANC-MANGE

Is made according to the above receipt, but boiled fifteen minutes
before the eggs are added. You may omit the eggs if you like, and only
want a plain dessert.


ARROWROOT BLANC-MANGE. 

    3 cups of new milk.
    2½ tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, wet up with cold milk.
    ¾ cup of sugar.
    Vanilla, lemon, or bitter almond flavoring, with a little white wine.

Mix the arrowroot to a smooth batter with one cup of the milk. Heat the
remainder to boiling; add the arrowroot, stirring constantly. When it
begins to thicken put in the sugar, and cook ten minutes longer, still
stirring it well from the sides and bottom. Take it off; beat well five
minutes; flavor with the essence and a small wineglass of white wine.
Give a hard final stir before putting it into a mould wet with cold
water.

This is very nourishing for invalids and young children. For the latter
you may omit the wine.


ALMOND BLANC-MANGE. 

    1 quart of milk.
    1 oz. Cooper’s gelatine.
    3 ozs. of almonds, blanched and pounded in a mortar, with
    1 tablespoonful of rose-water, added to prevent oiling.
    ¾ cup sugar.

Heat the milk to boiling, having previously soaked the gelatine in a
cup of it for an hour. Turn in this when the milk is scalding hot; add
the pounded almond-paste, and stir all together ten minutes before
putting in the sugar. When the gelatine has dissolved, remove the
blanc-mange from the vessel of boiling water in which you have cooked
it, and strain through a thin muslin bag, pressing it well to get out
the flavor of the almonds. There should be three or four bitter ones
among them. Wet a mould with cold water, put in the blanc-mange, and
set in a cold place until firm.

You may make blanc-mange without the almonds, although it will not be
so nice—and substitute vanilla for the rose-water.


NEAPOLITAN BLANC-MANGE. 

Make according to the foregoing receipt, and, after straining, separate
into four different portions, allowing about a cupful of the mixture
for each. Have ready

    1 great tablespoonful chocolate, wet with a very little boiling
        water, and rubbed to a smooth paste, for the brown coloring.
    Yolk of an egg beaten light for the yellow.
    1 great tablespoonful of currant jelly for the pink.

Beat the chocolate into one portion, mixing it well; the jelly into
another, the egg into a third, returning this and that flavored with
chocolate, to the fire, and stirring until very hot, but not boiling.
Leave the fourth uncolored. When quite cold and a little stiff, pour
carefully into a wet mould—the white first; then the pink; next the
yellow; and the chocolate last. Of course, when the blanc-mange is
turned out, this order of colors will be reversed. Set in a cold
place. Loosen, when firm, by dipping the mould for a moment in warm
water, and working the top free from the edge with a few light touches
of your fingers. This is a handsome dish and easily managed. Currant
juice or cranberry color a finer pink than jelly, but are apt to thin
the blanc-mange, unless used cautiously. A little vanilla improves the
chocolate.


JAUNE-MANGE. 

    1 oz. Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in half a cup cold water one hour.
    1 cup of boiling water.
    Yolks of four eggs beaten very light.
    1 orange, juice and half the grated peel.
    1 lemon, juice and one-third the grated peel.
    1 cup white wine or clear pale Sherry.
    1 cup powdered sugar and a good pinch cinnamon.

Stir the soaked gelatine in the boiling water until dissolved; take
from the fire and beat, a little at a time, into the yolks; return to
the inner saucepan with the sugar, orange, lemon and cinnamon. Stir
over a clear fire until it is boiling hot; put in the wine and strain
through a hair-sieve or a piece of tarlatan. Set away in a mould wet
with cold water.

The success of this dish depends much upon the stirring and the
watchfulness of the cook. The mixture should not be allowed to boil at
any moment.


VELVET BLANC-MANGE. 

    2 cups of sweet cream.
    ½ oz. Cooper’s gelatine, soaked in a very little cold water one hour.
    ½ cup white sugar (powdered.)
    1 teaspoonful extract of bitter almonds.
    1 glass white wine.
