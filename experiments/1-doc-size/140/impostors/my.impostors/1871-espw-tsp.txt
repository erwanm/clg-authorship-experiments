" You don't do none of my chawin'," says Bill, 
" less 'n five cents down." 

" Fact is," says Bub, ruefully, " I 'm out o' cash 
just now. Never you mind, though." 

Bub minds, however. He goes to work again 
with one eye on Bill. Bill's pocket is torn down. 
He must be green. You could a'most get a quid 
out and he 'd never know it. Bub watches his 
chance. He must have tobacco at any chance. 
The child lives upon it, like an old toper on his 
dram. Every inch of his little body craves it. 
He is in a dry, feverish heat. He thinks he shall 
burn up, if he does not get it. To work till 



nooning without it is not' to be thought of. He 
meant to have sold that rat to a chap he knew, 
and to have been supplied. 

Think a cove of his size can work all day 
without it ? You — bet — not — 

There is a spring and a cry. Bub has pounced 
upon Bill's torn pocket. Bill has backed, and 
dragged him. The wagging rag on Bub's little 
trousers has caught in a belt. 

All over the spooling-room there is a spring 
and a cry. 

All up the stairs there seems to be a spring 
and a cry. They come from the song about the 
Happy, Happy Day. The engines close teefh on 
the song_and the child together. 

They stop the machinery ; they run to and 
fro ; they huddle together ; they pick up 
something here, and wipe up something there, and 
cover up something yonder, closely ; they look 
at one another with white faces ; they sit down 
sickly ; they ask what is to do next. 

There is nothing to do. Bub has saved the 
State his two hundred and fifty dollars, and has 
Bill's quid of tobacco in his mangled hand. 
There is nothing to do. Life, like everything 





else, was quite too young for Bub. He has got 
so old, he has given it up. 

There is nothing to do but to carry the news 
now ; nobody likes to carry the news to the sick 
woman ; nobody offers ; the overseer, half wish- 
ing that there had been an oath or two less in 
the "jawing," volunteers to help about the — the 
— pieces, if they 'll find somebody to go on ahead. 
That's all he objects to ; goin' on ahead. 

Mr. Hayle the senior, who has been summoned 
from the counting-room, takes his hat to go in 
search of some one ; would go himself, but the 
fact is, he has never seen the woman, nor the 
father to know him by name, and feels a delicacy 
about obtruding his services. He mentions the 
matter to his son, but Maverick succinctly 
refuses ; remembers just now, for the first time 
since it happened, some long-past allusion of 
Miss Kelso's to a drain, and concludes that his 
personal sympathy can hardly be the most 
desirable to offer to Mr. Mell. 

Just without the mill-yard, bent upon some 
early errand of her own, the two gentlemen 
chance upon Perley. 



"Ask her" says the younger man, in a low 
voice ; " she would do to break ill news to the 
mother of the Maccabees." 

They pause to tell her what has happened ; 
their shocked faces speak faster than their slow 
words ; she understands quite what is needed of 
her ; has turned the corner to East Street, while 
their unfinished explanation hangs upon their 
decorous lips. 

The young man stands for a moment looking 
after her swift, strong, helpful figure, as it 
vanishes from view, with a sense of puzzled loss 
upon his handsome face, but shrugs his shoulders, 
and back in the counting-room shrugs them 
again. 

Perley is none too soon at the First Tenement 
and No. 6. 

The overlooker and his covered burden, and 
the little crowd that trails whispering after it, 
are just in sight, as she climbs the villanous 
stairs. 

The overlooker, and the covered burden, and 
the whispering crowd, are none too late at the 
First Tenement and No. 6. 

Mr. Mell comes out from the sick-room on 




tiptoe ; the children crouch and hide their faces 
behind the door ; the doctor, who has been, has 
gone, and the coughing and confusion are quite 
over. 

Mr. Mell stands still in the middle of the 
kitchen, with his hand at his ear. Whether he 
is listening to a thing which Perley says, — a 
gentle, awful thing, said in a gentle, awful voice, 
— or whether he is listening to certain sounds of 
feet upon the stairs, it were difficult to say. 

He stands still in the middle of the kitchen, 
with his hand behind his ear. 

The feet upon the stairs have climbed the 
stairs, have passed the stairs, have pass.ed the 
door, have paused. 

The overlooker, with his hat in his hand, has 
laid the covered burden softly down upon the
