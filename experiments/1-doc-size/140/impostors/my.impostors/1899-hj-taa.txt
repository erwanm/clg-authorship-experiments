family." 

A sound of protest rather formless escaped from the 
gentleman named, but Nanda continued to carry out her 
duty. " She told me to ask why he hadn't been again to 
see her. Mr. Mitcliy, sugar ? — isn't that the way to say 
it ? Three lumps ? You're like me, only that I more 
often take five." Mitchy had dashed forward for his 
tea ; she gave it to him ; then she added, with her 
eyes on Mr. Longdon's, which she had had no difficul- 
ty in catching : " She told me to ask you all sorts of 
things." 

The old man had got up to take his cup from Vander- 
bank, whose hand, however, dealt with him on the ques- 
tion of sitting down again. Mr. Longdon, resisting, kept 
erect with a low gasp that his host only was near enough 
to catch. This suddenly appeared to confirm an impres- 
sion gathered by Vanderbank in their contact, a strange 
sense that his visitor was so agitated as to be trembling 
in every limb. It brought to his lips a kind of ejacula- 
tion — ''I say !" But even as he spoke, Mr. Longdon's 
face, still white, but with a smile that was not all pain, 
seemed to supplicate him not to notice ; and he was not 
a man to require more than this to achieve a divination 
as deep as it was rapid. "Why, we've all been scattered 
for Easter, haven't we ?" he asked of Nanda. '  Mr. 
Longdon has been at home, your mother and father 
have been paying visits, I myself have been out of Lon- 
don, Mitchy has been to Paris, and you — oh yes, I know 
where you've been." 





 

''Ah, we all know that — there has been such a row 
made about it !" Mitchy said. 

'' Yes, I've heard of the feeling there is," Nanda re- 
plied. ''It's supposed to be awful, my knowing Tishy 
— quite too awful." 

Mr. Longdon, with Vanderbank's covert aid, had be- 
gun to appear to have pulled himself together, dropping 
back upon his sofa and giving some attention to his tea. 
It might have been with the notion of showing himself 
at ease that he turned, on this, a benevolent smile to the 
girl. "But what, my dear, is the objection — ?" 

She looked gravely from him to Vanderbank and to 
Mitchy and then back again from one of these to the 
other. " Do you think I ought to say ?" 

They both laughed, and they both just appeared un- 
certain, but Vanderbank spoke first. "I don't imagine, 
Nanda, that you really know." 

"Ko— as a family, you're perfection!" Mitchy broke 
out. Before the fire again, with his cup, he addressed 
his hilarity to Mr. Longdon. "I told you a tremendous 
lot, didn't I ? But I didn't tell you about that." 

The old man maintained, yet with a certain vague- 
ness, the attitude of amiable inquiry. " About the — a — 
family ?" 

" Well," Mitchy smiled, " about its ramifications. This 
young lady has a tremendous friendship — and, in short, 
it's all very complicated." 

"My dear Nanda," said Vanderbank, "it's all very 
simple. Don't believe a word of anything of the sort." 

He had spoken as with the intention of a large, light 
optimism ; but there was clearly something in the girl 
that would always make for lucidity. "Do you mean 
about Carrie Donner ? I doiiH believe it, and at any 
rate I don't think it's any one's business. I shouldn't 
have a very high opinion of a person who would give up 
a friend." She stopped short, with the sense apparent- 




  

ly that she was saying more than she meant, though, 
strangely, as if it had been an effect of her type and of 
her voice, there was neither pertness nor passion in the 
profession she had just made. Curiously wanting as she 
seemed both in timidity and in levity, she was to a cer- 
tainty not self-conscious — she was extraordinarily simple. 
Mr. Longdon looked at her now with an evident surrender 
to his extreme interest, and it might well have perplexed 
him to see her at once so downright and yet of so fresh 
and sweet a tenderness of youth. 

"That's right, that's right, my dear young lady: 
never, never give up a friend for anything any one says I" 
It was Mitchy who rang out with this lively wisdom, the 
action of which on Mr. Longdon — unless indeed it was 
the action of something else — was to make that person- 
age, in a manner that held the others watching him in 
slight suspense, suddenly spring to his feet again, put 
down his teacup carefully on a table near him and then, 
without a word, as if no one had been present, quietly 
wander away and disappear through the door left open 
on Vanderbank's entrance. It opened into a second, a 
smaller sitting-room, into which the eyes of his com- 
panions followed him. 

"What's the matter ?" Nanda asked. "Has he been 
taken- ill?" 

" He is ' rum,' my dear Van," Mitchy said ; " but you're 
right — of a charm, a distinction I In short just the sort 
of thing we want." 

"The sort of thing we  ' want' — I dare say!" Vander- 
bank laughed. " But it's not the sort of thing that's to 
be had for the asking — it's a sort we shall be mighty 
lucky if we can get !" 

Mitchy turned with amusement to Nanda. "Van has 
invented him, and, with the natural greed of the inventor, 
won't let us have him cheap. Well," he went on, "I'll 
pay my share of the expense." 





 

" The difficulty is tliat he's so much too good for us' 
Vanderbank explained.
