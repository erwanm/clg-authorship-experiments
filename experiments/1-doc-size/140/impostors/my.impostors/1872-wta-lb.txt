has the St. John postmark upon it, and I know what that means without
opening it."

"He tried to run me down," added Bobtail.

"I saw him do it. His game is nearly up. I intended to arrest him when
he came down from the hotel, but he took the alarm from what Ben told
him."

As the Eagle ran out from the land, it was evident that she could not
long carry her foresail. It was taken in very soon, but she sailed
faster without it than with it. The Skylark gained rapidly upon her. The
water--Frenchman's Bay--was studded with islands, but Mr. Hines, who had
taken the helm, was perfectly familiar with the navigation. As the race
began to be a desperate one for Captain Chinks, he dodged in among the
islands, tempting his pursuer to make short cuts over sunken ledges; but
in all these expedients he failed. The Eagle was a keel boat, and drew
more water than the Skylark, so that wherever the former went the
latter need not fear to follow. At last Captain Chinks appeared to have
given up the race, and Mr. Hines surmised that he was running for a
landing-place on one of the islands. But the Skylark was still gaining,
and was now almost abreast of the Eagle.

"All ready, Mr. Brooks," said the detective, as the bowsprit of the
sloop came up with the quarter of the schooner.

"I'm ready," replied the deputy sheriff, as he went forward to the bow
of the yacht.

"Stand by the sheets, Bobtail, for I don't know what he will do next."

"Ay, ay, sir!" responded the skipper. "Have a fender ready, Monkey."

"All right."

In a moment more, the forecastle of the Skylark was abreast, on the
weather side, of the Eagle, taking the wind out of her mainsail in part.

"Hard down," shouted Mr. Brooks, as he saw Captain Clunks jam down the
helm of the schooner.

Both boats came up into the wind alongside each other, and Monkey was
busy with his fender. The deputy sheriff leaped upon the deck of the
Eagle, and Mr. Hines, giving the helm to Bobtail, followed him. The
skipper permitted the yacht to come about, and she went clear of the
other boat.

"You are my prisoner, Captain Chinks," said Mr. Brooks.

"What for?" gasped the captain.

"For stealing that letter."

"I didn't steal it."

"That remains to be proved."

"We ain't in Knox County now."

"Never mind; I will take you for violating the revenue laws," added Mr.
Hines, as he took the helm of the schooner.

"I hain't done nothing," protested Captain Chinks.

"We will go over to Camden, and settle that point some other time."

The captain was obliged to give it up, and he groaned in bitterness of
spirit. To be charged with stealing the letter, and with violating the
revenue laws at the same time, was more than he had anticipated. On the
first, if convicted, he would be sentenced to imprisonment, and on the
other, to pay a heavy fine. His crimes brought loss of liberty and loss
of property.

Bobtail eased off his mainsheet, and waited for the Eagle to come up.
Mr. Hines had already decided to return to Camden in Captain Chinks's
boat, and when he had announced his purpose, the Skylark filled away
again. It was now about noon, and as the wind was contrary for at least
half the way back to Camden, the skipper hardly expected to reach his
destination that night. The yacht very soon ran away from the schooner,
and at six o'clock had made half the distance. She had come up with the
point which forms the south-eastern point of the town of Brooklyn, where
she started her sheets, and ran through the channel between Deer Island
and Sedgwick.

The wind was still unsteady, coming in heavy flaws; but now it was
beginning to haul more to the southward. This change was favorable, for
it enabled the Skylark to lay her course for Camden. But an awful sea
was rolling in from the ocean, and the yacht jumped like a galloping
horse. The wind freshened into a gale with the change, and the gusts
were more fitful and violent. The jib was taken in, and Monkey was
thoroughly ducked in the operation, for the Skylark occasionally slapped
the waves with her bowsprit. Great black clouds were rolling up off to
seaward, but Bobtail was confident that the yacht was equal to anything.
Under the lee of an island, the mainsail was close-reefed; but she flew
over the waves, and the skipper hoped to reach his destination by nine
in the evening. At eight o'clock, while it was still light, he
discovered a schooner working down the bay under jib and reefed mainsail
which he recognized as the Penobscot.




CHAPTER XVII.

THE WRECK OF THE PENOBSCOT.


"That's the Penobscot!" exclaimed Bobtail, as soon as he identified her.

"She is taking a nasty night to go to sea," added Monkey.

"She will put into Rockland or Camden. I suppose the colonel is in a
hurry to get to Newport for some race. He told me yesterday he should
sail to-day."

"She ain't going into Camden. If she was, she wouldn't be out there.
She's right off the ledges, and if she don't tack soon, she'll be on
'em," said the Darwinian.

"I think she's going into Rockland. She can make it in one more
stretch."

"She can get in behind Owl's Head, and lay as easy as if she was in a
mill pond."

"That's an awful sea out there, Monkey," said Bobtail. "See the
breakers on that lower ledge. If I was the captain of the Penobscot, I
should go in stays. There she goes!"

At this moment the sails of the large yacht shook, as her head came up
to the wind. But the next instant she fell off, heeled over, and drove
ahead again. Bobtail distinctly heard a shout from her, though she was a
mile distant. He watched her with his heart in his mouth, and his worst
fears were realized when he saw her lift her bow high up in the water.
She had run upon the ledge.

"By gracious! she is on the rocks!" cried Bobtail, wild with excitement
and anxiety.

"So she is!" gasped Monkey.
