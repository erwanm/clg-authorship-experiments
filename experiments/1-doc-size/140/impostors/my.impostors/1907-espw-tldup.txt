The telephone called loudly at that moment, and 
the doctor answered it without delay. With a word 
of explanation to his waiting patients, he hurried 
limping out into the hall, and seized his hat. 

" It is an emergency call," he said to Mrs. Dane. 
" There seems to have been a little accident among 
those bridal people. I must go at once." 

He was gone some time, so long that the patients 
grew discouraged, and drifted one by one away. 
When he returned, the office was empty, and the 
house was still. Clyde was asleep upon the rug ; 
in his sleep he groaned and growled. Mrs. Dane 
was sitting by the office fire. She rose to greet the 
doctor, but asked no questions. 

"Can I have a little hot water?" he asked 

quietly. 

 

She brought it, and he boiled it over his alcohol 
lamp, that he might sterilize his instruments ; he 
put them away before he spoke. 

" There is something you have got to know, and 
I may as well tell you. It is an unfortunate affair, 
and Clyde was mixed up in it. He has bitten a 
man." 

" Not — not — " she began, and paled. 

" Yes, he has bitten Dr. Frost. He has hurt his 
hand pretty badly — his right hand." 

Cara got down upon the rug beside the dog, 
and drew his head upon her knee. Her trembling 
fingers touched Clyde's old scar — the scar so deep 
that the hair had never covered it. 

" He may have had a reason ! " she cried. 

" Yes, I know," replied the doctor. 

" What do you know ? " The searchlight of her 
troubled eyes traversed the physician's face. 

" He told me," observed Dr. Royal, quietly. " He 
explained the circumstances. He said that he once 
experimented on the dog — of course not know- 
ing him to be yours. He said that Clyde had never 
forgiven him ; that he had attacked him before." 

" Oh, what will they do to Clyde ? " moaned 
Cara. " If they are going to kill him, I would 
rather do it myself. I will chloroform him. No 
one else shall touch him." She began to tremble 
heavily. 

 

" Don't distress yourself," said Dr. Royal, kindly. 
" Clyde will not be harmed. Frost doesn't want 
the story to get out. I don't think he is 
particularly proud of it. He says he does not wish 
his wife to know. He invented some explanation 
of the accident. I think it will pass. I believe he 
slipped on the rocks; had a bad fall; a rolling 
stone hurt him; something of that kind — that is 
his business. Mine is to keep a patient's 
confidence — I told you because — " 

"Yes," interrupted Carolyn. "You had to tell 
me. I ought to know. We shall have to keep 
Clyde tied up." 

" Till Frost leaves the village, I think you will. 
He won't stay any longer than he can help. If it 
proves serious, he will go back to town, where he 
can get a bigger surgeon than I am." 

" Will he lose his hand ? " asked Carolyn, with 
difficulty. 

"No, oh, no. Only his honeymoon. With proper 
care, I think we can save the hand ; but I am afraid 
— it will be rather stiff." 

" It is shocking ! " said Cara, with emotion. 

" It is unfortunate," replied the doctor. " Neme- 
sis usually is. The most interesting thing to me 
about it — " he paused. 

"What is the most interesting thing to you 
about it ? " demanded Mrs. Dane. 

 

" Why, that he doesn't want his wife to know. 
The terrible and beautiful power of the marriage 
bond has set in already." 

" Upon Thomas Frost?" 

" Even upon him." 

The two were standing opposite each other as 
they exchanged these words. Their eyes, brimming 
lakes of feeling, met as if they united in one
unfathomable sea. Carolyn felt herself swayed to the 
deeps. Between her allegiance to the vanished and 
her attraction to the apparent, she vibrated in a 
piteous vacillation. The old contention between 
the quick and the dead made havoc of her, and 
she had no more power of resistance to it than 
a battleground has of rebellion to conflicting 
armies. The moment had become so tense, it 
was with a sense of escape that she heard the 
steps of her cousin upon the piazza, and turned 
at his familiar hand upon the door to meet and 
greet him. This she did with a cordiality so 
assumed that he felt it — his hurt face showed 
how much. He glanced from her to her tenant, 
first with the priest's and then with the prophet's 
look. 

Clyde came out slowly to extend the hospitality 
of the cottage to its kinsman. The dog walked 
with dignity. Not a cloud of guilt lurked in his 
fine eyes. He spurned the floor with a lofty pride. 

 

He had the air of a noble avenger, who had righted 
the wrongs of a race. 

Impulsively, without remembering that she was
