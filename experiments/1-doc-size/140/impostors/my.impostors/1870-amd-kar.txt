" And what did you say to her ? " 

" It was enough to vex a fellow," was his lame 
justification. 





"Whose patience and consideration are not 
wonderfully extensive. I am very sorry that you 
spoke so harshly and accused her unjustly, since 
you knew the reason, - - that she had gone to give a 
sick friend a little change and pleasure." 

Eob kicked the gravel in the path rather spite- 
fully. " If she had not stayed with the girls," he said. 

" What would you have done had it been boys in- 
stead ? " 

Eob could not venture upon an answer. To say 
that he should have come directly home would have 
been stretching probability beyond its verge. He 
felt that he was in the wrong, and kept silence. 

" So I think you owe Kathie an apology." 

Uncle Eobert's sway had been gentle but firm. 
He rarely insisted that his nephew should do any 
particular thing, but he brought a very strong moral 
pressure that it was quite difficult to evade. The 
boy was rather cross and sulky than humble. In 
fact Eob had allowed himself to get altogether out 
of gear, and felt worse than ever when he found 
that he could lay the blame on no one, except 
Eobert Alston, who was in his mind a rather un- 
fortunate and suffering individual. 



 

" I leave you to make it up with Kathie," Uncle 
Robert said, cheerily, turning away. 

Girls were unmitigated nuisances. If the world 
had only "been peopled with boys instead, and if they 
could only do anything without being brought to a 
strict account ! Kob sighed in a heart-breaking 
fashion and went down to the lake. If he only 
had a boat ! 

He came home just in time for supper. His 
mother was passing through the hall with a dish of 
fruit in her hand. 

" How tired you look ! " she said, in her soft, 
motherly voice, different from any other voice in the 
world. " You should not have gone out after Dick 
Grayson went away." Then she passed her cool 
hand over his forehead. 

Eob winked away something wonderfully like a 
tear. It was the " foes within " rather than any 
physical exertion. 

Uncle Eobert had said the best way to repair a 
wrong was to acknowledge it immediately. And 
after all Eob's bravado out in the woods he felt 
that he had been at fault. Giants reared their 
heads in palaces as well as the little brcwi*. house 





over yonder, and it was just as necessary to fight 
them here as it had been there. 

So he washed his face in good cold water that 
cleared the cobwebs from his brain ; he combed the 
tangles out of his curly hair and felt quite like 
another boy. 

Eunning down stairs, he met Kathie looking fresh 
and sweet as a rose. 

" I was as rude as a bear to you a little while ago,'
he said, in a hurried whisper. " And I 

" Never mind. I was having such a nice time that 
I quite forgot about every one else ; but you may have 
the ponies all clay to-morrow, - - that will make it 
about straight again." 

He wasn't a bit afraid to meet Uncle Kobert's eye, 
and he felt as light and cheery about the heart as 
you please. He even went and had a nice time with 
Prince, who wagged his shaggy tail and looked out of 
his great delighted eyes as only a dog can look. And 
that evening he and Uncle Robert had a good long 
talk about the old Australian life. 



 



CHAPTEE II. 

EOB'S WEEK OF FUN. 

BOB'S vacation was signalized by the promised 
visit to New York, and he enjoyed it immensely. 
It made no difference to him that all the fashion- 
able people had gone to Saratoga or Newport. 
They had left the Park, the hotels, the broad bay, 
and the islands, and Eob felt that when the week 
came to an end he had not seen half, though he 
had gone about continually. He pitied Kathie a 
good deal for having been a girl and not able to 
enjoy the sights in his fashion. 

" But I had a lovely time," she said, contentedly. 

" And she brought me home a locomotive," put 
in Fred, as a sort of settler for the superiority of 
her visit. 

"But she had a wonderful purse, and I have 
not," he returned. 

Truth to tell, he had not thought about bringing 
them anything. Eob was always too well satisfied
