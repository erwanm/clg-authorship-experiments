well to forswear it at once: your effort to act 
upon it makes you, you see, so remarkable!" 

Still wound up to his amenity then, Ralph 
yielded to this plea even if it seemed to breathe 
upon him afresh that chill of the inevitable, re 
siding now in his so witnessed power to raise to 
the highest point the forces of attention he ex 
cited, the repetition of which, from one quarter 
and another, hadn't even yet taught him how to 
carry off the fact that he braved it. For he did 
brave it, he was braving it, braving it at that 





  

very moment in his grimaced understanding with 
Sir Cantopher, the understanding that his face 
invited the others also to see he didn't fear. What 
had been deep within him for weeks and weeks 
but exactly that measure of it now more and 
more heaped up and the interest of dealing with 
which had originally so inspired him? "I'm in 
your hands, as I've told you before" he smiled 
and smiled; "I'm in your hands, I'm in your 
hands!" 

"Ah but don't say it as if I were going to drag 
you to the assizes or the pillory !" Sir Cantopher 
gave way to that special shade of his amusement 
which was somehow all edges and points. 

Ralph winced for a moment as one who feels 
in an offered love-pat the touch of a prickly glove 
winced fairly to the extent of again dropping 
his presence of mind and once more snatching it 
up. "Is that the way I say it?" he asked of 
Molly with such a flush of tender protest as to 
make her fix him an instant with the very widest 
eyes she had yet opened and then come at him 
straight. She didn't speak as she crossed to him, 
and it was wondrous to him to feel and to know 
a few seconds later that this was because the 
attempt for her would have been but formless 
sound. She answered him otherwise; her arms 
were round his neck and her face pressed there, 
while, with his own gratefully bent to it, he felt 
her hold him in a clasp of possession that was 





  

like a resistance to something unseen. He couldn't 
for that minute himself speak, though the sense 
of his clutch articulated would have been "Hold 
me, yes; hold me close, close, and let us stay 
this way!" They did stay in fact or when he 
next measured time it was as if they had been 
wholly and incalculably absent: so absent, and 
for so long, that on his reckoning again with the 
conditions about him they struck him at once 
as different and as somehow mastered. Had he 
literally and in so extraordinary a manner slept 
in his mistress's arms ? There was no one to ask 
it of but poor Perry for Sir Cantopher apparently 
had in the interval departed, Mrs. Midmore at 
tending him out of sight, and Molly, herself 
aware of that, was already at the door, her hand 
on it for the moment, holding it open, while her 
look at him recognised even to extravagance 
what they had "done" as if she wanted him to 
know that she knew it, though with something 
in it for her too that drove her, as he might feel, 
before it. 

This was not prolonged, and yet Ralph could 
note, for his bewilderment, that some time must 
already have elapsed, since there came in to him 
by the open door, from hall or staircase, no after- 
sound of Mrs. Midmore's retirement with her 
friend. That explained itself, however, with his 
quick apprehension that they would have passed 
out by the other door of the room, which was 





  

ajar, as it hadn't been before, and which com 
municated, as he was afterwards to know, with 
other parts of the ample house, including the 
secondary staircase and his kinswoman's boudoir 
he was for the first time in his life really to 
conceive that last convenience. He was at any 
rate apparently to be left alone with Perry, not 
taking leave of the others, but suddenly quitted 
by them or with Molly, for the next thing, at 
the most, committing him a little portentously 
to her brother. For she had in a few seconds 
more turned her eyes to Perry, who spoke at 
once as if she had put him a mute question and 
as if he had caught some sound from below. This 
sound in fact, as more of it came by Molly's 
door, reached Ralph sufficiently to explain her 
brother's lively comment, the liveliest he had 
yet uttered on anything at all: "It's Nan, it's 
Nan!" 

The words had on Molly a remarkable effect, 
making her listen hard for a moment where she 
stood, and then, without as yet meeting again 
her lover's attention, appear to understand what 
was happening. As soon as she had understood 
she sharply closed the door, while Perry repeated 
his elation, or whatever it was, of assurance. 

"She has got here by herself she has travelled 
by the coach ! She has come up to see him, damn 
him !" he said to his sister quite as if Ralph hadn't 
been present. 





  

" ' Damn him ' ? " she echoed, now looking 
queerly at Ralph. 

"Damn her then!" Perry cried, but again 
with a happier frankness than he had hitherto
