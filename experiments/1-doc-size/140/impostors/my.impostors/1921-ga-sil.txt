throats. They worship success like all the rest of the 
world. Their fancied distaste for people engaged in any 
of the art careers — with whom they practically never 
come in contact, by the way — is partly an instinctive 
distrust of anything they cannot do themselves and 
partly because they have an Elizabethan idea that all 
artists are common and have offensive manners." 

"I don't like the idea of your using your own name. 
Ladies may unfortunately be obliged to earn their own 
living — and that you shall never do when I am rich — 
but they have no business putting their names up before 
the public like men. ' ' 

Grora looked at his rigid indomitable face ; the face of 
the Pilgrim fathers, of the revolutionary statesmen, 
which he had inherited intact from old John Dwight 
who had sat in the first congress; the American classic 
face that is passing but still crops out as nuexpectedly 
as the last drop from a long forgotten "tar brush," or 
the sly recurrent Biblical profile. 

"We will make a bargain," she said calmly. "I will 
ask you no more questions about your business for a 
year — when, if convenient, I should like my money — 
and you will kindly ignore the literary career I mean to 
have. It won't do you the least good in the world to- 
f ormulate opinions about anything I choose to do. Now, 
better concentrate on Alexina. You've got your hands 
full there. See you at breakfast." And she shut the 
door on an indignant worried and disgusted brother. 



 



CHAPTBE IV 



WHEN Mortimer, after tapping on his wife's door, 
was bidden to enter he found her sitting with 
Aileen over a breakfast tray, the belated tears running 
down into her coffee. Aileen, promising to return after 
she had given her father his breakfast, made a hasty 
retreat; and Dwight took his wife in his arms and 
soothed the grief which grew almost hysterical in its 
reaction from the insensibility of the morning. 

"You won't leave me for a moment?" she sobbed, in 
this mood finding his sympathy exquisite and necessary. 
"You'll stay home — until— until " 

"Of course. I'll telephone Wicksam after breakfast. 
He can run the office for a day or two. By the way 
Maria will be here this evening; Sally is better. Joan 
and Tom and the rest will be here in about an hour. 
Tom and I will attend to everything. You are not to 
bother, not to think. ' ' 

"Oh, you are too wonderful — always so strong — so 
strong — how I love it. But I'LL never get over this — 
poor old mommy!" 

But the paroxysm passed, and just as Mortimer was 
on the verge of morning starvation and too polite to 
mention it, she grew calm by degrees and sent him 
down to breakfast. The emotional phase of her grief 
was over. 



CHAPTER V 



IT was three months later that Aileen, once more sitting in Alexina's bedroom, after her return from 
Santa Barbara, where she had gone with her father for 



 

the summer, said abruptly: "Dad is terribly cut up, 
dear old thing. He'd known your mother since they 
were both children, in the days when there were wooden 
sidewalks on Montgomery Street, and Laurel Hill was 
called Lone Mountain, and they had picnics in it. Odd 
they both should have had young daughters. Another 
link — what? as the English say. Well — anyhow — he 
told me to tell you that he was just as fond of your 
father as of your mother, and that you must try to 
imagine that he is your father from this time forth, and 
come to him when you are in doubt about anything." 

Alexina looked her straight in the eyes. ' ' I have sometimes thought uncle daddy didn't like Mortimer." 

"On the contrary, he rather likes him. He respects a 
capacity for hard work, and persistence, and a reputation for uncompromising honesty. But of course Mortimer is young — in business, that is; and father thinks — 
but you had better talk with him." 

"No. Why should I? But I don't mind you. At 
least I could not discuss Mortimer with any one else. 
I am furious with Tom Abbott. He wants me to put 
my money in trust, with himself and uncle daddy as 
trustees — ignoring Mortimer, whom he pretends to like. 
He says Maria's fortune has been kept intact, that he 
has never touched a cent of it, but that men in business 
are likely to get into tight places and use their wife's 
money. Nothing would induce Mortimer to touch my 
money, but he would feel pretty badly cut up if I let 
any one else look after my affairs. Of course I wouldn't 
even discuss the matter with Tom. And if Morty does 
need money at any time I'll lend it to him. Why not? 
What else would any one expect me to do ? " 

' ' Of course Tom Abbott went to work the wrong way, 
the blundering idiot. No one doubts Mortimer's good 
faith, but the times are awful, money has paresis ; and 
when you are obliged to take any of your own out of the 
stocking in order to keep business going, it is easily lost. 
Dad hopes you will hang on like grim death to your 
inheritance. You see — the times are so abnormal, Mortimer hasn't had time to prove his abilities yet; he's just 
been able to hold on; and if things don't mend and he 



 

should lose out, why — if you still have your own little 
fortune, at least you'll not be any worse off than you 
are now. Don't you see?" 

' ' Yes, I see. But Mortimer has told me of other panics 
and bad times. They always pass, and better times come 
again. And if he has been able to hold on, that at least 
shows ability, for others have gone under. Of course 
we shall live here and run the house — as mother did.
