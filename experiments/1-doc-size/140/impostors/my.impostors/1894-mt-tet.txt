the closing week of the canvass. He led his brother 
a fearful dance. 

But he saved his best card for the very eve of the 
election. There was to be a grand turnout of the 
Teetotalers' Union that day, and Angelo was to 
march at the head of the procession and deliver a 
great oration afterward. Luigi drank a couple of 
glasses of whisky — which steadied his nerves and 
clarified his mind, but made Angelo drunk. Every- 
body who saw the march, saw that the Champion of 
the Teetotalers was half seas over, and noted also 
that his brother, who made no hypocritical preten- 
sions to extra temperance virtues, was dignified and 
sober. This eloquent fact could not be unfruitful at 
the end of a hot political canvass. At the mass- 
meeting Angelo tried to make his great temperance 
oration, but was so discommoded by hiccoughs and 
thickness of tongue that he had to give it up; then 
drowsiness overtook him and his head drooped 
against Luigi's and he went to sleep. Luigi apolo- 
gized for him, and was going on to improve his op- 
portunity with an appeal for a moderation of what 
he called "the prevailing teetotal madness," but 
persons in the audience began to howl and throw 
things at him, and then the meeting rose in wrath 
and chased him home. 

This episode was a crusher for Angelo in another 
way. It destroyed his chances with Rowena. Those 
chances had been growing, right along, for two 
months. Rowena had partly confessed that she 
loved him, but wanted time to consider. Now the 
tender dream was ended, and she told him so the 
moment he was sober enough to understand. She 
said she would never marry a man who drank. 

"But I don't drink," he pleaded. 

"That is nothing to the point," she said, coldly, 
"you get drunk, and that is worse." 

(There was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion here, which 
ended as reported in a previous note.] 





CHAPTER X 

SO THEY HANGED LUIGI 

DAWSON'S LANDING had a week of repose, 
after the election, and it needed it, for the 
frantic and variegated nightmare which had tor- 
mented it all through the preceding week had left it 
limp, haggard, and exhausted at the end. It got the 
week of repose because Angelo had the legs, and 
was in too subdued a condition to want to go out 
and mingle with an irritated community that had 
come to distrust and detest him because there was 
such a lack of harmony between his morals, which 
were confessedly excellent, and his methods of 
illustrating them, which were distinctly damnable. 
The new city officers were sworn in on the follow- 
ing Monday — at least all but Luigi. There was a 
complication in his case. His election was con- 
ceded, but he could not sit in the board of aldermen 
without his brother, and his brother could not sit 
there because he was not a member. There seemed 
to be no way out of the difficulty but to carry the 
matter into the courts, so this was resolved upon. 
The case was set for the Monday fortnight. In due 
course the time arrived. In the mean time the city 
government had been at a standstill, because with- 
out Luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen, 
whereas with him the liquor interest — the richest in 

the political field — would have one majority. But 
the court decided that Angelo could not sit in the 
board with him, either in public or executive ses- 
sions, and at the same time forbade the board to 
deny admission to Luigi, a fairly and legally chosen 
alderman. The case was carried up and up from 
court to court, yet still the same old original de- 
cision was confirmed every time. As a result, the 
city government not only stood still, with its hands 
tied, but everything it was created to protect and 
care for went a steady gait toward rack and ruin. 
There was no way to levy a tax, so the minor officials 
had to resign or starve; therefore they resigned. 
There being no city money, the enormous legal 
expenses on both sides had to be defrayed by private 
subscription. But at last the people came to their 
senses, and said: 

"Pudd'nhead was right at the start — we ought to 
have hired the official half of that human phillipene 
to resign; but it's too late now; some of us haven't 
got anything left to hire him with." 

"Yes, we have," said another citizen, "we've got 
this" — and he produced a halter. 

Many shouted: "That's the ticket." But others 
said: "No — Count Angelo is innocent; we mustn't 
hang him." 

"Who said anything about hanging him? We 
are only going to hang the other one." 

"Then that is all right — there is no objection to 
that." 

So they hanged Luigi. And so ends the history 
of "Those Extraordinary Twins." 





FINAL REMARKS 

As you see, it was an extravagant sort of a tale, 
and had no purpose but to exhibit that monstrous 
"freak" in all sorts of grotesque lights. But when 
Roxy wandered into the tale she had to be furnished 
with something to do; so she changed the children 
in the cradle; this necessitated the invention of a 
reason for it; this, in turn, resulted in making the 
children prominent personages — nothing could pre- 
vent it, of course. Their career began to take a 
tragic aspect, and some one had to be brought in to 
help work the machinery; so Pudd'nhead Wilson 
was introduced and taken on trial. By this time the 
whole show was being run by the new people and in 
their interest, and the original show was become 
side-tracked and forgotten; the twin-monster, and 
the heroine, and the lads, and the old ladies had
