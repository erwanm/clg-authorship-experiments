was over, the book was finished, she was side- 
tracked, and there was no possible way of crowding 
her in, anywhere. I could not leave her there, of 
course; it would not do. After spreading her out 
so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it 
would be absolutely necessary to account to the 
reader for her. I thought and thought and studied 
and studied ; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw 
plainly that there was really no way but one — I 
must simply give her the grand bounce. It grieved 
me to do it, for after associating with her so much I 
had come to kind of like her after a fashion, notwithstanding 
she was such an ass and said such 
stupid, irritating things and was so nauseatingly 
sentimental. Still it had to be done. So, at the top 
of Chapter XVII, I put a "Calendar" remark con- 
cerning July Fourth, and began the chapter with 
this statistic: 

"Rowena went out in the back yard after supper 
to see the fireworks and fell down the well and got 
drowned." 

It seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader 
wouldn't notice it, because I changed the subject 
right away to something else. Anyway it loosened 
up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her 
out of the way, and that was the main thing. It 
seemed a prompt good way of weeding out people 
that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way 
for those others; so I hunted up the two boys and 
said "they went out back one night to stone the cat 
and fell down the well and got drowned." Next I 
searched around and found old Aunt Patsy Cooper 
and Aunt Betsy Hale where they were aground, and 
said "they went out back one night to visit the sick 
and fell down the well and got drowned." I was 
going to drown some of the others, but I gave up the 
idea, partly because I believed that if I kept that 
up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy 
with those people, and partly because it was not a 
large well and would not hold any more anyway. 

Still the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set 
of new characters who were become inordinately 
prominent and who persisted in remaining so to the 
end; and back yonder was an older set who made a 
large noise and a great to-do for a little while and 
then suddenly played out utterly and fell down the 
well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I 
must search it out and cure it. 

The defect turned out to be the one already 
spoken of — two stories in one, a farce and a tragedy. 
So I pulled out the farce and left the tragedy. This 
left the original team in, but only as mere names, 
not as characters. Their prominence was wholly 
gone; they were not even worth drowning; so I 
removed that detail. Also I took those twins apart 
and made two separate men of them. They had no 
occasion to have foreign names now, but it was too 
much trouble to remove them all through, so I left 
them christened as they were and made no explanation. 




THE TWINS AS THEY REALLY WERE 

THE conglomerate twins were brought on the 
stage in Chapter I of the original extravaganza. 
Aunt Patsy Cooper has received their letter applying 
for board and lodging, and Rowena, her daughter, 
insane with joy, is begging for a hearing of it: 

"Well, set down then, and be quiet a minute and 
don't fly around so; it fairly makes me tired to see 
you. It starts off so: 'Honored Madam — '" 

"I like that, ma, don't you? It shows they're 
high-bred." 

"Yes, I noticed that when I first read it. 'My 
brother and I have seen your advertisement, by 
chance, in a copy of your local journal — ' " 

"It's so beautiful and smooth, ma — don't you 
think so?" 

"Yes, seems so to me — and beg leave to take 
the room you offer. We are twenty-four years of 
age, and twins — '" 

"Twins! How sweet! I do hope they are hand- 
some, and I just know they are! Don't you hope 
they are, ma?" 

"Land, I ain't particular. 'We are Italians by 
birth—'" 

"It's so romantic! Just think — there's never 
been one in this town, and everybody will want to 
see them, and they're all ours! Think of that!" 


' — 'but have lived long in the various countries 
of Europe, and several years in the United States.'" 

"Oh, just think what wonders they've seen, ma! 
Won't it be good to hear them talk?" 

"I reckon so; yes, I reckon so. 'Our names 
are Luigi and Angelo Capello — '" 

"Beautiful, perfectly beautiful! Not like Jones 
and Robinson and those horrible names." 

"'You desire but one guest, but dear madam, if 
you will allow us to pay for two we will not discom- 
mode you. We will sleep together in the same bed. 
We have always been used to this, and prefer it.' 
And then he goes on to say they will be down 
Thursday." 

"And this is Tuesday — I don't know how I'm 
ever going to wait, ma! The time does drag along 
so, and I'm so dying to see them! Which of them 
do you reckon is the tallest, ma?" 

"How do you s'pose I can tell, child? Mostly 
they are the same size — twins are." 

"Well then, which do you reckon is the best 
looking?" 

"Goodness knows — I don't." 

"I think Angelo is; it's the prettiest name, any- 
way. Don't you think it's a sweet name, ma?"
