The Duchess could not speak, but she kissed Joan on 
the forehead ; and so they parted. 

We left on the 6th and stopped over at Romorantin ; 
then on the 9th Joan entered Orleans in state, under 
triumphal arches, with the welcoming' cannon thundering and 
seas of welcoming flags fluttering in the breeze. The 
Grand Staff" rode with her, clothed in shining splendours of 
costume and decorations : the Duke d'Alengon ; the Bastard 
of Orleans ; the Sire de Boussac, Marshal of France ; the 
Lord de Graville, Master of the Crossbowmen ; the Sire 
de Culan, Admiral of France ; Ambroise de Lore ; Etienne 
de Vignoles, called La Hire ; Gautier de Brusac, and other 
illustrious captains. 

It was grand times : the usual shoutings, and packed 
multitudes, the usual crush to get sight of Joan ; but at 
last we crowded through to our old lodgings, and I saw 
old Boucher and the wife and that dear Catherine gather 
Joan to their hearts and smother her with kisses — and my 
heart ached so ! for I could have kissed Catherine better 
than anybody, and more and longer ; yet was not thought 
of for that office, and I so famished for it. Ah, she was 
so beautiful, and oh, so sweet ! I had loved her the first 
day I ever saw her, and from that day forth she was sacred 
to me. I have carried her image in my heart for sixty- 
three years — all lonely there, yes, solitary, for it never has 
had company — and I am grown so old, so old : but it, oh, 
it is as fresh and young and merry and mischievous and 
lovely and sweet and pure and witching and divine as it 
was when it crept in there, bringing benediction and peace 
to its habitation so long ago, so long ago — for it has not 
aged a day ! 

CHAPTER XXVI 

This time, as before, the King's last command to the 
generals was this : ' See to it that you do nothing without the 
sanction of the Maid. And this time the command was 
obeyed ; and would continue to be obeyed all through the 
coming great days of the Loire campaign. 

That was a change ! That was new ! It broke the 
traditions. It shows you what sort of a reputation as a 
commander-in-chief the child had made for herself in ten 
days in the field. It was a conquering of men's doubts 
and suspicions and a capturing and solidifying of men's 
belief and confidence such as the grayest veteran on the 
Grand Staff had not been able to achieve in thirty years. 
Don't you remember that when at sixteen Joan conducted 
her own case in a grim court of law and won it, the old 
judge spoke of her as ' this marvellous child ' ? It was the 
right name, you see. 

These veterans were not going to branch out and do 
things without the sanction of the Maid — that is true ; and 
it was a great gain. But at the same time there were some 
among them who still trembled at her new and dashing 
war-tactics and earnestly desired to modify them. And so, 
during the loth, while Joan was slaving away at her plans 
and issuing order after order with tireless industry, the 
old-time consultations and arguings and speechifyings were 
going on among certain of the generals. 

In the afternoon of that day they came in a body to hold 
one of these councils of war ; and while they waited for 
Joan to join them they discussed the situation. Now this 
discussion is not set down in the histories ; but I was there, 
and I will speak of it, as knowing you will trust me, I not 
being given to beguiling you with lies. 

Gautier de Brusac was spokesman for the timid ones ; 
Joan's side was resolutely upheld by D'Alenon, the 
Bastard, La Hire, the Admiral of France, the Marshal de 
Boussac, and all the other really important chiefs. 

De Brusac argued that the situation was very grave ; 
that Jargeau, the first point of attack, was formidably 
strong ; its imposing walls bristling with artillery ; with 
7,000 picked English veterans behind them, and at their 
head the great Earl of Suffolk and his two redoubtable 
brothers, the De la Poles. It seemed to him that the pro- 
posal of Joan of Arc to try to take such a place by storm 
was a most rash and over-daring idea, and she ought to 
be persuaded to relinquish it in favour of the soberer and 
safer procedure of investment by regular siege. It seemed 
to him that this fiery and furious new fashion of hurling 
masses of men against impregnable walls of stone, in defi- 
ance of the established laws and usages of war, was — 

But he got no further. La Hire gave his plumed helm 
an impatient toss and burst out with : 

' By God she knows her trade, and none can teach it 
her!' 

And before he could get out anything more, D'Alenon 
was on his feet, and the Bastard of Orleans, and half a 
dozen others, all thundering at once, and pouring out their 
indignant displeasure upon any and all that might hold, 
secretly or publicly, distrust of the wisdom of the 
Commander-in-Chief. And when they had said their say. La 
Hire took a chance again, and said : 

' There are some that never know how to change. Cir- 
cumstances may change, but those people are never able 
to see that they have got to change too, to meet those cir- 
cumstances. All that they know is the one beaten track 
that their fathers and grandfathers have followed and that 
they themselves have followed in their turn. If an earth- 
quake come and rip the land to chaos, and that beaten 
track now lead over precipices and into morasses, those 
people cafCt learn that they must strike out a new road — 
no ; they will march stupidly along and follow the old one 
to death and perdition. Men, there's a new state of 
things ; and a surpassing military genius has perceived it 
with her clear eye. And a new road is required, and that 
same clear eye has noted where it must go and has marked 
it out for us. The man does not live, never has lived, 
never will live, that can improve upon it ! The old state 
of things was defeat, defeat, defeat — and by consequence 
we had troops with no dash, no heart, no hope. Would 
you assault stone walls with such ? No — there was but 
one way with that kind : sit down before a place and wait, 
wait — starve it out, if you could. The new case is the 
very opposite ; it is this : men all on fire with pluck and 
dash and vim and fury and energy — a restrained conflagra- 
tion ! What would you do with it ? Hold it down and 
let it smoulder and perish and go out ? What would Joan 
of Arc do with it ? Turn it loose, by the Lord God of heaven 
and earth, and let it swallow up the foe in the whirlwind of 
its fires ! Nothing shows the splendour and wisdom of her 
military genius like her instant comprehension of the size 
of the change which has come about, and her instant per- 
ception of the right and only right way to take advantage 
of it. With her is no sitting down and starving out ; no 
dilly-dallying and fooling around ; no lazying, loafing, and 
going to sleep ; no, it is storm ! storm ! storm ! and still 
storm ! storm ! storm ! and forever storm ! storm ! storm ! 
hunt the enemy to his hole, then turn her French hurricanes
