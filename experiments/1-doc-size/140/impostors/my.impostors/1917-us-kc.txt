But Hal stretched out his hands, and silence fell again. 
" Listen to me ! The bosses won't let me talk long, and 
I've something important to say. The union leaders say 
we can't win a strike now." 



 

Consternation came into the faces before him. There 
were cries of dismay. He went on : 

" We are only one camp, and the bosses would turn us 
out, they'd get in scabs and run the mines without us. 
What we must have is a strike of all the camps at once. 
One big union and one big strike ! If we walked out now, 
it would please the bosses; but we'll fool them — we'll 
keep our jobs, and keep our union too ! You are members 
of the union, you'll go on working for the union ! Hooray 
for the North Valley union ! " 

For a moment there was no response. It was hard for 
men to cheer over such a prospect ! Hal saw that he must 
touch a different chord. 

" We mustn't be cowards, boys ! We've got to keep our 
nerve ! I'm doing my part — it took nerve to get in here ! 
In Mrs. Zamboni's clothes, and with two pillows stuffed in 
front of me ! " 

He thumped the pillows, and there was a burst of laugh- 
ter. Many in the crowd knew Mrs. Zamboni — it was 
what comedians call a " local gag." The laughter spread, 
and became a gale of merriment. Men began to cheer: 
" Hurrah for Joe ! You're the girl ! Will you marry me, 
Joe ? " And so, of course, it was easy for Hal to get a re- 
sponse when he shouted, " Hurrah for the North Valley 
union ! " 

Again he raised his hands for silence, and went on 
again. " Listen, men. They'll turn me out, and you're 
not going to resist them. You're going to work and keep 
your jobs, and get ready for the big strike. And you'll 
tell the other men what I say. I can't talk to them all, but 
you tell them about the union. Kemember, there are peo- 
ple outside planning and fighting for you. We're going 
to stand by the union, all of us, till we've brought these 
coal-camps back into America ! " There was a cheer that 
shook the walls of the room. Yes, that was what they 
wanted — to live in America ! 



 

A crowd of men had gathered in the doorway, attracted 
by the uproar ; Hal noticed confusion and pushing, and saw 
the head and burly shoulders of his enemy, Fete Hanun, 
come into sight. 

" Here come the gunmen, boys! " he cried; and there 
was a roar of anger from the crowd. Men turned, clench- 
ing their fists, glaring at the guard. But Hal rushed on, 
quickly : 

" Boys, hear what I say ! Keep your heads ! I can't 
stay in North Valley, and you know it! But I've done 
the thing I came to do, I've brought you the message from 
the union. And you'll tell the other men — tell them to 
stand by the union ! " 

Hal went on, repeating his message over and over. 
Looking from one to another of these toil-worn faces, he 
remembered the pledge he had made them, and he made it 
anew : " I'm going to stand by you ! I'm going on with 
the fight, boys ! " 

There came more disturbance at the door, and suddenly 
Jeff Cotton appeared, with a couple of additional guards, 
shoving their way into the room, breathless and red in the 
face from running. 

" Ah, there's the marshal ! " cried Hal. " You needn't 
push, Cotton, there's not going to be any trouble. We are 
union men here, we know how to control ourselves. Now, 
boys, we're not giving up, we're not beaten, we're only 
waiting for the men in the other camps ! We have a union, 
and we mean to keep it ! Three cheers for the union ! " 

The cheers rang out with a will : cheers for the union, 
cheers for Joe Smith, cheers for the widow and her 
weeds! 

" You belong to the union ! You stand by it, no matter 
what happens! If they fire you, you take it on to the 
next place ! You teach it to the new men, you never let it 
die in your hearts ! In union there is strength, in union 
there is hope ! Never forget it, men — Union I " 




 

The voice of the camp-marshal rang out. " If you're 
coming, young woman, come now ! " 

Hal dropped a shy curtsey. " Oh, Mr. Cotton! This 
is so sudden ! " The crowd howled ; and Hal descended 
from his platform. With coquettish gesturing he replaced 
the widow's veils about his face, and tripped mincingly 
across the dining-room. When he reached the camp- 
marshal, he daintily took that worthy's arm, and with the 
"breaker of teeth" on the other side, and Bud Adams 
bringing up the rear, he toddled out of the dining-room 
and down the street. 

Hungry men gave up their suppers to behold that sight. 
They poured out of the building, they followed, laughing, 
shouting, jeering. Others came from every direction — 
by the time the party had reached the depot, a good part 
of the population of the village was on hand; and every- 
where went the word, " It's Joe Smith ! Come back with 
a message from the union ! " Big, coal-grimed miners 
laughed till the tears made streaks on their faces ; they fell 
on one another's necks for delight at this trick which had 
been played upon their oppressors. 

Even Jeff Cotton could not withhold his tribute. " By 
God, you're the limit ! " he muttered. He accepted the 
" tea-party " aspect of the affair, as the easiest way to get 
rid of his recurrent guest, and avert the possibilities of 
danger. He escorted the widow to the train and helped 
her up the steps, posting escorts at the doors of her car; 
nor did the attentions of these gallants cease until the train 
had moved down the canyon and passed the limits of the 
North Valley stockade!
