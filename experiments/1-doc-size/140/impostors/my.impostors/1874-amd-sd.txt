as busy as bees. The aristocratic part seldom 
joined us, but papa always obeyed the scriptural 
injunction. The lame, and the halt, and the 
blind were hunted up, the whimsical old people 
who would not go without a special invitation, 
the poor who were sure they had nothing to 
wear, and the children who were always ready, 
but needed getting in order. 

Mamma remained behind with baby and Louis. 
I was to act for her as well as I could. The 
stronger portion of the community w r ere to meet 
on the church green and march in regular order. 
Fan had beguiled Dick Fairlie into taking Jen- 
nie Ryder and her mother, who was quite dis- 
abled from a stroke of paralysis two years before. 
All the others were to 0*0 in wagons or stages 
or wheel-barrows, she said. 

Winthrop came over and helped us manage 
the children. At nine we took up our line of 
march under the shady trees. There was a 
shorter way in the sun, but we had time enough. 
This road wound round the hilly district, crossed 
the river once, and then seemed to lose itself, in 
the woods. At least there was the hill and the 
trees on one side. Here a craggy declivity stood 
out bold and brown amid the waving green, 
ferns and wild flowers grew in the clefts, or 
shrubs with precarious footing. A spur of the 
creek ran along the height, and presently be- 
gan to find its way down through a sort of 
sloping river, purling over rocks and stones and 
fallen trees, and in two places pouring down a 
precipitous pathway, making very pretty falls, 
the larger one at least ten feet high. Then it 
ran off and joined the river. 

There was one lovely nook, though art had 
assisted nature here. A clearing had been made 
years ago, and now the turf of clover and grass 
was like velvet. 

It was a small basin between the mountains. 
Down one side of it came the cascade, wandering 
off through the woods in curves that made a 
picturesque way. The place was used consider- 
ably for pleasure parties, and kept in tolerable 
order. The committee had been down the day 
before, put up swings, made some long tables and 
seats, and given the place quite a homelike air. 

The walk was beautiful with varied scenery, 
fresh, crisp air, and clearest of skies. Mr. Ogden 
made acquaintance with Mr. Trafton, our super- 
intendent, in about five minutes, and they mar- 
shalled the children in a jolly fashion. All heavy 



 

baskets and bundles were put in a great farm 
wagon, and we had nothing to do but march 
along triumphantly to the carol of the birds. 

The youngsters were wild, of course. They 
shouted at a little gray squirrel which ran along 
the path, they gave sundry shrill whistles that 
exceeded the birds, they laughed and chattered, 
stepped out of line to gather wild flowers or pick 
up some uncommon pebble, beginning their day's 
pleasure at the very outset. But papa did not 
care. Indeed he was as merry as any of them. 

I thought several times how Stephen Duncan 
would have liked it. I wondered what should 
have brought him so plainly before my mind on 
this particular day ! 

Through winding ways we trooped. Over 
beyond there were broad meadows and waving 
corn-fields, scattered farm buildings and cottages, 
with a bit of road, gleaming dusty white in the 
sunshine, the river broadening into lakes or 
bending abruptly ; and nearer, the changing 
glooms and shadows, the points of the hills in 
blue and purple and bronze. All the air was so 
clear and sweet, it sent the rushes of warm blood 
to heart and brain, and then to very finger 
ends. 



 

The infantry, as Winthrop called it, reached 
the ground a long while first. We had to dis< 
band and the children ran around as if they had 
Ziever seen a bit of country before. Shawls and 
baskets were stowed in out-of-the-way corners 
or suspended from trees. Some of the hardier 
boys pulled off shoes and stockings, preparatory 
to having a good time. As for us elders, we 
began to straighten out our affairs and set up 
for house-keeping. There were so many lovely 
people. Miss Oldways, who taught the bible- 
class of larger girls, in her soft, pearl gray dress, 
and ribbon of the same shade on her bonnet, 
with a bit of pale blue inside. She was always 
so sweet and lady-like. She and her widowed 
sister, Mrs. Bromley, kept a little thread and 
needle store in the village, and, though they 
were business women, I did not see that it de- 
tracted in the least from their refinement. 

Annie and Chris Fellows were with us, and 
Mrs. Elsden, though she had four children in 
ihe Sunday School, but I think she would have 
enjoyed herself any way. Mrs. Fairlie and Kate 
had gone to the sea-shore the day before, with 
the Wests and some others. Then there were 
Mothers and Aunts of the children, and several 
of the farmer families near by. 

We had stowed our luggage in a cool, shady 
place and sent the wagon home when the cara^ 
van arrived. Old ladies who could not have 
walked, but were in holiday white apron and 
kerchief, or Lest gingham dress, and some with 
their knitting. We placed shawls on the mossy 
rocks or benches, and seated them. 

"Here is your precious cargo," said Dick to 
Fannie. "Come and welcome them." 

" Oh, Mrs. Ryder, I am so glad you could 
come.'
