Mr. Dosson, that afternoon, sitting by Francie s 
bedside, read out from the copy of the Re 
verberator which he had purchased on the 
boulevard the dreadful " piece " to his two 
daughters. It is a remarkable fact that as a family 
they were rather disappointed in this compo 
sition, in which their curiosity found less to repay 
it than it had expected, their resentment against 
Mr. Flack less to stimulate it, their imaginative 
effort to take the point of view of the Proberts 
less to sustain it, and their acceptance of the 
promulgation of Francie s innocent remarks as a 
natural incident of the life of the day less to 
make them reconsider it. The letter from Paris 
appeared lively, " chatty," even brilliant, and so 
far as the personalities contained in it were 
concerned Mr. Dosson wanted to know if they 
were not aware over here of the charges brought 


every day against the most prominent men in 
Boston. " If there was anything in that style 
they might talk," he said ; and he scanned the 
effusion afresh with a certain surprise at not 
finding in it some imputation of pecuniary mal 
versation. The effect of an acquaintance with 
the text was to depress Delia, who did not exactly 
see what there was in it to take back or explain 
away. However, she was aware there were some 
points they didn 't understand, and doubtless these 
were the scandalous places the things that had 
thrown the Proberts into a state. But why should 
they be in a state if other people didn 't under 
stand the allusions they were peculiar, but 
peculiarly incomprehensible any better than she 
did ? The whole thing struck Francie as infinitely 
less lurid than Mme. de Brecourt s account of it, 
and the part about herself and her portrait seemed 
to make even less of the subject than it easily 
might have done. It was scanty, it was " skimpy," 
and if Mr. Waterlow was offended it would not be 
because they had published too much about him. 
If was nevertheless clear to her that there were a 
lot of things that she had not told Mr. Flack, as well 
as a great many that she had : perhaps these were 
the things that that lady had put in Florine or 
Dorine the one she had mentioned at Mmc. 
de Brecourt s. 

All the same, if the communication in the Re 
verberator gave them at the hotel less of a sensa- 





tion than had been announced and bristled so much 
less than was to have been feared with explana 
tions of the anguish of the Proberts, this did not 
diminish the girl s sense of responsibility nor make 
the case a whit less grave. It only showed how sensitive and fastidious the Proberts were and therefore 
with what difficulty they could forgive. Moreover 
Francie made another reflection as she lay there for 
Delia kept her in bed nearly three days, feeling that 
for the moment at any rate that was an effectual reply to the wish she had signified that they should 
leave Paris. Perhaps they had got coarse and callous, 
Francie said to herself; perhaps they had read so 
many articles like that that they had lost their deli 
cacy, the sense of certain differences and decencies. 
Then, very weak and vague and passive as she was 
now, in the bedirnmed room, in the soft Parisian bed, 
and with Delia treating her as much as possible 
like a sick person, she thought of the lively and 
chatty letters that they had always seen in the 
papers and wondered whether they all meant a 
violation of sanctities, a convulsion of homes, a 
burning of smitten faces, a rupture of girls engage 
ments. It was present to her as an agreeable nega 
tive, I must add, that her father and sister took no 
strenuous view of her responsibility or of their own : 
they neither brought the matter up to her as a crime 
nor made her worse through her feeling that they 
hovered about in tacit disapproval. There was a 
pleasant, cheerful helplessness in her father in regard 





to this as in regard to everything else. There could 
be no more discussion among them on such a ques 
tion than there had ever been, for none was needed 
to illustrate the fact that for these candid minds the 
newspapers and all they contained were a part of 
the general fatality of things, of the recurrent fresh 
ness of the universe, coming out like the sun in 
the morning or the stars at night. The thing that 
worried Francie most while Delia kept her in bed 
was the apprehension of what her father might 
do : but this was not a fear of what he might do 
to Mr. Flack. He would go round perhaps to Mr. 
Probert s or to Mme. de Brecourt s to reprimand 
them for having made things so rough for his 
" chicken." It was true she had scarcely ever seen 
him reprimand any one for anything ; but on the 
other hand nothing like that had ever happened 
before to her or to Delia. They had made each 
other cry once or twice but no one else had ever 
made them, and no one had ever broken out on 
them that way and frightened them half to death. 
Francie wanted her father not to go round; she 
had a sense that those other people had somehow 
stores of censure, of superiority in any discussion, 
which he could not command. She wanted nothing 
done and no communication to pass only a 
proud, unbickering silence on the part of the 
Dossons. If the Proberts made a noise and they 
made none it would be they who would have the 
best appearance. Moreover, now, with each elaps- 







ing day she felt that she did wish to see Gaston 
about it. Her desire was to wait, counting the 
hours, so that she might just explain, saying two 
or three things. Perhaps these things would not 
make it better very likely they would not ; but 
at any rate nothing would have been done in the 
interval, at least on her part and her father s and 
Delia s, to make it worse. She told her father 
that she should not like him to go round, and 
she was in some degree relieved at perceiving 
that he did not seem very clear as to what it was 
open to him to say to the Proberts. He was not 
afraid but he was vague. His relation to almost 
everything that had happened to them as a family
