and the marquis, whose mastery of English was 
small and their other distractions great. Mr. Pro- 
bert, it was true, had shown something of a frater 
nising spirit ; he had come twice to the hotel, since 
his son s departure, and he had said, smiling and 
reproachful, " You neglect us, you neglect us ! " 
Mr. Dosson had not understood what he meant 
by this till Delia explained after the visitor with 
drew, and even then the remedy for the neglect, 
administered two or three days later, had not 
borne any particular fruit. Mr. Dosson called 
alone, instructed by his daughter, in the Cours la 
Reine, but Mr. Probert was not at home. He only 
left a card, on which Delia had superscribed in 
advance the words " So sorry ! " Her father had 
told her he would give the card if she wanted, but 
he would have nothing to do with the writing. 
There was a discussion as to whether Mr. Probert s 
remark was an allusion to a deficiency of polite 
ness on the article of his sons-in-law. Ought not 
Mr. Dosson perhaps to call personally, and not 
simply through the medium of the visits paid by 
his daughters to their wives, on Messieurs de 
Brecourt and de Cliche ? Once, when this sub 
ject came up in George Flack s presence, the old 





man said he would go round if Mr. Flack would 
accompany him. " All right ! " said Mr. Flack, 
and this conception became a reality, with the 
accidental abatement that the objects of the de 
monstration were absent. " Suppose they get in ? " 
Delia had said lugubriously to her sister. 

".Well, what if they do ? " Francie asked. 

" Why, the count and the marquis won 't be 
interested in Mr. Flack." 

"Well then, perhaps he will be interested in 
them. He can write something about them. 
They will like that." 

" Do you think they would ? " Delia demanded, 
in solemn dubiousness. 

" Why, yes, if he should say fine things." 

" They do like fine things," said Delia. " They 
get off so many themselves. Only the way Mr. 
Flack does it it s a different style." 

t( Well, people like to be praised in any style." 

" That s so," Delia rejoined, musingly. 

One afternoon, coming in about three o clock, 
Mr. Flack found Francie alone. She had ex 
pressed a wish, after luncheon, for a couple of 
hours of independence : she intended to write to 
Gaston, and having accidentally missed a post 
promised herself that her letter should be of 
double its usual length. Her companions respected her desire for solicitude, Mr. Dosson taking 
himself off to his daily session in the reading-room 
of the American bank and Delia (the girls had 



now a luxurious coach at their command) driving 
away to the dressmaker s, a frequent errand, to 
superintend and urge forward the progress of her 
sister s wedding-clothes. Francie was not skilled 
in composition ; she wrote slowly and in addressing her lover had a painful sense of literary responsibility. Her father and Delia had a theory 
that when she shut herself up that way she poured 
forth wonderful pages it was part of her high 
cultivation. At any rate, when George Flack was 
ushered in she was still bending over her blotting- 
book on one of the gilded tables and there was an 
inkstain on her pointed forefinger. It was no dis 
loyalty to Gaston but only at the most a sense of 
weariness in regard to the epistolary form that 
made her glad to see her visitor. She didn 't know 
how to finish her letter ; but Mr. Flack seemed in 

a manner to terminate it. 

" I wouldn 't have ventured to propose this, but I 

guess I can do with it, now it s come," the young 

man announced. 

" What can you do with ? " she asked, wiping 

her pen. 

"Well this happy chance. Just you and me 

together." 

" I don 't know what it s a chance for." 

" Well, for me to be a little less miserable for a 

quarter of an hour. It makes me so to see you 

look so happy." 

" It makes you miserable ? " 





" You ought to understand, when I say some 
thing magnanimous." And settling himself on 
the sofa Mr. Flack continued, " Well, how do you 
get on without Mr. Probert ? " 

Very well indeed, thank you." 

The tone in which the girl spoke was not an en 
couragement to free pleasantry, so that if Mr. Flack 
continued his inquiries it was in a guarded and 
respectful manner. He was eminently capable of 
reflecting that it was not in his interest to strike 
her as indiscreet and profane , he only wanted to 
appear friendly, worthy of confidence. At the 
same time he was not averse to the idea that she 
should still perceive in him a certain sense of in 
jury, and that could be indicated only by a touch 
of bitterness here and there. The injury, the 
bitterness might make her pity him. " Well, you 
are in the grand monde, I suppose he resumed at 
last, not with an air of derision but resignedly, 
sympathetically.
