curio iisly and looked at the dead men's faces. He knew 
neither of them, and told the surgeon so. 

' Will you allow me to see the lady ? ' he asked. 

' Pardon me, if I ask a question,' said the surgeon, who 
was a man of middle age, with a red beard and keen gray 
eyes. ' To whom have I the advantage of speaking ? ' 

' Signer Professore,' replied San Giacinto. ' I must tell you 
that if this is the lady I suppose your patient to be, the 






honour of one of the greatest families in Eome is concerned, 
and it is important that strict secrecy should be preserved.' 

'The porter told me that you were a Eoman prince,' 
returned the surgeon rather bluntly. ' But you speak like a 
southerner.' 

' I was brought up in Naples. As I was saying, secrecy 
is very important, and I can assure you that you will earn 
the gratitude of many by assisting me.' 

' Do you wish to take this lady away at once ? ' 

' Heaven forbid ! Her mother and sister shall come for 
her in half an hour.' 

The surgeon thrust his hands into his pockets, and stood 
staring for a moment or two at the bodies of the Zouaves. 

'I cannot do it,' he said, suddenly looking up at San 
Giacinto. I am master here, and I am responsible. The 
secret is professional, of course. If I knew you, even by 
sight, I should not hesitate. As it is, I must ask your name.' 

San Giacinto did not hesitate long, as the surgeon was 
evidently master of the situation. He took a card from his 
case and silently handed it to the doctor. The latter took it 
and read the name, ' Don Giovanni Saracinesca, Marchese di 
San Giacinto. His face betrayed no emotion, but the belief 
flashed through his mind that there was no such person in 
existence. He was one of the leading men in his profession, 
and knew Prince Saracinesca and Sant' Ilario, but he had 
never heard of this other Don Giovanni. He knew also that 
the city was in a state of revolution and that many suspicious 
persons were likely to gain access to public buildings on false 
pretences. 

' Very well,' he said quietly. ' You are not afraid of dead 
men, I see. Be good enough to wait a moment here no one 
will see you, and you will not be recognised I will go and 
see that there is nobody in the way, and you shall have a 
sight of the young lady.' 

His companion nodded in assent and the surgeon went 
out through the narrow door. San Giacinto was surprised 
to hear the heavy key turned in the lock and withdrawn, but 
immediately accounted for the fact on the theory that the 
surgeon wished to prevent any one from finding his visitor 




lest the secret should be divulged. He was not a nervous 
man, and had no especial horror of being left alone in a mor 
tuary chamber for a few minutes. He looked about him, and 
saw that the room was high and vaulted. One window alone 
gave air, and this was ten feet from the floor and heavily 
ironed. He reflected with a smile that if it pleased the 
surgeon to leave him there he could not possibly get out. 
Neither his size nor his phenomenal strength could assist him 
in the least. There was no furniture in the place. Half a 
dozen slabs of slate for the bodies were built against the wall, 
solid and immovable, and the door was of the heaviest oak, 
thickly studded with huge iron nails. If the dead men had 
been living prisoners their place of confinement could not 
have been more strongly contrived. 

San Giacinto waited a quarter of an hour, and at last, 
as the surgeon did not return, he sat down upon one of the 
marble slabs and, being very hungry, consoled himself by 
lighting a cigar, while he meditated upon the surest means 
of conveying Donna Faustina to her father's house. At last 
he began to wonder how long he was to wait. 

I should not wonder,' he said to himselfj ' if that long- 
eared professor had taken me for a revolutionist.' 

He was not far wrong, indeed. The surgeon had despatched 
\ messenger for a couple of gendarmes and had gone about 
nis business in the hospital, knowing very well that it would 
take some time to find the police while the riot lasted, and 
congratulating himself upon having caught a prisoner who, if 
not a revolutionist, was at all events an impostor, since he 
had a card printed with a false name. 



CHAPTER VI 

THE improvised banquet at the Palazzo Saracinesca was not 
a merry one, but the probable dangers to the city and the 
disappearance of Faustina Montevarchi furnished matter for 
plenty of conversation. The majority inclined to the belief 
that the girl had lost her head and had run home, but as 
neither Sant' Ilario nor his cousin returned, there was much 


 

speculation. The prince said he believed that they had 
found Faustina at her father's house and had stayed to 
dinner, whereupon some malicious person remarked that it 
needed a revolution in Kome to produce hospitality in such 
a quarter. 

Dinner was nearly ended when Pasquale, the butler, 
whispered to the prince that a gendarme wanted to speak 
with him on very important business. 

' Bring him here,' answered old Saracinesca, aloud. 
' There is a gendarme outside,' he added, addressing his 
guests, ' he will tell us all the news. Shall we have him 
here ? ' 

Every one assented enthusiastically to the proposition, for 
most of those present were anxious about their houses, not 
knowing what had taken place during the last two hours. 
The man was ushered in, and stood at a distance holding his 
three-cornered hat in his hand, and looking rather sheepish 
and uncomfortable. 

' Well ? ' asked the prince. ' What is the matter ? We 
all wish to hear the news.'
