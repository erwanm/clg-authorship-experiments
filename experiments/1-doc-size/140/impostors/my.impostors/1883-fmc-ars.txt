little bits of lead, several times. At last he was 
rewarded. Very slowly the window opened, and 
Hedwig's voice spoke in a low tone : 

"Is it you?" 

" Ah, dear one I Can you ask ? " began Nino. 

"Hush! I am still locked up. We are going 
away, I cannot tell where." 

" When, dearest love ? " 

"I cannot tell. What shall we do?" very tearfully. 

" I will follow you immediately ; only let me know 
when and where." 

" If you do not hear by some other means, come 
here to-morrow night. I hear steps. Go at on-ce." 

" Good-night, dearest," he murmured ; but the win 
dow was already closed, and the fresh breeze that 
springs up after one o clock blew from the air the 
remembrance of the loving speech that had passed 
upon it, 

On the following night he was at his post, and 
again threw the shot against the pane for a signal. 
After a long time Hedwig opened the window very 
cautiously. 

" Quick I " she whispered down to him, " go I they 



 

are all awake," and she dropped something heavy and 
white. Perhaps she added some word, but Nino 
would not tell me, and never would read me the letter. But it contained the news that Hedwig and her 
father were to leave Rome for Paris on the following 
morning ; and ever since that night Nino has worn 
upon his little finger a plain gold ring, I cannot 
tell why, and he says he found it. 

The next day he ascertained from the porter of the 
Palazzo Carmandola that the count and contessina, 
with their servants, had actually left Rome that 
morning for Paris. From that moment he was sad 
as death, and went about his business heavily, being 
possessed of but one idea, namely, to sign an engagement to sing in Paris as soon as possible. In that 
wicked city the opera continues through Lent, and 
after some haggling, in which De Pretis insisted on 
obtaining for Nino the most advantageous terms, the 
contract was made out and signed. 

I see very well that unless I hurry myself I shall 
never reach the most important part of this story, 
which is, after all, the only part worth telling. I 
am sure I do not know how I can ever tell it so 
quickly, but I will do my best, and you must have 
a little patience ; for though I am not old, I am not 
young, and Nino's departure for Paris was a great 
shock to me, so that I do not like to remember it, 
and the very thought of it sickens me. If you have 
ever had any education, you must have seen an experiment in which a mouse is put in a glass jar, and 
all the air is drawn away with a pump, so that the 
poor little beast languishes and rolls pitifully on its 



 

side, gasping and wheezing with its tiny lungs for 
the least whiff of air. That is just how I felt when 
Nino went away. It seemed as though I could not 
breathe in the house or in the streets, and the little 
rooms at home were so quiet that one might hear a 
pin fall, and the cat purring through the closed 
doors. Nino left at the beginning of the last ten 
days of Carnival, when the opera closed, so that it 
was soon Lent ; and everything is quieter then. 

But before he left us there was noise enough and 
bustle of preparation, and I did not think I should 
miss him; for he always was making music, or 
walking about, or doing something to disturb me, 
just at the very moment when I was most busy with 
my books. Mariuccia, indeed, would ask me from 
time to time what I should do when Nino was gone, 
as if she could foretell what I was to feel. I suppose she knew I was used to him, after fourteen 
years of it, and would be inclined to black humours 
for want of his voice. But she could not know just 
what Nino is to me, nor how I look on him as my 
own boy. These peasants are quick-witted and 
foolish ; they guess a great many things better 
than I could, and then reason on them like idiots. 

Nino himself was glad to go. I could see his face 
grow brighter as the time approached; and though 
he appeared to be more successful than ever in his 
singing, I am sure that he cared nothing for the applause he got, and thought only of singing as well 
as he could for the love of it. But when it came 
to the parting, we were left alone. 

" Messer Cornelio," he said, looking at me affectionately, " I have something to say to you to-night, 
before I go away." 

" Speak, then, my dear boy," I answered, " for 
no one hears us." 

" You have been very good to me. A father 
could not have loved me better, and such a father as 
I had could not have done a thousandth part what 
you have done for me. I am going out into the 
world for a time, but my home is here, or, rather, 
where my home is will always be yours. You have 
been my father, and I will be your son ; and it is time 
you should give up your professorship. No, not that 
you are at all old ; I do not mean that." 

" No, indeed," said I, " I should think not." 

" It would be much more proper if you retired 
into an elegant leisure, so that you might write as 
many books as you desire, without wearing yourself 
out in teaching those students every day. Would you 
not like to go back to Serveti ? " 

" Serveti ! ah, beautiful, lost Serveti, with its 
castle and good vinelands ! " 

" You shall have it again before long, my father," 
he said. He had never called me father before, the 
dear boy ! I suppose it was because he was going 
away. But Serveti again I The thing was impos 
sible, and I said so. 

" It is not impossible," he answered placidly. " Successful singers make enough money in a year to buy
