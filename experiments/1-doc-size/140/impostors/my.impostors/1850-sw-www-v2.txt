people often do, she judged only from the outside ; Jenny 
had not made such a bad choice after all. 

The doctor said he would go directly to Mr. Van Brunt 
after he had been over to Mrs. Sibnorth's ; it wouldn't be a 
minute. Ellen meant to ride back in his company ; and 
having finished her dinner waited now only for him. But the 
one minute passed — two minutes — ten — twenty — she waited 
impatiently, but he came not. 

" I'll tell you how it must be," said his sister, — " he's gone 
off without his dinner calculating to get it at Miss Hitchcock's, 
— he'd be glad of the chance. That's how it is, dear ; and 
you'll have to ride home alone ; I'm real sorry. S'pose you 
stop tin eyening, and I'll make the doctor go along with you. 







But oh dear ! maybe he wouldn't be able to neither ; he's 
got to go up to that tiresome Mrs. Robin's ; it's too bad. 
Well take good care of yourself darling ; — couldn't you stop 
till it's cooler ? — well come and see me as soon as you can 
again, but don't come without someone else along ! Good- 
bye ! I wish I could keep you," 

She went to the door to see her mount, and smiled and 
nodded her off, 

Ellen was greatly refreshed with her rest and her dinner ; 
it grieved her, that the Brownie had not fared as well. All 
the refreshment that kind words and patting could give him, 
she gave ; promised him the freshest of water and the sweet- 
est of hay when he should reach home ; and begged him to 
keep up his spirits and hold on for a little longer. It may be 
doubted whether the Brownie understood the full sense of 
her words, but he probably knew what the kind tones and 
gentle hand meant. He answered cheerfully tlirew up his 
head and gave a little neigh, as much as to say, he wa.sn't 
going to mind a few hours of sunshine ; and trotted on as if 
he knew his face was towards home, — which no doubt he did. 
Luckily it was not a very hot day ; for August, it was remarkably cjooI and beautiful; indeed there was little very hot 
weather ever known in Thirlwall. Ellen's heart felt easier, 
now that her business was done ! and when she had left the 
town behind her and was again in the fields, she was less timid 
than she had been before ; she was going towards home ; 
that makes a great difference ; and every step was bringing 
her nearer. " I am glad I came, after all," she thought ; — " but 
I hope I shall never have to do such a tiling again. But I 
am glad I came." 

She had no more than crossed the little bridge however, 
when she saw what brought her heart into her mouth. It 
was Mr. Saunders, lolling under a tree. What could he have 
come there for at that time of day ? A vague feeling crossed 
her mind that if she could only get past him she should pass 
a danger ; she thought to ride by without seeming to see 
him, and quietly gave the Brownie a pat to make him go 
faster. But as she drew near Mr. Saunders rose up, came 
to the middle of the road, and taking hold of her bridle 
checked her pony's pace so that he could walk alongside ; to 
Ellen's unspeakable dismay. 







" What's kept you so long ?" said he ; — " I've been looking out for you this great while. Had hard work to find the 
doctor?" 

" Won't you please to let go of my horse," said Ellen, her 
heart beating very fast ; — " I am in a great hurry to get 
home ; — please. don't keep me." 

"I want to see you a little," said Mr. Saunders ; — " you 
aint in such a hurry to get away from me as that comes to, 
are you ?" 

Ellen was silent. 

" It's quite a long time since I saw you last," said he ; — 
how have the merinos worn ?" 

Ellen could not bear to look at his face and did not see the 
expression which went with these words, yet she ftlt it." 

''They have worn very well," said she, "but I want to 
get home very much — 'please let me e^o." 

"Not yet — not yet," said he, — " O no, not yet. I want to 
talk to you ; why what are you in such a devil of a hurry 
for ? I came out on purpose ; do you think I am going to 
have all my long waiting for nothing ?" 

Ellen did not know what to say ; her heart sprang with a 
nameless pang to the thought, if she ever got free from this ! 
Meanwhile she was not free. 

"Whose horse is that you're on?" 

" Mine," said Ellen. 

" Your'n ! that's a likely story. I guess he aint your'n, 
and so you won't mind if I touch him up a little ; — I want to 
see how well you can sit a horse." 

Passing his arm through the bridle as he said these words, 
Mr. Saunders led the pony down to the side of the road where 
grew a clump of high bushes ; and with some trouble cut off 
a long stout sapling. Ellen looked in every direction while 
he was doing this, despairing, as she looked, of aid from any 
quarter of the broad quiet open country. O for wings ! But 
she could not leave the Brownie if she had them. 

Returning to the middle of the road, Mr. Saunders amused 
himself as they walked along with stripping off all the leaves 
and little twigs from his sapling, leaving it when done a very- 
good imitation of an ox-whip in size and length, with a fine 
lash-like point. Ellen watched him in an ecstasy of apprehension, afraid alike to speak or to be silent. 

 







" There ! what do you think of that V* said he, giving it 
two or three switches in the air to try its suppleness and 
toughness ; — " don't that look like a whip ? Now we'll see 
how he'll go!" 

" Please don't do anything with it," said Ellen earnestly ; 
— " I never touch him with a whip, — he doesn't need it, — he
