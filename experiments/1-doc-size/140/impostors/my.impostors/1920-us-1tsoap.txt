And the other man took the paper from him. “I’ll read it to you,” he
said. “Now you listen, and put your mind on it, and make sure I’ve
got it all right.”

And so Guffey started to read an elaborate legal document: “I, Peter
Gudge, being duly sworn do depose and declare--” and so on. It was
an elaborate and detailed story about a man named Jim Goober, and
his wife and three other men, and how they had employed Peter to buy
for them certain materials to make bombs, and how Peter had helped
them to make the bombs in a certain room at a certain given address,
and how they had put the bombs in a suit-case, with a time clock to
set them off, and how Isaacs, the jitney driver, had driven them to
a certain corner on Main Street, and how they had left the suit-case
with the bombs on the street in front of the Preparedness Day
parade.

It was very simple and clear, and Peter, as he listened, was almost
ready to cry with delight, realizing that this was all he had to do
to escape from his horrible predicament. He knew now what he was
supposed to know; and he knew it. Why had not Guffey told him long
ago, so that he might have known it without having his fingers bent
out of place and his wrist twisted off?

“Now then,” said Guffey, “that’s your confession, is it?”

“Y-y-yes,” said Peter.

“And you’ll stand by it to the end?”

“Y-y-yes, sir.”

“We can count on you now? No more nonsense?”

“Y-y-yes, sir.”

“You swear it’s all true?”

“I do.”

“And you won’t let anybody persuade you to go back on it--no matter
what they say to you?”

“N-n-no, sir,” said Peter.

“All right,” said Guffey; and his voice showed the relief of a
business man who has closed an important deal. He became almost
human as lie went on. “Now, Peter,” he said, “you’re our man, and
we’re going to count on you. You understand, of course, that we have
to hold you as a witness, but you’re not to be a prisoner, and we’re
going to treat you well. We’ll put you in the hospital part of the
jail, and you’ll have good grub and nothing to do. In a week or so,
we’ll want you to appear before the grand jury. Meantime, you
understand--not a word to a soul! People may try to worm something
out of you, but don’t you open your mouth about this case except to
me. I’m your boss, and I’ll tell you what to do, and I’ll take care
of you all the way. You got that all straight?”

“Y-y-yes, sir,” said Peter.




Section 8


There was once, so legend declares, a darky who said that he liked
to stub his toe because it felt so good when it stopped hurting. On
this same principle Peter had a happy time in the hospital of the
American City jail. He had a comfortable bed, and plenty to eat, and
absolutely nothing to do. His sore joints became gradually healed,
and he gained half a pound a day in weight, and his busy mind set to
work to study the circumstances about him, to find out how he could
perpetuate these comfortable conditions, and add to them the little
luxuries which make life really worth living.

In charge of this hospital was an old man by the name of Doobman. He
had been appointed because he was the uncle of an alderman, and he
had held the job for the last six years, and during that time had
gained weight almost as rapidly as Peter was gaining. He had now
come to a condition where he did not like to get out of his armchair
if it could be avoided. Peter discovered this, and so found it
possible to make himself useful in small ways. Also Mr. Doobman had
a secret vice; he took snuff, and for the sake of discipline he did
not want this dreadful fact to become known. Therefore he would wait
until everybody’s back was turned before he took a pinch of snuff;
and Peter learned this, and would tactfully turn his back.

Everybody in this hospital had some secret vice, and it was Mr.
Doobman’s duty to repress the vices of the others. The inmates of
the hospital included many of the prisoners who had money, and could
pay to make themselves comfortable. They wanted tobacco, whiskey,
cocaine and other drugs, and some of them wanted a chance to
practice unnamable horrors. All the money they could smuggle in they
were ready to spend for license to indulge themselves. As for the
attendants in the hospital, they were all political appointees,
derelicts who had been unable to hold a job in the commercial world,
and had sought an easy berth, like Peter himself. They took bribes,
and were prepared to bribe Peter to outwit Mr. Doobman; Mr. Doobman,
on the other hand, was prepared to reward Peter with many favors, if
Peter would consent to bring him secret information. In such a
situation it was possible for a man with his wits about him to
accumulate quite a little capital.

For the most part Peter stuck by Doobman; having learned by bitter
experience that in the long run it pays to be honest. Doobman was
referred to by the other attendants as the “Old Man”; and always in
Peter’s life, from the very dawn of childhood, there had been some
such “Old Man,” the fountain-head of authority, the dispenser of
creature comforts. First had been “Old Man” Drubb, who from early
morning until late at night wore green spectacles, and a sign across
his chest, “I am blind,” and made a weary little child lead him thru
the streets by the hand. At night, when they got home to their
garret-room, “Old Man” Drubb would take off his green goggles, and
was perfectly able to see Peter, and if Peter had made the slightest
mistake during the day he would beat him.

When Drubb was arrested, Peter was taken to the orphan asylum, and
there was another “Old Man,” and the same harsh lesson of
subservience to be learned. Peter had run away from the asylum; and
then had come Pericles Priam with his Pain Paralyzer, and Peter had
studied his whims and served his interests. When Pericles had
married a rich widow and she had kicked Peter out, there had come
the Temple of Jimjambo, where the “Old Man” had been Tushbar
Akrogas, the major-domo--terrible when he was thwarted, but a
generous dispenser of favors when once you had learned to flatter
him, to play upon his weaknesses, to smooth the path of his
pleasures. All these years Peter had been forced to “crook the
pregnant hinges of the knee”; it had become an instinct with him--an
instinct that went back far behind the twenty years of his conscious
life, that went back twenty thousand years, perhaps ten times twenty
thousand years, to a time when Peter had chipped flint spear-heads
at the mouth of some cave, and broiled marrow-bones for some “Old
Man” of the borde, and seen rebellious young fellows cast out to
fall prey to the sabre-tooth tiger.
