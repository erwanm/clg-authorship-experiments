" If that will not satisfy Aunt Adelaide, the rest must 
come out of Maud's own money: of that I am re 
solved." 





It came to an issue sooner than they expected. Mrs. 
Garland had the good sense to see, that, at present, it 
would not be wisdom to take charge of Maud, granting 
that her father might be induced to consent. She could 
go to school for three }*ears ; and, after that, Aunt Gar 
land could "bring her out." By that time, the interest 
of her money would be a considerable sum, enough to 
support her, independent of her father. 

' ' But a paltry hundred dollars ! ' ' she said when Maud 
stated her affairs. " You want a nice summer silk and a 
winter silk. "We will do our best with them, and then 
write to your father. I daresay that remarkable baby is 
swaddled in the finest of linen and lace." 

Aunt Adelaide had discovered a wonderful dressmaker, 
a poor young girl with charming taste and deft ability , 
and who worked for a dollar a day and her board. The 
two dresses were skilfully fashioned, one or two altered ; 
and then the doctor was applied to for more means. 

He explained his plan, and enclosed a check for fifty 
dollars. There would be but fifty more to last her until 
next July. He particularly desired that Aunt Adelaide 
would purchase her some useful school-dresses. 

"It is just as I expected, nry dear Maud," said her 
aunt angrily. " You lost your best friend when you lost 
your mother. And, if your father had treated me as I 
should have bsen treated, I do not think I should ever 
have left you. I always told him that I was quite read_y to 
devote rrry whole life to ' my poor dead sister's ' children. 
But he had to be foolish enough to many that ignorant 
young thing, who rules him completely, and who grudges 
you every dollar. I don't know how you will be able to 
endure it." 

Maud cried a little, and believed herself a very ill-used 
young woman with a cruel stepmother. 

But, after two or three weeks, she decided secretly , that 
it was not extravagantly delightful here. There were no 

 

exhilarating drives in the Park, no stylish callers with 
gossip of opera and theatre. The shopping was soon 
clone ; and she did not know any girls with whom she 
could have a good time. She began to feel very lone 
some, and wonder whether being " Dr. Kinnard's daugh 
ter" was not more enlivening. Still her pride would not 
admit of her going home before the last moment. 

Mrs. Garland made her husband take them to Long 
Branch for a day .or two. Maud looked at the elegant 
dressing and showy equipages with an envious eye. Mr. 
Garland was no longer the devoted lover of a rich 
woman, but a commonplace, selfish husband, with a strait 
ened purse. Maud's quick eye drew rather unfavorable 
contrasts between him and her father. Altogether the 
visit was not as productive of evil as it might have been 
under more favorable circumstances. Aunt Adelaide 
was growing fretful. 

At home, it must be admitted, they felt relieved. Ber 
tie was developing into a well-behaved, chivalrous boy, 
and absolute!y improving in good looks. Grandmother 
was a little childish and captious at times ; but no one ran 
against the sharp points when they bristled outwardly. 
Moreover, she was coming to have a great respect for the 
Endicott girls. To think that Miss Bessie, without a 
penny, was about to marry into a rich and stylish family, 
and that her mother-in-law elect thought the ground was 
hardly good enough for " Queenic " to walk on; that 
she should be taken to London and Paris and Rome, 
where it was hardly likely Dr. Kinnard's wife would ever 
go ; that she should receive this wonderful good-fortune 
in such a simply pretty way, without being at all " puffed 
up with pride," was quite a marvel. When she came 
over, she always would dress up grandmother in carnation- 
pinks and heliotrope. 

" I am too old," Mrs. Kinnard would say. "Put 
them in your own shining hair." 



 

" One is never too old to be made pretty," she would 
rejoin in her rapid, rippling way, that reminded yvu. of 
nothing so much as a swallow's flight in the sunshine. 

They had been greatly at loss in choosing a name for 
the wonderful baby. Every thing, almost, had been "tried 
on." At last, they settled to the appellations of the two 
grandmothers, Frances Annie. It was to be christ 
ened in the new church ; and dear old papa was coming 
over for the Sunday. 

" Nelly," said her husband, " I have asked Mr. Dudley 
to stand for baby. I think he was very much pleased. 
I don't know a man that I honor and esteem higher than 
Arthur Dudley, except your father ; " and he smiled. 

" Oh, how strange ! I don't know" in a wondering, 
hesitating way. " But it can't make any difference. I 
asked Daisy this morning. We have grown so near to 
gether this summer, and she adores baby. Besides, she is 
a good, conscientious girl." 

" I wish it could make a difference ; " and there was a 
breathless impatience in the doctor's tone. "If it only 
would ! Why can't they see how they are fitted for one 
another? She is the only ' clergyman's wife ' that your 
mother has raised ; and I cannot bear to see her miss her 
vocation."

It contented him in staying. It brought him into active,
