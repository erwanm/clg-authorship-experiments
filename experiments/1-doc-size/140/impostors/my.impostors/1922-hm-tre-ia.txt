you'd like to get off your chest, doctors and priests 
are in the same boat." 

With no little effort —  for the right words had a 
way of tumbling back out of reach —  he marshalled 
his phrases, and as he uttered them, closed his eyes 
to lessen the possibility of a break. "I'm only a 
benighted fool; and having said that, I have said 
everything. I'm one of those unfortunate duffers 
who have too much imagination —  the kind who 
build their own chimeras and then run away from 
them. How long shall I be kept in this bed? " 
"That's particularly up to you. Ten days should 





see you on your feet. But if you don't want to get 
up, maybe tliree times ten days ' 

There had never been, from that fatal hour eight 
months gone down to this, the inclination to confess. 
He had often read about it, and once he had incor- 
porated it in a story, that invisible force which sent 
men to prison and to the gallows, when a tongue 
controlled would have meant liberty indefinite. As 
for himself, there had never been a touch of it. It 
was less will than education. Even in his fevered 
hours, so the girl had said, his tongue had not be- 
trayed him. Perhaps that sealed letter was a form 
of confession, and thus relieved him on that score. 
And yet that could not be: it was a confession only 
in the event of his death. Living, he knew that he 
would never send that letter. 

His conscience, however, was entirely another 
affair. He could neither stifle nor deaden that. It 
was always jabbing him with white-hot barbs, wak- 
ing or sleeping. But it never said: "Tell someone! 
Tell someone!" Was he something of a moral 
pervert, then? Was it what he had lost — the fami- 
liar world —  rather than what he had done? 

He stared dully at the footraiL For the present the 
desire to fly was gone. No doubt that was due to his 
helplessness. When he was up and about, the idea 
of flight would return. But how far could he fly 
on a few hundred? True, he might find a job some- 
where; but every footstep from behind. . . ! 



 

''TVlio is she? Where does she come from? '' 

''You mean Miss Enschede?" 

'' Yes. That dress she has on —  my mother might 
have worn it." 

He was beginning to notice things, then? The 
doctor was pleased. The boy was coming around. 
  Miss Enschede was bom on an island in the South 
Seas. She is setting out for Hartford, Connecticut. 
The dress was her mother's, and she was wearing it 
to save a little extra money." 

The doctor had entered the room fully determined 
to tell the patient the major part of Ruth's story, 
to inspire him with proper respect and gratitude. 
Instead, he could not get beyond these minor details 
—  why she wore the dress, whence she had come, and 
whither she was bound. The idea of this sudden re- 
luctance was elusive; the fact was evident but not the 
reason for it. 

"How would you like a job on a copra plantation?" 
he asked, irrelevantly to the thoughts crowding one 
another in his mind. "Out of the beaten track, 
with a real man for an employer? How would that 
strike you?" 

Interest shot into Spurlock's eyes; it spread to his 
wan face. Out of the beaten track! He must not 
appear too eager. "I'll need a job when I quit this 
bed. I'm not particular what or where." 

 'That kind of talk makes you sound like a white 
man. Of course, I can't promise you the job 





definitely. But IVe an old friend on the way 
here, and he knows the game down there. If he 
hasn't a job for you» he'll know someone who has. 
Managers and accountants are always shifting about, 
so he tells me. It's mighty lonesome down there 
for a man bred to cities." 

"Find me the job. I don't care how lonesome 

it IS. 

Out of the beaten track! thought Spurlock. 
A forgotten island beyond the ship lanes, where 
that grim Hand would falter and move blindly 
in its search for him! From what he had read, 
there wouldn't be much to do; and in the idle hours 
be could write. 

"Thanks," he said, holding out a thin white hand. 
"I'll be very glad to take that kind of a job, if 
you can find it." 

"Well, that's fine. Got you interested in some- 
thing, then? Would you like a peg?" 

"No. I hated the stuff. There was a pleasant 
numbness in the bottle; that's why I went to it." 

" Thought so. But I had to know for sure. Down 
there, whisky raises the very devil with white men. 
Don't build your hopes too high; but I will do what 
I can. While there's life there's hope« Buck up." 

"I'm afraid I don't understand." 

"Understand what?" 

"You or this girl. There are, then, in this sorry 
world, people who can be disinterestedly kind!"
