Esmerald.

DR. THORNE. Most people don’t know when they are disagreeable. (He does
not offer to kiss her; pulls off his overcoat nervously.) Isn’t dinner
ready? I am starved out.

(MAGGIE is seen in the dining-room hastily serving dinner.)

MRS. THORNE (ringing). Maggie had orders to put it on as soon as she
heard your wheels.... Yes. There! You poor, hungry fellow!

       Enter MAGGIE.

MAGGIE. Dinner is served, Mrs. Thorne.

DR. THORNE. I must run up and change my coat, first--no, I won’t. I
haven’t time. I am driven to death. Come along, Helen. (Strides out
before her; then recalls himself from his discourtesy, and steps back.
DR. THORNE is a tall, well-built, handsome man, of distinguished
bearing, but with a slight limp; his face is disfigured by a frown, as
he looks at his wife. He repeats) I am driven to death! I haven’t time
to call my soul my own.

MRS. THORNE (archly). I thought you hadn’t any soul, dear. Or I
thought you thought you hadn’t.

DR. THORNE (crossly). Soul? Rubbish! It is more than I can do to
manage bodies. Soul? Stuff! What have you got for dinner?

(They seat themselves at the table.)

MRS. THORNE. You poor boy! You poor, tired, hungry fellow! I hope the
dinner will please you? (Timidly.)

DR. THORNE (testily). Really, I hadn’t time to come at all. I’ve got
to go again in ten minutes. But I supposed you would worry if I didn’t
show myself. It’s a foolish waste of time. I wish I hadn’t come.

MRS. THORNE (speaking in a low, controlled, articulate voice). You
need not. On my account. You need never come again.

DR. THORNE (irritably). It is easier to come than to know you sit here
making yourself miserable because I don’t.

MRS. THORNE (gently). Have I ever fretted you about coming, Esmerald?
I did not know it.

DR. THORNE. It would be easier if you did fret. I’d rather you’d say a
thing than look it. Any man would.... This soup is burned!

MRS. THORNE. Too bad! I gave special orders to Jane--that is really too
bad. Let me send it away.

DR. THORNE (excitedly). No, I’ve got to get down something. Bring on
the rest--if there is anything fit to eat. I’m due at the Hospital in
twenty-two minutes. Gazell is behaving like the devil. If I’m not to
handle him, nobody can. The whole staff is afraid of him--everybody but
me. We sha’n’t get the new ward built these two years if he carries the
day to-night. I’ve got a consultation at Decker’s. The old lady is
dying. It’s no use dragging a tired man out there; I can’t do her any
good. But they will have it. I’m at the beck and call of every whim. I
wish I’d had time to change my boots! My feet are wet. My head aches
horribly. I had an enormous office--sixty people; forty here--twenty
down-town--besides my calls. I’ve seen eighty sick people to-day. I was
a fool to agree to that noon office hour.--I’ve lost ten thousand
dollars in this panic. Brake telephoned me to get down to Stock Street
to save what I could. I couldn’t get off.... I lost a patient this
morning--that little girl at the Harrohart’s. She was a poor little
scrofulous thing, but they are terribly cut up about it.--I wish you’d
had a good, clear soup. I hate these opaque things.

MRS. THORNE. But last time we had consommé, you said--

DR. THORNE. I said! I said! Who cares what he says?

MRS. THORNE (in a low voice). That seems to be quite true.

DR. THORNE. What did you say? Do speak louder. I hate to hear women
mumble their words.--I hope you have some roast beef; better than the
last. You mustn’t let Parsnip cheat you. Quail? There’s no nourishment
in quail for a man in my state-- (Pushes away his plate crossly.)
Well, I suppose I’ve got to eat something. I was a fool not to dine at
the club.--The gas leaks. Can’t you have it attended to? Pudding? No. I
see enough of spoon food in sick rooms. I might have eaten a good,
hearty pie.

MRS. THORNE. But the last pie we had, you said--

DR. THORNE (again). I said! I said! What does it signify what a man
says? How many times must I say that? Hurry up the coffee. I must
swallow it, and go. I’ve got more than ten men could do.

MRS. THORNE (gently, but with perceptible dignity). It seems to be
more than one woman can do--

DR. THORNE. What’s that? Do speak so I can hear you.--If you’re going to
speak at all.

MRS. THORNE. I said it seems to be more than one woman can do to rest
you.

DR. THORNE (carelessly). Do ring for a decent cup of coffee. I can’t
drink this.

MRS. THORNE. Esmerald--

DR. THORNE (crossly). Oh, what? I can’t stop to talk. There! I’ve
burned my tongue now. If there’s anything I can’t stand, it’s going to a
consultation with a burned tongue.

MRS. THORNE (tenderly). How tired you are, Esmerald! It even gets into
your poor foot.--You limp more to-night. I was only going to say that I
am sorry. I can’t let you go without saying that.

DR. THORNE (rising, and walking irritably through the rooms). I can’t
see that that helps it any. I am so tired I don’t want to be touched.
(Mrs. Thorne brings his overcoat. He repulses her.) Never mind my
coat. I’ll put it on myself. Tell Joe--No. I left the horse standing; I
don’t want Joe. I suppose Donna is uneasy by this time. She won’t stand
at night--She’s got to. I’ll get that whim out of her.--Now don’t look
that way! The horse is safe enough.

MRS. THORNE. I haven’t bothered you about the horse, have I? But I don’t
feel--quite--easy. She is such a nervous creature, and so--

DR. THORNE (imperiously). Don’t you suppose I know how to drive?
You’re always having opinions of your own against mine. There! I must be
off.--Where’s the boy, Helen? Where’s Laddie?

MRS. THORNE (gently). Laddie isn’t just right, somehow, Esmerald. I
hated to bother you, for you never think it’s anything. Molly is with
him. I’ve been a little troubled about him. He has cried all the
afternoon.

DR. THORNE. He cries because you coddle him! It is all nonsense, Helen.
Nothing ails the child. I won’t encourage this sort of thing. I’ll see
him when I come home. I can’t possibly wait--I am driven to death--for
every little whim. (Rushes towards the door, but pauses, irresolute.)
I suppose I shall have to go up--if you’ve got this fixed idea in your
head. I’ll take a look at him on the way out.
