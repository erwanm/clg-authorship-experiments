men and through men, and that we must 
expect to find difficulties in it, and earnestly 
and pointedly asks, Where will you find, on 
the whole, a better book for the guidance of 
human weakness ? 

The unbeliever replies that there is much 
fine poetry in the Bible, but more bad argu- 
ment, Oriental superstition, and confused met- 
aphor ; that many men are inspired ; that 
Goethe was a divine man ; and that Brown- 
ing's Paracelsus is as much a work of inspi- 
ration as the Song of Solomon, and far more 
moral. He adds that it is impossible to recon- 
cile God's sovereignty with man's freedom in 
any such make-shift manner as that adopted 
by the theologians, and that God either cre- 
ated sin, or he did not ; that if he did he was 
not benevolent, and if he did not he was not 







omnipotent ; and that we are made to cultivate 
our manhood, express our individuality, and 
study the secrets of nature. 

The believer suggests that it may be possi- 
ble we do not, as finite beings, understand all 
the mysteries in the nature of an infinite God ; 
that it is not to be wondered at if we must 
leave some points unexplained ; that this is 
perhaps a part of the discipline necessary to fit 
us for the eternal life. 

The unbeliever hastens to say that of the 
eternal life we know absolutely nothing, — we 
cannot conceive of either beginning or end ; 
that we are here and know it, but further than 
this we have no right to infer. We may cher- 
ish immortality only as a " solemn hope " (the 
believer's eyes fill, and he mentally ejaculates, 
" Poor fellow ! or we may expect to be as 
the beasts that perish, and live on in the forces 
of nature, and the resurrection of the seasons, 
and the memories of unborn generations, and 
so on, but that geology is making every hour 
discoveries which are to revolutionize belief; 
that hope, faith, love, and the. energies of im- 
agination are beautiful fancies, but rocks are 
facts, and therefore (as nearly as the believer 




can understand) he urges that we cling to the 
rocks. 

The believer suggests that rocks are cold 
comfort ; to the bereaved, for instance, or the 
remorseful. 

The unbeliever replies, vaguely, that he is 
not sure, either, that we comprehend the differ- 
ence between infinite or finite — Finite ? In- 
finite ? He is not certain that there is any in- 
finite, or that he himself, in short, is finite — 
but that science — And so on, and so on. 

Now, all this is firing wild. There is no 
gold in the target. There shows no target in 
the mist. If we set our aim in a fog-bank, 
who is to decide whether we have hit ? 

The believer may seek to " save " the unbe- 
liever in this fashion till " the eve of the day 
of the Last Awaking," — he will only irritate. 
The doubting may try to "reason" with the 
trusting on this wise, till his tongue returns to 
the dust that he claims his kin to, — he can 
only depress. The disputants have swerved 
from the most elementary of the principles of 
logic. They have discovered no major premise 
in common. They must agree upon something 
before they can disagree intelligently about 







anything. There can be no dispute without a 
basis of harmony. " We may never, perhaps," 
as Hamilton says, " arrive at truth, but we 
can always avoid self-contradiction." 

Let us now suppose, as it is the object of 
this paper to suggest, that these two equally 
earnest people ask of each other, at the outset 
of all sincere and serious discussion, one sim- 
ple question : What is a Fact f 

The believer, we will assume, happens to put 
the query. The unbeliever hesitates. Neither 
of the disputants are psychological scholars. 
Both are intelligently educated. The unbe- 
liever is the more accustomed of the two, 
probably, to sophistries of discussion. He 
perceives the importance of the point, and 
hesitates. It is one of the maxims of civil 
law that definitions are hazardous. After a 
thoughtful pause, he replies, with the blunt 
courage of common sense, which is quite as apt 
to hit the truth as the sharply refined point of 
the artist in philosophical language, that he 
should say a fact was a thing that could be 
verified. 

To this the believer, without hesitation, 
agrees. All he claims, he adds, is that religion 







is a matter of fact as well as science. Grant 
this, he urges, and we can pursue our discus- 
sion. Deny it, and the sooner we agree to dis- 
agree the better. The believers own vision 
has begun to clarify, with this closer exactness 
of definition, and his method of expression in- 
tensifies. 

The unbeliever replies, with animation, that
