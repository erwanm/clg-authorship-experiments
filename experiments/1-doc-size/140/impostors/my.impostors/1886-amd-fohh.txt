" But we walked a great deal yesterday," returns Doris, 
excusingly. "And you know we lived over again Juliet's 
sorrows and Romeo's anguish." 

" After all, it is only a story, a play," says Mrs. Gil- 
bert, studying the faces of both. 

" Oh ! " returns Doris, " we hunted up all the places, 
only we didn't go to Mantua. And if they were not 
quite right, our interest made them so." 

" We will not take the next play as hard. That will be 
Shylock." 

'' I have heard them very effectively rendered," says 
Mrs. Gilbert. Then she goes on with a vivid description 
of the various stars she has seen in the leading parts, 
some of them dead now. Wentworth listens with a good 
deal of interest. 

Meanwhile two or three thoughts are being settled in 
his mind. One is, that Mrs. Gilbert is a capital friend for 
young people, though she does not reach the immaculate 
standard of his own aunt. There is a certain free-and- 
easiness among Americans abroad that is charming when 
it does not degenerate into loudness. She has this in an 
eminent degree. And he cannot help thinking now that 
some women — and are not all women credited with a fond- 
ness for match-making? — would have tried a little in the 
time they have been together. But after all, she may not 
think him worth angling for. 

He dismisses the subject, and resolves to enjoy the 
delights of the time and place. The conversation branches 



 



 



 

out into various discussions, and ends with where they shall 
go next, and how. Mantua, of course ; then Padua and 
Venice. There is no hurry. Let them take it leisurely. 

Sometimes this very ease half angers Mrs. Gilbert. It 
is money, and money only. Every day she becomes more 
conscious of the fact that the Wentworth fortune is large, 
and that the young man is so used to it, a few hundred 
dollars more or less is nothing. She has hung over him 
at night in anxiety, and literally fanned the breath of life 
back into his body ; she has done her earnest utmost to 
keep him alive ; and yet she coolly looks forward to the 
money, and the position his widow will have. Common 
gratitude will lead Doris to offer her a home, and a haven 
of refuge looks so inviting now. She is forty-five, and her 
sole worldly possessions are a dozen diamonds all told, 
none of any immense value, some elegant laces, great bar- 
gains, and a few choice gowns and wraps ; but the latter 
do grow passe J and it is not a comfortable thing to be 
recognized by your half-a-dozen-year-old dresses. As for 
Mr. Gilbert, the future will be the same as the past. 
So she must build her own nest, and if she can feather 
it with down, so much the better. 

They stay at home and talk and read all the afternoon, 
at least the young people do. It is books and dead-and- 
gone people. Wentworth dresses up his school-day 
heroes, his Latin and Greek poets, his philosophers and 
sculptors, tells her where they lived and what they did. 
She has learned a little about some of them ; she listens, 
eager and wide-eyed. There is so much in the great 
world, and she knows only such a very small part of it, 
that she is quite ashamed . 

After a rest of a day or two, they go on to Padua, where 
antiquity flavors everything. The odd dresses, the bare- 
footed children, the priests and mendicants are still in 
force. Here are the old universities. They laugh again 
at the learned young doctor from Padua. 



 



 



 

They go to the little theatre, which is shabhy in the 
extreme, and the shams of the properties are everywhere 
visible. The play is " Pyramus and Thisbe," and it is acted 
with such wonderful sweetness and reality, that Doris sits 
enchanted, though Mrs. Gilbert votes it a bore, and not 
worth going to see. 

And now they reach the Queen of the Adriatic, fair 
Venice. Doris would recognize it at once by Wentworth's 
description if she had not read at all. The sun is shining 
on the magnificent palaces, the innumerable bridges, the 
spires, the arches ; and the sky and sea seem one glitter- 
ing, throbbing world of mysterious fire, that looks as if 
it could never burn out. 

After some slight difficulty they get domiciled, as has 
happened before, in an old palace. Martin is invaluable, 
and finds a housekeeper, a pleasant-faced woman, with 
cheeks like a brown-red winter apple, and bright dark 
eyes. Their rooms are old, and have a sad, weird look of 
desertion, but the sun shines goldenly in them, and in this 
glorious weather they can well take a little discomfort. 

Indeed, the drawbacks are nothing compared to the 
delights, the bewildering succession of surprises. They 
do not fiud it all canals, but there are streets, narrow, 
crooked, broken by courts that beguile them into dim 
recesses and carven ruins, that even now seem priceless. 
Or, up some flight of marble steps, they find a pillared 
gallery where sculptor's dream has been wrought into 
marble, and is now left to sad and lonely decay. 

Or there are the public gardens and the piazza, with 
the Austrian band playing, and many strangers promenad- 
ing in the summer sunset. 

After, in the golden twilight, the Venetians take their 
turn, — grave, sombre, haughty, but happy among them- 
selves, floating in their open gondolas, and the shadowy, 
veiled women flitting in and out with attendant servant, as 
if shrouded in supremest mystery. Everything seems to
