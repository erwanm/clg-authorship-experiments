would not permit a single one of them to go 
below, 

" That's not the way to do on board ship," 
said he. " Are you all going below at once ? " 

"Why not?" asked Tom Nettle. 

" Suppose we should have occasion to tack, or 
to take in sail in a hurry ? Have we got to wait 
for you to finish your plate of chowder ? " 

"We are all as hungry as bears, Captain Gor- 
don," added Frank Thompson. " We can't stand 
it any longer." 

" Part of you must stand it half an hour 
longer. Captain Briskctt has the helm, and the 
larboard watch will remain on deck, the starboard 
watch go below." 

The captain's watch tumbled down the com- 
panion way, ranged themselves round the table, 
and went to work as though they had not eaten 
any thing for a month. As they are doing very 
well, we will return to the deck, and listen a 
few moments to the remarks of the mate's watch. 

Paul had seated himself by the side of the 



 

helmsman, and was asking questions in regard to 
the reef, the depth of water in the harbor, and 
other questions of interest only to nautical per- 
sons. The rest of the watch had gathered in a 
group on the forecastle. It was unfortunate that 
so many of the refractory spirits had been chosen 
into the same watch; but there were Tom Nettle, 
Frank Thompson, and Samuel Nason, all three of 
whom had once been expelled from the club for 
misconduct, and only been readmitted on their 
solemn promise to mend their manners, and be- 
have like gentlemen in future. 

'' I don't like it," said Tom ; " and if the rest of 
the fellows will back me up, I will go below and 
have dinner with the crowd." 

" I will back you up, for one," said Frank. 

" And I, for another," added Samuel. 

'' But Captain Gordon gave a good reason why 
some of us should remain on deck," suggested 
one of the boys. 

"No, he didn't. What is there to do? We 
shan't have to touch a sail this hour — see if we 
do," retorted Tom. 



 

" But we might hsxxe occasion to do so, and 
for one, I am willing to observe the discipline of 
the vessel," said Charles Lawrence. 

'' I don't like the idea of having old Gordon 
domineering over us for a week," added Frank. 
" I don't care so much about the dinner as I do 
the spirit the old fellow exhibited. He placed 
himself before the companion way, just as though 
he had been the captain of a ship, and we were 
all common sailors." 

" We will cure him of that before we have 
been with him many days," added Tom. 

" I'll bet we will," answered Frank ; " and I 
think the present is the best time to begin. How 
many of you will make a grand rush into the 
cabin?" 

There were only four of them who were willing 
to take this rash step. 

" Come on, then," said Tom, " I will go if 
there is only one fellow to back me up." 

"We will follow you," added Frank. "Go 
ahead, Tom!" 



 

"You had better count the cost before you 
go any farther," interposed Charles Lawrence. 
" You know we all promised to obey Captain 
Gordon in every thing he directed, whether on 
shore or on board." 

" We didn't expect he was going to treat us 
like servants — like dogs." 

" Captain Littleton wouldn't let him domineer 
over us in that style if he were here. Come on, 
boys," said Tom, as he led the way aft. 

" Where are you going, boys ? " demanded Cap- 
tain Briskett, as the rebellious watch appeared in 
the standing room. 

" Going below to get our dinner." 

" Not yet ; you must wait till the watch is 
relieved. You heard the captain's orders." 

" We don't care for the captain's orders. We 
are not going to be treated like dogs." 

" But it is necessary that one watch should be 
on deck all the time." 

" Can you tell me why it was necessary to have 
the starboard watch go to dinner first ? " 



 

'' I cannot ; it is the captain's business to or-
