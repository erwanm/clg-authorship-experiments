meaning the unseen lady in the alcove.

"She'll be a good while longer getting through with him, if he
hasn't them ready the next time," the second lady said.

But the lady in the alcove issued from it with an impredicable smile,
and the tailor came up to the others, and deferred to their wishes
with a sort of voiceless respect.

He gave the customer a glance of good-fellowship, and said to him,
radiantly: "Your things all ready for you, this morning. As soon as
I--"

"Oh, no hurry," the customer responded.

"I won't be a minute," the tailor said, pulling the curtain of the
alcove aside, and then there began those sounds of objurgation and
expostulation, although the ladies had seemed so amiable before.

The customer wondered if they did not all enjoy it; the ladies in
their patience under long trial, and the tailor in the pleasure of
practising upon it. But perhaps he did believe in the things he
promised. He might be so much a genius as to have no grasp of facts;
he might have thought that he could actually do what he said.

The customer's question on these points found answer when one day the
tailor remarked, as it were out of a clear sky, that he had sold his
business; sold it to the slippered journeyman who used to come in his
shirt-sleeves, with his vest-front full of pins and needles, bringing
the basted garments to be tried on the ladies who had been promised
them perfectly finished.

"He will do your clothes all right," he explained to the customer. "He
is a first-rate cutter and fitter; he knows the whole business."

"But why--why--" the customer began.

"I couldn't stand it. The way them ladies would talk to a person, when
you done your best to please them; it's something fierce."

"Yes, I know. But I thought you liked it, from the way you always
promised them and never kept your word."

"And if I hadn't promised them?" the tailor returned with some show of
feeling. "They wanted me to promise them--they made me--they
wouldn't have gone away without it. Sure. Every one wanted her things
before every one. You had got to think of that."

"But you had to think of what they would say."

"Say? Sometimes I thought they would hit me. One lady said she had a
notion to slap me once. It's no way to talk."

"But you didn't seem to mind it."

"I didn't mind it for a good while. Then I couldn't stand it. So I
sold."

He shook his head sadly; but the customer had no comfort to offer him.
He asked when his clothes would be done, and the tailor told him when,
and then they were not. The new proprietor tried them on, but he would
not say just when they would be finished.

"We have a good deal of work already for some ladies that been
disappointed. Now we try a new way. We tell people exactly what we
do."

"Well, that's right," the customer said, but in his heart he was not
sure he liked the new way.

The day before his clothes were promised he dropped in. From the
curtained alcove he heard low murmurs, the voice of the new proprietor
and the voice of some lady trying on, and being severely bidden not to
expect her things at a time she suggested. "No, madam. We got too much
work on hand already. These things, they will not be done before next
week."

"I told you to-morrow," the same voice said to another lady, and the
new proprietor came out with an unfinished coat in his hand.

"I know you did, but I thought you would be better than your word, and
so I came to-day. Well, then, to-morrow."

"Yes, to-morrow," the new proprietor said, but he did not seem to have
liked the lady's joke. He did not look happy.

A few weeks after that the customer came for some little alterations
in his new suit.

In the curtained alcove he heard the murmurs of trying on, much
cheerfuller murmurs than before; the voice of a lady lifted in
gladness, in gaiety, and an incredible voice replying, "Oh, sure,
madam."

Then the old proprietor came out in his shirt-sleeves and slippers,
with his waistcoat-front full of pins and needles, just like the new
proprietor in former days.

"Why!" the customer exclaimed. "Have you bought back?"

"No. I'm just here like a journeyman already. The new man he want me
to come. He don't get along very well with his way. He's all right;
he's a good man and a first-class tailor. But," and the former
proprietor looked down at the basted garment hanging over his arm, and
picked off an irrelevant thread from it, "he thinks I get along better
with the ladies."

                          SOMEBODY'S MOTHER


The figure of a woman sat crouched forward on one of the lowermost
steps of the brownstone dwelling which was keeping a domestic
tradition in a street mostly gone to shops and small restaurants and
local express-offices. The house was black behind its closed shutters,
and the woman remained sitting there because no one could have come
out of its door for a year past to hunt her away. The neighborhood
policeman faltered in going by, and then he kept on. The three people
who came out of the large, old-fashioned hotel, half a block off, on
their way for dinner to a French table d'hôte which they had heard
of, stopped and looked at the woman. They were a father and his son
and daughter, and it was something like a family instinct that
controlled them, in their pause before the woman crouching on the
steps.

It was the early dusk of a December day, and the day was very chilly.
"She seems to be sick or something," the father vaguely surmised. "Or
asleep."

The three looked at the woman, but they did nothing for a moment. They
would rather have gone on, but they waited to see if anything would
happen to release them from the spell that they seemed to have laid
upon themselves. They were conditional New-Yorkers of long sojourn,
and it was from no apparent motive that the son wore evening dress,
which his unbuttoned overcoat discovered, and an opera-hat. He would
not have dressed so for that problematical French table d'hôte;
