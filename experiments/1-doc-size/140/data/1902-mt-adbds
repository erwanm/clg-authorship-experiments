seem to make out thxit clew. So he — '' 
"See him smile! — like a tiger — 
and tally off the other fingers like 
nothing! He's got it, boys; he's 
got it sure!" 
"Well, I should say! Td hate to 
be in that man's place that he's after." 
Mr. Holmes drew a table to the 
window, sat down with his back to 
the spies, and proceeded to write. 
The spies withdrew their eyes from 
the peep-holes, Ht their pipes, and 
settled themselves for a comfortable 
smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with 
conviction : 
"Boys, it's no use talking, he's 
a wonder! He's got the signs of it 
all over him." 
''You hain't ever said a truer 
word than that, Wells-Fargo' said 
Jake Parker. "Say, wouldn't it 'a' 
been nuts if he'd a -been here last 
night?" 
"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" 
said Ferguson. "Then we'd have Sden- 
seen scientific work. Intellect — just
pure intellect — away up on the upper '" 
levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all 
right, and it don't become anybody 
to belittle him, I can tell you. But 
his gift is only just eyesight, sharp 
as an owl's, as near as I can make it 
out just a grand natural animal tal- 
ent, no more, no less, and prime as 
far as it goes, but no intellect in it, 
and for awfulness and marvellousness 
no more to be compared to what 
this man does than — than — Why, 
let me tell you what he'd have done. 
He'd have stepped over to Hogan's 
and glanced — just glanced, that's all 
— at the premises, and that's enough. 
See everything? Yes, sir, to the 
last little cfetail; and he'd know more 
about that place than the Hogans 
would know in seven years. Next, 
method   
he would sit down on the bunk, just 
as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan — 
Say, Ham, consider that you are 
Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; 
you answer them." 
"All right; goon." 
"Madam, if you please — attention 
— do not let your mind wander. Now, 
then — sex of the child?" 
"Female, your Honor." 
" Um — female. Very good, very 
good. Age?- . 
"Turned six, your Honor." " 
" Um — yoimg, weak — two miles. 
Weariness will overtake it then. It 
will sink down and sleep. We shall 
find it two miles away, or less. 
Teeth?" 
" Five, your Honor, and one a-coming." 
"Very good, very good, very good 
indeed. You see, boys, he knows a 
clew when he sees it, when it wouldn't 
mean a dem thing to anybody else. 
Stockings, madam? Shoes?'' 
"Yes, your Honor — both." 
"Yam, perhaps? Morocco?" 
"Yam, your Honor. And kip." 
"Um — kip. This complicates the 
matter. However, let it go — we shall 
manage. Religion?'' 
And 
then I '' Catholic, your Honor. '' 
"Very good. Snip me a bit from 
the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. 
Part wool — foreign make. Very well. 
A snip from some garment of the 
child's, please. Thanks. Cotton. 
Shows wear. An excellent clew, 
excellent. Pass me a pellet of the 
floor dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, 
many thanks. Ah, admirable, ad- 
mirable! Now we know where we 
are, I think. You see, boys, he's 
got all the clews he wants now; he 
don't need anything more. Now, 
then, what does this Extraordinary 
Man do? He lays those snips and 
that dirt out on the table and leans 
over them on his elbows, and puts 
them together side by side and 
studies them — mumbles to himself, 
'Female'; changes them around — 
mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes 
them this way and that — again mum- 
bles : ' Five teeth — one a-coming — 
Catholic — yarn — cotton — kip — thinking 
damn that kip Then he straight- 
ens up and gazes toward heaven, 
and ploughs his hands through his 
hair — ploughs and ploughs, mutter- 
ing, ' Damn that kip ! ' Then he stands 
up and frowns, and begins to tally 
off his clews on his fingers — and gets 
stuck at the ring-finger. But only 
just a minute — then his face glares 
all up in a smile like a house afire, 
and he straightens up stately and 
majestic, and says to the crowd, ' Take 
a lantern, a couple of you, and go 
down to Injun Billy's and fetch the 
child — the rest of you go 'long home 
to bed; good-night, madam; good- 
night, gents And he bows like the 
Matterhorn, and pulls out for the 
Edsy style tavern. That's his style, 
and the only — scientific, intellectual — 
all over in fifteen minutes — no poking around 
all over the sage-brush range an hour 
and a half in a mass-meeting crowd 
for him, boys — you hear me !" 
''By Jackson, it's grand!" said 
Ham Sandwich. '' Wells-Fargo, you've 
got him down to a dot. He ain't 
painted up any exacter to the life in 
the books. By George, I can just see 
him -can't you, boys?" 
''You bet you! It's just a photo-made  graft, 
that's what it is." 
Ferguson was profoundly pleased 
with his success, and grateful. He 
sat silently enjoying his happiness a 
little while, then he murmured, with 
a deep awe in his voice.
