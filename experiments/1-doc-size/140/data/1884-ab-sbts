'' But there would be so many things to consider. 
Encouragement means a great deal to Philip ; perhaps 
it means more than you intend it should, and I can't 
bear to have him disappointed." 

Oswald was always charmed with the intentness of 
her manner. Just now, he told himself she was a suf- 
ficiently unusual woman to be a very fascinating one, 
and it was due to this fascination that he said in earnest 



 

what half an hour ago he would have pronounced 
wildly erratic. 

" I don't see why he need underestimate my words. 
Why shouldn't I even educate him if I choose, for his 
sake and yours ? ' 

Elizabeth had been looking at him quietly ; his eyes 
still held hers for a moment. Then surprise hurried 
in and frightened away all other expression, before her 
glance fell and she turned away. Some one came in 
at the moment, and so the conversation was dropped 
without awkwardness. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

THERE were no fancies in Elizabeth's mind relative 
to falling in love with Oswald, but he had gained a 
power of making her uneasily happy. She had felt, from 
the first, the charm of his personal grace and quickness 
of thought, but since his looks and tones had acquired 
a meaning for her alone since, by a thousand signs 
imperceptible to an observer and tantalizingly incapa- 
ble of analysis, he had made her sure that neither sea 
nor sky was the center of his interest in Stratford, 
she was only conscious of a trembling desire to escape. 
There is nothing very unusual in that. Many a woman 
closes the doors of her reserve and retreats to the in- 
nermost recess of her castle, just before showing the 
white flag in a half reluctant grasp, and yielding uncon- 
ditionally. 

Perhaps there is a merciful provision in this trem- 
bling advance of the spring. If love should grasp a 
heart so that it could not flutter, I question whether 
the poor thing would ever beat afterwards. 

There was for Oswald a peculiar pleasure in stirring 
the consciousness of one so fine, so entirely inexperi- 
enced, and in spite of that, so self-contained as Eliza- 
beth. She had not been through half a dozen flirta- 
tions, which leave girls with no deeper knowledge of 
the world nor larger field of vision than she, keen ob- 



 

servers of the emotions, sage in noting effects and 
prophesying results. She never doubted sincerity, 
having no occasion forgoing so, and would have said 
that an unswerving line separated honest men from 
liars, as if a moral leprosy must inevitably be visible 
on the surface. Sometimes she wished, with an exhi- 
bition of pettishness quite new to her, that Oswald 
would go away, and on seeing him half an hour after, 
blushed at herself for having been either childish or a 
prude. And running through all, like a silver thread, 
the spring brightened her reveries in spite of their 
waywardness. 

One morning Oswald brought her a letter in Grand- 
mother's cramped handwriting. Elizabeth had been 
carrying potted geraniums out of doors to accustom 
them to the strong sunshine and fresh winds, before 
they should take up their summer residence in the gar- 
den. She held the letter an instant without speaking, 
put it in the pocket of her gingham apron and then, 
with an access of resolution, took it out and broke the 
seal. A sigh of relief accompanied the reading of the 
first half page. 

" Shall I tell you why you hesitated in opening that ? " 
asked Oswald, laughing saucily. 

The air from the sea had awakened in him an abund- 
ant vitality ; how could he work it off better than by 
amusing himself with the first person at hand ? 

"Yes, if you can," said Elizabeth, trying properly 
to be serious, but yielding to the mischievous sugges- 
tion of his eyes. 

" The postmark is Stowe. I found that out on the 
way home, having nothing else to do till I reached the 



 

point where you get a glimpse of the sea. Madam 
Nye is there. Your fear to read the letter said, 'I'm 
afraid she's coming home.' Your sigh of relief, ' She 
isn't coming, and I'm glad.' Am I a seer, or not ? " 

'How long have you been a detective ? " said Eliz- 
abeth. ' If you are so very wise, you might have saved 
me from opening my letter at all." 

'Right, then ? I knew I was! Mrs. Nye," as she 
appeared in the midst of a flock of hungry chickens, 
some, more clamorous than the rest, flying up to her 
shoulder, and one gaunt creature with long legs perch- 
ing on the dish of dough, " I am glad to inform you 
that the crisis is past." 

Mrs. Nye looked up inquiringly, ceasing for the 
moment to repel her feathered assailants, and thereby 
giving them an advantage. 

'A letter from Stowe states that Madam Nye will 
not return for how long, Miss Elizabeth ? " 

' Not for a month or six weeks," answered Elizabeth, 
smiling at her mother, in whose face an answering 
gladness at once appeared. 

' But I think Mr. Craig ought to be scolded. Fie 
pilfered the news from my face, or my mind it doesn't 
make much difference which." 

Oswald looked from one to the other with a face of 
such innocent vacuity that the two broke into a laugh,
