disturbed; and after all there was something about these two women that
he liked--in different ways. The English girl was so solidly
enthusiastic, and the Scotch gentlewoman so severely courageous, that he
felt a sort of companionable sympathy after he had been with them a few
minutes.

Lady Victoria, as previously hinted, was married, and her husband, who
was in the diplomatic service, and who had prospects afterwards of
coming into money and a peerage, was now absent on a distant mission.
They had not been married very long, but his wife was always ready to
take things cheerfully, and, since she could not accompany him, she had
made up her mind to be happy without him; and the trip with her brother
was "just the very thing." Mr. Barker admired what he called her
exuberant vitality, and expressed his opinion that people with a
digestion like that were always having a good time. She was strong and
healthy, and destined to be the mother of many bold sons, and she had a
certain beauty born of a good complexion, bright eyes, and white teeth.
To look at her, you would have said she must be the daughter of some
robust and hardworking settler, accustomed from her youth to face rain
and snow and sunshine in ready reliance on her inborn strength. She did
not suggest dukes and duchesses in the least. Alas! the generation of
those ruddy English boys and girls is growing rarer day by day, and a
mealy-faced, over-cerebrated people are springing up, who with their
children again, in trying to rival the brain-work of foreigners with
larger skulls and more in them, forget that their English forefathers
have always done everything by sheer strength and bloodshed, and can as
easily hope to accomplish anything by skill as a whale can expect to
dance upon the tight rope. They would do better, thought Lady Victoria,
to give it up, to abandon the struggle for intellectual superiority of
that kind. They have produced greater minds when, the mass of their
countrymen were steeped in brutality, and Elizabethan surfeit of beef
and ale, than they will ever produce with a twopenny-halfpenny universal
education. What is the use? Progress. What is progress? Merely the
adequate arrangement of inequalities--in the words of one of their own
thinkers who knows most about it and troubles himself least about
theories. What is the use of your "universal" education, to which
nine-tenths of the population submit as to a hopeless evil, which takes
bread out of their mouths and puts bran into their heads; for might they
not be at work in the fields instead of scratching pothooks on a slate?
At least so Lady Victoria thought.

"You look just like a sailor," said she to Claudius.

"I feel like one," he answered, "and I think I shall adopt the sea as a
profession."

"It is such a pity," said Miss Skeat, sternly clutching the twisted wire
shroud. "I would like to see you turn pirate; it would be so
picturesque--you and Mr. Barker." The others laughed, not at the idea of
Claudius sporting the black flag--for he looked gloomy enough to do
murder in the first degree this morning--but the picture of the
exquisite and comfort-loving Mr. Barker, with his patent-leather shoes
and his elaborate travelling apparatus, leading a band of black-browed
ruffians to desperate deeds of daring and blood, was novel enough to be
exhilarating; and they laughed loudly. They did not understand Mr.
Barker; but perhaps Miss Skeat, who liked him with an old-maidenly
liking, had some instinct notion that the gentle American could be
dangerous.

"Mr. Barker would never do for a pirate," laughed Lady Victoria; "he
would be always getting his feet wet and having attacks of neuralgia."

"Take care, Vick," said her brother, "he might hear you."

"Well, if he did? I only said he would get his feet wet. There is no
harm in that, and it is clear he has neuralgia, because he says it
himself."

"Well, of course," said the Duke, "if that is what you mean. But he will
wet his feet fast enough when there is any good reason."

"If you make it 'worth his while,' of course," said Lady Victoria, "I
have no doubt of it." She turned up her nose, for she was not very fond
of Mr. Barker, and she thought poorly of the Duke's financial
enterprises in America. It was not a bit like a good old English
gentleman to be always buying and selling mines and stocks and all sorts
of things with queer names.

"Look here, Vick, we won't talk any more about Barker, if you please."

"Very well, then you can talk about the weather," said she.

"Yes," said Claudius, "you may well do that. There is a good deal of
weather to talk about."

"Oh, I like a storm at sea, of all things!" exclaimed Lady Victoria,
forgetting all about Mr. Barker in the delicious sense of saltness and
freedom one feels on the deck of a good ship running through a lively
sea. She put out her face to catch the fine salt spray on her cheek.
Just then a little water broke over the side abaft the gangway, and the
vessel rose and fell to the sweep of a big wave. The water ran along
over the flush deck, as if hunting for the scuppers, and came swashing
down to the lee where the party were standing, wetting the ladies' feet
to the ankle. The men merely pulled themselves up by the ropes they
held, and hung till the deck was clear again.

"I don't suppose it hurts you to get wet," said the Duke to his sister,
"but you would be much better under hatches while this sort of thing is
going on."

"I think, if you will help me, I will go down and see how the Countess
is," said Miss Skeat; and Claudius detached her from the rigging and got
her down the companion, but the Duke stayed with his sister, who begged
for a few minutes more. Once below, Claudius felt how near he was to
Margaret, who was doubtless in the ladies' cabin. He could reach his own
quarters without entering that sanctum, of course, but as he still held
Miss Skeat's arm to steady her to the door, he could not resist the
temptation of putting his head through, for he knew now that she must be
there. It was a large sitting-room, extending through the whole beam,
with big port-holes on each side. Miss Skeat entered, and Claudius
looked in.

There was Margaret, looking much as usual, her face turned a little from
him as she lay in a huge arm-chair. She could not see him as she was,
and his heart beat furiously as he looked at the face he loved best of
all others.

Margaret spoke to Miss Skeat without turning her head, for she was
working at some of her eternal needlework.

"Have you had a good time? How did you get down?"

"Such an airing," answered the lady-companion, who was divesting herself
of her wraps, "and Dr Claudius--"

The last was lost to the Doctor's ear, for he withdrew his head and beat
a hasty retreat. Miss Skeat also stopped speaking suddenly, for as she
mentioned his name she looked naturally towards the door, supposing him
to be standing there, and she just saw his head disappear from between
the curtains. Margaret turned her eyes and saw Miss Skeat's
astonishment.

"Well, what about Dr. Claudius?" she asked.

"Oh, nothing," said Miss Skeat, "you asked me how I got down, and I was
going to say Dr. Claudius gave me his arm, and I thought he had come in
here with me."

Neither Miss Skeat nor Claudius had noticed Mr. Barker, who was
ensconced on a corner transom, with his nails and a book to amuse
