" We were going to do suck nice things ! 
Mrs. Laval gave me money for them, and 
Norton, he has money always ; and we were 
going to have Mrs. Eldridge's house cleaned, 
and get a bedstead, and towels, and a table, 
and ever so many things for her, to make her 
comfortable ; and I thought it would be so 
pleasant to get the things and take them to 
her. And aunt Candy says I am not to go 
again." 

"Did you tell your aunt what you were 
going to do?" 

"O no, sir; she thinks I have no business 
with such things ; and she does not like any 
body to go into very poor houses." 

" Then you did not ask her leave ? " 

" It never is any use to ask her anything. 




She won't let me go out to church now, 
except in the morning, and then sometimes 
she makes me go with her." 

Mr. Richmond was silent for some time. 
Matilda grew quiet, and they both were still. 

" And the worst of it all is," resumed 
Matilda, at last, "that it makes me hate her." 

" I do not like to hear you say that." 

" No, Mr. Richmond," said Matilda very 
sorrowfully. 

" Do you think it is right? " 

No, sir." 

" Do you think you cannot help doing 
what is wrong." 

" I don't think I can like aunt Candy." 

" We will pass that. But between not 
liking and hating, there is a wide distance. 
Are you obliged to hate her ? " 

Matilda did not answer. 

" Do you think anybody can be a child of 
God and have hatred in his heart ? " 

" How can I help it, Mr. Richmond ? " 
said Matilda piteously. 



 

" How can you help anything ? The best 
way is to be so full of love to Jesus that 
you love everybody for his sake." 

" But people that are not good " said 
Matilda. 

" It is easy to love people that are good. 
The wonder of the love of the Lord Jesus is, 
that it comes to people who are not good. 
And his children are like him. ' Be ye followers of God,' he tells them, ' as dear children ; 
and walk in love.' " 

" I am not like that, Mr. Richmond," Ma 
tilda said sadly. 

" Didn't you love little Lena Dow ? I am 
sure he is not very good." 

" But he never troubled me, much," said 
Matilda. " He does not make me miserable 
all the day long." 

Mr. Richmond paused again. 

" Our Master knew what it was to be ill 
treated by bad people, Matilda." 

Yes, Mr. Richmond." 

" How did he feel towards them ?" 

 

" O but I am not like that," said Matilda 
again. 

" You must be, if you are his child." 

" Must I ? " said Matilda, the tears dropping from her eyes quietly. "How can I? 
If you only knew, Mr. Richmond ! " 

" No matter ; the Lord knows. Tell him 
all about it ; and pray to be made so like 
him and to love him so well, that you may 
love even this unkind friend." 

" I don't think she is my friend," said Matilda ; " but it don't make any difference." 

" No, it does not make any difference." 

" Mr. Richmond," said Matilda timidly 
after a moment, " won't you pray with me ? " 

Which the minister instantly did. Matilda 
wept quietly all the time of his prayer and 
after they rose from their knees, leaning her 
head on Mr. Richmond's shoulder where she 
had poured out her troubles once before. 
Her friend let her alone, keeping his arm 
round her kindly, till the child raised her head 
and wiped her eyes. 



 

" Do you feel better ? " he whispered then. 
Matilda answered "yes," in an answering 
whisper. 

" But Mr. Richmond," she said presently, 
" I am very sorry for Lilac lane." 

" I am very sorry," he said.
