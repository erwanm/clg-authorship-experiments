“You will write the address, then, if you please!” was Mabel’s reply,
showing him the surface intended for it.

Then she left him.

“A sensible girl, after all! a genuine Aylett, in will and stoicism!”
 commented the master of the situation, beginning in his round, legible
characters, the inscription he hoped never to trace again. “So endeth
her first lesson in Cupid’s manual!”

He never knew that Mrs. Sutton had bolstered the Aylett will and
stoicism into stanchness at this closing scene. In a fit of despondency,
she had that morning imparted to Mabel the fact that she had written to
Frederic, ten days before, and had no answer, although she had besought
an immediate one.

“I have expected him confidently every day for a week,” she lamented. “I
didn’t suppose he would stay at Ridgeley, after what has happened;
but there’s the hotel in the village, and, as I told him, he could
accomplish more by an hour’s talk with you than by fifty letters. It is
very mysterious--his continued silence! He always appeared so frank and
reasonable. Nothing else like it has ever occurred in my experience--and
I have had a great deal, my dear!”

“I am sorry you wrote, aunt,” replied Mabel, sorrowfully dignified.
“Sorry you have subjected yourself to unnecessary mortification. I am
past feeling it for myself. We cannot longer doubt that Mr. Chilton
desires to hold no further communication with any of us.”

Within the hour she made up the pacquet and carried it to her brother.




CHAPTER VII. -- WASSAIL.


ALMOST sixteen months had passed since the dewless September morning,
when Mabel had gathered roses in the garden walks, and her brother’s
return had shaken the dew with the bloom from her young heart. It was
the evening of Christmas-day, and the tide of wassail, the blaze
of yule, were high at Ridgeley. Without, the fall of snow that had
commenced at sundown, was waxing heavier and the wind fiercer. In-doors,
fires roared and crackled upon every hearth; there was a stir of busy
or merry life in every room. About the spacious fire-place in the
“baronial” hall was a wide semicircle of young people, and before that
in the parlor, a cluster of elders, whose graver talk was enlivened,
from time to time, by the peals of laughter that tossed into jubilant
surf the stream of the juniors’ converse.

Nearest the mantel, on the left wing of the line, sat the three months’
bride, Imogene Barksdale, placid, dove-eyed, and smiling as of yore,
very comely with her expression of satisfied prettiness nobody called
vanity, and bedecked in her “second day’s dress” of azure silk and her
bridal ornaments. Her husband hovered on the outside of the ring, now
pulling the floating curls of a girl-cousin (every third girl in
the country was his cousin, once, twice, or thrice-removed, and none
resented the liberties he, as a married man, was pleased to take), anon
whispering in the ear of a bashful maiden interrogatories as to her
latest admirer or rumored engagement; oftenest leaning upon the back
of his wife’s chair, a listener to what was going on, his hand lightly
touching her lace-veiled shoulders, until her head gradually inclined
against his arm. They were a loving couple, and not shy of testifying
their consent to the world.

“They remind me irresistibly of a pair of plump babies sucking at
opposite ends of a stick of sugar candy!” Rosa Tazewell said aside to
the hostess, as the latter paused beside her on her way through the hall
to the parlor.

“The candy is very sweet!” replied Mrs. Aylett, charitably, but laughing
at the conceit--the low, musical laugh that was at once girlish in its
gleefulness, yet perfectly well-bred.

Mr. Aylett heard it from his stand on the parlor-rug, and sent a
quick glance in that direction. It was slow in returning to the
group surrounding him. He had married a beautiful woman--so said
everybody--and a fascinating, as even everybody’s wife did not dispute.
In his sight, she was simply and entirely worthy of the distinction he
had bestowed upon her; an adornment to Ridgeley and his name. From
their wedding-day, his deportment toward her had been the same as it was
to-night--attentive, but never officious; deferential, yet far removed
from servility; a manner that, without approximating uxoriousness, yet
impressed the spectator with the conviction that she was with him first
and dearest among women; a partner of whom, if that were possible, he
was more proud than fond--and of the depth and reality of his affection
there could be no question.

She declined to seat herself in the circle, although warmly importuned
by her guests thus to add brilliancy to their joyous party, yet remained
standing near Rosa, interested and amused by the running fire of
compliment and badinage that went to make up the hilarious confusion. If
the family record had been consulted, the truth that she had counted
her thirty-second summer would have astonished her husband, with her new
neighbors. Apparently she was not over twenty-five. Her chestnut hair
was a marvel for brightness and profusion, her broad brow smooth and
white, her figure, as Winston had described it to his sister, rounded,
even to voluptuousness, yet supple as it had been at fifteen. In her
cheeks, too, the blushes fluctuated readily and softly, and when she
smiled, her teeth showed like those of a little child in size and
purity. Her voice matched her beauty well, never loud, always melodious,
with a peculiar, gliding, legato movement of the graceful sentences, for
the pleasing effect of which she was indebted partly to Nature, and
much more to Art. She appeared on this evening in a green silk dress,
matronly in shade and general style, but not devoid of coquettish
arrangement in the square corsage, the opening of which was filled with
foam-like puffs of thulle, threatening, when her bust heaved in mirth
or animated speech, to overflow the sheeny boundaries. A chaplet of
ivy-leaves encircled her head, and trailed upon one shoulder; her
bracelets were heavy, chased gold without gems of any kind; a single
diamond glittered--a point of prismatic light at her throat. Her
wedding-ring was her only other ornament.

“Very sweet, I grant you, and very flavorless,” returned Rosa. “And
alarmingly apt to turn sour upon the stomach. I had rather be fed upon
pepper lozenges.”

“You should have been born in the Spice Islands,” said the hostess,
tapping the dark cheek with her fore finger. “But we could not spare you
from our wassail-cup to-night, my dear Lady Pimento!”

She bent slightly, that the flattery might reach no other ear. She may
not have known that Rosa’s Creole skin was at a wretched disadvantage,
as seen against the green silk background; but others noticed it, and
thought how few complexions were comparable to the wearer’s. She had the
faculty of converting into a foil nearly every woman who approached her.

“Thank you! So I am pimento, am I?” queried Rosa, pertly. “And each of
us is to personate some condiment--sweet, ardent, or aromatic--in the
exhilarating draught! Which shall Mr. Harrison here be?

“‘Cinnamon or ginger, nutmeg or cloves?’”

“That is a line of a college drinking-song!”

The speaker was a young man of eight-and-twenty; who sat between Rosa
and Mabel, and whose attentions to the latter were marked. Of medium
height, with sandy hair and whiskers, high cheek-bones, that gave a
Gaelic cast to his physiognomy; which was remarkable for nothing in
