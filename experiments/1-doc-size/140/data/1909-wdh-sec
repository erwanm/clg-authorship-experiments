There were cottages, grouped and detached, all the way, 
with gray stone walls and blue slate roofs, and in places 
the children ran out from them with mercenary offer- 
ings of flowers and song, or with frank pleas for charity 
direct. I yielded with reluctance to the instruction of 
a Manchester economist in my carriage, and denied 
them, when I would so much rather have abetted 
them in their wicked attempts on our pockets. I re- 
member ruefully still that they had voices as sweet 
and eyes as dark as the children who used to chase our 
wheels in Italy, and I have no doubt they deserved 
quite as well of us as those did. 

I got back my spirits when we left our carriages, 
and I found myself walking up a pleasant avenue of 
wilding trees, with a young Chautauquan from Austra- 
lia who looked as if he might be a young Chautauquan 
from Alabama, tall, and lean, and brown. We fell into 
talk about the trees, and he said how they differed in 
their green from the sombre gray of his native forests ; 

 

and then he, from that vast far continent of his, spoke 
of the little island where we were, as Home. That has 
always a strange effect for us self - outcasts from the 
great British roof, and whether it makes us smile, or 
makes us sigh, it never fails to startle us when we hear 
it from colonial lips. The word holds in common kind- 
ness Canada and India and South Africa and Austra- 
lia, and it has its pathos in the fact that the old mother 
of these mighty children seems to leave solely to them 
the tenderness that draws them to her in that notion 
of home. 



There were about fifty of those British Chautau- 
quans, and when they had ranged themselves on the 
grass before the shrubbery of a pleasant lawn, backed 
by a wooded slope, the dignified lady of the house came 
out with a casket in her hand, and put it on a table, 
and the exercises began. Fitly, if the casket really held 
the sacred relic, they began with prayer ; then a Welsh 
soloist followed with a hymn, but whether she sang in 
Welsh or English, I do not remember ; I am only sure 
she sang divinely; and then came the speeches. The 
first of the speeches was by our friend, who was the 
local Unitarian minister, and of a religious body not 
inconsiderable in that Calvinistic Wales. He told us 
how the Holy Grail had been deposited with the monks 
of Strata Florida, the famous old abbey near Aberyst- 
wyth; but I forgot who made them this trust, unless 
it was King Arthur's knights, and I am not sure 
whether the fact is matter of legend or history. What 
I remember is that when the abbey was suppressed by 
Henry VIII. , certain of the escaping monks came with 
the relic to the gentle house where we then were, and 

 

placed it in the keeping of the family who have guarded 
it ever since. 

After our friend, the lady of this house took up the 
tale, and told in words singularly choice and simple 
the story of the sacred relic as the family knew it. I 
had only once before heard a woman speak, no less a 
woman than our great and dear Julia Ward Howe, 
and it seemed to me that she spoke better than any 
man; and' I must say of the Chautauquans' hostess, 
that day, that if ever the Englishwomen come into 
their full political rights, as they seem sure to do, 
the traditions of good sense and good taste in Eng- 
lish public speaking will not pass, but will prosper on 
through their orators. There were touches of poetry, 
nationally Welsh, in what she said, and touches of hu- 
mor perhaps personally Welsh. It seems that the cup 
had been famed throughout the countryside for the 
miraculous property by which whoever drank from it 
was cured of his or her malady, and it had been passed 
freely round to all sufferers ever since it came into 
her family's keeping. That they might make doubly 
sure of the miracle, it was the custom of the sick not 
only to empty the cup, but to nibble a little bit of the 
wood, and swallow that, so that in whatever state the 
monks of Strata Florida had confided it, the vessel was 
now in the state we saw. Saying this the lady opened 
the casket holding it, arid showed us the crescent-shaped 
rim of a wooden bowl, about the bigness of a cocoanut 
shell ; all the rest had been consumed by the pious suf- 
ferers whom it had restored to health. 

I am sorry, after all, to own that this cup is said by 
some authorities not to be the Holy Grail, but a vessel 
like it carved out of the true cross. But even so sub- 
ordinate a relic is priceless, and as it is no longer pos- 
sible to drink from it, we may hope that the fragment 

 

will remain indefinitely to after time. When tliej had 
wondered at the sight of it the Chautauquans and their 
friend were made free of the charming seventeenth- 
century house, which would be old for this country, 
but which in the taste of that time was rather mod- 
ern, and looked like the casino of some Italian villa. 
It abounded, as such houses in England do, in the 
pictured faces of the past, and in the memorials which 
only the centuries can leave behind them, but was too 
graceful to seem rich. " A home of ancient peace," it 
looked, in its mild gray stone amidst its lawns and 
shrubberies, the larger hold of the gardens and pleas- 
aunces through which the Chautauquans followed 
from it.

At Aberystwyth, and elsewhere in Wales, one of the 
things I noticed was the difference of the people from 
the people over the English border in their attitude 
toward their betters. They might stand only five feet 
in their stockings, but they stood straight, and if they 
were respectful, they were first self-respectful. In our 
run from Shrewsbury, their language first made itself 
generally heard at Newport, and it increased in the un- 
utterable names of the stations westward, the farther 
we passed into their beautiful country, but they had 
always English enough to be civil, though never servile. 
The country is beautiful in the New England measure, 
but it is of a softer and smaller beauty; it looks more 
caressable ; it is like Vermont rather than New Hamp- 
shire, and it is more like N"ew England than Old Eng- 
land in the greater number of isolated farm-houses, 
from which the girls as well as the boys come to the 
university colleges for learning undreamt of by Eng- 
lish farm villagers.
