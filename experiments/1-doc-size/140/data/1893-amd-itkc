After a while the sun began to throw slanting 
shadows ; the air grew cooler with fragrance from 
streams and sedgy places. Now the rushing of 
the river, here the reverberation among the rocks, 
and presently the wide, warm summer night, mak- 
ing the shadows indistinguishable, or throwing up 
a' cluster of village lights, like sparks struck off 
and vanishing in a second. 

Aunt Jane settled herself comfortably in her 
chair and nodded, and the two girls drew closer 
together. It seemed to Stacy a week since they 
left Chester House, and when they stepped out 
on the platform she stood quite still and helpless. 
Some one came in between. 

"Oh, no," said a refined voice, " I don't think 
she is her daughter. The smaller one really looks 
more like her. But if either of my daughters 
grows up to treat me with such lovely considera- 
tion I shall call myself a happy woman. Besides 
her beauty, she was good to look at. She never 
fidgeted or fretted about the heat. She has such 
exquisite repose of manner that she might be a 
pattern for young womanhood. I was so glad 
when I found they were coming on to Niagara. 
I really wanted to see mora of her" — 

"Stacy," said a soft voice ; and, as the girl 
turned toward Sabrina and the hack, she caught 
sight of a fellow-passenger who had been sitting 





opposite them most of the day. Yes, it was Miss 
Eastwood to whom the lady referred.

They were so tired that the comfort of their 
room was delightful. Aunt Jane was a little dazed 
and confused, but Miss Eastwood seemed just as 
much at home as at Wendover; and it was good 
to go to bed. 

Stacy Delamater colored consciously the next 
morning when she saw her vis-d-vis of the day 
before at the end of the table where the waiter 
seated them. She felt curiously stranded. All 
her girlish audacity seemed to desert her, and she 
watched Sabrina narrowly. Yes, there was some- 
thing admirable about her. She could satirize the 
society airs and graces when they were all on an 
equality at Wendover, but here she saw their 
manifold uses. How charmingly she put Aunt 
Jane forward, and made her appear as if she had 
been used to hotels all her life. There was a 
delicate sort of effacement that Stacy had never 
connected with Miss Eastwood. Her conscience 
pricked her a little as last night's comment came 
back to her. Yes, Sabrina's deference and con- 
sideration made something more than a plain 
countrywoman out of Aunt Jane. She did not 
seem at all apprehensive of the elder woman mak- 
ing blunders or betraying any unaccustomedness. 

Ah, what a day it was ! What days they all 





were ! They studied the marvel of grandeur from 
its many sides and under all varieties of aspects, 
— sunrise and sunset, calm and storm ; for they 
had one afternoon of blinding, driving rain. 

Sabrina listened with new interest to Aunt 
Jane's quaint, delighted comments, and her spirit 
of devout gratitude to the Maker of all things. 
She was learning how sweet a satisfaction one 
might gather in bestowing real pleasures upon 
those whose lives did not abound in such gratifi- 
cations. And she had thought herself tired of 
almost everything ! 

"I feel as if I'd done more than look at the 
promised land ; I've fairly been in it. And the 
Lord just put this in 'your heart, Sabrina. What 
I have to give thanks for is, that you listened and 
went about the Father's business, which, as I take 
it, is giving comfort and joy to human souls. My 
dear, if you and Pearl go on, you'll make the 
waste places blossom like the rose." 

A new and strange humility filled Sabrina East- 
wood's soul. Could she do something besides the 
mere giving of money ? 

" And now," she said, "we must go on to Alex- 
andria Bay. It would be a shame to come so 
near and not see the famous Thousand Isles. It 
doesn't really take us out of our way." 

" My dear, you're too generous to an old woman 
like me!" 




What a world of beauty this was ! What bits 
of poetry it suggested ! They could have lin- 
gered forever in this scene. And then there was 
Lake Champlain and the Au Sable, romantic and 
historic ground. They sailed and drove and ram- 
bled, took railroad journeys hither and thither, 
coming at last down the State of Vermont to the 
little south-westerly corner of New Hampshire, 
with its farms glowing in all the plenitude of 
late summer. 

Mrs. Ford gave the travellers a most hospitable 
welcome. There were suggestions of Aunt Jane 
about her ; but, even with the interest of children 
who had grown up and married, her life had set- 
tled into narrower lines. There had been no wide 
outlooks into the greater world. 

A very plain, old-time farmhouse it was, with 
its high-peaked roof and overhanging eaves, its 
low ceilings and great rooms, its small windows 
with greenish panes of glass, its wide chimneys, 
and high, narrow mantels. The kitchen floor was 
worn and uneven, in spite of its yearly coat of 
paint. Here and there a rug of braided rags ; 
chairs with seats of stout list, the original splints
