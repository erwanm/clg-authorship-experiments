" Put it down, then." 

" Is that your lowest price ? ' asked Bobby, who 
was as cool as a cucumber. 

" Yes, it is ; and if you don't put it down, I'll kick 
you out of the store." 

' ' Will you ? Then I won't put it down." 

Mr. Timmins took this as a " 4 stump ; ' his ire was 
up, and he walked round from behind the counter to 
execute his threat. 

I must say I think Bobby was a little forward, and 
I would have my young readers a little more pliant 
with small men like Timmins. There are always men 
enough in the world who are ready and willing to 



 

quarrel on any provocation ; and it is always best not 
to provoke them, even if they are overbearing and in- 
solent, as Mr. Timmins certainly was. 

" Hold on a minute before you do it," said Bobby, 
with the same provoking coolness. " I want to buy 
this book, and I am willing to pay a fair price for it. 
But I happen to know that you can buy them up in 
Riverdale, where I came from, for six cents." 

" No matter," exclaimed the indignant clerk, seiz- 
ing Bobby by the coat collar for the purpose of eject- 
ing him; " you shall find your way into the street." 

Xow, Bobby, as I have before intimated, was an 
embryo American citizen, and the act of Mr. Timmins 
seemed like an invasion of his inalienable rights. 



No time was given him to make a formal declaration 
of rights in the premises ; so the instinct of self-pres- 
ervation was allowed to have free course. 

Mr. Timmins pulled and tugged at his coat collar, 
and Bobby hung back like a mule ; and for an instant 
there was quite a spirited scene. 

" Hallo ! Timmins, what does this mean ? ' said a 
voice, at which the valiant little clerk instantly let go 
his hold. 






CHAPTER VIII. 

IN WHICH MR. TIMMINS IS ASTONISHED, AND 
BOBBY DINES IN CHESTNUT STREET. 



IT was Mr. Bayard. He had finished his business 
with the gentleman by his side, and hearing the noise 
of the scuffle, had come to learn the occasion of it. 

" This impudent young puppy wouldn't let the 
books alone ! " began Mr. Timmins. " I threatened 
to turn him out if he didn't ; and I meant to make 
good my threat. I think he meant to steal some- 
thing." 

Bobby was astonished and shocked at this bold im- 
putation ; but he wished to have his case judged on 
its own merits, so he turned his face away, that Mr. 
Bayard might not recognize him. 

" I wanted to buy one of these blank books," add- 
ed Bobby, picking up the one he had dropped on the 
floor in the struggle. 




All stuff! " ejaculated Timmins. "lie is an im- 
pudent, obstinate puppy ! In my opinion he meant 
to steal that book." 

"I asked him the price, and told him I wanted to 
buy it," added Bobby, still averting his face. 

" Well, I told him ; and he said it was too high." 

"He asked me twenty-five cents for it." 

" Is this true, Timmins ? ' asked Mr. Bayard, 
sternly. 

" No, sir ! I told him fourpence," replied Timmins 
boldly. 

" By gracious ! What a whopper ! ' exclaimed 
Bobby, startled out of his propriety by this mon- 
strous lie. " He said twenty-five cents ; and I told 
him I could buy one up in Riverdale, where I came 
from, for six cents. Can you deny that ? ' 

" It's a lie ! " protested Timmins. 

"Riverdale," said Mr. Bayard. "Are you from 
Riverdale, boy ? ' 

" Yes, sir, I am ; and if you will look on your 
memorandum book you will find my name there." 

" Bless me ! I am sure I have seen that face before," 
exclaimed Mr. Bayard, as he grasped the hand of 



 

Bobby, much to the astonishment and consternation 

of Mr. Timmins. " You are " 

" Robert Bright, sir."
