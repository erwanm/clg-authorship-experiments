Miss Barry believed in work devoutly, but gentlewomen had a firm place
in her creed. The paintings and music were well enough as
accomplishments, and she was proud of them; but she delicately repressed
the other dreams and desires until Sylvie ceased to speak of them except
to her friend Jack.

Miss Barry had experienced some anxiety on this point, it must be
confessed. You would never have perceived it from the wise little
woman's face or any tone of her voice. She went more frequently to the
Darcys of an evening with Sylvie: she rolled her easy-chair and
work-table to the opposite side of the sitting-room, where it commanded
a view of the piano and the sofa in the parlor, the door being always
open. She could hear and see, she could make pleasant, trenchant
remarks: indeed, she was one of themselves, as young in heart, if the
hair did glisten silvery under the bit of exquisite thread-lace that did
duty as an apology for a cap.

Jack and Sylvie were not lovers. A rare good friendship it was, more
perfect than brotherly and sisterly regard, in that it held no
duty-element, and was spontaneous. Sylvie never laughed at Jack in his
awkward boyish days: he had never tormented her small belongings as
brothers are wont to do.

Miss Barry feared the flame might be easily fanned. A little opposition
or warning would bring Sylvie's innocent wandering thoughts to a focus,
and kindle the fire. She was very wary. She trusted Sylvie to Jack with
an air that said, "You are too honorable to betray the confidence I
repose in you."

The old class prejudice spoke out in this covert objection to Jack as
a suitor. She honored him sincerely for giving up the dreams of
ambitious and energetic manhood to stay at home and comfort these two
delicate women. Yet (strange contradiction) she had a half fancy that it
betokened weakness or lack of some kind in the very content with which
he seemed to go about his daily duties. Alas for consistency! We preach
content from the pulpit on Sunday, and on Monday glance with quiet
contempt on our plodding neighbor, who can commune with the daisies by
the wayside, while there is gold lying untroubled in desert gulches.

Honest, sturdy Jack, taking up the duty of to-day cheerfully with a
manful endurance, because the hands holding his fate were too weak and
tender to be wrestled with, and that in his large, generous soul he
could not war on a smaller antagonist, neither was it his nature to
continually thrust any sacrifice he might make before the eyes of the
one he was benefiting. How much silent heroism goes unpraised in the
world, while we stand on the highways, and prate of our discrimination,
our quick insight! Jack might be praised for his self-denial, but the
higher appreciation was withheld. Even Sylvie was fretted at times,
because he would get interested in all things pertaining to the mill.

Miss Barry said to herself, "It is best that Sylvie should marry in her
own circle, a man of cultivation, refinement, and position. Jack is a
dear good fellow, but not the person to satisfy her for a lifetime."

Jack thought nothing at all about it. He never gave up the idea of a
great wide world, where he could have a hand-to-hand struggle with
something as powerful as himself. He had come to no dreams of wife and
children. He did like Sylvie with all his big, honest heart. If she had
fallen in love with him, and betrayed it by some girlish sign, he would
have been startled at first, then thought it over in his slow, careful
way, asked her to marry him, and loved her devotedly all his days,
leaving the dreams to the past with a tender benediction.

But Sylvie was no more in love than he.

As I said, she decided that she was not needed at Hope Terrace, and
staid away four days. Then the carriage came, with a beseeching note.
Had Fred gone again?

She found him there in all his elegant listlessness. It exasperated her
strangely.

"What have you been about, Sylvie?" cried Mrs. Lawrence. "Is your aunt
ill? It seems a full week since you were here."

"Oh, no!" with her beguiling little smile. "I cannot tell exactly what,
only I thought"--

"You thought because Fred was home I would need no one else! As if a
love-story would not bore him, and an invalid's whims--well, men are not
women, my dear," decisively, and with a complacent expression as if she
had settled the argument beyond any question, for the first time since
the world began.

"Why, you never tried me on a love-story," interposed Fred. "You do not
know how deeply sympathetic I might be with your favorite heroines."

"He is laughing at us, Sylvie. Ah, well! I suppose it is a man's duty to
make love, not to listen to it second-hand. How charming and fresh you
look this morning! And how lovely it is after the shower of last night!
Fred, if you could leave Latin verses and Greek essays you might take us
to drive. We could stop and bring your aunt with us for lunch, Sylvie."

"Thank you for her. She has gone to Coldbridge to see about a nurse for
the Orphans' Home, and will not be back until four."

"Then I can keep you without a single scruple," and Mrs. Lawrence looked
oddly pleased. "Fred, tell them not to put the horses out. What
wonderful health your aunt has, Sylvie! I don't see how she can endure
the bother of those schools and institutions: it would wear me out in
no time. But I have had a family of children;" and she leaned back on
her pillow with a satisfied air.

The carriage came around again; and with the assistance of a maid,
Sylvie, and her son, Mrs. Lawrence walked down stairs. He handed both
ladies in, and seated himself opposite with the air of a prince.

Sylvie looked so bright and gay this morning, her velvety eyes full of
tender light, her cheek all abloom with youth and health, the sweet
scarlet lips half smiling, and her attire far enough removed from the
rigor of fashion to have a kind of originality about it. She always wore
something that added tone and brightness,--a bit of colored ribbon or a
flower, or a bow that flashed out unexpectedly, as if greeting you with
laughing surprise.

"What do you do to mother, Sylvie?" Fred asked, with a touch of
complimentary curiosity in his voice. "Yesterday she was dull and
moping. I could not persuade her to drive."

"It was so warm, no wonder. I felt dull and drowsy myself. But to-day is
the perfection of loveliness."

"And you have a charm, Sylvie. I do not know but it is your perfect,
buoyant health. You seem to lift one up. I only wish I could keep you
all the time," remarked Mrs. Lawrence with a touch of longing.

Sylvie colored, and averted her eyes: then she gave herself a kind of
mental shaking, and resolutely glanced back, uttering some rather trite
remark. She would not suspect or understand.

They came home again, and had lunch: then, while Mrs. Lawrence was
taking her siesta, Fred carried off Sylvie to his study. It was
luxuriously beautiful. Several gems of pictures adorned the wall, which
had been newly frescoed to suit his fancy. Easy chairs lured one to test
their capacious depth, some exquisitely-bound books were arranged in a
carved and polished case, and the table was daintily littered with
papers. He had an idea that a man's surroundings were a very fair index
to his character and tastes, quite forgetting that it implied length of
purse as well.
