I know of, so I cannot define it. Then a swift 
awful tragedy — I cannot recall the details of 
that, either. The whole dream was like a 
black mass of clouds, cut now and again by a 
scythe of lightning. But then, like a vision 
within a dream, I seemed to stand there and 
see myself, clad in a black gown, walking up 
and down this corridor, or one like it, up and 
down, up and down, never resting, never 
daring to rest, lest I hear the ceaseless clatter of a 
lonely fugitive's horse. When I awoke I was 
as cold as if I had received the first shock of 
the surf. I cannot say why I put on this black 
gown to-day. I make no haste to feel as I did 
when I wore it in that dream, — the desolation, 
the endlessness but I did." 


''That was a strange dream, my Chonita," 
said Prudencia, threading her needle. "Thou 
must have eater '^too many dulces for supper : 
didst thou ? " 

'* No," said Chonita, shortly, " I did not." 

She continued her aimless walk, wondering 
at her depression of spirits. All her life she had 
felt a certain mental loneliness, but a healthy 
body rarely harbors an invalid soul, and she 
had only to spring on a horse and gallop over 
the hills to feel as happy as a young animal. 
Moreover, the world — all the world she knew 
— was at her feet ; nor had she ever known the 
novelty of an ungratified wish. Once in a 
while her father arose in an obdurate mood, 
but she had only to coax, or threaten tears, — 
never had she been seen to shed one, — or stamp 
her foot, to bring that doting parent to terms. 
It is true that she had had her morbid moments, 
an abrupt impatient desire for something that 
was not all light and pleasure and gold and ad- 
ulation ; but, being a girl of will and sense, 
she had turned resolutely from the troublous 
demands of her deeper soul, regarding them as 
coals fallen from a mind that burned too hotly 
at times. 

This morning, however, she let the blue 
waters rise, not so rnucb because they were 




stronger than her will, as because she wished 
to understand what was the matter with her. 
She was filled with a dull dislike of every one 
she had ever known, of every condition which 
had surrounded her from birth. She felt a deep 
disgust of placid contentment, of the mere 
enjoyment of sunshine and air. She recalled 
drearily the clock-like revolutions of the year 
which brought bull-fights, races, rodeos, church 
celebrations ; her mother's anecdotes of the 
Indians ; her father's manifold interests, ever 
the theme of his tongue ; Reinaldo's 
grandiloquent accounts of his exploits and intentions ; 
Prudencia's infinite nothings. She hated the 
balls of which she was La Favorita, the 
everlasting serenades, the whole life of pleasure 
which made that period of California the most 
perfected Arcadia the modern world has known. 
Some time during the past few weeks the girl 
had crossed her hands over her breast and lain 
down in her eternal tomb. The woman had 
arisen and come forth, blinded as yet by the 
light, her hands thrust out gropingly. 

" It is that man, "she told herself, with angry 
frankness. "I had not talked with him ten 
minutes before I felt as I do when the scene 
changes suddenly in one of Shakespeare's 
plays, — as if I had been flung like a meteor into 

a new world. I felt the necessity for mental 
alertness for the first time in my life ; always, 
before, I had striven to conceal what I knew. 
The natural consequences, of course, were first 
the desire to feel that stimulation again and 
agc.in, then to realize the littleness of every- 
thing but mental companionship. I have read 
that people who begin with hate sometimes 
end with love ; and if I were a book woman I 
suppose I should in time love this man whom 
I now so hate, even while I admire. But I am 
no lump of wax in^ the hands of a writer of 
dreams. I am Chonita Iturbi y Moncada, and 
he is Diego Estenega. I could no more love 
him than could the equator kiss the poles. 
Only, much as I hate him, I wish I could see 
him again. He knows so much more than 
any one else. I should like to talk to him, to 
ask him many things. He has sworn to marry 
me." Her lip curled scornfully, but a sudden 
glow rushed over her. " Had he not been an 
Estenega, — yes, I could have loved him, — that 
calm, clear-sighted love that is born of regard ; 
not a whirlwind and a collapse, like most love. 
I should like to sit with my hands in my lap 
and hear him talk forever. And we cannot 
even be friends. It is a pity." 

The girls mind was like a splendid castle 


only one wing of which had ever been 
illuminated. By the light of the books she had read, 
and of acute observation in a little sphere, she 
strove to penetrate the thick walls and carry the 
torch into broader halls and lofty towers. But 
superstition, prejudice, bitter pride, 
inexperience of life, conjoined their shoulders and 
barred the way. As Diego Estenega had 
discerned, under the thick Old- World shell of 
inherited impressions was a plastic being of all 
womanly possibilities. But so little did she 
know of herself, so futile was her struggle in 
the dark with only sudden flashes to blind her 
and distort all she saw, that with nothing to 
shape that moulding kernel it would shrink and 
wither, and in a few years she would be but a 
polished shell, perfect of proportion, hollow at 
the core. 

But if strong intellectual juices sank into that 
sweet, pliant kernel, developing it into the 
perfected form of woman, establishing the current 
between the brain and the passions, finishing the 
work, or leaving it half completed, as 
Circumstance vouchsafed ? — what then ?
