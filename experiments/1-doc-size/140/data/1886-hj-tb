was fine and the lighted streets had the animation and 
variety of a winter that had begun with brilliancy. The 
shop-fronts glowed through frosty panes, the passers bustled 
on the pavement, the bells of the street-cars jangled in the 
cold air, the newsboys hawked the evening -papers, the 
vestibules of the theatres, illuminated and flanked with col- 
oured posters and the photographs of actresses, exhibited 
seductively their swinging doors of red leather or baize, 
spotted with little brass nails. Behind great plates of glass 
the interior of the hotels became visible, with marble-paved 
lobbies, white with electric lamps, and columns, and West- 
erners on divans stretching their legs, while behind a counter, 
set apart and covered with an array of periodicals and 
novels in paper covers, little boys, with the faces of old 
men, showing plans of the play-houses and offering librettos, 
sold orchestra-chairs at a premium. When from time to 
time Ransom paused at a corner, hesitating which way to 
drift, he looked up and saw the stars, sharp and near, scin- 
tillating over the town. Boston seemed to him big and full 
of nocturnal life, very much awake and preparing for an 
evening of pleasure. 



 

He passed and repassed the Music Hall, saw Verena 
immensely advertised, gazed down the vista, the approach 
for pedestrians, which leads out of School Street, and 
thought it looked expectant and ominous. People had not 
begun to enter yet, but the place was ready, lighted and 
open, and the interval would be only too short. So it ap- 
peared to Ransom, while at the same time he wished im- 
mensely the crisis were over. Everything that surrounded 
him referred itself to the idea with which his mind was 
palpitating, the question whether he might not still inter- 
vene as against the girl's jump into the abyss. He believed 
that all Boston was going to hear her, or that at least every 
one was whom he saw in the streets; and there was a kind of 
incentive and inspiration in this thought. The vision of 
wresting her from the mighty multitude set him off again, 
to stride through the population that would fight for her. 
It was not too late, for he felt strong ; it would not be too 
late even if she should already stand there before thousands 
of converging eyes. He had had his ticket since the 
morning, and now the time was going on. He went back 
to his hotel at last for ten minutes, and refreshed himself 
by dressing a little and by drinking a glass of wine. Then 
he took his way once more to the Music Hall, and saw that 
people were beginning to go in the first drops of the great 
stream, among whom there were many women. Since 
seven o'clock the minutes had moved fast before that they 
had dragged and now there was only half an hour. Ran- 
som passed in with the others ; he knew just where his seat 
was ; he had chosen it, on reaching Boston, from the few 
that were left, with what he believed to be care. But now, 
as he stood beneath the far-away panelled roof, stretching 
above the line of little tongues of flame which marked its 
junction with the walls, he felt that this didn't matter much, 
since he certainly was not going to subside into his place. 
He was not one of the audience ; he was apart, unique, 
and had come on a business altogether special. It wouldn't 
have mattered if, in advance, he had got no place at all 
and had just left himself to pay for standing-room at the 
last. The people came pouring in, and in a very short time 
there would only be standing-room left. Ransom had no 



definite plan ; he had mainly wanted to get inside of the 
building, so that, on a view of the field, he might make up 
his mind. He had never been in the Music Hall before, 
and its lofty vaults and rows of overhanging balconies made 
it to his imagination immense and impressive. There were 
two or three moments during which he felt as he could 
imagine a young man to feel who, waiting in a public place, 
has made up his mind, for reasons of his own, to discharge 
a pistol at the king or the president. 

The place struck him with a kind of Roman vastness ; 
the doors which opened out of the upper balconies, high 
aloft, and which were constantly swinging to and fro with 
the passage of spectators and ushers, reminded him of the 
vomitoria that he had read about in descriptions of the 
Colosseum. The huge organ, the background of the stage 
a stage occupied with tiers of seats for choruses and 
civic worthies lifted to the dome its shining pipes and 
sculptured pinnacles, and some genius of music or oratory 
erected himself in monumental bronze at the base. The 
hall was so capacious and serious, and the audience in- 
creased so rapidly without filling it, giving Ransom a sense 
of the numbers it would contain when it was packed, that 
the courage of the two young women, face to face with so 
tremendous an ordeal, hovered before him as really sublime, 
especially the conscious tension of poor Olive, who would 
have been spared none of the anxieties and tremors, none 
of the previsions of accident or calculations of failure. In 
the front of the stage was a slim, high desk, like a music- 
stand, with a cover of red velvet, and near it was a light 
ornamental chair, on which he was sure Verena would not 
seat herself, though he could fancy her leaning at moments 
on the back. Behind this was a kind of semicircle of a 
dozen arm-chairs, which had evidently been arranged for 
the friends of the speaker, her sponsors and patrons. The 
hall was more and more full of premonitory sounds ; people 
making a noise as they unfolded, on hinges, their seats, and 
itinerant boys, whose voices as they cried out ' Photographs 
of Miss Tarrant sketch of her life !' or 'Portraits of the 
Speaker story of her career !' sounded small and piping 
in the general immensity. Before Ransom was aware of it 



 

several of the arm-chairs, in the row behind the lecturer's 
desk, were occupied, with gaps, and in a moment he re- 
cognised, even across the interval, three of the persons who 
had appeared. The straight-featured woman with bands of 
glossy hair and eyebrows that told at a distance, could only 
be Mrs. Farrinder, just as the gentleman beside her, in a 
white overcoat, with an umbrella and a vague face, was 
probably her husband Amariah. At the opposite end of 
the row were another pair, whom Ransom, unacquainted 
with certain chapters of Verena's history, perceived without 
surprise to be Mrs. Burrage and her insinuating son. Ap- 
parently their interest in Miss Tarrant was more than a 
momentary fad, since like himself they had made the 
journey from New York to hear her. There were other 
figures, unknown to our young man, here and there, in the 
semicircle; but several places were still empty (one of which 
was of course reserved for Olive), and it occurred to 
Ransom, even in his preoccupation, that one of them ought 
to remain so ought to be left to symbolise the presence, 
in the spirit, of Miss Birdseye. 

He bought one of the photographs of Verena, and 
thought it shockingly bad, and bought also the sketch of 
her life, which many people seemed to be reading, but 
crumpled it. up in his pocket for future consideration.
