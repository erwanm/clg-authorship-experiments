make a good Saint Nicholas — the kind they have 
going down chimneys in America. I'm going to 
tell him, for the next veglione. It would be such a 
nice surprise." 

" No, better not tell him that," suggested Imogene. 

" Do you think he wouldn't like it ? " 

" Yes." 

"Well, it would become him. How old do you 
suppose he is, Imogene ? Seventy-iive t " 

" What an idea ! " cried the girl fiercely. " He 's 
forty-one." 

"I didn't know they had those httle jiggering 
lines at the corners of their eyes so quick. But 
forty-one is pretty old, isn't it ? Is Mr. Waters- " 



 

"Effie," said her mother's voice at the door be- 
hind her, " will you ring for Griovanni, and tell him 
to bring me a cup of coffee in here ? " She spoke 
from the portiere of the salotto. 

" Yes, mamma. I 'll bring it to you myself." 

"Thank you, dear," Mrs. Bowen called from 
within. 

The little girl softly pressed her hands together. 
" I hope she 'll let me stay up ! I feel so excited, 
and I hate to lie and think so long before I get to 
sleep. Couldn't you just hint a little to her that I 
might stay up ? It 's Sunday night." 

"I can't, -Effie," said Imogene. "I oughtn't to 
interfere with any of your mother's rules." 

The child sighed submissively and took the coffee 
that Giovanni brought to her. She and Imogene 
went into the salotto together. Mrs. Bowen was at 
her writing-desk. " You can bring the coffee here, 
Effie," she said. 

" Must I go to bed at once, mamma ? " asked the 
child, setting the cup carefully down. 

The mother looked distractedly, up from her 
writing. " No ; you may sit up a while," she said, 
looking back to her writing. 

" How long, mamma ? " pleaded the little girl. 

" Oh, till you 're sleepy. It doesn't matter now." 

She went on writing ; from time to time she tore 
up what she had written. 

Effie softly took a book from the table, and 
perching herself on a stiff, high chair, bent over it 
and began to read. 



 

Imogene sat by the hearth, where a small fire was 
pleasant in the indoor chill of an Italian house, 
even after sO warm a day as that had been. She 
took some large beads of the strand she wore about 
her neck into her mouth, and pulled at the strand 
listjessly with her hand while she watched the fire. 
Her eyes wandered once to the child. 

" What made you take such an uncomfortable 
chair, Effie ? " 

Effie shut her book over her hand. " It keeps me 
wakeful longer," she whispered, with a glance at her 
mother from the corner of her eye. 

" I don't see why any one should • wish to be 
wakeful," sighed the girl. 

When Mrs. Bowen tore up one of her half-written 
pages Imogene started nervously forward, and then 
relapsed again into her chair. At last Mrs. Bowen 
seemed to find the right phrases throughout, and 
she finished rather a long letter, and read it over to 
herself. Then she said, without leaving her desk, 
" Imogene, I 've been trying to write to your 
mother. Will you look at this ? " 

She held the sheet over her shoulder, and Imo- 
gene came languidly and took it; Mrs. Bowen 
dropped her face forward on the desk, into her 
hands, while Imogene was reading. 

" Florence, March 10, 18— 
"Dear Mrs. Graham, — I have some very important 
news to give you in regard to Imogene, and as there is no 
way of preparing you for it, I will tell you at once that 
it relates to her marriage. 



 

" She has met at my house a gentleman whom I knew 
in Florence when I was here before, and of whom I never 
knew anything but good. We have seen him very often, 
and I have seen nothing in him that I could not approve. 
He is Mr. Theodore Colville, of Prairie des Vaches, Indiana, 
where he was for many years a newspaper editor ; but he 
was born somewhere in New England. He is a very culti- 
vated, interesting man ; and though not exactly a society 
man, he is very agreeable and refined in his manners. I 
am sure his character is irreproachable, though he is not a 
member of any church. In regard to his means I know 
nothing whatever, and can only infer from his way of life 
that he is in easy circumstances. 

" The whole matter has been a surprise to me, for Mr. 
Colville is some twenty-one or two years older than Imo- 
gene, who is very young in her feelings for a girl of her 
age. If I could have realised anything like a serious 
attachment between them sooner, I would have written 
before. Even now I do not know whether I am to consider 
them engaged or not. No doubt Imogene will write you 
more fully. 

" Of course I would rather not have had anything of the 
kind happen while Imogene was under my charge, though 
I am sure that you will not think I have been careless or
