which can always be decent in Italy. It was bare, 
but for the books that furnished it ; with a table for 
his writing, on a corner of which he breakfasted, a 
wide sofa with cushions in coarse white linen that 
frankly confessed itself a bed by night, and two 



 

chairs of plain Italian walnut ; but the windows, 
which had no sun, looked out upon the church and 
the convent sacred to the old Socinian for the sake 
of the meek, heroic mystic whom they keep alive in 
all the glory of his martyrdom. No two minds 
could well have been further apart than the New 
England minister and the Florentine nionk, and no 
two souls nearer together, as Colville recognised 
with a not irreverent smile. 

When the old man was not looking up some point 
of his saint's history in his books, he was taking 
with the hopefulness of youth and the patience of 
age a lesson in colloquial Italian from his land- 
lady's daughter, which he pronounced with a 
scholarly scrupulosity and a sincere atonic Massa- 
chusetts accent. He practised the language wher- 
ever he could, especially at the trattoria where he 
dined, and where he made occasions to detain the 
waiter in conversation. They humoured him, out 
of their national good-heartedness and sympathy, 
and they did what they could to realise a strange 
American dish for him on Sundays — a combination 
of stockfish and potatoes boiled, and then fried 
together in small cakes. They revered him as a 
foreign gentleman of saintly amiability and incom- 
prehensible preferences ; and he was held in equal 
regard at the next green-grocer's where he spent every 
morning five centessimi for a bunch of radishes and 
ten for a little pat of butter to eat with his bread and 
coffee ; he could not yet accustom himself to mere 
bread- and coffee for breakfast, though he conformed 



 

as completely as he could to the Italian way of living. 
He respected the abstemiousness of the race; he 
held that it came from a spirituality of nature to 
wliich the North was still strange, with all its con- 
science and sense of individual accountability. He 
contended that he never suffered in his small deal- 
ings with these people from the dishonesty which 
most of his countrymen complained of; and he 
praised their unfailing gentleness of manner; this 
could arise only from goodness of heart, which was 
perhaps the best kind of goodness after all. 

None of these humble acquaintance of his could 
well have accounted for the impression they all had 
that he was some sort of ecclesiastic. They could 
never have understood — nor, for that matter, could 
any one have understood through European tradi- 
tion — the sort of sacerdotal office that Mr. Waters 
had filled so long in the little deeply book-clubbed 
New England village where he had outlived most of 
his flock, till one day he rose in the midst of the sur- 
viving dyspeptics and consumptives and, following 
the example of Mr. Emerson, renounced his calling 
for ever. By that time even the pale Unitarianism 
thinning out into paler doubt was no longer tenable 
with him. He confessed that while he felt the 
Divine goodness more and more, he believed that it 
was a mistake to preach any specific creed or doctrine, 
and he begged them to release him from their ser- 
vice. A young man came to fill his place in their 
pulpit, but he kept his place in their hearts. They 
raised a subscription of seventeen hundred dollars 



 

and thirty-five cents; another being submitted to the 
new button manufacturer, who had founded his in- 
dustry in the village, he promptly rounded it out to 
three thousand, and Mr. Waters came to Florence. 
His people parted with him in terms of regret as 
delicate as they were awkward, and their love fol- 
lowed him. He corresponded regularly with two or 
three ladies, and his letters were sometimes read 
from his pulpit. 

Colville took the Piazza San Marco in on his way 
to Palazzo Pinti on the morning when he had made 
up his mind to go there, and he stood at the window 
looking out with the old man, when some more 
maskers passed through the place — two young fellows 
in old Florentine dress, with a third habited as a nun. 

"Ah," said the old man gently, "I wish they 
hadn't introduced the nun ! But I suppose they 
can't help signalising their escape from the domina- 
tion of the Church on all occasions. It 's a natural 
reaction. It will all come right in time." 

" You preach the true American gospel," said Col- 
ville. 

" Of course ; there is no other gospel. That is 
the gospel." 

" Do you suppose that Savonarola would think it 
had all come out right," asked Colville, a little mali- 
ciously, "if he could look from the window with us 
here and see the wicked old Carnival, that he tried 
so hard to kill four hundred years ago, still alive ? 
And kicking ?" he added, in cognisance of the caper 
of one of the maskers. 



 

" Oh yes ; why not ? By this time he knows that 
his puritanisra was all a mistake, unless as a thing 
for the moment only. I should rather like to have 
Savonarola here with us ; he would find these cos- 
tumes familiar ; they are of his time. I shall make 
a point of seeing all I can of the Carnival, as part of 
my study of Savonarola, if nothing else." 

" I 'm afraid you 'll have to give yourself limita- 
tions,'' said Colville, as one of the maskers threw his 
arm round the mock-nun's neck. But the old man 
did not see this, and Colville did not feel it necessary 
to explain himself. 

The maskers had passed out of the piazza now, and
