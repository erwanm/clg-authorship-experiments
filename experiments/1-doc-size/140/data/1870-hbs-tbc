policy at that time was to make large general confessions of sin,
and to praise and compliment her, with a view of enlisting sympathy.
Everybody feels for a handsome sinner, weeping on his knees, asking
pardon for his offences against his wife in the public newspapers.
The celebrated 'Fare thee well', as we are told, was written on the
17th of March, and accidentally found its way into the newspapers at
this time 'through the imprudence of a friend whom he allowed to take a
copy.' These 'imprudent friends' have all along been such a marvellous
convenience to Lord Byron.
But the question met him on all sides, What is the matter? This wife
you have declared the brightest, sweetest, most amiable of beings, and
against whose behaviour as a wife you actually never had nor can have
a complaint to make,--why is she now all of a sudden so inflexibly
set against you?
This question required an answer, and he answered by writing another
poem, which also accidentally found its way into the public prints.
It is in his 'Domestic Pieces,' which the reader may refer to at the
end of this volume, and is called 'A Sketch.'
There was a most excellent, respectable, well-behaved Englishwoman, a
Mrs. Clermont,[3] who had been Lady Byron's governess in her youth,
and was still, in mature life, revered as her confidential friend. It
appears that this person had been with Lady Byron during a part of her
married life, especially the bitter hours of her lonely child-bed, when
a young wife so much needs a sympathetic friend. This Mrs. Clermont was
the person selected by Lord Byron at this time to be the scapegoat to
bear away the difficulties of the case into the wilderness.
[Footnote 3: In Lady Blessington's 'Memoirs' this name is given
Charlemont; in the late 'Temple Bar' article on the character of Lady
Byron it is given Clermont. I have followed the latter.]
We are informed in Moore's Life what a noble pride of rank Lord Byron
possessed, and how when the headmaster of a school, against whom he had
a pique, invited him to dinner, he declined, saying, 'To tell you the
truth, Doctor, if you should come to Newstead, I shouldn't think of
inviting you to dine with me, and so I don't care to dine with you
here.' Different countries, it appears, have different standards as to
good taste; Moore gives this as an amusing instance of a young lord's
spirit.
Accordingly, his first attack against this 'lady,' as we Americans
should call her, consists in gross statements concerning her having
been born poor and in an inferior rank. He begins by stating that she
was
  'Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,
  Promoted thence to deck her mistress' head;
  Next--for some gracious service unexpressed
  And from its wages only to be guessed--
  Raised from the toilet to the table, where
  Her wondering betters wait behind her chair.
  With eye unmoved and forehead unabashed.
  She dines from off the plate she lately washed;
  Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,
  The genial confidante and general spy,--
  Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess,--
  An only infant's earliest governess!
  What had she made the pupil of her art
  None knows; but that high soul secured the heart,
  And panted for the truth it could not hear
  With longing soul and undeluded ear!'[4]
[Footnote 4: The italics are mine.]
The poet here recognises as a singular trait in Lady Byron her peculiar
love of truth,--a trait which must have struck everyone that had any
knowledge of her through life. He goes on now to give what he certainly
knew to be the real character of Lady Byron:--
  'Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,
  Which flattery fooled not, baseness could not blind,
  Deceit infect not, nor contagion soil,
  Indulgence weaken, or example spoil,
  Nor mastered science tempt her to look down
  On humbler talent with a pitying frown,
  Nor genius swell, nor beauty render vain,
  Nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain.
We are now informed that Mrs. Clermont, whom he afterwards says in his
letters was a spy of Lady Byron's mother, set herself to make mischief
between them. He says:--
  'If early habits,--those strong links that bind
  At times the loftiest to the meanest mind,
  Have given her power too deeply to instil
  The angry essence of her deadly will;
  If like a snake she steal within your walls,
  Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;
  If like a viper to the heart she wind,
  And leaves the venom there she did not find,--
  What marvel that this hag of hatred works
  Eternal evil latent as she lurks.'
The noble lord then proceeds to abuse this woman of inferior rank in
the language of the upper circles. He thus describes her person and
manner:--
  'Skilled by a touch to deepen scandal's tints
  With all the kind mendacity of hints,
  While mingling truth with falsehood, sneers with smiles,
  A thread of candour with a web of wiles;
  A plain blunt show of briefly-spoken seeming,
  To hide her bloodless heart's soul-harden'd scheming;
  A lip of lies; a face formed to conceal,
  And without feeling mock at all who feel;
  With a vile mask the Gorgon would disown,--
  A cheek of parchment and an eye of stone.
  Mark how the channels of her yellow blood
  Ooze to her skin and stagnate there to mud,
  Cased like the centipede in saffron mail,
  Or darker greenness of the scorpion's scale,--
  (For drawn from reptiles only may we trace
  Congenial colours in that soul or face,)
  Look on her features! and behold her mind
  As in a mirror of itself defined:
  Look on the picture! deem it not o'ercharged
  There is no trait which might not be enlarged.'
The poem thus ends:--
  'May the strong curse of crushed affections light
  Back on thy bosom with reflected blight,
  And make thee in thy leprosy of mind
  As loathsome to thyself as to mankind!
  Till all thy self-thoughts curdle into hate,
  Black--as thy will for others would create;
  Till thy hard heart be calcined into dust,
  And thy soul welter in its hideous crust.
  O, may thy grave be sleepless as the bed,
  The widowed couch of fire, that thou hast spread
  Then when thou fain wouldst weary Heaven with prayer,
  Look on thy earthly victims--and despair!
  Down to the dust! and as thou rott'st away,
  Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.
  But for the love I bore and still must bear
  To her thy malice from all ties would tear,
  Thy name,--thy human name,--to every eye
  The climax of all scorn, should hang on high,
  Exalted o'er thy less abhorred compeers,
  And festering in the infamy of years.'
  March 16, 1816.
Now, on the 29th of March 1816, this was Lord Byron's story. He states
that his wife had a truthfulness even from early girlhood that the most
artful and unscrupulous governess could not pollute,--that she always
panted for truth,--that flattery could not fool nor baseness blind
her,--that though she was a genius and master of science, she was yet
gentle and tolerant, and one whom no envy could ruffle to retaliate
pain.
In September of the same year she is a monster of unscrupulous deceit
and vindictive cruelty. Now, what had happened in the five months
between the dates of these poems to produce such a change of opinion?
Simply this:--
1st. The negotiation between him and his wife's lawyers had ended in
