Suddenly she stopped and cried, "Where are we?" And 
there came a peal of merry laughter, as she discovered they 
had gone far astray. They turned and set off in the right 
direction, and meantime the lecture on advance feminism con- 
tinued. Poor Jimmie was in a panic tumbled this way and 
that. He had considered himself a radical, because he believed 
in expropriating the expropriators; but these plans for over- 
throwing the conventions and disbanding the home these left 
him aghast. And trilled into his ear by a vivid and amazing 





young thing with a soft hand upon his arm and a faint intoxi- 
cating perfume all about her ! Why was she telling these things 
to him? What did she mean? What? What?

They came to the house where she lived. It was late at 
night, and the street was deserted. It was up to Jimmie to say 
good night, but somehow he did not know how to say it. Com- 
rade Evelyn gave him her hand, and for some reason did not 
take it away again. Of course it would not have been polite 
for Jimmie to have pushed it away. So he held it, and looked 
at the shadowy form before him, and felt his knees shaking. 
"Comrade Higgins," said the brave, girlish voice, "we shall be 
friends, shall we not?" And of course, Jimmie answered that 
they would always ! And the girlish voice replied, "I am glad!" 
And then suddenly it whispered, "Good night !" and the shadowy 
form turned and flitted into the house. 

Jimmie walked away with the strangest tumult in his soul. 
It was something which the poets had been occupied for cen- 
turies in trying to portray, but Jimmie Higgins had no acquain- 
tance with the poets, and so it was a brand new thing to him, 
he was left to experience the shock of it and to resolve the 
problems of it all alone. To be rolled and tossed about like a 
man in a blanket at a college hazing ! To be a prey to bewilder- 
ment and fear, hope and longing, despair and rebellion, delicious 
excitement, angry self -contempt and tormenting doubt ! Truly 
did that poet divine who first conceived the symbol of the 
mischievous little god, who steals upon an unsuspecting man 
and shoots him through the heart with a sharp and tormenting 
arrow ! 

The worst of it was, Jimmie couldn't tell Lizzie about it. 
The first time in four years that he had had a trouble he could 
not tell Lizzie ! He even felt ashamed, as he came home and 
crawled into bed as if he had done some dreadful wrong to 
Lizzie; and yet, he would have been puzzled to tell just what 
the wrong was, or how he could have avoided it. It was not 
he who had made the young feminist so delicious and sweet and 
frank and amazing. It was not he who had made the little god, 
and brewed the poison for the arrow's tip. No, it was some 
power greater than himself that had prepared this situation, 



 

some power cruel and implacable, which plots against domestic 
tranquillity; perhaps it was some hireling of capitalism, which 
will not permit a propagandist of social justice to do his work 
in peace of soul ! 

Jimmie tried to hide what was going on; and of course 
poor, naive soul he had never learned to hide anything in his 
life, and now was too late to begin. The next time the local 
met, the women were saying that they were disappointed in 
Comrade Higgins; they had thought he was really devoted to 
the cause, but they saw now he was like all the rest of the men 
his head had been turned by one smile on a pretty face. Instead 
of attending to his work, he was following that Baskerville 
creature about, gazing at her yearningly, like a moon-calf, mak- 
ing a ninny of himself before the whole room. And he with a 
wife and three babies at home, waiting for him and thinking he 
was hustling for the cause. When the meeting adjourned, and 
the Baskerville creature accepted the invitation of Comrade 
Gerrity to escort her home, the dismay of Comrade Higgins 
was so evident as to be ludicrous to the whole room. 



In the interest of common decency it was necessary for the 
women of the local to take action on this matter. At least, a 
couple of them thought so, and quite independently and without 
prearrangement they called on Lizzie next day and told her that 
she should come more frequently to meetings, and keep herself 
acquainted with the new ideas of advanced feminism. And so 
when Jimmie came home that night, he found his wife dissolved 
in tears, and there was a most harrowing scene. 

For poor Elizabeth Huszar, pronounced Eleeza Betooser, had 
had no chance whatever to familiarise herself with the new ideas 
of advanced feminism. Her notions of "free unions" had been 
derived from a quite different world, whose ideas were not new, 
but on the contrary very, very old, and were "advanced" only 
on the road to perdition. She judged Jimmie's behaviour ac- 
cording to thoroughly old standards, and she was broken-hearted, 
overwhelmed with grief and shame. He was like all the rest 
of men and when she had fondly thought he was different! 
He despised her and spit upon her a woman he had picked up in 
a brothel. 





Poor Jimmie was stunned. He was conscious of no disre- 
spect for Lizzie, it had not occurred to him to think that she 
might take the matter that way. But so she had taken it, 
beyond doubt, and with intensity that frightened him. He 
would not have believed that so many tears could stream from 
one woman's eyes nor that his good, broad-faced, honest wife 
could be so abject in her misery. "Oh, I knowed it, I knowed 
it all along it would be that way! I hadn't never ought to 
married you you know I told you so !" 

"But, Lizzie!" pleaded the husband. "You're mistaken. 
That hadn't nothin' to do with it." 

She turned upon him wildly, her fingers stuck out as if she 
would claw him. "You mean to tell me if you hadn't 'a married 
a woman off the street, you'd 'a gone chasin' a fluffy-haired girl ? 
If you'd 'a, had a decent wife, that you knowed had some 
rights " 

"Lizzie !" he protested, in consternation. "'Listen here " 

But she was not to be stopped. "Everybody said I was a 
fool; but I went an' done it, 'cause you swore you'd never hold 
it up to me ! An' I went an' had them children" Lizzie swept 
her arm at the children, as if to wipe them off the earth, to which 
they had come by a cruel mistake. Jimmie Junior, who was 
old enough to know that something serious was happening, and 
whose instinct was all against being wiped off the earth, began
