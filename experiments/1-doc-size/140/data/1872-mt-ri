sigh of dismal impressiveness, explanatory of his business. 

He choked, and even shed tears; but with an efibrt he 
mastered his voice and said in lugubrious tones : 

" Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door ? " 
"Am I the — pardon me, I believe I do not understand?" 
With another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined : 

" Why yon see we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys 
thought maybe you would give us a lift, if we'd tackle you — 
that is, if I've got the rights of it and you are the head clerk 
of the doxology-works next door." 

'• I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is 
next door." 

" The which ? " 

" The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers 
whose sanctuary adjoins these premises." 

Scotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then 
said : 

" You ruther hold over me, pard. I reckon I can't call 
that hand. Ante and pass the buck." 

" How ? I beg pardon. "What did I understand you to 
say?" 

"Well, you've ruther got the bulge on me. Or maybe 
we've both got the bulge, somehow. You don't smoke me 
and I don't smoke you. You see, one of the boys has passed 
in his checks and we want to give him a good send-ofi", and so 
the thing I'm on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a little 
chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome." 

" My friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered. 
Your observations are wholly incomprehensible to me. Can- 
not you simplify them in some way? At first I thought 
perhaps I understood you, but I grope now. Would it not 
expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical 
statements of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumula- 
tions of metaphor and allegory ? " 

Another pause, and more reflection. Then, said Scotty : 

"I'll have to pass, I judge." 

"How?" 

"You've raised me out, pard." 

"I still fail to catch your meaning." 

" Why, that last lead of yourn is too many for me — that's 
the idea. I can't neither trump nor follow suit." 

The clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed. Scotty 
leaned his head on his hand and gave himself up to thought 
Presently his face came up, sorrowful but confident. 

" I've got it now, so's you can sawy," lie said. " What we 
want is a gospel-sharp. See ? " 

" A what ? " 

" Gospel-shai-p. Parson." 

" Oh ! Why did you not say so before ? I am a clergy- 
man — a parson." 

" Now you talk ! You see my blind and straddle it like a 
man. Put it there ! " — extending a brawny paw, which closed 
over the minister's small hand and gaA-e it a shake indicative 
of fraternal sympathy and fervent gratification. 

" Xow we're all right, pard. Let's start fresh. Don't you 
mind my snuffling a little — becuz we're in a power of trouble. 
You see, one of the boys has gone up the flume — " 

" Gone where ? " 

" Up the flume — throwed up the sponge, you understand." 

" Thrown up the sponge ? " 

" Yes — kicked the bucket — " 

" Ah — has departed to that mysterious country from whose 
oourne no traveler returns." 

"Return ! I reckon not. Why pard, he's dead! " 

" Yes, I understand." 

" Oh, you do % Well I thought maybe you might be get- 
ting tangled some more. Yes, you see he's dead again — " 

" Again  Why, has he ever been dead before ? " 

" Dead before ? No ! Do you reckon a man has got as 
many lives as a cat % But you bet you he's awful dead now, 
poor old boy, and I wish I'd never seen this day. I don't 
want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw. I knowed him by 
the back ; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to 
him — you hear me. Take him all round, pard, there never 
was a bullier man in the mines. No man ever knowed Buck 
Fanshaw to go back on a friend. But it's all up, you know, 
it's all up. It ain't no use. They've scooped him." 

" Scooped him ? " 

"Yes — death has. Well, well, well, we've got to give him 
up. Yes indeed. It's a kind of a hard world, after all, ain't 
it ? But pard, he was a rustler ! You ought to seen him get 
started once. He was a bully boy with a glass eye ! Just spit 



in his face and give him room according tp his strength, and 
it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in. He was the 
worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath. Pard, he was 
on it ! He was on it bigger than an Injun ! " 

" On it ? On what ? " 

" On the shoot. On the shoulder. On the iight, you un- 
derstand. He didn't give a continental for anybody. Beg your 
pardon, friend, for coming so near saying a cuss-word — but you 
see I'm on an awful strain, in this palaver, on account of hav- 
ing to cramp down and draw everything so mild. But we've 
got to give him up. There ain't any getting around that, I 
don't reckon. Now if we can get you to help plant him — " 

" Preach the funeral discourse ? Assist at the obsequies ? ' 

" Obs'quies is good. Yes. That's it — that's our little 
game. We are going to get the thing up regardless, you
