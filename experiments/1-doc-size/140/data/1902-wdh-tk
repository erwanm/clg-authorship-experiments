you can put him off, somehow." 

"Yes," Kenton returned, doubtfully. "Don t," 
he added, " be too blunt with Ellen. You know she 
didn 't say anything explicit to me." 

"I think I will know how to manage, Mr. Ken- 
ton." 

" Yes, of course, Sarah. I 'm not saying that." 
Breckon did not apparently try to find the judge 
before lunch, and at table he did not seem especially 
devoted to Ellen in her father 's jealous eyes. He 
joked Lottie, and exchanged those passages of repar 
tee with her in which she did not mind using a 
bludgeon when she had not a rapier at hand; it 
is doubtful if she was very sensible of the differ 
ence. Ellen sat by in passive content, smiling now 
and then, and Boyne carried on a dignified conver 
sation with Mr. Pogis, whom he had asked to lunch 
at his table, and who listened with one ear to 
the vigorous retorts of Lottie in her combat with 
Breckon. 

The judge witnessed it all with a grave dis 
pleasure, more and more painfully apparent to his 
wife. She could see the impatience, the gathering 
misgiving, in his face, and she perceived that she 
must not let this come to conscious dissatisfaction 
with Breckon; she knew her husband capable of 
indignation with trifling which would complicate 
the situation, if it came to that. She decided to 



 

speak with Ellen as soon as possible, and she meant 
to follow her to her state-room when they left the 
table. But fate assorted the pieces in the game 
differently. Boyne walked over to the place where 
Miss Rasmith was sitting with her mother; Lottie 
and Mr. Pogis went off to practise duets together, 
terrible, four - handed torments under which the 
piano presently clamored; and Ellen stood for a 
moment talked to by Mr. Breckon, who challenged 
her then for a walk on deck, and with whom she 
went away smiling. 

Mrs. Kenton appealed with the reflection of the 
girl 's happiness in her face to the frowning censure 
in her husband s; but Kenton spoke first. "What 
does he mean?" he demanded, darkly. "If he is 
making a fool of her he 'll find that that game 
can 't be played twice, with impunity. Sarah, I be 
lieve I should choke him." 

"Mr. Kenton!" she gasped, and she trembled in 
fear of him, even while she kept herself with diffi 
culty from shaking him for his folly. "Don 't say 
such a thing! Can 't you see that they want to 
talk it over? If he hasn 't spoken to you it 's be 
cause he wants to know how you took what she 
said." Seeing the effect of these arguments, she 
pursued: "Will you never have any sense? I will 
speak to Ellen the very minute I get her alone, 
and you have just got to wait. Don 't you suppose 
it 's hard for me, too? Have I got nothing to 
bear?" 

Kenton went silently back to his book, which he 



 

took with him to the reading-room, where from time 
to time his wife came to him and reported that Ellen 
and Breckon were still walking up and down to 
gether, or that they were sitting down talking, or 
were forward, looking over at the prow, or were 
watching the deck-passengers dancing. Her hus 
band received her successive advices with relaxing 
interest, and when she had brought the last she 
was aware that the affair was entirely in her hands 
with all the responsibility. After the gay parting 
between Ellen and Breckon, which took place late 
in the afternoon, she suffered an interval to elapse 
before she followed the girl down to her state-room. 
She found her lying in her berth, with shining 
eyes and glad, red cheeks; she was smiling to her 
self. 

" That is right, Ellen," her mother said. " You 
need rest after your long tramp." 

"I 'm not tired. We were sitting down a good 
deal. I didn 't think how late it was. I 'm ever so 
much better. Where 's Lottie?" 

" Off somewhere with that young Englishman," 
said Mrs. Kenton, as if that were of no sort of 
consequence. "Ellen," she added, abruptly, trying 
within a tremulous smile to hide her eagerness, 
"what is this that Mr. Breckon wants to talk with 
your father about?" 

" Mr. Breckon ? With poppa ?" 

" Yes, certainly. You told him this morning that 
Mr. Breckon" 

"Oh! Oh yes!" said Ellen, as if recollecting 




something that had slipped her mind. " He wants 
poppa to advise him whether to go back to his con 
gregation in New York or not." 

Mrs. Kenton sat in the corner of the sofa next 
the door, looking into the girl 's face on the pillow 
as she lay with her arms under her head. Tears of 
defeat and shame came into her eyes, and she 
could not see the girl 's light nonchalance in adding : 
" But he hasn 't got up his courage yet. He thinks 
he 'll ask him after dinner. He says he doesn 't 
want poppa to think he 's posing. I don 't know 
what he means." 

Mrs. Kenton did not speak at once. Her bitter 
est mortification was not for herself, but for the 
simple and tender father-soul which had been so 
tried already. She did not know how he would 
bear it, the disappointment, and the cruel hurt to 
his pride. But she wanted to fall on her knees in 
thankfulness that he had betrayed himself only to 
her.
