dedicated to Vesta. It was circular, it was roofed with old 
tiles, it was surrounded by white columns and it was consider- 
ably dilapidated. George Dallow had taken an interest in it 
(it reminded him not in the least of Rome, but of other things 
that he liked), and had amused himself with restoring it. 





"Give me your hand; sit there, and I'll ferry you, ' Nick 
Dormer said. 

Mrs. Dallow complied, placing herself opposite to him in 
the boat ; but as lie took up the paddles she declared that she 
preferred to remain on the water there was too much malice 
prepense in the temple. He asked her what she meant by 
that, and she said it was ridiculous to withdraw to an island 
a few feet square on purpose to meditate. She had nothing 
to meditate about which required so much attitude. 

" On the contrary, it would be just to change the pose. It's 
what we have been doing for a week that's attitude ; and to 
be for half an hour where nobody's looking and one hasn't to 
keep it up is just what I wanted to put in an idle, irresponsible 
day for. I am not keeping it up now I suppose you've 
noticed," Nick went on, as they floated and he scarcely dipped 
the oars. 

" I don't understand you," said Mrs. Dallow, leaning back 
in the boat. 

Nick gave no further explanation than to ask in a minute : 
" Have you people to dinner to-night? " 

" I believe there are three or four, but I'll put them off if 
you like." 

" Must you always live in public, Julia? " Nick continued. 

She looked at him a moment, and he could see that she 
coloured slightly. " We'll go home I'll put them off." 

" Ah no, don't go home ; it's too jolly here. Let them 
come let them come, poor wretches ! " 

" How little you know me, when, ever so many times, I 
have lived here for months without a creature." 

"Except Mrs. Gresham, I suppose." 

" I have had to have the house going, I admit." 

"You are perfect, you are admirable, and I don't criticize 

you." 

" I don't understand you ! " she tossed back. 

" That only adds to the generosity of what you have done 
for me," Nick returned, beginning to pull faster. He bent 
over the oars and sent the boat forward, keeping this up for 
ten minutes, during which they both remained silent. His 
companion, in her place, motionless, reclining (the seat in the 
stern was very comfortable), looked only at the water, the 
sky, the trees. At last Nick headed for the little temple, 
saying first however : " Sha'n't we visit the ruin? " 

" If you like. I don't mind seeing how they keep it." 

They reached the white steps which led up to it. Nick 





held the boat and Mrs. Dallow got out. He fastened the boat 
and they went up the steps together, passing through the open 
door. 

" They keep it very well," Nick said, looking round. " It's 
a capital place to give up everything." 

" It might do for you to explain what you mean," said Julia, 
sitting down. 

" I mean to pretend for half an hour that I don't represent 
the burgesses of Harsh. It's charming it's very delicate 
work. Surely it has been retouched." 

The interior of the pavilion, lighted by windows which the 
circle of columns was supposed, outside and at a distance, to 
conceal, had a vaulted ceiling and was occupied by a few 
pieces of last-century furniture, spare and faded, of which the 
colours matched with the decoration of the walls. These and 
the ceiling, tinted and not exempt from indications of damp, 
were covered with fine mouldings and medallions. It was a 
very elegant little tea-house. 

Mrs. Dallow sat on the edge of a sofa, rolling her parasol 
and remarking : " You ought to read Mr. Hoppus's article 
to me." 

"Why, is this your salon  ?" asked Nick, smiling. 

"Why are you always talking of that? It's an invention 
of your own." 

" But isn't it the idea you care most about ? " 

Suddenly, nervously, Mrs. Dallow put up her parasol and 
sat under it, as if she were not quite sensible of what she 
was doing. " How much you know me ! I don't care about 
anything that you will ever guess." 

Nick Dormer wandered about the room, looking at various 
things it contained the odd volumes on the tables, the bits of 
quaint china on the shelves. " They keep it very well ; you've 
got charming things." 

" They're supposed to come over every day and look after 
them." 

"They must come over in force." 

" Oh, no one knows." 

" It's spick and span. How well you have everything 
done ! " 

" I think you've some reason to say so," said Mrs. Dallow. 
Her parasol was down and she was again rolling it tight. 

" But you're right about my not knowing you. Why were 
you so ready to do so much for me  ? " 

He stopped in front of her and she looked up at him. Her
