the house of her stepson, and all her garden truck, 
so she considered herself quite an independent 
woman. She was very fond of neighborly affairs. 

“ I declare Tm real tuckered out,” and she 
dropped into the big rocking-chair. “ I do be- 
lieve I ain’t as young as I was ten year ago,” with 
a little cackle. “ But I did want to know the 
rights of the story, so I could set folks straight. 
People do get things so mixed up. Was there 
some one who took your Chan down to New 
York to have an operation, and is he going to 
lose his leg?” 

Oh, no,” returned Rilla impatiently. 




“ Well, I said I knew you’d never be willin’. 
He might better be a little lame than to have only 
one leg. An’ who’s this man that took him down, 
any relation ? ” 

It’s a gentleman who lives at Grafton. He 
took a great fancy to Chan, and wanted to see 
if something couldn’t be done for him. Dr. Breen 
advised it in the spring, but mother didn’t see her 
way clear.” 

I heard she got some money from that old 
lady after all, and a great bundle of truck.” 

Yes,” said Rilla briefly. 

“ ’Nough to pay all expenses?” 

We don’t know what they will be, and mother 
will pay as she can,” evasively. Mr. Mann is 
to take charge.” 

‘‘ Now can you be sure he’s honest? Men do 
cheat so nowadays; and as for the truth they 
don’t tell it half the time, nor t’other half either. 
Don’t you think it’s a great risk ? Did your 
mother go down and see the place an’ the doctors ? 
Don’t you know ’bout Mirny Fisk, who went down 
to see about her eye? Oh, no, ’twas afore your 
time. I don’t believe you were born then. She 
was husband’s niece, and she went down to the 
city and paid away fifty good dollars, an’ it didn’t 
do a mite of good. When she come home she 





couldn’t see a mite out of that eye, not even with 
specs. I don’t put much faith in doctors. Do 
you really think his leg will have to come off? 
An’ he so young, too! ’Pears to me I’d about 
as leave he’d die. We’ve all got to die some 
time.” 

Rilla wiped away a tear. There is no likeli- 
hood of his losing his leg, I believe,” she said 
firmly. 

Well, you can’t ’most always tell. Queer 
things happen in most unexpected places. I 
wouldn’t be too confident. Is his board going to 
be paid, or is it one of them charity places?” 

No, he is a paid patient, in a beautiful 
place.” 

Then you mark my words. When their board 
is paid they go on keeping ’em, and when it 
isn’t, they shove ’em out mighty quick. You can’t 
depend upon any one in this deceitful world and 
vale of sorrows. Any of the children had measles 
or whooping-cough ? ” 

“ They’ve all had the whooping-cough.” 

Well, I declare to man! How did your 
mother stand it? I should o’ thought she’d gone 
crazy. An’ it’s a wonder she didn’t take it. Peo- 
ple can have it twice I’ve heerd. Now, in old 
times you had it once for all and was done with 


 

it. But times change so much you never know 
just where you stand. Got plenty of grapes, 
Rilla?’' 

Yes. Will you have some? ” thinking to dis- 
miss her guest. 

I don’t mind if I do. Dave’s wife cut so 
many off for green grape jell that we ain’t hardly 
any ripe ones. Yes, I’ll take some.” Amaryllis 
did them up in a paper bag and handed them to 
her. 

Now, when’ll you be likely to hear about 
Chan? I’ll feel reel anxious. For you know 
there’s that blood poisonin’ that sets in with so 
many things, and lockjaw from just a little scratch 
with a rusty nail. It’s strange how many things 
there are to take people out of the world, an’ after 
all we don’t know much about the next one.” 

” We are not certain when we’ll hear.” 

Well, I’ll stop in again. I always feel sym- 
pathy for them in trouble, the Bible commands you 
to. Much obleeged for the grapes. Oh, Rilla, has 
your mother made any risin’ lately? Dave’s wife 
alwers gets it sour, and her bread is enough to 
turn one blue-mouldy. Your mother’s is alwers so 
good.” 

Sometimes Rilla gave the poor old woman a 
loaf, but now she went to the closet and merely 




broke off a piece of the “ risin’.” Granny stood 
uncertain. 

You’ll likely hear the last of the week? ” 

“ Yes — perhaps,” indifferently. 

“ I sh’d want to hear every day by that telegraft 
or the other thing. Strange now, ain’t it, that you
