such people in the world. It is one of the puzzling 
things.” 

True. At eighteen we cannot solve all the mysteries. 


CHAPTER V. 



The wedding had been on Wednesday. On Saturday 
I received a letter from a friend in New Haven. Georgie 
Curtis had graduated in the same class as I. Her parents 
had removed the April previous ; and Georgie had gone 
on, boarding, until the close of school. She had visited 
at our house a good deal that spring, and we had kept up 
a correspondence. She had asked me to spend part of 
my vacation with her ; but the matter stood in that un- 
certain way. Now she appointed a day, the following 
Thursday, and wanted to keep me two or thi’ee weeks, 
if I could stay. 

We had been sewing very industriously thus far. With 
Theo and I in school, many matters had to be left fotr 
vacation. Theo was so dainty and tasty. She could 
trim hats equal to a milliner, and had such splendid ideas 
on the subject of furbishing up old dresses ! Mother was 
very “handy,” as Medford people used to say; so that 
we seldom hired any sewing done. And now I felt quite 
in order. 

“Capital!” said Archie when he heard of it. “My 
vacation begins on Wednesday, and I am going up to 
Maine. I’ll take you, and spend one night at New 
Haven.” 

So that was settled. 

James Miller came on Sunday evening, and we went to 



church. Then, with Theo, we walked up the street in 
the beautiful moonlight. 

“ There’s to be a splendid excursion on Wednesday, to 
Rockaway Beach,” said he suddenly. “ I should so like 
to take you two girls ! Couldn’t you go ? There will be 
a barge for dancing, and a real nice company.” 

“ I am going away on Thursday,” I said, glad that it 
was so. “I am much obliged ; but I shall be too much 
engaged to leave home on that day.” 

“Going away! Where?” The surprise and blank- 
ness of his tone kept it from being rude. 

“ To New Haven. To spend a fortnight.” 

“ Oh, I’m so sorry ! ” 

“ But I shall have a nice time,” in a gay tone. 

“ I dare say. Yet I wish you were not going. It is 
selfish, isn’t it? You won’t stay more than a fortnight? ” 

“ I am not quite sure,” rather dubiously. 

What was this strange feeling about James Miller? 
Other young men had taken me to church, lectures, parties, 
though as yet I had had no regular lover. I knew by a 
species of womanly intuition that he was caring about me 
in a different way, and I felt worried. Martha’s marriage 
had annoyed me all through, from the lack of delicacy 
and romance. Yet how many business-like, common- 
place marriages there were in the world ! How many 
girls would be glad of an opportunity to unite their des- 
tinies with the Miller family ! I knew I could have this 
chance. Should I thrust it one side before it took definite 
shape? James was better-looking than Stephen. He 
had a pleasant ideal of a home, and a woman would be 
very comfortable in it ; and be loved in his good, rough, 
hearty fashion. 

I was glad to find mother and Archie in the parlor on 
our return. There was no chance for a tete-a-tete. But, 
when he was going away, I went out to the hall-door. 

“ I’m 80 sorry to have you go just now ! I had planned 





SO many nice things ! And you may count on one friend 
who will be glad to get you back. Good-by till then.” 

He stooped suddenly, and, before I could prevent, had 
kissed me. I bit my lip with pain and anger. I did not 
like being taken possession of, whether I would or not. 
Unless he was to be my lover, he had no right, and none 
anyhow, until I gave it. Yet I could not quite decide the 
matter. Perhaps no young girl can at once dismiss a 
man’s regard from her mind, unless there is something 
positively distasteful in it. This only had the crime of 
being intensely common-place. 

Archie and I reached New Haven safely ; and Miss 
Georgie came to escort us home, — a pretty bowery nest 
a little in the suburbs, with a great roomy porch, and 
lovely flower-garden. Mrs. Curtis was sweet and cordial. 
She had been a widow ; and her daughter by her first 
marriage, Mrs. Danforth, was Imng at home, with her 
two babies, perfect cherubs. Mr. Danforth was a profess- 
or of chemistry, a fine-looking, scholarly man, of whom I 
felt a little afraid at first. Georgie had two younger 
brothers. 

Archie said good-by, and was off. We settled ourselves 
to a most dehghtful course of visiting. There were rides 
and walks, and going to the salt water, beside a three- 
days’ excursion in a yacht. Then there was a visit to 
be made in the country at grandmother’s ; and altogether 
I spent three charming weeks. 

I came to hke Mr. Danforth so much ! He was the 
embodiment of refinement and manliness, the most de- 
voted of husbands, the tenderest of fathers, with a large, 
generous mind, and the charm of being very entertaining. 
He did not unbend simply because you were a young girl ; 
rather he seemed to reach out his hand and draw you up 
to his level. I think now that it unwittingly tinctured all 
my life to meet this man, who gave me a larger insight 
into what men might be. If Heaven had in store for me 
any such, how patient! v T would wait !
