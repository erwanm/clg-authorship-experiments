time ? ’ ’ 

“ Quite as well,” I answer. 

“ To-morrow then, at three, say. Tell her not to be 
worried. Give her my truest, warmest sjunpathy. Why, 
she can be nothing but a child.” 

“ Nineteen this very month.” 

“ And in one year she has run through the octave of a 
woman’s life. How sad ! She was so bright and winsome, 
and with a piquant beauty. Why should this have come 
upon her? ” 

We have walked round the park, and up again. I see a 
car, and signal it. 

“ To-morrow', remember,” he says, and puts me in 
with a kind “ good-night.” 





It is late when I reach home. The> are just sitting 
down to supper. 

“O father! Mr. Hatfield was here to-day,” says 
mother, in the midst of pouring tea. “ They want a man 
in the store, chiefly to take orders and deliver goods ; and 
he wondered if you would accept of it. They pay only 
nine dollars a week.” 

“ Yes, with thanks,” replies father, — “ until something 
better comes to hand. I’ll go down immediately after 
supper, and make a bargain. It will keep me a good deal 
in the air, which is what I need.” 

Dell and mother wash up the dishes. Mrs. Palmer is 
to give her five dollars a week now. And, if father should 
earn a little, it would relieve us all greatly. 

At eight a carriage stops, and there is a quick, authori- 
tative ring at the door. Theo trembles and turns pale, 
then rouses and enters the parlor, still holding my hand. 

It is Mr. Ross. He kisses her : he always does when 
he comes. But there is a look about him to-night which 
is not to be trifled with. Indeed, he is not long in coming 
to the point. Will Theo make herself ready and go with 
him ? Before God he promises to be kindness, tenderness 
itself ; but he cannot live without her. He will not, since 
she is his lawful wife. 

Theo steadies her voice ; but I know every weak pulse 
is throbbing to its uttermost. In a soft, tremulous tone 
she tells him what she has resolved. She will remain at 
home another month. 

He pleads persuasively at first. The man has a won- 
derfully pathetic voice. He pictures his lonehness in a 
manner that would make your heart ache. 

She is not sufficiently well for any change, she replies. 
And she has not quite decided. 

He loses temper and patience presently. 

“Madam!” he cries in a transport of fury, his face 
livid, his eyes two points of flame — “Madam, do you 


 


know that y'ou are my wife, that the law gives me a right 
to you, soul and body? I have a carriage and an officer 
outside, a warrant in pocket. Either you go peace- 
ably or by force. This fooling is at an end.” 

Then Theo rises. She is so slim, so willowy and sway- 
ing, that it seems as if she must fall. Her face is color- 
less ; even the lips look marble cold ; while her hair and 
eyes are full of shadowy dusk. She stretches out her 
little hand. 

“Alex,” she says calmty, “touch me at your peril. 
Do you want to kill me ? ’ ’ 

“ I had rather hold you dead in my arms than to know 
you were alive in those of aiiy other, man or woman.” 

Can human jealousy go farther? 

He comes a step nearer. A dozen thoughts flash 
through my mind ; and yet I stand terror-stricken. 

“You shall not kill me : you have no right. I have not 
sinned against you. Oh, how cruel you are ! And now 
I tell you I will not go to-night, perhaps never.” 

She retreats a few steps. Mother has thought, and de- 
spatched Dick for our good neighbor Mr. Mercer. He runs 
in through the garden-way, and enters the dining-room. 
At that instant Theo falls senseless in mother’s arms. 

“ You have killed her ! ” shrieks maimna. 

But Theo recovers, and Mr. Mercer talks. Mr. Ross 
turns sulkity. He is not a profane man ; but he utters an 
oath, — one of those deep, sullen oaths, with a grinding of 
the teeth. Then he leaves us, and the carriage rolls away. 

I comfort them all with the news of Mr. Sargent’s pro- 
posed visit. 

Father obtains the situation. The next day a letter 
comes from Archie, enclosing fifty dollars that he has 
saved for mother. Did we ever dream that fifty dollars 
would make us so joyful? My poor little watch can be 
saved to me a while longer. 

By the next night we feel like a different family. Mr. 





Sargent has called. He is very sure, by advertising or 
some method, he can find this man at Pittsburg. It is 
best that Mr. Ross shall be forbidden the house : this, 
Mr. Sargent attends to also. 

One of those sleepless nights, I confess to Theo my 
bit of heart-history. It brings us nearer, each to have 
had a sorrow. 

“O Chris!” she exclaims passionately, “in the early 
days, when you had first given him up, did you not long
