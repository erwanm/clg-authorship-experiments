then ; at least, we women do. Men think they 
do, but it is only a sort of theory. They want a 
lounging-place, where they can read their paper 
and doze in a way they would be ashamed to at 
a club." 

" And if Mr. Palmer enjoyed going out where 
it was bright and lively ! But he doesn't dance, 
and he really isn't fond of society, except where 
there are men to talk about town improvements 
and what the legislature is doing, and Congress 
and all that ; " and Bessie's pretty face gloomed 
over. 

" There are men who ought never to marry. 
I don't mean anything derogatory to the men, my 



dear; understand that; but they never trouble 
themselves to understand woman, to study her in 
every way. If they support her, they think their 
duty done. I don't see why such men want to 
marry. It is a great mistake, a great injury to the 
woman who might have done something more 
satisfactory." 

" Yes," returned Bessie, feeling herself a deeply 
injured woman. If Roy had not offered to marry 
her, she was sure, now, she should have gone to 
the- city and found something to do. 

No matter on what subject they began, the talk 
always drifted round to this. Mrs. Lowndes knew 
she was fanning Mrs. Palmer's discontent with 
her life, but she salved her conscience with the 
fact that it was an unwise marriage, and it would 
be an untruth to deny it. So many people mar 
ried unfortunately. Perhaps in the new order of 
things women would be wiser ; would realize that 
their lives were given for some purpose, not 
merely to be wrested from its rightful longings by 
man's power over them. 

She had heard some such talk last summer, 
Bessie thought. She was not sufficiently critical, 
nor had she the breadth of mind, to discriminate 
between Mrs. Lowndes' liberty for a married 
woman, and a single woman's right to refuse mar 
riage if she chose. She wanted to be free and 




prosperous enough to do as she liked. But Mrs. 
Lowndes was quite too wary to counsel a separa 
tion. 

At the last moment Violet Fair found she could 
not come. " Don't, pray, induce any one to leave 
a good home for the uncertainties of the stage," 
she wrote. " There are hosts of stage-struck girls 
now who are on the verge of starvation." 

Mrs. Lowndes did not repeat this good advice. 
There was no use in paining the poor child when 
she might never see her again. She parted from 
her with a great deal of tenderness and half won 
dered how it would do to propose to Mr. Palmer 
that his wife should accompany her on some 
autumnal tour. But a very tempting invitation 
came to her that settled the matter. 

Other people were leaving Westhorpe as well. 
The chief hotels closed for the winter. The park, 
the lawns, and the promenades began to wear a 
deserted aspect. Roy understood this, and de 
voted more time to Bessie, taking her out on his 
business drives. 

" But it is so cold and stupid to sit there alone 
while you are talking," she said, with extreme dis 
satisfaction. "I believe I would rather stay at 
home." 

And as it grew colder in the autumn he ceased 
to ask her. She drove by herself, and now and 



then found a friend to take out. Then she played 
and sang and danced for amusement. She acted 
parts of plays that she recalled, or improvised 
them to suit herself. But it was the crowd and 
the admiration she wanted, that she had a secret 
consciousness she could win. 

Just before the holidays, business matters took 
Palmer to the city. Bessie could have danced 
with delight. 

"We have never taken a real wedding journey," 
he said, pleased at her happiness. He had begun 
to "realize that the life was much worse for her 
than for him. " We will have a gay time, and you 
shall go to the theatre as often as you like." 

Three months ago she would have clasped her 
arms around his neck and indulged in endearing 
epithets, if they had no real meaning. Now she 
had a touch of dignity that rather amused him, 
as she said in a pointed tone : " A year and more 
seems a long while to wait for such an event. 
Still, I am glad to have it even now." 

" Bessie, you know all the reasons. It has been 
hard and dull for you, but another summer I shall 
be more at liberty. And you could have gone to 
Niagara." 

" Oh, with those stupid Bowens ! And I don't 
really care for Niagara. I want to go where 
there are hosts of people and one has a good time. 




And I shall find some old friends in New York, 
I know. It seems an age since I came here ; a 
long, dull, wretched age ! " 

He kissed her, but made no further argument. 
It seemed to him that there were women with 
whom he might plead for love, but Bessie was 
only a sweet, wilful, undeveloped child. What 
power could rouse her ? Did he really love her, 
or was he only trying ? Oh, he had not reached 
the divine inspiration. 

She was quite her joyous, eager self on the
