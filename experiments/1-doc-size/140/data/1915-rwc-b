our salient while the wind holds. But west 
winds are predicted after sunrise tomorrow. 
I'm going to get into the Nivelle belfry to 
night with a sack of bombs. I'm going to try 
to explode their gas cylinders if I can. The 









tocsin is the signal for our people in the 
salient." 

"You're crazy!" remarked one of the air 
men. 

"No; I'll bluff it out. I'm to have a Boche 
uniform in a few moments." 

"You are crazy! You know what they'll do 
to you, don't you, Jimf 

The bandaged airman laughed, but in his 
eyes there was an odd flicker like a tiny flame. 
He whistled "La Brabangonne" and glanced 
coolly about the room. 

One of the airmen said to another in a 
whisper : 

"There you are. Ever since they got his 
brother he's been figuring on landing a whole 
bunch of Huns at one clip. This is going to 
finish him, this business." 

Another said: 

"Don't try anything like that, Jim " 

"Sure, I'll try it," interrupted the bandaged 
airman pleasantly. "When are you fellows 
going?" 

"Now." 





 



"All right. Take my report. Wait a mo 
ment 

"For God's sake, Jim, act sensibly!" 

The bandaged airman laughed, fished out 
from his clothing somewhere a note book and 
pencil. One of the others turned an electric 
torch on the table; the bandaged man made 
a little sketch, wrote a few lines which the 
others studied. 

"You can get that note to headquarters in 
half an hour, can't you, Ed?" 

"Yes." 

"All right. I'll wait here for my answer." 

"You know what risk you run, Jim?" 
pleaded the youngest of the airmen. 

"Oh, certainly. All right, then. You'd bet 
ter be on your way." 

After they had left the room, the bandaged 
airman sat beside the table, thinking hard in 
the darkness. 

Presently from somewhere across the dusky 
river meadow the sudden roar of an airplane 
engine shattered the silence; then another 
whirring racket broke out; then another. 

He heard presently the loud rattle of his 





comrades machines from high above him in 
the star-set sky; he heard the stertorous 
breathing of the old innkeeper ; he heard again 
the crystalline bell-notes break out aloft, lin 
ger in linked harmonies, die away; he heard 
Bayard's mellow thunder proclaim the hour 
once more. 

There was a watch on his wrist, but it had 
been put out of business when his machine 
fell in Nivelle woods. Glancing at it mechan 
ically he saw the phosphorescent dial glimmer 
faintly under shattered hands that remained 
fixed. 

An hour later Bayard shook the starlit 
silence ten times. 

As the last stroke boomed majestically 
through the darkness an automobile came rac 
ing into the long, unlighted street of Sainte 
Lesse and halted, panting, at the door of the 
White Doe Inn. 

The airman went out to the doorstep, sa 
luted the staff captain who leaned forward 
from the tonneau and turned a flash on him. 
Then, satisfied, the officer lifted a bundle from 





 



the tonneau and handed it to the airman. A 
letter was pinned to the bundle. 

After the airman had read the letter twice, 
the staff captain leaned a trifle nearer.
