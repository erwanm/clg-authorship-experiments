The Ldmmergeyer was a speck in the sky, 
poised over France. 

Up out of the infinite and sunlit chasm 
came a mocking, joyous hail up through the 
sheer, misty gulf out of vernal depths: 
Cuck-oo I Cuck-oo I Cuck-oo I 



CHAPTER IV 

EECONNAISSANCE 

And that was the way Carfax ended a 
tiny tragedy of incompetence compared to the 
mountainous official fiasco at Gallipoli. Here, 
a few perished among the filthy salamanders 
in the snow; there, thousands died in the 
burning Turkish gorse 

But that's history; and its makers are 
already officially damned. 

But now concerning two others of the fed- 
up dozen on board the mule transport 
Harry Stent and Jim Brown. Destiny linked 
arms with them; Fate jerked a mysterious 
thumb over her shoulder toward Italy. 
Chance detailed them for special duty as 
soon as they landed. 

It was a magnificent sight, the disembarking of the British overseas military force 
sent secretly into Italy. 

They continued to disembark and entrain 
at night. Nobody knew that British troops 
were in Italy. 

The infernal uproar along the Isonzo never 
ceased; the din of the guns resounded through 
the Trentino, but British and Canadian noses 
were sniffing at something beyond the Carnic 
Alps, along the slopes of which they continued to concentrate, Rules, Kilties, and 
Gunners. 

There seemed to be no particular hurry. 
Details from the Canadian contingent were 
constantly sent out to familiarize themselves 
with the vast waste of tunneled mountains 
denting the Austrian sky-line to the northward; and all day long Dominion reconnoitering parties wandered among valleys, alms, 
forest, and peaks in company sometimes with 
Italian alpinists, sometimes by themselves, 
prying, poking, snooping about with all the 
emotionless pertinacity of Teuton tourists 
preoccupied with wanderlust, kultur, and 
ewigkett. 









And one lovely September morning the 
British Military Observer with the Italian 
army, and his very British aid, sat on a 
sunny rock on the Col de la Eeine and 
watched a Canadian northward reconnais 
sance nothing much to see, except a solitary 
moving figure here and there on the mountains, crawling like a deerstalker across 
ledges and stretches of bracken a few dots 
on the higher slopes, visible for a moment, 
then again invisible, then glimpsed against 
some lower snow patch, and gone again beyond the range of powerful glasses. 

"The Athabasca regiment, 13th Battalion," 
remarked the British Military Observer; 
"lively and rather noisy." 

"Really," observed his A. D. C. 

"Sturdy, half-disciplined beggars," continued the B. M. 0., watching the mountain 
plank through his glasses; "every variety of 
adventurer in their ranks cattlemen, ranch 
men, Hudson Bay trappers, North West police, lumbermen, mail carriers, bear hunters, 
Indians, renegade frontiersmen, soldiers of 
fortune a sweet lot, Algy." 









"Ow." 

" And half of em unruly Yankees the 
most objectionable half, you know." 

"A bad lot," remarked the Honorable Algy. 

"Not at all," said the B. M. 0. compla 
cently; "I've a relative of sorts with em 
leftenant, I believe a Yankee brother-in-law, in point of fact." 

"Ow." 

"Married a step-sister in the States. Must 
look him up some day," concluded the B. M. 
0., adjusting his field glasses and focussing 
them on two dark dots moving across a distant waste of alpine roses along the edge 
of a chasm. 

One of the dots happened to be the "relative of sorts" just mentioned; but the 
B. M. 0. could not know that. And a moment afterward the dots became invisible 
against the vast mass of the mountain, and 
did not again reappear within the field of 
the English officer's limited vision. So he 
never knew he had seen his relative of sorts. 

Up there on the alp, one of the dots, which 
at near view appeared to be a good-looking, 






bronzed young man in khaki, puttees, and 
mountain shoes, said to the other officer who 
was scrambling over the rocks beside him: 

"Did you ever see a better country for 
sheep?"
