Suddenly the truth flashed upon her, — the crude 
truth lacking definite detail, lacking circumstance and 
colour and atmosphere, — merely the raw and ugly 
truth. 

Had he looked at her — and he did, once — he could 
have seen only the unruffled and very sweet profile of a 
young girl. Composure was one of the masks she had 
learned to wear — when she chose. 





 

And she was thinking very hard all the while; 
" So this is the man? I might have known his name. 
Where were my five wits ? Siward ! — Stephen Siward ! 
. . . He is very young, too . . . much too young to be 
so horrid. . . . Yet — it wasn't so dreadful, after all; 
only the publicity ! Dear me ! I knew we were going too 
fast." 

" Miss Landis," he said. 

" iVIr. Siward.'' " — ver- gently. It was her way to 
be gentle when generous. 

" I think," he said, " that you are beginning to remember where you may have heard my name." 

" Yes — a little — " She looked at him with the direct 
gaze of a child, but the lovely eyes were troubled. His 
smile was not very genuine, but he met her gaze steadily 
enough. 

" It was rather nice of Mrs. Ferrall to ask me," he 
said, " after the mess I made of things last spring." 

" Grace Ferrall is a dear," she replied. 

After a moment he ventured : " I suppose you saw 
it in the papers." 

" I think so ; I had completely forgotten it ; your 
name seemed to " 

" I see." Then, listlessly : " I couldn't have ven- 
tured to remind you that — that perhaps you might not 
care to be so amiable " 

" Mr. Siward," she said impulsively, " you are nice 
to me! Why shouldn't I be amiable? It was — it was — 
I've forgotten just how dreadfully j'ou did behave " 

" Pretty badly." 

"Very?" 

" They say so." 

'' And what is your opinion Mr. Siward ? " 

" Oh, I ought to have known better." Something 








about him reminded her of a bad small boy ; and suddenly in spite of her better sense, in spite of her instinctive caution, she found herself on the very verge of 
laughter. What was it in the man that disarmed and 
invited a confidence — scarcely justified it appeared? 
What was it now that moved her to overlook what few 
overlook — not the fault, but its publicity? Was it 
his agreeable bearing, his pleasant badinage, his amiably 
listless moments of preoccupation, his youth that appealed to her — aroused her charity, her generosity, her 
curiosity? 

And had other people continued to accept him, too? 
What would Quarrier think of his presence at Shotover? 
She began to realise that she was a little afraid of Quarrier's opinions. And his opinions were always judg- 
ments. However Grace Ferrall had thought it proper 
to ask him, and that meant social absolution. As far as 
that went she also was perfectly ready to absolve him 
if he needed it. But perhaps he didn't care! — She 
looked at him, furtively. He seemed to be tranquil 
enough in his abstraction. Trouble appeared to slide 
very easily from his broad young shoulders. Perhaps 
he was already taking much for granted in her gentleness with him. And gradually speculation became in- 
terest and interest a young girl's innocent curiosity to 
leai'n something of a man whose record it seemed almost 
impossible to reconcile with his personality. 

" I was wondering," he said looking up to encounter 
her clear eyes, " whose house that is over there? " 

" Beverly Plank's shooting-box ; Black Fells," she 
replied nodding toward the vast pile of blackish rocks 
against the sky, upon which sprawled a heavy stone 
house infested with chimneys. 

" Plank? Oh yes." 





 

He smiled to remember the battering blows rained 
upon the ramparts of society by the master of Black 
Fells. 

But the smile faded; and, glancing at him, the girl 
was surprised to see the subtle change in his face — 
the white worn look, then the old listless apathy which, 
all at once to her, hinted of something graver than preoccupation. 

" Are we near the sea.'' " he asked. 

" Very near. Onh a moment to the top of this 
hill. . . . Now look ! "' 

There lay the sea — the same grey-blue crawling 
void that had ever fascinated and repelled him — always 
wrinkled, always in flat monotonous motion, spreading 
away, away to the sad world's ends. 

" Full of menace — always," he said, unconscious 
that he had spoken aloud. 

"The sea!" 

He spoke without turning : " The sea is a relentless 
thing for a man to fight. . . . There are other tides 
more persistent than the sea, but like it — like it in its
