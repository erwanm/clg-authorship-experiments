not enough in common to make them rivals. I have 
lately been over to London for a week, going by the 
Dieppe and New-Haven route at night, and returning by 
another ; and the contrasts I speak of were impressed 
upon me anew. Every thing here in and about Paris was 
in the green and bloom of spring, and seemed to me very 
lovely ; but my first glance at an English landscape 
made it all seem pale and flat. We went up from New 
Haven to London in the morning, and feasted our eyes 
all the way. The French foliage is thin, spindling, 
sparse ; the grass is thin and light in color — in contrast. 
The English trees are massive, solid in substance and 
color ; the grass is thick, and green as emerald ; the turf 
is.like the heaviest Wilton carpet. The whole effect is 
that of vegetable luxuriance and solidity, as it were a 
tropical luxuriance, condensed and hardened by northern 
influences. If my eyes remember well, the French land- 
scapes are more like our own, in spring tone, at least ; but 
the English are a revelation to us strangers of what green 
really is, and what grass and trees can be. I had been 
told that we did well to see England before going to the 
Continent, for it would seem small and only pretty after- 
wards. Well, leaving out Switzerland, I have seen noth- 
ing in that beauty which satisfies the eye and wins the 
heart to compare with England in spring. When we 
annex it to our sprawling country, which lies out-doors 
in so many climates, it will make a charming little 
retreat for us in May and June, — a sort of garden of 
delight, whence we shall draw our May butter and our 
June roses. It will only be necessary to put it under 
glass to make it pleasant the year round. 

When we passed within the hanging smoke of London 
town, threading our way amid numberless railway tracks, 
sometimes over a road and sometimes under one, now 
burrowing into the ground, and now running along 
among the chimney-pots, — when we came into the pale 
light and the thickening industry of a London day, we 



 

could but at once contrast Paris. Unpleasant weather 
usually reduces places to an equality of disagreeableness. 
But Paris, with its wide streets, light, handsome houses, 
gay windows, and smiling little parks and fountains, 
keeps up a tolerably pleasant aspect, let the weather do 
its worst. But London, with its low, dark, smutty brick 
houses and insignificant streets, settles down hopelessly 
into the dumps when the weather is bad. Even with 
the sun doing its best on the eternal cloud of smoke, it is 
dingy and gloomy enough, and so dirty, after spic-span, 
shining Paris. And there is a contrast in the matter 
of order and system ; the lack of both in London is ap- 
parent. You detect it in public places, in crowds, in the 
streets. The " social evil " is bad enough in its demon- 
strations in Paris : it is twice as offensive in London. I 
have never seen a drunken woman in Paris : I saw many 
of them in the daytime in London. I saw men and 
women fight in the streets, — a man kick and pound a wo- 
man ; and nobody interfered. There is a brutal streak in 
the Anglo-Saxon, I fear, — a downright animal coarseness, 
that does not exhibit itself the other side of the Channel. 
It is a proverb, that the London policemen are never at 
hand. The stout fellows with their clubs look as if they 
might do service ; but what a contrast they are to the 
Paris ser gents de ville ! The latter, with his dress -coat, 
cocked hat, long rapier, white gloves, neat, polite, atten- 
tive, alert, — always with the manner of a Jesuit turned 
soldier, — you learn to very much trust, if not respect ; 
and you feel perfectly secure that he will protect you, and 
give you your rights in any corner of Paris. It does look 
as if he might slip that slender rapier through your body 
in a second, and pull it out and wipe it, and not move a 
muscle ; but I don't think he would do it unless he were 
directly ordered to. He would not be likely to knock 
you down and drag you out, in mistake for the rowdy 
who was assaulting you. 

A great contrast between the habits of the people of 
London and Paris is shown by their eating and drinking. 



 

Paris is brilliant witli cafes : all the world frequents them 
to sip coiFee (and too often absinthe), read the papers, 
and gossip over the news ; take them away, as all travel- 
lers know, and Paris would not know itself. There is not 
a cafe in London : instead of cafes, there are gin-mills ; 
instead of light wine, there is heavy beer. The restau- 
rants and restaurant life are as different as can be. You 
can get any thing you wish in Paris : you can live very 
cheaply or very dearly, as you like. The range is more 
limited in London. I do not fancy the usual run of Paris 
restaurants. You get a great deal for your money, in 
variety and quantity ; but you don't exactly know what 
it is : and in time you tire of odds and ends, which destroy 
your hunger without exactly satisfying you. For myself, 
after a pretty good run of French cookery (and it beats 
the world for making the most out of little), when I sat 
down again to what the eminently-respectable waiter in 
white and black calls " a dinner off the joint, sir," with 
what belongs to it, and ended up with an attack on a 
section of a cheese as big as a bass-drum, not to forget a 
pewter mug of amber liquid, I felt as if I had touched 
bottom again, — got something substantial, had what 
you call a square meal. The English give you the sub- 
stantials, and better, I believe, than any other people. 
Thackeray used to come over to Paris to get a good din- 
ner now and then. I have tried his favorite restaurant 
here, the cuisine of which is famous far beyond the banks 
of the Seine ; but I think if he, hearty trencher-man that 
he was, had lived in Paris, he would have gone to Lon- 
don for a dinner oftener than he came here. 

And as for a lunch, — this eating is a fascinating theme, 
— commend me to a quiet inn of England. We happened 
to be out at Kew Gardens the other afternoon. You 
ought to go to Kew, even if the Duchess of Cambridge is 
not at home. There is not such a park out of England, 
considering how beautiful the Thames is there. What 
splendid trees it has ! the horse-chestnut, now a mass of 
pink-and- white blossoms, from its broad base, which rests 



 

on the ground, to its high rounded dome ; the hawthorns, 
white and red, in full flower ; the sweeps and glades of 
living green, — turf on which you walk with a grateful 
sense of drawing life directly from the yielding, bountiful 
earth, — a green set out and heightened by flowers in 
masses of color (a great variety of rhododendrons, for 
one thing), to say nothing of magnificent greenhouses 
and outlying flower-gardens. Just beyond are Richmond 
Hill and Hampton Court, and five or six centuries of tra-
