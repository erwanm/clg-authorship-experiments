coachman now and then, I could afford to.  The item did not trouble me.
I was inconsiderate at times with personal friends.  They said, It is
his way, and bore with me.  People usually bore with me; they always
had.  I looked upon this as one of the rights of temperament, so far as
I looked upon it at all.  I do not think this indulgence had occurred
to me as other than a tribute.  It is common enough in dealing with men
of my sort.  (And alas, there are enough of my sort; I must be looked
upon rather as a type than a specimen.)  Such indulgence is a movement
of self-defence, or else of philosophy, upon the part of those who come
in contact with us.  To this view of the subject I had given no
attention.

I had lived to be almost fifty years old, and no person had ever said:
"Esmerald Thorne, you trust your attractive qualities too far.  Power
and charm do not give a man a permit to be disagreeable.  Your
temperament does not release you from the common-place human duty of
self-restraint.  A gentleman has no more right to get uncontrollably
angry than he has to get drunk.  The patience with which others receive
you is not a testimony to your strength; it is a concession to your
weakness.  You are living upon concessions like disease, or childhood,
or age."

No one had said this--surely not my wife.  I can recall an expression
of bewilderment at times upon her beautiful face, which for the moment
perplexed me.  After I had gone out, I would remember that I had been
nervous in my manner.  I do not think I had ever spoken with actual
roughness to her, until this day of which I write.  That I had been
sometimes cross enough, is undoubtedly the case.

On that November day I had been overworked.  This was no novelty, and I
offer it as no excuse.  I had been up for two nights with a dangerous
case.  I had another in the suburbs, and a consultation out of town.
There was a quarrel at the hospital, and a panic in Stock Street.  I
had seen sixty patients that day.  I had been attacked in the
"Therapeutic Quarterly" upon my famous theory of Antisepsis.  Perhaps I
may add the circumstance that my baby was teething.

This was, naturally, less important to me than to his mother, who
thought the child was ill.  I knew better, and it annoyed me that my
knowledge did not remove her apprehension.  In point of fact, he had
cried at night for a week or two, more than he ought to have done.  She
could not understand why I denied him a Dover's powder.  I needed
sleep, and could not get it.  We were both worn, and--I might fill my
chapter to the brim with the little reasons for my great error.  Let it
suffice that they were small and that it was large.

We had been married three years, and our boy was a year old.  He was a
fine fellow.  Helen lost her Greek look and took on the Madonna
expression after he was born.  Any woman who is fit to be a mother
gains that expression with her first child.  My wife was a very happy
mother.

She was sitting in the library when I came in that evening.  It was a
warm, red library, with heavy curtains and an open fire--a deep room
that absorbed colour.  I fancied the room, and it was my wife's
pleasure to await me in it with the child each evening at the earliest
hour when I might by any chance be expected home.  She possessed to the
full the terrible power of waiting which women have.  She could do
nothing when she expected me.  Although three years married, she could
not read, or write, or play when she was listening for my step.  I do
not mean that she told me this.  I found it out.  She never called my
attention to such little feminine weaknesses.  She was never over-fond.
My wife had a noble reserve.  I had never seen the hour when I felt
that her tenderness was a treasure to be lightly had, or indifferently
treated.

It should be said that the library opened from the parlours, and was at
that time separated from them by a heavy porti√®re of crimson stuff, the
doors not being drawn.  This drapery she was in the habit of folding
apart at the hours of my probable return, and as I came through the
long parlours my eyes had the first greeting of her, before my voice or
arms.  Upon this evening, as upon others, I entered by the parlour
door, and came--more quickly than usual--toward the library.  I was in
a great hurry; one of the acute attacks of the chronic condition which
besets the busy doctor.  As I crossed the length of the thick carpet,
the rooms shook beneath my tread; I burst into, rather than entered,
the library,--not seeing her, I think, or not pausing to see her, in
the accustomed manner.  When I had come to her I found that the child
was not with her, as usual.  She was sitting alone by the library table
under the drop-light, which held a shade of red lace.  She had a gown
of white wool trimmed with ermine; a costume which gave me pleasure,
and which she wore upon cool evenings, not too often for me to weary of
it.  She regarded my taste in dress as delicately and as delightedly as
she did every other wish or will of mine.

She had been trying to read; but the magazine lay closed upon her knee
below her folded hands.  Her face wore an anxious look as she turned
the fine contours of her head toward me.

"Oh," she cried, "at last!"

She moved to reach me, swiftly, murmuring something which I did not
hear, or to which I did not attend; and under the crimson curtains met
me, warm and dear and white, putting up her sweet arms.

I kissed her carelessly--would to God that I could forget it!  I kissed
her as if it did not matter much, and said:--

"Helen, I must have my dinner this instant!"

"Why, surely," she said, retreating from me with a little shock of
pained surprise, "It is all ready, Esmerald.  I will ring."

She melted from my arms.  Oh, if I had known, if I had known!  She
stirred and slipped and was gone from me, and I stood stupidly looking
at her; her figure, against the tall, full book-cases, shone mistily,
while she touched the old-fashioned bell-rope of gold cord.

"Really, I hadn't time to come home at all," I added testily.  "I am
driven to death.  I've got to go again in ten minutes.  But I supposed
you would worry if I didn't show myself.  It is a foolish waste of
time.  I don't know how I am ever going to get through.  I wish I
hadn't come."




CHAPTER IV.

She changed colour--from fair to flush, from red to white again--and
her hand upon the gold cord trembled.  I remembered it afterward,
though I was not conscious of noticing it at the time.

"You need not," she replied, in her low, controlled voice, "on my
account.  You need never come again."

"It is easier to come," I answered irritably, "than to know that you
sit here making yourself miserable because I don't."

"Have I ever fretted you about coming, Esmerald?  I did not know it."

"It would be easier if you did fret!" I cried crossly.  "I'd rather
you'd say a thing than look it.  Any man would."

Indeed, it would have been a paltry satisfaction to me just then if I
could have found her to blame.  Her blamelessness irritated my
self-complacence as the light irritates defective eyes.

"I am due at the hospital in twenty-two minutes," I went on, excitedly.
"Chirugeon is behaving like Apollyon.  If I'm not there to handle him,
