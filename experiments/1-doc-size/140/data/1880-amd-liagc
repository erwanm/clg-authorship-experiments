Zelie, who does not lower her prices any, I assure you. 
Why, I suppose if you had a mind to take up the old per- 
formance you might get fifty dollars a week." 

" Fifty dollars ! " Queenie's face was one stare of aston- 
ishment. 

" Yes. Do you know that Owen Thomas had to pay one 
hundred dollars a month for you. And I've never forgiven 
that woman for hiring you out when she had so much 
money. Well, I just want to enlarge your sphere of wis- 
dom. When Ritchie conies to talk business, you tell him 
that, what Thomas paid, I mean, and ask him fifty dollars. 
You'll end by getting thirty. Don't come for a cent less 
than that. And see here you won't care about being here 
again to-night ? " 

" No, I cannot," said Queenie, " there is so much to see 
to this evening. And, oh, I must go home. They will all 
be so worried." 

" Oh, it isn't late. Well, I was saying you offer to 





come on Monday night, and dance, and if you are a success, 
which you will be, of course, then make your bargain. 
Don't be jewed out of a fair price. There are girls dancing 
here for ten dollars a week ; well, perhaps it is as much as 
they are worth, but don't you begin any such work. And 
do not tell a soul what you mean to ask, even that clever 
little Fay. There's Ritchie." 

Madame Denzil began, suddenly, in the midst of one of 
their Canadian experiences, which Ritchie interrupted. 

"Miss Barretti," he commenced, "could I see you on 
Monday morning, here at the office, say ? I should like to 
have a talk about business." 

Queenie looked wistfully at her companion. 

" Why, child, you are old enough to make bargains for 
yourself," said Madame Denzil, laughingly. "Don't ap- 
peal to me in that frightened way. Come down and see 
Mr. Ritchie, he is not quite an ogre. Is Fay going to take 
you home ? " 

Miss Fay made her appearance at that moment. 

" Miss Barretti," she exclaimed, " I am not going np 
home. I seldom do after a matinee. But I'll put you in 
the car " 

"Why not stay down ? 

" Yes," said the manager. " Try us again to-night. If 
you like to see part of the play in one of the boxes " 

" I am much obliged, but I cannot. They would feel so 
worried at home. And I had better go," glancing around 
with shy entreaty. 

" Well. Don't let any one else spirit you away, and we 
will settle our business on Monday morning. Good-day ; 
but it is almost evening, isn't it?" with a cheerful laugh. 

" Give me your address. I want to see you to-morrow," 
whispered Madame Denzil. 

She wished them good-evening, and withdrew. How 
odd it seemed to come out to daylight. She stared around, 
in odd uncertainty. 





"It seems as if I must have been in there half the day 
and all night, and am just waking up." 

Queenie rubbed her eyes as she spoke, and as they 
turned the corner a sudden gust took them. 

"The gaslight, and all that, in the daytime. I say 
you're just splendid, you are ! Why, I wouldn't have be- 
lieved it. Half a dozen of the girls are ready to eat you up, 
without a grain of salt. It makes me laugh to see them 
go on so. I'm not jealous, though I might be about a 
lover," reflectively. " And I don't care for the mere dan- 
cing. I aspire to playing, as well. But won't there be a 
nice row to-night with Mam'selle Zelie !" 

"Why was she not here this afternoon?" 

" Oddly enough, the Saturday matinee was left out of her 
agreement, though Ritchie declares he spoke of it, but it 
isn't in the bond, and she will not come without extra pay. 
But her especial admirers are out in greater force in the 
evening. She's one of the stunning sort, and gained an 
immense reputation in some opera boufle at Paris. Here's 
your car. Good-night little chicken. You may consider 
an engagement sure, for Ritchie is struck with you." 

Queenie stepped into the car, pulled her veil over her 
face, and no one remarked her, though it seemed to her 
that every one must know that she had been dancing at the 
matinee. It was quite dark when she reached the well- 
known corner, and she ran fleetly down the street. 

The children were around the table, and each one 
uttered a cry of joy, interspersed with sundry ejaculations. 
The babies must kiss her, and Cissy gave her a rapturous 
hug. 

"Tip was going down to the theatre after supper," an- 
nounced Moppet. 

"And you've really been to Palace Garden!" exclaimed 
Tip. " Isn't the Enchanted Princess immense I " 

"Why can't I go ? " cried Pug. 



" Could you get any of us in ? Could I go ? " waa 
Moppet's eager question. 

Peggy was frying cakes. Now she spoke up. 

"Do let the poor child alone, with your worry in her 
like a badger. Take off your hat, Miss Queenie, and have 
a good cup of tay. An' wasn't it out till now, or were you 
with the young lady?" 

" Oh, I've so much to tell you that I hardly know where 
to begin. Yes, the play was beautiful; and oh, Tip, I 
danced, actually, in the fairy-ring, and was applauded, so
