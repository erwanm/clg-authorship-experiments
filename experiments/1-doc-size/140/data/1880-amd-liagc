Miss Fay made her appearance at that moment. 

" Miss Barretti," she exclaimed, " I am not going np 
home. I seldom do after a matinee. But I'll put you in 
the car " 

"Why not stay down ? 

" Yes," said the manager. " Try us again to-night. If 
you like to see part of the play in one of the boxes " 

" I am much obliged, but I cannot. They would feel so 
worried at home. And I had better go," glancing around 
with shy entreaty. 

" Well. Don't let any one else spirit you away, and we 
will settle our business on Monday morning. Good-day ; 
but it is almost evening, isn't it?" with a cheerful laugh. 

" Give me your address. I want to see you to-morrow," 
whispered Madame Denzil. 

She wished them good-evening, and withdrew. How 
odd it seemed to come out to daylight. She stared around, 
in odd uncertainty. 





"It seems as if I must have been in there half the day 
and all night, and am just waking up." 

Queenie rubbed her eyes as she spoke, and as they 
turned the corner a sudden gust took them. 

"The gaslight, and all that, in the daytime. I say 
you're just splendid, you are ! Why, I wouldn't have be- 
lieved it. Half a dozen of the girls are ready to eat you up, 
without a grain of salt. It makes me laugh to see them 
go on so. I'm not jealous, though I might be about a 
lover," reflectively. " And I don't care for the mere dan- 
cing. I aspire to playing, as well. But won't there be a 
nice row to-night with Mam'selle Zelie !" 

"Why was she not here this afternoon?" 

" Oddly enough, the Saturday matinee was left out of her 
agreement, though Ritchie declares he spoke of it, but it 
isn't in the bond, and she will not come without extra pay. 
But her especial admirers are out in greater force in the 
evening. She's one of the stunning sort, and gained an 
immense reputation in some opera boufle at Paris. Here's 
your car. Good-night little chicken. You may consider 
an engagement sure, for Ritchie is struck with you." 

Queenie stepped into the car, pulled her veil over her 
face, and no one remarked her, though it seemed to her 
that every one must know that she had been dancing at the 
matinee. It was quite dark when she reached the well- 
known corner, and she ran fleetly down the street. 

The children were around the table, and each one 
uttered a cry of joy, interspersed with sundry ejaculations. 
The babies must kiss her, and Cissy gave her a rapturous 
hug. 

"Tip was going down to the theatre after supper," an- 
nounced Moppet. 

"And you've really been to Palace Garden!" exclaimed 
Tip. " Isn't the Enchanted Princess immense I " 

"Why can't I go ? " cried Pug. 



" Could you get any of us in ? Could I go ? " waa 
Moppet's eager question. 

Peggy was frying cakes. Now she spoke up. 

"Do let the poor child alone, with your worry in her 
like a badger. Take off your hat, Miss Queenie, and have 
a good cup of tay. An' wasn't it out till now, or were you 
with the young lady?" 

" Oh, I've so much to tell you that I hardly know where 
to begin. Yes, the play was beautiful; and oh, Tip, I 
danced, actually, in the fairy-ring, and was applauded, so 
that I had to come out and dance again. I don't know, I 
felt as if I was bewitched. The lights and the music, and 
the crowd of people." 

Her eyes were glowing, and her cheeks scarlet, while her 
pretty ripe lips quivered. 

'Oh, Queenie, you're just too beautiful for anything!" 
cried Moppet, admiringly, catching her hand, and giving 
it a squeeze. 

"The holy Virgin save us!" ejaculated Peggy, turning 
a cake off the griddle on the floor. 

After a long while the story seemed to get told in de- 
tachments, with many wondering comments. 

" But what I am thinking of," said Queenie, her sweet 
face all aglow with a tender light, " is the money. I hope it 
isn't wicked to be so mercenary. Twenty dollars a week, 
and it won't be less than that; think what we can do! 
And you may have some shoes, Moppet, and there will be 
no more going without lunches, and scrimping, and we can 
pay back Peggy, and all the other bills ; and I am so happy, 
BO very, very happy ! " 

There Queenie broke down with a nervous crying fit. 
Every one of the noisy group was fain to rush and comfort 
her. 

"Get away I get away," said Peggy, authoritively. 
" Let the poor lamb drink her cup o' tay, and have a bite. 
She's dead tired out, what with all your clatter. Not a 





word now. If you're not as whist as mice sure every sowl 
of you'll go packing off up-stairs." 

That peremptory mandate restored order and quiet. 
Queenie was too excited to eat, but she glanced at them 
all and smiled, while Cissy declared that Peggy was a cross 
old thing. 

Tip had been very silent, studying Queenie with a sort 
of amazement, and thinking some new thoughts that had 
never entered his mind before; thoughts that, strangely
