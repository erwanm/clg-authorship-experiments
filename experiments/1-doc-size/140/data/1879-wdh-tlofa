and making her laugh as Staniford had never heard 
her laugh before — so freely, so heartily. 



XIII. 

The atoms that had been tending in Stamford's 
being toward a certain form suddenly arrested and 
shaped themselves anew at the vibration imparted 
by this laughter. He no longer felt himself Hicks's 
possible inferior, but vastly better in every way, 
and out of the turmoil of his feelings in regard to 
Lydia was evolved the distinct sense of having been 
trifled with. Somehow, an advantage had been 
taken of his sympathies and purposes, and his for- 
bearance had been treated with contempt. 

The conviction was neither increased nor dimin- 
ished by the events of the evening, when Lydia 
brought out some music from her state-room, and 
Hicks appeared, flute in hand, from his, and they 
.began practicing one of the pieces together. It was 
a pretty enough sight. Hicks had been gradually 
growing a better-looking fellow ; he had an unde- 
niable picturesqueness, as he bowed his head over 
the music towards hers ; and she, as she held the 
sheet with one hand for him to see, while she noise- 
lessly accompanied herself on the table with the 
fingers of the other, and tentatively sang now this 
passage and now that, was divine. The picture 
seemed pleasing to neither Staniford nor Dunham ; 
they went on deck together, and sat down to their 



 

cigarettes in their wonted place. They did not talk 
of Lydia, or of any of the things that had formed 
the basis of their conversation hitherto, but Stam- 
ford returned to his Colorado scheme, and explained 
at length the nature of his purposes and expecta- 
tions. He had discussed these matters before, but 
he had never gone into them so fully, nor with 
such cheerful earnestness. He said he should never 
marry, — he had made up his mind to that; but he 
hoped to make money enough to take care of his 
sister's boy Jim handsomely, as the little chap had 
been named for him. He had been thinking the 
matter over, and lie believed that he should get 
back by rail and steamer as soon as he could after 
they reached Trieste. He was not sorry he had 
come ; but he could not afford to throw away too 
much time on Italy, just then. 

Dunham, on his part, talked a great deal of Miss 
Hibbard, and of some curious psychological char- 
acteristics of her dyspepsia. He asked Staniford 
whether he had ever shown him the photograph of 
Miss Hibbard taken by Sarony when she was on to 
New York the last time : it was a three-quarters 
view, and Dunham thought it the best she had had 
done. He spoke of her generous qualities, and of 
the interest she had always had in the Diet Kitchen, 
to which, as an invalid, her attention had been partic- 
ularly directed : and he said that in her last letter she 
had mentioned a project for establishing diet kitchens 
in Europe, on the Boston plan. When their talk 


grew more impersonal and took a wider range, they 
gathered suggestion from the situation, and remarked 
upon the immense solitude of the sea. They agreed 
that there was something weird in the long contin- 
uance of fine weather, and that the moon had a strange 
look. They spoke of the uncertainty of life. Dun- 
ham regretted, as he had often regretted before, that 
his friend had no fixed religious belief ; and Stam- 
ford gently accepted his solicitude, and said that he 
had at least a conviction if not a creed. He then 
begged Dunham's pardon in set terms for trying to 
wound his feelings the day before ; and in the silent 
hand-clasp that followed they renewed all the cor- 
diality of their friendship. From time to time, as 
they talked, the music from below came up fitfully, 
and once they had to pause as Lydia sang through 
the song that she and Hicks were practicing. 

As the days passed their common interest in the 
art brought Hicks and the young girl almost con- 
stantly together, and the sound of their concerting 
often filled the ship. The musicales, less formal 
than Dunham had intended, and perhaps for that 
reason a source of rapidly diminishing interest with 
him, superseded both ring-toss and shuffle-board, and 
seemed even more acceptable to the ship's company 
as an entertainment. One evening, when the per- 
formers had been giving a piece of rather more than 
usual excellence and difficulty, one of the sailors, 
deputed by his mates, came aft, with many clumsy 
shows of deference, and asked them to give March- 



 

ing through Georgia. Hicks found this out of his 
repertory, but Lydia sang it. Then the group at 
the forecastle shouted with one voice for Tramp, 
Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching, and so be- 
guiled her through the whole list of war-songs. She 
ended with one unknown to her listeners, but better 
than all the rest in its pathetic words and music, 
and when she had sung The Flag 's come back to 
Tennessee, the spokesman of the sailors came aft 
again, to thank her for his mates, and to say they 
would not spoil that last song by asking for any- 
thing else. It was a charming little triumph for 
her, as she sat surrounded by her usual court : the 
captain was there to countenance the freedom the 
sailors had taken, and Dunham and Stamford stood 
near, but Hicks, at her right hand, held the place 
of honor. 

The next night Staniford found her alone in the 
waist of the ship, and drew up a stool beside the 
rail where she sat. 

" We all enjoyed your singing so much, last 
night, Miss Blood. I think Mr. Hicks plays 
charmingly, but I believe I prefer to hear your 
voice alone." 

" Thank you," said Lydia, looking down, de- 
murely. 

" It must be a great satisfaction to feel that you 
can give so much pleasure."
