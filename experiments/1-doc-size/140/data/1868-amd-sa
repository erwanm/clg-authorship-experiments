that had not been satisfactorily bridged over; as if in 
some way I had mortally offended him. Did he think I 
ought to have told him before ? He surely was not a man 
to invite confidence. 

Perhaps I wrong him there. Ellen thinks him the in- 
carnation of manly goodness and nobility. She never 
wearies of talking about him. Once I said, "Is he at 
all like your hero?" and she answered, 

" He seems different from all other men. I believe a 
woman would be afraid to love him. My hero, as YOU call 
him, is more intensely human." 

Would a woman be afraid ? I once fancied 

No matter. I know now that it was a mistake. 

I waited in nervous anticipation for Philip. One even- 
ing he dropped in upon us, to the surprise of Mr. St. John. 



 

I had asked him to keep my secret, and he did it excel- 
lently. There was a momentary confusion in welcoming 
him, and then Miss Keith was introduced. She was pale 
as a lily, and kept in the shade of Mrs. Lawrence's flowing 
robes, but the hand she extended trembled visibly to watch- 
ful eyes. 

" This is an unexpected pleasure," Philip exclaimed. 
"Miss Keith and I are old friends." 

"I did not know that," and St. John looked puzzled. 

"We met last summer at Sulphur Springs." Then he 
paused and turned away, as if moved by a sudden con- 
sciousness. She was silent, too, and presently went to the 
table and took up a book she had been reading. 

I did not design to have him remain long in doubt ; 
but nothing ever happens as one plans it. Mr. St. John 
kept him engrossed the whole evening. I couLl absolutely 
have cried with vexation. 

But I came down early the next morning, and found 
him in the library. The happy face was grave and clouded, 
but he smiled at my entrance. A few commonplaces passed 
between us. 

"You don't look as if you had been very deeply trou- 
bled," he began. "If it would not sound like flattery, I 
should feel tempted to tell you wh:it I think." 

I held up my hands dcprecatingly, and said, 

"I have found beauty a rather perilous dower." 

"So soon?" 

" Don't laugh at me. Be kind and tender and impar- 
tial, and help me to decide whether I have committed a 
great crime or not; for I do need a friend." 

"My best is at your service, as you well know." 

I told him the story of Hugh Graham's ill-fated passion, 
and could hardly repress my delight at the interest he 
displayed, all the deeper for another woman's sake; yet I 




had no selfish feeling about it. And then I spoke of Mr. 
St. John's comments. 

"I do not see where you were to blame," he said, with 
sweet seriousness. " But I am sorry you and St. John 
disagree. Since you cannot help being beautiful, I sup- 
pose we must pity your misfortunes. And it has been 
productive of some good, for it will save two people from, 
an ill-assorted, loveless marriage, and give to another 
Sydnie, I must tell you. I met Ellen Keith, and loved her 
unwittingly. If I had known all then, I might have 
spoken ; but I believed I had no right. To hear that she 
is free free," and he lingered softly over the word. " Yet 
how cold and shy she was last night." 

" She would not flaunt her love in any man's face," I 
said, warmly. 

" No. She is purity and delicacy itself; and heroic, 
too. Last summer she put away the tempting cup with 
firm hand. God only could know the anguish of her soul. 
It shall be repaid a thousand fold. So you see I cannot 
blame you." 

The others were in the hall, and we went to breakfast. 
Ellen was pale, as if she had scarcely slept. Mr. St. John 
remarked it. 

" You are losing your roses," he said, with kindly so- 
licitude. "As the morning promises to be fine, I think 
we must have a brisk canter over the hills. You will not 
mind the cold." 

Her eyes brightened at that. 

" It will be different from the lazy rides we used to have 
when you were in Now York," Philip said to me. " I sec- 
ond the proposal with all my heart." 

We waited until the sun was making rapid strides in 
the blue arch overhead. It was a really delightful winter 
day, with a crisp but not unpleasant air. Mr. St. John 



 

tacitly gave Philip his choice of a companion, and I fell to 
his share. 

We had some odd, sharp skirmishing. I was in a 
splendid humor, too happy to be irritated by anything he 
could say. And somewhere on the road Ellen found her 
roses. 

I fancied that Mr. St. John suspected Philip's penchant. 
They were left a good deal to themselves the remainder 
of the day and evening. Ellen ran into my room the 
last thing at night, blushing and happy, yet timid as a 
fawn. 

"And so the prince won the princess?"! exclaimed, 
laughingly. 

"O, Syclnie! did you guess?" and the sweet face was
