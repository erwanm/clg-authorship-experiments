different language. He will not need to go away 
into the still places of jiature to find rest and 



peace, for they will abide with him. But, if he 
narrow his life down to the merest selfish ends, 
seeking, as some disordered member of the body, 
to appropriate only, and not to give to act for 
himself alone, and not in concert with the whole 
for the health and well-being of the whole then 
he will be out of tune. His life will be jarred by 
perpetual discords, and he will vainly imagine 
that he is suffering from defect of harmony in 
society, when the defect is in himself. 

" This," added my friend, " is the lesson I have 
learned. Taking my peculiar mental construction, 
there was no way for me to learn it but by the 
hard one of experience. I had to drop out of the 
orchestra and try my instrument alone. What 
poor music I'm ade, sitting afar off in solitary 
places by myself! I thought it passing sweet at 
first; but its thinness and monotony soon wearied, 
and at last disgusted me. I longed for choral 
harmonies. How they ravished my ears when 
their chorded delights broke into them again !" 



 



VI. 

SUNDAY RELIGION. 

" "IT ERE Sunday religion, and not worth anything," 
said a lady, whose age and appear 
ance gave weight to her words. The remark 
seemed to occasion something like surprise in the 
little group around her. 

"What do you mean by Sunday religion?" 
was asked. 

"Pious observances of any kind singing, 
praying, listening to sermons, reading the Bible, 
receiving the sacraments, and the like." 

"And do you mean to say that these are worth 
nothing as means to the attainment of a heavenly 
life?" 

"No; far from it. They are of inestimable 
value ; I'm ight almost say of essential value." 

"Then," said the other, "I am at a loss to 



comprehend your meaning. Sunday religion not 
worth anything !" 

"Mere Sunday religion, I said, which is about 
all the religion possessed by the large class to 
whom I was referring. An exterior of sanctity, 
without a living principle of charity in the heart ; 
that is the Sunday religion I'm eant to condemn." 

"There is too much of that, I fear," was an 
swered. 

" Too much, alas !" 

" It is a self-deceiving form of hypocrisy," remarked 
one of the company. 

"And as such," said the lady, "without any 
saving principle. Men and women may sing and 
pray devoutly read the w r ord of God in all so 
lemnity of utterance hear preachings receive 
the sacred correspondential elements in the com 
munion give of their substance to churches 
and yet be in the broad way to destruction, in 
stead of in the narrow way to heaven. All these 
things will be as nothing if the week-day life fail. 
If, from Monday morning until Saturday night, 



 

love of self and the world rule the whole mind, 
all Sunday service will go for nothing in our ac 
count with heaven. In every day of every week 
we are writing down that history of our lives by 
which we shall be judged when this mortal puts 
on immortality ; and will not six days of God- 
forgetting selfishness stand in fearful contrast with 
a Sunday record of constrained worship ?" 

"Must religion come down into everything?" 
was asked. " How can you bring piety into 
trade ? It does not follow, because a man is ear 
nest in his employment, that he is sinning against 
God. Nothing can be done rightly, unless the 
mind goes into it with full vigor ; and a man can 
not think of business and religion at the same 
time. He who made us, comprehended this, and 
set apart one day in seven for religious thoughts 
and duties. I'm  afraid you depress the value of 
our Sabbath ceremonials." 

" It is not in my heart to do so, for I find in 
them both help and comfort," replied the lady, 
whose remark had led the conversation in this di- 



 

rection. " Of all good gifts from our heavenly 
Father, I prize, as among the bast, this Chris 
tian Sabbath, when we may lay down our bur 
dens of care and work, and gather up strength, 
hope, encouragement, and lessons of spiritual wis 
dom, by which to lead truer, because more unself 
ish, lives, in the days to come. But, if it is used 
as the only means of advancing heavenward, 
through devotional acts, and neither God nor the 
neighbor be regarded in the weeks that follow, 
then will its services be in vain. There must be 
religion in business, or there can be no religion at 
all." 

" I am at fault as to your entire meaning," said 
the one who had previously spoken. " Religion 
in business ! that is a novel proposition. Would
