the hawks screamed.  But as time went on, and no sign of the boys
appeared, the men grew anxious, and began to fear some serious harm had
come to the runaways.
"I can’t go home without them little shavers no way, ’specially Tommy,"
said Mr. Mullin, as they stopped to rest after a hard climb through the
blasted grove.  "He’s a boy after my own heart, spry as a chipmunk,
smart as a young cockerel, and as full of mischief as a monkey. He ain’t
afraid of anything, and I should n’t be a mite surprised to find him
enjoyin’ himself first-rate, and as cool as a coocumber."
"The fat boy won’t take it so easily, I fancy. If it had n’t been for
him I ’d have kept the lively fellow with me, and shown him how to hunt.
Sorry now I did n’t take them both home," said the man with the gun,
seeing his mistake too late, as people often do.
"Maybe they ’ve fell down a precipice and got killed, like Moses Warner,
when he was lost," suggested a tall fellow, who had shouted himself
hoarse.
"Hush up, and come on!  The dog is barkin’ yonder, and he may have found
’em," said the farmer, hurrying toward the place where the hound was
baying at something in a tree.
It was poor Billy, hanging there still, half unconscious with weariness
and fear.  The belt had slipped up under his arms, so he could breathe
easily; and there he was, looking like a queer sort of cone on the
blasted pine.
"Wal, I never!" exclaimed the farmer, as the tall lad climbed up, and,
unhooking Billy, handed him down like a young bird, into the arms held
up to catch him.
"He ’s all right, only scared out of his wits.  Come along and look for
the other one.  I ’ll warrant he went for help, and may be half-way home
by this time," said the hunter, who did n’t take much interest in the
fat boy.
Tommy’s hat lay on the ground; and showing it to the dog, his master
told him to find the boy.  The good hound sniffed about, and then set
off with his nose to the ground, following the zigzag track Tommy had
taken in his hurry. The hunter and several of the men went after him,
leaving the farmer with the others to take care of Billy.
Presently the dog came to the bear-pit, and began to bark again.
"He ’s got him!" cried the men, much relieved; and rushing on soon saw
the good beast looking down at a little white object in one corner of
the dark hole.
It was Tommy’s face in the moonlight, for the rest of him was covered up
with leaves.  The little round face seemed very quiet; and for a moment
the men stood quite still, fearing that the fall might have done the boy
some harm. Then the hunter leaped down, and gently touched the brown
cheek.  It was warm, and a soft snore from the pug nose made the man
call out, much relieved,--
"He ’s all right.  Wake up here, little chap; you are wanted at home.
Had hunting enough for this time?"
As he spoke, Tommy opened his eyes, gave a stretch, and said, "Hollo,
Billy," as calmly as if in his own bed at home.  Then the rustle of the
leaves, the moonlight in his face, and the sight of several men staring
down at him startled him wide awake.
"Did you shoot the big bear?" he asked, looking up at the hunter with a
grin.
"No; but I caught a little one, and here he is," answered the man,
giving Tommy a roll in the leaves, much pleased because he did not whine
or make a fuss.
"Got lost, didn’t we?  Oh, I say, where’s Billy?  I left him up a tree
like a coon, and he would n’t come down," laughed Tommy, kicking off his
brown bed-clothes, and quite ready to get up now.
They all laughed with him; and presently, when the story was told, they
pulled the boy out of the pit, and went back to join the other wanderer,
who was now sitting up eating the bread and butter Mrs. Mullin sent for
their very late supper.
The men roared again, as the two boys told their various tribulations;
and when they had been refreshed, the party started for home, blowing
the tin horns, and firing shot after shot to let the scattered searchers
know that the lost children were found.  Billy was very quiet, and
gladly rode on the various broad backs offered for his use; but Tommy
stoutly refused to be carried, and with an occasional "boost" over a
very rough place, walked all the way down on his own sturdy legs.  He
was the hero of the adventure, and was never tired of relating how he
caught the woodchuck, cooked the fish, slid down the big rock, and went
to bed in the old bear-pit.  But in his own little mind he resolved to
wait till he was older before he tried to be a hunter; and though he
caught several woodchucks that summer, he never shot another harmless
little bird.
                                 VIII.
                             THE FAIRY BOX.
"T wish I had a magic bracelet like Rosamond’s, that would prick me when
I was going to do wrong," said little May, as she put down the story she
had been reading.
There was no one else in the room, but she heard a sweet voice sing
these words close to her ear:--
    "Now hark, little May,
      If you want to do right,
    Under your pillow
      Just look every night.
    If you have been good
      All through the day,
    A gift you will find,
      Useful or gay;
    But if you have been
      Cross, selfish, or wild,
    A bad thing will come
      For the naughty child.
    So try, little dear,
      And soon you will see
    How easy and sweet
      To grow good it will be."
May was very much surprised at this, and looked everywhere to see who
spoke, but could find no one.
"I guess I dreamed it; but my eyes are wide open, and I can’t make up
poetry, asleep or awake."
As she said that, some one laughed; and the same voice sang again,--
    "Ha, ha! you can’t see,
      Although I am here;
    But listen to what
      I say in your ear.
    Tell no one of this,
      Because, if you do,
    My fun will be spoilt,
      And so will yours too.
    But if you are good,
      And patient, and gay,
    A real fairy will come
      To see little May."
"Oh, how splendid that will be!  I ’ll try hard, and be as good as an
angel if I can only get one peep at a live fairy.  I always said, there
were such people, and now I shall know how they look," cried the little
girl, so pleased that she danced all about the room, clapping her hands.
Something bright darted out of the window from among the flowers that
stood there, and no more songs were heard; so May knew that the elf had
gone.
"I ’ve got a fine secret all to myself, and I ’ll keep it carefully.  I
wonder what present will come to-night," she said, thinking this a very
interesting play.
She was very good all day, and made no fuss about going to bed, though
usually she fretted, and wanted to play, and called for water, and
plagued poor Nursey in many ways.  She got safely into her little nest,
and then was in such a hurry to see what was under her pillow that she
forgot, and called out crossly,--
"Do hurry and go away.  Don’t wait to hang up my clothes, you slow old
thing!  Go, go!"
That hurt Nurse’s feelings, and she went away without her good-night
kiss.  But May did n’t care, and felt under her pillow the minute the
door was shut.  A lamp was always left burning; so she could see the
little gold box she drew out.
"How pretty!  I hope there is some candy in it," she said, opening it
very carefully.
Oh, dear! what do you think happened?  A wasp flew out and stung her
