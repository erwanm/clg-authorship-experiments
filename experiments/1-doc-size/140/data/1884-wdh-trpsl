any sort, he bore them with the patience of defeat. 
His wife wished to praise him, but she did not know 
how ; so she offered him a little reproach, in which 
alone she touched the cause of her behaviour at part- 



 

ing. " Silas," she asked, after a long gaze at him, "why 
didn't you tell me you had Jim Millon's girl there ? " 

"I didn't suppose you'd like it, Persis," he 
answered. " I did intend to tell you at first, but 
then I put I put it off. I thought you'd come 
round some day, and find it out for yourself." 

"I'm punished," said his wife, "for not taking 
enough interest in your business to even come near 
it. If we 're brought back to the day of small things, 
I guess it J s a lesson for me, Silas." 

"Oh, I don't know about the lesson," he said 
wearily. 

That night she showed him the anonymous scrawl 
which had kindled her fury against him. He turned 
it listlessly over in his hand. " I guess I know who 
it 's from," he said, giving it back to her, " and I 
guess you do too, Persis." 

"But how how could he " 

"Mebbe he believed it," said Lapham, with 
patience that cut her more keenly than any re 
proach. " You did. ' 

Perhaps because the process of his ruin had been 
so gradual, perhaps because the excitement of pre 
ceding events had exhausted their capacity for 
emotion, the actual consummation of his bankruptcy 
brought a relief, a repose to Lapham and his family, 
rather than a fresh sensation of calamity. In the 
shadow of his disaster they returned to something 
like their old, united life ; they were at least all 
together again ; and it will be intelligible to those 
whom life has blessed with vicissitude, that Lapham 



 

should come home the evening after he had given up 
everything^) his creditors, and should sit down to 
his supper so cheerful that Penelope could joke him 
in the old way, and tell him that she thought from 
his looks they had concluded to pay him a hundred 
cents on every dollar he owed them. 

As James Bellingham had taken so much interest 
in his troubles from the first, Lapham thought he 
ought to tell him, before taking the final step, just 
how things stood with him, and what he meant to 
do. Bellingham made some futile inquiries about 
his negotiations with the West Virginians, and 
Lapham told him they had come to nothing. He 
spoke of the New York man, and the chance that 
he might have sold out half his business to him. 
" But, of course, I had to let him know how it was 
about those fellows." 

" Of course," said Bellingham, not seeing till after 
wards the full significance of Lapham's action. 

Lapham said nothing about Rogers and the 
Englishmen. He believed that he had acted right 
in that matter, and he was satisfied ; but he did not 
care to have Bellingham, or anybody, perhaps, think 
he had been a fool 

All those who were concerned in his affairs said 
he behaved well, and even more than well, when it 
came to the worst. The prudence, the good sense, 
which he had shown in the first years of his success, 
and of which his great prosperity seemed to have 
bereft him, came back, and these qualities, used in 
his own behalf, commended him as much to his 



 

creditors as the anxiety he showed that no one 
should suffer by him ; this even made some of 
them doubtful of his sincerity. They gave him 
time, and there would have been no trouble in his 
resuming on the old basis, if the ground had not 
been cut from under him by the competition of the 
West Virginia company. He saw himself that it 
was useless to try to go on in the old way, and he 
preferred to go back and begin the world anew 
where he had first begun it, in the hills at Lapham. 
He put the house at Nankeen Square, with every 
thing else he had, into the payment of his debts, and 
Mrs. Lapham found it easier to leave it for the old 
farmstead in Vermont than it would have been to go 
from that home of many years to the new house on 
the water side of Beacon. This thing and that is 
embittered to us, so that we may be willing to re 
linquish it ; the world, life itself, is embittered to 
most of us, so that we are glad to have done with 
them at last ; and this home was haunted with such 
memories to each of those who abandoned it that to 
go was less exile than escape. Mrs. Lapham could 
not look into Irene's room without seeing the girl 
there before her glass, tearing the poor little keep 
sakes of her hapless fancy from their hiding-places 
to take them and fling them in passionate renuncia 
tion upon her sister ; she could not come into the 
sitting-room, where her little ones had grown up, 
without starting at the thought of her husband sitting 
so many weary nights at his desk there, trying to 
fight his way back to hope out of the ruin into which 

 

he was slipping. When she remembered that night 
when Rogers came, she hated the place. Irene ac 
cepted her release from the house eagerly, and was 
glad to go before and prepare for the family at Lap- 
ham. Penelope was always ashamed of her engage 
ment there ; it must seem better somewhere else, 
and she was glad to go too. No one but Lapham, 
in fact, felt the pang of parting in all its keenness. 
Whatever regret the others had was softened to 
them by the likeness of their flitting to many of 
those removals for the summer which they made in 
the late spring when they left Nankeen Square ; they 
were going directly into the country instead of to 
the seaside first ; but Lapham, who usually remained
