Kathie walked in and introduced her Uncle 
Eobert very gracefully. Old Mrs. Morrison, white- 
haired and placid -looking, sat in a large rocking- 
chair with a year-old baby on her knee, while a little 
boy stood beside his father, who was repairing the 
clock. 


 


Uncle Robert began a pleasant conversation, and 
gradually led the way to business. He found Mr. 
Morrison an intelligent, practical man, and was very 
well satisfied with him. Everything about the house 
looked clean and orderly, though it was plain. 

“ A man with a family doesn’t have much chance 
to get forehanded,” Mr. Morrison was saying. 
“ Wages are low, and every week lost in the dull 
season counts. Sometimes I ’ve thought of going to 
the West ; but it ’s a hard thing to get started.” 

“ I believe my niece has an offer to make you, 
Mr. Morrison, and it may be as advantageous as 
trying your fortune elsewhere,” Mr. Conover made 
answer. 

“ Oh Uncle Robert, it isn’t really mine. I only 
said — ” and Kathie paused, blushing deeply. 

“ Well, you may say it over again ” ; and he 
smiled, encouragingly. 

“ It ’s to come and live in the gardener’s cottage 
at our new house,” Kathie said, hurriedly, seeing 
that she was expected to speak. 

“ We want a lodge-keeper and gardener, some one 
who will look after the place, and since you were 
brought up on a farm I think you might do very 


 


well. Kathie mentioned you when I was making 
some inquiries.” 

“ Oh Miss Kathie, I ’m so grateful to you ! ” and a 
quick tear sprang to Mr. Morrison’s eye. “ It ’s 
just what I would like above all things. I ’ll try 
never to make you regret your good word. And 
Mary will be overjoyed. I wish she was at home.” 
“ I ’d like you to come as soon as you can. We 
expect to take possession in the course of a fort- 
night, and it seems quite difficult to get all the 
help we want, — of the right kind. The house is 
all ready to be occupied.” 

“ Indeed, sir, I could come right away. Though 
we have paid our rent here in advance, that will 
not be much of an object.” 

Mr. Conover stated the terms he had thought of 
offering. To Mr. Morrison they appeared generous. 

“ You can come over to-morrow and see how 
you like it. I shall be there nearly all day.” 

“ I don’t know how to thank you, but I shall 
do my best to deserve your favor.” 

“ We owe much of our good fortune to Miss 
Kathie, I ’m sure,” said grandmother, in a tremu- 
lous voice. The Lord bless you, child, for caring 


 


for the poor and needy. I ’m sure I rejoice in your 
prosperity.” 

“ It ’s so nice to he able to do these things ! ” Ka- 
thie exclaimed, clasping Uncle Eobert’s hand as they 
walked slowlv homeward. “ Mamma once said the 
fairies didn’t all live in palaces.” 

“ No, for I found one in a very humble cottage ; 
but I shall transport her to the best at my com- 
mand.” 

Kathie laughed gayly. 

A few days after Mr. Morrison removed his family 
to the pretty little house awaiting them. Mrs. Mor- 
rison had to come and express her thanks in person. 

“ It was a perfect godsend to us. Poor Hugh 
was getting so discouraged. O Mrs. Alston, it is 
n’t every one who in prosperity remembers the poor. 
You ought to be proud indeed of Miss Kathie.” 

“ I am thankful to God for her, which is better,” 
Mrs. Alston returned, with a sweet smile. 

The carpets came down, and were soon fitted to 
their respective places. Kathie thought them love- 
lier than ever. Then quantities of furniture, until 
she almost wondered if they would ever find a 
place for it all. 


 


Latterly she had not gone to school, as it was so 
near vacation, and Uncle Robert was very fond of 
having her lor a companion. She was delighted 
now in watching the completion of their plans. 

Aunt Ruth’s room looked lovely. Kathie kept 
admiring every new article that was brought into 
it, and when the pictures came to be hung she 
declared it perfect. 

“ Haven’t you any curiosity to see yours ? ” 
Uncle Robert asked. 

“ Is it done yet ? ” 

“ Finished yesterday afternoon. Shall I conduct 
you to your realm of enchantment ? ” 

“ Oh ! ” and Kathie sprang up eagerly. 

Two steps at a time they went, laughing gayly 
Uncle Robert took the key out of his pocket.
