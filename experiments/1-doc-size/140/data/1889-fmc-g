and covered her poor painted face decently with a sheet and went 
away, closing the door softly behind them. 

For a moment they stood looking at each other earnestly. Then 
Rieseneck took from his pocket his brother's gift and laid it upon 
the table. 

' It is time for us also,' he said. 

' Yes. I must write to Greif first.' 

Half an hour later the short and terrible tragedy was completed, 
and of the three persons who had sat together at the table, suffering 
each in his or her own way as much as each could bear, not one 
was left alive to tell the tale. 

Outside the house of death, the silent, spotless snow gleamed 
in the light of the waning moon. Not a breath of wind sighed 
amongst the stately black trees. Only, far below, the tumbling 
torrent roared through its half-frozen bed, and high above, from 
the summit of the battlement that had sheltered so many genera- 
tions of Greifensteins from danger in war, and in peace from the 
bitter north wind, the great horned owls sent forth their melancholy 
note, from time to time, and opened wide their cruel hungry eyes, 
as the dismal sound echoed away among the dark firs. 

Then all was confusion in an instant, within and without. 
Lights flashed out over the snow from the deep, low gateway, 
voices rang in accents of alarm through the halls and spacious 
corridors, huge watch-dogs sprang to the length of their rattling 
chains and bellowed out their deep-mouthed cries, the shrieks of 
frightened women rose high above the noise and were drowned 
again by the loud bass voices of excited serving-men. Then there 
was the clatter of iron shoes upon the stone pavements as the 
startled horses were led out into the moonlight from their warm 



 

dark stalls, the tinkle of curb chains, the wheeze of tightening 
leather girths, the clicking of curb and snaffle between champing 
teeth, the purselike chink of spurs on booted heels, the soft dull 
thud of riders springing into saddles. The iron-studded gates 
creaked back upon their huge hinges, as the burly porter, pale with 
fear, dragged open the heavy oak panels. Lanterns flashed, stable- 
boys and house servants elbowed each other in the narrow way 
and flattened themselves against the damp stone walls, as they 
heard the tramp of the approaching feet. Then four strong horses 
trotted out, two and two, into the moonlight beyond, each bearing 
on his back a messenger of the terrible tidings, and all breaking 
into a brisk gallop as the party disappeared in the mottled black 
and white distance under the mighty trees. One rode for Sigmund- 
skron, and one for the nearest surgeon, one for the distant town, 
and one to bear the ghastly tale to Greif himself, the nameless 
orphan, who at that moment was marching sword in hand beside 
the tall standard of his Korps, at the head of a thousand students, 
in all the magnificence of his fantastic dress, leading the great 
torchlight procession which closed the academic year, and which 
crowned with a splendid revelry the last act of his student life. 
As he strode along, proud, successful, popular, the envy of all his 
fellows, the idol of his Korps companions, pale-faced servants were 
laying the body of his father beside his dead mother in the state 
chamber of Greifenstein, and frightened menials were trembling 
under the weight of the tall dead man whose snowy beard blew 
about in such fantastic waves before the draught of every opened 
door. As he went up the steps of the festal drinking-hall wherein 
the last students' feast of the year was to be celebrated, and over 
which he himself was to preside, three women were met together 
in distant Sigmundskron, repeating the service for the dead, before 
the smouldering embers of their poor fire, by the dim light of their 
one smoking candle. An hour later, as the orchestra thundered 
out the strains of the soul-stirring Landesvater, sustaining but not 
covering the glorious chorus of a thousand fresh young voices, a 
grey-haired woman in a dark cloak was riding slowly through the 
snowy ways of the dismal forest, her horse led carefully by the 
booted groom who had brought the news. Her face was paler 
than ever it was wont to be, but not less brave. Her well-worn 
mantle was no fit covering against the bitter Christmas air, but 
her heart was not cold within. She knew that Greif would come 
in the morning, or at noontime, and cost what it might, she would 
not let him face his awful sorrow alone, or feel that none but a 
hired hand had smoothed his dead mother's faded hair, or closed 



 

his dead father's staring eyes. She did what she could. She sat 
as she might upon the man's saddle, and she faced the cruel cold 
unflinchingly, encouraging the fellow who led her horse with such 
words and promises as she was able to devise. 

But the distance was great, the snow was deep, and the stout 
Mecklenburger roan had breasted the steep road at a gallop only an 
hour before. The castle clock was striking half-past four when 
the strong-hearted Lady of Sigmundskron was lifted from her seat 
to the pavement within the walls of Greifenstein, half dead with 
cold, and horrified at the thought of what she had come to see, 
but calm, determined and full of dignity as only women, and such 
women, can be, in the presence of a horrible catastrophe. She 
took what they offered her, a glass of strong wine and a slice 
of venison, scarcely cold from the ghastly meal that had preceded 
the tragedy. She did not suffer herself to think whence it came, 
for she needed strength, not only to do her duty, but to impose 
order and quiet in the terrified household. Then she listened to 
the story and visited the rooms. There were policemen in the 
house, quiet men in dark uniforms with great yellow beards and 
grave faces, and there was the surgeon, an insignificant country 
leech in spectacles, who would have been pompous anywhere else 
and at any other time, but who looked singularly helpless and 
subdued. Other officials would doubtless come in the course of the 
early morning, to report upon what had happened, but now that 
there was a responsible person present, a relation of the dead and 
one in authority, no great difficulty could arise. One thing only 
Frau von Sigmundskron had not understood, and that involved the 
understanding of all the rest. She did not know who the 
stranger was, whose coming seemed to have led to the final catas- 
trophe. She guessed indeed that he must be Eieseneck, but there 
was no evidence of his identity. It was not until she had been three 
hours in the house that she extracted from one of the servants an 
account of what had occurred before the three had so suddenly left 
the dinner-table. The man remembered having been told that 
the visitor was Herr Brandt, but his mistress, when he was waiting 
at the guest's side had certainly called him by another name. It 

was ' von Biesen' and something more. The servant was sure 

of that, and the baroness was satisfied. She did not care to tell 
him what the name really was, for she began to see dimly that the 
triple murder and suicide were in some way the result of the exile's 
coming. Nothing had been found, not a scrap of writing to give 
an explanation, not a sign to indicate a clue. The surgeon's 
evidence was simple. The lady had been strangled, the two 



 

gentlemen had shot themselves. Nothing showed that there had
