any means avoid the long drive in her company, and he tried to 
harden his heart as he submitted to his destiny. It was certain 
that, unless she had changed her mind, she would talk of the 
matter of his visit, and would repeat in his unwilling ear all those 
arguments which appealed to his heart so strongly, and which so 
grievously shook his chivalrous resolution. 

During the long night that succeeded the day of the funeral 
ceremony, the sorrow of the parting which was before him 
assumed such proportions as made the past seem less horrible, and 
the change from one kind of suffering to another afforded his ex- 
hausted nature a relief of which he was not conscious, but which 
was nevertheless very real. He himself could not understand how 
it had been possible for him to discuss with Rex matters so closely 
connected with his future happiness, scarcely an hour after the 
heavy gates of the mausoleum had closed upon the father he had 
so deeply loved, and upon the mother he so tenderly regretted. 
For he did mourn for her sincerely, in spite of his earlier indif- 
ference. He was yet too near the catastrophe to attempt to 
explain it, but in the confusion of his grief her words came vividly 



 

to his mind. He recalled the expression of her face when she had 
implored him not to forsake her, whatever happened, and he knew 
that in some way she must, even then, have had a forewarning of 
her end. He remembered many strange incongruities in her 
manner, which he had once disliked intensely, but which now 
pointed to the existence of a secret in her quiet life, and which, 
having seemed contemptible when she had been alive, took a tragic 
importance now that she was gone. He recalled very clearly that 
morning when he had felt a thrill of pitying tenderness for the 
lonely woman, and when she had responded so suddenly and 
passionately to his simple words. He had never loved her, and 
had perhaps had little cause for any affection, but the suddenness 
and the horror of her death strengthened in him every kind 
memory, and overshadowed by its dark presence whatever in her 
life had lacked dignity and worth. 

As for his father, he had felt for him a passionate devotion of 
which he dared not think now. And yet he had been able to talk 
with Rex, if not freely, at least with a complete command of his 
faculties. He would have reproached himself with heartlessness, 
but when his thoughts dwelt upon those he had lost, he knew that 
the self-accusation was unmerited. Not comprehending what passed 
in his own mind, and finding himself face to face with a problem 
that seemed to involve his own life or death, it is not altogether 
surprising that he should have persisted in undergoing a self-imposed 
suffering which he almost unconsciously regarded as a test of heroism. 

But as he did his best to fortify himself in his intention another 
power stood before him, not a gloomy presence of evil, not a 
sorrowful but relentless fate, not a thing in itself terrible, grand 
or heroic, and yet stronger and more real than any of those other 
shadows which surrounded his life. He had not known that it was 
with him in such a shape, he had not realised what it would be to 
face that which has conquered all men sooner or later. The love 
of Hilda, which had softened all his youth, but which in its un- 
opposed calm had seemed so gentle and tender that by an effort of 
his strong will he might put it off if he would, the quiet spirit of 
calm which had been with him so long, purifying his thoughts, 
simplifying his hopes for the future, encouraging him ever in each 
present day, the love of untarnished youth for spotless maidenhood 
rose up like the dawn upon a traveller in a strange land, shedding 
its universal light upon the secret places of his soul. It was a 
wonderful revelation of beauty appearing in the midst of his 
sorrow, contrasting the magnificence of its splendour with the 
darkness in which he would have hidden himself. 



 

He groaned as he lay alone in his solitary chamber, and the 
passionate tears burst from his eyes. He had met at last that 
which must vanquish all his resolutions, and turn all his desperate 
efforts into vanity. That sudden flash of radiance in the midst of 
his grief was but a dark shadow compared with the light of Hilda's 
face. If the mere thought of her made all resistance seem im- 
possible, would he be able to go to her to-morrow and tell her that 
they must part ? But it was not a mere thought, as he called it. 
He had thought of her for years, but never in this way ; she had 
dwelt in his heart a long time but he had never felt anything 
like this. It was true that he had never resisted her presence 
before. Could that be the reason ? Could it be that love was a 
companion for the weakest of mankind, if kindly entertained, and 
yet, if resisted, the master of the very strongest? Greif in his 
pride of youth believed himself as strong as any, and the sensation 
of being thus utterly overpowered was crushing and humiliating. 
He would not yield, but he well knew that he was conquered 
beforehand, and must be led away captive in the end. 

He sat up and tried to reason with himself. It was but an 
illusion after all, and it was just such an illusion as should 
strengthen his purpose. If Hilda were indeed, as she doubtless 
was, this exquisitely lovely creature, could anything be more con- 
temptible than to give her a name which must be a reproach, a 
position in which her beautiful life must be made half shameful 
by the memory of hideous crimes ? 

Momentarily satisfied with himself, he once more laid his head 
upon the pillow, but he had hardly closed his eyes when Rex's 
suggestion flashed through his brain, and Hilda's clear voice seemed 
to cry ' Sigmundskron ! ' in his ears. The thought of bearing 
another name, of being no longer Greifenstein, of being the father 
of a new race in a new home, presented itself to him in all its 
attractions. After all, said Rex to his conscience, you are wholly 
innocent, and it is only the sound of the name to which you object 
or which you fear for her. Take hers and be happy under it, since 
you would be miserable under your own. After all, one is as good 
as another, and it would be better to be plain Herr Rex than to 
throw over the joy of a lifetime for the sake of three syllables that 
have a disagreeable ring. Names are nonsense and a man's reputa- 
tion is his own, not to be made or marred by his father's evil deeds. 
The Sigmundskrons know all, and it is for them to judge, not for 
you. If they will make you one of them, what right have you to 
make them unhappy for the sake of your own prejudices ? 

Greif was very young to cope with such difficulties, when even 



 

love itself was against him. Though. Rex said little, that little 
was eloquent and full of practical sense, like many of Rex's sayings. 
Greif shed bitter tears and ground his teeth and wrung his hands. 

' Hilda ! Hilda ! ' he cried aloud in his solitude, l what would you 
have me do, if you knew all, if you knew me, if you knew my heart !' 

When a man appeals against his love to the woman who loves 
him, his resolutions are at their last gasp for existence. Hilda 
answered his heart before the spoken words were out of his mouth. 

' Love me, dear that is all I ask ! ' It was as though her 
voice mingling with his own souMed aloud in the lonely room, 
and Greif started up, his eyes wide open, his breath caught upon
