going off." 

Whatever he should catch, he determined to " face 
the music," and left the room to find his employer. 


CHAPTER XV. 

IX WHICH HARRY MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OP 
A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE. 

Major Phillips was in the counting room, where 
Hairy, dreading his anger, presented himself before 
bim. His employer was a violent man. He usually 
acted first, and thought the matter over afterwards ; 
so that he frequently had occasion to undo what had 
been done in haste and passion. His heart was 
kind, but his temper generally had the first word. 

" So you have come, Harry," exclaimed he, as 
our hero opened the door. " Where have you 
been ? " 

" I have been out a little while," replied Harry, 
whose modesty rebelled at the idea of proclaiming 
the good deed he had done. 

" Out a little while ! " roared the major, with aa 
aath that froze the boy's blood. " That is enough — 



 

M'ougli, sir. You know I don't allow man or boy to 
leave the stable without letting me know it." 

" I was wrong, sir ; but I " 

" You little snivelling monkey, how dared you 
Ipave the stable ? " continued the stable keeper, heed- 
less of the boy's submission. " I'll teach you better 
than that." 

" Will you ? " said Harry, suddenly changing h;s 
tone, as his blood began to boil. " You can begia 
as quick as you like." 

" You saucy young cub ! I have a great mind to 
give you a cowhiding," thundered the enraged stable 
keeper. 

" I should like to see you do it," replied Harry, 
fixing his eyes on the poker that lay on the floor 
near the stove. 

" Should you, you impertinent puppy ? " 

The hiajor sprang forward, as if to grasp the boj 
I y the collar ; but Harry, with his eye still fixed 
on the poker, retreated a pace or two, ready to act 
pn mptly when the decisive moment should come. 
Forgetting for the time that he had run away from 
ne duty to attend to another, be felt indignant that 



he should bo thus rudely treated for being absent a 
short time on an errand of love and charity. H>? 
gave himself too Jauch credit for the good deed, and 
felt that he was a martyr to his philanthropic spirit. 
He was willing to bear all and brave all in a good 
cause ; and it seemed to him, just then, as though 
he was being punished for assisting Joe Flint's fam- 
ily, instead of for leaving his place without permis- 
sion. A great many persons who mean well are apt 
to think themselves martyrs for any good cause in 
wlich they may be engagad, when, in reality, their 
own want of tact, or the offensive manner in which 
they present their truth, is the stake at which they 
are burned. 

" Keep off! " said Harry, his eyes flashing fire. 

The major was so angry that he could do nothing; 
and while they were thus confronting each other, Joe 
Flint staggered into the counting room. Intoxicated 
as he was, he readily discovered the position of affairs 
between the belligerents. 

"Look here — hie — Major Phillips," said he, 
reeling up to his employer, " I love you, — hie, — 
Major Pnillips, like a — hie — like a brother, Ma^oi 




Phillips; but if you touch that boy, Mujor Phillipt 
I'll — hie — you touch me, Major Phillips. That's 
all." 

' Go home. Joe," replied the stable keeper, his 
attention diverted from Harry to the new comba- 
tant. " You are drunk." 

" I know I'm drunk, Major Phillips. I'm as drunk 
as a beast ; but I ain't — hie — dead drunk. I know 
what I'm about." 

" No, you don't. Go home." 

" Yes, I dzoo. I'm a brute ; I'm a hog ; I'm a — 
dzwhat you call it ? I'm a villain." 

Joe tried to straighten himself up, and look at his 
employer ; but he could not, and suddenly bursting 
into tears, he threw himself heavily into a chair, 
weeping bitterly in his inebriate paroxysm. He 
sobbed, and groaned, and talked incoherently. He 
acted strangely, and Major Phillips's attention was 
excited. 

" What is the matter, Joe?" he asked; and hig 
anger towards Harry seemed to have subsideu. 

" I tell you I am a villain, Major }"hilhpn." blub- 
ber el Joe, 


" What do you mean by that ? ' ' 

" Haven't I been on a drunk, and left my lamilj 
to starve and freeze?" groaned Joe, inteilardii-g his 
ipeech with violent ebullitions of weeping. " Wouldn't 
my poor wife, and my poor children — O my God ! " 
and the poor drunkard covered his face with his 
hands, and sobbed like an infant. 

" AVhat is the matter ? What do you mean, Joe ? " 
asked Major Phillips, who had never seen him in
