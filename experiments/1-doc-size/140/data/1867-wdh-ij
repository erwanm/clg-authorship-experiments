When we turned off from the Rovigo road at Bat- 
taglia we were only three miles from Arqua. 



Now, all the way from this turning to the foot of 
the hill on which the village was stretched asleep in 
the tender sunshine, there was on either side of the 
road a stream of living water. There was no other 
barrier than this between the road and the fields 
(unless the vines swinging from tree to tree formed 



 

a barrier), and, as if in graceful excuse for the inter- 
position of even these slender streams, Nature had 
lavished such growth of wild flowers and wild berries 
on the banks that it was like a garden avenue, 
through the fragrance and beauty of which we rolled, 
delighted to silence, almost to sadness. 

When we began to climb the hill to Arqua, and 
the driver stopped to breathe his horse, I got out and 
finished the easy ascent on foot. The great marvel 
to me is that the prospect of the vast plain below, on 
which, turning back, I feasted my vision, should be 
there yet, and always. It had the rare and sadden- 
ing beauty of evanescence, and awoke in me the 
memory of all beautiful scenery, so that I embroid- 
ered the landscape with the silver threads of west- 
ern streams, and bordered it with Ohio hills. Ohio 
hills ? When I looked again it was the storied Eu- 
ganean group. But what trans-oceanic bird, voyag- 
ing hither, dropped from its mouth the blackberry 
which took root and grew and blossomed and ripened, 
that I might taste Home in it on these classic hills ? 

I wonder did Petrarch walk often down this road 
from his house just above ? I figured him coming 
to meet me with his book in his hand, in his rever- 
end poetic robes, and with his laurel on, over that 
curious kind of bandaging which he seems to have 
been fond of looking, in a word, for all the world 
like the neuralgic Petrarch in the pictures. 

Drawing nearer, I discerned the apparition to be a 
robeless, laureless lout, who belonged at the village 
inn. Yet this lout, though not Petrarch, had merits. 



 

His face and hands, and his legs, as seen from his 
knees down, had the tone of the richest bronze ; he 
wore a mountain cap with a long tasseled fall to the 
back of it ; his face was comely and his eye beauti- 
ful ; and he was so nobly ignorant of every thing 
that a colt or young bullock could not have been bet- 
ter company. He merely offered to guide us to Pe- 
trarch's house, and was silent, except when spoken 
to, from that instant. 

I am here tempted to say : Arqua is in the figure 
of a man stretched upon the hill slope. The head, 
which is Petrarch's house, rests upon the summit. 
The carelessly tossed arms lie abroad from this in 
one direction, and the legs in the opposite quarter. 
It is a very lank and shambling figure, without ele- 
gance or much proportion, and the attitude is the last 
wantonness of loafing. We followed our lout up 
the right leg, which is a gentle and easy ascent in 
the general likeness of a street. World-old stone 
cottages crouch on either side ; here and there is a 
more ambitious house in decay ; trees wave over the 
street, and down its distance comes an occasional 
donkey-cart very musically and leisurely. By all 
odds, Arqua and its kind of villages are to be pre- 
ferred to those hamlets of the plain which in Italy 
cling to the white-hot highway without a tree to 
shelter them, and bake and burn there in the merci- 
less sun. Their houses of stuccoed stone are crowded 
as thickly together as city houses, and these wretched 
little villages do their worst to unite the discomforts 
of town and country with a success dreadful to think 



 

of. In all countries villages are hateful to the heart 
of civilized man. In the Lombard plains I wonder 
that one stone of them rests upon another. 

We reached Petrarch's house before the custodian 
had arrived to admit us, and stood before the high 
stone wall which shuts in the front of the house, and 
quite hides it from those without. This wall bears 
the inscription, Oasa Petrarca, and a marble tablet 
lettered to the following effect : 

SE TI AGITA 

SACRO AMOEE DI PATRIA, 

T'INCHINA A QUESTE MURA 

OVE SPIRO LA GRAND' ANIMA, 

IL CANTOR DEI SCIP1ONI 

E DI LAURA. 

Which may be translated : " If thou art stirred by 
love of country, bow to these walls, whence passed 
the great soul, the singer of the Scipios and of 
Laura." 

Meanwhile we became the centre of a group of the 
youths of Arqua, who had kindly attended our prog- 
ress in gradually increasing numbers from the moment 
we had entered the village. They were dear little 
girls and boys, and mountain babies, all with sunburnt 
faces and the gentle and the winning ways native to 
this race, which Nature loves better than us of the 
North. The blonde pilgrim seemed to please them, 
and they evidently took us for Tedeschi. You learn 
to submit to this fate in Northern Italy, however un- 
gracefully, for it is the one that constantly befalls 
you outside of the greatest cities. The people know 
but two varieties of foreigners the Englishman
