he did this : " Lisa " - he said gently, " I am 
 

afraid I must trouble you." Any thoughtful 
gentleman might have said as much ; but how 
many would have given a servant an order in 
such a tone as his ? It is not possible to 
reproduce the delicacy and chivalry of it ; as if, be 
cause she was a woman, he would have spared 
her that trifling, personal service. 

I thought of this when I heard recently the 
testimony of a refined young woman who, to 
aid herself in her education, had taken service 
in a New York family, determined to try the 
experiment of "lady help," of which the 
employer talks so much, and concerning which 
the employee is often so mysteriously silent. 
"I left the situation," she said. "The gentle 
men of the family came in and handed me their 
dripping umbrellas on a wet day without a 
glance or a word not as if I were a human 
being just as if I had been an umbrella stand. 
I could not bear it." 

Bryant said of Mr. Fields that no one could 
impress upon the people of this country so well 
as he the value and importance of the study of 
English literature. This I believe to have been 
no exaggerated view of the usefulness and 
quality of his lectures and writings. Personal 
acquaintance with him was an intellectual
privilege, of which it is impossible to speak
otherwise than gratefully. 

 

My individual debt to Mr. Fields, in respect to 
my own work, is one which I cannot and would 
not omit to acknowledge. He often helped 
me about my titles, and one of the best ever 
given to any book of mine " Men, Women, 
and Ghosts" was of his creation. In his 
fine literary judgment I had great confidence, 
and would have accepted almost any criticism 
from him trustfully. But perhaps his quick 
intuition perceived that I should be too easily 
disheartened, for I remember almost exclusively 
the pleasant, the hopeful, the appreciative words 
with which he stimulated my courage and my 
work. 

I recall an occasion when I had ventured into 
an entirely new avenue of effort, and was in 
that chaos succeeding work and preceding pub 
lication, which one may call the author's abyss, 
so hopeless was I of the success of my 
undertaking. How did he know ? for I had not 
said this to any person ; but before the article 
came out, while it was yet in press, swiftly 
came the little note : * A better paper never 
appeared in this or any other magazine ! " I 
held up my head and breathed again, until that 
dreaded and dreadful number of the " Atlantic " 
had gone by. 

I was once introduced by a clever man to a 
gentleman in these words, " Let me present 
 

to you one of your natural foes: he is a pub 
lisher." Such kindness and thoughtfulness 
as that of Mr. Fields endeared the publisher 
to his authors, and made of them his natural 
friends. 

His sense of delicacy in literary, as in all 
other matters, was of a high and fine quality. 
I remember once dining at his table with a 
public singer who, though a woman of 
irreproachable character and position, had acquired 
a little something slipshod in her way of talk 
ing ; of the sort that is common among people 
of the stage. She used a certain expression, 
perfectly simple and suitable to her view, but 
one which we were not accustomed to hear at 
that table. The face of the host, a moment 
before shining with geniality and fun, froze 
instantly. The perfect silence in which that 
unfortunate word was received, was the only 
rebuke possible under the circumstances ; but 
it was enough. The guest understood, I think ; 
though she looked as much astonished as 
embarrassed. 

Before "The Story of Avis " went to press, 
I read the manuscript to Mr. and Mrs. Fields ; 
it was the only time, I believe, that I imposed 
such a burden on these good friends. When I 
came to the chapter where Ostrander sits late 
at the piano with Barbara, while his sick wife 
 

sleeps upstairs, Mr. Fields interrupted me with 
an expression of recoil. " Oh, no ! " he cried ; 
" no, no ! Not that ! Don't introduce any 
thing of that kind ! Keep the story above 
that ! " He was appeased when I read on, 
and he learned that the worst of the situation 
consisted in the fact that Ostrander did take 
Barbara's hand. But I think his heart went 
back grudgingly to the tale which he had feared 
was about to descend into a moral quagmire ; 
and that it took him some time to recover his 
trust in it. In the end, I hope he did. 

His was a rich life, and his a rare home. 
There has been no other in America quite like 
it. Those of us who received its hospitality 
recall its inspiration among the treasures of our 
lives. We think of the peaceful library into 
which the sunset over the Charles looked 
delicately, while the "best things" of thought 
were given and taken by the finest and 
strongest minds of the day in a kind of electric 
interplay, which makes by contrast a pale affair of 
the word conversation as we are apt to use it. 
We recall the quiet guest-chamber, apart from 
the noise of the street, and lifted far above the 
river ; that room opulent and subtle with the 
astral shapes of past occupants, Longfellow, 
W T hittier, Dickens, Thackeray, Mrs. Stowe, 
Kingsley, and the rest of their high order 




and always resounding softly to the fine ear 
with the departed tread of Hawthorne, who 
used to pace the floor on sleepless nights. We
