As she spoke, Mrs. Minot moved quietly about the room, pinning the pages
of several illustrated papers against the wall at the foot of the bed,
and placing to the best advantage the other comforts she had brought.

“Keep up your heart, neighbor. I have an idea in my head which I think
will help us all, if I can carry it out,” she said, cheerily, as she
went, leaving Mrs. Pecq to sew on Jack’s new night-gowns, with swift
fingers, and the grateful wish that she might work for these good
friends forever.

As if the whispering and rustling had disturbed her, Jill soon began to
stir, and slowly opened the eyes which had closed so wearily on the
dull December afternoon. The bare wall with its brown spiders no longer
confronted her, but the colored print of a little girl dancing to the
tune her father was playing on a guitar, while a stately lady, with
satin dress, ruff, and powder, stood looking on, well pleased. The
quaint figure, in its belaced frock, quilted petticoat, and red-heeled
shoes, seemed to come tripping toward her in such a life-like way,
that she almost saw the curls blow back, heard the rustle of the rich
brocade, and caught the sparkle of the little maid’s bright eyes.

“Oh, how pretty! Who sent them?” asked Jill, eagerly, as her eye glanced
along the wall, seeing other new and interesting things beyond: an
elephant-hunt, a ship in full sail, a horse-race, and a ball-room.

“The good fairy who never comes empty-handed. Look round a bit and you
will see more pretties all for you, my dearie;” and her mother pointed
to a bunch of purple grapes in a green leaf plate, a knot of bright
flowers pinned on the white curtain, and a gay little double gown across
the foot of the bed.

Jill clapped her hands, and was enjoying her new pleasures, when in came
Merry and Molly Loo, with Boo, of course, trotting after her like a fat
and amiable puppy. Then the good times began; the gown was put on, the
fruit tasted, and the pictures were studied like famous works of art.

“It’s a splendid plan to cover up that hateful wall. I’d stick pictures
all round and have a gallery. That reminds me! Up in the garret at our
house is a box full of old fashion-books my aunt left. I often look at
them on rainy days, and they are very funny. I’ll go this minute and
get every one. We can pin them up, or make paper dolls;” and away rushed
Molly Loo, with the small brother waddling behind, for, when he lost
sight of her, he was desolate indeed.

The girls had fits of laughter over the queer costumes of years gone
by, and put up a splendid procession of ladies in full skirts, towering
hats, pointed slippers, powdered hair, simpering faces, and impossible
waists.

“I do think this bride is perfectly splendid, the long train and veil
are so sweet,” said Jill, revelling in fine clothes as she turned from
one plate to another.

“I like the elephants best, and I’d give anything to go on a hunt like
that!” cried Molly Loo, who rode cows, drove any horse she could get,
had nine cats, and was not afraid of the biggest dog that ever barked.

“I fancy ‘The Dancing Lesson;’ it is so sort of splendid, with the great
windows, gold chairs, and fine folks. Oh, I would like to live in
a castle with a father and mother like that,” said Merry, who was
romantic, and found the old farmhouse on the hill a sad trial to her
high-flown ideas of elegance.

“Now, that ship, setting out for some far-away place, is more to my
mind. I weary for home now and then, and mean to see it again some
day;” and Mrs. Pecq looked longingly at the English ship, though it was
evidently outward bound. Then, as if reproaching herself for discontent,
she added: “It looks like those I used to see going off to India with a
load of missionaries. I came near going myself once, with a lady bound
for Siam; but I went to Canada with her sister, and here I am.”

“I’d like to be a missionary and go where folks throw their babies to
the crocodiles. I’d watch and fish them out, and have a school, and
bring them up, and convert all the people till they knew better,” said
warm-hearted Molly Loo, who befriended every abused animal and forlorn
child she met.

“We needn’t go to Africa to be missionaries; they have ‘em nearer home
and need ‘em, too. In all the big cities there are a many, and they have
their hands full with the poor, the wicked, and the helpless. One can
find that sort of work anywhere, if one has a mind,” said Mrs. Pecq.

“I wish we had some to do here. I’d so like to go round with baskets
of tea and rice, and give out tracts and talk to people. Wouldn’t you,
girls?” asked Molly, much taken with the new idea.

“It would be rather nice to have a society all to ourselves, and have
meetings and resolutions and things,” answered Merry, who was fond of
little ceremonies, and always went to the sewing circle with her mother.

“We wouldn’t let the boys come in. We’d have it a secret society, as
they do their temperance lodge, and we’d have badges and pass-words
and grips. It would be fun if we can only get some heathen to work at!”
 cried Jill, ready for fresh enterprises of every sort.

“I can tell you someone to begin on right away,” said her mother,
nodding at her. “As wild a little savage as I’d wish to see. Take her
in hand, and make a pretty-mannered lady of her. Begin at home, my lass,
and you’ll find missionary work enough for a while.”

“Now, Mammy, you mean me! Well, I will begin; and I’ll be so good, folks
won’t know me. Being sick makes naughty children behave in story-books,
I’ll see if live ones can’t;” and Jill put on such a sanctified face
that the girls laughed and asked for their missions also, thinking they
would be the same.

“You, Merry, might do a deal at home helping mother, and setting the big
brothers a good example. One little girl in a house can do pretty much
as she will, especially if she has a mind to make plain things nice and
comfortable, and not long for castles before she knows how to do her own
tasks well,” was the first unexpected reply.

Merry colored, but took the reproof sweetly, resolving to do what she
could, and surprised to find how many ways seemed open to her after a
few minutes’ thought.

“Where shall I begin? I’m not afraid of a dozen crocodiles after Miss
Bat;” and Molly Loo looked about her with a fierce air, having had
practice in battles with the old lady who kept her father’s house.

“Well, dear, you haven’t far to look for as nice a little heathen as
you’d wish;” and Mrs. Pecq glanced at Boo, who sat on the floor staring
hard at them, attracted by the dread word “crocodile.” He had a cold and
no handkerchief, his little hands were red with chilblains, his clothes
shabby, he had untidy darns in the knees of his stockings, and a head of
tight curls that evidently had not been combed for some time.

“Yes, I know he is, and I try to keep him decent, but I forget, and he
hates to be fixed, and Miss Bat doesn’t care, and father laughs when I
talk about it.”

Poor Molly Loo looked much ashamed as she made excuses, trying at the
same time to mend matters by seizing Boo and dusting him all over with
her handkerchief, giving a pull at his hair as if ringing bells, and
then dumping him down again with the despairing exclamation: “Yes, we’re
a pair of heathens, and there’s no one to save us if I don’t.”

That was true enough; for Molly’s father was a busy man, careless of
everything but his mills, Miss Bat was old and lazy, and felt as if
she might take life easy after serving the motherless children for many
