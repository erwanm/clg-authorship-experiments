“No, I’m bound to say they’re not,” said the Professor’s wife candidly.
“Your daughter,” she added, in a low tone for all to hear, “decides that
question.”

“I’m so glad you said that, Mrs. Saintsbury,” said the young man. He
looked at the girl; who blushed with a pleasure that seemed to thrill to
the last fibre of her pretty costume.

She could not say anything, but her mother asked, with an effort at
self-denial: “Do you think so really? It’s one of those London things.
They have so much taste there now,” she added yielding to her own pride
in the dress.

“Yes; I supposed it must be,” said Mrs. Saintsbury, “We used to come in
muslins and tremendous hoops--don’t you remember?”

“Did you look like your photographs?” asked young Mavering, over his
shoulder.

“Yes; but we didn’t know it then,” said the Professor’s wife.

“Neither did we,” said the Professor. “We supposed that there had never
been anything equal to those hoops and white muslins.”

“Thank you, my dear,” said his wife, tapping him between the shoulders
with her fan. “Now don’t go any further.”

“Do you mean about our first meeting here on Class Day?” asked her
husband.

“They’ll think so now,” said Mrs. Saintsbury patiently, with a playful
threat of consequences in her tone.

“When I first saw the present Mrs. Saintsbury,” pursued the
Professor--it was his joking way, of describing her, as if there had
been several other Mrs. Saintsburys--“she was dancing on the green
here.”

“Ah, they don’t dance on the green any more, I hear,” sighed Mrs.
Pasmer.

“No, they don’t,” said the other lady; “and I think it’s just as well.
It was always a ridiculous affectation of simplicity.”

“It must have been rather public,” said young Mavering, in a low voice,
to Miss Pasmer.

“It doesn’t seem as if it could ever have been in character quite,” she
answered.

“We’re a thoroughly indoors people,” said the Professor. “And it seems
as if we hadn’t really begun to get well as a race till we had come in
out of the weather.”

“How can you say that on a day like this?” cried Mrs. Pasmer. “I didn’t
suppose any one could be so unromantic.”

“Don’t flatter him,” cried his wife.

“Does he consider that a compliment?”

“Not personally,” he answered: “But it’s the first duty of a Professor
of Comparative Literature to be unromantic.”

“I don’t understand,” faltered Mrs. Pasmer.

“He will be happy to explain, at the greatest possible length,” said
Mrs. Saintsbury. “But you shan’t spoil our pleasure now, John.”

They all laughed, and the Professor looked proud of the wit at his
expense; the American husband is so, and the public attitude of the
American husband and wife toward each other is apt to be amiably
satirical; their relation seems never to have lost its novelty, or to
lack droll and surprising contrasts for them.

Besides these passages with her husband, Mrs. Saintsbury kept up a full
flow of talk with the elder Mavering, which Mrs. Pasmer did her best to
overhear, for it related largely to his son, whom, it seemed, from the
father’s expressions, the Saintsburys had been especially kind to.

“No, I assure you,” Mrs. Pasmer heard her protest, “Mr. Saintsbury has,
been very much interested in him. I hope he has not put any troublesome
ideas into his head. Of course he’s very much interested in literature,
from his point of view, and he’s glad to find any of the young men
interested in it, and that’s apt to make him overdo matters a little.”

“Dan wished me to talk with him, and I shall certainly be glad to do
so,” said the father, but in a tone which conveyed to Mrs. Pasmer the
impression that though he was always open to conviction, his mind was
made up on this point, whatever it was.




VI.

The party went to half a dozen spreads, some of which were on a scale
of public grandeur approaching that of the Gymnasium, and others of
a subdued elegance befitting the more private hospitalities in the
students’ rooms. Mrs. Pasmer was very much interested in these rooms,
whose luxurious appointments testified to the advance of riches and
of the taste to apply them since she used to visit students’ rooms in
far-off Class Days. The deep window nooks and easy-chairs upholstered
in the leather that seems sacred alike to the seats and the shelves of
libraries; the aesthetic bookcases, low and topped with bric-a-brac; the
etchings and prints on the walls, which the elder Mavering went up to
look at with a mystifying air of understanding such things; the foils
crossed over the chimney, and the mantel with its pipes, and its
photographs of theatrical celebrities tilted about over it--spoke of
conditions mostly foreign to Mrs. Pasmer’s memories of Harvard. The
photographed celebrities seemed to be chosen chiefly for their beauty,
and for as much of their beauty as possible, Mrs. Pasmer perceived, with
an obscure misgiving of the sort which an older generation always likes
to feel concerning the younger, but with a tolerance, too, which was
personal to herself; it was to be considered that the massive thought
and honest amiability of Salvini’s face, and the deep and spiritualized
power of Booth’s, varied the effect of these companies of posturing
nymphs.

At many places she either met old friends with whom she clamoured over
the wonder of their encounter there, or was made acquainted with new
people by the Saintsburys. She kept a mother’s eye on her daughter, to
whom young Mavering presented everybody within hail or reach, and
whom she could see, whenever she looked at her, a radiant centre of
admiration. She could hear her talk sometimes, and she said to herself
that really Alice was coming out; she had never heard her say so many
good things before; she did not know it was in her. She was very
glad then that she had let her wear that dress; it was certainly
distinguished, and the girl carried it off, to her mother’s amusement,
with the air of a superb lady of the period from which it dated. She
thought what a simple child Alice really was, all the time those other
children, the Seniors, were stealing their glances of bold or timid
worship at her, and doubtless thinking her a brilliant woman of the
world. But there could be no mistake that she was a success.

Part of her triumph was of course due to Mrs. Saintsbury; whose
chaperonage; Mrs. Pasmer could see, was everywhere of effect. But it
was also largely due to the vigilant politeness of young Mavering, who
seemed bent on making her have good time, and who let no chance slip
him. Mrs. Pasmer felt his kindness truly; and she did not feel it the
