passion for Clementina was at its height. She had 
Maddalena bring her out early in the evening, and 
made her dress under her own eye and her French 
maid s, while Maddalena went back to comfort Mrs. 
Lander. 

" I hated to leave her," said Clementina. " I don 't 
believe she 's very well." 

"Isn 't she always ill?" demanded Miss Milray. 
She embraced the girl again, as if once were not 
enough. " Clementina, if Mrs. Lander won 't give you 
to me, I 'm going to steal you. Do you know what I 
want you to do to-night ? I want you to stand up 
with me, and receive, till the dancing begins, as if it 
were your coming-out. I mean to introduce every 
body to you. You 'll be easily the prettiest girl, 
there, and you 'll have the nicest gown, and I don 't 
mean that any of your charms shall be thrown away. 
You won 't be frightened ? " 

" No, I don 't believe I shall," said Clementina. 
" You can tell me what to do." 

The dress she wore was of pale green, like the light 
seen in thin woods; out of it shone her white shoul 
ders, and her young face, as if rising through the 
verdurous light. The artists, to a man and woman, 
wished to paint her, and severally told her so, during 
the evening which lasted till morning. She was not 
surprised when Lord Lioncourt appeared, toward 
midnight, and astonished Miss Milray by claiming 
acquaintance with Clementina. He asked about Mrs. 
Lander, and whether she had got to Florence without 
losing the way ; he laughed but he seemed really to 


care. lie took Clementina out to supper, when the 
time came; and she would have topped him by half a 
head as she leaned on his arm, if she had not consid 
erately drooped and trailed a little after him. 

She could not know what a triumph he was making 
for her ; and it was merely part of the magic of the 
time that Mr. Ewins should come in presently with 
one of the ladies, lie had arrived in Florence that 
day, and had to be brought unasked. He put on the 
effect of an old friend with her ; but Clementina 's 
curiosity was chiefly taken with a tall American, whom 
she thought very handsome. His light yellow hair 
was brushed smooth across his forehead like a \vell- 
behaving boy 's ; he was dressed like the other men, 
but he seemed not quite happy in his evening coat, 
and his gloves which he smote together uneasily from

time to time. He appeared to think that somehow 
the radiant Clementina would know how he felt; he 
did not dance, and he professed to have found him 
self at the party by a species of accident. He told 
her that he was out in Europe looking after a patent 
right that he had just taken hold of, and was having 
only a middling good time. He pretended surprise 
to hear her say that she was having a first-rate time, 
and he tried to reason her out of it. He confessed 
that from the moment he came into the room he 
had made up his mind to take her to supper, and 
had never been so disgusted in his life as when he

saw that little lord toddling off with her, and trying 
to look as large as life. He asked her what a lord 
was like, anyway, and he made her laugh all the time. 



 

He told her his name, G. W. Hinkle, and asked 
whether she would be likely to remember it if they 
ever met again. 

Another man who interested her very much was a 
young Russian, with curling hair and neat, small feat 
ures who spoke better English than she did, and said 
he was going to be a writer, but had not yet decided 
whether to write in Russian or French ; she sup 
posed he had wanted her advice, but he did not wait 
for it, or seem to expect it. He was very much 
in earnest, while he fanned her, and his earnestness 
amused her as much as the American 's irony. He 
asked which city of America she came from, and 
when she said none, he asked which part of America. 
She answered New England, and he said, " Oh, yes, 
that is where they have the conscience." She did not 
know what he meant, and he put before her the ideal 
of New England girlhood which he had evolved from 
reading American novels. " Are you like that ? " he 
demanded. 

She laughed, and said, " Not a bit," and asked him 
if he had ever met such an American girl, and he said, 
frankly, No ; the American girls were all mercenary, 
and cared for nothing but money, or marrying titles. 
He added that he had a title, but he would not wear it. 

Clementina said she did not believe she cared for 
titles, and then he said, " But you care for money." 
She denied it, but as if she had confessed it, he went 
on : " The only American that I have seen with that 
conscience was a man. I will tell you of him, if you 
wish." 



 

He did not wait for her answer. " It was in Naples 
at Pompeii. I saw at the first glance that he was 
different from other Americans, and I resolved to 
know him. He was there in company with a stupid 
boy, whose tutor he was ; and he told me that he was 
studying to be a minister of the Protestant church. 
Next year he will go home to be consecrated. He 
promised to pass through Florence in the spring, and 
he will keep his word. Every act, every word, every 
thought of his is regulated by conscience. It is ter 
rible, but it is beautiful." All the time, the Russian 
was fanning Clementina, with every outward appear 
ance of flirtation. " Will you dance again ? No ? I 
should like to draw such a character as his in a ro-
