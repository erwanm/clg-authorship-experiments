"You must then have heard of St. Victor before starting."

"Yes."

"Yet I fancy it is so obscure that its existence can be known to very
few in the great city."

"I presume you are right. I was recommended to come here by a friend."

"Ah!" commented James Sinclair, beginning to think he was right, though
it seemed to him very strange that Mr. Wainwright should have selected
so young a messenger. "I should like to see New York once more."

"Who wouldn't?" interposed Bowman impatiently. "In New York you can
live. Here in St. Victor one can only vegetate."

"Don't you expect to go back to New York some day, Mr. Sinclair?" asked
Fred.

"I don't know; I hope so."

"When our business in Canada is completed," said Bowman, "we shall
probably both go back."

"Are you going to sleep here to-night, Bowman?" asked Sinclair.

"No, I think not. I have taken a room in the hotel."

"You must do as you like, of course, but it is lonely for me. Besides I
might need assistance."

"Let the girl stay here, then. I should make a miserable sick nurse. I
will ask young Fenton, here, if it is reasonable to expect me to bury
myself in such a cheerless place when it will do no good."

Fred was disgusted with the man's selfishness. "If I had a friend
sick," he said, "I think I would be quite willing to keep him company."

"You say so now, but wait till the time comes."

"Your words, Mr. Fenton," said Sinclair, "embolden me to ask you a
favor."

"Name it," said Fred, in a tone of kindly encouragement.

"I spend all my time alone, except when Claudine is ministering to my
wants. Your time is hardly likely to be very much occupied in this dull
place. Can't you spare me an hour or two at your convenience during the
day?"

"You have promised to go hunting with me tomorrow," interrupted Bowman.

"That is true. I will go with you in the forenoon, and in the afternoon
I will call on Mr. Sinclair."

Bowman shrugged his shoulders.

"It is a rash promise. You will be sorry for having made it."

"I will risk that," answered Fred.

Sinclair gave him a grateful glance. The promise cheered him, and
kindled hopes in his breast. Now he would have a chance of learning,
when alone with Fred, whether he came as a messenger from Mr.
Wainwright. If so, and through his means he could make restitution and
regain his place and lost character, he would still have something to
live for. He execrated his folly in weakly submitting to the guidance
of Paul Bowman, and for having taken that first step in crime, which is
so difficult to retrace.

"Don't forget your promise," he said earnestly as Fred rose to go.

"I won't fail you," replied Fred quietly.

"You're in for it now," remarked Bowman, as they started to walk home.
"You might as well turn sick nurse at once as give up your time to
Sinclair."

"I might be sick sometime myself," said Fred, "and in that case I
should be sorry to be left alone."

"Oh, well, suit yourself," said Bowman carelessly. "I'd rather it would
be you than me, for that matter. I shall expect you to go out to the
woods with me in the forenoon."

"All right!"

"Well," thought Fred, as he slipped into bed at ten o'clock, "I've made
a beginning. I have formed the acquaintance of both parties to the
robbery. The next step will be more difficult."



CHAPTER XXX.

A HUNTING EXCURSION.

Fred did not rise till eight o'clock the next morning. He was fatigued
by his long journey, and slept late. When he descended, he found Bowman
seated at the breakfast-table.

"I got ahead of you," said Bowman.

"How long have you been down-stairs?"

"About ten minutes."

"Are we likely to have a good day for hunting?"

"Good enough," answered Bowman, indifferently. "I am not an
enthusiastic sportsman. I only take to it to fill up a part of my time.
It is about the only thing I can do in this dull hole."

"You might read. I brought two or three novels in my valise, and will
lend yon one if you care for it."

"I don't care for reading. Stories tire me. I used to read the daily
papers in New York, but can't get hold of any here New York dailies, I
mean. I don't care for Canadian papers unless they contain news from
New York."

"I have with me the Tribune, World, and Sun, of day before
yesterday."

"I should like to see them," said Bowman, eagerly. "If you will bring
them down, I will look over them in the woods."

"All right! I am glad I saved them. I had a mind to throw them away, or
leave them in the car."

The breakfast was plain, but Fred and Bowman, who were the only guests,
were not difficult to suit.

Ten minutes later they were on their way to the woods. They went across
the fields, taking a footpath trodden in the snow, which materially
shortened the distance. But even tramping this far tired Bowman, and
when they reached a small rock that cropped out from the expanse of
white, he declared that he must rest awhile.

He took a seat on the bowlder and began to read one of the papers he
