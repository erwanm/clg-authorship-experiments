ding." 

"And the gift of Sherburne House, and the baby's 
birth, and our own wedding. All those times are 
crowded with tenderest remembrances. And Sherburne 
expressed one hope, or half prediction that when he was 
elderly and had made fame and money and Sherburne 
House came to him, he should go there and live, and be 
a sort of country benefactor, take up the work Doctor 
Underwood would lay down." 

"That is a delightful plan," exclaimed Dell, her eyes 
alight with emotion and interest. 

" He won't achieve it, I am afraid. I am really trou- 
bled about this new plan. He went wild you know over 
languages and literature and would go abroad. What- 
ever gave him this fancy — he entertained it before he 
came home and has been studying up a little. I do not 
want his father to think I persuaded him. Leonard's 
heart was set upon his studying law." 

"I think medicine grander, higher." 

"For some men — yes. Yet I think a lawyer oftener 
comes up to the fine places in public life. And I am 
sorry to have Len disappointed. Then too, there would 
be such an excellent connection for a young fellow to 
step into. However, Sherburne may change his mind." 

" But I do like his ideal." 

"I wonder — " Bertram Carew studied his wife's face 
with a half nervous scrutiny. 

"O, you needn't tell me," she responded, laughingly. 
"When you say 'wonder ' in that tone, I know it means 
'will you never be sorry that one of our boys is not 
going back to the old home to be Sherburne of Sher- 





burne House ? ' Would you take it back on the possi- 
bility?" 

"A thousand times no. I aided and abetted you. I 
think I asked it of you as a preliminary to marriage." 
There was a gleam of amusement in his eyes. "My 
dear Lyndell, Leonard's love for the place and care of it 
is enough to reward us both. Who could have made 
Aunt Amelia so happy, and given Cousin Carrick just 
that kind of home for her declining years ! Our destiny 
lay in a different direction. Our boys will have a wide 
range to choose from. And Sherburne's dream is like 
the happy ending of a delightful romance. But it is a 
long way from twenty to fifty, and ideals change." 

" But you will do your best for him ? " anxiously. 

"As if he was my own son, — if he comes back in the 
autumn of the same mind." 

" You do not quite trust him." 

" His temperament is a little volatile. What seems 
like strength may be an eager desire to please one's self. 
He is a handsome, attractive fellow, and doesn't appear 
to have acquired any vices, one of the young men who 
will be a general favorite with society and that the world 
will judge leniently. Do you want me to express any 
more admiration for the heir of Sherburne ? ' ' 

"You have been very generous," returned Lyndell, 
smilingly. " O, how strange it seems with all these 
little children growing up to men and women ! When 
the first person gave birth to the aphorism that 'Child- 
hood was the happiest time of life,' he should have added 
'to the parents.' You do not have to think what you 
shall do with them, nor feel afraid of some unreason- 
able love affair. O, I am glad that I have a few more 
years of grace." 





Doctor Carew bent over and kissed his wife. 

"It is quite ridiculous to think of sons-in-law, and 
daughters-in-law. I am afraid I shall not be able to 
select as wisely as dear father did. ' His little girl.' I 
think that is in some old letters." 

The soft tears flooded Lyndell's eyes. Yes, that had 
been a happy time in spite of its sorrows and her first 
dreadful summer at Sherburne House. She had been 
the child of the father's love before she had been the 
son's wife. 

There began preparations for the home-going. Edward 
Beaumanoir would spend another week in the city, and 
he had half a mind to go to Labrador with Professor 
Kenneth, but Sherburne persuaded him to come to them 
for a visit, and he did owe his father some respect. Mrs. 
Osborne begged the Carew twins, as they were all eager- 
ness to see the younger Beaumanoir cousins. 

It was quite lonely when they had gone. But there 
were to be summer plans for the others. 

" I think we shall have to own an island or a hotel," 
declared Mr. Drayton, humorously. "There are so 
many of us, and we agree so well together that we might 
start a regular colony." 



CHAPTER V. 

IN THE BOSOM OF THE FAMILY. 

GERTRUDE MAURICE started homeward with a 
variety of emotions. She longed to see the house- 
hold, yet she shrank from the first meeting. She had 
changed greatly she knew. The littleness of everything 
would stifle her. 

Yet why should her broader, truer outlook lead to any 
diminution of affection ? Had they truly loved each 
other ? She had cared most for Agnes and her father, 
but her father was so different from these other fathers, 
who took such exquisite interest in their children. It 
made her heart ache. It also made her frightened and 
ashamed. 

Agnes had married Mr. Rowdon early in the winter. 
Gertrude would have liked her to be more frank and
