"The name?"

"Clyde Blacklock; and he wants to come on board."

"Has he been instructed in the Rule of Three?" which meant the three
clauses of the obligation.

"Ay, ay, sir."

"Let him in."

The R. P. F. and the L. P. F. went out, and soon returned with Clyde
Blacklock between them. On his head, and drawn entirely over it, was a
white cap. A yard of cotton cloth had been purchased at Helsingfors,
which had been sewed up like a meal bag. This was pulled down over the
candidate's face, and the square end of it hung down in front of him,
having upon it, in letters cut out of black cloth, and sewed upon the
cotton, the mysterious device AT-VI., which, however, did not relate to
"Plantation Bitters."

"Hah! You have caught him!" exclaimed the C. B., in the most savage of
tones.

"Ay, ay, sir! We captured him outside, and in spite of his frantic
struggles, have brought him before you to be examined," replied the R.
P. F.

"What is he?" demanded Scott, in gruff notes.

"A vile Indian."

"Hah!"

"A 'ticklarly vile Indian."

"When was he caught?"

"At six."

"Has he been searched?"

"Not yet."

"Does he confess?"

"Not yet."

"Clyde Blacklock, answer me truly," said Scott, solemnly. "Did you
steal it?"

"Answer him," said the candidate's conductor, in a low voice.

"Steal what?" asked Clyde.

"The bag out of which a faithless Brother of the Most Respectable Order
of Bangwhangers let the cat," added the C. B., tragically.

"No, I didn't."

"Let him be searched!" continued Scott, in a sepulchral tone.

Whereupon the officers, who had silently gathered around the candidate,
began to punch him in the ribs, and under the ears, not to hurt, but
only to tickle him. As Clyde was sensitive in this direction, as almost
anybody would be when taken by surprise, the effect was very decided,
and the candidate wriggled, and squirmed, and roared.

"He has it I We have found it upon him!" said the R. P. F., suddenly.

"Hah!" cried Scott. "The vile Indian is guilty."

"Guilty!" responded all the other officers.

"Does he see it?" demanded the C. B.

"He don't see it."

"Let him see it!"

Then the R. P. F. and the L. P. F. seized the white cap by the corners,
and jerked it violently from Clyde's head, and laid it on the floor
before him, with the letters right side up to him. All the officers
pointed at the cap, with the most extravagant expressions of surprise
and indignation upon their faces.

"Behold the bag!" exclaimed the group, in concert.

"And it has our mark upon it," replied Scott, with indignation in
his looks and tones. Then suddenly changing his voice and manner,
he continued, very gently, "Brother Blacklock, this degree is
founded upon the story of a vile Indian in the wilds of America.
Some emigrants were travelling over the prairies of the great west,
intending to settle in Nevada. One of them had a favorite Maltese cat,
of which the whole party were very fond. They were very much afraid
of losing the creature, and for greater security they carried her in
a bag,--precisely like that just found upon you,--bearing upon it
the initials of the owner's name, which was, in full, Andrew Thomas
Vincent Iverson. For a guide they had a vile Indian, who, like all
vile Indians, was very fond of whiskey. One night this vile Indian was
particularly 'dry.' and wanted to 'wet his whistle' with fire-water.
After the emigrants had gone to sleep, he searched the camp for some
of his favorite beverage. He came across the bag containing the
Maltese cat. As the contents thereof seemed to be lively, he thought
it contained a bottle of whiskey. He opened the bag, and the cat
leaped out, not whiskey; in other words, he let the cat out of the
bag--at all times a very grave and terrible offence. When he saw what
he had done, he was alarmed, and concealed the bag within his clothes,
intending to make the emigrants believe that the cat had run away,
carrying the bag with her. But, vile Indian that he was, his employers
suspected him, and punching him in the ribs, they discovered the bag.
Then they knew that he had let the cat out of the bag, and as the
penalty of his crime, they compelled him to eat Bologna sausage until
he couldn't help barking. Brother Blacklock, this solemn ceremony is
intended to convince you that, should you ever let the cat out of the
bag, you will be subjected to the same penalty as the vile Indian, who
was A 'Ticklarly Vile Indian. This bag bears our mark,--AT-VI.,--which
relates to the hour you were caught--at six. It also means A 'Ticklarly
Vile Indian, and alludes, besides, to the rallying number of our
order--AT., eighty; VI., six. Brother Blacklock, it is your next move.
Take a seat where you find one."

"This will never do," interposed the D. C. B. "Some of the members will
die of old age before we can give them the second degree at this rate."

"I was thinking of that myself," replied Scott; "and I have the remedy.
We will go through the first part with the candidates singly, and
explain the meaning of it to the crowd all together. Then it won't take
two minutes apiece."

"Right, Most Respectable C. B.," replied the D. C. B.

Another "vile Indian" was easily captured outside of the fish-house,
and was passed through the same ceremony. He was duly tickled till he
rolled on the ground, pronounced guilty of stealing the bag, allowed
to see it; and when the mark upon it was indignantly identified, the
candidate was sent to a seat. About twenty went through this part of
the performance, and then, when all of them were placed in front of
the C. B., he told them the story of "A 'Ticklarly Vile Indian." All
of them were solemnly warned not to let the cat out of the bag; and in
closing the lodge, those who had just been "elevated" to the second
