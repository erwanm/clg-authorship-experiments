cabin-boy. Such horror seized me at this dreadful ide 
that I almost lost my courage and presence of mind. In 
this extremity I turned to God, and begged him as fer- 
vently as I could, not to permit such a horrible crime ; I 
then addressed my men, who were actually preparing to 
kill the cabin-boy, with all the earnestness, and with the 
most touching words at my command : 

"Friends, what are you about to do ? Do you not recoil 
from such a crime? Turn your thoughts to God; he 
will look in mercy upon you, and deliver you from this 
dreadful temptation, for we cannot be far from land." 

Then I showed them on the chart which I had cut on 
the deck, the spot where I believed we were, but they 
replied that I had said the same thing for many days, and 
deceived them with hopes that were never realized ; they 
could not tell whether I was deceived myself, or was only 
bent upon deceiving them. Spite of these threatening 



 

speeclies, they consentedj at my entreaty, to wait for three 
days, but swore to carry out their cruel determination if 
help did not appear at the end of that time. This decis- 
ion almost broke my heart. I redoubled my prayers, and 
implored God to have pity upon us and prevent the com- 
mission of such a crime. In the meanwhile the time flew 
by, and our hunger and thirst were so intense that they 
could scarcely be endured. 

" Ail," cried some, " if we were only on land, we could 
at least eat grass like the cattle." 

From this, one can form some idea of our fierce hunger; 
I tried to cheer up the men with the most encouraging 
words that I could think of Hope, which was decreasing 
rapidly in my breast, still sustained me, and although my 
wounds had weakened me much, and still pained me, I 
was among the strongest, and could still walk from one 
end to the other of the boat, while many could not stir 
from the spot where they were lying. 

Thirteen days had passed since the shipwreck, and our 
hope of reaching the coast of Sumatra, which I had not 
thought far distant, grew every hour more indistinct. All 
declared that our thirst was no longer to be borne, when 
the weather grew cloudy and rain began to fall; we imme- 
diately spread out the sail and laid down upon the deck 
to catch every drop that we could in our mouths, while we 
filled our casks as before. 

I was steering the vessel at this time, and according to 
my calculations, we were very near land ; I hoped that the 
weather would clear up, but it continued to rain so vio- 
lently, and I was so cold and wet that I could hold out no 



 

longer. I called to one of the sailors to relieve me, and 
crept under the deck to warm me.

"Land! land! Friends, we are close to the coast," 
suddenly cried the steersman, before he had been more 
than an hour at the helm, quite beside himself With joy. 

The land which we should have discovered much sooner 
in clear weather, lay really just before us, and it was a 
pleasure to see how all immediately aroused themselves, 
and came eagerly forward to see how far distant it was 
and how soon we could reach it. We spread all sail that 
we might arrive before nightfall. As we approached we 
perceived that the breakers were too strong to admit of 
our weathering them, and we discovered a little island 
where was a small bay, in which we cast anchor. The 
starved crew, gathering together all their remaining 
strength, sprang on shore, and distributed themselves 
every where, in search of something to eat; I threw 
myself upon the ground, kissed it, and gave thanks to 
God for his timely ?iid, and for having shielded us from the 
commission of so foul a crime as the men would have per- 
petrated on the following day, for this was the last of the 
days that they had promised to wait, and the cabin boy 
would have been killed on the morrow. 

We found an abundance of cocoanuts on the island, but 
no sweet water ; we were, however, quite satisfied with the 
refreshing juice of the youngest and tenderest nuts, while 
the harder ones served us for meat. We indulged too freely 
in this delicious food after our long fast, and were extremely 




ill the next day ; we rolled on the ground and shrieked 
with agony; but it did not last long, and on the following 
morning we were well again. 

We explored the island but found no food but cocoanuts, 
and encountered quite a large serpent ; we saw no human 
beings, but found traces of vessels having touched there. 
As it could not be far from Sumatra, according to our cal- 
culations, we loaded our vessel with cocoanuts and set sail 
again towards evening. The next morning, Sumatra lay 
in sight, and with a favourable breeze we bore down upon 
the coast and sailed along, looking for a harbor where we 
might land, until our provision of nuts was exhausted. 
Then, as the breakers seemed every where too strong to 
trust ourselves to them, it was decided that four or five of 
the best swimmers should attempt to reach the shore, and 
search more narrowly for a good landing place. This plan 
succeeded, and they soon arrived upon the shore of a river 
where they gave us the signal agreed upon.; we steered in 
that direction, but just at the mouth of the river there 
was a sand-bank, upon which the waves broke with great 
fury. 

" Friends," I cried, " I cannot undertake to land here 
without your unanimous consent and co-operation, for if 
the boat strikes, which is quite possible, I cannot bear the 
blame alone." 

I then asked them for their advice ; they had but one 
opinion â€” it was best to attempt the landing. 

" Well, then," I replied, " if you are all willing, I am 
ready to share the danger with you." 

I then placed myself at the helm, and prepared to eut
