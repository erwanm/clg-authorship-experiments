that meant Olympus and the sight of the goddess face to face. 
But here in this modern day the face of things was broken 
up into little facets, and sometimes they reflect one light, 
sometimes another, until we tire of them and long for the 
russet peace of autumn days. But out of this bog he had to 
flounder if he was to get anywhere at all. 



 





" Don't tell me I love folks," he said whimsically. "I just 
feel kindly toward 'em. That's all that 's left in us when 
we 're tending toward fifty.' 

" It ought not to be all that 's left," she cried, with her old 
wildness of rebuttal. " Things ought to go on to be more 
and more." 

" But they don't, child, they don't. You might as well say 
my eyes ought to be sharper and sharper — but they 're not. 
I use glasses, and when I lose 'em I swear damnably because 
I can't see a page." 

Catherine remembered a solemn word used a great deal in 
the lectures and reading she loved. 

" You talk," she said, " as if the soul didn't exist." 

" No, I don't. Be whipped if I do," said Winterbourne. 
He ran his eloquent fingers through his brush of curling hair. 
He was now defending what he believed in and what he did 
love. " But the soul looks through a great many windows 
here. It sees a good many colors. It's haunted by strange 
odors — the ships that come from far. Cat — the souls that 
sail in from other planets. They bring these things. The 
soul, she sits there and looks out ; but what she sees she 
doesn't want to possess, not if she's been looking out a good 
long time. Catherine, I am forty-six years old. I 'm as gnarled 
as an apple tree. Don't you act as if I were a lilac in bloom. 
I'm not." 

Most of this was misty enough to her, but she returned 
to the question in hand. 

" I can't help it," she said. "You look at Bess as if she 
were another lilac-bush in bloom. You love to have her in 
the room with you. You turn to her for every single thing 
you want." 

" Why, God bless me, of course I do ! " said Winterbourne, 
in an extreme of irritation. " It 's like having a bunch of roses 



 





in the room. Besides, she understands me. I understand hen 
The girl 's as immediate to me as my own hand." 

Then he saw what he had done. Catherine got up, and 
stood a moment, her white face toward him. The eyes did 
not seem to reproach him, or to bid him mark their dis- 
tended misery. 

" Good-night," she said, 
f She seemed to melt away. Wintcrbournc sat there looking 
into the grate where the fire might have been. He was dis- 
gusted, all through, with his rash habit of speech, with a life 
that so classified as to leave the unclassified no chance to 
exist in decency. 

"There 's something," he said, "to spoil every damned 
thing." 

He did not think he had sat there a long time, though he 
was not reading, when there was a little stir beside him. He 
looked up. Bess was there. When she got to her own room 
she had sat down by the window to coax back her peace of mind, 
because there was no great pleasure in praying when you had 
probably committed sin. And now here she was at his side, 
looking at him with kind eyes that always had a petition in 
them, the prayer that they might do something for him. 

" I wanted to ask you, sir," she said, " if you think I 've 
done wrong. I want to be — " she hesitated over the word, 
it meant so many strictures and hatefulnesses, and then 
brought it out with a gulp — "a lady." 

There she stood, still holding him with those beseeching 
eyes. Winterbourne looked into them for a long moment. 
They seemed to him like wells of comfort where a man might 
wash himself of offence, if he were conscious of it. But there 
was no need of his bathing there, to come out clean. She 
was, as he had said in that hurried moment, as immediate to 
him as his own hand, but how sweeter than all the roses of 



 





all the Junes, — a rose of heaven for him. He wanted to say 
a great many things to her, now that she had been thrown 
by his forced declaration into such communion with him. 
He wanted to ask her whether she, too, did not wish they 
were innocent, free creatures by some inland sea, uninhabited 
by these phantasms of an artificial world. But waking, he 
said to her gravely, — 

" You are a lady, Bess." 

Her eyes interrogated him. She also had evidently a little 
explanation to make. 

"I wish I could be — what she wants me to." 

This was either tribute to Catherine's ideals or an avowal 
of affection for her. Winterbourne was pretty sure it was not 
the last. 

" Bess," said he, "want to have a secret with me ? " 

Her face went all over a sweet bloom. She answered ra- 
diantly, — 

"Yes, sir." 
' " I 'll tell you. When you do anything I don't think 
they'll like, I'll give you a hint of it."
