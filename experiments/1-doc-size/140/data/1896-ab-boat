longing on the faces of three children 
standing there without, staring hard at 
the winkles, cockles and mussels in the 
window ? 

" Which are the nicest ? " asked we 
with the humility of the non-elect. 

" Mussels, miss ! " rang the concerted 
shout, whereupon tuppence each turned 
the loiterers into mussel-eating monarchs.

Two of US will never set eyes on the 
London barrows loaded with like marine 
delicacies without choking reminiscence 
of a certain expedition planned, gloated 
over in the night-watches and never ac- 
complished. For we had invited a lady 
of social high degree, who knows only 
poetic and fashionable London, and for 
whom the City is a myth, to vouchsafe 
us one day wherein to show her the 
World and the joys thereof. She should 
ride on the tops of 'buses, she should be 
presented to the Duke of SuflFolk's head, 
resident in the Minories, salute Gog and 
Magog, and pause before the tree " at the 
corner of Wood Street.'' But alas! in 
a moment of ill-judged prophecy we re- 
ferred to the mussels of Shoreditch to 
be purchased from a barrow and dipped 
in the public vinegar ; and being daintily 
nurtured, thenceforth she would none of 
our unholy pranks. 

Milk is no uncommon beverage, yet 
sometimes it has a taste of all Arcadia. 
One June day when we were on the 
march brought us to the Welsh paradise 
of Montgomery, where Magdalen Her- 
bert's castle heights are standing, crown- 
less, wonderful. We were entering the 
 

village foot-sore but never weary (and 
with no time for food, for there were 
many miles to tramp, that night, before 
we got home to our den, O) and there, 
providentially meeting us, came a clean 
woman driving a clean cow into a tidy 
yard. Never was bargain more swiftly 
sealed. She disappeared to bring two 
bright glasses and a quart measure. 
She milked and we, throned on a strip 
of turf, drank, while round about us 
thronged the village children, solemnly 
classifying two gaitered, short-skirted 
and apparently hollow monsters. That 
was milk such as they drink on Olympus 
when Hebe serves, though possibly only 
a cut above the draughts permanently on 
tap, for a penny or for love, at farm-house 
doors. 

We are wise, we who go gypsying. 
We have known what it is to find mush- 
rooms on the Stratford Road and to smell 
them, one strange Dorset day, through a 
choking mist through which the trees 
seemed walking toward us as we went. 
How good must elf-men be, we said, to 
set a banquet there for such as are born 
with eyes and nose ! We have learned 
the soul-satisfying quality of raw tujnips, 

 

for we fed thereon, one hungry, happy 
afternoon in Kent. We have lived. 

Certain harmless fictions dominate the 
English mind regarding the national 
"victuals." Smile over them, and enjoy 
the more. You may long for apples, and 
" seek all day ere you find them ; '' for 
the English apple, as it appears in the 
market, is prone to show a degree of 
hardness known to us in no article of 
food save sugar gooseberries. " I like a 
good tasty apple meself," said an English 
wench, setting white teeth into a knurly 
pippin ; " something to bite on ! " She 
had it; a baby foreordained to gums 
might have cut molars upon it. You 
may ask plaintively for vegetables, in 
ordering your dinner, to be answered 
daily, with a narve air of delighted dis- 
covery, "Potatoes!" And should you 
hint at a larger ambition, a nobler quest, 
you may count yourself proud and happy 
if the omnipresent pea is an available 
candidate, albeit the only one. There 
may be set before you a loathsome and 
greasy compound with the encouraging 
dictum, "This is an American dough- 
nut ! '' (An historic introduction : " Pud- 
ding — Alice ; Alice — pudding. Re- 

 

move the pudding!") But though, for 
honor's sake, you deny the fallacy, you 
shall eschew its ocular proof. Every- 
where seek out the native and historic 
dish; and some happy day, if Fortune 
fawn upon you, roasted crabs may hiss 
for you in the bowl, and you shall have 
saffron in the warden pies. 

 

We would hear the nightingale, but, 
more slenderly equipped than John Bur- 
roughs in the same fine quest, we had 
not the certainty of making literary capi- 
tal out of our ill-success. For us failure 
was failure : a handful of the summer's 
gold irretrievably wasted. At Warwick, 
sure of place "and time agreeing," we 
made careful inquiry where the bird of 
wonder might be sought. According to 
the popular voice, the woods were full of 
nightingales ; I remember writing home, 
in a fit of emulous extravagance, that the 
tongues thereof daily served the castle 
lord and lordlings for breakfast. "Go 
down on the bridge, miss, at nine o'clock," 
said the optimistic landlady. " They do 
sing there most beautiful. 'Know one
