slain, while the Revenge lost but forty, 
when his boat was riddled through and 
through, and he himself was wounded, 
he would fain have blown up the vessel, 
and was forced to surrender only through 
want of ammunition. Three days after, 
he died of his wounds, saying in Span- 
ish, that his captors might understand 
and know themselves defied to the last, 
" Here die I, Richard Grenvile, with a 
joyful and quiet mind, for that I have 
ended my life as a good soldier ought to 
do, who has fought for his country and 
his queen, for honor and religion." 

Such was Richard Grenvile, who walks 
through " Westward Ho ! " and the pages 
of less poetic history " a wise and gallant 
gentleman, lovely to all good men, awful 
to all bad men : in whose presence none 
dare say or do a mean or a ribald thing ; 
whom brave men left, feeling themselves 
nerved to do their duty better, while 
cowards slipped away, as bats arid owls 
before the sun." Well is he remembpred 
as " the great Sir Richard, the pride of 
North Devon." 

Kingsley's authority has been ques- 
tioned for making Bideford one of Eng- 
land's chief ports in the sixteenth cen- 
 

tury, though its halcyon days, beginning 
under Elizabeth, rapidly brightened, 
until its commerce with America and 
Newfoundland became exceeding great. 
French and Spanish privateers found 
Bideford ships such rich booty that they 
seized them in the very offing of the 
Taw and Torridge, and ironically named 
the spot " Golden Bay." But such flour- 
ishing of commerce is a thing of the past, 
for now the shipping trade of the Tor- 
ridge is conducted mainly at the neigh- 
boring town of Appledore. Burrough 
in Northam, where Kingsley fixed the 
home of Amyas Leigh, has been for 
centuries the seat of a family of the 
name of Leigh, two of whom were sea- 
faring men, and one, in Elizabeth's time, 
" Chief Pilot of England/' A member 
of a luckless expedition to the Arctic 
seas in the sixteenth century, he daringly 
continued his voyage, even though a 
companion ship was separated from him 
by wind and weather. On he sailed 
into the north, the region of perpetual 
mystery, and, most undaunted of pio- 
neers, entered the White Sea, naming 
the North Cape by the way. Again, in 
an insignificant vessel with a tiny crew, 
 

he sailed triumphantly to a point within 
the Kara Sea, "beyond which," says 
Prince, "no navigator went until our 
own day." Truly Amyas the giant came 
of a goodly race, and one whose tradi- 
tions bound him to heroic deeds. 

Near the mouth of the Torridge lies a 
delightfully clean little town, a seaside 
resort of some pretension. This is West- 
ward Ho, born of the great book to 
which the region is yearly indebted for 
crowding visitors. Though the town is 
modern, even amazingly so among such 
surroundings, its near neighbor is as old 
as â€” what i Let geology tell us. I had 
sdmost said, in the ignorant enthusiasm 
of the unscientific pilgrim, "as old as 
Adam." This neighbor is the Pebble 
Ridge, whose moaning told poor Mrs. 
Leigh, three miles away in Bideford 
town, that the sea and winds were rap- 
idly rising, and that her boy, on his way 
to Ireland, would not sleep that night. 
The Ridge is simply a wide beach heaped 
with pebbles, the smallest larger than 
the fist, and on the day of my pilgrimage 
lying at rest beside a calm sea and under 
a smiling sky. But it is easily to be 
guessed that when the demons of air and 
 

water strive together, these missiles of 
the deep, wet with ocean spume, are cast 
mightily upon one another, until they 
rattle like the fetters of giants captive. 
Behind them lie Northam Burrows, broad, 
smiling expanses clothed with coarse 
grass, and delightful to the British golfer, 
who there amuses himself religiously, 
quite as the Armada captains played at 
skittles on the Hoe. Is it beyond pos- 
sibility that, in our own " empty day," 
some game of golf may be historic ? 

When and where shall the pilgrim 
content himself.? Shall he follow the 
uttermost traces of those he would fain 
have known, and, knowing, offered rev- 
erence, even when the present fails to 
copy fair the past i If he elect to do so, 
then may he seek Freshwater at Clovelly, 
where " Irish ffoxe came out of rocks," 
to lose his brush of self-sufficiency, de- 
spoiled by giant Amyas ; yet here he will 
find but slender trickling of the stream 
of clear water, and slight reminder of 
such shy quarry, so peaceful is the scene. 
He may religiously visit Marsland Mouth, 
where lived Lucy Passmore, the "white 
witch," to find it a Devonshire combe, 
full of every-day contentment ; or he may 
 

traverse Dartmoor, and put the finger of 
fancy on the very spot where Ssilvation 
Yeo slew the king of the Gubbings. 
Time and enthusiasm must direct him, 
but he can scarcely be disappointed in 
any Devonian quest, even where he looks 
for castle or hovel, and finds not one 
stone left upon another ; for always and 
everywhere are the changeful skies, 
warm cliffs, and smiling or tempestuous 
sea ; everywhere his hope will be set in 
the gold of trefoil or the rose of heather.
