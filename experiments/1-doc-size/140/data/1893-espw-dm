 

dark ; only one light burned in it ; that was 
in the study, and the study was an ell. The 
President sat in the room, hard at work. 
The ell had an outer door of its own, 
expressly for the use of the students, and Don 
ald, without a moment 's hesitation, loudly 
rang the bell of the study door. 

The President opened it directly, with 
some nervousness ; and, seeing who it was, 
he said, with the irritation of a man who 
feels that he has been needlessly alarmed : 

" Marcy ? Why, come in ! What can 
you want at this hour ? " 

Donald stepped into the bright, warm 
room, and stood among the books, which 
reached from floor to ceiling all about the 
study. At that moment nothing seemed so 
vivid to him as the educated life which this 
spot represented ; the honor and the 
preciousness of all those intangible values which 
come to a man from the self-denial of 
thought, and toil, and gravity of purpose, 
and simplicity of life. His own vague 
young dreams of the some time when he, too, 
would belong to that high world which 
scholars know, swam before his brain 
dizzily. He had to collect himself, he tried 
to control himself, not to think of what 





he was about to surrender forever ; he found 
it difficult to articulate. He looked at the 
President appealingly. 

"Speak out, man ! " cried President Bax 
ter, a little crossly. " What is your 
errand ? " 

A woman 's figure seemed, to Donald 's 
excited vision, to float between his faltering 
purpose and the stern face of the college 
officer. Odd ! But the thing which stead 
ied the boy, and gave him the grace and 
strength of his emergency at that moment, 
the only thing that calmed his tumultuous 
thoughts into words, and his words into the 
prompt and manly ring that the President 
spoke of afterward, was the image of 
Trouncey 's mother. A pity to " disappoint 
" a woman, and a dead one, too ! 

" Sir," said Donald simply, " I've come 
to own up. Don't expel O Grian. He 
wasn't in that graveyard scrape. I was." 

When Donald got back to his room, he 
had lemons and sugar, and proceeded 
quietly to make his lemonade. Trouncey was 
asleep on the lounge, looking as miserable 
as a boy, when misery could not keep him 
awake, might be expected to look. 



 

Donald waited till the lemonade was hot, 
and then brought some (in his toilet mug), 
and waked the sleeper with a little push. 

" Come, Trouncey," he said gently, 
" here 's your lemonade. It 's piping hot. 
And you're not expelled, Trouncey. I've 
seen the President. It 's all right." 

Trouncey O Grian sat up sleepily and 
stared at Donald 's excited face. 

" The dickens you have ! Say ! Marcy ? 
well. Yes. Seen the President ! Good 
heavens ! But what in time did he say to 
you ? " 

" Oh, he didn't say very much," said 
Don quietly. "He told me the faculty 
would consider my case and let me know in 
a few days." 



CHAPTER VIII. 
THE FACULTY S VIEW OF IT. 

HARLE COLLEGE grew no calmer when 
the latest developments in the hazing scrape 
became widely known. Calhoun was be 
ginning to improve ; the fever had abated, 
and signs of intelligence in the sick boy 
returned. His doctor ventured to give a 
favorable prognosis for the outcome of the 
illness ; and the easy hope of the sanguine 
students bobbed to the surface gayly. 
College sympathy, now that the Freshman 's 
danger had decreased, lurched over to the 
popular Sophomore. 

Ben Braggs was expelled in good ear 
nest; and there was no more than the usual 
amount of college growling at this 
exhibition of discipline. But Braggs was not pop 
ular. He was a rough, fast, surly fellow, 
who had disgraced the university in other 
ways than heavy hazing, before this ; and 
he retired from the catalogue of the 
institution without any warmer regret than that 



 

vague amount of class feeling which the 
boys thought it proper to expend upon their 
departed comrade. 

With Donald it was another matter. 
Everybody liked Don Marcy too much to 
accept his disgrace. It was fought like a 
general injustice. Then he had done such 
a manly, honorable deed in sacrificing him
