he knew it. Poor Thomas," added Mr. 
Francis Marcy, bringing his short, sharp 
sentence round to a decorous sigh, " was 
always a schemer and a dreamer. He dared 
too much. It was his way. He lacked bal 
last in business matters. But de mortuis 
poor Thomas has gone. You and your 
mother are left. You have not got at this 
moment, sir, three hundred dollars to your 
name." 

" But, my mother ? " gasped Don. " The 
house ? The the maid ? The doctor ? 
Where can my mother live ? " 



 

" The house is mortgaged over its eaves," 
replied Uncle Francis. " The Newport es 
tate may be deeded to her, but I doubt it. 
I haven't found any such papers yet. Your 
father left certain papers to my charge. I 
should have been administrator, if there had 
been anything to administrate upon. There 
isn't." 

" I must leave college, Uncle Francis," 
faltered Donald. "I must leave college," 
he repeated decisively. "I must go right 
to work. I must support my mother and 
myself." 

" I don't see any other way," returned 
Mr. Francis Marcy. " I'm sorry, Donald," 
he added politely. 

" What in the world can I do ? " gasped 
Donald. " I never earned any money in 
my life. I thought when I had graduated 
I should enter the bar. I meant to be a 
distinguished lawyer, Uncle Francis." 

" Well," said his uncle slowly, knocking 
the ashes from his half-burnt cigar lightly 
into an antique Egyptian cup that served 
for an ash-receiver, upon the carved oak 
mantel ; " there are different views about 
that. I 'll tell you what mine are, if you 
care to hear them." 



CHAPTER XXII. 

"I WILL WAIT." 

IT was a July day in Vermont. The sun 
had been far too hot for comfort all the 
morning, and until well past noon ; and 
when the long shadows from Mount Tipton 
stole, with purple feet, across the valley, the 
village drew breath, and began to put on 
its afternoon dress, and was glad of it. The 
farmhouses prisons when winter-bound 
were palaces of life in the heart of sum 
mer. To them was given such pomp of the 
shadow-chased hills, and such glory of the 
clover-crimsoned fields, and such splendor 
of the throbbing skies, as the stifling towns 
panted for, and paid the best of prices to 
procure. Each of these desolate homes was 
now a thriving house of entertainment, where 
the daughters of the house stood no more 
breathing the frost off the windows to see a 
stranger pass, but blossomed in the crispest 
of colored cotton-satine gowns, with fresh 
crimps, and white aprons, to wait on the 



 

supper-table of a busy, chattering, laughing 
house. The most popular boarding-house 
in town was Mrs. Joe Jouncey 's of toboggan 
memory, and Lamentations took the lady 
boarders out every day up and down the fern- 
clad banks of the mountain-trout brooks, at 
fifty cents an hour. 

Mr. Jasper, the proprietor of The Hack, 
was much exercised in his mind that after 
noon. The minister had a guest that morning, 
arrived by the night express, who had 
declined to patronize The Hack. 

" He said he couldn't afford it," com 
plained Mr. Jasper to the postmistress. " A 
likely story ! Him not affordin anything. 
He walked all the way up, on his two legs ; 
just as if he'd grow'd here." 

" In this blazing sun ! " reproved the 
postmistress. " That boy, who never had a 
stroke of hardship in his life ! And poplar 
as he was in Tipton ! I sh'd like to know 
why you let him, Jarsper, / should ! " 

" Why, I never thought on't ! " gasped 
the proprietor of The Hack. " It never 
came into my head to offer him The Hack. 
I don't believe he'd have put foot in Her, 
more n if I'd horsewhipped him. He had 
that look. I wouldn't ha darst." 





It was now well on in the afternoon, and 
Donald and Fay were, for the first time, 
alone together. They had chatted with the 
family, of surface things, all day. Don had 
not said much about his circumstances or 
his plans. Nobody had felt like asking for 
what he did not offer. He had petted the 
cannibal cat ; and shaken hands with the 
little maid, and inquired after her elbows ; and 
had gone out to feed Old William ; and he 
had wandered about, and thought how de 
lightful the parsonage was without wood- 
boxes ; and he had gone upstairs to his old 
room, and gloried at the absence of the air 
tight stove, and felt dazed at the 
transformation from the frozen water-pitcher to the 
English violets on the toilet - table ; from 
the frosted to the open window, from all the 
austerities and sterilities of the Vermont
