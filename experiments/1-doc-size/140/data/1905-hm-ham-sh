dressed, donned my Capuchin's robe and took a look at myself in the
pier-glass.  Then I unwrapped the package and put on the mask.  The
whole made a capital outfit, and I was vastly pleased with myself.
This was going to be such an adventure as one reads about in the
ancient numbers of Blackwood's.  I slipped the robe and mask into my
suit-case and lighted my pipe.  During great moments like this, a man
gathers courage and confidence from a pipeful of tobacco.  I dropped
into a comfortable Morris, touched the gas-logs, and fell into a
pleasant dream.  It was not necessary for me to start for the
Twenty-third Street ferry till nine; so I had something like
three-quarters of an hour to idle away. . . .  What beautiful hair that
girl had!  It was like sunshine, the silk of corn, the yield of the
harvest.  And the marvelous abundance of it!  It was true that she was
an artist's model; it was equally true that she had committed a mild
impropriety in addressing me as she had; but, for all I could see, she
was a girl of delicate breeding, doubtless one of the many whose family
fortunes, or misfortunes, force them to earn a living.  And it is no
disgrace these days to pose as an artist's model.  The classic oils,
nowadays, call only for exquisite creations in gowns and hats;
mythology was exhausted by the old masters.  Rome, Paris, London;
possibly a bohemian existence in these cities accounted for her ease in
striking up a conversation, harmless enough, with a total stranger.  In
Paris and Rome it was all very well; but it is a risky thing to do in
unromantic New York and London.  However, her uncle had been with her;
a veritable fortress, had I over-stepped the bounds of politeness.

The smoke wavered and rolled about me.  I took out the ten of hearts
and studied it musingly.  After all, should I go?  Would it be wise?  I
confess I saw goblins' heads peering from the spots, and old Poe
stories returned to me!  Pshaw!  It was only a frolic, no serious harm
could possibly come of it.  I would certainly go, now I had gone thus
far.  What fool idea the girl was bent on I hadn't the least idea; but
I easily recognized the folly upon which I was about to set sail.
Heigh-ho!  What was a lonely young bachelor to do?  At the most, they
could only ask me to vacate the premises, should I be so unfortunate as
to be discovered.  In that event, Teddy Hamilton would come to my
assistance. . . .  She was really beautiful!  And then I awoke to the
alarming fact that the girl in Mouquin's was interesting me more than I
liked to confess.

Presently, through the haze of smoke, I saw a patch of white paper on
the rug in front of the pier-glass.  I rose and picked it up.


  NAME:  Hawthorne
  COSTUME:  Blue Domino
  TIME:  5:30 P. M.
  RETURNED:
  ADDRESS:  West 87th Street

         FRIARD'S


I stared at the bit of pasteboard, fascinated.  How the deuce had this
got into my apartments?  A Blue Domino?  Ha!  I had it!  Old Friard had
accidentally done up the ticket with my mask.  A Blue Domino; evidently
I wasn't the only person who was going to a masquerade.  Without doubt
this fair demoiselle was about to join the festivities of some
shop-girls' masquerade, where money and pedigree are inconsequent
things, and where everybody is either a "loidy" or a "gent."  Persons
who went to my kind of masquerade did not rent their costumes; they
laid out extravagant sums to the fashionable modiste and tailor, and
had them made to order.  A Blue Domino: humph!

It was too late to take the ticket back to Friard's; so I determined to
mail it to him in the morning.

It was now high time for me to be off.  I got into my coat and took
down my opera hat.  Outside the storm was still active; but the snow
had a promising softness, and there were patches of stars to be seen
here and there in the sky.  By midnight there would be a full moon.  I
got to Jersey City without mishap; and when I took my seat in the
smoker, I found I had ten minutes to spare.  I bought a newspaper and
settled down to read the day's news.  It was fully half an hour between
Jersey City and Blankshire; in that time I could begin and finish the
paper.

There never was a newspaper those days that hadn't a war-map in some
one of its columns; and when I had digested the latest phases of the
war in the far East, I quite naturally turned to the sporting-page to
learn what was going on among the other professional fighters.  (Have I
mentioned to you the fact that I was all through the Spanish War, the
mix-up in China, and that I had resigned my commission to accept the
post of traveling salesman for a famous motor-car company?  If I have
not, pardon me.  You will now readily accept my recklessness of spirit
as a matter of course.)  I turned over another page; from this I
learned that the fair sex was going back to puff-sleeves again.  Many
an old sleeve was going to be turned upside down.

Fudge!  The train was rattling through the yards.  Another page
crackled.  Ha!  Here was that unknown gentleman-thief again, up to his
old tricks.  It is remarkable how difficult it is to catch a thief who
has good looks and shrewd brains.  I had already written him down as a
quasi-swell.  For months the police had been finding clues, but they
had never laid eyes on the rascal.  The famous Haggerty of the New York
detective force,--a man whom not a dozen New York policemen knew by
sight and no criminals save those behind bars, earthly and
eternal,--was now giving his whole attention to the affair.  Some
gaily-dressed lady at a ball would suddenly find she had lost some
valuable gems; and that would be the end of the affair, for none ever
recovered her gems.

The gentleman-thief was still at large, and had gathered to his account
a comfortable fortune; that is, if he were not already rich and simply
a kleptomaniac.  No doubt he owned one of my racing-cars, and was clear
of the delinquent lists at his clubs.  I dismissed all thought of him,
threw aside the paper, and mentally figured out my commissions on sales
during the past month.  It was a handsome figure, large enough for two.
This pastime, too, soon failed to interest me.  I gazed out of the
window and watched the dark shapes as they sped past.

I saw the girl's face from time to time.  What a fool I had been not to
ask her name!  She could easily have refused, and yet as easily have
granted the request.  At any rate, I had permitted the chance to slip
out of my reach, which was exceedingly careless on my part.  Perhaps
they--she and her uncle--frequently dined at Mouquin's; I determined to
haunt the place and learn.  It would be easy enough to address her the
next time we met.  Besides, she would be curious to know all about the
ten of hearts and the desperate adventure upon which I told her I was
about to embark.  Many a fine friendship has grown out of smaller
things.

Next, turning from the window, I fell to examining my fellow
passengers, in the hope of seeing some one I knew.  Conversation on
trains makes short journeys. . . .  I sat up stiffly in my seat.
Diagonally across the aisle sat the very chap I had met in the
curio-shop!  He was quietly reading a popular magazine, and
occasionally a smile lightened his sardonic mouth.  Funny that I should
run across him twice in the same evening!  Men who are contemplating
suicide never smile in that fashion.  He was smoking a small,
well-colored meerschaum pipe with evident relish.  Somehow, when a man
clenches his teeth upon the mouth-piece of a respectable pipe, it seems
impossible to associate that man with crime.  But the fact that I had
seen him selecting a pistol in a pawnshop rather neutralized the good
opinion I was willing to form.  I have already expressed my views upon
the subject.  The sight of him rather worried me, though I could not
reason why.  Whither was he bound?  Had he finally taken one of
Friard's pistols?  For a moment I was on the point of speaking to him,
if only to hear him tell more lies about the ten of hearts, but I
wisely put aside the temptation.  Besides, it might be possible that he
