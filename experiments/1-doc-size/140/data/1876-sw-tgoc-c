watching Wych Hazel.

'What made you do things in this way, to disappoint all the world?' 
The lady's face wore a smile which was meant to be gracious, 
however the words sounded not so.

'Prue,' said Prim, 'people have a right to be married in their own 
way.'

'But my dear!Don't you think you owe something to society, 
Dane? In your position?'

'I never understood my obligations to society,' said Dane 
carelessly.

'But do you think it is fair, to disappoint all the world?'

'Always fair to disappoint improper curiosity.'

'Well, but why is that improper curiosity?'

'Curiosity about other people's business,' said Dane good-
humouredly.

'And do you call that improper?'

'I suppose not,when custom has made it seem to be your own 
business.'

'That's it; custom has made it not only seem but be so. And I think 
it is perfectly natural and reasonable and proper. When does a lady 
show to more advantage than on her wedding-day? And why 
should not the world have the benefit of it?'

'I do not know why not,' said Dane smiling,'if it suits the parties 
concerned.'

'Why didn't it suit you, you jealous Musulman?'

'When a lady has never been seen to advantage,' remarked Dr. 
Arthur,'that may alter the case. Her Grace is hardly one of 
those.'

Not one word had come from Hazel's lips, that anybody heard, 
since those few which nobody was likely to forget. Indeed she had 
kept herself rather off from the group, among her own dependants, 
one and all of whom had by degrees filled up the background. And 
it was no trifle to give even a touch of the hand to all those eager 
retainers; the touch and the look, which was all she ventured. Now 
the room was clearing again; and whether Hazel had heard all the 
talk or no, her cheeks gave swift token that Dr. Arthur's last 
sentence had reached her ears. "Her Grace"she could not throw 
off the title any more.

But whatever the rights of the public may be in the matter of 
seeing, the right of discussing, with the parties at hand, Hazel 
plainly thought needed a check. So the next thing that attracted
or distractedMrs. Coles, was the soft ringing peal of her little 
whistle; and answering promptly to that, the tea bugle. Then the 
door flew open, and Dingee brought in the tea-service. The tray, 
with the rarest old china cups, which even Rollo had never seen, 
followed by Mrs. Bywank's cakes and other home-like dainties. 
And Wych Hazel glided off to the rather distant table, gathering in 
Mrs. Bywank and Reo and Gyda for her train; and hid herself 
behind the hot water kettle, putting its soft cloud of steam between 
her and all disturbance for the time being. Then Reo was sent to 
build up the fires,he was a rare hand at that; and Dingee was 
despatched for something else; and Hazel demanded little bits of 
help from the other two near her; talking softly to them, it was 
plain, though still with the same grave young face. But the whole 
picture was sweeter than anybody could tell.

Looking at it, from his place in the other group, something drew 
Rollo's steps that way; slow, quiet steps, which however brought 
him to Gyda's side, whom Hazel had seated at the table. While he 
was safe with her, Wych Hazel watched her chance, and the next 
thing Dr. Maryland knew, she had brought and set down by him on 
the table the perfection of a cup of tea. Without a word she was 
away again and back in her place behind the tea urn; where with 
Gyda et her side and the delight of Gyda's eyes standing there near 
the table, Hazel took up the sugar tongs again and tried to 
remember what amount of sweetening commonly sufficed for Mrs. 
Coles.

'Now Dane,' said that lady, with a kind of acid sweetness of 
manner, as Rollo brought her the cup,'do tell me why you have 
conducted things in that way?'

Rollo looked grave and asked what things.

'Why you know! Have you sent out any cards?'

'Have you sent out any cards, Hazel?'

'Things must be sent in before they can be sent out,' said the young 
lady, who having dismissed Dingee had come herself for Dr. 
Maryland's cup.

'Ambiguous'said Dane turning to Mrs. Coles; 'but I take the 
sense of it to be, that no cards were sent. That is not 
unprecedented.'

'For people situated just as you are, my dear, it is. Now tell me
don't you want all these peopleI mean, everybody in generalto 
visit you?'

'Ambiguous again,' said Dane smiling at last a little. 'Suppose, for 
the sake of argument, that we do!'

'Then why not pay them the customary compliment of telling them 
so?'

'But suppose, on the other hand, that we do not?'

'Why you certainly know,' replied Mrs. Coles with some asperity, 
'whether you want them. Do you? or don't you?'

'I think I might say,' answered Dane demurely, 'we do,and we do 
not.'

'But that is nonsense, Dane.'

'Is it?'

'You ought to want them.'

'WellI have told you; we do.'

'Then are you going, when a suitable time comes, are you going to 
invite all these neglected people and give them a good Reception? 
you and Hazel?'

'We will give them a good reception if they come,' said Dane with 
provoking want of enthusiasm.

'O I never can get anything out of you!' said the lady discomfited. 
'I might have known it. Papa, do you think it is well to set all the 
institutions of society at defiance?'

'Why Prue,' said Dr. Maryland somewhat astonished, 'you speak as
