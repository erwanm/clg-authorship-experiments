In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, un- 
der the guidance of the ablest 
mining - engineering talent 
procurable in America. There 
are elaborate works for re- 
ducing the blue rock and 
passing it through one pro- 
cess after another until every 
diamond it contains has been 
hunted down and secured. I 
watched the " concentrators " 
at work — big tanks contain- 
ing mud and water and in- 
visible diamonds — and was 
t old that each could stir and 
churn and properly treat 300 
car-loads of mud per day — 
1,600 pounds to the car-load 
— and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush. I saw the 3 car- 
loads of slush taken to the " pulsators " and there reduced to a 



quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand. Then I fol- 
lowed it to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly- 
spread it out and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they 
showed up. I assisted, and once I found a diamond half as large 
as an almond. It is an exciting kind of fishing, and you feel a 
fine thrill of pleasure every time you detect the glow of one of 
those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark sand. I would 
like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport 
every now and then. Of course there are disappointments. 
Sometimes you find a diamond whidi is not a diamond; it is 
only a quartz crystal or some such worthless thing. The ex- 
pert can generally distinguish it from the precious stone which 
it is counterfeiting ; but if he is in doubt he lays it on a flatiron 
and hits it with a sledge-hammer. If it is a diamond it holds 
its own ; if it is anything else, it is rMuced to powder. I liked 
that experiment very much, and did not tire of repetitions of 
it. It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by any 
personal sense of risk. The De Beers concern treats 8,000 car- 
loads — about 6,000 tons — of blue rock per day, and the result 
is three pounds of diamonds. Value, uncut, $50,000 to $Y0,000. 
After cutting, they will weigh considerably less than a pound, 
but will be worth four or five times as much as they were before. 
All the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, 
with blue rock, placed there by the Company, and looks like 
a plowed field. Exposure for a length of time make the rock 
easier to work than it is when it comes out of the mine. If 
mining should cease now, the supply of rock spread over those 
fields. would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads per day to the 
separating works during three years. The fields are fenced 
and watched ; and at night they are under the constant inspec- 
tion of lofty electric searchlight. They contain fifty or sixty 
million dollars' worth of diamonds, and there is an abundance 
of enterprising thieves around. 



In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden 
wealth. Some time ago the people were granted the privilege 
of a free wash-up. There was a general rush, the work was 
done with thoroughness, and a good harvest of diamonds was 
gathered. 

The deep mining is done by natives. There are many hun- 
dreds of them. They live in quarters built around the inside 
of a great compound. They are a jolly and good-natured lot, 
and accommodating. They performed a war-dance for us, 
which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen. They are 
not allowed outside of the compound during their term of ser- 
vice — three months, I think it is, as a rule. They go down 
the shaft, stand their watch, come up again, are searched, and 
go to bed or to their amusements in the compound ; and this 
routine they repeat, day in and day out. 

It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds — 
successfully. They used to swallow them, and find other ways 
of concealing them, but the white man found ways of beating 
their various games. One man cut his leg and shoved a dia- 
mond into the wound, but even that project did not succeed. 
When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely to 
report it than to steal it, for in the former case they get a re- 
ward, and in the latter they are quite apt to merely get into 
trouble. Some years ago, in a mine not owned by the De 
Beers, a black found what has been claimed to be the largest 
diamond known to the world's history ; and as a reward he 
was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, and 
five hundred dollars. 
It made him a Yan- 
derbilt. He could 
buy four wives, and 
have money left. 
Four wives are an 
ample support for a 
native. with four 
wives he is wholly 
independent, and 
need never do a 
stroke of work again. 
That great dia- 
mond weighs 971 
carats. Some say it 
is as big as a piece of 
alum, others say it 
is as large as a bite 
of rock candy, but 
the best authorities 
agree that it is almost 
exactly the size of a chunk of ice. But those details are not 
important ; and in my opinion not trustworthy. It has a flaw 
in it, otherwise it would be of incredible value. As it is, it is 
held to be worth $2,000,000. After cutting it ought to be 
worth from |5,000,000 to $8,000,000, therefore persons desiring 
to save money should buy it now. It is owned by a syndicate, 
and apparently there is no satisfactory market for it. It is 
earning nothing ; it is eating its head off. Up to this time it 
has made nobody rich but the native who found it. 

He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract. 
That is to say, a company had bought the privilege of taking 
from the mine 5,000,000 carloads of blue-rock, for a sum down 
and a royalty. Their speculation had not paid ; but on the 
very day that their privilege ran out that native found the 
$2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them. Even the 
diamond culture is not without its romantic episodes. 

The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it 
cannot compete in these matters with three which — according 
to legend — are among the crown trinkets of Portugal and 
Russia. One of these is held to be worth $20,000,000 ; another, 
$25,000,000, and the third something over $28,000,000. 

Those are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or 
not ; and yet they are of but little importance by comparison 
with the one wherewith the Boer wagoner chocked his wheel 
on that steep grade as heretofore referred to. In Kimberley I 
had somi conversation with the man who saw the Boer do 
that — an incident which had occurred twenty-seven or twenty-
