of that wayward child, it is you. I only wish that 
I had half your patience and forbearance." 

Time passed steadily on. Another and another 
babe saw the light, until five bright-eyed children 
filled their home with music and sunshine. When 
her care was lavished upon a single child, the mo- 
ther had both mind and heart full. Now her duties 
were increased five fold, but she did not feel them 
to be greater than at first. It seemed to her, when 
she had but one babe, that there was not room in 
her heart for another — but now she found that 
there was room for all. — Each had its appropriate 
place. 

Alike in some general features, these five chil- 
dren were, in particulars, as unlike as possible. 
Marien, the eldest, was a sweet-tempered girl, ten 
years of age. Clarence had improved much under 
the careful training of his mother, though he was 
still rude, self-willed, and too little inclined to re- 


gard properly the rights and comforts of his bro- 
ther and sisters. Henry, next younger than Cla- 
rence, was altogether opposite in character. I'imid, 
bashful and retiring, he had little confidence in 
himself, and was too much inclined to lean upon 
others. Fanny, a laughing little fairy thing, ma- 
king the house musical with her happy voice, and 
Lillian, the babe, filled up the number of Mrs. 
Hartley's household treasures. 

Nearly twelve years had passed since their mar- 
riage, and yet neither James Hartley nor his wife 
were very strongly marked by time. He had a 
more thoughtful, and shea more earnest expression 
of countenance. Their external condition had im- 
proved. He had again entered into business, though 
not with the flattering promises that before encour- 
aged him to hope for a speedily attained fortune ; 
but he was in a surer way to competency at least. 

During this time, both the father and mother of 
Mrs. Hartley died, and a maiden aunt, the sister of 
Anna's mother, had become a member of their 
household. The puritanical prejudices, narrow 
views, and constant interference of this woman 
with Anna's management of her children, were a 
source of great trial. Aunt Mary had no patience 
with the wayward Clarence, while she petted 
and indulged Henry to a degree that was really ior 



 

jurious to a child of his particular disposition. 
Ileaionstraiice was of no avail ; for Aunt Mary 
imagined that her age and relationship entitled her 
to all the control in the family she chose to as- 
sume. She could not understand that Anna, '' the 
child," as she usually spoke of her, had rights and 
responsibilities as a parent, with which she ought 
not to interfere. All this was beyond her compre- 
hension. 

Aunt Mary was a strict church-going member. 
A regular Simday religionist. She seemed to re- 
gard every thing outside of a church as profane. 
There was sin in a pink ribbon, and carnal-mind- 
edness in a blue bonnet. All amusements were 
considered by her as offences against God. To 
attend a ball, or dance, was to insure the soul's 
perdition. Aunt Mary was not one of those who, 
while they hold peculiar and strict notions, have 
the good sense to keep quiet about them where 
they know their declaration not to be agreeable. 
She deemed it her duty to preach from the house 
top, so to speak, on all occasions ; and to declare 
to the children that many of the very things taught 
them by their parents were wrong. When Marien 
and Clarence were first sent to dancing school, 
Aunt Mary preached upon the subject, in season 
and out of season, for nearly a month. 



 

"Toil will ruin your children, Anna," she would 
say. "Isn't it a shame to think that a mother will 
have no more regard for her little ones." 

" How will dancing ruin them, Aunt Mary ?" 
Mrs. Hartley would sometimes ask in a quiet tone. 
" I cannot, for my life, see any evil in motions of 
the body made to accord with good music." 

"Dancing is one of Satan's most cunning de- 
vices to lure the soul to ruin." 

"How is it. Aunt Mary? I cannot understand 
in what the evil lies. Is there any thing in music 
opposed to the Ten Commandments ? Do the 
Ten Commandments forbid dancing?" 

" You reason like a little simpleton, as you are," 
returned Aunt Mary, peevishly. " The Bible for- 
bids dancing." 

" I never saw it, and I believe I have read that 
good book very carefully. It does say, that there 
is a time to dance." 

" It is wicked to quote Scripture, with the inten- 
tion of perverting its meaning," replied Aunt Mary, 
warmly. 

" I know that. But I am not so sure that I have 
done so. The Bible certainly says that there is a 
time to dance." 

" Not in the sense that you pretend to under- 
stand it." 



 

" Why not ?" 

''Because it is wicked to dance, and the Bible 
never teaches us to do what is wicked." 

"Oh! oh!" returned Anna, laughing — "You 
are like a great many other good people, Aunt 
Mary. You first call a thing good or evil to suit 
some notion of your own, and then make the Bible 
prove it whether it will or no. A convenient
