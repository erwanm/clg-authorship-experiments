fore I leave the house. I sent Henry for the min 
ister the first breath you drew, out there on the 
shore, before I sent for the brandy, before you 
gasped twice. He is sitting at the gate this min 
ute, with a borrowed horse, too, that he 's in a 
hurry to get back to a man who is mowing. Don't 
waste any more of our time. It 's too precious for 
you. Come ! " 

" But Doctor, how can I be married, done up in 
blankets like a mummy. It 's so ridiculous ! " 
pleaded Jim. " I 'd have liked my best close on." 

" Paisley ! " said the doctor, towering and superb, 
" did I work over you fourteen minutes after 
every man in Sherman would have given you up 
for dead ? Fourteen minutes longer than is laid 
down by Hering, too, if I remember," she added, 
turning to Yorke. 

" Well, Doctor, I 's pose you did." 

" Did I bring back the soul to your senseless, 
sinful body, after it had gone God knows where, 
but where you 'll never go again till you go to 
stay?" 



 

" That 's a fact, Doctor. Yes, marm." 

" I 've got some rights in your life, have I, 
Jim ? " 

" Yes, marm. I don't deny you brought me 
to." 

" Do you suppose you were worth touching, ex 
cept that you had it in your miserable power to 
right a poor wronged girl? Come ! Do you? " 

" No, marm." 

" If you don't marry Molly before I leave this 
house, every lumberman in Sherman may throw 
you into the mill-pond, and some of them will. 
I 'll stand by and see them do it. I won't lift a 
finger for you." 

" You're hard on a fellow," complained Jim. 
" I hain't said I wouldn't . I only said I 'd rather 
wait and get my best close. I vum, when I come 
to, and Good Lord ! did you see her, Doctor ? 
I hain't done right by her, that 's a fact. I told 
her so." 

" Well, well ! " said Doctor Zay, softening. 
She went at once to call the girl, who lay crouched 
like a spaniel outside the door, upon the bare en 
try floor. " Come here, Molly," she said, with 
ineffable gentleness. " Jim wants to be married." 

Molly stood still. The color slowly crept over 
her delicate neck. 



 

" He hain't asked me himself," she said. Jim 
held out his hand to her. 

" The doctor thought I wasn't  fit to ask you, 
Molly. She ain't far out, either." 

The girl advanced slowly, looking at him searchingly. 
Then, with a certain dignity, she gave the 
man one hand, and said, 

" Very well, Doctor." 

The minister came, talking about his borrowed 
horse. He was worried and hurried. 

" Where is your certificate of intention to mar 
ry?" he asked shortly; "we require five days 
notice of intention in our State." 

" The marriage will be legal," replied Dr. Zay, 
promptly. " I 've had occasion to look into that. 
Whatever formalities are necessary, I will attend 
to myself. I will pay your fine, if you are called 
to account for this." 

" It is a large fine," said the minister, slowly. 

" I will be responsible for it," persisted the Doc 
tor. " I must see the thing done now. Something 
might go wrong with the case yet. The man is 
very weak." 

The old minister yielded his point after a little 
feeble protest ; he wanted to get back to his mow 
ing. 

Yorke and the physician witnessed the marriage. 



 

And the young stepmother, out in the front yard, 
gossiped with the lumbermen through it all. 

Doctor Zay took her patient home immediately 
when the painful scene was over. He was greatly 
exhausted. She sent him at once to bed, left mi 
nute orders for his care, and went off on her after 
noon rounds. 

In the evening she came to him again. She sat 
some time. She was anxious, gentle, half depre 
cating. She gave her professional tenderness a 
beautiful freedom. He felt her sympathy like a 
sparkling tonic. She atoned for what she had 
cost him by a divine hour. 

She did not mention the poor girl. But Yorke 
thought of the caryatid lifting marble arms to hold 
the Temple " high above our heads." 



VIII. 

THE patient continued for several days clearly 
worse for the episode of Molly and Jim. The 
physician was penitently assiduous in her attentions.
