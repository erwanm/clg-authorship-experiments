That was a very enjoyable call,” said Mr. 
Mann, when they were settled in the sleigh. I 
do suppose Denby people were astonished at my 
high-handed procedure ! And you took it so 
meekly,” with a merry kind of laugh. 

Oh, I couldn’t have explained, I was so sur- 
prised myself,” and she smiled at the mirth in his 




eyes. “ I think it was best the way you planned it. 
Even Mr. Beers advised me in a kindly way to be 
very careful about forming any new connection 
and leaving those who had shown themselves my 
friends. No one seems to think you could care for 
so many children, and I am not young.” 

You are just what I want. I shall love you 
more as time goes on and I get accustomed to 
your many virtues,” in a tender tone. 

“ Oh, you flatterer ! ” But her eyes had the 
softness of tears. 

They drove up by the old house. 

I must gather up a few things,” she said, 
“ though the furniture is mostly worn out. I 
used to wonder what we would do by and by, and 
how I could place the children satisfactorily.” 

And now you need have no care about that. 
Yes, come over and pick up what you want, and 
we will send Dan after them. The half-worn 
things you might give to the Bachmans. They do 
not look overstocked.” 

Yes,” she answered, for they certainly were 
not worth an auction. “ There is an old cedar 
chest that was great-grandmother’s, that has no 
end of brass trimmings — Rilla used to scour them 
once or twice a year — and one that was grand- 




mother’s. I packed up some articles in them, 
pretty china and some silver we rarely used. There 
will not be much.” 

“ There may be heirlooms that the children will 
treasure later on. Families are beginning to value 
these things.” 

He remembered with a little sigh that there had 
been nothing he had cared to keep when his house 
was dismantled. Even the few ornaments had 
been of the cheapest sort. Every penny had gone 
to the bank account, nothing for pleasure or hap- 
piness. 

Yes, the little old house did look lonely enough. 
She would be glad to have some one in it. And 
now the sun had dropped down, and the short 
winter day was ending. Mr. Mann started up the 
horses, which seemed nothing loath to hurry 
along. 

“ I do hope the children haven’t turned the 
house upside down. It seems as if we had been 
gone a long while,” said Bessy. 

'' Does it? Why, it seems brief to me, though 
we have accomplished considerable. Don’t worry 
about the children. We may go off and stay a 
week. They will come out all right,” giving a 
half-teasing laugh. 

Oh, how comforting it was to have him think 




them no trouble, and to be so eager for their wel- 
fare and happiness! Would it last? It was un- 
grateful to question, to doubt. Was it not a 
good gift from God as well? 


CHAPTER V 


THE clergyman’s VISIT 

The children had been very well entertained. 
At first Linn and Tip had gone out to the barn 
when they were summoned by a delivery-wagon. 
The girls ran to see what had come. 

'' Oh, it’s my things,” exclaimed Amaryllis. 

Why, it’s everything!'' 

“ As if you were just moving in ! Why, you’ve 
kept it a secret ! ” and Marigold’s tone was one of 
complaint. 

“ Well, they promised the suit and the hat on 
Saturday. They couldn’t say when the rest would 
come.” 

Yes, there was the suit in a large box, and the 
hat in a smaller one ; a bedstead, a chiffonier, and 
a willow rocker. 

They may as well go upstairs at once,” Rilla 
announced with an odd feeling of importance. 

Dan and the man obeyed orders. 

''Gee!” cried Linn. “You’ll be as fine as 
Chan. What will you put in this sort of bureau 
thing?” 



It’s a chiffonier.” Amaryllis had said the 
name over to herself after the clerk, to be sure 
to have it right. Dan took off the stiff paper 
wrappings and unboxed the mirror, while Rilla 
was taking out her suit. 

Oh, it’s splendid!” declared Primrose. ‘‘If 
you only had had it on Sunday! And such a 
dandy hat! Why, you’ll have to walk on ahead 
when we go out. We sha’n’t be fine enough.”
