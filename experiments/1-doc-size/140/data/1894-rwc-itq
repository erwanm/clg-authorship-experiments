lace-covered bed, and a dainty tcilet table on 
which stood a pair of tall silver candlesticks; 
and then, as the soft voice spoke again, "Will 
Monsieur be seated?" he turned and confronted 
the girl whom he had helped in the Place de 
la Concorde. She lay in a cloud of fleecy wrappings on a lounge that was covered with a great 
white bearskin. Her blue eyes met Gethryn's, 
and he smiled faintly. She spoke again: 

"Will Monsieur sit a little nearer? It is difficult to speak loudly, I have so little strength." 

Gethryn walked over to the sofa and half unconsciously sank down on the rug which fell on 
the floor by the invalid's side. He spoke as he 
would to a sick child. 

"I am so very glad you are better. I inquired 
of the concierge and she told me." 

A slight color crept into the girl's face. "You 
are so good. Ah! what should I have done 
what can I say?" She stopped; there were 
tears in her eyes. 



 

"Please say nothing please forget it." 

"Forget!" Presently she continued, almost 
in a whisper, "I had so much to say to you, and 
now you are really here, I can think of nothing, 
only that you saved me." 

"Mademoiselle I beg!" 

She lay silent a moment more; then she 
raised herself from the sofa and held out her 
hand. His hand and eyes met hers, 

"I thank you," she said, "I can never for 
get." Then she sank back among the white 
fluff of lace and fur. "I only learned this morning," she went on, after a minute, "who sat be 
side me all that night and bathed my arm, and 
gave me cooling drinks." 

Gethryn colored. "There was no one else to 
take care of you. I sent for my friend, Doctor 
Ducrot, but he was out of town. Then Dr. 
Bouvier promised to come, and didn't. The 
concierge was ill herself I could not leave you 
alone. You know, you were a little out of your 
head with fright and fever. I really couldn't 
leave you to get on by yourself." 

"No," cried the girl, excitedly, "you could 
not leave me, after carrying me out of that terrible crowd; yourself hurt, exhausted, you sat 
by my side all night long." 

Gethryn laid his hand on her. "Helene," he 
said, half jesting, "I did what any one else would 
have done under the circumstances, and for 
gotten." 

She looked at him shyly. "Don't forget," 
she said. 

"I couldn't forget your face," he rashly answered, moved by the emotion she showed. 

She brightened. 

"Did you know me when you first saw me 
in the crowd?" She expected him to say 
"Yes." 

"No," he replied, "I only saw you were a 
woman and in danger of your life." 

The brightness fell from her face. "Then it 
was all the same to you who I was." 

He nodded. "Yes any woman, you know." 

"Old and dirty and ugly?" 

His hand slipped from hers. "And a woman 
yes. 

She shrugged her pretty shoulders. "Then I 
wish it had been some one else." 

"So do I, for your sake," he answered gravely. 



 

She glanced at him, half frightened, then, 
leaning swiftly toward him: 

"Forgive me; I would not change places with 

a queen." 

"Nor I with any man!" he cried gayly, "Am 

I not Paris?" 

"And I?" 

"You are Helene," he said, laughing. "Let 
me see Paris and Helene would not have 

changed " 

She interrupted him impatiently. "Words! 
you do not mean them. Nor do I either," she 
added, hastily. After that neither spoke for 
awhile. Gethryn, half stretched on the big rugidly twisting bits of it into curls, felt very comfortable, without troubling to ask himself what 
would come next. Presently she glanced up. 

"Paris, do you want to smoke?" 

"You don't think I would smoke in this dainty 
nest?" 

"Please do, I like it. We are we will be 
such very good friends. There are matches on 
that table in the silver box." 

He shook his head, laughing. "You are too 
indulgent." 





"I am never indulgent, excepting to myself. 
But I have caprices and I generally die when 
they are not indulged. This is one. Please
