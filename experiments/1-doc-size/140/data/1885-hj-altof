in a desecrated church, in which a variety of ancient 
objects, disinterred in Arlesian soil, have been ar 
ranged without any pomp. The best of these, I be 
lieve, were found in the ruins of the theatre. Some of 
the most curious of them are early Christian sar 
cophagi, exactly on the pagan model, but covered with 





rude yet vigorously wrought images of the apostles, 
and with illustrations of scriptural history. Beauty 
of the highest kind , either of conception or of execu 
tion, is absent from most of the Roman fragments, 
which belong to the taste of a late period and a 
provincial civilization. But a gulf divides them from 
the bristling little imagery of the Christian sarcophagi, 
in which, at the same time, one detects a vague 
emulation of the rich examples by which their authors 
were surrounded. There is a certain element of style 
in all the pagan things; there is not a hint of it in 
the early Christian relics, among which, according to 
M. Joanne, of the Guide, are to be found more fine 
sarcophagi than in any collection but that of St. John 
Lateran. In two or three of the Roman fragments 
there is a noticeable distinction; principally in a 
charming bust of a boy, quite perfect, with those 
salient eyes that one sees in certain antique busts, and 
to which the absence of vision in the marble mask 
gives a look, often very touching, as of a baffled effort 
to see; also in the head of a woman, found- in the 
ruins of the theatre, who, alas! has lost her nose, and 
whose noble, simple contour, barring this deficiency, 
recalls the great manner of the Venus of Milo. There 
are various rich architectural fragments which in 
dicate that that edifice was a very splendid affair. 
This little Museum at Aries, in short, is the most Ro 
man thing I know of, out of Rome. 



  



XXXII. 

I FIND that I declared one evening, in a little 
journal I was keeping at that time, that I was weary 
of writing (I was probably very sleepy), but that it 
was essential I should make some note of my visit to 
Les Baux. I must have gone to sleep as soon as I 
had recorded this necessity, for I search my small diary 
in vain for any account of that enchanting spot. I 
have nothing but my memory to consult, a memory 
which is fairly good in regard to a general impression, 
but is terribly infirm in the matter of details and 
items. We knew in advance, my companion and I, 
that Les Baux was a pearl of picturesqueness; for 
had we not read as much in the handbook of Murray, 
who has the testimony of an English nobleman as to 
its attractions? We also knew that it lay some miles 
from Aries, on the crest of the Alpilles, the craggy 
little mountains which, as I stood on the breezy plat 
form of Beaucaire, formed to my eye a charming, if 
somewhat remote, background to Tarascon; this as 
surance having been given us by the landlady of the 
inn at Aries, of whom we hired a rather lumbering 
conveyance. The weather was not promising, but it 
proved a good day for the mediaeval Pompeii; a gray, 
melancholy, moist, but rainless, or almost rainless 
day, with nothing in the sky to flout, as the poet 
says, the dejected and pulverized past. The drive 





itself was charming; for there is an inexhaustible 
sweetness in the gray-green landscape of Provence. 
It is never absolutely flat, and yet is never really 
ambitious, and is full both of entertainment and re 
pose. It is in constant undulation, and the bareness 
of the soil lends itself easily to outline and profile. 
When I say the bareness, I mean the absence of 
woods and hedges. It blooms with heath and scented 
shrubs and stunted olive; and the white rock shining 
through the scattered herbage has a brightness which 
answers to the brightness of the sky. Of course it 
needs the sunshine, for all southern countries look a 
little false under the ground glass of incipient bad 
weather. This was the case on the day of my pil 
grimage to Les Baux. Nevertheless, I was as glad 
to keep going as I was to arrive; and as I went it 
seemed to me that true happiness would consist in 
wandering through such a land on foot, on September 
afternoons, when one might stretch one 's self on the 
warm ground in some shady hollow, and listen to the 
hum of bees and the whistle of melancholy shepherds; 
for in Provence the shepherds whistle to their flocks. 
I saw two or three of them, in the course of this drive 
to Les Baux, meandering about, looking behind, and 
calling upon the sheep in this way to follow, which 
the sheep always did, very promptly, with ovine 
unanimity. Nothing is more picturesque than to see 
a slow shepherd threading his way down one of the 
winding paths on a hillside, with his flock close be 
hind him, necessarily expanded, yet keeping just at 



  

his heels, bending and twisting as it goes, and looking 
rather like the tail of a dingy comet. 

About four miles from Aries, as you drive north 
ward toward the Alpilles, of which Alphonse Daudet 
has spoken so often, and, as he might say, so in 
timately, stand on a hill that overlooks the road 
the very considerable ruins of the abbey of Mont- 
majour, one of the innumerable remnants of a feudal 
and ecclesiastical (as well as an architectural) past 
that one encounters in the South of France; remnants 
which, it must be confessed, tend to introduce a cer 
tain confusion and satiety into the passive mind of 
the tourist. Montmajour, however, is very impressive 
and interesting; the only trouble with it is that, 
unless you have stopped and returned to Aries, you 
see it in memory over the head of Les Baux, which 
is a much more absorbing picture. A part of the 
mass of buildings (the monastery) dates only from the 
last century; and the stiff architecture of that period 
does not lend itself very gracefully to desolation: it 
looks too much as if it had been burnt down the year 
before. The monastery was demolished during the 
Revolution, and it injures a little the effect of the 
very much more ancient fragments that are connected 
with it. The whole place is on a great scale; it was
