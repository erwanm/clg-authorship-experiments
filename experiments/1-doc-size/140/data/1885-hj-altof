to their affiliation to the great Balzac, who had invented 
an artificial reality which was as much better than the 
vulgar article as mock-turtle soup is than the liquid it 
emulates. The first time I read "Les Illusions Perdues" 
I should have refused to believe that I was capable of 
passing the old capital of Anjou without alighting to 
visit the Houmeau. But we never know what we are 
capable of till we are tested, as I reflected when I 
found myself looking back at Angouleme from the 
window of the train , just after we had emerged from 
the long tunnel that passes under the town. This 
tunnel perforates the hill on which, like Poitiers, 
Angouleme rears itself, and which gives it an eleva 
tion still greater than that of Poitiers. You may have 
a tolerable look at the cathedral without leaving the 
railway-carriage; for it stands just above the tunnel, 
and is exposed, much foreshortened, to the spectator 
below. There is evidently a charming walk round the 
plateau of the town, commanding those pretty views 
of which Balzac gives an account. But the   train 
whirled me away, and these are my only impressions. 
The truth is that I had no need, just at that moment, 
of putting myself into communication with Balzac; for 
opposite to me in the compartment were a couple of 
figures almost as vivid as the actors in the "Comedie 
Humaine." One of these was a very genial and dirty 
old priest, and the other was a reserved and concen 
trated young monk, the latter (by which I mean a 
monk of any kind) being a rare sight to-day in France. 
This young man, indeed, was mitigatedly monastic. 



  

He had a big brown frock and cowl, but he had also 
a shirt and a pair of shoes; he had, instead of a 
hempen scourge round his waist, a stout leather thong, 
and he carried with him a very profane little valise. 
He also read, from beginning to end, the "Figaro" 
which the old priest, who had done the same, presented 
to him; and he looked altogether as if, had he not 
been a monk, he would have made a distinguished 
officer of engineers. When he was not reading the 
"Figaro" he was conning his breviary or answering, 
with rapid precision and with a deferential but dis 
couraging dryness, the frequent questions of his com 
panion, who was of quite another type. This worthy 
had a bored, good-natured, unbuttoned, expansive 
look; was talkative, restless, almost disreputably human. 
He was surrounded by a great deal of small luggage, 
and had scattered over the carriage his books, his 
papers, the fragments of his lunch, and the contents 
of an extraordinary bag, which he kept beside him 
a kind of secular reliquary and which appeared to 
contain the odds and ends of a lifetime, as he took 
from it successively a pair of slippers, an old padlock 
(which evidently didn 't belong to it), an opera-glass, a 
collection of almanacs, and a large sea-shell, which he 
very carefully examined. I think that if he had not 
been afraid of the young monk, who was so much 
more serious than he, he would have held the shell to 
his ear, like a child. Indeed, he was a very childish 
and delightful old priest, and his companion evidently 
thought him most frivolous. But I liked him the better 





of the two. He was not a country cure, but an eccle 
siastic of some rank, who had seen a good deal both 
of the church and of the world; and if I too had not 
been afraid of his colleague, who read the "Figaro" 
as seriously as if it had been an encyclical, I should 
have entered into conversation with him. 

All this while I was getting on to Bordeaux, where 
I permitted myself to spend three days. I am afraid 
I have next to nothing to show for them, and that 
there would be little profit in lingering on this episode, 
which is the less to be justified as I had in former 
years examined Bordeaux attentively enough. It con 
tains a very good hotel, an hotel not good enough, 
however, to keep you there for its own sake. For the 
rest, Bordeaux is a big, rich, handsome, imposing com 
mercial town, with long rows of fine old eighteenth- 
century houses, which overlook the yellow Garonne. I 
have spoken of the quays of Nantes as fine, but those 
of Bordeaux have a wider sweep and a still more 
architectural air. The appearance of such a pDrt as 
this makes the Anglo-Saxon tourist blush for the sor 
did water-fronts of Liverpool and New York, which, 
with their larger activity, have so much more reason 
to be stately. Bordeaux gives a great impression of 
prosperous industries, and suggests delightful ideas, 
images of prune-boxes and bottled claret. As the focus 
of distribution of the best wine in the world, it is in 
deed a sacred city, dedicated to the worship of 
Bacchus in the most discreet form. The country all 
about it is covered with precious vineyards, sources of 



  

fortune to their owners and of satisfaction to distant 
consumers; and as you look over to the hills beyond 
the Garonne you see them in the autumn sunshine, 
fretted with the rusty richness of this or that immortal 
clos. But the principal picture, within the town, is that 
of the vast curving quays, bordered with houses that 
look like the hotels of farmers-general of the last cen 
tury, and of the wide, tawny river, crowded with ship 
ping and spanned by the largest of bridges. Some of 
the types on the water-side are of the sort that arrest 
a sketcher, figures of stalwart, brown-faced Basques, 
such as I had seen of old in great numbers at Biarritz, 
with their loose circular caps, their white sandals, their 
air of walking for a wager. Never was a tougher, a 
harder race. They are not mariners, nor watermen, 
but, putting questions of temper aside, they are the 
best possible dock-porters. "II 's y fait un commerce 
terrible," a douanier said to me, as he looked up and 
down the interminable docks; and such a place has 
indeed much to say of the wealth, the capacity for 
production, of France, the bright, cheerful, smokeless 
industry of the wonderful country which produces, 
above all, the agreeable things of life, and turns even 
its defeats and revolutions into gold. The whole town 
has an air of almost depressing opulence, an appear 
ance which culminates in the great place which sur 
rounds the Grand-Theatre, an establishment in the 
highest style, encircled with columns, arcades, lamps, 
gilded cafes. One feels it to be a monument to the
