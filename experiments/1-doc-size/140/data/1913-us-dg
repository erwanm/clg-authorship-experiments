George stood firmly by this position, and 
so in the end she had to give way. It 
did not seem quite modest in her to con- 
tinue persisting. 



 

George volunteered to write a letter to 
her father; and he hoped this would 
settle the matter without further dis- 
cussion. But in this he was disappointed. 
There had to be a long correspondence 
with long arguments and protestations 
from Henriette's father and from his own 
mother. It seemed such a singular whim. 
Everybody persisted in diagnosing his symp- 
toms, in questioning him about what the 
doctor had said, who the doctor was, how 
he had come to consult him — all of which, 
of course, was very embarrassing to George, 
who could not see why they had to make 
such a fuss. He took to cultivating a 
consumptive look, as well as he could 
imagine it; he took to coughing as he went 
about the house — and it was all he could 
do to keep from laughing, as he saw the 
look of dismay on his poor mother's face. 
After all, however, he told himself that he 
was not deceiving her, for the disease he 
had was quite as serious as tuberculosis. 

It was very painful and very trying. 
But there was nothing that could be done 
about it; the marriage had been put off 



 

for six months, and in the meantime he 
and Henriette had to control their impa- 
tience and make the best of their situation. 
Six months was a long time; but what if it 
had been three or four years, as the other 
doctor had demanded? That would have 
been a veritable sentence of death. 

George, as we have seen, was conscien- 
tious, and regular and careful in his habits. 
He took the medicine which the new 
doctor prescribed for him; and day by 
day he watched, and to his great rehef 
saw the troublesome symptoms gradu- 
ally disappearing. He began to take 
heart, and to look forward to life with his 
former buoyancy. He had had a bad 
scare, but now everything was going to 
be all right. 

Three or four months passed, and the 
doctor told him he was cured. He really 
was cured, so far as he could see. He was 
sorry, now, that he had asked for so long 
a delay from Henriette; but the new date 
for the wedding had been announced, and 
it would be awkward to change it again. 
George told himself that he was being 



 

"extra careful.' and he was repaid for the 
inconvenience by the feehng of virtue 
derived from the delay. He was relieved 
that he did not have to cough any more, 
or to invent any more tales of his interviews 
with the imaginary lung-specialist. Some- 
times he had guilty feelings because of 
all the lying he had had to do; but he told 
himself that it was for Henriette's sake. 
She loved him as much as he loved her. 
She would have suffered needless agonies 
had she known the truth; she would never 
have got over it — so it would have been a 
crime to tell her. 

He really loved her devotedly, thoroughly. 
From the beginning he had thought 
as much of her mental sufferings as he 
had of any physical harm that the dread 
disease might do to him. How could he 
possibly persuade himseK to give her up, 
when he knew that the separation would 
break her heart and ruin her whole life? 
No; obviously, in such a dilemma, it 
was his duty to use his own best judg- 
ment, and get himself cured as quickly 
as possible. After that he would be true 



 

to her, he would take no more chances of a 
loathsome disease. 

The secret he was hiding made him feel 
humble — made him unusually gentle in 
his attitude towards the girl. He was a 
perfect lover, and she was ravished with 
happiness. She thought that all his suf- 
ferings were because of his love for her, 
and the delay which he had imposed out 
of his excess of conscientiousness. So 
she loved him more and more, and never 
was there a happier bride than Henriette 
Loches, when at last the great day arrived. 

They went to the Riviera for their 
honeymoon, and then returned to live in 
the home which had belonged to George's 
father. The investment in the notary's 
practice had proven a good one, and so 
life held out every promise for the young 
couple. They were divinely happy. 

After a while, the bride communicated 
to her husband the tidings that she was 
expecting a child. Then it seemed to 
George that the cup of his earthly bliss was 
full. His ailment had slipped far into the 
background of his thoughts, like an evil
