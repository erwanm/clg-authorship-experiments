Greensboro’ Patriot (N. C.), Nov. 6:

                           10 DOLLARS REWARD.

  RANAWAY from my service, in February, 1851, a colored man named
  EDWARD WINSLOW, low, thick-set, part Indian, and a first rate
  fiddler. Said Winslow was sold out of Guilford jail, at February
  court, 1851, for his prison charges, for the term of five years. It
  is supposed that he is at work on the Railroad, somewhere in
  Davidson county. The above reward will be paid for his apprehension
  and confinement in the jail of Guilford or any of the adjoining
  counties, so that I get him, or for his delivery to me in the
  south-east corner of Guilford. My post-office is Long’s Mills,
  Randolph, N. C.

                      TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD.

  THE above reward will be given for the apprehension and confinement
  in any jail of the negro man HARDY, who ran away from the
  subscriber, residing on Lake St. John, near Rifle Point, Concordia
  parish, La., on the 9th August last. Hardy is a remarkably likely
  negro, entirely free from all marks, scars or blemishes, when he
  left home; about six feet high, of black complexion (though quite
  light), fine countenance, unusually smooth skin, good head of
  hair, fine eyes and teeth.

  Address the subscriber at Rifle Point, Concordia Parish, La.

What an unfortunate master—lost an article entirely free from “marks,
scars or blemishes”! Such a rarity ought to be choice!

Savannah Daily Georgian, 6th Sept., 1852:

                               ARRESTED.

  ABOUT three weeks ago, under suspicious circumstances, a negro
  woman, who calls herself PHEBE, or PHILLIS. Says she is free, and
  lately from Beaufort District, South Carolina. Said woman is about
  50 years of age, stout in stature, mild-spoken, 5 feet 4 inches
  high, and weighs about 140 pounds. Having made diligent inquiry by
  letter, and from what I can learn, said woman is a runaway. Any
  person owning said slave can get her by making application to me,
  properly authenticated.

                                                   WARING RUSSELL,
                                                     County Constable.

                          250 DOLLARS REWARD.

  RANAWAY from Sparta, Ga., about the first of last year my boy
  GEORGE. He is a good carpenter, about 35 years; a bright mulatto,
  tall and quite likely. He was brought about three years ago from
  St. Mary’s, and had, when he ran away, a wife there, or near there,
  belonging to a Mr. Holzendorff. I think he has told me he has been
  about Macon also. He had, and perhaps still has, a brother in
  Savannah. He is very intelligent. I will give the above reward for
  his confinement in some jail in the State, so that I can get him.
  Refer, for any further information, to Rabun & Whitehead, Savannah,
  Ga.

From these advertisements, and hundreds of similar ones, one may learn
the following things:

1. That the arguments for the enslaving of the negro do not apply to a
large part of the actual slaves.

2. That they are not, in the estimation of their masters, very stupid.

3. That they are not remarkably contented.

4. That they have no particular reason to be so.

5. That multitudes of men claiming to be free are constantly being sold
into slavery.
