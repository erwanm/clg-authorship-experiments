tives may be pure." 

" It is very possible that his motives are pure ; I 
should be very sorry to take the contrary for grant- 
ed. Lavinia is sure of it; and, as he is a very pre- 
possessing youth, you might give him the benefit of 
the doubt." 

Doctor Sloper reflected a moment. 

" "What are his present means of subsistence ?" 

" I have no idea. He lives, as I say, with his sister." 

" A widow, with five children ? Do you mean he 
lives upon her ?" 

Mrs. Almond got up, and with a certain impa- 
tience, " Had you not better ask Mrs. Montgomery 
herself ?" she inquired. 

" Perhaps I may come to that," said the Doctor. 
"Did you say the Second Avenue?" He made a 
note of the Second Avenue. 







 



VII. 




HE was, however, by no means so much in earnest 
as this might seem to indicate ; and, indeed, he was 
more than anything else amused with the whole sit- 
uation. He was not in the least in a state of tension 
or of vigilance with regard to Catherine's prospects ; 
he was even on his guard against the ridicule that 
might attach itself to the spectacle of a house 




thrown into agitation by its daughter and heiress 
receiving attentions unprecedented in its annals. 
More than this, he went so far as to promise him- 
self some entertainment from the little drama if 
drama it was of which Mrs. Penniman desired to 
represent the ingenious Mr. Townsend as the hero. 
He had no intention, as yet, of regulating the denoue 
ment. He was perfectly willing, as Elizabeth had 
suggested, to give the young man the benefit of ev- 
ery doubt. There was no great danger in it; for 
Catherine, at the age of twenty-two, was, after all, a 
rather mature blossom, such as could be plucked from 
the stem only by a vigorous jerk. The fact that 
Morris Townsend was poor, was not of necessity 
against him ; the Doctor had never made up his 
mind that his daughter should marry a rich man. 
The fortune she would inherit struck him as a very 
sufficient provision for two reasonable persons, and 
if a penniless swain who could give a good account 
of himself should enter the lists, he should be judged 
quite upon his personal merits. There were other 
things besides. The Doctor thought it very vulgar 
to be precipitate in accusing people of mercenary 
motives, inasmuch as his door had as yet not been 
in the least besieged by fortune-hunters ; and, lastly, 
he was very curious to see whether Catherine might 
really be loved for her moral worth. He smiled as 
he reflected that poor Mr. Townsend had been only 
twice to the house, and he said to Mrs. Penniman 
that the next time he should come she must ask him 
to dinner. 

He came very soon again, and Mrs. Penniman had 
of course great pleasure in executing this mission. 





Morris Townsend accepted her invitation with equal 
good grace, and the dinner took place a few days 
later. The Doctor had said to himself, justly 
enough, that they must not have the young man 
alone ; this would partake too much of the nature of 
encouragement. So two or three other persons were 
invited; but Morris Townsend, though he was by 
no means the ostensible, was the real occasion of the 
feast. There is every reason to suppose that he de- 
sired to make a good impression ; and if he fell short 
of this result, it was not for want of a good deal of 
intelligent effort. The Doctor talked to him very 
little during dinner ; but he observed him attentive- 
ly, and after the ladies had gone out he pushed him 
the wine and asked him several questions. Morris 
was not a young man who needed to be pressed, and 
he found quite enough encouragement in the supe- 
rior quality of the claret. The Doctor's wine was 
admirable, and it may be communicated to the read- 
er that while he sipped it Morris reflected that a cel- 
larful of good liquor there was evidently a cellar- 
ful here would be a most attractive idiosyncrasy 
in a father-in-law. The Doctor was struck with his 
appreciative guest ; he saw that he was not a com- 
monplace young man. " He has ability," said Cathe- 
rine's father, " decided ability ; he has a very good 
head if he chooses to use it. And he is uncommon- 
ly well turned out; quite the sort of figure that 
pleases the ladies ; but I don't think I like him." 
The Doctor, however, kept his reflections to himself, 
and talked to his visitors about foreign lands, con- 
cerning which Morris offered him more information 
than he was ready, as he mentally phrased it, to 





swallow. Doctor Sloper had travelled but little, and 
he took the liberty of not believing everything that 
his talkative guest narrated. He prided himself on 
being something of a physiognomist ; and while the 
young man, chatting with easy assurance, puffed his 
cigar and filled his glass again, the Doctor sat with 
his eyes quietly fixed on his bright, expressive face. 
" He has the assurance of the devil himself !" said 
Morris's host ; " I don't think I ever saw such assur- 
ance. And his powers of invention are most re- 
markable. He is very knowing ; they were not so 
knowing as that in my time. And a good head, did
