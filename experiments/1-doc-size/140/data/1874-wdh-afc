A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. 



trying to believe that this unlmman, sacerdotal 
phantasm had been telling him that it loved a 
beautiful young girl of his own race, faith, and 
language. 

" Will you not answer me, signore ? " meekly de 
manded Don Ippolito. 

" In this matter," replied the painter, " I cannot 
advise or warn you. The whole affair is beyond my 
conception. I mean no unkindness, but I cannot 
consult with you about it. There are reasons why 
I should not. The mother of Miss Vervain is here 
with her, and I do not feel that her interests in 
such a matter are in my hands. If they come to 
me for help, that is different. What do you wish ? 
You tell me that you are resolved to renounce the 
priesthood and go to America ; and I have answered 
you to the best of my power. You tell me that 
you are in love with Miss Vervain. What can I 
have to say about that ? " 

Don Ippolito stood listening with a patient, and 
then a wounded air. " Nothing," he answered 
proudly. " I ask your pardon for troubling you 
with my affairs. Your former kindness emboldened 
me too much. I shall not trespass again. It was 
my ignorance, which I pray you to excuse. I take; 
my leave, signore." 

He bowed, and moved out of the room, and a 
dull remorse filled the painter, as he heard the outer 
door close after him. But he could do nothing. 
He had given a wound to the heart that trusted 


him, it was in an anguish which he had not been 
able to master, and whose causes he could not yet 
define. It was all a shapeless torment ; it held him 
like the memory of some hideous nightmare pro 
longing its horror beyond sleep. It seemed impos 
sible that what had happened should have hap 
pened. 

It was long, as he sat in the chair from which he 
had talked with Don Ippolito, before he could rea 
son about what had been said ; and then the worst 
phase presented itself first. He could not help see 
ing that the priest might have found cause for hope 
in the girl's behavior toward him. Her violent re 
sentments, and her equally violent repentances ; her 
fervent interest in his unhappy fortunes, and her 
anxiety that he should at once forsake the priest 
hood ; her urging him to go to America, and her 
promising him a home under her mother's roof 
there : why might it not all be in fact a proof of 
her tenderness for him ? She might have found it 
necessary to be thus coarsely explicit with him, for 
a man in Don Ippolito's relation to her could not 
otherwise have imagined her interest in him. But 
her making use of Ferris to confirm her own pur 
poses by his words, her repeating them so that they 
should come back to him from Don Ippolito's lips, 
her letting another man go with her to look upon 
the procession in which her priestly lover was to 
appear in his sacerdotal panoply ; these things could 
not be accounted for except by that strain of inso- 



 

lent, passionate defiance which lie had noted in her 
from the beginning:. Whv should she first tell Don 



Ippolito of their going away ? " Well, I wish him 
joy of his bargain," said Ferris aloud, and rising, 
shrugged his shoulders, and tried to cast off all care 
of a matter that did not concern him. But one 
does not so easily cast off a matter that does not 
concern one. He found himself haunted by certain 
tones and looks and attitudes of the young girl, 
wholly alien to the character he had just constructed 
for her. They were child-like, trusting, uncon 
scious, far beyond anything he had yet known in 
women, and they appealed to him now with a mad 
dening pathos. She was standing there before Don 
Ippolito's picture as on that morning when she 
came to Ferris, looking anxiously at him, her inno 
cent beauty, troubled with some hidden care, hal 
lowing the place. Ferris thought of the young 
fellow who told him that he had spent three months 
in a dull German town because he had the room 
there that was once occupied by the girl who had 
refused him ; the painter remembered that the 
young fellow said he had just read of her marriage 
in an American newspaper. 

Why did Miss Vervain send Don Ippolito to him ? 
Was it some scheme of her secret love for the 
priest ; or mere coarse resentment of the cautions 
Ferris had once hinted, a piece of vulgar bravado ? 
But if she had acted throughout in pure simplicity, 
in unwise goodness of heart ? If Don Ippolito 



 

were altogether self-deceived, and nothing but her 
unknowing pity had given him grounds of hope ? 
He himself had suggested this to the priest, and 
now with a different motive he looked at it in his 
own behalf. A great load began slowly to lift it 
self from Ferris's heart, which could ache now for 
this most unhappy priest. But if his conjecture 
were just, his duty would be different. He must 
not coldly acquiesce and let things take their course. 
He had introduced Don Ippolito to the Vervains ; 
he was in some sort responsible for him ; he must 
save them if possible from the painful consequences 
of the priest's hallucination. But how to do this 
was by no means clear. He blamed himself for 
not having been franker with Don Ippolito and 
tried to make him see that the Vervains might re 
gard his passion as a presumption upon their kind 
ness to him, an abuse of their hospitable friendship ; 
and yet how could he have done this without out 
rage to a sensitive and right-meaning soul ? For a
