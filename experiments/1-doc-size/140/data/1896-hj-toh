that everyone has thought you probably would?" 

" Certainly, I've known it, and that's why I'm 
glad of our talk. It ought to have come sooner. 
You thought I probably would, I think " 

" Oh, yes ! " Paul artlessly broke in. 



 

Jean laughed again while she wiped her eyes. 
" That's why I call you beautiful. You had my 
possible expectation to meet." 

" Oh, yes ! " he said again. 

"And you were to meet it like a gentleman. 
I might have but no matter. You risked your 
life you've been magnificent." Jean got up. 
"And now, to make it perfect, you must take 
this back." 

She put the morocco case into his submissive 
hand, and he sat staring at it and mechanically 
turning it round. Unconsciously, musingly, he 
threw it a little way into the air and caught it 
again. Then he also got up. "They'll be tre 
mendously down on us." 

" On ' us ' ? On me, of course but why on 
you?" 

"For not having moved you." 

"You've moved me immensely. Before me 
let no one say a word about you ! " 

"It's of no consequence," Paul repeated. 

"Nothing is, if we go on as we are. We're 
better friends than ever. And we're happy!" 
Jean announced in her triumph. 

He looked at her with deep wistfulness, with 
patient envy. " You are ! " Then his eyes took 





the direction to which her attention at that 
moment passed : they showed him Tony Bream 
coming up the slope with his little girl in his 
hand. Jean went down instantly to welcome 
the child, and Paul turned away with a grave 
face, giving at the same time another impulsive 
toss to the case containing the token she had 
declined.

HE directed his face to the house, however, 
only to find himself in the presence of his 
mother, who had come back to her tea-table 
and whom he saw veritably glare at the small 
object in his hands. From this object her scru 
tiny jumped to his own countenance, which, to 
his great discomfort, was not conscious of very 
successfully baffling it. He knew therefore a 
momentary relief when her observation attached 
itself to Jean Martle, whom Tony, planted on 
the lawn, was also undisguisedly watching, and 
who was already introducing Erne to the treasure 
laid up in the shade of the tea-table. The girl 
had caught up the child on her strong young 
arm, where she sat robust and radiant, befrilled 
and besashed, hugging the biggest of the dolls ; 
and in this position erect, active, laughing, her 
rosy burden, almost on her shoulder, mingling its 
brightness with that of her crown of hair, and her 



other hand grasping, for Effie's further delight, in 
the form of another puppet from the pile, a still 
rosier imitation of it anticipated quickly the 
challenge which, as Paul saw, Mrs. Beever was 
on the point of addressing her. 

"Our wonderful cake's not coming out?" 

"It's too big to transport," said Mrs. Beever: 
"it's blazing away in the dining-room." 

Jean Martle turned to Tony. "I may carry 
her in to see it?" 

Tony assented. "Only please remember she's 
not to partake." 

Jean smiled at him. " I'll eat her share ! " 
And she passed swiftly over the lawn while the 
three pairs of eyes followed her. 

" She looks," said Tony, " like the goddess 
Diana playing with a baby-nymph." 

Mrs. Beever's attention came back to her son. 
"That's the sort of remark one would expect to 
hear from you! You're not going with her?" 

Paul showed vacant and vast. " I'm going in." 

"To the dining-room?" 

He wavered. "To speak to Miss Armiger." 

His mother's gaze, sharpened and scared, had 
reverted to his morocco case. "To ask her to 
keep that again?" 



 

At this Paul met her with spirit. "She may 
keep it for ever ! " Giving another toss to his 
missile, while his companions stared at each 
other, he took the same direction as Jean. 

Mrs. Beever, disconcerted and flushed, broke 
out on the spot to Tony. " Heaven help us all 
she has refused him ! " 

Tony's face reflected her alarm. "Pray, how 
do you know ? "
