to be held." 

" That's nothing new. He never could be held. 
Pity we didn't name him Boreas." 

" But do you see what he is doing ? " 

" No." 

" He is off to see that child." 



 

" That child to-day, and another to-morrow. He's 
a boy yet." 

" Hildebrand, I tell you, there is danger." 

" Danger of what ? " 

" Of what you would not like." 

"My dear, young men do not fall dangerously in 
love with children. And that little girl is a child 
yet." 

" You forget how soon she will be not a child. 
And she is going to be a very remarkable looking 
girl, I can tell you. And you must not forget 
another thing, husband ; that Pitt is as persistent 
as he is wilful." 

" He's got a head, I think," said Mr. Dallas, stroking his whiskers thoughtfully. 

" That won't save him. It never saved anybody. 
Men with heads are just as much fools, in certain 
circumstances, as men without them." 

" He might fancy s@rne other child in England, 
if we sent him there, you know." 

" Yes, but at least she would be a Church wo 
man," said Mrs. Dallas, with her handsome face all 
cloudy and disturbed. 

Meanwhile her son had rushed along the village 
street, or road rather, through the cold and dark 
ness, the quarter of a mile to Col. Gainsborough's 
house. There he was told that the colonel had a 
bad headache and was already gone to his room. 

" Is Miss Esther up ? " 

"0 yes, sir," said Mrs. Barker doubtfully, but 
she did not invite the visiter in. 





" Can I see her for a moment ? " 

" I haven't no,orders, but I suppose you can come 
in, Mr. Dallas. It is Mr. Dallas, aint it?" 

" Yes, it's I, Mrs. Barker," said Pitt coming in 
and beginning at once to throw off his great coat. 
" In the usual room ? Is the colonel less well than 
common ? " 

" Well, no, sir, not to call less well, as I knows 
on. It's the time o year, sir, I make bold to imagine. He has a headache bad, that he has, and he's 
gone off to bed ; but Miss Esther's well so as she 
can be." 

Pitt got out of his great coat and gloves and 
waited for no more. He had a certain vague 
expectation of the delight his appearance would 
give, and was a little eager to see it. So he went 
in with a bright face to surprise Esther. 

The girl was sitting by the table, reading a book 
she had laid close under the lamp; reading with 
a very grave face, Pitt saw too, and it a little 
sobered the brightness of his own. It was not the 
dullness of stagnation or of sorrow this time; at 
least Esther was certainly busily reading; but it 
was sober, steady business, not the absorption of 
happy interest or excitement. She looked up care 
lessly as the door opened, then half incredulously 
as she saw the entering figure, then she shut her 
book and rose to meet him. But then she did not 
shew the lively pleasure he had expected ; her face 
Hushed a little, she hardly smiled, she met him as 
if he were more or less a stranger; with much more 



 

dignity and less eagerness than he was accustomed 
to from her. Pitt was astonished, and piqued, 
and curious. However he followed her lead, in a 
measure. 

" How do you do, Queen Esther ? " he said, hold 
ing out his hand. 

" How do you do, Pitt ? " she answered, taking 
it; but with the oddest mingling of reserve and 
doubt in her manner; and the great grave eyes 
were lifted to his face for a moment, with, it seemed 
to him, something of inquiry or questioning in 
them. 

" Are you not glad to see me ? " 

" Yes " she said with another glance. 

" Then why are you not glad to see me ? " he 
asked impetuously. 

"I am glad to see you of course," she said. 
" Won't you sit down ? " 

" This won't do, you know," said the young man, 
half vexed and half laughing, but wholly determined 
not to be kept at a distance in this manner. " I 
am not going to sit down, if you are going to treat 
me like that." 

" Treat you how ? " 

" Why, as if I were a stranger, that you didn't 
care a pin about. What's the matter, Queen Esther ? " 

Esther was silent. Pitt was half indignant; and 
then he caught the shimmer of something like
