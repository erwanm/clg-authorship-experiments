the room.

Leilah, meanwhile, rising from the sofa where she had been seated,
moved with the inflammatory d’Arcy into the salon beyond.

Barouffski would have followed. But the young Baronne de Fresnoy
addressed him. Perversely, with sudden glimpses of little teeth and an
expression of glee in her piquant face, she asked:

“Was it you who performed that high act of gallantry at Longchamps
to-day?”

“Was it I who did what?” Barouffski surprisedly exclaimed.

“What was it?” asked Aurelia, who with Buttercups in tow, had
approached.

But Mme. de Fresnoy waved at her. “Go away my dear, it is not for an
ingénue.”

“Ah then, but you see,” Aurelia indolently interjected, “I am tired of
being an ingénue. An ingénue is supposed to be in a state of constant
surprise and that is so exhausting.”

None the less, with Buttercups still in tow she betook herself to a
corner where she was promptly joined by Farnese.

Then at once to Barouffski, to Mustim Pasha, to the Helley-Quetgens,
to others that stood about, the young baroness related a morsel of
gossip, the report of which had been brought her but a moment before,
a story that had one of the reigning demireps for heroine and for hero
a man unidentified by the baronne’s informant, the tale of an assault
committed before all Paris, before all Paris that is, that happened
to be at the races that day; an extravaganza in which the heroine,
erupting suddenly on the pelouse before the Grand Stand, had, with her
parasol, struck the hero over the head and had been about to strike him
again, when he, pinioning her arms with his own, had to the applause
of everybody, prevented the second assault by kissing her through
her veil; after which releasing the lady, he had raised his hat and
strolled away.

“Was it you, Barouffski?” Mme. de Fresnoy, the narrative at an end,
inquired. “Was it?”

“I? Nonsense! Why should you ask?”

“It would be just like you, you know. Besides, I hear that the man was
tall and good-looking.”

“You are exceedingly complimentary. But the world is peopled with tall,
good-looking men.”

“Pas tant que ça,” laughed the baroness. “Well, if it was not you,
perhaps it was that man who is just coming in.”

Involuntarily Barouffski turned, while a footman bawled:

“Monsieur Verplank!”




III


It was in circumstances which, if not dramatic, were, at least,
uncommon, that Leilah Verplank met Barouffski.

At Los Angeles, after her flight from Coronado, she caught an express
that would have taken her East. Even so, it could not take her from
herself, it could not distance memory, it could not annihilate the
past. The consciousness of that obsessed her. Each of her thoughts
became a separate throb. About her head formed an iron band. Her body
ached. She felt hot and ill. She had a sense of thirst, a sense, too,
of fear.

In the compartment where she sat, a stranger came. She hid her face,
covering it with her hands. The stranger sidled in between them, looked
her in the eyes, penetrated them, permeated her, shook long shudders
through her, shrieked at her: “I am Fright!”

She cried aloud. No one heard. She got to the door.

In the section immediately adjoining were her women. Perplexed at the
start by her unaccountable flight and, since then, alarmed by the
abnormal excitability which she had displayed, both, at the sight of
her then, rushed to her.

Salt Lake was the first possible asylum. There, weeks later, Leilah
arose from one of those attacks, which, for lack of a better term, has
been called brain fever.

Like fire, fever may consume, it does not necessarily obliterate. The
past remained. But in that lassitude which fever leaves, Leilah was
able to consider it with a wearied certainty that no immediate effort
could be required of her then.

“Forget,” some considerate and subliminal self admonished. “Forget.”

Even in sleep she could not always do that. But though she could not
forget the past, she could, she believed, barricade herself against it.
The idea was suggested by the local sheet in which she found an item
about neighbourly Nevada. The item hung a hammock for her thoughts,
rested her mentally, unrolled a carpet for the returning steps of
health.

Verplank, meanwhile, misdirected at Los Angeles, reached San Francisco.
Learning there that a party of three women had, that morning, at the
last moment, embarked on the Samoa packet; learning also that of these
women the central figure projected, or seemed to project, Leilah’s
silhouette, he wired for his yacht and sailed away in pursuit. But
an accident supervening, the packet reached Samoa before him. When
Verplank got there the boat was gone. Still in pursuit he started for
the austral seas. There, the mistake discovered, hope for the time
abandoned him and he landed in Melbourne, ignorant that the supremely
surgical court of Nevada was amputating him from his wife.

In matters of this solemnity, the Nevada statutes require that one of
the parties to the operation shall have resided for six months within
the state. But at Carson, the capital, a town that has contrived to
superpose the Puritan aspect of a New England village on the vices of
a Malay port, in this city Leilah learned that statutes so severe were
not enacted for such as she.

The information, tolerably consoling, was placed before her by a young
Jew who, as she alighted from the train, divined her errand, addressed
her with easy Western informality, put a card in her hand, offered his
services, telling her as he did so that if she retained him he would
have her free in no time, in three months, in less. It was a mere
matter of money, he explained, and, what he did not explain, a mere
matter of perjury as well, the perjury of local oafs ready to swear
to whatever they were paid for, ready to testify for instance that
they had known anybody for any required length of time. But the Jew in
divining Leilah’s errand divined too her loyalty. In speaking of fees,
he kept manœuvres and methods to himself.

Leilah, repelled yet beguiled, succumbed. The Jew was retained and in
a wretched inn her things were unpacked. At once a rain of days began,
long, loveless days in which she tried to starve her thoughts into
submission and bear the cross that had been brought.
