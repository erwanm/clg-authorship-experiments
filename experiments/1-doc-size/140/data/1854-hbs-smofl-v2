or come apart, like a German doll, if not managed with extremest care; and therefore to see one bounding through 
bushes, leaping, and springing, and climbing over rocks at such 
a rate, appeared to him the height of desperation. 

The good, faithful soul wanted to keep me within orthodox 
limits, and felt conscientiously bound to follow me wherever 
I went, and to offer me his hand at every turn. I considered, on the whole, that I ought not to blame him, since 
guides hold themselves responsible for life and limb ; and any 
accident to those under their charge is fatal to their professional honor. 

Going down, I held some conversation with him on matters 







and things in general, and life in Chamouni in particular. He 
inquired with great interest about America ; which, throughout Europe, I find the working classes regard as a kind of 
star in the west, portending something of good to themselves. He had a son, he said, settled in. America, near St. 
Louis. 

"And don't you want to go to America?" said I, after 
hearing him praise the good land. 
" Ah, no," he said, with a smile. 

" Why not ? " said I ; " it is a much easier country to 
live in." 

He gave a look at the circle of mountains around, and said, 
"I love Chamouni." The good soul! I was much of his 
opinion. If I had been born within sight of glorious Mont 
Blanc, with its apocalyptic clouds, and store of visions, not all 
the fat pork and flat prairies of Indiana and Ohio could tempt 
me. No wonder the Swiss die for their native valleys ! I 
would if I were they. I asked him about education. He 
said his children went to a school kept by Catholic sisters, 
who taught reading, writing, and Latin. The dialect of Chamouni is a patois, composed of French and Latin. He said 
that provision was very scarce in the winter. I asked how 
they made their living when there were no travellers to be 
guided up Mont Blanc. He had a trade at which he wrought 
in winter months, and his wife did tailoring. 

I must not forget to say that the day before there had been 
some confidential passages between us, which began by his 
expressing, interrogatively, the opinion that " mademoiselle 
was a young lady, he supposed." When mademoiselle had 
assured him, on the contrary, that she was a venerable ma- 
 







tron, mother of a thriving family, then followed a little com- 
parison of notes as to numbers. Madame he ascertained to 
have six, and he had four, if my memory serves me, as it 
generally does not in matters of figures. So you see it is not 
merely among us New Englanders that the unsophisticated 
spirit of curiosity exists as to one's neighbors. Indeed, I 
take it to be a wholesome development of human nature in 
general. For my part, I could not think highly of any body 
who could be brought long into connection with another hu- 
man being and feel no interest to inquire into his history 
and surroundings. 

As we stopped, going down the descent, to rest the mules, 
I looked up above my head into the crags, and saw a flock of 
goats browsing. One goat, in particular, I remember, had 
gained the top of a kind of table rock, which stood apart 
from the rest, and which was carpeted with lichens and green 
moss. There he stood, looking as unconscious and contem- 
plative as possible, the wicked fellow, with his long beard ! 
He knew he looked picturesque, and that is what he stood 
there for. But, as they say in New England, he did it " as 
naCral as a pictur t " 

By the by, the girls with strawberries, milk, and knitting 
work were on hand on the way down, and met us just where 
a cool spring gushed out at the roots of a pine tree ; and of 
course I bought some more milk and strawberries. 

How dreadfully hot it was when we got down to the bottom ! for there we had the long, shadeless ride home, with the 
burning lenses of the glaciers concentrated upon our defenceless heads. I was past admiring any thing, and glad enough 
for the shelter of a roof, and a place to lie down. 

After dinner, although the Glacier de Boisson had been 







spoken of as the appointed work for the afternoon, yet we 
discovered, as the psalm book says, that 

" The force of nature could no farther go." 

"What is Glacier de Boisson, or glacier any thing else, to a 
person used up entirely, with no sense or capability left for 




any thing but a general aching? No ; the Glacier de Boisson 
was given up, and I am sorry for it now, because it is the 
commencement of the road up Mont Blanc ; and, though I 
could not go to the top thereof, I should like to have gone as 







far as I could. In fact, I should have been glad to sleep one 
night at the Grands Mulets : however, that was impossible. 

To look at the apparently smooth surface of the mountain 
side, one would never think that the ascent could be a work 
of such difficulty and danger. Yet, look at the picture of 
crossing a crevasse, and compare the size of the figures with 
the dimensions of the blocks of ice. Madame d'Angeville 
told me that she was drawn across a crevasse like this, by 
ropes tied under her arms, by the guides. The depth of some 
of the crevasses may be conjectured from the fact stated by 
Agassiz, that the thickest parts of the glaciers are over one 
thousand feet in depth. 




Friday, July 8. â€” Chamouni to Martigny, by Tete Noir. 
Mules en avant. We set off in a caliche. After a two hours' 
ride we came to " those mules" On, to the pass of Tete Noir, 
by paths the most awful. As my mule trod within six inches
