" Yes, I'm a perfect martyr to it," said the lady. 

" Juniper-berry tea is good for sick-headache," said Miss 
Ophelia ; " at least, Augustine, Deacon Abraham Perry's 
wife, used to say so ; and she was a great nurse." 

" I'll have the first juniper-berries that get ripe in our 
garden by the lake brought in for that especial purpose," 
said St. Clare, gravely pulling the bell as he did so; 
" meanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting to retire to your 







apartment, and refresh yourself a little after your journey. 
Dolph," he added, " tell Mammy to come here." The decent 
mulatto woman whom Eva had caressed so rapturously soon 
entered ; she was dressed neatly, with a high red and yellow 
turban on her head, the recent gift of Eva, and which the 
child had been arranging on her head. " Mammy," said St. 
Clare, " I put this lady under your care ; she is tired, and 
wants rest. Take her to her chamber, and be sure she is 
made comfortable;" and Miss Ophelia disappeared in the 
rear of Mammy. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

TOM'S MISTRESS AND HER OPINIONS. 

"AND now, Marie," said St. Clare, "your golden days are 
dawning. Here is our practical, business-like New England 
cousin, who will take the whole budget of cares off your 
shoulders, and give you time to refresh yourself, and grow 
young and handsome. The ceremony of delivering the keys 
had better come off forthwith." 

This remark was made at the breakfast-table, a few 
mornings after Miss Ophelia had arrived. 

" I'm sure she's welcome," said Marie, leaning her head 
languidly on her hand. " I think she'll find one thing, if she 
does, and that is, that it's we mistresses that are the slaves, 
down here." 

" Oh, certainly, she will discover that, and a world of 
wholesome truths besides, no doubt," said St. Clare. 

" Talk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our 
convenience'' said Marie. " I'm sure, if we consulted that, 
we might let them all go at once." 

Evangeline fixed her large, serious eyes on her mother's 
face, with an earnest and perplexed expression, and said 
simply, " What do you keep them for, mamma ? " 

" I don't know, I'm sure, except for a plague ; they are 
the plague of my life. I believe that more of my ill- 
health is caused by them than by any one thing ; and 





ours, I know, are the very worst that ever anybody was 
plagued with." 

" Oh, come, Marie, you've got the blues this morning," 
said St. Clare. " You know 'tisn't so. There's Mammy, the 
best creature living what could you do without her ? " 

" Mammy is the best I ever knew," said Marie ; " and 
yet Mammy, now, is selfish dreadfully selfish ; it's the fault 
of the whole race." 

" Selfishness is a dreadful fault," said St. Clare, gravely. 

" Well, now, there's Mammy," said Marie ; " I think it's 
selfish of her to sleep so sound nights ; she knows I need 
little attentions almost every hour, when my worst turns are 
on, and yet she's so hard to wake. I absolutely am worse, 
this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her 
last night." 

" Hasn't she sat up with you a good many nights lately, 
mamma ? " said Eva. 

" How should you know that ? " said Marie, sharply ; 
" she's been complaining, I suppose." 

" She didn't complain ; she only told me what bad nights 
you'd had so many in succession ! " 

" Why don't you let Jane or Rosa take her place a night 
or two," said St. Clare, "and let her rest ? " 

" How can you propose it ? " said Marie. " St. Clare, 
you really are inconsiderate ! So nervous as I am, the least 
breath disturbs me ; and a strange hand about me would 
drive me absolutely frantic. If Mammy felt the interest in 
me she ought to, she'd wake easier of course she would. 
I've heard of people who had such devoted servants,, but it 
never was my luck ; " and Marie sighed. 

Miss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air 
of shrewd, observant gravity ; and she still kept her lips 
tightly compressed, as if. determined fully to ascertain her 
longitude and position, before she committed herself. 

" Now, Mammy has a sort of goodness," said Marie ; 
"she's smooth and respectful, but she's selfish at heart. 
Now, she never will be done fidgeting and worrying about 
that husband of hers. You see, when 1 was married and 
came to live here, of course I had to bring her with me, and 
her husband, my father couldn't spare. He was a black- 
smith, and, of course, very necessary ; and I thought and 





said, at the time, that Mammy and he had better give each 
other up, as it wasn't likely to be convenient for them ever 
to live together again. I wish now I'd insisted on it, and 
married Mammy to somebody else ; but I was foolish and 
indulgent, and didn't want to insist. I told Mammy at the 
time that she musn't ever expect to see him more than once 
or twice in her life again, for the air of father's place doesn't 
agree with my health, and I can't go there ; and I advised 
her to take up with somebody else ; but no she wouldn't. 
Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her, in spots, that 
everybody don't see as I do." 

" Has she children ? " said Miss Ophelia. 

" Yes ; she has two."
