parish, who is not in possession of ground enough 
to make his farming suffice for the wants of his family, and who therefore would willingly hire some 
more acres. He offers to take the neglected field 
off the pastor's hands. The upright pastor does 
not hide from him the reason why the field has 
hitherto found no tenant. But this man, who loves 
the Lord Jesus, and who therefore is a hearty friend 
of his pastor, declares that he has already quietly 
considered all that; and he has thought among 
other things that it must be very important to the 
pastor to let out this field, for to be sure the boys 
cost money; and it is very desirable for himself to 



 

hire a field, since he also has a great many mouths 
to feed. So both of them would be the better off. 
The Lord must have the care of the tiling, and 
that he is well able for; he himself also would 
pray the Lord faithfully to this end, and he would 
make it the one stipulation with his beloved pastor, 
that he would stand by him and help him in faithful prayer. The two men gave each other the hand 
upon that. The man hiring the ground had also 
told the Lord that he would give him a portion of 
the produce of the field for the conversion of the 
heathen, and that all the same whether the produce were much or little. But the man had said 
nothing about this to his pastor, and he again on 
the other side had said nothing to the man about 
his own contract with the Lord; so that each of 
them had thus kept in his heart a secret for himself, which was known to the Lord alone. But 
surely I know that the Lord thereupon looked 
kindly on both the men. 

" Now in the autumn the farmer sets himself 
vigorously to work to get the field in order; and 
the Lord gives his blessing upon it ; up comes the 
seed merrily, and the winter does it no hurt; the 
Lord has graciously sheltered it. With a wet summer the corn really shoots up, and stands so fine 
that it is magnificent to see. Both pastor and 
farmer are heartily glad at the sight, and both at 
the same time have a secret recollection of their 
vow, and are still more glad. But many of the 
peasants, who are not lovers of the Lord, and therefore also not lovers of their good pastor, and of the 
good farmer as little, feel no pleasure, but a regular 
hateful grudge in their hearts; for indeed there is 
everywhere a plenty of envy and spite to be found 
among unbelievers, because they make their god 
out of what is earthly and that is all they care 
about. However they comfort themselves with the 
thought that when the thunder-showers once come 
with their violent rain-pours, then surely there will 
be stones and soil enough rolling down upon the 
field from off the hill in the end to destroy all that 
is standing upon it. Verily that is not a godly sort 
of satisfaction, but a true Satanic delight, for Satan 
rejoices when any evil happens to people. 

" And at last, the wish of the peasants seems 
to be fulfilled. There comes up an uncommonly 
violent thunder-storm; the rain pours down from 
heaven in streams, as if the clouds had burst; so 
that regular brooks are flowing down the village 
streets. Then the envious people triumph; there 
is no mistake about it, the field lying so exposed 
on the slope of the hill, must be thoroughly laid 
waste. Those two men, it may well be, tremble 
too, for the storm is too frightful; but lose heart 
they do not; on the contrary the need drives them 
to more ardent prayer: "Lord, help, and do not let 
the field be spoiled. Thou art the strong, almighty 
God of Sabaoth, and thy hand is not shortened, but 
thine arm is stretched out still." So they prayed; 
and when the storm was past they went confidently up to the field, a good many accompanying 



 

them ; and as they were going, and while the many 
who went along could hardly hide their delight, 
they were singing in their hearts the hymn 



me j n Gott will gescheh allzeit, 
Sein Wille 1st der beste ; 
Zu helfen ist Er dem bereit, 
Der an Urn glaubet feste." ' " 

" Ditto, we don't understand that." 

" It means about this. * The will of my God be 
done always. His will is the best. He is always 
ready to help them who rest on him in firm faith.' " 

"'With that, they are able to look up cheerfully 
and they are of good courage. And when they 
arrive at the field, what do they see? The entire 
field is unharmed. The stalks of grain lift their 
heads up bravely, as if they too would give thanks 
for the beautiful rain which has so refreshed them. 
But on both sides of the field a whole stream has 
poured down from the hill, and nothing is to be 
seen but a wild mass of rocks and stones. Whose 
is the strong hand which seized the rain flood and 
parted it just before it came to the field and so gently led it down on both sides of the field ? Moved 
to the depth of their hearts, our two friends were 
constrained to cry out "The Lord, he is the God! 
The Lord, he is the God! Give our God the glory." 
And it is to be hoped that many of the unbelievers, 
if not aloud yet quietly, joined in the prayer with 
them. 

" And now, when the harvest was finished, and 
the farmer brought to the pastor what he had prom- 



 

ised to give the Lord of the produce of the field, 
and then also the pastor's vow was made known 
to the farmer, the two fell upon their knees again 
and thanked the Lord for his goodness, because 
his mercy endureth forever. Must not such gifts 
to the heathen go with God's special blessing resting upon them ? ' ' 

" Is that all ? " said Maggie. 

" That is all," said Meredith smiling. 

"I do not know what to make of that story," 
said Flora. 

"Why?? 

" Storms come from natural causes."
