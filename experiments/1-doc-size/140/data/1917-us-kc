Valley. 

But conspirators cannot lend themselves long to merri- 
ment. They came back to business again. It was agreed 
that the hour for the committee's visit to the superintend- 
ent should be quitting-time on the morrow. And then 
John Edstrom spoke, suggesting that they should agree 
upon their course of action in case they were offered vio- 
lence. 

" You think there's much chance of that ? " said some 
one. 

" Sure there be ! " cried Mike Sikoria. " One time in 
Cedar Mountain we go see boss, say air-course blocked. 
What you think he do them fellers? He hit them one 
lick in nose, he kick them three times in behind, he run 
them out ! " 

" Well," said Hal, " if there's going to be anything like 
that, we must be ready." 

" What you do ? " demanded Jerry. 

It was time for Hal's leadership. " If he hits me one 
lick in the nose," he declared, " I'll hit him one lick in 
the nose, that's all." 

There was a bit of applause at this. That was the way 
to talk ! Hal tasted the joys of his leadership. But then 
his fine self-confidence met with a sudden check — a " lick 
in the nose" of his pride, so to speak. There came a 
woman's voice from the corner, low and grim : " Yes ! 
And get ye'self killed for all your trouble ! " 

He looked towards Mary Burke, and saw her vivid face, 
flushed and frowning. " What do you mean ? " he asked. 
" Would you have us turn and run away ? " 

" I would that ! " said she. " Rather than have ye 
killed, I would! What'll ye do if he pulls his gun on 
ye?" 

" Would he pull his gun on a committee ? " 

Old Mike broke in again. " One time in Barela — 



 

ain't I told you how I lose my oars? I tell weigh-boss 
somebody steal my cars, and he pull gun on me, and he 
say, ' Get the hell off that tipple, you old billy-goat, I 
shoot you full of holes ! ' " 

Among his class-mates at college, Hal had been wont to 
argue that the proper way to handle a burglar was to call 
out to him, saying, " Go ahead, old chap, and help your- 
self ; there's nothing here I'm willing to get shot for." 
What was the value of anything a burglar could steal, in 
comparison with a man's own life? And surely, one 
would have thought, this was a good time to apply the 
plausible theory. But for some reason Hal failed even to 
remember it. He was going ahead, precisely as if a ton 
of coal per day was the one thing of consequence in life ! 

" What shall we do ? " he asked. " We don't want to 
back out." 

But even while he asked the question, Hal was realising 
that Mary was right. His was the attitude of the leisure- 
class person, used to having his own way; but Mary, 
though she had a temper too, was pointing the lesson of 
self-control. It was the second time to-night that she had 
injured his pride. But now he forgave her in his ad- 
miration; he had always known that Mary had a mind 
and could help him! His admiration was increased by 
what John Edstrom was saying — they must do nothing 
that would injure the cause of the " big union," and so 
they must resolve to offer no physical resistance, no matter 
what might be done to them. 

There was vehement argument on the other side. " We 
fight ! We fight ! " declared Old Mike, and cried out sud- 
denly, as if in anticipation of the pain in his injured 
nose. " You say me stand that ? " 

" If you fight back," said Edstrom, " we'll all get the 
worst of it. The company will say we started the trouble, 
and put us in the wrong. We've got to make up our mind 
to rely on moral force." 



 

So, after more discussion, it was agreed; every man 
would keep his temper — that is, if he could! So they 
shook hands all round, pledging themselves to stand firm. 
But, when the meeting was declared adjourned, and they 
stole out one by one into the night, they were a very sober 
and anxious lot of conspirators. 



 Hal slept but little that night. Amid the 
sounds of the snoring of eight of Reminitsky's other board- 
ers, he lay going over in his mind various things which 
might happen on the morrow. Some of them were far 
from pleasant things; he tried to picture himself with a 
broken nose, or with tar and feathers on him. He re- 
called his theory as to the handling of burglars. The 
" G. F. C." was a burglar of gigantic and terrible propor- 
tions ; surely this was a time to call out, " Help yourself ! " 
But instead of doing it, Hal thought about Edstrom's 
ants, and wondered at the power which made them stay 
in line. 

When morning came, he went up into the mountains, 
where a man may wander and renew his moral force. 
When the sun had descended behind the mountain-tops, 
he descended also, and met Edstrom and Sikoria in front 
of the company office. 

They nodded a greeting, and Edstrom told Hal that 
his wife had died during the day. There being no under- 
taker in North Valley, he had arranged for a woman 
friend to take the body down to Pedro, so that he might 
be free for the interview with Cartwright. Hal put his 
hand on the old man's shoulder, but attempted no word of 
condolence; he saw that Edstrom had faced the trouble 
and was ready for duty. 

" Come ahead," said the old man, and the three went
