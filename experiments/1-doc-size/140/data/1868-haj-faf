"If it is convenient to you, I should like to leave at once," said the
book-keeper, livid with passion.

"As you please," said his employer. "Your salary shall be paid up to the
end of the month."

To this Gilbert offered no opposition. The balance of his salary was
paid him, and he left the warehouse in a very unpleasant frame of mind,
much to the gratification of Micky Maguire, who felt that his vengeance
was complete.

"Now, Michael," said Mr. Rockwell, "I must see what I can do for you. Do
you wish to give up your present business?"

"Yes," said Micky, "I don't like it."

"I can give you a situation as errand-boy in my own employ," said Mr.
Rockwell. "My head clerk will explain your duties."

"What wages will I get?" asked Micky, anxiously.

"For the present you shall have a dollar a day, or six dollars a week. I
will besides give you a new suit of clothes. Will that suit you?"

"Yes," said Micky, feeling as if he had unexpectedly become heir to a
fortune. "When will I begin?"

"To-morrow if you like. Come here this afternoon at three, and I will
send Richard with you to a clothing-house."

Just then Dick, who had been to the post-office, entered, and Mr.
Rockwell in a few words informed him of the changes that had taken
place.

"I believe you and Michael haven't been very good friends," he added;
"but I trust you will get over that."

Dick promptly offered his hand to his old enemy.

"I am glad you are coming here, Micky," he said "I'll do all I can to
help you on, and if we are not good friends it won't be my fault."

"Do you mean that, Dick?" said Micky, almost incredulous.

"Yes, I do."

"I've acted mean by you more'n once."

"If you have, it's all over now," said Dick. "There's no use in
remembering it."

"You're a good fellow, Dick," said Micky, "an' I ought to have known it
before."

Dick was gratified by this testimony from one who for years had been his
active opponent, and he determined to help Micky to turn over the new
leaf which was to bear a very different record from the old one.

When Micky had gone out, Mr. Rockwell said, "Well, Richard, I have lost
my book-keeper."

"Yes, sir," said Dick.

"And I can't say I am sorry. I will do Mr. Gilbert the justice to say
that he understood his business; but he was personally disagreeable, and
I never liked him. Now I suppose I must look out for a successor."

"Yes, sir, I suppose so."

"I know a very competent book-keeper, who is intending to go into
business for himself at the expiration of six months. Until that time I
can secure his services. Now, I have a plan in view which I think you
will approve. You shall at once commence the study of book-keeping in a
commercial school in the evening, and during the day I will direct Mr.
Haley to employ you as his assistant. I think in that way you will be
able to succeed him at the end of his term."

Dick was completely taken by surprise. The thought that he, so recently
plying the trade of a boot-black in the public streets, could rise in
six months to the responsible post of a book-keeper in a large wholesale
house, seemed almost incredible.

"I should like nothing better," he said, his eyes sparkling with
delight, "if you really think I could discharge the duties
satisfactorily."

"I think you could. I believe you have the ability, and of your fidelity
I feel assured."

"Thank you, sir; you are very kind to me," said Dick, gratefully.

"I have reason to be," said Mr. Rockwell, taking his hand. "Under God it
is to your courage that I owe the life of my dear boy. I shall never
forget it. One thing more. I intend Michael to undertake most of your
present duties, such as going to the post-office, etc. Do you think he
will answer?"

"I think so," said Dick. "He has been a rough customer, but then he has
never had a chance. I believe in giving everybody a chance."

"So do I," said Mr. Rockwell. "Michael shall have his chance. Let us
hope he will improve it."

There are many boys, and men too, who, like Micky Maguire, have never
had a fair chance in life. Let us remember that, when we judge them, and
not be too hasty to condemn. Let us consider also whether it is not in
our power to give some one the chance that may redeem him.

That afternoon Micky Maguire was provided with a new suit of clothes, of
which he felt very proud. The next morning, on his way to the
post-office, he fell in with his old confederate, Limpy Jim, who
regarded him with a glance of the most bewildering surprise.

"It aint you, Micky,--is it?" he asked, cautiously, surveying his old
comrade's neat appearance. "When did you come back from the Island?"

"Shut up about the Island, Jim," said Micky. "Do I look as if I had been
there?"

"You look nobby," said Jim. "Where's your brush?"

"I've give up the blackin' business," said Micky.

"You have? What are you going to do? Sell papers?"

"No," said Micky, consequentially. "I'm in business on Pearl Street."

"Why," said Limpy Jim, surprised, "that's where that upstart Ragged Dick
works."

"He aint an upstart, an' he aint ragged," said Micky. "He's a friend of
mine, an' if you insult him, I'll lam' ye."

"O my eyes!" ejaculated Jim, opening the organs of vision to a very wide
extent; "that's the biggest joke I ever heerd of."

"You'll hear of a bigger one pretty quick," said Micky, rolling up his
sleeves, and squaring off scientifically.
