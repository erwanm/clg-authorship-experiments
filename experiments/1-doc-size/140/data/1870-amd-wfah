To Victor the whole thing had the suggestion of an adven 
ture. As well watch peasants dance as to be sleeping in the 
wood. 

" Come. A crumb is as good as a feast sometimes, pro 
vided it have the right flavor. You shall be back to-morrow 
night there is my hand upon it." 

He reached out a small, girlish hand, but sun-burned to a 
point beyond his olive skin. 

"I will go with you." 



 

" Good. My boat lies down at the river's edge. It is past 
noon I believe, and the last of my luncheon was left farther up 
the hill for the squirrels. Enough was the feast, and to-night 
provides for itself." 

"I have lunched," was the brief reply. 

"Shall we find our way down the mountain, then? We can 
drowse and dream in the boat. " 

' ' As you like. " 

Latour rose with graceful agility. Yet Victor smiled oddly, 
it seemed as if he might have perched the other on his 
shoulder and scarcely felt the weight. i * 

"You are not a stranger here?" with a ifoft questioning 
glance. ' 

"No;" blushing, "I live in the town beyond I almost 
think you can see its black smoke going up to heaven as an 
abomination." 

"You do not like the life down there?" in a peculiar tone. 

" Like it ! Does a man choose slavery of his own free will?" 
grinding his heel into the soft mosses, and crushing out 
swarms of insect life. 

"There have been such anomalies, my friend. A regular 
life mapped out by hours : so much work, so much sleep, so 
much eating of fine bread and the fat of lambs, so much purple 
and linen, and one travels by easy stages to the grave. The 
white marble over you vouches for your respectability." 

A light, ironical smile hovered about the lips, playing 
through the fine beard like some far ray of summer lightning. 

" The purple may make one more content. But when it is 
serge and a crust " 

He paused with an abrupt, impatient gesture. 

"That means not a stiver to lose a toss-up either way. 
Then I should take the freedom," glancing at him with keen 
eyes. " Why so brief a holiday ?" 

"With me it is another man's honor, another man's word ;" 
giving a short, uncadcnced laugh, that had in it the roused, 



 

almost tigerish mood. "I go back because I must. Some 
chains never clank, you know, but they do worse." 

"And you pay in groans for superior civilization ! See what 
it is to have been -born a vagabond !" 

With that he touched the violin again, and carolled a brief 
snatch of Goethe's mill-song. 

' ' Let us sing with the birds, my friend, before the next storm 
drenches us, and drives us to silence. And now, I bethink my 
self, that it is time to move on. Down this path, I believe. 
You know the way ?" 

"I have rambled over it a few times," with boyish hesitancy. 

Latour vaulted over rocks, fallen trees, and matted under 
growth, as if he had been a practised gymnast. Victor was 
not far behind. But Latour broke into a wild gipsy chorus, 
while the other kept the silence of wonder. Something in the 
man won upon him curiously. Perhaps a touch of the free 
life as well. 

They reached the shore ere long. The river widening in 
and out among the tall hills, its cool green taking tint from the 
overhanging foliage. In a sheltered nook lay a tiny bark 
moored to a broken stump. 

"Embark, my friend. I cannot promise you Grecian isles, 
or groves of Admetus, but the place is not deficient in beauty. 
It needs only the old gods ; but when Pan died, they vanished. 
Are the idols of gold and silver so much better, that men drain 
out their life-blood for them ?" 

Victor flushed swarthily in shame, and a consciousness of 
ignorance. Ah, if he could leave that old life behind ! 

They both stepped in. Latour took the oars. 

" No, let me, if I shall not distress you by my awkwardness. 
I like it." 

Latour seated himself in the stern, and laid his violin across 
his lap as if it had been a tender human nursling. For an 
instant, he almost envied the tawny Titan facing him, whose 
bright locks shook off glinting lights on the purple river air. 



 

Not a coarse fibre in that brain, no craven blood in those full, 
throbbing veins. 

" And such souls are coined into gold for grasping masters !'' 
he mused. " Do they never dare break the chains forged by 
custom ?" 

The breeze died away the river valley was profoundly still. 
On the one side, a series of hills rising one above the other ; 
here gray and craggy with a faded growth of rock-moss, 
browned by the sun ; there, in soft quivering lights, the wooden 
clumps creeping closer and stretching out long green arms. 
Far nooks in black shadow, a dead tree rising high and grim, 
rent and blackened by some fearful storm, jutting boldly out, 
flaunting the old tale of the nearness of death in the face of the 
few passers-by. The oar plashing into the resisting waters, 
making circles of foam and bringing into life thousands of 
fantastic echoes farther up the stream, as if wood-nymphs were
