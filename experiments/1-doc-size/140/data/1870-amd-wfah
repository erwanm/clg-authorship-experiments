"No, I'll never ask aught of them, or of any master. I 
hate the whole thing ! Every shop may sink to " perdi 
tion he was about to say, but the thought of his father's calling 
restrained him, and so he added "for all I care." 

"You'll be wanting daily bread as well as the rest of us," 
with a half smile of contempt at the boy's foolish energy. 

" I'll get it some other way." 

"If it is black work it makes white money. And no one 
can say that Norcross is a hard master. " 

" I've no fault to find with him. The work is good enough 
for those who like it. I don't." 

With that he turned away, combing out his long light hair 
until it glittered like a sunset sea. 

Baxter thought him an odd compound of vanity and Miss 
Nancyism, his figure of speech for anything foolishly nice. 
t Then he came back a step. 

" Hurst," he said kindly, "you've some odd idees stored in 
your brain. May be it comes of being a parson's son ; but 
your father hasn't a bit of such pride. He's a good man is 
John Hurst. I shall never forget the night he stood over my 
Jem, never. And that he's up in heaven I haven't a doubt 
along of your father's good words. I'm not a religious man, 
Obut I know the genooine article when I see it. I should be 
sorry to have his son go to the bad as parson's sons often do." 

Q 



 

Victor Hurst uttered not on word in reply. His face 
changed from scarlet to white, and a blue line settled about his 
lips. Not altogether anger, either. There was somewhere in 
the words a deep thrust that he could not analyze, and it hurt 
him. 

But Baxter, having given his advice, walked away. Victor 
finished his rude toilet, gave his trousers a brush, put on his 
coat, and went out also, taking up his little basket as he passed 
a shelf. 

The walk was long enough to allow his temper to cool. He 
was hot and hasty, but always it seemed there lay in the depths 
of his heart a soreness that some words rasped into an open 
wound. Why was he so sensitive, so keenly susceptible to 
every look or tone ? 

The streets of Weareham were not marvels of beauty. No 
purely manufacturing town ever can be. The river would have 
given the finest locations ; for on the opposite side the bank was 
very irregular here sloping down into what might have been 
verdurous lawns, there rising into small bluffs which a house 
would have rendered picturesque in the extreme. But instead 
there were shops, with their tall chimneys ; sheds for coal, lime, 
and timber of all kinds ; sloops and schooners flapping their sails 
listlessly in the late afternoon breeze, and two brisk-looking 
steamboats, with a black tug sandwiched between. A busy, 
thriving place, a town in which fortunes were made, where 
the few prospered and the many lived and died unknown 
perhaps not the less happy. God, keeping watch over it all, 
decides. 

It was a long walk out to the little cottage. John Hurst had 
gone thither for cheapness, and to be nearer his work. Not 
but what he could have found enough in the town ; but people 
in this busy place had to swarm everywhere, and a true minis 
ter of God is never at a loss. The men who sent him knew 
that he was doing a good work, and further than that they gave 
themselves little trouble. 



 

But Victor used to wish the cottage elsewhere. The longest 
way round was pleasanter ; but to-night, with his eyes fixed on, 
the eternal hills, he cared little for the minor wayside beauties. 
The branching elms drooping in the summer heat, the glossy 
green maples, the dense horse-chestnuts, scarcely won a glance. 
Now and then he half stumbled over some group of playing 
children ; but not being in a patient mood, he scarcely noted 
the exclamations. 

Through the dusty streets, still smoky and hazy, looking 
dimmer in the orange-red glow of the sunset, the dingy houses 
brightened a bit here and there by some stray gleam. 

Presently they grew more irregular, with larger gardens and 
a few attempts at flowers. He knew of one window where he 
would see a pot of carnations in bloom. A hump-backed 
woman with large sad eyes sat here and sewed. He saw her 
early in the morning and late at night. Was life wearisome to 
her ? Did she never wish to be out of it all ? He thought he 
should, if by any mischance he lost youth and health. 

There she was ! A sweet, placid face, with her silvery hair 
gathered beneath a Quaker cap. Was there something in this 
religion that kept people always at peace? 

On a little farther. Here the ground was quite open, with 
a background of straggling trees, great pines, and chestnuts 
with bare, scraggy trunks and thick masses of foliage above, 
that shut out the view of the mountains beyond. He held 
a grudge against them for that. One had been scathed by 
lightning. A jagged fissure going nearly into the heart, 
twisting the bark away, charring and blackening, and it was 
now a mass of dead branches, save one green twig high atop. 

The cottage had once been a soft light-brown in color, but 
it was sadly faded by time and lack of care. The little garden 
in front was a mass of bloom, and over the porch was trained 
honeysuckle and clematis Virgin's bower. Both displayed 
some scattering flowers, sprays of snowy white, like stars among 
the green, and the yellow and scarlet of the other. The win- 






 

dow-curtains were like drifts of snow, and on each wide ledge 
stood a saucer containing a mound of flowers. 

The woman within heard the stride, and with her work still 
in hand went down the path to meet her son. She knew by 
the step that something had fretted and discomposed him. 
The cloudy face and firmly-set lips were a tacit confession the 
moment he glanced into her eyes. He almost wished that 
she could not fathom his moods quite so readily.
