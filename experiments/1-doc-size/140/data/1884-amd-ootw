be as little restless and unhappy friction as possible. 
Daisy had a full, clear soprano voice, with considerable 
compass. Already she was in request for childish enter- 
tainments. Instrumental music she acquired rapidly. 
The cost of a musical education would be quite a drain, 
yet it would be wiser to spend it on her chiLdren now 
than to give them some future elegance. They could not 
aspire to her old position, but they might command a 
vantage ground of their own. Daisy would make no 
kind of a business woman ; Celia would do much better, 
and yet she felt confident that the fair girl would reach 
the place to which she aspired. Daisy would go gladly 
with some one's help. . 

The breach between her and her relatives had not been 
healed. Mrs. Vanduyne passed her loftily. Mrs. Mar- 
shall's fragile face glanced out of the Vanduyne carriage 
with a curious, longing denial. When they spoke of poor 





Tom, it was to be inferred that all his misfortunes were 
traceable to his wife. How much this angered Mrs. 
Wilder and Mrs. Mountjoy, no one ever knew. If they 
sometimes spoke warmly, it was for the sake of the family 
standing, not because they desired to defend her. They, 
too, treated her with silent disdain, and would have gone 
half over the world for an article rather than apply to her. 
But she had many excellent customers among the elite 
of Westwater. To be sure, she was to them simply a 
milliner with exquisite taste. But she made many warm 
friends. They ail had to seek her out, to visit her. 
With a few exceptions she returned no calls, but she 
made those who came so charmingly welcome that they 
longed to come again. 

This year was destined to make some changes. The 
Archers were to go to Roselle, as the suburb was called, 
now fast becoming quite a pretentious place. Mr. Ar- 
cher's business had increased in a most encouraging man- 
ner. He was henceforth to keep a man employed, while 
Mrs. Archer took upon herself household duties, since her 
mother-in-law was quite broken in health. This left the 
two rooms vacant, and Mrs. Marshall felt that now she 
could afford a real home. 

She gathered her two hundred dollars together shortly 
after the advent of the new year, and journeyed to Mr. 
Howarth's office, hardly able to resist the motherly temp- 
tation of taking her darling Celia. But she had kept this 
matter a strict secret, further than that Celia knew she 
had the money of an old friend who had known both 
parents in their earlier years. It was better, she thought, 
if any question should arise in after time, that they 
should remain in ignorance of any name. With a proud 
and happy heart she started. She could draw a long, free 
breath, and indulge in sundry home comforts so long rigor- 
ously denied. 

Mr, Howarth's foreign trip, though it was all on Eng- 



 

lish sea coasts, had improved him greatly. A noble 
physique always impresses one the more favorably. A Sir 
Galahad must not be wanting in size and strength, and 
yet how many generous and ample bodies hold an infin- 
itesimal soul ! 

" I hardly know whether to welcome you or not," he 
said with his cordial smile, as he took her hand. " Your 
joy at a sense of release from obligation reminds me that 
I no longer have it in my power to befriend you in any 
manner that you will accept." 

" You are mistaken in one side of your argument," and 
the light frost of reserve left her face illumined with a 
lovely expression of gratitude. "If I should come to 
misfortune again there is no one to whom I could apply 
with such perfect frankness and ease ; nay, more," and his 
soul thanked her for the words, " there is no one to whom 
I could apply at all. You are the one friend to whom 
I should come, sure of being unquestioned or of being 
doubted, and confident of the truest faith. I want you 
to know that you have saved me and mine from the ex- 
actions of bitter, grinding poverty, of shame and disgrace. 
I cannot place my children back in the social scale where 
my youth was passed, but it may perhaps please you to 
know that in the next lower round they may attain to 
something above what their mother's necessities aspired 
to. My eldest girl has evinced much genius in an artistic 
line, my second has the soul of music and an unusually 
promising voice. I have no object in life but to advance 
them. And my boy — " 

" Perhaps I can assist you again, here," he exclaimed 
quickly. 

" It will be years first," — she smiled with the sweet 
graciousness of acceptance. " He is but nine, and there 
are years of study and training before him. But if I 
might bring him to you when he needs the older, wiser, 
more manly guidance — " 





" It is a promise," he rejoined. " I will do for him in 
this matter as I would for a son of my own. Mrs. Mar- 
shall, — is it not possible ? — I should be glad to have 
you know Mrs. Howarth," hurriedly. " You would find 
a friend in her, I am sure. Our house is open to " — " you 
and yours," he was about to say, but she stopped him with 
an entreating gesture of her hand. 

" No, no," she cried, her secret soul wrung with a pang. 
" Men do not, cannot understand. There are a hundred 
little differences, pin-pricks up to swift, cruel, rapier 
thrusts. Let me keep in my own place ; let me remem- 
ber your kindness with no regrets. It stands out so clear 
and comforting that I cannot mar it by any inadver- 
tence." 

How could he let this lovely woman go out of his life, 
— the life in which she should have been enfolded and 
kept from harm ; the life that he should have made one 
long summer day ; the children he would have loved and 
caressed, and been proud of with a father's noble pride ; 
the wife he could have loved in all integrity and honor. 
He saw it like some radiant vision ; he knew now all that 
would be forever lost out of both lives. 

" I cannot mar it by any inadvertence ! " The words 
rang through his brain like the last strains of music to 
Sir Galahad. Oh, noble, knightly soul shrined in woman's
