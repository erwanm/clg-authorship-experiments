which overlooked the water, whose white expanse 
glittered between the trees. The place was de- 
lightfully cool, and had the added charm that in 



   

the softly sounding pine boughs you seemed to 
hear the coolness as well as feel it. Felix and 
Gertrude sat down on the rust-colored carpet of 
pine-needles and talked of many things. Felix 
spoke at last, in the course of talk, of his going 
away; it was the first time he had alluded to it. 

" You are going away ? " said Gertrude, looking 
at him. 

" Some day when the leaves begin to fall. 
You know I can't stay forever." 

Gertrude transferred her eyes to the outer pros- 
pect, and then, after a pause, she said, " I shall 
never see you again." 

" Why not ? " asked Felix. " We shall proba- 
bly both survive my departure." 

But Gertrude only repeated, " I shall never see 
you again. I shall never hear of you," she went 
on. " I shall know nothing about you. I knew 
nothing about you before, and it will be the same 
again." 

" I knew nothing about you then, unfortu- 
nately," said Felix. " But now I shall write to 
you." 

" Don't write to me. I shall not answer you," 
Gertrude declared. 

"I should of course burn your letters," said 
Felix. 

Gertrude looked at him again. " Burn my let- 
ters ? You sometimes say strange things." 



 

" They are not strange in themselves," the young 
man answered. " They are only strange as said 
to you. You will come to Europe." 

" With whom shall I come ? " She asked this 
question simply ; she was very much in earnest. 
Felix was interested in her earnestness ; for some 
moments he hesitated. " You can't tell me that," 
she pursued. "You can't say that I shall go 
with my father and my sister; you don't believe 
that." 

"I shall keep your letters," said Felix, pres- 
ently, for all answer. 

" I never write. I don't know how to write." 
Gertrude, for some time, said nothing more ; and 
her companion, as he looked at her, wished it had 
not been "disloyal " to make love to the daughter 
of an old gentleman who had offered one hospital- 
ity. The afternoon waned ; the shadows stretched 
themselves ; and the light grew deeper in the 
western sky. Two persons appeared on the op- 
posite side of the lake, coming from the house and 
crossing the meadow. " It is Charlotte and Mr. 
Brand," said Gertrude. " They are coming over 
here." But Charlotte and Mr. Brand only came 
down to the edge of the water, and stood there, 
looking across ; they made no motion to enter the 
boat that Felix had left at the mooring-place. Fe- 
lix waved his hat to them ; it was too far to call. 



   

They made no visible response, and they pres- 
ently turned away and walked along the shore. 

" Mr. Brand is not demonstrative," said Felix. 
" He is never demonstrative to me. He sits silent, 
with his chin in his hand, looking at me. Some- 
times he looks away. Your father tells me he is 
so eloquent ; and I should like to hear him talk. 
He looks like such a noble young man. But with 
me he will never talk. And yet I am so fond of 
listening to brilliant imagery ! " 

" He is very eloquent," said Gertrude ; " but he 
has no brilliant imagery. I have heard him talk 
a great deal. I knew that when they saw us they 
would not come over here." 

" Ah, he is making la cour, as they say, to your 
sister ? They desire to be alone ? " 

" No," said Gertrude, gravely, " they have no 
such reason as that for being alone." 

"But why does n't he make la cour to Char- 
lotte ? " Felix inquired. u She is so pretty, so 
gentle, so good." 

Gertrude glanced at him, and then she looked 
at the distantly-seen couple they were discussing. 
Mr. Brand and Charlotte were walking side by 
side. They might have been a pair of lovers, and 
yet they might not. " They think I should not 
be here," said Gertrude. 

" With me ? J thought you did n't have those 
ideas." 



 

" You don't understand. There are a great 
many things you don't understand." 

" I understand my stupidity. But why, then, 
do not Charlotte and Mr. Brand, who, as an elder 
sister and a clergyman, are free to walk about to- 
gether, come over and make me wiser by breaking 
up the unlawful interview into which I have lured 
you ? " 

" That is the last thing they would do," said 
Gertrude.
