 

" That depends. It depends upon your idea of 
fun. Your friends probably were not introduced." 

" Introduced ? " Clifford demanded. 

" They had no opportunity of going into socie- 
ty; they formed no relations" This was one of a 
certain number of words that the Baroness often 
pronounced in the French manner. 

" They went to a ball, in Paris ; I know that," 
said Clifford. 

" Ah, there are balls and balls ; especially in 
Paris. No, you must go, you know ; it is not a 
thing from which you can dispense yourself. You 
need it." 

" Oh, I 'm very well," said Clifford. " I 'm not 
sick." 

" I don't mean for your health, my poor child. 
I mean for your manners." 

" I have n't got any manners ! " growled Clifford. 

" Precisely. You don't mind my assenting to 
that, eh ? " asked the Baroness with a smile. " You 
must go to Europe and get a few. You can get 
them better there. It is a pity you might not 
have come while I was living in in Germany. 
I would have introduced you; I had a charming 
little circle. You would perhaps have been rather 
young ; but the younger one begins, I think, the 
better. Now, at any rate, you have no time to 
lose, and when I return you must immediately 
come to me." 



   

All this, to Clifford's apprehension, was a great 
mixture his beginning young, Eugenia's return 
to Europe, his being introduced to her charming 
little circle. What was he to begin, and what was 
her little circle ? His ideas about her marriage had 
a good deal of vagueness ; but they were in so far 
definite as that he felt it to be a matter not to be 
freely mentioned. He sat and looked all round 
the room ; he supposed she was alluding in some 
way to her marriage. 

" Oh, I don't want to go to Germany," he said ; 
it seemed to him the most convenient thing to say. 

She looked at him a while, smiling with her 
lips, but not with her eyes. 

" You have scruples ? " she asked. 

" Scruples ? " said Clifford. 

" You young people, here, are very singular ; 
one doesn't know where to expect you. When 
you are not extremely improper you are so terri- 
bly proper. I dare say you think that, owing to 
my irregular marriage, I live with loose people. 
You were never more mistaken. I have been all 
the more particular." 

" Oh, no," said Clifford, honestly distressed. 
" I never thought such a thing as that." 

" Are you very sure? I am convinced that 
your father does, and your sisters. They say to 
each other that here I am on my good behavior, 



 

but that over there married by the left hand 
I associate with light women." 

" Oh, no," cried Clifford, energetically, " they 
don't say such things as that to each other ! " 

" If they think them they had better say them," 
the Baroness rejoined. " Then they can be con- 
tradicted. Please contradict that whenever you 
hear it, and don't be afraid of coming to see me 
on account of the company I keep. I have the 
honor of knowing more distinguished men, my 
poor child, than you are likely to see in a life-time. 
I see very few women ; but those are women of 
rank. So, my dear young Puritan, you needn't 
be afraid. I am not in the least one of those who 
think that the society of women who have lost 
their place in the vrai monde is necessary to form 
a young man. I have never taken that tone. I 
have kept my place myself, and I think we are a 
much better school than the others. Trust me, 
Clifford, and I will prove that to you," the Bar- 
oness continued, while she made the agreeable re- 
flection that she could not, at least, be accused of 
perverting her young kinsman. " So if you ever 
fall among thieves don't go about saying I sent 
you to them." 

Clifford thought it so comical that he should 
know in spite of her figurative language 
what she meant, and that she should mean what 

  

he knew, that he could hardly help laughing a 
little, although he tried hard. *' Oh, no ! oh, no ! " 
he murmured. 

" Laugh out, laugh out, if I amuse you ! " cried 
the Baroness. " I am here for that ! " And 
Clifford thought her a very amusing person in- 
deed. " But remember," she said on this occasion, 
" that you are coming next year to pay me 
a visit over there." 

About a week afterwards she said to him, point- 
blank, " Are you seriously making love to your 
little cousin ? " 

" Seriously making love " these words, on 
Madame Miinster's lips, had to Clifford's sense a 
portentous and embarrassing sound; he hesitated 
about assenting, lest he should commit himself to 
more than he understood. " Well, I should n't 
say it if I was ! " he exclaimed.
