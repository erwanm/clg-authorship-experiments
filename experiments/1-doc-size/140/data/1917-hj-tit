"He's seeing him now — alone. For five minutes. Not all at once." But Miss Mumby was 
visibly serene. 

This made Miss Gaw rejoice. "I'm not afraid. 
It will do him good. It has got to!" she finely 
declared. 

Miss Mumby was so much at ease that she 
could even sanction the joke. "More good than 
the strain of waiting. They're quite satisfied." 
Rosanna knew these judges for Doctor Root and 
Doctor Hatch, and felt the support of her friend's 
firm freshness. "So we can hope," this authority concluded. 

"Well, let my daughter run it — !" Abel Gaw 
had got up as if this change in the situation quali- 





 

fied certain proprieties, but turned his small 
sharpness to Miss Mumby, who had at first 
produced in him no change of posture. "Well, 
if he couldn't stand me I suppose it was because 
he knows me — and doesn't know this other man. 
May Mr. Fielder prove acceptable!" he added, 
stepping off the verandah to the path. But as that left Rosanna's share in the interest still apparently unlimited he spoke again. "Is it going 
to make you settle over here ? " 

This mild irony determined her at once joining 
him, and they took leave together of their friend. 
"Oh I feel it's right now!" She smiled back at 
Miss Mumby, whose agitation of a confirmatory 
hand before disappearing as she had come testified to the excellence of the understanding between the ladies, and presently was trailing her 
light vague draperies over the grass beside her 
father. They might have been taken to resemble 
as they moved together a big ship staying its 
course to allow its belittled tender to keep near, 
and the likeness grew when after a minute Mr. 
Gaw himself stopped to address his daughter a 
question. He had, it was again marked, so scant 
a range of intrinsic tone that he had to resort 
for emphasis or point to some other scheme of 
signs — this surely also of no great richness, but 
expressive of his possibilities when once you 
knew him. "Is there any reason for your not 
telling me why you're so worked up ?" 





 

His companion, as she paused for accommodation, showed him a large flat grave face in which 
the general intention of deference seemed some- 
how to confess that it was often at the mercy — 
and perhaps most in this particular relation — of 
such an inward habit of the far excursion as could 
but incorrigibly qualify for Rosanna Gaw certain 
of the forms of attention, certain of the necessi- 
ties of manner. She was, sketchily speaking, so 
much higher-piled a person than her father that 
the filial attitude in her suffered at the best from 
the occasional air of her having to come down 
to him. You would have guessed that she was 
not a person to cultivate that air; and perhaps 
even if very acute would have guessed some other 
things bearing on the matter from the little man's 
careful way with her. This pair exhibited there 
in the great light of the summer Sunday morning more than one of the essential, or perhaps 
the rather finally constituted, conditions of their 
intercourse. Here was a parent who clearly appealed to nobody in the world but his child, and 
a child who condescended to nobody in the world 
but her parent; and this with the anomaly of a 
constant care not to be too humble on one side 
and an equal one not to be too proud on the 
other. Rosanna, her powerful exposed arm raised 
to her broad shoulder, slowly made her heavy 
parasol revolve, flinging with it a wide shadow 
that enclosed them together, for their question 





 

and answer, as in a great bestreamered tent. "Do 
I strike you as worked up ? Why I've tried to keep 
as quiet about it as I possibly could — as one does 
when one wants a thing so tremendously much." 

His eyes had been raised to her own, but after 
she had said this in her perfunctory way they 
sank as from a sense of shyness and might have 
rested for a little on one of their tent-pegs. "Well, 
daughter, that's just what I want to understand 
— your personal motive." 

She gave a sigh for this, a strange uninforming 
sigh. "Ah father, 'my personal motives' !" 

With this she might have walked on, but when 
he barred the way it was as if she could have 
done so but by stepping on him. "I don't complain of your personal motives — I want you to 
have all you're entitled to and should like to 
know who's entitled to more. But couldn't you 
have a reason once in a while for letting me know 
what some of your reasons are ?" 

Her decent blandness dropped on him again, 
and she had clearly this time come further to 
meet him. "You've always wanted me to have 
things I don't care for — though really when you've 
made a great point of it I've often tried. But 
want me now to have this." And then as he 
watched her again to learn what "this," with the 
visibly rare importance she attached to it, might 
be: "To make up to a person for a wrong I once 
did him." 





 

"You wronged the man who has come?" 

"Oh dreadfully!" Rosanna said with great 
sweetness. 

He evidently held that any notice taken of 
anyone, to whatever effect, by this great 
daughter of his was nothing less than an honour 
done, and probably overdone; so what preposterous "wrong" could count? The worst he
