Samuel's jaw fell. "I never thought of 
that," he said. 

" Go on," said Charlie. 

Then Samuel told how he was starving, and 
how he had gone to Professor Stewart, and how 
the professor had told him he was one of the un- 
fit. His companion had taken his pipe out of his 
mouth and was staring at him. 

" And you swallowed all that? " he gasped. 

"yes," said Samuel. 

"And you tried to carry it out! You went 
away to starve! " 

" But what else was there for me to do? " asked 
the boy. 

" By the Lord! " ejaculated the other. " When 
it came time for me to starve, I can promise you 
I f otmd something else to do ! " 

" Go on," he said after a pause; and Samuel 
told how he had saved young Lockman's life, and 
what happened afterwards. 

" And so he was your dream! " exclaimed the 
other. " You were up against a brace game, 
Sammy! " 

" But how was I to know? " protested the 
boy. 

" You should read the papers. That kid's been 
cutting didoes in the Tenderloin for a couple of 





years. He wasn't worth the risking of your little 
finger — to say nothing of your life." 

" It seems terrible," said Samuel dismayed. 

" The trouble with you, Sammy," commented 
the other, " is that you're too good to live. That's 
all there is to your unfitness. You take old Lock- 
man, for instance. What was all his ' fitness ' ? 
It was just that he was an old wolf. I 
was raised in this town, and my dad went 
to school with him. He began by cheating his 
sisters out of their inheritance. Then he fore- 
closed a mortgage on a glass factory and went 
into the business. He was a skinflint, and he 
made money — they say he burned the plant down 
for the insurance, but I don't know. Anyway, he 
had rivals, and he made a crooked deal with some 
of the railroad people — gave them stock you 
know — and got rebates. And he had some union 
leaders on his pay rolls, and he called strikes on 
his rivals, and when he'd ruined them he bought 
them out for a song. And when he had every- 
thing in his hands, and got tired of paying high 
wages, he fired some of the vmion men and forced 
a strike. Then he brought in some strike-break- 
ers and hired some thugs to slug them, and turned 
the police loose on the men — and that was the end 
of the imions. Meanwhile he'd been running the 
politics of the town, and he'd given himself all 
the franchises — there was nobody could do any- 





thing in Lockmanville unless He said so. And 
finally, when he'd got the glass trade cornered, 
he formed the Trust, and issued stock for about 
five times what the plants had cost, and dumped 
it on the market for suckers like you to buy. And 
that's the way he made his millions — that's the 
meaning of his palace and all the wonders you 
saw up there. And now he's dead, and all his 
fortime belongs to Master Albert, who never did 
a stroke of work in his life, and isn't ' fit ' enough 
to be a ten-dollar-a-week clerk. And you come 
along and lie down for him to walk on, and the 
more nails he has in his boots the better you like 
it I And there's the whole story for you I " 

Samuel had been listening awe-stricken. The 
abysmal depths of his ignorance and folly! 

" Now he's got his money," said the other — 
" and he means to keep it. So there are the bulls, 
to slam you over the head if you bother him. 
That's called the Law! And then he hires some 
duffer to sit up and hand you out a lot of dope 
about your being ' unfit ' ; and that's called a 
College! Don't you see? " 

"Yes," whispered Samuel. "I see!" 

His companion stabbed at him with his finger. 
" All that was wrong with you, Sammy," he said, 
" was that you swallowed the dope ! That's where 
your ' unfitness ' came in! Why — take his own 
argument. Suppose you hadn't given up. Sup- 





pose you'd fought and won out. Then you'd 
have been as good as any of them, wouldn't 
you? Suppose, for iustance, you'd hit that 
son-of-a-gun over the head with a poker and 
got away with his watch and his poeketbook — 
then you'd have been ' fitter ' than he, wouldn't 
you? " 

Samuel had clutched at the arms of his chair 
and was staring with wide-open eyes. 

" You never thought of that, hey, Sammy? 
[But that's what I found myself facing a few 
years ago. They'd got every cent I had, and I 
was ready for the scrap heap. But I said, ' Nay, 
nay, Isabel! ' I'd played their game and lost — 
but I made a new game — and I made my own 
rules, you can bet! " 

" You mean stealing! " cried the boy. 

" I mean War," replied the other. " And you 
see — I've survived! I'm not pretty to look at
