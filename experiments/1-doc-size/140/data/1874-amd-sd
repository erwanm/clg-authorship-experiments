brought his Cloves (o he mended, and used (o

I could see how it would he. One by one 
the birdlingS would II v out of the home nest. 
I was an cvcrv-dav useful body and would be 
needed to help tin.  others, make some ready to 
tro and comfort those who staid. I didn't sun- 


pose the sweet grace and patience that glorified 
Miss Oldwav's face would ever come in mine. 
It was such a round, funnv little face, and would 
get so sun-burned in summer. No one could 
ever call me fair and dainty. 

I laughed over it softly to myself, I was in 
such a merry mood. In ten vcars I should be 

twenty-eight, getting on the "'list' a, wCC hi!, 
visiting round the same as usual, earning broths 
and jellies, listen'mi;' (o sorrows and complaints, 
and by that time, perhaps, a little better, u 




Little nearer tin; (Jrcaf ensample so that J could 

say my say without faltering. 

My basket was emptied at length. I leaned 

over the fence awhile and talked with Mrs. Hay, 

who "could not sec why," ahout something. 

Aunt Letty Perkins came alon;*;, piiriiu^- an<l 
wheezing. Sin: h;ul IXMUI couliiir-d lo I IK- hoiiso 
a good de;il since ( 'liristmas, witli the asthin;i,, 
and if it was not irreverent I should say - 
" Israel had had peace." 

" All well, I suppose;? ' 

" Yes, thank you." 

" I never sec such folks. You don't have a 
hit of sickness or IrouMc like other people! 

" No," said Mrs. I>ay, as if she felt personally 
aggrieved. lt I never saw the rnalch lo that hahy, 
and my poor l;nnh in the church-yard! 

I wanted to reply th;it it was the care and 
watchfulness, the love and tenderness that never 
tired. We did not suffer real hearl -fell, trouble, 
hut there were hard piliehe.; ;ui(| perplexities, 
many things iven up I hat we longed lo have;, 
hours of patient industry, self-denial and all Ilia!. 
I)o discontented people ever realize what stc;e 
courage and grace if takes to make- many li . 
lo-il. I'.iii- and sweet? 



 

"Well, it's out of its trouble," pursued Aunt 
Letty. "You never can tell what children are 
coming to. Goin' to take boarders agen this 
summer ? ' 

That last to me. I started and colored at 
the impertinence. I wanted to resent it, but I 
knew that would not help for an example. 

" Mr. Duncan is at home and can take care 
of his brothers ; ' I replied quietly. 

"Well, they wa'nt much addition to the 
neighborhood. That young one was a master- 
hand at mischief. I should have wanted a good 
deal of money to pay me." 

"Good-night;" I said rather abruptly, "I 



must be going." 

"Why don't you come in? I haven't seen 
your ma in an age. Nobody drops in when 
I am sick, though if I do say it myself, I've 
always been neighborly. No one can say I ever 
went on the other side like the publican." 

" Indeed they could not," I thought to my- 
self with a smile. 

All this made me later than I expected to be. 
As I came up the road I saw Fanny and Mr. 
Duncan walking slowly to meet me. 

Something dreadful flashed into my mind at 




that moment and made mv face scarlet. I remembered 
that in my talk with Louis I had 
spoken of the probabilty of Stephen's marrying 
Fanny. What if he had repeated that bit of 
idle gossip? Stuart would have done so from 
pure love of teasing. 

" Why, Rose, how you have hurried! You are 
as red as your reddest namesake. Do stop and 
cool off a moment, child ! ' 

That from Fanny did not make me any paler. 
I felt the contrast very keenly. She tall and 


elegant, with her graceful self-possession, and I 
such a little budget ! I don't know why I 

should have cared just at that moment, but I 
felt mortified enough to cry. 

Mr. Duncan put out his hand. I just touched 
the tips of his fingers. 

"I am glad to see you." Then he looked 
me all over with those strange eyes of his that 
could be so dark and piercing.
