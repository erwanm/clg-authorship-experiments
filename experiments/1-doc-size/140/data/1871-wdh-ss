wind to-day ; it's merely our nearness to the sea." 

" I think, Franklin," said Aunt Melissa, " that we 
won't go down to the beach this afternoon," as if 
she had been there yesterday, and would go to-mor- 
row. " It 's too late in the day ; and it wouldn't be 
good for the child, I'm sure." 

" Well, aunty, it was you determined us to wait 
for the boat, and it 's your right to say whether we 
shall leave it or not. I'm very willing not to go 
ashore. I always find that, after working up to an 
object with great efibrt, it 's surpassingly sweet to 
leave it unaccompHshed at last. Then it remains 
forever in the region of the ideal, amongst thq songs 
that never were sung, the pictures that never were 
painted. Why, in fact, should we force this pleas- 
ure ? We've eaten our lunch, we've lost the warm 
heart of the day ; why should we poorly drag over 
to that damp and sullen beach, where we should find 



 

three hours very long, when by going back now we 
can keep intact that glorious image of a day by the 
sea which we've been cherishing all summer ? You're 
right, Aunt Melissa ; we won't go ashore ; we will 
stay here, and respect our illusions." 

At heart, perhaps, Lucy did not quite like this 
retreat ; it was not in harmony with the youthful 
spirit of her sex, but she' reflected that she could 
come again, — beneficent cheat of Another Time, 
how much thou sparest us in our over-worked, over- 
enjoyed world ! — she was very comfortable where 
jshe was, in a seat commanding a perfect view for the 
return trip ; and she submitted without a murmur. 
Besides, now that the boat had drawn up to the pier, 
and discharged part of her passengers, and was wait- 
ing to take on others, Lucy was interested in a mass 
of fluttering dresses and wide-rimmed straw hats 
that drew down toward the "Rose Standish," and 
gracefully thronged the pier, and prettily hesitated 
about, and finally came aboard with laughter and 
little false cries of terror, attended through all by the 
New England disproportion of that sex which is so 
foolish when it is silly. It was a large picnic party 
which had been spending the day upon the beach, as 
each of the ladies showed in her face, where, if the 
roses upon her cheeks were somewhat obscured by 
the imbrowning seaside sun, a bright pink had been 
compensatingly bestowed upon the point of her nose. 
A mysterious quiet fell upon them all when they 
were got aboard and had taken conspicuous places, 
which was accounted for presently when a loud shout 



 

was heard from the shore, and a man beside an am- 
bulant photographic machine was seen wildly waving 
his hat. It is impossible to resist a temptation of 
this kind, and our party all yielded, and posed them- 
selves in striking and characteristic attitudes, — even 
Aunt Melissa sharing the ambition to appear in a 
picture which she should never see, and the nurse 
coming out strong from the abeyance in which she 
had been held, and lifting the baby high into the air 
for a good hkeness. The frantic gesticulator on the 
shore gave an impressive wave with both hands, took 
the cap from the instrument, turned his back, as pho- 
tographers always do, with that air of hiding their 
tears, for the brief space that seems so long, and 
then clapped on the cap again, while a great sigh of 
relief went up from the whole boat-load of passen- 
gers. They were taken. 

But the interval had been a luckless one for the 
" Rose Standish," and when she stirred her wheels, 
clouds of mud rose to the top of the water, and 
there was no responsive movement of the boat. She 
was aground in the falling tide. 

" There seems a pretty fair prospect of our spend- 
ing some time here, after all," said Frank, while the 
ladies, who had reluctantly given up the idea of stay- 
ing, were now in a quiver of impatience to be off. 
The picnic was shifted from side to side ; the engine 
groaned and tugged. Captain Miles Standish and his 
crew bestirred themselves vigorously, and at last the 
boat swung loose, and strode down the sea-weedy 
channels ; while our friends, who had already done 



 

the great sights of the harbor, now settled themselves 
to the enjoyment of its minor traits and beauties. 
Here and there they passed small parties on the 
shore, which, with their yachts anchored near, or 
their boats drawn up from the water, were cooking 
an out-door meal by a fire that burned bright red 
upon the sands in the late afternoon air. In such 
cases, people willingly indulge themselves in salut- 
ing whatever craft goes by, and the ladies of these 
small picnics, as they sat round the fires, kept up 
a great waving of handkerchiefs, and sometimes 
cheered the " Rose Standish," though I believe the 
Bostonians are ordinarily not a demonstrative race. 
Of course the large picnic on board fluttered multi- 
tudinous handkerchiefs in response, both to these 
people ashore and to those who hailed them irom 
vessels which they met. They did not refuse the 
politeness even to the passengers on a rival boat 
when she passed them, though at heart they must 
have felt some natural pangs at being passed. The 
water was peopled everywhere by all sorts of sail 
lagging slowly homeward in the light evening breeze ; 
and on some of the larger vessels there were family 
groups to be seen, and a graceful smoke, suggestive 
of supper, curled from the cook's galley. I suppose 
these ships were chiefly coasting craft, of one kind 
or another, come from the Provinces at farthest ; but 
to the ignorance and the fancy of our friends, they 
arrived from all remote and romantic parts of the 
world, — from India, from China, and from the South 
Seas, with cargoes of spices and gums and tropical 



 

fruits ; ajid I see no reason why one should ever 
deny himself the easy pleasure they felt in painting 
the unknown in such hvely hues. The truth is, a 
strange ship, if you will let her, always brings you
