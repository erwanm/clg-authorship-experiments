                         *THE DUCHESS OF NAXOS*


I was still sitting there when somebody knocked, and, supposing it to be
Smith, I said, "come in."

Thusis entered, and I rose.  We looked at each other in silence, then I
set a chair for her by my table and she dropped onto it as though tired.

She wore a dark hat and a dark gown which I had never seen.  Also she
was gloved, another phase hitherto unfamiliar to me.  And her beauty
almost hurt me.

"You are not going with us?" she asked in a low voice.

"No."

"Why not?"

"There is no reason why I should go."

"You are not afraid to remain?"

I forced a smile.

"You choose to stay here in this house all alone with these huns?" she
persisted.

"What else is there to do?  Besides, they’ll leave to-morrow."

"And then you’ll be utterly alone here."

I nodded, smiling.

"Won’t you come with us as far as France?"

I thanked her.

"Why won’t you?"

"I think I’d be rather lonelier in France," I said lightly, "than I
might be here."

"Will you be lonely?"

I did not answer.

"When I glanced across the table at her again she had unpinned her hat.
I waited; but she tossed it from her onto my bed.

"Why do you do that?" I asked.

"I shall not leave unless you do," she said serenely.

"That’s nonsense!  I am in no danger!"

"I should be, if I left you alone here."

"In what danger?"

"In danger—of falling a prey to—grief—Michael."

My heart almost stopped: she was looking down at the gloves which she
was slowly stripping from her wrists:

"Danger of grief," she repeated, "of lifelong sorrow—for leaving
you—here—alone....  Because, once, I gave my heart to you...."

"You were only Thusis, then," I said, steadying my voice and senses with
an effort.

"Am I less, now, in your eyes?"  She lifted her head and looked at me.

"You are the Duchess of Naxos."

She smiled faintly: "What was it you once said to me about
revolutions?—about the necessity for purity of motive and absolute
unselfishness for those who revolted against tyranny?"

I was silent.

"Michael?"

"Yes."

"How can I incite my people to revolt unless my motives are entirely
free from selfish interest?"

"Are they not?"

"Why do you ask me?  You know that I would be Duchess of Naxos if my
country regains its freedom under the Italian crown."

"Has that influenced you?"

Her candid, sweet gaze met mine: "I think it has."

And, as I said nothing, "I hadn’t quite considered it in that light,"
she said.  "I thought my motives were pure.  Besides, I really am
hereditary Duchess of Naxos—if ever there is to be such a Duchy again."
She laughed a little.  "A phantom ruler in a phantom realm.  It must
amuse you, Michael."

"It may all come to pass," said I.

"No."

"Why not?"

"Monsieur Venizelos does not wish it.  Nor does the King of Italy.  Also
I am afraid that Naxos is really quite contented under the Greek flag,
now that Constantino is exiled and because, moreover, that same flag
flies beside the flags of England, France, and Italy....  No, Michael,
there will be no revolution now in Naxos; no Duchy, no Duchess.... And,"
she rose and looked at me, and stretched out one fair hand, "come into
France with me, Michael.... I can’t leave my heart here with you unless
I stay here, too....  I can’t become disembodied and float off to France
leaving heart and mind and body and soul here—in your arms—in the arms
of the man I—love....  Can I, dear Michael?—Can I my dear lover?—my
dearest—my beloved——"


Her fragrant, flushed face was close against mine when we heard Smith’s
trunk banging in his room and Raoul’s voice: "Easy, mon vieux!  Mon
dieu, but it’s heavy, your Norwegian-American luggage."

"Darling!" she exclaimed in consternation, "you’re not packed up!
Quick, Michael!  I’ll help you——"

"Thusis, I don’t want this junk!  Do you know what I am going to take
with me?"

"What, darling?"

"My poems to you; the portrait of the Admiral; and my photograph of The
Laughing Girl.... And nothing else whatever."
