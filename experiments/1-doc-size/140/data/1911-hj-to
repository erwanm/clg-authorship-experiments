else for a sum of money that--smaller or greater--you can find with
perfect ease in that extraordinarily bulging pocket?”

Lord Theign, slowly pacing the hall again, threw up his hands. “Ah, with
‘perfect ease’ can scarcely be said!”

“Why not?--when he absolutely thrusts his dirty dollars down your
throat.”

“Oh, I’m not talking of ease to him,” Lord Theign returned--“I’m
talking of ease to myself. I shall have to make a sacrifice.”

“Why not then--for so great a convenience--gallantly make it?”

“Ah, my dear chap, if you want me to sell my Sir Joshua----!”

But the horror in the words said enough, and Lord John felt its chill.
“I don’t make a point of that--God forbid! But there are other things to
which the objection wouldn’t apply.”

“You see how it applies--in the case of the Moret-to--for him. A mere
Moretto,” said Lord Theign, “is too cheap--for a Yankee ‘on the spend.’”

“Then the Mantovano wouldn’t be.”

“It remains to be proved that it is a Mantovano.”

“Well,” said Lord John, “go into it.”

“Hanged if I won’t!” his friend broke out after a moment. “It would
suit me. I mean”--the explanation came after a brief intensity of
thought--“the possible size of his cheque would.”

“Oh,” said Lord John gaily, “I guess there’s no limit to the possible
size of his cheque!”

“Yes, it would suit me, it would suit me!” the elder man, standing
there, audibly mused. But his air changed and a lighter question came
up to him as he saw his daughter reappear at the door from the terrace.
“Well, the infant horde?” he immediately put to her.

Lady Grace came in, dutifully accounting for them. “They’ve marched
off--in a huge procession.”

“Thank goodness! And our friends?”

“All playing tennis,” she said--“save those who are sitting it out.” To
which she added, as to explain her return: “Mr. Crimble has gone?”

Lord John took upon him to say. “He’s in the library, to which you
addressed him--making discoveries.”

“Not then, I hope,” she smiled, “to our disadvantage!”

“To your very great honour and glory.” Lord John clearly valued the
effect he might produce.

“Your Moretto of Brescia--do you know what it really and spendidly
is?” And then as the girl, in her surprise, but wondered: “A Mantovano,
neither more nor less. Ever so much more swagger.”

“A Mantovano?” Lady Grace echoed. “Why, how tremendously jolly!”

Her father was struck. “Do you know the artist--of whom I had never
heard?”

“Yes, something of the little that is known.” And she rejoiced as her
knowledge came to her. “He’s a tremendous swell, because, great as he
was, there are but seven proved examples----”

“With this of yours,” Lord John broke in, “there are eight.”

“Then why haven’t I known about him?” Lord Theign put it as if so many
other people were guilty for this.

His daughter was the first to plead for the vague body. “Why, I suppose
in order that you should have exactly this pleasure, father.”

“Oh, pleasures not desired are like acquaintances not sought--they
rather bore one!” Lord Theign sighed. With which he moved away from her.

Her eyes followed him an instant--then she smiled at their guest. “Is he
bored at having the higher prize--if you’re sure it is the higher?”

“Mr. Crimble is sure--because if he isn’t,” Lord John added, “he’s a
wretch.”

“Well,” she returned, “as he’s certainly not a wretch it must be true.
And fancy,” she exclaimed further, though as more particularly for
herself, “our having suddenly incurred this immense debt to him!”

“Oh, I shall pay Mr. Crimble!” said her father, who had turned round.

The whole question appeared to have provoked in Lord John a rise of
spirits and a flush of humour. “Don’t you let him stick it on.”

His host, however, bethinking himself, checked him. “Go you to Mr.
Bender straight!”

Lord John saw the point. “Yes--till he leaves. But I shall find you
here, shan’t I?” he asked with all earnestness of Lady Grace.

She had an hesitation, but after a look at her father she assented.
“I’ll wait for you.”

“Then à tantôt!” It made him show for happy as, waving his hand at
her, he proceeded to seek Mr. Bender in presence of the object that most
excited that gentleman’s appetite--to say nothing of the effect involved
on Lord John’s own.

Lord Theign, when he had gone, revolved--it might have been
nervously--about the place a little, but soon broke ground. “He’ll have
told you, I understand, that I’ve promised to speak to you for him. But
I understand also that he has found something to say for himself.”

“Yes, we talked--a while since,” the girl said. “At least he did.”

“Then if you listened I hope you listened with a good grace.”

“Oh, he speaks very well--and I’ve never disliked him.”

It pulled her father up. “Is that all--when I think so much of him?”

She seemed to say that she had, to her own mind, been liberal and gone
far; but she waited a little. “Do you think very, very much?”

“Surely I’ve made my good opinion clear to you!”

Again she had a pause. “Oh yes, I’ve seen you like him and believe in
him--and I’ve found him pleasant and clever.”

“He has never had,” Lord Theign more or less ingeniously explained,
“what I call a real show.” But the character under discussion could
after all be summed up without searching analysis. “I consider
nevertheless that there’s plenty in him.”
