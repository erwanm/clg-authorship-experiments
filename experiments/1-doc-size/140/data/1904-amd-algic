Some hardy explorers had gone out, but we knew 
nothing of the western coast then. 

"And then?" with gentle insistence. 

"The Pacific Coast." 

"The Delectable Mountains and the beautiful land 
where the shepherds are feeding their flocks, and 
where there are vineyards and gardens and flowers of 
every hue and fragrance. It is the Promised Land, 
Norman. Some day you and I will start and travel 
it will take weeks and weeks, and we shall be 
filled with delight at its loveliness. We will start 
quite by ourselves, and keep our secret until we do 
go." 

She looked gravely inspired as her eyes turned 
westward over the wastes of snow. 

Years afterward we were to go to the beautiful 
land and wander among orange groves and vines and 
figs and such flowers as we had not dreamed of then, 
but the name of the country was California. 

I put my arm over her shoulder. How fair she was, 
and her sapphire eyes shone with a kind of unearthly 
light. Now and then there came over me a strange 
sort of fear as if sometime she might vanish away to 
an unknown world and I be left alone. 

"You are cold," I said; "come in doors." 

The great log had burned in twain and now broke 
with a crash, sending up myriad sparks while the red 
coals seemed to pulsate like living things. I stirred 



 

them up, brought the ends together, and the next 
moment we had a magnificent blaze. 

"Oh, let us pop some corn," she cried. She was 
down to earth again. "Yes, it does feel lovely here by 
the fire. I'll go for the corn." 

But I thrust down my arm in the great box and 
brought up two ears, so that I could shell one with the 
other. Mr. Gaynor, with the aid of the blacksmith, 
had made a tolerable popper. I drew out the coals 
and then shelled a handful. She held it and shook it 
from time to time, and we laughed at the snapping 
and bouncing. We took off the lid. It wasn't just the 
kind of corn to turn inside out, like a white rose, but 
some of it was very soft and velvety. I liked the 
really roasted grains the best. She, girl-like, preferred 
the more delicate ones. So we laughed and ate our 
fill until we were thirsty. 

"Oh," she began suddenly, "let us read 'The Lady 
of the Lake.' " 

I did not think I was very fond of verse. It sug 
gested the hymn book that I looked over now and 
then, and that always left an uncomfortable feeling in 
my mind. 

She hunted up the book, and bringing a small stand 
near the fire lighted the candle. We had made the blaze 
of the pine torch standing up in the corner do duty 
until then. 

"I am going to read," she began. "I liked it so much 
one day. But you must sit up very straight and not 
go to sleep. This first part about the Harp of the 
North, I don't care for, so I'll begin here. 





" 'The stag at eve had drunk his fill, 

Where danced the moon on Monan's rill ' " 

Then she suddenly paused, 'This is all in Scotland. 
Do you know where Scotland is ?" 

"It is north of England." 

"We haven't liked England over well. Grand 
mother Marvin used to talk about the War of 1812, for 
grandfather was a sailor and was killed. And there 
was all the Revolution. Do you think we will ever 
fight England again?" 

"If we do we'll lick her again," I said with boyish 
American grit. 

"I shouldn't mind war against the Indians," she 
said slowly. "And I do hope England will stay over 
the other side of the ocean, and Norman," hesitat 
ingly, "did you ever see a real deer?" 

"Why, yes. That's where they get venison steak." 

"Oh, now, I will begin again." 

She read very clearly and with the appreciation that 
gives the listener an insight into the real meaning. I 
could not have gone to sleep. The chase stirred all my 
blood, but I was glad the deer escaped. The lovely 
lake among the mountains, the maiden in her skiff, the 
encounter, the guidance, the enchanted hall, the wel 
come to the unknown knight of Snowdoun, and the 
promise of the song. Why, I remembered lines of it 
and said myself to sleep with them. 

"That is the end of the first canto. Next Sunday 
night you shall read. It sounds like music, doesn't 
it?" closing the old book. 

"Yes," I assented. It still rang in my ears. 



 

There was a shuffling and stamping at the door. 
Mr. Gaynor beat out his old hat on the post. 

"Jerusalem! The old woman's feather bed has 
burst open this time, I guess. Why, you can't see 
your hand before you. I've been in snows before, but 
this is about the worst old tougher I ever encountered. 
Norme " he had taken up the familiar name "thank 
your stars you are this near the warehouse, if, indeed, 
you can get there at all to-morrow morning. But I
