" By Jove ! you don't mean it. I thought he 
was on a 'private tear,' as the Americans say; but 
I don't like this at all. Just clear out, and I'll 
be dressed and over in his rooms in less than half 
an hour." And he sprang out of bed before 
Jones had closed the door. 

He was but a few moments dressing, as he had 
promised, and was at Dartmouth's apartment 
before Jones had time to become impatient, 
nervous as he was. He pulled aside the portiere 
of the salon and looked in. The curtains 
were drawn and the room was dark, but on a 
sofa near the window he saw his friend lying. 
He picked his way over through the studiously 
disordered furniture and touched Dartmouth on 
the shoulder. 

"Hal!" he said, "Hal!" 

Dartmouth opened his eyes and looked up. 
" Is it you, Becky ? " he said, languidly. " Go 
away and let me alone." But his words and 
manner indicated that the attack was at last 
" wearing itself out." 

" I will do nothing of the sort," replied Hol- 
lington. " Get up off that sofa this moment. 


A week ! I am ashamed of you. What would 
the old lady say ? " 

" She would understand," murmured Dart- 
mouth. " She always understood. I wish she 
were here now." 

" I wish she were. She would soon have you 
out of this. Get up. Don't be a fool." 

"I am not a fool. I have got one of the 
worst of the old attacks, and I can't shake it off; 
that is all. Go away, and let me fight it out by 
myself." ^ 

" I will not move from this room, if I stay 
here for six months, until you go with me. So 
make up your mind to it." And he threw him- 
self into an easy-chair, and lighting a cigar, 
proceeded leisurely to smoke it. 

Dartmouth turned uneasily once or twice. 
"You know I can't bear anyone near me," he 
said; " I want to be alone." 

"You have been alone long enough. I will 
do as I have said.'' 

There was silence for a few moments, and 
Dartmouth's restlessness increased. Hollington 
watched him closely, and after a time handed 
him a cigar and offered him a light. Dartmouth 
accepted both mechanically, and for a time the 
two men smoked in silence. When Dartmouth 
finished he rose to his feet. 

" Very well," he said, " have your own way. 
Wait until I dress and I will go out with you." 



 

He went into his dressing-room and returned 
about an hour later, during which time 
Hollington had thrown back the curtains and written a 
couple of letters. Dartmouth was still haggard 
and very pale, but his face had been shaved and 
he looked something like himself once more. 
Hollington rose and threw down his pen at 
once. 

" I will drop in on our way back and finish this 
letter," he said. " You must get out of the 
house as quickly as possible. By Jove ! how 
bad you look ! " He put his hand on his friend's 
shoulder and looked at him a moment. He was 
the average Englishman in most of his details, 
tall, well-built, with a good profile, and a 
ruddy Saxon face. His individual characteristics
were an eternal twinkle in his eye, a 
forehead with remarkably well-developed reflectives, 
and a very square chin and jaw. Just now the 
twinkle was less aggressive and his face had 
softened noticeably. " There is no help for it, 
I suppose, Hal, is there ? " he said. " 

Dartmouth looked back at him with a smile, 
and a good deal of affection in his eyes. " No, 
old fellow," he replied; " I am afraid there is 
not. But they are rarely as bad as this last. 
And â€” thank you for coming." 

They went out together and walked to the 
Cafe Anglais on the Boulevard des Italiens. 
The air was keen and cold, the walk a long one, 
and Dartmouth felt like another man by the time 
he sat down to breakfast. One or two other men 
joined them. Hollington was unusually witty, 
the conversation was general and animated, and 
when Dartmouth left the caf6 the past week 
seemed an ugly dream. In the afternoon he 
met the wife of the American Consul-General, 
Mrs. Raleigh, in the Bois, and learned from her 
that Margaret Talbot had left Paris. This 
left him free to remain; and when Mrs. Raleigh 
reminded him that her doors were open that 
evening, he asked permission at once to present 
himself. Mrs. Raleigh not only had a distinguished 
and interesting salon, but she casually 
remarked that she expected Miss Penrhyn, and 
Dartmouth felt a strong desire to see the girl 
again. 

IV. 

When, a few hours later, Dartmouth entered 
Mrs. Raleigh's salon, he saw Miss Penrhyn 
surrounded by some half-dozen men, and talking 
with the abandon of a pleased child, her eyes 
sparkling, her cheeks flushed. As he went over 
to her the flush faded slightly, but she held out 
her hand and smiled up into his eyes. 

"You have been ill," she murmured, sympathetically. 
"You look so still." 

"Yes," he said, "I have been ill; otherwise I 
should have made an effort to see you before. I
