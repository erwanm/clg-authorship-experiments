to start anew the hopes of his heart. 

In another way he was very attractive to Mabel. He had 
been a visitor in the house when her mother was the presid- 
ing genius ; he remembered the old songs she had sung, the 
flowers she had worn in her hair, and books she used to 
read little trifles that came back with a forceful ten- 
derness to the girl's heart. Besides Richard, no one ever 
talked of her mother. To the younger children, their father 
had so thoroughly supplied her place, they rarely looked 
back with the longing regret common to motherless chil- 
dren ; so the peculiar nearness of the relation had been felt 
more exclusively by Mabel. Philip seemed intuitively to 
understand this, and was never at fault with the shy girl. 

Indeed, he seemed almost to have the gift of ubiquity. 
He romped with Tessy, sailed in Archie's boat, talked, sang, 
went out with Richard, and indulged Lily's never-failing 
inquiries about the countries and curiosities he had met 
with. For one so apparently thoughtless, she evinced a 
strange fondness for descriptions of travel or natural scenery. 
Everything on this point was devoured with avidity. She 
soon became absorbed in Philip's brilliant word-pictures. 
He was terse and vigorous, possessing the rare faculty of 
transporting his hearers to the scenes that moved his elo- 
quence, until they fairly beheld with his vision. And when 
he lingered in the glowing orient, or sailed slowly over 
tropical seas, his very voice sank into summer ease and 
indolence, until Lily laughingly declared if she was not so 
deeply interested she should certainly go to sleep. 

Richard insisted that she resembled the skipper's wife in 
Eothen, " who had an inquiring mind and an irresistible ten- 
dency to impart her own opinions, and looked upon her 
guests as a piece of waste intellect, to be carefully tilled," 
which seemed to amuse Philip exceedingly. 

A week passed rapidly. They had done absolutely 



 

nothing, and unanimously declared that Philip must remain 
longer to be entertained. They would sail up the river, and 
spend a day in the woods ; they would go to Passaic Falls, 
and take rides to Eagle Rock, and all places of interest in 
the surrounding country ; and he consented without requir- 
ing much persuasion. Their dinner in the woods was a 
decided success, and their rides wonderfully enjoyable. 
They had not been so happy since their father's death. 
Richard expanded into new life. , 

Philip entered the parlor one evening where Mabel sat 
amusing herself with some old-time ballads. She glanced 
up in surprise. 

" I thought you had gone with Richard," she said. 

" There was a medical association on hand, I believe ; so 
I concluded to return. Where are the children ? " 

" Tessy, tired out, is asleep ; the others are in Mrs. Charl- 
ton's, playing tableaux. Shall we follow them ? " 

"It is too fine a night to remain in doors. What do you 
say to a moonlight row ? It will be niy last chance, for I 
must go to-morrow." 

" Well," she said ; and running up stairs for her shawl, 
paused a moment to inform the housekeeper. Mr. Gregory 
was waiting for her on the balcony, and they walked slowly 
down the path, drinking in the intense loveliness of the 
night. The moon was at its full. Great golden stars seemed 
melting into blue ether, and white, weird drifts, like phantom 
fleets, floated across the sky. Every tree and shrub seemed 
frosted with liquid silver, and each wave of the river tipped 
with a diamond crest, while the reflexes trembled in pearl 
and azure. The air was fragrant with late roses, honey- 
suckle, and the aromatic odor of the trees. 

Assisting Mabel into the boat, he pushed out so as to 
clear the shallow shore. He liked to linger in these green 
glooms at the river's edge, and watch the slender spires of 
shrubbery, that, waving to the slightest breeze, sent troops 
jf dancing images over the tremulous reaches of water. 





Slow, faint swells of the outgoing tide, rhythmical plashes of 
oars, the voice of a flute, and the far-off echoes of some 
singers, filled all the air with melody. It was as if the drift- 
ing motion carried them to the very verge of fairy-land. 

Did they know whither they were hastening ? that in their 
very midst, bounded neither by shining river or shadowy 
shore, lay a land of bliss more potent than those magic realms 
of eld, and he who treads them is a captive as secure as if 
fay Vivien's chain had wound him three times about ? No ; 
the full pulsation of both hearts was too new to be inter- 
preted. Philip Gregory's thoughts had not deepened into 
desire. In coming back to the Bertrands, he fancied he 
took up the old life, and was content. 

During that brief fortnight, a change had come over 
Mabel. The roses, the summer, and herself, all blossomed 
together. She drank in large draughts of quiet, measureless 
joy ; her intuitions became refined, her whole being perme- 
ated with a glow of emotion at once tender and profound. 
Fearlessly she left behind the golden glory of girlhood's 
untroubled sea, and became a woman. No lingering regret, 
no troublous misgiving concerning the future ! the bless- 
edness of faith that comes to many with their first love ! 
Let us take courage, and thank God that it is so. 

They went far off for a subject of conversation. Some- 
thing about the Nile, clustering palms, fragrant waxen lotus 
blooms, wild Egyptian or Arab melodies that left Shelley's 
sweet song ringing through her brain : 

" The wandering airs, they faint 

On the dark, the silent stream ; 
The champak's odors fall 

Like sweet thoughts in a dream; 
The nightingale's complaint, 

It dies upon her heart ." 

After Philip Gregory turned the boat, an exquisite silence 
fell over them. His heart took in the picture Mabel made, 
to the minutest detail. The willowy form, the stately head,
