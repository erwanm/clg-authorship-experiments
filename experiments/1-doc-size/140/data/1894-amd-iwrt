“Oh, will you? I wisht so I had some.”

“The walk will do you good.” There had come a distraught look in
Virginia’s face. Oh, what if John Travis failed! Even to-morrow might be
too late.

“You’ll let the children go with you,” said Dil. “They’ll like it so;
an’ I’ll keep still ’n’ try to go to sleep.”

The old serenity came back with the smile. She had learned so many
lessons of patience and self-denial in the short life, the grand
patience perfected through love and sacrifice, the earthly type of that
greater love. But the sweet little face almost unnerved Virginia.

The children hailed her with delight, and clung so to her gown that she
could hardly take a step. Perhaps it was their noise that had
unconsciously worn upon Dil’s very slender nerves. Miss Mary read to her
awhile, and in the soft, soothing silence she fell asleep.

Yes, she had come to that sign and seal indelibly stamped on the faces
of the “called.” The dread something no word can fitly describe, and it
was so much more apparent in her sleep.

“Miss Mary,” said an attendant, “can you come down a moment?”

She guessed without a word when she saw a young man standing there with
a basket of wild roses. But he could not believe the dread fiat at
first. She had been “a little ill,” and “wasn’t strong” were the tidings
that had startled him, and she had gone to a home for the “Little
Mothers” to recruit. He had heard some other incidents of her sad story,
and he remembered the children’s pathetic clinging to the wild roses.
Nothing could give her greater pleasure.

He walked reverently up the wide, uncarpeted steps, beside Miss Mary.
Dil was still asleep, or—O Heaven! was she dead? Miss Mary bent over,
touched her cool cheek.

Dil opened her eyes.

“I’ve been asleep. It was so lovely. I’m all rested like—why, I’m most
well.”

“Well enough to see an old friend?”

Oh, the glow in her eyes, the eager, asking expression of every feature.
She gave a soft, exultant cry as John Travis emerged from Miss Mary’s
shadow, and stretched out her hands.

“My dear, dear little Dil!”

All the room was full of the faint, delicious fragrance of wild roses,
kept so moist and sheltered they were hardly conscious of their journey.
And she lay trembling in two strong arms, so instinct with vitality,
that she seemed to take from them a sudden buoyant strength.

“I’ve been waitin’ for you so long,” she exclaimed when she found breath
to speak. There was no reproach in the tone, rather a heavenly
satisfaction that he had come now. Her trust had been crowned with
fruition, that was enough.

“My little girl!” Oh, surely it could not be as bad as they said. The
future that he had planned for, that he had meant to make pleasant and
satisfying, and perhaps beautiful, from the fervent gratitude of a manly
heart. Was she beyond anything he could do for her? Oh, he would not
believe it!

“I was detained so much longer abroad than I expected,” he began. “And
we did not get in until Monday morning. I went to Barker’s Court, and
could not learn where you were. Then I bethought myself of the cop at
the square,” smiling as he designated the man.

“An’ he gev you my letter?”

“He gave me the letter. I hunted up the boys. I saw Patsey and Owen last
night, and they are counting on your getting well. They sent you so much
love. And to-day I went to Chester. Here are your roses.”

He tumbled them out all dewy from the wet papers. Oh, such sweetness!
Dil breathed it in ecstatic delight. She had no words. She looked her
unutterable joy out of her limpid brown eyes, and he had much ado to
keep the tears from his. So pale, so spiritualized, yet so little like
Bess, and—oh, the last hope died as he took in all the signs. For
surely, surely she was on the road to heaven and Bess. No hand of love,
no touch of prosperity, could hold her back.

“’Pears like everything’s come, an’ there ain’t nothin’ left to wish
for,” she said as he laid her down again, and watched the transfigured
face. “For now you c’n tell me ’bout Bess. Mother burned up the book one
day, an’ we never could quite know, only she got crost the river, an’
they was all so glad at the pallis. An’ Bess was so sure you’d come. The
cough was dreadful when we didn’t have some good medicine that helped
her. An’ the lady come one afternoon, ’n’ mammy was home ’n’ she was
norful sassy to her. You see, we hadn’t dast to tell mammy—”

“My poor child!” He was toying with the soft, tumbled hair. He had heard
another side of the story, and of Mrs. Quinn’s insulting impudence.

“An’ then Bess she smelt the wild roses all around one night, an’
thought she was gettin’ better—an’—an’ she jus’ died.”

“Yes; God came for her in the night. He put his arms around her, and
wrapped her in the garment of his great love, and took her through the
pathway of the stars. She did not feel any cold nor pain, and he gave
her a new, glorified body, so she could leave the poor old one behind.”

“But she wouldn’t have leaved me ’thout a word, when she loved me so,
an’ wanted me to go to heaven with her.”

Dil’s lip quivered, and her chest heaved with the effort of keeping back
the tears.

“My dear child, there are many mysteries that one cannot wholly explain.
Don’t you remember telling me the Mission teacher said it was an
allegory, a story that is like our daily lives? We are going heavenward
in every right and tender and loving thing we do. We are the children of
God as well as the children of mortal parents; God gives us the soul,
the part of us that is to live forever. And when he calls this part of
you to the heavenly mansions, he gives it the perfect new body. The old
one is laid away in the ground. When Jesus was here he helped and cured
people as I told you. But he does not come any more. He calls people to
him, and sends his angels for them. So he said, ‘It is very hard for
poor little Bess to wait all winter, to suffer with the cold, the pain
in her maimed body, to be afraid of her mother, to hear the babies cry
when her head aches. She must come to the land of pure delight, and have
her new body. She must be well and joyous and happy, so that she can run
and greet her sister Dil when I send for her.”

Dilsey Quinn was listening with rapt attention. But at the last words
she cried out with tremulous eagerness,—

“Oh, will he send? Will he take me to Bess? You are quite sure?”

Her very breath seemed to hang on the answer.

“He will send. He has a place for you in the many mansions he went to
prepare. And this little step we take from one world to the other is
called the river of death, and you know how Christiana went through it.
Sometimes the Lord Jesus lifts people quite over it.”
