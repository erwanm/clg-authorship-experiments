altogether. I can't believe a plain common-sense man, with 
a passion for accumulation, ever meant to will his money to 
El spendthrift or a spendthrift's heirs. That any one could 
demean his manhood by wresting the fortunes of defence- 
less women " — 

He pauses in indignation, his deep eyes glowing. 

Had he been Jasper they would be recipients of his 
bounty, no doubt. Regina raises her hand a trifle, and 
bends her head with a slight, haughty movement. 

"You may know" — she says faintly, "/ gave offence. 
After that " — 

A great joy leaps up in his soul. She could not love 
Jasper Bradley. Ah, he knew that ! 

"My queen," he says, "you will accept — what a man 
loves to offer to the woman dearest, to her and hers, with 
his life's devotion. Let me make amends. You were 
not meant to struggle with poverty, my beautiful darling. 
Your path should be over roses always." He comes nearer, 
he smiles with the sweetest satisfaction of his life. " Oh," 
tremulously, " you will give me this right now, to protect 
and shelter you, to surround you with all that is choicest, 
to keep you from any want or care " — 

An angry feeling sweeps imperiously through her pulses. 
"You think I would marry — is not that what you mean — 





for money ? To shelter myself from inconveniences, to 
sun myself on the borders of ease and delight, you — believe 
I would marry ! Your opinion of me must be high indeed!" 
and her scarlet lips close in infinite disdain. 

" It is not that alone ! " He takes a step forward and 
seizes her hand, almost crushes it in his grasp. "It is 
because I love you so much, and you — you may come to 
love me some day. I am willing to wait. Only — I want 
your life better, easier now. It maddens me to think of 
your petty sacrifices, your self-denial, your beautiful youth 
wasted, the fretting cares that like only one drop of water 
make an unendurable torment, that eat out all the sweetness 
of life. You are not fitted for that. I saw it long ago." 

"I am more cowardly than other women, than Cynthia — 
than any one who dares to struggle, who takes up her part 
of the burden ! " she says bitterly. That is the sort of 
womanly impress she has stamped upon his soul. She 
could despise herself in her exquisite shame, and she hates 
him for daring to unveil even one of her weaknesses. 

" No, I don't think you cowardly. When the true test 
came you would rise to it. I want to make your life just 
what it should be. You have only been circling around its 
grandest truths — but — "how shall he explain. Would 
she, being a woman, gain anything by a long, arduous 
struggle with poverty ? Would her middle life be rare 
and sweet and gracious when it had been rasped on every 
f side, hammered into steely resistance by opposing forces, 
when she had won — what ? the right to earn her bread and 
perhaps her mother's. For the friction in her case must 
be tremendous. 

"I have been making a poor pretence, I know it," and a 
dull flame flares up in her face, while shivers go through 
her veins. " I am not in any sense noble or true if I have 
impressed you with the belief that I shrink from the duties 
that are, that may be, laid upon me," Eegina makes answer 
incisively. 

" I can't argue rightly with you," he returns in a rather 
depressed tone. "Only — if there were anything you would 



 

like — a profession — a business — I would do all a brother 
could to help you to it. If you were making some great 
effort " — 

" But I have no genius," she declares bitterly. " I can 
never distinguish myself in the higher realms, such as art 
or literature. I couldn't be a doctor nor a lecturer," — she 
makes a haughty gesture of disdain with her hand as if 
she could strike down something. " I have a pretty face 
that might ornament some man's home who was fond of 
pictures and plates and jugs. And you propose to give 
that a proper setting. You are in a certain way sorry for 
me because poverty has come upon me, and you fancy it 
will fret me. Thank you " — 

"You will not understand," and he grasps her hand 
again in" both of his. . " I love you ! love you ! love you ! 
All that I can ever get will not be enough to lay at your feet, 
and I have no fear now for my own prosperity. You shall 
live where you like — not in that wretched little Warwick ! 
You shall travel, you shall surround yourself with friends 
of your own choosing," he is wild enough in that moment 
to give up his own ideals for her sake, his cherished plans 
of being of some service to a small corner of the world. 

" Meanwhile, what will you do ? " she asks sharply. 

" Go on loving you. But I shall do that in any event 
until you are interdicted to me by some final act of your 
own, as only one act can." 

" I shall save you from any such sacrifice as that of being 
the husband of a woman mercenary enough to marry you 
simply for her own aggrandizement," she returns haughtily. 
" You are mistaken if you think you can buy me, even if I 
am not worth much." 

"I have not meant to buy you. I have hoped — you 
would love me a little. It would be only through love that 
you could take all else. It was not injustice to the sweet- 
est attribute of womanhood, it was simply that all my 
delight would be in giving." 

She does not understand the generous soul, so humble in 
its great love that it will wait for the ripe time of appreci- 



ation. He does not know then how badly he has pleaded 
his cause by not' putting himself in the foreground. He 
has frankly judged her from what he has seen, and he is 
willing to risk the latent heroism that will some time 
reach the surface. Must she light it all out by herself ? 

" Let us end this," she begins with a cold dignity that 
borders on contempt ; for herself, that she should have 
made it possible for any man to rate her thus ; for him,
