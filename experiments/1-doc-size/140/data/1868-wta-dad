is practicable, I shall see that you are supplied with it; but avoid the
common water. You will now resume your studies."
Mr. Hamblin took his place with the other professors, and the studies of
the ship went on as usual. The mail came on board, and, when school was
dismissed, the letters were distributed. The first lieutenant of the
Josephine and Duncan were invited to the main cabin to give their
evidence in regard to the trouble between Paul and the professor.
CHAPTER XVIII.
AN EXCURSION AMONG THE DIKES.
Terrill and Duncan, with the letters in their hands which they had just
received, entered the main cabin. They were called upon, in the presence
of Mr. Lowington and Mr. Hamblin, as well as Captain Kendall, to give
their testimony, which went to show that the commander was thoroughly
and heartily opposed to any demonstration against the obnoxious
instructor.
"What did Mr. Kendall say to you?" asked Mr. Hamblin.
"He asked me to use my influence with the fellows to prevent anything
being done, and wished me to let them all know that he would not
tolerate anything irregular," replied Duncan.
"Did he, indeed!" sneered Mr. Hamblin.
"He did, indeed," answered Duncan, with a twinkle of the eye.
"How happened he to say as much as this to you?" demanded the professor.
"Because, being an old friend and schoolmate of Captain Kendall, I
happened to tell him that the fellows were inclined to haze Mr.
Hamblin."
"To haze me!" exclaimed Mr. Hamblin.
"I understand that we are to tell the whole truth here," added Duncan,
who seemed to enjoy the confusion of the learned gentleman. "I didn't
hear of any particular plans; but the fellows kept hinting at
something."
"Did they, indeed?"
"They did, indeed."
"But you don't know what they were?"
"I do not, sir."
"Can you tell me who wrote the letter I asked you to translate?"
"No sir, I cannot."
Mr. Lowington asked some questions of the witness; and it was evident to
him that the disaffection on board of the Josephine was more general
than he had before suspected. Terrill was called upon to explain still
further the position of the captain; and Duncan opened his letters,
being, as all the boys were, anxious to hear from home. He had two
letters. Besides the one from his mother, there was another postmarked
at Cologne, which he read after he had finished the first.
As Duncan read this Cologne letter his face became quite red, and he was
not a little agitated. By the time he had finished both of them, the
first lieutenant had told all he knew in regard to the captain's
position. He was very candid in making his statement, and took no pains
to conceal the general disgust felt on board of the consort at the
conduct of Mr. Hamblin; and he took no pains to conceal the fact that he
shared the feelings of his shipmates.
"I should like to add something to my former statement, if you please,
Mr. Lowington," said Duncan, rising, with the Cologne letter in his
hand.
"What do you wish to add?" asked the principal.
"I know now who wrote the letter to Mr. Hamblin."
"Who?"
"Richard H. Linggold."
"Who is he?"
"He is an old schoolmate of mine, whom I met in Antwerp the afternoon we
first went ashore there," replied Duncan, who now appeared to be
considerably embarrassed.
"Was he a schoolmate of Mr. Kendall also?" demanded Mr. Hamblin, who was
more anxious to connect the letter with him than to promote the
discipline of the students.
"No, sir; I don't think Captain Kendall ever saw Linggold."
"We are to conclude, Duncan, that you put him up to this mischief,"
added Mr. Lowington.
"Yes, sir; I did," answered Duncan, candidly.
"Why did you virtually deny all knowledge of the letter when I appealed
to the ship's company before the suspension of Captain Kendall,"
continued Mr. Lowington, sternly.
"I will explain. I met Linggold in Antwerp, and spent an hour with him
at the HÃ´tel St. Antoine, where he was staying with his uncle. He wanted
to know about the academy squadron, and I told him all about both
vessels. As the trouble we had had in the Josephine was uppermost in the
minds of all of us, I told him all about that."
"Did you, indeed?'? said Mr. Hamblin.
"I did, indeed. I am willing to acknowledge that I intended to join with
the rest of the fellows in hazing Mr. Hamblin."
"Are you, indeed?" sneered the professor, so wrathy that it was
impossible for him to keep his seat, and he began to stride up and down
the cabin.
"I am, indeed. About a dozen of us were going to write letters to Mr.
Hamblin from all the big bugs, including Louis Napoleon, the King of
Holland, the King of Belgium, and all the Ministers of State whose names
we could find out."
"Were you, indeed?" gasped the savant, passing before the witness.
"We were, indeed. I told Linggold what we were going to do, and he
promised to help me, being a first-rate French and German scholar; but I
told him we didn't want any help, and that he would get me into a scrape
if he meddled with the matter. I meant to have the letters mailed in
some place where none of us ever went. I told Linggold I wanted him to
take the letters and mail them at Cologne, and other places he went to
in his travels; and he promised to do so. I didn't think of such a thing
as his writing any letter after what I said. I left him then, and
haven't seen or heard from him since till now. He must have written the
letter right off, and mailed it at once, for it came on board the
Josephine that night."
"Do you mean to say that you didn't know this letter was to be written?"
demanded Mr. Hamblin, sharply.
"Yes, sir."
"When I asked you to give me a translation of it, were you not aware
that it was a forgery?"
"I supposed it was."
"You knew it was!"
"No, sir; I did not. I had no knowledge whatever in regard to the
writer. It did not occur to me, after what had passed between Linggold
and me, that he wrote the letter. I believed it was done by some fellow
on board. When the captain was arrested, all the fellows tried to find
out who had sent the letter, but no one would acknowledge it."
"Did you write any letters of this description, Duncan?" asked the
principal.
"No, sir. I had two conversations with the captain; and when he asked me
to do what I could to prevent any tricks being played upon the
professor, I determined not to have anything to do with the letters, or
any practical jokes of any kind. I can bring a dozen fellows to prove
that I said all I could to keep them from playing any tricks."
"What does your friend say in his letter?"
"He says the joke was so good he couldn't resist the temptation to send
the first letter to the professor himself, and wants to know why I
didn't send the letters to him that I promised?"
"Why didn't you?"
"After what the captain said, I persuaded the fellows not to write the
letters, and I did not write any myself. This letter is on the same kind
of paper as that," added Duncan, pointing to that which Paul had.
"Are you satisfied, Mr. Hamblin?" asked Mr. Lowington.
"No, sir, I am not," replied the professor, decidedly. "It appears that
there was an organized conspiracy against me in the consort."
"But it does not appear that Captain Kendall had anything to do with
it," added the principal, mildly.
"These boys are deceitful."
"Some of them are," replied Mr. Lowington, taking his pen and writing a
few lines. "Duncan, I am not satisfied with your conduct."
"I am not satisfied with it myself, sir," answered Duncan. "Perhaps I
ought to have known where that letter came from when Mr. Hamblin asked
me to translate it; but I supposed some of the fellows on board had done
it."
"Didn't you recognize the writing of your friend?"
"No, sir; it is very much like that of half a dozen fellows on board."
"It is very much like Mr. Kendall's," said Mr. Hamblin.
