" I am happy to hear from the major ; and as for the 
rest, I feel that I have not yet begun to discharge my 
obligation to you. Why didn't you write to me before?" 

" I did not wish to burden you with any remembrance 
of such a humble individual as myself." 

" You are too modest by half, Captain Somers. I 
should not have known any thing about you if it hadn't 
been for General well, no matter who," laughed the 
senator. 

" Now, papa, you have cut short the most interesting 
story that ever was told ! " interposed Emma. 

" The captain must begin again, then. Of course, you 
will make my house your home while in the city." 

" Thank you, sir. I left my servant at the hotel." 

Senator Guilford insisted on sending for the servant 
and the baggage ; and, in half an hour, Alick was present 
to confirm the wonderful tale which Somers told of his 
captivity in Petersburg, to which Emma and her father 
listened with the most intense interest. 

Very much to his surprise, Captain Somers found him- 
self quite a lion in Washington. He was introduced to 
senators and representatives ; and on the following even- 
ing actually took the President of the United States by 
the hand, just as though he had been one of the patri- 
archs of Pinchbrook. 

In spite of all these brilliant surroundings, Somers 
was anxious to get home. He was too feeble to endure 


the excitement of the capital ; and, on the third day afte> 
his arrival, he started for home. When he reached 
Boston, by an unfortunate chance it was two hours 
before a train would start for Pinchbrook. As he had 
spent two days with a senator in Washington, and 
shaken hands with the President, he deemed himself 
qualified to call at No. , Rutland Street, where the 
carriage soon set him down. 

Lilian Ashford was at home ; and Captain Somers, who 
had faced a whole rebel brigade, trembled and blushed in 
the presence of the maiden like the veriest coward in the 
world. But it was some satisfaction to know that the 
other party was similarly affected. The young hero 
eould not exactly explain how he felt. It was a different 
sensation from that which had come over him in the 
presence of Emma Guilford. He experienced a feeling 
of awe before her, but he could talk as fast as ever ; 
while to Lilian he stammered, couldn't remember any 
thing, and made woful confusion in his words and in his 
ideas. 

AVhen the ice was broken, he succeeded in telling her 
something about his adventures in Virginia, and roused 
a very strong desire in her mind to see the wonderful 
Major de Banyan. But his brief hour expired all too 
soon : it faded in a moment, and seemed like a tale that 
was told. 

" I wore your socks at the battles of Savage's Station, 



 

Glendale, and White-oak Swamp, Miss Ashford," said 
he ; " aiid I shall keep them for future service of the 
same kind. If I am killed in battle, I shall be found 
with those socks on my feet." 

"Oh, I hope you won't be killed ! ' : exclaimed she 
with a shudder. 

" Well, I hope not ; but, as soon as I am able, I shall 
return to my duty." 

"What a brave fellow you are ! I shouldn't think you 
would dare to stand up before the cannons., and the 
muskets, and the bayonets." 

" When I feel like running away, I always think of 
my socks," said Somers. 



But the carriage had come for him, and Alick stood at 
the door waiting for his appearance. He took the little 
soft white hand in his own, and readily promised, when 
she invited him, to call again soon and see her grand- 
mother, who was out of town that day. Of course, 
Somers was deeply interested in the venerable old lady, 
and actually looked forward with intense pleasure to the 
anticipated visit. 

He was driven to the railroad station, and reached 
Pinchbrook at " high twelve," when the Pinchbrookers 
were just going to their dinners. Captain Barney, , as 
usual, was at the depot, and gave him a seaman's welcome 
home. He insisted upon being driven to the cottage 
before dinner ; and the old shipmaster, finding that Cap- 



 

tain Somers carried too many guns for him, gracefully 
yielded the point. 

"Bless my stars, if there ain't Thomas !" cried Mrs. 
Somers as she jumped up from the dinner-table, and 
actually upset the teapot in the operation. 

"How do you do, mother? How do you do, father?" 
exclaimed the young captain as he shook hands wkh his 
father and Gran'ther Green, kissed his mother, and 
hugged his sister. 

" How pale you look, Thomas ! " said his mother. "I 
declare, you are as thin as a hatchet ! How is your 
arm ? " 

" Better, mother : I shall be as good as new in a few 
days." 

" You look pale ; but your face is as nateral as life," 
said Gran'ther Green. " I don't know what we shall do 
with two cap'ns in the family." 

" I think we can manage that, gran'ther," replied 
Somers, as he took the place at the table which had been 
prepared for him. 

We drop the curtain upon the scenes which followed ;
