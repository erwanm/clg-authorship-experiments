a book, a magazine story, or a bit of verse with- 
out an instant decision to repeat the experiment. 
The inclination once indulged becomes insatiable. 
It is not altogether the gratified vanity of seeing 
one's self in print, for, before printing was, the 
composers and reciters of romances and songs 
were driven along the same path of unrest and 
anxiety, when once they had the least recogni- 
tion of their individual distinction. The impulse 
is more subtle than the desire for wealth or the 
craving for political place. In some cases it is 
in simple obedience to the longing to create ; in 
others it is a lower ambition for notoriety, for 
praise. 

In any case the experiment of authorship, in 
however humble a way, has an analogy to that 
other tempting occupation of making " invest- 
ments" in the stock-market: the first trial is 
certain to lead to another. If the author suc- 
ceeds in any degree, his spirit rises to another 
attempt in the hope of a wider recognition. If 



 

he fails, that is a reason why he should convince 
his fellows that the failure was not inherent in 
himself, but in ill-luck or a misdirection of his 
powers. And the experiment has another anal- 
ogy to the noble occupation of levying toll upon 
the change of values â€” a first brilliant success 
is often a misfortune, inducing an overestimate 
of capacity, while a very moderate success, recog- 
nized indeed only as a trial, steadies a man, and 
sets him upon that serious dihgence upon which 
alone, either in art or business, any solid fortune 
is built. 

Philip was fortunate in that his first novel 
won him a few friends and a little recognition, 
but no popularity. It excited neither envy nor 
hostility. In the perfunctory and somewhat 
commercial good words it received, he recog- 
nized the good-nature of the world. In the few 
short reviews that dealt seriously with his work, 
he was able, when the excitement of seeing him- 
self discussed had subsided, to read between the 
lines why The Puritan Nim had failed to make 
a larger appeal. It was idyllic and poetic, but 
it lacked virility; it lacked also simplicity in 
dealing with the simple and profound facts of 
life. He had been too solicitous to express him- 
self, to write beautifully, instead of letting the 
human emotions with which he had to deal show 
themselves. One notice had said that it was too 




 

" literary"; by which, of course, the critic meant 
that he did not follow the solid traditions, the 
essential elements in all the great masterpieces 
of literature that have been created. And yet 
he had shown a quality, a facility, a promise, 
that had gained him a foothold and a support in 
the world of books and of the making of books. 
And though he had declined Mr. Ault's tempt- 
ing offer to illuminate his transcontinental road 
with a literary torch, he none the less was pleased 
with this recognition of his capacity and the 
value of his name. 

To say that Philip lived on hope during this 
summer of heat, suspensions, and business de- 
rangement would be to allow him a too substan- 
tial subsistence. Evelyn, indeed, seemed, at the 
distance of Newport, more unattainable than 
ever, and the scant news he had of the drama 
enacted there was a perpetual notice to him of 
the social gulf that lay between them. And yet 
his dream was sustained by occasional assurances 
from Miss McDonald of her confidence in Eve- 
lyn's belief in him, nay, of her trust, and she 
even went so far as to say affection. So he went 
on building castles in the air, which melted and 
were renewed day after day, like the transient 
but unfailing splendor of the sunset. 

There was a certain exaltation in this indul- 
gence of his passion that stimulated his creative 




 

faculties, and, while his daily tasks kept him from 
being morbid, his imagination was free to play 
with the construction of a new story, to which 
his recent experience would give a certain solid- 
ity and a knowledge of the human struggle as 
it is. He found himself observing character 
more closely than before, looking for it not so 
much in books as in the people he met. There 
was Murad Ault, for instance. How he would 
like to put him into a book ! Of course it would 
not do to copy a model, raw, like that, but he 
fell to studying his traits, trying to see the com- 
mon humanity exhibited in him. Was he a type 
or was he a freak ? This was, however, too dan- 
gerous ground until he knew more of life. 

The week's vacation allowed him by his house 
was passed in Eivervale. There, in the calmness 
of country life, and in the domestic atmosphere 
of affection which believed in him, he was far 
enough removed from the scene of the spectres 
of his imagination to see them in proper per- 
spective, and there the lines of his new venture 
were laid down, to be worked out later on, he 
well knew, in the anxiety and the toil which 
should endue the skeleton with life. Eivervale, 
to be sure, was haunted by the remembrance of 
Evelyn ; very often the familiar scenes filled him 
with an intolerable longing to see again the eyes 
that had inspired him, to hear the voice that was 





like no other in the world, to take the little hand 
that had often been so frankly placed in his, and 
to draw to him the form in which was embodied 
all the grace and tender witchery of womanhood. 
But the knowledge of what she expected of him
