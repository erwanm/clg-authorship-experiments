at all. 

He got himself away from her as soon as he 
conscientiously could. He was not accustomed to 
young ladies who desired his professional visits 
shortened. 

Mr. Rollinstall Sterling followed the doctor to 
the piazza, and laid a trembling hand upon his 
arm. 

" Is it possible," he asked unsteadily, " that my 
daughter has inherited my difficulties ? Is there 
— do you see — any signs of an affection of the 
heart ? " 

" The organ is as sound as mine," returned the 
young physician, with some unnecessary sharpness. 
" I tell you, sir, this is nothing but shock. 
Some men would call it a nervous sinking turn. I 

 

prefer the term shock. It covers the case. If she 
had a disease of the heart, Mr. Sterling, your 
daughter might have dropped, under what she has 
been through. It is an unusual physique — highly 
organized, sensitive to timidity, yet she has pluck 
enough and nerve enough to — I never saw 
anything like it, that 's all ! " concluded Chanceford 
Dane. With brilliant eyes he told the old man the 
story. 

Before Dane had finished his late supper, which 
Nannie (it being her cook's day out) was somewhat 
slow in serving, his telephone called imperiously, 
and he was summoned back to Rollinstall 
Sterling's house; but the call came from the 
chronic patient. Mr. Sterling was suffering one 
of the habitual miseries known as his attacks; 
and his daughter, pale as a pear blossom, and 
slender, in a loose, misty gown, was in close 
attendance upon her father. The door into her 
own room was opened from his (she had not 
allowed herself, as the doctor knew, to sleep out of 
reach of the sick man's call for many months), 
and once or twice she passed in and out on some 
errand. 

It was an arched door, and gave something of 
the effect of a vista to a dim perspective in which 
everything seemed to be white, with a possible 

 

blush as faint as the beginnings of dawn upon 
the walls. The girl stood on the threshold,
austere and sweet; her dress looked vague, like the 
pearl-white fog that was sweeping in with the 
easterly from the open sea. The young man 
dared not raise his eyes to her. The physician 
busied himself assiduously with her father. He 
and Cara Sterling did not talk. Once he had 
said, " Where is Clyde ? " and Cara had replied, 
"Shut up in the sewing-room. I told him," she 
added very sadly, "that I should have to punish 
him." 

Dr. Dane did not ask the young lady how she 
felt this evening. It occurred to him that she 
was not without gratitude for the omission. She 
had never been his patient. It also occurred to 
him that she never meant to be. 

When he came out through the dim drawing- 
room a powerful figure rose from one of the 
wicker chairs beside the cretonne sofa. It was the 
Reverend Sterling Hart, who had come to inquire 
for his cousin. 

"After such a shock," he said, "I thought she 
must feel it. When I learned that you were in the 
house, I stayed to ask you." 

There was a slight constraint in the clergyman's 
manner. Dane was somehow reminded that he was 
the village doctor. He replied with some dignity 



in his own demeanor, under which the attitude of 
the other became more cordial. 

"Can I do anything, do you think, if I remain?" 
asked Hart, with a boy-like timidity which was at 
times characteristic of the man. 

" They are both quite comfortable now," replied 
Dane. "Miss Sterling meant to retire, I think. 
She ought not to have been up and about at all." 
He passed out without further words. His feet rang 
on the gravel, and he held his handsome head well 
up. In spite of himself his heart sang in an 
undertone. It was full moonlight, and the world seemed 
to be listening for something. At the end of the 
long, wooded avenue he met the surgeon, walking 
eagerly in the warm light. 

"You, too, Thomas?" said Chanceford Dane, 
stopping short. 

" Et tu Brute?" replied Frost, smiling steadily. 

"You won't see her," added the physician over 
his shoulder. "She isn't fit for it — to-night." 

He could not quite keep the note of privilege 
out of his voice. He hurried on, and out into 
the road; it ran like a river of light through the 
wide country. The fog had shifted, and was 
veering out. The sea called loudly, like something 
thwarted in a purpose. No carriages were at the 
moment passing, and the bright road was still. 



Some people on the hotel cliffs were singing, — 
such songs as everybody knew, — and the mel- 
ody swung towards him, muffled by distance and 
foliage: — 

" Oh, promise me that some day you and I 
Will take our love together to some sky ! " 

The thick trees, black-green, and with leaves 
looking solid as metal, intervened like an embossed 
shield between himself and the house that 
he had left. As he stood gazing and dreaming, 
these changed their form to his stimulated fancy, 
and grew large and formidable, like the bastions
