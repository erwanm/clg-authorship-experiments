Madge started. Death was a vague idea to her of 
Bomething that might happen days hence. 

"But the poor child is ready any moment. I never 
saw any one so grateful, and I am so glad she was brought 
here. Sick people cannot have many comforts in such 
poor homes, even when those around them do their bestj 
and Mrs. Brown is an untidy termagant. She was so 
afraid to have Jenny dependent on charity, and yet she 
has never sent her a sixpence worth since she has been 
here. "Not that I care, though ; " with an odd smile. 

Yet for all this kindness, Mrs. Brown was continually 
saying ungracious things about the " old maid's ruin," as 
she termed it. " Miss Hetty looked fine, sticking herself 
up for a public benefactor. It was a great thing to have 
so much money that you didn't know what to do with it." 

Miss Hetty did not mind that, nor sundry other un- 
friendly criticisms. Here were work, duty, and the reward 
of a good conscience. Better far than be setting up for 
fine ladyhood and ease, when that would be quite foreign 
to her nature. 

Madge went up to Jenny presently. Through the soft 
May twilight they talked of the other country, of the love 
that purifies and exalts, giving courage to the trembling 
soul as it nears the solemn shore. Mrs. Farrand came in, 
and the two sang afterwards dear old hymns that make 
melody at the very gate of heaven. 

" I am going to sleep in the next room, Miss Ashbur- 
ton," said Catharine. " Miss Hetty says that by and by 
you had better come down with her." 

" When I am tired," returned Madge. 

Jenny slipped the wasted fingers within those so firm 
and warm. Darker grew the night for a while, and then 
the moon began to thread her path among the stars 
There was no continuous talking now, but fragments of 
sentences and precious promises. 





And through the pauses some old remembrance! 
thronged to Madge's busy brain. How long ago it seemed 
since she was the happy girl who had slumbered here so 
unconsciously ! What had God meant by giving her a brief 
taste of the cup of joy? That she should learn how many 
things some souls miss forever how that, in some lives, 
there is no spring and no summer? Perhaps. To turn 
the wild, untrained blossoms into tender graces, to take 
away the support to which she might cling, BO that, liko 
the palm, she could grow into steady self-reliance. 

Jenny dozed quietly. Madge at length leaned her head 
over on the pillow in a vague, dreamy mood. Once she 
had fancied her work almost done, and would have been 
content to die now she was glad to live. The world 
was bright and busy again. 

She started suddenly. Jenny clasped her hand tighter. 

"O," she murmured, "don't leave me! I want you to 
go clear to heaven's gate. ' Him that cometh to me I will 
in no wise cast out.' " 

" It is the invitation of the King of Glory." 

Yes." 

There was a little shudder, a strange clinging to the 
brave, steady hand. Madge bent over and pressed her 
lips to the forenead. After that, a kind of awesome, mid 
night silence. 

Catharine, hearing the stir, came in presently. 

" Had you not better go down to Miss Hetty ? " she 
whispered, softly. 

" No, I promised to stay. She is quiet, and has not ap- 
peared to suffer any." 

" She will never suffer again." 

As Madge raised her hand in surprise, the nerveless 
fingers slipped away. And she knew then that Jenny had 
passed over the river. All the sting of pain and sin had 
been taken out of this last moment. 

"Unto God we commend her," said Catharine, gentlj 



 

raising Madge. " Go down to Miss Hetty, but do not 
disturb any one else." 

The moonlight was streaming in all the windows. How 
wide and lonesome the world seemed for the sake of the 
one soul which had gone out of it! 

Miss Hetty took her in and soothed the throbbing 
pulses, gathering her to her fond, capacious heart. For the 
whole world was of kin to her now, and children would 
praise her who had never called her mother. Is the love 
of such women wasted ? Is their household a failure ? 

They missed Jenny Yates sadly. Her exceeding pa- 
tience and thankfulness had seemed to make a sunny spot 
in the house. Granny Bristow mourned her like a child 
perhaps more deeply than her own sister. 

" One gets so attached to them," said Miss Hetty, be- 
tween a sob and a smile, " that one hates to let them go. 
But with all our eflforts, we can never quite make a 
heaven." 

If we could, we should hardly need the other country. 
And therefore our works and affections here must needs 
be imperfect. 







CHAPTER XXIV. 

BETWEEN TWO. 

IT was a lovely June morning. Madge Ashburton had 
brought the roses to her cheeks by her work among the 
flowers, though they were seldom missing now. Her
