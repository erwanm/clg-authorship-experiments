world's reception of it? And now suddenly a wild idea 
came to him. He had heard somewhere that it is the 
women who read fiction. And was not Corydon a per- 
fect specimen of the average middle-class young lady, 
and therefore of that mysterious potentiality, "the 
public", to which he must appeal? Why not see what 
she would think of it? 

He took the plunge. "Would you like me to read it 
to you?" he asked. 

m* 

"Why, certainly," she replied, and then added, 
gently, "If it wouldn't be a desecration." 

"Oh, no," said Thyrsis. "You see, when it's been 
printed, all sorts of people will read it." 

So he went back to the house and brought the 
precious manuscript; and he placed Corydon in the 
seat of inspiration, and sat beside her and read. 

In many ways this was a revolutionary romance. 
Thyrsis had not spent any of his time delving into 
other people's books for "local color" ; he was not re- 
lying for his effects upon gabardines and hauberks, 
and a sprinkling of "Yea, sires," and "prithees." His 



 

castle was but the vaguely outlined background of a 
stage upon which living hearts wrought out their pas- 
sions. One saw the banquet-hall, with its tapestries and 
splendor, and the master of it, the man of force ; there 
were swift scenes that gave one a glimpse of the age- 
long state of things 



Right forever on the scaffold, 
Wrong forever on the throne." 



There was a quarrel, and a cruel sentence about to be 
executed; and then the minstrel came. His fame had 
come before him, and so the despot, in half-drunken 
playfulness, left the deciding of the quarrel to him. 
He was brought to the head of the table, and 
the princess was led in ; and so these two met face to 
face. 

Here Thyrsis paused, and asked, "Are you inter- 
ested?" 

"Go on, go on," said Corydon. 

So he read about his princess, who was the embodi- 
ment of all the virtues of the unknown goddess of his 
fancy. She was proud yet humble, aloof yet compas- 
sionate, and above all ineffably beautiful. And as for 
the minstrel 

"The minstrel was fair and young. 
His heart was of love and fire." 

He took his harp, and first he pacified the quarrel, 
and then he sang to the lady. He sang of love, and 
the poet's vision of beauty ; but most of all he sang of 
the free life of the open. He sang of the dreams and 
the spirit-companions of the minstrel, and of the 
Wondrous magic that he wields 



 

"Secrets of all future ages 

Hover in mine ecstasy ; 
Treasures never known to mortals 
Hath my fancy hid for thee !" 

He sang the spells that he would weave for her, the far 
journeys she should take 

"For thy soul a river flowing 

Swiftly, over golden sands, 
With the singing of the steersman 
Stealing into wonderlands!" 



2. THIS song was as far as Thyrsis had written, 
and he paused. Corydon was sitting with her hands 
clasped, and a look of enthrallment upon her face. "Oh, 
beautiful! beautiful!" she cried. 

A thrill of pleasure went through the poet. "You 
like it, then?" he said. 

"Oh, I like it !" she answered. And then she gazed 
at him, with wide-open eyes of amazement. "But you! 
You !" she exclaimed. 

"Why not I?" he asked. 

"How in the world did you do it? Where did you 
get it from?" 

"It is mine," said Thyrsis, quickly. 

"But I can't imagine it! I had no idea you were 
interested in such things!" 

"But how could you know what I am interested in?" 

"I see how you live apart from everybody. And 
you spend all your time in books!" 

Thyrsis suddenly recollected something which had 
amused him very much. Corydon had been reading 



 

"Middlemarch," and had told him that Dr. Casaubon 
reminded her of him. "And so I'm still just a book- 
worm to you!" he laughed. 

"But isn't your interest in things always intellect- 
ual?" she asked. 

"Then you suppose I'm doing this just as an exer- 
cise in technique?" he countered.
