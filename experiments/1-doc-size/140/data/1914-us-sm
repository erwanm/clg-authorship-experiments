what I felt. I suppose he has always had what 
he wanted, and he simply does not know what it is 
to be denied. It wasn't only a physical thing, I 
think; it was an affront to his pride, a denial of 
his authority." She stopped, and I saw her 
shudder. 

"I have been through it all," I said. 

"He wanted to know how long I expected to 
withhold myself. I said, ' Until I have got this 
disease out of my mind, as well as out of my body; 
xmtil I know that there is no possibility of either of 
us having it, to give to the other.' But then, 
after I had taken a little more time to think it over, 



 

I said, 'Douglas, I must be honest with you. I 
shall never be able to live with you again. It 
is no longer a question of your wishes or mine — 
it is a question of right or wrong. I do not love 
you. I know now that it can never under any 
circumstances be right for a woman to give her- 
self in the intimacy of the sex-relation without 
love. When she does it, she is violating the 
deepest instinct of her natm-e, the very voice of 
God in her soul.' 

"His reply was, 'Why didn't you know that 
before you married?' 

"I answered, 'I did not know what marriage 
meant; and I let myself be persuaded by others.' 

" 'By your own mother!' he declared. 

"I said, 'A mother who permits her daughter 
to commit such an offense is either a slave-dealer, 
or else a slave.' — Of course, he thought I was out 
of my mind at that. He argued about the duties 
of marriage, the preserving of the home, wives 
submitting themselves to their husbands, and so 
on. He would not give me any peace " 

And suddenly she started up. I saw in her eyes 
the light of old battles. "Oh, it was a horror!" 
she cried, beginning to pace the floor. "It seemed 
to me that I was living the agony of all the loveless 
marriages of the world. I felt myself pursued, 
not merely by the importimate desires of one 
man — I suffered with all the millions of women who 
give themselves night after night without love! 
He came to seem like some monster to me; I 
coxild not meet him unexpectedly without starting. 



 

I forebade him to mention the subject to me again, 
and for a long time he obeyed. But several weeks 
ago, he brought it up afresh, and I lost my self- 
control completely. 'Douglas,' I said, 'I can 
stand it no longer! It is not only the tragedy of 
my blind child — it's that you have driven me to 
hate you. You have crushed all the life and joy 
and youth out of me! You've been to me like a 
terrible black cloud, constantly pressing down on 
me, smothering me. You stalk around me like 
a grim, sepulchral figure, closing me up in the 
circle of your narrow ideas. But now I can en- 
dure it no longer. I was a proud, high-spirited 
girl, you've made of me a colorless social autom- 
aton, a slave of your stupid worldly traditions. 
I'm turning into a feeble, complaining, discon- 
tented wife! And I refuse to be it. I'm going 
home — where at least there's some human spon- 
taneity left in people; I'm going back to my 
father!' — And I went and looked up the next 
steamer!" 

She stopped. She stood before me, with the 
fire of her wild Southern blood shining in her 
cheeks and in her eyes. 

I sat waiting, and finally she went on, "I won't 
repeat all his protests. When he found that I 
was really going, he offered to take me ia the 
yacht, but I wouldn't go in the yacht. I had got 
to be really afraid of him — sometimes, you know, 
his obstinacy seems to be abnormal, almost in- 
sane. So then he decided he would have to 
go in the steamer with me, to preserve appear- 



 

ances. I had a letter saying that Papa was not 
well, and he said that would serve for an excuse. 
He is going to Castleman County, and after he 
has stayed a week or so, he is going off on a 
hunting-trip, and not return." 

"And will he do it?" 

"I don't think he expects to do it at present. 
I feel siire he has the idea of starting Mamma to 
quoting the Bible to me, and breaking me down 
with her tears. But I have done all I can to make 
clear to him that it will make no difference. I 
told him I would not say a word about my inten- 
tions at home until he had gone away; and that I 
expected the same silence from hun. But of 

course " She stopped abruptly; and after 

a moment she asked, "What do you think of it, 
Mary?" 

I leaned forward and took her two hands in mine. 
"Only," I said, "that I'm glad you fought it out 
alone! I knew it had to come — and I didn't 
want to have to help you decide!" 



 



 

She sat for a while absorbed in her own thoughts. 
Knowing her as I did, I understood what intense 
emotions were seething within her, what a terrific 
struggle her decision must have represented.
