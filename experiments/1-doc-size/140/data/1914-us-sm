much to do with shaping his character, and whom 
Sylvia described to me, sitting at her dinner- 
table and bewailing the folly of people who 
"admitted things". That was what made trouble 
for family lawyers — not what people did, but 
what they admitted. How easy it was to ignore 
impertinent questions! And how few people had 
the wit to do it! — It seemed as if the shade of 
the thin-hpped old family lawyer were standing 
by Douglas van Tuiver's side. 

In a last desperate effort, I cried, "Even sup- 
pose that I grant your request, even suppose I 



 

agree not to tell Sylvia the truth — still the day- 
will come when you will hear from her the point- 
blank question: 'Is my child blind because of 
this disease?' And what will you answer?" 

He said, in his cold, measured tones, "I will 
answer that there are a thousand ways in which 
the disease can be innocently acquired." 

For a long time there was silence between us. 
At last he spoke again, and his voice was as emo- 
tionless as if we had just met: "Do I understand 
you, madam, that if I reject your advice and 
refuse to tell my wife what you call the truth, 
it is your intention to tell her yourself?" 

"You understand me correctly," I replied. 

"And may I ask when you intend to carry out 
this threat?" 

"I win wait," I said, "I will give you every 
chance to think it over — to consult with the 
doctors, in case you wish to. I will not take the 
step without giving you fair notice." 

"For that I am obliged to you," he said, with 
a touch of irony; and that was our last word. 



 



 

Our island was visible in the distance, and I 
was impatient for the time when I should be 
free from this man's presence. But as we drew 
nearer, I noticed a boat coming out; it proved 
to be one of the smaller launches, heading directly 
for us. Neither van Tuiver nor I spoke, but 
both of us watched it, and he must have been 
wondering, as I was, what its purpose could be. 
When it was near enough, I made out that its 
passengers were Dr. Perrin and Dr. Gibson. 

We slowed up, and the other boat did the 
same, and they lay within a few feet of each 
other. Dr. Perrin greeted van Tuiver, and after 
introducing the other man, he said, "We came 
out to have a talk with you. Would you be so 
good as to step into this boat?" 

"Certainly," was the reply. The two launches 
were drawn side by side, and the transfer made; 
the man who was nmniag the smaller laimch 
stepped into ours — evidently having been in- 
structed in advance. 

"You will excuse us, please?" said the little 
doctor to me. The man who had stepped into 
our launch spoke to the captain of it, and the 
power was then put on, and we moved away a 
sufficient distance to be out of hearing. I thought 
this a strange procedure; but I conjectured that 
the doctors had become nervous as to what I 



 

might have told van Tuiver. So I dismissed 
the matter from my mind, and spent my time 
reviewing the exciting adventure I had just 
passed through. 

How much impression had I made? It was 
hard for me to judge such a man. He would 
pretend to be less concerned than he actually 
was. But surely he must see that he was in 
my power, and would have to give way in the 
end! 

There came a hail from the little vessel, and 
we moved alongside again. "Would you kindly 
step in here with us, Mrs. Abbott?" said Dr. 
Perrin; and when I had done so, he ordered the 
boatman to move away once more. Van Tuiver 
said not a word; but I noted a strained look 
upon his face, and I thought the others seemed 
agitated also. 

As soon as the other vessel was out of hear- 
ing, Dr. Perrin tiuTied to me, and said, "Mrs. 
Abbott, we came out to see Mr. van Tuiver, 
to warn him of a distressing accident which has 
just happened. Mrs. van Tuiver was asleep in 
her room, and Miss Lyman and another of the 
nurses were in the next room. They indiscreetly 
made some remarks on the subject which we 
have all been discussing — how much a wife should 
be told about these matters; and suddenly they 
discovered Mrs. van Tuiver standing in the door- 
way of the room." 

My gaze had turned to Douglas van Tuiver. 
"So she knows?" I cried. 



 

"We don't think that she knows; but she 
has a suspicion, and is trying to find out. She 
asked to see you." 

"Ah, yes!" I said. 

"She declared that she wished to see you as 
soon as you returned — that she would not see
