They had got down to Charles Street, and Halleck 
took out his watch at the corner lamp. " It isn 't 
at all late yet, only half-past eight. The days are 
getting shorter." 

" Well ? " 

" Suppose we go and call on Hubbard now ? He 's 
right up here on Clover Street ! " 

" I don 't know," said Atherton. " It would do for 
you ; you 're an old friend. But for me, wouldn 't 
it be rather unceremonious ? " 

"Oh, come along! They ll not be punctilious. 
They 'll  like our dropping in, and I shall have Hub- 
bard off my conscience. I must go to see him sooner 
or later, for decency 's sake." 

Atherton suffered himself to be led away. "I 
suppose you won 't stay long ? " 



 

" Oh, no ; I shall cut it very short, said Halleck ; 
and they climbed the narrow little street where 
Marcia had at last found a house, after searching the 
South End quite to the Highlands, and ransacking 
Charlestown and Cambridgeport. These points all 
seemed to her terribly remote from where Bartley 
must be at work during the day, and she must be 
alone without the sight of him from morning till 
night. The accessibility of Canary Place had spoiled 
her for distances ; she wanted Bartley at home for 
their one-o clock dinner; she wanted to have him 
within easy call at all times ; and she was glad when 
none of those far-off places yielded quite what they 
desired in a house. They took the house on Clover 
Street, though it was a little dearer than they ex 
pected, for two years, and they furnished it, as far as 
they could, out of the three or four hundred dollars 
they had saved, including the remaining hundred 
from the colt and cutter, kept sacredly intact by 
Marcia. When you entered, the narrow staircase 
cramped you into the little parlor opening out of the 
hall; and back of the parlor was the dining-room. 
Overhead were two chambers, and overhead again 
were two chambers more ; in the basement was the 
kitchen. The house seemed absurdly large to people 
who had been living for the last seven months in one 
room, and the view of the Back Bay from the little 
bow-window of the front chamber added all out 
doors to their superfluous space. 

Bartley came himself to answer Halleck 's ring, 
and they met at once with such a "Why, Halleck ! 
and " How do you do, Huhhard ? " as restored some 
thing of their old college comradery. Bartley wel 
comed Mr. Atherton under the gas-light he had 
turned up, and then they huddled into the little par 
lor, where Bartley introduced his old friend to his 
wife, Marcia wore a sort of dark robe, trimmed 



 

with bows of crimson ribbon, which she had made 
herself, and in which she looked a Eornan patrician 
in an avatar of Boston domesticity ; and Hartley wa$ 
rather proud to see his friend so visibly dazzled by 
her beauty. It quite abashed Halleck, who limped 
helplessly about, after his cane had been taken from 
him, before he sat down, while Marcia, from the van 
tage of the sofa and the covert of her talk with Ath- 
erton, was content that Halleck should be plain and 
awkward, with close-cut drab hair and a dull com 
plexion ; she would not have liked even a man who 
knew Bartley before she did to be very handsome. 

Halleck and Bartley had some talk about college 
days, from which their eyes wandered at times ; and 
then Marcia excused herself to Atherton, and went 
out, reappearing after an interval at the sliding doors, 
which she rolled open between the parlor and din 
ing-room. A table set for supper stood behind her, 
and as she leaned a little forward with her hands each 
on a leaf of the door, she said, with shy pride, " Bart 
ley, I thought the gentlemen would like to join you," 
and he answered, " Of course they would," and led the 
way out, refusing to hear any demur. His heart swelled 
with satisfaction in Marcia ; it was something like : 
having fellows drop in upon you, and be asked out to 
supper in this easy way; it made Bartley feel good, 
and he would have liked to give Marcia a hug on 
the spot. He could not help pressing her foot, un 
der the table, and exchanging a quiver of the eye 
lashes with her, as he lifted the lid of the white 
tureen, and looked at her across the glitter of their 
new crockery and cutlery. They made the jokes of 
the season about the oyster being promptly on hand 
for the first of the E months, and Bartley explained 
that he was sometimes kept at the Events office rather 
late, and that then Marcia waited supper for him, and 
always gave him an oyster stew, which she made her- 



 

self. She could not stop him, and the guests praised 
the oysters, and then they praised the dining-room and 
the parlor ; and when they rose from the table Bart- 
ley said, " Now, we must show you the house," and 
persisted against her deprecations in making her lead 
the way. She was in fact willing enough to show it ; 
her taste had made their money go to the utmost in 
furnishing it; and though most people were then still 
in the period of green reps and tan terry, and of dull 
black-walnut movables, she had everywhere bestowed 
little touches that told. She had covered the mar 
ble parlor-mantel with cloth, and fringed it ; and she 
had set on it two vases in the Pompeiian colors then 
liked ; her carpet was of wood color and a moss pat 
tern ; she had done what could be done with folding 
carpet chairs to give the little room a specious air of 
luxury ; the centre-table was heaped with her sewing 
and Bartley 's newspapers. 

"We 've just moved in, and we haven 't furnished 
all the rooms yet," she said of two empty ones which 
Bartley perversely flung open. 

"And I don 't know that we shall. The house is 
much too big for us ; but we thought we d better 
take it," he added, as if it were a castle for vastness. 

Halleck and Atherton were silent for some mo
