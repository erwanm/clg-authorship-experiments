If Jack had known the house ten years ago, he 
would have noticed certain subtle changes in it, 
rather in the atmosphere than in many alterations. 
The newness and the glitter of cost had worn off. 
It might still be called a palace, but the city had 
now a dozen handsomer houses, and Carmen's idea, 
as she expressed it, was to make this more like a 
home. She had made it like herself. There were 
pictures on the walls that would not have hung 
there in the late Mrs. Henderson's time ; and the 
prevailing air was that of refined sensuousness. 
Life, she said, was her idea, life in its utmost expression, untrammelled, and yes, a little Greek. 
Freedom was perhaps the word, and yet her latest 
notion was simplicity. The dinner was simple. 
Her dress was exceedingly simple, save that it had 
in it somewhere a touch of audacity, revealing in 
a flash of invitation the hidden nature of the woman. She knew herself better than any one knew 
her, except Henderson, and even he was forced to 
laugh when she travestied Browning in saying that 
she had one soul-side to face the world with, one 
to show the man she loved, and she declared he 
was downright coarse when on going out of the 
door he muttered, " But it needn't be the seamy 



side." The reported remark of some one who had 
seen her at church that she looked like a nun made 
her smile, but she broke into a silvery laugh when 
she heard Yan Dam's comment on it, " Yes, a devil 
of a nun." 

The library was as cozy as ever, but did not 
appear to be used much as a library. Henderson, 
indeed, had no time to add to his collection or enjoy it. Most of the books strewn on the tables 
were French novels or such American tales as had 
the cachet of social riskiness. But Carmen liked 
the room above all others. She enjoyed her cigarette there, and had a fancy for pouring her five- 
o'clock tea in its shelter. Books which had all 
sorts of things in them gave somehow an unconventional atmosphere to the place, and one could 
say things there that one couldn't say in a drawing-room. 

Henderson himself, it must be confessed, had 
grown stout in the ten years, and puffy under the 
eyes. There were lines of irritation in his face and 
lines of weariness. He had not kept the freshness 
of youth so well as Carmen, perhaps because of his 
New England conscience. To his guest he was 
courteous, seemed to be making an effort to be so, 
and listened with well-assumed interest to the story 
of her day's pilgrimage. At length he said, with 
a smile, "Life seems to interest you, Mrs. De- 
lancy." 





" Yes, indeed," said Edith, looking up brightly ; 
" doesn't it you ?" 

" Why, yes ; not life exactly, but things, doing 
things conflict." 

" Yes, I can understand that. There is so much 
to be done for everybody." 

Henderson looked amused. "You know in the 
city the gospel is that everybody is to be done." 

"Well," said Edith, not to be diverted, "but, Mr. 
Henderson, what is it all for this conflict ? Per- 
haps, however, you are fighting the devil?" 

" Yes, that's it ; the devil is usually the other 
fellow. But, Mrs. Delancy," added Henderson, 
with an accent of seriousness, " I dont know what 
it's all for. I doubt if there is much in it." 

" And yet the world credits you with finding a 
great deal in it." 

" The world is generally wrong. Do you under- 
stand poker, Mrs. Delancy ? No ! Of course you 
do not. But the interest of the game isn't so much 
in the cards as in the men." 

" I thought it was the stakes." 

" Perhaps so. But you want to win for the sake 
of winning. If I gambled it would be a question 
of nerve. I suppose that which we all enjoy is the 
exercise of skill in winning." 

" And not for the sake of doing anything just 
winning? Don't you get tired of that?" asked 
Edith, quite simply. 





There was something in Edith's sincerity, in her 
fresh enthusiasm about life, that appeared to strike 
a reminiscent note in Henderson. Perhaps he re- 
membered another face as sweet as hers, and ideals, 
faint and long ago, that were once mixed with his 
ideas of success. At any rate, it was with an ac- 
cent of increased deference, and with a look she 
had not seen in his face before, that he said : 

" People get tired of everything. I'm not sure 
but it would interest me to see for a minute how 
the world looks through your eyes." And then he 
added, in a different tone, " As to your East Side, 
Mrs. Henderson tried that some years ago." 

" Wasn't she interested ?" 

"Oh, very much. For a time. But she said 
there was too much of it." And Edith could detect 
no tone of sarcasm in the remark. 

Down at the other end of the table matters were 
going very smoothly. Jack was charmed with his 
hostess. That clever woman had felt her way 
along from the heresy trial, through Tuxedo and 
the Independent Theatre and the Horse Show, 
until they were launched in a perfectly free con- 
versation, and Carmen knew that she hadn't to 
look out for thin ice. 

"Were you thinking of going on to the Conven- 
tional Club to-night, Mr. Delancy ?" she was saying. 

"I don't belong," said Jack. "Mrs. Delancy 
said she didn't care for it."
