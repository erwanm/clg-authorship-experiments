" Well, it's very strange ! " Strether presently remarked I 
with a sighing sense of fulness. 

" Very strange indeed. That's just the beauty of it. 
Isn't it very much the kind of beauty you had in mind,"  
little Bilham went on, " when you were so wonderful and  
so inspiring to me the other day? Didn't you adjure me 
— in accents I shall never forget — to see, while I've a 
chance, everything I can ? — and really to see, for it must 
have been that only that you meant. Well, you did me 
no end of good, and I'm doing my best. I do make it out 
as a situation." 

" So do I ! " Strether went on after a moment. But he 
had the next minute an inconsequent question. " How 
comes Chad so mixed up, anyway ? " 

"Ah, ah, ah!" and little Bilham fell back on his 
cushions. 

It reminded our friend of Miss Barrace, and he felt 
again the brush of his sense of moving in a maze of mystic, 
closed allusions. Yet he kept hold of his thread. "Of 
course I understand really ; only the general transformation makes me occasionally gasp. Chad with such a voice 
in the settlement of the future of a little countess — no," 
he declared, " it takes more time ! You say, moreover," 
he resumed, " that we're inevitably, people like you and 
me, out of the running. The curious fact remains that 
Chad himself isn't. The situation doesn't make for it, but 
in a different one he could have her if he would." 

" Yes, but that's only because he's rich and because 
there's a possibility of his being richer. They won't think 
of anything but a great name or a great fortune." 





" Well," said Strether, " he'll have no great fortune on 
these lines. He must stir his stumps." 

" Is that," little Bilham inquired, " what you were saying 
to Mme. de Vionnet ? " 

" No — I don't say much to her. Of course, however," 
Strether continued, " he can make sacrifices if he likes." 

Little Bilham had a pause. " Oh, he's not keen for 
sacrifices ; or thinks, that is, possibly, that he has made 
enough." 

" Well, it is virtuous," his companion observed with 
decision. 

" That's exactly," the young man dropped after a 
moment, "what I mean." 

It kept Strether himself silent a little. " I've made it 
DUt for myself," he then went on ; " I've really, within the 
last half-hour, got hold of it. I understand it, in short, at 
last; which at first — when you originally spoke to me — 
I didn't. Nor when Chad originally spoke to me either." 

"Oh," said little Bilham, "I don't think that at that time 
 'ou believed me." 

" Yes — I did ; and I believed Chad too. It would have 
seen odious and unmannerly — as well as quite perverse — if 
I hadn't. What interest have you in deceiving me?" 

The young man hesitated. " What interest have I ?" 

" Yes. Chad might have. But you ? " 

" Ah, ah, ah ! " little Bilham exclaimed. 

It might, on repetition, as a mystification, have irritated 
iDur friend a little; but he knew, once more, as we have 
5een, where he was, and his being proof against everything 
 as only another attestation that he meant to stay there. 
' I couldn't, without my own impression, realise. She's a 
:remendously clever, brilliant, capable woman, and with an 
extraordinary charm on top of it all — the charm we surely, 
ill of us this evening, know what to think of. It isn't 
ivery clever, brilliant, capable woman that has it. In fact 
t's rare with any woman. So there you are," Strether 
Droceeded as if not for little Bilham's benefit alone. " I 
inderstand what a relation with such a woman — what such 
I high, fine friendship — may be. It can't be vulgar or 
;oarse, anyway — and that's the point." 

" Yes, that's the point," said little Bilham. " It can't be 





vulgar or coarse. And, bless us and save us, it is7it! It's . 
upon my word, the very finest thing I ever saw in my life, 
and the most distinguished." 

Strether, from beside him, and leaning back with him as 
he leaned, dropped on him a momentary look which filled 
a short interval and of which he took no notice. He only ; 
gazed before him with intent participation. " Of course 
what it has done for him," Strether, at all events, presently 
pursued, "of course what it has done for him — that is as to 
how it has so wonderfully worked — is not a thing I pretend 
to understand. I've to take it as I find it. There he is." !, 

" There he is ! " little Bilham echoed. " And it's really 
and truly she. I don't understand either, even with my 
longer and closer opportunity. But I'm like you," he  
added ; " I can admire and rejoice even when I'm a little  
in the dark. You see I've watched it for some three years,  
and especially for this last. He wasn't so bad before it as j
I seem to have made out that you think " 

"Oh, I don't think anything now!" Strether impatiently ;  
broke in : " that is but what I do think ! I mean that, 
originally, for her to have cared for him " 

" There must have been stuff in him. Oh yes, there was 
stuff indeed, and much more of it than ever showed, I 
dare say, at home. Still, you know," the young man in 
all fairness developed, " there was room for her, and that's 
where she came in. She saw her chance, and she took it. 
That's what strikes me as having been so fine. But of 
course he liked her first." 

" Naturally," said Strether. 

"I mean that they first met somehow and somewhere — I 
believe in some American house — and she, without in the 
least then intending it, made her impression. Then, with 
time and opportunity, he made his ; and after that she was 
as bad as he." 

Strether vaguely took it up. " As ' bad ' ? "
