 

two happy tears fell on his shoulder, where she buried 
her face after he had kissed it. 

The three entered the sitting-room. Joe looked cu- 
riously at the child, and said, " Why, I didn't think she 
was so large ! " 

Stephen removed her hat and cloak, and turned her 
around, facing Joe. " Have you ever seen her before ? " 
he asked. 

Joe gazed carelessly at first ; then the expression deep- 
ened. She came and put her hands on Hope's shoulders, 
and looked into her eyes. 

" Good Heavens, Stephen ! " she said. " It's Hope 
Vennard ! " 

It was the child's turn to wonder. She had been too 
full of grief to think or question before. Now, as she 
glanced from one to the other, she exclaimed, 

K How do you all know my name is Hope Vennard ? " 

Joe mutely appealed to Stephen for answer. 

The explanation must come some time. 

" We knew your father," he said. " We used to live 
in Tregony." 

" When he was when he died ? " For Hope stopped, 
shivering at the ugly word " murdered." Both her com- 
panions remarked it. Joe stole a sidelong glance at 
Stephen, which he felt, rather than saw. He made a 
great effort to obtain perfect mastery over himself, and 
answered, 





 

" Yes, we worked in the Foundery, both Mr. Adams 
and I. We left Tregony that autumn." 

Hope was studying Stephen attentively. She came 
close to him, and looked into his eyes. 

"I believe I remember ; " but her voice had a vague, 
confused sound, and her eyes wandered over him uncer- 
tainly. " I was in the Foundery one night, and a man 
held me up that I might look into a kettle of melted 
iron. He was so strong ! I used to think of it nights 
as I was falling asleep, and it gave me such a good, safe 
feeling. It was you." 

" Yes." Stephen breathed hard. 

M O, I am so glad to come back to you ! " and, with 
a little cry, Hope hid herself in the clasp of the strong 
arms again. 

A pang shot through Joe's waiting heart. As if 
already she was crowded out of her place. 

"This is my cousin Josephine," Stephen said pres- 
ently, bethinking himself. "And this is to be your 
home until you are tired of it, and want to go away." 

" I never shall," was Hope's confident rejoinder. 

And thus began a new era, not only in the life of 
Hope Vennard, but in that of both of the others. 
Stephen Dane meant to atone for his father's sin in 
his tender care of this friendless child. 



 



IX. 
LOVE. 

IT was strange how soon and how easily Hope Ven- 
nard settled herself in her new home. It was not 
natural that the death of Mrs. Forsyth should occasion 
any deep or permanent sorrow. She had never tried to 
attach Hope to herself until she became dependent upon 
her .kindly services as nurse ; and even then real love 
was lacking. And Hope just fitted into this empty 
niche in Stephen Dane's home. A noisy or demonstra- 
tive child must have worked a change ; with Hope every- 
thing went on as usual. And although Joe received 
her a trifle coldly at first, there was a silent charm about 
her that the elder could not resist. How it came to pass 
neither remembered, perhaps, but in a little while they 
were fast friends. Much of it was due to Joe's womanly 
longing for affection. And when the child laid her 
golden head in Joe's lap, or twined her soft arms about 
the other's neck, a warm sympathy grew up between 
them. I think Hope exercised a strong and mysterious 



 

sway by right of her beauty. It was a daily miracle to 
Joe. The soft, shining hair, floating out in rippling, 
golden waves; the clear, pearly complexion, with the 
delicate, peachy tint in the cheeks ; those large, wonder- 
ful eyes, in which you could seem to see the depths of 
her pure soul ; the grace of her figure'and every motion ; 
the hundred winsome ways, fascinated Joe as with a 
spell. 

Another charm was her voice. There was something 
peculiar in this, and it touched you nearly as much in 
her talking as in her singing. Stephen had added a 
piano since her coming, for her education had been in 
no wise neglected ; indeed, in music she had attained an 
unusual proficiency, for it had hitherto been the one 
solace of her life. To Katy in the kitchen this was a 
perfect marvel. More than once she said, "Miss Joe, 
if eber I git to heaben, I 'spect to hear jes' sich singin'. 
It's like the angels now." 

But the quiet evenings when they were alone pleased 
Joe the best, perhaps. With Hope's head in her lap, 
and the soft, white fingers clasping hers, dropping now 
and then a kiss, or pressing them with childish impulse 
against cheek and dimpled chin, and talking as no one 
ever had to Joe before. No wonder the poor, hungry
