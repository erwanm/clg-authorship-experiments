rent Florence ; of the wars of Guelf and 





 

Ghibelline; of the spirit that banished 
Dante, and gave him an humble tomb 
in Ravenna instead of a sepulchre in the 
pantheon of Santa Croce. Shakespeare 
was a child of his age ; it had long been 
preparing for him ; its expression culmi- 
nated in him. It was essentially a dra- 
matic age. He used the accumulated 
materials of centuries. He was play- 
wright as well as poet. His variety and 
multiform genius cannot otherwise be 
accounted for. He called in the coin- 
age of many generations, and reissued it 
purified and unalloyed, stamped in his 
own mint. There was a Hamlet prob- 
ably, there were certainly Romeos and 
Juliets, on the stage before Shakespeare. 
In him were received the imaginations, 
the inventions, the aspirations, the su- 
perstitions, the humors, the supernat- 
ural intimations ; in him met the con- 
verging rays of the genius of his age, as 




 

in a lens, to be sent onward thenceforth 
in an ever-broadening stream of light. 

It was his fortune to live not only in 
a dramatic age, but in a transition age, 
when feudalism was passing away, but 
while its shows and splendors could still 
be seriously comprehended. The dignity 
that doth hedge a king was so far abat- 
ed that royalty could be put upon the 
stage as a player's spectacle ; but the 
reality of kings and queens and court 
pageantry was not so far past that it 
did not appeal powerfully to the imag- 
inations of the frequenters of the Globe, 
the Rose, and the Fortune. They had 
no such feeling as we have in regard to 
the pasteboard kings and queens who 
strut their brief hour before us in ana- 
chronic absurdity. 

But, besides that he wrote in the 

spirit of his age, Shakespeare wrote in 

the language and the literary methods  



 

of his time. This is not more evident 
in the contemporary poets than in the 
chroniclers of that day. They all delighted in ingenuities of phrase, in neat 
turns and conceits; it was a compliment 
then to be called a " conceited" writer. 

Of all the guides to Shakespeare's 
time, there is none more profitable or 
entertaining than William Harrison, 
who wrote for Holinshed's chronicle 
" The Description of England," as it 
fell under his eyes from 1577 to 1587. 
Harrison's England is an unfailing mine 
of information for all the historians of 
the sixteenth century ; and in the edition published by the New Shakespeare 
Society, and edited, with a wealth of 
notes and contemporary references, by 
Mr. Frederick J. Furnivall, it is a new 
revelation of Shakespeare's England to 
the general reader. 

Harrison himself is an interesting 
character, and trustworthy above the 
general race' of chroniclers. He was 
born in 1534, or, to use his exactness 
of statement, "upon the 18th of April, 
hora 11, minut 4, Secunde 56, at Lon- 
don, in Cordwainer streete, otherwise 
called bowe-lane." This year was also 
remarkable as that in which " King 
Henry 8 polleth his head ; after whom 
his household and nobility, with the rest 
of his subjects do the like." It was the 
year before Anne Boleyn, haled away 
to the Tower, accused, condemned, and 
executed in the space of fourteen days, 
" with sigheingteares" said to the rough 
Duke of Norfolk, " Hither I came once 
my lord, to fetch a crown imperial; but 
now to receive, I hope, a crown immortal." In 1544, the boy was at St. 
Paul's school ; the litany in the English 
tongue, by the king's command, was 
that year sung openly in St. Paul's, and 
we have a glimpse of Harrison with the 
other children, enforced to buy those 
books, walking in general procession, as 
was appointed, before the king went to 
Boulogne. Harrison was a student at 
both Oxford and Cambridge, taking the 
degree of bachelor of divinity at the 
latter in 1569, when he had been an 
Oxford M.A. of seven years' standing. 
Before this he was household chaplain 
to Sir William Brooke, Lord Cobham, 
who gave him, in 1588-89, the rectory 
of Radwinter, in Essex, which he held 
till his death, in 1593. In 1586 he was 
installed canon of Windsor. Between 
1559 and 1 571 he married Marion Isebrande, of whom he said in his will, 
referring to the sometime supposed unlawfulness of priests' marriages, " by the 
laws of God I take and repute in all 
respects for my true and lawful wife." 
At Radwinter, the old parson, working 
in his garden, collected Roman coins, 
wrote his chronicles, and expressed his 
mind about the rascally lawyers of Es- 
sex, to whom flowed all the wealth of 
the land. The lawyers in those days ; 
stirred up contentions, and then reaped 
the profits. " Of all that ever I knew 
in Essex," says Harrison, " Denis and 
Mainford excelled, till John of Ludlow, 
alias Mason, came in place, unto whom
