Old men of Radwinter noted three 
things marvellously altered in England 
within their remembrance. The first 
was the multitude of chimneys lately 
erected ; whereas in their young days 
there were not, always except those in 
the religious and manor houses, above 
two or three chimneys in most upland 
towns of the realm ; each one made his 
'fire against a reredos in the hall, where 
he dined and dressed his meat. The 
second was the amendment in lodging. 
In their youth they lay upon hard straw 
pallets covered only with a sheet, and 
mayhap a dogswain coverlet over them, 
and a good round log for pillow. If in 
seven years after marriage a man could 
buy a mattress and a sack of chaff to 





 

rest his head on, he thought himself as 
well lodged as a lord. Pillows were 
thought meet only for sick women. As 
for servants, they were lucky if they 
had a sheet over them, for there was 
nothing under them to keep the straw 
from pricking their hardened hides. 
The third notable thing was the ex- 
change of treene (wooden) platters into 
pewter, and wooden spoons into silver 
or tin. Wooden stuff was plenty, but a 
good farmer would not have above four 
pieces of pewter in his house ; with all 
his frugality, he was unable to pay his 
rent of four pounds without selling a 
cow or horse. It was a time of idleness, 
and if a farmer at an ale-house, in a 
bravery to show what he had, slapped 
down his purse with six shillings in it, 
all the rest together could not match it. 
But now, says Harrison, though the rent 
of four pounds has improved to forty, 
the farmer has six or seven years' rent 
lying by him, to purchase a new term, 
garnish his cupboard with pewter, buy 
three or four feather-beds, coverlets, 
carpets of tapestry, a silver salt, a nest 
of bowls for wine, and a dozen spoons. 
All these things speak of the growing 
wealth and luxury of the age. Only a 
little before this date, in 1568, Lord 
Buckhurst, who had been ordered to 
entertain the Cardinal de Chatillon in 
Queen Elizabeth's palace at Sheen, 
complains of the meanness of the furni- 
ture of his rooms. He showed the offi- 
cers who preceded the cardinal such 
furniture and stuff as he had, but it did 
not please them. They wanted plate, he 
had none ; such glass vessels as he had 
they thought too base. They wanted 
damask for long tables, and he had only 
linen for a square table, and they re- 
fused his square table. He gave the 
cardinal his only unoccupied tester and 
bedstead, and assigned to the bishop the 
bedstead upon which his wife's waiting- 
women did lie, and laid them on the 
ground. He lent the cardinal his own 
basin and . ewer, candlesticks from his 
own table, drinking-glasses, small cush- 
ions, and pots for the kitchen. My 
Lord of Leicester sent down two pair 
of fine sheets for the cardinal and one 
pair for the bishop. 

Harrison laments three things in his 
day : the enhancing of rents, the daily 
oppression of poor tenants by the lords 
of manors, and the practice of usury â€” 
a trade brought in by the Jews, but now 
practised by almost every Christian, so 
that he is accounted a fool that doth 
lend his money for nothing. He prays 
the reader to help him, in a lawful man- 
ner, to hang up all those that take cent, 
per cent, for money. Another grievance, 
and most sorrowful of all, is that 
many gentlemen, men of good port and 
countenance, to the injury of the farm- 
ers and commonalty, actually turn gra- 
ziers, butchers, tanners, sheep-masters, 
and woodmen. Harrison also notes the 
absorption of lands by the rich ; the de- 
cay of houses in the country, which 
comes of the eating up of the poor by 
the rich ; the increase of poverty ; the 
difficulty a poor man had to live on an 
acre of ground ; his forced contentment 
with bread made of oats and barley, and 
the divers places that formerly had good 
tenants and now were vacant, hop-yards 
and gardens. 

Harrison says it is not for him to de- 
scribe the palaces of Queen Elizabeth ; 
he dare hardly peep in at her gates. 
Her houses are of brick and stone, neat 
and well situated, but in good masonry 
not to be compared to those of Henry 
VIII. 's building ; they are rather curi- 
ous to the eye, like paper-works, than 
substantial for continuance. Her court 
is more magnificent than any other in 
Europe, whether you regard the rich 
and infinite furniture of the household, 
the number of officers, or the sumptuous 
entertainments. And the honest chroni- 
cler is so struck with admiration of the 
virtuous beauty of the maids of honor 
that he cannot tell whether to award 
pre-eminence to their amiable counte- 
nances or to their costliness of attire, 
between which there is daily conflict and 
contention. The courtiers of both sexes 
have the use of sundry languages and 
an excellent vein of writing. Would to 
God the rest of their lives and conver- 
sation corresponded with these gifts ! 
But the courtiers, the most learned, 
are the worst men when they come 
abroad that any man shall hear or read 
of. Many of the gentlewomen have 
sound knowledge of Greek and Latin,
