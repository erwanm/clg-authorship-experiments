secure a position within talking distance of the coxswain of the Racer.

Before he could speak to Mad Twinker, the members of his crew began to
shout at him, telling him not to give up the clothes. The discipline in
this boat was no better than in the other. Dory repeated his request to
the remaining coxswain of the squadron.

"Don't give up the clothes!" yelled the crew.

"If you fellows are going to do the talking I have nothing to say, and I
shall follow the example of Wash Barker," added Mad Twinker; and he
plainly sympathized with his fellow coxswain who had resigned.

The Chesterfields did not like this answer, and they looked at one
another with something like dismay on their faces.

"Go ahead, Mad! We won't say another word," said the stroke oarsman. The
others made no promises, but for the time they were silent.

"I am waiting for your answer, Mr. Twinker," said Dory, when he thought
it was time for the officer of the Racer to speak.

"Suppose I decline to return them," replied Mad, who found it necessary
to say something, though it was clear that he had not decided what to
say. "What then?"

"I don't care to consider any question but the return of the clothes,"
replied Dory.

"Our fellows are not ready to return your clothes, after the insults you
have heaped upon us," answered Mad Twinker; and this answer was followed
by a clapping of hands.

"Am I to understand that you refuse to return our property?" asked Dory
gently but forcibly.

"We will compromise the matter if you like," suggested Mad Twinker, who
did not like the cool manner of the coxswain of the Winooski. "If you
will apologize for the insults heaped upon us, we will return the
garments in as good condition as when they were taken."
