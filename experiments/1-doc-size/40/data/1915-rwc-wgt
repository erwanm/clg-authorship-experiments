Karen bent over his hand and touched it with her lips.

The fever was gaining; he began to roll his blond head from side to
side, muttering of love and luck and of the glory of God and the German
Empire. A slight smile remained on his lips.

Before the automobile arrived from Trois Fontaines the fever seized him
fiercely. His coughing racked him incessantly now, and the first heavy
hemorrhage soaked his grey tunic and undershirt.

They eased him all they could, laying open his broad blond chest and the
ribs now terribly discoloured where his fall had crushed them in again
under the bandage.

How the man could have risen and come at him again Guild could not
understand. He was terribly shocked.

Dreadful sounds came from his laboured breathing; he lay with eyes
closed now, one burning hand lying in Karen's.

Toward four o'clock in the morning a far, faint sound penetrated the
room.

Von Reiter's eyes opened. "Halt!" he whispered. "Who goes there?"

It was Death. He seemed to understand that, for he sighed very lightly,
his hand closed on Karen's, and he lay gazing straight upward with
brilliant eyes.

A few moments later there came a rush, a crunching of gravel, the loud
purr of the motor outside.

Then Karen opened the door and a medical officer entered the room in
haste.

Guild turned to Karen: "I must go to the woods and bring in my men and
Darrel. Dearest, are you decided to go with me?"

"I could not remain here now. I do not wish to."
