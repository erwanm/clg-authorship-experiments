CHAPTER XVII.

RICHARD GIVES THE TUNBROOKERS A LESSON IN BOATING.


Among the favorite recreations of the cadets of the Tunbrook Military
Institute was that of boating. The beautiful lake afforded them
abundant space for sailing and rowing, and quite a number of them were
proficient oarsmen and excellent navigators.

On the Saturday afternoon following the return from the camp, Colonel
Brockridge proposed to exercise the boys in the boats. This
announcement was received with hearty applause by the cadets, and they
gathered round the principal to learn the order of exercises upon the
lake.

"Well, boys, suppose we appoint a couple of coxswains and have a race."

"Hurrah!" shouted the boys. "A race! A race!"

"You like the plan, I see. Who shall be your leaders?" added the
colonel.

The boys made no reply, but looked curiously at each other, as though
they were not competent, to settle the question.

"Nevers for one," said Redman.

"Very well; Nevers, we all know, is a good boatman, and has always won
the races. Who shall be the other?"

No reply was made, and the principal waited some time for a suggestion.

"Grant has had considerable experience with boats, his father informed
me," continued Colonel Brockridge.
