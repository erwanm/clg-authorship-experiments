should O to New York. I did not desire to 



accompany them, and I was sure they could 
choose as well for me as if I hunted the whole 
town over. Besides, I wanted the nice quiet 
time with papa, since I was the one who would 
have to go away. 

"Isn't it funny!  ' said Fan. "I feel like the 
heroine of some hundred year old novel, going 
up to town to buy wedding clothes, instead of 
a girl of the period of puffs, paniers, chignons, 
Grecian bends, and all that ! Why Rose, think 
of it! We have never had a silk dress in all 
our lives, except that once we had one ruffled 
with an old one of mamma's; and we have been 
very tolerably happy.' 
" Yes, just as happy as one need be. All 
that could be crowded into our small lives." 

'I dare say we should be absolute curios- 
ities to some people. Everybody now-a-days has 
a silk walking-suit, and some handsome thread 
lace, and I don't believe there are any poor 



 

people but just us. But then we have had thp 
love and comfort and enjoyment and no time to 
worry about our rich neighbors. It has been a 
life full of pleasantness and peace." 

That was true enough. There were many, 
many things beside raiment, if one could only 
get at the real completeness and harmony, the 
secret of soul life.
