“But,” said Alice, hesitatingly, “we are very poor. I never had anything
but my salary to depend upon, and now that is cut off.”

Helen stooped and whispered a few words in her ear.

“Five hundred dollars!” repeated Alice, in astonishment, “that is a
fortune. Who has been so generous?”

“Never mind!” said Helen, smiling. “You see, then, that you are not so
poor as you imagined. Now do you think, if I sent a carriage for you in
the course of the afternoon, you can move?”

“Yes,” said Alice, in a tone of deep thankfulness. “No one can tell how
much I detest this horrible place. I think it will make me well only to
move.”

Over the wasted face of her sister there stole an expression of deep and
thankful joy.

“I think you are an angel,” she said, looking up into Helen’s beautiful
face, radiant with sympathy.

Helen blushed.

“How pleasant it is to be able to make others happy!” she said, softly,
to Herbert.

“Do you know, Helen,” said the young artist, “I am half tempted to agree
with your patient there.”

“Brother Herbert,” said Helen, quickly, “you must not speak so. I am
only doing what you would do in my place. I don’t like to be praised for
only doing what is pleasant to me.”

Before night Alice and her sister were installed in a
comfortably-furnished room, with a nurse in attendance, who was directed
to do whatever was needful for the comfort and relief of her patients.
