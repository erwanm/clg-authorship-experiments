cousin?" 
Roderick frowned darkly, but assented. 
" Wouldn 't it give you pleasure, then, to see her?" 
Roderick turned away, and for some moments answered 
nothing. " Pleasure !" he said at last, huskily. " Pain 
will do as well !" 
"I regard you as a sick man," Rowland continued. 
" In such a case Miss Garland would say that her place 
is at your side." 
 
Roderick looked at him some time askance, mistrust 
fully. "Is this a deep-laid snare?" he asked, slowly. 
Rowland had come back with all his patience re 
kindled, but these words gave it an almost fatal chill. 
"Heaven forgive you!" he cried, bitterly. "My idea 
has been simply this try in decency to understand it. 
I have tried to befriend you, to help you, to inspire you 
with confidence, and I have failed. I took you from the 
hands of your mother and that girl, and it seems to me 
my duty to restore you to their hands. That 's all I have 
to say." 
He was going, but Roderick forcibly detained him. 
It would have been but a rough way of expressing it to 
say that one could never know how Roderick would take 
a thing. It had happened more than once that when 
hit hard deservedly he had received the blow with touch 
ing gentleness. On the other hand, he had often resented 
the softest taps. The secondary effect of Rowland 's 
present admonition seemed reassuring. "I beg you to 
wait," he said, " to forgive that shabby speech, and to let 
me reflect." And he walked up and down a while re 
flecting. At last he stopped, with a look in his face that 
Rowland had not seen all the winter. It was strikingly 
beautiful. 
"How strange it is," he said, "that the simplest 
devices are the last that occur to one !" And he broke 
into a light laugh. To see Mary Garland is just what 
I want. And my mother my mother can't hurt me 
now !" 
"You will write, then?"
