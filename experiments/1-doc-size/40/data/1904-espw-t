Miriam caught her breath. It was as if the 
recording angel had read from the Book of 
Life a sentence in an unknown tongue, and

Mrs. Percy B. Jeffries arrived at the town 
house the next morning, and Miriam found 
herself denied that luxury of solitude which, 
to a nature like hers, is the first craving of

well as with the mortification of the necessity 
for it. 
Before Mrs. Jeffries had time, or perhaps

you will doubtless by this time have been in-

resigning the presidency of the Society for 
the Prevention of Docking and Cropping
