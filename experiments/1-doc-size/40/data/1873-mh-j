supposed that it has its root in your fond recollection of your
lamented relative. Excuse the suggestion--but from what I have seen
of father and daughters, I am inclined to think them sensitive and
proud--as they have a right to be. Your tact hardly needed this
hint, however. There is a ring! I have loitered here shamefully! Do
you know that your beautiful drawing-room is likened, about town, to
Circe's cave?"




CHAPTER VI.


Mr. Wyllys was careful not to repeat his visit within a week. He
could trust to the natural growth of the seed he had sown, and he
was too politic to appear solicitous, on his own account, for the
resumption of cousinly intercourse between the houses of Baxter and
Kirke. He did not overrate his influence with the would-be leader of
Hamilton society. Four days after his party call, he had a note from
Jessie.


    "DEAR COUSIN ORRIN:

     "I enclose a letter received last night from Mrs. Baxter, wife
     of the President of Marion College. She is, I have learned from
     this, my nearest living relative, outside my immediate family
     circle, being my mother's first cousin. I never heard of her
     until the arrival of this communication. My father knew her,
     years ago, but did not remember whom she had married. I little
     imagined when I listened to Roy's praises of his friend, Dr.
     Baxter, that I had any personal interest in, or connection
     with his family. Mrs. Baxter writes, you see, in an
     affectionate strain, and is urgent in her request that I should
     pass the winter with her. My father and sister agree with me
     that you are the proper person to consult with regard to my
     answer to the invitation. You are, doubtless, acquainted with
     Mrs. Baxter, and are certainly more au fait to the usages of
     Hamilton polite society than we are.
