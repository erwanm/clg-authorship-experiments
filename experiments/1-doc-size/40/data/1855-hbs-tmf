"All what?" said William.

"Cousin," said she, not at all regarding what he said, "I was very much
vexed this afternoon."

"So I perceived, Mary."

"Well, it is vexatious," she continued, "though, after all, we cannot
expect people to think us perfect; but I did not think it quite fair in
you not to tell me."

"Tell you what, Mary?"

Here they came to a place where the road turned through a small patch of
woods. It was green and shady, and enlivened by a lively chatterbox of a
brook. There was a mossy trunk of a tree that had fallen beside it, and
made a pretty seat. The moonlight lay in little patches upon it, as it
streamed down through the branches of the trees. It was a fairy-looking
place, and Mary stopped and sat down, as if to collect her thoughts.
After picking up a stick, and playing a moment in the water, she
began:--

"After all, cousin, it was very natural in you to say so, if you thought
so; though I should not have supposed you would think so."

"Well, I should be glad if I could know what it is," said William, in a
tone of patient resignation.

"O, I forgot that I had not told you," said she, pushing back her hat,
and speaking like one determined to go through with the thing. "Why,
cousin, I have been told that you spoke of my manners towards yourself
as being freer--more--obtrusive than they should be. And now," said she,
her eyes flashing, "you see it was not a very easy thing to tell you,
but I began with being frank, and I will be so, for the sake of
satisfying myself."

To this William simply replied, "Who told you this, Mary?"

"My aunt."
