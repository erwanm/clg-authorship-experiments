Then she said in a low voice, " I am sorry, Mr. 
Leslie ; but I have just spent all my spare money 
upon those pearls." 
" The jeweller will take them back ; I will arrange it for you, if you wish," said the clergy-

The color deepened painfully in Sibyl's cheeks, 
and the tears came into her eyes, but she did not

Mrs. Leighton that I will meet her next week 
as she desired, my time is more than occupied, 
and I will ask Mr. Leslie to excuse me." 
She left the room, taking the pearls with her, 
and not a word more did Mr. Leslie say in allusion to her. He turned the conversation back 
to Margaret Brown, discussed the various arrangements for removing the family into the 
country, and then took his departure. 
" I was very sorry about the money, Aunt
