But the gray horizon was not light enough for them to be sighted. And
all hope was gone.
Bessie Stuart continued pointing to the vessel as if she were paralyzed
by fright.
"Row! Row!" she shrieked.
And Clif seized the oars frantically. But he knew that it was utterly
useless. The gunboat was coming on like a race horse.
And scarcely had he taken two strokes before the matter was settled
finally. For there came a puff of white smoke from the Spaniard's bow.
And almost at the same instant with a deafening, blinding crash, a solid

It plunged through, almost tearing the frail craft in half, hurling

Steadily the gunboat drew nearer; the two half-drowned Americans were
reached in a minute or two.
And the vessel slowed up and a rope was thrown to them. Clif desperate
from despair, seized it and drew himself close.
A couple of Spanish sailors leaned down from the low side and lifted
