sion-school. Maybe this was my Christmas! 
If doing for such a little chap was just the same 
as doing for the great Lord, and if He ’d say 
at the last, ‘Ben Hewes, I saw you that Christ- 
mas Eve, when you was too poor to send gifts 
to anybody, taking that half-starved little 
shaver in out of the cold, and I put it down in 
my ’count, and it ’s just as good as a rich man’s 
deed.’ So says I, ‘Come along. Jemmy. I ’ll 
give you a nice warm corner to sleep in, and a 
mouthful of supper. It ’s Christmas Eve, you

sweared, and I *m so cold. O, is it nice and 
warm in heaven? Betty said it was.* 
“ ‘Come to the fire, poor creetur,* says 
Mammy.

as if it had been the great Lord. 
“ *And we ’ll have some Christmas after all,’ 
says Kitty, ‘only not like rich folks.’ 
“Mammy was afraid he was froze, so I 
brought in some snow and rubbed his ears,
