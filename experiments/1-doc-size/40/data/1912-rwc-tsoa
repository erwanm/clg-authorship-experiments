"Will it--kill me, do you think?"

"I don't think so. Try it."

"Will it hurt?--this terrible fall? And how far must I descend to fall
in love with you?"

"Sometimes falling in love does hurt," he said gravely, "when the fall
is a long one."

"Is this to be a long one?"

"You may think so."

"Then I decline to tumble. Please go somewhere about your business,
Master Harlequin. I'm inclined to like you."

"Dancer, my life's business is wherever you happen to be."

"Why are you so sure?"

"Magic," he said seriously. "I deal in it."

"Wonderful! Your accomplishments overwhelm me. Perhaps, through the aid
of magic, you can even tell me who I am!"

"I think I can."

"Is that another threat of magic?"

"It's a bet, too, if you like."

"Are you offering to bet me that, before I unmask, you will be able to
discover who I am?"

"Yes. Will you make it a wager?" She stood, silent, irresolute,
cautious but curious; then:

"Do you mean that you can find out who I am? Now? Here in this
balcony?"
