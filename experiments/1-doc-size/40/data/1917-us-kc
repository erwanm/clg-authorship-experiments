The old Scotchman put in an objection. " The diffi- 
culty may be to get out of this house. I don't believe they 
mean to let you get away to-night." 

" By Jove, that's so ! " exclaimed Keating. " We're 
talking too much — let's get busy. Are they watching the 
back door, do you suppose ? " 

" They've been watching it all day," said MacKellar. 

" Listen," broke in Hal — " I've an idea. They haven't 
tried to interfere with your going out, have they, Mr. Keat- 
ing?" 

" No, not yet." 

" Nor with you, Mr. MacKellar ? " 

" No, not yet," said the Scotchman. 

"Well," Hal suggested, "suppose you lend me your 
crutches ? " 

Whereat Keating gave an exclamation of delight. 
"The very thing!" 

" I'll take your over-coat and hat," Hal added. " I've 
watched you get about, and I think I can give an imita- 
tion. As for Mr. Keating, he's not easy to mistake." 

" Billy, the fat boy ! " laughed the other. " Come, let's 
get on the job ! " 

" I'll go out by the front door at the same time," put in 
Edstrom, his old voice trembling with excitement. " May- 
be that'll help to throw them off the track."
