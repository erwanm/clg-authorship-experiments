— a very young man, hardly twenty in appearance, though 
he was twenty-two ; rather short, rather stout, with a 
round face and somewhat snubby nose ; such a very every- 
day-looking youth ! and — O grief of all I — called Johnny, 
Johnny McKnight. Had he done anything? Could he 
do any thing ? His face was simply good and youthful, 
not strong or mauly, or indicative of any force whatever. 

The gentleman on her other hand — she was hostess, 
and poured coffee ; and most delicious coffee it was too — 
was a handsome, black-eyed fellow, a war correspondent, 
who had come down the Mississippi with Grant, and 
seemed inclined to be sweet upon her as well. Evidently 
Miss Mollie was a favorite with gentlemen, in spite of her 
lack of beauty. Her meny audacity, her shrewd, whim- 
sical comments, her cool, laughable impertinences, made 
her a most attractive antagonist. Everybody except 
Mr. McKnight disputed with her : he simply agreed, and 
approved with unreasoning, beatific smiles. 

It was two o’clock when we went to bed ; but no one, 
save Hebe, rose before eight in the morning. She made 
roaring fires ; and the house was almost at a summer tem- 
perature. Mrs. Henderson took her breakfast in bed ; 
but the rest came down gradually, dropped into places 
around the breakfast-table, — a rather untidy lot, to be 
sure, in various styles of attire, and dilapidated shoes or 
slippers. 

“ What is on hand this morning? ” asked Jo, pushing 
her soft brown curls out of her sleepy brown eyes. 


 


“ I’m going to take Miss Durant to Studio Building. 
I told Bradley I should be there ; and I want her to see 
Reggy’s pictures,” said Mollie.
