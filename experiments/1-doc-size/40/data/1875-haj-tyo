Sixth and Seventh avenues. Sam decided to take the child into this
street, and see if he recognized it. The experiment proved successful.
Arrived in the street the child cried joyfully:--

"This is where I live."

"Can you find the house?"

"Yes; it's right on," said Bertie.

In brief, Sam took Bertie home. He found the family in great distress.
The nurse had returned, and declared incoherently that Master Bertie
had been carried off, and she couldn't find him anywhere. A message
was about to be sent to the police when the young truant was brought
home. The mother clasped him fondly in her arms, and kissed him many
times. Then she bethought herself of Sam.

"How can I thank you," she said gratefully, "for bringing my darling
home?"

"Oh, it's nothing," said Sam. "I was afraid at first I couldn't find
where he lived; but he told me his name, and I looked in the
directory."

Mrs. Dalton saw that Sam was ragged, and her grateful heart prompted
her to do something for him.

"Have you any place?" she asked.

"No," said Sam.

"Wouldn't you like one?"

"Yes, I should," said Sam, promptly. "It's hard work getting a living
about the streets."

"It must be," said the lady, with sympathy. "Have you no friends?"

"None, except poor boys like I am."
