LETTUCE SALAD—PLAIN.

Wash the lettuce; pull leaf from leaf, and pile over a lump of ice in a
salad-bowl. Pass the oil and vinegar, salt, pepper, and powdered sugar
to each person, with the lettuce, that he may season for himself.


PIE-PLANT (APRIL) FOOL.

  1 pint of stewed pie plant, rubbed through a colander.
  1 tablespoonful of butter.
  1 cup of sugar.
  Yolks of four eggs.
  Méringue of the whites.
  3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
  Juice of half a lemon.

Put the strained pie-plant into a saucepan; set it in boiling water,
and, when hot, beat in the butter, sugar, and beaten yolks. Stir two
minutes, and turn out to cool. This can be done on Saturday. On Sunday,
a few minutes’ whirl of your egg-beater will give you the méringue.
Beat in the powdered sugar with a few more, and when you have poured
the stewed fruit (or vegetable) into a glass bowl, pile the méringue
(the “fool”?) on the top.


COFFEE AND CAKE

Can be handed with, or after the sweets.
