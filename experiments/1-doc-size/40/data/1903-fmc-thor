tions in Carthage, where he had acted as body-servant, 
foreman, and often as a trusted friend. 
He was certainly not an accomplished valet, but 
Malipieri did not care for that. He was sober, he 
was honest, he was trustworthy, he was cool in danger, 
and he was very strong. Moreover, he was an excel- 
lent and experienced mason, a fact of little or no use 
in the scientific treatment of shoes, trousers, silk hats, 
hair-brushes and coffee, but which had more than once 
been valuable to Malipieri during the last few years. 
Finally, his gratitude to the man who had believed in 
his innocence was deep and lasting. Masin would 
really have given his life to save Malipieri's, and would 
have been glad to give it. 
He set the lamp down on the table, and waited for 
orders, his blue eyes quietly fixed on his master, 
" I never saw that gentleman before," said Malipieri, 
setting some papers in order, under the bright light, 
but still standing. "Did you look at his face?" 
" Yes, sir," answered Masin, and waited. 
" What sort of man should you take him to be ? " 
" A spy, sir," replied Masin promptly. 
" I think you are right," Malipieri answered. " We 
will begin work to-morrow morning." 
"Yes, sir." 
Malipieri ate his supper without noticing what 
Masin brought him, and then installed himself with 
his shaded lamp at his work-table. He took from the 
drawer a number of sketches of plans and studied them 
attentively, by a rather odd process. 
 
He had drawn only one plan on heavy paper, in 
strong black lines. An architect would have seen at 
once that it represented a part of the foundations of 
a very large building ; and two or three persons then 
living in Kome might have recognized the plan of the 
cellars under the north-west corner of the Palazzo 
Conti â€” certainly not more than two or three, one of 
whom was the snviffy expert who had come from be- 
yond the Tiber, and another was Baron Volterra.
