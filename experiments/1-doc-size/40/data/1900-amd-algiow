for a few days and keep them out of the clutches of the young men? You
will have your hands full. But I am needed at home, and I feel that we
must go. So after breakfast we will gather up the small fry. Charles,
have you seen enough of Washington?"
"Not half enough, but I'll come back some time. And I think I'll be a
senator."
"What--not President!"
"I should have to be Vice President first," he returned gravely, at
which they all laughed.
"I do not see why you should hurry!" exclaimed Jane. "The house is
large enough for you all."
"There's a storm brewing, for one thing, and it's a busy season. Then
we do not desire to drive you into insanity."
"My brains are on a more solid foundation than that would imply,"
retorted Jane.
There was quite a confusion when they rose. The squire was always in a
hurry when any arrangement was settled upon. And since Jane was like an
elder sister to the girls----
"You will have to keep them over to next week," he began. "I shall not
be able to get away before--well, the very last. You might let them
spend a day or two with the Carringtons."
"Oh, we shall get along all right, never fear!"
"They're only children, you know," and the squire knit his brow over
a phase of fatherhood he could not make plain to himself, much less
explain to another. "I had an idea Catharine would sober Jaqueline down
a little, being a clergyman's wife and all that, but she's just as much
of a child as ever."
"Oh, you need not feel worried about Jaqueline. And it will be very
nice for them both to see the President and Mr. Jefferson, who is sure
to be there. Everybody is rushing to do them honor. I wish you could
stay."
"I've seen them both many a time, Jane, and every other President. Your
father is right in one thing, Washington was a grand man. There--do
not let the girls run wild."
Annis scarcely let her mother out of her sight. Mrs. Jettson kissed
her and said she was a nice little thing and must come again. Charles
was enthusiastic over his good time, and had much to talk about on the
homeward journey.
"You have used your eyes to some purpose," said his mother with smiling
commendation.
