"Don't do that, Billy," smiled Siward. "You 
haven't discoursed upon art, literature, and science yet, 
and you can't go until you've adjusted the affairs of 
the nation for the next twenty-four hours." 
" Art.? " yawned Fleetwood. " Oh, pictures.' Don't

tainly grown thinner since Fleetwood had last seen him. 
Plank, too, had been shocked at the change in him —
