I shall shoot very steadily this afternoon," he said, 
turning toward the group at luncheon under the trees. 
" I wish Quarrier well — with the cup." 

" Nonsense," said Marion Page curtly ; " you are 
the cleanest shot I ever knew." And she raised her glass 
to him, frankly, and emptied it with the precision char- 
acteristic of her : " Your cup ! With all my heart ! " 

" I also drink to your success, Mr. Siward," said 
Sylvia in a low voice, lifting her champagne glass in the 
sunlight. " To the Shotover Cup — if you wish it." 
And as other glasses sparkled aloft amid a gay tumult 
of voices wishing him success, Sylvia dropped her voice, 
attuning it to his ear alone : " Success for the cup, if 
you wish it — or, whatever you wish — success ! " and she 
meant it very kindly. 

His hand resting on his glass he sat, smiling silent 
acknowledgment to the noisy generous toasts ; he turned 
and looked at Sylvia when her low voice caught his ear — 
looked at her very steadily, unsmiling. 

Then to the others, brightening again, he said a 
word or two, wittily, with a gay compliment well placed 
and a phrase to end it in good taste. And, in the little 
gust of hand-clapping and laughter, he turned again to 
Sylvia, smilingly, sajang under his breath : " As though 
winning the cup could compensate me now for los- 
ing it ! " 

She leaned involuntarily nearer : " You mean that 
you will not try for it? " 

" Yes."
