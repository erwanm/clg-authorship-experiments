but in the way of patience. Self command 
was making her worth twice as much as she 
ever had been in her life before. Matilda 
constantly did what she would rather not, and 
did it well. She sewed when she would have 
liked to do something else ; she studied when 
she was tired; she obeyed commands that 
were hateful to her; she endured from her 
aunt what her child's heart regarded as unspeakable indignities and disagreeablenesses ; 
and she bore them, she was forced to bear 
them, without a murmur; without a sign of 
what she felt. More than that. Since her 
last recorded talk with Mr. Richmond Matilda 
 
had been striving to bear and to do without 
anger or impatience; she had prayed a great 
deal about it; and now it was getting to be 
a matter of course to oppose gentleness and 
a meek heart to all the trials that came upon 
her. In proportion as this was true, they 
grew easier to bear ; far less hard and heavy ; 
the sting seemed to be going out of them. 
Nevertheless the struggle and the sorrow and 
the confinement made the child's face grow 
thin and pale. Mrs. Candy said it was the 
hot weather. 
July and August passed in this manner ; 
and then September. This last month was 
the hardest of all; for Mr. Richmond was 
away from Shadywalk, on some business 
which kept him nearly all the month. 
Towards the end of it, Matilda coming back 
one afternoon from doing an errand, was met 
suddenly near the corner by Norton Laval. 
" Matilda ! " he exclaimed seizing both her 
hands. " Now I have got you. Where have 
you been ? " 
" Nowhere." 
" What have you been doing? " 
" A great many things, Norton."
