down stairs, calling from balconies and terraces ; some 
never ready, and some waiting below in the sun; the 
whole house in a tumult, drivers in a worry, and the 
sleepy animals now and then joining in the clatter with 
a vocal performance that is neither a trumpet-call nor a 
steam-whistle, but an indescribable noise, that begins in 
agony, and abruptly breaks down in despair. It is diffi- 
cult to get the train in motion. The lady who ordered 
Succarina has got a strange donkey, and Macaroni has 
on the wrong saddle. Succarina is a f.ivorite, the kind- 
est, easiest, and surest-footed of beasts, â€” a diminutive 
animal, not bigger than a Friesland sheep ; old, in fact 
grizzly with years, and not unlike the aged, wizened 
little women who are so common here : for beauty in 
this region dries up ; and these handsome Sorrento girls, 
if they live, and almost everybody does live, have the 
prospect, in their old ae, of becoming mummies, with 
parchment skins. I have heard of climates that preserve 
female beauty ; this embalms it, only the beauty escapes 
in the process. As I was saying, Succarina is little, old, 
 





and grizzly ; but her head is large, and one might be 
contented to be as wise as she looks.

through the narrow streets. Donkey-riding is very good 
for people who think they cannot walk. It looks very 
much like riding, to a spectator ; and it deceives the 
person undertaking it into an amount of exercise equal 
to walking. I have a great admiration for the donkey 
character. There never was such patience under wrong 
treatment, such return of devotion for injury. Their 
obstinacy, which is so much talked about, is only an 
exercise of the right of private judgment, and an intel- 
ligent exercise of it, no doubt, if we could take the don-
