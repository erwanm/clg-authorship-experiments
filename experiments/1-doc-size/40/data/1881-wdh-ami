which women fall who brood long upon opposing 
purposes and desires. She wished to be reconciled, and 
she wished to be revenged, and she recurred to either 
wish for the time as vehemently as if the other did

will find us both a great deal changed. Flavia looks 
so much older, and so do I. But I shall soon show 
him that I can look young again. I presume he 's 
changed too." 

Marcia held the little girl up at the window. They 
had now left the river hills and the rolling country 
beyond, and had entered the great plain which 
stretches from the Ohio to the Mississippi ; and mile 
by mile, as they ran southward and westward, the 
spring unfolded in the mellow air under the dull, 
warm sun. The willows were in perfect leaf, and

boughs ; the may-apples had already pitched their 
tents in the woods, beginning to thicken and darken 
with the young foliage of the oaks and hickories ;

the peach orchards flushed pink beside the brick 
farmsteads. The child gave a cry of delight, and 



 

pointed ; and her mother seemed to forget all that had 
gone before, and abandoned herself to Flavia 's joy in 
the blossoms, as if there were no trouble for her in the 
world.
