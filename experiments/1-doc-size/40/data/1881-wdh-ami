the sinuous line was broken by a convulsive twitch 
ing. " Perhaps," he resumed with the utmost gentle 
ness, "the plaintiff returned in this interval, and, 
finding her gone, was confirmed in his belief that she 
had abandoned him." 
He felt blindly about on the table with his 
trembling hands, and his whole figure had a pathos 
that gave the old dress-coat statuesque dignity. 
The spectators quietly changed their places, and 
 
occupied the benches near him, till Bartley was left 
sitting alone with his counsel. We are beginning to 
talk here at the East of the decline of oratory ; but it 
is still a passion in the West, and his listeners now 
clustered about the Squire in keen appreciation of his 
power ; it seemed to summon even the loiterers in the 
street, whose ascending tramp on the stairs continu 
ally made itself heard ; the lawyers, the officers of 
the court, the judge, forgot their dinner, and posed 
themselves anew in their chairs to listen. 
No doubt the electrical sphere of sympathy and 
admiration penetrated to the old man 's consciousness. 
When he pulled off his black satin stock the relic 
of ancient fashion which the piety of his daughter 
kept in repair and laid it on the table, there was a 
deep inarticulate murmur of satisfaction which he 
could not have mistaken. His voice rose again : 
" If the plaintiff indeed came at that time, the 
walls of those empty rooms, into which he peered like 
a thief in the night, might have told him if walls 
had tongues to speak as they have ears to hear a 
tale that would have melted even his heart with 
remorse and shame. They might have told him of a 
woman waiting in hunger and cold for his return, and 
willing to starve and freeze, rather than own herself 
forsaken, waiting till she was hunted from her 
door by the creditors whom he had defrauded, and 
forced to confess her disgrace and her despair, in order 
to save herself from the unknown terrors of the law, 
invoked upon her innocent head by his villany.
