scrub the floors for you," he said. 
" We have 'em scrubbed in the early morning," 
replied the man. 
" Well, let me come and do it," said Samuel. 
" Go on! " said the other. " You'll be ready 
for more feed then." 
" I'll come, just the same, sir." 
" If you take my advice," the bartender ob- 
served, " you'll get out of this town. Lockman- 
ville's a poor place to hunt jobs in." 
Samuel started. " Lockmanville! " he gasped. 
" Yes," said the other. " Don't you know 
where you are? " 
" I didn't know," said the boy. " Lockman- 
ville! The one where the big glass works are? " 
" That's the one." 
" And where old Henry Lockman lived! " 
" What about it? " asked the other. 
" Nothing," said Samuel, " only my father in- 
vested all his money in Lockman's company, and 
lost it." 
" Gee! " said the bartender. 
" Maybe if I told them," said the boy, " they'd 
give me some work here." 
" Maybe," said the other — "only the works is 
shut down." 
" Shut down! " cried Samuel; and then added, 
" On account of his death? " 
" No — they always close in summer. But this 
year they closed in March. Times is bad." 
" Oh," said Samuel. 
" So there's plenty of men looking for jobs in 
Lockmanville," the other continued, " an' some 
of the other factories is closed, too — the cotton 
mill is only runnin' half time." 
" I see." 
" Old Lockman used to say there was too many 
glass works," the barkeeper added. " An' the 
fevers he bought out went an' built more. So 
there you are."
