" I will not listen," she cries, sharply ; and before he is 
aware, she is flying up the path, and disappears in the 
wide doorway. To be rebuffed, in any manner, by a 
woman, is so new an experience to Ward AUaire, that his 
breath comes in gasps, as if he had been struck a physical 
blow. Anger succeeds the surprise. He opens the gate 
and wends his way briskly to the station. 

Christmas gains her room, slips the bolt on the door,

in studying the becomingness of a gown, or considering 
Just the shade of manner to be used toward the people 
who shall fill her drawing-room in the evening ; can she
