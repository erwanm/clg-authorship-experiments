Miss Ormiston has not meant to go at all. She has had 
a curious presentiment that something would intervene ; 
but she is well, and there is no earthly reason that she 
can make plausible to Dolly. She has not answered her 
yet, when in the mail sent up one morning there is a 
note that fills her with wildest dismay, a brief line from 
Jeffries, simply pointing out that he has requested Mr. 
St. George to see her upon a matter that concerns him, 
in which she will use her efforts to restore him to liberty 
at once. 

Christmas Ormiston sits like a statue, stunned with the 
task still before her. She has not even moved when Mr. 
St. Oeorge is announced. There is an aspect of resolu- 
tion in his face, that bodes ill for concealment or any 
sentimental pity. His eyes will be clear to cut through 
any weak subterfuge. 

The greeting is cordial but brief. That he is greatly 
disturbed is evident. 

"Miss Ormiston," he begins, " that you are not igno- 
rant of a base and impudent forgery upon Ormiston Mills, 
Mr. Donaldson has informed me. He wrote to me imme- 
diately, and learning that Jeffries or Carew, whichever 
may be his true name, was in New York, I had him ar- 
rested. He is now in prison and will be held to answer 
for the charge." 

There is a constriction in her throat, and her lips deny 
the words that seem to plead for him. 

" There can be no good reason for refusing to prose- 
cute " ; and his eyes seem to study every line of her face*
