for he was in no hurry to anticipate what he feared would be an
unpleasant interview.
"Where is Mrs. Oakley, Jane?" he asked of a servant whom he met in the
hall.
"She's in the sitting-room, Master John," said Jane. "She wants to see
you immediately."
"Very well; I'll go in."
He heard steps behind him, and, turning, found that Ben was following
him.
"He wants to hear me scolded," thought John. "However, I won't take any
notice."
Mrs. Oakley was sitting in a rocking-chair. She looked up with a frown
as John entered. She had never liked him, but since Ben had declared,
falsely, as we know, that John had no more respect for her than a
servant, this dislike was greatly increased.
[Illustration] She was inwardly determined to make his life as
uncomfortable as possible.
"Well, sir," she said, "so you have come at last."
"I came as soon as Ben told me you wished to see me," said John. "I
only waited till I had put my horse into the stable."
"His horse!" repeated Ben, by way of calling his mother's attention
to the claim to ownership expressed in those words.
"I suppose I ought to consider it lucky that you paid any attention to
my words," said Mrs. Oakley.
"I hope I have not failed in proper respect," said John.
"It was very respectful in you to ride off with the horse, when I had
told Ben he might use it."
"It was my horse," said John, firmly. "If Ben wanted it, he might ask
me."
"Ask you, indeed!" repeated Ben, scornfully; "you won't catch me doing
that."
"It was enough that I told him that he might ride. Didn't he tell you
that?"
"Yes."
"Then what right had you to refuse?"
"The horse is mine," said John. "It was given me by my father."
"He allowed you to use it."
"He gave it to me. At the same time he gave Ben a watch, which he is
wearing now. He has no more right to demand my horse than I have to
claim his watch."
