There is no struggle in the Huguenot's mind." 

"Do you never have struggles?" said Olive sud 
denly. But Mr. Iredell answered with impenetra 
ble calmness, 

" I have had them." 

" Which sort ? " 

He smiled at her in a little wonder. "I have 



 

never had an Eve of St. Bartholomew to try me/ 
he said. 

" I know ! " said Olive. "You would do exactly 
like that man, and refuse life for a punctilio." But 
there was a little red spot on each of her cheeks, 
which I wondered much to see there. Mr. Iredell 
made no answer, and as we rose to go up stairs, he 
went to the library. In Olive's room I threw my 
self down before the pictures, to study and compare. Olive took no part. I had a feeling that 
she was looking at me. 

"Well," said she at last; "what do you see 
there ? " 

"All Mr. Iredell said. They are beautiful in 
their different ways of telling the story. There is 
no struggle in the Huguenot's face; it is sad, but 
H is lofty and sweet; there is almost a smile. And 
the Black Brunswicker's brow is all knotted with 
pain." 

"He is going, though," said Olive. "There is 
no more struggle in this than in the other one."
