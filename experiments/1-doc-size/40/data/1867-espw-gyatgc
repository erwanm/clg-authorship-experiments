lost the place. Oh, no ! 
" * Her head was unadorned, save by a single 
iiamond, in a wreath of artificial roses Let 
me see" and that was the end of the con 
jugations. 
" Jane dear," observed Gypsy, languidly, 
looking up from the amiable Lorina when 
study-hours were half over, " I don't see what 
you are always studying for." 
Silent study-hours were the rule, and Jane 
made no reply. 
" Oh, I forgot," said Gypsy ; " well, I won't 
talk. I 'm going to study when I get through 
this chapter." 
" This chapter " lasted till the bell rang to go 
to walk. Gypsy, flushed and excited, threw 
the book angrily down, but made no remarks. 
" Why don't you come to bed? " asked Jane 
that night, after the lamp was out. Gypsy was 
sitting by the window in her night-dress. She 
sat there some time; and there the following 
conversation took place. 
" I was a little villain, that 's what I was ! I 
won't do it again. But I think it 's dreadfully 
poky work studying." 
" What did you come to the Golden Crescent 
for, dear? " 
" Oh, well I know it ; but I can't be an ex 
emplary scholar now, like Jane there, mother. 
Why, just think, she not only learns her lessons 
perfectly; but she actually reads somebody 
else 's Roman History in connection with our little 
black one, TO IMPROVE HER MIND ! " 
" When Jane is out of school, she will know 
something to pay for it. And some day, you 
will be sorry that you have not been more like 
her, Gypsy." 
" My dear, respected mother, I beg your 
pardon, but I don't believe it! I won't be a 
dunce, but I can't be a model."
