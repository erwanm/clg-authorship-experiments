her, " when you see a novel I brought from 
home on purpose for you to read. It 's The 
Shadow of a Life-time, most elegant story, 
and so weird, you 've no idea." 

To her justice, be it recorded that Gypsy 
did study in the morning till the history lesson 
was learned. When afternoon came, however, 
and she was sleepy, and the room was hot, and 



"The Shadow of a Life-time " lay, in tempting 
brown binding and beautiful print, open upon 
the table, she thought that she would just look it 
over, see the heroine 's name, and how it ended, be 
fore commencing on those dreary conjugations, 

" Over the little one 's future all unknown fo 
thee, innocent one, a Shadow hung  why, Jane, 
this looks interesting. Oh, what 's this pic 
ture? Lorina found by her Lovers Dear 
me ! what a lot of em she had ! Oh, here 's a 
description of a ball-dress. I think descrip 
tions of ball-dresses are splendid. There, I ve 
lost the place. Oh, no ! 

" * Her head was unadorned, save by a single 
iiamond, in a wreath of artificial roses Let 
me see" and that was the end of the con 
jugations. 

" Jane dear," observed Gypsy, languidly, 
looking up from the amiable Lorina when 
study-hours were half over, " I don't see what 
you are always studying for." 

Silent study-hours were the rule, and Jane 
made no reply.
