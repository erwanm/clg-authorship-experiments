HE was, however, by no means so much in earnest 
as this might seem to indicate ; and, indeed, he was 
more than anything else amused with the whole sit-

drama it was of which Mrs. Penniman desired to 
represent the ingenious Mr. Townsend as the hero. 
He had no intention, as yet, of regulating the denoue

suggested, to give the young man the benefit of ev-

if a penniless swain who could give a good account 
of himself should enter the lists, he should be judged 
quite upon his personal merits. There were other 
things besides. The Doctor thought it very vulgar
