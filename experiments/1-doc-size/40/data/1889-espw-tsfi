on an axis, and movement in an orbit and 
movement in a spiral ; in short, that oscillation 
is not a simple affair of two strokes. The 
vibration may start where it is not expected. 
The pulsation may hit athwart where logic was 
not great enough to look for it. This is pre- 
cisely what has happened. 
< If any of the priests and prophets of the

would have been incarcerated in an institu- 
tion offering all the modern improvements 
in alienism, had she foretold a vibration of 
thought like that of which this fact is the 
sonometer. 
The burliest positivist is not more puzzled 
at the present growth among us of the psy-
