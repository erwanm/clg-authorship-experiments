efficient, ready for any labor of love, stands Wilfred 
Joslyn. His sisters are married and gone from home. 
He- and his mother are alone, will always be, save when the 
daughters come home, bringing their children. It will be a 
pleasant place for them, and in any want or distress an 
abiding shelter. He is a great favorite. His horses and 
carriage, and himself, are at the service of the ladies, and 
those a little passee, or not abounding in this world's goods, 
welcome his coming with a frank smile. They can depend 
on his kind heart for many attentions. But no one counts 
on marrying him. He shows so plainly in every act, 
every word, that he has settled himself in the groove 



 

where he is to bide all the days of his mortal life. No ono 
fancies that he has been disappointed. But the sun rose over 
him once. He is content with that morning, though glow- 
ing midnoon and ripe fragrant evening must come to him 
only in dreams. But he does not go at once to the night 
and darkness. 

He knows Mrs. Auchester has come home, richer by two 
children than when she went away. When she visits Roth-

way, to call upon her; his mother was always fond of 
Lily Bertrand. If, somewhere in a quiet nook, he should 
come across her children, straying off with the free daring 
of babyhood, he may, unperceived, give them the kiss he 
dared not give their mother, for the sake of the dreamland 
children who are never to grow up around his fireside. He 
does not blame Lily. He would much rather have her 
memory to halo his path, than any other woman's love. Of 
the many things she has said and done, he recalls one poem 
she repeated in the shady woods something about sweet 
white brow, lips of geranium red, and the hair's young gold. 
Two lines are all he can remember consecutively :
