CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE MINING STOCK IS SOLD.


"BUT I understood that you were poor," said Mr. Rockwell, surprised at
Mark's statement.

"That we are so is because Mr. Talbot as executor has concealed from my
mother the existence of the stock as a part of grandfather's estate."

"How long since your grandfather died?"

"Nearly two years."

"And the stock is only now to be sold?"

"Yes; my uncle had advices that it would be well to wait, as it was
likely to go up."

"And your mother's share is half--say, two hundred shares?"

"Yes, sir."

"Then she will be comfortable for life. At the price I am thinking of
paying, this will amount to over fifty thousand dollars. Now can you
give me any information about the mine?"

"Yes, sir; I made it my business to inquire. It is confidently expected
to go considerably higher. It is growing richer every day."

"I shall rely upon your statements and buy the stock. After it is sold I
advise you to take immediate steps to secure your share. Have you
consulted a lawyer?"
