did not escape the notice of the little brown, 
pinched face in the firelight, for it was curving 
into a bitter smile when the door opened, banging 
back against the wall as if the opener had 
either little consciousness or little care of the 
noise it made. 

" There 's Catty," said Sip, doggedly. " Come 
and get warm, Catty." This in their silent 
language on her rapid, work-worn fingers. 

"If you mind me now, I'll go," said Miss 
Kelso, in a low voice. 

" That 's for you to say, whether I shall mind 
you now." 

" Poor Catty ! " said Perley, still in a very low 
voice. " Poor, poor Catty ! " 

Sip flushed, â€” flushed very sweetly and sud- 
denly all over her dogged face. "Now I don't 
mind you. Stay to supper. We'll have supper 
right away. Come here a minute. Catty dear." 

Catty dear would not come. Catty dear stood 
scowling in the middle pf the room, a sullen, ill- 
tempered, ill-controlled, uncontrollable Catty dear 
as one could ask to see. 





"For love's sake," said Sip, on her patient 
fingers ; "here a minute, for love's sake. Catty." 

" For love's sake ? " repeated Catty, in her 
pathetic language.
