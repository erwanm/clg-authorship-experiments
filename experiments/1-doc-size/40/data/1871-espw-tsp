doomed by sunlight, starlight, moonlight, 
twilight, in crowds and in hush, from year unto 
year, to struggle towards each other, — vain 
builders of a vain bridge across the fixed gulf of an 
irreparable lot, — a weariness of sympathy, which 
wellnigh extinguished the artistic fineness of the 
chance? Something of this feeling would have 
struck a keen observer of Miss Kelso and the 
little girl in plaid. 
Their eyes had met, when the girl lifted her 
arms to tie on her hat. Against the burning 
globes of the druggist's window, which quivered 
and swam through the sheen of the fall of sleet, 
and just where the perfect prism broke about 
her, she made a miserably meagre figure. Miss 
Kelso, from the soft dry gloom of her carriage 
door, leaned out resplendent. 
The girl's lips moved angrily, and she said 
something in a sharp voice which the wind must 
have carried the other way, for the druggist 
heard it, and sent a clerk out to order her off. 
Miss Kelso, obeying one of her whimsical
impulses, — who had a better right, indeed, to be 
whimsical  — beckoned to the girl, who, after 
swearing a little at the druggist's clerk, strode 
up rather roughly to the carriage. 
" What do you want of me ? and what were 
you staring at ? Didn't you ever see anybody 
lose his hat in a sleet-storm before ? " 
" I beg your pardon," said Miss Kelso ; " I did 
not mean to be rude.'' 
She spoke on the instinct of a lady. She was 
nothing of a philanthropist, not much of a 
Christian. Let us be honest, even if inbred sin 
and courtesy, not justification by faith, and
conscience, induced this rather remarkable reply. I 
call it remarkable, from the standpoint of girls in 
plaid. That particular girl, without doubt, found 
it so. She raised her eyes quickly and keenly to 
the young lady's face.
