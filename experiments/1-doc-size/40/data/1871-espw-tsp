" Your own mills are your own affairs," interrupted
Sip. " You 'd better find out for yourself. 
It ain't to complain to you that I talk to you." 

They had come now quite into the town, and 
stopped, at the parting of their several ways. 
Miss Kelso held out her hand to the girl, with 
a troubled face. The mills were making a 
great noise and confused her, and she felt that 
it was of little use to say anything further than 
that she should try to come and see Catty, and 
that she thanked her for â€” but she was sure that 
she did not know for what, and so left the
sentence unfinished, and bade her good morning 
instead. 





Sip Garth stood still in a snow-drift, and 
rubbed her hands, which had grown pink and 
warm. Her brown little face was puzzled. 

" It wasn't all the sun, nor yet the touch. 
It was the newness, I think," she said. 

She said it again to Catty, when she got home 
with the dock-weed. 

" Eh ! " said Catty. She made a little harsh 
sound like a croak. 

" O, no matter," said Sip, talking upon her 
fingers, " you couldn't understand ! But I think 
it must have been the newness."
