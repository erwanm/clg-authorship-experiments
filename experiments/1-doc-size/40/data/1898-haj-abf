"He has sent an acceptance."

"And you mean to have Miss Beaufort there to play dancing-tunes?"

"Yes; she comes a good deal cheaper than a professional," said Mrs.
Tilton, who, even in her pleasures, was thrifty.

"That is well. Then you will have an opportunity to see how the two
go on together, and can quietly signify to Miss Beaufort, the next
day, your opinion of her conduct."

"But, Arethusa," said Mrs. Tilton, who was not jealous, like her
niece, "I can't think there is anything out of the way. Miss
Beaufort has always seemed to me a model of propriety."

"Oh, you dear, unsuspicious aunt! How easily you are deceived! Do
you want to know my opinion of Miss Propriety--the opinion I formed
when I first saw her?"

"Well, Arethusa?"

"I saw at once that she was bold and sly, and I really think it
is taking a great risk to permit your children to be under the
instruction of such a girl."

"Well, Arethusa, I will take your advice and watch them both at the
party."

"That is all I ask, Aunt Lucy."

"I will get aunt to discharge her yet," said Miss Jayne to herself,
with satisfied malice.
