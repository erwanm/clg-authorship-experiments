suppose----"
"It is too far away from her old friends for any of them to come, and I
am sure Lilian would like it as simple and quiet as possible. I should
say tomorrow morning. No one will go out of curiosity."
"Then I will see about it at once. The Major is all impatience to have
his daughter."
"You must come and share my room," Mrs. Barrington said to Lilian.
"Oh, she really doesn't seem any different to me," the girl returned.
"She has slept so much the last few days, and it is what we have

will not feel hurt if he sometimes should show a little--" he paused
with a flush. "For after all it might have been her child who was
saved----" and she felt the shiver go over him.
"And to know that you were loved all these years," said the mother
holding out her arms, and both children went to them. "And that you
never really suffered for anything. Sometimes I hardly dare believe in
and accept this great blessing."
"Oh, I hope I will prove a blessing," Lilian said, with a great tremble
in her voice. "You are so good to take me in, to love and trust me,
