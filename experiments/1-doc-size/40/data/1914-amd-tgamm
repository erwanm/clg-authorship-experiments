"I was out," began Lilian, tremulously. "She insisted that I should go
and seemed to want to be alone. I staid longer than I meant, and found
her fallen to the floor--"

Mrs. Boyd raised to a partly sitting posture and looked up with feverish
eagerness.

"I went to put something in the chiffonier--you will find it, Lilian, in
a box and the key is--oh, what did I do with it?"

"Never mind, dear," in a soft tone.

"But you must mind, and then I turned--it was my leg. It is heavy and
I can't raise it, but the ache is all gone."

Dr. Kendricks turned down the blanket and examined the limb, nodding as
if convinced.

"Oh," she cried, "is it paralysis? Then it will not be long. My mother
had two strokes a week apart, her mother never rallied from the first.
I'm tired--worn out, and Lilian will be better off without me. She may
find--I have written it all out--it's there in the drawer--"

"Oh mother!" Lilian kissed her and put her back on the pillow where she
gave a gasping sigh.

Dr. Kendricks beckoned Mrs. Barrington out of the room.

"She is in a very low condition and I doubt if she survives more than a
few days. What about the girl--is it her daughter?"

"Why, yes--though they are very dissimilar; but she is a devoted
daughter. The mother is caretaker, the daughter a student."

"She seems to have exhausted nature. The fainting spells may be a method
of rest. Let her sleep all she can. Very little can be done for her. I
will leave some drops to be given if she is very restless and will look
in in the morning. It is rather unfortunate this should happen to you,
just now."
