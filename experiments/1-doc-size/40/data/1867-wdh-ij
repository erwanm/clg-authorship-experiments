or more intelligently understood our reverent curi- 
osity. It was the new burial-ground which we had 
entered, and which is a little to the right of the elder 
cemetery. It was very beautiful and tasteful in every 
way ; the names upon the stones were chiefly Eng- 
lish and Scotch, with here and there an American's. 
But affection drew us only to the prostrate tablet in- 
scribed with the words, " Percy Bysshe Shelley, Cor

and grander monument which some members of the 
Keats family were to place over the dust of their 
great kinsman. But, for one, I hope this may never 
be done, even though the original stone should also 
be left there, as was intended. Let the world still
