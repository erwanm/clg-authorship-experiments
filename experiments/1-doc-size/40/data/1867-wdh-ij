died away, when our adventure acquired an idyllic 
flavor from the appearance on the scene of four peas- 
ants in an ox-cart. These the conductor tried to en- 
gage to bring out the baggage and right the fallen 
diligence ; and they, after making him a little speech 
upon the value of their health, which might be in- 
jured, asked him, tentatively, two hundred francs 
for the service. The simple incident enforced the 
fact already known to us, that, if Italians some- 
times take advantage of strangers, they are equally 
willing to prey upon each other ; but I doubt if any 
thing could have taught a foreigner the sweetness 
with which our conductor bore the enormity, and 
turned quietly from those brigands to carry the Port- 
land man from the wreck, on which he lingered, to 
the shore. 

Here in the gathering twilight the passengers of 
both diligences grouped themselves, and made merry 
over the common disaster. As the conductor and 
the drivers brought off the luggage our spirits rose 
with the arrival of each trunk, and we were pleased 
or not as we found it soaked or dry. We applauded 
and admired the greater sufferers among us : a lady 
who opened a dripping box was felt to have perpe- 
trated a pleasantry; and a Brazilian gentleman, 
whose luggage dropped to pieces and was scattered 
in the flood about the diligence, was looked upon as 
a very subtile humorist. Our own contribution to 
these witty passages was the epigrammatic display 
of a reeking trunk full of the pretty rubbish people 
bring away from Rome and Naples, copies of Pom- 



 

peian frescos more ruinous than the originals ; photo- 
graphs floating loose from their cards ; little earthen 
busts reduced to the lumpishness of common clay ;
