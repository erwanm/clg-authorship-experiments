proof that he had been under-paid. On that con- 
fronted and defeated, he thanked us very cordially, 
gave us the number of his brougham, and begged us 
to ask for him when we came next to Padua and 
needed a carriage. 
From the Chapel of the Annunziata he drove us 
to the Church of Santa Giustina, where is a very 
famous and noble picture by Romanino. But as this 
writing has nothing in the world to do with art, I here 
dismiss that subject, and with a gross and idle delight 
follow the sacristan down under the church to the 
prison of Santa Giustina. 
Of all the faculties of the mind there is none so 
little fatiguing to exercise as mere wonder ; and, for 
my own sake, I try always to wonder at things with- 
out the least critical reservation. I therefore, in the 
 
sense of deglutition, bolted this prison at once, 
though subsequent experiences led me to look with 
grave indigestion upon the whole idea of prisons, 
their authenticity, and even their existence. 
As far as mere dimensions are concerned, the 
prison of Santa Giustina was not a hard one to swal-

and a long-suffering prince, whom, singularly enough, 
no historic artist has yet arisen to whitewash), and 
was then brought out into the larger cell adjoining, 
to suffer a blessed martyrdom. I am not sure now 
whether the sacristan said she was dashed to death 
on the stones, or cut to pieces with knives ; but 
whatever the form of martyrdom, an iron ring in the

and just under the grating, through which the sacris- 
tan thrust his candle to illuminate it, was a mountain 
of candle-drippings, a monument to the fact that 
faith still largely exists in this doubting world. My
