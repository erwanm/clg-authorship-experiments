" Never mind," said his mamma softly. " Let me tell 
you a Christmas story." 

For once Aunt Adelaide took the start of them, and 
gained her point. The doctor coincided with her, that it 
would be quite absurd. Nelly said no more ; and yet, 
from her heart, she pitied any children condemned to 
such a dreary holiday. Once she had half a mind to 
stay at home. 

" Nonsense ! " said the doctor peremptorily. 

She went on Saturday, and had a lovely Christmas 
Sunday, a preparation for the higher feast. How good 
it was to enjoy herself with the dear home-circle once 
more ! Then, when they returned from the Christmas 
morning services, they found Dr. Kinnard ready to take 
dinner with them. 

" But I must go back this evening," he said. " I have 
two quite critical cases on hand. However, it shall not 
spoil your holidays. You deserve a good long one, little 
woman, though Mary gave me private instructions to 
bring you home with me." 

Nelly only smiled then ; but some curious presentiment 
decided her to return. They had the tree just at dusk ; 
and no one was more delighted with his remembrances 
than the doctor, who kissed his rosy sisters-in-law all 





round, and declared that they were enough to spoil any 
man. 

Nelly came down presently, warmly wrapped in her 
furs.
