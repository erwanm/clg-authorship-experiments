bowed down on her knees ; so of course she hadn't 
seen the performance, and thought her child was 
clean gone with the man. She was nearly a half a 
mile from her people, so we thought we might go 
down to the child, which was about a quarter of a 
mile bevond her, and snake it to her before the 
caravan-people could git to us to do us any harm ; 
and, besides, we reckoned they had enough business 
on their hands for one while, anyway, with the 
wounded. We thought we'd chance it, and we did.

chain and hung it around Jim's neck, and hugged 
him again, and jerked up the child again and 
mashed it to her breast, a- sobbing and glorifying 
all the time ; and Jim he shoved for the ladder and 
up it, and in a minute we was back up in the sky, 
and the woman was staring up, with the back of 
her head between her shoulders and the child with 
its arms locked around her neck. And there she 
stood, as long as we was in sight a-sailiug away in 
the sky. 
CHAPTER VII 
' Noon ! ' says Tom, and so it was. His shadder 
was just a blot around his feet. We looked, and 
the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the 
difference didn't amount to nothing. So Tom said 
London was right north of us or right south of us, 
one or t'other, and he reckoned by the weather and 
the sand and the camels it was north ; and a good
