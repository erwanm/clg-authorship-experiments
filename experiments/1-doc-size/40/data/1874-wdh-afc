book and pamphlet, and thus repaid in the only 
way possible the trouble their visit had given, he 
did not offer to take leave of them, but after speak 
ing with Ferris, of whom he seemed an old friend, 
lie led them through the garden environing the con 
vent, to a little pavilion perched on the wall that 
defends the island from the tides of the lagoon. A 
lay-brother presently followed them, bearing a tray 
with coffee, toasted rusk, and a jar of that conserve 
of rose-leaves which is the convent's delicate hospi 
tality to favored guests. Mrs. Vervain cried out 
over the poetic confection when Padre Girolamo 
told her what it was, and her daughter suffered her 
self to express a guarded pleasure. The amiable 
matron brushed the crumbs of the baicolo from her 
lap when the lunch was ended, and fitting on her 
glasses leaned forward for a better look at the 
monk's black-bearded face. " I'm perfectly de 
lighted," she said. " You must be very happy 
here. I suppose you are." 
" Yes," answered the monk rapturously; " so 
happy that I should be content never to leave San 
Lazzaro. I came here when I was very young, and 
the greater part of my life has been passed on this 
little island. It is my home my country." 
" Do you never go away ?" 
" Oh yes ; sometimes to Constantinople, some 
times to London and Paris." 
"And you've never been to America yet ? Well 
now, I'll tell you ; you ought to go. You would 
like it, I know, and our people would give you a 
very cordial reception." 
" Reception ? " The monk appealed once more 
to Ferris with a look. 
Ferris broke into a laugh. " I don 't believe Pa 
dre Girolamo would come in quality of distinguished 
foreigner, Mrs. Vervain, and I don 't think he d 
know what to do with one of our cordial recep 
tions." 
" Well, he ought to go to America, any way.
