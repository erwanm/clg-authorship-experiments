him, and bit the hand that was extended to serve him.

"Mr. Checkynshaw came here, with the constable, and inquired into all
the circumstances attending the finding of the papers," said Maggie,
tired of Mr. Wittleworth's tedious exordium. "He was entirely satisfied
with what we had done."

Maggie then explained the manner in which the papers had come into
Leo's chest; that they were concealed there by "Pilky Wayne."

"Mr. Checkynshaw was very good and very kind," she added, with
enthusiasm.

"Checkynshaw?" exclaimed Fitz, incredulously.

"He was, indeed."

"Checkynshaw don't know how to be good and kind--Checkynshaw don't. It
isn't in him."

"Indeed, he does!" protested Maggie.

"So he does!" chimed in Leo, who was very grateful to Mr. Checkynshaw
for buying his merchandise and recommending it to his friends. "I blow
for Checkynshaw!"

"Mr. Checkynshaw has been very kind to us, and we feel grateful to him
for his goodness," added Andr√©, in his mild, silky-toned voice.

"I know Checkynshaw. I've summered him and wintered him; and you have
to summer and winter a man like Checkynshaw before you know him. My
friend Choate knows him. Me and Choate both know him. Checkynshaw is
mean; Checkynshaw has a small soul. You could set up two such souls as
Checkynshaw's on the point of a cambric needle, and they could wander
about till the end of time without coming within hailing distance of
each other."

"Mr. Checkynshaw is not mean," replied Maggie, her pretty face red with
excitement and indignation.
