am too homesick.... If Helen were here, I could enjoy it.
(He strolls about without aim or interest. Happy spirits pass and
repass.)
Enter a man-spirit of impressive and
commanding appearance. His costume
bears a certain vague resemblance
to the dress of a gentleman and scholar
of the Court of Charles I. of England.
A cloak of the tint of the dead
oak-leaf is clasped across his breast
by a golden cross. He regards DR.
THORNE with a piercing but kindly
look. He speaks with a fine and
courtly manner, dating from a bygone
age.
THE MAN-SPIRIT. I read thee for a stranger here.
DR. THORNE (bitterly). A stranger in a strange place am I, indeed. You
are the first inhabitant of this country who has troubled himself to
speak to me. Thank you for your politeness, sir.
THE MAN-SPIRIT. I was commanded. These (waving his hand toward the
groups of spirits) were not.
DR. THORNE. You look like a person more fitted to give commands than to
receive them. I fail to understand that word--commanded. I am--at
least, I was--a sovereign citizen of America. I was not born or trained
a subject.
THE MAN-SPIRIT (smiling). And I was subject of an English
sovereign--in fact, an officer of the royal court.
DR. THORNE (without smiling). And this nation? Is it an autocratic
monarchy you have here? What is your political system?
THE MAN-SPIRIT. It is a simple one--a pure theocracy.
DR. THORNE (indifferently). Oh, theocracy? That is a system into which
I have never studied. I have been a busy man. I was a
physician-- (Abruptly.) Would you favor me with your name?
THE MAN-SPIRIT. I was a healer of the sick in my time. My name
was-- (Whispers his name.)
DR. THORNE (starts with pleased surprise). The great Harvey? And
you discovered the circulation of the blood? How wonderful! Why, I
thought you had been mould and clover these two hundred and fifty
years! It never occurred to me that you were alive.... What an
extraordinary fact!
