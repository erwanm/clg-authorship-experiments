said Hunter. He looked angry enough and willing to show 
 
it. "I don't seem to care about the way things are going on 
here. If you had the spirit of a rabbit, you 'd get a good girl 
into this house â€” " 
"And have Lyddy hang herself to the bed-post by her 
garters?" 
"Lyddy! I'm sick of Lyddy. What business have you 
got anyway, taking a girl into your house and then working 
her to death to make things go as that old beldame wants 
'cm to ? You 've got to make a change and do it quick, or 
something's going to happen." 
Winterbourne liked him very much in his red-hot anger, 
his brown hands gripping the chair-back he had been put- 
ting straight, and his jaw set firm. Hunter was "mad," as 
school-boys had seen him years ago, and as he hadn't found 
occasion to be since, he had dominated the world so simply 
and it had so obeyed him. But Winterbourne wasn't going 
to give in. After all, it was his kitchen and Bess was his 
chosen kid. He got up from the chair, and yawned a little. 
"All right. Hunter," he agreed. " I 've got to go to bed. 
So 've you. There 's another day coming." 
" I mean it," Dwight assured him. " A man's laziness can 
go too far." 
Winterbourne had opened the door and stood looking out. 
But there was something in the air that made it likely he ex- 
pected Dwight to go, and the youth blunderingly did, feeling 
righteous but somehow crude and foolish. Yet he was awake 
to the injustice of it all. A man like Winterbourne, as clever 
as he, he thought, could make you feel young by just stand- 
ing by and laughing. But he had no business to. He 'd better 
get a capable girl into the kitchen and stop talking about 
Jupiter and Theocritus. Dwight had loved the talk about 
Theocritus until it became apparent that Bess was being 
lashed too hard. That sent Theocritus up in smoke. 
 
" Dwight," Winterbourne called him. 
"Well," said Dwight, pausing in the path. 
" You 're certain you don't consider Celia a lily in a garden 
of spice?"
