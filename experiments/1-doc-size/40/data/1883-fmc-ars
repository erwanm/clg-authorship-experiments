 

But her voice failed her, and she staggered against 
the wall, hiding her face in her hands. A trembling 
breath, a struggle, a great wild sob: the long-sealed 
tears were free, and flowed fast over her hands. 

"Oh, no, no," she moaned, "you must not tell 
him that. " Then choking down her agony she turned 
to me : " You will not you cannot tell him of this ? 
I am weak, ill, but I will bear everything for for 
him." 

The great effort had exhausted her, and I think 
that if I had not caught her she would have fallen, 
and she would have hurt herself very much on the 
stone floor. But she is young, and I am not very 
strong, and could not have held her up. So I knelt, 
letting her weight come on my shoulder. 

The fair head rested pathetically against my old 
coat, and I tried to wipe away her tears with her 
long, golden hair; for I had not any handkerchief. 
But very soon I could not see to do it. I was crying 
myself, for the pity of it all, and my tears trickled 
down and fell on her thin hands. And so I kneeled, 
and she half lay and half sat upon the floor, with her 
head resting on my shoulder. I was glad then to be 
old, for I felt that I had a right to comfort her. 

Presently she looked up into my face, and saw that 
I was weeping. She did not speak, but found her 
little lace handkerchief, and pressed it to my eyes, 
first to one, and then to the other; and the action 
brought a faint maidenly flush to her cheeks through 
all her own sorrow. A daughter could not have done 
it more kindly.
