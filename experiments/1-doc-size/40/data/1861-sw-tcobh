as if I was sure ; and I wasn’t. And just 
now I said I knew all about the little 
travellers; but, oh, I know so little! I 
spoke too fast to speak quite true.” 
Then thought Debby to herself, “ I 
guess that’s what mother meant by walking in the truth. ” “Well, what do you know 
about ’em, Jane?” she said aloud. “ Because I know a good deal, and I can tell 
you.” 
“Do you?” said Jane, putting her hand 
in Debby’s. “Then I wish you would tell 
me. You know, Debby, the Bible says 
we ought to walk even as Jesus walked; 
and sometimes it seems to me as if I walked 
just the other way. Do you ever feel so ? 
Now, if I loved Jesus as he loves me, I 
think my heart would run to him all the 
time.” 
Debby was puzzled in her turn. Here 
was something about little travellers which 
went quite beyond her knowledge. 
“Do you love Jesus?” she said, looking 
out from under her sunbonnet. 
“Oh, yes!” Jane answered: “we all do 
at home. We should be dreadfully poor 
if it wasn’t for that.” 
“Would you?” said Debby, wondering. 
“Oh, yes,” said Jane: “we’ve got no- 
thing else in the whole world.” 
“And you think he loves you?” said 
Debby. 
“Why, I’m sure he does,” said Jane. 
“He wouldn’t have done so much for me 
if he didn’t. That’s what mother said yesterday, when Tim Ryan said he didn’t 
believe any such thing. Mother said, 
‘ Just read the Bible, and you’ll see it, 
Tim .’ v 
“I guess you’re a real little traveller, 
Jane,” said Debby. But why Debby 
sighed as she said it, she herself did not 
know.
