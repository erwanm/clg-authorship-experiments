I’ll cable for my solicitors."

"What are you saying?" asked Mrs. Rivett in her gentle, uncertain
voice.

"Mother, Mr. Edgerton and I are going to be friends.  Perhaps he isn’t
sure of it, but I am.  Tell him what happens when I am sure of

exceedingly nice, mother; watch him!"

"Christine!  Please be a little less personal and abrupt."

They turned, smiling, toward the other end of the table where much
laughter sounded. Evidently Diana and Silvette were becoming very
popular, and, somehow, it occurred to Edgerton that perhaps this great

little woman beside him and take her to her great, gilded chair in the
drawing-room, and follow the men to another room, where blue smoke from
cigars presently floated to the ceiling.

Jack Rivett, rather too plump and smooth, moved into a chair beside
Edgerton; and the latter, who had prejudged him from his appearance, was
slightly surprised to find the youth widely read, widely traveled, with
a mind and even a wit entirely his own, and an original but sometimes
callow comment for any subject brought up.

In a desultory conversation it presently transpired that young Rivett
was a candidate for the Patroon’s Club.

"You’re a member, I believe; are you not?" he asked Edgerton.
