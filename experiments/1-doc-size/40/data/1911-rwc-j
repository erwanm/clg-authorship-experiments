looked at each other, and—and presently—presently we kissed each
other....  I don’t remember much else ... except that I said I would
marry him—before he asked me——"
"Did you also set the date?" inquired her father sarcastically.
"No....  Mother and I are considering.... Are you happy over it, dad?"
"Not violently."
"Why?"
"I don’t know anything about him," he snapped.
"Yes, you know that I’m in love with him."
"Certainly; of course.  Very worthy young man, no doubt."
"Also," continued his daughter calmly, "you know that Jim Edgerton is
his closest friend."
"That," said Rivett, "counts some."
"And mother likes him," concluded the girl.
Her father sat staring at her in silence. Suddenly she put her arms
around his neck, and the little man hid his spectacles on her breast for
a second.
"Thank you, dad, darling," she whispered.
"Chrissy—Chrissy—so soon!  I wanted you awhile yet." ... He jerked his
head free, produced a handkerchief, and began busily to polish his
eyeglasses.
"All right," he said brusquely, "I’ll talk it over with your mother....
She knows.... She knows more than I do.  They wouldn’t believe that in
Wall Street, but it’s true."
"Dad?"
"Yes, child."
"Couldn’t we live with you and mother?"
"Sure.  D’you think I’d let any young jackanapes take you entirely away?
You tell him I’ll scalp him if he talks that kind of thing to you." ...
He laughed harshly.  "But I’m a fool, Chrissy; you and I are talking
foolish.... You won’t come back to stay.  You won’t want to."
"I will!"
"No, dear; you don’t know yet....  Your mother and I made our own home.
It was a rough one, Chrissy, but it was ours.  You’ll do the same
ultimately.  It’s part of the game....  Tell your young man to come
here."
The girl slipped away; in a few moments Inwood knocked and entered.  Mr.
Rivett gave him a level and murderous look.
"How about that complication you got yourself into?" he asked harshly.
Inwood turned scarlet.
