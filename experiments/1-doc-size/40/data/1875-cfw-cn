him as a person of no importance, one of those 
men who, not of sufficient consequence to be dis- 
liked, are simply ignored by a well-bred world, which 
pardons anything rather than insignificance. And if 
ignored by a well-bred world, what by an ill-bred ? 
Society at Algonquin was worse than ill-bred, inasmuch 
as it had never been bred at all. Like all mining 
settlements, it esteemed physical strength the highest

There were some things in the room, however, 
other than furniture, namely, a shelf full of religious 
books, a large and appalling picture of the crucifix-
