awake, forming the word with silent lips, close to my young wife's
breast.

The full, yellow moon of June creamed all our garden now; Mount and
Renard sat a-squat upon the grass, chin on fist, to muse and muse and
wait--for what? The King of England did not know; but all the world
was waiting, too.

Then, one dim morning, while yet the primrose light tinted the far
hills, I awoke to see Silver Heels in her white night-robe, leaning
from the casement, calling out to me in a strange, frightened voice:
"Michael! Michael! They are coming over the hills--over the hills,
dear heart, to take you with them!"

At the window, sniffing the fresh dawn, I listened.

"Footfalls in the hills!" she said, trembling. "Out of the morning men
are coming! God make me brave! God make me brave!"

For a long time we stood silent; the village slept below us; the
stillness of the dawn remained unbroken, save by a golden-robin's
note, fluting from a spectral elm.

"It is not yet time," I said: "let us sleep on, dear heart."

But she would not, and I was fain to dress me in my leather, lest the
summons coming swift might find me all unready at the call.

Then she roused Betty and the maid and servants, bidding them call up
Mount and Renard, for the hour was close upon us all.

"Dear love," I said, "this is a strange fear that takes you from your
pillows there, at dawn."

"Strange things befall a blindly loving heart," she said; "I heard
them in my dreams, and knew them, all marching with their yellow
moccasins and raccoon-caps and green thrums blowing in the wind."

"Riflemen?"
