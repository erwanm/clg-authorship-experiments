“It’s too bad,” said the other, earnestly. “I have talked to them
sometimes, but it don’t do any good. I remember Davidson one night:
‘Jim,’ says he, ‘a fellow gets a whole lot of money, and he buys him
everything he wants, until at last he buys a woman, and then his
trouble begins. If you’re buying pictures, there’s an end to it--you
get your walls covered sooner or later. But you never can satisfy a
woman.’” And Mr. Gamble shook his head. “Too bad, too bad,” he
repeated.

“Were you in the steel business yourself?” asked Montague, politely.

“No, no, oil was my line. I’ve been fighting the Trust, and last
year they bought me out, and now I’m seeing the world.”

Mr. Gamble relapsed into thought again. “I never went in for that
sort of thing myself,” he said meditatively; “I am a married man, I
am, and one woman is enough for me.”

“Is your family in New York?” asked Montague, in an effort to change
the subject.

“No, no, they live in Pittsburg,” was the answer. “I’ve got four
daughters--all in college. They’re stunning girls, I tell you--I’d
like you to meet them, Mr. Montague.”

“I should be pleased,” said Montague, writhing inwardly. But a few
minutes later, to his immense relief, Mr. Gamble arose, and bade him
good night.

Montague saw him clamber laboriously into his automobile, and then
he turned to his brother.

“Oliver,” he asked, “what in the devil does this mean?”

“What mean?” asked Oliver, innocently.

“That man,” exclaimed the other.

“Why, I thought you would like to meet him,” said Oliver; “he is an
interesting chap.”
