think."
"Tressa?"
"Yes."
"Yes--what?"
"Yes--Victor."
"That's the idea," he insisted with forced gaiety.
"The thing to do is to face this rather funny situation and take it
amiably and with good humour. You'll have your freedom some day, you
know."
"Yes--I--know."
"And we're already on very good terms. We find each other interesting,
don't we?"
"Yes."
"It even seems to me," he ventured, "it certainly seems to me, at times,
as though we are approaching a common basis of--of mutual--er--esteem."
"Yes. I--I do esteem you, Mr. Cleves."
"In point of fact," he concluded, surprised, "we are friends--in a
way. Wouldn't you call it--friendship?"
"I think so, I think I'd call it that," she admitted.
"I think so, too. And that is lucky for us. That makes this crazy
situation more comfortable--less--well, perhaps less ponderous."
The girl assented with a vague smile, but her eyes remained lowered.
"You see," he went on, "when two people are as oddly situated as we are,
they're likely to be afraid of being in each other's way. But they ought
to get on without being unhappy as long as they are quite confident of
each other's friendly consideration. Don't you think so, Tressa?"
Her lowered eyes rested steadily on her ring-finger. "Yes," she said.
"And I am not--unhappy, or--afraid."
She lifted her blue gaze to his; and, somehow, he thought of her
barbaric name, Keuke,--and its Yezidee significance, "heavenly--azure."
"Are we really going away together?" she asked timidly.
"Certainly, if you wish."
"If you, also, wish it, Mr. Cleves."
He found himself saying with emphasis that he always wished to do what
she desired. And he added, more gently:
"You are tired, Tressa--tired and lonely and unhappy."
"Tired, but not the--others."
"Not unhappy?"
"No."
"Aren't you lonely?"
