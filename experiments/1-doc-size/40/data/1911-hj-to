“I gave up my protest. I told him that--so far as I’m concerned!--he
might do as he liked.”

Her poor friend turned pale at the sharp little shock of it; but if his
face thus showed the pang of too great a surprise he yet wreathed the
convulsion in a gay grimace. “You leave me to struggle alone?”

“I leave you to struggle alone.”

He took it in bewilderingly, but tried again, even to the heroic,
for optimism. “Ah well, you decided, I suppose, on some new personal
ground.”

“Yes; a reason came up, a reason I hadn’t to that extent looked for
and which of a sudden--quickly, before he went--I had somehow to deal
with. So to give him my word in the dismal sense I mention was my only
way to meet the strain.” She paused; Hugh waited for something further,
and “I gave him my word I wouldn’t help you,” she wound up.

He turned it over. “To act in the matter--I see.”

“To act in the matter”--she went through with it--“after the high stand
I had taken.”

Still he studied it. “I see--I see. It’s between you and your father.”

“It’s between him and me--yes. An engagement not again to trouble him.”

Hugh, from his face, might have feared a still greater complication; so
he made, as he would probably have said, a jolly lot of this. “Ah, that
was nice of you. And natural. That’s all right!”

“No”--she spoke from a deeper depth--“it’s altogether wrong. For
whatever happens I must now accept it.”

“Well, say you must”--he really declined not to treat it almost as
rather a “lark”--“if we can at least go on talking.”

“Ah, we can at least go on talking!” she perversely sighed. “I can say
anything I like so long as I don’t say it to him” she almost wailed.
