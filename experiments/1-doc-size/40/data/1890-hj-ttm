everything had happened), she would answer for Julia. For 
almost the first time in his life Nick disliked what Biddy said 
to him, and he gave her a sharp rejoinder, embodying the 
general opinion that they all had enough to do to answer for 
themselves. He remembered afterwards the way she looked 
at him, startled, even frightened, with rising tears, before 
turning away. He held that it would be time enough to judge 
how Julia would take it after they had thrown up the place ; 
and he made it his duty to see that his mother should address

a row." Grace shook her head and looked gloomy and deeply 
wise, replying that he had no cause to triumph they were so 
far from having seen the end of it yet. Then he guessed that 
his mother had complied with his wish on the calculation that 
it would be a mere form, that Julia would entreat them not
