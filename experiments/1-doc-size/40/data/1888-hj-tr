have read that one if your family hadn 't forced 
us," Delia said to her prospective brother-in-law. 
"Well, I shall never be forced I shall never 
again in my life look at one," he replied. 
" You 'll see you 'll have to 1 " laughed Mr. 
Dosson. 
" No, you 'll tell us enough." 
Francie had her eyes on the ground ; they were 
all smiling but she. "Won 't they forgive me, 
ever ? " she asked, looking up. 
" Yes, perfectly, if you can persuade me not to 
marry you. But in that case what good will their 
forgiveness do you ? " 
" Well, perhaps it s better to pay for it." 
"To pay for it?" 
" By suffering something. For it was dreadful." 
" Oh, for all you 'll suffer ! " Gaston exclaimed, 
shining down at her. 
"It was for you only for you, as I told you," 
the girl went on. 
"Yes, don 't tell me again I don 't like that 
explanation ! I ought to let you know that my 
father now declines to do anything for me," the 
young man added, to Mr. Dosson. 
" To do anything for you ? " 
"To give me any money," 
"Well, that makes me feel better said Mr, 
Dosson. 
"There 'll be enough for all especially if 
we economise in newspapers," Delia declared, 
jocosely. 
" Well, I don 't know, after all the Eever- 
berator came for nothing," her father went on, in 
the same spirit. 
" Don 't you be afraid hell ever send it now ! " 
cried the girl. 
"I'm very sorry because they were lovely," 
Francie said to Gaston, with sad eyes. 
"Let us wait to say that till they come back 
to us," Gaston returned, somewhat sententiously.
