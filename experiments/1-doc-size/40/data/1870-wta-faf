Louis for."
"I should think you would want to know something about your
family--your father and mother," added the lieutenant, to whom Mr.
Gracewood had related the substance of my history.
"I do, sometimes; but I am almost sure I should learn that one or both
of them were lost in the steamer."
"Perhaps not. Mr. Gracewood thinks your foster-father did very wrong in
not causing some inquiries to be made for your parents."
"I think so myself; but I can excuse him when I consider how much he
did for me, and the reason why he kept still," I replied, as I ran the
barge upon the shore at the lower end of the island.
"Have you any of the clothing, or other articles, found upon you?"
"I don't know of any."
"Almost every little child has a necklace, a ring, or some other
ornament upon it, especially when travelling."
"Matt Rockwood never said anything to me about such matters. He has a
chest at the Castle, which he always kept locked, and I don't know what
there is in it."
"Didn't you open it after he was killed?"
"No; the key was buried with him, and I did not exactly like to break
it open yet. Besides, I have been so driven about since we buried him
that I haven't had much time to think about it."
"I would open it, if I were you."
"I shall," I replied, as we walked up the slope towards the house.
"Perhaps there is something valuable in it."
"I know there is money in it, for we have sold a great deal of wood,
and he always put the gold into that chest."
"You may be a rich man yet, Phil."
"I don't know that the money belongs to me. I suppose Matt had friends
and relatives somewhere, though I don't know where they are."
"You have done as much as Matt, of late years, to earn this money, and
it would be a hard case to have it taken from you by his relations."
"I think it would. Matt did most of the chopping, and I did all the
hauling. But I meant to be honest, and the money shall go wherever it
belongs."

"Have you any idea how much there is?"
"Not the least; but I don't suppose there is a great deal," I replied,
as we reached the house.
