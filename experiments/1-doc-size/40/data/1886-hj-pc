old tobacco-pouch across the table to his visitor; and

silence. 'What will she do with you?' he inquired at 
last. 

'What will who do with me?' 

'Your big beauty Miss Henning. I know all about 
her from Pinnie.' 

' Then you know what she'll do with me ! ' Hyacinth 
returned, with rather a scornful laugh. 

' Yes, but, after all, it doesn't very much matter.' 



' I don't know what you are talking about, ' said 
Hyacinth.

' Did Pinnie tell you also about that?' his visitor asked. 

' No, our friend Eustace has told me a good deal. He 
knows you have put your head into something. Besides, 
I see it,' said Mr. Vetch. 

' How do you see it, pray ?'
