KAISING THE WOODVILLE. 
Ethan French, during the two years he had 
been a resident of the State of New York, had been 
an earnest and diligent student. His mind was even 
more improved than his manners. • His taste for 
mechanics had prompted him to study the various 
subjects incbided in this science, and as he stood by 
his companion the pilot, he talked quite learnedly 
about the specific gravity of wood and iron, about 
displacement, buoyancy, and similar topics. 
"The hull of the steamer — that is, the wood- 
work — will not only float itself, but it will sustain 
considerable additional weight," said he. 
" Yes, I understand all that," replied Lawry. " If 
there had been no iron in the Woodville she would 
not have gone down. ' 
" The iron in her engine is seven or eight times as 
 
heavy as the same bulk of water. Its weight carried 
the hull down with it." 
" Then we must put down empty casks enough to 
float the engine," added Lawry. 
" No ; the wood-work of the hulk will hold up a 
portion of the weight of the engine, and we must 
furnish buoyancy enough to sustain the rest of it." 
"It will not take a great many casks, then — 
will it?" 
" Not a great many ; but the difficulty is to get 
them down to the bottom, and fasten them to the 
hull." 
" I can do that," replied Lawry, confidently ; 
and he proceeded to explain to his interested friend 
the process by which the difficulty was to be over- 
come. 
Ethan approved the method, and promised to as- 
certain what weight each of the casks would sustain 
in the water, when he had obtained their dimensions. 
The ferry-boat reached the other side of the lake, 
and the young men went to see Mr. Nelson, the 
owner of the casks. He did not wish to use the
