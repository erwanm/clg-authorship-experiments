and I used to think that a real separation 
couldn't make matters much different. Not 
that Polly meant to be any different, or was, at 
heart ; but, you know, she was so much absorbed 
in her new life of splendor, and perhaps I was a 
little old-fashioned. 
I don't wonder at it now, as I look back. There 
was an army of dressmakers to see, and a world 
of shopping to do, and a houseful of servants to 
manage, and all the afternoon for calls, and her 
dear, dear friend, with the artless manners and 
merry heart of a girl, and the dignity and grace 
of a noble woman, the dear friend who lived in 
the house of the Seven Gables, to consult about

my honor, see that there was any place for me, 
and I went my own way, not that there was 
much comfort in it, 
And then I would rather have had charge of 
a hospital ward than take care of that uncle. 
Such coddling as he needed, such humoring of

wearied herself, that I could see, with her 
devoted ministrations. 
I fancied sometimes she was tired of it, and 
longed for the old homely simplicity. I was. 
Nepotism had no charms for me. There was 
nothing that I could get Polly that she had 
not. I could surprise her with no little deli 
cacies or trifles, delightedly bought with money 
saved for the purpose. There was no more 
coming home weary with office work and being 
met at the door with that warm, loving welcome 
which the King of England could not buy. There 
was no long evening when we read alternately 
from some favorite book, or laid our deep house
