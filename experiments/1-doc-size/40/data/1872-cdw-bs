liked to breast a north-wind, and that there was 
a certain inspiration in sharp outlines and in a 
landscape in trim winter-quarters, with stripped 
trees, and, as it were, scudding through the 
season under bare poles ; but that he must say 
that he preferred the weather in which he could 
sit on the fence by the wood-lot, with the spring 
sun on his back, and hear the stir of the leaves 
and the birds beginning their housekeeping. 

A very pretty idea for Mandeville ; and I fear 
he is getting to have private thoughts about the 





Young Lady. Mandeville naturally likes the ro 
bustness and sparkle of winter, and it has been 
a little suspicious to hear him express the hope 
that we shall have an early spring. 

I wonder how many people there are in New 
England who know the glory and inspiration of a 
winter walk just before sunset, and that, too, not 
only on days of clear sky, when the west is aflame 
with a rosy color, which has no suggestion of lan 
guor or unsatisfied longing in it, but on dull days, 
when the sullen clouds hang about the horizon, 
full of threats of storm and the terrors of the 
gathering night. We are very busy with our own 
affairs, but there is always something going on 
out-doors worth looking at ; and there is seldom 
an hour before sunset that has not some special 
attraction. And, besides, it puts one in the mood 
for the cheer and conrfort of the open fire at 
home. 

Probably if the people of New England could 
have a plebiscitum on their weather, they would
