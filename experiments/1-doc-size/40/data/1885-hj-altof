grow jealous of human success. Merchant, million- 
naire, banker, ship-owner, royal favorite, and minister 
of finance, explorer of the East and monopolist of the 
glittering trade between that quarter of the globe and 
his own, great capitalist who had anticipated the 
brilliant operations of the present time, he expiated 
his prosperity by poverty, imprisonment, and torture. 
The obscure points in his career have been elucidated 
by M. Clement, who has drawn, moreover, a very vivid 
picture of the corrupt and exhausted state of France 
during the middle of the fifteenth century. He has 
shown that the spoliation of the great merchant was a 
deliberately calculated act, and that the king sacrificed 
him without scruple or shame to the avidity of a sin 
gularly villanous set of courtiers. The whole story is 
an extraordinary picture of high-handed rapacity, 
the crudest possible assertion of the right of the stronger. 
The victim was stripped of his property, but escaped 
with his life, made his way out of France, and, betak 
ing himself to Italy, offered his services to the Pope. 
It is proof of the consideration that he enjoyed in 
Europe, and of the variety of his accomplishments, 
that Calixtus III. should have appointed him to take 
command of a fleet which his Holiness was fitting out 
against the Turks. Jacques Cceur, however, was* not 
destined to lead it to victory. He died shortly after 
the expedition had started, in the island of Chios, in 
1456. The house of Bourges, his native place, testifies 
in some degree to his wealth and splendor, though it 
has in parts that want of space which is striking in 
many of the buildings of the Middle Ages. The court, 
indeed, is on a large scale, ornamented with turrets 
and arcades, with several beautiful windows, and with 
sculptures inserted in the walls, representing the various 
sources of the great fortune of the owner. M. Pierre 
  
Clement describes this part of the house as having 
been of an "incomparable richesse," an estimate of its 
charms which seems slightly exaggerated to-day. There 
is, however, something delicate and familiar in the
