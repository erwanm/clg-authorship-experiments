these rascals stop and plunder travelers? However, the time will come
when there will be a different government.”
“Do you think so, Mr. Sanderson?”
“Yes, I do.”.
“When will that be?”
“When Italy is under the Stars and Stripes.” Bernard looked surprised.
“Surely you don’t think that will ever happen?”
“I am sure of it,” said Amos Sanderson, in a positive tone. “It’s the
manifest destiny of the United States to annex the rest of the world.
Within fifty years England will form a part of the great American
republic.”

at any rate.”
Amos Sanderson was impressed by this consideration, and no longer
allowed his mind to dwell on plans of escape.
Meals were served to the captives twice a day. This was probably as
often as the bandits ate themselves, for of all nations Italians are
perhaps the least fond of the pleasures of the table, and probably eat
