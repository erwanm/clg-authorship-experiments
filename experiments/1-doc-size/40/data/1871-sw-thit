ain't fair! Why should Matilda have all the good that comes to anybody?
Here this child can have everything she wants; and you and I, and
Maria, have to work and work and pinch and pinch, and can't get it
then."

"Is that your dress for every day?" said Anne, after she had lifted
Matilda's cloak to see what was underneath.

"I don't know, Anne."

"You don't know? Don't you know what you wear every day?"

"Yes, but I don't know what will be my every day frock. I do not wear
the same in the morning and in the afternoon."

"You don't!" said Anne. "How many dresses have you?"

"And what are they?" added Letitia.

Matilda was obliged to tell.

"Think of it!" said Letty. "This child! She has silks and cashmeres
and reps, more than she can use; and I, old as I am, haven't a dress to
go to church in, but one that I have worn a whole winter. I could get
one for twenty shillings, and I haven't money to spare for that!"

"Hush," said Anne; "we shall do better by and by, when we have gone
further into the business."

"We shall be delving in the business though, for it, all the while. And
Matilda is to do nothing and live grand. She'll be too grand to look at
us and Maria."

"Where do you live?" Anne asked.

"It's the corner of 40th street and Blessington Avenue."

Anne's face darkened.

"Where is Blessington Avenue?" asked Letitia.
