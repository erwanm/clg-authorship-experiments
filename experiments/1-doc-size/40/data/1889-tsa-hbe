had not a man, but a monster, to deal with.

"Whatever you want," he added, compassionately, "let me know, and be
assured that I mean you well."

With this comforting assurance he departed, while I prepared a cooling
salve and bandaged my wounds neatly. I drank quantities of lemonade
and broth, and felt that as the afternoon wore on, the heat in my
limbs was subsiding. Towards sunset, the kind cook again appeared, to
see how I was, and to inform me that the captain was raging like a
maniac on deck, for a coasting vessel had brought him news that my
former captain had sailed straight for Havana, and had there made all
sorts of complaints with regard to the robbery that he had sustained.
While he was speaking the captain himself rushed into the cabin.

"See," he cried, "what rogues your countrymen are. Spite of my
commands, that traitor sailed directly for Havana and entered a
complaint against me. But I know how to deal with him; I have sent
four bold fellows after him; he is a dead man if he lingers two days
longer, and to make all sure, I shall send a fifth this evening, who
understands his business well, and will despatch him without mercy."

With these words he left the cabin. "What a monster, what cruelty!" I
thought, but borne down by fatigue, I soon fell asleep.

I had been sleeping about two hours when I was roused by the captain.

"You must come on deck," he said, rather anxiously, "we are in
trouble."

Four sailors seized me, and immediately carried me above, sick as I
was. Here I learned that a boat was approaching in the darkness, and
that preparations for defence were being made.

"Hail it in English," said the captain.

I did so, but received no answer.

"Now let me try," he continued; "we'll see if they understand
Spanish."
