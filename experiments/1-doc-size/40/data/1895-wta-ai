is your name, my boy?" he continued, turning to his servant.
"Sayad, sahib," answered he.
Scott's was Moro, Morris's was Mobarak, and Felix's was Balaya; but the
last two were speedily abbreviated into "Mobby" and "Bally," to which the
young Hindus offered no objection. They were all under twenty years of age,
and spoke English passably well.
"Here, Sayad! black my shoes," said Louis, determined to make use of his
servant.
"I don't clean the shoes," replied the fellow, shaking his head. "I call
the porter;" and he did so.
"That is just what Sir Modava told me," added Scott.
But Sayad had opened his master's valise, placed his toilet articles on the
bureau, and brushed his coat, which he had taken off. He arranged
everything with good taste, and smiled expansively every time Louis looked
at him. The shoes of all four were polished in time; and they were ready to
begin their explorations of the city, though it was rather late in the day.
"What time is dinner, Moro?" asked Scott.
"Seven o'clock, sahib," replied the boy; and he was more of a boy than a
man.
"What time are the other meals?"
"Meals?" queried Moro.
"What time is breakfast?"
"Bring sahib coffee at six in the morning; breakfast at nine; tiffin at
one."
"What's that last one, Moro?"
"We had tiffin at Suez, and it means luncheon," interposed Morris.
"I didn't hear the word; but it is all right, and tiffin it is after this
time. Come; are you going down-stairs, fellows?"
"There is a public sitting-room down-stairs, and we will find that first."
The four servants followed them when they went down-stairs. None of the
party had yet gone to the public room except Sir Modava, though Lord
Tremlyn soon joined him. Their attendants stopped outside the doors.
"We are going to the tailor's now," said the Hindu gentleman. "As you are
aware, we lost all our clothes except what we had on, and we must order a
new supply."
"May we go with you?" asked Louis.
"Certainly; if you desire to do so. You may find something to amuse you on
the way, as we shall walk; for we want to get our sea-legs off," replied
Sir Modava. "It is only five o'clock here, and we have two hours before
dinner-time. Ah, here is Miss Blanche."
