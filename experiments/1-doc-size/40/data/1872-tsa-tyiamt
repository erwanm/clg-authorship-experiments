several days. I could get no word about Lloyd. 
Two other prisoners were put into my cell, which 
caused me to feel great uneasiness. Why had not 
Lloyd come back ? 
From one of these prisoners, a great, coarse, brut 
ish-looking fellow who came in on the third day 
after Lloyd was taken out, I got a newspaper, and 
  
turned instantly to the column of deaths, running 
my eyes along it. 
"LLOYD." I caught my breath at the word, 
and then read: "On the loth inst, suddenly, 
Thomas Lloyd. Funeral from his late residence, 
No. Poplar street, on the I3th inst, at ten o clock." 
I sat stunned and oppressed for a long time. It 
seemed as if God had taken up the cause against us, 
and was sending swift and awful retribution. I was 
afraid and humbled ; I felt that a power greater than 
man 's was at work, and that I was not able to stand 
against it. 
From that time I schooled myself to submission. 
I had no hope of getting out until the expiration of 
my term. My fellow-prisoners I had two others in 
the cell all the while I remained were far from be 
ing agreeable companions. One was coarse and 
brutish, as I have said a man of depraved instinct 
and vicious life; the other, a poor weak creature 
made criminal through bad associations. I got along 
with them as best I could, but against the intimate 
association I was compelled to have with such men, 
nature was in perpetual revolt. 
Poor Lloyd ! I could never get him out of my 
thoughts never banish from sight his awful face 
as I saw it last never get out of my ears his 
imploring cry, Oh, Hiram ! For God 's sake, 
Hiram !" 
How had he died ? Alone with unpitying keepers, 
in darkness, his soul went out from the pinioned 
 
body, and there was none who cared to tell the tale
