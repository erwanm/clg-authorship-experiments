"Please, mister, won't you give me some money to buy bread with?" he
asked, in a quivering voice.

"To buy bread with?" asked Sammy, in astonishment.

"Yes, please--I'm awful hungry."

"Ain't you had nuthin' to eat to-day?"

"Not a mouthful."

Sammy's compassion was aroused and he began to look over his change.

"Look out for that!" cried the tattered boy, looking upward suddenly.

Sammy's gaze traveled in the same direction. As his eyes went up the
boy in rags grabbed the money in his hand and in an instant was making
off through the crowd.

The movement was so quick, and the surprise so great, that for the
moment Sammy was bereft of speech.

At length he recovered sufficiently to shout the single word at the top
of his lungs:

"Constable!"

"What's the matter?" asked a policeman, running up.

"Thief! Robbery!"

"Where is the thief?"

"He ran off."

"Where? In what direction?"

"I--er--I don't know," stammered Sammy.
