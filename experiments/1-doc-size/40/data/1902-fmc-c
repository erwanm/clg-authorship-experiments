thought of what he was, and how little she cared for the things he had
spoken of, but how wholly for the man himself, her love for him rose in
her face, against her will.

"There must be something about him which makes you prefer him to Guido,"
he said obstinately.

"Yes. But I do not know what it is. Do not ask me about him."

"Considering that you are endangering the life of my dearest friend for
him, I think I have some right to speak of him."

She was silent, and they faced each other for several seconds with very
different expressions. She was pale again, now, but her eyes were full
of light and softness, and there was a very faint shadow of a smile
flickering about her slightly parted lips, as if she saw a wonderful and
absorbing sight. Lamberti's gaze, on the contrary, was cold and hard,
for he was jealous of the unknown man and angry at not being able to
find out who he was. She did not guess his jealousy, indeed, for she did
not suspect what he felt; but she knew that his righteous anger on
Guido's behalf was unconsciously directed against himself.

"You will never know who he is," she said at last, very gently.

"We shall all know, when you marry him," Lamberti answered with
unnecessary roughness.

"No, I shall never marry him," she said. "I mean never to see him again.
I would not marry him, even if he should ever love me."

"Why not?"

"For Guido's sake. I have treated Guido very badly, though I did not
mean to do it. If I cannot marry Guido, I will never marry at all."

"That is like you," Lamberti answered, and his voice softened. "I
believe you are in earnest."

"With all my heart. But promise me one thing, please, on your word."
