the thing in deference to 
popular sentiment, and in 
order that I might not, by its 
absence, be offensively con- 
spicuous, and a subject of 
remark. But the other editors, and all the printers, 
carried revolvers. I asked 
the chief editor and proprietor (Mr. Goodman, I will call him, 
since it 'describes him as well as any name could do) for some 
instructions with regard to my duties, and he told me to go all 
over town and ask all sorts of people all sorts of questions, 
make notes of the information gained, and write them out for 
publication. And he added : 
" Never say ' We learn ' so-and-so, or ' It is reported, or ' It

when tliere was a dearth of news. I can never forget my first 
day's experience as a reporter. I wandered about town 
questioning everybody, boring everybody, and finding out that 
nobody knew anything. At the end of five hours my note- 
book was still barren. I spoke to Mr. Goodman. He said : 
" Dan used to make a good thing out of the hay wagons in 
a dry time wlien there were no fires or inquests. Are there 
no hay wagons in from the Truckee ? If there are, you might 
speak of the renewed activity and 
all that sort of thing, 
in the hay business, 
you know. It isn't 
sensational or exciting, but it fills up 
and looks business like." 
I canvassed the city again and found
