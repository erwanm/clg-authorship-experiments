several hours every morning at her work, and they both have an afternoon
off once a week. Some people only let them go once a fortnight; but I
think they are human beings as well as we are, and I let them go every
week.”
“But, except for that afternoon once a week, your cook lives in
electric-light perpetually?”
“Electric-light is very healthy, and it doesn’t heat the air!” the lady
triumphed, “I can assure you that she thinks she’s very well off; and so
she is.” I felt a little temper in her voice, and I was silent, until she
asked me, rather stiffly, “Is there any other inquiry you would
like to make?”
“Yes,” I said, “but I do not think you would like it.”
“Now, I assure you, Mr. Homos, you were never more mistaken in your life.
I perfectly delight in your naïveté. I know that the Altrurians don’t
think as we do about some things, and I don’t expect it. What is it you
would like to ask?”
“Well, why should you require your servants to go down on a different
elevator from yourselves?”
“Why, good gracious!” cried the lady.--“aren’t they different from us in
every way? To be sure, they dress up in their ridiculous best when
they go out, but you couldn’t expect us to let them use the front
elevator? I don’t want to go up and down with my own cook, and I
certainly don’t with my neighbor’s cook!”
“Yes, I suppose you would feel that an infringement of your social
dignity. But if you found yourself beside a cook in a horse-car or other
public conveyance, you would not feel personally affronted?”
“No, that is a very different thing. That is something we cannot control.
But, thank goodness, we can control our elevator, and if I were in a
house where I had to ride up and down with the servants I would no
more stay in it than I would in one where I couldn’t keep a dog. I should
consider it a perfect outrage. I cannot understand you, Mr. Homos! You
are a gentleman, and you must have the traditions of a gentleman,
and yet you ask me such a thing as that!”
I saw a cast in her husband’s eye which I took for a hint not to press
the matter, and so I thought I had better say, “It is only that in
Altruria we hold serving in peculiar honor.”
“Well,” said the lady, scornfully, “if you went and got your servants
from an intelligence-office, and had to look up their references, you
wouldn’t hold them in very much honor. I tell you they look out for their
interests as sharply as we do for ours, and it’s nothing between us but a
