such times, thrust out houseless and hungry, to wander where he could,
he led a life of such utter wretchedness, that at length he determined
to steal for himself, and to go home no more. Then came years of
struggling vagrancy--during which, Mr. Carlisle, the prison was his
pleasantest home and only comfortable shelter; and whenever he was
turned out of it he stood in London streets helpless and hopeless but
to renew his old ways of thieving and starvation. Nobody had told him
better; no one had shewed the child kindness; was he to blame?"

"Somebody shewed him kindness at last," said Mr. Carlisle, looking into
the lustrous eyes which were so full of their subject.

"Who, do you think?"

"Impossible for me to guess--since you were not here."

"One of the most noted thieves in London went to one of the city
missionaries and told him of the boy and recommended him to his
kindness."

"Impelled by what earthly motive?"

"The misery of the case."

"Why did he not teach him his own trade?"

"The question the missionary put to him. The thief answered that he
knew a thief's life too well."

"I should like to see you before a committee of the House of Commons,"
said Mr. Carlisle, taking two or three steps away and then returning.
"Well?"

"Well--the missionary put the child with some decent people, where he
was washed and clothed. But it is impossible for met to tell, as it was
too bad to be told to me, the state to which squalor, starvation, and
all that goes with it, had brought the child. He went to school; and
two years after was well, healthy, flourishing, intelligent, one of the
best and most useful lads at the establishment where he was employed.
Now Lord Cushley has sent him to Australia."
