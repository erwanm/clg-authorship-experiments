" He is not clever," Mrs. Westgate declared. 
"Well, there have been clever people whom 
I have disliked," said Bessie Alden ; " so that I 
suppose I may like a stupid one. Besides, Lord 
Lambeth is not stupid." 
" X T ot so stupid as he looks!" exclaimed her 
sister, smiling. 
" If I were in love with Lord Lambeth, as you 
said just now, it would be bad policy on your part 
to abuse him." 
"My dear child, don 't give me lessons in pol 
icy !" cried Mrs. Westgate, " The policy I mean 
to follow is very deep." 
The young girl began to walk about the room 
again; then she stopped before her sister. "I 
have never heard in the course of five minutes," 
she said, " so many hints and innuendoes. I wish 
you would tell me in plain English what you mean." 
" I mean that you may be much annoyed." 
" That is still only a hint," said Bessie. 
Her sister looked at her, hesitating an instant. 
" It will be said of you that you have come after 
Lord Lambeth that you followed him." 
Bessie Alden threw back her pretty head like a 
startled hind, and a look flashed into her face that 
made Mrs. Westgate rise from her chair. "Who 
says such things as that ?" she demanded. 
" People here." 
"I don 't believe it," said Bessie. 
" You have a very convenient faculty of doubt. 
But my policy will be, as I say, very deep. I shall 
leave you to find out this kind of thing for your 
self." 
  
Bessie fixed her eyes upon her sister, and Mrs. 
Westgate thought for a moment there were tears 
in them. "Do they talk that way here?" she 
asked. 
" You will see. I shall leave you alone." 
"Don 't leave me alone," said Bessie Alden.
