Oh, you know, the aristocracy do so-and-so ; but 
in one 's own class of life it is very different. In 
one 's own class of life ! What is a poor unpro 
tected American woman to do in a country where 
she is liable to have that sort of thing said to 
her?" 

" You seem to get hold of some very queer old 
ladies ; I compliment you on your acquaintance !" 
Percy Beaumont exclaimed. " If you are trying 
to bring me to admit that London is an odious 



place, you'll not succeed." 

" Pour vous aidres. I never satirical contrary," 
Mrs. Westgate retorted. I make use of this expression, because both interlocutors had begun to 
raise their voices. Percy Beaumont naturally did 
not like to hear his country abused, and Mrs. Westgate, no less naturally, did not like a stubborn debater. 

" Hallo !" said Lord Lambeth ; lt what are they 
up to now ?" And he came away from the window, 
where he had been standing with Bessie Alden. 

" I quite agree with a very clever country-woman 
of mine," Mrs. Westgate continued, with charming ardor, though with imperfect relevancy. She 
smiled at the two gentlemen for a moment with 
terrible brightness, as if to toss at their feet 
upon their native heath the gauntlet of defiance. 
" For me, there are only two social positions worth 
speaking of that of an American lady, and that 
of the Emperor of Russia." 

"And what do you do with the American gen 
tlemen ?" asked Lord Lambeth. 

" She leaves them in America !" said Percy 
Beaumont.
