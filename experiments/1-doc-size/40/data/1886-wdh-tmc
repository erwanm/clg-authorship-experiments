a sort of ecstasy. Do you remember that fellow of 
Bret Harte s, in How Christmas came to Simpson 's 
Bar, who gets a shot in his leg, or something, when 
he 's riding to get the sick boy a Christmas present, 
and doesn't know it till he drops off his horse in a 
faint when he gets back ? " He jumped actively up 
from the table, and found the book on his shelf. 
" There ! " He fumbled for his glasses without 
finding them. " Will you be kind enough to read the 
passage, Mr. Barker ? I think I've  found the page. 
It 's marked." He sat down again, and the others 
waited. 

Lemuel read, as he needs must, and he did his best. 



 

" Ah, that 's very nice. Glad you didn't dramatise 
it ; the drama ought to be in the words, not the 
reader. I like your quiet way." 

" Harte seems to have been about the last of the 
story-tellers to give us the great, simple heroes," 
said Seyton. 

When the others were gone, and Lemuel, who 
had been afraid tp go first, rose to take himself 
away, Bellingham shook his hand cordially and 
said, "I hope you weren't , bored ? The fact is, 
I rather promised myself a tete-h-tete with you, 
and I told Mr. Sewell so ; but I fell in with 
Seyton and Meredith yesterday you can't help 
falling in with one when you fall in with the 
other ; they're  inseparable when Sey ton 's in town- 
and I couldn't resist the temptation to ask them." 

" Oh no, I wasn't bored at all," said Lemuel.
