His mother and Manda Grier came first, and then 
Statira when they would let her. She thought it 
hard that she was not suffered to do the least thing 
for him ; she wished to take him away to their own 
rooms, where she could nurse him twice as well. At 
first she cried whenever she saw him, and lamented 
over him, so that the head nurse was obliged to

Sewell came often to see him, at first in the teeth 
of his mother 's obvious hostility, but with her greater 
and greater relenting. Nothing seemed gloomier 
than the outlook for Lemuel, but Sewell had lived 
too long not to know that the gloom of an outlook 
has nothing to do with a man 's real future. It was 
impossible, of course, for Lemuel to go back to Mr.
