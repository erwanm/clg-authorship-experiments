needed refreshment at the stormiest moment of her 
indignation, and he deprecated without retort the 
denunciations aimed at him in Italian which did not 
perhaps carry so far as his conscience. The consul 
talked with him in a calm scarcely less shameful than 
that of Dr. Tradonico ; and at the end of their parley 
which she had insisted upon witnessing, he said: 

" Well, Mrs. Lander, you 've  got to stand this gouge 
or you 've  got to stand a law suit. I think the gouge 
would be cheaper in the end. You see, he 's got a 
right to his month 's rent." 

" It ain 't the rent I ca e for : it 's the candles, and 
the suvvice, and the things he says we broke. It 
was undastood that everything was to be in the rent, 
and his two old chaias went to pieces of themselves 
when we tried to pull em out from the wall ; and I 'll 
neva pay for em in the wo ld." 

u Why," the vice-consul pleaded, " it 's only about 
forty francs for the whole thing " 


" I don 't care if it 's only fotty cents. And I must 
say, Mr. Bennam, you 're about the strangest vice-con 
sul, to want me to do it, that I  eva saw." 

The vice-consul laughed unresentfully. " Well, 
shall I send you a lawyer?" 

" No ! " Mrs. Lander retorted ; and after a mo 
ment 's reflection she added, " I 'm goin to stay my 
month, and so you may tell him, and then I 'll see 
whetha he can make me pay for that breakage and 
the candles and suvvice. I 'm all wore out, as it is, 
and I ain 't fit to travel, now, and I don 't know when I 
shall be. Clementina, you can go and tell Maddalena 
to stop packin . Or, no ! Til do it."
