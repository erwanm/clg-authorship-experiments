I should certainly be awarded the Carnegie medal.
"Then that monster in human form laughed a horrible laugh, avowing
himself guilty of a crime still more hideous than the theft of the Silver
Moon eggs! Do you know what he had done?"
"W-what?" faltered Mildred.
"He had stolen from cold storage and had concealed the leaves of the
Bimba bush, brought from Singapore to feed the Silver Moon caterpillars!
That's what Boomly had done!
"And my Silver Moon eggs had already begun to hatch!!! And my
caterpillars would starve!!!!"
His voice ended in a yell; he struggled on his chair until it nearly
upset.
"You lunatic!" I shouted. "Was that a reason for spilling the blood of a
human being!"
"It was reason enough for me!"
"Madman!"
"Let me loose! He's hidden those leaves somewhere or other! I've torn
this place to pieces looking for them. I've got to find them, I tell
you--"
Mildred went to the infuriated entomologist and laid a firm hand on his
shoulder:
"Listen," she said: "how do you know that Professor Boomly has not
concealed these Bimba leaves on his own person?"
Quint ceased his contortions and gaped at her.
"I never thought of that," he said.
"What have you done with him?" she asked, very pale.
"I tell you, I don't know."
"You must know what you did with him," she insisted.
Quint shook his head impatiently, apparently preoccupied with other
thoughts. We stood watching him in silence until he looked up and became
conscious of our concentrated gaze.
"My caterpillars are starving," he began violently. "I haven't anything
else they'll eat. They feed only on the Bimba leaf. They won't eat
anything else. It's a well-known fact that they won't. Why, in Johore,
where they came from, they'll travel miles over the ground to find a
Bimba bush--"
"What!" exclaimed Mildred.
"Certainly--miles! They'd starve sooner than eat anything except Bimba
leaves. If there's a bush within twenty miles they'll find it--"
"Wait," said Mildred quietly. "Where are these starving caterpillars?"
