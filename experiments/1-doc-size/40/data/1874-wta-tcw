"And this was Harvey's room," continued the woman glancing around the
chamber, and then bestowing especial attention upon the fireplace.

"This was his room," replied Leopold, as he moved towards the door. "Can
I do anything more for you?"

"No, nothing now. You are the boatman, I believe; and you have bought a
new boat."

"I bought one just before Harvey Barth left the house. Did he tell you
about her?"

"Well, nothing in particular, only he said you were a great boatman, and
a very good boy."

As the woman did not seem inclined to say anything more, Leopold left
the room, and returned to the office.

"Can you make out what she is, Leopold?" asked his father.

"No; she says she is no relation to Harvey, but she was a good deal
interested in him. She seems to know all about me; but I suppose Harvey
Barth told her."

"I wonder what she is driving at?" added the landlord, whose curiosity,
as well as that of his son, was raised to the highest pitch.

"I haven't any idea. If she is not a relation of Harvey, what is she,
and why did she want his room?"

"I can't tell."

"How old do you think she is, father?"

"About forty, I should say."

"Harvey couldn't have been engaged to her, or anything of that
sort--could he?" suggested Leopold.
