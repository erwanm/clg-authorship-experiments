proprietor.

"Has your mother any experience?" asked the proprietor, a big man, with
sandy whiskers.

He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on
Nathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated.

"Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years."

"For whom has she been working?"

"For Nathan Gripp."

"Humph! Has Gripp discharged her?"

"No, sir; she has discharged him."

Mr. Jackson laughed, and nodded to his salesman. He rather enjoyed this
allusion to his rival.

"Then she didn't like Gripp?"

"No, sir. He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money.
He's a mean fellow."

"I don't admire him much myself," said the Englishman. "How much now did
he pay for vest-making?"

"Twenty cents apiece."

"We don't pay much more ourselves. There is so much competition that we
have to sell low."

"Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for
twenty," said Dan.

Mr. Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan:

"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?"
