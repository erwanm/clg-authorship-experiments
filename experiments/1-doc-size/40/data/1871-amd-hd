" But what can one do ! ' Mrs. Meredith would 
exclaim. " Cheap servants, like cheap furniture, 
never are worth the having. If your father could 
see this, Ada ; but he is like other men. He can 
understand nothing outside of his business. And 
how we are to live on such a mere pittance puz- 
zles me ! ' 

Ada didn't think it her place to dust the parlor 
or replace the scattered articles, or to look after the 
children. George and Willie were sent to school, and 


 

soon became insufferably noisy. Florence, missing 
the steady hand that had amused and governed, and 
growing tired of the lonesome nursery, fretted every 
one out of patience. Mary let the steam of washing 
and cooking get through the house, the tires were 
always going out, and the place was as comfortless 
as one could well imagine. 

Now and then Mrs. Meredith roused herself and 
made a spasmodic effort, but the task appeared so 
hopeless ! " There was nothing to do with," she de- 
clared continually. Ada practised her music a little, 
lounged in her own room, and, having no other re- 
source, eagerly devoured novels of all kinds, or took a 
languid walk, to be slighted and wounded by a cold 
recognition from some bygone friend, whom she be- 
wailed, in her solitude, with tears. 

Jessie tried to rouse her from her depression, but 
Ada met all her efforts with cold indifference. She 
invited her to dinners or suppers with a few pleasant 
guests, but even here she would not make herself 
agreeable. " It was not what she had been used to.
