"Not a bad thing, in such a pleasant place," he rejoined,
sending his blue eye all round my prospect. "But it is not so
pleasant a place as White Lake, Daisy."

Such a flood of memories and happy associations came rushing
into my mind at these words,  he had not given them time to
come in slowly,  I suppose my face showed it. The doctor
looked at me and smiled.

"I see it is Daisy," he said. "I think it certainly Daisy. So
you do not like Magnolia?"

"Yes, I do," I said, wondering where he got that conclusion.
"I like the place very much, if "

"I should like to have the finishing of that 'if'  if you
have no objection."

"I like the place," I repeated. "There are some things about
it I do not like."

"Climate, perhaps?"

"I did not mean the climate. I do not think I meant anything
that belonged to the place itself."

"How do you do?" was the doctor's next question.

"I am very well, sir."

"How do you know it?"

"I suppose I am," I said. "I am not sick. I always say I am
well."

"For instance, you are so well that you never get tired?"

"Oh, I get tired very often. I always did."
