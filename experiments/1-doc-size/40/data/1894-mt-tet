CHAPTER VIII 

BAPTISM OF THE BETTER HALF 

BY nine o'clock the town was humming" with the 
news of the midnight duel, and there were but 
two opinions about it: one, that Luigi's pluck in 
the field was most praiseworthy and Angelo's flight 
most scandalous; the other, that Angelo's courage 
in flying the field for conscience' sake was as fine 
and creditable as was Luigi's in holding the field in 
the face of the bullets. The one opinion was held 
by half of the town, the other one was maintained 
by the other half. The division was clean and 
exact, and it made two parties, an Angelo party 
and a Luigi party. The twins had suddenly become 
popular idols along with Pudd'nhead Wilson, and 
haloed with a glory as intense as his. The children 
talked the duel all the way to Sunday-school, their 
elders talked it all the way to church, the choir dis- 
cussed it behind their red curtain, it usurped the 
place of pious thought in the "nigger gallery." 

By noon the doctor had added the news, and 
spread it, that Count Angelo, in spite of his wound 
and all warnings and supplications, was resolute in 
his determination to be baptized at the hour ap- 
pointed. This swept the town like wildfire, and 
mightily reinforced the enthusiasm of the Angelo 
faction, who said, "If any doubted that it was 





 

moral courage that took him from the field, what 
have they to say now!"
