All seemed embarrassed, and only Pierre replied. He 
said, hesitatingly — 
' I — well, I hardly know what to say. It is a delicate 
situation. It seems offensive to refuse to believe a person 
when he makes so direct a statement, and yet I am obliged 
to say, rude as it may appear, that I am not able to believe
