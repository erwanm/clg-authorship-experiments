It was hard to tell how old the man was. He looked over seventy, but
there were indications that he had aged prematurely.

There was one other person in the room, one whose appearance
contrasted strongly with that of the old man. It was a boy of sixteen,
a boy with dark brown hair, ruddy cheeks, hazel eyes, an attractive
yet firm and resolute face, and an appearance of manliness and
self-reliance. He was well dressed, and, though the tenant of such an
humble home, would have passed muster upon the streets of a city.

"How do you feel, Uncle Peter?" he asked, as he stood by the bedside.

"I shall never feel any better, Ernest," said the old man, in a hollow
voice.

"Don't say that, uncle," rejoined Ernest in a tone of concern.

There seemed little to connect him, in his strong, attractive boyhood,
with the frail old man, but they had lived together for five years,
and habit was powerful.

"Yes, Ernest, I shall never rise from this bed."

"Isn't there anything I can get for you, uncle?"

"Is there is there anything left in the bottle?" asked Peter,
wistfully.

Ernest walked to the shelf that held the dishes, and took from a
corner a large black bottle. It seemed light and might be empty. He
turned out the contents into a glass, but there was only a
tablespoonful of whisky left.

"It is almost all gone, Uncle Peter; will you have this much?"

"Yes," answered the old man, tremulously.

Ernest lifted the invalid into a sitting posture, and then put the
glass to his mouth.
