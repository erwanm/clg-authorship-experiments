Tom knew that the fellow was lying, and remained silent.

"You made a little mistake about my intentions," continued Bill Crane,
smoothly, "but perhaps it was natural under the circumstances."

Tom thought it was, but still preserved silence, much to Crane's
discomfiture.

Bill Crane eyed him sharply, and saw his incredulity, but for that he
cared little, if only he could secure his silence.

"I think you will see that it isn't fair to me to speak of this matter,"
he continued.

"I had made up my mind not to speak of it," said Tom. "I don't want to
get you into trouble."

"Good-morning, Mr. Crane," said Lawrence Peabody, who had just come up.

"Good-morning, Peabody. I was watching our friend Tom. How are you
getting on?"

"I haven't done anything yet to-day. It's dirty work. I don't think
it's fit for a gentleman; Tom, there, is used to work, and he don't
mind."

"Shall we go round to Jack's?"

"All right!"

And the two walked away together.

"I am sorry Peabody doesn't keep better company," Tom said to himself.
"Bill Crane won't do him any good."
