say at the Union that years ago he used to do a

This talk was before dinner. She did not ask 
anything now about Carmen, though she knew 
that Jack had fallen into his old habit of seeing 
much of her. He was less and less at home, except 
at dinner-time, and he was often restless, and, she

tried to make up for his absence by extra tenderness 
and consideration for Edith and the boy. And 
this effort, and its evidence of a double if not di- 
vided life, wounded her more than the neglect. 
One night, when he came home late, he had been 
so demonstrative about the baby that Edith had 
sent the nurse out of the room until she could coax 
Jack to go into his own apartment. His fits of 
alternate good -humor and depression she tried to 
attribute to his business, to which he occasionally 
alluded without confiding in her. 

The next morning Father Damon came in about 
luncheon-time. He apologized for not coming be-

usual calrn^ but he looked pale and thinner, and so 
exhausted that Edith ran immediately for a glass 
of wine, and began to upbraid him for not taking 
better care of himself.

The only thing I've got to give is myself." 

" But you will not last,"
