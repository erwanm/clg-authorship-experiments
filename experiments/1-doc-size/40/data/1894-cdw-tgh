from his late life of ease and luxury to this of 
daily labor with a clerk's pay, that he had hours 
of revolt and cursed his luck. 
No, Jack's battle was not won in a day, or a 
week, or a year. And before it was won he need- 
ed more help than his own somewhat irresolute 
will could give. It is the impression of his biogra- 
pher that he would have failed in the end if he had 
been married to a frivolous and selfish woman. 
Mr. Fletcher was known as a very strict man of 
business, and as little else. But he was a good 
judge of character, and under his notions of disci- 
pline and of industry he was a kindly man, as his 
clerks, who feared his sharp oversight, knew. And 
besides, he had made a compact with Edith, for 
whom he had something more than family affec- 
tion, and he watched Jack's efforts to adjust him- 
self to the new life with sympathy. If it was an 
experiment for Jack, it was also an experiment for 
him, the result of which gave him some anxiety. 
The situation was not a very heroic one, but a life 
is often decided for good or ill by as insignificant 
a matter as Jack's ability to persevere in learning 
about the twine and cordage trade. This was a 
day of trial, and the element of uncertainty in it 
kept both Mr. Fletcher and Jack from writing of 
the new arrangement to Edith, for fear that only 
disappointment to her would be the ultimate re- 
sult. Jack's brief notes to her were therefore, as 
usual, indefinite, but with the hint that he was be- 
ginning to see a way out of his embarrassment. 
After the passage of a couple of weeks, during 
which Mr. Fletcher had been quietly studying his 
new clerk, he suddenly said to him, one Saturday 
morning, after they had looked over and estimated 
the orders by the day's mail, "Jack, I think you'd 
better let up a little, and run down and see Edith." 
" Oh !" said Jack, a little startled by the propo- 
sal, but recovering himself ; " I didn't suppose the 
business could spare me."
