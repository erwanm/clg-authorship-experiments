Mrs. Sutherland awaited us in the breakfast-room ; she, 
too, was very lair, but small and fragile looking. A sweet, 
patient face, bearing traces of much suffering, but not 
peevish or melancholy. Walter, four years younger than

" Yes," she replied ; " I think I do love him ; only it isn't 
the passion that girls talk about. He is noble, generous, 
thoroughly good and trustworthy, but a quiet man, like
