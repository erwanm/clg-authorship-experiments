" Perhaps they are." 
" Well, Captain Osborn, I don't believe your plan 
would have succeeded if the steamer hadn't caught

companion, apparently for the purpose of determining 
where he had seen the former. As they had both dressed 
themselves for the occasion, they submitted to his scru-

stowed no further notice upon them, and rode off to re- 
port to his commanding officer the failure of the hopeful 
enterprise. 
" Well, we have done some good by coming over here," 
said Captain de Banyan as the officer galloped up the
