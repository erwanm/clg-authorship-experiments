always afraid of him. He was kind to me, but in the abstract. I was like
an extra on the grocer's bill. He put me into the hands of a tutor--a
lovable old dreamer--and paid no more attention to me. He never put his
arms round me and told me fairy stories."
"Poor little boy! No fairy stories!"
"Nary a one until I began to have playmates."
"Do the ropes hurt?"
"They might if I were alone."
"What do you make of the beads?"
"Only that they have some strange value, or father wouldn't be after them.
Love beads! Doesn't sound half so plausible as Cunningham's version."
"That handsome man who limped?"
"Yes."
"A real adventurer--the sort one reads about!"
"And the queer thing about him, he keeps his word, too, for all his
business is a shady one. I don't suppose there is a painting or a jewel or
a book of the priceless sort that he doesn't know about, where it is and
if it can be got at. Some of his deals are aboveboard, but many of them
aren't. I'll wager these beads have a story of loot."
"What he steals doesn't hurt the poor."
"So long as the tigers fight among themselves and leave the goats alone,
it doesn't stir you. Is that it?"
"Possibly."
"And besides, he's a handsome beggar, if there ever was one."
"He has the face of an angel!"
"And the soul of a vandal!"--with a touch of irritability.
"Now you aren't fair. A vandal destroys things; this man only
transfers----"
"For a handsome monetary consideration----"
"Only transfers a picture from one gallery to another."
"Well, we've seen the last of him for a while, anyhow."
"I wonder."
"Will you answer me a question?"
"Perhaps."
"Do you know where those beads are?"
"A little while gone I smelt tobacco smoke," she answered, dryly.
"I see. We'll talk of something else then. Have you ever been in love?"
"Have you?"
"Violently--so I believed."
"But you got over it?"
