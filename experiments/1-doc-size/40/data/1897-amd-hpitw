but to come. The present Mrs. Deane thoug 
her sister the proper one to look after her. 

Aunt Hannah had not allowed herself to expc 
much, but she was disappointed. 

" I don't believe she is good for anything, 
always despised that kind of yellow hair. A: 
babyish ways ! I never gave a thought to Re 
but surely he can't be weak enough to be caug 
by such a simpleton ! That's just what she i 
Bessie, forsooth ! " 

Aunt Hannah sniffed indignantly. And yet t 
girl was her own kin. 

The supper was ready when Roy came in. 
was set in the kitchen. But it was a large, clea 
airy kitchen with no marks of servitude, since 
week before the range had been taken out to 
"shed," as the summer kitchen was esteemc 
The best rag carpet was put down, and the 



 

was a drain and a water faucet through on the 
other side. The fireplace was whitewashed and 
a box of ferns stood in it. There were white 
curtains at the windows, and quaint old rush-bot 
tomed chairs painted yellow, four of them being 
armchairs. It was a good enough living room, 
though they used the other on state occasions. 
Across the hall were two rooms again, but one 
had the old-fashioned high -post bedstead just as 
it had been left at Grandmother Palmer's death, 
and was used as a guest chamber, though Roy 
kept his desk and his business papers there, and 
last winter had added a bookcase.
