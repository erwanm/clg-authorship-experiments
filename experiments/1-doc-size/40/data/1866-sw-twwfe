"Who is our ark now, Tinyl An ark of gopher- wood 
wonld not save us in the day of that fire." 

"But Jesus ?"— I said softly. 

"  He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto 
God by him.'  The name of the Lord is a strong tower ; the 
righteous runneth into it and is safe.' ' There is no condemnation" — my uncle went on. 

" But, sir," said Eliphalet, "it is not such a proof of faith 
for people now to trust in the Saviour, as it was for Noah to 
build the ark" 

" To obey the Saviour is a great proof of faith, Liph, now 
as then j and makes a person just as unlike the rest of the 
world. Only now he is not alone in his faith ; that makes a 
difference ; and we have the advantage of much greater light 
than Noah had. But to this day, if a man will be for God 
only, as Noah was, he will have the world against him. And 
as I said, your faith is not worth much. You see it is not 
enough to make you go into the ark." 

" But, sir, the flood was very near ; that made it different." 

" So may the day of Christ's coming be very near." 

" But I thought it was a great way off" 

" Of that day and that hour knoweth no man.' It may 
come to-morrow. And if those I love were all ready for it 
I wish it would ! " 

" But, uncle Sam," I ventured, " won't it be a dreadful 
day?" 

" When Jesus comes ? Not to those that love His appearing, Tiny. That will not be the day that the world will be 
burned up — there will be a long space between ; but whether 
Christ comes to the world, or death takes us to Him, in 
either case our part and lot in the transactions of that last 
great day will be equally fixed and settled beforehand."
