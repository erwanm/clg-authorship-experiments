was it you were to tell me in Venice? " he asked. 



 

" I can't think, now." 

" Very likely something of yourself — or myself. 
A third person might say our conversational range 
was limited." 

" Do you think it is very egotistical ? " she asked, 
in the gay tone which gave him relief from the 
sense of oppressive elevation of mind in her. 

" It is in me, — not in you." 

" But I don't see the difference." 

" I will explain sometime." 

" When we get to Venice ? " 

They both laughed. It was very nonsensical ; 
but nonsense is sometimes enough. 

When they were serious again, " Tell me," he 
said, " what you thought of that lady in Messina, 
the other day." 

She did not affect not to know whom he meant. 
She merely said, " I only saw her a moment." 

u But you thought something. If we onty see 
people a second we form some opinion of them." 

" She is very fine-appearing," said Lydia.
