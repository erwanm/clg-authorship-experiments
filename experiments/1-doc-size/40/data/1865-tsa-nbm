himself. Eyes like hers read faces as if they were 
books. 
 
In less than twenty minutes John and Edwin went 
out together and were gone all the forenoon. Mrs. Guy 
knew to a penny ht>w much the purse contained when 
it came into John's hand ; for she had counted the half 
dollars and bills over twice. Two half dollars and a 
five dollar bill were missing. A gleam of satisfaction 
went over her face as this fact was ascertained, and she 
said to herself, speaking aloud 
" As I expected." 
It was nearly dinner time when John and Edwin 
came home. John was self-possessed, and rather jaun 
ty ; but Edwin's face wore a shy look, and there was an 
air of embarrassment about him that did not escape the 
keen eyes of his step-mother. Purposely, she drew near 
the two boys, so as to get their breaths in speaking ; 
and discovered, what she had already suspected, that 
they had been drinking some kind of intoxicating liquor. 
The fact did not shadow her placid brow. 
John was quieter than usual at the dinner table. 
Occasionally, Mrs-. Guy detected a look of inquiry, sent 
across to her half covertly. John was, evidently, in 
uneasy debate on the question as to her knowledge of 
his guilty inroad on her purse. 
The first course had passed, and they were nearly 
through with the dessert, when Mrs. Guy, without pre 
liminary, or warning, asked, looking at John 
" How much money did you take from my purse this 
morning ? " 
The suddenness with which she put the question dis 
concerted John. His face grew red, and there was 
some hesitation of manner, ere he responded, in an an 
gry, repellant tone, 
 
" I don't know what you mean." 
" You went to my drawer this morning ? " said Mrs. 
Guy, without the slightest sign of weakness in her even 
tones.
