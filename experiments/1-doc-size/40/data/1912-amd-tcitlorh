less, seedy aspect. The houses needed painting, 
the fences needed mending. It looked odd to 
see the woodpile on what seemed to be the side-

a belated washing and stopped to stare at him. 


Here sat an old man dozing. Children were play-

closer. There was a shoemaker, a blacksmith, a 
wheelwright, and the ordinary country store, 
with some men sitting outside with their chairs 
tilted, and a long watering trough at one 
side. 

A little girl came out of the store with a basket 
on one arm, and a crumpled bit of paper in her 
hand which she appeared to be intent on decipher- 
ing. She crossed over to the other side of the road, 
which was bordered by trees, and was quiet, seem- 
ing more retired. She stood still and read her 
note. Then she saw the man in the wagon had 
halted as if he wanted to speak. 

He did not quite know what to say, but he had 
a premonition she was one of the eight. She was 
clean and tidy, her hair braided in two thick tails 
below her wide-brimmed straw hat, a plump, 
cheerful-looking body, yet with a very earnest 
face.

Were you expecting some one?’'
