her in a sort of still preserved uncertainty of light 
that amounts virtually to darkness, and then 
after a time with her coming away with the un- 
certainty dispelled and the remarkable light in- 
stead taking its place. That gives me my very 
form and climax — in respect to the "way" that 
has most perplexed me, and gathers my action 
up to the fulness so proposed and desired; to 
the point after which I want to make it workable 
that there shall be but two Books left. In other 
words the ideal will be that this whole passage, 
using the word in the largest sense, with all the 
accompanying aspects, shall constitute Book 8, 
"Act" 8, as I call it, of my drama, with the de- 
noument occupying the space to the end — for 
the foregoing is of course not in the least the 
denotement, but only prepares it, just as what is 
thus involved is the occupancy of Book 7 by the 
history with Horton. Of course I can but reflect 
that to bring this splendid economy off it must 
 
have been practised up to VII with the most 
intense and immense art: the scheme I have al- 
ready sketched for I and II leaving me therewith 
but III, IV, V, and VI to arrive at the complete- 
ness of preparation for VII, which carries in its 
bosom the completeness of preparation for VIII 
— this last, by a like grand law, carrying in its 
pocket the completeness of preparation for IX 
and X. But why not ? Who's afraid ? and what 
has the very essence of my design been but the 
most magnificent packed and calculated close- 
ness ? Keep this closeness up to the notch while 
admirably animating it, and I do what I should 
simply be sickened to death not to ! Of course 
it means the absolute exclusively economic exist- 
ence and situation of every sentence and every 
letter; but again what is that but the most de- 
sirable of beauties in itself? The chapters of 
history with Rosanna leave me then 'to show,
