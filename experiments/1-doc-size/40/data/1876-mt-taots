Sawyer.”

“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you  like  it?”

The brush continued to move.

“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day?”

That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the
effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said:

“Say, Tom, let  me  whitewash a little.”

Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:

“No--no--I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful
particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it
was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and  she  wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful
particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way it’s got to be done.”

“No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I’d let
 you, if you was me, Tom.”

“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do
it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let
Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it--”

“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I’ll give you
the core of my apple.”

“Well, here--No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard--”

“I’ll give you  all  of it!”
