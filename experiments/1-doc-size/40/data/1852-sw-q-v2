"A wise man's addition," said Mr. Carleton; "but I trust you
will not think me extravagant. I will hold myself much obliged
to you, if you will let Mr. Thorn's folly, or impertinence, go
this time without notice."

Charlton absolutely laid down his knife in astonishment; while
at the same moment this slight let to the assertion of his
dignity roused it to uncommon pugnaciousness.

"Sir  Mr. Carleton"  he stammered  "I would be very happy
to grant anything in my power but this, Sir  really goes
beyond it."

"Permit me to say," said Mr. Carleton, "that I have myself
seen Thorn upon the business that occasioned his discomposure,
and that it has been satisfactorily arranged; so that nothing
more is to be gained or desired from a second interview."

Who gave you authority to do any such thing? was again in
Charlton's eyes, and an odd twinge crossed his mind; but, as
before, his thoughts were silent.

"My part of the business cannot have been arranged," he said,
"for it lies in a question or two that I must put to the
gentleman myself."

"What will that question or two probably end in?" said Mr.
Carleton, significantly.

"I can't tell!" said Rossitur; "depends on himself, it will
end according to his answers."

"Is his offence so great that it cannot be forgiven upon my
entreaty?"

"Mr. Carleton!" said Rossitur  "I would gladly pleasure you,
Sir; but, you see, this is a thing a man owes to himself."

"What thing, Sir?"
