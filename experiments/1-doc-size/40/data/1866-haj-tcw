stern a tone as his good nature would allow him to employ.
“Yes,” said Ida, promptly; “I bought two rolls at three cents a piece.”
“And what did you offer me in payment?”
“I handed you a silver dollar.”
“Like this?” asked Mr. Crump, holding up the coin.
“Yes, sir.”
“And do you mean to say,” said the baker, sternly, “that you didn’t know
it was bad when you handed it to me?”
“Bad!” exclaimed Ida, in great surprise.
“Yes, spurious. It wasn’t worth one tenth of a dollar.”
“And is this like it?”
“Precisely.”
“Indeed, sir, I didn’t know anything about it,” said Ida, earnestly, “I
hope you will believe me when I say that I thought it was good.”
“I don’t know what to think,” said the baker, perplexed.
“I don’t know whether to believe you or not,” said he. “Have you any
other money?”
“That is all I have got.”
“Of course, I can’t let you have the gingerbread. Some would deliver you
up into the hands of the police. However, I will let you go if you will
make me one promise.”
“Oh, anything, sir.”
“You have given me a bad dollar. Will you promise to bring me a good one
to-morrow?”
Ida made the required promise, and was allowed to go.
CHAPTER XIV. DOUBTS AND FEARS.
“WELL, what kept you so long?” asked Peg, impatiently, as Ida rejoined
her at the corner of the street, where she had been waiting for her.
“And where’s your gingerbread?”
“He wouldn’t let me have it,” said Ida.
“And why not?”
“Because he said the money wasn’t good.”
“Stuff! it’s good enough,” said Peg, hastily. “Then we must go somewhere
else.”
“But he said the dollar I gave him last week wasn’t good, and I promised
to bring him another to-morrow, or he wouldn’t have let me go.”
“Well, where are you going to get your dollar to carry him?”
“Why, won’t you give it to me?” said Ida, hesitatingly.
“Catch me at such nonsense! But here we are at another shop. Go in and
see whether you can do any better there. Here’s the money.”
