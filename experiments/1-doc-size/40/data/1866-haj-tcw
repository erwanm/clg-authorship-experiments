“So you’ve brought the gal. How did you get hold of her?”

There was something in these questions which terrified Ida. It seemed to
indicate a degree of complicity between these two, which boded no good
to her.

“I’ll tell you the particulars by and by,” said the nurse, looking
significantly at the child’s expressive face.

At the same time she began to take off her bonnet.

“You ain’t going to stop, are you?” whispered Ida.

“Ain’t going to stop!” repeated the man called Dick. “Why shouldn’t she?
Ain’t she at home?”

“At home!” echoed Ida, apprehensively, opening wide her eyes in
astonishment.

“Yes, ask her.”

Ida looked, inquiringly, at Mrs. Hardwick.

“You might as well take off your things,” said the latter, grimly. “We
ain’t going any farther to-day.”

“And where’s the lady you said you were going to see?” asked the child,
bewildered.

“The one that was interested in you?”

“Yes.”

“Well, I’m the one.”

“You!”

“Yes.”

“I don’t want to stay here,” said Ida, becoming frightened.
