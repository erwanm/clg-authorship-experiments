"But I am in love——"
"Wait," she said hastily.  "I’ll sing another funny song—the same sort
of song you found so amusing—about Naxos and Tenedos.  It is called
’Invocations.’"
As a little bird looks up to heaven after every sip of water, so Thusis
looked up after inspiration had sufficiently saturated her.  She lifted
her pretty voice as clearly and sweetly as a linnet sings in the falling
rain:
    "Wine poured out to Aphrodite,
    On thy sacred sands,
    In libations to the mighty
    Blue-eyed goddess Aphrodite
    Perfumes all thy strands,
    Scents the meadows and thy woodlands,
    Tenedos, my Tenedos!
    Every maiden understands
    Why each flowering orchard close
    Swims with fragrance of the rose.
    Votive wine that long ago
    Set thy sacred soil aglow
    Sweetens still each Grecian nose
    In Tenedos, my Tenedos!
    II
    God-like Bacchus with his flighty
    Band of laughing jades,
    Drank and sang and every night he
    Got so classically tight he
    Sought thy sylvan glades.
    Snoring where he gaily reveled,
    Tenedos, my Tenedos!
    Mid his pretty nymphs disheveled
    Sleeping off the over-dose,
    Waking late to vinous woes!
    Votive wine that long ago
    Set thy sacred groves aglow,
    Still exhilarates each nose
    In Tenedos, my Tenedos!"
"Oh, the cunning little song!" I exclaimed enchanted.  "But what is
Tenedos, anyway?  It’s an island, isn’t it?"
"It is," said Thusis solemnly.
