The queen ignored him, and he slyly batted one eye at the pretty
Countess Manntrapp, his neighbor, and tossed off a brimming goblet of
deep red claret.

"Aha!" he said, smacking his lips, "that beats even the wine of Naxos.
Did you ever drink Naxos wine, Countess?"

"No," said she; "is it very excellent?"

"Heady, Countess, heady!  After you crack one bottle you begin to see
the old gods of Greece sitting beside you on pink clouds in their
underclothes——"

"Tino!" snapped the Queen.

The Countess laughed.  "I’d like to see them."  She looked across at me
with her fascinating, audacious smile: "Wouldn’t you like to drink Naxos
wine with me, Mr. O’Ryan, and see the old time gods come down out of the
blue sky and sit at table all about you?"

"It seems to me," said I, bowing, "that Aphrodite has already arrived
among us mortals."

She laughed, acknowledging the raw compliment, then pursing up her red
mouth but uttering no sound she nevertheless formed her question so that
I read every word on her mobile lips:

"Do—you—know—anybody—who—would—play—Adonis—to—my—Venus?"

And she laughed her daring little laugh and made me a pretty gesture,
intercepted by Ferdinand of Bulgaria who took it for himself and
continued to ogle her out of passionate, pig-like eyes until further
engrossed in a new relay of food.

It was a dreadful dinner party.  Both the kings made life wretched for
Clelia and Thusis as they waited on table, slyly pinching them when
unobserved until, from Thusis’ burning cheeks and trembling hands as she
served me, I almost feared she would launch a plate at the royal
libertines.
