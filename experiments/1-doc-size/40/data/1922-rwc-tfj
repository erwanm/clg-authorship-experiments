"Wrap it around her wet hair," whispered Stormont. "Good heavens, I wish
there were a woman here."

"I wish so too," said Darragh; "she's chilled to the bone. You'll have
to wake her. She can't sleep in what she's wearing; it's almost as damp
as her hair----"

He went to the closet and returned with a man's morning robe, as soft as
fleece.

"Somehow or other she's got to get into that," he said.

There was a silence.

"Very well," said Stormont, reddening.... "If you'll step out
I'll--manage...." He looked Darragh straight in the eyes: "I have asked
her to marry me," he said.

       

When Stormont came out a great fire of birch-logs was blazing in the
living-room, and Darragh stood there, his elbow on the rough stone
mantel-shelf.

Stormont came straight to the fire and set one spurred boot on the
fender.

"She's warm and dry and sound asleep," he said. "I'll wake her again if
you think she ought to swallow something hot."

At that moment the fish-culturist came in with a pot of steaming coffee.

"This is my friend, Ralph Wier," said Darragh. "I think you'd better
give Eve a cup of coffee." And, to Wier, "Fill a couple of hot water
bags, old chap. We don't want any pneumonia in this house."

When breakfast was ready Eve once more lay asleep with a slight dew of
perspiration on her brow.
