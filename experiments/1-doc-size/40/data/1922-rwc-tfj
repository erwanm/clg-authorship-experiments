Night, too, came creeping like an assassin amid the ghostly trees.

So twilight died in the stillness of Drowned Valley and the pall of
night lay over all things,--living and dead alike.




EPISODE ELEVEN

THE PLACE OF PINES


I

The last sound that Mike Clinch heard on earth was the detonation of his
own rifle. Probably it was an agreeable sound to him. He lay there with
a pleasant expression on his massive features. His watch had fallen out
of his pocket.

Quintana shined him with an electric torch; picked up the watch. Then,
holding the torch in one hand, he went through the dead man's pockets
very thoroughly.

When Quintana had finished, both trays of the flat morocco case were
full of jewels. And Quintana was full of wonder and suspicion.

Unquietly he looked upon the dead--upon the glittering contents of the
jewel-box,--but always his gaze reverted to the dead. The faintest
shadow of a smile edged Clinch's lips. Quintana's lips grew graver. He
said slowly, like one who does his thinking aloud:

"What is it you have done to me, l'ami Clinch?... Are there truly then
two sets of precious stones?--two Flaming Jewels?--two gems of Erosite
like there never has been in all thees worl' excep' only two more?...
Or is one set false?... Have I here one set of paste facsimiles?... My
frien' Clinch, why do you lie there an' smile at me so ver' funny ...
like you are amuse?... I am wondering what you may have done to me, my
frien' Clinch...."
