herty, made me a present of this horse. 
She doesn't know much about horses. I 
think she got cheated ; don't you ? I hate 
to hurt her feelings. I don't tell her, 
except when he busts axles or runs over boys. 
He 's smashed up several boys. He 's a 
very interesting horse. Oh ! I tell you, 
Jerry, arrest the horse ! That 's it, Jerry, 
you arrest the horse for drunkenness in 
the first degree ! or couldn't you make 
it vagrancy ? You just get this animal to 
the station and look at what 's in the cart 
and I 'll venture you 'll be promoted ; 
and I 'll go home and learn my lesson. 
Won't that do, Jerry ? " 
Jerry smiled grimly. He could not help 
it. Nobody could help it when Marcy was 
in the case. He was such a happy-go-lucky, 
pleasant fellow. When his young voice 
pealed away into the rainy night, ringing 
merrily, shout on shout of happy, boyish 
laughter, Officer McCarty laughed, too, 
though he didn't mean to, and the police 
man and the culprit came up to the police 
station with a festive, innocent appearance, 
as if they were carting lemonade to a Sun 
day-school picnic. The officer was smoking 
one of Don Marcy 's best cigars, and Don 
himself leaned heavily against Jerry 's shoul 
der, as if they had been intimate friends. 
The police sergeant received them as a 
matter of course. He was not surprised to 
admit a student of Harle University within 
his own classic walls. He did, however, 
give one glance at the boy 's face with keen, 
experienced eyes, which said : 
" Ah ! a new one." 
But his lips said nothing at all. He 
opened his book silently to record the case. 
"Name?"
