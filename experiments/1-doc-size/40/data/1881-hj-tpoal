and it was already vivid enough to Isabel that Gilbert Osmond 
occupied this position. She found herself confronted in this 
manner with the conviction that the man in the world whom she 
had supposed to he the least sordid, had married her for her money. 
Strange to say, it had never before occurred to her ; if she had 
thought a good deal of harm of Osmond, she had not done him 
this particular injury. This was the worst she could think of, 
and she had been saying to herself that the worst was still to 
come. A man might marry a woman for her money, very 
well ; the thing was often done. But at least he should let her 
know ! She wondered whether, if he wanted her money, her 
money to-day would satisfy him. Would he take her money and 
let her go ? Ah, if Mr. Touch ett's great charity would help her 
to-day, it would be blessed indeed ! It was not slow to occur to 
her that if Madame Merle had wished to do Osmond a service, 
his recognition of the fact must have lost its warmth. "What 
must be his feelings to-day in regard to his too zealous bene- 
factress, and what expression must they have found on the part 
of such a master of irony ? It is a singular, but a characteristic, 
fact that before Isabel returned from - her silent drive she had 
broken its silence by the soft exclamation 

" Poor Madame Merle ! " 

Her exclamation would perhaps have been justified if on this 
same afternoon she had been concealed behind one of the valuable 
curtains of time-softened damask which dressed the interesting 
little salon of the lady to whom it referred ; the carefully- 
arranged apartment to which we once paid a visit in company 
with the discreet Mr. Eosier. In that apartment, towards six 
o'clock, Gilbert Osmond was seated, and his hostess stood before 
him as Isabel had seen her stand on an occasion commemorated 
in this history with an emphasis appropriate not so much to its 
apparent as to its real importance. 

" I don't believe you are unhappy ; I believe you like.it," said 
Madame Merle. 

"Did I say I was unhappy?" Osmond asked, with a face 
grave enough to suggest that he might have been so.
