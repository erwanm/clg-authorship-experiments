swelled on the air again; and now I saw, lying upon an old sofa, the
form of a man. It needed no second glance to tell me that this was
Judge Hammond. I put my hand upon him, and uttered his name; but he

soothe the last moments of his unhappy life?"

"Why did you make application here?" was the officer's significant
