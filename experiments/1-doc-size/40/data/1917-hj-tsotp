bravery, were some of the impressions that con 
sorted with her presence. When therefore she 
had, with whatever kindness, shaken her slow 
head at Ralph three times, there came to him a 
sad sense of his having staked his cast, after all, 
but on the sensibility of a painted picture. She 
had touched him at other times with a high hardness, whereas at present, clearly, she would have 
given anything to seem mild; only it was at the 
end of ten minutes of such mildness as if he stood 
under her closed window in darkness and sleet. 
This brought the truth home to him as it had 
not yet come: he had nothing in common with her 
apprehension so particular, so private as that 
would be of the kind of personal force, of action 
on her nerves and her senses, that might win from 
her a second surrender. Strange he had always 
thought it that her first had been, against all the 
likelihoods, Townsend Coyne, so queer though so 
clever, so damaged, to the extent even of considerably 
looking it, yet somehow so little touching in 
proportion, and so suggestive of experience, or at 
least of overstrained and ambiguous knowledges, y 
by the large expense of it all, as who should say, 
rather than by equivalents accruing in the way 
of wisdom or grace. Ralph reflected as to this, 
at the same time, that in the case of a relation 
of that intimacy, really of that obscurity, nothing 
was appreciable from outside; this was the com 
monest wisdom of life little indeed as it governed 
the general pretence of observation that no one 
but the given man and the given woman could 
possibly know the truth, or indeed any of the 
conditions, of the state of their being so closely 
bound. It didn't matter now therefore that the 
conditions of the Coynes had put him a question 
impossible to answer; the answer was Aurora's 
own, for whatever future application, whatever 
determination of her further conduct: she had 
been admirable and inscrutable that was the 
only clearness; though indeed with it one might
