conditions of the Coynes had put him a question 
impossible to answer; the answer was Aurora's 
own, for whatever future application, whatever 
determination of her further conduct: she had 
been admirable and inscrutable that was the 
only clearness; though indeed with it one might 
at a stretch inwardly remark that if the future 
did owe her amends she probably saw them as 
numerous. 
Could she have shown him, at any rate, in a 
burst of confidence, this compensating vision, he 
would have liked exceedingly to see it, even at 
whatever cost to his own pride; but she nursed 
it now, at least to begin with, in silence, only signing faintly, to his embarrassment, with her grand 
thick-braided head. What this most suggested 
to him was that if at twenty-two she had married 
a condemned consumptive she wouldn't now, at

 Chamber of Commerce, but he himself should 
 more fitly have been a Malatesta or a Sforza: then 
 she might have been contracted to a despot or a

had completely lowered his crest. "I see, I see," 
he said, "I'm even less possible to you than I 
feared; and heaven knows I hadn't sinned by 
presumption." She continued to say little in 
reply so little that, to ease positively for herself 
the awkwardness of so few attenuations, he risked 
expressing her view, risked even, for charity, 
making her contradict him. He imputed to her 
not quite a wish to dismiss him wounded, yet 
making her care enough to contradict him would
