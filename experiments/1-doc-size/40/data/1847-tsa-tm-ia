portance into obscurity. Our own uncorrected 
hereditary evils are also in our way, and hinder us 
from either seeing aright or doing aright." 
''You are disposed to look at the gloomy side 
of the picture, Anna," replied her husband, smilincr. 
'' Suppose you take a more encouraging view." 
" Show me the bright side, James. I will look 
at it with pleasure." 
'' There is a bright side, Anna — every thing has 
 
a sunny side ; but I do not know that it is in my 
power to show you the sunny side of this picture. 
I will, however, present to your mind a truth that 
may suggest many others of an encouraging nature. 
Into right ends there flows a perception of true 
means. Do you not believe this ?" 
" I have the best of reasons for believing it to be 
true." 
"Can there be a higher or holier end than a 
mother's, when she proposes to herself the good 
of her child ?" 
" J believe not." 
" Into that end will there most assuredly be an 
influx of wisdom to discover the true means. Do 
not despond, then. As your day is, so will your 
strength be." 
Anna sighed heavily, but made no reply for some 
moments. She was too deeply conscious of her 
ignorance of the true means, to feel a profound 
confidence in the practical bearing of the principles 
that her husband had declared, and which reason 
told her were true. 
" It is easy to theorize," she at length said. " It 
is pleasant to the mind to dwell upon true princi- 
ples, and see how they apply in real life. But, it 
is a different matter when we come to bring down 
these theories ourselves. There is in us so much 
that hinders. — Self love, indolence, pride, and a 
thousand other things, come between our good 
purposes and their accomplishment."
