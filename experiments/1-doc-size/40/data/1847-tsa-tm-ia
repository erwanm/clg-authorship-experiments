The love and praise of men ? — The attainment of 
all earthly blessings ? — No — no. — Tliese can only 
continue for a time. This life is a brief season at 
best — a mere point in our being — a state of prepa- 
ration for our real and true existence. In seeking 
the highest good of our child, we must look beyond 
the ' bounds of time and space.' " — i 

" If we do not, Anna, our seeking for the good 
of our child will be in vain. But, after determin- 
ing what are the best interests of our child, the 
next great question is how shall we secure them ? 
Thousands have decided as we have, but alas ! how 
few have been able to secure the right means. A 
religious education I know to be the only true edu- 
cation. All others must fail. But what is a reli- 
gious education ? It is in the wrong determination 
of this question that so many fail." 

" Can you determine it, James ?" 

" Not so well as you can. But do you not agree 
with me in the conclusion I have stated V 

" Assuredly I do. Religion is nothing more 
than heavenly order, and involves in it the true re- 
lation of the creature and the Creator. It is not 
the abstract, dark, austere and repulsive something 
that so many make it ; a thing of pharisaical sane- 
tity and unmeaning observances. No — no. Re- 
lig-ion clothes herself in garments of light, and 
wears upon her brow a sunny smile. All who 
look upon her as she really is, must love her." 

" Truly said, for she is the very embodiment of 
beauty. But, how few there are who see her and 
know her." 

''Too few indeed."
