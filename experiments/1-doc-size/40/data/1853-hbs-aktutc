  render it important and obligatory to bear testimony against it, yet
  would we not undertake to determine the degree of moral turpitude on
  the part of individuals involved by it. This will doubtless be found
  to vary, in the sight of God, according to the degree of light and
  other circumstances pertaining to each. In view of all the
  embarrassments and obstacles in the way of emancipation interposed
  by the statutes of the slave-holding states, and by the social
  influence affecting the views and conduct of those involved in it,
  we cannot pronounce a judgment of general and promiscuous
  condemnation, implying that destitution of Christian principle and
  feeling which should exclude from the table of the Lord all who
  should stand in the legal relation of masters to slaves, or justify
  us in withholding our ecclesiastical and Christian fellowship from
  them. We rather sympathize with, and would seek to succor them in
  their embarrassments, believing that separation and secession among
  the churches and their members are not the methods God approves and
  sanctions for the reformation of his church.

  5. While, therefore, we feel bound to bear our testimony against
  slavery, and to exhort our beloved brethren to remove it from them
  as speedily as possible, by all appropriate and available means, we
  do at the same time condemn all divisive and schismatical measures,
  tending to destroy the unity and disturb the peace of our church,
  and deprecate the spirit of denunciation and inflicting severities,
  which would cast from the fold those whom we are rather bound, by
  the spirit of the gospel, and the obligations of our covenant, to
  instruct, to counsel, to exhort, and thus to lead in the ways of
  God; and towards whom, even though they may err, we ought to
  exercise forbearance and brotherly love.

  6. As a court of our Lord Jesus Christ, we possess no legislative
  authority; and as the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church,
  we possess no judiciary authority. We have no right to institute and
  prescribe a test of Christian character and church membership, not
  recognized and sanctioned in the sacred Scriptures, and in our
  standards, by which we have agreed to walk. We must leave,
  therefore, this matter with the sessions, presbyteries and
  synods,â€”the judicatories to whom pertains the right of judgment to
  act in the administration of discipline, as they may judge it to be
  their duty, constitutionally subject to the General Assembly only in
