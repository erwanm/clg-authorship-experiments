with her beautiful smile. 

" I did n't think you would want me," said the 
young man, slowly sidling about. 

"One always wants a beau cousin, if one has 
one ! But if you are very nice to me in future I 
won't remember it against you." And Madame 
Miinster transferred her smile to the other persons 



 

present. It rested first upon the candid counte- 
nance and long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand, whose 
eyes were intently fixed upon Mr. Wentworth, as 
if to beg him not to prolong an anomalous sit- 
uation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his name. 
Eugenia gave him a very charming glance, and 
then looked at the other gentleman. 

This latter personage was a man of rather less 
than the usual stature and the usual weight, with 
a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a small 
quantity of thin dark hair, and a small mustache. 
He had been standing with his hands in his 
pockets ; and when Eugenia looked at him he 
took them out. But he did not, like Mr. Brand, 
look evasively and urgently at their host. He 
met Eugenia's eyes ; he appeared to appreciate 
the privilege of meeting them. Madame Minister 
instantly felt that he was, intrinsically, the most 
important person present. She was not uncon- 
scious that this impression was in some degree 
manifested in the little sympathetic nod with 
which she acknowledged Mr. Wentworth's an- 
nouncement, " My cousin, Mr. Acton ! " 

"Your cousin not mine ? " said the Baroness.
