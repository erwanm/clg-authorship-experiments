night. I must eat something first, though. That 
is one of my handicaps: I wear myself out and 
have to stop and eat. Will anybody ever love me 
for this work, will anybody ever understand it? 
I suppose I can get back where I was yester- 
day, but always it grows harder, and more stem. 
I set my teeth together. 
It was like the bursting of an overstrained 
dam, these last four days. How long I have been 
pent up — eighteen months! And eighteen

know how I have been choked — what horrors I 
have borne. 
I am through with that — I did not think of 
that. I am free I They will never have me back. 
That motive alone would drive me to my 
work, would make me dare anything. But I do
