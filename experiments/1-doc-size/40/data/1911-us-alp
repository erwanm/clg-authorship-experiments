3. THEN, late in the afternoon, came Corydon ; 
and this part of the adventure must have seemed 
stranger yet to the Channings. Corydon wore a shirt- 
waist and a ten-cent straw hat, trimmed with some white 
mosquito-netting, and an old blue skirt which she had 
worn before her marriage, and had enlarged little by

in again after the baby was born. Also she was pale 
and sad-looking, much startled by the sight of the 
automobile, and the sudden apparition of elegance. 
She got rid of her armfuls of groceries and bundles, 
and seated herself in an inconspicuous place, and sat 
listening while the argument went on. For a full 
hour she never uttered a word; only once during the 
controversy over the "Greek lady", Mrs. Channing 



 

turned to her and asked, "Don't you agree with me?" 
But Corydon could only answer, "I don't know, I 
have not read much history." And who was there to tell 
the visitor that this strange, wide-eyed girl knew more

set out the meal upon the rustic outdoor table; they 
apologized for thfeir domestic inadequacies, but Mrs. 
Channing declared that she "adored pickriicking". The 
evening was spent in more discussion ; and finally it 
was decided that the visitors should stay over night at 
the hotel in town, and come out again in the morning. 

Thyrsis concluded, as he thought the matter over, 
that the two must have been fascinated by this domestic 
situation, and curious to look deeper into it. Per- 
haps they saw "material" in it; or perhaps it was that
