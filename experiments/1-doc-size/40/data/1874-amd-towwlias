Something in the child's air and frankness touched Mr. Trumbull's
heart, and caused him to smile. He had a houseful of children at home,
every one of whom possessed a wonderful faculty for mischief; but this
little girl's bravery disarmed his anger.

"I want to explain to you that a fire like this might burn down a
handsome piece of woodlands worth thousands of dollars. All these large

various things. So it would be a great loss."

"I'm very sorry," returned Charlie. "I didn't know it would do any

"If I don't take you to jail this time, will you promise never to do it

Charlie shivered a little at her narrow escape.

"I surely wouldn't," she said very soberly.

By this time Mr. Trumbull had the fire pretty well out.

"Well, don't ever let me catch you at it again, or you will not get off

Charlie paused a moment, tugging at the cape of her sun-bonnet.

"I'm glad you told me about burning up the woods," she said. "I didn't
think of that."

Mr. Trumbull laughed pleasantly.

how to make bead-bags and moccasins"--
