he had been alone he might have felt the indifference 
as a slight, but as it was he felt it rather a favor. If 
Miss Shirley was feeling it a slight, she was too secret 
or too sweet to let it be known, and he thought that was 
nice of her. Still, he believed he might recognize the 
fact without deepening a possible hurt of hers, and he 
added, with no apparent relevance, " If Mrs. Westangle 
was not looking for us on this train, she will find that 
it is the unexpected which happens." 

" We are certainly going to happen," the girl said, 
with an acceptance of the plural which deepened the 
intimacy of the situation, and which was not displeasing 
to Verrian when she added, " If our friend's vehicle 
holds out." Then she turned her face full upon him, 
with what affected him as austere resolution, in con- 
tinuing, " But I can't let you suppose that you're con- 
veying a society person, or something of that sort, to 
Mrs. Westangle's." His own face expressed his mystifi- 

 

cation, and she concluded, " I'm simply going there to 
begin my work." 

He smiled provisionally in temporizing with the rid- 
dle. " You women are wonderful, nowadays, for the 
work you do." 

" Oh, but," she protested, nervously, anxiously, " it 
isn't good work that I'm going to do — I understand 
what you mean — it's work for a living. I've no busi- 
ness to be arriving with an invited guest, but it seemed 
to be a question of arriving or not at the time when I 
was due."
