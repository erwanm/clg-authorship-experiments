pulsively across the goat-skin, and gave his, with which 
he took it in some surprise, a quick clasp. Then they 
were both silent, and they got out of the carryall un- 
der Mrs. Westangle's porte-cochere without having ex- 
changed another word. Miss Shirley did not bow to 
him or look at him in parting. 
Vebbian kept seeing before his inner eyes the thin 
face of the girl, dimmed rather than lighted with her 
sick eyes. When she should he stronger, there might 
be a pale flush in it, like sunset on snow, but Verrian 
had to imagine that. He did not find it difficult to im-

He was aware of suffering a little disappointment in 
Mrs. Westangle's entire failure to mention Miss Shir-
