wandered, and in the reflection of the plate-glass window he caught sight
of Vjera's slight form at no great distance from him. He turned sharply
upon his heels and met her eyes, taking off his limp hat with a courteous
gesture.
"Permit me," he said, laying his hand upon the basket and trying to take
it from her.
Poor Vjera's face flushed suddenly, and her grip tightened upon the straw
handle and she refused to let it go.
"No, you shall never do that again," she said, quickly, trying to draw

basket. Thereupon he passed it to his left hand and offered Vjera his
right arm.
"Did the insolent fellow hurt you?" he asked anxiously, in Polish.
"Oh no--only give me my basket!" Vjera's face was painfully flushed.
"No, my dear child," said the Count, gravely. "You will not deny me the
