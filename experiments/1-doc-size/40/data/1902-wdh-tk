it ought, about this sad, sick girl, the heart of 
whose mystery he perceived, on reflection, he had 
not the wish to pluck out. He might come to know 
it, but he would not try to know it; if it offered 
itself he might even try not to know it. He had 
sometimes found it more helpful with trouble to 
be ignorant of its cause. 
In the mean time he had seen that these Kentons 
were sweet, good people, as he phrased their qual

personally revered, though its details were of much 
the same dimness for him as those of the Revolution and the War of 1812. The modest distrust 
which had grown upon the bold self-confidence of 
Kenton 's earlier manhood could not have been
