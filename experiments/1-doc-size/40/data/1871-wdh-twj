me in a very uncomfortable way; I’m tossed upon rapids, and flung from
cataract brinks, and dizzied in whirlpools; I’m no longer yours, Basil;
I’m most unhappily married to Niagara. Fly with me, save me from my
awful lord!”
She lightly burlesqued the woes of a prima donna, with clasped hands and
uplifted eyes.
“That’ll do very well,” Basil commented, “and it implies a reality that
can’t be quite definitely spoken. We come to Niagara in the patronizing
spirit in which we approach everything nowadays, and for a few hours we
have it our own way, and pay our little tributes of admiration with
as much complacency as we feel in acknowledging the existence of the
Supreme Being. But after a while we are aware of some potent influence
undermining our self-satisfaction; we begin to conjecture that the great
cataract does not exist by virtue of our approval, and to feel that
it will not cease when we go away. The second day makes us its abject
slaves, and on the third we want to fly from it in terror. I believe
some people stay for weeks, however, and hordes of them have written
odes to Niagara.”
“I can’t understand it, at all,” said Isabel. “I don’t wonder now that
the town should be so empty this season, but that it should ever be

suspension bridge. How beautiful that was! I rejoice in everything that
I haven’t done. I’m so glad I haven’t been in the Cave of the Winds; I’m
so happy that Table Rock fell twenty years ago! Basil, I couldn’t stand

O, I shall dream about it! and the rush, and the whirl, and the dampness
in one’s face, and the everlasting chirr-r-r-r of everything!”
She dipped suddenly upon his shoulder for a moment’s oblivion, and then
rose radiant with a question: “Why in the world, if Niagara is really
what it seems to us now, do so many bridal parties come here?”
“Perhaps they’re the only people who’ve the strength to bear up against
it, and are not easily dispersed and subjected by it.”
“But we’re dispersed and subjected.”
“Ah, my dear, we married a little late. Who knows how it would be if you
were nineteen instead of twenty-seven, and I twenty-five and not turned
of thirty?”
“Basil, you’re very cruel.”
“No, no. But don’t you see how it is? We’ve known too much of life to
desire any gloomy background for our happiness. We’re quite contented
to have things gay and bright about us. Once we couldn’t have made
