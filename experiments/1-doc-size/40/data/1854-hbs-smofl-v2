All felt, and heard, and enjoyed. I conversed with the prin- 
cess and with Frankomm. The former speaks English, the 
latter none. I interpreted for II., and she had quite a little 
conversation with him about his son, and about music. She 
told him she hoped the day was coming when art would be 
consecrated to express the best and purest emotions of humanity. He had read Uncle Tom ; and when he read it he 
exclaimed, " This is genuine Christianity " — " Ceci est la 
vraie Christiamsme ! * 

The attentions shown to H. were very touching and agreeable. 
There is nothing said or done that wearies or oppresses her. 
She is made to feel perfectly free, at lar«ge, at ease ; and the 
regard felt for her is manifested in a way so delicate, so imperceptibly fine and considerate, that she is rather strengthened 
by it than exhausted. This is owing, no doubt, to the fact 
that we came determined to be as private as possible, and 
with an explicit understanding with Mrs. C. to that effect. 
Instead of trying to defeat her purpose, and force her into 
publicity, the few who know of her presence seem to try to 
help her carry it out, and see how much they can do for her, 
consistently therewith. 

Tuesday, June 14. To-day we dined at six P. M., and read 
till nine. Then drove to an evening salon — quite an early 
little party at Mrs. Putnam's. Saw there Peter Parley and 
La Rochejaquelin, the only one of the old nobility that joined 
Louis Napoleon. Peter Parley is consul no longer, it seems. 
We discussed the empire a very little. " To be, or not to be, 
that is the question." Opinions are various as the circles. 
Every circle draws into itself items of information, that tend 
to indicate what it wishes to be about to happen. Still, Peter 
Parley and I, and some other equally cautious people, think 
that this cannot always last. By this, of course, we mean 
this " thing " — this empire, so called. Sooner or later it 
must end in revolution ; and then what ? Said a gentleman the 
other day, " Nothing holds him up but fear of the Red."  
That is, fear of the Red Republicans.
