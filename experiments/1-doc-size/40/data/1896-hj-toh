"You mean to see her then?" 

He sat with his eyes fixed, turning it over. 
"You must tell me two or three things first. 
Then I'll choose I'll decide." 

She waited for him to mention his require 
ments, turning to her teapot, which had been 
drawing, so that she could meanwhile hand him 
a cup. But for some minutes, taking it and stir 
ring it, he only gazed and mused, as if his 
curiosities were so numerous that he scarcely 
knew which to pick out. Mrs. Beever at last, 
with a woman's sense for this, met him exactly 
at the right point. " I must tell you frankly that 





if four years ago she was a girl most people 
admired " 

He caught straight on. "She's still more 
wonderful now?" 

Mrs. Beever distinguished. "I don't know 
about ' wonderful ' ; but she wears really well. 
She carries the years almost as you do, and her 
head better than any young woman I've ever 
seen. Life is somehow becoming to her. Every 
one's immensely struck with her. She only needs 
to get what she wants. She has in short a charm 
that I recognise." 

Her visitor stared at her words as if they had 
been a framed picture ; the reflected colour of it 
made a light in his face. " And you speak as one 
who, I remember, doesn't like her."
