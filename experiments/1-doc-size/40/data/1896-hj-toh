companion. "Why, I'll come back and take the 
child." 

Mrs. Beever met this offer with an alertness not 
hitherto markedly characteristic of her intercourse 
with Rose. " I'll send her out to you." Then, 
by way of an obeisance to Tony, directing the 
words well at him : " It won't indeed be a scene 
for that poor lamb ! " She marched off with her 
duty emblazoned on her square satin back. 

Tony, struck by the massive characters in which 
it was written there, broke into an indulgent 
laugh, but even in his mirth he traced the satis 
faction she took in letting him see that she 
measured with some complacency the embarrass 
ment Rose might cause him. " Does she propose 
to tear Miss Martle limb from limb ? " he humor 
ously inquired. 

" Do you ask that," said Rose, " partly because 
you're apprehensive that it's what I propose to do 
to you ? " 

"By no means, my dear Rose, after your just 
giving me so marked a sign of the pacific as your 
coming round " 

"On the question," Rose broke in, "of one's 
relation to that little image and echo of her adored 
mother? That isn't peace, my dear Tony. You 





give me just the occasion to let you formally know 
that it's war." 

Tony gave another laugh. " War? "
