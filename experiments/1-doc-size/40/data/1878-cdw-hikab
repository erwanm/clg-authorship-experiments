I recall the bearing of Old Phelps, when, several 
years ago, he conducted a party to the summit of 
Mount Marcy by the way he had " bushed out." 
This was his mountain, and he had a peculiar sense 
of ownership in it. In a way, it was holy ground ; and

that day was swept by a fierce, cold wind, and lost in 
an occasional chilling cloud. Some of the party, ex- 
hausted by the climb, and shivering in the rude wind,
