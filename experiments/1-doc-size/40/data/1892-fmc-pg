"I agree with you," said Donna Christina, in her quiet voice, on
Pietro's other side. "It is almost the only point on which my husband
and I differ--is it not true, Gianforte?" she asked, speaking across the
table to Campodonico. There had been a momentary lull in the
conversation after the little accident, so that he had heard what had
been said.
"It is quite true," he answered. "I believe in the jettatura, just as
most people do, but my wife is a sceptic."
"And do you really believe that Pietrasanta upset his glass because he
mentioned Lady Herbert?" asked Pietro.
"Yes, I do." Their eyes met quietly as they looked at each other, but
the whole party became silent, and listened to the remarks exchanged by
the two men who had once fought such a memorable fight.
Gianforte Campodonico was a very dark man, of medium height, strongly
built, and not yet of an age to be stout, with bold aquiline features,
keen black eyes, and a prominent chin. A somewhat too heavy moustache
almost quite concealed his mouth. At first sight, most people would have

this story about Lady Herbert Arden, I think it is nonsense in the first
place, and a malicious lie in the second, invented by some person or
persons unknown--or perhaps very well known to some of you. Half of it
rests on that absurd story about the chair I broke in Casa Frangipani.
If any of you can grow to be of my size, you will know how easily chairs
are broken."
There was a laugh at his remark, in which Campodonico joined.
"But it is true that you were speaking of the lady one does not mention
at the moment when the chair gave way," he said.
"Yes," said San Giacinto, "I admit that."
"I agree with San Giacinto, though I do not believe in the evil eye at
all," said Ghisleri. "And I will go a little further, and say that I
think it malicious to encourage the story about Lady Herbert. She has
