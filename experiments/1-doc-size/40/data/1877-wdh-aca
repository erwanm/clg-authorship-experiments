Cummings: "Yes." In great embarrassment: 
" Bartlett, General Wyatt has been here." 

Bartlett, without looking round : " Who is Gen- 
eral Wyatt?" 

Cummings: "I mean the gentleman who 
whom you wouldn't wait to see." 

Bartlett: "Urn!" He has gathered the things 
into his arms, and is about to leave the room. 

Cummings, in great distress: "Bartlett, Bart- 
lett! Don't go! I implore you, if you have any 
regard for me whatever, to hear what I have to 
say. It's boyish, it's cruel, it's cowardly to be- 
have as you 're doing ! " 



 

Bartktt : "Anything more, Mr. Cummings? I 
give you benefit of clergy." 

Cummings: "I take it to denounce your pro- 
ceeding as something that you 'll always be sorry 
for and ashamed of." 

Bartlett: "Oh! Then, if you have quite freed 
your mind, I think I may go." 

Cummings : " No, no ! You mustn't go. Don't 
go, my dear fellow. Forgive me ! I know how in- 
sulted you feel, but upon my soul it 's all a mistake, 
it is, indeed. General Wyatt " Bartlett fal- 
ters a moment and stands as if irresolute whether 
to stay and listen or push on out of the room 
" the young lady I don't know how to begin ! "
