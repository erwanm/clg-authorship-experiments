I dress queerly ? I know I looked ridiculous at 
times ; and people laughed at me before him." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " Oh, Constance, Constance ! Can't 
you understand that it was his unworthiness alone, 
his wicked heartlessness ? " 

Constance, with gentle slowness : " No, I can't 
understand that. It happened after we had learned 
to know each other so well. If he had been fickle, 
it would have happened long before that. It was 
something odious in me that he didn't see at first. 
I have thought it out. It seems strange now that 


people could ever have tolerated me." Desolately : 
" Well, they have their revenge." 

Mrs. Wyatt : " Their revenge on you, Constance ? 
What harm did you ever do them, my poor child ? 
Oh, you mustn't let these morbid fancies over- 
come you. Where is our Constance that used to 
be, our brave, bright girl, that nothing could 
daunt, and nothing could sadden ? " 

Constance, sobbing : " Dead, dead ! " 



 

Mrs. Wyatt : " I can't understand ! You are so 
young still, and with the world all before you. 
Why will you let one man's baseness blacken it 
all and blight your young life so ? " Where is your 
pride, Constance ? " 

Constance : " Pride ? What have I to do with 
pride ? A thing like me ! "
