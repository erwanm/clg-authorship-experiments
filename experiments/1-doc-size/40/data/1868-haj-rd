"You young rascal!"

"Hold on a minute, mister," said Dick, "and I'll tell you all about
it. The man what took the bill said it wasn't good, and kept it."

"The bill was perfectly good. So he kept it, did he? I'll go with
you to the store, and see whether he won't give it back to me."

Dick led the way, and the gentleman followed him into the store.
At the reappearance of Dick in such company, the clerk flushed a
little, and looked nervous. He fancied that he could browbeat a
ragged boot-black, but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a
different matter. He did not seem to notice the newcomers, but
began to replace some goods on the shelves.

"Now," said the young man, "point out the clerk that has my money."

"That's him," said Dick, pointing out the clerk.

The gentleman walked up to the counter.

"I will trouble you," he said a little haughtily, "for a bill which
that boy offered you, and which you still hold in your possession."

"It was a bad bill," said the clerk, his cheek flushing, and his
manner nervous.

"It was no such thing. I require you to produce it, and let the
matter be decided."

The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket, and drew out a bad-looking
bill.

"This is a bad bill, but it is not the one I gave the boy."

"It is the one he gave me."

The young man looked doubtful.
