chance to say "Yes." And Jimmie lay and moaned and wept, 
all by himself, quivering now and then with the perilous ecstasy, 
which does not last, but has to be renewed by continuous efforts 
of the will, as a tired horse has to be driven with spur and 
whip. Never, never could this battle be truly won! Never 
could the body be wholly forgotten, its clamorous demands 





wholly stilled ! God comes, but doubt follows closely. What is 
the use of this fearful sacrifice ? What good will it accomplish, 
who will know about it, who will care? Thus Satan in the 
eoul, and thus the eternal duel between the new thing that man 
dreams, and the old thing that he has made into law. 


 



A NO THEE day had come though Jimmie did not know it in 
"" his dungeon. All he knew was that Sergeant Perkins re- 
turned, and stood looking at him, picking his teeth with a 
quill. This little Bolshevik had stood the water-cure longer 
than any man whom Perkins had ever known, and he won- 
dered vaguely what sort of damned fool he was, what he thought 
he was accomplishing, anyhow. 

But it was necessary to keep after him, for Perkins knew 
that his career was at stake. He was supposed to have found 
out something, and he hadn't! So he ordered Jimmie tied up 
by the thumbs, the poor thumbs that were swollen to three times 
their normal size, and nearly black in colour. But now Jimmie's 
good Mother Nature interfered to stop the proceedings ; the pain 
was so exquisite that Jimmie fainted, and when the sergeant 
saw that he was being cheated, he cut his victim down and left 
him lying on the damp stones.
