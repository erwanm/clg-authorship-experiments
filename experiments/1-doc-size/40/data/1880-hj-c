them together ? " 

" Well, perhaps you will think me very fanciful," 
said Mrs. Vivian ; " but it was by the way he looked 
at Angela. He has such an expressive face." 

" He looked at me very kindly, mamma," Angela 
observed. 

" He regularly stared, my daughter. In any one else 
I should have said it was rude. But his situation is 
so peculiar ; and one could see that he admired you 
still." And Mrs. Vivian gave a little soft sigh. 

" Ah ! she is thinking of the thirty thousand a 
year," Bernard said to himself. 

" I am sure I hope he admires me still," the girl 
cried, laughing. " There is no great harm in that." 

'' He was comparing you with Blanche â€” and he was 
struck with the contrast." 

" It couldn 't have been in my favor. If it 's a 
question of being looked at, Blanche bears it better 
than I." 

" Poor little Blanche ! " murmured Mrs. Vivian, 
sweetly. 

" Why did you tell me he was so happy with her ? " 
Angela asked, turning to Bernard, abruptly. 

Bernard gazed at her a moment, with his eyebrows 
raised. 

" I never saw any one ask such sudden questions ! " 
he exclaimed.
