impress him disagreeably. He had not heard enough to know exactly what
had been said, but enough to feel that a set of coarse, low-minded men
were making quite free with the name and reputation of his Lillie; and
he was indignant.

“She is so pretty, so frank, and so impulsive,” he said. “Such women
are always misconstrued. I’m resolved to caution her.”

“Lillie,” he said, “who is this Danforth?”

“Charlie Danforth—oh! he’s a millionnaire that I refused. He was wild
about me,—is now, for that matter. He perfectly haunts my rooms, and is
always teasing me to ride with him.”

“Well, Lillie, if I were you, I wouldn’t have any thing to do with him.”

“John, I don’t mean to, any more than I can help. I try to keep him off
all I can; but one doesn’t want to be rude, you know.”

“My darling,” said John, “you little know the wickedness of the world,
and the cruel things that men will allow themselves to say of women who
are meaning no harm. You can’t be too careful, Lillie.”

“Oh! I am careful. Mamma is here, you know, all the while; and I never
receive except she is present.”

John sat abstractedly fingering the various objects on the table; then
he opened a drawer in the same mechanical manner.

“Why, Lillie! what’s this? what in the world are these?”

“O John! sure enough! well, there is something I was going to ask you
about. Danforth used always to be sending me things, you know, before
we were married,—flowers and confectionery, and one thing or other;
and, since I have been here now, he has done the same, and I really
didn’t know what to do about it. You know I didn’t want to quarrel
with him, or get his ill-will; he’s a high-spirited fellow, and a man
one doesn’t want for an enemy; so I have just passed it over easy as I
could.”
