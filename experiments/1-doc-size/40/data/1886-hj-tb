are just her life.' 
' Well, she may bring me round to them,' said Ransom, 
smiling. 
Miss Birdseye had been watching her blue car, the 
advance of which was temporarily obstructed. At this, 
she transferred her eyes to him, gazing at him solemnly out 
of the pervasive window of her spectacles. 'Well, I 
shouldn't wonder if she did ! Yes, that will be a good 
thing. I don't see how you can help being a good deal 
shaken by her. She has acted on so many.' 
' I see ; no doubt she will act on me.' Then it occurred 
 
to Ransom to add : ' By the way, Miss Birdseye, perhaps 
you will be so kind as not to mention this meeting of ours 
to my cousin, in case of your seeing her again. I have a 
perfectly good conscience in not calling upon her, but I 
shouldn't like her to think that I announced my slighting 
intention all over the town. I don't want to offend her, 
and she had better not know that I have been in Boston. 
If you don't tell her, no one else will.' 
'Do you wish me to conceal ?' murmured Miss 
Birdseye, panting a little. 
' No, I don't want you to conceal anything. I only 
want you to let this incident pass to say nothing.' 
'Well, I never did anything of that kind.' 
' Of what kind ?' Ransom was half vexed, half touched 
by her inability to enter into his point of view, and her 
resistance made him hold to his idea the more. ' It is 
very simple, what I ask of you. You are under no obliga- 
tion to tell Miss Chancellor everything that happens to you, 
are you?' 
His request seemed still something of a shock to the 
poor old lady's candour. ' Well, I see her very often, and 
we talk a great deal. And then won't Verena tell her?' 
'I have thought of that but I hope not.' 
' She tells her most everything. Their union is so close.' 
'She won't want her to be wounded,' Ransom said, 
ingeniously. 
'Well, you are considerate.' And Miss Birdseye con- 
tinued to gaze at him. ' It's a pity you can't sympathise.'
