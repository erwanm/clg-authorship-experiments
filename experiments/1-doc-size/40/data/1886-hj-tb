' How do you know what she is saying?' 

'  I can tell by the way her voice goes up and down. It 
sounds so silly.' 

Ransom sat there five minutes longer minutes which, 
he felt, the recording angel ought to write down to his 
credit and asked himself how Mrs. Luna could be such a 
goose as not to see that she was making him hate her. 
But she was goose enough for anything. He tried to 
appear indifferent, and it occurred to him to doubt whether 
the Mississippi system could be right, after all. It certainly 
hadn't foreseen such a case as this. ' It's as plain as day 
that Mr. Burrage intends to marry her if he can,' he said 
in a minute ; that remark being better calculated than any 
other he could think of to dissimulate his real state of 
mind. 

It drew no rejoinder from his companion, and after an 
instant he turned his head a little and glanced at her. 
The result of something that silently passed between them 
was to make her say, abruptly : ' Mr. Ransom, my sister 
never sent you an invitation to this place. Didn't it come 
from Verena Tarrant?' 

' I haven't the least idea.' 

'  As you hadn't the least acquaintance with Mrs. Burrage, 
who else could it have come from ?' 

'If it came from Miss Tarrant, I ought at least to 
recognise her courtesy by listening to her.' 

' If you rise from this sofa I will tell Olive what I 
suspect. She will be perfectly capable of carrying Verena 
off to China or anywhere out of your reach.'
