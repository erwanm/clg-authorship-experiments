" I didn't know but I had snored," said the old 
man, sitting up. 

"No," said his wife. Then she asked wistfully, 
" Was you out at the old place, Jacob ? " 



 

"Yes." 

" Did it look natural ? " 

" Yes ; mostly. They 're sinking the wells down 
in the woods pasture." 

" And — the children's graves ? " 

" They haven't touched that part. But I reckon 
we got to have 'cm moved to the cemetery. I bought 
a lot." 

The old woman began softly to weep. " It does 
seem too hard that they can't be let to rest in peace, 
pore little things. I wanted you and me to lay there 
too, when our time come, Jacob. Just there, back 
o' the beehives, and under them shoomakes — my, I 
can see the very place ! And I don't believe I 'll 
ever feel at home anywheres else. I woon't know 
where I am when the trumpet sounds. I have to 
think before I can tell where the east is in New 
York ; and what if I should git faced the wrong 
way when I raise  Jacob, I wonder you could sell 
it ! " Her head shook, and the fire-light shone on 
her tears, as she searched the folds of her dress for 
her pocket. 

A peal of laughter came from the drawing-room, 
and then the sound of chords struck on the piano.
