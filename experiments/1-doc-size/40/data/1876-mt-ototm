last trip." ' 
" Very good. Is the river rising or falling ? " 
" Rising." 
" No it ain't.'' 
" I guess I am right, sir. Yonder is some drift- 
wood floating down the stream." 
" A rise starts the drift-wood, but then it keeps 
on floating a while after th river is done rising. 
Now the bank will tell you about this. Wait till 
you come to a place where it shelves a little. Now 
here ; do you see this narrow belt of fine sediment ? 
That was deposited while the water was higher. 
You see the drift-wood begins to strand, too. The 
bank helps in other ways. Do you see that stump 
on the false point ? " 
" Ay, ay, sir." 
" Well, the water is just up to the roots of it. 
You must make a note of that." 
" Why ? " 
" Because that means that there 's seven feet in 
the chute of 103." 
" But 103 is a long way up the river yet." 
" That 's where the benefit of the bank comes in. 
There is water enough in 103 noiv, yet there may 
not be by the time we get there ; but the bank will 
keep us posted all along. You don't run close chutes 
on a falling river, up-stream, and there are precious 
few of them you are allowed to run at all down- 
stream. There 's a law of the United States against 
it. The river may be rising by the time we get to 
103, and in that case we 'll run it. We are draw- 
ing — how much ? " 
" Six feet aft, — six and a half forward." 
" Well, you do seem to know something." 
" But what I particularly want to know is, if I 
have got to keep up an everlasting measuring of 
the banks of this river, twelve hundred miles, 
month in and month out ? " 
" Of course ! " 
My emotions were too deep for words for a while.
