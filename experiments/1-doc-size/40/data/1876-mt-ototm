" But 103 is a long way up the river yet." 
" That 's where the benefit of the bank comes in. 
There is water enough in 103 noiv, yet there may 
not be by the time we get there ; but the bank will 
keep us posted all along. You don't run close chutes 
on a falling river, up-stream, and there are precious

" Well, you do seem to know something." 
" But what I particularly want to know is, if I

we 'll go up behind bars that you 've always seen 
standing out of the river, high and dry like the 
roof of a house ; we 'll cut across low places that 
you've never noticed at all, right through the mid- 
dle of bars that cover fifty acres of i iver ; we 'll 
creep through cracks where you 've always tliought 
was solid land ; we 'll dart through the woods and 
leave twenty-five miles of river otf to one side; 
we 'll see the hind-side of every island between
