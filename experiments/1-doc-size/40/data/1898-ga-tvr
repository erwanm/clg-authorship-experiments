" It snows," said Anastacio ; " but we 
are soon there." 

" We are in the Sierras," thought Rol 
dan. He looked about with intense in 
terest; he had never seen snow before; 
and to penetrate the mystery of the mighty 
Sierras had been one of the hopes of his 

life. The ground was white, and crunched 
under the horses hoofs. The air was 
thick with snow-stars glittering under the 
full radiance of the moon. Roldan forgot 
that he was a captive. His mind had 
made its first impulse to the mysteries of 
night and solitude during the few moments 
between his entry into another forest and 
the encounter with the bear ; it now made 
its first real opening. He was vaguely 
troubled by the embryonic thoughts that 
in their maturity come to men who have 
lived and suffered, when they are alone in 
a forest at night, far from other men. 

Again they plunged into the forest. No 
snow penetrated the treetops, knit to 
gether by centuries and storms. All was 
black again, and the deep ocean of leaf 
and branch roared faintly overhead. 

Roldan felt oppressed and thoughtful. 
He looked into the future and saw himself 
a man. He would be governor of the Cal- 
ifornias, and make himself a good and 
great man, wiser than the idle caballeros 
who patronised him ; he would teach them 
the folly of their useless lives.
