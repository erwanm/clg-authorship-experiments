I know it pretty well, and there was no 
danger of gittin lost. At nightfall I 
found your horses and ponchos the 
horses was dead, poor things. I slept on 
the desert that night, and the next mornin 
rode back as hard as I could put, suspicion that you would have sense enough 
to strike west. I went round the corner 
of that there cactus wood, never thinkin 
ye were in it, and I expect I got well to 
this side before you was out. When I got 
to this creek I rode up and clown it, then 
crossed over, thinkin ye might hev gone 
on. It was only when I saw smoke 
that I said to myself for the fust time : 
"There they be. And you bet it did me 
good, for I was powerful worried."

kind and good man. I love you, and I 
will always be your friend." 

" So. Well, I'm powerful glad to hear 
that. You ain't much like Merican kids, 
but you're pretty clever all the same, and I 
like ye better n any boy I ever know'd, 
hanged if I don t. Don't be jealous,

Roily well ! " 

" You would not like Roldan half so 
well if it were not for me," said Adan,
