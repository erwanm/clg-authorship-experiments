accurate, “ it’s a h— 1 of a place.” A description which 
was photographic for exactness. There were several 
rows and clusters of shabby frame houses, and a 
supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a 
famine in that article for a hundred years; for the 
overflow had but lately subsided. There were stagnant 
ponds in the streets, here and there, and a dozen rude 
scows were scattered about, lying aground wherever 
they happened to have been when the waters drained 
off and people could do their visiting and shopping on 
foot once more. Still, it is a thriving place, with a 
rich country behind it, an elevator in front of it, and 
also a fine big mill for the manufacture of cotton-seed 
oil. I had never seen this kind of a mill before. 

Cotton-seed was comparatively valueless in my time ; 
but it is worth twelve or thirteen dollars a ton now, 
and none of it is thrown away. The oil made from it 
is colorless, tasteless, and almost, if not entirely, odor- 
less. It is claimed that it can, by proper manipula- 
tion, be made to resemble and perform the office of 
any and all oils, and be produced at a cheaper rate 
than the cheapest of the originals. Sagacious people 
shipped it to Italy, doctored it, labeled it, and brought 
it back as olive oil. This trade grew to be so formi- 
dable that Italy was obliged to put a prohibitory impost 
upon it to keep it from vorking serious injury to her 
oil industry. 

Helena occupies one of the prettiest situations on 
the Mississippi. Her perch is the last, the southern- 
most group of hills which one sees on that side of the 
river. In its normal condition it is a pretty town ; but 
the flood (or possibly the seepage) had lately been 
ravaging it ; whole streets of houses had been invaded 
by the muddy water, and the outsides of the buildings 
were still belted with a broad stain extending upward 
from the foundations. Stranded and discarded scows 
lay all about; plank sidewalks on stilts four feet high 
were still standing ; the broad sidewalks on the ground
