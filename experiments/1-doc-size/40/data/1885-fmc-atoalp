"Would you tell Mrs. Goddard--or not?" asked Mr. Juxon at last.

"I don't know," said the vicar. "I am amazed beyond measure." He turned
and slowly came back to the table.

"I don't know either," replied the squire. "That is precisely the point
upon which I think we ought to decide. I have known about the story for

case."

"But think of the anxiety she will be in until he is caught!" cried the
