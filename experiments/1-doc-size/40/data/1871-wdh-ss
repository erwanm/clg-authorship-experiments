yellow sunlight falls upon a body of good comrades 
who are grooming a marvelous number of piebald 
steeds about the stable-doors. By token of these 
beasts — which always look so much more like works 
of art than of nature — I know that there is to be a 
circus somewhere very soon ; and the gay bills pasted 
all over the stable-front tell me that there are to be 
two performances at the Port on the morrow. The 
grooms talk nothing and joke nothing but horse at 
their labor ; and their life seems such a low, igno- 
rant, happy life, that the secret nomad lurking in 
every respectable and stationary personality stirs 
within me and struggles to strike hands of fellowship 
with them. They lead a sort of pastoral existence 
in our age of railroads ; they wander over the con- 
 
tinent with their great caravan, and everywhere 
pursue the summer from south to North and from 
North to South again ; in the mild forenoons they 
groom their herds, and in the afternoons they doze 
under their wagons, indifferent to the tumult of the 
crowd within and without the mighty canvas near 
them, — doze face downwards on the bruised, sweet- 
smelling grass ; and in the starry midnight rise and 
strike their tents, and set forth again over the still 
country roads, to take the next village on the mor- 
row with the blaze and splendor of their " Grand 
Entree." The triumphal chariot in which the musi- 
cians are borne at the head of the procession is com- 
posed, as I perceive by the bills, of four colossal gilt 
swans, set tail to tail, with lifted wings and curving 
necks j but the chariot, as I behold it beside the sta- 
ble, is mysteriously draped in white canvas, through 
which its gilding glitters only here and there. And 
does it inove thus shrouded in the company's wander- 
ings from place to place, and is the precious spottiness 
of the piebalds then hidden under envious drapery ? 
O happy grooms, — not clean as to shirts, nor espe- 
cially neat in your conversation, but displaying a 
Wealth of art in India-ink upon your manly chests
