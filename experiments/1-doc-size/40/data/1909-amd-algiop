only in certain dainty ways. And her blue eyes came from him. He was
rather glad of that.

"Don't you want them to be glad that I am back?"

"Why?"--she looked up perplexed. She was not old enough to define her
emotions. "Of course I should want them to be glad."

"Yet you are a little jealous."

"Jealous!" she repeated. The word had no clearly definite meaning to
her.

"Maybe I have crowded you out a little. But you will find as you grow
that there is a great deal of love that can be given and not make any
one the poorer."

"What is jealousy?"

She had been following out her own thought and hardly minded his
truism.

"Why"--how could he define it to the child's limited understanding?
"Jealousy is wanting all of another's regard and not being willing
that any other shall have a share. Not being willing that grandad
shall care for me."

"He wasn't glad at first." She could not forget that.

"It wasn't a question of wanting or not wanting me that made him
captious. He could not enjoy the English being beaten. I do not
understand that in him since he means to spend all the rest of his
life here, and has never wanted to go back. He was only a little boy,
not older than you when he came here. And he fought in the battle of
Braddock's defeat. Though the French gained the day it was no great
victory for them, for they gave up their plan of taking possession of
all the country here about. And he has not much faith in the rebels,
as he used to call us, and didn't see what we wanted to fight for. And
he is glad to have me back. But he isn't going to love you any
less."
