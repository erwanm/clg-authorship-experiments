"You can sleep in our barn, if you like. No one goes into it very often,
except myself."

"Thank ye, Buck. I always knowed you'd help me, and that was what I
wanted to see you for."

"Have you anything left for supper?"

"Plenty, Buck. I couldn't eat all you gave me this forenoon."

"I will bring you a good supply in the morning."

I left him, and hastened back to the house. My tyrants had been so busy
in entertaining their distinguished guest that they probably had not
thought of me. The squire was in the parlor with Mrs. Fishley, who was
as lovely as a summer day. She had company, and I was safe enough as
long as the senator remained. My woes would come as soon as he departed;
but I hoped to have the raft ready for a movement by that time.

Supper was not on the table, and I went into the store to see if the
mail was ready. Mr. Barkspear was there, engaged in telling Captain
Fishley that his good-for-nothing "help" had run away and left him.

"Hev you seen anything of Sim Gwynn?" said Mr. Barkspear, turning to me
as I entered the store.

That was a hard question, and I decided not to pay any attention to it.
I asked Ham if the mail was ready to go, and was hastening out to the
barn to harness Darky, when Captain Fishley called me back.

"Are you deaf, Buck?" demanded he, sharply, and with that ugly look he
had worn since our troubles began.

"Not much," I replied.

"Mr. Barkspear asked you if you had seen Sim Gwynn. Why don't you answer
him?"

"I would rather not answer him," I replied; for, whatever other faults I
had, I felt above lying and stealing.
