might almost have been a priest, if priests, as it occurred 
to Vanderbank, were ever such dandies. He had at all 
events, conclusively, doubled the Cape of the years — he 
would never again see fifty-five : to the warning light of 
that bleak headland he presented a back sufficiently con- 
scious. Yet, though, to Vanderbank, he could not look 
young, he came near — strikingly and amusingly — looking 
new : this, after a minute, appeared mainly perhaps in- 
deed in the perfection of his evening dress and the spe- 
cial smartness of the sleeveless overcoat he had evidently 
had made to wear with it and might even actually be 
wearing for the first time. He had talked to Vanderbank 
at Mrs. Brookenham's about Beccles and Suffolk ; but it 
was not at Beccles, nor anywhere in the county, that 
these ornaments had been designed. His action had already been, with howevpr little purpose, to present the 
region to his interlocutor in a favorable light. Vanderbank, for that matter, had the kind of imagination that 
liked to place an object, even to the point of losing sight 
of it in the conditions ; he already saw the nice old nook 
it must have taken to keep a man of intelligence so fresh 
while suffering him to remain so fine. The product of 
Beccles accepted at all events a cigarette — still much as 
a joke and an adventure — and looked about him as if 
even more pleased than he had expected. Then he broke, 
through his double eye-glass, into an exclamation that 
was like a passing pang of envy and regret. " You young 
men, you young men — !" 

'' Well, what about us ?" Vanderbank's tone encour- 
aged the courtesy of the reference. "I'm not so young, 
moreover, as that comes to." 

" How old are you then, prayi?" 

"Why, I'm thirty-four." 

"What do you call that ? I'm a hundred and three" 
Mr. Longdon took out his watch. "It's only a quarter 
past eleven." Then with a quick change of interest, 
"What did you say is your public office ?" he inquired.
