leaned back watching mm.  Their eyes encountered, and they smiled.

"Where are the others, Diana?"

"Jack and Silvette are at the New Theater. Mr. Rivett and Mr. Dineen are

"How does one look wealthy?"

"You always do, Jim."

"Thank fortune for that.  It ought to land me somewhere on the
grandstand."

"Haven’t you noticed," she said, "that some people always look
wealthy?  I don’t know exactly what it is about them; it has nothing to
do with breeding, or clothes, or careful grooming."

"Neither has wealth," he smiled.

"That’s trite; you’re becoming too prosperous to remain clever.  But,
oh, Jim! isn’t it fine!" she exclaimed impulsively.

"What is fine?"

"Why, your success, of course!  Your splendid interest in the
business—your fitting yourself for a position of honor among your peers!
It is fine! fine!  And it is the happiest thing that has ever happened
in my life!"

He looked at her.

"You dear girl," he said quietly.

"I?  It was none of my doing.  You’re mistaken if you think so.  Once

Jim.  You have found yourself; the credit is yours alone."

"I give credit to the far white gods.... In that Olympian Pantheon one
is known as Diana."
