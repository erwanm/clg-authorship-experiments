Faith left the room.

"I fear I have disarranged some of your work."

The doctor examined and set to rights.

"I'll see how you do this evening. What ailed you to pitch into me like
that, Linden?"

"I think the 'pitching in' came upon me," he answered pleasantly.

"It seems so, indeed. I hope you won't try this kind of thing again. I
am sure you won't to-day."

And so the doctor went. A quarter of an hour or a little more had gone
by, when the light knock came at Mr. Linden's door that he had
certainly learned to know by this time; and Faith came in, bearing a
cup of cocoa. The troubled look had not entirely left her face, nor the
changeful colour; but she was not thinking of herself.

"I knew you were tired, Mr. Linden--Would you like this--or some
grapes--or wine--better?"

The most prominent idea in Mr. Linden's mind just then, was that he had
already had what he did not like; but that had no place in the look
which answered her, as he raised himself a little (and but a little) to
take the cup from her hand.

"Pet would thank you better than I can now, Miss Faith."

She stood looking down at him, with a little sorrowing touch about the
lines of her mouth.

"Do you know how much better two cups of cocoa are than one?" said Mr.
Linden.

"I don't know how you can have two at once, Mr. Linden."

"Then I will bestow one upon you--and wait while you get it."
