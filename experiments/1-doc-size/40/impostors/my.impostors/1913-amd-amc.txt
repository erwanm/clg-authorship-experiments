nurse girl. But what can we do? We must 
have someone, and there’s only such a little

Miss Armitage was thinking. 

'Perhaps I might help you out,” she said 
kindly. "There is a young girl with us who 
worked in a factory until she gave out. We 



sent her to the Rest House in the country and

back in the factory. She's a nice pleasant 
girl about seventeen.” 

"Oh, how good of you to think of it! But 
I can't pay high wages, for there'll be her board 
and it won't be hard. When the babies are 
well they are as good as kittens though they 
can't scamper around so much. And they're 
so fat they won't walk very soon. It'll just 
be sitting round and amusing them and looking 
after their food. I couldn't give more than

‘And I should want Marilla as soon as she 
was well enough. You see she's bound-out to

been out in the fresh air most of the time and 
we always tell her to go slow with the babies, 
not rush along in the heat. What did she say?” 

‘'Oh, she hasn't spoken at all. She lies just 
unconscious.”
