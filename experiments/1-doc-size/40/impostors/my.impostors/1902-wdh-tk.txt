be allowed to marry the American, no matter how 
rich he was. She owned that she had not heard of 



 

just such an instance, and he might think her very 
romantic; and perhaps she was; but if the princess 
was an absolute princess, such as she was shown 
in that story, she held that no power on earth could 
keep her from marrying the young American. For 
herself she did not see, though, how the princess 
could be in love with that type of American. If 
she had been in the princess 's place she should have 
fancied something quite different. She made Boyne 
agree with her that Eastern Americans were all, 
more or less, Europeanized, and it stood to reason, 
she held, that a European princess would want some 
thing as un-European as possible if she was falling 
in love to please herself. They had some contention 
upon the point that the princess would want a 
Western American; and then Miss Easmith, with a 
delicate audacity, painted an heroic portrait of 
Boyne himself which he could not recognize openly 
enough to disown; but he perceived resemblances 
in it which went to his head when she demurely 
rose, with a soft " Good-night, Mr. Kenton. I sup 
pose I mustn 't call you Boyne ?" 

" Oh yes, do !" he entreated. " I 'm I 'm not grown 
up yet, you know." 

"Then it will be safe," she sighed. "But I 
should never have thought of that. I had got so 
absorbed in our argument. You are so logical, Mr. 
Kenton Boyne, I mean thank you. You must 
get it from your father. How lovely your sister 
is!"
