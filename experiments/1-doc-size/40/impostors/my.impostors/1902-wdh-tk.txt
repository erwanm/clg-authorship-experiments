talking on foot, and, unlike Lottie 's company, he 
talked to the mother. This had happened before 
from him, but she had not got used to it, and 



 

now she deprecated in everything but words his 
polite questions about her sufferings from the rough 
weather, and his rejoicing that the worst was prob 
ably over. She ventured the hope that it was so, 
for she said that Mr. Kenton had about decided 
to keep on to Holland, and it seemed to her that 
they had had enough of storms. He said he was 
glad that they were going right on; and then 
she modestly recurred to the earlier opinion he had 
given her husband that it would be better to spend 
the rest of the summer in Holland than to go 
to Italy, as if she wished to conform herself in the 
wisdom of Mr. Kenton 's decision. He repeated 
his conviction, and he said that if he were in their 
place he should go to The Hague as soon as they 
had seen Rotterdam, and make it their headquarters 
for the exploration of the whole country. 

"You can 't realize how little it is; you can get 
anywhere in an hour; the difficulty is to keep in 
side of Holland when you leave any given point. 
I envy you going there." 

Mrs. Kenton inferred that he was going to 
stop in France, but if it were part of his close 
ness not to tell, it was part of her pride not to 
ask. She relented when he asked if he might 
get a map of his and prove the littleness of 
Holland from it, and in his absence she could 
not well avoid saying to Ellen, "He seems very 
pleasant."
