gone out?”

“Do you mean that he didn’t propose?”

“Of course not. I proposed to him.”

“What?”

“He was so coy about it, too,” Aurelia, quite as though she were
eating sweetmeats, resumed. “He asked me all about my finances, what
settlements I would make and whether I would object if he kept a
separate establishment. You can’t really fancy how coy he was. He quite
blushed and stammered, the poor thing.”

“I should think he might.”

“Yes, indeed. He asked me if I had spoken to his mamma, and I told
him that while it was perhaps incorrect of me to speak to him in the
first instance, yet that there could be no real love without a mutual
misunderstanding, and now that we had one I would make a formal demand
of the old lady to-day.”

Aurelia, executing a little pas, added: “I have just seen her.”

“Well?”

“She said: ‘And so you want my little boy for your husband.’ Partly
that I told her, but partly also I want you for mother-in-law. You
should have seen her lick her chops over that. Then she asked me about
my affections. I told her they were just like the fashions. They came
and went.”

“She must have been delighted.”

“She hugged me. Then, of course, I asked about him. She told me that he
has just been named as co-respondent in the Kincardine divorce suit,
and I said that that was perfectly satisfactory.”

“What!”
