the Duke's financial affairs were the gossip of Europe, and always had
been since he came of age.

Meanwhile the Doctor reached the end of the chapter, and there was a
pause. Neither spoke, and the silence was becoming awkward, when a
servant came across the lawn announcing the Duke.

"Ask his Grace to come outside," said Margaret, and the representative
of the aristocracy was striding over the green, hat in hand, a moment
afterwards. Margaret put out her hand and Claudius rose. Each felt that
the deus ex machin√¢ had arrived, and that the subject of the yachting
excursion would be immediately broached.

"Immense luck, finding you both," remarked the Duke when he was seated.

"We have been reading. It is so pleasant here," said Margaret, to say
something.

"I have come to thank you for your kind note, Countess. It is extremely
good of you to go in such a party, with your taste for literature and
those sort of things."

"I am sure it is I who ought to thank you, Duke. But when are we to
sail?"

"About the tenth of next month, I should say. Will that be convenient?"

Margaret turned to Claudius.

"Do you think we can finish our book by the tenth, Dr. Claudius?"

"If not," broke in the Duke, "there is no reason why you should not
finish it on board. We shall have lovely weather."

"Oh no!" said Margaret, "we must finish it before we start. I could not
understand a word of it alone."

"Alone?" inquired the Duke. "Ah! I forgot. Thought he had told you. I
have asked Dr. Claudius to give us the pleasure of his company."
