glance. But she would do it! She is capable of doing anything. I went
there hoping she would try to bribe me--good solid capital that would be
in the exposure. Well, my prayer was answered; she did try to bribe me;
and I made the best of a bad bargain and let her. I am checkmated. I
must contrive something fresh to get back to Congress on. Very well; a
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; I will work for the bill--the
incorporatorship will be a very good thing.”

As soon as Mr. Trollop had taken his leave, Laura ran to Senator
Dilworthy and began to speak, but he interrupted her and said
distressfully, without even turning from his writing to look at her:

“Only half an hour! You gave it up early, child. However, it was best,
it was best--I’m sure it was best--and safest.”

“Give it up! I!”

The Senator sprang up, all aglow:

“My child, you can’t mean that you--”

“I’ve made him promise on honor to think about a compromise tonight and
come and tell me his decision in the morning.”

“Good! There’s hope yet that--”

“Nonsense, uncle. I’ve made him engage to let the Tennessee Land bill
utterly alone!”

“Impossible! You--”

“I’ve made him promise to vote with us!”

“INCREDIBLE! Abso--”

“I’ve made him swear that he’ll work for us!”

“PRE - - - POSTEROUS!--Utterly pre--break a window, child, before I
suffocate!”
