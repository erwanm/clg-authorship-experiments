"I hope you will not take offence, Mr. Huxter, if I decline to answer
that question."

"Have you got any money with you?"

"I decline answering."

Mr. Huxter was about to make an angry reply; but a moment's thought led
him to change his purpose. He was anxious to find out how much money
John had.

"Have you got money enough to keep you at the hotel a week?"

"Shall I need to remain here a week?" asked John, a little disturbed
at the thought of having his studies interrupted for so long a time,
especially as there seemed so little prospect of deriving any enjoyment
from his visit.

"Perhaps longer."

"If I don't have money enough, I will write to Mrs. Oakley for more,"
he said.

"I can tell you beforehand that you won't get any."

"We won't dispute about that," said John. "I shall be glad to go about
this business at once, as I do not wish to be kept away from my studies
any longer than is absolutely necessary."

"I'm thinking, young man," said Mr. Huxter, "that it will be a good
while before you go back to your Latin and Greek."

"Why so?" said John.

"Read that, and you'll know," said Mr. Huxter; and he drew a note from
his pocket, and handed it to John.
