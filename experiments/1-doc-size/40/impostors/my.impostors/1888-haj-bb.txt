"I am afraid he was right, Clip," said Bob, shaking his head. "But you
haven't told me about the receipt, Sam."

"He sent me into his room to get his hat, when right down on the floor
by his desk, I saw a piece of paper. I remembered what you told me, Bob,
about the receipt, so I picked it up and slipped it into my pocket. I
had to be quick about it, for Uncle Aaron is always in a hurry. Well, I
took out the hat, and I didn't dare to take out the paper and look at it
till he was out of sight."

"And then--"

"Well, then I saw it was the paper you wanted."

"Mr. Wolverton took it from the pocket of my poor father when he lay
dead on the spot where he was thrown out," said Bob, gravely. "It would
be hard to think of a meaner piece of rascality."

"Well, I'm glad you've got it, Bob. I don't know as I was right in
taking it, but I'll take the risk."

"If you never do anything worse than that, Sam, you won't have much to
answer for. I wish you'd let me give you something."

"No, Bob, you are my friend, and it would be a pity if I couldn't do you
a favor without getting paid for it."

"But this is a great favor. It is worth a hundred and fifty dollars.
Without it we might, and probable would, have to pay the interest money
over again. Now, when your uncle calls for it, we shall only have to
show him the receipt."

"He'll wonder where it came from."

"I hope it won't get you into trouble, Sam."

"He won't suspect me. He'll know I couldn't break into his desk, and he
won't know anything about having dropped it on the floor. I don't see
how he came to be so careless."
