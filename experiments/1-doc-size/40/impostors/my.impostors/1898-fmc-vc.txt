autumn, each terrace was covered with flowers of a 
differeut hue â€” pink and soft yellow and pale blue. 



 

Gilbert had never seen anything made to grow in 
such orderly profusion, and when he reached the top 
by narrow steps built against the wall, he found him- 
self treading on a fine white gravel surface on which 
not even a single dead leaf had been allowed to lie, 
and which extended some thirty yards inwards under 
the trees to a straight bank of moss that had a sheen 
like green velvet where the sun fell upon it through 
the parted leaves overhead. Very far away between 
the trunks of the trees there was the gleam of white 
marble walls. 

Gilbert hesitated a little, and then walked slowly 
forward toward the bank. As yet he had seen no 
trace of any living thing in the garden, but as he 
advanced and changed his position he noticed a small 
dash of colour, like the corner of a dark blue cloak, 
beside the trunk of one of the larger trees. Some one 
was sitting on the other side, and he moved cau- 
tiously and almost noiselessly till he saw that the 
person was a lady, seated on the ground and absorbed 
in a book. He did not remember to have seen more 
than two or three women reading in all his life, 
and one of them was Queen Eleanor; another was 
Beatrix, who, as a lonely child in the solitude 
of her father's castle, had acquired some learning 
from the chaplain, and delighted in spelling out the 
few manuscripts in her father's possession. 

Gilbert Warde was as much a born sportsman as 
he was a fighter, and he had stalked the fallow-deer 
in Stortford woods since he had been old enough to 
draw an arrow's head to his finger.
