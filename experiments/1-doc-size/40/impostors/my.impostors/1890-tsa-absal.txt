ants that we every moment simk deep into their nests 
and progress was most difiicult, we determined to ascend 
the mountains for a little distance in hopes of finding a 
better path and satisfying our curiosity as to the surround- 
 
ing country. This plan d'Allemand did not relish at all 
and he did his best to dissuade us from adopting it ; yet, 
had it not been for a sad accident which we shortly 
met with, and which frustrated our purpose, he would 
hardly have succeeded in altering our fixed determi- 
nation. 
We had already turned our steps in the direction deci- 
ded upon, when in passing by a thinly-clothed tree we 
observed a mass of honey — a bee hive so immense that it

was not to be thought of, as we could not possibly leave 
the sufferer to the mercy of fate, or rather to certain des- 
truction. Nothing was left for us but to place him upon a 
litter of boughs, hastily woven together, and seek the 
 
nearest inhabited place, which our guide assured as we

If this untimely event made us sullen and silent, the 
Frenchman provoked us still more by his ill-timed and
