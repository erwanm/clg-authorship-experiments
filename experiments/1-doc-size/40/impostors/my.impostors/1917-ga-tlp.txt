Madame Waddington, knowing that I was very 
anxious to see one of the cantines at the railway stations about which so much was said, took me late one 
afternoon to St. Lazare. Into this great station, as 
into all the others, train after train hourly gives up 
its load of permissionnaires — men home on their six 
days' leave — ; men for the eclope stations; men from 
shattered regiments, to be held at Le Bourget until 
the time comes to be sent to fill other gaps made by 
the German guns ; men who merely arrive by one train 
to take another out, but who must frequently remain 
for several hours in the depot. 

I have never entered one of these gores to take a 
train that I have not seen hundreds of soldiers entering, leaving, waiting; sometimes lying asleep on the 
hard floor, always on the benches. It is for all who 



 

choose to take advantage of them that these cantines 
are run, and they are open day and night. 

The one in St. Lazare had been organized in Feb- 
ruary, 191 5, by the Baronne de Berckheim (born 
Pourtales) and was still run by her in person when I 
visited it in June, 1916. During that time she and 
her staff had taken care of over two hundred thousand soldiers. From 8 to 11 A. M. cafe-au-lait, or 
cafe noir, or bouillon, pate de foie or cheese is served. 
From 1 1 to 2 and from 6 to 9, bouillon, a plate of meat 
and vegetables, salad, cheese, fruits or compote, coffee, 
a quart of wine or beer, cigarettes. From 2 to 6 and 
after 9 p. m., bouillon, coffee,, tea, pate, cheese, milk, 
lemonade, cocoa. 

The rooms in the station are a donation by the offi- 
cials, of course. The dining-room of the St. Lazare
