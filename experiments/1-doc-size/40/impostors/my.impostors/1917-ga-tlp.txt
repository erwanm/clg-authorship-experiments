themselves exclusively to helping and training their 
own sex. Thousands are at work on the problems of 
higher wage and shorter hours for women of the industrial class, but this problem of the carefully- 
nurtured, wholly untrained, and insecurely protected 
woman they have so far ignored. To my mind this 
demands the first consideration and the application of 
composite woman's highest intelligence. The indus- 
trial woman has been trained to work, she learns as 
she grows to maturity to protect herself and fight her 
own battles, and in nine cases out of ten she resents 
the interference of the leisure class in her affairs as 
much as she would charity. The leaders of every 
class should be its own strong spirits. And the term 
"class consciousness" was not invented by fashionable 
society. 

There is another problem that women, forced imminently or prospectively to support themselves, must 
face before long, and that is the heavy immigration 
from Europe. Of course some of those competent 
women over there will keep the men's jobs they hold 
now, and among the widows and the fatherless there 
will be a large number of clerks and agriculturists. 
But many reformes will be able to fill those positions 
satisfactorily, and, when sentiment has subsided, 
young women at least (who are also excellent workers) will begin to think of husbands; and, unless the 
war goes on for many years and reduces our always 
available crop, American girls of the working class 
will have to look to their laurels both ways. 



 
Here is the reverse of the picture, which possibly 
may save the too prosperous and tempting United 
States from what in the end could not fail to be a 
further demoralization of her ancient ideals and 
depletion of the old American stock : 

No matter how many men are killed in a war there 
are more males when peace is declared than the dead
