“It would do no good to mention it,” she replied, mournfully. “It
has cost me a painful effort to come to you; and now that my hope has
proved, alas! in vain, I must beg the privilege of still remaining a
stranger.”

She arose, as she said this. Her figure was tall and dignified. Dropping
me a slight courtesy, she was turning to go away, when I said,

“But, madam, even if I have not the ability to grant your request, I may
still have it in my power to aid you in this matter. I am ready to do
all I can; and, without doubt, among the friends of your husband will be
found numbers to step forward and join in affording you the assistance
so much desired, when they are made aware of your present extremity.”

The lady made an impatient gesture, as if my words were felt as a
mockery or an insult, and turning from me, again walked from the room
with a firm step. Before I could recover myself, she had passed into the
street, and I was left standing alone. To this day I have remained in
ignorance of her identity. Cheerfully would I have aided her to the
extent of my ability to do so. Her story touched my feelings and
awakened my liveliest sympathies, and if, on learning her name and
making proper inquiries into her circumstances, I had found all to be
as she had stated, I would have felt it a duty to interest myself in her
behalf, and have contributed in aid of the desired end to the extent of
my ability. But she came to me under the false idea that I had but to
put my hand in my pocket, or write a check upon the bank, and lo! a
thousand dollars were forthcoming. And because I did not do this,
she believed me unfeeling, selfish, and turned from me mortified,
disappointed, and despairing.

I felt sad for weeks after this painful interview. On the very next
morning I received a letter from an artist, in which he spoke of the
extremity of his circumstances, and begged me to purchase a couple of
pictures. I called at his rooms, for I could not resist his appeal. The
pictures did not strike me as possessing much artistic value.

“What do you ask for them?” I inquired.

“I refused a hundred dollars for the pair. But I am compelled to part
with them now, and you shall have them for eighty.”
