that. But I've no doubt it was welcome." Matt fretted in silence, but he
allowed his mother to go on. "She is a very proud girl, and I've no
doubt that what she's been through has intensified her pride."

"I don't suppose she's perfect," said Matt. "I'm not perfect, myself.
But I don't conceal her faults from myself any more than I do my own. I
know she's proud. I don't admire pride; but I suppose that with her it
can't be helped."

"I don't know that I object to it," said Mrs. Hilary. "It doesn't always
imply hardness; it goes with very good things, sometimes. That hauteur
of hers is very effective. I've seen it carry her through with people
who might have been disposed to look down on her for some reasons."

"I shouldn't value it, for that," Matt interrupted.

"No. But she made it serve her instead of her want of those family
connections that every one else has--"

"She will have all of ours, I hope, mother!" Matt broke in, with a
smile; but his mother would not be diverted from the point she was
making.

"And that it always seemed so odd she shouldn't have. I'm sure that to
see her come into a room, you would think half Boston, or all the
princes of the blood, were her cousins. She's certainly a magnificent
creature."

Matt differed with his mother from the ground up, in all her worldly
reasons for admiring Suzette, but her praises filled his heart to
overflowing. Tears stood in his eyes, and his voice trembled:

"She is--she is--angelically!"

"Well, not just that type, perhaps," said Mrs. Hilary. "But she is a
good girl. No one can help respecting her; and I think she's even more
to be respected for yielding to that poor old maid sister of hers about
their property, than for wishing to give it up."

"Yes," Matt breathed gratefully.
