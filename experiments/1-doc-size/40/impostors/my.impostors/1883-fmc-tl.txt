sorry I disturbed you. Pray forgive me."

"Not at all,--churches are free for every one. But why do you laugh?"

"At my own stupidity," he answered. "I might have known that when you go
to church at odd times you go to be alone, and not to have wandering
callers sent there after you."

"What makes you think that?" she asked, curious to know how much he had
noticed. She argued that if he had heard her crying he would think the
question natural, whereas, if he had not, he would not suspect anything
from it.

"Because you acted as though you thought you were alone," he said
seriously.

"I did think so," she said, blushing faintly. "Do you know? I was quite
startled when I saw you there."

"I saw you were," he answered, still very gravely, "and I am very
sorry."

"Do you remember what I said to you at Castellamare, Mr. Batiscombe?"

"Yes; you said that life was not all roses, and you said it in earnest."

"Yes," said Leonora. "You see I did. I am not always in earnest."

"Is it rude to ask how one distinguishes between your excellency in
earnest and your excellency in fun?" inquired Batiscombe, glad enough to
turn the conversation to a jest, for he judged Leonora to be rather
imprudent. Indeed, he wondered how she could have said what she had,
unless it were from a wish to face out the situation.

"You ought to be able to see," she answered, laughing lightly, "but when
you cannot, perhaps I will tell you."

"Pray do," said he. "I am very stupid about such things,--but then, I am
always in earnest, even when I want to be funny. Perhaps you might think
me most diverting when I am most in earnest."
