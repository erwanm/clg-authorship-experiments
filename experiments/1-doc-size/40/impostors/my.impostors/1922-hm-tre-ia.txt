Ah Cum got out his black-bordered card and 
oflFered it. 
''Aw Come. That sounds kind of funny ' said 
O'Higgins. Smiling, the Chinaman gave the correct pronunciation. "I see. Ah Coom. What's 
the idea of the black border?" 
"My father recently died, sir.'' 
"But that style isn't Oriental." 
"I was educated in America." 
"Where?" 
"At Yale." 
"Well, well! This part of the world is jammed 
full of surprises. I met a Hindu a few weeks ago 
who was a Harvard man." 
"Will you be taking a pole-chair?" 
"If that's the racket. I naturally want to do 
it up in proper style." 
"Very well, sir. I'll be outside the hotel at 
nine-thirty." 
Ten minutes' walk brought them to the hotel. 
As O'Higgins signed the hotel raster, his keen 
glance took in the latest signatures. 
"Anywhere," he said in answer to the manager's 
query. "I'm not particular about rooms. Where's 
the dining room? And, say, can I have some 
eggs? This jam-tea breakfast gets my goat." 
"Come this way, Mr. O'Higgins," said the manager, amusedly. 
O'Higgins followed him into the dining room. 
That raster would be easy to get at; comforting 
thought. It did not matter in the least what name 
 
the young fellow was travelling under; all James 
Boyle O'Higgins wanted was the letter H. There 
 ras something fatalistic about the letter H. The 
individual twist was always there, even in the 
cleverest forgeries. 
The eggs were all right, but nobody in this part 
of the world had the least conception of what the 
coffee bean was for. Always as black and bitter 
as gall. Coffee k la Turque wasn't so bad; but a 
guy couldn't soak his breakfast toast in it.
