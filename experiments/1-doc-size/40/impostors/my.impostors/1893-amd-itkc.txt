fields. He had a mind to start this morning, but 
I said, 'Wait, and I will go with you this after- 
noon.' The old place has had a great shaking up. 
Of course you know about it .^ " 

" Oh, yes," Sabrina answered. 

"They came in to see your uncle. A syndicate 
â€” everything is a syndicate now, if it only wants 
to buy a city lot." 

" Some parties came to see me." 

Mrs. Vantine raised her brows. It was an ar- 





tide of her creed that a young woman could know 
nothing of business. 

" Of course you referred them to Mr. Vantine?" 

" I had not decided about giving up the place,' 
Sabrina answered slowly. 

" You didn't hold out any hopes, or allow your- 
self to be drawn into any promises ? These peo- 
ple are not the ones who have set about building 
up the town. They are outside parties, dealing in 
futures, who mean to bring the property into the 
market after the town is really built. Your uncle 
is shrewd enough to play one off against the other. 
If they miss it, why it's their lookout ; and if they 
have to hold the property twelve or fifteen years, 
that is their business also, with taxes and interest 
eating it up." 

Mrs. Vantine nodded with confident sagacity.
