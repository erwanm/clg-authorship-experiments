was always wanting to hear what was going on at 
Chester House. Miss Disbrowe was so different 
from anything he had imagined one of your reli- 
gious women to be. For that matter, so was Olm- 
stead. Perhaps he, Winchester, had never been 





very clear as to what really constituted religion, 
esteeming it as something to be sneered at as 
occasion offered. 

For six weeks he had lain here most of the 
time, one week on the farthest verge of human 
life. He had come back weak and confused be- 
cause of a dislocated shoulder, a broken leg, sun- 
dry wounds and bruises, besides a concussion of 
the brain, the most serious thing at first. 

Wild stories had been afloat. All that was 
known of a certainty was Winchester's sudden 
rush to the drying-room up-stairs, and his com- 
mand to the half-dozen men employed to fly for 
their lives. Then he had gone to alarm two 
others in a sort of wing, and here the crash had 
caught them. The men were but little injured, a 
fall having saved them, but Winchester had been 
buried in the ruins. 

At first, foul play was suspected on the part of 
the disaffected workmen, two of whom had uttered 
threats. The explosion was a mystery. The in- 
vestigation proved the machinery trustworthy ; 
but the ruin and the fire afterward kept the secret 
from prying eyes. There seemed sufficient proof 
to commit the two ringleaders, who had made 
themselves notorious in other ways.
