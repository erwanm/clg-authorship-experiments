second course of little Bilham and had said to Strether  
the previous afternoon, on his leaving them, that, since her ' 
impression was to be renewed, she would reserve judg- '

The new evidence was to come, as it proved, in a day 
or two. He soon had from Maria a message to the effect 
that an excellent box at the " Fran ais " had been lent her   
for the following night ; it seeming on such occasions not 
the least of her merits that she was subject to such approaches. The sense of how she was, in advance, always
