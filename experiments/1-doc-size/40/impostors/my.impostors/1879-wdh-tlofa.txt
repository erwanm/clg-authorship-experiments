" Oh, well, don't say it ! " he pleaded ; " or don't 
say it now, — not till you 've forgiven me for the 
anxiety I 've caused you ; not till you 've praised 
me for trying to do what I thought the right thing. 
You can't imagine how hard it was for one who 
hasn 't the habit ! " 
" I do praise you for it. There 's nothing to for- 
give you ; but I can't let you care for me unless I 
know — unless " — She stopped, and then, " Mr. 
Staniford," she began firmly, "since I came here, 
I've been learning things that I didn't know be- 
fore. They have changed the whole world to me, 
and it can never be the same again." 
" I 'm sorry for that ; but if they haven 't 
changed you, the world may go." 
" No, not if we 're to live in it," answered the 
girl, with the soberer wisdom women keep at such 
times. " It will have to be known how we met. 
What will people say ? They will laugh." 
" I don't think they will in my presence," said 
Staniford, with swelling nostrils. " They may use 
their pleasure elsewhere." 
 
" And I shouldn 't care for their laughing, either,'' 
said Lydia. " But oh, why did you come ? " 
" Why did I come ? " 
" Was it because you felt bound by anything 
that 's happened, and you wouldn 't let me bear the 
laugh alone ? I 'm not afraid for myself. I shall 
never blame you. You can go perfectly free." 
" But I don't want to go free ! " 
Lydia looked at him with piercing earnestness. 
"Do you think I 'm proud ? " she asked. 
" Yes, I think you are," said Staniford, vaguely. 
" It isn 't for myself that I should be proud with 
other people. But I would rather die than bring 
ridicule upon one I — upon you." 
"I can believe that," said Staniford, devoutly, 
and patiently reverencing the delay of her scru- 
ples.
