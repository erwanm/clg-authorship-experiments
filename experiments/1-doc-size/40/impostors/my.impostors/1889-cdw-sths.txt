cabinet disallowed the appointment of two provincial judges made by the
Quebec premier.

The Dominion has another power unknown to our Constitution; that is,
disallowance or veto of provincial acts. This power is regarded with
great jealousy by the provinces. It is claimed by one party that it
should only be exercised on the ground of unconstitutionality; by
the other, that it may be exercised in the interest of the Dominion
generally. As a matter of fact it has been sometimes exercised in cases
that the special province felt to be an interference with its rights.

Another cause of friction, aggravated by the power of disallowance, has
arisen from conflict in jurisdiction as to railways. Both the Dominion
and the provinces may charter and build railways. But the British Act
forbids the province to legislate as to lines of steam or other ships,
railways, canals, and telegraphs connecting the province with any other
province, or extending beyond its limits, or any such work actually
within the limits which the Canadian Parliament may declare for the
general advantage of Canada; that is, declare it to be a Dominion work.
A promoter, therefore, cannot tell with any certainty what a charter is
worth, or who will have jurisdiction over it. The trouble in Manitoba
in the fall of 1888 between the province and the Canadian Pacific road
(which is a Dominion road in the meaning of the Act) could scarcely
have arisen if the definition of Dominion and provincial rights had been
clearer.

But a more serious cause of weakness to the provinces and embarrassment
to the Dominion is in the provincial subsidies. When the present
confederation was formed the Dominion took on the provincial debts up
to a certain amount. It also agreed to pay annually to each province, in
half-yearly payments, a subsidy. By the British Act this annual payment
was $80,000 to Ontario, $70,000 to Quebec, $60,000 to Nova Scotia,
$50,000 to New Brunswick, with something additional to the last two. In
1886-87 the subsidies paid to all the provinces amounted to $4,169,341.
This is as if the United States should undertake to raise a fixed
revenue to distribute among the Statesâ€”a proceeding alien to our ideas
of the true function of the General Government, and certain to lead to
State demoralization, and tending directly to undermine its self-support
and dignity. It is an idea quite foreign to the conception of political
economy that it is best for people to earn what they spend, and only
