at first, then higher and higher, till it stood like a 
blazing spear-head in the midst, emitting a calm, 



 

white effulgence that darkened the lamps overhead, 
and shed an unearthly whiteness on Zoroaster's white 
face. 

He stepped back from the altar, and a low murmur 
of astonishment rose from all the crowd of white- 
robed men. Darius stood in silent wonder, gazing 
alternately upon the figure of Zoroaster, and upon 
the fragments of his good sword that lay scattered 
upon the pavement. 

Zoroaster looked round upon the faces of the priests 
with blazing eyes : 

" If ye be true priests of Ahura Mazda, raise with 
me the hymn of praise," he said. " Let it be heard 
in the heavens, and let it echo beyond the spheres ! " 

Then his voice rose calm and clear above all the 
others, and lifting up his eyes and hands, he intoned 
the solemn chant ; 

"^e, who hy truth ruleth in purity^ ahideth accord- 
ing to the will of the Lord. 

" The Lord All- Wise is the giver of gifts to men for 
the ivorks which men in the world shall do in the truth 
of the Lord, 

" He who protecteth the poor giveth the kingdom to 
aod. 

" Best of all earthly goods is truth.
