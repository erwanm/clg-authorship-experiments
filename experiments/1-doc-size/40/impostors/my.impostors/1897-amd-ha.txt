am going to choose a ' bonnie wee thing,' like the 
wife in the song." 
Hanny flushed rosy red. Oh, why would people 
talk about being married, and all that? And if 
Peter wouldn't look at her in just that way! It 
gave her a touch of embarrassment. 
But oh, they had a splendid time ! Modern 
young people would have been borecl, and voted it 
" no spread at all." They played Proverbs, and 
What is my thought like? and everybody tried to 
bring out their very best, and be as bright and 
witty and joyous as possible. They had plain 
cake and fancy cake, and a new kind of dainty 
crisp crackers ; candies, nuts, raisins, and mottoes, 
which were the greatest fun of all. Afterward, 
some dancing with the Cheat quadrille, and it was 
so amusing to " cut out," or run away and leave 
your partner with his open arms, and a blank look 
of surprise on his face. 
Doctor Joe came to take the little girl home; for 
he was quite sure Jim would want to take some 
one else's sister. 
"Aunt Dolly," said Peter, when he was going 
away without any girl at all, though he had hoped 
to walk home with Hanny, " isn't Nan Underbill 
just the sweetest little thing in the world? I don't 
wonder grandfather liked her so. With that soft, 
indescribable hair, and her eyes, - - twilight eyes, 
some one put in a poem, --and that cunning 
dimple when she smiles, and so dainty altogether. 
What made you say she was not pretty? ' 
" Why, I said, she was not as handsome as Mrs. 
Hoffman." 
" She suits me ten times better. She is like this, 
" ' A creature not too bright or good 
For human nature's daily food.' ' 
Dolly repeated the talk and the verses to Stephen. 
" And Peter is such a solid, steady-going fellow. 
He was really smitten." 
" The idea ! And with that child ! "
