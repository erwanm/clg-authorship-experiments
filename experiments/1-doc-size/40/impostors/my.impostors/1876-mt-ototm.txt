When the river is very low, and one's steamboat 
is " drawing all the water " there is in the channel, 
— or a few inches more, as was often the case in 
the old times, — one must be painfully circumspect 
in his piloting. We used to have to " sound " a 
number of particularly bad places almost every 
trip when the river was at a very low stage. 

Sounding is done in this way. The boat ties up 
at the shore, just above the shoal crossing; the 
pilot not on watch takes his " cub " or steersman 
and a picked crew of men (sometimes an officer 
also), and goes out in the yawl — provided the boat 
has not that rare and sumi)tuous luxury, a regularly- 
devised " sou.nding-boat " — and proceeds to hunt for 
the best water, the pilot on duty watching his 
movements through a spy-glass, meantime, and in 
some instances assisting by signals of the boat's 
whistle, signifying " try liigher up " or " try lower 
down ;" for the surface of the water, lilce an oil- 
painting, is more exproasive and intelligible when 
inspected from a little distance than very close at 
hand. The whistle signals are seldom necessary, 
however ; never, perhaps, except when the wind 
confuses the significant ripples upon the water's 
surface. When the yawl has reached the shoal 
place, the speed is slackened, the pilot begins to 
sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long, 
and the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to 
" hold her up to starboard ;" or "let her fall to lar- 
board ;"' or " steady — steady as you go." 

When the measurements indicate that the yawl 
is approaching the shoalest part of the reef, the 
command is given to " ease all !" Then the men 
stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the current. 
The next order is, " Stand by with the buoy !" 
The moment the shallowest point is reached 
the pilot delivers the order, " Let go the buoy !"
