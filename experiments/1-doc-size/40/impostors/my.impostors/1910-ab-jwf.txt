them, their loneliness of kin, the sin of one was the other's 
sin also, and they must stand or fall together. 

"And what about?" said Celia, in scorn. "An ear- 
trumpet ! I said I hadn't it when I had. An ear-trumpet 
was not to be found for half an hour when nobody particu- 
larly wanted it, and I was asked if I had it, and I said 
no." 

In the confusion of her mind, the strain of her anger, 
and because she needed food, it was all unmeasured folly 
to her. It seemed foolish that Tim had wanted it, foolish 
in her to have taken it for him, to have denied she had it. 
The thought uppermost in her mind was that Tim was a 
fool, and he had been allowed by a silly destiny to bring 
about this upheaval. She was angry to the bottom of her 
consciousness. That she could not altogether have ex- 
plained. But the world seemed now her enemy. Bess was 
speaking at last. She had thought of some things so long 
that now they came fluently.

understand and she need not say it. 

" Why, we owe them everything," she said. " They 
brought you up." 

Celia's face seemed to harden again.
