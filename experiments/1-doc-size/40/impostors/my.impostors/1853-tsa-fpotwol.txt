"Very good, I should certainly think, to make such a wonderful
discovery."
"Seriously, though, Mr. Fenwick, do you not think Mary Lester a very
sweet girl?"
"Certainly I do."
"And just such a one as you could love?"
"Any one, it seems to me, might love Mary Lester; but then, it is
just as apparent that she could not love any one who might chance to
offer."
"Of course not. And I should be very sorry to think that she could.
But of one thing I am certain, she cannot look upon you with
unfavourable eyes."
"Mrs. Martindale!"
"I am in earnest, Mr. Fenwick."
"What reason have you for thinking so?"
"Very good reason. I had my eyes on you both at Mrs. Allenson's
party, and I saw as plain as could be that Mary was deeply
interested. Since then, I have met her, and observed her eye
brighten and her cheek kindle at the mention of your name. Mr.
Fenwick, she is a prize well worth winning, and may be yours."
"Are you, then, really serious?" the young man now said, his tone
and manner changing.
"Assuredly I am, Mr. Fenwick."
"Mary Lester, you know, moves in a circle above my own; that is, her
father is accounted rich, and I am known to have nothing but my own
energies to depend upon."
"All that is nothing. Win her affections, and she must be yours."
"But I am not so certain that I can do that."
"Nonsense! It is half done already."
"You seem very positive about the matter."
"Because I am never mistaken on these subjects. I can tell, the
moment I see a young couple together, whether they will suit each
other or not."
"And you think, then, that we will just suit?"
"Certainly I do."
"I only wish that I could think so."
"Do you, indeed? I am glad to hear you say that. I thought you could
not be insensible to the charms of so sweet a girl."
"Do you, then, really believe that if I offered myself to Mary
Lester, she would accept me?"
