"Because," answered Kitty, between laughing and crying, "it isn't a
story, and I don't know whether I like him."

"But do you think you might get to like him?"

"I don't know. His asking brings back all the doubts I ever had of him,
and that I've been forgetting the past two weeks. I can't tell whether I
like him or not. If I did, shouldn't I trust him more?"

"Well, whether you are in love or not, I'll tell you what you are,
Kitty," cried Mrs. Ellison, provoked with her indecision, and yet
relieved that the worst, whatever it was, was postponed thereby for a
day or two.

"What!"

"You're--"

But at this important juncture the colonel came lounging in, and Kitty
glided out of the room.

"Richard," said Mrs. Ellison, seriously, and in a tone implying that it
was the colonel's fault, as usual, "you know what has happened, I
suppose."

"No, my dear, I don't; but no matter: I will presently, I dare say."

"O, I wish for once you wouldn't be so flippant. Mr. Arbuton has offered
himself to Kitty."

Colonel Ellison gave a quick, sharp whistle of amazement, but trusted
himself to nothing more articulate.

"Yes," said his wife, responding to the whistle, "and it makes me
perfectly wretched."

"Why, I thought you liked him."

"I didn't like him; but I thought it would be an excellent thing for
Kitty."
