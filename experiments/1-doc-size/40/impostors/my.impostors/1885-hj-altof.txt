that can do nothing great. Of this Roman rigidity 
the Pont du Card is an admirable example. It would 
be a great injustice, however, not to insist upon its 
beauty, a kind of manly beauty, that of an object 
constructed not to please but to serve, and impressive 
simply from the scale on which it carries out this 
intention. The number of arches in each tier is dif 
ferent; they are smaller and more numerous as they 
ascend. The preservation of the thing is extra 
ordinary; nothing has crumbled or collapsed; every 
feature remains; and the huge blocks of stone, of a 
brownish-yellow (as if they had been baked by the 
Proven gal sun for eighteen centuries), pile themselves, 
without mortar or cement, as evenly as the day they 



were laid together. All this to carry the water of a 
couple of springs to a little provincial city! The con 
duit on the top has retained its shape and traces of 
the cement with which it was lined. When the vague 
twilight began to gather, the lonely valley seemed to 
fill itself with the shadow of the Roman name, as if 
the mighty empire were still as erect as the supports 
of the aqueduct; and it was open to a solitary tourist, 
sitting there sentimental, to believe that no people has 
ever been, or will ever be, as great as that, measured, 
as we measure the greatness of an individual, by the 
push they gave to what they undertook. The Pont du 
Gard is one of the three or four deepest impressions 
they have left; it speaks of them in a manner with 
which they might have been satisfied. 

I feel as if it were scarcely discreet to indicate the 
whereabouts of the chateau of the obliging young 
man I had met on the way from Nimes; I must con 
tent myself with saying that it nestled in an en 
chanting valley, dans le fond, as they say in France, 
and that I took my course thither on foot, after 
leaving the Pont du Gard. I find it noted in my
