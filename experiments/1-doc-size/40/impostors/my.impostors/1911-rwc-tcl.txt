"Yes, Harry."

"Rot! Why don't you go and talk to her?"

"Because if I remain invisible she might possibly forget my face. I
stand a better chance by letter, Harry."

"Now you're not bad-looking," insisted Annan, kindly. "And besides, a
man's face doesn't count with a girl. Half of 'em are neurotics, anyway,
and they adore the bizarre--"

"Damn it," snapped Sam, "do you mean that my countenance resembles a
gargoyle? If you do, say so in English."

"No, no, no," said Annan soothingly,--"I've seen more awful
mugs--married mugs, too. What woman has done woman may do again. Buck
up! Beauty and the beast is no idle jest--"

"I'll punch you good and plenty," began Sam wrathfully, but Annan fled,
weak with laughter.

"There's no vainer man than an ugly one!" he called back, and slammed
the door to escape a flight of paint brushes hurled by a maddened man.

"I'll go! By jinks, I'll go, anyway!" he exclaimed; "and I don't care
what she thinks of my face ... only I think I'll take Annan with
me--just for company--or--dummy bridge on the way up.... Harry!" he
shouted.

Annan cautiously appeared, ready for rapid flight.

"Aw come on in! My face suits me. Besides, thank Heaven I've got a
reputation back of it; but yours breaks the speed laws. Will you go up
there with me--like a man?"

"Where?"

"To Estwich?"

"When?" inquired Annan, sceptically.
