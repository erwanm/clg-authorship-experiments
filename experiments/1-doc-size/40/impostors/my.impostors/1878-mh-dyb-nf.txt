QUICK SOUP.
2 lbs. of raw lean beef, chopped very fine; 3 pints of boiling water
in which an onion, a turnip, and a carrot—all pared and sliced—have
been boiled twenty minutes; pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of tomato
catsup.
Put the beef into a tin pail and set in cold water. Bring this slowly
to a boil, then pour in the boiling water upon the smoking hot meat
inside. Cover closely, boil for half an hour in the hot water; turn
into a saucepan; season, simmer ten minutes, strain, pressing and
wringing the meat, and pour into the tureen.
DIJON PATÉ.
1 large cup of cold boiled rice; 2 raw eggs; ½ cup of milk; 2 cups of
minced veal; ½ cupful of gravy or drawn butter; 4 hard boiled eggs,
sliced; pepper and salt.
Butter a pudding-mould—one without a cylinder—and line it with a thick
coating of the rice worked to a paste with the milk and beaten eggs,
and seasoned with pepper and salt. The paste should be quite stiff.
Line the inside of this in turn with the sliced eggs, and within
this pack the minced veal, wet with gravy and seasoned to taste. The
stuffing of the fillet of veal should be chopped with the meat. Cover
with rice; put on the lid of the mould; set it in boiling water and
cook one hour. Turn out carefully, and serve with a good gravy in a
boat. The gravy, if you have no other, can be made of odds-and-ends
of the veal boiled down in water. Or a cup of your tomato soup of
yesterday will make a good sauce.
