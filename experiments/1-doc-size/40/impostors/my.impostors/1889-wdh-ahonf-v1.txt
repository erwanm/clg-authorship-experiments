ain't a-going to give the public any rest at all. 
Sometimes we 're going to have a delicate little 
landscape like this, and sometimes we're going to 
have an indelicate little figure, or as much so as the 
law AA'ill allow." 
 
The young man leaning against the mantcl])iece

Fulkerson looked up gaily at Mr. Dryfoos, who 
smiled deprecatingly. 
 
"It was different," March went on, "when the
