ragged old stove-pipe stickin' up out of the ground, 
and blazing away like forty, and a fellow jiloughing 
all round it and not minding it any more than if it 
was spring violets. Horses didn't notice it, either. 
Well, they 've always known about the gas out there ; 
thoy say there are places in the woods whoreit's 
been burning ever since the country was settled. 

" But when \ on come in sight of Moffitt — my, oh 
my ! Well, you come in smell of it about as soon. 
That gas out there ain't odourless, like the Pittsburg 
gas, and so it 's perfectly safe ; but the smell isn't 
bad — about as bad as the finest kind of benzine. 
Well, the first thing that strikes you when you 
come to Moffitt is the notion that there has been a 
good warm, growing rain, and the town's come up 
overnight. That 's in the suburbs, the annexes, and 
additions. But it ain't shabby — no shanty-town 
business ; nice brick and frame houses, some of 'em 
Queen Anne style, and all of 'cm looking as if they 
had come to stay. And whcn you drive up from 
the depot you think everybody 's moving. Every- 
thing seems to be piled into the street ; old houses 
made over, and new ones going up everywhere. You 
know the kind of street Main Street always used to 
be in our section — half plank-road and turnpike, and 
the rest mud-hole, and a lot of stores and doggeries 
strung along with false fronts a story higher than 
the back, and here and there a decent building with 
the gable end to the public; and a court-house and 



 

jail and two taverns and three or four churches. 
Well, they 're all there in Moffitt yet, but architecture 
has struck it hard, and they 've got a lot of new 
huildings that needn't be ashamed of themselves 
anywhere ; the new court-house is as big as St.
