"I--I didn't do it. I tell you I didn't do it. It was somebody else."

Mark and the officers looked at each other significantly. The drunken
man had unintentionally given himself away. Just then his glance fell on
Mark.

"It's the kid," he said. "What's all this mean, kid?"

"I'll tell you, Mr. Minton. Your aunt, Mrs. Mack, has been attacked and
robbed."

"Is she--dead?" asked Jack eagerly.

"No."

"She is my aunt. If she dies I'll get all her money. Take me to a good
hotel. I'm sleepy."

It was clear that Jack did not fully realize the situation. Next
morning, however, when the two New York officers arrived, he realized it
fully, and charged Mark with betraying him. They went to New York in the
same train, Jack wearing handcuffs.

telegraph boy opened the door of their humble apartment.

"Then you have missed me?" said Mark smiling.

"It has seemed a long time since you went away. Did you have a
successful trip?"
