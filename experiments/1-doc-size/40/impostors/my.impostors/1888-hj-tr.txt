ments. It was present to her as an agreeable nega 
tive, I must add, that her father and sister took no 
strenuous view of her responsibility or of their own : 
they neither brought the matter up to her as a crime 
nor made her worse through her feeling that they 
hovered about in tacit disapproval. There was a 
pleasant, cheerful helplessness in her father in regard 





to this as in regard to everything else. There could

to illustrate the fact that for these candid minds the 
newspapers and all they contained were a part of 
the general fatality of things, of the recurrent fresh 
ness of the universe, coming out like the sun in 
the morning or the stars at night. The thing that 
worried Francie most while Delia kept her in bed 
was the apprehension of what her father might 
do : but this was not a fear of what he might do 
to Mr. Flack. He would go round perhaps to Mr. 
Probert s or to Mme. de Brecourt s to reprimand 
them for having made things so rough for his 
" chicken." It was true she had scarcely ever seen 
him reprimand any one for anything ; but on the 
other hand nothing like that had ever happened 
before to her or to Delia. They had made each 
other cry once or twice but no one else had ever 
made them, and no one had ever broken out on 
them that way and frightened them half to death. 
Francie wanted her father not to go round; she 
had a sense that those other people had somehow 
stores of censure, of superiority in any discussion, 
which he could not command. She wanted nothing 
done and no communication to pass only a 
proud, unbickering silence on the part of the 
Dossons. If the Proberts made a noise and they
