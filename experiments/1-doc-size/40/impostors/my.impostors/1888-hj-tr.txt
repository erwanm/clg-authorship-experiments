against his own flesh and blood. Every now and 
then he broke out "And if you see her as she 





looks just now (she s too lovely too touching !) 
you would see how right I was originally when 
I found in her such a revelation of that type, 
the French Renaissance, you know, the one we 
talked about." But he reverted with at least 
equal frequency to the idea that he seemed 
unable to throw off, that it was like something 
done on purpose, with a refinement of cruelty ; 
such an accident to them, of all people on earth, 
the very last, the very last, those who he verily 
believed would feel it more than any family in 
the world. When Waterlow asked what made 
them so exceptionally ticklish he could only say 
that they just happened to be so ; it was his father s 
influence, his very genius, the worship of privacy 
and good manners, a hatred of all the new 
familiarities and profanations. The artist in 
quired further, at last, rather wearily, what in 
two words was the practical question his friend 
desired that he should consider. Whether he 
should be justified in throwing over Miss Francina 
was that it ? 

" Oh heavens, no ! For what sneak do you take 
me ? She made a mistake, but any one might do 
that. It s whether it strikes you that I should be 
justified in throwing them over." 

"It depends upon the sense you attach to 
justification." 

"I mean should I be miserably unhappy 
would it be in their power to make me so ? "
