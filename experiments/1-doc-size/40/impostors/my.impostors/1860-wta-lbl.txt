" That's just what I mean to do. Little by 
little - that's my motto ; and if I can only get 
hold any where, you may leave the rest to me." 

" You are a good boy, Paul, and you will suc- 
ceed by and by," said Mrs. Duncan, -proudly. "I 
expect to get some work myself next week, and 
I have no doubt we shall do very well." 




'' What work, mother ? " asked Paul, a shadow 
of dissatisfaction passing over his face. 

" Captain Littleton thought he could get me a 
chance to make bags for the flour mills." 

" I don't mean to have you take in work, 
mother. You have enough to do to take care of 
the house and the children." 

"I can- do a good deal besides. Sarah can 
help a great deal about the house, and with what 
we can all do, we shall get along very well in- 
deed. We ought to be very thankful for all the 
blessings that surround us." 

'' We are enough sight better off than I thought," 
replied Paul; "but I don't want to have you 
make a slave of yourself. You used to ' work 
hard enough ; and now, if you are going to take in 
work, you will wear yourself out in a few years." 

" I guess not, Paul. There is somebody knock- 
ing at the door ; go and see who it is." 

Paul went to the door, and the visitor proved 
to be Captain Littleton.
