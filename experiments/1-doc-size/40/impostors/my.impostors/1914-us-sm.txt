would he say?" 



 



 

Sylvia's name went upon our letter-heads and 
other literature; and almost at once things began 
to happen. In a day or two there came a reporter, 
saying he had noticed her name. Was it true that 
she had become interested in our work? Would I 
please give him some particulars, as the public 
would naturally want to know. 

I admitted that Mrs. van Tuiver had joined 
the committee; she approved of our work and 
desired to further it. That was all. He asked, 
would she give an iaterview? And I answered 
that I was siu"e she would not. Then would I 
tell something about how she had come to be in- 
terested in the work? It was a chance to assist 
OUT propaganda, added the reporter, diplo- 
matically. 

I retired to another room, and got Sylvia upon 
the phone. "The time has come for you to take 
the plunge," I said. 

"Oh, but I don't want to be in the papers!" 
she cried. "Surely you wouldn't advise it!" 

"I don't see how you can avoid having some- 
thing appear. Your name is given out, and if 
the man can't get anything else, he'll take our 
literature, and write up your doings out of his 
imagination."
