horse-car will serve your purpose. At nearly every 
corner of the street up which it climbs stands an 
experienced suburban, who darts out upon the car, 
and seizes a vacant place in it. Presently all the 
places are taken, and before we reach Temple Street, 
where helpless groups of women are gathered to 
avail themselves of the first seats vacated, an alert 
citizen is stationed before each passenger who is to

indecently crowded, but that in the centre of the car 
are two adopted citizens, far gone in drink, who have 
the aspect and the smell of having passed the day in 
an ash-heap. These citizens being quite helpless
