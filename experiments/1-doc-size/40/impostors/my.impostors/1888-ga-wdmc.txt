depths she would find rest at last. How would 
she look down there, in some quiet cave, with 
the sea-weed floating over her white gown, and 
the pearls in her beautiful hair? How exquisite a 
thing she would be ! The very monsters of the 
deep would hold their breath as they passed, and 
leave her unmolested. And the eye of mortal 
man would never gaze upon her again. There 
was divinest ecstacy in the thought ! Ah ! how 
lovely she was ! What a face — -what a form ! 

He staggered back from the window and gave 
a loud laugh. At last it had been vanquished 
and broken — that iron hand. He had heard it 
snap that moment within his brain. And it was 
pouring upward, that river of song. The elfins 
had come back, and were quiring like the im- 
mortals. She would hear them down there, in 
her cold, nameless grave, with the ceaseless re- 
quiem of the waters above her, and smile and 
rejoice that death had come to her to give him 
speech. His brain was the very cathedral of 
heaven, and there was music in every part of it. 
The glad shout was ringing throughout nave and 
transept like the glorious greeting of Christmas 
morning. "Her face! Her form!" No, no; 
not that again. They were no part of the 
burning flood of song which was writhing and surg- 
ing in his brain. They were not the words which 
would tell the world — Ah ! what was it ? " Her 
face ! Her form ! — " 

He groped his way to and fro like a blind man 
seeking some object to guide him. " Her eyes ! 
Her hair ! " No, no. Oh, what was this ? Why 
was he falling — falling ? — What was that terror-
stricken cry ? that wild, white face of an old man 
above him ? Where had this water come from 
that was boiling and thundering in his ears? 
What was that tossed aloft by the wave beyond ?
