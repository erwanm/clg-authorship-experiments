She laid down her work, and her mother closed her book upon her
forefinger again, and they watched the graceful white vessel as she
glided slowly in from the Conca, which she had rounded while they had
been talking.

"It's very big, for a yacht," observed Mrs. Bowring. "They are coming
here."

"They have probably come round from Naples to spend a day," said Clare.
"We are sure to have them up here. What a nuisance!"

shyness in this respect was almost morbid; but she had unconsciously
caught a little of it herself, and, like her mother, she was often quite
uselessly on her guard against strangers, of the kind whom she might
