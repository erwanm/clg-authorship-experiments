"The students can now do anything they like in the mess rooms. They have
plenty of money, and if they want to gamble, they can. They were playing
last night when the first part of the starboard watch were on duty."

"You are right, Mr. Kendall," said Mr. Lowington "The students must be
looked after in their rooms. Has there ever been any gambling among the
officers in the after cabin?"

"I never saw any, or heard of any. I don't think there has been."

"I hope not; but we must grapple with this question in earnest," added
the principal, as he led the way out of the state room into the main
cabin.

The chaplain and the doctor were there, and Mr. Lowington wished to take
their advice upon the serious matter before him; and before he permitted
the second lieutenant to retire, he stated the case to them.

"Gambling!" groaned the chaplain.

"I detected them in the act myself," added Mr. Lowington. "You may
retire, Mr. Kendall."

"Why, this is awful!"

"Boys will do almost anything that men will," said Dr. Winstock, the
surgeon.

"Drinking and gambling!" ejaculated the chaplain. "What are we coming
to?"

"I fear there are other vices of which we know nothing yet," added the
doctor.

"Why, I'm afraid the Academy Ship will prove to be a failure, after
all," sighed Mr. Agneau.

"Not at all," argued Dr. Winstock. "We are in position here to treat
these evils properly. There are no fond mothers and indulgent fathers to
spoil the boys, when the discipline becomes sharp."
