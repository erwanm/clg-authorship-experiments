It seemed to Celia that Mr. Howarth showed even 
grander here than she had ever remarked before. Noth- 
ing dwarfed him. Strong, compassionate, tender to his 
wife as some mother of her darling, there were no weak 
or superficial lines. No virtue of home was dropped 
when society's keen eyes were off him. 

On their return journey they met with an artistic New 
York party, some of whom Celia remembered at her 
reception. One of their number, a Mrs. Linthorpe, espe- 
cially pleased Celia. She had made her way up to her 



 

present position, which was an unquestionably fine one, 
weighted by an intemperate and brutal husband, and, in 
early life, four children. Her two girls had died young, 
her two sons were settled in business, her husband had 
been dead for some years ; and now she found herself free 
to enjoy the fame and honor she had wrested from the 
world by the very hardest. 

She never quite knew what drew the young girl to her 
with such a subtile fascination, but she recognized the 
impassioned soul of art in its purest estate. 

"Such a friendship can do her no harm," said Mrs. 
Howarth, "and it may benefit her at home. One can 
trust Paul Thierry to the uttermost, but it is time she 
made friendships among her own sex." 

To this experience was added another that was destined 
to work much change and pain in Celia's hitherto simple 
existence, which had been kept from fever heats through 
girlhood's budding years. The only really young man in 
the party was an unspoiled favorite of society, the last 
tf a long line who might have vied with Helen Lennox
