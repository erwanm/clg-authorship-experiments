surely has happened. He had always supposed he would 
be his aunt's heir, all three of the women had been gen- 
erous to him, but this is such an uniooked for phase. No 
one has found any fault with him, neither has he been 
unduly extravagant. What can it mean? And that 
paltry thousand dollars ! 
However, the morning does not delay. It comes in 
crisp and sunny, to soften down presently to the glow and 
richness of Indian summer. There is breakfast, and the 
two go to the dark old library. Mrs. Sherrard seats her- 
self in front of the table. 
"Fairfax," she says suddenly, "have you ever thought 
of marrying ! " 
He is crimson to the roots of his hair, and his tongue 
cleaves to the roof of his mouth. Then he gathers up 
courage, and with an unnatural little laugh replies, — 
"I suppose I shall some time — most men do. Sher-

in possession of sufficient fortune to enable him to marry, 
he had planned to make one bold stroke, to marry and let 
her forgive afterward, as he felt sure she would. Now 
the issue must be precipitated. For an instant he is 
tempted to utter a square, uncompromising falsehood, 
then Celia's pure eyes look him through. 
"I have met a lady I like very much. I have not 
debated the subject of marriage very closely," and he 
tries to look indifferent. 
"Will you mention her name?" and the old lady's tone 
is ominously smooth. 
" Not at present. I should not discuss her with any 
person until it was-— was a settled thing," — stumbling a 
little. 
" Then I will mention it, having no delicate scruples.
