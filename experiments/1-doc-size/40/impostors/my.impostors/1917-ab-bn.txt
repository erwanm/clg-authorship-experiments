Now Ellen took down her coat and hat and went out 
and down the lane to Larry's. She felt quiet and sober 
about her mission : for at last she was to disobey the flag 
and walk into the house where Larry, if he were ill, needed 
her more than when he was well. Smilie came bounding 
and twisting to meet her, and she knew Larry must have 
been up that morning to let her out. She tapped at the 
door, a little sick within her, because she could not guess 
what she should find; and then, when he did not answer, 
she opened the door and walked in. But for some reason 
she shut Smilie out. She had a foolish feeling that Smilie

stale air and liquor. There was no fire and Larry lay on 



 

the sofa, breathing heavily. She threw the blanket rug 
over him, built up the fire and set the kettle on to boil. 
Then she found some bread and meat for Smilie, and put 
it out on the step, and sat down by Larry and looked at

she thought him still Larry, though strangely changed. 
And after the kettle had boiled and she had put it back 
and had sat perhaps an hour more by the fire, he woke and 
saw her brooding there. It seemed a long time before 
right knowledge came to him of what the vision really 
was, because he had never before risen from his abyss to 
find a human creature. But now, as he came more and 
more to himself, he saw that this was no part of a dream, 
as it had been before, but Ellen who had broken through 
the invisible walls. As he sat up and put his hands to 
his face to shut her out â€” and it looked as if he raised 
them most pathetically to eyes that must be weeping be-
