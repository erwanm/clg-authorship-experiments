“It’s only their defending themselves so much more than they need--it’s
only THAT that makes me wonder. It’s their having so remarkably much to

anything of that sort come in right.”

“I’m surely never horrid or low,” he returned, “about anyone but my
extravagant wife. I can do with all our friends--as I see them myself:
what I can’t do with is the figures you make of them. And when you take
