“ That looks rather solid,” said Dan. 

Then a gust of wind came up, and they all shiv-

warmth of the library was comforting, and there

The twins had been setting their table in the

“ Don’t you s’pose mother brought home some last

all been real good. Cap said so.” 

“ Yes,” returned Laurel, big-eyed. She
