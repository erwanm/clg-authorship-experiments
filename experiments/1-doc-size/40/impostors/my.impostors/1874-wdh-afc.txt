do her good. But she was growing frailer, the 
whole time. She died in March. I found some 
old friends of hers in Naples, and came home with 
them." 

The girl hesitated a little over the words, which 
she nevertheless uttered unbroken, while the tears 
fell quietly down her face. She seemed to have 
forgotten the angry words that had passed be 
tween her and Ferris, to remember him only as one 
who had known her mother, while she went on to 
relate some little facts in the history of her mother's 
last days ; and she rose into a higher, serener at 
mosphere, inaccessible to his resentment or his re 
gret, as she spoke of her loss. The simple tale of 
sickness and death inexpressibly belittled his pas 
sionate woes, and made them look theatrical to him. 
He hung his head as they turned at her motion 
and walked away from the picture of Don Tppolito, 
and down the stairs toward the street-door ; the 
people before the other Venetian picture had ap 
parently yielded to their craving for lunch, and had 
vanished. 

" I have very little to tell you of my own life," 
Ferris began awkwardly. " I came home soon after 
you started, and I went to Providence to find you, 
but you had not got back." 

Florida stopped him and looked perplexedly into 
his face, and then moved on. 

" Then I went into the army. I wrote once to 
you."
