intemperate, but I suspect he had been drinking something that day.”

“He doesn’t seem to like me,” Paul ventured to say.

“What makes you think so?”

Hereupon Paul related his reception when he went to the barn to harness
the horses.

Mrs. Granville listened thoughtfully.

“He should not have acted so,” she said; “I presume he didn’t like the
idea of being superseded.”

“Has he been with you a long time?”

“He and his mother have been in my service for a long time. I think
Mrs. Mercer is of a jealous disposition. She never wishes me to have
any one here, but she is very faithful and loyal.”

“I wonder if that is the case,” thought Paul. The housekeeper did not
seem to him like one who would be unselfishly devoted to the service of
any one.

Several days passed. Every day Mrs. Granville rode out, sometimes
in the forenoon, sometimes in the afternoon, and the effect was
perceptible in her improved health and spirits.

“It is fortunate for me that you came here,” she said one day. “Before
you came I rode out only once or twice a week. It seems to do me great
good to drive every day.”

“Why did you not go out every day, Mrs. Granville?” asked Paul.

“Frost did not seem to like the trouble of going out with me,” she
answered. “He often sent word that he was at work, and could not go
conveniently.”

Paul wondered whether he was engaged smoking in the barn. In his guess
he came near the truth.
