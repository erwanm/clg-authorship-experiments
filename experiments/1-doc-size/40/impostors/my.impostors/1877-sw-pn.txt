"The Bible says, 'whether ye eat or drink, or 
whatsoever ye do,'" Mr. Murray answered. "In an 
other place, ' what soever ye do, in word or deed.'" 
"Well, Mr. Murray, I don't understand it; take 
eating and drinking how can that be done to the 
glory of God?" 
" You can easily see how it can be done not to 
his glory. Any way that is not becoming his servant, is not to his glory. Therefore, in excess of 
things that do not agree with you and therefore 
unfit you for duty of costly dishes, which take 
the money that might feed starving people." 
" But I can't feed all the starving people ! " said 
Flora. 
"It is something to feed one. But I will give 
you another Bible mark, Miss Flora, l He that saith 
he abideth in him,' that is, in Christ, ' ought himself 
also so to walk even as he walked.' Now remember 
how Christ walked. He was here, ' as one that 
serveth' He 'ivent about doing good.' He ' pleased 
 
not himself.' He ''did always those things that please' 
God." 
" But one can't be like him" said Esther. 
" That depends entirely upon whether you choose 
to be like him." 
" Oh Uncle Eden ! He was" 
" Yes, I know, and I know what you are, and I, 
and all of us. It remains true, ' God is faithful, by 
whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son 
Jesus Christ our Lord;' 'chosen, that we should 
be holy and without blame before him in love.' " 
There was a pause of some length. Flora was 
silenced, but her eyes had filled and her face wore 
a pained and bitter expression. Meredith had 
glanced at her and thought it better not to speak. 
Maggie was in a depth of meditation. Fenton had 
gone scrambling down the rocks. Esther looked 
somewhat bored. 
" Have you got your book there, Meredith ? " Mr. 
Murray asked.
