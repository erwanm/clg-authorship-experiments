"'What did this man do in the daring of faith? 
He first got permission of his superiors; then he 
went aboard of a little boat, took nothing else 
with him but his Bible and his prayer-book, his 
few tools, a fishing net, and food for several days, 
and then dropped down the Weser, all alone, intending by that way to get to the Eastphalians. 
But his chief strength was prayer, in which he 
lived day and night. When he came to the place 
where the Aller flows into the Weser, he quitted 
the Weser and went up the Aller, that he might 
look at the spot where those 4,500 Saxons were cut 
to pieces by Charlemagne, and on the ground pray 
for the murdered men. For at that time it was 
believed that even the dead could be helped by 
prayer, as is still the erroneous teaching of the 
Catholics. Leaving that place, he wished to visit 
the "stone-houses," that he might pray there too, 
where the captive Franks had been slaughtered by 
the Saxons; and so he went on up the Aller and 
from the Aller into the Oerze, all the while living 
upon the fish which he caught.' " 



 

" Had he no bread ? " said Maggie. 

"How should he? going through wild woods 
and countries alone in his boat ? He would come 
to no baker's shops, Maggie."
