The mother seemed to divine a compliment in this indefinite speech. She
said: "Well, I don't see myself why they didn't take it."

"There was probably no one to feel how much better they were," said
Ludlow.

"Well, that's what I think," said the mother, "and it's what I tell
her." She stood looking from Ludlow to her daughter and back, and now
she ventured, seeing him so intent on the sketch he still held, "You an
artist?"

"A student of art," said Ludlow, with the effect of uncovering himself
in a presence.

The mother did not know what to make of it apparently; she said
blankly, "Oh!" and then added impressively, to her daughter: "Why don't
you show them to him, Cornelia?"

"I should think it a great favor," said Ludlow, intending to be
profoundly respectful. But he must have overdone it. The girl
majestically gave her drawings to her mother, and marched out of the
aisle.

Ludlow ignored her behavior, as if it had nothing to do with the
question, and began to look at the drawings, one after another, with
various inarticulate notes of comment imitated from a great French
master, and with various foreign phrases, such as "Bon! Bon! Pas
mauvais! Joli! Chic!" He seemed to waken from them to a consciousness
of the mother, and returned to English. "They are very interesting. Has
she had instruction?"

"Only in the High School, here. And she didn't seem to care any for
that. She seems to want to work more by herself."

"That's wrong," said Ludlow, "though she's probably right about the
High School."

The mother made bold to ask, "Where are you taking lessons?"

"I?" said Ludlow, dreamily. "Oh! everywhere."
