LADDIE (running to meet them). Papa! Maidie’s got wings on her feet.
Why don’t I have some? Papa! Papa! Come into your new house. It grew
up out of the woods--like--like acorns.

DR. THORNE (addressing MRS. FAYTH, looking towards the cottage). It
is a shelter for the child, at all events. Quite in accordance with my
present social position in this place--a mere cottage--but it makes him
a home, poor little fellow!

MRS. FAYTH. It’s just what Helen would like. She hates palaces.

DR. THORNE (starts as if stabbed; makes no reply).

LADDIE (suddenly). Oh, Papa, Mrs. Fayth’s got wings on her feet, too.
Her dress covers them up. I like her better than I did that lady you
were so cross to.

MRS. FAYTH (laughing). I am so well!--oh, so well! I am a-shamed to be
so happy! I walk on air. I float on clouds. I move on waves. All nature
seems to be under my feet, and her glory in my heart.... Poor Doctor!
(Breaks off and looks at him with quick sympathy.) And yet I tru-ly
think you im-prove in spirits. You don’t look armed to the teeth, all
the time--now.

DR. THORNE (smiles cheerfully). A man must respect law, whatever state
he is in. I would conform to the customs of this place, so far as I can.
I would do this for the boy’s sake, at least. I don’t wish to be a
disgrace to him in this system of things.

MRS. FAYTH. Does Doctor Harvey treat you by scien-ti-fic ev-olu-tion?
That’s a man’s way. It’s a pretty slow one.

LADDIE (insistently). Papa, she has got wings on her feet.

MRS. FAYTH (blushing). Go away and play, children.

(The children run to the cottage. The little girl bounds before, with a
light, flying motion. They play in the cottage at “keeping house,”
running in and out.)
