go down like lead. It hurt me so that I cried 
out! 

My manuscript ! It was back again ! 

O Christ! How the sight of it hurt me! 
There was a letter with it, and my hand shook as 
I opened it: 

" We are returning you the manuscript of 
The Captive by messenger herewith, regretting 
exceedingly that we can not make you a pub- 
hshing ofifer upon it." 

Is not this awful? Oh, it is terrible! It is 
beyond belief! A whole month gone, and only a 
note like that to show for it! Four weeks of 
yearning and hoping — of watching the mail in 
agony — of struggling and toiling to forget ! And 
then a note like this! 

Oh, it drives me wild! I sat to-night in a 
chair motionless, forgetting that I was hungry, 
forgetting everything. I looked to the future; I 
had a feeling that I do not think I ever had in my 
life before — a horrible, black, yawning despair — 
a thing so fearful that it took my breath away. 
Suppose you were standing on a bridge over an 

abyss, and that suddenly it gave way, and in one 
dreadful instant you realized that you were going 
down — down like a flash — and that nothing 
could save you! 

So it is to be this, so this is to be my life! I 
am to send this book to publisher after publisher, 
and have it come back like this! And meanwhile 
to spend my time alternating between this room 
— and the wholesale-paper business!
