to teach me music. And then all the concerts 
that I long for! How long has it been since I 
have heard a note of music? 

I think that is all I want. I want no toys in 
my life. I want my freedom, and my soul, and 
the forest once again. — 

I read some of the psalms to-night — far, far 
into the morning. My heart is a psalm. 

— I have gotten something to do! I am a 
waiter in a restaurant on Sixth Avenue! I got 

the place this morning. Ugh! — it is nasty be- 
yond words. But I do not care, it will keep me 

alive. 

July nth. 

What a thing is hope! I have been for two 
days chained in the most horrible kind of a place. 
Picture it — to stand all day and see low people 
stuffing themselves with food — the dirt and the 
grease and the stench and the endless hideous 
drudgery ! And I five days out of the springing 
forest and the ecstasy of inspiration! — Truly, it 
is a thing to put one's glory to a test! But I 
hardly feel it — I walk on air — deep back in my 
soul there is an organ song, I hear it all day, all 
day! 

How soon will they write? I fly up-stairs 
each night, looking for a letter. Hurry up! 
Hurry up!
