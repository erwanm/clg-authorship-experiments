was the first time since their meeting at Geneva that 
Roderick had mentioned his cousin 's name, but the ice 
being broken he indulged for some time afterwards in 
frequent allusions to his betrothed, which always had an 
accent of scrupulous, of almost studied, consideration. 
An uninitiated observer, hearing him, would have ima

be very much struck with the merits of Roderick 's mis 
tress, the irregularity here was hardly Roderick s, was a 
view of the case to which our virtuous hero did scanty 
justice. There were women, he said to himself, whom
