whom the former distinction was not conceded were free 
to reflect that she was " not at all liked." 

It would have been difficult to guess, however, how they 
reconciled this conviction with a variety of contradictory 
evidence, and in especial with the spectacle of Roderick 's 
inveterate devotion. All Rome might behold that he at 
least "liked" Christina Light. Wherever she appeared 
he was either awaiting her or immediately followed her. 
He was perpetually at her side, trying apparently to pre 
serve some broken thread of talk, the fate of which was, 
to judge by her face, profoundly immaterial to the 
young lady. People in general smiled at the radiant 
good faith of the handsome young sculptor, and asked 
each other whether he really supposed that beauties of 
that quality were meant to give themselves to juvenile 
artists. But although Christina 's deportment, as I have 
said, was one of superb inexpressiveness, Rowland had 
derived from Roderick no suspicion that he suffered from 
snubbing, and he was therefore surprised at an incident 
that occurred one evening at a large musical party. 
Roderick, as usual, was in the field, and on the ladies 
taking the chairs which had been arranged for them he 



 

immediately placed himself beside Christina. As most 
of the gentlemen were standing, his position made him 
as conspicuous as Hamlet at Ophelia 's feet. Rowland 
was leaning somewhat apart, against the chimney-piece. 
There was a long solemn pause before the music began, 
and in the midst of it Christina rose, left her place, came 
the whole length of the immense room, with every 
one looking at her, and stopped before him. She was 
neither pale nor flushed ; she had a soft smile. 

" Will you do me a favour ?" she asked.
