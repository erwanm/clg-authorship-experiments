Sultan Suleiman. This stands close by the Jaffa Gate, and is the most
picturesque object in all the circuit of the walls, and, although the
citadel is of modern origin, its most characteristic portion lays claim
to great antiquity. The massive structure which impresses all strangers
who enter by the Jaffa Gate is called the Tower of Hippicus, and also
the Tower of David. It is identified as the tower which Herod built and
Josephus describes, and there is as little doubt that its foundations
are the same that David laid and Solomon strengthened. There are no such
stones in any other part of the walls as these enormous bevelled blocks;
they surpass those in the Harem wall, at what is called the Jews’
Wailing Place. The tower stands upon the northwest corner of the old
wall of Zion, and being the point most open to attack it was most
strongly built.

It seems also to have been connected with the palace on Zion which David
built, for it is the tradition that it was from this tower that the king
first saw Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, when “it came to pass in an
eventide that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of
the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself;
and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.” On the other side
of the city gate we now look down upon the Pool of Bathsheba, in which
there is no water, and we are informed that it was by that pool that the
lovely woman, who was destined to be the mother of Solomon, sat when
the king took his evening walk. Others say that she sat by the Pool of
Gibon. It does not matter. The subject was a very fruitful one for the
artists of the Renaissance, who delighted in a glowing reproduction
of the biblical stories, and found in such incidents as this and the
confusion of Susanna themes in which the morality of the age could
express itself without any conflict with the religion of the age. It is
a comment not so much upon the character of David as upon the morality
of the time in which he lived, that although he repented, and no doubt
sincerely, of his sin when reproved for it, his repentance did not take
the direction of self-denial; he did not send away Bathsheba.

This square old tower is interiorly so much in ruins that it is not easy
to climb to its parapet, and yet it still has a guardhouse attached to
it, and is kept like a fortification; a few rusty old cannon, under the
charge of the soldiers, would injure only those who attempted to fire
them; the entire premises have a tumble-down, Turkish aspect. The view
from the top is the best in the city of the city itself; we saw also
