Dolly was a little uneasy at the travelling problem before her; however, no uneasiness could 
stand long against the charm of that morning's 
drive. The blessed familiar sun shone on a world 
so very different from all the world she had ever 



 

known before. On every hand were flower gardens ; on both sides of the way ; and in the midst 
of the flower gardens stood pleasant looking country houses; while the road was bordered with narrow canals, over which drawbridges of extrava- 
gant size led to the houses. It was a rich and 
quaint and pretty landscape under the September 
sun; and Dolly felt all concern and annoyance 
melting away from her. She saw that her mother 
too was amused and delighted. Surely things 
would come out right by and by.

the fronts of houses," said the lady.

they would only hold up straight," said Rupert. 
" What ails the town ? " 

"Bad soil, most likely," returned Lawrence.
