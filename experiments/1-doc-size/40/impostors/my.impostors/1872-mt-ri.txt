directly, higher and still higher up the mountain-side — threw 
out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and sent them 
trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts 
and ribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty 
mountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled net- 
work of red lava sti'eams. Away across the water the crags 
and domes were lit with a ruddy glare, and the firmament above 
was a reflected hell ! 

Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing 
mirror of the lake ! Both pictures were sublime, both were 
beautiful ; but that in the lake had a bewildering richness about it 
that enchanted the eye and held it with the stronger fascination. 

We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours. 

We never thought of supper, and never felt fatigue. But at 
eleven o'clock the conflagration had traveled beyond our range 
of vision, and then darkness stole down upon the landscape 
again. 

Hunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat. 
The provisions were all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go

back to the old camp, but while out a long way from shore, so 
great a storm came up that we dared not try to land. So I 
baled out the»seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled heavily 
through the billows till we had reached a point three or four 
miles beyond the camp. The storm was increasing, and it be- 
came evident that it was better to take the hazard of beaching 
the boat than go down in a hundred fathoms of water ; so we 
ran in, with tall white-caps following, and I sat down in the 
6tern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore. The instant 
the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that washed crew 
and cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble. We shivered
