says he will tell us her story by-and-by if we care to hear it. He

Captain John went off to bring the first plate of fish to the dear

It was a merry supper, and the moon was up before it ended; for
everything “tasted so good” the hearty young appetites sharpened by
sea air were hard to satisfy. When the last cunner had vanished and
nothing but olives and oyster crackers remained, the party settled

women was an English governess, and when the lady she was with went
on her way after the wreck, this pretty girl (who by the way was a
good deal hurt trying to save the child she had in charge) was left
