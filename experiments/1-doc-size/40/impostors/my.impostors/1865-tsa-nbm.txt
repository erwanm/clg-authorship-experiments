in the same blind, besotted way stifling the soul's 
higher instincts, dwarfing its powers, suppressing its 
yearnings after the things for which it hungers and 
thirsts with an immortal desire and for what ? Just 
for gold for gold, and the unsatisfying good that gold 
can buy this, and no more no more. If Adam is 
going to walk in the broad way to misery to misery 
in this world, I mean, for there is no happiness by the 
way nor at the end I pity him from my heart." 



" But most of all, I pity Lydia," said Lena. " If 
Adam will make his bed of husks, and put thorns in his 
own pillow, let him enjoy them if he can ; but for Ly 
dia ! Ah, my heart grows faint for her. She is of a 
purer substance, and of a tenderer organization. She 
will have no sordid loves to sustain her no end of world 
ly gain or worldly pride, like him ; and so must endure 
or die. This marriage is a serious thing, Edward. 
Thank God, that you are not like Adam Guy ! Could 
we be happier in a palace than in this modest home of 
ours ? Would hundreds of thousands of dollars make 
our hearts beat in closer unison, aud fill them with a 
purer happiness ? " 

" Not unless our lives were in accord with all things 


good, and true, and beautiful. Not unless in our souls 
were the spiritual riches to which this outward wealth 
corresponded. Anything less than this, and the ex 
change would be to our loss, instead of gain." 

" So I feel, and say, thank God, that you are wiser 
than most men ! " And Lena threw tender glances upon 
her husband. 

' It is one thing to see clearly the right way in which 
to walk, and another thing to go forward in that way,"
