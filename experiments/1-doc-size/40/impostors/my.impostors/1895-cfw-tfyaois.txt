at."

"Ah! I dare say it makes you ill. We had a very nasty day when we
crossed from Folkestone."

"No; it ain't that exactly. I sit here because I like ter see the things
grow," hazarded the American, timidly, as if she felt that some
explanation was expected.

"The things?"

"Yes, in there." (She pointed to the paling fence.) "There's peas, and
asparagus, and beans, and some sorts I don't know; you wouldn't believe
how they do push up, day after day."

"Ah, indeed! I dare say they do," the Englishwoman answered, a little
bewildered, looking at the lines of green behind the palings.

"Her name is Ash, Azubah Ash--fancy!" she said to her husband, later. "I
saw it written on a Swiss basket in which she keeps her crewel-work. She
is extremely odd. She has no maid, yet she wears those very good
diamonds; and she always appears in that Paris gown of rich black
silk--the very richest quality, I assure you, Augustas: she wears it and
the diamonds at breakfast. She has spoken of a son, but apparently he
never turns up. And she spends all her time on a bench behind the house
watching the beans grow."

"I should think she would bore herself to extinction," said the
easy-going vicar.

"I dare say she is having rather a hard time of it, she is so
born√©e. I would offer her a book, but I don't think she ever reads.
And when I told her that I should be very pleased to show her some of
the pretty walks about here, she said that she never walked. She must be
sadly lonely, poor thing!"

But Mrs. Ash was not lonely; or, if she was, she did not know the name
of her malady. The comings and goings of her son were without doubt very
uncertain; but the mother had been born among people who believe that
the "men-folks" of a family have an existence apart from that of mothers
