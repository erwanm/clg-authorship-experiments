Just then Tim Rafferty himself turned the corner. There was a lull in
his business, and he was wandering along the street eating an apple.

“There he is,” said Phil, suddenly espying his enemy.

Dick looked up, and saw with satisfaction that Phil was right. Tim had
not yet espied either, nor did he till Dick addressed him.

“Are you round collectin’ fiddles this mornin’?” he asked.

Tim looked up, and, seeing that his victim had found an able champion,
felt anxious to withdraw. He was about to turn back, but Dick advanced
with a determined air.

“Jest stop a minute, Tim Rafferty,” said he. “I’m a-goin’ to intervoo
you for the Herald. That’s what they do with all the big rascals
nowadays.”

“I’m in a hurry,” said Tim.

“That’s what the pickpocket said when the cop was gently persuadin’ him
to go to the Tombs, but the cop didn’t see it. I want the pleasure of
your society a minute or two. I hear you’re in the music business.”

“No, I’m not,” said Tim, shortly.

“What made you borrer this boy’s fiddle, then?”

“I don’t know anything about it,” said Tim, in a fright.

“Some folks forgets easy,” returned Dick. “I know a man what went into
Tiffany’s and took up a watch to look at, and carried it off, forgettin’
to pay for it. That’s what he told the judge the next day, and the judge
sent him to the island for a few months to improve his memory. The air
over to the island is very good to improve the memory.”

“You ought to know,” said Tim, sullenly; “you’ve been there times
enough.”
