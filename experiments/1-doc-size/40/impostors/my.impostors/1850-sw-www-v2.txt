" I didn't meet them," said Ellen ; — " I came away only a 
little while after Nancy." 

" They went 'cross lots I guess, — that's how it was ; and 
that's the way Nancy got the start of you." 






" What, sliall I do ?" said Ellen. She could not bear to 
wait till they returned ; if she rode back she might miss them 
again, besides the delay ; and then a man on foot would 
make a long journey of it. Jenny told her of a house or two 
where she might try for a messenger ; but they were strangers to her ; she could not make up her mind to ask such a 
favor of them. Her friends were too far ovit of the way. 

"I'll go myself!" she said suddenly. "'Jell 'em, dear 
Jenny, will you, that I have gone for Dr. Gibson and 
that I'll bring him back as quick as ever I can. I know the 
road to Thirl wall." 

" But Ellen ! you mustn't,'' said Jenny ; — " I am- afraid to 
have you go all that way alone. Wait till the men come 
back, — they won't be long." 

" No I can't, Jenny," said Ellen, — " I can't wait ; I must 
go. You needn't be afraid. Tell 'em I'll be as quick as I 
can." 

" But see, Ellen !" cried Jenny as she was moving off, — - 
" I don't like to have you !" 
" I must Jenny. Never mind." 

" But see, Ellen !" cried Jenny again, — " if you will go — 
if you don't find Dr. Gibson just get Dr. Marshchalk, — he's 
every bit as good and some folks think he's better ; — he'll do 
just as well. Good-bye !"
