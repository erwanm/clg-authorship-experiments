gave the poor pagans a great deal of trouble. They 
first threw him to the wild beasts in the amphi- 
theatre, but the moment those animals set eyes on 
him they saw it would be of no use ; they just lay 
down and died. Very well, then ; the pagans de- 
termined to see what effect the axe would have upon 
San Miniato : but as soon as they struck off his head 
he picked it up, set it back on his shoulders again, 
waded across the Arno, walked up the hill, and when 
he came to a convenient little oratory up there he 
knelt down and expired. Isn't that a pretty good 
story ? It 's like fairies, isn't it ? "

"What nonsense!" said Imogene. "You made 
it up." 

"Oh, did I? Perhaps I built the church that 
stands there to commemorate the fact. It 's all in

of them are too proud tb put such stories in, but I 'm 
going to put every one I can find into the history 
I'm writing for Effie. San Miniato was beheaded
