that of the others who wore it; at least no one 
else carried a crush hat. 

At forty-one a man is still very much of a boy, 
and Colville was obscurely willing that Mrs. Bowen, 
whose life since they last met at an evening party 
had been passed chiefly at New York and Washing- 
ton, should see that he was a man of the world in 
spite of Des Vaches. Before she had decided which 
of the company she should first present him to, her 
daughter came up to his elbow with a cup of tea, 
and some bread and butter on a tray, and gave him 
good-evening with charming correctness of manner. 
" Eeally," he said, turning about to take the cup, 
" I thought it was you, Mrs. Bowen, who had got 



 

round to my side with a sash on. How do you and 
Miss Effie justify yourselves in looking so bewitch- 
ingly alike 'll " 

"You notice it, then?" Mrs. Bowen seemed 
delighted. 

" I did every moment you were together to-day. 
You don't mind my having been so personal in my 
observations ? " 

" Oh, not at all," said Mrs. Bowen, and Colville 
laughed. 

, "It must be true," he said, "what a French lady 
said to me at the tdble-d'hote dinner to-niglit : 'the 
Amerhicans always strhike the note of perhsona- 
lity.' " He neatly imitated the French lady's gut- 
tural accent.
