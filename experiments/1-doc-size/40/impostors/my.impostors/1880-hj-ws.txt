of another kind. The poor girl had an admirable 
sense of honor, and from the moment she had 
brought herself to the point of violating her father's 
wish, it seemed to her that she had no right to enjoy 
his protection. It was on her conscience that she 
ought to live under his roof only so long as she 
conformed to his wisdom. There was a great deal

to her. He knew perfectly what he was about, and 
this was part of a plan. She looked at him as much 
as she dared (for she was afraid of seeming to offer
