spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.”
She appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which
I went on: “I must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was

an acceptance of my companion’s own measure of my predecessor’s
abasement. There was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more
