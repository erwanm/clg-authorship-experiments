that can come. Those who discover that 
affection reposed has been given to an illu- 
sory representation, to a trickster that has 
cheated the heart, sound a deeper depth of 
grief, one where not only despair is, but 
stupor too. They may mourn, indeed, 
but they mourn for themselves, and they 
mourn alone. 

On the night to which Mrs. Smithwick 
had referred, that crack of doom which is 
to herald an eternal silence could not have 
more appalled the girl than the spectacle 
which her father's room disclosed. It had 
seemed to her then that she was insane, that 
the world was ; that, she was promenading 
consciously through a nightmare from which, 
despite the effort, she could not awake. So 
great was the tension that it may be in the 
strain her mind would have given way, had 
not oblivion thrown its pall and drawn her 
gently in its morphic arms. 

That night a fever came that was oblit- 
erating as the morrow of steps on the sand. 
For a month she was delirious. When she 




issued from it, though the unforgettable re- 
mained, she was still in ignorance of much 
that had occurred, and it was not until she 
was able to leave her room that it was con- 
sidered wise for her to learn a few fragments 
and particles of the truth. For the truth in 
its entirety was yet veiled and obscure.
