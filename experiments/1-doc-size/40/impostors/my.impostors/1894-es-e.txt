moment." 

But he slept with that wariness which 
dogs and lovers share, and he awoke, if 
not refreshed, at least alert. 

" I have seen that man before," he de- 
cided as he dressed. " But where ? " 

Then, mentally, he bolted at the eccen- 
tricity of his own thought. " I am daft," 
he told himself. But the thought remained, 
declining to be dismissed. 




Breakfast over he prowled about until an 
opportunity, which meanwhile he had deter- 
mined to seek, occurred. Myrrha went into 
the sitting-room ; he followed and locked 
the door. 

" Nobody can come in except through the 
window, and out of it any one who comes 
will go. Myrrha, I want ten minutes with 
you." 

Obedient, the girl sat down, her fingers 
intertwisted in her lap. But her face was 
very fair, the shadows had gone. The per- 
turbation of the night before had vanished. 
Dreams, tiara'd with coronets perhaps, may 
have reconciled her to fate. 

" Bien, monsieur, et puis ? " 

" Some time ago you asked me to be 
a brother, didn't you ? "
