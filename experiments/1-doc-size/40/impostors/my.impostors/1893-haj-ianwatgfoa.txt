a belt around my waist. It was gone, and so was my horse. Of course you
guess how it happened. My companion had robbed me during the night, and
left me in the woods utterly destitute."

"What was the name of your companion?" asked Obed quickly.

"He called himself Fletcher."

"I thought so!" exclaimed Obed, slapping his leg with emphasis. "We know
the gentleman a little ourselves."




CHAPTER IX.

A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE.

"You have not met Dick Fletcher?" said Ralph Granger in surprise.

"Yes, we only parted from him this morning."

"Did he rob you?"

"No, but he tried to."

Here Obed gave an account of Fletcher's searching his pockets during the
night.

"He thought I was sound asleep," he continued, "and so I was, but it
doesn't take much to wake me. When I gripped his throat, he concluded
he'd tackled the wrong man."

"Did you part company with him then?"

"No; he pretended he had been in search of matches, and I pretended to
believe it, but kept a good look-out. Last evening we stopped at the
Travellers' Rest, and Harry, here, overheard him and the landlord out in
the woods concocting a scheme to rob us, so I just told the gentleman
his room was better than his company, and he cleared out."
