quarreled and called names. Then we were sent 
here last winter. We were dreadfully homesick 
and strange. We wanted papa so very much. 
And the lessons were hard. But Miss Craven 
came and helped us and we were not lonely, but 
we wanted papa. Did you want your papa?" 
"Yes, at times. Then he came back and was 
with me only a little while when he died." 
"When you first came here you wore black 
gowns. I do not like them." 
Miss Craven paused and turned at the step. 
"Have you been making friends with my Helen?" 
and she smiled. 
"Is she yours? Will you let me have a piece 
of her sometimes?" 
"Which piece would you like?" 
Wilma thought a moment. "The piece that 
talks. That's the tongue. And it has to be fast 
hold of something, doesn't it? And her hands 
are so soft. Then her feet are so nice to take a 
walk. Oh dear, I am afraid I shall want all of 
her. But then, I can take her a little now and 
then." 
"Elma is very tired. Will you come up stairs 
with us and be brushed up a little, for it will soon 
be dinner time?" 
Wilma followed without demur. The maid had 
unpacked the trunk. There were the two little 
l 
white beds, the low chairs, the dressing table. 
Nurse came in to attend to them, but Miss Craven 
begged to do it this time. She curled their pretty 
hair ; they were not really beautiful children, but 
in their fresh white frocks they looked very nice. 
She kissed them fondly, and they all went down 
together. 
"I'm so glad to come back to you," Elma said 
just under her breath. "You and papa are the 
only ones I love." 
"And Wilma?"
