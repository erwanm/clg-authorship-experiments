Shutting the doors carefully, with an air of great precaution and
importance, she said: "Nellie, I've been wanting to talk to you;
something will have to be done about Eva: it will never do to let
matters go on as they are going."

Mrs. Van Arsdel's heart began to sink within her; she supposed that
she was to be required in some way to meddle or interfere with her
daughter. Now, if anything was to be done of an unpleasant nature,
Mrs. Van Arsdel had always far rather that Maria would do it herself.
But the most perplexing of her applications were when she began
stirring up her ease-loving, indulgent self to fulfill any such
purposes on her children. So she said, in a faltering voice, "What
is the matter now, Maria?"

"Well, what should you think?" said Mrs. Wouvermans, emphasizing the
words. "You know that good-for-nothing daughter of Mary's that lived
with me, years ago?"

"That handsome girl? To be sure."

"Handsome! the baggage! I've no patience when I think of her, with
her airs and graces; dressing so that she really was mistaken for one
of the family! And such impertinence! I made her walk Spanish very
quick----"

"Well?"

"Well, who do you suppose this sick girl is that Angelique and Alice
have been helping take care of in the new hospital, or whatever you
call it, that those Popish women have started up there?"

Now Mrs. Van Arsdel knew very well what Aunt Maria was coming to, but
she only said, faintly,

"Well?"

"Its just that girl and no other, and a more impudent tramp and huzzy
doesn't live."

"It really is very shocking," said Mrs. Van Arsdel.
