your father's partner was an honest man ? " 

"Why, I suppose so;" and Jessie could not forbear 
smiling at the energetic little body. 

"There are many rogues in this world, Miss Jessie 
wolves in sheep's clothing. To think that Rachel and I 
should put most of our little fortin' in that speculation years 
ago, and be misled by our own cousin, too ! Why, I'd a 





trusted him with every dollar that I had in the world, only 
I'm glad we didn't. But we've had to pinch since. To be 
sure, we have our house, as Miss Perkins says; but if you 
eat and drink that, it's soon gone ! " 

The fortune was a standing grievance to Miss Hetty, a 
sort of gauge with which she always compared everything 
that happened, and drew some parallel. Nearly ten years 
before they had been induced to invest it in some lands 
said to be rich in copper ore ; but the mining company 
failed, and the plausible cousin wen *, to South America: 
so they still held title-deeds to acres and acres of unsalable 
imid. 

" We have no reason to believe that Mr. Stanhope would 
take the advantage of papa," Jessie replied, quite firmly. 

"But you never know what people will do until they are 
tried. Didn't we have the utmost faith in cousin Bright? " 

Hetty looked up in triumph, as if that was an unanswer- 
able argument. 

" But Miss Jessie is right. It's not fair to surmise when 
one has no proof. He lost as much as your papa did he 
not?"
