the shore, this platform was let down upon the 
ground, forming a slope on which carriages were 
driven into and out of the bateau. 



 



At each end of the platform there was a long 
lever, extending in-board ; and when the boat was 
ready to start, the ends of the levers were dropped 
down, and secured in large iron rings. The drop 
was thus elevated above the water, and on a level 
with it, making a platform on which the steersman 
stood, and worked a long, crooked oar, by which the 
course of the boat was controlled. The mast was 
fixed in the middle of one side of the boat, where 
it would not interfere with the standing room of 
vehicles. The sail was trimmed forward or aft of 
the mast, according to the direction the boat was 
to go. 

Attached to the same side of the boat with the 
mast, one forward and one aft the sail, were two 
large elliptical pieces of plank, swinging on pivots 
at one end, which answered the purpose of a keel, 
when the boat was going on the wind, such as may 
be seen on the Dutch vessels on the Rhine and the 
Scheldt.

He was not in a very amiable frame of mind ; he
