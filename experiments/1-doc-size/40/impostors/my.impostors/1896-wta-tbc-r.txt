Butterfly?"

"Capital!" exclaimed George.

The matter was all arranged; and the party soon reached the boat-house,
and spent a pleasant evening in the hospitable mansion of Captain
Sedley.




CHAPTER XXI

THE CONCLUSION


The first two weeks of the organization of the boat club passed away,
and the members were assembled in Zephyr Hall to elect a coxswain.
According to the constitution, Frank's term of office had expired.

"Whom do you intend to vote for, Fred?" asked Charles Hardy, who
appeared to be very anxious about the election.

"I don't know; I haven't decided yet," replied Fred Harper. "You know
what Captain Sedley said the other day about it."

"Yes; but if I have got to vote, I want to get my mind made up. I don't
see what harm there can be in talking about it a little."

"He said he did not want any electioneering about the
officers--'log-rolling,' my father calls it."

"Of course not," replied Charles demurely.

"The best fellow ought to get the office," said Fred slyly.

"Of course, but who is the best fellow? That's the question. We ought
to talk it over among ourselves a little," added Charles.

"What good would that do?"
