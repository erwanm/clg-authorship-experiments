She had turned entirely toward him on the seat beside him; her
child-like hands clasped on the robe over her knees, her child-like
face, pale, sweet, wistful, turned to his.
"Would you abandon me?" she asked.
"The situation is impossible----"
"Yes, but tell me."
"I don't care to think of such a----"
"Please answer me. Is your partisanship so bitter that you would wash
your hands of me--let me go to my death?--go to your own, too, rather
than help me?"
"Miss Girard, you are losing your composure----"
"No; I am perfectly composed. But I should like to know what you would
do under such circumstances with a girl nineteen years old who stood in
danger of death."
"I can't tell you," he said, perplexed and impatient. "I can't tell now
what I might do."
"Would you denounce me?"
"No, of course not."
"Would you feel--sorry?"
"Sorry!" He looked at her; "I should think I would!"
"Sorry enough for me to help me get away?"
"Yes."
"Even if I carried military information to Germany?"
He looked into her eyes searchingly for a moment. "Yes," he said; "I'd
do what I could for you to get you out of England."
"Even if I had lied to you?"
"You couldn't lie to anybody."
"But if I could? If I have lied and you found it out, would you still
try to help me to get away?"
"You are asking something that----"
"Yes, you can answer it. You can think a while first and then answer. I
want you to answer. I want to know what you'd do with me."
"You make it a personal matter?"
"Yes. I don't want to know what you'd do in theory; I wish you to tell
me what you, personally, would do with me, Karen Girard, if you believed
me to be a spy, and if you came to the conclusion that I had lied to
you."
"Why do you ask all this? You are over-wrought, unstrung----"
"I am absolutely mistress of myself. And I wish to know what you would
do with me? Would you let me die?"
