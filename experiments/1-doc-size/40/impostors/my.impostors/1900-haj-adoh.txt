“Bring him in,” he said quickly.

“Probably,” he thought, “Gerald has repented his refusal and is ready
to enter into negotiations for the sale of his small patrimony in
Colorado.”

Gerald entered the room with an easy grace, and bowed to Mr. Wentworth.
The merchant could see that he was no longer the unsophisticated boy
whom he had met in the Colorado mountains. Still he did not give Gerald
credit for the full change which had passed over him.

“Be seated,” he said. “I suppose you have come about the land your
father left you in Colorado.”

“No, Mr. Wentworth, I have sold this land, or at least four-fifths of
it.”

Wentworth looked disappointed.

“You should have accepted my offer,” he said harshly.

“I should have made a very great mistake if I had,” replied Gerald
calmly.

“How much did you sell it for?”

“I sold four-fifths of it for six thousand dollars.”

Mr. Wentworth was amazed, but he gathered strength to say, “Probably
you will never get your money.”

“It was paid me in cash, and I have it invested in good dividend-paying
bank stock in St. Louis.”

“Then,” said Wentworth after a pause, “I don’t understand what has
brought you here.”

“I have some very important business with you, Mr. Wentworth. I have
come to ask you to redeem the solemn promise made to my father to pay
him twenty thousand dollars.”
