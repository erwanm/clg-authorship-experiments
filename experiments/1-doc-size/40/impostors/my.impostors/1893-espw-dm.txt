revolving study-chair (Jamie had gone to 
bed), put his feet on the table, wheeled 
around slowly, and heavily said : 

" It 's all up, Marey. I'm expelled from 
Harle College." 

" What for ? " asked Don sharply, wheel 
ing too. 

" Oh, for the graveyard business." 

" Nothing else ? " 

" They didn't mention anything else. 
That was the point. Buried alive ; brutal 
ity, and that sort of thing." 

"Did you deny it?"

expelled. That 's all."

by the suffering of the last few weeks, 
showed sensitive agitation while Trouncey 
spoke. 

" Not a word. Didn't seem to spot you.
