Mrs. Sprowl, he obeyed a third subp≈ìna, and presented himself with an
air of cheerful confidence that instantly enraged her.

The old lady lay abed with nothing more compromising than a toothache;
Quarren was conducted to the inner shrine; she glared at him hideously
from her pillows; and for one moment he felt seriously inclined to run.

"I know damn well you've been nowhere," she burst out. "Molly Wycherly's
dance went to pieces because she was fool enough to trust things to you.
Do you know who led? That great oaf, Barent Van Dyne! He led like a
trick elephant, too!"

Quarren looked politely distressed.

"And there are a dozen hostesses perfectly furious with you," continued
the old lady, pounding the pillows with a fat arm--"parties of all sorts
spoiled, idiocies committed, dinners either commonplace or blank
failures--what the devil possesses you to behave this way?"

"I'm tired," he said, politely.

"What!"

He smiled:

"Oh, the place suits, Mrs. Sprowl; I haven't any complaint; and the work
and wages are easy; and it's comfortable below-stairs. But--I'm just
tired."

"What are you talking about?"

"I'm talking about my employers, and I'm talking like the social
upper-servant that I am--or was. I'm merely giving a respectable
warning; that is the airy purport of my discourse, Mrs. Sprowl."

"Do you know what you're saying?"
