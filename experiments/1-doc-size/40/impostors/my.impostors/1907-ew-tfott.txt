strange instruments."

"Providence and Blanche Carbury?" She stared at him. "Ah, you are
profoundly corrupt!"

"I have the coarse masculine habit of looking facts in the face.
Woman-like, you prefer to make use of them privately, and cut them when
you meet in public."

"Blanche is not the kind of fact I should care to make use of under any
circumstances whatever!"

"No one asks you to. Simply regard her as a force of nature--let her
alone, and don't put up too many lightning-rods."

She raised her eyes to his face. "Do you really mean that you want Bessy
to get a divorce?"

"Your style is elliptical, dear Maria; but divorce does not frighten me
very much. It has grown almost as painless as modern dentistry."

"It's our odious insensibility that makes it so!"

Mr. Langhope received this with the mildness of suspended judgment. "How
else, then, do you propose that Bessy shall save what is left of her
money?"

"I would rather see her save what is left of her happiness. Bessy will
never be happy in the new way."

"What do you call the new way?"

"Launching one's boat over a human body--or several, as the case may
be!"

"But don't you see that, as an expedient to bring this madman to
reason----"

"I've told you that you don't understand him!"
