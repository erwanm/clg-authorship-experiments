bach, a beautiful, though not 
sublime, object. Up we began to go among those green 
undulations which form the 
lower part of the mountain. 




 

It is haying time; a bright day; all is cheerful; the birds 
sing ; men, women, and children are busy in the field. Up 
we go, zigzag ; it grows steeper and steeper. Now right below me is a field, where men are literally working almost on a 
perpendicular wall, cutting hay ; now we are so high that the 
houses in the valley look like chips. Here we stand in a 
place two thousand feet above the valley. There is no shield

that hay. But now we mount higher ; the breezy dells, en- 
amelled with flowers and grass, become fewer ; the great black 
pines take their place. Right before us, in the purest white,
