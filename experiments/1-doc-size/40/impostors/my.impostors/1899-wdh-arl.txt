generously. 

"Then you didn 't doubt me, in spite of all?" 



 

" I thought you would know what to do. No, I 
didn 't doubt you, exactly." 

" I didn 't deserve your trust ! " he cried. " How 
came that man to mention me ? " he demanded, abrupt 
ly, after a moment 's silence. 

" Mr. Belsky ? It was the first night I saw him, 
and we were talking about Americans, and he began 
to tell me about an American friend of his, who was 
very conscientious. I thought it must be you the 
fust moment," said Clementina, smiling with an im 
personal pleasure in the fact. 

" From the conscientiousness ? " he asked, in bitter 
self-irony. 

" Why, yes," she returned, simply. " That was 
what made me think of you. And the last time when 
he began to talk about you, I couldn 't stop him, al 
though I knew he had no right to." 

" He had no right. But I gave him the power to 
do it ! He meant no harm, but I enabled him to do 
all the harm." 

" Oh, if he 's only alive, now, there is no harm ! " 

He looked into her eyes with a misgiving from 
which he burst impetuously. " Then you do care for 
me still, after all that I have done to make you detest 
me ? " He started toward her, but she shrank back.
