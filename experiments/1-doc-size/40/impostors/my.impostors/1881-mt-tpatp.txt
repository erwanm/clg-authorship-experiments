The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and 
was greatly refreshed and gladdened by it. It was a 
meal which was distinguished by this curious feature, 
that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither 
recipient of the favor was aware that it had been 
extended. The goodwife had intended to feed this 
young tramp with broken victuals in a comer, like

and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do. It 
was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but 
he finished it at last. He was becoming impatient to 
get away on his journey now; however, he was not
