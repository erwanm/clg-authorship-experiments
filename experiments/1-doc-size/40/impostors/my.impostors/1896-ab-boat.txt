old-time legends to alien folk. The terms 
"uncle" and "aunt" were freely inter- 
changed among them in token of respect 
and affection ; and thus did the Virgin 
Mary come to be tenderly spoken of as 
Modryb Marya, "Aunt Mary." One 
subject, however, to this day rouses 
them to wrath, — the comparison of their 
clotted cream with the cream of Devon. 
"Ah, you can't make Cornish cream 
anywhere else ! " said a wise old woman. 
"It takes Cornish cows." That I firmly 
believe ; and yet, when in Devonshire, I

lence of Devonshire cows. There is no 
such cream as the Cornish cream save 
in Devonshire, and none like the Devon 
cream except in Cornwall. 

The coast of Cornwall is rock-bound, 
full of terrible crags, of sounding caves, 
and beaten upon by mighty surges. Yet, 
inland from its rocky strongholds, how 
the earth smiles in leaf and bloom ! In 
its valleys, on the south coast, blossoms 
a tropical wealth of flowers, quite amaz- 
ing in a country of England's latitude. 
Fuchsias, roof-high, adorn the cottage 
fronts ; scarlet geraniums and roses clam- 
ber to their very eaves. Near the Lizard 
grows the wonderful Cornish heath, 
found nowhere else but in Portugal, — 
delicate and gracious sojourner from a 
warmer clime. In the sweet freshness 
of the sea winds every petal assumes a 
brilliancy of tint unknown farther inland. 
The heather is rosier, the gorse has a 
more golden glow, foxgloves are reddened
