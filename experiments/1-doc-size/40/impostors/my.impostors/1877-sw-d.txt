'I see!' said the young man. 'I see the necessity, 
and feel the difficulty. Well, I'll be there.' 

He grasped her hand again; they had shaken hands 
before he left the house, Diana remembered ; and this time 
he held her fingers in a light clasp for some seconds after 



 

it was time to let them go. Then he turned and sprang 
upon his horse and went off at a gallop. Diana stood still 
at the gate where he had left her, looking down the road 
and listening to the diminishing sound of his horse's hoofs. 
The moonlight streamed tenderly down upon her and the 
elm trees ; it filled the empty space where Knowlton's 
figure had been ; it flickered where the elm branches stirred lightly and cast broken shadows upon the ground ; it 
poured its floods of effulgence over the meadows and 
distant hills, in still moveless peace and power of everlasting calm. It was one of the minutes of Diana's life that she 
never forgot afterwards ; a point where her life had stood 
still still as the moonlight ; and almost as sweet in its 
broad restfulness. She lingered at the gate, and came 
slowly back again into the house. 

' What are you going to take to Bear hill, mother ? ' in-quired Diana the next day. 

' I don't know ! I declare, I'm 'most tired of picnics ; 
they cost more thar they come to. If we could tackle up 
now, and go off by ourselves, early some morning, and get 
what we want there'd be some fun in that.' 

' It's a very lonely place, mother.' 

' That's what I say. I'm tired o' livin' forever in a crowd.' 

' But you said you'd go ? ' 

'Well ; I'm goin'.'
