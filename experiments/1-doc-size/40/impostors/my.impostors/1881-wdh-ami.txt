 

She feigned an angry impatience with the condition 
of things ; but when her father went out, she joined 
her mother in earnest conjectures as to what Ben had 
on his mind. 

Halleck wandered about till nearly ten o clock, and 
then he went to the little house on Clover Street. 
The servant-girl answered his ring, and when he 
asked for Mrs. Hubbard, she said that Mr. Hubbard 
wished to see him, and please would he step upstairs. 

He found Bartley seated at the window, with a wet 
towel round his head, and his face pale with head 
ache. 

" Well, old man," he said, with an assumption of 
comradery that was nauseous to Halleck, " you 've 
done the handsome thing by me. I know all about 
it. I knew something about it all the time." He 
held out his hand, without rising, and Halleck forced 
himself to touch it. " I appreciate your delicacy in 
not telling my wife. Of course you could rit tell," 
he said, with depraved enjoyment of what he con 
ceived of Halleck 's embarrassment. " But I guess 
she must have smelt a rat. As the fellow says," he 
added, seeing the disgust that Halleck could not keep 
out of his face, " I shall make a clean breast of it, as 
soon as she can bear it. She 's pretty high-strung. 
Lying down, now," he explained. " You sSfe, I went 
out to get something to make me sleep, and the first 
thing I knew I had got too much. Good thing I 
turned up on your doorstep ; might have been waltz 
ing into the police court about now. How did you 
happen to hear me ? " 

Halleck briefly explained, with an air of abhorrence 
for the facts.
