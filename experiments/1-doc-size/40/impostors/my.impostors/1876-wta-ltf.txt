without my giving some notice, so that the officers can get another
person in my place.”
“It would be mean in them to keep you when you have a good chance to
better your condition.”
“I think I can manage it somehow, Lilian; and I feel almost sure that
we shall go.”
“O, I am so glad!”
“But, Lilian, you must not tell a single soul where you are going, or,
indeed, that you are going at all.”
“Not tell any one! Why not?” she asked, as if it would be a great
hardship to deprive herself of the pleasure of telling her friends that

than not go at all.”
I am willing to confess that my conscience reproached me for thus
deceiving my loving wife; but I believed that I was doing it for her
good—to save her from a fate so terrible that neither of us could
comprehend it. We discussed the details of the plan in full, and
she promised to be as circumspect as I could desire. We had two
traveling trunks which we had used upon our bridal tour, and these
were immediately brought into requisition. Leaving Lilian to commence
packing, I left the house with the intention of seeing Mr. Brentbone,
who had so long been anxious to have my house. I found him at his
lodgings. I stated my business, and inquired if he still wished to
