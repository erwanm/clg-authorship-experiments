that the third person was a nun a large-eyed, fragile little 
creature, promptly introduced by Melvyna, the keeper's wife, 



 

as "Sister St. Luke." For the keeper's wife, in spite of her 
black eyes, was not a Minorcan ; not even a Southerner. 
Melvyna Sawyer was born in Vermont, and, by one of the 
strange chances of this vast, many-raced, motley country of 
ours, she had traveled south as nurse and a very good, en

receiving a fee, gave one, which Melvyna, however, promptly 
rescued from the bridegroom's willing hand, and returned 
with the remark that there was no "call for alms" (pro
