Leopold, quietly, as he began to move towards the boat.

"I was looking on when you found it, Leopold; and it's the rule, you
see, in such cases, to divy. I was here when you unearthed the thing."

"No, you were not," answered Leopold, decidedly. "I dug it before you
came to Rockhaven."

"I don't claim any share of it," Stumpy put in. "Le didn't find it by
accident. No part of it belongs to me, and I don't ask for a dollar of
the money."

"O, you don't!" exclaimed Mr. Redmond; "then Leopold and I will divy
even, you see; half to each."

"We shall not divide at all," added the skipper of the Rosabel, who had
by this time reached the flat rock where the sloop was made fast.

"See here, Leopold; do I understand you to say that you are going to
keep the whole?" asked Charley Redmond, very seriously. "That would be
mean, you see. It would be the way a swine would do that sort of thing."

"I don't intend to divide at all, or to keep it myself. It don't belong
to me any more than it does to you," protested Leopold.

"Didn't you find it?"

"Of course I did."

"Then it belongs to you."

"Not at all. If you pick up a pocket-book in the street of New York,
does it belong to you, or to the one that lost it?"

"That's another sort of a thing, you see. This is money buried on the
sea-shore by Captain Kidd, or some of those swells of pirates. It don't
belong to anybody, you see."

"This gold was not buried by pirates."
