Patricia Mason. And now he adopted his nation's Capital at once.

His answer was favorable, and he hurried to his sweetheart with all
impatience, though he had been cool enough before. And she accepted
him, as any sensible girl with a strong liking for a young man every
way worthy of her regard was likely to do. Jane was called in presently
to rejoice with them.

"Oh, Patty!" she exclaimed afterward, kissing her enthusiastically,
"it's just a splendid marriage! I'm so glad to keep you in Washington!

delightful letter; I wish I had kept it to show you. And he says
Jaqueline and I must come home soon. Perhaps he will be up next week."
