" Good evening, Aleck !" she said, putting her hand con 
fidingly in his, outstretched with an air of brotherly fondness he could not have shown her a year ago. " I am glad 
that you are home again. Did you remember that it was 
Christmas Eve ?" 

" Remember !" thought he, with an inward groan. He 
smiled pleasantly at the querist. "Is that the reason you 
have made yourself so fine to-night, Lily ?" 

" Yes ! Sally got the holly for me, for I thought I had 
heard that people wore it on Christmas Eve. It looks pretty, 
doesn't it ?" 

" Very !" replied Helen, cheerfully. 

Lily surveyed herself in the mirror with unaffected and 
guileless complacency. 

" And to-morrow night, Sally is to get me some orange- 
buds. I made her promise, if you had no objection, Aleck. 
There are plenty in the green-house." 

" Why should I object ?" asked Aleck. " The flowers be 
long to you and Nelly here, not to me." 

" Yes, but I had a notion that you did not like orange- 
blossoms ; or was it you, Nelly ?" 

" Neither of us, I think," she responded. " It was all a 
notion, little one." 

" It makes me very happy to hear you say so, for, do you 



know, I wouldn't miss wearing them on Christmas night on 
any account," sinking her voice to a mysterious whisper. 
" Who was it, Nelly, that told me that it would be a terrible 
thing not to wear orange-blossoms on Christmas ?"
