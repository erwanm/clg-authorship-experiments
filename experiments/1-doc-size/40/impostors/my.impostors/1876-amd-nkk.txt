their mother," he said huskily ; " and yet you are such a 
child yourself. No, I must not make the burthen too 
heavy. I suspect I am something of a coward and a 
shirk myself," he appended grimly. " I ought to take 
the responsibility of my body ." 

" I think you ought," returned Nelly gravely. 

' ' But I had promised myself a sort of holiday house 
hold life," he continued with a shrug and a half-smile. 

"Barton, life isn't all meant for a holiday. We have 
had a verj* bright golden one ; and now I want you to let 
me help yOU with the work. Bertie needs a father's care 
and interest and love. Let him come a little more into 
your life. It will b,e a trouble, I know ; but it brings 
with it a sweet reward. I wouldn't give up my remem 
brance of papa's sympathy and tenderness for all the 
wealth of the world." 

" Mr. Endicott is a better man than I," said Dr. Kin- 
nard simply. Then, with a smile, "I hope you have 
brought a little of his goodness with you to leaven us ; for 
we all need it." 

He sat down, and took her on his knee, holding the fair 
hand in his, and resting his chin upon it. 

" What will you do with Bertie? " she asked presently. 

" It puzzles me. The bracelet has certainly been 
stepped upon. Just falling from a table could not injure 
it in that manner. It seems as if Bertie ought to have 
told you the truth. And, if he should persist in his state 
ment, Aunt Adelaide will not believe it I am afraid. So 
I am between two fires."
