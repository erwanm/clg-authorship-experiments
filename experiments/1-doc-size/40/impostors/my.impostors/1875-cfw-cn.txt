Beyond the palace began the Community garden, a 
large square in the centre of the village filled with 
flowers and fruit, adorned with arbors and cedar-trees 
clipped in the form of birds, and enriched with an old- 
style greenhouse whose sliding glasses were viewed 
with admiration by the visitors of thirty years ago, 
who sent their choice plants thither from far and near 
to be tended through the long, cold lake-country win- 
ters. The garden, the cedars, and the greenhouse were 
all antiquated, but to me none the less charnting. The 
spring that gushed up in one corner, the old-fashioned 
flowers in their box-bordered 'beds, larkspur, lady slip- 
pers, bachelor's buttons, peonies, aromatic pinks, and 
all varieties of roses, the arbors with red honeysuckle 
overhead and tan bark under foot, were all delightful ; 
and I knew, also, that I should find the gardener's 
daughter at her never-ending task of weeding. This 
time it was the strawberry bed. " I have come to sit 
in your pleasant garden, Mina," I said, taking a seat 
on a shaded bench near the bending figure. 

" So ? " said Wilhelinina in long-drawn interroga- 
tion, glancing up shyly with a smile. She was a child 
of the sun, this little maiden, and while her blond 



 

companions wore always their bonnets or broad- 
brimmed hats over their precise caps, Wilhelmina, as 
now, constantly discarded these coverings and sat in 
the sun basking like a bird of the tropics. In truth, 
it did not redden her; she was one of those whose 
coloring comes not from without, but within. 

" Do you like this work, Mina ? " 

"O so. Good as any."
