tenderness of savorous flesh. She was not carnal, but she was hungry and
at her home latterly the food had been vile.

The Tamburini, with enigmatic ideas in the back of her head, ate her
horrible dish very delicately, her little finger crooked. But she drank
nobly.

Paliser too had ideas which, however, were not enigmatic in the least
and not in the back of his head either. They concerned two young women,
one of whom was patently engaged to Lennox and the other probably in
love with him. The situation appealed to this too charming young man to
whom easy conquests were negligible.

He had been looking at Cassy. On the table was a vase in which there
were flowers. He took two of them and looked again at the girl.

"Sunday is always hateful. Couldn't you both dine with me here?"

The former prima donna wiped her loose mouth. She could, she would, and
she said so.

Paliser put the flowers before Cassy.

"Le parlate d'amor," the ex-diva began and, slightly for a moment, her
deep voice mounted.

Cassy turned on her. "You're an imbecile."

With an uplift of the chin--a family habit--Paliser summoned the waiter.
While he was paying him, Cassy protested. She had nothing to wear.

She had other objections which she kept to herself. If it had been
Lennox she would have had none at all. But it was not Lennox. It was a
man whom she had never seen before and who was entirely too free with
his eyes.

"Come as you are," said the Tamburini, who massively stood up.

Paliser also was rising. "Let me put you in a cab and on Sunday----"
