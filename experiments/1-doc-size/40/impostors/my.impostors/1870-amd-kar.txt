Kathie was a very humble little girl, and she 
thought now of the many times she might have been 
useful to her mother when she had gone to play 
instead. But latterly she had tried. 
 
When they returned, for Mrs. Gardiner was not 
strong enough for a very long drive, the two little 
girls sat on the piazza in their clean gingham dresses 
and white aprons. 
" Mrs. Gardiner, can't they go a little while ? " 
asked Kathie, with great earnestness. 
" I am afraid we shall trespass on your kindness, 
my dear child." 
" no. It will be such fun for us all." 
"And you think your mother wouldn't disap- 
prove ? ' was Mrs. Gardiner's doubtful question. 
" I am very sure." 
Lucy and Annie were overjoyed. They were as 
gay as little larks, quite as noisy too when they 
were out of hearing. They passed several of the 
school-girls, and Lottie Thome and her mother trudg- 
ing along on foot. Lottie gave them a disdainful 
nod. 
" You don't care, do you ? J: said Annie. " But 
Lottie is going to the sea-shore, and she has ever 
so many pretty new dresses." 
" I 'd a good deal rather have a pony," said Lucy. 
" This is just splendid." 
Kathie thought so too as the ponies trotted along. 
 
As for sea-side, there was beautiful Silver Lake, 
and their pretty house was nicer than any hotel. 
So they laughed and talked, and enjoyed them^ 
selves to the utmost. Once or twice when Kathie 
would have turned they begged her to go just a 
little bit farther, and when they reached home they 
were surprised to find it so late. Mrs. Gardiner was 
lying down, but she declared herself much refreshed. 
" Indeed, I feel as if I should get up to-morrow and 
go to work," she said, laughingly.
