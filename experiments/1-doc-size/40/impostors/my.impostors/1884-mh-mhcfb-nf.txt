Turn out, and when cold, flavor with vanilla and put into glasses.

Whip the whites of three eggs to a smooth méringue, beat in three
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and heap upon the brown mixture.


Chocolate Blanc-mange.

(Our French scholars will say that this should be termed
“Brun-mange.”)

Mix with the soaked gelatine four heaping tablespoonfuls of Baker’s
chocolate, grated, and stir into the scalding milk, and treat as
above directed. In straining, squeeze the bag hard to extract all the
coloring matter. Flavor with vanilla.


Coffee Blanc-mange.

Soak the gelatine in a cupful of strong, clear black coffee, instead of
the cold water, and proceed as with plain blanc-mange, using no other
flavoring than the coffee.


Tea Blanc-mange

Is made in the same way by substituting for the water very strong,
mixed tea. Eat with powdered sugar and cream.


Pineapple Trifle.

    One package of gelatine.

    Two cups of white sugar.

    One small pineapple, peeled and cut into bits.

    One-half teaspoonful of nutmeg.
