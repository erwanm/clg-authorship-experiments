put a stop to the conversation. The minister 
waited, and she struggled. 

" Why could you not do what the others 
did, Matilda?" 

" Mr. Richmond I didn't want to do the 
things." 

" What things ? Bringing new scholars to 
the Sunday school, for instance ? " 




" O no, sir, I wouldn't mind doing that, or 
some other things either. Bat " 

" You mean, you do not want to pledge 
yourself to be a servant of the Lord Jesus 
Christ?" 

" NO, sir ; " after a pause, and low. 

"Well, Tilly," said the minister, "I can 
only be very sorry for you. You keep yourself out of a great joy." 

" But, Mr. Richmond," said Matilda, down 
whose cheeks quiet tears were now running, 
one after another, "don't you think I am very 
young yet to be a member of the church ? " 

" Do you think Jesus died for you, Tilly ? " 

" Yes, sir." 

" Do you believe he loves you now ? " 

" Yes, sir."
