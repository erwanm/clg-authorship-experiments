He had assumed a virtue and enjoyed assuming it, and the 
assumption had cheated his father and his mother and his 
affianced wife and his rich benefactor and the candid burgesses 
of Harsh and the cynical reporters of the newspapers. His 
enthusiasms had been but young curiosity, his speeches had 
been young agility, his professions and adhesions had been 
like postage-stamps without glue : the head was all right, but 
they wouldn't stick. He stood ready now to wring the neck 
of the irrepressible vice which certainly would like nothing 
better than to get him into further trouble. His only real 
justification would be to turn patience (his .own, of course) 
inside ou<; ; yet if there should be a way to misread that recipe 
his humbugging genius could be trusted infallibly to discover 
it. Cheap and easy results would dangle before him, little 
amateurish conspicuities, helped by his history, at exhibitions ; 
putting it in his power to triumph with a quick "What do 
you say to that ? " over those he had wounded. The fear of 
this danger was corrosive ; it poisoned even legitimate joys. 
If he should have a striking picture at the Academy next 
year it wouldn't be a crime : yet he couldn't help suspecting 
any conditions that would enable him to be striking so soon. 
In this way he felt quite enough how Gabriel Nash " had " 
him whenever he railed at his fever for proof, and how 
inferior as a productive force the desire to win over the ill- 
disposed might be to the principle of quiet growth. Nash had 
a foreign manner of lifting up his finger and waving it before 
him, as if to put an end to everything, whenever it became, 
in conversation or discussion, to any extent a question whether 
any one would like anything. 

It was presumably, in some degree at least, a due respect 
for the principle of quiet growth that kept Nick on the spot 
at present, made him stick fast to Rosedale Road and Calcutta 
Gardens and deny himself the simplifications of absence. Do 
what he would he could not despoil himself of the impression
