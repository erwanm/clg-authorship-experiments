things I consider right, I can at least refrain from 
some I know to be deadly wrong. And this matter 
of drinking is one. If the taste of it fills you with 
desire, then you must not drink at all. I think I 
would make a resolve for six months, at least. It 
has been the cause of all your troubles so far. It 
keeps you at poverty's door, it throws you out of 
situations, it loses friends and trust and respect. 
It may not kill you speedily, but you might better 
a thousand times be dead. And your example acts 
upon others. You encourage them every time you 
drink. Some younger lad may lay his sin and 
weakness at your door." 

"I never thought of it in that light. Oh, I 
wish I could stop ! God knows I wish I could 
stop ! "

" You raw, Joe. Just think as strongly and 
surely that you can, as that the temptation has so 
much more power than your own will and your own 
soul. What you want is real backbone. All the 
resolves in the world will not save you. It is a 
great fight with the powers of evil, and God will 
help you ; but he doesn't keep you in spite of your 
self. You must act. Nothing saves you against 



 

your own self. If you are looking for that, you may 
as well hurry to a drunkard's grave at once." 

" But, oh ! what am I to do ? " he pleaded.
