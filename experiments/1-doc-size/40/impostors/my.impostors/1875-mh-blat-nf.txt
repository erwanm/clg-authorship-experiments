  ½ pound of sugar,  } rubbed to a cream.
3 eggs, beaten long and light.
1 ounce carraway seeds, sifted through the flour.
Flour to roll out pretty stiff.
Roll into a thin sheet; cut out with a cake-cutter; prick with a sharp
fork, and bake in a moderate oven.
SMALL ALMOND CAKES.
1 pound of powdered sugar.
6 eggs, beaten very light.
½ pound of almonds, blanched and pounded.
½ pound of prepared flour.
Rose-water, mixed with the almond-paste.
Whip up the whites of the eggs to a méringue with half the sugar;
stir in the almond-paste. Beat the yolks ten minutes with the remainder
of the sugar. Mix all together, and add the flour lightly and rapidly.
Bake in well-buttered paté-pans, or other small tins, very quickly.
Turn out as soon as done upon a baking-pan, bottom uppermost, that
these may dry out.
CREAM CAKES. + (Pretty and good.)
Some good puff-paste.
Whites of 2 eggs, ½ cup sweet jelly.
1 cup of cream, whipped to a froth.
3 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.
Vanilla, or other flavoring.
Roll out the paste as for pies; cut into squares five inches across.
Have ready greased muffin-rings three inches in diameter; lay one in
the centre of each square; turn up the four corners upon it, so as to
make a cup of the paste, and bake in a quick oven. When almost done,
open the oven-door, pull out the muffin-rings with care, brush the
paste cups inside and out with beaten white of egg; sift powdered sugar
over them, and brown. This operation must be performed quickly and
dexterously, that the paste may not cool. Let them get cold after they
are taken from the oven, line with the jelly and fill with the whipped
cream sweetened and flavored.
CUSTARD CAKES. +
Some good puff-paste.
Some balls of white, clean tissue-paper.
3 or 4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.
2 eggs.
2 cups—more or less, of rich custard.
