6 eggs.

1 cup of chicken, game, or veal gravy.

1 teaspoonful mixed parsley and onion, chopped fine.

1 handful very fine bread-crumbs.

Pepper and salt to taste.

Pour enough gravy into a neat baking-dish to cover the bottom well,
and mix with the rest the parsley and onion. Set the dish in the oven
until the gravy begins to hiss and bubble, when break the eggs into it,
so that they do not crowd one another. Strew bread-crumbs thickly over
them, pepper and salt, and return to the oven for three minutes longer.
Then pour the rest of the gravy, which should be hot, over the whole.
More bread-crumbs, as fine as dust, and bake until the eggs are “set.”

Send to table in the baking-dish.

This dish will be found very savory.


FRICASSEED EGGS. +

6 hard-boiled eggs. When cold, slice with a sharp knife, taking care
not to break the yolk.

1 cup good broth, well seasoned with pepper, salt, parsley and a
suspicion of onion.

Some rounds stale bread, fried to a light-brown in butter or nice
dripping.

Put the broth on the fire in a saucepan with the seasoning and let it
come to a boil. Rub the slices of egg with melted butter, then roll
them in flour. Lay them gently in the gravy and let this become smoking
hot upon the side of the range, but do not let it actually boil, lest
the eggs should break. They should lie thus in the gravy for at least
