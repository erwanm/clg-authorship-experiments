" I want two places in the diligence, coupe," &c., &c., 
says the American. 

This remark being lost on the official, I explain to 
him as well as I can what is wanted, at first, — two places 
in the coupe. 

" One is taken," is his reply. 

" The gentleman will take two," I said, having in mind 
the diligence in the yard, with three places in the coupe. 

" One is taken," be repeats. 

" Then the gentleman will take the other two." 

" One is taken ! " he cries, jumping up and smiting the 
table, — " one is taken, I tell you ! " 

" How many are there in the coupe ? ** 

''Two." 

" Oh ! then the gentleman will take the one remaining 
in the coupe, and the one on top." 

So it is arranged. When I come back to the hotel, the 
Americans are explaining to the lively waiter " who 
speaks English " that they are to go in the diligence at 
half-past five, and that they are to be called at half-past 
four, and have breakfast. He knows all about it, — 
" Diligence, half-past four, breakfast. Oh, yaas ! " While 
I have been at the diligence-office, my companions have 
secured rooms, and gone to them ; and I ask the waiter to 
show me to my room. First, however, I tell him that we 
three, two ladies and myself, who came together, are 
going in the diligence at half-past five, and want to be 
called, and have breakfast. Did he comprehend ?
