the first thing, when I had heard so much about you." 

"A big boy's enthusiasm over some one older than 
himself, who forgets for the nonce how old she really is. 
I liked Bertram very much. I wish we had come soon 
enough to see him again." 

" I suppose it was foolish to care so much about a 




boy's letters. But I was awfully disappointed about not 
coming home. You see father was not so enthusiastic 
about my going to Germany, so I suppose he thought it 
would be a good discipline for me to stay until my time 
was up." 

"And was it? " 

There was a mischievous suggestion in her tone. 
" I suppose it was. Good things are not always pleas- 
ant. Yet I don't see why they should not have been 
made pleasant, for then it would be easier to be good. 
The friction helps to wear out life." 

" Is that German collegiate reasoning ? " 
"It is my reasoning, fresh from Germany." 
Both laughed a little. 

" However, it has helped me to make up my mind. I 
am afraid I shall disappoint father a little. And he is 
such a comfortable father, too. Do you know, Miss Mau- 
rice, that is one of the most fascinating words in the lan- 
guage?" 

« What— comfortable ? " 
" Yes. Think of all it expresses." 
"At peace with all men. Surrounded by numerous 
satisfactions. Happy in your inmost soul."
