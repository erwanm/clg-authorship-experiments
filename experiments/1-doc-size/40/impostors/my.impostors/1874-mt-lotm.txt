eighty columns in all; fifteen hundred words to the 
column; an aggregate of four hundred and twenty 
thousand words. That is to say, not much short of 
three times as many words as are in this book. One 
may with sorrow contrast this with the architecture of 
New Orleans. 

I have been speaking of public architecture only. 
The domestic article in New Orleans is reproachless, 
notwithstanding it remains as it always was. All the 
dwellings are of wood, — in the American part of the 
town, I mean, — and all have a comfortable look. 
Those in the wealthy quarter are spacious; painted 
snow-white usually, and generally have wide verandas, 
or double verandas, supported by ornamental columns. 
These mansions stand in the center of large grounds, 
and rise, garlanded with roses, out of the midst of 
swelling masses of shining green foliage and many- 
colored blossoms. No houses could well be in better 
harmony with their surroundings, or more pleasing to 
the eye, or more homelike and comfortable-looking. 

One even becomes reconciled to the cistern pres- 
ently; this is a mighty cask, painted green, and some- 
times a couple of stories high, which is propped against 
the house-corner on stilts. There is a mansion-and- 
brewery suggestion about the combination which seems 
very incongruous at first. But the people cannot have 
wells, and so they take rain-water. Neither can they 
conveniently have cellars or graves,* the town being 
built upon " made ” ground ; so they do without both, 
and few of the living complain, and none of the others. 

The Israelites are buried in graves — by permission, I tales it, not 
requirement; but none else, except the destitute, who are buried at public 
expense. The graves are but three or four feet deep.
