is a thing I see my finer alternative to. The 
great thing, the great find, I really think, for 
the moment, is this fact of his having gone to 
her in a sort of still preserved uncertainty of light 
that amounts virtually to darkness, and then 
after a time with her coming away with the un- 
certainty dispelled and the remarkable light in-

form and climax — in respect to the "way" that 
has most perplexed me, and gathers my action 
up to the fulness so proposed and desired; to 
the point after which I want to make it workable 
that there shall be but two Books left. In other

and X. But why not ? Who's afraid ? and what
