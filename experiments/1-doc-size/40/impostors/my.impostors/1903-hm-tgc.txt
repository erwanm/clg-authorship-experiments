"Laughter has a pleasant sound in my ears, Paul," said Victor; "and I
have not heard you laugh in some time."

"Perhaps the thought has not occurred to me," replied the Chevalier,
glancing at the entrance to the palisade.  Madame had only that moment
passed through, having left the vicomte.  "I have lost the trick of
laughing.  No thought of mine is spontaneous.  With a carpenter's ell I
mark out each thought; it is all edges and angles."

"Something must be done, then, to make you laugh.  Madame and
mademoiselle have promised to take a canoe trip back into the hills
this afternoon.  Come with us."

"They suggested . . . ?" the Chevalier stammered.

"No.  But haven't you the right?  At least you know madame."

"Madame?"

"Madame, always madame.  Here formalities would only be ridiculous.
You will go with us for safety's sake, if for nothing more."

"I will go . . . with that understanding.  Ah, lad, if only I knew what
you know!"

"We should still be where we are," evasively.  The poet had a plan in

Caprice is an exquisite trait in a woman; a woman who has it--and what
woman has not?--is all the seasons of the year compressed into an
hour--the mildness of spring, the warmth of summer, the glory of
autumn, and the chill of winter.  And when madame saw the Chevalier
that afternoon, she put a foot into the canoe, and immediately withdrew
it.
