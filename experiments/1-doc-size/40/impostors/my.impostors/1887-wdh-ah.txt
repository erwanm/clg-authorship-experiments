blot on this day.”

“Oh, well, it isn’t very much of a blot, and I can easily wipe it off.
I’ll tell you what, Alice! I can write to Mrs. Frobisher, when our

“I met them on Class Day, and then I saw them--the day after I left
Campobello.” Dan laughed a little.

“How, saw them?”

“Well, I went to a yacht race with them. I happened to meet them in the
street, and they wanted me to go; and I was all broken up, and--I Went.”

“Oh!” said Alice. “The day after I--you left Campobello?”

“Did he know the ladies? Did he go too?”

“No. He was there to report the race for the Events. He went on the
press boat.”

“Oh!” said Alice. “Was there a large party?”
