upon him, grind him to powder in his fury. Ah, thank 
God that Theo will never have to face that ! though a 
t3Tant has fallen to many a good woman’s lot before 
this. 

Mr. Sargent goes briefly over the case. Mr. Ross 
listens in a bravado of contempt, his handsome lips 
parted into a half-smile. Then he steps forward a little. 

“ Mr. Quinlan,” he says with the very irony of calm- 
ness, “ were you present at my marriage, or did you ever 
have speech with aiy one who was ? ’ ’ 

“No,” hesitatingly, and nervously picking the edge of 
his coat. 

“ Did you ever see my marriage-lines ? ” 

“ No ; but you must have been married.” 

Talk about the consciousness of guilt ! Mr. Quinlan 
might be guilt personified ; Mr. Ross, triumphant truth. 
His attitude is brave, fearless ; his face full of haughty 
disdain, one foot half crossed over the other, and his tall, 
fine figure displacing the superb ease of indifference. 

“Then, Mr. Quinlan,” in a measured voice, “ you 
know nothing about it ! I have no wife but Theo Durant, 
whom I married in St. John’s Church. Would I have 
dared to do such a thing pubhcly, where any one might 


 


rise and forbid it ? Do you think me fool enough to run 
such a risk ? ’ ’ 

No, he does not look like it. Ah, God ! what if Theo 
is still his lawful, miserable wife.
