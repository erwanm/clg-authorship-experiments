most un-Californian of Californians seem to his 
Arcadian eyes a being of a higher star. And 
hatred blazed forth anew. 

As the men rose, finally, to go to the drawing-room, 
he asked Estenega to remain for q 
moment. " Thou wilt keep thy promise soon, 
no ? " he said when they were alone, 

" What promise?" 

' ' Thy promise to send me as diputado to the 
next Mexican Congress." 

Estenega looked at him reflectively. He had 
little toleration for the man of inferior brain, 
and, although he did not underrate his power 
for mischief, he relied upon his own wit to cir- 
cumvent him. He had disposed of this one by 
warning Santa Ana, and he concluded to be 
annoyed by him no further. Besides, as a 
brother-in-law, he would be insupportable ex- 
cept at the long range of mutual unamiability. 

" I made you no promise," he said, deliber- 
ately ; " and I shall make you none. I do not 
wish you in the city of Mexico." 

Reinaldo's face grew livid. '* Thou darest to 
say that to me, and yet would marry my sister? " 

''I would, and I shall." 
y "And yet thou wouldst not help her brother ?" 

" Her brother is less to me than any .man 
with whom I have sat to-night. Build no 
hopes on that. You will stay at Santa Barbara 
and play the grand seigneur, which suits you 
very well, or become a prisoner in your own 
house." And he left the room.
