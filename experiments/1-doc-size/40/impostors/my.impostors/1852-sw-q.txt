it would be safe for her to answer his question,  a kind of
exploring look, in which her eyes often acted as scouts for
her tongue. Those she met pledged their faith for her
security; yet Fleda's look went back to the square and then
again to his face in silence.

"How do you like living in Paris?" said he. "You should know
by this time."

"I like it very much indeed," said Fleda.

"I thought you would."

"I like Queechy better, though," she went on, gravely, her
eyes turning again to the square.

"Like Queechy better! Were you thinking of Queechy just now
when I spoke to you?"

"O no!"  with a smile.

"Were you going over all those horrors I have been distressing
you with?"

"No," said Fleda; "I was thinking of them, a while ago."

"What then?" said he pleasantly. "You were looking so sober, I
should like to know how near your thoughts were to mine."

"I was thinking," said Fleda, gravely, and a little
unwillingly, but Guy's manner was not to be withstood  "I was
wishing I could be like the disciple whom Jesus loved."

Mr. Carleton let her see none of the surprise he felt at this
answer.

"Was there one more loved than the rest?"

"Yes  the Bible calls him 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.'
That was John."
