20th of August. Then the weather turned warm again, 
and held fine till the beginning of October, within a 
week of the time when Jackson was to sail. It had 
not been so hard to make him consent when he knew 
where the doctor wished him to go, and he had will- 
ingly profited by Westover's suggestions about getting 
to Egypt. His interest in the matter, which he tried 
to hide at first under a mask of decorous indiflEerence, 
mounted with the fire of Whitwell's enthusiasm, and 
they held nightly councils together, studying his course 
on the map, and consulting planohette upon the points 
at variance that rose between them, while Jombateeste 
sat with his chair tilted against the wall, and pulled 
steadily at his pipe, which mixed its strong fumes with 
the smell of the kerosene lamp and the perennial odor 
of potatoes in the cellar under the low room where the 
companions forgathered. 

Towards the end of September Westover spent the 
night before he went back to town with them. After 
a season with planchette, their host pushed himself 
back with his knees from the table till his chair reared 
upon its hind-legs, and shoved his hat up from his 
forehead in token of a philosophical mood. 

"I tell you, Jackson," he said, "you'd ought to 
get hold o' some them occult devils out there, and 
squeeze their science out of 'em. Any Buddhists in 
Egypt, Mr. Westover?" 

" I don't think there are," said Westover. "Un- 
less Jackson should come across some wandering Hin- 
doo. Or he might push on, and come home by the 
way of India."
