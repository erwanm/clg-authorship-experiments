when Frank Whitwell made off with this message for 
delivery in such decent terms as he could imagine for 
it, Jeff said, rather to himself than to Westover, " I 
don't see how we're going to run this hotel with that 
old family lot down there in the orchard, much 
longer." 
He assumed the air of full authority at Lion's 
Head ; and Westover felt the stress of a painful con- 
jecture in regard to the Whitwells intensified upon 
him from the moment he turned away from Jackson's 
grave. 
Cynthia and her father had gone back to their own 
house as soon as Jeff returned, and though the girl 
came home with Mrs. Durgin after the funeral, and 
helped her in their common duties through the after- 
noon and evening, Westover saw her taking her way 
 
down the liill with lier brother when the long day's 
work was over. Jeff saw her too ; he was sitting with 
Westover at the office door smoking, and he was talk- 
ing of the Whitwells. 
" I suppose they won't stay," he said, " and I can't 
expect it ; but I don't know what mother will do, ex- 
actly." 
At the same moment Whitwell came round the cor- 
ner of the hotel from the barn, and approached them. 
" Jeff, I guess I better tell you straight off that we're 
goin', the children and me." 
"All right, Mr. Whitwell," said Jeff, with respect- 
ful gravity, " I was afraid of it." 
Westover made a motion to rise, but Whitwell laid 
a detaining hand upon his knee. "There ain't any- 
thing so private about it, so far as I know." 
" Don't go, Mr. Westover," said Jeff, and Westover 
remained. 
"We a'n't a-goin' to leave you in the lurch, and 
we want you should take your time, especially Mis' 
Durgin. But the sooner the better. Heigh ? " 
"Yes, I understand that, Mr. Whitwell; I guess 
mother will miss you, but if you must go, you must."
