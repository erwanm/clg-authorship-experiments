is beautifully furnished. But we shall not keep a 
carriage or give swell parties, though we may have 



 

afternoon teas and all that sort of thing. We 
have had two dainty little dinners already, the 
guests being friends of papa's. I'm not crowded 
out of one thing rightly mine, and she stands 
ready to give me any pleasure. But it is the love. 
He has only eyes for her. He almost forgets I 
am there. And it is so hard, when I had dreamed 
of being first." 

Thirza could almost have smiled at the girl's 
jealous sense of loss. It was hard, and yet inevi 
table. 

" They don't need me ! " she cried with a regret 
ful passion. " They never will again. Why, even 
papa can make a jest about my marrying, and that 
is all that is left," drearily. " Oh, Thirza, I have 
been thinking for days ; I envy you and your 
friends. You have something of real interest. If 
I were a genius, which I am not, and I can under 
stand how a poor girl who must work or starve 
can be doing second or third rate, but I would 
have no such excuse. If I am thrown on my own 
life, I must make a life of my own, not dawdle 
through tiresome days." 

" Oh, there is plenty of work if you mean real 
work " and Thirza suddenly checked herself. 
Were there not duties as well ? Had she a right 
to advise this young soul until she knew better 
how matters really were with her ?
