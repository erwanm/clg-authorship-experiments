fess my delight at once. Indeed, you have occu 
pied a good share of my thoughts, I must admit, 
I have heard such conflicting accounts of you. At 
first you were bent on ruining Westhorpe with 
your railroad and improvements. And now the 
railroad connection is what the town has needed 
for years, and as the mill and the businesses of vari- 
 
ous kinds are advancing the material interests of 
the place, I think you are quite forgiven. Or is 
it the ingratitude of towns ? " 
" You would hardly know us. You missed us 
altogether this summer." 
" Yes ; I had a certain inward assurance that you 
would not need me. And Westhorpe was unusu 
ally gay, my sister wrote. Are you in the con 
spiracy of the new hotel ? " 
" Oh, no. I am not the head and front of all 
offending. Elm Avenue has been straightened 
and made wider at the upper end, and here the 
new hotel is to stand. We are waking out of our 
Rip Van Winkle nap." 
" Are you quite sure you will not spoil the 
beautiful old town? We ought to have some 
places full of dreamy comfort when life presses 
too hard." 
" The old part will be left undisturbed. The 
new part will stretch out on the opposite side of 
the river. Yes, I should be sorry to see any 
great change in those streets that have grown up 
with the sacredness of homes and memories cen 
turies old. But the world forges on, and we must 
join the procession or drop into stupor and decay. 
There will be enough left for you to recognize the 
place, unless you should stay away too long. But 
I half envied you your journey on the other side 
 
of our great continent. It is one of the hopes in 
store for me. You and Miss Otis must have 
enjoyed it to the full."
