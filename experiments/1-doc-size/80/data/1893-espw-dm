Donald, not without a secret anxiousness 
perfectly new to him. " Don't distress 
yourself. I will see Uncle Francis to-night, 
and talk it all over. Never fear, mother. 





You shall be looked after, at all events. 
I 'll take care of you ! " 

" I shall have to go to Newport, anyway" 
wept Mrs. Marcy. "You know I should 
not live the summer out, in any other air. 
Then there 's Dr. Hellingpfeiffer 's annual 
fee ; the sum your father always has paid 
him gives me a claim, a priority. I secure 
his services by the year, and he is always to 
be had when my attacks come on. It would 
be impossible to economize on the doctor. 
Oh, what, what will become of me ? " she 
wailed. 

" Don't cry, mother. Don't you fear. 
I'll look after you," repeated Donald man 
fully. But his eye, warned by a sudden 
new intelligence, traveled around the sick 
room, whose luxurious appointments were so 
much a matter of course to him that he had 
never given a thought to them before, in all 
his life. The heavy velvet carpet ; the ex 
pensive patent springs on the doors to pre 
vent a slam, or jar, or creak ; the long, satin 
draperies, hanging from the great, plate - 
glass windows, like the trains of princesses ; 
the exquisite shades for shielding the eyes ; 
the fold upon fold of satin and " real " lace 
covering the bed, the pillows, the couch, and 



 

the nightdress of the invalid which showed 
becomingly* beneath her embroidered sack ; 
the eider-down robes, silk-covered, used as 
freely as less wealthy people use blankets ; 
the inlaid invalid 's tray and table ; the silver
and Sevres upon it ; the high-waged 
figure of Maria in the doorway; the new 
maid in the other room, dusting a statuette 
by a fashionable sculptor, with a brush of 
peacock 's feathers. At these things Donald 
looked with a sick sinking at the heart. 
What did it all mean ? How bad was it ? 
And what worse was to come ? 

He waited restlessly for his uncle, who 
came after dinner, and, locking the library 
door, and lighting a cigar, began at once, 
with the manner of a man who has a hard 
job on hand, and means to get it over with. 

Mr. Francis Marcy was a gentlemanly 
man ; polished, cold, calm, hard of face, and 
unmoved in manner. 

" Well, Donald, I have purposely put off 
this interview till the funeral was over. 
It was more decent, for one thing. Then I 
didn't care to worry you, until it became 
necessary. It has now become so. You ob 
serve that there has been no will read. It 
is customary not to read the will till after 
the services."
