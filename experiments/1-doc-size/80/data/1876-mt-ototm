fetch it down again. One day he turned on me 
suddenly with this settler : 

" What is the shape of Walnut Bend ? " 
He might as well have asked me my grand- 
mother's opinion of protoplasm, I reflected respect- 
fully, and then said I didn't know it had any particular shape.
My gunpowdery chief went off with 
a bang, of course, and then went on loading and 
firing until he was out of adjectives. 

I had learned long ago that he only carried just 
so many rounds of ammunition, and was sure to 
subside into a very placable and even remorseful 
old smooth-bore as soon as they were all gone. 
That word " old " is merely affectionate ; he was 
not more than thirty-four. I waited. By and by 
he said, — 

" My boy, you've got to know the shape of the 
river perfectly. It is all there is left to steer by on 
a very dark night. Everything else is blotted out 
and gone. But mind you, it has'nt the same shape 
in the night that it has in the day-time." 

" How on earth am I ever going to learn it, 
then ? " 

" How do you follow a hall at home in the dark ? 
Because you know the shape of it. You can't see 
it." 

" Do you mean to say that I've got to know all 
the million trifling variations of shape in the banks 
of this interminable river as well as I know the 
shape of the front hall at home ? " 

" On my honor you 've got to know them better 
than any man ever did know the shapes of the 
halls in his own house." 

" I wish I was dead ! " 

" Now I don't want to discourage you, but " — 

" Well, pile it on me ; I might as well have it 
DOW as another time." 




" You see, this has got to be learned ; there isn't 
any getting around it. A clear starlight night 
throws such heavy shadows that if you didn't know 
the shape of a shore perfectly you would claw away 
from every bunch of timber, because you would 
take the black shadow of it for a solid cape ; and 
you see you would be getting scared to death every 
fifteen minutes by the watch. You would be fifty 
yards from shore all the time when you ought to be 
within twenty feet of it. You can't see a snag in 
one of those shadows, but you know exactly where 
it is, and the shape of the river tells you when you 
are coming to it. Then there's your pitch dark 
night ; the river is a very different shape on a pitch 
dark night from what it is on a starlight night. All 
shores seem to be straight lines, then, and mighty 
dim ones, too ; and you d run them for straight 
lines, only you know better. You boldly drive your 
boat right into what seems to be a solid, straight 
wall (you knowing very well that in reality there 
is a curve there), and that wall falls back and 
makes way for you. Then there's your grey mist. 
You take a night when there's one of these grisly, 
drizzly, grey mists, and then there isn't any parti- 
cular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle 
the head of the oldest man that ever lived. Well, 
then, different kinds of moonlight change the shape 
of the river in different ways. You see " —
