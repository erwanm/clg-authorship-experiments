Aunt Ruth said, “ Mrs. Morrison has been in this 
alternoon, and she feels quite discouraged, for her 


 


husband had a promise of being employed at the mill 
again, but just now business is dull, and they cannot 
take him until in the fall. If we could do that for 
him I should be very glad. Hugh Morrison has been 
a good son to his poor old mother, who now feels 

herself a sad burden on them in their straitened cir- 

 

cumstances.” 

“ Couldn’t we go and call upon them ? ” asked 
Uncle Eobert. 

“ O yes ” ; and Kathie started up with alacrity. 

“ You will be sure to see Mr. Morrison now,” said 
Aunt Euth. 

So they started, and after a short walk came to 
what was called the tenement-houses, a row of rather 
dilapidated buildings. After being sick half the

“ A man with a family doesn’t have much chance 
to get forehanded,” Mr. Morrison was saying. 
“ Wages are low, and every week lost in the dull 
season counts. Sometimes I ’ve thought of going to 
the West ; but it ’s a hard thing to get started.” 

“ I believe my niece has an offer to make you, 
Mr. Morrison, and it may be as advantageous as 
trying your fortune elsewhere,” Mr. Conover made 
answer. 

“ Oh Uncle Robert, it isn’t really mine. I only 
said — ” and Kathie paused, blushing deeply. 

“ Well, you may say it over again ” ; and he 
smiled, encouragingly. 

“ It ’s to come and live in the gardener’s cottage 
at our new house,” Kathie said, hurriedly, seeing 
that she was expected to speak. 

“ We want a lodge-keeper and gardener, some one
