tion. It quickly proved so great indeed that 
what she was to see further was how he 
turned away before he was attended to, and 
hung off, waiting, smoking, looking about 
the shop; how he went over to Mr. Cocker 's 
own counter and appeared to price things, 
gave in fact presently two or three orders 
and put down money, stood there a long 
time with his back to her, considerately 
abstaining from any glance round to see if 
she were free. It at last came to pass in 
this way that he had remained in the shop 
longer that she had ever yet known him to 
do, and that, nevertheless, when he did turn 
about she could see him time himself she 
was freshly taken up and cross straight to 
her postal subordinate, whom some one 
else had released. He had in his hand all 
this while neither letters nor telegrams, and 
now that he was close to her for she was 
close to the counter-clerk it brought her 
heart into her mouth merely to see him look 
at her neighbor and open his lips. She was 
too nervous to bear it. He asked for a Post- 





office Guide, and the young man whipped out 
a new one; whereupon he said that he 
wished not to purchase, but only to consult 
one a moment; with which, the copy kept 
on loan being produced, he once more wan 
dered off. 

What was he doing to her? What did he 
want of her? Well, it was just the aggra 
vation of his See here! She felt at this 
moment strangely and portentously afraid 
of him had in her ears the hum of a sense 
that, should it come to that kind of tension, 
she must fly on the spot to Chalk Farm. 
Mixed with her dread and with her reflec 
tion was the idea that, if he wanted her so 
much as he seemed to show, it might be 
after all simply to do for him the anything 
she had promised, the everything she had 
thought it so fine to bring out to Mr. Mudge. 
He might want her to help him, might have 
some particular appeal; though, of a truth, 
his manner didn' t denote that denoted on 
the contrary, an embarrassment, an inde 
cision, something of a desire not so much to 

be helped as to be treated rather more nicely 
than she had treated him the other time. 
Yes, he considered quite probably that he 
had help rather to offer than to ask for. 
Still, none the less, when he again saw her 
free he continued to keep away from her, 
when he came back with his Giiide it was 
Mr. Buckton he caught it was from Mr. 
Buckton he obtained half-a-crown 's worth of 
stamps. 

After asking for the stamps he asked, quite 
as a second thought, for a postal-order for 
ten shillings. What did he want with so 
many stamps when he wrote so few letters? 
How could he enclose a postal-order in a 
telegram? She expected him, the next 
thing, to go into the corner and make up 
one of his telegrams half-a-dozen of them 
on purpose to prolong his presence. She 
had so completely stopped looking at him 
that she could only guess his movements 
guess even where his eyes rested. Finally 
she saw him make a dash that might have 
been towards the nook where the forms
