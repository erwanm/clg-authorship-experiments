verdict and no other, and remembered that Joan must fight 
for her good name and her life single-handed against them, 

I asked myself what chance an ignorant poor country girl 
of nineteen could have in such an unequal conflict ; and 
my heart sank down low, very low. When I looked 
again at that obese president, puffing and wheezing there, 
his great belly distending and receding with each breath, 
and noted his three chins, fold above fold, and his knobby 
and knotty face, and his purple and splotchy complexion, 
and his repulsive cauliflower nose, and his cold and malig- 
nant eyes — a brute, every detail of him— my heart sank 
lower still. And when I noted that all were afraid of this 
man, and shrank and fidgeted in their seats when his eye 
smote theirs, my last poor ray of hope dissolved away and 
wholly disappeared. 

There was one unoccupied seat in this place, and only 
one. It was over against the wall, in view of every one. 
It was a little wooden bench without a back, and it stood 
apart and solitary on a sort of dais. Tall men-at-arms 
in morion, breast-plate, and steel gauntlets stood as stiff 
as their own halberds on each side of this dais, but no 
other creature was near by it. A pathetic little bench to 
me it was, for I knew whom it was for ; and the sight of 
it carried my mind back to the great court at Poitiers, 
where Joan sat upon one like it and calmly fought her 
cunning fight with the astonished doctors of the Church 
and Parliament, and rose from it victorious and applauded 
by all, and went forth to fill the world with the glory of 
her name. 

What a dainty little figure she was, and how gentle 
and innocent, how winning and beautiful in the fresh 
bloom of her seventeen years ! Those were grand days. 
And so recent — for she was but just nineteen now — and 
how much she had seen since, and what wonders she 
had accomplished ! 

But now — oh, all was changed now. She had been 
languishing in dungeons, away from light and air and the 
cheer of friendly faces, for nearly three-quarters of a year 
— she, born child of the sun, natural comrade of the birds 


and of all happy free creatures. She would be weary now, 
and worn with this long captivity, her forces impaired ; 
despondent, perhaps, as knowing there was no hope. 
Yes, all was changed. 

All this time there had been a muffled hum of conversa- 
tion, and rustling of robes and scraping of feet on the 
floor, a combination of dull noises which filled all the 
place. Suddenly — 

' Produce the accused ! ' 

It made me catch my breath. My heart began to 
thump like a hammer. But there was silence now — silence 
absolute. All those noises ceased, and it was as if they 
had never been. Not a sound ; the stillness grew oppres- 
sive ; it was like a weight upon one. All faces were 
turned towards the door ; and one could properly expect 
that, for most of the people there suddenly realised, no 
doubt, that they were about to see, in actual flesh and 
blood, what had been to them before only an embodied 
prodigy, a word, a phrase, a world-girdling Name. 

The stillness continued. Then, far down the stone- 
paved corridors, one heard a vague slow sound approach- 
ing : clank clink . . clank — Joan of Arc, 

Deliverer of France, in chains ! 

My head swam ; all things whirled and spun about me. 
Ah, was realising, too.
