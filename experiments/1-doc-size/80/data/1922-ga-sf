Mrs. Ballinger raised her pencilled eyebrows 
and glanced at Maria. Mrs. Abbott gave a 
deep rumbling groan. 

"Poor Howard!" 

"He dreed his weird," said Mrs. McLane 
indifferently. " He couldn't help it. Neither 
could Madeleine." 

"Well, I'd like to hear something more 
about Langdon Masters," announced Guadalupe Bascom. " That is, if you have all satisfied 
your curiosity about Madeleine's clothes. He 
is the one man I never could twist around my 
finger and I've never forgotten him. How 



 

does he look? He certainly should carry some 
stamp of the life he led." 

" Oh, he looks older, of course, and he has 
deeper lines and some gray hairs. But he's 
thin, at least. His figure did not suffer if his 
face did — somewhat. He looks even more 
interesting — at least women would think so. 
You know we good women always have a fatal 
weakness for the man who has lived too much." 

"Speak for yourself, Antoinette." Mrs. 
Ballinger looked like an effigy of virtue in 
silver. "And at your age you should be 
ashamed to utter such a sentiment even if you 
felt it." 

" My hair may be as white as yours," rejoined Mrs. McLane tartly. "But I remain 
a woman, and for that reason attract men to 
this day." 

"Is Masters as brilliant as ever — in conversation, I mean? Is he gay? Lively?" 

" I cannot say that I found him gay, and I 
really saw very little of him except at functions. 
He was very busy. But Mr. McLane was with 
him a good deal, and said that although he was 
rather grim and quiet at times, at others he was 
as brilliant as his letters." 



 

" Does he drink at all, or is he forced to be 
a teetotaller?'' 

"Not a bit of it. He drinks at table as 
others doj no more, no less.'' 

" Then he is cured,'' said Mrs. Bascom contentedly. " Well, I for one am glad that it's all 
right. Still, if he had fallen in love with me 
he would have remained an eminent dtizen — 
without a hideous interval he hardly can care 
to recall — and become the greatest editor in 
California. Have they any social position in 
New York?" 

" Probably. I did not ask. They hardly 
looked like outcasts. You must remember 
their story is wholly unknown in fashionable 
New York. Scarcely any one here knows any 
one in New York Society j or has time for it 
when passing through. . . . But I don't fancy 
they care particularly for Society. In Berlin, 
whenever it was possible, they went off by themselves. But of course it was necessary for both 
to go in Society there, and she must have been 
able to help him a good deal."
