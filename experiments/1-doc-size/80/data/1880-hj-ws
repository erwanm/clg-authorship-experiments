er that while he sipped it Morris reflected that a cel- 
larful of good liquor there was evidently a cellar- 
ful here would be a most attractive idiosyncrasy 
in a father-in-law. The Doctor was struck with his 
appreciative guest ; he saw that he was not a com- 
monplace young man. " He has ability," said Cathe- 
rine's father, " decided ability ; he has a very good 
head if he chooses to use it. And he is uncommon- 
ly well turned out; quite the sort of figure that 
pleases the ladies ; but I don't think I like him." 
The Doctor, however, kept his reflections to himself, 
and talked to his visitors about foreign lands, con- 
cerning which Morris offered him more information 
than he was ready, as he mentally phrased it, to 





swallow. Doctor Sloper had travelled but little, and 
he took the liberty of not believing everything that 
his talkative guest narrated. He prided himself on 
being something of a physiognomist ; and while the 
young man, chatting with easy assurance, puffed his 
cigar and filled his glass again, the Doctor sat with 
his eyes quietly fixed on his bright, expressive face. 
" He has the assurance of the devil himself !" said 
Morris's host ; " I don't think I ever saw such assur- 
ance. And his powers of invention are most re- 
markable. He is very knowing ; they were not so 
knowing as that in my time. And a good head, did 
I say? I should think so after a bottle of Madeira, 
and a bottle and a half of claret !" 

After dinner Morris Townsend went and stood 
before Catherine, who was standing before the fire 
in her red satin gown. 

" He doesn't like me he doesn't like me at all," 
said the young man. 

" Who doesn't like you ?" asked Catherine. 

" Your father ; extraordinary man !" 

" I don't see how you know," said Catherine, 
blushing. 

" I feel ; I am very quick to feel." 

" Perhaps you are mistaken." 

" Ah, well ! you ask him, and you will see." 

" I would rather not ask him, if there is any dan- 
ger of his saying what you think." 

Morris looked at her with an air of mock mel- 
ancholy. 

" It wouldn't give you any pleasure to contradict 
him F 

" I never contradict him," said Catherine. 





" Will you hear me abused without opening your 
lips in my defence ?" 

" My father won't abuse you. He doesn't know 
you enough." 

Morris Townsend gave a loud laugh, and Cathe- 
rine began to blush again. 

" I shall never mention yon," she said, to take 
refuge from her confusion.
