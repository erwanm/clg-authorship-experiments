aware, with a swift possibility of compassion, 
of something that was strangely like a rele- 
gation to obscurity of each of those women 
of taste. It was a stranger operation still that 
her father should on the spot be presented to 
her as quite advantageously and even grandly 
at home in the dazzling scene and himself by 
so much the more separated from scenes in- 
ferior to it. She spent with him in it, while 
explanations continued to hang fire, twenty 
minutes that, in their sudden drop of danger, 
affected her, though there were neither buns 
nor ginger-beer, like an extemporized costly 
treat. 
"Is she very rich?" He had begun to 
strike her as almost embarrassed, so shy that 
he might have found himself with a young 
lady with whom he had little in common. 
She was literally moved by this apprehension 
to offer him some tactful relief. 
Beale Farange stood and smiled at his 
young lady, his back to the fanciful fireplace, 
his light overcoat the very lightest in Lon- 
don wide open and his wonderful lustrous 
beard completely concealing the expanse of 
his shirt-front. It pleased her more than 
ever to think that papa was handsome and, 
though as high aloft as mamma and almost, 
in his specially florid evening dress, as splen- 
did, of a beauty somewhat less belligerent, 
less terrible. "The Countess? Why do you 
ask me that?" 
Maisie's eyes opened wider. " Is she a 
Countess?" 
There was an unaccustomed geniality in 
his enjoyment of her wonder. " Oh, yes, my 
dear but it is n't an English title." 
Maisie's manner appreciated this. " Is it a 
French one? " 
" No, nor French either. It's American." 
Maisie conversed agreeably. "Ah, then, 
of course she is rich." She took in such a 
combination of nationality and rank. " I 
never saw anything so lovely." 
"Did you have a sight of her?" Beale 
asked. 
"At the Exhibition?" Maisie smiled. 
" She was gone too quick." 
Her father laughed. " She did slope ! " 
She was for a moment afraid he would 
say something about Mrs. Beale and Sir 
Claude : his unexpected gentleness was too 
mystifying. All he said was, the next 
minute : " She has a horror of vulgar 
scenes." 
This was something Maisie need n't take 
up; she could still continue bland. "But 
where do you suppose she went? " 
" Oh, I thought she 'd have taken a cab 
and have been here by this time. But she 'll 
turn up all right." 
" I 'm sure I hope she will," Maisie said. 
She spoke with an earnestness begotten of 
the impression of all the beauty around her, 
to which, in person, the Countess might 
make further contributions. "We came 
awfully fast," she added. 
Her father again laughed loud. "Yes, 
my dear I made you step out ! " Beale 
hesitated ; then he added : " I want her to 
see you." Maisie, at this, rejoiced in the at- 
tention that, for their evening out, Mrs. Beale, 
even to the extent of personally " doing up " 
her old hat, had given her appearance. 
Meanwhile her father went on : " You 'll like 
her awfully." 
" Oh, I 'm sure I shall ! " - after which, 
either from the effect of having said so much 
or from that of a sudden glimpse of the im- 
possibility of saying more, she felt a com-
