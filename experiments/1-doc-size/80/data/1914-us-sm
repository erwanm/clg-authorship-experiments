patient with me till I had learned to love him! 
Now I want to burst iuto tears and cry aloud, 
'Oh, why did you do it? Why did I let myself 
be persuaded into this marriage?' 

"I tried to have a talk with him last night, 
after he had decided to go away. I was full of 
pity, and a desire to help. I said I wanted him 
to know that no matter how much we might 
disagree about some things, I meant to learn to 
live happily with him. We must find some sort 
of compromise, for the sake of the child, if not 
for ourselves; we must not let the child suffer. 
He answered coldly that there would be no need 
for the child to suffer, the child would have the 
best the world could afford. I suggested that 
there might arise some question as to just what 
the best was; but to that he said nothing. He 
went on to rebuke my discontent; had he not 
given me everything a woman could want? he 
asked. He was too polite to mention money, 
but he said that I had leisure and entire freedom 
from care. I was persisting in assuming cares, 
while he was doing all in his power to prevent it. 



 

"And that was as far as we got. I gave up the 
discussion, for we should only have gone the old 
round over again. 

" Douglas has taken up a sajdng that my coiisin 
brought with him: 'What you don't know won't 
hurt you!' I think tha»fc before he left, Harley 
had begun to suspect that all was not well between 
my husband and myself, and he felt it necessary 
to give me a little friendly counsel. He was 
tactful, and politely vague, but I imderstood 
him — my worldly-wise yoimg cousin! I think 
that sajong of his sums up the philosophy that 
he would teach to all women — 'What you don't 
know won't hiut you!' " 



 



 

A WEEK or so later Sylvia wrote me that her 
husband was in New York. And I waited another 
week, for good measiu-e, and then one morning 
dropped in for a call upon Claire Lepage. Why 
did I do it? you ask. I had no definite purpose — 
only a general opposition to the philosophy 
of Cousin Harley. 

I was xishered into Claire's boudoir, which was 
still littered with last evening's apparel. She sat 
in a dressing-gown with resplendent red roses on 
it, and brushed the hair out of her eyes, and 
apologized for not being ready for callers. 

"I've just had a talking to from Larry," she 
explained. 

"Larry?" said I, inquiriily; for Claire had 
always informed me elaborately that van Tuiver 
had been her one departure from propriety, and 
always would be. 

Apparently she had now reached a stage in her 
career where pretenses were too much trouble. 
"I've come to the conclusion that I don't know 
how to manage men," she said. "I never can 
get along with one for any time."
