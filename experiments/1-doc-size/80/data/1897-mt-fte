Then, of course, they wanted to know all about the trip ; 
and he said — 

" Come right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks — 
it's my treat. I'm going to tell you all about it. And to-night 
it's my treat again — and we'll have oysters and a time ! " 

When the drinks were brought and cigars lighted, Ed said — 

" Well, when I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt — " 

" Great Scott ! " 

" Gracious, how you scared me. What's the matter ? " 

"Oh — er — 'nothing. Nothing — it was a tack in the 
hair-seat," said one. 

"But you aZZ said it. However, no matter. When I delivered
the letter — " 



" Did you deliver it ? " And they looked at each other as 
people might who thought that maybe they were dreaming. 

Then they settled to listening ; and as the story deepened 
and its marvels grew, the amazement of it made them dumb, 
and the interest of it took their breath. They hardly uttered 
a whisper during two hours, but sat like petrifactions and 
drank in the immortal romance. At last the tale was ended, 
and Ed said — 

" And it's all owing to you boys, and you'll never find rne 
ungrateful — bless your hearts, the best friends a fellow "fever 
had ! You'll all have places ; I want every one of you. I 
Icnow you — I know you ' by the hack as the gamblers say. 
You're jokers, and all that, but you're sterling with the hall- 
mark on. And Charley Fairchild, you shall be my first assist- 
ant and right hand, because of your first-class ability, and be- 
cause you got me the letter, and for your father's sake who 
wrote it for me, and to please Mr. Vanderbilt, who said it 
would ! And here's to that great man — drink hearty ! " 

Yes, when the Moment comes, the Man appears — even if 
he is a thousand miles away, and has to be discovered by a 
practical joke. 





CHAPTER XXIX. 

When people do not respect us we are sharply offended ; j'et deep down in his 
private heart no man much respects himself. — Puddnhead Wilso7i''s New Calendar. 

NECESSARILY, the human interest is the first interest 
in the log-book of any country. The annals of Tas- 
mania, in whose shadow we were sailing, are lurid 
with that feature. Tasmania was a convict-dump, in old 
times ; this has been indicated in the account of the Concil-" 
iator, where reference is made to vain attempts of desperate 
convicts to win to permanent freedom, after escaping from 
Macquarrie Harbor and the "Gates of Hell." In the early 
days Tasmania had a great population of convicts, of both 
sexes and all ages, and a bitter hard life they had. In one spot 
there was a settlement of juvenile convicts — children — who 
had been sent thither from their home and their friends on 
the other side of the globe to expiate their " crimes." 

In due course our ship entered the estuary called the Der- 
went, at whose head stands Hobart, the capital of Tasmania. 
The Derwent's shores furnish scenery of an interesting sort. 
The historian Laurie, whose book, " The Story of Australasia," 
is just out, invoices its features with considerable truth and in- 
temperance : " The marvelous picturesqueness of every point 
of view, combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and the 
transparency of the ocean depths, must have delighted and
