reporters present. There'll probably be a brief announcement among the
cases in court; but there won't be anything painful. You needn't be
afraid. But what I'm anxious about now is, not to bring any influence to
bear on you. I promised my wife I wouldn't urge you, and I won't; I know
I'm a little optimistic, and if you don't see this thing exactly
couleur de rose, don't you do it from anything I say." Pinney
apparently put great stress upon himself to get this out.
"I've looked it in the face," said Northwick.
"And your friends know you're coming back?"
"They expect me at any time. You can notify them."
Pinney drew a long, anxious breath. "Well," he said, with a sort of
desperation, "then I don't see why we don't start at once."
"Have you got your papers all right?" Northwick asked.
"Yes," said Pinney, with a blush. "But you know," he added,
respectfully, "I can't touch you till we get over the line, Mr.
Northwick."
"I understand that. Let me see your warrant."
Pinney reluctantly produced the paper, and Northwick read it carefully
over. He folded it up with a deep sigh, and took a long stiff envelope
from his breast-pocket, and handed it to Pinney, with the warrant. "Here
is the money I brought with me."
"Mr. Northwick! It isn't necessary yet! Indeed it isn't. I've every
confidence in your honor as a gentleman." Pinney's eyes glowed with joy,
and his fingers closed upon the envelope convulsively. "But if you mean
business--"
"I mean business," said Northwick. "Count it."
Pinney took the notes out and ran them over. "Forty-one thousand six
hundred and forty."
"That is right," said Northwick. "Now, another matter. Have you got
handcuffs?"
"Why, Mr. Northwick! What are you giving me?" demanded Pinney. "I'd as
soon put them on my own father."
"I want you to put them on me," said Northwick. "I intend to go back
as your prisoner. If I have anything to expiate"--and he seemed to
indulge a question of the fact for the last time--"I want the atonement
to begin as soon as possible. If you haven't brought those things with
you, you'd better go out to the police station and get them, while I
attend to the tickets."
"Oh, I needn't go," said Pinney, and his face burned.
He was full of nervous trepidation at the start, and throughout the
journey he was anxious and perturbed, while on Northwick, after the
first excitement, a deep quiet, a stupor, or a spiritual peace, seemed
to have fallen.
"By George!" said Pinney, when they started, "anybody to see us would
think you were taking me back." He was tenderly watchful of
Northwick's comfort; he left him free to come and go at the stations;
from the restaurants he bought him things to tempt his appetite; but
Northwick said he did not care to eat.
They had a long night in a day-car, for they found there was no sleeper
on their train. In the morning, when the day broke, Northwick asked
Pinney what the next station was.
Pinney said he did not know. He looked at Northwick as if the possession
of him gave him very little pleasure, and asked him how he had slept.
"I haven't slept," said Northwick. "I suppose I'm rather excited. My
nerves seem disordered."
"Well, of course," said Pinney, soothingly.
They were silent a moment, and then Northwick asked, "What did you say
the next station was?"
"I'll ask the brakeman." They could see the brakeman on the platform.
Pinney went out to him, and returned. "It's Wellwater, he says. We get
breakfast there."
"Then we're over the line, now," said Northwick.
"Why, yes," Pinney admitted, reluctantly. He added, in a livelier note,
"You get a mighty good breakfast at Wellwater, and I'm ready to meet it
half way." He turned, and looked hard at Northwick. "If I should happen
to get left there, what would you do? Would you keep on, anyway? Is your
mind still made up on that point? I ask, because all kinds of accidents
happen, and--" Pinney stopped, and regarded his captive fixedly. "Or if
you don't feel quite able to travel--"
"Let me see your warrant again," said Northwick.
Pinney relaxed his gaze with a shrug, and produced the paper. Northwick
read it all once more. "I'm your prisoner," he said, returning the
paper. "You can put the handcuffs on me now."
"No, no, Mr. Northwick!" Pinney pleaded. "I don't want to do that. I'm
not afraid of your trying to get away. I assure you it isn't necessary
between gentlemen."
Northwick held out his wrists. "Put them on, please."
"Oh, well, if I must!" protested Pinney. "But I swear I won't lock
'em." He glanced round to find whether any of the other passengers were
noticing. "You can slip 'em off whenever you get tired of 'em." He
