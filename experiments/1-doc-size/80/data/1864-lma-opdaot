hide some quiver of emotion at the thought of such a sudden
sundering of all the dear home-ties.

These things had happened two days before; now John was dying, and
the letter had not come. I had been summoned to many death-beds in
my life, but to none that made my heart ache as it did then, since
my mother called me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this
in its gentleness and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched
out both hands,--

“I knew you’d come! I guess I’m moving on, ma’am.”

He was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his face I
saw the gray veil falling that no human hand can lift. I sat down by
him, wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred the air about him
with the slow wave of a fan, and waited to help him die. He stood in
sore need of help,--and I could do so little; for, as the doctor had
foretold, the strong body rebelled against death, and fought every
inch of the way, forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and
clench his hands with an imploring look, as if he asked, “How long
must I endure this, and be still?” For hours he suffered dumbly,
without a moment’s respite, or a moment’s murmuring; his limbs grew
cold, his face damp, his lips white, and, again and again, he tore
the covering off his breast, as if the lightest weight added to his
agony; yet through it all, his eyes never lost their perfect
serenity, and the man’s soul seemed to sit therein, undaunted by the
ills that vexed his flesh.

One by one the men woke, and round the room appeared a circle of
pale faces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity; for, though a
stranger, John was beloved by all. Each man there had wondered at
his patience, respected his piety, admired his fortitude, and now
lamented his hard death; for the influence of an upright nature had
made itself deeply felt, even in one little week. Presently, the
Jonathan who so loved this comely David came creeping from his bed
for a last look and word. The kind soul was full of trouble, as the
choke in his voice, the grasp of his hand betrayed; but there were
no tears, and the farewell of the friends was the more touching for
its brevity.

“Old boy, how are you?” faltered the one.

“Most through, thank heaven!” whispered the other.

“Can I say or do anything for you anywheres?”

“Take my things home, and tell them that I did my best.”

“I will! I will!”

“Good-by, Ned.”

“Good-by, John, good-by!”

They kissed each other, tenderly as women, and so parted; for poor
Ned could not stay to see his comrade die. For a little while, there
was no sound in the room but the drip of water from a stump or two,
and John’s distressful gasps, as he slowly breathed his life away. I
thought him nearly gone, and had just laid down the fan, believing
its help to be no longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his
bed, and cried out with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply
startling every one with its agonized appeal,--

“For God’s sake, give me air!”

It was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him, the only boon
he had asked; and none of us could grant it, for all the airs that
blew were useless now. Dan flung up the window. The first red streak
of dawn was warming the gray east, a herald of the coming sun. John
saw it, and with the love of light which lingers in us to the end,
seemed to read in it a sign of hope of help, for, over his whole
face there broke that mysterious expression, brighter than any
smile, which often comes to eyes that look their last. He laid
himself gently down; and, stretching out his strong right arm, as if
to grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow,
lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, which assured us that for
him suffering was forever past. He died then; for, though the heavy
breaths still tore their way up for a little longer, they were but
the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt against the wreck,
which an immortal voyager had deserted with a smile. He never spoke
