the beginning of anything like genuine work 
for me. Mr. Alden tells me that it was published 
in January, 1864; but I think it must 
have been written a while before that, though 
not long, for its appearance quickly followed 
the receipt of the manuscript. The name of 
the story was "A Sacrifice Consumed." It 
was a very little story, not covering more than 
four or five pages in print. I sent it to " 
Harper's Magazine," without introduction or what 
young writers are accustomed to call " influence ;
" it was sent quite privately, without the 
knowledge of any friend. It was immediately 
accepted, and a prompt check for twenty-five 
dollars accompanied the acceptance. Even my 
father knew nothing of the venture until I car 
ried the letter and enclosure to him. The
pleasure on his expressive face was only equaled by 
its frank and unqualified astonishment. He 
read the story when it came out, and, I think, 
was touched by it, it was a story of a poor 
and plain little dressmaker, who lost her lover in 
the army, and his genuine emotion gave me 
a kind of awed elation, which has never been 
repeated in my experience. Ten hundred thou 
sand unknown voices could not move me to 
the pride and pleasure which my father's first 
gentle word of approval gave to a girl who 
cared much to be loved and little to be praised ; 
and the plaudits of a " career " were the last 
things in earth or heaven then occupying her 
mind. 

Afterwards, I wrote with a distinct purpose, 
and, I think, quite steadily. I know that longer 
stories went, soon and often, to the old magazine, 
which never sent them back ; and to which 
I am glad to pay the tribute of a gratitude that 
I have never outgrown. There was nothing of 


the stuff that heroines and geniuses are made 
of in a shy and self-distrustful girl, who had no 
faith in her own capabilities, and, indeed, at 
that time the smallest possible amount of 
interest in the subject. 

It may be a humiliating fact, but it is the 
truth, that had my first story been refused, or 
even the second or the third, I should have 
written no more. 

For the opinion of important editors, and for 
the sacredness of market value in literary wares, 
as well as in professorships or cotton cloth, I 
had a kind of respect at which I sometimes 
wonder ; for I do not recall that it was ever 
distinctly taught me. But, assuredly, if nobody 
had cared for my stories enough to print them, 
I should have been the last person to differ 
from the ruling opinion, and should have bought 
at Warren Draper's old Andover book-store no 
more cheap printer's paper on which to inscribe 
the girlish handwriting (with the pointed letters 
and the big capitals) which my father, with 
patient pains, had caused to be taught me by a 
queer old traveling master with an idea. 
Professor Phelps, by the way, had an exquisite 
chirography, which none of his children, to his 
evident disappointment, inherited. 

But the editor of " Harper's " took every 
thing I sent him ; so the pointed letters and 
 

the large capitals continued to flow towards his 
desk. 

Long after I had achieved whatever success 
has been given me, this magazine returned me
