* Dr. Rosalie Morton, the leading woman doctor and surgeon of New 
York, who also studied this subject at first hand, agrees with me that 
the war tasks have improved the health of the European women. 



 

romped and enjoyed the old life in the old fashion 
when off duty) that with the inferior task they have 
become the inferior sex again. The wife, to be sure, 
will feel something more than her husband's equal, 
and the Frenchwoman never has felt herself the inferior in the matrimonial partnership. But how about 
the wage earners? Those that made ten to fifteen 
francs a day in the Usines de Guerre, and will now 
be making four or five? How about the girls who 
cannot marry because their families are no longer in 
a position to pay the dot, without which no French 
girl dreams of marrying? These girls not only have 
been extraordinarily (for Frenchwomen of their class) 
affluent during the long period of the war, but they 
order men about, and they are further upheld with 
the thought that they are helping their beloved France 
to conquer the enemy. They live on another plane, 
and life is apt to seem very mean and commonplace 
under the old conditions. 

, That these women are not masculinized is proved 
by the fact that many have borne children during the 
second year of the war, their tasks being made lighter 
until they are restored to full strength again. They 
invariably return as soon as possible, however. It 
may be, of course, that the young men and women of 
the lower bourgeoisie will forswear the dot, for it 
would be but one more old custom giving way to 
necessity. In that case the sincere, hardworking and 
not very humorous women of this class no doubt would 
find full compensation in the home, and promptly do 



 

her duty by the State. But I doubt if any other alternative will console any but the poorest intelligence or 
the naturally indolent â€” and perhaps Frenchwomen, 
unless good old-fashioned butterflies, have less laziness in their make-up than any other women under 
the sun. 

The natural volatility of the race must also be taken 
into consideration. Stoical in their substratum, bubbling on the surface, it may be that these women who 
took up the burdens of men so bravely will shrug their 
shoulders and revert to pure femininity. Those past 
the age of allurement may fight like termagants for 
their lucrative jobs, their utter independence; but coquetry and the joy in life, or, to put it more plainly, 
the powerful passions of the French race, may do 
more to effect an automatic and permanent return to 
the old status than any authoritative act on the part 
of man. 



The women of England are (or were) far more 
neurotic than the women of France, as they have 
fewer natural outlets. And the struggle' for legal enfranchisement, involving, as it did, a sensationalism 
that affected even the non-combatants, did much to 
enhance this tendency, and it is interesting to speculate whether this war will make or finish them. Once 
more, personally, I believe it will make them, but as 
I was not able to go to London after my investigations in France were concluded and observe for myself 



 

I refuse to indulge in speculations. Time will show, 
and before very long. 

No doubt, however, when the greater question of 
winning the war is settled, the question of sex equality 
will rage with a new violence, perhaps in some new 
form, among such bodies of women as are not so
