victoria her own, and the easy indifference of Mrs. 
Westangle as to how they should get to her house. If 
he had been alone he might have felt the indifference 
as a slight, but as it was he felt it rather a favor. If 
Miss Shirley was feeling it a slight, she was too secret 
or too sweet to let it be known, and he thought that was 
nice of her. Still, he believed he might recognize the 
fact without deepening a possible hurt of hers, and he 
added, with no apparent relevance, " If Mrs. Westangle 
was not looking for us on this train, she will find that 
it is the unexpected which happens." 

" We are certainly going to happen," the girl said, 
with an acceptance of the plural which deepened the 
intimacy of the situation, and which was not displeasing 
to Verrian when she added, " If our friend's vehicle 
holds out." Then she turned her face full upon him, 
with what affected him as austere resolution, in con- 
tinuing, " But I can't let you suppose that you're con- 
veying a society person, or something of that sort, to 
Mrs. Westangle's." His own face expressed his mystifi- 

 

cation, and she concluded, " I'm simply going there to 
begin my work." 

He smiled provisionally in temporizing with the rid- 
dle. " You women are wonderful, nowadays, for the 
work you do." 

" Oh, but," she protested, nervously, anxiously, " it 
isn't good work that I'm going to do — I understand 
what you mean — it's work for a living. I've no busi- 
ness to be arriving with an invited guest, but it seemed 
to be a question of arriving or not at the time when I 
was due."

Verbian stared at her now from a visage that was an 
entire blank, though behind it conjecture was busy, and 
he was asking himself whether his companion was some 
new kind of hair - dresser, or uncommonly cultivated 
manicure, or a nursery governess obeying a hurry call to 
take a place in Mrs. Westangle's household, or some sort 
of amateur housekeeper arriving to supplant a profes- 
sional. But he said nothing. 

Miss Shirley said, with a distress which was genuine, 
though he perceived a trace of amusement in it, too, 
" I see that I will have to go on." 

" Oh, do !" he made out to utter. 

" I am going to Mrs. Westangle's as a sort of mistress 
of the revels. The business is so new that it hasn't 
got its name yet, but if I fail it won't need any. I 
invented it on a hint I got from a girl who undertakes 
the floral decorations for parties. I didn't see why 
some one shouldn't furnish suggestions for amusements, 
as well as flowers. I was always rather lucky at that 
in my own f am — at my father's — " She pulled herself 
sharply up, as if danger lay that way. " I got an 
introduction to Mrs. Westangle, and she's to let me try. 
I am going to her simply as part of the catering, and 
I'm not to have any recognition in the hospitalities. So 
it wasn't necessary for her to send for me at the station, 
except as a means of having me on the ground in good 
season. I have to thank you for that, and — I thank 
you." She ended in a sigh. 

 

" It's very interesting," Verrian said, and he hoped 
he was not saying it in any ignoble way. 

He was very presently to learn. Bound a turn of the
