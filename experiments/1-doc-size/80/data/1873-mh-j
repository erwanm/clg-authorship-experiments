so carefully waited upon from my cradle up to the present hour,
when my darling husband will hardly let me put my foot to the ground
without his assistance. You can't imagine how aux petits soins he
is in the retirement of our sweet, sweet home! True, the house is
large, preposterously large--as I told my dear, indulgent father
when he bought it. And as Orrin is fond of style, and I have always
been used to it, we keep up a ridiculous establishment when one
considers the size of the family. Now, I dare say, you keep but two
or three women-servants, and maybe no man at all, as you have no
carriage of your own?"

"Phoebe is our only servant," said Jessie, unperturbed at having
to state the mortifying fact with which Mrs. Wyllys was already
acquainted.

"Is it possible!" looking curiously about her through her gold
eye-glass. "Yet everything about your little place is as neat as a
pin. What a valuable creature she must be! I declare I must tell
Orrin that! 'Five servants to wait upon two people, my love!' I said
to him this very evening. 'It is frightful extravagance!' But he
insists that I shall be relieved from all drudgery, knowing how
delicately I have been reared. If I were fond of work, I should be
puzzled how to employ myself at the hours when there are no
visitors. When I am ennuyée in Orrin's absence, I have only to run
across the street to my uncle's, Judge Provost's, to find plenty of
society. What a houseful of children they have! I told Orrin
yesterday, that it was lucky he never fancied Jeannie Provost (who,
to whisper a secret, was just perfectly crazy after him!) My uncle
has a large fortune, but it will be cut up by the rule of long
division at his death. How fast you sew! Your protégées are some of
your Dundee parishioners, I suppose?" condescendingly to the woman
of low estate.

"No. The few poor there are so well cared for by their neighbors as
not to require my help. This is work allotted me by the Managers of
the Hamilton Charitable Society. There is much suffering here this
winter."

"Ah!" indifferently. "Orrin doesn't approve of my attending these
Women's Societies. He says it would unsex me--that he so admires my
thorough womanliness! And, after all, when people can give money to
the collectors and visitors and agents, and all that kind of
nuisance, there is no use in doing anything else. The demands upon
us in the name of charity, are just perfectly awful! I said to
Orrin--dear, generous soul! this very morning--'My sweet love, you
must positively bear in mind that we are not quite made of
money!'"

A photograph upon a handsome easel attracted her attention, and the
eye-glass was on duty.

"Is that a fancy picture, or a portrait?"

"It is a likeness of my sister."

"Indeed! Is she single or married? What is her name?"

"Her name is Eunice Kirke."

"Ah! a spinster! She is a very nice-looking person! As you were
saying, the winter is severe! But the skating and sleighing are
superb! I was on the ice several times last week with Orrin. He's
such a splendid skater: I am so proud to be seen with him! I
suppose you must have heard how much attention we attract whenever
we appear?"

"I see very little of general society, this winter," Jessie politely
evaded the inquiry. "I am not in the way of hearing about gay
assemblies of any kind."

"Oh, yes! I forgot you were wearing black. But you shouldn't bury
yourself too much, even to keep your house in this lovely order. I
have seen you out driving several times with Mrs. Baxter, and said
to Orrin what a convenience you must find her carriage. And while I
think of it, do let me call by for you some day in the sleigh! Orrin
and I have spoken of doing it, scores of times, but to confess the
truth, we are just a little selfish! We so enjoy riding
together, that we neglect our friends. Before I married Orrin, some
officious friends advised me not to expect much attention from him
after the wedding, 'because he was a ladies' man.' Such were
