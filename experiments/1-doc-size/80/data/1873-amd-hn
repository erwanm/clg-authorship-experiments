CHAPTER XXV. 

CLEMENT. 

" A LETTEB from Clement ; " and Philip held it up in 
triumph. " It is to mother, or I should have broken tne 
seal. I am all impatience to know if it announces hia 
return." 

They were gathered on the wide porch in the summer 
afternoon. The lawn spreading out before them was a 
mass of greenness and bloom, and wafts of honeysuckle 
and jasmine were blown about by the soft south wind. 

Philip tossed the letter into his mother's lap, and fold- 
ing his arms, leaned against the vine-bound column. 

" He is coming will follow the letter speedily, he says, 
but not alone. He was married on the morning this letter 
was written." 

Half a dozen wondering, eager faces turned towards her 
in surprise. 

" I shall bring no stranger into the home circle, but one 
whom you have seen, and whom you must love for her 
own sake as well as mine ; for her pure, noble soul, and 
unswerving truth. I know you will be surprised, yet I 
believe the love is only a more comprehensive outgrowth 
of my boyish fancy." 

Mrs. Ashburton read that sentence aloud, pausing amid 
the various ejaculations. 

"Doesn't he mention any name ? " asked Philip. 

"No. We may expect him in about ten days after the 
receipt of this." 

"How odd and mysterious for straightforward Clement 
Nelly, you know the most about his friends can yon 
venture a guess ? " 



 

"I should have to consider. It is very strange, I think." 

"He admits that it is a sudden resolve, but circum- 
stances rendered it necessary, and will justify him to us. 
he believes," continued Mrs. Asbburton. 

They were all silent, feeling that they would rather have 
welcomed him alone after this seven years' absence. There 
would be so much to say that no stranger could know of 
appreciate. Consequently they were hardly as joyful as 
they expected to be. 

Madge was the first to recover. 

" Clement has been very good and generous to us," she 
said, "and after this seven years of toil and exile, he 
deserves to be happy. We will not question, because he 
has chosen it in his own way, neither should our welcome 
be less warm." 

The sweet and heartsome voice seemed to restore their 
wonted interest. Clement was a noble and tender brother, 
and they could trust him to choose wisely, or at least to 
be loyal to-the old home ties. 

But for the next ten days there was a great deal of 
Hpeculation, and each tried hard to hope for the pleasant- 
est of reunions. Eleanor, with her peculiar and painful 
experience, felt most anxious. For now they had all 
become so united that they dreaded any break. And she 
knew' only too well the difference one inharmonious soul 
might make.
