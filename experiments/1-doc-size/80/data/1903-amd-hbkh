 


She could hardly get asleep for think- 
ing of it. She would have the Lewis 
girls over one afternoon, and they would 
have such fun! If she only dared ask 
Carrie Lanham, who was so very funny, 
hut her mother had refused her permis- 
sion to go to Carrie’s house, and had 
said that she did not approve of such a 
companion. But Bessie went to school 
with her, and if she was good enough 
to go to school, and to Sunday-school, 
why— she couldn’t he so very bad. And 
not to have to sew any, and to do the 
work when she liked— oh, it would be just 
splendid ! 

So the next morning Mrs. Collins 
kissed her and said good-by, taking Lotty, 
the baby, with her, to make a short visit 
to the next town where Grandmother 
Collins was ill. 


 


The train went at nine. Mrs. Collins

for washing then. There were the 
breakfast knives to scour, the place to 


sweep up, beans to shell for dinner, and 
three hours to do it in. 

She stood in the doorway for several 
moments, looking out over the distant 
fields. 

don’t believe I will scour the knives 
this morning, ’ ’ she said, presently. 

We will only need three more at dinner, 
and I can do it all then under the one 
fuss. And I’ll just brush up the kitchen. 
I shall have to give it a good sweeping 
after dinner. Eleven will be early 
enough to begin at the beans. If I kept 
house I should not work every moment 
of the time, I know. When I am mar-

Bessie fell into a brown study there, 
and out of the chaos of thought came
