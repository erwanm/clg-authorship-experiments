"Don't be a fool!" advised Mrs. Minor, in a short, incisive tone.

She, like most other people, had meant to economize this summer; but now
she made a sudden start for Newport. Irene certainly was peerless in her
half-mourning, with her statuesque figure. But there was not an eligible
at Newport, so they turned their steps Saratoga-ward. And here they
found an old admirer of Mrs. Minor's, Gordon Barringer, a widower for
the second time, the owner of a silver-mine and a railroad, and Heaven
alone knew the length and breadth of his possessions.

Miss Agatha Lawrence had turned up her aristocratic nose at him, as a
rather coarse and self-assured person, as proud of his want of education
as other men were of its acquirement. Now he was about forty, stout,
high-colored, loud of voice, and with an important swagger. But money
had given "our enterprising citizen" power, and he both understood and
wielded it skilfully.

His wife had been dead barely six months, but when he met Irene Lawrence
he decided at once that the penniless beauty would be only too glad to
marry him. He was proud to think he could afford to be so magnanimous.
Mrs. Minor settled herself to the fact that there must be no foolish
dallying. Of course Irene would see. She could not be so idiotically,
so fatally blind!

I do not know that at this period of her life Irene Lawrence had any
ideal. She had made conquests so easily, she had found men so much
alike, and in her secret heart she despised them for being so ready to
kneel and bow at beauty's shrine. It seemed to her as if youth and
fortune were alike boundless; and she literally took no thought for the
morrow, until the tidings of her father's death was followed by the
subsequent news of loss of fortune.

If George Eastman had a self-conviction that he and his cousin had
contributed to this downfall, he tried to make it up to Irene in
brotherly kindness and generous expenditure where money was concerned.
He solaced himself with the thought that, after all, he had no more than
his own, or what should have been his own rightfully, though he fancied
he could not have gone on to the end quite as Horace had.

When Sir Christopher Frodsham came across the two ladies in Paris,
Gertrude exulted at the easy conquest. A man of fifty, whose young years
and health had been spent in sowing a plentiful crop of wild oats, but
to whom had come now, quite unexpectedly, a fortune and a title; and
prosperity, after years of rather bitter economy, made him miserly, as
it not unfrequently does such men. That he would have been glad to marry
this young, beautiful girl, for himself alone, was most true. And Irene,
in the bewilderment of the losses, inclined to his proposal, and begged
time for consideration.

He was not a man she could admire, respect, or love. He was narrow,
egotistical, selfish, and with the pitiful vanity of a worn-out rou√©.
Frodsham Park was in a lonely, mountainous part of England, bordering on
Wales; and this man would look upon his wife as a nurse and companion,
and the mother of an heir.

There must have been a little strain of heroism in the girl. Suddenly,
in one of those quick, vivid flashes, like mental lightning, she saw
that she could not do this thing. She was not at all given to analysis;
she had never dissected her own soul, or that of her neighbors; but she
arrived at one of those swift, clear verdicts,--she could not marry Sir
Christopher; and she told him so, with a frankness a trifle tenderer,
perhaps, than she had used with her lovers heretofore, as if some way
she had wronged him in thought.

Over this, as I said, she and Gertrude had bitter words and a parting.
Now the same thing stared her in the face again. This lover was too
obtuse to be stung by the fine arts of coquetry that lengthened practice
had brought to perfection. In all the bravery of self-assertion, he did
not know when he was beaten; and so he fought against the intangible
spear-points with which Miss Lawrence could surround herself.

Mr. Barringer was called to New York on important business law-suits;
and two days after, Mrs. Minor declared herself wearied out with
Saratoga. Irene felt the walls of fate closing remorselessly about her.
Why should she struggle? she asked herself. After all, what could she do
but marry?

Meanwhile, Hope Mills had been sold. Fred made some inquiries about it.
