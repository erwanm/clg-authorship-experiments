has its own ways.”

Phil knew very little of Ireland, and did not fully understand Mrs.
McGuire’s philosophical remarks. Otherwise they might have amused him,
as they may possibly amuse my readers.

I cannot undertake to chronicle the conversation that took place between
Phil and his hostess. She made numerous inquiries, to some of which he
was able to give satisfactory replies, to others not. But in half
an hour there was an interruption, and a noisy one. Three stout,
freckled-faced children ran in at the back door, dripping as if they had
just emerged from a shower-bath. Phil moved aside to let them approach
the stove.

Forthwith Mrs. McGuire was engaged in motherly care, removing a part
of the wet clothing, and lamenting for the state in which her sturdy
offspring had returned. But presently order was restored, and the bustle
was succeeded by quiet.

“Play us a tune,” said Pat, the oldest.

Phil complied with the request, and played tune after tune, to the great
delight of the children, as well as of Mrs. McGuire herself. The result
was that when, shortly after, on the storm subsiding, Phil proposed
to go, the children clamored to have him stay, and he received such
a cordial invitation to stop till the next morning that he accepted,
nothing loath. So till the next morning our young hero is provided for.



CHAPTER XXIII

A PITCHED BATTLE

Has my youthful reader ever seen a dog slinking home with downcast
look and tall between his legs? It was with very much the same air
that Pietro in the evening entered the presence of the padrone. He had
received a mortifying defeat, and now he had before him the difficult
task of acknowledging it.

“Well, Pietro,” said the padrone, harshly, “where is Filippo?”

“He is not with me,” answered Pietro, in an embarrassed manner.

“Didn’t you see him then?” demanded his uncle, hastily.

For an instant Pietro was inclined to reply in the negative, knowing
that the censure he would incur would be less. But Phil might yet be
taken--he probably would be, sooner or later, Pietro thought--and then
his falsehood would be found out, and he would in consequence lose the
confidence of the padrone. So, difficult though it was, he thought it
politic to tell the truth.

“Si, signore, I saw him,” said he.

“Then why didn’t you drag him home?” demanded his uncle, with contracted
brow. “Didn’t I tell you to bring him home?”

“Si, signore, but I could not.”

“Are you not so strong as he, then?” asked the padrone, with a sneer.
“Is a boy of twelve more than a match for you, who are six years older?”

“I could kill him with my little finger,” said Pietro, stung by this
taunt, and for the moment he looked as if he would like to do it.

“Then you didn’t want to bring him? Come, you are not too old for the
stick yet.”

Pietro glowed beneath his dark skin with anger and shame when these
words were addressed to him. He would not have cared so much had they
been alone, but some of the younger boys were present, and it shamed him
to be threatened in their presence.

“I will tell you how it happened,” he said, suppressing his anger as
well as he could, “and you will see that I was not in fault.”

“Speak on, then,” said his uncle; but his tone was cold and incredulous.

Pietro told the story, as we know it. It will not be necessary to repeat
