looking at me, but at the dead branches, ' You 
might call it the Margaret Fund.' " 

"That was the name of his first wife!" Edith 
exclaimed. 

" Yes, I remember. I said I would, and began to 
thank him again as I rose from my chair. He was 
still looking away, and saying, as if to himself, ' I 
think she would like that.' And then he turned, 
and, in his usual abrupt office manner, said : ' Good- 
morning, good-morning. I am very much obliged 
to you.' " 





" "Wasn't it all very strange !" Edith spoke, after 
a moment. " I didn't suppose he cared. Do you 
think it was just sentiment ?" 

" I shouldn't wonder. Men like Henderson do 
queer things. In the hearts of such hardened men 
there are sometimes roots of sentiment that you 
wouldn't suspect. But I don't know. The Lord 
somehow looks out for his poor." 

Notwithstanding this windfall of charity, Father 
Damon seemed somewhat depressed. "I wish," 
he sa"id, after a pause, " he had given it to the mis- 
sion. ATe are so poor, and modern philanthropy 
all runs in other directions. The relief of tempo- 
rary suffering has taken the place of the care of 
souls." 

"But Dr. Leigh said that you were interesting 
the churches in the labor unions." 

"Yes. It is an effort to do something. The 
church must put herself into sympathetic relations 
with these people, or she will accomplish nothing. 
To get them into the church we must take up their 
burdens. But it is a long way round. It is not 
the old method of applying the gospel to men's 
sins." 

"And yet," Edith insisted, "you must admit 
that such people as Dr. Leigh are doing a good 
work." 

Father Damon did not reply immediately. Pres- 
ently he asked : " Do you think, Mrs. Delancj^, that 







Dr. Leigh has any sympathy with the higher life, 
with spiritual things ? I wish I could think so." 
" With the higher life of humanity, certainly." 
" Ah, that is too vague. I sometimes feel that 
she and those like her are the worst opponents to 
our work. They substitute humanitarianism for 
the gospel." 

" Yet I know of no one who works more than 
Ruth Leigh in the self-sacrificing spirit of the 
Master." 

" "Whom she denies !" The quick reply came 
with a flush in his pale face, and he instantly arose 
and walked away to the window and stood for 
some moments in silence. When he turned there 
was another expression in his eyes and a note of 
tenderness in his voice that contradicted the se- 
verity of the priest. It was the man that spoke. 
" Yes, she is the best woman I ever knew. God
