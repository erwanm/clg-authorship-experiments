did not like him to look at me in that eager, absorbed 
way ; ’ ’ and she flushes burningly at the remembrance of 
it. “He came in to say good-by. And oh! he wasn’t 
wicked : he even feels that it is best never to see me 
again ; but it is impossible for him to forget. He has 
prayed : will not God help him sometime ? And it must 
be so awful to feel that your whole life is wrong, that, try 
as you may, you cannot get into any harmonious accord. 
He has his education and ordination ; and he does, in a 
confused, blundering way, the work that is set before him, 
or that he flnds to do. I do believe he prays and tries 
more than many another minister ; yet the real grace is 
forever wanting, though he seems to have a true and 
tender sense of religion itself. What can be done? ” 

“ You cannot advise, Theo.” 

“ Oh, no, no! I should be afraid. Yet I should say, 
if it was my right, ‘ Give up preaching. Teach, work, 
flud the place where you may feel at home, without all thi s 





stri'\"ing, and restless dissatisfaction. Try to love your 
wife.’ Oh! that is absurd; ” and the tears flood Theo’s 
ej’es again. “I never could love Alfred: so it is quite 
possible that he may never be able to love her in the high 
and holy sense, though he will always be kind to her. 
But oh, I wish he had not told me! ” she moans dis- 
tressfully. 

“ It was weak, unmanly in him,” I cry sharply, think- 
ing of another, who would thrust his right hand into the 
flames rather than do such a thing. 

“ Chrissie, what is there about me, — what charm, that 
Mr. Ross should be willing to sin, that Alfred should not 
be able to forget? I know now that I did not love Mr. 
Ross, for all my trying. I never made any great pretence ; 
but God knows, when it became my duty, I did try. I 
kept it before me every hour. Perhaps it is from this 
very bitter experience that I know how to pity Alfred ; ” 
and all the tenderness of Sympathy lights up her eyes. 

That is put in another little grave. 

We seldom speak of Mr. Ross now, though Theo still 
wears her wedding-ring and her ill-fated opal. Was it a 
token of destiny? 

We do not go anywhere this vacation. Insurance, 
interest, and taxes have become household watchwords. 
Father looks drearily into the future. 

If Archie had only lived ! 

Richard is a bright, pleasant young lad, fond of us all ; 
yet in his estimation we are rather old-maidish. Theo 
and I, remembering the Misses Dayton and other elder 
sisters, do not try to restrain, or insist that he shall stay 
at home with us, and think our rather grave thoughts. 

“ He wull never be so noble and tender and loving as 
Archie,” I say to mother. 

“ My dear, Archie was not so thoughtful in boyhood,” 
mother replies, with a peculiar softness in her voice; 
“ and that last year he gave us his whole soul.” 


 


What father is to do hereafter is a troubled question. 

“ There is no more real hard work for you,” says Dr. 
Sheldon authoritatively. “You cannot stand it. A posi- 
tion in a store, or some light manufacturing ; since it will
