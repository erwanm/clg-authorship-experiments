 

and ears that were like a delicate shell, to say noth- 
ing of the dimpled fists, doubled up as if he held a 
fortune inside of them. 

Mrs. Darrell came in to welcome Kathie. They 
had waited supper for the travellers, and now all was 
ready. Jessie decided not to go down, as she had 
been about considerably during the day, but begged 
them not to hurry on her account. 

Mr. Meredith declared he was dying to have Ka- 
thie's opinion of the baby. Was it not the smartest 
and most beautiful baby she had ever seen ? 

" I do not feel competent to judge of its abilities 
on so short an acquaintance," she answered, with 
mock seriousness. " He certainly looks pretty." 

" You will have a proof of his ability before this 
time to-morrow," Mr. Meredith returned, laughingly. 
" He is a noisy little youngster when he starts about 
it. I have my suspicions that he means to pattern 
after Eobert the second." 

" I am afraid we all had a touch of the complaint," 
said Uncle Eobert. 

" Noise and boys and Fourth of July and fireworks 
are connected together by an indestructible chain." 

" I am sure he is a very good baby," said Mrs. Dar- 



 

rell, rather resenting the inference. " He would not 
know much if he did not know how to cry." 

" Now really ! " was Mr. Meredith's quizzical re- 
joinder. " Well, we will give him the credit of being 
amiable by spells. I think it would be a good plan 
to keep Kathie here for nurse." 

Kathie smiled. The two gentlemen lingered over 
their dessert, as they had fallen into a business talk, 
and, begging to be excused, she ran up stairs to Jes- 
sie. The baby was up now, staring at the light with 
a wide intentness in his eyes, as if he was determined 
to fathom the mystery. 

" O, can't I hold him a little while ? " Kathie ex- 
claimed, and Jessie put him in her arms. 

He studied her then in his deliberate baby fashion, 
and gave a soft, gurgling sound that was inexpressibly 
sweet. 

" He is a darling ! " said Kathie, delightedly. 

Mr. Meredith asked her. when he came up, if she 
had already engaged, what her wages were, and how 
many days " out " she must have. Baby seemed to 
have forgotten his worrying spell, for he sat quiet in 
her lap, soothed by the caressing voice, until his eye- 
lids began to droop. 



 

" He is on his very best behavior," declared his 
father. " You see he does not wish to frighten you 
in the beginning." 

Jessie laid him in the crib presently, and then she 
book Kathie to her room to show her all his pretty 
clothes.
