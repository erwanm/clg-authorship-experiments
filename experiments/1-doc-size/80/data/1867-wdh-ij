ode of the ' America Libera,' " and thus finished 
that poem ? 

After copying these verses we returned to the 
dining-room, and while one pilgrim strayed idly 
through the names in the visitor's book, the other 
sketched Petrarch's cat, before mentioned, and Pe- 
trarch's inkstand of bronze a graceful little thing, 
having a cover surmounted by a roguish cupid, while 
the lower part is supported on three lion's claws, and 
just above the feet, at either of the three corners, 
is an exquisite little female bust and head. Thus 
sketching and idling, we held spell-bound our friends 
the youth of Arqua, as well as our driver, who, hav- 
ing brought innumerable people to see the house of 
Petrarch, now for the first time, with great astonish- 
ment, beheld the inside of it himself. 



 

As to the authenticity of the house I think there 
can be no doubt, and as to the genuineness of the 
relics there, nothing in the world could shake my 
faith in them, though Muratori certainly characterizes 
them as " superstitions." The great poet was sixty- 
five years old when he came to rest at Arqua, and 
when, in his own pathetic words, " there remained 
to him only to consider and to desire how to make a 
good end." He says further, at the close of his au- 
tobiography : "In one of the Euganean hills, near 
to ten. miles from the city of Padua, I have built me 
a house, small but pleasant and decent, in the midst 
of slopes clothed with vines and olives, abundantly 
sufficient for a family not large and discreet. Here 
I lead my life, and although, as I have said, infirm 
of body, yet tranquil of mind, without excitements, 
without distractions, without cares, reading always, 
and writing and praising God, and thanking God as 
well for evil as for good ; which evil, if I err not, is 
trial merely and not punishment. And all the while 
I pray to Christ that he make good the end of my 
life, and have mercy on me, and forgive me, and even 
forget my youthful sins ; wherefore, in this solitude, 
no words are so sweet to my lips as these of the 
psalm : ' Delicta juventutis mece, et ignorantias meas ne 
memineris.' And with every feeling of the heart I 
pray God, when it please Him, to bridle my thoughts, 
so long unstable and erring ; and as they have vainly 
wandered to many things, to turn them all to Him 
only true, certain, immutable Good." 

I venerate the house at Arqua because these 



 

sweet and solemn words were written in it. We left 
its revered shelter (after taking a final look from the 
balcony down upon " the slopes clothed with vines 
and olives") and returned to the lower village, 
where, in the court of the little church, we saw the 
tomb of Petrarch " an ark of red stone, upon four 
columns likewise of marble." The epitaph is this : 

Frigida Francisci lapis hie tegit ossa Petrarcse ; 
Suscipe, Virgo parens, animam ; sate Virgine, parce 
Fessaque jam terris Coeli requiescat in arce." 

A head of the poet in bronze surmounts the ark. 
The housekeeper of the parish priest, who ran out to 
enjoy my admiration and bounty, told me a wild lo- 
cal tradition of an attempt on the part of the Flor- 
entines to steal the bones of Petrarch away from 
Arqu&, in proof of which she showed me a block of 
marble set into the ark, whence she said a fragment 
had been removed by the Florentines. This local 
tradition I afterwards found verified, with names and
