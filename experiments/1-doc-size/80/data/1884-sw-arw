have no dissenters in his house. Esther paused, not 
certainly to listen, but with a sudden check arising 
from something in the tone of the words. As she 
stood still in doubt whether to go forward or not, 
a word or two more were spoken, and also heard; 
and with that, Esther turned short about, left all 
thought of her lesson, and made her way home ; 
walking rather faster than she had come. 
She laid off her hat, went into the room where 
her father was, and sat down in the window with 
a book. 
" Home again, Esther ? " said he. " You have 
not been long away." 
"No, papa." 
" Did you have your lesson ? " 
"No, papa." 
 
"Why not?" 
" Pitt was talking to somebody." 
The colonel made no further remark, and the 
room was very still for awhile. Until after an hour 
or more the colonel's book went down; and then 
Esther from her window spoke again. 
" Papa, if you please, what is a dissenter ? " 
" A what ? " demanded the colonel, rousing him 
self. 
"A dissenter, papa." 
** What do you know about dissenters ? " 
" Nothing, papa. What is it ? " 
" What makes you ask ? " 
" I heard the word, papa, and I didn't know 
what it meant." 
"There is no need you should know what it 
means. A dissenter is one who dissents." 
"From what, sir?" 
" From something that other people believe in." 
" But papa, according to that then, everybody is 
a dissenter; and that is not true, is it?" 
" What has put the question into your head ? " 
"I heard somebody speaking of dissenters." 
"Whom?" . 
" Mrs. Dallas." 
" Ah ! " The colonel smiled grimly. " She might 
be speaking of you and me." 
Esther knew that to have been the fact, but she 
did not say so. She only asked, 
" What do we dissent from, papa." 
" We dissent from the notion that form is more 
than substance and the kernel less valuable than 
the shell." 
This told Esther nothing. She was mystified ; at 
the same time her respect for her father did not allow her to press further a question he seemed to 
avoid. 
" Is Pitt a dissenter, papa ? " 
" There is no need you should trouble your head 
with the question of dissent, my child. In England there is an Established church ; all who decline 
to come into it are there called Dissenters." 
"Does it tire you to have me ask questions, papa?" 
"No." 
" Who established the church there ? " 
"The Government." 
" What for ? " 
"Wanted to rule men's consciences as well as 
their bodies." 
" But a government cannot do that, papa ? " 
"They have tried, Esther. Tried by fire and 
sword, and cruelty, and persecution ; by fines and 
imprisonments and disqualifications. Some sub 
mitted, but a goodly number dissented; and our 
family has always belonged to that honourable 
number. See you do it no discredit. The Gainsboroughs were always Independents; we fought 
with Cromwell, and suffered under the Stuarts. 
We have an unbroken record of striving for the 
right. Keep to your traditions, my dear." 
"But why should a Government wish to rule 
people's consciences, papa ? " 
 
" Power, my dear. As long as men's minds are 
free, there is something where power does not 
reach."
