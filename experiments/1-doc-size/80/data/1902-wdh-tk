" Oh, I say!" 

At the moment Boyne 's intellectual seance with 
Miss Rasmith was coming to an end. Lottie had 
tacitly invited Mr. Pogis to prolong the compari- 



 

son of English and American family life by stopping 
in front of a couple of steamer-chairs, and con 
fessing that she was tired to death. They sat down, 
and he told her about his mother, whom, although 
his father 's subordinate, he seemed to be rather 
fonder of. He had some elder brothers, most of 
them in the colonies, and he had himself been out 
to America looking at something his father had 
found for him in Buffalo. 

"You ought to come to Tuskingum," said Lot 
tie. 

"Is that a large place?" Mr. Pogis asked. "As 
large as Buffalo?" 

" Well, no," Lottie admitted. " But it 's a growing 
place. And we have the best kind of times." 

" What kind ?" The young man easily consented 
to turn the commercial into a social inquiry. 

" Oh, picnics, and river parties, and buggy-rides, 
and dances." 

" I 'm keen on dancing," said Mr. Pogis. " I hope 
they 'll give us a dance on board. Will you put me 
down for the first dance?" 

" I don 't care. Will you send me some flowers ? 
The steward must have some left in the refriger 
ator." 

" Well, rather ! I 'll send you a spray, if he 's got 
enough." 

"A spray? What 's a spray?" 

" Oh, I say ! My sister always wears one. It 's 
a long chain of flowers reachin from your shoulder 
diagonally down to your waist." 



 

" Does your sister always have her sprays sent 
to her?" 

"Well, rather! Don 't they send flowers to girls 
for dances in the States?" 

"Well, rather! Didn 't I just ask you?" 

This was very true, and after a moment of baffle 
Mr. Pogis said, in generalization, "If you go with 
a young lady in a party to the theatre you send her 
a box of chocolates." 

" Only when you go to the theatre ! I couldn 't 
get enough, then, unless you asked me every night," 
said Lottie, and while Mr. Pogis was trying to 
choose between " Oh, I say !" and something spe 
cific, like, "I should like to ask you every night," 
she added, "And what would happen if you sent 
a girl a spray for the theatre and chocolates for 
a dance? Wouldn 't it jar her?" 

Now, indeed, there was nothing for him but to 
answer, " Oh, I say !"
