course ; but what you are after, is a puzzle to me.' 

' Things are very often a puzzle to me,' said Diana 
vaguely ; and having for some reason or other a good deal 
of difficulty in commanding herself. 

' Aren't you tired ? ' 

' No. I don't know,' said Diana. ' It does not 
signify.' 

' I don't believe you care, any more than a soldier, what 
you find in your way. Do you know, you said something, 
up yonder at the camp fire, which has been running in my 
head ever since ? I wish you would explain it.' 

' I ? ' said Diana. ' I said something ? What ? ' 

' I told you what I wanted, and you said you had no 
doubt I could get it.' 

' I have no recollection of one thing or the other, Mr. 
Knowlton. I think you must have been speaking to somebody else at the time not me. If you please, I will try 



the bushes that way; I think somebody has been in this 
place.' 

'Don't you remember my telling you I always want the 
best of everything?' he said as he followed her ; and Diana went too fast for him to hold the briary branches out 
of her way. 

' There are so many other people who are of that mind, 
Mr. Knowlton ! ' 

' Not yourself ? ' 

' I want the best berries,' said Diana, stopping before a 
cluster of bushes heavily laden. 

' How about other things ? ' 

Diana felt a pang at her heart, an odd desire to make 
some wild answer. But nothing could be cooler than what 
she said. 

' I take them as I find them, Mr. Knowlton.' 

He was helping her now again. 

'What did you suppose I was thinking of, when I told 
you I wanted the best I could have ? ' 

' I had no right to suppose anything. No doubt it is 
true of all sorts of things.' 

' But I was thinking of one did you guess what ? ' 

Diana hesitated. ' I don't know, Mr. Knowlton, I 
might guess wrong.' 

' Then what made you say, " no doubt " I could have 
it?' 

'I don't know, Mr. Knowlton,' said Diana, feeling irritated and worried almost past her power to bear. ' Don't 
you always have what you want ? ' 

' Do you think I can ? ' he said eagerly. 

' I fancy you do.' 

' What did you think I meant by the " best " thing, then ? 
Tell me do tell me ? ' 




' I thought you meant Miss Gertrude Masters.' Diana 
said, fairly brought to bay.
