it--that’s exactly why I’m a Red, I know it’s wrong for anyone to be
poor, and there’s no excuse for it. So I shall help to overthrow the
capitalist system, even if it means I have to take in washing for my
living!”

Peter sat watching her in the crisp freshness of her snowy chiffons.
The words brought a horrible image to his mind; he suddenly found
himself back in the tenement kitchen, where fat and steaming Mrs.
Yankovich was laboring elbow deep in soap-suds. It was on the tip of
Peter’s tongue to say: “If you really had done a day’s washing, Mrs.
Godd, you wouldn’t talk like that!”

But he remembered that he must play the game, so he said, “They’re
terrible fellows, them Federal agents. It was two of them pounded me
over the head last night.” And then he looked faint and pitiful, and
Mrs. Godd was sympathetic again, and moved to more recklessness of
utterance.

“It’s because of this hideous war!” she declared. “We’ve gone to war
to make the world safe for democracy, and meantime we have to
sacrifice every bit of democracy at home. They tell you that you
must hold your peace while they murder one another, but they may try
all they please, they’ll never be able to silence me! I know that
the Allies are just as much to blame as the Germans, I know that
this is a war of profiteers and bankers; they may take my sons and
force them into the army, but they cannot take my convictions and
force them into their army. I am a pacifist, and I am an
internationalist; I want to see the workers arise and turn out of
office these capitalist governments, and put an end to this hideous
slaughter of human beings. I intend to go on saying that so long as
I live.” There sat Mrs. Godd, with her lovely firm white hands
clasped as if in prayer, one large diamond ring on the left fourth
finger shining defiance, and a look of calm, child-like conviction
upon her face, confronting in her imagination all the federal agents
and district attorneys and capitalist judges and statesmen and
generals and drill sergeants in the civilized world.

She went on to tell how she had attended the trial of three pacifist
clergymen a week or two previously. How atrocious that Christians in
a Christian country should be sent to prison for trying to repeat
the words of Christ! “I was so indignant,” declared Mrs. Godd, “that
I wrote a letter to the judge. My husband said I would be committing
contempt of court by writing to a judge during the trial, but I
answered that my contempt for that court was beyond anything I could
put into writing. Wait--”

And Mrs. Godd rose gravely from her chair and went over to a desk by
the wall, and got a copy of the letter. “I’ll read it to you,” she
said, and Peter listened to a manifesto of Olympian Bolshevism--

To His Honor:

As I entered the sanctuary, I gazed upward to the stained glass
dome, upon which were inscribed four words: Peace. Justice. Truth.
Law--and I felt hopeful. Before me were men who had violated no
constitutional right, who had not the slightest criminal tendency,
who, were opposed to violence of every kind.

The trial proceeded. I looked again at the beautiful stained glass
dome, and whispered to myself those majestic-sounding words: “Peace.
Justice. Truth. Law.” I listened to the prosecutors; the Law in
their hands was a hard, sharp, cruel blade, seeking insistently,
relentlessly for a weak spot in the armor of its victims. I listened
to their Truth, and it was Falsehood. Their Peace was a cruel and
bloody War. Their justice was a net to catch the victims at any
cost--at the cost of all things but the glory of the Prosecutor’s
office.

I grew sick at heart. I can only ask myself the old, old question:
What can we, the people do? How can we bring Peace, justice, Truth
and Law to the world? Must we go on bended knees and ask our public
servants to see that justice is done to the defenceless, rather than
this eternal prosecuting of the world’s noblest souls! You will find
these men guilty, and sentence them to be shut behind iron
bars--which should never be for human beings, no matter what their
crime, unless you want to make beasts of them. Is that your object,
sir? It would seem so; and so I say that we must overturn the system
that is brutalizing, rather than helping and uplifting mankind.

Yours for Peace..Justice..Truth..Law--
