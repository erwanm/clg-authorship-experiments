were less accessible, that here he found barriers in his 
path, only added to the zest of forcing an entrance. He 
abounded in pretexts ; he even sometimes brought contri- 
butions ; he was persistent and penetrating, he was known 
as the irrepressible Tarrant. He hung about, sat too long, 
took up the time of busy people, edged into the printing- 
rooms when he had been eliminated from the office, talked 
with the compositors till they set up his remarks by 
mistake, and to the newsboys when the compositors had 
turned their backs. He was always trying to find out 
what was 'going in'; he would have liked to go in himself, 
bodily, and, failing in this, he hoped to get advertisements 
inserted gratis. The wish of his soul was that he might be 
interviewed ; that made him hover at the editorial elbow. 
Once he thought he had been, and the headings, five or 
six deep, danced for days before his eyes ; but the report 
never appeared. He expected his revenge for this the 
day after Verena should have burst forth ; he saw the 
attitude in which he should receive the emissaries who 
would come after his daughter.

' WE ought to have some one to meet her,' Mrs. Tarrant 
said ; ' I presume she wouldn't care to come out just to see 
us.' ' She,' between the mother and the daughter, at this 
period, could refer only to Olive Chancellor, who was dis- 
cussed in the little house at Cambridge at all hours and 
from every possible point of view. It was never Verena 
now who began, for she had grown rather weary of the 
topic ; she had her own ways of thinking of it, which were 
not her mother's, and if she lent herself to this lady's 
extensive considerations it was because that was the best 
way of keeping her thoughts to herself. 

Mrs. Tarrant had an idea that she (Mrs. Tarrant) liked 
to study people, and that she was now engaged in an 
analysis of Miss Chancellor. It carried her far, and she 
came out at unexpected times with her results. It was still 
her purpose to interpret the world to the ingenuous mind 
of her daughter, and she translated Miss Chancellor with a 
confidence which made little account of the fact that she 
had seen her but once, while Verena had this advantage 
nearly every day. Verena felt that by this time she knew 
Olive very well, and her mother's most complicated versions 
of motive and temperament (Mrs. Tarrant, with the most 
imperfect idea of the meaning of the term, was always 
talking about people's temperament), rendered small justice 
to the phenomena it was now her privilege to observe in 
Charles Street Olive was much more remarkable than 
Mrs. Tarrant suspected, remarkable as Mrs. Tarrant believed 
her to be. She had opened Verena's eyes to extraordinary 
pictures, made the girl believe that she had a heavenly 
mission, given her, as we have seen, quite a new measure 
of the interest of life. These were larger consequences

than the possibility of meeting the leaders of society at 
Olive's house. She had met no one, as yet, but Mrs. 
Luna ; her new friend seemed to wish to keep her quite 
for herself. This was the only reproach that Mrs. Tarrant 
directed to the new friend as yet ; she was disappointed 
that Verena had not obtained more insight into the world 
of fashion. It was one of the prime articles of her faith 
that the world of fashion was wicked and hollow, and, 
moreover, Verena told her that Miss Chancellor loathed 
and despised it. She could not have informed you wherein 
it would profit her daughter (for the way those ladies shrank 
from any new gospel was notorious) ; nevertheless she was 
vexed that Verena shouldn't come back to her with a little 
more of the fragrance of Beacon Street. The girl herself 
would have been the most interested person in the world if 
she had not been the most resigned ; she took all that was 
given her and was grateful, and missed nothing that was 
withheld ; she was the most extraordinary mixture of eager-
