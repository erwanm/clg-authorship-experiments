carpenter. “He has done just what most of you would if you had been in
his place. What is that mallet for, Thad?”

“To hit with, just as your fist is,” replied the amateur workman,
laughing.

“To strike with, and that is just what your fist is not for. You are
never to strike a wooden tool, or the wooden handle of a tool, with a
hammer or a hatchet. Can you all remember that, my lads?”

“Yes, sir!” shouted all the boys.

“Don’t do it, then. A mallet is used in striking a chisel.”

Thad took the mallet, and hit the chisel a tremendous crack with it.
The tool happened to be in a rather loose place in the opening, and it
went in to the handle. Thad tried to draw it out. He pulled and tugged
and wrenched at the chisel, but it was in firm enough to resist all
his efforts. He was so much in earnest, that his attempts amused the
rest of the boys; and they were soon laughing with all their might.
The machinists at the other end of the shop were interested, and some
of them went over to see what the excitement was. But they were called
back by Mr. Jepson before they could see inside of the ring that
surrounded Thad.

“Pull away, my lad,” laughed the master-carpenter. “But when you get
tired of the work, let me know, if you please.”

“I can’t get it out,” replied Thad, when he discovered that he was the
laughing-stock of the class.

“Perhaps you can, if you keep on wrenching for a day or two longer.”

“I have done my best, and it won’t come out.”

“I don’t think it will under any such treatment,” added Mr. Brookbine.
“You laugh, boys, because it is funny; but I doubt if the majority of
you would have done any better. Here is a lesson to learn. Skill is
better than strength, but skill and strength win the battle.”

“Good!” shouted Steve Baxter. “I will remember that as long as I live:
skill and strength win the battle.”

“I hope you will all remember it, for it is just the motto for a
carpenter. The ‘improvement,’ as the minister would say, upon the
text, is this: When things don’t work right, and won’t do as you want
and expect them to do, don’t yank, twist, jerk, and wrench at them.
Something is the matter, and you must see what it is. That chisel
would not come out. Why not?”

“It is in too tight,” replied Dick Short.

“Right, Dick: what is to be done?”

“Loosen it, if you can.”

“Dory, you may try your hand at it, taking the chisel as you find it.”

Dory had been studying the situation, and had made up his mind what to
do. Taking the hatchet, he inserted the edge of it in the crack, near
the chisel, and drove it in with the mallet. The chisel dropped out of
itself. But the hatchet stuck as hard as the chisel had.

“Good, so far, Dory; but your chisel is in chancery,” said the
carpenter.

“What is sauce for goose is sauce for gander,” replied Dory as he picked
up the chisel, and inserted it in the opening made by the hatchet.
Twisting the hatchet a little, he started the nails with which the
cover of the box was secured.

In the manner described, Dory alternately used the tools till he had
gone half-way round the box, when he and Thad took hold of the board
with their hands, and pulled it off.

“That was very well done,” said the carpenter. “But the board could
have been taken off without pulling it off with the hands.”

“I know it, Mr. Brookbine; but that was the quicker way to do it,”
replied Dory.
