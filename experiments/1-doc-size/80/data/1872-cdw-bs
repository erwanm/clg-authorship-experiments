The Parson's vehemence came very near carry 
ing him into a sermon ; and as nobody has the 
privilege of replying to his sermons, so none of 
the circle made any reply now. 
Our Next Door mumbled something about his 
hair standing on end, to hear a minister defend 
ing the novel ; but it did not interrupt the gen 
eral silence. Silence is unnoticed when people 
sit before a fire ; it would be intolerable if they 
sat and looked at each other. 
The wind had risen during the evening, and 
Mandeville remarked, as they rose to go, that it

had a spring sound in it, but it was as cold as 
winter. The Mistress said she heard a bird that 
morning singing in the sun ; it was a winter 
bird, but it sang a spring song. 
have been much interested in what 
is called the Gothic revival. We 
have spent I don't know how many 
evenings in looking over Herbert's plans for a 
cottage, and have been amused with his vain 
efforts to cover with Gothic roofs the vast num 
ber of large rooms which the Young Lady draws 
in her sketch of a small house. 
I have no doubt that the Gothic, which is capa 
ble of infinite modification, so that every house 
built in that style may be as different from every 
other house as one tree is from every other, can 
be adapted to our modern uses, and will be, when 
artists catch its spirit instead of merely copying 
its old forms. But just now we are taking the 
Gothic very literally, as we took the Greek at 
one time, or as we should probably have taken 
the Saracenic, if the Moors had not been colored. 
Not even the cholera is so contagious in this 
country as a style of architecture which we hap 
pen to catch ; the country is just now broken out 
all over with the Mansard-roof epidemic. 
And in secular architecture we do not study 
what is adapted to our climate any more than in 
ecclesiastic architecture we adopt that which is 
suited to our religion. 
We are building a great many costly churches 
here and there, we Protestants, and as the most 
of them are ill adapted to our forms of worship, 
it may be necessary and best for us to change 
our religion in order to save our investments. I 
am aware that this would be a grave step, and we 
should not hasten to throw overboard Luther and 
the right of private judgment without reflection. 
And yet, if it is necessary to revive the ecclesi 
astical Gothic architecture, not in its spirit (that 
we nowhere do), but in the form which served 
another age and another faith, and if, as it ap 
pears, we have already a great deal of money 
 
invested in this reproduction, it may be more 
prudent to go forward than to go back. The 
question is, "Cannot one easier change his creed 
than his pew?" 
I occupy a seat in church which is an admira 
ble one for reflection, but I cannot see or hear 
much that is going on in what we like to call the 
apse. There is a splendid stone pillar, a clus 
tered column, right in front of me, and I am as 
much protected from the minister as Old Put's 
troops were from the British, behind the stone 
wall at Bunker's Hill. I can hear his voice occa 
sionally wandering round in the arches overhead, 
and I recognize the tone, because he is a friend 
of mine. and an excellent man, but what he is say 
ing I can very seldom make out. If there was any 
incense burning I could smell it, and that would 
be something. I rather like the smell of incense, 
and it has its holy associations. But there is 
no smell in our church, except of bad air, for 
there is no provision for ventilation in the splen
