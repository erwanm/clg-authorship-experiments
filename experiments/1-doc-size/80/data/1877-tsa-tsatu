of Mrs. Fielding one evening, as she came back 
from the apartment where the children slept, to 
their family sitting-room he had listened, as he 
sat alone to the tender inflections of her voice as 
she talked with, and read to them ; that voice 
stirring emotion deeper and deeper, like music to 
which the heart lifts itself in sweet responses. 
"As you are, and have been, for years their true 




mother, will you not be a mother to them in 
name also ?" 

He held the hand tightly, and looked into her 
face. Her eyes, startled at first, dropped away 
from his, and fell upon the floor. Mr. Garland 
felt an impulse in her hand, as if she were about 
to withdraw it, and his, with a responsive im 
pulse took hold with a firmer clasp. 

"The currents of our lives," he said in his 
calm, true, earnest voice, " have in God 's provi 
dence been for some time running side by side, 
taking equally the sunshine and shade, and feel 
ing, almost as one, the rippling breezes. Shall 
they not flow together ? I testify, here, to your 
dignified, womanly conduct in every relation in 
my home. You have been true to yourself and 
your sex in all things. So true, that from respect 
and admiration, a deeper and tenderer feeling to

And now, Mrs. Fielding, how stands the case? 
Shall our lives flow together as a single stream ?

imperceptible respiration. When she raised her 
eyes, slowly, they were wet with blinding tears, 
and her lips had an irrepressible quiver ; but Mr. 
Garland saw light shining through the tears, and 
consent on her trembling inarticulate lips. He 
led her to a scat. 

" I have not sought this, Mr. Garland heaven 
be my witness " Her delicate woman 's na 
ture shrank. 

"And I am also your witness, dear, true, right- 
hearted friend, whom God his ways are not as 
our ways has so kindly led to my side! Be 
nearer and dearer to me than a friend ; that is, if 
in your heart you can draw nearer. I do not 
want the hand I hold unless all that can bless a 
man goes with it." 

And the blessing was his. 

How sweetly, purely, and tranquilly flowed 
their stream of life, full to the grassy and flower- 
decked brim ! a true man and a true woman, 



 

with high aims and heaven-rising aspirations, 
walked onward side by side in duty and love, 
and not a heart-throb beat in discord. Could an 
idle, sorrowing, self-afflicting life have so crowned 
the years of Mrs. Fielding with blessing ? It is 
only along the path of usefulness that the Lord 
can lead to life 's best fruitions here, and tht
