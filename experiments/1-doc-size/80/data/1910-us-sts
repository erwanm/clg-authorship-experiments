said Mr. Wygant, " I have many responsibih' 
ties upon my shoulders — many interests looking 
to me for protection. And it is as if I were sur- 
roimded by a pack of wolves." 

" But meantime," cried Samuel, " what is be- 
coming of free government? " 

" I do not know," the other replied. " I some- 
times think that unless the people reform, free 
government will soon come to an end." 

" But what are the people to do, sir? " 

" They are to elect honest men, with whom one 
can do business — instead of the peasant saloon 
keepers and blatherskite labor leaders whom they 
choose at present." 

Samuel thought for a moment. " Men with 
whom one can do business," he said — " but what 
kind of business do you want to do? " 





" How do you mean? " asked the other. 

" You went to those politicians and got a fran- 
chise that will let you tax the people whatever 
you please for ninety-nine years. And do you 
think that was good business for the people? " 

There was no reply to this. 

" And how much of the property you are 
protecting was made in such ways as that, 
sir?" 

A frown had come upon Mr. Wygant's fore- 
head. But no one could gaze into Samuel's ago- 
nized face and remain angry. 

" Yoimg man," said he. " I can only tell you 
again that you do not know the world. If I 
should step out, would things be any different? 
The franchises would go to some other crowd — 
that is all. It is the competition of capital." 

" The competition of capital," reflected the 
boy. " In other words, there is a scramble for 
money, and you get what you can! " 

" You may put it that way, sir." 

" And you think that your responsibility ends 
when you've got a share for yoiu* crowd! " 

" Yes — I suppose that is it." 

There was a pause. " I see perfectly," said 
Samuel, in a low voice. " There's only one thing 
I can't understand." 

" What is that? " 

" Why you should belong to the church, sir? 





What has this money scramble to do with the 
teaching of Jesus? " 

And then Samuel saw that he had overstepped 
the mark. " Really, young man," said Mr. Wy- 
gant, " I cannot see what is to be gained by pur- 
suing this conversation."
