have said things and such things: say it all 
comes from her!" 

"Oh, you dreadful is that what you do?" 
cried Francie, shaking herself free. The door 
opened as she spoke and Mme. de Brecourt 
walked quickly to the window, turning her back. 
Mme. de Cliche was there and Mr. Probert and 
M. de Brecourt and M. de Cliche. They entered 
in silence and M. de Brecourt, coming last, closed 
the door softly behind him. Francie had never 
been in a court of justice, but if she had had that 
experience these four persons would have reminded 
her of the jury filing back into their box with their 
verdict. They all looked at her hard as she stood 
in the middle of the room ; Mme. de Brecourt gazed 







out of the window, wiping her eyes ; Mme. de 
Clich^ grasped a newspaper, crumpled and partly 
folded. Francie got a quick impression, moving 
her eyes from one face to another, that old Mr. 
Probert was the worst; his mi]d, ravaged expres 
sion was terrible. He was the one who looked at 
her least; he went to the fireplace and leaned 
on the mantel, with his head in his hands. He 
seemed ten years older. 

"Ah, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, mademoi 
selle!" said Maxime de Cliche, slowly, impressively, 
in a tone of the most respectful but most poignant 
reproach. 

" Have you seen it have they sent it to you ? " 
his wife asked, thrusting the paper towards her. 
" It s quite at your service ! " But as Francie 
neither spoke nor took it she tossed it upon the 
sofa, where, as it opened, falling, the girl read 
the name of the Reverberator. Mme. de Cliche 
carried her head very far back. 

" She has nothing to do with it it s just as 
I told you she s overwhelmed," said Mme. de 
Brecon rt, remaining at the window. 

" You would do well to read it it s worth the 
trouble," Alphonse de Brecourt remarked, going- 
over to his wife. Francie saw him kiss her as 
he perceived her tears. She was angry at her 
own ; she choked and swallowed them ; they 
seemed somehow to put her in the wrong. 

" Have you had no idea that any such mon- 


strosity would be perpetrated ? " Mme. de Cliche 
went on, coming nearer to her. She had a manner 
of forced calmness as if she wished it to be un 
derstood that she was one of those who could be 
reasonable under any provocation, though she were 
trembling within which made Francie draw back. 
" C est pourtant rempli de choses which we know 
you to have been told of by what folly, great 
heaven ! It s right and left no one is spared it s 
a deluge of insult. My sister perhaps will have 
told you of the apprehensions I had I couldn 't 
resist them, though I thought of nothing so awful 
as this, God knows, the day I met you at Mr. 
Waterlow s with your journalist." 

" I have told her everything don 't you see she s 
andantie ? Let her go, let her go ! " exclaimed 
Mme. de Brecourt, still at the window. 

" Ah, your journalist, your journalist, mademoi
