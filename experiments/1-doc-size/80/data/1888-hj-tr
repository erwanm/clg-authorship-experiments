the girl went on, determined not to notice this 
sentimental allusion. 

" What do you care ? It wouldn 't even be 
delicate in me to tell you ; for I do remember the 
way you said you would try and get your father to 
help me. Don 't say you've  forgotten it, because 
you almost made me cry. Any way, that isn 't the 
sort of help I want now and it wasn 't the sort of 
help I meant to ask you for then. I want sympathy 
and interest ; I want some one to whisper once in 
a w hile c Courage, courage ; you 'll come out all 
right. You see I'm a working man and I don 't 
pretend to be anything else," Mr. Flack went on. 
" I don 't live on the accumulations of my ancestors. 
What I have I earn what I am I've  fought 
for : I'm a tmvailleur, as they say here. I rejoice

same."

a friend after all." 

Francie rested her eyes for a moment on the 
carpet ;- then, raising them " Where should you 
like to go ? " 

" You could render me a service a real service 
without any inconvenience, probably, to yourself. 
Isn 't your portrait finished ? " 

" Yes, but he won 't give it up." 

" Who won 't give it up ? " 

"Why, Mr. Waterlow. He wants to keep it 
near him to look at in case he should take a fancy 
to change it. But I hope he won 't change it it s 
so pretty as it is ! " Francie declared, smiling. 

" I hear it s magnificent, and I want to see it," 
said George Flack. 

" Then why don 't you go ? " 

"I 'll go if you 'll take me ; that s the service 
you can render me." 







"Why, I thought you went everywhere into 
the palaces of kings ! " Francie cried. 

" I go where I'm welcome, not where I'm not. 
I don 't want to push into that studio _ alone ; he
