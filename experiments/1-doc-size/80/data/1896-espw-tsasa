the chimes rang, and the audiences were, on the 
whole, as comfortable and as devout as usual. 

The vestryman sat nervously in his pew. He 
had not fully recovered from the fact that his 
supply had disappointed him. Having sent his coach 
man in vain to all the Saturday evening trains to 
meet his country parson, the vestryman had passed 
but an uneasy night. 

" I had supposed the old man had principles 
about Sunday travel," he said to his wife, " but it 
seems he is coming in the morning, after all. He 
might at least have sent me word." 

" Telegraphing in the country is difficult, 
sometimes, I have heard," replied the lady, vaguely. 
She was a handsome, childless woman, with the 
haughty under lip of her class. Her husband spoke 
cheerily, but he was not at ease, and she did not 
know how to make him so. 




The Sunday morning train came in from the 
country station forty miles back, but the old clergy 
man was not among its passengers. Now thoroughly 
alarmed, the vestryman had started for his hat and 
coat, when his parlor-maid brought him a message. 
It had been left at the door, she said, by a 
messenger who brooked neither delay nor question, but 
ordered her to tell the master of the house that the 
supply for Saint Agatha's was in the city, and would 
meet the engagement at the proper time and place. 
The old clergyman, the messenger added, had been 
suddenly stricken with a dangerous illness, and 
could not be expected; but his substitute would 
fill the pulpit for the day. The vestryman was 
requested to feel no concern in the matter. The 
preacher preferred retirement until the hour of the 
service, and would fulfil his duties at the church at 
the appointed hour. 

But when the vestryman, feeling flurried despite 
himself, tapped at the door of the luxurious vestry- 
room, gracefully refurnished that winter for the 
rector with the sore throat who was in the south of 
France, he found it locked ; and to his unobtrusive 
knock no answer came. At this uncomfortable moment 
the sexton tiptoed up to say that the supply 




had requested not to be disturbed until the service 
should begin. The sexton supposed that the clergy 
man needed extra preparation ; thought that perhaps 
the gentleman was from the country, and ah 
unused to the audience. 

" What is his name ? What does he look like ? " 
asked the chairman, with knotted brows. 

" I have not seen him sir,' replied the sexton, 
with a puzzled expression. 

" How did you receive the message ? " 

" By a messenger who would not be delayed or 
questioned." 

Struck by the repetition of this phrase, the chair 
man asked again : 

" But what did the messenger look like ? " The 
sexton shook his head. 

" I cannot tell you, sir. He was a mere messen 
ger. I paid no attention to him."
