Spicer had " caught a Tartar." 


Bobby hastened home, as we said at the conclusion 

of the last chapter. He was as happy as a lord. He 
had fish enough in his basket for dinner, and for break- 
fast the next morning, and money enough in his pocket to make his mother as happy as a queen, if queens 
are always happy. 



 

The widow Bright, though she had worried and 
Tretted night and day about the money which was to 
be paid to Mr. Hardhand on the first of July, had not 
told her son any thing about it. It would only make 
him unhappy, she reasoned, and it was needless to 
make the dear boy miserable for nothing ; so Bobby 
ran home all unconscious of the pleasure which was 
in store for him. 

When he reached the front door, as he stopped to 
scrape his feet on the sharp stone there, as all con- 
siderate boys who love their mothers do, before they 
go into the house, he heard the angry tones of Mr. 
Hardhand. He was scolding and abusing his mother 
because she could not pay him the twenty-five dollars. 

Bobby's blood boiled with indignation, and his 
first impulse was to serve him as he had served Tom 
Spicer, only a few moments before ; but Bobby, as 
we have before intimated, was a peaceful boy, and 
not disposed to quarrel with any person ; so 
he contented himself with muttering a few hard 
words. 

" The wretch ! What business has he to talk to my 


mother in that style? " said he to himself. " I have 
a great mind to kick him out of the house." 

But Bobby's better judgment came to his aid ; and 
perhaps he realized that he and his mother would 
only get kicked out in return. He could battle with 
Mr. Hardhand, but not with the power which his 
wealth gave him ; so, like a great many older persons 
in similar circumstances, he took counsel of prudence 
rather than impulse. 

" Bear ye one another's burdens," saith the Scrip- 
ture ; but Bobby was not old enough or astute enough 
to realize that Mr. Hardhand' s burden was his wealth, 
his love of money ; that it made him little better than 
a Hottentot ; and he could not feel as charitably 
towards him as a Christian should towards his erring, 
weak brother. 

Setting his pole by the door, he entered the room 
where Hardhand was abusing his mother. 



 



CHAPTER IV. 

IN WHICH BOBBY GETS OUT OF ONE SCRAPE, ANT) 

INTO ANOTHER. 

BOBBY was so indignant at the conduct of Mr. 
Hardhand, that he entirely forgot the adventure of
