all these things certainly would steal if he got a good 
chance. Our hero's judgment, therefore, of the case 
was not favorable to the bully, and he would have 
thanked him to stay away from the river while he 
was there. 
" Hallo, Bob ! How are you ? ' shouted Tom, 
when he had come within hailing distance. 
" Very well," replied Bobby, rather coolly. 
" Been to Boston, they say." 
" Yes." 
" Well, how did you like it ? " continued Tom, as 
he seated himself on the rock near our hero. 
" First rate." 
" Been to work there ? ' 
"No." 
" What have you been doing? ' 
" Travelling about." - 
" What doing ? " 
" Selling books." 
" Was you, though? Did you sell any? " 
" Yes, a few." 
" How many? ' 
" 0, about fifty." 
" You didn't, though did you ? How much did 
you make ? ' 
" About fifteen dollars." 
" By jolly ! You are a smart one, Bobby. There 
are not many fellows that would have done that." 
" Easy enough," replied Bobby, who was not a little 
surprised at this warm commendation from one whom 
he regarded as his enemy. 
" You had to buy the books first didn't you ? ' 
asked Tom, who began to manifest a deep interest in 
the trade. 
" Of course ; no one will give you the books." 
" What do you pay for them? " 
" I buy them so as to make a profit on them," an- 
swered Bobby, who, like a discreet merchant, was not 
disposed to be too communicative. 
" That business would suit me first rate." 
''It is pretty hard work." 
" I don't care for that. Don't you believe I could 
do something in this line ? ' 
" I don't know ; perhaps you could." 
" Why not, as well as you ? ' 
This was a hard question ; and, as Bobby did not 
wish to be uncivil, he talked about a big pout he 
hauled in at that moment, instead of answering it. 
He was politic, and deprecated the anger of the bully ; 
so, though Tom plied him pretty hard, he did not re- 
ceive much satisfaction. 
" You see, Tom," said he, when he found that his 
companion insisted upon knowing the cost of the 
books, " this is a publisher's secret ; and I dare say 
they would not wish every one to know the cost of 
books. We sell them for a dollar apiece." 
" Humph ! You needn't be so close about it. I'll 
bet I can find out." 
" I have no doubt you can ; only you see I don't 
want to tell what I am not sure they would be will- 
ing I should tell." 
Tom took a slate pencil from his pocket and 
commenced ciphering on the smooth rock upon which 
he sat. 
" You say you sold fifty books ? ' 
"Yes." 
" Well ; if you made fifteen dollars out of fifty, 
that is thirty cents apiece." 
Bobby was a little mortified when he perceived that 
he had unwittingly exposed the momentous secret. 
He had not given Tom credit for so much sagacity 
as he had displayed in his inquiries ; and as he had 
fairly reached his conclusion, he was willing he 
should have the benefit of it. 
" You sold them at a dollar apiece. Thirty from 
a hundred leaves seventy. They cost you seventy 
cents each didn't they ? ' 
" Sixty-seven," replied Bobby, yielding the point. 
" Enough said, Bob ; I am going into that business, 
any how."
