a piquant smile. " I suppose Cedarwood is still the rally- 
ing centre for all the forces, with your delightful uncle in 
the midst." 

''We do not seem to change much, only Freddy is 
almost as tall as Rob, and goes to college this fall." 

"Kathie, what will your mother do without children? 
She is the most motheiiiest mother I ever saw. You will 
all have to get married and fill the house with grandchil- 
dren." 

Mrs. Adams entered just then, and greeted Kathie 
warml\ r . 

"How much longer does your brother stay?" she 
asked. ' ' We must explain to Emma the cause of the tea 





parties going round. Mr. Robert Alston has been the 
hero of the occasion." 

" He will have to leave us on Friday evening," replied 
Kathie. " Why, the fortnight will seem like a dream." 

" You will have to rest up a little " 

" Oh," declared Emma laughingly, " I shall be rested by 
the time Mr. Langdon gets the luggage stored away. 
What a house we are making ? And I must go and see 
grandmother presently. I had only a ripple of sea-sick-

Rob, " and geniuses, too. I expect next year I shall hear 
of a certain Brookside Club that will immortalize the 
place." 

" Don't laugh at us, at me," entreated Emma. 

" I 'm not laughing. You will find a rival in Miss Col- 
lamore, and you will both have to look well to your laurels. 
Kathie's gift will declare itself next." 

" I think it did a long while ago," replied Emma softly. 

" Do you know," the latter said, a few days afterwards, 
" I think the one who has changed most of all is your 
brother Robert. He is so very different, so gentle and 
almost grave at times. I venture upon a guess, that he 
is in love with Miss Fay Collamore." 

" I think we all wish it might be," Kathie made answer 
in a curiously reverent tone. 

Indeed, the young people had been thrown much together. 
It would have been quite impossible to traverse Mrs. 





Alston's quiet directing of events. But something struck 
Uncle Robert that the mother passed by quite unremarked. 
Much as he seemed to prefer Fay, he was more careful 
than youth is wont to be, than he had ever been. It was
