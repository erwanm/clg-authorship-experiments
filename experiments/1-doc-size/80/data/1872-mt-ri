munities — a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush 
to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of 
the most rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or 
any other can exhibit. 

The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended 
from the self-same gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which- 
ever animal-Adam the Darwinians trace them to. 

One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the 
Goslioots, and yet they used to live off the offal and refuse 
of the stations a few months and then come some dark 
night when no mischief was expected, and burn down the 
buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed 
out. And once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach 
when a District Judge, of Nevada Territory, was the only 
passenger, and with their first volley of arrows (and a bullet 
or two) they riddled the stage curtains, wounded a horse or 
two and moi'tally wounded the driver. The latter was full 
of pluck, and so was his passenger. At the driver's call 
Judge Mott swung himself out, clambered to the box and 
seized the reins of the team, and away they plunged, tlirough 
the racing mob of skeletons and under a hurtling storm of 
missiles. The stricken driver had sunk down on the boot as 
soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and 
said he would manage to keep hold of them until relieved. 

And after they 
were taken from 
his relaxing 
grasp, he lay with 
his head between 
Judge Mott's 
feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the 
road ; he said he believed he could 
live till the miscreants were outrun and left behind, and that if 
he managed that, the main difficulty 
would be at an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so 
(giving directions about bad places in the road, and general 
course) he would reach the next station without trouble. The 
Judge distanced the enemy and at last rattled up to the 
station and knew that the night's perils were done; but 
there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the 
soldierly driver was dead. 

Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about 
the Overland drivers, now. The disgust which the Goshoots 
gave me, a disciple of Cooper and a worshipper of the Red 
Man — even of the scholarly savages in the " Last of the Mo- 
hicans" who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen 
who divide each sentence into two equal parts : one part crit- 
ically grammatical, refined and choice of language, and the 
other part just such an attempt to talk like a hunter or a 
mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk might make after eating an 
edition of Emerson Bennett's works and studying frontier 
life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks — I say that the 
nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, 
set me to examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been 
over-estimating the lied Man while viewinii: him throuy-h the 
mellow moonshine of romance. The revelations that came 
were disenchanting. It was curious to see how quickly the 
paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treaciierous, 
filthy and repulsive — and how quickly the evidences accumu- 
lated that wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only 
found Goshoots more or less modified by circumstances and 
surroundings — but Goshoots, after all. They deserve pity, 
poor creatures; and they can have mine — at this distance. 
Nearer by, they never get anybody's. 

There is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and 
"Washington Railroad Company and many of its employes are 
Goshoots ; but it is an error. There is only a plausible resem- 
blance, which, while it is apt enough to mislead the ignorant, 
cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both tribes. 
But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but very wrong to 
start the report referred to above ; for however innocent the 
motive may have been, the necessary effect was to injure the 
reputation of a class who have a hard enough time of it in the 
pitiless deserts of the Rocky Mountains, Heaven knows ! If 
we cannot find it in our hearts to give those poor naked crea-
