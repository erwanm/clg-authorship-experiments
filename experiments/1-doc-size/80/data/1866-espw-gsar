“ I don’t believe you know what you ’re talking 
about,” said Tom. But Gypsy did know 
very well. She had a thought which it was 
hard for her to express, and which Tom’s manner 
of receiving it stopped short. But she did not 
forget it ; it came up another time. 

“ Let ’s go ashore ; I ’m tired of this,” said 




Tom, suddenly. Gypsy took her oar, and they 
rowed ashore in silence. 

“ Gypsy ! ” said Tom, when they had walked 
a little way. 

“ Tom ! ” 

“How much do you suppose father’s going 
to put me on a year? ” 

Gypsy felt at once that she had come to the 
root of matters ; this was what Tom had come 
out into the barn to talk about. 

“ I don’t know, I ’m sure. How much? ” 

“Only six hundred.” 

“ Only six hundred ! Why, Tom, I think 
that’s ever so much.” 

“That’s because you ’re a girl,” said Tom, 
with his superior smile, “ and that ’s all you 
know.” 

“ Why, if / had six hundred dollars ! ” 
began Gypsy. But Tom interrupted. 

“ I ’d as lief be put on rations and kept in a 
guard-house, while I ’m about it. I call it 
mean.” 

“ Mean ! Why, Tom, father wouldn’t be 


mean for anything ! He ’ll give you every cent 
he can afford, and you know it. Why, Tom ! ” 

‘Well,” said Tom, rather abashed by the

that, I suppose. I guess he means to do about 
right by me ; but I call it pretty small potatoes. 
Why, Gypsy, there are fellows there who 
grumble and swear at being cut off with two 
thousand, Frank Rowe says.” 

“ But you can’t do everything the other boys 
do,” said Gypsy ; “ some of them are a great 
deal richer than you, you know. Besides, I 
don’t see how you could use more than six hundred 
dollars, if you tried to. If I could get a 
hundred, I shouldn’t know how to spend it.” 

“ My dear child,” said Tom, patronisingly, 
“ you cost father three hundred a year, if you 
cost him a cent.” 

“Three hundred? Oh, I don’t believe it!” 

“ You do, every bit of it. In the first place, 
there ’s your board isn’t a copper short of a hundred 
and fifty; then you don’t get your shoes, 
and dresses, and alpacas, and bonnets, and feathers,
and nonsense, and things, under a hundred 
more ; then — oh, school-books, and dentists’ 
bills, and windows you break, and plates you
