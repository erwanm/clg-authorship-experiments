The real spring came at last, the rapid, vivid 
spring of Mackinac. Almost in a day the ice moved 
out, the snows melted, and the northern wild-flowers 
appeared in the sheltered glens. Lessons were at an 
end, for my scholar was away in the green woods. 
Sometimes she brought me a bunch of flowers; but I 
seldom saw her ; my wild bird had flown back to the 
forest. When the ground was dry and the pine drop- 
pings warmed by the sun, I, too, ventured abroad. 
One day, wandering as far as the Arched Eock, I found 
the surgeon there, and together we sat down to rest 
under the trees, looking off over the blue water flecked 
with white caps. The Arch is a natural bridge over a 
chasm one hundred and fifty feet above the lake, a 
fissure in the cliff which has fallen away in a hollow, 
leaving the bridge by itself far out over the water. 
This bridge springs upward in the shape of an arch ; it 
is fifty feet long, and its width is in some places two 
feet, in others only a few inches, a narrow, dizzy 
pathway hanging between sky and water. 
 
"People have crossed it," I said. 
" Only fools," answered our surgeon, who despised 
foolhardiness. " Has a man nothing better to do with 
his life than risk it for the sake of a silly feat like 
that ? I would not so much as raise my eyes to see 
any one cross." 
" yes, you would, Monsieur Eodenai," cried a voice 
behind us. We both turned and caught a glimpse of 
i Jeannette as she bounded through the bushes and out 
to the very centre of the Arch, where she stood balan- 
cing herself and laughing gayly. Her form was outlined 
against the sky ; the breeze swayed her skirt ; she 
seemed hovering over the chasm. I watched her, mute 
with fear ; a word might cause her to lose her balance ; 
but I could not turn my eyes away, I was fascinated 
with the sight. I was not aware that Eodney had left 
me until he, too, appeared on the Arch, slowly finding 
a foothold for himself and advancing toward the centre. 
A fragment of the rock broke off under his foot and fell 
into the abyss below. 
" Go back, Monsieur Eodenai," cried Jeannette, see- 
ing his danger. 
" Will you come back too, Jeannette ? " 
"Moi? C'est auf chose" answered the girl, gayly 
tossing her pretty head. 
" Then I shall come out and carry you back, wilful 
child," said the surgeon. 
A peal of laughter broke from Jeannette as he spoke, 
 
and then she began to dance on her point of rock, 
swinging herself from side to side, marking the time 
with a song. I held my breath; her dance seemed 
unearthly ; it was as though she belonged to the Prince 
of the Powers of the Air. 
At length the surgeon reached the centre and caught 
the mocking creature in his arms : neither spoke, but 
I could see the flash of their eyes as they stood for 
an instant motionless. Then they struggled on the 
narrow foothold and swayed over so far that T buried 
my face in my trembling hands, unable to look at the 
dreadful end. When I opened my eyes again all was 
still; the Arch was tenantless, and no sound came 
from below. Were they, then, so soon dead ? With- 
out a cry ? I forced myself to the brink to look down 
over the precipice ; but while I stood there, fearing to 
look, I heard a sound behind me in the woods. It was 
Jeannette singing a gay French song. I called to her 
to stop. " How could you ? " I said severely, for I was 
still trembling with agitation. 
" Ce riest rien, madame. I cross l'Arche when I had 
five year. Mais, Monsieur Eodenai le Grand, he raise 
his eye to look this time, I think," said Jeannette, 
laughing triumphantly. 
" Where is he ? " 
"On the far side, gone on to Scott's Pic [Peak]. 
Ffroce, f&roce, comme un loupgarou ! Ah ! c'est joli, 
fa ! " And, overflowing with the wildest glee, the girl 
 
danced along through the woods in front of ine, now
