It was pitiful to see such weakness. He had never 
known his father to be really ill, and to have him lie an 
hour at a time pallid and not even moving his hand, to 
hear him speak a few words feebly, or leave off in the 
midst of a sentence as if he had no strength for the next 
word, made the case seem absolutely hopeless yet to him. 
And when the nurse fed him and he resigned himself to 
the ministrations without even a sigh, Sherburne was 
inexpressibly shocked. He had seen some cases of utter 
helplessness in the hospitals that were considered incur- 
able ; what if this should be paralysis in some insidious 
form ? 

"Do you truly think he will recover?" he asked, 
earnestly, of Doctor Underwood one morning. " He 
doesn't seem to make any improvement." 

"Yes, he has made a great deal," with a kindly, en- 
couraging smile. " You are hardly old enough in the 
business to have medical eyes that can detect the slight 
alterations. He was very ill, and he no longer has youth 
on his side, though he has a fine constitution. Look at 
Mr. and Mrs. Beaumanoir at their time of life ! We are 
proud enough of them. But your father has developed 
a good deal of heart weakness and no one can hurry 
that. Are you anxious to get back to your studies? 
Are you deeply interested, Sherburne? " 





" I like some aspects of medicine. No, I can't say 
that I am deeply interested." 

" A man's whole soul ought to be in his profession. I 
felt sorry you could not consider it the right thing to fol- 
low your father's wishes. And now he will need a son 
more than ever whose interests would lie in the same di- 
rection. Thank heaven I shall have a boy who will fol- 
low in my footsteps. I can see the bent of his mind al- 
ready. Don't be discouraged. Your father will come 
out all right. Indeed it is a great advantage to both of 
us that he should not worry about anything." 

Sherburne, left quite alone, glanced out of the win- 
dow. It was a glorious April morning. In less than a 
week spring had burst into wonderful growth and loveli- 
ness. All the air was sweet, and one could have the 
windows open. New life was rejoicing everywhere, in 
the fragrant breeze, in the song of birds, in the new 
leaves, the woodland bloom. 

"A son whose interests would lie in the same direc- 
tion." His uncle's words seemed to linger in the very 
air, and to smite him with a feeling he could not analyze 
on the instant. Then he glanced at the pale, still face, 
fine, handsome and noble, in spite of the lines of ill- 
ness. 

What a long holiday his twenty years had been ! 
There was great rejoicing over his birth, and he had been 
named for his great uncle who had died in youth away from 
home. This splendid old Sherburne House was to be his 
some day, it had been a grand gift of Aunt Lyndell. 
His boyhood had been full of love and pleasure, his 
school-days bright with study, games, fun and a long de- 
lightsome vacation every summer with the most gladsome 
of home joys and love and indulgence on every side. 





He had taken his own way in entering a German univer- 
sity, and then he had changed his mind, why he hardly 
knew, except that he had an overwhelming fancy to re- 
main in New York.
