an almost tigerish desire to call her mine once more. 
I have been tempted to rush to the very extent of the 
law and compel her to fulfil her first vows. So much 
for my feelings on that score, which I take it is pretty 
near love. A higher motive has urged me to wait. If 
she comes to me of her own free will, I shall forget 
the past — " 

"In consideration of the fortune, perhaps. Would 
you be as generous to a woman with no fortune?" the 
lawyer asked dryly. 

"That would be entirely my own affair. She has a 
fortune, which is your chief concern at present. We 
have made an agreement — for a month she is to remain 
in seclusion, and most kindly gives me the privilege of 



visiting her. If. during that time, I succeed in making 
a favorable impression, and Mr. Tremaine evinces a 
disinclination to renewttieir former relations — for that 
may influence her — the matter may be amicably set- 
tled. I see no reason why I should not use my best 
endeavors, since I find that I do care for her." 

Jasper Cameron announced this with great apparent 
honesty. Colby realized, turn whichever way he might, 
that he was still in the man's grasp. 

"Suppose she should decide even then not to return 
to you?" 

" If I fail to gain her own free consent, I shall give 
her up. I am not so much of a villain as you think. 
But in that case I shall see every penny of her fortune 
restored to her just the same. You proposed trusting 
to her generosity — why should not I ? If she does 
not care to accept me for her husband, she would give 
a good deal for legal liberty. I could easily place it in 
her way, you know ! " 

Yes, the man was hemmed in on every side. Ruin 
stared him in the face. 

" So I give you a month's grace, which js more than 
every one would do, granting that you do not mean to 
flit in the meanwhile. Matters may look brighter for 
you then." 

That was with Jasper Cameron's old, gay assurance. 

For an instant a wild idea entered Colby's brain. 
Suppose he took what he had and sought some other 



clime ? But there was the infamy to be cast upon his 
dear, innocent children — no, he could not endure that 
they should dl rise up and ha^ him. 

" You said the last time you were here that she knew 
nothing of the fortune ? " • 

"Very-true. She does not." 

" I think she will feel that the fortune was her great 
attraction in your eyes." 

"Well, I mean that she shall have it in any case," 
Cameron returned with a kind of dogged pertinacity. 

" Then you have given up an idea that you advanced 
in our other talk on this subject?" 

Drops of perspiration started out on Colby's pallid . 
brow, and he uttered the words rather huskily. He 
had been brooding over the temptation daily, and now 
to have it taken out of his way, seemed an actual loss. 
He was not sharp enough to guess that Jasper Cameron
