Sandy took his son's arm, and they went off together. Daffodil looked
after them with long breaths that almost brought tears to her eyes.
Grandad hadn't been glad when the news came; she could see just how he
had turned with his nose in the air, and now he was claiming his son
as if he had all the right.

Gran'mere was concocting some mystery on the kitchen table, Barbe sat
at the little wheel, spinning. And she was singing, too. A faint pink
had come back to her cheek, and her eyes almost laughed with delight.

     "What's a' the steer, kimmer.
     What's a' the steer,
     Jamie has landed, and soon he will be here."

She had a soft sweet voice. How long since she had sung with that
gayety. True, she had been ill, and now she was well again, and Jamie
had come home. But grandad had taken him off, and that somehow rankled
in the child's heart.

She stood by the window, uncertainly. There were only two small
windows in the large room that were of glass, for glass was costly.
Another much larger had board shutters, closed tightly, and a blanket
hung over it to keep out the cold. They called it the summer window.
One looked over to the other house and Daffodil was there.

"I wouldn't go over if I were you," said her mother. "It is very wet.
Grandad might have carried you, but he hardly knows whether he's on
his head or his heels."

"He'd look very funny on his head. What makes him so glad? He was
angry about--if that great general hadn't--I can't say the long word,
father couldn't have come home."

She turned a very puzzled face to her mother.

"There might have been a big battle;" and the mother shuddered. "Oh,
grandad will be as glad as the rest of us presently that we have a
country. Now we can begin to live."

It was all very strange to her small mind. The sun was making rivulets
through the snow, and the great white unbroken sheets sparkled with
iridescent lights. Out beyond there was the Fort; she could see
figures moving to and fro. Everything seemed so strange to her. And a
country of one's own! Would the farms be larger, and, if England was
beaten, what would become of it? Would they, our people, go over and
take what they wanted? Would they drive the people away as they did
the Indians?

She was tired of so much thinking. She went over to grandfather, and
seated herself on the arm of the chair. She did not want Norry's fairy
stories. Leaning her head down on the dear old shoulder, she said,
"Tell me about a great King, who beat the English."

"Are you going mad about the English?" her mother asked laughingly.
"We shall all be friends again. Quarrels are made up. And so many of
us came from England."

"We didn't," returned Dilly decisively.

"Well--on the one side Scotch and Irish."

"And on the other French, pure French, until your mother married a
Bradin, and you----"

"And Marc Bradin has been a good husband to me," said his wife,
looking up from her preparations.

Truly, he had, and a kind son to him as well, though he had not been
in favor of the marriage at first.

The story was about the grand old times in France. He never told of
the religious persecutions to the little girl. He had a soft winsome
sort of voice, and often lapsed into French idioms, but she was
always charmed with it, even if she could not understand all he said.
Presently she went fast asleep.

Then the darkness began to fall. The candles were lighted, and that
roused both sleepers. There was a savory smell of supper, even Judy
went around sniffing.
