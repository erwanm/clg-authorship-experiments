perched on a low embankment, communicating with 
the beach at two or three points by a short flight of 
steps. Bernard saw — or supposed he saw — that 
she was asking herself whither she had best turn to 
avoid him. He had not blushed when she looked at 
him — he had rather turned a little pale ; but he 
blushed now, for it really seemed odious to have 
literally driven the poor girl to bay. Miss Vivian 
decided to take refuge in the Casino, and she passed 





along one of the little pathways of planks that were 
laid here and there across the beach, and directed her- 
self to the nearest flight of steps. Before she had 
gone two paces a complete change came over Ber- 
nard's feeling ; his only wish now was to speak to 
hsr — to explain — to tell her he would go away. 
There was another row of steps at a short distance 
behind him ; he rapidly ascended them and reached 
the little terrace of the Casino. Miss Vivian stood 
there; she was apparently hesitating again which 
way to turn. Bernard came straight up to her, with 
a gallant smile and a greeting. The comparison is a 
coarse one, but he felt that he was taking the bull by 
the horns. Angela Vivian stood watching him arrive. 

" You didn' t recognize me," he said, " and your 
not recognizing me made me — made me hesitate." 

For a moment she said nothing, and then — 

" You are more timid than you used to be ! " she 
answered. 

He could hardly have said what expression he had 
expected to find in her face ; his apprehension had, 
perhaps, not painted her obtrusively pale and haughty, 
aggressively cold and stern ; but it had figured some- 
thing different from the look he encountered. Miss 
Vivian was simply blushing — that was what Bernard 
mainly perceived ; he saw that her surprise had been 
extreme — complete. Her blush was re-assuring ; it 
contradicted the idea of impatient resentment, and 





Bernard took some satisfaction in noting that it was 
prolonged. 

" Yes, I am more timid than I used to be," he said. 

In spite of her blush, she continued to look at him 
very directly; but she had always done that — she 
always met one's eye; and Bernard now instantly 
found all the beauty that he had ever found before 
in her pure, unevasive glance. 

"I don't know' whether I am more brave," she 
said ; " but I must tell the truth — I instantly rec- 
ognized you." * 

" You gave no sign ! " 

" I supposed I gave a striking one — in getting up 
and going away." 

" Ah ! " said Bernard, " as I say, I am more timid 
than I was, and I didn' t venture to interpret that as 
a sign of recognition." 

" It was a sign of surprise." 

" Not of pleasure ! " said Bernard. He felt this to 
be a venturesome, and from the point of view of taste 
perhaps a reprehensible, remark ; but he made it be-
