He walked into the house, according to custom, the 
kitchen a lovely place in its conventional order, and 
through to the sitting-room. There he halted in the 
doorway, not only to give decent greeting but to laugh 
within himself at the significant picture. Sally Wheeler 
had come to make a call. That was the little group pre- 
sented: Sally, upright, more disordered in her dress than 
Herrick's maiden but yet so patently a gentlewoman, 
Clara, eager, ingratiating, because, though she knew 
Sally Wheeler as she did the old lilac bushes in her front 
yard, it was an honor to receive a call from her, and Abial 
holding his head higher and essaying the English he 
would use at the Capital. When Larry, not very scrupu- 
lous of costume, for he had had a disordering day, ap- 
peared at the door, cap in hand, they looked up at him 
and Sally Wheeler's face flickered slightly, as if a smile 
had started and she forbade it. But Abial and Clara were 
distinctly annoyed, he with a sense of the unfit and even 
dangerous, and she in a tolerant way, judging that Larry 
was so odd, so droll she called him in her really admiring 
moments, that you could never know where social inter-i 
course would get if he took the reins into his hands. 



 

Larry sat down at once. He wasn't sure of being asked, 
and Abial looked at him unwinkingly and tried to frown 
him into decency. 

" I'm on my rounds, you see," said Sally Wheeler, 
" collecting. Old linen, clothes, a little of everything — 
but chiefly money. Whatever I don't get, money I must 
have." 

" You couldn't have come to a better place," said Larry. 
" Abial's the soul of liberality. 'Bial, I believe you've 
got all the family virtues as well as the family cash. 
You're like the old Greene in Revolutionary times. Do 
you remember, Sally? I showed you those entries in the 
town accounts. How he took on himself the expenses of 
the town poor for that year — no, it was for three years 
— and handed over his cash-box besides, and came out of 
the war broke and couldn't buy himself shoes to go to 
Washington. But they would have sent him, all the same, 
if he had lived." 

" Yes," said Sally Wheeler, " they'd have sent him. 
He was a great patriot. I don't wonder you're so proud 
of him." 

Abial's face had flushed slightly. It was not from 
emotional warmth so much as the physical response to 
praise. 

" That's a different matter," said he. " 'Twas our 
own war, when all's said an' done." 

Sally Wheeler leaped to the argument. 

" Ah, but this is your own war, too, Abial. This is a 
chance to show what a big American can do. Morgan — 
J. P. Morgan, you know — was ready at the start to fur- 
nish cash. He wasn't allowed, I understand; but it 
never'll be forgotten of him. These things are not for- 
gotten." 

" 'Bial knows that," said Larry slowly. He looked at 



 

his feet and pondered. It was true that Abial was the 
only thing he had to give ; but how could he make Abial 
see it? "I wrote it out last night, 'Bial," said he, rais- 
ing his eyes and looking at his brother, " the story I told 
you. It's the story of father's money and the story of 
the lot. And then I said to myself I'd wait a day. And
