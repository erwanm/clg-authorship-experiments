he felt no loss, I mean; that he could transfer sO 
readily feelings which it seems to me ought to be 
immoveable and inalienable, from one to another. 
Altogether, I have not been just happy since I came 
home. But this is sheer naughtiness and want of 
faith, and looking at second causes, which is great 
folly. I have striven and fought against it, and 
prayed. Nevertheless I have not got back my 
healthy energies yet. I do my work with a faint 
heart; things that used to be pleasant and ought 
to be pleasant, have lost their savour somehow. I 
am so sorry to dishonour my Master in this way ! 
I do not mean that anybody sees it; outwardly, I 
guess, I am the same as usual; but he sees it; and 
that he should spy doubt of him, or unwillingness 
to accept his arrangements, in my heart, is a great 
grief to me. And such regrets and such slack-heart- 
edness as I have felt, in reality can come from noth 
ing else,where the physical condition is not in fault. 
The roses and honeysuckle are blooming again. 
The scents of them come all round me as I write; 
and another scent, from the hay fields, faint and 
sweet and pure. it is long ago to that summer 
when the letter came from Mr. Iredell. The roses 
and honeysuckle were in blossom then. Nature 
does not change. And 0, Desire Burgoyne, God 
does not change. The roses are not so sweet as 
the breath of his love, which is always about you, 
and knows no winter of intermission ; and the return of the roses is not more certain than the constancy of his kindness. 



 

I have a strange feeling of missing Olive's letters. 
They were not frequent, ever; but now and then 
they came, and they kept up a connection, distant 
enough but real, with a world outside of Chester 
field and with something in that world that I liked 
to hear of. Caroline's letters never touch it. I feel 
more alone than I used to do. Well. When one 
of the Lord's children is suffered to feel lonely, that 
means that he is to seek his home more utterly in 
God. " Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in 
all generations." Yes, I am content. 

I brought away my little properties from Philadelphia with me ; my St. Cecilia, my Black Brunswicker, and my St. Mark's Kest; but I have left 
them packed up as I brought them. One day, perhaps, I may take them out and enjoy them; but 
the time is not now. 



 April 1. 

NINE months, almost, since my last entry; and 
spring finds me with Mrs. Bowdoin. The 
winter was very busy and peaceful; looking back 
at my last writing I am ashamed of it; but I let 
it stand. It is good to know oneself. The winter 
was very peaceful, but there w r as a great deal old
sickness in the valley, and I had a great deal of 
nursing to do. I believe the first thing that really 
cured me of my morbid mental condition was the 
being forced out of myself and my own affairs by 



 

the needs of other people. Then Mrs. Bowdoin 
sent for me to take a trip to the South with her; 
she was going to Washington, and perhaps to Florida. I came two weeks ago, and found her not 
well enough to set out; and instead of growing 
better she has grown worse. So here I am in 
stalled as nurse again; and for the present with 
plenty to do; for Mrs. Bowdoin^is a sick woman. 
The doctor fears typhoid fever.
