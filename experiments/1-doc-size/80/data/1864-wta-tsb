"Will you surrender?" demanded Tom, as he thrust vigorously with his
bayonet.

"We surrender," replied one of the men; but it was not the one who had
spoken before, for he had dropped off his seat upon the bottom of the
boat.

"Give up your pistols, then," added Hapgood. "You look out for the boat,
Tom, and I will take care of these fellows."

Tom sprang to the position which had been occupied by the spokesman of the
party, and grasping the foresheet and the tiller of the boat, he soon
brought her up to the wind. Seating himself in the stern, he assumed the
management of the schooner, while Hapgood busied himself in taking the
pistols from the hands of the rebels, and exploring their pockets, in
search of other dangerous weapons.

"How are you, Fred?" shouted Tom, when the pressing business of the moment
had been disposed of. "Are you much hurt?"

"I'm afraid my time's most up," replied he, faintly.

"Where are you hit?"

"In the face; the ball went through my head, I suppose," he added, in
tones that were hardly audible, in the warring of the December blast.

"Keep up a good heart, Fred, and we will soon be ashore. Have you got an
easy place?"

"No, the water dashes over me."

"Can't you move him aft, Hapgood?"

"Pretty soon; when I get these fellows fixed," replied the veteran, who
had cut the rope nearest to his hands, and was securing the arms of the
prisoners behind them.

"There is no fear of them now. We have got two revolvers apiece, and we can
have it all our own way, if they show fight."

But Hapgood had bound the rebels by this time, and with tender care he
lifted his wounded companion down into the standing room, and made him as
comfortable as the circumstances would permit.

"Now, where are we, Hapgood?" asked Tom, who had been vainly peering ahead
to discover some familiar object by which to steer. I can't see the first
thing."

"I don't know where we are," replied Hapgood. "I never was much of a
sailor, and I leave the navigating all to you."

"I can navigate well enough, if I knew where we were," added Tom, who had
thus far been utterly unable to ascertain the "ship's position."

During the brief struggle for the possession of the schooner, she had
drifted some distance, which had caused the new commander to lose his
bearings. The shore they had just left had disappeared, as though it had
been swallowed up by an earthquake. No lights were allowed on shore, where
they could be seen from the river, for they afforded so many targets to
the artillerymen in the rebel batteries. The more Tom tried to discover a
familiar object to steer by, the more it seemed as though the land and
everything else had been cut adrift, and emigrated to foreign parts. Those
who have been in a boat in a very dark night, or in a dense fog, will be
able to appreciate the bewilderment of the skipper of the captured
schooner.

"Look out, Tom, that you don't run us into some of those rebel batteries,"
said Hapgood, after he had watched the rapid progress of the boat for a
few moments. "A shot from a thirty-two pounder would be a pill we couldn't
swallow."

"No danger of that, Hapgood," answered Tom, confidently.

"I don't know about that, my boy," answered the veteran, in a tone heavy
with dire anxiety.

"I know it. The schooner was running with the wind on her starboard
quarter when we boarded her. We are now close-hauled, and of course we
