Something in Stephen Dane's mien and tones filled 
them all with involuntary respect and admiration. 
McKinstry thought of his three sturdy boys growing 
up, and wondered if one of them would treat his white 
hairs with such filial tenderness. 

" Out o' the river, Stephen. All white, and dread- 
ful ! " 

Stephen Dane drew a long breath of dismay. 
Adams stood looking on. What if, at this height, he 
was to be hurled back into degradation ! He turned 
blindly. He lifted the trembling, cowering figure, 
shaking as if an ague fit had seized him. 

"My carriage is there in the yard," said Disbrow. 
" I insist upon your taking it, Dane. Here, let me 
call my man." 

Stephen carried him out, stopping the betraying 
mouth with kisses. He had never offered such a caress 
before, but he was in a great bound of agony now. 
The lips were soft as a child's, the breath no longer 
polluted with rum and tobacco. 

At last they were safe. The carriage door closed 
with a sharp click. The driver there on the front seat 
would never translate this pitiful moan 

" Out o' the river, Stephen ! " 

He carried his father through the room, and laid him 
on the bed, making a brief explanation to Joe. Then 



 

he administered a composing draught, and watched 
until drowsiness intervened. Archy Dane still twitched

eyes were but half closed, the white frightfully visible 
in contrast with his sunken, withered cheeks. 

"Is he going to be sick?" Joe asked, in a low tone, 
as Stephen sat down to the supper table. 

M I don't know. Something frightened him, I 
think." 

"He looks dreadfully as if he might die. I've' 
never seen anybody die, Stephen ; " and Joe shivered. 

" Don't think of it now." 

Stephen was glad that Joe slept up stairs. For all 
night his father gave fitful starts, and cried out with 
dim remembrances of the fatal deed that was bearing 
heavily upon him again. The son watched him, and 
thought, wildly and agonizingly enough at times. All 
day a sort of chill presentiment had hung over him. 
Perhaps because it was nearing this fatal season. 

He had hoped that memory would never return to his 
father. If life could go out quietly may be there was 
some mercy with God, that man knew not of. lie 
could see the weakness, the temptation, the unguarded 
moment ; and He was pity, as well as justice. 

The long night wore away; for long it seemed, al- 
though at midsummer. The stars softened and died 
out ; there were faint opal streaks coming up in the east, 
and a quiver of soft gray light. He extinguished the 



 

lamp and opened the blinds. A fragrant breath from 
distant river and meadow-land fluttered into the great
