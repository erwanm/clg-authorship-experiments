peace, rest. I am not ungrateful, nor ruled by any 
mean, sullen spirit. Heaven knows I ought to have 
done with all such now. And I take my share of your 
love gladly." 

" Which must be all, Joe. Let me make amends for 
the past, wherein I have made you suffer. Until God 
separates us " 

She guessed what he would have said, for her wo- 
man's intuition had been quickened. She placed her 
hand gently over his lips. 

" No, Stephen. Hope's place must be kept sacred, 
if she never comes to fill it. But she will. And hav- 
ing your love, I am content." 

" You don't quite understand it," he said, gently. 
" When I told my love, I did not dare repeat the story. 
I had a misgiving of the shock it would cause her. 
God did not mean that she should be mine." 

" We don't know what God means until it comes. 
We have only to wait. I told you before that I could 



 

not fill your heart, and a name was nothing. But you 
are princely generous, Stephen." 

"Will you take the gift?" 

"No," softly and tearfully. "Only love me to the 
end." 

They clasped hands in the silence, coming nearer to 
each other then than ever before in their whole lives. 
And both hearts yearned for the absent one. 

Far into the night Stephen Dane sat and watched his 
cousin. When the wind died down he fanned her 
gently, and with tenderest hands put aside the heavy 
hair clustering about her temples. Poor Joe, how hard 
life had been with her ! 

The next day Stephen consulted an eminent physi- 
cian. It was, as he had feared, too late for recovery. 
But Joe no longer cared for life. 

The shock and her remorse made fearful inroads upon 
her enfeebled frame. She amended a little, so that she 
came down stairs, and walked about the garden. Every 
day Stephen took her to drive. Such lovely haunts as 
he found, full of the later summer's greenery and fra- 
grance ! Rambles through quiet lanes, or by the wind- 
ing river ; tender talks, for there was nothing withheld 
now. It seemed to Joe as if she was entering heaven 
almost before her time. 

As the days wore on, an odd wish came to her. She 
wanted to see the clergyman who had read the funeral 
service that had so deeply impressed her. Stephen 



 

found him easily a Mr. Leighton, a stranger in the 
place, who had been at his post barely two months. 

A very curious mood took possession of Joe on this 
afternoon. She begged Katy to braid her hair as 
Hope used, and wreathe stems of Madeira blossoms in 
it. Her snowy wrapper was as faultless as Katy's 
fond care could make it, and the loving heart insisted 
upon her being adorned with a knot of scarlet ribbon 
at her throat "Jest as dear Miss Hope used to 
fix it."
