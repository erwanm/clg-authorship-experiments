“Ten thousand dollars!” Adding, after a con- 
siderable pause: 

“ Ten thousand. It is a heap of money.” 

Presently the poet enquired: 

“Are you going to send it to him right away? ” 
“Yes,” I said. “ It is a queer question.” 

No reply. After a little, Rogers asked hesitatingly 

“All of it? That is — I mean ” 

“ Certainly , all of it.” 

I was going to say more, but stopped — was stopped 
by a train of thought which started up in me. Thorxip , 
son spoke, but my mind was absent and I did not cat. h 
what he said. But I heard Rogers answer: 

“Yet, it seems so to me. It ought to be quite 
sufficient; for I don’t see that he has done anything.’” 

Presently the poet said : 

“When you come to look at it , it is more than 
sufficient. Just look at it — five thousand dollars! 
Why, he couldn't spend it in a lifetime! And it 
would injure him, too; perhaps ruiu him — you want 
to look at that In a little, while he would throw his 
last away, shut up his shop, maybe take to drinking, 
maltreat his motherless children, drift into other evil 
-courses, go steadily from bad to worse * ’ 

“ Yes, that’s it,” interrupted Rogers fervently, “ I’ve 
seen it a hundred times — yes, more than a hundred. 
You put money -into the hands of a man like that, if 
you want to destroy him, that’s all. Just put money 
into his hands, it’s all you’ve got to do; and if it don't 
pull him down, and take all the usefulness out of him, 
and all the self-respect and everything, then I don’t 
know human nature — ain’t that so, Thompson? And 
even if we were to give him a third of it; why, in less 
than six months ” 

“Less than six weeks , you’d better say! ” said I, 
warming up and breaking in. “Unless he had that 
three thousand dollars in safe hands where he couldn’t 
touch it, he would no more last you six weeks 
than ” 

“ Of course he wouldn’t ! “ said Thompson. “ I’ve 
edited books for that kind of people: and the moment 
they get their hands on the royalty — maybe it’s 
three thousand, maybe it’s two thousand ” 

“ What business has that shoemaker with two thorn 
sand dollars, I should like to know? ” broke in Rogers 
earnestly, “A man perhaps perfectly contented now, 
there in Mannheim, surrounded by his own class, eat- 
ing his bread with the appetite which laborious industry 
alone can give, enjoying his humble life, honest, up- 
right, pure in heart, and blest l — yes, I say blest! 
above all the myriads that go in silk attire and walk the 
empty, artificial Kound of social folly — but just you 
put that temptation before him once ! j’ust you lay 
fifteen hundred dollars before a man like that, and 
say ” 

“ Fifteen hundred devils ! ” cried I. “Five hundred 
would rot bis principles, paralyze his industry, drag 
him to the rumshop, thence to the gutter, thence to 
the almshouse, thence to ” 

“ Why put upon ourselves this crime, gentlemen ?” 
interrupted the poet earnestly and appealingly. “ He 
is happy where he is, and as he is. Every sentiment 
of honor, every sentiment of charity, every sentiment
