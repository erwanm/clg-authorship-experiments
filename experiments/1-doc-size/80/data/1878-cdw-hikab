he struck a tremendous pace through the water. It 
would be false modesty in a sportsman to say that I 
was not equal to the occasion. Instead of turning 
round vdth him, as he expected, I stepped to the bow, 
braced myself, and let the boat swing. Eound went 
the fish, and round we went like a top. I saw a line 
of Mount Marcys all round the horizon ; the rosy tint 
in the west made a broad band of pink along the sky 
above the tree-tops ; the evening star was a perfect 
circle of light, a hoop of gold in the heavens. We 
whirled and reeled, and reeled and whirled. I was 
willing to give the malicious beast butt and line, and 
all, if he would only go the other way for a change. 

When I came to myself, Luke was gaffing the trout 
at the boat-side. After we had got him in and dressed 
him, he weighed three-quarters of a pound. Fish 
always lose by being " got in and dressed." It is best 
to weigh them while they are in the water. The only 
really large one I ever caught got away with my 
leader when I first struck him. He weighed ten pounds. 



A-HUNTING OF THE DEER 



If civilization owes a debt of gratitude to the self- 
sacrificing sportsmen who have cleared the Adiron- 
dack regions of catamounts and savage trout, what 
shall be said of the army which has so nobly relieved 
them of the terror of the deer ? The deer-slayers have 
somewhat celebrated their exploits in print ; but I 
think that justice has never been done them. 

The American deer in the wilderness, left to him- 
self, leads a comparatively harmless but rather stupid 
life, with only such excitement as his own timid 
fancy raises. It was very seldom that one of his tribe 
was eaten by the North American tiger. For a wild 
animal he is very domestic, simple in his tastes, reg- 
ular in his habits, affectionate in his family. Unfor- 
tunately for his^ repose, his haunch is as tender as 
his heart. Of all wild creatures he is one of the 
most graceful in action, and he poses with the skill 
of an experienced model. I have seen the goats on 
Mount Pentelicus scatter at the approach of a stran- 
ger, climb to the sharp points of projecting rocks, and 
attitudinize in the most self-conscious manner, strik- 
ing at once those picturesque postures against the sky 
with which Oriental pictures have made us and them 
familiar. But the whole proceeding was theatrical. 
Greece is the home of art, and it is rare to find any- 
thing there natural and unstudied. I presume that 



A'-HUNTING OF THE DEER 

these goats have no nonsense about them when they 
are alone with the goat-herds, any more than the goat- 
herds have, except when they come to pose in the stu- 
dio ; but the long ages of culture, the presence always 
to the eye oÂ£ the best models and the forms of im- 
mortal beauty, the heroic friezes of the Temple of 
Theseus, the marble processions of sacrificial animals, 
have had a steady moulding, educating influence 
equal to a society of decorative art upon the people 
and the animals who have dwelt in this artistic atmos- 
phere. The Attic goat has become an artificially ar- 
tistic being ; though of course he is not now what he 
was, as a poser, in the days of Polycletus. There is 
opportunity for a very instructive essay by Mr. E. A. 
Freeman on the decadence of the Attic goat imder 
the influence of the Ottoman Turk. 

The American deer, in the free atmosphere of our 
country, and as yet untouched by our decorative art, 
is without self-consciousness, and all his attitudes are
