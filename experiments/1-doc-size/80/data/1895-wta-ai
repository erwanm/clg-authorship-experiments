Professor Giroud, and then by the three distinguished guests from the
Travancore.

The general replied to all of them at the close of the entertainment. He
was a pleasant speaker, and his handsome face added a great deal to his
words. The affair was declared to be a great success for a dinner-party at
sea, and the commander of the Guardian-Mother invited all their hosts to
assist him in a similar one on board his ship, the signal for which was to
be the American Union Jack when the weather was suitable.

The party returned to their ocean home; and the commander spent the rest of
the evening in telling his guests the story of General Noury, and
especially of his wonderful reformation.

"Then Captain Sharp really saved his life?" added Lord Tremlyn.

"No doubt of it. The two ruffians in a street of Messina had disabled the
general, and would certainly have finished him if the captain had not
wounded one with his revolver, and tackled the other. He owes his life to
Sharp without a doubt. Mrs. Sharp took care of him for quite a time while
he was recovering from his wound, and she made a deep impression upon him.
He is a Mohammedan, and he sticks to his religion; but even that is capable
of making a better man of him than he was before."

"I was much pleased with Mrs. Sharp, not because she is an English woman,
but because she is a very worthy person," added his lordship.

"You are quite right, my lord, and she has had a romantic history;" and
before they retired he had told the whole of it.

At the usual time the next day the company were assembled in Conference
Hall; and when the commander announced that Lord Tremlyn would address them
on the general subject, "The People of India," they manifested their
interest by a liberal salvo of applause.




                                 CHAPTER XII

                      THE POPULATION AND PEOPLE OF INDIA


"Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to appear before you, and to look you all
in the face," his lordship began as the applause subsided. "The task befaw
me is to put a gallon of fluid into a pint pot. It cawn't be done. I shall
not attempt to do what is quite impossible. I can only put in what the
vessel will hold. I cawn't say all there is to be said about the people of
India in an hour, or even two or three hours."

The noble gentleman was an easy, pleasant, and fluent speaker, evidently
quite accustomed to addressing public assemblies; but he had certain
peculiarities of speech, a very few of them, which sounded just a little
odd to the Americans, as doubtless some of their pronunciation did to the
Britons. But there is hardly a perceptible difference in the pronunciation
of highly trained speakers of one nation and the other. It is not necessary
to indicate any farther the slightly peculiar speech of the accomplished
gentleman.

"I can only select from the mass of material before me what I think will be
most interesting and useful to you; for I have been warned that I must not
talk all day," continued the viscount.

"We leave that to your lordship's own judgment," added Captain Ringgold.

"I will be merciful, Mr. Commander: as merciful as possible. Next to China,
India is the most populous country on the globe; and without Nepaul, it
numbered, in 1891, 287,223,917, or more than one-seventh of the people on
the face of the earth; and the increase in the last decade was almost
28,000,000,--enough to populate about a dozen of your larger States.

"In spite of its vast population, India cannot be said to be a very densely
peopled region; 184 to the square mile for the whole country. The mountain
territory is quite thinly settled. All the native states have but 108 to
the square mile, though the plains of the Ganges show about 400. About
Benares and Patna the average is about double these figures. I was looking
at the 'Year-Book' in your library, and I saw that the average in the
States, including Alaska, is about 18 to the square mile; but the nine
States in the north-east have 107.
