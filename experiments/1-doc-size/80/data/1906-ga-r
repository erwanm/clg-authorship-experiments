from the beach, was a quadrangle of buildings 
some two hundred feet square and surrounded 
by a wall about fourteen feet high and seven 
feet thick. This they knew to be the Presidio. 
They saw the officers that had hailed them gallop 
over the hill behind the fort to the more ambitious 

enclosure and, in the square, confer with another 
group that seemed to be in a corresponding state 
of excitement. A few moments later a deputation 
of officers, accompanied by a priest in the 
brown habit of the Franciscan order, started on 
horseback for the beach. Rezanov ordered Lieutenant
Davidov and Dr. Langsdorff to the shore 
as his representatives. 

The Spaniards wore the undress uniform of 
black and scarlet in which they had been surprised, 
but their peaked straw hats were deco- 
rated with cords of gold or silver, the tassels 
hanging low on the broad brim; their high deer- 
skin boots were gayly embroidered, and bristled 
with immense silver spurs. The commanding officer 
alone had invested himself with a gala serape, 
a square of red cloth with a bound and embroidered 
slit for the head. Leading the rapid procession, 
his left hand rested significantly on his sword, 
he was a fine specimen of the young California 
grandee, dark and dashing and reckless, lithe of 
figure, thoroughbred, dissipated, and ardent. His 
eyes were sparkling at the prospect of excitement ;
not only had the Eussians, by their nefarious 
appropriation of the northwestern corner of 
the continent and a recent piratical excursion in 



 

pursuit of otter, inspired the Spanish Government 
with a profound disapproval and mistrust, 
hut a rumor had run up the coast that made 
every sea-gull look like the herald of a hostile 
fleet. This was young Argiiello's first taste of 
command, and life was dull on the northern peninsula;
he would have welcomed a declaration of 
war. 

Davidov and Langsdorif had come to shore in 
one of the Juno's canoes. The conversation was 
held in Latin between the two men of learning. 

" Who are you and whence come you? " asked 
the priest. 

Langsdorff, who had been severely drilled by 
the plenipotentiary as to text, replied with a 
profound bow: " We are Eussians engaged in 
completing the circumnavigation of the globe. 
It was our intention to go directly to Monterey 
and present our official documents as well as our 
respects, to your illustrious Governor, but owing 
to contrary winds and a resultant scarcity of 
provisions, we were under the necessity of 
putting into the nearest harbor. The Juno is 
navigated by Lieutenant Davidov and Lieutenant 
Khovstov, of the Imperial Navy of Eussia; by 
gracious permission associated with the Marine 


of the Russo-American Company." He paused 
a moment and then swept out his trump card with 
a magnificent flourish: " Our expedition is in 
command of His Excellency, Privy Counsellor 
and Grand Chamberlain Baron Rezanov, late Ambassador 
to the Court of Japan, Plenipotentiary 
of the Russo-American Company, Imperial Inspector 
of the extreme eastern and northwest 
American dominions of His Imperial Majesty, 
Alexander the First, Emperor of all the Russias,
