journ, and I am now afraid he had some difficulty in 
keeping a head porter's conventional respect for a for- 
mal superior in answering that we had arrived on the 
eve of Doncaster Week. Then I said, " Oh yes," and 
affected the knowledge of Doncaster Week which I re- 
solved to acquire by staying somewhere in York till it 
was over. 

But as yet, that Friday afternoon, there was no hurry, 
and, instead of setting about a search for lodgings at 
once, we drove up into the town, as soon as we had tea, 
and visited York Minster while it was still the gray 
afternoon and not yet the gray evening. I thought the 
hour fortunate, and I do not see yet how we could have 
chosen a better hour out of the whole twenty-four, for 
the inside or the outside of the glorious fane, the grand- 
est and beautifulest in all England, as I felt then and 
I feel now. If I were put to the question and were 
forced to say in what its supreme grandeur and beauty 
lay, I should perhaps say in its most ample simplicity. 
N"o doubt it is full of detail, but I keep no sense of this 
from that mighty interior, with its tree-like, clustered 
pillars, and its measureless windows, like breadths of 
stained foliage in autumnal woodlands. You want the 
scale of nature for the Minster at York, and I can- 
not liken it to less than all-out-doors. Some cathedrals, 
like that of Wells, make you think of gardens; but 
York Minster will not be satisfied with less than an 
autumnal woodland, where the trees stand in clumps, 
with grassy levels about them, and with spacious open- 
ings to the sky, that let in the colored evening light. 

You could not get lost in it, for it was so free of 
all such architectural undergrowth as cumbers the per- 
spectives of some cathedrals; besides, the afternoon of 
  

our visit there were so many other Americans that you 
could easily have asked your way in your own dialect. 
We loitered over its lengths and breadths, and wondered 
at its windows, which were like the gates of sunrise 
and sunset for magnitude, and lingered in a sumptuous 
delay from going into the choir, delighting in the gray 
twilight which seemed to gather from the gray walls 
inward, when suddenly what seemed a metallic curtain 
was dropped with a clash and the simultaneous up- 
flashing of electric bulbs inside it, and we were shut 
out from the sight but not the sound of the service 
that began in the choir. We could not wholly regret 
the incident, for as we recalled the like operation of 
religion in churches of our Italian travel, we were re- 
minded how equally authoritative the Church of Eng- 
land and the Church of Rome were, and how little they 
adjust their ceremonial to the individual, how largely 
to the collective worshipper. You could come into the 
Minster of York as into the basilica of St. Mark at 
Venice for a silent prayer amid the religious influences 
of the place, and be conscious of your oneness with your 
Source, as if there were no other one ; but when the 
priesthood called you as one of many to your devotions, 
it was with the same imperative voice in both, and you 
must obey or be cut off from your chance. I suppose 
it is right ; but somehow the down - clashing of that 
screen of the choir in the Minster at York seemed 
to exclude us with reproach, almost with ignominy. 

We did what we could to repair our wounded self- 
respect, and did not lay our exclusion up against the 
Minster itself, which I find that I noted as " scatter- 
ingly noble outside.  ' By this I dare say I meant it 
had not that artistic unity of which I brought the im- 
pression from the inside. They were doing, as they 
were always doing, everywhere, with English cathedrals, 

 

something to one of the towers ; but this only enhanced 
its scattering nobleness, for it left that greatly bescaf- 
folded tower largely to the imagination, in which it 
soared sublimer, if anything, than its compeer. Most
