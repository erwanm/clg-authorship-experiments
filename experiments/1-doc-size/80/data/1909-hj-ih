which he shares for the most part with the Venetians at large. One
grows very fond of these people, and the reason of one’s fondness is the
frankness and sweetness of their address. That of the Italian family
at large has much to recommend it; but in the Venetian manner there is
something peculiarly ingratiating. One feels that the race is old, that
it has a long and rich civilisation in its blood, and that if it hasn’t
been blessed by fortune it has at least been polished by time. It hasn’t
a genius for stiff morality, and indeed makes few pretensions in that
direction. It scruples but scantly to represent the false as the
true, and has been accused of cultivating the occasion to grasp and
to overreach, and of steering a crooked course--not to your and my
advantage--amid the sanctities of property. It has been accused further
of loving if not too well at least too often, of being in fine as little
austere as possible. I am not sure it is very brave, nor struck with its
being very industrious. But it has an unfailing sense of the amenities
of life; the poorest Venetian is a natural man of the world. He is
better company than persons of his class are apt to be among the nations
of industry and virtue--where people are also sometimes perceived to lie
and steal and otherwise misconduct themselves. He has a great desire to
please and to be pleased.

In that matter at least the cold-blooded stranger begins at last to
imitate him; begins to lead a life that shall be before all things easy;
unless indeed he allow himself, like Mr. Ruskin, to be put out of humour
by Titian and Tiepolo. The hours he spends among the pictures are his
best hours in Venice, and I am ashamed to have written so much of
common things when I might have been making festoons of the names of
the masters. Only, when we have covered our page with such festoons
what more is left to say? When one has said Carpaccio and Bellini, the
Tintoret and the Veronese, one has struck a note that must be left to
resound at will. Everything has been said about the mighty painters, and
it is of little importance that a pilgrim the more has found them to
his taste. “Went this morning to the Academy; was very much pleased with
Titian’s ‘Assumption.’” That honest phrase has doubtless been written
in many a traveller’s diary, and was not indiscreet on the part of
its author. But it appeals little to the general reader, and we must
moreover notoriously not expose our deepest feelings. Since I have
mentioned Titian’s “Assumption” I must say that there are some people
who have been less pleased with it than the observer we have just
imagined. It is one of the possible disappointments of Venice, and you
may if you like take advantage of your privilege of not caring for it.
It imparts a look of great richness to the side of the beautiful room of
the Academy on which it hangs; but the same room contains two or three
works less known to fame which are equally capable of inspiring a
passion. “The ‘Annunciation’ struck me as coarse and superficial”: that
note was once made in a simple-minded tourist’s book. At Venice, strange
to say, Titian is altogether a disappointment; the city of his adoption
is far from containing the best of him. Madrid, Paris, London, Florence,
Dresden, Munich--these are the homes of his greatness.

There are other painters who have but a single home, and the greatest of
these is the Tintoret. Close beside him sit Carpaccio and Bellini, who
make with him the dazzling Venetian trio. The Veronese may be seen and
measured in other places; he is most splendid in Venice, but he shines
in Paris and in Dresden. You may walk out of the noon-day dusk of
Trafalgar Square in November, and in one of the chambers of the National
Gallery see the family of Darius rustling and pleading and weeping
at the feet of Alexander. Alexander is a beautiful young Venetian in
crimson pantaloons, and the picture sends a glow into the cold London
twilight. You may sit before it for an hour and dream you are floating
to the water-gate of the Ducal Palace, where a certain old beggar who
has one of the handsomest heads in the world--he has sat to a hundred
painters for Doges and for personages more sacred--has a prescriptive
right to pretend to pull your gondola to the steps and to hold out a
greasy immemorial cap. But you must go to Venice in very fact to see
the other masters, who form part of your life while you are there, who
illuminate your view of the universe. It is difficult to express one’s
relation to them; the whole Venetian art-world is so near, so familiar,
so much an extension and adjunct of the spreading actual, that it seems
almost invidious to say one owes more to one of them than to the other.
Nowhere, not even in Holland, where the correspondence between the
real aspects and the little polished canvases is so constant and so
exquisite, do art and life seem so interfused and, as it were, so
consanguineous. All the splendour of light and colour, all the Venetian
air and the Venetian history are on the walls and ceilings of the
palaces; and all the genius of the masters, all the images and visions
they have left upon canvas, seem to tremble in the sunbeams and dance
