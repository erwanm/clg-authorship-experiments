pleasant--pleasant for both; but I must go now, and we shall not see
each other any more.”

“In this life, Satan, but in another? We shall meet in another, surely?”

  [Illustration: “LIFE ITSELF IS ONLY A VISION, A DREAM”]

Then, all tranquilly and soberly, he made the strange answer, “ There
is no other. ”

A subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his, bringing with it a
vague, dim, but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words
might be true--even must be true.

“Have you never suspected this, Theodor?”

“No. How could I? But if it can only be true--”

“It is true.”

A gust of thankfulness rose in my breast, but a doubt checked it before
it could issue in words, and I said, “But--but--we have seen that
future life--seen it in its actuality, and so--”

“It was a vision--it had no existence.”

I could hardly breathe for the great hope that was struggling in me. “A
vision?--a vi--”

“ Life itself is only a vision, a dream. ”

It was electrical. By God! I had had that very thought a thousand times
in my musings!

“ Nothing  exists; all is a dream. God--man--the world--the sun, the
moon, the wilderness of stars--a dream, all a dream; they have no
existence.  Nothing exists save empty space--and you! ”

“I!”

“And you are not you--you have no body, no blood, no bones, you are but
a  thought . I myself have no existence; I am but a dream--your dream,
creature of your imagination. In a moment you will have realized this,
then you will banish me from your visions and I shall dissolve into
the nothingness out of which you made me....

“I am perishing already--I am failing--I am passing away. In a
little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its
limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever--for you will
remain a  thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature
inextinguishable, indestructible. But I, your poor servant, have
revealed you to yourself and set you free. Dream other dreams, and
better!

“Strange! that you should not have suspected years ago--centuries,
ages, eons ago!--for you have existed, companionless, through all the
eternities. Strange, indeed, that you should not have suspected that
your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction!
Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane--like
all dreams: a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet
preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them
happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their
bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal
happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who
gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with
biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and
invented hell--mouths mercy and invented hell--mouths Golden Rules, and
forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who
mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon
crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then
tries to shuffle the responsibility for man’s acts upon man, instead
of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally,
with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to
worship him!...

“You perceive,  now, that these things are all impossible except
in a dream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities,
the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its
freaks--in a word, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The
dream-marks are all present; you should have recognized them earlier.
