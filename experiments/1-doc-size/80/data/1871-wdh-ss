ing of admirably small children making purchases 
there. The number of the Httle ones was quite as 
remarkable as their size, and ought to have been 
even more interesting, if, as sometimes appears prob- 
able, such increase shall — together with the well- 
known ambition of Dubliners to rule the land — one 
day make an end of us poor Yankees as a dominant 
plurality. 

The town was somewhat tainted with our archi- 
tectural respectability, unless the newness of some 
of the buildings gave illusion of this ; and, though 
the streets of Dubhn were not at all cared for, and 
though every house on the main thoroughfare stood 
upon the brink of a slough, without yard, or any 
attempt at garden or shrubbery, there were many 
cottages in the less aristocratic quarters inclosed in 
palings, and embowered in the usual suburban pear- 
trees and currant-bushes. These, indeed, were 
dwellings of an elder sort, and had clearly been 
inherited from a population now as extinct in that 
region as the Pequots, and they were not always 
careftdly cherished. On the border of the hamlet is 
to be seen an old farm-house of the poorer sort, built 
about the beginning of this century, and now thickly 
peopled by Dubliners. Its gate is thrown down, and 
the great wild-grown lilac hedge, no longer protected 
by a fence, shows skirts bedabbled by the familiarity 
of lawless poultry, as little like the steady-habited 
poultry of other times, as the people of the house 
are like the former inmates, long since dead or gone 
West. I offer the poor place a sentiment of regret 
as I pass, thinking of its better days. I think of its 
decorous, hard-working, cleanly, school-going, church- 
attending life, which was full of the pleasure of duty 
done, and was not without its own quaint beauty 
and grace. What long Sabbaths were kept in that 
old house, what scanty holidays ! Yet irom this and 
such as this came the dominion of the whole wild 
continent, the freedom of a race, the greatness of 
the greatest people. It may be that I regretted a 
little too exultantly, and that out of this particular 
house came only peddling of innumerable clocks 
and multitudinous tin-ware. But as yet, it is pretty 
certain that the general character of the population 
has not gained by the change. What is in the 
fiiture, let the prophets say ; any one can see that 
something not quite agreeable is in the present; 
something that takes the wrong side, as by instinct, 
in politics ; something that mainly helps to prop up 

tottering priestcraft among us ; something that one 
thinks of with dismay as destined to control so 
largely the civil and religious interests erf" the coun- 
try. This, however, is only the aggregate aspect. 
Mrs. Clannahan's kitchen, as it may be seen by the 
desperate philosopher when he goes to engage her 
for the spring house-cleaning, is a strong argument 
against his fears. If Mrs. Clannahan, lately of an 
Irish cabin, can show a kitchen so capably appointed 
and so neatly kept as that, the country may yet 
be an inch or two from the brink of ruin, and the 
race which we trust as little as we love may turn out 
no more spendthrift than most heirs. It is encour- 
aging, moreover, when any people can flatter them- 
selves upon a superior prosperity and virtue, and we 
may take heart from the fact that the French Cana- 
dians, many of whom have lodgings in Dublin, are 
not well seen by the higher classes of the citizens 
there. Mrs. Clannahan, whose house stands over 
against the main gate of the grave-yard, and who 
may, therefore, be considered as moving in the best 
Dublin society, hints, that though good Catholics, the 
French are not thought perfectly honest, — " things 
have been missed " since they came to blight with 
their crimes and vices the once happy seat of integ- 
rity. It is amusing to find Dublin fearful of the en- 
croachment of the French, as we, in our turn, dread 
the advance of the Irish. We must make a jest of 
our own alarms, and even smile — since we cannot
