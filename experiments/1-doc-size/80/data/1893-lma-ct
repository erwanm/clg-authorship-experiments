Bianca. Adelbert, dear love, now haste thee quickly up to me.
                                   [Enter Adelbert upon the balcony.
Adel. Sweet love, why fearest thou? None dare stay me when I fly to
thee. Ah, sit thee here, and I will rest beside thee. [Bianca seats
herself; Adelbert lies at her feet.]
Bianca. Thou art weary, love. I'll bring thee wine, and thou shalt rest
while I do sing to thee. [She gives him wine; he drinks.]
Adel. Thanks to thee, dearest love, I am weary now no longer. When here
beside thee, pain, sorrow, time are all forgot. Ah! what is this?--a
deadly pang hath seized me. All grows dark before mine eyes. I cannot
see thee. Yon cup,--'twas poisoned! I am dying, dying!
Bianca. Ah, nay, thou art faint! Speak not of dying, love. [Adelbert
falls.] Adelbert, Adelbert, speak!--speak! It is thine own Bianca
calls thee! [Throws herself beside him.]
Adel. Farewell, dear love, farewell! Huon hath won his vengeance now.
God bless thee, dearest. Oh, farewell! [Dies.]
Bianca. Awake! awake! All, cold and still! Thou true, brave heart, thou
art hushed forever. Huon! yes! 'twas he; and he hath sought to win me
thus. But 'tis in vain! Where is the poisoned cup that I may join thee,
Adelbert? [Takes the cup.] Ah, 'tis gone: there is no more. Yet I will
be with thee, my murdered love. For me life hath no joy, and I will find
thee even in death [falls fainting to the ground].
                                CURTAIN.
                              SCENE FIFTH.
                           [Bianca's castle.
                    The garden. Bianca singing.]
    Faded flowers, faded flowers,
      They are all now left to cherish;
    For the hopes and joys of my young life's spring
      I have seen so darkly perish.
    Cold, ah, cold, in the lone, dark grave,
      My murdered love lies low,
    And death alone can bring sure rest
      To this broken heart's deep woe.
    Faded flowers, faded flowers,
      They are all now left to cherish;
    For ah, his dear hand gathered them,
      And my love can never perish.
                                                               [Weeps.
                                 [Enter Huon and kneels at her feet.
Bianca [starting up]. Fiend! demon! touch me not with hands that
murdered him! Hence! out of my sight,--away!
Huon. Nay, lady, nay! I swear by Heaven it was not I. The spell I
mingled in thy cup was but to win thy love. The old witch hath deceived
me, and given that deadly poison. Forgive me, I implore thee, and here
let me offer thee my love once more.
Bianca [repulsing him]. Love! darest thou to speak of love to me,
whose bright dream of life thou hast destroyed? Love! I who loathe,
scorn, hate thee with a deep and burning hate that death alone can
still! Oh, Heaven, have mercy on my tortured heart, and let it break.
Huon [aside]. His death hath well-nigh driven her mad. Dear lady,
grieve not thus. Let me console thee. Forget thy love, and seek in mine
the joy thou hast lost.
Bianca. Forget! Ah, never, never, till in death I join him! Forgive
thee? Not till I have told thy crime. Yes, think not I will rest till
thou, my murdered Adelbert, art well avenged. And thou!--ah, sinful
man, tremble, for thou art in my power, and my wronged heart can feel no
pity now.
Huon [fiercely]. Wouldst thou betray me? Never! Yield thou to my love,
or I will sheathe my dagger in thy heart, and silence thee forever!
Bianca. I will not yield. The world shall know thy guilt, and then sweet
death shall be a blessing.
Huon. Then die, and free me from the love and fear that hang like clouds
above me [stabs her].
Bianca. Thy sin will yet be known, and may God pardon thee! O earth,
farewell! My Adelbert, I come, I come! [Dies.]
Huon. Dead! dead! Oh, wretched Huon! Where now seek rest from bitter
memories and remorse. Ha, a step! I must fly. Angel, fare thee well!
                                                           [Exit Huon.
                                CURTAIN.
                              SCENE SIXTH.
               [Huon's room. Huon asleep upon a couch.
               Enter Bianca's spirit. She lays her hand
                              upon him.]
Huon [starting in affright]. Ha! spirit of the dead, what wouldst thou
now? For long, long nights why hast thou haunted me? Cannot my agony,
remorse, and tears win thee to forget? Ah, touch me not! Away! away! See
how the vision follows. It holds me fast. Bianca, save me! save me!
[Falls and dies.]
                                                             [Tableau.
