her, in his own way, and that she knew it, as women generally do, and
could exasperate him, perhaps, into some folly of which he might repent,
by simply treating him coldly, as she threatened.

During the silence which followed, she sat with folded arms and
half-closed eyes, looking at him defiantly from under her lids.

'You do me a great injustice,' he said.

'I am sorry,' she answered. 'I have no choice. I value my good name as a
woman, besides my reputation as an artist. You do not justify yourself
in the only way in your power by explaining clearly what the insuperable
difficulties are in the way of our marriage.'

The notary's daughter did not lack logic.

'I never said that they were insuperable--'

'Then overcome them, if you want me,' answered Aliandra implacably.

'I said that there were difficulties, and there are great ones. You
speak of making a fortune by your voice, my dear Aliandra,' he
continued, his tones sweetening. 'But you must understand that a man who
is a gentleman does not like to be dependent on his wife's profession
for his support.'

'I do not see that it is more dignified to depend on his wife's money
because she had not earned it by hard work,' retorted the singer
scornfully. 'It is honestly earned.'

'The honour is entirely yours,' said Tebaldo. 'The world would grant me
no share in it. Then there are my mother's objections, which are strong
ones,' he went on quickly. 'She has, of course, a right to be consulted,
and she does not even know you.'

'It is in your power to introduce me to your mother whenever you
please.'

'She is too ill to see anyone--'

'She has not always been ill. You have either been afraid to bring an
artist to your mother's house, which is not flattering to me, or else
you never had the slightest intention of marrying me, in spite of much
that you have said. Though I have heard you call your brother Francesco
a coward, I think he is braver than you, for he would marry me
to-morrow, if I would have him.'

'And live on what you earn,' retorted Tebaldo, with ready scorn.

'He has as much as you have,' observed Aliandra. 'Your uncle left no
will, and you all shared the property equally--'

'You are not a notary's daughter for nothing,' laughed Tebaldo. 'That is
true. But there was very little to share. Do you know what was left when
the debts were paid? A bit of land here in Rome--that was all, besides
Camaldoli. Both have been sold advantageously, and we have just enough
to live decently all together. We should be paupers if we tried to
separate.'

'You are nothing if not plausible. But you will forgive me if I say that
this difficulty has the air of being really insuperable. You absolutely
refuse to share what I earn, and you are absolutely incapable of earning
anything yourself. That being the case, the sooner you go away the
better, for you can never marry me, on your own showing, and you are
injuring my reputation in the meantime.'

'I am engaged in speculations, in which I hope to make money,' said
Tebaldo. 'I often tell you that I have appointments with men of
business--'

'Yes, you often tell me so,' interrupted Aliandra, incredulously.

'You are cold, and you are calculating,' retorted Tebaldo, with a sudden
change of manner, as though taking offence at last.

'It is fortunate for me that I am not hot-headed and foolish,' replied
Aliandra, coolly.

They parted on these terms. She believed that her coldness would bring
him to her feet if anything could; but he was persuaded that his brother
