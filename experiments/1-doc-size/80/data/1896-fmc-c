He had hesitated, at first, as to whether he should seek out Tebaldo and
try to force the truth from him by sheer violence, but he had given up
the idea at once as being absurd. If he failed, as he might fail,--for
Tebaldo was desperately brave,--he should simply be creating fresh
evidence of the hatred which existed between the two families, not to
mention the fact that any such encounter might easily end in more
bloodshed. Even to his unimaginative mind there seemed to be a strange
fatality in the whole story. He had killed one brother in self-defence,
or in what the law considered to be that, and now Ippolito was accused
of murdering another of the brothers. It was wiser to leave the third
alone, and to trust to the law to prove Ippolito's innocence. Orsino was
not a man who instinctively loved violence and fighting, as some men do.
He felt that if San Giacinto had been present he would somehow have
managed to set Ippolito free and get Tebaldo imprisoned in his place, by
sheer strength and the power of terror which he exerted over so many
people, but which, to do him justice, he did not abuse. The giant was an
extraordinary man, mentally and physically, and always put action before
logic, and logic before sentiment. Orsino, on the contrary, generally
wished to think out every matter to the end before acting, though he was
neither slow nor timid when he had ultimately made up his mind.

So far as he could do so, he had decided and acted; and his thoughts
reverted to the situation itself, and most directly, now, to his love
for Vittoria. He had been looking forward to seeing her before long, for
he had begun to understand that his presence in Camaldoli was not often
necessary for many days at a time; and of late, during his lonely rides,
he had given himself up to planning some means of meeting her during his
next visit to Rome.

She was the principal and central being in his whole daily life. The
separation was not one of distance only, for there were other and almost
insuperable obstacles to his marriage. After Ferdinando's death, after
Maria Carolina d'Oriani's terrible imprecations, after his own father's
absolute refusal to listen to the proposal, it seemed almost impossible
that he should ever really marry Vittoria. And now, as though to crush
the last possibility out of existence, this new and terrible disaster
had fallen like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.

Orsino was not very easily roused, but persistent opposition had the
effect of slowly increasing the tension of his nature. Events had this
effect upon him in a cumulative way. And his moral force slowly rose, as
water in a huge embanked reservoir, into which, being empty, the little
stream trickles idly, as though it had no force at all; but ever quietly
flowing in from the source, it covers the bottom little by little, and
still flows in, day by day, week by week; and the water rises slowly and
very surely, gathering its terrible, incompressible weight into itself
from the streamlet, till the body of it is deep and broad, and its
weight is millions of tons, calm and still and ever rising; and then,
one day, the freshet comes hissing down the bed of the stream, and the
last rise in the reservoir is sudden and awful. The huge embankment
quivers and rocks, and bursts at last; and the pent-up strength of the
water is let loose in one moment, and sweeps howling and roaring down
the valley, carrying death in its bosom and leaving utter desolation
behind.

As he rode down through the silent night, the man wondered when he
thought of the emptiness in which his life had once moved, of how little
he had cared for anything, of the imperturbable indifference with which
he had thought of all the world. For he was beginning to feel his
strength in him, matched against the resistance of events.

A girl had wrought the change; and even in his great perplexity and
trouble, his face softened in the dark as he thought of her. Yet he
knew, as grown men do, that only half the secret was in her, and that
the other half was in himself. For the strength of love is that it is
the source of all existing life, and is a law which men and women obey,
as atoms are subject to gravitation. That is the strength of it. But the
beauty of love, and the happiness, and the nobility, are of a higher and
finer essence, not suddenly to be seen, grasped, and taken, but
distilled in life's alembic of that which was before life, and shall be
afterwards, for ever.

Orsino was not imaginative, and his nature was not of that kind which is
commonly called spiritual, which is given to contemplation, and delights
in the beautiful traceries of the soul's guesswork. He vaguely
understood that there was more between his father and mother and in
their happiness than he would have called love, though there was nothing
for which he might not hope. At present his love was that great natural
law, from which, if one comes within the sphere of its attraction, there
is no more escape than there is from hunger and thirst. He dignified it
