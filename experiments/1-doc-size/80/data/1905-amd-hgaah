almost like a winter night." 

"If someone would come along !" 

They all shouted in unison and a thousand 
echoes were the only answer. Again and again 
they shouted until the woods rang, but with no 
result. 

"We cannot stay here all night, though I think 
there would be a rescue party. Til tell you what 
I am going to do. Do you see that light glim- 
mering through the little opening? Fm sure it 
is a house. I'm going to wade to the shore and 
run up there." 

May Bradshaw stood up in her young strength, 
her voice inspiring. 



 

"Oh, you don't know how deep the water is." 

"ril take an oar to measure. Don't be afraid." 

"But you'll get awful wet." 

"ril pin up my skirts and not mind the rest" 

She stepped out bravely with the oar for an 
alpenstock, and threaded her way safely, giving a

smile. 

Powerfully hungry he seemed to be. The 
woman insisted that Miss Bradshaw should have 
a cup of tea and a chunk of 'lasses cake, but she 
would accept only a glass of milk. It was rather 


funny to hear the children's good natured wran- 
gle. At last Jack was ready to start. 

It was a rough road and a very long "spell," 
Miss Bradshaw thought, and here they had just 
finished supper. There was Mr. Beecroft and 
his wife, Tim, eighteen or so, and two girls. Miss 
Bradshaw repeated her story. 

"Well, if that don't beat all!" exclaimed the 
senior. "Last week we thought we'd blast the 
pesky thing out, it's bothered for years. We 
did kick up a bobbery but we hadn't enough dyna- 
mite. We split the thing consid'able, an' I s'pose
