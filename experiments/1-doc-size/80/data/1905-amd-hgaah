you can hardly understand the feeling of one who 
knows herself poor in spirit â€” " 

"Why, that is one of the beatitudes," inter- 
rupted Helen. "Think of the promise !" 

"But mine is in things to give away," protested 
Juliet. 




"Oh, don't you remember the bit of verse from 
Pilgrim's Progress: 

"There was a man though some do count him mad; 
The more he gave away the more he had.' 

And I believe many small graces grow with the 
using. You simply give the best you have if 
you see it pleases. Mrs. Wilmarth is passionately 
fond of music, and you can minister to her there. 
You are a very good reader, oh, and you know 
such quantities of exquisite verses, just the thing 
to say over in the twilight. So no more humility, 
if you please, but accept with great gladness of 
heart that you have found some one to whom 
neither wealth nor poverty makes any dif- 
ference." 

"You put everything in such an attractive light 
that one must needs be convinced," was the

Even Helen could not quite understand the

Grant with the inspiriting note in her voice, the 
bright good humor, the shining eyes, the readi- 
ness to help, and her different experiences had 
given her a wisdom that does not always come in 
youth. 

Early in June Mrs. Aldred returned. The girls 
had made a parterre of the house. Wreaths and 
branches of bloom made the air fragrant and over 
the doorway was the word "Welcome" woven of 
golden-hearted daisies. 

They went to the station in a procession, for 
the train did not get in until five o'clock. There 
were friends and neighbors, too, and the ovation 
touched the traveler to the heart, and was always 
one of her choicest remembrances. 

The girls escorted her home in triumph. She 
had changed very little except to appear younger, 
the rest and pleasure had improved her, and 
the joyous greeting made her seem a girl with

It being Friday evening there were no lessons. 
They all went out on the porch in the moonlight 
and made a circle about her, eager to hear some
