He was standing, looking absently into the fire. How 
should he tell his paper and pencil that night what he saw 
there — what flaring winds of passion, what castles and the 
shapes of leaves ? " What's your company ? " 

"I won't tell you — not unless you promise you'll think 
of going in with me. If you'll do that, maybe I will." 

Lovell shook his head. 

" No," he said, " no. I don't know anything about your 
companies and your shares. Come, let 's get to bed. I don't 
want to turn you out — " 

Tim picked up his hat and went, begging to the last, and 
Lovell, shutting the door on him with small ceremony, took 
the lamp and went into his bedroom. It had a good-sized 
mirror, taken from the big house because the poet side of 
him loved sumptuous things and the gilt scroll-work on it 
pleased him. He stood before it, lamp in hand, and looked 
at himself, frowning a little with the intentness of the scru- 
tiny. What he saw pleased him but moderately, — a man of 
good size and bearing, with a square forehead, very direct 
gray-blue eyes, and a firm enough mouth with diversifying 
curves in it. The mouth was odious to him because his mem- 
ories of what his mother and sister used to say of it were 
still so disconcerting. "James has a beautiful mouth," he 
heard his mother remark, fondly contemplating his photo- 
graph, which she insisted on keeping on the centre table 
propped against the astral lamp. She never looked at him 
when she said it, and James, with a sense that the mouth was 
something that was his and yet not his, used to writhe in 
his chair under the feeling that the idea had become so im- 
personal to her that she might offer it at any time, in any 
company. 

" Beautiful ! " his sister would dutifully respond, because 
the rule of the house was that mother, because she was mother 



 





and had a stiff knee, m\ist be indulged. Lovell thought that 
had got him into his habit of biting his lips, a vice he pursued 
until his mother noted it and watched him for its recurrence, 
saying at each downfall, " Don't do that, my son. You have 
a beautiful mouth." 

Well, he thought, the mouth was there. It was sufficiently 
firm, even after all it had gone through. It was well enough. 
The chin was finely cut, and he elected to pay no attention 
to the dimple in it. What he chiefly wished to see was whether 
he looked in the main no worse, if no better, than other fel- 
lows who might not have had his own tawdry experience. The 
lamp gave him no ecstatic assurance, but it offered no facers, 
and he went to bed, to forget himself and what he was pretty 
sure was going to be the morrow's foolish deed. 

But the next afternoon it was without thinking much about 
it, except as an act already determined upon, that, in all the 
austerity of his conventional gear, he went up to the Win- 
terbournes' and knocked. He had been used to walking in, 
after the familiar custom of the town, for his lost evenings 
with Wintcrbourne and the Greeks; but those were behind 
him. He never hoped for them again, and saw before him 
the exacting call of a new relation miserably veiled, as yet, in 
doubt. 

Lyddy came limping to the door, and stared at him with 
a frank surprise. Perhaps if he had not looked her in the 
eye and asked somewhat more severely than anything save a 
wavering will, giving itself even the advantage of a truculent 
port, might have counselled, she would have frankly told him 
how he seemed to her in his new clothes. But she informed
