" Well, well, captain, you must go to the hospital; 
and Captain what's-his-name " 

" Captain de Banyan, at your service," promptly re- 
sponded Somers's faithful friend. 

" Captain de Banyan shall report for you, and tell me 
all about this scrape," added the general. " Get into 
your carriage, Captain Somers, and go to the hospital. 
I will call and see you to-day or to-morrow." 

" Thank you, general." 

Captain de Banyan assisted him into the ambulance ; 
and, when he had placed him in the care of the surgeon, 
he returned to headquarters to tell the marvellous story 
of their capture by the rebels, and their escape from 



 

Petersburg. It is quite likely that he did not add his 
experience in Tennessee ; but, when the general called on 
Somers at the hospital the next morning, the latter sup- 
plied all that had been withheld. The general had a 
higher regard for the captain's patriotism than ever 
before ; for he had voluntarily renounced the ranks of 
rebellion, and placed himself on the side of his country. 
There was nothing against him : on the contrary, his 
conduct had been in the highest degree praiseworthy. 
But Captain de Banyan was sensitive on this point ; and 
the general readily promised to conceal what the brave 
fellow regarded as a stain upon his character. 

Captain Somers did not improve so rapidly as his 
friends desired. The surgeon declared that his night- 
ride from Petersburg, in his feeble condition, had done 
him more injury than a year's hard service ; and, after he 
had been in the hospital ten days, it was deemed ad- 
visable to give him a furlough, and send him home, 
especially as the division was then under orders to 
march to Yorktown. The gallant youni? hero regretted 

the necessity of leaving the regiment just as he had been 
promoted ; but he was in no condition to endure the long 
and weary march. He was able to walk about a little ; 
and, on the day before the sailing of the transport by 
which he was to proceed to Washington, he received 
another visit from the general. 

After a few kind inquiries in regard to the invalid's 



 

condition, the general took from his pocket one of those 
great official envelopes which so often carry joy to the 
heart of the gallant officer. Somers was amazed. It 
could not be possible that his own promotion was indi- 
cated by this document. It was not three weeks since 
his commission as captain had reached him ; but then 
Senator Guilford was a great man, and wielded a tre- 
mendous influence, both at Washington, and with the 
military authorities of his native State. 

Recalling his former declaration to Captain de Ban- 
yan, he was fully resolved to decline any further promo- 
tion, at least until he had done something which entitled 
him to this distinction. The general held up the formi- 
dable packet, while Sorners's pale face was suffused with 
blushes. 

" I have brought you a major's commission, Somers ; 
and I know it will give you joy." 

" Really, sir ; ah ! general, I don't think"
