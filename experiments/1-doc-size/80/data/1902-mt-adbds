der, ve'y tired — face wet, been cry- 
Injan's' spose; fetch her home, feed her, 
she heap much hungry — go 'sleep.'
In her limitless gratitude the happy 
mother waived rank and hugged him 
too, calling him ''the angel of God 
in disguise." 
And he probably was in disguise 
if he was that kind of an official. He 
was dressed for the character. 
At half past one in the morning 
the procession burst into the village, 
singing " When Johnny Comes March- 
ing Home," waving its lanterns, and 
swallowing the drinks that were 
brought out all along its course. It  
concentrated at the tavern, and made  
a night of what was left of the morning. 
I 
HE next afternoon the 
village was electrified 
with an immense sen- 
sation. A grave and 
dignified foreigner of distinguished 
bearing and appearance had arrived 
at the tavern, and entered this for 
midable name upon the register: 
Sherlock Holmes. 
The news buzzed from cabin to 
cabin, from claim to claim; tools 
were dropped, and the town swarmed 
toward the centre of interest. A man 
passing out at the northern end of 
the village shouted it to Pat Riley, 
whose claim was the next one to 
Flint Buckner's. At that time Fet- 
lock Jones seemed to turn sick. He 
muttered to himself: 
" Uncle Sherlock I The mean luck 
of it I — that he should come just 
when , . ." He dropped into a rev- 
erie, and presently said to himself: 
"But what's the use of being afraid 
of him? Anybody that knows him 
the way I do knows he can't detect a 
crime, except when he plans it all out 
beforehand and arranges the clews 
and hires some fellow to commit 
it according to instructions. . . . 
Now there ain't going to he any clews 
this time — so, what show has he got? 
None at all. No, sir; everything's 
ready. If I was to risk putting it 
off. . . . No, I won't run any risk like 
that. Flint Buckner goes out of this 
world to-night, for sure." Then an- 
other trouble presented itself. "Un- 
cle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk 
home matters with me this evening, 
and how am I going to get rid of him? 
for I've got to be at my cabin a minute  
or two about eight o'clock." This 
was an awkward matter, and cost 
him much thought. But he found 
a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll 
go for a walk, and I'll leave him in 
the road a minute, so that he won't 
see what it is I do: the best way to 
throw a detective off the track, anyway, 
is to have him along when you 
are preparing the thing. Yes, that's 
the safest — I'll take him with me." 
Meantime the road in front of the 
tavern was blocked with villagers 
waiting and hoping for a glimpse of 
the g reat m an. But he kept his 
room, and did not appear. None 
but Ferguson, Jake Parker the black- 
smith, and Ham Sandwich had any 
luck. These enthusiastic admirers of
