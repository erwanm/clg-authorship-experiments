the whole thing." 

"It's true as gospel; I seen it 
myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll 
know better one of these days." 

"Say, boys, who do you reckon 
done it?'' 

That was a difficult question, and 
brought out a world of unsatisfying 
conjecture. Various men were men- 
tioned as possibilities, but one by one 
they were discarded as not being eli- 
gible. No one but young Hillyer had 
been intimate with Flint Buckner; no 
one had really had a quarrel with him ; 
he had affronted every man who had 
tried to make up to him, although not 
quite offensively enough to require 
bloodshed. There was one name that 
was upon every tongue from the start, 
but it was the last to get utterance 
— Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley 
that mentioned it. 

"Oh, well," the boys said, "of 
course weVe all thought of him, be- 
cause he had a million rights to kill 
Flint Buckner, and it was just his 
plain duty to do it. But all the same 
there's two things we can't get around : 
for one thing, he hasn't got the sand ; 
and for another, he wasn't anywhere 
near the place when it happened." 

"I know it," said Pat. "He was 
there in the billiard - room with us 
when it happened." 

" Yes, and was there all the time for 
an hour bejore it happened." 

"It's so. And lucky for him, too. 
He'd have been suspected in a minute 
if it hadn't been for that." 

HE tavern dining-room 
had been cleared of all 
its furniture save one 
six-foot pine table and 
a chair. This table was against one 
end of the room; the chair was on it; 
Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, 
impressive, sat in the chair. The 
public stood. The room was full. 
The tobacco smoke was dense, the 
stillness profound. 

The Extraordinary Man raised his 
hand to clomnand additional silence; 

held it in the air a few moments ; then, 
in brief, crisp terms he put forward 
question after question, and noted the Thinks 


answers with Um-ums, nods of the voice 

head, and so on. By this process he 
learned all about Flint Buckner, his 
character, conduct, and habits, that 
the people were able to tell him. It 
thus transpired that the Extraordinary 
Man's nephew was the only person in 
the camp who had a killing-grudge 
against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes 
smiled compassionately upon the wit- 
ness, and asked, languidly —
