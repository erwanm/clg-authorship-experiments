Such a noise in that deathly stillness would 
wake every echo and every inmate of the 
house. The chance of crawling through into 
the kitchen and escaping upstairs before dis 
covery was too slight to be worth the risk. 
Besides, the dumb waiter might be fastened 
upon the other side. 

" C-h-a-r-ming little fix ! Now I should like 
to know ! Let me see ; if I tip over, no, I 
won't tip over. Mrs. M. would be frantic. If 
I stay where I am and go to sleep, why, by- 
and-by it will be morning, and Nancy will be 
up building the furnace fire early, and if she 
doesn't expect her third cousin to walk round 
by daylight, she will let me out ; and what .s 
more, she will hold her tongue about it. But 
to sleep in a sugar-barrel ! Let 's taste ; yes, 
to be sure. I wonder how many pounds there 
are, or quarts don't they sell sugar by the 
quart? I wonder if I shall have to pay for it 



You blessed little woman at home, what would 
you think of this? I wonder what the girls 
did with my pick-le and " 

By the time that she had thought as far as 
this, she was asleep. So, by that time, was 
every one else. Maude Clare and the rest, 
finding that she and the crackers did not make 
their appearance, supposed that she had been 
playing a trick upon them, and was gone to 
bed. Jane Bruce, sound asleep half an hour 
ago, did not suppose anything about her. 

In the middle of the night there was an 
unearthly noise in the china-closet. Gypsy, 
dreaming that there was a mouse down her 
neck, had tipped over her barrel. 

Miss Ayre came to her door and screamed 
" Robbers ! " Mrs. Holt appeared in an in 
describable wrapper, groped into the dining- 
room, tripped over the inevitable rocking-chair, 
and fiercely demanded, "Who 's there? Mr. 
Holt, bring along that gun ! " This worthy 
man, twenty years since departed to a world 
where thieves do not break through and steal, 


was invariably at least so ran the traditiofc 
made formidable use of against that per 
sistent burglar by whom the dreams of his 
valiant relict were almost nightly disturbed. 
" Mr. Holt 's gun " had passed into a proverb 
at the Golden Crescent, but never with her own 
ears had Gypsy actually heard it appealed to 
before. It took her so long to smother her 
laughter and gain her breath, that Mrs. Holt 
had gone back to bed, and the house was 's . 'll 
again, and she had not called for help. 

" However, now I 'm tipped over," she 
thought, " I don't see what is to prevent my 
trying the dumb waiter and getting upstairs in 
my stocking-feet Hilloa ! " 

The dumb waiter was fastened upon the 
other side. 

There being nothing to do but to go to sleep 
again, Gypsy lay down with her head in the 
barrel, and went to sleep ; and that was the last 
she knew till it was morning, and somebody 
was trying the key in the door. 

Mrs. Holt had waked at six o'clock and
