rate, he was out of her way for a year ; and she took 
all beyond that time on trust. 




CHAPTER XXVIII. 



N the day after John's departure, Mrs. 
Guy received the following letter, 
without signature. It came from 
some person in the school where Ly- 
dia had been placed : 

" MADAM : I feel it my duty to 
say that your daughter Lydia is re 
ceiving the attentions of a young man 
in this neighborhood, who cannot possibly be acceptable 
to her family. To my certain knowledge, they hold 
clandestine interviews at night, she stealing from her 
room at a late hour, to join him. My concern for her 
welfare, prompts me to send you this information." 

Twice did Mrs. Guy read this communication, with 
out exhibiting a sign of disturbance. Then, taking a 
match, she lighted the gas, and holding the letter in the 
flame until it was consumed, flung the charred flakes 
from the window. 

The letter was anonymous, and behind this fact Mrs. 
Guy shielded herself. That it gave her the exact truth,

"Fearing," she said the writer was a woman 
" that a communication sent to you several days ago, 
may have failed in reaching its destination, I address 
you again on the subject of your daughter, now at 
school in this place. Do you know that she is receiv 
ing the attentions of a young man residing here, and 
that she is in the habit of meeting him at night, clan 
destinely ? The young man is well enough in his way, 
but not the one that you could accept as Lydia's hus 
band. Pray look to the matter before it is too late ! I 
have now, twice, given you warning, and so washed 
my hands clear of the whole matter." 

" Anonymous ! " And Mrs. Guy shook her head. 
Alighted match the gas in aflame and then a 
little handful of black ashes were flung from the window. 

" It wont do, my jealous young lady." A cold smile 
played over the lips of Mrs. Guy, as she sat down, and 
took up a book that she had been reading. 

With an eager interest, that absorbed nearly every 
thought, did Mrs. Guy wait the issue which she believed 
to be at hand. If Lydia should contract a clandestine 
marriage with a young man having neither social posi-
