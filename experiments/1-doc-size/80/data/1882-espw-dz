" You speak in figures," said the woman of science, 
curtly. " I am a person of facts. I fail to 
follow you." 
They called at those Baileys who had become 



 

historic during the scarlet fever, and Yorke looked 
about him with vague reminiscences. The woman 
came to the door to welcome the doctor, extending 
her lean arm. 

"There! It 's the sign-post woman!" cried 
Yorke. " We owe it all to her." 

" You are strangling in allegory, again. It is a 
case of asphyxia," said the doctor, handing him 
the blue reins. 

" I mean, we owe it to her that I ever got to 
Sherman, a precious sort of debt you think it ! 
Your eyes laugh loud enough to be heard in Ban- 
gor. You might spare a shattered man so innocent 
a delusion. Science would be none the less 
exact for it. Hang no, bless Mrs. Bailey ! It 
was she who put me up to By the way, Doctor, 
did you drop it by accident, or did you mean " 

" How 's that leg of Bob 's ? " asked the doctor, 
in her happy soprano. She was half-way up the 
dreary front yard. The children ran to meet her, 
a forlorn little batch, and the woman clung 
to her with an uncouth, pathetic gesture, half 
reverence, half fearless love. Mrs. Bailey never 
thought of paying a doctor 's bill, but she wore 
new mourning for her baby. Her affection was 
none the less genuine for that. Doctor Zay did 
not grudge her the sleazy alpaca. 



 

There was a sacredness to the physician beyond 
the pale of enlightened social science, in the clasp 
of those scraggy black arms. Mrs. Bailey might 
outrage political economy, and retard the millen 
nium by becoming a pauper ; but she trusted her 
doctor, and had lost her baby. 

Yorke knew little about people of this sort ; he 
had left the lower orders of society to his mother, 
with a dim sense of their usefulness in providing 
an outlet for her superfluous sympathies. Boston 
women must always have an outlet. His mother 
kept herself supplied with several. He thought, 
as he sat in the phaeton waiting for this unusual 
young lady to exchange the society of the Baileys 
for his own, that she possessed a power which was 
far more masculine than feminine, of absorption in 
the immediate task. He thought it would go hard 
with a man to haunt her. She would shake him off 
for what she called objects in life, as a fine spaniel 
shakes off the drops after a plunge into the sea ; 
earth is his element, after all. 

Bob Bailey had cut one of the femoral muscles 
on a mowing-machine. The doctor etherized him, 
and sewed the leg up, enthusiastically. The odor 
of the ether permeated the fresh morning, and 
Yorke sickened over it in the phaeton. She came 
out presently, with that cool, scientific eye which 
Stimulated more than it defied him.
