denly broke out. ' Why don't you say it at once, and give 
me a chance to contradict it ? I oughtn't to care, but I 
do care ! ' 



 

' Stop, stop don't let us fight ! ' Hyacinth spoke in a 
tone of pleading weariness ; she had never heard just that 
accent before. 

Millicent considered a moment. ' I've a mind to play 
her false. - She's a real lady, highly connected, and the 
best friend I have I don't count men.' the girl interpolated, 
smiling ' and there isn't one in the world I'd do such a 
thing for but you.' 

' No, keep your promise ; don't play any one false,' said 
Hyacinth. 

' Well, you are a gentleman ! ' Miss Henning murmured, 
with a sweetness that her voice occasionally took. 

' Especially ' Hyacinth began ; but he suddenly 
stopped. 

' Especially what ? Something impudent, I'll engage ! 
Especially as you don't believe me ? ' 

' Oh, no ! Don't let's fight ! ' he repeated. 

' Fight, my darling ? I'd fight for you ! ' Miss Henning 
declared. 

Hyacinth offered himself, after tea, the choice between 
a visit to Lady Aurora and a pilgrimage to Lisson Grove. 
He was in a little doubt about the former experiment, hav- 
ing an idea that her ladyship's family might have returned 
to Belgrave Square. He reflected, however, that he could 
not recognise that as a reason for not going to see her \ his 
relations with her were not clandestine, and she had given 
him the kindest general invitation. If her august progeni- 
tors were at home she was probably at dinner with them ; 
he would take that risk. He had taken it before, without 
disastrous results. He was determined not to spend the 
evening alone, and he would keep the Poupins as a more 



substantial alternative, in case her ladyship should not be 
able to receive him. 

As soon as the great portal in Belgrave Square was 
drawn open before him, he perceived that the house was 
occupied and animated if the latter term might properly 
be applied to a place which had hitherto given Hyacinth 
the impression of a magnificent mausoleum. It was per- 
vaded by subdued light and tall domestics; Hyacinth 
found himself looking down a kind of colonnade of colossal 
footmen, an array more imposing even than the retinue of 
the Princess at Medley. His inquiry died away on his 
lips, and he stood there struggling with dumbness. It was 
manifest to him that some high festival was taking place, 
at which his presence could only be deeply irrelevant ; and 
when a large official, out of livery, bending over him for a 
voice that faltered, suggested, ' not unencouragingly, that it 
might be Lady Aurora he wished to see, he replied in a 
low, melancholy accent, 'Yes, yes, but it can't be possible !' 
The butler took no pains to controvert this proposition 
verbally ; he merely turned round, with a majestic air of 
leading the way, and as at the same moment two of the 
footmen closed the wings of the door behind the visitor, 
Hyacinth judged that it was his cue to follow him. In 
this manner, after traversing a passage where, in the perfect 
silence of the servants, he heard the shorter click of his 
plebeian shoes upon a marble floor, he found himself 
ushered into a small apartment, lighted by a veiled lamp, 
which, when he had been left there alone, without further 
remark on the part of his conductor, he recognised as the
