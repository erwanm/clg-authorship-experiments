the theatre and that sort of thing, why shouldn't you have 
it now?' 

This time Sholto's white pupils looked strange again. 
''You have it now, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid it doesn't 
follow that you'll have it a year hence. She was tired of 
me then, and of course she's still more tired of me now, 
for the simple reason that I'm more tiresome. She has 
sent me to Coventry, and I want to come out for a few 
hours. See how conscientious I am I won't pass the gates.' 

' I'll tell her I met you,' said Hyacinth. Then, irrelev- 
antly, he added, ' Is that what you mean by her having no 
heart ? ' 

' Her treating me as she treats me ? Oh, dear, no ; 
her treating you ! ' 

This had a portentous sound, but it did not prevent 
Hyacinth from turning round with his visitor (for it was the 
greatest part of the oddity of the present meeting that the 
hope of a little conversation with him, if accident were 
favourable, had been the motive not only of Sholto's riding 
over to Medley but of his coming down to stay, in the 
neighbourhood, at a musty inn in a dull market-town), it 
did not prevent him, I say, from bearing the Captain com- 
pany for a mile on his backward way. Our young man did 
not pursue this particular topic much further, but he dis- 
covered still another reason or two for admiring the light, 
free action with which his companion had unmasked himself, 
and the nature of his interest in the revolutionary idea, 


after he had asked him, abruptly, what he had had in his 
head when he travelled over that evening, the summer 
before (he didn't appear to have come back as often as 
he promised), to Paul Muniment's place in Camberwell. 
What was he looking for, whom was he looking for, there ? 

' I was looking for anything that would turn up, that 
might take her fancy. Don't you understand that I'm 
always looking? There was a time when I went in 
immensely for illuminated missals, and another when I 
collected horrible ghost-stories (she wanted to cultivate a 
belief in ghosts), all for her. The day I saw she was 
turning her attention to the rising democracy I began to 
collect little democrats. That's how I collected you.' 

' Muniment read you exactly, then. And what did you 
find to your purpose in Audley Court ? ' 

' Well, I think the little woman with the popping eyes 
she reminded me of a bedridden grasshopper will do. 
And I made a note of the other one, the old virgin with 
the high nose, the aristocratic sister of mercy. I'm keeping 
them in reserve for my next propitiatory offering.' 

Hyacinth was silent a moment. ' And Muniment him- 
self can't you do anything with him ? ' 

' Oh, my dear fellow, after you he's poor ! ' 

'That's the first stupid thing you have said. But it 
doesn't matter, for he dislikes the Princess what he knows 
of her too much ever to consent to see her.' 

' That's his line, is it ? Then he'll do ! ' Sholto cried.

' OF course he may come, and stay as long as he likes ! ' 
the Princess exclaimed, when Hyacinth, that afternoon, told 
her of his encounter, with the sweet, bright surprise her face 
always wore when people went through the form (super- 
erogatory she apparently meant to declare it) of asking her 
leave. From the manner in which she granted Sholto's 
petition with a geniality that made light of it, as if the 
question were not worth talking of, one way or the other
