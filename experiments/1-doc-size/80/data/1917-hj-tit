Up in the sick man's room the case was quite 
other; she had been admitted there but three 
times, very briefly, and a week had elapsed since 
the last, yet she had created in him a positive 
want to communicate, or at any rate to receive 
communication. She shouldn't see him again â€” 
the pair of doctors and the trio of nurses had been 
at one about that; but he had caused her to be 
told that he liked to know of her coming and 
hoped she would make herself quite at home. 
This she took for an intended sign, a hint that 
what she had in spite of difficulties managed to 
say now kept him company in the great bedimmed 

 



 

and disinfected room from which other society 
was banished. Her father in fine he ignored after 
that not particularly beautiful moment of bare 
recognition brought about by her at the bedside; 
her father was the last thing in the world that actually concerned him. But his not ignoring herself could but have a positive meaning; which 
was that she had made the impression she sought. 
Only would Graham Fielder arrive in time ? She 
was not in a position to ask for news of him, but 
was sure each morning that if there had been any 
gage of this Miss Mumby, the most sympathetic 
of the nurses and with whom she had established 
a working intelligence, would be sufficiently interested to come out and speak to her. After waiting a while, however, she recognised that 
there could be no Miss Mumby yet and went 
over to her father in the great porch. 

"Don't you get tired," she put to him, "of 
just sitting round here?" 

He turned to her his,small neat finely-wrinkled 
face, of an extreme yellowish pallor and which 
somehow suggested at this end of time an empty 
glass that had yet held for years so much strong 
wine that a faint golden tinge still lingered on 
 from it. " I can't get any more tired than I am 
already." His tone was flat, weak and so little 
charged with petulance that it betrayed the long 
habit of an almost exasperating mildness. This 
effect, at the same time, so far from suggesting 





 

any positive tradition of civility was somehow 
that of a commonness instantly and peculiarly 
exposed. "It's a better place than ours," he 
added in a moment. "But I don't care." And 
then he went on: "I guess I'd be more tired in 
your position." 

"Oh you know I'm never tired. And now," 
said Rosanna, "I'm too interested." 

"Well then, so am I. Only for me it ain't a 
position." 

His daughter still hovered with her vague look 
about. "Well, if it's one for me I feel it's a good 
one. I mean it's the right one." 

Mr. Gaw shook his little foot with renewed 
intensity, but his irony was not gay. "The right 
one isn't always a good one. But ain't the ques- 
tion what his is going to be ? " 

"Mr. Fielder's? Why, of course," said Ro- 
sanna quietly. "That's the whole interest."
