Bartlett: "Well, take that little sin on your 
conscience, if you can. It seems to me too ghastly 
that I should know what you 've told me ; it 's in- 
decent. Cummings," after another pause, 
" how does a man go about such a thing ? How 
does he contrive to tell the woman whose heart he 
has won that he doesn't care for her, and break 
the faith that she would have staked her life on ? 
Oh, I know, women do such things, too ; but 
it 's different, by a whole world's difference. A 
man comes and a man goes, but a woman stays. 
The world is before him after that happens, and 
we don't think him much of a man if he can't get 
over it. But she, she has been sought out ; she 
has been made to believe that her smile and her 
looks are heaven, poor, foolish, helpless idol ! her 



 

fears have been laid, all her pretty maidenly tradi- 
tions, her proud reserves overcome ; she takes him 
into her inmost soul, to find that his love is a 
lie, a lie ! Imagine it ! She can't do anything. 
She can't speak. She can't move as long as she 
lives. She must stay where she has been left, and 
look and act as if nothing had happened. Oh, 
good Heaven ! And I, I look like a man who 
could do that ! " After a silence : " I feel as if 
there were blood on me ! " He goes to the piano, 
and gathering up his things turns about towards 
Cummings again : " Come, man ; I 'm going. It 's 
sacrilege to stay an instant, to exist." 

Cummings : " Don't take it in that way, Bart- 
lett. I blame myself very much for not having 
spared you in what I said. I wouldn't have told 
you of it, if I could have supposed that an acci- 
dental resemblance of the sort would distress you 
so." 

Bartlett, contritely: "You had to tell me. I 
forced you to extreme measures. I 'in quite worthy to look like him. Good Lord ! I suppose I 
should be capable of his work." He moves to- 



 

wards the door with his burden, but before he 
reaches it General Wyatt, from the corridor, meets 
him with an air of confused agitation. Bartlett 
halts awkwardly, and some of the things slip from 
his hold to the floor. 



VII. 
GENERAL WYATT, CUMMINGS, and BARTLETT. 

General Wyatt : " Sir, I am glad to see you." 
He pronounces the civility with a manner evi- 
dently affected by the effort to reconcile Bartlett's 
offensive personal appearance with his own sense 
of duty. "I I was sorry to miss you before ; 
and now I wish Your friend " referring with 
an inquiring glance to Cummings " has explained 
to you the cause of our very extraordinary behav- 
ior, and I hope you " 

Bartlett : " Mr. Cummings has told me that I 
have the misfortune to resemble some one with 
whom you have painful associations. That is quite 
enough and entirely justifies you. I am going at 
once, and I trust you will forgive my rudeness 
in absenting myself a moment ago. I have a bad 
temper ; but I never could forgive myself if I had
