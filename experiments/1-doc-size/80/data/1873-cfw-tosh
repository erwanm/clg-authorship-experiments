almost too much happiness." 

Aunt Faith possessed a fund of native humor 



 

which neither age nor care had been able to 
subdue. As her niece rose to go to her room, 
she said with a merry glance, " By the way, 
Sibyl, how about the smell of the flannels from 
the kitchen on washing-days ? " 

" I will have them washed at the extreme end 
of the back garden," replied Sibyl, echoing 
Aunt Faith's laugh, as she escaped from the 
room. 

The thirty-first of August came, — Hugh's last 
day at home. His departure was hastened by 
his wish to return to Sibyl's wedding ; he hoped 
to get initiated into the duties of his new posi- 
tion, conquer the first difficulties, and gain a few 

 days of leisure for a short visit home before the 
busy winter season commenced. Mr. Hastings, 
the second-cousin who had offered Hugh a place 
in his counting-room, was a New- York mer- 
chant, a stern, practical man, who expected full 
measure of work from all his subordinates. 
Yet, with all his rigor, he had a kind heart in 
his breast, and was inclined to treat his young 



 

relative with favor ; he had seen him but once, 
when, during school-life, Hugh had spent a va- 
cation at his house ; but the old man had been 
more pleased than he would acknowledge, with 
the boy's overflowing spirits and bright intellect. 
He had no sons; his daughters were married, and 
the next year he had written to Aunt Faith pro- 
posing to take Hugh into his business on the 
completion of his education, promising, if the 
young man stood the test well, that he would 
give him a small share of the profits after a 
certain period, and intimating that there would 
be no bar to his becoming a partner eventually, 
if he showed the proper qualifications. The 
business men among Aunt Faith's acquaintances 
told her that this was a fine opening for Hugh, 
that the house of J. B. Hastings & Co. stood 
well in New York, and that they would gladly 
accept such an opportunity for their sons. 
Hugh himself was pleased with the idea, and 
when it was finally decided that he should go, 
he wrote a letter full of enthusiastic thanks and 




hopes to Mr. Hastings, and finished his remain- 
ing two years at college with many pleasant 
visions of his future life floating in his brain. 

'' Tis the last day of summer, left blooming 
alone," chanted Tom, as he entered the dining- 
room where the rest of the family were at 
breakfast. " To-morrow Hugh will be gone, — 
to-morrow Estella Camilla Wales must pine in 
vain for her mistress, who will be engrossed in 
decimal fractions, and to-morrow I must take 
down from the dusty shelf that dismal old 
Latin Prose. I wonder who cares for 
Romulus and Remus! I don't ! " 

" Don't talk about it beforehand," said Gem ;
