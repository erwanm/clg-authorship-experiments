I'd rather stay at home, and help you," she cried, " and 
study some, as I get a chance. But oh, Miss Madeira, if 
Captain Mullins thought he could it would cost a good 
deal, I suppose, but it would make me so happy ; " and her 
soft, dark eyes were all aglow with hope. 

" What is it, my dear ? " 

" If I could take lessons in music ! Madame Felix 
would teach me, and it would be so delightful. Some- 
times I take the babies in, and she plays for me and sings. 
I can't tell how it is, only I seem then to remember some- 
thing about my own mamma. And she thinks I could 
learn so easily." 

" I wonder if it would be good judgment ? " said Miss 
Madeira, thoughtfully. "If you could learn enough to 
teach ; but there'd be the piano, and they cost a mint of 
money, not but what you deserve it all, and more, 
and maybe the captain'd want a piano for Moppet and 
Cissy, though why people shouldn't have good Christian 
names, and be called by them, puzzles me. Sister used to 
think Bible names so dreadful, and I can't say that Bath- 
sheba is an easy one to call, but Daphne and Psyche don't 
better the matter any, to my thinking. And Mullins, 
somehow, seems so plain a name to tack all the others 
to." 

Queenie laughed a little. Captain Mullins liked the fan- 
ciful names bestowed by his wife so little, indeed, that he 
never used them. If the children had not been christened 
he would certainly have suggested that Miss Madeira re- 
name them to her liking. 

The music plan was mentioned, and Captain Mullins 
assented most cordially, though he could hardly give up 
the school. Madame Felix lived at the end of the block, 
kept house in a simple, half French, fashion in three rooms, 
supporting herself and her blind, invalid husband, a 
email, dark, plain woman, who had taken a great fancy to 





the sunny-haired girl, and asked her in now and then of 
an evening. 

Miss Madeira went to call with Queenie. Madame 
Felix received them cordially, and spoke with a pretty 
accent that made you forget her plainness. She would be 
delighted to take the little girl ; she knew her so well 
already, and she had a musical face, musical hands, too. 
And if she would come in the evening, for madame had 
all the day engagements that she could attend to. 

Queenie was wild with delight. And then Captain 
Mullens had to go away, much to his sorrow, for he had 
never so enjoyed his home. Moppet was inconsolable, 
and made so much trouble that Miss Madeira was at her 
wits' end ; but then school began, which created quite a 
diversion, and quieted the house wonderfully. 

Two evenings a week Queenie spent with her new 
friend, Madame Felix. She always gave the babies their 
supper, and put them to bed ; indeed, Miss Maderia was 
helpless as a baby herself when it came to managing them. 
But when Queenie took them in hand they generally 
yielded at once, allowed their hands and faces to be 
washed, and trotted up-stairs in the wake of their small 
mistress, whose rule was of the gentlest. If they were 
very bad she would not sit by the crib and sing, but go 
down at once. When they saw her golden head vanish- 
ing from the door-way, they gave in, and cried out, " Polly 
will be dood ! " Tassy will be dood ! " and then Queenie 
would run back smiling, and kiss their little red lips. 

There had been one quite serious mutiny with the 
older ones after their father's departure. Pug and Moppet
