the hideous attraction of despair. Even the recol- 
lections of a first love were veiled by what he 
understood to be the irrevocable interdiction of the 
Church, and, in his strongly spiritual mood, to thiuk 
of Beatrix appeared to him like a temptation to 
mortal sin. 

In leaving England, without any definite aim, but 
with a vague intention of making his way to Jeru- 



 

salem, he had obeyed the Abbot of Sheering rather 
than followed friendly advice, and his obedience 
had savoured strongly of the monastic rule. Lam- 
bert de Clare, a man of the world before he had be- 
come a churchman, and a man of heart before he was 
a ruler of monks, had understood Gilbert's state well 
enough, and had forced the best remedy upon him. 
The cure for a broken heart, if there be any, is not in 
solitude and prayer, but in facing the wounds and stings 
of the world's life ; and the abbot had almost forcibly 
thrust his young friend out to live like other men of 
his order, while suggesting a pilgrimage to the Holy 
Land as a means of satisfying his religious cravings. 
As for the material help which Gilbert had re- 
ceived, it was no shame, in an age not sordid, for a 
penniless gentleman to accept both gifts and money 
from a rich and powerful person like the Abbot of 
Sheering, in the certainty of carving out such fortune 
with his own hands as should enable him amply to 
repay the loan. So far as his immediate destination 
was concerned, the abbot, who considered his house 
to be vastly superior to political dissension, and 
secretly laughed at his cousins for supporting King 
Stephen's upstart cause, had advised Gilbert to make 
his way directly to the court of Geoffrey Plantagenet, 
Duke of Normandy, and Grand Seneschal of France, 
the husband of the Empress Maud, rightful Queen of 
England. Thither he was riding, therefore, with 
Dunstan on his left hand, mounted upon his second 
horse, while Alric, the sturdy little Saxon groom and 
archer, rode behind them on a stout mule laden with 
Gilbert's possessions. 



CHAPTER VI 

Those were the early days of Geoffrey's lordsMp 
in Normandy. Twice and three times he came 
up from Anjou with his men-at-arms and his foot- 
men to take possession of his wife's lawful inherit- 
ance. Again and again he was repulsed and driven 
back to his own dominions, but at the last he pre- 
vailed, and the iron will of the man whose royal race 
was to give England fourteen kings, forced Normandy 
to submission, and thereafter he ruled in peace. Yet 
he was not so strongly established but that he desired 
sound friendships and strong alliances to support him, 
and at the same time he was anxious to obtain help 
for his wife in her prolonged struggle for the English 
crown. In his office of Grand Seneschal of France 
he generally caused himself to be represented by a 
deputy ; but he had lately determined to make a 
journey to Paris, in the hope of ivinning over the 
young King Louis, and perhaps the beautiful Queen 
Eleanor, who was feudal sovereign, in her own right, 
of Guienne, Poitou and Aquitaine, and in reality a 
more powerful personage than the King himself. 

So it fell out that before Gilbert reached his 
destination he met a great and splendid train riding 
toward him on the highroad, two hundred horse, at 
the very least, and as many footmen, followed by a 
long line of sumpter mules. The road was narrow at
