Corona herself looked up from her game with little Orsino, 
nodded and uttered a word of recognition, and then returned 
to her occupation. 

Conversation under these circumstances was manifestly 
impossible, and Gouache wished he had not had the unlucky 
idea of calling. There was nothing to be done, however, but 
to put on a brave face and make the best of it. 

' Well, Monsieur Gouache,' inquired the old prince, ' and 
how did you spend the night ? ' 

He could scarcely have asked a question better calculated 
to disturb the composure of every one present except the baby. 
Anastase could not help looking at Corona, who looked 
instinctively at her husband, while the latter gazed at 
Gouache, wondering what he would say. All three turned a 
shade paler, and during a very few seconds there was an awk 
ward silence. 

' I spent the night very uncomfortably,' replied Anastase, 
after hesitating a little. ' We were driven from pillar to post, 
repelling attacks, doing sentry duty, clearing the streets, 
marching and countermarching. It was daylight when I was 
relieved.' 




' Indeed ! ' exclaimed Sant' Ilario. ' I had supposed that 
you had remained all night at the Porta San Paolo. But 
there are many contradictory accounts. I was in some 
anxiety until I was assured that you had not been blown up 
in that infernal plot.' 

Gouache was on the point of asking who had told 
Giovanni that he had escaped, but fortunately checked him 
self, and endeavoured to turn the conversation to the disaster 
at the barracks. Thereupon old Saracinesca, whose blood 
was roused by the atrocity, delivered a terrible anathema 
against the murderous wretches who had ruined the building, 
and expressed himself in favour of burning them alive, a fate, 
indeed, far too good for them. Anastase profited by the old 
gentleman's eloquence to make advances to the baby. Little 
Orsino, however, struck him a vigorous blow in the face with 
his tiny fist and yelled lustily. 

' He does not like strangers,' remarked Corona, coldly. 
She rose with the child in her arms and moved towards the 
door, Gouache following her with the intention of opening it 
for her to go out. The prince was still thundering out curses 
against the conspirators, and Anastase attempted to say a 
word unobserved as Corona passed him. 

' Will you not give me a hearing ? ' he asked in a low 
tone, accompanying his words with an imploring look. 

Corona raised her eyebrows slightly as though surprised, 
but his expression of genuine contrition softened her heart 
a little and rendered her answer perhaps a trifle less unkind 
than she had meant it to be. 

' You should be satisfied since I keep your secret,' she 
said, and passed quickly out. 

When Gouache turned after closing the door he was 
aware that Sant' Ilario had been watching him, by the fixed 
way in which he was now looking in another direction. The 
Zouave wished more and more fervently that he had not 
come to the house, but resolved to prolong his visit in the 
hope that Corona might return. Sant' Ilario was unaccount 
ably silent, but his father kept up a lively conversation, 
needing only an occasional remark from Gouache to give a 
fillip to his eloquence. 




This situation continued during nearly half an hour, at 
the end of which time Anastase gave up all hope of seeing
