" She is a great deal better now. When we first 
knew her, she couldn't walk but a few steps. She 
was in the hospital where my brother used to go 
when he was first a doctor. Then she came to live 
in our street." 

"With her parents? " 

" Oh, yes. She has one aunt, but no brothers 
or sisters. It must seem strange not to have any," 
and Hanny glanced up. 

" It would be strange to me. I had ten in all, 
and there is only one dead. Eugene is the oldest 
of the second family. One married brother lives 
in Baltimore, one only a short distance from here. 
And you have six brothers, a good supply for 
one little girl." 

" I suppose some of them belong to Margaret," 
and she gave a soft, rippling laugh. " We haven't 
ever divided them up. But Joe belongs to me. 
When I get to be a woman, and he has a good big 
practice, I am going to keep house for him." 

" But what will your father do? ' 

"Why ' Hanny had not considered that 
point. " Oh, it won't be in a long while ! And 
then father will be old, and he will come and live 
with us, I think. Dolly says she is going to have 
mother." 

Airs. French thought the division rather amus- 



ing. 





Where is Captain French gone now? ' 
" To China again. He has been going back and 
forth to Liverpool ; but he had an excellent offer for 





the long trip. I concluded not to go, grandpa was 
so old and feeble. And my sister is coming to 
England to live. Her husband is heir now to a 
fine estate and a title ; and they have quite a family 
of children." 

" Then you will want to go to England to see 
her," said Hanny. 

" Indeed, I shall. I have not seen her in seven 
years ; since the time she was here." 

" We all liked Mr. Eugene so much," Hanny 
remarked. " And Luella has grown so, I hardly 
knew her." 

" They have a trick of growing up. I hope you 
won't be in any hurry." 

" I am small of my age/' and Hanny gave a 
soft sigh. 

" It will take you a long time to get as large as 
your mother." 

Hanny wasn't sure that she wanted to be quite 
so large. Yet she didn't really want her mothef 
changed. And, oh, she wouldn't have her as thin 
as Mrs. Reed for all the world !
