stand things ! That would come to think and to will ! 
That would be a man ! 

"Is it is it all right?" he asked the nurse, in a 
trembling whisper. 

"It's a magnificent boy," she said. And then she 
struck a match, and held the light in front of its eyes ; 



 

and the eyes turned to follow the light. "He sees !" 
she said. 

Yes, he could see! And Thyrsis had already heard 
that he could speak ! What could it not do this mar- 
vellous object! It was Nature's supreme miracle it 
was the answer to all the riddles, the solution of all the 
mysteries ! It was a vindication of the subterfuges, a 
reward for the sacrifices, a balm for the pain ! It was 
the thing for which all the rest had been, it was the 
crown and consummation of their love it was Life's 
supreme shout of triumph and exultation ! 

The nurse was holding the child up before Cory- 
don ; and she was gazing at it, she was feeding her eyes 
upon it. And oh, the smile that came upon her face
the ineffable smile ! The pride, and the relief, and 
the beatific happiness ! This thing she had done it 
was her act of creation ! Her battle that had been 
fought, her victory that had been won ; and now they 
brought her the crown and the guerdon ! To Thyrsis 
there came suddenly the words of Jesus : "A woman 
when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour 
hath come ; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, 
she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a 
man is born into the world." And he sunk down beside 
the bed, and caught the woman's hand in his, and began 
to sob softly to himself. 

12. LATER on he went into the street. Evening 
was come again for twenty-two hours that siege had 
lasted ! And the boy had eaten nothing since noon of 
the day before, and he was weak and dizzy. 

But how strange the world seemed to him all at 
once ! Peopled with, phantom creatures, that came he 
knew not whence, and went he knew not whither ! Crea- 



 

tures of awe and horror, who came out of chaos, and 
went back into annihilation ! Who were flung here and 
there by cosmic forces, played with by tragic destinies ! 
And all of them without any sense of the perpetual 
marvel of their own being! They ate and dressed and 
slept, they laughed and played and worked, they hated 
and loved and got and spent, with no thought of the 
wonder of their lightest breath, with no sense of the 
terrors that ringed them about the storms that swept 
them hither and thither, the million miracles that were 
wrought for them every instant of their lives ! 

He went into a restaurant, and sat down ; and in the 
seat beside him, close at his elbow, was a man. He was 
a fat man eating roast pork, and apple-sauce, and 
mashed potatoes, and bread. And Thyrsis looked at 
him with wondering eyes. "Man," he imagined himself 
saying, "do you know how you came into this world? 
A thing impish, demoniac purple and dripping with 
blood a spectre of nightmare dreams?" 

"W-what?" the man gasped. 

"And you know nothing of the pain that it cost! 
You have no sense of the strangeness of it ! You never
