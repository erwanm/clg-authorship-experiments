a boy's eager desire, at times, to take her off to the fairy 
isles of love's first dreams, _ where they two might be 
alone together. He never told even her of this nonsen 
sical idea ; but it always gave him a mood of special 
indulgence. 

"Yes, I will tell you. I ought to be a rich man for 
your sake." 

' ' Why ? I have never had riches ; ' ' and she gave him 
her most winsome smile. " I do not care much, I think. 
Only there are a few things that will make the place more 
homelike." 

" The bay-window, for instance. Is it to be in the 
parlor?" 

Then she began with her plans, which he declared 
excellent, and quite within his means. 

"Adelaide will go somewhere jn August, and take 
Maud with her : she always does. Then we will com 
mence repairs and alterations." 

Neither spoke of new furnishing ; but it was strongly 
in the doctor's mind, and, along with it, the compunction 
of uprooting old ties and memories. If he had been 
happy in them ; but every day he felt more and more 
how utterly barren that life had proved. And that gave 
him a peculiar tenderness, the desire to do his duty 
justly and honorably when there was no love to inspire 
it. 

He made his calls, a long distance apart they were 
this afternoon, and then they reached a lovely little 
nook, sheltered by a high peak on one side, with a cluster 
of twenty or thirty cottages at its foot. Up on the moun 
tain-top was a spring that trickled over a rocky bed, 
broken many places in its descent, but at the last falling 
some fifteen feet. It caught the rays of the setting sun 
 

through an opening in the trees, and gave back the most 
exquisite rainbow tints. All the banks were lined with 
rhododendron, now in its fullest bloom ; and it seemed 
to Nelly that she had never seen any thing so enchant- 
ingly beautiful. The work^was done ; and they lingered 
in the sunset, watching the orange-red as it faded into 
rose and violet. A quiet summer evening was coming 
slowly on, calm, like all the utterances of God. Why 
was -it that souls drifted away from him, trying to find 
peace for themselves, when it was freely offered at his 
hands ? 

They were late home, of course. Miss Grove was 
nowhere to be seen, Mrs. Kinnard was fretful, Jane sul 
len, as she brought in some hot tea. Without a word, 
Nelly cleared a little space at the head of the table, 
brought up her husband's plate and two or three dishes. 

"Sit here by me," she said in a quiet but tender 
tone, waiting upon him with the grace that had so won 
him in the quaint rectory. 

" She can twist him round her finger," muttered Jane ; 
"but she shall see that she cannot rule everybody else. 
I am glad Miss Adelaide has a little spirit ! " 

And Jane tossed her head, as if she might use hers on 
the very first occasion.
