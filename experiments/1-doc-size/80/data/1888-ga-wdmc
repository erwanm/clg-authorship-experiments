rest of the old boys. We will saturate our minds 
with their rhythm, and we will thereafter
communicate in stately phrase and rolling periods." 

" It would be a great deal better than slang 
and 'facetiousness,' as you call it. That is all 
very well for Lord Bective Hollington; it suits 
him; but you should aim at a higher standard." 

Dartmouth, who was standing by the chimney- 
piece near the chair on which she was sitting, 
put his hand under her chin and raised her face, 
smiling quizzically as he did so. 

" My dear child," he said, "you are too clever 
to fall into the common error of women, and 
idealize your lover. The tendency is a 
constituent part of the feminine nature, it is true. The 
average woman will idealize the old tweed coat 
on her lover's back. But your eyes are too clear 
for that sort of thing. I am a very ordinary 
young man, my dear. Becky is twice as clever — " 



 

" He is not! " burst in Weir, indignantly. "A 
man who can do nothing but chaff and joke and 
"talk witty nonsense! " 

" If you knew him better you would know that 
under all that persiflage there is much depth of 
feeling and passion. I do not claim any unusual 
amount of intellectuality for him, but he has a 
wonderful supply of hard common-sense, and 
remarkably quick perceptions. And I have great 
respect for his judgment." 

"That may be," said Weir, indifferently; "I 
care nothing about him." She rose and stood 
in front of him and leaned her elbows on his 
shoulders. " You may underrate yourself, if you 
like," she went on, "but I know that you are 
capable of accomplishing anything you wish, and 
of distinguishing yourself. I recall the 
conversations I have had with you in your serious 
moments, if you do not, and I expect you to be a 
great man yet." 

Dartmouth flung his cigar impatiently into the 
fire. " My dear girl, my grandmother preached 
that same thing to me from the day I was old 
enough to reason, to the day she died. But I 
tell you. Weir, I have not got it in me. I have 
the ambition and the desire — yes; but no marked 
ability of any sort. Some day, when we are 
ready to settle down, I will write, and publish 
what I write. Men will grant me a certain 
standing as a thinker, I believe, and perhaps they will 



 

also give me credit for a certain nice use of 
words; I have made a study of literary style all 
my life. But that is the most I shall ever attain. 
I am not a man of any genius or originality, and 
you may as well make up your mind to the inev- 
itable at once." 

" Harold," said Weir, without taking the 
slightest notice of his outburst, " do you 
remember that extraordinary experience of yours that 
night in Paris ? I believe you have the soul of 
a poet in you, only as yet your brain hasn't got 
it under control. Did you ever read the life of 
Alfieri ? He experienced the same desire to 
write, over and over again, but could accomplish
