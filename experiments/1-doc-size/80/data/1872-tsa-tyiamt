the yell of a wild beast than anything else. I sat 
motionless and breathless, listening intently. I could 
hear voices as of two or three men under strong ex 
citement and the noise of violent struggling. 

All then grew still so still that I could hear my 
watch ticking in my pocket. My forehead was damp 
with sweat ; my hands were cold and clammy ; I felt 
as weak as a child. I sat on the bed for two or three 
minutes, hearkening, but the silence was unbroken. 
Then, exhausted, as one after a long and severe 
effort, I fell back again upon the bed. But scarcely 



  

had my head touched the pillow when a wail of an 
guish smote my ears that it is impossible to describe. 
Only the extremest torture could have wrung such 
a cry from mortal lips. It was a mingling of terror 
and pain wrought up to their intensest expression. 
Then, as I listened with keenest attention, I could 
hear curses and words of deprecation and pleading, 
followed by renewed cries of agony. 

I could bear it no longer, and so thrust my fingers 
into my ears to keep out the fearful sounds. But 
whenever I removed them, the dreadful cries would 
be heard. So it went on, with brief pauses, for nearly 
two hours, the strain on my nerves becoming so great 
that I felt sick and faint. Between five and six o clock 
I heard a rumbling, as of a light wagon coming along 
the corridor. It stopped every little while, and then 
came on again, drawing nearer and nearer. At last 
it was opposite my cell. I looked toward the door 
and saw a little square place near the top drawn open 
outward, and then a small tin basin containing some 
liquid, which I found to be chocolate, and a piece of 
bread, were pushed in through the opening. 

I came forward and took them, saying as I did 
so, 

" For Heaven 's sake, what 's the matter over there ?" 

" Purgatory got the rams," was the brief answer, 
and the little opening was shut with a sharp click. 

I put the basin of chocolate and piece of bread on 
the table and sat down. " Purgatory got the rams !" 
I said, taking a deep shuddering breath as the truth 



 

dawned upon my mind. I understood now the 
meaning of those dreadful cries. 

" Take them to purgatory," had been said of the 
two men with mania-a-potu as they were taken from 
the prison-van, and it was no doubt the horrible 
ravings and struggles of one or both of them that I 
had heard. " Purgatory !" Well might the chamber 
of despair in which were thrust the poor wretches 
assaulted by rum demons be called " purgatory !" 

I was sick at heart. By this time the wails and 
shrieks from across the corridor had ceased, the un 
happy maniacs having been drugged into quietude, 
perhaps stupor. 

My supper of weak chocolate and dry bread re 
mained untasted. It would have taken daintier food 
than that to tempt my appetite. 

As the darkness came on and I sat lonely and de 
pressed in my cell, a few faint rays of light creeping 
in through a small opening from the corridor, a troop
