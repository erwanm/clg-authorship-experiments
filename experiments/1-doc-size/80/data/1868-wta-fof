For two months uncle Nathan had kept four thousand dollars in gold in
the house, groaning at the loss of sixty-six and two thirds cents a day
in interest; but a bank somewhere in the state had failed, and he dared
not trust the money out of his own possession. It had been hidden in
the cellar, hidden in the parlor, hidden in the kitchen, and hidden in
his chamber; but no place seemed to be safe, and the miser trembled
when awake, and trembled when asleep, in his dreams, lest the
figurative description of riches should be realized, and his gold
should take to itself wings and fly away.

Ruin and decay had invaded the sleeping-room of the miser, as it had
every other part of his house. There was many a hole in the plastering,
and many a hole in the floor; but there was one particular hole in the
wall, about a foot above the floor, in a corner behind the bed. This
particular hole was selected as the receptacle for the gold. He had cut
away the laths, so that he could thrust his arm down into the aperture,
and deposit the bag on the sill of the house.

He had begged a piece of board of Mr. Mogmore to cover this hole, and
had fastened it over the plastering with four screws. While he was thus
engaged, Mat Mogmore, the carpenter's son, had come for the
screw-driver uncle Nathan had borrowed at the shop. Mrs. Fairfield, not
knowing what her husband was doing, sent him into the chamber for it.

"Stoppin' up the cracks to keep the cold out," whined the miser. "I
cal'late I got the rheumatiz out of this hole."

Mat wanted the screw-driver, but he helped fasten up the board before
he took it, and wondered what the old man had cut away the laths for.
The board was put up, and the money was safe; but the miser hardly
dared to go out of sight of the house.




CHAPTER II.

FIRE.


Levi entered the house. Uncle Nathan was not at home, but he was
probably somewhere in the vicinity. Aunt Susan was in the kitchen
baking her weekly batch of brown bread, the staple article of food in
the family, because it was cheaper than white bread.

"Aunt, I want to go up in the garret and get that little saw-mill I
made four or five years ago," said Levi.

"Well, I s'pose you can," replied she, filling up the old brick oven
with pine wood, which cracked and snapped furiously in the fierce
flames.

"It's up there now--isn't it?"

"I s'pose 'tis, if you put it there; I hain't teched it."

"Will you give me a little piece of candle, too, if you please?"

"You can take that piece in the candlestick on the mantel-tree piece,
if it's long enough."

"That will do just as well as if it were a foot long," replied Levi,
taking the piece of candle, and rolling it up in a bit of newspaper.

He went up into the attic, found the saw-mill just as he had left it,
though it was covered with half an inch of dust and cobwebs. When he
came down, he heard uncle Nathan's voice in the kitchen. He was
growling because his wife used so much wood to heat the oven, and Levi
concluded not to see him that day, for he seemed to be in a more than
usually unamiable frame of mind. He went out at the front door, and
Bessie joined him as he passed Mr. Mogmore's house. The saw-mill was
taken to the spot where it had stood before. The dam was reconstructed
much more readily than the rebel states.

Taking the candle from his pocket, Levi greased the running parts of
the machine, hoisted the gate, and away went the saw as briskly as a
bee after its years of rest in the attic, to the intense delight of
Bessie, who was quite ready to vote another feather for the cap of the
hero. A piece of board was adjusted on the carriage, and the saw began
