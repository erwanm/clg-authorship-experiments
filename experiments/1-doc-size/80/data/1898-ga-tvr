He would defy the governor and all his 
men. 

When Roldan made up his mind he 
acted promptly. No time was to be lost 
in this case. Now was the hour of siesta ; 
he could have no better time to get away. 
A note would relieve his parents of a 
certain amount of anxiety ; and if they did not 
know where he was they could not be held 
accountable. His blood tingled at the 
presentiment of the adventures he should 
have in that perilous journey through a 
country of which he knew nothing beyond 
his father's and the adjoining rancho. And 
as adventures would be but half spiced if 
experienced alone, he determined and 
not from selfish motives only to save 
his best beloved friend, Adan Pardo, from 
the grasp of the law likewise. 

He went within and slung about him 
self two pistols and a dagger. After he 

had made a small bundle of linen and 
raided the pantry, he went out to the 
corral, saddled his horse and packed the 
&gt;udclle bags, wound his lariat securely 
about the pommel, then galloped away 
on a series of adventures memorable in 
the annals of California. 


ROLDAN'S way lay over his father's 
leagues until two hours after night 
fall. As he passed, every now and again, 
a herd of cattle, lounging vaqueros called 
to him : " Ay, Don Roldan, where do you 
go ? " or, " The little senor chooses a hot 
day for his ride." But he excited no curi 
osity. Like all Californians he half lived 
in the saddle ; and he was often seen 
riding in the direction of Don Esteban 
Pardo's rancho, to spend a few days with 
his chosen friend. 

As he approached the house he saw the 
family sitting on the long verandah : the 
pretty black-eyed girls in full white gowns, 
their dark hair flowing to the floor, or 
braided loosely ; Don Esteban, a silk hand 
kerchief knotted about his head, reclining 
in a long chair beside his wife, a stout 
woman, coffee-coloured with age, attired 
in a dark silk gown flowered with roses. 



 

Indian servants came and went with cool 
ing drinks. Although it was December, 
Winter had loitered and fallen into deeper 
sleep than usual on her journey South this 
year. 

Adan was leaning against a pillar, moody 
and bored. He was the youngest of the 
boys. His brothers, elegant caballeros, 
who spent most of their time in the capital 
or on other ranches, were kind to their 
younger brother, but not companionable. 
Therefore, when Roldan galloped into 
sight, he gave a shout of joy and ran 
down the road. Roldan drew rein some 
distance from the house, that the 
conference, which must take place immediately, 
might be unheard by older ears. 

" Listen, my friend," he said rapidly,
