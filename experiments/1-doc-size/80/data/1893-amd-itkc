" I want some — advice, I think it is. In this 
idyllic Eden there seem no sins or temptations to 
confess, so we burden you with our indecisions," 
and she smiled. 

Was it aught concerning Chester House ? 

" You were out at Long Meadows this morn- 
ing ? " he began. 

" Yes ; Pearl and I. We indulged in a senti- 
ment of regret as we glanced over the smiling 
fields. You have heard all the plans of the new 
town, I dare say ? " 

Olmstead nodded. 

" Womanlike, we bewailed the change." 

" Well ? " breaking her long pause. 

" One can see the other side," and a serious 
expression crossed her face. " How dreary those 
long stretches of stubble must look in the winter ! 
And the houses are falling to decay. The farmers 
grumble that nothing pays any more. Most of 


 

them are glad enough to sell out at what seems a 
tortune to them. From the purely pastoral side 
it is sad to contemplate. The farmers are vapid 
and listless, obstinate, trying yet to achieve suc- 
cess with their grandfathers' methods. The wo- 
men sit in-doors, running a sewing-machine, doing 
shop-work' for the larger centres at prices that
must starve out their sisters in the cities. This 
is Pearl's wisdom and discrimination," smiling. 
" She would have them raising chickens and ber- 
ries and flowers. After all, a town of the larger 
industries may not prove detrimental. But I did 
not mean to air my newly acquired lore. You 
will soon discern the incompleteness of it." 

Whatever she said had a subtle fascination 
for Olmstead. He glanced up from the patch of 
daisies and clover at his feet. He wanted to ask 
about Chester House Farm ; but she began again, 
to his surprise : — 

" It is Miss Vasilis I want to discuss. I have 
never gone very deeply into the study of human- 
ity. I understand some people, those I have been 
generally accustomed to, and one gets vague ideas 
of the rest, — a very few of. the rest, I suppose ? 
I don't think I was at all drawn to Miss Vasilis 
at first. I had never met one like her in a famil- 
iar manner. I couldn't tell whether anything 
pleased her or not. Sometimes she was almost 



stolid. But there was a curious smouldering fire 
underneath that flared up one night. It was like 
a bit out of a poem. She was really ill, though 
I suppose one rarely reaches such conclusions in 
any sort of healthy state. I was afraid she was 
going to turn out an ingrate on Pearl's hands." 

" No, not that," he replied protestingly. 

" If she had been a little stronger she would 
have gone off, and we should never have imagined 
how the poor starved soul was hungering for 
something she had never known, and was vaguely 
dreaming of in a confused fashion. She has some 
gifts that amount to almost genius. Pearl has dis- 
covered them. She has made wonderful sketches,
