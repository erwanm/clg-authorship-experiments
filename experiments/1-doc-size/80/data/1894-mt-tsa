where that feller's credit comes in, you see ; and 
that's where mine comes in. I don't claim no great 
things ; I don't reckon I could 'a' done it again, but 
I done it that time — that's all I claim. And I hadn't 
no more idea I could do such a thing, and warn't 
any more thinking about it or trying to, than you 
be this minute. Why, I was just as cam, a body 
couldn't be any cammer, and yet all of a sudden 
out it come. I've often thought of that time, and 
I can remember just the way everything looked, 
same as if it was only last week. I can see it all : 
beautiful rolling country with woods and fields 
and lakes for hundreds and hundreds of miles all 
around, and towns and villages scattered everywheres 
under us here and there and yonder, and the professor 
mooning over a chart on his little table, and 
Tom's cap flopping in the rigging where it was hung 
up to dryv/uid one thing in particular was a bird 
right alongside, not ten foot off, going our way and 
trying to keep up, but losing ground all the time, 
and a railroad train doing the same, down there, 
sliding along amongst the trees and farms, and 
pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now 
and then a little puff of white ; and when the white 
was gone so long you had 'most forgot it, you 
would bear a little faint toot, and that was the 
whistle ; and we left the bird and the train both 
behind, 'way behind, and done it easy, too. 

But Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim 
was a couple of ignorant blatherskites, and then 
he says : 

' Suppose there's a brown calf and a big brown 
dog, and an artist is making a picture of them. 
What is the main thing that that artist has got to 
do ? He has got to paint them so you can tell 'em 
apart the minute you look at them, hain't he ? Of 
course. Well, then, do you want him to go and 
paint both of them brown ? Certainly you don't. 

He paints one of them blue, and then you can't 
make no mistake. It's just the same with the 
maps. That's why they make every State a 
different colour ; it ain't to deceive you — it's to keep 
yon from deceiving yourself.' 

But I couldn't see no argument about that, and 
neither could Jim. Jim shook his head and 
says : 

 Why, Mars Tom, of you knowed what chuckle- 
heads dem painters is, you'd wait a long time befo' 
you'd fetch one er dem in to back up a fac'. I's 
gwyne to tell you, den you kin see for you'seff. I 
see one er 'em a-paintin' away, one day, down in 
old Hank Wilson's back lot, en I went down to see, 
en he was paintin' dat old brindle cow wid de near 
horn gone — you knows de one I means. En I ast 
him what's he paintin' her for, en he say when he 
git her painted de picture's wuth a hundred dollars. 
Mars Tom, he could 'a' got de cow fer fifteen, en 
I tole him so. Well, sah, ef you'll b'lieve me, he 
jes' shuck his head en went on a-dobbin'. Bless 
you, Mars Tom, dey don't know nothin'.' 

Tom he lost his temper ; I notice a person 'most 
always does that's got laid out in an argument. 
He told us to shut up and don't stir the slush in 
our skulls any more — hold still and let it cake, and 
maybe we'd feel better. Then he see a town clock 
away off down yonder, and he took up the glass 
and looked at it, and then looked at his silver 
turnip, and then at the clock, and then at the 
turnip again, and says : 

' That's funny — that clock's near about an 
hour fast.' 

So he put up his turnip. Then he see another
