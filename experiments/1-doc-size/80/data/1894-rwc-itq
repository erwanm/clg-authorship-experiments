The Herr Forester and the two Jaegers had 
gone away. Miss Dene stood now with her 
slender hands clasped easily behind her, a Tarn. 



O Shanter shading her sweet face. She was 
tall, and so far as Mr. Blumenthal had ever 
seen, extremely grave for her years. But Mr. 
Blumenthai's opportunities of observing Miss 
Dene had been limited. 

The "gams" had disappeared. Miss Dene 
was looking down the road that leads to Schick- 
salee. There was not much visible there, except a whirl of dust raised by the sudden even 
ing wind. 

Sometimes it was swept away for a moment; 
then she saw a weather-beaten bridge, and a 
bend in the road, where it disappeared among 
the noble firs of a Bavarian forest. 

The sun sank, and left the Trauerbach a 
stream of molten lead. The shadows crept up 
to the Jaeger's hut, and then to the little chapel 
above that. Gusts of whistling martins swept by. 

A silk-lined, Paris-made wool dress rustled 
close beside her, and she put out one of the 
slender hands without turning her head. 

"Mother, dear," said she, as a little silver- 
haired old lady took it, and came and leaned 
against her tall girl's shoulder, "haven't we had 
enough of the ( F6rst-haus zu Trauerbach ?"

to your Schmarn und Reh-braten. Supper is 
ready." 

Mother and daughter walked into the dingy 
"Stube," and took their seats at the Forester's 
table. 

Mr. Blumenthal's efforts had not secured him 
a place there after all, Anna, the capable niece 
of the Frau Forster, having set down a large 
foot, clad in a thick white stocking and a carpet 
slipper, to the effect that there was only room 
for the Herr Forster's family, and the Ameri 
cans. 

"I also am an American!" cried Mr. Blu- 
menthal in Hebrew-German. Nevertheless, 
when Ruth and her mother came in he bowed 
affably to them from the nearest end of the next 
table. 

"Mamma," said Ruth, very low, "I hope 
I'm not going to begin being difficult, but, do 
you know, that is really an odious man?" 



"Yes, I do know," laughed her easy-tempered 
mother, "but what is that to us?" 

Mr. Blumenthal was reveling in hot fat. After 
he had bowed and smiled greasily, he tucked his 
napkin tighter under his chin, and fell once
