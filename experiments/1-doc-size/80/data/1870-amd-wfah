carved for a tombstone. It may be a long way from that 
to art " 

"You are bridging it over fiercely, Hurst J This is Sylvia 
Redmond, only you have fashioned the child's face too high 
and fine for the wife of Eustace Gilliat. In ten years she will 
lower to his level, become a weak, fashionable, fine woman. 
Another poor moth caught." 

"It might have been different, I think," averting his face, 
and chipping at the bit of gray rock under his hand. 

" Might have beens are the wrecks of the world. You find 
them stranded on all the shores along life," and Trewartha 
gave a keen, satirical smile. " Is it a kind of regretful excuse 
appealing to our self-love? So few of us would be willing to 
admit that we had been weighed in the balance and found 
wanting. And surely Sylvia would have to go farther back than 
her parents to find much stamina." 

" So you saddle the children with their father's sins !" Victor 
exclaimed, as if in a mood of unreasonable anger. 

"Hasn't Holy Writ declared it? Yet men and women go 
on perpetuating themselves, their follies, weaknesses, crimes, 
and wonder that the world is full of sin. Faugh ! But that's 
theology or ethics rather than art. So you have taken this up 
for the first time this summer ?" 

Victor felt curt and ungracious. He was sore at heart, his 
natural disposition, circumstances, and the tenor of his whole 
life disposed him to reticence. And then the keen, mortifying 
thought of failure stung him to the quick. So he studied Tre- 
wartha's face furtively. 



 

A face cultured to something larger than mere worldly uses ; 
an outgrowth of health, satisfaction, experience, and rare intel 
ligence. If he could have such a friend.

"It dates farther back than that," he said, with a rapid, forced 
frankness, as if in the next moment's mood he might repent 
and withdraw the confidence. "The only business fancy of 
my boyhood was engraving ; but a man who would have taken 
me, was a person of very loose, irregular habits, and I must 
have gone to New York alone. A higher authority than mine 
overruled it. Then as I neared manhood I took to rude 
sketching like this." 

From a time-worn portfolio, he produced several of the old 
sketches. Trewartha seated himself on the rock, and began to 
examine them. 

' ' You had models ?" 

" I used to study the men in the shop, with their brawny 
arms, and chests, and resolute faces. Is it true that rough 
physical vigor and work drains the brain, starves it ? This 
man was a drunkard Connor. Was it the evil in him, or 
circumstances?" 

" A little of both ;" dryly. " You had a teacher?" 

"Not for those." 

" Ah, here is the Tantalus !" Trewartha raised his eyes and 
studied Victor's face critically. " I think I understand ;" 
slowly, and with an air of penetration accenting the brow and 
eyes. "It was not mere physical thirst. It is a type of some 
thing finer, farther off; the desire for some end not distinctly 
in view, but felt, nevertheless ; a soul process crying out through 
the blank, dark night ; a passion that cou\$ not be put in 
words. Yes, I understand it ;" half absently, as if he were 
talking to himself. 

"When I came to have money of my own ;" and Victor 
tried to steady his voice, that would be tremulous with all the
