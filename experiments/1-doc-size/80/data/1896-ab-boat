of such stature that his tibia reached 
to the middle of a tall man's thigh. In 
the lower partition lay a female figure, 
adorned still by one tress of golden hair. 
At this, however, a monk snatched too 
eagerly, and it fell into dust. At the 
same time and place they came upon a 
leaden cross, bearing the inscription in 
Latin, "Here lies buried in the Island 
Avallonia the renowned King Arthur." 
The bones were afterward removed to 
the great church, and placed before the 
high altar, where now the soil into 
which they have been transmuted nour- 
ishes the daisy-starred grass, which is 
the carpet of ruins. But if the king 
died not, and was but carried to Avalon 
for the healing of his wounds, when 
 

shall he return ? The story " sometimes 
represents Arthur and his men dozing 
away, surrounded by their treasures, in 
a cave in Snowdon, till the bell of des- 
tiny rings the hour for their sallying 
forth to victory over the Saxon foe ; 
sometimes they allow themselves to be 
seen of a simple shepherd, whiling away 
their time at chess in the cavities of 
Cadbury; and sometimes they are de- 
scribed lying beneath the Eildon Hills, 
buried in an enchanted sleep, to be 
broken at length by one 

" 'That bids the charmed sleep of ages fly. 
Rolls the long sound through Eildon's caverns vast, 
While each dark warrior rouses at the blast, 
His horn, his falchion, grasps with mighty hand, 
And peals proud Arthur's march from Fairyland.' " 

In a field adjoining the abbey grounds, 
stands the Abbot's Kitchen, an excellent 
example of early domestic architecture. 
It is a building square without, octago- 
nal within, furnished with huge fire- 
places at the comers (wherein one can 
stand and look up to the sky), and a 
central louvre for light and ventilation. 
A cruciform tithe -bam, ancient inns, 
and two historic churches also invite 
the antiquarian eye. The traveler who 
 

climbs the stony street, lined with 
squalid dwellings, to Wearyall Hill will 
only be rewarded by a small tablet set 
in the ground where stood Joseph's 
miraculous thorn ; but all over the town 
he will be offered slips from that mar- 
velous tree, which must have been as 
wide - spreading as a banyan, to have 
been so cut and distributed. However 
it came, there is no doubt that Glaston- 
bury possesses a species of thorn — 
probably brought from the East — which 
blooms twice a year, once at the usual 
time and again in the winter, though it 
is only by a poetic license which none 
but the hypercritical will dispute, that it 
is said to open exactly on Christmas 
Day. 

The ascent of Glastonbury Tor, by an 
encircling path, is difficult indeed. On 
approaching the breezy summit, one feels 
obliged to sit down for frequent inter- 
vals of rest, clutching the long grass as 
a safeguard against rolling down again. 
But once under the shadow of Saint 
Michael's Tower, — doubtless a pilgrim
