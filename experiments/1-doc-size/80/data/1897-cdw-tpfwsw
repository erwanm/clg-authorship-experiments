it was considered ill -manners for the 
gentleman not to kiss his partner. In- 
deed, in all households, and in all ranks 
of society the guest was expected to 
salute thus all the ladies — a custom

which the grave Erasmus, who was in 
England in the reign of Henry VIII., 
found not disagreeable. 

Magnificence of display went hand in 
hand with a taste for cruel and barbarous 
amusements. At this same dinner to 
the Constable of Castile, the two buffets 
of the king and queen in the audience- 
chamber, where the banquet was held, 
were loaded with plate of exquisite work- 
manship, rich vessels of gold, agate, and 
other precious stones. The constable 
drank to the king the health of the 
queen from the lid of a cup of agate of 
extraordinary beauty and richness, set 
with diamonds and rubies, praying his 
majesty would condescend to drink the 
toast from the cup, which he did ac- 
cordingly, and then the constable di- 
rected that the cup should remain in 
his majesty's buffet. The constable 
also drank to the queen the health of 
the king from a very beautiful dragon- 
shaped cup of crystal garnished with 
gold, drinking from the cover, and the 
queen, standing up, gave the pledge 
from the cup itself, and then the consta- 
ble ordered that the cup should remain 
in the queen's buffet. The banquet 
lasted three hours, when the cloth was 
removed, the table was placed upon the 
ground — that is, removed from the dais 
— and their majesties, standing upon it, 
washed their hands in basins, as did the 
others. After the dinner was the ball, 
and that ended, they took their places 
at the windows of a room that looked 
out upon a square, where a platform 
was raised and a vast crowd was assem- 
bled to see the king's bears fight with 
greyhounds. This afforded great amuse- 
ment. Presently a bull, tied to the end 
of a rope, was fiercely baited by dogs. 
After this tumblers danced upon a rope 




 

and performed feats of agility on horse- 
back. The constable and his attendants 
were lighted home by half an hundred 
halberdiers with torches, and, after the 
fatigues of the day, supped in private. 
We are not surprised to read that 
on Monday, the 30th, the constable 
awoke with a slight attack of lum- 
bago. 

Like Elizabeth, all her subjects were 
fond of the savage pastime of bear and 
bull baiting. It cannot be denied that 
this people had a taste for blood, took 
delight in brutal encounters, and drew 
the sword and swung the cudgel with 
great promptitude ; nor were they fas-
