rigid as he will under Puritanism. He 
is not uncrowned as in the Restoration." 
He has entered like a young man into 
all the lusty experiences of life, every 
allurement is known, the sweetness and 
novelty of things are strong with him. 
He plunges into all sensations. " Such 
were the men of this time, Raleigh, 
Essex, Elizabeth, Henry VIII. himself, 
excessive and inconstant, ready for de- 
votion and for crime, violent in good 
and evil, heroic with strange weak- 
nesses, humble with sudden changes of 
mood, never vile with premeditation like 
the roisterers of the Restoration, never 
rigid on principle like the Puritans of 
the Revolution, capable of weeping like 
children, and of dying like men-, often 
i 
 
base courtiers, more than once true 
knights, displaying constantly, amidst 
all these contradictions of bearing, only 
the overflowing of nature. Thus pre- 
pared, they could take in everything, 
sanguinary ferocity and refined gener- 
osity, the brutality of shameless de- 
bauchery, and the most divine inno- 
cence of love, accept all the characters, 
wantons and virgins, princes and moun- 
tebanks, pass quickly from trivial buf- 
foonery to lyrical sublimities, listen al- 
ternately to the quibbles of clowns and 
the songs of lovers. The drama even, 
in order to satisfy the prolixity of their 
nature, must take all tongues, pompous, 
inflated verse, loaded with imagery, and 
side by side with this vulgar prose ; 
more than this, it must distort its natu- 
ral style and limits, put songs, poetical 
devices in the discourse of courtiers and 
the speeches of statesmen ; bring on the 
 
stage the fairy world of opera, as Mid- 
dleton says, gnomes, nymphs of the 
land and sea, with their groves and 
meadows; compel the gods to descend 
upon the stage, and hell itself to furnish 
its world of marvels. No other theatre 
is so complicated, for nowhere else do 
we find men so complete." 
M. Taine heightens this picture in 
generalizations splashed with innumera- 
ble blood-red details of English life and 
character. The English is the most 
warlike race in Europe, most redoubt- 
able in battle, most impatient of slavery. 
" English savages " is what Cellini calls 
them ; and the great shins of beef with 
which they fill themselves nourish the 
force and ferocity of their instincts. To 
harden them thoroughly, institutions 
work in the same groove as nature. 
The nation is armed. Every man is a 
soldier, bound to have arms according to 
 
his condition, to exercise himself on 
Sundays and holidays. The State re- 
sembles an army ; punishments must 
inspire terror ; the idea of war is ever 
present. Such instincts, such a history, 
raises before them with tragic severi- 
ty the idea of life ; death is at hand, 
wounds, blood, tortures. The fine pur- 
ple cloaks, the holiday garments, else- 
where signs of gayety of mind, are stain- 
ed with blood and bordered with black. 
Throughout a stern discipline, the axe 
ready for every suspicion of treason ;
