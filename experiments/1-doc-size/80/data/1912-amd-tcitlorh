Oh, Tip ! ” Mr. Mann caught him in his arms. 

I’ve heard of people being all heart. See here, 
Dan shall take you over, and you may kindle up 
a fire and comfort the old house for the loss of 
all that were so dear.” 

Prim caught the little leg and the hand that 
held it. 

No one shall scold you when you cry. Tip, 
for if it hadn’t been for you nothing would have 
happened to us. Don’t you remember the after- 
noon we’d been playing in the dirt and were tired, 
and we sat down on the stoop and you said, ' Let’s 
cry ’cause mother’s gone away,’ and we cried and 
cried, and Mr. Mann came along ” 


Mr. Mann held up his hand and gave an omi- 
nous shake of the head. 

Well, you weren’t our father then, you were 
Mr. Mann,” continued Prim in no wise abashed. 

And you stopped and asked us what we were 
crying about. And if it hadn’t been for Tip we 
wouldn’t have cried, and you wouldn’t have found 
us, and we’d never had this supersplendatious 
Christmas nor any new father. And how we 
looked! Goldie hustled us into the house to get 
washed ” 

Yes, I was so ashamed of them,” declared 
Marigold, turning red at the remembrance. 

Mr. Mann laughed and laughed. Like a picture 
it came back to him, the incident that had changed 
so much of his life, given him work and duty and 
a love he had never known before. He kissed 
little Tip with great gladness. 

“If you folks don’t come to breakfast it’ll all 
be spiled ! ” announced big Lide.

There was not much Christmas keeping at 
Denby except in the way of big family dinners, 
and that interfered with a morning service. But 
in the afternoon there was a small attempt, 
prayers and some Christmas hymns and distribu- 
tion of books. On this afternoon there was quite 


 

a concourse. And after the benediction everybody 
crowded up around the minister. 

Wasn’t it the most astonishing thing ! ” began 
Mrs. Deacon Silsby. ‘‘ I declare you could have 
knocked me down with a feather. What was it 
like ? And they say the man’s rich ! He oughter 
be to take them eight children just as they’re get- 
ting to be the biggest expense. Do tell us all 
about it ! ” 

It was a very pretty wedding,” said Mrs. 
Burnham. Mr. Mann came over on Tuesday 
and engaged husband. We were dreadfully sur- 
prised and could hardly believe it, but he said they 
had only been engaged three weeks, though he had 
known them since last summer. He sent Chan 
to the hospital, you know. The house is large and 
well furnished, right on the most stylish avenue. 
There was only his business partner and wife, but 
some one had attended to the dressing, and the 
children were a pretty sight. I never saw Bessy
