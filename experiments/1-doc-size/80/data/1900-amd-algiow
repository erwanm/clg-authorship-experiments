porch, and some young neighbors were added; and as no night was ever
too warm to dance, they had a merry time.

There was another long day of enjoyment to Marian Floyd. They went down
to the bank of the Potomac on a picnic, with loads of provisions. They
rambled about; they had a lazy, drifting sail adown the shadiest bank;
they sang and jested, and went home gay, tired, happy, full of the
gladness of youth.

Marian was sharing Jaqueline's room from choice. The latter had grown
into young-ladyhood so rapidly that it hardly seemed as if there was
much difference in their ages, even though Marian was so much more
sedate, and latterly had become rather timid.

"I have had such a good time!" she said with a sigh. "I don't know when
I have enjoyed anything so much. There are so few young people around
the Pineries. Mother will be just delighted with that pudding, but she
will think I ought to have done more lacework. I wonder if I will have
time to finish that flower in the morning?"

"You can get up early," suggested Jaqueline. "Very early--for we are
going for a canter before breakfast."

"Well--Cato can't get here before ten, I think. That will be after
breakfast."

"Then you can come to bed with a clear conscience. I think I am asleep
everywhere but the tip of my tongue and a little spot in my brain."

"And--I wanted to talk to you."

Jaqueline tumbled into bed and squeezed up her pillow.

"Talk fast," she said good-humoredly.

Marian sat down on the side of the bed, combing her hair and twisting
it up in two soft coils. Then she put on her nightcap, a dainty bit of
lawn and ruffling, and looked pretty enough to charm anyone.

"I don't know what to do! Oh, Jacky, I am the happiest girl and the
most miserable girl alive!"

Jaqueline raised on her elbow, quite wide awake at the admission.

"Did you guess that Lieutenant Ralston cared? It is so--so wonderful to
have a real lover, who can put his meaning in his eyes and in the clasp
of his hand, and make you feel it all about you, just that way your
father loves your mother. All day to-day I have been in that curious
tremble; I wanted to look and I did not dare, and then I looked in
spite of myself. And this evening----"

"Yes--I managed that you should go off by yourselves. And now, Polly,
you won't marry that Mr. Greaves?"

"Oh, what can I do? You see, father is set upon it. And Mr. Ralston
wants to come up and ask father, and I didn't dare tell him about it,
and don't know what to do."

"Why, let him come up. And if grandpapa won't give in, I'd run away,
that's all. Oh, Polly, I am so glad! It must be just lovely! Though I
do not want to be engaged just yet. I like fun. And there are so many
fine gentlemen in Washington who say such pretty complimentary things
and dance so beautifully, and Mrs. Carrington expects me to make her a
long visit next winter. I'd rather have a dozen lovers than just one.
But it is different with you, and you are older; and at home grandmamma
treats you like a little child. Yes, I'd let him come and have it
over."

"But it would be awful. I never could get the courage to tell; and if
father was taken by surprise----"

"Why, I should say that a friend was coming----"

"But he knows that Mr. Ralston paid me a good deal of attention
when I was at Jane's, and that was why he would not let me go to the
inauguration. And if I were to say he had been here two days, and I had
ridden and walked with him, and he had said--he did not ask me to be
engaged of course, until he had seen father."

"And what did you say? You couldn't refuse altogether?"
