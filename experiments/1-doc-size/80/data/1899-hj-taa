him. I wouldn't have come down here if I hadn't." 

" Not for any other reason ?" Mr. Longdon gravely in- 
quired. 

" Not for your being here, do you mean ?" 

He hesitated. "Me and other persons." 




 

She showed somehow that she wouldn't flinch.    You 
weren't asked till after he had made sure I'd come. 
We've become, you and I/' she smiled, '  one of the 
couples who are invited together." 

These were couples, his speculative eye seemed to 
show, he didn't even yet know about, and if he mentally 
took them up a moment it was only, promptly, to drop 
them.  ''I don't think you put it quite strong enough, 
you know." 

" That Mitchy is hard hit ? He puts it so strong him- 
self that it will surely do for both of us. I'm a part of 
what I just spoke of — his indifference and magnificence. 
It's as if he could only afford to do what's not vulgar. 
He might perfectly marry a Duke's daughter, but that 
tuould be vulgar — would be the absolute necessity and 
ideal of nine out of ten of the sons of shoemakers made 
ambitious by riches. Mitchy says 'No ; I take my own 
line ; I go in for a beggar-maid.' And it's only because 
I'm a beggar maid that he wants me." 

 ' But there are plenty of others," Mr. Longdon ob- 
jected. 

'' Oh, I admit I'm the one he least dislikes. But if I 
had any money," Nanda went on,  '' or if I were really 
good-looking — for that to-day, the real thing, will do as 
well as being a Duke's daughter — he wouldn't come near 
me. And I think that ought to settle it. Besides, he 
must marry Aggie. She's a beggar-maid too — as well as 
an angel ; so there's nothing against it." 

Mr. Longdon stared, but even in his surprise seemed to 
take from the swiftness with which she made him move 
over the ground a certain agreeable glow. ''Does 'Ag- 
gie ' like him ?" 

" She likes every one. As I say, she's an angel — but a 
real, real, real one. The kindest man in the world is 
therefore the proper husband for her. If Mitchy wants 
to do something thoroughly nice," she declared with the 





  

same high competence, ''he'll take her out of her situa- 
tion, which is awful." 

Mr. Longdon looked graver. "In what way awful ?" 

" Why, don't you know ?" His eye was now cold enough 
to give her, in her chill, a flurried sense that she might 
displease him least by a graceful lightness. "The Duch- 
ess and Lord Petherton are like you and me." 

" Is it a conundrum ?" He was serious indeed. 

" They're one of the couples who are invited together." 
But his face reflected so little success for her levity that 
it was in another tone she presently added : " Mitchy 
really oughtn't." Her friend, in silence, fixed his eyes 
on the ground ; an attitude in which there was something
