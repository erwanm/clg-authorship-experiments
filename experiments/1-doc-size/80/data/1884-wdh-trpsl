hasn't been arrested yet." 

Lapham waited a while "before he said, " Well, 
now, your mother and I want you should hold up 
on that a while." 

" It isn't for you to say. It 's something I can't 
hold up on." 

" Yes, I guess you can. If I know what 's hap 
pened, then what 's happened is a thing that nobody 
is to blame for. And we want you should make the 
best of it and not the worst. Heigh ? It ain't 
going to help Irene any for you to hurt yourself or 
anybody else ; and I don't want you should take up 
with any such crazy notion. As far as heard from, 
you haven't stolen anything, and whatever you've 
got belongs to you." 

" Has he been speaking to you, father ? " 

"Your mother's been speaking to me." 

" Has he been speaking to you ?"

speak to him again ! " 

" If he was any such fool as to promise that he

don't say you Ve got to have him ; I want you 
should feel perfectly free about that ; but I do say 
you Ve got to give him a reason." 

" Is he coming here ? " 

" I don't know as you 'd call it coming " 

" Yes, you do, father ! " said the girl, in forlorn 
amusement at his shuffling. 

" He 's coming here to see me " 

" When 's he coming ? " 

" I don't know but he's coming to-night." 

" And you want I should see him ? " 

" I don't know but you 'd better." 

" All right. I 'll see him." 

Lapham drew a long deep breath of suspicion in 
spired by this acquiescence. " What you going to 
do ? " he asked presently. 

" I don't know yet," answered the girl sadly. " It 
depends a good deal upon what he does." 

" Well," said Lapham, with the hungriness of un
