" Not alone ? Why, Kathie, " 

" I am going to stay with her " ; and Kathie put her 
head down on Uncle Eobert's breast. 

" Not come home for Christmas ! " echoed Uncle 
Eobert, in surprise. 

" No " ; and then Kathie told him all her story, her 
own half-formed resolves and her conversation with 
Dr. Markham. Yery truthfully and simply too, touch- 
ing upon the disappointment which she still felt with 
all a child's keenness. 

" My dear, noble girl, I have not a word to say. 
Of course Aunt Euth would very willingly spare you, 
and the holidays at home will lose half their enjoy- 
ment. But under the circumstances it is best to stay 
right on, and Aunt Euth needs the comfort. Poor 
child ! it has been harder than any of us imagined in 
the beginning." 

And then the tender lips kissed Kathie many 
times. A brave, unselfish child indeed ! 

" We shall have to keep the Christmas until you 
do come home, even if it is out of date. But I have 
promised the boys a tree and wax lights innumera- 
ble." 

" I wish you would invite some of the children in 



 

to see it. And I 'd like to fly through, the ceiling for 
five minutes and hear all the exclamations. How 
Freddy will enjoy it ! " 

"And Mr. Meredith is coming. He was up on 
Saturday and returned with us." 

" Did he tell you about General Mackenzie ? I 
liked him so much. He made me think of you con- 
tinually, only he is a great deal older. And I wrote 
you that I went to an opera ? " 

"Yes. I am glad that you have had such a 
pleasant time." 

" And I haven't been scarcely a bit homesick. 
Only now and then when I think of you all, and go 
to bed without a host of fond good-nights, it seems 
lonesome. Only if Aunt Euth can live 

" My darling, I hope she will. I pray for it hourly. 
Yet she does not look nearly so well as a fortnight 
ago, though that may be owing to her recent opera- 
tion. We have no one to lose, have we, Kathie ? " 

" Not one." 

He held her tightly to his heart. Of all the duties 
he had taken upon himself since his return, the 
pleasantest was being a father to this fatherless little 
girl. 





"And how does the purse hold out?' : he asked, 

gayly.
