CHAPTER VIII. 

A TROUBLESOME CHARACTER. 

Bijah Mudge stepped painfully over a 
tub of yellow ochre and crossed the print-room 
at the overseer's beck. There had been an 
order of some kind, but he was growing deaf, and 
the heavy engines were on. The overseer repeated it. 

"Sir?" 

" I said your notice, didn't I .'' I say your 
notice, don't I ! You 'll work your notice, you 
will." 

"A-a-ah !" said Bijah, drawing a long breath. 
He stood and knotted his lean fingers together, 
watching the yellow dye drop off. 

" Is there a reason given, sir ." 

" No reason." 

" Folks my age ain't often ordered on notice 
(without reason," said the old man, feebly. 

" Folks your age should be more particular 





how they give satisfaction," said the overseer, 
significantly. 

" I 've known o' cases as where a boss has 
guessed at a reason, on his own hook, you know, 
Jim." 

Irish Jim was in the print-rooms at Hayle and 
Kelso at that time. Some said the new partner 
had a finger in getting him out of the weaving- 
room. It was a sharp fellow, and belonged some- 
where. Here he would be brutal to old men and 
little boys ; but there were no girls in the print- 
room. 

" On his own hook and at a guess," said the 
"boss," "a man might ask who testified to Boston 
on a recent little hour-bill as we know of." 

" I testified," cried the old man, shrilly, " 
before a committee of the Legislature of the State 
of Massachusetts. I 'd do it ag'in, Jim ! In the 
face of my notice, I 'd do it ag'in ! At the risk 
o' the poor-us, I 'd do it ag'in ! I call Hayle and 
Kelso to witness as I 'd do it ag'in ! In the name 
of the State of Massachusetts, I 'd do it ag'in ! " 

''Do it again ! " said Jim, with a brutal oath. 
" Who binders you .' " 
" But there were no reasons J " added the oyer- 





seer, sharply. " You fail to give satisfaction, 
that 's all ; there 's no reasons." 

" I am an old man to be turned out o' work 
sudden, sir." The thin defiance in Bijah's voice
