to ashes; to whom renunciation was the last throw left in the game
of life. He was a young man, ardent, eager, buoyant, confiding in
hope because he had not tested it; believing in happiness because
he had not known it: full of untried, untamed capacity for human
delight, and with the instinct (generations old) of a luxurious
training toward human ease. He had cut the silken cords between
himself and the world of his old habits, ambitions, and friends
with a steady stroke; he had smitten the soft network like a man,
and flung it from him like a spirit; but there were hours when
he felt as if he were bleeding to death, inwardly, from sheer
desolation.

“That call of George Fenton’s upset me last night,” he said aloud,
as he sank down at the base of a big boulder in the warm sand.
He sometimes talked to the sea; nothing else in Windover could
understand him; he was acquiring some of the habits of lonely
people who live apart from their own class. How impossible it would
have been in Cambridge, in Boston, or in Cesarea to be caught
talking aloud! His pale face flushed, and he drew his hat over it,
thanking Heaven that rocks were deaf and the downs were dumb, that
the sun would never tell, and the harbor was too busy to listen.
He had lain there in the sand for some time, as motionless as a
mollusk at low water.

“All a man needs is a little common rest,” he thought. The April
sun seemed to sink into his brain and heart with the healing touch
that nothing human ever gives. He pushed his hat away from his
face, and looked up gratefully, as if he had been caressed.

As he did so, he heard footsteps upon the crisp, red-cupped moss
that surrounded the base of the boulder. He rose instinctively, and
confronted a woman--a lady. She had been walking far and fast, and
had glorious color. The skirt of her purple gown was splashed with
little sticks and burrs and bits of moss; her hands were full of
saxifrage. She was trying in the rising wind to hold a sun-umbrella
over her head, for she wore the street or traveling dress of the
town, and her little bonnet gave her as much protection from the
sun as a purple butterfly whose wings were dashed with gold.

Oddly enough, he recognized the costume before he did the wearer;
so incredible did he find it that she should stand there living,
glowing, laughing,--a sumptuous beauty, stamped against the
ascetic sky of Windover.

“You!” he cried.

“Oh, I did not expect--I did not think”--she stammered. He had
never seen Helen Carruth disconcerted. But she blushed like a
schoolgirl when she gave him, saxifrage and all, her ungloved hand.

“Mother sent me!--I came down for her and father!” began Helen
Carruth abruptly. Then she thought how that sounded--as if she need
be supposed to apologize for or explain the circumstance that she
happened to find one of her father’s old students sunning himself
upon a given portion of the New England coast; and she blushed
again. When she saw the sudden, upward motion of Bayard’s heavy
eyelids, she could have set her pretty teeth through her tongue,
for vexation at her little faux pas. From sheer embarrassment,
she laughed it off.

“I haven’t heard anybody laugh like that since I came to Windover,”
said Bayard, drawing a long breath. “Do give me an encore!”

“Now, then, you are laughing at me!”

“Upon the word of a poor heretic parson--no. You can’t think how it
sounds. It sinks in--like the sun.”

“But I don’t feel like laughing any more. I’ve got all over it. I’m
afraid I can’t oblige you.”

“Why not? You used to be good-natured, I thought--in Cesarea, ages
ago.”
