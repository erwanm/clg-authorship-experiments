to breathe, in the intensity of his excitement. 

He had hardly uttered the words before he heard 
the crash which announced the doom of the Wood- 


ville. Her sharp bow slid up on the ledge, and 
she suddenly stopped in her mad flight. 

Lawry bent on his oars again, hon-ified by the 
accident. He pulled as he had never pulled before. 
A moment or two after the steamer struck, he was 
startled by a succession of shrill shrieks from the 
ladies, and he turned to see what had happened. 
The Woodville had filled, rolled oiF the rock, 
and sunk in deep water, leaving her passengers 
floating helplessly on the lake. The upper half 
of her smoke-stack was all that remained in sight 
of the beautiful craft which three minutes before 
had been a thing of beauty on the waves. 

The young pilot did not pause an instant to con- 
template the scene of destruction. He saw only the 
helpless persons struggling for life in the water, and 
he renewed his labors with a vigor and skill which 
soon brought him to the suff'erers. Mr. Sherwood 
was supporting his wife ; but both of them were 
nearly exhausted. Lawry helped Bertha into the 
boat, and told her husband to hold on at the rail. 

Ethan French, with his arm around the waist of 
Fanny Jane, was holding on at the smoke-stack. 



 

where also the fireman of the boat was supporting 
himself. 

"Where is Fanny?" gasped Mrs. Sherwood, as 
soon as she had been assisted into the boat. 

" Tm afraid she has gone down," replied Ethan 
French. " I saw her just there a moment since." 

" I see her ! " said Lawry, as he dived into the 
lake. 

Fanny, exhausted by her struggles, had sunk, and 
Lawry, with a strong arm, bore her to the surface 
again ; but she was too large and heavy for him, 
and he could not support her. 

Before the arrival of the boat, Ethan was in the 
act of transferring his helpless burden to the arms 
of the fireman, that he might go to the assistance of 
Miss Fanny ; and, as soon as Lawry appeared, he 
swam out to help him. With the aid of the young 
engineer, the exhausted lady was lifted into the boat. 
Fanny Jane was next taken in, but there was no 
room for any more. 

Though Miss Fanny was in a worse condition 
than the other ladies, she still had her senses ; and 
none of the party were in danger. Mr. Sherwood, 



 



Ethan, and the fireman were still in the water, hold- 
ing on at the rail of the boat. Lawry took the 
oars and pulled towards the ferry-landing. 

" Thank God, we are all safe ! " said Mr. Sher- 
wood, when he had recovered breath enough to 
speak.
