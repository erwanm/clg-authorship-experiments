dreary. Mr. Wentworth and his daughters put on 
overshoes and went to church, and Felix Young, 
without overshoes, went also, holding an umbrella 
over Gertrude. It is to be feared that, in the 
whole observance, this was the privilege he most 
highly valued. The Baroness remained at home ; 
she was in neither a cheerful nor a devotional 
mood. She had, however, never been, during her 
residence in the United States, what is called a" 
regular attendant at divine service ; and on this 
particular Sunday morning of which I began with 
speaking she stood at the window of her little 
drawing-room, watching the long arm of a rose- 
tree that was attached to her piazza, but a portion 
of which had disengaged itself, sway to and fro, 
shake and gesticulate, against the dusky drizzle of 
the sky. Every now and then, in a gust of wind, 
the rose-tree scattered a shower of water-drops 



   

against the window-pane; it appeared to have a 
kind of human movement a menacing, warn- 
ing intention. The room was very cold ; Mad- 
ame Miinster put on a shawl and walked about. 
Then she determined to have some fire ; and sum- 
moning her ancient negress, the contrast of whose 
polished ebony and whose crimson turban had 
been at first a source of satisfaction to her, she 
made arrangements for the production of a crack- 
ling flame. This old woman's name was Azarina. 
The Baroness had begun by thinking that there 
would be a savory wildness in her talk, and, for 
amusement, she had encouraged her to chatter. 
But Azarina was dry and prim ; her conversation 
was anything but African ; she reminded Eugenia 
of the tiresome old ladies she met in society. She 
knew, however, how to make a fire ; so that after 
she had laid the logs, Eugenia, who was terribly 
bored, found a quarter of an hour's entertainment 
in sitting and watching them blaze and sputter. 
She had thought it very likely Robert Acton would 
come and see her ; she had not met him since 
that infelicitous evening. But the morning waned 
without his coming ; several times she thought she 
heard his step on the piazza ; but it was only a 
window-shutter shaking in a rain -gust. The Bar- 
oness, since the beginning of that episode in her 
career of which a slight sketch has been attempted 



 

in these pages, had had many moments of irrita- 
tion. But to-day her irritation had a peculiar 
keenness ; it appeared to feed upon itself. It 
urged her to do something ; but it suggested no 
particularly profitable line of action. If she could 
have done something at the moment, on the spot, 
she would have stepped upon a European steamer 
and turned her back, with a kind of rapture, upon 
that profoundly mortifying failure, her visit to her 
American relations. It is not exactly apparent 
why she should have termed this enterprise a fail- 
ure, inasmuch as she had been treated with the 
highest distinction for which allowance had been 
made in American institutions. Her irritation 
came, at bottom, from the sense, which, always 
present, had suddenly grown acute, that the social 
soil on this big, vague continent was somehow not 
adapted for growing those plants whose fragrance 
she especially inclined to inhale and by which she 
liked to see herself surrounded a species of vege- 
tation for which she carried a collection of seed- 
lings, as we may say, in her pocket. She found 
her chief happiness in the sense of exerting a cei 
tain power and making a certain impression ; and
