wondering look on the face of the myth- 
ignoring inhabitants. But, we might 
have asked, to what end should Devon 
kitchens exist, save for the perpetuating 
of sacred lore and setting before the 
reverent palate hot coUops of venison, such 
as were approved by its tutelary giant, 
and all else that went to the nourishing 
of his mightiness } Shame on him who 
would remove one guidepost of the culinary 
past, one viand embalmed in story ! 
Let his name be anathema, though he 
invent a thousand modem trifles, or a 
sauce to outrival Worcestershire. For 
no tickling of the palate under new com- 
binations can compensate for the starving 
of the soul. 

You who have trodden English by- 
paths and fallen in with ancient ways, 
did you ever eat English buns without 
a jingling mental accompaniment to the 
tune of the old nursery rhyme.? And 
though you consumed them luxuriously 
in the London ABC shops, or made 
your touring staff that other variety to 
 

be found, yellow with saffron, beside the 
Cornish sea, were they not soul-satisfy- 
ing and plummy ? I charge you, O seek- 
ers of inward joy, by all the past eating 
you have ever done, to your own enlarge- 
ment of vision, that, when you come 
upon a classic dish, you pass it not by. 
And north and south the traditionary 
riches of the kitchen shall be yours. For 
in Derbyshire, you shall eat Bakewell 
pudding, of the genus tart, having, as 
one greater than the world of realists 
hath said, "a sort of mixed flavor of 
cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast tur- 
key, toffy, and hot buttered toast." At 
Banbury, or possibly farther afield among 
the Shakespeare haunts, you may pur- 
chase the unholy Banbury cake, which is 
no less than a superlatively rich mince 
turnover, evidently without the meat, 
but compensating for all conventional 
lack by fruits and spices. Without 
doubt it will trouble your dreams, for 
no Banbury cake ever did its spiriting 
gently; but in the end, when absence 
shall have softened every harsh detail 
of that English journey, it will linger, a 
spicy savor, in your happy memory. You 
shall eat haggis and scones in Scotland, 


roast goose and apple-sauce wherever 
you can get them, star-gazing pie in 
Cornwall (filled with pilchards, their in- 
nocent heads protruding above the crust), 
and go, like all your generation and the 
fathers of the English-speaking race, to 
Richmond, to dine at the Star and Garter, 
upon whitebait and Richmond maids-of- 
honor. You shall eat chad from Lake 
Windermere, in memory of the Roman 
legions who carried that royal family 
thither; and everywhere shall you bow 
down before old England's roast beef, 
though she import it from Australia or 
America, and so hold historic lien upon 
it by courtesy only. Her chops, of a 
thickness and succulence unknown in 
the golden West, shall tell their own 
story of growth in fields fat with yellow 
mustard blooms, where the innocent 
sheep hourly nibble and munch, uncon-
