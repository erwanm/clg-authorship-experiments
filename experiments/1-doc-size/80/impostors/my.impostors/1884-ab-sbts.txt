real talent. He's erratic enough." 

' But private lessons ! Don't they cost ever so 
much ? " 

' Now, my child," said Oswald, " you are never to 
hint that you don't want to spend money. Don't let 
me feel there's a bit of vulgar pride in your heart." 

Elizabeth put her cheek softly down on the hand 
that rested on his chair and then looked up at him, 
with happy tears filling her eyes. ' You are so good 
to me," she cried. ' So generously good to help 
Philip, too ! Don't you suppose I am grateful to you 
every day, when I see him so happy ? ' : 

'Foolish child," said Oswald, caressing her head 
with his other palm. He could not have endured 
much literal, outspoken gratitude, but a subtle trace of 
incense in the air was sweet savor to his nostrils. That 
the fragrance should rise suddenly, when the fire 
blazed higher on the altar, was exactly as he would 
have had it. 'You forget, I never asked you for grati- 
tude. I want the sweet look in your eyes and the 
blush that hasn't done rising yet, when I come near 
you. Why, it's coming now ! Elizabeth, you're not 
quite used to your lover yet ! ' 

He held up her face with one finger under her chin, 
and dropped his own laughing one to a level with it. 
Elizabeth was fast gaining a charming coquetry, which 
the simplest woman is easily taught. Since Oswald 
had told her the corners of her mouth held tiny 
dimples, and laughingly laid kisses there, bidding the 
dimples keep them till he came to take them away, she 
could not be unconscious that the lips quivered with 





remembrance, when he looked at them again. If he 
laughed at her blushes, how could she help their rising 
when there was no excuse for it ? Oswald knew the 
alphabet of love, and read and discoursed fluently 
in its language. Elizabeth answered, in such eloquence 
of word and thought as astonished herself. " The 
dull, quiet girl of Stratford must be dead," she told 
herself in exultation, seeing her own face glad and 
awakened, as only a delight in life can make one. No 
inward peace, no philosophy of contentment ever 
approaches it. 

So it was arranged that Felix should give Philip les- 
sons, coming for them twice a week. It was of more 
value to the boy than any One estimated, then. 

Felix's strong, calm nature balanced Philip's impet- 
uosity and reduced some of his flights of fancy to 
reasonable proportions, often stopping ambitious 
fabrics in the building. 

' Well, write me some verses," he said, one day, 
when Philip had been most extravagant in worship of 
the people who had seen themselves in print. " Take 
this fragment from Horace. I'll help you translate it, 
if you have any trouble, and then you may put it into 
English verse." 

Philip trembled with delight and a sense of respons- 
ibility. It was a crisis for him ; he had a wholesome 
respect for his master's opinion, and this seemed a test 
which might establish his claim as something beyond 
the ordinary. He was busy half an hour and then 
came to Felix, holding out the paper. Felix carefully 
read it aloud. 

' Very good for a translation, very good indeed !
