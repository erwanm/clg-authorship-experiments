the mail, I should say. Why, Mrs. Potter, Craig 
went to Grand Man an, with an artist, for sketching. It 
will be a great benefit to him ; think of the scenery 
and climate and queer people ! ' 

Felix could scarcely repress an inclination to call 
her attention to his stroke of policy. A man who 
seldom works with a purpose to deceive is likely to do 
it by the wholesale, and frankly admire himself after the 
effort. 

" Do tell ! ' said Mrs. Potter, in benign apprecia- 



 

tion. ' Do they have all that up there ? I should 
think board must be high." 

Felix rose, feeling that any further enlargement on 
the subject might induce his hostess to tell the next 
comer that Mr. Craig had gone to hunt hippogriffs or 
convert anacondas. After that, he was careful to al- 
lude frequently and familiarly to Oswald, for the bene- 
fit of Stratford ears. This was somewhat to Elizabeth's 
wonder, but she understood it, finally. Susan Fitts 
came in, ostensibly to call, but it was fair to suppose 
she had an errand. All the family knew her well 
enough to be sure of that ; nobody resented the fact 
as belligerently as did Grandmother. 

You goin' back this fall, 'Lizabeth'? '" with a suav- 
ity, the effect of which was quite counteracted by her 
small, watchful eyes. 

' Oh yes, indeed, some time in the fall." 

' I thought maybe you wa'n't, from somethin' that 
was said to me." Silence followed. Elizabeth looked 
up, politely attentive, and, with no idea that there was 
reason for her being uncomfortable, waited for some 
one to start up the conversation. She never could 
think of topics both agreeable and correct for discus- 
sion with Miss Fitts. Most subjects were unsafe, un- 
less one wanted to hear scandal. But Susan went on 
unaided. " Somebody says to me this mornin', ' I guess 
'Lizabeth didn't like Boston as well as she expected 
to.' Then, indeed, poor Elizabeth scented the battle. 
Grandmother headed the charge to the rescue. 

' Susan Fitts, didn't I tell you once that them that 
would fetch a bone would carry one ? Now, here's 
one for you to carry. You can tell any body that's 



 

anxious to know any thing about Elizabeth's husband, 
to come to me. I'll settle 'em ! ' 

" Lor', Mis' Nye, how quick you be ' ' said the at- 
tacking force, in a conciliatory manner signifying 
truce, though her eyes flashed a little and a flush rose 
to her cheek-bones. " I didn't mean a thing out o' the 
way." 

" No," said Grandmother. " I believe that. Gossip 
has come to be your meat and drink You don't know 
when you do it any more than Job Haddon knows 
when he's drunk ! ' 

" If you come to twittin' honest women of bein' 
drunk, Mis' Nye, it's time somebody told you what's 
bein' said about your own. They do say 'Lizabeth's 
had to leave her husband. I don't know any thing about 
it, on'y that's what I'm told." Having fired her broad- 
side, and being conveniently near the door, she swept 
out before there was a chance of reply.
