night, as I did some three hours after leaving La 
Rochelle; for what Poitiers has of best, as they would 
say at Poitiers, is the appearance she presents to the 
arriving stranger who puts his head out of the window 
of the train. I gazed into the gloom from such an 
aperture before we got into the station, for I re 
membered the impression received on another occa 
sion; but I saw nothing save the universal night, 
spotted here and there with an ugly railway lamp. 
It was only as I departed, the following day, that I 
assured myself that Poitiers still makes something of 
the figure she ought on the summit of her consider 
able hill. I have a kindness for any little group of 
towers, any cluster of roofs and chimneys, that lift 
themselves from an eminence over which a long road 
ascends in zigzags; such a picture creates for the mo 
ment a presumption that you are in Italy, and even 
leads you to believe that if you mount the winding 
road you will come to an old town-wall, an expanse 
of creviced brownness, and pass under a gateway sur 
mounted by the arms of a mediaeval despot. Why 
I should find it a pleasure, in France, to imagine my 
self in Italy, is more than I can say; the illusion has 
never lasted long enough to be analyzed. From the 
bottom of its perch Poitiers looks large and high; 
and indeed, the evening I reached it, the interminable 


climb of the omnibus of the hotel I had selected, 
which I found at the station, gave me the measure of 
its commanding position. This hotel, "magnifique 
construction ornee de statues," as the Guide-Joanne, 
usually so reticent, takes the trouble to announce, has 
an omnibus, and, I suppose, has statues, though I 
didn 't perceive them; but it has very little else save 
immemorial accumulations of dirt. It is magnificent, 
if you will, but it is not even relatively proper; and 
a dirty inn has always seemed to me the dirtiest of 
human things, it has so many opportunities to betray 
itself. 

Poitiers covers a large space, and is as crooked 
and straggling as you please; but these advantages are 
not accompanied with any very salient features or any 
great wealth of architecture. Although there are few 
picturesque houses, however, there are two or three 
curious old churches. Notre Dame la Grande, in the 
market-place, a small romanesque structure of the 
twelfth century, has a most interesting and venerable 
exterior. Composed, like all the churches of Poitiers, 
of a light brown stone with a yellowish tinge, it is 
covered with primitive but ingenious sculptures, and is 
really an impressive monument. Within, it has lately 
been daubed over with the most hideous decorative 
painting that was ever inflicted upon passive pillars 
and indifferent vaults. This battered yet coherent 
little edifice has the touching look that resides in 
everything supremely old: it has arrived at the age at 
which such things cease to feel the years; the waves 



of time have worn its edges to a kind of patient dul- 
ness; there is something mild and smooth, like the 
stillness, the deafness, of an octogenarian, even in its 
rudeness of ornament, and it has become insensible 
to differences of a century or two. The cathedral 
interested me much less than Our Lady the Great, 
and I have not the spirit to go into statistics about it. 
It is not statistical to say that the cathedral stands 
half-way down the hill of Poitiers, in a quiet and 
grass-grown place, with an approach of crooked lanes 
and blank garden-walls, and that its most striking 
dimension is the width of its fagade. This width is 
extraordinary, but it fails, somehow, to give nobleness 
to the edifice, which looks within (Murray makes the 
remark) like a large public hall. There are a nave 
and two aisles, the latter about as high as the nave; 
and there are some very fearful modern pictures, 
which you may see much better than you usually see
