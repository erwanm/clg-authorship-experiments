Miss Hamilton was more sprightly, and 
brought to the fore an inspiriting air of pa- 
triotism. She, too, had her tale of hard-won 
victories to recount, of what the party had 
saved the country from, of its glowing aims 
for the future, and she moved her audience to 
applause. 

Then followed schemes of taxation, one 
flatly contradicting the other, and both mak- 



ing points and dropping into fallacies. Plans 
of other nations in raising revenue were ex- 
ploited, and the discussion closed amid great 
applause. 

kk But I do not think you were as convinc- 
ing as you might have been, Gertie. I wanted 
Miss Ferris routed altogether.” 

“ The truth lies between two extremes,” 
she returned, sententiously. “ I’m saving up 
some of my ammunition to the last. Oh, you’ll 
be amazed at Miss Corsen’s protective tariff 
arguments! She goes way back to the times 
of Greece and quotes Aristophanes, who sati- 
rizes the Achanians, who, because they burned 
charcoal, were not ready to have free trade 
forced upon them by war. It’s simply im- 
mense. And old Carthage was strong for 
protection.” 

“ Well, but oughtn’t countries, like individ- 
uals, to improve? Don’t we know more than 
those old Carthaginians ? I always feel mad 
at them because they treated Hannibal so at 
the last.” 

“ But our difference is between M. and N. 
Which will make the better President? 


 


“ The man with the better party back of 
him. After all, Congress is the great thing.” 

“ The Democratic party upheld slavery, any- 
how. I can say it outside,” and the speaker's 
cheeks turned very red. “ I wouldn’t be 
a — ” 

“ Hush! You know we were to taboo per- 
sonalities, and slavery, and the Civil War. It 
is just the politics of to-day.” 

“ But I want the whole truth told. I 
thought of some telling points Miss Hamilton 
might have made. Men don’t scruple to say 
things, and see what scathing articles are in 
the newspapers.” 

“ We are going to put politics on a new 
basis, a cleaner, more generous foundation. It 
is to be principles, not men.” 

“ Not a man ! ” cried some one in a whim- 
sical tone. “ The women are to get the fat 
offices.” 

“ They won’t know how to fill them. They 
can’t rise to heights of political consideration.” 

“ Why, they are doing it out in the new 
States, and no great cataclysm has occurred.”
