" Yes," returned the old man ; "and before the 
leaves are on the ground we shall more 'n have got 
our first letter from her. I declare for 't," he 
added, after a tremulous pause, " I was goin' to say 
how Lyddy would enjoy readin' it to us ! I don't 
seem to get it rightly into my head that she 's goin' 
away." 

" It ain't as if Lyddy was leavin' any life behind 
her that 's over and above pleasant," resumed the 
woman. " She 's a good girl, and I never want to 
see a more uncomplainin' ; but I know it 's duller 



 

and duller here all the while for her, with us two 
old folks, and no young company ; and I 'd know as 
it 's been any better the two winters she 's taught 
in the Mill Village. That 's what reconciles me, 
on Lyddy's account, as much as anything. I ain't 
one to set much store on worldly ambition, and I 
never was ; and I 'd know as I care for Lyddy's ad- 
vancement, as you may call it. I believe that as 
far forth as true happiness goes she 'd be as well off 
here as there. But I don't say but what she would 
be more satisfied in the end, and as long as you 
can't have happiness, in this world, I say you'd 
better have satisfaction. Is that Josiah Whitman's 
hearse goin' past ? " she asked, rising from her 
chair, and craning forward to bring her eyes on 
a level with the window, while she suspended the 
agitation of the palm-leaf fan which, she had not 
ceased to ply during her talk ; she remained a mo- 
ment with the quiescent fan pressed against her 
bosom, and then she stepped out of the door, and 
down the walk to the gate. " Josiah ! " she called, 
while the old man looked and listened at the win- 
dow. " Who you be'n buryin' ? " 

The man halted his hearse, and answered briefly, 
" Mirandy Holcomb." 

" Why, I thought the funeral wa'n 't to be till to- 
morrow ! Well, I declare," said the woman, as she 
reentered the room and sat down again in her rock- 
ing-chair, " I didn 't ask him whether it was Mr. 
Goodlow or Mr. Baldwin preached the sermon. 



 

I was so put out hearin' it was Mirandy, you might 
say I forgot to ask him anything. Mirandy was 
always a well woman till they moved down to the 
Mill Village and began takin' the hands to board, 
— so many of 'em. When I think of Lyddy's 
teachin' there another winter, — well, I could al- 
most rejoice that she was goin' away. She ain't a 
mite too strong as it is." 

Here the woman paused, and the old man struck 
in with his quaint treble while she fanned herself in 
silence : " I do suppose the voyage is goin' to be 
everything for her health. She 'll be from a month 
to six weeks gettin' to Try-East, and that 'll be a 
complete change of air, Mr. Goodlow says. And 
she won't have a care on her mind the whole way 
out. It 'll be a season of rest and quiet. I did wish, 
just for the joke of the thing, as you may say, that 
the ship had be'n goin' straight to Venus, and 
Lyddy could 'a' walked right in on 'em at breakfast, 
some morning. I should liked it to be'n a surprise. 
But there wa'n't any ship at Boston loadin' for 
Venus, and they didn 't much believe I 'd find one 
at New York. So I just took up with the captain 
of the Aroostook's offer. He says she can telegraph
