While Staniford walked up and down, and scorned 
and raged at the idea that he had anything to do 
with the matter, the singing and fluting came to a 
pause in the cabin ; and at the end of the next 
tune, which brought him to the head of the gang- 
way stairs, he met Lydia emerging. He stopped 
and spoke to her, having instantly resolved, at sight 
of her, not to do so. 

" Have you come up for breath, like a mer- 
maid ? " he asked. " Not that I 'm sure mermaids 
do." 

" Oh, no," said Lydia. " I think I dropped my 
handkerchief where we were sitting." 



 

Staniford suspected, with, a sudden return to a 
theory of her which he had already entertained, 
that she had not done so. Bat she went lightly by 
him, where he stood stolid, and picked it up ; and 
now he suspected that she had dropped it there on 
purpose. 

" You have come back to walk with me ? " 

" No !" said the girl indignantly. " I have not 
come back to walk with you ! " She waited a mo- 
ment ; then she burst out with, " How dare you 
say such a thing to me ? What right have you to 
speak to me so ? What have I done to make you 
think that I would come back to " — 

The fierce vibration in her voice made him know 
that her eyes were burning upon him and her lips 
trembling. He shrank before her passion as a man 
must before the justly provoked wrath of a woman, 
or even of a small girl. 

" I stated a hope, not a fact," he said in meek 
uncandor. " Don't you think you ought to have 
done so? " 

" I don't — I don't understand you," panted 
Lydia, confusedly arresting her bolts in mid-course. 

Staniford pursued his guilty advantage ; it was 
his only chance. " I gave way to Mr. Hicks when 
you had an engagement with me. I thought — you 
would come back to keep your engagement." He 
was still very meek. 

" Excuse me," she said with self-reproach that 
would have melted the heart of any one but a man 



 

who was in the wrong, and was trying to get out of 
it at all hazards. " I didn 't know what you meant 
— I" — 

" If I had meant what you thought," interrupted 
Staniford nobly, for he could now afford to be gen- 
erous, "I should have deserved much more than 
you said. But I hope you won't punish my awk- 
wardness by refusing to walk with me." 

He knew that she regarded him earnestly before 
she said, " I must get my shawl and hat." 

" Let me go ! " he entreated. 

" You couldn 't find them," she answered, as she 
vanished past him. She returned, and promptly 
laid her hand in his proffered arm ; it was as if she
