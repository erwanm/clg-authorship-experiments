"Will you?" said the hunchback, brightening up.

"Yes. I won't forget the service you have done me."

Rufus had hardly got out these words when Humpy clutched him violently
by the arm, and pulled him into a passageway, the door of which was open
to the street.

"What's that for?" demanded Rufus, inclined to be angry.

Humpy put his finger to his lip, and pointed to the street. On the
opposite sidewalk Rufus saw Smith sauntering easily along with a cigar
in his mouth.




CHAPTER XXIV.

HOW RUFUS GOT BACK.


It happened that Smith espied the man whom he wished to meet, from the
car-window, just as it turned into Canal Street. He got out, therefore,
and, adjourning to a whiskey saloon, the two discussed a matter of
business in which they were jointly interested, and then separated. Thus
Smith was enabled to return home sooner than he had anticipated. He
little suspected that his prisoner had escaped, as he walked
complacently by on the opposite sidewalk.

"It's lucky I saw him," said Humpy. "He might have nabbed us."

"He wouldn't have nabbed me," said Rufus, resolutely. "He'd have found
it hard work to get me back."

"He's stronger than you," said Humpy, doubtfully.

"I'd have called a copp, then," said Rufus, using his old word for
policeman.

"He'll kill me if he ever gets hold of me," said Humpy, shuddering. "He
horsewhipped me yesterday."

"Then he's a brute," said Rufus, who could not help feeling a degree of
sympathy for the deformed boy, who had done him such good service.

"He never did it before," said Humpy. "That's what made me turn against
him."

"And you won't go back to him?"

"Never!" said Humpy, decidedly. "He'll know I let you out."

"What's your name?" asked Rufus, remembering that he had never heard the
name of his guide.

"They call me Humpy," said the deformed boy, flushing a little. He had
got hardened to the name, he thought; but now that Rufus asked him, he
answered with a feeling of shame and reluctance.

"Haven't you another name? I don't like to call you that."

"My name is William Norton, but I've most forgot it, it's so long since
anybody ever called me so."

"Then I'll call you so. I like it better than the other. Have you made
up your mind what to do, now you've left your old place?"

"Yes, I'm going out West,--to Chicago maybe."

"Why do you leave New York?"

"I want to get away from him," said William, indicating his old
employer by a backward jerk of his finger. "If I stay here, he'll get
hold of me."

"Perhaps you are right; but you needn't go so far as Chicago.
Philadelphia would do."

"He goes there sometimes."
