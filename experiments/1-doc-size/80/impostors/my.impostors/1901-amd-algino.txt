Sylvie felt that, in some way, she had been defrauded of 
a triumph. 

“She is not going to marry any one. She has to stay 
with us until Gervaise comes back.” 

“But it would be dreadful for her to be an old maid ; 
such a pretty girl, too. Aunt Melanie thought of going 
into a convent. She was very religious. Then papa wanted 
her to come and take charge of the house, and she did. 
But I do not think Aunt Melanie ever could have been 
pretty.” 

“Angel is coming to live with me,” Sylvie said, proudly. 
“Ah, she had a secret that Hortense could not know.” 

“When you go back to France?” 

Sylvie nodded. 

“Oh, I shall be so sorry! But then I am older, and 
may have a lover of my own. Lucie Fleurien married, 
and went to Havana. Oh, what a grand wedding she 
had ! All the paths were strewn with flowers ; I mean to 




be married that way. Ah, if one could have a lover like 
the Count; but then he is very poor, and his people are 
no longer on the throne. I like a king best, don’t you ?” 

Sylvie was not at all sure. And she was glad Claire 
Lavalette liked the Count so well. Gervaise could not 
be always with her. 

As for Zenobie, she and Sylvie did not make much 
headway in friendship. 

“What you can see about the little child,” she said, 
loftily, to Hortense, “surprises me. A girl who nurses 
a crane and who is likely to grow up an ignoramus seems 
of very little account. Because she has long golden 
hair ” 

“She is not an ignoramus ! She can begin to talk quite 
well in Spanish; and she sews prettily. She can even 
embroider, and make lace. And they have some French 
poets they read aloud — she can repeat whole verses from 
them. Angel teaches her.” 

“Oh, Mam’selle Angelique is very grand, I believe. 
No doubt she is setting her cap for one of the Princes. 
Nothing less than a Prince will do.” 

Zenobie tossed her head. 

“That is very mean of you.” Hortense’s dark eyes 
flashed. 

“I suppose you are quite ready to put her in my place ! 
I can find another friend. But I did not think it of you, 
Hortense, when we have known each other all our lives!” 

There was a touch of upbraiding in the tone, and a 
certain pathos in the voice. They often had differences 
about one thing and another. 

“It is not that at all. We go to school and church 
together, and we are both Catholics. Father Moras said 
she was a heretic,” and the girl’s voice sank to a whisper. 
“So I pray for her every night, that she may be converted 




to the true faith. And he said it would be a most ex- 
cellent thing to get her to school to the nuns. When I 
am trying to follow the good priest's advice, it is very 
cruel in you to torment me.’'
