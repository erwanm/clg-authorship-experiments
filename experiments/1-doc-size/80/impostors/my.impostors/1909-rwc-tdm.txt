had always acted as his deputy, fought for him, conquered for him,
spoken for him, vouched for him--perhaps pleaded for him!--he shivered,
and suddenly he realised that this golden voice was, in fact, all there
was to him.

What had he to identify him on earth among mankind? Only his money.
Wherein did he differ from other men? He had more money. What had he to
offer as excuse for living at all? Money. What had he done? Lived on it,
by it. Why, then, it was the money that was entitled to distinction, and
he figured only as its parasite! Then he was nothing--even a little
less. In the world there was man and there was money. It seemed that he
was a little lower in the scale than either; a parasite--scarcely a
thing of distinction to offer Kathleen Severn.

Very seriously he looked up at the moon.

It was the day following his somewhat disordered and impassioned
declaration. He expected to receive his answer that evening; and he
descended the mountain in a curiously uncertain and perplexed state of
mind which at times bordered on a modesty painfully akin to humbleness.

Meanwhile, Duane was preparing to depart on the morrow. And that evening
he also was to have his definite answer to the letter which Kathleen had
taken to Geraldine Seagrave that morning.

    "Dear," he had written, "I once told you that my weakness needed
    the aid of all that is best in you; that yours required the best of
    courage and devotion that lies in me. It is surely so. Together we
    conquer the world--which is ourselves.

    "For the little things that seem to threaten our separation do not
    really alarm me. Even if I actually committed the inconsequential
    and casual thing that so abruptly and so deeply offended you, there
    remains enough soundness in me at the core to warrant your charity
    and repay, in a measure, your forgiveness and a renewal of your
    interest in my behalf.

    "Search your heart, Geraldine; question your intelligence; both will
    tell you that I am enough of a man to dare love you. And it takes
    something of a man to dare do it.

    "There is a thing that I might say which would convince you, even
    against the testimony of your own eyes, that never in deed or in
    thought have I been really disloyal to you since you gave me your
    heart.... Yet I must not say it.... Can you summon sufficient faith
    in me to accept that statement--against the evidence of those two
    divine witnesses which condemn me--your eyes? Circumstantial
    evidence is no good in this case, dear. I can say no more than that.

    "Dearest, what can compare to the disaster of losing each other?

    "I ask you to let me have the right to stand by you in your present
    distress and despondency. What am I for if not for such moments?

    "That night you were closer to the danger mark than you have ever
    been. I know that my conduct--at least your interpretation of
    it--threw you, for the moment off your guarded balance; but that
    your attitude toward such a crisis--your solution of such a
    situation--should be a leap forward toward self-destruction--a
    reckless surrender to anger and blind impulse, only makes me the
    more certain that we need each other now if ever.

    "The silent, lonely, forlorn battle that has been going on behind
    the door of your room and the doors of your heart during these last
    few days, is more than I can well endure. Open both doors to me;
    leagued we can win through!

    "Give me the right to be with you by night as well as by daylight,
    and we two shall stand together and see 'the day break and the
    shadows flee away.'"

That same evening his reply came:

    "My darling, Kathleen will give you this. I don't care what my eyes
    saw if you tell me it isn't true. I have loved you, anyway, all the
    while--even with my throat full of tears and my mouth bitter with
    anger, and my heart torn into several thousand tatters--oh, it is
    not very difficult to love you, Duane; the only trouble is to love
    you in the right way; which is hard, dear, because I want you so
    much; and it's so new to me to be unselfish. I began to learn by
