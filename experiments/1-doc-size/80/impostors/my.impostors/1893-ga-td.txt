thought the girl. "Would I regret if he no 
longer made me tremble, or would I go on my 
knees and thank the Blessed Virgin ?" Aloud 
she said, "It was strange for rtie to ask you 
such questions ; but it is as if you had some- 
thing in your mind separate from yourself, and 
that it would tell me, and you could not pre- 
vent its being truthful. I do not believe in 
you ; you look as if nothing were worth the 
while to lie or tell the truth about ; but your 
mind is quite different. It seems to me that it 
knows all things, that it is as cold and clear as 
ice.'' 

"What a whimsical creature you are ! My 
mind, like myself, — I feel as if I were twins, — 
is at your service. Forget that I am Diego 
Estenega. Regard me as a sort of archive of 
impressions which may amuse or serve you as 

the poorest of your books do. That they happen to be catalogued under the general title of 
Diego Estenega is a mere detail ; an accident, 
for that matter ; they might be pigeon-holed in 
the skull of a Bandini or a Pico. I happen to 
be the magnet, that is all." 

" If I could forget that you were an Este- 
nega, — just for a week, while you are here," 
she said, wistfully. 

"You are a woman of will and imagination, 
— also of variety. Make an experiment ; it 
will interest you. Of course there will be 
times when you will be bitterly conscious 
that I am the enemy of your house ; it would 
be idle to expect otherwise ; but when we 
happen to be apart from disturbing influences, 
let us agree to forget that we are anything but 
two human beings, deeply congenial. As for 
what I said in the garden at Monterey, the last 
time we spoke together, — I shall not bother 
you." 

" You no longer care ? " she exclaimed. 

"I did not say that. I said I should not 
bother you, — recognizing your hostility and 
your reasons. Be faithful to your traditions, 
my beautiful doomswoman. No man is worth 
the sacrifice of those dear old comrades. 
What presumption for a man to require you 

to abandon the cause of your house, give up 
your brother, sacrifice one or more of your 
religious principles; one, too, who would 
open his doors to the Americans you hate ! 
No man is worth such a sacrifice as that." 

" No," she said, "no man." But she said it 
without enthusiasm. 

" A man is but one ; traditions are fivefold, 
and multiplied by duty. Poor grain of sand — 
what can he give, comparable to the cold 
serene happiness of fidelity to self? Love is 
sweet, — horribly sweet, — but so common a 
madness can give but a tithe of the satisfac- 
tion of duty to pure and lofty ideals. " 

" I do not believe that. " The woman in her 
arose in resentment. " A life of duty must be 
empty, cold, and wrong. It was not that we 
were made for." 

"Let us talk Httle of love, senorita : it is a 
dangerous subject." 

"But it interests me, and I should like to 
understand it."
