“Oh, I know,” said Debby: — “‘The 
Lord seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance; but the 
Lord looketh on the heart.’ Then he’ll 
divide ’em by their hearts : won’t he?” 
“Yes,” said her mother; “for, ‘as a man 
thinketh in his heart, so is he.’ And the 
Lord will know what lives have been spent 
in loving service to him, and what have 
not. 

“And then shall he, the King of kings 
and Lord of lords, say unto them on
