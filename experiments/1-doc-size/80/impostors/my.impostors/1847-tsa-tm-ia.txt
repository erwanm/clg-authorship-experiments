" A very strange remark," said Mrs. Fielding. 

"And yet it expresses my views on the subject." 

' I should hardly think you had reflected much 
about it, and was merely acting from some anti- 
quated notion put into your head by Aunt Mary." 

" You err there very much, Mrs. Fielding. Since 
the birth of my daughter, the attainment of the best 
means for securing her happiness has been with me 
a source of deep reflection. I have brought to my 
aid the observations of my youth and mature years. 
What I have seen in real life confirms my rational 
deductions. I am well satisfied that it injures a 
young girl to throw her into company early. It is 
from this conviction that I act." 


"How can it injure her? I am at a loss to 
know," 

" It injures her in every thing, I was going to 
say." 

" Name a single particular." 

"It puts a woman's head upon a girl's shoul- 
ders, to use a common saying, while she lacks the 
strength to carry it steadily, but tosses the feathers 
with which it is dressed into every body's face that 
she meets." 

" O dear ! What a queer idea." 

" And not only that, Mrs. Fielding ; it exposes 
her, before she has the inielligence to discriminate 
accurately between the true and the false, to the 
danger of forming a wrong estimate of life and its 
duties — of being carried away by a love of dress 
and show and mere pleasure taking, while things 
of infinitely more importance are seen in an ob- 
scure light, and viewed as of little consequence. 
The manners of a girl who has gone into company 
too early are always offensive to me. There is a 
pertness about her that I cannot bear — a toss of the 
head, a motion of the body, an affected distortion 
of the countenance, (I can call it nothing else,) that 
is peculiarly disagreeable." 

''' You see a great deal more than I do, that is all 
I can say, Mrs. Hartley," replied Mrs. Fielding, a 



 

little gravely. She had, that very morning, fell 
called upon to rebuke Jane for the rude forwardness 
of her manners in company the evening previous ! 

"Perhaps I have thought more on the subject 
and, in consequence, observed more closely." 

" I don't know how that is — perhaps so" — was 
the visiter's rather cold reply. 

A new subject of conversation was then started. 
While they still sat conversing, Marien, who had 
gone out to attend to something, came in with little 
Lillian by the hand, now just five years old. Mrs. 
Fielding looked into her face with a new interest, 
observed her words closely, and watched every 
motion. Involuntary respect, and even admiration, 
were elicited. There was something innocent and 
like a child about her, and yet this was so blended 
with a womanly grace when she conversed, that, 
in spite of herself, she could not help contrasting 
her manner with the forward, familiar airs of her
