So intense were his feelings that he 
could not help betraying a part of them 
to Henriette. They sat in the garden 
one soft summer evening, with Henriette's 
mother occupied with her crocheting at 
a decorous distance. George, in reverent 
and humble mood, began to drop vague 
hints that he was really unworthy of his 
bride-to-be. He said that he had not 
always been as good as he should have 
been; he said that her purity and sweetness 
had awakened in him new ideals; so that 
he felt his old life had been full of blunders. 
Henriette, of course, had but the vaguest 
of ideas as to what the blunders of a tender 
and generous young man like George might 
be. So she only loved him the more for 
his humility, and was flattered to have 
such a fine effect upon him, to awaken in 
him such moods of exaltation. When he 



 

told her that all men were bad, and that 
no man was worthy of such a beautiful 
love, she was quite ravished, and wiped 
away tears from her eyes. 

It would have been a shame to spoil 
such a heavenly mood by telling the real 
truth. Instead, George contented him- 
self with telling of the new resolutions 
he had formed. After all, they were the 
things which really mattered; for Henriette 
was going to live with his future, not with 
his past. 

It seemed to George a most wonderful 
thing, this innocence of a young girl, 
which enabled her to move through a 
world of wickedness with unpolluted mind. 
It was a touching thing; and also, as a 
prudent young man could not help reahzing, 
a most convenient thing. He realized the 
importance of preserving it, and thought 
that if he ever had a daughter, he would 
protect her as rigidly as Henriette had been 
protected. He made haste to shy off from 
the subject of his '' badness'' and to turn 
the conversation with what seemed a clever 
jest. 



 

''If I am going to be so good' he said, 
"don't forget that you will have to be 
good also!'' 

"I will try," said Henriette, who was 
still serious. 

"You will have to try hard," he per- 
sisted. "You will find that you have a 
very jealous husband." 

"Will I?" said Henriette, beaming with 
happiness â€” 'for when a woman is very 
much in love she doesn't in the least 
object to the man's being jealous. 

"Yes, indeed," smiled George. "I'll 
always be watching you." 

"Watching me?" echoed the girl with 
a surprised look.
