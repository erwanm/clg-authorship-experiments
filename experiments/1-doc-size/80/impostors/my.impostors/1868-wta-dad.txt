The steamer stood up the Leck, and turned into the Merwe, which is a
branch five or six miles in length, connecting the Leck and the Waal. On
each side was a dike, of course; but the view from the steamer showed
only an ordinary bank. The top of it was broad, and occasionally there
was a neat cottage or a little inn upon the top of it. The roof or
chimney of a house beyond it was frequently observed, otherwise the
uninformed traveller would not have suspected the character of the
country. The embankment was studded with windmills, placed on the
highest ground, to give the sails the full benefit of the wind. Some of
them were used for grinding grain, some for sawing lumber, and others
for forcing the water up from the low ground into the river.

The steamer passed from the Merwe into the Waal, and stood up the river.
There was but little variation in the scenery. The wall of dikes on
either side was uninterrupted. Sometimes they were lined with rows of
trees, between which was the common road; at others they were bare and
naked. The captain of the steamer told them that a portion of the
country in the vicinity was lower than the bottom of the river. The
whole region seemed to be saturated with water, and the wonder is that
the people can go to bed at night with any assurance that they will not
be drowned out before morning.

"There is the Castle of Loevestein," said the captain of the boat, who
spoke good English, "and the fort below has the same name."

"Did you ever hear of it before?" asked Mr. Mapps, who was on the
lookout for places of historical interest, as he turned to a group of
seamen.

"You mentioned it this morning," replied one of the students.

"In what connection?"

"Some man had a wonderful escape from it," added another.

"Who was that man?"

"A Dutchman with a Latin name."

"Grotius, or De Groot," added Mr. Mapps. "The Stadtholder, Prince
Maurice, the boy general and ruler, wished to make himself hereditary
sovereign of the Netherlands, and was opposed by the judge, Barneveldt,
and Grotius. The prince carried the day; Barneveldt was executed, and
Grotius imprisoned in this castle, where he was kept nearly two years.
He was very strictly guarded at first; but his wife, finding that the
vigilance of the sentinels was relaxed, devised a scheme for effecting
his liberation. The books, papers, and linen of the prisoner were
conveyed to him in a large box, which the guards, having so often
searched in vain for contraband articles, at last neglected to examine.
The box, and the carelessness of the soldiers, suggested to the wife of
Grotius the means of getting her husband out of the castle.

"She prepared the chest by boring some holes in it, for the admission of
the air, and took her servant-girl into her confidence. The box was
conveyed to the apartment of Grotius, and the project explained to him.
He did not relish the idea of being shut up in a chest, and rolled about
in a boat; but his wife's entreaties prevailed over his scruples. It was
pretended that the box was filled with books which the learned man had
borrowed in Gorcum, the town which you see on the other side of the
river.

"The chest, containing the philosopher, was conveyed by the soldiers
down to the boat, in charge of the servant-girl. When one of them
complained of its weight, the man said it was the Arminian books which
were so heavy; for Grotius was an Arminian in his theology. The soldier
suggested that it was the Arminian himself; but this was intended as a
joke, and the box was tumbled into the boat. The servant made a signal
with her handkerchief to her mistress, who was looking out of the
window, to indicate that all was right.

"When the boat reached Gorcum, the box was conveyed to the house of a
friend of Grotius, of whom it was presumed that he had borrowed the
books. The servant-girl told him that her master was in the box, and
begged his assistance; but he was so terrified, in view of the
consequences, that he refused to have anything to do with the matter.
His wife, however, had more pluck in the service of a friend, and,
having sent all her domestics out of the house on various errands, she
opened the box, and released the philosopher from durance vile.
