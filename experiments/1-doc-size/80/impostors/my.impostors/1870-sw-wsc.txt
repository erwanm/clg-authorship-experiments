" O, I do, Mr. Richmond ! I do not like 
stoves at all. They're so close." 

" I always thought stoves were rather 



 

close," said Mr. Richmond. " Now what did 
you come to see me roast apples for, this 
afternoon ? Did you come to keep your 
promise ? " 

" Yes, sir," Matilda answered rather faintly 

" Are you sorry you made the promise ? " 
Mr. Richmond inquired, looking at her. 
But the look was so pleasant, that Matilda's 
could not keep its solemnity. She had come 
in with a good deal. 

" I don't know but I was soiry," she said. 

" And you are not sorry now ? " 

I think not." 

That is all the better. Now what did you 
want to say to me, Matilda ? " 

" You know you made me say I would 
come, Mr. Richmond." 

"Did I? I think not. I do not think I 
made you say anything do you think I 
did?" 

" Well, you asked me, Mr. Richmond." 

Just what did I ask you ? " 

" You asked rne if I would come and tell 



 

you you said you wished I would come and 
tell you if" 

And Matilda made a great pause. The 
eyes of her friend seemed only to be watching 
the apple, yet perhaps they knew that her 
little lips were unsteady and were trying to 
get steady. He left his seat to attend to the 
roast; got a plate and put on the hearth 
under it ; arranged the fire ; then came and 
with his own hands removed Matilda's hood 
and loosened and threw back her cloak ; and 
while he did this he repeated his question, in 
tones that were encouragement itself. 

" I wished you would come and tell me if 
if what?" 

" Yes, Mr. Richmond, if I thought I 
could not do something that I thought I 
ought." 

" Yes, I believe that was it, Tilly. Now, to 
begin with one thing at a time, what do you 
think you ' ought ' to do ? " 

" Last night, I mean, Mr. Richmond ; I 
mean, the night before last, at the meeting."
