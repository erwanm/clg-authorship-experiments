terrifying incident was in part because he read it in the capi- 
talist papers and did not believe it ; but mainly because his whole 
attention just now was centred on Eussia, where the prole- 
tariat was about to make its bid for power. Now you would 
see how wars were to be ended and peace restored to a distracted 
world ! 

The moderate Socialist government of Kerensky was plead- 
ing with the capitalist masters of the Allied nations for a 
statement of their peace terms, so that the workers of Eussia 
might know what they were fighting for. The Eussian workers 
wanted a declaration in favour of no annexations, no indemni- 
ties, and disarmament; on such terms they would help fight 
the war, in spite of all the starvation and suffering in distracted 
Eussia. But the Allied statesmen would not make any such 
declaration, and the Eussian workers, backed by all the Social- 
ists of the world, declared that the reason was that these Allied 
statesmen were waging an imperialist war they did not intend 
to stop fighting until they had taken vast territories from the 
German powers, and exacted a ransom that would cripple Ger- 
many for a generation. The Eussian workers refused point- 



 

blank to fight for such aims, and so in November came the 
second revolution, the uprising of the Bolsheviki. 

Almost their first action when they took possession of the 
palaces and government archives was to publish to the world 
the secret treaties which the rulers of England, France and 
Italy had made with Russia. These treaties formed a com- 
plete justification for the attitude of the Russian revolutionists 
they showed that the Allied imperialists had planned most 
shameless plundering ; England was to have the German colonies 
and Mesopotamia, France was to have German territory to the 
Rhine, Italy was to have the Adriatic coast, and to divide 
Palestine and Syria with England and France. 

And here was the most significant fact to Jimmie Higgins 
these enormously important revelations, the most important 
since the beginning of the war, were practically suppressed by 
the capitalist newspapers of America! First these papers 
printed a brief item the Bolsheviki had given out what they 
claimed were secret treaties, but the genuineness of these docu- 
ments was gravely doubted. Then they published evasive and 
lying denials from the British, French and Italian diplomats; 
and then they shut up ! Not another word did you read about 
those secret treaties; except for one or two American news- 
papers with traditions of honour, the full text of those treaties 
was given in the Socialist press alone ! And now, cried Jimmie 
Higgins, to the workingmen in his shop, what do you think of 
those wonderful Allies of ours? What do you think of those 
Wall Street newspapers of ours? Could any workingman who 
had such facts put before him fail to realise that Jimmie Hig- 
gins had a case, and a most important work in the world to do, 
in spite of all his unreason and his narrowness?

Jimmie was now in the seventh heaven, walking as if on 
air. A proletarian government at last, the first in history ! A 
government of workingmen like himself, running their own 
affairs, without the help of politicians or bankers! Coming 
out before the world and telling the truth about matters of 
state, in language that common men could understand! Dis- 
banding the armies, and sending the workers home! Turning 
the masters out of the factories, and putting shop-committees 





in control! Taking away the advertising from the crooked 
capitalist papers, and so putting them out of business! Our 
little friend would rush to the corner every morning to get the 
paper and see what had happened next ; he would go down the
