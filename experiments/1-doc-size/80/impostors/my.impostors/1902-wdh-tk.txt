sight ; she had a lax, formless mouth, and an anxious 
sniile, with which she constantly watched her son 
for his initiative, while she recollected herself from 
time to time, long enough to smooth Ellen 's hand 
between her own, and say, " Oh, I just think the 
world of Clarence ; and I guess he thinks his mother 
is about right, too," and then did not heed what 
Ellen answered. 

The girl said very little, and it was Bittridge 
who talked for all, dominating the room with a 
large, satisfied presence, in which the judge sat 
withdrawn, his forehead supported on his hand, and 
his elbow on the table. Mrs. Kenton held herself 
upright, with her hands crossed before her, steal 
ing a look now and then at her daughter 's averted 
face, but keeping her eyes from Mrs. Bittridge, who, 
whenever she caught Mrs. Kenton 's glance, said 
something to her about her Clarence, and how 
he used to write home to her at Ballardsville about 
the Kentons, so that she felt acquainted with all of 
them. Her reminiscences were perfunctory; Mrs. 
Bittridge had voluntarily but one topic, and that 
was herself, either as she was included in the in 
terest her son must inspire, or as she included him 
in the interest she must inspire. She said that, 
now they had met at last, she was not going to 
rest till the Kentons had been over to Ballardsville, 
and made her a good, long visit; her son had some 
difficulty in making her realize that the Kentona 
were going to Europe. Then she laughed, and 



 

said she kept forgetting; and she did wish they were 
all coming back to Tuskingum. 

If it is a merit to treat a fatuous mother with 
deference, Bittridge had that merit. His deference 
was of the caressing and laughing sort, which 
took the spectator into the joke of her peculiarities 
as something they would appreciate and enjoy with 
him. She had been a kittenish and petted person 
in her youth, perhaps, and now she petted herself, 
after she had long ceased to be a kitten. What 
was respectable and what was pathetic in her was 
her wish to promote her son 's fortunes with the 
Kentons, but she tried to do this from not a very 
clear understanding of her part, apparently, and 
little sense of the means. For Ellen 's sake, rather 
than hers, the father and mother received her over 
tures to their liking kindly; they answered her pa 
tiently, and Mrs. Kenton even tried to lead the 
way for her to show herself at her best, by talking 
of her journey on to New York, and of the city, and 
what she would see there to interest her. Lottie 
and Boyne, sternly aloof together in one of their 
momentary alliances, listened to her replies with a 
silent contempt that almost included their mother; 
Kenton bore with the woman humbly and sadly. 

He was, in fact, rather bewildered with the situ 
ation, for which he felt himself remotely if not 
immediately responsible. Bittridge was there among 
them not only on good terms, but apparently in the 
character of a more than tolerated pretendant to 
Ellen 's favor. There were passages of time in which 



 

the father was not sure that the fellow was not 
engaged to his daughter, though when these 
instants were gone he was aware that there had 
been no overt love-making between them and Bit- 
tridge had never offered himself. What was he 
doing there, then? The judge asked himself that,
