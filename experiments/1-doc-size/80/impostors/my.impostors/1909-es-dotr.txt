He had honest eyes, a slight moustache, and 
a careful manner. "Monsieur," he con 
tinued to Welden, "at Chantilly, I have some 
stables, oh, nothing to speak of, but a little 
stretch which is, perhaps, sufficient, and these 
gentlemen, with Kara Saraguine, whom I 
do not see at this moment, have been arranging a hurdle-race for the sixth. If now you, 
monsieur, will be amiable enough to enter, 



 

it will become truly an international run. 
Prince Kara is Russian, the Marquis 
Aquaviva is " 

"I should like nothing better," Welden 
cut in. "But on the sixth, I have arranged 
to be at M. de Malakoff's." 

"And most amiable it is of you," Mala- 
koff exclaimed. "I thank you infinitely, 
but" 

"I have also," Cantire, in English, interrupted. "We can send our horses to Chantilly before we go, and run up from Deauville together." 

"Voyons!" said Malakoff. "Shall we not 
talk French? De Dol does not understand, 
or Aquaviva either." 

"Pardon, yes, a very little," the count softly interposed. Then lapsing serenely into 
French he added: "As a baby, I studied it

Welden, turning to him, with his laughing 
eyes, nodded. "Yes, thanks, it ought to be 
very good fun." 

"Well, then, what would a little cut at 
baccarat say to you, messieurs?" Malakoff 
in his rich voice inquired. "Ah! behold 
Cantire, who abandons us now." 

For Cantire, rightly preferring the nobler 
possibilities of captivating women, to the 
more sordid chance of winning gold, was 
then making for the frisk. 

"A hundred louis," Malakoff resumed. 
"It is I who am banker. If you please, this 
way." 

He motioned at a footman and a door was 
opened to a f umoir where an oval table was 
set, and where presently Welden, to whom 
he dealt practically nothing but eights 
and nines, relieved him of a major portion 
of the money. 



 

Malakoff laughed and got up. "Bah! 
Another time it will be my turn." 

But now Aquaviva took the bank. Other 
men, drifting in, staked against him. Weiden continued to play and continued to win. 
Meanwhile Malakoff had gone. De Dol,
