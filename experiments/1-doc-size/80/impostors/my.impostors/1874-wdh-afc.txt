and characters, fortifying her statements by refer 
ence of doubtful points to her daughter. This oc 
cupied some time, and Ferris listened to it all with 
an abstracted air. At last he said, with a smile, 
" There was an Italian priest came to see me this 
morning, who astonished me by knowing English 
with a brogue that he d learned from an Eng 
lish priest straight from Dublin ; perhaps he might 
do, Mrs. Vervain ? He's professionally pledged, 
you know, not to give the kind of annoyance 
you've suffered from in teachers. He would do as 
well as Padre Girolamo, I suppose." 

" Do you really ? Are you in earnest ? " 

" Well, no, I believe I'm not. I haven 't the 
least idea he would do. He belongs to the church 
militant. He came to me with the model of a 
breech-loading cannon he's invented, and he want 
ed a passport to go to America, so that he might 
offer his cannon to our government." 

" How curious ! " said Mrs. Vervain, and her 
daughter looked frankly into Ferris's face. "But 
I know ; it's one of your jokes." 

" You overpraise me, Mrs. Vervain. If I could 
make such jokes as that priest was, I should set 



 

up for a humorist at once. He had the touch of 
pathos that they say all true pieces of humor ought 
to have," he went on instinctively addressing him 
self to Miss Vervain, who did not repulse him. 
" He made me melancholy ; and his face haunts 
me. I should like to paint him. Priests are gen 
erally such a snuffy, common lot. And I dare 
say," he concluded, "he's sufficiently commonplace, 
too, though he didn t look it. Spare your romance, 
Miss Vervain." 

The young lady blushed resentfully. " I see as 
little romance as joke in it," she said. 

" It was a cannon," returned Ferris, without 
taking any notice of her, and with a sort of ab 
sent laugh, " that would make it very lively for the 
Southerners if they had it. Poor fellow ! I sup 
pose he came with high hopes of me, and expected 
me to receive his invention with eloquent praises. 
I've no doubt he figured himself furnished not only 
with a passport, but with a letter from me to Pres 
ident Lincoln, and foresaw his own triumphal entry 
into Washington, and his honorable interviews with 
the admiring generals of the Union forces, to whom 
he should display his wonderful cannon. Too bad ; 
isn t it?" 

" And why didn 't you give him the passport and 
the letter ? " asked Mrs. Vervain. 

" Oh, that's a state secret," returned Ferris. 

" And you think he won 't do for our pur 
pose ? " 




"I don 't indeed." 

" Well, I'm not so sure of it. Tell me something 
more about him." 

" I don 't know anything more about him. Be 
sides, there isn t time."
