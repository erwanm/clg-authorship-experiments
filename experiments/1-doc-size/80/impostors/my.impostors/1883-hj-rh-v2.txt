The next day, while he was at home, the servant 
brought him the card of a visitor. He read with surprise 
the name of Mrs. Hudson, and hurried forward to meet 
her. He found her in his sitting-room, leaning on the 
arm of her son and looking very pale, her eyes red with 



 

weeping and her lips tightly compressed. Her advent 
puzzled him, and it was not for some time that he began 
to understand the motive of it. Roderick 's countenance 
threw no light upon it ; but Roderick 's luminous visage 
had never had any power of projecting its radiance. He 
had not been in Rowland 's rooms for several weeks, and 
he immediately began to look at those of his own works 
that adorned them. He gave himself up to independent 
contemplation. Mrs. Hudson had evidently armed her 
self with dignity, and so far as she might she meant to 
be impressive. Her success, however, may be measured 
by the fact that Rowland 's whole attention centred in 
the fear of seeing her begin to weep. She told him that 
she had come to him for practical advice ; she took leave 
to remind him that she was a stranger in the land. 
Where were they to go, please ? What were they to do ? 
Rowland glanced at Roderick, but Roderick had his back 
turned, and, with his head on one side, like a tourist in a 
church, was gazing at his splendid Adam. " 

"Roderick says he doesn 't know, he doesn 't care," 
Mrs. Hudson said; "he leaves it entirely to you." 

Many another man, in Rowland 's place, would have 
greeted this information with an irate and sarcastic laugh, 
and told his visitors that he thanked them infinitely for 
their confidence, but that really as things stood now they 
must settle these little matters between themselves ; many 
another man might have so comported himself, even if, 
like Rowland, he had been in love with Mary Garland 
and pressingly conscious that her destiny was also part 
of the question. But Rowland swallowed all hilarity and 
all sarcasm, and entered into Mrs. Hudson 's dilemma. 
His wits, however, were but indifferently at his com 
mand ; they were dulled by his sense of the singular 
change that had taken place in the attitude of this be 
wildered woman. Her visit was evidently intended as a 
formal reminder of forgotten vows. Mrs. Hudson was 
doubtless too sincerely humble a person to suppose that 



 

if he had had the wicked levity to break faith with her, 
her imponderable presence would operate as a chastise 
ment. But by some diminutive logical process of her 
own she had convinced herself that she had been weakly 
trustful, and that she had suffered Rowland to think too 
meanly not only of her understanding but of her social 
consequence. A visit in her best gown would have an 
admonitory effect as regards both of these attributes ; it 
would cancel some favours received, and show him that 
she was not incapable of grasping the theory, at least, 
of retribution ! These were the reflections of a very shy 
woman, who, determining for once in her life to hold up 
her head, was actually flying it like a kite. 

" You know we have very little money to spend," she 
said, as Rowland remained silent. "Roderick tells me 
that he has debts, and nothing at all to pay them with. 
He says I must write to Mr. Striker to sell my house for 
what it will bring and send me out the money. When 
the money comes I must give it to him. I am sure I 
don 't know ; I never heard of anything so dreadful ! 
My house is all I have. But that is all Roderick will 
say. We must be very economical." 

Before this speech was finished Mrs. Hudson 's voice
