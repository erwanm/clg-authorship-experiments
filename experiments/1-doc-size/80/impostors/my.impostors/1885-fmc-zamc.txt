at once to Ecbatana to meet Phraortes, or at least to 
inquire into the state of affairs in the city. She knew 
that no one could outride Zoroaster, and that there 
was nothing to be done but to await the issue. It was 
not possible to send a word of warning to her agent 
— he must inevitably take his chance, and if his con- 
duct attracted suspicion, he would, in all probability, 
be at once put to death. She believed that, even in 
that event, she could easily clear herself; but she 
resolved, if possible, to warn him as soon as he 
reached Shushan, or even to induce the king to be 
absent from the palace for a few days at the time 
when Phraortes might be expected. There was 
plenty of time — at least eleven days. 

Meanwhile, a desperate struggle was beginning 
within her, and the letter her woman had brought her 
hastened the conclusion to which her thoughts were 
rapidly tending. 

She felt keenly the fact that Zoroaster, who had 
been so cold to her advances in former days, had 



 

preferred before her a Hebrew woman, and was now 
actually so deeply in love with Nehushta, that he 
could not leave the palace for a few days without 
writing her a word of love — he, who had never loved 
any one ! She fiercely hated this dark woman, who 
was preferred before her by the man she secretly 
loved, and whom the king had brutally declared to 
be the most beautiful woman in the world. She 
longed for her destruction as she had never longed for 
anything in her life. Her whole soul rose in bitter 
resentment; not only did Zoroaster love this black- 
eyed, dark-browed child of captivity, but the king, 
who had always maintained that Atossa was un- 
equalled in the world, even when he coldly informed 
her that he would never trust her, now dared to say 
before Zoroaster, almost before Nehushta herself, that 
the princess was the more beautiful of the two. The 
one man wounded her in her vanity, the other in her 
heart. 

It would not be possible at present to be revenged 
upon the king. There was little chance of eluding 
his sleepless vigilance, or of leading him into any 
rash act of self-destruction. Besides, she knew him 
too well not to understand that he was the only man 
alive who could save Persia from further revolutions, 
and keep the throne against all comers. She loved 
power and the splendour of her royal existence, per- 
haps more than she loved Zoroaster. The idea of 
another change in the monarchy was not to be 
thought of, now that Darius had subdued Babylon. 
She had indeed a half-concerted plan with Phraortes 
to seize the power in Media in case the kino: were 



 

defeated in Babylonia, and the scroll she had so 
imprudently forgotten that very morning was merely 
an order to lay aside all such plans for the present, 
since the king had returned in triumph. 

As far as her conscience was concerned, Atossa 
would as soon have overthrown and murdered the 
king to gratify the personal anger she felt against 
him at the present moment, as she would have wrecked 
the universe to possess a jewel she fancied. There 
existed in her mind no idea of proportion between 
the gratification of her passions and the means sne 
might employ thereto ; provided one gratification did 
not interfere with another which she always saw 
beyond. Nothing startled her on account of its mere
