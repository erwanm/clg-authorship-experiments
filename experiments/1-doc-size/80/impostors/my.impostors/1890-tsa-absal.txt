close behind me, I plunged head foremost into the waves, 

! and swam under water as long as I could ; then I lifted 

 my head, and looked round at my persecutors. The old 

 man, up to his chin in the water, was only about ten steps 

behind me, and in the act of hurling his spear through my 

 body, when a wave, rolling over me, rescued my life, and 

In hurled him and his companion upon the beach. I now 

swam as quickly as possible towards the vessel, and spite 



 

of the gigantic breakers that broke ove- me, I reached it, 
and was dragged half unconscious into the boat by the 
sailors. 

Completely exhausted, I could not see what ensued upon 
the shore, but I learnt from my men that my pursuers 
stood like statues at the water's edge until they saw me 
safe in the vessel. Then they rushed upon the poor sailor, 
pierced him through the heart with a spear, and withdrew 
immediately with every thing they had found. When I 
came to myself again, I saw the bloody corse of the sailor 
stretched out upon a sand hill, and was indescribably 
pained at the thought that perhaps I had caused his death 
by my flight ; and although calmer reflection has convinceif 
me that my death would have been the ruin of my thought 
less companions, still the remembrance of the murder ot 
the poor fellow, who owed his death to sympathy for m 
embitters my thoughts to this hour. 



After this cruel murder, we no longer had the shghtest 
doubt that the savages would return in greater force, and 
that we should all share the fate of our poor companion 
as soon as they could succeed in overpowering us in any 
way. The wind was blowing strong, and the waves broke 
thirty feet high upon the wreck ; any hope of gaining the , 
open sea, in our frail boat, was more than doubtful, for 
tossed about by the waves, now against the sand bank, and 
now against the wreck, it was bent like an old basket, and 
leaked so badly that two men could scarcely keep it empty 
by the most diligent bailing. Still, a' there was no other 


heavy with storms. The wind blew more fiercely from 
the north-east, and about midnight the waves raged so that 
that the boat was half full of water. All hands were 
occupied in bailing it out with hats and shoes and we 
believed our last hour was at hand. The sea rushed 
through the holes and seams of our craggy skiff and the 
nails that I had driven in on shore appeared to keep their 
hold only by the pressure of the water on the outside. 
Sharp, blinding flashes of lightning darted through the 
gloom and added to the horrors of our situation. 

All courage now forsook the crew, and they declared it 
useless to exert themselves to keep the boat empty, as it 
must, in spite of all our labor, fill and sink. Some even 
dipped their heads in the sea to find out what effect the 
water would have upon them, and whether drowning werf 
really painful; others began to prepare themselves fol 
death, and to pray for forgiveness for their sins. This 
hour of trial was fearful, and I was scarcely able, by my 
entreaties and example, to induce them to continue to paS. 
the boat. Thus passed this dreadful night, in which out 
burning thirst, increased by our exertions, was not the 
least part of our misery, and we could only moisten out 
lips with 5 few drops of wine. 

The storm continued through the whole of the following
