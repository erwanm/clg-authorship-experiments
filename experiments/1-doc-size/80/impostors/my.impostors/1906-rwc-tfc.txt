" Then " 

"Well?" 

" How long are you going to keep me at arm's 
length? " he asked violently."



 

" That lies with you," she said, smihng. She looked 
at him for a moment, then, resting her hands on her 
hips, she began to pace the floor, to and fro, to and 
fro, and at every turn she raised her head to look at 
him. All the strange gi-ace of her became insolent prov- 
ocation — her pale eyes, clear, limpid, harbouring no de- 
lusions, haunted with the mockery of wisdom, challenged 
and checked him. " Howard," she said, " why should 
I be the fool j'ou want me to be because I love you? 
Why should I be even if I wished to he? You desire 
an understanding? Voilal You have it. I love you; 
I never misunderstood you from the first; I could not 
afford to. You know what I am; you know what you 
arouse in me ? " 

Slim, pale, depraved in all but body she stood, eye- 
ing him a moment, the very incarnation of vicious per- 
versity. 

" You know what you arouse in me," she repeated. 
" But don't count on it ! " 

" You have encouraged — permitted me to count — " 
His anger choked him — or was it the haunting wisdom 
of her eyes that committed him to silence. 

" I don't know," she said, musingly, " what it is in 
you that I am so mad about — whether it is your brutal- 
ity, or the utter corruption of you that holds me, or 
your wicked eyes of a woman, or the fascination of the 
mask you turn on the world, and the secret visage, naked 
in its vice, that you resem'e for me. But I love you — 
in my own fashion. Count on that, Howard; for that 
is all you can surely count on. And now, at last, you 
know." 

As he stood there, it came to him slowly that, deep 
within him he had always known this ; that he had never 
really counted on anything else though he had throt- 









tied his doubts by covering hei' throat with diamonds. 
Her strangeness, her pallor, her acquiescence, the deli- 
cate hint of depravity in her, the subtle response to all 
that was worst in him had attracted him, only to learn, 
little by little, that the taint of corruption was only a 
taint infecting others, not her; that the promise of evil 
was only a promise; that he had to deal with a young 
body but an old intelligence, and a mind so old that 
at moments her faded gaze almost appalled him with 
its indolent clairvoyance. 

Long since he knew, too, that in all the world he 
could never again find such a mate for him. This had, 
unadmitted even to himself, always remained a hidden 
secret within this secret man — an unacknowledged, un- 
drawn-on reserve in case of the failure which he, even 
in sanguine moods, knew in his inmost corrupted soul 
that his quest was doomed to. 

And now he had no more need of secrets from him-
