had come like a god ; he went like a cur. 

Philip Surbridge approached Miss Lauriat's 
house, happily humming a tune ; he found it 
was the pretty air that Dan used to sing with 
Trixy. Miriam heard it before he rang, and 
her whirling brain seemed to stop spinning. 
He was shown directly into the room, and 
found her as Steele had left her. Her white 
dress, with its black finish of velvet at the 
throat, had a dark stain over the heart. 

One glance at the burden on her lap ex- 



 

plained everything to Philip, and it was like 
him to ask no unnecessary questions. His 
own color changed, but the man seemed to 
fortify himself for a position in which his 
heart and his head must race together. 

" Philip," began Miriam brokenly. " Oh, 
Philip " — 

" You need not try to explain anything," 
said Philip gently. " I understand. I under- 
stand it all." 

" But Dr. Steele says — what does Dr. 
Steele mean ? " 

" So Steele has been here, has he ? " 

" Yes — he came — yes ; he did not — did 
not stay." 

" Then it is all out. I suppose in that case 
I may as well speak, now. Shall I? Do you 
wish me to ? — Or not ? It is for you to 
say what I shall do in these difficult circum- 
stances." 

" You must ! " cried Miriam. " I must 
know the worst." In her vehemence she 
aroused the dog, who stirred and looked at 
her drowsily. Philip drew his chair close to 
hers, and for the first time in his life tenderly 
patted her hand. 



 

He spoke a few encouraging words ; what, 
he hardly knew ; what, she scarcely heard. 
He tried to convince her that the worst was 
over ; and nothing more to fear. But Miriam 
interrupted impatiently. 

" Nothing but the whole truth will help 
me now. And there is nobody but you to 
give it to me." 

" Very well," said Philip in a changed tone. 
" You shall have it then. Here it is." He 
drew out from his pocket a beautiful silver 
collar, tarnished and bent. The plate had not 
been removed, and it bore this inscription : 



Cako. Licensed. No. 2001.
