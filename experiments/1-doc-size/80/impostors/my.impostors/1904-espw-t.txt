now. 

" I can't go back ! " he cried ; then in a 
different tone, " I won't go back ! " 

He ran down the long gray steps and into 
the street. This he crossed quickly, but with 
an aimless movement. His mind was in a 
whirlpool of indecision. He seemed to be 
swirling nearer and nearer — to what ? A 
gulf ? or a rescue ? The familiar blue cars of 
his suburban street passed him without 
appealing to his attention. He walked because 
he must walk, and he walked a long time. It 



 

occurred to him at last that he was headed 
towards home, and, with a clutch at the heart, 
he felt that it was the only place where he 
could go. By this time the pallid sun had 
been gulped by massing clouds, and a dark 
storm was imminent. Olin bent his head, and 
pushed his way into it. The surcharged air, 
like his surcharged emotion, lashed him on. 
He felt that no tempest could be fierce 
enough to flush the imagination that tormented 
him. It seemed to him that he would 
have offered up his soul if he could have been 
born without sensitiveness — like that big- 
eared fellow for instance. He was lacerated, 
and he must be healed. He pushed on me- 
chanically. The blue cars passed him. Be- 
fore he was aware of it, he had reached the 
group of stately elms at the corner of his 
father's street. He had tramped six miles. 
As he turned in at the long avenue, his dog 
— a fine St. Bernard — leaped upon him with 
boisterous caresses. He was so absorbed that 
he did not return them, and the dog, droop- 
ing, followed him wistfully. 

Olin fitted his latch-key with trembling 
hand, and went into his father's house. The 

dog remained on the porch. Afterwards he 
remembered that he must have shut the door 
in Barry's face. 

" Why, my son ! " his mother called from 
somewhere, " I didn't expect you until night." 

Olin murmured something unintelligibly, 
tossed off his dripping hat, and went upstairs 
to his own room. Then he locked the door, 
and there he remained until night. His mo- 
ther came up and knocked gently. 

" I am sorry, mother," he pleaded, " I 
can't see you now. Please let me alone." 

His sister, who was a very modern girl, 
came and whistled like a boy through the key- 
hole. 

" Go away, Jess," he said, " don't bother 
me." 

These were women, and easy to manage. 
The boy reflected that his father and brother 
were yet to come home, and that with them 
he must absolutely reckon. 

At dinner time nothing had been heard 
from him. His troubled mother, with the pa- 
thetic patience of her sex, had watched for 
the light in his windows, but these were still 
dark. She could contain her anxiety no longer,
