"Do you run this thing yourself?" asked Gwynne, as they boarded the
launch, which was at anchor by the end of the sea wall at the foot of
Russian Hill.

"Rather. How do you expect me to make a fortune in this paradise of the
labor-union if I don't do things myself? I have a hard time being
economical, and I suspect that where I save once I spend twice, but I
try not to think about it. Theories make life so palatable! This old
launch belonged to Uncle Hiram. I had it repaired, and take my eggs to
the hatcheries and my produce to Rosewater three times a week. There I
deal direct with the San Francisco buyers--and in this launch; it serves
me very well as an office. Then I come down in it every week. The
railroad is exorbitant, and the boats are too slow. It may be that
gasolene and repairs cost more than a railroad fare once a week, but I
have abstained from making a comparison. The trip is so delightful!"

The launch was about twenty feet long with a small cabin and a fresh
coat of brown paint. It shot lightly over the smooth water, and Gwynne
sat on top of the cabin above Isabel swinging his long legs, and looked
with some envy at the hundreds of yachts that skimmed the bay. They
appeared and vanished about the corners of the Islands and promontories
like birds swooping after prey. The Islands and all the mainland had
lost their greens long since, but the burnt grasses shone in the sun
like hammered gold; were tan and brown and fawn on the shadowed eastern
slopes. The chain of mountains beyond the towns across the bay and
facing San Francisco glittered like bronze, but the lofty volcanic peak
of Monte Diablo, farther still, was a pale and misty blue. North of the
Golden Gate and high above the mountains of Marin County, Mount
Tamalpais was so intense and hard a blue, and was cut against the
fleckless sky with so sharp an outline, that it produced in Gwynne a
vague sense of unreality and uneasiness. The Marconi poles on the summit
looked like the masts of a mammoth ship, and every window of The Tavern,
close by them, shone like a plate of brass.

They steered for the southern point of Angel Island, and Gwynne looked
about him with much interest. The mainland of the great northern cove
and the eastern side of the Islands were thick with trees: oaks,
buckeye, willows, madro√±o. And almost as thickly set, although sometimes
half hidden, were the villas: light and airy of architecture, gayly
painted, with broad verandas and overhanging vines. At the foot of
Belvedere and the little town of Tiburon were house-boats, in which
people lived for eight months of the year.

And everywhere, people, people, people. They swarmed in the yachts, on
the house-boats, on the driveways, the verandas. Gwynne twisted about
and looked at San Francisco. The palaces were on the heights and in the
Western Addition--out towards the Presidio and the Golden Gate; but
hundreds of tiny dwellings clung to the precipitous sides of Telegraph
Hill and Russian Hill as if their foundations were talons. And each had
its bit of garden, or its balcony full of flowers. Telegraph Hill, the
great bluff where the city turned almost at a right angle from north to
south, was given over largely to Mexicans and Italians, and was
uncommonly vivid. And the streets were full of people. The city had
turned itself inside out. Everywhere were bright gowns and parasols,
whizzing cars packed to the rails.

And the wealthy class by no means monopolized the bay with their yachts
and luxurious launches. There were fishing-smacks filled with whole
families of Italians and Chinese; in fact every tongue floated over the
water in the course of a brilliant Sunday afternoon. And at the docks
there were steamers, sailing vessels, from all the ports of the world, a
forest of spars and funnels; odd little Italian craft and even a Chinese
junk. A man-of-war was coming down from Mare Island. Gwynne had seen a
big Australian liner flying the Union Jack enter the Golden Gate as the
launch rounded Angel Island. It made him homesick, and he was not sorry
to lose sight of it.

They passed steamboats crowded with holiday seekers coming home from a
day's outing in Sausalito, San Rafael, Mill Valley, sporting parks; the
majority noisy and vulgar, but a mass of color. It was a scene of
surpassing variety, life, gayety, prosperity, importance. Gwynne, as the
light electrical breeze began to prick his veins, experienced a
sensation of pride in the country where his lines were cast, in those
ancestors of his that had memorably helped to develop its vast
resources: a tremendous concession, for he had barely acknowledged these
ancestors before. A slight meed of resignation descended upon him. He
smiled down upon Isabel, who was frowning at the sun and sighing for
her forgotten veil; she had a tender regard for her complexion. Gwynne
