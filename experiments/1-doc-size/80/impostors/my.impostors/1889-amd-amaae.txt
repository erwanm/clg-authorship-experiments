rows. It was delightful table-corn ; and, though we 
had supplied some of our neighbors, still a great deal 
had hardened ; but the chickens were crazy over it, 
so I found it no loss ; indeed, I thought it the most 
profitable of any. I felt another year I could do 
better still, with a judicious amount of fertilizer. 
Then we had no end of canned-fruit, and two bushels 
of pears laid away to keep, though I found they 
ripened up rather fast. I also tried some experi 
ments with grapes, of which we had an abundance, 



 

though not so many that bunched handsomely. We 
had made blackberry cordial, and three gallons of 
grape wine. 

Our pullets were coming on nicely. Three or four 
of the white Leghorns laid at five months, and some 
of the mixed ones. We had about ten beautiful 
light Brahmas, and began to average syc or eight 
eggs a day. We had a customer in New York for 
all our white Leghorn eggs at forty cents a dozen 
for the season. Of our old hens we had but five 
left, and they were good for another year. We 
resolved to force them all to their utmost, and see 
what we could do. The front of both houses was 
nearly all of glass, and had a southern exposure ; 
was good and warm and dry. 

Joe had not quite finished his work next door, 
but he was still kept busy. Indeed, on a rainy 
day, Joe and Bess were in great demand at the sta 
tion : then, there would be employment about the 
new buildings, so it did not seem worth while to go 
back to telegraphing. And I began to mistrust that 
Joe was dreaming of a home and a somebody, as he 
had once suggested. He was always escorting Ruth 
Montgomery somewhere, and it seemed as if she was 
not averse. Joe was too young and too poor to 
think of such a future ; but, after all 

" No, don't let us interfere," Eve had said. " If 



 

she should like Joe, she will wait; and I begin to 
think she will not do for Pryor. He needs a more 
stirring wife, a kind of stylish society girl, who 
will help him get rich." 

"And Joe needs a wife to keep him poor," I 
laughed. 

" No : Ruth might help him. There would be so 
many little ways, and he would make her very happy. 
Oh, what nonsense ! Well, let us neither make nor 
mar." 

I looked at him now, and the honest manliness 
shining in his eyes touched me. 

" This is solid comfort," he said presently, with a 
long breath. " When I have a house, I shall have 
a grate or a fireplace." 

We had started our heater, but so far had not 
needed much fire. This in the -reception-room was 
a luxury. We had settled again in our regular 
sleeping-rooms, though we all declared ourselves 
ready to vacate at the appearance of a crowd. But 
the girls were very busy with approaching wed 
dings. Even Sadie Brooke's had been set down for 
Christmas Eve. 

We were very happy, even if life had narrowed.
