and make a living, that is all. He has plenty to start 
with, and tells me he is doing fairly well, in spite of the 
times. But he would do better in the long run as a 



 

clerk. In time he might get a large salary as a sort of 
general director of all the routine business of some large 
house " 

Alexina curled her lip. "I do not want him to be a 
clerk." 

"No, of course you don't! But you'd like it still less 
if he cleaned you out. You would have to sell or rent 
your old home and live on a hundred and fifty dollars 
a month in a flat in some out-of-the-way quarter. You 
might have to go to work yourself. ' ' 

"I shouldn't mind that so much, except that I'm 
afraid I 'd not be good for much. Perhaps it was snobbish of me to object to Morty's being a clerk. But . . . 
well, I'm not so sure that it is snobbish to prefer what 
you have always been accustomed to â€” I mean if it is a 
higher standard. And after all I married him when he 
was only a clerk." 

"You are surprisingly little of a snob, all things considered ; but you are a hopeless aristocrat. ' ' 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"I think the line between the aristocratic and the 
snobbish attitude of mind is almost too fine to be put 
into words. But they are often confused by the undiscriminating. "Will you revoke that power of attorney on 
Monday?" 

"Shouldn't I wait until Morty is home? . . . tell him 
first ? It seems rather taking an advantage . . . and he 
will be very angry." 

"That doesn't matter." 

"What excuse shall I give him?" 

"Any one of a dozen. You are bored and want to 
take care of your money . . . intend to learn something 
of business, as all women should, and will in time. . . . 
Ring in the feminist stuff . . . wife's economic independence . . . woman's new position in the world. . . . 
That will make Morty so raving angry that he will forget 
about the other. Will you do it ? " 

"Yes, I will. I believe you are right. So were the 
others . . . there must be something in it. ' ' 

She told Gora of the advice of Tom Abbott and Judge 
Lawton. Gora nodded. 



 

"They meant more than they said. And merely because they are men of the world, not because they like 
and trust Morty any the less." 

Alexina did not hear her. She was staring hard at the 
floor. ... A year ago . . . three months ago . . . she 
couldn't have done this thing. She had been still under 
the illusion that she loved her husband, that her marriage was a complete success. She would have sacrificed 
her last penny rather than hurt his feelings. Now she 
only cared that she didn't care. . . . She had admitted 
to herself that she did not love her husband but that was 
different from committing an overt act that proved it. 
. . . She felt something crumbling within her. ... It 
was the last of the fairy edifice of her romance ... of 
her first, her real, youth. . . . What was to take its 
place? The future smugly secure on six thousand a 
year and an inviolate social position ... a good dull 
husband . . , not even the prospect of travel. . . .
