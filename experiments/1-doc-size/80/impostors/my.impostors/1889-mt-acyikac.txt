“Yes, they made one.  You could have heard it a mile.”
“Unanimous?”
“That was the nature of it.  After that I put up some signs, for the
protection of future committees, and we have had no intruders since.”
“Clarence, you’ve done a world of work, and done it perfectly.”
“We had plenty of time for it; there wasn’t any occasion for hurry.”
We sat silent awhile, thinking.  Then my mind was made up, and
I said:
“Yes, everything is ready; everything is shipshape, no detail is
wanting.  I know what to do now.”
“So do I; sit down and wait.”
“No,  sir ! rise up and  strike !”
“Do you mean it?”
“Yes, indeed!  The  de fensive isn’t in my line, and the  of fensive
is.  That is, when I hold a fair hand--two-thirds as good a hand
as the enemy.  Oh, yes, we’ll rise up and strike; that’s our game.”
“A hundred to one you are right.  When does the performance begin?”
“ Now!   We’ll proclaim the Republic.”
“Well, that  will  precipitate things, sure enough!”
“It will make them buzz, I tell you!  England will be a hornets’
nest before noon to-morrow, if the Church’s hand hasn’t lost its
cunning--and we know it hasn’t.  Now you write and I’ll dictate thus:
                      “PROCLAMATION
                           ---
   “BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL.  Whereas the king having died
   and left no heir, it becomes my duty to continue the
   executive authority vested in me, until a government
   shall have been created and set in motion.  The
   monarchy has lapsed, it no longer exists.  By
   consequence, all political power has reverted to its
   original source, the people of the nation.  With the
   monarchy, its several adjuncts died also; wherefore
   there is no longer a nobility, no longer a privileged
   class, no longer an Established Church; all men are
   become exactly equal; they are upon one common
   level, and religion is free.   A Republic is hereby
   proclaimed, as being the natural estate of a nation
   when other authority has ceased.  It is the duty of
   the British people to meet together immediately,
   and by their votes elect representatives and deliver
   into their hands the government.”
I signed it “The Boss,” and dated it from Merlin’s Cave.
Clarence said--
“Why, that tells where we are, and invites them to call right away.”
“That is the idea.  We  strike --by the Proclamation--then it’s
their innings.  Now have the thing set up and printed and posted,
right off; that is, give the order; then, if you’ve got a couple
of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill, ho for Merlin’s Cave!”
“I shall be ready in ten minutes.  What a cyclone there is going
to be to-morrow when this piece of paper gets to work!...  It’s a
pleasant old palace, this is; I wonder if we shall ever again
--but never mind about that.”
CHAPTER XLIII
THE BATTLE OF THE SAND BELT
In Merlin’s Cave--Clarence and I and fifty-two fresh, bright,
well-educated, clean-minded young British boys.  At dawn I sent
an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop
operations and remove all life to a safe distance, as everything
was going to be blown up by secret mines, “ and no telling at what
moment--therefore, vacate at once .”  These people knew me, and
had confidence in my word.  They would clear out without waiting
to part their hair, and I could take my own time about dating the
explosion.  You couldn’t hire one of them to go back during the
century, if the explosion was still impending.
We had a week of waiting.  It was not dull for me, because I was
writing all the time.  During the first three days, I finished
turning my old diary into this narrative form; it only required
a chapter or so to bring it down to date.  The rest of the week
I took up in writing letters to my wife.  It was always my habit
to write to Sandy every day, whenever we were separate, and now
I kept up the habit for love of it, and of her, though I couldn’t
do anything with the letters, of course, after I had written them.
But it put in the time, you see, and was almost like talking;
it was almost as if I was saying, “Sandy, if you and Hello-Central
were here in the cave, instead of only your photographs, what
good times we could have!”  And then, you know, I could imagine
the baby goo-gooing something out in reply, with its fists in its
mouth and itself stretched across its mother’s lap on its back,
and she a-laughing and admiring and worshipping, and now and then
tickling under the baby’s chin to set it cackling, and then maybe
