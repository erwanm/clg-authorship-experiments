 He carried himself restlessly even perhaps with a shade of awkwardness,
to which her stillness was a contrast; she just waited, wholly
passive--possibly indeed a trifle portentous. “If you had plotted and
planned it in advance,” he none the less firmly pursued, “if you had
acted from some uncanny or malignant motive, you couldn’t have arranged
more perfectly to incommode, to disconcert and, to all intents and
purposes, make light of me and insult me.” Even before this charge
she made no sign; with her eyes now attached to the ground she let him
proceed. “I had practically guaranteed to our excellent, our charming
friend, your favourable view of his appeal--which you yourself too,
remember, had left him in so little doubt of!--so that, having by your
performance so egregiously failed him, I have the pleasure of their
coming down on me for explanations, for compensations, and for God knows
what besides.”

Lady Grace, looking up at last, left him in no doubt of the rigour of
her attention. “I’m sorry indeed, father, to have done you any wrong;
but may I ask whom, in such a connection, you refer to as ‘they’?”

“‘They’?” he echoed in the manner of a man who has had handed back to
his more careful eye, across the counter, some questionable coin that he
has tried to pass. “Why, your own sister to begin with--whose interest
in what may make for your happiness I suppose you decently recognise;
and his people, one and all, the delightful old Duchess in particular,
who only wanted to be charming to you, and who are as good people, and
as pleasant and as clever, damn it, when all’s said and done, as any
others that are likely to come your way.” It clearly did his lordship
good to work out thus his case, which grew more and more coherent to
him and glowed with irresistible colour. “Letting alone gallant John
himself, most amiable of men, about whose merits and whose claims you
appear to have pretended to agree with me just that you might, when he
presumed, poor chap, ardently to urge them, deal him with the more cruel
effect that calculated blow on the mouth!”

It was clear that in the girl’s great gravity embarrassment had no
share. “They so come down on you I understand then, father, that you’re
obliged to come down on me?”

“Assuredly--for some better satisfaction than your just moping here
without a sign!”

“But a sign of what, father?” she asked--as helpless as a lone islander
scanning the horizon for a sail.

“Of your appreciating, of your in some degree dutifully considering, the
predicament into which you’ve put me!”

“Hasn’t it occurred to you in the least that you’ve rather put me into
one?”

He threw back his head as from exasperated nerves. “I put you certainly
in the predicament of your receiving by my care a handsome settlement
in life--which all the elements that would make for your enjoying it
had every appearance of successfully commending to you.” The perfect
readiness of which on his lips had, like a higher wave, the virtue
of lifting and dropping him to still more tangible ground. “And if I
understand you aright as wishing to know whether I apologise for that
zeal, why you take a most preposterous view of our relation as father
and daughter.”

“You understand me no better than I fear I understand you,” Lady Grace
returned, “if what you expect of me is really to take back my words to
Lord John.” And then as he didn’t answer, while their breach gaped like
a jostled wound, “Have you seriously come to propose--and from him
again,” she added--“that I shall reconsider my resolute act and lend
myself to your beautiful arrangement?”

It had so the sound of unmixed ridicule that he could only, for his
dignity, not give way to passion. “I’ve come, above all, for this, I
may say, Grace: to remind you of whom you’re addressing when you jibe at
me, and to make of you assuredly a plain demand--exactly as to whether
you judged us to have actively incurred your treatment of our unhappy
friend, to have brought it upon us, he and I, by my refusal to discuss
with you at such a crisis the question of my disposition of a particular
item of my property. I’ve only to look at you, for that matter,” Lord
Theign continued--always with a finer point and a higher consistency as
his rehearsal of his wrongs broadened--“to have my inquiry, as it seems
to me, eloquently answered. You flounced away from poor John, you took,
as he tells me, ‘his head off,’ just to repay me for what you chose to
regard as my snub on the score of your challenging my entertainment of
