where on the south coast (a phrase of 
which she liked the sound) they should put 
in their allowance together ; but she already 
felt the prospect quite weary and worn with 
the way he went round and round on it. It 
had become his sole topic, the theme alike 
of his most solemn prudences and most 
placid jests, to which every opening led for 
return and revision and in which every little 
flower of a foretaste was pulled up as soon as 
planted. He had announced at the earliest 
day characterizing the whole business, from 
that moment, as their plans, under which 
name he handled it as a syndicate handles a 
Chinese, or other, Loan he had promptly 
declared that the question must be thor 
oughly studied, and he produced, on the 
whole subject, from day to day, an amount 
of information that excited her wonder and 
even, not a little, as she frankly let him 
know, her disdain. When she thought of 
the danger in which another pair of lovers 
rapturously lived, she inquired of him anew 
why he could leave nothing to chance. 





Then she got for answer that this profundity 
was just his pride, and he pitted Ramsgate 
against Bournemouth and even Boulogne 
against Jersey for he had great ideas with 
all the mastery of detail that was some day, 
professionally, to carry him far. 

The longer the time since she had seen 
Captain Everard, the more she was booked, 
as she called it, to pass Park Chambers ; and 
this was the sole amusement that, in the 
lingering August days and the long, sad 
twilights, it was left her to cultivate. She 
had long since learned to know it for a 
feeble one, though its feebleness was per 
haps scarce the reason for her saying to 
herself each evening as her time for de 
parture approached: No, no not to-night. 
She never failed of that silent remark, any 
more than she failed of feeling, in some 
deeper place than she had even yet fully 
sounded, that one 's remarks were as weak as 
straws and that, however one might indulge 
in them at eight o clock, one 's fate infallibly 
declared itself in absolute indifference to 





them at about eight-fifteen. Remarks were 
remarks, and very well for that; but fate 
was fate, and this young lady 's was to pass 
Park Chambers every night in the working 
week. Out of the immensity of her knowl 
edge of the life of the world there bloomed 
on these occasions a specific remembrance 
that it was regarded in that region, in 
August and September, as rather pleasant 
just to be caught for something or other in 
passing through town. Somebody was 
always passing and somebody might catch 
somebody else. It was in full cognisance of 
this subtle law that she adhered to the most 
ridiculous circuit she could have made to get 
home. One warm, dull, featureless Friday, 
when an accident had made her start from 
Cocker 's a little later than usual, she became 
aware that something of which the infinite
