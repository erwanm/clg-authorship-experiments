Everything was now in readiness for the sinking 
of the hogshead, and both of the boys were in- 
tensely excited to learn the success of the exper- 
iment. They had been very careful in adjusting all 
the ropes and other apparatus, and their calculations 



 

had been so accurately made, that little had been 
left to chance. The cask lay on the skids with the 
sinker. The long rope fastened to the weight, and 
"toggled" to the hogshead, was passed through the 
block on the derrick, and wound around the wind- 
lass. 

" Now, give us a turn at the windlass, Ethan," 
said Lawry, when he was ready. 

" Ay, ay," replied Ethan, as he turned the crank, 
and raised the sinker and the cask, so that the 
skids which supported them could be removed. 

" Lower away ! " added Lawry, highly excited ; and 
the sinker began to descend into the water, carry- 
ing with it the hogshead. " That works first rate. 
Now hold on till I get hold of the other end of 
the guide-rope." 

Lawry jumped into the wherry, and sculled round 
to the other side of the sunken steamer, where he 
detached the end of the line passing under the keel 
from the smoke-stack, where it had been secured. 
He hauled on the rope till he got it clear of the 
stone with which it had been sunk. 

" Lower away ! " shouted Lawry. 








" Lower, it is," answered Ethan. 
"Slowly," added the pilot, as he hauled in the 
rope. 

"It is going to the right place. I can see it in 
tho water." 

" Hold on ! " cried Lawry ; and the wherry was 
so unsteady beneath him, that it was with great 
difficulty he " kept what he had got " on the rope. 

In order to overcome this disadvantage he passed 
the rope around the smoke-stack. 

" I have it now ! " shouted he. " This gives me 
a splendid purchase ; " and he hauled in the rope, 
bringing the hogshead chock up to the hull of the 
sunken craft. 

" We are growing wiser every moment," laughed 
Ethan. 

" So we are. Lower away, slowly. That's it,"' 
said Lawry. " Lower away." 

" The sinker is on the bottom," replied Ethan, 
as he let go the crank of the windlass. 

"All right; can you see the hogshead?" 

" Yes ; you have hauled it completely under the 
guard. The water is as clear as crystal," answered 
Ethan.
