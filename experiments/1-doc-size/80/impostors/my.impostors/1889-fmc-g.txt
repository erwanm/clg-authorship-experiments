and sad regret, in this real letter was written the secret whose 
effects had so nearly ruined his life, a secret so terrible, that had 
Hilda guessed it she would have thrust the cruel message from the 
dead into the flames, rather than allow it to live and stab Greif to 
the heart. 

Hilda did not understand his hesitation, though she knew as 
well as he himself that the yet unread words contained the solution 
of the great problem. But she sat patiently by his side, her white 
hand resting on his shoulder, her anxious face turned towards his, 
her lips already parted, as though but awaiting her breath to speak 
words of consolation for the suffering that had not yet begun. 

Greif roused himself, as though ashamed of the emotion he had 
shown, though indeed he had seemed outwardly calm enough. He 
pressed his lips together and ran his finger through the upper side 
of the envelope, so as not to break the seal. His hands did not 
tremble any longer, and with the action all his dreams vanished in 
the broad light of the summer morning. Carefully he withdrew the 
sheet and spread it out. 

' Shall I go, sweetheart ? Would you rather be alone ? ' Hilda 
asked once more. 

'No, darling. Read it with me let us read it together,' he 
answered quietly, as though he were speaking in some sacred 
presence". 

Hilda bent her golden head forward until it was close to his, 
and their cheeks touched as they read together the contents. 

' My dear Greif, my beloved son first of all, I remind you that 
you are a man and a brave one, and I solemnly enjoin upon you to 





act like one, and to put your trust in God. A great misfortune 
has befallen you, and at the moment of death I look to you to bear 
its burden in a manner worthy of a German gentleman. Heaven 
will certainly atone to you for the injustice of a cruel destiny. 
Your mother was the lawful wife of my brother Rieseneck. She 
has deceived me for five and twenty years, until his sudden coming 
revealed to me all her crimes within an hour. You are therefore 
illegitimate and nameless, and not one penny of my fortune is yours. 
I am utterly dishonoured by this enormous wickedness. My 
brother and I have done justice upon the woman Clara Kurtz, 
Freiherrin von Rieseneck, after receiving her full confession, and 
nothing remains for us but to die decently. As for you, I need 
not point out your course. You will declare the truth to my cousin 
Therese von Sigmundskron, who is the sole heir to all my fortune 
and estates, being next of kin in the line of the Greifensteins. You 
will renounce your engagement to marry Hilda von Sigmundskron. 
You will enter the ranks and serve your king as a private soldier, 
which is the only course open to a penniless gentleman. I know 
you too well to think you will hesitate a moment. My brother 
leaves a son by his wife, who goes by the name of Rex, and to whom 
he is now writing. Perhaps it is the student of whom you have 
spoken often to me lately. He is your brother as Rieseneck is mine, 
and he is rich by his father's death. But you will accept nothing 
from him, nor from any one else except your sovereign, who, if 
he learns your story, may help you if he be graciously pleased to 
do so. 

' My son, I am about to die. I have taken the law into my 
own hands and I must pay the penalty by the only hand to which 
I can submit. If I have been at fault towards you, if I have been 
deceived by this woman through any carelessness of mine, I, your 
father, implore your forgiveness at this final moment. And so I 
leave you. May the God of our fathers protect and bless you, and 
bring you to a nobler end than mine. Though you are nameless 
and penniless, you can yet be a Christian man ; you can be true, 
you can be brave, and you can give your life, which is all you have 
to give, to your king and your country. Farewell. Your father, 

 

Strange as it may seem, both Hilda and Greif read this long 
letter to the end before they paused, almost before they under-
