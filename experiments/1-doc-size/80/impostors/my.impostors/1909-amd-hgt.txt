One and another was relating grievances 
and defacements. 

“ Though it’s not as bad as real paint. 
There was a grotesque figure on my nice 
newly-painted front door — with horns and a 
tail, and even if it was too new to touch I had 
it scrubbed off,” complained a neighbor. 
“ Now it will have to be done over. Mr. Kent 

has been driving the boys out of the apple 



orchard, — we have a few very fine trees and 
we count on what they bring in to us. It is a 
shame to have your property destroyed and 
your crops ruined or stolen.’ 

“ Some stringent measures must be taken to 
stop these depredations,” said Mr. Hildreth. 

“ I don’t know that I am altogether in favor 
of the high school,” continued the indignant 
Mrs. Kent. “ We have had some rest from 
mischief these two years, while the large boys 
have been away, and now it has begun again.” 
“ What about the high school? ” asked Mr. 
Underwood, who had just entered with his 
wife. “ That is the apple of Mr. Hildreth’s 
eye, the idol of his heart,” and he laughed over 
to him. “ Mrs. Stirling, I hope you are not 
suffering from the shock too severely. Noth- 
ing can exceed my regret that you should have 
been made the victim of such a cruel trick.” 

“ I had rather have the high school closed 
than turn out such miscreants,” Mr. Hildreth 
exclaimed indignantly. 

“ But why the high school ? There are boys 
down in the paper mill, in the cloth mill as 
well. Some of them frequent the saloons, 




and many of these mischiefs seem like half- 
drunken capers. I can’t have our boys blamed 
for everything.” 

“ But you see we had comparative peace 
last fall, and the mill boys were there. Most 
of them have been in the public school. You 
should have trained them better, Mr. Under- 
wood.” 

That gentleman flushed with a spasm of 
anger, as he replied: 

“ You seem to forget that boys will be boys 
and that for a few years they are the very 
embodiment of mischief. But they turn out 
very fair men afterward.” 

“Well, I’m thankful I never had a boy!” 
declared Mrs. Kent. 

“ If all the mothers felt that way what would 
we do for husbands,” laughed Mrs. Under- 
wood. 

“ Why, I thought matters were going on 
very nicely with us. Miss Grant has noticed 
the improvement. It isn’t fair to put all the 
blame on us. Miss Grant, take up the cudgels 
for us,” and Mr. Underwood gave her a mean- 
ing look.
