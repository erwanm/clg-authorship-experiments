" They all have the same look, a good deal," said 
the girl, glancing over the room where the waitresses 
stood ranged against the wall with their hands folded 
at their waists. " They have better faces than figures, 
but she is beautiful every way. Do you suppose they 
are all school-teachers ? They look intellectual. Or 
is it their glasses ? " 

" I don't know," said the mother. " They used to 
be ; but things change here so rapidly, it may all be 
different. Do you like it ? " 

" I think it's charming here," said the younger lady, 
evasively. " Everything is so exquisitely clean. And

the food is very good. Is this corn-bread — that you've 
told me about so much ? " 

" Yes, this is corn-bread. You will have to get ac- 
customed to it." 

" Perhaps it won't take long. I could fancy that 
girl knowing about everything. Don't you like her 
looks?" 

" Oh, very much ! " Mrs. Vostrand turned for an- 
other glance at Cynthia. 

" What say ? " Their smiling waitress came for- 
ward from the wall where she was leaning, as if she 
thought they had spoken to her. 

" Oh, we were speaking — the young lady to whom 
Mr. Durgin was talking — she is — " 

" She's the housekeeper — Miss Whitwell." 

" Oh, indeed ! She seems so young — " 

" I guess she knows what to do-o-o," the waitress 
chanted. " We think she's about ri-i-ght ! " She 
smiled tolerantly upon the misgiving of the stranger, 
if it was that, and then retreated when the mother and 
daughter began talking together again. 

They had praised the mountain with the cloud ofE, 
to Jeff, very politely, and now the mother said, a little 
more intimately, but still with the deference of a so- 
ciety acquaintance, " He seems very gentlemanly, and 
I am sure he is very kind. I don't quite know what 
to do about it, do you ? " 

" No, I don't. It's all strange to me, you know." 

" Yes, I suppose it must be. But you will get used 
to it if we remain in the country. Do you think you 
will dislike it ? " 



 

" Oh, no ! It's very difierent. " 

"Yes, it's different. He is very handsome, in a 
certain way.'' The daughter said nothing, and the 
mother added, " I wonder if he was trying to conceal 
that he had come second-cabin, and was not going to 
let us know that he crossed with us ? " 

"Do you think he was bound to do so? " 

" No. But it was very odd, his not mentioning it. 
And his going out on a cattle-steamer," the mother 
observed.
