but that was not entirely; now and then interest made her
forget herself, and quitting her needle she would give eyes
and attention to the principal speaker as frankly as he could
have desired. Bad weather and bad roads for those days put
riding out of the question.

One morning she was called down to see a gentleman, and came
eschewing in advance the expected image of Mr. Thorn. It was a
very different person.

"Charlton Rossitur! My dear Charlton, how do you do? Where did
you come from?"

"You had better ask me what I have come for," he said,
laughing, as he shook hands with her.

"What have you come for?"

"To carry you home."

"Home?" said Fleda.

"I am going up there for a day or two, and mamma wrote me I
had better act as your escort, which, of course, I am most
willing to do. See what mamma says to you."

"When are you going, Charlton?" said Fleda, as she broke the
seal of the note he gave her.

"To-morrow morning."

"That is too sudden a notice, Captain Rossitur," said Mrs.
Evelyn. "Fleda will hurry herself out of her colour, and then
your mother will say there is something in sea-breezes that
isn't good for her; and then she will never trust her within
reach of them again  which I am sure Miss Ringgan would be
sorry for."

Fleda took her note to the window, half angry with herself
that a kind of banter, in which certainly there was very
little wit, should have power enough to disturb her. But
though the shaft might be a slight one, it was winged with a
will; the intensity of Mrs. Evelyn's enjoyment in her own
mischief gave it all the force that was wanting. Fleda's head
was in confusion; she read her aunt's note three times over
before she had made up her mind on any point respecting it.


"MY DEAREST FLEDA,

"Charlton is coming home for a day or two  hadn't you better
take the opportunity to return with him? I feel as if you had
been long away, my dear child  don't you feel so too? Your
uncle is very desirous of seeing you; and as for Hugh and me,
we are but half ourselves. I would not still say a word about
your coming home if it were for your good to stay; but I fancy
from something in Mrs. Evelyn's letter, that Queechy air will
by this time do you good again; and opportunities of making
the journey are very uncertain. My heart has grown lighter
since I gave it leave to expect you.  Yours, my darling,


R.


"P. S.  I will write to Mrs. E. soon."


"What string has pulled these wires that are twitching me
home?" thought Fleda, as her eyes went over and over the words
which the feeling of the lines of her face would alone have
told her were unwelcome. And why unwelcome?  "One likes to be
moved by fair means and not by foul," was the immediate
answer. "And, besides, it is very disagreeable to be taken by
surprise. Whenever in any matter of my staying or going, did
aunt Lucy have any wish but my pleasure?" Fleda mused a little
while; and then, with a perfect understanding of the machinery
that had been at work, though an extremely vague and repulsed
notion of the spring that had moved it, she came quietly out
from her window and told Charlton she would go with him.
