an end to all her earthly trials at once. Tom, therefore, in 
his well-brushed broadcloth suit, smooth beaver, glossy boots, 
faultless wristbands and collar, with his grave, good-natured 
black face, looked respectable enough to be a bishop of 
Carthage, as men of his colour were in other ages. 





Then, too, lie was in a beautiful place, a consideration to 
which his sensitive race are never indifferent ; and he did 
enjoy with a quiet joy the birds, the flowers, the fountains, 
the perfume, and light and beauty of the court, the silken 
hangings, and pictures, and lustres, and statuettes, and 
gilding, that made the parlours within a kind of Aladdin's 
palace to him. 

If ever Africa shall show an elevated and cultivated race 
and come it must, some time, her turn to figure in the 
great drama of human improvement life will awake there 
with a gorgeousness and splendour of which our cold western 
tribes faintly have conceived. In that far-off mystic land of 
gold, and gems, and spices, and waving palms, and wondrous 
flowers, and miraculous fertility, will awake new forms of 
art, new styles of splendour ; and the negro race, no longer 

despised and

of the latest and most magnificent revelations of human life. 
Certainry they will, in their gentleness, their lowly docility 
of heart, their aptitude to repose on a superior mind and rest 
on a higher power, their childlike simplicity of affection, and 
facility of forgiveness. In all these they will exhibit the 
highest form of the peculiarly Christian life, and, perhaps, 
as Grod chasteneth whom he loveth, he hath chosen poor 
Africa in the furnace of affliction, to make her the highest 
and noblest in that kingdom which he will set up when 
every other kingdom has been tried and failed ; for the first 
shall be last, and the last first. 

Was this what Marie St. Clare was thinking of, as she 
stood, gorgeously dressed, on the verandah, on Sunday 
morning, clasping a diamond bracelet on her slender wrist ? 
Most likely it was. Or, if it wasn't that, it was something 
else ; for Marie patronised good things, and she was going 
now, in full force diamonds, silk, and lace, and jewels and 
all to a fashionable church, to be very religious. Marie 
always made a point to be very pious on Sundays. There 
she stood, so slender, so elegant, so airy and undulating in 
all her motions, her lace scarf enveloping her like a mist. 
She looked a graceful creature, and she felt very good and 
very elegant indeed. Miss Ophelia stood at her side, a 
perfect contrast. It was not that she had not as handsome 
a silk dress and shawl, and as fine a pocket-handkerchief; 







but stiffness and squareness, and bolt-uprightness, enveloped 
her with as indefinite yet appreciable a presence as did grace 
her elegant neighbour ; not the grace of God, however that 
is quite another thing. 

" Where's Eva?" said Marie. 

" The child stopped on the stairs, to say something to 
Mammy." 

And what was Eva saying to Mammy on the stairs ? 
Listen, reader, and you will hear, though Marie does not. 

"Dear Mammy, I know your head is aching dreadfully." 

" Lord bless you, Miss Eva, my head allers aches lately ! 
You don't need to worry."
