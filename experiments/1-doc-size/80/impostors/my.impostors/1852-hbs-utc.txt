He says that though I don't say anything, he sees I've got 
the devil in me, and he means to bring it out ; and one of 
these days it will come out in a way that he won't like, or 
I'm mistaken." 

" Oh, dear, what shall we do ? " said Eliza, mournfully. 

" It was only yesterday," said George, " as I was busy 
loading stones into a cart, that young Mas'r Tom stood 
there, slashing his whip so near the horse, that the creature 
was frightened. I asked him to stop as pleasant as I 
could ; he just kept right on. I begged him again, and 
then he turned on me, and began striking me. I held his 
hand, and then he screamed, and kicked, and ran to his 
father, and told him that I was fighting him. He came in a 
rage, and said he'd teach me who was my master ; and he 
tied me to a tree, and cut switches for young master, and 
told him that he might whip me till he was tired ; and he 
did do it. If I don't make him remember it some time ! " 

And the brow of the young man grew dark, and his eyes 
burned with an expression that made his young wife tremble. 







" Who made this man my master that's what I want to 
know?" he said. 

" "Well," said Eliza, mournfully, " I always thought that 
I must obey my master and mistress, or I couldn't be a 
Christian!" 

"There is some sense in it, in your case; they have 
brought you up like a child fed you, clothed you, indulged 
you, and taught you, so that you have a good education, 
that is some reason why they should claim you. But I have 
been kicked, and cuffed, and sworn at, and at the best only 
let alone ; and what do I owe ? I've paid for all my keeping 
a hundred times over. I won't bear it no, I won't I " he 
said, clenching his hand with a fierce frown. 

Eliza trembled and was silent. She had never seen her 
husband in this mood before ; and her gentle system of 
ethics seemed to bend like a reed in the surges of such 
passions. 

" You know poor little Carlo that you gave me ? " added 
George ; " the creature has been about all the comfort that 
I've had. He has slept with me nights, and followed me 
around days, and kind o' looked at me as if he understood 
how I felt. Well, the other day I was just feeding him with 
with a few old scraps I picked up by the kitchen-door, and 
Mas'r came along, and said I was feeding him up at his 
expense, and that he couldn't afford to have every nigger 
keeping his dog, and ordered me to tie a stone to his neck, 
and throw him in the pond." 

" Oh, George, you didn't do it! " 

" Do it ! not I ; but he did. Mas'r and Tom pelted the 
poor drowning creature with stones. Poor thing ! he looked 
at me so mournful, as if he wondered why I didn't save him. 
I had to take a flogging because I wouldn't do it myself. I 
don't care ; Mas'r will find out that I am one that whipping 
won't tame. My day will come yet, if he don't look out." 

" What are you going to do ? Oh, G-eorge, don't do 
anything wicked ; if you only trust in God, and try to do 
right, he'll deliver you." 

" I an't a Christian like you, Eliza ; my heart's full of 
bitterness ; I can't trust in God. Why does He let things 
be so ? " 

" Oh, George, we must have faith ! Mistress says that
