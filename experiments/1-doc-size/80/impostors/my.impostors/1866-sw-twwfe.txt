necessary harvests of grain and fruit. The whole earth was 
of one language and one speech. They were all one great 
family, and naturally kept together; only growing and 
spreading along over the face of the country, as they multiplied from a few into a great many. We can tell pretty 
nearly, I think, what course some of them took. Let us look 
at the map. Up here, you see, is the valley of the Arazes 



and Nak-scMvan. It is written, ' they journeyed from 
the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar.' Now, if 
they had come down from Armenia over these southern hills, 
they would have found a plain a great deal sooner — up here 
in the northern parts of Mesopotamia. But if they came 
from the valley of the Araxes, they would travel down along 
the eastern side of this range of Koordish mountains, with- 
out finding a good place to cross them, till they came almost 
as low down as Babylon. That is the course the caravans 
from Tebreez take at this day. If they crossed the mountains higher up, they would have a very difficult road to 
travel; but they follow down along the level ground on 
the east side until they come to Kermanshah — then they 
turn short about, and pass through the mountains to go to 
Bagdad." 

" But, uncle Sam," said Eliphalet, " how do you know — 
how can you be sure, I mean — where the land of Shinar 
was." 

"Just by consulting the records," said uncle Sam. " It is 
written in the tenth chapter of Genesis — open your Bibles 
and see — that the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom was 
'Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of 
Shinar.' Now the site of Babel has never been questioned ; 
and ' Erech,' I suppose, is the same with the modern name 
Wxrka, or Iraky lower down on the river. Yes, this is 
Shinar, — the land where, so far as we know, the first effort 
was made to build up a nation proud and great without the 
greatness that God gives. Between those two rivers the 
experiment was tried afterwards over and over again ; and 
the Lord has every time crushed the effort to dust. No 
greatness can stand that tries to be independent of Him." 

" Uncle Sam, where does it tell about that ?" 

" See, Tiny, here. ' They said. Go to, let us build us a 
city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let 
us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the 
face of the whole earth.' Nimrod was a powerful, ambitious 
man ; he knew that to make a great kingdom he must have 
something to bind the people together ; they must have 



 

common centre; some grand rallying-point of strength, 
security, and splendour. And that land had no natural fortresses or barriers to shut the people in. He must make 
what he wanted," 

" And was the Tower of Babel what he wanted ? " 

"It would have been." 

"Uncle Sam, is anything of the Tower of Babel there 
yetr 

"Hardly, Dan. The foundation may be there, covered 
up under some of Nebuchadnezzar's building ; but no more. 
There are remains, though, of towers or temples nearly as 
old— at Warka, or Irak, and at Mugheir ; temples or towers 
built for the worship of the god Bel ; and built almost as 
far back as the time of Nimrod's great tower." 

" Oh, uncle Sam, have you seen them yourself ?"

" And the plain of Shinar ? " added Priscilla. 

" I couldn't very well get to them without going over the 
plain," said uncle Sam. " Come, let us begin regularly, and 
look at my map, and see where we are. Here, you see, is the
