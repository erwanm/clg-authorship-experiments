Roman port and harbor for fleets of war and merchan- 
dise. There Theodoric, the reat king of the Goths, 
set up his palace, and there is his enormous mausoleum. 
As early as A.D. 44 it became an episcopal see, with 
St. Apollinaris, a disciple of St. Peter, for its bishop. 
There some of the later Roman emperors fixed their 
residences, and there they repose. In and about it 
revolved the adventurous Ufe of Galla Placidia, a wo- 
  

man of considerable talent and no principle, the daugh- 
ter of Theodosius (the great Theodosius, who subdued 
the Arian heresy, the first emperor baptized in the 
true faith of the Trinity, the last who had a spark of 
genius), the sister of one emperor, and the mother 
of another, — twice a slave, once a queen, and once an 
empress; and she, too, rests there in the great mau- 
soleum builded for lier. There, also, lies Dante, in his 
tomb " by the upbraiding shore ; " rejected once of un- 
grateful Florence, and forever after passionately longed 
for. There, in one of the earliest Christian churches in 
existence, are the fine mosaics of the Emperor Justinian, 
and Theodora, the handsome courtesan whom he raised 
to the dignity and luxury of an empress on his throne in 
Constantinople. There is the famous forest of pines, 
stretching unbroken twenty miles down the coast to 
Rimini, in whose cool and breezy glades Dante and 
Boccaccio walked and meditated, which Dryden has 
commemorated, and Byron has invested with the fas 
cination of his genius ; and under the whispering boughs 
of which moved the glittering cavalcade which fetched 
the bride to Kimini, — the fair Francesca, whose sinful 
confession Dante heard in hell. 

We went down to Ravenna from Bologna one after- 
noon, through a country level and rich, riding along 
toward hazy evening, the land getting flatter as we pro- 
ceeded (you know, there is a difierence between level 
and flat), through interminable mulberry-trees and vines, 
and fields with the tender green of spring, with church- 
spires in the rosy horizon ; on till the meadows became 
marshes, in which millions of frogs sang the overture of 
the opening year. Our arrival, I have reason to believe, 
was an event in the old town. We had a crowd of 
mouldy loafers to witness it at the station, not one of 
whom had ambition enough to work to earn a sou by 
lilting our travelling-bags. We had our hotel to our- 
selves, and wished that anybody else had it. The rival 
house was quite aware of our advent, and watched us with 


 

jealous eyes ; and we, in turn, looked wistfully at it, for 
our own food was so scarce that, as an old traveller says, 
we feared tliat we shouldn't have enough, until we saw 
it on the table, when its quality made it appear too much. 
The next morning, when I sallied out to hire a convey- 
ance, I was an object of interest to the entire population, 
who seemed to think it very odd that any one should 
walk about and explore the quiet streets. If I were to 
describe Ravenna, I should say that it is as flat as Hol- 
land and as lively as New London. There are broad 
streets, with high houses, that once were handsome, 
palaces that were once the abode of luxury, gardens 
that still bloom, and churches by the score. It is an 
open gate through which one walks unchallenged into 
the past, with little to break the association with the early 
Christian ages, their monuments undimmed by time, un- 
touched by restoration and innovation, the whole struck 
with ecclesiastical death. With all that we saw that 
day, — churches, basilicas, mosaics, statues, mausoleums, 
— I will not burden these pages ; but I will set down 
enough to give you the local color, and to recall some 
of the most interesting passages in Christian history in 
this out-of-the-way city on the Adriatic. 

Our first pilgrimage was to the Church of St. Apol- 
linare Nuova ; but why it is called new I do not know, 
as Theodoric built it, for an Arian cathedral in about
