'' Do not let her quite hate me," pleads Doris. 

" I think she will love you. Dr. Prescott believes that 
you and the baby will be the means of rousing her to a 
true life. In many ways she is still a child. Mrs. Stir- 
ling seems much older." 

'' Will they take her away?" Doris asks. 

" Not yet. The doctor must decide when it will be safe 
for her to go. I have not offended you?" Mrs. Fair 
asks. 

" Oh, no, no ! I did not like to deceive her at first." 

" You are sweet enough to be Saint Angela." 

Doris raises her face to kiss Mrs. Fair. Tender as she 
is, she is choice of her caresses, but this woman has been 
so motherly kind. 

That evening Doris sits alone and reads, — the old 
poems Lloyd loved so well. How can she spend all the 
years in this great house alone ? She feels doubly desolate 
to-night, as if she had been again bereaved. The old 
prayer comes back, — " Give us patience under our afflictions." 
She can do nothing but endure. She cannot 
hurry anything. All her strength is helplessness. Yet it 
seems as if in some other place she might lead a useful, 
helpful, pleasant life. 

The next morning Mrs. Ashmead makes her appear- 
ance, escorted by Judge Minturn. She is quite tall, with 
a delicate, high-bred air that reminds Doris of Miss Van 
Antwerp. Iler voice shows cultivation, and her pronun- 
ciation has the least touch of formality, but it is very 
pleasant. She is past forty, and though there is little of 
youth about her, still less are there any signs of age, 
except in the serene grace that enfolds her as if she were 
thoroughly accustomed to it. There is a dignity that at 
first somewhat overawes Doris. Her face is refined rather 
than handsome, and Doris thinks the old term "gentle- 
woman " suits her exactly. , 

»She has listened to the judge's proposal, and admits 
that he has interested her very much in Mrs. Wentworth. 
They will spend a month together, and then consider a 
future engagement. 

Doris is quite satisfied. She has arranged the room 
adjoining hers, and shows Mrs. Ashmead to it ; then takes 
her through her own, and a spare chamber that the Gil- 
berts occupied. Certainly Mrs. Ashmead will be a little 
protection against them, and yet she blushes at the 
thought. The baby has gone out for his morning airing. 
They wander through the library and the large dining- 
room ; from thence to the cosey sitting-room with its bright 
bay-window. Then they take a turn or two on the long 
porch blazing in the scarlet of a creeper and dusky with 
the downy seed-lobes of clematis. It is a delicious Indian- 
summer day, and there is the sort of dry fragrance in the 
air, the richness of all ripened tints. A long line of 
late dahlias turn their brilliant faces to the sun. 

How much Doris misses the liberty of running in to see 
Olive no words can describe. Now and then a feeling of
