"Don't you, Mr. Murray?" said the young lady. 

"Let us hear your reasons, please." 

"Well, Mr. Murray, surely life is given to us for 
something besides bare work. We are meant to 
be happy and enjoy ourselves a little aren't we?" 

"Most certainly." 



 

"Those good men, I dare say they were good 
men, seem to me to have been mistaken." 

"You think, for instance, they might have kept 
some of their New Year's money to buy their wives 
new dresses ? " 

"Yes; or to get a good dinner, which I suppose 
they never had ; or a carpet, suppose, for the bit of 
a room they lived in." 

"What do you say, Esther? " 

" I think just as Flora does, Uncle Eden. I 
think those people were very extravagant." 

"Maggie?" 

"Uncle Eden, I do not know if they were extrav 
agant; but it seems to me they might have kept a 
little for their own New Year." 

"You all overlook one thing." 

"What is that, sir?" several voices asked eagerly. 

" Those good men were not acting so very contrary to your principle. They were doing, every 
one of them, what gave him the most pleasure with 
his money. That is what I understand you to advocate. The only difference is, that they found 
their pleasure in one thing, and you would find 
yours in another." 

" But, Mr. Murray, " Meredith began. 

" Yes, Mr. Murray," said Flora eagerly taking the 
words out of her brother's mouth, " you have really 
not said anything. The question comes round, 
ought we to find our pleasure in what they did? 
and in nothing else ? " 

" That is not the right way of putting it. The 



 

Lord does not demand that, nor desire it; but that 
we should seek first the kingdom of God. You 
may remember too that the spirit of our life, if we 
are Christians, must be the same as Christ's; for 
'if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is 
none of his.' Now the motto of his life was, ' My 
meat is to do the will of him that sent me.' And 
that, Miss Flora, must make pleasing God the great 
pleasure of a child of God." 

"That is what I think," said Meredith. 

" Then are we to have no pleasure ? " Flora repeated. " I mean, no pleasure of our own." 

" I have been trying to explain that. I do not 
know any pleasure much sweeter than pleasing 
some one that we dearly love ; do you ? " 

Flora looked very gloomy.
