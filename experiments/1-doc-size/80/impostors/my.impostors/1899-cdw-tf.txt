the press and the fashionable world, Mrs. Mavick 
had endeavored to surround her intended son-in- 
law with the toils of domestic peace. 

He must be made to feel at home. And this 
she did. Mrs. Mavick was as admirable in the 
role of a domestic woman as of a woman of the 
world. The simple pleasures, the confidences, 
the intimacies of home life surrounded him. His 
own mother, the aged duchess, could not have 
looked upon him with more affection, and possi- 
bly not have pampered him with so many luxu- 




 

ries. There was only one thing wanting to make 
this home complete. In conventional Europe 
the contracting parties are not the signers of the 
marriage contract. In the United States the par- 
ties most interested take the initiative in making: 
the contract. 

Here lay the difficulty of the situation, a situa- 
tion that puzzled Lord Montague and enraged 
Mrs. Mavick. Evelyn maintained as much in- 
difference to the domestic as to the worldly sit- 
uation. Her mother thought her lifeless and 
insensible ; she even went so far as to call her un- 
womanly in her indifference to what any other 
woman would regard as an opportunity for a 
brilliant career. 

Lifeless indeed she was, poor child; physically 
languid and scarcely able to drag herself through 
the daily demands upon her strength. Her 
mother made it a reproach that she was so pale 
and unresponsive. Apparently she did not resist, 
she did everything she was told to do. She 
passed, indeed, hours with Lord Montague, occa- 
sions contrived when she was left alone in the 
house with him, and she made heroic efforts to 
be interested, to find something in his mind that 
was in sympathy with her own thoughts. With 
a woman's ready instinct she avoided commit- 
ting herself to his renewed proposals, sometimes 
covert, sometimes direct, but the struggle tired 




 

her. At the end of all such interviews she had 
to meet her mother, who, with a smile of hope 
and encouragement, always said, "Well, I sup- 
pose you and Lord Montague have made it up," 
and then to encounter the contempt expressed 
for her as a " goose." 

She was helpless in such toils. At times she 
felt actually abandoned of any human aid, and 
in moods of despondency almost resolved to give 
up the struggle. In the eyes of the world it was 
a good match, it would make her mother happy, 
no doubt her father also ; and was it not her duty 
to put aside her repugnance, and go with the 
current of the social and family forces that seeijied 
irresistible ? 

Few people can resist doing what is universal- 
ly expected of them. This invisible pressure is 
more difficult to stand against than individual 
tyranny. There are no tragedies in our modern 
life so pathetic as the ossification of women's 
hearts when love is crushed under the compul- 
sion of social and caste requirements. Every- 
body expected that Evelyn would accept Lord
