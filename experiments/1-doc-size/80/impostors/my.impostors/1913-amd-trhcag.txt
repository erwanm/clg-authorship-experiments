my wedding-clothes. If I couldn’t afford ’em I 
wouldn’t get married, that’s all !” 

The sleigh skimmed along merrily. They 
were too young to suspect the heart-burnings they 
had left behind. 

“ I hope it will snow pretty soon again,” said 
Dan. Now that we have begun, we may as well 
go on.” 

“ It’s the most splendid thing in the world ! ” 
declared Goldie enthusiastically. “ And the bells 
are the danciest of music.” 

They don’t seem to keep Sunday very strictly,” 
said Chan. 

But Sunday ought to be a happy sort of day. 
Does it help you to look solemn and feel cross ? ” 

“ Why, no. And you don’t have to work much, 



so you can stop and think of beautiful things. 
And weren’t the carols lovely! I know some of 
the tunes.” 

“ Fve brought my paper home. There were 
only two given to our class, and they said I should 
have one for keeps. I thought it real good of 
them.” 

Dan smiled now and then, but it was not at their 
chatter. He had taken the horses to Mr. Beers’s, 
where there was a partly inclosed shed. After 
blanketing them, he accepted the pressing invita- 
tion to walk in. Mrs. Beers was reading the 
Bible, her Sunday afternoon occupation after she 
had taken her nap. She was a thrifty, industrious

When them twins was born everybody thought it 
dreadful. And then on the top of it their father 
died. Bessy Firth got along somehow; I never

Linn’s as nice and smart a boy as you’d find 
in a day’s walk,” said Mr. Beers. He’s a good 
head for business, and I think his mother had 
better kept him at it. Eight children’s a mighty 
big lot to saddle on a man all to wunst. I don’t 
see how your Mr. Mann could think of under- 
taking it.” 

If she, Mrs. Firth, as she was then, could do 
it, I don’t see why a man with plenty of money 
couldn’t,” Dan responded with a short laugh. 

Last summer he was going round to orphan 
asylums hunting up some. He’s awful fond of 
children.” 

Folks thought the Gedneys had plenty of 
money, and they came out at the little end of the 
horn. Of course, Linn and Rilla’ll soon be big 
enough to help along if they have the right bring-
