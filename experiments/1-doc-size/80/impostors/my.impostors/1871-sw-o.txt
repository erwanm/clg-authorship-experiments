said Mrs. Eldridge wiping her lips. 

" You see you were mistaken. Here are 
two people that care for you." 



" She cares the most," said Mrs. Eldridge, 
with a little nod of her head towards Matilda. 

" I will not dispute that," said the minister 
laughing. " She has cared fire and tea and 
bread and fish, hasn't she ? and you think 
I have only cared to come ' and see you. 
Don't you like that ? " 

" I used fur to have visits," said the poor 
old woman, " when I had a nice place, and 
was fixed up respectable. I had visits. Yes, 
I had. There don't no one come now. There 
won't no more on 'ern come. No more." 

" Perhaps you are mistaken, Mrs. Eldridge.

grave, " he sent others, but they did not 
come. They did not do what he gave them 
to do. And now, Mrs. Eldridge, we bring you 
a message from the Lord this little girl and

love him. You know you never have loved, 
or trusted, or obeyed him, in all your life. 
And now, the goodness of God leadeth thee 
to repentance." 

" There ain't much as a poor old thing like 
I can do," she said after a long pause. 

" You can trust the Lord that died for you, 




 

and love him, and thank him. You can give
