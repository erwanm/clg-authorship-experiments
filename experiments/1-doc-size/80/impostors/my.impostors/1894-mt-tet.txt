"I will cheerfully submit to all your require- 
ments, sir, up to two o'clock this afternoon, and 
will resume them after three, but cannot be confined 
to the house during that intermediate hour." 

"Why, may I ask?" 

"Because I have entered the Baptist communion, 
and by appointment am to be baptized in the river 
at that hour." 

"Oh, insanity! — it cannot be allowed!" 

Angelo answered with placid firmness: 

"Nothing shall prevent it, if I am alive." 

"Why, consider, my dear sir, in your condition 
it might prove fatal." 

A tender and ecstatic smile beamed from Angelo's 
eyes, and he broke forth in a tone of joyous fervency : 

"Ah, how blessed it would be to die for such a 
cause — it would be martyrdom!" 

"But your brother — consider your brother; you 
would be risking his life, too." 

"He risked mine an hour ago," responded Angelo, 
gloomily; "did he consider me ? " A thought swept 
through his mind that made him shudder. "If I 
had not run, I might have been killed in a duel on 
the Sabbath day, and my soul would have been lost 
—lost." 

"Oh, don't fret, it wasn't in any danger," said 
Luigi, irritably; "they wouldn't waste it for a little 
thing like that; there's a glass case all ready for it 
in the heavenly museum, and a pin to stick it up 
with." 

Aunt Patsy was shocked, and said: 

"Looy, Looy! — don't talk so, dear!" 





 

Rowena's soft heart was pierced by Luigi's un- 
feeling words, and she murmured to herself, "Oh, 
if I but had the dear privilege of protecting and 
defending him with my weak voice! — but alas! this 
sweet boon is denied me by the cruel conventions of 
social intercourse." 

"Get their bed ready," said Aunt Patsy to Nancy, 
"and shut up the windows and doors, and light 
their candles, and see that you drive all the mos- 
quitoes out of their bar, and make up a good fire in 
their stove, and carry up some bags of hot ashes 
to lay to his feet — " 

— "and a shovel of fire for his head, and a mus- 
tard plaster for his neck, and some gum shoes for 
his ears," Luigi interrupted, with temper; and 
added, to himself, "Damnation, I'm going to be 
roasted alive, I just know it!" 

"Why, Looy! Do be quiet; I never saw such 
a fractious thing. A body would think you didn't 
care for your brother." 

"I don't — to that extent, Aunt Patsy. I was 
glad the drowning was postponed a minute ago, but 
I'm not now. No, that is all gone by; I want to 
be drowned."
