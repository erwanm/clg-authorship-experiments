highest musical authorities have sanctioned. You 
can't help but admit that, ma." 

The argument was formidably strong; the old 
lady could not find any way around it; so, after 
thinking it over awhile she gave in with a sigh of 
discontent, and admitted that the daughter's posi- 
tion was probably correct. Being vanquished, she 
had no mind to continue the topic at that disad- 
vantage, and was about to seek a change when a 
change came of itself. A footstep was heard on the 
stairs, and she said: 

"There — he's coming!" 

"They, ma — you ought to say they — it's nearer 
right." 

The new lodger, rather shoutingly dressed but 
looking superbly handsome, stepped with courtly 
carriage into the trim little breakfast-room and put 
out all his cordial arms at once, like one of those 
pocket-knives with a multiplicity of blades, and 
shook hands with the whole family simultaneously. 
He was so easy and pleasant and hearty that all 
embarrassment presently thawed away and disap- 
peared, and a cheery feeling of friendliness and 
comradeship took its place. He — or preferably 
they — were asked to occupy the seat of honor at 
the foot of the table. They consented with thanks, 
and carved the beefsteak with one set of their hands 
while they distributed it at the same time with the 
other set. 





 

'Will you have coffee, gentlemen, or tea?" 
'Coffee for Luigi, if you please, madam, tea for 



me. 



"Cream and sugar?" 

"For me, yes, madam; Luigi takes his coffee 
black. Our natures differ a good deal from each 
other, and our tastes also." 

The first time the negro girl Nancy appeared in 
the door and saw the two heads turned in opposite 
directions and both talking at once, then saw the 
commingling arms feed potatoes into one mouth 
and coffee into the other at the same time, she had 
to pause and pull herself out of a faintness that 
came over her; but after that she held her grip and 
was able to wait on the table with fair courage. 

Conversation fell naturally into the customary 
grooves. It was a little jerky, at first, because 
none of the family could get smoothly through a 
sentence without a wabble in it here and a break 
there, caused by some new surprise in the way of 
attitude or gesture on the part of the twins. The 
weather suffered the most. The weather was all 
finished up and disposed of, as a subject, before the 
simple Missourians had gotten sufficiently wonted 
to the spectacle of one body feeding two heads to 
feel composed and reconciled in the presence of so 
bizarre a miracle. And even after everybody's 
mind became tranquilized there was still one slight 
distraction left: the hand that picked up a biscuit 
carried it to the wrong head, as often as any other 
way, and the wrong mouth devoured it. This was a
