two or three days, and yesterday he was out in 
the sun which appeared to affect him a good 
deal. At midnight he was taken with paralysis. 
But brief as the time was it found him ready. 


He seemed to have gleams of consciousness and 
knew me at intervals. His trust was staid upon 
God, and there was no fear, no shrinking." 

" He has been a good, upright man. Kenton 
always esteemed him highly." 

" He was more than that, Miss Churchill, he 
was an earnest Christian. If the household had 
been of one mind, workers in the vineyard, he 
would have lived a fuller and more joyous 
Christian life. But we are to work our way 
through hindrances. God gave him grace and 
strength and perfected him in good deeds. I 
feel as if I had lost my mainstay in the church. 
He was not a man of many words, but you 
could rely upon, him to the uttermost. And 
though I shall grieve for a true and staunch 
friend, I shall also rejoice that he has gone to 
his reward, better far than any earthly happiness.' 



" You loved him very much," said Miss 
Churchill, deeply moved. 

" I did indeed." 

" The loss is dreadful to his family." . 

"My heart ached for Richard. He and his 
father were tender friends, and the watching 
through long hours, the not being able to give 

him up, was agonizing in the extreme. Mrs. 
Fairlie was stunned by the suddenness." 

"I wonder if I could Le any comfort to 
her ? ; Miss Churchill questioned slowly. 

"I wish you would call to-morrow," said papa. 
"I don't know but I shall have to come to you 
and your brother now." 

" I am sure I should be glad to give you any 
assistance in my power. I have been thinking 
lately that we live quite too much for our- 
selves." 

"For the night cometh in which no man can 
work," said papa solemnly. 

An awe fell over us all. One and another 
dropped in to wonder at the occurrence. Sud- 
den deaths always shock a community greatly. 
Even the children did not want to play but sat 
on the porch steps and looked into vacancy. 
Louis went up stairs directly after supper, but 
I heard him pacing his room restlessly. I had 
put the little ones to bed and was going down 
stairs when he called. 

" Did you want anything ? ' I inquired. 
' No that i.s are you busy ? ' 

"Not especially." 

''I am going away so soon;' he said apolo 
getically.
