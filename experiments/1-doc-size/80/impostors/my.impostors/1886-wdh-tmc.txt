" Oh no ; that 's foolish," said the elder, with 
patient, sad kindness. " Who knows whether death 
is the end of trouble ? We must live things down, 
not die them down." He put his arm caressingly 
across the boy 's shoulder. 

" I can never live this down," said Lemuel. He 
added passionately, " I wish I could die ! " 

" No," said Evans. " You must cheer up. Think 
of next Saturday. It will soon be here, and then 
you'll be astonished that you felt so bad on 
Tuesday." 

He gave Lemuel a parting pressure with his arm, 
and turned to go upstairs. 

At the same moment the figure of Mrs. Harmon 's 
nephew, distracted, violent, burst up through the 
door leading to the basement. 

" Good heavens ! " exclaimed the editor, " is Mr. 
Harmon going to kick ? " 

" The house is on fire ! " yelled the apparition. 

A thick cloud of smoke gushed out of the elevator- 
shaft, and poured into the hall, which it seemed to 
fill instantly. It grew denser, and in another 
instant a wild hubbub began. The people appeared 
from every quarter and ran into the street, where 
some of the ladies began calling up at the windows 
to those who were still in their rooms. A stout 
little old lady came to an open window, and paid 
out hand over hand a small cable on which she 
meant to descend to the pavement ; she had carried 



 

this rope about with her many years against the 
exigency to which she was now applying it. Within, 
the halls and the stairway became the scene of frantic 
encounter between wives and husbands rushing down 
to save themselves, and then rushing back to save their 
forgotten friends. Many appeared in the simple 
white in which they had left their beds, with the 
addition of such shawls or rugs as chance suggested. 
A house was opened to the fugitives on the other 
side of the street, and the crowd that had collected 
could not repress its applause when one of them 
escaped from the hotel-door and shot across. It 
applauded impartially men, women, and children^ 
and, absorbed in the spectacle, no one sounded the 
fire-alarm ; the department began to be severely 
condemned among the bystanders before the engines 
appeared. 

Most of the ladies, in their escape or their purpose 
of rescue, tried each to possess herself of Lemuel, and 
keep him solely in her interest. " Mr. Barker ! Mr. 
Barker ! Mr. Barker ! : was called for in various so 
pranos and contraltos, till an outsider took up the cry 
and shouted, " Barker ! Barker ! Speech ! Speech ! " 
This made him very popular with the crowd, who in 
their enjoyment of the fugitives were unable to regard 
the fire seriously. A momentary diversion was caused 
by an elderly gentleman who came to the hotel-door, 
completely dressed except that he was in his stockings, 
and demanded Jerry. The humourist who had called 
for a speech from Lemuel volunteered the statement 
that Jerry had just gone round the corner to see 



 

a man. " I want him," said the old gentleman 
savagely. " I want my boots ; I can't go about in
