He congratulated himself on having got Toto in his 
power, since Toto was the only man who understood 
the ways of the " lost water." If he had before sus- 
pected that there was any one at large in Rome who 
knew as much he would have hesitated. But he had 
made the discovery of the man and had taken him 
prisoner at the same moment, and all danger in that 
quarter seemed to be removed. 





As for the material difficulty, he and Masin could 
smooth the way very much in two or three hours, and 
could substitute a solid wooden ladder for the one 
of rope in the well. Sabina was young, slight, and 
probably active, and with a little help she would have 
no difficulty in reaching the inner chamber. It might 
be well to cover the skeletons. Young girls were sup- 
posed to be sensitive about such things, and Malipieri 
had no experience of their ways. Nevertheless he had 
an inward conviction that Sabina would not go into 
hysterics at the sight. 

Old Sassi might not be able to get up the ladder, but 
once beyond the reach of social observation, he would 
trust Sabina to Malipieri and Masin for a quarter of an 
hour, and he could wait in the outer cellar. Malipieri 
had prepared him for this, and he had made no ob- 
jection, only saying that he should like to see the 
treasure himself if it could possibly be managed. In 
his heart, Malipieri hoped that it would prove too much 
for the old man and that he might have the pleasure of 
showing Sabina what he had found without having the old 
agent at his elbow. Toto would be locked in, upstairs, 
for the day. He could not get out by the door, and he 
would not risk breaking his legs by jumping from the 
window. The intermediate story of the Palazzo Conti 
was far too high for that. 

Malipieri calculated that if Sassi were punctual, 
Sabina would be at the door of the palace at a quarter- 
past five. At five minutes past, he came down, and 
sent the porter on an errand which would occupy at 



 

least half an hour even if executed with despatch. 
Masin would keep the door, he said. The old man was 
delighted to have an excuse for going out, and promised 
himself to spend a comfortable hour in a wine shop if he 
could find a friend. His wife, as there was so little to 
do, had found some employment in a laundry, to which 
she went in the morning and which kept her out all 
day. No one would see Sabina and Sassi enter, and if 
it seemed advisable they could be got out in the same 
way. No one biit Masin and Malipieri himself need 
ever know that they had been in the palace that 
afternoon. 

It was all very well prepared, by a man well accus- 
tomed to emergencies, and it was not easy to see how 
anything could go wrong. Even allowing more time 
than was necessary, Sabina's visit to the vaults could 
not possibly occupy much more than an hour. 



CHAPTER XII 

Malipibri was beginning to realize that his work in 
the vaults had been watched with much more interest 
than he had supposed possible, and that in some way or 
other news of his progress had reached various quarters. 
In the first place, his reputation was much wider than 
he knew, and many scholars and archaeologists through-
