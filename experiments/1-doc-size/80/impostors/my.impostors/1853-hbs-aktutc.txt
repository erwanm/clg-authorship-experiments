  on the top of the head; this extravasation was general, but that
  over the ear was a single spot; the butt-end of a cowhide would have
  sufficed for this purpose; an ordinary stick, a heavy one, would
  have done it; a succession of blows on the head, in a feeble woman,
  would lead to death, when, in a stronger one, it would not; saw no
  other appearance about her person, to account for her death, except
  those blows.

  Cross-examined.—To a patient in this woman’s condition, the blows
  would probably cause death; they were not such as were calculated to
  kill an ordinary person; witness saw the body twenty-four hours
  after her death; it was winter, and bitter cold; no disorganization,
  and the examination was therefore to be relied on; the blow behind
  the ear might have resulted from a fall, but not the blow on the top
  of the head, unless she fell head foremost; came to the conclusion
  of a succession of blows, from the extent of the extravasation; a
  single blow would have shown a distinct spot, with a gradual
  spreading or diffusion; one large blow could not account for it, as
  the head was spherical; no blood on the brain; the softening of the
  brain did not amount to much; in an ordinary dissection would have
  passed it over; anger sometimes produces apoplexy, which results in
  death; blood between the scalp and the bone of the skull; it was
  evidently a fresh extravasation; twenty-four hours would scarcely
  have made any change; knew nothing of this negro before; even after
  examination, the cause of death is sometimes inscrutable,—not usual,
  however.

  In reply.—Does not attribute the softening of the brain to the
  blows; it was slight, and might have been the result of age; it was
  some evidence of impairment of vital powers by advancing age.

  Dr. A. P. Hayne.—At request of the coroner, acted with Dr.
  Porcher; was shown into an outhouse; saw on the back of the corpse
  evidences of contusion; arms swollen and enlarged; laceration of
  body; contusions on head and neck; between scalp and skull
  extravasation of blood, on the top of head, and behind the right
  ear; a burn on the hand; the brain presented healthy appearance;
  opened the body, and no evidences of disease in the chest or
  viscera; attributed the extravasation of blood to external injury
  from blows,—blows from a large and broad and blunt instrument;
  attributes the death to those blows; supposes they were adequate to
  cause death, as she was old, weak and emaciated.

  Cross-examined.—Would not have caused death in a young and robust
  person.

  The evidence for the prosecution here closed, and no witnesses were
  called for the defence.

  The jury were then successively addressed, ably and eloquently, by
  J. L. Petigru and James S. Rhett, Esqrs., on behalf of the prisoner,
  and H. Bailey, Esq., on behalf of the state, and by B. F. Hunt,
  Esq., in reply. Of those speeches, and also of the judge’s charge,
  we have taken full notes, but have neither time nor space to insert
  them here.

  His Honor, Judge O’Neall, then charged the jury eloquently and ably
  on the facts, vindicating the existing law, making death the penalty
  for the murder of a slave; but, on the law, intimated to the jury
  that he held the act of 1740 so far still in force as to admit of
  the prisoner’s exculpation by her own oath, unless clearly disproved
  by the oaths of two witnesses; and that they were, therefore, in his
  opinion, bound to acquit,—although he left it to them, wholly, to
  say whether the prisoner was guilty of murder, killing in sudden
  heat and passion, or not guilty.

  The jury then retired, and, in about twenty or thirty minutes,
  returned with a verdict of “Not Guilty.”

There are some points which appear in this statement of the trial,
especially in the plea for the defence. Particular attention is called
to the following passage:

  “Fortunately,” said the lawyer, “the jury were of the
  country;—acquainted with our policy and practice; composed of men
  too honorable to be led astray by the noise and clamor out of
  doors. All was now as it should be; at least, a court of justice
  had assembled to which his client had fled for refuge and safety;
