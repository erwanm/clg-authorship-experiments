" Get ready and we will go out together," he 
said huskily. She had a maid who waited on her 
and dressed her, and who took her out for exer 
cise. She came down on the old porch and he 
lifted her into the phaeton. If she proffered her 
love again, had he any right to refuse ? 

Yet there was a great struggle within the man. 
How could he profane the sacred name of love, 
now that he understood it in its grand entirety ? 
She would never be capable of the heights to 
which he soared. But was not he leading a 
double life ? He put no one's name in these hours 
of wordless worship and Helen Otis would never 
know. But was it not laying a sinful adoration at 
her feet ? 

He gave up nearly all society again, only rarely 
dropping in at the Wards where he had been such 
a frequent and welcome visitor. 



Thirza remarked it and questioned him. 

" I think Bessie needs me more," he answered 
gravely. 

" She is well ? " hesitatingly. 

" Oh, quite well. She is rousing herself to a 
greater interest, but she shrinks from mingling 
with people. I just begin to realize how terrible 
a thing blindness is. I do not think she sees at 
all now. Thirza, pray that I may have strength 
to the end." The anguish in his voice pierced her. 

Bessie did indeed take a sudden turn. She 
dressed in her prettiest gowns and sat on the 
porch awaiting him. She appealed to him with 
a host of trivial questions, she longed for praise 
and flattery, she recounted her triumphs, and 
made him put away his book or paper and listen. 
Then she grew jealous and questioned him about 
the people he met. What was Thirza like in her 
own home ? Was Miss Otis coming this summer ? 

" I have not been there for a fortnight," he 
replied. Would Helen Otis come ? Oh, he hoped 
not. He found the exigent little lady needed 
a great deal of patience. He almost longed 
again for her indifference. She was very fitful. 
The old haunted feeling came back to her. When 
Roy was about, Aunt Hannah seemed to disappear. 

" Roy," she said one evening, " let us go some 
where else and live." 



 

" At a hotel ? " 

" Couldn't you go to some other city ? " 

He drew a long breath. " It would not be pos 
sible with my business interests here. But I might 
send you somewhere." 

" Me ? I can't go alone, I feel safest with you. 
Aunt Hannah's ghost has taken possession of this 
place. She hated me from the beginning." 

" Oh, no, you are quite mistaken.'* 

" Yes, she did. She can't even rest in her 
grave. Oh ! " And Bessie threw up one arm 
with a little cry.
