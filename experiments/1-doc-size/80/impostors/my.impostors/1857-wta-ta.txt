discovered the rude nut. If it had been a palace, it 
could not have been a more welcome retreat. It 
Is true the stormy wind had broken down the door, 
and the place was no better than a squirrel hole ; yet 
it suggested a thousand brilliant ideas of comfort, 
and luxury even, to our worn-out and hunted fd 
gitive. 

He entered the cabin. The floor was covered 
with straw, which completed his ideal of a luxurious 
abode. Raising up the door, which had fallen to the 
ground, he placed it before the aperture — thu- ex- 
cluding the cold air from his chamber. 

" I'm a lucky fellow," exclaimed Harry, a° he 
threw himself on (he straw. "This place will be a 

palace beside Jacob Wire's house. And I :an etaj 
here a month, if I like." 

Nestling closely under the side of the hu', he 
pulled the straw over him, and soon began to feel 
perfectly at home. Only one consideration troubled 
him. The commissary department of the establish- 
ment could not be relied on. There were no puik 
and potatoes in the house, no well-filled grain chest, 
no groceries, not even a rill of pure water at hand. 
This was an unpromising state of things ; and he 
began to see that there would be no fun in living in 
the woods, where the butcher and the baker would 
not be likely to visit him. 

Various means of supplying the deficiency sug- 
gested themselves. There were rabbits, partridges, 
and quails in the woods ; he might set a snare, and 
catch some of them. But he had no fire to cook 
them ; and Dr. Kane had not then demonstrated the 
healthy and appetizing qualities of raw meat. The 
orchards in the neighborhood were accessible ; but 
prudence seemed to raise an impassable barrier be- 
tween him and them. 

"While he was thus considering these matters, he 




dropped asleep, and forgot all about his stomach 
He was completely exhausted ; and no doubt the 
owls and bats were astonished as they listened to 
the sonorous sounds that came from the deserted 
cabin. 

Long and deep was his sleep. The birds sang 
their matin songs on the tree tops ; but he heard 
them not. The sun rose, and penetrated the chinks 
of the hut ; but the little wanderer still slumbered. 
The Rockville clock struck nine ; and he heard it 
not. 

I think it was Harry's grumbling stomach that 
finaUy wak^d him; and it was no wonder that neg- 
lected organ grew impatient under the injury put 
upon it, for Harry had eaten little or. nothing since 
his dinner at the poorhouse on the preceding day. 

Jumping out of the heap cf straw in which he had 
" cuddled " all night scarcely svithout moving, he left 
{he hut to reconnoitre his position. So far as security 
was concerned, it seemed to be a perfectly safe place. 
He could see nothing of the village jf Rockville, 
though, beyond the open space, he saw the top ot a 
chimney ; but it was at least half a mile distant 




Just then he did not feel much interested in th? 
scenery and natural advantages of the position. His
stomach was imperative, and he was faint from th ?
