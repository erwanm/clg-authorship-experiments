a tremendous resistance to itself. This re- 
sistance promises to be, at the least, as pow- 
erful as the force which it resists. The inex- 







orable rhythm has begun in the motion of 
thought. A theory should be a gun. It should 
never shoot without calculating on the recoil. 
The materialist did not calculate upon the 
recoil ; and the recoil has come. In the hun- 
ter's phrase, his weapon has kicked. 

It has been said of Lessing that he knew 
but one system of tactics, which was with 
fixed bayonet to run his rival through the 
body. " He made no prisoners. When the 
work was over there was nothing left of his 
antagonist." The skepticism of our day has 
made too many prisoners ; and her prisoners 
are escaping beneath her eyes. 

The interesting thing, however, about the 
whole matter is the point of the compass at 
which the dungeon walls have been broken. 
Or, to keep to our figure, it is the direction of 
motion in which the rhythm has swung. One 
who has thought up to a certain point on these 
questions will not hesitate to say that the psy- 
chical wave upon which we have been caught 
is the outcome — direct, logical, and legal — 
of the physical wave in which we have been 
buried. This is the law. It has taken an ex- 
traordinary form. This is the curiosity. 




We have been taught that rhythm is a 
complication ; that there is rhythm within 
rhythm, motion lateral and vertical, movement 
on an axis, and movement in an orbit and 
movement in a spiral ; in short, that oscillation 
is not a simple affair of two strokes. The 
vibration may start where it is not expected. 
The pulsation may hit athwart where logic was 
not great enough to look for it. This is pre- 
cisely what has happened. 
< If any of the priests and prophets of the 
materialistic philosophy had been told fifteen 
years ago, while they sat precipitating our 
souls into a sub-acetate in their laboratories, 
or offering us little icicles from the Glacial 
Period to replace the Easter lilies on the new- 
made grave, that more than one of the fore- 
most scientists of Great Britain would be to- 
day avowed believers in the psychical nature 
of obscure phenomena, such as it has hith- 
erto been considered good intellectual form to 
turn over to the juggler and the medium — 
but imagination cannot struggle beyond the 
learned smile with which such a suggestion 
would have been bowed out. On the certif- 
icate of the scientific world, mad Cassandra 



would have been incarcerated in an institu- 
tion offering all the modern improvements 
in alienism, had she foretold a vibration of 
thought like that of which this fact is the 
sonometer. 

The burliest positivist is not more puzzled 
at the present growth among us of the psy- 
chical life than the religious believer. As lit-
