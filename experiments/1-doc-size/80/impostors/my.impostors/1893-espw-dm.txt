respectfully. His elocution was inferior to 
his rival s. Three sentences settled that. 
But the material of his address was, it must 
be admitted, remarkably, even unexpectedly 
excellent. He compelled attention, and held 
what he had compelled. His thought was 
clear, strong, even original ; his style
practiced and charming. Alas, he was an older 
boy than Don, and his maturity "told." 
When he had finished his oration, he retired 
among fewer flowers and less enthusiasm 
than his rival; but followed by anxious 
looks upon the part of some of Donald 's 
friends. 



Fay did not look anxious. She looked 
startled. Her cheeks were brightly flushed, 
and her eyes flashed with a singular look. 
She made as if she would speak to her father, 
but changed her mind, and said nothing, sit 
ting lost in thought while the committee 
went out to make their decision. 

It was a shock, but it was not wholly a 
surprise, to many in that audience, when, 
after half an hour 's debate, the committee 
reported that the De Courtney prize was 
awarded to Thomas Z. Hallowell. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

THE GIRL AND THE COMMITTEE. 

To say that the announcement of the com 
mittee was a terrible blow to Donald Marcy 
is to say nothing at all about it. The 
sympathy of the audience and the judgment of 
the committee, as we know, had gone strongly

opinion on the platform and in the hall. 
The De Courtney prize was as good as given 
to Marcy, up to the moment that Tom Hal- 
lowell 's oration had snatched it so surprisingly 
away from him. Donald had under 
stood this perfectly well. Trusting to his 
unquestionably superior elocution, and underrating, 
as, alas, it proved, the force of his 
rival 's thought and the brilliancy of his style, 
Don had retired from the stage, pressing 
with Fay 's violets a confident hope of suc 
cess to his beating heart. 

The bolt of defeat struck him like light 
ning. He tried to make the best of it among 



 

the fellows, but lie was greatly shaken. His 
chum reached him in such time as it takes 
the report to follow the flash, and got him 
out of the green-room and away, as soon as 
was possible. 

"I I must go back and congratulate 
Hallo well," said Don, half-way down the 
steep, winding stairs, standing still, and 
looking confusedly at Jamie Fleet. 

"Well if you insist on it," hesitated 
Jamie. " I suppose it would be the thing. 
But I meant to spare you that, old fellow." 

" It 's the manly way," said Don. " I
