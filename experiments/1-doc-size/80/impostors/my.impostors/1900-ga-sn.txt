"Your informant was only half right," she said 
sadly. " I love him, but he cares nothing for me. 
He is the best, the kindest of friends. It is no 
wonder that I love him. I suppose I was bound to 
love the first man who treated me with affectionate 
respect. I reckon I 'd have fallen in love with Uncle 
if he 'd been younger. Perhaps in Europe I may 
get over it. But he does not love me." 

Betty rose and looked at her steadily. What was 
in the brain behind those sad reproachful eyes? She 
laid her hand on the girl's shoulder. 

" Harriet," she said solemnly, " give me your word 
of honor that you will not marry him without telling 
him the truth. It may be that he does not love you, 
but he might and if you were without hope you 
would be unhappy. Promise me." 

Down in the depths of those melancholy eyes there 
was a flash, then Harriet lifted her head and spoke 
with the solemnity of one taking an oath. 

" I promise," she said. " I will marry no man 
without telling him the truth." 




This time her tone carried conviction, and Betty, relieved, sought Sally Carter. 

" Nonsense ! " exclaimed Miss Carter, when Betty 
had related the interview. " He is in love with her, 
although for some reason or other he is making an 
elaborate effort to conceal it." 

"She spoke very convincingly," said Betty, who 
would not admit doubt. 

" Anything with a drop of negro blood in it will lie. 
It can't help it. I wish the race were exterminated." 

"I wish the English had left it in Africa. They 
certainly saddled us with an everlasting curse." 

She was tempted to wish that Mr. Walker had never 
discovered her address; but although she did not love 
Harriet, she was grateful still for the opportunity to 
rescue her from the usual fate of her breed. But 
assuredly she did not wish her old friend to be 
sacrificed. 

Again she observed him closely, and came to the 
conclusion that Harriet had spoken the truth. He 
was gayer than of old, but his health was better and 
he was in cheerful company, not living his days and 
nights in his lonely damp old house on the Potomac 
River. He appeared to enjoy talking to Harriet, but 
there was nothing loverlike in his attitude, and he 
was almost her guardian. True, he was occasionally 
moody and absent, but a man must retain a few of 
his old spots ; and if he avoided somewhat the cousin 
whom he had once loved to melancholy, it was doubt- 
less because she found him as uninteresting as she 
found all men but one, and was not at sufficient pains 
to conceal her indifference. And then she admitted 
with a laugh that in the back of her mind she had 




never acknowledged the possibility of his loving an- 
other woman. 

She but half admitted that she wished to believe 
no storm was gathering under her roof. She had no 
desire to handle a tragedy.
