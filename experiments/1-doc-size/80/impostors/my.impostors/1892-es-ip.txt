him, but in a moment he began anew. 
Again he hesitated, his eyes on the 
distant horizon; then suddenly he 
shouted, ''Strike him! Strike him once 
more!" And immediately to his 
startled audience he related a scene 
that was occurring at Rome, the attack 
on Domitian, his struggle with his assailant, his effort to tear out his eyes, 
the rush of conspirators, and finally 
the fall of the emperor, pierced by 
seven knives. 

The story may not be true, and yet 
if it were! 




Rome never was healthy. The 
tramontana visited it then as now, 
fever too, and sudden death. To emperors it was fatal. Since Ctcsar a 
malaria had battened on them all. 
Nerva escaped, but only through 
abdication. The mantle that fell from 
Domitian's shoulders on to his was so 
dangerous in its splendor, that, fearing 
the infection, he passed it to Ulpius 
Trajanus, the lustre undimmcd. 

Ulpius Trajanus, Trajan for brevity, 
a Spaniard by birth, a soldier by 
choice; one who had fought against 
Parthian and Jew, who had tramped 
through Pannonia and made it his own; 
a general whose hair had whitened on 



 



the field; a consul who had frightened 
nations, was afraid of the sheen of that 
purple which dazzled, corroded and 
killed. He bore it, indeed, but at 
arms-length. He kept himself free 
from the subtlety of its poison, from 
the microbes of Rome as well. 

He was in Cologne when Domitian 
died and Nerva accepted and renounced 
the throne. It was a year before he 
ventured among the seven hills. When 
he arrived you would have said another Augustus, not the real Augustus, 
but the Augustus of legend, and the 
late Mr. Gibbon. When he girt the new 
prefect of the pretorium with the immemorial sword, he addrt-ssed him in 
copy-book phrases — "If I rule wisely, 
use it for me; unwisely, against me." 

Rome listened open-mouthed. The 
change from Domitian's formula, 
"Your god and master orders It,"was'
too abrupt to be immediately understood. Before it was grasped Trajan 
was off again ; this time to the Danube 
and beyond it, to Dacia and her fens. 

Many years later — a century ortwo, 
to be exact — a Persian satrap loitered 
in a forum of Rome. "It is here," he 
declared, "I am tempted to forget that 
man is mortal." 

He had passed beneath a triumphal
