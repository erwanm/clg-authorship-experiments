 

between them, and when he went upstairs her 
door was locked. 

As it had been with that other offense, Cara 
found herself completely disabled in the moral 
conflict by the offender. Dane assumed his
injured air; and his wife, torn between her sweet 
impulse to be more than generous to him and her 
scathing consciousness that there are things which 
a wife must not overlook because that is the 
easiest way to live, fell back upon a tentative and 
terrible silence. No virago's tongue could have 
scourged Dane as this spiritual dignity did. He 
felt humiliated by the very sight of her, — and 
Dane never could bear to be made uncomfortable. 
Cara attended to his wants politely. But upon the 
frozen misery of her face he dared not dwell. They 
stood upon the opposite sides of a glacier whose 
stealthy current she could not cross, and he would 
not, if indeed he could. Their daily life took on 
the hopeless character which marriage alone, of 
all human relations, may acquire. 

Already they seemed to themselves to have been 
separated for a longer time than they had been 
united. Dane's frowning face darkened day by day, 
and one morning he hurled himself out of the 
house and aboard the first train to the city. He 
returned in the late May twilight, and she heard 

 

his step ring through the hall. He called her 
imperiously. 

"Cara? Cara! I wish to see you — at once, 
please." 

She was putting the baby to bed, but she obeyed 
immediately. Dane beckoned her into the office, 
and shut the door. 

" I may as well tell you what has happened," 
he began. 

" If it is anything worse — " she pleaded. But 
she thought : " What could be worse ? " Then her 
heart fused within her, and she cried out: — 

" Chanceford ! Chanceford ! We did love each 
other ! I don't want to make a mistake. I 'm not 
a hard woman. I could forgive . . . anything I 
ought to. Oh, I did love you ! I did love you ! If 
you only had one word to say to me ! " 

" I have three," replied Dane, stolidly. He put 
both hands on her shoulders — would he have held 
her off, or drawn her towards him ? She could not 
tell ; perhaps he did not know himself. He looked 
straight into her piteous eyes, and with great dis- 
tinctness and deliberation said: — 

" I have enlisted." 

Her face dropped against her hands upon the 
office table. The light from above selected her soft, 
brown hair and the contour of her womanly head. 



 

Dane felt as if these outlines were being etched 
upon his brain with a burning graver. 

" I have enlisted as a private," he said, " in this 
accursed war."
