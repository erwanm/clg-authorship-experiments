to enjoy their victory, as they evidently regarded it, until they were
at least twenty-five lengths ahead. Matt Randolph frequently looked
behind him to note the position of his rival.

All at once the oars of the Gildrock ceased to move, but every blade was
in proper position. Then came three rousing cheers from her crew, with a
tiger at the end. This was certainly crowing over the victory: The
Winooskis, except the coxswain, were vexed, and even angry. Some of them
began to grumble again; but Dory laughed, and called for silence in the
boat. The crew obeyed the order, for they had come to believe that Dory
knew what he was about "every time."

His crew soon knew what he was about, for he straightened up his wiry
little frame, and then began to sway it back and forward to regulate the
stroke of the rowers. In a few minutes every muscle was strained up to
its utmost tension. The Winooski began to fly through the water. There
was quite a smart sea on the lake, which Dory took into account, and
humored the boat as it met the waves.

The Gildrocks saw what Dory was doing, and Matt set his crew on the
strain again. At the end of a quarter of an hour the Gildrock was less
than a length ahead. The crew of the first class boat were in a terrible
state of excitement. They could see the other boat, and the effect upon
them was bad when the Winooski began to gain on them. The Gildrocks were
demoralized.

In three minutes more the Winooski had passed the other barge.

"Stand by to toss!" said Dory quietly.

The complimentary salute was given, but the coxswain declined to call
for three cheers.




CHAPTER III.

DORY DORNWOOD ARGUES THE QUESTION.


"How did we do it, Dory?" asked Life Windham, utterly astonished at the
result of the impromptu race, as were all the other members of the crew.

"We did it by minding our own business," replied the coxswain, as much
pleased as though he had won a rich prize.

"Can't we give them three cheers, Dory?" inquired Ben Ludlow.

"No cheers, fellows," replied Dory, shaking his head to emphasize his
decision.

"But the Gildrocks cheered when they got ahead of us," suggested Ben
Ludlow.

"No matter if they did; it was bad taste, and they crowed before they
were out of the woods."

"But I don't understand how it was that we happened to beat them,"
persisted Life Windham. "As you said, they have most of the older and
stouter fellows in their crew."

"They ought to beat us every time," added Ned Bellows.

"Age and strength alone won't make the best rowers," replied Dory
sagely. "Some of the fellows in the other boat are rather heavy and
clumsy, and, without boasting, I believe they have not got the knack of
rowing well yet."

"Do you think we have got the knack, Dory?" asked Phil Gawner.

"I think we have got it better than the fellows in the other boat,
though we have a good deal to learn yet. You have more spring,
elasticity, than the other fellows. But, fellows, we beat them by
discipline. You grumble because I don't want you to talk and look behind
you; but you obeyed orders, and that's what did the business."

"The first class fellows didn't talk or look behind them," said Life.

"They had no occasion to look behind them, for they could see our boat
