not easy to sec Margaret Vance, except on the society 
terms. With much sneering and scorning, he ful- 
filled the duties to Mrs. Horn without which he knew 
he should be dropped from her list ; but one might 
go to many of her Thursdays without getting many 



  

words with her nieco. Beaton hardly knew whether 
he wanted many ; the girl kept the charm of her 
innocent stylishness ; but latterly she wanted to talk 
more about social questions than about the psychical 
problems that young people usually debate so per- 
sonall}'. Son of the working-pedple as he was, 
Beaton had never cared anything about such 
matters ; he did not know about them or wish to 
know ; ho was perhaps too near them. Besides, 
there was an embarrassment, at least on her part, 
concerning the Dryfooses. She was too high-minded 
to blame him for having tempted her to her failure 
with them by his talk about them ; but she was 
conscious of avoiding  them in her talk. She hail 
decided not to renew the effort she had made in the 
spring ; because she could not do them good as 
fellow-creatures needing food and warmth and work, 
and she would not try to befriend them socially ; 
she had a horror of any such futile sentimentality. 
She would have liked to account to Beaton in this 
way for a course which she susjiec'el he must have 
heard their comments upon, but she did not quite 
know how to do it ; she could not be sure how much 
or how little he cared for them. Some tentative 
approaches which she made toward explanation were 
met with such eager disclaim of personal interest 
that she knew less than before what to think ; and 
she turned the talk from the sisters to the brother, 
whom it seemed she still continued to meet in their 
common work among the poor. 

" He seems very different," she ventured. 



  

"Oh, quite," said Beaton. "He's the kind of 
person that you might suppose gave the Catholics 
a hint for the cloistral life ; he 's a cloistered nature 
— the nature that atones and suffers for. But he 's 
awfully dull company, don't you think ? I never 
can get anything out of him." 

" lie 's very much in earnest." 

" Remorselessly. We 've got a profane and mun- 
dane creature there at the office who runs us all, 
and it 's shocking merely to see the contact of the 
two natures. When Fulkerson gets to joking Dry- 
foos — he likes to put his joke in the form of a pre- 
tence that Dryfoos is actuated by a selfish motive, 
that he has an eye to office, and is working up a 
political interest for himself on the East side — it's 
something inexpressible." 

" I should think so," said Miss Vance, with such 
lofty disapproval that Beaton felt himself included 
in it for having merely told what caused it. 

He could not help saying, in natural rebellion, 
"Well, the manof one ideais always alittle ridiculous." 

" when his idea is right ? " she demanded. " A 
right idea can't be ridiculous." 

"Oh, I only said the man that held it alone. 
lie 's flat ; he has no relief, no projection." 

She seemed unable to answer, and he perceived
