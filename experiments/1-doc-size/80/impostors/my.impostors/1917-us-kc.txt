" I can see what you mean," said Hal. " But I thought 
that in this case, right after the disaster, with the men so 
stirred — " 

The young Irishman smiled, rather sadly. "You're 
new at this game," he said. "If a mine-disaster was 
enough to win a strike, God knows our job would be easy. 
In Barela, just down the canyon from you, they've had 
three big explosions — they've killed over five hundred 
men in the past year ! " , 

Hal began to see how, in his inexperience, he had lost 
his sense of proportion. 

He looked at the two labour leaders, and recalled the 
picture of such a person which he had brought with him 
to North Valley — a hot headed and fiery agitator, luring 
honest workingmen from their jobs. But here was the 
situation exactly reversed I Here was he in a blaze of ex- 
citement — and two labour leaders turning the fire-hose on 
him! They sat quiet and business-like, pronouncing a 
doom upon the slaves of North Valley. Back to their 
black dungeons with them ! 

" What can we tell the men ? " he asked, making an ef- 
fort to repress his chagrin. 

" We can only tell them what I'm telling you — that 
we're helpless, till we've got the whole district organised. 
Meantime, they have to stand the gaff; they must do what 
they can to keep an organisation." 

" But all the active men will be fired ! " 

" No, not quite all — they seldom get them all." 

Here the stolid old German put in. In the last year 
the company had turned out more than six thousand men 
because of union activity or suspicion of it. 



 

" Six thousand ! " echoed Hal. " You mean from this 
one district  " 

" That's what I mean." 

" But there aren't more than twelve or fifteen thousand 
men in the district ! " 

" I know that." 

" Then how can you ever keep an organisation ? " 

The other answered, quietly, " They treat the new men 
the same as they treated the old." 

Hal thought suddenly of John Edstrom's ants! Here 
they were — building their bridge, building it again and 
again, as often as floods might destroy it ! They had not 
the swift impatience of a youth of the leisure-class, accus- 
tomed to having his own way, accustomed to thinking of 
freedom and decency and justice as necessities of life. 
Much as Hal learned from the conversation of these men, 
he learned more from their silences — the quiet, matter- 
of-fact way they took things which had driven him beside 
himself with indignation. He began to realise what it 
would mean to stand by his pledge to those poor devils in 
North Valley. He would need more than one blaze of ex- 
citement; he would need brains and patience and disci- 
pline, he would need years of study and hard work ! 



 Hal found himself forced to accept the decision 
of the labour-leaders. They had had experience, they 
could judge the situation. The miners would have to go
