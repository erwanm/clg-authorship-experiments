"Two so different!" said Rufus. "What's the matter with either
of them?"

"There is this the matter with both --that you do not know
them."

"I do know them!"

"From the rest of the world; but not from each other."

"Why not from each other?"

"Not enough for your liking or your judgment to tell which
would suit you."

"Why would not either suit?" said Rufus.

"I think -- if you ask me -- that one would not make you happy,
in the long run; and the other, with your present views and
aims, you could not make happy."

"Which is which?" said Rufus, laughing and drawing up a chair
opposite his brother.

"Either of them is which," said Winthrop. "Such being the
case, I don't know that it is material to inquire."

"It is very material! for I cannot be satisfied without the
answer. I am in earnest in the whole matter, Winthrop."

"So am I, very much in earnest."

"Which of them should I not make happy?" -- Rufus went on. --
"Rose? -- She is easily made happy."

"So easily, that you would be much more than enough for it."

"Then it is the other one whose happiness you are afraid for?"

"I don't think it is in much danger from you."

"Why? --what then?" said Rufus quickly.

"I doubt whether any one could succeed with her whose first
object was something else."

Rufus drew his fingers through his hair, in silence, for about
a minute and a half; with a face of thoughtful and somewhat
disagreeable consideration.

"And with the other one you think he could?"

"What?"

"Succeed? -- one whose first object, as you say, was something
else?"

"With the other I think anybody could."

"I don't know but I like that," said Rufus; -- "it is amiable.
She has more simplicity. She is a lovely creature!"

"If you ask your eye."

"If I ask yours!" --

"Every man must see with his own eyes," said Winthrop.

"Don't yours see her lovely?"

"They might, if they had not an inward counsellor that taught
them better."

"She is very sweet-tempered and sweet-mannered," said Rufus.

"Very."

"Don't you think so?"
