easily. " Are you ? " 

" I was to meet a friend there ; but he wrote to me 
that he was starting to Florence, and now " 

" He 's resting on the way ? Well, he 'll get here 
about as quick as he would in the ordinary course of 
travel. One good thing about Italy is, you don 't 
want to hurry ; if you did, you'd get left." 

Belsky stared at him in the stupefaction to which 
the American humor commonly reduced him. " If 
he gets left on the Grossetto line, he can go back and 
come up by Orvieto, no ? " 

" He can, if he isn 't in a hurry," Hinkle assented. 
" It 's a good way, if you 've  got time to burn." 

Belsky did not attempt to explore the American 's 
meaning. "Do you know," he asked, "whether Mrs. 
Lander and her young friend are still in Florence ? " 

" I guess they are." 

" It was said they were going to Venice for the 
summer." 

" That 's what the doctor advised for the old lady. 
But they don 't start for a week or two yet." 

" Oh ! " 

"Are you going to Miss Milray s, Sunday night? 
Last of the season, I believe."

The day that followed, Belsky haunted the hotel 
where Gregory was to arrive with his pupil, and where 
the pupil 's family were waiting for them. That night, 
long after their belated train was due, they came ; the 
pupil was with his father and mother, and Gregory 
was alone, when Belsky asked for him, the fourth or 
fifth time. 

" You are not well," he said, as they shook hands. 
" You are fevered ! " 

" I 'm tired," said Gregory. " We 've  had a bad 
time getting through." 

" I come inconveniently ! You have not dined, 
perhaps ? " 

" Yes, yes. I 've  had dinner. Sit down. How 
have you been yourself ? " 

" Oh, always well." Belsky sat down, and the 
friends stared at each other. " I have strange news 
for you." 

" For me ? " 

" You. She is here." 

" She ? " 

" Yes. The young girl of whom you told me. If 
I had not forbidden myself by my loyalty to you if
