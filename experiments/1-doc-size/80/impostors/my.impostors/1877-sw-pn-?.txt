his waggon," said Meredith laughing.
"Well--he wouldn't, would he?"
"I am afraid not. More's the pity."
"Why, Ditto?" said his sister. "What are ministers so much more than
other people?"
"They are the King's ambassadors," said Mr. Murray, taking the answer
upon himself. "And you know, Miss Flora, the ambassador of a king is
always treated as something more than other people."
Flora looked at him. "Mr. Murray," she said, "ministers do not seem like
that?"
"When they are the true thing, they do."
"But then besides," Maggie went on,--"how could anybody, how could that
good man care so much about a bell? What difference did it make
whether the bell was big or little?"
"Superstition"--said Flora.
"No, not exactly," responded Mr. Murray.
"That other man cared so much about his silver service, and this one
about his bell--they were both alike, but I don't understand it," said
Maggie.
"How would you like your father to have his table set with pewter
instead of silver?"
"O Uncle Eden! but that--"
"Or to drive a lame horse in his carriage?"
"But, Uncle Eden--"
"Or to wear a fustian coat?"
"But that's different, Uncle Eden."
"Yes, it is different. This concerns our own things; those matters of
the vessels and the bell concerned God's things."
"Then you approve of building very costly churches, sir?" asked
Meredith, whose head was running on churches lately.
"No, I do not."
"How then, Mr. Murray?" said Flora curiously.
"Because the temple of the Lord, the only one He cares much about, is
not built yet. I hold it false stewardship to turn aside the Lord's
money into brick and mortar and marble channels, while His poor have no
comfortable shelter, His waifs want bread, and a community anywhere in
the world are going without the light of life and the word of
salvation."
"What do you mean by the temple of the Lord, Uncle Eden?" said Maggie.
"I thought there was no temple of the Lord now?"
Mr. Murray pulled out his Bible from his pocket, opened and found a
place.
"'Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building, fitly
framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord; in whom ye
also are builded together, for an habitation of God through the
Spirit.'"
"How lovely!"--said Meredith.
"I didn't know that was in the Bible," said Flora.
"The literal Jewish temple was in part a type of this spiritual one. And
as in Solomon's building, 'the house was built of stone made ready
before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer, nor
axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building,'
but the walls rose silently,--so it is in this temple. The stones are
silently preparing, 'polished after the similitude of a palace;'
silently put in place; 'lively stones built up a spiritual house;' so
the Lord says, 'He that overcometh, will I make a pillar in the temple
of my God.'"
There was silence for a few moments, when Mr. Murray added, "That is
the temple, Meredith, that I think the Lord wants us to build and help
build. I think any diversion of the money or strength needed for this, a
sad, sad waste; and no honour to the Lord of the temple, though it may
be meant so. Come, go on with Pastor Breyhan; I like him. His was a
true-souled care for God's honour. I hope he got his bell."
Meredith went on.
"'To Ebel's question, "where he should drive to?" the answer was, "To
the Stechbahn;" that was a road which lay opposite the ducal castle.
Ebel's wonderment grew greater and greater, but Breyhan kept still,
slowly dismounted, gave orders to Ebel that he should drive to the inn,
but he himself went straight on to the ducal castle. As he had expected,
for it was just eleven o'clock, he found the duke sitting in front of
the entrance to the castle. For about this hour the duke was wont to sit
there and allow everybody, even the lowest of his vassals, to have free
access and speech of him. If there were no petitions, or complaints, or
the like on hand, he would converse in the kindest and most affable way
with everybody, and many a peasant could boast that in all
simple-heartedness he had shaken hands with his liege lord. Breyhan
found the duke (it was George William) surrounded by a number of people.
