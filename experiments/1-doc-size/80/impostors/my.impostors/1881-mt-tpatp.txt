thou would save thy neek, nothing but flight may 
stead thee. The man is this moment delivering up 
the ghost. ’Tis the priest, Father Andrew!” 

“God-a-mercy!” exclaimed Canty. He roused 
his family, and hoarsely commanded, “Up with ye 
all and fly — or bide where ye are and perish!” 

Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household 
were in the street and flying for their lives. John 
Canty held the prince by the wrist, and hurried hhn 
along the dark way, giving him this caution in a 
low voice: 

“Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not 
our name. I will choose me a new name, speedily, 
to throw the law’s dogs off the scent. Mind thy 
tongue, I tell thee!” 

He growled these words to the rest of the family: 

“If it so chance that we be separated, let each 
make for London Bridge; whoso findeth himself as 

far as the last linen-draper’s shop on the bridge, let 
him tarry there till the others be come, then will we 
flee into Southwark together.” 

At this moment the party burst suddenly out of 
darkness into light; and not only into light, but into 
the midst of a multitude of singing, dancing, and 
shouting people, massed together on the river- 
frontage. There was a line of bonfires stretching 
as far as one could see, up and down the Thames; 
London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge 
likewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash 
and sheen of colored lights, and constant explosions 
of fireworks filled the skies with an intricate com- 
mingling of shooting splendors and a thick rain of 
dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; 
everywhere were crowds of revelers; all London 
seemed to be at large. 

John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse 
and commanded a retreat; but it was too late. He 
and his tribe were swallowed up in that swarming 
hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from 
each other in an instant. We are not considering 
that the prince was one of his tribe; Canty still kept 
his grip upon him. The prince’s heart was beating 
high with hopes of escape now. A burly waterman, 
considerably exalted with liquor, fotmd himself 
rudely shoved by Canty in his efiEorts to plow 
through the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty’s 
shoulder and said: 

“Nay, whither so fast, friend? Dost canker thy 
soul with sordid business when all that be leal men 
and true make holiday?” 

“Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee 
not,” answered Canty, roughly; “take away thy 
hand and let me pass.” 

“Sith that is thy humor, thoult not pass till 
thou’st drunk to the Prince of Wales, I teE thee 
that,” said the waterman, barring the way resolutely. 

“Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make 
speed.” 

Other revelers were interested by this time. They 
cried out : 

“The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour 
knave drink the loving-cup, else wiE we feed him to 
the fishes.” 

j So a huge loving-cup was brought; the water- 
man, grasping it by one of its handles, and with his
