manual brush of her locks. 

" Oh, that, miss, I should be very sorry 
to tell you ! I 'd rather tuck away that white 
thing behind though I 'm blessed if it's my 
work." 

" Do then, please. I know where papa 
was," Maisie continued impatiently. 

" Well, in your place I would n't tell." 

" He was at the club the Chrysanthe- 
mum. So ! " 

"All night long? Why, the flowers shut 
up at night, you know ! " cried Susan Ash. 

" Well, I don't care " the child was at 
the door. " Sir Claude asked for me all 
alone?" 

" The same as if you was a duchess." 

Maisie was aware on her way downstairs 
that she was now quite as happy as one, 
and also, a moment later, as she hung round 
his neck, that even such a personage would 
scarce commit herself more grandly. There 
was moreover a hint of the duchess in the 





infinite point with which, as she felt, she 
exclaimed : " And this is what you call com- 
ing often?" 

Sir Claude met her, delightfully, in the 
same fine spirit. " My dear old man, don't 
make me a scene I assure you it's what 
every woman does that I look at. Let us

days at her mother's they had ever talked 
over had more of the perfection of security 
than his present prompt explanations. He 
was at his best in such an office and with 
the exception of Mrs. Wix the only person 
she had met in her life who ever explained. 
With him, however, the act had an authority 
transcending the wisdom of woman. It all 
came back, all the plans that always failed, 
all the rewards and bribes that she was 
perpetually paying for in advance and per- 
petually out of pocket by afterwards the 
whole complication to be dealt with intro- 
duced her on each occasion afresh to the 
question of money. Even she herself al- 
most knew how it would have expressed the 





strength of his empire to say that to shuffle 
away her sense of being duped he had only 
from under his lovely moustache to breathe 
upon it. It was somehow in the nature of 
plans to be expensive and in the nature of 
the expensive to be impossible. To be 
" involved " was of the essence of every- 
body's affairs, and also at every particular 
moment to be more involved than usual. 
This had been the case with Sir Claude's, 
with papa's, with mamma's, with Mrs. Beale's,
