and though they were convinced he had made some extra- 
ordinary purchase they were never to learn its nature. He 
only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables. " It's 
the sacred rage," Strether had had further time to say ; 
and this sacred rage was to become between them, for 
convenient comprehension, the description of one of his 
periodical necessities. It was Strether who eventually 
contended that it did make him better than they. But by 
that time Miss Gostrey was convinced that she didn't want 
to be better than Strether. 



PART SECOND 



IV 

THOSE occasions on which Strether was, in association 
with the exile from Milrose, to see the sacred rage 
glimmer through would doubtless have their due periodicity ; 
but our friend had meanwhile to find names for many other 
matters. On no evening of his life perhaps, as he re- 
flected, had he had to supply so many as on the third of 
his short stay in London ; an evening spent by Miss 
Gostrey's side at one of the theatres, to which he had found 
himself transported, without his own hand raised, on the 
mere expression of a conscientious wonder. She knew her 
theatre, she knew her play, as she had known triumphantly, 
for three days, everything else, and the moment filled- to 
the brim, for her companion, that apprehension of the 
interesting which, whether or no the interesting happened 
to filter through his guide, strained now to its limits his 
brief opportunity. Waymarsh had not come with them ; 
he had seen plays enough, he signified, before Strether had 
joined him — an affirmation that had its full force when his 
friend ascertained by questions that he had seen two and a 
circus. Questions as to what he had seen had on him, indeed, 
an effect only less favourable than questions as to what he 
hadn't. He liked the former to be discriminated ; but 
how could it be done, Strether asked of their constant 
counsellor, without discriminating the latter ? 

Miss Gostre)' had dined with him at his hotel, face to 
face over a small table on which the lighted candles had 
rose-coloured shades ; and the rose-coloured shades and 
the small table and the soft fragrance of the lady — had any- 
thing to his mere sense ever been so soft ? — were so many 
touches in he scarce knew what positive high picture. He 
had been to the theatre, even to the opera, in Boston, with 
Mrs. Newsome, and been more than once her only escort ; 
but there had been no little confronted dinner, no pink 







lights, no whiff of vague sweetness, as a preliminary : one 
of the results of which fact was that at present, mildly rue- 
ful, though with a sharpish accent, he actually asked 
himself why there hadn't. There was much the same 
difference in his impression of the noticed state of his 
companion, whose dress was " cut down," as he believed 
the term to be, in respect to shoulders and bosom, in a 
manner quite other than Mrs. Newsome's, and who wore 
round her throat a broad red velvet band with an antique 
jewel — he was rather complacently sure it was antique — 
attached to it in front. Mrs. Newsome's dress was never 
in any degree " cut down," and she never wore round her 
throat a broad red velvet band ; if she had, moreover, 
would it ever have served so to carry and complicate, as he 
now almost felt, his vision ? 

It would have been absurd of him to trace into ramifica- 
tions the effect of the ribbon from which Miss Gostrey's 
trinket depended, had he not, for the hour, at the best, J 
been so given over to uncontrolled perceptions. What was
