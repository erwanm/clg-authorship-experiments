candle above her head, until her mistress, having hesitated 
for an instant upon the threshold of the farther, to gather 
breath or resolution, turned the bolt of the door, and disap 
peared from the loving eyes watching her. 

There was a handful of smouldering coals and a smoking 
log or two in the fireplace. A solitary candle was upon the 
mantel, but its yellow flame gave light enough to enable 
Helen to recognize the person who advanced to meet her. 

It was not Robert, but Aleck Lay ! 





CHAPTER X. 

"ALECK!" 

"Helen!" 

In the agitation of the moment they forgot the more for 
mal style of address they had employed towards each other 
of late. Their hands were joined, too, in a clasp altogether 
different from the cold, passive touch they were used to exchange at their infrequent meetings. When Helen would 
have withdrawn hers she found it held fast, nor was it released after Aleck had led her to a chair, and placed himself 
beside her. Her gaze of wondering confusion was answered 
by one so intense, so eloquent of love and compassion, that 
her heart thrilled, while she trembled with apprehension

better, than if he had suspended his action for a few days or 
months ! Now let me hear all !" 

" Can you bear it !" he asked, doubtfully, looking in unspoken admiration at the noble face, tintless yet, but pure

I do not think that it can." 

" Robert left home this morning early, shortly after the 
receipt of a letter which was brought to him by one of Colonel Floyd's servants " 

" Gabriel ! Yes, I know !" she assented. " It was from 
me !" 

" Indeed ! I thought I recognized your cousin Lily's 
handwriting in the superscription." 

" You were mistaken ! I sent it." 

Aleck went on. 

" He ordered his horse at half-past nine, that he might 
keep an appointment at ten. I suspected that it was in 
obedience to a summons from the writer of the letter, both

was confirmed in my surmise by a brief conversation we
