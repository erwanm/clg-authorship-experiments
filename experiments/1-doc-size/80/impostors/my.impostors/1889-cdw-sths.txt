rights and resisted this crossing. Hence the provincial and railroad
conflict of the fall of 1888. The province built the new road, but
it was alleged that the Northern Pacific was the real party, and that
Manitoba has so far put itself into the hands of that corporation.
There can be no doubt that Manitoba will have its road and connect the
Northern Pacific with the Saskatchewan country, and very likely will
parallel the main line of the Canadian Pacific. But whether it will get
from the Northern Pacific the relief it thought itself refused by the
Canadian, many people in Winnipeg begin to doubt; for however eager
rival railways may be for new territory, they are apt to come to an
understanding in order to keep up profitable rates. They must live.

I went down on the southern branch of the Canadian Pacific, which runs
west, not far from our border, as far as Boissevain. It is a magnificent
wheat country, and already very well settled and sprinkled with
villages. The whole prairie was covered with yellow wheat-stacks, and
teams loaded with wheat were wending their way from all directions to
the elevators on the line. There has been quite an emigration of Russian
Mennonites to this region, said to be 9000 of them. We passed near two
of their villages—a couple of rows of square unbeautiful houses facing
each other, with a street of mud between, as we see them in pictures
of Russian communes. These people are a peculiar and somewhat mystical
sect, separate and unassimilated in habits, customs, and faith from
their neighbors, but peaceful, industrious, and thrifty. I shall have
occasion to speak of other peculiar immigration, encouraged by the
governments and by private companies.

There can be no doubt of the fertility of all the prairie region of
Manitoba and Assiniboin. Great heat is developed in the summers, but
cereals are liable, as in Dakota, to be touched, as in 1888, by early
frost. The great drawback from Winnipeg on westward is the intense cold
of winter, regarded not as either agreeable or disagreeable, but as
a matter of economy. The region, by reason of extra expense for fuel,
clothing, and housing, must always be more expensive to live in than,
say, Ontario.

The province of Manitoba is an interesting political and social study.
It is very unlike Ontario or British Columbia. Its development has been,
in freedom and self-help, very like one of our Western Territories,
and it is like them in its free, independent spirit. It has a spirit
to resist any imposed authority. We read of the conflicts between
the Hudson’s Bay and the Northwestern Fur companies and the Selkirk
settlers, who began to come in in 1812. Gradually the vast territory
of the North-west had a large number of “freemen,” independent of any
company, and of half-breed Frenchmen. Other free settlers sifted in.
The territory was remote from the Government, and had no facilities
of communication with the East, even after the union. The rebellion of
1870-71 was repeated in 1885, when Riel was called back from Montana
to head the discontented. The settlers could not get patents for their
lands, and they had many grievances, which they demanded should be
redressed in a “bill of rights.” There were aspects of the insurrection,
not connected with the race question, with which many well-disposed
persons sympathized. But the discontent became a violent rebellion,
and had to be suppressed. The execution of Riel, which some of the
Conservatives thought ill-advised, raised a race storm throughout
Canada; the French element was in a tumult, and some of the Liberals
made opposition capital out of the event. In the province of Quebec it
is still a deep grievance, for party purposes partly, as was shown in
the recent election of a federal member of Parliament in Montreal.

Manitoba is Western in its spirit and its sympathies. Before the
building of the Canadian Pacific its communication was with Minnesota.
Its interests now largely lie with its southern neighbors. It has a
feeling of irritation with too much federal dictation, and frets under
the still somewhat undefined relations of power between the federal
and the provincial governments, as was seen in the railway conflict.
Besides, the natural exchange of products between south and
north—between the lower Mississippi and the Red River of the North
and the north-west prairies—is going to increase; the north and south
railway lines will have, with the development of industries and exchange
of various sorts, a growing importance compared with the great east and
west lines. Nothing can stop this exchange and the need of it along our
whole border west of Lake Superior. It is already active and growing,
even on the Pacific, between Washington Territory and British Columbia.

For these geographical reasons, and especially on account of similarity
of social and political development, I was strongly impressed with the
notion that if the Canadian Pacific Railway had not been built when it
was, Manitoba would by this time have gravitated to the United States,
and it would only have been a question of time when the remaining
