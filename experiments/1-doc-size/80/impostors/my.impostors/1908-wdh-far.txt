battles. 

Mrs. Westangle took her praises as passively, if not 
as modestly, as Verrian received his. She made no 
show of disclaiming them, but she had the art, invalu- 
able in a woman who meant to go far in the line she had 
chosen, of not seeming to have done anything, or of 
not caring whether people liked it or not. Verrian 
asked himself, as he watched her twittering back at 
those girls, and shedding equally their thanks and 
praises from her impermeable plumage, how she would 
have behaved if Miss Shirley's attempt had been an 
entire failure. He decided that she would have ignored 
the failure with the same impersonality as that with 
which she now ignored the success. It appeared that in 
one point he did her injustice, for when he went up to 
dress for dinner after the long stroll he took towards 
night he found a note under his door, by which he must 
infer that Mrs. Westangle had not kept the real facts 
of her triumph from the mistress of the revels. 

"Dbae Me. Veeeiait, â€” I am not likely to see you, 
but I must thank you. M. Shieley. 

" P. S. Don't try to answer, please." 

Verrian liked the note, he even liked the impulse 
which had dictated it, and he understood the impulse; 
but he did not like getting the note. If Miss Shirley 
meant business in taking up the line of life she had 




professed to have entered upon seriously, she had better, 
in the case of a young man whose acquaintance she had 
chanced to make, let her gratitude wait. But when 
did a woman ever mean business, except in the one great 
business ? 



XIV 

To have got that sillily superfluous note to Verrian 
without any one's knowing besides, Miss Shirley 
must have stolen to his door herself and slipped it 
under. In order to do this unsuspected and unseen, 
she must have found out in some sort that would not 
give her away which his room was, and then watched 
her chance. It all argued a pervasiveness in her, after 
such a brief sojourn in the house, and a mastery of 
finesse that he did not like, though, he reflected, he was 
not authorized to like or dislike anything about her. 
He was thirty-seven years old, and he had not lived 
through that time, with his mother at his elbow to 
suggest inferences from facts, without being versed in 
wiles which, even when they were honest, were always 
wiles, and in lures which, when they were of the most 
gossamer tenuity, were yet of texture close enough to 
make the man who blundered through them aware that 
they had been thrown across his path. He understood, 
of course, that they were sometimes helplessly thrown 
across it, and were mere expressions of abstract woman 
with relation to abstract man, but that did not change 
their nature. He did not abhor them, but he believed 
he knew them, and he believed now that he detected 
one of them in Miss Shirley's note. Of course, one 
could take another view of it. One could say to one's 
self that she was really so fervently grateful that she 
could not trust some accident to bring them together in 
a place where she was merely a part of the catering, 

 

as she said, and he was a guest, and that she was ex- 
cusable, or at least mercifully explicable, in her wish 
to have him know that she appreciated his goodness. 
Verrian had been very good, he knew that; he had 
saved the day for the poor thing when it was in danger
