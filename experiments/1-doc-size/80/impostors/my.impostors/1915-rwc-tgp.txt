Warner, who were advancing, shooting as they came on; then, with a
savage glance at Philippa, he fired at her once more, turned, mounted
the roadside bank in a single leap, and ran swiftly along the hedge,
evidently looking for an opening into the field beyond.

When he found one, he wriggled through and was off like a hare, across
the fields and headed for the river, before Halkett and Warner could
discover his avenue of escape.  Checked for a few moments, they ranged
the thorny hedge up and down, like baffled beagles.  They had overrun
the trail.

Warner was already within speaking distance of Philippa when the girl
hailed him.

"Are you hurt?" he called across to her, where she stood knee-deep among
the roadside weeds, trying to draw together the points of her torn
bodice, to cover her throat and shoulders.

"The tire burst.  I have a few scratches!"

"Did he get the papers?" shouted Halkett.

She drew both envelopes from her bosom, and shook them high with a
gesture of defiance.  Then, replacing them, she made a funnel of her
hands and called out to them:

"He crawled under the hedge by that third telephone pole behind you!
You have come too far this way!  No—the other pole!  Wait a moment,
Mr. Warner——"

Still calling out her directions in her clear, calm voice, she started
to limp down the road toward them; and Warner glanced back at her for a
moment; then he suddenly flung up his arm and shouted:

"Philippa!  Look out for that car behind you!"

The girl turned, saw the automobile coming, stepped aside into the ditch
as a cloud of white dust obscured her.

Before she realized that the car had stopped, three men had jumped out
into the ditch and caught hold of her.

Warner heard her cry out; started to run toward her; saw her flung
struggling into the car; saw Wildresse rise and strike her with his
great fist and knock her headlong across the back seat, where she lay,
her disheveled head hanging down over the rear of the tonneau.  Then the
car started.  As she hung there, blood dripping from her mouth, she
reached blindly toward her breast, drew out the envelopes, and dropped
them in the wake of the moving car.

They fluttered along behind it for a moment, drawn into the dusty
suction, then they were whirled away right and left into the roadside
ditches.

Evidently nobody in the car except Philippa knew what she had done, for
the car, at top speed, dashed on toward the north.

Halkett ran up and found Warner gazing vacantly after the receding
machine, pistol leveled, but not daring to shoot.  Then they both saw
Wildresse jerk the half senseless girl upright, saw him strike her again
with the flat of his huge hand so heavily that she crumpled and dropped
back into the corner of the seat.

"God!" whispered Halkett at Warner’s elbow.  "Did you see that?"

Warner, as white as death, made no reply.  The ear had vanished, but he
still stood there staring at the distant cloud of dust settling slowly
in the highway. Presently Halkett walked forward, picked up the two
envelopes, pocketed them, and returned swiftly to where the American
still stood, his grim features set, the red stain from his bitten lip
streaking his chin.

"Warner?"

"Yes?" he answered steadily.

"We’d better start after that man at once."

"Certainly."
