DR. THORNE (more gently). What did you do it for, Cleo? You know I
warned you about that habit. You know I took the laudanum away from you.

CLEO. But you could not cork up the Limited Express--could you?

DR. THORNE. It was a dreadful death! Tell me, how do you fare? Where do
you live? Do you suffer? What is your lot?

CLEO (with sudden reserve, and not without dignity) We suicides have
our own fate. We bear it. We do not reveal it.

DR. THORNE (uncomfortably). Well--I must bid you good-morning.

CLEO (savagely). At least, I gained something--if I lose all. Of
course, it never dawned on you that this was all my scheme?

DR. THORNE (in dismay). Your scheme?

CLEO (past control, raves). Oh, I had watched my chance for years. I
knew you--your mad moods, your black temper.... Yourself slew
yourself, Esmerald Thorne. Your own weakness gave me my opportunity. I
waited for my moment. I sat in the buggy beside you.... I sometimes did
that when your evil had you. (I couldn’t get there when you were good,
you know.) I tried to take the reins. I tried to get the whip--I could
not do it. I meant to hit the horse--my arm was held. (There are
always so many of these holy busybodies about--angels and messengers of
sanctity--to interfere with one!) Oh, then I sprang out--over the wheel
into the street. You didn’t see me, but Donna did. When she shied I
clung to her bit. And then she bolted.... It was a very simple thing.

(DR. THORNE recoiling slowly, an expression of cold horror chills his
features.)

CLEO (still raving). Yes, I’ve murdered you--if you will--and Mary
Fayth besides. And I’ve broken Helen’s heart. Do you suppose that
counts? Who counts? Nobody on earth, or in heaven, or in hell. I’ve got
you away from your wife.... And in earth, or in heaven, or in hell,
I’ll have you yet....

DR. THORNE (throwing out his hands; holds her off with evidences of
unbearable repulsion; speaks with difficulty). And I pitied you a
moment since. Now I cannot scorn you. It is too fine a word.

CLEO (more calmly). I can abide my time.

       Enter LADDIE, running rapidly.

LADDIE. Papa, Papa! Oh, I missed you, Papa!

CLEO (starting). I did not know the child was dead! (Looks
disconcerted.)

DR. THORNE (catches the child, and holds him to his heart; speaks).
No. You only knew you left him fatherless. (With much agitation,
continues.) How did you get here, Laddie? How did you find the way?
Papa hadn’t forgotten his little boy. I was coming right back to you, my
son.

LADDIE (mysteriously; looking about). A man with wings brought me. We
flowed over.... He is waiting out there to take us back. (Observing
CLEO, LADDIE slips down to the ground, and backs up against his
father’s knees; points at the woman.) Papa, I don’t like that lady.

DR. THORNE (cruelly). My son, I cannot deny that I respect your taste.
(Clasps the boy to his heart again; then puts him down once more, and,
with a fine motion, holds the child at arm’s-length between himself and
the woman.)

CLEO (averting her face). I perceive the importance of the obstacle. I
admit ... that to love a man who is the father of another woman’s
child--

DR. THORNE (interrupting). And who loves the mother of his child--

(CLEO sobs.)

DR. THORNE. Come, Laddie. (He does not glance at the woman again.)

       [Exeunt DR. THORNE and LADDIE.
