and salt; stir in the flour to a smooth batter, and beat the yeast
in well. Set to rise in a buttered pudding-dish, in which it must be
baked and sent to table. Or, if you wish to turn it out, set to rise
in a well-buttered mould. It will not be light under six hours. Bake
steadily three-quarters of an hour, or until a straw thrust into it
comes up clean. Eat while hot.

This is the genuine old-fashioned Sally Lunn, and will hardly give
place even yet to the newer and faster compounds known under the same
name.


SALLY LUNN. (No. 2.) 

    1 scant quart flour.
    4 eggs.
    1 teacupful milk.
    1 teacupful lard and butter mixed.
    1 teaspoonful cream-tartar.
    ½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.
    1 teaspoonful salt.

Beat the eggs very light, yolks and whites separately, melt the
shortening, sift the cream-tartar into the flour; add the whites the
last thing.


POTATO BISCUIT.

    8 potatoes of medium size, mashed very fine.
    4 tablespoonfuls butter, melted.
    2 cups milk, blood-warm.
    1 cup yeast.
    Flour to make a thin batter.
    2 tablespoonfuls white sugar.

Stir all the above ingredients together except the butter, and let the
sponge rise until light—four or five hours will do; then add the melted
butter with a little salt and flour, enough to make soft dough. Set
aside this for four hours longer, roll out in a sheet three-quarters of
an inch thick, cut into cakes; let these rise one hour, and bake.


MRS. E——‘S BISCUIT (Soda.) 

    1 quart flour.
    2 heaping tablespoonfuls of lard.
    2 cups sweet—if you can get it—new milk.
    1 teaspoonful soda.
    2 teaspoonful cream-tartar.
    1 saltspoonful of salt.

Rub the soda and cream-tartar into the flour, and sift all together
before they are wet; then put in the salt; next the lard, rubbed into
the prepared flour quickly and lightly; lastly, pour in the milk.
Work out the dough rapidly, kneading with as few strokes as possible,
since handling injures the biscuit. If properly prepared the dough
will have a rough surface and the biscuit be flaky. The dough should
also be very soft. If the flour stiffen it too much, add more milk.
Roll out lightly, cut into cakes at least half an inch thick, and bake
in a quick oven. The biscuit made by the friend from whom I had this
receipt were marvels of lightness and sweetness. I have often thought
of them since with regretful longing, when set down to so-called
“soda-biscuit,” marbled with greenish-yellow streaks, and emitting,
when split, an odor which was in itself an eloquent dissuasive to an
educated appetite. Few cooks make really good, quick biscuit—why, I am
unable to say, unless upon the principle of “brains will tell.” I have
had more than one in my kitchen, who, admirable in almost every other
respect, were absolutely unfit to be intrusted with this simple yet
delicate manufacture. The common fault is to have too “heavy a hand”
with soda, and to “guess at” the quantities, instead of measuring them.
Eat while warm.


GRAHAM BISCUIT. 

    3 cups Graham flour.
    1 cup white flour.
    3 cups milk.
    2 tablespoonfuls lard.
