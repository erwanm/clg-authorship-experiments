  "DEAR SIR ROGER:--I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your
  letter of the 23d inst., in which you submitted to his Imperial
  Majesty's Government a proposal for the formation of an Irish
  brigade which would be pledged to fight only for the cause of
  Irish nationalism, and which is to be composed of any Irish
  prisoners of war willing to join such a regiment.

  "In reply I have the honour to inform you that his Imperial
  Majesty's Government agrees to your proposal and also to the
  conditions under which it might be possible to train an Irish
  brigade. These conditions are set out in the declaration enclosed
  in your letter of the 13th inst., and are given at foot. I have
  the honour to be, dear Roger, your obedient servant,

  "For your information I enclose Zimmerman's letter to Sir Roger,
  and also the text of Articles 6 and 7, being part of our first
  agreement with Sir Roger Casement.

  "You will note particularly the Article numbered 7.

  "This paragraph, unfortunately, still postpones your suggested
  attempt to seize on the high seas a British or neutral steamer
  loaded with arms and munitions, and make a landing from her on the
  Irish Coast.

  "But, in the meantime, is it not possible for you to seize one of
  the large ore steamers on the Great Lakes, transfer to her
  sufficient explosives, take her into the Welland Canal and blow up
  the locks?

  "No more valuable service could be performed by Irishmen; no
  deadlier blow delivered at England.

  "I am, my dear Skeel, your sincere friend and comrade,

  "P. S.--Herewith appended are Articles 6 and 7 included in the
  Casement convention:

  "Text of Articles 6 and 7 of the convention concluded between Sir
  Roger Casement and the German Government:

  "6. The German Imperial Government undertakes 'under certain
  circumstances' to lend the Irish Brigade adequate military
  support, and to send it to Ireland abundantly supplied with arms
  and ammunition, in order that once there it may equip any Irish
  who would like to join it in making an attempt to re-establish
  Ireland's national liberty by force of arms.

  "The 'special circumstances' stipulated above are as follows:

  "In case of a German naval victory which would make it possible to
  reach the Irish coast, the German Imperial Government pledges
  itself to despatch the Irish Brigade and a German expeditionary
  corps commanded by German officers, in German troopships, to
  attempt a landing on the Irish coast.

  "7. It will be impossible to contemplate a landing in Ireland
  unless the German Navy can gain such a victory as to make it
  really likely that an attempt to reach Ireland by sea would
  succeed. Should the German Navy not win such a victory, then a use
