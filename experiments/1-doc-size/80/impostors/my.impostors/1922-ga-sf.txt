other end of the table and Mrs. McLane and 
Mrs. Ballinger sat beside him. She interested 
him for the first time and he adroitly drew her 
history from his mentor (not that he deluded 
that astute lady for an instant, but she dearly 
loved to gossip). 

"She is going through one of those 
crises that all young wives must expect,'' she 
concluded. "If it isn't one thing it's another. 
She is still very young, and inclined to be romantic. She expected too much — of a husband, 
mon dieu! Of course she is lonely or thinks 
she is. Too bad youth never can realize that it 
is enough to be young. And with beauty, and 
means, and position, and charming frocks! She

approached she drew her hand caressingly 
across a shelf devoted to the poets. The other 
women were gossiping at the end of the long 
room. 

"You are fond of books !" he said abruptly. 

She had not noticed his reappearance. She 
was startled and exclaimed passionately, " I
