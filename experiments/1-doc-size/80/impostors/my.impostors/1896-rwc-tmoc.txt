ENVOI.


 I.

 When shadows pass across the grass
  And April breezes stir the sedge,
  Along the brimming river's edge
    I trail my line for silver trout,
  And smoke, and dream of you, my lass,
    And wonder why we two fell out,
    And how the deuce it came about.

 II.

 When swallows sheer the meadow-mere
  And thickets thrill with thrushes' hymns,
  Along the mill-pond's reedy rims
    I trail my line for shining dace;
  But how can finny fishes cheer
    A fellow, if he find no grace
    In your sweet eyes and your dear face?

 III.

 Let thrushes wing their way and sing
  Where cresses freshen pebbled nooks;
  By silent rills and singing brooks
    I pass my way alone, alas!
  With your dear name the woodlands ring--
    Your name is murmured by the grass,
    By earth, by air, all-where I pass.

 IV.

 The painted bream may swim the stream--
    I'll cast no line to-day, pardi!
  In vain the river-ripples gleam,
    In vain the thrushes' minstrelsy.
  Vain is the wind that whispers, "Lo!
  Thy fish are waiting--Angler, go!"

 V.

 Will you forgive if I forgive?
  Life is too sad, I think, to live
  Alone, and dream and smoke and fish;
  I'll say "Forgive" first--if you wish?

 VI.

 For at that word, the Sorcery
  Of Love shall change the earth and sky
  To Paradise, with cherubim
  Instead of birds on every limb.

 VII.

 Rivers shall sing our rhapsody;
  The vaulted forest, tree by tree,
  High hung with tapestry, shall glow
  With golden pillars all a-row.

 VIII.

 And down the gilded forest aisle
  Shy throngs of violets shall smile
  And kiss your feet from tree to tree
  While blue-bells droop in courtesy.

 IX.

 And if the sun incarnadine
  The clouds--green leaves shall be your screen;
  And if the clouds with jealousy
  Should weep--we'll beg of some kind tree
  A moment's hospitality.
