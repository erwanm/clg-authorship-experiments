harvest. He accordingly repaired to his usual place of business,
succeeded in obtaining six customers, which yielded him sixty cents.
He then went to a restaurant, and got some breakfast. It was now
half-past nine, and Dick, feeling that it wouldn't do to be late,
left his box in charge of Johnny Nolan, and made his way to the
bank.

The officers had not yet arrived, and Dick lingered on the outside,
waiting till they should come. He was not without a little
uneasiness, fearing that Travis might be as prompt as himself, and
finding him there, might suspect something, and so escape the snare.
But, though looking cautiously up and down the street, he could
discover no traces of the supposed thief. In due time ten o'clock
struck, and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown
open, and our hero entered.

As Dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last
nine months, the cashier had come to know him by sight.

"You're early, this morning, my lad," he said, pleasantly. "Have you
got some more money to deposit? You'll be getting rich, soon."

"I don't know about that," said Dick. "My bank-book's been stole."

"Stolen!" echoed the cashier. "That's unfortunate. Not so bad as it
might be, though. The thief can't collect the money."

"That's what I came to see about," said Dick. "I was afraid he might
have got it already."

"He hasn't been here yet. Even if he had, I remember you, and should
have detected him. When was it taken?"

"Yesterday," said Dick. "I missed it in the evenin' when I
got home."

"Have you any suspicion as to the person who took it?" asked
the cashier.

Dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and
suspicious conduct of Jim Travis, and the cashier agreed with him
that he was probably the thief. Dick also gave his reason for
thinking that he would visit the bank that morning, to withdraw
the funds.

"Very good," said the cashier. "We'll be ready for him. What is the
number of your book?"

"No. 5,678," said Dick.

"Now give me a little description of this Travis whom you suspect."

Dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of Travis, not
particularly complimentary to the latter.

"That will answer. I think I shall know him," said the cashier. "You
may depend upon it that he shall receive no money on your account."

"Thank you," said Dick.

Considerably relieved in mind, our hero turned towards the door,
thinking that there would be nothing gained by his remaining longer,
while he would of course lose time.

He had just reached the doors, which were of glass, when through
them he perceived James Travis himself just crossing the street, and
apparently coming towards the bank. It would not do, of course, for
him to be seen.

"Here he is," he exclaimed, hurrying back. "Can't you hide me
somewhere? I don't want to be seen."

The cashier understood at once how the land lay. He quickly opened a
little door, and admitted Dick behind the counter.

"Stoop down," he said, "so as not to be seen."

Dick had hardly done so when Jim Travis opened the outer door,
and, looking about him in a little uncertainty, walked up to the
cashier's desk.
