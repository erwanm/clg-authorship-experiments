worthy, with whatever discomfort of conscience, 
had had a high hand for affairs of profit and had 
flourished as the undoer of virtue or confidence 
or whatever other shaky equilibrium is often 
observed to flourish. The proofs of his mastery 
were naturally, however, much more evident to 
the followers in his line than any ground for im 
putations less flattering; with which it seemed 
further unmistakable that a posterity in such 
good humour with itself and its traditions might 
have even enough of that grace to spare for cases 
of the minor felicity. How at ?ny rate had it 
come about that the minor felicity, of all things 
in the world, could be a distinguishable mark of 
trie English Pendrels, the legend of any awkward 
accident or any foregone advantage in whose 
annals would so scantly have emerged as matter 
Tor free reference ? This was a question that 
might with the extraordinary swell of our young 
man's present vision find itself as answerable as 
the next before or the next after. Every ques 
tion became answerable, in its turn, the moment 
it was touched; so that when his companion, as 
she had so bravely become, mentioned the repair 
of the family breach he jumped at the occasion 
for a full illustration of the subject. 

"You see how little difference your mother's 
marriage made to us, with the extinction of our 
name here involved in it; since if Pendrels had 





  

at last failed us, for the pleasure over there of 
thinking of them, we could make Midmores 
answer almost as well at the worst take them 
up even with a resignation which, now that I 
know you, cousin," Ralph went on, "seems to 
put our acquaintance in a light that couldn't 
possibly be bettered." 

"Certainly the Midmores are as good as any 
body," the young lady bearing their name flared 
out in the charmingest way to reply; "for we're 
not forgetting, are we? that it was a Pendrel 
after all, one of yours, though of mamma's own 
recognised blood too, who came out as if on pur 
pose to make the trouble among us; the trouble 
we doubtless needn't go into again now, even if 
it seems to have been thought as ill as possible 
of at the time." 

"No, we needn't go into that of course," Ralph 
smiled smiled verily through his exhilarated 
sense that whereas the best of reasons for their 
not doing so would have dwelt a few moments 
before in his imperfect grasp of that affair, he 
now enjoyed the superior view of it as well be 
fore him and only a bit embarrassing to handle. 
"You didn't like us then, and we must have 
been brought up not greatly to like you all the 
more even, no doubt, if we were in the wrong," 
he cleverly put it; "so that things got worse, 
and we thought still more evil, on both sides, 
than there was to think; which perhaps didn't
