real duration, and I know what I mean when I 
say that everything altogether corresponds. Then 
it is, in the final situation, that we get, by a back 
ward reference or action, the real logic and process 
of the Ambassador's view of how it has seemed 
best to take the thing, and what it has seemed 
best to "do" in connection with his strange 
visitor's exhibition. He gives, he states, what 
has then determined and guided him; and I see 





  

that he states it to Aurora all sufficiently and 
vividly, so that we don't have any clumsiness of 
his going back to it, I mean to his account of 
his own procedure, with Ralph himself when we 
have Ralph at last restored and, as what all that 
has gone on in the interval makes it, saved: 
saved from all the horror of the growing fear 
of not being saved, of being lost, of being in the 
past to stay, heart-breakingly to stay and never 
know his own original precious Present again; 
that horror which his conception of his adventure 
had never reckoned with, and his manner of 
getting saved from which, saved by the sacrifice, 
the self-sacrifice of the creature to whom he con 
fesses, in his anguish of fear, the secret of who 
and what and how etc. he is, constitutes the 
clou and crisis and climax of my action as I see 
it. It will take more working out, which will 
come but too abundantly, I seem to apprehend, 
as I go; but I have the substance of it, I have 
that still, as I had it of old, in my vision, even if 
a trifle rough, of the two sisters, the mother, 
Mrs. So-and-so of Drydown, the brother of that 
period, and whoever or whatever else I may sub- 
ordinately need even to the point very possibly 
of a second young man, the third, that is, in all, 
who is a wooer or suitor of the younger sister 
and, for my full kind of quasi-Turn-of-Screw 
effect, is of a type, a type of the period, entirely 
opposed to that of the brother. I see him, I 





  

have him and his affair, too thoroughly to have 
to waste words on him here. The more I get 
into my drama itself the more magnificent, upon 
my word, I seem to see it and feel it; with such 
a tremendous lot of possibilities in it that I posi 
tively quake in dread of the muchness with which 
they threaten me. The slow growth on the part 
of the others of their fear of Ralph, even in the 
midst of their making much of him, as abnormal, 
as uncanny, as not like those they know of their 
own kind etc., etc.; and his fear just of theirs, 
with his double consciousness, alas, his being 
almost as right as possible for the "period," and 
yet so intimately and secretly wrong; with his 
desire to mitigate so far as he can the malaise 
that he feels himself, do what he will, more and 
more produce. There must be an importance for 
him, I mean about him, in the view of the others; 
and this must be definite and consist of some 
two or three very strong and vivid facts vivid 
that is to the imagination of people of 1820. 
Rather beautiful does it seem to me to have two 
or three of his actual modern facts stick to him 
and operate in this sense that I try to project : not 
ably his "refinement," though he tries to conceal 
it, to dissimulate it; notably his being in 1820 
as "rich" as he is, or was, in 1910 which counts
