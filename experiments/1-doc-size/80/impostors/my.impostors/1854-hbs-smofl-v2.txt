climate but a short time, and then they are obliged to go 
down and live in the valleys below, while others take their 
places. 

They told us that there were over a hundred people in 
the hospice when we were there. They wore mostly poor 
peasants and some beggars. One poor man came up to me, 
and uncovered his neck, which was a most disgusting sight, 
swollen with goitre. I shut my eyes, and turned another 
way, like a bad Christian, while our Augustine friend walked 
up to him. spoke in a soothing tone, and called him " my son." 
He seemed very loving and gentle to all the poor, dirty people 
by whom we were surrounded. 

I went into the chapel to look at the pictures. There was 
St. Bernard standing in the midst of a desolate, snowy waste, 
with a little child on one arm and a great dog beside him. 


This St. Bernard, it seem?, was a man of noble family, who 
lived nine hundred and sixty-two years after Christ. Almost 
up to that time a temple to Jupiter continued standing on 
this spot. It is said that the founding of this institution finally 
rooted out the idolatrous worship. 

On Monday we returned to Martagny, and obtained a 
voiture for Villeneuve. Drove through the beautiful Rhone 
valley, past the celebrated fall of the Pissevache, and about 
five o'clock reached the Hotel Byron, on the shore of the lake. 



 



LETTER XXXVII 

Hotel Byrox. 

My Dear: — 

Here I am, sitting &t my window, overlooking Lake Leman. Castle Chillon, with its old conical towers, is silently 
pictured in the still waters. It has been a day of a thousand. We took a boat, with two oarsmen, and passed 
leisurely along the shores, under the cool, drooping branches 
of trees, to the castle, which is 
scarce a stone's throw from the 
hotel. "We rowed along, close 
under the walls, to the ancient 
moat and drawbridge. There 
I picked a bunch of blue bells, 
" les clochettes," which were 
hanging their aerial pendants 
from every crevice — some 
blue, some white. 

I know not why the old 
buildings and walls in Europe 
have this vivacious habit of 
shooting out little flowery ejaculations and soliloquies at every 
turn. One sees it along through 
France and Switzerland, every 
where ; but never, that I remember, in America. 








On the side of the castle wall, in a large white heart, is 
painted the inscription, Liberte et Patrie! 

"We rowed along, almost touching the eastle rock, where 
the wall ascends perpendicularly, and the water is said to be 
a thousand feet deep. We passed the loopholes that illuminate the dungeon vaults, and an old arch, now walled up, 
where prisoners, after having been strangled, were thrown 
into the lake.
