you 've seen her ! They 're Southern people.'"' 

" Yes, that was obvious in her case." 

" From her accent ? Isn't it fascinating ? I didn't 
believe I could ever endure Southerners, but we 're 
like one family with the "Woodburns. I should 
think' you 'd want to paint Miss Yoodburn. Don't 
you think her colouring is delicious ? And such a 
quaint kind of eighteenth-century type of beauty ! 
But she's perfectly lovely every way, and every- 
thing she says is so funny. The Southerners seem 
to be such great talkers ; better than we are, don't 
you think ? " 

" I don't know," said Beaton, in pensive dis- 
couragement. He was sensiljle of being manipu- 
lated, operated, but he was helpless to escape from 
the performer or to fathom her motives. His 
pensiveness passed into gloom, and was degenerat- 
ing into sulky resentment when he went away, 
after several failures to get back to the old ground 
he had held in relation to Alma. He retrieved 
something of it with Mrs. Leighton; but Alma 
glittered upon him to the last with a keen impene- 
trable candour, a childlike singleness of glance, 
covering unfathomable reserve. 

" Well, Alma," said her mother, when the door 
had closed upon him. 

" Well, mother." Then, after a moment, she said, 
with a rush : " Did you think I was going to let him 




suppose we were piqued at his not corning'? Did 
you suppose I was going to let him patronise us, or 
think that we were in the least dependent on his 
favour or friendship ? " 

Ilcr mother did not attempt to answer her. She 
merely said, " I shouldn't think he would come any 
more." 

"Well, we have got on so far without him ; per- 
haps we can live through the rest of the winter." 

" I couldn't help feeling sorry for him. He was 
quite stupefied. I could see that he didn't know 
vv'hat to make of you." 

" He 's not required to make anything of me," 
said Alma. 

" Do you think he really believed you had for- 
gotten all those things ? " 

" Impossible to sa}', mamma." 

"Well, I don't think it was quite right, Alma." 

" I 'll leave him to you the next time. Miss 
Woodburn said you were freezing him to death 
when I came down." 

" That was quite different. But there won't be 
any next time, I 'm afraid," sighed Mrs. Leighton. 

Beaton went home feeling sure there would not. 
He tried to read when he got to his room ; but 
Alma's looks, tones, gestures, whirred through and 
through the woof of the story like shuttles ; he 
could not keep them out, and he fell asleep at last, 
not because he forgot them, but because he forgave 
them. He was able to say to himself that he had 
boen justly cut off from kindness M-liich l;e knew
