SOME hours had passed. The "first evening," 
the " evening between the evenings," and the ** sec- 
ond evening " were gone. It was midnight ; and he 
was at last alone. 

It had been a hard contest ; but he had conquered 
the people. This was a much more difficult thing 
to do as his throbbing heart and exhausted nerve 
told him than it had been for him to feed five 
thousand men on five loaves of bread. In the esti- 
mate of his strange power one must rank verj high 
among mystical gifts the art, the force, the wit, 
the will wHch peaceably dispersed the mob that 
night. 

The personal friends of Jesus, swept into the gen- 
eral excitement, were almost carried off their feet. 
They would have liked nothing better than to see 
their Rabbi with a crown on his dear head. They 
considered no throne too good for him. They would 
have headed the rioters with equal zeal and indiscre- 
tion; and might have been in a Roman dungeon 
before another sunset. Jesus found it as important 
to control them as to dismiss the multitude of men 
who had gone into such a frenzy over the events of 
this exciting day. 



A DECISIVE CRISIS 241 

To the dismay of the twelve they were ordered to 
take to their boat at once and sail away, and that with- 
out his company. This was confounding. What a 
disappointment ! Not to stay and see what was going 
to happen ? To leave the Eabbi alone with the mob ? 
To have no share in this tremendous thing? To be 
sent home like children who could not be trusted in 
great public affairs ? It was hard. But they obeyed 
him, for the* command was given in a certain tone of 
his, not too often used, but as irresistible as whirl- 
wind, torrent, conflagration, or any force of nature 
when it came. When Jesus spoke in this way, it no 
more occurred to his friends to withstand him than 
to defy Jehovah. They went. Uncomfortable and 
unhappy, they set sail without him, and headed for 
the western shore of the lake. 

Jesus was now left* quite alone upon the plain of 
Batihah. He climbed to its highest hillock and 
sank, for he was worn out, upon the ground. 

He recognized perfectly that the crisis of his life 
had come. It was all in his own hands now, 
rather it was aE in his own heart. It was his to 
choose between glory and shame, between success 
and failure. Strictly speaking, it was not a choice 
between life and death. In either event, he stood 
but scant chance of life. An ordinary man would 
have been blinded by his position. A. demagogue 
would have suffered himself to be carried on the 
shoulders of the people into the maddest and great- 
est of Hebrew insurrections. The duller zealot, 
meaning generously, but thinking imperfectly, would 
have rushed headlong and tried to retreat too late; 



242 THE STORY OF JESUS CHBIST 

The trap would shut down on leader and on people 
alike; and it would snap with a Roman lock. 

Jesus recognized the fact that he lived in a time 
of anarchy and under an iron autocracy. From five 
million Jews Herod the Great had exacted three 
millions of dollars a year, a heavy tax for the 
average income. Desperate poverty filled the land 
which it stirred to perpetual revolt. The people
