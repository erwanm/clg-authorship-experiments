makes it so delightful.  No other people could have invented it, and it
doesn’t try to be anything but what we made it.”

“I’m so glad you look at it in that way.  We like it.  We discovered it
three or four years ago, and we never let a summer slip, if we can help
it, without coming here for a week or a month.  The place,” I enlarged,
“has the charm of ruin, though it’s in such obvious repair; it has a
past; it’s so completely gone by in a society sense.  The cottage life
here hasn’t killed the hotel life, as it has at Newport and Bar Harbour;
but the ideal of cottage life everywhere else has made hotel life at
Saratoga ungenteel.  The hotels are full, but at the same time they are
society solitudes.”

“How gay it is!” said the young fellow, as he gazed with a pensive smile
into the street, where all those festive vehicles were coming and going,
dappled by the leaf-shadows from the tall trees overhead.  “What air!
what a sky!”  The one was indeed sparkling, and the other without a
cloud, for it had rained in the night, and it seemed as if the weather
could never be hot and close again.

I forgot how I had been sweltering about, and said: “Yes; it is a
Saratoga day.  It’s supposed that the sparkle of the air comes from the
healthful gases thrown off by the springs.  Some people say the springs
are doctored; that’s what makes their gases so healthful.”

“Why, anything might happen here,” Kendricks mused, unheedful of me.
“What a scene! what a stage!  Why has nobody done a story about
Saratoga?” he asked, with a literary turn I knew his thoughts would be
taking.  All Gerald Kendricks’s thoughts were of literature, but
sometimes they were not of immediate literary effect, though that was
never for long.

“Because,” I suggested, “one probably couldn’t get his young lady
characters to come here if they were at all in society.  But of course
there must be charming presences here accidentally.  Some young girl,
say, might come here from a country place, expecting to see social
gaiety—”

“Ah, but that would be too heart-breaking!”

“Not at all.  Not if she met some young fellow accidentally—don’t you
see?”

“It would be difficult to manage; and hasn’t it been done?”

“Everything has been done, my dear fellow.  Or, you might suppose a young
lady who comes on here with her father, a veteran politician, delegate to
the Republican or Democratic convention—all the conventions meet in
Saratoga,—and some ardent young delegate falls in love with her.  That
would be new ground.  There you would have the political novel, which
they wonder every now and then some of us don’t write.”  The smile faded
from Kendricks’s lips, and I laughed.  “Well, then, there’s nothing for
it but the Social Science Congress.  Have a brilliant professor win the
heart of a lovely sister-in-law of another member by a paper he reads
before the Congress.  No?  You’re difficult.  Are you stopping here?”

“Yes; are you?”

“I try to give myself the air of it when I am feeling very proud.  But
really, we live at a most charming little hotel on a back street, out of
the whirl and rush that we should prefer to be in if we could afford it.”
He said it must be delightful, and he made the proper inquiries about
Mrs. March.  Kendricks never forgot the gentleman in the artist, and he
was as true to the convenances as if they had been principles.  That
was what made Mrs. March like his stories so much more than the stories
of some people who wrote better.  He said he would drop in during the
afternoon, and I went indoors on the pretext of buying a newspaper.
Then, without engaging rooms for Mrs. Deering and Miss Gage, I hurried
home.

“WELL, did you get the rooms?” asked my wife as soon as she saw me.

She did not quite call it across the street to me as I came up from where
she sat on the piazza.
