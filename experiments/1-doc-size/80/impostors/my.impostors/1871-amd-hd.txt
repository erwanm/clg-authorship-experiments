The door was opened slightly. 

" Would Miss Alston please to walk up stairs ? 
Miss Ada had a headache, and couldn't come down." 

" Katy, how many times have I told you not to 
open a door without knocking ! " exclaimed Mrs. 
Meredith, angrily. " You never can beat anything 
into their stupid brains." 

Indignant Katy slammed the door in much the 
same temper as her mistress. Then she was sum- 
moned again, and commanded to show the visitor to 
Miss Ada's room. 

She only went as far as the nursery door. " It is 
the front room up stairs," she said, sullenly. 

Kathie found it by herself, and tapped lightly. 

" Come," answered a faint voice. 

Kathie entered the room like a radiant little pic- 
ture. Her wine-colored suit, ermine muff and tippet, 
and white felt hat trimmed with velvet and feather 
the shade of her dress, were indescribably pretty and 



 

becoming. Her loose light curls were gathered in a 
knot at the back, with a few stray shorter ones around 
her face. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks blooming 
with a soft, peachy tint, and her skin pearly clear. 
A very pretty girl indeed ; but sweetest of all was 
the earnest, tender, soulful expression. Yet Ada was 
absolutely filled with envy, glad as she was to see 
her. 

The furniture and appointments of the room were 
pretty enough, but it had a comfortless look. The 
remnant of yesterday's fire was in the grate, while 
the fender was filled with ashes and bits of torn 
paper. The closet door was open, betraying the dis- 
order within. Over the cushioned easy-chair was 
thrown yesterday's dress and skirt, and at a little 
distance stood her walking-boots. The top of the 
bureau was in the utmost disorder. Collars, hand- 
kerchiefs, ribbons, and a plate of breakfast fragments, 
while from the side of the glass depended a net, a 
braid of hair, and two straggling, fuzzy curls. How 
different from the elegance in which Ada used to 
pride herself ! 

The girls kissed in unaffected cordiality. Kathie's 
generous heart was full of tenderest pity, the noble 



 

kind that wounds not by pretentious showing, and 
anything so warm and bright seemed grateful to Ada 
just then. 

" I am sorry to find you ill," Kathie said, gently. 

" I have such wretched headaches ! And the house 
has been as cold as a barn all the morning. Katy 
has not found time to make up my fire yet, nor put 
my room in order. How dreadful it looks ! Can you 
find a chair ? ' : Ada was wrapped in a shawl and 
pillowed up in bed. She glanced around in dismay. 

" Never mind," returned Kathie, pleasantly. " I 
am used to helping myself." 

" How well you do look ! It isn't strictly aristo-
