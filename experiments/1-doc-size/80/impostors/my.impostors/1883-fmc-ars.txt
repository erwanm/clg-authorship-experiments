as you say." So we were both satisfied.

The storm of the night had passed away, leaving 
everything wet and the air cool and fresh. I wrapped 
my cloak about me, and went into the market-place, 
to see if I could pick up any news. It was already 
late, for the country, and there were few people 
about. Here and there, in the streets, a wine-cart 
was halting on its way to Rome, while the rough 
carter went through the usual arrangement of ex 
changing some of his employer's wine for food for 
himself, filling up the barrel with good pure water, 
which never hurt any one. I wandered about, though 
I could not expect to see any face that I knew ; it is 
so many years since I lived at Serveti, that even were 
the carters from my old place, I should have forgotten 
how they looked. Suddenly, at the corner of a dirty 
street, where there was a little blue and white shrine 
to the Madonna, I stumbled against a burly fellow 
with a grey beard, carrying a bit of salt codfish in 
one hand and a cake of corn bread in the other, eating as he went. 

" Gigi ! " I cried in delight, when I recognised the 
old carrettiere who used to bring me grapes and wine, 
and still does when the fancy takes him. 

" Dio mio ! Signor Conte ! " he cried with his 
mouth full, and holding up the bread and fish with 
his two hands, in astonishment. When he recovered 
himself, he instantly offered to share his meal with 
me, as the poorest wretch in Italy will offer his crust 



 

to the greatest prince, out of politeness. " Vuol 
favorire ? " he asked, smiling, 

I thanked him and declined, as you may imagine. 
Then I asked him how he came to be in Palestrina ; 
and he told me that he was often there in the winter, 
as his sister had married a vine-dresser of the place, 
of whom he bought wine occasionally. Very well-to- 
do people, he explained eagerly, proud of his pros 
perous relations. 

We clambered along together through the rough 
street, and I asked him the news from Serveti and 
from that part of the country, well knowing that if 
he had heard of any rich foreigners in that neighbour 
hood he would at once tell me of it. But I had not 
much hope. He talked about the prospects of the 
vines, and such things, for some time, and I listened 
patiently. 

" By the bye," he ^aid at last, " there is a gran 
signore who is gone to live in Fillettino, a crazy 
man, they say, with a beautiful daughter, but really 
beautiful, as an angel." 

I was so much surprised that I made a loud ex 
clamation. 

" What is the matter ? " asked Gigi. 

" It is nothing. Gigi," I answered, for I was afraid 
lest he should betray my secret, if I let him guess it. 
"It is nothing  
But you were celling about a foreigner who is gone 
to live somewhere. Fillettino? Where is that?" 

" Oh, the place of the diavolo ! I do not wonder 
you do not know, conte, for gentlemen never go 
there. It is in the Abruzzi, beyond Trevi. Did you
