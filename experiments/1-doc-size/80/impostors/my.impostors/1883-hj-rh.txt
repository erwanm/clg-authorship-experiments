inscrutable smile. "Eh, dear signore, the Christina is 
very romantic ! " 

" So much so, you intimate, that she will eventually 
pivot round in consequence not of a change of sentiment, 
but of a mysterious outward pressure?" 

" If everything else fails, there is that resource. But it 
is mysterious, as you say, and you needn't try to guess 
it. You will never know." 

"The poor signorina, then, will suffer !" 

"Not too much, I hope." 

"And the remarkable young man? You maintain 
that there is nothing but disappointment in store for the 
infatuated youth who loses his heart to her." 

The Cavaliere hesitated. "He had better," he said 
in a moment, "go and pursue his studies in Florence. 
There are very fine antiques in the Uffizi !" 

Rowland presently joined Mrs. Light, to whom her 
restless portege had not yet returned. "That 's right," 
she said ; "sit down here j I have something serious to 
say to you. I am going to talk to you as a friend. I 
want your assistance. In fact, you must help me ; it 's 
your duty. Look at that unhappy young man." 

"Yes," said Rowland, "he seems unhappy." 

" He is just come of age, he bears one of the greatest 
names in Italy, and owns one of the greatest properties, 
and he is pining away with love for my daughter." 

"So the Cavaliere tells me." 

" The Cavaliere shouldn't gossip," said Mrs. Light, 
drily. " Such information should come from me. The 
Prince is pining, as I say ; he 's consumed, he 's devoured. 
It 's a real Italian passion ; I know what that means !" 
And the lady gave a speaking glance, which seemed to 
coquet for a moment with retrospect. " Meanwhile, if 
you please, my daughter is hiding in the woods with your 
dear friend Mr. Hudson. I could cry with rage ! " 

"If things are as bad as that," said Rowland, "it 
seems to me that you should find nothing easier than 



 

to despatch the Cavaliere to bring the guilty couple 
back." 

" Never in the world ! My hands are tied. Do you 
know what Christina would do? She would tell the 
Cavaliere to go about his business Heaven forgive her ! 
and send me word that if she had a mind to she would 
walk in the woods till midnight. Fancy the Cavaliere 
coming back and delivering such a message as that before 
the Prince ! Think of a girl wantonly making light of 
such a chance as hers ! He would marry her to-morrow 
at six o clock in the morning." 

" It is certainly very sad," said Rowland. 

"That costs you little to say ! If you had left your 
precious young meddler to vegetate in his native village 
you would have saved me a world of bother ! " 

"Ah, you marched into the jaws of danger," said 
Rowland. "You came and knocked at poor Hudson 's 
door. " 

"In an evil hour ! I wish to Heaven you would talk 
with him."
