dispute, Jack went back to his habits with the ferocity 
that follows abstinence. Hard luck came. Teen was 
never much of a housekeeper ; she had left her mother 
too early ; had never been taught. Things were soggy, 
and not always clean ; and she was so busy in being 
struck and scolded, and in bearing and burying babies, 
that it grew comfortless beside the kitchen fire. The 
last of the illusions which had taken the name of home 
within the walls of the crumbling half-cottage withered 
out of it, just as the cinnamon roses did the summer 
Jack watered them with whiskey by a little emotional 
mistake. 

A worse thing had happened too. Some shipmate 
had " told " in the course of time ; and Teen's 
prematrimonial story got set adrift upon the current — 
one of the crudest currents of its kind — of Fairharbor 
gossip. The respectable neighbors made her feel it, as 
only respectable neighbors do such things. Jack, raging, 
overheard her name upon the wharves. Teen had 
been "that she said she would" to him. He knew it. 
No matron in the town had kept her life or heart more 




true. In all her sickness and trouble and slackness, and 
in going cold or hungry, and in her vivid beauty that 
none or all of these things could quench, Teen had carried
a sweet dignity of her own as the racer in the old 
Promethean festival carried the torch while he ran 




against the wind. Jack knew, — oh yes, he knew. 
But he grew sullen, suspicious. When he was drunk 
he was always jealous ; it began to take that form. 
When he was sober he still admired his wife ; sometimes
he went so far as to remember that he loved her.
When this happened, Teen dried her eyes, and brushed 
her yellow hair, and washed up the kitchen floor, and 
made the coffee, and said to the grocer when she paid 
for the sugar : 

"My husband has reformed." 

One night Jack came home unexpectedly ; a strange 
mood sat upon him, which his wife did not find herself 
able to classify by any of the instant and exquisite 
perceptions which grow, like new faculties, in wives. He 
had been drinking heavily when he left her, and she had 
not looked for him for days ; if he sailed as he was, it 
would be a matter of weeks. Teen went straight to 
him ; she thought he might be hurt ; she held out her 
arms as she would to one of her children ; but he met 
her with a gesture of indifference, and she shrank back. 

"She's here," said Jack. " Mother Mary 's in this 
d town. I see her." 

"I wish she'd talk to you," said Teen, saying pre- 
cisely the wrong thing by the fatal instinct which so 
often possesses drunkards' wives. 

" You do, do you ? " quoth Jack. " Well, I don't. I 
haven't give her the chance." He crushed on his hat 
and stole out of the house again. 

But his mood was on him yet ; the difference being 
that his wife was out of it. He sulked and skulked 
about the streets alone for a while ; he did not go back 
to the boys just then, but wandered with the apparent 
aimlessness in which the most tenacious aims are 


hidden. Mother Mary and her husband were holding 
sailors' meetings in the roughest quarter of the town. 
There was need enough of Mother Mary in Fairharbor. 
A crowd had gathered to hear the novelty. Fairharbor
