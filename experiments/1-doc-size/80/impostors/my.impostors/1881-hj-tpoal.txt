" It is very pretty, papa. Did you make it yourself ? " 



 

" Yes, my child ; I made it. Don't you think I am clever ? " 

" Yes, papa, very clever ; I also have learned to make pic- 
tures." And she turned round and showed a small, fair face, of 
which the natural and usual expression seemed to be a smile of 
perfect sweetness. 

"You should have brought me a specimen of your powers." 

" I have brought a great many ; they are in my trunk," said 
the child. 

" She draws very very carefully," the elder of the nuns 
remarked, speaking in French. 

" I am glad to hear it. Is it you who have instructed her? " 

" Happily, no," said the good sister, blushing a little. " Ce 
n'est pas ma partie. I teach nothing ; I leave that to those who 
are wiser. We have an excellent drawing-master, Mr. Mr. 
what is his name? " she asked of her companion. 

Her companion looked about at the carpet. 

" It's a German name," she said in Italian, as if it needed to 
be translated. 

" Yes," the other went on, " he is a German, and we have had 
him for many years." 

The young girl, who was not heeding the conversation, had 
wandered away to the open door of the large room, and stood 
looking into the garden. 

" And you, my sister, are French," said the gentleman. 

" Yes, sir," the woman replied, gently. " I speak to the pupils 
in my own language. I know no other. But we have sisters of 
other countries English, German, Irish. They all speak their 
own tongue." 

The gentleman gave a smile. 

" Has my daughter been under the care of one of the Irish 
ladies'? " And then, as he saw that his visitors suspected a joke, 
but failed to understand it " You are very complete," he said, 
instantly. 

" Oh, yes, we are complete. We have everything, and every- 
thing is of the best." 

" We have gymnastics," the Italian sister ventured to remark. 
" But not dangerous." 

" I hope not. Is that your branch ? " A question which 
provoked much candid hilarity on the part of the two ladies ; on 
the subsidence of which their entertainer, glancing at his daughter, 
remarked that she had grown. 

" Yes, but I think she has finished. She will remain little,' 
said the French sister. 

" I am not sorry. I like little women," the gentleman declared, 



 

frankly. "But I know no particular reason why my child 
should be short." 

The nun gave a temperate shrug, as if to intimate that such 
things might be beyond our knowledge.
