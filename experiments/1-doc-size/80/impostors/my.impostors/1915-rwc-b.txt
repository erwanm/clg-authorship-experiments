clips. 

"You will not require it this afternoon?" 
she asked. 

"No fear. You won't either. Them mule- 
whacking coons is white." 

She understood. 

"Some men who seem whitest are blacker 
than any negro," she remarked. "Eh, bien! 
I thank you, Keed, mon ami, for your com 
plaisance. You are very amiable to submit to 
the whim of a silly girl who suddenly becomes 
afraid of her own shadow." 

Glenn grinned and glanced significantly at 
the cross dangling from her bosom: 

"Sure," he said, "your government decorates 









cowards. That's why it gave you the Legion." 
She blushed but looked up at him seriously: 
"Keed, if I flew a little toy balloon in the 
air, where would the west wind carry it?" 

"Into the Boche trenches," he replied, much

we'll paint "To hell with Willie on it and set 
it afloat! But we'll have to get permission 
from the gendarmes first." 
She said, smiling: 

"I'm sorry, but I haven't any toy balloons."

head, ignoring his offered assistance, gave him 
a beguiling glance, and went away along the 
sheep-path. 

Once more she followed the deep-trodden and 
ancient trail through copse and pasture and 
over the stream down into the meadow, where 
the west wind furrowed the wild-flowers and 
the early afternoon sun fell hot. 

She set her clothes to soak, laid paddle 
and soap beside them, then, straightening up, 
remained erect on her knees, her intent gaze 
fixed on the distant clump of aspens, delicate 





 



as inist above the hazel copse on the little 
hill beyond. 

It was a whole hour before her eyes caught 
the high glimmer of a tiny balloon. Only 
for a moment was it visible at that distance, 
then it became merged in the dazzling blue 
above the woods. 

She waited. At last she concluded that there 
were to be no more balloons. Then a sudden 
fear assailed her lest she had waited too long
