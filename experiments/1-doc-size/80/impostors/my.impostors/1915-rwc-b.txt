above the hazel. 

She could see nobody, hear not a sound from 
the thicket on the little hill. But another bub 
ble rose above the aspens as she looked. 

Naked, she dared not advance into the woods 
scarcely dared linger where she was, yet 
found enough courage to creep out on a car 
pet of moss and lie flat Tinder a young fir, 
listening and watching. 

No more bubbles rose above the aspens; 
there was not a sound, not a movement in the 
hazel. 

For an hour or more she lay there; then, 
with infinite caution, she slipped back into the 
stream, waded across, crept into the meadow, 
and sped like a scared fawn along the bank 
until she stood panting by the stone-rimmed 
pool again. 

Sun and wind had dried her skin; she 
dressed rapidly, swung her basket to her head, 
and started swiftly for Sainte Lesse. 

Before she came in sight of the White Doe 
Tavern, she could hear the negro muleteers 
singing down by the corral. 









Sticky Smith still squatted in the garden 
by the river-wall, smoking his pipe. Her fa 
ther lay asleep in his chair, his wrinkled hands 
still clasping the fishing pole, the warm breeze 
blowing his white hair at the temples. 

She disposed of the wash; then she and 
Sticky Smith gently aroused the crippled bell- 
master and aided him into the house. 

The old peasant woman who cooked for the 
inn had soup ready. The noonday meal in 
Sainte Lesse had become an extremely simple 
affair. 

"Monsieur Steek," said the girl carelessly, 
"did you ever, as a child, fly toy balloons?" 

"Sure, Maryette. A old Eyetalian wop used 
to come round town selling them. He had a 
stick with about a hundred little balloons tied 
to it red, blue, green, yellow all kinds and 
colours. Whenever I had the price I bought 
one." 

"Did it fly?" 

"Yes. The gas in it wasn't much good unless 
you got a fresh one." 

"Would it fly high?"
