" Don't you feel it beat ? " 

"No!" 

"What!" And Mrs. Harte thrust her hand in, 
pushing that of Mr. Guy aside. Suspended breaths 
marked the intense interest of both. " It beats, sir ! 
There ! Put your hand there ! " She spoke in a whisper, 
quickly. 

" Yes yes. I feel it ! But how very low and 
faint," said Guy, as he withdrew his hand and stood 
up, in doubt and irresolution. Then he laid his fingers 
again over the artery on her wrist. Not the feeblest 
thread of motion touched the alert sense of feeling:.

" You gave her too much, I fear," said Mrs. Harte, 
letting her pale, blue eyes rest firmly upon him. 

The face of Mr. Guy turned still whiter.

" There has been an over dose,'' she said, confidently. 
" I'm afraid you mistook the amount of vital power in 
her system." 

" If there has been a mistake, it lies at the Doctor's 
door, not mine," answered Guy, in too apparent alarm. 

"No dose is marked on the label." The woman's 
eyes turned from the vial, and again dwelt, searchingly, 
on Guy's face. He quailed a little, and she saw it. 

" I think," said Mrs. Harte, speaking with delibera
