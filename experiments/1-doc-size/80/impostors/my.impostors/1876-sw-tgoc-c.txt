The afternoon was waning, though evening had not yet set in, 
when the door opened gently and Primrose Maryland appeared. 
Gyda's finger at her lips stayed all but softly uttered words, till 
Primrose came up to the fire and looked at the sleeper in the 
cushioned chair.

Prim looked, and looked away. Her movement first was to go to 
the table and take off her bonnet and lay down her shawl and right 
herself a little. Yet Prim was nothing of a coquette, not the least in 
the world, and never thought about her dress but to have it 
respectable. Neither did she think about it now; for there was no 
glass in the room, and the movement with which she pushed the 
hair further back from her brow assuredly had no origin in regard 
to appearances. However she came back after that and looked at 
Hazel more steadily, and then sat down by Mrs. BoÃ«rresen to talk 
in a soft undertone which could disturb nobody. The two girls had 
scarcely seen each other since the fall before, except in the most 
casual manner at church or in some chance meeting. Hazel had had 
good reasons for keeping herself out of the way, and when they 
met had wrapped herself in a triple veil of defences; so that it was 
rather a revelation to see her as she looked now. A tired child 
asleep, instead of the energetic lady of Chickaree. Her three days' 
slumber had but partially done their work, and Hazel slept on now 
in the profoundest way; her face and hands in rather noticeable 
acceptance of the gray shawl, considering whose it was. Prim 
looked, and looked, from time to time in the intervals of talking, 
until the talking seemed to die away; and she sat drawn back into 
herself. The light was failing now. Gyda mended her fire again, 
and the heavy iron tongs slipped from her hands and fell with a 
harsh clang upon the hearth. Wych Hazel awoke.

The greeting then was very affectionate.

'Wherever in the world did you come from?' said Hazel. 'Does it 
take two people to keep watch of me?'

'I came here to be out of the way,' said Prim. 'Dane wanted Arthur, 
or at least the hurt man wanted him. What in the world are you 
here for, Hazel?'

'O I have been inspecting the mills,' said Hazel with a laugh; 'and 
of course after such profound work I was tired. But I did not mean 
to go to sleep. Has everybody else gone home?it is dinner time 
this minute.'

'Nobody has gone home,' said Primrose; 'and they cannot help 
about it's being dinner time, you know. Were you ever here 
before?in this house, I mean.'

'YesO,' said Hazel with sudden recollection, 'has it taken all this 
time to attend to that man?'

'Arthur is there.'

'Is he?that is good. But all this time!'with a shiver. 'I do not 
see how I could sleep!'She stood looking grave, as if rather 
disappointed in herself.

'Yes,' Primrose went on, 'Arthur and I were driving through the 
Hollow, just to see the things; and Dane laid hold of Arthur and 
sent me up here. He didn't tell me I should find you.' Primrose 
paused, as her eye fell on Hazel's cushioned and draperied chair. 
'You have changed your mind about Dane, haven't you Hazel?' she 
asked abruptly. Hazel faced round upon her in undoubted surprise.

'Changed my mind!' she repeated, flushing all up,'what was my 
mind?'

'You rememberlast year.'

'What about last year?'

'Why you remember, Hazel. You did not like him at all, and used 
to get out of all patience with him.'

'Of course I did. There is no particular call to get out of patience 
just now. And even I generally wait for a reason.'

'Have you made up your mind you will never get out of patience 
again?' Prim asked, with a keen look to the answer.
