identification,"--abruptly leaving me.

Thunderbolts out of heaven!  My knees and collar bothered me again; the
first attack was trifling compared to this second seizure.  How the
devil was I to get out?

"Are you searching for me?" inquired a soft voice at my elbow.

I turned instantly.  The Blue Domino had come back to me.

"I have been searching for you everywhere," I said gallantly.

"Oh!  but that is a black one.  Never mind; the fib was well meant."

I led her over to a secluded nook, within a few feet of the door which
gave entrance to the club cellars.  This door I had been bearing in
mind for some time.  It is well to know your topography.  The door was
at the left of the band platform.  There was a twin-door on the other
side.  We sat down.



"Have you heard the news?" I asked.

"No.  Has some one been discovered making love to his own wife by
mistake?"

"It's serious.  Anne of Austria and Queen Elizabeth have been robbed of
some jewels."

"A thief among us?"

"A regular Galloping Dick.  I'm a thief myself, for that matter."

"You?" she drew away from me a bit.

"Yes.  My name is Procrastination."

"Ah, my grave Capuchin, we do not steal time; we merely waste it.  But

It is true I might hie me to the cellars; but how to get out of the
cellars!)  "Have you seen Julius Caesar?" I asked.

"Caesar?"

"Yes, Miss Hawthorne--"

The Blue Domino swung about and leaned toward me, her hands tense upon
the sides of her chair.

"What name did you say?"--a strained note in her voice.

"Hawthorne," I answered, taking out the slip of pasteboard.  "See! it
says that one blue domino was rented of Monsieur Friard at five-thirty
this afternoon."

"How did you come by that ticket?" she demanded.

"It was a miracle.  I purchased a mask there, and this ticket was
wrapped up in my bundle by mistake."

"It is a curious coincidence,"--her voice normal and unagitated.

I was confused.  "Then I am mistaken?"--my chagrin evident.  (All this
while, mind you, I was wondering if that cellar-door was unlocked, and
how long it would take me to reach it before the d√©nouement!)

"One way or the other, it does not matter," said she.

"Yet, if I could reach the cellars,"--absently.  Then I bit my tongue.

"Cellars?  Who said anything about cellars?  I meant that this is not
