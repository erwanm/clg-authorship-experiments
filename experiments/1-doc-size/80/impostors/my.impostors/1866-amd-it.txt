I see thee sitting crowned with good, 
A central warmth diffusing bliss 
In glance and smile, and clasp and kiss, 

On all the branches of thy blood. 
 

Out of the day and night 
A joy has taken its flight.  

" IT'S all settled, then, Richard ? " 

" With your approval, yes. Ada liked the plan as much 
as I did. She was disappointed at not going to Europe last 
year with her uncle." 

" But she will enjoy it better, now, eh ? " and Dr. Bertrand 
looked up with a roguish twinkle in his merry hazel eye. 
" Well, you must not devote all your time to love ; use your 
eyes and ears to some purpose, and come back with increased 
wisdom and experience. A young man may gain many a 
useful hint from those London and Paris physicians. And, 
Dick " 

Dr. Bertrand's pause was so long that Richard turned 
around, and found his father's eyes fixed steadily on the 
carpet. Presently he began: 



"I was about to remark, Dick, that Ada's fortune has 
been attended to. I suppose it is all settled on herself? " 

A warm color flushed the young man's face as he an- 
swered, " Yes, I insisted upon her retaining undisputed 
possession of it, although she thought it unnecessary." 

" Right. I want no one to call Dr. Bertrand's son a fortune-hunter. I've arranged yours so there'll be no trouble. 
Marchand & Co. will attend to it here and at Paris. Don't 
give yourself a moment's uneasiness for the next two years. 
When you return, I shall divide my practice ; it's too large 
for me now. I want to make a little money for the other 
children, and then " 

" We shall all be grown up and settled around you, striving to make you the happiest of fathers." 

" A long while to look forward," Dr. Bertrand exclaimed, 
musingly. " In any event, Dick, you will have the consolation that you have been a dutiful son a comfort and a 
blessing. You'll remember this if you should come back, 
and " 

" Don't," interrupted Richard, suddenly. 

Dr. Bertrand laughed, raised himself to his full height, 
swelled out his broad chest by a deep inspiration, and 
brought his fat, dimpled hand down on his son's shoulder. 
" No," he said, laughingly ; " I don't look much like ' the 
retired physician whose sands of life have nearly run out ; ' 
yet the Master warned us always to be ready. Twenty-six 
years ago ! I was thinking it over just as you came in : 
how happy we were that night, she singing those sweet 
old Scotch ballads until the room rang with her melody, 
and how I picked her up in my arms, and carried her off to 
her room ; yet before dawn she had kissed me for the last 
time, and gone home with the angels. But God has recon- 
ciled me to it through my boy's unselfish affection, and his 
high, unerring sense of honor. You have never cost me an 
hour's anxiety, Richard : you have been kind and obedient to 
her who took your mother's place, and a fond brother to the 

rest. In the new life opening before you, though you'll 
never forget us, another is to share your love ; children will 
grow up around you, increasing your cares and interest; 
and God grant they may be as faithful to you as you have 
been to me." 

Dr. Bertrand resumed his seat, and leaned his head on 
his hand, while there fell between them a deep and touching 
silence, broken at length by Richard, who said, in a full, ten-
