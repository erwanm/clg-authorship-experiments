better." 

I went briefly over the succeeding years my school 
life, my introduction to the world, my subsequent loss of 
fortune, and the years since, with their varied incidents. 

He had grown strangely interested. Through the latter 
part his eyes had scarcely wandered from my face. I 
marvelled that I should be able to talk with so little re- 
serve, but I could see that it pleased him better. Every 
moment a strong, yearning sympathy drew me nearer to 
him. 

"My poor child! If I could have known of your ex- 
istence years ago, Heaven will bear me witness that I 
would have given you the tenderest care. It was I who 



 

visited your aunt, and she told me you were dead. I 
might have made inquiries elsewhere, but I could riot sus- 
pect her of any motive for deception, though I could see 
that she cherished the most bitter hatred towards your 
father, even in his grave. Both of us sinned in our self- 
ish love for the one nearest to us. Can it ever be for- 
given ? " 

A strong impulse led me to clasp my hand over the 
thin white fingers. It was returned with trembling pres- 
sure. 

" I must go back to my own early life to make you un- 
derstand why I loved your father so well. There were 
two brothers of us, all that were left of a large family. 
Arnold and I were inseparable, and yet we were very dis- 
similar. He had a girl's delicacy and fastidiousness, while 
I was a great strong fellow, able to take life at its hardest 
or its worst. Why linger*'over that episode? We both 
loved the same woman, or rather child, a girl so fair, so 
pure and lovely in soul as well as in body, that all other 
women failed by comparison. I fancied she loved me in 
return ; and I watched with keenest eyes, quickened, per- 
haps, by all I had at stake. With Arnold she was shy 
and reserved, I thought, shunned rather than sought him, 
while she caine to me with so winsome a freedom that I 
laid my whole soul at her feet. Blind dolt that I was, not 
to see ! feut my passion absorbed sight and sense. One 
night Arnold came to me, his face fairly transfigured with 
delight, and his voice tremulous with joy. Muriel loved 
him, had confessed it, and promised to become his wife. 
In that moment I was plunged into the blackness and 
depth of despair. I could have cried out weakly in my 
agony, but for his sake I held my peace. But the torture 
of the next few weeks I cannot describe. Even now it 
comes back fresh and poignant. Muriel was so uncon- 



 

sciously sweet and sisterly. I knew then that my own 
blindness had misled me." 

He made so long a pause that I looked at him in distress. 
Each respiration was labored and painful. 

"You will injure yourself," I exclaimed, apprehen- 
sively. 

"I have lived these scenes over continually during the 
last twenty-four hours. Life is nearly gone what does 
it matter ? " 

What could I say ? I cast about for some comfort, but 
none came. 

" I could not stay to see them married. I happened to 
meet with a fine opening in a mercantile house connected
