'If you will stay with me, you shall see that evil is not far off,' he
answered, for she had reminded him of what he was expecting, and he knew
that it was no jesting matter. 'But you shall please yourself in this as
in all other matters, though it were better for you to go now and shut
yourself up in an inner room and wait for the end. The night is
advancing, and all will soon be over.'

'Hear me, Khaled,' said Zehowah, speaking earnestly. 'If you bid me go,
I will go, or if you desire me to stay, I will remain with you. But if
you are indeed in danger, as you say, let us call up the guards and the
watchmen who sleep in the palace, that they may stand by you with their
swords and help you to fight if there is to be strife.'

'I will have no treacherous fellows about me,' Khaled answered, 'and
there are none here whom I can trust. My hour is coming and I will
fight this fight alone. But if you were such as I once hoped, I would
say: "Remain with me, so long as you are safe." Now, since Allah has
willed it thus, I say to you: "Go and seek safety where you can find
it." Go, therefore, Zehowah, and leave me alone, for I need no one
beside me, and you least of all.'

He turned away his head, lest she should see his face, and with his hand
made a gesture bidding her to leave him. She rose from her seat softly
and hung the barbat upon the wall with the other musical instruments,
looking over her shoulder to see whether he would call her back. But he
neither moved nor spoke, being resolved to venture all upon this trial,
for he knew that if she loved him even but a little, she would not leave
him alone in the extremity of danger.

Then she went towards the door of the room, turning her head to look at
him as she passed near him.

'Farewell,' she said. But he did not answer nor show that he heard her
voice.

As she lifted the curtain to go out, she lingered and gazed at him. He
sat motionless upon the carpet, upright against the wall, his sword
lying across his feet, his hands hidden under his sleeves, looking
towards her indeed but not seeming to see her.

'There can be no real danger,' she thought. 'Could any man sit thus,
expecting death, and refusing to let any one stand by him to fight with
him? Surely, he is playing with me, and setting a trap for me. But he
shall not catch me.'

She turned to go and the curtain was falling behind her when the night
wind from the open passage brought a sound to her ears from a far
distance. She started and listened, as camels do when they hear the
first moving of the hot wind. There were no voices in the noise, which
was low and dull, like the breathing of a great multitude and the soft
moving of feet, and altogether it was as the slow rising and falling
back of the sea upon the shores of Oman, when the great summer storm is
coming from the south-west.

Zehowah stood still a moment and drank in every murmur that reached her
from without. Then her face grew white and her lips trembled when she
thought of Khaled sitting alone on the other side of the curtain, with
his sword upon his feet, waiting for the end. She lifted the hanging a
little and looked at him again. He saw her, but made no sign. Even as
she looked, the distant murmur grew louder and she fancied that he moved
his head as though he heard it. Then she entered the room and came and
stood before him.

'There is a great multitude in the square before the palace,' she said.

'I know it,' he answered, calmly looking up to her face. 'It needed not
that you should tell me.'

'Will you not let me stay with you now?' asked Zehowah.

'Why should you stay here?' he asked with a pretence of indifference.
'Of what use are you to me? Take this sword. Can you strike with it?
Your wrist is feeble. Or take a bow from the weapons on the wall. Can
you draw the string? Your strength is sufficient for the lute, and your
skill for scratching the strings of the barbat. Go and save yourself. I
am alone and every man's hand is against me.'

Zehowah stood still in the room and hesitated, looking into his eyes for
something which she all at once desired with a hot thirst. At last she
