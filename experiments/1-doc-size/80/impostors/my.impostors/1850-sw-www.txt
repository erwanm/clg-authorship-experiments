not come; and they that n»*e once gathered there are parted no more forever ; and all tears are wiped from their eyes. 
I believe I am going fast to that home ; and now my greatest 
concern is, that my little Ellen — my precious baby — may 
follow me and come there too." 

No more was said, nor could be said, till the sound of the 
doctor's steps upon the stair obliged each of them to assume 
an appearance of composure as speedily as possible. But 
they could not succeed perfectly enough to blind him. He 
did not seem very well satisfied, and told Ellen he believed 
he should have to get another nurse, — he was afraid she didn't 
obey orders. 

While the doctor was there Ellen's Bible was brought in ; 
and no sooner was he gone than it underwent as thorough an 
examination as the boxes had received. Ellen went over 
every part of it with the same great care and satisfaction ; but 
mixed with a different feeling. The words that caught her 
eye as she turned over the leaves seemed to echo what her 
mother had been saying to her. It began to grow dear 
already. After a little she rose and brought it to the sofa. 

"Are you satisfied with it, Ellen?" 

" Oh yes, mamma ; it is perfectly beautiful, outside and 
inside. Now, mamma, will you please to write my name in 
this precious book — my name, and anything else you please, 
mother. I'll bring you my new pen to write it with, and I've 
got ink here ; — shall I ?"  

She brought it ; and Mrs. Montgomery wrote Ellen's name, 
and the date of the gift. The pen played a moment in her 
fingers, and then she wrote below the date : 

" ' I love them that love me ; and they that seek me early 
shall find me.' " 

This was for Ellen ; but the next words were not for her ; 
what made her write them ? — 

" ' I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.' " 

They were written almost unconsciously, and as if bowed 
by an unseen force Mrs. Montgomery's head sank upon the 
open page ; and her whole soul went up with her petition : 

" Let these words be my memorial, that I have trusted in 
thee. And oh, when these miserable lips are silent for ever, 
remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast 
caused me to hope ; and be unto ray little one all thou hast 







been to me. Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, thou that 
dwellest in the heavens !" 

She raised her face from the book, closed it, and gave it 
silently to Ellen. Ellen had noticed her action, but had no 
suspicion of the cause ; she supposed that one of her mother's 
frequent feelings of weakness or sickness had made her lean 
her head upon the Bible, and she thought no more about it. 
However, Ellen felt that she wanted no more of her boxes 
that day. She took her old place by the side of her mother's 
sofa, with her head upon her mother's hand, and an expression of quiet sorrow in her face that it had not worn for 
several days.
