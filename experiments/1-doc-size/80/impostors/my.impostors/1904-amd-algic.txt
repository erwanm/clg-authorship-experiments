in such high esteem ! 

"How are you getting along with your black woman ? 
And your new rooms! Husband's talking of build 
ing, our house is old, and we're crowded, and no mis 
take. I do wish Dan would see some nice girl out 
there," nodding her head, "and marry her. Homer's 
counting on getting married when he's twenty-one, 
but I tell him to get his cage first. Birds are easily 
captured. Homer's nice and steady, and he's saving, 
too. He will make a first-class husband. I have my 
eye on a girl for Ben," and her smile brought a warm 
color to my cheek. 

"I hear your father's taking great interest in all the 
goings on. They talked high in '37. Why, you'd 
think the earth would be so full of people there'd 
hardly be standing room, and there's all to the Missis 
sippi River. Not but what the town wants clearing up 
bad, but we don't want another panic." 

She had been knitting as she talked. I liked to hear 
the rattle of her needles, they kept such exact time. 





"Would you mind reading your letter? You're do 
ing nothing, I observe." 

I went in the other room and laid out the page that 
had the most tenderness and longing in it. 

"Yes, yes," she subjoined in a pause. "It's pretty 
much the same as mine, only those things about books 
and his learning Latin, I don't sense that," was her 
comment. 

" 'Twould be awful if that nice man should go 
blind. Then I s'pose Norman would think to stay 
with him as long as he lived. Well, he will have a 
good time, no doubt, and we mustn't murmur s'long as 
he's prosperous. And he may pick up some nice girl. 
Goodness me! Look at that snow! I must trot off 
home. Come over, we miss you so much. And don't 
feel too disappointed about Norman. I'd counted on 
seeing him sure." 

She put up her knitting and bustled about, tied her 
ears up with her woollen hood, and set off cheerily. 
Yes, we were in for a storm, the flakes were like a 
great army sweeping over the land. But it was splen 
did! There was no wind to hurry them, they could 
take their time and be beautiful. 



CHAPTER XI 

A TIME FOR LOVE 

EVERYBODY rejoiced in Norman Hayne's good fortune. 
There was another point in it that sent a pang through 
my heart. Would he outgrow and forget? 

Another friend went out of my small circle in the 
spring, Mrs. Chadwick. Her husband had established 
a business in Buffalo, and they moved thither. I did 
not realize then the valuable friend I had lost. I was 
more interested in the young girls' good time. Homer 
Hayne was always ready to escort Sophie and myself 
to the little parties and merrymakings. Just now Dan 
had one of his periodic fancies for Polly Morrison, and 
his mother was much troubled about it. 

"But if they love each other?" I said. It really 
seemed to me that they must, and now I had begun to 
speculate a little on this mysterious power.
