"Let your captain get under way at once, for the ship will be towed
out. If your crew is all right, I should like to transfer a few seamen
to the ship, for we are rather short-handed," added the principal.

Mr. Fluxion called Captain Terrill, and the order was given to pipe all
hands. As the boatswain's whistle sounded, the principal and the
vice-principal descended to the cabin. Mr. Lowington had begun to
explain his method of dealing with the difficulty, when a messenger
from the captain reported that twelve seamen refused to answer the
summons.

"Ascertain who they are, and get under way without disturbing them,"
said the principal, after the messenger had retired.

"That's a novel way to deal with a mutiny," added Mr. Fluxion, who was
always in favor of decisive measures.

Mr. Lowington stated his views fully, and explained his plan. Though
the vice-principal did not agree with him in regard to his corrective
measures, he consented to adopt them. When they went on deck, the
captain handed Mr. Fluxion a list of the names of the Josephine's
mutineers. They were the twelve runaways who had been transferred to
the consort. Little had succeeded in inducing them to engage in the
plot, but the rest of the crew would not follow their vicious example,
even with the assurance that the mutiny was general on board of the
ship. Under these circumstances, none of the crew of the Josephine
could be spared for service in the Young America, and the boat returned
without them. The principal decided that the ship could be handled with
the available force, which might include a portion of the cooks and
stewards, some of whom were sailors.

The tug-boat had come alongside when the cutter reached the ship. In
order to give any rebel, who had repented, an opportunity to return to
his duty, the grating was removed from the main hatch, and the
boatswain again called all hands to weigh anchor. Only two of them,
however, answered the call. The capstan was manned by the faithful
thirty, reÃ«nforced by the officers and the men on board. A long hawser
had been passed from the bow to the steamer, and as soon as the anchor
was up to the hawse-hole, the signal was given to go ahead. The
Josephine followed as promptly as though every seaman on board
performed his duty, though the sails were not set with the usual
precision. The little squadron went off to the north-west, carrying its
double mutiny with it.

As soon as the ship began to move, after the anchor was secured, the
officers devoted themselves to the duty of stationing the crew. They
were divided into two watches, and their places for making and taking
in sail, reefing and tacking, were assigned to them. As the officers
who had volunteered to serve before the mast were thorough seamen, the
task was speedily accomplished. There were no "green hands" to be
favored, for every one was competent to hand, reef, and steer. By the
time the squadron was well in the offing, the ship's company was in
condition to make sail. About ten miles outside of the harbor, the
steamer was discharged.

"All hands, make sail, ahoy!" shouted the boatswain; and every officer
and seaman sprang to his station.

Lieutenants, masters, midshipmen, and pursers mingled with the seamen,
and the work was done with promptness and precision. Topsails,
top-gallant-sails, and courses were set, and with the wind abeam, the
ship went off to the north-west as comfortably as though no mutiny had
distracted her routine. When everything was made snug for a night at
sea, the roll was called, and the names of the mutineers checked on the
list.

"Young gentleman," said Mr. Lowington, while the faithful were still
assembled in the waist, "I regret that so many of your companions have
resorted to a silly and stupid expedient to redress real or imaginary
grievances. Mutiny is never respectable, under any circumstances; and I
wish to draw a sharp line between those who do their duty and those who
do not. I desire that none of you hold any communication whatever with
the mutineers. Be dignified and gentlemanly, but avoid them. Give them
no information in regard to what transpires on deck. I request you to
do this. I do not give you any order to that effect.

"None of the mutineers will be allowed to come on deck, and I shall
have some means of distinguishing the faithful from the unfaithful."
