"Oh, dear! I wish I didn't have to be one;" and Charlie began to cry.
"I'll wear a big stone on top of my head."

"I am afraid it is too late. You are as tall as Granny now."

Hal gained slowly. All this time he was thinking what he should do?
for he had a presentiment that he might never be very strong again.
No more working around on farms; and, though there were some sedentary
trades in cities, he would meet with no chance to attain to them. So he
must have the green-house.

By spring he was able to go about pretty well. But he looked white as a
ghost, quite unlike the round rosy Hal of other days.

"Kit," said he, "you'll have to be my right-hand man this summer. Maybe
by another Christmas we might have the violin."

"O Hal! I'd work from morning till night," and the eager eyes were
luminous.

"Well, we'll see."

Charlie was seized with a helpful fit also. After the garden was
ploughed, they all planted and hoed and weeded; and, as it was an early
season, they had some quite forward vegetables.

One day Hal went over to Salem, and invested a few dollars in
tuberoses, besides purchasing some choice flower-seeds. Then he stopped
into a small place where he had noticed cut-flowers, and began to
inquire whether they ever bought any.

"All I can get," said the man. "Flowers are coming to be the rage.
People think they can't have weddings or funerals without them."

"But you want white ones mostly?"

"White ones for funerals and brides. There are other occasions, though,
when colored ones are worth twice as much, and as much needed."

"You raise some?" said Hal.

"All I can. I have a small green-house. Come in and see it. Did you
think of starting in the business?"

Hal colored, and cleared his voice of a little tremble.

"I believe I shall some time," he said.

The green-house was not very large, to be sure, now quite empty, as the
flowers were out of doors.

"I wonder how much such a place would cost?" Hal asked with some
hesitation.

"About a thousand dollars," replied the man, eying it rather
critically. "Have you had any experience with flowers?"

"Not much;" and Hal sighed. A thousand dollars! No, he could never do
any thing like that.

"The best way would be to study a year or two with a florist."

"I suppose so."

Hal was quite discouraged, for that appeared out of his power as well.

"There is not so great a demand for flowers in summer, you know; but
in winter they are scarce, and bring good prices. Still, some of the
choicer kinds sell almost any time; fine rosebuds, heliotrope, and such
things."

After a little further talk, Hal thanked the man, and said good-by with
a feeling of disappointment. A hot-house was quite beyond his reach.

However, he did mean to have some early vegetable beds for another
spring--if nothing happened, he said to himself, remembering his last
summer's plans.

Not that he was idle, either. He did a good deal in the lighter kinds
of gardening. The new houses required considerable in the way of
