rather remain poor, and let you keep on taking 
care of me, but see here" and he handed 





him a letter. "That came this morning, after 
you left." 

Braith read it eagerly, and looked up with a 
brighter face than he had worn for many a day. 

"By Jove!" he said. "By Jupiter!" 

Rex smiled sadly at his enthusiasm. 

"This means health, and a future, and 
everything, to you, Rex!" 

"Health and \vealth, and happiness," said 
Gethryn bitterly. 

"Yes, you ungrateful young reprobate that's 
exactly what it means. Go to your Arcachon, 
by all means, since you've  got a fortune to go 
on, I say you you didn't know your aunt 
very well, did you? You're not cut up much?" 

"I never saw her half a dozen times in my 
whole life. But she's been generous to me, 
poor old lady!" 

"I should think so. Two hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars is a nice sum for a young fel 
low to find in his pocket all on a sudden. And 
now you want to go away and get well, and 
come back presently and begin where you left 
off, a year ago. Is that it?" 

"That is it. J shall never get well here, and 



 

I mean to get well if I can," -he paused, and 
hesitated. "That was the only letter in my box 
this morning." 

Braith did not answer. 

"It is nearly two months now," continued 
Rex, in a low voice. 

"What are your plans?" interrupted Braith, 
brusquely. 

Rex flushed. 

"I'm going first" he answered, rather drily, 
"to Arcachon. You see by the letter my aunt 
died in Florence. Of course I've  got to go and 
measure out a lot of Italian red tape before I 
can get the money. It seems to me the sooner 
I can get into the pine air and the sea-breezes 
at Arcachon, the better chance I have of being 
fit to push on to Florence, via the Riviera, be 
fore the summer heat." 

"And then?" 

"I don't know." 

"You will come back?" 

"When'I am cured." 

There was a long silence. At last Gethryn 
put a thin hand on Braith's shoulder, and
