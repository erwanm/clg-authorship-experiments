room, and she and Aunt Jane had some words over it, but Jenny carried
her point. It was lovely and quiet, and Helen was thankful.

Yes, she had grown away from them; while she loved them just as well,
she thought she loved Uncle Jason better. The life was so different. It
need not be so hard and,--yes, it was coarse, really untender. Aunt Jane
would have suffered anything for her children's sake, but it must be in
her way. After all these years of married life, children, and a
certain degree of hard-won prosperity, she knew better than anyone else
how the world could be managed.

'Reely and Fan were fascinated with Helen, and Jenny said she had a good
deal of common sense, and she supposed all the airish ways were just
right at school, but they seemed queer among common folks. It was
inevitable that Helen and Aunt Jane should clash, and Helen felt even at
the risk of being misunderstood and wrongfully accused, she must
establish her own standing. She had not come home to help with
housework.

"I wish I'd never let you gone over there to wait on that old woman, and
have your head filled with airs and graces that you think sets you up
above your family. I knew that day I should be sorry for it. And this is
all the thanks I get for what I've done for you, while you'll crawl on
the ground after her."

"No, I shouldn't; I do not," replied Helen with dignity. "I shall always
feel thankful to you and Uncle Jason for what you have done, and, Aunt
Jane, when I get to where I can earn money I want to pay you back for my
keep after father died----"

Helen's face was scarlet and the hot blood was racing up and down in her
pulses.

"Yes," she continued, controlling her voice by a strong effort, "I have
made that one of my duties. I can't take your way of life, Aunt Jane,
but I shall always feel grateful for the care."

"Helen Grant, do you suppose your uncle would take one penny from you,
his own sister's child! It isn't that, it's the--the----"

"Oh, Aunt Jane, I am grateful. Do not let us quarrel because our paths
lie in different directions. I must work in the way I am best fitted
for, the way I shall like above all things----"

"Oh, yes, you'll go off with that woman, and she'll get tired of you and
ship you off. You mark my words."

"Then I can take up teaching, which will be my delight. She has offered
me these two years of training and I mean to make the best of them, to
crowd in all I can, to fit myself to earn my living in the way I like
best of all. I do suppose we all have some choice."

Aunt Jane flounced out of the room. There was something burning on the
stove, and she was glad of the excuse. And all she said when Helen was
going over to North Hope, was:

"Well, come whenever you like. The house is always open to you."

Uncle Jason was very tender to her.

"Mother's a bit cranky," he said. "Even Jenny plagues her about it. I
think she's jealous of that Mrs. Van Dorn, and she has an idea of her
own about bringing up girls. But they're not all alike and some are fit
for one thing, some for another. Jenny's got the right of it. It's best
for everyone to do what he's best fitted for, or she," smiling a
little. "And it stands to reason that you might take after your own
father. You're not all Mulford."

It was very delightful to be back with Mrs. Dayton. One new couple had
come, but they were very quiet people. And the girls about began to call
on her. Ella Graham had enough of the High School.

"I just went for the name of it," she explained. "I should never teach,
and what is the use of wasting all that time and bothering your brains
for nothing? I shall get married the first good chance I have."

Lu Searing bewailed the hard work as well and wasn't sure she would keep
on. She wanted to go somewhere to boarding school, she had heard girls
had such fun getting in scrapes and out of them again. Marty Pendleton
was sick of it too, and was going to learn dressmaking. Dan Erlick had
