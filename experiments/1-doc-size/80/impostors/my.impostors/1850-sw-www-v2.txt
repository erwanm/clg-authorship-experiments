" There is an antidote in that for every trouble. You 
know who said, ' he that cometh to me shall never hunger, 
and he that belie veth on me shall never thirst.' " 

"It troubles me," said he after a pause, — " to leave you 
so much alone. I don't know that I were not best to take 
you with me every week." 

" no !" said Ellen, — " don't think of me. I don't mind 
it indeed. I do not always feel so — sometimes, — but I get 
along very well ; and I would rather stay here, indeed I 
would. I am always happy as soon as Monday morning 
comes." 

He rose up suddenly and began to walk up and down the 
room. 

" Mr. John"— 
"What, Ellie?" 

" I do sometimes seek His face very much when I cannot 
find it." 

She hid her face in the sofa-cushion. He was silent a few 
minutes, and then stopped his walk. 

" There is something wrong then with you, Ellie," he said 
gently. " How has it been through the week ? If you can 
let day after day pass without remembering your best friend, 
it may be that when you feel the want you will not readily 





find him. How is it daily, EUie? is seeking his face your 
first concern ? do you give a sufficient time faithfully to your 
Bible and prayer ?" 

Ellen shook her head ; no words were possible. He took 
up his walk again. The silence had lasted a length of tirae 
and he was still walking, when Ellen came to his side and 
laid her hand on his arm. 

" Have you settled that question with your conscience, 
Ellie ?" 

She weepingly answered yes. They walked a few turns 
up and down. 

" Will you promise me, Ellie, that every day when it shall 
be possible, you will give an hour at least to this business ? — 
whatever else may be done or undone ?" 

Ellen promised ; and then with her hand in his they continued their walk through the room till Mr. Humphreys and 
the servants came in. Her brother's prayer that night Ellen 
never forgot. 

No more was said at that time about her going to Ventnor, 
But a week or two after John smilingly told her to get all her 
private affairs arranged and to let her friends know they need 
not expect to see her the next Sunday, for that he was going to 
take her with him. As she saw he had made up his mind, 
Ellen said nothing in the way of objecting ; and now that the 
decision was taken from her was really very glad to go. She 
arranged everything, as he had said ; and was ready Saturday morning to set off with a very light heart. 

They went in the sleigh. In a happy quiet mood of mind, 
Ellen enjoyed everything exceedingly. She had not been to 
Ventnor in several months ; the change of scene was very 
grateful. She could not help thinking, as they slid along 
smoothly and swiftly over the hard-frozen snow, that it loas 
a good deal pleasanter, for once, than sitting alone in the parlor at home with her work-basket. Those days of solitary 
duty, however, had prepared her for the pleasure of this one ; 
Ellen knew that, and was ready to be thankful for everything. 
Throughout the whole way, whether the eye and mind silently 
indulged in roving, or still better loved talk interrupted that, 
as it often did, Ellen was in a state of most unmixed and unruffled satisfaction. John had not the slightest reason to 
doubt the correctness of his judgment in bringing her. He
