the rest of us mortals." 

" What expectations does he indulge which you 
are not willing to meet ? " 

" That's the very thing ! " cried Christina, in her 
turn stooping to arrange the little sticks and pile 
more on; "he is unreasonable." 

" How ? " 

" Wants me to marry him." 

" Is that unreasonable ? " 

" Yes ! till things are ready for such a step, and 
I am ready." 

" What things ? " 

" Dolly, he is only the first officer of his ship. 
He was distinguished in the last war, and he has 
the prospect of promotion. I don't want to marry 
him till he is a captain." 

" Why ? " said Dolly. 

" Why ? Don't you understand ? He would 
have a better position then, and better pay; and 
could give me a better time generally; and mamma thinks we ought to wait. And I like waiting. 
It's better fun, I do think, to be engaged than to 
be married t I know I shouldn't have my head 



 

near so much if I was married to Sandie. I do 
just as I like now; for mamma and I are always 
of a mind." 

" And are not you and Mr. Shubrick of a mind ? " 

"Not about this," said Christina, getting up from 
the hearth, 'and laughing. 

" Pray, if one may ask, how long have you and 
he been waiting already ? " 

"0, he thinks it is a great while; but what is 
the harm of waiting ? " 

" Well, how long is it, Christina ? " 

" Dolly, we were engaged very young. It was 
before I left school ; one summer when I was home 
for the vacation. I was sixteen ; that is four years 
ago, and more." 

" Four years ! " cried Dolly. 

"Yes. Of course we were too young then to 
think of marrying. He was home on furlough, 
and I was home for the vacation ; and our houses 
were near together; and so we made it up. His 
people were not very well off, but mine were; so 
there was nothing in the way, and nobody objected 
much; only mother said we must wait." 

" What are you waiting for now, Christina ? " 

"I told you. I am in no hurry, for my part. 
I want Sandie to get his ship; and in the mean 
while it is just as nice to be as we are. We 
see each other when we can ; and Italy is Italy ; 
and I am very contented. Unfortunately, Sandie 
isn't." 

" How long do you propose to go on waiting ? "
