the natural and pardonable simper of youth. 

Was she interested in that young ass who was 
risking his bones over there in the city? They had 
come up on the same boat. Still, one never could 
tell. The young fellow was almost as odd in his way 



 

the girl was in hers. He seldom spoke> and drank 

 with a persistence that was sinister. He was never 

drunk in the accepted meaning of the word; rather 
 walked in a kind of stupefaction. Supposing Ah 

Cum's luck failed for once? 

The manager made a gesture of dismissal, and 
added up the bill for the Misses Jedson, who were 
iretuming to Hong-Kong in the morning. 



CHAPTER VI 

SroNEY CARTON, thought Ruth, in pw-l 
suit of a sing-song girl! The idea was so' 
incongruous that a cold little smile parted 
her lips. It seemed as if each time her imaginatioD 
reached out investingly, an invisible lash beat it 
back. Still, she knew instinctively that all of 
Sidney Carton's life had not been put upon the 
printed page. But to go courting a slave-girl, at the 
risk of physical hurt ! A shudder of distaste wrinkled 
her shoulders. 

She opened the window, for the night was mild, 
and sat on the floor with her chin resting upon the 
window-sill. Even the stars were strangers. Where 
was this kindly world she had drawn so rosily in

askance at everybody else. To escape one phase of 
lonehness she had plunged into another, so vast that 
her courage sometimes faltered. 

She recalled how she had stretched out her arms 
toward the magic blue horizon. Just beyond there

bur "vireeks, what had she learned? That all horizons "virere lies : that smiles and handshakes and good- 
byes and welcomes were lies: that there were really 
no to-morrows, only a treadmill of to-days: and that 
out of these lies and mirages she had plucked a bitter truth â€” she was alone. 

She turned her cheek to the cold sill; and by and 
by the sill grew warm and wet with tears. She 
"viranted to stay where she was; but tears were dangerous; the more she wept, the weaker she would 
become defensively. She rose briskly, turned on the 
light, and opened Les Miserables to the episode of 
the dark forest: where Jean Valjean reaches out and 
takes Cosette's frightful pail from her chapped little 
hands. 

There must be persons tender and loving in this 
world. There must be real Valjeans, else how could 
authors write about them? Supposing some day 
she met one of these astonishing creators, who could
