mention the father, she turns into marble. No; she'd 
never go back. Mae, she's the honestest human 
being I ever saw or heard of; and at the same time 
she is velvet over steel. And yet, she would be easy 
prey in her present state of mind to any plausible  
attractive scoundrel. That's why I'm so anxioua 
to get her to a haven." 

"Come along, then. You've got me interested 
and curious. If you were ten years younger, you'd 
have me wondering." 

The doctor did not reply to this rather ambiguous 
statement, but pushed back his chair and signed to 
McClintock to follow. They found Ruth reading 
to Spurlock, whose shoulders and head were propped 
by pillows. 

McClintock did not exaggerate his ability to read 
faces. It was his particular hobby, and the leisure 
he had to apply to it had given him a remarkable 
appraising eye. Within ten minutes he had read 
much more than had greeted his eye. A wave of 
pity went over him —  pity for the patient, the girl> 
and his friend. The poor old imbecile! Why, 


this child was a firebrand, a wrecker, if ever he had 
seen one; and the worst kind because she was un- 
conscious of her gifts. 

As for the patient, his decision was inunediate. 
Here was no crooked soul; a little weak perhaps, 
impulsive beyond common, but fundamentally hon- 
est. Given time and the right environment, and he 
would outgrow these defects. Confidence in himself 
would strengthen him. If the boy had done any- 
thing wrong back there in the States, his would be 
the brand of conscience to pay him out in full. With 
a little more meat on him, he would be handsome. 

"My friend here," said McClintock, "tells me you 
are looking for a job." 

"Yes." 

"Well, IVe a job open; but I don't want you to 
get the wrong idea of it. In the first place, it will 
be damnably dull. You won't often see white folks. 
There will be long stretches of idleness, heat, and 
enervation; and always the odour of drying coconut. 
A good deal of the food will be in tins. You'll Kve 
to hate chicken; and the man in you will rise up and 
demand strong drink. But nobody drinks on my 
island unless I offer it, which is seldom. If there is 
any drinking, I'll do it." 

Spurlock smiled at the doctor. 

"He'll not trouble you on the liquor side, Mac." 

"So much the better. You will have a bungalow 
to yourself," continued McCKntock, "and. your 



 

morning meal will be your own affair. But luncheon 
and dinners you will sit at my table. I'm a stickler 
about clothes and clean chins. How you dress when 
you're loafing will be no concern of mine; but fresh 
twill or Shantungs when you dine with me, collar and 
tie. If you hke books and music, we'll get along." 

''Then you are taking me on?" Spurlock's eye» 
grew soft like those of a dog that, expecting the whip, 
saw only the kindly hand. 

" I am going to give you a try."
