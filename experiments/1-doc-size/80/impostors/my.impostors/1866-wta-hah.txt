"He won't shoot us--will he?"

"No; he won't hurt nothin'."

The raft came up to the shore, and the trapper landed.

"How d'ye do, Rattleshag?" said Ethan.

The strange visitor made no reply, but walked deliberately up to the
young exiles, gave his hand first to Ethan, then to Fanny.

"Toler'ble, considering," said he, at last.

"Whar did you kim from?"

"Over thar," he answered, pointing to the settlement, and shaking his
head.

"Anybody thar?" asked Ethan, anxiously.

"Injins."

"No white folks?"

"All gone: some on 'em's killed, and some on 'em's kerried off. Awful
times, everywhar," added the trapper, shaking his head mournfully.
"Whar's the Injin boy?"

"Up thyer," answered Ethan, pointing to the cabin where Wahena had been
secured as soon as the raft was discovered, for another attack from the
Indians had been anticipated. "You may let him loose again, Fanny."

She was always glad to perform this office for her captive friend, and
she soon returned to the shore with Wahena.

"He's all safe--ain't he?" asked Rattleshag.

"Yes; we hain't hurt him; and he's as fond of Fanny as a pet puppy
dog."

"Glad on't. I was tooken by the Injins over thar, and got nigh bein'
skelped. Lean B'ar let me go to kim over here arter the boy," added the
trapper.

"We can't let him go," said Ethan.

"I reckon you mought."

Ethan explained in what manner the presence of Wahena had saved them
from the Indians.

"We can't spare him till we get out of the woods ourselves," added
Ethan.

"Then I must go back and be skelped," replied Rattleshag, solemnly. "I
promised Lean B'ar thet I'd git the boy, or else I'd kim back myself;
and old Rattleshag never broke his word to Injin or white man."

"Thet's so," said Ethan, who knew the reputation of the trapper for
simple honesty and fidelity.

"Hev you got a boat?" asked Rattleshag.

"Yes."

"Then I reckon we kin go down to Mankato. The sogers is drivin' the
Injins back. Thyer's ben awful times all through the country; more 'n a
thousand men, women, and children hes ben killed. I've trevelled all
through from Big Stone, dodgin' the Injins all the way. They are as
savage as painters. I kim down hyer to git away from 'em, but I found
they'd ben hyer too," added the trapper, with another melancholy shake
of the head. "It's awful."

Rattleshag over-estimated the number of victims to this terrible
massacre, though it has been stated as high as seven hundred. He
related to the young exiles his adventures in his long journey through
the devoted region which had been the scene of so much cruelty and
bloodshed. He told of the men, women, and children he had seen lying
dead and mangled in the deserted settlements; of the wounded, starving,
and dying fugitives he had met in their flight; and of the desolation
