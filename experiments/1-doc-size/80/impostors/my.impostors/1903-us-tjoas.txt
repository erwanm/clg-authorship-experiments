— Understand what I mean — poor fools, do 
not think it is for myself that I fear. If I 
wanted to fight a way for myself — I could do it 
yet — never fear. But ah, you will save the 
mother and not her child! What I weep for, 
what I die for, is my ART! 

My vision, my life, my joy, my fire! These 
are the things that are dying! And when the 
soul is dead do you think that I shall care about 



the body? Do you think that I will stay in this 
world a shell, a mockery, a corpse? Stay either 
to putrefy with pleasure or to be embalmed in 
dulness? Nay, you do not know me! 

— I said to myself to-night, " If I perish in 
this world it will be because I was too far ahead 
of my environment — that and that only. It will 
be because I was pure, single-hearted, conse- 
crated, and because of such you neither know 
nor care." Do I fear to say that? I am done 
with shame — I think that I am dying — let me 
speak the truth. 

— And I have really said the word then — the 
word that can not be recalled — that my hope is 
dead, that I give up — that I can not live my life? 
Nay — I do not have to say the word, the word 
says itself.

To-day I shook myself together. I could not 
stand such wretchedness. I said, I will get a 
novel, and I will put myself into it — grimly — I 
will read in spite of everything. 

And such a book as I lighted on by chance! 
— Once I had whole yawning vistas of books 






toward which I stretched out my arms; but 
somehow I had forgotten them all to-day. I 
could do no better than pick up a book by 
chance. — 

I picked up Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and 
I found myself in the midst of the same misery 
that haunts me here. I read it, but it did not 
help me. 

— It is strange what poverty has ground into 
my soul. I find myself reading such a book with 
but one feeling, one idea crying out in me. I 
discover that my whole being is reduced to the 
great elemental, primitive instinct of self-preser- 
vation. Love is dead in me, generosity, humani- 
ty, imagination is dead, — everything but one 
wild-beast passion; and I find myself panting as 
I read: " Get some money! Get some money! 
Hold on to it! " 

— After a while I think suddenly: "And I 
am a poet! " That brings a moan from me and 
I sit shuddering.

Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the most 
unconvincing books I ever read. I neither be- 
lieved in it nor cared about it in the slightest.
