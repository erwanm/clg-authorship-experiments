IV. 



Dartmouth had been at Rhyd-Alwyn two 
weeks, when Sir Iltyd turned to him one night as 
he was leaving the dining-room and asked him 
to follow him into the library for a few moments. 

" I feel quite alarmed," said Harold to Weir, 
as the door closed behind her father. " Do you 
suppose he is going to tell me that I do not give 
satisfaction ? " 

"Harold! " exclaimed Weir, reprovingly, " I 
wish you would not talk as if you were a butler; 
you look much more dignified than you ever talk. 
You look like an English nobleman, and you talk 
like any ordinary young man about town." 

" My dearest girl, would you have me a Sir 
Charles Grandison ? The English nobleman 
of your imagination is the gentleman who 
perambulates the pages of Miss Burney's novels. 
The present species and the young man about 
town are synonomous animals." 

" There you are again ! You always make me 
laugh ; I cannot help that; but I wish you would 
do yourself justice, nevertheless. You may not 
know it, but if you would only put on a ruff and 
satin doublet and hose and wig, and all the rest 




of it, you would look exactly like one of the 
courtiers of the court of Queen Elizabeth. You 
are a perfect type cf the English aristocrat." 

" My dear Lady Jane Grey, if you had been 
an American girl, you would have said a perfect 
gentleman, and I should never have spoken to 
you again. As a matter of fact, I always feel it 
a sort of sacrilege that I do not address you in 
blank verse; only my attempts thereat are so 
very bad. But it is never too late to mend. We 
will read Pope together, Shakspere, and all the 
rest of the old boys. We will saturate our minds 
with their rhythm, and we will thereafter
communicate in stately phrase and rolling periods." 

" It would be a great deal better than slang 
and 'facetiousness,' as you call it. That is all 
very well for Lord Bective Hollington; it suits 
him; but you should aim at a higher standard." 

Dartmouth, who was standing by the chimney- 
piece near the chair on which she was sitting, 
put his hand under her chin and raised her face, 
smiling quizzically as he did so. 

" My dear child," he said, "you are too clever 
to fall into the common error of women, and 
idealize your lover. The tendency is a 
constituent part of the feminine nature, it is true. The 
average woman will idealize the old tweed coat 
on her lover's back. But your eyes are too clear 
for that sort of thing. I am a very ordinary 
young man, my dear. Becky is twice as clever â€” " 



 

" He is not! " burst in Weir, indignantly. "A 
man who can do nothing but chaff and joke and 
"talk witty nonsense! "
