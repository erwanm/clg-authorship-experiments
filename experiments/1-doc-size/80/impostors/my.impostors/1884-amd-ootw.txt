"No, no," she protested eagerly, while her bright face 
seemed to lure him on to further confidence. 




"I convinced myself that my ardent desire would never 
be realized by any work that I could do in creative art. 
I can copy, I can photograph and finish thoroughly well ; 
and isn't it brave Carlyle who advises a man, having found 
his work, to keep at it and find happiness therein? " 

It was so long since anyone had quoted Carlyle to her. 
She gave him a rare, pleased smile. 

" All the same, I have gone on studying. After I reach 
the degree of prosperity hinted at before, I shall feel free 
to indulge in some pleasures, without the high aims. But 
if one cannot pluck the rose, one may still enjoy rambling 
through the garden.  ' 

His spice of cheerful philosophy pleased her. Then 
she said, a little gravely : " I should be sorry to make a 
mistake about my daughter. Perhaps it would be better 
to do the work she can do well than attempt the kind that 
must bring dissatisfaction and disappointment. I had 
planned for her to be a teacher. She is an apt and thor- 
ough scholar." 

" But surely there need be no haste in deciding ? " 

" No," and Mrs. Marshall drew a breath of relief. " This 
is her first year in the high school." 

" When we come to know each other better I may per- 
haps suggest something. I hope we shall be good neigh- 
bors." 

A customer interrupted the conversation. Mr. Archer 
lingered a moment, inspecting some painted satin panels, 
and then wished her a polite good evening. 

Before the week ended he came in with his betrothed, 
a nice-looking, sensible girl, who had evidently made quite 
an ideal of him. It hardly seemed to Mrs. Marshall that 
she was Mr. Archer's equal in correct taste or intellect, 
yet if there must be a difference, was it not better on that 
side? 

They made several neighborly arrangements, and the 
bride-elect ordered a wedding bonnet. The family would 





go out early in March, and about the middle of the month 
the newly-married couple would come in. 

Celia was delighted with the prospect. 

" And we can really have a parlor," she exclaimed, joy- 
ously. "It doesn't matter so very much when we are 
busy, which is nearly all the time, but if there did come a 
little leisure ! " 

" After this year we shall have some, I hope. I shall 
count on paying only one hundred dollars this coming six 
months, which will allow me a little to furnish with. And 
then we take the best our circumstances will allow." 

They all went to see Mr. Archer married in church. 
The bride was one of quite a large family, plain, indus- 
trious, middle-class people ; but she looked very winsome 
in her becoming bridal array. After a jaunt of a week 
they returned and began their furnishing. To the great 
delight of the Marshalls the new Mrs. Archer had a 
piano.
