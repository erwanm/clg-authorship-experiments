unwholesome vices ; he would never have made a heavy 
villain. Through the earlier years his father had been 
a tolerably successful gambler, but later, misfortune had 
dogged his footsteps. When his mother had lost her sylph- 
like figure, and coarsened in feature, she had fallen to second 
and third rate positions. He had played in orchestras, and 
might have done better had he not so hated the associa- 
tions. After her death he and his father had wandeied 
about Europe for a while, the elder man missing his stay 
and support, and the love that had ministered to him with 
such passionate fondness. He _ had flown to opium for 
solace, and his health was so shattered that Jasper felt the 
frail life must end shortly. He would obey his dying 
mother's behest and afterward follow. his own wayward 
fancies. 



 

But the unexpected fortune — for though his father had 
always grumbled about being wronged out of it by his strait- 
laced, penurious old uncle, he, Jasper, had never imagined 
anything could possibly come of it — had suddenly brought 
to the surface some of the finer graces of the young man's 
nature. To be taken at a high estimate flattered him 
immensely. He preserved a wise reticence about his past, 
aud his father had never been personally communicative. 
Regina's friendliness, her lofty bearing and pure pride, 
woke an intense admiration in his soul. But he was 
not capable of redemption even through love, he pos- 
sessed none of the truer ambitions, he lived merely in the 
present, in personal, sensuous delights. The few inspired 
longings died out. A blinder woman, who loved him, 
mighb have kept him to a certain height. Eegina's inter- 
est was too impersonal, too really intellectual. The tones 
and looks and smiles he had seen women use were all 
deficient. He could come so near, no nearer. Cynthia's 
half satirical bluntness secretly mortified him at times. 
So he had turned to the sweet, impulsive, daring, inex- 
perienced child, Perdita, and taken delicious draughts of 
pleasure with little thought of the ending until an urgent 
necessity confronted him. 

There was at first a curious jealousy of Winterburne as 
something belonging to the Halfords' past life, in which he 
had no share. Eegina's distance and coldness had appeared 
to him as evidences of positive dislike, and he, too, ranged 
himself on the side of what he considered her settled con- 
victions. He caught easily at second-hand opinions. But 
ijow that he had come to realize and enjoy the advantage of 
wealth, he grudged the other his capacity of increasing it. 
He had a way of depreciating him with small touches of irony 
too delicate to resent, until it became absolutely envious, 
until he covertly accused him of dishonest purposes. Only 
the fact that the Bradley lands are not to be the greater 
factor in Winterburne's fortune roused Eegina to a sense 
o£ her own injustice in allowing these half-veiled sneers to 
pass unchallenged. 





This Jasper takes as an evidence of her growing inter- 
est in him. He makes the one effort, as he thinks, to come 
up to her standard; but it is compounded largely of a desire 
to triumph over Winterburne and possess a wife whose ambi- 
tion will be a higher social status. In her hands he will 
be sure of not dropping down. To have the sole right to 
this proud, beautiful girl seems worth striving for. 

His failure he ascribes not so much to her preference for 
"Winterburne, as to the desire of sharing his wealth, since 
he knows this would be the moving power if he were a 
woman. With the spite of a small mind he has planted 
an arrow to rankle in that proud soul. For the rest, the 
quality he calls fate, and in which he largely believes, has 
led him along. But now he is done with Beverly. His 
experience in living up to a long line of ancestors has not
