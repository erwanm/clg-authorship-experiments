For it seems to Cynthia, as much as she likes Armitage, 
and they are all very close friends, he too wants to pull the 





Stream of goodness iu the chanuol he lias walled up. "Seek 
first the kingdom of heaven," and the rest will, be added, 
but must not the seekers really know what the kingdom 
of heaven may be to them ? 

" But it is love, all of it, divine love." He looks at her 
in perplexity. 

" Then ought not love really to be made lovely ? " 

"I — I don't understand you." 

" I'm afraid heaven is too far off for most people. They 
live and suffer here, their wants are all so intensely per- 
sonal, and they come after a while to have a vague trust iu 
God because he is pitiful, and a desire for heaven because 
it is rest ; but they keep it a long way off. They are not 
going to die until the far end of life — it always looks so 
far off when one is well and strong. And I've remarked 
too," with a curious inward smile that just softens her face, 
" that the sick are always anxious to get well, and the old 
people are in no hurry to die." 

"Well — and then?" 

" I suppose they want a good deal of living grace. That 
would bring the other when the time of dying came. I 
think sometimes if people put the best and sweetest side of 
religion out — if every one who really believed lived up to 
the wisest and truest that they do know, and to the ' inas- 
much ' " — 

" But they won't let you do for them oftentimes," he 
cries irritably. " They will have none of your wisdom." 

" It was so a long while ago, you remember. It requires 
a great deal of hopeful patience. And people must come 
to see for themselves. They look too much through other 
eves. They go away and forget. Oh," she cries with an 
abrupt laugh that is in no sense amusement, — "I can't 
preach a bit ! I can only teach some of the plain little 
things. But it seems to me that everybody is trying to do 
too much." 

The revival is a kind of old-fashioned factor after all. 
The women as usual do most of the church-going. A few 
of the braver ones go down in town and try to rouse up the 




tiverl, anxious women and the stolid men who cannot at the 
first talk be convinced that smoking a pipe of tobacco is a 
deadly sin. Old Dr. Farraud denounces his enemies — all 
new ways and methods are comprehended in this  quite 
as vigorously and picturesquely as the Psalmist. The work 
that is not directly of God cannot prosper. 

Jason Prall is a subject of interest to the opposite side 
of the house. He goes to church and listens attentively. 
But he still waits for his call. 

" Fer I don't see how a man kin git religion athout a 
call," he persists. " He must feel some sort o' drawrin'. 
An' I've jest prayed for that thair call fer nigh onto thirty 
year." 

" And you really don't expect to be saved ? " questions 
Lois Strong with an amused contempt. 

"Well — I can't say that nuther. 'Tain't fer a poor 
human creetur to hurry God's ways. An' one don't want 
to make any mistake an' be self-deceived."
