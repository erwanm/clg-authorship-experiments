" Is it what is called an opera you want to write, like like 
the Creation, for instance ? " asked Deal. The " Creation " 
was the only long piece of music he had ever heard. 

Carl groaned. " Oh, don't talk of it ! " he said ; then add 
ed, irritably, " It's a song, that's all the song of a Southern 
swamp." 

" Call it by it's real name, Devil," said the elder brother, 
grimly. 

" I would, if I was rich enough to have a picture painted 
the Spirit of the Swamp a beautiful woman, falsely called 
a devil by cowards, dark, languorous, mystical, sleeping among 
the vines I saw up there, with the great red blossoms drop 
ping around her." 

" And the great mottled snakes coiling over her? " 

" I didn't see any snakes." 

"Well," said Mark, refilling his pipe, "now I'm going to 
tell you my story. W T hen I met you on that windy pier at 
Exton, and proposed that you should come down here with 
me, I was coming myself, in any case, wasn't I ? And why ? 
I wanted to get to a place where I could be warm warm, 
hot, baked ; warm through and through ; warm all the time. 




I wanted to get to a place where the very ground was warm. 
And now I'll tell you why." 

He rose from his seat, laid down his pipe, and, extending 
his hand, spoke for about fifteen minutes without pause. 
Then he turned, went back hastily to the old chimney, where 
red coals still lingered, and sat down close to the glow, leaving 
Carl wonder-struck in his tilted chair. The elder man leaned 
over the fire and held his hands close to the coals; Carl 
watched him. It was nine o clock, and the thermometer 
marked eighty. 

For nearly a month after Christmas, life on the old planta 
tion went on without event or disaster. Carl, with his crutch 
and cane, could not walk far; his fancy now was to limp 
through the east orange-aisle to the place of tombs, and sit 
there for hours, playing softly, what might be called crooning, 
on his violin. The place of tombs was a small, circular space 
surrounded by wild orange-trees in a close, even row, like a 
hedge ; here were four tombs, massive, oblong blocks of the 
white conglomerate of the coast, too coarse-grained to hold 
inscription or mark of any kind. Who the old Spaniards were 
whose bones lay beneath, and what names they bore in the 
flesh, no one knew ; all record was lost. Outside in the wild 
thicket was a tomb still more ancient, and of different con 
struction : four slabs of stone, uncovered, about three feet 
high, rudely but firmly placed, as though inclosing a coffin. 
In the earth between these low walls grew a venerable cedar ; 
but, old as it was, it must have been planted by chance or by 
hand after the human body beneath had been laid in its place. 

" Why do you come here ? " said Deal, pausing and look 
ing into the place of tombs, one morning, on his way to the 
orange-grove. " There are plenty of pleasanter spots about." 

" No ; I like this better," answered Carl, without stopping 
the low chant of his violin. " Besides, they like it too." 

"Who?" 

" The old fellows down below. The chap outside there, 
who must have been an Aztec, I suppose, and the original 





proprietor, catches a little of it ; but I generally limp over and
