"Never, Ma'am," said Manning inexorably. 
She turned the next instant to challenge the 
stranger who had come down from the house. 
"A gentleman, Ma'am," she announced; and, 
retiring while Mrs. Beever rose to meet the vis- 





itor, she drew, with the noise of a lawn-mower, a 
starched tail along the grass. 

Dennis Vidal, with his hat off, showed his 
hostess a head over which not a year seemed to 
have passed. He had still his young, sharp, 
meagre look, and it came to her that the other 
time as well he had been dressed in double- 
breasted blue of a cut that made him sailorly. 
It was only on a longer view that she saw his 
special signs to be each a trifle intensified. He 
was browner, leaner, harder, finer ; he even struck 
her as more wanting in height. These facts, how 
ever, didn't prevent another fact from striking 
her still more: what was most distinct in his 
face was that he was really glad to take her by 
the hand. That had an instant effect on her : 
she could glow with pleasure, modest matron as 
she was, at such an intimation of her having, so 
many years before, in a few hours, made on a 
clever young man she liked an impression that 
could thus abide with him. In the quick light 
of it she liked him afresh ; it was as if their friend 
ship put down on the spot a firm foot that was 
the result of a single stride across the chasm of 
time. In this indeed, to her clear sense there 
was even something more to pity him for : it was 



 

such a dreary little picture of his interval, such 
an implication of what it had lacked, that there 
had been so much room in it for an ugly old 
woman at Wilverley. She motioned him to sit 
down with her, but she immediately remarked 
that before she asked him a question she had an 
important fact to make known. She had delayed 
too long, while he waited there, to let him under 
stand that Rose Armiger was at Eastmead. She 
instantly saw, at this, that he had come in com 
plete ignorance. The range of alarm, in his face, 
was narrow ; but he coloured, looking grave ; 
and after a brief debate with himself he inquired 
as to Miss Armiger's actual whereabouts. 

"She has gone out, but she may reappear at 
any moment," said Mrs. Beever. 

" And if she does will she come out here ? " 

"I've an impression she'll change her dress 
first. That may take her a little time." 

" Then I'm free to sit with you ten minutes ? " 

" As long as you like, dear Mr. Vidal. It's for 
you to choose whether you'll avoid her." 

"I dislike dodging I dislike hiding," Dennis 
returned; "but I daresay that if I had known 
where she was I wouldn't have come." 

"I feel hatefully rude but you took a leap
