were singing, "O Strassburg, du wundersch√∂ne Stadt!" very well,
accompanied by a small orchestra.

"Hello, Katty, wie geht's?" said Hollis to a girl who was passing with a
tray of empty beer-glasses. She stopped. "Want some ice-cream, Katty?"

"Oh, come now, Mr. Hollis, you know there's no ice-cream here."

"Did I say here? Outside, of course. Come along."

Katty went, nothing loath.

She was a girl of sixteen, with bright eyes, thick braids of brown hair,
and a sweet voice; the fairness of extreme youth gave her a fictitious
innocence. He took her to the ephemeral saloon, and sat looking at her
while she devoured two large slabs of a violently pink tint; her
preposterous Gainsborough hat, with its imitation plumes, she had taken
off, and the flaring gas-light shone on her pretty face.

"Now shall we have a walk, Katty?"

They strolled through the streets for half an hour. He took her into a
jeweller's shop, and bought her a German-silver dog-collar which she had
admired in the window; she wanted it to clasp round her throat: "Close
up, you know, under the chin; it's so cute that way." She was profuse in
her thanks; of her own accord, when they came out, she took his arm.

He fell into silence. They passed his rooms; Katty looked up. "All
dark," she said.

"Yes. I guess I'll take you back now, Katty; do you want to go home, or
to the garden again?"

"I ain't accustomed to going to bed at this early hour, Mr. Hollis,
whatever you may be. I'll go back to the gardens, please."

When they reached the entrance, he put his hand in his pocket and drew
something out. "There, Katty, take that and buy more dog-collars.
Money's all an old fellow like me is good for."

"Oh, Mr. Hollis,--when I like you better than many that's young."

"Thank you, Katty. Good-night."

He went, as he would have called it, "home." On the way he passed his
office; a vague impulse made him unlock the door, and look in, by the
light of a match. The skeleton was there, and the bonnets in their
bandboxes. "I must try to work 'em off before winter," he thought; "they
are really elegant." He locked the door again, and, going a little
farther down the street, he entered an open hallway, and began to climb
a long flight of stairs. On the second floor he inserted his key in a
door, and, opening, entered; he was at home. The air was close and hot,
and he threw up the windows; leaving the candle in the outer room, he
went and sat down in his parlor, crossing his legs, and trying to lean
back; every chair in the room was in its very nature and shape
uncomfortable. Sitting there, his life in retrospect passed slowly
before him, like a picture unrolling itself on the dark wall; he saw all
the squalid poverty of it, all its disappointments, its deprivations.
"From first to last it's been a poor affair; I wonder how I've stood
it!" The dawn came into the room, he did not move; he sat there with his
hat on until the little bell of the Baptist church near by began to ring
for Sabbath-school. He listened to the sound for a while, it was
persistent; finally he got up; his legs felt stiff, he brushed some dust
from his trousers with the palm of his hand; then he went out.

He went down to the street, and thence to the Baptist church. The door
stood open, and he went in; the children were already in their places,
and the organ was sounding forth a lively tune; presently the young
voices began all together in a chorus,

    "The voice of free grace cries escape to the mount-ins--"

His mother used to sing that song, he remembered. She often sang it over
her work, and she was always at work--yes, to the very day of her death;
she was a patient, silent creature.

"I don't know that I'd oughter have less pluck than she had," thought
her son.

"Brother, will you have a book?" whispered a little man in a duster,
