"Yes, Euan."

I said, forcing myself to speak lightly:

"You are not to be afraid for us, Little Rosy Pigeon of the Forest.
Follow me with your swift-winged thoughts and no harm shall come to me."

"Must you go?"

I laughed: * "Ka-teri-oseres, Lois."

[* "I am going to this war, Lois."]

* "Wa-ka-ton-te-tsihon," she said calmly. "Wa-ka-ta-tiats-kon."

[* "I understand perfectly. I am resigned."]

Then I gave way to my increasing surprise:

"Wonder-child!" I exclaimed. "When and where have you learned to
understand and answer me in the tongue of the Long House?"

* "Kio-ten-se," she said with a faint smile.

[* "I am working for somebody."]

"For whom?"

"For my mother, Euan. Did you suppose I could neglect anything that
might be useful in my life's quest? Who knows when I might need the
tongue I am slowly learning to speak?... Oh, and I know so little, yet.
Something of Algonquin the Mohican taught me; and with it a little of
the Huron tongue. And now for nearly a month every day I have learned a
little from the Oneidas at Otsego--from the Oneida girl whose bridal
dress you bought to give to me. Do you remember her? The maid called
Drooping Wings?"

"Yes--but--I do not understand. To what end is all this? When and where
is your knowledge of the Iroquois tongue likely to aid you?"

She gave me a curious, veiled look--then turned her face away.

"You do not dream of following our army, do you?" I demanded. "Not one
woman would be permitted to go. It is utterly useless for you to expect
it, folly to dream of such a thing.... You and Lana are to go to Easton
as soon as the heavier artillery is sent down the river, which will be
the day we start--Friday. This frontier gypsying is ended--all this
coquetting with danger is over now. The fort here is no place for you
and Lana. Your visit, brief as it has been, is rash and unwarranted.
And I tell you very plainly, Lois, that I shall never rest until you
are at Easton, which is a stone town and within the borders of
civilization. The artillery will be sent down by boat, and all the
women and children are to go also. Neither Boyd nor I have told this to
you and Lana, but----" I glanced over my shoulder. "I think he is
telling her now."

Lois slowly turned and looked toward them. Evidently they no longer
cared what others saw or thought, for Lana's cheek lay pressed against
his shoulder, and his arm encircled her body.


We walked back, all together, to the fort, and left Lois and Lana at
the postern; then Boyd and I continued on to my bush-hut, the Indians
following.

Muffled drums of a regiment were passing, and an escort with reversed
arms, to bury poor Kimball, Captain in Colonel Cilly's command, shot
this morning through the heart by the accidental discharge of a musket
in the careless hands of one of his own men.

We stood at salute while the slow cortege passed.

Said Boyd thoughtfully:

"Well, Kimball's done with all earthly worries. There are those who
might envy him."

"You are not one," I said bluntly.

"I? No. I have not yet played hard enough in the jolly blind man's
