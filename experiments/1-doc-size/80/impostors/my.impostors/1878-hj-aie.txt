"I found him over there," said Willie Woodley, 
" and I told him you were here." 

And then Lord Lambeth, touching his hat a little, shook hands with Bessie. " Fancy your being 
here !" he said. He was blushing and smiling ; he 
looked very handsome, and he had a kind of splendor that he had not had in America. Bessie Alden 's imagination, as we know, was just then in exercise ; so that the tall young Englishman, as he 
stood there looking down at her, had the benefit 
of it. " He is handsomer and more splendid than 
any thing I have ever seen," she said to herself. 
And then she remembered that he was a Marquis, 
and she thought he looked like a Marquis. 

" I say, you know," he cried, " you ought to have 
let a man know you were here !" 

" I wrote to you an hour ago," said Mrs. West- 
gate. 

" Doesn't all the world know it ?" asked Bessie, 
smiling. 



  

" I assure you I didn 't know it !" cried Lord 
Lambeth. a Upon my honor I hadn 't heard of it.

"Should I, Woodley?" 

" Well, I guess not," said the young American. 

" Not even with my letter ?" asked Mrs. West- 
gate. 

" Ah, well, I haven 't got your letter yet ; I suppose I shall get it this evening. It was awfully 
kind of you to write." 

" So I said to Bessie," observed Mrs. Westgate. 

" Did she say so, Miss Alden ?" Lord Lambeth 
inquired. "I dare say you have been here a 
month." 

" We have been here three," said Mrs. West- 
gate. 





" Have you been here three months ?" the young 
man asked again of Bessie. 

" It seems a long time," Bessie answered. 

" I say, after that you had better not call me a 
humbug!" cried Lord Lambeth. "I have only 
been in town three weeks ; but you must have 
been hiding away ; I haven 't seen you any where." 

" Where should you have seen us where should
