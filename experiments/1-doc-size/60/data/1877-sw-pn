on that point. Some of us are rather wild." 

"Too big a subject for the present time and 
place," responded the referee of the little company. "To-morrow is Sunday; let us keep it for 
to-morrow, and come out here, or to some other 
place and discuss it." 

" That is delightful ! " cried Maggie clapping her 
hands. " Now what were some of the other things, 
Ditto?" 

"About the Saxons? But Mr. Murray did not 
hear our first story." 

" I know. I guess he knows. You do know 
about the old Saxons, don't you, Uncle Eden ? " 

" I know there was such a people." 

" And you know they were very good and very 
bad both at once; and we wanted to know how 
they could be so much worse, and yet so much 
better, than people nowadays." 

" How  so much better ' ? " 



 

"They told the truth, Uncle Eden." 

" There were no cowards and no marriage-break 
ers among them," Meredith added. 

" And then how ' so much worse ' ? " 

" they were cruel ! they offered human sacrifices; they were frightfully cruel." 

" Yes," said Mr. Murray thoughtfully, " the contrast seems strange. They were a noble people in 
many ways." 

"But Pastor Harms says they are not half so good 
now that they are Christians," Maggie went on. 

" If that is true, there must be a reason for it." 

" Yes, Uncle Eden ; of course." 

"And that reason cannot be found^in their Christianity." 

"But how is it, Uncle Eden?" 

" Human nature is very much alike at all times, 
my child." 

" But the old Saxons were not like the old Romans, Uncle Eden? the word of a Saxon was bet 
ter than a Roman's oath." 

" And the modern Saxons are not like their forefathers," said Meredith; "at least according to Pastor Harms."
