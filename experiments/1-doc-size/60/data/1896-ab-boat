I now fancied him changing sexes ; and 
as my eyes began to close in slumber, I 
imagined my fat landlord actually con- 
verted into as fat a landlady. However, 
sleep made but few changes in my situa- 
tion. The tavern, the apartment, and 
the table continued as before. Nothing 
suffered mutation but my host, who was 
fairly altered into a gentlewoman whom 
I knew to be Dame Quickly, mistress of 
this tavern in the days of Sir John ; and 
the liquor we were drinking seemed con- 
verted into sack and sugar. 

'' ' My dear Mrs. Quickly,' cried I (for 
I knew her perfectly well at first sight), 
'I am heartily glad to see you. How 
have you left Falstaff, Pistol, and the 
rest of our friends below stairs.? â€” brave 
and hearty, I hope ? ' " 

There was little left for Irving, the 
pioneer of England - loving Americans, 
but an hour of musing over past mirth, 
and a fruitful gossip (O that some crafty 
and unscrupulous listener could have 
written us down its story !) with a worthy

Saint Michael's Church, Crooked Lane. 
Now, not only had the back window of 
the inn looked out upon Saint Michael's

into the hands of the church ; the reve- 
nues of Bacchus thus reverting to the 
Establishment. Nothing therefore could 
be more natural than that Saint Michael's 
should preserve the counterfeit present- 
ment of its useful ward. But, though 
Irving betook himself there without 
delay, no such relic was forthcoming. 
Countless were the tombs of fishmon- 
gers therein, for Saint Michael's lived 
near neighbor to Billingsgate. There 
also were treasured the ashes of William 
Walworth, the doughty knight, most in- 
trepid of lord mayors, who smote Wat 
Tyler at Smithfield. In the little grave- 
yard adjoining the church stood the 
tombstone of honest Robert Preston, 
drawer of renown, doubtless the succes-
