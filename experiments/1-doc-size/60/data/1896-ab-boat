" Which are the nicest ? " asked we 
with the humility of the non-elect. 

" Mussels, miss ! " rang the concerted 
shout, whereupon tuppence each turned 
the loiterers into mussel-eating monarchs.

Two of US will never set eyes on the 
London barrows loaded with like marine 
delicacies without choking reminiscence 
of a certain expedition planned, gloated 
over in the night-watches and never ac- 
complished. For we had invited a lady 
of social high degree, who knows only 
poetic and fashionable London, and for 
whom the City is a myth, to vouchsafe 
us one day wherein to show her the 
World and the joys thereof. She should 
ride on the tops of 'buses, she should be 
presented to the Duke of SuflFolk's head, 
resident in the Minories, salute Gog and 
Magog, and pause before the tree " at the 
corner of Wood Street.'' But alas! in 
a moment of ill-judged prophecy we re- 
ferred to the mussels of Shoreditch to 
be purchased from a barrow and dipped 
in the public vinegar ; and being daintily 
nurtured, thenceforth she would none of 
our unholy pranks. 

Milk is no uncommon beverage, yet 
sometimes it has a taste of all Arcadia. 
One June day when we were on the 
march brought us to the Welsh paradise 
of Montgomery, where Magdalen Her- 
bert's castle heights are standing, crown- 
less, wonderful. We were entering the 
 

village foot-sore but never weary (and 
with no time for food, for there were 
many miles to tramp, that night, before 
we got home to our den, O) and there, 
providentially meeting us, came a clean 
woman driving a clean cow into a tidy 
yard. Never was bargain more swiftly 
sealed. She disappeared to bring two 
bright glasses and a quart measure. 
She milked and we, throned on a strip 
of turf, drank, while round about us 
thronged the village children, solemnly 
classifying two gaitered, short-skirted 
and apparently hollow monsters. That 
was milk such as they drink on Olympus 
when Hebe serves, though possibly only 
a cut above the draughts permanently on 
tap, for a penny or for love, at farm-house 
doors.
