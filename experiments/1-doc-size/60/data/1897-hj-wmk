me. I 'm going, but I must first understand. 
Have you lost it again ? " 

Maisie surveyed, for the idea of a partic- 
ular loss, the immensity of space. Then 
she replied lamely enough: "I feel as if I 
had lost everything." 

Mrs. Wix looked dark. "Do you mean 
to say you have lost what we found together, 
with so much difficulty, two days ago ? " As 
her pupil failed of response, she continued : 
" Do you mean to say you 've already for- 
gotten what we found together ? " 

Maisie dimly remembered. " My moral 
sense?" 

"Your moral sense. Haven't I, after all, 
brought it out ? " She spoke as she had never 
spoken even in the schoolroom and with the 
book in her hand. 

It brought back to the child a recollection 
of how sometimes she could n't repeat on 
Friday the sentence that had been glib on 
Wednesday, and she thought with conscious 
stupidity of the mystery on which she was 
now pulled up. Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale 
stood there like visitors at an "exam." 
She had indeed an instant a whiff of the 
faint flower that Mrs. Wix pretended to have 
plucked and now, with such a peremptory 





hand, passed under her nose. Then it left 
her, and, as if she were sinking with a slip 
from a foothold, her arms made a short jerk. 
What this jerk represented was the spasm 
within her of something still deeper than a 
moral sense. She looked at her examiner; 
she looked at the visitors ; she felt the ris- 
ing of the tears she had kept down at the 
station. The only thing was the old flat, 
shameful schoolroom plea. "I don't know 
I don't know." 

"Then you 've lost it." Mrs. Wix seemed 
to close the book as she fixed the straight- 
eners on Sir Claude. "You 've nipped it in 
the bud. You 've killed it when it had 
begun to live."
