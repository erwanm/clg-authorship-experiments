be comforted, for her sake ; reminded him that whatever 
other calamity had befallen him, they were still spared to 
one another; that their mutual affection remained un 
changed. 

"You are mine! mine only are you not?" he asked, 
suddenly lifting himself to look at her. " You gave yourself 



to me not because you believed another unfaithful, but be 
cause you loved me." 

" You know that I have always loved you, dearest !" 

She pressed her lips to the hot eyes, laid his head upon 
her bosom. 

" Do not think me weak, unmanly," he said gratefully. 
" But I had sat here all the night, surrounded by images of 
such horror ; beset by reflections so agonizing, that the reaction produced by your blessed companionship was too 
great. I shall not be overpowered again. You have done 
me good, my comforting angel! Poor child !" he continued, 
stroking the pallid face bowed over his. " You are worn 
out with watching and anxiety. I am a careless brute, who 
does not deserve such a wife." 

Her hand was upon his mouth and stopped the words. 

" I am not worn out ! I have had a long nap, and 
awaking, was alarmed to find how late it was ; became 
uneasy lest you might be sick, or some accident had happened, and came to look for you. This is the history of 
my intrusion." 

" Intrusion ! a welcome diversion ! I was under a spell, 
and might have remained here until dawn, without moving, 
had you not broken it." 

He was sitting upon the sofa, now, and pulled her, with 
gentle force, to his knee. As she complied with his wish, 
she saw his eye rest upon a pile of papers heaped in the 
middle of the table, and that a shuddering anguish, a fear 
ful look of sorrow and rage, went over his visage ; felt him 
tremble violently under her weight. 

" I cannot have you stay in this haunted chamber !" she 
said, in forced playfulness. " The influence of the unholy 
spell is upon you still, I see." 

" If I could tell you but no ! it would be cruel !" 

" To me do you mean ? If that withholds you from speak- 




ing freely, I can answer the objection. How often have 
you declared that I was the bravest girl in Christendom ? 
and I am your wife now, Aleck !"
