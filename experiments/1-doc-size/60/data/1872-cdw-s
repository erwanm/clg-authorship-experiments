FASHION IN THE STREETS. 

" ITAS there ever elsewhere such a blue, transparent 
sky as this here in Munich? At noon, looking 
up to it from the street, above the gray houses, the color 
and depth are marvellous. It makes a background for 
the Grecian art buildings and gateways, that would 
cheat a risen Athenian who should see it into the behef 
that he was restored to his beautiful city. The color 
holds, too, toward sundown, and seems to be poured, like 
something solid, into the streets of the city. 

You should see then the Maximilian Strasse, when the 
light floods the platz where Maximilian in bronze sits 
in his chair, illuminates the frescos on the pediments 
of the Hof Theatre, brightens the Pompeian red under 
the colonnade of the post-office, and streams down the 
gay thoroughfare to the trees and statues in front of the 
National Museum, and into the gold-dusted atmosphere 
beyond the Isar. The street is filled with promenaders : 
strangers who saunter alons; with the red book in one 
hand, â€” a man and his wife, the woman dragged reluc- 
tantly past the windows of fancy articles, which are " so 
cheap," the man breaking his neck to look up at the 
buildings, especially at the comical heads and figures in 
stone that stretch out from the little oriel-windows in 
the highest story of the Four-Seasons Hotel, and look 
down upon the moving throng ; Munich bucks in coats 
of velvet, swinging; ligbt canes, and smoking cigars 
through long and elaborately-carved meerschaum hold- 
ers ; Munich ladies in dresses of that inconvenient length 


tliat neither sweeps the pavement nor clears it ; peasants 

from the Tyrol, the men in black, tight breeches, that 

button from the knee to the ankle, short jackets and 

vests set thickly with round silver buttons, and conical 

-hats with feathers, and the women in short quilted and 

quilled petticoats, of barrel-like roundness from the 

broad hips down, short waists ornamented with chains 

and barbarous brooches of white metal, with the oddest 

head-gear of gold and silver heirlooms ; students with 

little red or green embroidered brimless caps, with the 

ribbon across the breast, a folded shawl thrown over one 

shoulder, and the inevitable switch-cane ; porters in red
