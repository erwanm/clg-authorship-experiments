trin Ir," her mother began in an amiable tone that to her 
ear had a smothered anger in it. 

" Yes, you might about as well say Europe to me as 
Maine, ' ' announced that gentleman. "I've had an idea all 
along that it was up northeast, and freezing cold ten months 
of the year, with miles and miles of pine barrens and timber 
of various sorts. The idea of any one going off there 
when there was Cape May and Atlantic City, and Long 
Branch if you want to go north, and all Delaware and 
Maryland shore. But I declare, I said to Agnes, your 
letters beat me all out. You were not drawing on your 
imagination now, were you ? " 

"The half has not been told," Gertrude began with 
an effort at gayety. ' ' You see the world is so large and 
there are a great many people in it. They search for 
pleasure as well as gold and diamonds. They go up to 
Alaska and over to Africa, so why shouldn't those who do 
not care so much for the gold and diamonds have the 
pleasure? " 

"Well — I s'pose it must be pleasure to them, but I 
don't believe I'd care for it. And you mean to say that 
Maine is like — like " 

"It is beautiful, all the long coast dotted with islands 
and bays and points and vessels of every kind, yachts in 
gala array, steamboats flying to and fro, fishing boats, 
until it looks as if half the world had gathered there on 
a picnic. And Mount Desert Island is just full of society 
people with hotels and cottages." 

" Well ! well ! I can't get over it. I've always stayed 
at home, though I did once go to New York, but every- 
thing seemed dreadful high, and Maria, she thought 
'twas such an awful wicked city. But she wouldn't even 
go to Philadelphia. I think Maria did get to be awful 





close in those last years. And I've about made up my 
mind to enjoy life, but I don't believe I want to go gali- 
vantin' around in strange places very much. A good 
home is about my idea of comfort." 

" A good home is an excellent thing for a man, and 
especially for a woman. Parents die and old homes must 
be broken up, so it is wisdom to form the new ones. I 
have no patience with the new education of girls that 
makes them clerks and telegraph operators and what not, 
and leaves them utterly incompetent to manage a home. 
I mean that my girls shall know how to make the men 
they marry happy and comfortable."
