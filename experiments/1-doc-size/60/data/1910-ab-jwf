we feel at one with life was stealing over her; but she was 
really sleepy with the liberty to indulge it. 

" I can't," said Tim decisively, frowning at the fire. 

"Oh, yes, I guess you can. Why can't you?" 

" Father ain't a practical man. I 've got to have practical 
men go in with me, and I 've got to have some money to 
keep up my end." 

" Your language doesn't always please me, Timmy," said 
his mother, without severity, conscious of the warmth of the 
fire on her knees. " I am surprised that a young man of your 
antecedents and training should find the slightest temptation 
to say ' ain't.'" 

"The amount of it is," Timmy continued, " we want money. 
We need it, mum. We need it mighty bad." 

" The rich man is not the man to be envied," said Mrs.

" Look at dad,' said Tim in dispassionate argument. " Did

"Ambitious! I shouldn't think he was. He's been 
squeezed so hard the blood 's all out of him. He ain't am- 
bitious nor anything else. He 's got four kids to put through 
college: no, three, â€” Tonty 's only a girl. She'll probably 
marry." 

"Antoinette will assuredly have a collegiate course whether 
she is a girl or not," said his mother, with some severity due 
to her tenets of belief. She had almost concluded, " whether 
she wants it or not," because she knew that, as a matter of 
principle, Tonty would have to enter the world sufficiently 
equipped. 

" Well, Tonty is a girl," said Tim. " Count her in then. 
Four kids to educate. How 's he going to do it ? Don't count 
me. I didn't want to go to college, and I did n't. I think 
I 'm a polished specimen as I am, don't you, mum?" 

" You seem to forget that your mother's lectures are re- 
munerative," she reminded him.
