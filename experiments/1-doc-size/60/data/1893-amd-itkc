"Would Thursday suit you ? " he asked. "I 
will come over with my lawyer. I will send to 
Mr. Vantine to-day." 



"Very well." She left him at the end of the 
hall. He found when he stepped out on the sun- 
shiny porch that he was alone. But Pearl Dis- 
browe came and gave him a welcoming smile that 
kindled a sudden warmth in every pulse. 

" Am I to congratulate you ? "she asked. 

" That I have won back my birthright ? No ; 
let me be honest,' and he took the hand so cor- 
dially outstretched, while a smile answered hers, 
that illumined his face, — a smile no one had ever 
seen there before, and he was unconscious of the 
great gladness it expressed. " We were all in the 
wrong, and the Eastwoods were right. But my 
father believed it otherwise, and lived up to his 
belief. Still, he would never have touched a dol- 
lar of another man's money or his goods. He was 
a sternly upright man, and blinded by his great 
love for what he had been trained to consider his. 
But I am grateful to your friend ; " he glanced 
from one to the other. 

Pearl colored vividly, and there was a fascinat- 
ing softness in her eyes. 

" I am very glad for your sake." 

They turned into the old paths. What was 
there about this woman, that could touch the 
edges of awkwardness and straightway glorify 
them into friendly converse ? She moved him with 
a strange sympathy ; she had such a love for the 




simple things of nature. If the fair ghost of his 
mother could come back — but this one had a 
more radiant beauty. Yes, he would always be 
glad she had been here. There would be two 
ghosts to call up in this old garden. Of course 
Olmstead meant to marry her — perhaps they 
would both come and partake of the cheer by his 
fireside. 

Pearl found Miss Eastwood in her room when 
the two men were gone. 

" Oh," she cried, throwing herself on the has- 
sock and leaning her arms on Sabrina's knee, " do 
you repent ? Have I persuaded you against your 
will, your better judgment ? "
