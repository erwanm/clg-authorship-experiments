up in a balloon with a genius. We got to talking 
together. 

There was one thing that kept bothering me, 
and by-and-by I says : 

' Tom, didn't we start East ? ' 

' Yes.' 

'How fast have we been going ? ' 

' Well, you heard what the professor said when 
he was raging around ; sometimes, he said, we was 
making fifty miles an hour, sometimes ninety, 
sometimes a hundred ; said that with a gale to help 
he could make three hundred any time, and said if 
he wanted the gale, and wanted it blowing the 
right direction, he only had to go up higher or 
down lower and find it.' 

'Well, then it's just as I reckoned. The pro- 
fessor lied.' 

' Why ? ' 

' Because if we was going so fast we ought to be 
past Illinois, oughtn't we ? ' 
' Certainly.' 
' Well, we ain't.' 
' What's the reason we ain't ? ' 

'I know by the colour. We're right over Illinois 
yet. And you can see for yourself that Indiana 
ain't in sight.' 

' I wonder what's the matter with you, Huck. 
You know by the colour ? ' 
' Yes â€” of course I do.' 
' What's the colour got to do with it ? ' 
' It's got everything to do with it. Illinois is 

green, Indiana is pink. You show me any pink 
down here if you can. Nro, sir ; it's green.' 

'Indiana pink ? Why, what a lie ! ' 

' It ain't no lie ; I've seen it on the map, and 
it's pink.' 

You never see a person so aggravated and dis- 
gusted. He says : 

' Well, if I was such a numskull as you, Huck 
Finn, I would jump over. Seen it on the map ! 
Huck Finn, did you reckon the States was the 
same colour out of doors that they are on the map ? ' 

 Tom Sawyer, what's a map for ? Ain't it to 
learn you facts ? '
