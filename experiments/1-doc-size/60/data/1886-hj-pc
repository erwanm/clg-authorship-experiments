legged stool, or some hideous hob-nailed boot, had been shied 
at him. The room surged round, heaving up and down, while 
he was conscious of a loud explosion of laughter and scorn ; 
of cries of ' Order, order ! ' of some clear word of Muni- 
ment's, ' I say, Delancey, just step down ; ' of Eustache 
Poupin shouting out, ' Vous insultez le peuple vous insultez 
le peuple ! ' of other retorts, not remarkable for refinement. 
The next moment Hyacinth found that he had sprung up 
on a chair, opposite to the barber, and that at the sight of 
so rare a phenomenon the commotion had suddenly 
checked itself. It was the first time he had asked the 
ear of the company, and it was given on the spot. He 
was sure, he looked very white, and it was even possible 
they could see him tremble. He could only hope that 
this didn't make him ridiculous when he said, 'I don't 
think it's right of him to say that. There are others, 
besides him. At all events, I want to speak for myself: it 
may do some good ; I can't help it. I'm not afraid ; I'm 
very sure I'm not. I'm ready to do anything that will do 
any good; anything, anything I don't care a rap. In 
such a cause I should like the idea of danger. I don't 
consider my bones precious in the least, compared with 
some other things. If one is sure one isn't afraid, and 
one is accused, why shouldn't one say so ? ' 

It appeared to Hyacinth that he was talking a long 
time, and when it was over he scarcely knew what happened. 
He felt himself, in a moment, down almost under the feet 
of the other men ; stamped upon with intentions of ap- 
plause, of familiarity ; laughed over and jeered over, 



 

hustled and poked in the ribs. He felt himself also 
pressed to the bosom of Eustache Poupin, who apparently 
was sobbing, while he heard some one say, ' Did ye hear 
the little beggar, as bold as a lion ? ' A trial of personal 
prowess between him and Mr. Delancey was proposed, 
but somehow it didn't take place, and at the end of five 
minutes the club-room emptied itself, not, evidently, to be 
reconstituted, outside, in a revolutionary procession. Paul 
Muniment had taken hold of Hyacinth, and said, 'I'll 
trouble you to stay, you little desperado. I'll be blowed if 
I ever expected to see you on the stump ! ' Muniment 
remained, and M. Poupin and Mr. Schinkel lingered in 
their overcoats, beneath a dim, surviving gasburner, in 
the unventilated medium in which, at each renewed 
gathering, the Bloomsbury club seemed to recognise itself. 

' Upon my word, I believe your game,' said Muniment, 
looking down at him with a serious face. 

' Of course you think it's swagger, " self -loaf," as 
Schinkel says. But it isn't.' Then Hyacinth asked, ' In 
God's name, why don't we do something ? ' 

'Ah, my child, to whom do you say it?' Eustache 
Poupin exclaimed, folding his arms, despairingly.
