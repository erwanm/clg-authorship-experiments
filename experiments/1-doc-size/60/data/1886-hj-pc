has kept her, and she's ashamed of it. When we are alone 
Assunta comes for her bonnet. But she likes you to think 
she waits on herself.' 

' That's a weakness when she's so strong ! And what 
does Assunta think of it ? ' Hyacinth asked, looking at the 
stuffed birds in the window, the alabaster Cupid, the wax 
flowers on the chimney-piece, the florid antimacassars on 
the 'chairs, the sentimental engravings on the walls in 
frames of papier-mache and ' composition,' some of them 
enveloped in pink tissue-paper and the prismatic glass 
pendants which seemed attached to everything. 

'She says, "What on earth will it matter to-morrow?'" 

' Does she mean that to-morrow the Princess will have her 
luxury back again ? Hasn't she sold all her beautiful things ?' 

Madame Grandoni was silent a moment. 'She has 
kept a few. They are put away.' . 

' A la bonne heure ! ' cried Hyacinth, laughing. He sat 
down with the ironical old woman ; he spent nearly half 
an hour in desultory conversation with her, before candles 
were brought in, and while Christina was in Assunta's 
hands. He noticed how resolutely the Princess had 
withheld herself from any attempt to sweeten the dose she 
had taken it into her head to swallow, to mitigate the 
ugliness of her vulgar little house. She had respected its 
horrible idiosyncrasies, and left, rigidly, in their places the 
gimcracks which found favour in Madeira Crescent. She 
had flung no draperies over the pretentious furniture and

plainly her theory that the right way to acquaint one's self 
with the sensations of the wretched was to suffer the anguish 
of exasperated taste. Presently a female servant came in 
not the sceptical Assunta, but a stunted young woman 
of the maid-of-all-work type, the same who had opened the 
door to the pair a short time before and informed Hyacinth 
that the Princess wished him to understand that he was 
expected to remain to tea. He learned from Madame 
Grandoni that the custom of an early dinner, followed in 
the evening by the frugal repast of the lower orders, was 
another of Christina's mortifications; and when, shortly 
afterwards, he saw the table laid in the back parlour, which 
was also the dining-room, and observed the nature of the 
crockery with which it was decorated, he perceived that 
whether or no her earnestness were durable, it was at any 
rate, for the time, intense. Madame Grandoni narrated to 
him, definitely, as the Princess had done only in scraps, 
the history of the two ladies since his departure from 
Medley, their relinquishment of that fine house and the 
sudden arrangements Christina had made to change her 
mode of life, after they had been only ten days in South 
Street. At the climax of the London season, in a society 
which only desired to treat her as one of its brightest orna-
