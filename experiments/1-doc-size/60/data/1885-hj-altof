suffer from a modern form of inhumanity. The mis 
tress of the little inn at the base of the castle-rock 
it stands very pleasantly beside the river, and we had 
breakfasted there declared to us that the Chateau de 
Chaumont, which is often during the autumn closed 
to visitors, was at that particular moment standing so 
wide open to receive us that it was our duty Co hire 
one of her carriages and drive thither with speed. 
This assurance was so satisfactory that we presently 
found ourselves seated in this wily woman 's most com 
modious vehicle, and rolling, neither too fast nor too 
slow, along the margin of the Loire. The drive of 
about an hour, beneath constant clumps of chestnuts, 
was charming enough to have been taken for itself; 
and indeed, when we reached Chaumont, we saw that 
our reward was to be simply the usual reward of 
virtue, the consciousness of having attempted the 



  

right. The Chateau de Chaumont was inexorably 
closed; so we learned from a talkative lodge-keeper, 
who gave what grace she could to her refusal. This 
good woman 's dilemma was almost touching; she 
wished to reconcile two impossibles. The castle was 
not to be visited, for the family of its master was 
staying there; and yet she was loath to turn away a 
party of which she was good enough to say that it had 
a grand genre; for, as she also remarked, she had her 
living to earn. She tried to arrange a compromise, 
one of the elements of which was that we should 
descend from our carriage and trudge up a hill which 
would bring us to a designated point, where, over the 
paling of the garden, we might obtain an oblique and 
surreptitious view of a small portion of the castle walls. 
This suggestion led us to inquire (of each other) to 
what degree of baseness it is allowed to an enlightened 
lover of the picturesque to resort, in order to catch a 
glimpse of a feudal chateau. One of our trio decided, 
characteristically, against any form of derogation; so 
she sat in the carriage and sketched some object that 
was public property, while her two companions, who 
were not so proud, trudged up a muddy ascent which 
formed a kind of back-stairs. It is perhaps no more 
than they deserved that they were disappointed. Chau 
mont is feudal, if you please; but the modern spirit is 
in possession. It forms a vast clean-scraped mass, 
with big round towers, ungarnished with a leaf of ivy 
or a patch of moss, surrounded by gardens of moderate 
extent (save where the muddy lane of which I speak 





passes near it), and looking rather like an enormously 
magnified villa. The great merit of Chaumont is its 
position, which almost exactly resembles that of Am-
