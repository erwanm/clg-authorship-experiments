urban dinner. Vaucluse has been turned to account, 
however, not only by sentiment, but by industry; the 
banks of the stream being disfigured by a pair of 
hideous mills for the manufacture of paper and of 
wool. In an enterprising and economical age the 
water-power of the Sorgues was too obvious a motive; 
and I must say that, as the torrent rushed past them, 
the wheels of the dirty little factories appeared to turn 
merrily enough. The footpath on the left bank, of 
which I just spoke, carries one, fortunately, quite out 
of sight of them, and out of sound as well, inasmuch 
as on the day of my visit the stream itself, which was 
in tremendous force, tended more and more, as one 
approached the fountain, to fill the valley with its own 
echoes. Its color was magnificent, and the whole 
spectacle more like a corner of Switzerland than a 
nook in Provence. The protrusions of the mountain 
shut it in, and you penetrate to the bottom of the re- 





cess which they form. The Sorgues rushes and rushes; 
it is almost like Niagara after the jump of the cataract. 
There are dreadful little booths beside the path, for 
the sale of photographs and immortelles  I don't know 
what one is to do with the immortelles, where you 
are offered a brush dipped in tar to write your name 
withal on the rocks. Thousands of vulgar persons , of 
both sexes, and exclusively, it appeared, of the French 
nationality, had availed themselves of this implement; 
for every square inch of accessible stone was scored 
over with some human appellation. It is not only we 
in America, therefore, who besmirch our scenery; the 
practice exists, in a more organized form (like every 
thing else in France), in the country of good taste. 
You leave the little booths and stalls behind; but the 
bescribbled crag, bristling with human vanity, keeps 
you company even when you stand face to face with 
the fountain. This happens when you find yourself 
at the foot of the enormous straight cliff out of which 
the river gushes. It rears itself to an extraordinary 
height, a huge forehead of bare stone, lacking as 
if it were the half of a tremendous mound, split open 
by volcanic action. The little valley, seeing it there, 
at a bend, stops suddenly, and receives in its arms 
the magical spring. I call it magical on account of 
the mysterious manner in which it comes into the 
world, with the huge shoulder of the mountain rising 
over it, as if to protect the secret. From under the 
mountain it silently rises, without visible movement, 
filling a small natural basin with the stillest blue 



  

water. The contrast between the stillness of this basin 
and the agitation of the water directly after it has
