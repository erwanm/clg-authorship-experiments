the sun beat in so on our backs that we were obliged to have 
the curtain down. Thus we were as uncognizant of the 
scenery we passed through as if we had been nailed up in a 
box. Nothing but the consideration that we were travelling 
for pleasure could for a moment have reconciled us to such 
inconveniences. As it was, I occasionally called out to C, in 
the back carriage, to be sure and take good care of the fur 
coat ; which always brought shouts of laughter from the whole 
party. The idea of a fur coat seemed .so supremely ridiculous 
to us, there was no making us believe we ever should or 
could want it. 







That was the most unpleasant day's ride I had in the Alps. 
"We stopped to take dinner in the little wretched village of 
Liddes. You have no idea what a disagreeable, unsavory 
concern one of these villages is. Houses, none of which look 
much better than the log barns in our "Western States, set close 
together on either side of a street paved with round stones ; 
coarse, sunburnt women, with their necks enlarged by the 
goitre ; and dirty children, with tangled hair, and the same 
disgusting disease, — these were the principal features of the 
scene. 

This goitre prevails so extensively in this region, that you 
seldom see a person with the neck in a healthy condition. 
The worst of the matter is, that in many cases of children it 
induces idiocy. Cases of this kind were so frequent, that, 
after a while, whenever I met a child, I began to search in its 
face for indications of the approach of this disease. 

They are called cretins. In many cases the whole head 
appears swelled and deformed. As usual, every one you look 
at puts out the hand to beg. The tavern where we stopped 
to dine seemed more like a great barn, or cavern, than any 
thing else. We go groping along perfectly dark stone passages, stumbling up a stone staircase, and gaining light only 
when the door of a kind of reception room opens upon us — a 
long, rough-looking room, without any carpet, furnished with 
a table, and some chairs, and a rude sofa. "We were shown 
to a bed room, carpetless, but tolerably clean, with a very 
high feather bed in each corner, under a canopy of white 
curtains. 

After dinner we went on towards St. Pierre, a miserable 
hamlet, where the mules were taken out of the chars, and we 
prepared to mount them. 







It was between three and four o'clock. Our path lav up a 
desolate mountain gorge. After we had ascended some way
