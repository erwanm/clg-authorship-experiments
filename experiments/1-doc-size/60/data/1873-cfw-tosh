them plaguey hills neither,' said number two. 
' Well, now ! this is what I call a be-a-utiful 
country ! Western farmers must have an easy 
life of it.' You can imagine with what feelings 
I listened to these men. There I was, longing 
for the sight of a hill with the longing of a 
homesick child for its mother." 

" I am afraid you are prejudiced, George," 
said Mr. Leslie, with a smile. " You dwell upon 
the heat of August in Ohio, but you say nothing 
about the other eleven months of the year." 

" The other eleven months are beautiful, I 
must acknowledge," replied Mr. Vinton. " As 
soon as the frosts come, nothing can surpass the 
climate ; colored October, hazy November, and 
bright, open December are all perfect. Any 
New Englander, — even you, Mr. Gay, — would 
be obliged to yield the palm to the West in re- 
spect of winter climate." 



 

" No sir," replied the Boston bachelor emphat- 
ically ; "I would yield no palm under any cir- 
cumstances. I even prefer a Boston east wind 
to the mildest western zephyr." 

" Oh, you are prejudiced ! " said Bessie, 
laughing. 

" Of course I am, Miss Darrell. It is a 
characteristic of Massachusetts Bay. We do 
not deny it, — on the contrary we are rather 
proud of it." 

Thus, in many conversations, the dog-days 
passed along. 

" It seems to me we do nothing but talk," 
said Bessie, after a long evening on the piazza 
with several visitors. 

" The dog-days were intended for conversa- 
tion," said Hugh. " Our hands and our brains 
are busily employed all the rest of the year, but 
when the thermometer gets up into the nineties, 
the tongue talks its share and gives the other 
members a rest." 

" I hope you don't mean to insinuate that our 



 

brains are not employed in our conversation,"
