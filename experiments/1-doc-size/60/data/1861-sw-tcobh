return and come to Zion, with songs and 
everlasting joy upon their heads.’ ” 

“And Zionward means towards Zion,” 
said Debby. “I know that.” 



“Yes,” said her mother: “these little 
travellers have heard that the Lord hath 
founded Zion, and so they have chosen 
it for their home. Every day they are 
travelling on towards it, and there Jesus has 
a crown for each one of them.” 

“I guess they walk well, then,” said 
Debby, “since they’re going to such a 
good place.” 

“One who is really travelling towards 
Zion, with his face thitherwards, Debby,” 
said her mother, “walks as no one else 
can ! In the first place, he walks in safety ; 
for ‘ the Lord keepeth the feet of his 
saints.’ If they trust in him, ‘their feet 
shall not slip.’ Sin shall neither conquer 
nor mislead them.” 

“Don’t they ever want to do wrong?” 
said Debby. 

“Sin may tempt them sometimes,” said 
her mother; “but if they pray, — ‘Teach


 


me thy way, O Lord; lead me in a plain 
path, because of mine enemies — then the 
Lord will answer them, ‘ This is the way : 
walk ye in it.’ None of the attacks 
of sin shall hurt them; for the Lord 
is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.” 

“And what then ?” said Debby. 

“Why, then/’ said her mother, “they 
walk in the way of peace and in the light 
of God’s countenance.” 

“And that makes them shine,” said 
Debby. “I remember all about my little 
stone.” 

“Yes, that makes them shine,” said her 
mother. “And so, with this glory about 
them and in their hearts, they walk in the 
fear of the Lord, and in love towards them 
that are without, redeeming the time.
