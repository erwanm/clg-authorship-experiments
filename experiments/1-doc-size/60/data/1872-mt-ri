tors talk about only three things — " Californy," the Nevada 
silver mines, and this desperado Slade. And a deal the most 
of the talk was about Slade. We had gradually come to have 
a realizing sense of the fact that Slade was a man whose heart 
and hands and soul were steeped in the blood of offenders 
against his dignity ; a man who awfully avenged all injuries, 
affronts, insults or slights, of whatever kind — on the spot if he 
could, years afterward if lack of earlier opportunity compelled 
it ; a man whose hate tortured him day and night till ven- 
geance appeased it — and not an ordinary vengeance either, 
but his enemy's absolute death — nothing less; a man whose 
face would light up with a terrible joy when he surprised a 
foe and had him at a disadvantage. A high and efficient 
servant of the Overland, an outlaw among outlaws and yet 
their relentless scourge, Slade was at once the most bloody, 
the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen that inhab- 
ited the savage fastnesses of the mountains.

REALLY and truly, two thirds of the talk of drivers and 
conductors had been about this man Slade, ever since 
the day before we reached Julesburg. In order that the east' 
em reader may have a clear conception of what a Kocky Moun 
tain desperado is, in his highest state of development, I will 
reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one straightforward 
narrative, and i3resent it in the following shape : 

Slade was born in Illinois, of good parentage. At about 
twenty-six years of age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled 
the country. At St. Joseph, Missouri, he joined one of the 
early California-bound emigrant trains, and was given the post 
of train-master. One day on the plains he had an angry dispute 
with one of his wagon-drivers, and both drew their 
revolvers. Cut the driver was the quicker artist, and had his 
weapon cocked first. So Slade said it was a pity to waste hfe 
on so small a matter, and proposed that the pistols be thrown 
on the ground and the quarrel settled by a fist-fight. The 
unsuspecting driver agreed, and threw down his pistol — where- 
upon Slade laughed at his simplicity, and shot him dead ! 

He made his escape, and lived a wild life for awhile, divid- 
ing his time between fighting Indians and avoiding an Illinois 
sherifi", who had been sent to arrest him for his first murder. 
It is said that in one Indian battle he killed three savages with 
his own hand, and afterward cut their ears ofif and sent them, 
with his compliments, to the chief of the tribe. 

Slade soon gained a name for fearless resolution, and this 
was sufficient merit to procure for him the important post of 
overland division-agent at Julesburg, in place of Mr. Jules, 
removed. For some time previously, the company's horses 
had been frequently stolen, and the coaches delayed, by 
gangs of outlaws, who were wont to 
laugh at the idea of any man's having 
the temerity to resent such outrages. 
Slade resented them 
promptly. The out-
