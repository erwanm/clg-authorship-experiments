the good work done by Cervantes is pretty nearly a 
dead letter, so effectually has Scott’s pernicious work 
undermined it. 


CHAPTER XLVII. 

“UNCLE REMUS” AND MR CABLE 

M R. JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS (" Uncle Re- 
mus”) was to arrive from Atlanta at seven 
o’clock Sunday morning ; so we got up and received 
him. We were able to detect him among the crowd of 
arrivals at the hotel-counter by his correspondence 
with a description of him which had been furnished us 
from a trustworthy source. He was said to be under- 
sized, red-haired, and somewhat freckled. Pie was the 
only man in the party whose outside tallied with this 
bill of particulars. He was said to be very shy. He 
is a shy man. Of this there is no doubt. It may not 
show on the surface, but the shyness is there. After 
days of intimacy one wonders to see that it is still in 
about as strong force as ever. There is a fine and 
beautiful nature hidden behind it, as all know who have 
read the “Uncle Remus” book; and a fine genius, 
too, as all know by the same sign. I seem to be talk- 
ing quite freely about this neighbor; but in talking to 
the public I am but talking to his personal friends and 
these things are permissible among friends. 

He deeply disappointed a number of children who 
had flocked eagerly to Mr. Cable’s house to get a 
glimpse of the illustrious sage and oracle of the nation’s 
nurseries. They said : 

“ Why, he’s white !” 



They were grieved about it. So, to console them, 
the book was brought, that they might hear Uncle 
Remus' Tar-Baby story from the lips of Uncle Remus 
himself — or what, in their outraged eyes, was left of 
him. But it turned out that he had never read aloud 
to people, and was too shy to venture the attempt 
now. Mr. Cable and I read from books of ours, to 
show him what an easy trick it was ; but his immortal 
shyness was proof against even this sagacious strategy ; 
so we had to read about Brer Rabbit ourselves. 

Mr. Harris ought to be able to read the negro dialect 
better than anybody else, for in the matter of writing 
it he is the only master the country has produced. 
Mr. Cable is the only master in the writing of French 
dialects that the country has produced ; and he reads 
them in perfection. It was a great treat to hear him 
read about Jean-ah Poquelin, and about Innerarity and 
his famous " pigshoo " representing " Louisihanna 
i?z-fusing to Hanter the Union," along with passages 
of nicely-shaded German dialect from a novel which
