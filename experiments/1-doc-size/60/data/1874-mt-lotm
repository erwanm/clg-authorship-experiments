'' Yes, before you got half through telling about the 
thing, I knew perfectly well who the boy was ; it was 
BenCoontz!” 

I came out of my collapse as one who rises from the 
dead. I said, with admiration : 

“Why, how in the world did you ever guess it?” 

“ You told me in your sleep.” 

I said to myself, “ How splendid that is! This is a 
habit which must be cultivated.” 

My brother rattled innocently on : 

“When you were talking in your sleep, you kept 
mumbling something about 4 matches,’ which I couldn’t 
make anything out of ; but just now, when you began 
to tell me about the man and the calaboose and the 
matches, I remembered that in your sleep you men- 
tioned Ben Coontz two or three times ; so I put this 
and that together, you see, and right away I knew it 
was Ben that burnt that man up.” 

I praised his sagacity effusively. Presently he asked : 

“ Are you going to give him up to the law?” 

“No,” I said, “I believe that this will be a lesson 
to him. I shall keep an eye on him, of course, for 
that is but right; but if he stops where he is and re- 
forms, it shall never be said that I betrayed him.” 

” How good you are !” 

” Well, I try to be. It is all a person can do in a 
world like this.” 

And now, my burden being shifted to other shoul- 
ders, my terrors soon faded away. 

The day before we left Hannibal, a curious thing 
fell under my notice — the surprising spread which 
longitudinal time undergoes there. I learned it from 
one of the most unostentatious of men — the colored 
coachman of a friend of mine, who lives three miles 
from town. He was to call for me at the Park Hotel 
at 7.30 P. M., and drive me out. But he missed it 


considerably — did not arrive till ten. He excused 
himself by saying: 

“ De time is mos’ an* hour en a half slower in de 
country en what it is in de town ; you’ll be in plenty 
time, boss. Sometimes we shoves out early for 
church, Sunday, en fetches up dah right plum in de 
middle er de sermon. Diffunce in de time. A body 
can’t make no calculations ’bout it.”
