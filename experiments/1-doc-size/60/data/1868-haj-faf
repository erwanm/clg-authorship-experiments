interest in him. That was the secret of his better thoughts and
purposes.

On the whole, I begin to think there is hope for Micky.




CHAPTER XXIII.

FAME AND FORTUNE.


Mr. Gilbert chanced to be looking out of the window of Mr. Rockwell's
counting-room, when he was unpleasantly surprised by the sudden
apparition of Micky Maguire. He was destined to be still more
unpleasantly surprised. Micky walked up to the main entrance, and
entered with an assured air. Gilbert hastened to meet him, and prevent
his entrance.

"Clear out of here, you young rascal!" he said, in a tone of authority.
"You're not wanted here."

"I've come on business," said Micky, with a scowl of dislike, showing no
intention of retreating.

"I have no business with you," said Gilbert.

"Perhaps you haven't," said Micky, "but Mr. Rockwell has."

"Mr. Rockwell will have nothing to say to a vagabond like you."

"He told me to come," said Micky, resolutely, "and I shan't go till I've
seen him."

Gilbert did not believe this, but suspected that Micky intended to
betray him, and to this of course he had a decided objection.

"Go out!" he said, imperiously, "or I'll make you."

"I won't then," said Micky, defiantly.

"We'll see about that."

Gilbert seized him by the shoulders; but Micky was accustomed to
fighting, and made a vigorous resistance. In the midst of the fracas Mr.
Rockwell came up.

"What does this mean?" he demanded, in a quiet but authoritative tone.

"This young rascal has attempted to force his way in," said the
book-keeper, desisting, and with a flushed face.

"I asked to see you," said Micky, "and he said I shouldn't."

"I told him to come," said Mr. Rockwell. "You may come into the
counting-room, Michael. Mr. Gilbert, I should like your presence also."

In surprise, not unmingled with foreboding, Mr. Gilbert followed his
employer and Micky Maguire into the counting-room.
