She shrugged her dainty shoulders and looked at the westering sun above
Staten Island; and in the gesture she seemed, in pantomime, to discard
all feminine duties, cares, and responsibilities forever.  Then as she
rested there, cheek on hand, her blue eyes grew vaguer.
"I am glad you came into our lives," she said; "I mean it this time."
"I am glad, too," he said seriously.
"You are now; I can see that....  How soon will you be sorry?"
"Why?"
She turned toward him.
"How soon will the novelty tire you?"
"I have not considered you as a novelty."
"But I am; I’m a mechanical toy.  My paint soon comes off, cousin."
"You’re my own kin.  There’s no novelty, as you call it, in kinship,
nothing evanescent."
She said: "Do you really and deliberately desire to stand by that
extremely tenuous and attenuated tie?  An attitude of that sort entails
duties.  You may have much to overlook in us—even much to forgive.  Are
you aware of your responsibilities?"
"I assumed them when I asked to be admitted to your partnership."
"Why did you ask to join?"
"The real reason?"
She hesitated, looking at him.
"Yes, the real one."
"You."
"What exactly do you mean by that answer?"
"I don’t know, myself, Japonette," he said laughingly; "I’ve tried to
analyze it, too.  The instinct of relationship may have counted."
"I hope it did," said she.
"I hope so.  God knows, and men are selfish.... And that counted,
too."
"What?"
"Selfishness."
"I don’t believe there is very much in you."
"That is where your heart is still a child’s heart, Japonette."
"Oh, I’m no altruist, but there’s selfishness and selfishness....
What were we talking about?  Oh! why you desired to join——"
"No, we got past that."
"Oh, yes; well, then, you say it was because of me.  Why?"
"I told you I didn’t know exactly why; but the root of it all was
you....  And when you told me about some people who had come here—that
fellow who spoke about a housekeeper——"
"Jim Edgerton!"
"What!"
"I believe—but you can’t be as nice as that! You simply can’t!"
"Oh, I’m not nice," he protested, reddening; but she interrupted:
"You are!  I certainly believe you thought that Silvie and I required
somebody masculine in our vicinity—to throw the housekeeping man
downstairs, for example.  Did you?"
"No.  I only——"
"Did you?"
"Of course not."
"Do you know," she said seriously, "you’re a perfect dear in one way,
and I don’t know what you are in others.  Now be flattered, for that
makes you interesting.  And you know it’s all up with a woman who finds
a man interesting."
She was laughing at him now, and he scarcely knew how to take what she
said except to take it with a grin.
"You’re a terrible torment, Diana," he said. "My value in my own
estimation, since I’ve known you, has fluctuated between a dollar and a
half and thirty cents."
