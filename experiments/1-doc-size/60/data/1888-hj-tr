wasn 't in the least what she wanted. She amplified 
this statement very soon at least as regards her 
interpretation of Mr. Flack s designs : a certain 
mystery still hung about her own, which, as she 
intimated, had much more to recommend them. 
Delia s vision of the danger as well as the advantage 
of being a pretty girl was closely connected (and 
this was natural) with the idea of an " engage 
ment " : this idea was in a manner complete in 
itself her imagination failed in the oddest way 
to carry it into the next stage. She wanted 
her sister to be engaged but she wanted her not 
at all to be married, and she had not clearly 
made up her mind as to how Francie was to 
enjoy both the promotion and the arrest. It was 
a secret source of humiliation to her that there 
had as yet to her knowledge been no one with 
whom her sister had exchanged vows : if her con 
viction on this subject could have expressed itself 
intelligibly it would have given you a glimpse 
of a droll state of mind a dim theory that a 
bright girl ought to be able to try successive 
aspirants. Delia s conception of what such a trial 
might consist of was strangely innocent : it 
was made up of calls and walks and buggy-drives 
and above all of being spoken of as engaged ; 
and it never occurred to her that a repetition of 
lovers rubs off a young lady s delicacy. She felt 
herself a born old maid and never dreamed of a 
lover of her own he would have been dreadfully 



in her way ; but she dreamed of love as something 
in its nature very delicate. All the same she dis 
criminated ; it did lead to something after all, and 
she desired that for Francie it should not lead to 
a union with Mr. Flack. She looked at such a 
union in the light of that other view which she 
kept as yet to herself but which she was ready 
to produce so soon as the right occasion should 
come up ; and she told her sister that she would 
never speak to her again if she should let 

this young man suppose And here she 

always paused, plunging again into impressive 
reticence. 

" Suppose what ? " Francie asked, as if she were 
totally unacquainted (which indeed she really was) 
with the suppositions of young men. 

" "Well, you 'll see, when he begins to say things 
you won 't like." This sounded ominous on Delia s 
part, but she had in reality very little apprehen
