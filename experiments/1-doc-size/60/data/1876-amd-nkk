a subtle understanding between, something that would 
have been quite indescribable on Daisy's part, had she 
wanted to confess it ; and no pure, sweet soul like hers 
could have talked over a suspected love. It had not come 
near enough to isolate her, not even to set her thinking 
what this friendly tenderness on Mr. Dudley's part meant. 





September came in brilliantly, with magnificent sun 
sets that made the sea a glow of fire. Dr. Kinnard was 
to come for a week, and then the household would break 
np ; Mrs. Glyndon going on a westward tour with her 
husband. Nelly counted the daj's from no spirit of 
ungraciousness, but a positive longing for relief from the 
strain upon her. A thrilling fear had taken possession 
of her. Save Daisy she must, if she exerted herself to 
the utmost ; and never had Van Alstyne made himself 
more dangerous. She had the strong safeguard of a 
husband's love., and her own honor; but how was Daisy, 
to know the shoals and quicksands of this desperate 
tide! 

This was what Van Alstyne liked. He could not 
understand her noble impulse ; but he saw she was re 
solved to keep him away from her sister, even if she 
made the utmost exertion. It brought out the latent 
forces of her nature, many charming little ways that a 
society-belle might have envied for their dainty piquancy. 

"I shall have one more entertainment," said Mrs. 
Gbyndon. ' ' I want to ask the Daventrj-s and the Max 
wells ; but I am a little puzzled ; ' ' and there she 
paused. 

"About what?" asked Daisy, looking up from her 
game of chess with Van Alstyne, who was playing shame 
fully into her hands. 

"I want it to be real charming, of course. If the 
Howe party were here, we would make it music and con 
versation ; but the Daventry girls are extravagantby fond 
of dancing. Dr. Kinnard and Mr. Dudley will be here, 
and how to suit the different tastes " 

" "Why, have everything," said Van Alstyne, looking 
up with a glow of interest, talking for the sedate, music 
for the sentimental, and dancing for such commonplace 
people as Miss Endicott and I. There ! why do you not 
say ' check ? ' You may never have so good a chance 
again." 





" You have not been tiying in real earnest."
