about getting some shoes to make. 

" Lord ! he'd never finish a set, if he got 'em," parenthetically, 
"but it does him good to try to do suthin', 
once in a while ; makes him feel like other folks." 

Oswald accepted the offer of the boat ; but the next 
morning found him also on his way to Stowe, in the 
only wagon belonging to the Sea View. 

His mood had changed ; and, no longer caring for 
sea-dreams or fowl, he was on his way to Boston by 
the early train. 



CHAPTER V. 

most apparent effect of Philip's day with Os- 
wald was a bad cold ; a less visible result, a pleas- 
ant excitement in remembering that he had gained a 
fragment of real information about the theater. This 
was the first person he had ever met who bore the air 
of having an intimate knowledge of the life of which the 
boy dreamed. The last few years had been filled with 
dreams, assuming the more gigantic proportions as 
they depended so entirely on imagination for their 
growth. At first he had brought them within the 
scope of known facts ; dramatic life existed and men 
had written plays, but as a younger child he went no 
further than imagining himself listening to Shakespeare 
(which he knew better than any school-book), on a real 
stage. But once give the rein to imagination, especial- 
ly if the mind has been starved of experience of life, 
and where will one stop ? Philip had, at least, that 
tiny germ of genius which will grow fit to cope with 
deeds if circumstances favor it a passionate desire to 
create. The capacity for work might not be there, 
nor the power of mastering technicalities, but the 
longing was strong. 

He had been hemmed in from all intercourse with life 
outside Stratford by circumstances which he was too 
young, if not too irresolute, to overcome. There were 



 

few books at home, and all but his dear Shakespeare 
were calculated to fit a religious bent of mind What 
could have been expected ? Healthy mental growth 
was impossible for want of good food ; was it any won- 
der that the rootlets of fancy should suck the juices 
the unknown and find their way luxuriantly into 
untrodden soil ? Since he must color his thought in- 
ependently of outward suggestions, there was every 
eason that his intense nature should make the hues as 
rich and varied as possible.
