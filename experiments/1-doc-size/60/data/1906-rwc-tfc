" Didn't I ? " repeated Mortimer peevishly, begin- 
ning to lose countenance. 

" I don't understand you," said Plank, " and I don't 
think I want to understand you." 

" What do you mean .'' " demanded Mortimer thickly ; 
" don't you want to marry that girl ! " but he shrank 
dismayed under the slow blaze that lighted Plank's blue 
eyes. 

" All right," he stammered, struggHng to his fat 
legs and instinctively backing away ; " I thought you 
meant business. I â€” what the devil do I care who you 
marry ! It's the last time I try to do anything for 
you, or for anybody else ! Mark that, my friend. I've 
plenty to worry over; I've a lot to keep me busy with- 
out lying awake to figure out how to do kindnesses to 
old friends. Damn this ingratitude, anyway ! " 

Plank gazed at him for a moment; the anger in 
his face had died out. 

" I am not ungrateful," he said. " You may say 
almost anything except that, Leroy. I am not dis- 
loyal, no matter wliat else I may be. But you liave 
made a bad mistake. You made it that day at Black 
Fells when you offered to interfere. I supposed you 
understood then that I could never tolerate from any- 
body anything of such a nature. It appears that you 
didn't. However, you understand it now. So let us 
forget the matter." 

But Mortimer, keenly appreciative of the pleasures 
of being misunderstood, squeezed some moisture out of 
his distended eyes, and sat down, a martyr to his emo- 





 



tions. " To think," he gulped, " that you, of all men, 
should turn on me like this ! '' 

" I didn't mean to. Can't you understand, Leroy, 
that you hurt me? " 

" Hurt hell ! " retorted Mortimer vindictively. 
" You've had sensation battered out of you by this 
time. I guess society has landed you a few while I was 
boosting you over the outworks. Don't play that old 
con game on me! You tried to get her and you 
couldn't. Now I come along and offer to put you 
next and you yell about your hurt feelings ! Oh, 
splash! There's another lady, that's all."
