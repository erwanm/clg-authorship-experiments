" You haven't, Stephen ? " 

What did this girl know? Why, she was worse 
than the twelve jurymen. 

" I shouldn't like to be held to a strict account for any 
chance word. There's been a good deal of hard talk, 
first and last ; though I should come to a pretty tight 
pass in my life before I'd stain it with such a black deed. 
Old Mr. Ellicott's been taken with paralysis." 

" It's dreadful ; " and Joe shivered. " Mrs. Vennard's 
going on like a crazy woman. No one seems to care 
about the child ; but I suppose she doesn't half under- 
stand it." 

"No," said Stephen, briefly, going in to his father. 

The weak, wandering eyes gave a faint sign of rec- 
ognition. What had been passing over yonder he 
neither knew, nor cared to know. Stephen felt the 
pulse a faint thread. For days he had taken only 
the slightest nourishment. At this rate the weak frame 
would soon be worn out. It was best so. And if he 
could never come to a sense of the awful deed he had 
committed How far did God's mercy extend ? 

He took up the tattered fan, and commenced brush- 
ing away the flies. Joe, just outside the door, had been 
having a good cry ; why she hardly knew. Now that 
she felt better, she came in, and, stirring among the 
ashes, began "to kindle the fire. Eating was a stern 
demand of nature. But Joe's heart was going through 
a fierce struggle for Stephen. How much we suffer for 
one another ! 



 

Stephen fell into deep thought. After it was all 
over his duty here he meant to try the world ; to 
dare a hard battle, and win something. This secret 
buried in the grave, there would be no phantom to 
haunt him, to dog his steps with that uneasy sense of 
danger. He would board Joe in some pleasant family, 
and feel free to use his time and his energy for himself. 
He was young and strong, used to work, willing to 
wait. In ten years he would still be a young man ; 
but at thirty-three he meant to stand on some higher 
plane than this. 

Joe, little dreaming how she had been discarded from 
the fortune Stephen was to carve out for himself, 
yearned over him in her passionate tenderness, and 
whispered to herself between her sighs, "It's all the 
same to me. If the whole world believed it against 
you, 'twouldn't alter my love."
