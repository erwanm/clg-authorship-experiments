fail to do so, and the thought did not fail to restore 
him to her tenderness again. 

I do not know how it is that clergymen and phy 
sicians keep from telling their wives the secrets 
confided to them ; perhaps they can trust their 
wives to find them out for themselves whenever 
they wish. Sewell had laid before his wife the 
case of the Laphams after they came to consult 
with him about Corey's proposal to Penelope, for 
he wished to be confirmed in his belief that he had 
advised them soundly ; but he had not given her 
their names, and he had not known Corey's him 
self. Now he had no compunctions in talking the 
affair over with her without the veil of ignorance 
which she had hitherto assumed, for she declared 
that as soon as she heard of Corey's engagement 
to Penelope, the whole thing had flashed upon her. 
"And that night at dinner I could have told the 
child that he was in love with her sister by the way 
he talked about her ; I heard him ; and if she had 
not been so blindly in love with him herself, she 
would have known it too. I must say, I can't help 
feeling a sort of contempt for her sister." 

"Oh, but you must not !" cried SewelL "That 



 

is wrong, cruelly wrong. I 'm sure that s out of 
your novel-reading, my dear, and not out of your 
heart. Come ! It grieves me to hear you say such 
a thing as that." 

" Oh, I dare say this pretty thing has got over it 
how much character she has got ! and I suppose 
she'll see somebody else." 

Sewell had to content himself with this partial 
concession. As a matter of fact, unless it was the 
young West Virginian who had come on to arrange 
the purchase of the Works, Irene had not yet seen 
any one, and whether there was ever anything be 
tween them is a fact that would need a separate in 
quiry. It is certain that at the end of five years 
after the disappointment which she met so bravely, 
she was still unmarried. But she was even then 
still very young, and her life at Lapham had been 
varied by visits to the West. It had also been 
varied by an invitation, made with the politest re 
solution by Mrs. Corey, to visit in Boston, which the 
girl was equal to refusing in the same spirit. 

Sewell was intensely interested in the moral spec 
tacle which Lapham presented under his changed 
conditions. The Colonel, who was more the Colonel 
in those hills than he could ever have been on the 
Back Bay, kept him and Mrs. Sewell over night at
