in with your father." 

" Yes, those are all good points, mother," said the 
girl ; " and if you keep saying them over, and count 
a hundred every time before you speak, I guess 
you 'll worry through." 

Mrs. Lapharn had been fussing distractedly with 
her hair and ribbons, in preparation for her encoun 
ter with Mrs. Corey. She now drew in a long 
quivering breath, stared at her daughter without 
seeing her, and hurried downstairs. It was true 
that when she met Mrs. Corey before she had not 
been awed by her ; but since then she had learned 
at least her own ignorance of the world, and she 
had talked over the things she had misconceived 
and the things she had shrewdly guessed so much 
that she could not meet her on the former footing 
of equality. In spite of as brave a spirit and as 
good a conscience as woman need have, Mrs. Lap-

" I don't know just when she 'll be in. She went to 
get a book." And here she turned red again, know 
ing that Irene had gone to get the book because it 
was one that Corey had spoken of. 

" Oh ! I 'm sorry," said Mrs. Corey. " I had 
hoped to see her. And your other daughter, whom 
I never met ? " 

" Penelope ? " asked Mrs. Lapham, eased a little. 
" She is at home. I will go and call her." The 
Laphams had not yet thought of spending their 
superfluity on servants who could be rung for ; they 
kept two girls and a man to look after the furnace, 
as they had for the last ten years. If Mrs. Lapham 
had rung in the parlour, her second girl would have 
gone to the street door to see who was there. She 
went upstairs for Penelope herself, and the girl,
