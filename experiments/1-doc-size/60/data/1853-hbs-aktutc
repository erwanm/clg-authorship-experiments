states are Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and
Missouri. These are slave-raising states, and the others are
slave-consuming states. We have shown, in the preceding chapters, the

to produce on the minds of our readers something of the impression which
has been produced on our own mind by their multiplicity and abundance,
we shall add a few more here. For the State of VIRGINIA, see all the
following:
