ping into a hole. I killed it, and prepared a delicious 
meal ; then, protected by a large fire, I lay down to rest. 
On the following morning I began my dangerous journey 
through the thicket, and reached in safety the other bank 
of the abyss, which had been the cause of all my suflFering' 
and misfortunes. A few steps further, and there â€” a loud 
shout of joy burst from me, my senses forsook me, and I 
Bank fainting on the ground. 

When I came to myself, and stood up, I found myself 
in a broad frequented path, where I discovered quite 
recent footprints. I followed it as quickly as my fatigue 
would allow me to, and soon" encountered a troop of trav- 
elling natives, who were proceeding slowly with their 
mules. They were not a little terrified to behold in this 
wilderness a man wandering towards them, travel-stained 
and hollow-eyed, but received me most kindly when I had 
told them my story,- strengthened me with a most refresh- 
ing Boup, and brought me safely to the coast in three 



 

days. In a short time I found an opportunity to embark, 
and returned safely to my friends and dear ones, who 
were mourning most bitterly my disappearance and proba- 
ble death, and who regarded me almost like one risen 
firom the dead. 





After a short delay on the eastern coast of Madagascar, 
where we had laid in fresh water and provisions, we 
weighed anchor, and with a favourable wind, steered firf 
Java, the place of our destination. It was a beautiful 
November day. I stood on deck enjoying the prospect of 
the quiet sea, congratulating myself that the most tedious 
as well as the most dangerous part of our voyage from 
Holland was accomplished, for the Cape of Good Hope lay 
far behind us, and counting over the profits that our rich 
cargo must ensure us, when all at once the terrible cry of 
fire ! fire ! was heard. I hastened down into the hold, 
whence the cry proceeded, but saw nothing ; to my inquiry 
as to what was burning, one of the sailors replied, " in 
that cask there." I thrust my hand into it, but as I pe 
ceived no fire, I ascended again to the deck to ascertaia 
the cause of the noise. 

The steward had gone down into the hold in the after- 
noon, as usual, to fill a bucket with the spirits which were 
to be distributed to the crew the following day, when after 
accomplishing his task, he took up the candlestick which 
held the tallow candle, and which he had set down upon a 
cask near that from which he had filled his bucket, a spark 
fell into the open bung-hole and the flames burst forth from 
the cask; immediately the top and bottom fell out, aud
