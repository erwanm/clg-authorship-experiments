the contents. He guessed that the value of the gold must be about a
thousand crowns, as Ortensia had said it was. During this time she
quietly arranged her veil on her head, fastening it with the long silver
pin, and then put on the glove he had restored to her. At last he looked
up and spoke.

'Where one knows everything,' he observed, 'it is impossible not to be
surprised at the lamentable ignorance in which most people live. For
instance, if I had not this demonstration of the fact, which agrees well
with my own knowledge, I should find it hard to believe that you and
your husband could have been foolish enough to make friends with the
very men whom your uncle the Senator Pignaver had sent to murder you.'

'We were deceived, Eminence,' answered Ortensia. 'I need not tell you
how, since everything is known to you. All I ask is my husband's
liberty.'

'Your husband, madam, appears to have broken my nephew's nose,' replied
the Cardinal, with the utmost gravity. 'Moreover, Alberto is not only my
own nephew by blood, but His Holiness's also, both in fact, as the son
of the Pope's niece, Donna Lucia, and also by formal adoption. I doubt
whether His Holiness will easily overlook such an offence. To break the
nose of a Pope's nephew, madam, is a serious matter. I would have you
understand that.'

'Then send me to prison with my husband!' cried Ortensia desperately.

The Cardinal slowly rubbed his pale chin with his amethyst ring, and
looked at her.

'There may be an alternative to that somewhat extreme course,' he
observed. 'Calm yourself, I beg of you, and I will see His Holiness as
soon as possible. In the meantime, it would be well for you to take some
rest.'

'Rest!' Ortensia exclaimed. 'How can I rest while he is in prison,
unless I can be near him?'

'I cannot see the connection of ideas,' the Cardinal answered coldly.

He looked at her with some curiosity, for he had never been in love with
anything but power since he had first gone to school.

He rang a gilt bell that stood beside the gilt inkstand, and a
grey-haired priest, still unshaven and shabbily dressed, came at the
call. His face was as yellow as common beeswax, and his little eyes were
bloodshot. The Cardinal pushed the purse across the polished mahogany.

'Count that money,' he said briefly, and opening the drawer of the table
he took out a sheet of paper and began to write, while the shabby
secretary counted out the gold in the palm of his hand, as if he were
used to doing it.

The letter was not long, and the Cardinal read it over to himself with
evident care before folding it. He even smiled faintly, as he had done
when he had returned Ortensia's things. He turned in the top and bottom
of the sheet so that the edges just met, and after creasing the bends
with his large pale thumb-nail he doubled the folded paper neatly, and
then turned up the ends and slipped one into the other.
