But the shadows from Mrs. Abercrombie's clouded brow fell not alone
upon her household. The spirit that pervades the home-circle is
often carried forth by those who go out into the world. It was so in
this case. Mr. Abercrombie's feelings were overcast with shadows
when he entered the store. There was a pressure, in consequence,
upon his bosom, and a state of irritability which he essayed, though
feebly and ineffectually, to overcome.

"Where is Edward?" he inquired, soon after his arrival.

Edward was a lad, the son of a poor widow, who had recently been
employed in Mr. Abercrombie's store.

"He hasn't come yet," was answered.

"Not come yet?" said Mr. Abercrombie, in a fretful tone.

"No, sir."

"This is the third time he has been late within the past week, is it
not?"

"Yes, sir."

"Very well: it shall be the last time."

At this moment the boy came in. Mr. Abercrombie looked at him
sternly for a moment, and then said--

can go home."

The poor lad's face crimsoned instantly, and he tried to say
something about his mother's being sick, but Mr. Abercrombie waved
his hand impatiently, and told him that he didn't wish to hear any
excuse.

Scarcely had the boy left the presence of Mr. Abercrombie, ere this
hasty action was repented of. But the merchant's pride of

His word had passed, and could not be recalled. Deeper were the
shadows that now fell upon his heart--more fretted the state of mind
that supervened.

Ah! the shadows would have been deeper still, could he have seen
that unhappy boy a little while afterward, as, with his face buried
in the pillow that supported the head of his sick mother, he sobbed
until his whole frame quivered. Had Mr. Abercrombie only asked the
reason why his appearance at the store was so late on this morning,
he would have learned that the delay had been solely occasioned by
needful attendance on his sick and almost helpless mother; and on a
little further inquiry, humanity would have dictated approval rather
than censure and punishment. But, touching all this painful consequence
of his ill-nature, the merchant knew nothing. How rarely do we
become cognizant of the evil wrought upon others by our hasty and
ill-judged actions!

The shadow was still on Mr. Abercrombie's feelings, when, half an
hour afterward, a man came to him and said--
