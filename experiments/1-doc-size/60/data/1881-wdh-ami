argand burner, " I hain 't seen anything yet that suits 
me much better than this." 

" It isn 't bad," said Bartley. He had got up a 
plate of crackers and two bottles of tivoli, and was 



 

opening the first. He offered the beaded goblet to 
Kinney. 

" Thank you," said Kinney. " Not any. I never 
do." 

Bartley quaffed half of it in tolerant content. " I 
always do. Find it takes my nerves down at the end
