CHAPTER XH. 

" There is no after-victory so sweet as the first. There 
is no money like that from one's earliest effort. Miss 
Marshall, accept my congratulations. Your picture is 
sold. There is the cheque. ! " 

Paul Thierry laid it down on the table before her. Mrs. 
Marshall came and glanced at it with motherly pride. 
Celia uttered a cry of joy, but Mrs. Marshall's face was a 
vivid scarlet. 

"Then you, too, know him — Mr. Howarth?" # She 
struggled to regain her composure, but her voice was 
unsteady. 

" I have been most happy to number Leonard Howarth 
among my friends for the last seven years. His is a 
strong, pure, manly soul. The picture is to be a gift to 
his wife, who is hardly less lovely than Mrs. Van Cleve. 
Celia, you have fallen into good hands." 

She felt the manner was to cover her agitation. What 
did he think of it ? A pang of pure anguish pierced her 
soul. She could not afford to have any man mistake her. 

"But the kindliness, the real generosity, was yours. 
What could I have achieved without your patient train- 
ing— 

"But if there had been nothing to train?" and he 
laughed. " And back of it all we must thank Stephen 
Archer for first discerning what manner of soul you pos- 
sessed." 

" But you are quite sure that — that I am not overpaid ? 
I told you I did not want benevolence." 

 





" My dear girl, rest your anxious little soul. I asked 
seventy-five ; I could have had one hundred for it after 
he saw it. And now — not another word upon art until 
you are through with this bothersome graduating ; and 
then I want you to begin in grand earnest. Ah, you will 
learn then what hard work really means." 

She glanced up with eloquent, tearful eyes. 

As he was nio?ing through the store, Mrs. Marshall 
uttered his name in a low tone, and he turned. 

" I want to make a brief explanation, " she began hur- 
riedly. " Did you know when you took Celia's picture 
to Mr. Howarth — " and she colored again, drawing a 
fluttering breath.
