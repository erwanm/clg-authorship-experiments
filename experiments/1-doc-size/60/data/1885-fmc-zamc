" You must have seen Zoroaster very often before 
he left Shushan," she said. "You know him so 
well." 

" Yes — every one knew him. He was the favourite 
of the court, with his beauty and his courage and his 
strange affection for that old — for the old Hebrew 
prophet. That is why Cambyses sent them both 
away," added she with a light laugh. " They were 
far too good, both of them, to be endured among the 
doings of those times." 

Atossa spoke readily enough of Cambyses. Nehushta wondered whether she could be induced to 
speak of Smerdis. Her supposed ignorance of the 
true nature of what had occurred in the last few 
months would permit her to speak of the dead usurper 
with impunity. 

" I suppose there have been great changes lately 
in the manners of the court — during this last year," 
suggested Nehushta carelessly. She pulled a raisin 
from the dry stem, and tried to peel it with her deli- 
cate fingers. 

" Indeed there have been changes," answered Atossa, 



 

calmly. " A great many things that used to be 
tolerated will never be heard of now. On the whole,

a most appropriate choice of his tutelary goddess. 
Smerdis " — continued the queen in measured tones 
and with the utmost calmness of manner — " Smerdis

the earth by the grace of Auramazda. I, for my 
part, have always inclined to the Hebrew conception 
of one God — perhaps that is much the same as 
Auramazda, the All- Wise. What do you think ? " 

Nehushta smiled at the deft way in which the 
queen avoided speaking of Smerdis by turning the 
conversation again to religious topics. But fearing 
another lecture on the comparative merits of idolatry, 
human sacrifice, and monotheism, she manifested very 
little interest in the subject. 

" I daresay it is the same. Zoroaster always says 
so, and that was the one point that Daniel could never 
forgive him. The sun is coming through those plants 
upon your head — shall we not have our cushions 
moved into the shade at the other end ? " She clapped
