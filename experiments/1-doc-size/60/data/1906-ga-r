volcano across the sound — who sends up a column of light once in a way to dazzle her shrouded 
eyes, and failing that batters her with rock and 
stone like any lover of the slums. One day he 
spat forth a rock like a small hill, and big enough 
to dominate the strip of lowland at least, standing 
out on the edge of the island like a guard at the 
gates, and never a part of the alien surface. Between this lofty rock and the forest was the walled 
settlement of New Archangel, that Baranhov, the 
dauntless, had wrested from the bloodthirsty 
Kolosh but a short time since and purposed to 
hold in the interest of the Russian- American Company. His log hut, painted like the other buildings 
with a yellow ochre found in the soil, stood on the 
rock, and his glass swept the forest as often as 
the sea. 

As Rezanov, on the second of July, thirty-one 
days after leaving San Francisco, sailed into the 
harbor with its hundred bits of volcanic woodland 
weeping as ever, he gave a whimsical sigh in 
tribute to the gay and ever-changing beauties of 
the southern land, but was in no mood for sentimental reminiscence. Natives, paddling eagerly 
out to sea in their bidarkas to be the first to bring 
in good news or bad, had given him a report covering the period of his absence that filled him with 
dismay. There had been deaths from scurvy ; one 
of the largest ships belonging to the Company 
had been wrecked and the entire cargo lost; of a 
hunting party of three hundred Aleuts in one hundred and forty bidarka«, which had gone from 
Sitka to Kadiak in November of the preceding 
year, not one had arrived at its destination, and 
there was reason to believe that all had been 
drowned or massacred; and the Eussians and 
Aleuts at Behring's Bay settlement had been exterminated by one of the native tribes. 

But the Juno was received with salvos of artillery from the fort, and cheered by the entire population of the settlement, crowded on the beach. 
Baranhov, looking like a monkey with a mummy's 
head in which only a pair of incomparably shrewd 
eyes still lived, his black wig fastened on his bald 
red-fringed pate with a silk handkerchief tied 
under his chin, «tood, hands on hips, shaking with 
excitement and delight. The bearded long-haired 
priests, in full canonicals of black and gold, were 
beside the Chief-Manager, ready to escort the 
Chamberlain to the chapel at the head of the 
solitary street, where the bells were pealing and a 
mass of thanksgiving was to be said for his safe 
return. 



But it was some time before Eezanov could 
reach the chapel or even exchange salutations with 
Baranhov. As he stepped on shore he was surrounded, almost hustled by the shouting crowd of 
Russians — many of them convicts — Aleuts and 
Sitkans, who knelt at his feet, endeavored to kiss 
his hand, his garments, in their hysterical gratitude for the food he had brought them. For the 
first time he felt reconciled to his departure from
