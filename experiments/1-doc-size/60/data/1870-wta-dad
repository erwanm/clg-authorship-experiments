I observed the movements of the two persons on board of the Florina for
some time. One of them jumped into the tender, at last, and shoved off.

"He's coming this way," said Marian.

"I see he is; it don't look like Mr. Whippleton," I replied, closely
scrutinizing the person in the small boat. "I think you had better stay
in the cabin, Marian."

"Why?"

"If it should be Mr. Whippleton, there may be some trouble."

"What trouble?"

"The moment he sees me he will understand my business with him; and to
be entirely candid with you, I am afraid I shall have a worse battle
with him than I had with Mr. Waterford."

"Why, you will not fight!"

"I must have your father's money, and the property he stole from me."

"I hope you won't quarrel," she added, anxiously.

"Not if I can help it. Mr. Whippleton is a fugitive from justice, and I
don't mean to let him escape me."

"I am afraid of him. If he gets rid of you, he will go back and find
Mr. Waterford."

"Well, don't worry any more yet. That is not Mr. Whippleton in the
boat. I am sorry it is not he," I continued, satisfied, as the boat
approached, that it was not the fugitive.

"Why are you sorry?"

"Because, if this other person, whoever he is, come on board, and find
that Mr. Waterford is not here, and that I am here, he will try to
escape."

"Of course he knows that you are here."

"I am afraid he does; but I hope not. He had passed the point at the
mouth of the creek when the battle was finished on the other side of
the lake. I can't tell whether he saw the result or not."

"That's a black man in the boat," said Marian.

"Then he has engaged a cook."

I knew that Mr. Whippleton sometimes employed a colored man, who had
been a sailor and a cook on the lake, to help him work the yacht when I
could not go with him; but I had never seen him, and did not think it
probable that he knew me. I went into the cabin, and brought out one of
Mr. Waterford's rifles; but as I did not intend to kill anybody, I did
not take the precaution to load it.

"What are you going to do with that, Philip?" asked Marian, as I
returned to the standing-room, with the rifle in my hand.
