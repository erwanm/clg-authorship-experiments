"I wonder," Rowland observed presently, "if you 
really know what a charming girl she is. She 's an 
awfully charming girl." 

" Evidently or I should not have cared for her !" 

" don 't you care for her now, then ?" 

" Oh, don 't force a fellow to say rude things !" 

"Well, I can only say that you don 't know what you

death ? I shouldn 't be long in letting her know it, and 
then, pray, where would she be?" Roderick asked, im 
patiently. 

Rowland walked the length of the room a couple of 
times and then stopped suddenly. " Go your way, then !
