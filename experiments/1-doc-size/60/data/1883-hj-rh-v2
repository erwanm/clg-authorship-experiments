"That 's a pity. It was described to me as a charm 
ing piece of quaintness ; a little demure, thin-lipped old 
lady, with her head on one side and the prettiest wrinkles 
in the world a sort of fairy godmother. " 

" Go and see it, and judge for yourself," said Rowland. 

"No, I see I shall be disappointed. It 's quite the 
other thing, the sort of thing they put into the campo- 
santos. I wish that crazy boy would listen to me for 
ten minutes !" 

But a day or two later Rowland met him again in the 
street, and, as they were near, proposed they should 
adjourn to Roderick 's studio. He consented, and on 
entering they found the young master. Roderick 's 
demeanour to Gloriani was never conciliatory, and on 
this occasion blank indifference was apparently all he had 
to offer. But Gloriani, like a genuine connoisseur, cared 
nothing for his manners ; he cared only for his skill. In 
the bust of Mrs. Hudson there was something almost 
touching ; it was an exquisite example of a ruling sense 
of beauty. The poor lady 's small, neat, timorous face 
had certainly no great character, but Roderick had pro 
duced its sweetness, its mildness, its minuteness, its still 
maternal passion, with the most unerring art. The thing 
was perfectly unflattered, and yet admirably tender ; it 
was the poetry of fidelity. Gloriani stood looking at it 
a long time intently. Roderick wandered away into the 
neighbouring room. 

" I give it up !" said the sculptor at last. "I don 't 
understand it." 

" But you like it ?" said Rowland. 

"Like it? It 's a pearl of pearls. Tell me this," 
he added; "is he very fond of his mother is he a 



 

very good son?" And he gave Rowland a sharp 
look. 

"Why, she adores him," said Rowland, smiling. 

" That 's not an answer ! But it 's none of my business. 
Only if I, in his place, being suspected of having what 
shall I call it ? a cold heart, managed to do that piece 
of work, oh, oh ! I should be called a pretty lot of 
names. Charlatan, posetir, arrangeur I But he can do 
as he chooses ! My dear young man, I know you don 't 
like me," he went on as Roderick came back. "It 's a 
pity ; you are strong enough not to care about me at all. 
You are very strong." 

"Not at all," said Roderick, curtly. " I am very 
weak !"
