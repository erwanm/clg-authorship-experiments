the boys had a good start, and plunged 
into narrow ways where horses could not 
follow; and doubling, twisting, following 
paths but recently beaten by Anastacio in 
pursuit of deer, Roldan and Adan were 
soon far beyond the reach or ken of the 
men of war. It was an hour, however, be 
fore they thought it wise to arrest their 
flight and pause to recuperate in a red 
wood tree hollowed by fire. Two weeks 
of exposure and unwonted exertions had 
hardened Adan's superfluous flesh, and he 
was scarcely more spent than his clean 
limbed friend, although every step had 
been taken with protest. 

" Caramba ! " he said, in a hoarse 
whisper at length. " When I am back on the 
rancho I won't walk for a year." 

"You will have the habit by that time,

and we can. When we get back to the 
pueblo, even if we cannot reach the larder, 
we can find the corral without being seen. 
I don't believe that the soldiers have found 
it, and the Indians in charge of the 
mustangs will let us have two when they know 


what has happened. Now, do not let us 
talk. It will make us more hungry." 

Adan groaned, but accepted the decree 
of silence. The day wore on to noon, and 
in the unbroken stillness the boys ventured
