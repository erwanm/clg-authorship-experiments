Yes, — I shall rise upon wings of a sapphire 
sheen, and toss myself up in the wind and shake 
down showers of golden light into thy wonder- 
ing eyes, oh bald-headed, grim-visaged senior- 
partner! 

— It is my business to show samples of paper. 
I shall learn all about them in a few days, and 
then I shall go at the Greek. 

July 28th. 

Whenever I feel weary I run ofif into a corner 
and whisper into my ear, " It is done! Be not 
afraid!" Instantly my heart goes up like swift 
music. 

July 31st. 

Twelve days since I left The Captive; they 
said it would take three weeks. 

Something strange flashed over me to-day, 
something that sent a shudder through me; I 






have done a strange thing to myself this summer, 
not in metaphor, but in fact. I have seen a ghost; 
I have drunk a potion; I have gazed upon a 
nymph; I have made myself mad! 

I am no longer a man among men — I am 
" the reed that grows never more again " ! 

— I try to lose myself in a book, but the book 
does not hold me. Nothing satisfies me as it 
used to, — I am restless, hungry, ill at ease. Why 
should I read this man's weak efiforts — what 
profits me that man's half-truths? 

— And all the time I know too well what I 
want — I want to fight! 

I want to get back into the woods again! I 
want that vision again! That work again! I 
want myself! 

— And here I am, a bird in a cage, beating the 
bars. What folly to say that I can be strong and 
endure this thing! That I can endure anything, 
dare anything. Yes, so I can — if I can strive! 
Put me out there alone, and set me a task, and 
I will do it though it kill me. But how can I 
conquer when I can not strive?
