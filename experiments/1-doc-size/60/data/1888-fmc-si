that. If you were, Giovanni would not have had you for a 
wife nor I for a daughter.' 

' I think it is my fault. I would do anything in the 
world to make it otherwise.' 

' You admit the fact then ? Of course. It is a misfor 
tune, and not your fault. It is one more misfortune among 
so many. You may forgive him, if you please. I will not. 
By the bye, I wonder why he does not come back. I would 
like to hear the news.' 

' The cardinal may have kept him to breakfast.'

' Ay, what does it matter, provided we have peace ? What 
does anything matter in this unutterably ridiculous world 
except your happiness, poor child ! Yes. Everything must
