She is very ill again. Once Dr. Sheldon watches all 
night. How good and kind he is ! 

School begins. It seems as if all the years to come 
were to be divided by these two periods, — “school 
begins,” and “it is vacation.” I am losing the bright, 
happy interest I had at first. 

The confinement is telling on father. He has a little 
fever, and no appetite. He must break out, and spend two 
weeks in the country. His eyes trouble him very much 
too : so he gives up the situation. We have my eight 
dollars a week, and Dell’s four. I must take Dell’s 
money out of the bank to pay the half-yearly interest. 
What of my old dresses are serviceable ? How can I trim 
and furbish and alter? Ah, what should I do without 
Theo ? 

The month passes, and the letter comes. It is curious, 
to say the least; a very guarded, non-committal missive, 
exhorting Theo to love and trust her husband, as to give 
him up would no doubt ruin his life, he loves her so. It 
does not say boldly and clearly that he never has been 
married, but that she need not fear being troubled. The 
sentence is suspicious. 

What can we do next? 

Dr. Sheldon learns that we can send by an agent ; or a 
lawyer here can communicate with a lawyer at Manchester, 
or, better still, at Edinburgh, where Mr. Ross spent those 
}Tars of his young hfe. Search can be made. 


 


It is ridiculous that a little money should stand between 
us and this necessary knowledge. But the unvarnished 
truth is, that there is not even enough to bury Theo if 
she should die. One comes to laugh drearily at misery 
even. 

“ I warn you all fairly,” I say with an imposing wave 
of my hand, “ that I never shall forgive any one who dies 
before we have at least one hundred dollars in the bank.” 

Theo improves a little. What shall she do? Mr. Ross 
protests that the idea of a previous marriage is false, and 
an insult to him. Cannot Theo believe his brothers? 
Then he grows exigeant. She is his wife. He is willing 
to take her, and pro\ide a home for her, — the best within 
his means ; or, if she prefers, he will come back here. 

That cannot be, we all admit. 

“ Perhaps I had better go,” she remarks with a dreary 
hopelessness in her voice. “ I am making you so much 
trouble. And — I do not believe I shall live very long 
anywhere. What does it matter? ”
