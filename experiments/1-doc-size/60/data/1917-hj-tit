who began to suggest a shyness, momentary, 
without doubt, and determined by the very 
plenitude of his friend's welcome, yet so far in- 
congruous as that it was not his adoption of a 
manner and betrayal of a cheer that ran the risk 
of seeming a trifle gross, but quite these indica- 
tions on the part of the fortunate heir of the old 
person awaiting interment somewhere above. 
He could only have seen with the lapse of the 
moments that Gray was going to be simple â€” ad- 
mirably, splendidly simple, one would probably 
have pronounced it, in estimating and comparing 
the various possible dangers; but the simplicity 
of subjects tremendously educated, tremendously 
"cultivated" and cosmopolitised, as Horton would 
have called it, especially when such persons were 
naturally rather extra-refined and ultra-percep- 
tive, was a different affair from the crude can- 
dour of the common sort; the consequence of 
which apprehensions and reflections must have 
been, in fine, that he presently recognised in the 
product of "exceptional advantages" now already 
more and more revealed to him such a pliability 
of accent as would easily keep judgment, or at 
least observation, suspended. Gray wasn't going 
to be at a loss for any shade of decency that didn't 
depend, to its inconvenience, on some uncertainty 
about a guest's prejudice; so that once the air 
was cleared of awkwardness by that perception, 





 

exactly, in Horton's ready mind that he and his 
traditions, his susceptibilities, in fact (of all the 
queer things!) his own very simplicities and, 
practically, stupidities were being superfluously 
allowed for and deferred to, and that this, only 
this, was the matter, he should have been able to 
surrender without a reserve to the proposed 
measure of their common rejoicing. Beautiful 
might it have been to him to find his friend so 
considerately glad of him that the spirit of it 
could consort to the last point with any, with 
every, other felt weight in the consciousness so 
attested; in accordance with which we may re- 
mark that continued embarrassment for our 
gallant caller would have implied on his own side, 
or in other words deep within his own spirit, 
some obscure source of confusion. 

What distinguishably happened was thus that 
he first took Graham for exuberant and then for
