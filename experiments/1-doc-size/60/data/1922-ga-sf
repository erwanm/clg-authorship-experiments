you like this. Where — where have you taken 
your meals ? "

She invited him eagerly to enter when he

" Give me some more cognac — anything." 

" You'll have nothing more tonight. I shall 
give you a dose of valerian." 

She swallowed the noxious mixture with a 
grimace and was asleep in a few moments.

doors or to wear anything but a dressing gown
she took her slender meals in her room.
