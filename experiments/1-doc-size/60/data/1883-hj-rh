knows. I suspect that practically she does not commit 
herself. She is excessively proud, and thinks herself 



 

good enough to occupy the highest station in the world ; 
but she knows that her mother talks nonsense, and that 
even a beautiful girl may look awkward in making un 
successful advances. So she remains superbly indifferent, 
and lets her mother take the risks. If the Prince is 
secured, so much the better ; if he is not, she need never 
confess to herself that even a prince has slighted her." 

"Your report is as solid," Rowland said to Madame 
Grandoni, thanking her, "as if it had been drawn up 
for the Academy of Sciences;" and he congratulated 
himself on having listened to it when a couple of days 
later Mrs. Light and her daughter, attended by the 
Cavaliere and the poodle, came to his rooms to look at 
Roderick 's statues. It was more comfortable to know 
just with whom he was dealing. 

Mrs. Light was prodigiously gracious, and showered 
down compliments not only on the statues but on all his 
possessions. "Upon my word," she said, "you rich

fortune to fill them with pictures and statues ? Christina, 
love, look at that mosaic table. Mr. Mallet, I could 
almost beg it from you ! Yes, that Eve is certainly very 
fine. We needn't be ashamed of such a great-grand 
mother as that. If she was really such a beautiful 
woman, it accounts for the good looks of some of us. 
Where is Mr. What s-his-name, the young sculptor ? 
Why isn't he here to be complimented ?" 

Christina had remained but for a moment in the chair 
which Rowland placed for her, had given but a cursory 
glance at the statues, and then, leaving her seat, had 
begun to wander round the room looking at herself in 
the mirror, touching the ornaments and curiosities, 
glancing at the books and prints. Rowland 's sitting- 



 

room was encumbered with bric-a-brac, and she found 
plenty of occupation. Rowland presently ioined her 
and pointed out some of the objects he most valued. 

"It 's an odd jumble," she said, frankly. "Some 
things are very pretty some are very ugly. But I like 
ugly things when they have a certain look. Prettiness 
is terribly vulgar nowadays, and it is not every one that
