the swaying ladder in front of my hermitage. I opened 
the door, half hoping that the Prince of the Powers 
of the Air had come to pay me a visit, and I resolved 
to entertain him royally. But no mighty, potent spirit 
was on my threshold; only a slim youth, drenched 
and pallid, with large pale eyes and pinched features. 
He said nothing, but gazed at me imploringly, while 
the water dripped from every bony angle. Evidently 
this was no devil of jovial tastes ; he was more like a 
washed-out cherub in the process of awkward growth 
toward full angelhood. 

" ' What do you want ? ' I said. He did not answer, 
and somewhat roughly I drew him in ; I never could 
endure to see anything shiver. Then I closed the door, 
and resumed my warm seat and Sweet-Silence, turning 
my back upon the interloper ; he was welcome to ev- 



 

erything save my own personality, let him warm 
himself and eat or sleep, but me he must not approach. 
But minutes passed; the creature neither moved nor 
spoke, and his very silence was more offensive to me 
than loud-tongued importunity. At length it so 
wrought upon me that, angry with myself for being 
unable to banish his miserable presence from my 
thoughts, I turned sharply around and confronted 
him. He had not moved, standing on the exact spot 
where I had left him, shivering and dumb, with the 
rain dripping in chilly little pools upon the floor. 
There were holes in his wet old boots; I could see 
his blue- white skin gleaming through; he had no 
stockings, and no shirt under his ragged coat, held 
together over his narrow chest with long thin fin- 
gers. 

"'Stop shivering, you horrible image of despair,' I 
called out. 

" ' Please, sir, I can't help it,' he answered, humbly. 
Well, of course I went to work ; I knew I should all 
the time, I always do. I got him into warm dry 
clothes, I fed him, I made him drink spiced wine, I 
gave him my own easy-chair. Then, stretching out 
fleecy stockings and slippers upon the hearth, in the 
plenitude of warmth and comfort, gradually the crea- 
ture unfolded all his lank length, and thawed into 
speech. His name was George Washington Brown, 
his tribe Yankee, his state orphanage, his condition 
 



 

poverty, his trouble a malarial chill and fever, which 
haunted him and devoured what poor strength his
