too well?" said the cavalier, his whole manner changing. "Ah! could I
carry you far away to my home in the mountains, far up in the beautiful
blue mountains, where the air is so clear, and the weary, wrangling
world lies so far below that one forgets it entirely, you should be
my wife, my queen, my empress. You should lead me where you would,
your word should be my law. I will go with you wherever you will,--to
confession, to sacrament, to prayers, never so often; never will I
rebel against your word; if you decree, I will bend my neck to king
or priest; I will reconcile me with anybody or anything only for your
sweet sake; you shall lead me all my life; and when we die, I ask only
that you may lead me to our Mother's throne in heaven, and pray her to
tolerate me for your sake. Come, now, dear, is not even one unworthy
soul worth saving?"
"My Lord, you have taught me how wise my holy father was in forbidding
me to listen to you. He knew better than I how weak was my heart,
and how I might be drawn on from step to step till--My Lord, I must
be no man's wife. I follow the blessed Saint Agnes! May God give me
grace to keep my vows without wavering!--for then I shall gain power
to intercede for you and bring down blessings on your soul. Oh, never,
never speak to me so again, my Lord!--you will make me very, very
unhappy. If there is any truth in your words, my Lord, if you really
love me, you will go, and you will never try to speak to me again."
"Never, Agnes? never? Think what you are saying!"
"Oh, I do think! I know it must be best," said Agnes, much agitated;
"for, if I should see you often and hear your voice, I should lose all
my strength. I could never resist, and I should lose heaven for you and
me too. Leave me, and I will never, never forget to pray for you; and
go quickly too, for it is time for my grandmother to come home, and she
would be so angry,--she would never believe I had not been doing wrong,
and perhaps she would make me marry somebody that I do not wish to. She
has threatened that many times; but I beg her to leave me free to go to
my sweet home in the convent and my dear Mother Theresa."
"They shall never marry you against your will, little Agnes, I pledge
you my knightly word. I will protect you from that. Promise me, dear,
that, if ever you be man's wife, you will be mine. Only promise me
that, and I will go."
"Will you?" said Agnes, in an ecstasy of fear and apprehension, in
which there mingled some strange troubled gleams of happiness. "Well,
then, I will. Ah! I hope it is no sin!"
"Believe me, dearest, it is not," said the knight. "Say it again,--say,
that I may hear it,--say, 'If ever I am man's wife, I will be
thine,'--say it, and I will go."
"Well, then, my Lord, if ever I am man's wife, I will be thine," said
Agnes. "But I will be no man's wife. My heart and hand are promised
elsewhere. Come, now, my Lord, your word must be kept."
"Let me put this ring on your finger, lest you forget," said the
cavalier. "It was my mother's ring, and never during her lifetime heard
anything but prayers and hymns. It is saintly, and worthy of thee."
"No, my Lord, I may not. Grandmother would inquire about it. I cannot
keep it; but fear not my forgetting; I shall never forget you."
"Will you ever want to see me, Agnes?"
"I hope not, since it is not best. But you do not go."
"Well, then, farewell, my little wife! farewell, till I claim thee!"
said the cavalier, as he kissed her hand, and vaulted over the wall.
"How strange that I cannot make him understand!" said Agnes, when he
was gone. "I must have sinned, I must have done wrong; but I have been
trying all the while to do right. Why would he stay so, and look at me
so with those deep eyes? I was very hard with him,--very! I trembled
for him, I was so severe; and yet it has not discouraged him enough.
How strange that he would call me so, after all, when I explained to
