‘I daresay you are right,’ Maria answered. ‘I never let Leone
be out in the city on foot or in trams after luncheon. Three or
four times a week he rides with Diego in the Campagna, and they
generally go as far as one of the city gates in a cab, but I always
send Diego’s little brougham to fetch them. I’m afraid they may
both catch cold in a cab after riding.’

‘Your husband is very fond of it, is he not?’

‘Yes, and he rides well, and looks well on a horse--particularly on
that lovely little Andalusian mare he brought from Spain.’

‘The one the Duca di Casalmaggiore is so anxious to buy?’ inquired
Giuliana.

‘The Colonel of the Piedmont Lancers?’ Maria wondered whether her
friend was trying to lead the conversation back to Castiglione
again. ‘I did not know he wanted her.’

‘My dear! He thinks of nothing else! He would like to make it an
affair of State. The other day he came to see Sigismondo and talked
about the mare for three-quarters of an hour, trying to induce him
to use his influence with me, to use my influence with you, to
use your influence with your husband, to induce him to sell the
Andalusian for twenty thousand francs! I think he must be quite
mad! It is an enormous price for a saddle-horse, and he has offered
it through half a dozen people. I wonder that Diego should not have
spoken of it to you.’

‘He never tells me anything,’ Maria replied. ‘But I can guess what
he must have answered. He probably said that the Count of Montalto
buys horses but does not sell them!’

Giuliana laughed.

‘I did not know you could be so malicious, Maria! That is precisely
what he did say.’

‘I did not mean to say anything disagreeable, I’m sure,’ returned
Maria. ‘That is Diego’s way; he is old-fashioned. The idea that a
Count of the Holy Roman Empire could possibly sell anything never
occurred to him.’

‘My father is just like him in that,’ observed Giuliana.

‘So was mine! It is the reason why he left me only just enough to
live comfortably, instead of several millions. If I had not been
his only child we should have starved!’

‘We were ten, and nine of us are alive.’ Giuliana laughed. ‘When
my father and mother were sixty--you know they are just the same
age--there were thirty-two at table, between us and our children!’

‘Look at the Saracinesca family,’ said Maria. ‘Old Prince Giovanni
was an only son, I believe, and now they are like the sands by
the sea! As far as numbers go, there is no fear of the old Roman
families dying out!’

‘Your husband was an only son, was he not?’ Giuliana asked.
