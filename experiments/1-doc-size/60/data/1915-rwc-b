An old peasant woman was cooking, while 
a young one washed dishes. 

"Are the American gentlemen still at table, 
Julie?" she inquired. 

"Mademoiselle Maryette, they are devouring everything in the house!" exclaimed old 
Julie, flinging both hands toward heaven. 
"Tenez, mamzelle, I have heard of eating in 
ancient days, I have read of Gargantua, I 
have been told of banquets, of feasting, of 
appetites! But there is one American in 
there! Mamzelle Maryette, if I should swear 
to you that he is on his third chicken and 









that a row of six pint bottles of 93 Mar- 
gaux stand empty on the cloth at his elbow, 
I should do no penance for untruthfulness. 
Tenez, Mamzelle Maryette, regardez un peu 
par I oubliette And old Julie slid open 
the wooden shutter on the crack and Maryette 
bent forward and surveyed the dining room 
outside. 

They were laughing very loud in there, 
these three Americans three powerful, sun- 
scorched young men, very much at their ease 
around the table, draining the red Bordeaux 
by goblets, plying knife and fork with joyous 
and undiminished vigour. 

The tall one with the crisp hair and clear, 
grayish eyes he of the three chickens 
was already achieving the third a crisply 
browned bird, fresh from the spit, fragrant 
and smoking hot. At intervals he buttered 
great slices of rye bread, or disposed of an 
entire young potato, washing it down with a 
goblet of red wine, but always he returned 
to the rich roasted fowl which he held, still 
impaled upon its spit, and which he carved 









as he ate, wings, legs, breast falling in steam 
ing flakes under his skillful knife blade.
