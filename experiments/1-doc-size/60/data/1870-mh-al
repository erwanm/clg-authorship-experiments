“You never saw another creature so altered as she is,” Mrs. Sutton
bewailed to Rosa, in rehearsing the scene. “If this thing should turn
out to be true, she is ruined and heart-broken for life. She will
become a cold, cynical, unfeeling woman--a feminine copy of her granite
brother.”

“If!” reiterated Rosa, testily. “There is not one syllable of truth in
it from Alpha to Omega! I know he is your nephew, and that it is one af
the Medo-Persian laws of Ridgeley that the king can do no wrong; but
I would sooner believe that Winston Aylett invented the slander
throughout, than question Fred Chilton’s integrity. There is foul play
somewhere, as you will discover in time--or out of it!”

To Mabel, Frederic’s spirited champion said never a word of the event
that held their eyes waking until dawn--each motionless as sleepless
lest her bed fellow should discover her real state.

“I have had no share in causing the rupture. I am not called upon to
heal it,” meditated she. “In this, the law of self-preservation is my
surest guide.”

Her resolve to remain neutral was sharply and unexpectedly tested the
next afternoon.

The two girls went out for a ramble about four o’clock, taking the
beaten foot-path that led through cultivated fields, and between wooded
hills, to a small post-town two miles distant. The day was sunless, but
not chilly, and when they had outwalked the hearing of the murmur of
rural life that pervaded the barnyard and adjacent “quarters,” the
silence was oppressive, except when broken by the whirr of a partridge,
the melancholy caw of the crows, scared from their feast upon the
scattered grains knocked from over-ripe ears of corn during the recent
“fodder-pulling,” and, as they neared it, by the fretting of a rapid
brook over its stony bottom.

The pretence of social converse had been given up before the friends
cleared the first field beyond the orchard. Rosa’s exquisite tact
withheld her from obtruding commonplaces upon the attention of a mind
torn by suspense--distracted between disappointment and outraged pride,
and Mabel had not besought her sympathy in her grievous strait. They
walked on swiftly, the one staring straight forward, yet seeing
nothing; the other, although thoughtful, losing not one feature of
the landscape--the light-gray sky, the encircling forest, the yellow
broom-straw clothing the hill-sides, the crooked fences, lined with
purple brush, golden-rod, black-bearded alder and sumach, flaming with
scarlet berry cones and motley leaves. It was her principle and habit to
seize upon whatever morsels of delight were dropped in her way, and she
had a taste for attractive bits of scenery, as for melody. There was no
reason why the evil estate of her companion should debar her from quiet
enjoyment of the autumn day. She was sorry that Mabel was suffering.
It was unpleasant to see pain or grief. Smiles were prettier than glum
looks. She hoped she had enough humanity about her to enable her to
recognize these facts. But, in her soul, she despised the girl for her
tacit acquiescence in her brother’s decree; contemned her yet more for
her partial credence of the rumor of her lover’s unworthiness. It was as
well, taking these things into account, that Mabel was not communicative
with regard to the great change that had befallen her since this
hour yesterday, when she had exultingly proclaimed that her trust was
“founded upon a rock.”
