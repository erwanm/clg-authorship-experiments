“On that ground,” the banker interposed, “you could say that political
economy was a fit subject for art, if an artist chose to treat it.”

“It would have its difficulties,” the painter admitted, “but there
are certain phases of political economy, dramatic moments, human
moments, which might be very fitly treated in art. For instance, who
would object to Mr. Twelvemough’s describing an eviction from an East
Side tenement-house on a cold winter night, with the mother and her
children huddled about the fire the father had kindled with pieces of the
household furniture?”

“I should object very much, for one,” said the lady who had
objected to the account of the surgical operation. “It would be too
creepy. Art should give pleasure.”

“Then you think a tragedy is not art?” asked the painter.

“I think that these harrowing subjects are brought in altogether too
much,” said the lady. “There are enough of them in real life, without
filling all the novels with them. It’s terrible the number of beggars
you meet on the street, this winter. Do you want to meet them in Mr.
Twelvemough’s novels, too?”

“Well, it wouldn’t cost me any money there. I shouldn’t have to give.”

“You oughtn’t to give money in real life,” said the lady. “You ought to
give charity tickets. If the beggars refuse them, it shows they are
impostors.”

“It’s some comfort to know that the charities are so active,” said the
elderly young lady, “even if half the letters one gets do turn out
to be appeals from them.”

“It’s very disappointing to have them do it, though,” said the artist,
lightly. “I thought there was a society to abolish poverty. That doesn’t
seem to be so active as the charities this winter. Is it possible they’ve
found it a failure?”

“Well,” said Mr. Bullion, “perhaps they have suspended during the hard
times.”

They tossed the ball back and forth with a lightness the Americans have,
and I could not have believed, if I had not known how hardened people
become to such things here, that they were almost in the actual presence
of hunger and cold. It was within five minutes’ walk of their warmth and
surfeit; and if they had lifted the window and called, “Who goes there?”
 the houselessness that prowls the night could have answered them from the
street below, “Despair!”

“I had an amusing experience,” Mr. Twelvemough began, “when I was doing a
little visiting for the charities in our ward, the other winter.”

“For the sake of the literary material?” the artist suggested.

“Partly for the sake of the literary material; you know we have to look
for our own everywhere. But we had a case of an old actor’s son, who had
got out of all the places he had filled, on account of rheumatism, and
could not go to sea, or drive a truck, or even wrap gas-fixtures in paper
any more.”
