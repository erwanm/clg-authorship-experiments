wariness she ceased even her inward interrogation, to let 
him get hold of himself. 

" I guess your aunt don't mean to come down to sup- 
per," she volunteered. " I'll leave out the biscuits. 
'Twon't hurt 'em to dry off a little. I didn't think they 
were extra good, — not so good as Hannah's." 

Hugh plunged his hand into his pocket and brought 
out a wad of money. 

" Mother," said he, "here's six dollars. I want you 
to give it to her." 

"Who?" Mary stopped in her progress to-and-fro.

" they never do anything." 



 

He stuffed the money into his pocket again, and went 
off with a striding step, too much, Mary heavily felt, like 
his father's when circumstance had briefly withstood him. 
She stayed looking at the place where he had been, her 
mind a tumult of remonstrance against the nature of man 
and its ingratitude. She was standing by Hugh, against 
his will, and he was throwing off her compassion with a 
hopeless word. The tears rushed to her eyes, surprising 
her* She was not used to their traitorous overflow. She 
wiped them away, threw a shawl over her shoulders and, 
leaving the dishes for Hannah, went out of the kitchen 
and down the path into the road, to do her errand at 
the little house. It seemed rather foolish to go into the
