insist upon being paid, as there was now no hope 
that the debtor, in prison, would be able to do any- 
thing. Lawry told her that the steamboat would 
enable them to pay all claims upon his father. 

Mrs. Wilford had but little confidence in her son's 
schemes, but she did not discoui'age them ; and 
Lawry racked his brain for expedients to accom- 
plish the task he had imposed upon himself. He 
had no money, and he was too proud to ask Mr. 
Sherwood for the assistance which that gentleman 
would so gladly have rendered. Ethan French came 
down to see him every day, and the prairie boy was 
so kind and considerate that they soon became fast 
friends. 





 



" When are you going to work on the steamer, 
Lawry?" asked Ethan, two or three days after the 
arrest of the ferryman. " I suppose yoxi don't feel 
much like meddling with her yet." 

"I don't; but she ought to be raised as soon as 
possible," replied Lawry. " I am going to work 
upon her right off. I went down to see how she lies 
this morning, and I have got my plans all laid." 

" Have you ?" 

" I have." 

" Do you think you can get her up ? " 
" I know I can." 

" Well, how are you going to do it ? " inquired 
Ethan, delighted with the spirit of his companion. 

" Do you know Mr. Nelson, over at Pointville ? I 
suppose you don't. Well, he is a great oil man; he 
has got some oil wells down on the St. Johns River. 
He is getting together all the barrels and hogsheads 
he can find, to send down to his works. He has 
as many as a hundred at his place in Pointville. I'm 
going to borrow a lot of these casks, if I can, and 
raise the Woodville with them." 

" How are you going to manage with them ? " 
asked Ethan, deeply interested in the plan.
