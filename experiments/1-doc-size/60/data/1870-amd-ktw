her aunt, as if he wondered what they were doing 
there. 

“ Don’t you think Uncle Bobert stays a long 
while ? ” Katliie whispered, timidly. 

“ He will be here in a moment,” was the reply. 

The cars gave a lurch and started on. Katliie 
turned pale, but before she could speak they stopped. 

“ O Aunt Butli, what if we were to be taken on 


somewhere ? ” 


 


“ We shall not be ” ; and Aunt Ruth smiled. 

“If Uncle Robert only would come!” 

“There he is.” 

Sure enough, smiling gayly as if he had not been 
away more than a moment. 

“ O Uncle Robert, I thought you were lost!” 

He patted the perplexed little face. “ I should 
have to take leave of my senses first, before I could 
be lost in New York. Now, if you will carry the 
shawls, I ’ll take Aunt Ruth in my arms. Oh, here ’s 
her crutch too. I will come back after that.” 

Kathie followed down the long platform. A 
driver was holding open the coach door, and Uncle 
Robert placed the invalid tenderly within. Then he 
handed up Kathie and sprang after them, and the 
door shut with a click. Off they rolled. Kathie 
glanced out of the window. 

“ Oh Uncle Robert, doesn’t it look queer ? 
What lots and lots of houses ! And how we do 

joggle ! Won’t it hurt Aunt Ruth ? ” 

“It will be easier when we turn out of this 
street.” 

“ Uncle Robert, where do all the people come 
from ? ” 



He laughed. “Why, the streets are quite thin 
now ! An hour or two later and there will be a 
crowd.”
