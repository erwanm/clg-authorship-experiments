looked before and behind and all round to the right, and the other
looked before and behind and all round at the left; and in each wall
were two hundred eyes."

The Captain smiled to himself to see Daisy's face at this statement,
though outwardly he kept perfectly grave. Daisy's own simple orbs were
so full and intent. She looked from him to the fossil.

"But Capt. Drummond----" she began slowly.

"Well, Daisy? After you have done, I shall begin."

"Did you say that this thing lived at the bottom of the sea?"

"Precisely."

"But then how could he get up here?"

"Forgive me, Daisy," said the Captain involuntarily "You know you told
me you were a soldier."

Daisy's heart was very tender, and she had been living all the morning
in that peculiar nearness to Christ which those know who suffer for him.
She looked at the Captain, and burst into tears.

"You told me you were a soldier--" he repeated, not quite knowing what

"O Capt. Drummond!" said Daisy weeping,--"I wish you were!"

It stung the Captain. He knew what she meant. But he quietly asked her
