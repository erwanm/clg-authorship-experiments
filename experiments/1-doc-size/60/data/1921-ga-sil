to her martial ancestors ; but as the sideboards were built 
into the walls and could be replaced only at great cost 
they remained as a brooding reminder of the solid sixties, and no doubt exchanged resentful reminiscences 
at night with the chairs which had been merely recovered. 

As a matter of course modern bathtubs were installed 
and gas replaced by electricity. 

All this made a "hole" in Alexina's bonds, the wedding-present of her brothers, but Mortimer offered no 
objection, knowing as he did that to achieve his ambition 
of being master of a house to which fashionable people 
would come as a matter of course the outlay was imperative. Moreover, entertaining at home would be far 
cheaper for him than at the restaurants. 

He was doing fairly well at this time, for he had 
learned what commodities the retail men were likely to 
buy of a firm as small as his, and he had got into touch 
with one or two foreign markets not monopolized by the 
older houses. Moreover, he had been speculating a little 
in the new Nevada mines, and successfully. He pre- 
sented Alexina with a Victrola which included the music 
for all the new dances, and a long coat of baby lamb 
lined with her favorite periwinkle blue. To his sister 
he returned a thousand dollars of her money. 

Alexina knew nothing of these speculations and felt 
that her original faith in him was justified. He did not 
offer even yet to pay all the monthly expenses of the house, 
explaining casually that the greater part of his profits 
went back into the business; but he handed over his 
share promptly, and such fleeting doubts and anxieties 



 

as may once have visited his still inexperienced wife 
faded and finally disappeared. 



 

They began to entertain a little during the second winter, Mrs. Grroome having been dead nearly two years. 
The new floor of the large drawing-room had been laid 
for dancing, and their friends formed a habit, when 
there was "nothing on" elsewhere, of telephoning and 
announcing they were coming up to take a whirl. This 
led to more telephoning, and some twenty couples would 
dance in the long-silent old house at least once and often 
three times a week. 

The new order delighted James, who felt young again, 
and his hastily improvised suppers were models of unpretentious succulence. There were always sherry and 
whiskey in the handsome old decanters on the sideboards ; 
and, at the equally perfect little dinners, for a time, 
two bottles of Alexander Groome's favorite brand of 
champagne (which he had remembered with satisfaction 
on his deathbed that he had not outlived) were brought 
up from the cellar by the beaming James.
