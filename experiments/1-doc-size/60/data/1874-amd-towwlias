might have come to their assistance. How it humbled her! She even
shrank away from her husband's eyes.

"I think Granny is growing weary," Hal said presently, glancing at the
pallid cheek. "She has had a great deal of excitement to-day; and now,
if you will come up stairs and look at my flowers, we can let her have
a little rest."

They all agreed to the proposal.

So Hal gave her a composing draught; and, though Joe was fain to stay,
Granny sent him away with the others. They had all been so good, that
she, surely, must not be selfish; and, truth to tell, a little quiet
would not come amiss.

For, happy dream! she had lived to see them all come back. What more
could she ask? That she might recover her health, and feast on their
smiles and joyousness; and she prayed humbly to God that it might be
so, in his great mercy.




CHAPTER XX.

  WHEREIN THE OLD SHOE BECOMES CROWDED.


They trooped up the narrow stairs. Why, the old loom-room looked like a
palace! Hal had made some very pretty brackets out of pine, and stained
them; and they were ranged round the wall, upholding a pot of flowers
or trailing vines, and two or three little plaster casts. Here were
some bookshelves, the table surmounted by a very passable writing-desk,
Hal's construction also. But the flowers were a marvel.

"Hal's dream was a green-house," exclaimed Florence. "But I don't see
how you found time for it all"--

"It has been profit as well as pleasure," said Hal with a little
pride. "Last winter I sold a quantity of flowers, and, in the spring,
bedding-plants and garden vegetables."

"Oh!" returned Florence, choking back the sobs, "do you remember one
summer day, long, long ago, when we all told over what we would like to
have happen to us? And it has all come about."

"Even to my fiddle," said Kit.

"And my running away," appended Charlie with great satisfaction.

Hal brought in some chairs.

"We're going to sit in the corner on the floor," said Charlie; and the
three younger ones ranged themselves in a small group.

Florence and her husband walked round to view the flowers, guided by
Joe.

"You appear to have wonderful success," remarked Mr. Darol. "These
tuberoses are very fine."
