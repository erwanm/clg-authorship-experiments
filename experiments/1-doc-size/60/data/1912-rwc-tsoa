"Why not?"

"Because--the fact is--I believe I practically--so to speak--hit him."

"What!"

"Fact, old chap."

"Why?"

"Well, he asked me if I knew more about anything than I did about
pictures. I didn't catch his drift for about an hour--but then it came
to me, and I got up out of my chair and walked over and punched his
head. I don't think he'll come back, do you?"

"No, I don't. What else have you been doing?" said Quarren angrily.

"Nothing. One picture--the Raeburn portrait--has a bad hole in it."

"How did it happen?"

"Rather extraordinary thing, that! I was giving a most respectable card
party--some ladies and gentlemen of sorts--from the Winter Garden I
believe--and one of the ladies inadvertently shyed a glass at another
lady----"

"For Heaven's sake, Dankmere----"

"Quite right old chap--my fault entirely--I won't do it again. But, do
you know, the gallery already has become a most popular resort. People
are coming and going all day--a lot of dealers among them I suspect--and
there have been a number of theatrical people who want to hire pictures
for certain productions to be staged next winter----"

"We don't do that sort of thing!"

"That's what I thought; but there was one very fetching girl who opens
in 'Ancestors' next October----"

"No, no, no!"

"Right-o! I'll tell her at luncheon.... I say, Quarren: Karl Westguard
wants the gallery to-night. May I let him have it?"

"Certainly. What for?"

"Oh, some idea of his--I've forgotten what he said."

"I believe I'd better come down," said Quarren bluntly.

"Don't dream of it, old fellow. Everything is doing nicely. My respects
to the fair. By-the-bye--anything in my line up there?"

Quarren laughed:

"I'm afraid not, Dankmere."

"Very well," said the Earl, airily. "I'm not worrying now, you know.
Good-bye, old sport!"
