with assenting nods that culminated in a spoken 
expression of his willingness to undertake the trans- 
lations. March waited with a sort of mechanical 
expectation of his gratitude for the work put in his 
way, but nothing of the kind came from Lindau, 
and March was left to say, " Well, everything is 
understood, then ; and I don't know that I need 
add that if you ever want any little advance on the 
work " 

" I will ask you," said Lindau quietly, " and I 
thank you for that. But I can wait ; I ton't needt 
any money just at bresent." As if he saw some 
appeal for greater frankness in March's eye, he went 
on : "I tidn't gome here begause I was too boor to 
lif anywhere else, and I ton't stay in pedt begause 
I couldn't haf a fire to gecp warni if I wanted it- 
I 'm nodt zo padt off as Marmontel when he went to 
Paris. ? 'm a lidtle loaxurious, that is all. If I stay 
in pedt it's zo I can fling money away on some- 
things else. Heigh ? " 

" But what are you living here for, Lindau ? " 
March smiled at the irony lurking in Lindau's 
words. 

" Well, you zee, I foundt I was begoming a lidtle 
too moch of an aristograt. I hadt a room oap in 
Creenvidge Willage, among dose pig pugs over on 
the west side, and I foundt" — Lindau's voice lost 



 

its jesting quality, and his face darkened — " that I 
was beginning to forget the boor ! " 

" I should have thought," said March, with im- 
l)artial interest, " that you might have seen poverty 
enough, now and then, in Greenwich Village to 
remind you of its existence." 

" Nodt like here," said Lindau. " Andt you must 
zee it all the dtime — zee it, hear it, smell it, dtaste 
it — or you forget it. That is what I gome here for. 
I was begoming a ploated aristograt. I thought I 
was nodt like these beople down here, when I gome 
down once to look aroundt ; I thought I must be 
somethings else, and zo I zaid I better take myself 
in time, and I gome here among my brothers — the 
beccars and the tliiefs ! " A noise made itself heard 
in the next room, as if the door were furtively 
opened, and a faint sound of tiptoeing and of hands 
clawing on a table. " Thiefs ! " Lindau repeated, 
with a shout. "Lidtle thiefs, that gabture your 
breakfast. Ah ! ha ! ha ! " A wild scurrying of 
feet, joyous cries and tittering, and a slamming door 
followed upon his explosion, and he resumed in the 
silence: "Idtis the children cot pack from school.
