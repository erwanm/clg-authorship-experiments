was always carefully rolled, was as white as sea 
foam. Betty would not permit her to wear black, but 
dressed her in delicate colors, and she looked somewhat like an animated miniature. She dabbed impatiently at her tears. 

" Everybody will cut you if you go into that 
dreadful political set." 

" I am on the verge of cutting everybody myself, so 
it doesn't.matter. Positively I shall not accept an 
invitation of the old sort this winter. The sooner 
they drop me the better." 

Mrs. Madison wept bitterly. " You will become a 
notorious woman," she sobbed. " People will talk 
terribly about you. They will say all sorts of things 
I have heard come back to me these politicians make 
love to every pretty woman they meet. They are so tired 
of their old frumps from Oshkosh and Kalamazoo." 

"They do not all come from Oshkosh and Kalamazoo. There are six New England States whose 
three centuries you have just admitted lift them into 
the mists of antiquity. There are fourteen Southern 
States, and I need make no defence "

form. I don't pretend to hope that ninety representa- 
tive Americans are Beau Brummels, but there must be 
a respectable minority of gentlemen whether self- 
made or not I don't care. I am going to make a 
deliberate attempt to know that minority, and shall 
call on Lady Mary Montgomery this afternoon as the 
first step. So you are resigned, are you not, Molly 
dear?" 

"No, I am not! But what can I do? I have 
spoiled you, and you would be just the same if I hadn't. 
You are more like the men of the family than the 

women they always would have their own way. 
Are they all married?" she added anxiously. 

"Do you mean the ninety Senators and the three 
hundred and fifty-six Representatives? I am sure
