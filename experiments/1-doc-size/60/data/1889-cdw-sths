$10,570,933.22; amount of deposit with Government to guarantee three
per cent, on capital stock until August 17, 1893, $10,310,954.75. Total,
$191,571,517.48.
Without going into the financial statement, nor appending the leases
and guarantees, any further than to note that the capital stock
is $65,000,000 and the first mortgage bonds (five per cent.) are
$34,999,633, it is only necessary to say that in the report the capital
foots up $112,908,019. The total earnings for 1885 were $8,308,493; for
1886, $10,081,803; for 1887, $11,600,412, while the working expenses for
1887 were $8,102,294. The gross earnings for 1888 are about $14,000,000,
and the net earnings about $4,000,000. These figures show the steady
growth of business.
Being a Dominion road, and favored, the company had a monopoly in
Manitoba for building roads south of its line and roads connecting with
foreign lines. This monopoly was surrendered in 1887 upon agreement
of the Dominion Government to guarantee 3 1/2 per cent, interest on
$15,000,000 of the company’s land grant bonds for fifty years. The
company has paid its debt to the Government, partly by surrender of a
portion of its lands, and now absolutely owns its entire line free of
Government obligations. It has, however, a claim upon the Government of
something like six million dollars, now in litigation, on portions of
the mountain sections of the road built by the Government, which are not
up to the standard guaranteed in the contract with the company.
The road was extended to the Pacific as a necessity of the national
development, and the present Government is convinced that it is worth
to the country all it has cost. The Liberals’ criticism is that the
Government has spent a vast sum for what it can show no assets, and that
it has enriched a private company instead of owning the road itself. The
property is no doubt a good one, for the road is well built as to grades
and road-bed, excellently equipped, and notwithstanding the heavy Lake
Superior and mountain work, at a less cost than some roads that preceded
it.
The full significance of this transcontinental line to Canada, Great
Britain, and the United States will appear upon emphasizing the value of
the line across the State of Maine to connect with St. John and
Halifax; upon the fact that its western terminus is in regular steamer
communication with Hong-Kong via Yokohama; that the company is building
new and swift steamers for this line, to which the British Government
has granted an annual subsidy of £60,000, and the Dominion one of
$15,000; that a line will run from Vancouver to Australia; and that
a part of this round-the-world route is to be a line of fast steamers
between Halifax and England. The Canadian Pacific is England’s shortest
route to her Pacific colonies, and to Japan and China; and in case of a
blockade in the Suez Canal it would become of the first importance for
Australia and India. It is noted as significant by an enthusiast of
the line that the first loaded train that passed over its entire length
carried British naval stores transferred from Quebec to Vancouver, and
that the first car of merchandise was a cargo of Jamaica sugar refined
at Halifax and sent to British Columbia.
II.
We left Montreal, attached to the regular train, on the evening of
September 22d. The company runs six through trains a week, omitting the
despatch of a train on Sunday from each terminus. The time is six
days and rive nights. We travelled in the private ear of Mr. T. G.
Shaughnessy, the manager, who was on a tour of inspection, and took it
leisurely, stopping at points of interest on the way. The weather was
bad, rainy and cold, in eastern Canada, as it was all over New England,
and as it continued to be through September and October. During our
absence there was snow both in Montreal and Quebec. We passed out of the
rain into lovely weather north of Lake Superior; encountered rain again
