' I should not think any the worse of you,' said Hilda. ' It is 
I who have been foolish not to guess it before. How should you 
understand that I love you, merely because I say good morning 
and kiss you, and good evening and kiss you, and talk about the 
weather and your mother's ribbands ! There must be something 
more. And yet I feel that if you married some one else, I should 
be very unhappy and should perhaps die. Why not ? There would 
not be anything to live for. Why can I not find some way of 
letting you know how I love you ? There must be ways of showing 
it but I have thought of everything I can do for you, and it is 
so little, for you have everything. Only Greif, you must not 
doubt that I love you because I have no way of showing it or if 
you do 

' Forgive me, Hilda I never doubted 

' Oh, but you did, you did,' answered Hilda with great emphasis, 
and in a tone which showed how deeply the words had wounded 
her. ' It is natural, I suppose, and then, is it not better that I 
should know it ? It is of no use to hide such things. I should have 
felt it, if you had not told me.' 

It was not in Hilda's nature to shed tears easily, for she had 
been exposed to so few emotions in her life that she had never 
acquired the habit of weeping. But there was something in her 
expression that moved Greif more than a fit of sobbing could have 
done. There was an evident strength in her resentment, even 
though it showed itself in temperate words, which indicated a 
greater solidity of character than the young man had given her 
credit for. He had not realised that a love developed by natural 



and slow degrees, without a shadow of opposition, could be deeper 
and more enduring than the spasmodic passion that springs up 
amidst the unstable surroundings of the world, ill nourished by an 
uncertain alternation of hope and fear, and prone to consume itself 
in the heat of its own expression. The one is about as different 
from the other as the slowly moving glacier of the Alps is from 
the gaudily decorated and artificially frozen concoction of the ice- 
cream vendor. 

'I am very sorry I said it,' returned Greif penitently, He 
took her passive hand in his, hoping to make the peace as quickly 
as he had broken it, but she did not return the pressure of his 
fingers. 

' So am I,' she answered thoughtfully. ' I was angry at first. 
I do not think I am angry any more, but I cannot forget it, 
because, in some way or other, it must be my fault. Forgive you 
There is nothing to forgive, dear. Why should one not speak out 
what is in one's heart ? It would be a sort of lie, if one did not. 
I would tell you at once, if I thought you did not love me ' 

Greif smiled. 

' Ah Hilda ! Since we have been sitting here, you have told 
me you thought I might change do you not remember ? Was 
what I said so much worse than that ? '
