rity of young womanhood. 

A sorrow like this is hard to bear. It touches 
the very springs of life, and dashes their waters 
with bitterness. It weighs down the heart with a 
burden that makes every pulsation weak and 
painful. Clouds envelop the sun and the earth 
is in shadow. 

" If I could only see her in my dreams," said 
Mrs. Ellsworth to a friend, who had left the out 
side cheerful world, and come into the gloomy 



 

apartment where the bereaved one sat nursing her 
sorrow. " If I could only see her in my dreams, 
it would be something. But since the day her 
face was shut from me by the coffin lid, neither 
to outward sight nor inward vision has it again 
been visible. Through how many hours of the 
night have I kept awake, hoping that I'm ight see 
her in the darkness. I was not afraid. Dear, 
dear child ! She has gone from me as completely 
as if I were sailing over an ocean, and she had 
dropped down into its fathomless depths. Is 
there no return of our beloved? My faith begins 
to fail. I had not thought of the spiritual world 
as very distant. T had believed the separating 
veil but thin. Thought gives presence, and love 
conjunction, as to the spirit, whether we be in the 
body or out of the body ; so I had said, and so I 
had believed. But now I sit and think of Mar 
garet for hours, yet do not perceive her presence." 
The friend made no attempt to meet the state 
of Mrs. Ellsworth by theory or doctrine. She 
understood her case, and knew that there was no 



 

comfort in words. So after sitting silent for a. 
little while, she said 

" You knew Mrs. Garland ?" 

"Yes." 

" Have you heard about her ?" 

" No ! what about her ?" 

" Not that her husband was killed at Gettys 
burg?" 

" Why, no ! Killed at Gettysburg !"
