business-like tones.

"I want the best one you can get up. I want one as good or better than
this."

"I will build one as good as this. I will have it at your house on
Monday; but the price will be six dollars."

"Very well. I thought I should be able to buy this one for two or three
dollars before night, for I didn't think any one else would want it."

Probably the example of Mr. Checkynshaw had some influence on the
customer. If white mice and their habitations were really articles of
merchandise, he was willing to pay the market price. Leo wrote down his
name and residence, and assured the gentleman that he should have the
mice on Monday; or, if he got the house done, on Saturday.

"Don't you want an establishment of this kind, Baxter?" asked Mr.
Checkynshaw of a busy person who had worked his way through the crowd.
"You have two or three boys."

Mr. Baxter examined the palace and its denizens, and answered that he
did want one, though not till the banker informed him that he had
purchased one. It is wonderful how things sell after a great man has
purchased. The new customer did not want any two-dollar palaces; he
desired one as good as any other person had, and he gave his order
accordingly. If Mr. Checkynshaw was fool enough to pay six dollars for
such an establishment, Mr. Baxter could not suffer in reputation by
doing the same.

Leo was as happy as a lord. It was make, and not break.

"Leo," said the banker, "how is your father?"

"Better, sir, I thank you."

"I think I will go down and see him. He has shaved me for years. By the
way, is your sister--what's her name?"

"Maggie, sir."

"Is Maggie at home?"

"Yes, sir."

"I wish to see her very much," said Mr. Checkynshaw, walking away.

What could he want to see Maggie for? was Leo's thought, as he started
his team--Tom Casey--up State Street.




CHAPTER XVI.

THE LETTER FROM MARGUERITE.


Mr. Checkynshaw walked down to No. 3 Phillimore Court. It was very
plain that he had business there, for it was not his style to visit a
