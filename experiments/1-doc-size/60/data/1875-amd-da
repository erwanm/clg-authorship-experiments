place called Woodlea? Did you know his wife?" 
. u No, he has been married since we went abroad." 

Then she glanced questioningly at her daughter. 
Mrs. Merrivour was in a state of the most superb indif- 
ference. 

" You will see him, if he is your only connection?" 

This was partly question, partly assertion. 

U I do not know — that is — " and the little lady 
paused, confused. 

" Mamma means, I suppose, if he deigns to call us 
to remembrance," Mrs. Merrivour said softly. 

Jasper Cameron ran over the ground like a mental

There was a silence that would have been awkward 
but for Mrs. Merrivour's superb self-possession. She 
waved her mourning fan with rare grace, and glanced 
indifferently about her. 

Mrs. Lester felt very uncomfortable, Ralph Tre- 
maine was a sort of tabooed subject between mother 
and daughter, and here she was deep in it, unwittingly. 
She had an old, tender regard for Ralph. 

"Have you met her?" she asked timidly. 

"Yes, since my return, and seven years ago, before 
I left America. Indeed there is a strange and painful
