matters," protested Steele, smarting under her 
lashing words. " We are busy men. We can- 
not attend to these details. How should we 
know where our subjects come from? The 
experiments must go on. You take a very 
feminine view of the circumstances." 
" I wouldn't be a man — such a man — do 
such a thing — make such an excuse for a deed 
like this — not for all that you call fame ! " 
He reddened painfully under her scorn. 
" You set the animal above the human race ! " 
he cried. 
" What if it had been Barry? "interrupted 
Miriam quietly. 
Steele's eyelids almost imperceptibly 
drooped, but his dogmatic voice pushed on : 
" What is one dog — what are ten thou- 
sand dogs compared with the life of one 
baby ? " he demanded fiercely. 
Miriam now turned her averted head, and, 
 
for the first time that morning I looked him 
straight in the eyes. The misery in them held 
her rising denunciation back. 
" You have tormented many dogs. How 
many, I do not want to know. Have you ever 
saved the life of one baby ? Oh, I have seen 
men do that, down among' my poor people — 
good plain doctors — kind men, giving their 
lives for sick children. How many did you 
say you have saved ? " 
" But I might have ! I should have. I 
was on the eve of great discoveries. This 
unfortunate mishap has overthrown them 
all." 
Miriam's tender lip curled. This was a 
sight that he had never seen before, and it 
forced this outcry from him : " Your judgment 
is distorted ! You set that creature above me. 
You value him more than you value me. You 
care for him more ! " 
" Why should I dispute you ? It is quite 
true that I love my dog more than it is pos- 
sible for any one who could — treat him — as 
you have done — to understand." 
" You never loved me ! " Steele vehemently 
challenged her. 
 
" Oh, I thought I did," she answered 
drearily. " Don't blame me. I thought I 
did." * 
The man arose. The muscles of his face 
were taut. 
" Do you mean to say that you will allow 
this to come between us ? " 
" How can I help it ? " she cried. " I loved 
another kind of man." 
Steele strode up and down the room. His 
strong head, his stern chin, his professional 
bearing seemed to have no part in the turmoil
