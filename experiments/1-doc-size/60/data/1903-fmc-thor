was far too high for that. 

Malipieri calculated that if Sassi were punctual, 
Sabina would be at the door of the palace at a quarter- 
past five. At five minutes past, he came down, and 
sent the porter on an errand which would occupy at 



 

least half an hour even if executed with despatch. 
Masin would keep the door, he said. The old man was 
delighted to have an excuse for going out, and promised 
himself to spend a comfortable hour in a wine shop if he 
could find a friend. His wife, as there was so little to 
do, had found some employment in a laundry, to which 
she went in the morning and which kept her out all 
day. No one would see Sabina and Sassi enter, and if 
it seemed advisable they could be got out in the same 
way. No one biit Masin and Malipieri himself need 
ever know that they had been in the palace that 
afternoon. 

It was all very well prepared, by a man well accus- 
tomed to emergencies, and it was not easy to see how 
anything could go wrong. Even allowing more time 
than was necessary, Sabina's visit to the vaults could 
not possibly occupy much more than an hour. 



CHAPTER XII 

Malipibri was beginning to realize that his work in 
the vaults had been watched with much more interest 
than he had supposed possible, and that in some way or 
other news of his progress had reached various quarters. 
In the first place, his reputation was much wider than 
he knew, and many scholars and archaeologists through- 
out Europe had been profoundly impressed both by 
what he had discovered and by the learning he had 
shown in discussing his discoveries. It followed that 
many were curious to see what he would do next, and 
there were paragraphs about him in grave reviews, and 
flattering references to him in speeches made at learned 
conventions. He had friends whose names he had 
never heard, and enemies, too, ready to attack him on 
the one side and to defend him on the other. Some 
praised his modesty, and others called it affectation. 
His experience of the wider world was short, so far, and 
he did not understand that it had taken people a year 
to appreciate his success. He had hoped for immediate 
recognition of his great services to archseology, and had 
been somewhat disappointed because that recognition 
had not been instantaneous. Like most men of supe- 
rior talent, in the same situation, when praise came in 
due time and abundantly, he did not care for it because
