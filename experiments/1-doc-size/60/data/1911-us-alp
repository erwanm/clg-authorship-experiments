"And you know nothing of the pain that it cost! 
You have no sense of the strangeness of it ! You never 
think what your coming meant to some woman!" 

And then in the seat opposite was a woman ; and 
Thyrsis watched her. 

"You!" he thought, "a woman! Can it be that you 
know what you are? The fate that you play with 
the power that dwells in you ! To create new life, that 
may be handed down through endless ages !" 

Thyrsis did not say these things ; they were what 
he wanted to say what he thought that he ought to 
say. But then he reminded himself that these things 
were forbidden ; these mighty facts of child-birth, of 
life-creation they might not be spoken about! They 



 

must be kept hidden, veiled with mystery if one wished 
to refer to them, he must employ metaphors and polite 
evasions. 

And as Thyrsis sat and thought about this, he 
clenched his hands. Some day the world would hear 
about it some day the world would think about it ! 
Some day people would behold life would realize what 
it was and what it meant. They did not realize it now 
else how could it be that women, who bore the race 
with so much pain and sorrow, should be drudges and 
slaves, or the ornaments and playthings of men? Else 
how could it be that life, which cost such a fearful price, 
should be so cheap upon the earth? For every man 
that lived and walked alive, some woman had had to 
bear this agony ; and yet men were pent up in mines 
and sweatshops, they were ground up in accidents in 
factories and mills nay, worse than that, were dressed 
up in gaudy uniforms, and armed with rifles and ma- 
chine-guns, and marched out to slaughter each other 
by tens and hundreds of thousands ! 

So, as he walked the streets that night, Thyrsis 
made a vow. Some day he would put before the world 
this vision that had come to him, some day he would 
blast men's souls with it. He would shake them with 
this horror, he would thrill them with this sense of the 
infinite preciousness and holiness of life! He would 
drive it into them like a barbed arrow that never 
afterwards in all their lives would they be rid of. 
Never afterwards would they dare to mock, never 
afterwards would they be able to rest until these things 
had been done away with, until these horrors had been 
driven from the earth.
