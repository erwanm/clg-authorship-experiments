play." And then she went on to explain to him the 
conditions of success in the business of the theatre. 

Thyrsis listened, with a clutch as of ice about his 
heart. "I am very sorry, Miss Lewis," he said, at last 
"but I couldn't possibly do what you ask." 

"Couldn't do it !" cried the other, amazed. 

"It would not fit into my idea at all." 

"But, don't you want to get your play produced?" 

"That's just it, I want to get my play produced. If 
I did what you want me to, it wouldn't be my play. 
It would be somebody else's play." 

And there he stood. The actress argued with him 
and protested. She showed him what a great chance he 
had here one that came to a new and unknown writer 
but once in a lifetime. Here was a manager ready to 
give him a good contract, and to put his play on at 
once in a Broadway theatre ; and here was a public 
favorite anxious to have the leading role. It would be 
everything he could ask it would be fame and fortune 
at one stroke. But Thyrsis only shook his head he 
could not do it. He was almost sick with disappoint- 
ment ; but it was a situation in which there was no use 
trying to compromise he simply could not make a 
"love-story" out of "The Genius". 

So at last there came a silence between them there 
being nothing more for Miss Lewis to say. 

"Then I suppose you won't want the play," said 
Thyrsis, faintly. 

"I don't know," she answered, with vexation. "I'll 
have to think about it again, and talk to my manager. 
I had not counted on such a possibility as this." 

And so they left it, and Thyrsis went away. The 
next morning he received a letter from "Robertson 
Jones, Inc.", asking him to call at once. 



 

3. ROBERTSON JONES, the great "theatrical pro- 
ducer", was large and ponderous, florid of face and firm 
in manner the steam-roller type of business-man. And 
it became evident at once that he had invited Thyrsis 
to come and be rolled.
