"They do that, I think. But I do not know that 
it is a specially happy place." 

"Why not?" 

" I do not know. I used to think it was pretty 
fair, as places go. Now, since I have been stay 
ing in Philadelphia, it seems to me the life there is 
very narrow." 

"Narrow, how do you mean?" said Mrs. Ire- 
dell; but not inquisitorially ; only with a sort of 
kind, genial interest to which my heart opened. 
Mr. Iredell was sitting by, but he said nothing. 

" I mean, mentally narrow; moving within small 
limits. Since I came here, it seems to me as if my 



 

thoughts had got wings, and had flown up over 
Rome high mountain barrier that shut me in, not 
in the Happy Valley of llasselas," I added laughing. " And now I seem to have got a look over the 
mountains, and I begin to see what a wide place 
the world is, and what things are in it; things of 
which Chesterfield has no knowledge or notion." 

"That must have been a pleasant experience," 
said Mrs. Iredell smiling; "to get a look over 
those mountains." 

"Yes" said I, "very; if I did not look forward to living behind them to living in Chesterfield, the rest of my life." 

"What has wrought this enlargement of your 
vision? what about Philadelphia has had such a 
happy effect ? . Can you trace it to anything in 
particular ? " 

"Yes " said I, hesitating. And now I did not 
exactly want to speak out my thought ; but after 
all, it seemed the best and simplest thing to do. 
So I went on. "It came from hearing Mr. Iredell's talk, more than anything else." 

"Max," said the old lady smiling, "you have a 
good deal to answer for." 

"0 I am very glad of it," I hastened to say; 
"very glad. Even if I do spend all my life in 
Chesterfield, I am glad to have had a glimpse of 
what there is in the world beside. To have seen 
this place, for instance, will always be a great 
treasure in my memory." 

" It pleases you ? "
