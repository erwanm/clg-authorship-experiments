senator himself entered the room. 

" Ah ! Captain Somers, I am delighted to see you ! ' 
said he with enthusiasm, as he extended his hand, 
which our hero as warmly grasped. 

" Thank you, sir. I have called to express my obli- 
gations to you for all your kindness to me and to my 
friend. Major de Banyan wished to be kindly remem- 
bered to you." 



 

" I am happy to hear from the major ; and as for the 
rest, I feel that I have not yet begun to discharge my 
obligation to you. Why didn't you write to me before?" 

" I did not wish to burden you with any remembrance 
of such a humble individual as myself." 

" You are too modest by half, Captain Somers. I 
should not have known any thing about you if it hadn't 
been for General well, no matter who," laughed the 
senator. 

" Now, papa, you have cut short the most interesting 
story that ever was told ! " interposed Emma. 

" The captain must begin again, then. Of course, you 
will make my house your home while in the city." 

" Thank you, sir. I left my servant at the hotel." 

Senator Guilford insisted on sending for the servant 
and the baggage ; and, in half an hour, Alick was present 
to confirm the wonderful tale which Somers told of his 
captivity in Petersburg, to which Emma and her father 
listened with the most intense interest. 

Very much to his surprise, Captain Somers found him- 
self quite a lion in Washington. He was introduced to 
senators and representatives ; and on the following even- 
ing actually took the President of the United States by 
the hand, just as though he had been one of the patri- 
archs of Pinchbrook. 

In spite of all these brilliant surroundings, Somers 
was anxious to get home. He was too feeble to endure 


the excitement of the capital ; and, on the third day afte> 
his arrival, he started for home. When he reached 
Boston, by an unfortunate chance it was two hours 
before a train would start for Pinchbrook. As he had 
spent two days with a senator in Washington, and 
shaken hands with the President, he deemed himself 
qualified to call at No. , Rutland Street, where the 
carriage soon set him down.
