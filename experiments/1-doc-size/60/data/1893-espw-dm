" Here 's to happy Harle 
Drink her down! " 

Many a climate-worn, sorrow-soured woman, 
lank of face and lean of heart, breathed 
little spots in the frosted window, to see the 
stranger lad go by, and felt the warmer,

two from New York, she said, and besides, 
there was a postal from Fay. 

" She 's coming home to-day," observed 
the postmistress, as she handed the mail out. 
Don expressed no surprise at this. It was 
always understood in East Tipton that the 
postmasters, especially when they were post 
mistresses, read the postal cards. Fay used
