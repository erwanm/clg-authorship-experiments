"Your mother was glad of any excuse. And it 
will do us all good, if we take it in the right way," 
said the judge, with a didactic severity that did not 
hide his pang from her. 

" Poor poppa !" she said. 

He went away, saying that he was going to look 
Lottie up. His simple design was to send Lottie 
to her mother, so that Breckon might come back to 
Ellen ; but he did not own this to himself. 

Lottie returned from another direction with 
Boyne, and Ellen said, " Poppa 's gone to look for 
you." 

"Has he?" asked Lottie, dropping decisively into 
her chair. " Well, there 's one thing ; I won 't call 
him poppa any more." 

"What will you call him?" Boyne demanded, 
demurely. 

" I 'll call him father, if you want to know ; and 
I 'm going to call momma mother. I 'm not going 
to have those English laughing at us, and I won 't 
say papa and mamma. Everybody that knows any 
thing says father and mother now." 

Boyne kept looking from one sister to another 
during Lottie 's declaration, and, with his eyes on 
Ellen, he said, "It 's true, Ellen. All the Plump- 
tons did." He was very serious. 

Ellen smiled. " I 'm too old to change. I d rather 
 



 

seem queer in Europe than when I get back to 
Tuskingum." 

"You wouldn 't be queer there a great while," 
said Lottie. " They 'll all be doing it in a week 
after I get home." 

Upon the encouragement given him by Ellen, 
Boyne seized the chance of being of the opposition. 
"Yes," he taunted Lottie, "and you think they 'll 
say woman and man, for lady and gentleman, I 
suppose." 

" They will as soon as they know it 's the thing." 

"Well, I know I won t," said Boyne. "I won 't 
call momma a woman."
