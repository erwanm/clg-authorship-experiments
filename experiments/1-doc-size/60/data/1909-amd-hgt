relief in her voice. “ I’m so glad you do not 
write verses. And that we have only one poet 
in the school.” 

“ Why, I sometimes have made a verse that 
sounded real pretty, but I never could find the 
next one to go with it,” and she laughed in 
amusement. 

Helen laughed away her perplexity also. 

There were a few more calls, and her pack- 
ing to be done. She was to go to the city 




on Saturday. They would surely have some 
word about Dick in the morning. She was 
really getting very tired and wanted a rest. 

Mr. Underwood came up in the morning. 
They were to start at ten. He had a brief note 
in his hand from Mr. Eastman. 

The operation had taken place on Thursday 
and they found the damage to the spinal verte- 
brae had been worse than they suspected. Dick 
had come out of it bravely, but was so very 
weak the doctor hardly left him a moment, 
and was not willing to predict the result at 
present. 

The quick, sympathetic tears came to Helen’s 
eyes. “ Mrs. Underwood and I have been hav- 
ing one big thanksgiving that we shall not lose 
you. Have a good time in vacation and come 
back bright and rested. Dick is in God’s hands 
and we can’t change anything. Strange, but I 
believe we have all come to love the lad.” 

The expressman had come for her trunk 
and Lilian went about with a very sober 
face. 

Mr. Hildreth called presently. 

“ I’ve telegraphed to Mr. Bell that you will 


 

start at three and he will meet you,' he an- 
nounced. 

“ Why — I was to leave at one-thirty.” 

“ I want you for a little drive. I have some- 
thing to say before you go.”
