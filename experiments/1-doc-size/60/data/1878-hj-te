if to beg him not to prolong an anomalous sit- 
uation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his name. 
Eugenia gave him a very charming glance, and 
then looked at the other gentleman. 

This latter personage was a man of rather less 
than the usual stature and the usual weight, with 
a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a small 
quantity of thin dark hair, and a small mustache. 
He had been standing with his hands in his 
pockets ; and when Eugenia looked at him he 
took them out. But he did not, like Mr. Brand, 
look evasively and urgently at their host. He 
met Eugenia's eyes ; he appeared to appreciate 
the privilege of meeting them. Madame Minister 
instantly felt that he was, intrinsically, the most 
important person present. She was not uncon-

toward the Baroness with a light, quick step, and 
with perfect self-possession, rolling her stocking 
round its needles. She had dark blue eyes and 
dark brown hair; she was wonderfully pretty. 

Eugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other 
young women, and then held her off a little, look- 
ing at her. "Now this is quite another type" she 
said ; she pronounced the word in the French man- 
ner. " This is a different outline, my uncle, a dif- 
ferent character, from that of your own daughters. 
This, Felix," she went on, " is very much more 
what we have always thought of as the Amer- 
ican type." 

The young girl, during this exposition, was
