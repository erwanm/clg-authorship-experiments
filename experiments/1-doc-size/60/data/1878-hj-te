vation on the part of various nice-looking people 
who passed that way, and to whom a distinguished, 
strikingly-dressed woman with a foreign air, exclaiming upon the beauties of nature on a Boston 
street corner in the French tongue, could not be an 
object of indifference. Eugenia's spirits rose. She 
surrendered herself to a certain tranquil gayety. 
If she had come to seek her fortune, it seemed to 
her that her fortune would be easy to find. There 
was a promise of it in the gorgeous purity of the 
western sky ; there was an intimation in the mild, 
unimpertinent gaze of the passers of a certain natural facility in things. 

" You will not go back to Silberstadt, eh ? " 
asked Felix. 

" Not to-morrow," said the Baroness. 

" Nor write to the Reigning Prince ? " 



   

" I shall write to him that they evidently know 
nothing about him over here." 

" He will not believe you," said the young man. 
"I advise you to let him alone." 

Felix himself continued to be in high good humor. Brought up among ancient customs and in 
picturesque cities, he yet found plenty of local 
color in the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner, he told his sister that he should 
go forth early on the morrow to look up their cous- 
ins. 

" You are very impatient," said Eugenia. 

" What can be more natural," he asked, "after 
seeing all those pretty girls to-day ? If one's cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one knows them 
the better." 

"Perhaps they are not," said Eugenia. "We 
ought to have brought some letters to some 
other people." 

" The other people would not be our kinsfolk." 

"Possibly they would be none the worse for 
that," the Baroness replied. 

Her brother looked at her with his eyebrows 
lifted. " That was not what you said when you 
first proposed to me that we should come out here 
and fraternize with our relatives. You said that 
it was the prompting of natural affection; and 
when I suggested some reasons against it you 
declared that the voix du sang should go before 
everything." 

" You remember all that ? " asked the Baroness.
