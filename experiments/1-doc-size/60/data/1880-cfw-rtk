noring the coldness of his reception, came again and again. 
He even sought out Cousin Copeland in his study, and won 
the heart of the old bachelor by listening a whole morning to 
extracts from the documents. Gardis found that her reserve 
was of no avail against this bold young soldier, who followed 
her into all her little retreats, and paid no attention to her 
stinging little speeches. Emboldened and also angered by 
what she deemed his callousness, she every day grew more 
and more open in her tone, until you might have said that 
she, as a unit, poured out upon his head the whole bitterness 
of the South. Saxton made no answer until the time came 
for the camp to break up, the soldiers being ordered back to 
the city. Then he came to see her one afternoon, and sat for 





some time in silence ; the conversation of the little mistress 
was the same as usual. 

" I forgive this, and all the bitter things you have said to

and forlorn. 

Captain Newell took his leave a day later in a different 
fashion ; he told Miss Duke that he would leave a guard on 
the premises if she wished it. 

" I do not think it will be necessary," answered the lady. 

" Nor do I ; indeed, I feel sure that there will be no fur 
ther trouble, for we have placed the whole district under mili 
tary rule since the last disturbance. But I thought possibly 
you might feel timid." 

" I am not timid, Captain Newell." 

The grave captain stroked his mustache to conceal a 
smile, and then, as he rose to go, he said : " Miss Duke, I 
wish to say to you one thing. You know nothing of us, of 
course, but I trust you will accept my word when I say 
that Mr. Saxton is of good family, that he is well educated,
