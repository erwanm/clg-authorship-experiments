this scrape how hard it would be to play a role. 
There have been some dangerous breaks. Douce 
Marriot was very shrewd — you know she is ; she 
half suspected me of being an adventurer while 
she was getting over the pneumonia. Then Nan- 
nie — you remember, don't you? I left my old 
violin at Solomon's — forgot to take it away when 
we were married. One night I came across it in 
the hall closet where I hung my coats. I could 
not help it ; I took it out, and began to play — it 
was very rash. I played that old thing you used 
to like so much, — 

"Oh, promise me that you will take my hand, 
The most unworthy in this lonely land.' 

" She came in and heard me, and she stood 
stock still. ' That is Dr. Dane's violin,' she said. 
" Why do you touch it? I would rather that you 
didn't touch it. Why, you play like a dead man ! ' 
Nannie said. 



" Then there was Clyde. If he could speak Eng- 
lish he would have given me away a hundred 
times. I don't think he suspected me in the least, 
drenched in all that salt water. But when he met 
me on the street, the day I came home — you 
didn't see that. He growled at first ; you know he 
never liked me. Then he screamed, and screamed. 
I thought he would have knocked me over. After 
that, he seemed to pity me. 

" Then one night I went to town to hear Ster- 
ling Hart preach, and a fellow came in and sat 
beside me, and I saw that it was Timothy George. 
He was in the charge at San Juan, you know — 
perhaps you don't know. Well, he was, and I guess 
he never swallowed the story. He was in Clay's 
regiment. He tried to sound me that night there 
in the church. But he didn't make much head- 
way; although my opinion is, he had run across 
me and my scars in the hospital or somewhere. 
He had never seen me since my hair went to 
ashes, and it puzzled him. I told you, didn't I, 
that when I looked in the glass that day in Flor- 
ida — the day after I read the papers — I found 
it snow-white ? I don't know when it turned, any 
more than you do. Timothy told your cousin 
whatever notions he had got in his head, and 
Hart came down on me — that night in the office, 
you remember. I had to tell him everything — 

 

there wasn't any other way out of it. I never 
meant that anybody should hear it first. I meant 
to give you your rights, so far as that went. It was 
the only one I had left to give you. Is there any-
