Montague glanced at it, and saw that it was from Lucy Dupree.

“My dear Ollie,” it read. “I find myself in an embarrassing
position, owing to the fact that some business arrangements upon
which I had counted have fallen through. The money which I brought
with me to New York is nearly all gone, and, as you can understand,
my position as a stranger is a difficult one. I have a note which
Stanley Ryder gave me for my stock. It is for a hundred and forty
thousand dollars, and is due in three months. It occurred to me that
you might know someone who has some ready cash, and who would like
to purchase the note. I should be very glad to sell it for a hundred
and thirty thousand. Please do not mention it except in confidence.”

“Now, what in the world do you suppose that means?” said Oliver.

The other stared at him. “I am sure I can’t imagine,” he replied.

“How much money did Lucy have when she came here?”

“She had three or four thousand dollars. But then, she got ten
thousand from Stanley Ryder when he bought that stock.”

“She can’t have spent any such sum of money!” exclaimed Oliver.

“She may have invested it,” said the other, thoughtfully.

“Invested nothing!” exclaimed Oliver.

“But that’s not what puzzles me,” said Montague. “Why doesn’t Ryder
discount the note himself?”

“That’s just it! What business has he letting Lucy hawk his notes
about the town?”

“Maybe he doesn’t know it. Maybe she’s trying to keep her affairs
from him.”

“Nonsense!” Oliver replied. “I don’t believe anything of the sort.
What I think is that Stanley Ryder is doing it himself.”

“How do you mean?” asked Montague, in perplexity.

“I believe that he is trying to get his own note discounted. I don’t
believe that Lucy would ever come to us of herself. She’d starve
first. She’s too proud.”

“But Stanley Ryder!” protested Montague. “The president of the
Gotham Trust Company!”

“That’s all right,” said Oliver. “It’s his own note, and not the
Trust Company’s; and I’ll wager you he’s hard up for cash. There was
a big realty company that failed the other day, and I saw that Ryder
was one of the stockholders. And he’s been hit by that Mississippi
Steel slump, and I’ll wager you he’s scurrying around to raise
money. It’s just like Lucy, too. Before he gets through, he’ll take
every dollar she owns.”

Montague said nothing for a minute or two. Suddenly he clenched his
hands. “I must go up and see her,” he said.
