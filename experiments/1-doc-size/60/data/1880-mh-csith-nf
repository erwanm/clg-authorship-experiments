supper is ready, leaving about an inch of the stalks on; scrape off
the skin if you choose, but the red ones are prettier if you do not;
arrange in a tall glass or a round glass saucer, the stalks outside,
the points meeting in the centre; lay cracked ice among them and send
to table. Scrape and quarter the large white ones.

Good radishes are crisp to the teeth, look cool, and taste hot.


OKRA.

Boil the young pods, in enough salted hot water to cover them, until
tender. Drain thoroughly, and when dished pour over them a sauce of
three or four spoonfuls melted (not drawn) butter, a tablespoonful of
vinegar, pepper, and salt to taste. Heat to boiling before covering the
okras with it.


BOILED HOMINY.

The large kind, made of cracked, not ground corn, is erroneously
termed “samp” by Northern grocers. This is the Indian name for the
fine-grained. To avoid confusion, we will call the one large, the other
small. Soak the large over night in cold water. Next day put it into
a pot with at least two quarts of water to a quart of the hominy, and
boil slowly three hours, or until it is soft. Drain in a cullender,
heap in a root-dish, and stir in butter, pepper, and salt.

Soak the small hominy in the same way, and boil in as much water,
slowly, stirring very often, almost constantly at the last. It should
be as thick as mush, and is generally eaten at breakfast with sugar,
cream, and nutmeg. It is a good and exceedingly wholesome dish,
especially for children. The water in which it is boiled should be
slightly salt. If soaked in warm water, and the same be changed once or
twice for warmer, it will boil soft in an hour. Boil in the last water.


FRIED HOMINY.

If large, put a good lump of butter or dripping in the frying-pan, and
heat. Turn in some cold boiled hominy, and cook until the under-side
is browned. Place a dish upside down on the frying-pan and upset the
latter, that the brown crust may be uppermost.

Eat with meat.

Cut the small hominy in slices and fry in hot lard or drippings. Or,
moisten to a soft paste with milk; beat in some melted butter, bind
with a beaten egg, form into round cakes with your hands, dredge with
flour and fry a light brown.


HOMINY CROQUETTES. 

To a cupful of cold boiled hominy (small-grained) add a tablespoonful
melted butter and stir hard, moistening, by degrees, with a little
milk, beating to a soft light paste. Put in a teaspoonful of white
sugar, and lastly, a well-beaten egg. Roll into oval balls with floured
hands, dip in beaten egg, then cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot lard.
