daylight shorter; they were entering the Land of the Midnight 
Sun, but at the time of year when midnight noons were ap- 
proaching. The men had plenty of time for reading and talk; 
so Jimmie discussed the war from the Socialist point of view, 
defending the Kussian revolutionists ; and so, as usual, he made 
somebody angry, and got himself and his seditious opinions 
reported. 

Lieutenant Gannet was the name of Jimmie's superior offi- 
cer. He had been a clerk in a cotton-mill before the war, and 
had never had the exercise of authority. Now he had to learn 
suddenly to give orders, and his idea of doing it was to be 
extremely sharp and imperative. He was a deeply conscientious 
young man, keen on the war, and willing to face any hardship 
or peril in fulfilment of his duty; but Jimmie could not have 
been expected to appreciate that all Jimmie knew was that 
his superior had a way of glaring from behind his spectacles, as 
if he was sure that some one was lying to him. 

Lieutenant Gannet didn't ask what Jimmie had said; he 
told Jimmie what he had said, and informed him that that kind 
of talk wasn't going on in the army while he was in hearing. 
Jimmie's business was to keep some motor-cycles in repair, 
and some cyclists on their job ; about other matters let him hold 
his tongue, and not try to run the affairs of the nation. Jim-

President Wilson was saying all along. To which the lieuten- 
ant replied that he was not interested in Sergeant Higgins 
opinions of President Wilson's opinions Sergeant Higgins was 
to keep his opinions to himself, or he would get into serious 
trouble. So Jimmie went away, seething with indignation, as 
much of a rebel as he had ever been in Local Leesville. 

What were the rights of a soldier anyway? Was he privi- 
leged to discuss political issues, and to agree with the utter- 
ances of the President of his country? Might he believe, as 
the President believed, in a just peace and the right of all 
peoples to freedom and self-determination, even though many 
of the officers of the army hated and despised such ideas? 
Jimmie didn't know, and there was nobody to tell him; but 
Jimmie knew that he hadn't meant to give up his rights as a 
citizen when he enlisted to fight for democracy, and if these 
rights were taken away from him, it would not be without a 
struggle. 



The transports came into the region of ice-bergs, and low- 
hanging mists, and rocky cliffs covered with snow, and flocks 
of sea-gulls flying over them. For days and nights on end they 
steamed in those arctic waters, and came at last into the White 
Sea, and the harbour of Archangel. 

The Allies had been here since the beginning of the war, 
building docks and sheds and railway yards; but they had
