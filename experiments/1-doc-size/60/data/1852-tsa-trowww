"She is very well."

"And she has grown, I presume, finely?"

"Yes. She's now quite a stout girl."

"What kind of a child is she? Docile and obedient?"

"None could be more so. A sweeter disposition I have never seen."

"How are you getting on now, Edward?" Mr. Jasper's voice was kind and
insinuating.

"Comfortably," was answered.

"What is your salary?"

There was a momentary hesitation on the part of Claire, and then he
replied--

"Five hundred dollars."

"Is that all? I was under the impression that you received a thousand.
I am very certain that some one told me so. Too little, Edward--too
little. You are worth more than that to any one. Are you acquainted at
Edgar & Co.'s?"

"No."

"I wish you were. One of their young men is going to leave, and
they will have to fill his place immediately. The salary is twelve
hundred."

Claire's heart gave a quick bound.

"Shall I speak to Edgar for you?" added the merchant.

"If you will do so, Mr. Jasper," said Edward, with a sudden
earnestness of manner, "I shall be greatly indebted to you. I find it
a little difficult to get along on five hundred dollars a year."

"How much family have you now?"

"Three children."

"Indeed. Oh yes, you should have a higher salary. I know you would
just suit Edgar & Co., and I think the place may be secured for you."

A few moments of silence followed, and then Jasper resumed--

"But, as just said, I wish to talk with you about this ward of mine.
Your salary is so light that you, no doubt, find the income received
through her quite a help to you?"

"No--no," replied Claire; "it costs for her boarding, clothes,
schooling, etc., quite as much as we receive."

"It does?" Jasper manifested some surprise.
