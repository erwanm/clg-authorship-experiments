"You must be mistaken about your friend being a newsboy."

"He is no friend of mine."

"Your acquaintance, then; though he is nice enough looking to be a
friend. Are you sure he is a newsboy?"

"Certain. I saw him selling papers yesterday in front of the Astor
House."

"His business must be good, or he would not board at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel."

"Of whom are you speaking, Julia?" asked her father.

"Of that boy at the next table, pa."

"That boy! Why, that's my young friend of the ferry-boat. Tom, have the
kindness to ask him to come here a moment and speak to me."

Much surprised, and considerably against his will, Tom rose and walked
over to where Dan was sitting.

"Look here," said he; "come over to the next table, will you?"

"What for?" asked Dan.

"There's a gentleman wants to speak to you."

Dan looked over and he recognized Mr. Rogers, of the firm of Barton &
Rogers, who had asked him to call at his place of business on Pearl
street.

"Good-evening, Mr. Rogers," he said, politely.

"Good-evening, my boy. Do you board here?"

"Not as a rule," answered Dan, smiling. "My business don't allow it. I
am dining here with some friends."

"What's your name?"

"Daniel Mordaunt. Everybody calls me Dan."

"Then, Dan, let me make you acquainted with my daughter, Julia."

Dan bowed and smiled.

"I think you were sitting opposite me in the stage, Mr. Mordaunt," said
Julia.

"Yes, Miss Rogers."

"You were polite enough to hand me my handkerchief when I awkwardly
dropped it."

"Oh, don't mention it."

"I hope to meet you again."
