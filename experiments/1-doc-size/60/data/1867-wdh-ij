closes the ashes of Martin I.," " who was traitor- 
ously killed on the 17th of October 1277 by Scara- 
mello of the Scaramelli, w r ho wished to revenge the 
honor of a young lady of his family." " The Mau- 
soleum that is in the side facing the Place encloses 
the Martin II.'s ashes. . . . This building is sumpt- 
uous and wonderful because it stands on four col- 
umns, each of which has an architrave of nine feet. 
On the beams stands a very large square of marble 
that forms the floor, on which stands the urn of the 
Defunct. Four other columns support the vault 
that covers the urn ; and the rest is adorned by facts 
of Old Testament. Upon the Summit is the eques- 
trian statue as large as life." Of " Can Signo- 
rius," whose tomb is the most splendid of all, the 
" Notices " say : " He spent two thousand florins of 
gold, in order to prepare his own sepulchre while he 
was yet alive, and to surpass the magnificence of his 
predecessors. The monument is as magnificent as 
the contracted space allows. Six columns support 
the floor of marble on which it stands covered with 



 

figures. Six other columns support the top, on that 
is the Scaliger's statues. . . . The monument is sur- 
rounded by an enclosure of red marble, with six pil- 
lars, on which are square capitols with armed Saints. 
The rails of iron with the Arms of the Scala, are 
worked with a beauty wonderful for that age," or, I 
may add, for any age. These " rails " are an exqui- 
site net-work of iron wrought by hand, with an art 
emulous of that of Nicolo Caparra at Florence. The 
chief device employed is a ladder (scala) constantly 
repeated in the centres of quatre-foils ; and the 
whole fabric is still so flexible and perfect, after the 
lapse of centuries, that the net may be shaken 
throughout by a touch. Four other tombs of the 
Scaligeri are here, among which the " Notices " par- 
ticularly mention that of Alboin della Scala : " He 
was one of the Ghibelline party, as the arms on his urn 
schew, that is a staircase risen by an eagle where- 
fore Dante said, In sulla  Scala porta il santo 
Uccello." 

I should have been glad to meet the author of 
these delightful histories, but in his absence we 
fared well enough with the sacristan. When, a few 
hours before we left Verona, we came for a last look 
at the beautiful sepulchres, he recognized us, and see- 
ing a sketch-book in the party, he invited us within 
the inclosure again, and then ran and fetched chairs 
for us to sit upon nay, even placed chairs for us to 
rest our feet on. Winning and exuberant courtesy 
of the Italian race ! If I had never acknowledged 
it before, I must do homage to it now, remembering
