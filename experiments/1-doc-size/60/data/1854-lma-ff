Spirits with grateful love, seeking no reward but the knowledge of
their own good deeds, and the joy they always bring.  This they have
done unmurmuringly and alone; and now, far and wide, flower blessings
fall upon them, and the summer winds bear the glad tidings unto those
who droop in sorrow, and new joy and strength it brings, as they look
longingly for the friends whose gentle care hath brought such
happiness to their fair kindred.

"Are they not worthy of your love, dear Queen? Have they not won
their lovely home? Say they are pardoned, and you have gained
the love of hearts pure as the snow-white robes now folded over them."

As Bud ceased, she touched the wondering Fairies with her wand,
and the dark faded garments fell away; and beneath, the robes
of lily-leaves glittered pure and spotless in the sun-light.
Then, while happy tears fell, Queen Dew-Drop placed the bright crowns
on the bowed heads of the kneeling Fairies, and laid before them
the wands their own good deeds had rendered powerful.

They turned to thank little Bud for all her patient love,
but she was gone; and high above, in the clear air, they saw
the little form journeying back to the quiet forest.

She needed no reward but the joy she had given.  The Fairy hearts
were pure again, and her work was done; yet all Fairy-Land had learned
a lesson from gentle little Bud.


"Now, little Sunbeam, what have you to tell us?" said the Queen,
looking down on a bright-eyed Elf, who sat half hidden in the deep
moss at her feet.

"I too, like Star-Twinkle, have nothing but a song to offer,"
replied the Fairy; and then, while the nightingale's sweet voice
mingled with her own, she sang,--



CLOVER-BLOSSOM.


   IN a quiet, pleasant meadow,
     Beneath a summer sky,
   Where green old trees their branches waved,
     And winds went singing by;
   Where a little brook went rippling
     So musically low,
   And passing clouds cast shadows
     On the waving grass below;
   Where low, sweet notes of brooding birds
     Stole out on the fragrant air,
   And golden sunlight shone undimmed
     On all most fresh and fair;--
   There bloomed a lovely sisterhood
     Of happy little flowers,
   Together in this pleasant home,
     Through quiet summer hours.
   No rude hand came to gather them,
     No chilling winds to blight;
   Warm sunbeams smiled on them by day,
