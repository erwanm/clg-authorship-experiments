capricious. But she stopped him.
"Mr. Harrington, I want to speak to you," she said quickly, seeing that
her opportunity was on the point of slipping away.
"Yes?" said John, smiling faintly.
"Mr. Harrington--did you read that article about you, the day after the
skating party?"
"Yes," said John. "It was not complimentary, if I remember."
"It was vile," said Joe, the angry color rising to her temples again. "It
was abominable. It was written by Mr. Vancouver."
John started slightly.
"I think you must be mistaken," he said.
"No, I am not mistaken. There were things in it, word for word as he said
them to me just after the speech. I am perfectly sure."
John looked very gravely at Joe, as though to be sure of her honesty.
There was no mistaking the look in her eyes.
"Miss Thorn," John said, "Vancouver may have said those very things to
some one else, who wrote them and printed them. But in any case, I am
exceedingly obliged to you for the information"--
"You are not angry?" Joe began, already repenting.
"No--how could I be? It may be important. The junior senator for
Massachusetts died this morning, and there may be an election at any
moment. I have not told any one else, but it will be known everywhere in
an hour's time. Good-by, and many thanks."
"You will be senator, of course?" said Joe, in great excitement.
"I cannot tell," John answered. "Are you going down the hill?"
"No--thanks--I am going home," said Joe. "Good-by."
CHAPTER X.
Joe had been mistaken in thinking that Ronald would be less well received
than herself. There was of course the usual amount of gossip concerning
him, but as he refrained from eccentricities of dress when asked to
dinner, and did not bet that he would ride his horse into the smoking-room
of the Somerset Club, the gossip soon lost ground against the list of his
good qualities. Moreover, he was extremely good-looking, and his manner
was modesty itself. He admired everything he saw, partly because it was
new to him, and partly because there was a good deal to admire.
For a day or two after the final scene with Joe he had avoided seeing her.
He had not been able to resist the temptation to go back on the same day,
and he had spent some hours in considering that human affairs are
extremely mutable. But the scenes about him were too new, and very many of
the faces he saw were too attractive, to allow of his brooding for long
over his misfortune. His first impulse had been to go away again on the
very evening of his arrival. He had gone to see Joe, arriving during
luncheon, in the expectation of seeing her alone again. There would be a
scene of solemn farewell, in which he would bid her be happy in her own
way, in a tone of semi-paternal benevolence, after which he would give her
his blessing, and bid farewell to the pomps and vanities of society. He
would naturally retire gloomily from the gay world, and end his miserable
existence in the approved Guy Livingstone fashion of life, between
cavendish tobacco, deep drinking, and high play. Joe would then repent of
the ruin she had caused, and that would be a great satisfaction. There was
once a little boy in Boston whose hands were very cold as he went to
school. But he blew on them savagely, saying, "I am glad of it! It serves
my father right for not buying me my gloves." That was Ronald's state of
mind. He had led the most sober of lives, and the wildest dissipation he
remembered was the Lord Mayor's supper to the Oxford and Cambridge crews,
when he himself had been one of the winners. But surely, for a
disappointed lover there could be no course so proper as a speedy death by
dissipation--which would serve Joe right. Therefore, on his return to his
hotel, he ordered whiskey, in a sepulchral tone of voice. He tasted it,
and thought it detestable.
