"Oh, don’t!  Please don’t!  I’m too weak.  I’ll go to bed—really I will,
Michael.  And leave you to wrap yourself in your nightie and stalk back
to the Admiral——"

"Damn it all!" I broke out.  She rocked, helplessly, her face buried in
her hands.

After a while she got up, supporting herself by one hand on the
stair-rail.  The other hand pressed her heart.

"Michael dear," she said, "you are perfectly right.  We are what we are.
Nothing alters that. We are born what we are; we die what we are.  No
cataclysm can change what we really are....  As for distinction of rank,
don’t you know, Michael, that social inequality always has existed and
always will?"

"Not artificial social inequality.  Minds alone will dominate.
Personality only will count. Inheritance and tradition will play no part
in the world’s future after this war ends."

"You seem to be quite sure, Michael."

"Perfectly."

"But you are so young to be a prophet and a seer!"

"Good heavens, Thusis, is there nothing serious in you!" I exclaimed
wrathfully.

"Not just at the moment," she retorted, controlling her laughter.  "And
I’d better go to bed or I’ll be suggesting that we start that music-box
down stairs and try a two-step."

I took a step toward her: "It amuses you to be funny," said I, "but
before we take leave of each other suppose you hand me that pistol."

"Indeed I shall not!"

"If you don’t hand it over," said I, "I shall be obliged to catch you
and take it away from you."  And I started toward her.

At that she flew up the stairs, turned on the landing and leaned down
toward me with an adorable gesture.

"Go to the devil!" she whispered softly.  And vanished in the dusk
above.

                               *ROYALTY*


The Queen demanded her breakfast in bed. Clelia came to the breakfast
room to tell me so.

I had heard the furious ringing of her bell and I said to Smith that
something of that sort was likely to happen.
