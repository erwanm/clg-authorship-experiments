First, My child-wife, or the experiences of childhood.

Second, My shadow-wife, or the dreamland of the future.

Third, my real wife, where I saw her, how I sought and found her.

In pursuing a story simply and mainly of love and marriage, I am
reminded of the saying of a respectable serving man of European
experiences, who speaking of his position in a noble family said it was
not so much the wages that made it an object as "the things it enabled
a gentleman to pick up." So in our modern days as we have been
observing, it is not so much the story, as the things it gives the
author a chance to say. The history of a young American man's progress
toward matrimony, of course brings him among the most stirring and
exciting topics of the day, where all that relates to the joint
interests of man and woman has been thrown into the arena as an open
question, and in relating our own experiences, we shall take occasion to
keep up with the spirit of this discussing age in all these matters.

"The big boys quizzed me, made hideous faces at me from behind their

The Bible says it is not good for man to be alone. This is a truth that
has been borne in on my mind, with peculiar force, from the earliest of
my recollection. In fact when I was only seven years old I had selected
my wife, and asked the paternal consent.

You see, I was an unusually lonesome little fellow, because I belonged
to the number of those unlucky waifs who come into this mortal life
under circumstances when nobody wants or expects them. My father was a
poor country minister in the mountains of New Hampshire with a salary of
six hundred dollars, with nine children. I was the tenth. I was not
expected; my immediate predecessor was five years of age, and the
gossips of the neighborhood had already presented congratulations to my
mother on having "done up her work in the forenoon," and being ready to
sit down to afternoon leisure.

Her well-worn baby clothes were all given away, the cradle was peaceably
consigned to the garret, and my mother was now regarded as without
excuse if she did not preside at the weekly prayer-meeting, the monthly
Maternal Association, and the Missionary meeting, and perform besides
regular pastoral visitations among the good wives of her parish.

No one, of course, ever thought of voting her any little extra salary on
account of these public duties which absorbed so much time and attention
from her perplexing domestic cares--rendered still more severe and
onerous by my father's limited salary. My father's six hundred dollars,
however, was considered by the farmers of the vicinity as being a
