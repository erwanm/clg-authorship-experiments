"This would be wet at all times. I think the 
ground must have sunk, Dolly; people would 
never have built in the water so. The ground 
must have sunk." 

"No, mother; I guess not. It has been always 
just so." 

" What made them build here then, when there 



 

is all the earth beside? What did they take to 
the water for ? And what are the houses standing 
on, anyway ? " 

" Islands, mother, between which these canals 
run. I told you before." 

"I should think the people hadn't any sense." 

And nothing would tempt Mrs. Copley out that 
day. Of course Dolly must stay at home too, 
though she would most gladly have gone about 
through the rainy, silent city in one of those silent 
gondolas, and fed her eyes at every step. However, she made herself and made her mother as 
comfortable as she could; got out her painting 
and worked at Rupert's portrait, which was so successful that Lawrence begged she would begin 
upon him at once. 

" You know the conditions " she said. 

"I accept them. Finish one of me so good as 
that, and I will send it to my mother and ask her 
what she will give for it." 

" But not tell her ? " 

" Certainly not." 

" I find," said Dolly slowly, " that it is a very 
great compliment for a lady to paint a gentleman's 
likeness." 

"Why?" 

" She has to give so much attention to the lines 
of his face ! I shouldn't like to paint some people. 
But I'll do anybody, for a consideration." 

" Your words are not flattering," said Lawrence, 
"even if your actions are."
