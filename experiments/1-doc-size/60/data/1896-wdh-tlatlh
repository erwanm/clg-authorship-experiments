" People change. " 

"Do I?" 

" Not for the better." 

Jeff was dumb. She was pleased with her* hit, and 
laughed. But her laugh did not encourage him to put 
his arm round her again. He let the mare walk on, 
and left her to resume the conversation at whatever 
point she would. 

She made no haste to resume it. At last she said, 
with sufficient apparent remoteness from the subject 
they had dropped, " Jeff, I don't know whether you 
want me to talk about it. But I guess I ought to, even 
if it isn't my place exactly. I don't think Jackson's 
very well, this summer." 

Jeff faced round towards her. " What makes you 
think he isn't well ? " 

" He's weaker. Haven't you noticed it ? " 

" Yes, I have noticed that. He's worked down ; 
that's all." 

" No, that isn't all. But if you don't think so — " 

" I want to know what you think, Cynthy," said 

Jeff, with the amorous resentment all gone from his 



 

voice. " Sometimes folks outside notice the signs 
more — I don't mean that you're an outsider, as far 
as we're concerned — " 

She put by that point. " Father's noticed it, too ; 
and he's with Jackson a good deal." 

" I'll look after it. If he isn't so well, he's got to 
have a doctor. That medium's stufE can't do him any 
good. Don't you think he ought to have a doctor ? " 
" Oh, yes." 

" You don't think a doctor can do him much good ? " 
" He ought to have one," said the girl, non-commit- 
tally. 

" Cynthia, I've noticed that Jackson was weak, too ; 
and it's no use pretending that he's simply worked 
down. I believe he's worn out. Do you think moth- 
er's ever noticed it ? " 

" I don't believe she has."
