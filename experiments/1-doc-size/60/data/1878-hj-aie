" But you are a member of Parliament," said 
the young girl. 

" I don 't like the sound of that, either." 

" Don 't you sit in the House of Lords ?" Bessie 
Alden went on. 

" Very seldom," said Lord Lambeth. 

" Is it an important position ?" she asked. 


" Oh dear no," said Lord Lambeth. 

" I should think it would be very grand," said 
Bessie Alden, " to possess, simply by an accident

" It would be awfully kind of you to come 
and stay there," said Lord Lambeth. He took a 
vague satisfaction in the circumstance that Percy 
Beaumont had not heard him make the remark I 
have just recorded. 

Mr. Westgate all this time had not, as they 
said at Newport, "come on." His wife more 
than once announced that she expected him on 
the morrow ; but on the morrow she wandered
