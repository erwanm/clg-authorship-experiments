which the English themselves spoke of as 
"abroad" ? Ah he was in all conscience already 
abroad enough ! 

It was on the morning of this tenth day that 
he definitely promised his friends in the City the 
expression on the morrow of his final view of 
Mrs. Midmore. He had hung the night before, 
again postponing re-entrance, in front of the 
habitation contingently reserved for her, and 
he had now returned westward with a certain 
gathered and penitent sharpness on the subject 
of action. Action would be to drive straight to 
Mansfield Square, indulge himself with another 
impression, let this impression settle the case 
and then wire to the City the result of it. It 
so befell none the less that he repaired again 
and as if mechanically and in the beguiling in 
tensity of this conclusion to his lodgings, where, 
instead of taking, after a glance at some letters 
that had come in, a prompt fresh start, he dropped 
into a chair and drew it a foot or two nearer the 
fire that a particularly English April seemed 
huskily to have prescribed. The day was dark 
and damp, and it had suddenly occurred to him 
that not once yet, since the hour, at home, of his

writing. That was as far as he had got with the 
book, of which the plan still remained sketchy; 
he prefigured it mainly as a volume that should , 
"courit A1 = 3 which meant for him to be noticed by 
the half-dozen persons who themselves counted 
and who would more or less understand. He 
had already, and even repeatedly, asked himself 
when he should be able so to detach himself as 
to think at all straight about his book; detach 
ment and selection, prime aids of the artist, were 
the sacred sparenesses menaced by a rank growth 
of material. It was perhaps the better to think 
that he now put back his head and closed his 
eyes; he at any rate considered to such purpose 
that he never moved for two hours. The first 
conception his mind had registered was that he 
was brutally tired. When he woke the day was 
darker, and on shaking himself for a look from 
his window he was met by a state of rain. Wet,
