people the worldly, semi-smart ones, not the frumpy, sickly 
lot who wore dirty drapery ; and the aesthetic people had run 
after her. Basil Dashwood instructed Sherringham sketchily 
as to the different sects in the great religion of beauty, and 





was able to give him the particular " note " of the critical 
clique to which Miriam had begun so quickly to owe it that 
she had a vogue. The information made the secretary of 
embassy feel very ignorant of the world, very uninitiated and 
buried in his little professional hole. Dashwood warned him 
that it would be a long time before the general public would 
wake up to Miss Booth, even after she had waked up to 
herself : she would have to do some really big thing first. 
They knew it was in her, the big thing Sherringham and he, 
and even poor Nash because they had seen her as no one 
else had ; but London never took any one on trust it had to 
be cash down. It would take their young lady two or three 
years to pay out her cash and get her equivalent. But of 
course the equivalent would be simply a gold-mine. Within 
its limits however, her success was already quite a fairy-tale : 
there was magic in the way she had concealed, from the 
first, her want of experience. She absolutely made you think 
she had a lot of it, more than any one else. Mr. Dashwood 
repeated several times that she was a cool hand a deucedly 
cool hand ; and that he watched her himself, saw ideas come 
to her, saw her try different dodges on different nights. She 
was always alive she liked it herself. She gave him ideas, 
long as he had been on the stage. Naturally she had a great 
deal to learn a tremendous lot to learn : a cosmopolite like 
Sherringham would understand that a girl of that age, who 
had never had a friend but her mother her mother was 
greater fun than ever now naturally ivould have. Sherring- 
ham winced at being called a " cosmopolite " by his young 
companion, just as he had winced a moment before at hearing 
himself lumped, in esoteric knowledge, with Dashwood and 
Gabriel Nash; but the former of these gentlemen took no 
account of his sensibility while he enumerated a few of the 
things that the young actress had to learn. Dashwood was 
a mixture of acuteness and innocent fatuity ; and Sherringham 
had to recognize that he had some of the elements of criticism 
in him when he said that the wonderful thing in the girl was 
that she learned so fast learned something every night, 
learned from the same old piece a lot more than any one else 
would have learned from twenty. " That's what it is to be 
a genius," Sherringham remarked. " Genius is only the art 
of getting your experience fast, of stealing it, as it were ; and 
in this sense Miss Booth's a regular brigand." Dashwood 
assented good-humouredly ; then he added, " Oh, she'll do ! " 
It was exactly in these simple words, in speaking to her, that 





Sherringham had phrased the same truth; yet he didn't 
enjoy hearing them on his neighbour's lips : they had a pro-
