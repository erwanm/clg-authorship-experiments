" That just suits me," he said, good-humoredly. " I 
want to go over to the village." 

Ada put on her hat and stepped into the basket 
phaeton as if it was all her very own, and threw a 
rose-colored shawl over her light dress for effect,

" You ought to be a little careful, Miss Kathie, and 
not spread your hands now while you are growing. 
Little girls' hands are tender." 

Kathie laughed. " Mamma's hands are pretty, and
