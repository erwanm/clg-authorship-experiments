He has a scholar meditating under him — Mina Bahadur 
Rana — but we did not see him. He wears clothes and is 
very imperfect. He has written a little pamphlet about his 
master, and I have that. It contains a wood-cut of the master 
and himself seated on a rug in the garden. The portrait of 
the master is very good indeed. The posture is exactly that 
which Brahma himself affects, and it requires long arms and 
limber legs, and can be accumulated only by gods and the india 
rubber man. There is a life-size marble relief of Shri 108, S.B.S, 
in the garden. It represents him in this same posture. 
Dear me ! It is a strange 
world. Particularly the Indian 
division of it. This pupil, Mina 
Bahadur Eana, is not a com- 
monplace person, but a man 
of distinguished capacities and 
attainments, and, apparently, 
he had a fine worldly career in 
front of him.

the Nepal Government in a 
high capacity at the Court of 
the Yiceroy of India, twenty 
years ago. He was an able 
man, educated, a thinker, a man 
of property. But tJae longing 
to devote himself to a religious life came upon him, and he 
resigned his place, turned his back upon the vanities and com- 
forts of the world, and went away into the solitudes to live in 
a hut and study the sacred writings and meditate upon virtue 
and holiness and seek to attain them. This sort of religion 
resembles ours. Christ recommended the rich to give away 
all their property and follow. Him in poverty, not in worldly 
comfort. American and English millionaires do it every 
day, and thus verify and confirm to the world the tremend- 
ous forces that lie in religion. Yet many people scoff at 
them for this loyalty to duty, and many will scoff at Mina 
Bahadur Rana and call him a crank. Like many Christians 
of great character and intellect, he has made the study 
of his Scriptures and the writing of books of commentaries 
upon them the loving lai)or of his life. Like them, he has 
believed that his was not an idle and foolish waste of his life, 
but a most worthy and honorable employment of it. Yet, 
there are many people who will see in those others, men 
worthy of homage and deep reverence, but in hfm merely a 
crank. But I shall not. He has my reverence. And I don't 
offer it as a common thing and poor, but as an unusual thing 
and of value. The ordinary reverence, the reverence defined 
and explained by the dictionary costs nothing. Reverence 
for one's own sacred things — parents, religion, flag, laws, and 
respect for one's own beliefs — these are feelings which we 
cannot even help. They come natural to us ; they are invol- 
untary, like breathing. There is no personal merit in breath- 
ing. But the reverence which is difficult, and which has per- 
sonal merit in it, is the respect which you pay, without com- 
pulsion, to the political or religious attitude of a man whose 
beliefs are not yours. You can't revere his gods or his politics,
