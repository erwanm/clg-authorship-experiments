point: have the schools, and the dates and the jargon pat, and yet
wouldn’t know a Phidias if it stood where they hadn’t expected it.”

He had all my sympathy, poor Neave; yet these were trials inseparable
from the collector’s lot, and not always without their secret
compensations. Certainly they did not wholly explain my friend’s
attitude; and for a moment I wondered if it were due to some strange
disillusionment as to the quality of his treasures. But no! the Daunt
collection was almost above criticism; and as we passed from one object
to another I saw there was no mistaking the genuineness of Neave’s pride
in his possessions. The ripe sphere of beauty was his, and he had found
no flaw in it as yet...

A year later came the amazing announcement--the Daunt collection was for
sale. At first we all supposed it was a case of weeding out (though how
old Daunt would have raged at the thought of anybody’s weeding his
collection!) But no--the catalogue corrected that idea. Every stick and
stone was to go under the hammer. The news ran like wildfire from Rome
to Berlin, from Paris to London and New York. Was Neave ruined, then?
Wrong again--the dealers nosed that out in no time. He was simply
selling because he chose to sell; and in due time the things came up at
Christie’s.

But you may be sure the trade had found an answer to the riddle; and
the answer was that, on close inspection, Neave had found the collection
less impeccable than he had supposed. It was a preposterous answer--but
then there was no other. Neave, by this time, was pretty generally
recognized as having the subtlest flair of any collector in Europe,
and if he didn’t choose to keep the Daunt collection it could be only
because he had reason to think he could do better.

In a flash this report had gone the rounds and the buyers were on their
guard. I had run over to London to see the thing through, and it was the
queerest sale I ever was at. Some of the things held their own, but a
lot--and a few of the best among them--went for half their value. You
see, they’d been locked up in old Daunt’s house for nearly twenty years,
and hardly shown to any one, so that the whole younger generation of
dealers and collectors knew of them only by hearsay. Then you know
the effect of suggestion in such cases. The undefinable sense we were
speaking of is a ticklish instrument, easily thrown out of gear by
a sudden fall of temperature; and the sharpest experts grow shy and
self-distrustful when the cold current of depreciation touches them. The
sale was a slaughter--and when I saw the Daunt Diana fall at the wink of
a little third-rate brocanteur from Vienna I turned sick at the folly
of my kind.

For my part, I had never believed that Neave had sold the collection
because he’d “found it out”; and within a year my incredulity was
justified. As soon as the things were put in circulation they were known
for the marvels they are. There was hardly a poor bit in the lot; and
my wonder grew at Neave’s madness. All over Europe, dealers began to be
fighting for the spoils; and all kinds of stuff were palmed off on the
unsuspecting as fragments of the Daunt collection!

Meanwhile, what was Neave doing? For a long time I didn’t hear, and
chance kept me from returning to Rome. But one day, in Paris, I ran
across a dealer who had captured for a song one of the best Florentine
bronzes in the Daunt collection--a marvellous plaquette of
Donatello’s. I asked him what had become of it, and he said with a grin:
“I sold it the other day,” naming a price that staggered me.
