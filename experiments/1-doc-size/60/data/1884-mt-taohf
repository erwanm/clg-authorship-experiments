"Oh, I  can't  make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. I'll
walk--I don't mind the distance."

"But we won't  let  you walk--it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to
do it. Come right in."

"Oh,  do,"' says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a
bit in the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and we
can't let you walk. And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on
another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us.
Come right in and make yourself at home."

So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger
