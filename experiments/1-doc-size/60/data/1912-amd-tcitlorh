eager decision. 

“ You’re the girl for me,” giving her hand a

Mr. Firth’s grandfather was killed in a great 
battle of Tippecanoe in the Indian war when Gen- 
eral Harrison gained such a victory. Then his 
father voted for the General when he was elected 
President. And husband used to sing an old bit 
of song — 

“ ‘ Tippecanoe and Tyler, too, 

Are bound to rule the country through,’ ” 

and he was named Harrison, but his father began

was all set on flowers and trees, and we used to 
plan that sometime we’d go away from Denby, only 
here was the house, and we couldn’t seem to get 
ahead. He did a good deal of work over in 
Grafton. You know farmer-folk are not much 
for anything besides hay, corn, and potatoes,” 
with a vague little smile. “ We had some fine 
fruit trees — maybe you would like to see them?”
