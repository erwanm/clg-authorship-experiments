an interest in unfortunate children. You ought to 
love him a great deal.” 

Oh, I do. We all do,” he returned, with deep 
feeling. 

He kept thinking of it at night. He was not 
a bit sleepy. How Would it be to have just such 
a father! He didn’t want one like Arthur’s, who 
could go ’way off and leave his little boy to die 
alone, but to live in that big house and leave the 
beautiful out of doors and the dogs and some one 
to take you around and give you clothes and ever 
so many things you wanted! Why, it would be 
like — like — well, there was nothing to compare it 
with except the fairy stories, and they were not 
true, more was the pity. And it was like a fairy 
story, too, that about the picnic and his coming 
here, and he wondered why Mr. Mann’s wife had 
not had a houseful of children when he liked 
them so. 


 

And in the midst of this Chan fell asleep with- 
out ever counting the days that must elapse before 
he could go home. There was a sweet smile on his 
face as if joy and gladness were following him in 
the enchanted land of slumber. 


CHAPTER XIII 


WAS IT A CROWN OR A CROSS? 

Marigold and Primrose Firth stood still and 
stared as they entered the room where the con- 
valescents were playing and resting. Chan was 
building a high church with a steeple and had his 
back to the door and his eyes on the little boy who 
was so eager he kept fidgeting about. Then he 
heard a voice. 

“ Oh, Goldie ! Oh, Prim ! ” And he almost 
toppled over in his eagerness. The church did 
quite. 

“ Never mind, Eddy. Til build it all over. 
They’re my sisters, and I haven’t seen them in ever 
so long.” 

Oh, Chan ! And you don’t limp a bit ! ” Mari- 
gold’s eyes were so full of joy that they over- 
flowed with tears. 

They made a picture hugging each other, and 
Miss Jessie wished she had her camera* handy to 
take a snapshot.
