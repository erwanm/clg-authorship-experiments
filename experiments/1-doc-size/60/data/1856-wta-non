" I do not know. We returned from Maine only 
yesterday ; but Squire Lee will satisfy her. All that 
can worry her, as it has worried me, will be her fears 

 

for your safety when she hears of your escape."

hour of his great triumph, he realized that, if he had 
been faithless to the light within him, his laurel would 
have been a crown of thorns. 

He was happy very happy. What made him

Mr. Bayard; not the handsome salary he was to re-
