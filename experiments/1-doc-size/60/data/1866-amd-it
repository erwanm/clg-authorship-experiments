" God knows, Dick, if I could have taken myself out of 
the way before this came out, I would gladly have given 
every dollar I possess. I meant to have spared you this 
trouble ; but it's my luck. Nothing ever does go right with 
me ! " and Robert absolutely sobbed. 

" ' The way of the transgressor is hard.' O, how could 
you have fallen into such a sin ? " 

" I didn't think how it would end. And you know, Dick, 
hundreds of young men do the same thing." 

Richard could have spurned his brother for this weak jus- 
tification. 

" What is to be done ? " he asked, coldly. 

" Buy them off, I suppose, for I'm sick of the girl, and 
can't marry her. I don't think I would have gone so far if 
it hadn't been for George Townley. He planned it all, and 
personated the clergyman. O, I could kill myself for being

I believe I was infatuated, Dick ; and then the old woman 
was so pressing ! Townley said it would be a good joke, and 
the girl wouldn't care a bit when she grew tired of me." 

Richard half suppressed a groan of anguish. 

" They were as much to blame as I," Robert said, quickly, 
u for the old woman fairly inveigled me into it. And I dare 
say the girl will play the same game over twenty times." 



 

" Is she like her mother ? " 

" Not a bit. I believe she isn't really her child. She's a 
pretty little milk-and-water thing ; her face bewitched me at 
first ; but I'm sick and tired of her now." 

In spite of his hardihood, Robert's face was crimson with 
shame. He understood Richard too well to attempt any
