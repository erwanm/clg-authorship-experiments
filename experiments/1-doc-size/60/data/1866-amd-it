" Well," she said, " seeing you don't mind the disgrace " 

"I'll tell you what I will do," interrupted Robert; "I 



 

have twelve hundred dollars still left of my share of the 
estate. She may take that, or I'll marry her to-morrow 
morning, and go to California to-morrow afternoon. There 
is no law to keep me Aere, if I provide for my wife s before I 
go ; " and a smile of triumph lit the haughty face. 

" Twelve hundred dollars won't take care of her and a

it is best for me to go away." 





" Yes ; " and Richard sighed wearily, adding, " Go now ; 
if you still desire to take the children out, I have no objec- 
tion to make. It may be the last time. And your secret is
