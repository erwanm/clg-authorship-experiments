what I thought," she faltered. 

" I was going to run away, for I shouldn 't like to 
mix myself up in your affair it 's certainly a very 
strange one unless I was sure I could help you. But 
if you think I can " 

Clementina shook her head. " I don 't believe you 
can," she said, with a candor so wistful that Miss Mil- 
ray stopped quite short. " How does Mr. Gregory 
take this Belsky business ? " she asked. 

" I guess he feels it moa than I do," said the girl. 

" He shows his feeling more ? " 

" Yes no He believes he drove him to it." 

Miss Milray took her hand, for parting, but did not 
kiss her. " I won 't advise you, my dear. In fact, 
you haven 't asked me to. You 'll know what to do, if 
you haven 't done it already ; girls usually have, when 




they want advice. Was there something you were 
going to say ? " 

" Oh, no. Nothing. Do you think," she hesitated, 
appealingly, "do you think we are engaged ?" 

"If he 's anything of a man at all, he must think 
he is." 

"Yes," said Clementina, wistfully, "I guess he 
does." 

Miss Milray looked sharply at her. " And docs 
he think you are ? " 

" I don 't know he didn 't say." 

" Well," said Miss Milray, rather dryly, " then it 's 
something for you to think over pretty carefully."

HIXKLE came back in the afternoon to make a hope 
ful report of his failure to learn anything more of 
Belsky, but Gregory did not come with him. He 
came the next morning long before Clementina ex 
pected visitors, and he was walking nervously up and 
down the room when she appeared. As if he could 
not speak, he held toward her without speaking a tel 
egram in English, dated that day in Rome : 

" Deny report of my death. Have written.
