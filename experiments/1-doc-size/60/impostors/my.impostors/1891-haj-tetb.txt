"To be sure!"

"Now with what you picked up you can live a year or two in comfort.
Upon my soul, I envy you. Are you suspected?"

"I have managed to divert suspicion, I think;" and Palmer told his
friend the story of his secreting the gold watch and chain in Fred's
luggage.

"Very shrewd!" said his friend approvingly. "Palmer, you are a credit
to our profession. I shall be content to take lessons of you."

"Oh, you are only joking," said Palmer, his expression showing,
however, that he felt proud of the compliment.

They took a long and leisurely walk together, talking over their mutual
experiences. They had known each other for ten years, having been
fellow boarders together as far back as that at Sing Sing, since then
neither had been caught, though both had been engaged in violating the
laws. Their similar professions had given them a common bond of
sympathy, and they found so much satisfaction in each other's company
that the time slipped by insensibly, and it was half-past twelve before
they found their way back to the Clifton.

Mr. Palmer stepped up to the desk.

"Have you a room for me yet?" he inquired.

"Yes, sir; I can give you No. 67. Here, front!"

A hall boy answered the summons.

"Take the gentleman up to 67," said the clerk.

"Any luggage, sir?"

"You may hand me my valise, if you please."

"Beg pardon; here it is."

"Come up with me, Wellington. We'll continue our talk up stairs."

Palmer merely glanced at the valise, and continued talking with his
friend. The hall boy unlocked the door of No. 67 and led the way
inside.

It was a pleasant room, and Palmer looked about him approvingly.

"I shall be very comfortable here," he said.

"Is everything right?" asked the hall boy, lingering.

Palmer smiled, drew a quarter from his pocket and put it into the ready
hand of the young man.

"You take American coins, don't you?" he asked with a smile.

"Oh, dear, yes, sir. Thank you!"
