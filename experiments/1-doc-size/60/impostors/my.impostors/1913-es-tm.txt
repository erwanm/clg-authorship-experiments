believe me. But would I urge you if that malignity were true? Would I?”

“Gulian, no, you would not.”

“There! You see! You have to believe me.”

“It is not that.”

“It is the divorce then! But you are no more married to that dismal
cad than I am to one of your maids. Except in Nevada the decree has no
effect whatever. But without bothering to have it set aside, come with
me and let this saurian get another.”

“Gulian, yes, but for the moment surely you can see that this is
impossible.”

“Impossible! There is nothing impossible. Why do you say so? Why do
you make so many objections? You should not make any. You hear a
cock-and-bull story, take it for gospel, run away, get a divorce, marry
a damned scoundrel and, when you find the story is a brutal lie, stick
like a leech to him.”

“Gulian, if you but knew. My position is horrible----”

She wanted to tell him that she was in a prison replete with tortures,
one from which she was as eager to go as he was to take her, yet one
from which she could not escape through the open door of sinning.

He gave her no time. Instantly he interrupted her.

“I know your position, it is all of your own making, too. By God, you
can make up your mind to one thing. You’ll come, if I have to take you.”

As he spoke he looked so brutal that she shrank.

“Gulian, you will kill me. I thought so before. I know it now.”

“It is only what you deserve.”

“Gulian! And you said you loved me!”

“Yes, but you make me doubt it.”

The wrap which previously she had loosened she let fall on a chair
beside her and put the fichu on the table.

“Gulian, you must give me time.”

The words were simple, plaintively uttered, but her action with the
cloak and lace, gave them an emphasis which added to his irritation.

“Nonsense,” he retorted. “You have had time enough. Now you must act.”
Roughly he considered her. “Anyone else might think you cared for
that----”

“Gulian, in all the world you know I love but you.”

Verplank raised the cloak, reached for the fichu.

“Put these on, then, and come.”
