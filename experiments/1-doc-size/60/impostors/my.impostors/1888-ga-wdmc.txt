that negative quality called personal magnetism, 
while wiser and better men pass by unnoticed ? 
One naturally asks. What is love ? A spiritual 
enthusiasm which a cold-blooded analyst would 
call sentimentality, or its correlative, a fever of 
the senses ? Neither is a very exalted set of 
conditions. I have been through both more than 
once, and if my attacks have been light, I 
have been the better enabled to study my fair 
inspiration. I never discovered that she felt 
more deeply; simply more strongly, more
tempestuously, after the nature of women. Her 
feelings were not more complex, they were 
merely more strongly accentuated. A woman in 
love imagines that she is the pivot on which the 
world revolves. A general may immortalize himself,
an emperor be assassinated and his empire 
plunged into a French Revolution, and her pass- 
ing interest is not roused; nor is she unapt to 
wonder how others can be interested in matters 
so purely impersonal. She thinks she loves as 
no woman ever loved before, and sometimes she 
succeeds in making the man think so too. But 
when a man has gone through this sort of thing 
a couple of dozen times, he becomes impressed 



 

with the monotony, the shallowness, and the 
racial resemblance, so to speak, of the divine pas- 
sion; and his own capacity for indulging in it 
diminishes in proportion. If Miss Penrhyn is 
capable of anything wider and deeper and higher 
than her 'average sister, I have met her too late 
to be inspired with anything beyond passing
curiosity. In fact, I doubt if I could be capable of 
so much as indulging in the surmise had I never 
known my grandmother. There was a woman 
unique in her generation. So strong was her 
individuality that I was forced to appreciate it, 
even in the days when I used to make her life a 
burden by planting her silver spoons in the rose- 
garden and re-setting her favorite cuttings wrong 
side up. I wish she had lived longer; it would 
have been both a pleasure and a profit to have 
studied and analyzed her. And how I should 
like to know her history ! That she had one 
there is no doubt. The lines of repression in her 
face were the strongest I have ever seen, to say 
nothing of the night I found her standing over 
the Byzantine chest with her hands full of yellow 
papers. There were no lines of repression in 
her face just then; she looked fairly murderous. 
She did not see me, and I left with a brevity 
worthy of its cause. I should like to know who 
wrote those letters. I looked for them after her 
death, but she had either destroyed them or else 
that old Byzantine chest has a secret drawer. If
