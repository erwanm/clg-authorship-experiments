had finished, he flung out his arms upon the desk, 
buried his head in them, and burst into tears. 
The tears were the result, not so much of 
extreme nervous tension, as of the wonder and awe 
and ecstacy with which his own genius had filled 
him. In a few moments his emotion had 
subsided and was succeeded by a state less purely 
spiritual. He stood up, and leaning one hand 
on the desk, looked down at the poem, his soul 
filled with an exultant sense of power. Power 
was what he had gloried in all his life. His birth 
 

had given it to him socially, his money had lent 
its aid, and his personal fascination had com- 
pleted the chapter. But he had wanted some- 
thing more than the commonplace power which 
fate or fortune grants to many. He had wanted 
that power which lifts a man high above his 
fellow-men, condemning him to solitude, 
perhaps, but, in that fiercely beating light, revealing 
him to all men's gaze. If life had drifted by 
him, it had been because he was too much of a 
philosopher to attempt the impossible, too clever 
to publish his incompetence to the world. 

His inactivity had not been the result of lack 
of ambition, and yet, as he stood there gazing 
down upon his work, it seemed to him that he 
had never felt the stirrings of that passion 
before. With the power to gratify his ambition, 
ambition sprang from glowing coals into a 
mighty flame which roared and swept about him, 
darted into every corner and crevice of his 
being, pulsated through his mind and spirit, and 
temporarily drove out every other instinct and 
desire. He threw back his head, his eyes flash- 
ing and his lips quivering. For the moment he 
looked inspired, as he registered a vow to have 
his name known in every corner of the civilized 
world. That he had so far been unable to 
accomcomplish anything in his present 
embodiment gave him no uneasiness at the 
moment. Sooner or later the imprisoned song 


would force its way through the solid masonry 
in which it was walled up â€” He gave a short laugh 
and came down to earth; his fancy was running 
away with him. 

He folded the poem compactly and put it in his 
breast pocket, determined that it should never 
leave him again until a copy was in the hands of the 
printer. It should be sent forth from Constan- 
tinople. The poem must be the apparent off- 
spring of his present incarnation; and as he had 
never been in Constantinople he must go there 
and remain for several months before publica- 
tion.
