Then too, in the palace of Riad, there are stored great quantities of
precious weapons, most of them made in Syria, with many swords of Sham,
which you say are the best, though I do not understand the matter, each
having an inscription in letters of gold upon the blade, and the hilt
most cunningly chiselled in the same metal, or carved out of ivory.'

'I saw the treasure of Haïl when we took it away after the war, and most
of it was distributed among us, but there was nothing like this,' said
Abdullah.

'The treasure of Haïl is to the treasure of Riad, as a small black fly
walking upon the face of the sun,' answered Almasta. 'And yet there was
wealth there also, and there was much which you never saw. For that
Khaled, who is now Sultan, is crafty and avaricious, and he loaded many
camels secretly by night, being helped by black slaves, all of whom he
slew afterwards with his own hand lest they should tell the tale, and he
then called camel-drivers and sent them away with the beasts to Riad.
And he said to them: "These are certain loads of fine wheat and of
mellow dates, for the Sultan's table, such as cannot be found in Riad."
But he sent a letter to his father-in-law, who caused all the packs to
be taken immediately to one of the secret chambers, where he and his
daughter Zehowah took out the jewels and stored them with their own. And
as for me, I believe that Khaled made an end of the Sultan himself by
means of poison in Dereyiyah, for he rode away suddenly after they had
met, as though his conscience smote him.'

'What is this evil tale which you are telling me?' cried Abdullah.
'Surely, it is a lie, for Khaled is a brave man who gives every one his
due and deceives no one. And he is by no means subtle, for I have heard
him in council, and he generally said only, "Smite," but sometimes he
said "Strike," and that was all his eloquence. But whether he said the
one or the other, he was generally the first to follow his own advice
which, indeed, by the merciful dispensation of Allah, procured us the
victory. But what is this tale which you have invented?'

'And who is this Khaled whom you praise?' asked Almasta. 'And how can
you know his craftiness as I know it, who have lived in the palace and
braided his wife's hair, and brought him drink when he was thirsty? Is
he a man of your tribe whose descent you can count upon your fingers,
from him to his grandfather and to Ishmael and Abraham? Or is he a man
of a tribe known to you, and whose generations you also know? Has any
man called him Khaled ibn Mohammed, or Khaled ibn Abdullah? Or has he
ever spoken of his father, who is probably now drinking boiling water,
and the black angels are pounding his head with iron maces. Yet he says
that he came from the desert. Then you, who are of the desert, do not
know the desert, for you do not know whence he is. But there are those
who do know, and he fears them, lest they should tell the truth and
destroy him.'

'These are idle tales,' said Abdullah. 'Is it probable that the Sultan
would have bestowed his daughter and all the treasures you have
described upon such a man without having made inquiries concerning his
family? And if the Sultan said nothing to us about it, and if Khaled
holds his peace, they have doubtless their reasons. For it may be that
there is a blood feud between the people of Khaled and some great person
in Riad, so that he would be in danger of his life if he revealed his
father's name. Allah knows. It is not our business.'

'O Abdullah, you are simple, and you believe all things!' cried Almasta.
'But I heard of him in Basrah.'
