Solferino ran on. Presently everybody 
seemed to be talking at once. Momentarily 
Maud's too alluring looks were forgotten. 
But when the dinner was over, several men 



 

gathered in the hall about her and there remained until drawn into the fumoir, where 
Welden was the last to follow and where, 
afterward, with the hopelessness of a regret 
that is to be eternal, he wished he had never 
gone. 

There, a footman was trundling a chest 
on wheels. In it were cigars of different 
shades and sizes, cigarettes of various brands. 
As Welden entered, the man steered it up to 
him. He took a londres and surveyed the 
room. 

Near by was a buffet, hospitably inviting. 
On it were decanters of chartreuse and 
maraschino ; flagons of brandy and gin ; bottles of Vichy and Eau de Vals. These latter 
had obviously been attacked. But with that 
abstemiousness which is a characteristic of 
the way we live now, the liquors and liqueurs 
were untouched. 

Contiguously was a billiard table on which 
Cantire, a cigar between his teeth, was knocking balls about. Opposite on a sofa, raised 
by a dais, Solferino sprawled. He looked 
precisely like a fat old woman. 

Idly Welden wondered why his wife had 
accepted him. She was a Murray. The 
Murrays were not brilliant. But in point 
of birth and, for that matter, of breeding, 
her family, like Maud's and like his own, 
were superior, in every way, to any imperial 
spawn. 

He passed on. Beyond was the green 
baize of a baccarat table, about which now 
other men were grouped. Saraguine was 
dealing. The cards which he gave to the 
right, Aquaviva received; those to the left 
went to Malakoff. Behind these the others 
stood and punted. 

Presently, Malakoff, to whom Saraguine 
had furnished an almost uninterrupted 
series of picture cards, got up, and Welden, 
after a circular look of inquiry, took the vacated chair.
