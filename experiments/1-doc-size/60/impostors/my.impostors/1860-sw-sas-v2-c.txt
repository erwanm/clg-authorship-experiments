nothing. Nor did he, upon that subject,--threw it to the winds
apparently. The first move was to take her up stairs again and bestow
her daintily among cushions, then to sit by her and spice her cup of
chicken broth with pepper and talk, till both it and Faith were warm,
and Mrs. Derrick in a state of delight. The good, sweet effect of which
mode of treatment, was shewn in the way "the fringed curtains" of
Faith's eyes were by and by dropped by sleep herself. When she awoke
Mr. Linden was gone; and Mrs. Derrick sat there keeping watch.
"Has the doctor been here, mother?"
"Why child," said her mother, "he's slipped off Stranger, in some of
his capers, and hurt his ancle,--so Reuben says he won't come till
to-morrow. Shall I tell Mr. Linden he may come up?"
"Yes." Faith felt it a relief.
Mr. Linden came to tell her the carriage was ready.
It seemed to Faith as if Jerry knew his old driver, with such good will
did he set forth, with such little snorts of high spirit and tossings
of head and mane. Down the old farm road, among fields of fresh grain
and fresh ploughing, where blue birds sat on the fences, and jocund
dandelions sunned themselves by the wayside. The breeze came fresh into
Faith's face, tossing back her hair; and presently with the scent of
buds and flowers and ploughed land came a mingling of the sea breeze,
for Mr. Linden was driving that way. He was right to make her
come!--Faith felt it in her heart, and so did he. There had been few
words spoken hitherto, but now he turned to her with a smile of great
satisfaction, saying,
"Mignonette, this breeze is telling upon your cheeks."
"It is going all through me!" said Faith, drawing an eager breath of
appreciation. Mr. Linden gave her shawls and cushions some arranging
touches, and to her a glad word or two of answer, then drove on down to
the shore. Not at their usual bathing and picnic place, but at the
further out Barley Point; where the breeze came in its full freshness
and the waves rolled in white-crested. There he made Jerry stand still
for a while, and made Faith lean upon him and so rest.
They were somewhat elevated above the sea, where the barren face of the
land broke down suddenly some twenty feet. With what a sweet dash the
waves broke upon the beach, chasing up the wet sand and laying down a
little freight of seaweed here and there: how the water sparkled and
glittered, and was blue and white and green and neutral tint,--how the
gulls soared and stooped and flapped their wings in the gay breeze,
before which the white-winged vessels flew on a more steady course.
Jerry pawed the turf, and shook his head in approbation, and Faith's
head lay very still. Perhaps Mr. Linden thought she had done talking
enough that day, for he was rather silent; only watching her lest she
should be tired, or have too much of the air. What he watched her for
all the rest of the time, was best known to himself. Her brow had its
old quiet again now, though her face was grave beyond its old wont; and
the eyes, as he could see them, were softly grave and softly glad
together, intently going from the white-tipped water to the
white-winged gulls and the clouds grey and white that sailed above
them. Suddenly, after a long roaming over the fresh life that was
abroad there, the eyes were lifted to his face.
"Endecott--if I don't say anything, it is because I can't say anything
good enough!"
"Faith," he said with that same glad look at her, "your face says that
you are getting better every minute. Not tired yet?"
"I feel as if I was in a grand dream."
"Do you?" said Mr. Linden,--"I am glad I do not. It brings me out of a
dream to see you begin to look like yourself. I have not felt so real
before since I came home."
"You are real enough," said Faith; "and so is everything else. It is
