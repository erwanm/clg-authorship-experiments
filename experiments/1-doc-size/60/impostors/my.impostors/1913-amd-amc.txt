and a little afraid. But he was the best boy 
in school, and brought home a note from his 
teacher, never suspecting his sin would find 
him out so soon. 


Miss Collins asked his mother if she would 
send the reason why Jack was not at school 
yesterday afternoon, as they were required to 
put it down in the record book. 

"Oh, Jack! You didn't go to school yester- 
day afternoon! What were you doing?" 

Jack hung his head, took a little walk, 
and then — and then — I was afraid it was late, 
and some children were playing — 

"Oh, you naughty boy! That is playing 
truant. I don't know what your father 
will say!’’ 

don’t want to any more. I’d rather go to 
school. It wasn’t funny a bit. And I don’t 
want to ride in any old wagon that jounces 
and jounces, and I did get so tired. What 
did the teacher say?” 

'They have to put the true reason down in 
the record book. And there it will stay always. 
My nice little boy was a truant-player. And 
we shall all be so ashamed. What will your 
father say? And he was so afraid last night 
that you were killed!” 

''Oh, mama, I never will do it again, never!” 
Jack hung round his mother’s neck and cried 
and she cried with him, thinking of her tumult 




of agony last night. And she had him safe — 
her little boy! 

"Jack,’ she began presently, '‘can't you 
be brave enough to tell papa how it began. 
Climb up in his lap and tell him how sorry 
and ashamed you are.'’ 

'Will he strap me?" 

"You deserve it I think. But he surely would 
if I told him. And when people do wrong they 
must bear the punishment. 

"But I never will do it again.’’ 

"Tell him that, too.”
