The whole family were gathered ro'und the bed, 
and Mr. Duncan gave them his blessing, for the 
doctors assured him his hour was at hand. We 
will not dwell upon the painful scene. In an hour 
all was still in that room save the sobs of the be- 
reaved widow, who stood gazing in agony upon the 
silent form which she had seen go out from her

Paul was stupefied by the suddenness of the

ceived a solemn charge, and he carefully reviewed 
the words, and recalled the expression with which 
it had been committed to him. His mother and 



 

his brothers and sisters had been given into his 
care, and he felt the responsibility of the position
