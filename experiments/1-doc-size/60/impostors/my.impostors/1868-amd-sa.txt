generous for love, and yet singularly comprehensive. I 
had a faint misgiving that his mother expected it to ripen 
into the rare bloom of that passion ; and Mrs. Lawrence 
smiled an unqualified approval. 

I had a fancy, too, that another watched. Was it for 
his sake? That thought annoyed me. Did Mr. St. John 
fancy that I should take pleasure in idly coquetting with 
such a heart, or did he believe me not worthy of so high a

" Philip is affectionate, confiding, essentially truthful. Is 
it quite right to encourage a love that you do not, cannot 
return ? " 

"Why can I not?" I said, almost defiantly, yet scarcely-
