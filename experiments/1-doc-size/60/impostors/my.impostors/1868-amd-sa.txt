"He means to frighten away any possible lover by 
those portentous looks, and keep you here in his castle 
until you consent to become humble Esther to his mag- 
nificence." 

"A remarkably distant event," I replied, rather curtly. 

"I should hope so. I cannot imagine a woman loving 
him. His haughty pride, imperious will, and cold, dis- 
dainful nature, his lack of tenderness, and his utter ina- 
bility to enjoy the highest and keenest happiness, would

contempt, as if he could have struck some one to the 
earth ; those scornful eyes dilated and sparkling ! What 
unseen fire fed them jealousy or hate ? 

Aylmer opened the conversation in a most courteous 
manner. I debated how I could escape from them both, 
for I knew this covert peace would prove of short dura-
