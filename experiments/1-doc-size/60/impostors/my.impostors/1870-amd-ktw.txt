find it anywhere. I wouldn’t have it lost for any- 
thing.” 

“ No, Eob, I haven’t had it. Let me see, — Janne 
Hall brought it home ? ” 

“ Yes, I ’m sure. It ’s gone, and some one has 
taken it away. It ’s real mean ! ” and poor Eob was 
getting excited. 

Kathie thought a moment or two. “ O Eob, I 
believe I know. The day you were taken sick you 
had it at school, drawing a picture out of it.” 

Eob looked perfectly amazed. It came over him 
like a flash. He hadn’t quite finished the man 
Friday, so he put the book in the corner of his desk 
He could see it all like a picture, 


 


“ Don’t you remember ? ” and Kathie glanced at 
him. Something in her bright eyes said “ Giants ” ; 
and Rob was filled with confusion. 

“ Yes,’ he rejoined, faintly, and then he lay very still. 

“ Kathie,” her mother said, “ I wish you ’d sew a 
little. I ’m quite behindhand.” 

A tear dropped from Rob’s eyes to the pillow. 
How much trouble and interruption he had caused 
his mother ! That about the book was altogether his 
own fault. How could he have been so careless as 
to forget ! He had worried himself too, for his head 
was beginning to ache, and little pains kept crawling 
down his back. And he couldn’t help thinking 
that he ought to fight giants as well as Kathie. 

“ I must try to remember,” he said to himself. 
There was quite a wet spot on the pillow ; and 
presently he turned his face over to the wall, and, 
being completely tired out, fell asleep. 

He little guessed how much pains they all took 
to keep quiet. Freddy didn’t think it much fun 
to play alone, and soon came in, and Aunt Ruth read 
him a story to keep him still. Kathie sewed indus- 
triously until twilight, and then went out to do a few 
errands. Fred desired to go, of course. At first 


 


Kathie wanted to object ; but then she thought it 
wouldn’t be much worse for her to be bothered with 
him than Aunt Kuth and mamma.
