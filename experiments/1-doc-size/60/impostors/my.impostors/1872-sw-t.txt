something."

"What could it tell me?"

"Answer some of your questions, perhaps."

David at last roused to action. He went off upstairs and brought down
his Bible--half a Bible, it looked to Matilda's eyes; and under the
bright gas lights the two sat down to compare notes.

"I don't know but a part of the things that are said about the
Messiah," said David, turning over the leaves; "but what I do know,
seem to me impossible to be fulfilled in him you Gentiles think the
Messiah. And yet--they said--"

David stopped, in great perplexity.

"What are some of those things?"

"Well, this is one. He is to be of the seed of David; for so Isaiah
prophesied."

"'And a rod hath come out from the stock of Jesse, and a branch from
his roots is fruitful. Rested on him hath the Spirit of Jehovah, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,

throne unto the age.' Where is the throne of--of your Messiah, as you
call him? And see here again, in the Psalms of David--

  "'I have made a covenant for my chosen,
  'I have sworn to David my servant,
  'Even to the age do I establish thy seed,
  'And have built from generation to generation thy throne.'"

"What is 'to the age'?" Matilda asked.

"For ever! Where is the throne of your Jesus?"

"It is in heaven," said Matilda promptly.

"But Messiah is to reign on earth."

"Now listen, David; this is what the angel said of Jesus, when he came
to tell Mary that he should be her son. 'He shall be great, and shall
be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him
