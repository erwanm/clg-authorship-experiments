Jack thought, I say, gravely of this girl. He never 
once took her name in vain among the fellows ; and she 
had not been a very good girl either. But Jack re- 
flected that he was not very good himself, if you came 
to that. His downright, honest nature stood him in 
stead in this moral distinction ; there was always a 
broad streak of generosity in him at his worst ; it goes 
with the temperament, we say, and perhaps we say it 
too often to give him half the credit of it. 

She was a pretty girl, and she was very young. She 
had told Jack her story, as they strolled about the 
bright Boston streets on comfortable winter evenings ; 




when he took her to the variety show, or to the oystershop, 
and they talked together. Jack pitied her. Per- 
haps she deserved it ; it was a sad little story — and she 
was so very young ! She had a gentle way, with Jack ; 
for some reason, God knows why, she had trusted him 
from the first, and he had never once been known to dis- 
turb her trust. That was the pleasant part of it. 

On this evening that we speak of, Jack was sober. 
He was often sober when he had an evening to spend 
with the Boston girl ; not always — no ; truth must be 
told. She looked as pretty as was in her that night ; 
she had black eyes and a kind of yellow hair that Jack 
had never seen crinkled low on the forehead above black 
eyes before ; he thought her as fine to look at as any 
actress he ever saw ; for the stage was Jack's standard 
of the magnificent, as it is to so many of his sort. The 
girl's name was Teen. Probably she had been called 
Christine once, in her country home ; she even told Jack 
she had been baptized. 

"I wasn't, myself," said Jack; "I roared so, they 
darsen't do it. My mother got me to church, for she 
was a pious woman, and I pummeled the parson in the 
face with both fists, and she said she come away, for she 
was ashamed of me. She always said that christenin' 
wasn't never legal. It disappointed her, too. I was an 
awful baby." 

"I should think likely," said Teen with candor. " Do 
you set much by your mother ? " 

" She 's dead," said Jack in a subdued voice. Teen 
looked at him ; she had never heard him speak like 
that. 

" I 'most wished mine was," said the girl ; "she 'd 'a' 
ben better off — alonsc of me." 




" That 's so," said Jack.
