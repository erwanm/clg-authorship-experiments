" O, you don't mean — " there was a little convulsive 
catch in her voice. 

"I mean that I love you and want you. I mean a 
great many more things that you will go on finding out 
year by year, if you conclude to take me. Some you 
will like, some won't suit you at all, but you see I am an 
oldish fellow and can't fly around like a weather cock at 
every young girl's whim. But taking it all in all, if you

chance of widowhood. My father is hale and hearty, 
and I feel within me the certain premonitions of old age. 
I shall want to be loved and coddled and cared for — I 
dare say I shall be jealous and unreasonable. I won't 
begin by painting those years in rose color, even if we
