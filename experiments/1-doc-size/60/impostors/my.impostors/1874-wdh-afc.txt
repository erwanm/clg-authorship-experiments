you should not go to America. Well, because I 
think you would starve there." 

" I am used to that," said Don Ippolito ; " and 
besides, until some of my inventions became known, 
I could give lessons in Italian." 

" Oh, bravo I " said Ferris, " you prefer instant 
death, then?" 

" But madamigella seemed to believe that my 
success as an inventor would be assured, there." 

Ferris gave a very ironical laugh. " Miss Ver 
vain must have been about twelve years old when 
she left America. Even a lady's knowledge of busi 
ness, at that age, is limited. When did yon talk 



 

with her about it ? You had not spoken of it to 
me, of late, and I thought you were more contented 
than you used to be." 

" It is true," said the priest. u Sometimes within 
the last two months I have almost forgotten it." 

" And what has brought it so forcibly to your 
mind again ? " 

" That is what I so greatly desire to tell you," 
replied Don Ippolito, with an appealing look at the 
painter's face. He moistened his parched lips a 
little, waiting for further question from the painter, 
to whom he seemed a man fevered by some strong 
emotion and at that moment not quite wholesome. 
Ferris did not speak, and Don Ippolito began 
again : " Even though I have not said so in words 
to you, dear friend, has it not appeared to you that 
I have no heart in my vocation ? " 

" Yes, I have sometimes fancied that. I had no 
right to ask you why." 

" Some day I will tell you, when I have the 
courage to go all over it again. It is partly my 
own fault, but it is more my miserable fortune. 
But wherever the wrong lies, it has at last become 
intolerable to me. I cannot endure it any longer 
and live. I must go away, I must fly from it." 

Ferris shrank from him a little, as men instinc 
tively do from one who has set himself upon some 
desperate attempt. " Do you mean, Don Ippolito, 
that you are going to renounce your priesthood ? " 

Don Ippolito opened his hands and let his priest 
hood drop, as it were, to the ground.
