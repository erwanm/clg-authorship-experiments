in death, "that this ain't my fault ? You'll tell 
em it might have happened anywhere, won't 
you ? Why, it might have happened in a 
church ! There's murders do. You'll say so ; 
won't you, ma am ? " 

Without committing myself on this delicate 
point, I arranged our little programme, securing 
the help of a lovely gray-haired " lady from 
Philadelphia " for this was in the days when 
my own hair was still so dark that I liked to 
be mothered a little in difficult positions. We 
went into the saloon the next Sunday and 
opened our short services. Now, my com 
panion had been trained by Phillips Brooks in 
his younger pastorate, and she was far better 
qualified than I to conduct the service. But 
with the pertinacity of gentle women she 
refused. She would read, she would sing, she 
would help, but speak she would not. 

" You will not ? " pleaded I, " but I cannot. 
I never opened my mouth in a public place 
in my life. I shall drop of stage fright and 
think of the scene ! It will be little less 
exciting than the murder. I am a coward born, 
bred, and graduated on this point. It is morally
impossible for me to speak in that or any 
other place." 

But I prevailed nothing against her, and 
speak I had to. 

 

The saloon was of course packed. It over 
flowed to the porch, and into the street, and 
back through the three little rooms within 
rooms, which, according to my limited observation, 
seem to characterize the grog-shops of 
our native land ; an architectural peculiarity 
into whose causes or effects I have never 
penetrated. 

There were a few women there to sing for 
us, and certain of the wives of the men who 
frequented the shop ; but our hearers were 
chiefly men, and precisely the men who were 
the usual customers of this and kindred places. 
A great, red stain in the floor was covered 
from sight by the crowd. 

To say that the audience was respectful is 
to say little enough. If we had been angels 
from the clouds or courts of heaven, we could 
not have been received with more deference, 
more delicacy, or more attention. To say that 
no disturbance of any kind took place is again 
to say too little for the occasion. Not a foot 
stirred, not a lip whispered ; indeed, it is quite
