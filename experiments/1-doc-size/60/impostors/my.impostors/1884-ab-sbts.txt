the chief reason being that she only once entered the 
room where her husband lay, and that for a few 
minutes. In that little time, Elizabeth had stooped to 
the dead man's ear to whisper : ' If I was wrong, for- 
give me. And I forgive you. I meant to do right, 
but it was so hard." She covered the face softly, glad 
that death had left only his most beautiful self. Love 
was dead in her, but remorse for some fancied duty 
undone, unable as she had been to do it, would still 
linger. 

After the funeral, Jack felt himself to be rather 
awkwardly placed. It was cruel to leave her alone, 
and yet he had no right to stay. Whoever had the

Before he had gone very far in the dilemma, Elizabeth

"No," said Jack, the tears coming into his eyes. 

" I want to be there. I wish you would tell me ex- 
actly what I ought to do." 

The appeal touched Jack to the heart. 

"You want to get away and close the house," he 
said, settling to business. :< But you mean to come 
back to it, by and by ? " 

' Never ! ' with a quick shudder that told its story. 
Afterwards he wondered if it could be possible that 
Mrs. Craig knew her husband too well. 

" But you wouldn't sell the house ? " 

' Yes, if it is mine to sell. And as soon as possi-
