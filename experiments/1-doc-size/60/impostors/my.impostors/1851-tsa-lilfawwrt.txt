Throw the gate over into his field."

Ben looked confounded at this order.

"Do you understand me?" said Mr. Bolton.

"Yes, sir; but"--

"But what?"

"There's no other way for Mr. Halpin's folks to get to the public road."

"That's none of my business; they've no right to make a public highway
of these premises. You heard what I said?"

"Yes, sir."

"Then let it be done."

"Obey orders, if you break owners," muttered Ben, as Mr. Bolton turned
and marched away with long and hasty strides. "But if there isn't a
nice tea-party somewhere about these diggins before to-morrow morning,
my name isn't Ben Johnson."

Before reaching his house, Mr. Bolton's excitement had cooled a trifle,
and it came into his mind that possibly he might have acted a
little hastily; but the order had been given to cut off the right of
way, and he was not the man to "make back-tracks" in any thing.

"Do you see that, Edward?" said Mrs. Bolton, as her husband entered the
house, pointing to a table on which stood a pitcher of sweet cream and
two pounds of fresh butter. "Mrs. Halpin sent these over, with her
compliments, this morning; isn't it kind in her?"

Mrs. Bolton's countenance was glowing with pleasure.

"I always heard that she was a neighbourly, good woman," added Mrs.
Bolton.

"I don't think much of her husband," returned Mr. Bolton, coldly, as he
passed from the room after pausing there for only a moment. He could
not look at the lumps of golden butter and the pitcher of cream without
feeling rebuked, and so he got away as quickly as possible.

"Have you done as I directed?" said Mr. Bolton, with knit brows, on
meeting Ben, some time afterwards, returning from the part of the farm
where he had left him.

"Yes, sir," was the answer of Ben.

"What did you do with the gate?"

"I threw it into the field, as you told me."

"You didn't break it?"

"No, sir."

"Very well."
