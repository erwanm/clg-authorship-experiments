so much misery. At the hotel, an hour 
later, this ambiguity dropped : assisting Mrs. 
Wix in private to refresh and reinvest her- 
self, Maisie heard from her in detail how 
little she could have achieved if Sir Claude 
hadn't put it in her power. It was a phrase 
that, in her room, she repeated in connec- 







tions indescribable: he had put it in her 
power to have "changes," as she said, of the 
most intimate order, adapted to climates and 
occasions so various as to foreshadow in them- 
selves the stages of a vast itinerary. Cheap 
weeks would of course be in their place after 
so much money spent on a governess ; sums 
not grudged, however, by this lady's pupil 
even on her feeling her own appearance give 
rise, through the straighteners, to an atten- 
tion perceptibly mystified. Sir Claude, in 
truth, had had less time to devote to it than 
to Mrs. Wix's; and moreover she would 
rather be in her own shoes than in her 
friend's creaking new ones in the event of an 
encounter with Mrs. Beale. Maisie was too 
lost in the idea of Mrs. Beale's judgment of 
so much newness to pass any judgment her- 
self. Besides, after much luncheon and 
many endearments, the question took quite 
another turn, to say nothing of the pleasure 
of the child's quick view that there were 
other eyes than Susan Ash's to open to what 
she could show. She could n't show much, 
alas, till it stopped raining, which it declined 
to do that day; but this had only the effect 
of leaving more time for Mrs. Wix's own 
demonstration. It came as they sat in the 





little white and gold salon which Maisie 
thought the loveliest place she had ever seen 
except perhaps the apartment of the Coun- 
tess ; it came while the hard summer storm 
lashed the windows and blew in such a chill 
that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets 
and a cigarette in his teeth, fidgeting, frown- 
ing, looking out and turning back, ended by 
causing a smoky little fire to be made in the 
dressy little chimney. It came in spite of 
something that could only be named his air 
of wishing to put it off; an air that had 
served him oh, as all his airs served him !
