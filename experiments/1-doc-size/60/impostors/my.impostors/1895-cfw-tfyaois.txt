"Yes, you are, marmer. Look at your eyes. It's only that you have got
into a way of not thinking so. But I think so, and others shall." He
went back to the sofa, and sank into abstraction again.

At length his mother broke the silence, which had lasted very long. "I
hope they are all well over there to-day?" she asked, hesitatingly.
"Over there" was her name for the house on the shore, the house where
she knew her son had for many weeks spent all his time.

"Well? They're extraordinarily well," said Ash. He got up and walked
restlessly about the room. After a while he stopped, and now he seemed
to have forgotten his mother's presence, for his eyes rested upon her
without seeing her. "One of them is a little too well," he said,
menacingly; "let him look to himself--that's all." And then into his
face, his mother, watching him, saw coming slowly something she knew.
The expression changed him so completely that the ladies who had seen so
much of him would not have recognized their visitor. His mother
recognized him. That expression on her son's face was her life's long
terror.

He left the room. She listened as long as she could hear his steps;
then, after sitting for some time with her head upon her arms on the
table before her, she rose, and went slowly to put on her bonnet and
shawl. Coming back, still slowly, she paused, and for five minutes stood
there motionless. Then her hands dropped desparingly by her sides, and
her worn face quivered. "O God, O our Father, I really don't know what
ter do!" she murmured, breaking into helpless sobs, the stifled,
difficult sobs of a person unaccustomed to self-expression, even the
self-expression of grief.

She did not go out. Instead of that, she went back to the inner room and
knelt down.

The next morning three carriages and two persons on horseback were
following the long road that stretches southward from Salerno to PÃ¦stum.

In the first carriage old Mrs. Preston sat enthroned amid cushions and
shawls; opposite she had placed her nephew Arthur, first because he was
slim, second because he was a man (Mrs. Preston was accustomed to say,
"Too much lady talk dries my brain"); the second carriage held Isabella
Holland and the Abercrombie girls; in the third, a landau drawn by two
spirited horses, were Mrs. Ash and her son. The two persons on horseback
were Pauline Graham and Griffith Carew.

In the soft spring air the mountains that rise all the way on the left
at no great distance from the road had in perfection the vague, dreamy
outlines and violet hues that form so characteristic a feature of the
Italian landscape. Up in the sky their peaks shone whitely, powdered
with snow. The flat plain that stretches from the base of the mountains
to the sea had beauty of another kind; often a fever-swept marsh, it
possessed at this season all a marsh's luxuriance of waving reeds and
flowers and tasselled jungles, with water birds rising from their
feeding-places, and flying along, low down, with a slow motion of their
broad wings, their feet stretched out behind. Troops of buffalo could be
seen here and there. At rare intervals there was an oasis of cultivated
ground, with a solitary farm-house. On the right, all the way, the
Mediterranean, meeting the flat land flatly, stretched forward from
