Touchett was much of the time unconscious ; he slept a great 
deal ; he rarely spoke. Isabel had a great desire to be useful to 
him, and was allowed to watch with him several times when 
his other attendants (of whom Mrs. Touchett was not the least 
regular) went to take rest. He never seemed to know her, and 
ehe always said to herself " Suppose he should die while I am 



 

sitting here ; " an idea which excited her and kept her awake. 
Once he opened his eyes for a while and fixed them upon her 
intelligently, but when she went to him, hoping he would recog- 
nise her, he closed them and relapsed into unconsciousness. 
The day after this, however, he revived for a longer time ; but 
on this occasion Ealph was with him alone. The old man began 
to talk, much to his son's satisfaction, who assured him that they 
should presently have him sitting up. 

" No, my boy!' said Mr. Touchett, " not unless you bury me 
in a sitting posture, as some of the ancients was it the ancients'? 
used to do." 

" Ah, daddy, don't talk about that," Ealph murmured. " You 
must not deny that you are getting better!' 

" There will be no need of my denying it if you don't say so," 
the old man answered. " Why should we prevaricate, just at 
the last? We never prevaricated before. I have got to die 
some time, and it's better to die when one is sick than when 
one is well. I am very sick as sick as I shall ever be. I hope 
you don't want to prove that I shall ever be worse than this   
That would be too bad. You don't 1 Well then." 

Having made this excellent point he became quiet ; but the 
next time that Ralph was with him he again addressed himself 
to conversation. The nurse had gone to her supper and Ralph 
was alone with him, having just relieved Mrs. Touchett, who 
had been on guard since dinner. The room was lighted only by 
the nickering fire, which of late had become necessary, and 
Ralph's tall shadow was projected upon the wall and ceiling, 
with an outline constantly varying but always grotesque. 

" Who is that with me is it my son ?" the old man asked. 

" Yes, it's your son, daddy." 

" And is there no one else ? " 

" No one else." 

Mr. Touchett said nothing for a while ; and then, " I want to 
talk a little," he went on. 

" Won't it tire you 1 " Ralph inquired. 

" It won't matter if it does. I shall have a long rest. I want 
to talk about you."
