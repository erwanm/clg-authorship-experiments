"Well, they are facts.... You see, Mr. Neeland, we English sailors
of the merchant marine are also part of the naval reserve. And we are
supposed to know these things."

Neeland was silent.

"Mr. Neeland," he said, "in case of war between the various powers of
Europe as aligned today, where do you imagine your sympathy would
lie--and the sympathies of America?"

"Both with France and England," said Neeland bluntly.

"You think so?"

"Yes, I do--unless they are the aggressors."

The captain nodded:

"I feel rather that way myself. I feel very sure of the friendliness
of your country. Because of course we--France and England--never would
dream of attacking the Central Powers unless first assailed." He
smiled, nodded toward the box on the floor: "Don't you think, Mr.
Neeland, that it might be safer to entrust those--that box, I mean--to
the captain of the Royal Mail steamer, Volhynia?"

"Yes, I do," said Neeland quietly.

"And--about these spies. Do you happen to entertain any particular
suspicions concerning any of the passengers on my ship?" urged the
captain.

"Indeed, I entertain lively suspicions, and even a few certainties,"
replied the young fellow, laughing.

"You appear to enjoy the affair?"

"I do. I've never had such a good time. I'm not going to spoil it by
suggesting that you lock up anybody, either."

"I'm sorry you feel that way," said the captain seriously.

"But I do. They're friends of mine. They've given me the time of my
life. A dirty trick I'd be serving myself as well as them if I came to
you and preferred charges against them!"

The captain inspected him curiously for a few moments, then, in a soft
voice:

"By any chance, Mr. Neeland, have you any Irish blood in your veins?"

"Yes, thank God!" returned the young fellow, unable to control his
laughter. "And I'll bet there isn't a drop in you, Captain West."

"Not a drop, thank G--I'm sorry!--I ask your pardon, Mr. Neeland!"
added the captain, very red in the face.

But Neeland laughed so hard that, after a moment, the red died out in
the captain's face and a faint grin came into it.
