panion, the " hardware-drummer ! " 

Hal was embarrassed in beginning his farewell talk with 
Mary. He had no idea how she felt towards him, and he 
admitted with a guilty pang that he was a little afraid to 
find out ! He thought it best to be cheerful, so he started 
to tell her how fine he thought her conduct during the 
strike. But she did not respond to his remarks, and at 
last he realised that she was labouring with some thoughts 
of her own. 

" There's somethin' I got to say to ye ! " she began, sud- 
denly. " A couple of days ago I knew how I meant to say 
it, but now I don't." 

" Well ' he laughed, " say it as you meant to." 

" No ; 'twas bitter — and now I'm on my knees before 

ye." 

" Not that I want you to be bitter," said Hal, still laugh- 
ing, " but it's I that ought to be on my knees before you. 
I didn't accomplish anything, you know." 

" Ye did all ye could — and more than the rest of us. 
I want ye to know I'll never forget it. But I want ye to 
hear the other thing, too ! " 

She walked on, staring before her, doubling up her hands 
in agitation. "Well?" said he, still trying to keep a 
cheerful tone. 

" Ye remember that day just after the explosion ? Ye 
remember what I said about — about goin' away with 
ye? I take it back." 

" Oh, of course ! " said he, quickly. " You were dis- 
tracted, Mary — you didn't know what you were saying." 

" No, no f That's not it ! But I've changed my mind ; 
I don't mean to throw meself away." 

" I told you you'd see it that way," he said. " No man 
is worth it." 

" Ah, lad ! " said she. " 'Tis the fine soothin' tongue ye 



 

have — but I'd rather ye knew the truth. 'Tis that I've 
seen the other girl ; and I hate her ! " 

They walked for a bit in silence. Hal had sense 
enough to realise that here was a difficult subject. " I 
don't want to be a prig, Mary," he said gently; " but you'll 
change your mind about that, too. You'll not hate her; 
you'll be sorry for her."
