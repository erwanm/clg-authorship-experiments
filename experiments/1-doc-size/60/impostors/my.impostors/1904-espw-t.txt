took scarcely two hours. 

As Miriam neared the city her mind re- 



 

bounded from her perplexities, and, accord- 
ing to her sweet habit, the troubles of others 
came uppermost. Matthew, who had sat in 
well-trained silence, now shrewdly perceiving 
her change of mood, suddenly inquired : 

" Hain't the gossoon found poor Trixy yet?" 

" We 'll ask," said Miss Lauriat, arousing

and delayed to ring the bell. As she did 
this, the sound that she heard, or thought 
she heard, was plainly repeated. It was a 
sad sound, plaintive and low. She went at 
once into the vestibule, and at its threshold 
stood, staring. Every fleck of color left her 
face. Her heart beat so in her throat that it 
seemed to her she should never draw breath 
again. 

On the black and white mosaic of the mar- 
ble floor, crouched in the corner of the vesti-
