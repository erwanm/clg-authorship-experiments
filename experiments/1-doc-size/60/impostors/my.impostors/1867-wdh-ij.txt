and over all, from vast heights of balcony, with 
people lazily hanging upon rails and looking down 
on the riot. Re entering the stream of the Toledo, 
it carried us almost to the Museo Borbonico before 
we again struck aside into one of the smaller streets, 
whence we climbed quite to the top of one of those 
incredibly high Neapolitan houses. Here, crossing 
an open terrace on the roof, we visited three small 
rooms, in which there were altogether some hundred 
boys in the first stages of reclamation. They were 



 

under the immediate superintendence of Mr. Buscar- 
let, and he seemed to feel the fondest interest in 
them. Indeed, there was sufficient reason for this : 
up to a certain point, the Neapolitan children learn 
so rapidly and willingly that it can hardly be other 
than a pleasure to teach them. After this, their 
zeal flags ; they know enough ; and their parents and 
friends, far more ignorant than they, are perfectly 
satisfied with their progress. Then the difficulties 
of their teachers begin ; but here, in these lowest 
grade schools, they had not yet begun. The boys 
were still eager to learn, and were ardently following 
the lead of their teachers. They were little fellows, 
nearly all, and none of them had been in school 
more than a year and a half, while some had been 
there only three or four months. They rose up 
with " Buon giorno, signori" as we entered, and 
could hardly be persuaded to lapse back to the duties 
of life during our stay. They had very good faces, 
indeed, for the most part, and even the vicious had 
intellectual brightness. Just and consistent usage 
has the best influence on them ; and one boy was 
pointed out as quite docile and manageable, whose 
parents had given him up as incorrigible before he 
entered the school. As it was, there was something 
almost pathetic in his good behavior, as being pos- 
sible to him, but utterly alien to his instincts. The 
boys of these schools seldom play truant, and they 
are never severely beaten in school ; when quite in- 
tractable, notice is given to their parents, and they 
usually return in a more docile state. It sometimes 





happens that the boys are taken away by their 
parents, from one motive or another ; but they find 
their way back again, and are received as if nothing 
had happened. 

The teacher in the first room here is a handsome 
young Calabrian, with the gentlest face and manner, 
one of the most efficient teachers under Mr. 
Buscarlet. The boys had out their Bibles when we
