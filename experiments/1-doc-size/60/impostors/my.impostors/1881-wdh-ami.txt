"Well, that 's pretty much my complaint, too," said 
Bartley, " though I couldn 't have expressed it so well." 

" Oh, you express ! " she murmured, with the pride 
in him which implied that there were no thoughts 
worth expressing to which he could not give a monu 
mental utterance. Her adoration flattered his self- 
love to the same passionate intensity, and to some 
thing like the generous complexion of her worship. 

" Marcia," he answered, " I am going to try to be 
all you expect of me. And I hope I shall never do 
anything unworthy of your ideal." 

She could only press his arm again in speechless 
joy, but she said to herself that she should always 
remember these words. 

The wind had been rising ever since they started, 
but they had not noticed it till now, when the woods 
began to thin away on either side, and he stopped 
before striking out over one of the naked stretches 
of the plain, a white waste swept by the blasts 
that sucked down through a gorge of the mountain, 
and flattened the snow-drifts as the tornado flattens

turn-out." 

" Oh, well, look carefully, Bartley. If we met 
any one beyond the turn-out, I don 't know what I 
should do," pleaded the girl. 

" I don 't know what they would do," said Bartley. 
" But it 's their lookout now, if they come. Wrap 
your face up well, or put your head under the robe. 
I 've got to hold my breath the next half-mile." He 
loosed the reins, and sped the colt out of the shel 
ter where he had halted. The wind struck them like 
an edge of steel, and, catching the powdery snow that 
their horse 's hoofs beat up, sent it spinning and swirl
