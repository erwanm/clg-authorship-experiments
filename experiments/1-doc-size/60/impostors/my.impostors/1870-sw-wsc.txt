"But, Mr. Richmond" 

" What is it ? " 

" There is one question I should like to 
ask." 



Ask it." 

" Why ought people to be baptized ? " 

Because our Lord commands it. Isn't 
that a good reason ? " 

" Yes, sir; but what does it mean, Mr. 
Richmond ? " 

" It is a way of saying to the world, that 
we have left it, and belong to the Lord 
Jesus Christ. It is a way of saying to the 
world, that his blood has washed away our 
sins and his Spirit has made our hearts clean ; 
or that we trust him to do both things for us. 
And it is the appointed way of saying all 
this to the world ; his appointed way. Do 
you understand ? " 

" Yes, sir." 

" Now do you not think that those who 
love the Lord Jesus, ought to be glad to 
follow his will in this matter ? " 

" Yes, sir," Matilda said again, raising hei 
eyes frankly to Mr. Richmond's face. 

" "Would you be willing to be left out, 
when next I baptize some of those who wish 




to make it publicly known that they are 
Christ's?" 

" No, sir." And presently she added. 
" When will that be, Mr. Richmond ? " 

" I do not know," he answered thoughtfully. " Not immediately. You and I must 
have some more talks before that time." 

" You are very good to me, Mr. Rich- 
mond," Matilda said gratefully. 

" Have we said all we ought to say this 
time ? Are there any more questions to 
bring up ? "
