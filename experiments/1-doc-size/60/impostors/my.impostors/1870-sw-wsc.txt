said ; " she is not cross ; she is worried. I 
know she is worried." 

" About Mr. Richmond ? " said Maria. 

" I don't know about what. No, I guess 
she was worried before we came back." 

" She was cross anyhow ! " said Maria. 
'' How can one do everything perfectly ! " 

" But that is just what Mr. Richmond said," 
Matilda urged gently. 

"What?" 

" That we should be light - bearers, you 



 

know. That is the way to be a light-bearer; 
to do everything perfectly." 

" Well, you may, if you can," said Maria. 
I can't." 




CHAPTER VIII. 

"FINALLY, that money burns ray pocket," 

 Maria said the next morning. 

"Then you had better put it somewhere, 
else." 

" I suppose you think that is smart," said 
Maria, " but it isn't ; for that is just what I 
mean to do. I mean to spend it, somehow." 

"What for?" 

" That's just what I don't know. There 
are so many things I want : and I do not know 
what I want most. I have a good mind to 
buy a writing desk, for one thing." 

" Why you have got one already." 

" I mean a handsome one, a real beauty, 
large, you know, and with everything in it. 
That lock of mine isn't good. Anybody could 
open it."
