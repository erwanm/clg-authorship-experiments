" I don't know," she whispered. 
"Wait for what?" 
" Till T was more like what I ought to 
be, Mr. Richmond." 
"Till you were more like the Lord Jesus ? " 
Yes, sir." 
"Do you not think the quickest way to 
grow like him would be to do and obey 
every word he says ? " 
Matilda bowed her head a little. 
" You will be more likely to grow good 
and strong that way than any other ; and I 
am sure the Lord will be more likely to help 
you if you trust him, than if you do not 
trust him." 
" I think so too," Matilda assented.

" Yes, sir," Matilda said again, raising hei 
eyes frankly to Mr. Richmond's face. 
" "Would you be willing to be left out, 
when next I baptize some of those who wish 
to make it publicly known that they are

" No, sir." And presently she added. 
" When will that be, Mr. Richmond ? " 
" I do not know," he answered thoughtfully. " Not immediately. You and I must
