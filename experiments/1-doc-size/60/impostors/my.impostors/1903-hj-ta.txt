go? 

" I'll go if you'll say you now consider I should. You 
know," he went on, " I was ready six weeks ago." 

" Ah," said Strether, " that was when you didn't know / 
wasn't ! You're ready at present because you do know it." 

"That may be," Chad returned ; "but, all the same, I'm 
sincere. You talk about taking the whole thing on your 
shoulders, but in what light do you regard me that you 
think me capable of letting you pay?" Strether patted 
his arm, as they stood together against the parapet, re- 
assuringly — seeming to wish to contend that he had the 
wherewithal ; but it was again round this question of 
purchase and price that the young man's sense of fairness 
continued to hover. " What it literally comes to for you, 
if you'll pardon my putting it so, is that you give up 
money. Possibly a good deal of money." 

" Oh," Strether laughed, " if it were only just enough 
you'd still be justified in putting it so ! But I've on my

I shan't starve." 

" Oh, you mustn't starve f" Chad pacifically emphasised ; 
and so, in the pleasant conditions, they continued to talk ; 
though there was, for that matter, a pause in which the 
younger companion might have been taken as weighing 
again the delicacy of his then and there promising the 
elder some provision against the possibility just mentioned. 
This, however, he presumably thought best not to do, for 
at the end of another minute they had moved in quite 
a different direction. Strether had broken in by returning 
to the subject of Chad's passage with Sarah, and inquiring 
if they had arrived, in the event, at anything in the nature 
of a " scene," To this Chad replied that they had, on the 
contrary, kept tremendously polite ; adding, moreover, 





that Sally was after all not the woman to have made the si 
mistake of not being. " Her hands are a good deal tied, ,1 
you see. I got so, from the first," he sagaciously observed, ,i 
" the start of her." , 

" You mean she has taken so much from you ? " 

" Well, I couldn't, of course, in common decency, give
