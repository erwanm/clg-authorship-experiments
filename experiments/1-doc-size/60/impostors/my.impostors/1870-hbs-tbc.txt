spirit.

Accordingly, his first attack against this 'lady,' as we Americans
should call her, consists in gross statements concerning her having
been born poor and in an inferior rank. He begins by stating that she
was

  'Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,
  Promoted thence to deck her mistress' head;
  Next--for some gracious service unexpressed
  And from its wages only to be guessed--
  Raised from the toilet to the table, where
  Her wondering betters wait behind her chair.
  With eye unmoved and forehead unabashed.
  She dines from off the plate she lately washed;
  Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,
  The genial confidante and general spy,--
  Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess,--
  An only infant's earliest governess!
  What had she made the pupil of her art
  None knows; but that high soul secured the heart,
  And panted for the truth it could not hear
  With longing soul and undeluded ear!'[4]

The poet here recognises as a singular trait in Lady Byron her peculiar
love of truth,--a trait which must have struck everyone that had any
knowledge of her through life. He goes on now to give what he certainly
knew to be the real character of Lady Byron:--

  'Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,
  Which flattery fooled not, baseness could not blind,
  Deceit infect not, nor contagion soil,
  Indulgence weaken, or example spoil,
  Nor mastered science tempt her to look down
  On humbler talent with a pitying frown,
  Nor genius swell, nor beauty render vain,
  Nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain.

We are now informed that Mrs. Clermont, whom he afterwards says in his
letters was a spy of Lady Byron's mother, set herself to make mischief
between them. He says:--

  'If early habits,--those strong links that bind
  At times the loftiest to the meanest mind,
  Have given her power too deeply to instil
  The angry essence of her deadly will;
  If like a snake she steal within your walls,
  Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;
  If like a viper to the heart she wind,
  And leaves the venom there she did not find,--
  What marvel that this hag of hatred works
  Eternal evil latent as she lurks.'

The noble lord then proceeds to abuse this woman of inferior rank in
the language of the upper circles. He thus describes her person and
manner:--

  'Skilled by a touch to deepen scandal's tints
