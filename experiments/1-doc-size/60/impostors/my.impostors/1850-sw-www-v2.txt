" You are thinking that is hardly possible ?" said John 
with a smile. 

" I suppose it is possible," said Ellen, — " but — " 

" But lovely as this world is, Ellie, man has filled it with 
sin, and sin has everywhere brought its punishment, and 
under the weight of both the earth groans. There will be 
no sin there ; sorrow and sighing shall flee away ; love to 
each other and love to their blessed King will fill all hearts, 
and his presence will be with them. Don't you see that 
even if that world shall be in itself no better than this, it will 
yet be far, far more lovely than this can ever be with the 
shadow of sin upon it ?" 

" yes !" said Ellen. " I know whenever I feel wrong 
in any way nothing seems pretty or pleasant to me, or not 
half so much." 







" Very well," said John, — " I see you understand me. I 
like to think of that land, Ellen, — very much." 

" Mr. John," said Ellen, — " don't you think people will

Before either John or Ellen had broken the long musing fit

grew too strong for words, and silence again stole upon the 
group. The short winter day came to an end ; the sunhght 
faded away into moonlight. Ko shadows lay now on the 
lawn ; and from where she sat Ellen could see the great 
hemlock all silvered with the moonlight which began to steal 
in at the window. It was very, very beautiful ; — yet she 
could think now without sorrow that all this should come to 
an end ; because of that new heaven and new earth wherein 
righteousness should dwell. 

" We have eaten up all your grapes, Ellie," said Alice, — 
or rather I have, for John didn't help me much. I think I 
never ate so sweet grapes in my life ; John said the reason 
was because eveiy one tasted of you." 

" I am very glad," said Ellen laughing. 

" There is no evil without some good," Alice went on ; — 
" except for my headache John would not have held my head
