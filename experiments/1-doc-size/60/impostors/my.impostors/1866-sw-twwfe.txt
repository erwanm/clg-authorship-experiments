"But it was grand to live so long," said Liph. 

" In a wicked world ? No. For wickedness went on with 
great strides, for the same reason that knowledge and arts 
did ; long life gave people a great chance to do mischief, 
and made them feel secure in it In spite of the fact that 
Adam was living, and could tell them all his story ; though 
Cain carried about the mark of God's curse upon him ; 
though Enoch preached and Noah prophesied— what did all 
that matter to people who had a thousand years to live ? 
So they went their own way, and lived lives of violence and 



 

selfishness, until God saw that the wickedness of man was 
great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts 
of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the 
Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved 
him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man 
whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man, 
and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air.' " 

" Why must they be killed, uncle Sam ?" 

" The whole place was so foul. Tiny, the Lord would wash 
it all away, and make a new world for a new family." 

" I should think Adam would have been glad to shut his 
eyes upon it," said my grandmother. 

" I have no doubt he was. His children were bom in his 
likeness, and his heart must have been bitter within him 
when he saw what sort of a likeness it was. Let us hope he 
had the comfort of knowing that ' as in Adam all die, even 
80 in Christ shall all be made alive.' " 

" What does that mean, uncle Sam ? " 

" It means this, Tiny. That Adam stood as the father of 
all mankind, and by sinning drew down a curse upon them ; 
and that Jesus stood as the Saviour of all mankind, and by 
doing lifted the curse off. Life is bought for everybody, 
unless they persist in going on to sin ; if they do, there remaineth no more sacrifice for them." 

" Uncle Sam," I said, " I guess Adam knew it" 

" I think he did. Tiny. And in this record of him and 
Seth's children, which tells how long he lived, and when 
each died, there is a beautiful account given of two among 
them. Enoch 'walked with God' — and so did Noah. In 
the midst of all the wickedness and confusion around them, 
those two men walked mith God." 

" How is that, uncle Sam ? " said I, when all the others 
were silent. 

" How is it when you and I go into the forest together ? "
