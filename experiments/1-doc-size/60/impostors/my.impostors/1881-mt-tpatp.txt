oft these days doth my memory play the traitor with 
me. . . . ’Tis strange, strange — ” 

The king dropped into inarticulate mumblings, 
shaking his gray head weakly from time to time, and 
gropingly trying to recollect what he had done with 
the Seal. At last my Lord Hertford ventured to 
kneel and offer information — 

“Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several 
that do remember with me how that you gave the 

Great Seal into the hands of his Highness the Prince 
of Wales to keep against the day that — ”

rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly 
his face flushed with wrath: 

“What, thou here yet! By the glory of God, 
an thou gettest not about that traitor’s business,
