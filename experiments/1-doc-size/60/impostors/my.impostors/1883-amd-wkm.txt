could he say to his darling, with her fresh, pure heart, that 
would not somehow shadow it ? 



CHAPTER VIII. 

KATHIE declared she meant to begin living in real earnest, 
and practised her music for an hour, then read with Uncle 
Robert. 

" But it seems all for myself," she said. " Ought it not 
be something wider and better? Why, I used to be such 
a busy little girl ! " 

" I think you will find your hands full presently." 

Indeed, just after luncheon, Mrs. Alston asked her to 
attend to some kindly errand for her, and when she re- 
turned Fay and Louise Collamore had come ; so the girls 
had a chatty and delightful time, talking over all the hap- 
piness. They were very glad to get Kathie back again, 
and before their visit had ended, Georgie Halford came to 
insist that she should join the archery club. 

No, the days were not likely to hang heavily on her 
hands. Eugene Collamore began to haunt her like a 
shadow. Their cousins came from the city for a fortnight, 
and there were teas, and discussions on needle- work and 
painting and music. 

" If one could only tell just how much of one's life ought 
to be given to these pleasures," Kathie said to her mother. 
" It is so lovely to be flitting from one thing to another 
like a butterfly, enjoying all, and tiring of none. Do I 
waste my time, mamma?" 

"My dear, there is a season of enjoyment as well as 
study and work. I think your mission just now is to make 
us all happy ; and you do that." 

" Thank you," with a fond kiss. 




Then the invitations for Lucy Gardiner's marriage were 
sent out. It was to be in church. Harrj- Cox had a very 
nice position in one of the mills, and they were to have 
their house furnished and ready for living when they came 
back from their wedding journey. Kathie went over it 
with Lucy, and pleased the young girl by her ready admi- 
ration. It was neat and pretty, some of the furnishing 
Lucy's own handiwork. 

" Kathie," she said, when they had inspected everything, 
"it is so nice not to have you proud and over-critical. 
You have seen so many beautiful and costly articles, and 
you can have almost anything yourself; and if you were 
going to be married there would be such a time."
