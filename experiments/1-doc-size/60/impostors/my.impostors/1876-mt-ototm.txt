"Oh, I knew him. Sallow-faced, red-headed 
fellow, with a little scar on the side of his throat 
like a splinter under the ttesh. He was only in the 
Southern trade six months. That was thirteen 
years ago. I made a trip with him. There was 
five feet in the upper river then ; the Honry Blake 
grounded at the foot of Tower Island, drawing four 
and a half ; the George Elliott unshipped her 
rudder on the wreck of the Sunflower " — 
" Why, the Sunflower did'nt sink until " — 
"  know wlien she sunk ; it was three years 
before that, on the 2d of December; Asa Hardy 
was captain of her, and his brother John was first 
clerk; and it was his first trip in her, too; Tom 
Jones told me these things a week afterward in 
New Orleans ; he was first mate of the Sunflower. 
Captain Hardy stuck a nail in his foot the 6th of 
July of the next year, and died of the lock; aw on 
the 15th. His brother John died two years after, — 
3d of March, — erysipelas. I never saw either of the 
Hardys, — they were Alleghany River men, — but 
people who knew them told me all these things. 
And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn socks 
winter and summer just the same, and his first 
wife's name was Jane Shook, — she was from New 
England, — and his second one die in a lunatic 
asylum. It was in the blood. She was from Lexington, 
Kentucky. Name was Horton before she was married." 

And HO on, by the hour, the man's tongue would 
go. He could not forget anything. It was simply 
impossible. The most trivial details remained as 
distinct and luminous in his head, after they had 
lain there for years, as the most memorable 
events. His was not simply a pilot's memory ; its 
grasp was universal. If he were talking about a 
trifling letter he had received seven years before, 
he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed 
from memory. And then, witliout observing that 
he was departing from the true line of his talk, he 
was more than likely to hurl in a long-drawn par- 
enthetical biography ol the writer of that letter ; 
and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up 
that writer's relatives, one by one, and give you 
their biographies, too. 

Such a memory as that is a gi'eat misfortune. To 
it, all occurrences are ol the same size. Its posses- 
sor cannot distinguish an interesting circumstance 
from an uninteresting one. As a talker, he is bound 
to clog his narrative with tiresome details and make 
himself an insufferable bore. Moreover, he cannot 
stick to his subject. He picks up every little grain 
of memory he discerns in his way, and so is led 

aside. Mr. J would start out with the honest
