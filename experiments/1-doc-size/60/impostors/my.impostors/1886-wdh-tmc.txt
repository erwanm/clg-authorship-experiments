reading ? " 

Lemuel reflected, and then he said he thought 
you ought to find out about such things if you 
got a chance. 

" Yes," said the editor musingly, " I suppose one 
oughtn't to throw any sort of chance away. But 
you're  sure you don't prefer the novels ? You'll 
excuse my asking you ? " 

"Oh, perfectly excusable," said Lemuel. He 
added that he liked a good novel too, when he 
could get hold of it. 

" You must come to my room some day, and see if 
you can't get hold of one there. Or if you prefer

you a little hint that I' m too old to profit by : 
remember that you can lend a person more books in 
a day than he can read in a week." 

His laugh kept Lemuel shy of him still, in spite 
of a willingness that the editor showed for their 
.better acquaintance. He seemed to wish to know 
about Lemuel, particularly since he had recognised 
the pursuer of the horse-car in him, and this made 
Lemuel close up the more. He would have liked to 
talk with him about the books Evans had lent him. 
But when the editor stopped at the office door, 
where Lemuel sat reading one of them, and asked
