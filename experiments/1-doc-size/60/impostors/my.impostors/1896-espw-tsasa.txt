smelling-salts fell upon the cushioned seat ; she held 
her feathered fan against her face. Her husband 
did not even notice this. He sat with head bowed 
upon the rail before him, as a good man does when 
reconsecrating himself at the communion hour. 

The choir rustled uneasily in their seats. The 
soprano covered her eyes with her well-gloved hand, 
and thought of the follies and regrets (she called 
them by these names) that beset the musical 
temperament. But the tenor turned his face away, 
and thought about his wife. Down the avenue, in 
the room of the " shut-in " woman, where the tele- 


phone carried the preacher's voice, a pathetic cry 
was heard : 

" Forgive ! Forgive ! Oh, if suffering had but 
made me better ! " 

But now the preacher's manner of address had 
changed again. Always remembering that it is now 
impossible to quote his language with any accuracy, 
we may venture to say that it ran in some such way 
as this : 

The Son of God, being of the Father, performed 
his Father's business. What do ye who bear his 
name ? What holy errands are ye about ? What

marvels of the soul's life have ye achieved upon the 
earth since he left it to your trust ? 

He came to the sinful and the unhappy ; the 
despised and rejected were his friends ; to the poor 
he preached the Gospel ; the sick, and overlooked, 
and cast-out, the unloved and forgotten, the un 
fashionable and unpopular, he selected. These to 
his church on earth he left in charge. These he 
cherished. For such he had lived. For them he 
had suffered. For them he died. People of Saint 
Agatha's, where are they ? What have ye done to 
his beloved? Thou ancient church, honored and 
privileged and blessed among men, where are those 
little ones whom thy Master chose ? Up and down 
these godly aisles a man might look, he said, and 
see them not. Prosperity and complacency he saw 
before him ; poverty and humility he did not see. 
In the day when habit cannot reply for duty, what 
account will ye give of your betrayed trust? Will 
ye say : " Lord, we had a mission chapel. The 
curate is responsible for the lower classes. And, 
Lord, we take up the usual collections ; Saint Agatha's 
has always been called a generous church"? 

In the startled hush that met these preposterous 
words the preacher drew himself to his full height, 
and raised his hand. He had worn the white gown 
throughout the day's services, and the garment
