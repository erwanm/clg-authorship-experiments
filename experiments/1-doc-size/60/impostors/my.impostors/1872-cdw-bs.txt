for genuine high-shoulderness we are not exceed 
ed by any church in the city. / Our chapel in the 
"rear is as Gothic as the rest of it, a beautiful 
little edifice. The committee forgot to make any 
more provision for ventilating that, than the 
church, and it takes a pretty well-seasoned Chris- 



 

tian to stay in it long at a time. The Sunday 
school is held there, and it is thought to be best 

to accustom the children to bad air before they 

go into the church. The poor little dears should 

n't have the wickedness and impurity of this 
world break on them too suddenly. J If the stran 
ger noticed any lack about our church, it would 
be that of a spire. There is a place for one ; 
indeed, it was begun, and then the builders seem 
to have stopped, with the notion that it would 
grow itself from such a good root. It is a mis 
take, however, to suppose that we do not know 
that the church has what the profane here call 
a " stump-tail " appearance. But the profane are 
as ignorant of history as they are of true Gothic. 
All the Old World cathedrals were the work of 
centuries. That at Milan is scarcely finished 
yet ; the unfinished spires of the Cologne cathe 
dral are one of the best-known features of it. I 
doubt if it would be in the Gothic spirit to finish 
a church at once. We can tell cavillers that we 
shall have a spire at the proper time, and not 
a minute before. It may depend a little upon 
what the Baptists do, who are to build near us. 



 

I, for one, think we had better wait and see how 
high the Baptist spire is before we run ours up. 
The church is everything that could be desired 
inside. There is the nave, with its lofty and 
beautiful arched ceiling ; there are the side aisles, 
and two elegant rows of stone pillars, stained so 
as to be a perfect imitation of stucco ; there is 
the apse, with its stained glass and exquisite 
lines ; and there is an organ-loft over the front 
entrance, with a rose window. Nothing was 
wanting, so far as we could see, except that we 
should adapt ourselves to the circumstances ; and 
that we have been trying to do ever since. It 
may be well to relate how we do it, for the bene 
fit of other inchoate Goths. 

It was found that if we put up the organ in
