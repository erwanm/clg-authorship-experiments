it was said, waited to be confessed by him b
efore she could join in the dance with a cleat 
conscience. He now attended her zealously, 
counting his beads. 

As he was masked, there was a little specula 
tion at first as to his identity, till some one sug 
gested Jane Bruce. 

" Rather tall for Jane, seems to me." 

" Why, no ; Jane is tall, and it makes such a 
difference going without hoops." 

" It must be Jane," decided Gypsy, " for 
when I asked her what she should be, she said 
she did not know certainly that she should 
come, but if she did, she should probably be a 
monk; that is the quickest thing to get up; 
you know there 's that old black cloth up 
garret that Mrs. M. said we might use." 

So nobody thought any more about the 
Benedictine friar, and when, sometime before 
the party broke up, he went away, he was 
hardly missed. 

" Tired, I suppose," thought Gypsy, " she 
has gone to bed." 

The girls kept, up their merry play till tea 

o'clock; Dolly brought in the oysters, Mrs. 
McMunn thanked them for the entertainment, 
and they broke up with a sense of brilliant 
success. 

Queen Marie and her page made their adieu* 
to Emma Colchett together (poor Emma had 
to be hostess and musician in one), and went 
upstairs. Maude Clare did look magnificently 
that night. Her cheeks were hot with ner 
vous colour, and her eyes dry and bright, with 
excitement. 

" Maude, you are just beautiful ! " said 
her pretty page, throwing his most unpagelike 
arms about her neck. 

"Thank you, dear," said Maude Clare wea 
rily, shrinking a little from her caress. " I am 
tired. I think I will go to bed. See, poor 
Miss Holly wants to go to sleep, and we should 
disturb her talking." 

Jane was in bed and asleep when Gypsy went 
to her room. The next morning the girls as 
sembled to talk over the masquerade, and 
strange fact came out.
