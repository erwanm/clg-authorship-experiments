stay here. I must go." 

He struggled to rise, while March held him by 
the coat, and implored him under his voice, "For 
Heaven's sake, don't, Lindau ! You owe it to your- 
self not to make a scene, if you come here." Some- 
thing in it all affected him comically ; he could not 
help laughing. 

The others were discussing the matter, and seemed 
not to have noticed Lindau, who controlled himself 
and sighed : " You are right. I must have patience." 

Beaton was saying to Dryfoos, " Pity your Pinker- 
tons couldn't have given them a few shots before 
they left." 



  

"No, that wasn't necessary," said Dryfoos. "I 
succeeded in breaking up the union. I entered into 
an agreement with other parties not to employ any 
man who would not swear that he was non-union. 
If they had attempted violence, of course they could 
have been shot. But there was no fear of that. 
Those fellows can always be depended upon to cut 
each other's throats in the long-run." 

"But sometimes," said Colonel Woodburn, who 
had been watching throughout for a chance to mount 
his hobby again, " they make a good deal of trouble 
first. How was it in the great railroad strike of " 

"well, I guess there was a little trouble that 
time, colonel," said Fulkerson. "But the men that 
undertake to override the laws and paralyse the 
industries of a country like this generally get left in 
the end." 

"Yes, sir, generally; and up to a certain point, 
always. But it's the exceptional that is apt to 
happen, as well as the unexpected. And a little 
reflection will convince any gentleman here that 
there is always a danger of the exceptional in your 
system. The fact is, those fellows have the game in 
their own hands already. A strike of the whole 
body of the Brotherhood of Engineers alone would 
starve out the entire Atlantic seaboard in a week ; 
labour insurrection could make head at a dozen given 
points, and your government couldn't move a man 
over the roads without the help of the engineers." 

"That is so," said Kendrick, struck by the 




dramatic character of the conjecture. He imagined
