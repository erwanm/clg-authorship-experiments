he gave way before the strain and the burden of 
years. Eight days he lay on his bed, and yet 
wrestled with God that he would not let him die 
before he had seen the conversion of his children. 
He sent messages to them, telling them that he was 
sick ; they never came near him. He sent to en 
treat them to come and receive his fatherly bless 
ing ; they answered, they did not want it. And so 
all hope seemed to melt away. But the Scripture 
says with truth, that Love is stronger than Death. 
And if human love upon earth is so strong, how 
great and strong must not the love of Jesus be I 

" ' One morning, Landolf was sitting beside his 
friend's couch, trying to comfort him, and as he 
thought, to prepare him for death, when in came 
Schwerting, the youngest of Heinrich's sons, and 
spoke : " Father, Ikia wants you. She is sick unto 
death, and wishes to ask you to forgive her; she 
sent me to you. But you cannot come," he went 



 

on; "you are sick unto death yourself, and it may 
be will die now before Ikia, your child ; and she 
is so troubled! for she has never seen you again 
since that day on the island, and that is her fault ! " 
At this, something like the glow of the sunlight 
swept over Heinrich's pale face, and leaning over 
to Landolf's ear, he whispered to him: "Pray to 
Christ with me, that I may go to Ikia, my daughter; and you will go along, that I may see her bap 
tized." And Landolf kneels down by his friend's 
couch and prays, and Heinrich on his bed joins in 
the prayer, and they hold up to the Lord the word 
that he had given "If two of you shall agree on 
earth as touching anything that ye shall ask, it 
shall be done for them of my Father which is in 
heaven;" and they doubt not that he is the Al 
mighty and living God; therefore they ask that 
He will give strength and grace, that Heinrich 
may come to his daughter Ikia and see her baptism. And when they had finished praying, Hein 
rich rose up from his couch; bade them bring his 
horse ; begged his friend and his son to help him 
to mount; and when he was seated on the beast's 
back he went forward, up the Oerze, towards the 
sanctuary of Freija, where Ikia was priestess. Lan 
dolf on one side, Schwerting on the other side, led 
the horse, and supported the tottering old man. 
Whoever met the procession joined it, for Gad's 
hand was plainly there; and after three hours of 
travelling Heinrich reached Ikia. He found her 
dying, but still in full possession of her senses. A 



 

happy smile flowed over her death-white features.
