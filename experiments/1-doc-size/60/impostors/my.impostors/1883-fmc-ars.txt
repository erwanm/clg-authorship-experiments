I hope you will." 

"Grazie! And then?" 

" Eh, it might not be such a bad thing, after all. 
For if you could be induced to give up the stage " 

"I I, give up singing?" he cried, indignantly. 

" Oh, such things happen, you know. If you were 
to give it up, as I was saying, you might then possibly use your mind. A mind is a much better thing 
than a throat, after all." 

"Ebbene! talk as much as you please, for, of 
course, you have the right, since you have brought 
me up, and you have certainly opposed my singing 



 

enough to quiet your conscience. But, dear professore, I will do all that I say, and if you will give me

"Help? Dio mio! What do you take me for? 
As if I could help you, or would ! I suppose you 
want money to make yourself a dandy, a pamo, to 
go and stand at the corner of the Piazza Colonna and 
ogle her as she goes by! In truth! You have fine 
projects." 

"No," said Nino, quietly, "I do not want any 
money, nor anything else, at present, thank you. 
And do not be angry, but come into the caff and 
drink some lemonade; and I will invite you to it, 
for I have been paid for my last copying, which I 
sent in yesterday." 

He put his arm in mine, and we went in. There 
is no resisting Nino, when he is affectionate. But 
I would not let him pay for the lemonade. I paid 
for it myself. What extravagance ! 



 



CHAPTER III. 

Now I ought to tell you that many things in this 
story were only told me quite lately ; for at first I 
would not help Nino at all, thinking it was but a 
foolish fancy of his boy's heart and would soon pass. 
I have tried to gather and to order all the different 
incidents into one harmonious whole, so that you can 
follow the story ; and you must not wonder that I can 
describe some things which I did not see, and that I 
know how some of the people felt; for Nino and I
