all unheeded in her kindly zeal, — 

" Mrs. Ramsay, here is a seat for you. Drive with us, 
won't you ? " 

Mrs. Ramsay managed her difficult exit through the tur- 
moil, and, finding the step, lifted a substantial foot to it. 
Bess, in a flash, was out on the other side, after her little 
apologetic petition to Catherine : — 

" I 'd like to walk. Please let me. Celia, you come, too." 

With a charming word to Mrs. Ramsay, Celia followed

eyes. Bess sang the " Wearing of the Green " then, and 
young Erin joined her, and, in some danger of drowning
