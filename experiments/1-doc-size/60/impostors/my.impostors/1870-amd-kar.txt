uncle, laughingly. " I was talking to Mr. Grayson 
about the Academy, and I find that he is very well 
satisfied with it." 

" Oh," exclaimed Mrs. Alston, " I don't want Eob to 
go away from home at present. And now the idea 
of his growing to manhood is not attractive. My 
little Eob ! ' : and his mother placed her hand affec- 
tionately on his shoulder. 

" But I 'm not to be a baby always," he said, with 
a good deal of big-boy dignity. 





" I used to think," said Kathie, " that our good 
fortune would begin when Eob was a man and could 
work for us." 

Eob felt in his heart that he was very well satisfied 
to have the good fortune now. 

" So I think it will be best for Eob to try the 
Academy for a year at least." 

"The boys are snobby/' declared Eob, "all but 
Dick Grayson, and old Crittenden 's awful strict ; 
they don't have but precious little fun." 

" The fun had better be out of school, my boy/' 
returned his uncle, gravely. "Fred must keep on 
where he is, I suppose, for they have no pupils 
younger than ten at the Academy." 

Eob was rather delighted with this, though he did 
not say so ; but Freddy was as bad as the Old Man 
of the Mountains to him. 

" And what am I to do ? " asked Kathie. 

" We are coming to that. Aunt Euth thinks she 
may want you presently. Dr. Markham desires her 
to come to "New York about the middle of next 
month, and it will be best for your mamma to go 
with her." 

Kathie slipped her hand within Aunt Euth's. 



 

Part of Uncle Eobert's errand to the city had been 
to make arrangements for Aunt Euth's removal; 
and though she was very much interested in. hav- 
ing the invalid restored to health, her tender little 
heart shrank from the pain and suffering that must 
be endured.
