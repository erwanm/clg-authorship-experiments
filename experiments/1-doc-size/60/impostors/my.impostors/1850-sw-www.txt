And away they went. Ellen drew two or three sighs at 
first, but she could not help brightening up soon. It was 
early — not sunrise ; the cool freshness of the air was enough 
to give one new life and spirit ; the sky was fair and bright ; 
and Mr. Van Brunt marched along at a quick pace. En- 
livened by the exercise, Ellen speedily forgot everything 
disagreeable ; and her little head was rilled with pleasant 
fellings. She watched where the silver light in the east foretold the sur's coming. She watched the silver change to 







gold, till a rich yellow tint was flung over the whole land- 
scape ; and then broke the first rays of light upon the tops 
of the western hills, — the sun was up. It was a new sight 
to Ellen. 

" How beautiful ! 0, how beautiful !" she exclaimed. 

" Yes," said Mr. Van Brunt, in his slow way, " it'll be a 
fine day for the field. I guess I'll go with the oxen over to 
that 'ere big meadow." 

"Just look," said Ellen, "how the light comes creeping 
down the side of the mountain, — now it has got to the wood, 
— 0, do look at the tops of the trees ! O ! I wish mamma 
was here." 

Mr. Van Brunt didn't know what to say to this. He 
rather wished so too, for her sake. 

"There," said Ellen, "now the sunshine is on the fence, 
and the road, and everything. I wonder what is the reason 
that the sun shines first upon the top of the mountain, and 
then comes so slowly down the side ; why don't it shine on 
the whole at once ?" 

Mr. Van Brunt shook his head in ignorance. " He guessed 
it always did so," he said. 

"Yes," said Ellen, " I suppose it does, but that's the very 
thing, — I want to know the reason why. And I noticed just 
now, it shone in my face before it touched my hands. Isn't 
it queer ?" 

" Humph ! — there's a great many queer things, if you 
come to that," said Mr. Van Brunt, philosophically. 

But Ellen's head ran on from one thing to another, and 
her next question was not so wide of the subject as her companion might have thought. 

" Mr. Van Brunt, are there any schools about here ?" 

"Schools?" said the person addressed, "yes — there's 
plenty of schools."
