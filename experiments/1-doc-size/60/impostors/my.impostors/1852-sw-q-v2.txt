"You had better ask me what I have come for," he said,
laughing, as he shook hands with her.

"What have you come for?"

"To carry you home."

"Home?" said Fleda.

"I am going up there for a day or two, and mamma wrote me I
had better act as your escort, which, of course, I am most
willing to do. See what mamma says to you."

"When are you going, Charlton?" said Fleda, as she broke the
seal of the note he gave her.

"To-morrow morning."

"That is too sudden a notice, Captain Rossitur," said Mrs.
Evelyn. "Fleda will hurry herself out of her colour, and then

your coming home if it were for your good to stay; but I fancy
from something in Mrs. Evelyn's letter, that Queechy air will
by this time do you good again; and opportunities of making
the journey are very uncertain. My heart has grown lighter
since I gave it leave to expect you.  Yours, my darling,


R.


"P. S.  I will write to Mrs. E. soon."


"What string has pulled these wires that are twitching me
home?" thought Fleda, as her eyes went over and over the words
which the feeling of the lines of her face would alone have
told her were unwelcome. And why unwelcome?  "One likes to be
moved by fair means and not by foul," was the immediate
