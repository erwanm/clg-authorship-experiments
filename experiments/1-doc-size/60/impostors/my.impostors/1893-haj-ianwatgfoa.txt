"I thought so," answered Fletcher, crestfallen.

"I thought you knew it. Why, this is a contemptibly small sum, and
doesn't pay for our trouble."

"You're right, squire," said Obed. "It aint worth carryin' away. You may

"Most certainly I am. If you had had a large sum in money, we would have
spared you this. As it is, we must have them."

"But we shall starve, without money or food."

"That is nothing to me."

"Well, boys, come along," said Obed in a despondent tone. "Our prospects
