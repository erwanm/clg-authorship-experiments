“Don Antonio Valdes took despatches from the 
governor to the King to remind him of the pledge that 
had been given that new colonists should not be molested, 
provided there was no other recognized mode of public 
w'orship, and that it was his, the King’s, wish that emi- 
gration should be encouraged. The mere fact of an 
officer of the Inquisition being in the province would 
drive people at once to the shelter of the Americans, who 
were growing more powerful every day. And he also 
informed the King that Don Andreas Almonaster had 
laid the foundation of the new Cathedral that would be 
a glory to the province, and that the population was 
largely loyal Catholics.” 

“And is it really true that we — that no one besides your 
Church is allowed to worship publicly?” asked Madame 
Champe, with a protest in her voice. 

The hostess smiled with an expressive gesture. 

“There are many people coming and going all the time 
who are not Catholics, and you will find people of your 
own faith. They no doubt have their services. But the 
horrible Inquisition — no, we could not stand that ! We 
are not all Spanish yet,” with a doubtful, musical laugh. 

Claire and Angelique had made quite a friendship. 
There were various places of entertainment. There was 
a theatre; only young girls were not allowed to see all 
the plays. And there was walking along the levees and 
driving out to the lakes, where many had summer houses 
and plantations and boats, and went sailing where it was 
most delicious. And visiting parties — where they danced 
and played games. 

But Barbe gave the signal for their departure, after 
expressing much pleasure and gratitude for the friend- 
liness. 





Two slaves with lanterns were despatched to see them 
safely home. But there was such a magnificent moon 
that it was almost like day. 

‘T shall never want to go back to France/’ declared 
Angelique, with enthusiasm. 


CHAPTER VII. 

A TASTE OF SOCIETY. 

Sylvie begged to go over with them the next day. 
Yes, she would play with Felice, even if she was such a 
baby, and could not talk straight.
