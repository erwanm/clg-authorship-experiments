or two, when the young fellow found it too severe 
a pull ; others who would have been fortunate if a 



 

brutal and indolent husband had left them to do for 
themselves. Twice in those early years I had been 
almost tempted, but the hostages to fortune came 
too high. No doubt, the family system is the struc 
tural unit of society. It has helped men to possess 
and conquer the earth. The boarding-houses provide 
none of the restraints or incentives of home. But 
the labor system of the present day makes marriages 
almost an impossibility. No one is educated for 
home life. Girls of fourteen take their places in 
shops, stores, and offices. To them the day is 
rounded by the evening's amusement, and they long 
for the excitement. Quiet life is too humdrum. 
The irregularity of employment is a fatal discour 
agement. The swift fingers of machinery soon piles 
up a store of goods, then ensues a dull season. The 
man looks his starving family in the face, and in 
wardly curses the brief affection that made him 
dream they would be a delight. Deserted wives 
are to be met with everywhere ; and many husbands, 
when they first set out in search of work, have no 
intention of making the separation final. But labor 
is simply a commodity, and does not recognize wife 
or husband, parent or child. The cheapest labor is 
the continual cry. 

And now a change was impending for us. Hence 
forward Eve must be my care. 



We talked about it all the evening. She was 
pleased that aunt Carry had written so cordially, 
and approved Kate's marriage. There was also an 
invitation for her to come down to Long Branch. 

Whatever happened, we would keep together. 
We had managed to save up a little money this sum 
mer. I was the happy possessor of about three hun 
dred dollars ; and Eve had that sum left from her 
portion, and a piano. She did not incline to New 
York, neither did she wish to go very far away from 
it. There were so many contractions at this season 
of the year. 

I heard of a place in Florida, and one in Indiana. 

"Why, we might go to Florida, and have an 
orange-grove. I believe I have inherited father's 
taste for the country. In the course of time, you 
might give up telegraphing." 

I laughed at that.
