from the threshold of the court. “Have you seen Miss Prodmore? If you
haven’t, find her!”

Mrs. Gracedew addressed their visitor in a very different tone, though
with the full authority of her benevolence. “You won’t, my dear
man.” To Mr. Prodmore also she continued bland. “I happen to know
she has gone for a walk.”

“A walk--alone?” Mr. Prodmore gasped.

“No--not alone.” Mrs. Gracedew looked at Chivers with a vague
smile of appeal for help, but he could only give her, from under his
bent old brow, the blank decency of his wonder. It seemed to make her
feel afresh that she was, after all, alone--so that in her loneliness,
which had also its fine sad charm, she risked another brush with their
formidable friend. “Cora has gone with Mr. Pegg.”

“Pegg has been here?”

It was like a splash in a full basin, but she launched the whole
craft. “He walked with her from the station.”

“When she arrived?” Mr. Prodmore rose like outraged Neptune.
“That’s why she was so late?”

Mrs. Gracedew assented. “Why I got here first. I get everywhere

intrigue?”

She had something in her face now that was indifferent to any
violence. “You’re too disappointed to see your real interest:
oughtn’t I therefore in common charity to point it out to you?”

He faced her question so far as to treat it as one. “What do you
know of my disappointment?”

There was something in his very harshness that even helped her, for it
added at this moment to her sense of making out in his narrowed glare a
couple of tears of rage. “I know everything.”

“What do you know of my real interest?” he went on as if he had not
heard her.

“I know enough for my purpose--which is to offer you a handsome
condition. I think it’s not I who have protected the happy
understanding that you call by so ugly a name; it’s the happy
understanding that has put me”--she gained confidence--“well, in a
