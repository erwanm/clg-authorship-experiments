protests or remonstrances or accusations, nor to the 
world was there any change in the daily life of 
these two. 

It was more pitiful even than that. Here was a 
woman who had set her heart in all the passionate 
love of a pure ideal, and day by day she felt that 
the world, the frivolous world, with its low and 
selfish aims, was too strong for her, and that the 
stream was wrecking her life because it was bear- 





ing Jack away from her. What could one woman 
do against the accepted demoralizations of her so- 
cial life ? To go with them, not to care, to accept 
Jack's idle, good - natured, easy philosophy of life 
and conduct, would not that have insured a peace- 
ful life? Why shouldn't she conform and float, 
and not mind ? 

To be sure, a wise woman, who has been blessed 
or cursed with a long experience of life, would have 
known that such a course could not forever, or for 
long, secure happiness, and that a man's love ulti- 
mately must rest upon a profound respect for his 
wife and a belief in her nobility. Perhaps Edith 
did not reason in this way. Probably it was her 
instinct for what was pure and true showing, in- 
deed, the quality of her love that guided her. 

To Jack's friends he was much the same as usual. 
He simply went on in his ante -marriage ways. 
Perhaps he drank a little more, perhaps he was a 
little more reckless at cards, and it was certain that 
his taste for amusing himself in second-hand book- 
shops and antiquity collections had weakened. 
His talked-of project for some regular occupation 
seemed to have been postponed, although he said 
to himself that it was only postponed until his 
speculations, which kept him in a perpetual fever, 
should put him in a position to command a busi- 



Meantime he did not neglect social life that is, 





the easy, tolerant company which lived as he liked 
to live. There was at first some pretence of declin- 
ing invitations which Edith could not accept, but 
he soon fell into the habit of a man whose family 
has temporarily gone abroad, with the privileges 
of a married man, without the responsibilities of a 
bachelor. Edith could see that he took great credit
