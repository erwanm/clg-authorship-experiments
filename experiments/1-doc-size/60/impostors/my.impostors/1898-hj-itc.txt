else, count words as numberless as the sands 
of the sea, the words of the telegrams thrust, 
from morning to night, through the gap left 
in the high lattice, across the encumbered 
shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing. 
This transparent screen fenced out or fenced 
in, according to the side of the narrow 
counter on which the human lot was cast, the 
duskiest corner of a shop pervaded not a lit 
tle, in winter, by the poison of perpetual gas 
and at all times by the presence of hams, 
cheese, dried fish, soap, varnish, paraffin and 
other solids and fluids that she came to know 
perfectly by their smells without consenting 
to know them by their names. 

The barrier that divided the little post- 
and-telegraph-office from the grocery was a 
frail structure of wood and wire; but the

recognised the others the less because she 
had at last so unreservedly, so irredeemably 
recognised Mr. Mudge. But she was a little 
ashamed, none the less, of having to admit 
to herself that Mr. Mudge 's removal to a 
higher sphere to a more commanding position, 
that is, though to a much lower neighborhood 
would have been described still 
better as a luxury than as the simplification 
that she contented herself with calling it. 
He had, at any rate, ceased to be all day 
long in her eyes, and this left something a 
little fresh for them to rest on of a Sunday. 
During the three months that he had 
remained at Cocker 's after her consent to 
their engagement, she had often asked her 
self what it was that marriage would be able
