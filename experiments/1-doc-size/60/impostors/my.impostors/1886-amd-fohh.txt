Louise pouts and coaxes, but in vain. 

He stands several moments in the crisp night air, then 
he turns in an opposite direction and walks rapidly, with- 
out thinking of his mother. Stirling House is all alight ; it 
is not Westwater fashion to shroud every casement as soon 
as lamps are lighted. The court-yards or lawns in front 
shield the guests and household from curious or too near 
glances. 

Trevenna steals softly up the path. The lace draperies 
give a lovely soft suggestiveness to the interior. There 
are pictures and bronzes, the portieres are drawn aside, and 
the three rooms present delightful vistas. There is a pro- 
fusion of flowers, the furniture is elegant, the carpet soft 
as moss, and silken gowns go trailing over it. Agatha is 
in white silk, with fine Indian mull draperies and lace, and 
one superb scarlet cactus bloom, low down in her shining 
hair, and two others at her belt. She always has some 



 



 



 

distinguislimg mark ; she is a little different from othei 
women. Yes, she is regal ; this is the setting that suits 
her, the only setting for her. He has been mad to dream, 
but he will be mad no more. It is all over. He cannot 
blame her for choosing the life she needs, any more than 
one would blame a child for sitting in the royal sunshine. 
And yet that dream has changed his life ; bent it from the 
first pure ideal. 

They all have a relieved feeling that Trevenna takes the 
engagement sensibly. His mother can only guess at the 
deep hurt. He mentions it carelessly on Sunday ; he walks 
over to call on the Wentworth household, who give him 
their olden welcome ; and he takes Agatha's hand, on which 
shines a diamond that might grace a queen. 

Mrs. Wentworth watches the greeting, and is satisfied. 
Of course, Agatha could be relied upon to understand 
her own mind and desires. And now Graham must set- 
tle himself to some position or profession and make his 
own fortune, while Basil will take up his burden of life 
proudly enough when the time comes. Yet the mother's 
heart aches at the thought of her first-born despoiled of 
his heritage. She and Louise can manage ; under Mrs. 
Stirling's favoring auspices, Louise will no doubt marry 
well. Of Olive, no one expects anything. 

Christmas is always a gay season at Westwater.
