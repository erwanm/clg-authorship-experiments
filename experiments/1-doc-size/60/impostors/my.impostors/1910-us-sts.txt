fested with vermin. 

The discovery sent him bounding to the mid- 
dle of the floor. It set him wild with rage. Such 
a thing had never happened to him in his life be- 





fore, for his home was a decent and clean one. 
This was the crowning infamy — that they should 
have taken him, helpless as he was, and shut him 
up in a filthy hole to be devoured by bedbugs and 
lice. 

In the morning they brought him bread and 
coffee ; and after a couple of hours' more waiting 
he was taken to court. 

It was a big bare room with whitewashed walls. 
There were a few scattered spectators, a couple 
of policemen and several men writing at tables. 
Seated within an inclosure were a number of 
prisoners, dull and listless looking. One by one 
they stepped up before the railing and faced the 
judge ; there would be a few muttered words and 
they would move on. Everything went as a mat- 
ter of routine, which had been going that way for 
ages. The judge, who was elderly and gray 
haired, looked like a prosperous business man in 
a masquerade costume. 

Samuel's turn came and he stood before the 
bar. His name was read, and the charge — 
vagrancy. 

" Well? " said the judge mechanically. 
" What have you to say for yourself? " 

Samuel caught his breath. " It's not my fault, 
sir," he began. 

" Your honor," prompted the policeman who 
stood at his elbow. 





" Your honor," said Samuel, " I lost all my 
money. And I've been trying to find work, yoiur 
honor." 

" Have you any friends in town? " 

" No, your honor." 

" How long have you been here? "
