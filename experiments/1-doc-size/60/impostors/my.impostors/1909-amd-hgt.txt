cordially. 

Mr. Hildreth declared presently that he 
must return home. 


“No, you must stay and have a cup of tea 
with us,” said Mrs. Stirling persuasively. “ It 
has been so long since you have dropped in to 
tea.” 

“ I do not think I will need much coaxing. 
I sometimes tire of my own solitary meals 
when I have no guests.” 

Then they discussed neighborhood matters 
and the coming Christmas, church festivities, 
Christmas trees, and the new proprietor of the 
paper mill who was putting in up-to-date ma- 
chinery, and who had purchased the old Craw- 
ford house and was having that put in order. 

“ There are five or six children,” he said, 
“ some quite large, and they may be a new 
trial for you, Miss Grant,” with a rather hu- 
morous expression. 

Helen noticed that he made no reference to 
the Thanksgiving visit. Did she quite like 
having secrets with him? Yet she liked him 
very much. 


CHAPTER X 


SOWING BESIDE ALL WAYS 

Helen overruled Lilian Firth’s objections 
and she was ready to accompany her on the 
skating expedition. Helen felt she had been a 
little rash in promising, but the splendid ex- 
ercise had tempted her. 

“ Do you suppose there will be any other 
venturesome people out?” she asked of Allen. 

“ Oh, lots of them. And Mr. Hildreth said 
to skate along the edge soon after we passed 
the first bridge. It will shorten the walk a 
good deal.” 

They picked their way down. The going 
was rather rough. Here was where she had 
crossed over the day she felt so lonesome and 
tired, and had run away and met with an ad- 
venture. She laughed softly to herself. But 
her sympathies went warmly out to the boy 
with a little limp, who trudged along buoy- 
antly.
