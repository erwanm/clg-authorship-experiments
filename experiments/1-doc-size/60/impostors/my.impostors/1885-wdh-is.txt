They quitted the bridge, and turning to the left, 
moved down the street which with difficulty finds 



 

space between the parapet of the river and the shops 
of the mosaicists and dealers in statuary cramping it 
on the other hand. 

" Here 's something distinctively Florentine too," 
said Colville. " These table-tops, and paper-weights, 
and caskets, and photograph frames, and lockets, and 
breast-pins ; and here, this ghostly glare of under- 
sized Psyches and Hebes and Graces in alabaster." 

" Oh, you mustn't think of any of them !" Mrs. 
Bowen broke in with horror. " If your friend wishes 
you to get her something characteristically Flor- 
entine, and at the same time very tasteful, you must

Colville gave a melancholy laugh. " My friend is 
an abstraction, Mrs. Bowen, without sex or any sort

and caught her draperies from the ground for the 
next movement. " Mr. Colville, will you please stop

and at a nod from Colville he drove abreast of the 
doorway, his broken-kneed, tremulous little horse 



 

gay in brass-mounted harness, and with a stiff turkey 
feather stuck upright at one ear in his head-stall. 

Mrs. Bowen had no more scruple than another 
woman in stopping travel and traffic in a public 
sireet for her convenience. She now entered into a 
brisk parting conversation with Colville, such as 
ladies love, blocking the narrow sidesvalk with her- 
self, her daughter, and her open carriage door, and 
making people walk round her cab, in the road, 
which they did meekly enough, with the Florentine 
submissiveness to the pretensions of any sort of
