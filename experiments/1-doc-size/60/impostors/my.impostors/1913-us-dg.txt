The doctor laughed, contemptuously. 
"You were told, you were told! I'll 
wager that you know the laws of the 
Chinese concerning party-walls." 

"Yes, naturally' said George. "But I 
don't see what they have to do with it." 

"Instead of teaching you such things' 
was the reply, "it would have been a 
great deal better to have taught you 
about the nature and cause of diseases of 
this sort. Then you would have known 
how to avoid the contagion. Such knowl- 
edge should be spread abroad, for it is the 
most important knowledge in the world. 
It should be found in every newspaper." 

This remark gave George something of a 
shock, for his father had owned a little 
paper in the provinces, and he had a 
sudden vision of the way subscribers would 
have fallen off, if he had printed even so 
much as the name of this vile disease. 

"And yet," pursued the doctor, "you 
pubHsh romances about adultery!" 

"Yes' said George, "that's what the 
readers want." 

"They don't want the truth about vene- 



 

real diseases," exclaimed the other. ''If 
they knew the full truth, they would no 
longer think that adultery was romantic 
and interesting." 

He went on to give his advice as to the 
means of avoiding such diseases. There 
was really but one rule. It was: To love 
but one woman, to take her as a virgin, 
and to love her so much that she would 
never deceive you. "Take that from me," 
added the doctor, "and teach it to your 
son, when you have one." 

George's attention was caught by this 
last sentence. 

"You mean that I shall be able to have 
children?" he cried. 

"Certainly," was the reply. 

"Healthy children?"
