that time to find out if you are among the 
number of those unfortunate ones whom I 
pity with all my heart, for whom the 
disease is without mercy; because during 
that time you will be dangerous to your 
wife and to your children. The children 
I have not yet mentioned to you.' 

Here the doctor's voice trembled slightly. 
He spoke with moving eloquence. ''Come, 
sir, you are an honest man; you are too 
young for such things not to move you; 
you are not insensible to duty. It is 
impossible that I shan't be able to find a 
way to your heart, that I shan't be able to 
make you obey me. My emotion in speak- 
ing to you proves that I appreciate your 
suffering, that I suffer with you. It is in 
the name of my sincerity that I implore 
you. You have admitted it — that you 
have not the right to expose your wife to 



 

such miseries. But it is not only your wife 
that you strike; you may attack in her 
your own children. I exclude you for a 
moment from my thought — you and her. 
It is in the name of these innocents that I 
implore you; it is the future, it is the race 
that I defend. Listen to me, listen to me! 
Out of the twenty households of which I 
spoke, only fifteen had children; these 
fifteen had twenty-eight. Do you know 
how many out of these twenty-eight sur-

derer of children. Herod reigns in France, 
and over all the earth, and begins each 
year his massacre of the innocents; and 
if it be not blasphemy against the sacred- 
ness of life, I say that the most happy are 
those who have disappeared. Visit our 
children's hospitals! We know too well 
the child of syphilitic parents; the type is 
classical; the doctors can pick it out any- 
where. Those httle old creatures who 
have the appearance of having already 
lived, and who have kept the stigmata of 
all our infirmities, of all our decay. They 



 

are the victims of fathers who have mar- 
ried, being ignorant of what you know — 
things which I should like to go and cry
