" Please don't say these things," she answered. 

"Do you hate me?" 

" Oh no," said Catherine. 

Something in her tone discouraged him, but in 
a moment he recovered himself. " Have you still 
some kindness for me, then 3" 





" I don't know why you have come here to ask 
me such things !" Catherine exclaimed. 

" Because for many years it has been the desire 
of my life that we should be friends again." 

" That is impossible." 

" Why so ? Not if you will allow it." 

" I will not allow it," said Catherine. 

He looked at her again in silence. " I see ; my 
presence troubles you and pains you. I will go 
away ; but you must give me leave to come again." 

" Please don't come again," she said. 

" Never ? never ?" 

She made a great effort ; she wished to say some- 
thing that would make it impossible he should ever 
again cross her threshold. " It is wrong of you. 
There is no propriety in it no reason for it." 

"Ah, dearest lady, you do me injustice !" cried 
Morris Townsend. " We have only waited, and now 
we are free." 

" You treated me badly," said Catherine. 

" Not if you think of it rightly. You had your 
quiet life with your father which was just what I 
could not make up my mind to rob you of." 

"Yes; I had that." 

Morris felt it to be a considerable damage to his 
cause that he could not add that she had had some- 
thing more besides ; for it is needless to say that he 
had learned the contents of Doctor Sloper's will. He 
was, nevertheless, not at a loss. " There are worse 
fates than that !" he exclaimed, with expression ; and 
he might have been supposed to refer to his own 
unprotected situation. Then he added, with a deeper 
tenderness, " Catherine, have you never forgiven me ?"
