" Plague on that Sambo, to kick up this yer row 
between me and the new hands ! The fellow won't be 
fit to work for a week now right in the press of the 
season ! " 

" Yes, just like you," said a voice behind his chair. It 
was the woman Gassy, who had stolen upon his soliloquy. 

" Ha ! you she-devil ! you've come back, have you ?" 

" Yes, I have," she said coolly ; " come to have my own 
way, too!" 

" You lie, you jade ! I'll be up to my word. Either
