He was listening with a good-humoured, negligent air, half 
comic, half contemptuous, to Haley, who was very volubly 
expatiating on the quality of the article for which they were 
bargaining. 

" All the moral and Christian virtues bound in black 
morocco, complete ! " he said, when Haley had finished. 





" Well, now, my good fellow, what's the damage ? as they 
say in Kentucky ; in short what's to be paid out for this 
business ? How much are you going to cheat me, now ? 
Out with it!" 

" Wai," said Haley, " if I should say thirteen hundred 
dollars for that ar fellow, I shouldn't but just save myself I 
shouldn't, now, re'ly." 

" Poor fellow ! " said the young man, fixing his keen, 
mocking blue eye on him ; " but I suppose you would let me 
have him for that, out of a particular regard for me ? " 

" Well, the young lady here seems to be sot on him, and 
nat'lly enough." 

" Oh, certainly, there's a call on your benevolence, my 
friend. Now, as a matter of Christian charity, how cheap 
could you afford to let him go, to oblige a young lady that's 
particular sot on him ? " 

" Wai, now, just think on't," said the trader ; " just look 
at them limbs broad-chested, strong as a horse. Look at 
his head ; them high forrads al'ays shows calculatin' niggers, 
that'll do any kind o' thing. I've marked that ar. Now, a 
nigger of that ar heft and build is worth considerable, just, 
as you may say, for his body, supposin' he's stupid : but 
come to put in his calculatin' faculties, and them which I 
can show he has oncommon, why, of course, it makes him 
come higher. Why, that ar fellow managed his master's 
whole farm. He has a strornary talent for business." 

" Bad, bad, very bad ; knows altogether too much ! " said 
the young man, with the same mocking smile playing about 
his mouth. " Never will do in the world. Tour smart 
fellows are always running off, stealing horses, and raising 
the devil generally. I think you'll haye to take off a couple 
of hundred for his smartness." 

" Wai, there might be something in that ar, if it warn't 
for his character; but I can show recommends from his 
master and others, to prove he is one of your real pious the 
most humble, pray in', pious critter ye ever did see. Why, 
he's been called a preacher in them parts he came from." 

"And I might use him for a family chaplain, possibly," 
added the young man, dryly. " That's quite an idea. Religion is a remarkably scarce article at our house."
