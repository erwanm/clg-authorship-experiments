as having cast him off. If this were the case, it would 



 

perhaps be well for Mrs. Luna still to hold on. Basil's 
induction was very rapid, but it gave him time to decide 
that the best thing to say to his interlocutress was : ' On 
what day do you sail for Europe?' 

' Perhaps I shall not sail at all,' Mrs. Luna replied, 
looking out of the window. 

'And in that case poor Newton's education?' 

'  I should try to content myself with a country which 
has given you yours.' 

' Don't you want him, then, to be a man of the world?' 

'Ah, the world, the world!' she murmured, while she 
watched, in the deepening dusk, the lights of the town 
begin to reflect themselves in the Back Bay. 'Has it 
been such a source of happiness to me that I belong to it ? ' 

' Perhaps, after all, I shall be able to go to Florence ! ' 
said Ransom, laughing. 

She faced him once more, this time slowly, and declared 
that she had never known anything so strange as his state 
of mind she would be so glad to have an explanation of 
it. With the opinions he professed (it was for them she 
had liked him she didn't like his character), why on earth 
should he be running after a little fifth-rate poseuse, and in 
such a frenzy to get hold of her? He might say it was 
none of her business, and of course she would have no 
answer to that; therefore she admitted that she asked 
simply out of intellectual curiosity, and because one always 
was tormented at the sight of a painful contradiction. With 
the things she had heard him say about his convictions and 
theories, his view of life and the great questions of the 
future, she should have thought he would find Miss Tarrant's 
attitudinising absolutely nauseous. Were not her views the 
same as Olive's, and hadn't Olive and he signally failed to 
hit it off together? Mrs. Luna only asked because she was 
really quite puzzled. ' Don't you know that some minds, 
when they see a mystery, can't rest till they clear it up?' 

'  You can't be more puzzled than I am,' said Ransom. 
'Apparently the explanation is to be found in a sort of 
reversal of the formula you were so good, just now, as to 
apply to me. You like my opinions, but you entertain a 
different sentiment for my character. I deplore Miss 



 

Tarrant's opinions, but her character well, her character
