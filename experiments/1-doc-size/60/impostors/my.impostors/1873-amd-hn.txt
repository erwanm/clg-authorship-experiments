"My dear, you are very silent," said aunt Waltham, 
dryly. 

Eleanor flushed deeply. 

" I think aunt " she began, falteringly, " that I ought 
to stay at home " 

" Nonsense, Eleanor ! " with some asperity. u What 
good can you do ? Madge and Jessie are sufficient for the 
housework, and your father surely, does not need more 
than one nurse. With Philip's salary, every one counts. 
So, do not be foolish." 

It seemed curious to Eleanor, in her after-life, that she 
took this sharp retort so meekly. Her mental forces were 
very evenly balanced, and a feather's weight one way or 
the other decided the case. 

Aunt Waltham gained it, of course. She set forth elo-

She leaned over and kissed Eleanor tenderly. 

"Mamma was quite willing? " she asked. 

" Of course. And your father favors it. He feels keenly 
the misfortune he has brought upon you all." 

"O, auntl don't;" and Eleanor's face paled with help-

" Yes, you might as well have had something ! Doesn't 
even the Bible recommend that one make friends of the 
mammon of unrighteousness ? It sounds very pretty to 
despise money, but we shall hardly be able to do without 
it before the millennium comes." 

Then Mrs. Waltham changed her tone, thinking that 
she had flavored her speech sufficiently. The tenderness 
was very hard for Eleanor to resist. 

She dilated glowingly on her plans for the summer. A 
friend, whose husband was absent in Europe, had begged 
her to spend three months at least with her at Newport, 
where Mr. Gifford owned an elegant little nest. And if 
they could find some agreeable young lady 

She understood just what pretty and foolish Mrs. Gifford
