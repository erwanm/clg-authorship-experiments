thing strangely sweet, yet awesome, in the smile, a flutter 
hovering in the faint, wandering tones. 

Madge kept flowers in her room, and brought her many 
delicacies. She did not think it tiresome to listen or to 
talk, though the subject might be simple and the ideas 
vague or unformed. 

" What is it ? " she asked, one evening, as the wistful eyes 
followed her about, an unexpressed longing in their depth. 

" I hate to have you go, Miss Ashburton. You never 
staid here all night did you ? "

poor Mary a good deal of trouble, longing for things that 
I could not have. She didn't want Mr. Maurice to come,
