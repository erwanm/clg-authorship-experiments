She had made many master-strokes, but this was the 
master-stroke. It was an appeal to Rome. It was her clear 
right ; and if she had persisted in it Cauchon's plot would 
have tumbled about his ears like a house of cards, and he 
would have gone from that place the worst beaten man of 
the century. He was daring, but he was not daring 
enough to stand up against that demand if Joan had urged 
it. But no, she was ignorant, poor thing, and did not 
know what a blow she had struck for life and liberty. 

France was not the Church. Rome had no interest in 
the destruction of this messenger of God. Rome would 
have given her a fair trial, and that was all that her cause 
needed. From that trial she would have gone forth free 
and honoured and blest. 

But it was not so fated. Cauchon at once diverted the 
questions to other matters and hurried the trial quickly to 
an end. 

As Joan moved feebly away, dragging her chains, I felt 
stunned and dazed, and kept saying to myself, ' Such a 
little while ago she said the saving word and could have 
gone free ; and now, there she goes to her death ; yes, it 
is to her death ; I know it, I feel it. They will double the 
guards ; they will never let any come near her now between 
this and her condemnation, lest she get a hint and speak 
that word again. This is the bitterest day that has come 
to me in all this miserable time.' 



CHAPTER XIII 

So the second trial in the prison was over. Over, and no 
definite result. The character of it I have described to 
you. It was baser in one particular than the previous one ; 
for this time the charges had not been communicated to 
Joan, therefore she had been obliged to fight in the dark. 
There was no opportunity to do any thinking beforehand ; 
there was no foreseeing what traps might be set, and no way 
to prepare for them. Truly it was a shabby advantage to 
take of a girl situated as this one was. One day, during 
the course of it, an able lawyer of Normandy, Maitre Lohier, 
happened to be in Rouen, and I will give you his opinion 
of that trial, so that you may see that I have been honest 
with you, and that my partisanship has not made me de- 
ceive you as to its unfair and illegal character. Cauchon 
showed Lohier the proces and asked his opinion about the 
trial. Now this was the opinion which he gave to Cauchon. 
He said that the whole thing was null and void ; for these 
reasons : (i) Because the trial was secret, and full free- 
dom of speech and action on the part of those present not 
possible ; (2) Because the trial touched the honour of the 
King of France, yet he was not summoned to defend him- 
self, nor any one appointed to represent him ; (3) Because 



the charges against the prisoner were not communicated
