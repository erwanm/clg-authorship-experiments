drapery displaying the lovely roundness of the dimpled 
limbs. There were mothers of little girls looking on, 
fathers, brothers, yet to them she was only a thing for 
their amusement ; not a casket wherein was shrined a 
woman's soul, a soul capable of sweetness, affection, truth, 
and purity, or a dangerous power in after years to strike 
back home, to draw into her bewildering, delusive net, 
husbands, brothers, sons ; to pay in tears and anguish the 
plaudits of to-night, and all nights to come. 

Her starry beauty enchanted. There was a breathless 
hush through the audience. She felt these merciless, 





staring eyes, and her cheeks became the color of scarlet 
poppies, her small mouth quivered, the rosy lips parting, 
and her eyes blazed in the glare of light ; nay, her very

soul. 

The performance began. The athlete's light sinuous 
curves, that brought out the quiver of playing muscles, now 
a long, lithe band just under the skin, now a ball of hard, 
knotted cord, holding himself by the tip of a finger, by the 
strength of an ankle, by the chin, vaulting, springing from 
height to height like a monkey in its native wilds, hanging 
head downward, with his arms crossed on his magnificent 
chest, as superbly indifferent as if he were lounging on a 
sofa, while rounds of applause sounded from pit to dome. 

AridTitania!
