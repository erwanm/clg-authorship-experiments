"She moved in less than a month after you went 
away." 

" Couldn't pay her rent, ha ! " 

" Yes ; she paid it as long as she stayed. I have not 
seen or heard anything of her since." 

" I have," said the mate, significantly. 

" You I " exclaimed Peter, eagerly. 

" I saw her to-day." 

"How — where?" 

 




" In a carriage." 

" A carriage ! " echoed Peter, in surprise. 

" Yes ; looking as bright and handsome as when she 
rejected you with scorn." 

The miser frowned. 

" Where did you meet her? " 

"On Washington Street. I was walking there when 
I chanced to look into a gay carriage that was driving 
by, and saw her." . 

" Are you sure you are nqt mistaken? " 

" No, I followed her to her place of residence." 

"Where is it?" 

« No. Mt. Vernon Street." 

" She must bs rich, then." 

" No ; she is a governess there, though enjoying, I 
should think, unusual privileges, and is, no doubt,  
happy." 

Peter made no reply, but seemed occupied by other 
thoughts. 

" And now, Peter, have you any idea what I came 
for?" 

" To tell me this." 

" I am not fool enough to take all this trouble."
