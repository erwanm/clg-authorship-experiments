already beginning to bear fruit. Few of them but 
have that most dismal of all fireside ornaments, a 
half-effaced old-maid sister, one of the most tragic 
and pitiable objects in France. The noble attributes 
which her drab and eventless life sometimes leave unwithered were superbly demonstrated to the American 
audience some years ago by Nance O'Neil in "The 
Lily." 



One of the new officers I happened to hear of was a 
farmer who not only won the Croix de Guerre and the 
Croix de la Legion d'Honneur very early in the war 
but rose in rank until, when I heard the story, he was 
a major. One day a brother officer asked him if he 



 

should remain in the army after peace was declared. 

"No," he replied, and it was evident that he had 
thought the matter over. "My wife is not a lady. She 
is wholly unfitted to take her place in the officers' class. 
There is no democracy among women. Better for us 
both that I return whence I came." 

This is a fair sample of the average Frenchman's 
ironic astuteness, that clear practical vision that sees 
life without illusions. But if the war should drag on 
for years the question is, would he be willing to surrender the position of authority to which he had grown 
accustomed, and which satisfies the deepest instincts 
of a man's nature after youth has passed ? After all 
there may be a new "officers' class." 

I heard another story, told me by a family doctor, 
equally interesting. The son of a wealthy and aristocratic house and his valet were mobilized at the same 
time. The young patrician was a good and a gallant 
soldier but nothing more. The valet discovered extraordinary capacities. Not only did he win the cov- 
eted medals in the course of the first few months, but 
when his shattered regiment under fire in the open 
was deprived of its officers he took command and led 
the remnant to victory. A few more similar performances proving that his usefulness was by no 
means the result of the moment's exaltation but of 
real however unsuspected gifts, he was rapidly promoted until he was captain of his former employer's 
company. There appears to have been no mean envy 
in the nature of the less fortunate aristocrat. Several times they have received their permission together and he has taken his old servant home with 
him and given him the seat of honor at his own 
table. His mother and sisters have made no demur 
whatever, but are proud that their menage should have 
given a fine soldier to France. Perhaps only the noblesse who are unalterably sure of themselves would 
have been capable of rising above the age-old prejudices of caste, war or no war.

French women rarely emigrate. Never, if they can 
help it. Our servant question may be solved after the 
war by the manless women of other races, but the 
Frenchwoman will stay in her country, if possible in
