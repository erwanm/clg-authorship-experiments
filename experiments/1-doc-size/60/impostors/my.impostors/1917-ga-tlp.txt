to his liking; also the list of guests, if it had been 
thought well to vary their charming routine with a 
select company. 

Before his wife bought a new gown she submitted 
the style and colors to what seems literally to have 
been her other half, and he solemnly pondered over 
both before pronouncing his august and final opinion. 

If they had children, the interest was naturally extended. His concern in health and in illness, in play 
and in study, was nothing short of meticulous. I 
asked my informant if Frenchwomen would ever again 
submit to a man's making such an infernal nuisance 
of himself, and, sad as she still was at her own- 
great loss, she replied positively that they would not. 
They had tasted independence and liked it too well 
ever to drop back into insignificance. 

"Nor," she added, "will we be content with rflerely 
social and domestic life in the future. We will love 
our home life none the less, but we must always work 
at something now; only those who have lost their 
health, or are natural parasites will ever again be 
content to live without some vital personal interest 
outside the family." 

Words of tremendous import to France, those. 



 

VII 

I caught a glimpse more than once of the complete 
submergence of certain Frenchwomen by husbands 
too old for war, but important in matters of State. 
They bored me so that I only escaped betraying acute 
misery by summoning all my powers of resistance and 
talking against time until I could make a graceful 
exit. They were, these women (who looked quite 
happy), mere echoes of the men to whom their eyes 
wandered in admiration and awe. The last thing I 
had imagined, however, was that the men would concern themselves about details that, in Anglo-Saxon 
countries at least, have for centuries been firmly relegated to the partner of the second part. How many American women drive their husbands to the club by 
their incessant drone about the iniquities of servants 
and the idiosyncrasies of offspring? 

And much as the women of our race may resent 
that their role in matrimony is the one of petty detail, 
while the man enjoys the "broader interests," I think 
few of us would exchange our lot for one of constant niggling interference. It induces a certain pleasure to reflect that so many Frenchwomen have reformed. Frenchmen, with all their conservatism, are 
the quickest of wit, the most supple of intellect in 
the world. No doubt after a few birth-pains they 
will conform, and enjoy life more than ever. Perhaps, also, they will cease to prowl abroad for secret 
entertainment.
