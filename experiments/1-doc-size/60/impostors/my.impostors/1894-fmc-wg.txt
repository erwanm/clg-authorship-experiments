shelf, and sat for an hour gazing at Nina's face, while he racked his
ingenuity for some new invention by which to hide even the smallest
trace of the terrible accident.

She was wonderfully mended. Even he was obliged to admit that; but the
scar was still visible to his keen eyes, a very fine line right across
the face, downwards from right to left. Yet all the conditions had been
most favourable for a cure, since the cement had set quite hard at the
first attempt and the weather had been fine and dry, which makes a great
difference in a dolls' hospital.

At last he knew that he could do no more, and the under nurse had
already come twice to see whether the job was finished, as she coarsely
expressed it.

"Nina is not quite strong yet," Mr. Puckler had answered each time, for
he could not make up his mind to face the parting.

And now he sat before the square deal table at which he worked, and Nina
lay before him for the last time with a big brown paper box beside her.
It stood there like her coffin, waiting for her, he thought. He must put
her into it, and lay tissue paper over her dear face, and then put on
the lid, and at the thought of tying the string his sight was dim with
tears again. He was never to look into the glassy depths of the
beautiful brown eyes any more, nor to hear the little wooden voice say
"Pa-pa" and "Ma-ma." It was a very painful moment.

In the vain hope of gaining time before the separation, he took up the
little sticky bottles of cement and glue and gum and colour, looking at
each one in turn, and then at Nina's face. And all his small tools lay
there, neatly arranged in a row, but he knew that he could not use them
again for Nina. She was quite strong at last, and in a country where
there should be no cruel children to hurt her she might live a hundred
years, with only that almost imperceptible line across her face to tell
of the fearful thing that had befallen her on the marble steps of
Cranston House.

Suddenly Mr. Puckler's heart was quite full, and he rose abruptly from
his seat and turned away.

"Else," he said unsteadily, "you must do it for me. I cannot bear to see
her go into the box."

So he went and stood at the window with his back turned, while Else did
what he had not the heart to do.

"Is it done?" he asked, not turning round. "Then take her away, my dear.
Put on your hat, and take her to Cranston House quickly, and when you
are gone I will turn round."

Else was used to her father's queer ways with the dolls, and though she
had never seen him so much moved by a parting, she was not much
surprised.

"Come back quickly," he said, when he heard her hand on the latch. "It
is growing late, and I should not send you at this hour. But I cannot
bear to look forward to it any more."

When Else was gone, he left the window and sat down in his place before
the table again, to wait for the child to come back. He touched the
