Nor have we to do with the advance of spirit- 
ual enlightenment which could lead a father to 
baptize his baby : " He-that-believeth-not-on- 
Jesus-Christ-shall-be-damned." Nor with a 
theory of Biblical interpretation formulated in 
a theology which could require a girl to declare 
herself willing to be sent to hell if it were 
the will of God. 

To attack a man for the faith of his great- 
grandfather is only next to ascribing to him 
the sin of Adam, and ranks the rationalist 
among the barbarians at whom he sneers. 

There is something pathetic in the persist- 
ence with which unbelievers of a certain type 
fire away at buried creeds. It is like a 
cannonade in a cemetery. Who is hit ? Count 
your bleeding ghosts. Seek not the living 
among the dead. About face, if you would 
find a breathing foe ! 

Intelligent Christians to-day no more suppose
that babies go to hell than Strauss did. 
A growing proportion of such Christians do 
not believe that the Bible teaches the doctrine 
of an eternal hell at all. Instructed believers 
no more think that the majority of the human 
race are damned than Theodore Parker 
thought it. Even the representative 
theologian of the old-school orthodox faith in this 
country taught in his class-room that the majority 
of men are saved. The representative 
theologian of the new school is accustomed, 
before his students, to compare the number of 
the lost to the number of the saved as the
inmates of our prisons to the population outside 



of them. The modern Christian pulpit does 
not teach that heathen who never heard of 
Christ cannot be saved. The Christian parish 
does not learn that faith without character ever 
carried one single soul to heaven. We do not 
hold that hell is a lake of material fire. We 
do not hold that we are unable to do right 
when we wish to. Few of us think that God 
willfully foreordained some of his children to 
endless torture and some to endless peace, and 
that we cannot help ourselves, but must do as 
we were predestined to do, and abide the 
consequences and bless him for it. We do not 
believe that saints in heaven are happier for 
the sight of devils in hell. We do not believe 
that God gets angry. We do not believe that 
Christ died to satisfy the " vengeance " of his 
loving Father and ours. We do not believe 
that there is nothing good and beautiful and 
true in unconverted human nature. We do
