I suppose he did ; for he put no more questions for a 
minute or two. 

" There's one more thing,' he said. ' Now you know 
what I think of you ; what do you think of me, Diana ? ' 

' I think you are very imprudent,' she said, freeing 
herself resolutely and picking up her sunbonnet. ' Any- 
body might come, Mr. Knowlton.' 

' Anybody might ! But if ever you call me " Mr. Knowl- 
ton " again I'll do something extraordinary.' 

Diana thought he would have a great many things to 
teach her, beside that. She went at her fruit picking with 
bewildered haste. She did not know what she was doing, 
but mechanically her ringers flew and the berries fell. Mr. 
Knowlton picked rather more intelligently; but between 
them, I must say, they worked very well. Ah, the blackberry field had become a wonderful place ; and while the 
mellow purple fruit fell fast from the branches, it seemed 
also as if years had reached their fruition and the perfected 
harvest of life had come. Could riper or richer be, than had 
fallen into Diana's hands now? than filled them now ? So 
it was, she thought. And yet this was not life's harvest, only 




the bloom of the flower ; the fruit comes not to its maturity 
with one sunny day, and it needs more than sunshine. But 
let the fruit grow ; it will come in time, even if it ripens in 
secret ; and meanwhile smell the flower. It was the fragrance of the grape blossom that filled the blackberry 
field ; most sweet, most evanishing, most significant. 
Oddly, many people do not know it. But it must be 
that their life has never brought them within reach of its 
charm. 

Two people in the field never knew how the shadows 
grew long that day. No, not even though their colloquy 
was soon interrupted, and by Gertrude Masters herself. 
She thenceforth claimed, and received, Mr. Knowlton's 
whole services ; while Diana in her turn was assisted by 
Will Flandin, a young farmer of Pleasant Valley, who gave 
his hands and his arms to her help. It did not make much 
difference to Diana ; it might have been an ogre and she 
would not have cared ; so she hardly noticed that Will, 
who had a glib enough tongue in ordinary, was now very 
silent. Diana herself said nothing. She was listening to 
hidden music. 

' There's a wonderful lot o' blackberries on Bear Hill,' 
Will remarked at last. 

' Yes,' said Diana. 

' Well, I guess we've cleaned 'em out pretty well for this 
time,' pursued he. 

' Have we ? ' said Diana.
