glorious ramble over the nearest mountain and were sitting 
after supper in front of the small farmhouse where they had 
found lodging, looldng out upon the view. Twilight was 
settling down upon the green hills. Diana started and 
repeated his word. 

' Home ? ' 

' Yes. I mean, Pleasant Valley,' said the minister 
smiling. ' Not the house where I first saw you. There are 
one or two sick people, from whom I do not feel that I can 
be long away.' 

' You always think of other people first ! ' said Diana, 
almost with a sigh. 

' So do you.' 

' No, I do not. I do not think I do. It seems to me I 
have always thought most of myself.' 

' You can begin now then to do better.' 

' In thinking of you first, you mean ? O yes, I do. I 
will. But you think of people you do not care for.' 

' No, I don't. Never. You cannot think of people you 
do not care for, in the way you mean. They will not come 
into your head.' 



 

' How can one do then, Basil ? How do you do ? ' 

' Obviously, the only way is to care for them.' 

' Who is sick in Pleasant Valley ? ' 

' Nobody you know. One is an old man who lives back 
on the mountain ; the other is a woman near Blackberry hill.' 

' Blackberry hill ? do you go there ? ' 

' Now and then.' 

' But those are dreadful people there.' 

' Well ? ' said the minister. ' They want help so much 
the more.' 

' Help to live, do you mean ? They do stealing enough 
for that.' 

' Nobody lives by stealing,' said the minister. ' It is 
one of the ways of death ; and help to live is just what 
they want. But "how shall they believe on him of whom 
they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a 
preacher " ? '
