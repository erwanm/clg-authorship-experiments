is to take up that role of misanthrope which be- 
gins with yourself and leaves people to imagine 
how low an opinion you have of the rest of man- 
kind." 

Bartlett : " My dear fellow, you know I always 
speak well of that young lady. I've invariably 
told you that she behaved in the handsomest man- 
ner. She even expressed the wish I distinctly 
remember being struck by the novelty of the wish 
at the time that we should remain friends. 
You misconceive " 



 

Cummings : " How many poor girls have been 
jilted who don't go about doing misanthropy, but 
mope at home and sorrow and sicken over their 
wrong in secret, a wrong that attacks not merely 
their pride, but their life itself. Take the case 
I was telling you of: did you ever hear of any- 
thing more atrocious ? And do you compare this 
little sting to your vanity with a death-blow like 
that ? " 

Bartlett : " It 's quite impossible to compute the 
number of jilted girls who take the line you de- 
scribe. But if it were within the scope of arith- 
metic, I don't know that a billion of jilted girls 
would comfort me or reform me. I never could 
regard myself in that abstract way a mere unit 
on one side or other of the balance. My little per- 
sonal snub goes on rankling beyond the reach of 
statistical consolation. But even if there were any 
edification in the case of the young lady in Paris, 
she 's too far off to be an example for me. Take 
some jilted girl nearer home, Cummings, if you 
want me to go round sickening and sorrowing in 
secret. I don't believe you can find any. Women 



 

are much tougher about the pericardium than we 
give them credit for, my dear fellow, much. I 
don't see why it should hurt a woman more than a 
man to be jilted. We shall never truly philoso- 
phize this important matter till we regard women 
with something of the fine penetration arid impar- 
tiality with which they regard each other. Look at 
the stabs they give and take they would kill 
men ! And the graceful ferocity with which they 
dispatch any of their number who happens to be 
down is quite unexampled in natural history. How 
much do you suppose her lady friends have left of 
that poor girl whose case wrings your foolish bosom 
all the way from Paris ? I don't believe so much
