ashamed I am? Let me go down on my knees 
to thank you." Her father catches her to his 
heart, and fondly kisses her again and again. " I 
don't deserve it, papa! You ought to hate me, 
and drive me from you, and never let me see you 
again." She starts away from him as if to exe- 
cute upon herself this terrible doom, when her eye 
falls upon the letter where she had thrown it on 
the floor. " To think how long I have been the 
fool, the slave of that felon ! " She stoops upon 
the paper with a hawk-like fierceness ; she tears

Constance: "Oh, don't jest it away! It's 
your soul that I see now, your true and brave and 
generous heart ; and if you pardoned me for mis- 
taking you a single moment for one who had
