and smoking. 

I would not make a wanton jest here of Mrs. 
Johnson's anxiety to claim honor for the African 
color, while denying this color in many of her own 
family. It afforded a glimpse of the pain which all 
her people must endure, however proudly they hide 
it or light-heartedly forget it, from the despite and 
contumely to which they are guiltlessly bom : and 
when I thought how irreparable was this disgrace 
and calamity of a black skin, and how irreparable it 
must be for ages yet, in this world where every other 
shame and all manner of wilftd guilt and wickedness 
may hope for covert and pardon, I had little heart 
to laugh. Indeed, it was so pathetic to hear this 
poor old soul talk of her dead and lost ones, and try, 
in spite of all Mr. Johnson's theories and her own 
arrogant generalizations, to establish their whiteness, 
that we must have been very cruel and silly people 
to turn her sacred fables even into matter of ques- 
tion. I have no doubt that her Antoinette Anastasia 
and her Thomas Jefferson Wilberforce — it is impos- 
sible to give a full idea of the splendor and scope of 
the baptismal names in Mrs. Johnson's family — have 
as light skins and as golden hair in heaven as her 

reverend maternal fancy painted for them in our 
world. There, certainly, they would not be subject to 
tanning, which had ruined the delicate complexion, 
and had knotted into black woolly tangles the once 
wavy blonde locks of our little maid-servant Naomi ; 
and I would fain believe that Toussaint Washington 
Johnson, who ran away to sea so many years ago, 
has found some fortunate zone where his hair and 
skin keep the same sunny and rosy tints they wore 
to his mother's eyes in infancy. But I have no 
means of knowing this, or of telling whether he was 
the prodigy of intellect that he was declared to be. 
Naomi could no more be taken in proof of the one 
assertion than of the other. When she came to us, 
it was agreed that she should go to school ; but she 
overruled her mother in this as in everything else, 
and never went. Except Sunday-school lessons, she 
had no other instruction than that her mistress gave 
her in the evenings, when a heavy day's play and 
the natural influences of the hour conspired with 
original causes to render her powerless before words 
of one syllable. 

The first week of her service she was obedient 
and faithful to her duties ; but, relaxing in the at- 
mosphere of a house which seems to demoralize all 
menials, she shortly fell into disorderly ways of lying 
in wait for callers out of doors, and, when people 
rang, of running up the front steps, and letting them 
in from the outside. As the season expanded, and 
the fine weather became confirmed, she modified 
even this form of service, and spent her time in the
