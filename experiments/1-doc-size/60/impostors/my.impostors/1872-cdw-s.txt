it. 

We took carriages at nine o'clock to Resina, a drive 
of four miles, and one of exceeding interest, if you wish 
to see Naples life. The way is round the curving bay 
by the sea; but so continuously built up is it, and so 
enclosed with high walls of villas, through the open 
gates of which the golden oranges gleam, that you seem 
never to leave the city. The streets and quays swarm 
with the most vociferous, dirty, multitudinous life. It is 
a drive through Rag Fair. The tall, whitey-yellow 
houses fronting the water, six, seven, eight stories high, 
are full as bee-hives ; people are at all the open windows ; 
garments hang from the balconies and from poles thrust 
out; up every narrow, gloomy, ascending street are 
crowds of struggling human shapes ; and you see how 
like herrings in a box are packed the over half a million 
people of Naples. In front of the houses are the mar- 
kets in the open air, — fish, vegetables, carts of oranges ; 
in the sun sit women spinning from distaffs or weaving 
fishing-nets ; and rows of children who were never washed 
and never clothed but once, and whose garments have 





nearly wasted away ; beggars, fishermen in red caps, 
sailors, priests, donkeys, fruit-venders, street-musicians, 
carriages, carts, two-wheeled break-down vehicles, — the 
whole tangled in one wild roar and rush and Babel, — a 
shifting, varied panorama of color, rags, — a pandemonium 
such as the world cannot show elsewhere, — thai is what 
one sees on the road to Resina. The drivers all drive 
in the streets here as if they held a commission from the 
Devil, cracking their whips, shouting to their horses, and 
dashing; into the thickest tangle with entire recklessness. 
They have one cry, used alike for getting more speed out 
of their horses or for checking them, or in warning to 
the endangered crowds on foot. It is an exclamatory 
grunt, which may be partially expressed by the letters 
" a-e-ugh." Everybody shouts it, — mule-driver, "coachee," 
or cattle driver; and even I, a passenger, fancied I could 
do it to disagreeable perfection after a time. Out of this 
throng in the streets I like to select the meek, patient, 
diminutive little donkeys, with enormous panniers that 
almost hide them. One would have a woman seated on 
top, with a child in one pannier and cabbages in the 
other ; another, with an immense stock of market-greens 
on his back, or big baskets of oranges, or with a row of 
wine-casks and a man seated behind, adhering, by some 
unknown law of adhesion, to the sloping tail. Then 
there was the cart drawn by one diminutive donkey, or 
by an ox, or by an ox and a donkey, or by a donkey and 
horse abreast, — never by any possibility a matched team. 
And, funniest of all, was the high, two-wheeled caCeche, 
with one seat, and top thrown back, with long thills and 
poor horse. Upon this vehicle were piled, Heaven knows 
how, behind, before, on the thills, and underneath the 
high seat, sometimes ten, and not seldom as many as
