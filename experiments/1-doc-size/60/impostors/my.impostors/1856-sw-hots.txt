"Not mine, to be sure," said Elizabeth after a little thought,
-- "nor hers."

"Hers is a light shade of what rests upon many."

"Why Mr. Winthrop! do you think so?"

"Look at her," he said in a low voice; -- "she has forgotten
her empty basket in a sweet fig."

"But she must take it up again."

"She won't lessen her burden, but she will her power of
forgetting."

Elizabeth sat still, looking at her vis-Ã -vis of life, and
feeling very uneasily what she had never felt before. She
began therewith to ponder sundry extraordinary propositions
about the inequalities of social condition and the relative
duties of man to man.

"What right have I," she said suddenly, "to so much more than
she has?"

"Very much the sort of right that I have to be an American,
while somebody else is a Chinese."

"Chance," said Elizabeth.

"No, there is no such thing as chance," he said seriously.

"What then?"

"The fruit of industry, talent, and circumstance."

"Not mine."

"No, but your father's, who gives it to you."

"But why ought I to enjoy more than she does? -- in the
abstract, I mean."

"I don't know," said Winthrop. -- "I guess we had better walk on
now, Miss Elizabeth."

"Walk on! -- it rains too hard."

"But we are in the shed, while other people are out?"

"No but, -- suppose that by going out I could bring them in?"

"Then I would certainly act as your messenger," he said
smiling. "But you can't reach all the people who are so
careless as to go out without umbrellas."

Elizabeth was betrayed into a laugh --a genuine hearty laugh of
surprise, in which her awkwardness was for a moment forgotten.

"How came you to bring one, such a day?"
