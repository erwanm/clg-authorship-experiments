Germain as guests of the artist and his friend Mr. 
Flack would not be of the company : she was sure 
those gentlemen would not invite him. In fact 
she was too acute, for though he liked him little, 
Charles Waterlow would on this occasion have 
made a point of expressing by a hospitable attitude

Mr. Dosson had by this time learned to trust the 
European manager of the Reverberator to spend 
his moDey almost as he himself would.

instinctively not separated ; they dropped into the 
first place and sat looking at each other and at the 
highly-decorated lamps that burned, night after

sister, speaking as if this remark were a continua 
tion, which it was not, of something they had 
lately been saying. 

" Stop what ? " asked Francie, reaching forward 
for a marron. 

"Stop carrying on the way you do with 
Mr. Flack." 

Francie stared, while she consumed her marron;
