Adam, it was no part of his step-mother's 
programme to let the fires of antagonism 
go out for lack of fuel. Oil and faggot 
were always at hand, and furnished with 
out stint, so that they were perpetually 
in a blaze. It ended as the step-mother 
desired. Adam left the house in a pas 
sion, vowing not to cross the threshold again, and took 
lodgings at one of the hotels. This occurred in a week 
after the brief interview mentioned as having taken 
place between Adam and Doctor Hofland. In order to 
make this separation complete, Mrs. Guy gathered ev 
erything belonging to the young man clothing, books 
and other articles and sent them to his address at the 
hotel, accompanied by a note couched in language that 
left him in no doubt of her purpose to hold him forever 
at a distance. He had turned from the door of his fath 
er's house, and now it was closed against him. He 
was out in the world alone, friendless and almost pow 
erless. As he sat, in the small room at the hotel so 
mean and poor compared with the one he left sat 
there on the first night of his voluntary exile, and 
looked into the dark, mysterious future, his heart shiv- 



 

ered, his spirit grew faint and fearful. He realized 
more consciously than ever, that his step-mother was too 
strong and subtle for him, that in her hands, he was 
weak as an infant. 

As Adam sat thus, alone, looking with dismay at the 
prospect before him, Mr. Larobe and his step-mother 
were in close conference. 

" You say," remarked Mrs. Guy, " that he has nev 
er called on you to ask the direction of the Asylum." 

" I have not seen him," answered the lawyer. 

" Just as I supposed it would be. Not a spark of 
filial love burns in one of their souls. I never saw such 
a heartless brood. If they had their father's money, he 
might be at the bottom of the ocean for all they cared." 

" You think that Adam will not return here ? " said 
Mr. Larobe. 

" He can't return." Mrs. Guy's voice was soft and 
low, but it expressed the purpose of an iron will. 

" I received a letter from Doctor Du Pontz to-day," 
remarked the lawyer. 

" Well ! What does he write ? " The manner of 
Mrs. Guy changed instantly, and she leaned towards 
her companion with an expression of hope on her coun 
tenance.
