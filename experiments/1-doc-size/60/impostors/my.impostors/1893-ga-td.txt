body rarely harbors an invalid soul, and she 
had only to spring on a horse and gallop over 
the hills to feel as happy as a young animal. 
Moreover, the world — all the world she knew 
— was at her feet ; nor had she ever known the 
novelty of an ungratified wish. Once in a 
while her father arose in an obdurate mood, 
but she had only to coax, or threaten tears, — 
never had she been seen to shed one, — or stamp 
her foot, to bring that doting parent to terms. 
It is true that she had had her morbid moments, 
an abrupt impatient desire for something that 
was not all light and pleasure and gold and ad- 
ulation ; but, being a girl of will and sense, 
she had turned resolutely from the troublous 
demands of her deeper soul, regarding them as 
coals fallen from a mind that burned too hotly 
at times. 

This morning, however, she let the blue 
waters rise, not so rnucb because they were 




stronger than her will, as because she wished 
to understand what was the matter with her. 
She was filled with a dull dislike of every one 
she had ever known, of every condition which 
had surrounded her from birth. She felt a deep 
disgust of placid contentment, of the mere 
enjoyment of sunshine and air. She recalled 
drearily the clock-like revolutions of the year 
which brought bull-fights, races, rodeos, church 
celebrations ; her mother's anecdotes of the 
Indians ; her father's manifold interests, ever 
the theme of his tongue ; Reinaldo's 
grandiloquent accounts of his exploits and intentions ; 
Prudencia's infinite nothings. She hated the 
balls of which she was La Favorita, the 
everlasting serenades, the whole life of pleasure 
which made that period of California the most 
perfected Arcadia the modern world has known. 
Some time during the past few weeks the girl 
had crossed her hands over her breast and lain 
down in her eternal tomb. The woman had 
arisen and come forth, blinded as yet by the 
light, her hands thrust out gropingly. 

" It is that man, "she told herself, with angry 
frankness. "I had not talked with him ten 
minutes before I felt as I do when the scene 
changes suddenly in one of Shakespeare's 
plays, — as if I had been flung like a meteor into 

a new world. I felt the necessity for mental 
alertness for the first time in my life ; always, 
before, I had striven to conceal what I knew. 
The natural consequences, of course, were first 
the desire to feel that stimulation again and
