     "When I wrote to you, last week," was the unceremonious
     commencement,--"I said that I would await your reply before
     sending another letter. I believed that the information
     contained in the former would be the means of terminating our
     engagement. I have learned since that the story was a
     malicious or idle exaggeration. My mother died, as she had
     lived, a sane woman. But this matters little so far as our
     relation to one another is concerned. Another, and an
     insuperable obstacle to our union, exists in the change of my
     feelings toward yourself. If I ever loved you--I think,
     sometimes, I never did--I love you no longer. Months of doubt
     and suffering have brought me to the determination to confess
     this without reserve. I offer no extenuation of my fickleness.
     I ought to have remained constant, but I have not. May you
     choose more happily and wisely in the future!

     "I write this without conference with my father or sister,--in
     the knowledge, also, that my change of purpose and prospects
     will be a sorrow and a surprise to both. But I cannot hesitate
     or draw back. I need hardly say that I have entered into
     pledges with no one else. No one desires that I should, or
     seeks to win my affections. It rests with you to give me the
     release I ask of your generosity and humanity, or to hold me to
     the letter of my bond. If, having learned the extent of the
     change that has come over me since I gave it, you insist upon
     the fulfilment of my promise, I shall submit to your decision.

     "Foreseeing what your action will be, it only remains for me to
     add that your gifts and letters await your order.

CHAPTER XV.


The September nights were cool among the mountains, and as Mr. Kirke
and his elder daughter drove home through the moonlight, between
eleven and twelve o'clock, from the visit of mercy they had been
paying on the other side of the ridge, there were white blankets of
mist upon the meadows, and filling up the valleys along which their
route lay.

The fire was out in the kitchen, and Patsey had been asleep for two
hours and more, having made up her mind that her master would not
return until the morrow. There was still a light in Jessie's
chamber, and she came down, wide-awake and dressed, to admit
the travellers. The servant man slept in a room over the stable,
and, after calling to him two or three times without arousing him,
the worthy clergyman took pity upon his weariness after his hard
day's work, and groomed his horse himself. Eunice exclaimed at
the dampness of his overcoat in helping him remove it, and
Jessie--instructed in such appliances to health and comfort by her
watery adventure, the telling of which she reserved for a more
convenient season--prescribed a glass of brandy-and-water. Mr. Kirke
needed nothing except a night's rest, he assured them both; pinched
Jessie's cheek, in kissing her "good-night," and rallied her upon
her anti-temperance proclivities, then ascended to his chamber. He
