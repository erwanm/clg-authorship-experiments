single hour she had so altered as to be ugly, with 
out a trace of the charm that had haunted him ; 
and the other the sense that, thus ravaged and dis 
figured, wrecked in the gust that had come and 
gone, she expected of him something that she had 
never expected. A monstrous reality flared up 
in their relation, the perception of which was a 
shock that he was conscious for the moment of 
betraying that he feared, finding no words to 
answer her and showing her across the room, 




 

while she repeated her question, a face blanched 
by the change in her own. " For what did you 
come back to me? for what did you come

He gaped at her; then, as if there were help 
for him in the simple fact that, on his own side, 
he could immediately recall, he stammered out: 
" To you to you ? I hadn't the slightest notion

me. You've overwhelmed me, I say, because I 
speak from the depths of my surrender. But you 
didn't do it, I imagine, to be cruel, and if you 
didn't do it to be cruel you did it to take what it 
would give you." Gradually, as she talked, he 
faced round again ; she stood there supported by 
the high back of a chair, either side of which she 
held tight. " You know what I am, if any man
