she will gain her strength that way. Dissipation wears 
out the higher classes as fast as work does the poorer 
people,'' he says. 

After he is gone, Mr. St. Greorge is announced. 

"I must get up and see him," Dolly exclaims, spring-

am so weak ! '' And tears stand in her eyes, making the 
expression of her small face piteous in its entreaty. "I 
shall soon be better though. Tell him â€” give him my 
love, my very best love." 

Christmas goes down, still iu a dream. Mr. St. George 
is grave and quite concerned about Dolly's illness. He

prostrated as well." 

It occurs to Miss Ormiston that she has made no call, 
sent no message of condolence, so she begs St. George to 
wait until she writes a brief note, which, after all, is prin-

"I will be over again early in the morning," he an- 
nounces, lingering as if loath to go, but Christmas makes 
no sign. 

The house is quiet enough after Miss Miller's return. 
Every one is tired and the bed is most welcome. 



 



 





Christmas takes a last look at Dolly, who sleeps tranquilly, 
and as Fanny really is pleased to attend upon her, she 
goes to her room, worn out by the day's excitements and 
tortured by a thousand fears. 

The latter part of the night Dolly is quite restless, but 
just after daybreak drops off to slumber again, so St. 
Greorge does not see her in his morning call. There would 
be no tune for confidence, even if Miss Ormiston had 
resolyed upon her course, but she is in a state of wildest 
irresolution, weighing duty against duty. 

" Telegraph to me night aad morning," he says with
