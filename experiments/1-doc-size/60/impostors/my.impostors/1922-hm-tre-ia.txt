was the ache in her heart. 

At breakfast both of them played their parts skil- 
fully. There was nothing in his manner to suggest the 
misery of the preceding night. There was nothing on 
her face to hint of the misery that brimmed her heart 
this morning. So they fenced with smiles. 

He noted that she was fully dressed, that her 
hair was carefully done, that there was a knotted 
ribbon around her throat. It now occurred to him 
that she had always been fully dressed. He did not 
know —  and probably never would unless she told 
him —  that it was very easy (and comfortable for a 
woman) to fall into slatternly ways in this latitude. 
So long as she could remember, her father had 
never permitted her to sit at the table unless she 
came fully dressed. Later, she understood his rea- 
sons; and it had now become habit. 


Fascination. It would be difficult to find another 
liuman being subjected to so many angles of attack 
as Spurlock. Ruth loved him. This did not tickle 
liis vanity; on the contrary, it enlivened his terror, 
ivhich is a phase of fascination. She loved him. 
That held his thought as the magnet holds the 
needle, inescapably. The mortal youth in him, then, 
was fascinated, the thinker, the poet; from all sides 
Huth attacked him, innocently. The novel danger of 
the situation enthralled him. He saw himself retreat-

While he was stirring his tea, she ran and fetched 
the comb. She attacked his hair resolutely. He 
laughed to hide his uneasiness. The touch of her 
hands was pleasurable. 

The part was crooked,'' she explained. 
I don't believe McClintock would have gone 
into convulsions at the sight of it. Anyhow, ten 
minutes after I get to work I'll be rumpling it." 

"That isn't the point, Hoddy. You don't notice 
the heat; but it is always there, pressing down. You 
must always shave and part your hair straight. It 
doesn't matter that you deal with black people. 
It isn't for. their sakes, it's for your own. Mr. Mc- 
Clintock does it; and he knows why. In the morn- 
ing and at night he is dressed as he would dress in 
the big hotels. In the afternoon he probably loafs 
in his pajamas. You can, too, if you wish."
