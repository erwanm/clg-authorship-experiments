" She's in Paris, with her mother — on their way to Aix- 
les-Bains." Then, with impatience, she continued : " Do 
you know that's a great deal to say — what you said just 
now ? I mean about your being the best friend I have." 





  

"Of course I do, and that's exactly why I said it. 
Yon see Tm not in the least delicate or graceful or shy 
about it — I just come out with it and defy you to con- 
tradict me. Who, if I'm not the best, is a better one ?" 

"Well, ' Nanda replied, ' I feel since I've known Mr. 
Longdon that I've almost the sort of friend who makes 
nobody else count." 

" Then, at the end of three months, he has arrived at 
a value for you that I haven't reached in all these years ?" 

"Yes," she returned — "the value of my not being 
afraid of him." 

Vanderbank, on the bench, shifted his position, turn- 
ing more to her, with an arm over the back. "And 
you're afraid of me f 

" Horribly — hideously." 

" Then our long, happy relations — " 

"They're just what make my terror," she broke in, 
"particularly abject. Happy relations don't matter. I 
always think of you with fear." 

His elbow was on the back of the seat, and his hand 
supported his head. "How awfully curious — if it be 
true !" 

She had been looking away to the sweet English dis- 
tance, but at this she made a movement. "Oh, Mr. 
Van, I'm 'true'!" 

As Mr. Van himself could not have expressed, at any 
subsequent time, to any interested friend, the particular 
effect upon him of the tone of these words, his chronicler 
takes advantage of the fact not to pretend to a greater 
intelligence — to limit himself, on the contrary, to the 
simple statement that they produced in Mr. Van's cheek 
a just discernible flush. "Fear of what ?" 

"I don't know. Fear is fear." 

"Yes, yes — I see." He took out another cigarette 
and occupied a moment in lighting it. " Well, kindness 
is kindness too — that's all one can say."
