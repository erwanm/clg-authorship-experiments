Edward Brookenham, under the influence of this dem- 
onstration, had gradually risen from his seat, and as his 
wife approached that part of her process which might be 
expected to furnish the proof he placed himself before her 
with his back to the fire. " And Mitchy, I suppose ?" 

But he was out. " No. Mitchy's different." 

He wondered. "Different ?" 

"Not a help. Quite a drawback." Then as his face 
told how these were involutions, "you needn't under- 
stand, but you can believe me," she added. " The one 
who does most is of course Van himself." It was a state- 
ment by which his failure to apprehend was not dimin- 
ished, and she completed her operation. " By not liking 
her." 

Edward's gloom, on this, was not quite blankness, yet 
it was dense. "Do you like his not liking her ?" 

"Dear no. No better than he does." 

"And he doesn't—?" 



' Oh, he hates it." 

 '' Of course I haven't asked him," Edward appeared to 
say more to himself than to his wife. 

''And of course  I haven't," she returned — not at all in 
this case, plainly, for herself. " But I know it. He'd 
like her if he could, but he can't. That," Mrs. Brook 
wound up, "is what makes it sure." 

There was at last in Edward's gravity a positive pathos. 
 '' Sure he won't propose ?" 

'' Sure Mr. Longdon won't now throw her over." 

" Of course if it is sure — " 

'' Well ?" 

''Why, it is. But of course if it isn't — " 

" Well ?" 

" Why, she won't have anything. Anything but us," 
he continued to reflect. "Unless, you know, you're 
working it on a certainty — " 

" That's just what I am working it on. I did nothing 
till I knew I was safe." 

"'Safe'?" he ambiguously echoed, while, on this, 
their eyes met longer.
