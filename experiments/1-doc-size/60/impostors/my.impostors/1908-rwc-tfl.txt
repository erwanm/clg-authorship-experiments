"With my gown half off!--what would you have done?" demanded the girl
hotly.

"Destroyed him," admitted Shiela, "in one way or another, dear. And now
I am going to bed--if everybody has had enough of Cissy's Bridge--"

"Me for the hay," observed Gray emphatically.

So they all went up the stairway together, lingering a few moments on
the landing to say good night.

Cecile retired first, bewailing the humiliation of not having a maid of
her own and requesting Shiela to send hers as she was too sleepy to
undress.

Gray caught sight of a moth fluttering around the electric lights and
made considerable noise securing the specimen. After which he also
retired, cyanide jar containing the victim tucked under his arm.




CHAPTER XVIII

PERIL


Shelia, standing by the lamplit table and resting one slim hand on the
edge of it, waited for Hamil to give the signal for separation.

Instead he said: "Are you really sleepy?"

"No."

"Then--"

"I dare not--to-night."

"For any particular reason?"

"For a thousand.... One is that I simply can't believe you are really
going North to-morrow. Why do you?" She had asked it nearly a thousand
times.

"I've got to begin Portlaw's park; and, besides, my work here is over--"

"Is that all you care about me? Oh, you are truly like the real Ulysses:

    "Now toils the hero, trees on trees o'erthrown
    Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan!"

Do you remember, in the Odyssey, when poor Calypso begs him to remain?

    "Thus spoke Calypso to her god-like guest:
    'This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,
      And learn'd in all the wiles of human thought,
    How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!
    Thus wilt thou leave me? Are we thus to part?
    Is Portlaw's Park the passion of thy heart?'"
