“ But they wouldn’t take it all ? ” 

“Then there are the taxes, — Sigma Eps., 
and all, my dear.” 

“ But taxes and Sarah Eps, — would they 
take it all ? ” 

“ Well, a fellow wants something to get 
drunk on.” 


“ Oh, Tom ! ” 


“ Well, for sprees — gales — good times —

catch the last of the lingering light ; scraps of 
ribbon and silk and tinsel were scattered about 
her on the floor. It was evident that something 
very mysterious and important was going on ; 
for her door was locked, and nobody was 
allowed to come in.
