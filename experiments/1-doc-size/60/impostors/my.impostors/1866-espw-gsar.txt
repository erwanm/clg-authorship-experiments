says I treat him as if he were a great Maltese 
cat), and I said I was going to be good to him ; 
as good as I could be ; terribly good ; a cherub ; 
a pretty pink cherub with wings ; would he give 
me a kiss? So he gave me a kiss, and I snug- 
gled up in his arms just as if nothing had 
happened, and we had the nicest little talk, and 
he told me ever so much, Peace, that I can’t 
tell you, about college, and how hard it was 
to do right, and how sorry he felt afterwards, 
and how he did things and didn’t think, — just 


like me, for all the world, and I don’t suppose 
I should be half as good as he if I went to col- 
lege, — and how sometimes he thought about 
me, and didn’t go off with Hall because I should 
be sorry. Now, Peace Maythorne, I wonder

you possibly. Anyway, it made up for that 
dreadful night out on the stairs, and for going 
to East Yorkbury, and for doing things when I

“Then I stopped. ‘Tom,’ said I, ‘"I told 
you I loved you more than ever, and I do. But 


there’s another tiling. I used to be — proud 
of you.’ You ought to have seen his eyes! 

‘ Well, you shall be proud of me again some 
day.’ I told him that was just what I meant to 
be, but that I did wish I could be real sure. 
Then he fired up like everything, and wanted 
to know if I thought he meant to get drunk 
again ; of course he shouldn’t ; he hadn’t any 
thoughts of it ; he shouldn’t have this time if 
the whisky hadn’t been so bad. Well, you 
see, I knew he might, for all that, so I told 
him I wished he would promise me something. 
‘What is it?’ said he. I told him it was that 
he wouldn’t ever touch the old thing, nor any
