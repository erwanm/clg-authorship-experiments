ters go on smoothly. There is such a difference 
in that. She kept the children good-natured 
and we were all as busy as bees. 

Just as we were hurrying our utmost, about 
mid-afternoon a carriage stopped. Daisy ran to 
the side window to reconnoitre. 

"It is the Maynards," she announced, "and 
a whole load of ladies." 

" Some one must go- -Rose ! ' 

" O, dear, no, not 

" For Joe, to be slangy," and Fan laughed. 
"But you have just finished the carpet, and you 
are the eldest, and you can brush up your hair 
so quickly. Here, wash your face and I'll get 
out your dress." 



 

I washed and brushed, or rather just ran the 
comb through my hair and twisted it in a great 
knot, put on some tidy slippers and a blue 
cambric with ruffles at the wrist and throat. 
While I was fastening my brooch Fan tied a 
pale blue ribbon in my hair. 

" There you look as sweet as a pink, only I 
never saw any blue pinks. Don't say you are 
just out of the soap-suds. Remember to uphold 
the family credit.'' 

It was "all of the Maynards," and a very 
elegant young gentleman. Mrs. Silverthorne and 
the Misses Maynards were going West next 
week, and had come to make a farewell call. 
They were very sorry to miss mamma - - how could 
we cret alone without her ? 

I said Mrs. Whitcomb was here taking charge 
of us. 

"There;" began Mrs. Silverthorne, "Matilda, 
I don't see why you can't get her to come and 
stay with grandma this winter, and you go to 
the City for two months or so. I am sure if 
Mrs. Eiidicott feels it safe to leave all of her 
children, you might leave just one person." 

"Mamma lias the baby and my youngest sis- 
ter with her," I returned. " And she only 
expects to stay a \veek."
