I was after him in a minute, for there he had 
Tabby by the nape of the neck, holding her up 
high to see her draw up her feet and curl her 
tail between her legs like a dog. 

"Put her down!" I cried, authoritatively. 

He held me off with one arm. 

"Why, she likes it," he said. "Look! what

"But if Tabby was yours '
