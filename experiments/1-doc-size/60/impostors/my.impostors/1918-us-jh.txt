and feathered in a free speech fight in San Diego. And now 
he told the members of Local Leesville what he thought of those 
tea-party revolutionists who pandered to the respectability of a 
church-ridden community. "Wild Bill" had watched the dis- 
cussions over "Section Six' the provision in the constitution of 
the party against sabotage and violence; the very same persons 
who had been enthusiastic for that bit of middle-class fakery 
were now trying to line up the local for the defence of the British 
sea-power ! What the hell difference did it make to any work- 
ingman whether or not the Kaiser got a railroad to Bagdad? 
Of course, if a man had been to school in Britain, and had a 
British wife, and felt himself a British gentleman you could 
feel the shudder that went through the gathering, for every one 
knew that this was Dr. Service all right, let that man take the 
first ship across the ocean and enlist; but let him not try to 
turn an American Socialist local into a recruiting-agency for 
British landlords and aristocrats. 

This brought to his feet Comrade Norwood, the young lawyer 
who had helped to put through "Section Six" in the National 





Convention of the party. If there were people so keen against 
this Section, why couldn't they get out of the party and form 
an organisation of their own? 

"Because," answered Murray, "we prefer sabotage to strik- 
ing!" 

"In other words," continued Norwood, "you stay in the local, 
and hy a campaign of sneering and personalities you drive your 
opponents out !" 

"This is the first meeting for some months that we have had 
the pleasure of seeing Comrade Norwood," said "Wild Bill," 
with venomous placidity. "Perhaps he knew that we were to 
be asked to raise a regiment for Kitchener !" 

And then again Comrade Stankewitz was on his feet, with 
distress in his thin, eager face. "Comrades, all this vill not 
get us anyvere ! There is but vun question ve have to answer, 
are ve internationalists, or are ve not?" 

"It seems to me," continued Norwood, "the question is, are 
we anti-nationalists ?" 

"All right!" shrilled the little Jew. "I vill leave it so I 
am an anti-nationalist! Such must all Socialists be!" 

"But I don't understand it so," declared the young lawyer. 
"It is easy for some who belong to a race which has not had 
a country for two thousand years " 

"And who's dealing in personalities now?" sneered "Wild 
BiH."
