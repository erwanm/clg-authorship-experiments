So about ten o'clock they started out.

"You've got a good horse here," said Dick.

"He ought to be. Mother paid four hundred dollars for him."

"Did she, though? You ought to have got me to send you one from the
West. For half the money I'd have sent you a better one."

"I don't believe it."

"Because you don't know. I do."

"It takes a good driver to drive this horse," said Nicholas.

"Does it? I could drive this horse blindfolded."

He spoke contemptuously, and Nicholas was nettled. He prided himself
upon his driving ability, and now his uncle underestimated it.

"The horse is not as easy to drive as you think," he said. "If you don't
believe it, take the reins and see."

"All right."

This was what Dick wanted, for he had a plan for revenging himself on
his upstart nephew. He drove on till he got to a place where there was a
muddy and miry puddle beside the road. Then by a dexterous manoeuver,
for he understood driving thoroughly, he managed to overturn the wagon,
and Nicholas was thrown headlong into the puddle. Dick leaped out just
at the right time, retaining his hold on the reins.

Bespattered with mud and drenched with mire, Nicholas arose from the
puddle a sorry figure.

"What did you do that for?" he demanded, wrathfully, surveying himself
with disgust.

"I'm afraid I can't manage your horse," said Dick, with hypocritical
meekness. "He was too much for me."

"Didn't I tell you so?" said Nicholas, triumphing in spite of his woful
condition.

"I'm sorry you fell into the puddle. Why didn't you jump, as I did?"

"I didn't have time," said Nicholas, ruefully. "What a figure I am!"

"I suppose we may as well go home."

"Yes," said Nicholas, sullenly. "That comes of giving you the reins."

"You are right," said Dick. "You'd better drive home yourself."

Nicholas took the reins, but it mortified him not a little to see the
looks of wonder and amusement which he attracted as he passed through
the village.

Dick laughed to himself.
