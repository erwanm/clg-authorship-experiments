 

asked Dolly. She was busy at a side table, arranging something in a little frame, and did not look 
up from her work. 

" I should think I did ! " was Mrs. Copley's rejoinder. "What don't I want, from breath up?" 

"Here you have had one wish fulfilled to-day 
you have seen the Green vaults and now we 
are going to Venice to fulfil another wish what 
would you have ? " 

"I don't like to think I am going away from 
here. I like Dresden best of all the places we've 
been in. And I would like to go through the 
Green vaults but why they are called so I cannot conceive about once every month. I would 
never get tired." 

" So you would like to settle in Dresden ? " said 
Lawrence. " I don't think it would be safe to let 
you go through the Green vaults often, Mi-s. Copley; you would certainly be tempted too much for 
your principles. Miss Dolly, we had better get her 
away. When do we go, by the by ? " 

Instead of answering, Dolly rose up and brought 
him something to look at; a plain little oval frame 
of black wood, within which was a head in light 
water colours. 

"Mrs. Copley ! " exclaimed Lawrence. 

"Is it like?" 

" Striking ! Capital. I'm not much of a judge 
of painting in general, but I know a friend's face 
when I see it; and this is to the life. To the life! 
Graceful, too. Where did you get it ? " 



 

" I got the paper and the paints at a little shop 
in I forget the name of the strasse; and mother 
was here to my hand. Ecco ! " 

"You don't mean you did it?" said Lawrence, 
while the others crowded near to look. 

" I used to amuse myself with that kind of thing 
when I was at school, and I had always a knack 
at catching likenesses. I am going to try you, 
Rupert, next." 

" Ah, try me ! " cried Lawrence. " Will you ? 
and we will stay in Dresden till it is done." 

"Suppose I succeed," said Dolly softly, "will 
you get me orders ? "
