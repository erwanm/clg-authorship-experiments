vice to ask that we may stand once again upon our 
old footing. Quarrelling is a new and unpleasant business 
to us, my dear fellow !" 

"It is!" Aleck wrung the proffered hand. "I thought 
you would understand me better when you came to think 
over the matter. You can never know how dear your hapness is to me, Robin, or the pain this estrangement has cost 
me." 

They sat down, side by side, and talked freely and affec 
tionately one of them happily, until the clock struck three. 

" Never mind the march of Father Time !" said Robert, 
as the other exclaimed at the lateness of the hour. " The 
faster he gallops, the better pleased am I ! We shall not 
have many more such seasons of dissipation either. The hab 
its of a staid Benedict and householder, such as I hope soon 
to be, must be, perforce, diametrically opposed to irregular 
hours, and I fancy that your Gretchen will knit her pretty 
brows at these propensities in her husband. Ah ! Aleck ! 
you have not acted quite fairly with me in that affair. Here 
I have turned out the lining of my heart to you, and you 
have been keeping your most precious secret locked away 
from my brotherly eyes." 

" I do not understand !" answered Aleck, inquiringly. 

" You hypocritical rascal !" Robert collared him, an 
searched his face with his mirthful eyes. " Do you persist in your deceit ? Is Aunt Ruth the only worthy depositar 
for your confidences ? Do you dare to deny that you are 
every whit as deeply in love as I am ? still to keep up the 
flimsy pretence that the improvements going forward, with 





such un-German velocity, at Maple Hill, arc designed for 
your personal delectation and our good aunt's comfort, you 
dutiful dog ?" 

"Soho !" Light beamed over Aleck's puzzled visage. " I 
begin to comprehend ! And you were blessed with a perusal of the private and confidential missive directed to Aunt 
Ruth, and crammed with eulogies upon the little German 
beauty ? You were so verdant as to swallow the hoax I in 
tended as a reward for her monthly epistles upon the dangers to which a marriageable young man is exposed when 
he has no aunt near to guard him from temptation, and the 
passing importance of making a judicious choice of a pardner, as she pronounces it? Gretchen, forsooth ! The jade 
never cared three straws for me, nor I one for her !" 

"I am glad, and sorry too !" replied Robert. "Pleased 
that I am not to have a foreign sister-in-law ; very sorry that 
the high place in your heart is yet vacant. My happiness 
makes me sympathize the more keenly in your poverty in 
this regard. You could love warmly and truly, Aleck ; and 
if you had that summum bonum of earthly blessings, Aunt 
Ruth's well-chosen pardner, would prove yourself a capital husband." 

" Thank you ! If I ever summon courage to try the experiment, I will apply to you for a certificate to that effect," 
Aleck promised, with a laugh, as they separated with an
