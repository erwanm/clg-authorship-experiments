Rasmith that, for he had not known it, and he 



 

went so far in her condemnation as to wonder how 
she could say such a thing. His mother said it was 
not very nice, and then suggested that perhaps she 
had heard it from some one else, and thought it 
was he. She acquitted him of complicity with 
Miss Rasmith in forbearing to contradict her; and 
it seemed to her a fitting time to find out from 
Boyne what she honestly could about the relation 
of the Rasmiths to Mr. Breckon. It was very little 
beyond their supposition, which every one else had 
shared, that he was going to land with them at 
Boulogne, and he must have changed his mind very 
suddenly. Boyne had not heard the Rasmiths speak 
of it. Miss Rasmith never spoke of Mr. Breckon 
at all; but she seemed to want to talk of Ellen; she 
was always asking about her, and what was the 
matter with her, and how long she had been sick. 

"Boyne," said his mother, with a pang, "you 
didn 't tell her anything about Ellen?" 

"Momma!" said the boy, in such evident abhor 
rence of the idea that she rested tranquil concerning 
it. She paid little attention to what Boyne told 
her otherwise of the Rasmiths. Her own horizons 
were so limited that she could not have brought 
home to herself within them that wandering life 
the Rasmiths led from climate to climate and sen 
sation to sensation, with no stay so long as they 
annually made in New York, where they sometimes 
passed months enough to establish themselves in 
giving and taking tea in a circle of kindred nomads. 
She conjectured as ignorantly as Boyne himself that 



 

they were very rich, and it would not have enlight 
ened her to know that the mother was the widow of 
a California politician, whom she had married in 
the sort of middle period following upon her less 
mortuary survival of Miss Easinith 's father, whose 
name was not Easmith. 

What Mrs. Kenton divined was that they had 
wanted to get Breckon, and that so far as con 
cerned her own interest in him they had wanted 
to get him away from Ellen. In her innermost self- 
confidences she did not permit herself the notion 
that Ellen had any right to him; but still it was 
a relief to have them off the ship, and to have 
him left. Of all the witnesses of the fact, she alone 
did not find it awkward. Breckon himself found
