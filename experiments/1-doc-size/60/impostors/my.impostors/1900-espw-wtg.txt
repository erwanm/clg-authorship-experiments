MRS. FAYTH (quickly). She thinks of nothing but you ... all the time.

DR. THORNE (eagerly). How do you know? Have you been there? Can you
see Helen?

MRS. FAYTH (mysteriously smiling). Don’t ask me!...

DR. THORNE (imperiously). When was it? How did you get there? How did
she look?--Is she well?--Did she look very wretched? Were her lips pale?
Or only her cheeks? Does she weep much? Can she sleep?--Is she living
quite alone?--Oh, how does she bear it? (He trips upon his words, and
stops abruptly.)

(A strain from the Serenade breathes, and sighs away.)

MRS. FAYTH (gently but evasively). My poor friend!

(DR. THORNE and MRS. FAYTH unclasp hands, and stand side by side,
silently in the moonlight. A certain remoteness overtakes their manner.
Each is drowned in thought in which the other has no share. The Serenade
is heard again. MRS. FAYTH, with a mute, sweet gesture of farewell,
glides gravely away. DR. THORNE does not seek to detain her.)

       [Exit MRS. FAYTH.

(The Serenade plays on steadily.)

DR. THORNE (puts his hands to his ears, as if to shut out the music,
which falls very faintly as he speaks). Between herself and me the
awful gates of death have shut. To pass them--though I would die again
to do it--to pass them for one hour, for one moment, for love’s sake,
for grief’s sake--or for pity’s own--I am forbidden. (Breaks off.) ...
Her forgiveness! Her forgiveness! The longing for it gnaws upon me....
Oh, her unfathomable tenderness--passing the tenderness of women!--It
would lean out and take me back to itself, as her white arms took me to
her heart--when I came home--after a hard day’s work--tired out....
Helen! Helen!

(The music strengthens as he ceases to speak; then faints again.)

DR. THORNE (moans). For very longing for her, I would fain forget
her.... No! No! No! (Starts.) Never would I forget her! To all
eternity would I think of her and suffer, if I must, because I think of
her.... I ... love her ... so.

(The Serenade ceases slowly, and sighs away.)

(DR. THORNE stands with the moonlight on his face. It is rapt, and
carries a certain majesty.)

(Spirits pass. Some of them glance at him, with wonder and respect. No
one addresses him. He stands like a statue of strong and noble solitude.
He does not perceive the presence of any spirit.)

Enter The Child. (Runs to his father.
Springs into his arms.)

THE CHILD. Lonesome, Papa? I will comfort you.
