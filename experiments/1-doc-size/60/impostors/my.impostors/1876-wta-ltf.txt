“I am sorry, Lilian.”

“Do you think I am made of iron?”

“Shall I go for Dr. Ingoldson?”

“I do not need a doctor so much as I need peace.”

“We both need that.”

“Are you going to drive me into that hateful house?”

“Certainly not, Lilian.”

“Did you write that cruel note which came this morning, Paley? I cannot
believe it.”

“I did write it, Lilian; but if you are sick we will not talk about
that,” I replied, tenderly, but firmly.

“But we must talk about it. Do you mean to say that you will print that
horrid advertisement?”

“Most certainly I shall, if you persist in your present course. It is
not right for me to support a wife who will not live with me. If you
are sick, we will defer all action until you are better.”

“I am not well, but I wanted to see you about this awful business. Have
you ceased to love me, Paley?”

“No, Lilian.”

Perhaps Mrs. Oliphant had tried to stay down stairs, and permit her
daughter to pour out her griefs to me alone; but if she had tried, she
had not succeeded; and at this stage of the interview she entered the
room, without the ceremony of knocking.

“I am glad you have come, Paley, for we want to talk over this
disagreeable business.”

“Lilian’s note informed me that she was sick, and I came to see her,
but not to talk over any matter. If she is ill—”

“She isn’t very ill,” interposed Mrs. Oliphant.

I thought not; at least not too ill to discuss the exciting topic.

“I am glad she is not very ill. If she is, I will stay at her side and
do all that a husband should do for a sick wife.”

“O, we can take care of her! But I wanted to ask you if you really
intended to put that advertisement into the newspapers?”

“You will excuse me, but I have nothing to say on that subject beyond
what I expressed in my note. If Lilian does not need any assistance
from me, I will go. If Lilian is ill, I will defer the insertion of the
advertisement until Monday morning.”

“O, Paley!” gasped Lilian.
