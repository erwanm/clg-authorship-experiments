Buckstone took the oath, and then testified that 
on the previous evening the Count Angelo Capello 
had protested against going to the hall, and had 
called all present to witness that he was going by 
compulsion and would not go if he could help him- 
self. Also, that the Count Luigi had replied sharply 
that he would go, just the same, and that he, Count 
Luigi, would see to that himself. Also, that upon 
Count Angelo's complaining about being kept on his 
legs so long, Count Luigi retorted with apparent 
surprise, " Your legs! â€” I like your impudence!" 

"Now we are getting at the kernel of the thing," 
observed the Judge, with grave and earnest satisfac- 
tion. "It looks as if the Count Luigi was in pos- 
session of the battery at the time of the assault." 

Nothing further was elicited from Mr. Buckstone 
on direct examination. Mr. Wilson took the witness. 

"Mr. Buckstone, about what time was it that that 
conversation took place?" 

"Toward nine yesterday evening, sir." 

"Did you then proceed directly to the hall?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"How long did it take you to go there?" 

"Well, we walked; and as it was from the ex- 
treme edge of the town, and there was no hurry, I 
judge it took us about twenty minutes, maybe a, 
trifle more." 





 

"About what hour was the kick delivered?" 

"About thirteen minutes and a half to ten." 

"Admirable! You are a pattern witness, Mr. 
Buckstone. How did you happen to look at your 
watch at that particular moment?" 

"I always do it when I see an assault. It's likely 
I shall be called as a witness, and it's a good point 
to have." 

"It would be well if others were as thoughtful. 
Was anything said, between the conversation at my 
house and the assault, upon the detail which we are 
now examining into?"
