step without attracting attention. It's just grand!" 

Henry said, reproachfully: 

"Instead of pitying it, Joe, you talk as if — " 

"Talk as if what? I know one thing mighty 
certain: if you can fix me so I can eat for two and 
only have to stub toes for one, I ain't going to fool 
away no such chance just for sentiment." 

The twins were wet and tired, and they proceeded 
to undress without any preliminary remarks. The 
abundance of sleeve made the partnership coat hard 
to get off, for it was like skinning a tarantula ; but it

Luigi answered with indifference: 

"My friend, when I am in command of our body, 
I choose my apparel according to my own con- 
venience, as I have remarked more than several 
times already. When you are in command, I beg 
you will do as you please." 

Angelo was hurt, and the tears came into his 
eyes. There was gentle reproach in his voice, but 
not anger, when he replied: 

"Luigi, I often consult your wishes, but you
