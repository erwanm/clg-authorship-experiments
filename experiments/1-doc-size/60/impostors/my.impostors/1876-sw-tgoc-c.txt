ROLLO'S EXPERIMENT.


When people are just in the position, newly assumed, of these two, 
sixty hours of absence, it will be allowed, is a long time; and 
between Friday evening and Monday morning Dane could not 
make it shorter. Therefore nobody will be surprised that he made 
his appearance Monday morning in the breakfast room.

'You are early,' said Mr. Falkirk with an accent of some surprise, 
as he dropped his napkin and rose to take his guest's hand. Rollo 
picked up the napkin.

'It was necessary, if I meant to catch you at breakfast.'

'Wouldn't after breakfast do?'

'Well, no. I wanted a cup of coffee; and though no doubt my friend 
Mrs. Bywank would have supplied me later, I should have had to 
take it alone.'

'That is a very sensible way to get one's morning coffee,' returned 
the growler.

'You do not seem to act upon your principles.'

'I have a charge on my mind, you see. My coffee, if Gotham gave 
it to me, would always he flavoured with something worse than 
grounds. So I come here to get it clear. Have you brought 
business?'

'Not for you, sir, to-day.'

'Enough of your own in the Hollow by this time, haven't you?'

'Not so much but that I mean to have more.'

'More business?'

'If I can.'Then he asked Hazel how she did?

Hazel recollected in time that it would not be true to say that she 
felt "more like herself" to-day, and changed that form of reply into 
a demure 'Pretty well, I think.'

'Pretty well, I think,' Mr. Falkirk echoed. 'Nobody but one who has 
tried it can tell what it is to have the care of a witch. I have been 
trying for a week, Rollo, to discover when we are to go to town, 
and whether I am expected to secure a house; and it is past my 
power to find out, the one or the other.'

'You do not like Chickaree?' Rollo inquired with matter-of-fact 
composure.

'She don't, in winter.' It is to be remarked, that the elder guardian, 
completely thrown off his suspicions by the course of the past 
winter and summer, supposed himself indulging in safe 
pleasantries with the only one almost with whom he could venture 
them.
