in his arms, a helpless baby, and he should owe no kindness 
to a stranger that he could perform for him. 

There was no change that morning. The storm meanwhile 
had subsided into a slow drizzle. Doctor Willard looked in 
again at noon. 

"I'll come and stay to-night," he said. "I have no im 
portant cases on hand." For he saw something in the tense 
lines that seemed to indicate a crisis. 

To both Anah and her son the day was intolerably long, 
broken late in the afternoon by a few calls. It is so hard to 



 

sit by in utter helplessness and see any human, life drifting 
out, without reaching forth a hand to stem the current. But 
Dr. Willard, in his shrewd, practical way, would not have the 
old man tortured for so vague and slight a chance. 

All the change that was to come for many days occurred 
that evening. John Hurst opened his eyes, began to breathe 
more naturally, took a little nourishment ; but lay there like a 
log, unable to stir hand or foot 

"There's a good deal of grit in him yet," said the Doctor, 
grimly. " No one can tell how it will end." 

The next day Victor Hurst went back to his old employ

ledge of receding brows ; coarse, heavy jaws ; hesitating and 
awkward in speech, until roused by the very excess of emotion, 
to them the figure lying there, so gray and wan, motionless 
as if already dead, had but one meaning. Some of the 
women began to sob hysterically. 

" He come to me one day last winter, "when we were freezin' 
and starvin', my man helpless in the bed, and not so much as 
a sup o' tea to wet his lips with. I'll never forget it, never ! 
He run out again and brought us some food, and took the 
poor babby in his own arms and give it a drink of milk, and 
made up a fire. And poor Rob went safe at the last I never 
heerd such prayers, never ! I'm sure heaven must be for the 
likes of him." 

"An' I shan't forget when poor Mary died," confessed an 
nncouth fellow outside the door, brushing his rough sleeve 
across his eyes. "In the old country she'd had the priest, but 
I wouldn't hear to it when she married me. We'd gone from
