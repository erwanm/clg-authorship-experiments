"There was no need of that, papa," said Antoinette, who was going to be a 
dumpy. 

"What has Mrs. Mowbray done to you? I really hardly know you again." 

"Fine feathers, papa." 

"Mrs. Mowbray has been very kind to me," Rotha managed to get in quietly. 

"She's growing handsome, wife!" Mr. Busby declared as he took his seat at 
the table. 

"You shouldn't say such things to young girls, Mr. Busby," said his wife 
reprovingly. 

"Shouldn't I? Why not? It is expected that they will hear enough of that

Which remark seemed to Rotha peculiarly unlucky for her just that day. 
Mrs. Busby reddened with displeasure though she held her tongue. 
Antoinette was not capable of such forbearance. 

"Papa!" she said, breaking out into tears, "that is very unkind of you!" 

"Well, don't snivel," said her father. "You are pretty enough, if you 
keep a smooth face; but don't you suppose there are other people in the 
world handsomer? Be sensible." 

"It is difficult not to be hurt, Mr. Busby," said his wife, pressing her 
lips together. 

"Mamma!" cried Antoinette in a very injured tone, "he called me
