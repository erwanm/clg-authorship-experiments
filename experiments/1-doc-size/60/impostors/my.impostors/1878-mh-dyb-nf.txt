MÉLANGE SOUP.

  1 cup of rice (scant).
  3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef.
  Some mutton bones.
  2 carrots.
  2 turnips.
  1 onion.
  Essence of celery, two teaspoonfuls.
  Pepper and salt.
  4 quarts of cold water.
  1 cup of tomato-juice.

Cut the meat into dice, and put on in the water. Boil gently two hours,
when add the rice, tomato-juice, and the vegetables cut into small
squares, and already cooked five minutes in hot water, to take off
the rank taste. Stew half an hour, or until the vegetables and rice
are tender, but not a pulp; season; boil up once and pour out—meat,
vegetables, and all—into the tureen.


Ragoût of Mutton.

  3 lbs. of mutton—lean and boneless—cut into strips four inches long
          by one inch wide.
  1 cup of gravy, made of bones, etc.
  A tablespoonful of walnut catsup.
  Browned flour.
  Salt and pepper.
  1 slice of lemon.
  Parsley.
  A slice of ham or fat pork, cut small.
  Dripping.

Fry the mutton to a nice brown, quickly, in the dripping. Lay in a
saucepan, the chopped ham upon it, and cover with the gravy, highly
seasoned. Stew slowly until very tender; take up, and keep hot, while
you add the lemon to the gravy, with the catsup. Boil five minutes;
strain, and return the gravy to the saucepan. Thicken, and put in the
parsley minced fine. Boil up, and pour over the meat in a flat dish.
Put sippets of fried bread around the edge of the dish.


CANNED CORN PUDDING.

  1 can of corn, drained.
  3 eggs.
