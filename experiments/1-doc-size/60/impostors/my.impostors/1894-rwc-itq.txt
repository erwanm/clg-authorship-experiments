head in her arms. He found her lying so when 
he returned, and, throwing down her traveling 
bag and rugs, he knelt and took her to his breast, 
kissing her again and again on the forehead. At 
last he had to speak. 

"I have packed the things you will need most, 
and will send the rest. It is getting light, dearest; you have to change your dress, you know." 

She roused herself and sat up, looking deso
