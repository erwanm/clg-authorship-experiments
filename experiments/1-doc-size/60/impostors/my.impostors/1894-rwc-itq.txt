"Oh, that tea!" she cried, "and not one bit 
of sugar. What a hopelessly careless man!" 

But Gethryn jumped up, crying, "Wait a mo 
ment!" and returned triumphantly with a huge 
mass of rock-candy, the remains of one of 
Clifford's abortive attempts at "rye-and-rock." 

They each broke off enough for their cups, 
and Gethryn, tasting his, declared the tea "de 
licious." Yvonne sat, chipping an egg and 
casting sidelong glances at Gethryn, which were 
always met and returned with interest 

"Yvonne, I want to tell you a secret." 

"What, Rex?" 

"I love you." 

"Oh!" 

"And you?" 

"No not at all!" cried the girl, shaking her 
pretty head. Presently she gave him a swift 
glance from beneath her drooping lashes, 



 

"Rex?" 

"What, Yvonne?" 

"I want to tell you a secret." 

"What, Yvonne?" 

"If you eat so many sardines " 

"Oh!" cried Gethryn, half angrily, but laugh 
ing, "you must pay for that!" 

"\Vhat?" she said, innocently, but jumped 
up and kept the table between him and herself. 

"You know!" he cried, chasing her into a 
corner. 

"We are two babies," she said, very red, 
following him back to the table. The pate was 
eaten in comparative quiet. 

"Now," she said, with great dignity, setting 
down her glass, "behave and get me some hot 
water." 

Gethryn meekly brought it.
