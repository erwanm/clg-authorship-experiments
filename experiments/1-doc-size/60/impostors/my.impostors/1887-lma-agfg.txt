head in various characters and pay for them.

She consented, and though much disappointed found some consolation
in hoarding a part of the handsome sum so earned for the desire of
her heart.

The artist seemed in no haste to finish his work, and for some weeks
came often to the sittings in that quiet room; for it grew more and
more attractive to him, and while he painted the younger sister’s
changeful face he studied the beautiful nature of the elder and
learned to love it. But no one guessed that secret for a long time;
and Jessie was so busy racking her brain for a way to earn more
money that she was as blind and deaf to much that went on before her
as if she had been a wooden dummy.

Suddenly, when she least expected it, help came, and in such a
delightful way that she long remembered the little episode with
girlish satisfaction. One day as she sat wearily waiting till the
dressing-room was cleared of maids and children after the
dancing-class was over, a former friend came sauntering up to her,
saying In the tone which always nettled Jessie,--

“You poor thing! aren’t you tired to death trying to teach these
stupid babies?”

“No; I love to dance, and we had new figures to-day. See! isn’t this
pretty?” and Jessie, who knew her own skill and loved to display it,
twirled away as lightly as if her feet were not aching with two
hours of hard work.

“Lovely! I do wish I ever could learn to keep time and not jerk and
bounce. Being plump is a dreadful trial,” sighed Fanny Fletcher, as
Jessie came back beaming and breathless.

“Perhaps I can teach you. I think of making this my profession since
I must do something. Mademoiselle earns heaps of money by it,” she
said, sitting down to rest, resolved not to be ashamed of her work
or to let Fanny pity her.

“I wish you COULD teach me, for I know I shall disgrace myself at
the Kirmess. You’ve heard about it, of course? So sorry you can’t
take a part, for it’s going to be great fun and very splendid. I am
in the Hungarian dance, and it’s one of the hardest; but the dress
is lovely, and I would be in it. Mamma is the matron of it; so I had
my way, though I know the girls don’t want me, and the boys make fun
of me. Just see if this isn’t the queerest step you ever beheld!”

Fanny started bravely across the wide smooth floor, with a stamp, a
slide, and a twirl which was certainly odd, but might have been
lively and graceful if she had not unfortunately been a very plump,
awkward girl, with no more elasticity than a feather-bed. Jessie
found it impossible not to laugh when Fanny ended her display with a
sprawl upon the floor, and sat rubbing her elbows in an attitude of
despair.

“I know that dance! It is the tzardas, and I can show you how it
should be done. Jump up and try it with me!” she said good-naturedly,
running to help her friend up, glad to have a partner of her own
size for once.
