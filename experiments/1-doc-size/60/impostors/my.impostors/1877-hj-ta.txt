Bellegarde laid his hand on his companion’s arm a moment, looked at
him with his head on one side, from head to foot, and then, with a loud
laugh, and shaking the other hand in the air, turned away. He walked
again the length of the room, and again he came back and stationed
himself in front of Newman. “All this is very interesting--it is very
curious. In what I said just now I was speaking, not for myself, but
for my tradition, my superstitions. For myself, really, your proposal
tickles me. It startled me at first, but the more I think of it the
more I see in it. It’s no use attempting to explain anything; you won’t
understand me. After all, I don’t see why you need; it’s no great loss.”

“Oh, if there is anything more to explain, try it! I want to proceed
with my eyes open. I will do my best to understand.”

“No,” said Bellegarde, “it’s disagreeable to me; I give it up. I liked
you the first time I saw you, and I will abide by that. It would be
quite odious for me to come talking to you as if I could patronize you.
I have told you before that I envy you; vous m’imposez, as we say. I
didn’t know you much until within five minutes. So we will let things
go, and I will say nothing to you that, if our positions were reversed,
you would not say to me.”

I do not know whether in renouncing the mysterious opportunity to which
he alluded, Bellegarde felt that he was doing something very generous.
If so, he was not rewarded; his generosity was not appreciated. Newman
quite failed to recognize the young Frenchman’s power to wound his
feelings, and he had now no sense of escaping or coming off easily.
He did not thank his companion even with a glance. “My eyes are open,
though,” he said, “so far as that you have practically told me that your
family and your friends will turn up their noses at me. I have never
thought much about the reasons that make it proper for people to turn up
their noses, and so I can only decide the question off-hand. Looking at
it in that way I can’t see anything in it. I simply think, if you want
to know, that I’m as good as the best. Who the best are, I don’t pretend
to say. I have never thought much about that either. To tell the
truth, I have always had rather a good opinion of myself; a man who is
successful can’t help it. But I will admit that I was conceited. What
I don’t say yes to is that I don’t stand high--as high as anyone else.
This is a line of speculation I should not have chosen, but you must
remember you began it yourself. I should never have dreamed that I was
on the defensive, or that I had to justify myself; but if your people
will have it so, I will do my best.”

“But you offered, a while ago, to make your court as we say, to my
mother and my brother.”

“Damn it!” cried Newman, “I want to be polite.”

“Good!” rejoined Bellegarde; “this will go far, it will be very
entertaining. Excuse my speaking of it in that cold-blooded fashion, but
the matter must, of necessity, be for me something of a spectacle. It’s
positively exciting. But apart from that I sympathize with you, and I
shall be actor, so far as I can, as well as spectator. You are a capital
fellow; I believe in you and I back you. The simple fact that you
appreciate my sister will serve as the proof I was asking for. All men
are equal--especially men of taste!”

“Do you think,” asked Newman presently, “that Madame de Cintré is
determined not to marry?”
