dark eyes wide and bright.

"Whom you please," quoth Nick, abashed but putting a bold face on
it--"well then, you please me, and therefore ought to kiss me----"

"No, I will not! John Drogue hath shown me what is my privilege in this
idle game of bussing which men seem so ready to play with me, whether I
