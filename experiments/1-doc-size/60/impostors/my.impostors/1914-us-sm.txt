and I heard the voice of Sylvia. "Mary, some- 
thing perfectly dreadful has happened!" 

"What?" I cried. 

"I can't tell you over the phone, but a certain 
person is furiously angry. Can I see you if I come 
down right away?" 



 



 

Such terrors as these were unguessed by me in 
the days of my obscurity. Uneasy lies the head 
that wears a crown â€” and mieasy, also, lies the 
wife of that head, and the best friend of the wife. 
I dismissed my stenographer, and spent ten or 
fifteen restless minutes imtil Sylvia appeared. 

Her story was quickly told. A couple of hours 
ago the acting-manager of Mr. van Tuiver's 
oflBce had telephoned to ask if he might call upon 
a matter of importance. He had come. Nat- 
urally, he had the most extreme reluctance to say 
anything which might seem to criticize the 
activities of Mr. van Tuiver's wife; but there was 
something in the account ia the newspapers 
which should be brought to her husband's atten- 
tion. The articles gave the names and locations 
of a mmiber of firms in whose factories it was 
alleged that Mrs. van Tuiver had found imsatis- 
factory conditions; and it happened that two of 
these fij-ms were located in premises which 
belonged to the van Tuiver Estates! 

A story coming very close to melodrama, I 
perceived. I sat, dismayed at what I had done. 
"Of course, dear girl," I said, at last, "you 
understand that I had no idea who owned these 
buildings." 

"Oh, don't say that!" exclaimed Sylvia. "I 
am the one who should have known!" 



 

Then for a long time I sat still and let her 
suffer. "Tenement sweat-shops! Little children 
in factories!" I heard her whisper. 

At last I put my hand on hers. "I tried to 
put it off for a while," I said. "But I knew it 
would have to come."
