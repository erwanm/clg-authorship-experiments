for the instant, as if she had received some 
sudden degradation. 

For her furs the pretty muff and collar, 
her mother 's Christmas present, which had 
matched and finished off her gray cassock so 
tastefully her furs were only squirrel. 

" I 'm going to have Astrakhan," said Jacque 
line (she had intended to have mink until this 
very minute) ; " that 's the latest, and they say 
another year mink will be all out." 

" That 's fortunate, for I 'm sure I shouldn't 
want yours just like mine," observed Maude 
Clare, with her peculiar smile. 

Gypsy, over in her corner, was thinking. 
If squirrel were "so common," and Maude 
Clare herself had said it, what should she 
do? At least she could go without; her 
mother would say it was a risk, when she had 
been used to them so many winters; but her 
mother would not know. 

Perhaps this, however natural, was a little 

cowardly. Was it not? However that might 



be, Jacqueline hit the unspoken thought with 
an unexpected thrust, 

" I don't see but I shall have to go without 
tny till holidays ; I wouldn't trust anybody 
else to chose Astrakhan for me, and Mrs. M. 
won't let me go to Boston ; she *s been as cross 
as a bear since she caught me in the cars 
with Ben Sizer. I 'm ashamed to go without, 
though ; it looks so poverty-stricken." 

"Which would you rather do, Maude, go 
without or wear squirrel?" asked Gypsy in an 
undertone, fingering Maude Clare 's tassel trim 
ming Maude always had rich trimmings 
in an uneasy, absent way. But Jacqueline 
heard the question. 

" I wouldn't be seen in squirrel a^how, H 
said she, with a little disdainful gesture of her 
pretty hands. 

Jane Bruce had been sitting by the window, 
so quietly that no one had noticed her. Con 
sequently every one started a little in surprise 
when she spoke suddenly and decidedly, 

Well, I would, if I couldn't afford anything 



nicer Of course, I 'd rather have an expensive 
and stylish thing; so would anybody; but I 
should feel degraded, I 'm sure I should, if I 
endangered my health all winter long rather 
than carry a squirrel muff ! " 

The girls had a liking, such as it was, for 
Jane Bruce ; she had a way of doing errands 
without grumbling, and curing their neuralgia, 
and being sorry for their headaches, a very 
quiet sort of way, to be sure, that nobody 
thought much about; but at any rate, they did 
not laugh at what she said. 

"Well, well," said Jo Courtis, "Jane doesn't 
care for the pomp and vanities, anyway, which 
makes a difference; do you, Jane?" 

The question was thoughtless, just like Jo. 
Gypsy glanced from her room-mate 's mourning 
dress to her face, on which a slight sadness had 
settled. Her good sense told her that Jane was 
right. It told her, moreover, that Gypsy 
Breynton was a little ashamed of herself. So 
she spoke up in her honest way, 

"Anybody want my sentiments on squirrel 



furs? Don t? What a pity! For you see, 
you 'll have to see me in them all winter. It 's 
either that, or worrying mother for fear I shall 
catch my death ; so you 'd better make up your 
minds to it. Jane, where 's the algebra lesson?" 

Jane was gone, as she was very apt to be ; 
and nobody thought any more about her. 

Not long after this, another matter came up, 
which troubled Gypsy more than anything of 
the kind had done before. 

One day three or four of the girls appeared 
with three or four little gold stars, all just alike, 
and all affixed by a tiny gold chain to their 
pins. They were inscribed with some mysteri 
ous hieroglyphics, which no one could decipher 
without coming to an impertinent nearness. 

"Why, what is it?" 

"Did you ever? 

" Where did they get them? " 

"What do they mean? " 

"What on earth do they keep it such a 
dreadful secret for?" 

So the whispers and the wonder buzzed 



around for a week, but the wearers kept their 
lips shut, and nobody was any the wiser. At 
last one day it was reported that the gold 
stars were the badges of a Secret Society, the 
Chapter of the Golden Crescent, solemnly 
founded in the trunk closet on the fifteenth 
of November, and solemnly to be handed 
down to posterity as long as time and Mrs. 
McMunn 's should endure. 

"Why, how splendid" said Gypsy. I 
doubt if Gypsy will ever outgrow her penchant 
for boy 's plays. 

Jo Courtis, Jacqueline Delancey, Mary Blunt, 
Lou Armstrong, and the Colchetts were the 
original members. There was a breathless sus 
pense in official circles. Would the illustri 
ous band enlarge itself? Who would be 
chosen next? 

One day Maude Clare walked into Shake 
speare, with the gold star hanging from her 
handsome lapis-lazuli pin. Maude Clare tried 
not to look important, and succeeded in looking 
it to perfection. 



As soon as the recitation was over, Gypsy 
flew after her, and begged leave to examine the 
badge. Upon one side was a cabalistic design, 




which might have been a toasting-fork, or a 
gravestone, or several other things. 

" Or a teaspoon, perhaps?" suggested Gypsy. 

"That 's telling," said Maude Clare. Upon 
the other side were the letters, 
handsomely engraved in German text. 



" E. S.? E. S.? What on earth does E. S 
stand for?" 

" Guess." 

" Well Everlasting Sinners? * 

" Guess again." 

Gypsy couldn't guess. 

" Evergreen Sisters." 

" Oh." 

" That is to say, that 's our public name. 
There is a private meaning, of course; we re 
on our oath not to tell that." 

Gypsy fingered the pretty trinket with wist 
ful eyes, but said nothing. 

In the afternoon Maude Clare came into 
her room with a very mysterious air; Jane 
Bruce, seeing that she was not wanted, went 
out. 

"You are elected, my dear," said Maude 
Clare, solemnly. 

"Elected?" 

" An Evergreen Sister. I am appointed a 
committee of one to notify you." 

Gypsy rose demurely from her chair, and 





jumped up and down three times, as hard as 
she could jump. 

"You had better go down town and order 
your badge this afternoon, I think," said Maude 
Clare. Gypsy stopped jumping. 

"How much does it cost? " she said, turning 
quickly round. 

" Oh, only five dollars." 

Only five dollars ! It might as well have 
been fifty. Gypsy walked over to the window. 
"Well?" said Maude Clare. 
Gypsy made no reply; perhaps she could 
not just then; she was bitterly disappointed, 
and stood with flushed cheeks, and one little 
pearl of a tooth biting sharply at her lip, think 
ing about it. She had five dollars in her purse, 
but it was nearly all owing to her washwoman. 
They would send her checks from home as 
often as she asked for them, but she very well 
knew that her mother had set apart an allow 
ance for the term, all that could be spared, 
which it would require close economy to come 
within. There was no twist or turn which 



Gypsy unpleasantly. For the first time, 
though only for a moment, she felt not quite 
satisfied with her " beautiful, darling, precious 
Maude Clare." 

" Tell them what you please," she said, and 
walked away. 

That night, just as she was growing sleepy, 
Jane Bruce heard somebody whispering. She 
could not understand a word, but if she had, 
this is what she would have heard. 

" I didn't, no, I did n t. I didn't come 
near it. I only thought about it I nearly bit 
my tongue off, too, I was so ashamed to think 
I did think about it. But then you know I 
didn't do it, and you see you don't know a 
thing about it, and you re not going to, either. 
No, ma 'am ! " 

It was Gypsy, talking to her mother. 

She chanced to be writing to Tom that 
night; as she could not well keep a secret 
from Tom, and feeling quite safe, she told him 
the story of the badge. " Just to fill up, you 
know. Of course it is all settled, and there 's 



no use in talking ab iut it now; but I thought 
you would like to hear. 

" I suppose I felt pretty badly standing up 
there at the window and telling Maude Clare I 
couldn't afford it; I was just such a little 
goose. But I might have worse things to feel 
badly about, mightn't I, you blessed old 
boy?" 



A few days after, a stout-looking letter came 
from New Haven. Gypsy opened it, wonder 
ing; and out dropped five dollars. Concern 
ing which, Tom had this to say: 

MY EVERGREEN SISTER, Run right down 
town and buy your badge. You needn't go to 
making up any of your horrible faces, for it 's 
all right A part of it is father 's New Year 's 
present, a little ahead of time. The rest I 
could spare just as well as not, and a little 
better. 

Who gave me all the cash she had, about 
the epoch of those Freshman scrapes? to say 
nothing of several other little things. If you 
don't remember, 

Yours respectfully, 

T. BREYNTON, does. 

Happy Gypsy, after writing just sixteen 
pages of protestations and thanks to Tom, to 
which he made answer only and characteristi 
cally, " You hush up ! " concluded that there 



It was nothing to be done but to order her badge 
and become an Evergreen Sister. Which she 
became, fifteen minutes after study-hours, on 
the very next Tuesday night. 

Now, if you would like to know, I think on 
the whole I will tell you, that this account of 
the Society of the Evergreen Sisters is not " a 
story," but true, every word of it. How I 
happen to know, is another matter; and it 
would be very inquisitive in you to ask; espe 
cially as I certainly should not say. I will 
simply observe that I did not have to apply 
to Gypsy for the info*. nation. 

It was time long ago for another chapter, 
but we really must stop for a glance at that 
eagerly expected Tuesday night. As the 
Evergreen Sisters long ago dissolved partner^ 
ship or, as Gypsy more classically expresses 
it, were " bounced up," nobody breaks any 
oaths in telling the tale. 

Tuesday night came as fast as other Tuesday 
nights, though it seemed leaden-footed to im 
patient Gypsy; and at a quarter of nine 
precisely, the Sisters assembled in Maude Clare 's 
room. They were all there, Maude, and 
Jacqueline, Jo Courtis, Lou, and Mary, and 
the Colchetts. " Poor Miss Holly " was there 
too. 

" Had to let her in," whispered Maude 
Clare. "Her room, you know; wouldn't 
budge an inch ; would insist on going to bed ; 
couldn't get it into her head that anything was 
up. What would you do, girls, if you 'd been 
made an owl? " 

After some whispering among the others, 
the two new members of the Society Susan 
Holly and Gypsy were put into a corner by 
themselves, on Maude 's large trunk. The 
lamps were turned down dimly; the curtains 
were drawn and pinned to the sills; the crack 
under the door, and the key-hole were stuffed 
with cotton wool. 

"When Mrs. M. comes round to put out 
lights, she 'll think that the inhabitants have 
gone to bed," explained Josephine. "Jack and 
I do that little thing whenever there 's a novel, 

or peanuts, or anything going on, and the 
woman never so much as knocks, doesn't 
want to disturb our sleep, bless her kind 
heart ! " 

Finally the register was shut, that the sound 
of their voices might not be carried to other 
rooms, and then Jo Courtis taking the chair 
that is to say, seating herself on Miss 
Holly 's study table, opened the meeting by 
announcing that the new members would now 
be initiated into the mysteries of the Ever 
green Sisters and the Chapter of the Golden 
Crescent. 

Upon that, somebody blindfolded Gypsy, 
and told her that she would first be required to 
kiss the Holy Archives of the Society, which 
she, reverently proceeding to do, splash ! went 
her head into a pail of very cold water. After 
that she was compelled to drink of the choice 
and ancient wine of the Society; and, if you 
know how water and sugar and salt, with a little 
Cayenne pepper and a touch of vinegar, taste, 
you will know how that tasted. After that 



there was a spirited endeavour to toss her in 
a blanket; but the blanket, unfortunately, was 
an old one, and Gypsy was heavy, and what 
should it do but split the whole length through 
the middle, and land Gypsy with such a noise 
on the floor, that Miss Ayre came running 
upstairs, and severely inquired through the key 
hole if anybody were hurt or crazy? After 
several other like exploits, of which the time 
faileth me to tell, Gypsy took her oath upon 
Webster 's Unabridged, to keep the secrets of 
the Society inviolate, and was pronounced 
with due form and ceremony an Evergreen 
Sister. 

Miss Holly had meantime been put through 
a similar process, and Josephine observed that 
they were ready to begin. 

"Begin to what?" asked Gypsy. "I sup 
posed we had come to the end." 

Maude Clare replied by throwing open the 
closet door, and disclosing to view her light- 
stand, neatly draped with a clean towel, and 
covered with I really do not know what 



not. Cakes, and turnovers, and pies, and 
lemons, and candy, and nuts, and all the indi 
gestible horrors that heart of school-girl could 
devise, to eat at ten o'clock at night. 

" And what does E. S. stand for, my dear?" 
asked one of the Colchetts. 

"Why, I suppose " 

" To be sure. Eating Society. Yes ; come, 
girls, I 'm dying for a chocolate cream." 

" But I suppose you have to pay for it," 
said Gypsy, looking up from her cocoanut 
cakes presently. 

" Oh, the tax is voluntary," said Maude 
Clare. "I give fifty cents a meeting; only 
once a fortnight, you know." 

Again, as happened so often, Gypsy felt a 
little check upon her merriment. It would 
seem mean to contribute less than the rest. 
But then, she must make up her mind to it; 
and perhaps Miss Holly would keep her 
company. 

The more poisonous a thing is to eat, and 
the more unearthly the hour of eating it, the 




fuller the room is of kerosene gas from the low 
burning lamps, the colder it is with the register 
shut off, the greater the risk of a teacher in the 
midst of them, and the deeper the mystery 
and excitement and hush and discomfort, the 
merrier girls will be. Very merry were the 
Evergreen Sisters; as for to-morrow 's head 
aches and dyspepsia and bad lessons and 
" blues " and crossness, if anybody thought of 
them, why, sufficient unto the day was the 
evil thereof; as Josephine said, if that wasn't 
a scriptural principle, she should like to know 
what was. 

Mrs. McMunn came her rounds before the 
lemonade was gone; found the cotton in the 
keyhole, and passed on, leaving the girls all in 
a heap in the closet, stuffing their handker 
chiefs into their mouths to keep from laughing. 

It was about half-past ten when Gypsy crept 
into bed over Jane Bruce 's feet, convinced that 
the Evergreen Sisters were a great success. 

One thing she did not feel quite at ease 
about, the little deception practised on Mrs. 




McMunn. She said so the next day to Maude 
Clare. Maude laughed at her, and called hei 
a particular child, but said that they should 
break up early after this. Mrs. McMunn had 
suspected that something was in the wind last 
night, and it was deemed advisable. The time 
between study-hours and ten o'clock was their 
own, and Gypsy felt no further scruples about 
being an Evergreen Sister. 

It was enough to break down the constitution 
of a giant, to be sure; but "girls will be 
girls," and I am only telling what happened. 

If, however, any poor victim stimulated to 
imitation should go and do likewise, I should 
repent having written this chapter, in dust and 
ashes, to the day of my death. 




AUDE CLARE had a box. 
The expressman had not rung 
the door-bell, before every 
body in the house, from 
Phoebe Hand on the lower 
floor, up to Jane Bruce in 
the attic, knew that Maude Clare had a box. 
Gypsy jumped and ran; Jane put away her 
books; Phcebe limped out into the hall; the 
whole second floor swarmed to the banisters, 
and peered over, a medley of eyes, ribbons, 
Waterfalls, curls, streamers, danglers, and 
whispers. 

" If it shouldrit be anything to eat ! " said 
Mary Blunt, who had been eating taffy all day, 



and shagbarks all yesterday, and Ladies drops 
all the day before, and something else every 
day since anybody could remember. 

" It looks like a bonnet." 

" Or a foot-tub, perhaps. * 

" Or books." 

"The idea of sending Maude books?" 

"Well, if it shouldn t!" sighed Mary. 

"Oh, Mary Blunt!" But Jo sighed when 
Mary sighed, and Jacqueline sighed when Jo 
sighed, and in fact Mary cared no more about 
it than the rest, except that she had the 
courage to say so. And if you should observe, 
after reading this book, that Gypsy 's school 
mates never did anything but eat, I should say 
that I really doubt if they ever did. 

Maude was hammering away at her box, and 
denting her pretty fingers on the nails, and the 
cover was coming off. 

"Apples?" 

The row of eyes over the banisters bright 
ened like a galaxy. 

" It isn't, either ! It 's only red strings to 



Maude 's winter bonnet ! " and the row of eyes 
over the banisters looked like a little thunder 
cloud. 

" Oh, it is too it is a plum cake and a 
bottle of pickles ! Girls, we never saw such a 
duck of a bonnet as Maude 's, did we? It 's the 
sweetest love in school, isn't it? " 

This came from Mary Blunt, and the rest 
flew after her down the stairs. Even Maude 
and nobody liked to have her pretty things ad 
mired better than Maude Clare was a little 
suspicious of the singular amount of interest 
that her bonnet excited. She went away up 
stairs with it rather haughtily, that is to say, 
as haughtily as she conveniently could, under 
the circumstances, for the box was heavy, and 
the nails stuck into her chin. 
" She isn't going to stand that ! " 
" Just like Maude ; she 's a stingy thing ! " 
" Gypsy Breynton, you go up after her! " 
Gypsy preferred to wait till she was sent for, 
and did so. Maude Clare called her up at last. 
Cake and pickles were nowhere to be seen; 




Maude stood before the glass, with the winter  
bonnet a rich velvet affair, which the light 
struck as it strikes a garment tied over her
