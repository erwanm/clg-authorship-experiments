In such a world there were no social calls, dainty lun- 
cheons, and exquisite garden parties. 

On the other hand, she held herself regally above any- 
thing but business. She had dwelt so long on the golden 
side that she understood class feeling and prejudice thor- 
oughly, and avoided all chance for slights or wounds, with 
the fine breeding of higher knowledge than mere rules. 
True, now and then, some overbearing customer had at- 
tempted insolence ; but it was checked by her brave and 
steady eye. Once the wife of a contractor who in a few 
years had amassed a fortune sent for her to consult about 
some orders she wished to give ; but Mrs. Marshall's an- 
swer was so to the point that, after fuming awhile over the 
extreme ignorance of business people, she descended upon 
her in all her state and majesty, and began with insuffer- 
able insolence. Mrs. Marshall listened to her harangue. 

" I think, Mrs. Chedister," she said in her clear, incisive 
voice, that seemed to cut as it went, " that I hardly care 
to number you among my customers. I shall probably 
not be able to suit you, and in a large city like New York 
there is a greater variety to choose from than it would pay 
me to keep. I am extremely busy, and have the honor of 
wishing you good-morning." 

Mrs. Marshall turned with the dignity of an empress, 
and left her lofty customer standing at the counter. 

" O Mrs. Marshall," cried one of the girls, " that was 
too good ! To think of Mrs. Chedister putting on so 
much magnificence, when she worked in a factory before 
die was married, and Mr. Chedister kept an oyster saloon. 





It is even said that she used to bake for the saloon lunches. 
Not that it hurt her, but she of all others has no right to 
despise labor." 

The story did get whispered about, much to Mrs. Ched- 
ister's discomfiture. 

On the other hand, Mrs. Marshall found herself making 
some really delightful friends, that she could not have met 
with in her old life. Mr. and Mrs. Bradford came fre- 
quently. They were plain, well-to-do people, with much 
general information, and that clean, strong, wholesome air 
so inspiriting. Mrs. Bradford was extremely fond of chil- 
dren, and took a great fancy to the two younger ones, 
Celia being much engrossed with her studies, and her own 
fairy dreams. 

There was one other person who had touched Eleanor 
with that intuitive nearness born only in people capable 
of some of the highest strains of friendship; this was 
Mrs. Van Cleve. About her there was no question in 
Westwater. It was not merely wealth and honorable 
records ; there had been statesmen, a bishop or two, pro- 
fessors of note, savants who added some brilliant discov- 
eries and stamped solid truths into the literature of their 
own times. Its ladies, too, had been the peerless kind of 
women who are acknowledged queens without much heart- 
burning, their lovely and gracious superiority being a kind 
of birthmark. 

As Miss Parker predicted, she had been caught by the 
bonnet, which proved charmingly becoming ; she had also 
taken Celia's panel of purple violets on the white back- 
ground ; she had likewise heard a part of Eleanor's story ; 
but she had been interested in the woman herself. Per- 
haps if Eleanor had seemed to discern her interest and 
fanned the flame, she might have drawn back with a kind 
of delicate reserve ; but it was as if Mrs. Marshall said to 
her : " Your path lies among the lilies and roses of life, 
but mine is on the solid wayside turf, with here and there 



 

a daisy bloom." She fell into the habit of lingering. 
" You keep such exquisite flowers," she would say, " that 
I must sit and look at them a few moments, if you do not 
mind." She saw other glimpses as well ; the tender, 
gracious mother ; the fond, obedient daughter ; the gay, 
wilful little lad, with his arch, merry face ; the graceful, 
harmonious woman, moving about with no sharp angles, 
no jarring tones, and no weak lines, — no looking back to 
certain joys left behind, no vain endeavors to make peo- 
ple understand that they had been there, that she be- 
longed to another sphere and had stepped out of it, but 
still clung to its faded glories. 

With a fine, subtile undercurrent of knowledge, Eleanor 
saw this, — saw but made no sign. If fate had been kinder, 
how she could enjoy such a friendship ; and, measuring 
herself by this other woman, she is amazed at all the 
forces that have been busy with her nature, changing it 
so slowly but surely, until she feels that she has left far 
behind the bright, joyous, hopeful, gay girl who married 
Thomas Marshall, and not only that, but gave him her 
heart's love. She is frightened to think that the woman 
of to-day would not marry him even if he could go back 
to the old life, and become what he was then. 




The full moon glorified the streets of Westwater, the 
last week in June, dimming the lights in store windows. 
What it did for the suburbs with the wealth of trees, the 
sweetness of great gardens, the picturesque aspect of 
grand old houses, or the points of beauty of the more 
modern ones with balconies and turrets and hanging win- 
dows, out of which a Juliet might have leaned, one had 
to see to appreciate. These old streets were filled with 
strollers ; taking moonlight walks was quite a fashion. 

Celia Marshall was in the back room, the table spread 
with her examination papers ; the two younger children 
had gone to a kind of garden party given by their Sun- 
day-school teacher ; Mrs. Marshall sat in the little recess 
behind the cretonne curtain, busy as usual, devising some- 
thing new for seaside hats, which were now being inquired 
for. Early in the week, few customers appeared in the 
evening. To-night the cream gardens and such places 
were full. 

A shuffling step startled Eleanor, and she glanced up to 
see a man slowly entering the store. For a moment her 
heart stood still, then it gave a great bound. She rose 
and went out with a sad, cold dignity. 

"Well, El'nor!" 

Her quick glance took in her husband from head to 
foot. He was not in rags, but he had a slovenly, dirty 
appearance, missing a woman's untiring hand. He was 
thinner and there were hollows under his eyes. He had 
aged five years, it seemed to her, in these three months. 

The lack of home comforts and regular living had begun 
to tell npon him, even in this brief space. He was not 
much in liquor, for an excellent reason, — he had no money. 

" Well ? " in a tone of clear inquiry, while she began 
to quiet her throbbing pulses. 

There was a pause of awkward silence. A faint flush 
of shame rose to the husband's brow, then he mentally 
shook together the sort of brute courage with which a 
man braces up a known wrong. 

" I 've come back to you — " twisting his greasy coat 
lappel. 

" The time of your probation has not expired. I said 
six months of soberness." 

" See here, El'nor — " he came and leaned on the coun- 
ter and dropped his voice, "this foolery's got to stop, 
you know. You had no right to turn me out of house 
and home — " 

"If I remember," she interrupted, " it was Mrs. Beach. 
I found a shelter for myself and my children, when I saw 
that you were not likely to; but I did give you the 
opportunity. This is my home. During the past three 
months you have had a still better chance, for you have 
had no children to support. Have you made a home for 
me, for them ? " 

He winced under her clear, searching eyes. She was a 
strong antagonist, and he inwardly cursed her. 

" Chance ! " with a kind of a whining sniffle. " What 
sort of a chance has a man, I would like to know, when a 
wife goes off and leaves him and takes his children and 
everything? I have some rights, as you will find out. 
There 's furniture here belonging to me, you are my wife, 
and here I stay. You'll find that I'm able to bluff your 
little game of divorce, and your fun with some other 

fellow." 

" I told you there was to be no divorce, unless you 
compel me to take such a step ; but I have invoked the 





protection of the law thus far, — you have no right to 
enter this place, you have no claim upon my earnings." 

She drew a long, steady breath, which gave her a kind 
of mental bracing. Now that the interview she had 
feared so long had indeed come, she must meet it with 
resolution. 

"We'll see," he returned with an oath. 

" Will you go quietly away from here, or must I call 
help ? When you claim anything, I want you to remem- 
ber that the last articles bought with your money were 
left with you. The few I kept I had earned. Others 
were sold from time to time as our needs required. There 
is nothing here of yours." 

" My boy is here. Where is he ? I shall see him," and 
he started towards the door. 

Eleanor placed herself in his way. "The child has 
gone to a little party. How much you care for him is 
evident from the fact that but for me he might starve, 
or have to find some asylum. Fortunately I can be 
protected in earning their bread. Oh, shame, that you 
their father, must needs make my mother's duties harder! " 

"Very fine sentiment, El'nor, very fine sentiment, but 
here I stick," and he dropped into a chair. " No sense in 
a man's wife rollin' in luxury and he a beggar. Kate 
said so. Guy ! There 's spunk for you ! " with a retro- 
spective chuckle. 

A customer came in, and Eleanor waited upon her in a 
mood of desperation. What must she do? To rouse 
Tom to oaths and perhaps violence would be too terrible. 
A brawl on a public street this peaceful summer night ! 

She stepped into the other room. " Celia," she said in 
a hurried whisper, " fly around to Mr. Bradford's and beg 
them both to come at once. Your father is here, — " oh, 
poor child, she knew by the flush what a cruel stab it was. 
" Run out of the hall." 

She came back and took up some white lawn she was 



 

shirring. What was in the man's mind as he looked upon 
the swift, slender fingers he had kissed so often ? Nothing 
but a dull, stupid vacuity, a feeling that here was comfort 
and here he meant to stay. Kate said Eleanor had no 
right to turn him out of a home. His mother felt that 
she might have been a better wife. She had turned 
against him in his years of bad luck, and now she had 
gone off to make a lady of herself. She would see. 

Neither spoke a word. Like a travesty, some scenes of 
their courtship came up before her. He had made him- 
self the dull, sodden being he was, wilfully, selfishly. Sup- 
pose she had done the same thing ? Was God a respecter 
of persons rather than principles, virtues, and actions ? 

Under any other circumstances the utter silence would 
have been dreadful. His head drooped sleepily, his lower 
lip hung down, displaying the even but neglected teeth. 
A silly, indolent, vapid expression lined every feature. 
What came into her mind with a sharp sense of humor — 
that God had made man upright, but he sought out many 
inventions ; many, many soul-destroying ones. Then she 
wondered if God had bestowed enough strength upon 
Thomas Marshall to enable him to save himself from this 
horrible destruction! If not, whose fault was it? He 
had not been pushed down this blind, seething gulf ; he 
had gone there deliberately, knowing better. She could 
not doubt God. She had not yet reached the point of 
despair where such a thing was possible, and her life had 
been too actively busy for abstruse speculations. 

Mr. and Mrs. Bradford entered, and the gentleman 
gave a quick, inquiring glance. Eleanor rose and ap- 
proached her husband. 

"Tom," she said gently, as one sometimes does to a 
fractious child, "I am not alone and friendless, as you 
may have imagined. I ask you now to go quietly, since 
leave this place you must," and she gave a meaning 
glance toward the new comers. 





"I won't," he replied doggedly. 

She raised her voice a trifle this time, as she repeated 
her request. 

Some confused thoughts had been struggling through 
his turgid brain. Here was the key to her sudden acces- 
sion of fortune and independence. He rose and glared 
at the man, and then opened such a volley of vile lan- 
guage and accusation that Eleanor turned ashen pale, and 
swayed as if she would have fallen. 

Mr. Bradford measured his antagonist with a sweep of 
the eye, and in another instant had swung him round by 
the collar, marched him through the store under the 
same impetus, and had him out on the sidewalk, nearly 
strangled. 

" Stop your vile lies," he commanded in a deep, stern 
tone. " Not another word, or I will give you in charge 
of an officer, and if you are found here again, that will be 
your fate in any event. Come, no one is afraid of your 
drunken bluster." 

He hurried him directly across the street, the better to 
distract any chance attention, and now turned him down 
a business street mostly shops and factories. 

" She 's my wife," whined Marshall in a choked voice. 

" She is not your wife to be bullied and tormented when 
you are full of liquor. Don't you dare molest her again 
or you 'll have a month or two in jail to consider what a 
fool you were. She has friends on the right hand and the 
left. Now go ; do you hear ? " 

Marshall stood cowardly abject. Then, as Bradford 
turned, he cried : — 

" Oh, for God's sake give me a quarter to get a night's 
lodging. It 's awful hard lines for me ! " 

Bradford gave him the quarter in pitying disgust. He 
shambled along, still dizzy with the tremendous whirl, and 
a stomach empty of food that day. Two men coming be- 
tween, he followed Marshall in their shade. It was as he 



 

suspected. At the very first saloon he stopped for a glass 
of whiskey. Tom Marshall fallen so low as to beg of a 
stranger, with a common drunkard's lie in his mouth ! 

Bradford returned to the store. Mrs. Marshall had 
been weeping in Mrs. Bradford's arms, and the motherly 
woman was doing her best to soothe and tranquillize her, 
but the shame was bitter to bear. 

"The policeman on this beat shall be warned," Mr. 
Bradford said decisively. " There must be no more such 
invasions. I am so glad you sent for us, my dear Mrs. 
Marshall." 

" You are so kind." A great, dry sob tore its way up 
with a force that made her shudder. " But I meant — 
oh, if I knew whether he had any — any money. Where 
will he go ! " 

"Do not distress yourself; he is not worthy of the 
thought of a woman like you. He begged a quarter of 
me for a night's lodging, and I followed him far enough 
to see him spend it for rum. There is no use of even 
pitying such a man ; and Thomas Marshall has the least 
excuse of any man I know." 

Eleanor's face was scarlet. The last remnant of wifely 
love received its death-blow. Even the nightly prayers 
seemed a mockery after that. 

Tom made another effort to be foiled by the guardian 
of the peace. His state was, indeed, at a low ebb. He 
worked a little, begged, tramped, and at last found him- 
left at Long Branch, where he sent a letter to his mother, 
imploring her aid to help him out West, where he might 
begin a new life. Eleanor had turned him off completely, 
and the imprecations he called down upon her were 
horrible to the mother. 

"There must be an end put to this," declared Mrs. 
Vanduyne, " or Tom will kill us both ; but, perhaps, as 
well that as some shocking scandal with Eleanor. What 
a fool he was to marry that woman ! Don't cry, mother; 





I will think up something. It would never do to give him 
the money to go away, he would be sure to spend it for 
drink. If I could get a pass." 

After two or three days, through which she managed to 
keep Tom out of sight, by providing him with a cheap 
boarding-place, her plans matured. She had a friend, a 
railroad magnate, to whom she confided part of her diffi- 
culty ; making Tom more sinned against than sinning, in 
the recital of his misfortunes. He was to be provided with 
a pass to St. Louis and a certain number of meals, but an 
extremely small allowance of pocket money. An employee 
going through was to have charge of him. There Eate 
would pay his board a month in advance, and, thus pro- 
vided with a home, he must earn the rest himself. 

Truth to tell, Tom Marshall made no demur, and was 
ready to start at once. There was no leave-taking be- 
tween him and his mother. Katharine's was curt and cold. 

"Tom," she said with her most impressive dignity, 
" never venture back to any of us unless you can come like 
a man. Tou are a shame and a disgrace to any family.' 

And so Thomas Marshall went his way. Four months 
had sufficed to wear out the patience of the sister, to chill 
the love of the mother. Were they not women with 
women's duties, as well as Eleanor? 

Celia Marshall comforted her mother with a tender 
sweetness beyond her years. In truth, the burdens of 
womanhood had been early laid upon her. In comparison 
with Daisy, she seemed quite grown up. In strength, 
fervent love, and clear, high courage, she was her mother's 
friend. They came closely together this sad night, and 
never after drifted apart. 

She passed a successful examination. In the autumn 
she would begin her three years' course at the high school. 
There was a secret pride in this, for she could not but see 
that it gave her position and a certain kind of power. 
And now she had time for her fascinating dream. 



 

After Fourth of July, business was dull, but did not 
entirely cease. There were festivities where gay little 
garden hats were all the rage ; there were people who had 
waited in the hope of getting much beauty for a small 
price ; there were the tired mothers of families who had 
to put themselves off until the very last. Miss Parker 
took her six weeks' vacation up in the Caatskills, where 
her brother was a farmer. The two other hands were dis- 
missed for the present, and only the apprentice retained, 
who was given one or two days each week. 

Celia had found that the sister of one of her school- 
mates gave lessons in painting. She began with water 
colors, flowers mostly, but soon indulged in bits of land- 
scape at home. Now and then she took the children out 
for a holiday, and Mrs. Bradford carried Daisy off to her 
eldest daughter's for a week, where there was a delightful 
farm and three little tots that were a never-failing source 
of amusement. 

About the middle of August Mrs. Marshall went over 
her business accounts. The summer stock had been pretty 
closely used, and not much remained on hand, except rib- 
bons and laces. Their living had been conducted most 
economically, for she felt she had no right to indulge in 
luxuries until she was out of debt. She found after all 
expenses of business and living were deducted she had 
cleared nearly three hundred dollars, and exceeded her 
most sanguine hopes. Part of the balance of Mr. How- 
arth's loan she had not touched at all. She resolved now 
to return the five hundred dollars, pay her six months' in- 
terest, and keep the remainder for current expenses and 
fall buying. 

She took her journey to New York, having apprised 
Mr. Howarth of her intentions. 

" I think you are allowing yourself too small a margin," 
he said with a quiet smile, when he had listened to her 





statement. " I should really like you to keep the money 
in case of an emergency." 

" I do not feel like paying interest on more money than 
I positively need," she returned with quiet dignity ; and 
the high, pure air indicated she could receive no favors. 

He understood at once. "At least," with a touch of 
pleading in his voice, " you will remember that you can 
call upon me at any time. I am warmly interested in 
your success, you must feel assured." 

"I do ; you have proved a true and generous friend. 
I could not have gained this vantage ground alone, but I 
feel certain now, with health, to be able to rear my chil- 
dren in a walk of life that will not shame them nor their 
mother." 

Ah, it would be doubly cruel to have one of them shame 
such a gracious and noble woman. And then he thought 
of the man who had dragged her to the very dust. 

He would not question her, but he wrote to Mr. Dar- 
row, who after a little search, found that Mr. Marshall 
had left the city. 

" If he will only stay away," he mused, with something 
like a prayer. 

September came in, filling the skies with gold and hazy 
reds, and the hillsides with tints of bronze and all the 
gradations of scarlet. The crisp winds, throbbing up from 
the sea, blew homeward the butterflies of fashion and the 
mothers of families, and the city was astir again with 
throngs of school children, young men whose ruddy faces 
bespoke exposure to sun and air, women who were many 
shades darker for their summer sojourn. The air was rife 
with hints of coming gayety. Several weddings were dis- 
cussed, a new opera house was to be opened with one of 
the famous singers. Afternoon teas were coming in, and 
there was a general air of pleasure. 

Mrs. Marshall took her place in the busy mart of labor 
with renewed courage. She would be able to make something 
more than a mere living. She liked the thought 
of a little breadth, of some leisure for reading with Celia, 
and becoming interested in all her pursuits. Daisy pro- 
mised to have a beautiful voice, and betrayed an unusual 
aptness for music beside the eager love children often 
possess. The piano at Mrs. Bradford's was her delight. 

" Oh, mamma, if she could only take lessons," exclaimed 
Celia earnestly. " It is such a comfort to do the thing 
you love, that fills your whole soul with longing." 

" We will see another year ; " and she put by the temp- 
tation for herself. Four years ago she had sold her piano ; 
it was too costly an article for poor people to move about, 
and she had not succeeded very well with music scholars, 
and her new neighborhood, she felt, would go still more 
against her. But oh, how many times her secret soul 
had cried out for some solace in the life growing harder 
and more common every year. 

Celia enjoyed her new class at school, and studied 
eagerly ; but she dreamed of something beside, — of a life 
that should engage every heart-throb, every aim. Teach- 
ing might do, if she could gain no other point ; but some- 
where in life she would make a stand for herself, and try 
with such courage that it must bring success. Painting 
flower-pictures was well enough just now, but there were 
higher meanings for pencil and brush. They looked 
quite out of her reach, but why should they be? Did 
not patient endeavor cover many purposes in life ? 

Miss Parker was as bright, cheery, and inspiriting as 
ever, and went at work with a wholesome zest. Orders 
multiplied. Mrs. Marshall was the style, undeniably. 
Perhaps one reason why she suited the richer classes so 
well was that she never duplicated anything especially 
pretty unless by request. If others copied, they could not 
attain the felicitous arrangement. She enjoyed her work 
so thoroughly. There was no wearisome spurring of com- 
pulsion. She did not dream of lost delights, of times 





when she had ridden around in Aunt Wilder's carriage, 
a happy girl with every luxury. 

In one way she was much relieved at her husband's 
continued absence, yet he was never wholly dismissed from 
her thoughts. The old love had perished, but it was suc- 
ceeded by something like a mother's longing care. She 
did not want to see him, but she was hungry to hear. 
Was he sheltered from the cold these bitter nights? 
Was he famishing for want of food? When she saw 
some poor soul thinly clad, she sent up a prayer for him ; 
when she gazed into a vapid, sodden, heavy-eyed face, 
she wondered ; and it seemed at times as if she must go 
out and search for him. How could she endure years of 
suspense? 

She could not have borne it if she had sat at home 
quietly eating out her heart. It is often woman's greatest 
misery that there is no active, entertaining work to do. 
And the drain upon her for the three busy months 
was so great that she really had not an idle moment, no 
time for morbid speculations, had she been so inclined. 

The last of January most of her bills had come in, and 
she found great cause for exultation. If not on the high 
road to wealth, she should soon be out of debt, and that 
meant having something of her very own. Ah, how 
precious it was! She could quite understand a young 
man's pride in his first few hundred dollars. 

She paid three hundred on her note. This time Mr.
