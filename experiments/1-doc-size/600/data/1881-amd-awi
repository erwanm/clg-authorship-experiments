" Can it be," he inquires, " that you have remembered 
Wilfred Carew all these years ? " And the pleasure of his 
tone would be a delicate flattery to any woman free to be 
charmed. 

" I was hardly likely to forget that part of my life," 
she says coldly. 

The die is cast and he must make the best of it, yet he 
feels less certain than a moment ago. Perhaps he has a 
foe to face, but he has conquered foes ere now. 

" Well?" He will compel her to show her hand. 

"Why did you come here?" she asks, for she feels 



 



 





assured that it was not hatred of Dolly that has called 
him thither. 

" Kismet,' he answers, in a soft, foreign-sounding pro- 
nunciation, lifting his delicately arched brows with the 
touch of audacity that appeals rather than offends. '' A 
chain of incidents opened the way, and I wanted to see 
you. Christmas, I was your friend in that solitary, re- 
pressed, misunderstood girlhood. There are many things 
that you cannot have forgotten." 

There is something inexpressibly sincere in his tone, 
and it does move her. 

" There are many things I never could forget." And she 
makes a gesture of bitter disdain. 

"Yet they were not my fault That a yiUain should 
have been the ruin of us all, I as a young lad could not 
help. My mother suffered intensely, bitterly, knew want 
and sorrow and regret. She often spoke of you. We 
never could hear aught concerning you, though we made 
some efforts. Then she died." 

Even that does not soften Miss Ormiston. She has 
come to look at Mrs. Treverton with the clear eyes of 
womanhood, whose sight has been trained by sincerity and 
invincible honor, and found her wanting in some of the 
most ordinary phases of character. She is the mother of 
this young man before her; and though Christmas was 
too young to distrust the woman's sweetness, experience 
has taught her much since that day. 

" Treverton was a villain ! " he says, in tones of deep, 
unforgiving resentment. " When the worst came out, my 
mother was compelled to fly with him. He drank, gam- 
bled ; indeed, I believe he is still in some notorious resort 
on the Continent. My poor mother did not long survive 
the shock. I took her maiden name Jeffries, which indeed 
had always been my own, for I wanted to break all con- 
nection with that wretch ! And nothing gave me greater 
joy than to know your fortunes had not been utterly 
wrecked." 



 



 



 

" It was owing to the wisdom and earnest endeayoro oi 
others that they were not." 

'' Mr. St. George," he says enthnsiastically, " is one of 
nature's noblemen, with all llie culture and* sincerity of 
true endeavor, and the purity of genius." 

A wavering flame seems to run over her face at this 
commendation, but the next instant it is calm and cold. 

Jeftries begins to experience the difficulty others have 
found, that Miss Ormiston is hard to get on with. 

(( Well," he begins again, with a kind of hopeful bright- 
ness, ''having confessed my sins, what remains? Can 
we not be friends as in the old times? I thought two 
nights ago that you had more than fulfilled one's highest 
dreams about you. I was wild to make some sign, some 
test. How well you hid your suspicions ! " 

Christmas Ormiston has to use all her force of will to 
resist this man's subtle fascination, that seems a perva- 
sive atmosphere about him. Not that she is in the slight- 
est danger of loving him, but he sways her so powerfully 
that she can hardly follow out her own consdiousness of 
right. 

'' You have not confessed aU your sins," she replies, 
with a breath-long conscious intensity that seems to wring 
her farthest pulses. 

"No," he answers with deprecating tenderness. "A 
man would confess to you every day, every hour, if he 
might, as one prays to angels. Only, not seeing the faces 
of the angels in the depths of solitary midnights, he 
might bewail sins that he could not set in the light of 
such a woman's eyes." 

The breath she draws cuts her like a knife. She makes 
a pitiful judge after all. 

" What are you to Dolly Allaire? " she asks briefly. 

"To Dolly Allaire?" There is a kind of innocent, 
doubtful, undecided light in his face that finally blends 
into amusement. " She is one of the charming products 



 



 





of society, and as the betrothed of Mr. St. Greorge I 
could be only a friend or tempter. And I doubt extremely 
if I would have the power to become the latter. Where 
would I be against fame and fortune? " he asks incredu- 
lously. " We have been compeers ; I met her some time 
ago. I had returned to America at the instance of some 
friends for a brief visit, and spent several weeks at New- 
port where her family were staying. Then I stumbled 
over them again at Paris. The world is not so wide after 
all, or else we go around in circles. And here we meet 
again." 

He watches her closely under his long lashes, that can 
shelter so much wariness. Can she be unconsciously 
jealous? For a moment he is mad enough to think she 
is beginning to care for him. He has a wild impulse to 
throw himself at her feet, but he is too wise to rush on to 
fate through unknown paths. 

" You have been engaged to Miss Allaire," she pursues, 
with a cold brevity that is so like a cover for resentment 
it blinds him. 

" A foolish child's play, long ago ! " he cries. " There 
was nothing in it." Then his face is sublimed with the 
white heat of passion, his lips quiver, his eyes droop and 
the long lids are tremulous, his voice has that full depth 
of emotion that invariably pierces a woman's soul to the 
quick. He bends over and snatches her hand, imprinting 
rapturous kisses upon it 

"I love you, you! The few fancies that have gone 
before are like a trail of snow that morning sun dissipates. 
My darling, whom I know now, I loved in childhood ; my 
soul, my very life, and all the dtrength and passion of a 
resolute manhood, are laid at your feet. Christmas, do you 
not remember my mother used to call you my little wife? 
I was your knight in those days, let me be the friend 
nearer and dearer — " 

" Stop I stop I " Christmas Ormiston springs up, shaken 



 



 



 

by intensest anger and horror, her face a blaze of scarlet 
fire, and her eyes two gleaming points of black. "You 
shall not say such things to me ! Even if you had the 
right of love, I could not listen, I could be nothing to 
you, but you add the blackest of treachery to the list. 
You are bound to Miss Allaire. You have some secret 
power over her. I must know what it is, for her sake, 
for—" 

" Well," he appends coolly, quite restored to his mar- 
vellous self-possession, which he can recover in an instant, 
"go on — for the sake of Leighton St. Greorge. For 
if it can be proven that Miss AUaure has kept back part 
of the price, her immaculate knight may be free to turn 
his attention elsewhere. You can be nothing to me, be- 
cause you long to be all to him." 

Until this moment the thought has not entered his mind, 
but the cruel shaft strikes home in the proud and sensi- 
tive soul, and he feels that he has wrested one weapon 
from his enemy. She stands stunned, ice cold, her face 
like marble, until some hidden consciousness, as new to 
her as to him, sends a passion of regret into her eyes. 

" I shall not demean myself to answer your taunt," 
she says clearly, knowing that she had never coveted, or 
dreamed such a thing possible. " And if you choose not 
to tell me, I can learn — " 

"Will you question Dolly in her sleep?" he asks 
mockingly. "I must advise you that you will hardly 
gain enough for your trouble. If you desire to drag your 
friend into an unwholesome scandal, you can even do 
that." 

"Will anything persuade you?" she cries desperately. 
"Can no inducement prevail? Why will you torment 
her?" 

"Twment her! That is good, excellent"; and he 
laughs with the keenest irony. " You have yet to learn, 
Miss Orxniston, that your friend is fashionably impervious 



 



 





to such a thing. A woman steeped to the lips in 
flirtations understands the art of intrigne better. She may be 
chagrined at some failure, but tormented ! " and he laughs
again. Then with sadden seriousness, ''There is one 
inducement. Let me have opportunity to win this fair 
hand, and Miss Allaire may go her way unmolested." 

'' If the tie does not bind you neither does it bind her," 
Christmas Ormiston insists bravely. 

'' Perhaps," a stinging sneer wreathes his lips, '' Miss 
Allaire burned her bridges behind her, trusting never to 
be compelled to return. The other party, more prudent, 
has kept his intact, in the shape of some extremely confidential letters." 

The man is a subtle fiend. Dolly she realizes is in his 
power, and yet Christmas feels that the chain sits lightly 
for the most part, that she is not troubled above measure. 
She can dance with a gay step, she can laugh clearly, she 
can sleep sweetly as an infant, and according to conmionly 
received beliefs her conscience would prevent repose of 
soul or body. 

Christmas Ormiston feels weary, worsted in the fray, 
and barren of victory. Her slender hands droop at her 
side, her whole attitude is one of depression. She turns 
with a sad, proud dignity. 

"At least," she says, with high inward courage, " your 
own good sense will keep you from intruding at Ormiston." 

The aplomb of the man is superb. He smiles indul- 
gently, and waves his hand with a benevolent gesture as 
if conferring a benefit. 

" Miss Ormiston, if you are wise, you will not attempt 
to disturb the harmonious adjustment of affairs at pres- 
ent," he says in a graciously advisory tone. '' There may 
be an accumulation of forces of which you know nothing, 
and your well-meant efforts may bring about destruction 
that you will regret. If Miss Allaire has taken you for 
her confidante, insist that she shall tell you aU the truth." 



 



 



 

ChristmaB Onniston tarns away without another wcnrd. 
Carew watches her stately step, her figure of supple con- 
tours and affluent lines, the hand slender yet with an im- 
Inressive strength. Who would hare imagined, when they 
were all flying from the disgraceful ruin of Onniston Mills, 
that it would rise from its mythical ashes so fair an in- 
heritance? He envies it with grasping bitterness, for 
every good thing in life is represented in his mind by the 
one possession, wealth. Businec& of any kind he shrinks 
from as a prison tread-mill. Leisure, ease, and luxury are 
his gods. He can dream away hours over a cigar, but it 
must be fine in flavor, and his eyes must have some ad- 
junct of nature or art to rest upon. There is a great deal 
of outward fineness and rare harmony, for he has cultivated 
the supersensuous side of his nature in all the respects 
that are so akin to purity and candor. Mountain, sea, 
and sky have for him a delight, the sweetness of balmy 
breezes, the mingling tints of bloom, golden sunsets — 
sunrise is rather too troublesome a pleasure. He is fond 
of fine broadcloth and exquisite linen, his dainty hands 
are trained to the nicest nervous touch, his eyes to soft, 
seductive, harmonious sights, his ears to the culture of 
sound that would do credit to a musician. He is desirous 
of pleasing, and he revels in being delicately ministered xo. 
The homage of rare, well-bred women delights him, while 
the coarse adulation simply disgusts. He could not marry 
and live with an uncongenial woman if she had the wealtJi 
of Indies ; in truth, marriage has a side that he does not 
wholly admire. 

He has made for himself a comfortable easy creed for 
this world. After going through many philosophies, for 
Carew has a strongly intellectual side, he has come to the 
conclusion that any other existence is extremely problenofc- 
atical. He judges a good deal from the people who do 
seem to believe in another life, for he finds them eager to 
lay up treasures here, anxious to taste the sweetness of 



 



 





every cnp, and deal out the dregs to others. He is no 
blatant infidel, for he does not consider it good form. He 
cannot quite agree with Hegel, for his whole existence is 
a matter of sensations, and he wants them delicious ; if 
he quietly ignores the Almighty with Comte, he has no 
desires for penance, and cares not to pray to any idea of 
beneficent humanity. He lives in the present, and for 
pleasurable sensations. 

That he has made mistakes and blunders before getting 
himself adjusted to this creed, he is well aware. That 
the creed alone, without money, cannot sustain him, he 
knows well enough. He has had some wonderful bits of 
luck or good fortune, but it would be quite as well to take 
advantage of any provident opening. He finds him- 
self well suited with Glen Ormiston. The years have 
brought it a beauty bom of careful good taste. As he 
walks up the ravine, the rich luxuriance mingles with a 
wild, picturesque strength. It is a fair domain, and 
would be extremely attractive to the kind of men and 
women in whom he delights. Coming to an open space 
on arising point, he looks down at the mellow, wide-spread- 
ing, comfortable house, that wears the air of benignant 
repose, the settled, steady enjoyment. Christmas, he is 
thankful to see, understands the spirit of the place, and 
has not made it the sort of meretricious casino-like open 
house for all shades and kinds. Yes, he likes Miss Ormis- 
ton's good sense and severe simplicity. The business is 
well managed now and profitable, and no woman in a 
solitary life needs such a fortune. Thus far he has never 
met with anything so near his ideal. What method will 
be likeliest to win her? Does she really care for St. 
Greorge? In that event, all possibility of ever winning 
him must be put out of her power. 

Christmas walks rapidly down to the house and goes 
straight to her room. Her soul is in a chaos of contending 
emotion. She would like to drop Dolly Allaire out of her life


and she sets herself to consider how it can be done. Helen 
her natural protector, and why should she not marry? 

The soul of the woman rises up in desperate protest. 
Can she endure the thought of the blurred and trivial 
existence that must be his? If Dolly were worthy, she 
would say no word, but it is the horrible sacrifice that 
appalls her. She looks at herself clear-eyed ; no, she has 
not been coveting him. There is no real humiliation in 
the thought, but she feels that his nature does not need 
hers in any of the fine, far-reaching ways that make mar- 
riage a sacrament, the intense and personal desire that 
corresponds with a man's loftiest ideals, and makes his 
love run in the channel with all that is best and purest in 
bothsookk 



 



 



CHAPTER XXll, 

CAN SHE BESOLYB THE TANOLE? 

It would seem that Dolly Allaire had in some way beem 
put on her guard, for she gives Miss Ormiston no moment 
for a confidence. Indeed, more guests are added the next 
day, and then Sunday intervenes. Jeffries walks over in 
the late afternoon with St. Creorge by his own invitation. 
Miss Allaire meets the old lover and the new one serenely. 
They ramble off to the ravine, and Miss Miller is enchanted 
with Mr. Jeffries, who makes himself a delightful centre 
in the conversation. He has willed to be fascinating, and 
attract these people without any appeal to his hostess. 
Mrs. Byrne asks him to remain to dinner, and some of the 
younger members of the group insist. He is amused at 
the juxtaposition, and accepts with the cordial grace of a 
gentleman. Christmas feels as if she were walking in her 
sleep. Everything about her is curiously unreal. She is 
in an atmosphere of mystery and duplicity, yet she «eems 
the only one affected by it. 

Later, Mr. Jeffries tries the organ at the earnest solici- 
tation of several of the guests. His repertoire is not very 
large, but extremely fine and well chosen, and not likely to 
be exhausted in an hour or two. Christmas is out on the 
veranda, and St. George joins her. 

"I am afraid I have been remiss," he says, in a half- 
apologizing tone. " But Mr. Stannard is really ill, and 
Mrs. Stannard is nervous about being alone." 

" I should think she would like Dolly to stay with her," 
Miss Ormiston remarks. 

"Dolly!" He smiles a little. 

"I think you are all acting wrongly with her," Miss Ormis- 




 

ton exclaims, in a voice she strives to render judicially clear. 
" It is time she began to entertain some serious views of 
life, and — of her duty to you. I wonder Mrs. Stannard 
does not feel that this is not quite the preparation for her 
future. And you are not altogether irresponsible." 

A sharp line defines the aoe between his eyes, which 
look resolutely out to vacancy. His lips close rather 
more firmly. If she does not see, some hidden ihflnence 
makes her feel these slight changes. 

" I am Miss Allaire's hostess," she resumes, when no 
comment is forthcoming, " but I cannot be her keeper, 
since you two have a nearer right. If she oversteps the 
strict limits of her engagement — " 

" I am afraid her engagement was not very strict " ; and 
he half smiles an instant, then is grave again. " Miss 
Ormiston," he begins with a sudden start, "how many 
engagements meet us on every side, entered into by 
many mixed motives, and so little real knowledge of the 
step into which we are plunging ! I have no right to 
justify myself, but I will say that when I spoke I was 
under the impression that Miss Allaire's deepest feelings 
were enlisted. When a man believes, even for a brief 
while, that he is loved, there seems an imperious duty, as 
if, having given opportunity for the affection, he has no 
right to pass by it, but every reason to gather it up and 
cherish it. Later, I fancied I might have been over-ocm- 
fident, over-hasty. Miss Allaire ought to have the privilege 
of learning whether she has made a mistake." 

There is no enthusiasm and no pain in his tone. He 
will do his dnty strictly, but is not the bond irksome 
already? She tries to keep the sympathetic pity out of 
her soul, she shuts her eyes to the irreparable misery he 
is infiicting upon himself, and steels her nerves, or fancies 
she does, to look calmly upon the end, which wUl be 
marriage. But can she utter no warning against Mr. 
Jeffries? 



 



 




A fine sense of hospitality prevents. The man has 
been a guest at her table ; he, St. Greorge, is perhaps an- 
swerable for his being here now. Besides, will the wwld 
blame him for wanting to be known as Carew Jeffries, 
rather Ihan Jeffries Carew? Mr. Treverton's guilt surdy 
does not cover him. The fine broad candor that is insep- 
arable from her nature will not punish the innocent for the 
guilty. 

" I have been frank with you," St. George continues. 
" I leave all in Miss Allaire's hands." 

She is thrown back then upon Dolly. When the guests 
are gone and the house quiet, she will compel her confi- 
dence, and there is resolution in the straight line of her 
brows. 

The hall clock tolls off ten with its measured stroke. 
Jeffries rises from the organ and bends gracefully over to 
Dolly, whispering,— 

"You are more generous with your lovers than in 
times past." 

She tosses her head, and he smiles inwardly. Hat 
Dolly Allaire's fire heat burned out to ashes? 

Presently he and St. George make their adieus together. 
The moon hangs out a faint sal in the line 
of luminous light down in the valley, changing to yellow 
in one small centre where her pale glory will soon emerge. 
The stars are soft gleams of opalescent tints, the air 
is rich in fragrant dews, but not damp, for a west wind 
wanders quiveringly, and makes suggestions of muito 
among the pines. 

If some super-conscientiousness has withheld Miss 
Ormiston from betrayal, no such delicate motive has a 
feather's weight with Mr. Jeffries when he resolves to 
move. Indeed, conscience with him is an unknown fac- 
tor. He has made up his mind that every art and device 
shall be bent to the purpose of winning Miss Ormiston. 
Putting together trifles light as air, he fancies there ave 



 



 



 

indications in the friendly indifference of these two people 
that might flame out into a sadden blaze. The time and 
the place favor a confidence. 

"Mr. St. George," he begins in the indescribable tone 
that at once indicates a confession, "my very soul 
reproaches me for a deception practised more particularly 
upon you, as it is really nothing to the rest of the world. 
Haying made amends to Miss Ormiston, I wish to explain 
to you — " 

St. George holds a long indrawn breath, in strange 
expectancy, but does not break the pause. 

"It is an awkward matter"; and he laughs with the 
utmost nicety of embarrassment. ''For reasons of a 
painful nature of more importance to me than to any one 
else, I some years ago transposed my name. It stood in 
my early boyhood as Wilfred Jeffries Carew." 

'' I believe it is quite unknown to me," is the somewhat 
grave answer. 

"My mother had the misfortune to marry Mr. Trever- 
ton." St. George starts in amaze at this. ''She was
