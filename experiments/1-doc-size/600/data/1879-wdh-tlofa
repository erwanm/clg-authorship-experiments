 

we was drivin' up to the depot, we met the same 
two young men, and the captain asked 'em, 'Are 
you goin' or not a-goin' ? ' — just that way; and 
they said, ' We 're goin'.' And he said, ' When 
you comin' aboard ? ' and he told 'em he was goin' 
to haul out this mornin' at three o'clock. And 
they asked what tug, and he told 'em, and they 
fixed it up between 'em all then that they was to 
come aboard from the tug, when she 'd got the ship 
outside ; and that 's what I suppose they did. The 
captain he said to me he hadn 't mentioned it be- 
fore, because he wa'n 't sure 't they 'd go till that 
minute. He give 'em a first-rate of a character." 

Miss Maria said nothing for a long while. The 
subject seemed one with which she did not feel 
herself able to grapple. She looked all about the 
kitchen for inspiration, and even cast a searching 
glance into the wood-shed. Suddenly she jumped 
from her chair, and ran to the open window : " Mr. 
Goodlow ! Mr. Goodlow ! I wish you 'd come in 
here a minute." 

She hurried to meet the minister at the front 
door, her father lagging after her with the infantile 
walk of an old man. 

Mr. Goodlow took off his straw hat as he mounted 
the stone step to the threshold, and said good- 
morning ; they did not shake hands. He wore a 
black alpaca coat, and waistcoat of farmer's satin ; 
his hat was dark straw, like Deacon Latham's, but 
it was low-crowned, and a line of ornamental open- 
work ran round it near the top. 



" Come into the settin'-room," said Miss Maria. 
" It 's cooler, in there." She lost no time in laying 
the case before the minister. She ended by say- 
ing, " Father, he don't feel just right about it, and 
I 'd know as I 'm quite clear in my own mind." 

The minister considered a while in silence before 
he said, " I think Lydia's influence upon those 
around her will be beneficial, whatever her situa- 
tion in life may be." 

" There, father ! " cried Miss Maria, in reproach- 
ful relief. 

"You're right, Maria, you 're right!" assented 
the old man, and they both waited for the minister 
to continue. 

" I rejoiced with you," he said, " when this op- 
portunity for Lydia's improvement offered, and I 
am not disposed to feel anxious as to the ways and 
means. Lydia is no fool. I have observed in her a 
dignity, a sort of authority, very remarkable in one 
of her years." 

" I guess the boys at the school down to the 
Mill Village found out she had authority enough," 
said Miss Maria, promptly materializing the idea. 

"Precisely," said Mr. Goodlow. 

" That 's what I told father, in the first place," 
said Miss Maria. " I guess Lyddy 'd know how to 
conduct herself wherever she was, — just the words 
I used." 

" I don't deny it, Maria, I don't deny it," 
shrilly piped the old man. " I ain't afraid of any 



 

harm comin' to Lycldy any more 'n what you be. 
But what I said was, Wouldn't she feel kind of 
strange, sort of lost, as you may say, among so 
many, and she the only one ? " 

" She will know how to adapt herself to circum- 
stances," said Mr. Goodlow. " I was conversing 
last summer with that Mrs. Bland who boarded at 
Mr. Parker's, and she told me that girls in Europe 
are brought up with no habits of self-reliance what- 
ever, and that young ladies are never seen on the 
streets alone in France and Italy." 

" Don't you think," asked Miss Maria, hesitat- 
ing to accept this ridiculous statement, " that Mrs. 
Bland exaggerated some ? " 

" She talked a great deal," admitted Mr. Good- 
low. " I should be sorry if Lydia ever lost any- 
thing of that native confidence of hers in her own 
judgment, and her ability to take care of herself 
under any circumstances, and I do not think she 
will. She never seemed conceited to me, but she 
was the most self-reliant girl I ever saw." 

" You 've hit it there, Mr. Goodlow. Such a 
spirit as she always had ! " sighed Miss Maria. 
" It was just so from the first. It used to go to my 
heart to see that little thing lookin' after herself, 
every way, and not askin' anybody's help, but just 
as quiet and proud about it ! She 's her mother, 
all over. And yest'day, when she set here waitin' 
for the stage, and it did seem as if I should have 
to give up, hearin' her sob, sob, sob, — why, Mr. 



 

Goodlow, she hadn 't any more idea of backin' out 
than — than " — Miss Maria relinquished the search 
for a comparison, and went into another room for a 
handkerchief. " I don 't believe she cared over and 
above about goin', from the start," said Miss Ma- 
ria, returning, " but when once she 'd made up her 
mind to it, there she was. I 'd know as she took 
much of a fancy to her aunt, but you couldn 't told 
from anything that Lyddy said. Now, if I have 
anything on my mind, I have to blat it right out, 
as you may say ; I can't seem to bear it a minute ; 
but Lyddy 's different. Well," concluded Miss Ma- 
ria, " I guess there ain't goin' to any harm come 
to her. But it did give me a kind of start, first off, 
when father up and got to feelin' sort of bad about 
it. I 'd know as I should thought much about it, if 
he hadn 't seemed to. I 'd know as I should ever 
thought about anything except her not havin' any 
one to advise with about her clothes. It 's the 
only thing she ain't handy with : she won't know 
what to wear. I 'm afraid she 'll spoil her silk. 
I 'd know but what father 's been hasty in not look- 
in' into things carefuller first. He most always does 
repent afterwards." 

" Couldn 't repent beforehand ! " retorted Deacon 
Latham. " And I tell you, Maria, I never saw a 
much finer man than Captain Jenness ; and the 
cabin 's everything I said it was, and more. Lyddy 
reg'larly went off over it ; 'n' I guess, as Mr. Good- 
low says, she 'll influence 'em for good. Don't you 



 

fret about her clothes any. You fitted her out in 
apple-pie order, and she 'll soon be there. 'T ain't 
but a little ways to Try-East, any way, to what it 
is some of them India voyages, Captain Jenness 
said. He had his own daughters out the last voy- 
age ; 'n' I guess he can tell Lyddy when it 's 
weather to wear her silk. I 'd know as I 'd better 
said anything about what I was thinkin'. I don't 
want to be noways rash, and yet I thought I 
couldn't be too partic'lar." 

For a silent moment Miss Maria looked sourly 
uncertain as to the usefulness of scruples that came 
so long after the fact. Then she said abruptly 
to Mr. Goodlow, " Was it you or Mr. Baldwin 
preached Mirandy Holcomb's fune'l sermon ? " 



VI. 

One of the advantages of the negative part as- 
signed to women in life is that they are seldom 
forced to commit themselves. They can, if they 
choose, remain perfectly passive while a great many 
things take place in regard to them ; they need not 
account for what they do not do. From time to 
time a man must show his hand, but save for one 
supreme exigency a woman need never show hers. 
She moves in mystery as long as she likes ; and 
mere reticence in her, if she is young and fair, in- 
terprets itself as good sense and good taste. 

Lydia was, by convention as well as by instinct, 
mistress of the situation when she came out to 
breakfast, and confronted the young men again 
with collected nerves, and a reserve which was per- 
haps a little too proud. The captain was there to 
introduce them, and presented first Mr. Dunham, 
the gentleman who had spoken to her grandfather 
on the wharf, and then Mr. Staniford, his friend 
and senior by some four or five years. They were 
both of the fair New England complexion ; but 
Dunham's eyes were blue, and Stamford's dark 
gray. Their mustaches were blonde, but Dun- 
ham's curled jauntily outward at the corners, and 
his light hair waved over either temple from the 



 

parting in the middle. Staniford's mustache was 
cut short ; his hair was clipped tight to his shapely 
head, and not parted at all ; he had a slightly aqui- 
line nose, with sensitive nostrils, showing the carti- 
lage ; his face was darkly freckled. They were both 
handsome fellows, and fittingly dressed in rough 
blue, which they wore like men with the habit of 
good clothes ; they made Lydia such bows as she 
had never seen before. Then the Captain intro- 
duced Mr. Watterson, the first officer, to all, and 
sat down, saying to Thomas, with a sort of guilty 
and embarrassed growl, " Ain't he out yet ? Well, 
we won't wait," and with but little change of tone 
asked a blessing ; for Captain Jenness in his way 
was a religious man. 

There was a sixth plate laid, but the captain 
made no further mention of the person who was not 
out yet till shortly after the coffee was poured, when 
the absentee appeared, hastily closing his state-room 
door behind him, and then waiting on foot, with a 
half-impudent, half-intimidated air, while Captain 
Jenness, with a sort of elaborate repressiveness, 
presented him as Mr. Hicks. He was a short and 
slight young man, with a small sandy mustache 
curling tightly in over his lip, floating reddish-blue 
eyes, and a deep dimple in his weak, slightly re- 
treating chin. He had an air at once amiable and 
baddish, with an expression, curiously blended, of 
monkey-like humor and spaniel-like apprehensive- 
ness. He did not look well, and till he had swal- 



 

lowed two cups of coffee his hand shook. The cap- 
tain watched him furtively from under his bushy 
eyebrows, and was evidently troubled and preoccu- 
pied, addressing a word now and then to Mr. Wat- 
terson, who, by virtue of what was apparently the 
ship's discipline, spoke only when he was spoken 
to, and then answered with prompt acquiescence. 
Dunham and Stamford exchanged not so much a 
glance as a consciousness in regard to him, which 
seemed to recognize and class him. They talked 
to each other, and sometimes to the captain. Once 
they spoke to Lydia. Mr. Dunham, for example, 
said, " Miss — ah — Blood, don't you think we are 
uncommonly fortunate in having such lovely weather 
for a start-off ? " 

" I don't know," said Lydia. 

Mr. Dunham arrested himself in the use of his 
fork. " I beg your pardon ? " he smiled. 

It seemed to be a question, and after a moment's 
doubt Lydia answered, "I didn't know it was 
strange to have fine weather at the start." 

" Oh, but I can assure you it is," said Dunham, 
with a certain lady-like sweetness of manner which 
he had. " According to precedent, we ought to be 
all deathly seasick." 

"Not at this time of year," said Captain Jen- 
ness, 

" Not at this time of year" repeated Mr. Wat- 
terson, as if the remark were an order to the crew. 

Dunham referred the matter with a look to his 



o 

friend, who refused to take part in it, and then he 
let it drop. But presently Staniford himself at- 
tempted the civility of some conversation with 
Lydia. He asked her gravely, and somewhat se- 
verely, if she had suffered much from the heat of 
the day before. 

" Yes," said Lydia, " it was very hot." 

" I 'm told it was the hottest day of the summer, 
so far," continued Staniford, with the same sever- 
ity. 

" I want to know ! " cried Lydia. 

The young man did not say anything more. 

As Dunham lit his cigar at Stamford's on deck, 
the former said significantly, " What a very Amer- 
ican thing ! " 

" What a bore ! " answered the other. 

Dunham had never been abroad, as one might 
imagine from his calling Lydia's presence a very 
American thing, but he had always consorted with 
people who had lived in Europe ; he read the Re- 
vue des Deux Mondes habitually, and the London 
weekly newspapers, and this gave him the foreign 
stand-point from which he was fond of viewing his 
native world. " It 's incredible," he added. " Who 
in the world can she be ? " 

" Oh, J don't know," returned Staniford, with a 
cold disgust. " I should object to the society of 
such a young person for a month or six weeks un- 
der the most favorable circumstances, and with fre- 
quent respites ; but to be imprisoned on the same 



 

ship with her, and to have her on one's mind and 
in one's way the whole time, is more than I bar- 
gained for. Captain Jenness should have told us ; 
though I suppose he thought that if she could stand 
it, we might. There 's that point of view. But it 
takes all ease and comfort out of the prospect. 
Here comes that blackguard." Staniford turned 
his back towards Mr. Hicks, who was approaching, 
but Dunham could not quite do this, though he 
waited for the other to speak first. 

" Will you — would you oblige me with a light ? " 
Mr. Hicks asked, taking a cigar from his case. 

" Certainly," said Dunham, with the comradery 
of the smoker. 

Mr. Hicks seemed to gather courage from his 
cigar. " You didn 't expect to find a lady passen- 
ger on board, did you ? " His poor disagreeable 
little face was lit up with unpleasant enjoyment of 
the anomaly. Dunham hesitated for an answer. 

" One never can know what one's fellow passen- 
gers are going to be," said Staniford, turning about, 
and looking not at Mr. Hicks's face, but his feet, 
with an effect of being, upon the whole, disap- 
pointed not to find them cloven. He added, to put 
the man down rather than from an exact belief in 
his own suggestion, " She 's probably some relation 
of the captain's." 

" Why, that 's the joke of it," said Hicks, flut- 
tered with his superior knowledge. " I 've been 
pumping the cabin-boy, and he says the captain 



 

never saw her till yesterday. She 's an up-country 
school-marm, and she came down here with her 
grandfather yesterday. She 's going out to meet 
friends of hers in Venice." The little man pulle-d 
at his cigar, and coughed and chuckled, and waited 
confidently for the impression. 

" Dunham," said Stamford, " did I hand you that 
sketch-block of mine to put in your bag, when we 
were packing last night ? " 

" Yes, I 've got it." 

" I 'm glad of that. Did you see Murray y ester- 
day?" 

"No; he was at Cambridge." 

" I thought he was to have met you at Parker's." 
The conversation no longer included Mr. Hicks or 
the subject he had introduced ; after a moment's 
hesitation, he walked away to another part of the 
ship. As soon as he was beyond ear-shot, Stamford 
again spoke : " Dunham, this girl is plainly one of 
those cases of supernatural innocence, on the part 
of herself and her friends, which, as you suggested, 
wouldn 't occur among any other people in the 
world but ours." 

" You 're a good fellow, Stamford ! " cried Dun- 
ham. 

" Not at all. I call myself simply a human 
being, with the elemental instincts of a gentleman, 
as far as concerns this matter. The girl has been 
placed in a position which could be made very pain- 
ful to her. It seems to me it's our part to prevent 




it from being so. I doubt if she finds it at all 
anomalous, and if we choose she need never do so 
till after we 've parted with her. I fancy we can 
preserve her unconsciousness intact." 

" Staniford, this is like you," said his friend, with 
glistening eyes. "I had some wild notion of the 
kind myself, but I 'm so glad you spoke of it first." 

" Well, never mind," responded Staniford. " We 
must make her feel that there is nothing irregular 
or uncommon in her being here as she is. I don't 
know how the matter 's to be managed, exactly ; it 
must be a negative benevolence for the most part ; 
but it can be done. The first thing is to cow that 
nuisance yonder. Pumping the cabin-boy ! The 
little sot ! Look here, Dunham ; it 's such a satis- 
faction to me to think of putting that fellow under 
foot that I 'll leave you all the credit of saving the 
young lady's feelings. I should like to begin stamp- 
ing on him at once." 

" I think you have made a beginning already, I 
confess I wish you hadn 't such heavy nails in your 
boots!" 

" Oh, they 'll do him good, confound him ! " said 
Staniford. 

" I should have liked it better if her name hadn 't 
been Blood," remarked Dunham, presently. 

" It doesn't matter what a girl's surname is. Be- 
sides, Blood is very frequent in some parts of the 
State." 

"She's very pretty, isn't she?" Dunham sug- 
gested. 



 

" Oh, pretty enough, yes," replied Stamford. 
"Nothing is so common as the pretty girl of our 
nation. Her beauty is part of the general tiresome- 
ness of the whole situation." 

" Don't you think," ventured his friend, further, 
a that she has rather a lady-like air ? " 

"She wanted to know," said Staniford, with a 
laugh. 

Dunham was silent a while before he asked, 
" What do you suppose her first name is ? " 

" Jerusha, probably." 

" Oh, impossible ! " 

" Well, then, — Lurella. You have no idea of 
the grotesqueness of these people's minds. I used 
to see a great deal of their intimate life when I went 
on my tramps, and chanced it among them, for bed 
and board, wherever I happened to be. We culti- 
vated Yankees and the raw material seem hardly of 
the same race. Where the Puritanism has gone out 
of the people in spots, there 's the rankest growth 
of all sorts of crazy heresies, and the old scriptural 
nomenclature has given place to something com- 
pounded of the fancifulness of story-paper romance 
and the gibberish of spiritualism. They make up 
their names, sometimes, and call a child by what 
sounds pretty to them. I wonder how the captain 
picked up that scoundrel." 

The turn of Stamford's thought to Hicks was 
suggested by the appearance of Captain Jenness, 
who now issued from the cabin gangway, and came 



 

toward them with the shadow of unwonted trouble 
in his face. The captain, too, was smoking. 

" Well, gentlemen, ' he began, with the obvious 
indirectness of a man not used to diplomacy, " how 
do you like your accommodations ? " 

Staniford silently acquiesced in Dunham's reply 
that they found them excellent. "But you don't 
mean to say," Dunham added, "that you 're going 
to give us beefsteak and all the vegetables of the 
season the whole way over? " 

" No," said the captain ; "we shall put you on 
sea-fare soon enough. But you 'll like it. You 
don't want the same things at sea that you do on 
shore ; your appetite chops round into a different 
quarter altogether, and you want salt beef; but 
you 'll get it good. Your room 's pretty snug," he 
suggested. 

" Oh, it 's big enough," said Staniford, to whom 
he had turned as perhaps more in authority than 
Dunham. " While we 're well we only sleep in it, 
and if we 're seasick it doesn 't matter where we 
are." 

The captain knocked the ash from his cigar with 
the tip of his fat little finger, and looked down. 
" I was in hopes I could have let you had a room 
apiece, but I had another passenger jumped on me 
at the last minute. I suppose you see what 's the 
matter with Mr. Hicks ? " He looked up from one 
to another, and they replied with a glance of per- 
fect intelligence. "I don't generally talk my 



 

passengers over with one another, but I thought 
I 'd better speak to you about him. I found him 
yesterday evening at my agents', with his father. 
He's just been on a spree, a regular two weeks' 
tear, and the old gentleman didn 't know what to do 
with him, on shore, any longer. He thought he 'd 
send him to sea a vovaeje, and see what would come 
of it, and he plead hard with me to take him. I 
didn 't want to take him, but he worked away at 
me till I couldn 't say no. I argued in my own 
mind that he couldn 't get anything to drink on 
my ship, and that he 'd behave himself well enough 
as long as he was sober." The captain added rue- 
fully, " He looks worse this morning than he did 
last night. He looks bad. I told the old gentle- 
man that if he got into any trouble at Try-East, or 
any of the ports where we touched, he shouldn 't 
set foot on my ship again. But I guess he 'll keep 
pretty straight. He hasn 't got any money, for one 
thing." 

Stamford laughed. " He stops drinking for 
obvious reasons, if for no others, like Artemus 
Ward's destitute inebriate. Did you think only 
of us in deciding whether you should take him ? " 

The captain looked up quickly at the young men, 
as if touched in a sore place. " Well, there again 
I didn 't seem to get my bearings just right. I 
suppose you mean the young lady ? " Stamford 
motionlessly and silently assented. "Well, she's 
more of a young lady than I thought she was, when 



 

her grandfather first come down here and talked of 
sending her over with me. He was always speak- 
ing about his little girl, you know, and I got the 
idea that she was about thirteen, or eleven, may be. 
I thought the child might be some bother on the 
voyage, but thinks I, I 'm used to children, and I 
guess I can manage. Bless your soul ! when I first 
see her on the wharf yesterday, it most knocked me 
down ! I never believed she was half so tall, nor 
half so good-looking." Staniford smiled at this 
expression of the captain's despair, but the captain 
did not smile. " Why, she was as pretty as a bird! 
Well, there I was. It was no time then to back 
out. The old man wouldn 't understood. Besides, 
there was the young lady herself, and she seemed 
so forlorn and helpless that I kind of pitied her. I 
thought, What if it was one of my own girls ? And 
I made up my mind that she shouldn 't know from 
anything I said or did that she wasn 't just as much 
at home and just as much in place on my ship as 
she would be in my house. I suppose what made 
me feel easier about it, and took the queerness off 
some, was my having my own girls along last voy- 
age. To be sure, it ain't quite the same thing," 
said the captain, interrogatively.
