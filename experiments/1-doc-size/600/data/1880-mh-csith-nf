Clean, wash, and cut to pieces a couple of Spring chickens. Have
ready in a frying-pan enough boiling lard or dripping to cover them
well. Dip each piece in beaten egg when you have salted it, then in
cracker-crumbs, and fry until brown. If the chicken is large, steam
it before frying, as directed in the foregoing receipt. When you have
taken out the meat, throw into the hot fat a dozen sprigs of parsley,
and let them remain a minute—just long enough to crisp, but not to dry
them. Garnish the chicken by strewing these over it.


FRIED CHICKEN (No. 2).

Cut up half a pound of fat salt pork in a frying-pan, and fry until the
grease is extracted, but not until it browns. Wash and cut up a young
chicken (broiling size), soak in salt and water for half an hour; wipe
dry, season with pepper, and dredge with flour; then fry in the hot
fat until each piece is a rich brown on both sides. Take up, drain,
and set aside in a hot covered dish. Pour into the gravy left in the
frying-pan a cup of milk—half cream is better; thicken with a spoonful
of flour and a tablespoonful of butter; add some chopped parsley, boil
up, and pour over the hot chicken. This is a standard dish in the Old
Dominion, and tastes nowhere else as it does when eaten on Virginia
soil. The cream gravy is often omitted, and the chicken served up dry,
with bunches of fried parsley dropped upon it.


CHICKEN POT-PIE.

Line the bottom and sides of a pot with a good rich paste, reserving
enough for a top crust and for the square bits to be scattered through
the pie. Butter the pot very lavishly, or your pastry will stick to it
and burn. Cut up a fine large fowl, and half a pound of corned ham or
salt pork. Put in a layer of the latter, pepper it, and cover with
pieces of the chicken, and this with the paste dumplings or squares.
If you use potatoes, parboil them before putting them into the pie,
as the first water in which they are boiled is rank and unwholesome.
The potatoes should be sliced and laid next the pastry squares; then
another layer of pork, and so on until your chicken is used up. Cover
with pastry rolled out quite thick, and slit this in the middle. Heat
very slowly, and boil two hours. Turn into a large dish, the lower
crust on top, and the gravy about it.

This is the old-fashioned pot-pie, dear to the memory of men who were
school-boys thirty and forty years ago. If you are not experienced in
such manufactures, you had better omit the lower crust; and, having
browned the upper, by putting a hot pot-lid or stove-cover on top of
the pot for some minutes, remove dexterously without breaking. Pour out
the chicken into a dish, and set the crust above it.

Veal, beef-steak, lamb (not mutton), hares, &c., may be substituted for
the chicken. The pork will salt it sufficiently.


BAKED CHICKEN PIE 

Is made as above, but baked in a buttered pudding-dish, and, in place
of the potatoes, three hard-boiled eggs are chopped up and strewed
among the pieces of chicken. If the chickens are tough, or even
doubtful, parboil them before making the pie, adding the water in
which they were boiled, instead of cold water, for gravy. If they are
lean, put in a few bits of butter. Ornament with leaves cut out with a
cake-cutter, and a star in the centre. Bake an hour—more, if the pie is
large.


CHICKEN PUDDING. 

Cut up as for fricassee, and parboil, seasoning well with pepper,
salt, and a lump of butter the size of an egg, to each chicken. The
fowls should be young and tender, and divided at every joint. Stew
slowly for half an hour, take them out, and lay on a flat dish to cool.
Set aside the water in which they were stewed for your gravy.

Make a batter of one quart of milk, three cups of flour, three
tablespoonfuls melted butter, half a teaspoonful soda, and one spoonful
of cream tartar, with four eggs well beaten, and a little salt. Put
a layer of chicken in the bottom of the dish, and pour about half a
cupful of batter over it—enough to conceal the meat; then, another
layer of chicken, and more batter, until the dish is full. The batter
must form the crust. Bake one hour, in a moderate oven, if the dish is
large.

Beat up an egg, and stir into the gravy which was set aside; thicken
with two teaspoonfuls of rice or wheat flour, add a little chopped
parsley; boil up, and send it to table in a gravy-boat.


CHICKEN AND HAM. 

Draw, wash, and stuff a pair of young fowls. Cut enough large, thick
slices of cold boiled ham to envelop these entirely, wrapping them up
carefully, and winding a string about all, to prevent the ham from
falling off. Put into your dripping-pan, with a little water to prevent
scorching; dashing it over the meat lest it should dry and shrink.
Invert a tin pan over all, and bake slowly for one hour and a quarter,
if the fowls are small and tender—longer, if tough. Lift the cover from
time to time to baste with the drippings—the more frequently as time
wears on. Test the tenderness of the fowls, by sticking a fork through
the ham into the breast. When done, undo the strings, lay the fowls in
a hot dish, and the slices of ham about them. Stir into the dripping a
little chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of browned flour wet in cold
water; pepper, and let it boil up once. Pour some of it over the
chickens—not enough to float the ham in the dish; serve the rest in a
gravy-boat.


ROAST DUCKS.

Clean, wash, and wipe the ducks very carefully. To the usual dressing
add a little sage (powdered or green), and a minced shallot. Stuff,
and sew up as usual, reserving the giblets for the gravy. If they
are tender, they will not require more than an hour to roast. Baste
well. Skim the gravy before putting in the giblets and thickening. The
giblets should be stewed in a very little water, then chopped fine, and
added to the gravy in the dripping-pan, with a chopped shallot and a
spoonful of browned flour.

Accompany with currant or grape jelly.


TO USE UP COLD DUCK. 

I may say, as preface, that cold duck is in itself an excellent supper
dish, or side dish, at a family dinner, and is often preferred to hot.
If the duck has been cut into at all, divide neatly into joints, and
slice the breast, laying slices of dressing about it. Garnish with
lettuce or parsley, and eat with jelly.

But if a warm dish is desired, cut the meat from the bones and lay in
a saucepan, with a little minced cold ham; pour on just enough water
to cover it, and stir in a tablespoonful of butter. Cover, and heat
gradually, until it is near boiling. Then add the gravy, diluted with
a little hot water; a great spoonful of catsup, one of Worcestershire
sauce, and one of currant or cranberry jelly, with a glass of wine and
a tablespoonful of browned flour.


Or,

You may put the gravy, with a little hot water and a lump of butter, in
a frying-pan, and when it is hot lay in the pieces of duck, and warm
up quickly, stirring in at the last a teaspoonful of Worcestershire
sauce and a tablespoonful of jelly.

Serve in a hot chafing-dish.

(For wild ducks, see GAME.)


STEWED DUCK.

This is a good way to treat an old tough fowl.

Clean and divide, as you would a chicken for fricassee. Put in a
saucepan, with several (minced) slices of cold ham or salt pork which
is not too fat, and stew slowly for at least an hour—keeping the lid
on all the while. Then stir in a chopped onion, a half-spoonful of
powdered sage, or of the green leaves cut fine, half as much parsley,
a tablespoonful catsup, and black pepper. Stew another half-hour, or
until the duck is tender, and add a teaspoonful brown sugar, and a
tablespoonful of browned flour, previously wet with cold water. Boil
up once, and serve in a deep covered dish, with green peas as an
accompaniment.


GUINEA FOWLS.

Many are not aware what an excellent article of food these speckled
Arabs of the poultry-yard are. They are kept chiefly for the beauty
of their plumage, and their delicious eggs, which are far richer than
those of chickens.

Unless young they are apt to be tough, and the dark color of the meat
is objected to by those who are not fond of, or used to eating game.
Cooked according to the foregoing receipt they are very savory, no
matter how old they may be. Put them on early, and stew slowly, and
good management will bring the desired end to pass. There is nothing
in the shape of game or poultry that is not amenable to this process,
providing the salt be omitted until the meat is tender.

But a pair of young Guinea fowls, stuffed and roasted, basting them
with butter until they are half done, deserve an honorable place upon
our bill of fare. Season the gravy with a chopped shallot, parsley,
or summer savory, not omitting the minced giblets, and thicken with
browned flour. Send around currant, or other tart jelly, with the fowl.
A little ham, minced fine, improves the dressing.


ROAST GOOSE.

Clean and wash the goose—not forgetting to put a spoonful of soda in
next to the last water, rinse out well, and wipe the inside quite
dry. Add to the usual stuffing of bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, etc., a
tablespoonful melted butter, an onion chopped fine, a tablespoonful
chopped sage, the yolks of two eggs, and some minute bits of fat pork.
Stuff body and craw, and sew up. It will take fully two hours to roast,
if the fire is strong. Cover the breast, until it is half done, with
white paper, or a paste of flour and water, removing this when you are
ready to brown.

Make a gravy as for roast duck, adding a glass of Sherry or Madeira, or
(if you can get it) old Port.

Send to table with cranberry or apple sauce.


GOOSE PIE.

An old goose is as nearly good for nothing as it is possible for
anything which was once valuable, and is not now absolutely spoiled,
to be. The best use to put it to is to make it into a pie, in the
following manner. Put on the ancient early in the morning, in cold
water enough to cover it, unsalted, having cut it to pieces at every
joint. Warm it up gradually, and let it stew—not boil hard—for four or
five hours. Should the water need replenishing, let it be done from
the boiling kettle. Parboil a beef’s tongue (corned), cut into slices
nearly half an inch thick; also slice six hard-boiled eggs. Line a deep
pudding-dish with a good paste; lay in the pieces of goose, the giblets
chopped, the sliced tongue and egg, in consecutive layers; season with
pepper, salt, and bits of butter, and proceed in this order until the
dish is full. If the goose be large, cut the meat from the bones after
stewing, and leave out the latter entirely. Intersperse with strips
of paste, and fill up with the gravy in which the goose was stewed,
thickened with flour. Cover with a thick paste, and when it is done,
brush over the top with beaten white of egg.

In cold weather this pie will keep a week, and is very good.


ROAST PIGEONS.

Clean, wash, and stuff as you would chickens. Lay them in rows,
if roasted in the oven, with a little water in the pan to prevent
scorching. Unless they are very fat, baste with butter until they are
half done, afterwards with their own gravy. Thicken the gravy that
drips from them, and boil up once; then pour into a gravy-boat. The
pigeons should lie close together in the dish.


STEWED PIGEONS.

Pick, draw, clean and stuff as above directed. Put the pigeons in a
deep pot with enough cold water to cover them, and stew gently for
an hour, or until, testing them with a fork, you find them tender.
Then season with pepper, salt, a few blades of mace, a little sweet
marjoram, and a good piece of butter. Stew, or rather simmer, for five
minutes longer—then stir in a tablespoonful of browned flour. Let it
boil up once; remove the pigeons, draw out the strings with which they
were sewed up, and serve, pouring the hot gravy over them. A little
salt pork or ham, cut into strips, is an improvement. This should be
put in when the pigeons have stewed half an hour.


BROILED PIGEONS OR SQUABS.

Young pigeons or “squabs” are rightly esteemed a great delicacy. They
are cleaned, washed, and dried carefully with a clean cloth; then split
down the back, and broiled like chickens. Season with pepper and salt,
and butter liberally in dishing them. They are in great request in a
convalescent’s room, being peculiarly savory and nourishing.

They may, for a change, be roasted whole, according to the receipt for
roast pigeons.


PIGEON PIE.

Is best made of wild pigeons. (SEE GAME.)



MEATS.


ROAST BEEF.

The best pieces for roasting are the sirloin and rib pieces. The latter
are oftenest used by small families. Make your butcher remove most of
the bone, and skewer the meat into the shape of a round. If you roast
in an oven, it is a good plan to dash a small cup of boiling water
over the meat in first putting it down, letting it trickle into the
pan. This, for a season, checks the escape of the juices, and allows
the meat to get warmed through before the top dries by said escape. If
there is much fat upon the upper surface, cover with a paste of flour
and water until it is nearly done. Baste frequently, at first with
salt and water, afterward with the drippings. Allow about a quarter of
an hour to a pound, if you like your meat rare; more, if you prefer
to have it well done. Some, when the meat is almost done, dredge with
flour and baste with butter—only once.

Remove the beef, when quite ready, to a heated dish; skim the
drippings; add a teacupful of boiling water, boil up once, and send
to table in a gravy-boat. Many reject made gravy altogether, and
only serve the red liquor that runs from the meat into the dish as
it is cut. This is the practice with some—indeed most of our best
housekeepers. If you have made gravy in a sauce-boat, give your guest
his choice between that and the juice in the dish.

Serve with mustard, or scraped horse-radish and vinegar.


ROAST BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Set a piece of beef to roast upon a grating, or several sticks laid
across a dripping-pan. Three-quarters of an hour before it is done,
mix the pudding and pour into the pan. Continue to roast the beef, the
dripping meanwhile falling upon the latter below. When both are done,
cut the pudding into squares, and lay around the meat when dished. If
there is much fat in the dripping-pan before the pudding is ready to be
put in, drain it off, leaving just enough to prevent the batter from
sticking to the bottom.

Receipt for Pudding.

    1 pint of milk.
    4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.
    2 cups of prepared flour.
    1 teaspoonful salt.

Be careful, in mixing, not to get the batter too stiff.

This pudding, which the cook who introduced it into my family persisted
in calling “Auction pudding,” is very palatable and popular, and not
so rich as would be thought from the manner of baking. It should be a
yellow-brown when done.


BEEF-STEAK.

It is not customary to fry beef-steaks for people who know what
really good cookery is. To speak more plainly, a steak, killed by
heat and swimming in grease, is a culinary solecism, both vulgar and
indigestible.

Cut the steak thick, at least three-quarters of an inch in thickness,
and if you cannot get tender meat for this purpose, it is best to
substitute some other dish for it. But since tender meat is not always
to be had, if the piece you have purchased is doubtful, lay it on a
clean cloth, take a blunt heavy carving-knife, if you have not a steak
mallet, and hack closely from one end to the other; then turn and
repeat the process upon the other side. The knife should be so dull
you cannot cut with it, and the strokes not the sixtieth part of an
inch apart. Wipe all over on both sides with lemon-juice, cover, and
leave it in a cool place for one hour. Lay on a buttered gridiron over
a clear fire, turning very often as it begins to drip. Do not season
until it is done, which will be in about twelve minutes, if the fire
is good and the cook attentive. Rub your hot chafing dish with a split
raw onion, lay in the steak, salt and pepper on both sides, and put a
liberal lump of butter upon the upper. Then put on a hot cover, and
let it stand five minutes to draw the juices to the surface before it
is eaten. If you have neither chafing-dish nor cover, lay the steak
between two hot platters for the same time, sending to table without
uncovering. A gridiron fitting under the grate is better than any
other. If a gridiron is not at hand, rub a little butter upon the
bottom of a hot, clean frying-pan, put in the meat, set over a bright
fire, and turn frequently. This will not be equal to steak cooked upon
a gridiron, but it is infinitely preferable to the same fried.

I shall never forget the wondering distrust with which my first cook,
a sable “professional,” watched me when I undertook to show her how
to prepare a steak for the third breakfast over which I presided as
mistress of ceremonies. And when, at the end of twelve minutes, I
removed the meat, “rare and hot,” to the heated dish in readiness, her
sniff of lofty contempt was as eloquent as indescribable.

“Call dat cooked! Folks ’bout here would ’a had dat steak on by
day-break!”

A remark that has been recalled to my mind hundreds of times since at
the tables of so-called capital housewives.

The best—nay, the only pieces for steak are those known as porter-house
and sirloin. The former is the more highly esteemed by gourmands; but
a really tender sirloin is more serviceable where there are several
persons in the family, the porter-house having a narrow strip of
extremely nice meat lying next the bone, while the rest is often
inferior to any part of the sirloin. If the meat be tender omit the
hacking process and lemon-juice.


BEEF-STEAK AND ONIONS.

Prepare the steak as above directed. While it is broiling put three
or four chopped onions in a frying-pan with a little beef-dripping or
butter. Stir and shake them briskly until they are done, and begin to
brown. Dish your steak and lay the onions thickly on top. Cover and
let all stand five or six minutes, that the hot onions may impart the
required flavor to the hot meat. In helping your guests, inquire if
they will take onions with the slices of steak put upon their plates. I
need hardly remind the sensible cook how necessary it is to withdraw
the gridiron from the fire for an instant, should the fat drip upon
the coals below, and smoke or blaze. Yet those who have eaten steaks
flavored with creosote may thank me for the suggestion.


BEEF À-LA-MODE. 

Take a round of beef; remove the bone from the middle, and trim away
the tougher bits about the edges, with such gristle, &c., as you can
reach. Set these aside for soup-stock.

Bind the beef into a symmetrical shape by passing a strip of stout
muslin, as wide as the round is high, about it, and stitching the
ends together at one side. Have ready at least a pound of fat salt
pork, cut into strips as thick as your middle finger, and long enough
to reach from top to bottom of the trussed round. Put a half pint of
vinegar over the fire in a tin or porcelain saucepan; season with
three or four minced shallots or button onions, two teaspoonfuls made
mustard, a teaspoonful nutmeg, one of cloves, half as much allspice,
half-spoonful black pepper, with a bunch of sweet herbs minced fine,
and a tablespoonful brown sugar. Let all simmer for five minutes, then
boil up once, and pour, while scalding hot, upon the strips of pork,
which should be laid in a deep dish. Let all stand together until
cold. Remove the pork to a plate, and mix with the liquor left in the
dish enough bread-crumbs to make a tolerably stiff force-meat. If the
vinegar is very strong, dilute with a little water before moistening
the crumbs. With a long, thin-bladed knife, make perpendicular
incisions in the meat, not more than half an inch apart, even nearer is
better; thrust into these the strips of fat pork, so far down that the
upper ends are just level with the surface, and work into the cavities
with them a little of the force-meat. Proceed thus until the meat is
fairly riddled and plugged with the pork. Fill the hole from which the
bone was taken with the dressing and bits of pork; rub the upper side
of the beef well with the spiced force-meat. Put into a baking-pan;
half-fill this with boiling water; turn a large pan over it to keep
in the steam, and roast slowly for five or six hours, allowing half
an hour to each pound of meat. If the beef be tough, you had better
stew the round by putting it in a pot with half enough cold water to
cover it. Cover tightly and stew very slowly for six hours; then set
in the oven with the gravy about it, and brown half an hour, basting
frequently.

If you roast the round, do not remove the cover, except to baste (and
this should be done often), until fifteen minutes before you draw it
from the oven. Set away with the muslin band still about it, and pour
the gravy over the meat.

When cold, lift from the gravy,—which, by the way, will be excellent
seasoning for your soup-stock,—cut the stitches in the muslin girdle,
remove carefully and send the meat to table, cold, garnished with
parsley and nasturtium blossoms. Carve horizontally, in slices thin
as a shaving. Do not offer the outside to any one; but the second cut
will be handsomely marbled with the white pork, which appearance should
continue all the way down.

I cannot too highly commend this as a side-dish at dinner, and a supper
and breakfast stand-by. In winter it will keep a week and more, and as
long in summer, if kept in the refrigerator—except when it is on the
table.


BREAKFAST STEW OF BEEF. 

Cut up two pounds of beef—not too lean—into pieces an inch long; put
them into a saucepan with just enough water to cover them, and stew
gently for two hours. Set away until next morning, when season with
pepper, salt, sweet marjoram or summer savory, chopped onion, and
parsley. Stew half an hour longer, and add a teaspoonful of sauce or
catsup, and a tablespoonful of browned flour wet up with cold water;
finally, if you wish to have it very good, half a glass of wine. Boil
up once, and pour into a covered deep dish.

This is an economical dish, for it can be made of the commoner parts
of the beef, and exceedingly nice for winter breakfasts. Eaten with
corn-bread and stewed potatoes, it will soon win its way to a place in
the “stock company” of every judicious housewife.


ANOTHER BREAKFAST DISH.

Cut thin slices of cold roast beef, and lay them in a tin saucepan
set in a pot of boiling water. Cover them with a gravy made of three
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one of walnut catsup, a teaspoonful
of vinegar, a little salt and pepper, a spoonful of currant jelly, a
teaspoonful made mustard, and some warm water. Cover tightly, and steam
for half an hour, keeping the water in the outer vessel on a hard boil.

If the meat is underdone, this is particularly nice.


BEEF HASH.

To two parts cold roast or boiled corned beef, chopped fine, put one of
mashed potatoes, a little pepper, salt, milk, and melted butter. Turn
all into a frying-pan, and stir until it is heated through and smoking
hot, but not until it browns. Put into a deep dish, and if stiff
enough, smooth as you would mashed potato, into a hillock.

Or, you can cease stirring for a few minutes, and let a brown crust
form on the under side; then turn out whole into a flat dish, the brown
side uppermost.

Or, mould the mixture into flat cakes; dip these in beaten egg flour,
and fry in hot drippings.

The remains of beef à-la-mode are very good prepared in any of these
ways. A little catsup and mustard are an improvement to plain cold
beef, thus hashed.


BEEF-STEAK PIE.

Cut the steak into pieces an inch long, and stew with the bone
(cracked) in just enough water to cover the meat until it is half-done.
At the same time parboil a dozen potatoes in another pot. If you wish
a bottom crust—a doubtful question—line a pudding-dish with a good
paste, made according to the receipt given below. Put in a layer of the
beef, with salt and pepper, and a very little chopped onion; then one
of sliced potatoes, with a little butter scattered upon them, and so
on, until the dish is full. Pour over all the gravy in which the meat
is stewed, having first thrown away the bone and thickened with browned
flour. Cover with a crust thicker than the lower, leaving a slit in the
middle.


CRUST FOR MEAT-PIES. 

    1 quart of flour.
    3 tablespoonfuls of lard.
    2½ cups milk.
    1 teaspoonful of soda wet with hot water, and stirred into the milk.
    2 teaspoonfuls of cream-tartar sifted into the dry flour.
    1 teaspoonful of salt.

Work up very lightly and quickly, and do not get too stiff.

If you can get prepared flour, omit the soda and cream-tartar.



BEEF PIE, WITH POTATO CRUST. 

Mince some rare roast beef or cold corned beef, if it is not too salt;
season with pepper and salt, and spread a layer in the bottom of a
pudding-dish. Over this put one of mashed potato, and stick bits of
butter thickly all over it; then another of meat, and so on until you
are ready for the crust.

To a large cupful of mashed potato add two tablespoonfuls of melted
butter, a well-beaten egg, two cups of milk, and beat all together
until very light. Then work in enough flour to enable you to roll
out in a sheet—not too stiff—and, when you have added to the meat
and potato in the dish a gravy made of warm water, butter, milk, and
catsup, with what cold gravy or dripping remains from “roast,” cover
the pie with a thick, tender crust, cutting a slit in the middle.

You can use the potato crust, which is very wholesome and good, for any
kind of meat-pie. It looks well brushed over with beaten white of egg
before it goes to table.


BEEF’S HEART—STEWED.

Wash the heart well, and cut into squares half an inch long. Stew them
for ten minutes in enough water to cover them. Salt the water slightly
to draw out the blood, and throw it away as it rises in scum to the
top. Take out the meat, strain the liquor, and return the chopped heart
to it, with a sliced onion, a great spoonful of catsup, some parsley, a
head of celery chopped fine, and cayenne pepper, with a large lump of
butter. Stew until the meat is very tender, when add a tablespoonful of
browned flour to thicken. Boil up once, and serve.


TO CORN BEEF.

Rub each piece of beef well with salt mixed with one-tenth part of
saltpetre, until the salt lies dry upon the surface. Put aside in a
cold place for twenty-four hours, and repeat the process, rubbing in
the mixture very thoroughly. Put away again until the next day, by
which time the pickle should be ready.

    5 gallons of water.
    1 gallon of salt.
    4 ounces saltpetre.
    1½ lb. brown sugar.

Boil this brine ten minutes; let it get perfectly cold; then pour over
the beef, having wiped the latter entirely dry.

Examine the pickle from time to time to see if it keeps well; if not,
take out the meat without delay, wipe it, and rub in dry salt, covering
it well until you can prepare new and stronger brine.


BOILED CORNED BEEF.

If your piece is a round, skewer it well into shape, and tie it up with
stout tape or twine when you have washed it in three or four waters and
removed all the salt from the outside. Put into a pot, and cover with
cold water. Allow, in boiling, about twenty minutes to a pound. Turn
the meat three times while cooking.

When done, drain very dry, and serve with drawn butter in a sauce-boat.
Send around mashed turnips with the meat. They should be boiled in a
separate pot, however, or they will impart a disagreeable taste to the
beef.

The brisket is a good piece for a family dinner.
