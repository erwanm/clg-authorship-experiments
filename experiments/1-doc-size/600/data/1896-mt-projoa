us small fry quite off our feet and almost drowned us with 
joy. The day of the great verdict, couriers had been de- 
spatched to the King with it, and the next morning bright 
and early the clear notes of a bugle came floating to us on 
the crisp air, and we pricked up our ears and began to count 
them. One — two — three ; pause ; one — two ; pause ; one — 
two — three, again — and out we skipped and went flying ; 
for that formula was used only when the King's herald-at 
arms would deliver a proclamation to the people. As we 
hurried along, people came racing out of every street and 
house and alley, men, women, and children, all flushed, 
excited, and throwing lacking articles of clothing on as 
they ran ; still those clear notes pealed out, and still the 
rush of people increased till the whole town was abroad 
and streaming along the principal street. At last we 
reached the square, which was now packed with citizens, 
and there, high on the pedestal of the great cross, we saw 
the herald in his brilliant costume, with his servitors about 
him. The next moment he began his delivery in the 
powerful voice proper to his office : 

' Know all men, and take heed therefore, that the most 
high, the most illustrious Charles, by the grace of God 
King of France, hath been pleased to confer upon his well- 
beloved servant Joan of Arc, called the Maid, the title, 
emoluments, authorities, and dignity of General-in-Chief 
of the Armies of France — ' 

Here a thousand caps flew into the air, and the multitude 

burst into a hurricane of cheers that raged and raged till it 
seemed as if it would never come to an end ; but at last it 
did ; then the herald went on and finished : 

— ' and hath appointed to be her lieutenant and chief of 
staff a prince of his royal house, his grace the Duke of 
Alenon ! ' 

That was the end, and the hurricane began again, and 
was split up into innumerable strips by the blowers of it 
and wafted through all the lanes and streets of the town. 

General of the Armies of France, with a prince of the 
blood for subordinate ! Yesterday she was nothing — to- 
day she was this. Yesterday she was not even a sergeant, 
not even a corporal, not even a private — to-day, with one 
step, she was at the top. Yesterday she was less than 
nobody to the newest recruit — to-day her command was 
law to La Hire, Saintrailles, the Bastard of Orleans, and 
all those others, veterans of old renown, illustrious masters 
of the trade of war. These were the thoughts I was think- 
ing ; I was trying to realise this strange and wonderful 
thing that had happened, you see. 

My mind went travelling back, and presently lighted 
upon a picture — a picture which was still so new and fresh 
in my memory that it seemed a matter of only yesterday — 
and indeed its date was no further back than the first days 
of January. This is what it was. A peasant girl in a far- 
off village, her seventeenth year not yet quite completed, 
and herself and her village as unknown as if they had been 
on the other side of the globe. She had picked up a 
friendless wanderer somewhere and brought it home — a 
small grey kitten in a forlorn and starving condition — and 
had fed it and comforted it and got its confidence and made 
it believe in her, and now it was curled up in her lap 
asleep, and she was knitting a coarse stocking and think- 
ing — dreaming — about what, one may never know. And 
now — the kitten had hardly had time to become a cat, and 
yet already the girl is General of the Armies of France, 
with a prince of the blood to give orders to, and out of her 
village obscurity her name has climbed up like the sun and 
is visible from all corners of the land ! It made me dizzy 
to think of these things, they were so out of the common 
order, and seemed so impossible. 



CHAPTER X 

Joan's first official act was to dictate a letter to the English 
commanders at Orleans, summoning them to deliver up all 
strongholds in their possession and depart out of France. 
She must have been thinking it all out before and arrang- 
ing it in her mind, it flowed from her lips so smoothly, and 
framed itself into such vivacious and forcible language. 
Still, it might not have been so ; she always had a quick 
mind and a capable tongue, and her faculties were con- 
stantly developing in these latter weeks. This letter was 
to be forwarded presently from Blois. Men, provisions, 
and money were offering in plenty now, and Joan ap- 
pointed Blois as a recruiting station and depot of supplies, 
and ordered up La Hire from the front to take charge. 

The Great Bastard — him of the ducal house, and 
governor of Orleans — had been clamouring for weeks for 
Joan to be sent to him, and now came another messenger, 
old D'Aulon, a veteran officer, a trusty man and fine and 
honest. The King kept him, and gave him to Joan to be 
chief of her household, and commanded her to appoint the 
rest of her people herself, making their number and dignity 
accord with the greatness of her office ; and at the same 
time he gave order that they should be properly equipped 
with arms, clothing, and horses. 

Meantime the King was having a complete suit of 
armour made for her at Tours. It was of the finest steel, 
heavily plated with silver, richly ornamented with engraved 
designs, and polished like a mirror. 

Joan's Voices had told her that there was an ancient 
sword hidden somewhere behind the altar of St. Catherine's 

at Fierbois, and she sent De Metz to get it. The priests 
knew of no such sword, but a search was made, and sure 
enough it was found in that place, buried a little way under 
the ground. It had no sheath and was very rusty, but the 
priests polished it up and sent it to Tours, whither we were 
now to come. They also had a sheath of crimson velvet 
made for it, and the people of Tours equipped it with 
another one, made of cloth of gold. But Joan meant to 
carry this sword always in battle ; so she laid the showy 
sheaths away and got one made of leather. It was 
generally believed that this sword had belonged to Charle- 
magne, but that was only a matter of opinion. I wanted 
to sharpen that old blade, but she said it was not necessary, 
as she should never kill anybody, and should carry it only 
as a symbol of authority. 

At Tours she designed her Standard, and a Scotch 
painter named James Power made it. It was of the most 
delicate white boucassin with fringes of silk. For device 
it bore the image of God the Father throned in the clouds 
and holding the world in His hand ; two angels knelt at 
His feet, presenting lilies ; inscription, Jesus, Maria ; on 
the reverse the crown of France supported by two angels. 

She also caused a smaller standard or pennon to be 
made, whereon was represented an angel offering a lily to 
the Holy Virgin. 

Everything was humming, there at Tours. Every now 
and then one heard the bray and crash of military music, 
every little while one heard the measured tramp of march- 
ing men — squads of recruits leaving for Blois ; songs and 
shoutings and huzzas filled the air night and day, the town 
was full of strangers, the streets and inns were thronged, 
the bustle of preparation was everywhere, and everybody 
carried a glad and cheerful face. Around Joan's head- 
quarters a crowd of people was always massed, hoping 
for a glimpse of the new General, and when they got it, 
they went wild , but they seldom got it, for she was busy 
planning her campaign, receiving reports, giving orders, 
despatching couriers, and giving what odd moments she 
could spare to the companies of great folk waiting in the 
drawing-rooms. As for us boys, we hardly saw her at all, 
she was so occupied. 

We were in a mixed state of mind — sometimes hopeful, 
sometimes not ; mostly not. She had not appointed her 
household yet — that was our trouble. We knew she was 
being overrun with applications for places in it, and that 
these applications were backed by great names and weighty 
Influence, whereas we had nothing of the sort to recom- 
mend us. She could fill her humblest places with titled 
folk — folk whose relationships would be a bulwark for her 
and a valuable support at all times. In these circumstances 
would policy allow her to consider us ? We were not as 
cheerful as the rest of the town, but were Inclined to be 
depressed and worried. Sometimes we discussed our slim 
chances, and gave them as good an appearance as we could. 
But the very mention of the subject was anguish to the 
Paladin ; for whereas we had some little hope, he had none 
at all. As a rule, Noel Ralnguesson was quite willing to 
let the dismal matter alone ; but not when the Paladin was 
present. Once we were talking the thing over, when Noel 
said : 

' Cheer up. Paladin ; I had a dream last night, and you 
were the only one among us that got an appointment. It 
wasn't a high one, but it was an appointment, anyway — 
some kind of a lackey or body-servant, or something of 
that kind.' 

The Paladin roused up and looked almost cheerful ; for 
he was a believer In dreams, and In anything and every- 
thing of a superstitious sort, in fact. He said, with a rising 
hopefulness : 

' I wish it might come true. Do you think It will come 
true ? ' 

' Certainly ; I might almost say I know it will, for my 
dreams hardly ever fail.' 

' Noel, I could hug you if that dream could come true, 
I could indeed ! To be servant to the first General of 
France and have all the world hear of it, and the news go 
back to the village and make those gawks stare that always 
said I wouldn't ever amount to anything — wouldn't it be 
great ! Do you think it will come true, Noel ? Don't you 
believe it will ? ' 

' I do. There's my hand on it.' 

' Noel, if it comes true I'll never forget you — shake 
again ! I should be dressed in a noble livery, and the news 
would go to the village, and those animals would say, 
' Jlim, lackey to the General-in-Chief, with the eyes of the 
whole world on him, admiring — well, he has shot up into 
the sky, now, hasn't he ? ' " 

He began to walk the floor and pile castles In the air so 
fast and so high that we could hardly keep up with him. 
Then all of a sudden all the joy went out of his face and 
misery took its place, and he said ; 

' Oh dear, it is all a mistake, it will never come true. I 
forgot about that foolish business at Toul. I have kept 
out of her sight as much as I could, all these weeks, hoping 
she would forget that and forgive it — but I know she never 
will. She can't, of course. And, after all, I wasn't to 
blame. I did say she promised to marry me, but they put 
me up to it and persuaded me, I swear they did ! ' The 
vast creature was almost crying. Then he pulled himself 
together and said, remorsefully, ' It was the only lie I've 
ever told, and — ' 

He was drowned out with a chorus of groans and out- 
raged exclamations ; and before he could begin again, 
one of D'Aulon's liveried servants appeared and said we 
were required at headquarters. We rose, and Noel said : 

' There — what did I tell you ? I have a presentiment — 
the spirit of prophecy is upon me. She is going to appoint 
him, and we are to go there and do him homage. Come 
along ! ' 

But the Paladin was afraid to go, so we left him. 

When we presently stood in the presence, in front of a 
crowd of glittering officers of the army, Joan greeted us 
with a winning smile, and said she appointed all of us to 
places in her household, for she wanted her old friends by 
her. It was a beautiful surprise to have ourselves honoured 
like this when she could have had people of birth and con- 
sequence instead, but we couldn't find our tongues to say 
so, she was become so great and so high above us now. 
One at a time we stepped forward and each received his 
warrant from the hand of our chief, D'Aulon. All of us 
had honourable places : the two knights stood highest ; 
then Joan's two brothers ; I was first page and secretary, 
a young gentleman named Raimond was second page ; 
Noel was her messenger ; she had two heralds, and also a 
chaplain and almoner, whose name was Jean Pasquerel. 
She had previously appointed a maitre d'hotel and a number 
of domestics. Now she looked around and said : 

' But where is the Paladin ? ' 
The Sieur Bertrand said : 

' He thought he was not sent for, your Excellency.' 

' Now that is not well. Let him be called.' 

The Paladin entered humbly enough. He ventured 
no farther than just within the door. He stopped there, 
looking embarrassed and afraid. Then Joan spoke plea- 
santly, and said : 

' I watched you on the road. You began badly, but 
improved. Of old you were a fantastic talker, but there is 
a man in you, and I will bring it out.' It was fine to see 
the Paladin's face light up when she said that. ' Will you 
follow where I lead ? ' 

' Into the fire ! ' he said ; and I said to myself, ' By the 
ring of that, I think she has turned this braggart into a 
hero. It is another of her miracles, I make no doubt of 
it.' 

' I believe you,' said Joan. ' Here — take my banner. 
Ycu will ride with me in every field, and when France is 
saved you will give it me back.' 

He took the banner, which is now the most precious of 
the memorials that remain of Joan of Arc, and his voice 
was unsteady with emotion when he said : 

' If I ever disgrace this trust, my comrades here will 
know how to do a friend's office upon my body, and this 
charge I lay upon them, as knowing they will not fail me.' 



CHAPTER XI 

Noel and I went back together — silent at first, and im- 
pressed. Finally Noel came up out of his thinkings and 
said : 

' The first shall be last and the last first — there's authority 
for this surprise. But at the same time wasn't it a lofty 
hoist for our big bull ! ' 

' It truly was ; I am not over being stunned yet. It 
was the greatest place in her gift.' 

' Yes, it was. There are many generals, and she can 
create more ; but there is only one Standard-Bearer.' 

' True. It is the most conspicuous place in the army, 
after her own.' 

' And the most coveted and honourable. Sons of two 
dukes tried to get it, as we know. And of all people in 
the world, this majestic windmill carries it off. Well, 
isn't it a gigantic promotion, when you come to look 
at it ! ' 

' There's no doubt about it. It's a kind of copy of 
Joan's own in miniature.' 

' I don't know how to account for it — do you ? ' 
' Yes, without any trouble at all — that is, I think I do.' 
Noel was surprised at that, and glanced up quickly, as 
if to see if I was in earnest. He said : 

' I thought you couldn't be in earnest, but I see you 
are. If you can make me understand this puzzle, do it. 
Tell me what the explanation is.' 

' I believe I can. You have noticed that our chief 


knight says a good many wise things and has a thoughtful 
head on his shoulders. One day, riding along, we were 
talking about Joan's great talents, and he said, ''But, 
greatest of all her gifts, she has the seeing eye." I said, 
like an unthinking fool, ''The seeing eye? — I shouldn't 
count that for much ; I suppose we all have it." ''No," 
he said; "very few have it." Then he explained, and 
made his meaning clear. He said the common eye sees 
only the outside of things, and judges by that ; but the 
seeing eye pierces through and reads the heart and the 
soul, finding there capacities which the outside didn't indi- 
cate or promise, and which the other kind of eye couldn't 
detect. He said the mightiest military genius must fail 
and come to nothing if it have not the seeing eye — that is 
to say, if it cannot read men and select its subordinates 
with an infallible judgment. It sees as by intuition that 
this man is good for strategy, that one for dash and dare- 
devil assault, the other for patient bull-dog persistence, 
and it appoints each to his right place and wins ; while 
the commander without the seeing eye would give to each 
the other's place and lose. He was right about Joan, and 
I saw it. When she was a child and the tramp came one 
night, her father and all of us took him for a rascal, but 
she saw the honest man through the rags. When I dined 
with the governor of Vaucouleurs so long ago, I saw 
nothing in our two knights, though I sat with them 
and talked with them two hours ; Joan was there fivej 
minutes, and neither spoke with them nor heard therrij 
speak, yet she marked them for men of worth and fidelity, 
and they have confirmed her judgment. Whom has she! 
sent for to take charge of this thundering rabble of new 
recruits at Blois, made up of old disbanded Armagnac 
raiders, unspeakable hellions, every one? Why, she has 
sent for Satan himself — that is to say, La Hire — that 
military hurricane, that godless swashbuckler, that lurid con-j 
flagration of blasphemy, that Vesuvius of profanity, for
ever in eruption. Does he know how to deal with thai 


mob of roaring" devils ? Better than any man that lives ; 
for he is the head devil of this world his own self, he is the 
match of the whole of them combined, and probably the 
father of most of them. She places him in temporary 
command until she can get to Blois herself — and then ! 
Why, then she will certainly take them in hand personally, 
or I don't know her as well as I ought to, after all these 
years of intimacy. That will be a sight to see — that fair 
spirit in her white armour, delivering her will to that 
muck-heap, that rag-pile, that abandoned refuse of per- 
dition.' 

' La Hire ! ' cried Noel, ' our hero of all these years — I 
do want to see that man ! ' 

' I too. His name stirs me just as it did when I was a 
little boy.' 

' I want to hear him swear.' 

' Of course. I would rather hear him swear than 
another man pray. He is the frankest man there is, and 
the naivest. Once when he was rebuked for pillaging on 
his raids, he said it was nothing. I judge he is the right 
man to take temporary charge there at Blois. Joan has 
cast the seeing eye upon him, you see.' 

' Which brings us back to where we started. I have 
an honest affection for the Paladin, and not merely because 
he is a good fellow, but because he is my child — I made 
him what he is, the windiest blusterer and most catholic 
liar in the kingdom. I'm glad of his luck, but I hadn't the 
seeing" eye. I shouldn't have chosen him for the most 
dangerous post in the army ; I should have placed him in 
the rear to kill the wounded and violate the dead.' 

' Well, we shall see. Joan probably knows what is in 
him better than we do. And I'll give you another idea. 
When a person in Joan of Arc's position tells a man he is 
brave, he believes it, and believing it is enough ; in fact, to 
believe yourself brave is to be brave ; it is the one only 
essential thing.' 


' Now you've hit it ! ' cried Noel. ' She's got the 
creating mouth as well as the seeing eye ! Ah yes, that 
is the thing. France was cowed and a coward ; Joan of 
Arc has spoken, and France is marching, with her head 
up!' 

I was summoned now, to write a letter from Joan's 
dictation. During the next day and night our several 
uniforms were made by the tailors, and our new armour 
provided. We were beautiful to look upon now, whether 
clothed for peace or war. Clothed for peace, in costly 
stuffs and rich colours, the Paladin was a tower dyed with 
the glories of the sunset ; plumed and sashed and iron-clad 
for war, he was a still statelier thing to look at. 

Orders had been issued for the march towards Blois. 
It was a clear, sharp, beautiful morning. As our showy 
great company trotted out in column, riding two and two, 
Joan and the Duke of Alenon in the lead, D'Aulon and the 
big standard-bearer next, and so on, we made a handsome 
spectacle as you may well imagine ; and as we ploughed 
through the cheering crowds, with Joan bowing her plumed 
head to left and right and the sun glinting from her silver 
mail, the spectators realised that the curtain was rolling up 
before their eyes upon the first act of a prodigious drama, 
and their rising hopes were expressed in an enthusiasm 
that increased with each moment, until at last one seemed 
to even physically feel the concussion of the huzzas as well 
as hear them. Far down the street we heard the softened 
strains of wind-blown music, and saw a cloud of lancers 
moving, the sun glowing with a subdued light upon the 
massed armour but striking bright upon the soaring lance- 
heads — a vaguely luminous nebula, so to speak, with a 
constellation twinkling above it — and that was our guard 
of honour. It joined us, the procession was complete, the 
first war-march of Joan of Arc was begun, the curtain was 
up. 



CHAPTER XII 

We were at Blois three days. Oh, that camp, it is one of 
the treasures of my memory ! Order ? There was no more 
order among those brigands than there is among the wolves 
and the hyenas. They went roaring and drinking about, 
whooping, shouting, swearing, and entertaining themselves 
with all manner of rude and riotous horse-play ; and the 
place was full of loud and lewd women, and they were no 
whit behind the men for romps and noise and fantastics. 

It was in the midst of this wild mob that Noel and I 
had our first glimpse of La Hire. He answered to our 
dearest dreams. He was of great size and of martial bear- 
ing, he was cased in mail from head to heel, with a bushel 
of swishing plumes on his helmet, and at his side the vast 
sword of the time. 

He was on his way to pay his respects in state to Joan, 
and as he passed through the camp he was restoring order, 
and proclaiming that the Maid was come, and he would 
have no such spectacle as this exposed to the head of 
the army. His way of creating order was his own, not 
borrowed. He did it with his great fists. As he moved 
along swearing and admonishing, he let drive this way, 
that way, and the other, and wherever his blow landed, a 
man went down. 

' Damn you ! ' he said, ' staggering and cursing around 
like this, and the Commander-in-Chief in the camp ! 
Straighten up ! ' and he laid the man flat. What his idea 
of straightening up was, was his own secret. 

We followed the veteran to headquarters, listening, 
observing, admiring — yes, devouring, you may say, the pet 
hero of the boys of France from our cradles up to that 
happy day, and their idol and ours. I called to mind how 
Joan had once rebuked the Paladin, there in the pastures of 
Domremy, for uttering lightly those mighty names, La Hire 
and the Bastard of Orleans, and how she said that if she 


could but be permitted to stand afar off and let her eyes 
rest once upon those great men, she would hold it a 
privilege. They were to her and the other girls just what 
they were to the boys. Well, here was one of them at last 
— and what was his errand ? It was hard to realise it, and 
yet it was true ; he was coming to uncover his head before 
her and take her orders. 

While he was quieting a considerable group of his 
brigands in his soothing way, near headquarters, we stepped 
on ahead and got a glimpse of Joan's military family, the 
great chiefs of the army, |for they had all arrived now. 
There they were, six officers of wide renown, handsome 
men in beautiful armour, but the Lord High Admiral of 
France was the handsomest of them all and had the most 
gallant bearing. 

When La Hire entered, one could see the surprise in his 
face at Joan's beauty and extreme youth, and one could 
see, too, by Joan's glad smile, that it made her happy to 
get sight of this hero of her childhood at last. La Hire 
bowed low, with his helmet in his gauntleted hand, and 
made a bluff but handsome little speech with hardly an oath 
in it, and one could see that those two took to each other 
on the spot. 

The visit of ceremony was soon over, and the others 
went away ; but La Hire stayed, and he and Joan sat there, 
and he sipped her wine, and they talked and laughed 
together like old friends. And presently she gave him 
some instructions, in his quality as master of the camp, 
which made his breath stand still. For, to begin with, she 
said that all those loose women must pack out of the place 
at once, she wouldn't allow one of them to remain. Next, 
the rough carousing must stop, drinking must be brought 
within proper and strictly defined limits, and discipline must 
take the place of disorder. And finally she climaxed the 
list of surprises with this — which nearly lifted him out of 
his armour : 

' Every man who joins my standard must confess before 

the priest and absolve himself from sin ; and all accepted 
recruits must be present at divine service twice a day.' 

La Hire could not say a word for a good part of a 
minute, then he said, in deep dejection : 

' Oh, sweet child, they were littered in hell, these poor 
darlings of mine I Attend mass ? Why, dear heart, they'll 
see us both damned first ! ' 

And he went on, pouring out a most pathetic stream of 
arguments and blasphemy, which broke Joan all up, and 
made her laugh as she had not laughed since she played in 
the Domremy pastures. It was good to hear. 

But she stuck to her point ; so the soldier yielded, and 
said all right, if such were the orders he must obey, and 
would do the best that was in him ; then he refreshed him- 
self with a lurid explosion of oaths, and said that if any man 
in the camp refused to renounce sin and lead a pious life, 
he would knock his head off. That started Joan off again : 
she was really having a good time, you see. But she would 
not consent to that form of conversions. She said they 
must be voluntary. 

La Hire said that that was all right, he wasn't going to 
kill the voluntary ones, but only the others. 

No matter, none of them must be killed — Joan couldn't 
have it. She said that to give a man a chance to volunteer, 
on pain of death if he didn't, left him more or less tram- 
melled, and she wanted him to be entirely free. 

So the soldier sighed and said he would advertise the 
mass, but said he doubted if there was a man in camp 
that was any more likely to go to it than he was himself. 
Then there was another surprise for him, for Joan said : 

' But dear man, you are going ! ' 

' I ? Impossible ! Oh, this is lunacy ! ' 

' Oh no, it isn't. You are going to the service twice a 
day.' 

' Oh, am I dreaming ? Am I drunk — or is my hearing 
playing me false ? Why, I would rather go to — ' 

' Never mind where. In the morning you are going to 


begin, and after that it will come easy. Now don't look 
down-hearted like that. Soon you won't mind it.' 

La Hire tried to cheer up, but he was not able to do it. 
He sighed like a zephyr, and presently said : 

' Well, I'll do it for you, but before I would do it for
