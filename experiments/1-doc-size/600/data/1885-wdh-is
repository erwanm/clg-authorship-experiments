hero of her Carnival dream. The clinging regret 
with which she kept his hand at parting scarcely 
consoled him for what had happened. 

" I will come round in the morning," he said. " I 
must know how Effie is." 

"Yesj come." 



X. 



COLVILLE went to Palazzo Pinti next day with 
the feeling that he was defying Mrs. Bowen. Upon 
a review of the facts he could not find himself so 
very much to blame for the occurrences of the night 
before, and he had not been able to prove to his 
reason that Mrs. Bowen had resented his behaviour. 
She had not made a scene of any sort when he came 
in with Imogene ; it was natural that she should ex- 
cuse herself, and should wish to be with her sick 
child : she had done really nothing. But when a 
woman has done nothing she fills the soul of the 
man whose conscience troubles him with an instinct 
tive apprehension. There is then no safety, his 
nerves tell him, except in bringing the affair, what- 
ever it is, to an early issue — in having it out with 
her. Colville subdued the cowardly impulse of his 
own heart, which would have deceived him with the 
suggestion that Mrs. Bowen might be occupied with 
Effie, and it would be better to ask for Miss Graham. 
He asked for Mrs. Bowen, and she came in directly. 

She smiled in the usual way, and gave her hand, 
as she always did ; but her hand was cold, and she 



 

looked tired, though she said Effie was quite herself 
again, and had been asking for him. " Imogene has 
been telling her about your adventure last night, 
and making her laugh." 

If it had been Mrs. Bowen's purpose to mystify 
him, she could not have done it more thoroughly 
than by this bold treatment of the affair. He bent 
a puzzled gaze upon her. " I 'm glad any of you 
have found it amusing," he said ; " I confess that I 
couldn't let myself off so lightly in regard to it." 
She did not reply, and he continued : " The fact is, 
I don't think I behaved very well. I abused your 
kindness to Miss Graham." 

" Abused my kindness to Miss Graham ? ". 

" Yes. When you allowed her to dance at the 
veglione, I ought to have considered that you were 
stretching a point. I ought to have taken her back 
to you very soon, instead of tempting her to go and 
walk with me in the corridor." 

" Yes," said Mrs. Bowen. " So it was you who 
proposed it? Imogene was afraid that she had. 
What exemplary young people you are ! The way 
each of you confesses and assumes all the blame 
would leave the severest chaperone without a 
word." 

(Her gaiety made Colville uncomfortable. He 
said gravely, " What I blame myself most lor is 
that I was not there to be of use to you when 
Effie " 

"Oh, you mustn't think of that at all. Mr. 
Waters was most efficient. My admirer in the red 



 

mask was close at hand, and between them they got 
Effie out without the slightest disturbance. I fancy- 
most people thought it was a Carnival joke. Please 
don't think of that again.'' 

Nothing could be politer than all this. 

" And you won't allow me to punish myself for 
hot being there to give you even a moral support ? " 

" Certainly not. As I told Imogene, young 
people will be young people ; and I knew how fond 
you were of dancing.'' 

Though it pierced him, Colville could not help 
admiring the neatness of this thrust. " I didn't 
know you were so ironical, Mrs. Bowen." 

" Ironical ? Not at all." 

" Ah ! I see I 'm not forgiven." 

" I 'm sure I don't know what you mean." 

Imogene and Effie came in. The child was a 
little pale, and willingly let him take her on his 
knee, and lay her languid head on his shoulder. 
The girl had not aged overnight like himself and 
Mrs. Bowen; she looked as fresh and strong as 
yesterday. 

"Miss Graham," said Colville, "if a person to 
whom you had done a deadly wrong insisted that 
you hadn't done any wrong at all, should you con- 
sider yourself forgiven ? " 

" It would depend upon the person," said the girl, 
with innocent liveliness, recognising the extrava- 
gance in his tone. 

" Yes," he said, with an affected pensiveness, " so 
very much depends upon the person in such a case." 
L 



 

Mrs. Bowen rose. " Excuse me a moment ; I will 
be back directly. Don't get up, please," she said, 
and prevented him with a quick withdrawal to an- 
other room, which left upon his sense the impression 
of elegant grace, and a smile and sunny glance. 
But neither had any warmth in it. 

Colville heaved an involuntary sigh. "Do you 
feel very much used up ?" he asked Imogene. 

" Not at all," she laughed. " Do you ? " 

" Not in the least. My veglione hasn't ended yet. 
I'm still practically at the Pergola. It's easy to 
keep a thing of that sort up if you don't sleep after 
you get home.'' 

" Didn't you sleep ? I expected to lie awake a 
long time thinking it over ; but I dropped asleep at 
once. I suppose I was very tired. I didn't even 
dream." 

" You must have slept hard. You 're pretty apt 
to dream when you're waking.'' 

" How do you know ? " 

" Ah, I 've noticed when you 've been talking to 
me. Better not ! It 's a bad habit ; it gives you 
false views of things. I used " 

"But you mustn't say you useds That's for- 
bidden now. Eemember your promise ! " 

" My promise ? What promise ? " 

" Oh, if you 've forgotten already." 

" I remember. But that was last night." 

" No, no ! It was for all time. Why should 
dreams be so very misleading ? I think there 's ever 
so much in dreams. The most wonderful thing is 




the way you make people talk in dreams. It isn't 
strange that you should talk yourself, but that other 
people should say this and that when you aren't at 
all expecting what they say." 

" That 's when you 're sleeping. But when you 're 
waking, you make people say just what you want. 
And that's why day dreams are so bad. If you 
make people say what you want, they probably don't 
mean it." 

" Don't you think so ? " 

" Half the time. Do you ever have day dreams ? " 
he asked Effie, pressing her cheek against his 
own. 

" I don't know what they are," she murmured, 
with a soit little note of polite regret for her ignor- 
ance, if possibly it incommoded him. 

" You win by and by," he said, " and then you 
must look out for them. They 're particularly bad 
in this air. I had one of them in Florence once that 
lasted three months." 

" What was it about ? " asked the child. 

Imogene involuntarily bent forward. 

"Ah, I can't tell you now. She's trying to hear 
us." 

" No, no," protested the girl, with a laugh. " I 
was thinking of something else." 

" Oh, we know her, don't we ? " he said to the 
child, with a playful appeal to that passion for the 
joint possession of a mystery which all children 
have. 

" We might whisper it," she suggested. 



 

" No ; better wait for some other time." They 
were sitting near a table where a pencil and some 
loose leaves of paper lay. He pulled his chair a 
little closer, and, with the child still upon his knee, 
began to scribble and sketch at random. "Ah, 
there's San Miniato," he said, with a glance from 
the window. "Must get its outline in. You've 
heard how there came to be a church up there ? No ? 
Well, it shows the. sort of man San Miniato really 
was. He was one of the early Christians, and he 
gave the poor pagans a great deal of trouble. They 
first threw him to the wild beasts in the amphi- 
theatre, but the moment those animals set eyes on 
him they saw it would be of no use ; they just lay 
down and died. Very well, then ; the pagans de- 
termined to see what effect the axe would have upon 
San Miniato : but as soon as they struck off his head 
he picked it up, set it back on his shoulders again, 
waded across the Arno, walked up the hill, and when 
he came to a convenient little oratory up there he 
knelt down and expired. Isn't that a pretty good 
story ? It 's like fairies, isn't it ? " 

"Yes," whispered the child. 

"What nonsense!" said Imogene. "You made 
it up." 

"Oh, did I? Perhaps I built the church that 
stands there to commemorate the fact. It 's all in 
the history of Florence. Not in all histories ; some 
of them are too proud tb put such stories in, but I 'm 
going to put every one I can find into the history 
I'm writing for Effie. San Miniato was beheaded 



 

•where tte church of Santa Candida stands now, and 
he walked all that distance.'' 

" Did he have to die when he got to the oratory V 
asked the child, with gentle regret. 

" It appears so," said Colville, sketching. " He 
would have been dead by this time, anyway, you 
know." 

" Yes," she reluctantly admitted. 

"I never quite like those things, either, Effie," 
he said, pressing her to him. "There were people 
cruelly put to death two or three thousand years ago 
that I can't help feeling would be alive yet if they' 
had been justly treated. There are a good mayy 
fairy stories ateut Florence j perhaps they used to 
be true storiesG the truth seems to die out of stories 
after a while, simply because people stop believing 
them. Saint Ambrose of MUan restored the son of 
his host to life when he came down here to dedicate 
the Church of San Giovanni. Then there was 
another saint, San Zenobi, who worked a very 
pretty miracle after he was dead. They were carry- 
ing his body from the Church of San Giovanni to 
the Church of Santa Eeparata, and in Piazza San 
Giovanni his bier touched a dead elm-tree that stood 
there, and the tree instantly sprang into leaf and 
flower, though it was in the middle of the winter. 
A great many people took the leaves home with 
them, and a marble pillar was put uj) there, with a 
cross and an elm-tree carved on it. Oh, the case is 
very well authenticated." 

"I shall really begin to think you believe such 



 

things," said Imogene. " Perhaps you are a Catho- 
lic." 

Mrs. Bowen returned to the room, and sat down. 

"There's another fairy story, prettier yet," said 
Colville, while the little girl drew a long deep breath 
of satisfaction and expectation. "You've heard of 
the Buondelmonti ? " he asked Imogene. 

" Oh, it seems to me as if I 'd had nothing but the 
Buondelmonti dinned into me since I came to 
Florence !" she answered in lively despair. 

" Ah, this happened some centuries before the 
Buondelmonte you've been bored with was born. 
This was Giovanni Gualberto of the Buondelmonti, 
and he was riding along one day in 1003, near the 
Church of San Miniato, when he met a certain man 
named TJgo, who had killed one of his brothers. 
Gualberto stopped and drew his sword ; Ugo saw 
no other chance of escape, and he threw himself face 
downward on the ground, with his arms stretched 
out in the form of the cross. ' Gualberto, remember 
Jesus Christ, who died upon the cross praying for 
His enemies.' The story says that these words went 
to Gualberto's heart ; he got down from his horse, 
and in sign of pardon lifted his enemy and kissed 
and embraced him. Then they went together into 
the church, and fell on their knees before the figure 
of Christ upon the cross, and the figure bowed its 
head in sign of approval and pleasure in Gualberto's 
noble act of Christian piety." 

" Beautiful ! " murmured the girl ; the child only 
sighed. 



 

" All, yes ; it 's an easy matter to pick up one's 
head from the ground, and set it back on one's 
shoulders, or to bring the dead to life, or to make 
a tree put forth leaves and flowers in midwinter ; 
but to melt the heart of a man with forgiveness in 
the presence of his enemy — that 's a different thing ; 
that 's no fairy story ; that 's a real miracle ; and I 
believe this one happened — it 's so impossible." 

" Oh yes, it must have happened," said the girl. 

" Do you think it 's so very hard to forgive, then V 
asked Mrs. Bowen gravely. 

" Oh, not for ladies," replied Colville. 

She flushed, and her eyes shone when she glanced 
at him. 

" I 'm sorry to put you down," he said to the child ; 
" but I can't take you with me, and I must be go- 

Mrs. Bowen did not ask him to stay to lunch ; he 
thought afterward that she might have relented as far 
as that but for the last little thrust, which he would 
better have spared. 

"Efiie dear," said her mother, when the door 
closed upon Colville, "don't you think you'd 
better lie down a while ? You look so tired." 

" Shall I lie down on the sofa here ? " 

" No, on your bed." 

"Well." 

" I 'll go with you, Effie," said Imogene, " and see 
that you 're nicely tucked in." 

When she returned alone, Mrs. Bowen was sitting 
where she had left her, and seemed not to have 



 

moved. " I think Effie will drop off to sleep," she 
said ; "she seems drowsy." She sat down, and after 
a pensive moment continued, " I wonder what makes 
Mr. Colville seem so gloomy." 

" Does he seem gloomy ? " asked Mrs. Bowen un- 
sympathetically. 

"No, not gloomy exactly. But different from 
last night. I wish people could always be the 
same ! He was so gay and full of spirits ; and now 
he 's so self-absorbed. He thinks you 're offended 
with him, Mrs. Bowen," 

'• I don't think he was very much troubled about 
it. I only thought he was flighty from want of 
sleep. At your age you don't mind the loss of a 
night." 

" Do you think Mr. Colville seems so very old ? " 
asked Imogene anxiously. 

*> Mrs. Bowen appeared not to have heard her. She 
went to the window and looked out. When she 
came back, " Isn't it almost time for you to have a 
letter from home ? " she asked. 

" Why, no. I had one from mother day before 
yesterday. What made you think so ? " 

"Imogene," interrupted Mrs. Bowen, with a 
sudden excitement which she tried to control, but 
which made her lips tremble, and break a little from 
her restraint, " you know that, I am here in the 
place of your mother, to advise you and look after 
you in every way ? " 

" Why, yes, Mrs. Bowen," cried the girl, in sur- 
prise. 



 

"It's a position of great responsibility in regard 
to a young lady. I can't have anything to reproach 
myself with afterward.'' 

" No." 

" Have I always been kind to you, and considerate 
of your rights and your freedom ? Have I ever 
interfered with you in any way that you think I 
oughtn't ? " 

" What an idea ! You 've been loveliness itself, 
Mrs. Bowen ! " 

" Then I want you to listen to me, and answer me 
frankly, and not suspect my motives." 

" Why, how could I do that ? " 

" Never mind ! " cried Mrs. Bowen impatiently, 
almost angrily. " People can't help their suspicions ! 
Do you think Mr. Morton cares for you ? " 

The girl hung her head. 

•' Imogene, answer me ! " 

" I don't know," answered Imogene coldly; "but 
if you're troubled about that, Mrs. Bowen, you 
needn't be ; I don't care anything for Mr. Morton." 

" If I thought you were becoming interested in 
any one, it would be my duty to write to your 
mother and tell her." 

" Of course ; I should expect you to do it." 

"And if I saw you becoming interested in any 
one in a way that I thought would make you un- 
happy, it would be my duty to warn you.'' 

"Yes." 

" Of course, I don't mean that any one would 
knowingly try to make you unhappy ? " 



 

"No." 

"Men don't go about nowadays trying to break 
girls' hearts. But very good men can be thought- 
less and selfish." 

"Yes; I understand that," said Imogen e, in a 
falling accent. 

" I don't wish to prejudice you against any one. 
I should consider it very wrong and wicked. Be- 
sides, I don't care to interfere with you to that 
degree. You are old enough to see and judge for 
yourself." 

Imogene sat silent, passing her hand across the 
front of her dress. The clock ticked audibly from 
the mantel. 

"I will not have it left to me!" cried Mrs. 
Bowen. " It is hard enough, at any rate. Do you 
think I like to speak to you ? " 

"No." 

"Of course it makes me seem inhospitable, and 
distrustful, and detestable." 

" I never thought of accusing you," said the girl, 
slowly lifting her eyes. 

" I will never, never speak to you of it again," 
said Mrs. Bowen, "and from this time forth I insist 
upon your feeling just as free as if I hadn't spoken." 
She trembled upon the verge of a sob, from which 
she repelled herself. 

Imogene sat still, with a sort of serious, bewildered 
look. 

" You shall have every proper opportunity of 
meeting any one you like." 




"Oh yes." 

"And I shall be only too gl-glad to take back 
everything ! " 

Imogene sat motionless and silent. Mrs. Bowen 
broke out again with a sort of violence ; the years 
teach us something of self-control, perhaps, but they 
weaken and unstring the nerves. IT's this opposition 
of silence to silence, the woman of the world was no 
match for the inexperienced girl. 

" Have you nothing to say, Imogene ?" 

" I never thought of him iu that way at all. I 
don't know what to say yet. It — confuses me. I 
— I can't imagine it. But if you think that he is 
trying to amuse himself " 

" I never said that ! " 

"No, I know it." 

" He likes to make you talk, and to talk with you. 
But he is perfectly idle here, and — there is too much 
difference, every way. The very good in him makes 
it the worse. I suppose that after talking with him 
every one else seems insipid." 

"Yes." 

Mrs. Bowen rose and ran suddenly from the 
room. 

Imogene remained sitting cold and still. 

No one had been named since they spoke of Mr. 
Morton. 



XI. 



COLVILLE had not done what he meant in going to 
Mrs. Bowen's ; in fact, he had done just what he had 
not meant to do, as he distinctly perceived in coming 
away. It was then that in a luminous retrospect he 
discovered his motive to have been a wish to atone 
to her for behaviour that must have distressed her, 
or at least to explain it to her. She had not let him 
do this at once ; an instant willingness to hear and 
to condone was not in a woman's nature ; she had to 
make him feel, by the infliction of a degree of punish- 
ment, that she had suff'ered. But before she ended 
she had made it clear that she was ready to grant 
him a tacit pardon, and he had answered with a silly 
Narcasm the question that was to have led to peace. 
He co uld not help seeing that throughout the whole 
Carnival adventure she had yielded her cherished 
reluctan ces to please him, to show him that she was 
no t stiff or prudish, to conv ince him'ffi St she would
