"People have crossed it," I said. 

" Only fools," answered our surgeon, who despised 
foolhardiness. " Has a man nothing better to do with 
his life than risk it for the sake of a silly feat like 
that ? I would not so much as raise my eyes to see 
any one cross." 

" yes, you would, Monsieur Eodenai," cried a voice 
behind us. We both turned and caught a glimpse of 
i Jeannette as she bounded through the bushes and out 
to the very centre of the Arch, where she stood balan- 
cing herself and laughing gayly. Her form was outlined 
against the sky ; the breeze swayed her skirt ; she 
seemed hovering over the chasm. I watched her, mute 
with fear ; a word might cause her to lose her balance ; 
but I could not turn my eyes away, I was fascinated 
with the sight. I was not aware that Eodney had left 
me until he, too, appeared on the Arch, slowly finding 
a foothold for himself and advancing toward the centre. 
A fragment of the rock broke off under his foot and fell 
into the abyss below. 

" Go back, Monsieur Eodenai," cried Jeannette, see- 
ing his danger. 

" Will you come back too, Jeannette ? " 

"Moi? C'est auf chose" answered the girl, gayly 
tossing her pretty head. 

" Then I shall come out and carry you back, wilful 
child," said the surgeon. 

A peal of laughter broke from Jeannette as he spoke, 



 

and then she began to dance on her point of rock, 
swinging herself from side to side, marking the time 
with a song. I held my breath; her dance seemed 
unearthly ; it was as though she belonged to the Prince 
of the Powers of the Air. 

At length the surgeon reached the centre and caught 
the mocking creature in his arms : neither spoke, but 
I could see the flash of their eyes as they stood for 
an instant motionless. Then they struggled on the 
narrow foothold and swayed over so far that T buried 
my face in my trembling hands, unable to look at the 
dreadful end. When I opened my eyes again all was 
still; the Arch was tenantless, and no sound came 
from below. Were they, then, so soon dead ? With- 
out a cry ? I forced myself to the brink to look down 
over the precipice ; but while I stood there, fearing to 
look, I heard a sound behind me in the woods. It was 
Jeannette singing a gay French song. I called to her 
to stop. " How could you ? " I said severely, for I was 
still trembling with agitation. 

" Ce riest rien, madame. I cross l'Arche when I had 
five year. Mais, Monsieur Eodenai le Grand, he raise 
his eye to look this time, I think," said Jeannette, 
laughing triumphantly. 

" Where is he ? " 

"On the far side, gone on to Scott's Pic [Peak]. 
Ffroce, f&roce, comme un loupgarou ! Ah ! c'est joli, 
fa ! " And, overflowing with the wildest glee, the girl 



 

danced along through the woods in front of ine, now 
pausing to look at something in her hand, now laugh- 
ing, now shouting like a wild creature, until I lost 
sight of her. I went back to the fort alone. 

Tor several days I saw nothing of Kodney. When 
at last we met, I said, " That was a wild freak of Jean- 
nette's at the Arch." 

" Planned, to get a few shillings out of us." 
" Doctor ! I do not think she had any such mo- 
tive," I replied, looking up deprecatingly into his cold, 
scornful eyes. 

" Are you not a little sentimental over that ignorant, 
half- wild creature, Aunt Sarah ? " 

" Well," I said to myself, " perhaps I am ! " 
The summer came, sails whitened the blue straits 
again, steamers stopped for an hour or two at the 
island docks, and the summer travellers rushed ashore 
to buy " Indian curiosities," made by the nuns in Mon- 
treal, or to climb breathlessly up the steep fort-hill to 
see the pride and panoply of war. Proud was the 
little white fort in those summer days ; the sentinels 
held themselves stiffly erect, the officers gave up lying 
on the parapet half asleep, the best flag was hoisted 
daily, and there was much bugle-playing and ceremony 
connected with the evening gun, fired from the ram- 
parts at sunset; the hotels were full, the boarding- 
house keepers were in their annual state of wonder 
over the singular taste of these people from "below," 



 

who actually preferred a miserable white-fish to the 
best of beef brought up on ice all the way from Buf- 
falo ! There were picnics and walks, and much con- 
fusion of historical dates respecting Father Marquette 
and the irrepressible, omnipresent Pontiac. The fort 
officers did much escort duty; their buttons gilded 
every scene. Our quiet surgeon was foremost in ev- 
erything. 

" I am surprised ! I had no idea Dr. Prescott was 
so gay," said the Major's wife. 

" I should not think of calling him gay," I answered. 

" Why, my dear Mrs. Corlyne ! He is going all the 
time. Just ask Augusta." 

Augusta thereupon remarked that society, to a cer- 
tain extent, was beneficial; that she considered Dr. 
Prescott much improved; really, he was now very 
" nice." 

I silently protested against the word. But then I 
was not a Bostonian. 

One bright afternoon I went through the village, 
round the point into the French quarter, in search of a 
laundress. The fishermen's cottages faced the west; 
they were low and wide, not unlike scows drifted 
ashore and moored on the beach for houses. The lit- 
tle windows had gay curtains fluttering in the breeze, 
and the rooms within looked clean and cheery ; the 
rough walls were adorned with the spoils of the fresh- 
water seas, shells, green stones, agates, spar, and curi- 



 

ously shaped pebbles ; occasionally there was a stuffed 
water-bird, or a bright-colored print, and always a 
violin. Black-eyed children played in the water which 
bordered their narrow beach-gardens ; and slender 
women, with shining black hair, stood in their door- 
ways knitting. I found my laundress, and then went 
on to Jeannette's home, the last house in the row. 
From the mother, a Chippewa woman, I learned that 
Jeannette was with her French father at the fishing- 
grounds off Drummond's Island. 

" How long has she been away ? " I asked. 

" Veeks four," replied the mother, whose knowledge 
of English was confined to the price-list of white-fish 
and blueberries, the two articles of her traffic with the 
boarding-house keepers. 

" When will she return ? " 

"Je n y sais" 

She knitted on, sitting in the sunshine on her little 
doorstep, looking out over the western water with 
tranquil content in her beautiful, gentle eyes. As I 
walked up the beach I glanced back several times to 
see if she had the curiosity to watch me ; but no, she 
still looked out over the western water. What was I 
to her ? Less than nothing. A white-fish was more. 

A week or two later I strolled out to the Giant's 
Stairway and sat down in the little rock chapel. 
There was a picnic at the Lovers' Leap, and I had 
that side of the island to myself. I was leaning back, 



 

half asleep, in the deep shadow, when the sound of 
voices roused me; a birch-bark canoe was passing 
close in shore, and two were in it, Jeannette and our 
surgeon. I could not hear their words, but I noticed 
Kodney's expression as he leaned forward. Jeannette 
was paddling slowly ; her cheeks were flushed, and her 
eyes brilliant. Another moment, and a point hid them 
from my view. I went home troubled. 

" Did you enjoy the picnic, Miss Augusta ?" I said, 
with assumed carelessness, that evening. "Dr. Pres- 
cott was there, as usual, I suppose ? " 

" He was not present, but the picnic was highly en- 
joyable," replied Miss Augusta, in her even voice and 
impartial manner. 

" The Doctor has not been with us for some days," 
said the major's wife, archly ; " I suspect he does not 
like Mr. Piper." 

Mr. Piper was a portly widower, of sanguine com- 
plexion, a Chicago produce-dealer, who was supposed 
to admire Miss Augusta, and was now going through 
a course of " The Harp that once." 

The last days of summer flew swiftly by ; the sur- 
geon held himself aloof ; we scarcely saw him in the 
garrison circles, and I no longer met him in my 
rambles. 

" Jealousy ! " said the major's wife. 

September came. The summer visitors fled away 
homeward ; the remaining " Indian curiosities " were 



 

stored away for another season ; the hotels were closed, 
and the forests deserted ; the bluebells swung unmo- 
lested on their heights, and the plump Indian-pipes 
grew in peace in their dark corners. The little white 
fort, too, began to assume its winter manners ; the 
storm-flag was hoisted ; there were evening fires upon 
the broad hearth-stones ; the chaplain, having finished 
everything about Balak, his seven altars and seven 
rams, was ready for chess-problems ; books and papers 
were ordered; stores laid in, and anxious inquiries 
made as to the " habits " of the new mail-carrier, 
for the mail-carrier was the hero of the winter, and 
if his " habits " led him to whiskey, there was danger 
that our precious letters might be dropped all along 
the northern curve of Lake Huron. 

Upon this quiet matter-of-course preparation, sud- 
denly, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, came or- 
ders to leave. The whole garrison, officers and men, 
were ordered to Florida. 

In a moment all was desolation. It was like being 
ordered into the Valley of the Shadow of Death. 
Dense everglades, swamp-fevers, malaria in the air, 
poisonous underbrush, and venomous reptiles and in- 
sects, and now and then a wily unseen foe picking off 
the men, one by one, as they painfully cut out roads 
through the thickets, these were the features of mil- 
itary life in Florida at that period. Men who would 
have marched boldly to the cannon's mouth, officers 



 

who would have headed a forlorn hope, shrank from 
the deadly swamps. 

Families must be broken up, also; no women, no 
children, could go to Florida. There were tears and 
the sound of sobbing in the little white fort, as the 
poor wives, all young mothers, hastily packed their 
few possessions to go back to their fathers' houses, 
fortunate if they had fathers to receive them. The 
husbands went about in silence, too sad for words. 
Archie kept up the best courage; but he was young, 
and had no one to leave save me. 

The evening of the fatal day for the orders had 
come in the early dawn I was alone in my little 
parlor, already bare and desolate with packing-cases. 
The wind had been rising since morning, and now 
blew furiously from the west. Suddenly the door 
burst open and the surgeon entered. I was shocked 
at his appearance, as, pale, haggard, with disordered 
hair and clothing, he sank into a chair, and looked at 
me in silence. 

" Eodney, what is it ? " I said. 

He did not answer, but still looked at me with that 
strange gaze. Alarmed, I rose and went toward him, 
laying my hand on his shoulder with a motherly touch. 
I loved the quiet, gray-eyed youth next after Archie. 

" What is it, my poor boy ? Can I help you ? " 

"O Aunt Sarah, perhaps you can, for you know her." 

" Her ? " I repeated, with sinking heart. 



 

" Yes. Jeannette." 

I sat down and folded my hands ; trouble had come, 
but it was not what I apprehended, the old story of 
military life, love, and desertion ; the ever-present bal- 
lad of the "gay young knight who loves and rides 
away." This was something different. 

" I love her, I love her madly, in spite of myself," 
said Eodney, pouring forth his words with feverish 
rapidity. " I know it is an infatuation, I know it is 
utterly unreasonable, and yet I love her. I have 
striven against it, I have fought with myself, I have 
written out elaborate arguments wherein I have clearly 
demonstrated the folly of such an affection, and I have 
compelled myself to read them over slowly, word for 
word, when alone in my own room, and yet I love 
her ! Ignorant, I know she would shame me ; shal- 
low, I know she could not satisfy me ; as a wife she 
would inevitably drag me down to misery, and yet I 
love her ! I had not been on the island a week before 
I saw her, and marked her beauty. Months before 
you invited her to the fort I had become infatuated 
with her singular loveliness ; but, in some respects, 
a race of the blood-royal could not be prouder than 
these French fishermen. They will accept your money, 
they will cheat you, they will tell you lies for an extra 
shilling ; but make one step toward a simple acquaint- 
ance, and the door will be shut in your face. They 
will bow down before you as a customer, but they will 



 

not have you for a friend. Thus I found it impossible 
to reach Jeannette. I do not say that I tried, for all 
the time I was fighting myself; but I went far enough 
to see the barriers. It seemed a fatality that you 
should take a fancy to her, have her here, and ask me 
to admire her, admire the face that haunted me by 
day and by night, driving me mad with its beauty. 

" I realized my danger, and called to my aid all the 
pride of my race. I said to my heart, ' You shall not 
love this ignorant half-breed girl to your ruin.' I rea- 
soned with myself, and said, ' It is only because you 
are isolated on this far-away island. Could you pre- 
sent this girl to your mother ? Could she be a com- 
panion for your sisters ? ' I was beginning to gain 
a firmer control over myself, in spite of her presence, 
when you unfolded your plan of education. Fatality 
again. Instantly a crowd of hopes surged up. The 
education you began, could I not finish ? She was but 
young; a few years of careful teaching might work 
wonders. Could I not train this forest flower so that 
it could take its place in the garden? But, when I 
actually saw this full-grown woman unable to add the 
simplest sum or write her name correctly, I was again 
ashamed of my infatuation. It is one thing to talk 
of ignorance, it is another to come face to face with it. 
Thus I wavered, at one moment ready to give up all 
for pride, at another to give up all for love. 

" Then came the malicious suggestion of negro blood. 



 

Could it be proved, I was free ; that taint I could not 
pardon. [And here, even as the surgeon spoke, I 
noticed this as the peculiarity of the New England 
Abolitionist. Theoretically he believed in the equality 
of the enslaved race, and stood ready to maintain the 
belief with his life, but practically he held himself 
entirely aloof from them; the Southern creed and 
practice were the exact reverse.] I made inquiries 
of Father Piret, who knows the mixed genealogy of 
the little Trench colony as far back as the first voya- 
geurs of the fur trade, and found as I, shall I say 
hoped or feared ? that the insinuation was utterly 
false. Thus I was thrown back into the old tumult. 
" Then came that evening in this parlor when Jean- 
nette made the coffee and baked little cakes over the 
coals. Do you remember the pathos with which she 
chanted File, file, pauvre Marie; File, jtte, pour le 
prisonnier ? Do you remember how she looked when 
she repeated ' Ivry ' ? Did that tender pity, that ring- 
ing inspiration, come from a dull mind and shallow* 
heart? I was avenged of my enforced disdain, my 
love gave itself up to delicious hope. She was capable 
of education, and then ! I made a pretext of old 
Antoine's cough in order to gain an opportunity of 
speaking to her alone ; but she was like a thing pos- 
sessed, she broke from me and sprang over the icy 
cliff, her laugh coming back on the wind as I followed 
her down the dangerous slope. On she rushed, jump- 




ing from rock to rock, waving her hand in wild glee 
when the moon shone out, singing and shouting with 
merry scorn at my desperate efforts to reach her. It 
was a mad chase, but only on the plain below could 
I come up with her. There, breathless and eager, I 
unfolded to her my plan of education. I only went 
so far as this : I was willing to send her to school, 
to give her opportunities of seeing the world, to pro- 
vide for her whole future. I left the story of my love 
to come afterward. She laughed me to scorn. As 
well talk of education to the bird of the wilderness ! 
She rejected my offers, picked up snow to throw in 
my face, covered me with her French sarcasms, danced 
around me in circles, laughed, and mocked, until I was 
at a 'loss to know whether she was human. Finally, 
as a shadow darkened the moon, she fled away ; and 
when it passed she was gone, and I was alone on the 
snowy plain. 

" Angry, fierce, filled with scorn for myself, I deter- 
mined resolutely to crush out my senseless infatuation. 
I threw myself into such society as we had ; I assumed 
an interest in that inane Miss Augusta; I read and 
studied far into the night ; I walked until sheer fatigue 
gave me tranquillity ; but all I gained was lost in that 
encounter at the Arch : you remember it ? When I 
saw her on that narrow bridge, my love burst its bonds 
again, and, senseless as ever, rushed to save her, to 
save her, poised on her native rocks, where every inch 



 

was familiar from childhood ! To save her, sure- 
footed and light as a bird ! I caught her. She strug- 
gled in my arms, angrily, as an imprisoned animal 
might struggle, but so beautiful ! The impulse came 
to me to spring with her into the gulf below, and so 
end the contest forever. I might have done it, I 
cannot tell, but, suddenly, she wrenched herself out 
of my arms and fled over the Arch, to the farther side. 
I followed, trembling, blinded, with the violence of my 
emotion. At that moment I was ready to give up my 
life, my soul, into her hands. 

" In the woods beyond she paused, glanced over her 
shoulder toward me, then turned eagerly. ' Voilci? she 
said, pointing. I looked down and saw several silver 
pieces that had dropped from my pocket as I sprang 
over the rocks, and, with an impatient gesture, I thrust 
them aside with my foot. 

"' Nonj she cried, turning toward me and stooping 
eagerly, 'so much! O, so much! See! four shil- 
lings ! ' Her eyes glistened with longing as she held 
the money in her hand and fingered each piece lov- 
ingly. 

"The sudden revulsion of feeling produced by her 
words and gesture filled me with fury. ' Keep it, and 
buy yourself a soul if you can ! ' I cried ; and turning 
away, I left her with her gains. 

" ' Merci, monsieur? she answered gayly, all unmind- 
ful of my scorn ; and off she ran, holding her treasure 

 



 

tightly clasped in both hands. I could hear her sing- 
ing far down the path. 

"It is a bitter thing to feel a scorn for yourself! 
Did I love this girl who stooped to gather a few shil- 
lings from under my feet ? Was it, then, impossible 
for me to conquer this ignoble passion ? No ; it could 
not and it should not be ! I plunged again into all 
the gayety; I left myself not one free moment; if 
sleep came not, I forced it to come with opiates ; 
Jeannette had gone to the fishing-grounds, the weeks 
passed, I did not see her. I had made the hardest 
struggle of all, and was beginning to recover my self- 
respect when, one day, I met her in the woods with 
some children ; she had returned to gather blueberries. 
I looked at her. She was more gentle than usual, and 
smiled. Suddenly, as an embankment which has with- 
stood the storms of many winters gives way at last in 
a calm summer night, I yielded. Without one outward 
sign, I laid down my arms. Myself knew that the 
contest was over, and my other self rushed to her feet. 

"Since then I have often seen her; I have made 
plan after plan to meet her; I have degrading 
thought ! paid her to take me out in her canoe, under 
the pretence of fishing. I no longer looked forward ; 
I lived only in the present, and thought only of when 
and where I could see her. Thus it has been until this 
morning, when the orders came. Now, I am brought 
face to face with reality ; I must go ; can I leave her 



 

behind ? For hours I have been wandering in the 
woods. Aunt Sarah, it is of no use, I cannot live 
without her ; I must marry her." 

" Marry Jeannette ! " I exclaimed. 

" Even so." 

" An ignorant half-breed ? " 

" As you say, an ignorant half-breed." 

" You are mad, Eodney." 
" " I know it." . 

I will not repeat all I said ; but, at last, silenced, if 
not convinced, by the power of this great love, I started 
with him out into the wild night to seek Jeannette. 
We went through the village and round the point, 
where the wind met us, and the waves broke at our 
feet with a roar. Passing the row of cabins, with their 
twinkling lights, we reached the home of Jeannette 
and knocked at the low door. The Indian mother 
opened it. I entered, without a word, and took a seat 
near the hearth, where a drift-wood fire was burning. 
Jeannette came forward with a surprised look. "You 
little think what good fortune is coming to you, child," 
I thought, as I noted her coarse dress and the poor 
furniture of the little room. 

Eodney burst at once into his subject. 

"Jeannette," he said, going toward her, "I have come 
to take you away with me. You need not go to school; 
I have given up that idea, I accept you as you 
are. You shall have silk dresses and ribbons, like the 



 

ladies at the Mission-House this summer. You shall 
see all the great cities, you shall hear beautiful music. 
You shall have everything you want, money, bright 
shillings, as many as you wish. See! Mrs. Corlyne 
has come with me to show you that it is true. This 
morning we had orders to leave Mackinac ; in a few 
days we must go. But listen, Jeannette ; I will 
marry you. You shall be my wife. Do not look so 
startled. I mean it; it is really true." 

" Qu'est-ce-que-c'est ? " said the girl, bewildered by 
the rapid, eager words. 

"Dr. Prescott wishes to marry you, child," I ex- 
plained, somewhat sadly, for never had the disparity 
between them seemed so great. The presence of the 
Indian mother, the common room, were like silent 
protests. 

" Marry ! " ejaculated Jeannette. 

" Yes, love," said the surgeon, ardently. " It is quite 
true ; you shall be my wife. Father Piret shall marry 
us. I will exchange into another regiment, or, if ne- 
cessary, I will resign. Do you understand what I am 
saying, Jeannette? See! I give you my hand, in 
token that it is true." 

But, with a quick bound, the girl was across the 
room. " What ! " she cried. " You think I marry you ? 
Have you not heard of Baptiste ? Know, then, that 
I love one finger of him more than all you, ten times, 
hundred times." 



 

"Baptiste?" repeated Eodney. 

" Oui, mon cousin, Baptiste, the fisherman. "We 
marry soon tenez la fete de Saint Andr&"
