that hundreds of other slights should be laid on the divine 
altar of love by souls not worthy to be admitted within the 
doors of the temple ! It wounds her. She has a high and 
sacred estimate of love, higher now than it was a year ago. 
What if circumstances had been otherwise and she had 
listened. He would have loved her up to his light. She 
cannot imagine his being consciously cruel, but the time of 
indifference — when he will love another — why, perhaps 
he may be some woman's husband now, this very day ; be 
plodding to and fro in his workman's garb, his grimy hands 
— she remembers that his hands were wonderfully well 
shapen and soft. She cooks the meals, sweeps the house, 
does her marketing, mending, turns -and makes over her 
gowns, repairs the frayed edges of coats, sews on buttons, 
and gossips with her neighbors. A loyal lover ! The 
birds seem warbling it; somehow, the very winds rustle to 
that refrain. What was she going to put down in this 
corner by thi= slim young birch ? 



 

"T think I will go in and practise a while," she says to 
her mother. « Somehow, I can't get on with the painting 
this morning." 

She takes up a diificult exercise. No " loyal lover " can 
creep into this. 

Is there some curious clairvoyance between souls ? The 
new names mean the same unexplainable power. This 
brilliant May morning a- man steps off the train, asks a 
direction, and, following it, makes the proper turn. Here 
is the court-house. And here is Court Street, the first 
block pretty well filled with lawyers' offices. He studies 
the signs — " TJpham & Sayre," then he enters, and asks if 
he can see Mr. Sayre. 

" Will he be seated ? Mr. Sayre will be at liberty in ten 
minutes." 

He nods affirmatively, but stands for some time in the 
doorway looking over at the park. Great rugged elms 
there are with here and there a handful of young twigs 
growing out of the gnarled boles, and glancing up at the 
ragged branches overhead. They must be very old, he 
thinks. The younger ones, mature themselves, flaunt their 
straightness and their long feathery arms at the others. 
Maples, beeches, evergreens in great variety, two or three 
silver birches, some sturdy oaks, dogwoods in bloom, and 
here a Judas tree with its suggestion of purple. Trodden 
paths cross it diagoually ; straight ones, too, flagged — 
perhaps those most used. A soft turf, rather sparse in the 
shady places, but here and there a patch of emerald green 
in the sunshine. Ah, how beautiful ! And there are thou- 
sands of souls who will never see anything like it this side 
of heaven. The man sighs. 

He is a tall, strongly made young fellow of eight or nine 
and twenty, with a sort of assertive figure, as if he was 
quite sure of the capabilities of his physique; one that 
men recognize immediately ; endurance, not simply negSr 
tive strength that may brace itself for a shock, but the 
intelligent, active power. His arms are long and well 
shaped, his hands the kind that express tenacity, yet also 





a curious gentleness, that can smooth the pillow of the 
sick or hold, an enemy at bay. Now and then one sees 
hands with a startling capability of expression. 

The face is not handsome, but clean-cut, vigorous, with a 
kind of eagerness that indicates continual action rather 
than repose. There is the vehemence of youth, tempered 
by a kind of shrewd philosophy glancing in the eyes which 
would be grave, even sorrowful, without it. They are very 
dark, but not black. The dark hair is shorn close, the 
mustache is much lighter, and has ends that almost curl. 
Tlie chin is broad, determined. 

He has been watching a beautiful little chipmunk run up 
and down a tree, and occasionally disappear in a hollow. 
The smile illumines his face like a sunrise. Then there is 
a stir within. The client leaves the inner office, and the 
stranger turns, crosses the room, and is ushered within. 
He searches his coat pocket, and draws therefrom a bit of 
torn newspaper. 

" This is your advertisement, I belive, for heirs to the 
Bradley estate ? " 

" Yes," answers Mr. Sayre. " Be seated," and he makes 
a polite gesture toward the vacant chair. " Are you " — 

" I am interested in a way," he replies with a certain 
pleasant indifference. " Have any of the heirs been found ? 
I say heirs — you have put it in the collective." 

" Yes," says Mr. Sayre. " There are two still wanting — 
or some certain word of their death." 

" Was there — a Mrs. Hal ford " — 

" Mrs. Halford is one of the heirs," in a quiet tone. 

" And — if the others appear — does it make any differ- 
ence with her share ? " he asks eagerly. 
. " Oh, no, not at all. Well, if we proved to the satisfaction
of the law that they were dead, the estate would be 
divided among the living ones." 

" And if these other people simply did not appear ? " 

"Their part would be held in abeyance until the pre- 
Sum])tion of their death proved convincing.'' 

" And it can make no diilerence to Mrs. Halford ? " 



 

He wants to be certified again. Then he adds, — 

" Mrs. Halford is the heir, not her daughters ? " 

" She was a niece of old Silas Bradley. All the others 
of the second generation, I think, must be dead, unless it 
is Morton Bradley. We are looking in the third. We 
have found one grandniece also. The descendants of Mary 
Bradley, married name Winterburne, and this Morton are 
the subjects of our remaining inquiry." 

" She went to Cohasset and died some five years later," 
remarks the young man. " She had two children, but the 
infant daughter died also. Otis Winterburne married and 
had one son, then died. His widow moved away, married 
a Joseph Hilliard, had one daughter, and some ten years 
later she died." 

"Exactly," says Mr. Sayre, pleased to see it put so 
tersely. " And this young Winterburne, though he must 
have reached manhood some years since, is the person we 
are search'ng for. He has a half sister, you say ? " 

" And he would take " — 

" One quarter of the estate." 

The young man seems to consider. If he were dead 
without a will, would his half sister be his natural heir ? 
His mother surely would. Well, he does not make Eegiua 
Halford any poorer by claiming his rights. 

"I am Norman Winterburne," he says very simply. "I 
have generally gone by my step-father's name ; he preferred 
it when I was small. He was a good father to me." 

There is a respect in this, a manly honesty that appeals 
to the lawyer, and wins his favor. 

"That is where the clew was lost in tracing you out," 
he returns briskly. Then he studies the young man atten- 
tively, who sits composedly under the scrutiny. He is 
impressed by his general bearing, his fine physique, his 
clear complexion, well opened, fearless eyes, that carry in 
them an expression of only half-veiled tenderness. 

Hilliard nods in the pause. 

" You have your proofs ? The law is an insistent 
master." 





"Yes; it's rather odd. I had been skirmishing around 
among iron mines in Pennsylvania for some months. On 
my return, I went to visit my sister, and she had found 
this in an old paper, — how old we could not tell. I didn't 
think at first it could mean me. I did not know that I had 
any relations good enough to leave me a fortune." 

"H« didn't will it," comments the lawyer with a dry 
smile. " What Mr. Bradley's intention concerning his 
money really was will remain unknown to us. No doubt 
this is as satisfactory, however." 

" I understood at first that the whole estate was to the 
Halfords. It is only within a few days that I heard of 
the division," and he glances up still questioningly. 

" Quite a mistake, as you must see when the man died 
intestate. The house and the farm will be kept until — 
well, I have faith now in the return of the missing Bradley 
even. Having the family name, it seems only just' that he 
should have the first choice. As all the rest is personal 
property it can be apportioned without any difficulty. I 
have paid out the two shares ; yours can be taken any 
time with accrued interest." 

"We are all — relatives," the young man says with a 
peculiar smile. 

"Yes. That does not necessarily cause agreement, but 
I hope you may all prove friendly. You will be certain to 
like the Halfords — you will doubtless desire to meet them. 
Are you residing at a distance ? " 

"For a month or so I have been at Warwick. Some 
business there has interested me." 

"Ah, so near?" Mr. Sayre has half a mind to propose a 
walk up the hill to Bradley House, then he studies the 
young man again. There is nothing objectionable in him 
that he can see, yet perhaps it would be more compli- 
mentary to consult the ladies first. " Have you the neces- 
sary documents with you ? " he asks almost immediately. 

"No, I haven't. My sister has the family relics in her 
possession. I will send for them at once." 

Then he rises. There are no further questions that he 



 

can ask about the Halfords without betraying his previous 
knowledge of them. It is altogether within Miss Halford's 
province to say whether the friendship shall be renewed. 
He has the obstinate faith of a man that most things do 
come about, though his future purposes have been quite 
undefined to himself. Then the whole year has been so 
full of exciting matters to him. 

" When they come," referring to the papers, " shall I 
drop you a line ? " 

" Yes, if you will. Then we shall be sure of no delay." 

" Good-morning," says Hilliard, and the lawyer wishes 
him a pleasant adieu. After all, thinks Mr. Sayre, he has 
yet to prove his claim. 

It is like a dream when Hilliard steps out intp the 
fragrant sunshine. Not the mere fact of money, though 
Heaven knows he is glad enough to have that. It would 
take a long while to accumulate the. sum by plodding 
industry, and though he has gripped the lowest round' of 
fortune, money will help him tp run up the ladder more 
nimbly. But the strange part is his connection with the 
Halfords, his being brought back so curiously within 
Regina's orbit. 

Hilliard consults his watch and decides he will lose the 
next train, if needs be, in a venture. He skirts the side of 
the park — what a picturesque old town it is, to be sure ! 
He inquires of a- lad the direction to Bradley House, and 
finds it quite a walk, but he is fond of walking. He rumi- 
nates in a chaotic fashion, listening to the singing of innu- 
merable birds, glancing admiringly at half century old 
trees as if he longed to stop and shake the end of a bough 
as if it were a friendly hand. There are great clumps of 
shrubbery in bloom, fruit trees that are perfect mounds of 
whiteness, or the pinks and reds of apple blossoms. Pretty 
yards in their garniture of frailer flowers, urns and vases 
with trailing vines and bright red gypsy pots swinging 
from their tripods. The only drawback is there are so 
many alike. One cannot keep up the same kind of ad- 
miratiou continuously. The little perked up story and a 





half cottage, dingy, and with a disreputable lean-to, and 
untrimmed, tangled bushes and vines is a relief. He comes 
out to the picturesque stream, crosses the bridge and keeps 
on, his eyes wandering to that eastward, gently sloping 
ascent. With the curious sense of two distinct individuali- 
ties, one here and the other living over the autumn when he 
first saw Kegina Halford — one Sunday evening at tea at her 
friend's. Her gown was a curious metallic blue, — he would 
hardly have remembered any other color, — and instead 
of the usual bands of linen she had a soft fall of lace at 
neck and wrists. And all, the winter, — when he had come 
to watch her, and wish he knew how to make things easier 
for her. Mrs. Bowen's incautious sympathy had revealed 
many of the straits and pinches. Cynthia's frank railing 
at poverty amused him. Regina made no sign as to any 
part or lot in the matter. He had a curious chivalry con- 
cerning the sex, that he understood was quite old-fash- 
ioned. He hated to think of any woman really struggling 
for bread, and fighting for it was pitiful. He wanted them 
all in pretty homes, with leisure to keep themselves sweet, 
attractive, and winsome. Marriage did not always do it, 
he observed. When there was baking and ironing and 
cooking, Mrs. Bo wen was flushed and tired, — yes, rather 
cross sometimes, not snappish ; she had a pleasant temper, 
but that strain of physical fatigue that reacted upon the 
nerves. He had studied it elsewhere. He had fancied 
once he should like to be a physician, then he shrank back 
appalled at the idea that he must witness suffering, must 
treat it even and smile hopefully over it when there was 
no cure, when death stood at his elbow. And there were 
other ills, — poverty, anxiety ; he could not look upon 
them in the light of blessings — they were forced upon one 
by circumstances. Did it please God, he wondered, that 
some poor woman should toil till past midnight, and lie 
sleepless on her pillow till dawn, thinking how to-morrow's 
bread was to be gained ? 

He used to dream of Eegina Halford under more favor- 
able circumstances, in a beautiful home ; yes, he would like 



luxury for her. A warm and fragrant atmosphere, trailing 
gowns of soft, flowing white, beautiful furniture, pictures, 
music, the little stir of going and coming, of receiving 
friends graciously, as she could, of sitting in the twilight 
by a grate fire, the soft shadows playing all about her, of 
some one coming — yes, there must be a lover or a husband, 
a woman's existence was incomplete without love, and hers 
must be blissfully happy. He was not jealous of this tall, 
strong, imperious but generous lover at first. When it 
came that the room grew smaller, the appointments less 
sumptuous, her gowns more simple, he hardljj remembered. 
The poems read were the ones he was so fond of. The 
books — how did he know she would be fond of scientific 
things, of social problems that were stirring up the world ? 
Does a man dream himself in love when on the other side 
is the hard, steady effort of his own ambitions ? Hilliard 
did. Then he waited for the intangible sign, — not that 
she loved, but that he might draw nearer, might share her 
cares and assume some of her burdens. 

He had not paid any especial attention to the fact that 
there was some property left them, — an old country house 
somewhere. Just at this time he was studying at a great 
problem that was to advance his own fortunes. There was 
a vague idea in his mind that they would sell the place — 
a few delicate women could not manage a farm. And the 
certain knowledge that they were going away, that she 
would not be here in the same city, that he could not drop 
in and spend an hour watching her, suddenly shaped and 
crystallized his desires, brought so strange a knowledge 
that at first it seemed almost pain, a delicious throe of that 
divine agony when love is born after long waiting and 
watching. 

He had stumbled on the occasion while his pulses were 
still seething in ardent tumult; he had blundered too. 
True, he had not meant to ask for her love, only to confess 
his, and wait in generous loyalty. The utter surprise 
stunned him. Of course he did not mean to give up his 
hopes, only to settle upon some better way. Presently he 





understood that the change in her life was to be greateir 
than anything he could give her at this period. He must 
not only wait but work. When he recovered himself a 
little, he went at both bravely. 

And now, if this share of the fortune could go directly to 
her, he would not take a step in the matter, though it is an 
absolute factor in his advancement. It will bring to him 
the very prosperity he dreamed of for her sake. It can- 
not fail to draw them together in a friendly way, to put 
them on a footing where all the sequences will come in 
naturally. 

He pauses suddenly. The Hardins' cottage is in sight, 
and here is the winding avenue. He does not mean to go 
up boldly and storm the fortress to-day, so he makes a little 
detour, and finds himself in a grassj' orchard, where the 
soft winds shake about a shower of blossom leaves. Ah, 
how fragrant, how beautiful ! A thrill speeds through his 
pulses as- he remembers that he, too, has some rights in 
this old gray stone house, that his ancestors as well as 
hers lived here. He hears the sounds of music throbbing 
on the air ; he sees one figure sitting on the porch, and he 
knows at another glance who it is. And the easel — yes, 
she is drifting into the life of leisurely delight he dreamed 
for her, but he has not brought it to her. Ah, what can he 
give her now ? He is as helpless in his love as he was 
more than a year agone. 

The sound of the piano ceases. Kegina Halford comes 
to the doorway in some soft, light, clinging attire, tall, 
lithesome as a young nymph. Did he think her beautiful 
before ? He cannot clearly remember, but she is beauti- 
ful now in her slim stateliness. What a picture she 
makes in that dark old frame with the dim background. 
Ah, what shall he do to win her in this changed atmos- 
phere ? 

He turns away and steals over the slope, down to the 
load. The buttevoups dazzle in the sunshine as the wind 
blows them about. Everything seems tremulous with a 



 

wonderful sense of loveliness. Hfe has seen her again. 
He will always love her, come what may. He is too 
sturdy, too determined to look long on the-dark side, and he 
has an abiding faith that fortune holds a good deal for him 
in her golden hand. It is the persistent who win. 







CHAETEK. VI 

FATHER AND SON 

Having given your mind p)ay with subtlety, revolve your affairs little by 
little. — Abistofhanes. 

Norman Hilliard finds that by a slight intervention of 
fate he has not lost his train. There has been a deten- 
tion further up the road. He paces the i)latform slowly, 
his eyes taking in the picture opposite, the lazy river flow- 
ing between. Here it broadens out, up a distance it nar- 
rows again, and he can hear a dim rush of some rapids. 
There is a covered bridge with the quaintness of thirty 
years agone. Opposite the rocky ridge rises higher and 
higher, the narrow ledges jjause as' if they had stopped to 
take breath in their ascent, and the green arms of Nature 
had prisoned them for an instant, long enough to start a bit 
of vegetation, a hazy bluish green strip of bushes and 
stunted cedars and straggling young trees that at a later 
growth must lose their slender hold and go toppling over. 
The soft purples are slashed by openings of silvery gray ; 
there are touches of vivid greens still in their spring glory ; 
there are browns of every hue ; the granite rocks sparkle as 
if set with gems, which, after all, are mostly deceptive 
mica. What a picture it is ! 

The up-train winds around a bend in the river that one 
can see distinctly here. It is lost to sight a moment, but 
not to sound. There is a little stir, the freight truck is 
run out, and a breath of expectation seems to pervade the 
stragglers. The train slows up, stops. There is one pas- 
senger to get on, three or four huddle out of one end of the 
car, then a young man who turns and puts out his hand to 
steady an elderly companion, who may be his father. The 
act has such a kindly, every-day grace that Hilliard notes 



 

them both. They come up the platform and watch till a 
trunk and a box is taken off. 

The younger man is in a certain way handsome. He 
would be effeminate but for his size, which is fully up to 
the average. There is a wonderful litheness of contour that 
shows in every movement, makes liim look slenderer than 
he really is. His figure is perfect enough for a model. 
The hands are slim enough for a woman, white, soft, of 
course,-with long fingers and pink nails. There is a luxu- 
rious air about him that at once removes him from any sus- 
picion of manual labor. A fine, fair skin, a straight nose 
with quivering nostrils, a golden-brown mustache, silky and 
curling at the long ends, and a bit of light-brown hair 
showing the same tendency to gold perceptible in it, but it 
has none of the reddish tints. There is a curious quality 
in the face that attracts Hilliard, that repels him also, or 
at least gives him a touch of distrust, a kind of mystery 
rather than reticence, not strong enough indeed for the 
latter. 

The elder man is as tall but slightly bent, is pale and 
fragile, and glances about in a questioning manner, as if 
fearful everything was not quite right. His hair is silvery, 
his beard somewhat long and straggling, and of a silky 
whiteness. The nose is straight as the other's, and has the 
same flexibility, the eyes are furtive, the skin full of fine 
wrinkles, and he looks like quite an old man. As they 
stand talking, Hilliard studies them. He is fond of watch- 
ing people, and formulates theories about them when he 
has a leisure moment like this. How true his theories may 
be he seldom has an opportunity of knowing. Oddly 
enough he rarely sets out to analyze the people he likes. 

Before these two have finished their consultation his 
train comes along, and he is whirled away with the picture 
still in his mind. They are unusual people, and they haunt 
him in a baffling, elusive way. Later ou he feels like call- 
ing it a presentiment. 

"We want our dinner. The hotel will be best," says 
the young man to his companion. 





"Dinner — oh, yes," with a thin little laugh. "There 
would be small chance of dinner at Bradley House, I sup- 
pose. I wonder whether it is closed? But we'll soon 
change all that. It should have been mine twenty years 
ago. No one else has any real right. We will walk in 
and take possession, the last of our name, my son. For 
the women couldn't carry that. And they were paid their 
part," rubbing his thin, wrinkled hands. 

The younger makes some inquiries of the station agent. 
A hotel is near. There are people living in Bradley 
House, some of the heirs. 

The brows knit on hearing this last. He rejoins his 
father, and the two walk a short distance to the hotel, 
which has a rural but inviting appearance. They take a 
room and free themselves from the defilements of travel, 
then find a very appetizing dinner set before them, with a 
clean cloth and napkins. The elder man has a capricious 
appetite. When he has eaten all that his son can gently 
•force upon him, and emptied his glass of wine, the younger 
glances around cautiously. 

"Bradley House is tenanted," he says in a low, soft 
voice as if his purpose was to disarm. " Some of the heirs 
are there. There may have been a will, you know." 

" I don't believe it ! " He doubles up his thin, wrinkled 
hapd, and would bring it down on the table, but the son's 
eye, ever on the alert, catches it. "Jasper, no one has 
any right, do you hear ? I have told you a hundred times 
that every one of them was paid her portion and went her 
way. Aunt Joanna did not like any of the marriages. 
They weren't the marrying kind, those old folks," and the 
vacant laugh is a little slirill, perhaps weakly vindictive. 
" You see, then, they have no right to a share " — 

" Unless there is a will," says the son impatiently. He 
has used this caution so many times. " According to the 
wording of the advertisement I should think not, but we 
cannot be sure until we know the facts. I have been con- 
sidering. It will be the wisest move to go at once to 
Bradley House." 



 

" Wisest — of course. I have been telling you so all the 
time. -Possession is nine points of the law, and it will be 
a difficult thing to dislodge its ; " and again his thin laugh 
ends his sentence rather triumphantly. 

Jasper Bradley looks out of the window into the quiet 
street. Through a space in the trees he sees the mountains 
over opposite with their nooks and innumerable tints. A 
sensation of restfulness has stolen over him — it may be 
possible his anxieties are at an end, but he hardly dare 
believe it so. He is tired, tired ; more weary and worn out 
than his twenty-six years give him. any right to be. 

" Well, let us go," insists the father, rising. 

"Wait." Jasper Bradley walks to the desk and pays 
his bill with a kind of elegant deliberation. Then he orders 
a hack sent to the station for the luggage, pacifying his 
father meanwhile, who betrays the impatience of a child. 

They are taken up presently and go leisurely through 
the pleasant streets. Morton Bradley's eyes are kindled to 
a glow of pleasurable interest as he recognizes familiar 
places and enumerates them. His face seems to gather a 
certain strength and reliance ; he holds his shoulders more 
erect. 

"Yes, yes," as they turn into the winding drive, the 
" lane " of old. " How nice it all looks ! It must have been 
freshened up a bit. Ninety years and more Uncle Silas 
lived here — and if I live to be that old — " 

They have reached the level, the clear open space, and 
the driver halt at the porch where the family are congre- 
gated. Jasper from the window takes in the picture. Two 
girls sit on the steps with some embroidery and bright- 
hued silks spread about in pretty confusion. The easel is 
there, but Regina is not painting. She has been reading
