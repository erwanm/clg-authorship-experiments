consternation.

“It sounds entrancing!” commented Blanche. “It savoreth of new dresses,
and, perchance, jewelry—peradventure, though that is a bold flight of
fancy, of a trip across the sea next summer.”

“Nothing has gone wrong, I hope, mother?” queried Emma.

“Nothing at all, my dear Lady Thoughtful,” was the smiling reply.

“Dear Lady Owl, you mean!” cried saucy Blanche, and she went off
singing:—

  “And what says the old gray owl?
      To who? To who?”

“Happy children!” Mrs. Hiller heaved a confidential sigh to the fire
that had shone on the young faces a moment ago. “Will what I have to
tell them make them less happy or gay? Is mine, after all, the needless
croak of the owl instead of a wise warning?”

The thought pierced her again, next day, when they met in her boudoir,
eager and curious, their eyes and cheeks unmarred by the moderate
dissipation of the preceding night. But she stood fast to her purpose;
unfolded her scheme in bulk and detail, with the assured tone of one
who had considered the cost to the last farthing. She was not accounted
an eccentric woman by her acquaintances, but her proposal was novel,
and, to her listeners, startling. Their days of school-study were
over, she reminded them. It was time that upon the foundation of
general information thus laid should be erected the superstructure of a
profession.

“A specialty, if you prefer the word,” she said; “since I earnestly
hope you will not be called upon to practice it for a livelihood. While
papa’s strength and health last, he finds no more delightful use for
his earnings than to purchase comfort and luxury for us. Were he to
die, or to be unfortunate in business, or become incurably diseased—and
such things are of almost daily occurrence—our style of living would
be at once and entirely altered. You would be driven to the study of
small, minute economies and false appearances, such as must rasp and
narrow the souls of those who resort to them; to escape these by a
marriage of convenience, or the lucky accident of a love-match, or
to engage, in earnest, in some business that would, thanks to your
previous training, continue to you the elegancies, with the decencies
of life.”

This was the preamble to an abstract of the conversation with her
husband, the troubled reverie and calculations that succeeded it.

“Of artists in music and painting, there are, perhaps, twenty in
this city,” she observed. “Of pretenders and drudges in these arts,
there are more than a thousand. Since not one of you has developed
any decided talent for such pursuits, or for literature, and, since
teaching for a living has become but another name for bondage and
starvation, my plan is this: You, Emma, shall learn bookkeeping;
Imogen, dressmaking; Blanche, millinery. Don’t look horrified! I
shall not expose you to the uncongenial associations or unwholesome
atmosphere of the crowded shop or work-room. All that affection and
money can do to make the term of your novitiate pleasant shall be done.
You shall fit up the old nursery as your academy of the useful arts, if
you choose to call it by so dignified a name. I shall engage competent
instructors for you and pay well for the lessons. But there must be no
play-work, no superficial, amateur performance on either side. When
your trades are learned, I shall expect you to keep yourselves in
practice, and up with the latest improvements and fashions by practice
in domestic manufactures. Milliners’ and dressmakers’ bills shall be
among the things that were. Emma shall have charge of the housekeeping
accounts and papa’s books. He will pay her as he would any other
skilful accountant, and what you, Imogen and Blanche, shall adjudge to
be a reasonable price for every dress and bonnet made for yourselves,
your sister, or for me.”

The, for once, dumb trio found simultaneous voice at this.

“Mamma! would that be right? Would it not be an imposition?”

“It is his own proposal. We talked it all over last night after he
came home, and again this morning. I need not tell you that he is the
best, most indulgent father that ever loved and spoiled three loving
daughters. I had some difficulty in persuading him to let me try the
experiment. The tears stood in his dear eyes, while he debated the
pros and cons of the case.

“‘My bonnie bairns!’ he said. ‘If I could, I would be their shield
always. They should never dream of privation; never ink or prick their
pretty fingers except for amusement, if I were sure of ten years more
of life and prosperity.’”

She stopped to steady her voice.

Imogen was crying outright; Emma’s gray eyes were cloudy. Blanche broke
forth, half-laughing, half-sobbing:—

“The angelic old papa! isn’t he a born seraph? I would peddle rags
with a lean mule, and a string of bells across the cart, to save him
an hour’s anxiety. I wish he would wear French hats—all flowers and
moonshine! And have four every season. Would not I furnish them for
nothing, kisses thrown into the bargain?”

The others had to laugh at the vision of papa’s six feet of stature,
broad shoulders, strong features, and iron-gray hair crowned with a
fancy hat of the prevailing mode. Mrs. Hiller went on:—

“‘But,’ he added, ‘I will not, while I can take care of them, derive
one cent’s profit from their work. There is no surer way of learning
how to take care of money than having money to manage. I will furnish
each of the pusses with a bank-book. She shall make out quarterly bills
against you, or me; deposit her gains in her own name, and invest
as she will. Her earnings may thus be the nest-egg of a neat little
fortune. I can’t imagine—I won’t believe that they will ever become
mercenary. But I am sick of the limpness and insipidity and general
know-nothingness of the women with whom I have business dealings.
‘My dear husband never suffered me to be annoyed by these matters,’
says the widow, her handkerchief to her eyes. And—‘If my poor papa
had foreseen this day, it would have embittered his life!’ sobs the
interesting spinster of forty-seven, who ‘hasn’t an idea how to make
out a checque,’ and really doesn’t know the difference between real and
personal estate!”

“The Payne girls!” uttered Imogen and Blanche, in wicked glee. “Mamma,
you ‘did’ Arethusa to the life.”

She resumed more seriously. “Something papa heard last night caused us
to lay this subject especially to heart. Doctor Jaynes says there is
no doubt that Mr. Sibthorpe is threatened with softening of the brain.
He has been doing extra work this winter—bookkeeping and copying in
the evenings, at home, as he could pick up such jobs, to eke out his
salary, and it has been too much for him. Nothing but absolute rest and
freedom from care can save him. Doctor Jaynes told him so plainly, and
he answered, with tears, that it was out of the question—he must die in
harness. It was natural that the news should interest and sadden us.”

“He has a very helpless family,” remarked Emma, compassionately.

“Because so many of them—all who are grown up—are girls!” cried
Blanche, impetuously. “That tells the whole story. And such a pitiful,
disgraceful, humiliating one it is! I could be ashamed of being a
woman. Mrs. Sibthorpe—indeed a majority of American mothers of the
genteeler sort, ought to turn pagans, and drown their baby-girls
as soon as they are born. That would be better than turning them
loose—great, overgrown babies, forever whining, with their fingers in
their mouths, over their feebleness, and timidity, and sentimental
ignorance—upon a grinning, or groaning public!”

“But how strange that we have never taken this subject into serious
consideration before,” said sensible Emma. “That other people do not,
is certain. Mother, you won’t mind if I ask you a question or two?”

“My precious child! as many as you like. I wish you to state every
objection frankly. You are of age, you know. I could not compel you to
adopt my suggestion, if I were disposed to do so. Nor will I coerce the
judgment of one of you three. We must go into this enterprise heartily
and all together, or not at all.”

“Will not our action excite much talk when it is known, give rise to
unpleasant surmises, and subject us to many impertinent inquiries?”

“Undoubtedly it will. We may as well prepare ourselves for this. And
the same kind guardians of their neighbors’ behavior and general
interests would buzz and sting yet more industriously were one of us to
sicken with small-pox, or the house to burn down to-morrow. Or, if papa
were to go off in a rapid consumption, they would bewail the number of
girls in our family as loudly and as delightedly as they will soon be
gossiping about poor, distraught Mr. Sibthorpe, and his quartette of
what Blanche calls overgrown babies; would dole out to us such charity
of word and deed as falls to the share of the Payne girls. My darlings,
if I could tell you how I long to see you independent of such changes
in fortune and fair-weather friends! each of you armed in herself to
meet reverses and to defy them, with GOD’S help and blessing upon those
who are trying to help themselves!”

Whatever error the tender mother may have made in her calculations of
what was to be risked, gained, and lost by the bold step she purposed,
she had not overrated the amount and quality of gossip caused by the
practical operation of her scheme. Stories, having “Mrs. Hiller’s queer
whim” for a starting-point, increased and multiplied, and flew over
the town like thistle-down in a windy September day. The mother was
a tyrant; the daughters were peculiar and strong-minded. The parents
refused to maintain their offspring because they were not sons, and
had informed them of their intention to bequeath every dollar of their
property to a Boys’ Orphan Asylum. The offspring disdained to be fed
and clothed by the hated parents. Mr. Hiller was insolvent; Mrs. Hiller
was insane; both were misers. The sisters were engaged to be married to
missionaries, and were bent upon engrafting the multifarious iniquities
of the modern and Christian woman’s garb upon the scantily-clothed
trunk of Ashantee, or Papuyan, or Root-digger fashions.

At first our heroines were annoyed, then diverted. In less than three
months they ceased to think of the babble at all, in their growing
interest in their active, varied home-life.

Just a year from the March night on which Mrs. Hiller had used so many
nautical figures in her speech and reverie, two cards were brought up
to the “academy of useful arts,” as the fair students therein persisted
in calling a large room at the back of the house. It was airy and
sunny, and, to-day, was full of life and enjoyment, for mother and
daughters were gathered there, and the chirping was like that of a
happily-crowded robin’s nest.

“The ladies say, do let ’em run right up, without ceremony,” reported
the servant.

“‘Arethusa Payne,’ and ‘Marietta Sibthorpe,’” read Blanche from the
cards. “Ask them to walk up to the work-room, Jane. Mind that you say
‘the work-room.’” As the amused girl left the chamber, the young lady
continued: “An Inspection Committee! Let them come! Won’t I make them
open their eyes, though?”

“I had no idea you were engaged with a dressmaker. I am afraid we
intrude,” simpered Miss Payne, tiptoeing, like a cautious hen, between
Blanche’s work-stand, piled with bonnet frames and linings, and
Imogen’s, down which flowed a river of silken flounces, half gathered
at the top; noting likewise, by turning her sharp face to the right,
then the left, as she stepped (still like an inquisitive Partlet), that
Emma’s tall desk, with a ledger open upon it, was in a corner.

Mrs. Hiller was ripping up a black silk dress; Emma was pulling a
velvet hat to pieces.

“Only practising our trades a little in furbishing up things; giving
a spring-ish look to hats and gowns,” rejoined Blanche, with saucy
politeness. “One gets so sick of winter clothes!”

“Dear me, how convenient! What a source of amusement it must be to have
that sort of knack!” said Miss Sibthorpe, self-compassionately. “It is
a genuine talent, isn’t it now? downright genius! And can you actually
make a hat, Blanche! I couldn’t put a bit of ribbon on mine to save
my life!”

“But we are professionals,” put in Imogen. “You have no idea how
we have worked to acquire the artistic touch. We had Miss Tiptop’s
forewoman with us at the country cottage we rented last summer, all the
‘dull season,’ on purpose to teach me dressmaking, besides the lessons
I had had in town. Blanche ran down to the city every week for an
all-day lesson.”

“But how very odd!” ejaculated Arethusa.

“That people should pay such exorbitant milliners’ bills all their
lives, when they could learn the business with one-fourth the labor
and in one-tenth of the time music requires?” Blanche said, in wilful
misunderstanding, setting her head on one side, and holding her
unfinished hat off at arm’s length to examine the effect. “It is queer,
as you say. I’ll be generous, girls. I’ll give you instructions, if
you wish—take you as my apprentices. I should enjoy it hugely.”

Both laughed shrilly and affectedly, to disguise the offence her
proposal gave them.

“I haven’t the least taste for such employment,” said Arethusa.

“You are very kind, but my social engagements are so numerous!”
pleaded Marietta. “Honestly, what do you do it for? You can’t really
like it! It seems so—so—very peculiar! such a queer whim, you know!”

“That is just what everybody says—such a queer whim! You get so
much talked about, you know,” subjoined Arethusa. “And it is so
excessively disagreeable to be talked about! I couldn’t stand it.”

“But you do not understand,” pursued Blanche, solemnly, “that you might
make a living by it. Why, we three expect to be a rich firm in the
course of time; to buy up bank stock and railway shares, and speculate
in real estate, and all that. Emma is a capital book-keeper. Papa says
she could command a salary of a thousand dollars a year already. Then,
think of the luxury of having a new dress, or, what is the same thing,
one that is made over to look like new, at every party; and as many
hats a season as you want, for what it would cost to buy one at Madame
Lavigne’s. And finally, you see, one respects herself so thoroughly and
deliciously for being able to fill up a real place—a worker’s place—in
the world. Most women remind me of marbles that have rolled somehow
into holes. Sometimes it is a fit. But as often as not the marble is
round, and the hole is square!”


PART II.

“ALL aboard!”

As the cars glided out of the lighted depot into the darker streets,
leading to the utter gloom of the open country, two gentlemen settled
themselves into their seats with audible sighs of satisfaction.

“Homeward bound!” said the elder, a man of fifty, hale in figure and
face, although his hair was almost white.

“For which let us be thankful!” responded his companion, heartily.
“This has been a long week to me, although a busy one—longer than a
fortnight would have been at home.”

“You may blame the twin babies for that,” said the other, smiling
indulgently at his impatience.

“Bless them for it, you mean—the boys and their mother. A man may
well be impatient to get back to such treasures as are mine.”

He was a fine-looking fellow, manly in every gesture and tone,
six-and-twenty years old, the son-in-law of the gentleman beside him,
and had been for a year his law-partner.

“You are right. Emma is a good girl—a noble woman; her mother’s own
daughter for sense, discretion, and warmth of heart. There is nothing
frivolous or shallow about her. Let me see—the boys are almost three
months old, are they not?”

“Just three months to-morrow. It is marvellous what strength the
thought of them puts into my heart and arm. The cunning little rascals!
Emma writes that they grow every day. She is sure they will recognize
me on my return. I suppose you experienced papas, who have outlived the
novelty of this sort of thing, amuse yourselves vastly at our expense;
but it pleases me to believe what she says. They are very bright,
healthy in mind and body, as the children of such a mother should be.
They and I are blest beyond comparison in having her for the angel in
our house. Should it please GOD to spare our lives”—

The sentence rested on the shocked air, incomplete, never to be
finished. One terrific jar!—a crashing and splintering, and reeling,
an awful sense of falling down, down, through utter darkness, over
and over, then a blow that ended everything—surprise, consternation,
fearful questioning—in blank, black silence.

When the débris of the telescoped cars was cleared away, the two men
were found lying, as they had sat, side by side. The younger was dead.
The elder moved and groaned as he was lifted from the wreck. Papers
upon their persons established their identity beyond a doubt.

Early next morning a telegram was brought into a pretty dressing-room,
where the sunshine, peering through the vine-leaves about the window,
made dancing shadows on the floor, laughed, and leaped, and flashed
in reflection from the water in a China bath, set in the middle of
the chamber. In this splashed and crowed two baby-boys, one held by
the mother, the other by the grandmother, and between these knelt two
younger women—all four in delighted worship of the tiny cherubs. There
was a breathless hush as the youngest of the party sprang up to seize
the envelope, and tore it open.

“Collision!” said the missive. “Frederick Corwin killed instantly.
Philip Hiller badly injured. Both will be sent on in next train.”

In this ghastly shape came disaster to the long-exempt household.
Life and the world had dealt so benignly and bountifully with them
heretofore, that they had insensibly learned to look upon their
possession of health, love, and happiness as assured for years and
years to come. Emma’s marriage had removed her from them but a couple
of blocks, and all concurred in the opinion that this was a charming
variety upon their former estate.

“How did we ever get along without Fred’s and Emma’s house to run
into? It is as good as having two homes,” the girls often said among
themselves.

When the twins came—bouncing, healthy boys—the excitement and joy in
one house equalled that in the other. It seemed now, indeed, that
they could ask nothing more of Heaven; that the brimming cup of bliss
was mantled all over with rose-leaves. And when “Papa and Fred” were
obliged to be absent from their homes for a week, in attendance upon
the doings of a court a hundred miles away, Emma and her babes were
transferred with much ceremony and rejoicing to her mother’s care;
given up to the petting and admiration of the doating aunties without
reservation, beyond Fred’s earnest entreaty that they would not kiss
the boys away to skeletons before he returned, and a threat to have
them protected by copper sheathing from the fate of St. Peter’s brazen
toe.

Dear Fred! the merry, handsome, stalwart brother; their only one,—who
was never to jest with them again; never again to hold wife and
babes in his embrace. Imogen and Blanche mourned for him only less
passionately than did she who had proudly and gladly borne his name.
Poor wife! she was denied the satisfaction of hearing that her name
had been the last in his thoughts and speech; that the loyal heart
had never beat more lovingly for her than in its latest throbbings;
for weeks passed before Mr. Hiller could speak at all, and then the
disjointed utterances of the palsied tongue told nothing beyond the
terrible fact that the brain had sustained serious, it might be
irreparable, damage. A paralytic cripple he would remain until the day
of his death, although this half-life might be prolonged for years,
pronounced the best medical authorities in the land, summoned without
regard to distance or expense, by the agonized wife.

Stricken, smitten of GOD, and afflicted, the four women sat them down
together in the mother’s room, a month after the double bereavement,
and took mournful but deliberate counsel together. Their affairs were
not at a desperate pass, as they already knew. There was the house in
which they lived, free of mortgage, which would bring at least thirty
thousand dollars in the market; ten thousand dollars in bank stocks and
other securities—solid, paying investments, and five thousand dollars’
worth of real estate—chiefly unimproved lots in a growing part of the
city, that might be very valuable in time, if they could be held and
the taxes paid. Fred had invested four thousand dollars in the latter
kind of property, and his life was insured for ten thousand more. If
Emma were to sell everything—furniture, lots and all—she would have
just seventeen thousand dollars with which to support herself, to rear
and educate her boys. By living upon the interest of the life-insurance
fund, and paying taxes on the real-estate for some years, she might
double the little fortune bequeathed to her, without reserve, by her
husband’s will.

“I shall not touch a cent of it, if I can help it,” she said, in sad
decision. “It shall be the father’s provision for his sons. They will
need it all, in order to educate themselves as he would have wished.
For the present I shall work for them and myself. You foresaw this
years ago, mother. I thank GOD, and thank you, that you prepared us to
meet it!”

“Amen!” said her sisters fervently. “Dark as is the day—so much darker
than we ever dreamed it would be,” added Imogen, tearfully, yet trying
to smile, “we have much to be thankful for. We are strong; we know how
to work; and there are papa and the babies, darling Fred’s sons, to
work for.”

“Papa and the babies!” Even the fond wife did not resent the
classification. The hale gentleman whose half-century of honest,
temperate life had not bowed his head or dimmed his eye; the sage,
shrewd man of business, than whom none were more respected by his
fellow-citizens, was a tremulous, timid child, who wept if his meals
were delayed one minute, or his wife, his faithful, tender nurse, were
out of his sight for an hour.

“Utterly incapable of attending to the simplest matters connected with
his business!” cried open-eyed Everybody, hovering, harpy-like, about
the human wreck. “Why, he couldn’t count one hundred to save his life.
Of course, they will get a certificate of lunacy from the court, and
sell the house, lots, and whatever they can realize anything upon; put
all they have together, and live as prudently as possible. The girls
ought to marry before long. They are pretty and popular, in spite of
their little eccentricities. It isn’t to be expected that they will
make brilliant matches now, of course; but they must bring down their
ambition to a reasonable level. Beggars mustn’t be choosers. It is
unfortunate that poor Mrs. Corwin has those two children. But they may
not live. Twins are more likely to die than other babies. And, if they
should be taken, she’ll be likely to pick up another husband. Her
little property would be a consideration to some men.”

Even the true friends of the sorely-tried family wished sincerely and
aloud that “each of the dear girls had a husband to take care of her;”
recommended them warmly to the compassionate and favorable notice of
their bachelor acquaintances, and devised pious plans of matchmaking
for their relief from the inconveniences of their altered circumstances.

“The worst part of it all was that poor Emma was encumbered with the
children, who would be more and more expensive every year, and that
poor, dear Mr. Hiller would be a helpless imbecile all his life. And
what a mistake in them to refuse to treat him as such, and have him
examined by a commission who would give his family the right to dispose
of his property!”

If the Ruler of the intellects and lives of men had hearkened to these
benevolent economists, the crippled man and the brace of “unfortunate”
infants would have been taken speedily and comfortably out of this
present evil world.

“Thank heaven for the babies!” uttered Blanche, throwing her arms about
Emma’s waist. “You darling sister! I bless you for them every hour.
What should we have done through all these last fearful weeks without
them—and you? Touch their weeny teenty patrimony! Indeed you shall not!
And more than that, we’ll make it a big one by the time they are ready
to enter college.”

The mother, as chief counsellor, had her plan ready for their
consideration. The house—a large double one—was still to be occupied
by them. The front parlor was to be used for the millinery department,
and put entirely under Blanche’s care. In the back, Imogen would hold
sway; and a smaller apartment in the rear of the hall should be the
fitting and trying-on chamber. The library across the hall, adjoining
the dining-room, was to be the family parlor. In every other part of
the house things were to remain unchanged.

“Who deserves to live more comfortably and luxuriously, to rest in soft
chairs and sleep upon elastic mattresses, to have generous food served
elegantly to tempt the appetite and strengthen the body, than she who
purchases all these with her own toil?” said the strange logician whose
daughters were too used to her “queer notions” to be startled by them.
“I do not say that you will make money fast, or at once. I do contend
that, saving rent, bookkeeper’s and saleswoman’s wages, as you will do,
you ought to be able to clear your business and personal expenses the
first year—if nothing more.”

“If the customers come,” suggested Emma.

Mrs. Hiller nodded confidently. “They will come! In the beginning, out
of curiosity and the love of novelty. It will depend upon your skill
whether they continue their custom.”

All previous sensations respecting the Hillers—their odd fancies and
daring talk and levelling theories; Emma’s marriage and the birth
of her twins; the tragical death of her husband and Mr. Hiller’s
deplorable condition—faded into the realms of forgottenness before
that excited by the appearance in all the leading papers, the following
month, of an advertisement to the effect that the “Misses Hiller would
open on Tuesday, the 15th instant, at their father’s residence on Lofty
Avenue, a first-class millinery and dressmaking establishment, and
pledged themselves to use their best efforts to give satisfaction to
their customers.”

The sudden intrusion of a bee-moth into a well-regulated, honey-lined
hive might create such commotion among the inhabitants thereof as
prevailed in the “best circles” of the city when the Incredible was,
at length, developed by means of printer’s ink and paper, into the
Certain. The Hiller philosophy had wrought its legitimate fruits, said
the wise ones. Such sympathy with the lower classes, and familiarity
with their modes of thought and personal history, amounting to
fanatical imitation of their language and habits and mercenary views of
life; such bold scoffing at the ethics and usages of SOCIETY (this in
capitals half an inch long, if you please, Mr. Printer!) could have but
one sequel, and that a catastrophe.

“Be it so!” enunciated resigned Everybody, in the calm of sinless
despair. “Since the Hiller girls prefer to sink to the level of mere
working women; to fly in the face of Providence that would, if they
were more reasonable and less sentimental, endow them with property
to the amount of at least fifty thousand dollars—sixty thousand, if
poor Mrs. Corwin’s be included, with the certain prospect of fifteen
thousand more at poor Mr. Hiller’s death—if they prefer, instead of
taking the goods thus offered them and living like ladies in the
sphere to which they were born, faithful to the principles that
control refined SOCIETY—to delve and plan and accumulate, let them be
recognized forthwith as laborers—nothing more, and nothing less! We,
the loyal leaguers of SOCIETY, true to the traditions of our class and
age, cannot more effectually and dignifiedly exclude them from our
sacred circle than by patronizing and paying them as dressmakers
and milliners. They have exquisite taste. That we, being candid even
where our enemies are concerned, will admit. They have also, tact and
energy, and association with US in the past has given them just ideas
of our style and needs. While we do not budge an inch from our belief
and precept that they should have starved genteelly; lived on bread
and tea, dyed and turned and otherwise rejuvenated their friends’
cast-off dresses; shivered over pinched-in grates in winter and
sponged upon obliging acquaintances in summer—sooner than thus degrade
themselves and betray their caste for the sake of pampering their
flesh with the delicacies of the markets, and their pride by indulging
in purple and fine linen, in damask and cut-glass, in Brussels and
satin—we”—concluded breathless Everybody, “accept the situation as they
have set it before us.”

“But it is suicidal!” actually sobbed the well-wishers of the
recalcitrant trio. “They will never marry well now!”

“Tuesday the 15th inst.” arrived—sharp but clear November weather,
and the desecrated Hiller mansion wore its most cheerful aspect. In
the back parlor the decks had been cleared for action, as Imogen
phrased it, by removing the piano, a large sofa, and an inlaid stand
or two. Imogen’s sewing machine and chair were by the side window.
Before the embayed recess at the end of the room was a long, rather
narrow table of singular construction, the plan being her own. The
top was covered with enamelled leather, with morocco pouches at each
corner, rather larger than the pockets of a billiard-table, and deep
drawers underneath. A tape-measure and a case of scissors lay upon
this. The pictures on the walls; the carpets; the rich hangings of the
windows; the lounging-chairs set invitingly about, the easel, with its
collection of fine engravings in one corner, a chiffonier loaded with
attractive articles of virtu, and a few fresh, attractive books—even
the stand of flowers in the bay-window were the same that had so often
challenged the admiration of Mrs. Hiller’s guests, as giving her
parlors “such an air of home-like elegance.”

In Blanche’s realm there had been more and material alterations. In
the niches on each side of the mantel were tall, shallow cases, with
sliding glass doors. These were made of black walnut, and bright
silver-plated knobs and pegs set in the back. Beneath the doors were
drawers with handles of the same metal. An attractive array of bonnets
and hats hung in one case; of caps, and headdresses and wreaths,
bouquets, sprays of flowers in the other, these last apparently
springing from a box filled with moss set in the bottom. Opposite the
mock conservatory was a show-case, being a walnut table handsomely
carved, with a glass box on top containing ribbons arranged with a
nice regard to harmony and contrasts of colors and shades. This also
had drawers beneath with silver knobs. At one of the front windows
stood Blanche’s chair and wicker-work stand. Hanging-baskets of living
flowers swung between the curtains; a mocking-bird’s cage in the arch
dividing the rooms.

Emma was walking slowly up and down the length of the two apartments,
ready to retire, at the approach of customers, to her desk in the
fitting-room. Her sisters had insisted upon her right to seclude
herself from general observation.

“We don’t mind being made a show of! In fact, we rather like it!” the
irrepressible Blanche was saying. “But they sha’n’t come to stare at,
and whisper about you, Queenie!”

Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks were red as the French poppies in the
glass case near by. Every crimp in her blonde hair seemed to stir in
the breeze of excitement that swept and swayed her merry spirit. She
flitted about from Imogen’s dominion to her own, altering, admiring,
exclaiming, like a restless humming-bird.

“I am sorry for you, too,” she ran on, “for I anticipate great fun
during the next few weeks. All the calls to-day that are not prompted
by curiosity, more or less ill-natured, will be of condolence. Don’t I
know how our dear friends will pull out eye-glass and handkerchief in
the same tug. ‘You poor, dear girls!’ Mrs. Smith will sniff. (No matter
what happens to you, whether you lose a front tooth, or your fortune,
