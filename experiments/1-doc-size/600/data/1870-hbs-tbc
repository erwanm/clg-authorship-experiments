People have made loud outcries lately, both in America and England,
about violating the repose of the dead. We should like to know what
they call this. Is this, then, what they mean by respecting the dead?

Let any man imagine a leading review coming out with language equally
brutal about his own mother, or any dear and revered friend.

Men of America, men of England, what do you think of this?

When Lady Byron was publicly branded with the names of the foulest
ancient and foulest modern assassins, and Lord Byron's mistress was
publicly taken by the hand, and encouraged to go on and prosper in her
slanders, by one of the oldest and most influential British reviews,
what was said and what was done in England?

That is a question we should be glad to have answered. Nothing was done
that ever reached us across the water.

And why was nothing done? Is this language of a kind to be passed over
in silence?

Was it no offence to the house of Wentworth to attack the pure
character of its late venerable head, and to brand her in her sacred
grave with the name of one of the vilest of criminals?

Might there not properly have been an indignant protest of family
solicitors against this insult to the person and character of the
Baroness Wentworth?

If virtue went for nothing, benevolence for nothing, a long life of
service to humanity for nothing, one would at least have thought, that,
in aristocratic countries, rank might have had its rights to decent
consideration, and its guardians to rebuke the violation of those
rights.

We Americans understand little of the advantages of rank; but we did
understand that it secured certain decorums to people, both while
living and when in their graves. From Lady Byron's whole history, in
life and in death, it would appear that we were mistaken.

What a life was hers! Was ever a woman more evidently desirous of
the delicate and secluded privileges of womanhood, of the sacredness
of individual privacy? Was ever a woman so rudely dragged forth,
and exposed to the hardened, vulgar, and unfeeling gaze of mere
curiosity?--her maiden secrets of love thrown open to be handled by
roués; the sanctities of her marriage-chamber desecrated by leering
satyrs; her parents and best friends traduced and slandered, till one
indignant public protest was extorted from her, as by the rack,--a
protest which seems yet to quiver in every word with the indignation of
outraged womanly delicacy!

Then followed coarse blame and coarser comment,--blame for speaking
at all, and blame for not speaking more. One manly voice, raised for
her in honourable protest, was silenced and overborne by the universal
roar of ridicule and reprobation; and henceforth what refuge? Only this
remained: 'Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the
keeping of their souls to him as to a faithful Creator.'

Lady Byron turned to this refuge in silence, and filled up her life
with a noble record of charities and humanities. So pure was she, so
childlike, so artless, so loving, that those who knew her best, feel,
to this day, that a memorial of her is like the relic of a saint. And
could not all this preserve her grave from insult? O England, England!

I speak in sorrow of heart to those who must have known, loved, and
revered Lady Byron, and ask them, Of what were you thinking when you
allowed a paper of so established literary rank as the 'Blackwood,' to
present and earnestly recommend to our New World such a compendium of
lies as the Guiccioli book?

Is the great English-speaking community, whose waves toss from Maine
to California, and whose literature is yet to come back in a thousand
voices to you, a thing to be so despised?

If, as the solicitors of the Wentworth family observe, you might be
entitled to treat with silent contempt the slanders of a mistress
against a wife, was it safe to treat with equal contempt the
indorsement and recommendation of those slanders by one of your oldest
and most powerful literary authorities?

No European magazine has ever had the weight and circulation in America
that the 'Blackwood' has held. In the days of my youth, when New
England was a comparatively secluded section of the earth, the wit
and genius of the 'Noctes Ambrosianæ' were in the mouths of men and
maidens, even in our most quiet mountain-towns. There, years ago, we
saw all Lady Byron's private affairs discussed, and felt the weight of
Christopher North's decisions against her. Shelton Mackenzie, in his
American edition, speaks of the American circulation of 'Blackwood'
being greater than that in England.[29] It was and is now reprinted
monthly; and, besides that, 'Littell's Magazine' reproduces all its
striking articles, and they come with the weight of long established
position. From the very fact that it has long been considered the Tory
organ, and the supporter of aristocratic orders, all its admissions
against the character of individuals in the privileged classes have a
double force.

[Footnote 29: In the history of 'Blackwood's Magazine,' prefaced to
the American edition of 1854, Mackenzie says of the 'Noctes' papers,
'Great as was their popularity in England it was peculiarly in
America that their high merit and undoubted originality received the
heartiest recognition and appreciation. Nor is this wonderful when it
is considered that for one reader of "Blackwood's Magazine" in the old
country there cannot be less than fifty in the new.']

When 'Blackwood,' therefore, boldly denounces a lady of high rank as a
modern Brinvilliers, and no sensation is produced, and no remonstrance
follows, what can people in the New World suppose, but that Lady
Byron's character was a point entirely given up; that her depravity was
so well established and so fully conceded, that nothing was to be said,
and that even the defenders of aristocracy were forced to admit it?

I have been blamed for speaking on this subject without consulting Lady
Byron's friends, trustees, and family. More than ten years had elapsed
since I had had any intercourse with England, and I knew none of them.
How was I to know that any of them were living? I was astonished to
learn, for the first time, by the solicitors' letters, that there were
trustees, who held in their hands all Lady Byron's carefully prepared
proofs and documents, by which this falsehood might immediately have
been refuted.

If they had spoken, they might have saved all this confusion. Even
if bound by restrictions for a certain period of time, they still
might have called on a Christian public to frown down such a cruel
and indecent attack on the character of a noble lady who had been a
benefactress to so many in England. They might have stated that the
means of wholly refuting the slanders of the 'Blackwood' were in their
hands, and only delayed in coming forth from regard to the feelings
of some in this generation. Then might they not have announced her
Life and Letters, that the public might have the same opportunity as
themselves for knowing and judging Lady Byron by her own writings?

Had this been done, I had been most happy to have remained silent. I
have been astonished that any one should have supposed this speaking
on my part to be anything less than it is,--the severest act of
self-sacrifice that one friend can perform for another, and the most
solemn and difficult tribute to justice that a human being can be
called upon to render.

I have been informed that the course I have taken would be contrary to
the wishes of my friend. I think otherwise. I know her strong sense
of justice, and her reverence for truth. Nothing ever moved her to
speak to the public but an attack upon the honour of the dead. In her
statement, she says of her parents, 'There is no other near relative to
vindicate their memory from insult: I am therefore compelled to break
the silence I had hoped always to have observed.'

If there was any near relative to vindicate Lady Byron's memory, I
had no evidence of the fact; and I considered the utter silence to
be strong evidence to the contrary. In all the storm of obloquy and
rebuke that has raged in consequence of my speaking, I have had two
unspeakable sources of joy; first, that they could not touch her;
and, second, that they could not blind the all-seeing God. It is worth
being in darkness to see the stars.

It has been said that I have drawn on Lady Byron's name greater
obloquy than ever before. I deny the charge. Nothing fouler has been
asserted of her than the charges in the 'Blackwood,' because nothing
fouler could be asserted. No satyr's hoof has ever crushed this pearl
deeper in the mire than the hoof of the 'Blackwood,' but none of them
have defiled it or trodden it so deep that God cannot find it in the
day 'when he maketh up his jewels.'

I have another word, as an American, to say about the contempt shown
to our great people in thus suffering the materials of history to be
falsified to subserve the temporary purposes of family feeling in
England.

Lord Byron belongs not properly either to the Byrons or the Wentworths.
He is not one of their family jewels to be locked up in their cases.
He belongs to the world for which he wrote, to which he appealed, and
before which he dragged his reluctant, delicate wife to a publicity
equal with his own: the world has, therefore, a right to judge him.

We Americans have been made accessories, after the fact, to every
insult and injury that Lord Byron and the literary men of his day have
heaped upon Lady Byron. We have been betrayed into injustice and a
complicity with villany. After Lady Byron had nobly lived down slanders
in England, and died full of years and honours, the 'Blackwood' takes
occasion to re-open the controversy by recommending a book full of
slanders to a rising generation who knew nothing of the past. What
was the consequence in America? My attention was first called to the
result, not by reading the 'Blackwood' article, but by finding in a
popular monthly magazine two long articles,--the one an enthusiastic
recommendation of the Guiccioli book, and the other a lamentation over
the burning of the Autobiography as a lost chapter in history.

Both articles represented Lady Byron as a cold, malignant, mean,
persecuting woman, who had been her husband's ruin. They were so full
of falsehoods and misstatements as to astonish me. Not long after, a
literary friend wrote to me, 'Will you, can you, reconcile it to
your conscience to sit still and allow that mistress so to slander that
wife,--you, perhaps, the only one knowing the real facts, and able to
set them forth?'

Upon this, I immediately began collecting and reading the various
articles and the book, and perceived that the public of this generation
were in a way of having false history created, uncontradicted, under
their own eyes.

I claim for my country, men and women, our right to true history.
For years, the popular literature has held up publicly before our eyes
the facts as to this man and this woman, and called on us to praise or
condemn. Let us have truth when we are called on to judge. It is our
right.

There is no conceivable obligation on a human being greater than
that of absolute justice. It is the deepest personal injury to an
honourable mind to be made, through misrepresentation, an accomplice
in injustice. When a noble name is accused, any person who possesses
truth which might clear it, and withholds that truth, is guilty of a
sin against human nature and the inalienable rights of justice. I claim
that I have not only a right, but an obligation, to bring in my solemn
testimony upon this subject.

For years and years, the silence-policy has been tried; and what has it
brought forth? As neither word nor deed could be proved against Lady
Byron, her silence has been spoken of as a monstrous, unnatural crime,
'a poisonous miasma,' in which she enveloped the name of her husband.

Very well; since silence is the crime, I thought I would tell the world
that Lady Byron had spoken.

Christopher North, years ago, when he condemned her for speaking, said
that she should speak further,--

'She should speak, or some one for her. One word would suffice.'

That one word has been spoken.




PART II.




CHAPTER I.

LADY BYRON AS I KNEW HER.


An editorial in 'The London Times' of Sept. 18 says:--

 'The perplexing feature in this "True Story" is, that it is impossible
 to distinguish what part in it is the editress's, and what Lady
 Byron's own. We are given the impression made on Mrs. Stowe's mind
 by Lady Byron's statements; but it would have been more satisfactory
 if the statement itself had been reproduced as bare as possible, and
 been left to make its own impression on the public.'

In reply to this, I will say, that in my article I gave a brief
synopsis of the subject-matter of Lady Byron's communications;
and I think it must be quite evident to the world that the main
fact on which the story turns was one which could not possibly be
misunderstood, and the remembrance of which no lapse of time could ever
weaken.

Lady Byron's communications were made to me in language clear, precise,
terrible; and many of her phrases and sentences I could repeat at this
day, word for word. But if I had reproduced them at first, as 'The
Times' suggests, word for word, the public horror and incredulity would
have been doubled. It was necessary that the brutality of the story
should, in some degree, be veiled and softened.

The publication, by Lord Lindsay, of Lady Anne Barnard's communication,
makes it now possible to tell fully, and in Lady Byron's own words,
certain incidents that yet remain untold. To me, who know the whole
history, the revelations in Lady Anne's account, and the story related
by Lady Byron, are like fragments of a dissected map: they fit
together, piece by piece, and form one connected whole.

In confirmation of the general facts of this interview, I have the
testimony of a sister who accompanied me on this visit, and to whom,
immediately after it, I recounted the story.

Her testimony on the subject is as follows:--

 'MY DEAR SISTER,--I have a perfect recollection of going
 with you to visit Lady Byron at the time spoken of in your published
 article. We arrived at her house in the morning; and, after lunch,
 Lady Byron and yourself spent the whole time till evening alone
 together.

 'After we retired to our apartment that night, you related to me
 the story given in your published account, though with many more
 particulars than you have yet thought fit to give to the public.

 'You stated to me that Lady Byron was strongly impressed with the idea
 that it might be her duty to publish a statement during her lifetime,
 and also the reasons which induced her to think so. You appeared at
 that time quite disposed to think that justice required this step, and
 asked my opinion. We passed most of the night in conversation on the
 subject,--a conversation often resumed, from time to time, during
 several weeks in which you were considering what opinion to give.

 'I was strongly of opinion that justice required the publication of
 the truth, but felt exceedingly averse to its being done by Lady Byron
 herself during her own lifetime, when she personally would be subject
 to the comments and misconceptions of motives which would certainly
 follow such a communication.

  'Your sister,

  'M. F. PERKINS.'

I am now about to complete the account of my conversation with Lady
Byron; but as the credibility of a history depends greatly on the
character of its narrator, and as especial pains have been taken
to destroy the belief in this story by representing it to be the
wanderings of a broken-down mind in a state of dotage and mental
hallucination, I shall preface the narrative with some account of
Lady Byron as she was during the time of our mutual acquaintance and
friendship.

This account may, perhaps, be deemed superfluous in England, where so
many knew her; but in America, where, from Maine to California, her
character has been discussed and traduced, it is of importance to give
interested thousands an opportunity of learning what kind of a woman
Lady Byron was.

Her character as given by Lord Byron in his Journal, after her first
refusal of him, is this:--

 'She is a very superior woman, and very little spoiled; which is
 strange in an heiress, a girl of twenty, a peeress that is to be in
 her own right, an only child, and a savante, who has always had her
 own way. She is a poetess, a mathematician, a metaphysician; yet,
 withal, very kind, generous, and gentle, with very little pretension.
 Any other head would be turned with half her acquisitions and a tenth
 of her advantages.'

Such was Lady Byron at twenty. I formed her acquaintance in the year
1853, during my first visit in England. I met her at a lunch-party in
the house of one of her friends.

The party had many notables; but, among them all, my attention was
fixed principally on Lady Byron. She was at this time sixty-one years
of age, but still had, to a remarkable degree, that personal attraction
which is commonly considered to belong only to youth and beauty.

Her form was slight, giving an impression of fragility; her motions
were both graceful and decided; her eyes bright, and full of interest
and quick observation. Her silvery-white hair seemed to lend a grace
to the transparent purity of her complexion, and her small hands
had a pearly whiteness. I recollect she wore a plain widow's cap of
a transparent material; and was dressed in some delicate shade of
lavender, which harmonised well with her complexion.

When I was introduced to her, I felt in a moment the words of her
husband:--

  'There was awe in the homage that she drew;
  Her spirit seemed as seated on a throne.'

Calm, self-poised, and thoughtful, she seemed to me rather to resemble
an interested spectator of the world's affairs, than an actor involved
in its trials; yet the sweetness of her smile, and a certain very
delicate sense of humour in her remarks, made the way of acquaintance
easy.

Her first remarks were a little playful; but in a few moments we were
speaking on what every one in those days was talking to me about,--the
slavery question in America.

It need not be remarked, that, when any one subject especially occupies
the public mind, those known to be interested in it are compelled to
listen to many weary platitudes. Lady Byron's remarks, however, caught
my ear and arrested my attention by their peculiar incisive quality,
their originality, and the evidence they gave that she was as well
informed on all our matters as the best American statesman could be.
I had no wearisome course to go over with her as to the difference
between the General Government and State Governments, nor explanations
of the United States Constitution; for she had the whole before her
mind with a perfect clearness. Her morality upon the slavery question,
too, impressed me as something far higher and deeper than the common
sentimentalism of the day. Many of her words surprised me greatly, and
gave me new material for thought.

I found I was in company with a commanding mind, and hastened to
gain instruction from her on another point where my interest had
been aroused. I had recently been much excited by Kingsley's novels,
'Alton Locke' and 'Yeast,' on the position of religious thought in
England. From these works I had gathered, that under the apparent
placid uniformity of the Established Church of England, and of 'good
society' as founded on it, there was moving a secret current of
speculative enquiry, doubt, and dissent; but I had met, as yet, with
no person among my various acquaintances in England who seemed either
aware of this fact, or able to guide my mind respecting it. The moment
I mentioned the subject to Lady Byron, I received an answer which
showed me that the whole ground was familiar to her, and that she was
capable of giving me full information. She had studied with careful
thoughtfulness all the social and religious tendencies of England
during her generation. One of her remarks has often since occurred to
me. Speaking of the Oxford movement, she said the time had come when
the English Church could no longer remain as it was. It must either
restore the past, or create a future. The Oxford movement attempted
the former; and of the future she was beginning to speak, when our
conversation was interrupted by the presentation of other parties.

Subsequently, in reply to a note from her on some benevolent business,
I alluded to that conversation, and expressed a wish that she would
finish giving me her views of the religious state of England. A portion
of the letter that she wrote me in reply I insert, as being very
characteristic in many respects:--

 'Various causes have been assigned for the decaying state of the
 English Church; which seems the more strange, because the clergy have
 improved, morally and intellectually, in the last twenty years. Then
 why should their influence be diminished? I think it is owing to the
 diffusion of a spirit of free enquiry.

 'Doubts have arisen in the minds of many who are unhappily bound by
 subscription not to doubt; and, in consequence, they are habitually
 pretending either to believe or to disbelieve. The state of Denmark
 cannot but be rotten, when to seem is the first object of the
 witnesses of truth.

 'They may lead better lives, and bring forward abler arguments; but
 their efforts are paralysed by that unsoundness. I see the High
 Churchman professing to believe in the existence of a church, when the
 most palpable facts must show him that no such church exists; the
 "Low" Churchman professing to believe in exceptional interpositions
 which his philosophy secretly questions; the "Broad" Churchman
 professing as absolute an attachment to the Established Church as the
 narrowest could feel, while he is preaching such principles as will at
 last pull it down.

 'I ask you, my friend, whether there would not be more faith, as
 well as earnestness, if all would speak out. There would be more
 unanimity too, because they would all agree in a certain basis. Would
 not a wider love supersede the creed-bound charity of sects?

 'I am aware that I have touched on a point of difference between
 us, and I will not regret it; for I think the differences of mind
 are analogous to those differences of nature, which, in the most
 comprehensive survey, are the very elements of harmony.

 'I am not at all prone to put forth my own opinions; but the tone in
 which you have written to me claims an unusual degree of openness
 on my part. I look upon creeds of all kinds as chains,--far worse
 chains than those you would break,--as the causes of much hypocrisy
 and infidelity. I hold it to be a sin to make a child say, "I
 believe." Lead it to utter that belief spontaneously. I also consider
 the institution of an exclusive priesthood, though having been of
 service in some respects, as retarding the progress of Christianity at
 present. I desire to see a lay ministry.

 'I will not give you more of my heterodoxy at present: perhaps I need
 your pardon, connected as you are with the Church, for having said so
 much.

 'There are causes of decay known to be at work in my frame, which lead
 me to believe I may not have time to grow wiser; and I must therefore
 leave it to others to correct the conclusions I have now formed from
 my life's experience. I should feel happy to discuss them personally
 with you; for it would be soul to soul. In that confidence I am
 yours most truly,

 'A. I. NOEL BYRON.'

It is not necessary to prove to the reader that this letter is not in
the style of a broken-down old woman subject to mental hallucinations.
It shows Lady Byron's habits of clear, searching analysis, her
thoughtfulness, and, above all, that peculiar reverence for truth and
sincerity which was a leading characteristic of her moral nature.[30]
It also shows her views of the probable shortness of her stay on earth,
derived from the opinion of physicians about her disease, which was a
gradual ossification of the lungs. It has been asserted that pulmonary
diseases, while they slowly and surely sap the physical life, often
appear to give added vigour to the play of the moral and intellectual
powers.

[Footnote 30: The reader is here referred to Lady Byron's other
letters, in Part III.; which also show the peculiarly active and
philosophical character of her mind, and the class of subjects on which
it habitually dwelt.]

I parted from Lady Byron, feeling richer in that I had found one more
pearl of great price on the shore of life.

Three years after this, I visited England to obtain a copyright for the
issue of my novel of 'Dred.'

The hope of once more seeing Lady Byron was one of the brightest
anticipations held out to me in this journey. I found London quite
deserted; but, hearing that Lady Byron was still in town, I sent to
her, saying in my note, that, in case she was not well enough to call,
I would visit her. Her reply I give:--

 'MY DEAR FRIEND,--I will be indebted to you for our
 meeting, as I am barely able to leave my room. It is not a time for
 small personalities, if they could ever exist with you; and, dressed
 or undressed, I shall hope to see you after two o'clock.

  'Yours very truly,
  'A. I. NOEL BYRON.'

I found Lady Byron in her sick-room,--that place which she made so
different from the chamber of ordinary invalids. Her sick-room seemed
only a telegraphic station whence her vivid mind was flashing out all
over the world.

By her bedside stood a table covered with books, pamphlets, and files
of letters, all arranged with exquisite order, and each expressing some
of her varied interests. From that sick-bed she still directed, with
systematic care, her various works of benevolence, and watched with
intelligent attention the course of science, literature, and religion;
and the versatility and activity of her mind, the flow of brilliant
and penetrating thought on all the topics of the day, gave to the
conversations of her retired room a peculiar charm. You forgot that
she was an invalid; for she rarely had a word of her own personalities,
and the charm of her conversation carried you invariably from herself
to the subjects of which she was thinking. All the new books, the
literature of the hour, were lighted up by her keen, searching, yet
always kindly criticism; and it was charming to get her fresh, genuine,
clear-cut modes of expression, so different from the world-worn phrases
of what is called good society. Her opinions were always perfectly
clear and positive, and given with the freedom of one who has long
stood in a position to judge the world and its ways from her own
standpoint. But it was not merely in general literature and science
that her heart lay; it was following always with eager interest the
progress of humanity over the whole world.

This was the period of the great battle for liberty in Kansas. The
English papers were daily filled with the thrilling particulars of that
desperate struggle, and Lady Byron entered with heart and soul into it.

Her first letter to me, at this time, is on this subject. It was while
'Dred' was going through the press.

 'CAMBRIDGE TERRACE, Aug. 15.

 'MY DEAR MRS. STOWE,--Messrs. Chambers liked the proposal to
 publish the Kansas Letters. The more the public know of these matters,
 the better prepared they will be for your book. The moment for its
 publication seems well chosen. There is always in England a floating
 fund of sympathy for what is above the everyday sordid cares of life;
 and these better feelings, so nobly invested for the last two years in
 Florence Nightingale's career, are just set free. To what will they
 next be attached? If you can lay hold of them, they may bring about
 a deeper abolition than any legislative one,--the abolition of the
 heart-heresy that man's worth comes, not from God, but from man.

 'I have been obliged to give up exertion again, but hope soon to be
 able to call and make the acquaintance of your daughters. In case you
 wish to consult H. Martineau's pamphlets, I send more copies. Do not
 think of answering: I have occupied too much of your time in reading.

  'Yours affectionately,

  'A. I. NOEL BYRON.'

As soon as a copy of 'Dred' was through the press, I sent it to
her, saying that I had been reproved by some excellent people for
representing too faithfully the profane language of some of the wicked
characters. To this she sent the following reply:--

 'Your book, dear Mrs. Stowe, is of the little leaven kind, and must
 prove a great moral force; perhaps not manifestly so much as secretly.
 And yet I can hardly conceive so much power without immediate and
 sensible effects: only there will be a strong disposition to resist
 on the part of all hollow-hearted professors of religion, whose
 heathenisms you so unsparingly expose. They have a class feeling like
 others.

 'To the young, and to those who do not reflect much on what is offered
 to their belief, you will do great good by showing how spiritual food
 is often adulterated. The bread from heaven is in the same case as
 bakers' bread.

 'If there is truth in what I heard Lord Byron say, that works of
 fiction live only by the amount of truth which they contain, your
 story is sure of a long life. Of the few critiques I have seen, the
 best is in "The Examiner." I find an obtuseness as to the spirit and
 aim of the book, as if you had designed to make the best novel of the
 season, or to keep up the reputation of one. You are reproached, as
 Walter Scott was, with too much scriptural quotation; not, that I
 have heard, with phrases of an opposite character.

 'The effects of such reading till a late hour one evening appeared to
 influence me very singularly in a dream. The most horrible spectres
 presented themselves, and I woke in an agony of fear; but a faith
 still stronger arose, and I became courageous from trust in God, and
 felt calm. Did you do this? It is very insignificant among the many
 things you certainly will do unknown to yourself. I know more than
 ever before how to value communion with you. I have sent Robertson's
 Sermons for you; and, with kind regards to your family, am

  'Yours affectionately,

  'A. I. NOEL BYRON.

I was struck in this note with the mention of Lord Byron, and, the next
time I saw her, alluded to it, and remarked upon the peculiar qualities
of his mind as shown in some of his more serious conversations with Dr.
Kennedy.

She seemed pleased to continue the subject, and went on to say many
