right adjustment is impossible where the very fact of their possession
involves a moral wrong. I see this so clearly, Doctor, that I shudder
inwardly at the bare imagination of committing such a wrong.”

“It is by trial that God proves us,” said I, “and may He bring you out
of this one, should the trial come, as gold from the refiner’s furnace!”

“Amen!” was her solemnly uttered response; “if it should come, may I be
found strong enough to do the right!”

For over a week this search for a will was continued, until it was
clear to all concerned that no such document was in existence. Then
preparation was made for the visit to England, in search of evidence
bearing upon the identity of Mrs. Montgomery as the sister of Captain
Allen. Two or three months elapsed, however, before Mr. Wallingford
could so arrange his business as to be absent for the length of time
it might take to complete his mission. He sailed for England in June,
between three and four months after the marriage of Delia Floyd. He
called to see me on the day before leaving, and I had a brief but
pleasant talk with him. He was in good health and good spirits, and
anticipated a successful visit.

“I shall gain,” he remarked, “in two ways by this trip. Professionally
and intellectually. I have had many a dream of that land of our
forefathers--England--now to be realized. I shall see London, walk its
streets, and linger amid its historic places. Don’t smile at this
almost boyish enthusiasm, Doctor. London has always been the Mecca of my
desires.”

I had never seen him so animated. A higher life seemed flowing in his
veins. His countenance had a brighter aspect than usual, and his head
an erecter carriage. There was a depth of meaning in his eyes never
observed before--a look as if some new born hope were lending its
inspiration to his soul. Altogether manlier was his aspect and bearing
than I had ever seen it.

“God speed your mission,” said I, as I shook hands with him in parting.

“If it depends on human agency, directed with earnestness, patience, and
will, my mission will have a prosperous result,” he replied. “It is to
be my first entirely self-reliant experience, and I think the discipline
of mind it will involve must strengthen me for higher professional work
than any in which I have yet been engaged. You are aware, Doctor, that
my heart is in my profession.”

“So I have seen from the beginning.”

“I will not deny,” he added, “that I have ambition. That I wish to be
distinguished at the bar.”

“An honorable ambition,” said I.

“Nor that, sometimes--in moments of weakness, perhaps--my dreams
have gone higher. But I am a very young man, and youth is ardent and
imaginative,” he added.

“And you have this great advantage,” I replied, “that, with every year
added to your life, you may, if you will, grow wiser and stronger. You
stand, as all young minds, at the bottom of a ladder. The height to
which you climb will depend upon your strength and endurance.”

“If we both live long enough, Doctor, you may see me on the topmost
rundle, for I shall climb with unwearying effort.”

He spoke with a fine enthusiasm, that lent a manly beauty to his face.

“Climb on,” I answered, “and you will rise high above the great mass,
who are aimless and indolent. But you will have competitors, few, but
vigorous and tireless. In the contest for position that you must wage
with these, all your powers will be taxed; and if you reach the
topmost rundle to which you aspire, success will be, indeed, a proud
achievement.”

“I have the will, the ambition, the courage, and the endurance, Doctor,”
 was his reply. “So, if I fail, the fault will lie here,” and he touched,
significantly, his forehead.

“For lack of brains?” said I, smiling.

“Yes. The defect will lie there,” he answered, smiling in return.

“Brains are remarkable for latent capacity. If stimulated, they develop
new powers, and this almost without limit. All they want is to be well
supplied with the right kind of food, and well worked at the same time.”

“I believe that, Doctor, and find vast encouragement in the thought,”
 and Wallingford laughed pleasantly.

Our parting words were growing voluminous. So we shook hands again,
repeated our mutual good wishes, and separated. In the afternoon he
started for Boston, from whence he sailed, on the next day, for England.

This was towards the latter end of June. He was to write to Mrs.
Montgomery immediately on his arrival out, and again as soon as he had
obtained an interview with the Willoughby family. Early in August,
she received his first letter, which was brief, simply announcing his
arrival at Liverpool.

About three weeks after the coming of this letter, I received a note
from Mrs. Montgomery asking me to call. On meeting her, I noticed
something in her manner that struck me as unusual. She did not smile, as
was her wont, when we met, her countenance retaining its usual serious
expression. I thought she looked paler, and just a little troubled.

“Thank you for calling so promptly, Doctor,” she said. “I am afraid you
will think me troublesome. But you have always shown a kindly interest
in me, though a stranger; and have proved, in all cases, a sound
adviser.”

I bowed, and she continued:

“I have a second letter from Mr. Wallingford. He has, he writes,
been well received by my relatives, who had placed in his hands,
for examination, a large quantity of papers that belonged to Colonel
Willoughby.”

“If they contain any evidence in the right direction, he will be sure to
find it,” said I.

“No doubt of that. But”--I thought her voice faltered a little--“the
question is solved, and he may return.”

“Solved! How?” I asked quickly.

“I have found the will.”

“What?”

“I have found the will,” she repeated, in a steady tone, “and that
solves the question.”

“Is it in your favor?” I asked, and then held my breath for a reply. It
came in a firmly uttered--

“No.”

We looked steadily into each other’s face for several moments.

“In whose favor?”

“In favor of Theresa Garcia his wife,” she replied.

“But she is dead,” I answered quickly.

“True--but I am not his heir.”

She said this resolutely.

“She died childless,” said I, “and will not the descent stop with
her?--the property reverting to you, as next of kin to Captain Allen?”

“She may have relatives--a brother or sister,” said Mrs. Montgomery.

“That is scarcely probable,” I objected.

“It is possible; and in order to ascertain the fact, all right means
ought to, and must be, taken.”

“Where did you find the will?” I inquired.

“Blanche was examining a small drawer in an old secretary, when she
accidentally pressed her hand against one side, which yielded. She
pressed harder, lad it continued to yield, until it was pushed back
several inches. On withdrawing this pressure, the side returned to its
place. She then tried to see how far it could be forced in. As soon
as it had passed a certain point, a secret drawer, set in vertically,
sprung up, and from the side, which fell open, the will dropped out.”

“It is singular,” said I, “that it should come to light just at this
time.”

“It is Providential, no doubt,” Mrs. Montgomery remarked.

“What course will you pursue?” I inquired.

“My first step will be to recall Mr. Wallingford.”

“I must take the liberty of a friend, and object to that,” said I.

“On what ground?”

“This will may be worth the paper on which it is written, and no more.
If the legatee have no relatives, you stand just where you stood before,
and will require the evidence as to identity for which Mr. Wallingford
is now in search. Oh, no, Mrs. Montgomery; he must not be recalled.”

The lady mused for a little while, and then said--

“Perhaps you are right, Doctor.”

“I am sure of it,” I replied, speaking earnestly. “This will, if we
find it, on examination, to be an instrument executed according to
legal forms, puts your rights in jeopardy, though by no means sets them
aside.”

“You take the correct view, no doubt,” was her reply to this. Her voice
was not so firm as in the beginning. As the probabilities began to show
themselves again in her favor, she lost a degree of self-possession.

“Let Mr. Wallingford complete his work,” said I, “and find, if possible,
the evidence you require, in case you prove to be the legal heir, as I
trust you will. And until his return, the existence of this important
document had better remain a secret.”

“Shall I not submit it to Judge Bigelow?”

I reflected for some moments, and then replied--

“Yes. He is your legal adviser, and one in whom the highest confidence
may be reposed. The will should be at once placed in his hands for
examination.”

“And go upon record?”

“Better leave all to his superior legal judgment. But,” as the thought
occurred to me, “who are named as the executors of this will?”

“I did not examine as to that, being too much interested in the
provisions of the writing,” she replied.

“May I see the document?”

“Blanche, dear, you will find it in the right-hand drawer of the
secretary, in our room;” and Mrs. Montgomery handed a key to her
daughter, who left the apartment in which we were sitting. She came back
in a few minutes, and handed me a paper, which, on examination, I found
to be written throughout, and evidently by the hand of Captain Allen. It
was dated San Juan de Porto Rico, January 10, 1820, and was witnessed by
two signatures--the names Spanish. The executors were Judge Bigelow and
Squire Floyd. There was an important sentence at the conclusion of the
will. It was in these words:--“In case my wife, in dying, should leave
no relatives, then every thing shall revert to my own right heirs,
should any be living.”

All this gave the affair, in my mind, a more serious aspect. Before
mentioning the executors’ names, I said--

“Do you know where Theresa Garcia resided, before her marriage with
Captain Allen?”

“In Porto Rico, as I have learned from old ‘Aunty,’ and also from
letters found in searching for the will.”

“Which I find was executed at San Juan De Porto Rico, the principal town
on the island. Judge Bigelow and Squire Floyd are the executors.”

I saw her start slightly, and grow a little pale as I said this.

“Judge Bigelow, and Squire Floyd! That is extraordinary!” She was more
disturbed than I had yet seen her in reference to this matter.

“It is remarkable, certainly, that Judge Bigelow, your legal adviser,
should be one of the executors of a will, which determines your
brother’s estate out of the line of consanguinity.”

“He must, of course, cease to represent my interest in the case,”
 remarked the lady.

“He cannot represent two diverse interests,” said I.

“No; that is clear.” She said this in a troubled way; and was,
evidently, falling into a perplexed state of mind. “Well, Doctor, what
is to be done?” She spoke with recovered self-possession, after a short
period of silence, looking at me with her old calmness of expression.

I took some moments for reflection, and then said,

“My advice is, to keep your own counsel, and wait until Mr. Wallingford
returns from England. Whenever you place this document in the hands of
Judge Bigelow, he must go over to the adverse interest; when you will
be compelled to seek another legal adviser. You are not just ready for
this; nor will be until after your agent comes back with the result of
his investigations. No wrong to any one can possibly occur from letting
things remain just as they are for a few months.”

“I think your view of the matter correct, Doctor,” was her reply. “And
yet, to keep this secret, even for an hour, when I have no right to its
possession, touches my conscience. Is it just? This will is not in my
favor. It does not even recognize my existence. It devises property,
of large value, in another line; and there may be heirs ready to take
possession, the moment its existence is made known to them. Am I not
intermeddling, unjustly, in the affairs of another?”

“But for you,” I replied, “this will might never have seen the light. If
heirs exist, they can, therefore, have no just reason for complaint at
the brief delay to which, under the circumstances, you are, in
common justice, entitled. Your conscience may be over sensitive, Mrs.
Montgomery.”

“I would rather it were over sensitive than obtuse,” she said. “Worldly
possessions are desirable. They give us many advantages. We all desire
and cling to them. But they are dearly bought at the price of heavenly
possessions. What will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
lose his own soul? Nothing! It were better for him to die like Lazarus.
No, Doctor, I am resolved in this matter to be simply just. If, in
justice and right, this estate comes into my hands, I will take the
wealth thankfully and use it as wisely as I can. But I will not throw
a single straw in the way of its passing to the legal heirs of my
brother’s wife, if any are in existence and can be found.”

“But you will keep this secret until Mr. Wallingford’s return?” I urged.

“I do not see that wrong to any one can follow such a delay,” she
answered. “Yes, I will keep the secret.”

“And I will keep it also, even from my good Constance,” said I, “until
your agent’s return. The matter lies sacred between us.”



CHAPTER XIV.



“Mrs. Dewey is at her father’s,” said my wife to me, one evening in
August, as we sat at the tea-table.

“Ah! have you seen her?” I was interested at once. Six months had
elapsed since Delia’s wedding, and this was her first visit home; though
her mother had been twice down to New York, in company with the Squire,
who had business with the firm to which Ralph belonged. In fact, since
his marriage to Squire Floyd’s daughter, young Dewey had prevailed upon
his father-in-law to make the house of Floyd, Lawson, Lee & Co., agents
for the entire product of his manufactory--an arrangement which the
Squire regarded as greatly to his advantage.

My question was answered in the affirmative.

“How is she?”

“Looking very well.”

There was no warmth or feeling in my wife’s voice or manner, although
Delia had been a favorite with her, and we had often talked about the
pleasure we should have in meeting her again.

“Have you nothing more to say of our young friend?” I asked.

“She is very much changed.”

“For the better?”

“Some might think so. I do not.” There was a disappointed manner about
my wife.

“In what respect is she changed?”

“Some would say that she had grown handsome; and, in truth, her
countenance strikes you, at first, as much improved. It is rounded to a
fuller outline, and has a style about it, caught, I suppose, from city
life and feeling. But she carries her head with a statelier air than is
becoming Squire Floyd’s daughter; and I am very sure, that, as the wife
of Ralph Dewey, she has acquired no special consequence. Rich jewelry
may be very well in city drawing-rooms, and public assemblages, where
dress is made conspicuous. But to sport diamond ear-rings and breastpin,
splendid enough for a countess, in her father’s little parlor, and
before the eyes of friends who loved her once for herself alone, savored
so strongly of weak pride and vanity, that I could not look upon her
with any of my old feelings. It was Delia Floyd no longer. Already,
the pure, sweet, artless maiden, had changed into a woman of the world,
dressed up for show. Ah, my husband! if this is the effect of city life,
let me never breathe its tainted atmosphere.”

And she dropped her eyes, with a sigh, and sat, lost in thought, for
several moments.

“Your account of Delia pains me,” said I. “Is the case indeed so bad?”

“It is. Alas! the fine gold is dimmed. Our sweet young friend has
strayed from the paths of nature, and will never, I fear, get back
again.”

“Had you any conversation with her?” I inquired.

“Yes: or, rather I listened to her, as she ran on about her city life;
the grand people with whom, she had already become acquainted; and the
splendor of balls, parties, soirees, and operas. I grew sober as she
talked: for not one true womanly sentiment fell from her lips. She did
not express interest in any of her new friends and acquaintances for
the good qualities they possessed; but spoke of their wealth, style of
living, social connections, and other attractions wholly external to the
individual. She was even eloquent over star actresses and opera singers;
one or two of whom she spoke of having met at the house of a fashionable
friend.”

“How true the old adage, that evil communications corrupt good manners!”
 said I.

“There must be some radical weakness in a case of such sudden
deterioration as this,” replied my wife. “Some latent vanity and love of
the world. I cannot believe that one sensible young woman in ten would
be spoiled to the degree that Delia is spoiled, if you passed her
through like temptations.”

I saw Delia myself, on the next day. She was dressed in New York, not in
S----, style; and so, naturally, appeared to disadvantage in my eyes.
I found her very bright and animated; and to my questions as to her
new city life, she spoke warmly of its attractions. At times, in the
intervals of exciting talk, her countenance would fall into its true
expression, as nearly all countenances will when thought ceases to be
active--that expression, in which you see, as in a mirror, the actual
state of mind. It revealed far more than came into her consciousness at
the time, else would she have covered it with one of the rippling smiles
she had already learned to throw, like a spangled veil, over her face.

Mrs. Dewey spent nearly a month in S----and then went back with her
husband to New York. I saw them several times together during this
period. He had grown more pompous in manner, and talked in a larger way.
Our little town was simply contemptible in his eyes, and he was at no
pains to conceal his opinion. New York was everything; and a New York
merchant of passable standing, able to put two or three towns like
S----in his breeches pocket.

The only interest I felt in this conceited young man was as the husband
of my young friend; and as touching their relation to each other, I
observed both of them very closely. It did not take me long to discover
that there was no true bond of love between them. The little fond
attentions that we look for in a husband of only six months’ standing;
and the tender reciprocations which are sure to follow, were all wanting
here. Constance spoke of this, and I answered, lightly, to cover the
regret the fact occasioned--

“It is not fashionable in good society, you know, for husband and wife
to show any interest in each other.”

She laid her hand suddenly upon my arm, and looked lovingly into my
face.

“May we never make a part of good society, then!”

I kissed her pure lips, and answered,

“There is no present prospect of it, my Constance. I am not ambitious of
social distinction. Still, our trial in this direction may come, for you
know that I am not without ambition professionally. A chair in one of
the medical schools might tempt me to an Atlantic city.”

Constance smiled, as she still rested her hand upon my arm. Then looking
from my face to our little ones, two of whom were playing on the floor,
while the third slept like a vision of innocence in the cradle, she
said:--

“I shall not need the glitter of diamonds--these are my jewels.”

Turn your eyes away, good society reader, lest they be offended at sight
of a husband’s kiss. Could I do less than breathe my tender love upon
her lips again?

“And richer jewels were never worn in the diadem of a queen,” said I.
“As a mother, woman attains her highest glory.”

“As wife and mother,” Constance answered quickly. And now she leaned
against me, and I drew my arm tenderly around her.

“And all this,” she said, “a good society woman must give up; and for
what? God help them in the time of life’s bitter trials and painful
experience, which all must endure in some degree!” She spoke with strong
feeling. “On what arm can a woman lean, who has no husband in the true
sense? Is she strong enough, standing alone, for life’s great battles?
What has she to sustain her, when all the external support, received
from pride, is swept away? Alas! Alas! Is there a blinder folly than the
pageantry of fashionable society? It is the stage on a grander scale,
glittering, gorgeous, fascinating to the senses--but all a mere
show, back from which the actors retire, each with an individual
consciousness, and the sad words pressing to tremulous lips--‘The heart
knoweth its own bitterness.’”

Like ourselves, most of Delia’s best friends were disappointed, and when
she returned to New York, no hearts followed her with tender interest,
except those of her own family. She had carried herself with an air
of too much self-consequence; or, if she came down to the level of
old friends and companions, it was with too evident a feeling of
condescension.

I happened to fall into the company of Squire Floyd and Judge Bigelow,
not very long after the return of Delia and her husband to New York.
The conversation turned upon business, and I learned that the Squire had
thought of enlarging his mill, and introducing steam--the water power
being only sufficient for its present productive capacity. Judge
Bigelow was very much interested, I found, in the particular branch of
manufacture in which his neighbor was engaged, and inclined to embark
some capital with him in the proposed extension of the works. They
frequently quoted the Judge’s nephew, Mr. Ralph Dewey, as to the extent
to which goods could be put into market by the house of Floyd, Lawson,
Lee & Co., who possessed, it was conceded, almost unlimited facilities.

I listened to their conversation, which involved plans of enlargement,
statistics of trade, home and foreign production, capital, and the
like, until I began to feel that I was moving in a narrow sphere, and
destined, in comparison with them, to occupy a very small space on the
world. And I will confess it, a shade of dissatisfaction crept over my
heart.

A few months later I learned that my two neighbors were jointly
interested in the mill, and that early in the ensuing spring steam-power
would be introduced, and the capacity of the works increased to more
than double their present range.

It was December when Wallingford returned from England. He brought
back with him all the evidence required to prove the identity of Mrs.
Montgomery. Up to this time only three persons knew of the existence of
a will--Mrs. Montgomery, Blanche, and myself; and we formed a council on
the question of what was now to be done. I gave it as my opinion, that,
as Judge Bigelow was one of the executors, and must in consequence cease
to act for Mrs. Montgomery, that we had better call in Mr. Wallingford,
and get his view of the case before placing the will in Judge Bigelow’s
hands. The mother and daughter agreed with me. So a time of meeting was
appointed, and a note sent to the young lawyer desiring his presence
at the house of Mrs. Montgomery. He seemed very much gratified at the
successful result of his visit to England, and referred to it with
something of pardonable pride in his manner.

“We have every reason,” said Mrs. Montgomery, in response to this, “to
be satisfied with the manner in which you have executed an important
mission. Since you left America, however, a document has come into my
hands, which, had it reached me earlier, would have saved you a long and
tedious search among mouldy and moth-eaten papers. It was nothing less
than Captain Allen’s will.”

And she gave him the paper. He looked surprised, and for a moment or two
bewildered. Then opening the will, he read it through rapidly. I saw the
color leave his face as he progressed, and his hand move nervously.
It was plain that his mind took in, at a grasp, the entire series of
consequences which the appearance of this document involved.

“This is a serious matter,” he said, looking up at Mrs. Montgomery.

“It is,” she answered, calmly. “The will appears to be in legal form.”

“Yes.”

“And must go into the hands of those who are named as executors.”

“And be by them entered in the office of probate,” added Wallingford.

“I would have placed it in their hands immediately on its discovery, but
have, acting under advice from my kind friend here, waited until your
return from England. No interest has suffered, I presume, by this
delay?”

“None.”

Wallingford bent his eyes to the floor, and sat for some time as if
half-confounded by the discovery.

“What step will the executors probably take?” I inquired.

“It will be their duty to assume possession of the estate, and hold it
for the heirs of Mrs. Allen, if any are in existence,” he replied.

“And it will be their duty to take all proper means for discovering
these heirs?” said I.

“Yes. That follows, of course.”

“And if none are found within a reasonable time?” I asked.

“The phrase, a reasonable time, is very indeterminate,” said
Wallingford. “It may include one, or ten years, according to the facts
in the case, the views of the executors and the courts.”

“But, finally?”

“Finally,” he answered, “if no heirs come forward to claim the estate,
it will revert to the old line of descent through the blood relations of
Captain Allen.”

“And come into the possession of Mrs. Montgomery?”

“Yes, if the courts are satisfied with the evidence which can be
presented in her favor.”

There followed a long silence, which Mrs. Montgomery was first to break.

“I believe,” she said, firmly, “that I am prepared for the final issue
of this matter, whatever it may be. I shall still require legal advice,
Mr. Wallingford.”

The young man bowed assent.

“And, as Judge Bigelow is one of the executors--”

“I do not think, madam,” said Wallingford, interrupting her, “that the
fact of his executorship will make him any the less a safe adviser for
you. He is a man of the highest integrity of character, clear-seeing,
and of impartial judgment.”

“I believe in his judgment and integrity,” she replied. “Still, I do not
think it well to have these two interests represented by the same man.
You are his associate, if I understand correctly the relation between
you.”

“I am, in a certain sense.”

“Do you have a share in all of his business?”

“Not in all.”

“So he can be independent of you in any special case if he deems it
desirable.”
