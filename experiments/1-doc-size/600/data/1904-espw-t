premacy of his. She was capable of a pro- 
found and passionate love ; she would yield 
to the torrent of his. She was in so far 
attracted to him that it rested with him- 
self — he now believed — to beleaguer her 
thoroughly, to overcome her absolutely. He 
perceived, indeed, that he had forced his op- 
portunity ; that he had spoken too soon. He 
passed the summer in a confident attempt to 
retrieve the mistake ; for this delay he was 
conscious of purposing that she should some- 
time atone to him. 

Their relation had now become an absorb- 
ing one. They had entered upon the ancient 
warfare for which history has never yet re- 
corded the protocols of peace — that between 
the loving and pursuing man and the at- 



 

tracted but reluctant woman. Steele seemed 
to himself to be steadily gaining upon her re- 
sistance. With hope in his heart and light in 
his eyes he went to her one August after- 
noon. 

He was intending to take the boat, as usual, 
but when he reached the wharf he found it 
crowded with a class of passengers who were 
not agreeable to him. He had no mind to join 
an excursion from the slums, and, suddenly 
changing his purpose, went out by train. 
When he left it at the seaside station he was 
pleased and surprised to see Miss Lauriat's 
black pair, with Matthew on the box ; in the 
carriage, however, there seemed to be other 
guests. Matthew did not stop at the station, 
and as the carriage whirled by, Steele had a 
good opportunity to see that it was filled, and 
filled to overflowing, with women and children 
of the social species that he had left behind 
him on the wharf in town. 

When he arrived at the house, tired and 
dusty from his walk, an unexpected pastel 
greeted him. Framed by the tall trees of the 
avenue where the vistas were cut out, a per- 
spective of sea met a foreground of lawn 



 

party. Rugs were spread, a tent, and tables. 
The shrill crackle of uneducated voices came 
to his ear before he had come near enough 
clearly to see Miss Lauriat's guests. These 
were twenty or thirty in number, and plainly 
they represented her tenants and proteges in 
Blind Alley. Ecstasy was in their voices, and 
adoration in their eyes. Old women were there, 
and children of assorted sizes. Cady's Molly 
was there in her red shirt waist and pink hair- 
ribbons, tastefully relieved by a yellow hat. 
Cady's Molly's father was there, and Dan 
Badger — in fact, the leading social circles 
of Blind Alley were represented. 

Miss Lauriat, in a plain white linen dress, 
moved merrily about among this pathetic 
group. Dr. Steele stood under the trees for a 
moment before he made his presence known. 
A consumptive woman, with a baby in her 
arms, and three little girls rolling over her, 
was sitting on the grass quite near him. At- 
tached to this family was a dingy white mon- 
grel of a melancholy disposition, who regarded 
Dr. Steele in cynical silence. But the woman 
looked up with the cheerful smile of her dis- 
order. 



 

" Nice ! " she said, " ain't it ? Say, did yer 
ever see anything like it, anywheres else ? " 

Dr. Steele's eyes sought Miss Lauriat's ex- 
alted face. " No," he said heartily, " no, I 
never did." 

"Say," repeated the woman, "d'you s'pose 
heaven's anything like this here?" 

"It is very possible," replied Steele fer- 
vently. 

" Because," said the woman, " if I thought 
it was " — 

" What would you do ? " asked Steele indif- 
ferently, " if you thought it were ? " 

The woman had caught the indefinable ac- 
cent of patronage in his tone, or perhaps she 
perceived that her grammar was corrected. 
(We remember that Patrick Henry talked to 
the backwoodsmen in their own dialect.) She 
glanced at Steele sharply, and did not finish 
her sentence. In fact, she took her children 
and moved away. 

Now Dr. Steele was more astonished than 
gratified to see Philip Surbridge, who had 
been teaching a little boy to ride a bicycle, 
catch up the three little girls and put them, 
with his ringing, boyish laugh, in three little 



 

swings which he personally conducted. Per- 
ceiving the doctor, he called out : 

" Ah, Steele ! We are having a beautiful 
time. You are just in season to enjoy your- 
self ! " 

Miriam turned to the doctor with a sweet 
shyness. 

" I never was so happy in my life ! " she 
said. " Most of these people haven't got into 
the country all summer ; some of them have 
never seen it. I cannot explain to you how it 
makes me feel. Everybody is here — every- 
body I asked ! " She spoke with the flattered 
gratification of a hostess whose salon is filled. 
" And Dan — and Dan, too," she added, " and 
Trixy ! " 

The crippled lad was lying in a hammock 
luxuriously reading a book on trained dogs. 
His crutch fell to the grass, and Miriam im- 
pulsively sprang and picked it up for him. 
Dan's eyes leaped to hers with the worship 
that deformity gives to beauty, and weakness 
to sympathetic strength. Dr. Steele watched 
this little episode with a puzzled expression. 

" I don't see Trixy." His gaze wandered 
about the lawn. "But then, I shouldn't know 



 

her if I did see her. Is that she ? " He pointed 
to the melancholy mongrel who was regarding 
the scene without enthusiasm. 

" I am ashamed of you ! " cried Miss Lau- 
riat, laughing, "not to recognize so famous 
an actress ! Trixy is in the coach house with 
Matthew. That poor, old, plebeian thing is not 
very clean, and Dan wouldn't let her asso- 
ciate with him. Trixy, you know, is an aristo- 
crat. The ice cream will be sent in to her on 
a cut-glass plate." 

"Is that gray dog one of the invited 
guests ? " 

" Why, of course. He came out on the 
steamer with the rest. He has a cough — 
that poor woman's dogs always do — and it 
was expected to do him good. He belongs to 
the little girls Mr. Surbridge is swinging. 
Come, Dr. Steele ! There are two boys who 
don't seem to be having a very good time. 
Would you mind playing Bear with them? 
Or perhaps Puss in the Corner. Or Wolf and 
Red Riding Hood ; or — something ! " 

"I can try," said Steele grimly. "But I 
am not sure how far I am to be flattered by 
your choice of roles." 



 

" You don't care for it," said Miriam under 
her breath. " You don't care for it at all. 
And it makes me so happy ! " 

" I care for anything that makes you happy ; 
you know I do." 

" Go, then," commanded Miriam, " and dis- 
cuss the tariff with Cady's Molly's father. It 
needs a man to entertain him. He has views 
about protection and free trade. The subject 
is beyond my depth, and I have never been 
able to keep up with it. It requires a mascu- 
line intellect." 

Steele laughed and obeyed her, awkwardly 
enough. His personal comfort was not en- 
hanced, nor the subject of the tariff advanced, 
by the reception which he met. 

" Oh, it 's you ! " said Cady's Molly's father. 
" You are the fellow that quarantined us, ain't 
you ? We fired you once. I never expected 
to see you again." 

Thus forced to feel his lack of position in 
slum society, conscious that he was unjustly 
made to suffer for a plain performance of 
duty, and therefore not in the best of hu- 
mors, Dr. Steele retreated from the lawn 
party and made his way to the piazza, where 



 

for an hour to come he solemnly discussed 
with Mrs. Jeffries the first arrest made by the 
Society for the Prevention of Docking and 
Cropping. The tail of a two weeks' puppy 
had been cut off, and the society had appealed 
to the humane sentiments of the state, and 
the majesty of the law. Dr. Steele did not 
return to the lawn party, which broke up 
directly after supper. 

In the little stir consequent on the de- 
parture of Miss Lauriat's guests, he stood 
embarrassed and apart. None of the people 
addressed him, and he was glad of it. Philip 
Surbridge went down the avenue with the 
consumptive woman on his arm ; in his other 
he carried the baby, and the three little girls 
clung to his coat-tails. 

" You 're coming back, aren't you ? " 
pleaded Mrs. Jeffries. " If you don't, there 
won't be anybody to talk to me." 

" I 'll come out to see you next week," an- 
swered Surbridge, with his tender smile. He 
did not meet Miriam's eye. " I will say good- 
night now. I think I 'll see them all safely 
back to town. They are a pretty helpless 
lot." 



 

This was in an undertone, but Miriam heard 
it, and warmly held out her hand. Dr. Steele 
watched her with compressed lips. She went 
part way down the avenue with Surbridge 
and the children. Dan Badger limped beside 
her with Trixy on his neck. The sea wind 
was shrewish, and Trixy wore her little over- 
coat with its hood. Miss Lauriat's poor people 
clung to her wistfully ; some of them kissed 
her, all blessed her, and then the turn in the 
avenue hid them. 

She came back walking rather fast, breath- 
less and beautiful. Steele went down to meet 
her. He had a paper in his hand ; it was a 
printer's proof-sheet. 

" It fell from your pocket," he began, " as 
you went down the steps. Will you pardon 
me? It was print, and I did look at it. I 
didn't read it, though. I didn't know that 
you wrote." 

Miriam flushed and held out her hand for 
the proof-sheet. 

" Let me read it, won't you ? " he entreated. 

" As long as you have seen it — well — 
yes. I do not know that I mind — that is — 
not very much." 



 

" I did not know that you were an au- 
thoress," observed Steele. 

" I am not an authoress/' flashed Miriam, 
"and no reading man ever uses that word, 
Dr. Steele. Let me have my proof-sheet, if 
you please." 

" Oh, forgive me ! " cried Steele. " I am 
always saying or doing the wrong thing." 

" And I am always forgiving you," she 
answered in an unsteady voice. 

Steele read the verses. There were but two, 
and they ran like this : 

SONG 

To the spaces between the stars 
We went, my love and I, 
Among the uttermost things. 
For my love hath wings; 
With twain he covers his face, 
With twain his feet, 
With twain he doth fly. 

To the earth and our rose-red door, 

We came, my love and I. 

Among the dear, daily things, 

He folded his wings. 

But the winged watch their time. 

And when he starts, 

Ah, how shall I fly ? 



 

He returned the proof-sheet to her. " I 
don't understand it," he said perplexedly. 
" It is graceful, but I don't think I know 
what you mean." 

Miriam put the verses back in her pocket. 

" Now your taste for painting," began Dr. 
Steele, " that appeals to me. I have never 
lost my interest in art. There are so many 
things that a man does lose, you know. I 
hope you have not given up whatever you 
were doing at the school? I like to think of 
you in that peaceful and aesthetic place." 

" I have not been there this summer," said 
Miriam, in a constrained tone. 

" Why not ? " 

Miriam made no reply. Her attraction for 
Dr. Steele had now reached a stage where she 
was conscious of wishing to harmonize with 
him in everything, and uncomfortable when 
she might not. She could not have explained 
to herself why it was that she often found it 
impossible to give him a confidence which she 
longed to offer. His presence brought her 
pleasure, but not peace. He came often ; the 
summer passed dreamily ; and she slowly be- 
gan to admit to herself — but not as yet to 



 

him — that he was becoming necessary to her. 
As the doctor's visits increased in frequency, 
those of the lawyer diminished. Miriam, who 
had been often beloved, had never counted 
Philip Surbridge among her suitors, and when 
she found that she missed him, felt quite at 
liberty to tell him so. 

Dear Philip [she wrote one day] : Aunt 
Cornelia is playing Mariana in the Moated 
Grange for your sweet sake. I mind it a little 
myself, that you stay away. 

Yours faithfully, 

Miriam Lauriat. 

Surbridge responded to this recall, but lei- 
surely, and it was the second week in Septem- 
ber before he came out to dme and spend the 
evening. Miriam was unaffectedly and heartily 
glad to see him. He took her out to row, for 
there was a rowing moon, and she sat in the 
stern, in her white boating dress, with her 
hands clasped behind her head, and looked at 
him affectionately. 

He rowed well, and she thought how square 
his shoulders were, and how sturdy his arm — 
for so studious a man. The values of his face 



 

in the strong, soft light were like those of a 
Reynolds portrait, which had the repose of an 
earlier, calmer age than ours. His very pre- 
sence quieted her ; it always had. Did he 
soothe most people in the same way? She 
sometimes asked herself the question. She 
was conscious of that old impulse to tell things 
to Philip Surbridge. It was not only that he 
belonged to one of the confessional profes- 
sions ; but he had the confessor's temperament. 

As he rowed her out from the shore she 
regarded him wistfully. There were no other 
boats about them, and they seemed to be quite 
alone with the sea and the sky. She thought 
of that other moon-bright night when she and 
Steele had stood upon the shore. But she and 
Surbridge were going straight out to sea. 

"It is the same sea, the same sky, the same 
moon," thought Miriam, " but it 's not the 
same woman." 

They talked little and lightly, with long 
silences between their quiet words. She felt 
a distinct relief from the mental turmoil of 
the summer. For this one hour it was not per- 
emptory to decide anything, and she was 
conscious of a sense of reprieve. 



 

Philip's boyish smile in itself was a comfort 
to her, as it always was, and his dark, mute 
eyes seemed to protect her from herself. He 
did not urge her confidence ; indeed, she was 
half aware that he fended it off. 

To Miriam, as to all high-minded girls, love 
had always seemed to be a demonstrable thing ; 
it never occurred to her that she could have 
any doubts about it when she should experience 
it, or that she could cast up the divine sum of 
her happiness in more than one inevitable way. 
Love was inexorable, in a sense mathematical ; 
it was of the celestial sciences ; it would be 
eternal, like the ordering of the stars, and she 
should follow its commands — brain and heart, 
soul and body, will and imagination — as the 
sea follows the moon. She was bewildered by 
the perturbation in which she had passed the 
last six months. If she had obeyed her mad- 
dest impulse, she would have cried out like a 
distressed girl to her elder brother : 

"Philip! Philip! What shall I do?" But 
in point of fact she said no such thing. 

"You are looking tired," Surbridge ob- 
served quietly ; but that was all. 

"I am tired," Miriam passionately exclaimed 



 

— as if he could help it ; as if she expected 
him to. 

She held out her hands to him girlishly. 

" If I thought I could really do anything " — 
began Surb ridge, laying down his oars. His 
manner had changed, and his tone, which at 
first was but gently troubled, rose into the 
ring of acute feeling. " But you must see 

— you cannot help understanding. It 's — 
hard ! " 

" Look out there ! " interrupted Miriam. 
" The steamer ! You are getting into her 
wake ! " 

Surbridge, veering sharply, skillfully escaped 
the serpent of foam which had begun to coil 
about their little rocking boat, as the steamer 
from the city passed them on her last trip 
out. Both looked up at the crowded deck. 
An undersized lad, who was leaning over the 
rail, seemed to be making an effort to attract 
their attention. 

" Why, there 's Dan Badger ! " cried Miriam 
quickly. " Look — look at his face. Row me 
ashore, please. Quick ! As fast as you can ! " 

Surbridge rowed rapidly and powerfully ; 
he beached the boat on a little cove below 



 

the wharf at which the steamer was somewhat 
slowly and clumsily making a landing. She 
was late, and would put about immediately 
on her return trip. Miriam jumped from the 
dory and ran up the bank without waiting 
for Surbridge. As soon as he could secure his 
boat he hurried after her. 

The crippled lad stood leaning on his crutch. 
He was trying to speak, but his words came 
thickly. His face was gray and pinched, like 
that of a little old man, and he shook from 
head to foot. Dan had neither eaten nor slept 
for twenty-four hours. 

" Where 's Trixy ? Where 's Trixy ? " Miriam 
was saying over and over. 

Dan stared at her stupidly as if he did not 
understand what she said. 

" Come, Dan," urged Surbridge very gen- 
tly, " tell us all about it." 

With a gesture never to be forgotten by 
those who witnessed it, the cripple dropped 
his crutch and threw both hands above his 
head, as one does in unendurable physical 
pain. 

" Trixy 's lost ! " 

" No ! No ! No ! " cried Miriam. 



 

" Not stolen ? " exclaimed Surbridge. 

But Dan repeated dully : " Trixy 's lost. I 
tell you Trixy 's lost. I 've hunted for her 
every wheres. Everybody 's hunted. Nobody 
can't find her." 

" Give me the circumstances," urged Sur- 
bridge, " if you can. Tell me when it hap- 
pened, and where. Try, Dan. Think how it 
was." 

" I can't," muttered Dan, " my — my head 
won't let me. It was last nig-ht — she had on 
her little coat you made her, Miss Laurie — 
it was sort of cold — and we 'd been playing 
at one of them beaches — I can't think the 
name — my head is bad. We was jest goin' 
home — you never see her play so pretty — 
I put her clown — I — think I put her down, 
and when I looked she wasn't there. I tried 
to hurry, but I 'm lame, you know. She wasn't 
there. — Sir?" 

For the first time since he had known her, 
Dan, disregarding his goddess, turned else- 
where for divine interference ; it was as if 
he felt that his extremity was a matter be- 
tween men. 

" Mr. Surbridge, sir," said Dan, " you told
