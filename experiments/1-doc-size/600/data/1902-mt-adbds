say to you. I loved you. That was 
before I asked your father to give 
you to me. His refusal is not my 
grievance — I could have endured that. 
But the things he said of me to you — 
that is a different matter. There — 
you needn't speak; I know quite 
well what they were; I got them 
from authentic sources. Among oth- 
er things he said that my character 
was written in my face; that I was 
treacherous, a jdissembler, a coward, 
badge.' Any other man in my place 
would have gone to his house and 
venge down like a dog. I wanted 
to do it, and was minded to do it, 
but a better thought came to me: 
to put him to shame; to break his 
heart; to kill him by inches. How 
to do it? Through my treatment of 
you, his idol! I would marry you; 
and then — Have patience. You 
will see.'' 
From that moment onward, for 
three months, the young wife suffered 
all the humiliations, all the insults, 
all the miseries that the diligent and 
inventive mind of the husband could 
contrive, save physical injuries only. 
Her strong pride stood by her, and 
she kept the secret of her troubles. 
Now and then the husband said, 
"Why don't you go to your father torres 
and tell him?" Then he invented 
new tortures, applied them, and asked 
again. She always answered, "He 
shall never know by my mouth,'' 
and taunted him with his origin; 
said she was the lawful slave of a 
scion of slaves, and must obey, and 
would — up to that point, but no 
further; he could kill her if he liked, 
but he could not break her ; it was not 
in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At 
the end of the three months he said, 
with a dark significance in his man- 
ner, " I have tried all things but one " 
—and waited for her reply. "Try 
that," she said, and curled her lip 
in mockery. 
That night he rose at midnight and 
fiend's P   clothes, then said to her, 
frenzy " Get up and dressi'' 
She obeyed — as always, without a 
word. He led her half a mile from 
the house, and proceeded to lash her 
to a tree by the side of the public road; 
and succeeded, she screaming and 
struggling. He gagged her then, 
struck her across the face with his 
cowhide, and set his blood -hounds 
on her. They tore the clothes off 
her, and she was naked. He called 
the dogs off, and said : 
" You will be found — by the passing 
public. They will be dropping along 
lyg about three hours from now, and will 
spread the news — do you hear? Good- 
appers . You have seen the last of me." 
He went away then. She moaned 
to herself: 
"I shall bear a child — to him! '' 
God grant it may be a boy!'' 
The farmers released her by-and- 
by — and spread the news, which was 
natural. They raised the country 
with lynching intentions, but the 
bird had flown. The young wife 
shut herself up in her father's house; 
he shut himself up with her, and 
thenceforth would see no one. His 
pride was broken, and his heart; so 
he wasted away, day by day, and 
even his daughter rejoiced when death 
relieved him. 
Then she sold the estate and dis- 
appeared. 
IN 1886 a young woman 
was living in a modest 
house near a secluded 
New England village, 
with no company but a little boy 
about five years old. She did her 
own work, she discouraged acquaint- 
anceships, and had none. The butch- 
er, the baker, and the others that 
served her could tell the villagers 
nothing about her further than that 
her name was Stillman, and that she 
called the child Archy. Whence she 
came they had not been able to find 
out, but they said she talked like a 
Southerner. The child had no play- 
mates and no comrade, and no teacher 
but the mother. She taught him dili- 
gently and intelligently, and was sat- 
isfied with the results — even a little 
proud of them. One day Archy said, 
" Mamma, am I different from other 
children?" 
"Well, I suppose not. Why?" 
''There was a child going along 
out there and asked me if the post- 
man had been by and I said yes, and 
she said how long since I saw him 
and I said I hadn't seen him at all, 
and she said how did I know he'd 
been by, then, and I said because I 
smelt his track on the sidewalk, and 
she said I was a dum fool and made 
, a mouth at me. What did she do 
scent 
of that for?" 
The young woman turned white, 
and said to herself, ''It's a birth- 
mark! The gift of the blood-hound 
is in him' She snatched the boy to 
her breast and hugged him passion- 
ately, saying, "God has appointed 
the way!'' Her eyes were burning 
with a fierce light and her breath 
came short and quick with excite- 
ment. She said to herself: "The 
puzzle is solved now; many a time 
it has been a mystery to me, the im- 
possible things the child has done in 
the dark, but it is all clear to me now." 
She set him in his small chair, and 
said. 
''Wait a little till I come, dear; 
then we will talk about the matter' 
She went up to her room and took 
from her dressing-table several small 
articles and put them out of sight : a 
nail-file on the floor under the bed ; a 
pair of nail-scissors under the bureau; a 
small ivory paper-knife under the ward- 
robe. Then she returned, and said : 
"There! I have left some things 
which I ought to have brought down' 
She named them, and said, " Run up 
and bring them, dear' 
The child hurried away on his er- 
rand and was soon back again with 
the things. 
" Did you have any difficulty, dear?" 
"No, mamma; I only went where 
you went." 
During his absence she had stepped 
to the bookcase, taken several books 
from the bottom shelf, opened each, 
passed her hand over a page, noting 
its number in her memory, then re- 
stored them to their places. Now 
she said : 
TheMsd "I have been doing something 
while you have been gone, Archy. 
Do you think you can find out what 
it was?'' 
The boy went to the bookcase and 
got out the books that had been touch- 
ed, and opened them at the pages 
which had been stroked. 
The mother took him in her lap, 
and said: 
"I will answer your question now, 
dear. I have found out that in one 
way you are quite different from other 
people. You can see in the dark, 
you can smell what other people can- 
not, you have the talents of a blood- 
hound. They are good and valuable 
things to have, but you must keep 
the matter a secret. If people found 
it out, they would speak of you as an 
odd child, a strange child, and chil- 
dren would be disagreeable to you, and 
give you nicknames. In this world \ 
one must be like everybody else if he i 
doesriT: want to provoke scorn or envy 
or jealousy. It is a great and fine 
distinction which has been born to you, 
and I am glad ; but you will keep it a 
secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?" 
The child promised, without under- 
standing. 
All the rest of the day the mother's 
brain was busy with excited think- 
ings; with plans, projects, schemes, 
each and all of them uncanny, grim, 
and dark. Yet they lit up her face; 
lit it with a fell light of their own; 
lit it with vague fires of hell. She 
was in a fever of unrest; she could 
not sit, stand, read, sew; there was 
no relief for her but in movement. 
She tested her boy's gift in twenty 
ways, and kept saying to herself all 
the time, with her mind in the past : 
"He broke my father's heart, and 
night and day all these years I have 
tried, and all in vain, to think out a 
way to break his. I have foimd it 
now — I have found it now." 
When night fell, the demon of unrest 
still possessed her. She went 
on with her tests; with a candle she 
traversed the house from garret to 
cellar, hiding pins, needles, thimbles, 
spools, under pillows, under carpets, 
in cracks in the walls, under the coal 
in the bin; then sent the little fellow.
Further in the dark to find them; which he 
did, and was happy and proud when 
she praised him and smothered him 
with caresses. 
From this time forward life took 
on a new complexion for her. She 
said, "The future is secure — I can 
wait, and enjoy the waiting." The 
most of her lost interests revived. 
She took up music again, and lan- 
guages, drawing, painting, and the 
other long-discarded delights of her 
maidenhood. She was happy once 
folf more, and felt again the zest of hfe. 
As the years drifted by she watched 
the development of her boy, and was 
contented with it. Not altogether, 
but nearly that. The soft side of 
his heart was larger than the other 
side of it. It was his only defect, in 
her eyes. But she considered that 
his love for her and worship of her 
made up for it. He was a good hater 
— that was well ; but it was a question 
if the materials of his hatreds were 
of as tough and enduring a quality 
as those of his friendships — and that 
was not so well. 
The years drifted on. Archy was 
become a handsome, shapely, athletic 
youth, courteous, dignified, com- 
panionable, pleasant in his ways, 
and looking perhaps a trifle older 
than he was, which was sixteen. 
One evening his mother said she had 
something of grave importance to 
say to him, adding that he was old 
enough to hear it now, and old enough 
and possessed of character enough 
and stability enough to carry out a 
stern plan which she had been for 
years contriving and maturing. Then 
she told him her bitter story, in all 
its naked_atrociousness. For a while 
the boy was paralyzed ; then he said : 
"I understand. We are Southerners;
and by our custom and nature 
there is but one atonement. I will 
search him out and kill him." 
" Kill him? No! Death is release, 
emancipation; death is a favor. Do 
I owe him favors? You must not 
hurt a hair of his head' 
The boy was lost in thought awhile; 
then he said: 
" You are all the world to me, and 
your desire is my law and my pleasure. 
Tell me what to do and I will do it.'' 
The mother's eyes beamed with 
satisfaction, and she said : 
"You will go and find him. I 
have known his hiding-place for eleven 
years; it cost me five years and more 
of inquiry, and much money, to locate 
it. He is a quartz-miner in Colorado, 
and well-to-do. He lives in Denver. 
His name is Jacob Fuller. There — it 
is the first time I have spoken it since 
that unforgettable night. Think 
That name could have been yours wander- 
if I had not saved you that shame ngje 
and furnished you a cleaner one. 
You will drive him from that place; 
you will hunt him down and drive 
him again ; and yet again, and again, 
and again, persistently, relentlessly, 
poisoning his life, filling it with mys- 
terious terrors, loading it with weari- 
ness and misery, making him wish 
for death, and that he had a suicide's 
courage; you will make of him an- 
other wandering Jew; he shall know 
no rest any more, no peace of mind, 
no placid sleep; you shall shadow 
him, cling to him, persecute him, till 
you break his heart, as he broke my 
father's and mine.'' 
"I will obey, mother." 
"I believe it, my child. The prep- 
arations are all made; everything is 
ready. Here is a letter of credit; 
spend freely, there is no lack of mon- 
ey. At times you may need disguises. 
I have provided them; also some oth- 
er conveniences' She took from the 
drawer of the type-writer table several 
squares of paper. They all bore these 
type-written words : 
$10,000 REWARD. 
It is believed that a certain 
man who is wanted in an East- 
ern State is sojourning here. 
In 1880, in the night, he tied 
his young wife to a tree by 
the public road, cut her across 
 
 
the face with a cowhide, and 
made his dogs tear her clothes 
from her, leaving her naked. 
He left her there, and fled 
the country. A blood-relative 
of hers has searched for him 
for seventeen years. Address 
 , Post-office. The 
above reward will be paid in 
cash to the person who will 
furnish the seeker, in a per- 
sonal interview, the crimi- 
nal's address. 
"When you have found him and 
acquainted yourself with his scent, 
you will go in the night and placard 
one of these upon the building he 
occupies, and another one upon the 
post-office or in some other prominent 
place. It will be the talk of the region. 
At first you must give him several 
days in which to force a sale of his 
belongings at something approach- 
Careful jjjg their value. We will ruin him 
cruely  
by-and-by, but gradually; we must 
not impoverish him at once, for that 
could bring him to despair and injure 
his health, possibly kill him.'' 
She took three or four more type- 
written forms from the drawer — du- 
plicates — and read one: 
, , 18.... 
To Jacob Puller: 
You have days in which 
to settle your affairs. You 
will not he disturbed during 
that limit, which will expire 
at M. , on the of 
You must then MOVE ON. 
If you are still in the place 
after the named hour, I will 
placard you on all the dead 
walls, detailing your crime 
once more, and adding the date, 
also the scene of it, with all 
names concerned, including 
your own. Have no fear of 
bodily injury — it will in no 
circumstances ever be in- 
flicted upon you. You brought 
misery upon an old man, and 
ruined his life and broke his 
heart. What he suffered, you 
are to suffer. 
"You will add no signature. He 
must receive this before he learns of 
the reward - placard — before he rises 
in the morning — lest he lose his head 
and fly the place penniless' 
"I shall not forget." 
"You will need to use these forms 
only in the beginning — once may 
be enough. Afterward, when you are 
ready for him to vanish out of a 
place, see that he gets a copy of this 
form, which merely says : 
MOVE ON. You have days 
"He will obey. That is sure." 
Extracts from Letters to the Mother, 
Denver, April 3, 1897. 
HAVE now been living 
several days in the same 
hotel with Jacob Fuller. 
I have his scent; I could 
track him through ten divisions of in- 
fantry and find him. I have often been 
near him and heard him talk. He owns 
a good mine, and has a fair income 
from it ; but he is not rich. He learned 
mining in a good way — by working 
at it for wages. He is a cheerful 
creature, and his forty -three years 
sit Hghtly upon him; he could pass 
for a younger man — say thirty -six 
or thirty-seven. He has never mar- 
ried again — passes himself off for a 
widower. He stands well, is liked, 
is popular, and has many friends. 
Even I feel a drawing toward him — 
the paternal blood in me making its 
claim. How blind and unreasoning 
and arbitrary are some of the laws 
of nature — the most of them, in fact! 
My task is become hard now — you 
realize it? you comprehend, and make 
allowances? — and the fire of it has 
oled, more than I like to confess to 
myself. But I will carry it out. Even 
with the pleasure paled, the duty re- 
mains, and I will not spare him. 
And for my help, a sharp resent- 
ment rises in me when I reflect that 
he who committed that odious crime 
is the only one who has not suffered 
by it. The lesson of it has mani- 
festly reformed his character, and in 
the change he is happy. He, the 
guilty party, is absolved from all suf- 
fering; you, the innocent, are borne 
down with it. But be comforted — he 
shall harvest his share. 
Silver Gulch, May 19. 
I placarded Form No. i at midnight 
of April 3; an hour later I slipped 
Form No. 2 under his chamber door, 
notifying him to leave Denver at or 
before 11.50 the night of the 14th. 
Some late bird of a reporter stole 
one of my placards, then hunted the 
town over and found the other one, 
and stole that. In this manner he 
accomplished what the profession call 
a " scoop " — that is, he got a valuable 
item, and saw to it that no other pa- 
per got it. And so his paper — the 
principal one in the town — had it in 
glaring type on the editorial page in 
the morning, followed by a Vesuvian 
opinion of our wretch a colunm long, 
which wound up by adding a thou- 
sand dollars to our reward on the 
paper s account! The journals out 
here know how to do the noble thing 
— when there's business in it. 
At breakfast I occupied my usual 
seat — selected because it afforded a 
view of papa Fuller's face, and was 
near enough for me to hear the talk 
that went on at his table. Seventy-  
five or a hundred people were in the  
  or 
room, and all discussing that item,  
and saying they hoped the seeker 
would find that rascal and remove 
the pollution of his presence from 
the town — with a rail, or a bullet, or 
something. 
When Fuller came in he had the 
Notice to Leave — folded up — in one 
hand, and the newspaper in the other ; 
and it gave me more than half a pang 
to see him. His cheerfulness was all 
gone, and he looked old and pinched 
and ashy. And then — only think of 
the things he had to listen to! Mam- 
ma, he heard his own unsuspecting 
friends describe him with epithets 
and characterizations drawn from the 
himself  dictionaries and phrase-books 
of Satan's own authorized editions 
down below. And more than that, 
he had to aee with the verdicts and 
applaud them. His applause tasted 
bitter in his mouth, though; he could 
not disguise that from me; and it was 
observable that his appetite was gone ; 
he only nibbled ; he couldn't eat. Fi- 
nally a man said : 
"It is quite likely that that rela- 
tive is in the room and hearing what 
this town thinks of that imspeak- 
able scoundrel. I hope so." 
Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way 
Fuller winced, and glanced around 
scared! He couldn't endure any 
more, and got up and left. 
During several days he gave out 
that he had bought a mine in Mexico, 
and wanted to sell out and go down 
there as soon as he could, and give 
the property his personal attention. 
He played his cards well; said he 
would take $40,000 — a quarter in 
cash, the rest in safe notes; but that 
as he greatly needed money on ac- 
count of his new purchase, he would 
diminish his terms for cash in full. 
He sold out for $30,000. And then, 
what do you think he did? He asked 
for greenbacks, and took them, say- 
ing the man in Mexico was a New- 
Englander, with a head full of crotch- 
ets, and preferred greenbacks to gold 
or drafts. People thought it queer, 
since a draft on New York could produce
greenbacks quite conveniently. 
There was talk of this odd thing, but 
only for a day ; that is as long as any 
topic lasts in Denver. 
I was watching, all the time. As 
soon as the sale was completed and 
the money paid — which was on the 
SHdking nth — I began to stick to Fuller's 
track without dropping it for a mo- 
ment. That night — no, 12th, for it 
was a little past midnight — I tracked 
him to his room, which was four doors 
from mine in the same hall, then I 
went back and put on my muddy 
day-laborer disguise, darkened my 
complexion, and sat down in my room 
in the gloom, with a gripsack handy, 
with a change in it, and my door ajar. 
For I suspected that the bird would 
take wing now. In half an hour an 
old woman passed by, carrying a grip; 
I caught tHe~Iainiliar whiff and fol- 
lowed, with my grip, for it was Fuller. 
He left the hotel by a side entrance, 
and at the corner he turned up an 
unfrequented street and walked three 
blocks in a light rain and a heavy 
darkness, and got into a two-horse 
hack, which, of course, was waiting 
for him by appointment. I took a 
seat (uninvited) on the trunk plat- 
form behind, and we drove briskly 
off. We drove ten miles, and the hack 
stopped at a way station and was 
discharged. Fuller got out and took 
a seat on a barrow under the awning, 
as far as he could get from the light; 
I went inside, and watched the ticket- 
office. Fuller bought no ticket; I 
bought none. Presently the train 
came along, and he boarded a car; 
I entered the same car at the other 
end, and came down the aisle and 
took the seat behind him. When 
he paid the conductor and named 
his objective point, I dropped back 
several seats, while the conductor 
was changing a bill, and when he 
came to me I paid to the same place 
— about a hundred miles westward. 
From that time for a week on end 
he led me a dance. He travelled here 
and there and yonder — always on a 
general westward trend — but he was 
not a woman after the first day. He 
was a laborer, like myself, and wore 
bushy false whiskers. His outfit was 
perfect, and he could do the character 
without thinking about it, for he had 
served the trade for wages. His near- 
est friend could not have recognized 
him. At last he located himself here, 
the obscurest little mountain camp 
in Montana; he has a shanty, and Lming 
goes out prospecting daily; is gone Xn% 
all day, and avoids society. I am 
living at a miner's boarding-house, 
and it is an awful place: the bunks, 
the food, the dirt — everything.. 
We have been here four weeks, 
and in that time I have seen him but 
once; but every night I go over his 
track and post myself. As soon as 
he engaged a shanty here I went to a 
town fifty miles away and telegraphed
