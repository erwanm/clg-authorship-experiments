to the rescue save me, Archy; save me!'' 

Stillman worked his way to the 
front, and said : 

"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be 
afraid." Then he said to the house, 
" Never mind how he got the hurt ; it 
hasn't anything to do with this case, 
and isn't of any consequence' 

"God bless you, Archy, for a true 
friend!" 

"HuiTah for Archyl Go in, boy, 
and play 'em a knock-down flush to 
their two pair 'n' a jack!" shouted 
the house, pride in their home talent 
and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty 
to it rising suddenly in the public 
heart and changing the whole atti- 
tude of the situation. 

Young Stillman waited for the noise 
to cease ; then he said, 

"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand 
by that door yonder, and Constable 
Harris to stand by the other one here, 
and not let anybody leave the room." 

" Said and done. Go on, old man!" 

"The criminal is present, I believe. 
I will show him to you before long, 
in case I am right in my guess. Now 
I will tell you all about the tragedy, 
from start to finish. The motive 
wasn't robbery ; it was revenge. The 
murderer wasn't light - witted. He 
didn't stand 622 feet away. He didn't 
get hit with a piece of wood. He didn't 
place the explosive against the cabin. 
He didn't bring a shot-bag with him, 
and he wasn't left-handed. With the 
exception of these errors, the distin- 
guished guest's statement of the case 
is substantially correct.'' 

A comfortable laugh rippled over 
the house; friend nodded to friend, as 
much as to say, ''That's the word, 
with the bark on it. Good lad, good 
boy. He ain't lowering his flag 
any!" 

The guest's serenity was not disturbed. 
Stillman resumed: 

" I also have some witnesses ; and I 
will presently tell you where you can 
find some more.'' He held up a piece 
of coarse wire; the crowd craned their 
necks to see. " It has a smooth coating 
of melted tallow on it. And here 
is a candle which is burned half-way 
down. The remaining half of it has 
marks cut upon it an inch apart. 

Soon I will tell you where I found 
these things. I will now put aside 
reasonings, guesses, the impressive 
hitching of odds and ends of clews 
together, and the other showy theatricals 
of the detective trade, and tell you 
in a plain, straightforward way just 
 how this dismal thing happened' 

' He paused a moment, for effect — to 

happened allow silence and suspense 
to intensify and concentrate the house's interest; 
then he went on : 

"The assassin studied out his plan 
with a good deal of pains. It was a 
good plan, very ingenious, and showed 
an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. 
It was a plan which was well calcu- 
lated to ward off all suspicion from its 
inventor. In the first place, he marked 
a candle into spaces an inch apart, 
and lit it and timed it. He found it 
took three hours to burn four inches 
of it. I tried it myself for half an hour, 
awhile ago, upstairs here, while the 
inquiry into Flint Buckner's character 
and ways was being conducted in 
this room, and I arrived in that way 
at the rate of a candle's consumption 
when sheltered from the wind. Hav- 
ing proved his trial-candle's rate, he 
blew it out — I have already shown it 
to you — and put his inch-marks on a 
fresh one. 

"He put the fresh one into a tin 
candlestick. Then at the five-hour 
mark he bored a hole through the 
candle with a red-hot wire. I have 
already shown you the wire, with a 
smooth coat of tallow on it — tal- 
low that had been melted and had 
cooled. 

"With labor — very hard labor, I 
should say — he struggled up through 
the stiff chaparral that clothes the 
steep hill-side back of Flint Buckner's 
place, tugging an empty flour-barrel 
with him. He placed it in that ab- 
solutely secure hiding-place, and in 
the bottom of it he set the candlestick. 
Then he measured off about thirty- 
five feet of fuse — the barrel's distance 
from the back of the cabin. He bored 

Lavfria barrel — here 
the mine he large gimlet he did it with. He 

went on and finished his work; and 
when it was done, one end of the fuse 
was in Buckner's cabin, and the other 
end, with a notch chipped in it to ex- 
pose the powder, was in the hole in 
the candle — timed to blow the place 
up at one o'clock this morning, pro- 
vided the candle was lit about eight 
o'clock yesterday evening — which I 

am betting it was — and provided there 
was an explosive in the cabin and 
connected with that end of the fuse — ddaits 

which I am also betting there was, 
though I can't prove it. Boys, the 
barrel is there in the chaparral, the 
candle's remains are in it in the tin 
stick ; the burnt-out fuse is in the gim- 
let-hole, the other end is down the hill 
where the late cabin stood. I saw 
them all an hour or two ago, when 
the Professor here was measuring off 
unimplicated vacancies and collecting 
relic5.ihat hadn't anything to do with 
the case,!' v 

He paused. The house drew a 
long, deep breath, shook its strained 
cords and muscles free and burst 
into cheers. 


"Dang him'' said Ham Sandwich, 
"that's why he was snooping around 
in the chaparral, instead of picking 
up points out of the P'fessor's game. 
Looky here — he ain't no fool, boys' 
"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" 
But Stillman was resuming: 
" While we were out yonder an hour 
or two ago, the owner of the gimlet 
and the trial-candle took them from a 
place where he had concealed them — 
it was not a good place — and carried 
them to what he probably thought 
was a better one, two hundred yards 
up in the pine woods, and hid them 
there, covering them over with pine 
needles. It was there that I found 
them. The gimlet exactly fits the 
hole in the barrel. And now — " 

The Extraordinary Man interrupted 
him. He said, sarcasticall} : 

"We have had a very pretty fairy- f 
tale, gentlemen — very pretty indeed.  

Now I would like to ask this young 
man aquSlibrr orirwrT'*' 

Some of the boys winced, and Fer- 
guson said, 

" Tm afraid Archy's going to catch 
it now' 

The others lost their smiles and 
sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: 

"Let us proceed to examine into 
this fairy-tale in a consecutive and 
orderly way — by geometrical pro- 
gression, so to speak — linking detail 
to detail in a steadily advancing and 
remorselessly consistent and unassail- 
able march upon this tinsel toy-fortress 
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow 
imagination. To begin with, young 
sir, I desire to ask you but three ques- 
tions at present — at present. Did I 
understand you to say it was your 

The opinion that the supposititious candle 
test was lighted at about eight o'clock 

yesterdaj'' evening?'' 
"Yes, sir — about eight." 
"Could you say exactly eight?" 
"Well, no, I couldn't be that ex- 
act." 

" Um. If a person had been passing 
along there just about that time, he 
would have been almost sure to en- 
counter that assassin, do you think?" 
"Yes, I should think so." 
"Thank you, that is all. For the 
present. I say, all for the present." 


" Dern himl he's laying for Archy," 
said Ferguson. 

"It's so' said Ham Sandwich. 
"I don't like the look of it." 

Stillman said, glancing at the guest, 

''I was along there myself at half 

 On the past eight — no, about nine." spot 

"In-deed? This is interesting — this 
is very interesting. Perhaps you en- 
countered the assassin yourself?" 

"No, I encoimtered no one." 

"Ah. Then — if you will excuse 
the remark — I do not quite see the 
relevancy of the information." 

"It has none. At present. I say 
it has none — at present." He paused. 
Presently he resumed: "I did not en- 
counter the assassin, but I am on his 
track, I am sure, for I believe he is in 
this room. I will ask you all to pass 
one by one in front of me — here, where 
there is a good light — so that I can 
see your feet' 

A buzz of excitement swept the 
place, and the march began, the guest 
looking on with an iron attempt at 
gravity which was not an unqualified 
success. Stillman stooped, shaded 
his eyes with his hand, and gazed 
down intently at each pair of feet as 
it passed. Fifty men tramped monot- 
onously by — with no result. Sixty. 
Seventy. The thing was beginning 
to look absurd. The guest remarked, 
with suave irony, 

"Assassins appeal to be scar ce 
this evening." 

The house saw the humor of it, and 


refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. 
Ten or twelve more candidates tramped 
by — no, danced by, with airy and 
ridiculous capers which convulsed the 
spectators — then suddenl} Stillman 
put out his hand and said, 

" This is the assassin !" 
" Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhe- 
drim!'' roared the crowd; and at once 
let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and 
dazzle and confusion of stirring re- 
marks inspired by the situation. 

At the height of the turmoil the 
guest stretched out his hand, com- 
manding peace. The authority of a 
great name and a great personality 
laid its mysterious compulsion upon 
the house, and it obeyed. Out of the 
panting calm which succeeded, the 
guest spoke, saying, with dignity 
and feeling: 

"This is serious. It strikes at an 
innocent life. Innocent beyond sus- 
picion! Innocent beyond perad vent- 
ure! Hear me prove it; observe how 
simple a fact can brush out of existence 
this witless lie. Listen. My friends, 
that lad was never out of my sight 
yesterday~evenTng at any time \" 

It made a deep impression. Men 
turned their eyes upon Stillman with 
grave inquiry in them. His face 
brightened, and he said, 

"I knew there was another one!" 
He stepped briskly to the table and 
glanced at the guest's feet, then up at 
his face, and said: "You were with 
him! You were not fifty steps from 

him when he lit the candle that by- 
and-by fired the powder .' (Sensor 
tion.) "And what is more, you furnished 
the matches yourself!'' matches 

plainly the guest seemed hit; it 
looked so to the public. He opened 
his mouth to speak; the words did 
not come freely. 

'' This — er — this is insanity — 
this—" 

Stillman pressed his evident ad- 
vantage home. He held up a charred 
match. 

''Here is one of them. I found it 
in the barrel — and there's another one 
there." 

The guest foimd his voice at once. 

"Yes — and put them there your- 
self." 


It was recognized as a good shot 
Stillman retorted: 

''It is wax — a breed unknown to 
this camp. I am ready to be searched 
for the box. Are you?" 

The guest was staggered this time 
— the dullest eye could see it. He 
fumbled with his hands ; once or twice 
his lips moved, but the words did not 
come. The house waited and watched, 
in tense suspense, the stillness adding 
effect to the situation. Presently Still- 
man said, gently, 

"We are waiting for your decision." 

There was silence again during 
several moments; then the guest an- 
swered, in a low voice, 

" I refuse to be searched." 

There was no noisy demonstration
but all about the house one voice 
after another muttered: 
"That settles it He's Archy's Arch's 
meat." 

What to do now? Nobody seemed 
to know. It was an embarrassing 
situation for the moment — merely, of 
course, because matters had taken 
such a sudden and unexpected turn 
that these unpractised minds were 
not prepared for it, and had come to a 
standstill, like a stopped clock, under 
the shock. But after a little the ma- 
chinery began to work again, tenta- 
tively, and by twos and threes the 
men put their heads together and 
privately buzzed over this and that 
and the other proposition. One of 
these propositions met with much fa- 
ingthe '» it was, to conf er upon the assassin 
assassin   q£ thanks for removing Flint 
Buclmer, and let him go. Butthe 
cooler heads opposed it, pointing out 
that addled brains in tHeEastern 
States would pronounce it a scandal, 
and make no end of foolish noise 
about it. In the end the cool heads 
got the upper hand, and obtained 
general consent to a proposition of 
their own, and their leader then called 
the house to order and stated it — to 
this effect: that Fetlock Jones be 
jailed and put upon his trial. 

The motion was carried. Appar- 
ently there was nothing further to do 
now, and the people were glad, for, 
privately, they were impatient to get 
out and rush to the scene of the trag- 
edy, and see whether that barrel and 
the other things were really there or 
not. 

But no— the break-up got a check. 
The surprises were not over yet. For 
a while Fetlock Jones had been silent- 
ly sobbing, unnoticed in the absorb- 
ing excitements which had been fol- 
lowing one another so persistently 
for some time; but when his arrest 
and trial were decreed, he broke out 
despairingly, and said : 

"No! it's no use. I don't want 
any jail, I don't want any trial; I've 
had all the hard luck I want, and all 
the miseries. Hang me now, and let 
me out! It would all come out, any- 
way — there couldn't anjhing save 
me. He bas told it all, just as if he'd 
been with me and seen it — I don't

know how he found out; and you 
find the barrel and things, and then I 
The wouldn't have any chance any more. 

sl' I killed him; and you'd have done 
it too, if he'd treated you like a dog, 
and you only a boy, and weak and 
poor, and not a friend to help you." 

"And served him damned well 
right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. 
"Looky here, boys—" 

From the constable: "Order! Or- 
der, gentlemen!" 

A voice: "Did your uncle know 
what you was up to?" 

"No, he didn't." 

"Did he give you the matches, 
sure enough?" 



"Yes, he did; but he didn't know 
what I wanted them for' 

" When you was out on such a busi- 
ness as that, how did you venture to 
risk having him along — and him a 
detective? How's that?" 

The boy hesitated, fumbled with 
his buttons in an embarrassed way, 
then said, shyly. 


"I know about detectives, on account 
of having them in the family; 
and if you don't want them to find 
out about a thing, it's best to have 
them around when you do it." 

The cyclone of laughter which 
greeted this naive discharge of wis- 
dom did not modify the poor little 
waif's embarrassment in any large 
degree. 




From a Letter to Mrs. Stillman, Dated 
merely "Tuesday." 

ETLOCK JONES was 
put under lock and key 
in an unoccupied log 
cabin, and left there to 
await his trial. Constable Harris 
provided him with a couple of days' 
rations, instructed him to keep a 
good guard over himself, and prom- 
ised to look in on him as soon as 
further supplies should be due. 
Next morning a score of us went 

with Hillyer, out of friendship, and 
helped him bury his late relative, the 
unlaniented Buckner, and I acted as 
first assistant pall-bearer, Hillyer act- 
ing as chief. Just as we had finished 
our labors a ragged and melancholy 
stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, 
limped by with his head down, and I 
caught the scent I had chased around 
the globe. It was the odor of Para- 
dise to my perishing hopel 

In a moment I was at his side and 
had laid a gentle hand upon his shoul- 
der. He slumped to the ground as 
if a stroke of lightning had withered 
him in his tracks; and as the boys 
came running he struggled to his 
knees and put up his pleading hands 
to me, and out of his chattering jaws 
he begged me to persecute him no 
more, and said, 

"You have hunted me around the 
world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is 
my witness I have never done any 
man harm!" 

A glance at his wild eyes showed 

' us that he was insane. That was 
msane 

my work, mother! The tidings of 
your death can some day repeat the 
misery I felt in that moment, but noth- 
ing else can ever do it. The boys 
Hfted him up, and gathered about 
him, and were full of pity of him, and 
said the gentlest and touchingest 
things to him, and said cheer up and 
don't be troubled, he was among 
friends now, and they would take 
care of him, and protect him, and hang 
and man that laid a hand on him. 
They are just Uke so many mothers, 
the rough mining -camp boys are, 
when you wake up the south side of 
their hearts; yes, and just like so 
many reckless and unreasoning chil- 
dren when you wake up the opposite 
side of that muscle. They did every- 
thing they could think of to comfort 
him, but nothing succeeded imtil Wells- 
Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strat- 
egist, said, 

"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's 
troubling you, you needn't worry any 
more." 

"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, 
eagerly. 

"Because he's dead again." 

"Deadl Dead ! Oh, don't trifle 

with a poor wreck like me. Is he 
dead? On honor, now — is he telling 
me true, boys?'' 

"True as you're a-standing therel" 
said Ham Sandwich, and they all 
backed up the statement in a body. 

"They himg him in San Bernar- 
fff dino last week," added Ferguson, 

by mistake clinching the matter,
"whilst he was 

searching around after you. Mis- 
took him for another man. They're 
sorry, but they can't help it now." 

"They're a-building him a monu- 
ment," said Ham Sandwich, with the 
air of a person who had contributed
