man who was neither mercenary nor poor. I hate econ- 
omy. I hate the humdrum domestic virtues. Neither of 
your sisters are compelled to practise them, and so far as 
I can see, they are respected. And you could make a 
fortune. Other men do. There are ways and occa- 
sions." 

"Well, why did you marry me?" he asks, in a tone 
deep and husky with suppressed passion. 

" Because I supposed you the coming man " ; and she 
laughs insolently. " You were a kind of hero, unjustly 
deprived of his own, and my girlish romance was aroused. 
How could I tell that the fates would continue their 



 



 



 

ankindness ? that the heroic Tirtaes would go unrewarded ? 
Aod I suppose vou, more sensible than I, toc^ me for 
the connection. It should, of coarse, have helped yon to 
a speedy fortune. We are like the Lammles in Dickens's 
story, equally disappointed.'' 

Basil Wentworth coold strike her where she stands. 
For a moment a whirlwind of anger rends his sool. Then 
he commands himself, but his face is deadly pale. 

" We will have no recriminations," he forces himself to 
say, quietly. " I am sorry if I have disappointed you. 
And I must confess the strife for wealth does not appear 
tLS attractive to me as it did at first. I am w«uy, sick of 
it all. But you shall have all in my power ttmt will con- 
duce to your happiness." 

'' Devotion can go no furtiier," she answered. '' Still, I 
could wish there were more in your power.'' 

He does not reply to her flippancy. He has heard of 
marital infelicities like this ; he has kaown in a business 
way of divorce cases whose first stnr« fcas arisen in sheer 
incompatibility. He is not afraid of any such ending, 
for after all she is Judge MintvJL'n daughter, and has 
been trained to respect the projrferfes. For her to com- 
mit any overt act would be slieur impossibility ; but he 
recognizes the fact that there rxver can be any real, true 
happiness between them ; tbi.t fJieir tastes and desires are 
not even harmonious. Th2ri he thinks of his sisters; 
they are fashionable wcmcOr always in society. That 
Louise is happy he cannot yuestion. She and her sur- 
roundings are exquisitely ii'ilapted and harmonize to the 
finest degree. Perhaps fbfii is what Frances would have 
liked. But Louise 13 #?doringly fond of her child, and 
considers her husbaai perfection. Would Frances, if 
her husband could ror/Ound her with as much luxury? 
He sighs to himseK. Are women always thinking of 
material comforts? li there some one whose life has 
been like a poem tbu one finds in the comer of an out-of- 



 



 



 

the-way country newspaper, and yet once read can never 
quite vanish from one's mind or the soul's sight ? 

Basil Wentworth takes up life with a manful humility 
the next morning. He has made this part of it himself, 
and he will do his best to mend instead of marring it any 
further. He is courteous to his wife and affable to his 
brother. He goes to his business, promising himself an 
early return. The journey that looked so tempting must 
be given up. It is hardly likely that Doris and Mrs. Gil- 
bert would care to spend a fortnight anywhere for the 
sake of an ailing child, even if — and he is not sure that 
it would be best to ask them. 

When he returns, he finds an empty house. Rose has 
taken the baby, who is much better, around to the Elms. 
Frances and Graham started at two, and will not be back 
before seven. Basil wanders forlornly from room to 
room, picks up a book and lays it down again, drums a 
little on the open piano, and then saunters out with no 
specially definite purpose, feeling as if he was wasting 
precious time ; but presently he finds himself at the Elms, 
and goes slowly up the winding avenue, his heart heavy 
with memories. 

They are all on the veranda. The baby is in Doris's 
lap, and is actually smiling. Lloyd is swinging in the 
hammock, and Rose is repeating a nursery medley. Mrs. 
Gilbert has some bright embroidery in her hands, and 
altogether it is a pretty picture. He puts it beside that 
of Doris singing to her landlady at the little inn. 

She colors, and her eyes droop exquisitely. It seems 
so strange to have Ids child in her arms, though it was 
natural enough a moment before. There is a little con- 
straint all around ; he feels it perceptibly. 

But they do settle to a degree of cordiality. He will 
not walk in, but prefers sitting on the step, — one of his 
old places. After a little he persuades Lloyd to come to 
him, and talks business with Doris in the intervals of 



 



 



 

amusement. How clear and well-disciplined Doris's mind 
seems ! Yet it certainly is 7iot unfeminine or narrow. He 
bethiuks himself of Mr. Stirling's admiration of her that 
he has sometimes listened to with a sneer, — heaven for- 
give him ! How harsh and maleficent he has been in bis 
judgments! Can anything ever make amends? It is 
like his marriage : even if the wrong is forgiven, the 
consequences reach out like the roots of some deadly 
plant and blight more than one life. His fate is hopeless. 
Let him accept it with what courage he may, and do his 
best in the future ; but, ah ! he recognizes the hard fact 
that the works of the past throw limitations around the 
deeds of the future. 

He goes back to his solitary dinner. It is eight when 
the truants return. Frances hurries through with her 
meal, attires herself elegantly, and a dozen or so guests 
come in. There is music, card-playing, a dainty supper, 
but Basil is bored. He is not the person for this light, 
trivial entertainment. 

Mrs. Basil is somewhat amused when she hears of his early 
return. Can it be that he is cultivating a spirit of rather 
watchful jealousy? Surely, if one cannot be familiar with 
one's own brother, — for, after all, Graham is that, — what 
privilege will there be left to life ? His, Basil's, devotion 
has always been rather formal and cumbersome, and she 
likes light, airy, superficial people, who are not going to 
the depths of theories and principles and high efforts for 
improvement. The world is well enough for her as it is. 
And if he does try to circumscribe her enjoyments, there 
will come open war. She will carry matters with a high 
hand, and he has such a horror of any diflSculty between 
man and wife. 



 



 



, CHAPTER XXV. 

A SUMMER MADNESS. 

Basil Wentworth confines himself as resolutely as be- 
fore to business. Indeed, Judge Minturn is rather ailing, 
and he relieves him of all that is possible, like the true 
and devoted son he has proved. Nothing pleases the 
elder man more than to see him softening toward his 
cousin's widow, making friends with the bright, attractive 
boy, and planning for his future. 

" This is quite as it should be," he says, one day. 

Basil's face is a flood of crimson. Then he suddenly 
stretches out his hand and takes that of his friend. 

"Let me at least make some reparation to you," he 
cries, in a tone of deep distress and humility. "I have 
been brutal, full of acerbity and uncharitableness. I shut 
my eyes resolutely and would not see or hear. I did not 
want to be convinced of the slightest error of judgment, 
but I have been, against my will. Your forgiveness and 
that of the dead I dare ask ; hers I never can. That 
will be my punishment for my haste and hatred. All 
that I can do for her or the child in the future will be 
done earnestly, faithfully." 

"My dear, dear Basil !" Then there is a long silence, 
for both men are deeply moved. "I have prayed that 
you might see your duty here, that you might overcome 
the one great blemish on your otherwise pm-e manhood. 
It is hardly likely that I shall live to see Lloyd's boy grown 
up, but I am satisfied that you will give him a father's 
care. God bless you in this work ! " he adds, tremulously. 

Basil feels the better for having made this confession. 



 



 



 

He is laying aside some of his bitterness ; he has learned 
that— 

'' Scruples too rigid are a cloak for pride," 

and he means to exorcise this demon. He looks upon 
duty in a new light. She is no longer a severe, implac- 
able, unswerving spirit, but wisdom and tenderness are 
in her soul as well ; are indeed her divine and beneficent 
attributes. 

He is gentler even to Frances. He evinces an interest 
in her pleasures, though he cannot approve, and suggests 
others in their stead, to which she listens with inward scorn. 

''Were you in earnest," she says, one of the rare 
evenings when the guests go early, — she is quite sure his 
presence has dispersed them, — "when you said to Mrs. 
Westbrook that we were not likely to live in Washington 
this winter? You mentioned it one night when you were 
angry—" 

"For the anger I desire to apologize," he replies, with 
the utmost courtesy. " Yes. I shall not remain steadily 
myself. I can always return home the last of the week, 
and from present indications I shall need some of my 
time and interest here. Your father is breaking sadly, 
I find." 

"Suppose 7 insist upon spending the winter there?" 
she demands, haughtily. 

"But you will not, when I tell you that our last year's 
dissipation made too great an inroad in our income. You 
might spend a month when it grows dull here." 

"Dull!" she echoes, scornfully. "Why, the winters 
here are like being exiled to Siberia. I never have been 
in the habit of staying here ; at least, not until I was 
married. You had better shut me in a dungeon at once." 

"This is childish," he answers, with the severe dignity 
that is so much a part of him. " We will not discuss the 
subject further" ; and rising, he leaves the room. 



 



 



 

She clinches her hands in a passion of anger. What is 
the meaning of this change coming over him? Does he 
intend to assert his power and become master of her? 
Hardly. Her eyes flash out a dangerous light. Why, she 
asks no more than other women. Who, of all the society 
people she knows, devotes her whole time to husband and 
babies ? Ages ago it might have been the grand climax 
of devotion, but it is not so to-day. There is a wider 
sphere ; there is a power in attractiveness that sways the 
world, and she likes the power, the triumph. 

To make poverty the excuse is simply silly. They can 
shut up their house, send Rose and the baby to her father's. 
No, there must be some deeper, hidden cause. Is he 
envious of her charm to society? Has he the mean, 
grudging desire to keep a woman hidden from all eyes 
but his own, and he, like a grand bashaw, to come 
and smile on his slave as he will? Oh! how could she 
have been so blind as to marry him? She looks back 
at herself with an incredulous wonder, a supreme con- 
tempt. 

Graham's relations to Doris and his sister-in-law puzzle 
himself immeasurably. He still keeps on friendly terms 
with Doris, aided and abetted not a little by Mrs. Gilbert, 
who has a great interest in the handsome young fellow, 
and cannot understand why Doris will not love him. But 
then she always was peculiar, unlike society girls. Left 
to herself, she would never have given Lloyd Wentworth 
sufficient encouragement to marry her. But Graham does 
not need that. His half -melancholy and sentimental ten- 
dernesses render him extremely fascinating to the elder 
woman, but day by day he grows more in disfavor with 
Doris. She is not jealous, but it does seem as if his rela- 
tions with Frances lowered his moral tone. She dislikes 
his flings at Basil, his dainty epicurean philosophies, his 
placing pleasure as the chief good. Surely there was a 
time when his manhood had a nobler promise. 



 



 



 

As for Graham, he rather enjoys dallying on the brink 
of a mild danger. The imperious moods of Frances and 
her evident dissatisfactions amuse him as an evening at a 
theatre. It is playing at love and sympathy to comfort 
lier, and at times she rises to heights that really do fasci- 
nate him. She is so spirited, so amhitious, she would 
carry along a husband of the same tastes and desires with 
herself. She seems born to be the wife of a stirring poli- 
tician, she is so fertile in plans and expedients, and Basil 
is really no politician, has none of the traits of leadership 
demanded at the present day. 

But since danger grows rapidly under prospering cir- 
cumstances, and the time flies, the week of departure 
draws nearer, trifling between them comes to be a more 
dangerous pastime. They allow themselves to discuss 
what life would have been were he in Basil's place. With 
that connection, there are easy ways of making a fortune 
that tlie world does not hold in actual disesteem, very little 
concerns itself with the methods, in fact, if the fortune is 
there. And Graham would be delighted to see her shine 
in society ; they could go forever dancing down the golden 
tide, quaffing the sparkling cup. Oh ! why has one spasm 
of ill-fated admiration destroyed her whole life? She 
could hate Basil Wentworth for coming in her way at that 
crisis. Then she considered it an honor to be the woman 
who could win his regard ; she enjoyed the triumph, but it 
has left a bitter flavor. 

Agatha gives a farewell entertainment to her brother, 
and Stirling House is at its best this August evening. All 
the family are together, and in a week they will be quite 
dispersed. Mr. and Mrs. Lenox are to start for the Pacific 
coast, the Stirlings talk of a journey abroad and a winter 
in Florence, the elder Mrs. Wentworth is to spend the 
winter in Cuba and the Bermudas with an invalid sister. 
So the two houses will be closed. After a month or so, 
Westwater will be dreary with wisdom, theology, and works 



 



 



 

of mercy, none of which have any attraction for Mrs. 
Basil. 

The dinner, the daintiest of repasts for a summer even- 
ing, a poem in its flowers, fruits, ices, and confections, its 
toasts and kindly wishes for the hero of the occasion, has 
ended. There is still some dancing, but many of the 
elder people have gone. The carriage has come for Doris, 
and she is to take Mr. and Mrs. Trevenna. Her quick 
glance fails to discern them ; they did stroll down the path 
five minutes agone. She can easily find them; indeed, 
there is a rare plant they have gone to examine for the 
second time. 

Doris glides swiftly through the parterre of sweets, of 
palms, and trailing vines so disposed as to give a much 
greater apparent area. They are not there ; does she 
hear a sound of voices, with a cadence that calls a smile 
to her half -parted lips? Olive and Trevenna are lovers 
yet, but it is hardly their wont to indulge in such pastime 
openly. She will laugh at them a little. 

Parting the vines that half en wreathe a pretty miniature 
pagoda, her eyes, now accustomed to the dusk, see two 
people clearly. They stand facing ; the woman's hands 
are clasped about the man's neck, her face is upturned, 
her lips are sweet with passionate sighs and kisses. It is 
Graham and his brother's wife. 

" What shall I do when you are gone?" she says, and 
there seem sobs in her voice. 

Doris turns and retraces her steps like a frightened 
fawn. White and breathless, she drops on a rustic seat 
close by the veranda. A servant is passing, and she asks 
him to find Mr. and Mrs. Trevenna. When she can sum- 
mon her breath and strength, she enters the hall. 

"How pale you are!" Mr. Stirling exclaims, with 
solicitude, giving her a startled look. 

' ' Am I ? It must be the cool air. I have been trying 
to find Olive," she says, rather excitedly. 



 



 



 

" Trevenna is in the library." And before he has finished 
she passes on. The warm room restores her color, and 
her presence of mind returns. 

They say their farewells. Basil is discussing something 
with a group of men, but he pauses to come and shake 
hands with her and Olive. Her fingers are icy cold as they 
touch his palm, for she feels almost like a traitor. 

They all chat pleasantly on the homeward way, and 
Olive makes some engagement for the morning. Not 
until Doris is quite by herself does the vision return. Did 
she see it, or was it a fantastic dream ? 

It is strange how much secret knowledge floods Doris 
suddenly. They have been less cautious before her per- 
haps, because they have fancied her blindly ignorant of 
many rather questionable things in the world ; but she is 
not so ignorant of honor and tmth and womanly delicacy, 
the fine instinct of self-possession. Has tliis made the 
subtle change in Graham, lowered the tone of manhood's 
belief and aims ? She stands spell-bound ; she shrinks as 
if some noisome thing had whirled by her, and would 
return a minute hence. 

That Frances is not satisfied or happy, she has long 
known, and she has experienced a curious sympathy with 
her. If she could only see the best there is in Basil ; if he 
could be fond or interested. He must have loved her, of 
course. Does he know hoio to love? How has she grown 
so wise ? Yet she longs in some unseen, occult manner to 
set all these people straight, between whom there are such 
sad intangible distances ; to open their eyes to the longing 
tenderness of the other soul. Oh ! why does God allow 
one to see, and yet keep him chained and helpless? If a 
word only stood between Agatha and Mr. Stirling, between 
Basil and his wife, she could not speak it ; she would have 
no right. Nor has she any right to confess the uncom- 
mitted sin of another. 

The wail sounds in her ears like some piteous plaint of 



 VjOOQIC 



 

the doomed. "What shall I do when you are gone?" 
It is the intense, the despairing question of love about to 
be torn from its object, — a wrong and sinful love, yet she 
pities Frances profoundly. Oh, thank God, there never 
could have been such a tangle in her life if Lloyd had 
lived ! She may not have chosen him with that marvellous 
singleness of election that she can imagine is the inspira- 
tion of love, but all her life, had it been half a century, 
she must have " kept to him only." 

There is nothing to be done but utter a fervent prayer 
for them both. Still, she cannot quite rid herself of a 
certain responsibility. Might she have saved Graham, 
might she have shaped and inspired his life to some nobler 
aspirations? Why is it that she has not been able to 
regard him with a wanner favor ? She would do all that 
a sister might, but it is the other great gift that a woman 
has no right to bestow in charity alone. Still, is not the 
sacrifice of one's life a noble object ? 

Doris reasons until she is confused, weary in soul and 
body. Is Frances doing anything beyond what many 
society women allow themselves, without any real scandal, 
only questioning comments ? Now and then Aunt Gilbert 
has regaled her unwilling ears with episodes that came 
under her notice while abroad, and they always call a hot 
flush of indignation to her face. She has heard of Miss 
Longford and the trouble at Florence with young Conyng- 
ham. " Though they need not have felt disturbed," she 
says, with a rather contemptuous smile, " for she never 
would have dreamed of marrying a young fellow like that, 
when there was higher game." 

Perhaps Basil's wife does not mean anything serious, 
but is just amusing herself. And Graham may not either. 
Indeed, was he serious in loving her? Doris starts with 
a little shock. Her tender heart has been quite distracted 
with these questions of duty, and how much one ought to 
do for another. But she suddenly Hghts up, — has she 



 



 



 

not been looking at it too seriously? Her ideas of the 
worid may not be the worid, after all. Well, then, she 
does not want very much of the worid. Still, she can see 
a wide difference between Agatha Stirling and Frances 
Wentworth ; and Mrs. Stirling is not satisfied deep in 
her soul, but, though she attracts men to her side, it is a 
clear, cold, intellectual attraction. Fancy any man beside 
her husband holding her in his arms! Doris shudders 
almost as if she had committed a capital crime in the 
mere thinking. 

The days go on with their various chances. The Lenox 
house is put in the keeping of some relatives ; husband, 
wife, baby, and nurse stai-t away in the highest of spirits. 
Certainly, this is a perfect marriage of its kind. Louise 
is radiantly happy ; Mr. Lenox shows his delight and ad- 
miration of his beautiful wife every hour of the day. 
They are both extremely fond of pleasure ; they are har- 
monious in every respect. Yes, they are happy, and yet 
— Doris cannot tell what fine, intangible grace is missing ; 
or it may be that she is unreasonable, that she looks 
for something not given to mortals. 

Judge Minturn does not seem to regain his usual 
strength, and he and Mrs. Howard go away for a change 
of air, the young girls being relegated to their aunt. At 
Stirling House there is a sundry packing away of choice 
and delicate belongings, and preparations for the winter 
abroad. 

Graham says his good-byes to everybody. There is 
quite a little for him to do in New York, and on Saturday 
the vessel sails at noon. He holds Doris's hand in a lin- 
gering clasp, that calls the conscious blood to her cheek. 
How purely sweet and fair she is this morning ; how she 
could set a man's life among all the high endeavors and 
make it better than his will ever be I He has striven that 
he might win her, and failed, not from anything in him- 
self, he thinks, but simply that she has not loved him. 



 



 



 

Can he blame her for any wreck that he may make of his 
future ?
