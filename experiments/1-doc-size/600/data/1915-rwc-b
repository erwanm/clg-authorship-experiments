romance : 

"Say, listen. Have a heart, Jack! We 
need the sleep!" 

Stick had already risen; Glenn shoved back 
his chair with a gigantic yawn and shambled 
to his feet. 

"I want to tell you," insisted Burley, "that 
she's what the French call tray, tray 
chick " 

Stick pointed furiously at the fowl: 

"Chick? I'm fed up on chick! Maybe she 
is some chick, as you say, but it doesn't in 
terest me. Goo bye. Don't come battering 
at my door and wake me up, Jack. Be a 
sport and lemme alone " 

He turned and shuffled out, and Glenn followed, his Mexican spurs clanking. 

Burley jeered them: 

"Mollycoddles! Come on and take in the 
town with us !" 

But they slammed the door behind them, 
and he heard them stumbling and clanking 
up stairs. 

So Burley, gazing gravely at his empty 









plate, presently emptied the last visible bottle of Bordeaux, then stretching his mighty 
arms and superb chest, fished out a cigarette, 
set fire to it, unhooked the cartridge-belt and 
holster from the back of his chair, buckled 
it on, rose, pulled on his leather-peaked cap, 
and drew a deep breath of contentment. 

For a moment he stood in the centre of 
the room, as though in pleasant meditation, 
then he slowly strode toward the street door, 
murmuring to himself : "Tray, tray chick. The 
prettiest girl in the world. ... La ploo belle 
fille du monde ... la ploo belle. . . ." 

He strolled as far as the corral down in 
the meadow by the stream, where he found 
the negro muleteers asleep and the mules 
already watered and fed. 

For a while he hobnobbed with the three 
gendarmes on duty there, practicing his kind 
of French on them and managing to under 
stand and be understood more or less prob 
ably less. 

But the young man was persistent; he desired to become that easy master of the 
French language that his tongue-tied comrades believed him to be. So he practiced 
garrulously upon the polite, suffering gendarmes. 

He related to them his experience on ship 
board with a thousand mutinous mules to 
pacify, feed, water, and otherwise cherish. 
They had, it appeared, encountered no sub 
marines, but enjoyed several alarms from 
destroyers which eventually proved to be 
British. 

"A cousin of mine," explained Burley, 
"Ned Winters, of El Paso, went down on the 
steamer John B. Doty, with eleven hundred 
mules and six niggers. The Boches torpedoed 
the ship and then raked the boats. I'd like 
to get a crack at one Boche before I go back 
to God's country." 

The gendarmes politely but regretfully 
agreed that it was impracticable for Burley 
to get a crack at a Hun; and the American 
presently took himself off to the corral, after 
distributing cigarettes and establishing cordial relations with the Sainte Lesse Gendarmerie. 

He waked up a negro and inspected the 








mules; that took a long time. Then he sought 
out the negro blacksmith, awoke him, and 
wrote out some directions. 

"The idea is," he explained, "that when 
ever the French in this sector need mules 
they draw on our corral. We are supposed 
to keep ten or eleven hundred mules here all 
the time and look after them. Shipments 
come every two weeks, I believe. So after 
you've had another good nap, George, you 
wake up your boys and get busy. And 
there'll be trouble if things are not in run 
ning order by tomorrow night." 

"Yas, suh, Mistuh Burley," nodded the 
sleepy blacksmith, still blinking in the after 
noon sunshine. 

"And if you need an interpreter," added 
Burley, "always call on me until you learn 
French enough to get on. Understand, 
George?" 

"Yas, suh." 

"Because," said Burley, walking away, "a 
thorough knowledge of French idioms is 
necessary to prevent mistakes. When in 
doubt always apply to me, George, for only 









a master of the language is competent to 
deal with these French people." 

It was his one vanity, his one weakness. 
Perhaps, because he so ardently desired pro 
ficiency, he had already deluded himself with 
the belief that he was a master of French. 

So, belt and loaded holster sagging, and 
large silver spurs clicking and clinking at 
every step, John Burley sauntered back along 
the almost deserted street of Sainte Lesse, 
thinking sometimes of his mules, sometimes 
of the French language, and every now and 
then of a dark-eyed, dark-haired girl whose 
delicately flushed and pensive gaze he had encountered as he had ridden into Sainte Lesse 
under the old belfry. 

"Stick Smith's a fool," he thought to himself impatiently. "Tray chick doesn't mean 
some chicken. It means a pretty girl, in 
French." 

He looked up at the belfry as he passed 
under it, and at the same moment, from beneath the high, gilded dragon which crowned 
its topmost spire, a sweet bell-note floated, 
another, others succeeding in crystalline 









sweetness, linked in a fragment of some an 
cient melody. Then they ceased; then came 
a brief silence; the great bell he had heard 
before struck five times. 

"Lord! that's pretty," he murmured, moving on and turning into the arched tunnel 
which was the entrance to the White Doe Inn. 

Wandering at random, he encountered the 
innkeeper in the parlour, studying a crumpled 
newspaper through horn-rimmed spectacles 
on his nose. 

"Tray jolie," said Burley affably, seating 
himself with an idea of further practice in 
French. 

"Plait-tit" 

"The bells tray beau!" 

The old man straightened his bent shoul 
ders a little proudly. 

"For thirty years, m sieu, I have been Caril- 
lonneur of Sainte Lesse." He smiled; then, 
saddened, he held out both hands toward Burley. The fingers were stiff and crippled with 
rheumatism. 

"No more," he said slowly; "the carillon is 








ended for me. The great art is no more for 
Jean Courtray, Master of Bells." 

"What is a carillon?" inquired John Burley 
simply. 

Blank incredulity was succeeded by a 
shocked expression on the old man's visage. 
After a silence, in mild and patient protest, 
he said: 

"I am Jean Courtray, Carillonneur of 
Sainte Lesse. . . . Have you never heard of 
the carillon of Sainte Lesse, or of me?" 

"Never," said Burley. "We don't have 
anything like that in America." 

The old carillonneur, Jean Courtray, began 
to speak in a low voice of his art, his profession, and of the great carillon of forty- 
six bells in the ancient tower of Sainte Lesse. 

A carillon, he explained, is a company of 
fixed bells tuned according to the chromatic 
scale and ranging through several octaves. 
These bells, rising tier above tier in a belfry, 
the smallest highest, the great, ponderous 
bells of the bass notes lowest, are not free 
to swing, but are fixed to huge beams, and 
are sounded by clappers connected by a wilderness of wires to a keyboard which is played 
upon by the bell-master or carillonneur. 

He explained that the office of bell-master 
was an ancient one and greatly honoured; 
that the bell-master was also a member of the 
municipal government; that his salary was a 
fixed one; that not only did he play upon the 
carillon on fete days, market days, and par 
ticular occasions, but he also travelled and 
gave concerts upon the few existing carillons 
of other ancient towns and cities, not alone 
in France where carillons were few, but in 
Belgium and Holland, where they still were 
comparatively many, although the German 
barbarians had destroyed some of the best at 
Liege, Arras, Dixmude, Termonde, and Ypres. 

"Monsieur," he went on in a voice which 
began to grow a little unsteady, "the Huns 
have destroyed the ancient carillons of Lou- 
vain and of Mechlin. In the superb bell- 
tower of Saint Rombold I have played for a 
thousand people; and the Carillonneur, Mon 
sieur Vincent, and the great bell-master, Josef 
Denyn, have come to me to congratulate me 
with tears in their eyes in their eyes 









There were tears in his own now, and he 
bent his white head and looked down at the 
worn floor nnder his crippled feet. 

"Alas," he said, "for Denyn and for Saint 
Rombold's tower. The Hun has passed that 
way." 

After a silence: 

"Who is it now plays the carillon in Sainte 
Lesse!" asked Burley. 

"My daughter, Maryette. Sainte Lesse has 
honoured me in my daughter, whom I myself 
instructed. My daughter the little child of 
my old age, monsieur is mistress of the bells 
of Sainte Lesse. . . . They call her Carillon- 
nette in Sainte Lesse " 

The door opened and the girl came in. 







CHAPTER XV 



Sticky Smith and Kid Glenn remained a 
week at Sainte Lesse, then left with the 
negroes for Calais to help bring up another 
cargo of mules, the arrival of which was daily 
expected. 

A peloton of the Train-des-Equipages and 
three Remount troopers arrived at Sainte 
Lesse to take over the corral. John Burley 
remained to explain and interpret the American mule to these perplexed troopers. 

Morning, noon, and night he went clanking 
down to the corral, his cartridge belt and 
holster swinging at his hip. But sometimes 
he had a little leisure. 

Sainte Lesse knew him as a mighty eater 
and as a lusty drinker of good red wine; as 
a mighty and garrulous talker, too, he be- 









came known, ready to accost anybody in the 
quiet and subdued old town and explode into 
French at the slightest encouragement. 

But Burley had only women and children 
and old men on whom to practice his earnest 
and voluble French, for everybody else was 
at the front. 

Children adored him adored his big, sil 
ver spurs, his cartridge belt and pistol, the 
metal mule decorating his tunic collar, his 
six feet two of height, his quick smile, the 
even white teeth and grayish eyes of this 
American muleteer, who always had a stick 
of barley sugar to give them or an amazing 
trick to perform for them with a handker 
chief or coin that vanished under their very 
noses at the magic snap of his finger. 

Old men gossiped willingly with him; 
women liked him and their rare smiles in the 
war-sobered town of Sainte Lesse were often 
for him as he sauntered along the quiet street, 
clanking, swaggering, affable, ready for conversation with anybody, and always ready for 
the small, confident hands that unceremoniously clasped his when lie passed by where 
children played. 

As for Maryette Courtray, called Carillon- 
nette, she mounted the bell-tower once every 
hour, from six in the morning until nine 
o clock in the evening, to play the passing of 
Time toward that eternity into which it is 
always and ceaselessly moving. 

After nine o clock Carillonnette set the drum 
and wound it; and through the dark hours of 
the night the bells played mechanically every 
hour for a few moments before Bayard 
struck. 

Between these duties the girl managed the 
old inn, to which, since the war, nobody came 
any more and with these occupations her life 
was full sufficiently full, perhaps, without 
the advent of John Burley. 

They met with enough frequency for her, 
if not for him. Their encounters took place 
between her duties aloft at the keyboard under the successive tiers of bells and his in 
tervals of prowling among his mules. 

Sometimes he found her sewing in the parlour she could have gone to her own room, 









of course; sometimes he encountered her in 
the corridor, in the street, in the walled garden behind the inn, where with basket and 
pan she gathered vegetables in season. 

There was a stone seat out there, built 
against the southern wall, and in the shad 
owed coolness of it she sometimes shelled 
peas. 

During such an hour of liberty from the 
bell-tower he found the dark-eyed little mistress of the bells sorting various vegetables 
and singing under her breath to herself the 
carillon music of Josef Denyn. 

"Tray chick, mademoiselle," he said, with 
a cheerful self-assertion, to hide the embarrassment which always assailed him when he 
encountered her. 

"You know, Monsieur Burley, you should 
not say tres chic to me," she said, shaking 
her pretty head. "It sounds a little familiar 
and a little common." 

"Oh," he exclaimed, very red. "I thought 
it was the thing to say." 

She smiled, continuing to shell the peas, 
then, with her sensitive and slightly flushed 









face still lowered, she looked at him out of 
her dark blue eyes. 

"Sometimes," she said, "young men say 
tres chic.  It depend on when and how one 
says it." 

"Are there times when it is all right for 
me to say it?" he inquired. 

"Yes, I think so. ... How are your mules 
today?" 

"The same," he said, " ready to bite or 
kick or eat their heads off. The Remount 
took two hundred this morning." 

"I saw them pass," said the girl. "I 
thought perhaps you also might be departing." 

"Without coming to say good-bye to you!" 
he stammered. 

"Oh, conventions must be disregarded in 
time of war," she returned carelessly, continuing to shell peas. "I really thought I 
saw you riding away with the mules." 

"That man," said Burley, much hurt, "was 
a bow-legged driver of the Train-des-Equi- 
pages. I don't think he resembles me." 

As she made no comment and expressed no 








contrition for her mistake, he gazed about 
him at the sunny garden with a depressed 
expression. However, this changed presently 
to a bright and hopeful one. 

"Vooz ate tray, tray belle, mademoiselle!" 
he asserted cheerfully. 

"Monsieur!" Vexed perhaps as much at 
her own quick blush as his abrupt eulogy, she 
bit her lip and looked at him with an ominously level gaze. Then, suddenly, she smiled. 

"Monsieur Burley, one does not so express 
one's self without reason, without apropos, 
without without encouragement " 

She blushed again, vividly. Under her wide 
straw hat her delicate, sensitive face and 
dark blue eyes were beautiful enough to inspire eulogy in any young man. 

"Pardon," he said, confused by her repri 
mand and her loveliness. "I shall hereafter 
only think you are pretty, mademoiselle mais 
je ne le dirais ploo." 

"That would be perhaps more comme il 
faut, monsieur." 

"Ploo!" he repeated with emphasis. "Ploo 
jamais! Je vous jure " 





"Merci; it is not perhaps necessary to 
swear quite so solemnly, monsieur." 

She raised her eyes from the pan, moving 
her small, sun-tanned hand through the heaps 
of green peas, filling her palm with them and 
idly letting them run through her slim fingers. 

"L amour," he said with an effort "how 
funny it is isn't it, mademoiselle?" 

"I know nothing about it," she replied with 
decision, and rose with her pan of peas. 

"Are you going, mademoiselle?" 

"Yes." 

"Have I offended you?" 

"No." 

He trailed after her down the garden path 
between rows of blue larkspurs and holly 
hocks just at her dainty heels, because the 
brick walk was too narrow for both of them. 

"Ploo," he repeated appealingly. 

Over her shoulder she said with disdain: 

"It is not a topic for conversation among 
the young, monsieur what you call I amour" 
And she entered the kitchen, where he had 
not the effrontery to follow her. 

That evening, toward sunset, returning 









from, the corral, he heard, high in the blue 
sky above him, her bell-music drifting; and 
involuntarily uncovering, he stood with bared 
head looking upward while the celestial melody lasted. 

And that evening, too, being the fete of 
Alincourt, a tiny neighbouring village across 
the river, the bell-mistress went up into the 
tower after dinner and played for an hour 
for the little neighbour hamlet across the 
river Lesse. 

All the people who remained in Sainte 
Lesse and in Alincourt brought out their 
chairs and their knitting in the calm, fragrant 
evening air and remained silent, sadly enraptured while the unseen player at her keyboard 
aloft in the belfry above set her carillon 
music adrift under the summer stars golden 
harmonies that seemed born in the heavens 
from which they floated; clear, exquisitely 
sweet miracles of melody filling the world of 
darkness with magic messages of hope. 

Those widowed or childless among her lis 
teners for miles around in the darkness wept 
quiet tears, less bitter and less hopeless for 









the divine promise of the sky music which 
filled the night as subtly as the scent of 
flowers saturates the dusk. 

Burley, listening down by the corral, leaned 
against a post, one powerful hand across his
