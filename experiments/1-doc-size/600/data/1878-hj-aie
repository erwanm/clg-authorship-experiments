him. 

"I say, we had better remain at the inn," rejoined his companion, presently.  I don 't think 
I like the way he spoke of his house. I don 't 
like stopping in the house with such a tremendous lot of women." 

" Oh, I don 't mind," said Lord Lambeth. And 
then they smoked a while in silence. " Fancy his 
thinking we do no work in England !" the young 
man resumed. 

"I dare say he didn 't really think so," said 
Percy Beaumont. 

" Well, I guess they don 't know much about 
England over here !" declared Lord Lambeth, 
humorously. And then there was another long 

pause. "He was devilish civil," observed the 
young nobleman. 

" Nothing, certainly, could have been more civil," rejoined his companion. 

"Littledale said his wife was great fun," said 
Lord Lambeth. 

" Whose wife Littledale 's ?" 

"This American 's Mrs. Westgate. What 's 
his name ? J. L." 

Beaumont was silent a moment. " What was 
fun to Littledale," he said at last, rather sententious, " may be death to us." 

" What do you mean by that ?" asked his 
kinsman. "I am as good a man as Little- 
dale." 

" My dear boy, I hope you won 't begin to flirt," 
said Percy Beaumont. 

" I don 't care. I dare say I sha n't begin." 

" With a married woman, if she 's bent upon it, 
it 's all very well," Beaumont expounded. " But 
our friend mentioned a young lady a sister, a 
sister-in-law. For God 's sake, don 't get entangled 
with her !" 

" How do you mean entangled ?" 

" Depend upon it she will try to hook you." 

" Oh, bother !" said Lord Lambeth. 

"American girls are very clever," urged his 
companion. 


" So much the better," the young man declared. 

" I fancy they are always up to some game of 
that sort," Beaumont continued. 

" They can 't be worse than they are in England," 
said Lord Lambeth, judicially. 

" Ah, but in England," replied Beaumont, " you 
have got your natural protectors. You have got 
your mother and sisters." 

" My mother and sisters " began the young 
nobleman, with a certain energy. But he stopped 
in time, puffing at his cigar. 

" Your mother spoke to me about it, with tears 
in her eyes," said Percy Beaumont. u She said she 
felt very nervous. I promised to keep you out of 
mischief." 

" You had better take care of yourself," said 
the object of maternal and ducal solicitude. 

" Ah," rejoined the young barrister, " I haven 't 
the expectation of a hundred thousand a year, 
not to mention other attractions." 

" Well," said Lord Lambeth, " don 't cry out be 
fore you 're hurt !" 

It was certainly very much cooler at Newport, 
where our travellers found themselves assigned 
to a couple of diminutive bedrooms in a far-away 
angle of an immense hotel. They had gone ashore 
in the early summer twilight, and had very promptly put themselves to bed ; thanks to which circumstance
and to their having, during the previous 
hours, in their commodious cabin, slept the sleep 
of youth and health, they began to feel, toward 
eleven o clock, very alert and inquisitive. They 
looked out of their windows across a row of small 
green fields, bordered with low stone wails of rude 
construction, and saw a deep blue ocean lying be 
neath a deep blue sky, and flecked now and then 
with scintillating patches of foam. A strong, 
fresh breeze came in through the curtainless case 
ments, and prompted our young men to observe, 
generally, that it didn 't seem half a bad climate. 
They made other observations after they had 
emerged from their rooms in pursuit of break 
fast a meal of which they partook in a huge bare 
hall, where a hundred negroes, in white jackets, 
were shuffling about upon an uncarpeted floor; 
where the flies were superabundant, and the tables 
and dishes covered over with a strange, volumi 
nous integument of coarse blue gauze ; and where 
several little boys and girls, who had risen late, 
were seated in fastidious solitude at the morning 
repast. These young persons had not the morning paper before them, but they were engaged in 
languid perusal of the bill of fare. 

This latter document was a great puzzle to our 
friends, who, on reflecting that its bewildering 
categories had relation to breakfast alone, had an 
uneasy prevision of an encyclopedic dinner list. 
They found a great deal of entertainment at the 
hotel, an enormous wooden structure, for the erection of which it seemed to them that the virgin 
forests of the West must have been terribly deflowered. It was perforated from end to end with 
immense bare corridors, through which a strong 
draught was blowing bearing along wonderful 
figures of ladies in white morning dresses and 
clouds of Valenciennes lace, who seemed to float 
down the long vistas with expanded furbelows, 
like angels spreading their wings. In front was 
a gigantic veranda, upon which an army might 
have encamped a vast wooden terrace, with a 
roof as lofty as the nave of a cathedral. Here our young Englishmen enjoyed, as they supposed, 
a glimpse of American society, which was distributed over the measureless expanse in a variety of 
sedentary attitudes, and appeared to consist large 
ly of pretty young girls, dressed as if for a fete 
champetre, swaying to and fro in rocking-chairs, 
fanning themselves with large straw fans, and en 
joying an enviable exemption from social cares. 
Lord Lambeth had a theory, which it might be 
interesting to trace to its origin, that it would be 
not only agreeable, but easily possible, to enter 
into relations with one of these young ladies : and 
his companion (as he had done a couple of days 

before) found occasion to check the young noble 
man 's colloquial impulses. 

" You had better take care," said Percy Beaumont, " or you will have an offended father or 
brother pulling out a bowie-knife." 

"I assure you it is all right," Lord Lambeth 
replied. " You know the Americans come to these 
big hotels to make acquaintances." 

" I know nothing about it, and neither do you," 
said his kinsman, who, like a clever man, had be 
gun to perceive that the observation of Ameri 
can society demanded a re-adjustment of one 's 
standard. 

" Hang it, then, let 's find out !" cried Lord Lambeth, with some impatience. " You know I don 't 
want to miss any thing." 

" We will find out," said Percy Beaumont, very 
reasonably. " We will go and see Mrs. Westgate, 
and make all the proper inquiries." 

And so the two inquiring Englishmen, who had 
this lady 's address inscribed in her husband 's hand 
upon a card, descended from the veranda of the 
big hotel and took their way, according to direction, along a large straight road, past a series of 
fresh-looking villas embosomed in shrubs and 
flowers, and inclosed in an ingenious variety of 
wooden palings. The morning was brilliant and 
cool, the villas were smart and snug, and the walk 
of the young travellers was very entertaining. 
Every thing looked as if it had received a coat of 
fresh paint the day before the red roofs, the 
green shutters, the clean, bright browns and buffs 
of the house fronts. The flower beds on the little 
lawns seemed to sparkle in the radiant air, and 
the gravel in the short carriage sweeps to flash 
and twinkle. Along the road came a hundred little basket-phaetons, in which, almost always, a 
couple of ladies were sitting ladies in white 
dresses and long white gloves, holding the reins 
and looking at the two Englishmen, whose nation 
ality was not elusive, through thick blue veils tied 
tightly about their faces as if to guard their complexions. At last the young men came within 
sight of the sea again, and then, having interrogated a gardener over the paling of a villa, they 
turned into an open gate. Here they found them 
selves face to face with the ocean and with a very 
picturesque structure, resembling a magnified cha 
let, which was perched upon a green embankment 
just above it. The house had a veranda of extraordinary width all around it, and a great many 
doors and windows standing open to the veranda. 
These various apertures had, in common, such an 
accessible, hospitable air, such a breezy flutter 
within of light curtains, such expansive thresh 
olds and re-assuring interiors, that our friends hardly 
knew which was the regular entrance, and, aft 
er hesitating a moment, presented themselves at 
one of the windows. The room within was dark, 
but in a moment a graceful figure vaguely shaped 
itself in the rich-looking gloom, and a lady came 
to meet them. Then they saw that she had been 
seated at a table writing, and that she had heard 
them and had got up. She stepped out into the 
light; she wore a frank, charming smile, with 
which she held out her hand to Percy Beaumont. 

" Oh, you must be Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beau 
mont," she said. " I have heard from my husband 
that you would come. I am extremely glad to see 
you." And she shook hands with each of her visitors. Her visitors were a little shy, but they had 
very good manners ; they responded with smiles 
and exclamations, and they apologized for not 
knowing the front-door. The lady rejoined, with 
vivacity, that when she wanted to see people very 
much she did not insist upon those distinctions, 
and that Mr. Westgate had written to her of his 
English friends in terms that made her really 
anxious. "He said you were so terribly pros 
trated," said Mrs. Westgate. 

"Oh, you mean by the heat?" replied Percy 
Beaumont. " We were rather knocked up, but we 
feel wonderfully better. We had such a jolly a 
voyage down here. It 's so very good of you to 
mind." 

"Yes, it 's so very kind of you," murmured 
Lord Lambeth. 

Mrs. Westgate stood smiling ; she was extreme 
ly pretty. " Well, I did mind," she said ; " and I 
thought of sending for you this morning to the 
Ocean House. I am very glad you are better, and 
I am charmed you have arrived. You must come 
round to the other side of the piazza." And she 
led the way, with a light, smooth step, looking 
back at the young men and smiling. 

The other side of the piazza was, as Lord Lam 
beth presently remarked, a very jolly place. It 
was of the most liberal proportions, and with its 
awnings, its fanciful chairs, its cushions and rugs, 
its view of the ocean, close at hand, tumbling along 
the base of the low cliffs whose level tops intervened in lawn-like smoothness, it formed a charming complement to the drawing-room. As such 
it was in course of use at the present moment ; it 
was occupied by a social circle. There were several ladies and two or three gentlemen, to whom 
Mrs. Westgate proceeded to introduce the distinguished strangers. She mentioned a great many 
names very freely and distinctly ; the young Englishmen, shuffling about and bowing, were rath 
er bewildered. But at last they were provided
with chairs low, wicker chairs, gilded, and tied 
with a great many ribbons and one of the ladies 
(a very young person, with a little snub-nose and 
several dimples) offered Percy Beaumont a fan. 
The fan was also adorned with pink love-knots ; 
but Percy Beaumont declined it, although he was 
very hot. Presently, however, it became cooler ; 
the breeze from the sea was delicious, the view 
was charming, and the people sitting there looked exceedingly fresh and comfortable. Several 
of the ladies seemed to be young girls, and the 
gentlemen were slim, fair youths, such as our 
friends had seen the day before in New York. 
The ladies were working upon bands of tapestry, 
and one of the young men had an open book in 
his lap. Beaumont afterward learned from one 
of the ladies that this young man had been read 
ing aloud, that he was from Boston, and was very 
fond of reading aloud. Beaumont said it was a 
great pity that they had interrupted him ; he 
should like so much (from all he had heard) to 
hear a Bostonian read. Couldn 't the young man 
be induced to go on ? 

"Oh no," said his informant, very freely; "he 
wouldn 't be able to get the young ladies to attend 
to him now." 

There was something very friendly, Beaumont 
perceived, in the attitude of the company ; they 
looked at the young Englishmen with an air of animated sympathy and interest ; they smiled, bright 
ly and unanimously, at every thing either of the 
visitors said. Lord Lambeth and his companion 
felt that they were being made very welcome. 
Mrs. Westgate seated herself between them, and, 
talking a great deal to each, they had occasion to 
observe that she was as pretty as their friend 
Littledale had promised. She was thirty years 
old, with the eyes and the smile of a girl of seventeen, and she was extremely light and graceful, 
elegant, exquisite. Mrs. Westgate was extremely 
spontaneous. She was very frank and demonstrative, and appeared always while she looked 
at you delightedly with her beautiful young eyes 
to be making sudden confessions and concessions, after momentary hesitations. 

" We shall expect to see a great deal of you," 
she said to Lord Lambeth, with a kind of joyous 
earnestness. " We are very fond of Englishmen 
here; that is, there are a great many we have 
been fond of. After a day or two you must come 
and stay with us ; we hope you will stay a long 
time. Newport 's a very nice place when you 
come really to know it, when you know plenty 
of people. Of course you and Mr. Beaumont 
will have no difficulty about that. Englishmen 
are very well received here ; there are almost always
two or three of them about. I think they 
always like it, and I must say I should think they 
would. They receive ever so much attention. I 
must say I think they sometimes get spoiled ; but 
I am sure you and Mr. Beaumont are proof against 
that. My husband tells me you are a friend of 
Captain Littledale ; he was such a charming man. 
He made himself most agreeable here, and I am 
sure I wonder he didn 't stay. It couldn 't have 
been pleasanter for him in his own country, 
though, I suppose, it is very pleasant in England, 
for English people. I don 't know myself ; I 
have been there very little. I have been a great 
deal abroad, but I am always on the Continent. 
I must say I'm extremely fond of Paris ; you 
know we Americans always are ; we go there 
when we die. Did you ever hear that before? 
that was said by a great wit, I mean the good 
Americans ; but we are all good ; you'll see that 
for yourself. All I know of England is London, 
and all I know of London is that place on that 
little corner, you know, where you buy jackets 
jackets with that coarse braid and those big buttons. They make very good jackets in London, 
I will do you the justice to say that. And some 
people like the hats ; but about the hats I was 
always a heretic ; I always got my hats in Paris. 
You can 't wear an English hat at least I never 
could unless you dress your hair d 'Anglaise ; 
and I must say that is a talent I have never 
possessed. In Paris they will make things to 
suit your peculiarities ; but in England I think 
you like much more to have how shall I say it ? 
one thing for every body. I mean as regards 
dress. I don 't know about other things ; but I 
have always supposed that in other things every 
thing was different. I mean according to the 
people according to the classes, and all that. I 
am afraid you will think that I don 't take a very 
favorable view ; but you know you can 't take a 
very favorable view in Dover Street in the month 
of November. That has always been my fate. 
Do you know Jones 's Hotel in Dover Street? 
That 's all I know of England. Of course every one admits that the English hotels are your 
weak point. There was always the most fright 
ful fog; I couldn 't see to try my things on. 
When I got over to America into the light 
I usually found they were twice too big. The 
next time I mean to go in the season ; I think 
I shall go next year. I want very much to take 
my sister; she has never been to England. I 
don 't know whether you know what I mean by 
eaying that the Englishmen who come here some 
times get spoiled. I mean that they take things 
as a matter of course things that are done for 
them. Now, naturally, they are only a matter of 
course when the Englishmen are very nice. But, 
of course, they are almost always very nice. Of 
course this isn't nearly such an interesting coun 
try as England ; there are not nearly so many 
things to see, and we haven 't your country life. 
I have never seen any thing of your country life ; 
when I am in Europe I am always on the Continent. But I have heard a great deal about it ; I 
know that when you are among yourselves in the 
country you have the most beautiful time. Of 
course we have nothing of that sort, we have 
nothing on that scale. I don 't apologize, Lord 
Lambeth ; some Americans are always apologizing ; you must have noticed that. We have the 
reputation of always boasting and bragging and 
waving the American flag ; but I must say that 
what strikes me is that we are perpetually making excuses, and trying to smooth things over. 
The American flag has quite gone out of fashion; it 's very carefully folded up, like an old 
table-cloth. Why should we apologize? The 
English never apologize do they ? Xo ; I must 
say I never apologize. You must take us as we 
come with all our imperfections on our heads. 
Of course we haven 't your country life, and your 
old ruins, and your great estates, and your leisure 
class, and ail that. But if we haven 't, I should 
think you might find it a pleasant change I think 
any country is pleasant where they have pleasant 
manners. Captain Littledale told me he had never seen such pleasant manners as at Newport, 
and he had been a great deal in European society. Hadn 't he been in the diplomatic service? 
He told me the dream of his life was to get ap 
pointed to a diplomatic post in Washington. But 
he doesn 't seem to have succeeded. I suppose 
that in England promotion and all that sort of 
thing is fearfully slow. With us, you know, it 's 
a great deal too fast. You see, I admit our draw 
backs. But I must confess I think Newport is 
an ideal place. I don 't know any thing like it 
any where. Captain Littledale told me he didn 't 
know any thing like it any where. It 's entirely 
different from most watering-places ; it 's a most 
charming life. I must say I think that when 
one goes to a foreign country one ought to en 
joy the differences. Of course there are differences, otherwise what did one come abroad for ? 
Look for your pleasure in the differences, Lord 
Lambeth ; that 's the way to do it ; and then I am 
sure you will find American society at least Newport society most charming and most interesting. I wish very much my husband were here ; but he 's dreadfully confined to New York. I 
suppose you think that is very strange for a 
gentleman. But you see we haven 't any leisure 
class." 

Mrs. "Westgate 's discourse, delivered in a soft, 
sweet voice, flowed on like a miniature torrent, 
and was interrupted by a hundred little smiles, 
glances, and gestures, which might have figured 
the irregularities and obstructions of such a 
stream. Lord Lambeth listened to her with, it 
must be confessed, a rather ineffectual attention, 
although he indulged in a good many little mur 
murs and ejaculations of assent and deprecation. 
He had no great faculty for apprehending gener 
alizations. There were some three or four indeed 
which, in the play of his own intelligence, he had 
originated, and which had seemed convenient at 
the moment ; but at the present time he could 
hardly have been said to follow Mrs. Westgate as 
she darted gracefully about in the sea of speculation. Fortunately she asked for no especial rejoinder, for she looked about at the rest of the 
company as well, and smiled at Percy Beaumont, 
on the other side of her, as if he too must understand her and agree with her. He was rather 
more successful than his companion ; for besides 
being, as we know, cleverer, his attention was not 
vaguely distracted by close vicinity to a remarkably interesting young girl, with dark hair and 
blue eyes. This was the case with Lord Lambeth, 
to whom it occurred after a while that the 
young girl with blue eyes and dark hair was the 
pretty sister of whom Mrs. Westgate had spoken. 
She presently turned to him with a remark which 
established her identity. 

" It 's a great pity you couldn 't have brought 
my brother-in-law with you. It 's a great shame 
he should be in New York in these days." 

" Oh yes ; it 's so very hot," said Lord Lambeth. 

" It must be dreadful," said the young girl. 

"I dare say he is very busy," Lord Lambeth 
observed. 

" The gentlemen in America work too much," 
the young girl went on. 

" Oh, do they ? I dare say they like it," said 
her interlocutor. 

" I don 't like it. One never sees them." 

"Don 't you, really?" asked Lord Lambeth. 
" I shouldn 't have fancied that." 

" Have you come to study American manners ?" 
asked the young girl. 

"Oh, I don 't know. I just came over for a 
lark. I haven 't got long." Here there was a 
pause, and Lord Lambeth began again. "But 
Mr. Westgate will come down here, will not he ?" 

"I certainly hope he will. He must help to 
entertain you and Mr. Beaumont." 





Lord Lambeth looked at her a little with his 
handsome brown eyes. "Do you suppose he 
would have come down with us if we had urged 
him ?" 

Mr. Westgate 's sister-in-law was silent a moment, and then, " I dare say he would," she answered. 

" Really !" said the young Englishman. " He 
was immensely civil to Beaumont and me," he 
added. 

"He is a dear good fellow," the young lady 
rejoined, " and he is a perfect husband. But all 
Americans are that," she continued, smiling. 

" Really !" Lord Lambeth exclaimed again, 
and wondered whether all American ladies had 
such a passion for generalizing as these two. 

He sat there a good while : there was a great 
deal of talk ; it was all very friendly and lively 
and jolly. Every one present, sooner or later, 
said something to him, and seemed to make a 
particular point of addressing him by name. 
Two or three other persons came in, and there 
was a shifting of seats and changing of places ; 
the gentlemen all entered into intimate conversation with the two Englishmen, made them ur 
gent offers of hospitality, and hoped they might 
frequently be of service to them. They were 
afraid Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beaumont were not 
very comfortable at their hotel ; that it was not, 
as one of them said, " so private as those dear 
little English inns of yours." This last gentle 
man went on to say that unfortunately, as yet, 
perhaps, privacy was not quite so easily obtained 
in America as might be desired ; still, he con 
tinued, you could generally get it by paying for 
it ; in fact, you could get every thing in America 
nowadays by paying for it. American life was 
certainly growing a great deal more private ; it 
was growing very much like England. Every 
thing at Newport, for instance, was thoroughly 
private ; Lord Lambeth would probably be struck 
with that. It was also represented to the strangers that it mattered very little whether their 
hotel was agreeable, as every one would want 
them to make visits ; they would stay with other 
people, and, in any case, they would be a great 
deal at Mrs. Westgate's. They would find that 
very charming; it was the pleasantest house in 
Newport. It was a pity Mr. Westgate was al 
ways away ; he was a man of the highest ability 
very acute, very acute. lie worked like a 
horse, and he left his wife well, to do about as 
she liked. He liked her to enjoy herself, and 
she seemed to know how. She was extremely 
brilliant, and a splendid talker. Some people 
preferred her sister; but Miss Alden was very 
different ; she was in a different style altogether. 
Some people even thought her prettier, and, certainly, she was not so sharp. She was more in 
the Boston style ; she had lived a great deal in 
Boston, and she was very highly educated. Boston girls, it was propounded, were more like 
English young ladies. 

' Lord Lambeth had presently a chance to test 
the truth of this proposition, for on the company rising in compliance with a suggestion from 
their hostess that they should walk down to the 
rocks and look at the sea, the young Englishman 
again found himself, as they strolled across the 
grass, in proximity to Mrs. Westgate 's sister. 
Though she was but a girl of twenty, she appeared to feel the obligation to exert an active hospitality ; and this was, perhaps, the more to be 
noticed as she seemed by nature a reserved and 
retiring person, and had little of her sister 's fraternizing quality. She was perhaps rather too 
thin, and she was a little pale ; but as she moved 
slowly over the grass, with her arms hanging at 
her sides, looking gravely for a moment at the 
sea and then brightly, for all her gravity, at him, 
Lord Lambeth thought her at least as pretty as 
Mrs. Westgate, and reflected that if this was the 
Boston style the Boston style was very charming. 
He thought she looked very clever; he 
could imagine that she was highly educated ; but 
at the same time she seemed gentle and graceful. 
For all her cleverness, however, he felt that she 
had to think a little what to say; she didn 't say 
the first thing that came into her head ; he had 
come from a different part of the world and 
from a different society, and she was trying to 
adapt her conversation. The others were scattering themselves near the rocks ; Mrs. Westgate had charge of Percy Beaumont. 

" Very jolly place, isn't it ?" said Lord Lambeth. 
" It 's a very jolly place to sit." 

" Very charming," said the young girl. " I often sit here ; there are all kinds of cozy corners 
as if they had been made on purpose." 

" Ah ! I suppose you have had some of them 
made," said the young man. 

Miss Alden looked at him a moment. " Oh no, 
we have had nothing made. It 's pure nature." 

" I should think you would have a few little 
benches rustic seats and that sort of thing. It 
might be so jolly to sit here, you know," Lord 
Lambeth went on. 

" I am afraid we haven 't so many of those things 
as you," said the young girl, thoughtfully. 

" I dare say you go in for pure nature, as you 
were saying. Nature over here must be so grand, 
you know." And Lord Lambeth looked about him. 

The little coast-line hereabouts was very pretty, but it was not at all grand, and Miss Aldeu 
appeared to rise to a perception of this fact. " I 
am afraid it seems to you very rough," she said. 
"It 's not like the coast scenery in Kingsley 's 
novels." 

"Ah, the novels always overdo it, you know," 
Lord Lambeth rejoined. " You must not go by
