greatest sort of success ; you were formed for it. It 
wasn 't your beauty alone ; lots of pretty girls don 't 
make anything of their beauty ; it was your tempera 
ment. You took things easily and naturally, and 
that 's what the world likes. It doesn 't like your be 
ing afraid of it, and you were not afraid, and you 
were not bold ; you were just right." Miss Milray 
grew more and more exhaustive in her analysis, and 
enjoyed refining upon it. " All that you needed was 
a little hard-heartedness, and that would have come 
in time ; you would have learned how to hold your 
own, but the chance was snatched from you by that 
old cat ! I could weep over you when I think how 
you have been wasted on her, and now you 're actually 
willing to go back and lose yourself in the woods ! " 

" I shouldn 't call it being lost, Miss Milray." 

" I don 't mean that, and you must excuse me, my 
dear. But surely your people your father and 
mother would want to have you get on in the world 
to make a brilliant match "- 

Clementina smiled to think how far such a thing 
was from their imaginations. " I don 't believe they 
would ca e. You don 't undastand about them, and I 



 

couldn 't make you. Fatha neva liked the notion of 
my being with such a rich woman as Mrs. Lander, 
because it would look as if we wanted her money." 

" I never could have imagined that of you, Clemen 
tina ! " 

" I didn 't think you could," said the girl gratefully. 
" But now, if I left her when she was sick and de 
pended on me, it would look wohse, yet as if I did 
it because she was going to give her money to Mr. 
Landa 's family. She wants to do that, and I told her 
to ; I think that would be right ; don 't you ? " 

" It would be right for you, Clementina, if you 
preferred it and I  should prefer it. But it wouldn 't 
be right for her. She has given you hopes she has 
made promises she has talked to everybody."

" I don 't care for that. I shouldn 't like to feel be 
holden to any one, and I think it really belongs to his 
relations; it was his. n 

Miss Milray did not say anything to this. She 
asked, " And if you went back, what would you do 
there ? Labor in the fields, as poor little Belsky ad 
vised ? " 

Clementina laughed. "No; but I expect you 'll 
think it 's almost as crazy. You know how much I 
like dancing? "Well, I think I could give dancing 
lessons at the Middlemount. There are always a good 
many children, and girls that have not grown up, and 
I guess I could get pupils enough, as long as the 
summa lasted ; and come winter, I 'm not afraid but 
what I could get them among the young folks at the 
Center. I used to teach them before I left home." 





Miss Milray sat looking at her. " I don 't know 
about such things ; but it sounds sensible like every 
thing about you, my dear. It sounds queer, perhaps 
because you 're talking of such a White Mountain 
scheme here in Venice." 

" Yes, don 't it ? " said Clementina sympathetically. 
" I was thinking of that, myself. But I know I could 
do it. I could go round to different hotels, different 
days. Yes, I should like to go home, and they would 
be glad to have me. You can 't think how pleasantly 
we live ; and we 're company enough for each other. I 
presume I should miss the things I 've  got used to over 
here, at fust ; but I don 't believe I should care a great 
while. I don 't deny but what the wo ld is nice ; but 
you have to pay for it ; I don 't mean that you would 
make me " 

" No, no ! We understand each other. Go on ! " 
Miss Milray leaned towards her and pressed the girl 's 
arm reassuringly. 

As often happens with people when they are told 
to go on, Clementina found that she had not much 
more to say. " I think I could get along in the 
wo ld, well enough. Yes, I believe I could do it. 
But I wasn 't bohn to it, and it would be a great deal 
of trouble a great deal moa than if I had been bohn 
to it. I think it would be too much trouble. I would 
rather give it up and go home, when Mrs. Landa wants 
to go back." 

Miss Milray did not speak for a time. " I know 
that you are serious, Clementina ; and you 're wise 
always, and good " 



" It isn 't that, exactly," said Clementina. " But is 
it I don 't know how to express it very well is it 
wo th while ? " 

Miss Milray looked at her as if she doubted the 
girl 's sincerity. Even when the world, in return for 
our making it our whole life, disappoints and defeats 
us with its prizes, we still question the truth of those 
who question the value of these prizes ; we think they 
must be hopeless of them, or must be governed by 
some interest momentarily superior. 

Clementina pursued, " I know that you have had 
all you wanted of the wo ld" 

" Oh, no ! " the woman broke out, almost in an 
guish. " Not what I wanted! What I tried for. It 
never gave me what I wanted. It couldn 't ! " 

"Well?" 

" It isn 't worth while in that sense. But if you 
can 't have what you want, if there 's been a hollow 
left in your life why the world goes a great way 
towards filling up the aching void." The tone of the 
last words was lighter than their meaning, but Clem 
entina weighed them aright. 

" Miss Milray," she said, pinching the edge of the 
table by which she sat, a little nervously, and hanging 
her head a little, " I think I can have what I want." 

" Then, give the whole world for it, child ! " 

" There is something I should like to tell you." 

" Yes ! " 

" For you to advise me about." 

" I will, my dear, gladly and truly ! " 

" He was here before you came. He asked me " 



 

Miss Milray gave a start of alarm. She said, to 
gain time : " How did he get here ? I supposed he 
was in Germany with his " 

" No ; he was here the whole of May " 

" Mr. Gregory ! " 

" Mr. Gregory ? " Clementina 's face flushed and 
drooped still lower. " I meant Mr. Hinkle. But if 
you think I oughtn 't " 

" I don 't think anything ; I 'm so glad ! I supposed 
from what you said about the world, that it must be 
But if it isn t, all the better. If it 's Mr. Hinkle that 
you can have " 

" I 'm not sure I can. I should like to tell you just 
how it is, and then you will know." It needed fewer 
words for this than she expected, and then Clemen 
tina, took a letter from her pocket, and gave it to Miss 
Milray. " He wrote it on the train, going away, and 
it 's not very plain ; but I guess you can make it out." 

Miss Milray received the penciled leaves, which 
seemed to be pages torn out of a note-book. They 
were dated the day Hinkle left Venice, and the en 
velope bore the postmark of Verona. They were not 
addressed, but began abruptly : " I believe I have 
made a mistake ; I ought not to have given you up 
till I knew something that no one but you can tell me. 
You are not bound to any body unless you wish to be 
so. That is what I see now, and I will not give you 
up if I can help it. Even if you had made a promise, 
and then changed your mind, you would not be bound 
in such a thing as this. I say this, and I know you 
will not believe I say it because I want you. I do 



 

want yon, but I would not urge you to break your 
faith. I only ask you to realize that if you kept your 
word when your heart had gone out of it, you would 
be breaking your faith ; and if you broke your word 
you would be keeping your faith. But if your heart 
is still in your word, I have no more to say. Nobody 
knows but you. I would get out and take the first 
train back to Venice if it were not for two things. I 
know it would be hard on me ; and I am afraid it 
might be hard on you. But if you will write me a 
line at Milan, when you get this, or if you will write 
to me at London before July ; or at New York at 
any time for I expect to wait as long as I live " 

The letter ended here in the local addresses which 
the writer gave. 

Miss Milray handed the leaves back to Clementina, 
who put them into her pocket, and apparently waited 
for her questions. 

"And have you written?" 

" No," said the girl, slowly and thoughtfully, " I 
haven t. I wanted to, at fust ; and then, I thought 
that if he truly meant what he said he would be will 
ing to wait." 

" And why did you want to wait ? " 

Clementina replied with a question of her own. 
" Miss Milray, what do you think about Mr. Gregory ? " 

" Oh, you mustn 't ask me that, my dear ! I was 
afraid I had told you too plainly, the last time." 

" I don 't mean about his letting me think he didn 't 
ca e for me, so long. But don 't you think he wants 
to do what is right ! Mr. Gregory, I mean." 



 

" Well, if you put me on my honor, I 'm afraid I do. 

" You see," Clementina resumed. " He was the 
fust one, and I did ca e for him a great deal ; and I 
might have gone on caring for him, if When I 
found out that I didn 't care any longer, or so much, 
it seemed to me as if it must be wrong. Do you 
think it was ? " 

"No no." 

" When I got to thinking about some one else 
at fust it was only not thinking about himI, was 
ashamed. Then I tried to make out that I was too 
young in the fust place, to know whether I really 
ca ed for any one in the right way ; but after I made 
out that I was, I couldn 't feel exactly easy ; and I 've  
been wanting to ask you, Miss Milray "- 

" Ask me anything you like, my dear ! " 

" Why, it 's only whether a person ought eva to 
change " 

" We change whether we ought, or not. It isn 't a 
matter of duty, one way or another." 

" Yes, but ought we to stop caring for somebody, 
when perhaps we shouldn 't if somebody else hadn 't 
come between ? That is the question." 

" No," Miss Milray retorted, " that isn 't at all the 
question. The question is which you want and 
whether you could get him. Whichever you want 
most it is right for you to have." 

" Do you truly think so ? " 

" I do, indeed. This is the one thing in life where 
one may choose safest what one likes best ; I mean 
if there is nothing bad in the man himself." 



" I was afraid it would be wrong ! That was what 
I meant by wanting to be fai a with Mr. Gregory when 
I told you about him there in Florence. I don 't be 
lieve but what it had begun then." 

" What had begun ? " 

"About Mr. Hinkle." 

Miss Milray burst into a laugh. "Clementina, 
you 're delicious ! " The girl looked hurt, and Miss 
Milray asked seriously, " Why do you like Mr. Hinkle 
best if you do ? " 

Clementina sighed. " Oh, I don 't know. He 's so 
resting" 

" Then that settles it. From first to last, what we 
poor women want is rest. It would be a wicked thing 
for you to throw your life away on some one who 
would worry you out of it. I don 't wish to say any 
thing against Mr. Gregory. I dare say he is good 
and conscientious ; but life is a struggle, at the best, 
and it 's your duty to take the best chance for rest- 
ing." 

Clementina did not look altogether convinced, 
whether it was Miss Milray 's logic or her morality 
that failed to convince her. She said, after a moment, 
" I should like to see Mr. Gregory again." 

" What good would that do ? " 

" Why, then I should know." 

" Know what ? " 

" Whether I didn 't really ca e for him any more 
or so much." 

" Clementina," said Miss Milray, " you mustn 't 
make me lose patience with you ! " 


" No. But I thought you said that it was my duty 
to do what I wished." 

" Well, yes. That is what I said," Miss Mil ray 
consented. " But I supposed that you knew already." 

" No," said Clementina, candidly, " I don 't believe 
I do." 

" And what if you don 't see him ? " 

" I guess I shall have to wait till I do. The e will 
be time enough." 

Miss Milray sighed, and then she laughed. " You 
are young ! " 



XXXII. 

Miss Milray went from Clementina to call upon her 
sister-in-law, and found her brother, which was per 
haps what she hoped might happen. 

" Do you know," she said, " that that old wretch is 
going to defraud that poor thing, after all, and leave 
her money to her husband 's half-sister 's children ? " 

" You wish me to infer the Mrs. Lander-Clementina 
situation ? " Milray returned. 

" Yes ! " 

" I 'm glad you put it in terms that are not action 
able, then ; for your words are decidedly libellous." 

" What do you mean ? " 

" I 've  just been writing Mrs. Lander 's will for her, 
and she 's left all her property to Clementina, except 
five thousand apiece to the half-sister 's three children." 

" I can 't believe it ! " 

"Well," said Milray, with his gentle smile, "I 
think that 's safe ground for you. Mrs. Lander will 
probably have time enough to change her will as well 
as her mind several times yet before she dies. The 
half-sister 's children may get their rights yet." 

" I wish they might ! " said Miss Milray, with an 



 

impassioned sigh. " Then perhaps I should get Clem 
entina for a while." 

Her brother laughed. " Isn 't there somebody else 
wants Clementina ? " 

" Oh, plenty. But she 's not sure she wants any 
body else." 

" Does she want you ? " 

" No, I can 't say she does. She wants to go home." 

" That 's not a bad scheme. I should like to go 
home myself if I had one. What would you have 
done with Clementina if you had got her, Jenny ? " 

" What would any one have done with her ? Mar 
ried her brilliantly, of course." 

" But you say she isn 't sure she wishes to be mar 
ried at all ? " 

Miss Milray stated the case of Clementina 's divided 
mind, and her belief that she would take Hinkle in 
the end, together with the fear that she might take 
Gregory. " She 's very odd," Miss Milray concluded. 
"She puzzles me. Why did you ever send her to 
me?" 

Milray laughed. " I don 't know. I thought she 
would amuse you, and I thought it would be a pleas 
ure to her." 

They began to talk of some affairs of their own, 
from which Miss Milray returned to Clementina with 
the ache of an imperfectly satisfied intention. If she 
had meant to urge her brother to seek justice for the 
girl from Mrs. Lander, she was not so well pleased to 
have found justice done already. But the will had 
been duly signed and witnessed before the American 



 

vice-consul, and she must get what good she could 
out of an accomplished fact. It was at least a conso 
lation to know that it put an end to her sister-in-law 's 
patronage of the girl, and it would be interesting to 
see Mrs. Milray adapt her behavior to Clementina 's 
fortunes. She did not really dislike her sister-in-law 
enough to do her a wrong ; she was only willing that 
she should do herself a wrong. 

But one of the most disappointing things in all 
hostile operations is that you never can know what 
the enemy would be at ; and Mrs. Milray 's manoeuvres 
were sometimes dictated by such impulses that her 
strategy was peculiarly baffling. The thought of her 
past unkindness to Clementina may still have rankled 
in her, or she may simply have felt the need of out 
doing Miss Milray by an unapproachable benefaction. 
It is certain that when Baron Belsky came to Venice 
a few weeks after her own arrival, they began to pose 
at each other with reference to Clementina; she with 
a measure of consciousness, he with the singleness of 
a nature that was all pose. In his forbearance to win 
Clementina from Gregory he had enjoyed the dis 
tinction of an unique suffering ; and in allowing the 
fact to impart itself to Mrs. Milray, he bathed in the 
warmth of her flattering sympathy. Before she with 
drew this, as she must when she got tired of him, she 
learned from him where Gregory was ; for it seemed 
that Gregory had so far forgiven the past that they 
had again written to each other. 

During the fortnight of Belsky 's stay in Venice 
Mrs. Lander was much worse, and Clementina met him 



 

only once, very briefly. She felt that he had behaved 
like a very silly person, but that was all over now, and 
she had no wish to punish him for it. At the end of 
his fortnight he went northward into the Austrian 
Tyrol, and a few days later Gregory came down from 
the Dolomites to Venice. 

It was in his favor with Clementina that he yielded 
to the impulse he had to come directly to her ; and 
that he let her know with the first words that he had 
acted upon hopes given him through Belsky from 
Mrs. Milray. He owned that he doubted the author 
ity of either to give him these hopes, but he said he 
could not abandon them without a last effort to see 
her, and learn from her whether they were true or 
false. 

If she recognized the design of a magnificent repar 
ation in what Mrs. Milray had done, she did not give 
it much thought. Her mind was upon distant things 
as she followed Gregory 's explanation of his presence, 
and in the muse in which she listened she seemed 
hardly to know when he ceased speaking. 

" I know it must seem to take something for granted 
which I 've  no right to take for granted. I don 't be 
lieve you could think that I cared for anything but 
you, or at all for what Mrs. Lander has done for you." 

" Do you mean her leaving me her money ? " asked 
Clementina, with that boldness her sex enjoys con 
cerning matters of finance and affection. 

" Yes," said Gregory, blushing for her. " As far 
as I should ever have a right to care, I could wish 
there were no money. It could bring no blessing to 
our life. We could do no good with it ; nothing but 



 

the sacrifice of ourselves in poverty could be blessed 
to us." 

" That is what I thought, too," Clementina replied. 

" Oh, then you did think " 

" But afterwards," she added, " I changed my mind. 
If she wants to give me her money I shall take it." 

Gregory was blankly silent again. 

" I shouldn 't know how to refuse, and I don 't know 
as I should have any right to." Gregory shrank a 
little from her reyankeefied English, as well as from 
the apparent cynicism of her speech ; but he shrank 
in silence still. She startled him by asking with a 
kindness that was almost tenderness, " Mr. Gregory, 
how do you think anything has changed ? " 

" Changed ? " 

" You know how it was when you went away from 
Florence. Do you think differently now ? I don t. 
I don 't think I ought to do something for you, and 
pretend that I was doing it for religion. I don 't be 
lieve the way you do ; and I know I neva shall. Do 
you want me to go with you, afta that ? Do you want 
me, in spite of my saying that I can neva help you in 
your wo k because I believe in it ? " 

" But if you believe in me " 

She shook her head compassionately. "You know 
we ahgued that out before. We are just whe e we 
were. I am sorry. Nobody had any right to tell 
you to come he e. But I am glad you came." She 
saw the hope that lighted up his face, but she went on 
unrelentingly. " I think we had betta be free." 

"Free?" 



 

" Yes, from eacli other. I don 't know how you 
have felt, but I have not felt free. It has seemed to 
me that I promised you something. If I did, I want 
to take my promise back and be free." 

Her frankness appealed to his own. "You are 
free. I never held you bound to me in my fondest 
hopes. You have always done right." 

" I have tried to. And I am not going to let you 
go away thinking that the reason I said is the only 
reason. It isn t. I wish to be free because there is 
some one else, now." It was hard to tell him this, but 
she knew that she must not do less ; and the train 
that carried him from Venice that night bore a letter 
from her to Hinkle. 



XXXIII. 

CLEMENTINA told Miss Milray what had happened, 
but with Mrs. Milray the girl left the sudden depart 
ure of Gregory to account for itself. 

They all went a week later, and Mrs. Milray having 
now done her whole duty to Clementina had the 
easiest mind concerning her. Miss Milray felt that 
she was leaving her to greater trials than ever with 
Mrs. Lander; but since there was nothing else, she 
submitted, as people always do with the trials of 
others, and when she was once away she began to 
forget her. 

By this time, however, it was really better for her. 
With no one to suspect of tampering with her allegiance, Mrs. Lander returned to her former fondness 
for the girl, and they were more peaceful if not hap 
pier together again. They had long talks, such as
