atrocious day. ' Go straight over and put it 
to her : let her choose, freely, her own self. ' 





So I do, old girl I put it to you. Can 
you choose freely ? " 

This long address, slowly and brokenly 
uttered, with fidgets and falterings, with 
lapses and recoveries, with a mottled face 
and embarrassed but supplicating eyes, 
reached the child from a quarter so close 
that after the shock of the first sharpness 
she could see, intensely, its direction and 
follow it from point to point; all the more 
that it came back to the point at which it 
had started. There was a word that had 
hummed all through it. " Do you call it a 
'sacrifice?'" 

" Of Mrs. Wix? I 'll call it whatever you 
call it. I won't funk it I have n't, have I ? 
I 'll face it in all its baseness. Does it 
strike you it is base for me to get you well 
away from her, to smuggle you off here into 
a corner and bribe you with sophistries and 
buttered rolls to betray her ? " 

"To betray her?" 

"Well to part with her." 

Maisie let the question wait ; the concrete 
image it presented was the most vivid side 
of it. "If I part with her where will 
she go ? " 

"Back to London." 





" But I mean what will she do ? " 

"Oh, as for that, I won't pretend I know. 
I don't. We all have our difficulties." 

That, to Maisie, was at this moment more 
striking than it had ever been. " Then who 
will teach me? " 

Sir Claude laughed out. "What Mrs. 
Wix teaches?" 

Maisie smiled dimly; she saw what he 
meant. "It isn't very, very much." 

"It's so very, very little," he rejoined, 
"that that 's a thing we 've positively to con- 
sider. We probably should n't give you 
another governess. To begin with, we 
shouldn't be able to get one not of the 
only kind that would do. It wouldn't do 
the kind that would to " he queerly enough 
explained. " I mean they would n't stay 
heigh-ho! We 'd do you ourselves. Partic- 
ularly me. You see I can now; I haven't 
got to mind what I used to. I won't fight 
shy as I did she can show out with me. 
Our relation, all round, is more regular. " 

It seemed wonderfully regular, the way 
he put it; yet none the less, while she 
looked at it as judiciously as she could, the 
picture it made persisted somehow in being 
a combination quite distinct an old woman 





and a little girl seated in deep silence on a 
battered old bench by the rampart of the 
haiLte mile. It was just at that hour yester- 
day; they were hand in hand; they had 
melted together. "I don't think you yet 
understand how she clings to you," Maisie 
said at last. 

"I do I do. But for all that !" And 
he gave, turning in his conscious exposure, 
an oppressed, impatient sigh; the sigh, even 
his companion could recognize, of the man 
naturally accustomed to that argument, the 
man who wanted thoroughly to be reasonable, 
but who, if really he had to mind so many 
things, would be always impossibly ham- 
pered. What it came to indeed was that he 
understood quite perfectly. If Mrs. Wix 
clung it was all the more reason for shaking 
Mrs. Wix off. 

This vision of what she had brought him 
to occupied our young lady while, to ask 
what he owed, he called the waiter and put 
down a gold piece that the man carried off 
for change. Sir Claude looked after him, 
then went on : " How could a woman have 
less to reproach a fellow with? I mean as 
regards herself." 

Maisie entertained the question. "Yes, 





How could she have less ? So why are you 
so sure she 'll go?" 

"Surely you heard why you heard her 
come out three nights ago ? How can she do 
anything but go after what she then said ? 
I 've done what she warned me of she was 
absolutely right. So here we are. Her 
liking Mrs. Beale, as you call it, now, is a 
motive sufficient with other things to make 
her, for your sake, stay on without me; it 's 
not a motive sufficient to make her, even for 
yours, stay on with me swallow, in short, 
what she can't swallow. And when you 
say she 's as fond of me as you are I think I 
can, if that 's the case, challenge you a little 
on it. Would you, only with those two, stay 
on without me ? " The' waiter came back 
with the change, and that gave her, under 
this appeal, a moment's respite. But when 
he had retreated again with the "tip" gath- 
ered in with graceful thanks, on a subtle 
hint from Sir Claude's forefinger, the latter 
while he pocketed the money followed the 
appeal up. "Would you let her make you 
live with Mrs. Beale? " 

"Without you? Never," Maisie then an- 
swered. "Never," she said again. 

It made him quite triumph, and she was 





indeed herself shaken by the mere sound of 
it. "So you see you 're not, like her," he 
exclaimed, " so ready to give me away ! " 
Then he came back to his original question. 
" Can you choose? I mean can you settle 
it, by a word, yourself? Will you stay on 
with us without her? " 

Now in truth she felt the coldness of her 
terror, and it Seemed to her that suddenly 
she knew, as she knew it about Sir Claude, 
what she was afraid of. She was afraid of 
herself. She looked at him in such a way 
that it brought, she could see, wonder into 
his face, a wonder held in check, however, 
by his frank pretension to play fair with 
her, not to use advantages, not to hurry nor 
hustle her only to put her chance clearly 
and kindly before her. "May I think?" 
she finally asked. 

" Certainly, certainly. But how long ? " 

"Oh, only a little while," she said 
meekly. 

He had for a moment the air of wishing 
to look at it as if it were the most cheerful 
prospect in the world. "But what shall we 
do while you're thinking?" He spoke as 
if thought were compatible with almost any 
distraction. 





There was but one thing Maisie wished to 
do, and after an instant she expressed it. 
" Have we got to go back to the hotel ? " 

" Do you want to ? " 

"Oh no." 

"There's not the least necessity for it." 
He bent his eyes on his watch ; his face was 
now very grave. "We can do anything else 
in the world." He looked at her again al- 
most as if he were on the point of saying that 
they might for instance start off for Paris. 
But even while she wondered if that were 
not coming he had a sudden drop. "We 
can take a walk." 

She was all ready, but he sat there as if 
he had still something more to say. This 
too, however, didn't come; so she herself 
spoke. " I think I should like to see Mrs. 
Wix first." 

" Before you decide ? All right all 
right." He had put on his hat, but he had 
still to light a cigarette. He smoked a 
minute, with his head thrown back, looking 
at the ceiling; then he said: "There 's one 
thing to remember I 've a right to impress 
it on you : we stand absolutely in the place 
of your parents. It's their defection, their 
extraordinary baseness, that has made our 





responsibility. Never was a young person 
more directly committed and confided." He 
appeared to say this over, at the ceiling, 
through his smoke, a little for his own illu- 
mination. It carried him, after a pause, 
somewhat further. "Though, I admit, it 
was to each of us separately." 

He gave her so, at that moment and in 
that attitude, the sense of wanting, as it 
were, to be on her side on the side of what 
would be in every way most right and wise 
and charming for her that she felt a sudden 
desire to show herself as not less delicate 
and magnanimous, not less solicitous for his 
own interests. What were these but that of 
the "regularity" he had just before spoken 
of? " It was to each of you separately," she 
accordingly, with much earnestness, re- 
marked ; " but don't you remember ? I 
brought you together." 

He jumped up with a delighted laugh. 
"You brought us together, you brought us 
together. Come ! " 

XXXI 

SHE remained out with him for a time of 
which she could take no measure save that 





it was too short for what she wished to make 
of it an interval, a barrier, indefinite, 
insurmountable. They walked about, they 
dawdled, they looked in shop-windows ; they 
did all the old things exactly as if to try to 
get back all the old safety, to get something 
out of them that they had always got before. 
This had come before, whatever it was, 
without their trying, and nothing came now 
but the intenser consciousness of their quest 
and their subterfuge. The strangest thing 
of all was what had really happened to the 
old safety. What had really happened was 
that Sir Claude was "free" and that Mrs. 
Beale was "free," and yet that the new 
medium was somehow still more oppressive 
than the old. She could feel that Sir Claude 
concurred with her in the sense that the 
oppression would be worst at the inn, where, 
till something should be settled, they would 
feel the want of something of what could 
they call it but a footing? The question of 
the settlement loomed larger to her now ; it 
depended, she had learned, so completely 
on herself. Her choice, as her friend had 
called it, was there before her like an impos- 
sible sum on a slate, a sum that, in spite of 
her plea for consideration, she simply got 





off from doing while she walked about with 
him. She must see Mrs. Wix before she 
could do her sum ; therefore the longer 
before she saw her the more distant would 
be the ordeal. She met at present no de- 
mand whatever of her obligation; she 
simply plunged, to avoid it, deeper into the 
company of Sir Claude. She saw nothing 
that she had seen hitherto no touch in the 
foreign picture that had at first been always 
before her. The only touch was that of Sir 
Claude's hand, and to feel her own in it was 
her mute resistance to time. She went 
about as sightlessly as if he had been leading 
her blindfold. If they were afraid of them- 
selves it was themselves they would find at 
the inn. She was certain now that what 
awaited them there would be to lunch with 
Mrs. Beale. All her instinct was to avoid 
that, to draw out their walk, to find pretexts, 
to take him down upon the sands, to take 
him to the end of the pier. He said not 
another word to her about what they had 
talked of at breakfast, and she had a dim 
vision of how his way of not letting her see 
that he was waiting for anything from her 
would make any one who should know of it, 
would make Mrs. Wix for instance, think 





him more than ever a gentleman. It was 
true that once or twice, on the jetty, on the 
sands, he looked at her for an instant with 
eyes that seemed to propose to her to come 
straight off with him to Paris. That, how- 
ever, was not to give her a nudge about her 
responsibility. He evidently wanted to pro- 
crastinate quite as much as she he was 
not a bit more in a hurry to get back to the 
others. Maisie herself, at this moment, 
could be secretly merciless to Mrs. Wix 
to the extent at any rate of not caring if 
her continued disappearance did make that 
lady begin to worry about what had become 
of her, even begin to wonder perhaps if 
the truants had n't found their remedy. Her 
want of mercy to Mrs. Beale, indeed, was at 
least as great; for Mrs. Beale' s worry and 
wonder would be as much greater as the 
object to which they were directed. When 
at last Sir Claude, at the far end of \heplage, 
which they had already, in the many -colored 
crowd, once traversed, suddenly, with a 
look at his watch, remarked that it was time, 
not to get back to the table c kote, but to get 
over to the station and meet the Paris papers 
when he did this she found herself think- 
ing, quite with intensity, what Mrs. Beale 





and Mrs. Wix would say. On the way over 
to the station she had even a mental picture 
of the stepfather and the pupil established 
in a little place in the south while the 
governess and the stepmother, in a little 
place in the north, remained linked by a 
community of blankness and by the endless 
theme of intercourse it would afford. The 
Paris papers had come in, and her compan- 
ion, with a strange extravagance, bought no 
less of them than nine: it took up time 
while they hovered at the bookstall on the 
restless platform, where the little volumes 
in a row were all yellow and pink and one 
of her favorite old women, in one of her 
favorite old caps, absolutely wheedled him 
into the purchase of three. They had thus 
so much to carry home that it would have 
seemed simpler, with such a provision for 
a nice straight journey through France, just 
to "nip," as she phrased it to herself, into 
the coupe of the train that, a little further 
along, stood waiting to start. She asked 
Sir Claude where it was going. 

"To Paris. Fancy!" 

She could fancy well enough. They stood 
there and smiled, he with all the newspapers 
under his arm and she with the three books, 





one yellow and two pink. He had told her 
the pink were for herself and the yellow one 
for Mrs. Beale, implying, in an interesting 
way, that these were the vivid divisions, in 
France, of literature for the young and for 
the old. She knew that they looked exactly 
as if they were going to get into the train, 
and she presently brought out to her com- 
panion : " I wish we could go. Won't you 
take me ? " 

He continued to smile. "Would you 
really come ? " 

"Oh yes, oh yes! Try!" 

"Do you want me to take our tickets?" 

"Yes, take them." 

" Without any luggage ? " 

She showed their two armfuls, smiling at 
him as he smiled at her, but so conscious of 
being more frightened than she had ever 
been in her life, that she seemed to catch 
all her whiteness as in a glass. Then she 
knew that what she saw was Sir Claude's 
whiteness ; he was as frightened as herself. 
"Haven't we got plenty?" she asked. 
" Take the tickets have n't you time ? 
When does the train go ? " 

Sir Claude turned to a porter. "When 
does the train go ? " 





The man looked up at the station clock. 
"In two minutes. Monsieur est plact ? " 

" Pas encore. " 

" Vous ri avez qtie le temps." Then, after 
a look at Maisie, "Monsieur veut-il que je 
les prenne? " the man inquired. 

Sir Claude turned back to her. " Veux-tu 
bien qu'il en prenne f " 

It was the most extraordinary thing in the 
world : in the intensity of her excitement 
she not only, by illumination, understood 
all their French, but fell into it with an 
active perfection. She addressed herself 
straight to the porter. " Prenny, prenny. 
Oh, prenny!" 

"Ah, si mademoiselle le veut " He 
waited there for the money. 

But Sir Claude only stared stared at her 
with his pale face. "You have chosen, 
then? You'll let her go?" 

Maisie carried her eyes wistfully to the 
train, where, amid cries of "En voiture, 
en voiture!" heads were at windows and 
doors were banging loud. The porter 
was pressing. " Oh, vous rf avez plus le 
temps ! " 

" It 's going it 's going ! " cried Maisie. 

They watched it move, they watched it 





start; then the man went his way with a 
shrug. " It 's gone ! " Sir Claude said. 

Maisie crept some distance up the plat- 
form ; she stood there with her back to her 
companion, following it with her eyes, keep- 
ing down tears, nursing her pink and yellow 
books. She had had a real fright, but had 
fallen back to earth. The odd thing was 
that in her fall her fear too had been dashed 
down and broken. It was gone. She looked 
round at last, from where she had paused, 
at Sir Claude's, and then she saw that his 
was not. It sat there with him on the bench 
to which, against the wall of the station, he 
had retreated and where, leaning back and, 
as she thought, very queer, he still waited. 
She came down to him, and he continued to 
offer his ineffectual intention of pleasantry. 
" Yes, I 've chosen," she said to him. " I 'll 
let her go if you if you " 

She faltered; he quickly took her up. 
"If I, if I?" 

" If you 'll give up Mrs. Beale." 

" Oh ! " he exclaimed ; on which she saw 
how much, how hopelessly he was afraid. 
She had supposed at the cafe that it was of 
his rebellion, of his gathering motive; but 
how could that be when his temptations 





that temptation for instance of the train they 
had just lost were, after all, so small ? 
Mrs. Wix was right. He was afraid of his 
weakness of his weakness. 

She could not have told you afterwards 
how they got back to the inn: she could 
only have told you that even from this point 
they had not gone straight, but once more 
had wandered and loitered and, in the course 
of it, had found themselves on the edge of 
the quay, where still, apparently, with 
half an hour to spare the boat prepared 
for Folkestone was drawn up. Here they 
hovered as they had done at the station ; here 
they exchanged silences again, but only 
exchanged silences. There were punctual 
people on the deck, choosing places, taking 
the best; some of them already contented, 
all established and shawled, facing to Eng- 
land and attended by the steward, who, con- 
fined on such a day to the lighter offices, 
tucked up the ladies' feet or opened bottles 
with a pop. They looked down at these 
things without a word ; they even picked out 
a good place for two that was left in the lee 
of a lifeboat; and if they lingered rather 
stupidly, neither deciding to go aboard nor 
deciding to come away, it was, quite as 





much as she, Sir Claude who would n't move. 
It was Sir Claude who cultivated the su- 
preme stillness by which she knew best what 
he meant. He simply meant that he knew 
all she herself meant. But there was no 
pretence of pleasantry now ; their faces were 
grave and tired. When at last they lounged 
off it was as if his fear, his fear of his weak- 
ness, leaned upon her hard while they fol- 
lowed the harbor. In the hall of the hotel, 
as they passed in, she saw a battered old box 
that she recognized, an ancient receptacle 
with dangling labels that she knew and a 
big painted W, lately done over and in- 
tensely personal, that seemed to stare at 
her with a recognition and even with some 
suspicion of its own. Sir Claude caught it 
too, and there was agitation for both of them 
in the sight of this object on the move. 
Was Mrs. Wix going, and was the responsi- 
bility of giving her up lifted, at a touch, 
from her pupil? Her pupil and her pupil's 
companion, transfixed a moment, held, in 
the presence of the omen, communication 
more intense than in the presence either of 
the Paris train or of the Channel steamer; 
then, and still without a word, they went 
straight upstairs. There, however, on the 





landing, out of sight of the people below, 
they collapsed so that they had to sink down 
together for support: they simply seated 
themselves on the uppermost step while Sir 
Claude grasped the hand of his stepdaughter 
with a pressure that at another moment 
would probably have made her squeal. 
Their books and papers were all scattered. 
" She thinks you 've given her up ! " 

" Then I must see her I must see her ! " 
Maisie said.
