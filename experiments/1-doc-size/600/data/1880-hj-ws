ity of reasoning. "I expect nothing," he said to 
himself ; " so that, if she gives me a surprise, it will 
be all clear gain. If she doesn't, it will be no loss." 
This was about the time Catherine had reached her 
eighteenth year ; so that it will be seen her father 
had not been precipitate. At this time she seemed 
not only incapable of giving surprises ; it was al- 
most a question whether she could have received 
one she was so quiet and irresponsive. People 
who expressed themselves roughly called her stolid. 
But she was irresponsive because she was shy, un- 
comfortably, painfully shy. This was not always 
understood, and she sometimes produced an impression
of insensibility. In reality, she was the softest 
creature in the world. 



III. 

As a child she had promised to be tall ; but when 
she was sixteen she ceased to grow, and her stature, 
like most other points in her composition, was not 
unusual. She was strong, however, and properly 
made, and, fortunately, her health was excellent. 
It has been noted that the Doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered for his philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suf- 
fering person. Her appearance of health constituted 
her principal claim to beauty ; and her clear, fresh 
complexion, in which white and red were very equally distributed, was, indeed, an excellent thing to see. 
Her eye was small and quiet, her features were 
rather thick, her tresses brown and smooth. A dull, 
plain girl she was called by rigorous critics a quiet, 
lady-like girl, by those of the more imaginative sort ; 
but by neither class was she very elaborately discussed. When it had been duly impressed upon her 
that she was a young lady it was a good while before she could believe it she suddenly developed 
a lively taste for dress: a lively taste is quite the 
expression to use. I feel as if I ought to write it 
very small, her judgment in this matter was by no 
means infallible ; it was liable to confusions and 
embarrassments. Her great indulgence of it was 
really the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to 





manifest itself; she sought to be eloquent in her 
garments, and to make up for her diffidence of 
speech by a fine frankness of costume. But if she 
expressed herself in her clothes, it is certain that 
people were not to blame for not thinking her a 
witty person. It must be added that, though she 
had the expectation of a fortune Doctor Sloper for 
a long time had been making twenty thousand dol- 
lars a year by his profession, and laying aside the 
half of it the amount of money at her disposal was 
not greater than the allowance made to many poorer 
girls. In those days, in New York, there were still 
a few altar-fires flickering in the temple of Repub- 
lican simplicity, and Doctor Sloper would have been 
glad to see his daughter present herself, with a clas- 
sic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith. It made 
him fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child 
of his should be both ugly and overdressed. For 
himself, he was fond of the good things of life, and 
he made a considerable use of them; but he had a 
dread of vulgarity, and even a theory that it was increasing in the society that surrounded him. More- 
over, the standard of luxury in the United States 
thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as 
at present, and Catherine's clever father took the 
old-fashioned view of the education of young per- 
sons. He had no particular theory on the subject ; 
it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of self-defence to have a collection of theories. It simply 
appeared to him proper and reasonable that a well- 
bred young woman should not carry half her fortune 
on her back. Catherine's back was a broad one, 
and would have carried a good deal; but to the 





weight of the paternal displeasure she never vent 
ured to expose it, and our heroine was twenty years 
old before she treated herself, for evening wear, to 
a red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe ; though 
this was an article which, for many years, she had 
coveted in secret. It made her look, when she 
sported it, like a woman of thirty ; but oddly enough, 
in spite of her taste for fine clothes, she had not a 
grain of coquetry, and her anxiety when she put 
them on was as to whether they, and not she, would 
look well. It is a point on which history has not 
been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable; it 
was in the royal raiment just mentioned that she 
presented herself at a little entertainment given by 
her aunt, Mrs. Almond. The girl was at this time 
in her twenty -first year, and Mrs. Almond's party 
was the beginning of something very important. 

Some three or four years before this, Doctor 
Sloper had moved his household gods up town, as 
they say in New York. He had been living ever 
since his marriage in an edifice of red brick, with 
granite copings and an enormous fan-light over the 
door, standing in a street within five minutes' walk 
of the City Hall, which saw its best days (from the 
social point of view) about 1820. After this, the 
tide of fashion began to set steadily northward, as, 
indeed, in New York, thanks to the narrow channel 
in which it flows, it is obliged to do, and the great 
hum of traffic rolled farther to the right and left of 
Broadway. By the time the Doctor changed his 
residence, the murmur of trade had become a mighty 
uproar, which was music in the ears of all good citizens
interested in the commercial development, as 





they delighted to call it, of their fortunate isle. Doc- 
tor Sloper's interest in this phenomenon was only in- 
direct though, seeing that, as the years went on, 
half his patients came to be overworked men of busi- 
ness, it might have been more immediate and when 
most of his neighbors' dwellings (also ornamented 
with granite copings and large fan-lights) had been 
converted into offices, warehouses, and shipping agen- 
cies, and otherwise applied to the base uses of com- 
merce, he determined to look out for a quieter home. 
The ideal of quiet and of genteel retirement, in 
1835, was found in Washington Square, where the 
Doctor built himself a handsome, modern, wide- 
fronted house, with a big balcony before the draw- 
ing-room windows, and a flight of white marble steps 
ascending to a portal which was also faced with 
white marble. This structure, and many of its 
neighbors, which it exactly resembled, were sup- 
posed, forty years ago, to embody the last results of 
architectural science, and they remain to this day 
very solid and honorable dwellings. In front of 
them was the square, containing a considerable 
quantity of inexpensive vegetation, enclosed by a 
wooden paling, which increased its rural and acces- 
sible appearance; and round the corner was the 
more august precinct of the Fifth Avenue, taking 
its origin at this point with a spacious and confident 
air which already marked it for high destinies. I 
know not whether it is owing to the tenderness of 
early associations, but this portion of New York ap- 
pears to many persons the most delectable. It has 
a kind of established repose which is not of frequent 
occurrence in other quarters of the long, shrill city ; 
it has a riper, richer, more honorable look than any 
of the upper ramifications of the great longitudinal 
thoroughfare the look of having had something of 
a social history. It was here, as you might have 
been informed on good authority, that you had come 
into a world which appeared to offer a variety of 
sources of interest; it was here that your grand- 
mother lived, in venerable solitude, and dispensed 
a hospitality which commended itself alike to the 
infant imagination and the infant palate; it was 
here that you took your first walks abroad, following 
the nursery-maid with unequal step, and sniffing up 
the strange odor of the ailanthus-trees which at that 
time formed the principal umbrage of the Square, 
and diffused an aroma that you were not yet critical 
enough to dislike as it deserved ; it was here, final- 
ly, that your first school, kept by a broad-bosomed, 
broad-based old lady with a ferule, who was always 
having tea in a blue cup, with a saucer that didn't 
match, enlarged the circle both of your observations 
and your sensations. It was here, at any rate, that 
my heroine spent many years of her life ; which is 
my excuse for this topographical parenthesis. 

Mrs. Almond lived much farther up town, in an 
embryonic street, with a high number a region 
where the extension of the city began to assume a 
theoretic air, where poplars grew beside the pave- 
ment (when there was one), and mingled their shade 
with the steep roofs of desultory Dutch houses, and 
where pigs and chickens disported themselves in the 
gutter. These elements of rural picturesqueness 
have now wholly departed from New York street 
scenery; but they were to be found within the 
memory of middle-aged persons in quarters which 
now would blush to be reminded of them. Cathe- 
rine had a great many cousins, and with her Aunt 
Almond's children, who ended by being nine in 
number, she lived on terms of considerable intimacy. 
When she was younger they had been rather afraid 
of her ; she was believed, as the phrase is, to be high- 
ly educated, and a person who lived in the intimacy 
of their Aunt Penniman had something of reflect- 
ed grandeur. Mrs. Penniman, among the little Al- 
monds, was an object of more admiration than sym- 
pathy. Her manners were strange and formidable, 
and her mourning robes she dressed in black for 
twenty years after her husband's death, and then sud- 
denly appeared, one morning, with pink roses in her 
cap were complicated in odd, unexpected places 
with buckles, bugles, and pins, which discouraged 
familiarity. She took children too hard, both for 
good and for evil, and had an oppressive air of ex- 
pecting subtle things of them ; so that going to see 
her was a good deal like being taken to church and 
made to sit in a front pew. It was discovered after 
awhile, however, that Aunt Penniman was but an ac- 
cident in Catherine's existence, and not a part of its 
essence, and that when the girl came to spend a Sat- 
urday with her cousins, she was available for " fol- 
low -my -master," and even for leap-frog. On this 
basis an understanding was easily arrived at, and for 
several years Catherine fraternized with her young 
kinsmen. I say young kinsmen, because seven of 
the little Almonds were boys, and Catherine had a 
preference for those games which are most conven- 
iently played in trousers. By degrees, however, the 





little Almonds' trousers began to lengthen, and the 
wearers to disperse and settle themselves in life. 
The elder children were older than Catherine, and 
the boys were sent to college or placed in counting- 
rooms. Of the girls, one married very punctually, 
and the other as punctually became engaged. It 
was to celebrate this latter event that Mrs. Almond 
gave the little party I have mentioned. Her daugh- 
ter was to marry a stout young stock-broker, a boy 
of twenty : it was thought a very good thing. 



IY. 

MRS. PENNIMAN, with more buckles and bangles 
than ever, came, of course, to the entertainment, ac- 
companied by her niece ; the Doctor, too, had prom- 
ised to look in later in the evening. There was to 
be a good deal of dancing, and before it had gone 
very far Marian Almond came up to Catherine, in 
company with a tall young man. She introduced 
the young man as a person who had a great desire 
to make our heroine's acquaintance, and as a cousin 
of Arthur Townsend, her own intended. 

Marian Almond was a pretty little person of sev- 
enteen, with a very small figure and a very big sash, 
to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had 
nothing to add. She already had all the airs of a 
hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan, say- 
ing that with so many people to attend to she should 
have no time to dance. She made a long speech 
about Mr. Townsend's cousin, to whom she administered
a tap with her fan before turning away to 
other cares. Catherine had not understood all that 
she said ; her attention was given to enjoying Ma- 
rian's ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to look- 
ing at the young man, who was remarkably hand- 
some. She had succeeded, however, as she often 
failed to do when people were presented to her, in 
catching his name, which appeared to be the same 
as that of Marian's little stock-broker. Catherine 
was always agitated by an introduction ; it seemed 
a difficult moment, and she wondered that some peo- 
ple her new acquaintance at this moment, for in- 
stance should mind it so little. She wondered 
what she ought to say, and what would be the con- 
sequences of her saying nothing. The consequences 
at present were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leav- 
ing her no time for embarrassment, began to talk to 
her with an easy smile, as if he had known her for 
a year. 

"What a delightful party! What a charming 
house ! What an interesting family ! What a pret- 
ty girl your cousin is !" 

These observations, in themselves of no great pro- 
fundity, Mr. Townsend seemed to offer for what they 
were worth, and as a contribution to an acquaintance. 
He looked straight into Catherine's eyes. She an- 
swered nothing; she only listened, and looked at 
him ; and he, as if he expected no particular reply, 
went on to say many other things in the same com- 
fortable and natural manner. Catherine, though 
she felt tongue-tied, was conscious of no embarrass- 
ment ; it seemed proper that he should talk, and that 
she should simply look at him. What made it natural
was that he was so handsome, or, rather, as she 
phrased it to herself, so beautiful. The music had 
been silent for awhile, but it suddenly began again ; 
and then he asked her, with a deeper, intenser smile, 
if she would do him the honor of dancing with him. 
Even to this inquiry she gave no audible assent ; she 
simply let him put his arm round her waist as she 
did so, it occurred to her more vividly than it had 
ever done before that this was a singular place for a 
gentleman's arm to be and in a moment he was 
guiding her round the room in the harmonious rota- 
tion of the polka. When they paused, she felt that 
she was red ; and then, for some moments, she stop- 
ped looking at him. She fanned herself, and looked 
at the flowers that were painted on her fan. He 
asked her if she would begin again, and she hesitated 
to answer, still looking at the flowers. 

" Does it make you dizzy ?" he asked, in a tone of 
great kindness. 

Then Catherine looked up at him ; he was cer- 
tainly beautiful, and not at all red. " Yes," she said ; 
she hardly knew why, for dancing had never made 
her dizzy. 

" Ah, well, in that case," said Mr. Townsend, " we 
will sit still and talk. I will find a good place to sit." 

He found a good place a charming place ; a little 
sofa that seemed meant only for two persons. The 
rooms by this time were very full ; the dancers in- 
creased in number, and people stood close in front 
of them, turning their backs, so that Catherine and 
her companion seemed secluded and unobserved. 
" We will talk," the young man had said ; but he still 
did all the talking. Catherine leaned back in her 
place, with her eyes fixed upon him, smiling, and 
thinking him very clever. He had features like 
young men in pictures; Catherine had never seen 
such features so delicate, so chiselled and finished 
among the young New Yorkers whom she passed in 
the streets and met at dancing-parties. He was tall 
and slim, but he looked extremely strong. Cathe- 
rine thought he looked like a statue. But a statue 
would not talk like that, and, above all, would not 
have eyes of so rare a color. He had never been at 
Mrs. Almond's before ; he felt very much like a 
stranger ; and it was very kind of Catherine to take 
pity on him. He was Arthur Townsend's cousin 
not very near ; several times removed and Arthur 
had brought him to present him to the family. In 
fact, he was a great stranger in 'New York. It was 
his native place ; but he had not been there for many 
years. He had been knocking about the world, and 
living in queer corners; he had only come back a 
month or two before. New York was very pleas- 
ant, only he felt lonely. 

" You see, people forget you," he said, smiling at 
Catherine with his delightful gaze, while he leaned 
forward obliquely, turning toward her, with his el- 
bows on his knees. 

It seemed to Catherine that no one who had once 
seen him would ever forget him; but though she 
made this reflection she kept it to herself, almost as 
you would keep something precious. 

They sat there for some time. He was very amus- 
ing. He asked her about the people that were near 
them ; he tried to guess who some of them were, 
and he made the most laughable mistakes. He criticised 
them very freely, in a positive, off-hand way. 
Catherine had never heard any one especially any 
young man talk just like that. It was the way a 
young man might talk in a novel ; or, better still, in 
a play, on the stage, close before the foot-lights, look- 
ing at the audience, and with every one looking at 
him, so that you wondered at his presence of mind. 
And yet Mr. Townsend was not like an actor; he 
seemed so sincere, so natural. This was very inter- 
esting ; but in the midst of it Marian Almond came 
pushing through the crowd, with a little ironical cry, 
when she found these young people still together, 
which made every one turn round, and cost Cathe- 
rine a conscious blush. Marian broke up their talk, 
and told Mr. Townsend whom she treated as if she 
were already married, and he had become her cousin 
to run away to her mother, who had been wishing 
for the last half hour to introduce him to Mr. Al- 
mond. 

"We shall meet again," he said to Catherine as 
he left her, and Catherine thought it a very original 
speech. 

Her cousin took her by the arm, and made her 
walk about. " I needn't ask you what you think of 
Morris," the young girl exclaimed. 

" Is that his name ?" 

" I don't ask you what you think of his name, but 
what you think of himself," said Marian. 

" Oh, nothing particular," Catherine answered, dis- 
sembling for the first time in her life. 

" I have half a mind to tell him that !" cried Ma- 
rian. " It will do him good ; he's so terribly con- 
ceited." 
" Conceited ?" said Catherine, staring. 

" So Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him." 

" Oh, don't tell him !" Catherine murmured, im- 
ploringly. 

" Don't tell him he's conceited ! I have told him 
so a dozen times." 

At this profession of audacity Catherine looked 
down at her little companion in amazement. She 
supposed it was because Marian was going to be 
married that she took so much on herself ; but she 
wondered too, whether, when she herself should be- 
come engaged, such exploits would be expected of 
her. 

Half an hour later she saw her aunt Penniman 
sitting in the embrasure of a window, with her head 
a little on one side, and her gold eye-glass raised to 
her eyes, which were wandering about the room. In 
front of her was a gentleman, bending forward a 
little, with his back turned to Catherine. She knew 
his back immediately, though she had never seen it ; 
for when he left her, at Marian's instigation, he had 
retreated in the best order, without turning round. 
Morris Townsend the name had already become 
very familiar to her, as if some one had been re- 
peating it in her ear for the last half hour Morris 
Townsend was giving his impressions of the com- 
pany to her aunt, as he had done to herself ; he was 
saying clever things, and Mrs. Penniman was smiling, 
as if she approved of them. As soon as Catherine 
had perceived this she moved away ; she would not 
have liked him to turn round and see her. But it 
gave her pleasure the whole thing. That he should 
talk with Mrs. Penniman, with whom she lived and 





whom she saw and talked with every day that 
seemed to keep him near her, and to make him 
even easier to contemplate than if she herself had 
been the object of his civilities ; and that Aunt La- 
vinia should like him, should not be shocked or star- 
tled by what he said, this also appeared to the girl a 
personal gain ; for Aunt Lavinia's standard was ex- 
tremely high, plan ted as it was over the grave of her 
late husband, in which, as she had convinced every 
one, the very genius of conversation was buried. 
One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called them, 
invited our heroine to dance a quadrille, and for a 
quarter of an hour her feet at least were occupied. 
This time she was not dizzy; her head was very 
clear. Just when the dance was over, she found 
herself in the crowd face to face with her father. 
Doctor Sloper had usually a little smile, never a very 
big one, and with this little smile playing in his clear 
eyes and on his neatly-shaved lips, h looked at his 
daughter's crimson gown. 

" Is it possible that this magnificent person is my 
child ?" he said. 

You would have surprised him if you had told 
him so ; but it is a literal fact that he almost never 
addressed his daughter save in the ironical form. 
Whenever he addressed her he gave her pleasure ; 
but she had to cut her pleasure out of the piece, as 
it were. There were portions left over, light rem- 
nants and snippets of irony, which she never knew 
what to do with, which seemed too delicate for her 
own use ; and yet Catherine, lamenting the limita- 
tions of her understanding, felt that they were too 
valuable to waste, and had a belief that if they passed 
over her head they yet contributed to the general 
sum of human wisdom. 

" I am not magnificent," she said, mildly, wishing 
that she had put on another dress. 

"You are sumptuous, opulent, expensive," her 
father rejoined. "You look as if you had eighty 
thousand a year." 

" Well, so long as I haven't " said Catherine, il- 
logically. Her conception of her prospective wealth 
was as yet very indefinite. 

" So long as you haven't you shouldn't look as if 
you had. Have you enjoyed your party ?" 

Catherine hesitated a moment ; and then, looking 
away, "I am rather tired," she murmured. I have 
said that this entertainment was the beginning of 
something important for Catherine. For the sec- 
ond time in her life she made an indirect answer; 
and the beginning of a period of dissimulation is 
certainly a significant date. Catherine was not so 
easily tired as that. 

Nevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, 
she was as quiet as if fatigue had been her portion. 
Doctor Sloper's manner of addressing his sister La- 
vinia had a good deal of resemblance to the tone he 
had adopted toward Catherine. 

" Who was the young man that was making love 
to you ?" he presently asked. 

" Oh, my good brother !" murmured Mrs. Penniman, 
in deprecation. 

"He seemed uncommonly tender. Whenever I 
looked at you for half an hour, he had the most de- 
voted air." 

" The devotion was not to me," said Mrs. Penniman. 
"It was to Catherine; he talked to me of 
her." 

Catherine had been listening with all her ears. 
" Oh, Aunt Penniman !" she exclaimed, faintly. 

" He is very handsome ; he is very clever ; he ex- 
pressed himself with a great deal a great deal of 
felicity," her aunt went on. 

"He is in love with this regal creature, then?" 
the Doctor inquired, humorously. 

" Oh, father !" cried the girl, still more faintly, de- 
voutly thankful the carriage was dark. 

" I don't know that ; but he admired her dress." 

Catherine did not say to herself in the dark, " My 
dress only ?" Mrs. Penniman's announcement struck 
her by its richness, not by its meagreness. 

" You see," said her father, " he thinks you have 
eighty thousand a year." 

" I don't believe he thinks of that," said Mrs. Pen- 
niman ; " he is too refined." 

" He must be tremendously refined not to think 
of that !" 

"Well, he is!" Catherine exclaimed, before she 
knew it. 

" I thought you had gone to sleep," her father an- 
swered. " The hour has come !" he added to him- 
self. "Lavinia is going to get up a romance for 
Catherine. It's a shame to play such tricks on the 
girl. What is the gentleman's name ?" he went on, 
aloud. 

" I didn't catch it, and I didn't like to ask him. 
He asked to be introduced to me," said Mrs. Penni- 
man, with a certain grandeur ; " but you know how 
indistinctly Jefferson speaks." Jefferson was Mr. 





Almond. " Catherine, dear, what was the gentle- 
man's name ?" 

For a minute, if it had not been for the rumbling 
of the carriage, you might have heard a pin drop. 

"I don't know, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, 
very softly. And, with all his irony, her father be- 
lieved her. 



Y. 

HE learned what he had asked some three or four 
days later, after Morris Townsend, with his cousin, 
had called in Washington Square. Mrs. Penniman 
did not tell her brother, on the drive home, that she 
had intimated to this agreeable young man, whose 
name she did not know, that, with her niece, she 
should be very glad to see him ; but she was greatly 
pleased, and even a little flattered, when, late on a
