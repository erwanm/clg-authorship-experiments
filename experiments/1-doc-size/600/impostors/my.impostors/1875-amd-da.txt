He did not read the letter over a second time. He 
meant it to be cold, but he little dreamed how cruel it 
would seem to her. Then he enclosed the check, sealed 
it hurriedly, and placing it in a common envelope, di- 
rected the outer one to Mrs. Catherine Dawson. The 





 



errand boy could be sent with that and no suspicions 
awakened. Afterwards he took his car for WoocQea. 

It appeared to him sometimes that he could never 
cuter the dreary house again. This lovely summer 
evening, with its bland airs, made it tenfold more lone- 
some. What if he should shut it up and go away? 
That seemed like saying a resolute "no" to Dora, if 
fate should ever make the way clear for her to come 
back. But the silent dinners were insupportable. 

He had called on Edith again that day, and found 
her very sweet and gracious. Mrs. Lester, in talking 
over old times, had woke more than one tender cord 
in his heart* In spite of her weakness and foolishness, 
there were some redeeming virtues, and when he re- 
membered how she had been tyrannized over by her 
selfish, arbitrary husband, he was thankful to Edith 
for making her declining years pleasant. And he gath- 
ered on this day that Mrs. Merrivour's married life had 
not been a happy one. 

Mrs. Lester had begged him to tell over the improve- 
ments at Woodlea. 

"Of course, it is different from jour poor father's 
time, though I thought it a pleasant place then. Oh, 
I have spent many a happy day there i" 

"Yes, it is much altered, getting to be quite a town, 
indeed, with its long, straight avenues. After the 
ground became so valuable, I sold part, reserving just 
enough to keep neighbors at a proper distance ; and he 



gave a grave smile. " The bouse is little changed — a 
porch added here and there, but it always was roomy, 
you know." 

" And that makes me think — Edith, why noj consult 
Ralph about a place?" Mrs. Lester never had any 
self-dependence, and her husband's rigorous rule, that 
would have roused many a woman into rebellion, had 
only rendered her the more meek and deferential. 
' 'We were talking of going somewhere, Ralph, for dur- 
ing these warm days the city is dreadful, you know. 
Edith being in mourning and all that"— and Mrs. Les- 
ter sighed — " she has no taste for gayety, so we wanted 
some quiet country home, not too far from the city, in 
case she needed to come in on business, as Mr. Merri- 
vour's estate is not settled yet." 

"Yes," Tremaine returned, thoughtfully. "There 
are some pleasant places on Long Island. Do you 
want sea side, Edith?" 

"I hardly know," she said, hesitatingly, "unless 
mamma thinks sea air too strong for her. She has 
been accustomed to such a mild atmosphere." 

Mamma always understood from the tone, which side 
she was to espouse. Not that she was drilled in private, 
but she seemed t<Thave a quick perception of the course 
that would be most agreeable. 

"I should be a little afraid, my love. The night air 
is so damp here, in America." 

"Then somewhere on high land would be best. I 
will inquire." 




"In the fall, I think we shall take a furnished house," 
Mrs. MerriTOur went on. "We have had so much of 
hotel life, that a home of one's own would be a luxury. 
Indeed, I have quite a longing to be settled." 

Mr. "Premaine recalled this conversation now. Why 
not invite Edith and her mother to Woodlea until they 
could make.their arrangements? If Dora were home, 
such a matter would be subject to her approval, for he 
had honestly confessed this early passion. But she 
might never be here again. Perhaps, all things being 
considered, it would be well to ask them. It would 
restore to the house an air of life, and might prevent 
impertinent curiosity. It would keep him from brood- 
ing too much in solitude, and give the servants some- 
thing to do. So he summoned the housekeeper. 

"Mrs, Maybin," he said "the rooms on the north 
side are in order, I suppose?" 
' "Yes." She made a stately inclination of the head. 

"I have an aunt and cousin just arrived from 
Europe, whom I think I shall invite for a month or two." 

She bowed again— * but her eyes asked another 
question. 

"Mrs. Tremaine may not be home for — some time." 
He cleared his throat and tried to steady his voice, as 
well as to shake off the feeling of embarrassment. 
"Mrs. Maybin," he continued, " I feel that some ex- 
planation is due one so worthy, and so long trusted. 
There has been a difficulty between myself and Mrs. 



Tremaine — not anything like a quarrel, understand, 
but something that necessitates a separation at present. 
I do not wish the subject to be discussed in the kitchen 
or in the neighborhood. It will be sufficient to say 
that Mrs. Tremaine is away on a visit. I trust your 
good sense and discretion entirely." 

She was a good deal surprised — more at the con- 
fidence than the incident, for she knew very well that 
something quite unusual had occurred. 

" You will like the ladies, and find them very pleasant 
and quiet. Both are in mourning, and have met with . 
a recent sorrow. I suppose the house will be in readi- 
ness at any time ? " 

" Yes. You will not find your confidence misplaced, 
Mr. Tremaine. And I have too true a regard for you, 
to add to any trouble you may have, by allowing idle 
gossip in this house, at least." 

" Thank you, Mrs. Maybin." He wrung her hand 
warmly. 

As he sat alone afterward, he felt greatly relieved. 
If he could only get through the summer, or come to 
something final ! It was the suspense and doubt that 
wore him so horribly. Yet he was thankful that so 
little had been said about it, or that so few knew the 
facts of the case. * 

The next day he took his invitation to Mrs. Lester. 
She was delighted. Edith demurred a little. 

' ' Why ? " Ralph Tremaine asked, looking out of his 



honest ejes. " Since you are the only relatives Ihave, 
why should not my house he open to you? I want to 
keep this — unfortunate affair — " he stumbled a little 
over the words, " as quiet as possible until it is settled. 
I hate gossip and endless surmises, and I think that it 
will be better for me if you come, though, I do not wish 
to persuade you simply on that account. I can make 
it pleasant, since you will not care for society. " 

" Retirement would be my first consideration in any 
place," Edith 'answered. " How kind and thoughtful 
you are, Ralph." 

The woman he had once loved ! It crossed his mind 
every now and then as some turn or some word called 
back the old days. Since both of their lives had been 
marred, why should they not be friends, true and tender 
in a relative sense. He did not dream of any danger 
from her beauty or fascination — indeed, with Dora 
would go the last desire for love, and happiness such as 
love brings. 

The affair had tended to distract his mind a little 
from the subject he had brooded over so much. He 
wondered if Dora would answer his note, and waited 
several days in vain. Then he gathered the bonds and 
stocks in which her property had been invested, and 
placed them in the hands of a legal friend, subject to 
her disposal — making an announcement of this to her. 

Early in the ensuing week, Mrs. Lester and Mrs. 
Menivour went to Woodlea, 



Edith Merrivour accepted the turn of affairs with a 
strange feeling that she had much difficulty to subdue 
into calmness. She did not look forward to anything, 
but simply realized that she was here, and must be, in 
some sense, Ralph Tremaine's companion. In the 
course of time, he would be free again. 

That Dora loved her husband, she could not believe. 
She set her down for a girl of little soul and no princi- 
ple — and pitied Ralph sincerely that he should have 
been captivated b}' her arts. Looking at her portrait, 
she decided that Dora could not have been beautiful, 
consequently it seemed as if she must have appealed to 
some weakuess in his nature. That it might have 
been the virtues and graces of hers, Edith could hardly 
be persuaded. What noble woman would have kept 
such a cruel secret from the husband she loved !

CHAPTER XVI. 



CONFEDERATES. 




IASPER CAMERON was left with his travel- 
ing bag at one of the principle railroad depots. 
After the carriage was well out of sight, he 
walked down the platform with a brisk step and or- 
dered the hack driver to take him to an obscure street. 
He stopped at a dingy-looking brick house, the shutters 
of- which were closed, and the whole place wearing a 
rather forlorn and solitary air. There was a square, 
brass knocker, like a door plate — and he rapped lightly 
with this. 

" I knew } T our knock, Jasper," said the woman who 
answered the door. " I am glad to see you. Are you 
prospering?" 

She was of medium size, rather thin and* dark, 
somewhat sallow, but she had very light hazel eyes, 
tinted with yellow, and they gave her a hesitating, fur- 
tive appearance. 

" The best of luck, Aunt Mildred ;" and he laughed 
gaj-ly. "I have come to stay a few days, much to 
your sorrow." 

" Sorrow ! How can you, Jasper? You know that 



I am only too glad to see you. I was afraid j'ou had 
had some bad luck. Come in and tell me." 

He marched jauntily into the parlor — a dark, old- 
fashioned place, smelling close and musty— but as he 
took a breath or two he said — 

" Why not go up to my own room at once? This is 
euough to give one a fit of the blues." 

"As you like." 

The two trudged up-stairs. At the end of the hall 
she opened a door into a rather more cheerful-looking 
apartment. 

u No one has been in since! There was a % woman 
very anxious to hire it." 

"Never you mind, my beauty. I will pay you oh 
well as any woman in the lot." 

" Oh, it was not that, Jasper. Besides, I have three 
old ladies now — enough to try any one's patience. 
But I want to hear about you. And how is she? You 
said she was sick." 

" Oh, improving ; " in a careless tone. 

" Jasper, it would not do for her to die ! " 

A kind of earnest flush deepened over her sallow face. 

" No fear of that. It was mostly fright." 

" Does she care for you? I used to think she loved 
you then — but girls soon forget," and she sighed. 

" I have the means of bringing her to remembrance, 
you know ; " and he gave a heartless laugh. 

" And you think — It would be a great fortune to 




lose, Jasper!" 

There was an avaricious gleam in her eye that gave 
her a very unpleasant expression. 

" I do not mean to lose it," he returned positive!}'. 

" I kept the secret so long — it must have been for 
your sake. She never should have had a penny after 
all her airs and contempt of me, who would have been 
the best friend she ever had ! " 

The woman clinched her bony fingers with some old, 
revengeful feeling. 

" You will come out on the winning side, Aunt Mill}*. 
No more keeping old lady boarders then ! Now I must 
take, a little run down to the lower end of the city. I 
may not be back until night, and never mind about 
supper." 

" But, Jasper, you have not told me anything ! " 

" Do not spoil the broth by taking all the flavoring 
out of it beforehand. When I have anything to tell, 
you shall hear it, surely. In a month or so, maybe. 
There is the key — shake out those traps a little, and 
hang them up. I must be off to keep an engagement." 

With that, he sprang lightly down the stairs and let 
himself out almost noiselessfy. His next business was 
with Leonard Colby. 

He found Mr. Colby in his office as usual, but was 
invited into the private room at once. He fancied that 
the lawyer's brow wore a rather thoughtful and haggard 
expression. 



"I have been expecting you for several daj*s," lie 
began in a rather distant tone. 

" Oh, there was no hurry," and Cameron settled him- 
self in an easy position. "I did not know but your 
fertile brain might find a better way out of the difficulty." 

" You have seen Mrs. — " 

i ' Mrs. Cameron — yes . " 

u Have you come to any conclusion?" 

"We have been making a kind of agreement. By 
Jove  Colby, I have half a mind to win the woman 
and the fortune both ! She is a fine, spirited creature, 
and with a peculiar beauty that gives her the air of a 
tragedy queen, at times. Suppose, in about a month, I 
bring her down here and introduce her as my wife, and 
we have the business fairly settled ? Can you be ready ? " 

Colby had grown ghastly pale, while listening to this 
confident speech. 

"She does not love you, Cameron. You cannot 
make me believe that!" he tried to say in a steady 
voice. 

"Oh, I shall not chaff you with impossibilities, 
never fear that. There was the foundation of an old 
girlish passion. In those days she thought me an 
Apollo or demi-god. Tremaine was more to her taste 
after sober consideration. She never had the confidence 
to tell him of the escapade, thinking I was dead, and 
that he would not be likely to hear it from others. Of 
course, it surprised him immensely ! " 




"How did he learn it?" 

"She was afraid to go with mc and confess, so I 
went alone. Tremaine took it pretty hard. She has 
gone to stay with a friend of hers, at my request, and 
he has made no effort to see her thus far." 

"The case looks bad for her ; but, Cameron, I must 
see her, must hear from her own lips what choice she 
designs to make of her own free will." 

"I am not sure that she will be allowed any choice. 
Tremaine may wish to repudiate her ; if he should, she 
might return to her first love quite easily." 

" Cameron, men do not talk of women in that fashion 
whom they love and respect." 

" Well, I will confess that several times I have had 
an almost tigerish desire to call her mine once more. 
I have been tempted to rush to the very extent of the 
law and compel her to fulfil her first vows. So much 
for my feelings on that score, which I take it is pretty 
near love. A higher motive has urged me to wait. If 
she comes to me of her own free will, I shall forget 
the past — " 

"In consideration of the fortune, perhaps. Would 
you be as generous to a woman with no fortune?" the 
lawyer asked dryly. 

"That would be entirely my own affair. She has a 
fortune, which is your chief concern at present. We 
have made an agreement — for a month she is to remain 
in seclusion, and most kindly gives me the privilege of 



visiting her. If. during that time, I succeed in making 
a favorable impression, and Mr. Tremaine evinces a 
disinclination to renewttieir former relations — for that 
may influence her — the matter may be amicably set- 
tled. I see no reason why I should not use my best 
endeavors, since I find that I do care for her." 

Jasper Cameron announced this with great apparent 
honesty. Colby realized, turn whichever way he might, 
that he was still in the man's grasp. 

"Suppose she should decide even then not to return 
to you?" 

" If I fail to gain her own free consent, I shall give 
her up. I am not so much of a villain as you think. 
But in that case I shall see every penny of her fortune 
restored to her just the same. You proposed trusting 
to her generosity — why should not I ? If she does 
not care to accept me for her husband, she would give 
a good deal for legal liberty. I could easily place it in 
her way, you know ! " 

Yes, the man was hemmed in on every side. Ruin 
stared him in the face. 

" So I give you a month's grace, which js more than 
every one would do, granting that you do not mean to 
flit in the meanwhile. Matters may look brighter for 
you then." 

That was with Jasper Cameron's old, gay assurance. 

For an instant a wild idea entered Colby's brain. 
Suppose he took what he had and sought some other 



clime ? But there was the infamy to be cast upon his 
dear, innocent children — no, he could not endure that 
they should dl rise up and ha^ him. 

" You said the last time you were here that she knew 
nothing of the fortune ? " • 

"Very-true. She does not." 

" I think she will feel that the fortune was her great 
attraction in your eyes." 

"Well, I mean that she shall have it in any case," 
Cameron returned with a kind of dogged pertinacity. 

" Then you have given up an idea that you advanced 
in our other talk on this subject?" 

Drops of perspiration started out on Colby's pallid . 
brow, and he uttered the words rather huskily. He 
had been brooding over the temptation daily, and now 
to have it taken out of his way, seemed an actual loss. 
He was not sharp enough to guess that Jasper Cameron 
waited for this moment. 

" What was that?" with an assumption of forgetful- 
ness. "Oh, that you should buy me off instead of 
Mrs. Tremaine ! She has a small fortune of twelve or 
fifteen thousand, and at our first interview offered me 
every penny not to stand in the way of her legal freedom. 

If she had more, a larger sum would doubtless be at 
my disposal. That was before we had made our pres- 
ent conditions." 

Jasper Cameron lounged back in his chair and glanced 
carelessly at the lawyer. The next proposition was to 
come from him. 



"The story is such a very unusual one," Colby said, 
slowly. " And she must appear — " 

"Which she will in good time — but the day she 
appears, we commence proceedings. You have already 
seen Mrs. Mildred Cameron, and heard her story ; you 
have also seen a copy of the dead woman's confession, 
and the affidavit made by Giles Walsingham's daughter- 
in-law. There can be no doubt as to Dora's identity — 
but we may even And her mother." 

' * Enough," Colby exclaimed abruptly. " If I thought 
that Tremaine would forgive his wife, and that she 
desired to return to him — " and the lawyer wiped his 
forehead. 

"What then?" 

Colby groaned in desperation. He was hard pushed 
by his adversary. 

" I tell you what I will do, Colby. Granting that it 
is in our power to settle the affair, half of the fortune 
will content me. You cannot make any better terms 
out of any of them." 

"And if this were offered you as the husband of 
Dora—" 

" I would engage to keep my secret, in any case, and 
destroy these proofs in  your presence. Moreover, on 
the other hand, I should leave the country and place 
sufficient evidence in Mrs. Tremaine' s hands to enable 
her to get a divorce without any difficulty. I have no 
doubt that they would settle it amicably after awhile. 



AH this I engage to do, unless she should evince some 
returning tenderness for me. You cannot say but that 
I ana generous," and he laughed. 

" No one knows what you are!" returned Colby, 
gloomily. 

u Well, decide at j'our leisure. I am going away for 
a few days — and wheu I return, will look in upon you. 
Au ravoir," and making a jaunty bow, he walked out 
with an air of supreme indifference. 

So, there i£ was — the terms on which Mr. Colby 
migl»fc purchase comparative ease and wordly salvation. 
The trust and the legal interest upon it would reach a 
sum considerably above two hundred thousand. He 
was not sure that he could make up the amount at so 
short a notice. Oh, if he had never had the trust at all, 
but gone on living simply ! And yet a hundred thou- 
sand was not to be despised . It would keep their position , 
it would marry his darling happily, and give the others 
their ordinary comforts. And then he might have some 
good luck and retrieve his loss — whereas, if he began 
without a dollar, how could he, at his age, ever get any 
considerable sum together again ? 

Would it wrong Mrs. Tremaine so very much? The 
villain would be bought off of her path. In time, as 
Cameron had said, she and Mr. Tremaine might come 
to an amicable understanding, and be not much the 
worse for the brief interruption. Because the man car- 
ried matters with such a high hand, he had succeeded 



in impressing Colby with a certain regard for his power, 
and he knew him to be most unscrupulous. He would 
bind Cameron in such a manner that the strictest justice 
should be done to Mrs. Tremaine. Then,, it was not 
as if she were penniless. She had something of her 
own, and the probabilities were that Mr. Tremaine 
would overlook the unfortunate occurrence, and take 
his wife back to his heart and home — for after all, she 
was much more his than Jasper Cameron's. 

Mr. Colby's own safety was of greater importance to 
him than anything else, though he persuaded himself 
that he was viewing the case very impartially. If 
Cameron settled with Mrs. Tremaine, it was more than 
likely that she would relinquish half of her fortune, to 
say .the least, for freedom. So in that case he was 
paying him no higher price than she would. Then if 
he had used his influence to the uttermost he believed 
he might have led Giles Walsingham to disinherit this 
grandchild altogether — and he began to fancy himself 
the most unfortunate one in the whole party, since he 
had taken all the trouble and anxiety of the trust, and 
was to reap none of its benefits. First and last, he had 
known of a good many business matters that, if you
