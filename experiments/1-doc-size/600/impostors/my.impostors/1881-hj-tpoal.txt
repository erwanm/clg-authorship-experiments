the grandeur that had shown itself a moment before "it is my 
personal independence." 

But whatever there was of grandeur in this speech moved 
Caspar Goodwood's admiration ; there was nothing that displeased 
him in the sort of feeling it expressed. This feeling not .only did 
no violence to his way of looking at the girl he wished to make 
his wife, but seemed a grace the more in so ardent a spirit. To 
his mind she had always had wings, and this was but the nutter 
of those stainless pinions. He was not afraid of having a wife 
with a certain largeness of movement ; he was a man of long 



 

steps himself. Isabel's words, if they had been meant to shock 
him, failed of the mark, and only made him smile with the 
sense that here was common ground. " Who would wish less 
to curtail your liberty than I?" he asked. "What can give 
me greater pleasure than to see you perfectly independent 
doing whatever you like 1 It is to make you independent that 
I want to marry you." 

" That's a beautiful sophism," said the girl, with a smile more 
beautiful still. 

" An unmarried woman a girl of your age is not inde- 
pendent. There are all sorts of things she can't do. She is 
hampered at every step." 

" That's as she looks at the question," Isabel answered, with 
much spirit. " I am not in my first youth I can do what I 
choose I belong quite to the independent class. I have neither 
father nor mother ; I am poor ; 1 am of a serious disposition, 
and not pretty. I therefore am not bound to be timid and 
conventional ; indeed I can't afford such luxuries. Besides I 
try to judge things for myself; to judge wrong, 1 think, is more 
honourable than not to judge at all. I don't wish to be a mere 
sheep in the flock ; I wish to choose my fate and know some- 
thing of human affairs beyond what other people think it com- 
patible with propriety to tell me." She paused a moment, but 
not long enough for her companion to reply. He was apparently 
on the point of doing so, when she went on " Let me say this 
to you, Mr. Goodwood. You are so kind as to speak of being 
afraid of my marrying. If you should hear a rumour that I 
am on the point of doing so girls are liable to have such things 
said about them remember what I have told you about my 
love of liberty, and venturfe to doubt it." 

There was something almost passionately positive in the tone 
in which Isabel gave him this advice, and he saw a shining 
candour in her eyes which helped him to believe her. On the 
whole he felt reassured, and you might have perceived it by the 
manner in which he said, quite eagerly " You want simply to 
travel for two years ? I am quite willing to wait two years, and 
you may do what you like in the interval. If that is all you 
want, pray say so. I don't want you to be conventional ; do I 
strike you: as conventional myself ? Do you want to improve 
your mind 1 Your iuind is quite good enough for me ; .but if 
it interests you to wander about a while and see different 
countries, I shall be delighted to help you, in any way in my 
power." 

" You are very generous ; that is nothing new to me. The 



 

best way to help me will be to put as many hundred miles of 
sea between us as possible." 

" One would think you were going to commit a crime ! " said 
Caspar Goodwood. 

" Perhaps I am. I wish to be free even to do that, if the 
fancy takes me." 

"Well then," he said, slowly, "I will go home." And he 
put out his hand, trying to look contented and confident. 

Isabel's confidence in him, however, was greater than any he 
could feel in her. Not that he thought her capable of commit- 
ting a crime } but, turn it over as he would, there was something 
ominous in the way she reserved her option. As Isabel took 
his hand, she felt a great respect for him ; she knew how much 
he cared for her, and she thought him magnanimous. They 
stood so for a moment, looking at each other, united by a hand- 
clasp which was not merely passive on her side. "That's 
right," she said, very kindly, almost tenderly. " You will lose 
nothing by being a reasonable man." 

" But I will come back, wherever you are, two years hence," 
he returned, with characteristic grimness. 

We have seen that our young lady was inconsequent, and at 
this she suddenly changed her note. "Ah, remember, I 
promise nothing absolutely nothing!" Then more softly, as 
if tu help him to leave her, she added " And remember, too, 
that I shall not be an easy victim ! " 

" You will get very sick of your independence." 

" Perhaps I shall ; it is even very probable. When that day 
comes I shall be very glad to see you." 

She had laid her hand on the knob of the door that led into 
her room, and she waited a moment to see whether her visitor 
would not take his departure. But he appeared unable to 
move ; there was stiil an immense unwillingness in his attitude 
a deep remonstrance in his eyes. 

" I must leave you now," said Isabel ; and she opened the 
door, and passed into the other room. 

This apartment was dark, but the darkness was tempered by 
a vague radiance sent up through the window from the court 
of the hotel, and Isabel could make out the masses of the 
furniture, the dim shining of the mirror, and the looming of the 
big four-posted bed. She stood still a moment, listening, and 
at last she heard Caspar Goodwood walk out of the sitting-room 
and close the door behind him. She stood still a moment 
longer, and then, by an irresistible impulse, she dropped on her 
knees before her bed, and hid her face in her arms. 



 



XVII. 

SHE was not praying ; she was trembling trembling all 
over. She was an excitable creature, and now she .was much 
excited ; but she wished to resist her excitement, and the 
attitude of prayer, which she kept for some time, seemed to 
help her to be still. She was extremely glad Caspar Goodwood 
was gone ; there was something exhilarating in having got rid 
of him. As Isabel became conscious of this feeling she bowed 
her head a little lower ; the feeling was there, throbbing in her 
heart ; it was a part of her emotion ; but it was a thing to be 
ashamed of it was profane and out of place. It was not for 
some ten minutes that she rose from her knees, and when she 
came back to the sitting-room she was still trembling a little. 
Her agitation had two causes ; part of it was to be accounted 
for by her long discussion with Mr. Goodwood, but it might be 
feared that the rest was simply the enjoyment she found in the 
exercise of her power. She sat down in the same chair again, 
and took up her book, but Avithout going through the form of 
opening the volume. She leaned back, with that low, soft, 
aspiring murmur with which she often expressed her gladness 
in accidents of which the brighter side was not superficially 
obvious, and gave herself up to the satisfaction of having re- 
fused two ardent suitors within a fortnight. That love of 
liberty of which she had given Caspar Goodwood so bold a 
sketch was as yet almost exclusively thnoretic ; she had not 
been able to indulge it- on a large scale. But it seemed to her 
that she had done somnthing ; she had tasted of the delight, if 
not of battle, at least of victory ; she had done what she pre- 
ferred. In the midst of this agreeable sensation the image of 
Mr. Goodwood taking his sad walk homeward through the 
dingy town presented itself with a certain reproachful force ; so 
that, as at the same moment the door of the room was opened, 
she rose quickly with an apprehension that he had come back. 
But it was only Henrietta Stackpole returning from her dinner. 

Miss Stackpole immediately saw that something had happened 
to Isabel, and indeed the discovery demanded no great penetra- 
tion. Henrietta went straight up to her friend, who received 
her without a greeting. Isabel's elation in having sent Caspar 
Goodwood back to America pre-supposed her being glad that he 
had come to see her ; but at the same time she perfectly remem- 
bered that Henrietta had had no right to set a trap for her. 



 

" Has he been here, dear   " Miss Stackpole inquired, softly. 

Isabel turned away, and for some moments answered nothing. 

" You acted very wrongly," she said at last. 

" I acted for the best, dear. I only hope you acted as well." 

" You are not the judge. I can't trust you," said Isabel. 

This declaration was unflattering, but Henrietta was much too 
unselfish to heed the charge it conveyed ; she cared only for 
what it intimated with regard to her friend. 

"Isabel Archer," she declared, with equal abruptness and 
solemnity, " if you marry one of these people, I will never speak 
to you again ! " 

" Before making so terrible a threat, you had better wait till 
I am asked," Isabel replied. Never having said a word to Miss 
Stackpole about Lord Warburton's overtures, she had now no 
impulse whatever to justify herself to Henrietta by telling her 
that she had refused that nobleman. 

" Oh, you'll be asked quick enough, once you get off on the 
continent. Annie Climber was asked three times in Italy poor 
plain little Annie." 

" Well, if Annie Climber was not captured, why should 
Ibe " 

" I don't believe Annie was pressed ; but you'll be." 

" That's a flattering conviction," said Isabel, with a laugh. 

'" I don't flatter you, Isabel, I tell you the truth ! " cried her 
friend. " I hope you don't mean to tell me that you didn't give 
Mr. Goodwood some hope." 

" I don't see why I should tell you anything ; as I said to 
you just now, I can't trust you. But since you are so much 
interested in Mr. Goodwood, I won't conceal from you that he 
returns immediately to America." 

"You don't mean to say you have sent him off? " Henrietta 
broke out in dismay. 

" I asked him to leave me alone ; and I ask you the same, 
Henrietta." 

Miss Stackpole stood there with expanded eyes, and then she 
went to the mirror over the chimney-piece and took off her 
bonnet. 

" I hope you have enjoyed your dinner," Isabel remarked, 
lightly, as she did so. 

But Miss Stackpole was not to be diverted by frivolous pro- 
positions, nor bribed by the offer of autobiographic opportunities. 

" Do you know where you are going, Isabel Archer 1 " 

"Just now I am going to bed," said Isabel, with persistent 
frivolity. 



 

" Do you know where you are drifting   " Henrietta went on 
holding out her bonnet delicately. 

"No, I haven't the least idea, and I find it very pleasant 
not to know. A swift carnage, of a dark night, rattling with 
four horses over roads that one can't see that's my idea of 
happiness." 

" Mr. Goodwood certainly didn't teach you to say such things 
as that like the heroine of an immoral novel," said Miss Stack- 
pole. " You are drifting to some great mistake." 

Isabel was irritated by her friend's interference, but even in 
the midst of her irritation she tried to think what truth this 
declaration could represent. She could think of nothing that 
diverted her from saying " You must be very fond of me, 
Henrietta, to be willing to be so disagreeable to me." 

" I love you, Isabel!' said Miss Stackpole, with feeling. 

" Well, if you love me, let me alone. I asked that of Mr. 
Goodwood, and I must also ask it of you." 

" Take care you are not let alone too much." 

" That is what Mr. Goodwood said to me. I told him I must 
take the risks." 

" You are a creature of risks you make me shudder ! " cried 
Henrietta. " When does Mr. Goodwood return to America ?" 

" I don't know he didn't tell me." 

" Perhaps you didn't inquire," said Henrietta, with the note 
of righteous irony. 

" I gave him too little satisfaction to have the right to ask 
questions of him." 

This assertion seemed to Miss Stackpole for a moment to bid 
defiance to comment ; but at last she exclaimed " Well, Isabel, 
if I didn't know you, I might think you were heartless ! " 

" Take care," said Isabel; " you are spoiling me." 

" I am afraid I have done that already. I hope, at least," 
Miss Stackpole added, " that he may cross with Annie 
Climber ! " 

Isabel learned from her the next morning that she had deter- 
mined not to return to Gardencourt (where old Mr. Touchett 
had promised her a renewed welcome), but to await in London 
the arrival of the invitation that Mr. Bantling had promised her 
from his sister, Lady Pensil. Miss Stackpole related very freely 
her conversation with Ealph Touchett's sociable friend, and 
declared to Isabel that she really believed she had now got hold 
of something that would lead to something. On the receipt of 
Lady Pensil's letter Mr. Bantling had virtually guaranteed 
the arrival of this document she would immediately depart for 



 

Bedfordshire, and if Isabel cared to look out for her impressions 
in the Interviewer, she would certainly find them. Henrietta 
was evidently going to see something of the inner life this time. 

"Do you know where you are drifting, Henrietta Stackpolel " 
Isabel asked, imitating the tone in which her friend had spoken 
the night before. 

" I am drifting to a big position that of queen of American 
journalism. If my next letter isn't copied all over the West, 
I'll swallow my pen- wiper ! " 

She had arranged with her friend Miss Annie Climber, the 
young lady of the continental offers, that they should go together 
to make those purchases which were to constitute Miss Climber's 
farewell to a hemisphere in which she at least had been appreci- 
ated ; and she presently repaired to Jermyn Street to pick up 
her companion. Shortly after her departure Ealph Touclfett 
was announced, and as soon as he came in Isabel saw that he 
had something on his mind. He very soon took his cousin 
into his confidence. He had received a telegram from his 
mother, telling him that his father had had a sharp attack of 
his old malady, that she was much alarmed, and that she begged 
Ralph would instantly return to Gardencourt. On this occa- 
sion, at least, Mrs. Touchett's devotion to the electric wire had 
nothing incongruous. 

" I have judged it best to see the great doctor, Sir Matthew 
Hope, first," Ealph said ; " by great good luck he's in town. He 
is to see me at half-past twelve, and I shall make sure of his 
coming down to Gardencourt which he will do the more readily 
as he has already seen my father several times, both there and in 
London. There is an express at two-forty-five, which I shall 
take, and you will come back with me, or remain here a few 
days longer, exactly as you prefer." 

" I will go with you ! " Isabel exclaimed. " I don't suppose 
I can be of any use to my uncle, but if he is ill I should like to 
be near him." 

"I think you like him," said Ralph, with a certain shy 
pleasure in his eye. " You appreciate him, which all the world 
hasn't done. The quality is too fine." 

" I think I love him," said Isabel, simply. 

" That's very well. After his son, he is your greatest admirer." 

Isabel welcomed this assurance, but she gave secretly a little 
sigh of relief at the thought that Mr. Touchett was one of those 
admirers who could not propose to marry her. This, however, 
was not what she said ; she went on to inform Ralph that there 
were other reasons why she should not remain in London. She 

L

was tired of it and wished to leave it ; and then Henrietta was 
going away going to stay in Bedfordshire." 

" In Bedfordshire ? " Ralph exclaimed, with surprise. 

"With Lady Pensil, the sister of Mr. Bantling, who has 
answered for an invitation." 

Ralph was feeling anxious, but at this he broke into a laugh. 
Suddenly, however, he looked grave again. " Bantling is a man 
of courage. But if the invitation should get lost on the way   " 

" I thought the British post-office was impeccable." 

" The good Homer sometimes nods," said Ralph. " However," 
he went on, more brightly, " the good Bantling never does, and, 
whatever happens, he will take care of Henrietta," 

Ralph went to keep his appointment with Sir Matthew Hope, 
and Isabel made her arrangements for quitting Pratt's Hotel. 
He"r uncle's danger touched her nearly, and while she stood 
before her open trunk, looking about her vaguely for what she 
should put into it, the tears suddenly rushed into her eyes. It 
was perhaps for this reason that when Ralph came back at two 
o'clock to take her to the station she was not yet ready. 

He found Miss Stackpole, however, in the sitting-room, where 
she had just risen from the lunch-table, and this lady immedi- 
ately expressed her regret at his father's illness. 

" He is a grand old man," she said ; " he is faithful to the 
last. If it is really to be the last excuse my alluding to it, 
but you must often have thought of the possibility I am sorry 
that I shall not be at Gardencourt." 

"You will amuse yourself much more in Bedfordshire."  

" I shall be sorry to amuse myself at such a time," said 
Henrietta, with much propriety. But she immediately added 
" I should like so to commemorate the closing scene." 

" My father may live a long time," said Ralph, simply. 
Then, adverting to topics more cheerful, he interrogated Miss 
Stackpole as to her own future. 

Now that Ralph was in trouble, she addressed him in a tone 
of larger allowance, and told him that she was much indebted 
to him for having made her acquainted with Mr. Bantling. 
" He has told me just the things I want to know," she said ; 
" all the society-items and all about the royal family. I can't 
make out that what he tells me about the royal family is much 
to their credit ; but he says that's only my peculiar way of 
looking at it. Well, all I want is that he should give me the 
facts; I can put them together quick enough, once I've got 
them." And she added that Mr. Bantling had been so good 
as to promise to come and take her out in the afternoon. 



 

" To take you where ? " Ralph ventured to inquire. 

" To Buckingham Palace. He is going to show me over it, 
so that I may get some idea how they live." 

" Ah," said Ralph, " we leave you in good hands. The first 
thing we shall hear is that you are invited to Windsor Castle." 

" If they ask me, I shall certainly go. Once I get started I 
am not afraid. But for all that," Henrietta added in a moment, 
" I am not satisfied; I am not satisfied about Isabel." 

" What is her last misdemeanour ? " 

" Well, I have told you before, and I suppose there is no 
harm in my going on. I always finish a subject that I take up. 
Mr. Goodwood was here last night." 

Ralph opened his eyes ; he even blushed a little his blush 
being the sign of an emotion somewhat acute. He remembered 
that Isabel, in separating from him in Winchester Square, had 
repudiated his suggestion that her motive in doing so was the 
expectation of a visitor at Pratt 's Hotel, and it was a novel 
sensation to him to have to suspect her of duplicity. On the 
other hand, he quickly said to himself, what concern was it of 
his that she should have made an appointment with a lover 1 
Had it not been thought graceful in every age that young ladies 
should make a mystery of such appointments? Ralph made 
Miss Stackpole a diplomatic answer. " I should have thought 
that, with the views you expressed to me the other day, that 
would satisfy you perfectly." 

" That he should come to see her 1 That was very well, as 
far as it went. It was a little plot of mine ; I let him know 
that we were in London, and when it had been arranged that I 
should spend the evening out, I just sent him a word a word 
to the wise. I hoped he would find her alone ; I won't pretend 
I didn't hope that you would be out of the way. He came to 
see her ; but he might as well have stayed away." 

" Isabel was cruel ? " Ralph inquired, smiling, and relieved at 
learning that his cousin had not deceived him. 

" I don't exactly know what passed between them. But she 
gave him no satisfaction she sent him back to America." 

" Poor Mr. Goodwood ! " Ralph exclaimed. 

" Her only idea seems to be to get rid of him," Henrietta 
went on. 

" Poor Mr. Goodwood ! " repeated Ralph. The exclamation, 
it must be confessed, was somewhat mechanical. It failed 
exactly to express his thoughts, which were taking another 
line. 

" You don't say that as if you felt it ; I don't believe you care." 



" Ah," said Ralph, " you must remember that I don't know 
this interesting young man that I have never seen him." 

" Well, I shall see him, and I shall tell him not to give up. 
If I didn't believe Isabel would come round," said Miss Stack- 
pole " well, I'd give her up myself ! " 



XVIII. 

IT had occurred to Ralph that under the circumstances Isabel's 
parting with Miss Stackpolc might be of a slightly embarrassed 
nature, and he went down to the door of the hotel in advance 
of his cousin, who after a slight delay followed, with the traces 
of an unaccepted remonstrance, as he thought, in her eye. The 
two made the journey to Gardencourt in almost unbroken 
silence, and the servant who met them at the station had no 
better news to give them of Mr. Touchett a fact which caused 
Ralph to congratulate himself afresh on Sir Matthew Hope's 
having promised to come down in the five o'clock train and spend 
the night. Mrs. Touchett, he learned, on reaching home, had 
been constantly with the old man, and was with him at that 
moment ; and this fact made Ralph say to himself that, after 
all, what his mother wanted was simply opportunity. The 
finest natures were those that shone on large occasions. Isabel 
went to her own room, noting, throughout the house, that per- 
ceptible hush which precedes a crisis. At the end of an hour, 
however, she came down-stairs in search of her aunt, whom 
she wished to ask about Mr. Touchett. She went into the 
library, but Mrs. Touchett was not there, and as the weather, 
which had been damp and chill, was now altogether spoiled, 
it was not probable that she had gone for her usual walk in 
the grounds. Isabel was on the point of ringing to send an 
inquiry to her room, when her attention was taken by an un- 
expected sound the sound of low music proceeding appar- 
ently from the drawing-room. She knew that her aunt never 
touched the piano, and the musician was therefore probably 
Ralph, who played for his own amusement. That he should 
have resorted to this recreation at the present time, indicated 
apparently that his anxiety about his father had been relieved ; 
so that Isabel took her way to the drawing-room with much 
alertness. The drawing-room at Gardencourt was an apart- 
ment of great distances, and as the piano was placed at the end 
of it furthest removed from the door at which Isabel entered, 



 

her arrival was not noticed by the person seated before the 
instrument. This person was neither Balph nor his mother ; it 
was a lady whom Isabel immediately saw to be a stranger to 
herself, although her back was presented to the door. This 
back an ample and well-dressed one Isabel contemplated for 
some moments in surprise. The lady was of course a visitor 
who had arrived during her absence, and who had not been 
mentioned by either of the servants one of them her aunt's 
maid of whom she had had speech since her return. Isabel 
had already learned, however, that the British domestic is not 
effusive, and she was particularly conscious of having been 
treated with dryness by her aunt's maid, whose offered assistance 
the young lady from Albany versed, as young ladies are in 
Albany, in the very metaphysics of the toilet had perhaps 
made too light of. The arrival of a visitor was far from dis- 
agreeable to Isabel; she had not yet divested herself of a 
youthful impression that each new acquaintance would exert 
some momentous influence upon her life. By the time she 
had made these reflections she became aware that the lady at 
the piano played remarkably well. She was playing something 
of Beethoven's Isabel knew not what, but she recognised 
Beethoven and she touched the piano softly and discreetly, 
but with evident skill. Her touch was that of an artist ; Isabel 
sat down noiselessly on the nearest chair and waited till the 
end of the piece. When it was finished she felt a strong desire 
to thank the player, and rose from her seat to do so, while at the 
same time the lady at the piano turned quickly round, as if she 
had become aware of her presence. 

"That is very beautiful, and your playing makes it moro 
beautiful still," said Isabel, with all the young radiance with 
which she usually uttered a truthful rapture. 

"You don't think I disturbed Mr. Touchett, then?" the 
musician answered, as sweetly as this compliment deserved. 
" The house is so large, and his room so far away, that I thought 
I might venture especially as I played just just du bout des 



" She is a Frenchwoman," Isabel said to herself ; " she says 
that as if she were French." And this supposition made the 
stranger more interesting to our speculative heroine. " I hope 
my uncle is doing well," Isabel added. " I should think that 
to hear such lovely music as that would really make him feel 
better." 

The lady gave a discriminating smile. 

" I am afraid there are moments in life when even Beethoven 



 

has nothing to say to us. We must admit, however, that they
