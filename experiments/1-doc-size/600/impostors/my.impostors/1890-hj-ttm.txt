you're only going in to lose, you had better stay out." 

" How can I lose, with you? " the young man asked, 
smiling. She uttered a word, impatiently but indistinguish- 
ably, and he continued : " And even if I do, it will have been 
immense fun." 

" It is immense fun," said Julia. " But the best fun is to 
win. If you don't 

" If I don't? " he repeated, as she hesitated. 

" I'll never speak to you again." 

" How much you expect, even when you don't pay ! " 

Mrs. Dallow's rejoinder was a justification of this remark, 
embodying as it did the fact that if they should receive on the 
morrow certain information on which she believed herself 
entitled to count, information tending to show that the Tories 
meant to fight the seat hard, not to lose it again, she should 
look to him to be in the field as early as herself. Sunday was 
a lost day ; she should leave Paris on Monday. 

" Oh, they'll fight it hard ; they'll put up Kingsbury," said 
Nick, smoothing his hat. "They'll all come down all that 
can get away. And Kingsbury has a very handsome wife." 

" She is not so handsome as your cousin," Mrs. Dallow 
hazarded. 

"Oh dear, no a cousin sooner than a wife, any day!" 
Nick laughed as soon as he had said this, as if the speech had 
an awkward side ; but the reparation, perhaps, scarcely mended 
it, the exaggerated mock-meekness with which he added : 
" I'll do any blessed thing you tell me." 





" Come here to-morrow, then, as early as ten." She turned 
round, moving to the door with him ; but before they reached 
it she demanded, abruptly : " Pray, isn't a gentleman to do 
anything, to be anything? " 

"To be anything?" 

" If he doesn't aspire to serve the State." 

" To make his political fortune, do you mean ? Oh, bless 
me, yes, there are other things." 

" What other things, that can compare with that? " 

" Well, I, for instance, I'm very fond of the arts." 

"Of the arts?" 

"Did you never hear of them? I'm awfully fond of 
painting." 

At this Mrs. Dallow stopped shorb, and her fine gray eyes 
had for a moment the air of being set further forward in her 
head. " Don't be odious ! Good-night," she said, turning 
away and leaving him to go. 



VII. 

PETER SHEREINGHAM, the next day, reminded Nick that he 
had promised to be present with him at Madame Carre's 
interview with the ladies introduced to her by Gabriel Nash ; 
and in the afternoon, in accordance with this arrangement, the 
two men took their way to the Rue de Constantinople. They 
found Mr. Nash and his friends in the small beflounced 
drawing-room of the old actress, who, as they learned, had 
sent in a request for ten minutes' grace, having been detained 
at a lesson a rehearsal of a comedie de salon, to be given, for 
a charity, by a fine lady, at which she had consented to be 
present as an adviser. Mrs. Rooth sat on a black satin sofa, 
with her daughter beside her, and Gabriel Nash wandered 
about the room, looking at the votive offerings which converted 
the little panelled box, decorated in sallow white and gold, into 
a theatrical museum : the presents, the portraits, the wreaths, 
the diadems, the letters, framed and glazed, the trophies and 
tributes and relics collected by Madame Carre during half a 
century of renown. The profusion of this testimony was 
hardly more striking than the confession of something missed, 
something hushed, which seemed to rise from it all and make it 
melancholy, like a reference to clappings which, in the nature 




of things, could now only be present as a silence : so that if 
the place was full of history, it was the form without the fact, 
or at the most a redundancy of the one to a pinch of the other 
the history of a mask, of a squeak, a record of movements 
in the air. 

Some of the objects exhibited by the distinguished artist, 
her early portraits, in lithograph or miniature, represented 
the costume and embodied the manner of a period so remote 
that Nick Dormer, as he glanced at them, felt a quickened 
curiosity to look at the woman who reconciled being alive 
to-day with having been alive so long ago. Peter Sherringham 
already knew how she managed this miracle, but every visit 
he paid to her added to his amused, charmed sense that it was 
a miracle, that his extraordinary old friend had seen things 
that he should never, never see. Those were just the things 
he wanted to see most, and her duration, her survival, cheated 
him agreeably and helped him a little to guess them. His 
appreciation of the actor's art was so systematic that it had 
an antiquarian side, and at the risk of representing him as 
attached to a futility, it must be said that he had as yet hardly- 
known a keener regret for anything than for the loss of that 
antecedent world, and in particular for his having come too 
late for the great comedienne, the light of the French stage in 
the early years of the century, of whose example and instruction 
Madame Carre had had the inestimable benefit. She had often 
described to him her rare predecessor, straight from whose 
hands she had received her most celebrated parts, and of whom 
her own manner was often a religious imitation ; but her 
descriptions troubled him more than they consoled, only con- 
firming his theory, to which so much of his observation had 
already ministered, that the actor's art, in general, is going 
down and down, descending a slope with abysses of vulgarity 
at its foot, after having reached its perfection, more than fifty 
years ago, in the talent of the lady in question. He would 
have liked to dwell for an hour beneath the meridian. 

Gabriel Nash introduced the new-comers to his companions ; 
but the younger of the two ladies gave no sign of lending 
herself to this transaction. The girl was very white ; she 
huddled there, silent and rigid, frightened to death, staring, 
expressionless. If Bridget Dormer had seen her at this 
moment she might have felt avenged for the discomfiture she 
had suffered the day before, at the Salon, under the challenging 
eyes of Maud Yavasour. It was plain at the present hour, 
that Miss Vavasour would have run away had she not felt 





that the persons present would prevent her escape. Her aspect 
made Nick Dormer feel as if the little temple of art in which 
they were collected had been the waiting-room of a dentist. 
Sherringham had seen a great many nervous girls trembling 
before the same ordeal, and he liked to be kind to them, to 
,say things that would help them to do themselves justice. 
The probability, in a given case, was almost overwhelmingly 
in favour of their having any other talent one could think of 
in a higher degree than the dramatic ; but he could rarely for- 
bear to interpose, even as against. his conscience, to keep the 
occasion from being too cruel. There were occasions indeed 
that could scarcely be too cruel to punish properly certain 
examples of presumptuous ineptitude. He remembered what 
Mr. Nash had said about this blighted maiden, and perceived 
that though she might be inept she was now anything but 
presumptuous. Gabriel fell to talking with Nick Dormer, and 
Peter addressed himself to Mrs. Rooth. There was no use as 
yet in saying anything to the girl ; she was too scared even to 
hear. Mrs. Rooth, with her shawl fluttering about her, nestled 
against her daughter, putting out her hand to take one of 
Miriam's, soothingly. She had pretty, silly, near-sighted eyes, 
a long, thin nose and an upper lip which projected over the 
under as an ornamental cornice rests on its support. " So 
much depends really everything ! " she said in answer to 
some sociable observation of Sherringham's. " It's either 
this," and she rolled her eyes expressively about the room, " or 
it's I don't know too much what ! " 

" Perhaps we're too many," Peter hazarded, to her daughter. 
" But really, you'll find, after you fairly begin, that you'll do 
better with four or five." 

Before she answered she turned her head and lifted her fine 
eyes. The next instant he saw they were full of tears. The 
word she spoke, however, though uttered in a deep, serious 
tone, had not the note of sensibility : " Oh, I don't care for 
you ! " He laughed at this, declared it was very well said 
and that if she could give Madame Carre such a specimen as 
that ! The actress came in before he had finished his phrase, 
and he observed the way the girl slowly got up to meet her, 
hanging her head a little and looking at her from under her 
brows. There was no sentiment in her face only a kind of 
vacancy of terror which had not even the merit of being fine 
of its kind, for it seemed stupid and superstitious. Yet the 
head was good, he perceived at the same moment ; it was 
strong and salient and made to tell at a distance. Madame 





Carre scarcely noticed her at first, greeting her only in her 
order, with the others, and pointing to seats, composing the 
circle with smiles and gestures, as if they were all before the 
prompter's box. The old actress presented herself to a casual 
glance as a red-faced woman in a wig, with beady eyes, a 
hooked nose and pretty hands ; but Nick Dormer, who had a 
perception of physiognomy, speedily observed that these free 
characteristics included a great deal of delicate detail an 
eyebrow, a nostril, a flitting of expressions, as if a multitude 
of little facial wires were pulled from within. This accom- 
plished artist had in particular a mouth which was visibly a 
rare instrument, a pair of lips whose curves and fine corners 
spoke of a lifetime of " points" unerringly made and verses 
exquisitely spoken, helping to explain the purity of the sound 
that issued from them. Her whole countenance had the look 
of long service of a thing infinitely worn and used, drawn 
and stretched to excess, with its elasticity overdone and its 
springs relaxed, yet religiously preserved and kept in repair, 
like an old valuable time-piece, which might have quivered and 
rumbled, but could be trusted to strike the hour. At the 
first words she spoke Gabriel Nash exclaimed, endearingly : 
" Ah, la voix de Celimene ! " Celimene, who wore a big red 
flower on the summit of her dense wig, had a very grand air, 
a toss of the head and sundry little majesties of manner ; in 
addition to which she was strange, almost grotesque, and to 
some people would have been even terrifying, capable of re- 
appearing, with her hard eyes, as a queer vision in the darkness. 
She excused herself for having made the company wait, and 
mouthed and mimicked in the drollest way, with intonations 
as fine as a flute, the performance and the pretensions of the 
belles dames to whom she had just been endeavouring to com- 
municate a few of the rudiments. " Mais celles-la, c'est une 
plaisanterie," she went on, to Mrs. Rooth ; "whereas you and 
your daughter, chere madame I am sure that you are quite 
another matter." 

The girl had got rid of her tears and was gazing at her, and 
Mrs. Rooth leaned forward and said insinuatingly : " She 
knows four languages." 

Madame Carre gave one of her histrionic stares, throwing 
back her head. " That's three too many. The thing is to do 
something with one of them." 

" We're very much in earnest," continued Mrs. Rooth, who 
spoke excellent French. 

" I'm glad to hear it il riy a que fa. La tete cst bien the 





head is very good," she said, looking at the girl. " But let us 
see, my dear child, what you've got in it ! " The young lady 
was still powerless to speak ; she opened her lips, but nothing 
came. With the failure of this effort she turned her deep, 
sombre eyes upon the three men. " Un beau regard it carries 
well," Madame Carre hinted. But even as she spoke Miss 
Rooth's fine gaze was suffused again, and the next moment she 
had begun to weep. Nick Dormer sprung up ; he felt em- 
barrassed and intrusive there was such an indelicacy in sitting 
there to watch a poor girl's struggle with timidity. There was 
a momentary confusion ; Mrs. Rooth's tears were seen also to 
flow ; Gabriel Nash began to laugh, addressing however at the 
same time the friendliest, most familiar encouragement to his 
companions, and Peter Sherringham offered to retire with Nick 
on the spot, if their presence was oppressive to the young 
lady. But the agitation was over in a minute ; Madame Carre 
motioned Mrs. Booth out of her seat and took her place beside 
the girl, and Gabriel Nash explained judiciously to the other 
men that she would be worse if they were to go away. Her 
mother begged them to remain, " so that there should be at 
least some English ; " she spoke as if the old actress were an 
army of Frenchwomen. The girl was quickly better, and 
Madame Carre, on the sofa beside her, held her hand and 
emitted a perfect music of reassurance. " The nerves, the 
nerves they are half of our trade. Have as many as you 
like, if you've got something else too. Voyons do you know 
anything? " 

" I know some pieces." 

" Some pieces of the repertoire ? " 

Miriam Rooth stared as if she didn't understand. " I know 
some poetry." 

" English, French, Italian, German," said her mother. 

Madame Carre gave Mrs. Rooth a look which expressed 
irritation at the recurrence of this announcement. " Does she 
wish to act in all those tongues ] The phrase-book isn't the 
comedy." 

" It is only to show you how she has been educated." 

" Ah, chere madame, there is no education that matters ! I 
mean save the right one. Your daughter must have a language, 
like me, like ces messieurs." 

"You see if I can speak French," said the girl, smiling 
dimly at her hostess. She appeared now almost to have 
collected herself. 

" You speak it in perfection." 





" And English just as well," said Miss Rooth. 

" You oughtn't to be an actress ; you ought to be a 
governess." 

" Oh, don't tell us that : it's to escape from that ! " pleaded 
Mrs. Rooth. 

"I'm very sure your daughter will escape from that," Peter 
Sherringharn was moved to remark. 

" Oh, if you could help her ! " the lady exclaimed, pathetically. 

" She has certainly all the qualities that strike the eye," said 
Peter. 

" You are most kind, sir ! " Mrs. Rooth declared, elegantly 
draping herself. 

" She knows Celimene ; I have heard her do Celimene," 
Gabriel Nash said to Madame Carre\ 

" And she knows Juliet, and Lady Macbeth, and Cleopatra," 
added Mrs. Rooth. 

" Voyons, my dear child, do you wish to work for the French 
stage or for the English ? " the old actress demanded. 

" Ours would have sore need of you, Miss Rooth," Sherring- 
ham gallantly interposed. 

" Could you speak to any one in London could you introduce 
her? " her mother eagerly asked. 

" Dear madam, I must hear her first, and hear what Madame 
Carre says." 

" She has a voice of rare beauty, and I understand voices," 
said Mrs. Rooth. 

" Ah, then, if she has intelligence she has every gift." 

" She has a most poetic mind," the old lady went on. 

" I should like to paint her portrait ; she's made for that," 
Nick Dormer ventured to observe to Mrs. Rooth ; partly 
because he was struck with the girl's capacity as a model, 
partly to mitigate the crudity of inexpressive spectatorship. 

" So all the artists say. I have had three or four heads of 
her, if you would like to see them : she has been done in 
several styles. If you were to do her I am sure it would make 
her celebrated." 

" And me too," said Nick, laughing. 

" It would indeed, a member of Parliament ! " Nash 
declared. 

" Ah, I have the honour " murmured Mrs. Rooth, looking 
gratified and mystified. 

Nick explained that she had no honour at all, and mean- 
while Madame Carre had been questioning the girl. " Chere 
madame, I can do nothing with your daughter : she knows too 




much ! '' she broke out. " It's a pity, because I like to catch 
them wild." 

" Oh, she's wild enough, if that's all ! And that's the very 
point, the question of where to try," Mrs. Rooth went on. 
" Into what do I launch her upon what dangerous, stormy 
sea? I've thought of it so anxiously." 

" Try here try the French public : they're so much the 
most serious," said Gabriel Nash. 

" Ah, no, try the English : there's such a rare opening ! " 
Sherringham exclaimed, in quick opposition. 

" Ah, it isn't the public, dear gentlemen. It's the private 
side, the other people it's the life it's the moral atmosphere." 

" Je ne connais quune scene la notre," Madame Carre 
asserted. " I have been informed there is no other." 

"And very correctly," said Gabriel Nash. "The theatre in 
our countries is puerile and barbarous." 

"There is something to be done for it, and perhaps made- 
moiselle is the person to do it," Sherringham suggested, 
contentiously. 

"Ah, but, en attendant, what can it do for her ?" Madame 
Carre asked. 

"Well, anything that I can help it to do," said Peter Sherring- 
ham, who was more and more struck with the girl's rich type. 
Miriam Rooth sat in silence, while this discussion went on, 
looking from one speaker to the other with a suspended, literal 
air. 

" Ah, if your part is marked out, I congratulate you, made- 
moiselle ! " said the old actress, underlining the words as she 
had often underlined such words on the stage. She smiled 
with large permissiveness on the young aspirant, who appeared 
not to understand her. Her tone penetrated, however, to 
certain depths in the mother's nature, adding another stir to 
agitated waters. 

" I feel the responsibility of what she shall find in the life, 
the standards, of the theatre," Mrs. Rooth explained. " Where 
is the purest tone where are the highest standards? that's 
what I ask," the good lady continue.!, with a persistent candour 
which elicited a peal of unceremonious but sociable laughter 
from Gabriel Nash. 

''The purest tone quest-ce-que-c'est que fa ? " Madame Carre 
demanded, in the finest manner of modern comedy. 

" We are very, very respectable," Mrs. Rooth went on, 
smiling and achieving lightness, too. " What I want to do is 
to place my daughter where the conduct and the picture of 





conduct, in which she should take part wouldn't be absolutely 
dreadful. Now, chore madarne, how about all that? how about 
the conduct in the French theatre the things she should see, 
the things she should hear ? " 

" I don't think I know what you are talking about. They 
are the things she may see and hear everywhere ; only they 
are better done, they are better said. The only conduct that 
concerns an actress, it seems to me, is her own, and the only 
way for her to behave herself is not to be a stick. I know no 
other conduct." 

"But there are characters, there are situations, which I 
don't think I should like to see her undertake." 

" There are many, no doubt, which she would do well to 
leave alone ! " laughed the Frenchwoman. 

" I shouldn't like to see her represent a very bad woman a 
really bad one," Mrs. Rooth serenely pursued. 

"Ah, in England, then, and in your theatre, every one is 
good? Your plays must be even more ingenious than I 
supposed." 

" We haven't any plays," said Gabriel Nash. 

" People will write them for Miss Rooth it will be a new 
era," Peter Sherringham rejoined, with wanton, or at any 
rate combative, optimism. 

"Will you, sir will you do something? A sketch of some 
truly noble female type? " the old lady asked, engagingly. 

" Oh, I know what you do with our pieces to show your 
superior virtue ! " Madame Carre broke in, before he had time 
to reply that he wrote nothing but diplomatic memoranda. 
" Bad women ? Je rial joue que fa, madame. ' Really ' bad 
I tried to make them real ! " 

" I can say ' L' Aventuriere,' " Miriam interrupted, in a cold 
voice which seemed to hint at a want of participation in the 
maternal solicitudes. 

" Confer on us the pleasure of hearing you, then. Madame 
Carre will give you the replique," said Peter Sherringham. 

" Certainly, my child ; I can say it without the book," 
Madame Carre responded. "Put yourself there move that 
chair a little away." She patted her young visitor, encourag- 
ing her to rise, settling with her the scene they should take, 
while the three men sprang up to arrange a place for the 
performance. Miriam left her seat and looked vaguely round 
her ; then, having taken off her hat and given it to her 
mother, she stood on the designated spot with her eyes on the 
ground. Abruptly, however, instead of beginning the scene, 





Madame Carre turned to the elder lady with an air which 
showed that a rejoinder to this visitor's remarks of a moment 
before had been gathering force in her breast. 

" You mix things up, chere madame, and I have it on my 
heart to tell you so. I believe it's rather the case with you 
other English, and I have never been able to learn that either 
your morality or your talent is the gainer by it. To be too 
respectable to go where things are done best is, in my opinion, 
to be very vicious indeed ; and to do them badly in order to 
preserve your virtue is to fall into a grossness more shocking 
than any other. To do them well is virtue enough, and not to 
make a mess of it the only respectability. That's hard enough 
to merit Paradise. Everything else is base humbug ! Voila, 
chere madame, the answer I have for your scruples ! " 

"It's admirable admirable; and I am glad my friend 
Dormer here has had the great advantage of hearing you 
utter it ! " Gabriel Nash exclaimed, looking at Nick. 

Nick thought it, in effect, a speech denoting an intelligence 
of the question, but he rather resented the idea that Nash 
should assume that it would strike him as a revelation ; and 
to show his familiarity with the line of thought it indicated, 
as well as to play his part appreciatively in the little circle, he 
observed to Mrs. Rooth, as if they might take many things 
for granted : " In other words, your daughter must find her 
safeguard in the artistic conscience." But he had no sooner 
spoken than he was struck with the oddity of their discussing 
so publicly, and under the poor girl's nose, the conditions 
which Miss Rooth might find the best for the preservation of 
her personal integrity. However, the anomaly was light and 
unoppressive the echoes of a public discussion of delicate 
questions seemed to linger so familiarly in the egotistical little 
room. Moreover the heroine of the occasion evidently was 
losing her embarrassment; she was the priestess on the tripod, 
awaiting the afflatus arid thinking only of that. Her bared 
head, of which she had changed the position, holding it erect, 
while her arms hung at her sides, was admirable ; and her 
eyes gazed straight out of the window, at the houses on the 
opposite side of the Rue de Constantinople. 

Mrs. Rooth had listened to Madame Carre with startled, 
respectful attention, but Nick, considering her, was very sure 
that she had not understood her hostess's little lesson. Yet 
this did not prevent her from exclaiming in answer to him : 
" Oh, a fine artistic life what indeed is more beautiful? " 

Peter Sherringham had said nothing ; he was watching 





Miriam and her attitude. She wore a black dress, which fell 
in straight folds ; her face, under her mobile brows, was pale 
and regular, with a strange, strong, tragic beauty. " I don't 
know what's in her," he said to himself; "nothing, it would 
seem, from her persistent vacancy. But such a face as that, 
such a head, is a fortune ! " Madame Carre made her com- 
mence, giving her the first line of the speech of Clorinde : 
" Vous ne me fuyex pas, mon enfant, aujourd'hui." But still 
the girl hesitated, and for an instant she appeared to make a 
vain, convulsive effort. In this effort she frowned portentously; 
her low forehead overhung her eyes ; the eyes themselves, in 
shadow, stared, splendid and cold, and her hands clinched 
themselves at her sides. She looked austere and terrible, arid 
during this moment she was an incarnation the vividness of 
which drew from Sherringham a stifled cry. " Elle est bien 
belle ah, ?a ! " murmured the old actress ; and in the pause 
which still preceded the issue of sound from the girl's lips 
Peter turned to his kinsman and said in a low tone : 

"You must paint her just like that." 

"Like that?" 

"As the Tragic Muse." 

She began to speak ; a long, strong, colourless voice came 
quavering from her young throat. She delivered the lines of 
Clorinde, in the fine interview with Celie, in the third act of 
the play, with a rude monotony, and then, gaining confidence, 
with an effort at modulation which was not altogether success- 
ful and which evidently she felt not to be so. Madame Carre 
sent back the ball without raising her hand, repeating the 
speeches of Celie, which her memory possessed from their 
having so often been addressed to her, and uttering the verses 
with soft, communicative art. So they went on through the 
scene, and when it was over it had not precisely been a 
triumph for Miriam Rooth. Sherringham forbore to look at 
Gabriel Nash, and Madame Carre said : " I think you have a 
voice, ma fille, somewhere or other. "We must try and put our 
hand ori it." Then she asked her what instruction she had 
had, and the girl, lifting her eyebrows, looked at her mother, 
while her mother prompted her. 

" Mrs. Delamere, in London ; she was once an ornament of 
the English stage. She gives lessons just to a very few ; it's
