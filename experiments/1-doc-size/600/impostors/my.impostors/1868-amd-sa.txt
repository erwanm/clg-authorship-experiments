land, lie was still delicate with a high-bred spiritual 
beauty that seemed almost unearthly in his moments of 
enthusiasm. His whole soul was in his art, just as it had 
been in boyhood. Mrs. Endicott became greatly interested 
in him, but Grace found a stronger attraction in a com- 
panion of his, a young artist also. Arthur Wanlleigh was 
eminently calculated to please women, not with the super- 
ficial charm that had won Mr. Channing his successes, but 
a true and earnest soul. She sat to him for a pit-lure, and 
he strolled in nearly every evening for music and a social 
chat. How well I remember the long room with its an- 
tique furniture and polished floors, the piano at one end, 
and those two youthful faces smiling, lighting up with a 
word, or joining their voices in some sweet harmony. In 
the centre, the table with its books, papers, and vase of 



SYDNIE ADRIANCE, OR 

flowers, Mrs. Endicott in her great chair, and a group 
gathered around, eagerly discussing art, science, poetry, 
politics, or religion. It was a kind of life nearly perfect in 
its enjoyments, and influenced me in a peculiar manner. 

Although we were not much in society, we had many 
agreeable friends. One evening, I think it was during 
Lent, Mr. Wardleigh brought a young American to call 
upon us. We found him exceedingly entertaining. His 
two sisters had been abroad several years, and he had but 
recently rejoined them. It seemed like a little glimpse of 
my native land, and was the more to me in that he had 
met the "Westervelts, indeed was quite welt acquainted 
with Philip. 

" How really charming you were to Mr. Clifford," Grace 
said, with a gay laugh. " I'm not sure that it is quite 
right to make yourself so fascinating to susceptible young 
men." 

" Neither of us are in any danger, I think," was my grave 
reply. 

" Didn't he make you a trifle homesick with all that talk 
about old friends ? Once or twice there was such a soft, 
strange light in your eyes. I do not want you to be seized 
with a longing for home just yet." 

I started at this, then said that I thought my reign as 
governess would presently come to an end. 

She colored at my retort. 

We had counted strongly on the service of Passion 
Week, and went to the Sistine Chapel every day. I do 
not wonder that the gorgeous ritual wins many admirers. 
It impressed me with a deep feeling of awe. Great pa- 
thetic swells of music, the dim lights, and air cloudy with 
incense, the low-voiced priests and sombre penitential 
robes, have a wonderful power over the imagination and 
feeling in such a place, where sculpture, poetry, and paint- 



 

ing lend their divine power. And yet there must be times 
when nothing but true divinity will satisfy the hungering 
soul. 

I remember glancing over the crowd, and coming to a 
face and figure that riveted my attention instantly. What 
there was about it to affect me so curiously I could not 
tell, unless the long, searching gaze startled me and ren- 
dered me almost nervous. This stranger was either Eng- 
lish or American, tall, thin to emaciation, and deathly pale. 
His hair and beard were snowy white, and the contrast 
with his large, dark, inexpressibly mournful eyes, was in- 
describable. Feeble and aged as he appeared, there was a 
lingering impress of power in every feature. Again and 
again I encountered the look. 

Grace remarked it also, and spoke of it afterwards. 

" lie appeared well-bred, and a gentleman, but he cer- 
tainly did stare. There's something suggestive about his 
face, as if I had seen it under different circumstances," 
she said. 

" It affects me in precisely the same manner," I replied ; 
and though I tried to dismiss it, I found that it still haunt- 
ed me. 

We were in our places the next day, and the unknown 
in his. I began to have a strange presentiment of evil or 
misfortune. Of late I had grown serenely happy; now I 
seemed to have come to the verge of change and danger. 

The pomp of Good Friday was most solemn and im- 
posing. Just before nightfall we went to the chapel. The 
setting sun made a dusky crimson twilight through the 
richly ornamented windows, and at the far chancel the tall 
candles sent their faint rays over the striking scene. After 
the priest read the service, the mournful flow of music 
rolled like great sorrowful waves through the chapel. One 
by one the candles were extinguished. Then a plaintive 



 

voice took up the cry of desolation, touching every heart 
by its exquisite pathos, joined presently by a deep, tremu- 
lous alto, that rendered the sound more like a perfect 
agonizing wail. 

Suddenly another sound broke the devotional fervor: a 
human exclamation of pain or grief. There was a stir in 
the vicinity of our unknown ; indeed he seemed to have 
fallen heavily backward, but in the crowd we could not see 
any further movement. I was nervous, and discomposed ; 
and though the remainder of the service was grand and 
touching, I hardly listened, and was glad to emerge from 
the darkened church into the open air and the lingering 
rays of daylight. We came, singularly enough, upon Mr. 
Clifford, assisting the very person in whom we had become 
so interested. His steps were tottering, and his face like 
death itselfl 

We merely exchanged glances. I was alarmed, and glad 
to find Mr. Endicott waiting for us. 

Grace told the story, she being much calmer than I. 
And that evening, when Mr. Wardleigh came, it was re- 
peated. 

He smiled a little. 

" I think it is Mr. Clifford's uncle, who is an invalid. He 
has quite large expectations from him, I believe. I have 
met the two sisters Mrs. Dorrance and Miss Clifford." 

"And the resemblance we could not account for, is to 
young Mr. Clifford," Grace said, relieved. "Yet there is a 
shadowy suggestion of something that I can't dismiss from 
my mind." 

" We had better dismiss it altogether," I returned. 

" How pale you are, Miss Adriance ! And I'm stupidly 
nervous, for I sec a resemblance in every one to those 
Cliffords, I believe. Just now your eyes had the exact 
expression." 



 

"Tt is oclrl," Mr. "Wardleigh said, "but the first evening 
Clifford was here I couldn't help thinking he looked like 
Miss Adriance. I suppose it was only a whim." 

I went to my room presently, but somehow I could not 
sleep that night. Vague fancies haunted me, out of which 
I could make nothing tangible. I felt glad that we were 
Boon to leave Rome, for I was tiring of its lonely magnifi- 
cence. Indeed, a strange yearning for home came over 
me. 

But my surprise had not reached its climax. The next 
morning, as I sat in my room writing letters, Grace entered 
with a face full of wonder. 

" Mr. Clifford is here, and wishes to see you alone," she 
announced. 

I started at this. " There certainly is some mystery 
about it," she went on. " If his uncle were not old and 
ill " 

" Hush ! " I interrupted, silencing her playful badinage. 
Then I crossed the hall, but paused several seconds at the 
door, steadying my nerves.^ 

Mr. Clifford stood by the centre-table, pale and agitated. 

" You must excuse this unseasonable call," he said, with 
a faint smile; "but it is a work of necessity." 

" Pray be seated," and I placed a chair for him. 

" Miss Adriance," he began, slowly, after quite a pause, 
"I want you to exonerate me from all motives of imperti- 
nence or curiosity. I saw you yesterday as we came out 
of the chapel. I was assisting my uncle, who had been 
ill " 

" Yes," I said, as he waited. 

"I mentioned your name then. It seems he had been 
attracted by a singular resemblance to a person long dead, 
a nephew dearly loved, who married a Miss Adriance. 
I do not know that it can have anything to do with you ; 



 

but he was most anxious to learn your antecedents. Of 
course, if Sidney Clifford had left a child its name would 
not be Adriance." 

The room swam before my eyes. That old tragedy of 
love and death rushed through my brain. Sidney Clifford. 
I remembered that I had inherited my father's Christian 
name; by one of the odd incidents of fate, his family name 
I had never known, for my aunts had made Adriance 
legally mine. Mr. Anthon was probably aware, but he had 
not mentioned it. 

" I must beg your pardon for startling you in this man- 
ner," he continued. ""Uncle has some strange whims 
but Miss Adriance ! " 

He came towards me suddenly. I was not faint, yet I 
gasped for breath. 

"There was a little girl born to Sidney Clifford. This 
is her mother's picture." And he opened a locket. 

I uttered a cry of joy and surprise. My own mother, as 
I had seen her just once. 

" I think he is right. He always supposed the child 
dead, having been so informed. Miss Adriance, we are 
something nearer than friends relatives." 

I was in a maze of bewilderment, and hardly knew what 
to say. Was not the whole affair some idle vision, con- 
jured up by an old man's diseased brain ? But the picture ! 

" Yesterday, overcome by the warmth of the place, the 
power of the music, and perhaps his own feelings, he 
fainted. On leaving the church we met, as you know. 
He begged me to learn your name, and who you were. I 
explained immediately, and then he confessed he had 
watched you for the past week, drawn by some attraction 
it was impossible to resist. Last night he was very ill. 
He blames himself, I believe, for many of the misfortunes 
that befel your parents, and implored me to bring you to 



 

him, if I learned that you were really their child. He will 
tell you the story. I think there can be no doubt. It was 
one of those unfortunate secret marriages, but our main 
facts agree, and as he is all impatience I will not delay by 
further explanations. Will you accompany me thither?" 

I assented, and went to make myself ready, promising 
to satisfy Grace on my return. I hardly knew whether I 
believed or not. And as we were rolling through the nar- 
row street, in spite of the whirl of my brain I fancied that 
it would be -pleasant to find some one on whom I had a 
stronger claim than mere friendship. But how many times 
in my short life I had been cast among utter strangers ! 

I repeated the few facts of my early history to Mr. Clif- 
ford. During the previous night, when his uncle had con- 
sidered himself dying, he had spoken of some matters 
concerning which he had heretofore preserved the utmost 
silence. 

" Of course," Mr. Clifford explained, " he could not 
imagine you were alive. The resemblance certainly is ex- 
traordinary. The first evening that I saw you, you re- 
minded me of my sisters." 

I had always supposed that I resembled my mother's 
family. I had a distinct remembrance of my two aunts, 
and I fancied that as I grew older I looked more like 
them. Was it the peculiar likeness between myself and 
the Cliffords that Grace had unconsciously remarked? 

I was in a chaos of amazement and unbelief, or rather 
that strange sort of fear to which faith appears impossible. 
As if upon examination some conclusive link would be 
wanting, and the whole affair fall to the ground like a 
baseless fabric. 

We arrived at the place presently a lovely, olden- 
time villa, with a terraced garden, and great trees lining 
the carriage way as well as the walk. There was an air 
 



 

about it of going into slow decay, and yet it was exceed- 
ingly lovely. Mr. Clifford led me up the broad arched 
entrance, whose marble floor gave a faint echo to our 
tread. A lady, apparently thirty, tall and elegant in the 
black robe that clung about her with a kind of exquisite 
grace, came to meet us. 

u I have brought her, Bertha," Mr. Clifford said, and 
then followed my introduction to Mrs. Dorrance. Al- 
though stately and commanding, she was very gracious. 

" We owe you some apology for thus startling you with 
a family history," she went on, in a low, sweet tone. " But 
if it is true, as our uncle suspects, we shall endeavor to win 
your pardon by the welcome we shall give you as a 
relative." 

" There can be no doubt about it, Bertha," Mr. Clifford 
said. 

" Will you have Miss Adriance lay aside her bonnet and 
mantle, while I go and prepare uncle ?" 

I understood immediately that I would not be consid- 
ered an intruder, and this gave me courage. Indeed, they 
both appeared so intent upon ministering to their relative 
that the mere influence brought me into the same mood. 
Mrs. Dorrance made a few explanations while her brother 
was absent, but he soon came to conduct me to the sick 
man's apartment. 



 



CHAPTER XXII. 



A CURIOUS awe seized me as I entered the place. The 
lofty ceiling, frescoed walls, heavy crimson curtains that 
made a soft twilight through the room, the antique furni- 
ture and great canopied bed, seemed like a description in a 
story. The lighter appointments of the place I scarcely 
noticed then. As the sense of dimness" cleared away, I 
caught a glimpse of the pale face amid the pillows, and 
started involuntarily. 

" Sydnie Adriance!" he exclaimed, stretching out his 
hand with a majestic wave. "Let her stand there in the 
light, Gorald. My God! how like, and yet unlike. Childj 
come here, and forgive me before I die. I think I mur- 
dered your father ! " 

"Go to him," Gerald Clifford said, in a whisper. 

I approached the bed-side. Something in the face ap- 
pealed powerfully to me. I seemed to lose my own voli- 
tion and be swayed by his desires alone. A motive I 
could not understand impelled me to say, 

" I do not think I have suffered much from the past mis- 
takes of others." 

"Ah, you are generous because you do not know. Ger- 
ald, give me some cordial, and leave me alone with her." 

The young man obeyed, raising his uncle to a sitting 



 

posture, and placing a chair for me. For the first few mo- 
ments the silence was deathly. I glanced at the pallid 
face, so full of lines, the sunken yet strangely pathetic 
eyes, and the trembling hand grasping the counterpane for 
even that frail support. 

" You don't know." The voice was weak and wander- 
ing. " If he could have given you a father's love and 
care " 

That touched me. I had never known neglect so far as 
my bodily wants were concerned, but the sweetness, the 
tenderness most children have by right of a blessed inheri- 
tance had fallen out of my life, leaving waste and desolate 
places. 

" I want to hear your story," he said, presently. " I 
shall be better able to tell mine then." 

I began with my earliest recollections, which were 
scarcely beyond that first conversation concerning my 
father. After that my guardian's visit and my first school 
experience ; but at the death of my aunts I paused. 

"Go on," he said, with some difficulty. " I want to hear 
all about this life that I might have made so much 
better." 

I went briefly over the succeeding years my school 
life, my introduction to the world, my subsequent loss of 
fortune, and the years since, with their varied incidents. 

He had grown strangely interested. Through the latter 
part his eyes had scarcely wandered from my face. I 
marvelled that I should be able to talk with so little re- 
serve, but I could see that it pleased him better. Every 
moment a strong, yearning sympathy drew me nearer to 
him. 

"My poor child! If I could have known of your ex- 
istence years ago, Heaven will bear me witness that I 
would have given you the tenderest care. It was I who 



 

visited your aunt, and she told me you were dead. I 
might have made inquiries elsewhere, but I could riot sus- 
pect her of any motive for deception, though I could see 
that she cherished the most bitter hatred towards your 
father, even in his grave. Both of us sinned in our self- 
ish love for the one nearest to us. Can it ever be for- 
given ? " 

A strong impulse led me to clasp my hand over the 
thin white fingers. It was returned with trembling pres- 
sure. 

" I must go back to my own early life to make you un- 
derstand why I loved your father so well. There were 
two brothers of us, all that were left of a large family. 
Arnold and I were inseparable, and yet we were very dis- 
similar. He had a girl's delicacy and fastidiousness, while 
I was a great strong fellow, able to take life at its hardest 
or its worst. Why linger*'over that episode? We both 
loved the same woman, or rather child, a girl so fair, so 
pure and lovely in soul as well as in body, that all other 
women failed by comparison. I fancied she loved me in 
return ; and I watched with keenest eyes, quickened, per- 
haps, by all I had at stake. With Arnold she was shy 
and reserved, I thought, shunned rather than sought him, 
while she caine to me with so winsome a freedom that I 
laid my whole soul at her feet. Blind dolt that I was, not 
to see ! feut my passion absorbed sight and sense. One 
night Arnold came to me, his face fairly transfigured with 
delight, and his voice tremulous with joy. Muriel loved 
him, had confessed it, and promised to become his wife. 
In that moment I was plunged into the blackness and 
depth of despair. I could have cried out weakly in my 
agony, but for his sake I held my peace. But the torture 
of the next few weeks I cannot describe. Even now it 
comes back fresh and poignant. Muriel was so uncon- 



 

sciously sweet and sisterly. I knew then that my own 
blindness had misled me." 

He made so long a pause that I looked at him in distress. 
Each respiration was labored and painful. 

"You will injure yourself," I exclaimed, apprehen- 
sively. 

"I have lived these scenes over continually during the 
last twenty-four hours. Life is nearly gone what does 
it matter ? " 

What could I say ? I cast about for some comfort, but 
none came. 

" I could not stay to see them married. I happened to 
meet with a fine opening in a mercantile house connected 
with the China trade, and I resolved to go abroad. I 
spent nine years there, and amassed a fortune, added to 
the small one I had inherited. Then I set out upon a tour 
through all the wonderful countries of the old world 
India, Persia, Arabia, and Egypt. I had reached the 
shores of Greece when I received word from JMuriel. 
Arnold had died suddenly; and in one of the periodic 
financial convulsions nearly everything had been swept 
away. I had an abundance for them all, and I hurried 
back to my native land. I found Muriel lovelier than 
ever, but in a fatal decline. She grieved continually for 
her husband. I never saw deeper or truer devotion. 

"There were two children, Sidney, the younger, named 
for me. There was a peculiar blending of father and 
mother in him ; he had her soft dark eyes, and her almost 
heavenly smile, with all his father's delicacy of figure and 
constitution. From the first hour I took him to my heart. 
Richard, the elder, was proud, ambitious, and energetic, 
the kind of boy that appeals so strongly to the pride of 
most men ; but Sidney I loved with a strange, tender 
passion. 



 

w "Well, Muriel died. She never knew my secret here 
upon earth, and in heaven the angels are pitiful. I took 
her children as my own. Richard prospered, and grew 
into a noble manhood. I settled him in business, and saw 
him married. Bertha, Gerald, and Alice, whom you have 
not seen, are his children. He, too, died young. 

" Perhaps I was blind in my partiality for Sidney. I 
do not mean that I was ever ungenerous to Dick ; but upon 
the younger I lavished all my love. He was so fond and 
clinging, so affectionate! O, why did I allow this sweet, 
fond heart to stray from me ? 

"One summer he was barely twenty, and just through 
college he took a fancy to ramble around with some 
young companions, as I thought. I had always supplied 
him liberally with money, and he really had no idea of its 
value. In most things he was a child. He met your 
mother, and the two fell headlong in love. After a while he 
wrote, confessing his attachment; and as she had been 
subject to what he considered a very cruel persecution on 
the part of her friends, he proposed to marry her imme- 
diately, and bring her home. 

"And now comes my own bitter, humiliating confes- 
sion. My jealous, absorbing love was goaded to madness* 
To lose him, to have another come between, and see him 
lavish upon her the boundless wealth of his affection ! He 
was mine in a peculiar sense. I had given up his mother; 
but I would not relinquish him. I wrote, and com- 
manded him to renounce his boyish folly, and return 
home at once. I blamed the girl as a designing schemer, 
and refused uttei-ly to see her or receive her. 

"My letter was delayed on its way; and when it 
reached him, Miss Adriance was already his wife, having 
clandestinely left her relatives. I was merciless in my 
anger, and his very tenderness for his bride exasperated 



 

me. I took a savage delight in announcing that lie Irim- 
self had made the rupture between us; that he had proved 
weak, fickle, and ungrateful ; and henceforth he need not 
look to me for assistance. Since he had chosen her, he 
must abide by his fate. Henceforward we would be utter 
strangers. 

"Richard was provoked with his imprudent marriage 
also. Sidney begged him to intercede, that he might be 
restored to my favor ; but I would not listen to a word 
in his behalf. For more than a year we heard nothing 
from him. I had been away several weeks on some busi- 
ness; and when I returned, my housekeeper met me with 
a strange story. Sidney had arrived one evening looking 
so ill and worn, and so disappointed at my absence, that 
she had asked him in. He would eat nothing, but begged 
to be allowed the privilege of going to his old room once 
more. At midnight, hearing a stir within, she had entered 
his room, and found him in a wild delirium. That was 
four days before, and he had alternated between fever 
and stupor ever since. The physicians despaired of his 
life. 

" I was stunned by the tidings, and went immediately 
to him. My darling but O, how changed ! Worn to a 
skeleton, the thin cheeks a flame of scarlet fire, the soft 
eyes glared with the fever that was consuming him. All 
my love rushed back in an instant. I would have given 
my life to save him. Alas ! repentance everything was 
too late ! On the ninth day he died. I was holding him 
in my arms, and I know a faint gleam of consciousness 
overspread his soul. With one bright, glad smile his spirit 
went heavenward. 

" For weeks I was plunged into a profound and pas- 
sionate grief. I scarcely slept, or ate, or thought. I had 
ordered a brief letter despatched to your mother; but my 



? 

tieart was^ still bitter and unjust towards her. I blamed 
her for all that had occurred. If she had displayed any 
judgment she would not have rushed upon this evil mar- 
riage. I laid Sidney's death at her door. 

" Some time afterwards, in looking over a long unused
