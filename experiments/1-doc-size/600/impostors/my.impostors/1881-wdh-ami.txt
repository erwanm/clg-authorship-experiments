ought to have been away weeks ago, but this Indigent 
Surf-Bathing has kept me. You 've no idea what 
such an undertaking is. But you must let me have 
your address, and as soon as I get back to town ia 



 

the fall, I shall insist upon looking you up. Good 
by ! I must run away, now, and leave you ; there are 
a thousand things for me to look after yet to-day." 
She took Marcia again by the hand, and superadded 
some bows and nods and smiles of parting, after she 
released her, but she did not ask her to come into the 
committee-room and have some coffee; and Bartley 
took his wife 's hand under his arm and went out 
of the hall. 

" Well," he said, with a man 's simple pleasure in 
Miss Kingsbury 's friendliness to his wife, " that 's the 
girl I used to tell you about, the rich one with the 
money in her own right, whom I met at the Hallecks . 
She seemed to think you were about the thing, Marsh ! 
I saw her eyes open as she came up, and I felt 
awfully proud of you ; you never looked half so well. 
But why didn 't you say something ? " 

" She didn 't give me any chance," said Marcia, 
"and I had nothing to say, anyway. I thought she 
was very disagreeable." 

" Disagreeable ! " repeated Bartley in amaze. 

Miss Kingsbury went back to the committee-room, 
where one of the amateurs had been lecturing upon 
her : " Clara Kingsbury can say and do, from the best 
heart in the world, more offensive things in ten min 
utes than malice could invent in a week. Somebody 
ought to go out and drag her away from that reporter 
by main force. But I presume it 's too late already ; 
she 's had time to destroy us all. You ll see that 
there won 't be a shred left of us in his paper at any 
rate. Really, I wonder that, in a city full of nervous 
and exasperated people like Boston, Clara Kingsbury 
has been suffered to live. She throws her whole soul 
into everything she undertakes, and she has gone so 
en masse into this Indigent Bathing, and splashed 
about in it so, that I can 't understand how we got 
anybody to come to-day. Why, I haven 't the least 



 

doubt that she 's offered that poor man a ticket to 
go down to Nantasket and bathe with the other In- 
digents ; she 's treated me as if I ought to be person 
ally surf-bathed for the last fortnight ; and if there 's 
any chance for us left by her tactlessness, you may 
be sure she 's gone at it with her conscience and 
simply swept it off the face of the earth." 



 



XVIII. 

ONE hot day in August, when Bartley had been 
doing nothing for a week, and Marcia was gloomily 
forecasting the future when they would have to begin 
living upon the money they had put into the savings 
bank, she reverted to the question of his taking up 
the law again. She was apt to recur to this in any 
moment of discouragement, and she urged him now 
to give up his newspaper work with that wearisome 
persistence with which women torment the men they 
love. 

" My newspaper work seems to have given me up, 
my dear," said Bartley. " It 's like asking a fellow 
not to marry a girl that won 't have him." He laughed 
and then whistled ; and Marcia burst into fretful, 
futile tears, which he did not attempt to assuage. 

They had been all summer in town ; the country 
would have been no change to them ; and they knew 
nothing of the seaside except the crowded, noisy, 
expensive resorts near the city. Bartley wished her 
to go to one of these for a week or two, at any rate, 
but she would not ; and in fact neither of them had 
the born citizen 's conception of the value of a sum 
mer vacation. But they had found their attic in 
tolerable ; and, the single gentlemen having all given 
up their rooms by this time, Mrs. Nash let Marcia 
have one lower down, where they sat looking out on 
the hot street. 

"Well," cried Marcia at last, "you don 't care for 
my feelings, or you would take up the law again." 



 

Her husband rose with a sigh that was half a 
curse, and went out. After what she had said, he 
would not give her the satisfaction of knowing what 
he meant to do ; but he had it in his head to go to 
that Mr. Atherton to whom Miss Kingsbury had 
introduced him, and ask his advice ; he had found 
out that Mr. Atherton was a lawyer, and he believed 
that he would tell him what to do. He could at least 
give him some authoritative discouragement which 
he might use in these discussions with Marcia. 

Mr. Atherton had his office in the Events building, 
and Bartley was on his way thither when he met 
Kicker. 

"Seen Witherby?" asked his friend. "He was 
round looking for you." 

" What does Witherby want with me ? " asked 
Bartley, with a certain resentment. 

" Wants to give you the managing-editorship of 
the Events," said Eicker, jocosely. 

" Pshaw ! Well, he knows where to find me. if he 
wants me very badly." 

" Perhaps he does n t," suggested Eicker. " In that 
case, you d better look him up." 

" Why, you don 't advise " 

" Oh, I don 't advise anything ! But if lie can let 
bygones be bygones, I guess you can afford to ! I 
don 't know just what he wants with you, but if lie 
offers you anything like a basis, you d better take it." 

Bartley 's basis had come to be a sort of by-word 
between them; Eicker usually met him with som&lt;&gt; 
such demand as, " Well, what about the basis ? " 
or, " How 's your poor basis ? " Bartley 's ardor for a 
salaried position amused him, and lie often tried to 
argue him out of it. "You 're much better off as a 
free lance. You make as much money as most of 
the fellows in places, and you lead a pleasanter life. 
If you were on any one paper, you d have to be on 



 

duty about fifteen hours out of the twenty-four ; 
you d be out every night till three or four o clock ; 
you d have to do fires, and murders, and all sorts of 
police business ; and now you work mostly on fancy 
jobs, something you suggest yourself, or something 
you 're specially asked to do. That 's a kind of a 
compliment, and it gives you scope." 

Nevertheless, if Bartley had his heart set upon a 
basis, Bicker wanted him to have it. "Of course," 
he said, " I was only joking about the basis. But if 
Witherby should have something permanent to offer, 
don 't quarrel with your bread and butter, and don 't 
hold yourself too cheap. Witherby 's going to get all 
he can, for as little as he can, every time." 

Ricker was a newspaper man in every breath. His 
great interest in life was the Chronicle-Abstract, 
which paid him poorly and worked him hard. To get 
in ahead of the other papers was the object for which 
he toiled with unremitting zeal ; but after that he 
liked to see a good fellow prosper, and he had for 
Bartley that feeling of comradery which comes out 
among journalists when their rivalries are off. He 
would hate to lose Bartley from the Chronicle- 
Abstract ; if Witherby meant business, Bartley and 
he might be excoriating each other before a week 
passed in sarcastic references to " our esteemed con 
temporary of the Events," and " our esteemed contem 
porary of the Chronicle- Abstract " ; but he heartily 
wished him luck, and hoped it might be some sort 
of inside work. 

When Bicker left him Bartley hesitated. He was 
half minded to go home and wait for Witherby to 
look him up, as the most dignified and perhaps the 
most prudent course. But he was curious and im 
patient, and he was afraid of letting the chance, 
whatever it might be, slip through his fingers. He 
suddenly resolved upon a little ruse, which would 



still oblige Witherby to make the advance, and yet 
would risk nothing by delay. He mounted to Wither- 
by 's room in the Events building, and pushed open 
the door. Then he drew back, embarrassed, as if he 
had made a mistake. "Excuse me," he said, " isn 't 
Mr. Atherton 's office on this floor ? " 

Witherby looked up from the papers on his desk, 
and cleared his throat. When he overreached him 
self he was apt to hold any party to the transaction 
accountable for his error. Ever since he refused 
Hartley 's paper on the logging-camp, he had accused 
him in his heart of fraud because he had sold the 
rejected sketch to another paper, and anticipated 
Witherby 's tardy enterprise in the same direction. 
Each little success that Bartley made added to 
Witherby 's dislike ; and whilst Bartley had written 
for all the other papers, he had never got any work 
from the Events. Witherby had the guilty sense 
of having hated him as he looked up, and Bartley 
on his part was uneasily sensible of some mocking 
paragraphs of a more or less personal cast, which 
he had written in the Chronicle-Abstract, about the 
enterprise of the Events. 

" Mr. Atherton is on the floor above," said Wither- 
by. " But I in very glad you happened to look in, 
Mr. Hubbard. I I was just thinking about you. 
Ah wont you take a chair ? " 

" Thanks," said Bartley, non-committally ; but he 
sat down in the chair which the other rose to offer him. 

Witherby fumbled about among the tilings on hi* 
desk before lie resumed his own seat. " I hope you 
have been well since I saw you ? " 

" Oh, yes, I'm always well. How have you been ? " 
Bartley wondered whither this exchange of civilities 
tended ; but he believed he could keep it up as lung 
as old Witherby could. 

" Why, I have not been very well," said Witherby, 



 

getting into his chair, and taking up a paper-weight 
to help him in talk. " The fact is, I find that I 
have been working too hard. I have undertaken to 
manage the editorial department of the JCveiits in 
addition to looking after its business, and the care 
has been too great. It has told upon me. I flatter 
myself that I have not allowed either department to 
suffer " 

He referred this point so directly to him, that 
Bartley made a murmur of assent, and Witherby 
resumed. 

" But the care has told upon me. I am not so well 
as I could wish. I need rest, and I need help," he 
added. 

Bartley had by this time made up his mind that, if 
Witherby had anything to say to him, he should say 
it unaided. 

Witherby put down the paper-weight, and gave 
his attention for a moment to a paper-cutter. " I 
don 't know whether you have heard that Mr. Clayton 
is going to leave us ? " 

" No," Bartley said, " I hadn 't heard that." 
" Yes, he is going to leave us. Mr. Clayton and 
I have not agreed upon some points, and we have 
both judged it best that we should part." Witherby 
paused again, and changed the positions of his ink 
stand and mucilage-bottle. " Mr. Clayton has failed 
me, as I may say, at the last moment, and we have 
been compelled to part. I found Mr. Clayton 
unpractical." 

He looked again at Bartley, who said, " Yes ? " 
"Yes. I found Mr. Clayton so much at variance 
in his views with with my own views that I 
could do nothing with him. He has used language 
to me which I am sure lie will regret. But that is 
neither here nor there , he is going. I have had my 
eye on you, Mr. Hubbard, ever since you came to 



 

Boston, and have watched your career with interest. 
But I thought of Mr. Clayton, in the first instance, 
he cause he was already attached to the Events, and I 
wished to promote him. Office during good behavior, 
and promotion in the direct line : I 'm thai much of a 
civil-service reformer," said Witherby. 
" Certainly," said Hartley. 

" But of course my idea in starting the Events 
was to make money." 
" Of course." 

" I hold that the first duty of a public journal is 
to make money for the owner ; all the rest follows 
naturally." 

" You 're quite right, Mr. Witherby," said Bartley. 
" Unless it makes money, there can he no enterprise 
about it, no independence, nothing. That was the 
way I did with my little paper down in Maine. The 
first thing I told the committee when I took hold 
of the paper is to keep it from losing money; the 
next is to make money with it. First peaceable, then 
pure : that 's what I told them." 

" Precisely so ! " Witherby was now so much at 
his ease with Bartley that he left off tormenting the 
things on his desk, and used his hands in gesticu 
lating. "Look at the churches themselves: Xo 
church can do any good till it 's on a paying basis. 
As long as a church is in debt, it can 't secure the 
best talent for the pulpit or the choir, and the 
members go about feeling discouraged and out of 
heart. It 's just so with a newspaper. I say that 
a paper does no good till it pays ; it has no influ 
ence, its motives are always suspected, and you 've 
got to make it pay by hook or by crook, before you 
can hope to to forward any good cause by it. 
That 's what I say. Of course," he added, in a large, 
smooth way, " I in not going to contend that a 
newspaper should be run soldid in the interest of 



 

the counting-room. Not at all ! But I do -contend 
that, when the counting-room protests against a cer 
tain course the editorial room is taking, it ought to be 
respectfully listened to. There are always two sides 
to every question. Suppose all the newspapers pitch 
i n as they sometimes do and denounce a certain 
public enterprise : a projected scheme of railroad 
legislation, or a peculiar system of banking, or a 
co-operative mining interest, and the counting-room 
sends up word that the company advertises heavily 
with us ; shall we go and join indiscriminately in that 
hue and cry, or shall we give our friends the benefit 
of the doubt ? " 

"Give them the benefit of the doubt," answered 
Bartley. " That 's what I say." 

" And so would any other practical man ! " said 
Witherby. "And that 's just where Mr. Clayton 
and I differed. Well, I needn 't allude to him any 
more," he added leniently. "What I wish to say 
is this, Mr. Hubbard. I am overworked, and I feel 
the need of some sort of relief. I know that I have 
started the Events in the right line at last, the 
only line in which it can be made a great, useful, and 
respectable journal, efficient in every good cause, 
and what I want now is some sort of assistant 
in the management who shall be in full sympathy 
with my own ideas. I don 't want a mere slave, a 
tool ; but I do want an independent, right-minded 
man, who shall be with me for the success of the 
paper the whole time and every time, and shall not 
be continually setting up his will against mine on 
all sorts of doctrinaire points. That was the trouble 
with Mr. Clayton. I have nothing against Mr. Clay 
ton personally ; he is an excellent young man in 
very many respects ; but he was all wrong about 
journalism, all wrong, Mr. Hubbard. I talked with 
him a great deal, and tried to make him see where 



 

his interest lay. He had been on the paper as a 
reporter from the start, and I wished very much to 
promote him to this position ; which he could have 
made the best position in the country. The Events 
is an evening paper ; there is no night-work ; and the 
whole thing is already thoroughly systematized. Mr. 
Clayton had plenty of talent, and all he had to do 
was to step in under my direction and put his hand 
on the helm. But, no ! I should have been glad to 
keep him in a subordinate capacity ; but I had to let 
him go. He said that he would not report the con 
flagration of a peanut-stand for a paper conducted on 
the principles I had developed to him. Now, that 
is no way to talk. It 's absurd." 

"Perfectly." Bartley laughed his rich, caressing 
laugh, in which there was the insinuation of all 
worldly-wise contempt for Clayton and all worldly- 
wise sympathy with Witherby. It made Witherby 
feel good, better perhaps than he had felt at any 
time since his talk with Clayton. 

" Well, now, what do you say, Mr. Hubbard ? 
Can 't we make some arrangement with you ? " he 
asked, with a burst of frankness. 

" I guess you can," said Bartley. The fact that 
Witherby needed him was so plain that he did not 
care to practise any finesse about the matter. 

" What are your present engagements ? " 

" I haven 't any." 

" Then you can take hold at once ? " 

" Yes." 

" That 's good ! " Witherby now entered at large 
into the nature of the position which he offered 
Bartley. They talked a long time, and in becoming 
better acquainted with each other 's views, as they 
called them, they became better friends. Bartley 
began to respect Witherby 's business ideas, and 
Witherby in recognizing all the admirable qualities 



 

of this clear-sighted and level-headed young man be 
gan to feel that he had secretly liked him from the 
first, and had only waited a suitable occasion to un 
mask his affection. It was arranged that Bartley 
should come on as Witherby 's assistant, and should 
do whatever he was asked to do in the management 
of the paper; he was to write on topics as they 
occurred to him, or as they were suggested to him. 
" I don 't say whether this will lead to anything 
more, Mr. Hubbard, or not ; but I do say that you 
will be in the direct line of promotion." 

" Yes, I understand that," said Bartley. 

"And now as to terms," continued Witherby, a 
little tremulously. 

" And now as to terms," repeated Bartley to him 
self; but he said nothing aloud. He felt that Witherby 
had cut out a great deal of work for him, and work 
of a kind that he could not easily find another man 
both willing and able to do. He resolved that lie 
would have all that his service was worth. 

"What should you think of twenty dollars a 
week ? " asked Witherby. 

" I shouldn 't think it was enough," said Bartley, 
amazed at his own audacity, but enjoying it, and 
thinking how he had left Marcia with the intention 
of offering himself to Mr. Atherton as a clerk for ten 
dollars a week. " There is a great deal of labor in 
what you propose, and you command my whole time. 
You would not like to have me do any work outside 
of the Events." 

"No," Witherby assented. "Would twenty-five 
be nearer the mark ? " he inquired soberly. 

" It would be nearer, certainly," said Bartley. " But 
I guess you had better make it thirty." He kept a 
quiet face, but his heart throbbed. 

" Well, say thirty, then," replied Witherby so 
promptly that Bartley perceived with a pang that he 

 



 

might as easily have got forty from him. But it was 
now too late, and a salary of fifteen hundred a year 
passed the wildest hopes he had cherished half an 
hour before. 

" All right," he said quietly. " I suppose you want 
me to take hold at once ? " 

" Yes,_ on Monday. Oh, by the way," said Witherby, 
" there is one little piece of outside work which I 
should like you to finish up for us ; and we 'll  agree 
upon something extra for it, if you wish. I mean 
our Solid Men series. I don 't know whether you Ve 
noticed the series in the Events ? " 

" Yes," said Bartley, " I have." 

" Well, then, you know what they are. They con 
sist of interviews guarded and inoffensive as respects 
the sanctity of private life with our leading manu 
facturers and merchant princes at their places of 
business and their residences, and include a descrip 
tion of these, and some account of the lives of the 
different subjects." 

"Yes, I have seen them," said Bartley. "I 've 
noticed the general plan." 

" You know that Mr. Clayton has been doing them. 
He made them a popular feature. The parties them 
selves were very much pleased with them." 

" Oh, people are always tickled to be interviewed," 
said Bartley. " I know they put on airs about it, and 
go round complaining to each other about the viola 
tion of confidence, and so on ; but they all like it. 
You know I reported that Indigent Surf-Bathing 
entertainment in June for the Chronicle-Abstract 
I knew the lady who got it up, and I interviewed 
her after the entertainment." 

" Miss Kiugsbury ? " 

" Yes." Witherby made an inarticulate murmur 
of respect for Bartley in his throat, and involun 
tarily changed toward him, but not so subtly that 



 

Bartley 's finer instinct did not take note of the change. 
"She was a fresh subject, and she told me everything. 
Of course I printed it all. She was awfully shocked, 
or pretended to be, and wrote me a very O-dear-how- 
could-you note about it. But I went round to the 
office the next day, and I found that nearly every 
lady mentioned in the interview had ordered half a 
dozen copies of that issue sent to her seaside address, 
and the office had been full of Beacon Street swells 
all the morning buying Chronicle- Abstracts, - the 
one with the report of the Concert in it. " These 
low views of high society, coupled with an apparent 
familiarity with it, modified Witherby more and more. 
He began to see that he had got a prize. " The way 
to do with such fellows as your Solid Men," continued 
Bartley, " is to submit a proof to em. They never 
know exactly what to do about it, and so you print 
the interview with their approval, and make em 
particeps crirninis. I 'll  finish up the series for you, 
and I won 't make any very heavy extra charge." 

" I should wish to pay you whatever the work was 
worth," said Witherby, not to be outdone in nobleness. 

"All right; we shan 't quarrel about that, at any 
rate." 

Bartley was getting toward the door, for he was 
eager to be gone now to Marcia, but Witherby fol 
lowed him up as if willing to detain him. "My 
wife," he said, " knows Miss Kiugsbury. They have 
been on the same charities together." 

" I met her a good while ago, when I was visiting 
a chum of mine at his father 's house here. I didn 't 
suppose she d know me ; but she did at once, and 
began to ask me if I was at the Hallecks as if I had 
never gone a\vay." 

" Mr. Ezra B. Halleck ? " inquired Witherby rever 
ently. " Leather trade ? " 

" Yes," said Bartley. " I believe his first name was 



 

Ezra. Ben Halleck was my friend. Do you know 
the family ? " asked Bartley. 

" Yes, we have met them in society. I hope 
you 're pleasantly situated where you are, Mr. Hub- 
bard ? Should be glad to have you call at the 
house." 

" Thank you," said Bartley, " my wife will be glad 
to have Mrs. Witherby call."
