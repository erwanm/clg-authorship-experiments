I throw up the sash it meets me with a sort of 
love-greeting. It is so; I take it so. Do not all 
the Lord's works bring messages to us? This mes 
sage comes specially sweet at this time ; for I think 
of last April, and I remember the weary struggle 
of mind I went through afterwards. Now it is 
over. My old peace has come back again, firmer 
than ever. I "have known and believed the love 
that God hath to us"; and Spring seems to tell 
me of it, repeating it again and again with her 
sweet breath, every time I open the window. It 
is the only time she gets a chance, for I cannot
leave Mrs. Bowdoin long enough to take even a 
very short walk. 



Tune 1. 

I HAVE had no chance to write for many days. 
The sickness developed into what the doctor 
hfid feared, and was a very serious case. There 
was more to do every day, and every night, than 
I could do without the concentration of all my 
energies; and after the worst danger was over I 
was too weary to write. I am very weary still. 
Every two hours the medicine; every two and a 
half hours the beef tea, by day and by night, at 
the minute ; all the time the care of the fires and 
ventilation, till fires ceased to be needed, though 
the ventilation became more imperative; the daily 



 

changing of beds and linen; the daily bathing, and 
ordering of Mrs. Bowdoin's long hair; directions to 
the servants, and keeping up the supply of beef 
tea, on which so much depended; my wits were at 
full strain and my nerves, all the while. Danger 
was present for many weeks; I knew it, but I had 
good hope nevertheless; and at last the disease 
took a turn for life, and Mrs. Bowdoin began again 
to be conscious of what went on around her. And 
then, presently, she began to desire food. That 
was a joyful change, from having to almost force 
her to swallow the beef tea. It is delightful to 
prepare eatables instead of medicine ; but it keeps 
one almost as busy. However, I could throw myself down on the lounge between whiles and look 
at Mrs. Bowdoin; and she lay in her bed and looked 
at me. Talking was beyond both of us. Now, for 
some days, she has been sitting up a little while 
every day. The spring has marched on in the 
mean time, and marched off, and here is summer; 
and we have windows open sometimes for hours, 
without need of fires to keep up the temperature. 
But cold days come still between such days. 



June 20. 

THE cold days are heard of no more, and windows are open all the while. Roses are even 

blossoming, and I am still here. In truth Mrs. 

Bowdoin will not let me go. Until quite lately 



 

my ministrations to her have continued; for she 
had to come back very gradually to ways of health, 
and has not yet ventured down stairs. 

We have it very lovely however up in her dress 
ing room. My own room opens out of it; so I 
am always at hand; and Mrs. Bowdoin's dressing 
room is a charming place ; fitted up for cosy enjoy 
ment, with every sort of pretty and pleasant thing. 
There, with the windows open upon the roses in. 
the garden, we sit and read or talk and I work 
sometimes; but indeed I do network much; and 
instead, sit with my hands before me oftener than 
I ever did in my life before. It seems, that as 
Mrs. Bowdoin's strength has come back, mine has 
gone away. Natural, I suppose, after these weeks. 
And to be sure, I had not been long out of other 
sick rooms at Chesterfield before I was called to 
hers. 

To-day we were sitting so. The windows were 
open, and the scent of roses was pouring in and 
coming too from a great vase behind us on the ta 
ble. Mrs. Bowdoin sat looking at me, and I was 
looking out of the window idly. 

"Desire Burgoyne," she began abruptly in her 
old manner, " why were you never married ? " 

I turned to her and I believe smiled. "Mrs. Bow 
doin," I said, "don't you think such things are in 
the Lord's hands?" 

" All things," returned Mrs. Bowdoin quickly. 
 But in our hands too. Haven't we something 
to do with it?" 

" I have not had anything to do with it," I said. 

" I don't believe that ! " she returned. " Desire, 
do you know what a handsome woman you are?" 

I made no reply, and she went on. "You are; 
you are too good for the men, that is the truth. I 
don't know one that is fit to hold a candle to you ; 
unless" she paused. "Don't you mean ever to be 
married, Desire?" 

" I think not, Mrs. Bowdoin." 

"Why not?" 

".Mrs. Bowdoin, I shall be thirty years old this 
summer, if I live a little longer." 

"Nonsense. And you look about twenty; only 
for a certain something in your face," she said 
slowly, " which is not age at all, nor fatigue, 
though you have almost killed yourself waiting 
on me; and I do not know what it is, only it is 
what one never sees in twenty years old. But it is 
lovelier than anything one can see in twenty years 
old. I should think" she went on, considering 
me, " I should think, you had some particular 
friends among the angels, and were accustomed 
to receive visits from them. Like Adam and Eve 
in Milton's Paradise." 

"I have better than that," I answered with a 
little laughter; "I have the Lord himself; like 
Adam and Eve in the Bible Paradise." 

"What do you mean?" she said sharply. 

" Just what I say, Mrs. Bowdoin." 

"You talk in riddles." 

"I do not mean it. Will you open your Bible 



 

there, at the fourteenth chapter of John, and read 
the twenty-first verse? Do you see the words, 
will manifest myself to him ? and a little further on, ive will come to him ? That is a few verses below." 

" I never could attach any meaning whatever to 
those Avords," she answered. "Not distinctly, I 
mean." 

"They are true," said I. 

"Desire, I am afraid you are a little bit what 
shall I call it? extravagant; enthusiastic." 

"Why?" 

" I cannot give reasons for everything, like you. 
But I am not unreasonable, nevertheless. Desire, I 
want to make a bargain with you." 

"What is it?" 

" Will you make a bargain with me ? " 

" If I like the terms " I said smiling. 

" Do, Desire ! My heart is set on it. I have been 
thinking about it as I lay in bed, and thinking 
about it as I sat here, for days and weeks." 

I saw the water come into Mrs. Bowdoin's eyes. 
Wherewith I grew curious, and looked expectant. 

" I want you to come and live with me." 

" What am I doing ? " I said smiling. " It seems 
to me I am living with you." 

" I mean for ever ; for good. I want you for 
all the rest of my life. Desire, would that be hard 
for you? You are alone in the world. And I do 
not mean it as pay; but at my death I will leave 
you all I have. I will do it because there is no 
body else I would so well like to leave it to as you." 



 

" Thank you ! " said I, feeling a good deal sur 
prised and touched. 

"Thank me for what? I have not done any 
thing yet. Desire, will you come ? " 

She waited anxiously for my answer, but I could 
not give it at once. 

" What are you thinking of? " she asked impa 
tiently. 

" Trying to weigh things," I said. 

" What things ? " 

" Duties." 

" What duties ? You owe no duty to any liv 
ing soul in the world. You can follow your own 
pleasure." 

" If it were a mere question of abstract pleasure," 
I said, " it would be soon settled. Life here with 
you would be far easier than life alone in my own 
house." 

" This shall be your own house," she repeated. 

" Yes," said I ; " that is very kind of you. But 
that is not all." 

"What else is there, Desire?" 

" Dear Mrs. Bowdoin, I heard it said a great 
while ago, and I have never forgotten it, that 
* Life is, to do the will of God. The real question 
for me is, where I can do most work, or be of 
most use." 

"Why here, of course, with more means to do 
everything," she said watching me. 

" Money isn't all," I said shaking my head. "You 
don't know how much in Chesterfield seems to depend on me. And how do I know," I added smil 
ing, u whether my head could stand so much ease, 
and so much of what the world calls prosperity ? " 

" Desire, that is all simple nonsense. Tell me you 
will come, and be my child ! " 

"I will think about it, Mrs. Bowdoin," I said 
kissing her. 

"Where did you get that sentence from, that 
you quoted just now ? " she asked after a minute. 

I believe I hesitated a quarter of a second, wish 
ing I had not quoted it; but I had to answer, 

" I heard Mr. Iredell say it once." 

" It sounds like him. What is he doing with 
himself?" she asked after another pause. 

"Doing? Mr. Iredell? What he always did, I 
suppose." 

" Do you never hear from him ? " 

" Never ! How should I ? " 

" The post carries letters still," she said shortly. 

"Yes, but there is nothing now that he should 
write to rne about." 

" Does Caroline speak of him ? " 

"No; not at all." 

"Then you do not know how he bears his loss?" 

"No. But he is sure to bear it like a good man." 

" Do you know," said Mrs. Bowdoin, " good men 
are great geese sometimes ? " 

With that she broke off the conversation ; and I 
wondered greatly what she could mean. 



 

July 6. 

I GAVE a good many thoughts to Mrs. Bowdoin a 
proposition. She wisely let the subject alone, 
and I pondered it; but I believe, the more I pondered the deeper I got in perplexity. There is 
plenty to be urged on the side of her wish ; she is 
alone, and I am alone in the world; each of us would 
enjoy being with the other and belonging to the 
other. yes, it is rather a sorrowful thing to be 
long to nobody. Pleasure is all on that side of the 
question. The ease of life would be a very differ 
ent thing here with means, from what it is in 
Chesterfield with next to none. Things that I 
like are to be had here and done here; things I 
can enjoy very little at home, or hardly at all. And 
with plenty of money, how much is possible ! I 
should have plenty; and at Mrs. Bowdoin's death, 
if I outlive her, I should have the whole. But 
after all, would my work and influence here tell 
for as much as it does in Chesterfield? There it 
tells for a good deal; I know it does; in the Sunday school, in the Teachers meeting, in the mis 
sionary work, in the neighbourhood generally. 
And can I be sure, that if I were transplanted into 
these luxurious circumstances, I should keep true 
to my ministry? free from the insidious, creeping 
influence of custom and use around me? I nriyltt, 
for Mr. Iredell does; but have I any business to 
choose voluntarily a position of trial ? If it is
chosen for one, that is another matter. It all 



 

comes back to the question, where can I do most 
work for my Master? and I do not yet see the 
decision. 

Meanwhile a previous step has been made neces 
sary, which may perhaps lead me to see better 
about the taking of that one. It is the Lord's way 
to lead us one step at a time; so after I have taken 
this first, I hope I shall be in condition to take the 
next intelligently. 

We were sitting together, Mrs. Bowdoin and I, 
yesterday morning. Not in her dressing room 
this time, but down stairs in the hall ; her recovery 
has got so far. Both doors were open, to let all 
the air through that would come, for the day was 
extremely warm; and with the breeze came also 
a perfect wealth of summer sounds and summer 
scents and colouring. A glimmer from green foliage steeped in sunlight; a glitter from white 
lthe s; brilliant pendants of gold hanging from a 
laburnum just opposite the door; the flicker of 
butterflies wings, the twitter and trill of song 
sparrows and a cat bird, and the sweetness from 
a whole garden full of blossoms. All came in with 
the warm air, in lavish luxury of beauty and sound. 
We were sitting silent, both of us quietly taking 
the enjoyment of it ; and I confess the sound of a 
fcot on the gravel walk and tripping up the piazza 
steps, was to me at least anything but welcome. 
It was a lady's foot, I knew. 

Visiters " said Mrs. Bowdoin under her breath. 

"Will you see them?" 



 

" yes. Ha, Ernestine ! is that you ? I am glad 
to see you. Come in." 

And there tripped in at the open door to be sure, 
the very identical little lady I had had occasion to 
know here and elsewhere once before. Since my 
first visit to Olive, now ten or eleven years ago, I 
had never seen her. I knew that she had married 
a wealthy Bostonian; that was nearly all I knew; 
at the time of my last stay in Philadelphia she was, 
I believe, in Washington. Now here she was again, 
just the same creature as of old; one glance shewed 
me that. A little worn ; the lines of cheek and tem 
ples were hollowed somewhat in the world's hard 
service ; but except that, the same ; the eyes were 
as glittering and as saucy, the mouth had its old 
trick of petulant wilfulness. She was well dressed, 
very well dressed; not in black, as I remember I 
first saw her, but this time in white; dainty and 
gauzy in floating white grenadine, or some similar 
stuff, with laces and laces, and a broad brimmed 
round hat with a wavy, curling, jaunty white feather. She took off the hat as she came in and shook 
down her black tresses, with the same action of 
long ago. 

" Ernestine ! " Mrs. Bowdoin repeated. " How 
do you do ? " 

She returned the question, with a certain demure 
grace she can assume. Mrs. Bowdoin answered, 
somewhat in detail. Meanwhile the black eyes 
came over to me and surveyed me; I felt it with 
out meeting them. Then she said softly, 



 

" Miss Burgoyrie does not recollect me." 

" Do you recollect me ? " I asked smiling. 

"Why shouldn't I? I have not lost my memory." 

" But ten years eleven years " 

" don't tell me about ten years ! You are not 
changed a hair." 

" Desire is too young for her hair to be changed," 
Mrs. Bowdoin said laughing. 

"I don't mean that. You are very slow thia 
morning, Mrs. Bowdoin ! I mean, she is not a bit, 
not the least bit, altered since the last time I met 
her." 

"I think she is altered, for the better," Mrs. 
Bowdoin returned. "I think she is grown hand 
somer than she was then. She is a little thin, 
perhaps." 

- "Why should she be handsomer?" was the in 
stant retort, so quickly and so coolly given that 
Mrs. Bowdoin and I could neither of us help laugh 
ing. 

"I mean," went on the lady, "what is there in 
ten years to make a person grow better looking ? 
Am I changed ? " 

Mrs. Bowdoin did not answer, and she turned 
to me. 

"Would you have known me again, Miss Bur- 
goyne V " 

"Certainly!" 

" I don't seem to you altered ? " 

"You seem to me very much like your old self 
as I used to know you." 



 

"But altered? Do you think I am altered? 
Answer ! " 

" Perhaps a little. But it is not the years, I 
think." 

" How am I altered ? " she said eagerly. " And 
what do you think it is that has altered me, if it is 
not the years? Speak, and tell me. How am I 
changed? " 

"There is a little difference in the lines of your 
faceit is not easy to say just what it is. I should 
think it was not years, but " I hesitated, " want 
of rest." 

There flew a second's shadow over her face; then 
she laughed, half scornfully, half bitterly. 

"That is, I have married St. Ives," she said. 
"A woman gives up her peace when she marries; doesn't she, Mrs. Bowdoin? I put it off as 
long as I could ; but I was afraid of putting it off 
too long, you know, and that won't do. Men are 
such plagues ! they every one of them think they 
must always have their own way; and naturally I 
know the taste of that sweet pleasure myself, and 
so the battle begins. Don't you ever marry, Miss 
Burgoyne ! unless you are prepared to fight for 
every individual step you take, and not always 
get it then. You are not afraid of being an old 
maid, are you ? " 

"I hope not," said Mrs. Bowdoin; who I saw did 
not like the lady's manner, and was willing to give 
the conversation a turn. " When was the last time 
you saw Desire, Ernestine ? " 



 

"She says it is ten years ago. I know; I recollect. I was in Philadelphia, and you were staying with your sister; not Mrs. Birkenstall, but the 
other. How does Mr. Iredell get along without 
her?" 

I was too astonished at this bold question to answer. Mrs. Bowdoin replied gravely, 

" You know Mr. Iredell, and you know he would 
be always like himself." 

" Yes, but I mean, was he terribly cut up ? " 

I have not seen him," said Mrs. Bowdoin coldly, 
"Have you?" 

"Yes, I have seen him," said Ernestine, "but 
that don't tell one anything. I talked to him too, 
and I tried to find out; but I might as well have 
flattered a Pyramid. He turned the tables on me, 
as he has a mean way of doing, and the first thing 
I knew, he was putting me through the catechism 
But by the way; what's he going abroad for?" 

Mrs. Bowdoin exclaimed. 

"You knew he was going? Didn't you know he 
was going, Miss Burgoyne ? " 

I replied that I had not known it. 

" Well, there is some news for you. Yes, he is 
going, r know, for I asked him myself, and he 
said so. He is going to Egypt, he says. We know 
what that means, or at least what it looks like. Of 
course people will say he cannot get over his wife's 
death, and he is going to try a change. Dear me ! 
I wish I could go too and for the same reason ! " 

There was a wicked little laugh following these 



 

words, which put a peculiar interpretation upon 
them. Mrs. Bowdoin passed that subject, and asked 
when Mr. Iredell expected to sail ? 

"Why now soon he may be in Boston any 
day ; for he said he would go by the Cunard line, 
and he thought, about midsummer. You will see 
him here before you know it; for of course he will 
call on you, Mrs. Bowdoin. I am sorry, he won't 
call on me. I asked him, but he said he should be 
in Boston only a day or two." 

" What is he going to Egypt for ? " 

"Ask him," said Ernestine. "I told you what 
people will say. Men go where they like, and for 
what they like. I wish women could. dear 
Mrs. Bowdoin, haven't you often wished you were 
a man ? " 

" Never in my life ! " 

"They have a great deal the best time. I think 
it is just horrid, to have to ask somebody else when 
you want to do anything! Now a man is independent. Catch them asking their wives leave 
about their plans! or if they do it, you despise 
them ; but Ave, poor creatures What is the rea 
son, Mrs. Bowdoin? Women are better than men; 
why should they have the worst time ? " 

" You would not like to change, and do a man's 
work, Ernestine." 

" Wouldn't I ? " she said, looking down at her 
gloves, which as usual were of the daintiest description. " Well, we do get our revenge a little, 
by making fools of the men. Only sometimes I 



 

am tired of it. What is the consolation, after you 
have made fools of them ? " 

"You cannot do it with everybody." 

" I can," she said instantly. " I do it. I have 
done it all my life. The only man I ever saw, that 
I couldn't make a fool of, is Maximilian Iredell; 
and that's why I like him more than I do any oth 
er man living." 

"Ernestine ! your husband?" 

"I don't except him," she said, laughing mis
