 ' Yrxwly, Hevace Eveeloj.' 


" I was still not satisfied. These generalities did not meet 
the question. They were crisp, and vigorous, and delivered 
with a confidence that almost compelled conviction ; but at such 
a time as this, with a human life at stake, they seemed inap- 
propriate, worldly, and in bad taste. At any other time I 
would have been not only glad, but proud, to receive from a 
man like Mr. Greeley a letter of this kind, and would have 
studied it earnestly and tried to improve myself all I could ; 
but now, with that poor boy in his far home languishing for 
relief, I had no heart for learning. 

" Three days passed by, and I read the note again. Again 
its tenor had changed. It now appeared to say : 

' Potations do sometimes wake wines ; turnips restrain passion ; causes necessary 
to state. Infest the poor widow ; her lord's efiects will be void. But dirt, bath- 
ing, etc., etc., followed unfairly, will worm him from his folly — so swear not. 

Yrxwly, Hevace Eveeloj.' 

" This was more like it. But I was unable to proceed. I 
was too much worn. The word ' turnips ' brought temporary 
joy and encouragement, but my strength was so much impaired, 
and the delay might be so perilous for the boy, that I relin- 
quished the idea of pursuing the translation farther, and re- 
solved to do what I ought to have done at first. I sat down 
and wrote Mr. Greeley as follows : 

"Dear Sir: I fear I do not entirely comprehend your kind note. It cannot 
be possible, Sir, that ' turnips restrain passion ' — at least the study or contempla- 
tion of turnips cannot — for it is this very employment that has scorched our poor 
friend's mind and sapped his bodily strength. — But if they do restrain it, will you 
bear with us a little further and explain how they should be prepared ? I observe 
that you say ' causes necessary to state,' but you have omitted to state them. 

" Under a misapprehension, you seem to attribute to me interested motives In 
this matter — to call it by no harsher term. But I assure you, dear sir, that if I 
seem to be ' infesting the widow,' it is all seeming, and void of reality. It is from 
no seeking of mine that I am in this position. She asked me, herself, to write 
you. I never have infested her — indeed I scarcely know her. I do not infest 
anybody. I try to go along, in my humble way, doing as near right as I can, never 
harming anybody, and never throwing out insimiations. As for ' her lord and his 
effects,' they are of no interest to me. I trust I have effects enough of my own 
— shall endeavor to get along with them, at any rate, and not go mousing around 
to get hold of somebody's that are ' void" But do you not see ? — this woman is 
a widow — she has no 'lord.' lie is dead — or pretended to be, when they buried 

him. Therefore, no amount of ' dirt, bathing,' etc., etc., howsoever ' unfairly fol- 
lowed' will be likely to ' worm him from his folly ' — if being dead and a ghost i«- 
'folly.' Tour closing remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for; and if report 
says true you might have applied it to yourself, sir, with more point and less impro- 
priety. Very Truly Yours, Simon Erickson. 

"In the course of a few days, Mr. Greeley did what would 
have saved a world of trouble, and much mental and bodily 
suffering and misunderstanding, if he had done it sooner. To- 
wit, he sent an intelligible rescript or translation of his original 
note, made in a plain hand by his clerk. Then the myster j 
cleared, and I saw that his heart had been right, all the time. 
I will recite the note in its clarified form : 

[Translation.] 

' Potatoes do sometimes make vines ; turnips remain passive : cause unnecessary 
to state. Inform the poor widow her lad's efforts will be vain. But diet, bath- 
ing, etc. etc., followed uniformly, will wean him from his folly — so fear not. 

Yours, HoEACB Greeley.' 

" But alas, it was too late, gentlemen — too late. The crim- 
inal delay had done its work — young Beazely was no more. 
His spirit had taken its flight to a land where all anxieties 
shall be charmed away, all desires gratified, all ambitions real- 
ized. Poor lad, they laid him to his rest with a turnip in each 
hand." 

So ended Erickson, and lapsed again into nodding, mumbling, 
and abstraction. The company broke up, and left him so. . . . 
But they did not say what drove him crazy. In the momen- 
tary confusion, I forgot to ask. 



CHAPTER LXXI. 

AT four o'clock in the afternoon we were winding down a 
mountain of dreary and desolate lava to the sea, and clos- 
ing our pleasant land journey. This lava is the accumulation 
of ages ; one torrent of tire after another has rolled down here 
in old times, and built up the island structure higher and 
higher. Underneath, it is honey-combed with caves ; it would 
be of no use to dig wells in such a place ; they would not hold 
water — you would not find any for them to hold, for that mat- 
ter. Consequently, the planters depend upon cisterns. 

The last lava flow occurred here so long ago that there are 
none now living who witnessed it. In one place it enclosed and 
burned doM'n a grove of cocoa-nut trees, and the holes in the 
lava where the trunks stood are still visible ; their sides retain 
the impression of the bark ; the trees fell upon the burning 
river, and becoming partly submerged, left in it the perfect 
counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf, and even nut, 
for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon and 
wonder at. 

There were doubtless plenty of Kanaka sentinels on guard 
hereabouts at that time, but they did not leave casts of 
their figures in the lava as the Roman sentinels at Ilerculaneum 
and Pompeii did. It is a pity it is so, because such things are 
so interesting ; but so it is. They probably went away. They 
went away early, perhaps. However, they had their merits ; 
the Romans exhibited the higher pluck, but the Kanakas 
showed the sounder judgment. 

Shortly we came in sight of that spot whose history is so 
familiar to every school-boy in the wide world — Kealakekna 
Bay — the place where Captain Cook, the great circumnaviga- 
tor, was killed by the natives, nearly a hundred years ago. 
The setting sun was flaming npon it, a Summer shower was 
falling, and it was spanned by two magnificent rainboM's. Two 
men who were in advance of us rode through one of these and 
for a moment their garments shone with a more than regal 
splendor. Why did not Captain Cook have taste enough to 
call his great discovery the Rainbow Islands? These charm- 
ing spectacles are pi*esent to you at every turn ; they are com- 
mon in all the islands ; they are visible every day, and fre- 
quently at night also — not the silvery bow we see once in an 
age in the States, by moonlight, but barred with all bright and 
beautiful colors, like the children of the sun and rain. I saw 
one of them a few nights ago. What the sailors call " rain, 
dogs " — little patches of rainbow — are often seen drifting about 
the heavens in these latitudes, like stained cathedral windows. 

Kealakekna Bay is a little curve like the last kink of a snail- 
shell, winding deep into the land, seemingly not more than a 
mile wide fi-om shore to shore. It is bounded on one side — 
where the murder was done — by a little flat plain, on M'hich 
stands a cocoanut grove and some mined houses; a steep wall 
of lava, a thousand feei high at the npper end and three or 
fonr hundred at the lower, comes down from the mountain and 
bounds the inner extremity of it. From this wall the place 
takes its name, Kealcikekua which in the native tongue signi- 
fies " The Pathway of the Gods." They say, (and still believe, 
in spite of their liberal education in Christianity), that the 
great god Lono., who nsed to live upon the hillside, always 
traveled that causeway when urgent business connected with 
heavenly afiairs called him down to the seashore in a hui-ry. 

As the red sun looked across the placid ocean through 

the tall, clean stems of the cocoanut trees, like a blooming 

whiskey bloat through the bars of a city prison, I went and stood 

in the edge of the water on the flat rock pressed by Captain 
Cook's feet when the blow was dealt which took away his life, 
and tried to picture in my mind the doomed man struggling in 
the midst of the multitude of exasperated savages — the men 

in the ship crowding to the vessel's side and gazing in anxious 
dismay toward the shore — the — but I discovered that I could 
not do it. 

It was growing dark, the rain began to fall, we could see that 
the distant Boomerang was helplessly Ijecalmed at sea, and so I 
adjourned to the cheerless little box of a warehouse and sat 
down to smolve and think, and wish the ship would make the 
land — for we had not eaten much for ten hours and were vic- 
iously hungry. 

Plain unVarnished history takes the romance out of Captain 
Cook's assassination, and renders a deliberate verdict of
justifiable homicide. Wherever he went among the islands, he was 
cordially received and welcomed by the inhabitants, and his 

ships lavishly supplied with all manner of food. He returned 
these kindnesses with insult and ill-treatment. Perceivang: that 
the people took him for the long vanished and lamented god 
Lono, he encouraged them in the delusion for the sake of the 
limitless power it gave him ; but during the famous disturbance 
at this spot, and while he and his comrades were surrounded 
by fifteen thousand maddened savages, he received a hurt and 
betrayed his eai'tlily origin with a groan. It was his death- 
warrant. Instantly a shout went up : " He groans ! — he is not, 
a god !" So they closed in upon him and dispatched him. 

His flesh was stripped from the bones and burned (except 
nine pounds of it which were sent on board the ships). The 
heart was hung up in a native hut, where it was found and 
eaten by three children, who mistook it for the heart of a dog. 
One of these children grew to be a very old man, and died in 
Honolulu a few years ago. Some of Cook's bones were recov- 
ered and consigned to the deep by the officers of the ships. 

Small blame should attach to the natives for the killino: of 
Cook. They treated him well. In return, he abused them. 
He and his men inflicted bodily injury upon many of them at 
d.'fferent times, and killed at least three of them before they 
o;'3;ered any proportionate i-etaHation. 

Xear the shore we found " Cook's Monument " — only a cocoa- 
nut stump, four feet high and about a foot in diameter at the 
batt. It had lava boulders piled around its base to hold it up 
and keep it in its place, and it was entirely sheathed over, from 
t(,>p to bottom, with rough, discolored sheets of copper, such as 
ships' bottoms are coppered with. Each sheet had a rude 
inscription scratched upon it — with a nail, apparently — and in 
every case the execution was wretched. Most of these merely 
recorded the visits of British naval commanders to the spot, 
but one of them bore this legend : ' 

" Near this spot fell 

CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, 

The Distinguished Circumnavigator, who Discovered these 

Islands A. D. 1778. 


After Cook's murder, his second in command, on board the 
ship, opened lire upon the swarms of natives on the beach, and 
one of iiis cannon balls cut this cocoanut tree short ofi' and left 
this monumental stump standing. It looked sad and lonely 
enough to us, out there in the rainy twilight. But there is no 
other monument to Captain Cook. True, up on the mountain 
side we had passed by a large inclosure like an ample hog-pen, 
built of lava blocks, which marks the spot where Cook's flesh 
was stripped from his bones and burned ; but this is not prop- 
erly a monument since it was erected by the natives themselves, 
and less to do honor to the circumnavigator than for the sake 
of convenience in roasting him. A thing like a guide-board 
was elevated above this pen on a tall pole, and formerly there 
was an inscription upon it describing the memorable occurrence 
that had there taken place ; but the sun and the wind have long 
ago so defaced it as to render it illegible. 

Toward midnight a fine breeze sprang up and the schooner 
soon worked herself into the bay and cast anchor. The boat 
came ashore for us, and in a little while the clouds and the 
rain were all gone. The moon was beaming tranquilly down 
on land and sea, and we two were stretched upon the deck 
sleeping the refreshing sleep and dreaming the happy dreams 
that are only vouchsafed to the weary and the innocent. 

CHAPTER LXXII. 

IN the breezy morning we went ashore and visited the mined 
temple of the last god Lono. The high chief cook of this 
temple — the priest who presided over it and roasted the hnman 
sacrifices — was uncle to Obookia, and at one time that youth 
was an apprentice-priest under him. Obookia was a young 
native of fine mind, who, together with three other native boys, 
was taken to New England by the captain of a whaleship dur- 
ing the reign of Kamehameha I, and they were the means of 
attracting the attention of the religious world to their country. 
This resulted in the sending of missionaries there. And this 
Obookia was the very same sensitive savage who sat down on 
the church steps and wept because his people did not have the 
Bible. That incident has been very elaborately painted in 
many a charming Sunday School book — aye, and told so plain- 
tively and so tenderly that I have cried over it in Sunday 
School myself, on general principles, although at a time when 
I did not know much and could not understand why the peo- 
ple of the Sandwich Islands needed to worry so much about it 
as long as they did not know there was a Bible at all. 

Obookia was converted and educated, and was to have re- 
turned to his native land with the first missionaries, had he 
lived. The other native youths made the voyage, and two of 
them did good service, but the third, William Kanui, fell from 
grace afterward, for a time, and when the gold excitement 
broke out in California he journeyed thither and went to mining, 
although he was fifty years old. He succeeded pretty 
well, but the failure of Page, Bacon & Co. relieved him of six 
thousand dollars, and then, to all intents and purposes, he was 
a bankrupt in his old age and he resumed service in the pulpit 
again. lie died in Honolulu in 1864. 

Quite a broad tract of land near the temple, extending from 
the sea to the mountain top, was sacred to the god Lono in 
olden times — so sacred that if a common native set his sacrile- 
gious foot U2:)on it it was judicious for him to make his will, 
because his time had come. He might go around it by water, 
but he could not cross it. It was well sprinkled with pagan 
temples and stocked with awkward, homely idols carved out 
of logs of wood. There was a temple devoted to prayers for 
rain — and with fine sagacity it was placed at a point so well 
up on the mountain side that if you prayed there twenty-four 
times a day for rain you would be likely to get it every time. 


You would seldom get to your Amen before you would have 
to hoist your umbrella. 

And there was a large temple near at hand which was built 
in a single night, in the midst of storm and thunder and rain, 
by the ghastly hands of dead men ! Tradition says that by the 


wierd glare of the lightning a noiseless multitude of phantoms 
were seen at their strange labor far np the mountain side at 
dead of night — flitting hither and thither and bearing great 
lava-blocks clasped in their nerveless Angers — appearing and 
disappearing as the pallid lustre fell upon their forms and faded 
away again. Even to this day, it is said, the natives hold this 
dread structure in awe and reverence, and will not pass by it 
in the night. 

At noon I observed a bevy of nude native young ladies bath- 
ing in the sea, and went and sat down on their clothes to keep 
them from being stolen. I begged them to come out, for the 
sea was rising and I was satisfied that they were running some 
risk. But they were not afraid, and presently went on with 
their sport. They were finished swimmers and divers, and
enjoyed themselves to the last degree. They swam races, sjlashed 
and ducked and tumbled each other about, and filled the air 
with their laughter. It is said that the first thing an Islander 
learns is how to swim ; learning to walk being a matter of 
smaller consequence, comes afterward. One hears tales of na- 
tive men and women swimming ashore from vessels many 
miles at sea — more miles, indeed, than I dare vouch for or even 
mention. And they tell of a native diver who went down in 
thirty or forty-foot waters and brought up an anvil ! I think 
he swallowed the anvil afterward, if my memoiy serves me. 
However I will not nrge this point. 

I have spoken, several times, of the god Lono — I may as 
well furnish two or three sentences concerning him. 

The idol the natives worshiped for him was a slender, unor- 
namented staff twelve feet long. Tradition says he was a fa- 
vorite god on the Island of Hawaii — a great king who had 
been deihed for meritorious services — just our own fashion of 
rewarding heroes, with the difference that we would have made 
him a Postmaster instead of a god, no doubt. In an angry 
moment he slew his wife, a goddess named Kaikilani Aiii. 
Remorse of conscience drove him mad, and tradition presents 
us the singular spectacle of a god traveling " on the shoulder ;" 
for in his gnawing grief he wandered about from place to place 
boxing and wrestling with all whom he met. Of course this 
pastime soon lost its novelty, inasmuch as it must necessarily 
have been the case that when so powerful a deity sent a frail 
human opponent " to grass " he never came back any more. 
Therefore, he instituted games called makahiki, and ordered 
that they should be held in his honor, and then sailed for for- 
eign lands on a three-cornered raft, stating that he would return 
some day — and that was the last of Lono. He was never seen 
anv more ; his raft got swamped, perhaps. But the people 
always expected his return, and thus they were easily led to 
accept Captain Cook as the restored god. 

Some of the old natives believed Cook was Lono to the day 
of their death; but many did not, for they could not under- 
stand how he could die if he was a god. 

Only a mile or so from Kealakekua Bay is a spot of historic 
interest — the place where the last battle was fought for idolatry. 
Of course we visited it, and came away as wise as most people 
do who go and gaze upon such mementoes of the past when in 
an unrcflective mood. 

While the first missionaries were on their way around the 
Horn, the idolatrous customs which had obtained in the island, 
as far back as tradition reached were suddenly broken up. Old 

Ivameliamelia I., was dead, and his son, Liholiho, the new King 
was a free liver, a roystering, dissolute fellow, and hated the 
restraints of the ancient tahu. His assistant in the Govern- 
ment, Kaahumanu, the Queen dowager, was proud and high- 
spirited, and hated the tahu because it restricted the privileges 
of her sex and degraded all women very nearly to the level of 
brutes. So the case stood. Liholiho had half a mind to put 
his foot down, Kaahumahu had a whole mind to badger him 
into doing it, and whiskey did the rest. It was probably the 
rest. It was probably the first time whiskey ever prominently 
figured as an aid to civilization. Liholiho came up to Kailua 
as drunk as a piper, and attended a great feast ; the determined 
Queen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch, and 
then, while all the multitude stared in blank dismay, he moved 
deliberately forward and sat down with the women! They 
saw him eat from the same vessel with them, and were appalled ! 
Terrible moments drifted slowly by, and still the King ate. 

Still he lived, still the lightnings of the insulted gods were 
withheld ! Then conviction came like a revelation — the super- 
stitions of a hundred generations passed from before the people 
like a cloud, and a shout went up, " the tahu is broken ! the 
tcihu is broken !" 

Thus did King Liholiho and his dreadful whiskey preach the 
first sermon and prepare the way for the new gospel that was 
speeding southward over the waves of the Atlantic. 

The tabu broken and destruction failing to follow the awful 
sacrilege, the people, with that childlike precipitancy which has 
ill ways characterized them, jumped to the conclusion that their 
gods were a weak and wretched swindle, just as they formerly 
jumped to the conclusion that Captain Cook was no god, merely 
because he groaned, and promptly killed him without stopping 
to inquire whether a god might not groan as well as a man if 
it suited his convenience to do it ; and satislied that the idols 
were powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once 
and pulled them down — hacked them to pieces — applied the 
torch — annihilated them ! 

The pagan priests were furious. And well they might be; 
they had held the fattest offices in the land, and now they were 
l3eggared ; they had been great — they had stood above the 
chiefs — and now they were vagabonds. They raised a revolt; 
they scared a number of people into joining their standard, and 
Bekuokalani, an ambitious offshoot of royalty, was easily per- 
suaded to become their leader. 

In the first skirmish the idolaters triumphed over the royal 
army sent against them, and full of confidence they resolved 
to march upon Kailua. The King sent an envoy to try and 
conciliate them, and came very near being an envoy short by 
the operation ; the sa'ages not only refused to listen to him, 
but wanted to kill him. So the King sent his men forth under 
Major General Kalaimoku and the two hosts met at Kuamoo. 
The battle was long and fierce — men and women fighting side 
by side, as was the custom — and when the day was done the 
rebels were flying in every direction in hopeless panic, and 
idolatry and the tahu were dead in the land ! 


The royalists marched gayly home to Ivaihia glorifying the 
new dispensation. " There is no power in the gods," said they ; 
' they are a vanity and a lie. The army with idols was weak; 
the army without idols was strong and victorious !" 

The nation was without a religion. 

The missionary ship arrived in safety shortly afterward, timed 
by providential exactness to meet the emergency, and the Gos- 
pel was planted as in a virgin soil. 




CHAPTER LXXIII. 

AT noon, we hired a Kanaka to take us down to the ancient 
ruins at Honaunau in his canoe — price two dollars — rea- 
sonable enough, for a sea voyage of eight miles, counting both 
ways. 

The native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance. I 
cannot think of anything to liken it to but a boy's sled runner 
hollowed out, and that does not quite convey the correct idea. 
It is about fifteen feet long, high and pointed at both ends, is a 
foot and a half or two feet deep, and so narrow that if you 
wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out again. It 
sits on top of the water like a duck, but it has an outrig- 
ger and does not upset easily, if you keep still. This outrig- 
ger is formed of two long bent sticks like piow handles, which 
project from one side, and to their outer ends is bound a curved 
beam composed of an extremely light wood, which skims along 
the surffice of the water and thus saves you from an upset on 
that side, while the outrigger's M'eight is not so easily lifted as 
to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly feared. 
Still, until one gets used to sitting perched upon this knife- 
blade, he is apt to reason within himself that it M'ould be more 
comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other 
side also. 

I had the bow seat, and Billings sat amidships and faced the 
Kanaka, who occupied the stern of the craft and did the pad- 
dling. "With the first stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out 
from the shore like an arrow. There was not much to see. 
While we were on the shallow water of the reef, it was pastime 
to look down into the limpid depths at the large launches of 
branching coral — the unique shrubbery of the sea. We lost 
that, though, when we got out into the dead blue water of the 
deep. But we had the picture of the surf, then, dashing 
angrily against the crag-bound shore and sending a foaming 
spray high into the air. There was interest in this beetling 
border, too, for it was honey-combed with quaint caves and arches 
and tunnels, and had a rude semblance of the dilapidated architec- 
ture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of the restless sea. 
When this novelty ceased to be a novelty, we turned our eyes 
shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green 
forests stretching up into the curtaining clouds, and at the 
specks of houses in the rearward distance and the diminished 
schooner riding sleepily at anchor. And when these grew tire- 
some we dashed boldly into the midst of a school of huge, 
beastly porpoises engaged at their eternal game of arching over 
a wave and disappearing, and then doing it over again and keep- 
ing it np — always circling over, in that way, like so many well- 
snbmerged wheels. But the porpoises wheeled themselves 
away, and then we were thrown upon our own resources. It 
did not take many minutes to discover that the sun was blazing 
like a bonfire, and that the weather was of a melting tempera- 
ture. It had a drowsing effect, too. 

In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, 
of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the 
national pastime of surf-bathing. Each heathen would paddle 
three or four hundred yards out to sea, (taking a short board 
with him), then face the shore and wait for a particularly pro- 
digious billow to come along ; at the right moment he would 
fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board, 
and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell ! It did 
not seem that a lightning express train could shoot along at a 
more hair-lifting speed. I tried surf-bathing once, subsequently, 
but made a failure of it. I got the board placed right, and at 
the right moment, too ; but missed the connection myself.- 
board struck the shore in three quarters of a second, 
without any cargo, and I struck the bottom about the 
same time, with a couple of 
barrels of water in me. 
None but natives ever master the art of surf-bathing 
thoroughly. At the end of an hour, we 
had made the four miles, and 
landed on a level point of 
land, upon which was a wide surf-bathing— failure. 
extent of old ruins, with many a tall cocoanut tree growing 
among them. Here was the ancient City of Refuge — a vast 
inclosure, whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the base 
and fifteen feet high ; an oblong square, a thousand and forty 
feet one way and a fraction under seven hundred the other. 
Within this inclosure, in early times, has been three rude 
temples ; each two hundred and ten feet long by one hundred 
wide, and thirteen high. 

In those days, if a man killed another anywhere on the island 
the relatives were privileged to take the murderer's life; ami 
then a chase for life and liberty began — the outlawed criminal 
flying through pathless forests and over mountain and plain, 
with his hopes fixed upon the protecting walls of the City of 
Refuge, and the avenger of blood following hotly after him  
Sometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the tem- 
ple, and the panting pair sped through long files of excited 
natives, who watched the contest with flashing eye and dilated 
nostril, encouraging the hunted refugee with sharp, inspiriting- 
ejacidations, and sending up a ringing shout of exultation when 
the saving gates closed upon him and the cheated pursuer sank 
exhausted at the threshold. But sometimes the flying criminal 
fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door, wlien one 
more brave stride, one more brief second of time would have 
brought his feet upon the sacred ground and barred him against 
all harm. Where did these isolated pagans get this idea of a 
City of Refuge — this ancient Oriental custom ? 

This old sanctuary was sacred to all — even to rebels in arms 
and invading armies. Once within its walls, and confession 
made to the priest and absolution obtained, the wretch with a 
price upon his head could go forth without fear and without 
danger — he was tabu, and to harm him was death. The routed 
rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this place to claim 
sanctuary, and many were thus saved. 

Close to the corner of the great in closure is a round structure 
of stone, some six or eight feet high, with a level top about 
ten or twelve in diameter. This was the jlace of execution. 
A high palisade of cocoanut piles shut out the cruel scenes 
from the vulgar multitude. Here criminals were killed, the 
flesh stripped from the bones and burned, and the bones secre- 
ted in holes in the body of the structure. If the man had been 
guilty of a high crime, the entire coi'pse was burned. 

The walls of the temple are a study. The same food for 
speculation that is offered the visitor to the Pyramids of Egypt 
he will find here — the mystery of how they were constructed 
by a people unacquainted with science and mechanics. The 
natives have no invention of their own for hoisting heavy 
weights, they had no beasts of burden, and they have never 
even shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever. 
Yet some of the lava blocks quarried out, brought over rough, 
broken ground, and built into this wall, six or seven feet from 
the ground, are of prodigious size and would weigh tons. How 
did they transport and how raise them ? 

Both the inner .and outer surfaces of the walls present a 
smooth front and are very creditable specimens of masonry. 
The blocks are of all manner of shapes and sizes, but yet are 
fitted together with the neatest exactness. The gradual nar- 
rowing of the wall from the base upward is accurately preserved. 

No cement was used, but the edifice is firm and compact and 
is capable of resisting storm and decay for centui'ies. Who
