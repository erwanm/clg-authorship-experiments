impossible enough to answer Miss Dorcas's purpose.

But Mrs. Betsey was bursting to begin on the contents of her news-bag,
and so, out it came.

"Well now, Dorcas, if you won't go to being ridiculous, and talking
about Major Galbraith, I'll tell you who it is. It's that dear, good
Mr. Fellows that got Jack back again for us, and I'm sure I never feel
as if I could do enough for him when I think of it, and besides that,
he always is so polite and considerate, and talks with one so nicely
and is so attentive, seems to think something of you, if you are
an old woman, so that I'm glad with all my heart, for I think it's a
splendid thing, and she's just the one for him, and do you know I've
been thinking a great while that it was going to be? I have noticed
signs, and have had my own thoughts, but I didn't let on. I despise
people that are always prying and spying and expressing opinions
before they know."

This lucid exposition might have proceeded at greater length, had
not Miss Dorcas, whose curiosity was now fully roused, cut into the
conversation with an air of judicial decision.

"Well now, after all, Betsey, will you have the goodness, since you
began to tell the news, to tell it like a reasonable creature? Mr.
Fellows is the happy man, you say. Now, who--is--the woman?"

"Oh, didn't I tell you? Why, what is the matter with me to-day? I
thought I said Miss Alice Van Arsdel. Won't she make him a splendid
wife? and I'm sure he'll make a good husband; he's so kind-hearted.
Oh! you ought to have seen how kind he was to Jack that day he brought
him back; and such a sight as Jack was, too--all dirt and grease! Why
it took Dinah and me at least two hours to get him clean, and there
are not many young gentlemen that would be so patient as he was. I
never shall forget it of him."

"Patient as who was?" said Miss Dorcas. "I believe Jack was the last
nominative case in that sentence; do pray compose yourself, Betsey,
and don't take entire leave of your senses."

"I mean Mr. Fellows was patient, of course, you know."

"Well, then, do take a little pains to say what you mean," said Miss
Dorcas.

"Well, don't you think it a good thing--and were you expecting it?"

"So far as I know the parties, it's as good a thing as engagements in
general," said Miss Dorcas. "They have my very best wishes."

"Well, did you ever think it would come about?"

"No; I never troubled my head with speculations on what plainly is
none of my concern," said Miss Dorcas.

It was evident that Miss Dorcas was on the highest and most serene
mountain-top of propriety this morning, and all her words and actions
indicated that calm superiority to vulgar curiosity which, in her
view, was befitting a trained lady. Perhaps a little pique that Betsey
had secured such a promising bit of news in advance of herself, added
to her virtuous frigidity of demeanor. We are all mortal, and the
best of us are apt to undervalue what we did not ourselves originally
produce. But if Miss Dorcas wished in a gentle manner to remind Mrs.
Betsey that she was betraying too much of an inclination for gossip,
she did not succeed. The clock of time had gone back on the dial of
the little old lady, and she was as full of chatter and detail as
a school-girl, and determined at any rate to make the most of her
incidents, and to create a sensation in her sister's mind--for what
is more provoking than to have people sit calm and unexcited when we
have a stimulating bit of news to tell? It is an evident violation of
Christian charity. Mrs. Betsey now drew forth her next card.

"Oh, and, Dorcas! you've no idea. They've been having the most
dreadful time over there! Miss Alice has had the greatest escape! The
most wonderful providence! It really makes my blood run cold to think
of it. Don't you think, she was all dressed to go to Mrs. Wouvermans's
party, and her dress caught on fire, and if it hadn't been for Mr.
Fellows's presence of mind she might have been burned to death--really
burned to death! Only think of it!"

"You don't say so!" said Miss Dorcas, who now showed excitement enough
to fully satisfy Mrs. Betsey. "How very dreadful! Why, how was it?"

"Yes--she was passing in front of the fire, in a thin white tarlatan,
made very full, with flounces, and it was just drawn in and flashed up
like tinder. Mr. Fellows caught the cloth from the table, wrapped her
in it and laid her on the sofa, and then tore and beat out the fire
with his hands."

"Dear--me! dear--me!" said Miss Dorcas, "how dreadful! But he did just
the right thing."

"Yes, indeed; you ought to have seen! Mrs. Henderson showed me what
was left of the dress, and it was really awful to see! I could not
help thinking, 'In the midst of life we are in death.' All trimmed up
with scarlet velvet and bows, and just hanging in rags and tatters,
where it had been burned and torn away! I never saw any thing so
solemn in my life."

"A narrow escape, certainly," said Miss Dorcas. "And is she not
injured at all?"

"Nothing to speak of, only a few slight burns; but poor Mr. Fellows
has to have his hands bandaged and dressed every day; but of course he
doesn't mind that since he has saved her life. But just think of it,
Dorcas, we shall have two weddings, and it'll make two more visiting
places. I'm going to tell Dinah all about it," and the little woman
fled to the kitchen, with Jack at her heels, and was soon heard going
over the whole story again.

Dinah's effusion and sympathy, in fact, were the final refuge of Mrs.
Betsey on every occasion, whether of joy or sorrow or perplexity--and
between her vigorous exclamations and loud responses, and Jack's
running commentary of unrestrained barking, there was as much noise
over the announcement as could be made by an average town meeting.

Thus were the tidings received across the way. In the Van Arsdel
family, Jim was already an established favorite. Mr. Van Arsdel always
liked him as a bright, agreeable evening visitor, and, now that he
had acquired a position that promised a fair support, there was no
opposition on his part to overcome. Mrs. Van Arsdel was one of the
motherly, complying sort of women, generally desirous of doing what
the next person to her wanted her to do; and, though she was greatly
confused by remembering Alice's decided asseverations that "it never
was and never would be anything, and that Jim was not at all the
person she ever should think of marrying," yet, since it was evident
that she was now determined upon the affair, Mrs. Van Arsdel looked at
it on the bright side.

"After all, my dear," she said to her spouse, "if I must lose both my
daughters, it's a mercy to have them marry and settle down here in
New York, where I can have the comfort of them. Jim will always be
an attentive husband and a good family man. I saw that when he was
helping us move; but I'm sure I don't know what Maria will say now!"

"No matter what Maria says, my dear," said Mr. Van Arsdel. "It don't
make one hair white or black. It's time you were emancipated from
Maria."

But Aunt Maria, like many dreaded future evils, proved less formidable
on this occasion than had been feared.

The very submissive and edifying manner in which Mr. Jim Fellows had
received her strictures and cautions on a former occasion, and the
profound respect he had shown for her opinion, had so far wrought upon
her as to make her feel that it was really a pity that he was not a
young man of established fortune. If he only had anything to live
on, why, he might be a very desirable match; and so, when he had a
good position and salary, he stood some inches higher in her esteem.
Besides this, there was another balm which distilled resignation in
the cup of acquiescence, and that was the grand chance it gave her
to say, "I told you so." How dear and precious this privilege is to
the very best of people, we need not insist. There are times when it
would comfort them, if all their dearest friends were destroyed, to
be able to say, "I told you so. It's just as I always predicted!" We
all know how Jonah, though not a pirate or a cut-throat, yet wished
himself dead because a great city was not destroyed, when he had taken
the trouble to say it would be. Now, though Alice's engagement was not
in any strict sense an evil, yet it was an event which Aunt Maria had
always foreseen, foretold and insisted on.

So when, with heart-sinkings and infinite precautions, Mrs. Van Arsdel
had communicated the news to her, she was rather relieved at the
response given, with a toss of the head and a vigorous sniff:

"Oh, that's no news to me; it's just what I have foreseen all
along--what I told you was coming on, and you wouldn't believe it.
Now I hope all of you will see that I was right."

"I think," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, "that it was Jim's presence of mind
in saving her life that decided Alice at last. She always liked him;
but I don't think she really loved him till then."

"Well, of course, it was a good thing that there was somebody at hand
who had sense to do the right thing, when girls will be so careless;
but it wasn't that. She meant to have him all along; and I knew it,"
said Aunt Maria. "Well, Jim Fellows, after all, isn't the worst match
a girl could make, either, now that he has some prospects of his
own--but, at any rate, it has turned out just as I said it would. I
knew she'd marry him, six months ago, just as well as I know it now,
unless you and she listened to my advice then. So now all we have to
do is to make the best of it. You've got two weddings on your hands,
now Nellie, instead of one, and I shall do all I can to help you. I
was out all day yesterday looking at sheeting, and I think that at
Shanks & Maynard's is decidedly the firmest and the cheapest, and I
ordered three pieces sent home; and I carried back the napkins to
Taggart's, and then went rambling off up by the Park to find that
woman that does marking."

"I'm sure, Maria, I am ever so much obliged to you," said Mrs. Van
Arsdel.

"Well, I hope I'm good for something. Though I'm not fit to be out;
I've such a dreadful cold in my head, I can hardly see; and riding in
these New York omnibuses always makes it worse."

"Dear Maria, why will you expose yourself in that way?"

"Well, somebody's got to do it--and your judgment isn't worth a fip,
Nellie. That sheeting that you were thinking of taking wasn't half
so good, and cost six cents a yard more. I couldn't think of having
things go that way."

"But I'm sure we don't any of us want you to make yourself sick."

"Oh, I sha'n't be sick. I may suffer; but I sha'n't give up. I'm not
one of the kind. If you had the cold in your head that I have, Nellie,
you'd be in bed, with both girls nursing you; but that isn't my way.
I keep up, and attend to things. I want these things of Angie's to be
got up properly, as they ought to be, and there's nobody to do it but
me."

And little Mrs. Van Arsdel, used, from long habit, to be thus
unceremoniously snubbed, dethroned, deposed, and set down hard by her
sister when in full career of labor for her benefit, looked meekly
into the fire, and comforted herself with the reflection that it "was
just like Maria. She always talked so; but, after all, she was a good
soul, and saved her worlds of trouble, and made excellent bargains for
her."




CHAPTER XLVII.

"IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS."


This article of faith forms a part of the profession of all
Christendom, is solemnly recited every Sunday and many week-days in
the services of all Christian churches that have a liturgy, whether
Roman or Greek or Anglican or Lutheran, and may, therefore, bid fair
to pass for a fundamental doctrine of Christianity.

Yet, if narrowly looked into, it is a proposition under which there
are more heretics and unbelievers than all the other doctrines of
religion put together.

Mrs. Maria Wouvermans, standing, like a mother in Israel, in the
most eligible pew of Dr. Cushing's church, has just pronounced these
words with all the rest of the Apostles' Creed, which she has recited
devoutly twice a day every Sunday for forty years or more. She always
recited her creed in a good, strong, clear voice, designed to rebuke
the indolent or fastidious who only mumbled or whispered, and made a
deep reverence in the proper place at the name of Jesus; and somehow
it seemed to feel as if she were witnessing a good confession, and
were part and parcel with the protesting saints and martyrs that, in
blue and red and gold, were shining down upon her through the painted
windows. This solemn standing up in her best bonnet and reciting
her Christian faith every Sunday, was a weekly testimony against
infidelity and schism and lax doctrines of all kinds, and the good
lady gave it with unfaltering regularity. Nothing would have shocked
her more than to have it intimated to her that she did not believe
the articles of her own faith; and yet, if there was anything in the
world that Mrs. Maria Wouvermans practically didn't believe in, and
didn't mean to believe in, it was "the forgiveness of sins."

As long as people did exactly right, she had fellowship and sympathy
with them. When they did wrong, she wished to have nothing more to do
with them. Nay, she seemed to consider it a part of public justice and
good morals to clear her skirts from all contact with sinners. If she
heard of penalties and troubles that befell evil doers, it was with a
face of grim satisfaction. "It serves them right--just what they ought
to expect. I don't pity them in the least," were familiar phrases
with her. If anybody did her an injury, crossed her path, showed her
disrespect or contumely, she seemed to feel as free and full a liberty
of soul to hate them as if the Christian religion had never been heard
of. And, in particular, for the sins of women, Aunt Maria had the true
ingrain Saxon ferocity which Sharon Turner describes as characteristic
of the original Saxon female in the earlier days of English history,
when the unchaste woman was pursued and beaten, starved and frozen,
from house to house, by the merciless justice of her sisters.

It is the same spirit that has come down through English law and
literature, and shows itself in the old popular ballad of "Jane
Shore," where, without a word of pity, it is recorded how Jane Shore,
the king's mistress, after his death, first being made to do public
penance in a white sheet, was thereafter turned out to be frozen and
starved to death in the streets, and died miserably in a ditch, from
that time called Shoreditch. A note tells us that there was one man
who, moved by pity, at one time sheltered the poor creature and gave
her food, for which he was thrown into prison, to the great increase
of her sorrow and misery.

It was in a somewhat similar spirit that Mrs. Wouvermans regarded
all sinning women. Her uniform ruling in such cases was that they
were to be let alone by all decent people, and that if they fell into
misery and want, it was only just what they deserved, and she was
glad of it. What business had they to behave so? In her view, all
efforts to introduce sympathy and mercy into prison discipline--all
forbearance and pains-taking with the sinful and lost in all places
in society--was just so much encouragement given to the criminal
classes, and one of the lax humanitarian tendencies of the age. It is
quite certain that had Mrs. Wouvermans been a guest in old times at a
certain Pharisee's house, where the Master allowed a fallen woman to
kiss His feet, she would have joined in saying: "If this man were a
prophet he would have known what manner of woman this is that toucheth
him, for she is a sinner." There was certainly a marked difference
of spirit between her and that Jesus to whom she bowed so carefully
whenever she repeated the creed.

On this particular Sunday, Eva had come to church with her aunt, and
was going to dine with her, intent on a mission of Christian diplomacy.

Some weeks had now passed since she left Maggie in the mission
retreat, and it was the belief of the matron there, and the attending
clergyman, that a change had taken place in her, so radical and so
deep that, if now some new and better course of life were opened to
her, she might, under careful guidance, become a useful member of
society. Whatever views modern skepticism may entertain in regard
to what is commonly called the preaching of the gospel, no sensible
person conversant with actual facts can help acknowledging that it
does produce in some cases the phenomenon called conversion, and
that conversion, when real, is a solution of all difficulties in our
days as it was in those of the first apostles.

The first Christians were gathered from the dregs of society, and
the Master did not fear to say to the Pharisees, "The publicans and
harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you;" and St. Paul
addresses those who he says had been thieves and drunkards and
revilers and extortioners, with the words, "Ye are washed; ye are
sanctified; ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
spirit of God."

It is on the power of the Divine spirit to effect such changes, even
in the most hopeless and forlorn subjects, that Christians of every
name depend for success; and by this faith such places as the Home for
the Fallen are undertaken and kept up.

What people look for, and labor for, as is proved by all experience,
is more liable to happen than what they do not expect and do not
labor for. The experiment of Mr. James was attended by many marked
and sudden instances of conversion and permanent change of character.
Maggie had been entrapped and drawn in by Mother Moggs in one of those
paroxysms of bitter despair which burned in her bosom, when she saw,
as she thought, every respectable door of life closed upon her and
the way of virtue shut up beyond return. When she thought how, while
she was cast out as utterly beyond hope, the man who had betrayed
her and sinned with her was respected, flattered, rich, caressed,
and joined in marriage to a pure and virtuous wife, a blind and keen
sense of injustice awoke every evil or revengeful passion within her.
"If they won't let me do good, I can do mischief," she thought, and
she was now ready to do all she could to work misery and ruin for a
world that would give her no place to do better. Mother Moggs saw
Maggie's brightness and smartness, and the remains of her beauty. She
flattered and soothed her. To say the truth, Mother Moggs was by no
means all devil. She had large remains of that motherly nature which
is common to warm-blooded women of easy virtue. She took Maggie's
part, was indignant at her wrongs, and offered her a shelter and a
share in her business. Maggie was to tend her bar; and by her talents
and her good looks and attractions Mother Moggs hoped to double her
liquor sales. What if it did ruin the men? What if it was selling them
ruin, madness, beggary--so much the better;--had they not ruined her?

If Maggie had been left to her own ways, she might have been the
ruin of many. It was the Christ in the heart of a woman who had the
Christian love and Christian courage to go after her and seek for her,
that brought to her salvation. The invisible Christ must be made known
through human eyes; he must speak through a voice of earthly love, and
a human hand inspired by his spirit must be reached forth to save.

The sight of Eva's pure, sweet face in that den of wickedness, the
tears of pity in her eyes, the imploring tones of her voice, had
produced an electric revulsion in Maggie's excitable nature. She was
not, then, forsaken: she was cared for, loved, followed even into
the wilderness, by one so far above her in rank and station. It was
an illustration of what Christian love was, which made it possible
to believe in the love of Christ. The hymns, the prayers, that spoke
of hope and salvation, had a vivid meaning in the light of this
interpretation. The enthusiasm of gratitude that arose first towards
Eva, overflowed and bore the soul higher towards a Heavenly Friend.

Maggie was now longing to come back and prove by her devotion and
obedience her true repentance, and Eva had decided to take her again.
With two weddings impending in the family, she felt that Maggie's
skill with the needle and her facility in matters pertaining to the
female toilet might do good service, and might give her the sense of
usefulness--the strength that comes from something really accomplished.

Her former experience made her careful, however, of those sore and
sensitive conditions which attend the return to virtue in those who
have sinned, and which are often severest where there is the most
moral vitality, and she was anxious to prevent any repetition on Aunt
Maria's part of former unwise proceedings. All the other habitués
of the house partook of her own feeling; Alice and Angie were warmly
interested for the poor girl; and if Aunt Maria could be brought to
tolerate the arrangement, the danger of a sudden domiciliary visit
from her attended with inflammatory results might be averted.

So Eva was very sweet and very persuasive in her manner to-day, for
Aunt Maria had been devoting herself so entirely to the family service
during the few weeks past, that she felt in some sort under a debt
of obligation to her. The hardest person in the world to manage is a
sincere, willful, pig-headed, pertinacious friend who will insist on
doing you all sorts of kindnesses in a way that plagues about as much
as it helps you.

But Eva was the diplomatist of the family; the one with the precise
mixture of the suaviter in modo with the fortiter in re. She
had hitherto carried her points with the good lady in a way that
gave her great advantage, for Aunt Maria was one of those happily
self-complacent people who do not fail to arrogate to themselves the
after the most strenuous efforts, to hinder, and Eva's credit of all
the good things that they have not been able, housekeeping and social
successes, so far, were quite a feather in her cap. So, after dinner,
Eva began with:

"Well, you know, Aunt Maria, what with these two weddings coming on,
there is to be a terrible pressure of work--both coming the week after
Easter, you see. So," she added quickly, "I think it quite lucky that
I have found Maggie and got her back again, for she is one of the
quickest and best seamstresses that I know of." Aunt Maria's brow
suddenly darkened. Every trace of good-humor vanished from her face as
she said:

"Now do tell me, Eva, if you are going to be such a fool, when
you were once fairly quit of that girl, to bring her back into your
family."

"Yes, Aunt, I thought it my Christian duty to take care of her, and
see that she did not go to utter ruin."

"I don't know what you mean," said Aunt Maria. "I should say she
had gone there now. Do you think it your duty to turn your house
into a Magdalen asylum?"

"No, I do not; but I do think it is our duty to try to help and save
this one girl whom we know--who is truly repentant, and who wants to
do well."

"Repentant!" said Aunt Maria in a scornful tone. "Don't tell me. I
know their tricks, and you'll just be imposed on and get yourself into
trouble. I know the world, and I know all about it." Eva now rose
and played her last card. "Aunt Maria," she said, "You profess to be
a Christian and to follow the Saviour who came to seek and save the
lost, and I don't think you do right to treat with such scorn a poor
girl that is trying to do better."

"It's pretty well of you, Miss, to lecture me in this style! Trying
to do better!" said Aunt Maria, "then what did she go off for, when
she was at your house and you were doing all you could for her? It was
just that she wanted to go to the bad."

"She went off, Aunt Maria," said Eva, "because she overheard all you
said about her, the day you were at my house. She heard you advising
me to send her mother away on her account, and saying that she was a
disgrace to me. No wonder she ran off."

"Well, serves her right for listening! Listeners never hear any good
of themselves," said Aunt Maria.

"Now, Aunty," said Eva, "nobody has more respect for your good
qualities than I have, or more sense of what we all owe you for your
kindness to us; but I must tell you fairly that, now I am married,
you must not come to my house to dictate about or interfere with my
family arrangements. You must understand that Harry and I manage these
matters ourselves and will not allow any interference; and I tell
you now that Maggie is to be at our house, and under my care, and I
request that you will not come there to say or do anything which may
hurt her mother's feelings or hers."

"Mighty fine," said Aunt Maria, rising in wrath, "when it has come to
this, that servants are preferred before me!"

"It has not come to that, Aunt Maria. It has simply come to this: that
I am to be sole mistress in my own family, and sole judge of what it
is right and proper to do; and when I need your advice I shall ask it;
but I don't want you to offer it unless I do."

Having made this concluding speech while she was putting on her bonnet
and shawl, Eva now cheerfully wished her aunt good afternoon, and made
the best of her way down-stairs.

"I don't see, Eva, how you could get up the courage to face your aunt
down in that way," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, to whom Eva related the
interview.

"Dear Mamma, it'll do her good. She will be as sweet as a rose after
the first week of indignation. Aunt Maria is a sensible woman, after
all, and resigns herself to the inevitable. She worries and hectors
you, my precious Mammy, because you will let her. If you'd show a
brave face, she wouldn't do it; but it isn't in you, you poor, lovely
darling, and so she just preys upon you; but Harry and I are resolved
to make her stand and give the countersign when she comes to our camp."

And it is a fact that, a week after, Aunt Maria spent a day with Eva
in the balmiest state of grace, and made no allusion whatever to the
conversation above cited. Nothing operates so healthfully on such
moral constitutions as a good dose of certainty.




CHAPTER XLVIII.

THE PEARL CROSS.


Every thoughtful person who exercises the least supervision over what
goes on within, is conscious of living two distinct lives--the outward
and the inward.

The external life is positive, visible, definable; easily made the
subject of conversation. The inner life is shy, retiring, most
difficult to be expressed in words, often inexplicable, even to the
subject of it, yet no less a positive reality than the outward.

We have not succeeded in the picture of our Eva unless we have shown
her to have one of those sensitive moral organizations, whose nature
it is to reflect deeply, to feel intensely, and to aspire after a high
moral ideal.

If we do not mistake the age we live in, the perplexities and
anxieties of such natures form a very large item in our modern life.

It is said that the Christian religion is losing its hold on society.
On the contrary, we believe there never was a time when faith in
Christianity was so deep and all-pervading, and when it was working in
so many minds as a disturbing force.

The main thing which is now perplexing modern society, is the effort
which is making to reduce the teachings of the New Testament to
actual practice in life and to regulate society by them. There is no
skepticism as to the ends sought by Jesus in human life. Nobody doubts
that love is the fulfilling of the law, and that to do as we would be
done by, applied universally, would bring back the golden age, if ever
such ages were.

But the problem that meets the Christian student, and the practical
person who means to live the Christian life, is the problem of
redemption and of self-sacrifice.

In a world where there is always ruin and misery, where the
inexperienced are ensnared and the blind misled, and where fatal and
inexorable penalties follow every false step, there must be a band of
redeemers, seekers and savers of the lost. There must be those who
sacrifice ease, luxury and leisure, to labor for the restoration of
the foolish and wicked who have sold their birthright and lost their
inheritance; and here is just the problem that our age and day present
to the thoughtful person who, having professed, in whatever church or
creed, to be a Christian, wishes to make a reality of that profession.

The night that Eva had spent in visiting the worst parts of New York
had been to her a new revelation of that phase of paganism which
exists in our modern city life, within sound of hundreds of church
bells of every denomination. She saw authorized as a regular trade,
and protected by law, the selling of that poisoned liquor which
brings on insanity worse than death; which engenders idiocy, and the
certainty of vicious propensities in the brain of the helpless unborn
infant; which is the source of all the poverty, and more than half
the crime, that fills alms-houses and prisons, and of untold miseries
and agonies to thousands of families. She saw woman degraded as the
minister of sin and shame; the fallen and guilty Eve, forever plucking
and giving to Adam the forbidden fruit whose mortal taste brings death
into the world; and her heart had been stirred by the sight of those
multitudes of poor ruined wrecks of human beings, men and women, that
she had seen crowding in to that midnight supper, and by the earnest
pleadings of faith and love that she had heard in the good man's
prayers for them. She recalled his simple faith, his undaunted courage
in thus maintaining this forlorn hope in so hopeless a region, and she
could not rest satisfied with herself, doing nothing to help.

In talking with Mr. James on his prospects, he had said that he very
much wished to enlarge this Home so as to put there some dormitories
for the men who were willing to take the pledge to abandon drinking,
where they could find shelter and care until some kind of work could
be provided for them. He stated further that he wished to connect with
the enterprise a farm in the country where work could be found for
both men and women, of a kind which would be remunerative, and which
might prove self-supporting.

Eva reflected with herself whether she had anything to give or to do
for a purpose so sacred. Their income was already subject to a strict
economy. The little elegancies and adornments of her house were those
that are furnished by thought and care rather than by money. Even with
the most rigorous self-scrutiny, Eva could not find fault with the
home philosophy by which their family life had been made attractive
and delightful, because she said and felt that her house had been
a ministry to others. It had helped to make others stronger, more
cheerful, happier.

But when she brought Maggie away from the Home, she longed to send
back some helpful token to those earnest laborers.

On revising her possessions, she remembered that, once, in the days
when she was a rich and rather self-indulgent daughter of luxury, she
had spent the whole of one quarter's allowance in buying for herself a
pearl cross. It cost her not even a sacrifice, for when with a kiss
or two she confessed her extravagance to her father, he only pinched
her cheek playfully, told her not to do so again, and gave a check for
the amount. There it lies, at this moment, in Eva's hands; and as she
turns it abstractedly round and round, and marks the play of light on
the beautiful pearls, she thinks earnestly what that cross means, and
wonders that she should ever have worn it as a mere bauble.

Does it not mean that man's most generous Friend, the highest,
the purest, the sweetest nature that ever visited this earth, was
agonized, tortured, forsaken, and left to bleed life away, unpitied
