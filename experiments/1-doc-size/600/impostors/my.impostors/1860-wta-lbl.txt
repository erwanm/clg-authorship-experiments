mother," added Paul, proudly. 

" Certainly not. Captain Littleton did not offer 
to give me any thing; only to assist me in get- 
ting work for myself and you." 

" O, well, that's all right." 

" While we have our health and strength, we 
shall not have to ask other help of any one." 

" Of course not." 

'' I hope I am above asking charity, or taking it 
either." 

'' I knew 'you were. What did Captain Little- 
ton say ? " 

" Thanks to the goodness and forethought of 
your father, we are not left entirely destitute," re- 
plied Mrs. Duncan, wiping a tear from her cheek. 

" I didn't know there was any thing left." 

" After paying all the funeral expenses and the 
doctors' bills, I shall have fifty dollars in njoney. 
Your father had no debts."  

" Fifty dollars isn't much, mother, towards sup- 
porting the family. It wouldn't last two months." 




'' That is very true ; we have more than that. 
Three years ago your father had his life insured 
for a thousand dollars, and this sum will be paid 
to me in a few days." 

" I didn't know that," said Paul, greatly sur- 
prised to find they had what seemed to him so 
vast a sum. " We shall get along very well." 

" Your father used to calculate that it cost him 
about eight dollars a week to live, or about four 
hundred dollars a year. If he had had work all 
the year round, he might have saved a very hand- 
some sum, he used to tell me." 

" It will not cost us eight dollars a week now." 

" No ; we must live very prudently ; but if 
it cost us only five, a thousand dollars would last 
but a few years, and what should we do then ? " 

" We must not spend it then." 

" Captain Littleton told me what he thought 
we had better do. This house in which we live 
can be bought for fifteen hundred dollars, though 
the owner has always asked eighteen hundred, 
and ." 



 

" You don't really think of such a thing as 
buying the house ? " interrupted Paul, filled with 
amazement at the magnitude of the idea. 

" That is what Captain Littleton advises me 
to do." 

"But you haven't money enough." 

" I can give a mortgage for five hundred dol- 
lars. The rent of the house is one hundred 
and forty dollars, and Mr. Freeman says he can- 
not afford to let it for any less. Now, if we 
buy it, we can pay a thousand dollars down, 
and we shall owe five hundred, on which we 
shall have to pay the interest, amounting to 
thirty dollars. By this plan, we should have to 
pay out only about fifty dollars a year for interest 
and taxes, or about a dollar a week. In this 
way we can get along on five dollars a week." 

" Buy the house then, by all means, mother. 
Five dollars a week ! Well, I think I shall be 
able to support the family, after all." 

"You, Paul?" exclaimed Mrs. Duncan, with a 
smile. 




" I am sure I can." 

"What do you intend to do?" 

"I don't know yet." 

" Your poor father intended that you should 
enter the High School this fall ; but I suppose that 
cannot be. Captain Littleton said he would get 
you a place where you could have two or three 
dollars a week." 

" I must make more than that, mother," replied 
Paul, shaking his head. 

" You must not be too ambitious. If you get 
two or three dollars a week, you will do very 
well, and that sum will be a great help to me." 

" You heard what father said to me in his 
last moments ? " said Paul, with solemn earnest- 
ness. " He told me to take care of my mother 
and of my brothers and sisters, and I mean to 
do so." 

" But he never had a thought that you could 
earn money enough to support the whole of us. 
You are a. good boy, Paul, but you must not try 
to do too much." 



 

" If we can live on five dollars a week, I am 
almost sure I can earn that." 

" That is a good deal for a boy like you." 

'' I can do it, I know." 

" Captain Littleton said he would find a place 
for you." 

" I shall be very much obliged to him, and 
will take any place I can get ; but I am certain 
before long that I can make five dollars a 
week." 

" Don't think of such a thing. There are a 
great many men who get no more than that. 
You must work your way up, little by little, 
Paul, and one of these days you will obtain a 
good situation." 

" That's just what I mean to do. Little by 
little - that's my motto ; and if I can only get 
hold any where, you may leave the rest to me." 

" You are a good boy, Paul, and you will suc- 
ceed by and by," said Mrs. Duncan, -proudly. "I 
expect to get some work myself next week, and 
I have no doubt we shall do very well." 




'' What work, mother ? " asked Paul, a shadow 
of dissatisfaction passing over his face. 

" Captain Littleton thought he could get me a 
chance to make bags for the flour mills." 

" I don't mean to have you take in work, 
mother. You have enough to do to take care of 
the house and the children." 

"I can- do a good deal besides. Sarah can 
help a great deal about the house, and with what 
we can all do, we shall get along very well in- 
deed. We ought to be very thankful for all the 
blessings that surround us." 

'' We are enough sight better off than I thought," 
replied Paul; "but I don't want to have you 
make a slave of yourself. You used to ' work 
hard enough ; and now, if you are going to take in 
work, you will wear yourself out in a few years." 

" I guess not, Paul. There is somebody knock- 
ing at the door ; go and see who it is." 

Paul went to the door, and the visitor proved 
to be Captain Littleton. 

"I was looking for you, Paul," said he. "I'm 



 

going to give a dinner party to-morrow, and I 
want a mess of perch, fresh from the rocks, by 
twelve o'clock. I want you should go down and 
catch them for me. You always have good luck 
at fishing. Will you do this for me, Paul ? " 
"Yes, sir; certainly I will." 
" I will speak to your mother about it." 
Paul conducted Captain Littleton into the little 
parlor, and called his mother. She was willing 
that he should go, and glad to have him do 
something in return for the gentleman's repeated 
acts of kindness. 

" I will give you twenty cents a dozen for 
them, Paul, and I want at least five dozen," con- 
tinued the captain. 

" He will not charge any thing, sir," added 
Mrs. Duncan." 

'' Not a cent, sir, " repeated Paul. 
" It's a fair trade, young man, and I won't take 
them unless I pay for them." 

" I don't want any pay from you, sir." 

" But I choose to pay you, and you must take 



 

your orders from me in this instance. Have you 
any clams for bait ? " 

" No, sir. I will get some to-niglit." 

" Very well ; you may go and get them now, 
and I will talk to your mother about business." 

Paul took his hat and went down to the 
beach. Embarking in the old boat, he sailed 
over to Tenean, where plenty of clams were to 
be had, and a bucket full was soon procured. 
Like a prudent fisherman, he made all his ar- 
rangements for the next day. First he repaired 
the worn-out sail, then made a new sprit, and 
refitted the tiller to the rudder head. When 
every thing was in ship-shape order about the 
boat, he took out his perch lines, ganged on a new 
hook, and rigged an extra sinker for use in case 
of accident. 

"Going a fishing, Paul?" said John Duncan, 
his brother, a lad of ten, who joined him when 
he had nearly completed his preparations. 

"I'm going down in the morning to get a 
mess of perch for Captain Littleton," 



 

" Let me go with you, Paul ? " 

" You inust go to school." 

" It don't keep." 

" Ask mother, then ; if she is willing, I am." 

" Have you got a line for me ? " 

"Yes." 

John Duncan, for his years, was almost as 
much of a sailor and fisherman as Paul. Both 
of them took to the water like ducks, and seemed 
to understand all about a boat as if by instinct. 
The prospect of a day down below fired the im- 
agination of the " young salt," and he ran up 
the bluff with all his might to obtain the desired 
permission. 

" May I go a-fishing with Paul to-morrow, 
mother?" shouted he, as he rushed into the par- 
lor, without noticing the presence of Captain Lit- 
tleton. 

" We will see about that by and by. Take off 
your cap." 

" How do you do, John ? " said Captain Lit- 
tleton. 



 

" Pretty well," replied John, whose head keeled 
over on the port side, as he discovered the visitor, 
and three fingers found their way into his mouth. 

'' You want to go a-fishing, do you ? " 

"Yes, sir." 

." Do you think it is safe to let him go ? '' 
asked Mrs, Duncan. 

" I ain't afraid, mother," interrupted the young 
hopeful. 

" I know . you are not, and that's one reason 
why I don't like to trust you in the boat." 

"Your boys take to the water in a natural 
way ; and when boys have a decided taste of that 
kind, it isn't of much use to thwart them." 

"I know it isn't; but John has worried my life 
out since he was four years old, for he is always 
in the water." 

" I should use proper precaution with him ; but 
Paul is so good a boatman that I should not be 
afraid to trust him in his care." 

" You may go, John," added Mrs. Duncan. 
'" I have almost made up my mind to let him 



 

live in the water ; but I can't help going to the 
window when he is out on the beach, at least 
twenty times a day, to see if he isn't in trouble." 

"To 'return to Paul," said Captain Littleton, 
resuming the remarks which the entrance of John 
had interrupted. " I have the refusal of a place 
in a lawyer's office, where the salary is two 
dollars and a half a week. It is small pay, but 
it is better than nothing." 

"He expects more than that. It would have 
astonished you to hear him talk a little while 
ago. He is going to assume the whole bur- 
den of supporting the family, and is not willing 
that I should do any thing." 

" He is a smart boy, and ought to have a good 
place." 

" He says he means to make five dollars a 
week ; but that is mere boy-talk." 

" I like his spirit, but he will hardly be expected 
to earn five dollars a week at present. I hope I 
shall be able to find him a better place than the 
ono I spoke of." 



 

'' You are very good, sir ; I shall never be able 
to repay you for your kindness." 

" Dpn't .mention it, ma'am. I am very glad to 
do any thing I can for you. You have made up 
your mind then to purchase the house ? " 

" Yes, sir." 

" I think that's the best thing you can do un- 
der the circumstances. The property is rising in 
value, and in a few years, if you should want to 
sell, it would bring two thousand dollars. I will 
see Freeman as I return, and the papers shall be 
made out immediately." 

"Thank you, sir." 

Captain Littleton took his leave, and Mrs. Dun- 
can was very grateful to him for the friendly in- 
terest he manifested in her affairs. When Paul 
returned to the house, his mother informed him 
that her friend had found a place for him; but 
the young aspirant had got an idea, and made up 
his mind to decline the situation.

CHAPTER V. 

PAUL COOKS HIS OWJST BREAKFAST, AND GOES 
A FISHING. 

About six miles east of Bayville was a rocky 
island, around which perch were abundant. Paul 
had often been there with his father, and was fa- 
miliar with the locality. He knew just where to 
moor his boat to have good luck in fishing, and 
was acquainted with all the channels, currents, 
and bars in the bay. He was not only a skilful 
seaman, but a good pilot, and felt as much at 
home on the bay as in the streets of Bayville. 

It would be low tide in the bay at seven 
o'clock, and Paul made his calculations accord- 
ingly. The best time to fish was on the " young 
flood," or soon after the tide had turnea to come 
in ; and, if the wind should happen to be light or 
contrary, it would take him a long time to run 



 

down to Rock Island, as the place was called ; 
therefore he must go down with the tide. To 
accomplish his purpose it was necessary they; he 
should start by five o'clock in the morning, which 
was an hour before his usual breakfast time. 

He did not sleep very well that night, for the 
great idea to which we have alluded was, creating an 
immense commotion in his mind. He had reasoned 
out the certainty of his being able to support the 
family, and he felt as proud of his great resolu- 
tion as though he had achieved its full fruits. 
When, at last, he dropped asleep, it was only to 
dream of great speculations, and of the satisfac- 
tion he should have in giving his mother money 
enough on Saturday night to pay all the expenses 
of the family for a week. 

He woke very early in the morning, and as he 
jumped out of bed he heard the clock on the 
Town Hall strike four. He did not mean to dis- 
turb his mother, and therefore cautioned John 
not to make any noise. He was not like some 
boys, who growl and grumble at their mothers if 




tlieir meals are not ready when they want them. 
Stealing softly down stairs, he went to the back 
kitcUen, and made a fire in the stove. 

" Now, John, you go down to the boat, and 
bale her out," said he to his brother, as the lat- 
ter joined him. 

" Are you going without any breakfast ? " asked 
John. 

" No ; breakfast will be ready by the time you 
have baled out the boat." 

" You haven't called mother yet ? " 

" I don't mean to do so." 

" Where will you get your breakfast, then ? " 

''I will get it myself." 

"You don't know how to cook," replied John, 
incredulously. 

" You see if I don't ; now go ahead, and 
don't make a noise, or you will wake mother." 

Paul then went down cellar, and brought up a 
few potatoes, which he washed and put into the 
kettle. A piece of pork and a slice of veal were 
deposited in the frying pan, ready to be cooked 



 

at the proper time. The coffee, not omitting the 
important bit of fish skin, was put in the coffee- 
pot, and. operations in that quarter were suspend- 
ed till the water in the tea-kettle should boil. 
Though our hero had never actually performed 
these manoeuvres with his own hands, he had 
seen them executed so many times that he was 
perfectly familiar with the routine. 

Every thing upon the stove was doing very 
well, and he pulled out the table, which he pro- 
ceeded to cover with the proper articles for the 
morning meal. Each article was carefully dis- 
posed in its proper place, for Paul had already 
learned that food tastes better in the midst of 
order and neatness, than when taken in dirt and 
confusion. It is true, -he made some mistakes for 
the want of experience, and was frequently obliged 
to stop and think what articles were required ; 
but when the table was set, he was satisfied with 
its cheerful and neat appearance. By this time 
the tea-kettle was spouting out long jets of 
steam, and the lid was rattling under the influence 



 

of the commotion beneath it. Paul poured a lit- 
tle of the boiling water into the coffee-pot, and 
then came an appalling difficulty — he did not 
know how much to put in, and was not sure that 
he had taken the proper quantity of coffee. At a 
venture he filled the pot half full, and then pro- 
ceeded to cook the meat. After the coffee had 
boiled ten or fifteen minutes, he tested its strength, 
and added more water. He was delighted with 
his success, and when John returned from the 
beach, he was putting the breakfast upon the 
table. 

" Breakfast is ready," said Paul. 

" Did you cook it, though ? " 

'' I did; I told you I could." 

" I'll give up now. Why don't you hire out 
for a cook ? " 

" Perhaps I shall, one of these days." 

" Wouldn't mother's eyes stick out if she should 
happen in about this time ! " 

" I guess not much." 

But they did, for just as the boys were seating 



 

themselves at the table, Mrs. Duncan entgred the 
room. 

'' Why, boys ! what have you been doing ? " 
exclaimed she, astonished at the regularity with 
which every thing seemed to be proceeding in hei 
absence. 

" Only getting something to eat before we go," 
replied Paul. 

" Why didn't you call me ? " 

'' I thought I wouldn't get you up so  early; 
besides, I could get breakfast just as well my- 
self." 

" I declare you are a good cook, Paul, Your 
potatoes and meat look as nice as can be. How is 
your coffee ? Did you put a piece of fish-skin in 
the pot?" 

" Yes, ma'am." 
' '' Did you put any salt on the meat ? " 

" I did ; come, mother, sit down and eat your 
breakfast." 

Mrs. Duncan accepted this polite invitation, and 
seating herself in her accustomed place, began to 


pour oift the coffee. It was clear, and of the right 
strength, and she liberally praised Paul for his 
culinary skill, and declared that her son was a 
jewel about the house. The breakfast seemed 
even better than usual that morning, and our hero 
was as proud as though he had built a meeting 
house. 

'' Come, John, we must bear a hand ; there isn't 
a breath of wind, and it will take us some time 
to make Rock Island," said Paul, as he rose from 
the table. " Have you filled the jug with water ? "
