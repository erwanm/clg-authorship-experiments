Yes, I ask myself if such things can be! I ask 
myself if they were real, all those fervors and all 
that boldness of mine! If it was natural, that way 
that Hived! 

— Oh, and then I look back, and my heart 
grows sick within me. 

So I spend my time, and when I turn and try 
to lose myself in Nietzsche, his mercilessness 
flings me into new despair. 



January i8th. 

I have the terrible gift of insensibihty; and 
I think my insensibility torments me more than 
anything else in the world. 

I have no life, no power, no feeling, natu- 
rally — it is all my will, it is all effort. And now 
that I am not striving, I sink back into a state of 
numbness, of dull, insensible despair. I no longer 
feel anything, I no longer care about anything. 
I pass my time in helpless impotence — and day 
by day I watch a thing creeping upon me as in 
a nightmare. I must go out into the world again 
and slave for my bread ! 

— Oh, then I will feel something, I think! 

Another week and more is gone, and I have 
but a little over four dollars. 

January 20th. 

I have stopped reading Nietzsche. I could 
not stand any more of it. It does not satisfy me. 

It is not merely that I am so weak now, and 
that his mocking goads me. I would have been 
through with him in any case. He is so narrow 
— so one-sided. 

It is reaction from the present, of course, that 
accounts for it. Too much gazing upon the 






world, that has led him to believe that love of 
man necessarily implies compromise. 

There are two words that are absent from his 
writings — they are love and humanity; and so it 
never satisfies you, you are always discontented, 
you have always to correct and supply. 

January 22d. 

Oh why do those publishers take so long! I 
wait and yearn; I grow sick with waiting and 
yearning. 

I never allowed any weakness in my soul be- 
fore; I never made any terms with it. I blamed 
everything upon myself. And now that my 
whole life is weakness and misery, I writhe and 
struggle — I turn back always on myself, suspect- 
ing myself, blaming myself. I can not lay it to 
the world, I can not get into the habit — it is such 
a miserable habit! How many millions there are 
of them — poor, querulous wretches, blaming 
their fate, crying out against the world's injus- 
tice and neglect — crying out against the need of 
working, wishing for this and that — discontent- 
ed, impotent, miserable! Oh my God — and I am 
one of such ! 

I can not bear the sound of my own voice 


when I complain! I hear the world answering 
me — and I take the part of the world! " Why 
don't you be a man and go out and earn your 
way? Why don't you face your fate? You prate 
about your message — what business has a man 
with a message that is too much for him? What 
business have you with weakness — what excuse 
have you for weakness? " 

And so I came to see it. The world is right 
and I am all wrong! And the truth of it burns 
me like an acid in my brain. 

January 24th. 
And all the time my whole being is still rest- 
less with the storms that raged in it last spring! 
I have all those memories, all that poignancy. I 
can not realize it — any of what I was and had — 
but I know it as a fact, a memory, and I crouch 
and tremble, I grow sick with it. 

Why don't they write to me? My money is 
going! 

January 26th. 

The reason that I shudder so at the prospect 

of having to face the world again, is that I have 

no hope. I have no hope! Once I could go out 

into that helHsh market. I could be any man's 



slave, do any drudgery — because I saw a light 
ahead — I saw deliverance — I had a purpose! 

And now what purpose have I — what hope 
have I ? I tell you I am a man in a trap ! I can do 
nothing! I can do no more than if I were walled 
in with iron! 

I say that my business in this world is to be a 
poet! I say that there is only one thing I can do 
— only one way that I can get free — and that is 
by doing my work, by writing books. And I 
have done all that I can do, I have earned my 
freedom — and no one will give it to me! Oh, I 
shall die if I am penned here much longer! 

I eat out my heart, I burn up my very en- 
trails in my frenzies. Set me free! Set me free! 

I thought to-day if I only had a little money 
— if I could only publish that book myself! I can 
not believe that men would not love it — I can 
not — no, you may crush me all you please, but I 
can not! And I would take it and shout it from 
the housetops — I would peddle it on the streets 
— I would make the world hear me! 

— And then I sink back, and I hear the world 
say, " You poor fool! " 


January 28th. 

I have onh' a dollar and a half left! I have 
sat, shuddering and waiting, all that I dare; the 
end is come now, I must look for work to-mor- 
row. It is hke a death-sentence to me. I could 
do nothing to-night. 

January 29th. 

Providence came to help me to-night for 
once ! It snowed to-day and I have been hard at 
w ork again. 

January 30th. 

Some more snow. ]My hands were nearly 
frost-bitten, but I keep at it; for at least it is 
out in the air, and it gives me a little longer 
respite. 

In the afternoon I made up my mind to go 
and see the publishers and ask them if they could 
not read the story at once — it has been a month. 
I saw their literary manager; he said he was go- 
ing to read it himself. 

January 31st. 

More snow again to-daj'. And I have made 
over five dollars. But I have come out of it more 
dead than alive — dulled, dispirited, utterly worn 
out. 



If I could only be an animal for a time. But 
each day of the drudgery only makes me wilder 
with nervousness. 

February ist. 

They regret, of course, and hold the MS. at 
my disposal. I went up to get it this afternoon, 
and half by accident I met the man I had seen be- 
fore. I had a talk with him. He was a very curi- 
ous personage. 

He seemed to have been interested in The 
Captive. " I'll tell you," he said, " you know 
there's really some extraordinary work in that 
poem. I believe that you have it in you to make 
some literature before you get through, Mr. Stir- 
ling." 

" Do you? " I said. 

" Yes," he replied, " I feel pretty sure of it. 
You ask me to tell you about it — so you mustn't 
mind if I speak frankly. And of course it's very 
crude. You haven't found your voice yet, you're 
seeking for mastery, and your work is obviously 
young. Anybody can see in a few lines that it's 
young — it's one of those things like Goetz von 
Berlichingen, or Die Rauber — you tear a passion 
to tatters, you want to rip the universe up the 



back. But of course that wears off by and by; it 
isn't well to take life too seriously, you know, 
and I don't think it'll be long before you come 
to feel that The Captive isn't natural or possible 
— or desirable either." 

The publisher was smoking a cigar. He 
puffed for a moment and then he asked, " What 
are you doing now? " 

" Nothing just at present," said I. 

" I should have supposed you'd be writing an- 
other poem," he replied, — " though of course as 
a matter of fact the wisest thing you can do is to 
wait and learn. Your next book will be entirely 
different, you can be quite sure — you won't be so 
anxious to get hold of all the world and make it 
go your way." 

I smiled feebly. " Possibly not," I said. 

" I'll tell you a story," said the publisher — 
"speaking about youthful aspirations! I was 

talking to Mr. X last night, the author of 

.* You wouldn't think X was the sort 

of man to be reforming the world, would you? 
But he told me about his earliest work, that he 
said he had tucked away in a drawer, and it turned 

* The manuscript names an extremely popular historical 
novel. 









out he was like all other authors. This was a 
socialist story, it seems, and the hero delivered 

fiery speeches six pages long. And X said 

that he had written it and taken it to a publisher, 
expecting to upset the world a week after it ap- 
peared, but that he never could get anybody to 
publish it, and gave it up finally and went into 
journalism. The funny part of it was that he had 
sent it here, and when he told me about it, I re- 
membered looking it over and writing him just 
about what I'm telling you." 

The publisher smoked for a moment or two. 
" You see, Mr. Stirling," he said at last, " he 
had to wait ten years before he ' arrived.' So 
you must not be discouraged. Have you read 
his book? " 

" No, I have not." 

" It is a very pretty piece of work — it's been 
many months since it came out, but they say it's 
still selling in the thousands. Don't get dis- 
couraged, Mr. Stirling, keep at it, because you 
have real talent, I assure you." 

I rose to go, and he shook my hand. " Take 

my advice," he said, " and write something 

more practicable than a tragedy. But of course 

don't forget in any case that we shall always 



be very happy to read anything of yours at 
any time." 

— I walked down the street meditating. I 
will get over it again, of course; but to-night I 
sat in the dark and the cold, shivering. And I 
asked myself if it must not be so after all. " Is it 
true, the thing that I did; is it natural F " I said. 
" Or must it not be exaggerated and crude, as 
they all tell me! And uninteresting! — What is 
the use of it? I tormented myself that way and 
tore myself to pieces, but it does not stir any one 
else." 

Ah, of course it's all dead in me — and I'm 
prepared to believe anything they tell me! It's 
overwrought, it's young, it's pitched in too high 
a key, it's strained and unnatural, it takes life too 
seriously! Certainly at any rate they are right 
that I shall never, never do the same thing again. 

But unfortunately I don't feel like writing 
anything else. I don't know anything about his- 
torical novels. 

— I would have read some of the poem again 
to-night, but I'm too discouraged. I am tired 
of it. I know it by heart, and it doesn't take hold 
of me. 







I have been too long among men, I groan. 
I see their point of view too well! 

Why, there are things in that book that when 
I read them now make me shudder. I have hardly the courage to offer it to any one else to read. 
I don't know any one to take it to, besides. 

God, I'm so unhappy! 

February 3d. 
To-day an idea occurred to me, one that 
should have occurred before. Once upon a time 
I was introduced to the editor of the . Per- 
haps he will not remember it, I said. But any- 
how, why not try? I will take him The Captive 
— perhaps he can use it in the magazine — who 
knows? 

Iknew nothing better to do, so I went there. 
He was very polite — he did remember my face. 
He was fearfully busy, it seemed. He did not 
think there was much likelihood of a magazine's 
publishing a blank-verse tragedy; but I told him 
how I had worked, and he said he'd read it. 

And so there's one chance more! 

My poor, foolish heart is always ready to 
tremble with new hope. But faith in that book 
was so ground into it! 


— I asked him to read it at once, I explained 
that I was in great haste. I think he understood 
what I meant. My clothes show it. 

I have been hoarding my money — counting 
every cent. I dread the world so! Now that I 
am so broken, so laden with misery, it sounds 
about me as one jeer of mockery. But I shall 
have to be hunting a place soon — you never can 
tell how long it may take you, and the chances are 
so terrible. 

I will not do anything until I hear from this 
one man, however. He promised to let me know 
in a week. 

I did not see him at the publisher's — he has 
another office besides. He had huge piles of pa- 
pers and books about him; he is an important 
man, I guess; can it be that he will be the one to 
save me? 

I think: "Oh if he knew, he would!" I 
find myself thinking that of all the world — if 
I could only make them understand! Poor, 
impotent wretch, if I could only find the 
word! 

— Or is it simply my blind egotism that 
makes me think that? 







February 6th. 

I do not think that what I write can be of 
much interest. It must be monotonous — all this 
despair, this endless crying out, this endless repe- 
tition of the same words, the same thought. 

Yet that is all that my life is! That is just 
what I do every day — whenever I am not read- 
ing a book to forget myself. 

It is all so simple, my situation! That is the 
most terrible thing about it, it is the same thing 
always and forever. 

I have lived so much agony through this 
thing — it would not startle me if I saw that my 
hair had turned white. I know I feel like an old 
man. I am settled down into mournfulness, into 
despair; I can do nothing but gaze back — I have 
lived my life — I have spent my force — I am tired 
and sick. 

I! I! I! — do you get tired of hearing it? 
It was not always like that; once you read a 
little about a book. 

February 8th. 
This is the fifth day. I am counting the days, 
I have been counting the very hours. He said 



he would be a week. And I — only think of it — 
I have but two dollars and sixty cents left! 

Hurry up ! Hurry up ! 

— And then I say with considerable scorn in 
my voice: " Haven't you learned enough about 
that manuscript yet? And about publishers 
yet?" 

February loth. 

Just imagine ! I went to see him to-day, and 
he stared at me. " Why, sure enough, Mr. Stir- 
hng! — It had slipped my mind entirely! " 

I have learned to bear things. I asked him 
calmly to let me know as soon as possible. He 
said: "I am honestly so rushed that I do not 
know where to turn. But I will do the best I 
possibly can." 

I said — poor, pitiful cringing, is it not ter- 
rible? — that I'd be up his way again in three 
days, and did he think he could have it read 
by then. He said he was not sure, but that 
he'd try. 

And so I went away. Now I have two dollars 
and twenty-three cents. I have to pay my rent 
to-morrow, and that will leave me a dollar and a 
half. I can make that do me seven or eight days 
— I have one or two things at home. I'll wait 






the three days — and then I'll have to set out in 
earnest to find something to do. 

Oh, the horror of not knowing if you can pay 
your next week's room rent in this fearful city! 

February nth. 
I sat and looked at myself to-day. I said: 
" When a soul is crushed like this, can it ever get 
up again? Can it ever be the same, no matter 
what happens? Don't you see the fact, that 
you've been tamed and broken — that you've 
given in! And how will you ever rise from the 
shame of it, how will you ever forget it? All this 
skulking and trembling — how will you ever dare 
look yourself in the face again! Will not it mock 
your every effort? Why, you poor wretch, 
you've got a broken back! " 

February 12th. 

And to-morrow again I must go there, trem- 
bling and nervous, hanging on a word! 

There is not much sense in it, but I have 
learned to hate all men who have ease and power. 

February 13th. 
I knew it! I could have told it beforehand. 
" I am awfully sorry, Mr. Stirling, but it is no 

use talking, I simply can not! I will write you 
just as soon as ever I get it read." 

And so I came out. I had a dollar and twenty 
cents. My rent would be due in four days again. 
So even if I got some work at once I should have 
to pawn something. 

— Thus I began my search for a situation. 
I could not choose — I was willing to take any- 
thing. 

I fear I look like a tramp; but I have several 
letters from places where I have worked. Still, I 
could not find anything. I have tramped all 
day until I could hardly move. I bought a 
paper, but everything advertised was gone by 
that time. 

If it would only snow again, so that I could 
shovel some more! 

February 14th. 

Again I have been pacing the streets the 
whole endless day, beaten back and rebuffed at 
every turn. I have been drilled for this, this is 
the climax! First take every gleam of heart out 
of me, and then set me to pacing the streets in 
the cold, to be stared at and insulted by every 
kind of a man ! 

And still nothing to do. 






February 15th. 
I take my lunch with me — I have cut myself 
down to twenty cents a day for food. I walk and 
walk, and I am so hungry I can not do on less 
than that. I have but sixty cents left to-night. 
I failed again to-day. 

February i6th. 

It is not as desperate as it sounds, because I 
have a few books and things that I can sell — I do 
not believe that I will actually starve — I have 
always done my work well, and have gotten 
references. But O God, the shame of it — the 
endless, heapedrup bitterness! 

I have sunk into a beast of burden. I trudge 
on with my mind torpid — I take whatever comes 
to me, and go on mechanically. Oh it cows me, 
it wears me down! I have learned to bear any- 
thing — anything! A man might kick me and I 
would not mind. 

I think I went to fifty places yesterday. 
Nothing to do — nothing. To-day is Sunday, but 
I tried even to-day. I came home to get some 
dinner. — I might have been a porter in a hotel, 
and carried trunks — that was my one chance. 
But I have not the physical power for that. 


— And then after all — toward evening — when 
I was so tired I was almost wild — I had an offer 
at last! And guess what it was — of all the things 
that I had made up my mind I could not bear 
— to be a waiter! 

It is, I believe, what a man should call a rare 
opportunity. It is a fairly good restaurant just 
ofif Broadway; and I get ten dollars and tips. 
Poor me! My heart bounded for a moment, and 
then I asked myself. And what do you want with 
money any more? I took the place, and I am to 
begin the day after to-morrow. I am so tired I 
can hardly move. 

February 17th. 

Was it not irony? I have watched day by day
