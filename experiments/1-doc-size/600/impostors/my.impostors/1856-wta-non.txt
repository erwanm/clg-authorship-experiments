 

out of the ditch on the preceding week, and he had 
good reason to believe that he should not be regarded 
with much favor. Tom was malicious and revengeful, 
and our hero was satisfied that the blow which had 
prostrated him in the ditch would not be forgotten 
till it had been atoned for. He was prepared, there- 
fore, for any disagreeable scene which might occur. 

There was another circumstance also which ren- 
dered the bully's presence decidedly unpleasant at this 
time an event that had occurred during his absence, 
the particulars of which he had received from his 
mother. 

Tom's father, who was a poor man and addicted to 


intemperance, had lost ten dollars. He had brought 
it home, and, as he affirmed, placed it in one of the 
bureau drawers. The next day it could not be found. 
Spicer, for some reason, was satisfied that Tom had 
taken it ; but the boy stoutly and persistently denied 
it. No money was found upon him, however, and it 
did not appear that he had spent any at the stores in 
Riverdale Centre. 

The affair created some excitement in the vicinity, 
for Spicer made no secret of his suspicions, and pub- 
licly accused Tom of the theft. He did not get much 
sympathy from any except his pot companions ; for 
there was no evidence but his bare and unsupported 
statement to substantiate the grave accusation. Tom 
had been in the room when the money was placed in 
the drawer, and, as his father asserted, had watched 
him closely while he deposited the bills under the 
clothing. No one else could have taken it. These 
were the proofs. But people generally believed that 
Spicer had carried no money home, especially as it 
was known that he was intoxicated on the night in 
question ; and that the alleged theft was only a ruse 
to satisfy certain importunate creditors. 



 

Every body knew that Tom was bad enough to 
steal, even from his father ; . from which my readers 
can understand that it is an excellent thing to have a 
good reputation. Bobby know that he would lie and 
use profane language ; that he spent his Sundays by 
the river, or in roaming through the woods ; and that 
he played truant from school as often as the fear 
of the rod would permit ; and the boy that would do 
all these things certainly would steal if he got a good 
chance. Our hero's judgment, therefore, of the case 
was not favorable to the bully, and he would have 
thanked him to stay away from the river while he 
was there. 

" Hallo, Bob ! How are you ? ' shouted Tom, 
when he had come within hailing distance. 

" Very well," replied Bobby, rather coolly. 

" Been to Boston, they say." 

" Yes." 

" Well, how did you like it ? " continued Tom, as 
he seated himself on the rock near our hero. 

" First rate." 

" Been to work there ? ' 

"No." 




" What have you been doing? ' 

" Travelling about." - 

" What doing ? " 

" Selling books." 

" Was you, though? Did you sell any? " 

" Yes, a few." 

" How many? ' 

" 0, about fifty." 

" You didn't, though did you ? How much did 
you make ? ' 

" About fifteen dollars." 

" By jolly ! You are a smart one, Bobby. There 
are not many fellows that would have done that." 

" Easy enough," replied Bobby, who was not a little 
surprised at this warm commendation from one whom 
he regarded as his enemy. 

" You had to buy the books first didn't you ? ' 
asked Tom, who began to manifest a deep interest in 
the trade. 

" Of course ; no one will give you the books." 

" What do you pay for them? " 

" I buy them so as to make a profit on them," an- 
swered Bobby, who, like a discreet merchant, was not 
disposed to be too communicative. 




" That business would suit me first rate." 

''It is pretty hard work." 

" I don't care for that. Don't you believe I could 
do something in this line ? ' 

" I don't know ; perhaps you could." 

" Why not, as well as you ? ' 

This was a hard question ; and, as Bobby did not 
wish to be uncivil, he talked about a big pout he 
hauled in at that moment, instead of answering it. 
He was politic, and deprecated the anger of the bully ; 
so, though Tom plied him pretty hard, he did not re- 
ceive much satisfaction. 

" You see, Tom," said he, when he found that his 
companion insisted upon knowing the cost of the 
books, " this is a publisher's secret ; and I dare say 
they would not wish every one to know the cost of 
books. We sell them for a dollar apiece." 

" Humph ! You needn't be so close about it. I'll 
bet I can find out." 

" I have no doubt you can ; only you see I don't 
want to tell what I am not sure they would be will- 
ing I should tell." 

Tom took a slate pencil from his pocket and 




commenced ciphering on the smooth rock upon which 
he sat. 

" You say you sold fifty books ? ' 

"Yes." 

" Well ; if you made fifteen dollars out of fifty, 
that is thirty cents apiece." 

Bobby was a little mortified when he perceived that 
he had unwittingly exposed the momentous secret. 
He had not given Tom credit for so much sagacity 
as he had displayed in his inquiries ; and as he had 
fairly reached his conclusion, he was willing he 
should have the benefit of it. 

" You sold them at a dollar apiece. Thirty from 
a hundred leaves seventy. They cost you seventy 
cents each didn't they ? ' 

" Sixty-seven," replied Bobby, yielding the point. 

" Enough said, Bob ; I am going into that business, 
any how." 

" I am willing." 

" Of course you are ; suppose we go together," 
suggested Tom, who had not used all this conciliation 
without having a purpose in view. 

" We could do nothing together." 



 

" I should like to go out with you just once, only 
to see how it is done." 

"You can find out for yourself, as I did." 

" Don't be mean, Bob." 

" Mean ? I am not mean." 

" I don't say you are. We have always been good 
friends, you know." 

Bobby did not know it ; so he looked at the other 
with a smile which expressed all he meant to say. 

" You hit me a smart dig the other day, I know ; 
but I don't mind that. I was in the wrong then, 
and I am willing to own it," continued Tom, with an 
appearance of humility. 

This was an immense concession for Tom to make, 
and Bobby was duly affected by it. Probably it was 
the first time the bully had ever owned he was in 
the wrong. 

" The fact is, Bob, I always liked you ; and you 
know I licked Ben Dowse for you." 

" That was two for yourself and one for me ; be- 
sides, I didn't want Ben thrashed." 

" But he deserved it. Didn't he tell the master 
you were whispering in school?' 




" I was whispering ; so hs told the truth." 

" It was mean to blow on a fellow, though." 

" The master asked him if I whispered to him ; of 
course he ought not to lie about it. But he told of 
you at the same time." 

" I know it ; but I wouldn't have licked him on 
my own account." 

" Perhaps you wouldn't." 

" I know I wouldn't. But, I say, Bobby, where 
do you buy your books ? ' 

" At Mr. Bayard's, in Washington Street." 

" He will sell them to me at the same price 
won't he ? " 

" I don't know." 

" When are you going again ? ' 

" Monday." 

"Won't you let me go with you, Bob? " 

" Let you ? Of course you can go where you 
please ; it is none of my business." 

Bobby did not like the idea of having such a co- 
partner as Tom Spicer, and he did not like to tell 
him so. If he did, he would have to give his reasons 
for declining the proposition, and that would make 
Tom mad, and perhaps provoke him to quarrel. 



 

The fish bit well, and in an hour's time Bobby 
had a mess. As he took his basket and walked home, 
the young ruffian followed him. He could not get 
rid of him till he reached the gate in front of the 
little black house ; and even there Tom begged him 
to stop a few moments. Our hero was in a hurry, 
and in the easiest manner possible got rid of this as- 
pirant for mercantile honors. 

We have no doubt a journal of Bobby's daily life 
would be very interesting to my young readers ; but 
the fact that some of his most stirring adventures are 
yet to be related admonishes me to hasten forward 
more rapidly. 

On Monday morning Bobby bade adieu to his 
mother again, and started for Boston. He fully ex- 
pected to encounter Tom on the way, who, he was 
afraid, would persist in accompanying him on his 
tour. As before, he stopped at Squire Lee's, to bid 
him and Annie good by. 

The little maiden had read "The Wayfarer" more 
than half through, and was very enthusiastic in her 
expression of the pleasure she derived from it. She 
promised to send it over to his house when she had 





 

finished it, and hoped he would bring his stock to 
Riverdale, so that she might again replenish her 
library. Bobby thought of something just then, and 
the thought brought forth a harvest on the following 
Saturclav, when he returned. 



When he had shaken hands with the squire and 
was about to depart, he received a piece of news 
which gave him food for an hour's serious reflection. 

" Did you hear about Tom Spicer ? " asked Squire 
Lee. 

" No, sir ; what about him ? ' 

" Broken his arm." 

" Broken his arm ! Gracious ! How did it hap- 
pen? " exclaimed Bobby, the more astonished because 
he had been thinking of Tom since he had left home. 

" He was out in the woods yesterday, where boys 
should not be on Sundays, and, in climbing a tree 
after a bird's nest, he fell to the ground." 

" I am sorry for him," replied Bobby, musing. 

" So am I ; but if he had been at home, or at 
church, where he should have been, it would not 
have happened. If I had any boys, I would lock 
them up in their chambers if I could not keep them 
at home Sundays." 



 

" Poor Tom ! " mused Bobby, recalling the conver- 
sation he had had with him on Saturday, and then 
wishing that he had been a little more pliant with him. 

" It is too bad ; but I must say I am more sorry 
for his poor mother than I am for him," added the 
squire. " However, I hope it will do him good, and 
be a lesson he will remember as long as he lives." 

Bobby bade the squire and Annie adieu again, and 
resumed his journey towards the railroad station. 
His thoughts were busy with Tom Spicer's case. 
The reason why he had not joined him, as he ex- 
pected and feared he would, was now apparent. 
He pitied him, for he realized that he must endure a 
great deal of pain before he could again go out ; but 
he finally dismissed the matter with the squire's sage 
reflection, that he hoped the calamity would be a 
good lesson to him. 

The young merchant did not walk to Boston this 
time, for he had come to the conclusion that, in 
the six hours it would take him to travel to the city 
on foot, the profit on the books he could sell would 
be more than enough to pay his fare, to say nothing 
of the fatigue and the expense of shoe leather. 



Before noon he was at B again, as busy as 

ever in driving his business. The experience of the 
former week was of great value to him. He visited 
people belonging to all spheres in society, and, though 
he was occasionally repulsed or treated with incivility, 
he was not conscious in a single instance of offending 
any person's sense of propriety. 

He was not as fortunate as during the previous 
week, and it was Saturday noon before he had sold 
out the sixty books he carried with him. The net 
profit for this week was fourteen dollars, with which 
he was abundantly pleased. 

Mr. Bayard again commended him in the warmest 
terms for his zeal and promptness. Mr. Timmins was 
even more civil than the last time, and when Bobby 
asked the price of Moore's Poems, he actually offered 
to sell it to him for thirty-three per cent, less than 
the retail price. The little merchant was on the point 
of purchasing it, when Mr. Bayard inquired what he 
wanted. 

"I am going to buy this book," replied Bobby. 

"Moore's Poems: " 

"Yes, sir." 



 

Mr. Bayard took from a glass case an elegantly 
bound copy of the same work morocco, full gilt 
and handed it to our hero. 

" I shall make you a present of this. Are you an 
admirer of Moore ? ' 

" No, sir ; not exactly that is, I don't know 
much about it ; but Annie Lee does, and I want to 
get the book for her." 

Bobby's cheeks reddened as he turned the leaves 
of the beautiful volume, putting his head down to the 
page to hide his confusion. 

" Annie Lee ? " said Mr. Bayard with a quizzing 
smile. " I see how it is. Rather young, Bobby." 

" Her father has been very good to me and to my 
mother ; and so has Annie, for that matter. Squire 
Lee would be a great deal more pleased if I should 
make Annie a present than if I made him one. I 
feel grateful to him, and I want to let it out some 
how." 

" That's right, Bobby ; always remember your 
friends. Timmins, wrap up this book." 

Bobby protested with all his might ; but the bookseller
insisted that he should give Annie this beautiful 
edition, and he was obliged to yield the point. 

That evening he was at the little black house again, 
and his mother examined his ledger with a great deal 
of pride and satisfaction. That evening, too, another 
ten dollars was indorsed on the note, and Annie re- 
ceived that elegant copy of Moore's Poems. 



 



CHAPTER XIV. 
IN WHICH BOBBY'S AIR CASTLE is UPSET, AND 

TOM! SPICER TAKES TO THE WOODS. 

DURING the next four weeks Bobby visited various 
places in the vicinity of Boston ; and at the end of 
that time, he had paid the whole of the debt he owed 
Squire Lee. He had the note in his memorandum 
book, and the fact that he had achieved his first great 
purpose afforded him much satisfaction. Now he 
owed no man any thing, and he felt as though he 
could hold up his head among the best people in the 
world. 

The little black house was paid for, and Bobby was 
proud that his own exertions had released his mother 
from her obligation to her hard creditor. Mr. Hard- 
hand couM no longer insult and abuse her. 

The apparent results which Bobby had accom- 
plished, however, were as nothing compared with 




the real results. He had developed those energies 
of character which were to make him, not only a 
great business man, but a useful member of society. 
Besides, there was a moral grandeur in his humble 
achievements which was more worthy of consideration 
than the mere worldly success he had obtained. Mo- 
tives determine the character of deeds. That a boy 
of thirteen should display so much enterprise and 
energy was a great thing ; but that it should be dis- 
played from pure, unselfish devotion to his mother 
was a vastly greater thing. Many great achievements 
are morally insignificant, while many of which the 
world never hears mark the true hero. 

Our hero was not satisfied with what he had done, 
and far from relinquishing his interesting and profit- 
able employment, his ambition suggested new and 
wider fields of success. As one ideal, brilliant and 
glorious in its time, was reached, another more bril- 
liant and more glorious presented itself, and demanded 
to be achieved. The little black house began to appear 
rusty and inconvenient; a coat of white paint.would 
marvellously improve its appearance ; a set of nice 
Paris-green blinds would make a palace of it ; and a 



 

neat fence around it would positively transform the 
place into a paradise. Yet Bobby was audacious 
enough to think of these things, and even to promise 
himself that they should be obtained. 

In conversation with Mr. Bayard a few days be- 
fore, that gentleman had suggested a new field of 
labor ; and it had been arranged that Bobby should 
visit the State of Maine the following week. On the 
banks of the Kennebec were many wealthy and im- 
portant towns, where the intelligence of the people 
created a demand for books. This time the little 
merchant was to take two hundred books, and be 
absent until they were all sold. 

On Monday morning he started bright and early 
for the railroad station. As usual, he called upon 
Squire Lee, and informed Annie that he should proba- 
bly be absent three or four weeks. She hoped no 
accident would happen to him, and that his journey 
would be crowned with success. Without being 
sentimental, she was a little sad, for Bobby was a 
great friend of hers. That elegant copy of Moore's 
Poems had been gratefully received, and she was so 
fond of the bard's beautiful and touching melodies, 

that she could never read any of them without think- 
ing of the brave little fellow who had given her the 
volume ; which no one will consider very remarkable, 
even in a little miss of twelve. 

After he had bidden her and her father adieu, 
he resumed his journey. Of course he was thinking 
with all his might ; but no one need suppose he was 
wondering how wide the Kennebec River was, or how 
many books he should sell in the towns upon its 
banks. Nothing of the kind ; though it is enough 
even for the inquisitive to know that he was thinking 
of something, and that his thoughts were very inter- 
esting, not to say romantic. 

" Hallo, Bob ! " shouted some one from the road 
side.

Bobby was provoked ; for it is sometimes very un- 
comfortable to have a pleasant train of thought inter- 
rupted. The imagination is buoyant, ethereal, and 
elevates poor mortals up to the stars sometimes. It 
was so with Bobby. He was building up some kind 
of an air castle, and had got up in the clouds amidst 
the fog and moonshine, and that aggravating voice 
brought him down, slap, upon terra firma. 



 

He looked up and saw Tom Spicer seated upon the 
fence. In his hand he held a bundle, and had evi- 
dently been waiting some time for Bobby's coming. 

He had recovered from the illness caused by his 
broken arm, and people said it had been a good les- 
son for him, as the squire hoped it would be. Bobby 
had called upon him two or three times during his 
confinement to the house ; and Tom, either truly re- 
pentant for his past errors, or lacking the opportunity 
at that time to manifest his evil propensities, had 
stoutly protested that he had " turned over a new leaf," 
and meant to keep out of the woods on Sunday, stop 
lying and swearing, and become a good boy. 

Bobby commended his good resolutions, and told 
him ty3 would never want friends while he was true to 
himself. The right side, he declared, was always the 
best side. He quoted several instances of men, whose 
lives he had read in his Sunday school books, to show 
how happy a good man may be in prison, or when all 
the world seemed to forsake him. 

Tom assured him that he meant to reform and be 
a good boy ; and Bobby told him that when any one 
meant to turn over a new leaf, it was " now or never."
