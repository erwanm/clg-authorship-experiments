But scarcely were the words out of my mouth, when the 
savages burst forth from all parts of the forest in such 
overpowering numbers that it seemed as if the whole pop- 
ulation of the island were resolved upon our destruction. 
They were armed with spears and shields, and made the 
most frantic gestures. 

" My friends," I cried, when I comprehended our danger, 
" make for the vessel as quickly as possible. If they suc- 
ceed in cutting us off from it we are lost." 

We began to run with all our might, and most of us 
reached our destination in safety ; others sprang into the 
stream and swam down the river. The savages were so 
close behind us that, before we pushed off, several of our 
people had perished by the spears of their blood-thirsty 



 

assailaats. The sails were stretched out like a roof over, 
the deck, and it seemed almost impossible to draw up the 
anchor. While working at it we fought bravely with our 
two axes, and killed several of the savages, who boldly 
attempted to get on board. Our ship-baker, a tall, strong 
man, particularly distinguished himself by his courage in 
using an old rusty sword. 

" Now cut the rope," I cried to him, but his weapon was 
not sharp enough. I sprang to his side, and drawing the 
rope upon the deck, we quickly severed it, and pusled'off 
from the shore. The savages rushed into the water after 
us, but they lost their footing on the steep bank, and were 
obliged to give up the chase. 

We now picked up our people, wlio were swimming 
down the river, and, as a favorable wind was blowing from 
the land, set sail. The breakers, which had nearly over- 
whelmed us in first approaching the shore, were passed 
through now without much difficulty, and we thus defeated 
the expectations of the savages, who were all collected 
upon a projecting point of land, awaiting our destruction. 

Our joy at our fortunate delivery from so imminent a 
danger, was embittered by the suffering 'of our poor baker, 
whose countenance now began to be much discoloured. 
He had received a slight wound from a spear in his side, of 
which at first he took no notice, but as the spear was 
poisoned, it began to grow black, and inflamed in a few 
moments. I cut out all the flesh that seemed to be afieo 
ted, but I gave him needless pain, for he died shortlv after- 
ward in' the greatest agony, and we threw the body into 
the sea. 



When we numbered over our men we found that sixteen 
were missing ; eleven had perished in our flight, the baker 
and the four who had remained in the village, and who had 
probably fallen victims to their imprudence during the 
night. I had to thank them, however, for my safety, as 
if all five had attempted to return, we should undoubtedly 
have fallen a prey to the savages, from whom I had been 
So wonderfully preserved. 

VI. 

We now sailed rapidly along the coast, before the wind ; 
the provisions which we had with us comprised only eighl; 
fowls and some rice — rather a moderate supply for fifty 
men. It was soon exhausted, and as the sea afibrded us 
no food, we were obhged to land in the first bay that we 
discovered. Not far from the shore a crowd of natives 
was assembled, but as they instantly took to flight, we 
could not ask them for provisions. Meanwhile we found 
excellent water to drink, which we were very glad of, and 
on the shore of the bay quantities of small oysters, with 
which, when our hunger was satisfied, we filled our pock- 
ets. A hatfull of pepper, which I had bought at our first 
landing-place, stood us in good stead in helping us to digest 
this food. 

We soon pushed off again and hold out more to sea, but 
we had not proceeded far when tha wind rose and soon 
increased to a storm; we drew in the sails, spread them 
over the deck, crept under them, and resigned ourselves to 
the waves. Towards morning, the storm abated, and we 
set sail again. At day-break we discovered before us three 



 

amall islands, upon which we determined to land, although 
they appeared to be uninhabited. We reached the nearest 
the same day and found fresh water, of which we stood in 
great need. We saw here also, great bamboo reeds as 
thick as a man's wrist. We cut these down, cutting 
througL one of the solid knobs at the bottom, filled them 
with water and stopped them up with a cork at the top. 
Thus we obtained quite a supply of fresh water ; but 
although we explored the whole island, we found no fruits 
or living creatures, and we were obliged to contend Cif- 
eelves with the cabbage-like leaves of the palm tree. 

One day I left my companions, who wore lying on the 
ground at the foot of the mountain, and iiiounted to its 
summit, to endeavor to discover some spot which might 
be inhabited or have been visited before, for all the hopes 
of the crew rested upon me alone. But as I had never 
been in these seas before, and had no compass or any other 
instruments so necessary to the mariner, I could not decide 
what course we should take to arrive at Java. When I 
had reached the summit, I saw around me nothing but sky 
and sea, not a trace of land. As I always had in my 
Borest need, turned to God, I did it now, fell upon my 
knees and prayed him earnestly to open the eyes of my 
spirit, that I might discover the true path of safety for 
myself and my companions. I then arose to descend 
again, and cast my eyes around me once more. Then it 
seemed to me that some clouds on my right hand were 
dispersing, and in a little while the atmosphere became so 
dear that I could discern in the far distance, two high blue 
mountains. I now suddenly remembered that at home T 



 

had heard a traveller from the East Indies, say that in 
approaching Java from Europe, the island could be recog- 
nized by two mountains on its western extremity, which 
looked blue in the distance. But we had come along the 
left coast of Sumatra to the island where we now were, 
and these mountains were upon the right. I saw distinctly 
between them an empty space and could discover no land 
in the back ground ; as I knew that the straits of Sunda sep- 
arated Java from Sumatra, I felt confident that I had disr 
covered the right way, and descended the mountain, to 
impart my discovery to Hein Eol. 

" Your supposition," said he joyfully, " appears to me 
perfectly correct; let us immediately collect the crew and 
prepare to take the direction you propose." 

We all hastened our preparations, and as the wind was 
favorable, we set sail the same day, and steered directly 
for the strait that I had discovered. At midnight we saw 
in the distance a glimmering light, and thought at first 
that it must be the signal light of some vessel, but as a 
second soon appeared in almost the same place, we could 
not but think that we were near the land. At day-break 
the wind left us entirely, for we were already upon the 
inner coast of Java. A sailor, whom I sent to the mast- 
head to look roimd, cried out, " I see a quantity of ships," 
and immediately counted thirty-three of them. We were 
filled with inexpressible joy, and most of our men began 
to spring and dance like children. As the calm continued, 
they seized the oars and rowed to the place where the fleet 
lay at anchor. 

We soon recognized the Dutch flag, and thanked Grod 




that we were surrounded by countrymen. The commandej 
of the squadron, Frederick Houtman, of Alkmaar, was 
standing in the prow of his vessel, and, attracted by ou* 
curious sails, examined us through his spy-glass ; not being 
able to understand the strange appearance, he sent a boat 
out to us to know who we were, and whence we came. 
The men in this boat had sailed with us from Holland in 
another ship ; they instantly recognized us, and took Heia 
Rol and myself to the admiral's vessel. He received us 
most cordially, carried us into the cabin, and without delay 
had the table covered with a hearty meal for us. When 
I saw the bread and the other food, I was so much 
affected that the tears rolled down my cheeks, and I could 
scarcely eat. In the meantime my men had arrived, and 
had been divided among the other vessels, where they met 
with the greatest kindness. 

After the admiral had listened with astonishment to our 
adventures, he sent us in a yacht to Batavia, the capital 
of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies. We arrived 
on the following morning, presented ourselves before the 
Governor-general, Jan Pieters Coen, and related the story 
of our sufferings to him. 

" Who can be blamed — it was a great misfortune," he 
said drily, after he had heard us to the end without once 
interrupting us. Then he asked us concerning several 
incidents of our voyage. 

" Who can be blamed — it was a great misfortune," he 
repeated again, just as drily, after we had answered his 
questions. 



 

Then he had a golden goL*».t brought to him, and said 
somewhat more cordially : 

" Captain, I wish better luck to you for the future, and 
drink your health. Tou should remember, all your life- 
time, the mercy that has been shown to you, for the Al- 
mighty has repeatedly spared your life when you ha,d given 
yourself up for lost." Then drinking to the health of Hein 
Eol, he added, " Remain as guests in my house Until I can 
provide further for you." 

In the course of a fortnight he made me captain, and 
Hein Rol the supercargo, of a vessel of thirty-two guns. 
We thanked him most heartily, and were not a little 
rejoiced that we two, who had stood by each other in mis 
fortune, were again serving in the same vessel. 




On an uncomfortable evening, when the fog was bo 
thick that we could scarcely see the end of the bowsprit, 
I was walking backwards and forwards on the deck of my 
vessel, which was steering for the island of the Green 
Mountains, to take ia a cargo of salt, oppressed by an 
inexplicable terror which quite overcame my better judg- 
ment. No one on board was thinking of danger, and the 
man at the helm was just calling " ten o'clock," when 
retired to my cabin. Soon after I heard ominous sounds 
among the men on watch, and as I hastened upon deck I 
was greeted by a piercing cry. At first I thought of 
nothing but a sudden gale of wind, and was about to issue 
the necessary orders, when I perceived breakers foaming 
and raging on our left. As none, however, were to be seen 
ahead, I hoped to escape even this danger, and ordered the 
ftnchor to be in readiness ; but this hope vanished utterly 
when the vessel was driven by the current and a mighty 
wave directly towards the breakers, and I saw she must be 
vrrecked. We dropped our largest anchor, and drew in all 
sail, but wave upon wave urged us forward and we were 
driven upon the saud with such a shock that the crew 
were prostrated upon the deck. 

I knew now that there was no hope for the ship, which 
must soon fill with water, and instantly I gave orden to 




 

have all the provisions, that could be got at, brought upon 
deck, and we then emptied several wine casks, that they 
might hold the water drawn from the hogsheads on board. 
The waves broke over our bows, and swept the forward 
deck, but we succeeded in launching both the long and 
small boat, and had loaded the former with five casks of 
water, as many of wine, three casks of biscuits, and four 
others with salt meat, besides books, charts, nautical instru- 
ments, and clothes, before the day dawned and allowed us 
to discover our proximity to the land ; as I found it quite 
near, I secured one end of a stout cable to the mast of the 
ship, and the other to our small boat, into which I, with 
one of the crew, descended on the side of the vessel where 
the fury of the waves was broken. In pushing off we were 
perfectly overwhelmed in the boiling, angry flood, and im- 
mediately driven forwards more than a hundred yards ; 
the foaming breakers only now and then allowed us a short 
breathing space, but at last we were with our boat hurled 
upon a low sandy shore. 

My first care, after recovering from the shock, was to 
bale out the boat and drag it high up upon the shore. For- 
tunately, the cable was still secured to it, and we fastened 
it securely by means of a part of the vessel which had been 
already thro'wn upon the shore. Our ship lay at high 
tide, about a hundred yards from the shore, and in order 
to rescue the crew, a strong rope was tied to the cable, 
which stretched from them to us ; we drew it over to us 
and secured it firmly. This accomplished, two men got 
into the long boat which was loaded with our provisions, &c., 
and on the back of a huge wave, reached the land, but the 



 

boat was dashed upon the shore with so much violeace 
that it broke. With the greatest difficulty we succeeded 
in saving three casks of buiscuit and two of pork. For 
the rest of the crew on board of the vessel, no means of 
safety now remained but the tightly stretched rope, and I 
immediately urged them, by signs, to avail themselves of 
it. The boldest of the sailors threw off his jacket, seized 
the rope, and began his perilous journey ; as soon as he got 
beyond the protection of the wreck, the waves rose, each, 
some yards above his head, and seemed to bury him in 
their depths ; he, however, held on with the gripe of one 
working for his life, and gained a little distance between 
each wave, until one more powerful than the rest, tore the 
rope from him and hurled him upon the shore, where we 
rolled him over and over, until he came to himself. I 
stood up to my chin in the water, although the waves 
broke over my head, and gave all the assistance in my 
power, to the men coming over on the rope, and I was so 
fortunate as to receive the whole crew safe upon the land. 
As we saw that we were upon a desert, barren coast, our 
first, care was to secure the casks of water and provision 
that we had fished out of the breakers ; we then erected 
with our oars and two sails a kind of tent, foolishly purposing that no one would discover us in this inhospitable 
country, and purposing to mend our boats with the wood 
and planks that would be thrown on shore from the wreck, 
so that we might put to sea in a calm, and with the help 
of our compass, reach some European settlement or friendly 
vessel. 



While were diligently occupied in the erection of our 
tent, we perceived a human form emerging from behind a 
sand-hill, and proceed to the shore to plunder our effects, 
which were strewn about there. I approached the stran- 
ger with every sign of peace and amity that I could think 
of; but he seemed very shy, and gave me to understand, 
by signs, that I must keep myself at a distance, while he 
continued to possess himself of our property. I then grew 
angiy, and as he was imarmed, approached until I was 
within twenty paces of him. 

Apparently, he was quite old, but still powerful and 
agile ; the color of his skin was darker than that of a 
North American Indian, and lighter than that of a negro ; 
his clothing consisted of a piece of coarse woollen cloth 
that reached from his breast to his knees. His hair was 
long, matted, and stood out far around his head like a stiff 
brush ; his face resembled more an ourang-outang than a 
human being ; red, fiery eyes, a mouth stretching from ear 
to ear, but filled with sound teeth, and a beard hanging 
down upon his breast from his upper Up and chin, gave him 
a frightful appearance and suggested forcibly to my mind, 
the idea that those teeth had been sharpened in feasts of 
human flesh. Two old women, of a Kke exterior, appa- 
rently his wives, soon joined him. Although they were 
not quite as repulsive as the old man, and wore their long 
hair in braids, yet they were anything but attractive, for 
their brown skin hung in flabby folds from their bodies, 
and their eye-teeth projected like the tusks of the wild 



 

boar. A girl from eighteeu to twenty years old, who was 
just not hideous, and six children of various site and sex, 
entirely naked, completed the group ; they took what they 
wanted, and carried the articles of clothing in-shore, where 
they spread them out to dry. They emptied the beds of 
their contents as they perceived the utility of the outside 
only, and amused themselves with the blowing about of 
the feathers by the wind. 

All appeared perfectly satisfied with their booty, and 
even the forbidding features of the old man brightened a 
little when he encountered no opposition on our part. We 
were, indeed, provided with no fire-arms or other efiective 
weapons, but it would not have been difficult to have 
driven this mob away with some of the poles and planks 
of the wreck. Some of the sailors were preparing to do 
so, but I dissuaded them from it, as I saw clearly that in 
our present wretched condition, the friendship of these 
people was a matter of great importance to us. We qui- 
etly let them take what they wanted and determined to 
defend our provisions only, to the last. 

After spending the day in the erection of our tent, and 
in mending our injured boat, upon which rested all our 
hope of safety, we kindled a great fire and prepared an 
excellent meal of salt meat, not suspecting that this would 
be the last of our provisions that we should enjoy. When 
we had thus refreshed ourselves, we set two of our men as 
a watch, and stretched out our weary limbs upon the soft 
sand. Night had already enveloped every thing in her 
dark mantle, the savages were at a distance, and all was 
 till except the restless waves which broke \apon the for- 



 

gaken wreck and dashed upon some rocks at no great distance firom us. Up to this moment, the exertion which 
our situation rendered necessary, had so occupied my mind 
as to banish all reflection, but now it broke like a flood 
over my soul and the necessary sleep forsook my weary 
frame. The crew relied for safety upon the miserably 
mended boat, but I doubted if we could ever escape from 
the coast through the raging breakers in such a frail skiff. 
On land, danger menaced us from the wild, greedy savages, 
who might be evfea now preparing to rob us, if not of Hfe 
yet of freedom, dragging us away to a slavery worse than 
death. I was distressed and despairing ; a thousand anx 
ieties filled my mind. I was a husband and the father of 
five little children, whom I dearly loved and whom I must 
soon leave orphans. I shuddered, but at last was able to 
say within myself, " Thy ways, great Father of the uni- 
verse, are wisdom and goodness, and who am I ? A grain 
of dust; shall I complain of thy decrees?" 

I soon found consolation in the thought that my companions, who lay around me buried in the deepest slumber, 
were still alive and with me, and I felt it my solemn duty 
to exert all my power for their preservation and safety. 
Occupied with such thoughts, the night passed slowly for 
me ; at last day dawned in the east, not upon a oheering 
prospect of rescue for us, but upon new scenes of misery. 

It was scarcely light when the old man, with his wives 
and children, and two young men whom I had not seen 
the day before, came down to us. He brandished a long 
spear above his head, as if he were about to throw it at us, 
and signified by threatening gestures that we must retreat 



 

to the wreck if we would not fall into the hands  
of his people, whom I already perceived in the distance, 
approaching us with a herd of camels. The women, at the 
same time, raised a fearful shriek, and threw sand into the 
air. When I ran towards the shore, to seize a plank lying 
there, the old man ran like a maniac to our tent, chased 
out of it, with a few pricks of his spear, the men who were 
yet sleeping there, and so terrified them, by his gestures 
and pointing to the drove of camels, that they all rushed 
towards the little boat, whilst I kept the old man at ahttle 
distance with my plank. They prepared to embark in such 
confusion and disorder that the boat filled and sank. Then 
we attempted to escape along the shore, leaving behind us 
all our provision, but the terrible spear was turned against 
us, and we were surrounded by the women, screaming and 
gesticulating like fiends. We now saw that no way of 
escape was left for us ; they were forcing us to embark that 
they might be rid of us without danger to themselves. I 
therefore shoved the long boat into the water, and insisted 
that the crew should get in at the stem one by one ; thus 
we at last succeeded in escaping to the ship, which was by 
this time half full of water. 

III. 

The natives, as soon as we were no longer in the way, 
collected around our tent, and, brandishing their weapons, 
made their camels kneel down — loaded them with our pro- 
visions and other artibles, and then bade their children 
drive them off. The malicious old man cut open our wine 
and water casks, and let the contents escape; the other 



 

articles, for which they could find no use, books, nautical 
instruments, and charts, were heaped up together and 
burned. Now that we had neither food nor water, no 
choice was left us but to put to sea in our leaky boat, to 
remain in the vessel all night and be drowned, or to die in 
the hands of these cruel savages. These, we gathered 
from their gestures, would shortly return with fire-arms; 
besides they could easily reach the wreck, for a sand bar 
extending some distance into the &ea, was even nov,- visible, 
and would be quite dry at low tide. We therefore deter- 
mined to make preparations for our departure as quickly as 
possible; we fished up some pickled beef and bottles of 
wine firom the hold at the risk of our lives. We had no 
water, and our biscuit was all ruiaed. 

We rigged the long boat as well as we could, and were 
about to set sail, when the natives, touched with pity, as 
it seemed, for our wretched condition, approached the 
shore, bowed to the ground, and beckoned to us, with every 
sign of amity, to come again to the land. As we showed 
no inclination to do so, the old man advanced alone into 
the water up to his waist, with a leather bottle of water, 
and invited us repeatedly to come and drink. As we were 
not a little thirsty, I advanced towards him by means of 
the rope which stm stretched from the wreck to the land, 
took the bottle and brought it to my companions. The 
old man then signified to me that he wished to go on board 
of the wreck, if I would stay on shore until his return. 
Convinced that it was best to maintain a friendly under- 
standing with the natives, I accepted his projosition, and 
returned to the beach again. 



 

The young men, women and children, all nearly naked, 
Bat down on the edge of the beach, and repeated the 
friendly signs, looking upwards, as if they called heavtu 
to witness that their intentions were honest. I placed my- 
self in the midst of them and they behaved in a very 
friendly manner, putting their hands into mine, trying on 
my hat, and feeling my clothes, and searching my pocksts 
most thoroughly. 

When the old man had been taken on board by my peo- 
ple, I tried to make them understand that they must keep 
him until I had been set free, hut the roaring of the waves 
prevented me from being understood, and after he had 
examined every thing carefully, from the provisions swim- 
ming about in the hold, to the money, fire-arms, nd what- 
ever else valuable was to be found, he was allowed to 
return. I now attempted to rise ; but two tf the strong- 
est of the young men who were sitting licside me, threw 
themselves upon me like lions, and held me down, while 
the women and children drew their daggers and knives, 
which they had hitherto concealed, and pointed them at 
my breast. Resistance would have availed me nothing, 
I therefore, remained perfectly quiet and determined to 
betray no fear. They now laid aside the hypocritical ex- 
pression of kindness frtjni their faces, and their former 
malignity appeared ; thoy gnashed their teeth and pricked 
my skin with the points of their knives, while the old man 
took up a sabre, seized me by my hair, and made as if he 
would cut off my head. I was satisfied that my last hour 
had come, and that my body was destined to appease the 
hunger of these monsters, whom I firmly believed to be 



 

cannibals. " Grod, thy will be done," I mentally ejacu* 
lated, and resigned myself to m}- inevitable fate. 

But all these threatening gestures were only meant to 
terrify me ; as I showed no signs of fear, the old man 
released my head from his grasp, after he had touched ray 
neck gently with his sabre. Then he made me to under- 
stand that if I valued my life I must immediately have 
all the money that we had on board brought to land. My 
people were about to come to my relief when the old man 
released me, and I shouted to them to bring all the gold 
from the vessel ; they were again prevented by the dis- 
tance and the noise of the waves, from hearing what I 
added, that they must not give it up until I was perfectly 
at liberty. In the hope of effecting my rescue, they col- 
lected all the money that they possessed, amounting to 
about a thousand piastres, and putting it into a bucket, 
slipped it along the rope to the shore. The old man emp- 
tied the bucket into his woollen apron, and commanded me 
to follow him. The two young men led me along by 
my arms, and held their long knives to my breast, while 
the woman and children followed close behind me with 
their spears and daggers. In this way we proceeded about 
seven hundred paces ; then they sat down upon the ground 
and the old man divided the money into three parts, one 
he gave to the young men, and one to his wives, reserving 
the third for himself While they were thus busied, they 
released my arms, and I thought to myself, " If I do not 
now escape my fate is sealed." I felt sure that an unsuo- 
cessfiil attempt at flight would be followed by certain death, 
but I, nevertheless, determined to attempt it, and seized a 



 

moment for it when I thought the attention of all directed 
from me. But one of the young men, observing my in- 
tention, struck a blow at me with his sabre, and although 
I avoided it by falling back upon the ground, it cut through 
my waistcoat ; he was about to repeat the blow, when the 
old man commanded him to desist. 

My tormenters now arose, and still holding me by the 
arms, and threatening me with their knives, continued their 
inland progress. I was in despair, when suddenly the 
thought struck me of appealing to the avarice of these 
savages. I signified to them that the crew possessed much 
more money ; they received this communication with great 
delight, and, sending one of the young men on with their 
booty, they instantly returned with me to the shore, where 
they seated me as before, and commanded me to have the 
promised money brought on shore. Although I knew that 
there was no more money in the vessel, I hoped that my 
men would attempt my rescue, but they now saw clearly 
the danger that threatened them, and were not inclined to 
hazard the venture. I therefore waited an hour on the 
beach, threatened every moment with instant death, and 
finally became so hoarse with hallooing that I could not 
make myself audible to those around me. At last one of 
the sailors, whose humanity conquered his fears for his 
life, came over upon the rope. The natives immediately 
flocked around him, thinking that he had brought more 
money with him; when they discovered their mistake
