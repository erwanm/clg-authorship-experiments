Ruth did not consider it necessary, however, to add 
that she had not notified this aunt of her coming, 
that she did not know whether the aunt still resided 
in Hartford or was underground. These two elderly 
ladies would call her stark mad. Perhaps she was. 
''And you have seen . . . drunken men?" 
Prudence's tones were full of suppressed horror,' 

'' Often. A very small settlement, mostly natives. 
There was a trader —  a man who bought copra and 
pearls. Not a bad map as men go, but he would sell 
whisky and gin. Over here men drink because they 
are lonely; and when they drink too hard and too 
long, they wind up on the beach." 
The spinsters stared at her blankly. 
Ruth went on to explain. "When a man reaches 
the lowest scale through drink, we call him a beach- 
comber. I suppose the phrase —  the word — originally 
meant a man who searched for food on the beach. 
The poor things! Oh, it was quite dreadful. It is 
queer, but men of education and good birth fall 
swiftest and lowest." 

She sent a covert glance toward the young man. 
She alone of them all knew that he was on the first 
leg of the terrible journey to the beach. Somebody 
ought to talk to him, warn him. He was all alone, 
like herself. 

"What are those odd-looking things on the roofs?" 
she asked of Ah Cum. 
"Pigs and fish, to fend oflf the visitations of the 





devil ' Ah Cum smiled. "After all, I believe we 
Chinese have the right idea. The devil is on top, 
not below. We aren't between him and heaven; 
he is between us and heaven." 

The spinsters had no counter-philosophy to offer; 
so they turned to Ruth, who had singularly and un-consciously invested herself with glamour, the 
glamour of adventure, which the old maids did not 
recognize as such because they were only tourists. 
This child at once alarmed and thrilled them. 
She had come across the wicked South Seas 
which were still infested with cannibals; she had 
seen drunkenness and called men beachcombers; 
who was this moment as innocent as a babe, and in 
the next uttered some bitter wisdom it had taken 
a thousand years of philosophy to evolve. And there 
was that dress of hers! She must be warned that 
she had been imposed upon. 

"You'll pardon an old woman. Miss Enschede," 
said Sister Prudence; "but where in this world did 
you get that dress?" 

Ruth picked up both sides of the skirt and spread 
it, looking down. " Is there anything wrong with it? " 

"Wrong? Why, you have been imposed upon 
somewhere. That dress is thirty years old, if a 
day." 

"Oh!" Ruth laughed softly. "That is easily 
explained. I haven't much money; I don't know how 
much it is going to cost me to reach Hartford; so I 



 

fixed over a couple of my mother's dresses. It 
doesn't look bad, does it?" 

"Mercy, no! That wasn't the thought. It was 
that somebody had cheated you." 

The spinster did not ask if the mother lived; the 
question was inconsequent. No mother would have 
sent her daughter into the world with such a ward- 
robe. Straitened circumstances would not have 
jnattered; a mother would have managed somehow. 
In the '80s such a dress would have indicated con- 
siderable financial means; imder the sun-helmet it 
was an anachronism; and yet it served only to add a 
quainter charm to the girl's beauty. 

"Do you know what you make me think of?" 

"What?" 

"As if you had stepped out of some old family 
album." 

The feminine vanities in Ruth were quiescent; 
nothing had ever occurred in her life to tingle them 
into action. She was dressed as a white woman 
should be; and that for the present satisfied her 
instincts. But she threw a verbal bombshell into the 
spinsters' camp. 

"What is a family album?" 

"You poor child, do you mean to tell me you've 
never seen a family album? Why, it's a book filled 
with the photographs of your grandmothers and 
grandfathers, your aunts and uncles and cousins, 
your mother and father when they were little." 





Ruth stood with drawn brows; she was trying to 
recall. "No; we never had one; at least, I never 
saw it." 

The lack of a family album for some reason put a 
little ache in her heart. Grandmothers and grand- 
fathers and uncles and aunts       to love and to 
coddle lonely little girls. 

"You poor child!" said Prudence. 

" Then I am old-fashioned. Is that it? I thought 
this very pretty." 

"So it is, child. But one changes the style of 
one's clothes yearly. Of course, this does not apply 
to uninteresting old maids," Prudence modified 
with a dry little smile. 

"But this is good enough to travel in, isn't it?" 

"To be sure it is. When you reach San Francisco, 
you can buy something more appropriate." It 
occurred to the spinster to ask: "Have you ever seen 
a fashion magazine?" 

"No. Sometimes we had the ilustrated London 
News and Tit-Bits. Sailors would leave them at 
the trader's." 

"AKce in Wonderland!" cried Prudence, perhaps 
a little enviously. 

"Oh, I've read that!" 

Spurlock had heard distinctly enough all of this 
odd conversation; but until the spinster's reference 
to the family album, no phrase had been sufficient 
in strength of attraction to break the trend of his own 



 

unhappy thoughts. Out of an old family album: 
here was the very comparison that had eluded him. 
His hterary instincts began to stir. A South Sea 
island giri, and this was her first adventure into 
civilization. Here was the comer-stone of a capital 
story; but he knew that Howard Spurlock would 
never write it. 

Other phrases returned now, like echoes. The 
beachcomber, the lowest in the human scale; and 
some day he would enter into this estate. Between 
him and the beach stood the sum of six hundred 
dollars. 

But one thing troubled him, and because of it he 
might never arrive on the beach. A new inexplicable 
madness that urged him to shrill ironically the story 
of his coat —  to take it off and fling it at the feet of 
any stranger who chanced to be nigh. 

"Look at it!" he felt like screaming. "Clean and 
spotless, but beginning to show the wear and tear of 
constant use. I have worn it for weeks and weeks. 
I have slept with it under vay pillow. Observe it — 
a blue-serge coat. Ever hear of the djinn in the 
bottle? Like enough. But did you ever hear of a 
djinn in a blue-serge coat? Stitched in!" 

Something like this was always rushing into his 
throat; and he had to sink his nails into his palms to 
stop his mouth. Very fascinating, though, trying to 
analyse the impulse. It was not an affair of the 
conscience; it was vaguely based upon insolence and 





defiance. He wondered if these abnormal mental 
activities presaged illness. To be ill and helpless; 

He went on munching his water-chestnuts, and 
stared at the skyline. He hated horizons. He was 
always visuaKzing the Hand whenever he let his 
gaze rest upon the horizon. An enormous Hand 
that rose up swiftly, blotting out the sky. A Hand 
that strove to reach his shoulder, relentless, soulless 
but lawful. The scrutiny of any strange man pro- 
voked a sweaty terror. What a God-forsaken fool he 
was ! And dinJy , out there somewhere in the South 
Seas — the beach ! 

Already he sensed the fascination of the inevitable; 
and with this fascination came the idea of haste, to 
get there quickly and have done. Odd, but he had 
never thought of the beach until this girl (who looked 
as if she had stepped out of the family album) re- 
ferred to it with a familiarity which was as astonish- 
ing as it was profoundly sad. 

The beach : to get there as quickly as he could, to 
reach the white man's nadir of abasement and 
gather the promise of that soothing indiflFerence which 
comes with the final disintegration of the fibres of 
conscience. He had an objective now. 




CHAPTER IV 

(HE tourists returned to the Sha-mien at four 
o'clock. They were silent and no longer 
observant, being more or less exhaused by the 
tedious action of the chairs. Even Ah Cum had 
resumed his Oriental shell of reserve. To reach the 
Sha-mien —  and particularly the Hotel Victoria — one 
crossed a narrow canal, always choked with rocking 
sampans over and about which swarmed yellow men 
and women and children in varied shades of faded 
blue cotton. At simset the swarming abruptly 
ceased; even the sampans appeared to draw closer 
together, with the quiet of water-fowl. There is 
everywhere at night in China the original fear of 
darkness. 

From the portals of the hotel — scarcely fifty yards 
from the canal — one saw the blank face of the 
ancient city of Canton. Blank it was, except for a 
gate near the bridgehead. Into this hole in the wall 
and out of it the native stream flowed from sunrise 
to sunset, when the stream mysteriously ceased. 
The silence of Canton at night was sinister, for none 
could prophesy what form of mob might suddenly 
boil out. 
No Cantonese was in those days permitted to 


cross to the Sha-mien after sunset without a license. 
To simplify matters, he carried a coloured paper 
lantern upon which his license number was painted in 
Arabic numerals. It added to the picturesqueness 
of the Sha-mien night to observe these gaily coloured 
lanterns dancing hither and yon like June fireflies in a 
meadow. 

Meantime the spinsters sought the dining room 
where tea was being served. They had much to talk 
about, or rather Miss Prudence had. 

"But she is a dear," said Angelina, timidly. 

"I'll admit that. But I don't understand her; 
she's over my head. She leaves me almost without 
comparisons. She is like some character out of Phra 
the Phoenician: she's been buried for thirty years and 
just been excavated. That's the way she strikes me. 
And it's imcanny." 

"But I never saw anybody more alive." 

"Who wouldn't be Kvely after thirty years' sleep? 
Did you hear her explain about beachcombers? And 
yet she looks at one with the straightest glance I 
ever saw. StiD, I'm glad she didn't accept my in- 
vitation to join us. I shouldn't care to have 
attention constantly drawn to us. This world over 
here! Everything's upside-down or back-end-to. 
Humph!" 

"What's the matter?" 

"Sh!" 

Spurlock passed by on the way to the bar. Ap- 



 

parently he did not see his recent companions. 
There was a strained, eager expression on his face. 

"Going to befuddle himself between now and 
dinner," was the comment of Prudence. 

"The poor young man!" sighed Angelina. 

"Pah! He's a fool. I never saw a man who 
wasn't." 

" There was Father," suggested Angelina gently. 

"Ninny! What did we know about Father, except 
when he was around the house? But where is the 
girl? She said something about having tea with us. 
I want to know more about her. I wonder if she has 
any idea how oddly beautiful she is?" 

Ruth at that precise moment was engaged by a 
relative wonder. She was posing before the mirror, 
critically, miserably, defensively, and perhaps be- 
wilderedly. What was the matter with the dress? 
She could not see. For the past four weeks mirrors 
had been her delight, a new toy. Here was one that 
subtly mocked her. 

Life is a patchwork of impressions, of vanishing 
personalities. Each human contact leaves some 
indelible mark. The spinsters — who on the morrow 
would vanish out of the girl's life for ever —  had 
already left their imprint upon her imagination. 
Clothes. Henceforth Ruth would closely observe 
her fellow women and note the hang of their skirts. 

Around her neck was a little gold chain. She 
gathered up the chain, revealing a locket which had 





lain hidden in her bosom. The locket contained the 
face of her mother — all the family album she had. 
She studied the face and tried to visualize the body, 
clothed in the dress which had created the spinsters' 
astonishment. Very well. To-morrow, when she 
returned to Hong-Kong, she would purchase a simple 
but modem dress. Anything that drew attention to 
her must be avoided. 

She dropped the locket into its sweet hiding place. 
It was precious for two reasons: it was the photo- 
graph of her beautiful mother whom she could not 
remember, and it would identify her to the aunt in 
Hartford. 

She uttered a little ejaculative note of joy and 
rushed to the bed. A dozen books lay upon the 
counterpane. Oh, the beautiful books! Romance, 
adventure, love stories! She gathered up the books 
in her arms and cuddled them, as a mother might 
have cuddled a child. Love stories! It was of 
negligible importance that these books were bound 
in paper; Romance lay unalterably within. All these 
wonderful comrades, henceforth and for ever hers. 
She would never again be lonely. Les Miserables, 
A Tale of Two Cities, Henry Esmond, The Last 
Days of Pompeii, ' The Marble Faun . . . Love 
stories ! 

Until her arrival in Singapore, she had never read 
a novel. Pilgrim's Progress, The Life of Martin 
Luther and Alice in Wonderland (the only fairy-story 



 

slie had been pennitted to read) were the sum total 
of her library. But in the appendix of the dictionary 
she had discovered magic names —  Hugo, Dumas, 
Thackeray, Hawthorne, Lytton. She had also discovered the names of Grimm and Andersen; but at 
that time she had not been able to visualize "the 
pale slender things with gossamer wings'' —  fairies. 
The world into which she was so boldly venturing 
was going to be wonderful, but never so wonderful 
as the world within these paper covers. Already 
Cosette was her chosen friend. Daily contact with 
actual human beings all the more inclined her toward 
the imaginative. 

Joyous, she felt the need of physical expression; 
and her body began to sway sinuously, to glide and 
turn and twist about the room. As she danced there 
was in her ears the faded echo of wooden tom-toms. 
Eventually her movements carried her to the little 
stand at the side of the bed. There lay upon this 
stand a book bound in limp black leather —  the Holy 
Bible. 

Her glance, absorbing the gilt letters and their 
significance, communicated to her poised body a 
species of paralysis. She stood without motion and 
without strength. The books slid from her arms 
and fluttered to the floor. Presently repellance grew 
under the frozen mask of astonishment and dissipated 
it. 
"No!'' she cried. "No, no!" 





With a gesture, fierce and intolerant, she seized 
the Bible and thrust it out of sight, into the drawer. 
Then, her body still tense with the atoms of anger, 
she sat down upon the edge of the bed and rocked 
from side to side. But shortly this movement 
ceased. The recollection of the forlorn and loveless 
years — stirred into consciousness by the unexpected 
confrontation —  bent her as the high wind bends the 
water-reed. 

"My father!" she whispered. "My own father!" 

Queerly the room and its objects receded and 
vanished; and there intervened a series of mental 
pictures that so long as she Kved would ever be 
recurring. She saw the moonlit waters, the black 
shadow of the proa, the moon-fire that ran down the 
far edge of the bellying sail, the silent natives: no 
sound except the slapping of the outrigger and the 
low sibilant murmur of water falling away from the 
sides —  and the beating of her heart. The fight. 

How she had fought her eagerness in the beginning, 
lest it reveal her ignorance of the marvels of man- 
kind! The terror and ecstasy of that night in 
Singapore —  the first city she had ever seen! There 
was still the impression that something akin to a 
miracle had piloted her successfully from one ordeal 
to another. 

The clerk at the Raffles Hotel had accorded her but 
scant interest. She had, it was true, accepted 
doubtfully the pen he had offered. She had not 



 

been suflSciently prompted in relation to the ways of 
caravansaries; but her mind had been alert and 
receptive. Ahnost at once she had comprehended 
that she was expected to write down her name and 
address, which she did, in slanting cobwebby lettering, perhaps a trifle laboriously. Ruth Enschede, 
Hartford, Conn. The address was of course her 
destination, thousands of miles away, an infinitesimal 
spot in a terrifying space. 

She could visualize the picture she had presented, 
particularly the battered papier-match kitbag at her 
feet. In Europe or in America people would have 
smiled; but in Singapore — the half-way port of the 
world — where a human kaleidoscope tumbles con- 
tinuously east and west, no one had remarked her. 
She would never forget the agony of that first 
meal in the great dining room. She could have 
dined iilone in her room; but courage had demanded 
that she face the ordeal and have done with it. 
Every eye seemed focussed upon her; and yet she had 
known the sensation to be the conceit of her imagination. 

The beautiful gowns and the flashing bare shoulders and arms of the women had disturbed and dis- 
tressed her. Women, she had been taught, who 
exposed the flesh of their bodies under the eyes of 
man were in a special catagory of the damned. 
Almost instantly she had recognized the fallacy of 
such a statement. These women could not be bad. 





else the hotel would not have permitted them to 
enter! Still, the scene presented a riddle: to give 
immunity to the black women who went about all but 
naked and to damn the white for exposing their 
shoulders! 

She had eaten but little; all her hunger had been in 
her eyes —  and in her heart. Loneliness —  something 
that was almost physical: as if the vitaKty had been 
taken out of the air she breathed. The longing to 
talk to someone! But in the end she had gone to 
her room without giving in to the craving. 

Once in the room, the door locked, the sense of 
loneliness had dropped away from her as the mists 
used to drop away from the mountain in the morning. 
Even then she had understood vaguely that she had 
touched upon some philosophy of life: that one was 
never lonely when alone, only in the midst of crowds. 

Another picture slid across her vision. She saw 
herself begin a slow, sinuous dance: and stop suddenly in the middle of a figure, conscious that the 
dance was not impromptu, her own, but native — 
the same dance she had quitted but a few minutes 
gone. She had fallen into it naturally, the only 
expression of the dance she had ever seen or known, 
and that a stolen sweet. That was odd : when young 
people were joyous, they had to express it physically. 
But native ! She must watch out. 

She remembered that she had not gone to bed 
until two o'clock in the morning. She had carried a 




 

chair into the room veranda and had watched and 
listened until the night silences had lengthened and 
only occasionally she heard a voice or the rattle of 
rickshaw wheels in the courtyard. 

The great ordeal —  that which she had most 
dreaded —  had proved to be no ordeal at all. The 
kindly American consul-general had himself taken 
her to the bank, where her banknotes had been ex- 
changed for a letter of credit, and had thoroughly 
advised her. Everything had so far come to pass as 
the withered old Kanaka woman had foretold. 

"The Golden One knows that I have seen the 

world; therefore follow my instructions. Never 

glance sideways at man. Nothing else matters." 

The prison bars of circumstance, they no longer 

encompassed her. Her wings were oddly weak, but 

for all that she could fly. That was the glorious if 

bewildering truth. She had left for ever the cage, 

the galling leash : she was free. The misty caravans 

of which she had dreamed were become actualities. 

She had but to choose. All about her, hither and 

yon, lay the enticing Unknown. Romance! The 

romance of passing faces, of wires that carried voices 

and words to the far ends of the world, of tremendous 

mechanisms that propelled ships and trains! And, 

oh the beautiful books ! 

She swiftly knelt upon the floor and once more 
gathered the books to her heart. 



CHAPTER V 

AT DINNER the spinsters invited Ruth to sit 
at their table, an invitation she accepted 
JLL gratefully. She was not afraid exauctly, but 
there was that about her loneliness to-night she distrusted. Detached, it was not impossible that she 
would be forced to leave the dining room because of 
invading tears. To be near someone, even someone 
who made a pretense of friendliness, to hear voices, 
her own intermingling, would serve as a rehabilitating tonic. The world had grown dark and wide, and 
she was very small. Doubts began to rise up all 
about her, plucking at her confidence. Could she 
go through with it? She must. She would never, 
never go back. 

As usual the substantive sister —  Prudence — did all 
the talking for the pair; Angelina, the shadow, 
offered only her submitting nods. Sometimes she 
missed her cue and nodded aflSrmatively when the 
gesture should have been the reverse; and Prudence 
would send her a sharp glance of disapproval. 
Angelina's distress over these mischances was 
pathetic. 

None of this by-play escaped Ruth, whose sense of 
humour needed no developing. That she possessed
