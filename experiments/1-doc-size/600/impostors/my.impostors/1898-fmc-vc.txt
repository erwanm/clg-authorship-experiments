" A little accent, my friend I If you only had a 
little accent ! " 

His wiry figure disappeared through the door a 
moment later, and Gilbert was alone. He asked 
himself whether the Queen had meant to insult him, 
and he could not believe it. But presently, as he 
remembered all that had happened, it occurred to 
him that she might be ashamed of having shown him 
her heart in a moment of great danger, and now, as 
if to cover herself, she meant him to understand that 
he was nothing to her but a brave man who ought to 
be substantially and richly rewarded for having risked 
his life on her behalf. 

Strangely enough, the thought pleased him now, 
as much as the brutal offer of the gold had outraged 
his honourable feeling. It was far better, he reflected, 
that the Queen should act thus and help him to look 
upon her as a being altogether beyond his sphere, as 
she really was. After this, he thought, it would be 
impossible and out of the question that any look or 
touch of hers could send a thrill through him, like 
little rivers of fire, from his head to his heels. The 



 

hand that had been held out to pay him money for 
its own life, must be as cold as a stone and as 
unfeeling. She was helping him to be true. 

He shook himself and stretched his long arms as 
if awaking from sleep and dreaming. The motion 
hurt him, and he felt all his bruises at once, but there 
was a sort of pleasure in the pain, that accorded with 
his strange state of heart, and he did it a second 
time in order to feel the pain once more. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

The knight, whose name was Gaston de Castignac, 
faithfully fulfilled Gilbert's wishes, using certain 
ornate flourishes of language which the Englishman 
could certainly not have invented, and altogether 
expressing an absolute refusal in the most compliment- 
ary manner imaginable. The Queen bade him return 
the gold to her seneschal without breaking the leaden 
seal that pinched the ends of the knotted strings 
together. When she was alone, her women being 
together in the outer part of the tent, she hid her 
face in her white hands, as she sat, and bending for- 
ward, she remained in that attitude a long time, 
without moving. 

It was as Gilbert had thought. In the generous 
impulse that had prompted her to ask Beatrix's for- 
giveness she had done what was hardest for her to do, 
in a sort of wild hope that, by insulting the man who 
had such strong attraction for her, she might send him 
away out of her sight forever. Had he accepted the 
money, she would assuredly have despised him, and 
contempt must kill all thoughts of love ; but since he 
refused it, he must be angry with her, and he would 
either leave her army, and join himself to the Ger- 
mans during the rest of the campaign, or, at the very 
least, he would avoid her. 

But now that it was done and he had sent back the 




 

money in scorn, as she clearly understood in spite of 
her knight's flowery speeches, she felt the shame of 
having treated a poor gentleman like a poor servant, 
and then the certainty that he must believe her un- 
grateful began to torment her, so that she thought of 
his face, and longed to see him with all her heart. 
For Beatrix's sake and her own honour she would 
not send for him ; but she called one of her women 
and sent for the Lady Anne of Auch, who bore 
the standard of the ladies' troop, the same who had 
stopped her horse without a fall. In her the Queen 
had great faith for her wisdom, for she had a man's 
thoughts with a woman's heart. 

She came presently, tall and grave as a stately 
cypress among silver birches and shimmering white 
poplar trees. 

" I have sent for you to ask you a question," the 
Queen began, " or, perhaps, to ask your advice." 

The Lady Anne bowed her head, and when 
Eleanor pointed to a folding-stool beside her, she sat 
down and waited, fixing her black eyes on a distant 
part of the tent. 

" You saw that young Englishman who stopped my 
horse," the Queen began. " I wish to reward him. 
I have sent him five hundred pieces of gold, and he 
has refused to receive the gift." 

The black eyes turned steadily to the Queen's face, 
gazed at her for a moment, and then looked away 
again, while not a feature moved. There was silence, 
for Anne of Auch said nothing while Eleanor waited. 

"What shall I do now?" Eleanor asked after a 
long pause. 





" Madam," answered the dark lady, smiling thought- 
fully, " I think that, since you have offered him gold 
first, he would refuse a kingdom if you should press 
it upon him now, for he is a brave man." 

" Do you know him ? " asked Eleanor, almost 
sharply, and her eyes hardened. 

" I have seen him many times, but I have never 
spoken with him. We talk of him now and then, 
because he is unlike the other knights, mixing little 
with them in the camp and riding often alone on 
the march. They say he is very poor, and he is 
surely brave." 

" What does Beatrix de Curboil say of him ? " The 
Queen's voice was still sharp. 

" Beatrix ? She is my friend, poor girl. I never 
heard her speak of this gentleman." 

" She is very silent, is she not ? " 

" Oh, no ! She is sometimes sad, and she has told me 
how her father took a second wife who was unkind 
to her, and she speaks of her own childhood as if she 
were the daughter of a great house. But that is all." 

" And she never told you her stepmother's name, 
and never mentioned this Englishman ? " 

"Never, Madam, I am quite sure. But she is 
often very gay and quick of wit, and makes us laugh, 
even when we are tired and hot after a day's march 
and are waiting for our women ; and sometimes she 
sings strange old Norman songs of Duke William's 
day, very sweetly, and little Saxon slave songs which 
we cannot understand." 

" I have never heard her laugh nor sing, I think," 
said Eleanor, thoughtfully. 



 

"She is very grave before your Grace. I have 
noticed it. That may be the English manner." 

"I think it is." The Queen thought of Gilbert, 
and wondered whether he were ever gay. " But the 
question," she continued, "is what am I to do for 
the man?" 

She spoke coldly and indifferently, but her eyes 
were watching the Lady Anne's face. 

"What should you do yourself?" she asked, as 
the noble woman made no answer. 

"I should not have sent him gold first," replied 
Anne of Auch. " But since that cannot be undone, 
your Grace can only offer him some high honour, 
which may be an honour only, and not wealth." 

" He is not even a knight ! " 

"Then give him knighthood and honour too. 
Your Grace has made knights, — there is Gaston de 
Castignac, — and the fashion of receiving knighthood 
from the Church only, is past." 

" I have heard him say that he would have it from 
his own liege sovereign, or not at all. He wHl not 
even set a device in his shield, as many are begin- 
ning to do, to show in the field that they are of good 
stock." 

"Give him one, then — a device that shall be a 
perpetual honour to his house and a memory of a 
brave deed well done for a Queen's sake." 

" And then ? Shall that be all ? " 

" And then, if he be the man he seems, single him 
out for some great thing, and bid him risk his life 
again in doing it for the Holy Cross, and for your 
Grace's sake." 





" That is good. Your counsel was always good. 
What thing shall I give him to attempt ? " 

" Madam, the Germans have been betrayed by 
the Greek Emperor's Greek guides, and we our- 
selves have no others, so that we in turn shall be led 
to slaughter if we follow them. If it please your 
Grace, let this Englishman choose such men as he 
trusts, and go ever before our march, till we reach 
Syria, sending tidings back to us, and receiving 
them, and bearing the brunt of danger for us." 

" That would be indeed an honourable part," said 
the Queen, thoughtfully, and she turned slowly pale, 
careless of her lady's straight gaze. " He can never 
live to the end of it," she added, iu a low voice. 

" It is better to die for the Cross than to die or 
live for any woman's love," said Anne of Auch, and 
there was the music of faith in her soft tones. 

The Queen glanced at her, wondering how much 
she guessed, and suddenly conscious that she herself 
had changed colour. 

"And what device shall I set in this man's 
shield?" she asked, going back to the beginning, in 
order to avoid what touched her too closely. 

"A cross," answered Anne. "Let me see — why 
not your Grace's ovra ? The Cross of Aquitaine ? " 

But the Queen did not hear, for she was dream- 
ing, and she saw Gilbert, in her thoughts, riding to 
sure death with a handful of brave men, riding into 
an ambush of the terrible Seljuks, pierced by their 
arrows — one in his white throat as he reeled back 
in the saddle, his eyes breaking in death. She 
shuddered, and then started as if waking. 



 

" "What did you say ? " she asked. " I was think- 
ing of something else." 

'.' I said that your Grace might give him the Cross 
of Aquitaine for a device," answered the Lady of 
Auch. 

Her quiet black eyes watched the Queen, not in 
suspicion, but with a sort of deep and womanly 
sympathy; for she herself had loved well, and on 
the eighth day after she had wedded her husband, 
he had gone out with others against the Moors in 
the southern mountains; and they had brought him 
home on his shield, wrapped in salted hides, and 
she had seen his face. Therefore she had taken 
the Cross, not as many ladies had taken it, in light- 
ness of heart, but earnestly, seeking a fair death on 
the field of honour for the hope of the life to come. 

" Yes," said the Queen, " he shall have the Cross of 
Aquitaine. Fetch me some gentleman or squire skilled 
with colours, and send for the Englishman's shield." 

" Madam," said Anne of Auch, " I myself can use 
a brush, and by your leave I will paint the device 
under your eyes." 

It was no uncommon thing in that day for a lady 
of France to understand such arts better than men, 
and Eleanor was glad, and ordered that the shield 
should be brought quickly, by two of the elder pages 
who were soon to be squires. 

But Alric, the groom, who lay in the shade out- 
side Gilbert's tent, chewing blades of grass and wish- 
ing himself in England, would not let the messengers 
take the shield from the lance without authority, and 
he called Dunstan, who went and asked Gilbert what 





he should do. So Gilbert came and stood in the door 
of his tent, and spoke to the young men. 

" We know nothing, sir, save that we are bidden 
to bring your shield to the Queen." 

" Take it. And you shall tell her Grace from me 
that I crave excuse if the shield be of an old fashion, 
with rounded shoulders, for it was my father's ; and 
you shall say also that she has power to take it, but 
that I will not sell it, nor take anything in return 
for it." 

The two young men looked at him strangely, as if 
doubting whether he were in his right mind. But 
as they went away together, the one who bore the 
shield said to the other that they should not give 
the message, for it was discourteous and might do 
harm to themselves. But the other was for telling 
the truth, since they could call Gilbert's men to 
witness of the words. 

" And if we are caught in a lie," he said, " we 
shall be well beaten." 

For they were young and were pages, not yet 
squires, and still under education. 

"Also we shall be beaten if we say things un- 
courtly to the Queen," retorted the first. 

" This air smells of sticks," said the other, as he 
sniffed, and laughed at his jest, but somewhat ner- 
vously. 

" You shall speak for us," concluded his companion, 
" for you are the truth-teller." 

So they came to the Queen, and laid the blank 
shield at her feet, and neither would say anything. 

" Saw you the gentleman to whom it belongs ? " 
she asked. 



 

" Yes, Madam " they answered in one breath. 
" And said he anything ? Have you no message ? " 
"He said, Madam — " said one, and stopped short. 
"Yes, Madam, he said that we should tell your 
Grace—" 

But the page's courage failed him, and he stopped 
also. 

" What said he ? " asked Eleanor, bending her 
brows. " Speak out ! " 

"May it please your Grace, the gentleman said 
that it was his father's shield." 

"And that he craved excuse if it were of an^old 
fashion," added the other. 

" And that he would not sell it," concluded the 
one who was the bolder of the two. 

Then he shrank back, and his companion too, and 
they seemed trying to get behind each other ; for the 
Queen's eyes flashed wrath, and her beautiful lips 
parted a little over her gleaming teeth, that were 
tightly closed. But in aii instant she was calm again, 
and she took money from her wallet and gave each 
page a piece of gold, and spoke quietly. 

" You are brave boys to give me such a message," 
she said. " But if I chance to find out that you have 
changed it on the way, you shall each have as many 
blows as there are French deniers in a Greek bezant 
— and I doubt whether any one knows how many 
there may be." 

"We speak truth. Madam," said the two, in a 
breath, "and we humbly thank your Grace." 

She sent them away, and sat looking at the shield 
at her feet, while Anne of Auch waited in silence. 





Eleanor's eyes burned in her head, and her hands were 
cold, and would have shaken a little if she had not 
held them tightly clasped together. 

" It was unknightly of him to say that," she cried 
at last, as if it hurt her. 

But her lady was still silent, and the Queen turned 
her hot eyes to her. 

"You say nothing. Was it not unknightly of 
him ? " 

"Madam," answered Anne of Auch, "since you 
wished to pay him for your life, it is little wonder 
if he thinks you may offer to buy his arms." 

They said no more for a long time, and from the 
outer tent the sweet subdued voices of many women, 
talking and laughing softly together, floated into the 
silence like the song of birds at dawn. At last the 
Queen spoke, but it was to herself. 

" He had the right," she said bitterly, and bent 
her head a little, and sighed. " Paint me the shield, 
Lady Anne," she added, a moment later, looking up 
calmly once more. " On a field azure, for the 
faith he keeps, gild him the cross flory of Aquitaine 
— for me ! " 

She rose and began to walk slowly up and down 
the tent, glancing at Anne from time to time. The 
lady had sent for her colours, ground on a piece of 
white marble, and a small chafing-dish with burning 
coals, in which a little copper pot of melted wax mixed 
with resin stood on an iron tripod. She warmed her 
brush in the wax, and took up the costly blue on it, 
and spread it very dexterously over all the long shield. 
When it was cool, the resin made it very hard, and 



 

with, rule and dividers she measured out the cross 
with its equal arras, all flowered, and drew it skil- 
fully, while the Queen watched her deft fingers. 
And last of all she moistened the cross with Arabian 
gum, a little at a time, and laid strong gold-leaf upon 
it with a sharp steel instrument, blowing hard upon 
each leaf as soon as it was laid, to press it down, and 
smoothing it with a hare's-foot. When it was all 
covered and dry, she took a piece of soft leather 
wrapped about her forefinger, and carefully went 
round the outline, taking off the superfluous leaf 
that spread beyond the gummed part. She had 
learned these things from an Italian who had come 
to Auch to adorn the chapel of her father's house. 

The Queen had sat down long before it was finished, 
but her eyes followed the Lady Anne's brush and her 
fingers, while neither of the women spoke. 

"It is a fair shield," said Eleanor, when it was 
done. " Lady Anne, shall I send it to him, or shall 
he come here ? Were you in my place, which should 
you do ? " 

"Madam, I would send for the Englishman. 
From your Grace's hands he cannot refuse honour." 

Eleanor did not answer, but after a moment she 
rose and turned away. 

" Nor death," she said in a low voice, as to herself, 
and stood still, and pressed her hand to her fore- 
head. " Send for him, and leave me alone till he 
comes, but stay when he is here," she added, in clear 
tones ; and still not looking at the Lady Anne, she 
bent her head and went out. 

The tall, old-fashioned shield stood on its point, 





leaning against the table. Eleanor looked at it, and 
her features were moved, now that she was alone 
and her eyes were veiled. She lifted it in both her 
hands, wondering at its weight, and she pushed aside 
an inner curtain and set the shield upon an altar that 
was there, hidden from the rest of the tent for 
a little oratory, as in many royal chambers. Then 
she knelt down at the kneeling-stool and folded her 
hands. 

She was not ungenerous, she was not at heart 
unjust; she deserved some gentleness of judgment, 
for she was doing her best to fight her love, for her 
royal honour's sake and for the sick girl who seemed 
so poor a rival, but who loved Gilbert "Warde as well 
as she and less selfishly. As she knelt there, she 
believed that she was in the great struggle of her 
life, and that at once and forever she could make 
the sacrifice, though it had grown to be a great one. 

She meant to send him before the army, and the 
wager for his death was as a hundred to one. Let 
him die — that was the consecration of the sacrifice. 
Dead in glory, dead for Christ's sake, dead in the 
spotless purity of his young knighthood, she could 
love him fearlessly thereafter, and speak very gentle 
words upon his grave. It was not cruel to send him 
to die thus, if his days were numbered, and he him- 
self would gratefully thank her for preferring him 
before others to lead the van of peril ; for the way 
of the Cross leads heavenwards. But if he should 
come alive through the storm of swords, he must win 
great honour for all his life. 

Thereupon she prayed for him alone, and she 



dedicated his great shield on her own altar, in her own 
words, with all her passionate heart, wherein beat 
the blood of her grandsire, dead in a hermit's cell 
after much love and war, and the blood of the son 
she was to bear long after, whom men were to call 
the Lion-Hearted. 

And she prayed thus, with a pale face : — 
" Almighty God, most just, who art the truth, and 
who orderest good against evil, with pain, that men 
may be saved by overcoming, help me to give up 
what is most dear in my life. Hear me, O God, a 
sinful woman, and have mercy upon me ! Hear me, 

God, and though I perish, let this man's soul be 
saved ! 

" Lord Jesus Christ, most pitiful and kind, to Thee 

I bring my sin, and I steadfastly purpose to be faith- 
ful, and to renounce and abhor my evil desires and 
thoughts. Hear me, O Christ, a sinful woman I 
To Thy service and to the honour of Thy most 
sacred Cross, I dedicate this true man. Bless Thou 
this shield of his, that it may be between him and 
his enemies, and his arms, also, that he may go before 
our host, and save many, and lead us to Thy holy 
place in Jerusalem ! Endue him with grace, fill him 
with strength, enlighten his heart. Hear me and 
help me, O Christ, a sinful, loving woman ! 

" Holy Spirit of God, Most High, Creator, Com- 
forter, let Thy pure gifts descend upon this clean- 
hearted man, that his courage fail not in life, nor 
in the hour of death. Hear me, a sinful woman. 
Thou who, with the Father and the Son, livest and 
reignest in glory forever ! " 





When she had prayed, she knelt a little while 
longer, with bowed head pressing against her 
clasped hands on the praying-stool till they hurt 
her. And that was the hardest, for it had been 
her meaning to make a solemn promise, and she 
saw between her and her love the barrier of her 
faith to be kept to God, and of her respect of her 
own plighted honour. 

Rising at last, she took the shield again, and 
kissed it once between the arms of the cross ; and 
her lips made a small mark on the fresh gold- 
leaf, 

" He will never know what it is," she said to 
herself, as she looked at the place, " but I think that 
no arrow shall strike through it there, nor any 
lance." 

Suddenly she longed to kiss the shield again, and 
many times, to thousands, as if her lips could give it 
tenfold virtue to defend. But she thought of her 
prayer and would not, and she brought the shield 
back into the tent, out of the oratory, and set it 
upright against the table. 

Then, after a time, Anne of Auch lifted the 
curtain to let Gilbert in, standing by the entrance 
when he had passed her. 

He bent his head courteously but not humbly, 
and then stood upright, pale from what he had 
suffered, his eyes fixed as if he were making 
an inward effort. The Queen spoke, coldly and 
clearly. 

" Gilbert Warde, you saved my life, and you have 
sent back a gift from me. I have called you to
