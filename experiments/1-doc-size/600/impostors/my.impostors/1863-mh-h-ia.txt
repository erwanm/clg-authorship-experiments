frames, and Grecian painting, and all such vanities ?" 

" If I must speak the truth, I do most heartily!" 

Victoria was not easily turned from her purpose. 

"Come, Sarah ! Tell us what you would have us, poor 
trifling, silly things, do to kill the time." 

" If you must be a murderer, do it in your own way. I 
have nothing to say in the matter." 

" Do you mean that time never hangs upon your hands ? 
that you are never ennuyee blasee?" 

" Speak English, and I will answer you !" 

" I want to know," said the persevering tormentor, " if 
the hum-drum books up-stairs, your paint box, and your 
easel are such good company that you are contented and 
happy always when you are with them ? if you never get 
cross with yourself and everybody else, and wonder what 
you were put into the world for, and why the world itself 
was made, and wish that you could sleep until doomsday. 
Do you ever feel like this ?" 

Sarah lifted her eyes with a wondering, incredulous stare 
at the flippant inquisitor. 

" I have felt thus, but I did not suppose that you had !" 

" Oh ! I have a blue turn now and then, but the disease 
is always more dangerous with girls of your sort the reading, thinking, strong-minded kind. And the older you 
grow, the worse you will get. I haven't as much book 
knowledge as you have, but I know more of the world we 
we live in. Take my advice and settle down to woman's 
right sphere. Drive away the vapors with beaux and fancy- 
work now. By and by, a husband and an establishment 
will give you something else to think about." 

Sarah would have replied, but Lucy broke in with a 
laugh, light and sweet. 

"You two are always at cross-questions! Why can't 
you be satisfied to let one another alone? Sarah and I 
never quarrel, Vie. We agree to disagree. She gives me 
my way and I don't meddle with her. If she likes the 
blues (they say some people enjoy them), where's the harm 
of her having them ? They never come near me. If I get 
stupid, I go to bed and sleep it off. Don't you think I have 
done ten rows, since breakfast ? What a godsend a rainy 
day is, when one has a fascinating piece of work on hand !" 
* Too proud to seem to abandon the field, Sarah sat for 
half an hour longer, stitching steadily away at the complicated tracery upon the ground to be worked ; then, as the 
dimmer daylight caused the others to draw near to the 
windows, she pushed aside her table and put by her sewing. 

" Don't let us drive you away !" said Victoria's mock- 
polite tones ; and Lucy added, kindly, " We do not mean 
to disturb you, Sarah, dear !" 

" You do not disturb me !" was the reply to the latter. 
The other had neither glance nor word. 

Up another flight she mounted to a room, much smalher 
than that she had left and far plainer in its appointments. 
The higher one went in Mrs. Hunt's house, the less splendid 
every thing became. In the state spare chamber a story 
below nothing of comfort and luxury was wanting, from 



 

the carved rose-wood bedstead, with the regal-looking 
canopy overshadowing its pillows, down to the Bohemian 
and cut-glass scent bottles upon the marble of the dressing- 
cabinet. Sarah's carpet was common ingrain, neither pretty 
nor new ; a cottage bedstead of painted wood ; bureau and 
wash-stand of the same material ; two chairs, and a small 
table were all the furniture her mother adjudged needful. 
To these the girl had added, from her pittance of pocket- 
money, a set of hanging bookshelves ; a portable desk, an 
easel, and two or three good engravings that adorned the 
walls. 

She locked the door after her, with a kind of angry satisfaction in her face, and going straight to the window, leaned 
upon the sash, and looked down into the flooded street. 
Her eyes were dry, but there was a heaving in her throat ; 
a tightening of the muscles about the mouth that would 
have made most women weep for very relief. Sarah Hunt 
would have scorned the ease purchased by such weakness. 
She did not despise the sad loneliness that girt her around, 
any more than the captive warrior does his cell of iron or 
stone, but she held that it would be a cowardly succumbing 
to Fate, to wound herself by dashing against the grim 
walls, or bring out their sleeping echoes by womanish wailings. So, presently, her throat ached and throbbed no 
longer ; the rigid muscles compressed the lips no more than 
was their wont ; the hands loosened their vise-like grasp of 
one another the brain was free to think. 

The rain fell still with a solemn stateliness that befitted 
the coming twilight. It was a silent storm for one so heavy. 
The faint hum of the city ; the tinkle of the car-bell, three 
blocks off, arose to her window above its plashing fall upon 
the pavement, and the trickle of the drops from sash to sill. 
A stream of light from the lamp-post at the corner flashed 
athwart the sidewalk, glittered upon the swollen gutter, 



 

made gold and silver blocks of the paving-stones. As if 
they had waited for this signal, other lights now shone out 
from the windows across the way, and from time to time a 
broad, transient gleam from opening doors, told of the return of fathers, brothers, husbands from their day's employment. 

" In happy homes he sees the light." 

What was there in the line that should make the watcher 
catch her breath in sudden pain, and lay her hand, with 
stifled moan, over her heart, as she repeated it aloud ? 

Witness with me, ye maternal Hunts, who read this page 
you, the careful and solicitous about many things in 
nothing; more ambitious than for the advancement and success in life of your offspring add your testimony to mine 
that this girl had all that was desirable for one of her age 
and in her circumstances. A house as handsome as her 
neighbors, an education unsurpassed by any of her late 
school-fellows, a " position in society ;" a reasonable share 
of good looks, which only required care and cultivation on 
her part, to become really distingue ; indulgent parents and 
peaceably inclined brothers and sisters ; read the list, and 
solve me, if you can, the enigma of this perturbed spirit 
this hungering and thirsting after contraband or unattainable pleasures. 

" Some girls will do so !" Mrs. Hunt assured her husband 
when he "thought that Sarah did not seem so happy as 
Lucy. He hoped nothing ailed the child. Perhaps the doc 
tor had better drop in to see her. Could she be fretting for 
any thing ? or had her feelings been hurt ?" 

" Bless your soul, Mr. H. ! there's nothing the matter 
with her. She always was- kind o queer !" (Mrs. Hunt did 
not use her company grammar every day), and she's jest 
eighteen year old. That's the whole of it! She'll come 
round in good time, specially if Lucy should marry off 



 

pretty soon. When Sarah is Miss Hunt, she'll be as crazy 
for beaux and company, and as ready to jump at a prime 
offer as any of em. I know girls ways !" 

Nor am I prepared to say that Sarah, as she quitted her 
look-out at the high window, at the sound of the dinner- 
bell, could have given a more satisfactory reason for her 
discontent and want of spirits. 



 



CHAPTER II. 

MRS. HUNT S china, like her grammar, was of two sorts. 
When her duty to " society" or the necessity of circum 
stances forced her to be hospitable, she "did the thing" 
well. At a notice of moderate length, she could get up a 
handsome, if not a bountiful entertainment, to which no 
man need have been ashamed to seat his friends, and when 
the occasion warranted the display, she grudged not the 
" other" china, the other silver, nor the other table-linen. 

She did, however, set her face, like a broad flint, against 
the irregularity of inviting chance visitors to partake of the 
family bread and salt. Intimate as Victoria West was with 
Lucy, she met only a civil show of regretful acquiescence in 
her proposal to go home, as the dinner hour approached ; 
and Robbie or Richard Hunt was promptly offered to escort 
her to her abode upon the next block. If she remained to 
luncheon, as she would do occasionally, Lucy, in her hearing, 
begged her mother to excuse them from going down, and 
to send up two cups of tea, and a few sandwiches to the 
sitting-room. This slight repast was served by the buther 
upon a neat little tray, in a tete-d-tete service a Christmas 
gift to Lucy, "from her ever-loving Victoria," and sen 
timentally dedicated to the use of the pair of adopted 
sisters. 

Therefore, Sarah was not surprised to find Victoria gone, 
despite the storm, when she entered the dining-room. An 
immense crumb-cloth covered the carpet ; a row of shrouded 



 

chairs, packed elbow to elbow, stood against the further 
end of the apartment, and a set of very ordinary ones were 
around the table. The cloth was of whity-brown material, 
and the dishes a motley collection of halt and maimed for 
all Mrs. Hunt's vigilance could not make servants miraculously careful. There was no propriety, however, according 
to her system of economy, in condemning a plate or cup as 
past service, because it had come off second best, to the extent of a crack, or nick, or an amputated handle in an en 
counter with some other member of the crockery tribe. 
" While there is life there is hope," was, in these cases, 
paraphrased by her to the effect that while a utensil would 
hold water, it was too good to be thrown away. 

It was not a sumptuous repast to which Sarah sat down 
after she had placed Jeannie in her high chair and tied the 
great gingham bib around her neck. On the contrary, it 
came near being a scant provision for the healthy appetites 
of seven people. Before Mr. Hunt, a mild, quiet little man, 
was a dish of stew, which was, in its peculiar line, a thing 
not of beauty but wonder. 

Only a few days since, as I stood near the stall of a 
poultry vender in market, a lady inquired for chickens. 

" Yes, ma 'am. Roasting size, ma 'am ?" 

" No ; I want them for a fricassee." 

" Ah" with a look of shrewd intelligence. " Then, 
ma 'am, I tal^e it, you don't care to have em overly tender. 
Most ladies prefers the old ones for fricassee ; Hhey come 
cheaper, and very often bile tender." 

"Thank you," was the amused rejoinder. "The dif 
ference in the price is no consideration where the safety of 
our teeth is concerned." 

Mrs. Hunt suffered not these scruples to hinder her 
negotiations with knowing poultry merchants. A cent less 
per pound would be three cents saved upon the chicken, 



 

and three cents would buy enough turnips for dinner. It 
is an ignorant housekeeper who needs to be informed that 
stewed chicken "goes further" than the same fowl made 
into any other savory combination. Mrs. Hunt's stews were 
concocted after a receipt of her own invention. Imprimis, 
one chicken, weight varying from two and a half to three 
pounds ; salt pork, a quarter of a pound ; gravy abundant ; 
dumplings innumerable. It was all " stew ;" and if Jean- 
nie's share was but a bare drumstick, swimming in gravy 
and buried in boiled dough, there was the chicken flavor 
through the portion, 

For classic antecedent the reader is referred to the fable 
of the rose-scented clay. 

To leave the principal dish, which justice to Mrs. Hunt's 
genius would not permit me to pass with briefer mention, 
there were, besides, potatoes, served whole (mashed ones 
required butter and cream), turnips, and bread, and Mrs. 
Hunt presided over a shallow platter of pork and beans. 
What was left of that dish would be warmed over to piece 
out breakfast next morning. The children behaved well, 
and the most minute by-law of table etiquette was observed 
with a strictness that imparted an air of ceremonious restraint to the meal. If Mrs. Hunt's young people were not 
in time finished ladies and gentlemen, it was not her fault, 
nor was it for the lack of drilling. 

" Do as J tell you, not as I do," were her orders in these 
matters. Since Lucy had completed her education, the 
mother added : " Look at your sister ; she is never 
awkward !" This was true : Lucy was born the fine lady. 
Refinement of manner and grace of movement, an instinc 
tive avoidance of whatever looked common or underbred 
were a part of her nature. Only the usage of years had 
accustomed her to her mother's somewhat "fussy" ways. 

Had she met her in company as Mrs. Anybody else, she 


would have yielded her the right of way with a feeling of 
amazement and amiable pity that one who meant so well 
should so often overdo the thing she aimed to accomplish 
easily and gracefully. Following out her excellent system 
of training, the worthy dame demanded as diligent and 
alert waiting from her buther as if she were having a dinner 
party. The eggless rice pudding was brought on with a 
state that was absolutely ludicrous ; but the family were 
used to the unsubstantial show, and took it as a matter of 
course. 

After the meal was over Mrs. Hunt withdrew to the 
kitchen for a short conference with the cook and a sharp 
glance through the closets. It was impossible that the 
abstraction of six slices of bread from the baking of the 
preceding day, three thick pieces of cheese, and more than 
half of the cold meat she had decided would, in the form of 
hash, supply the other piece of the breakfast at which the 
beans were to assist, should escape her notice. 

Mr. Hunt was reading the evening paper by the drop- 
light in the sitting room, Lucy was busy with her shawl, 
and Sarah told a simple tale in a low voice to Jeannie, as 
she leaned upon her lap, when the wife and mother entered, 
with something like a bluster. All present looked up, and 
each one remarked the cloud upon her brow. 

" What is the matter, mother ?" said Mr. Hunt, in a tone 
not free from alarm. 

" I am worried ! That's the whole of it ! I am down 
right vexed with you, Sarah, and surprised, too! What 
upon earth possessed you, child, to take that beggar into my 
kitchen to-day ? After all I have told you and tried to 
learn you about these shameful impostors ! I declare I was 
beat out when I heard it. And to throw away provisions 
and clothes upon such a brat !" 

Lucy opened her great eyes at her sister, and Mr. Hunt 



 

looked perplexedly towards Ms favorite, for at heart he was 
partial to his second child. 

" I took the poor creature to the fire, mother, because she 
was wet and cold ; I fed her because she was hungry ; I 
gave her some old, warm clothes of mine because hers were 
thin and soaked with rain." 

" Poor little girl !" murmured Jeannie, compassionately. 

Sarah's hand closed instantly over the little fingers. The 
simple-hearted babe understood and sympathized with her 
motive and act better than did her wiser elders. 

" Oh, I have no doubt she told a pitiful story, and shed 
enough tears to wet her through, if the rain had not done 
it already. If you listen to what these wretches say, and 
undertake to relieve their wants, you will soon have not a 
dress to your back nor a house over your head. Why 
didn't you send her to some society for the relief of the 
poor ?" 

" I did not know where to find one, ma 'am." 

This plain truth, respectfully uttered, confounded Mrs. 
Hunt for a second. 

" Mrs. James is one of the managers in a Benevolent As 
sociation," she said, recovering herself. " You had ought 
to have given your beggar her address." 

" Even if I had known that fact, mother, the girl would 
have been v obliged to walk half a mile hi the storm to find 
this one manager. What do you suppose Mrs. James would 
have done for her that was not in my power to perform ?" 

" She would have asked the child whereabouts she lived, 
and to-morrow she would have gone to hunt her up. If 
she found all as she had been told, which is not likely these 
creatures don't give a right direction once in ten times why, 
she would have brought the case before the board at their 
next meeting, and they would help them, if neither of her 
parents was a drinking character." 



 

" God help the poor !" ejiaculated Sarah, energetically. 
" God help the poor, if this is man's style of relieving his 
starving brother ! Mother, do you think that hunger 
pinches any the less when the famished being is told that 
next week or next month may bring him one good meal ? 
Will the promise of a bushel of coal or a blanket, to be 
given ten days hence, warm the limbs that are freezing to 
night ? Is present help for present need, then, always un 
safe, imprudent, insane ?" 

" That all sounds very fine, my dear." Mrs. Hunt grew 
cool as her daughter waxed warm. " But when you have 
seen as much of the world as I have, you will understand 
how necessary it is to be careful about believing all that we 
hear. Another thing you must not forget, and that is that 
we are not able to give freely, no matter how much disposed 
we may be to do so. Its pretty hard for a generous person 
to say No, but it can't be helped. People in our circumstances must learn this lesson." Mrs. Hunt sighed at 
thought of the curb put upon her benevolent desires by 
bitter necessity. " And after all, very few you've no idea 
how few of these pretended sufferers are really in want." 

This preluded a recital of sundry barefaced impositions 
and successful swindles practised upon herself and acquaintances, to which Mr. Hunt subjoined certain of his personal 
experiences, all tending to establish the principle that in a 
vast majority of cases of seeming destitution the supplicant 
was an accomplished rogue, and the giver of alms the victim 
of his own soft heart and a villain's wiles. Jeannie drank 
in every syllable, until her ideal beggar quite equalled the 
ogre who would have made a light supper off of Hop-o -my- 
Thumb and brothers. 

" You gave this match-girl no money, I hope ?" said Mrs. 
Hunt, at length. 

" I did not, madam. I had none to give her." Impelled 



 

by her straightforward sense of honesty that would not 
allow her to receive commendation for prudence she had 
not shown, she said, bravely : " but I lent her my umbrella 
upon her promise to return it to-morrow." 

" WELL !" 

Mrs. Hunt dropped her hands in her lap, and stared in 
speechless dismay at her daughter. Even her husband felt 
it his duty to express his disapprobation. 

" That was very unwise, my daughter. You will never 
see it again." 

"I think differently, father." 

" You are too easily imposed upon, Sarah. There is not 
the least probability that your property will be returned. 
Was it a good umbrella ?" 

" It was the one I always use." 

" Black silk, the best make, with a carved ivory handle 
cost six dollars a month ago !" gasped Mrs. Hunt. " I 
never heard of such a piece of shameful imprudence in all 
my born days ! and I shouldn't wonder if you never once 
thought to ask her where she lived, that you might send a 
police officer after it, if the little thief didn't bring it back 
to you?" 

" I did think of it." Sarah paused, then forced out the 
confession she foresaw would subject her to the charge of 
yet more ridiculous folly. " I did think of it, but con 
cluded to throw the girl upon her honor, not to suggest the 
theft to her by insinuating a doubt of her integrity." 

Mr. Hunt was annoyed with and sorry for the culprit, yet 
he could not help smiling at this high-flown generosity of 
confidence. " You are certainly the most unsophisticated 
girl of your age I ever met with, my daughter. I shall not 
mind the loss of the umbrella if it prove to be the means 
of giving you a lesson in human nature. In this world, 
dear, it will not do to wear your heart upon your sleeve. 



 

Never believe a pretty story until you have had the oppor 
tunity to ascertain for yourself whether it is true or false." 
And with these titbits of worldly wisdom, the cashier 
picked up his paper. 

" Six dollars ! I declare I don't know what to say to you, 
Sarah !" persisted the ruffled mother. " You cannot expect 
me to buy you another umbrella this season. You must 
give up your walks in damp weather after this. I can't say 
that I'm very sorry for that, though. I never did fancy 
your traipsing off two or three miles, rain or shine, like a 
sewing girl." 

" Very well, madam !" 

But, steadied by pride as was her voice, her heart sank at 
the possibility of resigning the exercise upon which she 
deemed that so much of her health, physical and mental, 
depended. These long, solitary walks were one of the un- 
American habits that earned for Sarah Hunt the reputation 
of eccentricity. They were usually taken immediately after 
breakfast, and few in the neighborhood who were abroad or 
happened to look out at that hour, were not familiar with 
the straight, proud figure, habited in its walking dress of 
gray and black, stout boots, and gray hat with black plume. 
It was a uniform selected by herself, and which her mother 
permitted her to assume, because it " looked genteel," and 
became the wearer. Especially did she enjoy these tramps 
when the threatening storm, in its early stages, kept others 
of her class and sex. at home. The untamed spirit found a 
fierce pleasure in wrestling with the wind; the hail that 
ushered in the snow-storm, as it beat in her face, called up 
lustre to the eye and warm color to the cheek. To a soul 
sickening of the glare and perfume of the artificial life to 
which she was confined, the roughest and wildest aspects of 
nature were a welcome change. 

I remember laughing heartily, as I doubt not you did 



 

also, dear reader, if you saw it, at a cut which appeared 
several years ago in the Punch department of Harper's 
Magazine. A " wee toddler," perhaps four years old, with 
a most lack-a-daisical expression upon her chubby visage, 
accosts her grandmother after this fashion : " I am tired of 
life, grandmamma ! The world is hollow, and my doll is 
stuffed with sawdust, and, if you please, ma 'am, I should 
like to go to a nunnery !" 

Yet, that there are natures upon which the feeling of emptiness and longing herein burlesqued seizes in mere babyhood 
is sadly true. And what wonder? From their cradles, 
hundreds of children, in our so-called better classes, are fed 
upon husks. A superficial education, in which all that is 
not showy accomplishment is so dry and uninviting that the 
student has little disposition to seek further for the rich 
kernel, the strong meat of knowledge, is the preparatory 
course to a premature introduction into the world, to many 
the only phase of life they are permitted to see, a scene 
where all is flash and froth, empty bubbles of prizes, chased 
by men and women with empty heads, and oh, how often 
empty, aching hearts ! Outside principles, outside affections, outside smiles, and most pitable of all, outside piety ! 
Penury of heart and stomach at home ; abroad a parade 
of reckless extravagance and ostentatious profession of fine 
feeling and liberal sentiments ! 

" Woe," cried the Preacher, " to them that make haste 
to be rich !" If he had lived in our day, in what biting 
terms of reprobation and contempt would he have declaimed against the insane ambition of those who forego 
the solid comforts of judicious expenditure of a moderate 
income would afford; spurn the holy quiet of domestic 
joys neglect soul with heart culture in their haste to seem 
rich, when Providence has seen that wealth is not to be 
desired for them ! Out upon the disgusting, indecent race 



 

and scramble! The worship of the golden calf is bad 
enough, but when this bestial idolatry rises to such a pitch 
of fanaticism, that in thousands of households, copies in 
pinchbeck and plated-ware are set up and served, the spectacle is too monstrous in its abomination ! This it is, that 
crowds our counting-rooms with bankrupts and our stateprisons with defaulters ; that is fast turning our ball-rooms 
and other places of fashionable rendezvous, into vile carica 
tures of foreign courts, foreign manners, and foreign vices ; 
while the people we ape our chosen models and exem 
plars hold their sides in inextinguishable laughter at the 
grave absurdity of our laborious imitation. It is no cause 
for marvel, that, in just retribution, there should be sent a 
panic-earthquake, every three years, to shake men to their 
senses. 

Such was the atmosphere in which Sarah Hunt had 
always lived. In the code subscribed to by her mother, 
and the many who lived and felt and panted and pushed as 
she did for social distinction, nothing was of real, absolute 
value except the hard cash. Gold and silver were facts. 
All things else were comparative in use and worth. The 
garment which, last winter, no lady felt dressed without, was 
an obsolete horror this season. The pattern of curtains and 
furniture that nearly drove the fortunate purchaser wild with 
delight, three years back, was now only fit for the auction 
room. In vain might the poor depleted husband plead for 
and extol their beauties. The fiat of fashion had gone forth, 
and his better half seasoned his food with lamentations, and 
moistened her pillow with tears until she carried her point. 
We have intimated that Sarah was a peculiar girl. Whence 
she derived her vigorous intellect ; her strong, original turn 
of thought ; her deep heart, was a puzzle to those who 
knew her parents. The mother was energetic, the father 
sensible, but both were commonplace, and followed, like 



 

industrious puppets, in the wake of others. They were 
pleased that Sarah brought home all the prizes offered at 
school, and both considered that she gained a right, by 
these victories, to pursue her studies at home, provided she 
did not obtrude her singular views and tastes upon other 
people. Mrs. Hunt sighed, frequently and loudly, in her 
presence, that her genius had not been for shell, or bead, or 
worsted work, instead of for reading volumes, that did not 
even decorate the show book-case in the library. 

" If you must have so many books, why don't you pick 
out them with the tasty bindings ?" she had asked her 
daughter more than once. " And I wish you would paint 
some bright, lively pictures, that would look handsome on
