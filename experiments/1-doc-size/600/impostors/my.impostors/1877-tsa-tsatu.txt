"And are you not satisfied to rest here?" asked 
the friend. 

" No," was the despondent reply. 

"Why not?" 

" Simply, because having broken the law, and 
thus offended God, I cannot see how forgiveness 
is possible. My early life was an insult to him. 
I'm ade light of his precepts ; I scorned the offers 
of salvation. When he said, Give me thy heart, 
I turned from him, and laid my heart an offering 
upon the shrine of this wicked world. And now, 



 

when I seek him, he hides his face from me. I 
am in terror, but he mocks at my fear." 

" Every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that 
seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh, it 
shall be opened." So answered the friend in 
words of divine truth. 

I again observed the lady 's face, to see how 
this clear declaration would aifect her. For a 
moment, it seemed to lighten ; but the shadow 
was not lifted. 

"It must be regarded only as an appearance 
that God is angry," I ventured here to remark. 
"Divine love infinite compassion are qualities 
adverse to anger. The wicked, under such suf 
fering and restraint as are the consequences of 
evil, naturally enough attribute their pains to the 
angry punishment of an offended God. And 
when God speaks in warning to the wicked, it is 
as a father to his disobedient children. He ap 
pears with signs of anger, though love and com 
passion are in his heart. There is a state of evil 
*mong men, which will obey no law but that of 



 

fear. The sword must be unsheathed, and the 
right arm bared, or the wicked will not submit. 
This is the state addressed, when anger and 
punishment are spoken of in the word. God 's 
infinite love, which yearns over every creature, 
was veiling itself under forms of wrath." 

She listened calmly, and with evident interest ; 
and did not offer any suggestions adverse to what 
I had said. Still, I could see no light drifting 
through the shadows on her face. Her mental 
condition interested me, and I endeavored to 
comprehend its meaning ; but, after a long con 
versation, I found myself unable to get down to 
the real cause of her morbid state. To the clear 
est teaching of the Bible, and the fairest conclu 
sions drawn therefrom, she had only her doubts 
to oppose. They were, enshrouding her like a 
pall, and no sun-rays of truth seemed strong 
enough to scatter them. 

" I cannot see it," was the answer she gave ; 
" and unless I can see it, what help for me is 

there in all you say ?" . 


 

J was interested in Mrs. Olney. So far as her 
outward life was concerned, she lived in obedience 
to the precepts of religion. She was always in 
her place at church, and among the foremost in 
the various uses of church membership a devout 
worshiper, and a doer of good deeds. If any, it 
seemed to me, were to live in the sunshine of spi 
ritual confidence, her sky, of all others, should 
have been clear. But, clouds and obscurity were 
there. 

" Do you know Mrs. Olney ?" I inquired of a 
most excellent lady, who was a member of the 
same church to which Mrs. Olney belonged. 

" I used to know her," was the answer received. 
" But we have not spoken for ten years." 

" I am sorry to hear you say this," I returned. 
"Mrs. Olney is a true woman, if I read her 
aright." 

"There is much in her character that I ad 
mire," said the lady, " and from all that I hear of 
her, she is trying to lead a good and useful life. 



 

But, she bears in her heart a spirit of unforgive- 
ness." 

" Towards whom ?" I asked. 

" Towards me," she answered. " I was so un 
fortunate as to offend her very deeply. The 
cause of offence I will not excuse. I am not sur 
prised that she became angry ; nor even that she 
refused, for a long time afterwards, to regard mo 
with anything but displeasure. The act, on my 
part has been sorely repented I have suffered, 
on account thereof, painful humiliation of spirit. 
I condemn it as wrong I have put far from me 
the spirit by which it was inspired ; and I believe, 
that, as a sin before God, it is not kept in remem 
brance against me. If Mrs. Olney could only 
forget and forgive !" 

I had now the clue to Mrs. Olney 's state. It 
was her own unforgiving spirit that clouded her 
mind. In her idea of God, there was an attribu 
tion of perverted human passions; and as she was 
not able to reach a state of forgiveness towards 
her friend, so she found it impossible to under- 



 

stand how God could put aside anger and receive 
her with divine forgiveness. 

"Have you made efforts towards a reconcilia 
tion?" I asked. 

" Not of late. After she became a member of 
our church, I several times purposely threw my 
self in her way; but she refused to meet my 
advances. Once, happening to be in the same 
company, where conversation was general, I responded to a remark which she had just made; 
but she took no notice of me whatever. On an 
other occasion we were introduced by a mutual 
friend, who was not aware that we had met be 
fore ; when she bowed icily, not even offering her 
hand and after standing in silence for a few mo 
ments, turned away, and moved to a distant part 
of the room." 

" Has she spoken against you ?" I further in 
quired. 

" I fear that she has, judging from the manner 
of a few who are her intimate friends. In seve 
ral instances, I have observed a drawing off from 



 

me, and a standing at a distance, of persons who 
were once familiar and friendly. The cause of 
this, right or wrong, I have laid at her door. 
Not that I believe her capable of trying to injure 
me through indulgence of any vindictive spirit 
for I think better of her Christianity than that ; 
but, not having forgiven me in her heart, she 
finds it impossible to think of me as being in any 
essential degree changed from what I was ten or 
fifteen years ago, and so not only retains her old 
dislike, but infuses something of its quality into 
the minds of her intimate friends." 

Now I understood Mrs. Olney 's case better. 
At our next meeting, I so managed the conversa 
tion, that it drifted towards herself and her un 
happy state of mind. Shadows gathered over her 
face ; all cheerfulness died away from her tone?. 

" I have thought of you a great deal, since our 
last conversation," said I. 

This expression of interest naturally opened 
her mind to anything I'm ight say. 



 

" The hindrance," I added, " must be in your 
self; for it cannot be in God." 

" If I knew the hindrance !" she sighed heavily. 

" Is it not possible," I suggested, " that some 
where in your heart, hidden away from distinct 
consciousness, dwells an unforgiving spirit ?" 

Her eyes were cast down as I spoke ; but, she 
raised them instantly from the floor, in a half 
startled way, fixing upon me a look of inquiry. 

"It often happens," I continued, "that our 
ideas of God take the hue of interior states. We 
can only think of him as like-minded with our 
selves. Angry at sin, because we are angry when 
the laws we make are violated ; unforgiving, be 
cause we cannot forgive those who trespass against 
us." 

She dropped her startled eyes away from mine, 
a jd let them rest upon the floor again. 

"There may be much involved in what you 
say," she remarked, not long afterwards, in a sub 
dued voice. " Some things are hard to forgive," 
she added, like one thinking aloud. 



 

"And yet," I ventured to say, "only in the 
degree that we forgive men their trespasses, can 
we expect God to forgive our trespasses in other 
words, there must be a forgiving state in our 
own hearts, before we can have any realizing 
sense of the Lord 's infinite forgiveness." 

Evidently, thought with her was flowing in a 
new direction. I did not think it well to press 
the subject, but left her to continue, or change it, 
as she might feel inclined. 

" Do you really think," she asked, " that God 
only forgives us in the degree that we exercise 
forgiveness towards others?" 

" Literally, that is the teaching of Scripture," 
was my reply. " ( If ye forgive not men their 
trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father for 
give your trespasses. But, going past the literal 
sense of this law, let us go down to its spirit. A 
state of true religion is a state of love love to 
God and the neighbor. If we cannot forgive, we 
cannot love. God is not angry he does not de 
cline forgiveness but, because of our unforgiving 



 

states, he cannot dwell with us in love. Ever he 
stands at the door, knocking, and asking for en 
trance. It is for us to open the door, by removing the evil things set in it as bars and bolts ; 
and until we do this, he cannot enter." 

A window was opened in the mind of Mrs. Ol- 
ney, through which clearer light came in. What 
she had regarded as only a just displeasure to 
wards one who had injured her in past times, but 
whose life in the present was, to human eyes, 
blameless, she now saw to have in it the hai d 
qualities of an unforgiving spirit. It was for 
what had been done to her, that she retained dislike. Mrs. Olney belonged to that class of per 
sons, who, when clearly satisfied in regard to any 
course of action, move forward with resolute self- 
compulsion. First she decided, that, as a Chris 
tian woman, she could no longer hold towards 
the lady of whom I have spoken the attitude of 
a stranger. Next came the question as to how 
the lady was to be approached ^whether for 
mally, and with oral reference to the past ; or, by 



 

friendly advances, when next they happened to 
be thrown together in company. The latter me 
thod was chosen ; and the opportunity was not 
long delayed. I was present, and witnessed the 
unobtrusive scene. Perhaps no other person had 
any conception of what it involved. 

The lady referred to, as having given offence 
to Mrs. Olney years before, was sitting on one end 
of a sofa. She had been conversing with a friend 
who had just risen and crossed the room, leaving 
the place at her side vacant. At this moment, I 
saw Mrs. Olney quietly pass over, and occupy the 
seat, offering her hand as she sat down. The 
hand was taken and held not at once relin 
quished. Both faces were in full view. That 
of Mrs. Olney was considerably heightened in 
color ; but, its expression, though subdued, was 
frank and kind. Over the other face, light was 
leaping ; and I saw sudden tears almost brim 
ming the eyes. Only for a short time, the na 
tural embarrassment of this meeting continued. 

The tender of forgiveness and Christian fellow- 


ship for all that was involved was so gladly 
accepted, that Mrs. Olney felt her heart begin 
ning to warm and glow, almost immediately, 
with new-born pleasures. 

For nearly the whole of that evening, these two 
old friends, between whom a gulf of years had, in 
a moment, been bridged over, kept close together. 
There was, in Mrs. Olney 's countenance, a new 
expression. All the clouds which had rested 
over it for so long a period were swept away, and 
peace dwelt there amid sunshine. The reconcili 
ation was complete. From that hour, they be 
came tenderly attached to each other ; and were 
inseparable co-workers in all the external things 
appertaining to their church membership. 

" You have come up from the valley of doubt," 
I said, in meeting her not long aftewards. 

" Yes," she answered. " I am not troubled as 
in former times. That strange, shadowed state 
of the soul no longer exists." 

" Were you conscious when and how it passed 



 

away? There is a lesson in your experience, 
from which others may profit." 

Mrs. Olney reflected for a little while. 

" It was all here," and she laid her hand over 
her heart. "God 's love was not withholdeu. 
The obstruction was in me. The memory of 
wrong was cherished, brooded over, held almost 
as a sweet morsel under my tongue. Not being 
able to forgive, I could not realize the possibility 
of forgiveness in God. The words of Scripture 
were plain enough ; and I tried to rest on them 
with confidence. But, external faith and interior 
conviction, are very different things. I was in 
darkness and doubt, and there seemed no hope 
for me. But, when the law of forgiveness ruled 
in my own soul, doubt and darkness fled away. 
It seemed as if I had passed from a narrow, suffo 
cating chamber, out into the free air, and under a 
cloudless sky. In the freedom of my new state, 
I am in wonder at the bondage from which I 
have been delivered. The process of cause and 
effect, I am unable to follow. I only know, that, 



 

whereas I was blind, now I see. God has not 
changed, for he is unchangeable. My own state 
has governed all." 

And so it is in very religious experience. 
Our own states determine our ideas of God. He 
is to us an angry God, because we are angry and 
vindictive towards others ; a hard exacter of legal 
penalties, because we will have the uttermost far 
thing ; slow to forgive, because there is a spirit 
of unforgiveness in our hearts. But, when love 
dwells with us, He is love. 




XII. 

IS IT WELL WITH YOU? 

" TS it well with you, my brother?" Such was 
 the preacher 's salutation. He was not a 
young man, standing erect in conscious strength, 
abounding in doctrine and clear in logic ; nor in 
the vigor of middle age, with full fruited boughs 
just beginning to droop from their proud erect- 
ness ; but an old man, in whom perception had 
taken the place of doctrine and logic wise be 
cause good. 

" Is it well with you, my brother ?" He had 
grasped the hand of one in whose house, for 
many "years, had been set apart a guest-chamber 
for the servant of God. 

" I trust that it is well with me," replied the 




 

host, as lie returned the old man 's greeting, and 
then led him into the house, giving him of the 
best he had to bestow. 

It was midday when the preacher arrived. In 
the evening, he sat alone with his brother in the 
church, talking on themes of immortal interest. 
At first, he was a listener ; and then the thought 
of his brother dwelt wholly in things of natural 
life. He spoke of his farm, his mill, his money 
at interest, and the prosperity with which God 
had blessed him. 

" He hath made my corn and wine to in 
crease," he said, with a confidence that was near 
to boastfulness. 

A faint sigh parted the old minister 's lips ; and 
a slight shadow veiled the sweet serenity of his 
countenance. 

" Have you never thought, my brother, that 
God 's increase of corn and wine, means something 
more than this ?" 

The question had a disturbing effect. 

" That there are corn and wine for the soul 's 



nourishment and growth, as well as corn and 
wine for the body ?" he added. 

" Doubtless it is so," replied the brother, with 
that marked falling of the voice which accompa 
nies the reluctant admission of truth in conflict 
with an existing state of mind. " We do not 
live by bread alone. And yet, God blesses us in 
our basket and store prospers us in our outgo 
ings and incomings." 

"His providence touches us in the minutest 
things of external life," answered the preacher. 
" When it is well with us, the blessing is from 
his hand. But, " well with us, has a higher sig 
nificance than you have expressed by the words 
basket and store. Is it well with you, my bro 
ther ? Let me put the question again. What is 
the state of your mind ?" 

" I trust in God," was returned, with unfalter 
ing speech. " I know in whom I have believed. 
Faith is the anchor of my soul." 

" Your acceptance is clear ?" 

" Yes." Not spoken with full confidence. 



 

There followed a brief silence. 

" It is the saddest of all sad things, a mistake 
in this, ray brother," the old man said, with an 
impressiveness that hurt his listener, for, both in 
language and tone was an intimation that he was 
building his immortal hopes on foundations that 
might not stand. 

" There are two elements that go to make up 
every state of mind," continued the preacher, 
after a pause in which there was no response, 
" thought and feeling. The thought is most ex 
terior, and in it we see reflected, as from a mirror, 
the feelings, the desires, the impulses that have 
in them the essential qualities of a man 's life. 
But, thought has wings, and the power to rise 
into higher and purer regions to separate itself, 
for brief periods, from its bondage to low and 
worldly desire ; and thence, the danger of self- 
deception of considering our states of ansient 
thought, and not our states of permanent feeling, 
as the just expression of the interior quality as it 


is seen by God. Do you apprehend me, my 
brother?" 

" In a degree," was answered. 

"As God sees us, so we are; and as we are, 
when death finds us, will be our state in the other 
life. Lovers of the Lord 's kingdom, or lovers of 
ourselves." 

"But, how can we see ourselves as God sees 
us ?" asked the brother, with a suddenly awaken 
ing concern. " He knows our hearts better than 
we can know them. Nay, He alone knows 
them." 

" True ; but He has given us the clearest in 
struction. His word is a lamp unto our feet and 
a light unto our path. It is full of heavenly 
teaching. Let us ponder a single passage, and 
bring onr individual lives to the standard therein 
proclaimed. Speaking of the godly, or regenerate 
man, the Psalmist says, His delight is in the law 
of the Lord. Mark the expression His delight. 
Now, feeling, of which delight is predicated, is 
interior to thought. When there is delight in 



 

the law, then there is meditation. First, the de 
light; then the medication not a mere transient 
uplifting of thought to purer regions, but a 
dwelling therein with love. Ah, my brother ! 
Do we not find a revelation in this brief passage, 
clear as noonday, and full of instruction ? Not 
one to discourage us, because our life falls far be 
low the state described; but one full of encou 
ragement, because it shows us that to which our 
heavenly Father wishes us to aspire. And now 
again, as one sent to you of God for I am his 
servant, and he has laid on me the duty of win 
ning souls let me ask, Is it well with you, my 
brother?" 

How very tenderly, in his seriousness, did the 
old man speak. There was nothing of ambassa 
dorial dignity ; nothing of conscious goodness ; 
nothing that said, "I am holier than thou." 
But such winning gentleness ; such pure concern ; 
such earnest solicitude, that the brother who had 
been losing his interest in spiritual things amid 
the absorbing life of natural good amid his 





farm, his mill, and his merchandise felt scales 
dropping away from the blinded eyes of his soul, 
and saw by that interior light which comes in 
from heaven. And seeing, he answered, with 
drooping head and falling voice 

" It is not well with me, I fear. My delight 
is not in the law of the Lord. I do not meditate 
thereon. Perpetually, my thought dwells in the 
things of this world. In my sowing and reaping; 
in my gathering and grinding; in my gaining and 
hoarding. Even as the rich husbandman in the 
gospel, whose harvests overflowed his barns, I 
have been planning to pull down mine and build 
greater, so as to lay up goods for many years. 
You have sent a tremor of fear through my 
heart ; and I hear a strange, solemn voice, ask 
ing, t What if thy soul be required of thee this 
night? " 

" Be wise, then, my brother. Yet do not take 
counsel of fear; for, in fear there is bondage. 
Love delight casteth out all fear. God 's true 
service is from love not fear. From aifection, not 



 

from constrained obedience. Is this clear to your 
mind?" 

"As noonday," was answered. 

" You did not see this a little while ago," said 
the preacher. 

" I knew that it was so ; knew it from 
thought but, until now, not from perception. 
Ah, my brother ! You have shown me a way to
