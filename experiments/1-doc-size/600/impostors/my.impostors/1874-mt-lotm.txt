called the “ strong and pervasive religious look of the 
town,” but I could not see that it looked more religious 
than the other hill towns with the same slope and built 
of the same kind of bricks. Partialities often make 
people see more than really exists. 

Uncle Mumford has been thirty years a mate on the 
river. He is a man of practical sense and a level 
head; has observed; has had much experience of one 
sort and another; has opinions; has, also, just a per- 
ceptible dash of poetry in his composition, an easy 
gift of speech, a thick growl in his voice, and an oath 
or two where he can get at them when the exigencies 
of his office require a spiritual lift. He is a mate of 

the blessed old-time kind ; and goes gravely d ing 

around, when there is work to the fore, in a way to 
mellow the ex-steamboatman’s heart with sweet, soft 
longings for the vanished days that shall come no 

more. “ Git up, there, you ! Going to be 

all day? Why d’n’t you say you was petrified in your 
hind legs, before you shipped?** 

He is a steady man with his crew; kind and just, 
but firm; so they like him, and stay with him. He is 
still in the slouchy garb of the old generation of mates ; 
but next trip the Anchor Line will have him in uni- 
form — a natty blue naval uniform, with brass buttons, 
along with all the officers of the line — and then he 
will be a totally different style of scenery from what he 
is now. 

Uniforms on the Mississippi ! It beats all the other 
changes put together, for surprise. Still, there is 
another surprise — that it was not made fifty years 
ago* It is so manifestly sensible that it might have 
been thought of earlier, one would suppose. During 
fifty years, out there, the innocent passenger in need 
of help and information has been mistaking the mate 
for the cook, and the captain for the barber — and 

being roughly entertained for it, too. But his troubles 
are ended now. And the greatly improved aspect of 
the boat’s staff is another advantage achieved by the 
dress-reform period. 

Steered down the bend below Cape Girardeau. 
They used to call it “ Steersman's Bend ”; plain sail- 
ing and plenty of water in it, always ; about the only 
place in the Upper River that a new cub was allowed to 
take a boat through, in low water. 

Thebes, at the head of the Grand Chain, and Com- 
merce at the foot of it, were towns easily remember- 
able, as they had not undergone conspicuous altera- 
tion. Nor the Chain, either — in the nature of things; 
for it is a chain of sunken rocks admirably arranged to 
capture and kill steamboats on bad nights. A good 
many steamboat corpses lie buried there, out of sight; 
among the rest my first friend, the Paul Jones ; she 
knocked her bottom out, and went down like a pot, so 
the historian told me — Uncle Mumford. He said she 
had a gray mare aboard, and a preacher. To me, this 
sufficiently accounted for the disaster; as it did, of 
course, to Mumford, who added : 

'' But there are many ignorant people who would 
scoff at such a matter, and call it superstition. But 
you will always notice that they are people who have 
never traveled with a gray mare and a preacher. I 
went down the river in such company. We grounded 
at Bloody Island; we grounded at Hanging Dog; we 
grounded just below this same Commerce; we jolted 
Beaver Dam Rock ; we hit one of the worst breaks in 
the ‘Graveyard' behind Goose Island; we had a 
roustabout killed in a fight ; we burst a boiler ; broke 
a shaft ; collapsed a flue ; and went into Cairo with 
nine feet of water in the hold — may have been more, 
may have been less. I remember it as if it were 
yesterday. The men lost their heads with terror. 



They painted the mare blue, in sight of town, and 
threw the preacher overboard, or we should not have 
arrived at all. The preacher was fished out and saved. 
He acknowledged, himself, that he had been to blame. 
I remember it all, as if it were yesterday.’ * 

That this combination — of preacher and gray mare 

— should breed calamity seems strange, and at first 
glance unbelievable; but the fact is fortified by so 
much unassailable proof that to doubt is to dishonor 
reason. I myself remember a case where a captain 
was warned by numerous friends against taking a gray 
mare and a preacher with him, but persisted in his 
purpose in spite of all that could be said; and the 
same day — it may have been the next, and some say 
it was, though I think it was the same day — he got 
drunk and fell down the hatchway and was borne to 
his home a corpse. This is literally true. 

No vestige of Hat Island is left now; every shred of 
it is washed away. I do not even remember what part 
of the river it used to be in, except that it was between 
St. Louis and Cairo somewhere. It was a bad region 

— all around and about Hat Island, in early days. A 
farmer, who lived on the Illinois shore there, said that 
twenty-nine steamboats had left their bones strung 
along within sight from his house. Between St. Louis 
and Cairo the steamboat wrecks average one to the 
mile — two hundred wrecks, altogether. 

I could recognize big changes from Commerce down. 
Beaver Dam Rock was out in the middle of the river 
now, and throwing a prodigious “break” ; it used to 
be. close to the shore, and boats went down outside of 
it. A big island that used to be away out in mid-river 
has retired to the Missouri shore, and boats do not go 
near it any more. The island called Jacket Pattern is 
whittled down to a wedge now, and is booked for early 
destruction. Goose Island is all gone but a little dab. 
the size of a steamboat. The perilous 4 Graveyard,” 
among whose numberless wrecks we used to pick our 
way so slowly and gingerly, is far away from the 
channel now, and a terror to nobody. One of the 
islands formerly called the Two Sisters is gone en- 
tirely ; the other, which used to lie close to the Illinois 
shore, is now on the Missouri side, a mile away; it is 
joined solidly to the shore, and it takes a sharp eye to 
see where the seam is — but it is Illinois ground yet, 
and the people who live on it have to ferry themselves 
over and work the Illinois roads and pay Illinois taxes: 
singular state of things ! 

Near the mouth of the river several islands were 
missing — washed away. Cairo was still there — easily 
visible across the long, flat point upon whose further 
verge it stands; but we had to steam a long way 
around to get to it. Night fell as we were going out 
of the " Upper River ” and meeting the floods of the 
Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety; for the 
hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has 
moved up stream a long distance out of the channel ; 
or rather, about one county has gone into the river 
from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has 
"made down ” and added to its long tongue of terri- 
tory correspondingly. The Mississippi is a just and 
equitable river; it never tumbles one man’s farm over- 
board without building a new farm just like it for that 
man’s neighbor. This keeps down hard feelings. 

Going into Cairo, we came near killing a steamboat 
which paid no attention to our whistle and then tried 
to cross our bows. By doing some strong backing, 
we saved him; which was a great loss, for he would 
have made good literature. 

Cairo is a brisk town now; and is substantially 
built, and has a city look about it which is in noticeable 
contrast to its former estate, as per Mr. Dickens’ 
portrait of it. However, it was already building with 
bricks when I had seen it last — which was when 
Colonel (now General) Grant was drilling his first 
command there. Uncle Mumford says the libraries 
and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo, 
as well as the brick masons. Cairo has a heavy rail- 
road and river trade, and her situation at the junction 
of the two great rivers is so advantageous that she 
cannot well help prospering. 

When I turned out in the morning, we had passed 
Columbus, Ky., and were approaching Hickman, a 
pretty town perched on a handsome hill. Hickman is 
in a rich tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a great 
and lucrative trade in that staple, collecting it there in 
her warehouses from a large area of country and ship- 
ping it by boat; but Uncle Mumford says she built a 
railway to facilitate this commerce a little more, and he 
thinks it facilitated it the wrong way — took the bulk 
of the trade out of her hands by “ collaring it along 
the line without gathering it at her doors.’  



CHAPTER XXVI. 


UNDER FIRE 

TALK began to run upon the war now, for we were 
getting down into the upper edge of the former 
battle-stretch by this time. Columbus was just behind 
us, so there was a good deal said about the famous 
battle of Belmont. Several of the boat’s officers had 
seen active service in the Mississippi war-fleet. I 
gathered that they found themselves sadly out of their 
element in that kind of business at first, but afterward 
got accustomed to it, reconciled to it, and more or less 
at home in it. One of our pilots had his first war ex- 
perience in the Belmont fight, as a pilot on a boat in 
the Confederate service. I had often had a curiosity 
to know how a green hand might feel, in his maiden 
battle, perched all solitary and alone on high in a pilot- 
house, a target for Tom, Dick, and Harry, and nobody 
at his elbow to shame him from showing the white 
feather when matters grew hot and perilous around him ; 
so to me his story was valuable — it filled a gap for me 
which all histories had left till that time empty. 

He said : 

“ It was the 7th of November. The fight began at 
seven in the morning. I was on the jR. H. W. Hill . 
Took over a load of troops from Columbus. Came 
back, and took over a battery of artillery. My partner 

said he was going to see the fight ; wanted me to go 
along. I said, No, I wasn't anxious, I would look at 
it from the pilot-house. He said I was a coward, and 
left. 

“ That fight was an awful sight. General Cheatham 
made his men strip their coats off and .throw them in a 

pile, and said, ‘ Now follow me to our victory ! ’ 

I heard him say that from the pilot-house ; and then he 
galloped in, at the head of his troops. Old General 
Pillow, with his white hair, mounted on a white horse, 
sailed in, too; leading his troops as lively as a boy. 
By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and 
here they came ! tearing along, everybody for himself 
and Devil take the hindmost ! and down under the bank 
they scrambled, and took shelter. I was sitting with 
my legs hanging out of the pilot-house window. All 
at once I noticed a whizzing sound passing my ear. 
Judged it was a bullet. I didn't stop to think about 
anything, I just tilted over backward and landed on the 
floor, and stayed there. The balls came booming 
around. Three cannon balls went through the chim- 
ney ; one ball took off the corner of the pilot-house ; 
shells were screaming and bursting all around. Mighty 
warm times — I wished I hadn't come. I lay there on 
the pilot-house floor, while the shots came faster and 
faster. I crept in behind the big stove, in the middle 
of the pilot-house. Presently a minie-ball came through 
the stove, and just grazed my head and cut my hat. 
I judged it was time to go away from there. The cap- 
tain was on the roof with a red-headed major from 
Memphis — a fine looking man. I heard him say he 
wanted to leave here, but ‘ that pilot is killed.' I crept 
over to the starboard side to pull the bell to set her 
back; raised up and took a look, and I saw about 
fifteen shot-holes through the window-panes ; had come 
so lively I hadn’t noticed them. I glanced out on the 
water, and the spattering shot were like a hail-storm. 
I thought best to get out of that place. I went down 
the pilot-house guy head first — not feet first but head 
first — slid down — before I struck the deck, the cap- 
tain said we must leave there. So I climbed up the 
guy and got on the floor again. About that time they 
collared my partner and were bringing him up to the 
pilot-house between two soldiers. Somebody had said 
I was killed. He put his head in and saw me on the 
floor reaching for the backing-bells. He said, ‘ Oh, 

h 1! he ain’t shot,' and jerked away from the men 

who had him by the collar, and ran below. We were 
there until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then got 
away all right. 

“The next time I saw my partner, I said, ‘Now, 
come out; be honest, and tell me the truth. Where 
did you go when you went to see that battle ? * He 
says, ‘ I went down in the hold.* 

“All through that fight I was scared nearly to death. 
I hardly knew anything, I was so frightened ; but you 
see, nobody knew that but me. Next day General Polk 
sent for me, and praised me for my bravery and gallant 
conduct. 

“ I never said anything, I let it go at that. I judged 
it wasn't so, but it was not for me to contradict a 
general officer. 

“ Pretty soon after that I was sick, and used up, and 
had to go off to the Hot Springs. When there, I got 
a good many letters from commanders 'saying they 
wanted me to come back. I declined, because I wasn't 
well enough or strong enough; but I kept still, and 
kept the reputation I had made." 

A plain story, straightforwardly told ; but Mumford 
told me that that pilot had ‘ * gilded that scare of his, in 
spots"; that his subsequent career in the war was 
proof of it.



We struck down through the chute of Island No. 8, 
and I went below and fell into conversation with a 
passenger, a handsome man, with easy carriage and an 
intelligent face. We were approaching Island No. io, 
a place so celebrated during the war. This gentleman’s 
home was on the main shore in its neighborhood. I 
had some talk with him about the war times; but 
presently the discourse fell upon “feuds,” for in no 
part of the South has the vendetta flourished more 
briskly, or held out longer between warring families, 
than in this particular region. This gentleman said: 

“ There’s been more than one feud around here, in 
old times, but I reckon the first one was between the 
Darnells and the Watsons. Nobody don’t know now 
what the first quarrel was about, it’s so long ago; the 
Darnells and the Watsons don’t know, if there’s any of 
them living, which I don’t think there is. Some says 
it was about a horse or a cow — anyway, it was a little 
matter; the money in it wasn’t of no consequence — 
none in the world — both families was rich. The 
thing could have been fixed up, easy enough; but no, 
that wouldn’t do. Rough words had been passed; 
and so, nothing but blood could fix it up after that. 
That horse or cow, whichever it was, cost sixty years 
of killing or crippling ! Every year or so somebody 
was shot, on one side or the other ; and as fast as one 
generation was laid out, their sons took up the feud 
and kept it a-going. And it’s just as I say; they went 
on shooting each other, year in and year out — making 
a kind of a religion of it, you see — till they’d done 
forgot, long ago, what it was all about. Wherever a 
Darnell caught a Watson, or a Watson caught a 
Darnell, one of ’em was going to get hurt — only 
question was, which of them got the drop on the other. 
They’d shoot one another down, right in the presence 
of the family. They didn’t hunt for each other, but 
when they happened to meet, they pulled and begun. 
Men would shoot boys, boys would shoot men. A 
man shot a boy twelve years old — happened on him 
in the woods, and didn’t give him no chance. If he 
had ’a’ given him a chance, the boy’d ’a’ shot him . 
Both families belonged to the same church (everybody 
around here is religious) ; through all this fifty or sixty 
years’ fuss, both tribes was there eveiy Sunday, to wor- 
ship. They lived each side of the line, and the church 
was at a landing called Compromise. Half the church 
and half the aisle was in Kentucky, the other half 
in Tennessee. Sundays you’d see the families drive 
up, all in their Sunday clothes — men, women, and 
children — and file up the aisle, and set down, quiet and 
orderly, one lot on the Tennessee side of the chufch 
and the other on the Kentucky side ; and the men and 
boys would lean their guns up against the wall, handy, 
and then all hands would join in with the prayer and 
praise; though they say the man next the aisle didn’t 
kneel down, along with the rest of the family; kind 
of stood guard. I don’t know; never was at that 
church in my life; but I remember that that’s what 
used to be said. 

“ Twenty or twenty-five years ago one of the feud 
families caught a young man of nineteen out and killed 
him. Don’t remember whether it was the Darnells 
and Watsons, or one of the other feuds; but anyway, 
this young man rode up — steamboat laying there at 
the time — and the first thing he saw was a whole gang 
of the enemy. He jumped down behind a wood-pile, 
but they rode around and begun on him, he firing back, 
and they galloping and cavorting and yelling and bang- 
ing away with all their might. Think he wounded a 
couple of them ; but they closed in on him and chased 
him into the river; and as he swum along down 
stream, they followed along the bank and kept on 
shooting at him, and when he struck shore he was 
dead. Windy Marshall told me about it. He saw it. 
He was captain of the boat. 

“Years ago, the Darnells was so thinned out that 
the old man and his two sons concluded they’d leave 
the country. They started to take steamboat just above 
No. io; but the Watsons got wind of it; and they 
arrived just as the two young Darnells was walking up 
the companionway with their wives on their arms. 
The fight begun then, and they never got no further — 
both of them killed. After that, old Darnell got into 
trouble with the man that run the ferry, and the ferry- 
man got the worst of it — and died. But his friends 
shot old Darnell through and through — filled him full 
of bullets, and ended him.” 

The country gentleman who told me these things 
had been reared in ease and comfort, was a man of 
good parts, and was college-bred. His loose grammar 
was the fruit of careless habit, not ignorance. This 
habit among educated men in the West is not universal, 
but it is prevalent — prevalent in the towns, certainly, 
if not in the cities ; and to a degree which one cannot 
help noticing, and marveling at. I heard a Westerner, 
who would be accounted a highly educated man in any 
country, say, “ Never mind, it don't make no difference , 
anyway.” A life-long resident who was present heard 
it, but it made no impression upon her. She was able 
to recall the fact afterward, when reminded of it; but 
she confessed that the words had not grated upon her 
ear at the time — a confession which suggests that if 
educated people can hear such blasphemous grammar, 
from such a source, and be unconscious of the deed, 
the crime must be tolerably common — so common 
that the general ear has become dulled by familiarity 
mth it, and is no longer alert, no longer sensitive to 
such affronts. 



No one in the world speaks blemishless grammar; 
no one has ever written it — no one, either in the world 
or out of it (taking the Scriptures for evidence on the 
latter point) ; therefore it would not be fair to exact 
grammatical perfection from the peoples of the Valley; 
but they and all other peoples may justly be required 
to refrain from knowingly and purposely debauching 
their grammar. 

I found the river greatly changed at Island No. io. 
The island which I remembered was some three miles 
long and a quarter of a mile wide, heavily timbered, 
and lay near the Kentucky shore — within two hundred 
yards of it, I should say. Now, however, one had to 
hunt for it with a spy-glass. Nothing was left of it but 
an insignificant little tuft, and this was no longer near 
the Kentucky shore; it was clear over against the 
opposite shore, a mile away. In war times the island 
had been an important place, for it commanded the 
situation; and, being heavily fortified, there was no 
getting by it. It lay between the upper and lower 
divisions of the Union forces, and kept them separate, 
until a junction was finally effected across the Missouri 
neck of land ; but the island being itself joined to that 
neck now, the wide river is without obstruction. 

In this region the river passes from Kentucky into 
Tennessee, back into Missouri, then back into Kentucky, 
and thence into Tennessee again. So a mile or two of 
Missouri sticks over into Tennessee. 

The town of New Madrid was looking very unwell; 
but otherwise unchanged from its former condition and 
aspect. Its blocks of frame houses were still grouped 
in the same old flat plain, and environed by the same 
old forests. It was as tranquil as formerly, and appar- 
ently had neither grown nor diminished in size. It was 
said that the recent high water had invaded it and 
damaged its looks. This was surprising news; for in 
low water the river bank is very high there (fifty feet), 
and in my day an overflow had always been considered 
an impossibility. This present flood of 1882 will 
doubtless be celebrated in the river's history for 
several generations before a deluge of like magnitude 
shall be seen. It put all the unprotected low lands 
under water, from Cairo to the mouth ; it broke down 
the levees in a great many places, on both sides of the 
river; and in some regions south, when the flood was 
at its highest, the Mississippi was seventy miles wide ! 
a number of lives were lost, and the destruction of 
property was fearful. The crops were destroyed, 
houses washed away, and shelterless men and cattle 
forced to take refuge on scattering elevations here and 
there in field and forest, and wait in peril and suffering 
until the boats put in commission by the national and 
local governments, and by newspaper enterprise, could 
come and rescue them. The properties of multitudes 
of people were under water for months, and the poorer 
ones must have starved by the hundred if succor had 
not been promptly afforded.* The water had been 
falling during a considerable time now, yet as a rule we 
found the banks still under water. 

 For a detailed and interesting description of the great flood, written on 
board of the New Orleans Times-Dcmorrafs relief boat, see Appendix A. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

SOME IMPORTED ARTICLES 

W E met two steamboats at New Madrid. Two 
steamboats in sight at once ! An infrequent 
spectacle now in the lonesome Mississippi. The lone- 
liness of this solemn, stupendous flood is impressive — 
and depressing. League after league, and still league 
after league, it pours its chocolate tide along, between 
its solid forest walls, its almost untenanted shores, with 
seldom a sail or a moving object of any kind to disturb 
the surface and break the monotony of the blank, 
watery solitude; and so the day goes, the night comes, 
and again the day — and still the same, night after 
night and day after day, — majestic, unchanging same- 
ness of serenity, repose, tranquillity, lethargy, vacancy, 
— symbol of eternity, realization of the heaven pictured 
by priest and prophet, and longed for by the good and 
thoughtless ! 

Immediately after the war of 1812 tourists began to 
come to America, from England ; scattering ones at first, 
then a sort of procession of them — a procession which 
kept up its plodding, patient march through the land dur- 
ing many, many years. Each tourist took notes, and went 
home and published a book — a book which was usually 
calm, truthful, reasonable, kind; but which seemed just 
the reverse to our tender-footed progenitors. A glance 
at these tourist-books shows us that in certain of its 
aspects the Mississippi has undergone no change since 
those strangers visited it, but remains to-day about as 
it was then. The emotions produced in those foreign 
breasts by these aspects were not ail formed on one 
pattern, of course; they had to be various, along at 
first, because the earlier tourists were obliged to origi- 
nate their emotions, whereas in older countries one can 
always borrow emotions from one's predecessors. And, 
mind you, emotions are among the toughest things in 
the world to manufacture out of whole cloth; it is 
easier to manufacture seven facts than one emotion. 
Captain Basil Hall, R. N., writing fifty-five years ago, 
says: 

Here I caught the first glimpse of the object I had so long wished to be- 
hold, and felt myself amply repaid at that moment for all the trouble I had 
experienced in coming so far; and stood looking at the river flowing past 
till it was too dark to distinguish anything. But it was not until I had 
lisited the same spot a dozen times that I came to a right comprehension of 
The grandeur of the scene. 

Following are Mrsl Trollope’s emotions. She is 
writing a few months later in the same year, 1827, and 
is coming in at the mouth of the Mississippi : 

The first indication of our approach to land was the appearance of this 
mighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters, and mingling with the 
deep blue of the Mexican Gulf. I never beheld a scene so utterly desolate 
as this entrance of the Mississippi. Had Dante seen it, he might have 
drawn images of another Bolgia from its horrors. One only object rears 
itself above the eddying waters; this is the mast of a vessel long since 
wrecked in attempting to cross the bar, and it still stands, a dismal witness of 
the destruction that has been, and a boding prophet of that which is to come. 

Emotions of Hon. Charles Augustus Murray (near 
St. Louis), seven years later: 

It is only when you ascend the mighty current for fifty or a hundred 
miles, and use the eye of imagination as well as that of nature, that you 
begin to understand all his might and majesty. You see him fertilizing a 
boundless valley, bearing along in bis course tbe trophies of his thousand 
victories over the shattered forest — here carrying away large masses of soil 
with all their growth, and there forming islands destined at some future 
period to be the residence of man; and while indulging in this prospect, it 
is then time for reflection to suggest that the current before you has flowed 
through two or three thousand miles, and has yet to travel one thousand 
three hundred more before reaching its ocean destination. 

Receive, now, the emotions of Captain Marryat, 
R. N., author of the sea tales, writing in 1837, three 
years after Mr. Murray : 

Never, perhaps, in the records of nations, was there an instance of a 
century of such unvarying and unmitigated crime as is to be collected from 
the history of the turbulent and blood-stained Mississippi. The stream itself 
appears as if appropriate for the deeds which have been committed. It is not 
like most rivers, beautiful to the sight, bestowing fertility in its course; not one 
that the eye loves to dwell upon as it sweeps along, nor can you wander upon 
its bank, or trust yourself without danger to its stream. It is a furious, rapid, 
deso rating torrent, loaded with alluvial soil ; and few of those who are 
received into its waters ever rise again,* or can support themselves long 
upon its surface without assistance from some friendly log. It contains the 
coarsest and most uneatable of fish, such as catfish and such genus, and, as 
you descend, its banks are occupied with the fetid alligator, while the 
panther basks at its edge in the cane-brakes, almost impervious to man. 
Pouring its impetuous waters through wild tracts covered with trees of little 
value except for firewood, it sweeps down whole forests in its course, 
which disappear in tumultuous confusion, whirled away by the stream 
now loaded with the masses of soil which nourished their roots, 
often blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the river, 
which, as if in anger at its being opposed, inundates and devastates the 
whole country round; and as soon as it forces its way through its former 
channel, plants in every direction the uprooted monarchs of the forest 
(upon whose branches the bird will never again perch, or the raccoon, the 
opossum, or the squirrel climb) as traps to the adventurous navigators of its 
waters by steam, who, borne down by these concealed dangers which pierce 


through the planks, very often have not time to steer for and gain the shore
