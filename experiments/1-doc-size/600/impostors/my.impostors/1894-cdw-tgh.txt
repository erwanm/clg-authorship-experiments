of the island. Alas ! did ever a man escape him- 
self in a retreat ? It made him calm for the mo- 
ment. But why was it, he asked himself, that he 
had so many followers, his religion so few ? Why 
was it, he said, that all the humanitarians, the re- 
formers, the guilds, the ethical groups, the agnostics, 
the male and female knights, sustained him, and 
only a few of the poor and friendless knocked, by 
his solicitation, at the supernatural door of life? 
How was it that a woman whom he encountered 
so often, a very angel of mercy, could do the things 
he was doing, tramping about in the misery and 
squalor of the great city day and night, her path 
umlluminated by a ray from the future life? 

Perhaps he had been remiss in his duty. Per- 
haps he was letting a vague philanthropy take the 
place of a personal solicitude for individual souls. 
The elevation of the race! What had the land 
question to do with the salvation of man ? Suppose 
everybody on the East Side should become as in- 
dustrious, as self-denying, as unselfish as Ruth Leigh, 
and yet without belief, without hope ! He had ac- 
cepted the humanitarian situation with her, and 
never had spoken to her of the eternal life. What 
unfaithfulness to his mission and to her! It should 
be so no longer. 

It was after one of his weeks of retreat, at the 



close of vesper service, that Dr. Leigh came to him. 
He had been saying in his little talk that poverty 
is no excuse for irreligion, and that all aid in the 
hardship of this world was vain and worthless un- 
less the sinner laid hold on eternal life. Dr. Leigh, 
who was laboring with a serious practical problem, 
heard this coldly, and with a certain contempt for 
what seemed to her a vague sort of consolation. 

" Well," he said, when she came to him in the 
vestry, with a drop from the rather austere manner 
in which he had spoken, " what can I do for you ?" 

" For me, nothing, Father Damon. I thought 
perhaps you would go round with me to see a pret- 
ty bad case. It is in your parish." 

" Ah, did they send for me ? Do they want spir- 
itual help?" 

" First the natural, then the spiritual," she re- 
plied, with a slight tone of sarcasm in her voice. 
" That's just like a priest," she was thinking. " I 
do not know what to do, and something must be 
done." 

" Did you report to the Associated Charities ?" 

" Yes. But there's a hitch somewhere. The ma- 
chine doesn't take hold. The man says he doesn't 
want any charity, any association, treating him like 
a pauper. He's off peddling ; but trade is bad, and 
he's been away a week. I'm afraid he drinks a 
little." 

"Well?" 



" The mother is sick in bed. I found her trying 
to do some fine stitching, but she was too weak to 
hold up the muslin. There are five young children. 
The family never has had help before." 

Father Damon put on his hat, and they went out 
together, and for some time picked their way along 
the muddy streets in silence. 

At length he asked, in a softened voice, " Is the 
mother a Christian ?" 

" I didn't ask," she replied, shortly. " I found 
her crying because the children were hungry." 

Father Damon, still under the impression of his 
neglect of duty, did not heed her warning tone, 
but persisted, " You have so many opportunities, 
Dr. Leigh, in your visits of speaking a word." 

"About what?" she asked, refusing to under- 
derstand, and hardened at the slightest sign of 
what she called cant. 

" About the necessity of repentance and prepa- 
ration for another life," he answered, softly but 
firmly. " You surely do not think human beings 
are created just for this miserable little experience 
here?" 

" I don't know. I have too much to do with the 
want and suffering I see to raise anxieties about a 
world of which no one can possibly know any- 
thing." 

" Pardon me," he persisted, " have you no sense 
of incompleteness in this life, in your own life? 



no inward consciousness of an undying person- 
ality?" 

The doctor was angry for a moment at this intru- 
sion. It had seemed natural enough for Father 
Damon to address his exhortations to the poor and 
sinful of his mission. She admired his spirit, she 
had a certain sympathy with him ; for who could 
say that ministering to minds diseased might not 
have a physical influence to lift these people into a 
more decent and prosperous way of living ? She 
had thought of herself as working with him to a 
common end. But for him now to turn upon her, 
absolutely ignoring the solid, rational, and scien- 
tific ground on which he knew, or should know, 
she stood, and to speak to her as one of the " lost," 
startled her, and filled her with indignation. She 
had on her lips a sarcastic reply to the effect that, 
even if she had a soul, she had not taken up her 
work in the city as a means of saving it; but she 
was not given to sarcasm, and before she spoke she 
looked at her companion, and saw in the eyes a look 
of such genuine humble feeling, contradicting the 
otherwise austere expression of his face, that her 
momentary bitterness passed away. 

" I think, Father Damon," she said, gently, " we 
had better not talk of that. I don't have much 
time for theorizing, you know, nor much inclina- 
tion," she added. 

The priest saw that for the present he could 







make no progress, and after a little silence the 
conversation went back to the family they \vere 
about to visit. 

They found the woman better at least, more 
cheerful. Father Damon noticed that there were 
medicines upon the stand, and that there were the 
remains of a meal which the children had been 
eating. He turned to the doctor. "I see that 
you have been providing for them." 

" Oh, the eldest boy had already been out and 
begged a piece of bread when I came. Of course 
they had to have something more at once. But it 
is very little that I can do." 

He sat down by the bed, and talked with the 
mother, getting her story, while the doctor tidied 
up the room a bit, and then, taking the youngest 
child in her lap and drawing the others about her, 
began to tell a story in a low voice. Presently she 
was aware that the priest was on his knees and say- 
ing a prayer. She stopped in her story, and looked 
out through the dirty window into the chill and 
dark area. 

" What is he doing ?" whispered one of the chil- 
dren. 

" I don't know," she said, and a sort of chill came 
over her heart. It all seemed a mockery, in these 
surroundings. 

When he rose he said to the woman, "We will see 
that you do not want till your husband comes back." 







" And I will look in to-morrow," said the doctor. 

When they were in the street. Father Damon 
thanked her for calling his attention to the case, 
thanked her a little formally, and said that he 
would make inquiries and have it properly attend- 
ed to. And then he asked : " Is your work ended 
for the day ? You must be tired." 

"Oh no; I have several visits to make. I'm 
not tired. I rather think it is good for me, being 
out-of-doors so much." She thanked him, and said 
good-by. 

For a moment he stood and watched the plain, 
resolute little woman threading her way through 
the crowded and unclean street, and then slowly 
walked away to his apartment, filled with sadness 
and perplexity. 

The apartment which he occupied was not far 
from the mission chapel, and it was the one clean 
spot among the ill-kept tenements ; but as to com- 
fort, it was not much better than the cell of an 
anchorite. Of this, however, he was not thinking 
as he stretched himself out on his pallet to rest a 
little from the exhausting labors of the day. Prob- 
ably it did not occur to him that his self-imposed 
privations lessened his strength for his work. 

He was thinking of Kuth Leigh. "What a rare 
soul! And yet apparently she did not think or 
care whether she had a soul. What could be the 
spring of her incessant devotion? If ever woman 







went about doing good in an unselfish spirit it 
was she. Yet she confessed her work hopeless. 
She had no faith, no belief in immortality, no ex- 
pectation of any reward, nothing to offer to any- 
body beyond this poor life. Was this the enthusi- 
asm of humanity, of which he heard so much ? 
But she did not seem to have any illusions, or to be 
burned up by enthusiasm. She just kept on. Ah, 
he thought, what a woman she would be if she were 
touched by the fire of faith ! 

Meantime, Euth Leigh went on her round. 
One day was like another, except that every day 
the kaleidoscope of misery showed new combina- 
tions, new phases of suffering and incompetence, 
and there was always a fresh interest in that. For 
years now this had been her life, in the chill of 
winter and the heat of summer, without rest or 
vacation. The amusements, the social duties, the 
allurements of dress and society, that so much 
occupied the thoughts of other women, did not 
seem to come into her life. For books she had 
little time, except the books of her specialty. The 
most exciting novels were pale compared with her 
daily experiences of real life. Almost her only 
recreation was a meeting of the working-girls, a 
session of her labor lodge, or an assembly at the 
Cooper Union, where some fiery orator, perhaps a 
priest, or a clever agitator, a working-man glib of 
speech, who had a mass of statistics at the end of 







his tongue, who read and discussed, in some private 
club of zealots of humanity, metaphysics, psychol- 
ogy, and was familiar with the whole literature of 
labor and socialism, awoke the enthusiasm of the 
discontented or the unemployed, and where men 
and women, in clear but homely speech, told their 
individual experiences of wrong and injustice. 
There was evidence in all these demonstrations 
and organizations that the world was moving, and 
that the old order must change. 

Years and years the little woman had gone on 
with her work, and she frankly confessed to Edith, 
one day when they were together going her rounds, 
that she could see no result from it all. The prob- 
lem of poverty and helplessness and incapacity 
seemed to her more hopeless than when she be- 
gan. There might be a little enlightenment here 
and there, but there was certainly not less misery. 
The state of things was worse than she thought at 
first ; but one thing cheered her : the people were 
better than she thought. They might be dull and 
suspicious in the mass, but she found so much pa- 
tience, unselfishness, so many people of good hearts 
and warm affections. 

" They are the people," she said, i{ I should choose 
for friends. They are natural, unsophisticated. 
And do you know," she went on, " that what most 
surprises me is the number of reading, thoughtful 
people among those who do manual labor. I doubt 





if on your side of town the best books, the real fun- 
damentai and abstruse books, are so read and dis 
cussed, or the philosophy of life is so seriously con 
sidered, as in certain little circles of what you call 
the working-classes." 

" Isn't it all very revolutionary ?" asked Edith. 

"Perhaps," replied the doctor, dryly. "But 
they have no more fads than other people. Their 
theories seem to them not only practical, but they 
try to apply them to actual legislation; at any 
rate, they discriminate in vagaries. You would 
have been amused the other night in a small circle 
at the lamentations over a member he was a car- 
driver who was the authoritative expositor of 
Schopenhauer, because he had gone off into The- 
osophy. It showed such weakness." 

" I have heard that the members of that circle 
were Nihilists." 

" The club has not that name, but probably the 
members would not care to repudiate the title, or 
deny that they were Nihilists theoretically that 
is, if Nihilism means an absolute social and political 
overturning in order that something better may be 
built up. And, indeed, if you see what a hopeless 
tangle our present situation is, where else can the 
mind logically go?" 

" It is pitiful enough," Edith admitted. But all 
this movement you speak of seems to me a vague 
agitation." 







" I don't think," the doctor said, after a moment, 
"that you appreciate the intellectual force that is 
in it all, or allow for the fermenting power in the 
great discontented mass of these radical theories on 
the problem of life." 

This was a specimen of the sort of talk that 
Edith and the doctor often drifted into in their 
mission work. As Ruth Leigh tramped along late 
this afternoon in the slush of the streets, from one 
house of sickness and poverty to another, a sense of 
her puny efforts in this great mass of suffering and 
injustice came over her anew. Her indignation rose 
against the state of things. And Father Damon, 
who was trying to save souls, was he accomplishing 
anything more than she ? Why had he been so curt 
with her when she went to him for help this after- 
noon? Was he just a narrow-minded, bigoted 
priest? A few nights before she had heard him 
speak on the single tax at a labor meeting. She re- 
called his eloquence, his profound sympathy with 
the cause of the people, the thrilling, pathetic 
voice, the illumination of his countenance, the au- 
thority, the consecration in his attitude and dress; 
and he was transfigured to her then, as he was now 
in her thought, into an apostle of humanity. Alas ! 
she thought, what a leader he would be if he would 
break loose from his superstitious traditions I 



CHAPTER VII 

THE acquaintance between the house of Hender- 
son and the house of Delancy was not permitted to 
languish. Jack had his reasons for it, which may 
have been financial, and Carmen had her reasons, 
which were probably purely social. What was the 
good of money if it did not bring social position ? 
and what, on the other hand, was the good of so- 
cial position if you could not use it to get money ? 

In his recent association with the newly rich, 
Jack's twenty thousand a year began to seem 
small. In fact, in the lowering of the rate of inter- 
est and the shrinkage of securities, it was no longer 
twenty thousand a year. This would have been a 
matter of little consequence in the old order. His 
lot was not cast among the poor ; most of his rela- 
tions had solid fortunes, and many of them were 
millionaires, or what was equivalent to that, before 
the term was invented. But they made little dis- 
play ; none at all merely for the purpose of exhibi- 
tion, or to gain or keep social place. In this atmos- 
phere in which he was born Jack floated along 
without effort, with no demand upon him to keep 
up with a rising standard of living. Even impecu- 





niosity, though inconvenient, would not have made 
him lose caste. 

All this was changing now. Since the introduc- 
tion of a new element even the conservative old 
millions had begun to feel the stir of uneasiness, 
and to launch out into extravagance in rivalry with 
the new millions. Even with his relations Jack 
began to feel that he was poor. It did not spur him 
to do anything, to follow the example, for instance, 
of the young fellows from the country, who were 
throwing themselves into Wall Street with the sin- 
gle purpose of becoming suddenly rich, but it made 
him uneasy. And when he was with the Hender- 
sons, or Miss Tavish, whose father, though not 
newly rich, was one of the most aggressive of spec- 
ulators, and saw how easily every luxurious desire 
glided into fulfilment, he felt for the first time in 
his life the motion of envy. It seemed then that 
only unlimited money could make the world attrac- 
tive. Why, even to keep up with the unthinking 
whims of Miss Tavish would bankrupt him in six 
months. That little spread at "Wherry's for the 
theatre party the other night, though he made light 
of it to Edith, was almost the price he couldn't af- 
ford to pay for Storm. He had a grim thought 
that midwinter flowers made dining as expensive 
as dying. Carmen, whom nothing escaped, compli- 
mented him on his taste, quite aware that he 
couldn't afford it, and, apropos, told him of a lady 





in Chicago who, hearing that the fashion had 
changed, wrote on her dinner cards, " No flowers."' 
It was only a matter of course for these people to 
build a new country-house in any spot that fashion 
for the moment indicated, to equip their yachts for 
a Mediterranean voyage or for loitering down the 
Southern coast, to give a ball that was the talk of 
the town, to make up a special train of luxurious 
private cars for Mexico or California. Even at the 
clubs the talk was about these things and the op- 
portunities for getting them. 

There was a rumor about town that Henderson 
was a good deal extended. It alarmed a hundred 
people, not on Henderson's account, but their own. 
When one of them consulted Uncle Jerry, that vet- 
eran smiled. 

"Oh, I guess Henderson's all right. But I 
wouldn't wonder if it meant a squeeze. Of course 
if he's extended, it's an excuse for settling up, and 
the shorts will squeal. I've seen Henderson extend- 
ed a good many times," and the old man laughed. 
" Don't you worry about him." 

This opinion, when reported, did not seem to quiet 
Jack's fears, who saw his own little venture at the 
mercy of a sweeping Street game. It occurred to 
him that he possibly might get a little light on the 
matter by dropping in that afternoon and taking a 
quiet cup of tea with Mrs. Henderson. 

He found her in the library. Out-doors winter 



was slouching into spring with a cold drizzle, with 
a coating of ice on the pavements animating 
weather for the medical profession. Within, there 
was the glow of warmth and color that Carmen 
liked to create for herself. In an entrancing tea- 
gown, she sat by a hickory fire, with a fresh maga- 
zine in one hand and a big paper-cutter in the other. 
She rose at Jack's entrance, and, extending her hand, 
greeted him with a most cordial smile. It was so 
good of him ! She was so lonesome ! He could him- 
self see that the lonesomeness was dissipated, as she 
seated him in a comfortable chair by the fire, and 
then stood a moment looking at him, as if studying 
his comfort. She was such a domestic woman ! 

"You look tired, monsieur," she said, as she 
passed behind his chair and rested the tip of her 
forefinger for a second on his head. " I shall make 
you a cup of tea at once." 

" Not tired, but bothered," said Jack, stretching 
out his legs. 

" I know," she replied ; " it's a bothering world." 
She was still behind him, and spoke low, but with 
sympathy. " I remember, it's only one lump." He 
could feel her presence, so womanly and friendly. 
" I don't care what people say," he was thinking, 
" she's a good-hearted little thing, and understands 
men." He felt that he could tell her anything, al- 
most anything that he could tell a man. She was 
sympathetic and not squeamish. 



" There," she said, handing him the tea and look- 
ing down on him. 

The cup was dainty, the fragrance of the tea de- 
licious, the woman exquisite. 

" I'm better already," said Jack, with a laugh. 

She made a cup for herself, handed him the cig- 
arettes, lit one for herself, and sat on a low stool 
not far from him. 

" Kow what is it ?" 

" Oh, nothing a little business worry. Have 
you heard any Street rumor ?" 

" Eumor ?" she repeated, with a little start. And 
then, leaning forward, " Do you mean that about 
Mr. Henderson in the morning papers ?" 

" Yes." 

Carmen, relieved, gave a liquid little laugh, and 
then said, with a change to earnestness : " I'm go- 
ing to trust you, my friend. Henderson put it in 
himself ! He told me so this morning when I asked 
him about it. This is just between ourselves." 

Jack said " Of course," but he did not look re- 
lieved. The clever creature divined the situation 
without another word, for there was no turn in 
the Street that she was not familiar with. But 
there was no apparent recognition of it, except in 
her sympathetic tone, when she said : " Well, the 
world is full of annoyances. I'm bothered myself 
and such a little thing." 

" What is it ?" 





" Oh nothing, not even a rumor. You cannot 
do anything about it. I don't know why I should 
tell you. But I will." And she paused a moment, 
looking down in an innocent perplexity. "It's 
just this: I am on the Foundlings' Board with 
Mrs. Schuyler Blunt, and I don't know her, and 
you can't think how awkward it is having to meet 
her every week in that stiff kind of way." She 
did not go on to confide to Jack how she had in- 
trigued to get on the board, and how Mrs. Schuy- 
ler Blunt, in the most well-bred manner, had prac- 
tically ignored her. 

" She's an old friend of mine." 
" Indeed ! She's a charming woman." 
" Yes. We were great cronies when she was 
Sadie Mack. She isn't a genius, but she is good- 
hearted. I suppose she is on all the charity boards 
in the city. She patronizes everything," Jack con- 
tinued, with a smile. 

" I'm sure she is," said Carmen, thinking that 
however good-hearted she might be she was very 
"snubby." "And it makes it all the more awk- 
ward, for I am interested in so many things my- 
self." 

" I can arrange all that," Jack said, in an off- 
hand way. Carmen's look of gratitude could hardly 
be distinguished from affection. " That's easy 
enough. We are just as good friends as ever, 
though I fancy she doesn't altogether approve of 



me lately. It's rather nice for a fellow, Mrs. Hen- 
derson, to hare a lot of women keeping him 
straight, isn't it?" asked Jack, in the tone of a 
bad boy. 

" Yes. Between us all we will make a model of
