Now the nature of Faustina's first love was such as to 
make it probable that it would end in some uncommon way. 
There was something fatal in the suddenness with which her 
affection had grown and had upset the balance of her judg 
ment. It is safe to say that not one young girl in a million 
would have behaved as she had done on the night of the 
insurrection in Rome ; not one in a hundred thousand would, 
in her position, have fallen in love with Gouache. 

The position of the professional artist and of the pro 
fessional man of letters in modern European society is ill 
defined. As a man who has been brought up in a palace 
would undoubtedly betray his breeding sooner or later if

transported to live amongst a gang of thieves, so a man who 
has grown to years of discretion in the atmosphere of studios 
or in the queer company from which most literary men have 
sprung, will inevitably, at one time or another, offend the 
susceptibilities of that portion of humanity which calls itself 
society. It is impossible that it should be otherwise. Among 
a set of people whose profession it is to do always, and in 
all things, precisely what their neighbours do, the man who 
makes his living by doing what other people cannot do, must 
always be a marked figure. Look at modern society. It 
cannot toil nor spin ; it can hardly put together ten words 
in a grammatical sequence. But it can clothe itself. The 
man of letters can both toil and write good English, but his 
taste in tailoring frequently leaves much to be desired. If 
he would put himself in the hands of Poole, and hold his 
tongue, he might almost pass for a member of society. But 
he must needs talk, and his speech bewrayeth him for a 
Galilean. There are wits in society, both many and keen, 
who can say something original, cutting and neatly turned, 
upon almost any subject, with an easy superiority which 
makes the hair of the learned man stand erect upon his 
head. The chief characteristic of him who lives by his 
brains is, that he is not only able to talk consecutively upon 
some subjects, but that he actually does so, which, in society, 
is accounted a monstrous crime against manners. Let him 
write what he wants to say, and print it ; society will either 
not understand him at all, or will read his works with a 
dictionary in the secrecy of its own chamber. But if he 
will hold his tongue in public, society will give him a cup 
of tea and treat him almost like a human being for the sake 
of being said to patronise letters. Any one who likes society's 
tea may drink his fill of it in consideration of wearing a good 
coat and keeping his wits to himself, but he will not succeed 
in marrying any of society's sisters, cousins or aunts without 
a severe struggle. 

Anastase Gouache did not quite understand this. He 
sometimes found himself amidst a group of people who were 
freely discussing some person unknown to him. On such 
occasions he held his peace, innocently supposing that his 



ignorance was without any importance whatsoever, among a 
set of men and women with whom not to know every detail 
concerning every one else is to be little better than an out 
cast. 

' Now do tell me all about the Snooks and Montmorency 
divorce,' says Lady Smyth -Tompkins with a sweetly en 
gaging smile, as she holds out her hand. 

' I did not know there was such a case I don't know the 
people,' you answer. 

' Oh ! I thought, of course, you knew all about it,' Lady 
Smyth-Tompkins replies, and her features turn to stone as 
she realises that you do not know everybody, and leaves you 
to your own reflections. 

Thackeray, snobissme maxime ! How well you knew 
them! 

There are no snobs among the Latin races, but there is a 
worse animal, the sycophant, descended directly from the 
dinner-tables of ancient Rome. In old-fashioned houses there 
are often several of them, headed invariably by the ' giornale 
ambulante,' the walking newspaper, whose business it is to 
pick up items of news during the day in order to detail them 
to the family in the evening. There is a certain old princess 
who sits every evening with her needlework at the head of a 
long table in the dismal drawing-room of a gigantic palace. 
On each side of the board are seated the old parasites, the 
family doctor, the family chaplain, the family lawyer, the 
family librarian, the peripatetic news-sheet and the rest. 

' I have been out to-day,' says her excellency. 

' Oh ! Ah ! Dear me ! In this weather !' Hear what 
the princess says ! The princess has been out ! ' The chorus 
comes up the table, all the answers reaching her ears at 
once. 

' And I saw, as I drove by, the new monument ! What 
a ridiculous thing it is.' 

'Ho! ho ! ho ! Hah ! hah ! hah ! Dear me ! What a 
monument ! What fine taste the princess has ! Hear what 
the princess thinks of the monument ! ' 

' If you will believe it, the bronze horse has a crooked 
leg.' 



'He! he! he! Hi! hi! hi! Dear me ! A crooked leg ! 
How the princess understands horses ! The princess saw 
that he had a crooked leg ! ' 

And so on, for a couple of hours, in the cold, dimly-lighted 
room until her excellency has had enough of it and rises to 
go to bed, when the parasites all scuttle away and quarrel 
with each other in the street as they walk home. Night 
after night, to decades of years, the old lady recounts the 
little journal of her day to the admiring listeners, whose 
chorus of approval is performed daily with the same unvary 
ing regularity. The times are changing now ; the prince is 
not so easily amused, and the sycophant has accordingly 
acquired the art of amusing, but there still survive some 
wonderful monuments of the old school. 

Anastase Gouache was a man of great talent and of rising 
fame, but like other men of his stamp he preferred to believe 
that he was received on a friendly footing for his own sake 
rather than on account of his reputation. In his own eyes, 
he was, as a man, as good as those with whom he associated, 
and had as much right to make love to Faustina Montevarchi 
as the young Frangipani, for whom her father destined her. 
Faustina, on her part, was too young to appreciate the real 
strength of the prejudices by which she was surrounded. 
She could not understand that, although the man she loved 
was a gentleman, young, good-looking, successful, and not 
without prospects of acquiring a fortune, he was yet wholly 
ineligible as a husband. Had she seen this ever so clearly 
it might have made but very little difference in her feelings ; 
but she did not see it, and the disparaging remarks about 
Anastase, which she occasionally heard in her own family, 
seemed to her utterly unjust as well as quite unfounded. 
The result was that the two young people were preparing for 
themselves one of those terrible disappointments of which 
the consequences are sometimes felt during a score of years. 
Both, however, were too much in love to bear suspense very 
long without doing something to precipitate the course of 
events, and whenever they had the chance they talked the 
matter over and built wonderful castles in the air. 

About a fortnight after the marriage of San Giacinto 



they were seated together in a room full of people, late in 
the afternoon. They had been talking for some time upon 
indifferent subjects. When two persons meet, who are very 
much in love with each other, and waste their time in dis 
cussing topics of little importance, it may be safely predicted 
that something unusual is about to occur. 

' I cannot endure this suspense any longer,' said Gouache 
at last. 

' Nor I,' answered Faustina. 

' It is of no use to wait any more. Either your father 
will consent or he will not. I will ask him and know the 
worst.' 

' And if it is the worst what then ? ' The young girl 
turned her eyes towards Anastase with a frightened look. 

' Then we must manage without his consent.' 
' How is that possible ? ' 

' It must be possible,' replied Gouache. ' If you love me 
it shall be possible. It is only a question of a little courage 
and goodwill But, after all, your father may consent 
Why should he not ? ' 

' Because ' she hesitated a little. 

' Because I am not a Roman prince, you mean.' Anastase 
glanced quickly at her. 

' No. He wants me to marry Frangipani.' 

' Why did you never tell me that ? ' 

' I did not know it when we last met. My mother told 
me of it last night.' 

" Is the match settled ? ' asked Gouache. He was very 
pale. 

' I think it has been spoken of,' answered Faustina in a 
low voice. She shivered a little and pressed her hands 
together. There was a short silence, during which Anas 
tase did not take his eyes from her, while she looked down, 
avoiding his look. 

' Then there is no time to be lost,' said Gouache at last. 
'I will go to your father to-morrow morning.' 

' Oh don't, don't ! ' cried Faustina, suddenly, with an 
expression of intense anxiety. 

' Why not ? ' The artist seemed very much surprised 





' You do not know him ! You do not know what he will 
say to you ! You will be angry and will lose your temper 
he will be cruel and will insult you, and you will resent 
it then I shall never see you again. You do not know ' 

' This is something new,' said Gouache. ' How can you 
be sure that he will receive me so badly ? Have your people 
talked about me  ? After all, I am an honest man, and 
though I live by my profession I am not poor. It is true, 
I am not such a match for you as Frangipani. Tell me, do 
they abuse me at your house ? ' 

'No what can they say, except that you are an artist  ? 
That is not abuse, nor calumny.' 

' It depends upon how it is said. I suppose it is San 
Giacinto who says it.' Gouache's face darkened. 

' San Giacinto has guessed the truth,' answered Faustina, 
shaking her head. ' He knows that we love each other, and 
just now he is very powerful with my father. It will be 
worse if he wins the suit and is Prince Saracinesca.' 

' Then that is another reason for acting at once. Faus 
tina you followed me once will you not go with me, 
away, out of this cursed city ? I will ask for you first. I 
will behave honourably. But if he will not consent, what 
is there left for us to do ? Can we live apart ? Can you 
marry Frangipani ? Have not many people done before 
what we think of doing ? Is it wrong ? Heaven knows, 
I make no pretence to sanctity. But I would not have you 
do anything what shall I say? Anything against your 
conscience.' There was a shade of bitterness in the laugh 
that accompanied the last words. 

'You do not know what things he will say,' repeated 
Faustina, in despairing tones. 

' This is absurd,' said Gouache. ' I can bear anything he 
can say well enough. He is an old man and I am a young 
one, and have no intention of taking offence. He may say 
what he pleases, call me a villain, a brigand- that is your 
favourite Italian expression a thief, a liar, anything he 
pleases. I will not be angry. There shall be no violence. 
But I cannot endure this state of things any longer. I must 
try my luck.' 




' Wait a little longer,' answered Faustina, in an imploring 
tone. 'Wait until the suit is decided.' 

'In order to let San Giacinto get even more influence 
than he has now ? It would be a mistake you almost said 
so yourself a moment ago. Besides, the suit may last for 
years.' 

' It will not last a fortnight.' 

' Poor Sant' Ilario ! ' exclaimed Gouache. ' Does every 
body know about it ? ' 

' I suppose so. But nobody speaks of it. We all feel 
dreadfully about it, except my father and San Giacinto and 
Flavia.' 

' If he is in a good humour, this is the very time to go to 
him.' 

' Please, please do not insist ! ' Faustina was evidently 
very much in earnest. With the instinct of a very young 
woman, she clung to the half happiness of the present which 
was so much greater than anything she had known before 
in her life. But Gouache would not be satisfied. 

' I must know the worst,' he said again, as they parted. 

' But this is so much better than the worst,' answered 
Faustina, sadly. 

' Who risks nothing, wins nothing,' retorted the young 
man with a bright smile. 

In spite of his hopefulness, however, he had received a 
severe shock on hearing the news of the intended match with 
young Frangipani. He had certainly never expected to find 
himself the rival of such a suitor, and his sense of possibility, 
if man may be said to possess such a faculty, was staggered 
by the idea. He suddenly awakened to a true understand 
ing of his position in Roman society, and when he contem 
plated his discovery in all its bearings, his nerve almost 
forsook him. When he remembered his childhood, his 
youth, and the circumstances in which he had lived up to a 
recent time, he found it hard to realise that he was trying to 
marry such a girl, in spite of her family and in opposition 
to such a man as was now brought forward as a match for 
her. It was not in his nature, however, to be discouraged in 
the face of difficulties. He was like a brave man who has 





received a stunning blow, but who continues to fight until he 
has gradually regained his position. Gouache could no more 
have relinquished Faustina than he could have abandoned 
a half-finished picture in which he believed, any more than 
he had given up the attempt to break away the stones at 
the Yigna Santucci after he had received the bullet in his 
shoulder. He had acquired his position in life by indomi 
table perseverance and hopefulness, and those qualities 
would not now fail him, in one of the most critical situations 
through which he had ever passed. In spite of Faustina's 
warning and, to some extent, in spite of his own better judg 
ment, he determined to face the old prince at once and to ask 
him boldly for his daughter. 

He had spoken confidently to Faustina of being married 
against the will of her father, but when he thought over this 
alternative he recollected a fact he had almost completely 
forgotten in considering his matrimonial projects. He was 
a soldier and had enlisted in the Zouaves for a term of 
years. It was true that by using the influence he possessed 
he might hope to be released from his engagement, but such 
a course was most repugnant to him. Before Mentana it 
would have been wholly impossible, for it would have seemed 
cowardly. Now that he had distinguished himself and had 
been wounded in the cause, the thing might be done without 
dishonour, but it would involve a species of self-abasement 
to which he was not prepared to submit. On the other 
hand, to wait until his term of service should have expired 
was to risk losing Faustina altogether. He knew that she 
loved him, but he was experienced enough to know that a 
young girl is not always able to bear the pressure exercised 
upon her when marriage is concerned. In Eome, and 
especially at that time, it was in the power of parents to use 
the most despotic means for subduing the will of their 
children. There was even a law by which a disobedient 
son or daughter could be imprisoned for a considerable 
length of time, provided that the father could prove that his 
child had rebelled against his just will. Though Gouache 
was not aware of this, the fact that a similar institution 
existed in his own country made him suspect that it was to 



xviii

be found in Borne also. Supposing that Montevarchi re 
fused to accept him for a son-in-law, and that Faustina, on 
the other hand, refused to marry young Frangipani, it was 
only too probable that she might be locked up in a luxuri 
ously furnished cell of course to reflect upon the error of 
her ways. It was by no means certain that in the face of 
such humiliation and suffering Faustina would continue her 
resistance ; indeed, she could hardly be blamed if she yielded 
in the end. Gouache believed in the sincerity of her love 
because the case was his own ; had he heard of it in the life 
of another man he would have laughed at the idea that a girl 
of eighteen could be capable of a serious passion. 

It is not necessary, however, to enter into an analysis of 
the motives and feelings of either Faustina or Anastase. 
Their connection with the history of the Saracinesca arose 
from what they did, and not from the thoughts which 
prompted their actions. It is sufficient to say that Gouache 
conceived the mad idea of asking Montevarchi's consent to 
his marriage and to explain the immediate consequences of 
the step he took. 

Matters were rapidly approaching a climax. San Gia- 
cinto had seen the lawyers at Frascati, and he had brought 
his wife back to Rome very soon in order to be on the spot 
while the case was being prepared. The men of the law 
declared that the matter was a very simple one and that no 
court could withhold its decision a single day after seeing 
the documents which constituted the claim. The only point 
about which any argument could arise related to the identity 
of San Giacinto himself, and no difficulty was found in 
establishing substantial proof that he was Giovanni Sara 
cinesca and not an impostor. His father and grandfather 
had jealously kept all the records of themselves which were 
necessary, from the marriage certificate of the original Don 
Leone, who had signed the deed, to the register of San Gia- 
cinto's own birth. Copies were obtained, properly drawn up 
and certified, of the parish books and of the few government 
documents which were officially preserved in the kingdom of 
Naples before 1860, and the lawyers declared themselves 
ready to open the case. Up to this time the strictest 



 

secrecy was preserved, at the request of San Giacinto himself, 
He said that in such an important matter he wished nothing 
to transpire until he was ready to act ; more especially as 
the Saracinesca themselves could not he ignorant of the true 
state of the case and had no right to receive notice of the 
action "beforehand. As Corona had foreseen, San Giacinto 
intended to ohtain the decision hy means of a perfectly legal 
trial, and was honestly ready to court enquiry into the rights 
he was ahout to assert. When the moment came and all 
was ready, he went to the Palazzo Saracinesca and asked for 
the prince, who received him in the same room in which the 
two had met when the ex-innkeeper had made his appear 
ance in Rome nearly three months earlier. As San Giacinto 
entered he felt that he had not wasted his time during that 
short interval. 

'I have come to' talk with you upon a business which 
must be unpleasant to you,' he began. l Unfortunately it 
cannot be avoided. I beg you to believe that it is my wish 
to act loyally and fairly.' 

'I hope so,' said Saiacinesca, bending his bushy gray 
eyebrows and fixing his keen old eyes upon his visitor. 

'You need not doubt it,' replied San Giacinto rather 
proudly. ' You are doubtless acquainted with the nature of 
the deed by which our great-grandfathers agreed to transfer the 
titles and property to the younger of the two. When we 
first spoke of the matter I was not aware of the existence of 
a saving clause. I cannot suppose you ignorant of it. 
That clause provided that if Leone Saracinesca married and 
had a lawful heir, the deed should be null and void. He 
did marry, as you know. I am his direct descendant, and 
have children of my own by my first marriage. I cannot 
therefore allow the clause in question to remain in abeyance 
any longer. With all due respect to you, I am obliged to 
tell you quite frankly that, in law, I am Prince Saracinesca.' 

Having thus stated his position as plainly as possible, 
San Giacinto folded his great hands upon his knee and 
leaned against the back of his chair. Saracinesca looked as 
though he were about to make some hasty answer, but he con 
trolled his intention and rose to his feet. After walking 






twice np and down the room, he came and stood in front ol 
his cousin. 

' Let us be plain in what we say,' he began. ' I give you 
my word that, until Montevarchi sent back those papers the 
other day, I did not know what they contained. I had not 
read them for thirty years, and at that time the clause 
escaped me. I do not remember to have noticed it. This 
may have been due to the fact that I had never heard that 
Leone had any living descendants, and should therefore 
have attached no importance to the words if I had seen 
them.' 

' I believe you,' said San Giacinto, calmly. The old man's 
eyes flashed. 

' I always take it for granted that I am believed,' he an 
swered. ' Will you give me your word that you are what 
you assert yourself to be, Giovanni Saracinesca, the great- 
grandson and lawful heir of Leone ? ' 

' Certainly. I pledge my honour that I am ; and I, too, 
expect to be believed by you.' 

There was something in the tone of the answer that 
struck a sympathetic cord in Saracinesca's nature. San 
Giacinto had risen to his feet, and there was something in 
the huge, lean strength of him, in the bold look of his eyes, 
in the ring of his deep voice, that inspired respect. Rough 
he was, and not over refined or carefully trained in the ways 
of the world, cruel perhaps, and overbearing too ; but he was 
every inch a Saracinesca, and the old man felt it. 

' I believe you,' answered the prince. ' You may take 
possession when you please. I am Don Leone, and you are 
the head of the house.' 

He made a gesture full of dignity, as though resigning 
then and there his name and the house in which he lived, 
to him who was lawfully entitled to both. The action was 
magnificent and worthy of the man. There was a superb 
disregard of consequences in his readiness to give up every 
thing rather than keep for a moment what was not his, which 
affected San Giacinto strangely. In justice to the latter it 
must be remembered that he had not the faintest idea that 
he was the instrument of a pipantic fraud from which he 








was to derive the chief advantage. He instinctively bowed 
in acknowledgment of his cousin's generous conduct. 

' I shall not take advantage of your magnanimity,' he said, 
' until the law has sanctioned my doing so.' 

' As you please,' answered the other. ' I have nothing to 
conceal from the law, but I am prejudiced against lawyers. 
Do as you think best. A family council can settle the 
matter as well as the courts.' 

' Your confidence in me is generous and noble. I prefer, 
however, that the tribunal should examine the matter.' 

' As you please,' repeated Saracinesca. There was no 
reason for prolonging an interview which could not be 
agreeable to either party. The old man remained standing. 
' No opposition will be made to the suit,' he said. ' You 
will simply produce your papers in proper form, and I will 
declare myself satisfied.' He held out his hand. 

' I trust you will bear me no ill-will,' said San Giacinto 
rather awkwardly. 

' For taking what is yours and not mine ? Not in the 
least. Good-evening.' 

San Giacinto left the room. When he was gone, Sara 
cinesca stood still for a moment, and then sank into a chair. 
His strong nature had sustained him through the meeting 
and would sustain him to the end, but he was terribly shaken, 
and felt a strange sensation of numbness in the back of his 
head, which was quite new to him. For some minutes he 
sat still as though dazed and only half conscious. Then he 
rose again, shook himself as though to get rid of a bad dream 
and rang the bell. He sent for Giovanni, who appeared 
immediately. 

' San Giacinto has been here,' he said quickly. ' He is 
the man. You had better tell your wife, as she will want 
to collect her things before we leave the house.' 

Giovanni was staggered by his father's impetuosity. He 
had realised that the danger existed, but it had always seemed 
indefinitely far removed, 

' I suppose there will be some legal proceedings before 
everything is settled,' he said with more calmness than he 
felt. 



' What is that to us ? We must go, sooner or later.' 
' And if the courts do not decide in his favour, what then ? ' 
' There is no doubt about it,' answered the prince, pacing 
the room as his excitement returned. 'You and I are 
nobody. We had better go and live in an inn. That man 
is honest. I hate him, but he is honest. Why do you 
stand there staring at me ? Were you not the first to say 
that if we are impostors we should give up everything of our 
own free-will? And now you seem to think that I will 
fight the suit ! That is your logic ! That is all the con 
sistency you have acquired in your travels ! Go and tell 
your wife that you are nobody, that I am nobody ! Go and 
tell her to give you a title, a name for men to call you by ! 
Go into the market and see whether you can find a name 
for your father ! Go and hire a house for us to live in, 
when that Neapolitan devil has brought Flavia Montevarchi 
to live in the palace where your mother died, where you 
were born poor Giovanni ? Not that I pity you any more 
than I pity myself Why should I ? You are young and
