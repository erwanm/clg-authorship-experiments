that can come. Those who discover that 
affection reposed has been given to an illu- 
sory representation, to a trickster that has 
cheated the heart, sound a deeper depth of 
grief, one where not only despair is, but 
stupor too. They may mourn, indeed, 
but they mourn for themselves, and they 
mourn alone. 

On the night to which Mrs. Smithwick 
had referred, that crack of doom which is 
to herald an eternal silence could not have 
more appalled the girl than the spectacle 
which her father's room disclosed. It had 
seemed to her then that she was insane, that 
the world was ; that, she was promenading 
consciously through a nightmare from which, 
despite the effort, she could not awake. So 
great was the tension that it may be in the 
strain her mind would have given way, had 
not oblivion thrown its pall and drawn her 
gently in its morphic arms. 

That night a fever came that was oblit- 
erating as the morrow of steps on the sand. 
For a month she was delirious. When she 




issued from it, though the unforgettable re- 
mained, she was still in ignorance of much 
that had occurred, and it was not until she 
was able to leave her room that it was con- 
sidered wise for her to learn a few fragments 
and particles of the truth. For the truth in 
its entirety was yet veiled and obscure. 

Physicians certified that Mr. Attersol had 
died of heart failure, though whether that 
heart failure had been induced by the ad- 
vent of the burglar whose presence Bancroft 
had detected, or whether death had preceded 
that invasion, they were unable to decide. 
But physicians are not detectives ; they are 
content to be executioners. A gentleman 
from headquarters came, examined the 
window and the lawn, catechised the serv- 
ants and departed with a fee. At Paw- 
tucket the local police locked up a stranger, 
releasing him only on the discovery that on 
the night in question the stranger, if criminally occupied, had been so with the local 
policeman's wife. 

But the press was more enterprising. The 





Chronicle published a composite portrait 
which it labelled Arthur Bancroft, declaring 
that the stab received had, for reasons which 
presently would be given in full, been dealt 
by a lady of the house. The reporter detailed by the Dispatch worked up such wonderful hypotheses that the city editor, fore- 
seeing the moment when he would denounce 
himself as the culprit, wired him back to 
town. The Herald, too, was well in the 
movement; and the Recorder scored a beat 
by giving in colors a plan of Mr. Astor's 
conservatory and declaring that to be the 
scene of the crime. 

There were other things, however, which 
supervening interested the public more, and 
gradually the Attersol mystery, though un- 
elucidated, was practically forgot. 

But to Myrrha it was as though the hor- 
ror of that night would never go. In one 
brief minute it had robbed her of her lover, 
of her father, and of that trust which certain 
natures have in the validity of intuitions. 
For to her, in her inexperience, Quain had 





seemed, not perfection indeed, but the em- 
bodiment of attributes which transcend it, 
which appeal to the senses as perfection 
never does. She had not regarded him as 
the ideal, as one unsulliable and mailed 
in right ; but he had had the power to 
touch the very well-springs of her being, 
so adroitly, too, that, despite her father's 
unconcealed alarm, despite the threat of 
disinheritance, despite the prayers which he 
addressed her, despite the evidence which 
he had displayed of the man's unworthiness, 
so unable was she to fancy him other than 
loyal and true, that, like Dona Sol, she would 
have preferred misery with him to regalias 
with an emperor. 

Erring, yes. She told herself he might be 
that ; but she told herself, too, that though 
a man may err and err again, he may yet 
remain noble and steadfast through it all. 
And she knew, unprompted, that what would 
appear a crime in the eyes of her father 
might seem but a transgression to another 
less sewere. 





To his threats, therefore, she had been 
indifferent, to his pleadings deaf, and when, 
in his increasing alarm, he had come to her 
with proofs of her lover's folly, of his debts, 
drunkenness, and disorders, she had thought 
him none the less lovable for that. Be- 
sides, she had argued with herself, and not 
without logic, were he otherwise he would 
be different, and it was he as he was whom 
she loved. She had found excuses, too, as 
young girls will. He was homeless, without 
occupation ; brought up in luxury, abruptly 
he was relegated to the cheerlessness of 
furnished rooms. It was small wonder that 
he should seek distraction ; and if he found 
that distraction in ways of which her father 
could not approve, those ways she at least 
could condone. It was all very well for her 
father to denounce him, to say that he ran 
up debts, that he gambled, and the like. 
Dissipation, so far as she could see, held no 
temptations for men of her father's years 
and habits ; and as for debts, if inexcusable 
in the rich, were they not often unavoidable 





by the poor ? Had Oswald money, she was 
quite sure he would owe no one a penny ; 
had he an occupation, he would not gam- 
ble ; and had he a home, he would seek no 
distraction abroad. 

It was in this fashion that the girl had 
reasoned with herself ; but this was after 
she had ceased reasoning with her heart, for 
that would brook no interference. When it 
had first begun to beat, she found that she 
must yield to it or break it ; and for that 
she lacked the strength. The love that had 
entered there had come very suddenly, but 
it had entered as a knight may into that 
domain where all is vassalage and his own. 
It had frightened her at first, though why 
she could not tell. But presently the fear 
had gone, aided, perhaps, in its disappearance, by the opposition with^which the love 
itself had been met. In this she may have 
differed from young ladies of fiction, but 
she differed not at all from the average girl. 
It was not that she did not love her father, 
that she did not respect him, or even that 





she was unwilling to obey. But with the 
affection, the respect, and the obedience 
which he exacted, and which she gave, she 
felt that her duty ended. She would not 
marry in the face of his inhibition, she 
would do nothing that was clandestine, nor 
would she be a party to anything that was 
underhand. But her heart was her own to 
bestow or to retain, and no one should be 
suffered to coerce or dictate to it. 

Such had been her feelings ; but on that 
ever memorable night, roused from sleep by 
her father's summons, terror-stricken by the 
sudden uproar that filled the hall, none the 
less affrighted by the silence which ensued, 
when at last she found the strength to get 
to that broken door and look within, the 
horror of the spectacle her father dead, 
Bancroft senseless, and her lover, knife in 
hand, his feet unshod, his features convulsed 
if hearts do break, it seemed that hers 
must then. 

It was then May, but not until summer 
had gone and autumn had begun to use its 






palette on the leaves, did she learn with 
partial exactness the motive of it all. 

Bancroft, strong in blood and sinew, had 
been up and doing before the delirium had 
left her, and when at last she had been able 
to descend to the sitting-room again, he 
lacked the brutality to reconstruct for her 
what he knew of the episodes of that night. 
But he was very tender of her, yet tender 
with just that self-effacement which the 
broken-hearted appreciate most. 

The bandage which the Greeks gave to 
Eros must have fallen long since and been 
lost on the way. Nowadays a girl does not 
need to be told that she is loved ; she possesses a clairvoyance which does away with 
any need of speech. But Myrrha was quite 
blind. She noticed the tenderness and was 
grateful. As for love, that she deemed 
impossible. She was degraded in her own 
eyes, a thing forever vile, one who had given 
her love and lips to an outlaw. There were 
no waters in which she could cleanse the 
pollution. Of her own choosing she had 





gone forth an exile from the best. She had 
ceased to be worthy of an honest man. 

Bancroft's self-effacement, however, was 
not motived by any such reasoning as that. 
It was due primarily to the girl's manifest 
weakness, and in an almost equal degree to 
the fact that she was one of the notable heiresses of the world, one to whom the great 
of the earth would offer the hand not the 
left either, but both, and on supplicating 
knees at that. Yet he knew, too, the sim- 
plicity of her nature, the sweetness of her 
ways ; and he told himself that could he but 
win her and hold her to him, the wealth 
which she possessed she might toss to the 
sea. 

But with the heiress there is this diffi- 
culty. A man less opulent than herself, 
however sincere "his love may be, is handi- 
capped always by the throttling dread that 
she will think it is less herself he is seeking 
than the blue eyes of her cheque-book. . 

As a consequence, Bancroft possessed 
himself of patience. During the summer 





and the isolation which the recent tragedy 
demanded, he made himself discreetly and 
unimportunately a slave. Later, when on 
the girl's face, on the lobes of her ears and 
on the cleft of her chin, health had replaced 
its tokens in pink, the slave disappeared and 
the adviser came, one not self-constituted 
either, a guardian appointed by power of 
court, as such a trifle authoritative, given to 
the giving of orders, commands as well, and 
injunctions too. 

But the girl was very pliant, never un- 
ruly ; she signed unread what papers he 
brought her, indifferent to details, confident 
in his wisdom, secure in her trust. 

Meanwhile, apart from an unoccupied seat 
at table, domestic arrangements were un- 
changed. Of a Saturday, Bancroft in his 
quality of nearest friend, of attorney and 
administrator, would appear. On Monday 
he was gone. Toward the end of the week 
Mrs. Smithwick might seem a trifle de- 
pressed, as a bird will in moulting season, 
but early in the next her spirits would 





revive. The death of her brother-in-law 
and the attendant episodes had indeed been a 
shock one, so to speak, which had flattened 
her out but her nature possessed all the 
elasticity of a rubber ball ; she rebounded 
at once, voluble in grief, fanatic at worship, 
receiving counsel from clergy, comfort from 
milliners, diversion from dentists, repose- 
less, gossipy, delighting always in lessening 
and accentuating her mourning with cas- 
cades of jet and fantasies in crepe. 

It was Bancroft's periodic return that 
alone had power to depress her. She re- 
garded him as a Poke, a word which she 
could not have defined had she tried, but 
which suggested to her all the attributes 
which she disliked the most. He was not 
prompt with a chair ; when she unrolled her 
little spangle of resonant names he dis- 
played no interest in face or look. Such 
things affect a woman, they ruffle her 
flounces and belittle her in her own esteem. 
As a consequence, she disliked him. Then, 
too, he was an attorney. A barrister passe 





encore but an attorney ! Why, in England 
an attorney was but a degree above a varlet 
a bit of sociological information which 
she imparted to the housekeeper, who re- 
ceived it with awe. 

But there were minor matters. In spite 
of her Mightiness there was much of the she- 
wolf about her. Myrrha was less a daughter 
of her sister's than a child of her own. And 
she wanted to growl over her and show her 
false teeth at the trapper that was coming 
that way. The bare possibility that her 
charge was welcoming that trapper, that 
she was preparing to put her little paw in 
his, was a thing so distressing that it de- 
manded intervention from above. For Mrs. 
Smithwick believed in such interventions, 
doctrinally, in the exact measure that Pres- 
byterianism authorized her to believe, and 
would have believed anyway, authorized or 
not, because she regarded it as aristocratic 
to do so. 

But the intervention demanded remained 
unvouchsafed. " I can feel her going," she 





confided to the housekeeper a confidence 
which the housekeeper received with respect. 

But Myrrha was not " going." She 
lacked even the urging which usually pre- 
cedes such departure. Bancroft had not 
said a word which he might not have 
shrieked after her in a ball-room. Only 
his forethought increased ; the girl felt herself surrounded by impalpable attentions, 
her mind wadded from care. He was growing necessary to her, and one evening that 
fact became patent to them both. 

It was on the veranda. Above, a gala 
moon glowed in a sky of peacock blue. 
From beyond came the sibilants of the 
sea. But in the air, though there was a 
fragrance, there was a chill as well. 

Bancroft, touched by that chill, went for 
a mantle which he put about her, and then 
as she stood, the moon in her eyes, stepped 
back. 

" Do you know, you are prettier than 
ever." But at once, as though in palliation, 
he added : " You have been so pale." 





" Don't call me pretty, or you will make 
me regret that I am not. If you wish to 
pay me a compliment, call yourself my 
friend." 

" You know that I am and more." 

" I know I wish I had a brother." As 
she spoke she turned and seated herself 
in a great wicker fauteuil. " I think I have 
always wished one." 

Bancroft shook his head. " It is not in 
that way I love you. For I do love you. 
I always have, I always shall." 

The girl's brow and mouth had contracted 
a little ; but as she said nothing, either in 
encouragement or rebuke, after a moment 
he leaned over and took her hand. 

" Will you give it to me, Myrrha ? " 

She drew back, but irresolutely it seemed, 
slowly, as with regret. 

" Will you not ? " he repeated. He had 
made no effort at detention, but he bent a 
little closer. In her eyes there were tears. 
With the hand which he had released she 
brushed them away. 





" Will you not ? " 

But other tears had come. He no longer 
saw, he heard them. They fell swiftly, one 
after another, like the ripple of the rain. 
Memory, something keener perhaps, had 
claimed her as its own. 

" I can't," she sobbed at last. 

" But why ? I am not " 

She interrupted him. " I gave it once. I 
am a widow yet without a widow's weeds. 
Don't ask me. I am ashamed of myself, 
ashamed of my widowhood." 

" Myrrha, Myrrha ! How is it possible 
for you to be so insane? The man never 
cared for you " 

He hesitated. A great temptation beset 
him to inform her of the truth, to tell her 
who in reality was the man she thought she 
had loved, to extirpate forever any senti- 
ment she might retain. Should he, had he 
the right ? But hesitation has its perils. 
Before he could decide, her thought had 
veered. 

"Tell me" 





He was looking still into her eyes. The 
tears had gone now, but there had come a 
wistfulness and a melancholy which made 
them sadder yet. 

" Tell me ; where is he ? " 

Bancroft started. " Don't you know? 
Has no one told you ? Didn't your aunt ? 
Surely" 

But the girl shook her head. " At first I 
would not let her. Since then I have been 
afraid to ask. I feared that perhaps he 
might be in in " 

" He is dead." 

The monosyllables fell like stones, and she 
held out both hands as though to protect 
herself from them. The gesture annoyed 
him. 

" But what ? He cheated the gallows, 
that is all." 

" Don't," the girl cried, for his words 
were as blows ; " don't ! " 

And with the hands that she had ex- 
tended she cowered her face. 

" But, Myrrha, don't you know that he 





killed your father ? I had left him but a 
few minutes before. If not in the best of 
health, at least he was not ill. He wanted 
to see you. I went to tell your women. 
When I returned the door that had been 
open was locked. I tried it,, there was no 
answer. I knocked again ; then I got a 
chair, looked through the transom, and 
there was that man robbing the safe. The 
very cheques which he had forged and 
which he took; from it were found with other 
things of his on the ship." 

"What ship?" 

" The ship from which he threw himself. 
Though, even otherwise, even had he not 
committed suicide, I think I should have 
said nothing " 

Again the temptation to tell her beset 
him, but before he could formulate the 
words Myrrha had risen. 

" I don't see why," she murmured. Then, 
woman-like, she showed her teeth : " I 
always knew you hated him." 

And with a little princess air which she 





could assume very well when she chose, 
she stood up and turned away. 

Bancroft turned, too. A moment before 
he might have told ; now the telling seemed 
unfair, the adwantage too great. But, aside 
from himself, was not a knowledge of her 
relationship to Quain needful, one which it 
was his duty to impart, which would cause 
pain, as acute, too, as any surgeon could 
inflict, but one which would rid her forever 
of the poison she had breathed, of the gan- 
grene of regret as well ? No doubt it would 
be his duty were he other than himself, and 
yet again, would it ? 

Her father had not told, and might not 
even have contemplated doing so, were it 
not for the stress of circumstances in which 
at the time both labored. But since then 
the incentive had gone ; the man was dead. 
Besides, Myrrha had at least seen him as 
he was, and, time aiding, doubtless she 
would forget. Yet would she ? 

As he reflected, the dilemma heightened. 
It was a case of conscience, one which he 





might have decided one way or the other, 
had he been able to eliminate himself ; but 
such elimination being impossible, he could 
only console himself with the knowledge 
of Quain's decease, and elect for the moment to hold his tongue. Then, too, he had 
been brutal enough already. 

Myrrha had moved a little and stood 
looking out beyond the horizon into a sky 
perhaps which only she could see. 

In a moment he was at her side. 

"Will you forgive me?" 

She turned to him, a strange glad look in 
her eyes. " It is your turn now ; forgive me." 

And as he answered nothing, feigning 
perplexity as to anything she could do for 
which forgiveness should be requisite, the 
strangeness and gladness in her eyes 
diffused as the dawn diffuses, till all the 
beauty of her face was aglow. 

" I have had a cruel dream, one that pro- 
longed itself so I thought I never should 
awake. But it is going. Indeed, it is gone. 
Help me to banish all memory of it, won't
