with that curious, that fascinating accent of the 
Languedoc, which appears to abound in final con 
sonants, and leads the Toulousains to say bien-g and 
maison-g, like Englishmen learning French. It is as 
if they talked with their teeth rather than with their 
tongue. I find in my note-book a phrase in regard to 
Toulouse which is perhaps a little ill-natured, but 
which I will transcribe as it stands: "The oddity is 
that the place should be both animated and dull. A 
big, brown-skinned population, clattering about in a 
flat, tortuous town, which produces nothing whatever 
that I can discover. Except the church of Saint- 
Sernin and the fine old court of the Hotel d Assezat, 
Toulouse has no architecture; the houses are for the 
most part of brick, of a grayish-red color, and have no 
particular style. The brick- work of the place is in fact 



very poor, inferior to that of the north Italian towns, 
and quite wanting in the richness of tone which this 
homely material takes on in the damp climates of the 
north." And then my note-book goes on to narrate a 
little visit to the Capitol, which was soon made, as the 
building was in course of repair and half the rooms 
were closed. 



XX. 

THE history of Toulouse is detestable, saturated 
with blood and perfidy; and the ancient custom of 
the Floral Games, grafted upon all sorts of internecine 
traditions, seems, with its false pastoralism, its mock 
chivalry, its display of fine feelings, to set off rather 
than to mitigate these horrors. The society was 
founded in the fourteenth century, and it has held 
annual meetings ever since, meetings at which poems 
in the fine old langue d*oc are declaimed and a 
blushing laureate is chosen. This business takes place 
in the Capitol, before the chief magistrate of the town, 
who is known as the capitoul, and of all the pretty 
women as well, a class very numerous at Toulouse. 
It was impossible to have a finer person than that of 
the portress who pretended to show me the apart 
ments in which the Floral Games are held; a big, 
brown, expansive woman, still in the prime of life, 
with a speaking eye, an extraordinary assurance, and 
a pair of magenta stockings, which were inserted into 



  

the neatest and most polished little black sabots, 
and which, as she clattered up the stairs before me, 
lavishly displaying them, made her look like the 
heroine of an opera-louffe. Her talk was all in s, 
g s, and d s, and in mute * 's strongly accented, as 
autrt, the dire, splendide, the last being an epithet 
she applied to everything the Capitol contained, and 
especially to a horrible picture representing the famous 
Clemence Isaure, the reputed foundress of the poetical 
contest, presiding on one of these occasions. I won 
dered whether Clemence Isaure had been anything 
like this terrible Toulousaine of to-day, who would 
have been a capital figure-head for a floral game. 
The lady in whose honor the picture I have just men 
tioned was painted is a somewhat mythical personage, 
and she is not to be found in the "Biographic Uni- 
verselle." She is, however, a very graceful myth; and 
if she never existed, her statue does, at least, a 
shapeless effigy, transferred to the Capitol from the 
so-called tomb of Clemence in the old church of La 
Daurade. The great hall in which the Floral Games 
are held was encumbered with scaffoldings, and I 
was unable to admire the long series of busts of the 
bards who have won prizes and the portraits of all 
the capitouls of Toulouse. As a compensation I was 
introduced to a big bookcase, filled with the poems 
that have been crowned since the days of the trou 
badours (a portentous collection), and the big butcher 's 
knife with which, according to the legend, Henry, 
Duke of Montmorency, who had conspired against the 





great cardinal with Gaston of Orleans and Mary de 
Medici, was, in 1632, beheaded on this spot by the 
order of Richelieu. With these objects the interest of 
the Capitol was exhausted. The building, indeed, 
has not the grandeur of its name, which is a sort 
of promise that the visitor will find some sensible 
embodiment of the old Roman tradition that once 
flourished in this part of France. It is inferior in 
impressiveness to the other three famous Capitols of 
the modern world, that of Rome (if I may call the 
present structure modern) and those of Washington 
and Albany! 

The only Roman remains at Toulouse are to be 
found in the museum, a very interesting establish 
ment, which I was condemned to see as imperfectly 
as I had seen the Capitol. It was being rearranged; 
and the gallery of paintings, which is the least in 
teresting feature, was the only part that was not 
upside-down. The pictures are mainly of the mo 
dern French school, and I remember nothing but a 
powerful though disagreeable specimen of Henner, 
who paints the human body, and paints it so well, 
with a brush dipped in blackness; and, placed among 
the paintings, a bronze replica of the charming young 
David of Mercie. These things have been set out in 
the church of an old monastery, long since suppressed, 
and the rest of the collection occupies the cloisters. 
These are two in number, a small one, which you 
enter first from the street, and a very vast and ele 
gant one beyond it, which with its light Gothic arches 



  

and slim columns (of the fourteenth century), its broad 
walk, its little garden, with old tombs and statues in 
the centre, is by far the most picturesque, the most 
sketchable, spot in Toulouse. It must be doubly so 
when the Roman busts, inscriptions, slabs and sarco 
phagi, are ranged along the walls; it must indeed (to 
compare small things with great, and as the judicious 
Murray remarks) bear a certain resemblance to the 
Campo Santo at Pisa. But these things are absent 
now; the cloister is a litter of confusion, and its trea 
sures have been stowed away, confusedly, in sundry 
inaccessible rooms. The custodian attempted to con 
sole me by telling me that when they are exhibited 
again it will be on a scientific basis, and with an 
order and regularity of which they were formerly 
innocent. But I was not consoled. I wanted simply 
the spectacle, the picture, and I didn 't care in the 
least for the classification. Old Roman fragments, ex 
posed to light in the open air, under a southern sky, 
in a quadrangle round a garden, have an immortal 
charm simply in their general effect; and the charm 
is all the greater when the soil of the very place has 
yielded them up. 







XXI. 

MY real consolation was an hour I spent in Saint- 
Sernin, one of the noblest churches in southern France, 
and easily the first among those of Toulouse. This 
great structure, a masterpiece of twelfth-century ro- 
manesque, and dedicated to Saint Saturninus, the 
Toulousains have abbreviated, is, I think, alone worth 
a journey to Toulouse. What makes it so is the 
extraordinary seriousness of its interior; no other term 
occurs to me as expressing so well the character of 
its clear gray nave. As a general thing, I do not 
favor the fashion of attributing moral qualities to 
buildings; I shrink from talking about tender porticos 
and sincere campanili; but I find I cannot get on at 
all without imputing some sort of morality to Saint- 
Sernin. As it stands to-day, the church has been 
completely restored by Viollet-le-Duc. The exterior is 
of brick, and has little, charm save that of a tower of 
four rows of arches, narrowing together as they ascend. 
The nave is of great length and height, the barrel-roof 
of stone, the effect of the round arches and pillars in 
the triforium especially fine. There are two low aisles 
on either side. The choir is very deep and narrow; 
it seems to close together, and looks as if it were 
meant for intensely earnest rites. The transepts are 
most noble, especially the arches of the second tier. 
The whole church is narrow for its length, and is 



  

singularly complete and homogeneous. As I say all 
this, I feel that I quite fail to give an impression of 
its manly gravity, its strong proportions, or of the lone 
some look of its renovated stones as I sat there while 
the October twilight gathered. It is a real work of 
art, a high conception. The crypt, into which I was 
eventually led captive by an importunate sacristan, is 
quite another affair, though indeed I suppose it may 
also be spoken of as a work of art. It is a rich museum 
of relics, and contains the head of Saint Thomas 
Aquinas, wrapped up in a napkin and exhibited in a 
glass case. The sacristan took a lamp and guided me 
about, presenting me to one saintly remnant after an 
other. The impression was grotesque, but some of 
the objects were contained in curious old cases of 
beaten silver and brass; these things, at least, which 
looked as if they had been transmitted from the early 
church, were venerable. There was, however, a kind 
of wholesale sanctity about the place which overshot 
the mark; it pretends to be one of the holiest spots 
in the world. The effect is spoiled by the way the 
sacristans hang about and offer to take you into it for 
ten sous, I was accosted by two and escaped from 
another, and by the familiar manner in which you 
pop in and out. This episode rather broke the charm 
of Saint-Sernin, so that I took my departure and went 
in search of the cathedral. It was scarcely worth find 
ing, and struck me as an odd, dislocated fragment. 
The front consists only of a portal, beside which a tall 
brick tower, of a later period, has been erected. The 





nave was wrapped in dimness, with a few scattered 
lamps. I could only distinguish an immense vault, 
like a high cavern, without aisles. Here and there in 
the gloom was a kneeling figure; the whole place was 
mysterious and lop-sided. The choir was curtained 
off; it appeared not to correspond with the nave, that 
is, not to have the same axis. The only other ec 
clesiastical impression I gathered at Toulouse came to 
me in the church of La Daurade, of which the front, 
on the quay by the Garonne, was closed with scaffold 
ings; so that one entered it from behind, where it is 
completely masked by houses, through a door which 
has at first no traceable connection with it. It is a 
vast, high, modernized, heavily decorated church, dimly 
lighted at all times, I should suppose, and enriched 
by the shades of evening at the time I looked into it. 
I perceived that it consisted mainly of a large square, 
beneath a dome, in the centre of which a single person 
a lady was praying with the utmost absorption. 
The manner of access to the church interposed such 
an obstacle to the outer profanities that I had a sense 
of intruding, and presently withdrew, carrying with me 
a picture of the vast, still interior, the gilded roof 
gleaming in the twilight, and the solitary worshipper. 
What was she praying for, and was she not almost 
afraid to remain there alone? 

. For the rest, the picturesque at Toulouse consists 
principally of the walk beside the Garonne, which is 
spanned, to the faubourg of Saint-Cyprien, by a stout 
brick bridge. This hapless suburb, the baseness of 



  

whose site is noticeable, lay for days under the water 
at the time of the last inundations. The Garonne 
had almost mounted to the roofs of the houses, and 
the place continues to present a blighted, frightened 
look. Two or three persons, with whom I had some 
conversation, spoke of that time as a memory of horror. 
I have not done with my Italian comparisons; I shall 
never have done with them. I am therefore free to 
say that in the way in which Toulouse looks out on 
the Garonne there was something that reminded me 
vaguely of the way in which Pisa looks out on the 
Arno. The red-faced houses all of brick along the 
quay have a mixture of brightness and shabbiness, as 
well as the fashion of the open loggia in the top- 
story. The river, with another bridge or two, might 
be the Arno, and the buildings on the other side of 
it a hospital, a suppressed convent dip their feet 
into it with real southern cynicism. I have spoken of 
the old Hotel d Assezat as the best house at Toulouse ; 
with the exception of the cloister of the museum, it is 
the only "bit" I remember. It has fallen from the 
state of a noble residence of the sixteenth century to 
that of a warehouse and a set of offices; but a certain 
dignity lingers in its melancholy court, which is divided 
from the street by a gateway that is still imposing, 
and in which a clambering vine and a red Virginia- 
creeper were suspended to the rusty walls of brick 
stone. 

The most interesting house at Toulouse is far from 
being the most striking, At the door of No. 50 Rue 





des Filatiers, a featureless, solid structure, was found 
hanging, one autumn evening, the body of the young 
Marc-Antoine Galas, whose ill-inspired suicide was to 
be the first act of a tragedy so horrible. The fana 
ticism aroused in the townsfolk by this incident; the 
execution by torture of Jean Galas, accused as a 
Protestant of having hanged his son, who had gone 
over to the Church of Rome; the ruin of the family; 
the claustration of the daughters; the flight of the 
widow to Switzerland; her introduction to Voltaire; 
the excited zeal of that incomparable partisan, and 
the passionate persistence with which, from year to 
year, he pursued a reversal of judgment, till at last he 
obtained it, and devoted the tribunal of Toulouse to 
execration and the name of the victims to lasting 
wonder and pity, these things form part of one of 
the most interesting and touching episodes of the social 
history of the eighteenth century. The story has the 
fatal progression, the dark rigidity, of one of the tragic 
dramas of the Greeks. Jean Galas, advanced  in life, 
blameless, bewildered, protesting his innocence, had 
been broken on the wheel; and the sight of his decent 
dwelling, which brought home to me all that had been 
suffered there, spoiled for me, for half an hour, the 
impression of Toulouse. 



  



XXII. 

I SPENT but a few hours at Carcassonne; but those 
hours had a rounded felicity, and I cannot do better 
than transcribe from my note-book the little record 
made at the moment. Vitiated as it may be by 
crudity and incoherency, it has at any rate the fresh 
ness of a great emotion. This is the best quality that 
a reader may hope to extract from a narrative in 
which "useful information" and technical lore even of 
the most general sort are completely absent. For 
Carcassonne is moving, beyond a doubt; and the 
traveller who, in the course of a little tour in France, 
may have felt himself urged, in melancholy moments, 
to say that on the whole the disappointments are as 
numerous as the satisfactions, must admit that there 
can be nothing better than this. 

The country, after you leave Toulouse, continues 
to be charming; the more so that it merges its flatness 
in the distant Cevennes on one side, and on the other, 
far away on your right, in the richer range of the 
Pyrenees. Olives and cypresses, pergolas and vines, 
terraces on the roofs of houses, soft, iridescent moun 
tains, a warm yellow light, what more could the dif 
ficult tourist want? He left his luggage at the station, 
warily determined to look at the inn before committing 
himself to it. It was so evident (even to a cursory 
glance) that it might easily have been much better 





that he simply took his way to the town, with the 
whole of a superb afternoon before him. When I say 
the town, I mean the towns; there being two at Car 
cassonne, perfectly distinct, and each with excellent 
claims to the title. They have settled the matter be 
tween them, however, and the elder, the shrine of 
pilgrimage, to which the other is but a stepping-stone, 
or even, as I may say, a humble door-mat, takes the 
name of the Cite. You see nothing of the Cite from 
the station; it is masked by the agglomeration of the 
ville-basse, which is relatively (but only relatively) new. 
A wonderful avenue of acacias leads to it from the 
station, leads past it, rather, and conducts you to a 
little high-backed bridge over the Aude, beyond which, 
detached and erect, a distinct mediaeval silhouette, the 
Cite presents itself. Like a rival shop, on the in 
vidious side of a street, it has "no connection" with 
the establishment across the way, although the two 
places are united (if old Carcassonne may be said to 
be united to anything) by a vague little rustic fau 
bourg. Perched on its solid pedestal, the perfect de 
tachment of the Cite is what first strikes you. To take 
leave, without delay, of the ville-basse, I may say that 
the splendid acacias- I have mentioned flung a sum- 
merish dusk over the place, in which a few scattered 
remains of stout walls and big bastions looked vener 
able and picturesque. A little boulevard winds round 
the town, planted with trees and garnished with more 
benches than I ever saw provided by a soft-hearted 
municipality. This precinct had a warm, lazy, dusty, 



  

southern look, as if the people sat out-of-doors a great 
deal, and wandered about in the stillness of summer 
nights. The figure of the elder town, at these hours, 
must be ghostly enough on its neighboring hill. Even 
by day it has the air of a vignette of Gustave Dore, a 
couplet of Victor Hugo. It is almost too perfect, as 
if it were an enormous model, placed on a big green 
table at a museum. A steep, paved way, grass-grown 
like all roads where vehicles never pass, stretches up 
to it in the sun. It has a double enceinte, complete 
outer walls and complete inner (these, elaborately forti 
fied, are the more curious); and this congregation of 
ramparts, towers, bastions, battlements, barbicans, is 
as fantastic and romantic as you please. The approach 
I mention here leads to the gate that looks toward 
Toulouse, the Porte de 1 Aude. There is a second, 
on the other side, called, I believe, the Porte Nar- 
bonnaise, a magnificent gate, flanked with towers thick 
and tall, defended by elaborate outworks; and these 
two apertures alone admit you to the place, putting 
aside a small sally-port, protected by a great bastion, 
on the quarter that looks toward the Pyrenees. 

As a votary, always, in the first instance, of a 
general impression, I walked all round the outer en 
ceinte, a process on the very face of it entertaining. 
I took to the right of the Porte de PAude, without 
entering it, where the old moat has been filled in. 
The filling-in of the moat has created a grassy level 
at the foot of the big gray towers, which, rising at 
frequent intervals, stretch their stiff curtain of stone 


from point to point. The curtain drops without a 
fold upon the quiet grass, which was dotted here and 
there with a humble native, dozing away the golden 
afternoon. The natives of the elder Carcassonne are 
all humble; for the core of the Cite has shrunken and 
decayed, and there is little life among the ruins. A 
few tenacious laborers, who work in the neighboring 
fields or in the ville-basse , and sundry octogenarians 
of both sexes, who are dying where they have lived, 
and contribute much to the pictorial effect, these 
are the principal inhabitants. The process of con 
verting the place from an irresponsible old town into 
a conscious "specimen" has of course been attended 
with eliminations; the population has, as a general 
thing, been restored away. I should lose no time in 
saying that restoration is the great mark of the Cite. 
M. Viollet-le-Duc has worked his will upon it, put it 
into perfect order, revived the fortifications in every 
detail. I do not pretend to judge the performance, 
carried out on a scale and in a spirit which, really 
impose themselves on the imagination. Few archi 
tects have had such a chance, and M. Viollet-le-Duc 
must have been the envy of the whole restoring fra 
ternity. The image of a more crumbling Carcassonne 
rises in the mind, and there is no doubt that forty 
years ago the place was more affecting. On the other 
hand, as we see it to-day, it is a wonderful evocation; 
and if there is a great deal of new in the old , there 
is plenty of old in the new. The repaired crenella- 
tions, the inserted patches, of the walls of the outer 



circle sufficiently express this commixture. My walk 
brought me into full view of the Pyrenees, which, now 
that the sun had begun to sink and the shadows to 
grow long, had a wonderful violet glow. The platform 
at the base of the walls has a greater width on this 
side, and it made the scene more complete. Two or 
three old crones had crawled out of the Porte Nar- 
bonnaise, to examine the advancing visitor; and a 
very ancient peasant, lying there with his back against 
a tower, was tending half a dozen lean sheep. A poor 
man in a very old blouse, crippled and with crutches 
lying beside him, had been brought out and placed 
on a stool, where he enjoyed the afternoon as best he 
might. He looked so ill and so patient that I spoke 
to him; found that his legs were paralyzed and he was 
quite helpless. He had formerly been seven years in 
the army, and had made the campaign of Mexico with 
Bazaine. Born in the old Cite, he had come back 
there to end his days. It seemed strange, as he sat 
there, with those romantic walls behind him and the 
great picture of the Pyrenees in front, to think that he 
had been across the seas to the far-away new world, 
had made part of a famous expedition, and was now 
a cripple at the gate of the mediaeval city where he 
had played as a child. All this struck me as a great 
deal of history for so modest a figure, a poor little 
figure that could only just unclose its palm for a small 
silver coin. 

He was not the only acquaintance I made at Car 
cassonne. I had not pursued my circuit of the walls 


much further when I encountered a person of quite 
another type, of whom I asked some question which 
had just then presented itself, and who proved to be 
the very genius of the spot. He was a sociable son 
of the ville-basse, a gentleman, and, as I afterwards 
learned, an employe at the prefecture, a person, in 
short, much esteemed at Carcassonne. (I may say all 
this, as he will never read these pages.) He had been 
ill for a month, and in the company of his little dog 
was taking his first airing; in his own phrase he was 
amour eux-fou de la Cite, he could lose no time in 
coming back to it. He talked of it, indeed, as a lover, 
and , giving me for half an hour the advantage of his 
company, showed me all the points of the place. (I 
speak here always of the outer enceinte; you penetrate 
to the inner which is the specialty of Carcassonne, 
and the great curiosity only by application at the 
lodge of the regular custodian, a remarkable func 
tionary, who, half an hour later, when I had been in 
troduced to him by my friend the amateur, inarched 
me over the fortifications with a tremendous accompani 
ment of dates and technical terms.) My companion 
pointed out to me in particular the traces of different 
periods in the structure of the walls. There is a por 
tentous amount of history embedded in them, begin 
ning with Romans and Visigoths; here and there are 
marks of old breaches, hastily repaired. We passed 
into the town, into that part of it not included in the 
citadel. It is the queerest and most fragmentary little 
place in the world, as everything save the fortifications 



  

is being suffered to crumble away, in order that the 
spirit of M. Viollet-le-Duc alone may pervade it, and 
it may subsist simply as a magnificent shell. As the 
leases of the wretched little houses fall in, the ground 
is cleared of them; and a mumbling old woman ap 
proached me in the course of my circuit, inviting me 
to condole with her on the disappearance of so many 
of the hovels which in the last few hundred years 
(since the collapse of Carcassonne as a stronghold) 
had attached themselves to the base of the walls, in 
the space between the two circles. These habitations, 
constructed of materials taken from the ruins, nestled 
there snugly enough. This intermediate space had 
therefore become a kind of street, which has crumbled 
in turn, as the fortress has grown up again. There 
are other streets, beside, very diminutive and vague, 
where you pick your way over heaps of rubbish and 
become conscious of unexpected faces looking at you 
out of windows as detached as the cherubic heads. 
The most definite thing in the place was the little 
cafe, where the waiters, I think, must be the ghosts of 
the old Visigoths; the most definite, that is, after the 
little chateau and the little cathedral. Everything in 
the Cite is little; you can walk round the walls in 
twenty minutes. On the drawbridge of the chateau, 
which, with a picturesque old face, flanking towers, 
and a dry moat, is to-day simply a bare caserne, 
lounged half a dozen soldiers, unusually small. No 
thing could be more odd than to see these objects en 
closed in a receptacle which has much of the appearance 
of an enormous toy. The Cite and its population 
vaguely reminded me of an immense Noah 's ark. 



XXIII. 

CARCASSONNE dates from the Roman occupation of 
Gaul. The place commanded one of the great roads 
into Spain, and in the fourth century Romans and 
Franks ousted each other from such a point of vantage. 
In the year 436, Theodoric, King of the Visigoths, 
superseded both these parties; and it is during his oc 
cupation that the inner enceinte was raised upon the 
ruins of the Roman fortifications. Most of the Visigoth 
towers that are still erect are seated upon Roman sub 
structions which appear to have been formed hastily, 
probably at the moment of the Frankish invasion. 
The authors of these solid defences, though occasionally 
disturbed, held Carcassonne and the neighboring coun 
try, in which they had established their kingdom of 
Septimania, till the year 713, when they were expelled- 
by the Moors of Spain, who ushered in an uniflumined 
period of four centuries, of which no traces remain. 
These facts I derived from a source no more recondite 
than a pamphlet by M. Viollet-le-Duc, a very luminous 
description of the fortifications, which you may buy 
from the accomplished custodian. The writer makes 
a jump to the year 1209, when Carcassonne, then 
forming part of the realm of the viscounts of Beziers 
and infected by the Albigensian heresy, was besieged, 
in the name of the Pope, by the terrible Simon de 
Montfort and his army of crusaders. Simon was ac 
customed to success, and the town succumbed in the 
course of a fortnight. Thirty-one years later, having 
passed into the hands of the King of France, it was 
again besieged by the young Raymond de Trincavel, 
the last of the viscounts of Beziers; and of this siege 
M. Viollet-le-Duc gives a long and minute account,
