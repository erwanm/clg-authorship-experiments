ashamed of ? " 

" I 'll tell } r ou when I Ve been doing anything to 
be ashamed of," growled Lapham. 

" Oh no, you won't ! " said his wife jollily. 
" You 'll only be hard on the rest of us. Come 
now, Si ; what is it ? " 

Lapham frowned into his coffee with sulky dignity, 
and said, without looking up, " I wonder what that 
fellow wanted here last night ?" 

"What fellow?" 

" Corey. I found him here when I came home, and 
he said he wanted to see me ; but he wouldn't stop." 

" Where was he ? " 

" In the sitting-room." 

" Was Pen there ? " 

"I didn't see her." 

Mrs. Lapham paused, with her hand on the cream- 
jug. " Why, what in the land did he want ? Did 
he say he wanted you ? " 

" That 's what he said." 

" And then he wouldn't stay ? " 

" No." 

" Well, then, I 'll tell you just what it is, Silas 
Lapham. He came here " she looked about the 
room and lowered her voice " to see you about 
Irene, and then he hadn't the courage." 

" I guess he 's got courage enough to do pretty 
much what he wants to," said Lapham glumly. 
" All I know is, he was here. You better ask Pen 
about it, if she ever gets down." 



 

" I guess I shan't wait for her," said Mrs. Lap- 
ham ; and, as her husband closed the front door 
after him, she opened that of her daughter's room 
and entered abruptly. 

The girl sat at the window, fully dressed, and as 
if she had been sitting there a long time. Without 
rising, she turned her face towards her mother. It 
merely showed black against the light, and revealed 
nothing till her mother came close to her with suc 
cessive questions. " Why, how long have you been 
up, Pen ? Why don't you come to your breakfast ? 
Did you see Mr. Corey when he called last night ? 
Why, what 's the matter with you ? What have 
you been crying about ? 

" Have I been crying ? " 

" Yes ! Your cheeks are all wet ! " 

" I thought they were on fire. Well, I'll tell 
you what's happened." She rose, and then 
fell back in her chair. " Lock the door ! " she 
ordered, and her mother mechanically obeyed. " I 
don't want Irene in here. There's nothing the 
matter. Only, Mr. Corey offered himself to me last 
night." 

Her mother remained looking at her, helpless, not 
so much with amaze, perhaps, as dismay. 

" Oh, I 'm not a ghost ! I wish I was ! You 
had better sit down, mother. You have got to 
know all about it." 

Mrs. Lapham dropped nervelessly into the chair 
at the other window, and while the girl went slowly 
but briefly on, touching only the vital points of the 



 

story, and breaking at times into a bitter drollery, 
she sat as if without the power to speak or stir. 

" Well, that 's all, mother. I should say I had 
dreamt it, if I had slept any last night ; but I guess 
it really happened." 

The mother glanced round at the bed, and said,- 
glad to occupy herself delay ingly with the minor 
care : " Why, you have been sitting up all night ! 
You will kill yourself." 

" I don't know about killing myself, but I 've been 
sitting up all night," answered the girl. Then, see 
ing that her mother remained blankly silent again, 
she demanded, " Why don't you blame me, mother ? 
Why don't you say that I led him on, and tried to 
get him away from her ? Don't you believe I did ? " 

Her mother made her no answer, as if these 
ravings of self-accusal needed none. " Do you 
think," she asked simply, " that he got the idea 
you cared for him ? " 

" He knew it ! How could I keep it from him ? 
I said I didn't at first ! " 

" It was no use," sighed the mother. " You 
might as well said you did. It couldn't help Irene 
any, if you didn't." 

" I always tried to help her with him, even when 
I 

" Yes, I know. But she never was equal to him. 
I saw that from the start ; but I tried to blind 
myself to it. And when he kept coming " 

" You never thought of me ! " cried the girl, with 
a bitterness that reached her mother's heart. " I 



 

was nobody ! I couldn't feel ! No one could care 
for me ! " The turmoil of despair, of triumph, of 
remorse and resentment, which filled her soul, tried 
to express itself in the words. 

" No," said the mother humbly. " I didn't think 
*of you. Or I didn't think of you enough. It did 

come across me sometimes that may be But it 

didn't seem as if And your going on so for 

Irene " 

" You let me go on. You made me always go 
and talk with him for her, and you didn't think I 
would talk to him for myself. Well, I didn't ! " 

" I 'm punished for it. When did you begin to 
care for him ? " 

" How do I know ? What difference does it 
make ? It's all over now, no matter when it began. 
He won't come here any more, unless I let him." 
She could not help betraying her pride in this 
authority of hers, but she went on anxiously enough, 
" What will you say to Irene ? She 's safe as far as 
I 'm concerned ; but if he don't care for her, what 
will you do ? " 

" I don't know what to do," said Mrs. Lapham. 
She sat in an apathy from which she apparently 
could not rouse herself. "I don't see as anything 
can be done." 

Penelope laughed in a pitying derision. 

" Well, let things go on then. But they won't go 
on." 

"No, they won't go on," echoed her mother. 
" She 's pretty enough, and she 's capable ; and your 



 

father's got the money I don't know what I'm 
saying ! She ain't equal to him, and she never was. 
I kept feeling it all the time, and yet I kept blinding 
myself." 

" If he had ever cared for her," said Penelope, 
" it wouldn't have mattered whether she was equal 
to him or not I'm not equal to him either." 

Her mother went on : "I might have thought it 

was you ; but I had got set Well ! I can see it 

all clear enough, now it 'a too late. I don't know 
what to do." 

" And what do you expect me to do V demanded 
the girl. " Do you want me to go to Irene and tell 
her that I 've got him away from her ? " 

" good Lord ! " cried Mrs. Lapham. " What 
shall I do ? What do you want I should do, Pen ? " 

" Nothing for me," said Penelope. " I 've had it 
out with myself. Now do the best you can for 
Irene." 

" I couldn't say you 'had done wrong, if you was 
to marry him to-day." 

" Mother ! " 

" No, I couldn't. I couldn't say but what you 
had been good and faithful all through, and you had 
a perfect right to do it. There ain't any one to 
blame. He 's behaved like a gentleman, and I can 
see now that he never thought of her, and that it 
was you all the while. Well, marry him, then ! 
He 's got the right, and so have you." 

" What about Irene ? I don't want you to talk 
about me. I can take care of myself." 



 

"She's nothing but a child. It's only a fancy 
with her. She 'll get over it. She hain't really got 
her heart set on him." 

" She 's got her heart set on him, mother. She 's 
got her whole life set on him. You know that." 

" Yes, that 's so," said the mother, as promptly 
as if she had been arguing to that rather than the 
contrary effect. 

"If I could give him to her, I would. But he 
isn't mine to give." She added in a burst of despair, 
" He isn't mine to keep !" 

" Well," said Mrs. Lapham, " she has got to bear 
it. I don't know what 's to come of it all. But she 's 
got to bear her share of it," She rose and went 
toward the door. 

Penelope ran after her in a sort of terror. 
" You 're not going to tell Irene ? " she gasped, 
seizing her mother by either shoulder. 

"Yes, I am," said Mrs. Lapham. "If she's a 
woman grown, she can bear 'a woman's burden." 

" I can't let you tell Irene," said the girl, letting 
fall her face on her mother's neck "Not Irene," 
she moaned. " I 'm afraid to let you. How can I 
ever look at her again ? " 

" Why, you haven't done anything, Pen," said her 
mother soothingly. 

" I wanted to ! Yes, I must have done something. 
How could I help it ? I did care for him from the 
first, and I must have tried to make him like me. 
Do you think I did ? No, no ! You mustn't tell 
Irene ! Not not yet ! Mother ! Yes ! I did 



 

try to get him from her ! " she cried, lifting her 
head, and suddenly looking her mother in the face 
with those large dim eyes of hers. " What do you 
think ? Even last night ! It was the first time I 
ever had him all to myself, for myself, and I know 
now that I tried to make him think that I was pretty 
and funny. And I didn't try to make him think 
of her. I knew that I pleased him, and I tried to 
please him more. Perhaps I could have kept him 
from saying that he cared for me ; but when I saw 
he did I must have seen it I couldn't. I had 
never had him to myself, and for myself before. I 
needn't have seen him at all, but I wanted to see 
him ; and when I was sitting there alone with him, 
how do I know what I did to let him feel that I 
cared for him ? Now, will you tell Irene ? I never 
thought he did care for me, and never expected him 
to. But I liked him. Yes I did like him ! Tell 
her that ! Or else I will." 

" If it was to tell her he was dead," began Mrs. 
Lapham absently. 

" How easy it would be ! " cried the girl in self- 
mockery. " But he 's worse than dead to her ; and 
so am I. I've turned it over a million ways, 
mother ; I 've looked at it in every light you can 
put it in, and I can't make anything but misery out 
of it. You can see the misery at the first glance, 
and you can't see more or less if you spend your life 
looking at it." She laughed again, as if the hope 
lessness of the thing amused her. Then she flew to 
the extreme of self-assertion. " Well, I have a right 

to him, and he has a right to me. If he 's never 
done anything to make her think he cared for her, 
and I know he hasn't ; it 's all been our doing, 
then he 's free and I 'm free. We can't make her 

happy whatever we do ; and why shouldn't I 

No, that won't do ! I reached that point before ! " 
She broke again into her desperate laugh. " You 
may try now, mother ! " 

" I 'd best speak to your father first " 

Penelope smiled a little more forlornly than she 
had laughed. 

" Well, yes ; the Colonel will have to know. It 
isn't a trouble that I can keep to myself exactly. It 
seems to belong to too many other people." 

Her mother took a crazy encouragement from her 
return to her old way of saying things. " Perhaps 
he can think of something." 

" Oh, I don't doubt but the Colonel will know 
just what to do ! " 

" You mustn't be too down-hearted about it. It 
it'll all come right " 

"You tell Irene that, mother." 

Mrs. Lapham had put her hand on the door-key ; 
she dropped it, and looked at the girl with a sort of 
beseeching appeal for the comfort she could not 
imagine herself. "Don't look at me, mother," said 
Penelope, shaking her head. " You know that if 
Irene were to die without knowing it, it wouldn't 
come right for me." 

" Pen ! " 

" I 've read of cases where a girl gives up the man 



 

that loves her so as to make some other girl happy 
that the man doesn't love. That might be done." 

" Your father would think you were a fool," said 
Mrs. Lapham, finding a sort of refuge in her strong 
disgust for the pseudo heroism. " No ! If there 's 
to be any giving up, let it be by the one that shan't 
make anybody but herself suffer. There 's trouble 
and sorrow enough in the world, without making it 
on purpose ! " 

She unlocked the door, but Penelope slipped 
round and set herself against it. " Irene shall not 
give up ! " 

" I will see your father about it," said the mother. 
" Let me out now " 

" Don't let Irene come here ! " 

" No. I will tell her that you haven't slept. Go 
to bed now, and try to get some rest. She isn't up 
herself yet. You must have some breakfast." 

" No ; let me sleep if I can. I can get something 
vhen I wake up. I 'll come down if I can't sleep. 
Life has got to go on. It does when there 's a death 
in the house, and this is only a little worse." 

" Don't you talk nonsense ! " cried Mrs. Lapham, 
with angry authority. 

" Well, a little better, then," said Penelope, with 
meek concession. 

Mrs. Lapham attempted to say something, and 
could not. She went out and opened Irene's door. 
The girl lifted her head drowsily from her pillow 
" Don't disturb your sister when you get up, Irene. 
She hasn't slept well " 



 

" Please don't talk ! I 'm almost dead with sleep!" 
returned Irene. " Do go, mamma ! I shan't disturb 
her." She turned her face down in the pillow, and 
pulled the covering up over her ears. 

The mother slowly closed the door and went 
downstairs, feeling bewildered and baffled almost 
beyond the power to move. The time had been 
when she would have tried to find out why this 
judgment had been sent upon her. But now she 
could not feel that the innocent suffering of others 
was inflicted for her fault ; she shrank instinctively 
from that cruel and egotistic misinterpretation of 
the mystery of pain and loss. She saw her two 
children, equally if differently dear to her, destined 
to trouble that nothing could avert, and she could 
not blame either of them ; she could not blame 
the means of this misery to them ; he was as in 
nocent as they, and though her heart was sore 
against him in this first moment, she could still be 
just to him in it. She was a woman who had been 
used to seek the light by striving ; she had hitherto 
literally worked to it But it is the curse of pro 
sperity that it takes work away from us, and shuts 
that door to hope and health of spirit. In this 
house, where everything had come to be done for 
her, she had no tasks to interpose between her and 
her despair. She sat down in her own room and let 
her hands fall in her lap, the hands that had once 
been so helpful and busy, and tried to think it all 
out. She had never heard of the fate that was once 
supposed to appoint the sorrows of men irrespective 
of their blamelessness or blame, before the time 



 

when it came to be believed that sorrows were 
penalties; but in her simple way she recognised 
something like that mythic power when she rose 
from her struggle with the problem, and said aloud 
to herself, " Well, the witch is in it." Turn which 
way she would, she saw no escape from the misery 
to come the misery which had come already to 
Penelope and herself, and that must come to Irene 
and her father. She started when she definitely 
thought of her husband, and thought with what 
violence it would work in every fibre of his rude 
strength. She feared that, and she feared some 
thing worse the effect which his pride and am 
bition might seek to give it ; and it was with terror 
of this, as well as the natural trust with which a 
woman must turn to her husband in any anxiety at 
last, that she felt she could not wait for evening to 
take counsel with him. When she considered how 
wrongly he might take it all, it seemed as if it 
were already known to him, and she was impatient 
to prevent his error. 

She sent out for a messenger, whom she despatched 
with a note to his place of business : " Silas, I should 
like to ride with you this afternoon. Can't you come 
home early ? Persis." And she was at dinner with 
Irene, evading her questions about Penelope, when 
answer came that he would be at the house with the 
buggy at half-past two. It is easy to put off a girl 
who has but one thing in her head ; but though 
Mrs. Lapham could escape without telling anything 
of Penelope, she could not escape seeing how wholly 
Irene was engrossed with hopes now turned so vain 



 SILAS LAPHAM. 

and impossible. She was still talking of that dinner, 
of nothing but that dinner, and begging for flattery 
of herself and praise of him, which her mother had 
till now been so ready to give. 

" Seems to me you don't take very much interest, 
mamma !" she said, laughing and blushing atone point. 

" Yes, yes, I do," protested Mrs. Lapham, and 
then the girl prattled on. 

" I guess I shall get one of those pins that Xanny 
Corey had in her hair. I think it would become 
me, don't you ? " 

" Yes ; but Irene I don't like to have you go on 
so, till unless he 's said something to show You 

oughtn't to give yourself up to thinking " But 

at this the girl turned so white, and looked such re 
proach at her, that she added frantically : " Yes, 
get the pin. It is just the thing for you ! But 
don't disturb Penelope. Let her alone till I get 
back. I'm going out to ride with your father. 
He 'll be here in half an hour. Are you through ? 
Ring, then. Get yourself that fan you saw the 
other day. Your father won't say anything ; he likes 
to have you look well. I could see his eyes on you 
half the time the other night." 

" I should have liked to have Pen go with me," 
said Irene, restored to her normal state of innocent 
selfishness by these flatteries. " Don't you suppose 
she 'll be up in time ? What 's the matter with her 
that she didn't sleep ? " 

" I don't know. Better let her alone." 

" Well," submitted Irene. 



XVIII. 

MRS. LAPHAM went away to put on her bonnet 
and cloak, and she was waiting at the window when 
her husband drove up. She opened the door and 
ran down the steps. " Don't get out ; I can help 
myself in," and she clambered to his side, while he 
kept the fidgeting mare still with voice and touch. 

"Where do you want I should go?" he asked, 
turning the buggy. 

" Oh, I don't care. Out Brookline way, I guess. 
I wish you hadn't brought this fool of a horse," she 
gave way petulantly. " I wanted to have a talk." 

" When I can't drive this mare and talk too, I 'll 
sell out altogether," said Lapham. " She 'll be 
quiet enough when she 's had her spin." 

" Well," said his wife ; and while they were 
making their way across the city to the Milldam she 
answered certain questions he asked about some 
points in the new house. 

" I should have liked to have you stop there," 
he began ; but she answered so quickly, " Not to 
day," that he gave it up and turned his horse's head 
westward when they struck Beacon Street. 

 



 

He let the mare out, and he did not pull her in 
till he left the Brighton road and struck off under 
the low boughs that met above one of the quiet 
streets of Brookline, where the stone cottages, with 
here and there a patch of determined ivy on their 
northern walls, did what they could to look English 
amid the glare of the autumnal foliage. The smooth 
earthen track under the mare's hoofs was scattered 
with flakes of the red and yellow gold that made 
the air luminous around them, and the perspective 
was gay with innumerable tints and tones. 

" Pretty sightly," said Lapham, with a long sign, 
letting the reins lie loose in his vigilant hand, to 
which he seemed to relegate the whole charge of 
the mare. " I want to talk with you about Rogers, 
Persis. He 's been getting in deeper and deeper 
with me ; and last night he pestered me half to 
death to go in with him in one of his schemes. I 
ain't going to blame anybody, but I hain't got very 
much confidence in Rogers. And I told him so last 
night." 

" Oh, don't talk to me about Rogers ! " his wife 
broke in. " There 's something a good deal more 
important than Rogers in the world, and more im 
portant than your business. It seems as if you 
couldn't think of anything else that and the .new 
house. Did you suppose I wanted to ride so as to 
talk Rogers with you ? " she demanded, yielding to 
the necessity a wife feels of making her husband 
pay for her suffering, even if he has not inflicted it. 
" I declare " 



 

"Well, hold on, now!" said Lapham. "What 
do you want to talk about? I 'm listening."
