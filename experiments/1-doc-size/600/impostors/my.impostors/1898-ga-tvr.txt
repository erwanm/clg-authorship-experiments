and had had dinner and he was himself 
again and would have spoken alone with 
me, I ran and got on my horse, and all the 
brothers stood on the corridor to see me 
go. He came up to me and blessed me, 
and whispered : 'Tell no one, my son. If 
you do and he gave me a look that made 
my hair crackle at the roots. And to this 
clay I have told no one. Did I tell my 
parents the priest would know in six 



 

hours. No boy has stayed here that I 
like. But now " 

" We will go to the hill and see for our 
selves," said Roldan, promptly, and Aclan 
gasped with horror and delight. 

" Ay, I knew you would. I am brave, 
but I dared not go myself that padre is 
too big. I wake up in the night and see 
his hands pawing in the air. But three of 
us we need fear no one." 

" We will go as soon as the guests are 
gone. I have heard of this gold. In 
Europe I have an uncle who has trav 
elled and has told me many things 
bueno, in Europe, they make it into 
money and give it for things in big houses 
they call shops. Even here, in Monterey, 
and perhaps the other towns, they have a 
little it comes from Mexico. My uncle 
said that one reason we were so happy was 
because we had so little money none at 
all, we might say. That we got what we 
wanted out of the earth, or by trading with 
one another or with the skippers from Bos 
ton, who are glad to give us what we need 
from other lands in return for our hides 



 

and tallow. So, if we find this gold 
perhaps we had better say nothing about 
it; but to find it that will be a great, a 
grand adventure." 

" We'll tell if we find it," said Adan, 
philosophically. 

The boys concocted a plan of campaign 
to their satisfaction, then went home to 
supper. Don Tiburcio and his wife, Dona 
Martina, were already seated at the table 
in the big bare room. The grandee was a 
huge man with a soft profile, and cheeks as 
large and cream-hued as one of the mag 
nolias hanging in the patio. He had an 
expression of indolent good-nature above 
his straight mouth, and long hands that 
looked lean and hard when they closed 
suddenly. He was a man of much influence 
in the politics of his country. His 
small-clothes were of dark green cloth with 
large silver buttons, the lace on his linen 
was fine and abundant. Dona Martina 
wore a gown of stiff flowered silk and a 
profusion of topaz ornaments. As the 
boys entered and bowed respectfully, Don 
Tiburcio eyed them keenly, but shook 
them cordially bv the hand. 



 

" So you are the son of Mateo Casta- 
nada," he said to Roldan. " It is evident 
enough, although you have something in 
the face that he has not. Otherwise I 
should not have done him to death in 
more than one political battle. Well, my 
sons, you are very welcome, and the longer 
you stay with us the better. The officers 
passed here some days ago Rafael hid 
in the garret for the two days I feasted 
them, and they do not know that I have a 
son so young. Well, you are in good 
time to help my son enjoy his Christmas." 

There was an abundant supper of meat 
with hot pepper-sauce, tomatoes and eggs 
baked together, and many dulces. The 
boys wondered if dried meat and coarse 
cakes were part of an adventurous dream. 

The next morning chocolate was brought 
to the boys at half-past five, after which 
they dressed, and mounting the mustangs 
awaiting their pleasure in the courtyard, 
went off for a morning canter. At Rol- 
dan's suggestion they reconnoitred the 
hills behind the Mission and got the bear 
ings definitely shaped in their minds; the 







 

great raid was to be at night. They 
returned to a big breakfast at nine o'clock, 
then rode out again to meet the expected 
guests. It was but a few moments before 
they saw several cavalcades approaching 
from as many different directions. The 
young men and women, in silken clothes 
of every hue, were on horses caparisoned 
with velvet, carved leather, and silver; in 
many instances a girl had proud posses 
sion of the saddle, while her swain bestrode 
the anquera behind, his arm supporting 
her waist. Roldan wondered if anything 
would ever induce him to sacrifice his dig 
nity like that. (It may be remarked here, 
as this history has only to do with the 
famous Californian's boyhood, that the 
day came when he could bow the knee to 
the fair sex with as graceful an ardour as 
did he not employ his sterner moments 
making laws and enforcing them.) The 
older folk travelled in carretas, the conveyance of the country, a springless wagon 
set on wheels cut from the solid thicknes 
of the tree. It was driven by garians, sitting astride the mustangs and singing 



 

lustily. The interior was lined with satin 
and padded, but was probably uncomfort 
able enough. Everybody looked smiling 
and happy, and a number of lads left their 
respective parties and cantered over to 
Rafael and his guests. A few moments 
later they all galloped at the top speed of 
their much-enduring mustangs to a great 
clump of oaks, where they dismounted 
and listened with breathless interest to 
the adventures of Roldan and Adan. All 
had been drafted, and must leave for bar 
racks with the new year. They complimented the adventurers in a curious 
mixture of stately Spanish and eager 
youthfulness, and their admiration was so 
apparent that our heroes would have 
doubled the dangers of the past on the 
spot. 

When they returned home to dinner the 
great space before the house was filled 
with shining horses pawing the ground 
under their heavy saddles. The court 
and corridors were an animated scene, 
overflowing with dons and donas in brilliant array. When dinner was over and 



 

the grown-up guests and young girls were 
lingering over the Christmas dulces, all 
the boys slipped away and went out to the 
huge kitchen, where countless Indian servants were busy or resting. They de 
manded four dozen eggs and help to blow 
them at once. The maids hastened to do 
the bidding of the little dons, and in less 
than a quarter of an hour the eggs were 
free of their natural contents, and all were 
busy refilling them with flour, or cologne, 
or scraps of gold and silver paper. Then 
the boys stuffed the fronts of their shirts, 
their sleeves, and their pockets with the 
eggs, and hid themselves among the palms 
of the court. Presently the guests came 
forth and scattered about the corridor, 
smiling and chatting in the soft subdued 



spanish way. Suddenly twelve eggs, 
thrown with supple wrist and aimed with 
unfailing dexterity, flew tli rough the air 
and crashed softly on the backs of caba- 
lleros curls and donas braids, flour pow 
dering, gold and silver paper glittering on 
the dense blackness of those California!! 
tresses, cologne shooting down dignified 



 

spines. There was a chorus of shrieks, 
and then, as every head whisked about, and 
as a blow did not count unless it struck 
at the back, the boys ran up to the corridors,
dodged under vengeful arms and 
continued the battle. Finally they were 
chased out into the open, and the guests 
having been provided with the remaining 
eggs by Dona Martina, the battle waged 
fierce and hot until, exhausted, the guests 
retired for siesta. 

But siesta was brief that day. In less 
than an hour's time all had reappeared 
and were mounting for the race. 



XV 

THE race took place in a field a mile 
from the house, on a straight track. 
Four vaqueros in black velvet small 
clothes trimmed with silver, spotless linen, 
and stiff glazed black sombreros, walked 
up and down, leading the impatient mus 
tangs. Two of these horses were a beau 
tiful bronze-gold in colour, with silver 
manes and tails, a breed peculiar to the 
Californias; one was black, the other as 
white as crystal. The family and guests 
of Casa Carillo sat on their horses, in their 
carretas, or stood just outside the fence 
surrounding the field. At one end were 
the several hundred Indians employed by 
Don Tiburcio, and several hundred more 
from the Mission. Father Osuna had 
also joined the party from the Casa, and 
Roldaa who had seen hundreds of horse 
races and was built on a more complex 
plan than his contemporaries, got as close 

to the priest as he dared and gave him his 
undivided attention. Padre Osuna was a 
man of unusual height and heaviness of 
build. His black eves were set close to 


his fine Roman nose. The mouth was so 
tightly compressed that its original curves 
were quite destroyed, and the intellectual 
development of the brow was very marked. 
His hands exerted a peculiar fascination 
over Roldan. They were of huge size, 
even for so big a man, lean and knotted, 
with square-tipped fingers. The skin on 
them was fine and brown : it looked as 
- jft as a woman's. He used them a good 
deal when talking, and not ungracefully; 
but they seemed to claw and grasp the 
air, to be independent of the arms hidden 
in the voluminous sleeves of the smart 
brown cassock. Other people watched 
those hands too they seemed to poss 
a magnetism of their own ; and everv one 

showed this priest great deference : he was 
one of the most successful disciplinarians 
in the Department of California, a bril 
liant speaker, an able adviser in matters 
of state, and a man of many social graces. 


" More agreeable to meet in the sala of 
the Mission than in a cave at midnight
thought Roldan. "Still " His scent for 
danger, particularly if it involved a match 
ing of wits, was very keen. 

The word was given. The race began. 
The dons shouted, the lovely faces between 
the bright folds of the rebosos flushed ex 
pectantly. From the black mass of Indians 
opposite came a mighty gurgle, which grad 
ually broke into a roar, 

" The black ! Fifty hides on the black ! " 

"The little bronze! She is a length 
ahead! Maclre cle dios! Six doubloons 
of Mexico on the little bronze ! " 

The priest pushed his way to the 
speaker, a wealthy ranchero who had been 
more than once to Mexico. 

" The white against the bronze, senor," 
he said. " Twenty otter skins to the six 
doubloons of Mexico." 

" Done, your reverence. I am honoured 
that you bet with me. But the white 
have you thought well, my father? " 

"She breathes well, and her legs are 
very clean." 



 

" True, my father, but look at the 
muscles of the little bronze. How they 
swell ! And the fire in the nostrils ! " 

" True, Don Jaime ; and if she wins, the 
skins are yours." 

As the horses darted down the track 
almost neck to neck, the excitement 
routed Spanish dignity. The dons stood 
up in their saddles, shouting and betting 
furiously. The women clapped their white 
idle hands, and cheered, and bet but 
with less recklessness : a small jewel or a 
second-best mantilla. As they could not 
remember what they had bet when the 
excitement was over, these debts were never 
paid ; but it pleased them mightily to 
make their little wagers. The men were 
betting ranchitas, horses, cattle, and, finally, 
their jewels and saddles and serapes. For 
each horse represented a different district 
of the Department, and there was much 
rivalry. 

The priest did not shout, and he made 
no more bets, but his eyes never left those 
figures speeding like arrows from the bow, 
the riders motionless as if but the effigies
of men strapped to the creatures of 
fire beneath. Sometimes the black gained, 
then the little bronze; once the white 
dashed a full three yards beyond his
fellows, and Roldan saw the great hands of 
the priest, which had been clinched against 
his shoulders, open spasmodically, then 
close harder than ever as the white quickly 
dropped back again. 

It was a very close race. The excite 
ment grew tense and painful. Even Rol 
dan felt it finally, and forgot the priest. 
The big bronze had quite dropped out 
of it and was lagging homeward, hardly 
greeted by a hiss. The others were almost 
neck and neck, the little bronze slightly in 
the lead. "She wins," thought Roldan, 
"No! No! The black! the black! Ay, 
no, the bronze! but no! no! Ay! Ay! 
Ay!" A roar went up that ended in a 
shriek. The black had won. 

Roldan looked at the priest. His skin 
was livid, his nostrils twitching. But his 
mouth and eyes told nothing. 

The crowd rode home, still excited, 
gay, cheerful. Their losses mattered not. 



 

Were not their acres numbered by the 
hundred thousand ? Did they not have 
more horses and cattle than they would 
ever count ? In those days of pleasure 
and plenty, of luxury and unconsidered 
generosity, a rancho, a caponara the less, 
meant a loss neither to be felt nor 
remembered. 

After the bountiful supper the guests 
loitered for a time in the courtyard, then 
the sala was cleared and the dance began. 
Several of the girls danced alone, while 
the caballeros clapped and shouted. Then 
all waltzed or took part in their only square 
dance, the contradanza. They kept it up 
until morning. Needless to say, our 
heroes went to bed at an early hour. 

They were up the next morning with 
the dawn, and in company with Rafael and 
the other guests of their own age, went for 
their canter. This time they avoided the 
hills behind the Mission, as they had no 
wish to share their secret, and a chance 
word might divulge all. They rode toward 
the hills at the head of the valley. Roldan 
was still the hero of the hour, and Rafael, 



 

although the most generous of boys, 
resented it a little. He was not without 
ambitions of his own, and determined to 
seize the first opportunity to remind his 
companions that the son of Don Tiburcio 
Carillo, the greatest ranchero of that
section of the Californias, had not the habit 
to occupy the humble position of tag- 
behind even to so brilliant and adventur 
ous a guest as Rolclan Castaiiada. 

He soon found his opportunity. 

As they reached the first hill they saw a 
bull feeding on its summit. " Aha ! " cried 
the young don of the Rancho Encarna- 
cion. " Now I will make for you a little 
morning entertainment, my friends. Col- 
iar! coliar!" 

"No! no! "cried the boys. "The hill 
is too steep. It is like the side of a 
house. You will break your neck, my 
friend." 

Roldan said : " It is dangerous, but it 
could be done." 

" I can do it," said Rafael, proudly, 
"and I shall." 

The other boys, good sportsmen as they 



 

all were, shouted, " No ! no ! " again ; but 
Rafael laughed gaily, and forced his horse 
up the almost perpendicular declivity, l
eisurely unwinding his lariat from the high 
pommel of his saddle, and tossing it into 
big snake-like loops, which he gathered 
one by one into his hand, the last about 
his thumb. The bull fed on unsuspecting, 
for the early green of winter was very de 
licious after eight months of unrelenting 
sunshine. When Rafael reached the summit
he rode back for some distance, then 
came at the bull full charge, yelling like 
a demon. The bull, terrified and indig 
nant, gave a mighty snort and leaped over 
the brow of the hill. It was much like 
descending the slightly inclined side of a 
cliff, but he kept his footing. The boys 
held their breath as Rafael rode straight 
over the brow in the wake of the bull. 
With one hand he held the bridle in a 
tight grip, in the other he held aloft the 
coils of the lariat. It looked like a huge 
snake, and quivered as if aware that it was 
about to spring. There was no cheering; 
the boys were too much alarmed. A mis- 



 

step and there would be a hideous heap 
at the foot of the hill. 

The little mustang appeared scarcely to 
touch the uneven surface of the descent. 
He looked as if galloping in air, and 
tossed his head fiercely as though to shake 
the rising sun out of his eyes. The bull 
seemed continually gathering himself for 
a great leap, his clumsy bulk heaving from 
side to side. But a quarter of the distance 
had been traversed when the great curves 
of the lasso sprang forward, and, amidst a 
hoarse murmur from the boys, caught the 
bull below the horns. But that was all. 
The bull would not down ! There would 
be no coliar! He merely ran on the 
brute! the beast! jerking his horns 
defiantly, putting down his head, nearly 
dragging Rafael from the saddle. But 
no ! but no ! Rafael has risen in his saddle, 
he has forced his mustang the harder, he 
is almost level with the bull he has 
passed ! He gives a great jerk, dragging 
the bull to his knees, then another, and 
the bull is on his side and rolling over and 
over down the hill, Rafael following fast, 



 

slackening his lariat. The boys now cheer 
wildly, although danger is not over yes, 
in another moment it is, and Rafael, smiling
complacently, is at the foot of the hill, 
disengaging the humbled bull. 

" Bravo ! " said a voice from behind the 
horses. All turned with a start. It was 
the priest. " Coliar was never better 
done," he added graciously; and Rafael 
felt that the day was his. 

The priest had ridden up unnoted in 
the tense excitement of the last few mo 
ments. He sat a big powerful horse, and 
his bearing was as military as that of the 
two great generals of the Californias, 
Castro and Vallejo. 

As the boys, congratulations and modest 
acknowledgement over, were making for 
home and breakfast, the priest pressed his 
horse close to Roldan's. " I interested 
you much at the race yesterday, Don 
Roldan," he said, with a good-humoured 
smile. "Why was that?" 

Roldan was not often embarrassed, but 
he was so taken aback at the abrupt sally 
he forgot to be flattered-that the priest had 



 

evidently thought it worth while to inquire 
his name ; and stammered : " I well, you 
see, my father, you are not like other 
priests." Which was not undiplomatic. 

The priest smiled, this time with a faint 
flush of unmistakable pleasure. " You are 
right, my son, I am not as other priests in 
this wilderness. Would to Heaven I were, 
or " 

" Or that you were in Spain ? " Roldan 
could not resist saying, then caught his 
breath at his temerity. 

The priest turned about and faced him 
squarely. " Yes," he said deliberately, 
" and that I were a cardinal of Rome. 
Such words I have never uttered to mortal 
before; but if I am not as other men, neither 
are you as other lads. Some day you will 
be a Castro or an Alvarado; it is written 
in your face. Perhaps something more, 
for changes may come and your oppor 
tunities be greater. But I I am no 
longer young ; there is no hope in 
California for me." 

" Why do you not return to Spain ? " 

" I have written. They will not answer. 



 

In my youth I was wild. They forced 
me to come here. I had no money. I 
was obliged to obey. I have christianised 
a few hundred worthless savages who were 
better off in their barbarism, and I have 
made myself a power among a few thou 
sand men of whom the outer world, the 
great world, knows nothing. My Mission 
is the most prosperous in the Californias 
and I " he set and ground his teeth.
