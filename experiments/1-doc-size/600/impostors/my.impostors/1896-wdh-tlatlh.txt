He was not chosen into any of the nicer societies; 
those that he joined when he thought they were swell 
he could not care for when he found they were not. 

Westover came into a knowledge of the facts 
through his casual and scarcely voluntary confidences, 
and he pitied him somewhat while he blamed him a 
great deal more, without being able to help him at all. 
It appeared to him that the fellow had gone wrong 
more through ignorance than perversity, and that it 
was a stubbornness of spirit rather than a badness of 
heart that kept him from going right. He sometimes 
wondered whether it was not more a bafiied wish to be 
justified in his own esteem than anything else that 
made him overvalue the things he missed. He knew 
how such an experience as that with Mrs. Marven rank- 
les in the heart of youth, and will not cease to smart 
till some triumph in kind brings it ease ; but between 
the man of thirty and the boy of twenty there is a 
gulf fixed, and he could not ask. He did not know 



 

that a college man often goes wrong in his first year, 
out of no impulse that he can very clearly account for 
himself, and then when he ceases to be merely of his 
type and becomes more of his character, he pulls up 
and goes right. He did not know how much Jefi had 
been with a set that was fast without being fine. The 
boy had now and then a book in his hand when he 
came ; not always such a book as Westover could have 
wished, but still a book ; and to his occasional ques- 
tions about how he was getting on with his college 
work, JefE made brief answers, which gave the notion 
that he was not neglecting it. 

Towards the end of his first year he sent to West- 
over one night from a station-house, where he had 
been locked up for breaking a street-lamp in Boston. 
By his own showing he had not broken the lamp, or 
assisted, except through his presence, at the misdeed 
of the tipsy students who had done it. His breath 
betrayed that he had been drinking too ; but otherwise 
he seemed as sober as Westover himself, who did not 
know whether to augur well or ill for him from the 
proofs he had given before of his ability to carry ofE 
a bottle of wine with a perfectly level head. Jefi 
seemed to believe Westover a person of such influence 
that he could secure his release at once, and he was 
abashed to find that he must pass the night in the 
cell, where he conferred with Westover through the 
bars. 

In the police court, where his companions were 
fined, the next morning, he was discharged for want of 
evidence against him ; but the University authorities 



 

did not take the same view as the civil authorities. 
He was suspended, and for the time he passed out of 
Westover's sight and knowledge. 

He expected to find him at Lion's Head, where he 
went to pass the month of August — in painting those 
pictures of the mountain which had in some sort, al- 
most in spite of him, become his specialty. But Mrs. 
Durgin employed the first free moments after their 
meeting in explaining that JefE had got a chance to 
work his way to London on a cattle-steamer, and had 
been abroad the whole summer. He had written home 
that the voyage had been glorious, with plenty to eat 
and little to do ; and he had made favor with the cap- 
tain for his return by the same vessel in September. 
By other letters it seemed that he had spent the time 
mostly in England ; but he had crossed over into 
France for a fortnight, and had spent a week in Paris. 
His mother read some passages from his letters aloud 
to show Westover how JefE was keeping his eyes open. 
His accounts of his travel were a mixture of crude 
sensations in the presence of famous scenes and objects 
of interest, hard-headed observation of the facts of 
life, narrow-minded misconception of conditions, and 
wholly intelligent and adequate study of the art of inn- 
keeping in city and country. 

Mrs. Durgin seemed to feel that there was some 
excuse due for the relative quantity of the last. " He 
knows that's what I'd care for the most ; and Jeff a'n't 
one to forget his mother." As if the word reminded 
her, she added, after a moment, " We sha'n't any of 
us soon forget what you done for Jeff — that time." 




"I didn't do anything for him, Mrs. Durgin; I 
couldn't," Westover protested. 

" You done what you could, and I know that you 
saw the thing in the right light, or you wouldn't 'a' 
tried to do anything. Je£E told me every word about 
it. I know he was with a pretty harum-scarum crowd. 
But it was a lesson to him; and I wa'n't goin' to 
have him come back here, right away, and have folks 
talkin' about what they couldn't understand, after the 
way the paper had it." 

" Did it get into the papers ? " 

" Mm." Mrs. Durgin nodded. " And some dirty, 
sneakin' thing, here, wrote a letter to the paper and 
told a passel o' lies about Jeff, and all of us ; and the 
paper printed Jefi's picture with it : I don't know how 
they got a hold of it. So when he got that chance to 
go, I just said, ' Go.' You'll see he'll keep all straight 
enough after this, Mr. Westover." 

" Old woman read you any of Jefi's letters? " Whit- 
well asked, when his chance for private conference 
with Westover came. " What was the rights of that 
scrape he got into ? " 

Westover explained as favorably to Jefi as he could ; 
the worst of the affair was the bad company he was in. 

" Well, where there's smoke there's some fire. Cou't 
discharged him, and college suspended him. That's 
about where it is ? I guess he'll keep out o' harm's 
way, next time. Read you what he said about them 
scenes of the Revolution in Paris ? " 

"Yes; he seems to have looked it all up pretty 
thoroughly." 



 

" Done it for me, I guess, mucli as anything. I 
was always talkin' it up with him. Jefi's kep' his 
eyes open, that's a fact. He's got a head on him, 
more'n I ever thought." 

Westover decided that Mrs. Durgin's prepotent be- 
havior towards Mrs. Marven the summer before had 
not hurt her materially, with the witnesses even. 
There were many new boarders, but most of those 
whom he had already met were again at Lion's Head. 
They said there was no air like it ; and no place so 
comfortable. If they had sold their birthright for a 
mess of pottage, Westover had to confess that the 
pottage was very good. Instead of the Irish woman 
at ten dollars a week who had hitherto been Mrs. Dur- 
gin's cook, under her personal surveillance and direc- 
tion, she had now a man cook, whom she boldly called 
a fhef, and paid eighty dollars a month. He wore the 
white apron and white cap of his calling, but Westover 
heard him speak Yankee through his nose to one of 
the stablemen as they exchanged hilarities across the 
space between the basement and the barn door. 
"Yes," Mrs. Durgin admitted, "he's an American; 
and he learnt his trade at one of the best hotels in 
Portland. He's pretty headstrong, but I guess he 
does what he's told — in the end. The meanyous ? Oh, 
Franky Whitwell prints them. He's got an amature 
printing-oflBce in the stable-loft.''' 



XIV. 

One morning towards the end of August, Whit- 
well, who was starting homeward, after leaving his 
ladies, burdened with their wishes and charges for the 
morrow, met Westover coming up the hill with his 
painting-gear in his hand. " Say ! " he hailed him. 
" Why don't you come down to the house to-night ? 
Jackson's goin' to come, and if you ha'n't seen him 
work the plantchette for a spell, you'll be surprised. 
There a'n't hardly anybody he can't have up. ' You'll 
come ? Good enough ! " 

What afEected Westover first of all at the seance, 
and perhaps most of all, was the quality of the air in 
the little house ; it was close and stuffy, mixed with 
an odor of mould and an ancient smell of rats. The 
kerosene-lamp set in the centre of the table, where 
Jackson afterwards placed his planchette, devoured 
the little life that was left in it. At the gasps which 
Westover gave, with some despairing glances at the 
closed windows, Whitwell said : " Hot ? Well, I guess 
it is, a little. But you see Jackson has got to be care- 
ful about the night air ; but I guess I can fix it for 
you." He went out into the ell, and Westover heard 



 

him raising a window. He came back and asked, 
"That do? It'll get around in here, directly," and 
Westover had to profess relief. 

Jackson came in presently with the little Canuck, 
whom Whitwell presented to Westover: "Know Jom- 
bateeste ? " 

The two were talking about a landslide which had 
taken place on the other side of the mountain ; the 
news had just come that they had found among the 
ruins the body of the farm-hand who had been missing 
since the morning of the slide ; his funeral was to be 
the next day. 

Jackson put his planchette on the table, and sat 
down before it with a sigh ; the Canuck remained 
standing, and on foot he was scarcely a head higher 
than the seated Yankees. " Well," Jackson said, " I 
suppose he knows all about it now," meaning the dead 
farm-hand. 

" Yes," Westover suggested, " if he knows any- 
thing." 

" Know anything ! " Whitwell shouted. " Why, 
man ! Don't you believe he's as much alive as ever 
he was ? " 

" I hope so," said Westover, submissively. 

" Don't you knoiv it ? " 

" Not as I know other things. In fact, I donH know 
it," said Westover, and he was painfully aware of hav- 
ing shocked his hearers by the agnosticism so common 
among men in towns that he had confessed it quite 
simply and unconsciously. He perceived that faith 
in the soul and life everlasting was as quick as ever 



 

in the hills, whatever grotesque or unwonted form it 
wore. Jackson sat with closed eyes, and his head 
fallen back ; Whitwell stared at the painter, with open 
mouth ; the little Canuck began to walk up and down 
impatiently ; Westover felt a reproach, almost an ab- 
horrence, in all of them. 

Whitwell asked, " Why, don't you think there's any 
proof of it ? " 

"Proof? Oh, yes ! There's testimony enough to 
carry conviction to the stubbornest mind on any other 
point. But it's very strange about all that. It doesn't 
convince anybody but the witnesses. If a man tells 
me he's seen a disembodied spirit, I can't believe him. 
I must see the disembodied spirit myself." 

" That's something so," said Whitwell, with a re- 
lenting laugh. 

" If one came back from the dead, to tell us of a 
life beyond the grave, we should want the assurance 
that he'd really been dead, and not merely dreaming." 

Whitwell laughed again, in the delight the philo- 
sophic mind finds even in the reasoning that baffles it. 

The Canuck felt perhaps the simpler joy that the 
average man has in any strange notion that he is 
able to grasp. He stopped in his walk, and said, 
" Yes, and if you was dead, and went to heaven, and 
stayed so long you smelt, like Lazarus, and you come 
back and tol' 'em what you saw, nobody goin' believe 
you." 

" Well, I guess you're right there, Jombateeste," 
said Whitwell, with pleasure in the Canuck's point. 
After a moment he suggested to Westover, " Then I 



 

s'pose if you feel the way you do, you don't care much 
about plantchette ? " 

"Oh, yes, I do," said the painter. "We never 
know when we may be upon the point of revelation. 
I wouldn't miss any chance." 

Whether Whitwell felt an ironic slant in the words 
or not, he paused a moment before he said, " Want 
to start her up, Jackson ? " 

Jackson brought to the floor the fore feet of his 
chair, which he had tilted from it in leaning back, and 
without other answer put his hand on the planchette. 
It began to fly over the large sheet of paper spread 
upon the table, in curves and angles and eccentrics. 

" Feels pootty lively to-night," said Whitwell, with 
a glance at Westover. 

The little Canuck, as if he had now no further con- 
cern in the matter, sat down in a corner and smoked 
silently. Whitwell asked, after a moment's impatience, 
" Can't you git her down to business, Jackson ? " 

Jackson gasped, " She'll come down when she wants 
to." 

The little instrument seemed, in fact, trying to con- 
trol itself. Its movements became less wild and large ; 
the zigzags began to shape themselves into something 
like characters. Jackson's wasted face gave no token 
of interest ; Whitwell laid half his gaunt length across 
the table in the endeavor to make out some meaning 
in them ; the Canuck, with his hands crossed on his 
stomach, smoked on, with the same gleam in his pipe 
and eye. 

The planchette suddenly stood motionless. 



 

" She done ? " murmured Whitwell. 

" I guess she is, for a spell, anyway," said Jackson, 
wearily. 

" Let's try to make out what she says." Whitwell 
drew the sheet towards himself and Westover, who sat 
next him. " You've got to look for the letters every- 
where. Sometimes she'll give you fair and square 
writin', and then again she'll slat the letters down every 
which way, and you've got to hunt 'em out for your- 
self. Here's a B I've got. That begins along pretty 
early in the alphabet. Let's see what we can find next." 

"Westover fancied he could make out an F and a T ; 
Whitwell exulted in an unmistakable K and N ; and he 
made sure of an E and an E. The painter was not so 
sure of an S. " Well, call it an S," said Whitwell. 
" And I guess I've got an O here, and an H. Hello ! 
Here's an A, as large as life. Pootty much of a mixt- 
ure." 

" Yes ; I don't see that we're much better ofi than 
we were before," said Westover. 

" Well, I don't know about that," said Whitwell. 
" Write 'em down in a row, and see if we can't pick 
out some sense. I've had worse finds than this ; no 
vowels at all sometimes; but here's three." 

He wrote the letters down, while Jackson leaned 
back against the wall, in patient quiet. 

" Well, sir," said Whitwell, pushing the paper, 
where he had written the letters in a line, to West- 
over, " make anything out of 'em ? " 

Westover struggled with them a moment. " I can 
make out one word, shaft." 



 

" Anything else ? " demanded Whitwell, with a 
glance of triumph at Jackson. 

Westover studied the remaining letters. " Yes, I 
get one other word : broken." 

" Just what I done ! But I wanted you to speak 
first. It's Broken Shaft. Jackson, she caught right 
on to what we was talkin' about. This life," he turned 
to Westover, in solemn exegesis, " is a broken shaft, 
when death comes. It rests upon the earth, but you 
got to look for the top of it in the skies. That's the 
way I look at it. What do you think, Jackson ? Jom- 
bateeste ? " 

" Me, I think anybody can't see that, better go and 
get some heye-glass." 

Westover remained in a shameful minority. He 
said, meekly, " It suggests a beautiful hope." 

Jackson brought his chair legs down again, and put 
his hand on the planchette. 

" Feel that tinglin' ? " asked Whitwell, and Jackson 
made yes, with silent lips. " After he's been workin' 
the plantchette for a spell, and then leaves off, and she 
wants to say something more," Whitwell explained to 
Westover, " he seems to feel a kind of tinglin' in his 
arm, as if it was asleep, and then he's got to tackle 
her again. Writin' steady enough, now, Jackson ! " 
he cried, joyously. " Let's see ! " He leaned over 
and read, " Thomas Jefferson — " The planchette 
stopped. " My, I didn't go to do that," said Whit- 
well, apologetically. " You much acquainted with 
JefEerson's writin's? " he asked of Westover. 

The painter had to own his ignorance of all except 



 

the dictum that the government is best which governs 
least; but he was not in a position to deny that Jeffer- 
son had ever said anything about a broken shaft. 

" It may have come to him on the other side," said 
Whitwell. 

" Perhaps," Westover assented. 

The planchette began to stir itself again. " She's 
goin' ahead ! " cried Whitwell. He leaned over the 
table so as to get every letter as it was formed. " D — 
Yes ! Death. Death is the Broken Shaft. Go on !" 
After a moment of faltering the planchette formed 
another letter. It was a U, and it was followed by an 
R, and so on, till Durgin had been spelled. — " Thun- 
der ! " cried Whitwell. " If any thing's happened to 
Jefi ! " 

Jackson lifted his hand from the planchette. 

" Oh, go on, Jackson ! " Whitwell entreated. " Don't 
leave it so ! " 

" I can't seem to go on," Jackson whispered, and 
Westover could not resist the fear that suddenly rose 
among them. But he made the first struggle against 
it. " This is nonsense. Or if there's any sense in it, 
it means that Jeff's ship has broken her shaft, and put 
back." 

Whitwell gave a loud laugh of relief. " That's so ! 
You've hit it, Mr. Westover." 

Jackson said, quietly : " He didn't mean to start 
home till to-morrow. And how could he send any 
message unless he was — " 

" Easily ! " cried Westover. " It's simply an instance 
of mental impression — of telepathy, as they call it." 

 

" That's so! " shouted Whitwell, with eager and in- 
stant conviction. 

Westover could see that Jackson still doubted. " If 
you believe that a disembodied spirit can communicate 
with you, why not an embodied spirit ? If anything 
has happened to your brother's ship, his mind would 
be strongly on you at home, and why couldn't it con- 
vey its thought to you ? " 

" Because he ha'n't started yet," said Jackson. 

Westover wanted to laugh ; but they all heard voices 
without, which seemed to be coming nearer, and he 
listened with the rest. He made out Frank Whitwell's 
voice, and his sister's ; and then another voice, louder 
and gayer, rose boisterously above them. Whitwell 
flung the door open and plunged out into the night. 
He came back, hauling JefE Durgin in by the shoul- 
der. 

" Here, now," he shouted to Jackson, " you just let 
this feller and plantchette fight it out together ! " 

" What's the matter with plantchette ? " said Jeff, 
before he said to his brother, " Hello, Jackson," and 
to the Canuck, " Hello, Jombateeste." He shook 
hands conventionally with them both, and then with 
the painter, whom he greeted with greater interest. 
" Glad to see yow, here, Mr. Westover. Did I take 
you by surprise ? " he asked of the company at large. 

" No, sir," said Whitwell. " Didn't surprise us any 
if you are a fortnight ahead of time," he added, with 
a wink at the others. 

" Well, I took a notion I wouldn't wait for the cat- 
tle-ship, and I started back on a French boat. Thought 



 

I'd try it. They live well. But I hoped I should 
astonish you a little, too. I might as well waited." 

Whitwell laughed. " We heard from you — plant- 
chette kept right round after you." 

" That so ? " asked Jeff, carelessly. 

" Fact. Have a good voyage I " Whitwell had the 
air of putting a casual question. 

" First rate," said Jeff. " Plantchette say not ?" 

" No. Only about the broken shaft." 

" Broken shaft ? We didn't have any broken shaft ! 
Plantchette's got mixed a little. Got the wrong ship." 

After a moment of chopfallenness, Whitwell said : 
" Then somebody been makin' free with your name. 
Curious how them devils cut up oftentimes." 

He explained, and Jeff laughed uproariously, when 
he understood the whole case. " Plantchette's been 
havin' fun with you." 

Whitwell gave himself time for reflection. " No, 
sir, I don't look at it that way. I guess the wires got 
crossed, some way. If there's such a thing as the 
spirits o' the livin' influencin' plantchette, accordin' to 
Mr. Westover's say, here, I don't see why it wa'n't 
Jeff's being so near that got control of her, and made 
her sign his name to somebody else's words. It shows 
there's something in it." 

" Well, I'm glad to come back alive, anyway," said 
Jeff, with a joviality new to Westover. " I tell you, 
there a'n't many places finer than old Lion's Head, 
after all. Don't you think so, Mr. Westover ? I want 
to get the daylight on it, but it does well by moon- 
light, even." He looked round at the tall girl, who 




had been lingering to hear the talk of planchette ; at 
the backward tilt he gave his head, to get her in range, 
she frowned as if she felt his words a betrayal, and 
slipped out of the room ; the boy had already gone, and 
was making himself heard in the low room overhead. 
"There's a lot of folks here, this summer, mother 
says," he appealed from the check he had got to Jack- 
son. " Every room taken, for the whole month, she 



" We've been pretty full all July, too," said Jack- 
son, blankly. 

"Well, it's a great business; and I've picked up a 
lot of hints, over there. We're not so smart as we 
think we are. The Swiss can teach us a thing or two. 
They know how to keep a hotel." 

"Go to Switzerland?" asked Whitwell. 

" I slipped over into the edge of it." 

" I want to know ! Well, now them Alps, now : 
they so much bigger'n the White Hills, after all ? " 

" Well, I don't know about all of 'em," said Jeff. 
" There may be some that vrould compare with our 
hills, but I should say that you could take Mount 
Washington up and set it in the lap of almost any one 
of the Alps I saw, and it would look like a baby on 
its mother's knee." 

" I want to know ! " said Whitwell again. His tone 
expressed disappointment, but impartiality ; he would 
do justice to foreign superiority if he must. " And 
about the ocean. What about waves runnin' mountains 
high?" 

" Well, we didn't have it very rough. But I don't 




believe I saw any waves mucli higlier than Lion's 
Head." Jeff laughed to find Whitwell taking him 
seriously. " Won't that satisfy you ? "
