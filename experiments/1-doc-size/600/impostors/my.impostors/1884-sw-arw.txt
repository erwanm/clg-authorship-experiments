"Really," said Mr. Dallas, without ceasing his 
contemplation of the page before him, " I do not 
know. I have not considered the matter lately." 

"Do you remember he is eighteen?" 

"I thought you were not ready to let him go 
yet ? " 

Mrs. Dalla's stopped her embroidery and sighed. 

"But he must go, husband." 

Mr. Dallas made no answer. He seemed not to 
find the question pressing. Mrs. Dallas sat looking at him now, neglecting her work. 

" You have got to make up your mind to it, and 
so have I," she went on presently. " He is ready 
for college. All this pottering over the classics with 



 

Col. Gainsborough don't amount to anything. It 
keeps him out of idleness if Pitt ever could be 
idle but he has got to go to college after all, 
sooner or later. He must go ! " she repeated with 
another sigh. 

* No special hurry, that I see." 

"What's gained by delay? He's eighteen. That's 
long enough for him to have lived in a place like this. 
If I had my way, Hildebrand, I should send him 
to England." 

" England ! " Mr. Dallas put down his paper 
now and looked at his wife. What had got into 
her head ? 

" Oxford is better than the things they call colleges in this country." 

"Yes; but it is further off." 

"That's not a bad thing, in some respects. Hildebrand, you don't want Pitt to be formed upon 
the model of things in this country. You would 
not have him get radical ideas, or Puritanical." 

" Not much danger ! " 

"I don't know." 

"Who's to put them in his head? Gainsborough 
is not a bit of a radical." 

"He is not one of us," said Mrs. Dallas. "And 
Pitt is very independent and takes his own views, 
from nobody or from anybody. See his educating 
this girl, now ! " 

" Educating her ! " 

" Yes, he is with her and her father a great piece 
of every day ; reading and talking and walking and 





drying flowers and giving lessons. I don't know 
what all they are doing. But in my opinion Pitt 
might be better employed." 

"That won't last," said the father with a half 
laugh. 

" What ought not to last, had better not be begun," Mrs. Dallas said sententiously. 

There was a pause. 

" What are you afraid of, wife ? " 

" I am afraid of Pitt's wasting his time." 

"You have never been willing to have him go, 
until now. I thought you stood in the way." 

" He was not wasting his time, until lately. He 
was as well at home. But there must come an end 
to that," the mother said with another slight sigh. 
She was not a woman given to sighing; it meant 
much from her. 

"But England ? "said Mr. Dallas. "What's 
your notion about England ? Oxford is very well, 
but the ocean lies between." 

" Where would you send him ? " 

"I'd send him to the best there is on this side." 

" That's not Oxford. I believe it would be good 
for him to be out of this country for awhile ; forget 
some of his American notions and get right English 
ones. Pitt is a little too independent." 

The elder Dallas caressed his whiskers and pondered. If the truth were told, he had been about 
as unwilling to let his son go away from home as 
ever his mother could be. Pitt was simply the delight and pride of both theirvhearts; the one thing 



 

they lived for; the centre of all hopes, and the end 
of all undertakings. No doubt he must go to college ; but the evil day had been pushed far off, as 
far as possible. Pitt was a son for parents to be 
proud of. He had the good qualities of both father and mother, with some added of his own 
which they did not share, and which perhaps 
therefore increased their interest in him. 

" I expect he will have a word to say about the 
matter himself," the father remarked. " well ! 
there's no raging hurry, wife." 

" Husband, it would be a good thing for him to 
see the English church as it is in England, before 
he gets much older." 

" What then ? " 

" He would learn to value it. The cathedrals, 
and the noble services in them, and the bishops; 
and the feeling that everybody around him goes 
the same way; there's a great deal of power in 
that. Pitt would be impressed by it." 

" By the feeling that everybody around him goes 
that way ? Not he. That's quite as likely to stir 
him up to go another way." 

"It don't work so, Hildebrand." 

"You think he's a likely fellow to be talked over 
into anything ? " 

"No ; but he would be influenced. Nobody would 
try to talk him over, and without knowing it he 
would feel the influence. He couldn't help it. 
All the influence at Oxford would be the right 
way." 





"Afraid of the colonel? I don't think you need. 
He hasn't spirit enough left in him for proselyting." 

I am not speaking of anybody in particular. I 
am afraid of the air here." 

Mr. Dallas laughed a little, but his face took a 
shade of gravity it had not worn. Must he send 
his son away? What would the house be with 
out him ? 



CHAPTER VI. 
GOING TO COLLEGE. 

WHATEVER thoughts were harboured in the 
elder heads, nothing was spoken openly 
and no steps were taken for some time. All 
through the summer the pleasant intercourse went 
on, and the lessons, and the botanizing, and the 
study of coins. And much real work was done; 
but for Esther one invaluable and abiding effect of 
a more general character was gained. She was 
lifted out of her dull despondency, which had 
threatened to become stagnation, and restored to 
her natural life and energy and the fresh spring of 
youthful spirits. So when her friend really went 
away to college in the fall, Esther did not slip back 
to the condition from which he had delivered her. 
But the loss of him was a dreadful loss to the 
child, although Pitt was not going over the sea, 
and would be home at Christmas. He tried to comfort her with this prospect. Esther took no comfort. 
She sat silent, tearless, pale, in a kind of despair. 
Pitt looked at her, half amused, half deeply concerned. 





" And you must go on with all your studies, Esther, you know," he was saying. " I will shew you 
what to do; and when I come home I shall go into 
a very searching examination to see whether you 
have done it all thoroughly." 

" Will you ? " she said, lifting her eyes to him 
with a gleam of sudden hope. 

" Certainly ! I shall give you lessons just as 
usual whenever I come home; indeed I expect I 
shall do it all your life. I think I shall always be 
teaching and you always be learning. Don't you 
think that is how it will be, Queen Esther ? " he 
said kindly. 

"You cannot give me lessons when you are 
away." 

" But when I come back ! " 

There was a very faint yet distinct lightening of 
the gloom in her face. Yet it was plain Esther was 
not cheated out of her perception of the truth. She 
was going to lose her friend; and his absence would 
be very different from his presence ; and the bits 
of vacation time would not help, or help only by an 
ticipation, the long stretches of months in which 
there would be neither sight nor sound of him. 
Esther's looks had brightened for a moment, but 
then her countenance fell again and her face grew 
visibly pale. Pitt saw it with dismay. 

" But Esther ! " he said, " this is nothing. Every 
man must go to college, you know, just as he must 
learn swimming and boating; and so I must go; 
but it will not last forever." 



 

" How long ? " said she, lifting her eyes to him 
again, heavy with their burden of sorrow. 

" Well, perhaps three years; unless I enter Junior, 
and then it would be only two. That isn't much." 

" What will you do then ? " 

"Then? I don't know. Look after you, at any 
rate. Let us see. How old will you be in two 
years ? " 

"Almost fourteen." 

" Fourteen. Well, you see you will have a great 
deal to do, before you can afford to be fourteen years 
old; so much that you will not have time to miss 
me." 

Esther made no answer. 

"I'll be back at Christmas anyhow, you know; 
and that's only three months away, or a little more." 

"For how long?" 

" Never mind; we will make a little do the work 
of a great deal. It will seem a long time, it will 
be so good." 

"No," said Esther; "that will make it only the 
shorter." 

" Why Esther," said he half laughing, " I didn't 
know you cared so much about me. I don't deserve 
all that." 

" I am not crying," said the girl, rising with a 
sort of childish dignity; "but I shall be alone." 

They had been sitting on a rock, resting and 
talking, and now set out again to go home. Esther 
spoke no more ; and Pitt was silent, not knowing 
what to say; but he watched her, and saw that if 





she had not been crying at the time she had made 
that declaration, the tears had taken their revenge 
and were coming now. Yet only in a calm, repressed way; now and then he saw a drop fall, 
or caught a motion of Esther's hand which could 
only have been made to prevent a drop from fall 
ing. She walked along steadily, turning neither to 
the right hand or the left; she who ordinarily 
watched every hedgerow and ran to explore every 
group of plants in the corner of a field, and was 
keen to see everything that was to be seen in 
earth or heaven. Pitt walked along silently too. 
He was at a careless age, but he was a generous 
minded fellow; and to a mind of that sort there is 
something exceedingly attractive and an influence 
exceedingly powerful in the fact of being trusted 
and depended on. 

" Mother," he said when he got home, " I wish 
you would look after that little girl now and then." 

" What little girl V " 

"You must know whom I mean; the colonel's 
daughter." 

" The colonel is sufficient for that, I should say." 

" But you know what sort of a man he is. And 
she has no mother, nor anybody else, except 
servants." 

"Isn't he fond of her?" 

"Very fond; but then he isn't well, and he is a 
reserved, silent man; the child is left to herself in 
a way that is bad for her." 

" What do you suppose I can do ? " 



 

" A great deal ; if you once knew her and got 
fond of her, mother." 

Mrs. Dallas made no promise; however she did 
go to see Esther. It was about a week after Pitt's 
departure. She found father and daughter very 
much as her son had found them the day he was 
introduced to the box of coins. Esther was on the 
floor, beside the same box, and the colonel was on 
his sofa. Mrs. Dallas did take the effect of the 
picture for that moment before the colonel sprang 
up to receive her. Then she had to do with a 
somewhat formal but courtly host, and the picture 
was lost. The lady sat there, stately in her silks 
and laces, carrying on a stiff conversation ; for she 
and Col. Gainsborough had few points of sympathy 
or mutual understanding; and for awhile she forgot 
Esther. Then her eye again fell upon the child in 
her corner, sitting by her box with a sad, uninterested air. 

"And how is Esther?" she said, turning herself 
a little towards that end of the room. " Eeally I 
came to see Esther, colonel. How does she do ? " 

"She is much obliged to you, and quite well, 
madam, I believe." 

" But she must want playmates, colonel. Why 
don't you send her to school ? " 

" I would, if there were a good school at hand." 

"There are schools at New Haven, and Hartford, 
and Boston; plenty of schools, that would suit 
you." 

" Only, that, as you observe, they are at New 





Haven, and Hartford, and Boston; out of my 
reach." 

" You couldn't do without her for awhile ? " 

" I hardly think it; nor she without me. We are 
all, each of us, that the other has." 

" Pitt used to give you lessons, didn't he?" the 
lady went on, turning more decidedly to Esther. 
Esther rose and came near. 

"Yes, ma 'am." 

"What did he teach you?" 

Now Esther felt no more congeniality than her 
father did with this handsome, stately, command 
ing woman. Yet it would have been impossible to 
the girl to say why she had an instant unwilling 
ness to answer this simple question. She did not 
answer it, except under protest. 

"It began with the coins," she said vaguely. 
" He said we would study history with them." 

"And did you?" 

" Yes, ma 'am." 

"How did you manage it? or how did he? he 
has original ways of doing things." 

" Yes, ma 'am. We used to take only one or two 
of the coins at once, and then Pitt told me what to 
read." 

" What did he tell you to read ? " 

"A great many different books, at different 
times." 

"But tell Mrs. Dallas what books, Esther," her 
father put in. 

" There were so many, papa. Gibbon's history, 



 

and Plutarch's Lives, and Rollin, and Yertot 
and Hume, and I forget some of them." 

"How much of all these did you really read, 
Esther ? " 

"I don't know, ma 'am. I read what he told 
me." 

The lady turned to Col. Gainsborough with a peculiar smile. " Sounds rather heterogeneous ! " 
she said. 

It was on Esther's lips to justify her teacher, and 
say how far from heterogeneous, how connected, and 
how thorough, and how methodical, the reading 
and the study had been; and how enriched with 
talk and explanations and descriptions , and discussions. How delightful those conversations were, 
both to herself and Pitt; how living the truth had 
been made; how had names and facts taken on 
them the shape and colouring of nature and reality. It rushed back upon Esther, and her lips 
opened; and then, an inexplicable feeling of some 
thing like caution came down upon her, and she 
shut her lips again. 

"It was harmless amusement," remarked the 
colonel carelessly. 

Whether the mother thought that, may be questioned. She looked again at the child standing 
before her; a child truly, with childlike innocence 
and ignorance in her large eyes and pure lips. But 
the eyes were eyes of beauty; and the lips would 
soon and readily take to themselves the sweetness 
and the consciousness of womanhood, and a new 





bloom would come upon the cheek. The colonel 
had never yet looked forward to all that; but the 
wise eyes of the matron saw it as well as if already 
before her. This little girl might well by and by 
be dangerous. If Mrs. Dallas had come as a friend, 
she went away, in a sort, as an enemy. In so far 
at least as Esther's further and future relations with 
her son were concerned. 

The colonel went back to his sofa. Esther sat 
down again by the coins. She was not quite old 
enough to reflect much upon the developments of 
human nature as they came before her; but she 
was conscious of a disagreeable, troubled sensation 
left by this visit of Mrs. Dallas. It had not been 
pleasant. It ought to have been pleasant; she 
was Pitt's mother; she came on a kind errand; but 
Esther felt at once repelled and put at a distance. 

The child had not gone back to the dull despondency of the time before Pitt busied himself 
with her; she was striving to fulfil all his wishes, 
and working hard in order to accomplish more than 
he expected of her. With the cherished secret 
hope of doing this, Esther was driving at her books 
early and late. She went from the coins to the 
histories Pitt had told her would illustrate them ; 
she fagged away at the dry details of her Latin 
grammar; she even tried to push her knowledge 
of plants and see further into their relations with 
each other, though in this department she felt the 
want of her teacher particularly. From day to day 
it was the one pressing desire and purpose in 



 

Esther's mind, to do more and if possible much 
more than Pitt wanted her to do ; so that she might 
surprise him and win his respect and approbation. 
She thought, too, that she was in a fair way to do 
this, for she was gaining knowledge fast, she 
knew; and it was a great help towards keeping up 
spirit and hope and healthy action in her mind. 
Nevertheless she missed her companion and friend, 
with an intense longing want of him which no 
body even guessed. All the more keen it was, 
perhaps, because she could speak of it to nobody. 
It consumed the girl in secret, and was only saved 
from being disastrous to her by the transformation 
of it into working energy, which transformation 
daily went on anew. It did not help her much, or 
she thought so, to remember that Pitt was coming 
home at the end of December. He would not stay ; 
and Esther was one of those thoughtful natures 
that look all round a subject, and are not deceived 
by a first fair show. He could not stay; and what 
would his coming and the delight of it do, after 
all, but renew this terrible sense of want and make 
it worse than ever ? When he went away again, it 
would be for a long, long time; an absence of 
months; how was it going to be borne? 

The problem of life was beginning early for Esther. And the child was alone. Nobody knew 
what went on in her; she had nobody to whom she 
could open her heart and tell her trouble ; and the 
troubles we can tell to nobody else somehow weigh 
very heavy, especially in young years. The colonel 





loved his child with all of his heart that was not 
buried in his wife's grave ; still, he was a man, and 
like most men had little understanding of the 
workings of a child's mind, above all of a girl's, 
He saw Esther pale, thoughtful, silent, grave, for 
ever busy with her books; and it never crossed his 
thoughts that such is not the natural condition and 
wholesome manner of life for twelve years old. He 
knew nothing for himself so good as books; why 
should not the same be true for Esther ? She was 
a studious child ; he was glad to see her so sensible. 
As for Pitt, he had fallen upon a new world, and 
was busily finding his feet, as it were. Finding his 
own place, among all these other aspirants for human distinction; testing his own strength, among 
the combatants in this wrestling school of human 
life; earning his laurels in the race for learning, 
making good his standing and trying his power 
amid the waves and currents of human influence. 
Pitt found his standing good, and his strength 
quite equal to the call for it, and his power dominating. At least it would have been dominating, if 
he had cared to rule; all he cared for, as it hap 
pened, in that line, was to be independent and keep 
his own course. He had done that always at home, 
and he found no difficulty in doing it at college. 
For the rest, his abilities were unquestioned and 
put him at once at the head of his fellows. 



CHAPTER VII. 

COMING HOME. 

WITHOUT being at all an unfaithful friend, it 
must be confessed Pitt's mind during this 
time was full of the things pertaining to his own 
new life, and he thought little of Esther. He 
thought little of anybody; he was not at a sentimental age, nor at all of a sentimental disposition, 
and he had enough else to occupy him. It was not 
till he had put the college behind him and was on 
his journey home, that Esther's image rose before 
his mental vision ; the first time perhaps for months. 
It smote him then with a little feeling of compunction. He recollected the child's sensitive nature, 
her clinging to him, her lonely condition; and the 
grave, sad eyes seemed to reproach him with having forgotten her. He had not forgotten her; he 
had only not remembered. He might have taken 
time to write her one little letter; but he had not 
thought of it. Had she ceased to think of him, in 
any corresponding way? Pitt was very sure she 
had not. Somehow his fancy was very busy with 
Esther during this ride home. He was making 



amends for months of neglect. Her delicate, tender, faithful image seemed to stand before him ; 
forgetf ulness would never be charged upon Esther, 
nor carelessness, of anything she ought to care for; 
of that he was sure. He was quite ashamed of 
himself, that he had sent her never a little token 
of remembrance in all this time. He recalled the 
girl's eagerness in study, her delight in learning, 
her modest, well-bred manner; her evident though 
unconscious loving devotion to himself, and her 
profound grief at his going away. There were 
very noble qualities in that young girl, that would
