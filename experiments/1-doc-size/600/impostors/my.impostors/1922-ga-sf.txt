him again. He was installed in his room, 
two powerful nurses attended him day and 
night, and Holt slept on a cot near the bed. 
He was almost ungovernable at first, in spite 
of the drugs the doctor gave him, but these had 
their effect in time 5 and then the tapering-off 
process began, combined with hotly peppered 
soups and the vegetable most inimical to 
alcohol J finally food in increasing quantity to 
restore his depleted vitality. In his first sane 
moment he had made Holt promise that Madeleine should not see him, and she had sent word 
that she would wait until he sent for her. 

Madeleine took long walks, and drives, and 
read in the Astor Library. She also replenished 
her wardrobe. The color came back to her 
cheeks, the sparkle to her eyes. She had made 
all her plans. The house in Virginia was being 
renovated. She would take him there as soon 



 

as he could be moved. When he was strong 
again he would start his newspaper. Holt and 
Lacey were as overjoyed at the prospect of 
being his. assistant editors as at the almost unbelievable rescue of Langdon Masters. 

He had remained in bed after the worst was 
over, simk in torpor, with no desire to leave it 
or to live. But strength gradually returned to 
his wasted frame, the day nurse was dismissed, 
and he appeared to listen when Holt talked to 
him, although he would not reply. One day, 
however, when he believed himself to be alone, 
he opened his eyes and stared at the wall covered 
with his books, as he had done before through 
half -closed lids. Then his gaze wandered to 
the green curtains. But his mind was clear. 
He was visited by no delusions. This was not 
the Occidental Hotel. 

It was long since he had read a book! He 
wondered, with his first symptom of returning 
interest in life, if he was strong enough to cross 
the room and find one of his favorite volumes. 
But as he raised himself on his elbow Holt bent 
over him. 

" What is it, old fellow? '' 

" Those books? How did they get here? '' 



 

^ Lacey brought them. You remember, you 
left them in the Times cellar." 
" Are these your rooms?'' 
" No, they are Madeleine Talbot's." 
He made no reply, but he did not scowl and 
turn his back as he had done whenever Holt 
had tentatively mentioned her name before. 
The sight of his familiar beloved books had 
softened his harsh spirit, and the hideous chasm 
between his present and his past seemed visibly 
shrinking. His tones, however, had not soft- 
ened when he asked curtly after a moment : 

"What is the meaning of it all? Why is 
she here? Is Talbot dead?" 
" No, he divorced her." 
" Divorced her? Madeleine?" He almost 
sat upright. Mrs. Abbott could not have 
looked more horrified. " Is this some infernal 
joke?" 

" Are you strong enough to hear the whole 
story? I warn you it isn't a pretty one. But 
I've promised her I would tell you — " 
" What did he divorce her for?" 
" Desertion. There was worse behind." 
" Do you mean to tell me there was another 
man? I'll break yoiu- neck." 




^ There was no other man. Pll give you a 
few drops of digitalis, although you must have 
the heart of an ox — '' 

" Give me a drink. Pm sick of your damn 
physic. Don't worry. Pm out of that, and I 
shan't go back.'' 

Holt poured him out a small quantity of old 
Bourbon and diluted it with water. Masters 
regarded it with a look of scorn but tossed it off. 

" What was the worse behind?" 

"When she heard what had become of 
you — she got it out of me — she deliberately 
made a drunkard of herself. She became the 
scandal of the town. She was cast out, neck and 
crop. Every friend she ever had cut her, 
avoided her as if she were a leper. She left 
the doctor and lived by herself in one room on 
the Plaza. I met her again in one of the worst 
dives in San Francisco — " 

"Stop!'' Masters' voice rose to a scream. 
He tried to get out of bed but fell back on the 
pillows. " You are a liar — you — you — " 

"You shall listen whether you relish the 
facts or not. I have given her my promise." 
And he told the story in all its abominable details, sparing the writhing man on the bed nothing. He drew upon his imagination for scenes 
between Madeleine and the doctor, of whose 
' misery he gave a harrowing picture. He described the episode on the boat after her drinking bout at Blazes', of the futile attempts of 
Sally Abbott and Talbot to cure her. He gave 
graphic and hideous pictures of the dives she 
had frequented alone, the rid^ she had run in 
the most vicious resorts on Barbary Coast. Not 
until he had seared Masters' brain indelibly 
did he pass to Madeleine's gradual rise from 
her depths, the restoration of her beauty and 
charm and sanity. It was when she was almost 
herself again that Talbot had offered to forgive 
her and take her to Europe to live, offering 
divorce as the alternative. 

" Of course she accepted the divorce," Holt 
concluded. "That meant freedom to go to 
you." 

Masters had grown calm by degrees. "I 
should never have dreamed even Madeleine 
was capable of that," he said. "And there 
was a time when I believed there was no height 
to which she could not soar. She is a great 
woman and a great lover, and I am no more 
worthy of her now than I was in that sink 




where you found me. Nor ever shall be. Go 
out and bring in a barber." 

Holt laughed. " At least you are yourself 
again and I f anqr she'll ask no more than that. 
Shall I tell her you will see her in an hour?" 

" Yes, I'll see her. God! What a woman." 



XLVI 

MADELEINE made her toUette with 
trembling hands, nevertheless with no 
detail neglected. Her beautiful chestnut hair 
was softly parted and arranged in a mass of 
graceful curls at the back of the head. She 
wore a house-gown of white muslin sprigged 
with violets, and a long Marie Antoinette figure, 
pale green and diaphanous. Where it crossed 
she fastened a bunch of violets. She looked 
like a vision of spring, a grateful vision for a 
sick room. 

When Holt tapped on her door on his way 
out the second time, muttering charactdristi- 
cally : " Coast clear. All serene," she walked 
down the hall with nothing of the primitive 
fierce courage she had exhibited in Five Points. 
She was terrified at the ordeal before her, 
afraid of appearing sentimental and silly j that 
he would find her less beautiful than his 
memory of her, or gone off and no longer de- 


 

sirable. What if he should die suddenly? 
Holt had told her of his agitation. This visit 
should have been postponed until he had slept 
and recuperated. She had sent him word to 
that effect but he had replied that he had no 
intention of waiting. 

She stood still for a few moments until she 
felt calmer, then txmied the knob of Masters' 
door and walked in. 

He was sitting propped up in bed and she had 
an agreeable shock of surprise. In spite of all 
efforts of will her imagination had persisted in 
picturing him with a violent red face and red 
injected eyes, a loose sardonic mouth and lines 
like scars. His face was very pale, his eyes 
clear and bright, his hair trimmed in its old 
dose fashion, his mouth grimly set. Although 
he was very thin the lines in his cheeks were less 
pronounced. He looked years older, of course, 
and the life he had led had set its indelible seal 
upon him, but he was Langdon Masters again 
nevertheless. 

His eyes dilated when he saw her, but he 
smiled whimsically. 

" So you want what is left of this battered 
old husk, Madeleine?" he asked. " You in the 



 

prime of your beauty and your youth! Better 
think it over." 

She smiled a little, too. 
"Do you mean that?" 
" No, I don't! Come here! Come here! » 



XLVII 

IN THE winter of 1878-79 Mrs. Ballinger 
gave a luncheon in honor of Mrs. McLane, 
who had arrived in San Francisco the day before 
after a long visit in Europe. The city was 
growing toward the west, but Ballinger House 
still looked like an outpost on its solitary hill 
and was almost siurounded by a grove of 
eucalyptus trees. 

Mrs. Abbott grumbled as she always did at 
the long joiu*ney, skirting far higher hills, and 
through sand dunes still unsubdued by man and 
awaiting the first dry wind of summer to transform themselves into clouds of dust. But a 
sand storm would not have kept her away. 
The others invited were her daughter-in-law, 
who had met Mrs. McLane at Sacramento, 
Guadalupe Hathaway, now Mrs. Ogden Bascom, Mrs. Montgomery, Mrs. Yorba, whose 
husband had recently built the largest and 
ugliest house in San Francisco, perched aloft 
on Nob Hill several more of Mrs. McLatie's 



 

favorites, old and young, and Maria Groome, 
bom Ballinger, now a proud pillar of San 
Francisco Society. 

The dining-room of Ballinger House was 
long and narrow and from its bow window 
conmianded a view of the Bay. It was as uncomely with its black walnut furniture and 
brown walls as the rest of that aristocratic abode, 
across whose threshold no loose fish had ever 
darted} but its dingy walls were more or less 
concealed by pdntings of the martial Virginia 
ancestors of Mrs. Ballinger and her husband, 
the table linen had been woven for her in Ireland, the cut glass blown for her in England; 
the fragile china came from Sevres, and the 
massive silver had travelled from England to 
Virginia in the reign of Elizabeth. The room 
may have been ugly, nay, ponderous, but it had 
an air! 

The women who graced the board were 
dressed, with one or two exceptions, in the 
height of the mode. Save Maria Groome each 
had made at least one trip to Europe and left her 
measurements with Worth. Maria did not 
begin her pilgrimages to Europe until the 
eighties, and then it was old carved furniture 



 

she brought home; dress she always held in disdain, possibly because her husband's mistresses 
were ever attired in the excess of the fashion. 

Mrs. Ballinger was now in her fifties but still 
one of the most beautiful women in San Fran- 
cisco; and she still wore shining gray gowns 
that matched the bright silver of her hair to a 
shade. Her descendants had inherited little of 
her beauty (Alexina Groome as yet roaming 
space, and, no doubt, having her subtle way 
with ghosts old and new). 

Mrs. McLane had discharged commissions 
for every woman present except Maria, and 
their gowns had been unpacked on the moment, 
that they might be displayed at this notable 
function. They wore the new long basque and 
overskirt made of cloth or cashmere, combined 
with satin, velvet or brocade, and with the exception of Mrs. Abbott they had removed their 
hats. Chignons had disappeared. Hair was 
elaborately dressed at the back or arranged in 
high puffs with two long curls suspended. 
Marguerite Abbott and Annette wore the new 
plaids. Mrs. Abbott had graduated from black 
satin and bugles to cloth, but her bonnet was 
of jet. 



" Now!" exdaimed Mrs. McLane, who had 
been plied with eager questions from oysters 
to dessert. " I've told you all the news about 
the fashions, the salon, the plays, the opera, all 
the scandals of Parig I can remember but you'll 
never guess my pece de resistance?'

" What — what — '' Tea was forgotten. 

" Well — as you know, I was in Berlin during the Congress — " 

" Did you see Bismark — Disraeli — '' 

" I did and met them. But they are not of 
half as much interest to you as some one else — 
two people — I met.'' 

" But who?" 

" Can't you guess?" 

"I know!" cried Guadalupe Bascom. 
" Langdon and Madeleine Masters." 

" No! What would they be doing in Berlin?" demanded Mrs. Ballinger. " I thought 
he was editing some paper in New York." 

" 'Lupie has guessed cprrectly. It's evident 
that you don't keep up. We're just the same 
old stick-in-the-muds. 'Lupie, how did you 
guess? I'll wager you never see a New York 
newspaper yourself." 

" Not I. But one does hear a little Eastern 



 

news now and again. I happen to know that 
Masters has made a success of his paper and it 
would be just like him to go to the Congress 
of Berlin. What was he doing there?'' 

"Oh, nothing in particular. Merely cor- 
responding with his paper, and, in the eyes of 
many, eclipsing Blowitz.'' 

" Who is Blowitz?'' 

"Mon dieu! Mon dieu! But after all 
London is farther off than New York, and I 
don't fancy you read the Times when you are 
there — which is briefly and seldom. Paris is 
our Mecca. Well, Blowitz — " 

"But Madeleine? Madeleine? It is about 
her we want to hear. What do we care about 
tiresome political letters in solemn old news- 
papers? How did she look? How dressed? 
Was she ahead of the mode as ever? Does she 
look much older? Does she show what she 
has been through . , . Oh, Antoinette — 
Mrs. McLane — Mamma — how tiresome you 
are!" 

Mrs. Abbott had not joined in this chorus. 
She had emitted a series of grunts — no less 
primitive word expressing her vocal emissions 
when disgusted. She now had four chins, her 



 

eyes were alarmingly protuberant, and her face, 
what with the tight lacing in vogue, much good 
food and wine, and a pious disapproval of 
powder or any care of a complexion which 
should remain as God made it, was of a deep 
mahogany tintj but her hiand still held the iron 
rod, and if its veins had risen its muscles had 
never grown flaccid. 

"Abominable!" she ejaculated when she 
could make herself heard. " To think that a 
man and a woman like that should be rewarded 
by fame and prosperity. They were thoroughly 
bad and should have been pxmished accord- 
ingly." 

" Oh, no, they were not bad, ma chere," said 
Mrs. McLane lightly. " They were much too 
good. That was the whole trouble. And you 
must admit that for their temporary fall from 
grace they were sufficiently pimished, poor 
things." 

"Antoinette, I am surprised." Mrs. Ballinger spoke as severely as Mrs. Abbott. She 
looked less the Southerner for the moment than 
the Puritan. " They disgraced both themselves 
and Society. I was glad to hear of their reform, but they should have continued to live 



 

in sadcdoth for the rest of their lives. For 
such to enjoy happiness and success is to shake 
the whole social structure, and it is a blow to 
the fundamental laws of religion and morality." 

" But perhaps they are not happy, mamma,'' 
Maria spdce hopefully, although the fates 
seemed to have nothing in pickle for her erratic 
mate. " Mrs. McLane has not yet told us — " 

"Oh, but they are! Quite the happiest 
couple I have ever seen, and likely to remain 
so. That's a case of true love if ever there 
was one. I mislaid my skepticism all the time 
I was in Berlin — a whole month!" 

"Abominable!'' nunbled Mrs. Abbott. 
"And when I think of poor Howard — dead of 
apoplexy — " 

"Howard ate too much, was too fond of 
Burgundy, and grew fatter every year. Made- 
leine could reclaim Masters, but she never had 
any influence over Howard." 

" Well, she could have waited — " 

" Masters was pulled up in the nick of time. 
A year more of that horrible life he was leading 
and he would have been either unreclaimable 
or dead. It makes me believe in Fate — and 
I am a good Churchwoman." 



 

" It's a sad world," commented Mrs. Ballinger with a sigh. " I confess I don't understand it. When I think of Sally — '' 

Mrs. Montgomery, a good kind woman, 
whose purse was always open to her less fortu- 
nate friends, shook her head. " I do not like 
such a sequel. I agree with Alexina and 
Charlotte. They disgraced themselves and our 
proud little Society; they should have been 
more severely punished. Possibly they will be." 

" I doubt it," said Mrs. Bascom drily. " And 
not only because I am a woman of the world and 
have looked at life with both eyes open, but 
because Masters had success in him. I'll wager 
he's had his troubles all in one great landslide. 
And Madeleine was bom to be some man's 
poem. The luxe binding got badly torn and 
stained, but no doubt she's got a finer one than 
ever, and is unchanged — or even improved — 
inside." 

" Oh, do let me get in a word edgeways," 
cried young Mrs. Abbott. " Tell me. Mamma 
— what does Madeleine look like? Has she 
lost her beauty? " 

" She looked to me more beautiful than ever. 
I'd vow Masters thinks so." 



 

" Has she wrinkles? Lines?'' 

" Not one. Have we grown old since she 
left us? It's not so many years ago?" 

"0h, I know. But after all she went 
through. . . . How was she dressed? " 

" What are her favorite colors?" 

" Who makes her gowns?" 

"Has she as much elegance and style as 
ever?" 

" Did she get hei* mother's jewels? Did she 
wear them in Berlin?" 

" Is she in Society there? Is her grand air 
as noticeable among all those court people as 
it was here?" 

" Oh, mamma, mamma, you are so tiresome!" 

Mrs. McLane had had time to drink a second 
cup of tea. 

"My head spins. Where shall I begin? 
The gowns she wore in Berlin were made at 
Worth's. Where else? She still wears 
golden-brown, and amber, and green — sometimes azure — blue at night She looked like 
a fairy queen in blue gauze and diamond stars 
in her hsur one night at the American Legation — " 



 

" How does she wear her hair?" 

" There she is not so much a la mode. She 
has studied her own style, and has found several 
ways of dressing it that become her — sometimes in a low coil, almost on her neck, sometimes on top of her head in a braid like a coronet, sometimes in a soft psyche knot. There 
never was anything monotonous about Made- 
leine.'' 

"I'm going to try every one tomorrow. 
Has she any children?" 

" One. She left him at their place in Virginia. I saw his picture. A beauty, of course." 

Mrs. Ballinger raised her pencilled eyebrows 
and glanced at Maria. Mrs. Abbott gave a 
deep rumbling groan. 

"Poor Howard!" 

"He dreed his weird," said Mrs. McLane 
indifferently. " He couldn't help it. Neither 
could Madeleine." 

"Well, I'd like to hear something more 
about Langdon Masters," announced Guadalupe Bascom. " That is, if you have all satisfied 
your curiosity about Madeleine's clothes. He 
is the one man I never could twist around my 
finger and I've never forgotten him. How 



 

does he look? He certainly should carry some 
stamp of the life he led." 

" Oh, he looks older, of course, and he has 
deeper lines and some gray hairs. But he's 
thin, at least. His figure did not suffer if his 
face did — somewhat. He looks even more 
interesting — at least women would think so. 
You know we good women always have a fatal 
weakness for the man who has lived too much." 

"Speak for yourself, Antoinette." Mrs. 
Ballinger looked like an effigy of virtue in 
silver. "And at your age you should be 
ashamed to utter such a sentiment even if you 
felt it." 

" My hair may be as white as yours," rejoined Mrs. McLane tartly. "But I remain 
a woman, and for that reason attract men to 
this day." 

"Is Masters as brilliant as ever — in conversation, I mean? Is he gay? Lively?" 

" I cannot say that I found him gay, and I 
really saw very little of him except at functions. 
He was very busy. But Mr. McLane was with 
him a good deal, and said that although he was 
rather grim and quiet at times, at others he was 
as brilliant as his letters."
