“By the way, uncle—I’m sorry to trouble you, but—could you lend me
three hundred dollars for a few weeks?”

“Three hundred dollars!” exclaimed the venerable seeker after the main
chance, just as though I had attacked him in the tenderest part of his
being.

“The fact is, uncle, getting married in these times is an expensive
luxury, and I find myself a little short, though, of course, I shall be
all right as soon as I get settled down.”

“It’s rather a bad sign for a young man to have to borrow money to get
married with,” he added with a glance of severe dignity at me.

“Never mind it, uncle. I won’t trouble you, then, if it is not
convenient,” I replied, in a thoroughly off-hand manner, as though the
little favor I asked was of more consequence to him than to me. “I
shall expect to see you at the house of Mr. Oliphant at the ceremony,
and remember the levee is at eight o’clock. Don’t fail to be there,
uncle.”

“Stop a minute! I suppose if you need three hundred dollars, I can let
you have it,” he added.

“O, it is of no consequence. Don’t trouble yourself. Two or three of my
friends wanted to lend it to me, but I did not exactly like to accept
such a favor outside of the family. Aunt Rachel, I dare say, will be
glad to accommodate me.”

“Write a note,” said he, rather crustily, as he went to one of the
desks, and drew a check for the amount I required.

I could not help smiling, as I wrote the due bill, to think of the
address with which I had managed my case. I am confident if I had
whined and begged until the sun went down, he would have been hard
enough to refuse me. Possibly he did not like to have me apply to Aunt
Rachel. She was a maiden sister of my father who had about twenty
thousand dollars and lived with my mother. Her inheritance had been
the same as my father’s, but, having no expenses, she had kept certain
lands in the middle of the town till they increased in value so that
she was made independent. As I wished to be her heir, I had always
treated her with the utmost consideration. Captain Halliard managed
some stocks for her, and he was anxious to keep in her good graces.

I put the check in my pocket with the utmost nonchalance, and again
begging my uncle not to fail to be present at the ceremony, I left him.
It was all right with me for the present. When I started on my bridal
tour I owed about six hundred dollars, which I calculated that I could
easily pay off in six months with my increased salary. When we returned
from Washington I had barely money enough left to pay the hackman for
conveying us to the house of my wife’s father. If I had not been so
cautious as to count up my money, and estimate the expenses of the
return trip, I should have exhausted my exchequer before we reached
home. When I found I had just enough left to pay these expenses, I
told Lilian that I had received a letter which compelled me to return
immediately, though we had intended to stay two days longer.

She pouted, but I told her I should lose my situation if I did not
go back. She thought I might get another situation rather than break
up the pleasant excursion so abruptly. I told her I could easily
get another situation, but it was not exactly prudent to give up one
until the other was obtained. It almost broke my heart to cross her
in anything, and if I could have met a friend good-natured enough to
lend me a hundred dollars I might have been spared the annoyance. I met
no such friend, and we went on cheating each other as before. It was
stupid in me to do so, but I had not the courage to tell her that I was
not made of money, and I permitted her to believe that my pockets were
still well lined.

We returned home, but on the way I was obliged to pretend that I was
sick, in order to save the expense of supper aboard the steamer. We had
dined at four o’clock, and though it was absurd to eat again at six,
Lilian wanted to see who were at the tables; but my pretended illness
saved me, and, what was more important, saved the two dollars for the
hack hire in Boston.

“What shall we do when we get home?” asked Lilian, as we sat that
evening in the cabin of the steamer.

“We shall live on love for years to come,” I replied, with enthusiasm.

“Of course we shall do that,” she added; but I thought she did not
seem to be exactly pleased with the diet. “Shall we board or keep
house?”

“Which do you prefer, my dear Lilian?” I asked, for though we had
discussed this question before, she had not been able to make up her
mind.

“If we can board at the Revere House, or at Mrs. Peecksmith’s in Beacon
street, I would rather board.”

“It would not be possible to obtain such rooms as would suit us at
the Revere House at this season of the year; and I heard a gentleman
in Washington say that Mrs. Peecksmith had not a single apartment
unoccupied.”

“How provoking!”

It was provoking, but I had to invent my excuses as I went along. I
did not venture to suggest that my entire salary would not pay the
expenses of boarding at either of the places she named. I was too weak
and vain to tell her the truth. I deceived her. She had no knowledge
of the world, no experience of the value of money, for her poor father
had actually ruined himself in a vain attempt to keep up the style of
living he had enjoyed in more prosperous days. Nearly all his profits
went upon the backs of his daughters, each of whom had been taught to
believe that a husband, when interpreted, was money. I did nothing to
disturb the illusion.

“I think we must find a place to board for a few weeks, till we can get
a house, and then we will go to housekeeping,” I suggested.

“We must go to housekeeping if we can’t get rooms at the Revere, or at
Mrs. Peecksmith’s,” added Lilian. “But dear ma will take us to board
for a time; and really I could not think of going anywhere else.”

We went to “dear ma’s,” and after I had paid the hackman, I had just
twenty-five cents left in my pocket. “Dear ma” was willing to take
us to board for a time, under the circumstances, though it would be
a great inconvenience to her. She would not think of taking anybody
else, though she had plenty of house room. I ventured to hint that, as
a prudent man, I should like to know what the terms would be, though
really it did not make the least difference to me, in point of fact.
“Dear ma” did not like to speak of such things; she was going to take
us simply as a matter of accommodation—“under the circumstances.”

“Of course, Mrs. Oliphant, I understand you, and I am very grateful
for the sacrifice you propose to make; but it is always well to have
things clearly set forth,” I replied, mildly.

“Certainly it is. I always believe in having things in black and
white. I suppose it would cost you fifty dollars a week to board at
Mrs. Peecksmith’s; but I should not think of charging you that,” she
continued, with a benevolent smile.

“Gracious! I should hope not,” I mentally ejaculated, for at the Beacon
Street house the boarders walked on Wilton carpets, looked out through
windows decked with velvet draperies, slept upon rosewood bedsteads,
and had seven courses at dinner, while Mr. Oliphant’s house was an old
one, its furniture worn out and dilapidated, its carpets threadbare,
and the fare—when they had no extra company—below the grade of a
cheap boarding-house. If I had not loved Lilian with all my soul, I
should have deemed it a charity to take her off her parents’ hands. As
it was, she was cheap at any price.

“Whatever you say will be all right,” I replied. “I am getting a
handsome salary now, and I am willing to pay a fair price.”

“I think thirty dollars a week would be no more than the cost to us. Of
course I don’t expect you to pay anything near what it would cost at
Mrs. Peecksmith’s.”

Whew! I could board at a house only one grade below Beacon Street for
twenty. I expected she would say ten, or at the most fifteen dollars,
but, poor “dear ma!” I suppose she needed the money to deck out the
next daughter for the sacrifice. I could not object. It was all in the
family; but I determined to find a house with all possible dispatch.

I went to the bank and took my place. I flatter myself that I was
smart, for I won the approbation of even Mr. Bristlebach. I made no
mistakes. I was not nervous. When I drew my month’s salary of one
hundred and fifty dollars, all but about twenty dollars of it went
into the purse of “dear ma,” for board which would have been high at
ten dollars a week. Though Lilian complained of the accommodations,
she said nothing about housekeeping. I made some inquiries, and
found I could board better for half the price I was paying. I then
said something about engaging rooms nearer to the bank. My dear wife
protested. She could not leave “dear ma’s,” where she had all the
comforts of a home, and was in her own family. I saw that she was a
party to the swindle; that “dear ma” had instructed her what to do and
what to say.

My home was no home at all, and I was determined to leave it before I
had another month’s board to pay. To stay any longer would be ruin. My
twenty dollars’ surplus would pay for only a few concerts and rides,
and in less than a fortnight I was penniless again. My debts began to
trouble me. One day Captain Halliard wanted to know if he had not lent
me three hundred dollars for a few weeks. I assured him he had, and
that I intended to pay him in a few days. Tom Flynn hinted that he was
short, though he did not directly say he wanted his money. My tailor
was becoming slightly unreasonable, and the keeper of a livery stable
stupidly insisted upon being paid, and even had the audacity to refuse
to trust me for any more teams.

It would not do for me to have these importunate creditors coming into
the bank to see me. The president and the cashier would be alarmed if
they discovered that the paying teller was in debt. But trying as these
duns were, they were insignificant compared with the annoyances which I
endured at “dear ma’s.” Lilian hinted, and then insisted, that I should
refurnish our room at my own expense. I told her I would think of it,
and went out to walk after dinner. I did think of it; and thought
I would not do it. Strange as it may seem, “dear ma” was absolutely
becoming disagreeable to me, and I wondered how such an angel as Lilian
could have been born of such a designing woman as I found her mother to
be.

I stumbled upon a friend who had been to look at a house. It was a
splendid little place, but not quite large enough for him, and the rent
was only six hundred dollars a year. I went with him to see it. It
looked like a fairy palace to me, and was just the size I wanted. It
was an English basement house, three stories high. I went to see the
owner. Another man had just left it, and meant to take the house, but
he must first consult his wife. If I stopped to consult mine, I should
lose it, and I closed with him on the instant, regarding myself as the
luckiest fellow in the world.

Lilian would be delighted with it; there could be no doubt of that.
What a magnificent surprise it would be to her, if I could take her
in, after it was all furnished! Stupid as the idea may seem to lady
housekeepers, I was so enamored of my plan that I determined to put it
into operation. I was satisfied we could live in this gem of a house
for less than I paid for board, and live in much better style.

The idea of a surprise to Lilian was delightful to me, and I laid out
the plan in detail; but the first thing was to provide the funds.
Then my jaw dropped down. I owed over six hundred dollars to certain
restless creditors; but I could save money by going to housekeeping,
and my duty to them required that I should do so. I had not yet
troubled Aunt Rachel, and taking Lilian with me, I went down to
Springhaven to spend the Fourth of July, ostensibly to escape the noise
and dust of the city, but really to lay siege to my venerable aunt’s
purse strings.

The only thing that was likely to defeat me was the fact that Aunt
Rachel did not like my wife, for Lilian, who regarded the worthy
spinster as an “old fuss,” had not always been as prudent in her
presence as I could have wished. But I caught my aunt alone at five
o’clock in the morning, for the noise of fire-crackers had driven the
old creature from her bed at an unwonted hour. I played my cards with
all the skill of which I was master. She not only gave me the money,
a thousand dollars, which she had “salted down” in the house for fear
all the banks would break, but she promised to keep my secret. She
declared that Lilian was too extravagant for a young man like me, and
I explained that I wished to furnish the house without her knowledge,
so as to save expense. She commended my good motive, and I returned to
the city with a thousand dollars in my pocket, to furnish the English
basement house.




CHAPTER IV.

THE ENGLISH BASEMENT HOUSE.


A THOUSAND dollars in cash was more than I had ever before possessed
at one time. I felt like a rich man, for the shadow of the six hundred
dollars which I owed did not offensively obtrude itself upon me. I
could hardly conceal my exhilaration from Lilian, but I was so intent
upon giving her a grand surprise that I kept the great secret, and
preserved a forced calmness. I had made very careful estimates of the
cost of living in my new palace—I thought they were very careful—and
I was fully satisfied that I should save one-third of my present
expenses.

My column of figures, after I had thought of every possible expense
that could be incurred in the course of the week, footed up at a trifle
over twenty dollars a week, but I was entirely convinced that I should
bring the actual below the estimated expense. From the first of July my
salary was to be two thousand a year, or about thirty-eight dollars and
a half a week. I could therefore let my expenses go up to twenty-five
dollars a week without upsetting the argument.

Then I allowed three hundred a year for clothing my wife and myself,
and for incidental expenses. In our beautiful home we should not care
to ride and go to concerts and theatres much, and both of us were
well supplied with clothing. I deemed the sum appropriated as amply
sufficient. At this rate I could pay off my debts in a year and a half,
and be square with the world. Until this was done, I intended to hold
myself to a most rigid economy. I must even contrive some way to let
Lilian know that I could not spend money so freely as I had done, but I
could promise her that, when my debts were paid, she should have every
thing she wanted.

I was perfectly satisfied. My prudential calculations set me all right
with myself and with the rest of mankind. The vision of the English
basement house, all finished and furnished, with Lilian sitting in
state in the little boudoir of a parlor, was my castle in the air for
the present. I was very cheerful and light hearted, and went to my
daily duties at the bank with an alacrity I had never before felt.
I told Lilian I should not be at home to dinner that day. When she
wanted to know why, I said something about bank commissioners, and was
afraid I should be detained until a late hour. She kissed me as usual
when I left her, and even “dear ma” looked so very amiable, that I was
afraid she would kiss me too. But she did not, and my heart smote me
as I thought of the treason I was meditating against her and the two
unmarried daughters.

I ought to say here, in justice to myself, that these two sisters
of my wife were a heavy burden upon me, independently of the thirty
dollars a week I paid for my board; for if Lilian and I proposed to go
to a concert, to the theatre or the opera, it was somehow contrived
that one or both of them should join the party. My wife reasoned that
a carriage would cost no more for four than for two, and the paltry
expense of the tickets was all the additional outlay I incurred, while
it was such a pleasure for the sisters to go. Then I could just as
well purchase three pairs of white kids as one—Mrs. Oliphant would pay
me for them. I must do her the justice to say that she always offered
to do so, but, as it was “all in the family,” I was too magnificent to
stoop to such trifles; and I know that she would have considered me
mean if I had accepted the paltry dollars. I went to the bank with the
thousand dollars in my pocket. I intended to devote the afternoon to
selecting the furniture for my new house. My friend Buckleton was in
the furniture business. He would not only keep my secret, but he would
give me a bargain on his wares; and what was better, if I came a little
short he would trust me. The thousand dollars’ worth of goods in my
house was so much real property, the possession of which would add to
my credit, and was available as security, if occasion required.



The bank closed, and after I had settled my cash, I decided to take
a little lunch at Parker’s before I went to Buckleton’s store. I was
going out of the bank when that confounded Shaytop, the stable man,
presented himself before me like the ghost of a faded joy. He had the
impudence to thrust his little bill, which amounted to only sixty odd
dollars, in my sunny face. Humph! sixty dollars was nothing to me in
my present frame of mind. I didn’t “cotton” to any such sum as that,
and Mr. Bristlebach, the president of the bank, who was reputed to be
worth a million, could not have looked more magnificent than I did, if
he had tried.

“Mr. Glasswood, I am getting rather tired of calling on you about my
bill,” Shaytop began, in the most uncompromising manner.

“Do I owe you anything, Mr. Shaytop?” I inquired, very loftily.

“Do you owe me anything!” exclaimed the fellow, opening his eyes wide
enough to catch a vision of the prophetic future. “I reckon you do.”

“Is it possible? I declare, I had quite forgotten the circumstance.”

“Forgotten it! I’ll bet you didn’t! I think I have taken pains enough
to keep you informed of it.”

“Don’t be rude, Mr. Shaytop. I don’t permit any man to dun me.”

“Don’t you? Well, by George, you have made an exception in my favor.
Haven’t I been to see you once a week for the last three months?”

“I don’t remember,” I replied, vacantly.

“Look here, my gay bird, you can’t tom-fool me any longer. I’m going to
have my money, or break something,” he added, with an energetic gesture.

“Certainly, my dear sir, if I owe you anything, I shall pay it with
greater pleasure than you will receive it.”

“I’ll bet you won’t! I want to see Mr. Bristlebach. I don’t think he
likes to have his clerks run up bills for teams, and not pay for them.”

“All right; you can see Mr. Bristlebach, if you wish. He is in the
director’s room. Shall I introduce you to him?”

“I want to see him if you are not going to pay me.”

“Haven’t I told you that I should take great pleasure in paying you,
if I owe you anything. It had slipped my mind that I owed you’ a bill,
though now it comes to me that there is a small balance due you.”

“A small balance! You owe me sixty-two dollars!”

“Well, I call that a small balance. In the bank we deal in big figures.
How long have I owed you sixty-two dollars, Mr. Shaytop?”

“About six months.”

“Exactly so! Have you added interest?”

“No. I shall be glad enough to get the bill, without saying anything
about the interest.”

“If I forgot this little matter, it is not right that you should lose
anything by my neglect. Add the interest to your bill, and I will pay
it.”

“That’s what you said every time I asked you for the money—all but the
interest.”

“I’m going up to Parker’s for a lunch now. If you will call there in
half an hour, I will pay you the bill and the interest,” I continued,
glancing at the clock in the bank.

“If you mean so, I’ll be there.”

“Don’t insult me, Mr. Shaytop.”

“I’ll be there, and if you are not there, I’ll take the next best step.”

He turned on his heel, and left me. It was painfully impressed upon
my mind that I must pay that bill, and thus diminish the resources
for furnishing the house. But I was something of a philosopher, and
I argued that paying this demand would not increase the sum total
of my indebtedness; it would only transfer it to the account of the
furniture. This thought suggested a new train of ideas. My tailor was
bothering me about a little bill I owed him; Uncle Halliard would be
asking me again if I did not owe him three hundred dollars; and Tom
Flynn would hint that he was short. Why could I not improve my credit
by paying off all these debts, and “running my face” for the furniture?
It was worthy of consideration as a piece of financial policy.

I went to Parker’s, and ordered “a little lunch” which cost me a dollar
and a half. Before I had finished it, Shaytop made his appearance.
I never saw a fellow look more doubtful than he did. He evidently
believed that he had come on a fool’s errand. Since I could not well
avoid paying the bill, I was to have the pleasure of dissolving this
illusion in his mind.

“Sit down, Mr. Shaytop,” I began politely, pointing to the chair
opposite my own at the table.

“I haven’t much time to spare,” he replied, glancing at the viands
before me, perhaps with the ill-natured reflection that this was the
way the money went which ought to be used in paying his bill.

“Won’t you have something to eat, Mr. Shaytop; or something to drink,
if you please?”

“No, I thank you; I’ve been to dinner, and I never drink anything.”

“Happy to have you eat or drink with me,” I added, coolly.

“I’m in a hurry, Mr. Glasswood.”

“Are you? Well, I’m sorry for that. We don’t live out more than half of
our lives on account of always being in a hurry. By the way it seems
to me very strange I forgot that little bill of yours. One hundred and
sixty-two dollars, I think you said it was?”

“Sixty-two dollars, I said,” he answered as if congratulating himself
that it was not the sum I named.

He took the bill from his pocket, and laid it on the table before me.

“Good!” said I, glancing at the document. “I’m a hundred dollars in. I
was thinking you said it was a hundred and sixty-two.”

I intimated to the waiter that he might bring me a Charlotte Russe, and
he removed the dishes from the table.

“I don’t like to hurry you, Mr. Glasswood, but I ought to be at the
stable.”

“O, you are in a hurry! I had quite forgotten that you said so. Well, I
will not keep you waiting,” I replied drawing my porte-monnaie from
my pocket.

His eyes glistened, and I think he had a hope by this time. I glanced
at the bill again.

“You haven’t added the interest,” I continued.

“Never mind the interest.”

“But I am very willing to pay it.”

“Well, you add it. You can figure as fast again as I can.

“Sixty-three, eighty-six,” I replied. “Receipt the bill, Mr. Shaytop.”

He went over to the cashier’s desk and performed this pleasing
operation. I think the act gave him an additional hope of receiving his
money.

“Perhaps you had just as lief take my due bill for six months for this
amount, now that we have added the interest?” I suggested.

“No, I’ll be hanged if I had!” retorted he, very sharply. “Have you
brought me up here, and wasted an hour of my time, to give me your
note, which isn’t worth the paper you will write it on?”

“You are impudent, Mr. Shaytop.”

“Perhaps I am, but—”

“Never mind; if you don’t want the note, you can have the money. It
don’t make much difference to me, though it would be more convenient to
pay the bill at another time than now. There isn’t the least need of
making use of any strong language.”

“Pay me, and I won’t use any, then.”

I opened my porte-monnaie and took therefrom the roll of bills I had
received from Aunt Rachel. A five hundred dollar bill was on the top,
and the balance of the pile was in hundreds and fifties. I ran through
the bills with professional dexterity, so that he could see the quality
of them.

“I can’t make the change, Mr. Shaytop,” I replied, with cool
indifference.

I glanced at him. I went up in that man’s estimation from zero to
summer heat. He would have trusted me for a span every day in the week
for six months. I took out a hundred dollar bill and tossed it over to
him. As I suspected, he could not give me the change. He went to the
counter and procured smaller bills for it, and gave me the sum coming
to me. He had ceased to be in a hurry.

“If you want any more teams, Mr. Glasswood, I think I can fit you out
as well as any other stable in the city,” said he, after he had put his
wallet back into his pocket.

“I don’t,” I replied, curtly.

“Don’t you ride any now?”

“Yes, just as much as ever; but you see, Mr. Shaytop, I don’t like
to be bothered with these small accounts, and to deal with men who
think so much of little things,” I answered, magnificently. “You have
threatened to speak to Mr. Bristlebach, which you are quite welcome to
do; and you intimate that my note is not worth the paper on which it is
written.

“I hope you will excuse me for what I said, but I was a little vexed”
pleaded he. “I was mistaken in you. The fact of it is, I lost two or
three bills—”

“You haven’t lost anything by me, and I don’t intend you shall,” I
interposed.

I finished my “little lunch,” rose from the table, and having paid
my bill, left the house. Shaytop followed me. He wanted my trade,
now that he had seen the inside of my pocket-book. But I shook him
off as soon as I desired to do so, and hastened to the store of
Buckleton. Confidentially I stated my plan to him, and he was willing
to be my bosom friend. In the course of the interview I opened my
porte-monnaie, and contrived that he should see the figures on the
bank bills it contained. It was surprising how those figures opened his
heart.

When I suggested that I was making a large outlay, he volunteered to
trust me to any extent I desired. He was kind enough to go with me to
the carpet store, and assist me in the selection of the goods I wanted.
I insisted upon paying two hundred dollars on account, which made the
carpet people astonishingly good-natured to me; and I was taken aback
when they offered to give me credit. Buckleton then went with me to
the kitchen furnishing store, and his advice helped me very much as I
wandered through the long lists of articles. I made the selection and
paid the bill.

When we returned to the furniture store, I warmed toward him, and
finally prevailed on him to accept two hundred dollars towards the bill
I bought of him. He gave me a receipt. When we footed up the prices of
the goods I had selected, I was rather startled to find they amounted
to nearly eight hundred dollars.

“I can’t afford that!” I protested, “I must go over it again, and take
some cheaper articles.”

“It don’t pay to buy cheap furniture, Glasswood,” replied my friend.
“You have been very moderate in your selections.”

He overcame my scruples by declaring that I need not pay for the goods
till it suited my own convenience. I left him and went back to the bank
to count my funds. I had only four hundred and seventy dollars left.
I could not pay off the six hundred of old debts now; so I left the
matter open for further consideration.

The carpet people went to work immediately, and in a week all the rooms
were ready for the furniture. Buckleton was so obliging as to go to
the house himself and arrange the chairs, tables, bedsteads and other
articles. The kitchen furniture was all put in the closets, hung up on
the walls, or otherwise disposed of, so that the place looked like an
occupied home. I had sheets, pillow-cases, towels, and other articles
made up, and in three weeks the English basement-house looked as cosey
as the heart of a bank officer could desire.

But fearful inroads had been made upon my exchequer. The carpet people
made up a total bill of three hundred and thirty dollars; and when I
hinted that I might possibly find it necessary to avail myself of their
offer to give me credit, they had a note to pay and wanted the cash. I
was too magnificent to haggle. I settled their bill—and cursed them
in my heart. When I had paid everything except the six hundred I owed
Buckleton, I had only ninety dollars in my pocket.

I was alarmed. A cold sweat stood on my forehead as I added up
the items and found that I was twelve hundred dollars in debt. The
situation worried me for a few days, but I soon became accustomed
to it. I consoled myself with the hope that the bank would raise my
salary, though I could pay off the debts with my present income in
three years. It would all come out right in the end, and it was useless
to worry about the matter.

I didn’t worry long. The English basement house, all furnished, new
and elegant, with a Biddy in the kitchen, was a joy which could not be
ignored. If it had cost me nearly fifteen hundred dollars to furnish
the house, I had that amount of property on hand, and my debts were
really no more than before. The house was ready for my wife, and I
proposed to her, one afternoon, when all was ready, to take a walk with
me.




CHAPTER V.
