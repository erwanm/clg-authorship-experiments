into taking it by the owners, whom she had met somewhere 
and who had made up to her immensely, persuading her 
that she might really have it for nothing for no more 
than she would give for the little honeysuckle cottage, the 
old parsonage embowered in clematis, which were really 
what she had been looking for. Besides it was one of those 
old musty mansions, ever so far from town, which it was 
always difficult to let, or to get a price for ; and then it was 
a wretched house for living in. Hyacinth, for whom his 
three hours in the train had been a series of happy throbs, 
had not been struck with its geographical remoteness, and 
he asked the Princess what she meant, in such a connec- 
tion, by using the word ' wretched.' To this she replied 
that the place was tumbling to pieces, inconvenient in every 
respect, full of ghosts and bad smells. ' That is the only 
reason I come to have it. I don't want you to think me 
more luxurious than I am, or that I throw away money. 
Never, never ! ' Hyacinth had no standard by which he 
could measure the importance his opinion would have for 
her, and he perceived that though she judged him as a 
creature still open to every initiation, whose naivete would 
entertain her, it was also her fancy to treat him as an old 
friend, a person to whom she might have had the habit of 
referring her difficulties. Her performance of the part she 
had undertaken to play was certainly complete, and every- 
thing lay before him but the reason she had for playing it. 
One of the gardens at Medley took the young man's 
heart beyond the others; it had high brick walls, on the 
sunny sides of which was a great training of apricots and 
plums, and straight walks, bordered with old-fashioned 
homely flowers, inclosing immense squares where other 



xxn   in 

fruit-trees stood upright and mint and lavender floated in 
the air. In the southern quarter it overhung a small, dis- 
used canal, and here a high embankment had been raised, 
which was also long and broad and covered with fine turf; 
so that the top of it, looking down at the canal, made a 
magnificent grassy terrace, than which, on a summer's day, 
there could be no more delightful place for strolling up and 
down with a companion all the more that, at either end, 
was a curious pavilion, in the manner of a tea-house, which 
completed the scene in an old-world sense and offered rest 
and privacy, a refuge from sun or shower. One of these 
pavilions was an asylum for gardeners' tools and superfluous 
flower-pots ; the other was covered, inside, with a queer 
Chinese paper, representing ever so many times over a 
group of people with faces like blind kittens, having tea 
while they sat on the floor. It also contained a big, clumsy 
inlaid cabinet, in which cups and saucers showed them- 
selves through doors of greenish glass, together with a 
carved cocoanut and a pair of outlandish idols. On a 
shelf, over a sofa, not very comfortable though it had 
cushions of faded tapestry, which looked like samplers, 
was a row of novels, out of date and out of print novels 
that one couldn't have found any more and that were only 
there. On the chimney-piece was a bowl of dried rose- 
leaves, mixed with some aromatic spice, and the whole place 
suggested a certain dampness. 

On the terrace Hyacinth paced to and fro with the 
Princess until she suddenly remembered that he had not 
had his luncheon. He protested that this was the last 
thing he wished to think of, but she declared that she had 
not asked him down to Medley to starve him and that he 





must go back and be fed. They went back, but by a very 
roundabout way, through the park, so that they really had 
half an hour's more talk. She explained to him that she 
herself breakfasted at twelve o'clock, in the foreign fashion, 
and had tea in the afternoon ; as he too was so foreign he 
might like that better, and in this case, on the morrow, 
they would breakfast together. He could have coffee, and 
anything else he wanted, brought to his room when he woke 
up. When Hyacinth had sufficiently composed himself, in 
the presence of this latter image he thought he saw a 
footman arranging a silver service at his bedside he men- 
tioned that really, as regarded the morrow, he should have 
to be back in London. There was a train at nine o'clock ; 
he hoped she didn't mind his taking it. She looked at him 
a moment, gravely and kindly, as if she were considering 
an abstract idea, and then she said, 'Oh yes, I mind it 
very much. Not to-morrow some other day.' He made 
no rejoinder, and the Princess spoke of something else ; 
that is, his rejoinder was private, and consisted of the 
reflection that he would leave Medley in the morning, 
whatever she might say. He simply couldn't afford to stay ; 
he couldn't be out of work. And then Madame Grandoni 
thought it so important ; for though the old lady was obscure 
she was decidedly impressive. The Princess's protest, how- 
ever, was to be reckoned with ; he felt that it might take 
a form less cursory than the words she had just uttered, 
which would make it embarrassing. She was less solemn, 
less explicit, than Madame Grandoni had been, but there 
was something in her slight seriousness and the delicate 
way in which she signified a sort of command that seemed 
to tell him his liberty was going the liberty he had 



 

managed to keep (till the other day, when he gave Hoffen- 
dahl a mortgage on it), and the possession of which had in 
some degree consoled him for other forms of penury. This 
made him uneasy ; what would become of him if he should 
add another servitude to the one he had undertaken, at the 
end of that long, anxious cab-drive in the rain, in that dim 
back-bedroom of a house as to whose whereabouts he was 
even now not clear, while Muniment and Poupin and 
Schinkel, all visibly pale, listened and accepted the vow ? 
Muniment and Poupin and Schinkel how disconnected, 
all the same, he felt from them at the present hour \ how 
little he was the young man who had made the pilgrimage in 
the cab ; and how the two latter, at least, if they could have 
a glimpse of him now, would wonder what he was up to ! 

As to this, Hyacinth wondered sufficiently himself, while 
the Princess touched upon the people and places she had 
seen, the impressions and conclusions she had gathered, 
since their former meeting. It was to such matters as these 
that she directed the conversation ; she appeared to wish 
to keep it off his own concerns, and he was surprised at her 
continued avoidance of the slums and the question of her 
intended sacrifices. She mentioned none of her friends by 
name, but she talked of their character, their houses, their 
manners, taking for granted, as before, that Hyacinth would 
always follow. So far as he followed he was edified, but 
he had to admit to himself that half the time he didn't 
know what she was talking about. At all events, if he had 
been with the dukes (she didn't call her associates dukes, 
but Hyacinth was sure they were of that order), he would 
have got more satisfaction from them. She appeared, on 
the whole, to judge the English world severely ; to think 



poorly of its wit, and even worse of its morals. 'You 
know people oughtn't to be both corrupt and dull,' she 
said; and Hyacinth turned this over, feeling that he 
certainly had not yet caught the point of view of a person 
for whom the aristocracy was a collection of bores. He 
had sometimes taken great pleasure in hearing that it was 
fabulously profligate, but he was rather disappointed in the 
bad account the Princess gave of it. She remarked that 
she herself was very corrupt she ought to have mentioned 
that before but she had never been accused of being 
stupid. Perhaps he would discover it, but most of the 
people she had had to do with thought her only too lively. 
The second allusion that she made to their ulterior designs 
(Hyacinth's and hers) was when she said, ' I determined to 
see it' she was speaking still of English society 'to 
learn for myself what it really is, before we blow it up. I 
have been here now a year and a half, and, as I tell you, 
I feel that I have seen. It is the old regime again, the 
rottenness and extravagance, bristling with every iniquity 
and every abuse, over which the French Revolution passed 
like a whirlwind ; or perhaps even more a reproduction of 
Roman society in its decadence, gouty, apoplectic, depraved, 
gorged and clogged with wealth and spoils, selfishness and 
scepticism, and waiting for the onset of the barbarians. 
You and I are the barbarians, you know.' The Princess 
was pretty general, after all, in her animadversions, and 
regaled him with no anecdotes (he rather missed them) that 
would have betrayed the hospitality she had enjoyed. She 
couldn't treat him absolutely as if he had been an ambas- 
sador. By way of defending the aristocracy he said to her 
that it couldn't be true they were all a bad lot (he used that 



 

expression because she had let him know that she liked 
him to speak in the manner of the people), inasmuch as 
he had an acquaintance among them a noble lady who 
was one of the purest, kindest, most conscientious human 
beings it was possible to imagine. At this she stopped 
short and looked at him ; then she asked, ' Whom do you 
mean a noble lady ? ' 

' I suppose there is no harm saying. Lady Aurora 
Langrish.' 

' I don't know her. Is she nice ? ' 

' I like her ever so much. 

' Is she pretty, clever ? ' 

' She isn't pretty, but she is very uncommon,' said 
Hyacinth. 

' How did you make her acquaintance ? ' As he hesi- 
tated, she went on, ' Did you bind some books for her ? ' 

' No. I met her in a place called Audley Court.' 

'Where is that?' 

' In Camberwell.' 

' And who lives there ? ' 

' A young woman I was calling on, who is bedridden.' 

'And the lady you speak of what do you call her, 
Lydia Languish ? goes to see her ? ' 

' Yes, very often.' 

The Princess was silent a moment, looking at him. 
' Will you take me there ? ' 

; With great pleasure. The young woman I speak of 
is the sister of the chemist's assistant you will perhaps 
remember that I mentioned to you.' 

' Yes, I remember. It must be one of the first places 
we go to. I am sorry,' the Princess added, walking on. 



Hyacinth inquired what she might be sorry for, but she 
took no notice of his question, and presently remarked, 
' Perhaps she goes to see him.' 

' Goes to see whom ? ' 

'The chemist's assistant the brother.' She said this 
very seriously. 

' Perhaps she does,' Hyacinth rejoined, laughing. ' But 
she is a fine sort of woman.' 

The Princess repeated that she was sorry, and he again 
asked her for what for Lady Aurora's being  of that sort ? 
To which she replied, ' No ; I mean for my not being the 
first what is it you call them ? noble lady that you have 
encountered.' 

' I don't see what difference that makes. You needn't 
be afraid you don't make an impression on me.' 

' I was not thinking of that. I was thinking that you 
might be less fresh than I thought.' 

' Of course I don't know what you thought,' said Hya- 
cinth, smiling. 

' No j how should you ? ' 



XXIII 

HE was in the library, after luncheon, when word was 
brought to him that the carriage was at the door, for 
their drive; and when he went into the hall he found 
Madame Grandoni, bonneted and cloaked, awaiting the 
descent of the Princess. ' You see I go with you. I am 
always there,' she remarked, jovially. ' The Princess has 
me with her to take care of her, and this is how I do it. 
Besides, I never miss my drive.' 

' You are different from me ; this will be the first I have 
ever had in my life.' He could establish that distinction 
without bitterness, because he was too pleased with his 
prospect to believe the old lady's presence could spoil it. 
He had nothing to say to the Princess that she might not 
hear. He didn't dislike her for coming, even after she had 
said to him, in answer to his own announcement, speaking 
rather more sententiously than was her wont, 'It doesn't 
surprise me that you have not spent your life in carriages. 
They have nothing to do with your trade.' 

' Fortunately not,' he answered. ' I should have made 
a ridiculous coachman.' 

The Princess appeared, and they mounted into a great 
square barouche, an old-fashioned, high-hung vehicle, with 
a green body, a faded hammer-cloth and a rumble where 



the footman sat (the Princess mentioned that it had been 
let with the house), which rolled ponderously and smoothly 
along the winding avenue and through the gilded gates 
(they were surmounted with an immense escutcheon) of the 
park. The progress of this oddly composed trio had a 
high respectability, and that is one of the reasons why 
Hyacinth felt the occasion to be tremendously memorable. 
There might still be greater joys in store for him he was 
by this time quite at sea, and could recognise no shores 
but he would never again in his life be so respectable. 
The drive was long and comprehensive, but very little was 
said while it lasted. ' I shall show you the whole country : 
it is exquisitely beautiful; it speaks to the heart.' Of so 
much as this his hostess had informed him at the start ; and 
she added, in French, with a light, allusive nod at the rich, 
humanised landscape, ' Voila ce que faime en Angleterre.' 
For the rest, she sat there opposite to him, in quiet fairness, 
under her softly-swaying, lace-fringed parasol : moving her 
eyes to where she noticed that his eyes rested; allowing 
them, when the carriage passed anything particularly 
charming, to meet his own ; smiling as if she enjoyed the 
whole affair very nearly as much as he ; and now and then 
calling his attention to some prospect, some picturesque 
detail, by three words of which the cadence was sociable. 
Madame Grandoni dozed most of the time, with her chin 
resting on rather a mangy ermine tippet, in which she had 
enveloped herself; expanding into consciousness at moments, 
however, to greet the scenery with comfortable polyglot 
ejaculations. If Hyacinth was exalted, during these 
delightful hours, he at least measured his exaltation, and it 
kept him almost solemnly still, as if with the fear that a 



 

wrong movement of any sort would break the charm, cause 
the curtain to fall upon the play. This was especially the 
case when his senses oscillated back from the objects that 
sprang up by the way, every one of which was a rich image / 
of something he had longed for, to the most beautiful 
woman in England, who sat there, close to him, as com- 
pletely for his benefit as if he had been a painter engaged 
to make her portrait. More than once he saw everything 
through a mist ; his eyes were full of tears. 

That evening they sat in the drawing-room after dinner, 
as the Princess had promised, or, as he was inclined to 
consider it, threatened him. The force of the threat was in 
his prevision that the ladies would make themselves fine, 
and that in contrast with the setting and company he should 
feel dingier than ever ; having already on his back the only 
tolerably decent coat he possessed, and being unable to 
exchange it for a garment of the pattern that civilised 
people (so much he knew, if he couldn't emulate them), 
put on about eight o'clock. The ladies, when they came 
to dinner, looked festal indeed ; but Hyacinth was able to 
make the reflection that he was more pleased to be dressed 
as he was dressed, meanly and unsuitably as it was, than he 
should have been to present such a figure as Madame 
Grandoni, in whose toggery there was something comical. 
He was coming more and more round to the sense that if 
the Princess didn't mind his poorness, in every way, he had 
no call to mind it himself. His present circumstances were 
not of his seeking they had been forced upon him ; they 
were not the fruit of a disposition to push. How little the 
Princess minded how much, indeed, she enjoyed the con- 
sciousness that in having him about her in that manner she 





was playing a trick upon society, the false and conventional 
society she had measured and despised was manifest from 
the way she had introduced him to the people they found 
awaiting them in the hall on the return from their drive : 
four ladies, a mother and three daughters, who had come 
over to call, from Broome, a place some five miles off. 
Broome was also a great house, as he gathered, and Lady 
Marchant, the mother, was the wife of a county magnate. 
She explained that they had come in on the persuasion of 
the butler, who had represented the return of the Princess 
as imminent, and who then had administered tea without 
waiting for this event. The evening had drawn in chill ; 
there was a fire in the hall, and they all sat near it, round 
the tea-table, under the great roof which rose to the top of 
the house. Hyacinth conversed mainly with one of the 
daughters, a very fine girl with a straight back and long 
arms, whose neck was encircled so tightly with a fur boa 
that, to look a little to one side, she was obliged to move 
her whole body. She had a handsome, inanimate face, 
over which the firelight played without making it more 
lively, a beautiful voice, and the occasional command of a 
few short words. She asked Hyacinth with what pack he 
hunted, and whether he went in much for tennis, and she 
ate three muffins. 

Our young man perceived that Lady Marchant and her 
daughters had already been at Medley, and even guessed 
that their reception by the Princess, who probably thought 
them of a tiresome type, had not been enthusiastic ; and 
his imagination projected itself, further still, into the motives 
which, in spite of this tepidity, must have led them, in 
consideration of the rarity of princesses in that country, to 



 

come a second time. The talk, in the firelight, while 
Hyacinth laboured, rather recklessly (for the spirit of the 
occasion, on his hostess's part, was passing into his own 
blood), with his muffin-eating beauty the conversation, 
accompanied with the light click of delicate tea-cups, was 
as well-bred as could be consistent with an odd, evident 
parti-pris of the Princess's to make poor Lady Marchant 
explain everything. With great urbanity of manner, she 
professed complete inability to understand the sense in 
which her visitor meant her thin remarks ; and Hyacinth 
was scarcely able to follow her here, he wondered so what 
interest she could have in trying to appear dense. It was 
only afterwards he learned that the Marchant family pro- 
duced a very peculiar, and at moments almost maddening, 
effect upon her nerves. He asked himself what would 
happen to that member of it with whom he was engaged 
if it should be revealed to her that she was conversing 
(how little soever) with a beggarly London artisan; and 
though he was rather pleased at her not having discovered 
his station (for he didn't attribute her brevity to this idea), 
he entertained a little the question of its being perhaps his 
duty not to keep it hidden from her, not to flourish in a 
cowardly disguise. What did she take him for or, rather, 
what didn't she take him for when she asked him if he 
hunted ? Perhaps that was because it was rather dark ; if 
there had been more light in the great vague hall she would 
have seen he was not one of themselves. Hyacinth felt 
that by this time he had associated a good deal with swells, 
but they had always known what he was and had been 
able to elect how to treat him. This was the first occasion 
on which a young gentlewoman had not been warned, and, 





as a consequence, he appeared to pass muster. He de- 
termined not to unmask himself, on the simple ground 
that he should by the same stroke betray the Princess. 
It was quite open to her to lean over and say to Miss 
Marchant, ' You know he's a wretched little bookbinder, 
earning a few shillings a week in a horrid street in Soho. 
There are all kinds of low things and I suspect even 
something very horrible connected with his birth. It 
seems to me I ought to mention it.' He almost wished 
she would mention it, for the sake of the strange, violent 
sensation of the thing, a curiosity quivering within him to 
know what Miss Marchant would do at such a pinch, and 
what chorus of ejaculations or, what appalled, irremediable 
silence would rise to the painted roof. The responsibility, 
however, was not his he had entered a phase of his des- 
tiny where responsibilities were suspended. Madame 
Grandoni's tea had waked her up ; she came, at every 
crisis, to the rescue of the conversation, and talked to the 
visitors about Rome, where they had once spent a winter, 
describing with much drollery the manner in which the 
English families she had seen there for nearly half a 
century (and had met, of an evening, in the Roman world) 
inspected the ruins and monuments and squeezed into the 
great ceremonies of the church. Clearly, the four ladies 
didn't know what to make of the Princess ; but, though 
they perhaps wondered if she were a paid companion, they 
were on firm ground in the fact that the queer, familiar, fat 
person had been acquainted with the Millingtons, the 
Bunburys and the Tripps. 

After dinner (during which the Princess allowed herself 
a considerable license of pleasantry on the subject of her 



 

recent visitors, declaring that Hyacinth must positively go 
with her to return their call, and must see their interior, 
their manner at home), Madame Grandoni sat down to the 
piano, at Christina's request, and played to her companions 
for an hour. The spaces were large in the big drawing- 
room, and our friends had placed themselves at a distance 
from each other. The old lady's music trickled forth dis- 
creetly into the pleasant dimness of the candlelight ; she 
knew dozens of Italian local airs, which sounded like the 
forgotten tunes of a people, and she followed them by a 
series of tender, plaintive German Lieder, awaking, without 
violence, the echoes of the high, pompous apartment. It 
was the music of an old woman, and seemed to quaver a 
little, as her singing might have done. The Princess, 
buried in a deep chair, listened, behind her fan. Hyacinth 
at least supposed she listened; at any rate, she never 
moved. At last Madame Grandoni left the piano and 
came toward the young man. She had taken up, on the 
way, a French book, in a pink cover, which she nursed 
in the hollow of her arm, and she stood looking at 
Hyacinth. 

' My poor little friend, I must bid you good-night. I 
shall not see you again for the present, as, to take your 
early train, you will have left the house before I put on 
my wig and I never show myself to gentlemen without it. 
I have looked after the Princess pretty well, all day, to 
keep her from harm, and now I give her up to you, for a 
little. Take the same care, I beg you. I must put myself 
into my dressing-gown ; at my age, at this hour, it is the 
only thing. What will you have? I hate to be tight,' 
pursued Madame Grandoni, who appeared even in her 





ceremonial garment to have evaded this discomfort suc- 
cessfully enough. ' Do not sit up late,' she added ; ' and 
do not keep him, Christina. Remember that for an active 
young man like Mr. Robinson, going every day to his work, 
there is nothing more exhausting than such an unoccupied 
life as ours. For what do we do, after all ? His eyes are 
very heavy. Basta /' 

During this little address the Princess, who made no 
rejoinder to that part of it which concerned herself, re- 
mained hidden behind her fan ; but after Madame Gran- 
doni had wandered away she lowered this emblazoned 
shield and rested her eyes for a while on Hyacinth. At 
last she said, ' Don't sit half a mile off. Come nearer to 
me. I want to say something to you that I can't shout 
across the room.' Hyacinth instantly got up, but at the 
same moment she also rose ; so that, approaching each 
other, they met half-way, before the great marble chimney- 
piece. She stood a little, opening and closing her fan; 
then she remarked, 'You must be surprised at my not 
having yet spoken to you about our great interest.' 

' No, indeed, I am not surprised at anything.' 

' When you take that tone I feel as if we should never, 
after all, become friends,' said the Princess. 

' I hoped we were, already. Certainly, after the kind- 
ness you have shown me, there is no service of friendship 
that you might ask of me ' 

' That you wouldn't gladly perform ? I know what you 
are going to say, and have no doubt you speak truly. But 
what good would your service do me if, all the while, you 
think of me as a hollow-headed, hollow-hearted trifler, be- 
having in the worst possible taste and oppressing you with 



 

her attentions? Perhaps you can think of me as what 
shall I call it ? as a kind of coquette.' 

Hyacinth demurred. 'That would be very conceited.' 

' Surely, you have the right to be as conceited as you 
please, after the advances I have made you ! Pray, who 
has a better one ? But you persist in remaining humble, 
and that is very provoking.' 

' It is not I that am provoking ; it is life, and society, 
and all the difficulties that surround us.' 

'I am precisely of that opinion that they are ex- 
asperating; that when I appeal to you, frankly, candidly, 
disinterestedly simply because I like you, for no other 
reason in the world to help me to disregard and surmount 
these obstructions, to treat them with the contempt they 
deserve, you drop your eyes, you even blush a little, and 
make yourself small, and try to edge out of the situation 
by pleading general devotion and insignificance. Please 
remember this : you cease to be insignificant from the 
moment I have anything to do with you. My dear fellow,' 
the Princess went on, in her free, audacious, fraternising 
way, to which her beauty and simplicity gave nobleness, 
' there are people who would be very glad to enjoy, in your 
place, that form of obscurity.' 

'What do you wish me to do?' Hyacinth asked, as 
quietly as he could. 

If he had had an idea that this question, to which, as 
coming from his lips, and even as being uttered with per- 
ceptible impatience, a certain unexpectedness might attach, 
would cause her a momentary embarrassment, he was 
completely out in his calculation. She answered on the 
instant : ' I want you to give me time ! That's all I ask of
