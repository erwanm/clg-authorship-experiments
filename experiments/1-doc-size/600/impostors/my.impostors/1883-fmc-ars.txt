 

"No," said I, coming forward and facing him. 
" But if you like you can fight me. I am your own 
age, and a better match." I would have fought 
him then and there, with the chairs, if he had liked. 

" Why should I fight you ? " he inquired, in some 
astonishment. " You strike me as a very peaceable 
person indeed." 

"Diavolo! do you expect me to stand quietly 
and hear you call my boy a scoundrel? What do 
you take me for, signore? Do you know that I 
am the last of the Conti Grandi, and as noble as any 
of you, and as fit to fight, though my hair is grey ? " 

" I knew, indeed, that one member of that illustri 
ous family survived in Rome," he answered gravely, 
" but I was not aware that you were he. I am glad 
to make your acquaintance, and I sincerely wish 
that you were the father of the young man who has 
married my daughter. If you were, I should be 
ready to arrange matters." He looked at me searchingly. 

" Unfortunately, I am not any relation of his," 
I answered. " His father and mother were peasants 
on my estate of Serveti, when it was still mine. 
They died when he was a baby, and I took care of 
him and educated him." 

"Yes, he is well educated," reflected the count, 
"for I examined him myself. Let us talk no more 
about fighting. You are quite sure that the marriage 
is legal." 

"Quite certain. You can do nothing, and any 
attempt would be a useless scandal. Besides, they 
are so happy, you do not know." 



 

" So happy, are they ? Do you think I am happy, 
too?" 

" A man has every reason to be so, when his daughter marries an honest man. It is a piece of good luck 
that does not happen often." 

" Probably from the scarcity of daughters who are 
willing to drive their fathers to distraction by their 
disobedience and contempt of authority," he said 
savagely. 

"No, from the scarcity of honest men," I said. 
" Nino is a very honest man. You may go from one 
end of Italy to the other, and not meet one like him." 

" I sincerely hope so," growled Lira. " Otherwise 
Italy would be as wholly unredeemed and unredeem 
able as you pretend that some parts of it are now. 
But I will tell you, Conte Grandi, you cannot walk 
across the street, in my country, without meeting a 
dozen men who would tremble at the idea of such 
depravity as an elopement." 

"Our ideas of honesty differ, sir," I replied. 
"When a man loves a woman, I consider it honest 
in him to act as though he did, and not to go and 
marry another for consolation, beating her with a 
thick stick whenever he chances to think of the first. 
That seems to be the northern idea of domestic felic 
ity." Lira laughed gruffly, supposing that my picture 
was meant for a jest. " I am glad you are amused," 
I added. 

"Upon my honour, sir," he replied, "you are so 
vastly amusing that I am half inclined to forgive my 
daughter's rashness, for the sake of enjoying your 
company. First you intrench yourself behind your 



 

furniture ; then you propose to fight me ; and now 
you give me the most original views upon love anc 
marriage that I ever heard. Indeed, I have cause to 
be amused." 

" I am happy to oblige you," I said tartly ; for I 
did not like his laughter. " So long as you confine 
your amusement to me, I am satisfied ; but pray avoid 
using any objectionable language about Nino." 

" Then my only course is to avoid the subject ? " 

" Precisely," I replied, with much dignity. 

" In that case I will go," he said. 

I was immensely relieved, for his presence was most 
unpleasant, as you may readily guess. He got upon 
his feet, and I showed him to the door with all courtesy. I expected that he would say something about 
the future before leaving me, but I was mistaken. 
He bowed in silence, and stumped down the steps 
with his stick. 

I sank into my armchair with a great sigh of relief, 
for I felt that, for me at least, the worst was over. 
I had faced the infuriated father, and I might now 
face anybody with the consciousness of power. I 
always feel conscious of great power when the danger 
is past. Once more I lit my cigar, and stretched myself out to take some rest. The constant strain on 
the nerves was becoming very wearing, and I knew 
well that on the morrow I should need bleeding and 
mallows tea. Hardly was I settled and comfortable 
when I heard that dreadful bell again. 

" This is the day of the resurrection indeed," cried 
Mariuccia frantically from the kitchen. 

And she hurried to the door. But I cannot describe to you the screams of joy and the strange 
sounds, between laughing and crying, which her leath 
ern throat produced when she found Nino and Hed- 
wig on the landing, waiting for admission. And when 
Nino explained that he had been married, and that 
this beautiful lady with the bright eyes and the golden 
hair was his wife, the old woman fairly gave way, and 
sat upon a chair in an agony of amazement and ad 
miration. But the pair came toward me, and I met 
them with a light heart. 

" Nino," said Hedwig, " we have not been nearly 
grateful enough to Signor Grandi for all he has done. 
I have been very selfish," she said penitently, turning 
to me. 

" Ah no, signora," I replied, for she was mar 
ried now, and no longer " signoriria," " it is never 
selfish of such as you to let an old man do you ser 
vice. You have made me very happy." And then I 
embraced Nino, and Hedwig gave me her hand, which 
I kissed in the old fashion. 

" And so this is your old home, Nino," said Hedwig presently, looking about her, and touching the 
things in the room, as a woman will when she makes 
acquaintance with a place she has often heard of. 
"What a dear room it is! I wish we could live 
here ! " How very soon a woman learns that " we " 
that means so much ! It is never forgotten, even 
when the love that bred it is dead and cold. 

" Yes," I said, for Nino seemed so enraptured, as 
he watched her, that he could not speak. "And 
there is the old piano, with the end on the boxes, 
because it has no leg, as I dare say Nino has often 
told you." 



 

"Nino said it was a very good piano," said she. 

" And indeed it is," he cried, with enthusiasm. " It 
is out of tune now, perhaps ; but it is the source of 
all my fortune." He leaned over the crazy instrument and seemed to caress it. 

" Poor old thing ! " said He d wig compassionately. 
"I am sure there is music in it still, the sweet 
music of the past." 

" Yes," said he, laughing, " it must be the music of 
the past, for it would not stand the music of the 
future/ as they call it, for five minutes. All the 
strings would break." 

Hedwig sat down on the chair before it, and her 
fingers went involuntarily to the keys, though she is 
no great musician. 

" I can play a little, you know, Nino," she said 
shyly, and looked up to his face for a response, not 
venturing to strike the chords. 

And it would have done you good to see how 
brightly Nino smiled and encouraged her little offer 
of music, he, the great artist, in whose life music 
was both sword and sceptre. But he knew that 
she had greatness also of a different kind, and he 
loved the small jewels in his crown as well as the 
glorious treasures of its larger wealth. 

"Play to me, my love," he said, not caring now 
whether I heard the sweet words or not. 

She blushed a little, nevertheless, and glanced at 
me ; then her fingers strayed over the keys, and 
drew out music that was very soft and yet very gay. 
Suddenly she ceased, and leaned forward on the desk 
of the piano, looking at him. 



 

"Do you know, Nino, it. was once my dream to be 
a great musician. If I had not been so rich I should 
have taken the profession in earnest. But now, you 
see it is different, is it not? " 

"Yes, it is all different now," he answered, not 
knowing exactly what she meant, but radiantly 
happy, all the same. 

"I mean," she said, hesitating "I mean that 
now that we are to be always together, what you 
do I do, and what I do you do. Do you under 
stand?" 

" Yes, perfectly," replied Nino, rather puzzled, but 
quite satisfied. 

" Ah no, dear," said she, forgetting my presence, 
and letting her hand steal into his as he stood, " you 
do not understand quite. I mean that so long as 
one of us can be a great musician it is enough, and I 
am just as great as though I did it all myself." 

Thereupon Nino forgot himself altogether, and 
kissed her golden hair. But then he saw me looking, for it was so pretty a sight that I could not help 
it, and he remembered. 

" Oh ! " he said, in a tone of embarrassment, I had 
never heard before. 

Then Hedwig blushed very much, too, and looked 
away, and Nino put himself between her and me, so 
that I might not see her. 

" Could you play something for me to sing, Hed 
wig ? " he asked suddenly. 

" Oh, yes ! I can play Spirto gentil, by heart," 
she cried, hailing the idea with delight. 

In a moment they were both lost, and indeed so 



 

was I, in the dignity and beauty of the simple melody. As he began to sing, Nino bent down to her, 
and almost whispered the first words into her ear. 
But soon he stood erect, and let the music flow from 
his lips, just as God made it. His voice was tired 
with the long watching and the dust and cold and 
heat of the journey ; but, as De Pretis said when he 
began, he has an iron throat, and the weariness only 
made the tones soft and tender and thrilling, that 
would perhaps have been too strong for my little 
room. 

Suddenly he stopped short in the middle of a note, 
and gazed open-mouthed at the door. And I looked, 
too, and was horrified; and Hedwig, looking also, 
screamed and sprang back to the window, over 
turning the chair she had sat on. 

In the doorway stood Ahasuerus Benoni, the Jew. 

Mariuccia had imprudently forgotten to shut the 
door when Hedwig and Nino came, and the baron 
had walked in unannounced. You may imagine the 
fright I was in. But, after all, it was natural 
enough that, after what had occurred, he as well 
as the count should seek an interview with me, to 
obtain what information I was willing to give. 

There he stood in his gay clothes, tall and thin 
and smiling as of yore, 



 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

NINO is a man for great emergencies, as I have 
had occasion to say, and when he realised who the 
unwelcome visitor was, he acted as promptly as 
usual. With a face like marble he walked straight 
across the room to Benoni and faced him. 

" Baron Benoni," he said in a low voice, " I warn 
you that you are most unwelcome here. If you 
attempt to say any word to my wife, or to force 
an entrance, I will make short work of you." 

Benoni eyed him with a sort of pitying curiosity 
as he made this speech. 

"Do not fear, Signor Cardegna. I came to see 
Signor Grandi, and to ascertain from him precisely 
what you have volunteered to tell me. You cannot 
suppose that I have any object in interrupting the 
leisure of a great artist, or the privacy of his very 
felicitous domestic relations. I have not a great 
deal to say. That is, I have always a great deal to 
say about everything, but I shall at present confine 
myself to a very little." 

" You will be wise," said Nino, " and you would 
be wiser if you confined yourself to nothing at all." 

"Patience, Signor Cardegna," protested Benoni. 
" You will readily conceive that I am a little out of 
breath with the stairs, for I am a very old man." 



 

" In that case," I said, from the other side of the 
room, " I may as well occupy your breathing time by 
telling you that any remarks you are likely to make 
to me have been forestalled by the Graf von Lira, 
who has been with me this morning." 

Benoni smiled, but both Hedwig and Nino looked 
at me in surprise. 

" I only wished to say," returned Benoni, " that I 
consider you in the light of an interesting phenome 
non. Nay, Signor Cardegna, do not look so fierce. 
I am an old man " 

" An old devil ! " said Nino, hotly. 

"An old fool!" said I. 

" An old reprobate ! " said Hedwig, from her cor 
ner, in deepest indignation. 

" Precisely," returned Benoni, smilingly. " Many 
people have been good enough to tell me so before. 
Thanks, kind friends ; I believe you with all my 
heart. Meanwhile, man, devil, fool, or reprobate, 
I am very old. I am about to leave Rome for St. 
Petersburg, and I will take this last opportunity of 
informing you that in a very singularly long life I 
have met with only two or three such remarkable 
instances as this of yours." 

" Say what you wish to say, and go," said Nino 
roughly. 

" Certainly. And whenever I have met with such 
an instance I have done my very utmost to reduce 
it to the common level, and to prove to myself that 
no such thing really exists. I find it a dangerous 
thing, however ; for an old man in love is likely to 
exhibit precisely the agreeable and striking peculiar 
ities you have so aptly designated." 



 

There was something so odd about his manner and 
about the things he said that Nino was silent, and 
allowed him to proceed. 

" The fact is," he continued, " that love is a very 
rare thing, nowadays, and is so very generally an 
abominable sham that I have often amused myself 
by diabolically devising plans for its destruction. 
On this occasion I very nearly came to grief myself. 
The same thing happened to me some time ago, 
about forty years, I should say, and I perceive that 
it has not been forgotten. It may amuse you to look 
at this paper, which I chance to have with me. Good- 
morning. I leave for St. Petersburg at once." 

" I believe you are really the Wandering Jew !" 
cried Nino, as Benoni left the room. 

" His name was certainly Ahasuerus," Benoni re 
plied from the outer door. " But it may be a coinci 
dence, after all. Good-bye." He was gone. 

I was the first to take up the paper he had thrown 
upon a chair. There was a passage marked with a 
red pencil. I read it aloud : 

"... Baron Benoni, the wealthy banker of St. 
Petersburg, who was many years ago an inmate of 
a private lunatic asylum in Paris, is reported to be 
dangerously insane in Rome." That was all. The 
paper was the Paris " Figaro." 

" Merciful Heaven ! " exclaimed Hedwig, " and I 
was shut up with that madman in Fillettino I " 

Nino was already by her side, and in his strong 
arms she forgot Benoni, and Fillettino, and all her 
troubles. We were all silent for some time. At 
last Nino spoke. 



 

"Is it true that the count was here this morning?" 
he asked, in a subdued voice, for the extraordinary 
visit and its sequel had made him grave. 

" Quite true," I said. " He was here a long time. 
I would not spoil your pleasure by telling you of it, 
when you first came." 

" What did he what did my father say ? " asked 
Hedwig presently. 

" My dear children," I answered, thinking I might 
well call them so, " he said a great many unpleasant 
things, so that I offered to fight him if he said any 
more." 

At this they both laid hold of me and began to 
caress me ; and one smoothed my hair, and the other 
embraced me, so that I was half smothered. 

"Dear Signor Grandi," cried Hedwig anxiously, 
" how good and brave you are ! " 

She does not know what a coward I am, you see, 
and I hope she will never find it out, for nothing was 
ever said to me that gave me half so much pleasure 
as to be called brave by her, the dear child ; and if 
she never finds out, she may say it again, some day. 
Besides, I really did offer to fight Lira, as I have 
told you. 

" And what is he going to do ? " asked Nino, in 
some anxiety. 

" I do not know. I told him it was all legal, and 
that he could not touch you at all. I also said you 
were staying at the hotel Costanzi, where he might 
find you, if he wished." 

" Oh ! Did you tell him that ? " asked Hedwig. 

"It was quite right," said Nino. "He ought 



 

to know, of course. And what else did you tell 
him?" 

"Nothing especial, Nino mio. He went away in 
a sort of ill temper because I would not let him 
abuse you as much as he pleased." 

" He may abuse me and be welcome," said Nino. 
" He has some right to be angry with me. But he 
will think differently some day." 

So we chatted away for an hour, enjoying the 
rest and the peace and the sweet sunshine of the 
Easter afternoon. But this was the day of inter 
ruptions. There was one more visitor to come, 
one more scene for me to tell you, and then I have 
done. 

A carriage drove down the street and seemed to 
stop at the door of my house. Nino looked idly out 
of the window. Suddenly he started. 

" Hedwig, Hedwig ! " he cried, " here is your father 
coming back ! " 

She would not look out, but stood back from the 
window, turning pale. If there were one thing she 
dreaded, it was a meeting with her father. All the 
old doubt as to whether she had done right seemed 
to come back to her face in a moment. But Nino 
turned and looked at her, and his face was so triumphant that she got back her courage, and clasping 
his hand bravely awaited what was to come. 

I myself went to the door, and heard Lira's slow 
tread on the stairs. Before long he appeared, and 
glanced up at me from the steps, which he climbed, 
one at a time, with his stick. 

" Is my daughter here ? " he asked as soon as he 



 

reached me ; and his voice sounded subdued, just 
as Nino's did when Benoni had gone. 

I conducted him into the room. It was the 
strangest meeting. The proud old man bowed 
stiffly to Hedwig, as though he had never before 
seen her. Nino and Hedwig also bent their heads, 
and there was a silence as of death in the sunny 
room. 

"My daughter," said Von Lira at last, and with 
evident effort, "I wish to have a word with you. 
These two gentlemen the younger of whom is now, 
as I understand it, your husband may well hear 
what I wish to say." 

I moved a chair so that he might sit down, but he 
stood up to his full height, as though not deigning 
to be older than the rest. I watched Hedwig, and 
saw how with both hands she clung to Nino's arm, 
and her lip trembled, and her face wore the look it 
had when I saw her in Fillettino. 

As for Nino, his stern, square jaw was set, and his 
brows bent, but he showed no emotion, unless the 
darkness in his face and the heavy shadows beneath 
his eyes foretold ready anger. 

"I am no trained reasoner, like Signer Grandi," 
said Lira, looking straight at Hedwig, "but I can say 
plainly what I mean, for all that. There was a good 
old law in Sparta, whereby disobedient children were 
put to death without mercy. Sparta was a good 
country, very like Prussia, but less great. You 
know what I mean. You have cruelly disobeyed me, 
cruelly, I say, because you have shown me that 
all my pains and kindness and discipline have been 



 

in vain. There is nothing so sorrowful for a good 
parent as to discover that he has made a mistake." 

The canting old proser, I thought, will he never 
finish ! 

" The mistake I refer to is not in the way I have 
dealt with you," he went on, " for on that score I 
have nothing to reproach myself. But I was mis 
taken in supposing you loved me. You have de 
spised all I have done for you." 

" Oh, father ! How can you say that ? " cried poor 
Hedwig, clinging closer to Nino. 

"At all events, you have acted as though you did. 
On the very day when I promised you to take signal 
action upon Baron Benoni, you left me by stealth, 
saying in your miserable letter that you had gone to 
a man who could both love and protect you." 

"You did neither the one nor the other, sir," said 
Nino boldly, "when you required of your daughter 
to marry such a man as Benoni." 

"I have just seen Benoni; I saw him also on the 
night you left me, madam," he looked severely at 
Hedwig, " and I am reluctantly forced to confess 
that he is not sane, according to the ordinary standard 
of the mind." 

We had all known from the paper of the suspicion 
that rested on Benoni's sanity, yet somehow there 
was a little murmur in the room when the old count 
so clearly stated his opinion. 

" That does not, however, alter the position in the 
least," continued Lira, "for you knew nothing of 
this at the time I desired you to marry him, and I 
should have found it out soon enough to prevent mis- 



 

chief. Instead of trusting to my judgment, you took 
the law into your own hands, like a most unnatural 
daughter, as you are, and disappeared in the night 
with a man whom I consider totally unfit for you, 
however superior," he added, glancing at Nino, " he
