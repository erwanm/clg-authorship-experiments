lying upon the table, and studied the aspects of the weath- 
er in a dreamy fashion. 

Ten minutes perhaps elapsed before she returned. Elea- 
nor sat on her mother's footstool, her face half hidden on 
the friendly shoulder bowed for her support. 

" O, Nelly," exclaimed Madge, " what has happened ? 
Or if I interrupt " 

Eleanor stretched out her hand, and Madge drew near. 

" O, Madge, my darling, if it had only been you !" sh 
Ittered, tremulously, with a sob in her voice. 




"If what had been ?" asked Madge, in surprise. 

For a moment or two there was silence. Mrs. Ashbur 
ton looked exceedingly distressed. 

"I think I can guess," began Madge, slowly. "It is 
about Mr. Wyverne." 

Still there was no answer. 

"He loves you;" with a quiver of joy in her voice. 

"If it had not been!" 

"Why, Nelly?" Madge knelt beside her and twined 
ner arm around the drooping form. " He is a noble, gen- 
erous, and refined gentleman, with a high, tender, and 
chivalrous soul. I suspected it when Jessie and I returned 
from the West." 

" How blind I have been ! But then mamma has shared 
the same hope." 

" That he cared for me ? " 

Madge's face was scarlet. 

" Why not? You like and approve him." 

" But Mamma, Nelly, I think this is just right. It 
has given me a little secret joy all the time. Why should 
not Nelly be happy with a man so eminently fitted for 
her ? Their tastes, feelings, and acquirements harmonize 
BO perfectly! for Mr. Wyverne has none of the narrow 
jealousy one often finds in musical people. He is not 
rich, to be sure ; but he is a fine musician, and is gaining 
fame as a composer. But we have learned that happiness 
does not depend upon wealth." 

" He always appeared fond of you, I thought." 

" Nonsense ! " and Madge laughed. " He is interested 
in what he calls my genius; but endless discussion on 
stained-glass windows, and all their belongings, is not 
love. He likes us all, especially little Greta. O, Nelly, it 
is just right, unless you have some scruples about second 
marriages." 

Eleanor's face flushed a painful crimson. 

"Mamma, persuade her. Miss Wyverne loves her like a 
sister already. Greta could never have a tenderer father.' 





Eleanor rose. "It has surprised and bewildered me so 
much !" she said, slowly. "I had never even thought of 
it. I feel as if I was hardly worthy of such boundless 
trust, such loyal regard." 

Greta ran through the hall calling "Mamma!" and 
Eleanor went out to meet her child, taking her off to her 
own room. Madge studied her mother with an amused 
smile, asking presently, 

"Are you disappointed because Mr. Wyverne has 
chosen the one who suited him best?" 

" My dear, not that exactly," said her mother, in some 
perplexity. 

Madge took the vacated seat and leaned upon her 
mother's knee. 

" Have you any scruples as to my remaining a spin- 
ster?" she asked, almost gayly. 

" Madge," in a half sad, uncertain tone, " your happi- 
ness must always be my first desire." 

"Do you think me unhappy?" 

There was a sweet seriousness in her voice. 

" We have never spoken of this since that fatal day. 
Madge, you have kept your secret locked in your own 
soul, and one could only suspect your pangs. That they 
have been deep, I know ; that you will forget, I trust." 

"It was a very, very hard fight, mamma;" and Madge 
hid her face, while her voice faltered a little. "I had 
come to depend upon him for so much happiness and 
comfort ! I endured my toil and privations with a proud, 
courageous spirit, dreaming how they would be crowned 
at last. I did love him. All that part of my heart seems 
like something laid away in the grave, sacredly, never to 
be disturbed." 

" My darling " 

" Let me go on," pursued the soft, clear voice. " I am 
no weak, love-sick girl. There was a long while when it 
teemed to me that the glory had faded out of heaven 



 

and earth, when I almost lost sight of God ; but in hia 
great mercy he brought me back, and showed me that ' no 
man liveth unto himself, and no man dieth unto himself.' 
I found my work again, and my worship. When I dropped 
all vain striving and self-delusion, all clinging to idols of 
men's hands, God reached out his, and drew me to the 
light. Since then I have been content, happy." 

" And you have forgotten " 

Mrs. Ashburton raised her child's face, and studied it 
tenderly. 

"There are some things that never can be forgotten, 
mamma ;" with the voice still soft and clear. " But I feel 
now that the wrong was very deep. He sinned against 
me bitterly; let me go on loving and trusting when he 
was growing into another affection ; for I will not think 
so meanly of him as to suppose he was won by wealth. I 
put him out of my life because he is no longer worthy 
to remain in it, and have learned to pass him by as a 
stranger. But you, dear, and papa must accept the offer- 
ing that I shall strive to render purer and better each 
day. I will not say now that I never shall marry, but it 
will be a long while before I can dream any new dreams. 
So I am glad it was Nelly, and not I, whom Mr. Wy- 
verne fancied. You will need a home-daughter in the 
years to come, and I shall be here to fill the place. Miss 
Wyverne lives a good, sweet, wholesome life, and I am 
sure that dear Hetty Bright is worthy to be ranked the 
foremost among women. So I hope I shall not be quite 
wasted !" 

She raised her fearless eyes, shining with a few stray 
tears. There were strength, and tenderness, and honor, 
and the deeper loyalty to God, who was to be first and 
best in all the years to come. 

Mrs. Ashburton kissed the warm, bright lips. No pale 
hadows lurked about the face now. 

" So we shall be very happy, mamma." 





Eleanor revolved her question in sore perplexity 
especially as the knowledge grew upon her that her in- 
most heart was not wholly indifferent to the man who had 
thus hastily bespoken her warmest regard. The thought 
of a second marriage had never crossed her mind. It 
aeemed so much more probable that she would be the 
stay and solace of her parents' declining years, and these 
words had disturbed the tranquil sources of quiet life. 

But if Mr. Wyverne could not be a lover, he insisted 
upon a friend's place in the household. With fine tact 
he managed to render Eleanor at ease with him once 
more, and a casual observer would hardly suspect that a 
word had been uttered. 

Yet Eleanor felt that the current was against her. 
Every one appeared to acknowledge his right in a tacit 
manner. She could hardly hope to find a person whose 
tastes and requirements harmonized more perfectly with 
hers. She had come to the deeper knowledge of her 
needs, her sources of strength and weakness. The one 
found a sure support in his clear, steady soul ; the other 
seemed to clasp tendrils with what was most noble and 
manly in him. One of the blessed and satisfactory lives 
opened before her, whose glory would blot out that imper- 
fect, mistaken past. But still she would wait. 

So another spring began to dawn over them. Clement 
would be home in the summer, and in the ensuing autumn 
Mr. Graham purposed to set up a household altar of his 
own in the city, since their number had swelled from two 
to four, and he begged that they would all consider it a 
second home. 

Madge was busy enough with her duties and the two 
babies, though Greta was oftener a companion. She man- 
aged to visit Miss Hetty nearly every day, and poor Jenny 
Yates used to watch with a strange longing for the light, 
familiar step and breezy voice, like a waft of air fresh from 
the upland. 



 

Paler, thinner, a little weaker every day, a shortness of 
breath, a feebler clasp of the fingers, and a touch of some- 
thing strangely sweet, yet awesome, in the smile, a flutter 
hovering in the faint, wandering tones. 

Madge kept flowers in her room, and brought her many 
delicacies. She did not think it tiresome to listen or to 
talk, though the subject might be simple and the ideas 
vague or unformed. 

" What is it ? " she asked, one evening, as the wistful eyes 
followed her about, an unexpressed longing in their depth. 

" I hate to have you go, Miss Ashburton. You never 
staid here all night did you ? " 

" Not since it has been altered." 

"Did you before?" 

" O, yes once. I made a visit here when I was hard- 
ly grown, a year after we left Home Nook. And I slept 
in this room my sister Jessie and I." 

" Did you ? " with a faint, pleased smile. " How lovely 
it must have been to come back, Miss Ashburton ! " 

There had been mingled pleasure and pain in the return 
at first, and one of the old pangs, rarely felt now, crossed 
Madge's heart. 

" For it is so beautiful even here ! No one but God 
could have led Miss Hetty to open her house and take in 
the poor and miserable. I have had such peaceful days 
here ! Miss Ashburton do you think that the end 
may be near?" 

O, Jenny!" 

" I wonder a little about it on days like this when I have 
no pain especially since the spring has come in. Every 
night I seem a little weaker, and heaven closes around me 
as the twilight drops down. I've never done anything for 
God " 

"Except to bear this long, wearisome sickness pa- 
tiently." 

"I am afraid I have not always. It does not seem 





much virtue to be patient in a place like this, where everj 
one has a smile and a kind word for you. I used to give 
poor Mary a good deal of trouble, longing for things that 
I could not have. She didn't want Mr. Maurice to come, 
you know, and the singing and praying fretted her. May- 
be it does seem foolish, when one is strong and well, and 
has so much work to do ; but I always loved it. You'll 
tell her some time that I was sorry for every quick word, 
and for all that looked like ingratitude." 

"My dear girl, yes. I am glad that you feel so 
tranquil." 

" Why shouldn't I ? God has been so good to me at 
the last ! If Miss Hetty never did anything else, her care 
of me would be enough. O, Miss Ashburton, since I have 
enjoyed this comfort, I've thanked God daily that he has 
put it in the hearts of some to care for the sick and the 
needy. They cannot have much rest in their own forlorn 
homes." 

" Yes, Miss Hetty's idea was worthy of her generous 
heart. No one could have made a wiser or better use of a 
fortune." 

a O, Miss Ashburton, if you only wouldn't go I " 

The eyes were full of pleading light. 

Madge smiled. " Do you want me to stay so much ?" 

"I feel as if I didn't want you to go away to-night. 
You seem like a bit of sunshine after the day is done, you 
are so bright and sweet. And somehow " 

Madge glanced at the worn face. Four and twenty 
only a trifle older than herself. What had her griefs, and 
sorrows, and wounds been, compared with these weary 
years? Should she grudge one night to this poor girl ? 

" I will stay if you desire it, Jenny." 

a O, thank you ! thank you ! " 

By and by, Catharine brought up some supper. Jenny 
fancied that she did not want any, but Madge fed her a 
little jelly. Then she went down herself and took tea 
with Miss Hetty. 



 

" Catharine thinks Jenny will not last much longer." 

Madge started. Death was a vague idea to her of 
Bomething that might happen days hence. 

"But the poor child is ready any moment. I never 
saw any one so grateful, and I am so glad she was brought 
here. Sick people cannot have many comforts in such 
poor homes, even when those around them do their bestj 
and Mrs. Brown is an untidy termagant. She was so 
afraid to have Jenny dependent on charity, and yet she 
has never sent her a sixpence worth since she has been 
here. "Not that I care, though ; " with an odd smile. 

Yet for all this kindness, Mrs. Brown was continually 
saying ungracious things about the " old maid's ruin," as 
she termed it. " Miss Hetty looked fine, sticking herself 
up for a public benefactor. It was a great thing to have 
so much money that you didn't know what to do with it." 

Miss Hetty did not mind that, nor sundry other un- 
friendly criticisms. Here were work, duty, and the reward 
of a good conscience. Better far than be setting up for 
fine ladyhood and ease, when that would be quite foreign 
to her nature. 

Madge went up to Jenny presently. Through the soft 
May twilight they talked of the other country, of the love 
that purifies and exalts, giving courage to the trembling 
soul as it nears the solemn shore. Mrs. Farrand came in, 
and the two sang afterwards dear old hymns that make 
melody at the very gate of heaven. 

" I am going to sleep in the next room, Miss Ashbur- 
ton," said Catharine. " Miss Hetty says that by and by 
you had better come down with her." 

" When I am tired," returned Madge. 

Jenny slipped the wasted fingers within those so firm 
and warm. Darker grew the night for a while, and then 
the moon began to thread her path among the stars 
There was no continuous talking now, but fragments of 
sentences and precious promises. 





And through the pauses some old remembrance! 
thronged to Madge's busy brain. How long ago it seemed 
since she was the happy girl who had slumbered here so 
unconsciously ! What had God meant by giving her a brief 
taste of the cup of joy? That she should learn how many 
things some souls miss forever how that, in some lives, 
there is no spring and no summer? Perhaps. To turn 
the wild, untrained blossoms into tender graces, to take 
away the support to which she might cling, BO that, liko 
the palm, she could grow into steady self-reliance. 

Jenny dozed quietly. Madge at length leaned her head 
over on the pillow in a vague, dreamy mood. Once she 
had fancied her work almost done, and would have been 
content to die now she was glad to live. The world 
was bright and busy again. 

She started suddenly. Jenny clasped her hand tighter. 

"O," she murmured, "don't leave me! I want you to 
go clear to heaven's gate. ' Him that cometh to me I will 
in no wise cast out.' " 

" It is the invitation of the King of Glory." 

Yes." 

There was a little shudder, a strange clinging to the 
brave, steady hand. Madge bent over and pressed her 
lips to the forenead. After that, a kind of awesome, mid 
night silence. 

Catharine, hearing the stir, came in presently. 

" Had you not better go down to Miss Hetty ? " she 
whispered, softly. 

" No, I promised to stay. She is quiet, and has not ap- 
peared to suffer any." 

" She will never suffer again." 

As Madge raised her hand in surprise, the nerveless 
fingers slipped away. And she knew then that Jenny had 
passed over the river. All the sting of pain and sin had 
been taken out of this last moment. 

"Unto God we commend her," said Catharine, gentlj 



 

raising Madge. " Go down to Miss Hetty, but do not 
disturb any one else." 

The moonlight was streaming in all the windows. How 
wide and lonesome the world seemed for the sake of the 
one soul which had gone out of it! 

Miss Hetty took her in and soothed the throbbing 
pulses, gathering her to her fond, capacious heart. For the 
whole world was of kin to her now, and children would 
praise her who had never called her mother. Is the love 
of such women wasted ? Is their household a failure ? 

They missed Jenny Yates sadly. Her exceeding pa- 
tience and thankfulness had seemed to make a sunny spot 
in the house. Granny Bristow mourned her like a child 
perhaps more deeply than her own sister. 

" One gets so attached to them," said Miss Hetty, be- 
tween a sob and a smile, " that one hates to let them go. 
But with all our eflforts, we can never quite make a 
heaven." 

If we could, we should hardly need the other country. 
And therefore our works and affections here must needs 
be imperfect. 







CHAPTER XXIV. 

BETWEEN TWO. 

IT was a lovely June morning. Madge Ashburton had 
brought the roses to her cheeks by her work among the 
flowers, though they were seldom missing now. Her 
father enjoyed this companionship so much the sights 
and sounds, the fragrance and beauty, and the bright face 
of his darling ! It was such a blessed thing to have the 
world opening before him! Now and then he would 
pause in some labor of love and bow his head reverently, 
remembering the old apostolic injunction, " In everything 
give thanks." 

A strange man came up the walk, looking about a little 
uncertainly. 

" Can I see Miss Madge Ashburton ? " he asked. 

" I am Miss Ashburton," was the answer. 

"I was told to deliver this note into your hands." 

She pulled off her garden-glove, and took the dainty 
missive with its creamy envelope and antique monogram. 

" Do you wish an answer ? " 

"No, I think not. I was just to give it to you ; " and 
the man bowed. 

Very well." 

She watched him as he wound round in the line of the 
green, overhanging shrubbery. 

"A stylish invitation, papa," she said, laughingly. "We 
are quite grand again." 

But she ran up stairs to wash her hands and study tn 
lotters a little while. It is so pleasant to wonder a momeut 
what the secret is that you hold in your hand I 



 

A very brief note, with a signature that turned Madge's 
bright face ashen pale " May Westlake." The words 
blurred together before her eyes. 

" Will Madge Ashburton, who has pity upon all poor, 
sick, and unfortunate souls, come to one who needs her 
sorely, who cries unto her out of the depths of anguish ? 

"MAT WESTLAKE." 

For many minutes the request seemed to signify nothing 
to her as it floated to her brain. Was it real ? Why did 
May Westlake, in the midst of her luxury and happiness, 
need her f She had taken the love while Madge sat in 
the shadow. 

Then she rose and went to her mother. 

" I do not seem to understand it," she said, huskily. 
" Why should she want me ? " 

Mrs. Ashburton's first feeling was deep regret that the 
current of her daughter's life, growing so serene, should 
be broken up again by any tumultuous waves. Then her 
natural kindliness and pity conquered. 

" She does want you, it seems, and I suppose you can 
hardly refuse," said the mother, with a sigh. 

" You think I must go then ? " as if half hoping for sorae 
reprieve. 

Mrs. Ashburton studied the note. The hand that penned 
it was tremulous with mental distress or physical weak 
ness. Yet why should she ask this hard thing ? 

" O, mamma, I cannot ! " and Madge buried her face on 
her mother's bosom. " It is too much ! " 

Mrs. Ashburton was in a sore strait. It was a cruel re- 
quest. Yet what if it were sickness unto death ? 

" Tell me to stay. She has so much all ! What <sa* 
she want of my peace ? " 

" My darling ! God give you strength to decide," the 
mother faltered. 

IN it a duty?" 

 





" I dare not say that it is not. If she should be ill * 

" O, what could I say ? Does God see all ? Is h His 
work ? For if it is, I dare not refuse." 

Madge raised her head, but her whole frame trembled 
violently. She gave her mother one look of wordless 
pathos. Through all the dreary time of trial no pang had 
been quite so bitter. 

" Perhaps it would be best." 

The words were wrung from Mrs. Ashburton reluctantly 

" I cannot realize it. May Westlake, with everything at 
her feet, praying to me, asking this pitiful favor ! And I 
going in bonds as it were, knowing not what may befall 
me." 

They parted quivering fingers, and Madge went to her 
room. Some impulse stronger than her pain urged her 
forward. But, after she had made herself ready, she re- 
turned to her mother with an undecided expression still 
upon her face, and a strange thinking in her eyes. 

"My darling," Mrs. Ashburton said, " I cannot let you 
go without a word of warning. It may be that this young 
wife has failed to fill the heart of a husband, who, perhaps, 
is swayed by variable moods. Women are often unwit- 
tingly cruel to each other in these cases, keeping to the 
strict letter of the law, but losing sight of the spirit. Be 
merciful to her. In any event, it is too late even for 
friendship."
