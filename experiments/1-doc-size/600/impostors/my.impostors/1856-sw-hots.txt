"I will tell whomsoever it may concern to know, at any time
when I see occasion," she answered. "It is not a thing to be
ashamed of; and I will neither do nor think anything I am
unwilling to own."

"You had better reform public opinion in the first place,"
said Mr. Haye dryly.

"Why?" she said with startling quickness.

"It is apt to hold rather light of young ladies who tell their
minds without being asked."

"How can you speak so, father! -- I said, when I saw occasion --
it seems I have very much misjudged in the present instance."

"And as that might happen again," said Mr. Haye, "it is just
as safe, on the whole, that the person in question does not
come here any more. I am glad that I have advertised his place
for sale."

"What!" exclaimed Elizabeth and Rose both at once.

"Hush -- don't fire at a man in that way. His father's place, I
should say."

"What have you done to it?" said Elizabeth.

"Advertised it for sale. You don't hear me as well as you do
Mr. Satterthwaite, it seems."

"How come you to have it to sell?"

"Because it was mortgaged to me -- years ago -- and I can't get
either principal or interest; so I am taking the best way I
can to secure my rights."

"But Mr. Landholm was your friend?"

"Certainly -- but I am a better friend to myself. Can't do
business with your friends on different principles from those
you go upon with other people, Lizzie."

Elizabeth looked at him, with eyes that would have annihilated
a large portion of Mr. Haye's principles, if they had been
sentient things. Rose began a running fire of entreaties that
he would have nothing to do with Shahweetah, for that she
could not bear the place. Elizabeth brought her eyes back to
her plate, but probably she still saw Mr. Haye there, for the
expression of them did not change.

"I'm not going to have anything to do with the place, Rose,"
said Mr. Haye -- "further than to get it off my hands. I don't
want to live there any more than you do. All I want to do is
to pay myself."

"Father," said Elizabeth looking up quietly, "I'll buy it of
you."

"You!" said Mr. Haye, -- while Rose went off into a succession
of soft laughs.

"Do you care who does it, so that you get the money?"

"No, -- but what will you do with it?"

"Find a way, in time, of conveying it back to its right
owners," said Rose. "Don't you see, Mr. Haye?"

Elizabeth favoured her with a look which effectually spiked
that little gun, for the time, and turned her attention again
to her father.

"Do you care who buys it of you, so that you get the money?"

"Why, no -- but you don't want such a piece of property,
Lizzie."

"I want just such a piece of property."

"But my child, you can't manage it. It would be an absurd
spending of your money. There's a farm of two or three hundred
acres -- more, -- besides woodland. What could you do with it?"

"Trust me to take care of my own. May I have it, father?"

"Mr. Haye! --" Rose put in, pouting and whimpering, -- "I wish
you'd tell Lizzie she's not to look at me so! --"

"Will you sell it to me?" pursued Elizabeth.

"If you'll promise it shall not go back to the original owners
in any such way as Rose hinted."

"Are those your terms of sale?" said Elizabeth. "Because,
though I may not choose to submit myself to them, I can find
you another purchaser."

"What do you want of a great piece of land like that?"

"Nothing; I want the land itself."

"You can't do anything with it."

"It don't signify, if it all grows up to nettles!" said
Elizabeth. "Will you take the money of me and let me take the
land of you?"

"Hum --" said Mr. Haye, -- "I think you have enlightened me too
much this morning. No -- I'll find a more disinterested
purchaser; and let it teach you to take care of your eyes as
well as your tongue."

Rose bridled. Mr. Haye got up leisurely from the breakfast-
table and was proceeding slowly to the door, when his path was
crossed by his daughter. She stood still before him.

He might well tell her to take care of her eyes. They glowed
in their sockets as she confronted him, while her cheek was as
blanched as a fire at the heart could leave it. Mr. Haye was
absolutely startled and stood as still as she.

"Father," she said, "take care how you drive me too far! You
have had some place in my heart, but I warn you it is in
danger. -- If you care for it, I warn you! -- "

She was gone, like a flash; and Mr. Haye after casting a sort
of scared look behind him at his wife, went off too; probably
thinking he had got enough for one morning.

No doubt Elizabeth felt so for her part. She had gone to her
own room, where she put herself on a low seat by the window
and sat with labouring breath and heaving bosom, and the fire
in her heart and in her eyes glowing still, though she looked
now as if it were more likely to consume herself than anybody
else. If herself was not present to her thoughts, they were
busy with nothing then present; but the fire burned.

While she sat there, Clam came in, now one of the smartest of
gay-turbaned handmaidens, and began an elaborate dusting of
the apartment. She began at the door, and by the time she had
worked round to Elizabeth at the window, she had made by many
times a more careful survey of her mistress than of any piece
of furniture in the room. Elizabeth's head had drooped; and
her eyes were looking, not vacantly, but with no object in
view, out of the window.

"I guess you want my friend here just now, Miss 'Lizabeth,"
said Clam, her lips parting just enough to show the line of
white between them.

"Whom do you mean by your friend?"

"O -- Governor Landholm, to be sure -- he used to fix everybody
straight whenever he come home to Wuttle Quttle."

Elizabeth passed over the implication that she wanted
'fixing,' and asked, "How? --"

"I don' know. He used to put 'em all in order, in less'n no
time," said Clam, going over and over the dressing-table with
her duster, as that piece of furniture kept her near her
mistress. "Mis' Landholm used to get her face straight the
minute his two feet sounded outside the house, and she'd keep
it up as long as he stayed; and Winifred stopped to be queer
and behaved like a Christian; and nobody else in the house
hadn't a chance to take airs but himself."

"What sort of airs did he take?" said Elizabeth.

"O I don' know," said Clam; -- "his sort; -- they wa'n't like
nobody else's sort."

"But what do you mean by airs?"

"Can't tell," said Clam, -- "nothin' like yours, Miss
'Lizabeth, -- I take a notion to wish he was here, once in a
while -- it wouldn't do some folks no harm."

"Didn't his coming put you in order too?"

Clam gave a little toss of her head, infinitely knowing and
satisfied at the same time, and once more and more broadly
shewed the white ivory between her not unpretty parted teeth.

"I think you want putting in order now," said her mistress.

"Always did," said Clam with a slight arch of her eyebrows, --
"always shall. Best get him to manage it, Miss 'Lizabeth -- he
can do it quicker'n anybody else -- for me, -- and I dare say he
would for you."

"I don't believe you ever were put in order," said Elizabeth,
-- "to stay."

"I didn't use to do a wrong thing as long as he was in the
house!" said Clam. "Didn't want to. -- You wouldn't neither, if
you was in the house with him."

"What do you mean by Mrs. Landholm's getting her face straight
when he came? -- was'nt it always so?"

"'Twa'n't always so," said Clam, -- "for when he come, half
the wrinkles went away, and the grey hairs all turned black
again."

There came such a pang to Elizabeth's heart, such a gush to
her eyes, that she hid her face on her knees and heard nothing
of what her handmaid said for a long time after. If Clam
talked, she had the talk all to herself; and when Elizabeth at
last raised her head, her handmaiden was standing on the other
side of the fireplace looking at her, and probably making up
her mind that she wanted 'fixing' very much. There was no
further discussion of the subject, however; for Miss Haye
immediately called for her bonnet and veil, wrapped herself in
a light scarf and went out. The door had hardly closed upon
her when the bell rang again, and she came running up-stairs
to her room.

"Clam, get me the newspaper."

"What news, Miss 'Lizabeth?"

"All the newspapers -- every one you can find; -- yesterday's
and to-day's, or the day before."

Much wondering, Clam hunted the house and brought the fruits
of her search; and much more wondering, she saw her mistress
spend one hour in closely poring over the columns of page
after page; she who never took five minutes a day to read the
papers. At last a little bit was carefully cut from one of
those Clam had brought up, and Elizabeth again prepared
herself to go forth.

"If it had been Mr. Winthrop, now, who was doing that," said
Clam, "he'd have took off his hat most likely, and sat down to
it. How you do look, Miss 'Lizabeth!"

"Mr. Winthrop and I are two different people," said Elizabeth,
hurriedly putting on the one glove she had drawn off.

"Must grow a little more like before you'll be one and the
same," observed Clam.

Elizabeth let down her veil over her face and went out again.

With a quick nervous step she went, though the day was warm,
making no delay and suffering no interruption; till she
reached the University where Professor Herder made his daily
and nightly abode. The professor was attending one of his
classes. Elizabeth asked to be shewn to his room.

She felt as if she was on a queer errand, as she followed her
conductor up the wide stone stairs and along the broad
corridors, where the marks were evidently of only man's use
and habitation, and now and then a man's whistle or footstep
echoed from the distance through the halls. But she went on
swiftly, from one corridor to another, till the guide opened a
door and she stepped out from the public haunts of life to a
bit of quite seclusion.

It was a pleasant enough place that Mr. Herder called home. A
large, airy, light, high-ceiled apartment, where plainly even
to a stranger's eye, the naturalist had grouped and bestowed
around him all the things he best liked to live among.
Enormous glass cases, filled with the illustrations of
science, and not less of the philosopher's investigating
patience, lined all the room; except where dark-filled shelves
of books ran up between them from the floor to the ceiling. A
pleasant cloth-covered table, with books and philosophical
instruments, stood towards one side of the room, a little
table with a lamp at the other; and scattered about, all over,
were big stout comfortable well-worn leather arm-chairs, that
said study and learning sat easy there and often received
visits of pleasure in that room. Elizabeth felt herself as
little akin to pleasure as to learning or study, just then.
She put herself in one of the great leather chairs, with a
sense of being out of her element -- a little piece of busy,
bustling, practical life, within the very palings of science
and wisdom.

She sat and waited. But that pulse of busy life beat never the
cooler for all the cool aspect of the place and the grave
shade of wisdom that lingered there; nay, it throbbed faster
and more flutteringly. She got up to try the power of
distraction the glass cases might hold; but her eye roved
restlessly and carelessly over object and object of interest
that withheld its interest from her; and weariedly she went
back to her arm-chair and covered her face with her hands,
that her mind might be at least uninterruptedly busy in its
own way.

It must have been very busy, or the quick little step of the
German professor must have been very soft withal; for he had
come within a few feet of her before he knew who she was or
she knew that he was there.

"Miss Elisabet'!" he exclaimed with a most good-humoured face
of wonderment, -- "I never was so honoured before! How did you
get in my arm-chair?"

Elizabeth jumped up and shook hands with him, laughing in very
relief to see him come.

"How did I get here? -- I came up through the sun, Mr. Herder."

"I have asked you to come in better time," said the
naturalist, -- "that is, better for you -- dis is very good time
for me. I have nozing to do, and I will give you lesson in
whatever you want."

"No sir, -- I am come to give you a lesson, Mr. Herder."

"Me? Well, I will take it," said the naturalist, who began at
the same time to run about his room and open closet doors and
jingle glasses together, apparently on his own business, -- "I
like always to take lessons, -- it is not often that I have
such a teacher. I will learn the best I can -- after I have got
you some lemonade. I have two lemons here, -- somevere, -- ah! -- "

"I don't want it, Mr. Herder."

"I cannot learn nozing till you have had it," said Mr. Herder
bringing his lemons and glasses to the table; -- "that sun is
beating my head what was beating yours, and it cannot think of
nozing till I have had something to cool him off. --"

Elizabeth sat still, and looked, and thought, with her heart
beating.

"I did not know what was in my room when I see you in my chair
wiz your head down -- you must be study more hard than me, Miss
Elisabet' -- I never put my head down, for nozing."

"Nor your heart either, I wonder?" thought Elizabeth.

"I was studying, Mr. Herder, -- pretty hard."

"Is that what you are going to give me to study?" said the
naturalist.

"Not exactly -- it was something about it. I want you to do
something for me, Mr. Herder, -- if I may ask you, -- and if you
will be so very kind as to take some trouble for me."

"I do not like trouble," said the naturalist shaking his head
good-humouredly over a squeeze of his lemon; -- "dere is no use
in having trouble -- I get out of it so soon as I can -- but I
will get in it wiz pleasure for you, Miss Elisabet' -- what you
tell me -- if you will tell me if that is too much sucker."

"To take trouble, and to be in trouble, are not quite the same
thing, Mr. Herder," said Elizabeth, having at the moment a
vivid realization of the difference.

"I thought trouble was trouble," said the naturalist,
finishing the preparing his own glass of lemonade. "If you
will lesson me to find trouble is no trouble -- Miss Elisabet'
-- I will thank you much for that."

Elizabeth heartily wished anybody could teach her that
particular lesson. She sipped her lemonade, slowly and
abstractedly, busy yet with the study which Mr. Herder had
broken off; while he talked benignly and kindly, to ears that
did not hear. But the last of Elizabeth's glass was swallowed
hastily and the glass set down.

"Mr. Herder, I have come to ask you to do something for me."

"I am honoured, Miss Elisabet'," said the philosopher bowing.

"Will you not speak of it to anybody?"

"Not speak of it!" said the naturalist. "Then it is a secret?"

The quick energetic little bend of Elizabeth's head said
before her lips spoke the word, "Yes!"

"It is more honour yet," he said. "What am I to do, Miss
Elisabet'?"

"Nothing, if it will be any real trouble to you, Mr. Herder.
Promise me that first."

"Promise? -- what shall I promise?" said Mr. Herder.

"Promise me that if what I am going to ask would be any real
trouble to you or to your business, you will tell me so."

"I do not love to be troubled," said the naturalist. "It shall
not be no trouble to me."

"But promise me that you will tell me, Mr. Herder."

"Suppose you was to tell me first. I cannot tell nozing till I
know."

"You will not speak of it to anybody, Mr. Herder?"

"I will not speak of nozing, Miss Elisabet'."

"Mr. Herder, there is a piece of land which I want to buy; and
I have come to ask you, if you can, and if you will, to buy it
for me."

"Miss Elisabet'," said the naturalist looking a little
surprised at his fair questioner, -- "I will tell you the truth
-- I have no money."

"I have, Mr. Herder. But I cannot go into the market and buy
for myself."

"Cer-tain-ly, you cannot do that," said Mr. Herder. "But what
is it you wish to buy?"

"It is a farm, --" said Elizabeth, feeling glad that her back
was to the light; -- "it is a piece of land in the country -- up
on the Shatemuc river. I think you have been there, Mr.
Herder, -- it is the place where the Landholms' father lives.
Wut-a-qut-o, they call it -- or Shahweetah; -- Wut-a-qut-o is
the mountain opposite."

"Landholm!" cried the naturalist. "Is it Winthrop's place?"

Elizabeth bowed her head and answered, "His father's."

"Winthrop's place! Is that what you want, Miss Elisabet'?"

Elizabeth bowed her head again, this time without answering.

"Suppose they might not want to sell it?" said the naturalist.

"They do not -- but they can't help themselves. It must be sold
-- they can't pay money that is owing upon it."

"Money!" -- said the naturalist; -- "that is de trouble of all
that is in the world. I wish there was no such thing as money!
It makes all the mischief."

"Or the want of it," said Elizabeth.

"No!" said the naturalist, -- "it is not that! I have want
money all my life, Miss Elisabet', and I have never got into
no trouble at all."

"Except when you fought the duels, Mr. Herder."

"Dat was not no trouble!" said the philosopher. "There was
nozing about money there; and it was not no trouble, -- neizer
before, neizer after."

"I have had money all my life; and it never made me any
trouble."

"Ah, you have not come to the time," said Mr. Herder. "Wait,
you will find it. Now you are in trouble because you want to
buy this ground, and you could not do it wizout money."

"I can't do it with, unless you will help me, Mr. Herder -- you
or somebody."

"I could get somebody," said Mr. Herder; -- "I know somebody
what I could get."

"I don't know anybody who would be as good as you, sir."

"I do," said the naturalist. "Where is Mr. Haye? -- is he
sick?"

"No sir, -- I don't wish him to know anything about it, Mr.
Herder. -- He is the person making the sale."

"Your father? -- do you mean that Mr. Haye is the man what is
selling the ground of Mr. Landholm?"

"Yes sir. And I wish to buy it."

"Then Miss Elisabet', what for do you not ask my friend
Winthrop to buy it for you? He knows all business. He will do
it."

"I cannot -- I have not the liberty -- He is not enough a friend
of mine, for me to ask him such a favour."

"But Miss Elisabet', what will you do wiz all that large
ground and water?"

"Buy it, -- first, sir; and then I will see. I want it."

"I see you do," said the naturalist. "Well, then I shall get
it for you -- if I can -- I hope your money will not get me in
trouble."

"If you are at all afraid of that, Mr. Herder, I will find
some other way --"

"I never was afraid of nozing in my life, Miss Elisabet' --
only I do not know neizer how to get money, neizer how to
spend it -- in this way. What will Mr. Haye say to me when I go
to buy all this great land of him? He will say --"

"You're not to buy it of him, Mr. Herder."

"No?" said the naturalist. "Of who, then? I thought you said
he was going to sell it."

"Yes, he is -- but he has somebody else to do it for him. Here,
Mr. Herder, -- here is the advertisement; -- see -- don't read
the first part, -- all that has nothing to do with it, -- here
is the place. 'At the Merchant's Exchange, in the city of
Mannahatta, on the first day of September, 1821, at 12 o'clock
noon of that day' -- and then comes the description of the
place. It is to be sold at public auction."

"Auc-sion? --" said the naturalist.

"It's to be sold in public, to whoever offers to give most for
it."

"O, I know that," said Mr. Herder.

"And dear Mr. Herder, all I ask of you is to be there, at 12
o'clock the first of September, and buy it for me; and let
nobody know. Can you do it?"

"I can do so much," said the naturalist. "I think I can. But
suppose somebody will give more than you."

"Do not suppose that, sir. I will give more than anybody."

"Are you sure you will?" said the naturalist. "Maybe you do
not know."

"I do know, sir, and am sure."

"Well," said the naturalist, shaking his head, -- "I do not
know much about buying grounds -- I do know a leetle of some
things -- but I do not know what sort of a lesson is this, Miss
Elisabet'. But I will see if I can do it. Who is going to live
up there wiz you?"

"Don't you suppose I can live alone, Mr. Herder."

"No, not there," said the naturalist. "You want some one to
take care of you -- de engineer, Miss Elisabet'," said he
smiling.

Elizabeth made no answer; she had risen up to go; and he
guided her through the halls and down the staircases, till she
was in the open street again. Then, after a farewell squeeze
of his hand and nod of her little head, she pulled her veil
down and went homeward, more slowly than she had come.

"Do I want somebody to take care of me?" she thought. "I
believe I do! An engineer? -- I do not think the engine is
under very good guidance -- it is too strong for me -- How could
he know that? Oh what earthly thing would I give, for a hand
wise and strong enough to lead me, and good enough that I
could submit myself to!"

The wish was so deep drawn that her breast heaved with it, and
starting tears made her draw her veil thicker before them. She
bit her lip, and once more quickened her steps towards home.


CHAPTER III.


Then think I of deep shadows on the grass, --
Of meadows where in sun the cattle graze,
Where, as the breezes pass,
The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways, --
Of leaves that slumber in a cloudy mass,
Or whiten in the wind, -- of waters blue
That from the distance sparkle through
Some woodland gap, -- and of a sky above,
Where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move.
LOWELL.


Finding that the old farm must pass out of his hands, Mr.
Landholm made up his mind not to spend another summer of
labour and of life upon it; but at once with his son Asahel to
move off to the West. He stayed but to reap the standing crops
of winter grain, dispose of stock, and gather up all the loose
ends of business; and left the hills of the Shatemuc, to seek
better fortunes on a Western level.

They passed through Mannahatta on their way, that they might
have a short sight of Winthrop and Winifred and say good-bye
to them. It was not so joyful a visit that anybody wished it
to be a long one.

"It's pretty hard," said the farmer, "to start life anew again
at my time of day; -- but these arms are not worn out yet; I
guess they'll do something -- more or less -- on a new field."

"Asahel's got strong arms, father," said Winifred, who was
fain to put in a word of comfort when she could.
