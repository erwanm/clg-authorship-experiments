"All right, Hal — you can know anything you want; 
but for God's sake, not now ! If you want to be taken for 



 

& man, show a man's common sense! Here's Old Peter 
getting back to Western City to-morrow night ! Don't 
you know that he'll be after me, raging like a mad bull ? 
Don't you know that if I tell him I can do nothing — that 
Fve been down here and tried to pull you away — don't 
you know he'll go after Dad ? " 

Edward had tried all the arguments, and this was the 
only one that counted. " You must keep him away from 
Dad ! " exclaimed Hal. 

" You tell me that ! " retorted the other. " And when 
you know Old Peter! Don't you know he'll get at him, 
if he has to break down the door of the house? He'll 
throw the burden of his rage on that poor old man! 
You've been warned about it clearly; you know it may be 
a matter of life and death to keep Dad from getting ex- 
cited. I don't know what he'd do ; maybe he'd fly into a 
rage with you, maybe he'd defend you. He's old and 
weak, he's lost his grip on things. Anyhow, he'd not let 
Peter abuse you — and like as not he'd drop dead in the 
midst of the dispute ! Do you want to have that on your 
conscience, along with the troubles of your workingmen 
friends?" 



 Hal sat staring in front of him, silent. Was 
it a fact that every man had something in his life which 
palsied his arm, and struck him helpless in the battle for 
social justice ? 

When he spoke again, it was in a low voice. " Edward, 
I'm thinking about a young Irish boy who works in these 
mines. He, too, has a father ; and this father was caught 
in the explosion. He's an old man, with a wife and seven 
other children. He's a good man, the boy's a good boy. 
Let me tell you what Peter Harrigan has done to them ! " 

"Well," said Edward, "whatever it is, it's all right, 
you can help them. They won't need to starve." 



 

"I know," said Hal, "but there are so many others; 
I can't help them alL And besides, can't you see, Ed- 
ward — what I'm thinking about is not charity, but jus- 
tice* Fm sore this boy, Tim Bafferty, loves his father 
just exactly as much as I love my father; and there are 
other old men here, with sons who love them — " 

" Oh, Hal, for Christ's sake ! " exclaimed Edward, in 
a sort of explosion. He had no other words to express his 
impatience. ** Do you expect to take all the troubles in 
the world on your shoulders ? " And he sprang up and 
caught the other by the arm. " Boy, you've got to come 
away from here ! " 

Hal got up, without answering. He seemed irresolute, 
and his brother started to draw him towards the door. 
<   Ire got a car here. We can get a train in an hour — " 

Hal saw that he had to speak firmly. " No, Edward," 
he said. u I can't come just yet" 

" I tell vou vou must come ! " 

'' I can't* I made these men a promise ! " 

*    In God's name — what are these men to you ? Com- 
pared with your own father ! " 

'' I can't explain it, Edward. I've talked for half an 
hour, and I don't think you've even heard me. Suffice 
it to say that I see these people caught in a trap — and one 
that my whole life has helped to make. I can't leave 
them in it* What's more, I don't believe Dad would 
want me to do it, if he understood ' 

The other made a last effort at self-control. " I'm not 
going to call you a sentimental fool. Only, let me ask 
you one {Jain question. What do you think you can do 
for these people ! " 

'' I think I can help to win decent conditions for them." 

" Good God ! " cried Edward ; he sighed, in his agony 
of exasperation. "In Peter Harrigan's mines! Don't 
you realise that he'll pick them up and throw them out of 



 

here, neck and crop — the whole crew, every- man in the 
town, if necessary f " 

" Perhaps," answered Hal ; " but if the men in the other 
mines should join them — if the big union outside should 
stand by them — " 

" You're dreaming, Hal ! You're talking like a child ! 
I talked to the superintendent here; he had telegraphed 
the situation to Old Peter, and had just got an answer. 
Already he's acted, no doubt." 

" Acted ? " echoed Hal. " How do you mean ? " He 
was staring at his brother in sudden anxiety. 

" They were going to turn the agitators out, of course." 

" What? And while I'm here talking! " 

Hal turned toward the door. " You knew it all the 
time ! " he exclaimed. " You kept me here deliberately ! " 

He was starting away, but Edward sprang and caught 
him. " What could you have done ? " 

" Turn me loose ! " cried Hal, angrily. 

" Don't be a fool, Hal ! I've been trying to keep you 
out of the trouble. There may be fighting." 

Edward threw himself between Hal and the door, and 
there was a sharp struggle. But the elder man was no 
longer the athlete, the young bronzed god; he had been 
sitting at a desk in an office, while Hal had been doing 
hard labour. Hal threw him to one side, and in a mo- 
ment more had sprung out of the door, and was running 
down the slope. 



 Coming to the main street of the village, Hal 
saw the crowd in front of the office. One glance told 
him that something had happened. Men were running 
this way and that, gesticulating, shouting. Some were 
coming in his direction, and when they saw him they be- 
gan to yell to him. The first to reach him was Klowoski, 



 

the little Pole, breathless; gasping with excitement 
" They fire our committee! " 

"Fire them?" 

" Fire 'em out ! Down canyon ! " The little man was 
waving his arms in wild gestures; his eyes seemed about 
to start out of his head. " Take 'em off ! Whole bunch 
fellers — gunmen! People see them — come out back 
door. Got ever'body's arm tied. Gunmen fellers hold 
'em, don't let 'em holler, can't do nothin'l Grot them 
cars waitin' — what you call? — " 

" Automobiles ? " 

" Sure, got three ! Put ever'body in, quick like that — 
they go down road like wind ! Go down canyon, all gone! 
They bust our strike ! " And the little Pole's voice ended 
in a howl of despair. 

" No, they won't bust our strike ! " exclaimed HaL 
"Not yet!" 

Suddenly he was reminded of the fact that his brother 
had followed him — puffing hard, for the run had been 
strenuous. He caught Hal by the arm, exclaiming, 
" .Keep out of this, I tell you ! " 

Thus while Hal was questioning Klowoski, he was strug- 
gling half-unconsciously, to free himself from his brother's 
grasp. Suddenly the matter was forced to an issue, for 
the little Polack emitted a cry like an angry cat, and went 
at Edward with fingers outstretched like claws. Hal's 
dignified brother would have had to part with his dignity, 
if Hal had not caught Klowoski's onrush with his other 
arm. " Let him alone ! " he said. " It's my brother ! " 
Whereupon the little man fell back and stood watching in 
bewilderment. 

Hal saw Androkulos running to him. The Greek boy 
had been in the street back of the office, and had seen the 
committee carried off; nine people had been taken — 
Wauchope, Tim Eafferty, and Mary Burke, Marcelli, 
Zammakis and Busick, and three others who had served 






 

as interpreters on the night before. It had all been done 
so quickly that the crowd had scarcely realised what was 
happening. 

Now, having grasped the meaning of it, the men were 
beside themselves with rage. They shook their fists, shout- 
ing defiance to a group of officials and guards who were 
visible upon the porch of the office-building. There w flS 
a clamour of shouts for revenge. 

Hal could see instantly the dangers of the situation; 
he was like a man watching the burning fuse of a bomb. 
Now, if ever, this polyglot horde must have leadership — 
wise and cool and resourceful leadership. 

The crowd, discovering his presence, surged down upon 
him like a wave. They gathered round him, howling. 
They had lost the rest of their committee, but they still had 
Joe Smith. Joe Smith ! Hurrah for Joe ! Let the gun- 
men take him, if they could! They waved their caps, 
they tried to lift him upon their shoulders, so that all could 
see him. 

There was clamour for a speech, and Hal started to make 
his way to the steps of the nearest building, with Edward 
holding on to his coat. Edward was jostled; he had to 
part with his dignity — but he did not part with his 
brother. And when Hal was about to mount the steps, 
Edward made a last desperate effort, shouting into his ear, 
" Wait a minute ! Wait ! Are you going to try to talk 
to this mob    " 

" Of course. Don't you see there'll be trouble if I 
don't ? " 

" You'll get yourself killed ! You'll start a fight, and 
get a lot of these poor devils shot! Use your common 
sense, Hal ; the company has brought in guards, and they 
are armed, and your people aren't." 

" That's exactly why I have to speak ! " 

The discussion was carried on under difficulties, the 
elder brother clinging to the younger's arm, while the 



 

younger sought to pull free, and the mob shouted with a 
single voice, " Speech ! Speech ! " There were some 
near by who, like Klowoski, did not relish having this 
stranger interfering with their champion, and showed 
signs of a disposition to " mix in " ; so at last Edward gave 
up the struggle, and the orator mounted the steps and faced 
the throng. 



 Hal raised his arms as a signal for silence. 

" Boys," he cried, " they've kidnapped our committee. 
They think they'll break our strike that way — but they'll 
find they've made a mistake ! " 

" They will ! Right you are ! " roared a score of voices. 

" They forget that we've got a union. Hurrah for our 
North Valley union ! " 

" Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " The cry echoed to the canyon- 
walls. 

" And hurrah for the big union that will back us — the 
United Mine- Workers of America ! " 

Again the yell rang out ; again and again. " Hurrah 
for the union ! Hurrah for the United Mine- Workers ! " 
A big American miner, Ferris, was in the front of the 
throng, and his voice beat in Hal's ears like a steam-siren. 

" Boys," Hal resumed, when at last he could be heard, 
" use your brains a moment. I warned you they would 
try to provoke you ! They would like nothing better than 
to start a scrap here, and get a chance to smash our union ! 
Don't forget that, boys, if they can make you fight, they'll 
sinash the union, and the union is our only hope ! " 

Again came the cry : " Hurrah for the union ! " Hal 
let them shout it in twenty languages, until they were sat- 
isfied. 

" Now, boys," he went on, at last, " they've shipped out 
our committee. They may ship me out in the same 
way — " 



 

" No, they won't ! " shouted voices in the crowd. And 
there was a bellow of rage from Ferris. " Let them try 
it ! We'll burn them in their beds ! " 

" But they can ship me out ! " argued Hal. " You 
know they can beat us at that game ! They can call on the 
sheriff, they can get the soldiers, if necessary ! We can't 
oppose them by force — they can turn out every man, 
woman and child in the village, if they choosy What 
we have to get clear is that even that won't crush our union ! 
Nor the big union outside, that will be backing us ! We 
can hold out, and make them take us back in the end ! " 

Some of Hal's friends, seeing what he was trying to do, 
came to his support. " No fighting ! No violence ! 
Stand by the union ! " And he went on to drive the lesson 
home ; even though the company might evict them, the big 
union of the four hundred and fifty thousand mine-work- 
ers of the country would feed them, it would call out the 
rest of the workers in the district in sympathy. So the 
bosses, who thought to starve and cow them into submis- 
sion, would find their mines lying permanently idle. They 
would be forced to give way, and the tactics of solidarity 
would triumph. 

So Hal went on, recalling the things Olson had told him, 
and putting them into practice. He saw hope in their 
faces again, dispelling the mood of resentment and rage. 

" Now, boys," said he, " I'm going in to see the super- 
intendent for you. I'll be your committee, since they've 
shipped out the rest." 

The steam-siren of Ferris bellowed again: "You're 
the boy ! Joe Smith ! " 

" All right, men — now mind what I say ! I'll see the 
super, and then I'll go down to Pedro, where there'll be 
some officers of the United Mine-workers this morning. 
I'll tell them the situation, and ask them to back you. 
That's what you want, is it ? " 

That was what they wanted. " Big union ! " 



( 



 

" All right. I'll do the best I can for you, and I'll find 
some way to get word to you. And meantime you stand 
firm. The bosses will tell you lies, they'll try to deceive 
you, they'll send spies and trouble-makers among you — 
but you hold fast, and wait for the big union." 

Hal stood looking at the cheering crowd. He had time 
to note some of the faces upturned to him. Pitiful, toil- 
worn faces they were, each making its separate appeal, 
telling its individual story of deprivation and defeat 
Once more they were transfigured, shining with that 
wonderful new light which he had seen for the first time 
the previous evening. It had been crushed for a moment, 
but it flamed up again; it would never die in the hearts 
of men — once they had learned the power it gave. Noth- 
ing Hal had yet seen moved him so much as this new birth 
of enthusiasm. A beautiful, a terrible thing it was ! 

Hal looked at his brother, to see how he had been moved. 
What he saw on his brother's face was satisfaction, bound- 
less relief. The matter had turned out all right! Hal 
was coming away!

Hal turned again to the men ; somehow, after his glance 
at Edward, they seemed more pitiful than ever. For Ed- 
ward typified the power they were facing — the unseeing, 
uncomprehending power that meant to crush them. The 
possibility of failure was revealed to Hal in a flash of emo- 
tion, overwhelming him. He saw them as they would be, 
when no leader was at hand to make speeches to them. 
He saw them waiting, their life-long habit of obedience 
striving to reassert itself ; a thousand fears besetting them, 
a thousand rumours preying upon them — wild beasts set 
on them by their cunning enemies. They would suffer, 
not merely for themselves, but for their wives and chil- 
dren — the very same pangs of dread that Hal suffered 
when he thought of one old man up in Western City, whose 
doctors had warned him to avoid excitement. 

If they stood firm, if they kept their bargain with 



 

their leader, they would be evicted from their homes, they 
would face the cold of the coming winter, they would face 
hunger and the black-list. And he, meantime — what 
would he be doing? What was his part of the bargain? 
He would interview the superintendent for them, he would 
turn them over to the " big union " — and then he would 
go off to his own life of ease and pleasure. To eat grilled 
steaks and hot rolls in a perfectly appointed club, with 
suave and softly-moving servitors at his beck! To dance 
at the country club with exquisite creatures of chiffon and 
satin, of perfume and sweet smiles and careless, happy 
charms! No, it was too easy! He might call that his 
duty to his father and brother, but he would know in his 
heart that it was treason to life ; it was the devil, taking 
him onto a high mountain and showing him all the king- 
doms of the earth ! 

Moved by a sudden impulse, Hal raised his hands once 
more. " Boys," he said, " we understand each other now. 
You'll not go back to work till the big union tells you. 
And I, for my part, will stand by you. Your cause is my 
cause, I'll go on fighting for you till you have your rights, 
till you can live and work as men ! Is that right ? " 

"' That's right ! That's right ! " 

" Very good, then — we'll swear to it ! " And Hal 
raised his hands, and the men raised theirs, and amid a 
storm of shouts, and a frantic waving of caps, he made 
them the pledge which he knew would bind his own con- 
science. He made it deliberately, there in his brother's 
presence. This was no mere charge on a trench, it was en- 
listing for a war ! But even in that moment of fervour, 
Hal would have been frightened had he realised the pe- 
riod of that enlistment, the years of weary and desperate 
conflict to which he was pledging his life. 



Hal descended from his rostrum, and the crowds 



 

made way for him, and with his brother at his side he went 
down the street to the office building, upon the porch of 
which the guards were standing. His progress was a tri- 
umphal one ; rough voices shouted words of encouragement 
in his ears, men jostled and fought to shake his hand or to 
pat him on the back ; they even patted Edward and tried to 
shake his hand, because he was with Hal, and seemed to 
have his confidence. Afterwards Hal thought it over and 
was merry. Such an adventure for Edward ! 

The younger man went up the steps of the building and 
spoke to the guards. " I want to see Mr. Cartwright." 

" He's inside," answered one, not cordially. With Ed- 
ward following, Hal entered, and was ushered into the pri- 
vate office of the superintendent. 

Having been a working-man, and class-conscious, Hal 
was observant of the manners of mine-superintendents; 
he noted that Cartwright bowed politely to Edward, but 
did not include Edward's brother. "Mr. Cartwright," 
he said, " I have come to you as a deputation from the 
workers of this camp." 

The superintendent did not appear impressed by the 
announcement. 

" I am instructed to say that the men demand the re- 
dress of four grievances before they return to work. 
First — " 

Here Cartwright spoke, in his quick, sharp way. 
" There's no use going on, sir. This company will deal 
only with its men as individuals. It will recognise no 
deputations." 

Hal's answer was equally quick. "Very well, Mr. 
Cartwright. In that case, I come to you as an individual." 

For a moment the superintendent seemed nonplussed. 

" I wish to ask four rights which are granted to me by 
the laws of this state. First, the right to belong to a 
union, without being discharged for it." 

The other had recovered his manner of quiet mastery. 



 

"You have that right, sir ; you have always had it. You 
know perfectly well that the company has never discharged 
any one for belonging to a union," 

The man was looking at Hal, and there was a duel of 
the eyes between them. A cold anger moved Hal. His 
ability to endure this sort of thing was at an end. " Mr. 
Cartwright," he said, " you are the servant of one of the 
world's greatest actors; and you support him ably." 

The other flushed and drew back; Edward put in 
quickly: "Hal, there's nothing to be gained by such 
talk ! " 

" He has all the world for an audience," persisted Hal. 
" He plays the most stupendous farce — and he and all 
his actors wearing such solemn faces ! " 

" Mr. Cartwright," said Edward, with dignity, " I trust 
you understand that I have done everything I can to re- 
strain my brother." 

" Of course, Mr. Warner," replied the superintendent. 
"And you must know that I, for my part, have done 
everything to show your brother consideration." 

" Again ! " exclaimed Hal. " This actor is a gen- 
ius!" 

" Hal, if you have business with Mr. Cartwright — " 

" He showed me consideration by sending his gunmen 
to seize me at night, drag me out of a cabin, and nearly 
twist the arm off me ! Such humour never was ! " 

Cartwright attempted to speak — but looking at Ed- 
ward, not at Hal. " At that time — " 

" He showed me consideration by having me locked up 
in jail and fed on bread and water for two nights and a 
day ! Can you beat that humour ? " 

" At that time I did not know — " 

" By forging my name to a letter and having it circu- 
lated in the camp ! Finally — most considerate of all — 
by telling a newspaper man that I had seduced a girl 
here ! " 



 

The superintendent flushed still redder. " No ! " he de- 

ClflTGQ 

" What? " cried Hal. " You didn't tell Billy Keating 
of the Gazette that I had seduced a girl in North Valley ? 
You didn't describe the girl to him — a red-haired Irish 
girl ? " 

u I merely said, Mr. Warner, that I had heard certain 



rumours — " 



Certain rumours, Mr. Cartwright? The certainty 
was all of your making ! " You made a definite and explicit 
statement to Mr. Keating — " 

" I did not ! " declared the other. 

" I'll soon prove it ! " And Hal started towards the 
telephone on Cartwright's desk. 

" What are you going to do, Hal ? " 

" I am going to get Billy Keating on the wire, and let 
you hear his statement." 

" Oh, rot, Hal ! " cried Edward. " I don't care any- 
thing about Keating's statement. You know that at that 
time Mr. Cartwright had no means of knowing who you 



were." 



Cartwright was quick to grasp this support. " Of 
course not, Mr. Warner! Your brother came here, pre- 
tending to be a working boy — " 

"Oh!" cried Hal. "So that's it! You think it 
proper to circulate slanders about working boys in your
