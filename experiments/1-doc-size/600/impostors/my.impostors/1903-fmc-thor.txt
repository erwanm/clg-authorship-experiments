Messaggero, saying nothing about the carpenter. The 
only lie he needed to invent was to the effect that he 
had been standing near the door of the palace when 
Sabina had come out. The porter, being relieved from 
the order to keep the postern shut against everybody 
had been quite willing to gossip with Toto about the 
detective's visit, the closed room and Malipieri's re- 
fusal to let any one enter it. As for what had hap- 
pened in the vaults, Toto could reconstruct the exact 
truth much more accurately than Gigi could have 
done, even with his help. It was a thrilling story ; 
the newspaper paid him well for it and printed it with 
reservations. 

There was not a suggestion of offence to Sabina, 
such as might have afforded ground for an action 
against the paper, or against those that copied the 
story from it. The writer was careful to extol 'Mali- 
pieri's heroic courage and strength, and to point out 







that Sabina had been half -dead of fatigue and cold, as 
Toto knew must have been the case. It was all a justi- 
fication, and not in the least an accusation. But the 
plain, bald fact was proved, that Donna Sabina Conti 
had spent the night in the rooms of the now famous 
Signor Malipieri, no one else being in the apartment 
during the whole time. He had saved her life like a 
hero, and had acted like a Bayard in all he had done 
. for the unfortunate young lady. It was an adventure 
worthy of the middle ages. It was magnificent. Her 
family, informed at once by Malipieri, had come to get 
her on the following morning. Toto had told the peo- 
ple at the office of the Messaggero, who it was that had 
represented the " family," but the little newspaper was 
far too worldly-wise to mention Volterra in such a con- 
nection. Donna Sabina, the article concluded, was now 
with her mother at the Russian Embassy. 

The evening pd,pers simply enlarged upon this first 
story, and in the same strain. Malipieri was held up 
to the admiration of the public. Sabina's name was 
treated with profound respect, there was not a word 
which could be denied with truth, or resented with a 
show of justice. And yet, in Italy, and most of all in 
Rome, it meant ruin to Sabina, and the reprobation of 
all decent people upon Malipieri if he did not immedi- 
ately marry her. 

It was the ambassador himself who informed the 
Princess of what had happened, coming himself to the 
sitting-room as soon as he learned that she was visible. 
He stayed with her a long time, and they sent for 



 

Sabina, who was by far the least disturbed of the three. 
It was all true, she said, and there was nothing against 
her in the article. 

Masin brought the news to Malipieri with his coffee, 
and the paper itself. Malipieri scarcely ever read it, 
but Masin never failed to, and his big, healthy face was 
very grave. 

Malipieri felt as if he were going to have brain 
fever, as his eye ran along the lines. 

"Masin," he said, when he had finished, "did you 
ever kill a man ? " 

" No, sir," answered Masin. " You have always be- 
lieved that I was innocent, though I had to serve my 
seven years." 

" I did not mean that," said Malipieri. 

Then he sat a long time with his untasted coffee at 
his elbow and the crumpled little sheet in his hand. 

" Of course, sir," Masin said at last, " I owe you 
everything, and if you ordered me — " 

He paused significantly, but his master did not 
understand. 

" What ? " he asked, starting nervously. 

" Well, sir, if it were necessary for your safety, that 
somebody should be killed, I would risk the galleys for 
life, sir. What am I, without you ? " 

Malipieri laughed a little wildly, and dropped the 
paper. 

" No, my friend," he said presently, " we would risk 
our lives for each other, but we are not murderers. 
Besides, there is nobody to be killed, unless you will 





have the goodness to put a bullet through my 
head." 

And he laughed again, in a way that frightened the 
quiet man beside him. What drove him almost mad 
was that he was powerless. He longed to lay his 
hands on the editor of the paper, yet there was not 
a word, not a suggestion, not an implied allusion for 
which any man in his senses could have demanded an 
apology. It was the plain truth, and nothing else ; 
except that it was adorned by fragmentary panegyrics 
of himself, which made it even more exasperating if 
that were possible. He had not only wrecked Sabina's 
reputation by his quixotic folly ; he was to be praised 
to the skies for doing it. 

His feverish anger turned into a dull pain that was 
much worse. The situation looked utterly hopeless. 
Masin stood still beside him watching him with pro- 
found concern, and presently took the cup of coffee 
and held it to his lips. He drank a little, like a sick 
man, only half consciously, and drew back, and shook 
his head. Masin did not know what to do and waited 
in mute distress, as a big dog, knowing that his master 
is in trouble, looks up into his face and feebly wags his 
sympathetic tail, just a little, at long intervals, and 
then keeps quite still. 

Malipieri gradually recovered his senses enough to 
think connectedly, and he tried to remember whether 
he had ever heard of a situation like his own. As 
he was neither a novelist nor a critic, he failed, and 
frankly asked himself whether suicide might not be 



 

a way out of the difficulty for Sabina. He was not 
an unbeliever, and he had always abhorred and de- 
spised the idea of suicide, as most thoroughly healthy 
men do when it occurs to them ; but if at that time he 
could have persuaded himself that his death could 
undo the harm he had brought upon Sabina he would 
not have hesitated a moment. Neither his body nor 
his soul could matter much in comparison with her 
good name. Hell was full of people who had got 
there because they had done bad things for their own 
advantage ; if he went there, it would at least not be 
for that. He did not think of hell at all, just then, 
nor of heaven or of anything else that was very far 
off. He only thought of Sabina, and if he once wished 
himself dead for his own sake, he drove the cowardly 
thought away. As long as he was alive, he could still 
do something for her — surely, there must be some- 
thing that he could do. There must be a way out, 
if he could only use his wits and his strength, as he 
had made a way out of the vaults, for her to pass 
through, ten days ago. 

There was nothing, or at least he could think of 
nothing, that could help her. To try and free him- 
self from the bond he had put upon himself would be 
to break a solemn promise given to a dying man whom 
he had dearly loved. The woman he had seen that 
once, to marry her and leave her, had been worthy 
of the sacrifice, too, as far as lay in her. He had 
given her a small income, enough for her and her 
little girl to live on comfortably. She had not only 





kept within it, but had learned to support herself, 
little by little, till she had refused to take the money 
that was sent to her. At regular times, she wrote to 
him, as to a benefactor, touching and truthful letters, 
with news of the growing child. He knew that it was 
all without affectation of any sort, and that she had 
turned out a thoroughly good and honest woman. 
The little girl knew that her father was dead, and that 
her own name was really and legally Malipieri, beyond 
a doubt. Her mother kept the copy of her certificate 
of birth together with the certificate of marriage. The 
Signora Malipieri lived as a widow in Florence and 
gave lessons in music and Italian. She had never 
asked, but one thing of Malipieri, which was that he 
would never try to see her, nor let her daughter 
know that he was alive. It was easy to promise that. 
He knew that she had been most faithful to her lover's 
memory, cherishing the conviction that in the justice 
of heaven he was her true husband, as he would have 
been indeed had he lived but a few months longer. 
She was bringing up her child to be like herself, save 
for her one fault. Malipieri had settled a sufficient 
dowry on the girl, lest anything should happen to him 
before she was old enough to marry. 

The mere suggestion of divorcing a woman who had 
acted as she had done since his friend's death, was 
horrible to him. It was like receiving a blow in the 
face, it was mud upon his honour, it was an insult to 
his conscience, it was far worse than merely taking 
back a gift once given in a generous impulse. If he 



 

had felt himself capable of such baseness he could 
never again have looked honest men fairly in the eyes. 
It would mean that he must turn upon her, to insult 
her by accusing her of sonaething she had never done; 
he knew nothing of the divorce laws in foreign coun- 
tries,, except that Italians could obtain divorce by a 
short residence and could then come back and marry 
again under Italian law. That was all he knew. The 
Princess had not asked of him a legal impossibility, 
but he had felt, when she spoke,, that it would be 
easier to explain the dogma of papal infallibility to a 
Chinese pirate than to make her understand how he 
felt towards the good woman who had a right to live 
xuader his name and had borne it so honourably for 
many years. 

Sabina would understand. He wished now, with all 
his heart, that in the hours they had spent together he 
had told her the secret which he had been obliged to 
confide to her mother. He wondered whether she 
knew it, and hoped that she did. She would at least 
understand his silence now, she would know why he 
was not at the Embassy that, morning as soon as he 
could be received by her mother. She might not for- 
give hiim, because she knew that he loved her, but she 
would see why he could not divorce in order to marry 
her. 

An hour passed, and two hours, and still he sat in 
his chair, while Masin came and went softly, as if his 
master were ill. Then reporters sent up cards, with 
urgently polite requests to be received, and he had to 



§

give orders that lie was not to be disturbed on any 
account. He would see no one, he would answer no 
questions, until he had made up his mind what to do. 

At last he rose, shook himself, walked twice up and 
down the room and then spoke to Masin. 

" I am going out," he said. " I shall be back in an 
hour." 

He had seen that there was at least one thing 
which he must do at once, and after stopping short, 
stunned to stupor by what had happened, his life began 
to move on again. It was manifestly his duty to see 
the Princess again, and he knew that she would receive 
him, for she would think that he had changed his mind 
after all, and meant to free himself. He must see her 
and say something, he knew not what, to convince her 
that he was acting honourably. 

He was shown to her sitting-room, as if he were ex- 
pected. It was not long since the ambassador had left 
her and her daughter had gone back to her room, and 
she was in a humour in which he had not seen her 
before, as he guessed when he saw her face. Her 
wonderful complexion was paler than usual, her brows 
were drawn together, her eyes were angry, there was 
nothing languid or careless in her attitude, and she held 
her head high. 

" I expected you," she said. " I sent word that you 
were to come up at once." 

She did not even put out her hand, but there was a 
chair opposite her and she nodded towards it. He sat 
down, feeling that a struggle was before him. 



 

" The ambassador has just been here," she said. " He 
brought the newspaper with him, and I have read the 
article. I suppose you have seen it." 

Malipieri bent his head, but kept his eyes upon her. 

" I have told the ambassador that Sabina is engaged 
to marry you," she said calmly. 

Malipieri started and sat upright in his chair. If he 
had known her better, he might have guessed that what 
she said was untrue, as yet; but she had made the 
statement with magnificent assurance. 

" Your engagement will be announced in the papers 
this evening," she continued. " Shall you deny it?" 

She looked at him steadily, and he returned her gaze, 
but for a long time he could not answer. She had him 
at a terrible advantage. 

" I shall not deny it publicly," he said at last. " That 
would be an injury to your daughter." 

" Shall you deny it at all ? " She was conscious of her 
strong position, and meant to hold it. 

" I shall write to the lady who is living under my name, 
and I shall tell her the circumstances, and that I am 
obliged to allow the announcement to be made by you." 

"Give me your word that you will not deny your 
engagement to any one else. You know that I have a 
right to require that. My daughter knows that you 
are married." 

Malipieri hesitated only a moment. 

" I give you my word," he said. 

She rose at once and went towards one of the doors, 
without looking at him. He wondered whether she 





ifleant to dismiss him rudely, and stood looking after 
her. She stopped a moment, with her hand on the 
knob of the lock, and glanced back. 

" I will call Sabina," she said, and she was gome. 

He stood stiE and waited, and two or three minutes 
passed before Sabina entered. She glanced at him, 
smiled rather gravely, and looked round the room as 
she came forward, as if expecting to see some, one 
else. 

" Where is my mother ? " she asked, holding out her 
hand. 

"She said she was going to call you," Malipieri 
answered. 

" So she did, and she told me she was coming back to 
you, because I was not quite ready." 

" She did not come back." 

" She means us to be alone," Sabina said, and sud- 
denly she took both his hands and prised them a 
little, shaking them up and down, almost childishly. 
" I am so glad ! " she cried. " I was longing to see 
you!" 

Even then, Mallpieri could not help smiling, and for 
a moment he forgot all his troubles. When they sat 
down, side by side, upon a little sofa, the Princess was 
already telling the ambassador that Maiipieri had come 
and that they were engaged to be married. She had 
carried the situation by a master stroke. 

" She has told you all about me," Maiipieri said, turn- 
ing his face to Sabina. " You know what my life is. 
Has she told you everything ? " 



 

" Yes," Sabina answered softly, but not meeting his 
look, " everything. But I want to hear it from you. 
Will you tell me ? Will it hurt you to tell me about 
what you did for your friend ? You know my mother 
is not always very accurate in telling a story. I shall 
understand why you did it." 

He had known that she would, and he told her the 
• story, a little less baldly than he had told her mother, 
yet leaving out such details as she need not hear. He 
hesitated a little, once or twice. 

" I understand," she repeated, watching him with 
innocent eyes. " She felt just as if they were really 
married, and he could not bear to die, feeling that she 
would be without protection, and that other men would 
all want to marry her, because she was beautiful. And 
her father and mother were angry because she loved him 
so much." 

"Yes," Malipieri answered, smiling, "that was it. 
They loved each other dearly." 

" It was splendid of you," she said, "I never dreamt 
that any man would do such a thing." 

" It cannot be undone." He was at least free to say 
that much, sadly. 

There was a pause, and they looked away from each 
other. At last Sabina laid her hand lightly upon his 
for a moment, though she did not turn her face to 
him. 

" I should not like you so much, if you wished to 
undo it," she said. 

"Thank you," he answered, withdrawing the hand 



she released when she had finished speaking, and folding 
it upon his other. " I should love you less, if you did 
not understand me so well." 

" It is more than understanding. It is much 
more." 

He remembered how he had taken her slender body 
in his arms to warm her when she had been almost dead 
of the cold and dampness, and a mad impulse was in him 
to press her to him now, as he had done then, and to 
feel her small fair head lay itself upon his shoulder 
peacefully, as it surely would. He sat upright and 
pressed one hand upon the other rather harder than 
before. 

" You believe it, do you not ? " she asked. " Why is 
your face so hard ? " 

" Because I am bound hand and foot, like a man who 
is carried to execution." 

" But we can always love each other just the same," 
Sabina said, and her voice was warm and soft. 

" Yes, always, and that will not make it easier to 
live without you," he answered rather harshly. 

" You need not," she said, after an instant's pause. 

He turned suddenly, startled, not understanding, 
wondering what she could mean. She met his eyes 
quite quietly, and he saw how deep and steady hers 
were, and the light in them. 

" You need not live without me unless you please," 
she said. 

" But I must, since I cannot marry you, and you 
understand that I could not be divorced — " 



 

" My mother has just told me that no decent man 
will marry me, because all the world knows that I 
stayed at the palace that night. She must be right, 
for she could have no object in saying it if it were not 
true, could she ? Then what does it matter how any 
one talks about me now ? I will go with you. We 
cannot marry, but we shall always be together." 

Malipieri's face expressed his amazement. 

" But it is impossible ! " he cried. " You cannot do 
that ! You do not know what you are saying ! " 

" Oh, yes, I do ! That poor, kind old Sassi has left 
me all he had, and I can go where I please. I will go 
with you. 'ou rather have me shut up in a 
convent to die ? That is what my mother will try to 
do with me, and she will tell people that I was ' mad, 
poor girl ' ! Do you think I do not know her ? She 
wants this little sum of money that I am to have, too, 
as if she and the others had not spent all I should have 
had. Do you think I am bound to obey my mother, 
if she takes me to the convent door, and tells me that I 
am to stay there for the rest of my life ? " 

The gentle voice was clear and strong and indignant 
now. Malipieri twisted his fingers one upon another, 
and sat with his head bent low. He knew that she 
had no clear idea of what she was saying when she 
proposed to join her existence with his. Her maiden 
thoughts could find no harm in it. 

" You do not know what your mother said to me, 
before you came in," he answered. " She told me that 
she would announce our engagement at once, and 





made me give my word that I would not deny it to 
any one but my legal wife." 

" You gave your word ? " Sabina asked quickly, not 
at all displeased. 

"What could I do?" 

" Nothing else ! I am glad yon did, for we can see 
each other as much as we like now. But how shall 
we manage it in the end, since we cannot marry ? " 

" Break the imaginary engagement, I suppose," Malipieri answered gloomily. "I see nothing else to be 
done." 

" But then my mother says that no decent man will 
marry me. It will be just the same, all over again. It 
was very clever of her ; she is trying to force you to do 
what she wants. In the meantime you can come and 
see me every day — that is the best part of it. Besides, 
she will leave us alone together here, for hours, because 
she thinks that the more you fall in love with me the 
more you will wish to get a divorce. Oh, she is a very 
clever woman ! You do not know her as I do ! " 

Malipieri marvelled at the amazing combination of 
girlish innocence and keen insight into her mother's 
worldly and cynical character, which Sabina had shown 
during the last few minutes. There never yet was a 
man in love with girl or woman who did not find in 
her something he had never dreamt of before. 

" She is clever," he assented gravely, " but she can- 
not make me break that promise, even for your sake. 
I cannot help looking forward and thinking what the 
end must be." 



 

" It is mucli better to enjoy the present," Sabina an- 
swered. " We can be together every day. You will 
write to your — no, she is not your wife, and I will not 
call her so ! She would, not be really your wife if she 
could, for she made you promise never to go and see 
her. That was nice of her, for of oourae she knew that 
if she saw you often, she must end by falling in love 
with you. Any woman would ; you know it perfectly 
well. You need not shake your head at me, like that. 
You will write to her, and explain, and she vdll under- 
stand, and then we will let things go on as long as 
they can till something else happens." 

" What can possibly happen ? " 

"Something always happens. Things never go on 
very long without a change, do they ? I am sure, 
everything in my life has changed half a dozen times 
in the last fortnight." 

" In mine, too," Malipieri answered. 

"And if things get worse, and if worse comes to 
worst," Sabina answered, "I have told you what I 
mean to do. I shall come to you, wherever you are, 
and you will have to let me stay, no matter what 
people choose to say. That is, if you still care for me ! " 

She laughed softly and happily, and not in the least 
recklessly, though she was talking of throwing the, 
world and all connection with it to the winds. The 
immediate future looked bright to her, since they were 
to meet every day, and after that, " something " would 
happen. If nothing did, and they had to face trouble 
again, they would meet it bravely. That was all any 





one could do in life. She had found happiness too 
suddenly after an unhappy childhood, to dream of 
letting it go, cost what it might to keep it.
