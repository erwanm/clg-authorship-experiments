By and by Carson City was pointed out to us. It nestled 
in the edge of a great plain and was a sui£cient number of 

miles away to look like an assemblage 
of mere white spots in the shadow of 
a gi'im range of mountains overlook- 
ing it, whose summits seemed lifted 
clear out of companionship and con- 
sciousness of earthly things. 

We arrived, disembarked, and the 
stage went on. It was a "'wooden" 
town ; its population two thousand souls. The main street consisted of 
four or five blocks of little white frame stores which were too 
high to sit down on, but not too high for various other purposes ; 
in fact, hardly high enough. They were packed close together, 
side by side, as if room were scarce in that mighty plain. The 
sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and 
inclined to rattle when walked upon. In the middle of the 
town, opposite the stores, was the " plaza " which is native to 
all towns beyond the Rocky Mountains — a large, unfenced, 
level vacancy, with a liberty pole in it, and very useful as a 
place for public auctions, horse trades, and mass meetings, and 
likewise for teamsters to camp in. Two other sides of the 
plaza were faced by stores, offices and stables. The rest of 
Carson City was pretty scattering. 

We were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office 
and on the way up to the Governor's from the hotel — among 
others, to a Mr. Harris, who was on horseback ; li,e began to 
say something, but interrupted himself with the remark : 

" I'll have to get you to excuse me a minute ; yonder is the 
witness that swore I helped to rob the California coach — a 
piece of impertinent intermeddling, sir, for I am not even 
acquainted with the man." 

Then he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with 
a six-shooter, and the stranger began to explain with another. 



When the pistols were emptied, the stranger resumed his work 
(mending a whip-lash), and Mr. Harris rode by with a polite 
nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through one of his lungs,, 
and several in his hips ; and from them issued little rivulets- 
of blood that coursed down the horse's sides and made the 
animal look quite picturesque. I never saw Harris shoot a. 
man after that but it recalled to mind that first day in Carson. 
This was all we saw that day, for it was two o'clock, now 
and according to custom the daily "Washoe Zephyr" set in; 
a soaring dust-drift about the size of the United States set up 
edgewise came with it, and the capital of Nevada Territory 

disappeared from view. Still, there were sights to be seen 
which were not wholly uninteresting to new comers ; for the 
vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things strange to the 
upper air — things living and dead, that flitted hither and 
thither, going and coming, appearing and disappearing among 
the rolling billows of dust — liats, chickens and parasols sailing 
in the remote heavens ; blankets, tin signs, sage-brush and 
shingles a shade lower; door-mats and butt'alo robes lower 
«till ; shovels and coal scuttles on the next grade ; glass doors, 
*cats and little children on the next; disrupted lumber yards, 
iight buggies and wheelbarrows on the next; and down only 
Ihirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of 
emigrating roofs and vacant lots. 

It was something to see that much. I could have seen 
snore, if I could have kept the dust out of my eyes. 

But seriously a AVashoe wind is by no means a trifling 
anatter. It blows flimsy houses down, lifts shingle roofs oc- 
casionally, rolls up tin ones like sheet music, now and then 
Pjlows a stage coach over and spills the passengers ; and tra- 
dition says the reason there are so many bald people there, is, 
that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are 
looking skyward after their hats. Carson streets seldom look 
inactive on Summer afternoons, because there are so many 
<?itizens skipping around their escaping hats, like chamber- 
maids trying to head off a spider. 

The "Washoe Zephyr" (Washoe is a pet nickname for 
Nevada) is a peculiarly Scriptural wind, in that no man 
knoweth "whence it cometh." That is to say, where it origi- 
nates. It comes right over the mountains from the West, but 
when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the 
'Other side ! It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top 
for the occasion, and starts from there. It is a pretty regular 
wind, in the summer time. Its office hours are from two in 
the afternoon till two the next morning ; and anybody ventur- 
ing abroad during those twelve hours needs to allow for the 
wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward of the 
point he is aiming at. And yet the first complaint a Washoe 
visitor to San Francisco makes, is that the sea winds blow so, 
there ! There is a good deal of human nature in that. 

We found the state palace of the Governor of Nevada 
Territory to consist of a white frame one-story house with two 
small rooms in it and a stanchion supported shed in front — for 

grandeur — it compelled the respect of the citizen and inspired 
the Indians with awe. The newly arrived Chief and Associate 
Justices of the Territory, and other machinery of the govern- 
ment, were domiciled with less splendor. They were boarding 
around privately, and had their offices in their bedrooms. 

The Secretary and I took quarters in the " ranch " of a 
worthy French lady by the name of Bridget OTlannigan, a 
camp follower of his Excellency the Governor. She had 
known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief of the 
Metropolitan Police of New York, and she would not desert 

him in his adversity as Governor of Nevada. Our room was 
on the lower floor, facing the plaza, and when we had got our 
bed, a small table, two chairs, the government fire-proof safe, 
and the Unabridged Dictionary into it, there was still room 
enough left for a visitor — may be two, but not without strain- 
ing the walls. But the walls could stand it — at least the par- 
titions could, for they consisted simply of one thickness of 
white " cotton domestic " stretched from corner to corner of 
the room. This was the rule in Carson — any other kind of 
partition was the rare exception. And if you stood in a dark 
lit room and your neighbors in the next had lights, the shadows 
on your canvas told queer secrets sometimes ! Very often 

— _ these partitions 

were made of old 
flour sacks basted 
together ; and ihen 
the difference between the common-herd and the aristocracy was, that the 
common herd had 
unornamented sacks, while the walls of the aristocrat were over- 
powering with rudimental fresco — 
i. e., red and blue 
mill brands on the 
flour sacks. Occasionally, also, the better classes embellished 
their canvas by pasting pictures from IIarpers Weekly on them. 
In many cases, too, the wealthy and the cultured rose to spit- 
toons and other evidences of a sumptuous and luxurious taste.* 
We had a carpet and a genuine queen' s-ware washbowl. Con- 
sequently we were hated without reserve by the other tenants 
of the O'Flannigan " ranch." When we added a painted oil- 
cloth window cm-tain, we simply took our lives into our own 
hands. To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs and took 
up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen 
white pine cot-bedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the 
one sole room of which the second story consisted. 

It was a jolly company, the fourteen. They were principally
voluntary camp-followers of the Governor, who had 
joined his retinue by their own election at New York and 

San Francisco and came along, feeling that in the scuffle for 
little territorial crumbs and offices they  could not make their 
condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably 
expect to make it better. They were popularly known as the 
" Irish Brigade," though there were only four or five Irish- 
men among all the Governor's retainers. His good-natured 


 Washoe people take a joke so hard that I must explain that the above 
description was only the rule ; there were many honorable exceptions in 
Carson — plastered ceilings and houses that had considerable furniture in
them. 

Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen 
created — especially when there arose a rumor that they were 
paid assassins of his, brought along to quietly reduce the 
democratic vote when desirable ! 

Mrs. O'Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten 
dollars a week apiece, and they were cheerfully giving their 
notes for it. They were perfectly satisfied, but Bridget pres- 
ently found that notes that eould not be discounted were but 
a feeble constitution for a Carson boarding-house. So she 
began to harry the Governor to find employment for the 
" Brigade." Her importunities and theirs together drove him 
to a gentle desperation at last, and he finally summoned the 
Brigade to the presence. Then, said he : 

" Gentlemen, I have planned a Incrative and useful service 
for you — a service which will provide you with recreation amid 
noble landscapes, and ailbrd you never ceasing opportunities 
for enriching your minds by observation and stndy. I want 
you to survey a railroad from Carson City westward to a cer- 
tain point ! "When the legislature meets I will have the neces- 
sary bill passed and the remuneration arranged.'' 

"What, a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains?" 
" Well, then, survey it eastward to a certain point ! " 
He converted them into surveyors, chain-bearers and so 
on, and turned them loose in the desert. It was "-recreation "' 
with a vengeance ! Recreation on foot, Ingging chains through 
sand and sage-brush, under a sultry sun and among cattle bones, 
cayotes and tarantulas. " Romantic 
adventure " could go no ftirther. They 
surveyed very slowly, very deliberately, 
very carefully. They returned every 
night during the first week, dusty, 
footsore, tired, and hungry, but very 
jolly. They brought in great store 
of prodigious hairy spiders— tarantulas — and imprisoned them in covei'ed 
RECREATioN. tumblers up stairs in the "ranch.'" 

After the first week, they had to camp on the field, for they 
were getting well eastward. They made a good mny iri- 
quiries as to the location of that indefinite " certain point," but 
got no information. At last, to a peculiarly urgent inquiry 
of " How far eastward ? " Governor Nye telegraphed back : 

" To the Atlantic Ocean, blast you ! — and then bridge it 
and go on ! " 

This brought back the dusty toilers, who sent in a report 
and ceased from their labors. The Governor was always com- 
fortable about it ; he said Mrs. O'Flannigan would hold him 
for the Brigade's board anyhow, and he intended to get what 
entertainment he could out of the boys ; he said, with his old- 
time pleasant twinkle, that he meant to survey them into Utah 
and then telegraph Brigham to hang them for trespass ! 

The surveyors brought back more tarantulas with tliem, 
and so we had quite a menagerie arranged along the shelves 
of the room. Some of these spiders could straddle over a* 
common saucer with their hairy, muscular legs, and when 
their feelings were hurt, or their dignity olfended, they were 
the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can fur- 
nish. If their glass pris- 
on-houses were touched 
ever so lightly they were np and spoiling 
for a light in a minute. 
Starchy ? — proud ? Indeed, they would take 
up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress. 
There was as usual a furious " zephyr " blowing the hrst 
night of the brigade's return, and about midnight the roof 
of an adjoining stable blew off, and a corner of it came crasli- 
ino; throuojh the side of our ranch. There Mas a simultane- 
oils avrakening, and a tumultuous muster of the brigade in 
the dark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each 
other in the narrow aisle between the bed-rows. In the 

midst of the turmoil. Bob II sprung up out of a sound 

sleep, and knocked down a shelf with his head. Instantly he 
shouted : 

" Turn out, boys — the tarantulas is loose ! " 
Ko warning ever sounded so dreadful. Nobody tried, any 
loQger, to leave the room, lest he might step on a tarantula. 
E't'ery man groped for a trunk or a bed, and jumped on it. 
Then followed the strangest silence — a silence of grisly sus- 
pense it was, too — waiting, expectancy, fear. It was as dark 
as pitch, and one had to imagine the spectacle of those four- 
teen scant-clad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds, for 
not a thing could be seen. Then came occasional little inter- 
ruptions of the silence, and one could recognize a man and 
tell his locality by his voice, or locate any other sound a suf- 
ferer made by his gropings or changes of position. The occa- 
sional voices were not given to much speaking — you simply 
heard a gentle ejaculation of " Ow ! " followed by a solid 
thump, and you knew the gentleman had felt a haiiy blanket 
, or something touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed 
to the floor. Another silence. Presently you would hear a 
gasping A'oice say : 

" Su-su-something's crawling up the back of my neck ! " 

Every now and then you could hear a little subdued scram- 
ble and a sorrowful " O Lord ! " and then you knew that some- 
body was getting away from something he took for a taran- 
tula, and not losing any time about it, either. Directly a voice 
in the corner rang out wild and clear : 

" I've got him ! I've got him ! " [Pause, and probable 
change of circumstances.] " No, he's got me ! Oh, ain't they 
never going to fetch a lantern ! " 

The lantern came at that moment, in the hands of Mrs. 
O'Flannigan, whose anxiety to know the amount of damage 
done by the assaulting roof had not prevented her waiting a 
judicious interval, after getting out of bed and lighting up, to 
see if the wind was done, noM', up stairs, or had a larirer contract. 

The hmdscape presented when the lantern flashed into the 
room was picturesque, and might have been funny to some 
people, but was not to us. Although we were perched so 
strangely upon boxes, trunks and beds, and so strangely at- 
tired, too, we were too earnestly distressed and too genuinely 
miserable to see any fun about it, and there vvas not the sem- 
blance of a smile anywhere visible. I know I am not capa- 
ble of suffering more than I did during those few minutes of 
suspense in the dark, surrounded by those creeping, bloody- 
minded tarantulas. I had skipped from bed to bed and from 
hex to box in a cold agony, and every time I touched anything 
that was furzy I fancied I felt the fangs. I had rather go to 
war than live that episode over again. Xobody was hurt. The 
man who thought a tarantula had " got him " was mistaken — 
onlv a crack in a box had cauffht his fincer. Not one of those 
escaped tarantulas was ever seen again. There were ten or 
twelve of them. We took candles and hunted the place high 
and low for them, but with no success. Did we go hack to 
bed then ? "We did nothino; of the kind, Monev could not 
have persuaded us to do it. We sat up the rest of the night 
playing cribbage and keeping a sharp lookout for the enemy. 



CHAPTER XXIT. 

IT was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and 
the weather superb. In two or three weeks I had grown 
wonderfully fascinated with the curious new country, and 
concluded to put off my return to " the States " awhile. I 
had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch Ixit, 
blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and 
gloried in the absence of coat, vest and braces. I felt rowdy- 
ish and "bully," (as the historian Josephus phrases it, in his 
fine chapter upon the destruction of the Temple). It seemed 
to me that nothing could be so fine and so romantic. I had 
become an officer of the government, but that was for mere 
sublimity. The office was an unique sinecure. I had nothing 
to do and no salary. I was private Secretary to his majesty 
the Secretary and there was not yet writing enough for two 
of us. So Johnny K and I devoted our time to amuse- 
ment. He was the young son of an Ohio nabob and was out 
there for recreation. He got it. We had heard a world of 
talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally 
curiosity drove us thither to see it. Three or four members 
of the Brigade had been there and located some timber lands 
on its shores and stored up a quantity of provisions in their 
camp. We strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders 
and took an axe apiece and started — for we intended to take 
up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy. We 
were on foot. The reader will find it advantageous to go 
horseback. We were told that the distance was eleven miles. 


We tramped a long time on level ground, cand then toiled 
laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles high and 
looked over. !No lake there. We descended on the other 
side, crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three 
or four thousand miles high, apparently, and looked over again. 
No lake yet. We sat down tired and perspiring, and hired a 
couple of Chinamen to curse those people who had beguiled 
us. Thus refreshed, we presently resumed the march with 
renewed vigor and determination. We plodded on, two or 
three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us — a 
noble sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred 
feet above the level of the sea, and walled in by a rim of snow- 
clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet 
higher still ! It was a vast oval, and one would have to use 
up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around it. As 
it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly 
photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely 
be the fairest picture the whole earth affords. 

We found the small skift' belonging to the Brigade boySy 
and without loss of time 
set out across a deep bend 
of the lake toward the land- 
marks that signified the locality of the camp. I got 
Johnny to row — not because I mind exertion myself, 
but because it makes me sick to ride backwards 
when I am at work. But 
I steered. A three-mile pull brought us to 
the camp just as the night fell, and we p 
stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly hun- 
gry. In a "cache" among the rocks we found 
the provisions and the cooking utensils, and then, all fatigued 
as I was, I sat down on a boulder and superintended while 
Johnny gathered wood and cooked supper. Many a man who 
had gone through what I had, would have wanted to rest. 


It was a delicious supper — hot bread, fried bacon, and 
black coifee. It was a delicious solitude we were in, too. 
Three miles away was a saw-mill and some workmen, but 
there were not lifteen other human beings throughout the 
wide circumference of the lake. As the darkness closed down 
and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with 
jewels, we smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot 
our troubles and our pains. In due time we spread our 
blankets in the warm sand between two large boulders and 
soon feel asleep, careless of the procession of ants that passed 
dn through rents in our clothing and explored our persons. 
Nothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us, for it had 
been fairly earned, and if our consciences had any sins on 
them they had to adjourn court for that night, any way. The 
wind rose just "as we were losing consciousness, and we were 
lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf upon the shore. 

It is always very cold on that lake shore in the night, but 
we had plenty of blankets and were warm enough. We never 
moved a muscle all night, but waked at 
early dawn in the original positions, and 
got up at once, thoroughly refreshed, 
free from soreness, and brim full of 
friskiness. There is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience. 
That morning we could have whipped 
ten such people as we were the day 
before — sick ones at any rate. But the 
world is slow, and people will go to 
" water cures " and " movement cures " 
and to foreign lands for health. Three 
months of camp life on Lake Tahoe 
would restore an Egyptian mummy to 
his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator. 
I do not mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the 
fresher ones. The air up there in the clouds is very pure and 
line, bracing and delicious. And why shouldn't it be? — it is 
the same the angels breathe. I think that hardly any amount 

of fatigue can be gathered together that a man cannot sleep off 
in one night on the sand by its side. Not under a roof, but 
under the sky ; it seldom or never rains there in the summer 
time. I know a man who went there to die. But he made a 
failure of it. He was a skeleton when he came, and could 
barely stand. He had no appetite, and did nothing but read 
tracts and reflect on the future. Three months later he was 
sleeping out of doors regularly, eating all he could hold, three 
times a day, and chasing game over mountains three thousand 
feet high for recreation. And he was a skeleton no longer, 
but weighed part of a ton. This is no fancy sketch, but the 
truth. His disease was consumption. I confidently commend 
his experience to other skeletons. 

I superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten break- 
fast we got in the boat and 
skirted along the lake shore 
about three miles and disem- 
barked. We liked the appearance of the place, and so we 
claimed some three hundred 
acres of it and stuck our " notices " on a tree. It was yellow 
pine timber land — a dense forest 
of trees a hundred feet hicrh and 
from one to five feet through at 
the butt. It was necessary to fence our property or m'c could 
not hold it. That is to say, it was necessary to cut down trees here 
and there and make them fall in such a way as to form a sort of. 
enclosure (with pretty wide gaps 
in it). "We cut down three trees apiece, and found it such 

heart-breaking work that we decided to "rest our case" on 

those ; if they held the property, well and good ; if they 

didn't, let the property spill out through the gaps and go ; it 

was no use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few 
acres of land. Next day we came back to build a lioiise — 
for a house was also necessary, in order to hold the property. 
We decided to build a substantial log-house and excite the 
envy of the Brigade boys ; but by the time we had cut and 
trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate, 
and so we concluded to build it of saplings. However, two 
saplings, duly cut and trimmed, compelled recognition of the 
fact that a still modester architecture would satisfy the law, 
and so we concluded to build a "brush" house. We devoted 
the next day to this work, but we did so much "sitting 
around " and discussing, that by the middle of the afternoon 
we had achieved only a half-way sort of affair which one of us 

had to watch while the other 
cut brush, lest if both turned 
our backs we might not be able to find it again, it had 
such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding 
vegetation. But we were satisfied with it. 

We were land owners 
now, duly seized and pos- 
sessed, and within the pro- 
tection of the law. Therefore we decided to take up 
our residence on our own 
domain and enjoy that large sense of 
independence which only such an experience can bring. Late the next afternoon, 
after a good long rest, we sailed 
away from the Brigade camp with all 
the provisions and cooking utensils we could carry ofi— borrow 
is the more accurate word — and just as the night was falling 
we beached the boat at our own landing. 


OUR HOUSE. 



OHAPTEE XXIII. 

IF there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our 
timber ranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be 
a sort of life which I have not read of in books or experienced 
in person. We did not see a human being but ourselves during 
the time, or hear any sounds but those that were made by the 
wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and now and 
then the far-off thunder of an avalanche. The forest about us 
was dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and bril- 
liant with sunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and 
clear, or rippled and breezy, or black and storm-tossed, accord- 
ing to !Nature's mood ; and its circling border of mountain 
domes, clothed with forests, scarred with land-slides, cloven by 
canons and valleys, and helmeted with glittering snow, fitly 
framed and finished the noble picture. The view was always 
fascinating, bewitching, entrancing. The eye was never tired 
of gazing, night or day, in calm or storm ; it suffered but one 
grief, and that was that it could not look always, but must close 
sometimes in sleep. 

We slept in the sand close to the water's edge, between two 
protecting boulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds 
for us. We never took any paregoric to nxake us sleep. At 
the first break of dawn we were always up and running foot- 
races to tone down excess of physical vigor and exuberance of 
spirits. That is, Johnny was — but I held his hat. While 
smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sen- 
tinel peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering
light as it swept down among the shadows, and set the 
captive crags and forests free. We watched the tinted pictures 
grow and brighten npon the water till every little detail of 
forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in and finished, and 
the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then to " business." 

That is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the 
north sliore. There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes 

gray, sometimes whitet 
This gives the marvelous, 
transparency of the water 
a fuller advantage than it 
has elsewhere on the lake. 
"We usually pushed out a 
hundred yards or so from 
shore, and then lay down 
on the thwart's, in the 
sun, and let the boat 
drift by the hour whither it would. We 
seldom talked. It interrupted the Sabbath 
stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and indolence 
brought. The shore 
all along was indented with deep, curved bays and coves, 
bordered by narrow sand-beaches ; and where the sand ended, 
the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space — rose 
up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and 
thickly wooded with tall pines. 

So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only 
twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct 
that the boat seemed floating in the air ! Yes, where it was 
even eighty feet deep. Every little pebble was distinct, every 
speckled trout, every hand's-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay 
on our faces, a granite boulder, as large as a village church, 
M'ould start out of the bottom apparently, and seem climbing 
up rapidly to the surface, till presently it threatened to touch 
our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar 
and avert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the 
boulder descend again, and then we could see that when we 
had been exactly above it, it must still have been twenty or 
thirty feet below the surface. Down through the transparency 
of these great depths, the water was not merely transparent,, 
but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All objects seen through it had 
a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but of every 
minute detail, which they would not have had when seen 
simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and 
airy did all spaces seem below us, and so strong was the sense 
of floating high aloft in mid-nothingness, that we called these 
boat-excursions " balloon- voyages." 

We lished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a 
week. We could see trout by the thousand winging about in 
the emptiness under us, or sleeping in shoals on the bottom, but 
they would not bite — they could see the line too plainly, per- 
haps. We frequently selected the trout we wanted, and rested 
the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his nose at a 
depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an 
annoyed manner, and shift his position. 

We bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for 
all it looked so sunny. Sometimes we rowed out to the " blue 
water," a mile or two from shore. It was as dead blue as in- 
digo there, because of the immense depth. By official measurement the 
lake in its centre is one thousand five hundred and 
twenty-five feet deep ! 

Sometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in 
camp, and smoked pipes and read some old well-worn novels. 
-At night, by the camp-fire, we played euchre and seven-up to 
strengthen the mind — and played them with cards so greasy 
and defaced that only a whole summer's acquaintance with 
them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the 
jack of diamonds. 

We never slept in our " house." It never recurred to us, 
for one thing ; and besides, it was built to hold the ground, 
and that was enough. We did not wish to strain it. 

By and by our provisions began to run short, and we 
went back to the old camp and laid in a new supply. We 
were gone all day, and reached home again about night-fall, 

pretty tired and hungry. While Johnny was carrying the 
main bulk of the provisions up to our " house " for future use, 
I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot, 
ashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the 
boat to get the frying-pan. While I was at this, I heard a 
shout from Johnny, and looking up I saw that my fire was 
galloping all over the premises ! 

Johnny was on the other side of it. He had to run through 
the flames to get to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless 
and watched the devastation. 

The ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and 
the fire touched them oft' as if they were gunpowder. It was 
wonderful to see with what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame 
traveled ! My coft'ee-pot was gone, and everything with it. 
In a minute and a half the fire seized upon a dense growth of 
dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high, and then the 
roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific. We 
were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we re- 
mained, spell-bound. 

Within half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding 
tempest of flame ! It went surging up adjacent ridges — surmounted 
them and disappeared in the canons beyond — burst 
into view upon higher and farther ridges, presently — shed a 
grander illumination abroad, and dove again — flamed out again, 
directly, higher and still higher up the mountain-side — threw 
out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and sent them 
trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts 
and ribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty 
mountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled net- 
work of red lava sti'eams. Away across the water the crags 
and domes were lit with a ruddy glare, and the firmament above 
was a reflected hell ! 

Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing 
mirror of the lake ! Both pictures were sublime, both were 
beautiful ; but that in the lake had a bewildering richness about it 
that enchanted the eye and held it with the stronger fascination. 

We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours. 

We never thought of supper, and never felt fatigue. But at 
eleven o'clock the conflagration had traveled beyond our range 
of vision, and then darkness stole down upon the landscape 
again. 

Hunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat. 
The provisions were all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go 
to see. We were homeless wanderers again, without any pro- 
perty. Our fence was gone, our house burned down ; no in- 
surance. Our pine forest was well scorched, the dead trees all 
burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away. 
Our blankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we 
lay down and went to sleep. The next morning we started 
back to the old camp, but while out a long way from shore, so 
great a storm came up that we dared not try to land. So I 
baled out the»seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled heavily 
through the billows till we had reached a point three or four 
miles beyond the camp. The storm was increasing, and it be- 
came evident that it was better to take the hazard of beaching 
the boat than go down in a hundred fathoms of water ; so we 
ran in, with tall white-caps following, and I sat down in the 
6tern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore. The instant 
the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that washed crew 
and cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble. We shivered 
in the lee of a boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all 
the night through. In the morning the tempest had gone 
down, and we paddled down to the camp without any unneces- 
sary delay. We were so starved that we ate up the rest of the 
Brigade's provisions, and then set out to Carson to tell them 
about it and ask their forgiveness. It was accorded, upon 
payment of damages. 

We made many trips to the lake after that, and had many 
a hair-breadth escape and blood-curdling adventure which will 
never be recorded in any history. 


CHAPTER XXIT. 

IKESOLYED to have a liorse to ride. I had never seen such 
wild, free, magniiicent horsemanship outside of a circus 
as these picturesquely-clad Mexicans, Californians and Mexi- 
canized Americans displayed in Carson streets every day. 
How they rode ! Leaning just gently forward out of the per- 
pendicular, easy and nonchalant, with broad slouch-hat brim 
blown square up in front, and long 74ata swinging above the 
head, they swept through the town like the wind ! The next 
minute they were only a sailing puff of dust on the far desert. 
If they trotted, they sat up gallantly and gracefully, and 
seemed part of the horse ; did not go jiggering up and down 
after the silly Miss-Nancy fashion of the riding-schools. I had 
quickly learned to tell a horse from a cow, and was full of 
anxiety to learn more. I was resolved to buy a horse. 

While the thought was rankling in my mind, the auctioneer 
came skurrying through the plaza on a black beast that had as. 
many humps and corners on him as a dromedary, and was 
necessarily uncomely ; but he was " going, going, at twenty- 
two ! — horse, saddle and bridle at twenty-two dollars, gentle- 
men ! " and I could hardly resist. 

A man whom I did not know (he turned out to be the 
auctioneer's brother) noticed the wistful look in my eye, and 
observed that that was a very remarkable horse to be going at 
such a price ; and added that the saddle alone was worth the 
money. It was a Spanish saddle, with ponderous tapidaroSy 
and furnished with the ungainly bole-leather covering with 

the imspellable name. I said I had half a notion to bid. 
Then this keen-eyed person appeared to me to be " taking my 
measure" ; but I dismissed the suspicion wlien he spoke, for his 
manner was full of guileless candor and truthfulness. Said he : 
" I know that horse — know him well. You are a stranger, 
I take it, and so you might think he was an American horse, 

"tod might think him an AMERICAN HORSE." 

maybe, but I assure you he is not. lie is nothing, of the kind ; 
but — excuse my speaking in a low voice, other people being 
near — he is, without the shadow of a doubt, a Genuine Mexi- 
can Plug ! " 

I did not know what a Genuine Mexican Plug was, but 
there was something about this man's way of saying it, that 
made me swear inwardly that I would own a Genuine Mexi- 
can Plug, or die. 

"Has he any other — er — advantages?" I inquired, sup- 
pressing what eagerness I could. 

He hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my army-shirt, 
led me to one side, and breathed in my ear impressively these 
words : 

" He can out-buck anything in America ! " 
" Going, going, going — at twent-ty-ioviY dollars and a half, 
gen — " 

" Twenty-seven ! " I shouted, in a frenzy. 
" And sold ! " said the auctioneer, and passed over the 
Genuine Mexican Plug to me. 

I could scarcely contain my exultation. I paid the money, 
and put the animal in a neighboring livery-stable to dine and 
rest himself. 

In the afternoon I brought the creature into the plaza, 
and certain citizens held him by the head, and others by 

the tail, while I mounted 
him. As soon as they let 
go, he placed all his feet 
in a bunch together, lowered his back, and then 
suddenly arched it upward, 
and shot me straight into 
the air a matter of three 
or four feet ! I came as 
straight down again, lit in 
the saddle, went instantly 
up again, came down almost on the high pommel, 
shot up again, and came 
down on the horse's neck — 
all in the space of three or 
four seconds. Then he rose 
and stood almost straight 
up on his hind feet, and I, 
clasping his lean neck desperately, slid back into the saddle, and held on. He came 
down, and immediately hoisted his heels into the air, delivering 
a vicious kick at the sky, and stood on his forefeet. 


And then down he came once more, and began the original 
exercise of shooting me straight up again. The third time I 
went up I heard a stranger say : 

" Oh, donH he buck, though ! " 

"While I was up, somebody struck the horse a sounding 
thwack with a leathern strap, and when I arrived again the 
Genuine Mexican Plug was not there. A Californian youth 
chased him up and caught him, and asked if he might have a 
ride. I granted him that luxury. lie mounted the Genuine, 
got lifted into the air once, 
out sent his spurs home as 
he descended, and the horse 
darted away like a telegram. He soared over 
three fences like a bird, 
and disappeared down the 
road toward the Washoe 
Yalley. 

I sat down on a stone, 
with a sigh, and by a natural impulse one of my 
hands sought my forehead, 
and the other the base of 
my stomach. I believe I 

never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the bmian machinery- — 
for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere. 
Pen cannot describe how I was jolted up. Imagination cannot 
conceive how disjointed I was — how internally, externally 
and universally I was unsettled, mixed up and ruptured. 
There was a sympathetic crowd aroimd me, though. 

One elderly-looking comforter said : 

" Stranger, ou've been taken in. Everybody in this 
camp knows that horse. Any child, any Injun, could have 
told you that he'd buck ; he is the very worst devil to buck on 
the continent of America. You hear me. I'm Curry. Old 
Curry. Old Abe Curry, And moreover, he is a simon-pure, 
out-and-out, genuine d — d Mexican plug, and an uncommon 
mean one at that, too. Why, yon turnip, if you had laid low 
and kept dark, there's chances to buy an American horse for 
mighty little more than you paid for that bloody old foreign 
relic." 

I gave no sign ; but I made up my mind that if the 
auctioneer's brother's funeral took place while I was in the 
Territory I would postpone all other recreations and attend it. 
After a gallop, of sixteen miles the Californian youth and 
the Genuine Mexican Plug came tearing into town again, 
shedding foam-flakes like the spume-spray that drives before a 
typhoon, and, with one final skip over a wheelbarrow and a 
Chinaman, cast anchor in front of the " ranch." 

Such panting and blowing ! Such spreading and contract- 
ing of the red equine nostrils, and glaring of the wild equine 
eye! But was the imperial beast subjugated? Indeed he 

was not. 
His 1ords hip the Speaker of 
the House thought he 
was, and mounted 
him to go 
down to the 
Capitol; but 
the first 
dash the 
creature made was over a pile of telegraph poles half as high as a 
church; and his time to the Capitol — one mile and three 
quarters — remains unbeaten to this day. But then he took an 
advantage — he left out the mile, and only did the three quar- 
ters. That is to say, lie made a straight cut across lots, preferring 
fences and ditches to a crooked road; and when the 
Speaker got to the Capitol lie said he had been in the air so 
mucli he felt as if he had made the trip on a comet. 


In the evening the Speaker came home afoot for exercise, 
and got the Genuine towed back behind a quartz wagon. 
The next day I loaned the animal to the Clerk of the House 
to go down to the Dana silver mine, six miles, and he walked 

back for exercise, and 

got the horse towed. 
Everybody I loaned 
him to always walked 
back ; they never could 
get enough exercise 
any other way. Still, 
I continued to loan 
him to anybody who 
was willing to borrow 
him, my idea being to 
get him crippled, and 
throw him on the bor- 
rower's hands, or killed, 
and make the borrower 
pay for him. But somehow nothing ever happened to him. He took 
chances that no other horse ever took all
survived, but he always came out safe. It was his daily 
habit to try experiments that had always before been con- 
sidered impossible, but he always got through. Sometimes 
he miscalculated a little, and did not get his rider through intact, but 
he always got through himself. Of course I had 
tried to sell him ; but that was a stretch of simplicity which 
met with little sympathy. The auctioneer stormed up and 
down the streets on him for four days, dispersing the populace, 
interrupting business, and destroying children, and never got a 
bid — at least never any but the eighteen-dollar one he hired 
a notoriously substanceless bummer to make. The people 
only smiled pleasantly, and restrained their desire to buy, if 
they had any. Then the auctioneer brought in his bill, and I

withdrew the horse from the market. We tried to trade him 
off at private vendue next, offering him at a sacrifice for 
second-hand tombstones, old iron, temperance tracts— any 
kind of property. But holders were stiff, and we retired from 
the market again. I never tried to ride the horse any more. 
"Walking was good enough exercise for a man like me, that 
had nothing the matter with him except ruptures, internal in- 
juries, and such things. Finally I tried to give him away. 
But it was a failure. Parties said earthquakes were handy 
enough on the Pacific coast — they did not wish to own one.
