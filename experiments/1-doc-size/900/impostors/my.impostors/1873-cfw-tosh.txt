chances for Hugh." 



" Go away ! " said Bessie in the same dull mon- 
otone ; " Hugh is dead, I tell you ! Go put 
crape on the door ! " 

" She is ill," said Mr. Leslie in a low tone to 
Aunt Faith ; " you had better take her upstairs." 

Aunt Faith roused herself from her own grief ; 
;t come, dear," she said, rising. 

" I shall not go," said Bessie ; " T shall wait 
here for Hugh." 

At this moment Tom and Gem ran into the 
room. 

" Oh, Aunt Faith ! what is it?" began Tom. 
" We met some boys and they told us that the 
America was run into last night." 

Gem looked at Bessie and Sibyl, and then 
without a word, she sat down in her little chair 
and began to cry bitterly. Aunt Faith could 
not answer Tom, the sound of Gem's violent 
weeping, and Sibyl's sobs, seemed to choke the 
words on her lips. 

" I don't believe a word of it ! " cried Tom in- 
dignantly. " Hugh can swim better than any 



 

one in Wester ton, and lie's as strong as a lion ! 
I'm going right down to the dock, and you'll see 
him coming back with me before night. " 

" Hugh is dead ! " said Bessie again ; " Hugh 
is dead ! " 

The hours passed slowly in those long min- 
utes of weary waiting in which young hearts 
grow into old age in a single day. Friends and 
neighbors flocked into the old stone house, and 
their voices were hushed as they came and went 
with kindly but useless sympathy. Mr. Leslie 
had gone to the scene of the accident on a fast 
tug, accompanied by some of Hugh's young com- 
panions, and as, during the day, different vessels 
came into port, they were boarded by anxious 
friends and the latest reports eagerly sought. 
The bank of the lake was thronged, people stood 
there with glasses, in spite of the steady rain, 
scanning the eastern horizon in the hope of dis- 
covering the smoke of approaching propellers. 
Others had friends on board the America be- 
sides the family at the old stone house. But 



 

Hugh was well known and well liked, and his 
was the only young life among those still missing 
from Westerton ; the others were middled-aged 
or old, and with that universal sympathy which 
the death of a bright vigorous youth always 
awakens, the whole town mourned for Hugh, and 
stories of his generous, manly nature, flew from 
mouth to mouth, until even strangers felt that 
they knew him, 

At five o'clock a tug returned bringing a man 
and wife exhausted with twelve hours in the 
water lashed to floating spars ; but they soon re- 
vived, and the good news flew through the city, 
and friends told it to the family in the old stone 
house, clustered together around Bessie, who had 
not changed her attitude or tasted food since 
morning. "If they were saved, why not Hugh ? " 
they said hopefully. 

" Hugh is dead ! " repeated Bessie ; " they will 
bring him home, poor drowned Hugh ! " Sibyl 
broke forth into violent weeping, and Aunt Faith 
shuddered at Bessie's words. " Can you not 



 

persuade Bessie to go upstairs and lie down ? " 
said a lady friend, looking apprehensively at the 
young girl's fixed eyes. 

Aunt Faith shook her head. " We must leave 
her to herself for the present," she answered sad- 
ly ; " her grief is beyond expression now." 

Later in the day, the tug Mr. Leslie had taken 
was sighted from the bank, and a crowd assem- 
bled on the dock, with the feeling that suspense 
would soon be over. 

" They would not have come back so soon un- 
less they had found him," said one ; " they would 
have cruised around there for a day^or two as 
long as there was any hope." 

" But they don't hoist any signal," said anoth- 
er ; " they must know we are Avaiting here." 

The little tug came rapidly in, watched by 
hundreds of eyes, and when at last she ap- 
proached the dock, the anxiety grew intense. 
There came no shout from those on board, the 
quiet was ominous, and, chilled by a sudden awe, 
the crowd stepped back, and awaited the result 




in silence. The boat was made fast, and then, 
after a short delay, the young men came forth 
bearing the shrouded form of their late compan- 
ion, now still in death. Hugh was dead, then ? 
Yes, Hugh was dead ! 

But he had not died in vain, and the story of 
his death was repeated from mouth to mouth 
throughout the city ; women heard it and sobbed 
aloud, as they held their darlings closer ; men 
heard it and spoke a few brief words of praise 
and regret to which their wet eyes gave empha- 
sis. 

About half-past eleven the previous night, the 
America had been struck amidships by an 
unknown schooner driving down unseen in the 
intense darkness of the storm. Most of the 
passengers had gone to their state-rooms, but 
Hugh was still in the cabin ; rushing out on 
deck he saw and heard that the boat would sirik, 
and, accompanied by the captain, ran back 
through the cabin, arousing the passengers and 
telling them of the danger. In an instant all 



 

was confusion, agony, and despair ; some of the 
men leaped overboard, buc the women with their 
instinctive shrinking from the dark water, could 
not be persuaded to leave the deck. A few 
passengers and part of the crew got off in one 
of the small boats, but the other boats were 
swamped by the rush into them ; a cry went up 
that the steamer was sinking, and Hugh was 
seen to jump overboard with a little child in his 
arms, a baby whose mother had held it implor- 
ingly towards him, as he tried to persuade her to 
take the dangerous leap. " Take the child," 
she said ; " I will follow you," and then as they 
disappeared, with a wild cry the poor woman 
flunsf herself over after them. In the mean 
time the captain and some of the hands and pas- 
sengers had ascended to the hurricane deck, 
and when the America sank, the force of the 
waves separated the deck from the hull, and it 
floated off, a frail support for the little group it 
carried. The lake was strewn with fragments, 
spars and barrels, and to these many persons 
were clinging. Hugh had managed to secure a 

piece of broken mast with spars attached, and 

with its aid he supported the mother and child 

until an iron-bound cask, caught in the cordage, 

struck him heavily in the darkness. The mother 

heard him groan, and his grasp loosened. 

" Quick ! " he said hoarsely- ; " I cannot hold 

you. I must fasten you with these floating 

ropes ; I am badly hurt, but I think I can hold 

the child." 

He bound the ropes and rigging about her, 

and told her how she could best support herself ; 

then he was silent, but every now and then she 

heard him moaning as though in pain. How 

long they floated in this way the mother could 

not tell ; it seemed to her many hours, — it was, 

in reality, less than four. They saw the lights of 

the Empire in the distance, but they could not 

make themselves heard, although they shouted 

with all their strength. At the first glimmering 

of dawn they discovered the hurricane deck not 

far distant, and Hugh said, " shout with all your 
 

might. I cannot hold on much longer, my head 
is on fire ! " So the mother exerted all her 
strength in a piercing scream, and to her joy, an 
answering cry came back through the rain. 
Hugh made an effort to steer the spars towards 
the floating deck, and those on board pushed 
their raft towards him as well as they could. 
Still it was slow work, and as the dawn grew 
brighter, the mother saw her preserver's haggard 
face, and the blood matted in his curly hair. He 
did not speak, as, holding the baby in one arm, 
with the other he tried to guide the broken 
mast, but his eyes were strangely glazed and the 
shadow of death was on his brow. They 
reached the deck at last, and kind have lifted 
them on board ; it was only a raft, but it seemed 
a support after the deep, dark watc. The 
mother took her baby, and Hugh sank down at 
her feet. Some one had a flask of bra/\dy, and 
they succeeded in pouring a little tV.-ough his 
clenched teeth ; after a moment o? two he 
revived, sat up, looked about him, and murmured 




some incoherent words. Then he tiiecl to take 
out his little note-book, but it was wet, and 
the pencil was gone ; the captain gave him his 
own, and Hugh had scrawled a few words upon 
it, spoke to the mother and smiled when she 
held up the child. But gradually he relapsed 
into unconsciousness, grew more and more 
death-like, and, after breathing heavily for an 
hour, passed away without a struggle The 
mother and her child were safe ; all the others on 
the floating deck were rescued, — but Hugh, 
dear Hugh was dead ! 

Mr. Leslie had preceded the funeral cortege by 
a few moments ; slowly he alighted from the 
carriage and passed up the garden-walk towards 
the old stone house. His heart was heavy, and 
words of comfort came not to his lips ; in the 
presence of so great a sorrow he bowed his 
head in silence. The friends who were in the 
house, came out to meet him, but no one spoke ; 
they knew by his face that the worst was true. 
They did not follow him into the presence of 



 

the mourners, but going down to the gate, they 
waited there. 

' Mr. Leslie entered the sitting-room. " The 
Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away," he 
said solemnly. "Blessed be the name of the 
Lord. Hugh, our dear Hugh is dead." 

Sibyl screamed and fell back fainting, the 
children burst into tears, and Aunt Faith knelt 
down by her chair and hid her face in her hands. 
Bessie alone was calm. " Are they bringing 
him home ? " she asked, lifting her tearless eyes 
to Mr. Leslie's face. 

" Yes Bessie ; they will soon be here, now." 

Without reply she rose, smoothed her dis- 
ordered curls and arranged her dress. " Sibyl," 
she said, " do not cry ; Hugh never could bear 
to hear any one cry! Aunt Faith, Hugh is 
coming. Let us go to meet him." 

Her strange composure awed the violent 
grief of the others into silence, and they followed 
her mechanically as she led the way to the piazza; 
involuntarily they all took the positions of the 





previous evening, and, with Bessie standing 
alone in the centre, they waited for their dead. 

The young men bore their burden up the 
walk slowly and solemnly, and behind followed 
a train of sorrowing friends, two and two, thus 
rendering respect to the youth who had so 
suddenly been taken from them in all the flush 
and vigor of early manhood. On came the sad 
procession, and when the bearers reached the 
piazza, the friends fell back and stood with 
uncovered heads, as up the steps, and under the 
faded triumphal arch, Hugh Warrington came 
home for the last time to the old stone house. 

At midnight Aunt Faith went softly into the 
parlor ; a faint light shone from the chandelier 
upon the still figure beneath, and Bessie with 
her face hidden in her hands, sat by its side. 
She did not move as Aunt Faith came to her ; 
she did not answer when Aunt Faith spoke to 
her ; she seemed almost as cold and rigid as the 
dead. 

" Bessie dear, I have something to show you," 



 

said Aunt Faith, in a low tone ; " I have a letter 
to you from Hugh." 

Bessie started and looked up ; her face was 
pinched and colorless, and her dark eyes wild 
and despairing. 

" I have a letter to you, dear, from Hugh," 
repeated Aunt Faith; "he wrote it on board 
the floating deck just before he died." 

" Give it to me," said Bessie hoarsely, holding 
out her cold hands. 

" In a moment, dear. Come upstairs with me 
and you shall see it," answered Aunt Faith, 
trying to lead her away. But Bessie resisted 
wildly. " I will not go ! " she said. " I shall 
stay with Hugh until the last. Give me my 
letter ! It is mine ! You have no right to keep it. 
Give it to me, I say ! " 

Alarmed at the expression of her eyes, Aunt 
Faith took out the captain's note-book, opened it, 
and handed it to her niece. The words were 
scrawled across the page in irregular lines ; 
there seemed to be two paragraphs. The first 





was this : " Bessie, try to be good, dear ; I love 
you." The second : " I can say the two sen- 
tences, Aunt Faith, — I am saying them now. — 
Hugh." 

The writing was trembling and indistinct, and 
the last words barely legible ; the signature was 
but a blur. 

As Bessie deciphered the two messages, a 
sudden tremor shook her frame ; then she read 
them over again, speaking the words aloud as 
if to give them reality. " Oh Hugh ! Hugh ! " 
she cried, " how can I live without you ! " 

With a quick movement, Aunt Faith turned 
up the gas and threw back the pall ; then she 
put her arms around the desolate girl and raised 
her to her feet. "Look at him, Bessie!" she 
said earnestly ; " look at dear Hugh, and think 
how hard it must have been for him to write 
those words, how hard he must have tried, how 
much he must have loved you ! " 

Hugh's face was calm, the curling, golden hair 
concealed the cruel wound on his temple, and 



 

there was a beautiful expression about the 
mouth, that strange peace which sometimes 
comes after death, as if sent to comfort the 
mourners. His right hand, bruised by the hard 
night's work, was covered with vine-leaves, but 
the left, the hand that had held the little child, 
was folded across his breast ; he was dressed as 
he had been in life, and some one had placed 
a cross on his heart, — a little cross of ivy simply 
twined. " My soldier, true soldier of the cross, " 
murmured Aunt Faith, stooping to kiss the cold 
brow. " In those hours it all became clear to 
you. 'Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbe- 
lief ; ' — ' Lord be merciful to me a sinner.' 
With these two sentences on your lips, you 
passed into another country. Farewell, Hugh! 
You will not return to us, but. we shall go to 

you." 

Bessie had not raised her head from Aunt 
Faith's shoulder. She had not looked upon 
Hugh since they brought him home, and now 
she stood holding the note-book in her hands, 
and trembling convulsively. 





" Look at him, Bessie," said Aunt Faith 
again ; " look at dear Hugh. He is speaking to 
you now, in that dying message." 

At last Bessie raised her head and looked upon 
the still face long and earnestly ; then, throw- 
ing herself down upon her knees, she burst into 
a passion of wild grief, calling upon Hugh, be- 
seeching him to speak to her, and listening for 
his answer in vain. Aunt Faith did not try to 
check her, for these were her first tears ; she 
knew they would relieve that tension of the head 
and heart, which, if long continued, must have 
ended in physical and mental prostration. After 
a few moments, Sibyl came in, and the two 
watched over Bessie until she sank exhausted to 
the floor, when they lifted her slight form and 
bore her upstairs. 

Then, from the sitting-room, two of Hugh's 
friends came in, turned down the light, covered 
the still face, and went back to keep their watch 
in the desolate hours of mourning. 

The sun was sinking towards the west in unclouded 
brightness when a throng gathered in 

the old stone house to pay their last tribute of 
respect to the dead. " Fitz Hugh Warrington, 
aged twenty years and ten months," said the 
inscription on the coffin-lid, and many tears 
dropped upon it, as, one by one, the friends bent 
over to take a farewell look at the handsome face 
with its clustering golden hair. Then came the 
voice of the aged pastor, reading the words of the 
Gospel of St. John, — Hugh's favorite chapter, the 
fourteenth. A hymn followed, — Hugh's favor- 
ite hymn, " Brightest and best of the sons of the 
morning," and then they all knelt in prayer, the 
fervent prayer mingled with tears which ascends 
from the house where the dearest one of all is 
dead. 

Mr. Leslie took no part in the services ; he 
stood with Sibyl as one of the family. Aunt 
Faith leaned upon the arm of Mr. Hastings, who 
had come from New York immediately upon 
hearing of the accident. Tom and Gem stood 
together, but Bessie was alone ; she wished no 





support, she said ; she only wanted to stay by 
Hugh until the last. So they let her stand by 
the head of the coffin alone, — alone* with her 
dead, and with her God. 

Then came another hymn, and slowly the 
bearers lifted all that was left of their friend, 
and bore it forth under the same faded flower- 
arch, and down the garden- walk, where the 
throng made way for them on either side as they 
passed. 

The bun was setting, and, standing on the 
piazza, the choir sang, — 

"Abide with me ; fast falls the even- tide, 
The darkness deepens ; Lord, with me abide ; 
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, 

Help of the helpless, Oh abide with me. 

I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless, 
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness ; 
Where is death's sting, where, grave, thy victory ? 
I triumph still, if Thou abide with rue." 




YEAR Lad passed, and the colored 
leaves were dropping for the second 
time upon Hugh's grave. Aunt Faith 
and Bessie were in the sitting-room of 
the old stone house, and the voices of Tom and 
Gem sounded through the open hall-door from the 
back garden, where they were sitting under the 
oak-tree. Hugh's portrait stood upon an easel, 
with living ivy growing around it from the little 
bracket which he had made that last day of sum- 
mer. The afternoon sun struck the picture, and 

gave it a vivid realistic expression ; Bessie saw 

 

it, and laying down her work, looked lovingly 
into the bright face. " It is very like Hugh, is 
it not, Aunt Faith ? " she said at last. 

Aunt Faith put on her glasses, and drew nearer 
the easel. " It is indeed a wonderful likeness, 
especially the eyes," she replied. " How came 
you to succeed so well ? " 

" I had been working at it all summer, aunt, 
but the eyes I could not copy to my satisfaction, 
they varied so constantly. It was Hugh's last 
day at home ; don't you remember how I begged 
for the morning ? He was sitting in the old arm- 
chair by the window, looking out towards the 
lake, talking about the future ; he was so full of 
life and hope that morning, — so sure of success, — 
so happy in the thought of the good he could ac- 
complish, that his eyes fairly shone. Something 
came over me ; I took the brush, and, by a sud- 
den inspiration, I succeeded in copying the ex- 
pression exactly." 

" It is a comfort to have the picture," said 
Aunt Faith, " and a blessed thought that we 



 

shall see that dear face again, and know it when 
we see it." 

" You believe so, aunt ? So do I. I believe 
that we shall love each other there as here, only 
far, far better. To be with those we love, away 
from affliction, care, and temptation, — that is 
heaven." 

" I often think of the meetings there, Bessie. 
Hugh found his father and his mother there. 
While we were mourning here, they were re- 
joicing there." 

"I no longer mourn, Aunt Faith; I have 
found comfort." 

"I know that, my dear, and am thankful for 
it ; but you are sad at times." 

" I feel sad over myself, aunt, over my lone- 
liness, and my faults. I feel sorry for myself as 
one feels sorry for a child ; I sympathize with 
myself as though I was another person. Some- 
times it seems as if my soul sat apart peaceful 
and quiet, while all the rest of me gave way to 
deep despondency. But all the while I know 



 

that Hugh is safe ; that I shall go to him, and 
that through the mercy of our Saviour we shall 
find eternal joy. And I always try to remem- 
ber that Hugh disliked morbid grief; that he 
used to say the world was a beautiful place ; that 
we had no right to despise it; that as long as we 
were in it, it was our duty to make others happy 
and be happy ourselves. Therefore I try to be 
cheerful, and when I think of Hugh, I am cheer- 
ful. It is only when I think of myself that 
despondency comes back to me." 

" You have done well, dear," said Aunt Faith ; 
" I have seen your struggles, and rejoiced over 
your victories. I have confidence in you, Bes- 
sie, and if I am called away, I can leave the chil- 
dren in your charge with an easy heart." 

" They are no longer children, Aunt Faith." 
 " True ! Gem is thirteen, but she will need 
watchful care for many years yet. And Tom, 
although tall and strong, is still a thorough boy 
at heart, and the next five or six years are full of 
danger for him." 



 

" Tom is a fine fellow," said Bessie warmly ; 
" he is full of generosity and courage." 

" Yes, but there are corresponding dangers for 
his sanguine temperament. However, although 
still young, he has an earnest faith ; Hugh's death 
was a lesson which he will never forget, and al- 
though he may often go astray, I feel sure he will 
come back again at the last. Gem, too, is one 
of the lambs of the flock ; she has improved 
greatly the past year. I have had deep cause to 
be thankful, and I am thankful," said Aunt Faith, 
folding her hands reverently. " The children 
Thou gavest to me are all Thine ; Thou hast 
cared for them and brought them to a knowledge 
of Thy goodness. One hast Thou taken, the 
dearest of all ; taken him away from trouble to 
come. Lord, I thank Thee, for all Thy good- 
ness." As Aunt Faith murmured these words, 
she leaned back in her chair and closed her own 
heart in silence. 

After a few moments, Bessie went out on 
the piazza to welcome Mr. Leslie and Sibyl as 
they came up the walk. 


' Aunt Faith is resting in her chair," she said, 
smiling ; " we will sit out here, if you please. 
How well you look, Sibyl ! " 

Mrs. Leslie threw off her bonnet, and the light 
shone in her golden hair. She looked well, bet- 
ter than she bad ever looked as Sibyl Warring- 
ton ; for, although her skin had lost something of 
its extreme delicacy, her face had gained in ani- 
mation, and her manners in cordiality, so that 
people who could not love her before, loved her 
now with sincere affection. Her beautiful hair 
was coiled gracefully around her head, and she 
was dressed with as much care as ever, for Sibyl 
was Sibyl still, and could no more change her 
love for harmony and taste than the leopard 
could change his spots. But everything was sim- 
ple, inexpensive, and fashioned by her own fin- 
gers, so that although all admired, not even the 
most censorious could find fault with the appear- 
ance of the pastor's wife. 

Mr. Leslie, too, was somewhat altered ; he 

looked well and vigorous, but his manner was 
 

more gentle. The poor said be was more com- 
passionate, the sick said he was more gentle, his 
congregation said he was more eloquent ; Hugh's 
death raid Sibyl's sorrow had not been without 
their lessons for him, also. 

The little chapel was still poor and struggling, 
but husband and wife worked together with heart 
and strength. Sibyl was invaluable ; she threw 
her system, her energy, and her tact into the 
week-day work, and her husband found his Sun- 
day labors doubly successful, because they were 
followed up and carried out during the six work- 
ing days as well as on the day of rest. 

u I have had a letter from Mrs. Stanly, to-day, 
Bessie," said Mr. Leslie ; " she says little Hugh 
is beginning to talk, and already can say ' Aunt 
Bessie.' He associates you with the Noah's Ark 
you sent him. Here is his picture, enclosed in 
the letter." The photograph represented a 
chubby boy with large, wondering eyes and curly 
hair. 

" Brave little man!" said Sibyl, looking over 
Bessie's shoulder. " What a wonder he lived 
through that night ! " 

" Oh, Hugh held him up out of the water 
most of the time," said Bessie quickly; " the 
mother told me that his little knitted shirt was 
scarcely wet at all. I must certainly go East to 
see the child next spring, now that his father is 
dead, I feel more at liberty to assist Mrs. Stanly, 
and, between us, we are going to give little Hugh 
the best education the country will allow." 

" Is that you, Sibyl? " said Aunt Faith's voice 
within. 

" Yes, aunt. Shall we come in ? " said Mrs. 
Leslie, rising. 

u No, dear, I will come out ; " and Aunt Faith 
joined the group on the piazza, taking her seat in 
an arm-chair. 

" What a beautiful afternoon ! " she said, " and 
how brilliant those maple-leaves are ! Have yo u 
been the monument, John? " 

" No," answered Mr. Leslie ; " is it in place ? " 

' Yes, the work was all finished this morning, 



 

and Bessie and I went over to look at it. Why 
not walk over now ? We can all go, and these 
lovely days cannot last long." 

" I should like to go, John, if you have the 
time," said Sibyl. 

" Yes ; I can postpone the visit I intended to 
make. As Aunt Faith says, these warm, still 
days cannot last long." 

The cemeterjr was about half a mile distant, a 
forest glade sloping to the lake, with a brook in a 
little ravine running through the centre. But 
few graves were there, for the land was but new- 
ly consecrated to its use, but the great forest- 
trees were old, and in the spring, wild flowers 
grew everywhere, and wild birds sang in the fo- 
liage. Now, the trees were dyed in scarlet and 
gold, and the colored leaves dropped slowly 
down upon the ground, for the air was still and 
hazy with the purple mists of Indian summer. 
Hugh's monument stood on a little eminence 
overlooking the lake. It was of marble, a slen- 
der shaft broken at the top, with a profusion of 
roses growing over the broken place, carved in 
the marble with life-like fidelity, so that the stone 
itself seemed to have blossomed. Below, on one 
side of the base was Hugh's name and age, and 
on the opposite face was the sentence, " I shall 
go to him, but he shall not return to me." 

" I like it," said Mr. Leslie, standing with un- 
covered head beside the grassy mound ; " it ex- 
presses the idea of the broken young life, and 
the roses of hope, faith, and even joy which have 
grown up to cover the place." 

" It is appropriate that it stands here over- 
looking the lake," said Sibyl. "Hugh was so 
fond of the water, and, on this very lake lie lost 
his life, — gave it up for the sake of others." 

" And I like the monument on account of the 
sentence," said Bessie, who sat by the side of the 
grave arranging a bunch of autumn leaves. 

" The monument is only raised to Hugh's 
earthly memory," said Aunt Faith. "Hugh is 
not here ; I never feel that I am nearer to him 
here than at home. But I like to honor the 

place where his mortal body lies, and I like to 
think when I die, those who love me will like- 
wise honor my grave." 

Bessie completed her wreath and laid it on 
the mound, and then they all went back to the 
old stone house, quiet and thoughtful, but not 
sad ; the faith within their hearts was too 
earnest, and the hope too bright for sadness. 

After tea they sat together on the piazza ; the 
night was warm, and the full-moon shone 
through the haze, giving the landscape a magi- 
cal softness and beauty. Tom and Gem were 
there also, and at Tom's feet were the three dogs, 
Turk, somewhat sobered, Grip, less hilarious 
than formerly, but Pete Trone, Esquire, as 
vivacious as ever, investigating ever}' corner of 
the garden as though he never saw it before, 
and coming back after each foray with increased 
importance, the air of a philosopher who had 
discovered all the secrets of the moonlight. 
Friends came in and joined the family circle. 
Rose Saxon, Edith Chase, who had become one 

of Bessie's firm friends, and Walter Hart. An 
hour or two of pleasant conversation ensued, 
and Tom delivered some bright sayings, retiring 
within the shadow, overcome with boyish em- 
barrassment when the company applauded him. 
Finally, when the visitors had all gone, Aunt 
Faith rose ; " I hope you will stay to prayers, 
John," she said ; " it is late, but the bright 
moonlight seems to postpone the hour of sleep- 
ing." 

" Yes, Aunt Faith," replied Mr. Leslie ; " we 
will stay, and Sibyl can play the hymn." 

He read a chapter from the Bible, then they 
all sang a hymn and knelt a few moments in 
prayer. With affectionate farewells, they parted 
for the night, Sibyl and her husband going home 
through the moonlight, and the others separat- 
ing to their respective rooms. 

As Bessie stood before her dressing-table, 
brushing out her thick curls, she noticed the 
lines about her mouth, and the hollows in her 
temples. " I am growing old," she thought, 



 

with a half-smile, " and yet, I am only seventeen. 
How long this year has been ; it is like a life- 
time. But yet, it has been a precious year ; it 
has taught me hope and peace. I shudder when 
I think how I felt a year ago." 

Going across the room, she lifted a little 
curtain which hung before a picture ; the frame 
contained only a fragment of paper, and through 
the glass the faint pencilled words of Hugh's 
last message could be seen. " Bessie, try to be 
good, dear. I love you." Bessie read the 
words over several times, and then, dropping 
the little curtain, she fell on her knees by the 
bedside, and prayed Hugh's prayer. " Lord I

to Tom and Gem, and afterwards to the poor 
and afflicted. She worked hard, and in the 
very labor she found peace at the last; she 
tried to make others happy, and, in the end, she 
found happiness for herself. 

Aunt Faith sat by her table, thinking. She 
was thinking of her loved ones, her father and 
mother, her brothers and sisters, her husband, 
and last of all, of Hugh. " For the past month 
my strength has seemed to fail ; it may be that I 
am nearer home than I know," she thought. 

" But all my times are in Thy hand, dear 
Lord, and whether I go soon, or whether I must 
tarry many years longer, Thou knowest. Only
