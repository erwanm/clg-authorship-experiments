half-unconscious pressure, her head sunk upon his 
breast. 

"No, it was not that." His voice had a strange, 
strangled sound, and then he paused for many seconds. 

" Something came in my mind just then a subject 
that has troubled me sorely. Help me to decide, 
Hope." 

" If I can." 

" Hope," the voice was tremulous as well as husky, 
now, "suppose one man committed a deadly sin 



 

against another, in one of those evil moments of life when 
temptation was strong, and human nature weak. It 
changed the man's whole course, deprived him of home, 
caused him much suffering ; but if the other repented 
sincerely, humbly, and made all the restitution in his 
power, do you think he could be forgiven?" 

" Why not, Stephen ? " 

" O, you do not understand," and he roused himself. 
" What if it had been you. If some one had wronged 
you bitterly, deprived you of every pleasure and com- 
fort, sent you into the world " 

"An outcast, a beggar, as I was. And Mr. For- 
syth wronged me. No, don't speak. Has he come 
back?" 

That answered Stephen Dane's purpose as an illustra- 
tion. " Well, if he had returned," he went on, hurried- 
ly, " if he made or was willing to make all the repara- 
tion in his power, could you forgive him ? " 

"I could not forget that he had sinned against an- 
other as well. Sometimes one feels the wrongs of 
one's friends more keenly than one's own. And poor 
mamma ! " 

Stephen struck his clenched hand to his forehead. 
The pulses in his temple throbbed with passionate 
anguish. Yes, if she knew all, she would hate him for 
his father's crime. 

" You couldn't forgive him then ? " There was a 



 

despairing entreaty in his tone, something that pleaded 
powerfully, but could not hope. 

"It would be hard, but I should do it at last, because 
it was right. Only I couldn't love him." 

" No ; a man must be wild to expect it. A blind, 
weak fool ! O, Hope, there is just such a man in the 
world, and he cannot feel satisfied with the forgiveness 
he wants the love. His life looks so barren without it ! 
But it is right. God means every sin shall be atoned 
for by its kind. Dear, it is cruel for me to torment 
you." 

His manner moved her strangely. 

"It is Mr. Forsyth," she said. "I forgive him be- 
cause you plead for him, because I " she was about 
to add, " because I love you," in its simplest fashion ; 
and then, with a great rush of feeling, that drowned out 
every other thought, she knew she could never utter the 
words again until he asked for them. The innocence 
of ignorance was gone, and love was almost shamed into 
.guilt by the suddenness of the revelation ; so she stood 
trembling in his arms. 

He mistook her agitation. 

"Xo," he answered, "it is not Mr. Forsyth. I don't 
think he will ever be so far repentant" with a grim, 
hard smile. " It was another man." 

Hope's breath came hard and rapid. Stephen felt it 
against his heart. "Forgive me," he said, softly. 

" No, you have never sinned against me." 



 

"If I had?" 

For answer she raised her face until it met his, and 
kissed him. A vague suspicion entered his mind, but he 
dared not even give it room. Then he put her away 
from him, and walked slowly through the hall, bewil- 
dered. If it was possible to believe ! 

Hope threw herself on the sofa, and buried her head 
deep in the pillow. The burning face, with the temples 
throbbing so wildly from an emotion that was neither 
fear nor expectation, but something quite new and over- 
whelming. She could not think. She only breathed 
until Joe called. 

"Do you know it is almost nine, Hope? What are 
you doing ? " 

Hope ran for her hat and shawl, gathered up her 
books, and was off to school. The wild March blast 
blew in her face, but she never heeded it. The thick 
gray skies lowered about her, yet she was insensible to 
their influence. She could not seem to waken herself 
from the strange spell. 

Joe had the house to herself all day. Ivaty would 
not let her do any work, but settled her on the sofa, and 
tied up her aching head with a napkin dripping with 
aromatic vinegar ; and there Hope found her on her 
return at three in the afternoon. She petted her a little 
while. There was something magnetic in Hope's 
fingers, as well as her smile. And to-day, a wonderful 
lifjht in her face that startled Joe. 



 

" What is the matter ? " she asked, at length. 

" Nothing. I am seventeen, you know. I ought to 
look different." 

" I don't see why," was Joe's pettish rejoinder, think- 
ing of her own lost and unlovely youth. Yet at seven- 
teen she had dreamed. How vain and idle it had 
proved ! 

Stephen, coming in, found Hope kneeling beside his 
cousin, one white, slender hand in Joe's raven hair. 

" There ! " he exclaimed, dropping a box into the 
other. 

She opened it with a child's eager delight. A beauti- 
ful set of pearls. 

" O, you are so good isn't he, Joe? I wanted 
pearls so much ! A thousand thanks ! " 

Then their eyes met, and hers drooped, while a dainty 
hue flitted over her face. 

"I'm sorry you are sick, Joe," she went on, to hide 
her embarrassment. " We ought to have a good gay 
time, for one can never be seventeen again." 

" No ; " and the tears overflowed Joe's eyes. The 
world seemed wide, and weary, and desolate. 

She came out to dinner, though Hope took the head 
of the table. Stephen watched her with a new interest, 
and, like Joe, thought something strangely beguiling 
had taken possession of her. It was not so much in 
what she said as what she did, and even her very 
silence was expressive. 




 

The night closed in with a storm. Joe's headache 
grew worse ; perhaps, too, there was an undefined pain 
in her heart, that could have no name. As if she felt the 
storm, that was to overwhelm her some day, slowly 
coming on, and she must gather up her forces to resist 
it. She cowered pitifully in the dumb anguish of mental 
as well as physical pain, and wanted darkness and soli- 
tude. I do not know that she prayed for any courage 
or strength ; she had no faith just then. 

When Hope could keep her on the sofa no longer, 
she accompanied her to her sleeping-room. Joe sub- 
mitted to the ministrations of the soft fingers, because 
she felt too weak and miserable to resist ; but once in 
bed, she would not allow Hope to remain. 

It seemed so odd for the young girl to spend that 
whole evening with Stephen I They were so rarely 
alone, except for some few stray moments I This very 
distance had made love stronger and keener. 

She took her sewing and went on quietly, now and 
then giving Stephen a furtive glance. lie sat just before 
the grate, they always used the grate in this room ; 
it was his fancy, and now, with his head a little 
bowed, he was peering into the ruddy glare. Hope 
studied the broad shoulders, the clustering chestnut 
curls, the proud, almost massive head. He was so 
good, so strong, that it rested her to look at him. And 
then she thought of their morning's talk. What had it 
meant? All day she had been wondering if it was possi- 



 

ble that Mr. Forsyth had returned. But, then, he 
could have nothing to do with her. 

Stephen turned suddenly, and caught the glance of 
her steadfast eyes. Tney did not even waver, so intent 
was she. 

" A dull birthday, Hope. Next year we must have 
the party." 

" You give me something better than parties every day 
of my life," she said, gravely. w lt has been a long, 
bright holiday since I have known you." 

"Has it? I am glad. I meant it to be." 

She came and stood beside him, moved by some sud- 
den impulse. He glanced searchingly into her face. 
Was this a girlish whim, or did it have a deeper 
meaning ? 

"Stephen," she said, "will you tell me more about 
the man you spoke of this morning ? " 

" Does he interest you ? It has been a perplexing 
question to me, how far he had a right to take for- 
giveness, even." 

" He should take it just as freely as it was extended 
to him. And if he repented truly, he in some sort 
earned the forgiveness." 

" God knows he did. Hope, do you believe forgive- 
ness washes away sin ? " 

"Truly and fully." 

" And that blight effaced by years of earnest endeavor 



 

to do rightly and deal justly, raises him once more to 
the ranks of his fellow-men ? " 

" I wish you would tell me the story, Stephen." 

"No, I cannot. It is another person's secret, too. 
The story of a sad, gnarled, wretched life, that might 
have been so much better. Two lives merged into one, 
as it were ; the later always trying to make amends for 
the earlier. And when the toil was done, the justifica- 
tion worked out as far as human, hands could do it, you 
think this poor, burdened soul might dare to taste the 
cup of happiness held to his lips ? " 

She could not tell how it was, but she connected him 
with the story. Something in his past life that had 
gone wrong, a mistake crime she could not impute to 
him. The effects of this had shadowed his life. If she 
could banish this cloud ! 

" Yes," she said, resolutely. " If God brings happi- 
ness to any man or woman, after a long and sore punish- 
ment, and the proud soul casts it aside, it is blackest 
ingratitude." 

" I think God has brought it to me ; " low and softly, 
drawing her down on his knee, and enfolding her with 
his arms. The one home in the wide world to her. 

He had been struggling fiercely with himself all day, 
carrying about a certainty that Hope Vennard loved him. 
Jf she did, nothing could justify him in making her un- 
happy. True, she was young, and had seen little of the 



 

world. There might be others The hard grip jealousy 
gave his heart told him how strong and dominant his 
love was, how resolved to gain its object. All of life 
was as nothing compared to this one little girl. Yet he 
had forced himself into a patient mood before his return 
home, resolved to wait without one overt act, until he 
read her secret. If he became necessary to her, the 
question would be decided by something higher than 
merely his own wishes. 

Holding her there, his reasoning all went to the winds. 
The warm, fragrant breath upon his cheek, the red of 
the sweet lips, made redder by the glow of the fire-light, 
the drooping lids, with their long fringes hiding some 
secret in the eyes, he was but a man, after all. 

"Hope, I love you." 

Only a whisper a breath. It was so deathly still 
afterwards that they could hear their hearts beat. 

" What is it ? " and now his voice trembled with its 
vehement passion. 

"What can it be, Stephen? Only one thing." 

" You love me ? " 

" I love you." 

The story of both lives was told. Tender kisses and 
happy silence. 

Why need she know that miserable history ? Surely 
God would not hold him answerable for the sin of 
another. And now his whole heart, his whole exist- 



 

ence, should make it up to Hope. No wish should ever 
be left ungratified, no want experienced. For the past, 
let it go. He shook it off like an old garment, and sat 
there enfranchised by love. All the long-repressed 
strength and sweetness of his nature came out now. He 
drank such delicious draughts of happiness that heart 
and brain blazed up into a subtile flame. Why, he had 
just learned what it was to live ! 

He would have lingered there until morning but for 
Hope. Consciousness came to her first. The fire in 
the grate had fallen into a sleepy smoulder. Katy had 
long since locked the doors and gone to bed. And now 
Hope pleaded for a release. 

He stood up at length, with his arm still around her. 
He took her to the light, and studied her face, full of 
bashful blushes. 

"You are mine," he said, exultantly. "And if no 
dearer tie should come between us, you would still be 
mine. If it was forbidden in this world that I should 
call you by the sweetest of all names, wife, you could 
never give the right to another. Is it not so ? " 

W I am yours for all time, Stephen ; " and there was a 
strong and solemn cadence in her voice. 

"Thank God!" ' 

She went to her room, but he sat over the dying fire 
and dreamed. 



 



X. 

Two WOMEN. 

HOPE remained for her music lesson the next day, 
and when she came home, dinner was on the 
table. Her quick eye noticed there was no plate for 
Stephen. It flashed upon her, as foolish misgivings 
often do, what if she should never see him again ! 

" Where is Stephen?" she asked, rather fearfully. 

M Gone to Washington for several days. He was 
sorry to start in such a hurry, and left his good-by 
with me." 

" And you are better, Joe. I'm so glad ! " 

" My head doesn't ache, but I feel miserably weak. I 
shall be all right in a few days." 

They ate their dinner almost in silence. Hope went 
to her room afterwards in a curious mood, longing to be 
alone, and yet strangely lonesome. She glanced out of 
the window towards the west. The sun was setting in 
the cold March sky, pale-blue overhead, with streaks of 
salmon-color deepening into orange. No rose or soft, 



 

hazy purples to break the monotony with their fleecy 
drifts. 

Turning, a letter on the table caught her eye. " Hope 
Vennard," written in the clear, bold hand she knew so 
well. It was like Stephen Dane's face trusty. She 
could almost see the honest light in the earnest, brown 
eyes. 

She pressed it to her lips first, murmuring thanks for 
his thoughtful regard. Then she dallied with the seal, 
in her sweet, girlish fashion, quaffing the anticipated de- 
light slowly. There was the beginning, at length, 
" Hope, my darling ! " 

A long, long letter. She strained her eyes by the 
waning light to read the last. It seemed as if he had 
said nothing before, and all was here. Going back to 
the night he had found her, lingering slowly over all 
the years that had fallen between, and coming to his 
resolve that he would wait until she had seen more of 
life, of men, that she might be the surer of her own 
heart, the resolve prudence dictated, and love had 
failed to keep. Yet there were other thoughts that 
required consideration. He was so much older. True, 
he gave her his heart's first and only love ; but if it 
lacked any freshness that she would miss in days to 
come, any fervor of youth that she might long for, 
Heaven only knew how sorely it would pain him to feel 



 

that he had over-persuaded her in his selfish love. So 
she must ponder it well. And then he said, 

" Can my darling have perfect faith in me believe 
me, trust me? There are dark pages in my past, I 
know a burden laid upon me by another hand ; but 
turning those leaves, I purpose to begin a new life. 
Nay, it was begun long ago, and needs but the seal of 
her love and trust to make it blessed and perfect. Can 
she give me so much? My heart, my daily thoughts, 
are all hers. Shall we begin here the life that is to be 
completed before God and the angels ? " 

There was much more. At the conclusion he decided 
this brief separation was wise for both. In the mean 
while she must study her own heart, and rest forever 
assured, whichever way she felt impelled to act, that her 
happiness was his first wish. 

I think any woman would have been moved by the 
tender love. When it was quite dark, Hope leaned her 
face against the window casing and wept softly why, 
she could hardly have told. Is there an undertone of 
sadness in a great joy? For she was very, very happy. 

Presently she remembered Joe, and groped her way 
out to the hall. Hope was always generous with her 
pleasures. She wanted some one to share every delight, 
and since there was no longer a doubt as to their love, 
she must make Joe glad in her joy. Poor Joe did 
she ever have a lover ? Not like Stephen no one 



 

could be so grand and sweet ; but some one who had 
held her in his arms, and kissed her. 

She opened the door and entered quietly. Joe sat in 
an arm-chair on one side of the fire. How still and 
sacred the roam was ! just the time and place for such a 
confidence. 

Hope knelt down and clasped Joe's hand in both of 
hers. It was large and red ; no amount of care ever 
made it soft and white. She caressed it tenderly ; then, 
burying her face in Joe's lap, she murmured with a 
tremulousness that sounded not unlike sobs, 

w O, Joe, he loves me, he loves me ! " 

Joe started, and sat upright. " Not Stephen ! " she 
exclaimed in a quick, sharp tone. 

" Yes, Stephen. Why not ? I am not good enough 
for him, but then no one is. And I can give him 
youth, and beauty, and love. I can make him happy." 

For a moment Joe's brain whirled in helpless terror. 
The blow had come, and she was not prepared. We 
may think over an emergency, and fancy ourselves 
strong ; but we cannot be sure until the test, like a gal- 
vanic shock, is applied to the unknown weak spot, and 
the whole body reels and quivers. 

"What is it? O, Joe!" and Hope started at the 
dilating eyes and ashen face. 

" You can't marry him ! " she gasped. " God's curse 
would be on it. He had no right to your love he 
knows it." 



 

"He has every -right." Hope sprang up and poised 
her golden-crowned head with lofty pride. "Did he not 
take me to his heart and home when I was an outcast? 
Think of the happy years he has showered upon me ! 
And shall I make him no return? O, Joe, you are 
wild, indeed ! He has done everything for me, and I 
am proud to-night to feel that I love him and he 
deserves it." 

I do not know that I can make you understand 
Josephine Dane. She was not purely vindictive ; she 
took no delight in thwarting Stephen or Hope. Only 
now that the fiery trial had come, the fierce flames 
proved too much for her. Stephen's sin brought him 
nearer her level, and she felt she would rather go on 
always in this fashion than have him so completely 
engrossed by another. She loved him, too. She had 
suffered for him. What did this child know ? Besides, 
the whole world was Hope's to choose from, and she had 
only Stephen. Just as you have sometimes seen a dull, 
smouldering fire blaze out, so the woman's nature burst 
its ordinary bonds. 

"Yes," she said hoarsely, " he did everything because 
he knew whose hand brought you where you were. He 
owed you something, Hope Vennard ! Your loss was 
his gain, and now he seeks to make it up in this fashion. 
God will not let him, I tell you. It is Stephen who is 
wild ! " 

A horrible fear flashed over Hope. The room spun 



 

round, and lightning sparks danced before her eyes. 
The debt Stephen owed, the sin he had committed, the 
mystery concerning her father's death, and the strict 
charge Joe had given her, so long ago, never to mention 
it his secret, that could not be confessed to her 

" Joe," Hope knelt at her feet and clasped her hands 
again, "I must hear it now. If you have any pity, 
tell me the truth. What does Stephen know of my 
father's death?" 

"All," Joe responded, with a fierce, sullen despera- 
tion. 

" O, no, not all; " and Hope's voice was hysterical. 
" Why, think a little, Joe ; it was murder ! Would 
Stephen witness such a deed, and let the miscreant go 
unpunished? No, you are mistaken." 

"Life was sweet to him," Joe said, looking into the 
fire. 

" O, Joe ! " It was the wail of a heart rent asunder. 
And then there was an awful, deathly silence. 

Presently Hope rose. Her face was icily white and 
cold. A blue line for the rosy lips Stephen had kissed 
last night. Her whole figure took on a rigidness as if 
she had been frozen. 

" Joe," her voice was strangely hollow, "I want 
you to tell me the whole truth. I promised to trust 
him, and it is basely wicked to break my word ; but the 
silence, and waiting, will kill me. God knows I forgive 
him. I think he has suffered bitterly, and repented 



 

deeply for any evil moment of passionate anger. 
Begin." 

"I can't." Joe writhed in sickly fear. 

"You shall, Josephine Dane. Either this, or take 
back the charge you have made, and let me have 
Stephen, my own love, once again." 

She transfixed Joe with her resolute eye. As if 
under the influence of some strange spell, she told all 
she knew. Her sincerity impressed Hope powerfully. 
And yet no sound escaped her lips as the story ended. 
She was stunned. 

" You couldn't marry him?" Joe said. 

" No, O, no ! Poor Stephen. Joe, did you ever 
hate him?" 

"No; I told you I loved him. And if he was in a 
prison cell, I would find my way to him. No crime 
could ever taint him in my eyes. And so, I love him 
better than you." 

" O," she moaned, M it is so hard ! so cruel ! Why 
did God let him ! God is so strong, you know, and has 
promised to help us in the hour of temptation. Why 
didn't he cry to Him ! You are sure, Joe ! You didn't 
dream this wild, horrible thing ! " 

Joe Dane had never told a wilful lie in her whole life. 
It angered her to be doubted or disbelieved. In her 
way she felt fully as miserable as Hope. All the ache 
and agony she had borne for years, all the pangs of 
silent endurance, the coldly treated love, the hope 



 

trampled in the dust, a pale corse despoiled of its 
beauty, the wasted youth and the irrepressible longing, 
joining in one mighty throe, burst the bonds of the slow- 
travailing soul asunder. She sprang up, and leaned her 
elbow on the low marble mantel, to steady herself. 

" Do you suppose I liked to believe such a thing of the 
man / loved ? Do you think it was nothing to have 
this terrible secret weighing upon me, and yet bear it 
gladly for his sake? I am not beautiful, like you; I 
can't take on the gfaces that make you so winsome ; I 
haven't your soft voice, nor your sweet eyes. But I am 
a woman, and can love." 

" Poor Joe ! " Hope came up to her, and laid her 
trembling hand on the broad shoulder. "Yes, you have 
suffered the most, and you have the best right to him. 
There'll be one blessed night for me to remember. And 
when I am gone, you and Stephen will settle into your 
old ways, growing tenderer to each other. No one will 
ever come between you again, for his heart is all yours, 
save the little corner I crept into. Don't turn me quite 
out, Joe. For I shall like to think of you both when 
I am away, and cannot see you ; " and Hope's quivering 
voice broke down. 

" Going away ? " Joe exclaimed, in a dazed, wondering 
manner. " Where can you go ? " 

" I must ; I must. Think if it had been your father 
and the man you loved ! You couldn't take his poor 
hand, knowing the stain there was upon it ; and you 



 

would rather go away and break your own heart, than 
stay and wound his by coldness. And I think it would 
pain him terribly to know we had talked this over." 

"O!" and Joe wrung her hands. "What have 
I done? Why did you make me tell the story, 
Hope?" 

" It is all right and best. What if I had learned it 
after I was his wife ; " and she shuddered. " But 
if I could stay, we might betray our secret. I haven't 
your reticence. Some time, when he questioned me 
closely, I should be compelled to tell him. I forgive 
him now. Poor Stephen ! It has been a hard burden 
for him to carry. But" and her voice faltered, 
"I don't know how I could see him again." 

" I ought not to have told you ! " Joe was struck 
with a latent remorse. In this tangled path she had 
lost her way. 

"No; as I said, it is all right. It won't kill me 
now, for I am young and strong ; and I think God 
meant that I should know it just at this time. 
He wasn't quite sure' that it would be wisest for 
us to marry. I can answer him now, without any 
difficulty." 

The sad, patient face and dreary voice smote Joe 
bitterly. Yet jealous love and a certain rugged feel- 
ing of right upheld her. 

They stood there, looking at each other in dumb 
anguish, for the sake of the man they both loved. Fate 



 

ties hard and troublesome knots in her webs now and 
then. 

" You see it will be best for me to go." 

" But where ? There's Mr. Adams " 

"No, not there." Another shiver came over Hope. 
"It must be quite among strangers, and where he will 
not find me. A little while ago, Joe, I could have gone 
away with an Opera Troupe ; a gentleman liked my 
vqjce so very much. So I can sing and teach music. 
Stephen has made me able to take care of myself. I 
can't tell now what I shall do but something. God 
will help me." 

" Hope," Joe said, much moved, " when Stephen 
returns it will be like the brothers going back without 
Benjamin. How shall I meet him ? He will hate and 
despise me for what I have done. Yet I think he was 
wrong. I can't seem to make it fair to my mind. It's 
like seething a kid in its mother's milk." 

Yes." Hope's pale lips quivered. " We'll talk of it 
to-morrow. Good night, Joe. I feel tired sick." 

" Good night ; " and the two women kissed each other. 

Then Hope crept off up stairs. It seemed at first as 
if her feet would refuse to carry her. She did not even 
get a light, but in the darkness and silence found her 
way into bed, and lay there shivering and exhausted. 
It had been such a great blow. To lose confidence in 
Stephen, to think of the fearful crime he had committed 
for that paltry sum of money ! And how he had grown 



 

rich She wanted to believe it an accident, but her 
whole nature seemed to revolt against this, much as she 
loved and pitied Stephen. And that he could have 
taken her to his heart ! 

She did not sleep at all. Nearly all night she lay 
with her eyes wide open. After midnight the moon 
came up and flooded the room with its cold, pale light. 
Sometimes a fiery flash of fever tortured, her, then a 
chill, that nearly froze the blood in her veins. It 
seemed to her she lived ages in that one night. 

Joe sat by the fire. In her confused and wandering 
way she was trying to unravel the tangled web, and see 
who was right. Just now she loved Stephen with a 
sort of tigerish fierceness. To see another woman his, 
to have him lavish caresses upon her, to be put aside 
completely, was what she could not endure. Pity her, 
too. Life is so hard to some of us, and love is cruel. 

Two very strange days passed over them. They 
made talk of common occurrences ; they went through 
with their ordinary duties ; but one subject was not 
touched upon. They avoided each other's eyes, and 
somehow both came to have a guilty feeling, as if they 
were about some crime. 

On the third day Hope did not go to school as usual. 
At ten, after spending an hour in her room, she came 
down in her thick gray dress. There was a stony, 
settled expression in her face, a sinking of the lines 
about the mouth, and a dark shade under the eyes. 
Even her voice had changed. 




 

" Joe," she began, with a hollow, tremulous sound, 
"are you well enough to go out for a walk? It's a 
lovely day." 

It was bright and sunny. 

" I could." Joe glanced up wistfully. Why ? " 

"Don't ask me any questions, please. It is best for 
you not to know anything. Don't tell Stephen of our 
talk. Comfort him all you can, and make him forget 
me. And now put on your bonnet and go out for an 
hour. Just let me kiss you once. You have been so 
kind to me ! I want you to forgive me for all the pain 
and suffering I've cause'd you. I know now what it is." 

But the kiss ended in sobs. Since that fatal night 
Hope had been too deeply stunned for tears. They 
both wept. 

"O, Hope," Joe's voice was broken and repentant, 
" stay. Don't go. I'll give up all claim on Stephen. 
He may love you ; he may devote his whole life to you, 
and I'll look on, never saying a word. Only stay." 

"It isn't that, Joe. It's the insurmountable barrier 
God placed between us. I should make Stephen mis- 
erable if I staid." 

"But what will you do? " 

w It is best you should not know. At present I am 
provided for. I shall never do anything for which you 
or Stephen would be sorry. I cannot tell you more 
than that. Now you must go." 

Joe gave her a wild, beseeching look. Hope was the 



 

stronger. She brought Joe's shawl and bonnet, wrapped 
her with tender care, led her through the hall, and gave 
her one convulsive kiss. When the door closed, Hope 
groped her way back as if she had been blind. For a 
moment the whole sacrifice appeared useless. And then 
the room seemed to run with seas of crimson blood. 
A sick shudder crept over her. 

Presently, a hackman drove up to the door. Katy 
came in wide-eyed wonder. 

"You're not goin' away, Miss Hope?" 

"Yes. I want you to give this to Miss Joe, and this 
to Mr. Dane when he comes home," and she handed 
her a little packet. 

"You'm not goin' to 'lope?" and Katy started in 
affright. 

The man had brought down her trunk. She gave 
Katy's black hand a fond, lingering squeeze, uttered a 
broken good-by, and before Katy could recover herself, 
the hack dashed away. She went back to the kitchen, 
talking out her astonishment with herself. 

On Joe's return, she brought the two notes ; but Joe 
was in no condition to talk. Now that the step had 
been taken, a wild consternation filled every pulse. She 
looked helplessly at Katy ; she stretched out her hands 
in a strange terror ; the whole world seemed drifting 
away. She tried to call on Hope, on Stephen, but her 
tongue was paralyzed. And then came darkness, 
peace. 



 

Stephen's business being ended sooner than he ex- 
pected, he hurried home, eager to see Hope, his brain 
filled with delicious visions. He found Joe in the 
stupor of fever, quite unconscious, and a note from 
Hope that gave him a shock half depriving him of his 
faculties. He had found Joe's also, and read it. Hope 
had worded it so carefully that no one could have 
suspected Joe of being aware of her intentions. 

To Stephen she said she had been studying her own 
heart, and found that becoming his wife was an impossi- 
bility. She was sorry for having misled him, but she 
had not then known her true feelings. She begged him 
to forget her she was not worth his remembrance. 
He had performed a more than friend's duty towards 
her, and she implored him to believe her grateful. It 
would be useless to search for her, she said, as, if he 
found her, a return would be quite out of the question. 
The whole tone of the note was curt and cold. It 
pained Stephen cruelly. That to Joe was so tender ! 

Poor Hope ! Her heart had well nigh broken over 
them both. If she had said to Stephen half of what she 
longed to, she could never have gone away. In her rare 
delicacy she could not humiliate him by even hinting at 
his secret. And so she had guarded every word, been
