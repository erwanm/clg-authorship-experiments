in undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang
under forest trees. The country about was the perfection of cultivated
landscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary
date, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft
bloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.

It needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise. One
riding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl swinging
in the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old poetry
or the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic. He
could not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of
reports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere.

Ruth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her
had been as unsubstantial as a dream. Perhaps she so thought it.

“I feel,” she once said to her father, “as if I were living in a house
of cards.”

“And thee would like to turn it into a hospital?”

“No. But tell me father,” continued Ruth, not to be put off, “is thee
still going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and
entice thee?”

Mr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about “business”.
“Such men have their uses, Ruth. They keep the world active, and I owe a
great many of my best operations to such men. Who knows, Ruth, but this
new land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler
in, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?”

“Ah, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light. I do believe
thee wouldn’t have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,
if it hadn’t had the novelty of an experiment to thee.”

“And is thee satisfied with it?”

“If thee means, if I have had enough of it, no. I just begin to see what
I can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman. Would
thee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to
come and put me in a cage?”

Mr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and
he did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that
very day which was entirely characteristic of him.

Ruth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of
cards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils
that hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America
have of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity
and luxury hang.

A sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be
forthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures,
from no one of which a dollar could be realized. It was in vain that he
applied to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period
of sudden panic and no money. “A hundred thousand! Mr. Bolton,” said
Plumly. “Good God, if you should ask me for ten, I shouldn’t know where
to get it.”

And yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.
Bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could
not raise ten thousand dollars. Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.
Without it he was a beggar. Mr. Bolton had already Small’s notes for a
large amount in his safe, labeled “doubtful;” he had helped him again
and again, and always with the same result. But Mr. Small spoke with a
faltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant
of his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton
put by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping
together, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar,
who had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.

Beautiful credit! The foundation of modern society. Who shall say that
this is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon
human promises? That is a peculiar condition of society which enables
a whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar
newspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished
speculator in lands and mines this remark:--“I wasn’t worth a cent two
years ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.”

CHAPTER XXVII.

It was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling
enterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been
such refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out. It was hard to come
down to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent
and the most conspicuous man in the community. It was sad to see his
name disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected
at intervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and
clothed on with rhetorical tar and feathers.

But his friends suffered more on his account than he did. He was a cork
that could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.

He had to bolster up his wife’s spirits every now and then. On one of
these occasions he said:

“It’s all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little
while. There’s $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:
Harry seems to be having some difficulty, but that’s to be expected--you
can’t move these big operations to the tune of Fisher’s Hornpipe, you
know. But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you’ll
see! I expect the news every day now.”

“But Beriah, you’ve been expecting it every day, all along, haven’t
you?”

“Well, yes; yes--I don’t know but I have. But anyway, the longer it’s
delayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start--same as
every day you live brings you nearer to--nearer--”

“The grave?”

“Well, no--not that exactly; but you can’t understand these things,
Polly dear--women haven’t much head for business, you know. You make
yourself perfectly comfortable, old lady, and you’ll see how we’ll trot
this right along. Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants
to--that’s no great matter--there’s a bigger thing than that.”

“Bigger than $200,000, Beriah?”

“Bigger, child?--why, what’s $200,000? Pocket money! Mere pocket money!
Look at the railroad! Did you forget the railroad? It ain’t many months
till spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad swimming
right along behind it. Where’ll it be by the middle of summer? Just stop
and fancy a moment--just think a little--don’t anything suggest itself?
Bless your heart, you dear women live right in the present all the
time--but a man, why a man lives----

“In the future, Beriah? But don’t we live in the future most too much,
Beriah? We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year’s crop of corn
and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,
but sometimes it’s not a robust diet,--Beriah. But don’t look that
way, dear--don’t mind what I say. I don’t mean to fret, I don’t mean to
worry; and I don’t, once a month, do I, dear? But when I get a little
low and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don’t mean
anything in the world. It passes right away. I know you’re doing all
you can, and I don’t want to seem repining and ungrateful--for I’m not,
Beriah--you know I’m not, don’t you?”

“Lord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that
ever lived--that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth! And I know
that I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and
scheme for you with all my might. And I’ll bring things all right yet,
honey--cheer up and don’t you fear. The railroad----”

“Oh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a
body forgets everything. Yes, the railroad--tell me about the railroad.”

“Aha, my girl, don’t you see? Things ain’t so dark, are they? Now I
didn’t forget the railroad. Now just think for a moment--just figure up
a little on the future dead moral certainties. For instance, call this
waiter St. Louis.

“And we’ll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to
this potato, which is Slouchburg:

“Then with this carving knife we’ll continue the railroad from
Slouchburg to Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:

“Then we run along the--yes--the comb--to the tumbler that’s Brimstone:

“Thence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is the salt-cellar:

“Thence to, to--that quill--Catfish--hand me the pincushion, Marie
Antoinette:

“Thence right along these shears to this horse, Babylon:

“Then by the spoon to Bloody Run--thank you, the ink:

“Thence to Hail Columbia--snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and
saucer close up, that’s Hail Columbia:

“Then--let me open my knife--to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we’ll put
the candle-stick--only a little distance from Hail Columbia to
Hark-from-the-Tomb--down-grade all the way.

“And there we strike Columbus River--pass me two or three skeins of
thread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and
the rat trap for Stone’s Landing--Napoleon, I mean--and you can see how
much better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye. Now here you are with your
railroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and thence
to Corruptionville.

“Now then--there you are! It’s a beautiful road, beautiful. Jeff
Thompson can out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through
an aneroid, or a theodolite, or whatever they call it--he calls it
sometimes one and sometimes the other just whichever levels off his
sentence neatest, I reckon. But ain’t it a ripping road, though? I tell
you, it’ll make a stir when it gets along. Just see what a country it
goes through. There’s your onions at Slouchburg--noblest onion country
that graces God’s footstool; and there’s your turnip country all around
Doodleville--bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there
when they get that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of
turnips--if there’s any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress
has made an appropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn’t
have done that just on conjecture, of course. And now we come to the
Brimstone region--cattle raised there till you can’t rest--and corn, and
all that sort of thing. Then you’ve got a little stretch along through
Belshazzar that don’t produce anything now--at least nothing but
rocks--but irrigation will fetch it. Then from Catfish to Babylon it’s
a little swampy, but there’s dead loads of peat down under there
somewhere. Next is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country--tobacco
enough can be raised there to support two such railroads. Next is the
sassparilla region. I reckon there’s enough of that truck along in there
on the line of the pocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the
Tomb to fat up all the consumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax
to the Holy Land. It just grows like weeds! I’ve got a little belt of
sassparilla land in there just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my
little Universal Expectorant to get into shape in my head. And I’ll fix
that, you know. One of these days I’ll have all the nations of the earth
expecto--”

“But Beriah, dear--”

“Don’t interrupt me; Polly--I don’t want you to lose the run of the
map--well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have
it--and run along with you. Here, now--the soap will do for Babylon.
Let me see--where was I? Oh yes--now we run down to Stone’s
Lan--Napoleon--now we run down to Napoleon. Beautiful road. Look at
that, now. Perfectly straight line-straight as the way to the grave.

And see where it leaves Hawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear
out in the cold. That town’s as bound to die as--well if I owned it I’d
get its obituary ready, now, and notify the mourners. Polly, mark my
words--in three years from this, Hawkeye’ll be a howling wilderness.
You’ll see. And just look at that river--noblest stream that meanders
over the thirsty earth!--calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her
weary bosom! Railroad goes all over it and all through it--wades right
along on stilts. Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half--forty-nine
bridges from Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone’s Landing altogether--forty
nine bridges, and culverts enough to culvert creation itself!
Hadn’t skeins of thread enough to represent them all--but you get
an idea--perfect trestle-work of bridges for seventy two miles: Jeff
Thompson and I fixed all that, you know; he’s to get the contracts and
I’m to put them through on the divide. Just oceans of money in those
bridges. It’s the only part of the railroad I’m interested in,--down
along the line--and it’s all I want, too. It’s enough, I should judge.
Now here we are at Napoleon. Good enough country plenty good enough--all
it wants is population. That’s all right--that will come. And it’s
no bad country now for calmness and solitude, I can tell you--though
there’s no money in that, of course. No money, but a man wants rest, a
man wants peace--a man don’t want to rip and tear around all the time.
And here we go, now, just as straight as a string for Hallelujah--it’s a
beautiful angle--handsome up grade all the way--and then away you go to
Corruptionville, the gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers
that ever--good missionary field, too. There ain’t such another
missionary field outside the jungles of Central Africa. And
patriotic?--why they named it after Congress itself. Oh, I warn you, my
dear, there’s a good time coming, and it’ll be right along before you
know what you’re about, too. That railroad’s fetching it. You see what
it is as far as I’ve got, and if I had enough bottles and soap and
boot-jacks and such things to carry it along to where it joins onto the
Union Pacific, fourteen hundred miles from here, I should exhibit to
you in that little internal improvement a spectacle of inconceivable
sublimity. So, don’t you see? We’ve got the rail road to fall back
on; and in the meantime, what are we worrying about that $200,000
appropriation for? That’s all right. I’d be willing to bet anything that
the very next letter that comes from Harry will--”

The eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter,
warm from the post-office.

“Things do look bright, after all, Beriah. I’m sorry I was blue, but it
did seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages. Open
the letter--open it quick, and let’s know all about it before we stir
out of our places. I am all in a fidget to know what it says.”

The letter was opened, without any unnecessary delay.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Whatever may have been the language of Harry’s letter to the Colonel,
the information it conveyed was condensed or expanded, one or the other,
from the following episode of his visit to New York:

He called, with official importance in his mien, at No.-- Wall street,
where a great gilt sign betokened the presence of the head-quarters of
the “Columbus River Slack-Water Navigation Company.” He entered and gave
a dressy porter his card, and was requested to wait a moment in a sort
of ante-room. The porter returned in a minute; and asked whom he would
like to see?

“The president of the company, of course.”

“He is busy with some gentlemen, sir; says he will be done with them
directly.”

That a copper-plate card with “Engineer-in-Chief” on it should be
received with such tranquility as this, annoyed Mr. Brierly not a
little. But he had to submit. Indeed his annoyance had time to augment a
good deal; for he was allowed to cool his heels a full half hour in the
ante-room before those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the
presence. He found a stately dignitary occupying a very official
chair behind a long green morocco-covered table, in a room sumptuously
carpeted and furnished, and well garnished with pictures.

“Good morning, sir; take a seat--take a seat.”

“Thank you sir,” said Harry, throwing as much chill into his manner as
his ruffled dignity prompted.

“We perceive by your reports and the reports of the Chief
Superintendent, that you have been making gratifying progress with the
work.--We are all very much pleased.”

“Indeed? We did not discover it from your letters--which we have not
received; nor by the treatment our drafts have met with--which were not
honored; nor by the reception of any part of the appropriation, no part
of it having come to hand.”

“Why, my dear Mr. Brierly, there must be some mistake, I am sure we
wrote you and also Mr. Sellers, recently--when my clerk comes he will
show copies--letters informing you of the ten per cent. assessment.”

“Oh, certainly, we got those letters. But what we wanted was money to
carry on the work--money to pay the men.”

“Certainly, certainly--true enough--but we credited you both for a large
part of your assessments--I am sure that was in our letters.”

“Of course that was in--I remember that.”

“Ah, very well then. Now we begin to understand each other.”

“Well, I don’t see that we do. There’s two months’ wages due the men,
and----”

“How? Haven’t you paid the men?”

“Paid them! How are we going to pay them when you don’t honor our
drafts?”

“Why, my dear sir, I cannot see how you can find any fault with us. I
am sure we have acted in a perfectly straight forward business way.--Now
let us look at the thing a moment. You subscribed for 100 shares of the
capital stock, at $1,000 a share, I believe?”

“Yes, sir, I did.”

“And Mr. Sellers took a like amount?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Very well. No concern can get along without money. We levied a ten per
cent. assessment. It was the original understanding that you and Mr.
Sellers were to have the positions you now hold, with salaries of $600
a month each, while in active service. You were duly elected to these
places, and you accepted them. Am I right?”

“Certainly.”

“Very well. You were given your instructions and put to work. By your
reports it appears that you have expended the sum of $9,610 upon the
said work. Two months salary to you two officers amounts altogether
to $2,400--about one-eighth of your ten per cent. assessment, you see;
which leaves you in debt to the company for the other seven-eighths
of the assessment--viz, something over $8,000 apiece. Now instead of
requiring you to forward this aggregate of $16,000 or $17,000 to New
York, the company voted unanimously to let you pay it over to the
contractors, laborers from time to time, and give you credit on the
books for it. And they did it without a murmur, too, for they were
pleased with the progress you had made, and were glad to pay you that
little compliment--and a very neat one it was, too, I am sure. The
work you did fell short of $10,000, a trifle. Let me see--$9,640 from
$20,000--salary $2,400 added--ah yes, the balance due the company from
yourself and Mr. Sellers is $7,960, which I will take the responsibility
of allowing to stand for the present, unless you prefer to draw a check
now, and thus----”

“Confound it, do you mean to say that instead of the company owing us
$2,400, we owe the company $7,960?”

“Well, yes.”

“And that we owe the men and the contractors nearly ten thousand dollars
besides?”

“Owe them! Oh bless my soul, you can’t mean that you have not paid these
people?”

“But I do mean it!”

The president rose and walked the floor like a man in bodily pain. His
brows contracted, he put his hand up and clasped his forehead, and kept
saying, “Oh, it is, too bad, too bad, too bad! Oh, it is bound to be
found out--nothing can prevent it--nothing!”

Then he threw himself into his chair and said:

“My dear Mr. Brierson, this is dreadful--perfectly dreadful. It will
be found out. It is bound to tarnish the good name of the company; our
credit will be seriously, most seriously impaired. How could you be so
thoughtless--the men ought to have been paid though it beggared us all!”

“They ought, ought they? Then why the devil--my name is not Bryerson, by
the way--why the mischief didn’t the compa--why what in the nation
ever became of the appropriation? Where is that appropriation?--if a
stockholder may make so bold as to ask.”

“The appropriation?--that paltry $200,000, do you mean?”

“Of course--but I didn’t know that $200,000 was so very paltry. Though
I grant, of course, that it is not a large sum, strictly speaking. But
where is it?”

“My dear sir, you surprise me. You surely cannot have had a large
acquaintance with this sort of thing. Otherwise you would not have
expected much of a result from a mere INITIAL appropriation like that.
It was never intended for anything but a mere nest egg for the future
and real appropriations to cluster around.”

“Indeed? Well, was it a myth, or was it a reality? Whatever become of
it?”

“Why the--matter is simple enough. A Congressional appropriation costs
money. Just reflect, for instance--a majority of the House Committee,
say $10,000 apiece--$40,000; a majority of the Senate Committee, the
same each--say $40,000; a little extra to one or two chairman of one or
two such committees, say $10,000 each--$20,000; and there’s $100,000
of the money gone, to begin with. Then, seven male lobbyists, at $3,000
each--$21,000; one female lobbyist, $10,000; a high moral Congressman
or Senator here and there--the high moral ones cost more, because they.
give tone to a measure--say ten of these at $3,000 each, is $30,000;
then a lot of small-fry country members who won’t vote for anything
whatever without pay--say twenty at $500 apiece, is $10,000; a lot
of dinners to members--say $10,000 altogether; lot of jimcracks for
Congressmen’s wives and children--those go a long way--you can’t spend
too much money in that line--well, those things cost in a lump,
say $10,000--along there somewhere; and then comes your printed
documents--your maps, your tinted engravings, your pamphlets, your
illuminated show cards, your advertisements in a hundred and fifty
papers at ever so much a line--because you’ve got to keep the papers all
right or you are gone up, you know. Oh, my dear sir, printing bills
are destruction itself. Ours so far amount to--let me see--10; 52; 22;
13;--and then there’s 11; 14; 33--well, never mind the details, the
total in clean numbers foots up $118,254.42 thus far!”

“What!”

“Oh, yes indeed. Printing’s no bagatelle, I can tell you. And then
there’s your contributions, as a company, to Chicago fires and Boston
fires, and orphan asylums and all that sort of thing--head the list,
you see, with the company’s full name and a thousand dollars set
opposite--great card, sir--one of the finest advertisements in the
world--the preachers mention it in the pulpit when it’s a religious
charity--one of the happiest advertisements in the world is your
benevolent donation. Ours have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and
some cents up to this time.”

“Good heavens!”

“Oh, yes. Perhaps the biggest thing we’ve done in the advertising line
was to get an officer of the U. S. government, of perfectly Himmalayan
official altitude, to write up our little internal improvement for a
religious paper of enormous circulation--I tell you that makes our bonds
go handsomely among the pious poor. Your religious paper is by far
the best vehicle for a thing of this kind, because they’ll ‘lead’ your
article and put it right in the midst of the reading matter; and if it’s
got a few Scripture quotations in it, and some temperance platitudes
and a bit of gush here and there about Sunday Schools, and a sentimental
snuffle now and then about ‘God’s precious ones, the honest hard-handed
poor,’ it works the nation like a charm, my dear sir, and never a man
suspects that it is an advertisement; but your secular paper sticks you
right into the advertising columns and of course you don’t take a trick.
Give me a religious paper to advertise in, every time; and if you’ll
just look at their advertising pages, you’ll observe that other people
think a good deal as I do--especially people who have got little
financial schemes to make everybody rich with. Of course I mean your
great big metropolitan religious papers that know how to serve God and
make money at the same time--that’s your sort, sir, that’s your sort--a
religious paper that isn’t run to make money is no use to us, sir, as an
advertising medium--no use to anybody--in our line of business. I guess
our next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters
out to Napoleon. Never paid them a cent; just filled them up with
champagne and the fat of the land, put pen, ink and paper before them
while they were red-hot, and bless your soul when you come to read their
letters you’d have supposed they’d been to heaven. And if a sentimental
squeamishness held one or two of them back from taking a less rosy view
of Napoleon, our hospitalities tied his tongue, at least, and he said
nothing at all and so did us no harm. Let me see--have I stated all
the expenses I’ve been at? No, I was near forgetting one or two items.
There’s your official salaries--you can’t get good men for nothing.
Salaries cost pretty lively. And then there’s your big
high-sounding millionaire names stuck into your advertisements as
stockholders--another card, that--and they are stockholders, too, but
you have to give them the stock and non-assessable at that--so they’re
an expensive lot. Very, very expensive thing, take it all around, is
a big internal improvement concern--but you see that yourself, Mr.
Bryerman--you see that, yourself, sir.”

“But look here. I think you are a little mistaken about it’s ever having
cost anything for Congressional votes. I happen to know something about
that. I’ve let you say your say--now let me say mine. I don’t wish to
seem to throw any suspicion on anybody’s statements, because we are all
liable to be mistaken. But how would it strike you if I were to say that
I was in Washington all the time this bill was pending? and what if I
added that I put the measure through myself? Yes, sir, I did that little
thing. And moreover, I never paid a dollar for any man’s vote and never
promised one. There are some ways of doing a thing that are as good as
others which other people don’t happen to think about, or don’t have the
knack of succeeding in, if they do happen to think of them. My dear sir,
I am obliged to knock some of your expenses in the head--for never a
cent was paid a Congressman or Senator on the part of this Navigation
Company.”

The president smiled blandly, even sweetly, all through this harangue,
and then said:

“Is that so?”

“Every word of it.”

“Well it does seem to alter the complexion of things a little. You are
acquainted with the members down there, of course, else you could not
have worked to such advantage?”

“I know them all, sir. I know their wives, their children, their
babies--I even made it a point to be on good terms with their lackeys. I
know every Congressman well--even familiarly.”

“Very good. Do you know any of their signatures? Do you know their
handwriting?”

“Why I know their handwriting as well as I know my own--have
had correspondence enough with them, I should think. And their
signatures--why I can tell their initials, even.”

The president went to a private safe, unlocked it and got out some
letters and certain slips of paper. Then he said:

“Now here, for instance; do you believe that that is a genuine letter?
Do you know this signature here?--and this one? Do you know who those
initials represent--and are they forgeries?”

Harry was stupefied. There were things there that made his brain swim.
Presently, at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that
restored his equilibrium; it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his
face.

The president said:

“That one amuses you. You never suspected him?”

“Of course I ought to have suspected him, but I don’t believe it ever
really occurred to me. Well, well, well--how did you ever have the nerve
to approach him, of all others?”

“Why my friend, we never think of accomplishing anything without his
help. He is our mainstay. But how do those letters strike you?”

“They strike me dumb! What a stone-blind idiot I have been!”

“Well, take it all around, I suppose you had a pleasant time in
Washington,” said the president, gathering up the letters; “of course
you must have had. Very few men could go there and get a money bill
through without buying a single--”

“Come, now, Mr. President, that’s plenty of that! I take back everything
I said on that head. I’m a wiser man to-day than I was yesterday, I can
tell you.”

“I think you are. In fact I am satisfied you are. But now I showed you
these things in confidence, you understand. Mention facts as much as
you want to, but don’t mention names to anybody. I can depend on you for
that, can’t I?”

“Oh, of course. I understand the necessity of that. I will not betray
the names. But to go back a bit, it begins to look as if you never saw
any of that appropriation at all?”

“We saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it--and that was all. Several
of us took turns at log-rolling in Washington, and if we had charged
anything for that service, none of that $10,000 would ever have reached
New York.”

“If you hadn’t levied the assessment you would have been in a close
place I judge?”

“Close? Have you figured up the total of the disbursements I told you
of?”

“No, I didn’t think of that.”

“Well, lets see:

Spent in Washington, say, $191,000 Printing, advertising, etc, say
$118,000 Charity, say, $16,000

      Total, $325,000

The money to do that with, comes from-- Appropriation, $200,000

Ten per cent assessment on capital of $1,000,000 $100,000

      Total, $300,000

“Which leaves us in debt some $25,000 at this moment. Salaries of home
officers are still going on; also printing and advertising. Next month
will show a state of things!”

“And then--burst up, I suppose?”

“By no means. Levy another assessment”

“Oh, I see. That’s dismal.”

“By no means.”

“Why isn’t it? What’s the road out?”

“Another appropriation, don’t you see?”

“Bother the appropriations. They cost more than they come to.”

“Not the next one. We’ll call for half a million--get it and go for a
million the very next month.”

“Yes, but the cost of it!”

The president smiled, and patted his secret letters affectionately. He
said:

“All these people are in the next Congress. We shan’t have to pay them
a cent. And what is more, they will work like beavers for us--perhaps it
might be to their advantage.”

Harry reflected profoundly a while. Then he said:

“We send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other
lands. How much cheaper and better it would be if those people could
only come here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head.”

“I perfectly agree with you, Mr. Beverly. Must you go? Well, good
morning. Look in, when you are passing; and whenever I can give you any
information about our affairs and prospects, I shall be glad to do it.”

Harry’s letter was not a long one, but it contained at least the
calamitous figures that came out in the above conversation. The
Colonel found himself in a rather uncomfortable place--no $1,200 salary
forthcoming; and himself held responsible for half of the $9,640 due the
workmen, to say nothing of being in debt to the company to the extent of
nearly $4,000. Polly’s heart was nearly broken; the “blues” returned in
fearful force, and she had to go out of the room to hide the tears that
nothing could keep back now.

There was mourning in another quarter, too, for Louise had a letter.
Washington had refused, at the last moment, to take $40,000 for the
Tennessee Land, and had demanded $150,000! So the trade fell through,
and now Washington was wailing because he had been so foolish. But he
wrote that his man might probably return to the city soon, and then he
meant to sell to him, sure, even if he had to take $10,000. Louise had a
good cry--several of them, indeed--and the family charitably forebore to
make any comments that would increase her grief.

Spring blossomed, summer came, dragged its hot weeks by, and the
Colonel’s spirits rose, day by day, for the railroad was making good
progress. But by and by something happened. Hawkeye had always declined
to subscribe anything toward the railway, imagining that her large
business would be a sufficient compulsory influence; but now Hawkeye was
frightened; and before Col. Sellers knew what he was about, Hawkeye,
in a panic, had rushed to the front and subscribed such a sum that
Napoleon’s attractions suddenly sank into insignificance and the
railroad concluded to follow a comparatively straight coarse instead of
going miles out of its way to build up a metropolis in the muddy desert
of Stone’s Landing.

The thunderbolt fell. After all the Colonel’s deep planning; after all
his brain work and tongue work in drawing public attention to his pet
project and enlisting interest in it; after all his faithful hard toil
with his hands, and running hither and thither on his busy feet; after
all his high hopes and splendid prophecies, the fates had turned their
backs on him at last, and all in a moment his air-castles crumbled to
ruins about him. Hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing,
and down went Stone’s Landing! One by one its meagre parcel of
inhabitants packed up and moved away, as the summer waned and fall
approached. Town lots were no longer salable, traffic ceased, a deadly
lethargy fell upon the place once more, the “Weekly Telegraph” faded
into an early grave, the wary tadpole returned from exile, the bullfrog
resumed his ancient song, the tranquil turtle sunned his back upon bank
and log and drowsed his grateful life away as in the old sweet days of
yore.

CHAPTER XXIX.

Philip Sterling was on his way to Ilium, in the state of Pennsylvania.
Ilium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild land which
Mr. Bolton had commissioned him to examine.

On the last day of the journey as the railway train Philip was on was
leaving a large city, a lady timidly entered the drawing-room car, and
hesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied. Philip saw
from the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was
starting. In a few moments the conductor entered, and without waiting an
explanation, said roughly to the lady,

“Now you can’t sit there. That seat’s taken. Go into the other car.”

“I did not intend to take the seat,” said the lady rising, “I only sat
down a moment till the conductor should come and give me a seat.”

“There aint any. Car’s full. You’ll have to leave.”

“But, sir,” said the lady, appealingly, “I thought--”

“Can’t help what you thought--you must go into the other car.”

“The train is going very fast, let me stand here till we stop.”

“The lady can have my seat,” cried Philip, springing up.

The conductor turned towards Philip, and coolly and deliberately
surveyed him from head to foot, with contempt in every line of his face,
turned his back upon him without a word, and said to the lady,

“Come, I’ve got no time to talk. You must go now.”

The lady, entirely disconcerted by such rudeness, and frightened, moved
towards the door, opened it and stepped out. The train was swinging
along at a rapid rate, jarring from side to side; the step was a long
one between the cars and there was no protecting grating. The lady
attempted it, but lost her balance, in the wind and the motion of the
car, and fell! She would inevitably have gone down under the wheels, if
Philip, who had swiftly followed her, had not caught her arm and drawn
her up. He then assisted her across, found her a seat, received her
bewildered thanks, and returned to his car.

The conductor was still there, taking his tickets, and growling
something about imposition. Philip marched up to him, and burst out
with,

“You are a brute, an infernal brute, to treat a woman that way.”

“Perhaps you’d like to make a fuss about it,” sneered the conductor.

Philip’s reply was a blow, given so suddenly and planted so squarely in
the conductor’s face, that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger, who
was looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute with a
conductor, and against the side of the car.

He recovered himself, reached the bell rope, “Damn you, I’ll learn you,”
 stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen, and then, as the
speed slackened; roared out,

“Get off this train.”

“I shall not get off. I have as much right here as you.”

“We’ll see,” said the conductor, advancing with the brakemen. The
passengers protested, and some of them said to each other, “That’s too
bad,” as they always do in such cases, but none of them offered to take
a hand with Philip. The men seized him, wrenched him from his seat,
dragged him along the aisle, tearing his clothes, thrust him from the
car, and, then flung his carpet-bag, overcoat and umbrella after him.
And the train went on.

The conductor, red in the face and puffing from his exertion, swaggered
through the car, muttering “Puppy, I’ll learn him.” The passengers, when
he had gone, were loud in their indignation, and talked about signing a
protest, but they did nothing more than talk.

The next morning the Hooverville Patriot and Clarion had this “item”:--

SLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD.

“We learn that as the down noon express was leaving H---- yesterday a
lady! (God save the mark) attempted to force herself into the already
full palatial car. Conductor Slum, who is too old a bird to be caught
with chaff, courteously informed her that the car was full, and when
she insisted on remaining, he persuaded her to go into the car where
she belonged. Thereupon a young sprig, from the East, blustered like a
Shanghai rooster, and began to sass the conductor with his chin music.
That gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his
elegant little left-handers, which so astonished him that he began
to feel for his shooter. Whereupon Mr. Slum gently raised the youth,
carried him forth, and set him down just outside the car to cool off.
Whether the young blood has yet made his way out of Bascom’s swamp,
we have not learned. Conductor Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and
efficient officers on the road; but he ain’t trifled with, not much. We
learn that the company have put a new engine on the seven o’clock train,
and newly upholstered the drawing-room car throughout. It spares no
effort for the comfort of the traveling public.”

Philip never had been before in Bascom’s swamp, and there was nothing
inviting in it to detain him. After the train got out of the way he
crawled out of the briars and the mud, and got upon the track. He was
somewhat bruised, but he was too angry to mind that. He plodded along
over the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body. In the scuffle,
his railway check had disappeared, and he grimly wondered, as he noticed
the loss, if the company would permit him to walk over their track if
they should know he hadn’t a ticket.

Philip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little station,
where he could wait for a train, and he had ample time for reflection.
At first he was full of vengeance on the company. He would sue it. He
would make it pay roundly. But then it occurred to him that he did not
know the name of a witness he could summon, and that a personal fight
against a railway corporation was about the most hopeless in the world.
He then thought he would seek out that conductor, lie in wait for him at
some station, and thrash him, or get thrashed himself.

But as he got cooler, that did not seem to him a project worthy of a
gentleman exactly. Was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such
a fellow as that conductor on the letter’s own plane? And when he came
to this point, he began to ask himself, if he had not acted very much
like a fool. He didn’t regret striking the fellow--he hoped he had
left a mark on him. But, after all, was that the best way? Here was he,
Philip Sterling, calling himself a gentleman, in a brawl with a vulgar
conductor, about a woman he had never seen before. Why should he have
put himself in such a ridiculous position? Wasn’t it enough to have
offered the lady his seat, to have rescued her from an accident, perhaps
from death? Suppose he had simply said to the conductor, “Sir, your
conduct is brutal, I shall report you.” The passengers, who saw the
affair, might have joined in a report against the conductor, and he
might really have accomplished something. And, now! Philip looked at his
torn clothes, and thought with disgust of his haste in getting into a
fight with such an autocrat.

At the little station where Philip waited for the next train, he met a
man--who turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood,
and told him his adventure. He was a kindly sort of man, and seemed very
much interested.

“Dum ‘em,” said he, when he had heard the story.

“Do you think any thing can be done, sir?”

“Wal, I guess tain’t no use. I hain’t a mite of doubt of every word you
say. But suin’s no use. The railroad company owns all these people along
here, and the judges on the bench too. Spiled your clothes! Wal, ‘least
said’s soonest mended.’ You haint no chance with the company.”

When next morning, he read the humorous account in the Patriot and
Clarion, he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before
the public in a fight with the railroad company.

Still Philip’s conscience told him that it was his plain duty to carry
the matter into the courts, even with the certainty of defeat. He
confessed that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his
own feelings or conscience in a case where a law of the land had been
violated before his own eyes. He confessed that every citizen’s first
duty in such case is to put aside his own business and devote his time
and his best efforts to seeing that the infraction is promptly punished;
and he knew that no country can be well governed unless its citizens as
a body keep religiously before their minds that they are the guardians
of the law, and that the law officers are only the machinery for its
execution, nothing more. As a finality he was obliged to confess that he
was a bad citizen, and also that the general laxity of the time, and
the absence of a sense of duty toward any part of the community but the
individual himself were ingrained in him, and he was no better than the
rest of the people.
