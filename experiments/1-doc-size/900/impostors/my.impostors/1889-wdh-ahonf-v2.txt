" I 'm perfectly well " 

"And you don't think I'm foolish and wicked for 



  

stopping you here, and talking in this way ? But 
I know you feel as I do ! " 

" Yes, I feel as you do. You are right — right in 
every way — I mustn't keep you — Good-bye." He 
stepped back to bow, but she put her beautiful hand 
out of the window, and when he took it she wrung 
his hand hard. 

"Thank you, thank you ! You are good and you 
are just ! But no one can do anything. It's useless ! " 

The type of irreproachable coachman on the box 
whose respectability had suffered through the 
strange behaviour of his mistress in this inter- 
view, drove quickly off at her signal, and Conrad 
stood a moment looking after the carriage. His 
heart was full of joy ; it leaped ; he thought it 
would burst. As he turned to walk away it 
seemed to him as if he mounted upon the air. The 
trust she had shown him, the praise she had given 
him ; that crush of the hand : he hoped nothing, he 
formed no idea from it, but it all filled him with 
love that cast out the pain and shame he had been 
suffering. He believed that he could never be un- 
happy any more ; the hardness that was in his mind 
toward his father went out of it ; he saw how sorely 
he had tried him ; he grieved that he had done it, 
but the means, the difference of his feeling about the 
cause of their quarrel, he was solemnly glad of that 
since she shared it. He was only sorry for his father. 
"Poor father ! " he said under his breath as he went 
along. He explained to her about his father in his 
reverie, and she pitied his father too. 



  

He was valldiig over toward the West side, aim- 
lessly at first, and then at times with the longing to 
do something to save those mistaken men from 
themselves forming itself into a purpose. "Was not 
that what she meant, when she bewailed her woman's 
helplessness ? She must have wished him to try, 
if he, being a man, could not do something ; or if 
she did not, still he would try, and if she heard of 
it, she would recall what she had said, and would 
be glad he had understood her so. Thinking of 
her pleasure in what he was going to do, he forgot 
almost what it was ; but when he came to a street- 
car track he remembered it, and looked up and 
down to see if there were any turbulent gathering 
of men, whom he might mingle with and help to 
keep from violence. He saw none anywhere ; and 
then suddenly, as if at the same moment, for in his 
exalted mood all events had a dreamdikc simul- 
taneity, he stood at the corner of an avenue, and in 
the middle of it, a little way off, was a street-car, 
and around the car a tumult of shouting, cursing, 
struggling men. The driver was lashing his horses 
forward, and a policeman was at their heads, with 
the conductor, pulling them ; stones, clubs, brick- 
bats hailed upon the car, the horses, the men 
trying to move them. The mob closed upon 
them in a body, and then a patrol-wagon whirled 
up from the other side, and a squad of policemen 
leaped out, and began to club the rioters. Conrad 
could see how they struck them under the rims of 
their hats ; the blows on their skulls sounded as if 



  

they had fallen on stone ; the rioters ran in all 
directions. 

One of the officers rushed up toward the corner 
"vvhere Conrad stood, and then he saw at his side a 
tall old man with a long white beard. He was call- 
ing out at the policeman : " Ah yes ! Glup the 
strikerss — gif it to them ! Why don't you co and 
glup the bresidents that insoalt your lawss, and gick 
your Boart of Arpidration out-of-toors ? Glup the 
strikerss — they cot no friendts ! They cot no money 
to pribe you, to dreat you ! " 

The officer lifted his club, and the old man threw 
his left arm up to shield his head. Conrad recog- 
nised Lindau, and now he saw the empty sleeve 
dangle in the air, over the stump of his wrist. He 
heard a shot in that turmoil beside the car, and 
something seemed to strike him in the breast. He 
was going to say to the policeman, " Don't strike 
him ! He's an old soldier ! You see he has no 
hand !" but he could not speak, he could not move 
his tongue. The policeman stood there ; he saw his 
face : it was not bad, not cruel ; it was like the face 
of a statue, fixed, perdurable ; a mere image of irre- 
sponsible and involuntary authority. Then Conrad 
fell forward, pierced through the heart by that shot 
fired from the car. 

March heard the shot as he scrambled out of his 
car, and at the same moment he saw Lindau drop 
under the club of the policeman, who left him where 
he fell, and joined the rest of the squad in pursuing 
the rioters. The fisrhting round the car in the 



  

avenue ceased ; the driver whipped his horses into a 
gallop, and the place was left empty. 

March would have liked to run ; he thought how 
his wife had implored him to keep away from the 
rioting; but he could not have left Lindau lying 
there if he would. Something stronger than his 
will drew him to the spot, and there he saw Conrad 
dead beside the old man. 



VL 



In the cares which Mrs, March shared with her 
husband that night she was supported partly by 
principle, but mainly by the potent excitement 
which bewildered Conrad's family and took all 
reality from what had happened. It was nearly 
midnight when the Marches left them and walked 
away toward the elevated station with Fulkerson. 
Everything had been done, by tliat time, that could 
be done ; and Fulkerson was not without that satis- 
faction in the business-like despatch of all the details 
which attends each step in such an affair, and helps 
to make death tolerable even to the most sorely 
stricken. We are creatures of the moment ; we 
live from one little space to another ; and only one 
interest at a time fills these. Fulkerson was cheerful 
when they got into the street, almost gay ; and Mrs. 
March experienced a rebound from her depression 
which she felt that she ought not to have experienced. 
But she condoned the offence a little in herself, because 
her husband remained so constant in his gravity ; and 
pending the final accounting he must make her for 
having been where he could be of so much use from 
the first instant of the calamity, she was tenderly, 



  

gratefully proud of all the use he had been to Conrad's 
family, and especially his miserable old father. To 
her mind March was the principal actor in the whole 
affair, and much more important in having seen it 
than those who had suffered in it. In fact, he had 
suffered incomparably. 

'•'Well, well," said Fulkerson. "They'll get 
along now. We 've done all tee could, and there 's 
nothing left but for them to bear it. Of course it 's 
awful, but I guess it 'll come out all right. I mean," 
he added, " they 'll pull through now." 

"I suppose," said March, "that nothing is put 
on us that we can't bear. But I should think," 
he went on musingly, "that when God sees what 
we poor finite creatures can bear, hemmed round 
with this eternal darkness of death, He must respect 
ns." 

" Basil ! " said his wife. But in her heart she 
drew nearer to him for the words she thought she 
ought to rebuke him for. 

" Oh, I know," he said, " we school ourselves to 
despise human nature. But God did not make us 
despicable, and I say whatever end He meant us 
for. He must have some such thrill of joy in our 
adequacy to fate as a father feels when his son 
shows himself a man. When I think what we can 
be if we must, I can't believe the least of us shall 
finally perish." 

"Oh, I reckon the Almighty won't scoop any of 
us," said Fulkerson, with a piety of his own. 

" That poor boy's father ! " sighed Mrs. Man'n. 



  

" I can't get his face out of my sight. He looked so 
much worse than death." 

" Oh, death doesn't look bad," said March. " It 's 
life that looks so in its presence. Death is peace 
and pardon. I only wish poor old Lindau was as 
well out of it as Conrad there." 

"Ah, Lindau ! He has done harm enough," said 
Mrs. March. " I hope he will be careful after this." 

March did not try to defend Lindau against her 
 the ory of the case, which inexorably held him re- 
sponsible for Conrad's death. 

" Lindau 's going to come out all right, I guess," 
said Fulkerson. " He was first-rate when I saw him 
at the hospital to-night." He whispered in March's 
env, at a chance he got in mounting the station 
stairs : " I didn't like to tell you there at the house, 
but I guess you 'd better know. They had to take 
Lindau's arm off near the shoulder. Smashed all to 
pieces by the clubbing." 

In the house, vainly rich and foolishly unfit for 
them, the bereaved family whom the Marches had 
just left lingered together, and tried to get strength 
to part for the night. They were all spent with the 
fatigue that comes from heaven to such misery as 
theirs, and they sat in a torpor in which each waited 
for the other to move, to speak. 

Christine moved, and Mela spoke. Christine rose 
and went out of the room without saying a word, 
and they heard her going upstairs. Then Mela said, 

" I reckon the rest of us better be goun' too, father. 
Here, let 's git mother started." 




She put her arm round licr mother, to lift her 
from her chair, but the old mau did not stir, and 
Mela called Mrs. Mandel from the next room. Be- 
tween them they raised her to her feet. 

"Ain't there anybody a-goin' to set up with it V 
she asked, in her hoarse pipe. " It appears like folks 
hain't got any fcelin's in New York. "Woon't some 
o' the neighbours come and offer to set up, without 
waitin' to be asked V 

" Oh, that 's all right, mother. The men 'll attend 
to that. Don't you bother any," Mela coaxed, and 
she kept her arm round her mother, with tender 
patience. 

" Why, Mely, child ! I can't feel right to have it 
left to hirelin's, so. But there ain't anybody any 
more to see things done as they ought. If Coonrod 
was on'y here " 

"Well, mother, you are pretty mixed!" said 
Mela, with a strong tendency to break into her large 
guffaw. But she checked herself and said, "I know 
just how you feel, though. It keeps a-comun' and 
a-goun' ; and it 's so and it ain't so, all at once ; 
that's the plagiie of it. Well, father! Ain't you 
goun' to come ? ' 

" I 'm goin' to stay, Mela," said the old man gently, 
without moving. "Get your mother to bed, that's 
a good girk" 

"You goin' to set up with him, Jacob ? " asked the 
old woman. 

" Yes, 'Liz'beth, I 'll set up. You go to bed." 

" well, I will, Jacob. And I believe it 'll do you 



  

good to set up. I wished I could set up with you ; 
but I don't seem to have the stren'th I did when the 

twins died. I must git my sleep, so 's to I don't 

like very well to have you broke of your rest, Jacob, 
but there don't appear to be anybody else. You 
wouldn't have to do it if Coonrod was here. There 
I go ag'in ! Mercy ! mercy ! " 

"Well, do come along, then, mother, ' said Mela; 
and she got her out of the room, with Mrs. Mandel's 
help, and up the stairs. 

From the top the old woman called down : " You 

tell Coonrod " She stopped, and he heard her 

groan out, "My Lord ! my Lord !" 

He sat, one silence in the dining-room, where they 
had all lingered together, and in the lil>rary beyond 
the hireling watcher sat, another silence. The time 
passed, but neither moved, and the last noise in the 
house ceased, so that they heard each other breathe, 
and the vague, remote rumour of the city invaded the 
inner stillness. It grew louder toward morning, and 
then Dryfoos knew from the watcher's deeper 
breathing that he had fallen into a doze. 

He crept by him to the drawing-room, where his 
son was ; the place was full of the awful sweetness 
of the flowers that Fulkerson had brought, and that 
lay above the pulseless breast. The old man turned 
up a burner in the chandelier, and stood looking on 
the majestic serenity of the dead face. 

He could not move when he saw his wife coming 
down the stairway in the hall. She was in her long 
white flannel bedcrown, and the candle she carried 



  

shook with lior nervous tremor. Ho thought slic 
might be -walking in her sleep, but she said, quite 
simply, " I woke up, and I couldn't git to sleep ag'in 
without comin' to have a look." She stood beside 
their dead son with him. " "Well, he 's beautiful, 
Jacob. He was the prettiest baby ! And ho was 
always good, Coonrod was ; I 'll say that for him. 
I don't believe he ever give me a minute's care in 
his whole life. I reckon I liked him about the best 
of all the childern ; but I don't know as I ever done 
much to show it. But you was always good to him, 
Jacob ; you always done the best for him, ever since 
he was a little feller. I used to be afraid you 'd spoil 
him sometimes in them days ; but I guess you 're glad 
now for every time you didn't cross him. I don't 
suppose since the twins died you ever hit him a 
lick." She stooped and peered closer at the face. 
" Why, Jacob, what's that there by his pore eye ?" 
Dryfoos saw it too, the wound that he had feared 
to look for, and that now seemed to redden on his 
sight. He broke into a low, wavering cry, like a 
child's in despair, like an animal's in terror, like a 
soul's in the anguish of remorse. 



VII. 



The evening after the funeral, while the Marches 
sat together talking it over, and making approaches, 
through its shadow, to the question of their own 
future, which it involved, they were startled by the 
twitter of the electric bell at their apartment door. 
It was really not so late as the children's having 
gone to bed made it seem ; but at nine o'clock it was 
too late for any probable visitor except Fulkerson. 
It might be he, and March was glad to postpone the 
impending question to his curiosity concerning the 
immediate business Fulkerson might have with him. 
He went himself to the door, and confronted there 
a lady deeply veiled in black, and attended by a 
very decorous serving-woman. 

"Are you alone, Mr. March — you and Mrs. 
March ? " asked the lady, behind her veil ; and as he 
hesitated, she said, " You don't know me ! Miss 
Vance ; " and she threw back her veil, showing her 
face wan and agitated in the dark folds, "I am 
very anxious to see you — to speak with you both. 
May I come in ? " 

" Why, certainly. Miss Vance," he answered, still 
too much stupefied by her presence to realise it. 




  

She promptly entered, nnti sayincr, wiih a glance 
at the hall chair by the door, "My maid can sit 
here ? " followed him to the room whcre he had left 
his wife. 

Mrs. !March showed herself more capable of coping 
 with the fact. She welcomed Miss Vance with the 
liking they both felt for the girl, and with the 
sympathy which her troubled face inspired. 

"I won't tire you with excuses for coming, Mrs. 
March," she said, "for it was the only thing left for 
me to do ; and I come at my aunt's suggestion." 
She added this as if it would help to account for her 
more on the conventional plane, and she had the 
instinctive good taste to address herself throughout 
to INIrs. March as much as possible, though what she 
had to say was mainly for March. "I don't know 
how to begin-I don't know how to speak of this 
terrible affair. But you know what I mean. I feel 
as if I had lived a whole lifetime since it — happened. 
I don't want you to pity me for it," she said, fore- 
stalling a politeness from Mrs. March. "I'm the 
last one to be thought of, and you mustn't mind mo 
if I try to make you. I came to find out all of the 
truth that I can, and when I know just what that is 
I shall know what to do. I have read the inquest ; 
it's all burnt into my brain. But I don't care for 
that — for myself : you must let me say such things 
without minding me. I know that your husband — 
that Mr. March was there ; I read his testimony ; 

and I wished to ask him — to ask him " She 

stopped and looked distractedly about, " But what 



  

folly ! He must have said everything he knew — he 
had to." Her eyes wandered to him from his wife, 
on whom she had kept them with instinctive tact. 

"I said everything — yes," he replied. "But if 
you would like to know " 

"Perhaps I had better tell you something first. 
I had just parted with him — it couldn't have been 
more than half an hour — in front of Brentano's ; he 
must have gone straight to his death. We were 
talking, and I — I said, Why didn't some one go 
among the strikers and plead with them to be peace- 
able, and keep them from attacking the new men. 
I knew that he felt as I did about the strikers; 
that he M\as their friend. Did you see — do you 
know anything that makes you think he had been 
trying to do that ? " 

"I am sorry," March began, "I didn't sec him at 
all till — till I saw him lying dead." 

"My husband was there purely by accident," 
Mrs. March put in. " I had begged and entreated 
him not to go near the striking anywhere. And he 
had just got out of the car, and saw the policeman 
strike that wretched Lindau — he's been such an 
anxiety to me ever since we have had anything to 
do with him here ; my husband knew him when he 
was a boy in the West. Mr. March came home 
from it all perfectly prostrated ; it made us all sick ! 
Nothing so horrible ever came into our lives before. 
I assure you it was the most shocking experience." 

Miss Vance listened to her with that look of 
patience which those who have seen much of the 




real suffering of the world — tlic daily portion of the 
poor — have for the nervous woes of comfortable 
people. March hung his head ; he knew it would 
be useless to protest that his share of the calamity 
 was, by comparison, infinitesimally small. 

After she had heard Mrs. March to the end even 
of her repetitions, Miss Vance said, as if it were a 
mere matter of course that she should have looked 
the affair up, " Yes, I have seen Mr. Lindau at the 
hospital " 

"My husband goes every day to see him," Mrs, 
March interrupted, to give a final touch to the con- 
ception of March's magnanimity throughout. 

"The poor man seems to have been in the wrong 
at the time," said Miss Vance. 

"I could almost say he had earned the right to 
be wrong. He 's a man of the most generous in- 
stincts, and a high ideal of justice, of equity — too 
high to be considered by a policeman with a club 
in his hand," said March, with a bold defiance of his 
wife's different opinion of Lindau. "It's the police- 
man's business, I suppose, to club the ideal when he 
finds it inciting a riot." 

"Oh, I don't blame Mr. Lindau; I don't blame 
the policeman ; he was as much a mere instrument 
as his club was. I am only trying to find out how 
much I am to blame myself. I had no thought of 
Mr. Dryfoos's going there — of his attempting to talk 
with the strikers and keep them quiet ; I was only 
thinking, as women do, of what I should try to do 
if I were a man. But perhaps he understood me to 



  

ask him to go — perhaps my words sent him to his 
death." 

She had a sort of calm in her courage to know 
the worst truth as to her responsibility that forbade 
any wish to flatter her out of it. "I'm afraid," 
said March, "that is what can never be known 
now." After a moment he added, '* But why should 
you wish to know ? If he went there as a peace- 
maker, he died in a good cause, in such a way as he 
would wish to die, I believe." 

" Yes," said the girl ; "I have thought of that. 
But death is awful ; we must not think patiently, 
forgivingly of sending any one to their death in the 
best cause." 

"I fancy life was an awful thing to Conrad 
Dryfoos," March replied. "He was thwarted and 
disappointed, without even pleasing the ambition 
that thwarted antl disappointed him. That poor old 
man, his father, warped him from his simple, life- 
long wish to be a minister, and was trying to make 
a business-man of him. If it will be any consolation 
to you to know it, Miss Vance, I can assure you 
that he was very unhappy, and I don't see how he 
could ever haAe been happy here." 

"It won't," said the girl steadily. "If people 
are born into this world, it's because they were 
meant to live in it. It isn't a question of being 
happy here ; no one is happy, in that old selfish way, 
or can be ; but he could have been of great use." 

" Perhaps he was of use in dying. Who knows ? 
He may have been trying to silence Lindau." 


 

" Oh, Lindau wasn't worth it ! " cried Mrs. !March, 

Miss Vance looked at her as if she did not quite 
understand. Then she turned to March. " He 
might have been unhappy, as we all are ; but I 
know that his life here would have had a higher 
happiness than we wish for or aim for." The tears 
began to run silently down her cheeks. 

"Ho looked strangely happy that day when he 
left me. He had hurt himself somehow, and his face 
was bleeding from a scratch ; he kept his handkerchief 
up ; he was pale, but such a light came into his face 
when he shook hands — ah, I know he went to try 
and do what I said ! " They were all silent, while 
she dried her eyes and then put her handkerchief 
back into the pocket from which she liad suddenly 
pulled it, with a series of vivid, young-ladyish ges- 
tures, which struck March by their incongruity with 
the occasion of their talk, and yet by their harmony 
with the rest of her elegance. " I am sorry, Miss 
Vance," he began, " that I can't really tell you any- 
thing more " 

" You are very kind," she said, controlling herself 
and rising quickly. " I thank you — thank you both 
very much." She turned to Mrs. March and shook 
hands with her and then with him. "I might have 
known — I did know that there wasn't anything more 
for you to tell. But at least I 've found out from 
you that there teas nothing, and now I can begin to 
bear what I must. How are those poor creatures 
— his mother and father, his sisters ? Some day, 
I hope, I shall be ashamed to have postponed 



  

 the m to the thought of myself ; but I can't pre- 
tend to be yet. I could not come to the funeral ; I 
wanted to." 

She addressed her question to Mrs. March, who 
answered : " I can understand. But they were 
pleased with the flowers you sent; people are, at 
such times, and they haven't many friends." 

" "Would you go to see them ] " asked the girl. 
" Would you tell them what I 've told you ? " 

Mrs. March looked at her husband. 

"I don't see what good it would do. They 
wouldn't understand. But if it would relieve 
you " 



" I 'll wait till it isn't a question of self-relief," 
said the girl. " Good-bye ! " 

She left them to long debate of the event. At 
the end Mrs. March said, " She is a strange being ; 
such a mixture of the society girl and the saint." 

Her husband answered : " She 's the potentiality 
of several kinds of fanatic. She's very unhappy, 
and I don't see how she 's to be happier about that 
poor fellow. I shouldn't be surprised if she did 
inspire him to attempt something of that kind." 

" Well, you got out of it very well, Basil. I 
admired the way you managed. I was afraid you 'd 
say something awkward." 

" Oh, with a plain line of truth before me, as the 
only possible thing, I can get on pretty well. When 
it comes to anything decorative, I'd rather leave it 
to you, Isabel." 

She seemed insensible of his jest. " Of course he 




was in love with her. That was the light that came 

into his face when he was going to do what he 

thought she wanted him to do." 

" And she — do you think that she was " 

" What an idea ! It would have been perfectly 

grotesque ! " 



VIII. 

Their affliction brought the Dryfooses into 

humaner relations with the Marches, who had 

hitherto regarded them as a necessary evil, as the 

odious means of their own prosperity. Mrs. March 

found that the women of the family seemed glad of 

her coming, and in the sense of her usefulness to them 

all she began to feel a kindness even for Christine. 

But she could not help seeing that between the girl 

and her father there was an unsettled account, some- 

 f" how, and that it was Christine and not the old man 

I who was holding out. She thought that their sorrow 

had tended to refine the others. JMela was much 

more subdued, and except when she abandoned her 

self to a childish interest in her mourning, she did 

nothing to shock Mrs. March's taste, or to seem 

__- unworthy of her grief. She was very good to her 

*s mother, whom the blow had left unchanged, and to 

her father, whom it had apparently fallen upon with 

crushing weight. Once, after visiting their house, 

Mrs. March described to March a little scene between 

Dryfoos and Mela, when he came home from Wall 

Street, and the girl met him at the door with a kind 

of country simpleness, and took his hat and stick, 



and brouglit him into the room where Mrs. March 
sat, looking tired and broken. 

She found this look of Diyfoos's pathetic, and 
dwelt on the sort of stupefaction there was in it; 
he must have loved his son more than they ever 
realised. "Yes," said March, "I suspect he did. 
He 's never been about the place since that day ; he 
was always dropping in before, on his way uptown. 
He seems to go down to Wall Street every day, just 
as before, but I suppose that's mechanical; he 
wouldn't know what else to do ; I dare say it's best 
for him. The sanguine Fulkcrson is getting a little 
anxious about the future of Every Oilier week. Now 
Conrad 's gone, he isn't sure the old man will want 
to keep on with it, or whether he 'll have to look up 
another Angel. He wants to get married, I imagine, 
and he can't venture till this point is settled." 

" It 's a very material point to ns, too, Basil," said 
Mrs. March. 

"Well, of course. I hadn't overlooked that, you 
may be sure. One of the things that Fulkerson and 
I have discussed is a scheme for buying the magazine. 
Its success is pretty well assured now, and I shouldn't 
be afraid to put money into it — if I had the money." 

" I couldn't let you sell the house in Boston, Basil !" 

"And I don't want to. I wish we could go back 
and live in it, and get the rent too ! It would be 
quite a support. But I suppose if Dryfoos won't 
keep on, it must come to another Angel, I hope it 
won't be a literary one, with a fancy for running my 
department." 



  

" Oil, I guess whoever takes the magazine will be 
glad enough to keep you ! " 

" Do you think so ? "Well, perhaps. But I don't 
believe Fulkerson would let mc stand long between 
him and an Angel of the right description." 

"Well, then, I believe he would. And you've 
never seen anything, Basil, to make you really think 
that Mr. Fulkerson didn't appreciate you to the 
utmost." 

" I think I came pretty near an undervaluation in 
that Lindau trouble. I shall always wonder what put 
a backbone into Fulkerson, just at that crisis. Fulker- 
son doesn't strike me as the stuff of a moral hero." 

"At any rate, he was one," said Mrs. March, "and 
that's quite enough for me." 

March did not answer. " What a noble thing life 
is, anyway ! Here I am, well on the way to fifty, 
after twenty-five years of hard work, looking forward 
to the potential poor-house as confidently as I did in 
youth. We might have saved a little more than we 
have saved ; but the little more wouldn't avail if I 
were turned out of my place now ; and we should 
have lived sordidly to no purpose. Some one 
always has you by the throat, unless you have some 
one else in your grip. I wonder if that 's the attitude 
the Almighty intended his respectable creatures to 
take toward one another ! I wonder if he meant 
our civilisation, the battle we fight in, the game we 
trick in ! I wonder if he considers it final, and if 
the kingdom of heaven on earth, which we pray 
for " 


" Have you seen Lindau to-day ? " Mrs. March 
asked. 

"You inferred it from the quahty of my piety?" 
March laughed, and then suddenly sobered. "Yes, 
I saw him. It's going rather hard with him, I'm 
afraid. The amputation doesn't heal very well ; 
the shock was very great, and he 's old. It 'll take 
time. There 's so much pain that they have to keep 
him under opiates, and I don't think he fully knew 
me. At any rate, I didn't get my piety from him 
to-day." 

"It's horrible! Horrible!" said Mrs. March. 
" I can't get over it ! After losing his hand in the 
war, to lose his whole arm now in this way ! It 
does seem too cruel ! Of course he oughtn't to have 
been there ; we can say that. But yoii oughtn't to 
have been there either, Basil." 

" Well, I wasn't exactly advising the police to go 
and club the railroad presidents." 

"Neither was poor Conrad Dryfoos." 

"I don't deny it. All that was distinctly the 
chance of life and death. That belonged to God ; 
and no doubt it was law, though it seems chance. 
But what I object to is this economic chance-world 
in which we live, and which we men seem to have 
created. It ought to be law as inflexible in human 
affairs as the order of day and night in the ])hysical 
world, that if a man will work he shall both rest 
and eat, and shall not be harassed with any question 
as to how his repose and his provision shall come. 
Nothins: less ideal than this satisfies the reason. 



  

But in our state of things no one is secure of this. 
No one is sure of finding work ; no one is sure of 
not losing it. I may have my  work taken away 
from me at any moment by the caprice, the mood, 
the indigestion of a man who has not the qualifica- 
tion for knowing whether I do it well or ill. At 
my time of life — at every time of life — a man ought 
to feel that if he will keep on doing his duty he 
shall not suffer in himself or in those who are dear 
to him, except through natural causes. But no man 
can feel this as things are now ; and so we go on, 
pushing and pulling, climbing and crawling, thrust- 
ing aside and trampling underfoot ; lying, cheating, 
stealing ; and when we get to the end, covered with 
blood and dirt and sin and shame, and look back 
over the way we 've come to a palace of our own, or 
the poor-house, which is about the only possession 
we can claim in common with our brother-men, I 
don't think the retrospect can be pleasing." 

" I know, I know ! " said his wife. " I think of 
those things too, Basil. Life isn't what it seems 
when you look forward to it. But I think people 
would suffer less, and wouldn't have to work so 
hard, and could make all reasonable provision for 
the future, if they were not so greedy and so 
foolish." 

" Oh, without doubt ! We can't put it all on the 
conditions ; we must put some of the blame on 
character. But conditions inake character; and 
people are greedy and foolish, and wish to have and 
to shine, because having and shining are held up to 



  

them by civilisation as the chief good of life. Wo 
all know they are not the chief good, perhaps not 
good at all ; but if some one ventures to say so, all 
the rest of us call him a fraud and a crank, and go 
moiling and toiling on to the palace or the poor- 
house. We can't help it. If one were less greedy, 
or less foolish, some one else would have, and would 
shine at his expense. We don't moil and toil to our- 
selves alone; the palace or the poor-house is not 
merely for ourselves, but for our children, whom we've 
brought up in the superstition that having and shining 
is the chief good. We dare not teach them otherwise, 
for fear they may falter in the fight, when it comes 
their turn ; and the children of others will crowd 
them out of the palace into the poor-house. If wo 
felt sure that honest work shared by all would bring 
them honest food shared by all, some heroic few of 
us, who did not wish our children to rise above their 
fellows — though we could not bear to have them fall 
below — might trust them with the truth. But we 
liave no such assurance ; and so we go on trembling 
before Dryfooses, and living in gimcrackeries." 

" Basil, Basil ! I was always willing to live more 
simply than you. You know I was ! " 

" I know you always said so, my dear. But how 
many bell-ratchets and speaking-tubes would you 
be willing to have at the street door below ? I re- 
member that when we were looking for a flat you 
rejected every building that had a bell-ratchet or a
