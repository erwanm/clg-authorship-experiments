weakness and trying pain ; Basil who never counted 
fatigue and sleepless nights. They have loved each 
other with something beyond brotherly love. Oh, so to 
love and so to deceive ! Oh, so to trust and so to be 
deceived ! 

Not a thought concerning the fortune comes to Basil in 
that hour. It is simply the lack of confidence, the betrayal 
of affection. For surely Basil had a right to know, if not 
another soul in the world had been told. 

He goes over the letter several times before he can fix 
it in his mind, so great is the utter incredulousness. He 
looks at it with all the prejudice on this side, though he 
calls himself dispassionate. The girl is fair and young 
and sweet, and loves Lloyd ; the aunt has been so good to 
him, and nursed him tenderly through an illness that he 
mentions now for the first time. Basil can see the schem- 
ing underneath, the fortune they think of. No doubt the 
aunt has informed herself of his circumstances, — there are 
plenty of ways. It is a despicable, treacherous plot, and 
Lloyd has been drawn into a net and will be shorn by this 
adventuring Delilah. 

When he says they know nothing of his true position, 
and that in any case the estate must not go out of the 
name or into stranger hands, Basil smiles with stinging 
bitterness. All these old protestations pass for nothing. 
He should not grudge Lloyd's child his father's wealth, 


he says loftily to himself, but to be so wronged in confi- 
dence by the human being you had trusted implicitly! 
Basil pities himself profoundly. 

His has always been the stronger, governing mind. He 
is the elder ; he has one of those imperious, pervasive 
physiques that influence any one they will. He has not 
cared to have a sweetheart ; he has devoted himself to 
Liloyd, and Lloyd used all his eloquence to persuade Basil 
to accompany him abroad ; but since Dr. and Mrs. Pres- 
cott were going, and there seemed an urgent necessity for 
Basil to remain at home, he contented Lloyd with a prom- 
ise that he would come at any urgent summons. Dr. 
Prescott's tidings had been so reassuring. 

There is another keen pang for Basil Wentworth. He 
is an aristocrat perliaps ; he has a love ingrained in his 
very life for old families, old houses, and generations of 
clean, honorable men. Every portrait at the Elms is dear 
to him, every legend is carefully treasured. He would cut 
off his right hand before he would bring a blot on the 
memory of those brave men and fair women. Lloyd has 
not half the family pride. How often he has said, " Why 
did not grandfather choose you to carry on the family, and 
just leave me a competency ? " 

And that this should be thrown away upon a woman 
picked up in a chance manner, with no antecedents, or 
perhaps dishonorable ones, is unendurable. He feels at 
first as if the law ought to interpose and declare Lloyd 
Wentworth an incapable. If it were not that 7ie, Basil, 
might profit by such a step, he would set it on foot at 
once, but a finer honor holds him back. 

" Well," his mother says that evening, when the others 
have gone to their pleasures, " did you make it out? Is 
he really married ? '' 

'' Lloyd could not be a villain, if he is weak. It does 
not run in the Wentworth blood, thank God ! " he an' 
swers, proudly. 





She feels almost as if she could prefer a dishonorable 
connection. 

" Then I suppose — do you think he will return ? " 

' ' No, '' Basil replies, emphatically. ' ' Lloyd is not strong 
enough, mentally or physically, to face us all, and to bear 
the onus of such a crazy step. Of course, mother, it will 
make a great difference in all our lives and prospects," he 
adds, bitterly. 

" Well, he would have to make a new will ; and if he 
should not — but no doubt her people have made him settle 
nearly everything on her." 

" He says nothing has been asked for ; quotes that as a 
proof of their utter simplicity and disinterestedness," Basil 
exclaims, scornfully. 

'' That is curious, to say the least " ; and she looks ques- 
tioningly at her son. 

" There will be children, of course. That settles it, you 
know," decisively. 

Mrs. Went worth sighs. 

''What shall you say in reply? What, or how much, 
notice ought we to take of it? " she asks. 

" I cannot decide at once. It almost seems, by his wait- 
ing so long before he informed us, as if he meant it to 
remain quite private. At least, let us do nothing hastily. 
We will keep it to ourselves for the present." 

Basil is disinclined to discuss it any further. He pres- 
ently retires to his room, and she sits and thinks. Olive is 
in the drawing-room improvising on the organ, her delight. 
If Olive could have had the Wentworth dower of beauty, — 
of course, this wife of Lloyd's is beautiful ; he always was 
so sensitive and susceptible on the subject. Gilbert? 
Surely there is some remembrance connected with it. She 
has heard some story, not a creditable one either. Does 
she know of any Gilberts here ? Ordinary as the name is, 
it is not quite a common one. 

Mrs . Wentworth racks her brains . She repeats the name 



 



 



 

over uid over, and presently a vague form seems to rise 
from the misty chaos of past gossip. It was something 
in a letter, — ah ! she thinks how, and seems to catch at a 
tangible clew. There are her friend's letters from abroad. 
Mrs. Lessing has really expatriated herself for the sake 
of her husband's health. A year or more ago they were 
in Florence ; now they are on the French coast, in the 
pleasant southern valleys. 

She hunts over the letters. She has kept them because 
they are so bright and chatty ; beside, there is the linger- 
ing fragrance of a school-girl friendship between her and 
Mrs. Lessing. Yes, here it is, full of Florentine descrip- 
tions, palaces and pictures, libraries and statues, and 
society gossip. 

"Do you remember the Conynghams?" she writes. 

'' Mrs. C married her two daughters admu'ably, but 

she has been having a good deal of trouble with her son. 
He used to haunt a house here, where second and third 
rate Americans congregated, with rather questionable 
foreigners. There was an immense deal of gayety at 
these Gilberts'. Mrs. Gilbert is quite a fascinating 
woman, I believe, and she always has some dashing young 
girl to chaperon, or use for a decoy, it is as probable. 
There was a great deal of playing, and Al Conyngham 
was drawn into it, lost a considerable sum of money, 
and became engaged to the demoiselle. I do not know 
how his mamma would have managed, but some dis- 
creditable scandal about a count who frequented the 
place came out, and the young fellow retired in disgust. 
I believe he is now engaged to a very nice English girl. 
It is such people as these that bring our American girls 
into disrepute. Al was lucky to get out of it so well. 
He is a very fair young fellow, I believe. I am often 
thankful I have no sons or daughters to feel anxious 
about." 

Mrs. Wentworth sits as if slowly turning to stone. The 



 



 



 

family have not been given to mesaUiaiices^ even as 
American prospects go, but that Lloyd — and, after all, 
what more natural? They should not have trusted him to 
go alone ; yet they did feel very secure. He was not a 
general admirer of the sex ; friendly, but never lover- 
like ; and he had settled his future so positively that no 
one could dream of such a danger. But this Mrs. Gilbert 
had nursed him in his illness, and charmed him by a hun- 
dred little attentions, until between her and the niece they 
had captured him. No, he would never bring such a 
woman home ; Basil was right. 

While her wrath is kindled within her, she opens her 
desk and writtes rapidly. The Conynghams have returned 
to New York, and the young wife has been much admired. 
The old uncle, from whom they had expectations, is so 
pleased that he has settled a house upon the new couple, 
and they will not return to Westwater. The Conyngham 
property is for sale. All this she gossips of lightly to her 
friend; then adds, "What became of those Gilberts who 
so nearly sti^anded him? Did she marry her protegee 
— did you say it was her niece — to her liking ? I agree 
with you that it is a disgrace, and one hard to be borne, 
that we should be represented abroad by such women." 

There is much more, though Mrs. Lessing may not 
guess from the tenor how her friend's soul is torn and 
disquieted by the prospect of gossip to come. After she 
sends her letter, the next morning she tells her son what 
she has done, and gives him her friend's epistle. 

" It is a shameful, disgraceful thing ! " he declares. " I 
never can forgive Lloyd. I hope the matter will be kept 
quiet. Do not mention it even in the household." 

He is white with anger, and his lips make a blue line. 
How true it is, — 

'' But to be wroth with one we love, 

Doth work like madness in the brain." 



 



 



 

Alas for plans of secrecy! That evening's Gazette 
has the marriage notice. Only one thing saves it from 
being a crushing blow. It is "Doris Hawthorne, only 
daughter of Erasmus Hawthorne, deceased, of Brussels." 
No mention of the Gilberts proves that even Lloyd was 
ashamed of them. There is, of course, a narrow chance 
that it may be some other Gilberts. 

The remainder of the Wentworth household are elec- 
trified. That Basil and their mother have heard directly 
is some satisfaction, but they all join in condemnation 
of Lloyd, whom they loved as a favorite brother, and who 
has been more generous to them than brothers usually are. 
Agatha is shocked, Graham is indignant with all the 
strength and fervor of youth, and Olive is in a whirlwind 
of passion. Louise, who is a rather romantic young gh-l, 
takes it the most moderately. 

" Doris," she says. " What an odd, pretty name ; very 
English, too, even if she did live at Brussels." 

Mrs. Wentworth makes no comment on that. She 
hopes the matter will in some way be confused, so the real 
truth will never serve for the edification of Westwater. 

That evening Agatha comes to her room with a calm, 
curiously set face. She is tall, graceful, with a fair, fine 
skin, dark hair and eyes, pure outlines as the olden 
" daughter of the gods." All her life she has held up 
her head in this regal way, and been a queen in her own 
circle, with no desire to step out of it, — yes, one that she 
has inwardly fought against, and could hardly resolve 
whether to take any outward, decisive step. But she 
means to cross the narrow bridge now. She has never 
been much troubled with mercenary considerations. She 
has lain, so to speak, in the "roses and lilies of life" 
ever since life was worth remembering. At her father's 
death they came here to live, and she has been the daugh- 
ter of this house, not that at Larch Avenue. That it 
would be Basil's home has for years been a foregone con- 



elusion. Since he has attained his majority, Lloyd has 
been princely generous with them all, and they have un- 
consciously slipped into the habit of considering it theirs, 
or taking it without much consideration, confusing his 
generosity with duty. 

''Mother," Agatha begins, and a curious little pallor 
flickers over her face as a color does not infrequently; 
" Mr. Stirling is to call at nine, to see you especially." 

There is a very slight inflection, but it conveys the 
meaning at once. 

" Agatha ! " Her mother's tone is one of surprise. 

" He spoke of some matters this afternoon as we were 
driving," the proud daughter says, in her loftiest manner. 
" You and Basil are my natural guardians, I believe." 

" But — what have you done ? What do you wish me to 
say ? " she asks, breathlessly. 

"If he is disagreeable to you, if you disapprove of him 
in any way — " 

''My dear Agatha!" 

Mrs. Wentworth is an ambitious mother. Secretly she 
has longed for this son-in-law, but she has fancied such a 
thing could never be. Since childhood Agatha has had a 
"loyal knight and true," the son of a neighbor, an old, 
proud, and refined family, but much impoverished. What 
straits Mrs. Trevenna and her sister Miss Van Antwerp 
have endured to educate their last descendant, neither the 
world nor the youth will ever know. That he has trav- 
ersed his mother's hopes and a faint aspiration of his own 
is one of the secrets that carry a little pang, but he has 
chosen law, has read for it, and been admitted to the bar 
in his mother's native city, Philadelphia. He has also been 
taken into an old and reputable legal firm, and is trying 
hard to push his way up toward a prize, the coveted hand 
of Agatha Wentworth. No vows have been mado, no 
promises given, neither have any endearments passed 
between them that it will stain her check to remember ; 



 



 



 

vut she has known his aims and hopes ; they have lingered 
many an evening in the fragrant walks, and talked, not only 
of a proud future, but a high one as well. The great 
problems of the day have stirred them both, she in a pure 
and lofty way that would have a world of scholars, 
poets, idealists, noble and refined men and women ; he on 
the broader outlook perhaps, that comprehends a growth 
from the lower forms to the higher. Sometimes she 
draws a line at his too democratic tendencies, and shrinks 
from what she insists verges toward socialism. Reese 
Trevenna feels at times that these fine boundaries chafe 
and restrict him, but he is making a man for her accept- 
ance, in the far future when he reaches the full stature 
and has won some fame, and, with a sigh, he admits, a for- 
tune to lay at her feet. He has come and gone at Elm 
Place quite as a family friend ; he has escorted the girls 
as a brother might ; they have sung and played and danced 
together, and they all know his desire, but they wonder a 
little about Agatha. 

Indeed, after she has declined several advantageous 
offers, Mrs. Wentworth settles reluctantly to the fact that 
Reese will win the flower of her garden of girls. She 
does not quite approve, Agatha feels, by the way she 
ignores any possibly grave side to the boy and girl 
friendship. 

But now her amazement is so complete that for the 
moment she is confused and helpless, and she says again, 
as if for reassurance, — 

" My dear Agatha ! " 

"My dear mamma," and there is a faint tinge of 
impatience as well as imperiousness in the daughter's tone, 
"one would think you had not remarked Mr. Stkling's 
very pronounced attentions. With a gentleman, such 
matters can have but one meaning. And if he had not 
been acceptable to me, I should not have allowed so much 
of it " ; and she breaks off with a constrained Uttle laugh. 



 



 



 

Mrs. Wentworth discerns her daughter's resolve. She 
has secretly sighed for this termination ; but now that it 
confronts her, she shrinks somewhat from the responsibility 
she knows in her inmost soul must accompany it. 

" If / could have chohen for you from among those 
whom we have been in the habit of meeting, he would 
have been my first preference," confesses the mother, with 
an elation which does find its way through her voice. 
''But, Agatha, are you quite certain of your own re- 
gard?" 

She must make this stand to clear her conscience in tie 
time to come if another soul should appeal to her. 

" Mother," Agatha Wentworth replies, in the calm, self- 
contained voice she has used before, "I am not like 
Louise, full of impossible and romantic ideals. I know 
the kind of world I have to live in, that I desire to live 
in," as if half correcting herself. " I must have certain 
refined surroundings ; I must have a noble and honorable 
man, whose tastes and wishes are in accordance with my 
own. I have little faith in making over people ; I would 
have a true and solid foundation for my esteem. The 
rest can develop according to circumstances. I do not 
believe any delicate and high-minded woman can love a 
man when he makes his first advances, as fervently as 
after years of life together ; at least, I could not." 

"No," the mother replies, approvingly. 

There is quite a silence. 

" I should like to be married here at the Elms," Agatha 
continues. "It is the only home I have really known. 
Early childish impressions are more of events than 
places," and her tone is retrospective. "There will no 
doubt be some changes when Lloyd comes back with his 
wife." 

"It is dreadful!" Mrs. Wentworth moans, as the 
vision stares her in the face. "But Basil thinks he is 
not likely to return soon. Dv. Prescott has had a letter 
as well." 



 



 



 

" It is disgraceful ! How could Lloyd do such a thing? 
My very heart aches for Basil, proudly as he bears it. It 
overturns the plans of his whole life. It makes a great 
difference to us all ; but if I^ am happily settled, there will 
be one thing off your mind." 

The bell at the hall door sounds up here, lightly as it 
has been touched. Agatha glances her mother over crit- 
ically. " You will do," she says, with a half-smQe. 

Mrs. Wentworth kisses her on the forehead. She is 
not a demonstrative mother. Agatha sinks into a chair 
as soon as she is gone. She feels very confident of her- 
self ; indeed, there has been no contest. She has simply 
limited herself to certain conclusions. Lloyd's marriage 
may have hurried these, but certainly she could never 
have accepted the severe struggle of comparative poverty 
standing on that border-land, as she must have done with 
the doors of society open on every hand. Surely she 
has chosen wisely, and it is time this half -love, half- 
friendship of her girl life came to an end. She is past 
twenty, and a woman. 

Olive has suddenly flown from her post at the organ at 
the sound of the bell, though she has not been playing 
for the last half -hour. She threads her way through the 
hall, out at a side entrance, and down one of the dim, 
fragrant walks. The moon is coming up with its tawny 
October light. They are in the midst of glowing Indian 
summer, and the air dry, with a smell of resinous pines 
and balsams in it. There is no thought of the beauty of 
the night in her mind ; she is trying to escape from some- 
thing that holds her in a giant's clasp, and she does not 
notice Basil until his outstretched arms save her from 
a fall. 

" You here, Olive ! " he exclaims, in surprise. 

" I did not know you were here," she returns, almost 
savagely. Her first impulse is to break away ; then he 
feels that she relaxes in every tense nerve. 





" Basil," in a curious, passionate tone, hardly above a 
whisper, yet it has in it a cruel exultation, "you have 
your reward. Are you satisfied with it ? Would you so 
much rather see that foreign thing mistress at the Elms, 
and you crowded out? I should not have thinist you 
out." 

"O Olive, hush! It could not have been. I thought 
you had forgotten. I hoped so." 

''But tills could be. Do you suppose she loves him 
any better than I ? Why, you might have had everything, 
save some little comer into which I could creep when he 
was gone. And she will come flaunting into your very 
faces all the wealth you have lost. You have your re- 
ward. And I hate her bitterly! She has cajoled him 
into marrying her; you could have persuaded tim into 
maiTying me. Basil, you were cruel, cruel! You de- 
serve to suffer." 

"Olive, my poor sister — " 

"Why did you not pity me then?" she demands, 
straightening herself into rigid lines, but not leaving his 
arms. " You thought because I was small and backward, 
and not pretty, as Louise and Agatha, that it was only a 
childish whim. I loved him better than they will ever 
love, than they are capable of loving," she adds, with 
a sneer that sends a shiver over him. "Why, I would 
have been his slave. I would have nursed him in sick- 
ness ; I would have watched and tended, and held all 
other women at bay. He must have cared for me at 
length. His heart was not a stone." 

Her voice drops from intense, tremulous excitement. 
He pities her profoundly, but he hates to tell her now, 
just as he did before, that she could not have won Lloyd's 
regard ; that he never had anything but the most cousinly 
feeling for her ; that Lloyd's love of grace, harmony, of 
fair faces, would have stood like a wall between. Not 
even pity, he is quite sure, would have moved him. 



 



 



 

''You know mother would not have approved of 
cousins marrying," he begins, evasively. "And we all 
thought—" 

'' Yes, you all thought," she repeats, mockingly, " blind 
that you were ! Here he had us all to minister to him, to 
read and play and sing, to sit and fan him if his finger 
ached ; and when he was left in a strange land alone, do 
you not suppose he longed for some one ? She came in 
his way, and he married her ; that was all. He never 
gave you a thought, though you fancied you were secure 
enough in his heart. Well, we stand on the same level 
now, Basil," and she laughs shrilly ; "you, that he loved 
so much ; I, for whom you think he could not have cared, 
both cast out." 

" He did care, but not in that way. My dear Olive, 
then, if we are to suffer together — " 

She breaks entkely away from him. 

" Suffer ! " she cries, derisively. " You are disappointed 
about the loss of paltry wealth you hoped to have, but 
you do not know the pang of lost love, love irremediably 
lost, given to another ! You never will, — you and Agatha 
are so wrapped in your proud self-esteem and complacency. 
And the woman that Lloyd Wentworth has made mistress 
of the Elms will come here and queen it over you both. 
If I wanted a triumph," she says, stamping her foot on 
the gravel path rolled like a floor, " that would be it." 

Like a sprite she is gone, hidden again in the dark 
shadows. Could he have pleased her and had it all differ- 
ent ? When it was settled that Lloyd should go abroad 
with the Prescotts, Olive had confessed the depths of her 
love to Basil, and entreated him to plead for her. Basil, 
much shocked at what he considered the utter lack of 
womanliness, had rebuked her sternly, and bade her put 
such an impossible thing out of her mind. For days after 
Lloyd's departure, she had shut herself in her room, re- 
fusing to see any one but the servant. They were quite 
used to Olive's vagaries, so Basil kept her secret. 



 



 



 

No, even if he had been ruled by the most selfish of 
desires, he could not have burdened Lloyd with such a 
capricious, uncertain-tempered companion. That she loved 
him passionately, entirely, was most true ; but she would 
have tormented him by the very unreason of her affection. 

Standing there under the stars, Basil Wentworth sin- 
cerely hopes that Lloyd may mercifully pass away before 
he comes to the flavor of ashes in the cup he is draining. 
Let him keep blindly happy, even if he is mistaken, de- 
ceived. And he feels that he must be generous to make 
this prayer for the one who has betrayed his trust. 

When, a long while afterward, he comes up the broad 
front porch, his mother stands just inside the library 
awaiting him, with a certain expression of importance 
on her face. 

" AVhere is Olive?" he asks, hastily. " Send and see 
if she is in her room." 


"Martha," he says, catching a glimpse of the maid, 
" go and learn if Miss Olive is in her room." 

'' What alarms you so? " 

" Nothing," with studious calmness. " She was roam- 
ing about awhile ago." 

" Olive is so unreasonable and full of vagaries." The 
mother's heart is on other matters, and Olive is sm-ely old 
enough to take care of herself. She does not care suffi- 
ciently for men to have secret lovers. Martha returns 
with the word that she is there. 

" I have some matters to discuss with you, Basil," his 
mother says, in a stately tone. '• I am sorry you were out. 
Mr. Stirling was here, and he wished very much to see 
you." 

" To see me ? " Basil repeats, in amaze. 

"Yes." 

" I should have supposed it would have been Agatha" ; 
and a sense of amusement moves his lips to a half -smile 



 



 



 

"It is a matter of importance, Basil," his mother re- 
marks, gravely. 

Something in her face arrests his attention. She seems 
giving him time to divine it. 

"You do not surely mean that Agatha — mother, 
Agatha does care for Trevenna." 

She cares for him in a sisterly, friendly way. She has 
been a sort of mentor and adviser, and you were all chil- 
dren together, but it is time such childishness came to an 
end, and she sees it herself. Mr. Stirling spoke to her 
this afternoon, and she referred him to me, to us. He 
waited as long as he could to see you." 

Basil drops into one of the arm-chairs. He cannot think 
Agatha understands all that she is doing. 

" He is a perfect and thorough gentleman," the mother 
continues, admiringly. " It will be a great relief to have 
Agatha so well settled, in view of what is before us. I 
feel so at sea, so lost and surprised, whenever I think of 
Lloyd." 

" I hope that has not determined her," he replies, with 
a touch of decision. 

" Agatha might remain single ; she would not marry for 
money or position." 

She is doing both, Basil thinks, and hopes sincerely 
there is love in it as well. 

" And you acquiesced ? " 

"I consented," corrects the mother. "Basil," almost 
sharply, " you seem in a strange mood to-night." 

" Pardon me," straightening himself. " Something has 
perplexed me," he admits. "Then you are quite satis- 
fied?" 

" I think they are admirably adapted to each other, and 
Mr. Stirling evinces the highest and tenderest regard for 
her. After all, his first marriage scarcely counts, you 
know. She was his cousin, and very much in love with 
bim, report says, and already in consumption. One can 



 



 



 

see that Agatha suits him to the finest fibre. He is quite 
desirous of not having a long engagement. It is not as if 
he were a stranger. The Stirlings have lived here half a 
century, and his relatives in Philadelphia are among the 
first people." 

"lie is suitable every way," replies Basil Wentworth. 
'' If Agatha loves him, there is nothing more to say." 

" As she certainly does." 

What will Trevenna think of this, Basil wonders. His 
interest is much more with the absent lover than with the 
fortunate present one. He can see that his mother does 
feel relieved, — quite happy, indeed, — and he rouses 
himself to take an interest. 

But alone in his room he sits till long past midnight. 
He is quite certain that Olive is pacing to and fro ; he 
even fancies that he hears moans of anguish. This is the 
fruit Lloyd's marriage brings, — a bitter, forced ripeness, 
with an unwholesome flavor. For he does not believe, 
under other circumstances, Agatha would have accepted 
Mr. Stirling, though the man is irreproachable. 



 



 



CHAPTER Vm. 

ASHES OF ROSE. 

Agatha Wentworth's engagement quite offsets her 
cousin's European marriage. Stirling House is one of 
the landmarks at Westwater, though nearly a mile re- 
moved from the Ehns, and more in the heart of the town. 
If not so spacious and grand, it is a handsome old man- 
sion, sufficiently modernized to be in keeping with the 
times. Mr. Stirling, when barely twenty, had married his 
cousin, a Miss Richmond, who had not lived quite two 
years ; since then, he and his mother had resided together. 
He was now thirty, a man of much scholarly culture and 
fine tastes, with some literary proclivities of the higher 
intellectual order. Some eighteen months before this he 
had buried his mother. 

Elegant, refined, above ways and wants as Westwater 
held itself, there were ladies who had made more than one 
attempt to attract the grave eyes of Richmond Stirling. 
Yet if there were heart-burnings, there was not a dissen- 
tient voice when the engagement was announced. Agatha 
Wentworth was just the kind of regal woman to dispense 
hospitalities to the men of breadth and culture who had 
delighted in its master's cordial receptions. There were 
warm congratulations on nearly every side. Trevenna, 
being in a Western city on some business for his firm, did 
not hear of it until it was a month old. His mother knew 
of it, but for various reasons had not mentioned it. 

"It is best and wisest as it is," Mrs. Trevenna said, 
when her sister made a pained protest. "I feel certain 
that Agatha never gave him quite that kind of encour- 
agement. He has been like a brother in the Wentworth 



 



 



 

household, and he was very fond of Lloyd. There cer- 
tainly was something not pleasing in that marriage." 

" It would not be pleasing to have such a handsome 
inheritance taken out of the family," returns Miss Van 
Antwerp, who is small, thin, and aristocratic looking, with 
her silvery hair and fine laces. 

'' It wiU make a great difference to them. It always 
seems to me that Basil Wentworth should have been the 
master of the Elms ; indeed, he has been the real head 
for the last five years. It will be sad enough to go 
away." 

They are all anticipating that, but Basil and his mother 
with the greatest bitterness of heart. Agatha will be 
beyond the reach of the small mortifications of economy. 
And although Graham is three-and-twenty, he has done 
nothing since he graduated, two years ago. They all 
have a small portion from their father's estate, and their 
mother has the income of fifteen thousand dollars. There 
is the house on Larch Avenue, to which they must retire. 

Basil, when all his work here is done, will settle himself 
at the practice of law, and do his best to retrieve these 
early years so cruelly wasted. He is trustee of the estate 
and Lloyd's attorney, and manages everything. He can- 
not throw it up, as he longs to do, but he takes great 
credit to himself that he does not do this in a moment of 
anger. He is most scrupulously faithful. 

Reese Trevenna retm-ns home one Saturday, and as 
soon as he can despatch his business, flies to Westwater. 
Striding home from the train, he meets the Stirling car-

favorite cake. He is so bright and eager, so brimful of 
news and descriptions of places and people he has met, 
so humorous and gay, that the older hearts quake within 
their bosoms. 

Some time afterward he goes out for a walk, " as far as 
the Wentworths'," he announces carelessly, and the two 
women sit at home praying that the blow may not smite too
