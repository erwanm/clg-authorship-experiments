"Marilla’s no more trouble than a kitten. 
Jane is positively in love with her. I’m not 
sure but I shall ask to have her transferred 
to me.” 

"Hilda Armitage you ought to be the mother 
of girls. I don’t know about the boys,” with 
a doubtful laugh. 

"I’ve had two disappointments.” 

"I told you that Conklin girl was not worth 
the trouble. She’s singing in a vaudeville 
show and it does suit her. You couldn’t get 
any refined ambition in that vain and silly 
brain. It is casting pearls before swine. Save 
the pearls for some one worthy. She doesn’t 
go back to the Borden’s this summer. When 
you get tired of her — 




‘Shall we quarrel about her?’’ She glanced 
up with an odd, humorous smile. 

'Perhaps we shall in the end, but that is a 
good way off. When that man comes today, 
just let him see Marilla.” 

Mr. Borden came punctually at two and 
was quite profuse in his thanks for Miss 
Armitage’s kindness. 

regret to say that Marilla has progressed 
very slowly. She had quite an exhausting 
fever at first. She was not able to come down- 
stairs until yesterday, and lies down several 
times through the day.” 

"Is it possible! Why we thought — and we 
need her so much! Did you — ” he flushed 
a little, ‘have a good physician?” 

"An excellent one whose practice is mostly 
among children. He thought her quite worn 
out, but it was being overcome with the heat 
and she fell off the steps. It was near con- 
gestion of the brain I believe.” 

'I'm awfully sorry. We were so busy just 
then, and my wife was worried to death. 
The babies had always been so good, but I 
can’t imagine anything being so — so dreadful 
as they’ve been for a week. I’ve scarcely 



slept an hour at a time and Mrs. Borden is 
clear worn out. She thinks just the sight 
of Marilla would comfort them. We might 
go on keeping that Ellen, though the babies 
won't take to her. I think Marilla charmed 
them; but theyVe always been good until 
now. And there's four more teeth to come 
through,' in a despairing sort of tone. 

Miss Armitage had large sympathy and she 
felt really sorry for him. Yet how provi- 
dential that Marilla had missed the care! 

"You have had a very bad time, certainly, 
and it is fortunate that Marilla didn't give 
out on your hands. Would you like to see 
her, though I think she is asleep.'' 

"Yes — oh yes. If we kept Ellen, don't 
you think she might come down next week. 
The sea-bathing would no doubt strengthen 
her.'’ 

"She has some heart weakness. I'm afraid 
she couldn't stand the bathing." 

Then she rose and led the way up stairs. 

Marilla was asleep. Mr. Borden studied 
her in surprise. 

"Why, she's grown dreadfully thin. Yes, 
she must have been very ill, but like the babies. 




she'd always been well. I'm awful sorry. I 
don’t know what we shall do. Mrs. Borden 
had counted so on her coming. And she said 
over half a dozen times that I must not for- 
get to thank you for all this kindness. You 
must send me the doctor’s bill. She’s such a 
nice child, Miss Armitage.” 

Marilla stirred and opened her eyes, closed 
them sighed and opened them again, then 
half murmured — "Oh, doctor,” and started. 

"Marilla, child, don’t you remember Mr- 
Borden?” 

had not told her about your coming. 
We keep her as tranquil as possible.” 

"Oh, Mr. Borden!” Marilla sat up. "And 
the babies?” 

"The babies are in a very poor way, Ma- 
rilla. They certainly are homesick for you. 
We try to keep them comforted with the 
promise of you. Oh, I hoped you would be 
well enough to go down with me this after- 
noon. Their mother will be telling them you 
will surely come. Poor little girl, but you 
are going to get well, aren’t you? And Jack 
thinks there’s no fun without you, and no 
one to read to him or tell him stories.” 



The child gave a vague smile. She was 
very glad to be away from Jack; indeed, sick 
babies did not appear attractive to her just 
now, but she said — 

"Oh, I'm very sorry. The doctor said it 
was the heat and 

'It was awfully hot that week. That made 
the babies worse. Oh, if I could take you 
down just to amuse them. You made them 
laugh so, Marilla. You know just how to do 
it. Well — it can't be helped, but you must 
try to get well and have some good of the 
pretty country place. Is there anything I 
can do for you?’’ 

"Miss Armitage is so good. And Jane and 
the doctor. And the yard is full of flowers. 
I’m very happy.” 

suppose so. Maybe you won’t want to 
come back. But you belong to us, you know 
and we can’t give you up.” 

Then he turned to go. 

"Will you kiss the babies for me and tell 
them how sorry I am, and ask Jack not to 
tease them, and — and — ” she swallowed over 
a great lump in her throat — shall come back 
when I get well.” 





'That’s a good girl. Good-bye. I shall 
be in town next week and will come in and 
see you.” 

He gave the little hand a clasp. Miss 
Armitage went down with him. Marilla 
turned her face over on the pillow and cried 
as if her heart would break. Could she go 
back to the babies and Jack? And Bridget 
wasn’t as sweet as Jane, and there was sharp 
Aunt Hetty 

"My dear! My dear!” said the soft voice 
with its infinite pity, and the sweet lips kissed 
hers. 

"Oh, Miss Armitage, won’t God take you to 
heaven if you pray very hard? I should hate 
to leave you and the dear, nice doctor, but 
I’m afraid I don’t want to go back to the babies 
and Jack. I’m tired of them, and I feel as 
if it was foolish to be funny when there are 
so many sweet things to think of and books 
to read and your beautiful music. But I 
must go away from all that, and somehow 
heaven looks nicer. And when you die 
doesn’t an angel come and take you in his 
arms and just carry you up and up to the 
other side of the sky where everything is 



peace and loveliness, and no one will tor- 
ment you 

my child, perhaps God wants you to 
live here a little longer and do some work for 
him. The doctor would be very sorry not 
to have you get well. Some one might say — 
'He let that little girl die when he might have 
saved her, but they wouldn't know it was 
because she kept brooding over it all the time 
and would make no effort to get well. God 
knows what is best for us.’ 

didn't mind about going back. But to- 
day it seemed to be — dreadful, with a con- 
vulsive sob. 

'Then we have spoiled you. Oh, I am 
sorry for that.'' 

"Oh, dear Miss Armitage, don't be sorry 
when you have been so good. But I don't 
quite understand how anyone can bind you 
out and make you stay years if you didn’t 
want to.” 

"But children do not know what is best for 
them. Some go wandering round the streets 
without any home and are picked up and put 
in a place almost like a prison where they have 
to work whether they like it or not. And some 




even have cruel fathers and mothers. You 
said the Bordens were good to you. Would 
you rather be there or at the Home?’’ 

"Oh, I’d rather be there than at the Home, 

but ” and she swallowed hard over a sob. 

they worked you beyond reason or hah 
starved you a complaint could be made but 
they all seem to love you ” 

Miss Armitage smiled with a soft kind of 
sadness, as if she wished the truth were not 
quite so true, and the things that looked 
so delightful were not so often the thing it 
was best to give up for honor’s sake. 

"Yes, they do love me, babies and all, and 
of course I must go back when I am well 
enough.” 

Then she turned her face away and tried to 
keep back the tears. Jane entered at that 
moment and the tension was broken. 

Miss Armitage read verses to her after she 
was in bed that evening, and kissed her good 
night with motherly tenderness. Then she 
sat for some time and thought. 

Why should she have taken a fancy to this 
little girl? She had seen prettier children who 
were homeless and helped provide for them. 



The Bordens were not rough or heartless. 
Bridget had spoken well of them. The child 
had a comfortable home, and she was bound 
in honor. It would be mean to entice her 
to break the bargain, to make her dissatisfied. 
No, she must not do that. 

Miss Armitage's life lines had run along 
smoothly through girlhood. Her mother 
was a widow and they had a comfortable 
income. Hilda had a good voice and sang 
in church, gave some music lessons. There 
had been a lover and a dear friend and the 
old tradegy had occurred, that might have 
been more heartbreaking if her mother had 
not been taken ill. For days her recovery was 
doubtful. Then an uncle at Los Angeles 
besought her to come out to that genial clime 
and spend her remaining days with him, for 
now he was quite alone. 

Hilda made all preparations. Such of the 
furniture as had intrinsic value was to be 
stored with a friend, the rest sold. And then 
Mrs. Armitage had an unlooked for relapse 
and Hilda went out alone. 

Her uncle was a kindly man past middle 
life and he took an instant fancy to Hilda. 





The house and its surroundings were loveli- 
ness itself. Life here would be really en- 
chanting. It was such a beautiful world. 

‘But you have not seen half of it yet. 
Hilda, what would you say to going abroad? 
I 've wanted to haK my life. But my wife, 
as you have heard, was an invalid and not 
inclined to travel. We lost our two children. 
I'm not too old to start out now and view 
some things with the eyes of an enthusiastic 
young girl.” 

So abroad they went. She had seven years 
of the richness of the old world, learning 
languages, listening to music that stirred 
every pulse of her soul, haunting art gal- 
leries with loving companionship that some- 
how saw the best and most beautiful in every- 
thing if it was not always high art. 

And then she returned alone. It seemed 
more of a loss than the death of her mother. 
She remained awhile in California settling 
up some business and then the longing seized 
her to return to the home of her youth, to have 
a real home where she could make the center 
she was still dreaming of, surround herself 
with friends and do something worth while 
with her money. 




Newton had changed as well, enlarged its 
boundaries and made itself beautiful at the 
northern end. The shops and factories were 
kept down by the railroad center where 
two important lines crossed, and the river 
was navigable. Then Main Street was de- 
voted to really fine stores, Brandon to offices 
and men’s businesses, the Postoffice being 
there. A handsome library building adorned 
Broadway, there were Orphan Homes, an 
Old Ladies’ Home, a Social Settlement. 

Miss Armitage liked the aspect of it. 
Boarding at a hotel for awhile she looked 
about and decided on Loraine place. The 
houses stood in a row, but they had a pretty 
court yard in front, and a real stretch of 
ground at the back for grass and flowers and 
two fine fruit trees. 

Of course old friends sought her out. Per- 
haps the fortune helped. The young girls 
of her time were matrons with growing children. 
How odd it seemed! She thought some- 
times that she felt reprehensibly young, as 
if she was having girlhood over again in her 
heart, but it was a richer, wiser and more 
fervent girlhood, with the added experiences 
of the woman. 





There were many things for her to take 
an interest in but they finally settled around 
the babies and little children's hospital, and 
the Settlement House. In a way, she was 
fond of the sweet, helpless babies who seemed 
so very dependent on human kindness. If 
there was one of her own flesh and blood it 
would take possession of her very soul, all 
her thoughts, all her affection. But it should 
have been hers earlier in life. Now she wanted 
companionship. She could not wait for it to 
develop and then find unpleasant traits that 
had come from alien blood. No, she could 
not adopt a baby and wait a dozen years 
to know whether it would satisfy or not. 

She had helped two or three girls to better 
things. One through the last two years of 
High School and who was now teaching. And 
there had been one with a charming voice 
and an attractive face who had been injured 
in a mill and who would never have perfect 
use of her right hand. If she could be trained 
for a singer! 

She and Doctor Richards came to words 
about her. He said plainly she would not 
be worth the money spent upon her. But 



Miss Armitage insisted on spending it a year 
when the girl threw up her friend and joined 
a concert troupe, slipping presently into 
vaudeville where she was a success. 

And out of the dispute came a proffer of 
love and marriage. Alvah Richards had 
begun life at the opposite pole from Miss 
Armitage. There had been a fortune, a love 
for the study of medicine, a degree in Vienna 
and one at Paris. Then most of the fortune 
had been swept away. He returned to Amer- 
ica and some way drifted to Newton. They 
were just starting the hospital and he found 
plenty to do. He could live frugally. To 
help his still poorer fellow creatures in suf- 
fering, to restore them to strength and teach 
them to be useful members of society, or to 
comfort them and make the path easier over 
the river to the other country; this was his 
highest aim. 

Miss Armitage was almost dumb with sur- 
prise. She raised her hand in entreaty. 

"Oh, don’t! don’t,” she cried. ‘It is quite 
impossible; it cannot be. I like you very 
much, but I am not in love. And then ” 

'Then what?” with eager eyes and in- 
cisive voice. 





‘You had a birthday last week. I heard 
you telling it. You are thirty-one.'' 

'Well — ” There was a proud smile on his 
manly face. 

"And when my birthday comes, I shall be 
thirty-six. When you are sixty, rich in ex- 
perience, famous, a real man among men, I 
shall be quite an old woman. No, I shouldn’t 
do it for your sake.” 

"As if a few years made any difference! 
Why you could discount seven years at least. 
Have you been loved so much that you can 
throw away a man’s honest, honorable, tender 
love that will last all his life, that wear it 
as you like, in any stress, you can never wear 
out.” 

"Oh,” she cried. "You have spoiled a 
splendid friendship. I liked you so much, I
have no love to give in return.” 

"Then let us be friends again. I would 
rather have you for a friend than any other 
woman for a wife. I simply will not give you 
up.” 

So the pendulum went on swinging evenly 
between the two points, when Cinderella en- 
tered both lives. 



And now it was Sunday morning and the 
chimes were pealing — "Oh, come all ye faith- 
ful. Marilla listened with a throb of joy, 
though she did not know the words they were 
saying in sweetest melody. Miss Armitage 
came and stood by the cot with a cordial good 
morning. 

Marilla stretched out her hand and glanced 
up with an entreating sort of smile. 

''Was I very bad last night?'’ she asked in 
a wistful tone. 

''Bad? Why — what was it?'’ 

"I 've been thinking it over. Oh, I didn’t 
want to go back to Mrs. Borden. It is so 
lovely and quiet and beautiful here. But it 
is right. I am her bound-out girl, and I was 
glad to go there. You wouldn’t like me to be 
always looking for what was nice and pleasant 
and shirking other things, would you?” 

''Dear.” She stooped and kissed her. She 
had been going over some arguments fitted for 
a child’s understanding, and she was afraid 
of a rather painful time. And the worst to her 
was the fact that she had come to love the 
child and really desired her. 

'The babies, you know, are so fond of me, 





and they are all very good. So I wouldn’t have 
any reason for not staying with them. And 
it will be only five years more, then I shall be 
eighteen. And I thought — ” fiushing daintily, 
"that maybe Jane might marry, and you 
would want some one in her place and if 
it was — me,” rather tremulously — could 
come — I love you so. I’d be your Cinderella 
always. And when I go back it will be like 
the King’s ball — I shall keep thinking how 
lovely it was for you to bring me here instead 
of sending me to a hospital, and it will comfort 
me just as the music did.” 

Miss Armitage bent over and kissed her 
but there were tears in her eyes. She was 
touched with the child’s reasoning that was 
so like heroism. 

"Yes, dear,” she said. "We will think of 
it that way. And if you should be ill at any 
time, I will have you brought here, and you 
shall stop when you take the babies out and 
let me see them, and rest a little.” 

Oh that will be just lovely. You are so 
good,” and she kissed the white hand lying 
on her shoulder. 

Then Jane came in and she had her bath. 



How delightful it was to be rubbed so carefully, 
to have her curly mop brushed. 

ought to dress myself now. Why I'm 
not sick at all only I get tired easily, but I 
am stronger every day." 

The breakfast was so nice. And to be 
waited upon! Marilla gave an inward laugh 
of delight. 

And while Miss Armitage was at church. 
Dr. Richards came and bundled her up, car- 
ried her downstairs and deposited her in the 
buggy. He was very merry, somehow. He 
was going out in the country and, oh, how 
beautiful everything was! There had been a 
shower in the night and the air was full of 
fragrance from the grass, the pines and 
cedars, the orchards, wild flowers, and newly 
cut hay, that had not all been gathered in. 
Children ran about or swung in hammocks. 
Hens were fairly shouting with no regard 
for Sunday. Birds were caroling all sorts of 
joyous tunes and the tree twigs were gaily 
dancing. And here and there such beautiful 
drifts went over the sky, ships, she called them. 
They were going to fairy land — something 
that was not quite heaven, but a lovely place 




for all that. There must be so many lovely 
places in this great world! Over the ocean 
where Miss Armitage had been, and she re- 
called the castles and palaces and beautiful 
woods, and peasants dancing on the green 
and laughing; that she had seen in the port- 
folio of engravings. And the legends she 
had listened to! Oh, if she could go to school 
and learn ever so many things now, for when 
she was eighteen she would be too old, and 
a kind of perplexity settled in her smooth 
forehead. 



Dr. Richards had been studying the changes 
in the child's face. It was like reading a book, 
but it had many variations. Her thoughts 
must have traveled far and wide. What were 
they? 

"Are you very happy?” he asked. 

"Happy?” she echoed, wonderingly. "Why 
it is a beautiful Sunday. One ought to be 
happy — here with you and watching all these 
lovely things.” 

"Are Sundays happier than any other 
days?” 

"Well — ” slowly. "They ought to be. 
It seems as if it was the day of the Sun, and 
that’s always glad and merry.” 

"But when it rains or is cloudy?” 

'Oh, you know it is there, and maybe He 
is fighting away the clouds. And He draws 
up the water. I read that in a book — and 
when He gets enough He lets it fall down as He 


did last night and that makes the world so fresh 
and sweet. And there are fifty-two Sundays 

when you ought not 

What?’’ watching the shadow in her eyes. 

"Well, I think you ought not work very 
much. I suppose some people have to when 
you have meals to get and babies to see to. 
I go to Sunday school with Jack and I like 
it so much. I’ve learned ever so many of 
the songs. But the lessons puzzle me. They 
are about God — we had them in the Home, you 
know, and God seems so big and strange. Do 
you know all about him.” 

'No, child, and no one, not even ministers 
can know all, so you need not worry about 
that. God has the whole world in His 
keeping. Don’t you like the week days?” 

''Well, they don’t seem to have the same 
joy in them, only at Miss Armitage’s every 
day seems like Sunday. But I keep counting 
them. You see. I’ll be thirteen in September. 
Then when we’ve had fifty-two Sundays I’ll 
be fourteen and so on, until I am eighteen.” 

"And then?” in a sweet kind of tone. 

“Why I won’t be bound-out any more. It’s 
right for me to stay, she said so, but it would 



seem such a long while if I was just counting 
the years. And Sunday comes so quick, 
most times, and then you can be glad.’
What a touch of philosophy for a child! 
''But — they are good to you at Bordens?’
"Oh, yes. I love Bridget, though I was 
afraid of her at first. But the grown people 
have each other and since I don’t really 
belong to them — oh, I can’t explain it,” 
and the knot came back to her brow. 
"You see when you’re bound-out and going 
away for a while they can’t feel the same 
to you. They’re never real cross and they 
don’t whip you as they did at the Home, and 
you have nicer things to eat. Sometimes 
when you were awful hungry you didn’t 
seem to get enough. You wanted one more 
piece of bread, but you couldn’t have it. 
Oh, I like it so much better at Mrs. Borden’s 
Only Jack — Are boys always bad?” 

"I guess they are for the most part,” 
laughing. 

"But he will go to school again. And his 
father says he will outgrow it. His father 
truly does want him to be good, and he said 
I must tell when he pinched me or kicked me, 





and he would punish him. But I don’t like 
to, always, for he denies it, and his mother 
isn’t pleased when I do. You can feel when 
people do not like you to tell things. At 
the Home when you told tales they whipped 
the child that was bad, and then they whipped 
you for telling tales. It didn’t seem as if 
that was quite fair, so I tried never to tell 
on anyone.” 

"Generally speaking, it is a bad habit,” 
he commented, gravely. 

Then they had reached their destination. 
A poor old paralyzed man sat in a wheeling 
chair on the porch. Medical skill could not 
do much for him, but friendship and interest 
made pleasant times to remember when the 
hours were long and weary. Dr. Richards 
had brought some illustrated magazines, and 
they talked over the happenings of the week. 

A sweet-faced, rather elderly lady brought 
Marilla a rocking chair, and asked her if she 
was the doctor’s patient. Then she offered 
her a piece of cake and a lovely pear, and after- 
ward took her down to see the flower garden 
that was fairly rioting in beauty, and a flock 
of snowy white chickens, as well as some fine 


pigeons that circled around like swallows. 
She was the wife, and there was a daughter 
who had gone to church. She talked of Dr. 
Richards, how good and comforting he was 
to father.’’ Marilla thought he must be 
good to everybody. 

"I 've had a lovely time with you,’’ the child 
said. Then she shook hands with 'father,” 
who said — 

s’pose you’re the doctor’s little girl?” 
His mind was not always clear on some points. 
"Come again, won’t you?” 

She smiled and nodded. "The doctor’s 
little girl,” how sweet it sounded! But of 
course that could not be. 

They had a delightful ride home though it 
was growing warmer. How beautiful her 
eyes were today — a sort of gray-violet, and 
the bronze lashes almost curled. And as he 
listened to her soft, flowing voice, he kept 
thinking — if he was to marry some one and 
have a little girl full of quaint ideas as this 
one was! But it would take a long, long 
while, and he sighed. 

Miss Armitage was sitting by the parlor 
window when they returned, and she came to 
the door to meet them. 




ran away with your little invalid,' 
the doctor exclaimed. "Haven’t I brought her 
back improved?” 

Her cheeks were positively rosy and were 
rounded out by the exquisite shading. She 
clasped her small arms around Miss Armitage. 

"And I 've had the most splendid time! A 
real Sunday. WeVe been out in the beautiful 
country where birds were singing hymns and 
I'm just full of happiness.” 

They had kept their pact, these two people 5 
they could not have worked together other- 
wise, and each one was following the same 
path, for the good of the poor of this world, 
am very glad ” 

"Then you are not going to scold me?” with 
a questioning smile. “I promised her a 
drive you know, and today was rather a 
holiday to me.” 

"Why, she doesn't scold,” cried Marilla 
in a sort of joyful contradiction. 

“Won't you come in and have some dinner 
with us?” 

'Tete would grumble if he stood here an 
hour. Now, if you would change it to supper — 
and a cup of tea ” 



"Let be a cup of tea, then. I want to talk 
over some plans. 

"Very well. Expect me on the mark. Six, 
isn’t it?” 

"Yes,” with a smile. 

"Oh, I’m just delighted,” and Manila 
squeezed his hand. 

"So you had a lovely time. Where did 
you go?” 

"Oh — through the park and then out on 
such a beautiful road. Things seem nicer 
on Sunday, because there isn’t so much noise. 
And there was an old man who has to get 
about in a chair with little wheels, and can’t 
walk any more. And the lady gave me some 
cake and such a luscious pear, and asked me to 
come again. I just wished that there was 
some little girl from the Home living there.” 

Manila had her face and hands washed, 
and a fresh white frock put on. She was so 
bright and chatty and really charming. But 
after dinner she lay in the Morris chair and 
Miss Armitage read her to sleep. It seemed 
as if she had improved so much in the 
twenty-four hours. 

They had such a genial and charming 




supper, and Miss Armitage played on the 
organ afterward and then talked about the 
girls who were going to the Rest House next 
week. Five of them were very much worn 
out. They would need to stay a full fortnight. 

"And I think one of them needs some medi- 
cal attention. Come to the Settlement and 
see her before she starts. And you know 
I am booked for that Canadian journey with 
the Winslows. I am almost sorry I promised. 
Do you think it would be safe to let the 
child go to the Bordens on Saturday?'' 

'You won't let her go back! She’s is 
worth something better than baby tending.” 

'You shouldn’t have cured her up so soon! 
I don’t exactly see my way clear or I should 
keep her for good and all. I like her very 
much. You may laugh at me about my 
swans being ordinary geese — but we must 
admit the Bordens have the right to her at 
present. And I do not want to make bad 
friends with them, seeing that in law he may 
exact the pound of flesh. They may tire of 
her or she may not be able to stand the babies 
and Jack. I could leave her here with Jane 
or send her to the Home. But she is very 



much resigned to the return. She has a 
curious bit of conscience about it. So it is 
best to let her try again. 

can’t bear the thought of it.” He 
uttered it with vehemence. 

don’t like it much myself. But it 
seems the only way at present. Bridget will 
looks out for her. We can’t accuse them of 
any cruelty or neglect.” 

"And she fairly worships you — fairy god- 
mother.” 

wish I were. I should change the lot of 
more than one Cinderella. Well — we will 
wait and see.” 

Manila came in with a bunch of flowers. 

"Jane said I might pick them for the 
doctor, and the ride was so nice. I shall
