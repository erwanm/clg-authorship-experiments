mind, and so ready for anything. She went with me 
on two of my trips in the War Zone, being only too 
glad of mental distraction; for like all the mothers 
of France she dreads the ring of the door-bell. She 
told me that several times the ladies who worked in 
her ouvroir would come down with beaming faces and 
read extracts from letters just received from their sons 
at the Front, then go home and find a telegram announcing death or shattered limbs. 

Madame Lyon has a hotel on the Boulevard Berthier 
and before her husband's death was famous for her 
political breakfasts, which were also graced by men 
and women distinguishing themselves in the arts. 
These breakfasts have not been renewed, but I met at 
tea there a number of the political women. One of 
these was Madame Ribot, wife of the present Premier. 
She is a very tail, thin, fashionable looking woman, 
and before she had finished the formalities with her 
hostess (and these formalities do take so long!) I 
knew her to be an American. She spoke French as 
fluently as Madame Lyon, but the accent, however 
faint — or was it a mere intonation, — was unmistakable. She told me afterward that she had come to 
France as a child and had not been in the United 
States for fifty-two years! 



 

One day Madame Lyon took me to see the ateliers 
of Madame Viviani — in other words, the workshops 
where the convalescents who must become reformes 
are learning new trades and industries under the patronage of the wife of the cabinet minister now best 
known to us. Madame Viviani has something like ten 
or twelve of these ateliers, but after I had seen one or 
two of the same sort of anything in Paris, and listened 
to long conscientious explanations, and walked miles 
in those enormous hospitals (originally, for the most 
part, Lycees) I felt that duplication could not enhance 
my knowledge, and might, indeed, have the sad effect 
of blunting it. 

Madame Lyon said to me more than once: "Ma 
chere, you are without exception, the most impatient 
woman I have ever seen in my life. You no sooner 
enter a place than you want to leave it." She was re- 
ferring at the moment to the hospitals in the War 
Zone, where she would lean on the foot of every bed 
and have a long gossip with the delighted inmate, 
extract the history of his wound, and relate the tale 
of similar wounds, healed by surgery, time and 
patience — while I, having made the tour of the cots, 
either opened and shut the door significantly, or 
walked up and down impatiently, occasionally muttering in her ear. 

The truth of the matter was that I had long since 
cultivated the habit of registering definite impressions 
in a flash, and after a tour of the cots, which took 
about seven minutes, could have told her the nature 




of every wound. Moreover, I knew the men did not 
want to talk to me, and I felt impertinent hanging 
round. 

But all this was incomprehensible to a French- 
woman, to whom time is nothing, and who knows how 
the French in any conditions love to talk. 

However, to return to Madame Viviani. 

After one futile attempt, when I got lost, I met 
Madame Lyon and her distinguished but patient friend 
out in one of the purlieus of Paris where the Lycee of 
Arts and Crafts has been turned into a hospital for 
convalescents. 

Under the direction of a doctor each convalescent 
was working at what his affected muscles most needed 
or could stand. Those that ran sewing-machines exercised their legs. Those that made toys and cut 
wood with the electric machines got a certain amount 
of arm exercise. The sewing-machine experts had 
already made fifty thousand sacks for sand fortifications and breastworks. 

From this enormous Lycee (which cost, I was told, 
five million francs) we drove to the Salpetriere, which 
in the remote ages before the war, was an old people's 
home. Its extent, comprising, as it does, court after 
court, gardens, masses of buildings which loom beyond and yet beyond, not only inspired awed reflections 
of the number of old that must need charity in Paris 
but made one wonder where they were at the present 
moment, now that the Salpetriere had been turned into 



 

a hospital. Perhaps, being very old, they had conveniently died. 

Here the men made wooden shoes with leather tops, 
for the trenches, cigarette packages, ingenious toys — 
the airships and motor ambulances were the most 
striking; baskets, chairs, lace. 

The rooms I visited were in charge of an English 
infirmiere and were fairly well aired. Some of the 
men would soon be well enough to go back to the 
Front and were merely given occupation during their 
convalescence. But in the main the object is to prepare 
the unfortunates known as reformes for the future. 

Since the fighting on the Somme began Madame 
Lyon has gone several times a month to the recaptured 
towns, in charge of train-loads of installations for the. 
looted homes of the wretched people. In one entire 
village the Germans had left just one saucepan. Nothing else whatever. 



XIII 

BRIEF ACCOUNTS OF GREAT WORK 

The Duchesse D'Uzes 

THE Duchesse d'Uzes (jeune) was not only one 
of the reigning beauties of Paris before the war 
but one of its best-dressed women; nor had she ever 
been avoided for too serious tendencies. She went to 
work the day war began and she has never ceased to 
work since. She has started something like seventeen 
hospitals both at the French front and in Saloniki, and 
her tireless brain has to its credit several notable inventions for moving field hospitals. 

Near Amiens is the most beautiful of the due's 
castles, Lucheux, built in the eleventh century. This 
she turned into a hospital during the first battle of 
the Somme in 191 5, and as it could only accommodate 
a limited number she had hospital tents erected in 
the park. Seven hundred were cared for there. 
Lucheux is now a hospital for officers. 

She herself is an infirmiere major and not only goes 
back and forth constantly to the hospitals in which she 
is interested, particularly Lucheux, but sometimes 
nurses day and night. 

I was very anxious to see Lucheux, as well as Arras, 



which is not far from Amiens, and, a vast ruin, is 
said to be by moonlight the most beautiful sight on 
earth. We both besieged the War Office. But in vain. 
The great Battle of the Somme had just begun. They 
are so polite at the Ministere de la Guerre! If I had 
only thought of it a month earlier. Or if I could remain in France a month or two longer ? But helas ! 
They could not take the responsibility of letting an 
American woman go so close to the big guns. And 
so forth. It was sad enough that the duchess risked 
her life, took it in her hand, in fact, every time she 
visited the chateau, but as a Frenchwoman, whose 
work was of such value to France, it was their duty 
to assist her in the fulfillment of her own duty to her 
country. Naturally her suggestion to take me on her 
passport as an infirmiere was received with a smile. 
So I must see Arras with a million other tourists after 
the war. 

The duchess prefers for reasons of her own to 
work, not with the noblesse division of the Red Cross, 
but with the Union des Femmes de France. As she 
is extremely independent, impatient, and enterprising, 
with a haughty disdain of red tape, the reasons for 
this uncommon secession may be left to the reader. 

And if she is to-day one of the most valued of the 
Ministere de la Guerre's cooperators, she has on the 
other hand reason to be grateful for the incessant demands upon her mind, for her anxieties have been 
great — no doubt are still. Not only is the due at the 
front, but one of two young nephews who lived with 



 

her was killed last summer, and the other, a young 
aviator, who was just recovering from typhoid when I 
was there, was ill-concealing his impatience to return 
to the Front. Her son, a boy of seventeen — a volunteer of course — in the sudden and secret transfers the 
army authorities are always making, sometimes could 
not communicate with her for a fortnight at a time, and 
meanwhile she did not know whether he was alive or 
"missing." Since then he has suffered one of those 
cruel misfortunes which, in this war, seem to be reserved for the young and gallant. She writes of it 
in that manner both poignant and matter-of-fact that 
is so characteristic of the French mother these days : 

"I have just gone through a great deal of anguish 
on account of my oldest son, who, as I told you, left 
the cavalry to enter the chasseurs a pied at his request. 

"The poor boy was fighting in the splendid (illegi- 
ble) affair, and he was buried twice, then caught by 
the stifling gases, his mask having been torn off. He 
insisted upon remaining at his post, in spite of the 
fact that he was spitting blood. Fortunately a lieutenant passed by and saw him. He gave orders to 
have him carried away. As soon as he reached the 
ambulance he fainted and could only be brought to 
himself with the greatest difficulty. His lungs are better, thank God, but his heart is very weak, and even 
his limbs are affected by the poison. Many weeks 
will be required to cure him. I don't know yet where 
he will be sent to be attended to, but of course I shall 
accompany him. . . . The due is always in the Somme, 



 

where the bombardment is something dreadful. He 
sleeps in a hut infested with rats. Really it is a beautiful thing to see so much courage and patience among 
men of all ages in this country." 

In the same letter she writes : "I am just about to 
finish my new Front hospital according to the desiderata expressed by our President of the Hygiene 
Commission. I hope it will be accepted as a type of 
the surgical movable ambulances." 

Before it was generally known that Roumania was 
"coming in" she had doctors and nurses for several 
months in France in the summer of 1916 studying all 
the latest devices developed by the French throughout 
this most demanding of all wars. The officials sent 
with them adopted several of the Duchesse d'Uzes' inventions for the movable field hospital. 

She has never sent me the many specific details of 
her work that she promised me, or this article would 
be longer. But, no wonder! What time have those 
women to sit down and write? I often wonder they 
gave me as much time as they did when I was on 
the spot. 

The Duchesse De Rohan 

Before the war society used to dance once a week 
in the red and gold salon of the historic "hotel" of 
the Rohans' in the Faubourg St. Germain, just behind 
the Hotel des Invalides. Here the duchess entertained when she took up her residence there as a bride ; 



 

and, as her love of "the world" never waned, she 
danced on with the inevitable pauses for birth and 
mourning, until her daughters grew up and brought 
to the salon a new generation. But the duchess and 
her own friends continued to dance on a night set 
apart for themselves, and in time all of her daughters, 
but one, married and entertained in their own hotels. 
Her son, who, in due course, became the Due de 
Rohan, also married ; but mothers are not dispossessed 
in France, and the duchess still remained the center 
of attraction at the Hotel de Rohan. 

Until August second, 1914. 

The duchess immediately turned the hotel into a 
hospital. When I arrived last summer it looked as if it 
had been a hospital for ever. All the furniture of the 
first floor had been stored and the immense dining- 
room, the red and gold salon, the reception rooms, all 
the rooms large and small on this floor, in fact, were 
lined with cots. The pictures and tapestries have been 
covered with white linen, four bathrooms have been 
installed, and a large operating and surgical-dressing 
room built as an annex. The hall has been turned into 
a "bureau," with a row of offices presided over by 
Maurice Rostand. 

Behind the hotel is the usual beautiful garden, very 
large and shaded with splendid trees. During fine 
weather there are cots or long chairs under every tree, 
out in the sun, on the veranda; and, after the War 
Zone, these men seemed to me very fortunate. The 
duchess takes in any one sent to her, the Government 



 

paying her one-franc-fifty a day for each. The greater 
part of her own fortune was invested in Brussels. 

She and her daughters and a few of her friends do 
all of the nursing, even the most menial. They wait 
on the table, because it cheers the poilus — who, by the 
way, all beg, as soon as they have been there a few 
days, to be put in the red and gold salon. It keeps 
up their spirits ! Her friends and their friends, if they 
have any in Paris, call constantly and bring them 
cigarettes. Fortunately I was given the hint by the 
Marquise de Talleyrand, who took me the first time, 
and armed myself with one of those long boxes that 
may be carried most conveniently under the arm. 
Otherwise, I should have felt like a superfluous in- 
truder, standing about those big rooms looking at the 
men. In the War Zone where there were often no 
cigarettes, or anything else, to be bought, it was different. The men were only too glad to see a new face. 

The duchess trots about indefatigably, assists at 
every operation, assumes personal charge of infectious cases, takes temperatures, waits on the table, 
and prays all night by the dying. Mr. Van Husen, a 
young American who was helping her at that time, 
told me that if a boy died in the hospital and was a 
devout Catholic, and friendless in Paris, she arranged 
to have a high mass for his funeral service at a church 
in the neighborhood. 

The last time I saw her she was feeling very happy 
because her youngest son, who had been missing for 
several weeks, had suddenly appeared at the hotel and 



 

spent a few days with her. A week later the Due de 
Rohan, one of the most brilliant soldiers in France, 
was killed; and since my return I have heard of the 
death of her youngest. Such is life for the Mothers 
of France to-day. 



Countess Greffulhe 

The Countess Greffulhe (born Princesse de Chimay 
and consequently a Belgian, although no stretch 
of fancy could picture her as anything but a 
Parisian) offered her assistance at once to the Government and corresponded with hundreds of Mayors 
in the provinces in order to have deserted hotels made 
over into hospitals with as little delay as possible. She 
also established a depot to which women could come 
privately and sell their laces, jewels, bibelots, etc. 
Her next enterprise was to form a powerful committee 
which responsible men and women of the allied countries could ask to get up benefits when the need for 
money was pressing. 

Upon one occasion when a British Committee made 
this appeal she induced Russia to send a ballet for a 
single performance; and she also persuaded the manager of the Opera House to open it for a gala performance for another organization. There is a romantic 
flavor about all the countess's work, and just how 
practical it was or how long it was pursued along any 
given line I was unable to learn. 



 

Madame Paquin 

Madame Paquin, better known to Americans, I 
fancy, than any of the great dressmakers of Europe, 
offered her beautiful home in Neuilly to the Government to be used as a hospital, and it had accommodated up to the summer of 1916 eight thousand, 
nine hundred soldiers. 

She also kept all her girls at work from the first. 
As no one ordered a gown for something like eighteen 
months they made garments for the soldiers, or badges 
for the numerous appeal days — we all decorated ourselves, within ten minutes after leaving the house, like 
heroes and heroines on the field, about three times a 
week — and upon one occasion this work involved a 
three months' correspondence with all the Mayors of 
France. It further involved the fastening of ribbons 
and pins (furnished by herself) upon fifteen million 
medallions. Madame Paquin is also on many im- 
portant committees, including "L'Orphelinat des 
Armees," so well known to us. 



Madame Paul Dupuy 

Madame Dupuy was also an American girl, born 
in New York and now married to the owner of 
Le Petit Parisien and son of one of the wealthiest 
men in France. She opened in the first days of the 



 

war an organization which she called "CEuvre du 
Soldat Blesse ou Malade," and from her offices in the 
Hotel de Crillon and her baraque out at the Depot des 
Dons (where we all have warehouses), she supplies 
surgeons at the Front with wheeling-chairs, surgical 
dressings, bed garments, rubber for operating tables, 
instruments, slippers, pillows, blankets, and a hundred 
and one other things that harassed surgeons at the 
Front are always demanding. The ceuvre of the Marquise de Noailles, with which a daughter of Mrs. 
Henry Seligmen, Madame Henri van Heukelom, is 
closely associated, is run on similar lines. 

I have alluded frequently in the course of these 
reminiscences to Madame Dupuy, who was of the 
greatest assistance to me, and more than kind and 
willing. I. wish I could have returned it by collecting 
money for her ceuvre when I returned to New York, 
but I found that Le Bien-fitre du Blesse was all I 
could manage. Moreover, it is impossible to get money 
these days without a powerful committee behind you. 
To go to one wealthy and generous person or another 
as during the first days of the war and ask for a donation for the president of an ceuvre unrepresented in 
this country is out of the question. It is no longer 
done, as the English say. 



XIV 
ONE OF THE MOTHERLESS 

VERSAILLES frames in my memory the most 
tragic of the war-time pictures I collected during my visit to France. That romantic and lovely city 
which has framed in turn the pomp and glory of 
France, the iconic simplicities of Marie Antoinette, the 
odious passions of a French mob, screeching for bread 
and blood, and the creation of a German Empire, will 
for long be associated in my mind with a sad and 
isolated little picture that will find no niche in history, 
but, as a symbol, is as diagnostic as the storming of 
the palace gates in 1789. 

There is a small but powerful ceuvre in Paris, com- 
posed with one exception of Americans devoted to the 
cause of France. It was founded by its treasurer, Mr. 
Frederic Coudert. Mr. August Jaccaci, of New York, 
is President; Mrs. Cooper Hewett, Honorary President; Mrs. Robert Bliss, Vice-President; and the 
Committee consists of the Comtesse de Viel Castel, 
Mrs. Francis G. Shaw, and Mrs. William H. Hill, of 
Boston. It is called "The Franco-American Commit- 
tee for the Protection of the Children of the Frontier." 

This Committee, which in May, 1916, had already 
rescued twelve hundred children, was born of one of 



 

those imperative needs of the moment when the 
French civilians and their American friends, working 
behind the lines, responded to the needs of the unfortunate, with no time for foresight and prospective 
organization. 

In August, 1914, M. Cruppi, a former Minister of 
State, told Mr. Coudert that in the neighborhood of 
Belfort there were about eighty homeless children, 
driven before the first great wind of the war, the battle 
of Metz; separated from their mothers (their fathers 
and big brothers were fighting) they had wandered, 
with other refugees, down below the area of battle 
and were huddled homeless and almost starving in 
and near the distracted town of Belfort. 

Mr. Coudert immediately asked his friends in Paris 
to collect funds, and started with M. Cruppi for Bel- 
fort. There they found not eighty but two hundred 
and five children, shelterless, hungry, some of them 
half imbecile from shock, and all physically disordered. 

To leave any of these wretched waifs behind, when 
Belfort itself might fall at any moment, was out of 
the question, and M. Cruppi and Mr. Coudert crowded 
them all into the military cars allotted by the Govern- 
ment and took them to Paris. Some money had been 
raised. Mr. Coudert cabled to friends in America, 
Mrs. Bliss (wife of the First Secretary of the Amer- 
ican Embassy) and Mrs. Cooper Hewett contributed 
generously, Valentine Thompson gave her help and 
advice for a time, and Madame Pietre, wife of the 



 

sous-prefet of Yvetot, installed the children in an 
old seminary near her home and gave them her personal attention. Later, one hundred were returned to 
their parents and the rest placed in a beautiful chateau 
surrounded by a park. 

Every day of those first terrible weeks of the war 
proved that more and more children must be cared 
for by those whom fortune had so far spared. It was 
then that Mr. Jaccaci renounced all private work and 
interests, and that Mrs. Hill, Mrs. Shaw and the 
Comtesse de Viel Castel volunteered. The organiza- 
tion was formed and christened, Mrs. Bliss provided 
Relief Depots in Paris, and Mr. Coudert returned to 
New York for a brief visit in search of funds. 

During the bombardment of the Belgian and French 
towns these children came into Paris on every train. 
They were tagged like post-office packages, and it was 
as well they were, not only because some were too 
little to know or to pronounce their names correctly, 
but even the older ones were often too dazed to give 
a coherent account of themselves; although the more 
robust quickly recovered. The first thing to do with 
this human flotsam was to wash and disinfect and 
feed it, clip its hair to the skull, and then, having 
burned the rags of arrival, dress it in clean substantial 
clothes. While I was in Paris Mr. Jaccaci and Mrs. 
Hill were meeting these trains ; and, when the smaller 
children arrived frightened and tearful they took 
them in their arms and consoled them all the way to 



 

the Relief Depots. The result was that they needed 
the same treatment as the children. 

It was generally the Cure or the Mayor of the 
bombarded towns that had rounded up each little parentless army and headed it toward Paris. When the 
larger children were themselves again they all told the 
same bitter monotonous stories. Suddenly a rain .of 
shrapnel fell on their village or town. They fled to 
the cellars, perhaps to the one Cave Voutee (a stone 
cellar with vaulted roof) and there herded in inde- 
scribable filth, darkness, fear, hunger for weeks and 
even months at a time. The shelling of a village soon 
stopped, but in the larger towns, strategic points desired of the enemy, the bombarding would be incessant. Mothers, or older children, would venture out 
for food, returning perhaps with enough to keep the 
pale flame of life alive, as often as not falling a 
huddled mass a few feet from the exit of the cellar. 
Mothers died of typhoid, pneumonia, in childbirth; 
others never had reached the cellar with their own 
children in the panic; one way or another these children arrived in Paris in a state of orphanhood, al- 
though later investigations proved them to have been 
hiding close to their mother (and sometimes father; 
for all men are not physically fit for war) by the 
width of a street, in a town where the long roar of 
guns dulled the senses and the affections, and the constant hail of shrapnel precluded all search for anything 
but food. 

Moreover, many families had fled from villages 



 

lying in the path of the advancing hordes to the 
neighboring towns, and there separated, crowding into 
the nearest Caves Voutees. Most of these poor women 
carried a baby and were distraught with fear besides ; 
the older children must cling to the mother's skirts 
or become lost in the melee. 

When one considers that many of these children, in 
Rheims or Verdun, for instance, were in cellars not 
for weeks but for months, without seeing the light 
of day, with their hunger never satisfied, with corpses 
unburied for days until a momentary lull encouraged 
the elders to remove the sand bags at the exit and 
thrust them out, with their refuge rocking constantly 
and their ear-drums splitting with raucous sounds, 
where the stenches were enough to poison what red 
blood they had left and there were no medicines to 
care for the afflicted little bodies, one pities anew those 
mentally afflicted people who assert at automatic 
intervals, "I can't see any difference between the 
cruelty of the British blockade and the German sub- 
marines." The resistant powers of the human body, 
given the bare chance of remaining alive, are little 
short of phenomenal. But then, when Nature com- 
pounded the human frame it was to fling it into a new- 
born world far more difficult to survive than even the 
awful conditions of modern warfare. 

Some of these children were wounded before they 
reached the cellars. In many cases the families remained in their homes until the walls, at first pierced 
by the shrapnel, began to tumble about their ears. 




Then they would run to the homes of friends on 
the other side of. the town, staying there until the 
guns, aided by the air scouts, raked such houses as 
had escaped the first assault. Often there were no 
Caves Voutees in the villages. The mothers cowered 
with their children under the tottering walls or lay 
flat on the ground until the German guns turned elsewhere; then they ran for the nearest town. But during these distracted transfers many received wounds 
whose scars they are likely to carry through life. The 
most seriously wounded were taken to the military 
hospitals, where they either died, or, if merely in need 
of bandages, were quickly turned out to make room 
for some poilu arriving in the everlasting procession 
of stretchers. 

Sometimes, flat on their stomachs, the more curious 
and intelligent of the children watched the shells sailing overhead to drop upon some beautiful villa or 
chateau and transpose it into a heap of stones. Where 
there were English or Americans in these bombarded 
towns, or where the Cures or the Mayors of those 
invaded had not been shot or imprisoned, the children 
were sent as quickly as possible to Paris, the mothers, 
when there were any, only too content to let them go 
and to remain behind and take their chances with the 
shells. 

One little Belgian named Bonduelle, who, with two 
brothers, reached Paris in safety, is very graphic: 
"We are three orphans," he replied in answer to the 
usual questions. "Our uncle and aunt took the place 



 

of our dear parents, so soon taken from us. . . . It 
was towards the evening of Wednesday, 6th Septem- 
ber, 1 9 14, that I was coming back to my uncle's house 
from Ypres, when all at once I heard shrieks and 
yells in the distance. I stopped, for I was like one 
stunned. On hearing behind me, on the highway, German cavalry, I ran into a house where I spent the 
night. I could not close my eyes when I thought of 
the anxiety of my uncle and aunt and of the fate of 
my two small brothers, Michael and Roger. Early 
the following day I rushed to our house. Everybody 
was in the cellar. We shed tears on meeting again. 
I found two of my cousins wounded by a shell which 
had exploded outside our door. Soon another shell 
comes and smashes our house. I was wounded. Dazed 
with fear, my cousin and myself got out through a 
window from the cellar, we ran across fields and 
meadows to another uncle, where the rest of the 
family followed us soon. We remained there the 
whole winter, but what a sad winter! We have not 
taken off our clothes, for at every moment we feared 
to have to run away again. 

"The big guns rumbled very much and the shells 
whistled over our heads. Every one heard : 'So-and- 
so is killed' or 'wounded, by a shell.' 'Such-and-such- 
a-house is ruined by a shell.' 

"After having spent more than seven months in 
incredible fear, my brothers and myself have left the 
village, at the order of the gendarmes, and the Eng- 



 

lish took us to Hazebrouck, from where we went to 
Paris." 

In some cases the parents, or, as was most generally 
the case, the mother, after many terrifying experiences in her village, passed and repassed by the Ger- 
mans, having heard of the relief stations in Paris, sent 
their children, properly tagged, to be cared for in a 
place of comparative safety until the end of the war. 
"Young Bruno Van Wonterghem told his experience in 
characteristically simple words: 

"Towards the evening of September 6th, 1914, the 
Germans arrived at our village with their ammunition. One would have thought the Last Judgment was 
about to begin. All the inhabitants were hiding in 
•their houses. I was hiding in the attic, but, desirous 
to see a German, I was looking through a little window 
:in the roof. Nobody in the house dared to go to bed. 
Jt was already very late when we heard knocks at the 
door of our shop. It was some Germans who wanted 
to buy chocolate. Some paid but the majority did not. 
They left saying, 'Let us kill the French.' The following morning they marched away toward France. 
In the evening one heard already the big guns in the 
distance. 

"Turned out of France the Germans came to St. 
Eloi, where they remained very long. Then they advanced to Ypres. The whole winter I heard the 
rumbling of the big guns, and the whistling of the 
shells. I learned also every day of the sad deaths of 
&he victims of that awful war. I was often very 



 

frightened and I have been very happy to leave for 
France with my companions." 

While I was in Paris the refugee children, of course,, 
were from the invaded districts of France; the Belgian stream had long since ceased. Already twelve 
hundred little victims of the first months of the war, 
both Belgian and French, either had been returned to 
their mothers or relatives by the Franco-American 
Committee, or placed for the educational period of 
their lives in families, convents, or boys' schools. The 
more recent were still in the various colonies established by Mrs. Hill and the other members of the 
Committee, where they received instruction until such 
time as their parents could be found, or some kind 
people were willing to adopt them. 

It was on my first Sunday in Paris that Mr. Jaccaci 
and Mrs. Hill asked me to drive out with them to 
Versailles and visit a sanitorium for the children 
whose primary need was restoration to health. It was 
on the estate of Madame Philip Berard, who had contributed the building, while the entire funds for its 
upkeep, including a trained nurse, were provided by 
Mrs. Bliss. 

Versailles was as green and peaceful as if a few 
miles away the shells were not ripping up a field a 
shot. After lunch in the famous hotel ordinarily one 
of the gayest in France at that time of the year, we 
first visited the rest hospital of Miss Morgan, Miss 
Marbury and Miss de Wolfe, and then drove out into 
the country to Madame Berard's historical estate. 



 

Here, in the courtyard of a good-sized building, we 
were greeted by about forty children in pink-and- 
white gingham aprons, and heads either shaved or 
finished off with tightly braided pigtails. It seemed 
to me then that they were all smiling, and — for they 
had been there some weeks — that most of them looked 
round and healthy. But I soon found that some were 
still too languid to play. One lying in a long chair 
on the terrace at the back of the house and gazing 
vacantly out at the beautiful woods was tubercular, 
the victim of months in a damp cellar. Another, al- 
though so excessively cheerful that I suspect she was 
not "all there" was also confined to a long chair, with 
a hip affection of some sort, but she was much petted, 
and surrounded by all the little luxuries that the victims of her smile had remembered to send her. One 
beautiful child had the rickets, and several suffered 
from intestinal prolapsus and other internal complaints, but were on the road to recovery. 

While their Swedish nurse was putting them 
through their gymnastic exercises I studied their faces. 
At first my impression was one of prevailing homeliness; scrubbed, flat, peasant faces, for the most part, 
without the features or the mental apparatus that provides expression. But soon I singled out two or three 
pretty and engaging children, and rarely one whose 
face was devoid of character. And they stood well 
and went through their exercises with precision and 
vigor. 

It was just before we left that my wandering attention was directed toward the scene to which I alluded 
in my first paragraph. The greater number of the 
children were shouting at play in a neighboring field. 
The preternaturally happy invalid was smiling at the 
lovely woods beyond the terrace, woods where little 
princes had frolicked, and older princes had wooed 
and won. Mr. Jaccaci was still petting the beautiful 
little boy who looked like the bambino on the cele- 
brated fresco of Florence; Mrs. Hill was kissing and 
hugging several little girls who had clung to her skirts. 
It was, in spite of its origin, a happy scene. 

I had been waiting by the door for these ceremonies 
of affection to finish, when I happened to glance at 
the far end of the wide stone terrace. There, by the 
balustrade, in the shadow of the leafy woods, stood 
a girl of perhaps eight or ten. Her arms hung at her 
sides and she was staring straight before her while she 
cried as I never have seen a child cry ; silently, bitterly, 
with her heavy plain face hardly twisted in its tragic 
silent woe. 

I called Mrs. Hill's attention to her, for I, a stranger, 
could not intrude upon a grief like that, and the idol 
of all those children immediately ran over to the desolate figure. She questioned her, she put her arms; 
about her. She might as well have addressed one of 
the broken stone nymphs in the woods. That young 
mind, startled from the present, it may be, by witnessing the endearments lavished upon prettier and smaller 
children, had traveled far. She was in the past, a 
past that anteceded even that past of death and thundering guns and rocking walls and empty stomachs; 
a past when the war, of whose like she had never 
heard, was still in the sleepless brains of the monster 
criminals of history, when she lived in a home in a 
quiet village with the fields beyond; where she had a 
mother, a father, sisters, brothers; where her tears 
liad been over childish disappointments, and her 
another had dried them. Small and homely and insignificant she stood there in her tragic detachment the 
symbol of all the woe of France, and of the depraved 
brutality of a handful of ambitious men who had 
broken the heart of the world. 



XV 
THE MARRAINES 

IT is hardly too much to say that every woman in 
France, from noblesse to peasant, has her filleul 
(godson) in the trenches; in many cases, when she 
still has a considerable income in spite of taxes, 
moratoriums, and all the rest of it, she is a marraine 
on the grand scale and has several hundred. Children have their filleul, correspond with him, send hint 
little presents several times a month and weep bitterly 
when word comes that he is deep in his last trench. 

Servants save their wages so that when the filleuls- 
of their mistresses come home on their six days' leave 
they at least can provide the afternoon wine and entertain them royally in the kitchen. Old maids, still'' 
sewing in their attic for a few sous a day, have found' 
a gleam of brightness for the first time in their somber 
lives in the knowledge that they give a mite of comfort or pleasure to some unknown man, offering his- 
life in the defence of France, and whose letters, sentimental, effusive, playful, almost resign these poor 
stranded women to the crucifixion of their country. 

Busy women like Madame d'Andigne sit up until 
two in the morning writing to their grateful filleuls. 
Girls, who once dreamed only of marrying and living- 




 

the brilliant life of the femme du monde spend hours 
daily not only on cheerful letters, but knitting, sewing, embroidering, purchasing for humble men who 
will mean nothing to their future, beyond the growth 
of spirit they unconsciously induced. Poor women 
far from Paris, where, at least, thousands of these 
permissionnaires linger for a few hours on their way 
home, toil all night over their letters to men for whom 
they conceive a profound sentiment but never can 
hope to see. Shop girls save their wages and lady's 
maids pilfer in a noble cause. 

It was Madame Berard (who was a Miss Dana of 
Bostdn) who organized this magnificent spirit into a 
great ceuvre, so that thousands of men could be made 
happy whom no kindly woman so far had been able 
to discover. 

Madame Berard, who has three sons in the army 
herself, nursed at the Front for several months after 
the war broke out. Even officers told her that they 
used to go off by themselves and cry because they 
never received a letter, or any sort of reminder that 
they were anything but part of a machine defending 
France. These officers, of course, were from the invaded district, and in addition to tl^eir isolation, were 
haunted by fears for their women now in the power 
of men who were as cruel as they were sensual and 
degenerate. 

When she returned to her home she immediately 
entered upon the career of marraine, corresponding 
with several hundred of the men she either had known 



 

or whose names were given to her by their commanding officers. Naturally the work progressed beyond her capacity and she called upon friends to help 
her out. Out of this initial and purely personal devotion grew the great ceuvre, Mon Soldat, which has 
met with such a warm response in this country. 

Madame Berard's headquarters are in a villa in 
the Pare Monceau. Here is conducted all the correspondence with the agents in other cities, here come 
thousands of letters and presents by every mail to be 
forwarded to the Front, and here come the grateful — 
and hopeful — permissionnaires, who never depart 
without a present and sometimes leave one, generally 
an ingenious trinket made in the trenches. 

When I visited the villa last summer the ceuvre had 
eight thousand marraines, and no doubt the number 
has doubled to-day. Fifteen hundred of these were 
American, marshalled by Madame Berard's representative in New York, Mr. R. W. Neeser. Some of 
these fairy godmothers had ten filleuls. Packages 
were dispatched to the Front every week. Women 
that could not afford presents wrote regularly. There 
were at that time over twenty thousand filleuls. 

The letters received from these men of all grades 
must be a source of psychologic as well as sympathetic interest to the more intelligent marraines, for 
when the men live long enough they reveal much of 
their native characteristics between the formalities so 
dear to the French. But too many of them write but 
•one letter, and sometimes they do not finish that.
