 

" If I'm not mistaken, it was the wife of Ellis 
Granger," I returned. " He 's been going to the 
dogs for a year, as we know, and about as fast as the 
devil wants him. I heard some young fellows talk 
ing about him at the theatre the other night, and 
they said his wife was almost distressed to death 
about him, and that her friends were afraid she 'd 
lose her mind. They 've only been married a couple 
of years." 

" And you think it was her ?" Lloyd queried, the 
look of suspense and fear beginning to pass from his 
face. 

" I'm almost sure of it," I replied. 

" Where have you seen her?" 

" At the theatre with her husband. She 's one of 
the handsomest women I ever saw, or was some 
time ago, but has changed so much of late that 
you 'd hardly know her as the same person. Gran 
ger is breaking her heart, so they say." 

" But I can t understand what should bring her 
down here at this hour and on such a night," said 
Lloyd. 

" Nor I, except on the theory that she is out of 
her head," I replied. 

" I don 't  like the look of it." 

The fear and anxiety came back into Lloyd 's 
face. Then, after seeming to debate with himself 
for a while, he stooped and took from a closet 
under the counter his overcoat, and as he drew it 
on said, 





" I must see who it is. She might perish in the 
cold and snow." 

He went out hastily, much to my surprise, for 
Tom Lloyd was not given to caring for other people. 
If the woman, whoever she was, had come in and 
said or done anything he didn 't care to have said or 
done, he would have turned her out into the wild 
storm, unless hindered from doing so, with as little 
feeling as if she were a brute, so hardened had he 
become in the few years we had kept this tavern 
together. 

He came back in about ten minutes, stamping 
the snow from his boots and shaking it from his 
clothes. The sober look was still on his face. 

" Did you find her?" I asked. 

He shook his head, and then, in a half-dogged 
sort of way, went slowly back to his place behind 
the bar. 

" Who do you think it was, Tom ?" I asked. 

I saw the muscles of his face quiver a little. 

" No idea in the world," he answered, with the 
tone of one who would be glad to push the whole 
thing out of his mind. 

The day had been unusually cold and boisterous. 
Toward evening it moderated a little, and the snow 
began to fall not in large soft flakes, but in fine 
grains almost as hard as hail. The wind kept high, 
and blew the snow about in blinding gusts. 

The streets were almost deserted until a little after 
nightfall, when men of business, workmen, clerks, 



 

factory and store hands began hurrying home 
ward, some packing themselves into the over 
crowded cars, and others bending to the storm, that 
almost took the breath away in its wilder eddies. 

And now business, which had been dull for some 
hours, grew brisk again. As the men poured forth 
at six o clock from the bindery and printing-office, 
a larger number than usual came in for something 
warm to fortify themselves against the bitter cold 
they were to encounter on their way homeward. 
Most of them took spirits instead of beer. For 
nearly half an hour Lloyd, myself and our bar 
tender were kept as busy as bees. 

Then came a lull, and our rooms were nearly 
empty of guests. 

" We shall have a poor evening, I'm afraid," said 
Lloyd. 

" Yes," I replied ; " a man 's home must be dreary 
enough if he doesn 't prefer staying there to going 
out to-night. We shall miss the faces of some of 
our friends." 

" Some, I'm thinking, that we 'd like to miss alto 
gether," said Lloyd. "There 's old Jacobs, the 
pressman. I dread to see his face. He 's sure to 
get up a row with some body. A glass or two 
makes him as snappish as a cur." 

" I 'd rather see him a dozen times over than 
Ashley 's son," I replied. "That boy 's going to 
ruin as fast as the devil can carry him." 

"I wouldn t, then," was returned. "John 's a 





good-natured, quiet fellow, and never gets into 
trouble with any one. He is a little wild and fast, 
it is true, but he 'll grow out of that." 

" I wish I could be sure of it ; but when a young 
man under twenty gets switched off the track, ten 
to one against his ever getting on again. That 's my 
observation." 

" It isn 't mine, then," said Lloyd. " I can point 
you to a dozen steady family-men who were once 
among the wildest young fellows I ever saw." 

" A great deal depends on character and tempera 
ment," was my reply. " In the case of John Ashley, 
a weak, good-natured, social boy we can hardly 
call him a man the chances are all against him." 

" I shouldn 't wonder if they were," returned Lloyd, 
in a tone of indifference. " But that 's none of our 
business." 

" I'm afraid we shall have trouble with his father 
yet," I remarked. 

" His father go to !" said Lloyd, angrily. 

"What can he do? Let him keep his son at 
home." 

" That is more easily said than done, I imagine. 
You can t keep a fellow at his age in leading-strings. 
But he is a minor." 

"Well, what of that?" 

" The law against selling liquor to minors is an 
ugly one. I don 't  like it." 

" Law !" A derisive laugh rang through the bar 
room. " I'm not afraid of liquor laws. They 've 


all got a loophole. Our friends in the Legislature 
know how to manage that business." 

"But if one should happen to get tripped, it 
wouldn 't be so pleasant to be fined and jugged. 
There 's a good deal of stir among these confounded 
temperance men just now," I replied. 

" Oh, well, they 'll only kick up a little dust. It 
won t amount to anything." 

" Maybe not ; still, I don 't  altogether like the look 
of things. Did you see the judge 's charge to the 
grand jury yesterday?" 

" No." 

" It is nearly all about us liquor-sellers." 

"Indeed?" 

" Just so. Here it is ;" and I took an afternoon 
paper and read : 

" Gentlemen of the grand jury : There are two 
matters to which I wish particularly to call your 
attention at this time, viz. : First. To the flagrant 
violations of the law respecting the sale of intox 
icating liquors." 

"That doesn 't mean us," said Lloyd; "we pay 
our license we are law-abiding." 

" We shall see ;" and I read on : 

"The grand jury for the December session, in 
their presentment of Saturday last, have uttered the 
following emphatic language : 

" The jury would state that seven-eighths of 
all the cases of assault and battery brought before 
us can be traced to the too free use of intoxicating 



liquors, and would most earnestly recommend a more 
stringent enforcement of the license laws. 

" Besides the mischiefs which inevitably flow from 
the licensed sale of liquors, the evils which follow 
the unlawful traffic in liquors are of great magnitude, 
and require the stern application of law to them to 
suppress them. That you may be informed what is 
prohibited by law respecting the sale of liquors, I 
propose to give you a summary of the law on that 
subject. " 

" That 'll do ; you needn 't read any more of his 
stuff. We pay our license ;" and Lloyd waved his 
hand impatiently. 

" There 's something here about minors and drunk 
ards an extract from the law the judge speaks of. 
I guess you 'd better hear it." 

Lloyd bent his head to listen, and I went on : 

" Willfully furnishing intoxicating drinks, by sale, 
gift or otherwise, to any person of known intemperate habits, to a minor or to an insane person, for 
use as a beverage, shall be held and deemed a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, the offender 
shall be fined not less than ten nor more than fifty 
dollars, and undergo an imprisonment of not less 
than ten nor more than sixty days ; and the willful 
furnishing of intoxicating drinks as a beverage to any 
person when drunk or intoxicated shall be deemed 
a misdemeanor, punishable as aforesaid." 

" It doesn 't amount to anything," was Lloyd 's reply. "The judge only spread himself a little to 



 

gain popularity with the temperance men. As to 
grand-jury presentments, they never come to any 
thing." 

" I guess the judge was about of your opinion," 
said I, " for toward the end of his charge he lets the 
cat out of the bag. Hear what he says ;" and I 
read: 

" Unfortunately, we are too much accustomed to 
consider that laws will execute themselves, or that 
the officers of the law should become public prose 
cutors, and too little attention is given by our citi 
zens generally to the enforcement of the laws and the 
punishment of wrong-doers. In a republican gov 
ernment every citizen has a direct interest in the 
enforcement of the laws, and if a greater interest 
were manifest in their enforcement, our republican 
institutions would not be so often brought into 
question. " 

" Just so : what 's everybody 's business is nobody 's 
business," replied Lloyd. 

A fiercer blast than usual sent the fine, sand-like 
snow in a pelting gust against the window. In the 
pause that followed I heard a child 's voice outside. 
Then the door was pushed slowly open and two little 
figures glided in, white with snow a bright-eyed 
Italian boy not over ten years of age, and his sister, 
who was still younger. The boy had a violin and 
the girl a tambourine. They were shivering with 
cold. 

" Off with you ! Off with you !" cried Lloyd, advancing toward the children and waving his hand 
toward the door. 

The girl looked frightened, but the boy stood his 
ground. 

" I wouldn 't turn a dog out on a night like this," 
spoke up a man who had come in a short time be 
fore, and was now sitting at a table reading and en 
joying his glass of hot whisky punch. 

Lloyd felt the rebuke, and returned to the bar. 
The children came forward, and, after shaking the 
snow from their poor garments, began warming their 
half-frozen hands at the stove. There was a pinched, 
hungry look in the girl 's face, and something so wist 
ful in her large, black, Italian eyes that I was moved 
to pity. 

So I came round from the bar and said a kind 
word. It was as if a sunbeam had fallen on the 
child 's face, it brightened so suddenly. 

" Hungry ?" I asked. 

She nodded her head in reply, looking pleased but 
eager. 

I took the two children into a back room, and gave 
them each some bread and cheese and a small glass 
of beer. 

"You re a great fool," growled Lloyd. "We 'll 
have a hundred of these vagabonds upon us before 
the week 's out." 

" We can deal with them as they come along," I 
replied, with some asperity of tone, for I was 
voked at his utter want of feeling. 


His eyes flashed. He was getting more and more 
irritable every day, and I found it sometimes as 
much as I could do to keep from an open quarrel. 
He drank more of late than usual. For the first 
year or so after we opened the house he indulged 
sparingly, but in the last few months his appetite 
for liquor had grown on him so fast that I began to 
feel concerned the more so, as he was one of the 
men into whom the devil seems to go by the way of 
drink. 

An hour later and customers began to drop in, 
but not as freely as on clear nights. Men with com 
fortable homes, and not too much given to drink, 
preferred keeping indoors to going out on such a 
wild and stormy evening. So, as a rule, we had only 
the hard cases that night customers who must have 
their liquor if they had to go through fire and water 
to get it. 

Old Jacobs the pressman was among the earliest 
of these. Not long after him came John Ashley, the 
foreman 's son, and soon after, Joe Wilson, a young 
man who worked in the bindery, and who, though 
not yet of age, was fast going to ruin. 

By nine o clock we had in about a dozen men and 
lads, half of whom were up stairs in private rooms, 
playing cards, singing songs or in other ways amus 
ing themselves, and every now and then ordering up 
liquor. 

They were a thirsty set, and made frequent de 
mands on the bar. The tongue of old Jacobs was 





getting oiled by this time, and he was in the midst 
of an argument with another man, and rather an ill- 
looking person, who was a stranger. Now, Jacobs, 
toper as he was, and always as full of beer as a keg, 
had a queer fancy for talking on the side of temper 
ance, and the tipsier he got, the longer and stronger 
he talked, not unfrequently in pressing his case offer 
ing himself as an example and witness of the evil of 
liquor-selling and liquor-drinking. He was, strange 
to say, a real or pretended advocate of prohibition, 
and had a way of putting his argument that bothered 
a good many, silenced some and brought a few over 
to his side. I was always annoyed when he got 
going on this key, for he said a great many hard 
things and a great many true ones. As for Lloyd, 
it was generally as much as I could do to keep him 
quiet. He would have pitched him into the street 
long ago if he had not taken counsel of prudence 
and repressed his quick anger. Jacobs was gen 
erally liked among the men in the printing-office, 
and an indignity to him would have been resented 
to our loss in the loss of custom. So we had to 
bear with him, and our forbearance made him grow 
reckless of speech when the humor was on him. 

"There 's no good in it, sir, no good," I heard 
him say sharply to the stranger in a rising voice. 
" And if I had my way, there wouldn 't be a rum-mill 
in the State." 

" It 's well for some people that you haven t your 
way," said the other, with just a shade of annoyance 



  

in his tone "for our friends over there, for instance;" 
and he waved his hand toward Lloyd and myself. 

" It would be better for some that I could tell of, 
and, if all the truth were known, better for our 
friends over there if they had never seen a beer- 
barrel or toddy-stick. I know. They 've got a pile, 
I 've heard ; and I guess it 's true. Many littles make 
a mickle, as the Scotch say. But there are two 
sides" 

The old pressman stopped in the middle of his 
sentence. A man wrapped in a heavy cloak, white 
with snow, had pushed open the door, and was 
standing just inside. The collar of his cloak cov 
ered his face to his eyes. I thought I knew him, but 
could not clearly make out who he was. He stood like 
a statue for several moments, looking keenly through 
the room, and then, without speaking, went out. 

" Who was that ?" asked one and another. 

" Some poor father seeking in sorrow for a prod 
igal son," said Jacobs. " I 've done it myself. Poor 
boy! But he 's dead now;" and a sob and a 
quiver came into the old man 's voice, half drunk as 
he was. 

"I know," said one who worked in the bindery: 
" it was Ashley. He 's after John." 

"By George! that 's so!" exclaimed Jacobs. "I 
thought I knew him. Hark !" 

And down from one of the rooms above came a 
voice singing, 

" Champagne Charley is my name." 





" That 's his young hopeful," said Jacobs, with a 
half chuckle. " I guess he won t find him. But it 's 
hard;" and his tone changed. "I know. I 've been 
there. I 've traveled that road, and know all about 
it. Tisn 't agreeable, no how you can make it. If I 
was Tom Lloyd and Hiram Jones, I wouldn 't let the 
boy come here. He 's a minor, and it 's risky busi 
ness, you see. The judge put that very thing to the 
grand jury yesterday strong, and I guess that 's 
what 's set Mr. Ashley going. If he 'd pounced down 
on John to-night, there 'd have been some court 
business, maybe, and maybe something else" 

He drew down his mouth in a comical way. A 
laugh went round the room, but neither I nor 
Lloyd enjoyed it very much. 

" As I was saying," resumed old Jacobs, turning 
to the stranger with whom he had been talking, 
" there 's no good in it, and the whole thing ought 
to be stopped." 

" How will you stop it ?" asked the other. 

" By law, sir by law ! It 's the only way," re 
turned the old man, slapping his hand upon the 
table at which he was sitting. 

" Then you 'll never see it stopped," was answered. 
" The people of this country are not going to pass 
laws that interfere with a man 's right to eat and 
drink what he pleases." 

" Of course not," said Jacobs. 

"Then what are you talking about?" asked the 
stranger, with ill-concealed contempt of manner. 
  

"About laws to stop whisky-mills," answered 
Jacobs, sharply. "The law doesn 't say anything 
about my eating bad meat, but it says you sha n t sell 
it. Why? Because bad meat makes people sick. 
So does arsenic, and so does whisky. If the law is 
right in one case, why not in the other ? Can you 
tell me, my fine fellow ?" 

And the excited old man leaned across the table 
and glared at his opponent in a way that must have 
been felt very offensive, for I saw the stranger 's hand 
move nervously, as if he were going to slap him in 
the face. 

" Come, come, Jacobs," said I, in a coaxing voice, 
as I came round to where he was sitting, and laid my 
hand on his shoulder. " Let 's have good-fellowship 
here to-night, and not wrangling." 

" Who 's wrangling, Hiram Jones ? who 's wrang 
ling, I 'd like to know ?" The old man pitched his 
voice to a higher key, and shook off my hand im 
patiently. 

" You re not, of course," I returned, in as pleasant 
a way as I could speak. 

" Who is, then ?" sharply asked the stranger. I. 
looked at him, and saw a devil in his eye a devil 
that I did not care to provoke. Before I could re 
ply, Jacobs turned to him and said, 

" Ha ! my fine fellow. Answer me that ! You 
talk of law ! I 've got more sense in my toe nail than 
you 've got in all your ugly head !" 

I saw the blow coming, but was not quick enough 





to catch or turn it away. In a moment after, old 
Jacobs fell with a heavy jar on the floor, and in the 
next instant his assailant was dropped at his side. I 
thought the men in the bar-room, all of whom knew 
and liked Jacobs, would have killed the man who 
struck him, so furious was their assault upon him. 
While he was struggling with them and showing 
the strength of a giant, but getting dreadfully pun 
ished by kicks and blows on head, face and body, I 
saw him draw a pistol from his pocket and try to 
cock it. Then a sharp crack rang through the room, 
followed by two more in quick succession. 

The stillness of death followed, broken almost in 
stantly by a savage oath from a fellow-workman of 
Jacobs, who kicked the stranger in his side with al 
most the force of a horse 's hoof. I heard the ribs 
crack. The pistol fell from his hand, and he sank 
back with a groan. There was an ashen pallor on 
his face. 

" Is any one hurt ?" ran now from lip to lip. Hap 
pily, the bullets had done no harm. Our next con 
cern was for the man who lay unconscious upon the 
floor with his ribs broken in. 

Work like this is always bad work for saloon and 
tavern-keepers. It brings them into public notice in 
a way they desire to avoid. In most cases of drunken 
rows and violence, the uproar draws in a crowd, ac 
companied by police officers. Arrests are apt to be 
made, and indictments and appearances in court often 
follow. 



On this evening the storm without kept the street 
clear, and no one heard the pistol shot or loud con 
fusion of voices, so we had time to cover up our 
trouble and keep it out of the papers. The man, 
still insensible, was carried up stairs and laid on a 
bed in one of the rooms. After a little while he 
came to, and we learned from him his name and 
residence. He proved to be a man in the wholesale 
liquor trade. His name was Spencer. After con 
sultation it was decided to have him taken to his 
boarding-place that night, which was done, the men 
who had beaten him in anger carrying him through 
the storm in pity. 

As for old Jacobs, he was not seriously hurt, but a 
good deal scared. After taking another glass of ale 
he went home, and at a much earlier hour than 
usual. 



CHAPTER II. 

THE evening had worn on until it was nearly 
ten o clock, the heavy storm continuing. The 
snow, which had fallen to the depth of several 
inches, driven by eddying winds, was piled up in 
some places several feet high. Only a few of the 
men who took Spencer home returned that night, 
and by ten we were nearly deserted. 

Among those who still remained was John Ash 
ley, the foreman 's son, and he had drunk so much 
that he was unable to walk steadily. I was trying 
to persuade him to go home with a journeyman who 
worked under his father in the bindery, and who 
went past his house, when I heard an exclamation 
from Lloyd. It was full of pain and surprise. 

The street door was again pushed ajar by a 
woman 's small white hand. Through the partial 
opening I could see a woman 's face and form, and 
beyond her, made visible by a street lamp, the fast- 
falling snow and its ghostly shroud upon everything. 

Suddenly the door was thrown back, and the 
slender form of a girl, pale as death, stepped a few 
paces inside. Her light, abundant hair had fallen 
over her neck and shoulders, and lay about them 
in wet and tangled masses. 

 



 

" Father ! father ! oh, father ! don 't  do it, father I" 
she cried out in a piteous kind of wail, like one in 
cruel suffering. 

By this time Lloyd had come from behind the 
bar, and was only a few steps from the girl, when, 
looking at him for a moment, she uttered a piercing 
cry, and turning, fled through the door with the 
fleetness of a deer. 

" Stop her !" he cried wildly, " stop her !" I ran 
out, Lloyd following quickly. Just as I reached the 
pavement I saw the flutter of a garment at the cor 
ner of Harvey street, round which it disappeared. I 
sprang forward, but when I reached the corner no 
living form was visible. I ran to the next corner, 
but saw no one. As I turned from the baffled pur 
suit, Lloyd came up, bareheaded, as I was, and said 
huskily, 

" My God ! it 's Maggy ! What does it mean ?" 
The name of God was often on his lips, but never 
with the solemnity, anguish and sense of helpless 
ness with which it was then uttered. " Has she 
gone mad ? Oh, Hiram ! and out in such a night ! 
Did you see which way she went ?" 

" I saw her go like a flash round into Harvey 
street," I replied, " but when I got to the corner she 
was not in sight." 

We ran this way and that for a while, fruitlessly, 
and then returned for our hats and overcoats. Leav 
ing the saloon in charge of our bar-tender, we started 
out again, taking different ways Lloyd, that in the 



 

direction of his home. I asked all the policemen I 
met not many were out that night if they had 
seen anything of a young girl in a waterproof, and 
with only a handkerchief over her head, but could 
gain no intelligence of her. After searching about 
for half an hour, and until I was almost stiff with 
cold, I went back to the saloon, or " The Retreat," 
as it was called. As I turned into Harvey street I 
saw, just a little in advance, some one trying, with 
difficulty, to make head against the storm that beat 
in his face. He staggered from side to side, now 
coming up against the house, and now swaying to 
the curbstone. Just as I reached him his foot 
tripped against something, and he pitched headfore 
most into a bank of snow. I waited for a few 
moments to see if he could recover himself. But 
after a few feeble efforts to rise he lay still with his 
face downward. 

I stooped, and taking his arm, tried to help him 
up, but he lay like a log. 

" Come, come, sit up ! You 'll freeze to death !" 
I said, in a loud, commanding voice, jerking his arm 
at the same time. 

" Oh, it 's you, Hiram ! Well, you needn 't pull a 
fellow 's arm off," growled the prostrate man, in a 
thick, drunken voice. 

It was John Ashley. The poor, weak, good- 
natured fellow had taken a glass too much, and then 
started for home, against his will, as I afterward 
learned. But our bar-keeper, who had a grudge 



 

against him, put him out of the saloon after we left, 
and would not let him come back. So he started 
for home in the blinding storm, and unless I had 
come upon him as I did, he would never, I fear, have 
reached his father 's house. 

Nothing was left for me to do but get him home 
a distance of many blocks as best I could. So I 
raised him by main strength to his feet, and after 
steadying him, said, 

" Come." 

" Come where ?" he asked, not moving a step. 

" Home. I'm going to take you home," I said. 

"I 'll bet you a drink on that!" he mumbled 
thickly, and then broke out in an attempt to sing 
" We won t go home till morning." 

I was in no mood for exercising patience, so I 
put forth my strength and drew him along. After 
his feet got in motion he kept on unresistingly. At 
the next street I hoped to get a car that would take 
us near his residence, but the snow had blocked the 
track, and no car was in sight. I waited for a while, 
when a policeman came up. 

" Are the cars running ?" I asked. 

" No ; they stopped an hour since," he replied, 
then, as he recognized me, added with a laugh, 

" Taking home some of your work, I see." 

"I wish he 'd stay at home," I answered, impa 
tiently. " Guess I 'll have to turn him over to you, 
and let him have a night in the station-house." 

" Who is he ?" asked the policeman. 





" Oh, it 's Ashley 's son," I replied. 

" Not Ashley at the bindery ?" 

" Yes ; and I wish he 'd keep his boy at home." 

" No, sir ; it can t be done !" said the policeman, 
speaking strongly. " John 's got to be taken home. 
I 'll not put that disgrace on his father. You 've made 
him drunk, and now you must take care of him. 
Don 't let him get into a station-house to-night. If 
you do, there 'll be trouble. He 's a minor, under 
stand." 

I did understand, for the judge 's charge to the 
grand jury was still fresh in my memory. 

" You 'll have to give me a lift," said I. 

" There 's no have to about it," he answered. " I'm 
on my beat, and can t go off of it, if I cared to." 

So I had nothing to do but to get the drunken 
boy home as best I could. It took me nearly an 
hour. Two or three times he fell down, when it 
was as much as I could do to lift him up. I was 
completely exhausted and out of temper when we 
reached his father 's house. It was then after eleven 
o clock. A light burned in one of the chambers and 
in the hall. 

He was so stupefied with liquor and cold that he 
could not stand alone, and it was with difficulty I 
got him up the steps. Then I squared him round 
and leaned him with his back against the door, 
saying, in a low voice, 

" Steady, now, John ! Steady !" 

As soon as I had him set firmly, I gave the bell a 

 



 

violent jerk and ran down the steps, waiting a little 
way off to see that he was taken in. In a few 
moments the door was opened, and he fell heavily 
into the vestibule. A mother 's cry of pain and 
terror rang out upon the air. Yes, it was a mother 's 
cry ; my heart told me that. 

I hurried away, the cry ringing in my ears so dis 
tinctly that it seemed to be coming after me, and as 
I went I swore that John Ashley should never enter 
" The Retreat " again. 

And he never did. But I am ahead in my story, 
and must go back a little in order that the reader 
may not only know how I came into this wretched 
business, but something of the characters I have 
brought before him. 



CHAPTER III. 

I WAS earning fifteen dollars a week at my trade 
might have earned twenty if I had worked 
steadily, but would have been no better off, for my 
pockets had holes in them that let everything run 
out. I was not careful of my money, but spent it 
freely, and for the most part foolishly. I was fond of 
company, and that into which I drifted was not al 
ways the best for a young man. Too often the even 
ings found me in a drinking-saloon not that I cared 
much for liquor, but I met good fellows there, and 
passed the time agreeably. 

There worked beside me in the bindery my trade 
was that of a bookbinder a man named Tom Lloyd. 
He was ten or twelve years older than I, and had a 
wife and four children. I was single. Taking one 
week with another, Lloyd 's wages did not reach an 
average of over sixteen dollars, though he could 
easily have earned from eighteen to twenty. Scarcely 
a week passed that he did not lose a day or an after 
noon. He was always complaining about hard work 
and poor pay, and never received his wages on Sat 
urday night without grumbling because the amount 
was so small. He was not what was called a drink- 

 



 

ing man, though he took his glass of beer two or 
three times a day. 

As his pockets were generally empty by Monday 
or Tuesday, he often borrowed of me small sums, to 
be returned on Saturday night. At first these were 
promptly repaid, but after a while only a part was 
made up, and a promise given to square all by the 
next pay-day. He rarely kept his word. 

" Never mind," I usually replied to his half-shame 
faced apologies ; " let it go over another week." 

" I'm so dreadfully poor," he used to say some 
times. " How we are all to keep soul and body to 
gether is more than I can tell. Six mouths to feed ! 
Just think of that!" 

I pitied and forgave him all he owed me whenever 
he talked after this fashion. Six mouths to feed, and 
I had only one, yet Saturday usually found my 
pockets as empty as Tom Lloyd s. 

Mrs. Lloyd was a clever sort of woman, and man 
aged to do a great deal of hard work at home, and 
yet keep herself and house looking tidy. She had 
been very well educated in one of the public schools, 
and was rather intelligent. I liked both herself and 
husband so well that I often called in on Sunday af 
ternoon and took tea with them. 

If Lloyd had worked as faithfully and economized 
as carefully as his wife, their income would have 
been larger, and they would not have heard the wolf 
growling as often as they did. As it was, the signs 
of poverty were beginning to show themselves at 





home in many ways. The furniture and carpets 
were growing old and dingy, and could not be re 
placed, clothing was poor and scant, and every 
thing was getting a sort of pinched look. Mrs. 
Lloyd 's face often wore a dreary, anxious expression. 

And yet Tom Lloyd would drop out a day for
