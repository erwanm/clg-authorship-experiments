"Who wishes you to do so?" said Templyn eagerly. 
" Tour sweetheart shall live, eat, drink, and sleep with my 
dear old lady until we come back. I have no idea of 
dawdling along the old beaten way by the coast. Who 
wants to joggle along on other men's shoulders ! No, my 
dear fellow, on foot ! — on foot," he repeated with a loud 
voice and a confident slap on my shoulder; " please God, 
on our own legs, and right across, high up in the country 
through the tremendous forests of Ceylon, just as you have 
always wished. We will get two or three of the natives to 
join us, take some fellows with us well laden with provis- 
ions and travelling tackle, be well armed with guns 



swords, and pistols, and well see whether hunger or wild 
beasts will attack such fellows as we." 

At this picture the ashes were all blown away from my 
smouldering passion for travelling. All at once it burst 
into fiill flame, and my assent flew over my lips. The 
preparations for the adventurous undertaking Templyn's 
impatience would not suffer to be delayed. They were 
commenced the next day. They did not escape my loving 
wife who, however, regarded the whole thing at first as a 
somewhat extravagant jest, or as a whim which she would 
have little difficulty in laughing us out of Such was her 
impression, until somewhat embarrassed and not without 
the confusion of conscious guilt, I very gravely assured 
her that my word was given and that it was too late to 
draw back. Many ebullitions of love and anger I had to 
endure, but when she found that I was not to be changed, 
her dissatisfaction was turned into anxiety. She let 
nothing be wanting in the way of good counsel, and 
contented herself at last with making me promise to 
provide myself-with a pair of boots, in order that I might 
not be exposed to the bite of venomous reptiles. In my 
neighbor's house also many a lively scene was enacted. 
Frau Templyn, in addition to the reproaches she poured 
upon her good man, had yet something else to lay in the 
scale in his age which little comported with such a mad 
adventure, the consequence of which might be so disas- 
trous to his large family. But the old man was a tough 
piece, who said little, and asserted his authority. The 
worthy woman saw the uselessness of resistance, swallowed 
down her objections, and with my wife, comforted herself 




with the prospect of the quiet time they would have 
together in our absence. 

Still more difficult than the reconciling of our wives 
to our adventure, was the attempt to procure companions 
for the journey. But here fortune favored us. Templyn 
found an old soldier, originally from Strasburg, who had 
wandered to Ceylon as a journeyman baker and cook, an 
honest chap of inexhaustible good humor, incomparable in 
making faces, at the same time a burly fellow in size and 
of unquestionable courage. He had only two faults, 
which indeed rendered him of doubtful value as a travel- 
ling companion ; he was deaf as a post, and such a deter- 
mined friend of all kinds of strong drink, that to be more 
or less drunk was the order of the day with him. We 
had no choice, however, and all things considered, he was 
about as valuable to us as our other companion, a French- 
man of the name of d'Allemand, a man of excessive 
politeness but of no great valor, who, having important 
papers to cany to Colombo, did not dare to attempt the 
journey alone, and so attached himself to us. 

Our arms corresponded to our wants, and were such as 
vrould serve to procure us game for food, and protect us 
from the wild beasts upon which we expected to stumble 
at every step. For the latter purpose we had to make pe- 
culiar preparations against the wild elephants who reigned 
supreme in the forests, and who not rarely assaulted remote 
settlements in immense troops, trampling down the tilled 
fields, and destroying human life. As our hunting arms 
would harldly suffice, and we could not hope to overpower 
fcnes animals, should they take it into their heads to 




attack us, our point was to scare them off; accordingly we 
provided ourselves with a hundred rockets, and a copper 
alarm kettle. To protect ourselves against the men, who 
are oftentimes no less dangerous than the wild heasts, I 
procured from the government a passport, in the native 
language, written on a pahn leaf, directing all whom it 
concerned to provide me Jacob Hafiier, Clerk of the Dutch 
East India Company, and my companions with all needed 
assistance. This kind of official protection is indispensably 
necessary in a country where the oppressed natives hate 
their oppressor, and where every European, who claims 
their hospitality, finds himself poorly off without such a 
pass. 

All our preparations finished, after a moderate mid-day 
meal, we took farewell of our wives not without tears. 
We men bore ourselves stoutly —  father Templyn scolded 
a little ; a sobbing good-bye sounded after us, and so we 
broke away with our company, sixteen in all. Almost the 
whole population of the place turned out to witness the 
commencement of such an unheard of enterprise. To 
speak the truth, we four Europeans looked very much like 
so many highway robbers starting upon an expedition for 
plunder. Three of us were armed with cutiasses, a brace 
of pistols in our belts, cartridge boxes, and rifles over our 
shoulders ; the deaf baker wore a huge sabre, which clat- 
tered behind him as he marched. 

II. 

In order to cut off a good piece of the way to the Dutch
brt, Panoryn, whence we were to start on foot, we crossed 



 

an arm of the sea ; the voyage was short, but not withoutv 
an adventure, for just as the baker was taking a drink of 
rum to our health and a good journey', a flying fish shot 
by so close to his nose that in pure fright he let the glass 
fall to the ground. And his fright was not without reason, 
for the creature, pursued by his enemies, darted out of the 
water as if he had been shot from a bow, and his pike- 
shaped mouth-piece, which was so hard and pointed, like 
the bill of a bird, that it entered an inch or two into the 
ship's flanks, was not a very pleasant thing to come in 
contact with. 

On the third day we reached the fort, and found a right 
hearty welcome from the commandant of the same ; but 
all his well meant efibrts to turn us from our purpose were 
fruitless. As, however, we were approaching the scene 
of danger, we lost no time in putting our arms in order. 
Immediately after dinner we shook hands with our friendly 
host, and turned towards the thick forest which lay spread 
out like a carpet within half a mile of us. A majestic, 
awe-inspiring sight ! especially as imagination suggested 
what a host of blood-thirsty, ravenous wild beasts, with 
strength far exceeding that of man, were hidden behind 
the curtain. 

A dim twilight received us as we entered the skirt of 
the wood between the huge trees, which wove over oui 
heads a dome of branches, variegated ' by flowers, and 
blossoms, and accessible to no ray of the sun. At every 
step, as we entered farther into the forest, the trees mse 
larger and closer, and were so thickly woven together with 
underwood and running vines, that sometimes we were 



unable to proceed a dozen steps without cutting our way, 
axe in hand. It grew every moment more diflBcult, and 
we were heartily glad when one of our attendants, an 
elephant-hunter, who acted as our guide, at last found a 
narrow foot pajih, which we instantly followed. 

I found myself by accident at the head of the march ; 
the Frenchman, with whom I had fallen ioto livelj- chat, 
trotted after me, when suddenly a monstrous bear shot out 
of a bush right before my feet, and stood apparently in 
doubt whether he should attack me or make off. For my 
part I did not see him until he was so near to me that T 
tumbled over his broad back, and we both rolled on the 
ground. The Frenchman was more fortunate, and had 
time to retreat a few steps. I instantly tried to rise, 
either to flee or to defend myself; but before I could get 
upon my feet the monster stood growling over ue, with 
open mouth and raised claws, prepared to at tuck me. 
The frightfid sight struck me motionless with fear, and I 
gave myself up for lost, for, at the slightest movement on 
my part, the outstretched claw would have descended on 
my head; I closed my eyes, and commended my' soul ta 
God. At this critical moment I heard something whizz 
over me, and at the same time a shot was heard, at which 
the startled animal left me, and with a horrible cry darted 
away through the opening whence he had made his appear- 
ance. Thus was I, contrary to all hope, rescued from 
death, and indeed in a double form, for I was not in more 
peril from the uplifted claw of the bear than from the 
pistol ball spnt by the trembling hand of the excited 
d'Allemand, and yet I owed it to this bad shot that I wa» 



 

not torn to piieces, before one of the company, who were 
some distance behind, could render me any help. 

While these, as much astonished as rejoiced, congratu- 
lated me upon having escaped the rough embrace of the 
ehaggy fellow, our baker was doing his, best, with his 
drawn sabre, to find the impudent beast that be believed 
to be still in the neighborhood; but not succeeding, on 
account of the thorns in penetrating the thick and tangled 
underwood, he would fain show us what he considered an 
infallible means of putting the wildest and fiercest animals 
to instant flight. He seized his hat between his teeth, 
crawled on all fours, and, with all sorts of shouts and 
cries, made such comical leaps that we were ready to burst 
with laughing. His nonsense at least helped to restore 
our composure. Besides, this adventure sharpened our 
wits, and we perceived the necessity of redoubled caution 
in pursuing our narrow and crooked path, where we could 
see so little distance ahead. For had an elephant or any 
other wild animal rushed on us, we should have had no 
chance either for defence or escape. We sent on our 
kettle drummer, with some of our armed attendants, a few 
steps , before us, so that we could not easily be taken by 
surprise. 

We proceeded somewhat more orderly; the day was 
beginning to decline, and the thickness of the forest 
increased the darkness ; the cries of wild beasts began to 
be heard, and the spot which our guide proposed for our 
night camp was still distant. We lighted the torches 
which we had procured at Panoryn, and which, being of a 
very resinous wood, rivalled the best wax tapers. The 



 

bright flashes of our torches, connected with the far 
sounding noise of our kettle drum, disturbed the feathered 
inhabitants of the woods, who, startled by the light, flew 
about as if intoxicated, while the monkeys, likewise dis- 
turbed in their sleep, signified their displeasure by ear- 
piercing cries, and by pelting us with leaves and fruits. 
At last, about nine o'clock, we reached, heartily tired, our 
first resting-place — a lonely, ruinous straw hut, in the 
thickest of the forest; but as we knew that several kinds 
of poisonous serpents were wont to take up their abode in 
such old moulding straw, we preferred to encamp round a 
good fire out of doors, where we prepared our supper, and, 
after setting a guard, laid ourselves down to rest. 

Our order of the day remained the same during cur 
whole journey. As soon as daylight appeared we broke 
up our camp, in order that, while we were fresh, we might 
accomplish a good piece of the way. It was indescribably 
agreeable, travelling through those forests in the early 
jnoming — life every where, every where in motion. Apes, 
with their young in their arms, leaped with odd antics 
firom bough to bough ; birds of the most brilliant plumage 
flew in every direction. From millions of throats gushed 
song or cry. Parrots chattered, and beetles and insects 
buzzed monotonously in our ears. We exhaled the most 
rgfireshing air, impregnated with fragrant flowers and 
plants, which pushed themselves up amidst the bushes. 

About noon, as soon as we could find a spot where it 
was somewhat lighter, and the ground was dry, and water 
near, we made halt and spread out our mats, whicb served 
for chairs, tables, and beds. Our attendants took turn in 



 

collecting dry wood to light a fire, while others attended 
to the cooking; the idle slept, sang, smoked, or chattered. 
As soon as dinner was ready we seated ourselves cross- 
legged in groups, and each one placed before him a large 
leaf from the tree that yielded us shade, and received 
upon it his portion of steak and rice. Gay jests and 
laughter seasoned the meal, and the baker acted excel- 
lently his part of a jovial fellow. Our hunger appeased, 
we threw aside our green dinner plates, and the cooking 
utensils were washed and packed up again. An hour we 
devoted to a most welcome siesta, but as soon as our 
guards shouted their " ready," all were again in motion, 
the baggage was strapped up, and we took up our line 
of march. 

We were much more careful in our selection of a resting 
place for the night, and carefully avoided the neighbour- 
hood of any water, as we knew that all savage animals, 
before commencing their nightly search for prey, betake 
themselves to such places, either to quench their thirst or 
to bathe. For the sake of quiet sleep we were obliged, as 
well as we could, to avoid the proximity of these dwellers 
of the forest, and chose a spot free from underbrush, and 
commanding a wide view of the surrounding country. 
Then our people were obliged to procure a large supply 
of wood, as well for the great fire around which we were 
to encamp, as for the smaller ones in the circle, which 
were a great protection to us. One of us, with a pair of 
cocked pistols, or the baker with his huge sabre, accom- 
panied them as a guard. Our evening meal was prepared 
and partaken of with far less noise and bustle than our 



dinners had been, either in consequence of our increased 
fatigue, or of a kind of timid anxiety, a discomfort of 
mind, if I may call it so, always induced by darkness and 
loneliness. Each edged himself closer to his neighbor, 
and was vovy careful to go no farther from the fire than 
was necessary' ; even oiu- eyes avoided any long or sharp 
Investigation of the surrounding darkness, for however 
charming these forests may appear illuminated by the 
clear light of day, they .are unspeakably fearful to the 
traveller when veiled under the thick mantle of night. 
No longer, as in the morning, do a thousand flute-like 
songs awake the slumbering echoes, but a death-like still- 
ness broods over a wasted desert, broken only by the 
fidghtful tuwhoo of the night owl, the short bark of the 
jackal, the growl of a tiger, or the trumpeting of an 
elephant, breaking through the thicket, and then suddenly 
every thing relapses into the former stillness, as of the 
grave. 

III. 

One evening the whole party, after a long day's march, 
quite wearied out, arrived at our place of encampment, and 
as the servants were especially fatigued with carrying our 
heavy baggage, d'Allemand and I undertook the first 
watch and from time to time replenished the fire that 
was burning in our midst. About midnight we perceived 
a shaking and quaking of the earth as if a squadron of 
cavalry were dashing upon us. We immediately aroused 
our whole company except the baker, whom we allowed to 
snore on quietly, as he had as usual taken too much drink, 



 

and might perhaps, in such a confused state of mind, have 
committed some folly which would have ruined us all. 

Scarcely had friend Templyn, upon whose cool courage 
I placed the greatest reliance, rubbed the sleep from hia 
eyes, when we heard just behind us, from the crashing 
thicket, a clear piercing cry, and turning our frightened 
gaze in that direction, we saw the monster from whose 
throat it had proceeded, illuminated by the light of our 
fire — a huge elephant, who was glaring directly at us, and 
who whirled his trunk aloft in such a threatening manner, 
and so quickly, that we seemed to hear the whirring of a 
great spinning-wheel. We were just about to greet our 
unwelcome guest with a few bullets, when one of the 
servants, who had all hastily climbed the nearest treej 
besought us to desist, as the terrible creature would, if 
our balls did not happen to strike it just in the spot where 
a wound would be mortal, trample us all under his feet 
in his mad fury. If we took this advice we were entirely 
without means of defence, for unfortunately our torches 
and rockets lay so near the dreadful creature that any one 
attempting to seize them would meet with certain death. 
In this extremity we thought of our gongs, and instantly 
sounded them, with, as it proved, the very best success, 
for no sooner did the sound reach his ear than the monstei 
uttered a yell so loud and so terrible that the boldest heart 
quaked for fear. At the same time, in his fierce rage, he 
tore up with his trunk a young tree that stood near him 
by the roots, bent it up together, and crushed it under his 
feet like a cabbage-stalk. After thus moderately giving 
vent to his anger, he turned towards us again and appeared 



 

to be meditating a like destruction of our baggage. Invol- 
untarily we pressed forward to the rescue of our treasures, 
and uttered a loud piercing shout which was echoed back 
by our people in the tree, who now gave us up for lost. 
And as our gongs were all the while going like mad, our 
disagreeable guest found it so intolerable that, shaking his 
ears in a waggish manner to express his disapprobation of 
orur concert, he at last fairly turned round and made off. 
His retreat soon changed into such a hasty flight that in a 
few minutes he was out of the reach of the balls that we 
sent after him. 

So ended, happily enough, an adventure which had well- 
nigh put an end to our expedition ; at which we were all 
abundantly rejoiced, not merely because we had escaped 
with only a good fright, but also because in this first real 
danger we had discovered and learnt well how far we 
might depend upon our servants in such a time of need ; 
we immediately divided among them our torches and 
rockets that we might have something at hand to serve 
for weapons, for we had often heard, and can now testify, 
that nothing frightens even the most savage animals, so 
certainly as fire. 

Afl I had always been accustomed in any urgent situa- 
tion to rely upon myself I kept myself always prepared to 
meet the enemy at any moment, and earnestly warned our 
servants every evening to be upon their guard, and never 
during their watch allow themselves to be overcome by 
deep. But words are always easier than deeds, and on the 
following night I was unconsciously nodding when the two 
ervants wlio were watching with me, roused me with the 

 



 

cry of " master, a tiger !" Wide awake in a moment, I 
looked around, and they pointed me to two spar kling little 
balls that gleamed upon us from the thicket not far from 
our outermost watch-fire. There was no doubt that they 
were the eyes of a tiger who only awaited a favourable 
opportunity to seize and carry off some one of us. Father 
Templyn, our ever ready protector, was awakened, and we 
agreed to aim at the same time for the spot just between 
the two points of light. We shot and immediately heard 
a struggling and writhing as of some creature in the death 
struggle, which grew less and less distinct, and then 
oea,sed. In the meantime the noise of our rifles had roused 
the rest of our party, and as I really could keep awake 
no longer, the baker undertook to watch in my stead for 
the rest of the night. But at break of day we were again 
aroused by a joyful shout from him. He informed us that 
we had been fortunate enough to kill a Royal tiger of the 
largest size, and our servants were already engaged in skin- 
ning him. We found that both balls had taken effect, and 
had shattered his skull ; as then we had each an equal 
claim to the beautifully spotted hide, we drew lots for it, 
and fortune favored me. As soon as our people had 
finished their task of skinning the tiger, we again started 
on our way. 

We were now quite near to the mountains which cross 
the island, and as the path in the plain swarmed so with 
ants that we every moment simk deep into their nests 
and progress was most difiicult, we determined to ascend 
the mountains for a little distance in hopes of finding a 
better path and satisfying our curiosity as to the surround- 



 

ing country. This plan d'Allemand did not relish at all 
and he did his best to dissuade us from adopting it ; yet, 
had it not been for a sad accident which we shortly 
met with, and which frustrated our purpose, he would 
hardly have succeeded in altering our fixed determi- 
nation. 

We had already turned our steps in the direction deci- 
ded upon, when in passing by a thinly-clothed tree we 
observed a mass of honey — a bee hive so immense that it 
awakened in us a strong desire to possess it; but the 
bough from which it hung was so high as to preclude the 
possibility of smoking out the bees according to the usual 
custom. We were just turning from it when one of our 
servants offered to climl) the tree and chop off the bough 
with an axe, so that we could easily overcome our little 
enemies. We accepted his offer and promised him a 
double share of the sweet booty for his daring. The poor 
fellow climbed the tree and reached the heavily-laden 
bough in safety ; it already quivered with the first stroke 
of his axe, but he was prevented from giving another by 
the bees, who rushed raging in thick swarms fi"om their 
cells, and so cruelly attacked his naked body that he 
uttered a loud cry, and closing his eyes, turned to come 
down ; unfortunately, in his descent he made a mis-step, 
fell and broke his leg. This misfortune drew a cross 
through our reckoning — a continuation of our former plan 
was not to be thought of, as we could not possibly leave 
the sufferer to the mercy of fate, or rather to certain des- 
truction. Nothing was left for us but to place him upon a 
litter of boughs, hastily woven together, and seek the 



 

nearest inhabited place, which our guide assured as we 
eouid reach the same day. 

If this untimely event made us sullen and silent, the 
Frenchman provoked us still more by his ill-timed and 
extravagant merriment. He made no attempt to conceal 
his delight at the stupidity of the man, which had brought 
us to our senses, and destroyed our nonsensical plan. He 
blessed the bees, and vowed he would write a song in praise 
of their brave defence of their property. We could not 
listen to him without vexation, but we did not think it 
worth while to point out to him his want of courtesy and 
good feeling. Fate, however, revenged us upon him. In 
the joy of his heart he attempted to spring over the trunk 
of an old decayed tree that was lying directly in his path ; 
with one leap he was on the other side, but sank up to 
his shoulders in the soft mud, which only a thin treach- 
erous bark, as it were, covered. His sudden disappearance 
caused a loud shout of joy, which continued until, not 
without trouble, we had drawn him from his prison. As 
soon as he had brushed from his clothes all marks of the 
accident, we begged him for a song in praise of decayed 
trees, which he refused with great politeness and vivacity. 
He was really fortunate to have escaped so well, for these 
old trees often are hiding places for a peculiar tind of 
venomous snake, or for poisonous spiders of an enormous 
size. 

  Late in the evening we reached Vedative, quite a large 
village, situated in the midst of a wide open plain, where 
we saw human faces for the first time since our departure 
from Panoryn. 



 

Our first care was to entrust our patient to the best of 
the many potters inhabiting the surrounding countiy, who 
often combine with their trade quite a degree of skill in 
setting broken bones. 

IV. 

We now followed the low monotonous sea beach for 
several days, until we arrived at the river Calnar, where 
we again, to escape the heat of the sun, and the increasing 
tedium of the journey, steered our course inland. The 
river, that we chose for our night encampment, was quite 
dry, and only here and there were to be seen hollows in its 
bed, filled with water and surrounded by thick bushes. 
Father Templyn, the insatiate hunter, proposed to me to 
conceal ourselves for one night in the vicinity of one of 
these basins of water, that we might have a glimpse of the 
monsters who came hither to quench their thirst. I had 
email desire to do so, as the low brush afibrded no protec- 
tion against the savage creatures, and there was great 
danger of treading upon snakes and other poisonous rep- 
tiles. 

But I allowed myself to be persuaded, and concealed 
myself in a bush, while Templyn and the Frenchman 
took up an advantageous position in another, at a little 
distance. 

We waited long in vain, and were thinking with regret 
of our camp, when the roaring of some wild animal was 
heard, and we presently saw three bufialoes approach the 
stream. They satisfied their thirst, and then waded fay 
into the water and laid themselves down, so that only 



 

fcheir snouts were visible above the surface. They had 
remained thus, in this comfortable position, quite still and 
tmmovable for about fifteen minutes, when a fourth buf- 
falo appeared, and, after he had snuffed the air for a few 
moments, began to drink. The others, indeed, raised their 
heads above the water at his approack, but did not seem 
inclined to hinder him from drinking. No sooner, how- 
ever, did he prepare to lie down in the water, than one of 
the three others raised himself up, and with the most 
fearful snortings rushed upon him. The heavens were 
perfectly free from clouds, and the moon revealed dis- 
tinctly every thing around, so that, in the excitement of 
this sight, I did not regret the loss of my sleep in the 
camp. It is perfectly impossible to describe the power 
and fierceness with which these enraged creatures attacked 
one another. Before each onslaught they retired a little 
epace, pawed the sand, threw it high in the air, and then 
with a snort that actually seemed to be accompanied by 
sparks of fire, like an arrow from a bow, they rushed upon 
one another, each time with so much force as to drive 
their opponent staggering back again. Sometimes they 
would stand apart for a breathing space, like statues, until, 
their heads bent down to the ground, they renewed the 
fight. Each time, however, that they retired they lessened 
the distance between them — blow followed blow with a 
dull crashing sound that echoed far and near, up and 
down the thickly wooded banks of the river. Fortune 
decided in favor of the defender of the bath, who gave the 
disturber of his rest such a decisive butt in the side that 
the latter, deeming it imprudent to await a second, left the 



 

field of battle, and hastened towards the forest. Hif 
valiant conqueror did not think it worth while to follow 
him, but contented himself with a deafening roar of triumph, and returned to his companions in the water. 

Spite of my enjoyment of this fearful duello, I had not- 
beheld it without a secret shudder; judge then of my 
terror when a ball, whistling past me, immediately aroused 
all three buffaloes. They immediately arose with a loud 
roar, and two of them rushed towards the place M'hence 
the flash of the musket had proceeded, while the third 
directed his furious course directly towards the bush in 
which I lay concealed. In a terror which no words can 
describe, I betook myself to flight, but flight deprived me 
of my usual presence of mind. I had only proceeded a 
few steps when I lost my hat, and my long hair became 
inextricably entangled in the thorny bushes around me. 
I heard the bellowing of the dreadful beast not very far 
firom me, and in despair I made one final effort to extricate 
myself, which almost prostrated me upon the ground, and 
left nearly one half of my curls behind me. I had now 
some hope of reaching our camp, which was about a hundred steps distant, but I felt, as one often does in a dream, 
that my legs were paralyzed by fear, and an insible 
power seemed to detain me immovably on the spot. My 
destroyer was now so near that I could feel his hot breath, 
but sufficient strength remained for me, fortunately, to 
throw myself directly in his path, and the fearful creature 
plunged, in his headlong career, directly over and past me. 
I had given myself up for lost, and well I might do so, for 
the hind hoof of the buffalo left its impression in the 

earth only a hand's breadth from my head, and I was 
covered with the sand which it had tossed up over me. 

I now, recovered sufficient presence of mind to creep upon 
my hands and knees into the nearest thicket, and there, 
chattering and trembling with fear, conceal myself. How 
long I remained there I do not know; my full conscious- 
ness returned for the first time when I heard the voices of 
my compa,nions and of our servants, who had come, armed 
with torches, to seek for me. I cried out to them and 
they released me with some difficulty from my hiding 
place, wondering how I had contrived to force myself so 
far into the thorny thicket. All this mischief had been 
caused by Templyn's eager desire for the chase at all 
hazards, and spite of his excusing himself by the assurance 
that his piece went off by accident, and of my warm friend- 
ship for him, I could not forbear expressing my displeasure 
at his folly which had so nearly cost me my life, especially 
as I had accompanied him this night only upon the express 
condition that no large animals should be attacked. 

In consequence of this adventure I suffered the next day 
from headache and fever, and could not continue the jour- 
ney; accordingly we remained during the following. night 
at our dangerous encampment by the side of the river, but 
were all upon our guard. From time to time we heard 
a strange rustling which inreased towards morning. A 
splashing in the pools and a suppressed grunting led us to 
believe that wild boars were wallowing in the swampy bed 
of the river. In spite of the darkness which followed the 
moon's setting and which prevented us from distinguishing 
anything beyond our watch-fires, we directed our rifles 



 

towards the spot whence the sound proceeded end fired. 
It immediately seemed to us that the creature left the 
water and hurried to the thicket. After all was quiet 
again we heard a breathing and grunting as of some 
creature that might have been wounded by us ; we awaited 
with impatience the break of day, and with the first dawn 
instituted a search. As the animal had long been quiet, 
our search was for some time fruitless, and we had already 
determined to lose no more time about it, when Templyn's 
servant discovered behind a large bush a wild boar stretched 
out without any signs of life, and we immediately declared 
him to be our property. I, with the baker, was nearest at 
hand when the discovery was made, and my companion 
instantly prepared to cut off the tail to present to the 
Frenchman, whom none could endure since his unfeeling 
conduct. He seized hold of the tail, laughing, and was 
just about to apply the knife, when the creature, which 
had lain, to all appearance dead, rose upon his fore feet 
with a horrible grunt. The expression on the face of the 
amateur surgeon at this moment was a rich study. Pale 
as death, he stood with open mouth, immovable, and 
gasped for breath. I, myself, was startled, and seized my 
rifle. But as we both soon perceived that the animal tried 
in vain to rise, and then sank back again, I was relieved, 
while the baker grew so angry that, full of rage, he at last 
buried his huge sabre in the creature and quieted it forever. 
His ridiculous wrath furnished material for many a joke 
against him for sometime afterwards. 

After many other insignificant adventures, we at last am- 
ved happily at the end of our journey, where we met many 



 

friends and acquaintances whose kindness made our stay 
among them, a continued festival. 

Every day they drove us about in the country near the 
city, and every evening we were invited either to a wed- 
ding, ball, or assembly. I was in excellent spirits, for I 
had attained the object of my journey, the satisfaction of 
my curiosity, but friend Templyn was quite cast down, for 
he found that his hopes had deceived him, and the profitable oflSce that he had come to seek, had been given away 
before our arrival. It fared still worse with the French- 
man, fo)c instead of receiving a cordial reception from the 
government, which he had supposed that the important 
papers that he carried with him would ensure him, he was 
arrested and imprisoned as an English spy. To the baker 
fell the best lot of all, for he married the rich widow at 
whose house he lodged, and gave himself up to domestic 
life. 

During my stay in Colombo I became acquainted with a 
Portuguese who had travelled much as a merchant, soldier, 
pilgrim, and what-not, and who fascinated me by his 
agreeable and instructive conversation. He informed me 
one day that he was determined to undertake a journey to 
the mountains in the middle of the island, as soon as he 
could find a companion upon whom he could rely, and who 
could bear the hardships of such an excursion. He thought 
me " the very man whom he had been looking for," and 
told me, after I had promised the strictest secrecy, that 
during his last excursion in the above-mentioned mountains, he had lost his way, and had discovered in a deep 
valley, a stream almost dry, whose banks were covered 




with rubies and other precious stones, but that he had not 
dared to take any away with him for fear of the natives, 
who are commanded by their chiefs, to search every trav- 
eller, and to murder without hesitation, all in whose pos- 
session precious stones are found. He had, however, 
marked the spot and it would be very easy to find it again, 
if I would accompany him. 

The undertaking appeared to me by no means as easy 
as he represented it, as we should be obliged to avoid all 
frequented paths and penetrate through pathless wilds and 
forests ; I reminded him of this and also of the danger of 
meeting with the aforesaid unpitying savages. 

But he knew well how to answer all my objections and 
I at last consented to accompany him upon the condition 
that father Templyn should be informed of the expedition 
and invited to join it, for I imagined that in his straitened 
circumstances, he would grasp eagerly this opportunity of 
enriching Jiimself. But the old man shook his head, and 
laughing scornfully at my proposition, advised me kindly 
not to be led astray by the fancies of the brain-struck Portuguese, who had certainly mistaken pebbles for precious 
stones. He brought forward other and better arguments 
against the expedition, and as the Portuguese was passing 
by our room at the time, he called him in, reproached him 
bitterly with putting such ideas into my head, and threatened if he did not leave me in peace, to find some way of 
forcing him to do so. The wily Portuguese concealed his 
displeasure, and soothed Templyn with the assurance that 
he had himself, after more mature consideration, given up 
the expedition and was determined to visit the Indian 



 

continent. He added that it would be a great pleaisure to 
him if we would receive him into our company on our way 
home, as far as Fort Chilaw, where he had business to 
transact. His request was so modest that without any 
hesitation we granted it. 



Early the next morning we bade farewell to Colombo, 
and soon afterwards reached the village of NegombO; 
where storm and rain obliged us to seek shelter, and 
where I determined to remain for some days and await 
better weather. Templyn now, in consequence of his 
disappointed expectations, in perpetual ill-humor, insisted 
so obstinately the next morning upon departure, that we 
separated, and I sent him on his way with the servants 
and baggage-carriers. Before he went, however, he drew 
me aside, and with a kind of frank honesty which never 
deserted him, warned me for God's sake not to give any 
heed to the Portuguese who remained with me, and not to 
allow myself to be dragged to ruin and death by the 
phantoms of his brain. One more pressure of the hand, 
and he was gone. 

In fact the Portuguese, who bore the name of Manuel 
de Cruz, had not ceased, since our departure from Colombo, 
to endeavour to excite my imagination until he became 
convinced that his wondrous golden mountain had no 
longer an effect upon me. But now he believed that the 
departure of my friend opened a new field for him, of 
which he did not fail to take advantage, and followed up 



 

his wondrous assertions with the entreaty that I would 
yield to his wishes and follow him. 

" And whither ?" I interrupted him, with a quiet smile ; 
"over mountain and valley, through thicket and thorns, 
to fill my pockets with pebbles and dream of diamonds. 
My way hes in the direction of my home, where dear 
ones are awaiting my return with longing." 

Manuel returned my quiet smile, and begged me to 
listen to him seriously and attentively. The moment had 
arrived when all reserve must be laid aside, and when he 
should have revealed to me the true state of the case, he 
had not the slightest doubt of what my determination 
would be. After he had reminded me of the well known 
fact, or rather report, that in the war with the Portuguese, 
the native kings had packed their enormous wealth in 
great iron chests, and had thrown these into some river, 
he continued that he had learnt from his father that the 
Portuguese had obtained possession of one of these chests, 
but being obliged to effect a hasty retreat, they had not 
been able to take it with them, but had concealed it in 
the mountains. He had, indeed, told me of the discovery 
of the wonderful mountain, but that was not so ; neither 
had he lost his way in the mountains, but had gone 
thither with the express purpose of finding the hidden 
treasure. After a long search, and incredible pains, he 
nad at length succeeded in finding it in a little cave in the 
rocks, on the bank of a small stream, but he could discover 
neither opening, cover, or lock, and his eflforts to break it 
open with a stone were entirely unavailing; the spot, 
however, where the chest lay hid, he had so firmly im- 



 

pressed upon his memory that he could find his way 
thither in theark. It would only cost three or four 
days of fatigue and labor, such as is gone through with on 
every hunting expedition, and certainly that was not 
paying too dear for a future of pleasure and plenty. 

Why should I deny that these treacherous words 
sounded sweeter than ever in my ears. They had the 
more weight with me as I had often heard the sinking of 
the treasure spoken of as an indubitable fact. And yet 
the adventure that the Portuguese proposed, appeared so 
strange and romantic, that I was perfectly undecided what 
to do. Here the wildness of the undertaking, the hope of 
riches allured me, and there thoughts of my young wife 
beckoned me in quite another direction. After a long con- 
flict, my folly and the charm of such a strange expedition 
gained the mastery, and I promised the Portuguese who was 
still importuning me, to accompany him, if he would 
solemnly assure me upon his honor and conscience that 
every thing that he had told me was true and that he had 
falsified in nothing. 

With flashing eyes and the most solemn oaths he assured 
me that all he had said was literally true, and then all 
remains of indecision vanished from my mind. 

We now hastened to Chilow, quickly made the necessary 
preparations for our journey, and after a few days set out 
before sunrise without haAnng informed a soul of our piu:- 
pose. 

Our only baggage, besides our guns and swords, consisted 
of a bag containing about 20 pounds of rice, a kettle to 
cook it in, a bottle holding three quarts of brandy, a bear 



 

skin, a coil of etrong rope, some copper basins which were 
to answer as gongs, an axe, and lastly some files and forc- 
ing tools, with which to possess ourselves of the contents 
of the mysterious chest. 

At noon we arrived at a little stream that came so 
swollen from the mountains, that we were obliged to ford 
it. We undressed, and, in order to lure away the croco- 
diles, that had plumped into the water at our approach, 
my companion begged me to go some hundred steps up the 
stream and shout with all my might, while he could then 
take over the baggage in two loads. Our stratagem suc- 
ceeded, and now it was my turn to cross the stream which 
I prepared to do, relying far less, however, upon the shouts 
of the Portuguese than upon my good sword, which I held 
in my right hand, ready to plunge down the throat of any 
monster who should dare to come too near me. As I 
reached the middle of the stream I looked up at my com- 
panion whose face was turned towards me and who was 
shouting most fiiriously, when I saw, (judge of my hor- 
ror !) not many feet from him a tiger with crooked back
