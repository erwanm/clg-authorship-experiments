" You mean that the baker has signed the articles, 
and is a member of the Community?" 

" Yes ; but the baker is old, very old ; thirty year ! 
Gustav not twenty and three yet ; he come home, then 
he sign." 

"And have you signed these articles, Wilhel- 
mina ? " 

"Yes; all the womens signs." 

" What does the paper say ? " 

"Da ich Unterzeichneter," began the girl. 

" I cannot understand that. Tell me in English." 

"Well; you wants to join the Zoar Community of 
Separatists ; you writes your name and says, ' Give me 
house, victual, and clothes for my work and I join ; 
and I never fernerer Forderung an besagte Gesellschaft 
machen kann, oder will.' " 

" Will never make further demand upon said soci- 
ety," I repeated, translating slowly. 

" Yes ; that is it." 

" But who takes charge of all the money ? " 

"The trustees." 

" Don't they give you any ? " 

"No; for what? It 's no good," answered Wil- 
helmina. 

I knew that all the necessaries of life were dealt 



 

out to the members of the Community according to 
their need, and, as they never went outside of their 
valley, they could scarcely have spent money even if 
they had possessed it. But, nevertheless, it was start- 
ling in this nineteenth century to come upon a sincere 
belief in the worthlessness of the green-tinted paper 
we cherish so fondly. " Gustav will have learned its 
value," I thought, as Mina, having finished the straw- 
berry-bed, started away towards the dairy to assist 
in the butter-making. 

I strolled on up the little hill, past the picturesque 
bakery, where through the open window I caught a 
glimpse of the " old, very old Jacob," a serious young 
man of thirty, drawing out his large loaves of bread 
from the brick oven with a long-handled rake. It was 
gingerbread-day also, and a spicy odor met me at the 
window ; so I put in my head and asked for a piece, 
receiving a card about a foot square, laid on fresh 
grape-leaves. 

" But I cannot eat all this," I said, breaking off a 
corner. 

"O, dat 's noding!" answered Jacob, beginning to 
knead fresh dough in a long white trough, the village 
supply for the next day. 

" I have been sitting with Wilhelmina," I remarked, 
as I leaned on the casement, impelled by a desire to 
see the effect of the name. 

" So ? " said Jacob, interrogatively. 



 

"Yes; she is a sweet girl." 

"So?" (doubtfully.) 

"Don't you think so, Jacob?" 

" Ye-es. So-so. A leetle black," answered this im- 
passive lover. 

" But you wish to marry her ? " 

"O, ye-es. She young and strong; her fader say 
she good to work. I have children five ; I must have 
some one in the house." 

" Jacob ! Is that the way to talk ? " I exclaimed. 

" Warum nicht ? " replied the baker, pausing in his 
kneading, and regarding me with wide-open, candid 
eyes. 

"Why not, indeed?" I thought, as I turned away 
from the window. " He is at least honest, and no 
doubt in his way he would be a kind husband to little 
Mina. But what a way!" 

I walked on up the street, passing the pleasant 
house where all the infirm old women of the Com- 
munity were lodged together, carefully tended by ap- 
pointed nurses. The aged sisters were out on the 
piazza sunning themselves, like so many old cats. 
They were bent with hard, out-door labor, for they 
belonged to the early days when the wild forest cov- 
ered the fields now so rich, and only a few log-cabins 
stood on the site of the tidy cottages and gardens of 
the present village. Some of them had taken the long 
journey on foot from Philadelphia westward, four hun- 



 

dred and fifty miles, in the depths of winter. "Well 
might they rest from their labors and sit in the sun- 
shine, poor old souls ! 

A few days later, my friendly newspaper mentioned 
the arrival of the German regiment at Camp Chase. 
" They will probably be paid off in a day or two," I 
thought, "and another day may bring them here." 
Eager to be the first to tell the good news to my little 
favorite, I hastened up to the garden, and found her 
engaged, as usual, in weeding. 

" Mina," I said, " I have something to tell you. The 
regiment is at Camp Chase ; you will see Gustav soon, 
perhaps this week." 

And there, before my eyes, the transformation I had 
often fancied took place ; the color rushed to the brown 
surface, the cheeks and lips glowed in vivid red, and the 
heavy eyes opened wide and shone like stars, with a 
brilliancy that astonished and even disturbed me. The 
statue had a soul at last; the beauty dormant had 
awakened. But for the fire of that soul would this 
expected Pygmalion suffice ? Would the real prince 
fill his place in the long^cherished dreams of this 
beauty of the wood ? 

The girl had risen as I spoke, and now she stood 
erect, trembling with excitement, her hands clasped on 
her breast, breathing quickly and heavily as though ah 
overweight of joy was pressing down her heart; her 
eyes were fixed upon my face, but she saw me not. 



 

Strange was her gaze, like the gaze of one walking in 
sleep. Her sloping shoulders seemed to expand and 
chafe against the stuff gown as though they would 
burst their bonds ; the blood glowed in her face and 
throat, and her lips quivered, not as though tears were 
coming, but from the fulness of unuttered speech. 
Her emotion resembled the intensest fire of fever, and 
yet it seemed natural ; like noon in the tropics when 
the gorgeous flowers flame in the white, shadowless 
heat. Thus stood Wilhelmina, looking up into the sky 
with eyes that challenged the sun. 

" Come here, child," I said ; " come here and sit by 
me. We will talk about it." 

But she neither saw nor heard .me. I drew her 
down on the bench at my side; she yielded uncon- 
sciously; her slender form throbbed, and pulses were 
beating under my hands wherever I touched her. 
"Mina !" I said again. But she did not answer. Like 
an unfolding rose, she revealed her hidden, beautiful 
heart, as though a spirit had breathed upon the bud ; 
silenced in the presence of this great love, I ceased 
speaking, and left her to herself. After a time single 
words fell from her lips, broken utterances of happi- 
ness. I was as nothing ; she was absorbed in the One. 
" Gustav ! mein Gustav ! " It was like the bird's note, 
oft repeated, ever the same. So isolated, so intense 
was her joy, that, as often happens, my rnind took ref- 
uge in the opposite extreme of commonplace, and I 



 

found myself wondering whether she would be able 
to eat boiled beef and cabbage for dinner, or fill the 
soft-soap barrel for the laundry- women, later in the day. 

All the morning I sat .under the trees with Wil- 
helmina, who had forgotten her life-long tasks as 
Completely as though they had never existed. I hated 
to leave her to the leather-colored wife of the old 
gardener, and lingered until the sharp voice came 
out from the distant house-door, calling, "Veel-hel- 
meeny" as the twelve-o'clock bell summoned the 
Community to dinner. But as Mina rose and swept 
back the heavy braids that had fallen from the little 
ivory stick which confined them, I saw that she was 
armed cap-a-pie in that full happiness from which 
all weapons glance off harmless. 

All the rest of the day she was like a thing pos- 
sessed. I followed her to the hill-pasture, whither 
she had gone to mind the cows, and found her coiled 
up on the grass in the blaze of the afternoon sun, 
like a little salamander. She was lost in day-dreams, 
and the decorous cows had a holiday for once in 
their sober lives, wandering beyond bounds at will, 
and even tasting the dissipations of the marsh, stand- 
ing unheeded in the bog up to their sleek knees. 
Wilhelmina had not many words to give me; her 
English vocabulary was limited; she had never read 
a line of romance nor a verse of poetry. The nearest 
approach to either was the Community hymn-book, 



 

containing the Separatist hymns, of which the follow- 
ing lines are a specimen, 

" Ruhe ist das beste Gut 
Dasz man haben kann," 

"Rest is the best good 
That man can have," 

and which embody the religious doctrine of the Zoar 
Brethren, although they think, apparently, that the 
labor of twelve hours each day is necessary to its 
enjoyment. The "Kuhe," however, refers more es- 
pecially to their quiet seclusion away from the tur- 
moil of the wicked world outside. 

The second morning after this it was evident that 
an unusual excitement was abroad in the phlegmatic 
village. All the daily duties were fulfilled as usual 
at the Wirthshaus : Pauline went up to the bakery 
with her board, and returned with her load of bread 
and bretzels balanced on her head; Jacobina served 
our coffee with her slow precision; and the broad- 
shouldered, young-faced Lydia patted and puffed up 
our mountain-high feather-beds with due care. The 
men went afield at the blast of the horn, the work- 
shops were full and the mills running. But, never- 
theless, all was not the same; the air seemed full 
of mystery; there were whisperings when two met, 
furtive signals, and an inward excitement glowing 
in the faces of men, women, and children, hitherto 



 

placid as their own sheep. "They have heard the 
news," I said, after watching the tailor's Gretchen 
and the blacksmith's Barbara stop to exchange a 
whisper behind the wood-house. Later in the day 
we learned that several letters from the absent sol- 
dier-boys had been received that morning, announcing 
their arrival on the evening train. The news had 
flown from one end of the village to the other; and 
although the well-drilled hands were all at work, 
hearts were stirring with the greatest excitement of 
a lifetime, since there was hardly a house where 
there was not one expected. Each large house often 
held a number of families, stowed away in little sets 
of chambers, with one dining-room in common. 

Several times during the day we- saw the three 
trustees conferring apart with anxious faces. The war 
had been a sore trouble to them, owing to their con- 
scientious scruples against rendering military service. 
They had hoped to remain non-combatants. But the 
country was on fire with patriotism, and nothing less 
than a Tiona fide Separatist in United States uniform 
would quiet the surrounding towns, long jealous of 
the wealth of this foreign community, misunderstand- 
ing its tenets, and glowing with that zeal against "sym- 
pathizers" which kept star-spangled banners flying 
over every suspected house. "Hang out the flag!" was 
their cry, and they demanded that Zoar should hang 
out its soldiers, giving them to understand that if not 



 

voluntarily hung out, they would soon be involuntarily 
hung up ! A draft was ordered, and then the young 
men of the society, who had long chafed against their 
bonds, broke loose, volunteered, and marched away, 
principles or no principles, trustees or no trustees. 
These bold hearts once gone, the village sank into qui- 
etude again. Their letters, however, were a source of 
anxiety, coming as they did from the vain outside 
world; and the old postmaster, autocrat though he 
was, hardly dared to suppress them. But he said, 
shaking his head, that they " had fallen upon troublous 
times," and handed each dangerous envelope out with 
a groan. But the soldiers were not skilled penmen ; 
their letters, few and far between, at length stopped 
entirely. Time passed, and the very existence of the 
runaways had become a far-off problem to the wise 
men of the Community, absorbed in their slow calcula- 
tions and cautious agriculture, when now,, suddenly, it 
forced itself upon them face to face, and they were 
required to solve it in the twinkling of an eye. The 
bold hearts were coming back, full of knowledge of the 
outside world; almost every house would hold one, 
and the bands of law and order would be broken. 
Before this prospect the trustees quailed. Twenty 
years before they would have forbidden the entrance 
of these unruly sons within their borders; but now 
they dared not, since even into Zoar had penetrated 
the knowledge that America was a free country. The 



younger generation were not as their fathers were; 
objections had been openly made to the cut of the 
Sunday coats, and the girls had spoken together of 
ribbons ! 

The shadows of twilight seemed very long in fall- 
ing that night, but at kst there was no further ex- 
cuse for delaying the evening bell, and home came 
the laborers to their evening meal. There was no 
moon, a soft mist obscured the stars, and the night 
was darkened with the excess of richness which rose 
from the ripening valley-fields and fat bottom-lands 
along the river. The Community store opposite the 
"Wirthshaus was closed early in the evening, the 
houses of the trustees were dark, and indeed the vil- 
lage was almost unlighted, as if to hide its own ex- 
citement. The entire population was abroad in the 
night, and one by one the men and boys stole away 
down the station road, a lovely, winding track on 
the hillside, following the river on its way down 
the valley to the little station on the grass-grown 
railroad, a branch from the main track As ten 
o'clock came, the women and girls, grown bold with 
excitement, gathered in the open space in front of 
the Wirthshaus, where the lights from the windows 
illumined their faces. There I saw the broad-shoul- 
dered Lydia, Eosine, Doroty, and all the rest, in their 
Sunday clothes, flushed, laughing, and chattering ; 
but no Wilhelmina. 



 

" Where can she be ? " I said. 

If she was there, the larger girls concealed her 
with their buxom breadth ; I looked for the slender 
little maiden in vain. 

" Shu ! " cried the girls, " de bugle ! " 

Far down the station road we heard the bugle and 
saw the glimmering of lights among the trees. On 
it came, a will-o'-the-wisp procession : first a detach- 
ment of village boys each with a lantern or torch, 
next the returned soldiers winding their bugles, for, 
German-like, they all had musical instruments, then 
an excited crowd of brothers and cousins loaded 
with knapsacks, guns, and military accoutrements of 
all kinds ; each man had something, were it only a 
tin cup, and proudly they marched in the footsteps 
of their glorious relatives, bearing the spoils of war. 
The girls set up a shrill cry of welcome as the pro- 
cession approached, but the ranks continued unbroken 
until the open space in front of the Wirthshaus was 
reached ; then, at a signal, the soldiers gave three 
cheers, the villagers joining in with all their hearts 
and lungs, but wildly and out of time, like the scat- 
tering fire of an awkward squad. The sound had 
never been heard in Zoar before. The soldiers gave 
a final "Tiger-r-r!" and then broke ranks, mingling 
with the excited crowd, exchanging greetings and 
embraces. All talked at once ; some wept, some 
laughed ; and through it all silently stood the three 



 

trustees on the dark porch in front of the store, 
looking down upon their wild flock, their sober faces 
visible in the glare of the torches and lanterns be- 
low. The entire population was present ; even the 
babies were held up on the outskirts of the crowd, 
stolid and staring. 

" Where can Wilhelmina be ? " I said again. 

" Here, under the window ; I saw her long ago," 
replied one of the women. 

Leaning against a piazza-pillar, close under my 
eyes, stood the little maiden, pale and still. I could 
not disguise from myself that she looked almost ugly 
among those florid, laughing girls, for her color was 
gone, and her eyes so fixed that they looked unnat- 
urally large; her somewhat heavy Egyptian features 
stood out in the bright light, but her small form 
was lost among the group of broad, white-kerchiefed 
shoulders, adorned with breast-knots of gay flowers. 
And had Wilhelmina no flower? She, so fond of 
blossoms ? I looked again ; yes, a little white rose, 
drooping and pale as herself. 

But where was Gustav ? The soldiers came and 
went in the crowd, and all spoke to Mina ; but 
where was the One ? I caught the landlord's little 
son as he passed, and asked the question. 

" Gustav ? Dat 'a him," he answered, pointing out 
a tall, rollicking soldier who seemed to be embracing 
the whole population in his gleeful welcome. That 



 

very soldier had passed Mina a dozen times, fling- 
ing a gay greeting to her each time ; but nothing 
more. 

After half an hour of general rejoicing, the crowd 
dispersed, each household bearing off in triumph the 
hero that fell to its lot. Then the tiled domiciles, 
where usually all were asleep an hour after twilight, 
blazed forth with unaccustomed light from eveiy little 
window ; and within we could see the circles, with 
flagons of beer and various dainties manufactured in 
secret during the day, sitting and talking together in 
a manner which, for Zoar, was a wild revel, since it 
was nearly eleven o'clock ! We were not the only 
outside spectators of this unwonted gayety; several 
times we met the three trustees stealing along in 
the shadow from house to house, like anxious spec- 
tres in broad-brimmed hats. No doubt they said to 
each other, " How, how will this end ! " 

The merry Gustav had gone off by Mina's side, 
which gave me some comfort ; but when in our 
rounds we came to the gardener's house and gazed 
through the open door, the little maiden sat apart, 
and the soldier, in the centre of an admiring circle, 
was telling stories of the war. 

I felt a foreboding of sorrow as I gazed out 
through the little window before climbing up into 
my high bed. Lights still twinkled in some of the 
houses, but a white mist was rising from the river, 



 

and the drowsy, long-drawn chant of the summer 
night invited me to dreamless sleep. 

The next morning I could not resist questioning 
Jacobina, who also had her lover among the soldiers, 
if all was well 

" yes. They stay, all but two. We 's mar- 
ried next mont." 

" And the two ? " 

"Karl and Gustav." 

"And Wilhelmina ! " I exclaimed. 

"O, she let him go," answered Jacobina, bringing 
fresh coffee. 

"Poor child! How does she bear it?" 

"O, so. Shfe cannot help. She say noding." 

" But the trustees, will they allow these young men 
to leave the Community ? " 

" They cannot help," said Jacobina. " Gustav and 
Karl write not in the book; they free to go. Wil- 
helmina marry Jacob ; it 's joost the same ; all 
r-r-ight," added Jacobina, who prided herself upon 
her English, caught from visitors at the Wirthshaus 
table. 

" Ah ! but it is not just the same," I thought as I 
went up to the garden to find my little maiden. She 
was not there ; the leathery mother said she was 
out on the hills with the cows. 

" So Gustav is going to leave the Community," I 
said in German. 



 

"Yes, better so. He is an idle, wild boy. Now, 
Veelhelmeeny can marry the baker, a good steady 
man." 

"But Mina does not like him," I suggested. 

" Das macht nichts," answered the leathery mother. 

Wilhelmina was not in the pasture ; I sought for 
her everywhere, and called her name. The poor child 
had hidden herself, and whether she heard me or not, 
she did not respond. All day she kept herself aloof; 
I almost feared she would never return ; but in the 
late twilight a little figure slipped through the gar- 
den-gate and took refuge in the house before I could 
speak; for I was watching for the child, apparently 
the only one, though a stranger, to care for her sor- 
row. 

"Can I not see her?" I said to the leathery 
mother, following to the door. 

" Eh, no ; she 's foolish ; she will not speak a 
word ; she has gone off to bed," was the answer. 

For three days I did not see Mina, so early did 
she flee away to the hills and so late return. I fol- 
lowed her to the pasture once or twice, but she 
would not show herself, and I could not discover 
her hiding-place. The fourth day I learned that 
Gustav and Karl were to leave the village in the 
afternoon, probably forever. The other soldiers had 
signed the articles presented by the anxious trustees, 
and settled down into the old routine, going afield 



 

with the rest, although still heroes of the hour ; they 
were all to be married in August. No doubt the 
hardships of their campaigns among the Tennessee 
mountains had taught them that the rich valley was 
a home not to be despised ; nevertheless, it was evi- 
dent that the flowers of the flock were those who 
were about departing, and tliat in Gustav and Karl 
the Community lost its brightest spirits. Evident to 
us ; but, possibly, the Community cared not for bright 
spirits. 

I had made several attempts to speak to Gustav; 
this morning I at last succeeded. I found him pol- 
ishing his bugle on the garden bench. 

"Why are you going away, Gustav?" I asked. 
"Zoar is a pleasant little village." 

"Too slow for me, miss." 

"The life is easy, however; you will find the 
world a hard place." 

"I don't mind work, ma'am, but I do like to be 
free. I feel all cramped up here, with these rules 
and bells; and, besides, I couldn't stand those trus- 
tees; they never let a fellow alone." 

" And Wilhelmina ? If you do go, I hope you 
will take her with you, or come for her when you 
have found work." 

" no, miss. All that was long ago. It 's all 
over now." 

" But you like her, Gustav ? " 




" O, so. She 's a good little thing, but too quiet 
for me." 

"But she likes you," I said desperately, for I saw 
no other way to loosen this Gordian knot. 

" no, miss. She got used to it, and has thought 
of it all these years ; that 's all. She 'll forget about 
it, and marry the baker." 

" But she does not like the baker." 

" Why not ? He 's a good fellow enough. She 'll 
like him in time. It 's all the same. I declare it 's 
too bad to see all these girls going on in the same 
old way, in their ugly gowns and big shoes ! Why, 
ma'am, I couldn't take Mina outside, even if I 
wanted to ; she 's too old to learn new ways, and 
everybody would laugh at her. She couldn't get 
along a day. Besides," said the young soldier, color- 
ing up to his eyes, "I don't mind telling you that 
that there 's some one else. Look here, ma'am." 
And he put into my hand a card photograph repre- 
senting a pretty girl, over-dressed, and adorned with 
curls and gilt jewelry. " That 's Miss Martin," said 
Gustav with pride ; " Miss Emmeline Martin, of Cin- 
cinnati. I 'm going to marry Miss Martin." 

As I held the pretty, flashy picture in my hand, all 
my castles fell to the ground. My plan for taking 
Mina home with me, accustoming her gradually to 
other clothes and ways, teaching her enough of the 
world to enable her to hold her place without pain, 


 

my hope that my husband might find a situation for 
Gustav in some of the iron-mills near Cleveland, in 
short, all the idyl I had woven, was destroyed. If it 
had not been for this red-cheeked Miss Martin in her 
gilt beads ! " Why is it that men will be such fools ? " 
I thought. Up sprung a memory of the curls and 
ponderous jet necklace I sported at a certain period 
of my existence, when John I was silenced, gave 
Gustav his picture, and walked away without a 
word. 

At noon the villagers, on their way back to work, 
paused at the Wirthshaus to say good by; Karl and 
Gustav were there, and the old woolly horse had 
already gone to the station with their boxes. Among 
the others came Christine, Karl's former affianced, heart- 
whole and smiling, already betrothed to a new lover ; 
but no "Wilhelmina. Good wishes and farewells were 
exchanged, and at last the two soldiers started away, 
falling into the marching step, and watched with fur- 
tive satisfaction by the three trustees, who stood to- 
gether in the shadow of the smithy, apparently deeply 
absorbed in a broken-down cask. 

It was a lovely afternoon, and I, too, strolled down 
the station road embowered in shade. The two sol- 
diers were not far in advance. I had passed the flour- 
mill on the outskirts of the village and was approach- 
ing the old quarry, when a sound startled me ; out 
from the rocks in front rushed a little figure, and cry- 



 

ing, " Gustav, mein Gustav ! " fell at the soldier's feet. 
It was Wilhelmina. 

I ran forward and took her from the young men; 
she lay in my arms as if dead. The poor child was 
sadly changed; always slender and swaying, she now 
looked thin and shrunken, her skin had a strange, dark 
pallor, and her lips were drawn in as if from pain. I 
could see her eyes through the large-orbed thin lids, 
and the brown shadows beneath extended down into 
the cheeks. 

" Was ist's ? " said Gustav, looking bewildered. " Is 
she sick ? " 

I answered "Yes," but nothing more. I could see 
that he had no suspicion of the truth, believing as he 
did that the " good fellow " of a baker would do very 
well for this " good little thing " who was " too quiet " 
for him. The memory of Miss Martin sealed my lips. 
But if it had not been for that pretty, flashy picture, 
would I not have spoken ! 

" You must go ; you will miss the train," I said, after 
a few minutes. " I will see to Mina." 

But Gustav lingered. Perhaps he was really troub- 
led to see the little sweetheart of his boyhood in such 
desolate plight; perhaps a touch of the old feeling 
came back; and perhaps, also, it was nothing of the 
kind, and, as usual, my romantic imagination was 
carrying me away. At any rate, whatever it was, he 
stooped over the fainting girl. 



 

" She looks bad," he said, " very bad. I wish But 
she 'll get well and marry the baker. Good by, Mina." 
And bending his tall form, he kissed her colorless 
cheek, and then hastened away to join the impatient 
Karl ; a curve in the road soon hid them from view. 

Wilhelmina had stirred at his touch ; after a moment 
her large eyes opened slowly; she looked around as 
if dazed, but all at once memory came back, and she 
started up with the same cry, " Gustav, mein Gustav ! " 
I drew her head down on my shoulder to stifle the 
sound; it was better the soldier should not hear it, 
and its anguish thrilled my own heart also. She had 
not the strength to resist me, and in a few minutes I 
knew that the young men were out of hearing as they 
strode on towards the station and out into the wide 
world. 

The forest was solitary, we were beyond the village ; 
all the afternoon I sat under the trees with the 
stricken girl. Again, as in her joy, her words were 
few; again, as in her joy, her whole being was in- 
volved. Her little rough hands were cold, a film had 
gathered over her eyes ; she did not weep, but moaned 
to herself, and all her senses seemed blunted. At 
nightfall I took her home, and the leathery mother 
received her with a frown ; but the child was beyond 
caring, and crept away, dumbly, to her room. 

The next morning she was off to the hills again, 
nor could I find her for several days. Evidently, in 



 

spite of my sympathy, I was no more to her than 
I should have been to a wounded fawn. She was 
a mixture of the wild, shy creature of the woods 
and the deep-loving woman of the tropics ; in either 
case I could be but small comfort. When at last I 
did see her, she was apathetic and dull ; her feelings, 
her senses, and her intelligence seemed to have gone 
within, as if preying upon her heart. She scarcely 
listened to my proposal to take her with me; for, in 
my pity, I had suggested it, in spite of its difficul- 
ties. 

" No," she said, mechanically, " I 's better here " ; 
and fell into silence again. 

A month later a friend went down to spend a 
few days in the valley, and upon her return described 
to us the weddings of the whilom soldiers. "It was 
really a pretty sight," she said, "the quaint peasant 
dresses and the flowers. Afterwards, the band went 
round the village playing their odd tunes, and all 
had a holiday. There were two civilians married 
also; I mean two young men who had not been to 
the war. It seems that two of the soldiers turned 
their backs upon the Community and their allotted 
brides, and marched away; but the Zoar maidens are 
not romantic, I fancy, for these two deserted ones 
were betrothed again and married, all in the short 
space of four weeks." 



 

" Was not one Wilhelmina, the gardener's daughter, 
a short, dark girl ? " I asked. 
" Yes." 

" And she married Jacob the baker ? " , ; 

"Yes." 

The next year, weary of the cold lake-winds, we left 
the icy shore and went down to the valley to meet the 
coming spring, finding her already there, decked with 
vines and flowers. A new waitress brought us our 
coffee. 

" How is Wilhelmina ? " I asked. 

"Eh, Wilhelmina? O, she not here now; she 
gone to the Next Country," answered the girl in a 
matter-of-fact way. " She die last October, and Jacob 
he haf anoder wife now." 

In the late afternoon I asked a little girl to show me 
Wilhelmina's grave in the quiet God's Acre on the hilL 
Innovation was creeping in, even here ; the later graves 
had mounds raised over them, and one had a little head- 
board with an inscription in ink. 

Wilhelmina lay apart, and some one, probably the 
old gardener, who had loved the little maiden in his 
silent way, had planted a rose-bush at the head of the 
mound. I dismissed my guide and sat there alone in 
the sunset, thinking of many things, but chiefly of this : 
"Why should this great wealth of love have been 
allowed to waste itself ? Why is it that the greatest 



 

power, unquestionably, of this mortal life should so 
often seem a useless gift ? " 

No answer came from the sunset clouds, and as twi- 
light sank down on the earth I rose to go. "I fully 
believe," I said, as though repeating a creed, " that this 
poor, loving heart, whose earthly body lies under this 
mound, is happy now in its own loving way. It has 
not been changed, but the happiness it longed for has 
come. How, we know not; but the God who made 
Wilhelmina understands her. He has given unto her 
not rest, not peace, but an active, living joy." 

I walked away through the wild meadow, under 
whose turf, unmarked by stone or mound, lay the first 
pioneers of the Community, and out into the forest road, 
untravelled save when the dead passed over it to their 
last earthly home. The evening was still and breath- 
less, and the shadows lay thick on the grass as I looked 
back. But I could still distinguish the little mo and 
with the rose-bush at its head, and, not without tears, 
I said, " Farewell, poor Wilhelmina ; farewell." 




IN September, 1855, 1 first saw the St. Clair Hats. 
Owing to Kaymond's determination, we stopped 
there. 

"Why go on?" he asked. "Why cross another 
long, rough lake, when here is all we want?" 

"But no one ever stops here," I said. 

" So much the better ; we shall have it all to our- 
selves." 

" But we must at least have a roof over our heads." 

"I presume we can find one." 

The captain of the steamer, however, knew of no 
roof save that covering a little lighthouse set on 
spiles, which the boat would pass within the half- 
hour; we decided to get off there, and throw our- 
selves upon the charity of the lighthouse-man. In 
the mean time, we sat on the bow with Captain 
Kidd, our four-legged companion, who had often 
accompanied us on hunting expeditions, but never 
before so far westward. It had been rough on 
Lake Erie, very rough. We, who had sailed the 




ocean with composure, found ourselves most inhu- 
manly tossed on the short, chopping waves of this 
fresh-water sea; we, who alone of all the cabin-list 
had eaten our four courses and dessert every day on 
the ocean-steamer, found ourselves here reduced to 
the depressing diet of a herring and pilot-bread. 
Captain Kidd, too, had suffered dumbly; even now 
he could not find comfort, but tried every plank in 
the deck, one after the other, circling round and 
round after his tail, dog-fashion, before lying down, 
and no sooner down than up again for another mel- 
ancholy wandering about the deck, another choice of 
planks, another circling, and another failure. We 
were sailing across a small lake whose smooth waters 
were like clear green oil ; as we drew near the out- 
let, the low, green shores curved inward and came to- 
gether, and the steamer entered a narrow, green river. 

" Here we are," said Eaymond. " Now we can soon 
land." 

" But there isn't any land," I answered. 

" What is that, then ? " asked my near-sighted com- 
panion, pointing toward what seemed a shore.
