denied his last rites and resting-place. 
" All which," as Prince begs us to "make 
a note of," " Confirms the Observation, 
 

That Evil Manners are often the Parent 
of Good Laws." 

It were a pert and presumptuous pen 
which would attempt a description of 
Bideford after Kingsley has ticketed it 
with missal script, and laid it away for 
all time, in library records, as " the little 
white town . . . which slopes upwards 
from its broad tide-river paved with yel- 
low sands, and many-arched old bridge 
where salmon wait for autumn floods, 
toward the pleasant upland on the west. 
Above the town the hills close in, cush- 
ioned with deep oak woods, through 
which juts here and there a crag of fern- 
fringed slate; below they lower, and 
open more and more in softly-rounded 
knolls and fertile squares of red and 
green, till they sink into the wide ex- 
panse of hazy flats, rich salt-marshes, 
and rolling sand-hills, where Torridge 
joins her sister Taw, and both together 
flow quietly toward the broad surges of 
the bar, and the everlasting thunder of 
the long Atlantic swell." But the trav- 
eler who arrives there with the begin- 
ning of " Westward Ho ! " warm in the 
memory will recall that, in the year 1575, 
Amyas Leigh, wandering home from 

school along the quay, by the taverns 
that lined the High Street, met there 
two men telling strange tales of the gold 
and gems of the New World, and the 
marvelous adventures attendant on their 
quest. These were Mr. John Oxenham, 
of whose family Devonshire traditions 
contain curious mention, and Salvation 
Yeo. That the latter was a true Devon- 
shire name " the bricks are alive to this 
day to testify ; '' for in Bideford town I 
saw it, not many months ago, on a pro- 
saic and humble signboard. But though 
syllables may defy the lapse of time, the 
ancient taverns are gone, and the High 
Street is a busy course of trade. Even 
the old church, where Amyas and his 
brother mariners gave thanks after their 
wonderful voyage with Drake, has made 
place for a new one. Only the muddy 
Torridge flows daily in and out, alternat- 
ing in yellow flats and dimpling water, 
and Bideford bridge stands proud and 
firm in the very outlines it wore when 
the lad Amyas begged of Salvation Yeo 
his carven horn. So old is this historic 
bridge that no man knoweth the date 
of its building. The most ancient ex- 
isting seal of Bideford borough, dating 
 

from the fourteenth century, bears its 
portrait; therefore must it have been 
silive and in good and honorable stand- 
ing at that day. Its origin, like that 
of all truly self-respecting structures 
in Great Britain, is supernatural. It is 
recorded that the river was long ago 
crossed by a ford so dangerous that no 
stones could be laid there with any hope 
of permanence. Finally, however, the 
parish priest was told in a dream that a 
stone had been moved to a desirable 
spot in the stream, and there should the 
bridge be built. So this holy medium of 
communication 'twixt Heaven and Bide- 
f ord. Sir Richard Gomard, or Gurney, re- 
vealed his vision to the bishop, who was 
pleased to "send forth indulgences and 
licenses" in order to enlist the good 
offices of his flock. They, obedient 
souls, gave abundantly, each according 
to his means. Many contributed money ; 
the rich gave lands and the labor of 
their workmen, and the poor cheerfully 
ofifered the work of their hands, some 
for a week, and others, more prosperous 
or more zealous, for a month. That the 
succeeding bishops had the bridge's wel- 
fare in mind is indicated by the fact that 


announcement was made not only from 
the cathedral church of Exeter, but 
throughout the diocese of Devonshire 
and Cornwall, that those who would 
promote and encourage this work " should 
participate in all spiritual blessings for- 
ever." No wonder that the bridge be- 
came so rich as to hold its head high, 
and bear itself with the dignity of a 
landed proprietor, becoming, first and 
last, " an inspired bridge, a soul-saving 
bridge, an alms-giving bridge, an educa- 
tional bridge, a sentient bridge, and last, 
but not least, a dinner-giving bridge." 

It was to the Grenviles that Bide- 
ford owed its early prosperity. The 
first Grenvile of Bideford was a cousin 
of the Conqueror ; but the bright star of 
that heroic family remains Sir Richard, 
whose prowess is sung by every chanter 
of Devon's fame, and who departed this 
life in a swiftly-traced but ever-during 
track of glory. For in the Revenge, off 
Flores, with a hundred and twenty men, 
he fought the Spanish fleet of fifty sail 
and ten thousand men, from three in 
the afternoon till daybreak next morn- 
ing. But when, in that fury of battle, 
more than a thousand of the enemy were 
 

slain, while the Revenge lost but forty, 
when his boat was riddled through and 
through, and he himself was wounded, 
he would fain have blown up the vessel, 
and was forced to surrender only through 
want of ammunition. Three days after, 
he died of his wounds, saying in Span- 
ish, that his captors might understand 
and know themselves defied to the last, 
" Here die I, Richard Grenvile, with a 
joyful and quiet mind, for that I have 
ended my life as a good soldier ought to 
do, who has fought for his country and 
his queen, for honor and religion." 

Such was Richard Grenvile, who walks 
through " Westward Ho ! " and the pages 
of less poetic history " a wise and gallant 
gentleman, lovely to all good men, awful 
to all bad men : in whose presence none 
dare say or do a mean or a ribald thing ; 
whom brave men left, feeling themselves 
nerved to do their duty better, while 
cowards slipped away, as bats arid owls 
before the sun." Well is he remembpred 
as " the great Sir Richard, the pride of 
North Devon." 

Kingsley's authority has been ques- 
tioned for making Bideford one of Eng- 
land's chief ports in the sixteenth cen- 
 

tury, though its halcyon days, beginning 
under Elizabeth, rapidly brightened, 
until its commerce with America and 
Newfoundland became exceeding great. 
French and Spanish privateers found 
Bideford ships such rich booty that they 
seized them in the very offing of the 
Taw and Torridge, and ironically named 
the spot " Golden Bay." But such flour- 
ishing of commerce is a thing of the past, 
for now the shipping trade of the Tor- 
ridge is conducted mainly at the neigh- 
boring town of Appledore. Burrough 
in Northam, where Kingsley fixed the 
home of Amyas Leigh, has been for 
centuries the seat of a family of the 
name of Leigh, two of whom were sea- 
faring men, and one, in Elizabeth's time, 
" Chief Pilot of England/' A member 
of a luckless expedition to the Arctic 
seas in the sixteenth century, he daringly 
continued his voyage, even though a 
companion ship was separated from him 
by wind and weather. On he sailed 
into the north, the region of perpetual 
mystery, and, most undaunted of pio- 
neers, entered the White Sea, naming 
the North Cape by the way. Again, in 
an insignificant vessel with a tiny crew, 
 

he sailed triumphantly to a point within 
the Kara Sea, "beyond which," says 
Prince, "no navigator went until our 
own day." Truly Amyas the giant came 
of a goodly race, and one whose tradi- 
tions bound him to heroic deeds. 

Near the mouth of the Torridge lies a 
delightfully clean little town, a seaside 
resort of some pretension. This is West- 
ward Ho, born of the great book to 
which the region is yearly indebted for 
crowding visitors. Though the town is 
modern, even amazingly so among such 
surroundings, its near neighbor is as old 
as â€” what i Let geology tell us. I had 
sdmost said, in the ignorant enthusiasm 
of the unscientific pilgrim, "as old as 
Adam." This neighbor is the Pebble 
Ridge, whose moaning told poor Mrs. 
Leigh, three miles away in Bideford 
town, that the sea and winds were rap- 
idly rising, and that her boy, on his way 
to Ireland, would not sleep that night. 
The Ridge is simply a wide beach heaped 
with pebbles, the smallest larger than 
the fist, and on the day of my pilgrimage 
lying at rest beside a calm sea and under 
a smiling sky. But it is easily to be 
guessed that when the demons of air and 
 

water strive together, these missiles of 
the deep, wet with ocean spume, are cast 
mightily upon one another, until they 
rattle like the fetters of giants captive. 
Behind them lie Northam Burrows, broad, 
smiling expanses clothed with coarse 
grass, and delightful to the British golfer, 
who there amuses himself religiously, 
quite as the Armada captains played at 
skittles on the Hoe. Is it beyond pos- 
sibility that, in our own " empty day," 
some game of golf may be historic ? 

When and where shall the pilgrim 
content himself.? Shall he follow the 
uttermost traces of those he would fain 
have known, and, knowing, offered rev- 
erence, even when the present fails to 
copy fair the past i If he elect to do so, 
then may he seek Freshwater at Clovelly, 
where " Irish ffoxe came out of rocks," 
to lose his brush of self-sufficiency, de- 
spoiled by giant Amyas ; yet here he will 
find but slender trickling of the stream 
of clear water, and slight reminder of 
such shy quarry, so peaceful is the scene. 
He may religiously visit Marsland Mouth, 
where lived Lucy Passmore, the "white 
witch," to find it a Devonshire combe, 
full of every-day contentment ; or he may 
 

traverse Dartmoor, and put the finger of 
fancy on the very spot where Ssilvation 
Yeo slew the king of the Gubbings. 
Time and enthusiasm must direct him, 
but he can scarcely be disappointed in 
any Devonian quest, even where he looks 
for castle or hovel, and finds not one 
stone left upon another ; for always and 
everywhere are the changeful skies, 
warm cliffs, and smiling or tempestuous 
sea ; everywhere his hope will be set in 
the gold of trefoil or the rose of heather. 
Devonshire herself has not waxed old 
nor faded, and in holding her warm hand 
and gazing into her true eyes he may 
comfort himself with the certainty that 
even so was she in those yesterdays 
made for the building of great epics. 
 

It was during my first summer's travel 
in Great Britain, now sojourning in hotels 
where milk was cream and the butter 
overlaid with gold, and again purringly 
content in the humblest of lodgings, that 
I chanced, at Ilfracombe, to secure a bed- 
room over a dairyman's shop. The finger 
of fate was in this ; for, passing through 
the shop in search of adventure without, 
I espied near the doorway a large wooden 
box marked distinctly " Ridd." To see 
was figuratively to pounce upon this auto- 
graphic trace of friend and hero. 

" Now, who is Ridd  quoth I, point- 
ing a dramatic finger at the legend. 

" John Ridd, miss ? " quaked the 
shopman, consciously innocent and yet 
alarmed, viewing the box as it might be 
a forerunner of November Fifth. " He 
sends it in full of eggs, miss ; and it goes 
back to him for more." 

"But who is John Ridd.? Is he a 
giant.? Does he dearly love collops of 
venison ? Did he marry " â€” 
 

" Bless you, miss!" interrupted my 
shopman, "all amort:" "he's a dairy- 
man ; but he 's nowise remarkable." 

This was the first faint footprint of 
Loma's John on Devonshire sand : and 
it greatly inflamed the mind with desire 
of an extended pilgrimage, wherein Lyn- 
ton, famed among the jewels of Devon, 
should be the initial point. Possibly 
the enthusiast who works by rule and 
compass would have traced the honest 
yeoman's career, from its beginning at 
Blundell School across the moor to 
Plover's Barrows (even, with painstaking 
exactitude, locating the Dulverton pump, 
where he dodged a kiss), thence to his 
meeting with Loma, and so on to Lon- 
don Town ; but something must at times 
be sacrificed to the common -sense of 
travel, and thus it was that we made our 
path in a measure straight. 

Lynton has been a thousand times 
lauded in breathless interjections, by 
sounding paragraphs ; but it remains the 
despair of word-imagery. The town is 
builded upon a wood-covered height, 
flanked behind by rolling tors, unlimited 
even by the far distance ; and four hun- 
dred feet below, approached either by 
 

the lift or a steep, winding track, lies the 
little harbor of Lynmouth, cherisher of 
the noisy Lyn stream running thereby 
and clamoring for the sea. More like 
far-famed Clovelly than any sister town, 
Lynmouth has chosen foothold in a cleft 
of mighty crags. Majestically they tower 
above her, while she broods in peace at 
the water gate, guarded in friendly fash- 
ion by a quaint Rhenish tower, erected 
solely for the delight of artistic eyes. 
At a distance of something more than 
a mile from Lynton is the Valley of 
Rocks, to be approached, if the traveler 
is truly wise, only by the cliff walk, â€” a 
footpath cut in the living rock and, faith- 
fully rendered by its name, on the very 
face of the cliff. An enchanted way, it 
leads on and on, through almost impos- 
sible glories of color and light. Below, 
a sheer descent to the sea, stretches the 
cliff. Above, also, it towers inaccessible, 
carpeted everywhere with a wondrous 
richness of growth. Heather smiles in 
roseate purple, gorse glows resplendent, 
and a certain nodding fairy bell intensi- 
fies the upper blue. At the right, looking 
Lynmouth way, a huge cliff or foreland 
sweeps into the sea, "one entire and 
 

perfect chrysolite " in gemlike coloring. 
Rich browns shade into purple and rose- 
red ; and, at those gala moments when 
the sunset glory is supreme, the bare 
rock throbs and palpitates in almost 
breathing beauty. On one late afternoon, 
marked forever by a red letter in the 
missal of the year, the sky was as a shell, 
pink-tinted, lustrous. The sea snatched 
its hues, and threw them back in shim- 
mering splendor. The great cliff shone 
in glory ; and the watcher, poised upon 
his meagre eyrie, might almost forget 
the ground above and beneath, and 
imagine himself some happy dweller in 
the air, nourished by light and breath- 
ing only color. Following this heavenly 
way along the curving cliff, the traveler 
suddenly turns a corner, and enters the 
valley itself. At first, remembering the 
stupendous descriptions hung upon its 
fame, he is disappointed ; but gradually 
the true grandeur of the rocky waste 
insists upon its own significance. A 
valley of some extent, flanked by hills 
and to-day traversed by a road, it is 
green with bracken and sterile under 
stone. Everywhere obtrudes the un- 
yielding rock, in bits fit for a giant's 
 

missile, in massive and uncouth forma- 
tion, like chaotic dwellings. Two such 
rocky citadels, grotesque, tremendous, 
attract and hold the eye. These are 
Castle Rock and the Devil's Cheese-ring 
(the latter word, according to some, sig- 
nifying cheese-knife or scoop). Tradition 
still declares that in this eerie spot the 
witch, Mabel Durham, or, as the name 
was corrupted, Mother Melldrum, had 
her abode, or possibly her rendezvous; 
and thither came John Ridd to seek her. 
Wise Mother Melldrum ! She knew the 
full value of scene-setting and accessories. 
Even the valiant John found himself 
depressed by the gloom of her surround- 
ings, though he had previously consid- 
ered the place " nothing to frighten 
anybody, unless he had lived in a gal- 
lipot." His nerves were as the bass 
string, and not the treble ; but among the 
suppliants for her uncanny aid there 
must have been those who here quivered 
and quaked in awe of the sorcerer Nature, 
if not the human witch. 

To extend one's walk along the valley 
and through the hospitable gate of Lee 
Abbey is to turn a page of romantic his- 
tory. This estate was some time the 
 

residence of the De Whichehalse family, 
Flemish refugees, whose line ended in 
revolt against the English crown. One 
spot in the grounds furnishes the initial 
note to this tragic history, â€” a cliff over- 
hanging the shore, and still known as 
Jennifred's Leap. Jennifred, according 
to the story, was beloved and deserted 
by Lord Auberley ; and, like Ophelia^ she 
could not survive the outrage of her 
maiden dream. One night she wandered 
away from the house, and next morning 
had not returned. Search waxed hot 
and frantic ; and at length they found 
her, happily dead, at the foot of the cliff 
where she had cast herself in heroic de- 
spair. Her father sought King James for 
justice against the recreant lover; but 
Auberley stood high in court favor, and 
the royal coward declared his inability to 
judge between them. Then came Mon- 
mouth's Rebellion ; and De Whiche- 
halse, burning for revenge, repudiated 
the royal party, and sought the woman- 
slayer in the ranks of its army, met him 
face to face, and struck him dead. The 
battle of Sedgemoor followed ; and De 
Whichehalse, like others of the defeated, 
attempted flight to Holland, whereupon 
 

the winds swept down upon him and the 
sea rose, quenching his stormy life and 
passions forever. But the lover of that 
ideal which is forever satisfying, though 
the actual betray, will scarcely waste 
thought upon this righteous maid-aven- 
ger. Rather will he choose to smile over 
the memory of that Marwood de Whiche- 
halse who kissed pretty Annie at the 
door, and in payment for his whistle was 
so sturdily clouted by the giant John. 

When John Fry and his valiant little 
charge made their way across Exmoor, 
from Tiverton to Oare, they halted at 
Dulverton ; and there it was that the im- 
mortal "farm-hand" demanded "Hot 
mootton pasty for twoo trarv'lers, at 
number vaive, in vaive minutes ! " The 
coach road from Lynton thither is char- 
acteristic and satisfying; for on either 
side lies the moor, barren, brown, crack- 
ling with coarse grass diversified by 
patches of heather, "the green of bracken, 
the red of whortleberry," and tenanted, 
as of old, by ponies and red deer. It is 
like Dartmoor as one sister resembles an- 
other, and yet strangely individual and 
different. Dartmoor is broken by abrupt 
hills and gigantic rocky remains: Ex- 
 

moor sweeps away in rolling billows. In 
the deep glens at the foot of these enor- 
mous earth-ridges hasten clear streams 
of varying size, but all swarming with 
fish; for the moor is the "mother of 
manie rivers." Over the sides of the 
ridges themselves trickle swifter rills, in 
goyals or gullies, to join the torrent be- 
low, â€” in winter a torrent, indeed; for 
then such mountain waters throw aside 
the decorum of habit, and swollen by the 
early rains leap forth, destructive and 
dauntless, to meet the sea. But in the 
centre of the great tract, peopled every- 
where by thousands of sheep, lie its 
monotony and dreariness of waste moor- 
land. It is when they approach the sea 
that the great downs become majestic 
and truly satisfying. Then they drop 
suddenly hundreds of feet, cleft perhaps 
by a romantic fissure, where sweeps some 
rushing streamlet, foam-fringed and vo- 
cal. Here and there are bogs, but alas 
for the partisan who would fain shudder 
over the bones of Carver Doone bleaching 
' below the ooze ! Not one, says a cool and 
unsympathetic authority, is dangerous. 

"It always rains on Exmoor," runs 
a proverb; and the couplet defining 
 

Dunkery's barometric qualification, an- 
nounces with the eccentric rhyming of a 
weather distich, â€” 

" When Dunkery's top cannot be seen, 
Homer will have a flooded stream." 

Clouds are the hourly attendants of an 
Exmoor sky ; but, when they lower on 
Dunkery, then the rain may be said to 
have given official warning of its ap- 
proach. To climb this beacon hill with- 
out a guide is to suffer some diminution 
of spiritual vainglory, unless, indeed, the 
gods go with you every step. The pleas- 
antest footway from Porlock leads, 
through the valley of the Horner, where 
that gurgling, shouting, utterly irrespon- 
sible water creature goes tumbling along 
over stone and shallow, slapping his 
sides, joking, singing, waking the valley 
to a madness of mirth. The air there is 
dark with " green things growing." You 
can scarcely make your way for love of 
the thickening leaves on either hand. 
Everywhere is the beauty woven out of 
ferns and brawling waters. Crossing the 
stream is by a foot-bridge made of one 
timber and a narrow hand-rail. Then 
you begin climbing, and perhaps like us 
find yourself, quite out of breath and be- 
 

wildered, in an upland open, apparently 
on the way to nowhere. In better 
company than the king of France, we 
marched down again, mounted another 
height and knew only that Exmoor was 
about us and that we were plainly lost. 
I have little remembrance of that day, 
save that it was full of hot sun and 
winy airs; that somehow the sound of 
an axe led us into a wood, where the 
chopper, surprised at visitors in his sleep- 
ing world, directed us profusely. All 
his conflicting testimony ended to the 
time of : " and that will be Dunkery, 
and you 'll know it by the b'acon." 
Then, obedient, we struck into a way 
across the moor. The road rose and 
sank with the billowing hills. A little 
hamlet glanced out now and then, far 
away in a dream. The sky smiled bril- 
liantly without a cloud, and scanning it 
for the beacon, my eyes looked always 
across a black bar where the bright 
horizon line had struck them. The hills 
were alike, delusive in their sameness. 
At length one waving outline seemed to 
be broken by a knot, a flaw. Surely the 
beacon! No path pointed thither, and 
we struck into wild land where the 

heather was knee-deep, husky to the ear. 
When one of us lay down to rest, the 
warm scrubby growth closed over her ; 
and the other, looking back, saw only 
the sky, the rolling slopes, the few nib- 
bling sheep, and drank of wonder, find- 
ing herself alone on this great ball, the 
earth. The soul must be hide-bound 
indeed, if in such space she will not 
grow. 

At last we were there, â€” on Dunkery, 
with her distinguishing cairn, her vantage 
over purpling wastes and love-looks at 
the ample sky, and we went back again 
through the heather. There were seven 
hours of it in all before home and rest : 
seven hours without food. But we had 
eaten the air and thriven mightily. 

From Lynton to Simonsbath (still on 
the way to Dulverton) the road affords 
you truly typical Exmoor scenery, â€” 
bare, waste, and desolate. This is the 
county of the red deer, where he is yet 
hunted with the madness of enthusiasm 
described by Kingsley and Whyte-Mel- 
ville ; and the knowing tourist will scan 
the far sinuous horizon ,f or one glimpse 
of a delicate antlered head. Vain desire ! 
He is lying somewhere in covert, de- 
 

veloping his tactics for the next meet 
Then perchance he will slink into the 
lair of a young stag, and send him forth 
with a cruel push of resistless horns, to 
draw the sportsman's eye. If that avail 
not, he will seek some still watercourse, 
and there cool him in the stream before 
picking his dainty way over moss and 
pebble, â€” every step a move in the game 
of outwitting the hounds, his enemies to 
the death. But lay it not to heart, dear 
pilgrim, if the only four-footed beasties 
you find on Exmoor are ponies cropping 
the homely herbage : the deer are meat 
for our masters. 

Simonsbath is dignified by the usual 
quota of legend, though it happens to 
be of a rather fragmentary and common- 
place nature. The name is taken, says 
one tale, from a deep pool in the Barle, 
where Simon, an Exmoor outlaw of some 
unknown period, was accustomed to 
bathe. Another folk tradition connects 
it with King Sigmund, the dragon-slayer. 
But sufficient be it for us to remember, 
when we draw up in front of the William 
Rufus, a tavern in good and respectable 
standing to-day as it was two centuries 
ago, that this was the scene of one mar- 
 

velous escape ascribed to Tom Faggus. 
Here was he one night reveling when 
the authorities suddenly pounced upon 
him, â€” only to be outwitted, however; 
for Tom had but to leap on his half- 
human strawberry mare and ride away. 
J. LI. W. Page, lover of the moors of 
Exe and Dart, quotes, for the benefit of 
the imaginative, the tradition that the 
bog known as Claren Rocks, not far 
from Simonsbath, was the instrument of 
Carver Doone's tragic ending ; but, as he 
justly adds, a certain wet patch upon the 
side of Dunkery may, with equal likeli- 
hood, receive the popular vote. As in 
more vital matters, doctors disagree; 
and the hoarder of such uncertain detail 
might as well look about him, within the 
proper radius, and fix upon any bog even 
approximately answering the require- 
ments of fancy. The verdict has been 
given, the case dismissed: circumstan- 
tial evidence can do no harm. Beyond 
Simonsbath, the road becomes somewhat 
tame, in comparison with its previous 
mood; and at Dulverton itself, entered 
by a street so narrow that the houses 
seem inhospitably to elbow the passing 
coach, there is scanty interest for anti- 


quary and for "tripper." You may climb 
the hill behind the church and overlook 
the valley of the Barle, or you may drive 
through the wooded luxury of Earl Car- 
narvon's park ; but it must be confessed 
that the chief glory of the place lies now 
in the memory of John Fry's " hot moot- 
ton pasty' Not far away are the Tor 
Steps, near which Mother Melldrum set 
up her summer residence. A rude bridge 
made of stone slabs, placed upon piers 
and guiltless of cement, â€” this, it seems, 
was built by the devil for his own ex- 
clusive use. He threatened destruction 
to the first living creature crossing it, 
whereupon the parson, who was amaz- 
ingly clever in those days at outwitting 
the fiend, broke the spell by sending 
over " a harmless necessary cat." Pussy 
was torn piecemeal ; and then the parson 
himself crossed in safety, billingsgating 
the devil as he went. The dialogue on 
this memorable occasion must have been 
of the tu quoque order, inasmuch as the 
parson was called a "black crow," and 
avenged himself for the indignity offered 
his garb by retorting that he was "no 
blacker than the devil." Shrewd in 
tactics, it is evident that this good gentleman 
was yet a dullard at repartee, else 
would he have chosen some more biting 
rejoinder than " You 're another ! " 

Let no one contemplating the coach- 
ing trip to Dulverton be deceived by 
the announcement that the Doone Valley 
is among the attractions of the route; 
for this beguiling statement merely indi- 
cates that the driver, at a certain stage 
of the trip, will point vaguely into the 
purple distance, and remark that the 
Doone Valley is " there/' The greedy 
traveler, however, hardly needs to be 
told that he should take a carriage at 
Lynmouth, and make a canny bargain 
for a drive to the valley itself, â€” prefer- 
ably by the Countisbury Road, to return 
by way of Watersmeet, where the Combe 
Park and Farley Waters join the East 
Lyn with many sparkles of delight at 
the meeting and much pomp of fern- 
embroidered garment. (This, however, 
applies only to those who, like the 
Queen of Spain, have no legs. A 
walker will make it a day's excursion, 
thanking his luck for the chance.) Up 
and out into the clear air of heaven leads 
the Countisbury Road, skirting the very 
brow of sheer cliffs on one side, and 
 

smiled on by Exmoor from the inland 
distance. The blue sea and the shad- 
owy coast of Wales are the wayfarer's 
treasure-trove. Every breath is exhil- 
arating, sweet, instinct with beauty. 
Presently the road inclines downward 
and toward the right ; and Devonshire 
is left behind for the goodly county of 
Somerset, claimant also for the parent- 
age of the redoubtable John. ("Zum- 
merzett thou bee'st, Jan Ridd," said the 
popular voice on that side the line, " and 
Zummerzett thou shalt be.'') And be- 
fore reaching the goal of his desire, it 
shall befall the traveler to seek out Oare 
church, a tiny building with nave and 
chancel all complete, like a temple of 
Lilliput Land ; and there I wish him 
not too exhaustive a knowledge of what 
he is to find. For I, in entering, expected 
merely to drink from the cup of sweet 
memories, reflecting, " Here stood John 
with his Loma when Carver's shot came 
crashing in, charged with death to one 
and madness for her lover ; " but pure 
surprise chased such sentimental mus- 
ing from the field. Stepping within 
the nave, the previously uninstructed is 
amazed at certain tablets on the north 
 

wall ; for these perpetuate the memory 
of the Snowe family, to which Black- 
more has vouchsafed a long-lasting ten- 
ure of life, and one of them is even 
adorned by the name of Farmer Nicholas 
himself, though of another generation 
than John's old neighbor. The Snowes, 
so saith the chronicler, are worthy yeo- 
men who have held land in this region 
since the days of Alfred ; and this en- 
during brass doth so plainly resurrect 
them before the eye that one is tempted 
to subscribe then and there to a sober 
belief in all Blackmore's broidery of fact, 
asserting, " The bricks are alive at this 
day to testify it." 

Beyond Oare, the road is less diver- 
sified ; and at Malmsmead, a collection 
of two or three houses devoted, as by 
an irrevocable vow, to the upholding of 
Doone legends, you may take an Exmoor 
pony and ride along a sweetly sylvan 
path into the true valley. And here, at 
whatever season you go, so that green 
boughs be welcoming, it shall seem " the 
boyhood of the year ;'' for everywhere is 
budding or expanded growth, under dap- 
pling of shadow and flickering of light. 
After Blackmore's paean, all that one can 
 

say of the Doone Valley rings of bathos, 
the more lukewarm in proportion to its 
truth. For here, indeed, is the water- 
slide, a rocky incline covered by a thin 
streamlet, amicably flowing to meet the 
Bagworthy Water ; but it is by no means 
a way perilous, and its ascent need not 
have tired little John's stout muscles 
so sorely. The valley itself, broken by 
the desolate foundations of a few tiny 
huts, is hemmed in by moorland hills ; 
but, compared with a score of Exmoor's 
chasms and retreats, it is as Leah to 
Rachel. We are in the home of the 
Doones ; and very fair it is, with the 
summer sky above us and the whispering 
leaves at hand. But the magic picture 
of our search we shall by no means find, 
save between the covers of Blackmore's 
book wonderful. Learn, however, the 
sequel : forget not the epilogue ! For, 
when one has turned his back on this 
disappointing spot and taken his home- 
ward road, he cannot forbear exclama- 
tion, at more points than one, over the 
actual valley of his dreams. For the 
reality of that word-picture exists, though 
not where tradition has placed it. Here 
are steep inclines, hundreds of feet high, 
 

down which even the anguished red deer 
dare not hurl himself in his extremity 
of flight. Here are inaccessible gullies, 
foaming water, and fern -clad hollow. 
And thus it is that he who truly seeks 
will find, even though the prize be long 
deferred. 

There are few places in whose records 
I take more delight than in those of 
Tiverton and her Blundell School. Who 
that has the heart of youth does not re- 
call, with a responsive thrill, John Ridd's 
tale of the Blundell boys' heaven-sent 
holiday ? For " in the very front of the 
gate, just without the archway, where the 
ground is paved most handsomely, you 
may see in copy-letters done a great 
P. B. of white pebbles. Now it is the 
custom and the law that, when the in- 
vading waters, either fluxing along the 
wall from below the road-bridge or pour- 
ing sharply across the meadows from 
a cut called ' Owen's ditch,' â€” and I 
myself have seen it come both ways, â€” 
upon the very instant when the waxing 
element lips though it be but a single 
pebble of the founder's letters, it is in 
the license of any boy, so ever small and 
undoctrined, to rush into the great 
 

school-rooms, where a score of masters 
sit heavily, and scream at the top of his 
voice, ' P. B. ! ' 

" Then, with a yell, the boys leap up or 
break away from their standing. They 
toss their caps to the black-beamed roof, 
and haply the very books after them ; 
and the great boys vex no more the small 
ones, and the small boys stick up to the 
great ones. One with another, hard they 
go, to see the gain of the waters, . . . 
and are prone to kick the day-boys out, 
with words of scanty compliment. Then 
the masters look at one another, hav- 
ing no class to look to, and (boys being 
no more left to watch) in a manner they 
put their mouths up. With a spirited 
bang they close their books, and make 
invitation, the one to the other, for pipes 
and foreign cordials, recommending the 
chance of the time and the comfort away 
from cold water."
