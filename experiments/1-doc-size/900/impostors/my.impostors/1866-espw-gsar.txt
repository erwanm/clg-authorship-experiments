has no mother, Gypsy, he must have that 
sister.” 

Gypsy raised her head, her tears quite gone, 
and said, speaking very solemnly, — 

“ Mother, whether you live or whether you 
die, I will be that sister.” 

That promise, made in the dim light of the 
sick-room, with the shadows nodding on the 
walls, and the shadow of the poor thin face 
beside her on the pillow, Gypsy will never 
forget. 

But God was merciful, and she did not die ; 
and if she had. He would have been merciful 
still. To no one in the family was the experience
of those few weeks what it was to Gypsy. 
For the first time in her life she had looked into 
an open grave ; — for we never know nor can 
know what the words mean until we see one 
waiting for us or ours; — for the first time in 
her life she had felt that any one very dear to 
her coitld die and life go on, and the future 
come, with always a face in it to be missed, and 
a touch to be longed for. For the first time in 



her life, too, she had found out what it was to 
be very thankful; to fall on her knees with 
hidden face, the happy words dying on her 
lips for wonder that God should choose her for 
such rich blessing. 

Many times in these days she thought of 
her cousin Joy and her motherless life. She 
thought that she had understood it before, but 
now she found that she never had. She wrote 
to Joy once and told her so. 

But the fever had done its work thoroughly, 
and Mrs. Breynton did not recover as fast as 
they had hoped. She seemed to be very much 
shattered by it, and it was many weeks before 
she was able to leave her bed. After the 
watchers had been given up, and the nurses 
had gone, and the neighbours began to come 
in less frequently to offer help, Gypsy was busy 
enough. And it was then that there came the 
trial to her patience and good temper. She 
must be nurse, and she must be housekeeper; 
she must look after Winnie, — and it did seem 
as if that young gentleman made it a serious 

study to require looking after at least once in 
every five minutes ; she must try to make 
things pleasant for her father, and she must 
write to Tom. Here lay the rub. It was 
almost impossible to get time to do it. Her 
mother’s toast must be made, and her father’s 
stockings must be darned ; Patty, driven with 
the extra work, must be helped to set the 
table and wash the dishes ; Winnie must be 
picked out of the hogshead and the flour-barrel 
and the coal-bin, cajoled away from the mo- 
lasses-jug, washed and brushed and mended, 
respectfully entreated not to stamp through 
the garret floor while mother was sleeping, 
and coerced into desisting from pounding 
Patty with the broom-handle and two pokers. 
And writing to Tom was obviously more 
pleasant. 

We cannot always do our sowing where we 
like and as we like; Providence sometimes 
ploughs a rut for us, and all we have to do is to 
walk in it ; Gypsy found this out before her 
mother had been sick a month. 



But there is almost always a gust of wind or 
a bird to scatter the grain a little. 

Several years after, Gypsy was one day looking 
over Tom’s desk for an envelope, when she 
came to some bits of paper carefully folded by 
themselves. Seeing the handwriting she pulled 
them out. 

“Why, Tom Breynton ! you never kept 
these all this time ! ” 

“ Rather guess I did, and I wouldn’t part 
with them for a good deal ; I ’d rather lose all 
your other letters first. Didn’t I know well 
enough how you used to write them when you 
ought to be abed, and how tired you were, and 
hurried and bothered? Well, I guess I did; 
here, put them back where you found them. 
Miss! ” 

They were the tiny notes and scraps of mes- 
sages which Gypsy had written while her 
mother was sick. 

“ Gypsy,” said Winnie one day, stamping 
into the room, slamming the door, upsetting two 
chairs and a table, just as Gypsy had drawn the 


shutters for her mother’s afternoon nap, 
“where’s my shaving-brush, I ’d like to know? 
I didn’t shaved this week, nor last month, and 



father shaves every day, and you don’t know 
anything about it, ’cause you ’re a girl. Now 
where is it, sir?’’ 

“ Oh, dear,” said Gypsy, hushing him up, 

I did hope you ’d forget that brush. You ’ve 
brushed your teeth and your shoes and your 
hair with it, besides using it to paint the looking-glass 
with flour paste, and rub vinegar all 
over the cat, and — ” 

Winnie interrupted by severely signifying that 
what he had done with it, or was going to do 
with it, was of no consequence : he should like 
the brush ; “ if he didn’t have that brush, he 'd 
squeal, he ’d stamp, he ’d pound, he ’d thump, 
he ’d holler awful ; would she let him have the 
brush ? ” 

It was the only way of getting rid of him 
without a battle ; so she took the brush from its 
hiding-place on the mantel, and Winnie stamped 
off triumphant. 

He came to supper with a very red face. 

“What is the matter?” asked Gyp.sy. 

“ Oh, nothin’, only I ’ve been shaving,” said 
Winnie, rubbing his cheeks. “ I didn’t s’pose 
it was going to hurt.” 

“ Hurt? How? What did you shave 
with?” 



“With a brush, of course; you do ask such 
stupid questions, Gypsy Breynton ! ” 

“ Anything besides the brush?” 

“ Oh, nothing but a case-knife ; it was an all- 
notched-up case-knife, too ; Patty wouldn’t give 
me a nice one, — the old thing! ” 

When Winnie had been in bed about fifteen 
minutes that night, there suddenly uprose an 
utterly indescribable shriek, as of one who had 
been controlling his emotions to the verge of 
human endurance. 

Gypsy rushed up stairs. 

“ Why, Winnie Breynton I what has hap- 
pened ? ” 

“ They hur-r-rt ! ” sobbed Winnie, who was 
holding on to his cheeks with both hands. 
“ They hurt dreadful, and I wasn’t goin’ to — 
tell, ’cause father and Tom — never — do ! ” 

“ Winnie, what did you shave with, I should 
like to know? ” 

“ Water.” 

“ Nothing else?” 

No, there was nothing else. What did he 


put the water in? An old peach-can that he 
found on the shelf. 

“ On the shelf in the pantry? — the lower 
shelf? ’’ 

“Yes. I don’t see what there is to laugh at, 
either.” 

Gypsy did her best, but she could not 
help it. 

“ Oh, Winnie Breynton ! I ’d been using it 
to make mother’s mustard-paste ! ” 





MS. BREYNTON did not be- 
come well fast. It took her a 
long time to get out of bed, a long time to 
get downstairs, a long time to get out of 
doors. “ It was an obstinate case,” repeated 
the doctor, peering mysteriously at her through 
his glasses, “ and she had very little vitality in 
rallying from it, very little vitality.” Gypsy 
said, “ Yes, sir,” with a remarkably vague idea 
what he was talking about, and Winnie wanted 
to know if vitality meant whiskers. 

In fact, it ended in Mrs. Breynton’s becoming 
a confirmed invalid for the winter, very easily 


excited, and much injured by excitement; very 
dependent on rest and quiet, and having things 
cheerful about her. Thus the family fell into 
the way of telling her the brightest side of 
everything, and bearing their little anxieties 
without her, and thus it came about that 
she never knew of something which Gypsy 
did when the college term was about two 
thirds through. 

She had been down to the office one day to 
carry a letter to Tom from Winnie. Winnie 
was under the ignominious necessity of getting 
some one else to write his letters, but he made 
up for it by originality of material. This 
particular letter ran as follows : — 

“Tell him I want him to brine: me some 
peanuts and candy, sir, and if he can’t afford it, 
he need n’t, and I want him to bring me two 
pounds of peanuts and candy. My whiskers 
don’t grow very fast. Why don’t they? I 
shaved them one time with the mustard-box. 

I squealed that night, too. I smash my potatoes 
myself, to dinner. I like to do it with the napkin- 
ring, but Gypsy she won’t let me. I know how 
to tie my shoe-strings in a hard knot, too. 
Mother’s an infidel, and stays in her room 
pretty much. Nothing else that I can think 
of. This is from Winnie Breynton, Esq., sir.” 

Gypsy found in the box 
a letter for herself. It was 
from Tom. She was a little 
surprised, for she had heard 
from him only two days 
before. She read it on the 
way home, folded it with a 
grieved and puzzled face, 
put it in her pocket, and 
said nothing about it to 
any one. It was no wonder 
that she was grieved and 
puzzled. 

Mv Jewel of a Gypsy, — I made a rush 
in Greek yesterday, and the Sophs are behav- 
ing better than they did. Hall came very near 
getting into trouble with Tutor U., but begged 

off. I hope mother is better, and that you have 
gone back to school. Did I ever tell you how 
much everybody admires your mark in my 
Bible? I keep it on the table so they can 
sec it. 

Look here, Gyp. I ’ve got into a little fix. 
My funds were low, — very low, — decidedly 
minus, in fact, though I am sure I cannot tell 
where it is all gone to, and I borrowed a few 
dollars of one of the fellows, and expected to 
pay it back before now ; but father says that 
what I had, ought to have lasted till the end of 
the term, and he was so vexed (though I didn’t 
tell him what I wanted it for), and hammers at 
me so for being extravagant, that I can’t apply 
to him. I know I ’ve spent too much, and I 
suppose he gives me all he can afford. I don’t 
want to talk against him, for I suppose this way 
he has is mostly because he thinks so much of 
us, and I know I ’ve made him trouble enough ; 
but I don’t dare to have him know about this. 
The fellow wants the money, and has a right to 
it. It will be a disgrace to me if I don’t pay 
before long ; he won’t hold his tongue, for he is 
mad about it. Can you think of any way I can 
get out of it? Could you get something from 
mother? I would not write to her, for I did 
not know but she was too sick. It goes tough 
to have her know, anyway. Don’t tell her, if it 
will do her any hurt. Didn’t mean ever to have 
to come to you about such a scrape again, and 
I haven’t paid back your four dollars yet, either. 
But, to tell the truth, it is a serious fix. I 
wonder you are not tired to death of being 
bothered by 

Your graceless brother, 

Tom. 

Gypsy did not know what to do. She lay 
awake a long time that night, thinking about 
it, her merry brows knotted and her red lips 
drawn into a sorrowful curve. And what she 
thought was this : — 

Tom must have the money. It was too bad, 
— terribly too bad, that he should keep making 
such good resolves and then forgetting them. 

Me ought not to have borrowed ; he ought 
not to have needed to borrow ; but he must 
have the money. If he should not have it, she 
did not know exactly what would happen, but 
he certainly intimated that it would be something
very bad. At least he would be disgraced, 
and whatever that might mean, it would be 
dreadful to have Tom disgraced. She con- 
cluded that they would probably send him to 
prison. In all the story-books, people went to 
prison for debt. And to think of Tom in 
prison ! No, he must have the money at any 
cost. 

This was very easy to say ; the thing was, to 
get it. She had none of her own ; she had 
lent it all to him before. Of course she could 
not go to her father. Telling her mother was 
not to be thought of; the excitement and pain 
would throw her back a fortnight. Peace May- 
thornc could be no help. What was to be 
done? She tossed about on the bed till eleven 
o’clock, and was no nearer answering the question
than she was at nine. So she went to 


sleep on it. About midnight she woke up 

suddenly, and thought of something. She jumped 
up in the dark and ran to her upper bureau 
drawer, and pulled it out with a jerk. She 
took out a little 
box, and sat down 
on the floor by the 
window, in the pale 
starlight, and opened 
it. It was a pretty 
box, of cedar-wood, 
inlaid with pearl lilies, 
and was lined with 
soft pink cotton. It 

held all Gypsy’s jewelry. “ All ” was very 
little to be sure, but 
some of it was quite 
pretty. There was a cameo pin, — her best 
one, — with a Beatrice’s head on it; there was 
a tiny gold cross that she sometimes wore 
around her neck; a coral bracelet fastened by 
a gold snake, made out of the sleeve-clasps 


which she had worn when she was a baby ; a 
battered gold heart intended to slip on one of 
the old-fashioned watch-guards ; two gold buttons 
that one of her aunts had given her several 
years ago ; a lava stud, and a number of rings. 
These rings ran very much to cornelian and 
gutta-percha, but there were two handsome 
ones. One had been her mother’s when she 
was a girl, and was sealed by the least bit of 
an opal on a gold leaf ; this Gypsy wore only 
on state occasions. The other, her Uncle George 
had given her ; it was a circle of elaborate 
chasing, and had been originally a very pretty 
ring. But she had lost it once in the garden, 
and when it was found, months after, it was 
tarnished and bent, and had lain on the pink 
cotton in that condition ever since. When 
Gypsy had looked all the things over, she took 
out this ring, the battered heart, the two gold 
buttons, and the lava stud, and turned them 
about in her fingers, hesitating. 

“ I never wear these,” she said, half aloud, 
“ and nobody will ever suspect or wonder, or 


ask where they ’re gone to ; Joy might, if she 
were here, but she isn’t. And I am sure they 
must be worth as much as ten dollars, and — 
yes. I’ll do it.” 

After that she put away the pearl-inlaid box 
and went to bed, and thought how much she 
was like the girls in the story-books. 

It chanced that Mr. Breynton was in Bur- 
lington for a day or two on business, and 
Gypsy hesitated a little about what she said 
to her mother the next day, but remembered
that Tom was in a hurry, and finally 
said it. 

Mother, I have been thinking I should like 
to go over to Vergennes this noon, and match 
the worsteds for your camp-chair.” 

“ To-day, Gypsy? ” 

“Yes’m; it is such a perfect day for it, and 
Mr. Surly says it is going to snow to-morrow. 
The only thing is, leaving you without father 
here. I don’t exactly want to.” 

“ Oh, I don’t care. It will only be a few 
hours, and I don’t need anything but what 


Patty can do for me. If you want to go, you 
had better.” 

Now, if there had been nothing but the 
worsteds or her own pleasure concerned, Gypsy 
would not have thought of going till her father 
was at home. But something more important 
than worsteds or pleasure was concerned, and 
she accepted the permission with a readiness 
that was very unlike Gypsy ; for she had been 
very generous and thoughtful ; quick to deny 
herself anything and everything, since her 
mother’s illness. Mrs. Breynton, though she 
really did not need her, noticed the difference, 
and Gypsy felt that she did, and being unable 
to explain it, was the hardest thing about this 
Vergennes undertaking. 

She started in the noon train, with a very 
stout-looking purse in her pocket, and one hand 
holding it tight. It held her money, — change 
for her fare and bills for her worsteds, — and it 
also held a battered heart, a ring, two buttons, 
and a lava stud. 

It was a bright, bleak, winter day ; the sun 


on the snow dazzled her, and the wind blew 
sharply into her face as she stepped from the 
cars and began to wander about the streets of 
Vergennes. She did not know exactly where 
to go with her jewelry, and now that it had 
come to the point, she dreaded selling it. It 
was an unpleasant thing to do. It had a mean 
look, she thought; she was not poorly dressed, 
and they would never guess that she could 
really need the money, and certainly never guess 
what it was for. Besides, she felt uneasy about 
doing such a thing without her mother’s knowl- 
edge. She wished for the twentieth time that 
Tom had not run in debt. However, it was 
rather late in the day to begin to be discouraged ;
so, after she had bought her worsteds, 
remembering that the girls in the story-books 
always took their jewelry to a pawnbroker’s, 
she stopped the first man she met, and asked 
him if he could tell her where there was a 
pawnbroker’s shop. The man put his hands 
in his pockets, and his hat on one side of his 
head, and stared, — at her face, the feather in 


her hat, her pretty cashmere dress, her ladylike 
muff, her neatly gloved hands, and said : — 

“ Dew tell, now ! ” 

“ Can you tell me where there is a pawn- 
broker’s, sir ? ” repeated Gypsy, reddening. “I 
want to sell some jewelry.” 

“Wall, I never! ” said the man; don’t 

want nary pawnbroker. Jewellers is the place 
fur sech pooty little gals. You ’ll find one right 
round the corner; very genteel jeweller, and 
fust cousin of mine, too.” 

Gypsy thanked him, and walked away as fast 
as she could. The “ fust cousin ” proved to be 
a little man with a black moustache. Whether 
his claims to gentility lay in that, or in his blue 
satin vest and flaring purple scarf-pin, or in his 
dingy, dusty shop, or in his stock of flashy 
jewelry, — largely consisting of brass and 
paste, — was not quite clear to the inquiring 
mind. Gypsy looked about her, and was sorry 
that she had come. 

“ What will you have to-day, ma’am?” asked 
the jeweller, promptly ; “ ear-rings, bracelets, — 



finest Etruscan gold, them bracelets, — fine 
assortment of diamonds, stone cameos, and this 
ruby, ma’am, — the genooine article, worth fifty 
dollars if it ’s worth a copper, but seeing it ’s you, 
now, I ’ll let you have it for a song, — I ’ll say 
ten dollars, and that ’ll be throwin’ of it away.” 

“ Oh, I wouldn’t have you throw it away on 
me, I ’m sure,” said Gypsy, with mischief in 
her eyes. “ I don’t exactly see how you could 
afford to lose forty dollars on it either. 
Besides, I didn’t come to buy anything. I came 
to sell some jewelry.” 

“Oh, you did, did you?” said the jeweller, 
with a sudden change of tone; “well, I don’t 
do much in that line. I sometimes take folks’ 
old silver and such to oblige ’em, but it isn’t 
worth nothing to me.” 

Gypsy had opened her purse, and the trinkets 
fell out upon the glass show-case. She spread 
them out, and asked how much he was willing 
to give her. The jeweller looked them over 
with ill-concealed eagerness, and took them up 
with masterly indifference. 




“ Hum ! — look as if they ’d been through the 
wars ; if I was to give you seventy-five cents 
for ’em, it would be more than they ’re worth.” 

“ Seventy-five cents ! ” exclaimed Gypsy ; 
“ why, I wouldn’t sell one of the buttons for 
that,” and she began to put them back in her 
purse. 

“Well, say a dollar, then; come now, that’s 
fair.” 

“ No, sir, I don’t think it is fair at all,” said 
Gypsy, shutting up her purse very fast. 

“ Dollar and a quarter, then, — call it a bar- 
gain.” But Gypsy walked right out of the 
shop. 

She strolled about awhile, feeling discouraged 
enough, but, Gypsy-like, more provoked that 
anybody should try to cheat her, till at last she 
stumbled upon another jeweller’s, — a handsome 
store, large and clean and well-lighted, with a 
display of watches and silver in the windows. 
So she pulled out her purse again and went in. 

There was a well-dressed man behind the 
counter, who had a very singular smile. Gypsy 


noticed it before she had shut the door, and was 
so absorbed in looking at it that she forgot 
what she had come for, and never said a 
word. 

“ How can I serve you ? ” said the man, 
politely. 

“Oh, how do you do?” said Gypsy, red- 
dening. 

“ I ’m very well, I thank you,” said the 
jeweller, his singular smile becoming so very singular 
that Gypsy was more confused than ever. 
She felt as if he were making fun of her, and she 
knew that she had said a stupid thing; so, by 
way of making up for it, with her face on fire, 
she broke out: — 

“ I want to sell a heart and some buttons for 
my brother ; that is — I mean — well, do you pay 
people for old jewelry? That ’s what I mean.” 

Well, it depended on the quality; sometimes 
he did and sometimes he did n’t; he would look 
at anything she might have and tell her. So 
out came the heart and the buttons, the ring 
and the lava stud, a second time. The jeweller 


took them up one by one, examined them care- 
fully, laid them down, and said, looking as if 
he were relieving himself of some excellent 
joke, that he would give her two dollars and a 
half for the whole. 

“Why, I expected to get ten, just as much as 
could be ! “ said Gypsy. 

“ Two dollars and a half is all they ’re worth. 
Miss,” repeated the jeweller, and his remarkable 
smile broadened and grew to such an extent 
that Gypsy’s indignation got the better of her 
politeness. 

“ I should like to know what you ’re laughing 
at, if you please ! I don’t see anything so very 
funny ! ” 

“ Oh, nothing, nothing. I beg your pardon ; 
only to think that you expected ten dollars ! 
but nothing is the matter at all.” 

“ Then you won’t give me any more than two 
dollars and a half! ” said Gypsy, faintly, her 
ripe red lips quivering with disappointment. 
“ Two dollars and a half would never pay 
the debt. Poor Tom, poor Tom ! ” 



Just then a customer opened the door; a step 
strangely familiar sounded on the floor behind 
her ; a heavy hand was laid upon her shoulder. 
Gypsy started, turned, and screamed. 

It was her father. 


hot crimson blood rushed all over her 
face, down her neck, out to the tips of her 
fingers. If he had caught her stealing, she could 
not have looked more guilty. In a minute she 
remembered herself, and tried to laugh as if 
nothing unusual were going on. 

“ Why, father ! Where on earth did you 
drop down from?” 

“ I am just on my way home from Burling- 
ton, and had a little business here. I did not 
expect to find you. What brought you over? 
and what are you buying there?” 



“ I came over to get mother some worsteds ; 
that is — yes, I ’ve been buying her some 
worsteds for her camp-chair.” 

“ But these are not worsteds.” 

Gypsy looked the other way and stood still, 
and the jeweller seemed to think that it was 
very funny. 

“What were you doing, Gypsy? buying 
some jewelry? Does your mother know about 
it? ” 

Gypsy picked up the trinkets and never said 
a word. What should she say? Her father 
began to look displeased. 

“Gypsy,” said he, gravely, “what does all 
this mean?” 

Gypsy, bewildered, frightened, hardly know- 
ing what she said, broke out: — 

“ No, sir, I wasn’t buying, I was selling, — 
just some little things that belong to me, and 
mother always lets me do what I want with my 
things, and the man wouldn’t give me but two 
dollars and a half, and that won’t half pay 
it, and — I mean, I don’t want Tom to go 



to prison, and — oh, dear, let ’s go home 
now.” 

“ Put those things back into your purse,” 
said her father, sternly. Gypsy obeyed in 
silence, and in silence they went out of the 
store and left the jeweller smiling still. 

Mr. Breynton took the road to the depot, 
walking in great strides that Gypsy could 
scarcely keep up with. For a few moments he 
said nothing to her, and his silence frightened 
her more than anything he could have said. 

“Gypsy!” he began at last — and Gypsy 
trembled all over — “ Gypsy, I don’t understand 
this thing, and I want you to explain it, the 
whole of it.” 

Gypsy knew that she must obey, and it 
seemed to her as if her breath stopped coming. 
What would Tom say? Oh, what would he? 
She spoke her thought for answer, and it was 
the best answer that she could have made : — 

“ Oh, father, I don’t know what Tom will 
say to me I He wouldn’t have had you know 
for the world, not for the world, and mother 

 


was too sick to tell, and so I had to do it all 
alone, and — ” 

“ Do what all alone?” interrupted her father, 
severely; “what is this about Tom? What 
has he done?” 

“He borrowed a little money, — I don’t be- 
lieve it was very much, but he borrowed it,” 
said Gypsy, faintly, “ and he couldn’t pay, and 
I was afraid he would have to go to prison, and 
so I thought I ’d sell my heart and things, — it 
was a real old heart, and jammed up where 
Winnie bit it and I stamped on it when we were 
little, you know,” she added, her eyes twinkling 
in spite of her fright and grief. 

“ So Tom has run in debt, and been to you 
to pay it ! ” 

Mr. Breynton’s eyes flashed, and there was a 
terrible sound in his voice. Gypsy did not 
dare to say a word. 

“ I should like to know how long this has 
been going on ! ” 

“ Oh, not long, sir, not very long, and Tom 
was so sorry, and I know he didn’t mean to. 



and I neverr cared a bit for the heart, you know, 
and the ring was all black lying out in that 
funny little chink under the fence.” 

There was a silence. Mr. Breynton strode 
rapidly on, and Gypsy had to run to keep up 
with him. 

“ I should like to know,” he said suddenly, 
“what you meant by saying that Tom wouldn’t 
have me know for the world, but would have 
told his mother if she had been fit to hear such 
a disgraceful story.” 

“Why, you know, Tom thinks you — you 
don’t take things just like mother,” said honest 
Gypsy, afraid that she was going to be disrespectful, 
but not knowing any other way than 
to tell the truth. “ Sometimes you are very 
much displeased, you know, and you talk to 
him a good deal and he gets angry, — and of 
course that’s very wrong in him; but then he 
seems to get along better with mother; and 
he said he knew he had no business to have 
borrowed, but he didn’t dare to have you 
know, and you see, sir, I wasn’t to say a 


word about it, and I don’t know what he 
will do.” 

Mr. Breynton made no answer, but strode on 
faster than ever, his face flushing and paling 
and working strangely. Gypsy wondered what 
he was thinking; whatever it was, she never 
knew, nor any one else, perhaps. 

” I do hope you won’t scold him very hard,” 
she ventured at last, in a very faint voice. 
“ He didn’t mean to, oh, I know he didn’t 
mean to.” 

“ Do you think you have been doing right 
to start off in this way without the knowledge 
of either your mother or father, selling jewelry 

in the stores to help him when he doesn’t deserve 
to be helped? That money was really 
stolen from me, as much as it will be stolen 
from his class-mate if it is not paid. He knew 
I hadn’t it for him to spend,” said Mr. Breyn- 
ton, taking no notice of what she said. 

“ I ’m sure I don’t know,” said poor Gypsy. 

I was so troubled and bothered, and I wanted 
to tell mother. I tried to do right, any way ” 


She raised her great brown eyes just then, 
and nobody looking into them could doubt 
it. Her father did not, and he spoke more 
gently. 

“ Well, well, my child, I hope so. Tom 
makes us all a great deal of trouble. I don’t 
understand it. I ’m sure I have taken care 
enough of that boy.” 

Gypsy might have said a thing or two to that, 
if she had not been his daughter ; but she did 
something that was much better. She began to 
plead again — and Gypsy made a very pretty 
pleader — for Tom. 

“You know, father, he will never do it again 

as long as he lives, never, and he is so dread- 



fully sorry and ashamed and all, and if he gets 
angry, and goes and acts worse after it, why, I 
should cry so, father ! ” 

Her father drew her hand up into his, his 
nervous face pale and puzzled and grave. 

“ He has done wrong, Gypsy, and I must tell 
him so. But I will be gentle with him, and I 
will pay the debt this time, though I never shall

I had supposed you ’d be so nice, I should 
have wanted to tell and have it over, right 
straight off.” 

Towards the end of the term, Tom came out 
with a new idea. He wanted to go into the 
army. His letters home were filled with it, 
and the more his father opposed it, the more 
Tom insisted. The boy was too young, said 
Mr. Breynton, and said rightly; it would be 
the ruin of him, body and soul ; the Government
neither required nor needed such sacrifices 
yet; if the war lasted till he was twenty, he 
might go ; not a month before. 

But so many of the fellows were going, rea- 
soned Tom; everybody was talking about it, 
since that last defeat at the West; two of his 
own class-mates had left within a fortnight ; he 
felt so mean to stay at home. Sometimes his 
letters would come embellished with flags and 




shields and various national devices of Ids own 
painting; sometimes he copied for Gypsy cer- 
tain stirring patriotic songs which were popular 
in college, and privately instructed her to sing 
them to her father every night when he came 
home from the store. Once in a while he 
undertook a very particular appeal to his mother, 
but received for answer only a gentle, “ I am
