BOILED CORNED BEEF.

Wash well, and put over the fire in hot water—plenty of it—and boil
twenty minutes for each pound of meat. Turn three times while cooking.
Drain dry, and serve with drawn butter in a boat. “Draw” the butter in
liquor taken from the pot. Keep the rest of the liquor for the base of
Sunday’s soup.


MASHED TURNIPS.

Pare, quarter, and lay in cold water half an hour. Put on in boiling
water, and cook until tender. Drain, mash, and press to get out the
water, work in pepper, salt, and a generous lump of butter. Do all this
quickly not to cool the turnips, and pile smoothly in a hot, deep dish.


CAULIFLOWER, WITH SAUCE.

Pick off the leaves and cut the stem close. Do not cut the cauliflower
unless very large. Lay in cold water for thirty minutes, tie in coarse
bobbinet lace or mosquito net, and cook in boiling water, slightly
salted, until tender. Lay the cauliflower, flower upward, within a hot
dish, and pour the sauce over it.


SAUCE FOR THE ABOVE.

Stir into a cup of boiling water a tablespoonful of flour, wet up with
cold. When it has boiled two minutes, add two tablespoonfuls of butter,
the white of an egg whipped stiff, pepper and salt, and the juice of a
lemon. Boil one minute, and pour over the cauliflower.


BAKED MACARONI.

Break half a pound of macaroni into pieces an inch long, and cook
in boiling water, slightly salted, twenty minutes. Drain, and put a
layer in the bottom of a greased bake-dish, upon this some grated
cheese—Parmesan, if you can get it—and tiny bits of butter. Then more
macaroni, and so on, filling the dish, with grated cheese on top. Wet
with a little milk, and salt lightly. Bake, covered half an hour, then
brown. Serve in the bake-dish.


JELLY TARTLETS.

  1 lb. of flour.
  ½ lb. of butter.
  ¼ lb. of lard.
  Yolk of an egg.
  Ice-water.

Wash the butter in three waters, working it over well to get out the
salt. Melt it in a tin cup set in boiling water, take the scum from the
top, and let it get almost cold, when beat, little by little, into the
whipped egg. Work these into the flour, adding just enough ice-water
to make the paste soft enough to roll out. When you have rolled it
into a thin sheet, spread all over with the lard, put on with a knife.
Sprinkle lightly with flour, roll up, and flatten with three or four
strokes of the rolling-pin. Roll again into a yet thinner sheet; again
lubricate with the lard and sprinkle with flour, and, once more, make
into a tight roll. Set for an hour in a cold place. Cut in two. Set
aside enough for your Monday’s dessert; line small “patty-pans” with
the rest, pricking the paste on the bottom to keep it from puffing too
high. Bake in a quick oven, and when cold put a tablespoonful of sweet
jelly or jam in each.


APPLES AND NUTS,

Especially the former, are better for very young stomachs than pastry.


  Second Week.      Sunday.
  ——
  Mock Turtle Bean Soup.
  Haunch of Venison.      Moulded Potatoes.
  Lima Beans.      Sweet Potatoes, Browned.
  ——
  Wine Jelly with Whipped Cream.
  Coffee and Fancy Cakes.
  ——


MOCK TURTLE BEAN SOUP.

  1 quart of mock turtle soup beans.
  2 onions, chopped.
  4 stalks of celery, cut small.
  Liquor in which the corned beef of yesterday was boiled.
  Pepper.
  Dice of fried bread.
  1 quart of cold water.
  1 tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour.

Soak the beans overnight. In the morning, pour on a quart of cold
water, and set them where they will heat for an hour, without burning.
Stir up often from the bottom. At the end of this time add the beef
liquor (after taking off the fat), the onions, and celery. Cook gently
three hours, until the beans are boiled to pieces. Strain, season, put
back into the kettle, boil up, season with pepper, stir in the butter
rolled in flour. Simmer five minutes, and pour upon the fried bread in
the tureen.

If you cannot get the purple “mock turtle soup beans,” use the common
white ones.


HAUNCH OF VENISON.

Wash all over with lukewarm vinegar and water; then rub well with
butter or lard to soften the skin. Cover the top and sides with
foolscap paper, well greased, and coat it with a paste of flour
and water, half an inch thick. Lay over this a large sheet of thin
wrapping-paper, and over this another of stout foolscap. Tie all down
in place by greased pack-thread. The papers should also be thoroughly
greased.

Thus much on Saturday—and set the venison in a very cold place.
Next day, about three hours before it will be needed, put into the
dripping-pan, with two cups of boiling water in the bottom. Invert
another pan over it to keep in the steam; be sure that the fire is
good, and leave it to itself for an hour. Then see that the paper
is not scorching; wet it all over with hot water and a ladleful of
gravy; cover and let it alone for an hour and a half more. Remove
the papers and paste, and test with a skewer in the thickest part.
If it goes in readily, close the oven, and let it brown for half an
hour. Baste freely four times with claret and butter; at last dredge
with flour and rub over with butter to make a froth. Take it up, put
upon a hot dish. Skim the gravy left in the dripping pan, strain it,
thicken with browned flour; add two teaspoonfuls of currant-jelly, a
glass of claret, pepper and salt. Boil up for an instant, and serve
in a gravy-boat. Allow a quarter of an hour to the pound in roasting
venison. The neck can be roasted in the same way as the haunch.


MASHED POTATOES—MOULDED.

Having mashed and seasoned them as usual, grease well the inside of
a fluted pudding or cake mould, put in the potato, cover, and set for
half an hour in a dripping-pan half full of boiling water, within a
moderate oven. Then remove the lid, dip, for a moment, the mould in
cold water, and turn the potato out upon a flat dish.


LIMA BEANS.

You can get them canned, but they are nearly, if not quite as good
dried. In this case soak them overnight in soft water. Change this in
the morning for fresh, and put them on to boil in hot water, a little
salted. Cook slowly until soft. Do not boil so fast as to break the
skins. Drain well, stir in a good piece of butter, a little pepper and
salt, and eat very hot.


SWEET POTATOES—BROWNED.

Boil in their skins, peel while hot, and set them in a quick oven.
Glaze presently with butter, repeating the process, several times, as
they brown.


WINE JELLY WITH WHIPPED CREAM.

  1 package of Coxe’s gelatine, soaked for two hours in a large cup of
          cold water.
  2 cups of white wine, or pale sherry.
  1 lemon, all the juice and half the grated peel.
  1 teaspoonful of bitter almond extract.
  2 cups of white sugar.
  2 cups of boiling water.

Put soaked gelatine, lemon, sugar, and flavoring extract together, and
cover closely for half an hour. Pour on boiling water, stir and strain.
Add the wine, strain again through a flannel bag, without squeezing,
and leave in a mould wet with cold water, until just before the Sunday
dinner.

Whip a cup of rich cream to a thick froth in a syllabub-churn. The
jelly should have been formed in an open mould—one with cylinder in the
middle. Fill the hollow left by this with the whipped cream; or, if
your jelly be a solid mass, heap the cream about the base.


COFFEE AND MACAROONS

Should be the final course. I make no apology for hot and good Sunday
dinners. There is a vast deal of straining out infinitesimal gnats and
swallowing gigantic camels upon this, as upon most other questions of
conscience. We have neither time nor space for their discussion. I
have simply tried to deal with the fact that most husbands, brothers,
and fathers expect a better dinner on Sabbath, and enjoy it more, than
upon other days, by showing, to the best of my ability, how they can be
gratified without imposing heavy duties upon mistress and servants at a
season when both mind and body need comparative rest.


  Second Week.      Monday.
  ——
  “Second Thoughts” Soup.
  Larded Venison.      Scalloped Tomatoes.
  Grape Jelly.      Fried Sweet Potatoes.
  ——
  Raspberry and Currant Jelly Tart.
  ——


“SECOND THOUGHTS” SOUP.

Heat Saturday’s soup to a boil; add two cups of milk, and when this
heats, pour a little of it upon two beaten eggs. Return these to the
soup, add whatever seasoning is necessary; simmer all together for one
minute, and pour upon three or four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese
placed in the bottom of the tureen. Stir up well, and it is ready.


LARDED VENISON.

Trim the remains of the roast haunch into a neat shape, and lard
with strips of fat pork, making incisions to receive it with a thin,
sharp-edged knife. Pour what gravy you have over it, or should there
be none, use butter and water instead. Put into a dripping-pan, turn
another over it and roast—or steam—for one hour. Meantime, make a
gravy of the trimmings, bits of bone, etc., by covering them well with
cold water, and adding half an onion, sliced. Stew until the gravy
is reduced one-half. Strain, season with pepper; a tablespoonful of
currant-jelly, one of catsup and two of claret. Thicken slightly with
browned flour, boil up to mix well, and pour gradually over the meat.
Baste abundantly with this for half an hour if the piece of meat be
large. Less time may suffice for a small roast. Never let it dry for
an instant. When done, it should seem to have been stewed rather than
roasted. Serve the gravy in a sauce-boat.

Like some other “second thoughts,” this dish will be even better than
at its first appearance.


SCALLOPED TOMATOES.

Turn nearly all the juice off from a can of tomatoes. Salt and pepper
this, by the way, and put aside in a cool place for some other day’s
soup. Put a layer of bread-crumbs in the bottom of a buttered pie-dish;
on them one of tomatoes; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and some bits
of butter, also a little sugar. Another layer of crumbs, another of
tomatoes—seasoned—then a top layer of very fine, dry crumbs. Bake
covered until bubbling hot, and brown quickly.


FRIED SWEET POTATOES.

Slice cold ones left from yesterday, or boiled this fore-noon; roll in
flour and fry in dripping. Drain well.


RASPBERRY AND CURRANT JELLY TART.

Roll out the raw paste reserved for to-day from Saturday, and line two
pie-dishes. Fill them nearly full of canned raspberries, sweetened to
your liking. Spread a coating of currant jelly over the top, and cover
with a lattice-work of pastry, cut with a jagging-iron. Watch your
chance of putting them into the oven, as they are better when not hot.

You will like them, I think.



  Second Week.      Tuesday.
  ——
  Clam Soup.
  Ragoût of Veal.      Rice and Cheese.
  Potato Puff.      Celery Salad.
  ——
  A Mere Trifle.
  ——


CLAM SOUP.

  50 clams, ready opened.
  1 quart of milk.
  1 pint of water.
  3 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  12 whole peppers.
  A few bits of red pepper pods.
  6 blades of mace.
  Salt to taste.
  1 stalk of celery, cut small.
  1 tablespoonful rice-flour or corn-starch.

Drain off the liquor from the clams and put it over the fire in a
large farina-kettle, with a pint of water, the peppers, mace, celery,
and salt. When it has boiled ten minutes, strain and put back into
the kettle with the clams. Shut the lid down closely, and boil, fast,
thirty minutes. Heat the milk in another vessel, stir into it the
rice-flour, wet up with cold water, and the butter. Pour into the
kettle with the clams, take at once from the fire, pour into the
tureen, in the bottom of which you have laid four or five Boston
crackers, split. Cover, and wait five minutes before serving.


RAGOÛT OF VEAL.

  5 lbs. of knuckle of veal.
  1 onion.
  2 stalks of celery.
  Bunch of sweet herbs.
  Juice of tomatoes set aside yesterday.
  Juice of half a lemon.
  1 tablespoonful of butter.
  2 tablespoonfuls of browned flour.
  ¼ lb. of streaked fat pork.
  Pepper and salt.

Crack the bones, when you have taken the meat off, and put them into
a saucepan with the minced onion, celery, and herbs, with a quart
of water. Stew slowly until the liquor has boiled down to a pint.
Meanwhile, cut the veal into neat slices, and fry until they begin to
brown, in some good dripping. Strain the gravy made from the bones and
vegetables over this, and put all on to stew, adding the tomato-juice,
pepper, and pork, the last cut up fine. Simmer, with the lid on, for
two hours. Then add the browned flour, wet up in cold water, salt, if
needed, the butter and lemon-juice. Boil up once, and dish.


RICE AND CHEESE.

Boil a cup of rice in a quart of water, slightly salted, and when
half-done add two tablespoonfuls of butter. By the time the rice is
soft, the water should have been soaked up entirely, and each grain
stand out whole in the mass. Never stir boiling rice, but shake
up the saucepan instead. Stir into the rice, at this point, three
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Toss up with
a fork until the cheese is dissolved, and pour into a deep dish.


POTATO PUFF.

Mash the potatoes while hot. Beat in butter, milk, and two whipped
eggs, with salt to your liking, until you have a light, soft paste.
Bake in a buttered pudding-dish in a quick oven.


CELERY SALAD.

Cut up blanched stalks of celery into short pieces. Mix a dressing of
one tablespoonful of oil to one teaspoonful of sugar, one of salt,
half as much pepper, and four tablespoonfuls of vinegar with half a
teaspoonful of made mustard. Heat the vinegar to scalding, and pour
over a beaten egg, a little at a time, and beating it in well. To this
add the oil and other ingredients, whipping up the mixture with an
egg-beater. When cold, pour over the salad, toss up with a silver fork,
and put into a glass bowl.


A MERE TRIFLE.

  1 quart of fresh milk.
  5 eggs.
  6 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
  Vanilla, or other essence, 2 teaspoonfuls.

Heat the milk to boiling, and pour, gradually, upon the beaten yolks
and sugar. Put again over the fire, stir steadily for about ten
minutes, or until it begins to thicken. Take it off, and while still
very hot, stir in with a few light strokes half of the frothed whites.
Let it get cold before flavoring it. Pour into a glass bowl. Whip the
remaining whites to a méringue with a little powdered sugar. Heap
upon the custard. Put bits of bright jelly, or preserved strawberries,
here and there upon the snowy mass.



  Second Week.      Wednesday.
  ——
  Hotch-Potch.
  Stewed Pigeons.      Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.
  Kidney Beans.      Mixed Pickles.
  ——
  English Tapioca Pudding.
  ——


HOTCH-POTCH.

  2 lbs. of lean beef, without bones, and cut into mince-meat.
  2 onions.
  2 carrots.
  2 turnips.
  2 stalks of celery.
  ½ small cabbage, cut fine.
  2 potatoes.
  1 cup of corn.
  Half a can of tomatoes.
  Bunch of sweet herbs, chopped.
  Pepper and salt.
  2 tablespoonfuls of butter.

Wash, scrape, and slice the vegetables, and put all except the tomatoes
into a pot; cover with hot water and boil gently ten minutes. Drain off
the water, put a handful of the mixed vegetables, including now the
tomatoes, in the bottom of a stone jar. Pepper and salt, strew thickly
with the minced raw beef, repeat the order until your materials are all
in the jar. Fit a top or a small plate over the mouth; tie down with
stout greased paper, set it within the oven, and let it alone for five
or six hours, except that you must look, now and then, to see that the
paper does not take fire. Prevent this by greasing it abundantly. At
the end of this time, turn out the hotch-potch; stir in the butter,
and, if needed, additional seasoning through it, and serve in a tureen.


STEWED PIGEONS.

Pick, clean, and wash the pigeons, and put into a pot with a cupful of
water to keep them from burning, and a tablespoonful of butter for each
one. Shut the lid down tightly, and subject to a slow heat until they
are of a nice brown—about nut-color. Once in a great while turn them,
and see that each is well wet with the liquor. Take them out and cover
in a warm place—a colander set over a pot of hot water is best—while
you make the gravy. Chop the giblets of the pigeon “exceeding small”
with a little onion and parsley. Put into the gravy, pepper and salt,
boil up and thicken with browned flour. Return the pigeons to the pot,
cover again tightly, and cook slowly until tender. If there should not
be liquor enough in the pot to make the gravy, add boiling water before
the giblets go in.

This is an admirable receipt.


POTATOES À LA LYONNAISE.

Cut parboiled potatoes into dice. Chop an onion and fry it, with a
little minced parsley, in good dripping or butter, for one minute. Then
put in the potatoes. Stir briskly until they have fried slowly for
five minutes. They must never stick to the bottom, nor brown. Sprinkle
with pepper and salt, drain free of fat by shaking them in a heated
colander, and send up hot.


KIDNEY BEANS.

Soak over night in soft water; next morning cover with lukewarm, and
cook slowly for one hour. Salt slightly and boil until tender, but
not to actual breaking. Drain very well, stir in a liberal spoonful of
butter, pepper, and serve.


ENGLISH TAPIOCA PUDDING.

  1 cup of tapioca.
  5 eggs.
  3 pints of milk.
  1 cup of sugar.
  2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  ½ lb. of raisins.
  Half the grated peel of a lemon.
  A little salt.

Soak the tapioca for one hour in a pint of the milk; pour into a
farina-kettle, surround with warm water, salt very slightly, and bring
to a boil. When soft throughout, turn out to cool, while you make the
custard. Heat a quart of milk to scalding; pour over the beaten eggs
and sugar, this last having been rubbed to a cream with the butter. Mix
with the tapioca—lemon-peel and raisins last. Dredge the fruit lightly
with flour, and beat all up hard. Bake in a buttered dish one hour—at
first covered.

Eat warm, with powdered sugar. It is better for not being too hot.



  Second Week.      Thursday.
  ——
  Celery Soup.
  Mutton Cutlets—Fried.      Stewed Corn and Tomatoes.
  Brussels Sprouts.      Mashed Potatoes.
  ——
  Apple Méringue Pie.
  ——


CELERY SOUP.

  2 lbs. of veal.
  1 slice of corned ham, or a ham-bone.
  2 bunches of celery.
  2 cups of milk.
  2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up in water.
  2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  1 teaspoonful of sugar.
  1 onion.
  Dice of fried bread.
  Pepper and salt.
  3 quarts of water.

Chop the meat, onion, and herbs; cover with the water and put on to
stew early in the day. When the meat has boiled to rags and the liquid
reduced one-half, strain, and put in the celery, cut into small pieces.
Use the best parts only. Stew soft; rub through a colander and return
with the broth to the saucepan. Season, add the sugar, boil up and
skim, and put in the milk. Heat, and add corn starch. When it again
boils, you stirring all the while, put in the butter.

Take off so soon as this has melted, and pour over the fried bread in
the tureen.


MUTTON CUTLETS—FRIED.

Beat them flat with the broad side of a hatchet; season with pepper and
salt, dip first in beaten egg, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in lard or
dripping. Drain perfectly free from the fat, and arrange them, standing
on end and touching one another, around a mound of mashed potatoes.


MASHED POTATOES.

Prepare as usual, and shape with a knife into a smooth mound, with a
hedge of cutlets about the base.


STEWED CORN AND TOMATOES.

Take a half-can of tomatoes and the same of corn, the rest of that
which was opened for your “hotch-potch” yesterday, and, after mixing
them up well, season with pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Set on
where they will cook slowly. At the end of twenty-five minutes, stir in
a great spoonful of butter. Put on the lid and stew very gently ten
minutes more. Serve in a deep dish.


BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

Pick over, trim, and lay in cold water for half an hour cook quickly in
boiling water, a little salt, for fifteen minutes. Drain carefully, put
upon a flat dish, and pour drawn butter over them.


APPLE MÉRINGUE PIE.

  1 quart of flour.
  ½ lb. of butter.
  ¼ lb. of lard.
  Ice-water.

Chop the lard in flour, wet up with ice-water to a stiff paste. Roll
thin, and baste with one-third of the butter, sprinkle lightly with
flour, and roll up. Again roll out, even thinner than before, baste
again with half the remaining butter, sprinkle with flour, and make a
second roll. Repeat this process yet a third time, and set in a cold
place for one hour.

Cut the roll of paste into two pieces, reserving one for to-morrow’s
oyster-pie. With the other, line two pie-dishes and fill with good
apple-sauce, well sweetened, and seasoned with nutmeg. Bake until
just done. Draw to the oven door, and spread with a méringue made by
whipping stiff the whites of three eggs for each pie, sweetening with
a tablespoonful of sugar for each egg. Flavor with a little rose-water
or lemon-essence, beat until you can make a clean cut in it, and spread
three-quarters of an inch thick upon each pie. Shut the oven door until
the méringue is well set. Do not let it scorch. Eat cold.


  Second Week.      Friday.
  ——
  Friars’ Soup.
  Oyster Pie.      Calf’s Liver à l’Anglaise.
  Apple Sauce.      Stewed Parsnips.
  Potatoes au gratin.      Picklette.
  ——
  Chocolate Custard.
  ——


FRIARS’ SOUP.

  4 onions.
  3 stalks of celery.
  ¼ of a small cabbage.
  2 turnips.
  4 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  ½ cup raw rice.
  2 eggs.
  Pepper and salt to taste.
  1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley.
  3 quarts of water.

Boil the vegetables, all chopped fine (reserving the parsley for
seasoning), in three quarts of water until they can be pulped through a
colander. Return them, with the water in which they were cooked, to the
fire. Boil the rice, meantime, in a little water until it swells and
absorbs it all. Stir into the vegetable porridge, season, and simmer
for fifteen minutes. Add the butter, simmer ten minutes, dip out a
cupful and beat into the eggs. Stir this into the broth, and before it
begins to boil, take from the fire and pour out, lest the eggs should
curdle.


OYSTER PIE.

Roll out the raw paste made yesterday into a pretty thick sheet. Fill
a pudding-dish with crusts of stale bread, or light crackers. Butter
the edges of the dish that the crust may be easily removed. Cover the
mockpie with the pastry; lay a strip cut in scallops or points, around
the edge, to keep it in place, and bake.

To each pint of oyster-liquor allow a cup of milk, but heat them in
separate vessels. So soon as the liquor boils, put in the oysters and
cook five minutes more. Stir a tablespoonful of corn-starch into the
pint of hot milk, having, of course, first wet it up with cold water,
and, when it thickens, pour over the oysters and liquor. Season with
pepper and salt, and add two tablespoonfuls of butter, if there be a
quart of oysters. Lift the hot crust from the pudding-dish with great
care. Remove the stale bread, wipe out the inside; pour in the stewed
oysters with enough of the soup to cover them well; replace the pastry
and set in the oven for two or three minutes.


CALF’S LIVER À L’ANGLAISE.

  2 lbs. of fresh liver.
  ½ lb. fat salt pork.
  1 tablespoonful of butter.
  ½ of a small onion.
  1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.
  Pepper.
  The pork should salt it sufficiently.

Put the butter into a warm—not hot saucepan. Cut the liver into slices
half an inch thick, and lay upon the butter. Mince the pork and cover
the liver. Sprinkle the parsley and onion, with pepper, on top. Cover
the saucepan closely and set in a kettle of hot water. Keep this water
below the boiling-point for an hour. Then let it boil another hour. The
liver should by this time be very tender and juicy, if the heat has
been properly managed. Take it out, and put it upon a chafing-dish to
keep warm. Boil up, and thicken the gravy with browned flour; pour over
the liver and serve. The inner saucepan should be made of tin.


POTATOES AU GRATIN.

Mash your potatoes soft with butter and milk; mould in a round pan
or tin jelly-mould, made very wet with cold water. Turn out upon a
flat plate—a sheet of tin is better—well-greased, strew with fine, dry
bread-crumbs; set upon the upper grating of the oven to brown quickly.
Slip dexterously from the plate to a hot dish.


STEWED PARSNIPS.

Boil tender and cut in long slices. Heat in a saucepan a cup of milk,
thicken it with a tablespoonful of butter cut into bits and rolled
in flour, season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Put in the
parsnips, boil up once gently, take from the fire, and leave covered in
the saucepan for five minutes before you serve.


PICKLETTE AND APPLE SAUCE.

Pass the first with the oyster pie, which is a course of itself; the
apple sauce with the meat.


CHOCOLATE CUSTARD.

  1 quart of milk.
  5 eggs.
  1 cup of sugar.
  4 heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate.
  2 teaspoonfuls vanilla extract.

Scald the milk, rub the chocolate to a smooth paste in a little cold
milk. Stir into the milk and cook two minutes in it. Beat up the yolks
of the five eggs with the whites of two, and the sugar. Pour the hot
mixture, gradually, upon them, stirring deeply. Turn into a buttered
pudding-dish, and set in a dripping-pan of boiling water. Bake until
firm. When “set” in the middle, spread quickly, without taking from the
oven, with a méringue made by whipping the reserved whites stiff with
a very little sugar. Bake until this is done. Eat cold.


  Second Week.      Saturday.
  ——
  Macaroni Soup.
  Baked Ham.      Cheese Fondu.
  Stewed Potatoes.      Spinach with Eggs.
  ——
  Seymour Pudding.
  ——


MACARONI SOUP.

  3 lbs. knuckle of veal.
  2 lbs. of lean beef.
  1 lb. lean ham.
  2 onions.
  1 carrot.
  2 turnips.
  Bunch of sweet herbs.
  ¼ lb. of macaroni cut into fancy shapes, usually known as “Italian
          Paste.”
  6 cloves.
  3 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  6 quarts of water.
  3 stalks of celery.

Mince the meat, crack the bones, and slice the vegetables. Mix all
together. Put the butter in the bottom of a soup-pot, next the meat,
then the vegetables and herbs; fit on a tight lid, and set the pot
where it will warm very slowly. At the end of an hour, open it, pour
off the gravy; increase the heat until the meat begins to brown on the
sides of the pot. Return the gravy to the rest of the ingredients;
cover with six quarts of cold water, and boil until the liquor has
fallen to four quarts. This should be in four hours. Strain the soup;
pressing out all the nourishment, and rubbing the vegetables through
the sieve. Add the paste, or, if you cannot obtain it, the same
quantity of pipe macaroni, boiled a few minutes in hot water, and left
to get cool. Then, with a sharp knife or scissors, clip it into very
short bits, and put into the soup. Season, boil up, skim well, and let
all cook gently together for ten minutes. Half of the above quantity of
stock will be enough for Saturday’s dinner. Therefore, before adding
the macaroni, take out about two quarts, season well, and set aside for
Sunday’s soup.


BAKED HAM.

Soak overnight in warm water. In the morning, scrub it hard; trim away
the rusty part of the under side and edges; wipe dry; cover the bottom
with a stiff paste of flour and water, and lay, upside down, in the
dripping-pan, with enough water to keep it from burning. Allow, in
baking, twenty-five minutes to the pound. Baste a few times, to prevent
the skin from cracking, and keep hot water in the pan. When a skewer
will pierce the thickest part, take it up, plunge for one minute into
cold water; skin carefully, brush all over with beaten egg, then strew
very thickly with cracker-crumbs, and set in a hot oven to brown. Eat
hot or cold, garnished with sprigs of celery or parsley.


CHEESE FONDU.

  1 pint of boiling milk.
  1 cup very dry bread-crumbs. (Crush the crusts baked in yesterday’s
          oyster pie.)
  ½ lb. dry cheese, grated.
  3 eggs.
  Pepper and salt.

Soak the crumbs in the hot milk; beat in the cheese; then the yolks of
the eggs, pepper and salt. Have a buttered pudding-dish ready, and just
before the fondu goes into the oven whip in the whites of the eggs,
already frothed. Pour into the dish, bake in a brisk oven, and send at
once to table, as it soon falls. This is a delightful accompaniment to
ham.


SPINACH WITH EGGS.

Pick the leaves from the stems, wash well, and boil in hot water,
a little salted, for twenty minutes. Chop and drain. Return to the
saucepan with a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, a
little pepper and salt. Have ready the yolks of three eggs, rubbed to
powder, then wet up with a little cream or milk. Stir all together in
the saucepan, beating with a wire spoon, until they are smooth and
thick. Turn into a deep dish and garnish with the whites of the eggs
cut into rings.


STEWED POTATOES.

Pare the potatoes; cut into quarters, and these into long, even strips.
Lay in cold water half an hour, and cook in boiling water until tender,
with half a minced onion. Drain off nearly all the water; pepper and
salt, and add a cup of cold milk with a tablespoonful of butter rolled
in flour. When it thickens, stir in a little chopped parsley. Simmer
five minutes and serve. The potatoes should not be allowed to break so
much as to lose their shape.


SEYMOUR PUDDING.

  ½ cup of molasses.
  1 scant cup of milk.
  ½ cup of raisins, seeded and cut in half.
  ½ cup of currants.
  ½ cup of suet, powdered.
  ½ teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water.
  1 egg.
  1 teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.
  A little salt.
  1½ cups of Graham flour.

Stir molasses, suet, and milk together, add the egg, spice, flour,
fruit, well dredged with flour—at last, the soda. Beat hard five
minutes before putting it into a buttered pudding-mould. Boil two hours
and a half. Eat with butter and sugar.

BEEF AND BARLEY SOUP.

Use the two quarts of stock set aside yesterday. Soak five or six
tablespoonfuls of barley in cold water two hours. Boil half an hour or
until tender, in a little salted water. When you have taken the cake
of cold fat from the top of the soup, put in the barley and simmer
all together half an hour. Then stir in two tablespoonfuls of shred
gelatine previously soaked one hour in cold water. When this has
dissolved, the soup is ready for use.


STEAMED TURKEY.

Prepare the turkey as for roasting, and, if you have no steamer, put a
gridiron upon the top of a pot of boiling water; lay the fowl upon it,
invert a deep pan, as nearly as possible the size of the mouth of the
pot, over it, stuff wet cloths into whatever space may be left between
the pot and the pan, and keep the water at a hard boil, allowing twenty
minutes for each pound of turkey. Two or three times, replenish the
water by pulling away one of the cloths so as to leave an aperture
large enough to admit the nose of the boiling tea-kettle. When the
turkey is half done, lift the pan and turn it; replace the cloths and
steam again. When it is done, lay upon a hot dish and baste with a
mixture of melted butter and chopped parsley, anointing all parts of
it well. Serve drawn butter in a boat, with a couple of boiled eggs
chopped fine, stirred up in it. Save the giblets of the turkey for
Monday’s soup.


CRANBERRY SAUCE

In a mould, as strained jelly, or the plainer dish of stewed
cranberries, well-sweetened, must accompany this dish.


NAPLES RICE PUDDING.

Take a few tablespoonfuls of the meat boiled in yesterday’s soup,
mince fine, add half a chopped onion, a tablespoonful of dripping
from the top of the soup, and put on to warm with a very little hot
water. Simmer, but do not boil, fifteen minutes. Boil one cup of rice
in enough water, slightly salt, to cover it well. Shake up from time
to time, but do not stir. When the rice is soft and has soaked up the
water, add a cup of cold milk in which has been stirred a tablespoonful
of corn-starch, one raw egg, and a tablespoonful of butter. Take from
the fire before you do this and turn into a bowl. Stir in now the
minced meat and gravy (there should be very little of the latter),
season to taste, mix all up well, and put into a buttered cake-mould.
Set this in a dripping-pan of hot water and bake one hour, closely
covered. Turn out upon a hot dish. It is a very good entrée, and
easily made.


BOILED SWEET POTATOES.

Boil in their skins until soft to the touch; pare quickly, lay upon a
flat dish, butter each, and serve hot.


PUMPKIN PIE.

  1 quart of stewed pumpkin, rubbed through a fine colander.
  6 eggs.
  2 quarts of milk.
  1 teaspoonful of mace.
  1 teaspoonful of cinnamon and the same of nutmeg.
  1½ cups of sugar.

Beat the eggs light and whip in the sugar, then the pumpkin and spice.
At last, mix in the milk, stirring up well from the bottom.

Bake in open shells of paste made according to the receipt given last
Thursday. Eat cold, and send around a plate of cheese with it.
