shall write him a note of thanks.” 




He had been sitting in his library all the 
afternoon, reading a little, thinking a good 
deal, and half envying Martin with the merry 
group and the chatter. Yes, years ago he 
should have begun to fill the place with chil- 
dren. They would be growing up now. One 
tall, fine girl the eldest, who would be a charm- 
ing companion. They would drive and ride 
about the country’s ways, they would sit here 
in the library and read to each other, talk over 
poets and plays, compare the book heroes they 
liked best. By her choice he would have an 
insight into a cultivated, well-trained, broad- 
minded girl’s heart. They would travel and 
he would find new delights, looking through 
the fresh, sweet eyes of youth. 

Oh, yes, he had missed a good deal by an 
unlucky turn of fate. It was too late to begin 
now. 

The ideally perfect autumn came to a sud- 
den end. Sunday was cloudy and cold, a gray 
day with a sort of sullen wind that seemed to 
be looking for all the weak places in the sum- 
mer’s worn armor. Helen went to church. 
How people grumbled, as if it was hardly a 



fair thing after the serene weather. The 

roasted chicken and the sweet potatoes went to 
Helen’s heart. Mrs. Stirling had a cheerful 
wood fire kindled in the sitting-room, and the 
pine cones and hemlock branches gave out a 
penetrating fragrance. 

She read a while afterward, then she wrote 
some letters. It seemed to bring the friends 
so near. Shirley was still enthusiastically 
happy, and Mrs. Bell’s content was so sweet a 
thing it brought tender tears to Helen’s eyes. 
And Juliet was so happy and busy. The girls 
wrote every week, but they thought the 
happiest time of all would be when they had 
graduated and come home for good. “ And 
I think of the pleasure we shall have. I hope 
their father, in some mysterious manner, can 
see their joy. It gladdens my life so much,” 
Juliet wrote, and Helen knew how sweet a 
smile irradiated her face. Baby was the 
sweetest and most affectionate little thing. “ I 
don’t see how she can be so sweet and good, a 
weed growing in the slums, but there might 
have been some virtues back of her. I thank 
God every day that he placed me where I 


 

could save her, and I pity the poor woman 
whose husband had not enough faith in God 
to allow her to rescue ‘ one of these little 
ones!  What if I had had a husband who 
objected ! ” 

Helen smiled a little over that. 

Then there was Mrs. Yarrow’s enthusiasm, 
and the professor’s joy. “ It is the loveliest 
and grandest thing of all my life. I thought I 
had made him happy before, but this exquisite 
satisfaction is quite indescribable. I think he 
looks on all girls with tenderer eyes, but I hope 
he will not be too indulgent. You can’t think 
how much we want you to come to see our 
happy household.” 

How alike the real and the assumed mother- 
hood was ! Only in Juliet’s life there was no 
third person to share the blessing. 

The storm came on fiercely now and the 
wind blew in long sweeps and with a roar, like 
. some unhappy monster striving to escape. 
Mrs. Stirling always took a nap on Sunday 
afternoon; she never called it a siesta. It 
grew darker. Helen put up her portfolio and 
drew a rocking-chair nearer the fire just for 




sociability. Lilian sat on the other side. It 
seemed as if she looked rather despondent. 

Helen wondered a little if she had been quite 
as friendly as was her duty. They had not 
assimilated in any great degree. Helen’s 
training had made her sufficient for herself and 
she hardly realized the paucity of this girl’s 
resources, although it seemed as if she must 
have gained considerable experience. 

Lilian Firth was disappointed in her new 
life. The town where she had lived was small 
enough for everybody to know each other. 
There were no really rich people to hold aloof. 
Young people had flocked together. There 
were church sociables, a singing school, picnics 
in the summer and skating in the winter, be- 
side small parties at each other’s houses with 
old time games and much merriment, if of a 
rather crude sort. And the girl who <£ kept 
company ” was really envied among her com- 
peers. 

James Firth had not cordially approved of 
the young fellow who worked out on a farm, 
as did most of the young men who did not 
have farms of their own or who did not go 


 

away. James said he had no “ push ” to him. 
Lilian’s money was good enough where it was; 
he was paying her interest for it now. But 
she was thinking and planning for a home of 
her own, and many things seemed possible to 
her inexperience. She meant to be married 
when vacation came. 

Of course it was a great blow to her. Then 
the certainty that she would not have the school 
another year, though in her first disappoint- 
ment she was ready to fly to the ends of the 
earth. A jilted girl, and to see her rival’s 
happiness every Sunday at least! It was her 
brother’s fault. If their marriage had been 
planned and the time set, this could not have 
happened. 

So at first she was glad to accept her aunt’s 
offer. She had no thought but that she should 
step at once right among other girls and have 
so good a time that she would soon forget. 
But her aunt’s visitors were mostly middle- 
aged. She had gone in the Bible class, but the 
girls seemed of such a different order that she 
did not feel at home. And at school the big 
girls were too young for her; if she could have 




taught the smaller ones, she would have been 
happier. 

Here was Miss Grant, bright, vigorous, 
good-looking, a ready talker, and yet in these 
six weeks not a young man had called on her. 
A few married people had been in, Mr. Hil- 
dreth had spent one evening. Didn’t she mean 
to have some admirers ? 

‘ What is it, Lilian? I wonder if you are 
homesick ? ” 

The tone was sweet, sympathetic, but the 
listener’s lip drooped a little. 

“ This is better than at my brother’s in some 

things. If I could have kept the school ” 

“ I wish you were real interested in study. 
What do you like the most ? ” 

“ I don’t know. It seems as if a good deal 
of it wouldn’t be of much use.” 

“ You will make a good mathematician.” 

“ I don’t see any good in trigonometry, 
and logic. Then the history of those dead 
and gone people that we don’t care anything 
about. Of course we want to know about our 
own country.” 

“ And many people want to know about the 


 

others. Think of China, thousands of years 
old, and the great Tamerlane who swept across 
Asia and meant to conquer it all! No one 
really knows when its curious civilization be- 
gan. And its great philosopher Confucius, 
who iterated a part of the Golden Rule. And 
Egypt's culture and advance long before 
Abraham’s time. Why, I think it very faci- 
nating to go back to the beginning of things if 
we can find them.” 

Helen paused suddenly. There was a time 
when she rebelled against them she remem- 
berd. But if they had been made interesting! 

“ Those old people have been dead and gone 
these many hundred years,” in a tone of dis- 
content. “ I like my own life better, but I 
don't know how to make it suit me. I wish I 
did.” 

Helen wished that she had wisdom enough 
to inspire such girls as these. Teachers must 
get discouraged with the slow progress, and 
just keep to their plain duty like Miss Parker. 
So many of the college teachers were enthu- 
siasts. 

The log broke in two and scattered a shower 




of beautiful sparks. Lilian brought the ends 
together and put on another. That darkened 
the room. How the wind racketed outside and 
occasionally flung itself against the house as 
if it meant to demolish it. But the builder's 
art was stronger than nature in this case. 
How secure one felt! This was among the 
things men had learned, to conquer nature. 
There were ships on the great ocean that were 
“ carried up to heaven and down again to the 
great deep,” yet they came safely through the 
storm. 

“ Miss Grant,” said the rather perturbed 

voice, “ don’t you ever mean to marry? ” 



Helen could have laughed at the incongruous 
change of thought demanded by the question. 

“ I don’t know what I mean to do in that 
respect. There are so many things I want to 
do first.” 

“ But do you not think women are better off, 
happier? ” 

So this was what the poor girl’s mind was 
running on. She recalled an incident at col- 
lege, a girl whose lover had proved recreant 
and who went down to the depths of despair, 


 

and for a while was the dread and vexation of 
teachers. Lilian did not unload her dis- 
appointment on any one, but it was sapping 
away her mental strength nevertheless. What 
could be done for the girl? Was the high 
school the best place for her? Was teaching 
in a half-hearted manner a real benefit to the 
pupil, a fair thing all around ? 

“ You see teachers do not marry as a general 
thing. That Miss Jaynes is very nice but she 
hasn’t any company. And Miss Parker is 
old ” 

“ No, I think we ought not call a woman of 
that age old. If she should live to be seventy 
she would only be in the middle part of her 
life. And since youth is so attractive we ought 
to stay there as long as possible and be willing 
to have our neighbors linger in the enchanted 
land.” 

“ But you can’t stay young. The years will 
go on,” in a despairing sort of tone. 

“ One of the youngest old people I have seen 
is Miss Hetty Gould. She is rosy and bright 
and cheerful, and when she came in to visit the 
school a few days ago I was surprised at her 






intelligence. Their father, it seems , taught 
them all Latin, an unusual thing in those days. 
I do believe now she could construe equal to 
any boy we have. She is going over the 
Odes and Satires of Horace now, and she 
knows a good deal about the other Latin poets. 
Then, only a few years ago, that Mr. Wheeler, 
whose sons keep the clock and jewelry store, 
asked her to marry him, and he was seven 
years younger.” 

“ And she didn’t take him ! ” in surprise. 

“ No.” Helen laughed softly. “ Mrs. Un- 
derwood told me, and she said he took it very 
hard.” 

“ But — why?” For it seemed to Lilian a 
woman must want to marry. 

“ She had a nice home. And she said ‘ she 
could not think of breaking up the trio, they 
were so happy and comfortable together.’ A 
year or two after he married a widow and did 
not make a wise choice, it seems. But I do be- 
lieve in love and marriage when it is suitable.” 

Mrs. Stirling came down just then and they 
could hear Jane preparing supper. 

“ What a terrible storm it is! I am afraid 


 

it will cause no end of destruction. And cold, 
too! Let us give thanks that we are housed 
and warm,” she exclaimed. 

Helen echoed that heartily. 

After supper she read aloud from “ In Me- 
moriam,” and thought of Daisy Bell and also 
Elizabeth Carr, whom she had soothed with 
the tender melody. 

“ Were they really friends?” asked Lilian, 
deeply moved. 

“ Very, very dear friends,” answered Helen 
softly. 

“ I didn’t know men could love each other 
so well, or that poetry was so truly beautiful. 
I’ve never cared much about it.” 

“ We are going to take up some of the poets 
as a study. And you ought to learn to read 
them well, you have a good voice.” 

It still rained the next morning. Martin 
came over. Mr. Hildreth wanted to know if 
he, Martin, could not take the ferns down for 
Miss Grant. 

“ Why, that would be most kind of you. 
Yes, whenever you are at liberty. Thank you 
very much.” 


OCTOBER AND HALLOWE'EN iyi 

There was a pretty fair attendance in spite 
of the rain. At recess, as they could not go 
out, they gathered about Miss Grant, and the 
girls who had taken the ride talked it over in 
an eager fashion. 

“ Suppose you write it for an exercise this 
afternoon,” she said. “ One girl can describe 
the ride there and back, another the river with 
the almost island, then gathering the ferns. 
At noon we will set them out and that will 
make another. Miss Jaynes must think up 
the last.” 

“ One girl ought to write a letter of thanks 
to Mr. Hildreth,” she replied. 

“ That is excellent,” declared Helen. 

They ate their lunch at noon and then 
proceeded to place the ferns in their new 
home. 

“ Oh, who has some scissors ? ” cried Edna 
March. “ See this long — is it a root ? I 
can’t break it. And look what is growing on 
the end ! ” 

Helen turned. “ Oh, don’t cut it ! Why, 
that is quite a prize. This little sort of sprout 
on the end is a new fern, a baby, though it has 




gone a long way from its mother. It is called 
a traveling fern. It sends out this wiry sort 
of shoot that presently touches the ground and 
takes root and a new fern grows.” 

“ Can we make it grow here ? ” 

“ I think so. We will try.” 

“ And here is an old root,” — doubtfully, 
holding it up in her hand. 

“We are going to bury that and see if the 
warmth will not make it think it is spring, 
and it may poke up its gray, fuzzy head. 
Perhaps we can't deceive it, though,” and she 
laughed. 

“ Well, we will try. Oh, won’t it be 
funny ! ” 

“ Florists are doing this all the time. They 
make lilies of the valley blossom at Christmas, 
and many other summer flowers.” 

They had more than enough to fill their box, 
and Mr. Underwood sent them a large flat pot 
that had come last year with some Easter 
tulips. 

The compositions on their outing were so 
well done that Miss Grant sent them in to Mr. 
Underwood, who commended them warmly. 



And Mr. Hildreth came in to see the fern bed 
and express his pleasure that they had enjoyed 
it so much. 

The next grand adventure was chestnutting. 
Most of the school turned out for that, except 
some of the older girls who did not want to be 
in such a rabble. Mr. Underwood went to 
thrash the trees, he said, since he was not al- 
lowed to thrash any boys. 

They had a grand time and a great deal of 
fun. Early autumn, and warm weather was 
over. The gardens were despoiled of all 
blooms except the chrysanthemums. The 
trees were well-nigh leafless, only here and 
there an oak or a copper beech stood out de- 
fiantly. How beautiful the slim white birches 
looked ! There were still a few field asters 
and here and there a belated daisy. Great 
clumps of golden-rod were growing fuzzy. 

They gathered a good supply of chestnuts. 
There had been no tramps to despoil the 
woods. They sang songs and then ran races, 
the boys against the girls. 

“ Did you ever run races when you were 
little?” inquired Allen Millard wistfully, 


 

watching the flying children. He had come 
to be a very warm admirer of Miss Grant. 

“ Oh, yes. And when I was big, too, at col- 
lege. We had a course and there was a 
prize for that and other athletic feats,” and 
Helen laughed at the thought of the old 
times. 

“ Did you ever win a prize ? ” 

Helen flushed. “ The freshmen run against 
the sophomores, then they against the juniors, 
and so on. There is a great time. Yes, I 
won twice.’ 

“Oh, I wish I could have seen you!” and 
he drew a long breath. “ I want to go to col- 
lege, Miss Grant, but I shall never be able to 
do any of those things, and you can’t 
think ” His voice broke. 

“Yes, I can, for I have been in it myself. 
There is so much friendly rivalry, so much 
that stirs the blood and the very soul. I am 
sorry to have you handicapped, but I should 
go all the same.” 

“ I like you so much,” in a low tone. 
“ Won’t you come to tea some night and tell 
us all about it ? ” 




Helen promised. 

There was a great deal of fun in the racing. 
The boys beat, of course, but Helen said the 
girls had no regular training and did not know 
how to manage their strength. It was a very 
good-natured contest. 

“ I’ve been almost made over into a boy,” 
Mr. Underwood declared. “ I don’t know 
when I have enjoyed such a frolic. I wish my 
wife had come, Miss Grant, you rouse one’s 
enthusiasm. And to-day you look just six- 
teen. But you manage admirably. The boys 
have improved in their studies. May be by the 
end of the year we may be not quite dis- 
couraged,” laughingly. 

In certain ways they had improved; recita- 
tions and exercises were better, but there was 
still a sort of covert insolence on the part of 
Eastman and occasionally the others. Helen 
did not notice it. Miss Jaynes said, “ It is such 
a pleasure to teach with you ! Oh, I hope noth- 
ing will take you away for years ! ” 

Helen’s eyes were bright with pleasure. 

“ Oh, Miss Grant ! ” one of the girls said 
Friday afternoon when school had closed, 


 

“ do you know any Hallowe'en tricks ? The 
boys are going to have a procession, and it will 
be queer enough! I have been making some 
cotton doughnuts and some salt caramels. I 
wanted to have a real party but mother said 
they would be too uproarious, and I could have 
it later on.” 

They talked over various charms and Helen 
told of some that were simple, yet amusing. 
Mr. Underwood cautioned the boys about com- 
mitting willful mischief, as that would be 
punished. 

Mrs. Stirling closed her old-fashioned board 
shutters. “ I do not suppose they will come up 
as far as here,” she said, “ but it is well enough 
to be prepared.” 

They heard the horns and the clang of tin 
pans now and then, and for a long while all 
was silent. Then there seemed stealthy steps, 
but they died away. 

After a little while, a light ring at the door- 
bell. Jane was going to bed, and with a 
candlestick in her hand she paused to open the 
door and give the intruder a piece of her mind. 
But her little space was pushed so rudely open 




that the door struck her, and something fell 
heavily to the floor. 

Jane screamed with affright. Mrs. Stirling 
came out in the hall. There lay a figure of 
a boy or man, with blood spattered here and 
there on his clothing. A hand lay by itself, 
frightfully white. 

“ Oh, Jane! are you hurt? What is it? 
What dreadful thing ” 

“ My face has had a pretty bad bang.” She 
kicked the form viciously. “ Why, it’s — 
it’s — ” with another and harder kick — “ a 
log — dressed up. And that’s no real hand. 
Drat them boys! I’d like to horsewhip 
them ! ” 

The girls had come out. It was a log hav- 
ing a false face and a long coat wrapped 
around it, with small patches of red flannel 
pinned here and there to simulate blood. The 
hand was made of cotton cloth and stuffed, 
and a red gash on that. 

“ Let us drag it in,” said Mrs. Stirling. 
“ The police must be notified. Why, Jane, if 
it had struck you it would have knocked you 
down. As it is your cheek begins to swell and 


 

your eye also. Why, if it had been your tem- 
ple it might have killed you! ” 

They shut the door and barred it. Then 
they went back to the kitchen and bathed Jane’s 
face with hot water and witch hazel. 

“ The door came so suddenly against me. I 
had meant to open it just a little crack. It 
was such a sort of lady-like ring I didn’t 
suspect, and I thought it might be some one 
from the Cooks’.” 

Helen drew a long breath. “ It was a cruel 
and dastardly thing, and the perpetrators ought 
to be severely punished.” Was it meant as an 
insult or fright to her? 

“ I only hope we can discover them,” said 
Mrs. Stirling. “ And now let us all go to bed. 
The door will not be opened again to-night.” 

True to her word she sallied out early the 
next morning. An officer came to view the 
figure, which was as much as he could lift. 
He took off the wrappings and the mask and 
rolled them up, and dragged the log out of 
doors with instructions to let it lie there for 
a while. 

Soon after there came a reporter for the 




evening paper, and Mrs. Stirling in her indig- 
nation withheld no particulars. Jane’s face 
was still swollen and her eye inflamed. 

Mr. Hildreth came in presently. 

“If there were a crowd of young people 
having a merry party here, one might under- 
stand the cowardly trick. But a small house- 
hold of women! And such a dangerous thing! 
I shall make every effort to find the perpetra- 
tors, for there were several, no doubt.” 

The Stirling house was quite besieged 
through the day. The gates and signs that 
had been exchanged, the steps and fences 
marked up with red and blue chalk were quite 
thrown into the shade by this piece of mischief 
that might have had a fatal result. The whole 
town was indignant over the account in the 
evening paper. Mr. and Mrs. Underwood 
came up to offer their condolence. 

“ If any of the school boys are concerned in 
this they shall be made to suffer, Miss Grant.” 
In a lower tone just for her ear, “ Do you 
suspect any one ? ” 

Helen colored. “ Will not the coat betray 
the perpetrator?” she asked rather confusedly. 


 

“ The coat — I had not thought of that. All 
the things are at the precinct. I can’t quite un- 
derstand ” He knit his brows and looked 

sharply at Helen. “No one can have a grudge 
against Mrs. Stirling. And her niece is a very 
quiet person. If she were a boy, now! ” 

Helen tried to keep down the rising color 
that she felt flooded her face, and leaned over 
to straighten the table-cover that had been 
pushed away. 

“ It was a dastardly act. I should be sorry 
to be the mother of a boy capable of such a* 
thing.” 

“ I do not suppose he really meant serious 
harm. Boys are so thoughtless.” 

“ What is the good of all our training if we 
cannot make them think of the injury to their 
neighbors ? And the churches, the Sunday 
schools? ” 

How fine and spirited her face looked in its 
indignation! Was it the training that had 
made her strong and clear-eyed, reticent, too? 
Any other person having suffered insolence 
from the speech of Dick Eastman would have 
accused him at a venture. 


CHAPTER VIII 


KEEPING A SECRET 

Mrs. Stirling was quite exhausted on Sun- 
day, from the talk and the excitement, and did 
not go to church. There were callers all the 
afternoon. Jane’s discolored eye attested the 
extent of the injury, though it had been from 
the force with which the heavy door had been 
thrown open. She had come down to dinner 
and was now ensconced in the Morris chair 
with the cushions about her. Habitually pale, 
she had a wan and startled look. 

One and another was relating grievances 
and defacements. 

“ Though it’s not as bad as real paint. 
There was a grotesque figure on my nice 
newly-painted front door — with horns and a 
tail, and even if it was too new to touch I had 
it scrubbed off,” complained a neighbor. 
“ Now it will have to be done over. Mr. Kent 

has been driving the boys out of the apple 



orchard, — we have a few very fine trees and 
we count on what they bring in to us. It is a 
shame to have your property destroyed and 
your crops ruined or stolen.’ 

“ Some stringent measures must be taken to 
stop these depredations,” said Mr. Hildreth. 

“ I don’t know that I am altogether in favor 
of the high school,” continued the indignant 
Mrs. Kent. “ We have had some rest from 
mischief these two years, while the large boys 
have been away, and now it has begun again.” 
“ What about the high school? ” asked Mr. 
Underwood, who had just entered with his 
wife. “ That is the apple of Mr. Hildreth’s 
eye, the idol of his heart,” and he laughed over 
to him. “ Mrs. Stirling, I hope you are not 
suffering from the shock too severely. Noth- 
ing can exceed my regret that you should have 
been made the victim of such a cruel trick.” 

“ I had rather have the high school closed 
than turn out such miscreants,” Mr. Hildreth 
exclaimed indignantly. 

“ But why the high school ? There are boys 
down in the paper mill, in the cloth mill as 
well. Some of them frequent the saloons, 




and many of these mischiefs seem like half- 
drunken capers. I can’t have our boys blamed 
for everything.” 

“ But you see we had comparative peace 
last fall, and the mill boys were there. Most 
of them have been in the public school. You 
should have trained them better, Mr. Under- 
wood.” 

That gentleman flushed with a spasm of 
anger, as he replied: 

“ You seem to forget that boys will be boys 
and that for a few years they are the very 
embodiment of mischief. But they turn out 
very fair men afterward.” 

“Well, I’m thankful I never had a boy!” 
declared Mrs. Kent. 

“ If all the mothers felt that way what would 
we do for husbands,” laughed Mrs. Under- 
wood. 

“ Why, I thought matters were going on 
very nicely with us. Miss Grant has noticed 
the improvement. It isn’t fair to put all the 
blame on us. Miss Grant, take up the cudgels 
for us,” and Mr. Underwood gave her a mean- 
ing look. 


I 

“ I should be sorry to have any boy in the 
school connected with such a positively wicked 
scheme as this and several other pieces of mis- 
chief. But much of it comes back to the utter 
indifference to other people’s belongings. I call 
it dishonesty to mar and destroy what it will 
cost the owner considerable money to replace. 
They had better steal his money; he would 
escape the trouble of repairing.” 

“ Oh, Miss Grant ! that’s pretty hard ! 

They do not really mean ” 

“ Why do they do it, then? They are not so 
ignorant of the consequences. Don’t you sup- 
pose they all knew Mrs. Kent’s hall door must 
be scrubbed off and painted over? And 
marking up fences and steps! We are teach- 
ing civics, interest in homes and grounds and 
towns. Why, then, excuse the marring and 
destruction of them? We see the wrong and 
crime in a tramp and send him to prison. It 
is just as wrong in any one’s son and we ought 
to have the courage to say so.” 

Helen Grant looked lovely as she stood there 
in her brave spirit and fine, fearless honor. 

“ Miss Grant is right,” said Mr. Hildreth. 



“ I do not think we emphasize the justice to 
our neighbor sufficiently. When our fore- 
fathers subscribed to ‘ the pursuit of happi- 
ness ’ they certainly did not mean we should 
wrong our neighbor to get it. And surely 
malicious mischief cannot make any one happy. 
It must be done in secret and kept secret. It 
is a thing to be ashamed of, to be regretted 
later on, if the boy has any manliness in him. 
I wish the perpetrators of this ferreted out.” 
“ You may rest assured I shall do my best,” 
said Mr. Underwood rather sharply. 

Mrs. Underwood had seated herself beside 
Mrs. Stirling. “ I do not believe I should 
have opened the door,” she said. 

“ But Jane would have opened it in the 
morning and the log would have fallen in, per- 
haps knocked her down, as she would not have 
been so cautious. And it did look dreadful in 
the dim light, with those patches of red as if 
some one had been murdered.” 

Mrs. Stirling shuddered even now. 

“ I can’t think who would have done it to 
you,” was the indignant comment. 

“ The boys have never molested me before. 


 

Now I have two young women and I fancy the 
trick was for them. But they had annoyed 
no one, nor made themselves obnoxious. ” 

Had it been meant for Miss Grant? The 
two men had a rather warm discussion, sup- 
plemented by a certain straightforwardness in 
Mrs. Kent, who kept strictly to right and 
wrong. 

“ We are tiring out Mrs. Stirling,’ Mrs. 
Underwood said at length. “ No words can 
adequately express our regret that you and 
Jane should have been such sufferers. And I 
am sure the whole town will be eager to
