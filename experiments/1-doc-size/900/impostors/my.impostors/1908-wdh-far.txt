scene if Horatio had not spoken to the ghost of Hamlet's 
father and taken the chances of being snubbed. Here 
there are no chances of that kind ; the chances are that 
you'll wish the ghost had not been entreated: I think 
that is the phrase." 

In the laugh that followed a girl on Miss Macroyd's 
other hand audibly asked her, " Oh, isn't he too funny f " 

" Delicious !" Miss Macroyd agreed. Verrian felt 
she said it to vex him, 

" Now, there's just one other point," Bushwick re- 
sumed, " and then I have done. Only one question can 
be allowed to each person, but if the questioner is a 
lady she can ask a question and a half, provided she 
is not satisfied with the answer. In this case, however, 


she will only get half an answer. Now I have done, 
and if my arguments have convinced any one within the 
sound of my voice that our ghost really means busi- 
ness, I shall feel fully repaid for the pains and expense 
of getting up these few impromptu remarks, to which 
I have endeavored to give a humorous character, in 
order that you may all laugh your laugh out, and no 
unseemly mirth may interrupt the subsequent pro- 
ceedings. We will now have a little music, and those 
who can recall my words will be allowed to sing them." 

In the giggling and chatter which ensued the chords 
softly played passed into ears that might as well have 
been deaf; but at last there was a general quiescence of 
expectation, in which every one's eyes were strained to 
pierce through the gauze curtain to the sombre drapery 
beyond. The wait was so long that the tension relaxed 
and a whispering began, and Verrian felt a sickness of 
pity for the girl who was probably going to make a fail- 
ure of it. He asked himself what could have happened 
to her. Had she lost courage? Or had her physical 
strength, not yet fully renewed, given way under the 
stress? Or had she, in sheer disgust for the turn the 
affair had been given by that brute Bushwick, thrown 
up the whole business ? He looked round for Mrs. West- 
angle ; she was not there ; he conjectured — he could only 
conjecture — that she was absent conferring with Miss 
Shirley and trying to save the day. 

A long, deeply sighed " Oh-h-h-h !" shuddering from 
many lips made him turn abruptly, and he saw, glim- 
mering against the pall at the bottom of the darkened 
library, a figure vaguely white, in which he recognized 
a pose, a gesture familiar to him. For the others the 
figure was It, but for him it was preciously She. It 
was she, and she was going to carry it through ; she was 
going to triumph, and not fail. A lump came into his 

 

throat, and a mist blurred his eyes, which, when it 
cleared again, left him staring at nothing. 

A girl's young voice uttered the common feeling, 
"Why, is that all?" 

" It is, till some one asks the ghost a question ; then 
it will reappear," Bushwick rose to say. " Will Miss 
Andrews kindly step forward and ask the question near- 
est her heart ?" 

" Oh no !" the girl answered, with a sincerity that 
left no one quite free to laugh. 

" Some other lady, then ?" Bushwick suggested. No 
one moved, and he added, " This is a difficulty which 
had been foreseen. Some gentleman will step forward 
and put the question next his heart." Again no one 
offered to go forward, and there was some muted laugh- 
ter, which Bushwick checked. " This difficulty had 
been foreseen, too. I see that I shall have to make the 
first move, and all that I shall require of the audience 
is that I shall not be supposed to be in collusion with the 
illusion. I hope that after my experience, whatever 
it is, some young woman of courage will follow." 

He passed into the foyer, and from that came into 
the library, where he showed against the dark back- 
ground in an attitude of entreaty slightly burlesqued. 
The ghost reappeared. 

" Shall I marry the woman I am thinking of ?" he 
asked. 

The phantom seemed to hesitate; it wavered like a 
pale reflection cast against the pall. Then, in the tones 
which Verrian knew, the answer came : 

" Ask her. She will tell you." 

The phantom had scored a hit, and the applause 
was silenced with difficulty ; but Verrian felt that Miss 
Shirley had lost ground. It could not have been for 
the easy cleverness of such a retort that she had planned 

 

the affair. Yet, why not ? He was taking it too seri- 
ously. It was merely business with her. 

" And I haven't even the right to half a question 
more !" Bushwick lamented, in a dramatized dejection, 
and crossed slowly back from the library to his place. 

" Why, haven't you got enough ?" one of the men 
asked, amidst the gay clamor of the women. 

The ghost was gone again, and its evanescence was 
discussed with ready wonder. Another of the men went 
round to tempt his fate, and the phantom suddenly re- 
appeared so near him that he got a laugh by his start 
of dismay. " I forgot what I was going to ask, he 
faltered. 

" I know what it was," the apparition answered. 
" You had better sell." 

"But they say it will go to a hundred!" the man 
protested. 

" No back - talk, Bogers !" Bushwick interposed. 
" That was the understanding. 

" But we didn't understand," one of the girls said, 
coming to the rescue, " that the ghost was going to 
answer questions that were not asked. That would give 
us all away." 

" Then the only thing is for you to go and ask before 
it gets a chance to answer," Bushwick said. 

" Well, I will," the girl returned. And she swept 
round into the library, where she encountered the phan- 
tom with a little whoop as it started into sight before 
her. " I'm not going to be scared out of it !" she said, 
defiantly. " It's simply this : Did the person I sus- 
pect really take the ring ?" 

The answer came, " Look on the floor under your 
dressing-table !" 

" Well, if I find it there," the girl addressed the com- 
pany, " I'm a spiritualist from this time forth." And 

 

she came back to her place, where she remained for 
some time explaining to those near how she had lately 
lost her ring and suspected her maid, whom she had dis- 
missed. 

Upon the whole, the effect was serious. The women, 
having once started, needed no more urging. One after 
another they confronted and questioned the oracle with 
increasing sincerity. 

Miss Macroyd asked Verrian, " Hadn't you better 
take your chance and stop this flow of fatuity, Mr. 
Verrian ?" 

" I'm afraid I should be fatuous, too," he said. " But 
you V 

" Oh, thank you, I don't believe in ghosts, though this 
seems to be a very pretty one — very graceful, I mean. 
I suppose a graceful woman would be graceful even 
when a disembodied spirit. I should think she would 
be getting a little tried with all this questioning; but 
perhaps we're only reading the fatigue into her. The 
ghost may be merely overdone." 

" It might easily be that," Verrian assented. 

" Oh, may I ask it something now V a girl's voice 
appealed to Bushwick. It was the voice of that Miss 
Andrews who had spoken first, and first refused to 
question the ghost. She was the youngest of Mrs. 
Westangle's guests, and Verrian had liked her, with a 
sense of something precious in the prolongation of a 
child's unconsciousness into the consciousness of girl- 
hood which he found in her. She was always likelier 
than not to say the thing she thought and felt, whether 
it was silly and absurd, or whether, as also happened, 
there was a touch of inspired significance in it, as there 
is apt to be in the talk of children. She was laughed 
at, but she was liked, and the freshness of her soul was 
pleasant to the girls who were putting on the world 
  

as hard as they could. She could be trusted to do and 
say the unexpected. But she was considered a little 
morbid, and certainly she had an exaltation of the 
nerves that was at times almost beyond her control. 

" Oh, dear !" Miss Macroyd whispered. " What is 
that strange simpleton going to do, I wonder ?" 

Verrian did not feel obliged to answer a ques- 
tion not addressed to him, but he, too, wondered and 
doubted. 

The girl, having got her courage together, fluttered 
with it from her place round to the ghost's in a haste 
that expressed a fear that it might escape her if she 
delayed to put it to the test. The phantom was al- 
ready there, as if it had waited her in the curiosity that 
followed her. They were taking each other seriously, 
the girl and the ghost, and if the ghost had been a 
veridical phantom, in which she could have believed 
with her whole soul, the girl could not have entreated 
it more earnestly, more simply. 

She bent forward, in her slim, tall figure, with her 
hands outstretched, and with her tender voice breaking 
at times in her entreaty. " Oh, I don't know how to 
begin," she said, quite as if she and the phantom were 
alone together, and she had forgotten its supernatural 
awfulness in a sense of its human quality. " But you 
will understand, won't you! You'll think it very 
strange, and it is very unlike the others; but if I'm 
going to be serious — " 

The white figure stood motionless; but Verrian in- 
terpreted its quiet as a kindly intelligence, and the girl 
made a fresh start in a note a little more piteous than 
before. " It's about the — the truth. Do you think if 
sometimes we don't tell it exactly, but we wish we had 
very, very much, it will come round somehow the same 
as if we had told it?" 



" I don't understand," the phantom answered. " Say 
it again — or differently." 

" Can our repentance undo it, or make the falsehood 
over into the truth?" 

" Never !" the ghost answered, with a passion that 
thrilled to Verrian's heart. 

" Oh, dear !" the girl said ; and then, as if she had 
been going to continue, she stopped. 

" You've still got your half -question, Miss Andrews," 
Bushwick interposed. 

" Even if we didn't mean it to deceive harmfully ?" 
the girl pursued. " If it was just on impulse, some- 
thing we couldn't seem to help, and we didn't see it in its 
true light at the time — " 

The ghost made no answer. It stood motionless. 

" It is offended," Bushwick said, without knowing the 
Shakespearian words. " You've asked it three times 
half a question, Miss Andrews. Now, Mr. Verrian, it's 
your turn. You can ask it just one-quarter of a ques- 
tion. Miss Andrews has used up the rest of your share." 

Verrian rose awkwardly and stood a long moment 
before his chair. Then he dropped back again, saying, 
dryly, " I don't think I want to ask it anything." 

The phantom sank straight down as if sinking through 
the floor, but lay there like a white shawl trailed along 
the bottom of the dark curtain. 

" And is that all ?" Miss Macroyd asked Verrian. 
" I was just getting up my courage to go forward. But 
now, I suppose — " 

" Oh, dear !" Miss Andrews called out. " Perhaps 
it's fainted. Hadn't we better — " 

There were formless cries from the women, and the 
men made a crooked rush forward, in which Verrian 
did not join. He remained where he had risen, with 
Miss Macroyd beside him. 



" Perhaps it's only a coup de theatre!" she said, with 
her laugh. " Better wait." 

Bushwick was gathering the prostrate figure up. 
" She has fainted !" he called. " Get some water, some- 
body!" 



XIX 

The early Monday morning train which brought 
Verrian up to town was so very early that he could 
sit down to breakfast with his mother only a little 
later than their usual hour. 

She had called joyfully to him from her room, when 
she heard the rattling of his key as he let himself into 
the apartment, and, after an exchange of greetings, 
shouted back and forth before they saw each other, they 
could come at once to the history of his absence over 
their coffee. " You must have had a very good time, to 
stay so long. After you wrote that you would not be 
back Thursday, I expected it would be Saturday till I 
got your telegram. But I'm glad you stayed. You cer- 
tainly needed the rest." 

" Yes, if those things are ever a rest." He looked 
down at his cup while he stirred the coffee in it, and 
she studied his attitude, since she could not see his 
face fully, for the secret of any vital change that might 
have come upon him. It could be that in the interval 
since she had seen him he had seen the woman who 
was to take him from her. She was always preparing 
herself for that, knowing that it must comte almost as 
certainly as death, and knowing that with all her prepa- 
ration she should not be ready for it. " I've got rather 
a long story to tell you and rather a strange story," he 
said, lifting his head and looking round, but not so 
impersonally that his mother did not know well enough 
to say to the Swedish serving-woman : 

 

" You needn't stay, Margit. I'll give Mr. Philip 
his breakfast. Well !" she added, when they were alone. 

" Well," he returned, with a smile that she knew 
he was forcing, " I have seen the girl that wrote that 
letter." 

" Not Jerusha Brown ?" 

" Not Jerusha Brown, but the girl all the same." 

" Now go on, Philip, and don't miss a single word !" 
she commanded him, with an imperious breathlessness. 
" You know I won't hurry you or interrupt you, but 
you must — you really must — tell me everything. Don't 
leave out the slightest detail." 

" I won't," he said. But she was aware, from time 
to time, that she was keeping her word better than he 
was keeping his, in his account of meeting Miss Shir- 
ley and all the following events. 

" You can imagine," he said, " what a sensation the 
swooning made, and the commotion that followed it." 

" Yes, I can imagine that," she answered. But she 
was yet so faithful that she would not ask him to go on. 

He continued, unasked, " I don't know just how, 
now, to account for its coming into my head that it was 
Miss Andrews who was my unknown correspondent. 
I suppose I've always unconsciously expected to meet 
that girl, and Miss Andrews's hypothetical case was 
psychologically so parallel — " 

"Yes, yes!" 

" And I've sometimes been afraid that I judged it 
too harshly — that it was a mere girlish freak without 
any sort of serious import." 

" I was sometimes afraid so, Philip. But — " 

" And I don't believe now that the hypothetical case 
brought any intolerable stress of conscience upon Miss 
Shirley, or that she fainted from any cause but ex- 
haustion from the general ordeal. She was still weak 

 

from the sickness she had been through — too weak to 
bear the strain of the work she had taken up. Of 
course, the catastrophe gave the whole surface situa- 
tion away, and I must say that those rather banal young 
people behaved very humanely about it. There was 
nothing but interest of the nicest kind, and, if she is 
going on with her career, it will be easy enough for 
her to find engagements after this." 

" Why shouldn't she go on ?" his mother asked, with 
a suspicion which she kept well out of sight. 

" Well, as well as she could explain afterwards, the 
catastrophe took her work out of the category of busi- 
ness and made her acceptance in it a matter of senti- 
ment." 

" She explained it to you herself ?" 

" Yes, the general sympathy had penetrated to Mrs. 
Westangle, though I don't say that she had been more 
than negatively indifferent to Miss Shirley's claim on 
her before. As it was, she sent for me to her room the 
next morning, and I found Miss Shirley alone there. 
She said Mrs. Westangle would be down in a mo- 
ment." 

Now, indeed, Mrs. Verrian could not govern herself 
from saying, " I don't like it, Philip." 

" I knew you wouldn't. It was what I said to my- 
self at the time. You were so present with me that 
I seemed to have you there chaperoning the interview." 
His mother shrugged, and he went on : " She said she 
wished to tell me something first, and then she said, 
' I want to do it while I have the courage, if it's cour- 
age; perhaps it's just desperation. I am Jerusha 
Brown.' " 

His mother began, " But you said — " and then stop- 
ped herself. 

" I know that I said she wasn't, but she explained, 
 

while I sat there rather mum, that there was really an- 
other girl, and that the other girl's name was really 
Jerusha Brown. She was the daughter of the post- 
master in the village where Miss Shirley was passing 
the summer. In fact, Miss Shirley was boarding in 
the postmaster's family, and the girls had become very 
friendly. They were reading my story together, 
and talking about it, and trying to guess how it 
would come out, just as the letter said, and they simul- 
taneously hit upon the notion of writing to me. It 
seemed to them that it would be a good joke — I'm not 
defending it, mother, and I must say Miss Shirley 
didn't defend it, either — to work upon my feelings in 
the way they tried, and they didn't realize what they 
had done till Armiger's letter came. It almost drove 
them wild, she said ; but they had a lucid interval, and 
they took the letter to the girl's father and told him 
what they had done. He was awfully severe with them 
for their foolishness, and said they must write to 
Armiger at once and confess the fact. Then they said 
they had written already, and showed him the second 
letter, and explained they had decided to let Miss Brown 
write it in her person alone for the reason she gave in it. 
But Miss Shirley told him she was ready to take her 
full share of the blame, and, if anything came of it, 
she authorized him to put the whole blame on her." 

Verrian made a pause which his mother took for in- 
vitation or permission to ask, " And was he satisfied 
with that ?" 

" I don't know. I wasn't, and it's only just to Miss 
Shirley to say that she wasn't, either. She didn't try 
to justify it to me; she merely said she was so fright- 
ened that she couldn't have done anything. She may 
have realized more than the Brown girl what they had 
done." 

 

" The postmaster, did he regard it as anything worse 
than foolishness?" 

" I don't believe he did. At any rate, he was satis- 
fied with what his daughter had done in owning up." 

" Well, I always liked that girl's letter. And did 
they show him your letter ?" 

" It seems that they did." 

" And what did he say about that ?" 

" I suppose, what I deserved. Miss Shirley wouldn't 
say, explicitly. He wanted to answer it, but they 
wouldn't let him. I don't know but I should feel bet- 
ter if he had. I haven't been proud of that letter of 
mine as time has gone on, mother; I think I behaved 
very narrow-mindedly, very personally in it." 

" You behaved justly." 

" Justly ? I thought you had your doubts of that. 
At any rate, I had when it came to hearing the girl 
accusing herself as if she had been guilty of some 
monstrous wickedness, and I realized that I had made 
her feel so." 

" She threw herself on your pity !" 

" No, she didn't, mother. Don't make it impossible 
for me to tell you just how it was." 

"I won't. Goon." 

" I don't say she was manly about it ; that couldn't 
be, but she was certainly not throwing herself on my 
pity, unless — unless — " 

"What?" 

" Unless you call it so for her to say that she wanted 
to own up to me, because she could have no rest till she 
had done so ; she couldn't put it behind her till she had 
acknowledged it; she couldn't work; she couldn't get 
well." 

He saw his mother trying to consider it fairly, and 
in response he renewed his own resolution not to make 

 

himself the girl's advocate with her, but to continue the 
dispassionate historian of the case. At the same time 
his memory was filled with the vision of how she had 
done and said the things he was telling, with what 
pathos, with what grace, with what beauty in her ap- 
peal. He saw the tears that came into her eyes at 
times and that she indignantly repressed as she hur- 
ried on in the confession which she was voluntarily 
making, for there was no outward stress upon her to 
say anything. He felt again the charm of the situa- 
tion, the sort of warmth and intimacy, but he resolved 
not to let that feeling offset the impartiality of his 
story. 

" Wo, I don't say she threw herself on your mercy," 
his mother said, finally. " She needn't have told you 
anything." 

" Except for the reason she gave — that she couldn't 
make a start for herself till she had done so. And 
she has got her own way to make; she is poor. Of 
course, you may say her motive was an obsession, and 
not a reason." 

" There's reality in it, whatever it is ; it's a genuine 
motive," Mrs. Verrian conceded. 

" I think so," Verrian said, in a voice which he tried 
to keep from sounding too grateful. 

Apparently his mother did not find it so. She asked, 
" What had been the matter with her, did she say ?" 

" In her long sickness ? Oh ! A nervous fever of 
some sort." 

" From worrying about that experience ?" 

Verrian reluctantly admitted, " She said it made her 
want to die. I don't suppose we can quite realize — " 

" We needn't believe everything she said to realize 
that she suffered. But girls exaggerate their sufferings. 
I suppose you told her not to think of it any more ?" 

 

Verrian gave an odd laugh. " Well, not uncondi- 
tionally. I tried to give her my point of view. And 
I stipulated that she should tell Jerusha Brown all about 
it, and keep her from having a nervous fever, too." 

" That was right. You must see that even cowardice 
couldn't excuse her selfishness in letting that girl take 
all the chances." 

" And I'm afraid I was not very unselfish myself in 
my stipulations," Verrian said, with another laugh. " I 
think that I wanted to stand well with the postmaster." 

There was a note of cynical ease in this which Mrs. 
Verrian found morally some octaves lower than the 
pitch of her son's habitual seriousness in what con- 
cerned himself, but she could not make it a censure to 
him. " And you were able to reassure her, so that she 
needn't think of it any more ?" 

" What would you have wished me to do ?" he re- 
turned, dryly. "Don't you think she had suffered 
enough ?" 

" Oh, in this sort of thing it doesn't seem the ques- 
tion of suffering. If there's wrong done the penalty 
doesn't right it." 

The notion struck Verrian's artistic sense. " That's 
true. That would make the donnee of a strong story. 
Or a play. It's a drama of fate. It's Greek. But I 
thought we lived under another dispensation." 

" Will she try to get more of the kind of thing she 
was doing for Mrs. Westangle at once? Or has she 
some people?" 

" No ; only friends, as I understand." 

" Where is she from ? Up country ?" 

" No, she's from the South." 

" I don't like Southerners !" 

" I know you don't, mother. But you must honor 
the way they work and get on when they come North 

 

and begin doing for themselves. Besides, Miss Shirley's 
family went South after the war — " 

" Oh, not even a real Southerner !" 

"Mother!" 

" I know ! I'm not fair. I ought to beg her pardon. 
And I ought to be glad it's all over. Shall you see 
her again ?" 

" It might happen. But I don't know how or when. 
We parted friends, but we parted strangers, so far as 
any prevision of the future is concerned," Verrian said. 

His mother drew a long breath, which she tried to 
render inaudible. " And the girl that asked her the 
strange questions, did you see her again ?" 

" Oh yes. She had a curious fascination. I should 
like to tell you about her. Do you think there's such 
a thing as a girl's being too innocent V 

" It isn't so common as not being innocent enough." 

"But it's more difficult ?" 

" I hope you'll never find it so, my son," Mrs. Ver- 
rian said. And for the first time she was intentionally 
personal. " Go on." 

" About Miss Andrews ?" 

" Whichever you please." 

" She waylaid me in the afternoon, as I was coming 
home from a walk, and wanted to talk with me about 
Miss Shirley." 

" I suppose Miss Shirley was the day's heroine after 
what had happened ?" 

" The half-day's, or quarter-day's heroine, perhaps. 
She left on the church train for town yesterday morn- 
ing soon after I saw her. Miss Andrews seemed to 
think I was an authority on the subject, and she ap- 
proached me with a large-eyed awe that was very amus- 
ing, though it was affecting, too. I suppose that girls 
must have many worships for other girls before they 

 

have any worship for a man. This girl couldn't sepa- 
rate Miss Shirley, on the lookout for another engage- 
ment, from the psychical part she had played. She 
raved about her; she thought she was beautiful, and 
she wanted to know all about her and how she could 
help her. Miss Andrews's parents are rich but respect- 
able, I understand, and she's an only child. I came 
in for a share of her awe ; she had found out that I was 
not only not Verrian the actor, but an author of the 
same name, and she had read my story with passionate 
interest, but apparently in that unliterary way of many 
people withoiit noticing who wrote it; she seemed to 
have thought it was Harding Davis or Henry James; 
she wasn't clear which. But it was a good deal to have 
had her read it at all in that house ; I don't believe any- 
body else had, except Miss Shirley and Miss Mac- 
royd." 

Mrs. Verrian deferred a matter that would ordinarily 
have interested her supremely to an immediate curiosity. 
" And how came she to think you woiild know so much 
about Miss Shirley ?" 

Verrian frowned. " I think from Miss Macroyd. 
Miss Macroyd seems to have taken a grandmotherly con- 
cern in my affairs through the whole week. Perhaps 
she resented having behaved so piggishly at the station 
the day we came, and meant to take it out of Miss 
Shirley and myself. She had seen us together in the 
woods, one day, and she must have told it about. Mrs. 
Westangle wouldn't have spoken of us together, because 
she never speaks of anything unless it is going to count ; 
and there was no one else who knew of our acquaint- 
ance." 

" Why, my son, if you went walking in the woods 
with the girl, any one might have seen you." 

" I didn't. It was quite by accident that we met 


there. Miss Shirley was anxious to keep her presence 
in the house a secret from everybody." 

Mrs. Verrian would not take any but the open way 
with this. She would not deal indirectly with it, or 
in any wise covertly or surreptitiously. " It seems to 
me that Miss Shirley has rather a fondness for secrecy," 
she said. 

" I think she has," Verrian admitted. " Though, in 
this case, it was essential to the success of her final 
scheme. But she is a curious study. I suppose that 
timidity is at the bottom of all fondness for secrecy, 
isn't it?" 

" I don't know. She doesn't seem to be timid in 
everything." 

" Say it out, mother !" Verrian challenged her with 
a smile. " You're not timid, anyway !" 

" She had the courage to join in that letter, but not 
the courage to own her part in it. She was brave enough 
to confess that she had been sick of a nervous fever 
from the answer you wrote to the Brown girl, but she 
wouldn't have been brave enough to confess anything at 
all if she had believed she would be physically or moral- 
ly strong enough to keep it." 

" Perhaps nobody — nobody but you, mother — is 
brave in the right time and place." 

She knew that this was not meant in irony. " I am 
glad you say that, Philip." 

" It's only your due. But aren't you a little too hard 
upon cowards, at times ? For the sort of person she is, 
if you infer the sort from the worst appearance she 
has made in the whole business, I think she has done 
pretty well." 

" Why had she left the Brown girl to take all your 
resentment alone for the last six or eight months ?" 

" She may have thought that she was getting her share 
 

of the punishment in the fever my resentment brought 
on?" 

" Philip, do you really believe that her fever, if she 
had one, came from that ?" 

" I think she believes it, and there's no doubt but she 
was badly scared." 

" Oh, there's no doubt of that !" 

" But come, mother, why should we take her at the 
worst? Of course, sbe has a complex nature. I see 
that as clearly as you do. I don't believe we look at 
her diversely, in the smallest particular. But why 
shouldn't a complex nature be credited with tbe same 
impulses towards tbe truth as a single nature ? Why 
shouldn't we allow that Miss Shirley had the same wish 
to set herself right with me as Miss Andrews would 
have had in her place ?" 

" I dare say she wished to set herself right with you, 
but not from the same wish that Miss Andrews would 
have had. Miss Andrews would not have wished you 
to know the truth for her own sake. Her motive would 
have been direct — straight." 

" Yes ; and we will describe her as a straight line, 
and Miss Shirley as a waving line. Why shouldn't the 
waving line, at its highest points, touch the same alti- 
tude as the straight line ?" 

" It wouldn't touch it all the time, and in character, 
or nature, as you call it, that is the great thing. It's 
at the lowest points that the waving line is dangerous." 

" Well, I don't deny that. But I'm anxious to be 
just to a person who hasn't experienced a great deal of 
mercy for what, after all, wasn't such a very heinous 
thing as I used to think it. You must allow that she 
wasn't obliged to tell me anything about herself." 

" Yes, she was, Philip. As I said before, she hadn't 
the physical or moral strength to keep it from you when 

 

she was brought face to face with you. Besides — " 
Mrs. Verrian hesitated. 

" Out with it, mother ! We, at least, won't have any 
concealments." 

" She may have thought she could clinch it in that 
way." 

"Clinch what?" 

" You know. Is she pretty ?" 

" She's — interesting." 

" That can always be managed. Is she tall ?" 

" No, I think she's rather out of style there ; she's 
rather petite." 

" And what's her face like ?" 

" Well, she has no particular complexion, but it's not 
thick. Her eyes are the best of her, though there isn't 
much of them. They're the ' waters on a starry night ' 
sort, very sweet and glimmering. She has a kind of 
ground-colored hair and a nice little chin. Her mouth 
helps her eyes out; it looks best when she speaks; it's 
pathetic in the play of the lips." 

" I see," Mrs. Verrian said.

The following week Verrian and his mother were 
at a show of paintings, in the gallery at the rear of a 
dealer's shop, and while they were bending together 
to look at a picture he heard himself called to in a 
girlish voice, " Oh, Mr. Verrian !" as if his being there 
was the greatest wonder in the world. 

His mother and he lifted themselves to encounter a 
tall, slim girl, who was stretching her hand towards him, 
and who now cried out, joyously, " Oh, Mr. Verrian, 
I thought it must be you, but I was afraid it wasn't as 
soon as I spoke. Oh, I'm so glad to see you; I want 
so much to have you know my mother — Mr. Verrian," 
she said, presenting him. 

" And I you mine," Verrian responded, in a violent 
ellipse, and introduced his own mother, who took in 
the fact of Miss Andrews's tall thinness, topped with 
a wide, white hat and waving white plumes, and her 
little face, irregular and somewhat gaunt, but with a 
charm in the lips and eyes which took the elder woman's 
heart with pathos. She made talk with Mrs. Andrews, 
who affected one as having the materials of social 
severity in her costume and manner. 

" Oh, I didn't believe I should ever see you again," 
the girl broke out impulsively upon Verrian. " Oh, I 
wanted to ask you so about Miss Shirley. Have you 
seen her since you got back ?" 

" No," Verrian said, " I haven't seen her." 

" Oh, I thought perhaps you had. I've been to the 
»  

address that Mrs. Westangle gave me, but she isn't there 
any more; she's gone up into Harlem somewhere, and 
I haven't been able to call again. Oh, I do feel so 
anxious about her. Oh, I do hope she isn't ill. Do 
you think she is ?" 

" I don't believe so," Verrian began. But she swept 
over his prostrate remark. 

" Oh, Mr. Verrian, don't you think she's wonderful ? 
I've been telling mother about it, and I don't feel at 
all the way she does. Do you ?" 

"How does she feel? I must know that before I 
say." 

" Why, of course ! I hadn't told you ! She thinks 
it was a make-up between Miss Shirley and that Mr. 
Bushwick. But I say it couldn't have been. Do you 
think it could?" 

Verrian found the suggestion so distasteful, for a 
reason which he did not quite seize himself, that he
