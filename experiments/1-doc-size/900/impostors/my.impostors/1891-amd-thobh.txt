thought comes to her. He will marry her. She is just the 
sympathetic, appreciative kind of woman that he needs, 
who will make him happy, — immeasurably so. It leaves 
a great blank and coldness in her soul, not because she 
loves him, but that the best gifts of life are likely to pass 
her by. All of her ideals have been too high : she recog- 
nizes this sadly. 

Yet she looks brightly across at him. Now she wants to 
do him full justice, to make amends for the scant measure 
she has dealt out to him. As a friend she can do this. 
Her sincerity is evident ; it softens the firm lines in her 
face, and he, watching her in a diffident, neutral fashion, 
is rather doubtful, yet wholly delighted. 

He does not plume himself on any conquest. It is enough 
just now to be on the simplest terms of friendship. He 
means to stretch it a long way, to make it. cover a great 
many points. • ., _ 

" You will not mind my coming again ? " he asks per- 
suasively ; " I promised Cynthia. And I miss them so 
much, all the friendly home interest and delight. I have 
bepu quite spoiled of late." 

" Yes," she answers softly, glancing up utterly uncon- 
scious of the deeper meaning on his part. 



 

In a vagne, mysterious mood she goes to her room, won- 
dering why this matter does not touch her more keenly 
regards herself. She is not jealous, she is not stirred, not 
excited, neither does she feel to blaine him for transferring 
his allegiance to another ; she has simply put him out of 
her life, and he has at last comprehended the fact. There 
is a sacred kind of gladness that through all the long time 
when they knew nothing of each other he never wavered 
in his fancy. He was her loyal lover. Her sincere desire 
to accept the consequence of her own act keeps her from 
the consciousness of sacrifice ; to her at present there is 
none. She cannot suffer over a love lost, for she has never 
given any.. He has generously desired to shield her from 
the inconvenience of poverty — she can understand this 
now — it was because he fancied her so illy fitted to cope 
with it. An agony of scarlet drenches her face as she 
thinks of this low estimate ; but she will meet bravely the 
consequences of her labored impression — it must have 
been that. Cynthia — how happy Cynthia will be ! just 
the bright, eager sort of happiness that she enjoys. For 
a moment Regina Halford wishes — what ? That she had 
made this late choice in the beginning, that she had not 
to retrace so many steps, to see so many dethroned, useless 
ideals, staring her in the face with their blind, dumb eyes. 

Still, she is not the first who has lived out of and over 
grave mistakes. Youth is hers, health, opportunity. In- 
deed, she sees rare and golden ones if she has the courage 
to take them. Whatever has been best and truest in her 
desires seems to rise in her soul to-night like a high tide. 
Is it because she is glad of another's happiness ? Is it 
because the true inspiration has reached her at last ? She 
lies there in a strange, ineffable content, and when morn- 
ing dawns she hardly knows whether she has slept or not. 

Perdita is weak and miserable after her day of excite- 
ment. Eegina reads to her a pretty, heart-breaking story, 
but she will have it — a story of sin and suffering, of repent- 
ance and final happiness. Not in so high a key that it is 
above her comprehension. 



There has been a shower in the morning ; everything is 
eaii and bright, and filled with wonderful fragrance. In 
the late afternoon Regina coaxes her out to drive, and it 
does brighten her. They pass several acquaintances who 
nod in a friendly fashion. Part of the town has gone out 
oil its summering ; strangers have come in. Phaetons, 
iio,f-oarts, and glittering bnc'kboards bowl along the wide, 
shiuled streets. 

Oddly enough it is quite a prevalent whim to drive up 
to Bradley House. It is a rather picturesque niin with its 
broken and blackened stone walls, that have defied wind 
and storm for so many years ; and now it is one of the old 
places with a story. 

They go around by the post-office. 

" Oh," says Perdita with a faint smile, " how natural it 
all seems ! Cynthia and I used to come down, you remem- 
ber. Were you not lost when you gave up Dolly ? And — 
would you mind very much if you took me up to Bradley 
House some day ? " 

" We will go any morning you like." 

She cannot face the idle pleasure-seekers in the after- 
noon, and perhaps have Perdita pointed out as the heroine 
of a rather mysterious occurrence. 

" Can yon hold Dolly ? " Eegina places the reins in her 
useless looking little hands. 

Perdita laughs. 

There is a letter from Cynthia. AnotheT note in a bold, 
firm hand — why should it startle her ? She tears the 
end of the envelope. On a half sheet of business paper 
there are a few lines that beg her not to mention to Cynthia 
the prevailing sickness at Warwick ; he would he sorry to 
have the pilgrims needlessly alarmed. 

Dr. Parker has stopped to speak to Perdita. A faint 
pink of pleasurable emotion has crept into the brown 
cheeks. Perdita looks like a foreigner with her unusual 
tints. She does not mind being stared at. Regina would 
shrink with sensitive pain ; she does as it is, but she 
nerves herself and keeps calm. 



 

It is a full week before Winterbuvne ventures to repeat 
his call. Perdita is able to see company, indeed, is improv- 
ing steadily. There are alternations of moods, but when 
she is most herself, she shrinks from the prospect of meet- 
ing her husband. Indeed, her romance is fast fading from 
its brilliant tints to gray ashes. She has an inner mis- 
giving that its consequences will be more unpleasant than 
she has supposed. This clearer atmosphere defines matters 
more strictly. Eegina softens, but she does not make 
futile compromises, her own experience has proved too 
bitter. Mrs. Halford comforts, but even she cannot dis- 
guise the fact that Perdita has thrown away the sweet 
liberty of her girlhood, the richness of a true, chei-ishing 
love for this wild, tumultuous passion. Jasper Bradley's 
name will always have attached to it some sort of stigma. 
He cannot be proved entirely innocent, Perdita knows, even 
if the actual crime is not fastened upon him. If she had 
been ignorant of it all, her imprudence would be a lighter 
burden. Still she is not forever snatching at her soul 
and drenching it in seas of remorse. She suffers acutely 
for a while, then her natural buoyancy asserts itself. 

On this second visit of Winterburne's, which is made a 
family matter, Perdita quite surprises Kegina by a certain 
aplomb that her experience of society has given her. She 
is entertaining in a bright, felicitous manner, even if it is 
superficial. Her pretty graces that she has learned to use 
for Jasper become her charmingly. Regina sits rather 
silent and amazed, as they toss bits of bright talk to and 
fro. It is elusive, hardly to be defined, cheery. Cynthia 
has this gift. After all, is it to be despised ? 

Norman Winterburne thinks not, as he drops the sorrows 
and cares and anxieties that beset his path. He is glad if 
she can be happy. Eegina would be weighed down in the 
dust under this burden. As he listens, he watches the 
proud, beautiful girl. Oh, what save love can take her out 
in the open beyond, in the " sunshine calm and sweet ! " 
If she would throw aside this restraining influence, and let 
herself drift to a glad haven ! She has been making the 





efforts of her life impersonal, yet it is not the large and 
sweet renunciation of self, the life in the midst of human 
wants and affections, the tender beneficence where the 
earthly and commoner duties subserve the divine. She 
has gone a little way — will she halt and grope about? 
Will she let some strong arm guide her hesitating .steps ? 
How is a man to cross over this wide ocean of uncer- 
tainty ? 

Perdita details her small enjoyments, her improvements, 
and some of her desires. 

" I want a violin," she says in her soft yet insistent 
manner. " There are none to be had here, and I don't feel 
competent to judge. Do you know of any one ? " she turns 
her small, dark face to Winterburne, and the eyes 'are 
alight with artistic fervor. 

" It is too soon to begin. You are not strong enough," 
protests Eegina in a throb of agonized humiliation. 

" I get so weary of doing nothing." Her voice is pathet- 
ically sweet. "I read, but I can't go through your wise 
tomes, Eegina. And I like verses — the kind that sing 
themselves. I'm not intellectual, I don't love to study. 
So when the rainy days come, T creep into bed and cry. I 
should feel so much better playing the violin in some cor- 
ner. It is so sweet. It is a human voice talking to you, a 
sort of disembodied spirit that comes at your summons, 
and with it you go off to enchanted realms." 

Her face is eager, shining, inspired. Winterburne has 
never seen her in such a glow of longing. Like Regina, 
he feels that the violin has played a rather fatal part in 
luring her to misfortune, and he should want never to hear 
the sound. But if it is her life ! 

" Why, yes," he says cheerfully. " And if I haven't a 
friend whose musical judgment I can trust, I know Ariiii- 
tage has. He was in all that wonderful musical and artistic 
circle in the city. Sometimes I wonder how he can throw 
himself heart and soul in the work over there," nodding 
southward. " He can make a larger mark in the world when 
he chooses. But I've been more than thankful to have him. 
Of course we will see about vonr violin." 



 

"Oh, thank you a thousand times," Perdita cries joyfully. 

After he has gone she twines her arms passionately 
about Regina's neck. 

" Are you very angry ? " she beseeches, as if she would 
disarm displeasure. " You see, I feel quite different about 
Mr. Winterburue — he was like a brother. He is so large 
and generous and restful ; one could go to him in any 
stress, sure of comfort. And he doesn't mind. I think he 
likes to be asked for help and assistance. Re, I can't un- 
derstand about your curious dislike j" and the straight 
brows are drawn together in .perplexity. 

"I — I don't dislike. I am not demonstrative," she re- 
plies weakly, excusingly. 

" He will have to be the brother out of the Bradley ark 
of relationship for us. And we must all appreciate him," 
Perdita says with gentle gravity. 

" Cynthia — likes him " — it seems wrested from Regina, 
a passionate admission to right herself. 

"And he likes Cynthia. But there is some one who 
Icmes Cynthia. I have seen it." She nods her head confi- 
dently. "And — Re" — she presses the slowly yielding 
figure with sudden passion, while her voice falters through 
a prescient tremulousness. 

Whatever secret trembles on the lips Regina kisses back 
again. 







CHAPTEE XXVII 

rOR HIS SAKE 

Every young man haa a fine season in hia life wlien lie will accept no office, 
and every young woman has the same when ahe will, accept no husband. By 
and by they obaage and take one another in the bargain. — Jisan Paul Richteu. 

Peedita is delighted when a note comes to her announ- 
cing Winterburne's successful quest, and that he will de- 
liver the precious article in safety on a certain evening. 
There has been a curious truce between her and Eegina 
that brings about an unwonted gentleness on both sides. 
The weather has proved very trying  hot and moist with 
drenching showers, and scorching sunshine almost before 
the rain has ceased. 

The evening comes, but it does not bring the promised 
visitor. Perdita waits impatiently after the trains come 
in, lingers on the porch, and ventures down the path. 
Mrs. Halford has a besetting fear that she may be spirited 
away. 

"I do not think Jasper will ever want me again," she 
says reassuringly, yet with a certain sadness. She would 
rather stay here in a kind of joyous liberty, but one can- 
not put even the semblance of love underground without 
moments of regret. 

" Something has happened ! " she cries in a vehement 
fashion. " Re, suppose he has beeju taken with the 
fever ! Even if Mr. Armitage were, he would not leave 
him, only he would send word. And if he is alone there 
and ill ! He is so good to everybody else ! Why, we ought 
to go and care for him ! " 

Perdita is fertile in impossible methods that wear a prac- 
tical semblance. Eegina shudders. She has not considered 
the fever as any personal matter. It has been confined 



 

among the poor, and once or twice almost stamped, out. 
I iideed, he had not referred to it during Ms last call. But 
all this time he has been in danger and Armitage as well. 
She endeavors to be severely impartial. Indeed, as an ad- 
mirer of Cynthia's he has a certain claim upon her atten- 
tion. She tries to recall her sister's references to him. 
He has a high appreciation of her literary efforts, and is 
intensely proud of her success. Tbey have certain affini- 
ties in this large work for humanity. But she cannot dis- 
cern any point in which Winterburne suffers by contrast. 
He, too, gives of his manful strength and comprehensive 
abilities. 

Regina Halford has a nervous, wakeful night. There is 
really nothing on her mind, she tells herself, unless it is 
the vague apprehension of the coming will contest. Oddly 
enough that seems to have settled into a firm belief that 
the first award of the law was just. She solaces herself 
with favorite poems ; she tries to recall some fine points in 
a magazine article on one of the industrial problems of the 
day, but her mind does not obey its usual methodic guid- 
ance. 

Towards morning there comes a beneficent suggestion of 
bracing autumnal weather. The air is crisp and clear, the 
murkiness and moisture have vanished. The sky is a bril- 
liant blue to its farthest depths, the sun shines in magnifi- 
cent splendor. Even a little fire does not come amiss in 
the breakfast-room. 

Perdita is cross and cold. It will all be right when the 
world gets warmed up, no doubt ; but she wants a shawl 
about her, and her chair close to the cheerful blaze on the 
hearth. She looks pinched and wan, and this morning is 
not pretty. 

Regina goes out alone to attend to the daily wants of the 
household. It is quite the fashion iu Beverly. Everybody 
comments upon the unusual fineness of the day until she 
meets Mr. Sayre hurrying along. 

"Have you heard?" — he begins abruptly. "But you 
could not — there was, or might have been, a frightful acci- 





dent last evening at Warwick station. I don't know the 
straight of it myself, but I am going down to see. There 
was the inevitable conjunction, — a special with railroad 
officials whizzing along, a train coming in, a drunken man, 
and Winterburne. Why he should have been in the melee 
— but he is everywhere," and he gives an irritated half 
pause. 

" Not hurt — not " — Eegina Halford seems stricken to 
stone. Who could fill the large place in the world if he 
went out of it ? 

" Well, not killed. First the word was that his leg 
was cut off, then his arm. The other fellow wouldn't have 
been much loss. You Bradleys seem to go naturally to the 
tragic side," he subjoins resentfully. 

Eegina stares with wide, terrified eyes. 

"There's my train. I'll bring back the report. As if 
it wasn't enough for him to stay there in that fever-stricken 
hole ! " Then he waves a formal adieu with his hand, and 
hurries down the street. 

On Regina's return she finds Perdita thawed out, but in 
a rather fretful, wondering state because there is no note 
to explain. She simply cannot talk over the matter, but 
fills every moment with duties, and then takes up a difiicult 
piano exercise. 

"If I only had my violin!" bewails Perdita. "We 
could play duets, as you and Jasper used." 

It is only by a supreme effort of will that Eegina goes 
on unheeding the small creature beside her, whose careless 
words have a keen, wasp-like sting. Why does all the old 
life, the past summer, rise up like a flood-tide and threaten 
to ingulf her as she wanders on a mysterious shore, stricken 
with a nameless terror, impelled forward, yet clinging to 
the very weeds and debris that give her no foothold and 
alike slip through her hands ? She knows the crisis of her 
life has come upon her and found her with only a few in- 
effectual weapons to ward it off. That she will not succeed 
comes to her in a vague, penetrative consciousness that 
envelops her like a midnight cloud in which she can only 
grope blindly. 



 

At noon Mr. Sayre's office-boy appears with a laconic 
note. It is directed to Miss Halford, and she is at the 
door to receive it. 

" Arm broken. Have brought him home with me." 

A great flood of thankfulness surges over her. He will 
not die, he will not be maimed. Now she can go her way 
enfranchised from this awesome terror that has grasped her 
very soul. She draws a long, triumphant breath. She can 
explain — it will be much less awkward than when he 
comes. She wants no secret of his to hamper her. 

" What is it ? " asks Perdita, who has seen the boy from 
her window up-stairs. " Not " — 

" Not Jasper. Oh, no." How suddenly tranquil she is ! 
" I will tell you why you did not get your violin. Come 
to mother," and she leads the way, briefly repeating her 
small adventure of the morning, and handing the note to 
impatient Perdita, who asks a dozen questions in a breath. 

" We shall hear how it happened," she says in an arid, 
almost impatient tone. " Conjecture is useless." 

" And he might have been killed ! Regina, do you care 
for anybody ? " Perdita stamps her small foot upon the 
floor. " Will he come, do you think ? Or ought we to go 
to the Sayres' ? " 

" A broken arm does not prevent journeying about," she 
says tremulously. 

He will come soon enough for her. She would like to 
delay it indefinitely. What it will be she does not formu- 
late even in her thoughts ; neither does she ask herself any 
questions. She seems to have passed beyond the inward 
control so certain heretofore ; she can only stand in that 
awesome, breathless mood. 

To Perdita never were moments so leaden. She is ex- 
cited to the uttermost. She puts on a gown, then dislikes 
herself and changes it for another. She gathers great 
clusters of flowers and thrusts them in her belt; she 
hovers about like a restless bird. It might be her lover, 
Regina thinks in dismay. She sits in her room in yester- 





day's white gown, with no ornament, not even a flower, at 
her throat. And it seems the merest space of time when 
. she hears an exclamation, her own name called, and a step 
on the flags below. She looks down with a swift shiver in 
her blood, her pulses throb, she can feel the scarlet heat in ' 
her cheek. If she might fly to the ends of the earth ! It 
appears in that instant as if flight were her only resource. 
How can she meet him ? 

His step is not so strong and imperious, there is a new 
languor in his face which has been robbed of its brilliant 
coloring. His left arm is in a sling. As he turns toward 
the porch she catches the direction of the intent, searching 
eyes. Perdita, with a child's eagerness, runs down the steps 
to meet him. She hears her mother's gentle tone through 
the wide open door, and then goes slowly, the white wraith 
following behind, like quivering billows. She steps out 
blindly. He has both hands in the one of his — did she 
give them — did he take them ? — All is confusion as if 
she were miles deep in the sea, and the waves chanting 
their murmurous diapason over her. 

" No," he is saying in answer to Perdita, " I am not very 
much of a hero, though I shall come in for some news- 
paper glory, I dare say. It was only a little presence of 
mind and a strong arm. A moment later it would have 
been all over with the poor fellow ! He was crazed with 
grief. He had that morning buried the second child in a 
month. I suppose he thought drinking the only remedy 
for his anguish, — what did the poor wife do at home to 
assuage hers ? And he was blindly, shamefully drunk — 
that is the terrible factor in it. I was carrying your pre- 
cious violin, Perdita" — he glances over at her, still holding 
in his the hands that were ice cold a moment since, and are 
now throbbing in great pulses of fire. " No one was think- 
ing of the special, at least, not among the bystanders. 
Braxton staggered on the track, there was a whiz and a 
blinding flare of light and a cry from half a dozen throats, 
and somehow we rolled over together, outside the track ; 
that was enough. It was Braxton falling on me that broke 



 

my arm and wrenched my shoulder. The only thing really 
bi-uised and mangled and ground to powder was your pretty 
violin asleep in its case, Perdita ; and there are others in 
the world. If you want to' cry at all, you must weep over 
that poor little martyr." 

Still holding one hand, he leads Eegina to the willow 
chair laced with soft red ribbons, and takes the seat beside 
her. He has impelled her to meet him on his own ground, 
he has not reached up to her prideful remoteness. She has 
flushed and throbbed, and sits downcast and trembling. He 
is not the suppliant but the master. 

" You are very pale," Mrs. Halford says alarmed. " Will 
you have a glass of water ? " 

For a brief instant he has the sensation of fainting. The 
joy of his- victory has well-nigh overcome him. 

" No," he says with a long, quivering breath. He cannot 
send the two away. And if he could — he is too merciful 
to put her to any deeper strain. 

" A man gets a little shaken up under such circumstances. 
I didn't sleep at all — of course, I didn't go home. A 
good Samaritan took me in, and" — he laughs softly, more 
from that tremendous overflow of emotion than any sense 
of amusement — " bound up my wounds and comforted me 
generally ; but I don't know as any money passed in the 
transaction," and there is a gleam of humor in his deep, 
luminous eyes. " Then this morning, who should come to 
hand but Mr. Sayre, and he insisted on bringing me home 
and making much of me. He believes he has a mortgage 
on me until the 10th of September." 

" But you look so very tired, so exhausted." All Mrs. 
Halford's motherly instincts are aroused. "Perhaps it 
would be more comfortable for you to lie on the sofa in the 
parlor ? " 

" I have been ' cuddled ' — isn't that the word ? " and he 
smiles over at Perdita. "Mrs. Sayre is enchanting. In 
fact, she would hardly allow me to come out. I am under 
marching orders for nine o'clock sharp." 

Perdita gives a long, sighing breath. The story has not 





been sufficiently explicit. She can think of twenty points 
that need elaborating, and she plies him with eager ques- 
tions. There is a charm in his simplicity, in las touches 
of exaggerative humor, that wards off the danger and the 
pathos, that keeps the episode to the strong, friendly com- 
monplace. All the same, Regina Halford knows that two 
lives have come very near a fatal termination, and she won- 
ders if the worthless one could ever counterbalance the 
other, even in God's sight. For now she is quite ready to 
give that other its full due. She is passionately eager 
to confess her sins, to make all honorable amends, to go 
her way. 

Mrs. Halford presently goes in to see about the supper, 
though Martha is in every respect efficient. Perdita's 
flowers begin to wither, and she saunters among the gar- 
den beds. There is an open space at the south side, a 
driveway with a border of hardy, old-fashioned plants, and 
she is presently lost to sight. The vines are between them 
and the outside world. Winterburne leans over until his 
breath makes a summer air upon her cheek, turning it 
scarlet. He sees the rise and fall of the throbbing, 
tumultuous heart, and he knows, by the divine assurance 
given in such moments, that its beating pulsation is quite 
at his mercy. 

" Regina," it is the faintest whisper. 

" Oh, do not, do not ! " she entreats pitifully. 

He carries her hand to his lips in a transport, then, as 
she makes an unmistakable movement of flight, his right 
arm restrains, her head droops, the soft lieat of the scarlet 
cheek kindles the daring of manhood's ardent love, and he 
has possessed himself of her dewy, tremulous lips, set his 
seal of an inalienable right. 

There are two birds answering each other from leafy 
coverts, a murmur in the leaves, a mysterious sweetness 
in the air. Ah, if she dared go and dwell in that enchanted 
country ! 

It is but a moment before Perdita's dress flutters back 
again. They are in the old world, but all has changed. 



 

She rises then and he lets her go ; he cannot be cruel when 
he has won so much. 

Regina flies to her own room, and clasping her hands over 
her face, hides both on the friendly pillow, not resisting, but 
letting the current sweep over her. He has invaded her 
whole being with his potent personality. Try as she may, 
she cannot reassume that central self-possession, from behind 
which she had defended herself. 

He has yielded to the persuasions of Mr. Sayre and the 
insistence of Armitage, and promised to spend a few days 
away from business and the sorrowful work that has pressed 
so heavily upon them. The cases of fever and other sum- 
mer troubles are abating. Only a few are seriously ill. 
Old Mr. Farrand's life is drawing to a close, and the young 
clergyman is now his steadfast friend. But when that is 
over he means to send him to the seaside to join Alice and 
Cynthia, who are to be kept there for some time yet, until 
cleanliness, science, and the cooler weather have restored 
Warwick to a state of safety. 

The supper is a cheerful meal, even if Eegina is silent. 
She does not abound in light- and merry small talk, even at 
the best of times. Afterward, he insists that they shall 
go for a walk, the evening is so fine. Since he must be in 
bed early, he cannot be defrauded of everything, he declares 
protestingly. 

There is a young crescent moon hanging goldenly against 
the blue, and stars are studded thick. But they walk under 
the trees amid the songs of the night, at first in sweet, 
awesome silence. He thinks it enough to have her here, 
half-won. He could go on forever, but he knows the strenu- 
* oils nature is not at peace even with itself. 

"But you love me," he says exultantly, as if half to 
himself. " At last you love me ! You cannot deny me 
now." 

"I must tell you" — her voice is faint and wandering 
like the night wind. " You have mistaken me. I am not 
as you think. I cannot let you deceive yourself. And 
there is Cynthia," she will say it. " She is better, nobler, 





slie has steadfast purposes, slie has the power of doing. 
And I — I dream — I have dreamed of myself only. I have 
been narrow, grudging, unjust, cowardly. Your life is so 
infinitely larger, better, and nobler than I would admit at 
first — a larger woman must be set in it. I cannot, I 
cannot ! " 

Her tone pierces him with a delicious pain. He is too 
generous to desire to humble her. 

"I have always loved you," he says. "Back in that 
old time, do you remember ? And I have gone astray as 
well. Even then I wanted to set you in the ' large room.' 
You were so stately and fair, you secretly fretted against 
your limitations, I saw that. I meant to be rich for your 
sake. And if all women could inspire men with that larger 
ideal, there would be less want and misery and wretched 
living. There is a great deal of romancing, but a life of 
poverty is hard beyond compare. I wonder that women 
venture in it ! They are noble and generous to a fault." 

"I was not that noble. And you must know, — it came 
to a bitter pass with us, and I thought — yes, I really con- 
sidered whether I could not shelter me and mine beneath 
your kindliness, whether I could not take all and give back 
just a little" — Her voice sharpens with the conscious- 
ness of bitter shame. 

" You thought — even then " — He draws a long breath. 
" Regina, you could not have lived with a man who loved 
you and not have loved him in return. You are too honest. 
And oh, my darling ! if you had made one little sign ! " 

" It was not love," she cries with sharp assertiveness. 

'' But — you liked me." 

" I liked you. But I was weak and narrow. I looked 
at your life, not at you. I had plans, ambitions. I thought 
I could reach great heights. I have done — nothing," she 
confesses despairingly. 

"My child," he says caressingly, "it is something to 
arrive at that knowledge even. But you have been labor- 
ing at the wrong things. See, you have come back to the 
need of all womanly lives — love. You have a sweet, and 



 

noble, and gracious womanhood. Tt can be put to better 
uses than scrubbing Hoors. Why should you not have had 
ambitions ! And see, Regina, how blind, how even cowardly 
I was a year ago. I ottered you the wealth j'ou had been 
deprived of then. I should have made a fight for love pure 
and simple. I should have discerned the royal road to your 
heart." 

" You thought I hated poverty ! Yes, I did. I shall 
never love its straits and sacrifices and small economies. 
But I could take them up unflinchingly now. I have 
acquired some wisdom, some of the truer grace." 

" My darling," he says with infinite sweetness, " there 
are fl.owers that can only reach their best in hothouses 
with care, and shelter, and tenderness. We prate, of the 
little wood violet with no sweetness, but we take to our 
inmost souls her beautiful, fragrant sister, evolved with 
much pains and delicate care, who gives a grateful reward 
for it all. Is it weak to appreciate all the finer grace that 
ease, and culture, and wealth can give ? If it is a man's 
birthright to be strong, to wrest from the earth her treas- 
ures, cannot some women comprehend in their natures the 
glow and sparkle of the diamond that he is proud to put 
in a rare setting ?" 

" But you — yes, you rate me too highly," she replies in 
her strenuous insistence. " I have not been honest. I 
think now that I sheltered myself behind Jasper Bradley 
lest you might come too near. I was afraid " — 

" Ah, you half loved me thenr You see, a man blunders 
as well. Why, I was too fearful." 

" He asked me to marry him." 

Winterburne gives his soft, delightful laugh. 

" And you could not. At first I was troubled, perhaps 
jealous, afraid lest he represented to you sOme needs of 
your soul of which I was ignorant. Then I felt certain you 
would see." 

" When I found some of these most exquisite qualities 
had no root, no real growth, I could not help applying the 
test to myself. And I discovered that mine had no large 





and vital grace, none of that broad comprehension. I was 
ashamed of the indigence of my own soul. Cynthia is a 
better, a more courageous woman." 

" But it is you I love. See," he says, " I once offered to 
give up some of my plans and aims for your sake. Now, I 
ask you to come and help me wherever you can. Then 
I would have set you up on a pedestal and worshipped you ; 
now I say let us worship together the one true God, and 
serve Him in whatever we may best do for humanity. Ten 
years from this time I shall be a comparatively rich man. 
Can you not add such delight to the uses of wealth that 
others shall not so much envy but be glad that we had it ? " 

" You think I can help you " — she falters. 

He stops and kisses her protesting, questioning lips 
under the silence of the eternal stars. 

" My dear Regina, you want to take life too hard. You 
want to do penance for all your poor little sins and mis- 
takes. Humanity is making them continually. A wise 
man said, ' Let the dead bury their dead.' Let the old 
mistakes go with the past. There will be enough in the 
new life without wresting these from their graves. I am 
no hero. I dare say I shall try your patience often. Come, 
now having confessed so many things, make one more sweet 
confession. Tell me that you love me. You have not said 
it yet." 

"I — I do not know," she cries piteously, and yet she 
clings to him with a new tenderness. " It is all so strange. 
And I have not a quick, responsive nature " — 

" You have been among your gods of stone, up in your 
serene heaven, questioning the stars for so long, that you 
have almost forgotten human needs. And I am very 
human. If last night, and there was one dread instant, — 
I had gone out of life " — 

" Oh, I cannot bear it ! " she cries. " If you had gone, — 
I should have been true always to the one man who loved 
me ; " and she lets herself be borne on by a sudden rush of 
sweet, new emotion that fills her soul with mysterious pain. 

'• Will you be less tender to the living man who loves 
you ? " he asks with infinite entreaty. 



 

" Oh, are you quite sure ? If there were some nobler 
woman ? " For she has an awful misgiving that she is 
deh'tiudiiig Cynthia. 

" You are set in a circle of scruples," he says, amused 
and yet a little hurt. " I told you onoe I was your loyal 
lover. I shall remain so to my life's end. Whether you 
take me or put me by, there will be no other woman." 

Cynthia has divined this with her clear insight. They 
will always be comrades on parallel lines. 

"Forgive me," she entreats. Then, while her face is 
scarlet in the dusk where even the stars may not see, she 
cries with one impassioned breath, " I take you." 

But he can divine by some sure intuition that even the 
stars may not see, that love flings out its flag of surrender. 

Neither does Regina Halford sleep this night. She ceases 
to protest, she is simply passive. The happiness is so new 
that she feels there should be some process of training her 
soul to apprehend its sacredness. She is so ignorant, so 
uncomprehending. All her old ideals have been swept 
away, and the new are formless but not void. 

Winterburne has one delightfully indolent day. Mrs. 
Sayre comes and takes out Perdita, Mrs. Halford retires to 
her own room and dozes. The story tells itself by the 
indescribable mystery hovering about Regina, who cannot 
dress her bliss in common words. 

On the" following morning he goes down to Warwick. 
Mr. Farrand is dead. His almost half-century of service 
is ended. There will be an infusion of fresh, younger life 
presently and newer methods. For the rest, the town 
looks greatly improved. There are plans for new houses, 
for straightening the streets, and certain sanitary regula- 
tions that should have been enforced long ago. Now that 
death has entered many homes, and there have been weeks 
of such terrible anxiety and anguish, people are quite ready 
to listen. 

Winterburne insists that Armitage shall take his vacation. 
He is very much worn, but has manfully done his duty. 
He is delighted with the prospect of joining the two women 





who have luade life larger to hiin in the rich companionsliip 
of mutual experience. He has aiiqulred a more intelligent 
perception of the need of human souls, through this year's 
experience. 

The hearing of the will is postponed twice to give Jasper 
Bradley an opportunity to appear. His lawyer has sent 
repeatedly to the address given, only to learn at last that 
the person in question had disappeared, leaving no clew, 
and he is rather disgusted at the prospect of losing a large 
fee. The evidence is sufficient, though it is known there 
is some other quite as convincing. The court declares the 
will invalid, and orders the former division to be made. 
There are just two shares. But Perdita is not seriously 
concerned. She has her beloved violin, and dreams in secret 
of some day trying her chances with the great world. When 
they are all married, they will not care so much. 

The trial has been sufBcient excuse for Winterburne to 
spend some weeks in Beverly, even if a change were not 
necessary. He comes up every night. Oh, how lovely the 
old town is in its immeasurable quiet ! Perhaps he will 
not wait until extreme old age to settle here. He has a 
fancy there may be two homes. Indeed, he plans one a 
little different from his first dream, to be sure, with large 
grounds and commodious rooms where some of the lessons 
of social equality may be taught in a kindly fashion. 

There is a noticeable falling-off in the saloons.' Men are 
beginning to be interested in other projects. Braxton, too, 
is not without influence among his compeers, obstinate old- 
country people, but not lacking in a certain kind of shrewd- 
ness. His escape from a terrible death sobered him com- 
pletely; and the knowledge that his employer, the youngest 
and most fortunate of the three partners, should have risked 
his life, touched all his springs of gratitude. 

The Braxtons had indeed suffered severely. Of the nine 
children the baby, a pretty, flaxen-haired little thing, had 
gone first. This had been followed by several weeks' illness 
on the part of the mother, when the eldest son, a fine, sturdy 
lad of a dozen years, sickened and died. Through it all, the
