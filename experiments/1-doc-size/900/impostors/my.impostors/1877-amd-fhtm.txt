manner. Tlieo sat there, elegant, stately, reserved. Ido 
believe aunt Clara admired her very much. 

Mr. Ross remained to dinner, spent the evening, went 
to a hotel and staid all night, and devoted the next day 
to us. He had resolved to win Theo. He showed his 
love, not obtrusively, but with the indefinable little touches 
of old-world politeness. 

“ I have made him a promise,*’ said Theo when he was 
gone, “ or I do not know but he might have staid for- 
ever. I am to be engaged for a month, and to try to 
like him. Then, if I can’t, he will relinquish me to my 
own old-maid devices.” 

There was a weary look in her face, that I did not Hke. 
I noticed, too, that she wore the ring. 

“ Oh! ” said Rose, espying it. “An opal is very un- 
lucky. Did you not know that? I should be afraid the 
engagement might — well, be broken, you know. And I 
would not have taken any thing less than a solitaire 
diamond.” 

“Well, I rather like an opal,” returned Theo: “it is 
so different from the stereotyped diamonds and pearls.” 

Rose confided to me, that Mr. Ross “looked lik e a 
hero out of a book, and was awfully fond of Theo ; but 
she thought him something of a stick.” 

Our stay drew to a close. Some other visitors were to 
replace us. 

“We shall go on a little jaunt early in September, but 
return home by the middle of the month, I think. You 
and Theo must come and make us a \dsit,” said aunt 
Clara warmly. “ Come over some Friday, if you can do 
no better, and remain until Monday morning.” 

Then we kissed good-by, and set out for North wood. 
It had been a gala time, — carriage-riding every day, din- 
ners, parties in the evening, and two hops, all the glo- 
ries of West Point right at our elbow. 

How delightful it was to have an abundance of this 





world’s goods ! Why couldn’t papa have been prospered, 
I used to ask. He was so kind, so honest, and upright, 
using his little money and position so wisely ! And it 
really seemed as if uncle Robert, pleasant as he was, did 
not care for much beside his own advancement. 

It would soon be time for school again. A bit of good 
fortune befell me in this respect. A ne-w grammar school 
had been built in our part of the city, and I had applied 
for a position. I learned that I had been appointed, with 
a salary of four hundred. I should save considerable in 
car-fare. 

Out of our five hundred dollars, papa had spent nearly 
a hundred in his journeying ; and two hundred had been 
laid by for interest, taxes, and insurance. Six months’ 
household expenses had come out of the other. Mother 
had managed Tvonderfully, on twenty-five dollars a month. 
Our coal was put in ; but she had only paid little more 
than half the bill, and we had just twenty dollars to begin 
September with. Our winter vegetables and butter were 
provided for, as father had taken them in exchange for 
labor. Were we coming to absolute poverty? 

Eight dollars a week, — how large it looked to me ! 
We would not starve, anyhow. I could stand in the 
'breach. 



“ Shall I enforce thy love ? I could. Shall I entreat thy love ? I 

will.” — Love’s Labor Lost. 

“I AM not going to school any more,’ announced 
Della the very last day of vacation. I shall be sixteen 
in three months. And, mother and Chris, — if you would 
but consent to my plans ! ” 

We both glanced up at our third daughter. She was 
quite tall, a fair, nice-looking girl, but not with Theo’s 
bewitching prettiness. 

“You know I spent the day with Mrs. Palmer last 
week? ” 

“Yes.” I can guess what is coming ; but mother looks 
puzzled. 

“We talked it over. I am not much of a student. I 
could enter the high school ; but there would be three or 
four years : and all this time I must be clothed, without 
earning a penny. Mrs. Palmer said she would take me in 
the store and teach me millinery, and I could do fancy- 
work. She will pay me three dollars a week all winter, 
and give me four next spring. Her niece has gone to 
Philadelphia as a hospital nurse, you know. I think it’s 
just a fortunate chance : I must do something.” 

“And I?” says Theo, springing up from the sofa, and 
uttering a strange, pathetic cry, — “am I never to do 
any thing but just hang, a millstone round every one’s 
neck ? ’ ’ 


 



“ O Theo ! ” That is mamma’s soft, deprecating voice, 
expressing so much ! 

“You are so good at home, Theo ! ” replies Dell, in a 
patronizing way that is rather funny from the little girl in 
the family. “You can cook and sew and — I’m sure 
you are never idle. But I like business. And we all think 
Mrs. Palmer so nice ! ” 

It was true enough. Mrs. Palmer was a “ war widow,” 
had been one of the earliest. With her little money she 
had opened a store, as her young girl business had been 
milUnery. She did a good deal of elegant fancy-work, 
and machine-sewing beside, and had gained quite a posi- 
tion already. 

Dell had firmly made up her mind. We offered a little 
w’eak opposition at first, then consented. She would 
have to join the army of workers. AYe could afford to 
keep only one girl at home. 

Mother went to see Mrs. Palmer, and the bargain was 
concluded. She was very fond of Dell. 

Father returned, looking quite well, and really hand- 
some. If he could only find emplo}Tuent ! He tried for 
a fortnight, and then took some collecting. 

I lilied my new school very much. Being near home, it 
gave me more time. 

We discussed the project of going on a farm. Father 
had an opportunity to trade the house for a small farm ; 
and it seemed now, as prices were going higher all the 
time, that farming would really pay. 

Our house was considered "worth five thousand. 
Whether it would bring that in these depressed times was 
a question. The country-house was old, considerably out 
of repair, two-story, with eight rooms, no furnace, no 
gas, no paved walks, but an abundance of fruit and a 
shackly old barn. 

“ A woman’s farm-work is pretty hard,” said mother. 
“ AYe should keep one or two cows, and there would be 


 


milking night and morning, churning, poultry" to care for, 
and a good deal of gardening. Chrissie could not teach 
there, and could she earn four hundred dollars? Then 
Dell would have to help me, and must have her clothes 
somehow. I don’t believe we should make as much actu- 
al money, and we would not have as many comforts. To 
be sure, there would be the long delightful summers in the 
country.” 

“ I do not believe it would be practicable,” confessed 
papa with a sigh. 

We girls decided that we did not want to go. 

“ And, when Archie comes home, he can help a little,” 
said mother brightly. “We wdll economize; and you 
must not go into any very hard work until you are quite 
strong again. 

Mr. Sargent was married, and brought his wife to 
Northwood. Miss Wilbur pronounced her an elegant and 
superior woman. I took some pains to keep out of their 
way. For a while they boarded at the Mansion House, 
as our best family hotel was called. 

Meanwhile what of Theo and Mr. Ross? He still came. 
Sometimes Theo wore her ring, but she was oftener with- 
out. Now and then she broke out into a tempest of gayety 
and flirtation, then she was demure as a nun. Mr. Ross 
was so patient, so generous, that I began to feel sorry for 
him when Theo was in her wilful moods. One evening he 
tried to restrain her a little, and incidental referred to 
something he could or would do, with an air of authority. 

‘ ‘ I will tell you what you can do ; ” and Theo gave a 
light, bitter laugh. “You can leave the house, and never 
come into it again. You worry my life out with your love 
and your care, and every thing. It stifles me ; it kills me ! 
A lifetime of it would set me cmzy. Go! ” And she 
stamped her foot, while her eyes fairly blazed. 

He rose slowly, said good-evening in the quietest of 
tones, and went out. 





“There, it is all over! Chris, am I a termagant, a 
sharp, ungrateful vixen? Why do people love and care 
for me? When they stay at a distance, I like them pretty 
well : when they come near — well, sometimes I hate them ; 
yes, I really do. Was there ever an instance, think, of 
one being born an old maid from the very beginning ? I 
must have been, I believe. But isn’t it queer how quick 
he took it, how he marched olf in high disdain I Was he 
very angry, I wonder? ” And her voice began to fall a 
little from its shrill key, and take on a tremulous quiver. 
“ Do you suppose he loves me very much Chris? I hope 
not. If he only would take to some one else ! ” 

Then she threw herself on the sofa, buried her face in 
the pillow, and sobbed softly

‘ ‘ O Theo ! ’ ’ Could I comfort her ? Did she love him ? 
“ I am glad it is all at an end,” she began presently. 
“ I shall never have another lover, Chris, never. And 
now I am going to turn over a new leaf. I mean to prac- 
tise my music, and see if I cannot get a few scholars. 
The discipline will be good, and the money will be better. 
I can’t consent to be the only drone in the hive, when you 
and Della are working so industriously.” 

“ Why, you do work,” I replied energetically. “ See 
what you save me in hats and dresses, and how much 
you help mother ! One pair of hands could not do all the 
work of this family.” 

“ I am glad you think me of some use, Chris. If I 
should — well,” with a kind of hysterical laugh, — “if 
I should marry, and go away with some one, I hope you 
would miss me a little. I should like to think that some 
one said, ‘ Dear Theo’s fingers did this or that, or she 
said thus and so.’ I cannot bear the idea of being quite 
forgotten. I wonder if an}- one would ever be foolish 
enough to — to kiss a little ribbon, for instance, that some 
other body had worn, and tied in a cunning little bow, 
or to read over the poems one had loved, when that one 
was miles and miles away? ” 


 


“ How queer you are talking, Theo, for a girl who 
does not intend to marry ! 

“ Oh, yes ! ” in a kind of absent way, her eyes seeming 
to look into the future. ‘‘ I am queer and flighty. Next 
thing I’ll be having spells, like Mrs. Sandborn.” 

Mrs. Sandborn still indulged in her periodical “mys- 
teries.” Mr. Sandborn had been drafted, and did really 
want to go to war : indeed, would have enlisted at first, 
if she had not “gone on” so terribly. When she heard 
of the result of the draft, she just passed from one swoon 
to another, called in the neighbors and several doctors, 
and lay at the point of death, until her husband promised 
to get a substitute. Having no ready money, he was 
compelled to mortgage his house ; but his whole heart 
went out to the brave men who were struggling for their 
country’s weal. 

Afterward I came to know that it was not the chanse 
and absence of marriage that was in Theo’s mind this 
evening. 

“ The best thing, Theo, is to go to bed, and get a little 
tranquillized,” I replied: so we shut up the parlor, and 
betook ourselves to our room. 

Why was Theo so different from most girls? for she 
was, as I well understood. I began to envy real com- 
monplace people, and wish somehow that she — no, I 
didn’t want her changed, either. If only — ah, how 
much of anxious desire those two words may comprehend ! 

We went to bed. I was healthily and unromantically 
sleepy. Theo lay very quiet, save that I could hear her 
heart beat, as if it were under my very pillow. 

“What is the matter, dear?” I asked presently. 
“ Are you unhappy? ” 

“My darling!” She turned, and kissed me in the 
dark. “ No, I am not unhappy. I ought to have some 
compunctions of conscience ; ” and she gives the old, gay, 
mischievous laugh, by which I knew her sweet temper is 





quite restored. “But if one could learn in some way, 
Chris, just what God meant to have one do. It puzzles 
me so. There must be some design in it all. When so 
many things point in one direction, it seems as if the way 
was plain ; but is it the right way? Can one judge simply 
from the personal desire ? Some one said ‘ Duty was the 
thing that you did not want to do, but that was put 
straight in your way.’ Is it, I wonder? ” 

“ I do not think it means marriage, Theo.” 

“Yet how many women would, if they had listened to 
the promptings of their hearts, have married unworthily 
and wrongly ! You pray to be shown a way, and, if one 
opens before you, how decide that it is of God? ” 

“I do not know how we can be sure.” 

I said this solemnly, and in no cavilling frame of mind. 
Is it that the mistakes are given to us also, not that we 
went into them by fault, or shortsightedness, but that the 
discipline was simply the living out of them ? 

“ Pray that I may be right, Chris. The rest I shall 
not trouble about.” 

“ You were right, Theo, to give him up. I do not 
believe you would have been really happy with him.” 

She was not looking at it in this view ; but I did not 
know then. 

Is there some fatal strength in circumstances ? and must 
one go on straight in the path of destiny ? These questions 
confuse and stagger me. 

We were at dinner the next day, when aunt Hetty came 
in. Some friend of hers, quite out in the suburbs, had 
been buried that morning ; “ and though she could just as 
well have ridden clear home in the coach,” she thought 
she would stop. “We girls had grown so grand since 
uncle Robert’s folks had taken us to West Point, that 
we didn’t notice plain people lilce her. We couldn’t drop 
in and be sociable any more.” 

“We have been very busy,” answered Theo and 
now Chrissie’s school doesn’t take her down town.” 


 


“And now you’re getting a large salar}*, Chrissie. 
Uncle read it in the paper. You can lay up two hundred 
dollars a year, at least. I never spent even two hundred 
a year, when I was a girl.” 

‘ ‘ Everything has changed so much since we were 
girls, Hetty!” said mother mildl}\ “Chrissie does a 
good deal in the family Since father’s sickness, she has 
been a great help to me; had to take Archie’s place, in 
fact. And, being in school every day, she must look 
trim and tidy. Dress-goods are very high, too : so she 
doesn’t expect to lay up a fortune.” 

“Why, I've given three and six a yard for a print 
dress when I was young, and now they are twenty and 
twenty-five cents ; and a dollar a yard for ribbon to go 
on my hat, but it lasted two summers, and then I had it 
dipped for winter : and you wouldn’t believe the wear I 
liad out of that ribbon. I remember taking the last of it 
to line a muff. But then w"e kept our clothes nice, and 
didn’t expect to put ’em on, every tack and turn.” 

“ Country and city life are quite different, as well as 
the times.” 

“ I don’t know what we will come to if the war doesn’t 
end. And Robert’s making lots of money, I hear. Some 
people a?*e lucky. — O Theo ! ” veering round suddenly, 
“ I heard you had a beau. Miss Giddings told Martha. 
A real splendid fellow, she said, boarding at the Hudsons, 
and that Miss Hudson would give her two eyes for him. 
I always said to uncle you wasn’t made so good-looking 
for nothing. Now, I hope you’ll have a little common 
sense, and not fly right in the face of Providence, as Chris 
did. I declare, I can’t get over it ! She might just as 
well have had a nice house of her own, and been in the 
Miller family. Not but what Martha likes her new sister- 
in-law well enough ; and she isn’t so dreadfully stuck up 
as one would expect, but not much of a beauty. I do 
want W see some of these girls married. What will your 
mother do with three old maids ? ’ ’ 





“ The same as I did with three little girls,” answered 
mother with a smile. 

I went off to school, and left aunt Hetty talking. 
When I came home, Theo had gone out to do some errands 
and to see a sick friend. It blew up rather cloudy and 
gusty in the evening ; and suddenly there was a downpour 
of rain. 

“ I do hope Theo is safe,” said mother. 

She came in presently with an attendant, whom she 
ushered into the parlor. The door happened to be shut 
between : so I did not catch the voice. I went up to my 
room to answer a few notes that lay heavy on my con- 
science. One was from Georgie Curtis, now married, 
with the best and dearest husband and the sweetest baby. 
If ever I married, — was she doubtful? — she hoped I 
would find such a husband. I had no idea what true 
happiness was ; and so on, ad nauseam. Mr. Danforth at 
the beginning of the war had raised a regiment, and 
offered it to his country. He had been wounded once, but 
was now back again ; and Mrs. Danforth had done some 
army nursing. 

Theo ran up stairs about half-past nine. She had a 
curious, fiushed, dazzling look in her face, as she came 
and stood directly before me. Was it the radiance of 
happiness ? 

Then she holds out her hand. There is Mr. Ross’s 
opal ring encircling her finger. 

“ O Theo! ” 

My head is in a whirl. There is a sudden sensation 
that one has in taking ether. I feel as if I were going 
backwards, down some endless precipice. 

“Yes. It is all settled. We are regularly engaged. 
There is to be no more quarrelling, no more flu'ting, no 
more — any thing. The world has come to an end.” Is 
that awesome tone really hers ? 

“ But — Theo.” I know my eyes revolve wildly. 


 


‘ ‘ I think it was to be — one of those things marked out 
from the beginning. For two daj's I tried to go to poor 
Saidie Weston’s ; but something prevented. Yesterday 
she had a weak spell, and couldn’t have seen any one for 
ten minutes : to-day she insisted on my taking tea with her 
in her room. We had quite a gay little feast. I said 
good-by, and started. There was a slight sprinkle blow- 
ing out of the clouds. I ran down to the corner, and saw 
the car going up the street. I hate standing on the cor- 
ners at night : so I stepped into the drug-store to wait my 
ten minutes. Half of it had gone, when the door opened, 
and Mr. Ross entered. It gave me such a curious feeling, 
Chris ! My arms dropped at my side, with the sensation 
of a prisoner who surrenders. Yet we did not speak. 
When the car came up, it was pouring like a deluge. He 
held his umbrella over me, stepped into the car, paid fare 
for two with the deliberation of happier times, stopped at 
the right place, and escorted me to my own roof-tree dry 
and safe. All this time I was thinking of my shameful 
behavior of last night. I did act like a fiend or a fish- 
woman. No, I wasn’t profane : so the fiend will do. I 
was very thoroughly ashamed, and felt that I never 
should respect myself until I had apologized. I’m not a 
moral coward, if I have a quick temper. So I said my 
little say ; and he asked if he might not come in and talk 
it all over. I must have dreamed it before, Chris ; for I 
knew just how every thing was going to happen, and it 
made no difference whether I promised to marry liim now, 
or six months hence. I could not run away from destiny. 
Fate had caught me, and held me in a tight clutch. When 
he was all through, I tested his affection by two questions ; 
and they were both answered satisfactorily. I think he 
loves me with his whole heart and soul.” 

“But you!” I cry, — “are not your wishes to be 
taken into account ? ’ ’ 

“ Chrissie, I do believe I love him as weU as I shall 





ever love any one. He has some of the ways I like. He 
is clean and neat as a pin, — think of having a slovenly 
man around! — he does not even smoke; is temperate, 
frugal, industrious ; and, O Chris ! so deliciously kind. 
If I were going to be sick a long while, I would not ask 
a better nurse. I am not romantic or sentimental : I 
cannot get up to glowing heights. Marriage seems quite 
an every-day business, after all. You really do have to 
think where you will live afterwards, and how much you 
can afford to spend a week. The engagement is to be 
brief. If everybody consents, we shall be married this 
fall.” Her voice breaks off sharp and cold. 

“ O Theo I it can’t be. We never were so poor in all 
our lives. What will you do for wedding- clothes ? ” 

“ Well, I don’t know. Providence, who seems to have 
brought this about, will show us a way ; or if there is no 
way, why, then it cannot be done ; that is all. And now I 
believe I will go to bed : I’m deadly tired.” 

“ Tell me one thing first. Are you very happy? ” 

I look into her eyes, as the angel may look at the day 
of judgment. They do not droop, nor stare, nor laugh 
with that mirthful mischief, but are solemn, and holding 
something in their far depths that I cannot see. 

“ O God ! ” I pray with a swift breath, “if it is not 
right, do not let this thing happen.” 

It is so strange for the next two or three days ! 
Father and mother talk it over. Theo hunts up the let- 
ters of recommendation that have never been used, and 
begs father to write. Mr. Ross has made no secret of 
his standing, or his friends in the old country. They are 
plain working-people, the brothers doing business in a 
small way, the mother able to spell correctly, and write a 
very nice letter to her son. The sister’s husband in Aus- 
tralia is getting rich. 

“ I wonder if you will ever go back to England,” says 
Theo, one evening. 


 


“I” — and he starts with a sudden flush. “Would 
you like to go ? ” 

“ I think — yes, I do believe I should,” nodding her 
head gayly, — “ if I were not seasick.” 

“No doubt we shall go some time,” he replies quietly 

The answers come to the letters. The gentlemen in 
Philadelphia in whose employ Mr. Ross spent four years 
found him a steady, honest, faithful man. He had no 
bad habits or bad associates. At one time they had 
talked of taking him into business. But reverses followed, 
and they were compelled to make an entire change. So 
with the other epistle. He spent his first year in Brook- 
lyn, and goes there occasional!y ; but it is not likely that 
twelve months has in it any thing to change a person’s 
opinion. He was so young when he came, — only twenty- 
three, — and has not broken with or forgotten his family. 

“A faultless monster!” laughs Theo. “Even his 
washerwoman declares that he is a gentleman ; for he 
once overpaid her, and wouldn’t take it back. If he were 
only worth a million now ! Is that to be classed as a 
fault, or misfortune? ” 

“ Theo, I don’t like to hear you talk in that way,” says 
mother in a soft, chiding voice. “ One need not be 
ashamed of honest poverty.” 

“ My dear mamma, poverty is, like some of the other 
valuable \drtues, heroic in talk, but quite commonplace 
in daily experience. We can admire the beggar dividing 
his crust ; but there is nothing poetical in hunting up the 
cheapest butcher, or making over old dresses, or even 
warming up yesterday’s dinner. Yet such things are 
done, and we still live.” 

So we settle to Theo’s engagement without any fuss. 
She has decided to board home until spring. 

“ Mrs. Hudson will board us for ten dollars a week, if 
I look after my own room,” says Theo in a severely 
practical tone. “Now, this will be something in our 





family income. Onr washing will be from one to two dol- 
lars a week ; and that will serve to pay our woman. Then 
father will not feel so troubled and anxious. And Chris, 
you old dear, you will not be compelled to supply" me 
with pocket-money. I shouldn’t wonder if I treated you 
to a car-ride now and then, or a plate of cream.” 

In truth, there was the utmost need of considering. 
During the four weeks father had been collecting, and 
canvassing for advertisements, he had made just thirt}- 
two dollars. Would times ever come good, we wondered. 
Once he said he had half a mind to enlist for the sake of 
the bounty. I do beheve, if he had been well and strong, 
he would have gone. 

Everybody economized — except army contractors. 
Their families flaunted in diamonds and velvet, while the 
wives and children of some of the poor soldiers almost 
starved, on their miserable pittance for tent-making, and 
various other employments. 

Archie kept well, and had been promoted for meritori- 
ous conduct. It wasn’t much, to be sm’e, and he had been 
proud of doing- his duty as a private. 


CHAPTER XIV. 


We had a note from aunt Clara, sa}ing Rose was to be 
married the last of October. It would be a grand private 
wedding. Wouldn’t Theo and I be sure to come? 

We had been down one Saturday to lunch and dinner, 
and had a lovely drive in the park. Could we not come 
down again? This particular Saturday there would be 
some friends in to luncheon, and she thought we would 
have a pleasant time. 

Dressed in our very best, we went. Uncle Robert’s 
new house was handsome and commodious, and beautifully 
furnished. Rose was in a wild flutter, and must show 
and explain. 

“ It will be a gaslight wedding at eleven, a.m., precisely. 
Just the bridesmaid. Van’s cousin : he has no end of them. 
We are to stand here,” — designating the lower end of 
the parlor. “ It is all to be draped with lace and flowers, 
like a little temple. Then the family — there’s a fearful 
raft of the Van Korts, and I have relations on the Dins- 
more and Burtis side. But mamma thought we ought to 
compliment the Durants, and I really did want you two. 
Theo must be dressed in white, over some tint. You 
ought to have a pretty silk. At half-past eleven we are 
to sit down to the wedding-breakfast ; and at two I must 
be down to the steamer. Miss Eliza Van Kort is going 

over with us, — another of the cousins, quite an old maid. 

 


Most of my trousseau is to be bought in Paris, duties 
are so fearfully high now ! Then I think shopping will be 
ever so much more fun. Just tliink of running about in 
the Rue This or That, and buying every thing you want. 
Won’t it be splendid? ” 

She paused to draw breath. For a moment I was 
tempted to envy her. 

Then we listened to a description of the wedding-dress, 
— white satin and point lace, veil and orange-flowers. 
Here were her diamonds, — a present from old Mr. Van 
Kort. She should wear the ear-rings, the necklace, and 
bracelets, when she was married. Mother didn’t want her 
to, but Van did ; and she was resolved to look “ perfectly" 
gorgeous.” Here were a few gifts ; but they hadn’t begun 
to come in yet. She hoped she would have oceans of 
them, and ever so many in pretty things that she could 
wear. 

An hour on this subject was rather tiresome. I hailed 
the advent of the lunch-party. A voice sounded in the 
hall. I knew it in a moment, — Miss Molhe Henderson, 
the irrepressible, more shaken together than ever, but this 
time in a brown silk. Mrs. Rutherford, — and she I found 
had been the senior Miss Henderson, and the victim of 
an unfortunate marriage. She resembled her handsome 
brother, and had an air of languor and reflnement that 
was quite captivating. I learned afterward that she was 
the singer. There was a younger one they called Percy. 

‘ ‘ There are flve girls in all ; but we never go out more 
than three strong. I don’t suppose any of us will ever get 
married; ” and Miss Mollie made a little moue though 
her voice was hearty and good-humored. “Portia made 
such a fiasco — married ow, instead of off ; and Heaven 
knows we have enough to do to take care of ourselves. 
Thank fortune that Jack Rutherford went to war. If he 
only could go straight to glory ! ” 

‘ ‘ But what was the matter ? ’ ’ Then I blushed at 

jseeming so impertinent. 


 


“ Oh ! he was a gay young fellow, who had a tolerably 
rich mother. Between ns both, I think she wanted to get 
him olf her hands. She was immensely sweet on Portia 
until it was all over. It is just six years ago, and Portia 
was nineteen. Well, he drank and gambled, and was 
maudlin generally ; and finally she shipped him, and he 
went to war. She has a lovely little daughter, though, 
and that’s six of us females ; only she’ll be Miss Ruther- 
ford.” 

“ What is Percy’s name? ” 

“Oh! Persephone. I have the only sensible name in 
the family ; but I was named after grandmother Fairfax, 
and she was always called Mollie. There’s Portia and 
Persephone and Josepha and Adrienne. O Miss Du- 
rant, I wish you would come and see us ! We do have 
real good times, though we cannot aspire to point and 
diamonds. Are you fond of pictures? We have some 
good ones, and, oh ! loads of photographs of everybody. 
And mother has such lots of odd things ! Are you inter- 
ested in the Emperor Napoleon and Josephine? Mother 
will talk you deaf, dumb, and blind on the subject. She 
is writing a book : in fact, we are all writing books.” 

Van, Mr. Henderson, and a Mr. March comprised the 
gentlemen of the party ; and there was another young 
lady, who rarely spoke. The rest were gay enough, 
however. The luncheon was hke a feast ; and we were 
waited upon by a very stylish young colored lad, who had 
been in some great family. 

We sat at the table for nearly two hours, laughing and 
talking. Mollie Henderson and I fell into quite a friend- 
ship. She was proud of being connected with a daily 
paper, and had an ambition to achieve some literary 
distinction. Her book was to be sketches of character, — 
sharp, clever things, jolly, yet satirical. 

When we went to the drawing-room, Mrs. Rutherford 
sang. She did have a beautiful voice. I could have 





listened for hours. But they had to go ; and then we came 
back to wedding-finery, and what “Van and I” meant 
to do in Paris. It proved very tiresome at length. 

Blanche was at school : so we could not have her for a 
contrast. The younger children were kept in the nursery. 

Dinner was at six. Then uncle Robert took us down 
to the ferry in the carriage, escorted us over, and put us 
in the cars. 

“ Theo,” I said, “ whatever can we do for dresses? ” 

“ I’ll consider the point. Don’t fi'et your careful soul 
until there is need.” 

Somehow it seemed real nice to get to our own quiet, 
tidy home, and hear mother’s soft voice after all the
hubbub. 

During the week and a half that followed, Theo’s aflain 
were decided. Mr. Ross petitioned for a marriage early 
in December : why should they go on waiting ? 

“I shall be glad to have it over,” declared Theo; 
“ then we can settle down to regular living. I am going 
to stay at home six months, and I can do most of my 
sewing afterward.” 

“ Chris,” mother said one evening as we sat alone, “I 
have been thinking of Theo’s marriage. She, poor dear 
girl, would go to church in a calico gown with the utmost 
content. I am sorry that a wedding should come in just 
at this time, when we are so poor ; yet I do not see any 
immediate prospect of being richer. And now I have a 
plan to propose. I hope you will feel like consenting ; ” 
and she sighed softly. 

“ Of course I shall,” I returned eagerly. 

“It is this. Della, you know, has not had her watch 
yet. The money was put in the bank when grandmother 
died ; and with the interest, and a trifle I have added, it is 
one hundred and fifty dollars. I want to use it for Theo’s 
outfit. Will you help me make it up again when times 
get a little better? It is a good deal to ask, when you 
are always doing so much.” 


 


‘‘ O mamma, gladly!” and I kissed the hesitating, 
quivering lips. “ You see it will not be so bad when 
Theo is really married. And father may find some open- 
ing. Then, if I did not repay it until next year, it would 
do.” 

“ I am so thankful to have you agree with me in this 
matter. And now you must help me manage, and think 
a little for me. Make out a list of outside garments that 
she ought to have ; above all things, don’t say a word to 
her.” 

So I had my secret. 

“ Come up stairs, and view the wedding-clothes,” said 
Theo, the Monday before the grand affair. 

I marched up to the spare room. I knew Theo was 
very busy ; but I had been bidden to ask no questions. 

There, on the spare-room bed, lay two dresses : one 
was a beautiful puffy tarlatan, made over what seemed a 
blossom-colored silk, with pale pinlv bows here and there, 
a pretty, low body, or corsage, and a dainty fichu full of 
delicate frills.” 

“O Theo! where did you get it?” I exclaimed. I 
had given her ten dollars, all I could spai’e ; and no silk 
garment could come out of that, I well knew. 

“Now look at yours.” 

Black lace made over white, the ribbons and garniture 
a soft bright blue. 

“ You are a marvel or a wdtch ; repeat the incantation. 
I know this black lace flounce is the border of mother’s 
mantle.” 

“ And the top of the skirt is yours. Then I happened 
to find this figured lace in a store ; and, as it was old-fash- 
ioned, I bought it cheap. It was just what I wanted. 
The foundation of your dress is your white alpaca. It 
wasn’t much work you see ; only to trim it over.” 

What dainty, pretty bows ! What airy, fluffy puffs ! 
What taste and elegance altogether ! 





“ Now let me put on mine.” 

It was almost like Cinderella attiiing herself for the 
ball. 

“ But I don’t understand this pink, I don’t know what 
to call it.” And I know I looked puzzled. 

She laughed gayly. 

“ Why, it looks like silk ; doesn’t it? ” 

“Yes,” in an incredulous manner. 

“ Feel of it, then.” 

“ Like the woman in Handy Andy, you have had your 
old black silk dyed — pink.” 

“It is fine French silesia, forty cents, and a yard in 
width. It is just elegant.” 

She did look lovely. I had to rush up and kiss her, if 
she was not a bride. 

“lam practising, you see. I expect to get my trous- 
seau out of nothing.” 

I smiled a little then. 

She had bought our gloves. I had a beautiful sash 
just this colored blue ; and she had a white one with em- 
broidered fiowers in the ends. 

I was quite content to go then. All along I had ex- 
pected to give up at the last moment. 

I took a holiday, and we started early. Our box had 
gone on Tuesday by express. We found the house in a
