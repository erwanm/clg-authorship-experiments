we shall be able to have a new parlor carpet in the 
spring.” 

“ I ’ll do all I can to help,’ was Kathie’s delighted 
rejoinder. 




ROB’S GIANTS. 

One day Eob came home with what he declared to 
be a splitting headache. His face was flushed, his 
temples throbbing, and there wasn’t a spot in his 
whole body but what pained. 

“ You must have taken a dreadful cold,” his mother 
said. “ I hope you are not going to be sick.” 

“ Just let me lie down on the lounge and be quiet,” 
was all lie could say. 

She bathed his feet and put on mustard draughts, 
gave him some hot tea, and tied a napkin round his 
head wet with vinegar and water. So there he lay 
turning and tumbling about and wishing he could 
sleep. 

Poor Eob ! By morning his fever was higher, and 
Kathie was sent for the doctor. 

“ A touch of bilious fever,” said Dr. Page. “ He is 
a good deal out of order and has taken a severe 
cold.” 


 


“ But do you think it will prove dangerous ? ” 

“ Oh no. He will be about again in a fortnight.” 

So Mrs. Alston had Rob’s bed brought down to the 
parlor and a fire made there. Aunt Ruth watched 
him during the day, and his mother took care of him 
at night. 

Kathie had a double share of work, — all the er- 
rands to do, coal to bring in, kindling-wood to split, 
and to amuse Fred, who hung after her continually, 
as there was no wonderful Rob to follow about. 

For a week Rob was pretty sick. He didn’t take 
much notice of any one, but tossed about restlessly, 
and wondered if he never should be cool again ; but 
after a while he grew more tranquil, and began to 
think of something to eat. His mother toasted him a 
piece of bread. 

He chewed with very long teeth, as people say 
After two or three mouthfuls he said, slowly, “ Mother,
isn’t this bread a little bitter ? ” 

“No,” she answered; “it is because you are still 
feverish.” 

“ I ’d like a drink of cold tea, I believe.” 

But that didn’t quite come up to the mark either. 
" I wonder if soup wouldn’t be better ? ” 


 


“ Perhaps so. When the butcher comes I ’ll get a 
piece of meat and make you some nice broth.” 

Eob thought of the broth for the next three hours. 
It had such an appetizing fragrance that he was sure 
it would taste good. Alas for his hopes ! 

“ Did you put in any salt ? ” he asked, languidly, 
after he had taken a few spoonfuls. 

“ Yes, it is very well seasoned,” replied his mother. 
It wasn’t quite right, however. 

“ I wish you ’d put in some more,” he said presently. 
Mrs. Alston obeyed his behest. 

“ And some more pepper.” 

“ Pepper isn’t very good, Eob.” 

“ But a little wouldn’t hurt me.” 

Eob was so weak that he felt babyish, and when 
his mother saw the slow tears coming in his eyes 
she yielded against her better judgment. 

He managed to swallow a little, then lie turned to 
his pillow again. 

“ Mother,” he said, just as she was settled at her 
sewing, “ isn’t there some currant jelly ? ” 

“ Yes, Eob.” 

“ Couldn’t I have a taste ? You know I like bread 


and currant jelly so much.” 


 


His mother rose and went to the closet where she 
kept her preserves, uncovered the jar, and took out 
some. 

“ I ’ll just bring you the bread,” she exclaimed, 
“ and you can put it on or eat it alone.” 

She arranged a little tray on the bed and left Rob 
to help himself. 

Though bread and jelly might be royal for a hun- 
gry boy, it held no potent charm for him now. Then 
he tried it alone. That tasted quite good ; but now 
he was taken with a fit of thirst. 

“ Oh mother,” he began, “ don’t you know what nice 
drinks you used to make out of currant jelly and 
water? Won’t you fix me some?” 

Mrs. Alston had sewed about an inch. She waited 
upon her son again. 

“ That ’s real good, the best thing I ’ve had yet ! ” 
His smile, faint though it was, rewarded her. He 
sipped in a pleased fashion, declaring that it looked 
like wine. 

“ Mother,” about ten minutes after, “ don’t you think 
T could sit up a little while ? ” 

“ Why, yes, if you feel like it.” 

“ I believe I do.” 


 


She drew up the large rocking-chair, put a blanket 
over it and a pillow at the back. Then she helped 
Rob to get up, put him comfortably in and covered 
him nicely. 

“ That ’s splendid ! I feel as if my bones were ’most 
worn through. I ’ve been pretty sick ; haven’t I, 
mother ? ” 

“ Quite sick, Rob.” 

“ Any of the boys been to see me ? ” 

“ Oh yes, — Charlie Darrell, Harry Cox, and several 
of the others, and Dick Grayson too ; but you were 
a little delirious most of the time, so you couldn’t 
talk to them.” 

“ Was I ? What did I say ? ” Rob thought that 
quite an exploit. 

“ You built snow-houses, went sledding, played ball 
and marbles, and scolded Freddy.” 

“ Did I ? ” Rob smiled a little at that. “ But, 
mother, you don’t know what a bother Fred is. He 
thinks he must do just as the big boys do, and some- 
times I can’t stir without his being in my way. 
Seems to me little children ought always to play with 
girls.” 

“ Because girls have more patience, Rob ? ” 


 


A faint tinge of color came to Rob’s cheek. 

“ Well, not exactly that, mother, but boys are 


always running or doing something hard, and little 
ones get hurt.” 

“ All children are a good deal of care and trouble.” 

Rob felt quite sure that he wasn’t very much, but 
he began to grow tired of talking and couldn’t argue 
the point. 

“ I wish you ’d get my Robinson Crusoe, mother,” 
he said a few minutes after. 

There was a book-rack in the parlor, and each of 
the children had a shelf. His mother dropped her 
sewing and looked the books over. 

“ It isn’t here, Rob,” she said. 

“ Oh yes, it must be, mother. I always put it there,” 
he exclaimed, confidently. 

“ But it certainly is not here now.” 

“ Oh, I know ; I had it up stairs. It ’s on one of 
my shelves.” 

“ I think it isn’t best for you to read,” was his 
mother’s rejoinder. 

“ I don’t want to read, I only want to look at the 
pictures. It ’s so tiresome to sit here and do nothing.” 
The ready tears came again to Rob’s eyes. 


 


“ And you ’re quite sure it is up stairs ? ” 

“ O yes. I remember taking it one night when I 
went to bed. It had been lent to Jamie Hall.” 

So Mrs. Alston trudged up to Rob’s room. Ho 
Robinson Crusoe on the shelves or in the closet. 
Then she searched his box of odd traps with no 
better success. 

“ How long she stays ! ” he exclaimed, impatiently. 

“ I think you beep her pretty busy, Rob,” said 
Aunt Ruth. “ I don’t believe she has been quiet 
more than fifteen minutes at one time to-day.” 

“ Why, I haven’t asked her to do more than two or 
three things for me, and I ’m sure I’d a great deal 
rather be well and help myself,” replied Rob, in an 
injured tone. 

It would only fret him to argue the point, so Aunt 
Ruth kept the peace. 

Mrs. Alston returned in a little shiver. She had 
not expected to be detained so long, and had thrown 
nothing around her shoulders. Her face looked quite 
cold and blue. 

“ I couldn’t find it anywhere, Rob,” she said, going 
to the fire to warm her hands. 

“ Did you look in my little box ? ” 


 


" Yes, and in the closet. It isn’t in the room." 

“ But, mother, I am quite sure. Jamie brought it 
home. He put a blue paper cover on it, you know ” 

“ I believe I remember the circumstance, but you 
must have lent it again." 

" No, mother, I ’m sure I have n’t." 

“ I do not think it is in the house." 

“ But it must be,” said Rob, growing flushed and 
positive. “ It was my Christmas gift ! Oh dear ! if 
it ’s lost, — and so many splendid pictures in it 
too ! I never saw a Robinson Crusoe I liked half 
as well.” 

“ Maybe it will come to light some time. It can- 
not be lost unless you have mislaid it.” 

“ But I ’m sure I took care of it the last time I 
had it.” 

Katliie entered just then, bright and rosy. “ O, 
Rob, actually sitting up ! ” she exclaimed, gayly. 
“ Dear Rob ! Do you feel a good deal better ? 
But Oh, how white you look ! ” 

“ Oh, Rob ’s out of bed ! ” put in Freddy, loudly. 
“ Rob, are you all well ? Can’t you go out to play 
to-morrow ? ” 

“O Freddy, your voice goes through my head like 


 


ft trumpet. Mother, can’t you put me back to bed 
again ? I ’m getting tired.” 

Mother had just sat down and taken up her 
needle. She rose and obeyed her son’s request. 

“ The bed feels so good,” he exclaimed. “ Freddy, 
do keep still ! ” 

“ Get yourself good and warm, and you may go 
out to play a little while,” his mother said, gently. 

“ Oh Kathie,” began Fob again, “ haven’t you lent 
my Eobinson Crusoe to somebody ? Mother can’t 
find it anywhere. I wouldn’t have it lost for any- 
thing.” 

“ No, Eob, I haven’t had it. Let me see, — Janne 
Hall brought it home ? ” 

“ Yes, I ’m sure. It ’s gone, and some one has 
taken it away. It ’s real mean ! ” and poor Eob was 
getting excited. 

Kathie thought a moment or two. “ O Eob, I 
believe I know. The day you were taken sick you 
had it at school, drawing a picture out of it.” 

Eob looked perfectly amazed. It came over him 
like a flash. He hadn’t quite finished the man 
Friday, so he put the book in the corner of his desk 
He could see it all like a picture, 


 


“ Don’t you remember ? ” and Kathie glanced at 
him. Something in her bright eyes said “ Giants ” ; 
and Rob was filled with confusion. 

“ Yes,’ he rejoined, faintly, and then he lay very still. 

“ Kathie,” her mother said, “ I wish you ’d sew a 
little. I ’m quite behindhand.” 

A tear dropped from Rob’s eyes to the pillow. 
How much trouble and interruption he had caused 
his mother ! That about the book was altogether his 
own fault. How could he have been so careless as 
to forget ! He had worried himself too, for his head 
was beginning to ache, and little pains kept crawling 
down his back. And he couldn’t help thinking 
that he ought to fight giants as well as Kathie. 

“ I must try to remember,” he said to himself. 
There was quite a wet spot on the pillow ; and 
presently he turned his face over to the wall, and, 
being completely tired out, fell asleep. 

He little guessed how much pains they all took 
to keep quiet. Freddy didn’t think it much fun 
to play alone, and soon came in, and Aunt Ruth read 
him a story to keep him still. Kathie sewed indus- 
triously until twilight, and then went out to do a few 
errands. Fred desired to go, of course. At first 


 


Kathie wanted to object ; but then she thought it 
wouldn’t be much worse for her to be bothered with 
him than Aunt Kuth and mamma. 

But he proved a great plague, all because she was 
in a hurry, it seemed. He would stop and slide ; 
then he fell down, and she had to halt and pick 
him up and comfort him. 

“ Oh, I ’ve hurt my hand ! ” he cried. “ Look at it, 
Kathie ; isn’t it bleeding ? ” 

“ It ’s so dark I can’t see. No, I guess not. Put 
on your mitten again.” 

“ It hurts so, it hurts so ! Oh dear ! ” 

“ If you hadn’t run back to slide, you see, it would 
n’t have happened ; and sister ’s in a hurry too. 
Where ’s your mitten ? ” 

“ I laid it down there when I hurt my hand. O 
dear ! I wish I hadn’t come. Kathie, what made 
you bring me ? ” 

“ I ’m sure I didn’t want to, for you ’re a great 
bother. Let ’s go back and find the mitten, if we 
can, — your nice new ones that Aunt Butli just knit ! 
and she would be very sorry if you lost one.” 

“ I ’ll sit here and cry while you go, Kathie. I ’m 
so cold, I ’m ’most frozen.” 



Kathie was out of patience, and wanted to give 
him a good shaking and a good scolding ; but she 
thought of the giant just in time. She felt around 
the spot where Freddy had fallen, and soon found 
the lost article. 

“ Now, Fred, if you ’ve had a good cry, we ’ll 
run home, and I ’ll tell you a story about a little 
boy ” ; and Kathie made quite a ludicrous affair 
out of his accident. 

“ O, that ’s me,” lie said, laughing. “ I was a great 
baby. My hand don’t hurt any now, and I guess it ’s 
all well.” 

When Rob opened his eyes the lamp was burning, 
and he heard a subdued stir as of supper-dishes. He 
felt quite hungry, and thought of his broth, and was 
just going to call, when a little reflection made him 
pause. 

“ I ’ll wait till mother ’s through,” he decided, 
which was quite a great effort for him. 

“ Kathie, go see if Rob is still asleep,” his mother 
said presently. 

“No, I’m awake, and hungry as a bear. Can I 
have some broth ? ” 

His mother had it on the stove, keeping warm. 





She poured it into another bowl and brought it 
to him. 

He took two or three spoonfuls ravenously and 
then stopped. “ Mother, this is as salt as brine ; 
just taste of it.” 

She smiled. “You would have it made salt, you 
know, but I have some other, only you must wait 
until it gets warm.” 

“ I ’ll wait,” he said, very pleasantly, though it 
seemed to him he would have to eat up the sheet 
and pillows, he was so nearly starved. 

“ Mother,” he said, when she returned, “ sick peo- 
ple are very queer ; aren’t they ? ” 

“ Yes, Rob ” ; and she drew a long breath. 

“I ’ve made you a good deal of trouble this 
afternoon,” he went on, penitently. “ I ’m sorry, only 
I did feel so sure about the book. I don’t see how 
I came to forget.” 

“Very easily on that day, Rob. You were not 
well, and then being so sick immediately after, it was 
not at all strange. That isn’t near so bad as being 
positive when you are well and ought to remem- 
ber.” 

It was a great excuse of his to say that he forgot 



More than once the picture of Kathie fighting her 
giant had entered his mind. He was older, and 
ought to do as much, surely. 

“ When I get well I'll try and he more careful,” 
he said, in a low tone. “ You ’re so good and patient, 
mother ! ” 

She bent over to kiss him, and he clasped his arms 
tightly around her neck. 

“ Oh mother, if you were dead, what would become 
of me ! It ’s so nice to have you ” ; and Rob sobbed 
softly. “When I ’m a man you shall not work at 
all I'll have a nice house and a servant to wait on 
you.” 

“ If I have a good boy, and a good, honorable, 
useful man, I shall be satisfied.” 

Rob lay still for a long while and thought. 
Without meaning to be, he was a great, boisterous, 
selfish fellow, not half as useful as Kathie. Of 
course she was a girl, and — but Rob’s conscience 
told him that it was rather cowardly to expect girls 
to do all the work, and practise all the virtues, 
simply because they were girls. If he could get well, 
Kathie shouldn’t run of all the errands while he 
wa» off having fun. He meant to make her a black 





ring, and lend her his drawing-pencils whenever she 
wanted them. And he wouldn’t laugh at her, nor 
be rough, nor — And in the midst of his resolves 
Rob fell asleep. 


 


CHAPTER VII. 

Freddy’s troubles. 

The next morning it rained. It was Saturday, 
too, and Freddy had to stay in the house. Rob felt 
much improved, and thought he would like to get up 
and have his breakfast. 

“ And while you ’re eating it I ’ll sweep the par- 
lor,” said Katliie, “ if you don’t mind being taken 
out in the kitchen.” 

“ Oh no, I shall like it ; I am about tired of this 
room.” 

Katliie brought out a little stand and put a fresh 
white towel over it ; then she begged her mother to 
let Rob have a china cup and plate. Mrs. Alston 
had kept a set of odd, antique china that had been 
her mother’s, and Katliie thought them marvels of 
beauty and daintiness. 

She washed Rob’s face and brushed his hair. 
Her little fingers were so soft and gentle that he 
felt like kissing them. And there was his break- 





fast looking as tempting as if it had been set for 
a prince. 

“ I didn’t have any toast nor any jelly,” said Fred, 
surveying it with longing eyes. 

“ But you ’re not sick,” was lvatliie’s answer. 

“ Oh, I wish I was ; sick people always have such 
nice things.” 

“And they also have headaches and pains, and 
take dreadful medicine. That part of it isn’t very 
nice, Freddy,” Rob rejoined. 

“ Did your head ache ? ” 

“ Yes, indeed.” 

“ Well, I ’d like to have a headache,” Freddy said, 
reflectively ; “ then I could smell out of Aunt Ruth’s 
nice little bottle.” 

Rob laughed. 

“ Don’t lean on Rob’s table,” said Aunt Ruth ; 
“ you ’ll tip it over.” 

“ And that would be table-tippings,” suggested 
Rob, with a smile. 

“ Do you want all the toast ? ” 

Freddy had edged round to Rob’s vicinity. 

“ Run away,” said his mother ; “ you mustn’t 
stand here teasing Rob.” 


 


Aunt Euth poured the tea. Breakfast tasted ex« 
cellently to Eob. Beside the jelly, he had a little 
piece of meat broiled, and altogether he was making 
cpiite a meal. Indeed, he thought he would have felt 
well but for a curious lightness in his head and a 
weakness in his limbs. 

Freddy was balancing himself on one leg of the 
bench. By and by there was a crash ; over went 
Freddy and the bench. Eob was weak and nervous, 
and gave a jump. 

“ Oh Freddy,” said his mother, “you have been told 
not to do that ! ” 

“ O dear ! Oh dear ! my head is split open ! No, 
it ’s got a great bump. Oh dear ! ” 

“It served you just right, Freddy, for disobeying 
mamma. Now, stop crying ; it makes too much 
noise for Eob.” 

“ Oh dear ! if he had his head hurt — ” 

“ Hush, or I shall send you up stairs in the 
eold.” 

Freddy cried to himself a little while, but that 
wasn’t much fun. Presently he looked up at the 
table. “ There, you ’ve eaten all the toast ! ” 
he exclaimed, ruefully. 





“ And not had enough. Mamma must toast me 
some more, and if you ’ll sit still five minutes you 
shall have a piece.” 

Fred mounted a chair, feet and all. He wore 
a pair of old shoes because they were so much 
less noisy than his boots ; and now he espied the 
string dangling from one, and thought he would 
take a quiet play at horse while he was waiting. 
So he trotted the one foot up and down, holding 
the strings as reins ; and though lie did want to 
sing out, “ Two forty on the plank-road,” by a great 
effort he managed to say it softly, though it was 
n’t half as good. The pony came home, and he 
tied him up in the stable. This process was fas- 
tening the strings to the chair-back. 

“ Isn’t it five minutes ? ” he asked, looking round. 

“ Hot quite ; but you ’ve been a tolerably good 
boy, so here ’s some toast and jelly.” 

Fred gave a bound of delight. Alas ! down he 
came sprawling on the floor, with the chair over him. 
Pony, at this juncture, broke the rein, and freed him- 
self by a vigorous kick. 

“ Oh Fred ! what is the matter ? ” and his mother 
picked him up. He cried pretty hard at first ; but, 


 


finding that lie was not much hurt, began to vary 
the exercises hy talking at the same time. A queer 
jumble he made of his horse in the stable and 
the toast ; and it was some time before matters 
could be explained satisfactorily. 

Rob laughed till the tears came in his eyes, the 
affair seemed so comical to him. 

“ Keeping a fast horse is rather dangerous, Fred ; 
and trying to keep you still is almost impossible.” 

“ But I was still. I never spoke a word but softly, 
and I didn’t make a bit of noise.” 

“ And came down with a crash at last. Since you 
didn’t break your neck nor the chair, we ’ll try to stop 
your mouth with the toast, and be thankful ; only next 
time you fall I think you ’ll split my head open.” 

Fred looked as if he was considering how it could 
be done. His mother tied his shoe, wiped the tears 
from his face, and gave him strict injunctions about 
his future behavior. Then he was allowed to have 
the toast and jelly. 

" Now,” said Aunt Ruth, “ suppose you get your 
picture-book and sit down on the floor a little while. 
You can’t very well fall there.” 

Freddy obeyed with alacrity. 





“ Aunt Ruth, here ’s Harry and his dog. The dog 
pulled Harry out of the water and he gave him a sil- 
ver collar.” 

" Who, the dog ? ” asked Rob. 

“ Yes, the dog.” 

“ And the dog led Harry around by a chain which 
was fast to the silver collar ! ” 

“ Ho, he didn’t ; Harry led the dog. I ’m telling 
Aunt Ruth, not you.” 

Rob concluded he would try the lounge awhile. 
He could begin to help himself. 

Fred went on with his story, raising his voice at 
every new sentence. 

“ Hot quite so loud,” said Rob. 

“ I ’ve read my book all through,” Fred began 
presently. “ Can ’t I play with my blocks ? ” 

“ I ’m afraid you will make too much noise.” 

“Ho, I won’t. I ’ll be just as still as a mouse or a 
squirrel.” 

“ We ’ll take the mouse part,” said Rob. 

So Fred began to build a tower. Of course, before 
he could get the top block on, down came the whole 
edifice with a crash. Rob, being just on the point of 
a doze, nearly sprang “ out of his skin.” 


 


“ Oh ! ” Fred exclaimed, aghast. “ I was so sure it 
wouldn’t tumble down ! ” 

“ Don’t build a high one,” said Aunt Ruth, softly. 

“ Just one more, auntie. I ’ll be very sure that it 
won’t fall down.” 

“ No, not one.” 

Fred knew he must obey that tone. At first he had 
a mind to kick the blocks to the four corners of the 
room, but a second thought warned him that such a 
course would not be prudent. But somehow he could 
n’t get any low houses to suit. Presently he made a 
long inclined plane, when a happy thought popped 
into his head. He went very softly to his box, so as 
not to wake up Rob, took out some marbles and 
dropped them down the little square at the upper 
end. They rattled along, fell off the step at the bot- 
tom and rolled round the floor. 

“ Oh Freddy ! ” said Rob, “ you are the noisiest boy 
that I ever saw.” 

“ It ’s real mean for you to be sick ! A fellow 
can’t have any fun at all ! ” and Fred gave the nearest 
marble a vigorous kick that made it bound up 
against the wall. 

Katliie had finished the parlor, and was going up 
stairs to sweep. 





“ I guess I ’ll take Fred along and amuse him,” 
she said, “ and maybe Rob can get asleep.” 

Freddy was delighted. He trudged up stairs, carry- 
ing the dust-brush as a great favor. Kathie made the 
beds, put away a pile of clean clothes, and then began 
to sweep. Freddy would run, to be sure, and when 
he helped dust, for he was delighted to work with 
Kathie, it proved a rather noisy operation, though she 
hoped they did not hear the sound very plainly down 
stairs. 

She had just finished the rooms and put her dust- 
pan in the little square hall, when Freddy, who was 
following fast upon her and asking a multitude of 
questions, stepped upon something that tilted and 
made him jump. Clatter, clatter went the pan down 
stairs, bumping every step and spilling the dust. 

“ You put it right there in the way,” began Fred, 
anxious to justify himself. 

“ I didn’t think it was going to be in the way. I 
quite forgot about an unlucky little boy who meets 
with accidents on every side.” 

“ That ’s because Rob ’s sick.” 

“ The very reason why we ought to be still.” 

“ But don’t you know everything always happens 


 


when you don’t want it ? ” said Fred, with great 
earnestness. 

" I believe it does. Now I ’ve. only the stairs to 
sweep, and you ’ll be in my way. Eun in the kitchen 
and be just as good as you can until I come.” 

Fred went very reluctantly. 

"Well, General,” said Eob, "what was the last 
explosion ? ” 

“ There wasn’t any — any — splutter,” Fred re- 
turned, slowly. 

A 

"We heard a great one and thought you had knocked 
the chimney over. Or was it you bouncing down 
stairs ? ” 

Fred looked rather sulky and made no answer. It 
was a fine thing for Eob to lie abed and scold about 
everybody. 

" I think Fred is the noisiest boy that was ever 
created,” Eob went on ; " don’t you, mother ? ” 

“ Boys in general have a faculty of making a racket 
very easily.” 

" Don’t you, Aunt Euth ? ” 

Aunt Euth smiled. Just then Kathie entered the 
room. 

" I ’ll leave it to you all,” said Eob, " if Fred doesn’t 





make more noise in a day than I ever made in a 
week.” 

A wise and roguish light came into Kathies eyes, 
and Rob remembered their Sunday-night talk before 
lie was sick. 

“ Do you really think I ever made such a continu- 
ous racket? ” he went on, loath to give up his cause. 
“ Why, it seems to me that Fred hasn’t been still 
three minutes since he was out of bed.” 

“ You notice everything so much more easily when 
you are ill,” Aunt Ruth explained. “ Fred has been 
rather unfortunate this morning, I will admit ; but 
your mother and I have become so accustomed to 
noise that we hardly notice it. Though when one 
has a headache and the door slams — ” 

“ That ’s me, Aunt Ruth,” Rob said, soberly. “ It 
always seems so much handier to push a door than 
to stop and shut it ; and even if you only give it the 
least mite of a touch it ’s sure to slam. But I guess 
I shall think of it hereafter.” 

“ One learns many of these things by experience. 
It is good to be sick once or twice in the course 
of one’s lifetime.” 

Rob thought, while the dinner was getting ready,
