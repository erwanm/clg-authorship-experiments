THE FIRST WONDERS 107 

It was Jerusalem and the Temple ; and he stood, 
in the first thoughtfulness of his young manhood, 
among the phantasmagoria o Passover week, for 
he seemed to himself, in such a panorama, but a 
phantom among the shades of a mad world. Half 
of what he saw distressed him, and the rest inspired. 
He shrank, as he had always done, from the sacred 
butchery of worship. He pitied the lambs so, that 
he could not bear to look upon the priests. 

The fishermen and the strangers who clung to 
him were clamoring for what they called miracles 
(for the thing that he had done at Cana had fol- 
lowed him like his disciples ever since), but he dis- 
tanced them by an appeal of his hand, and moved 
away alone. He approached the sacred veil with 
the emotion of a devout worshiper. Tears sprang 
to his eyes when he bowed before the Ark ; for the 
Holy of Holies lay within his own heart, and all his 
nature was a prayer. 

Crowding about him, his people slew dumb things 
to pay Heaven a price for their sins. He sought 
for guilt in himself. "What was it ? What did it 
mean? How should a man sm? How could a 
child of God distress his Father? It was impos- 
sible to grasp the consciousness of it ! He slaugh- 
tered no lamb to bum upon any altar, 'he could 
not do it. But at that solemn Passover, the 6rst of 
his sad, grand manhood, he offered and consumed 



" I shall be the Sacrifice," he thought. 
Filled with incommunicable emotion, he passed 
out of the Inner Temple, and came suddenly upon a, 



108 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

raving scene. The brokers ! they had possession 
of the outer courts, and the air resounded with their 
greedy roars. People from all parts of the world 
crowded up, gesticulating, haranguing, bargaining, 
changing the coin of all nations for the currency 
that might be accepted in the Jewish Temple, hag- 
gling for the sheep, the oxen, and the doves to slay. 
The sacred spot rang with the rage of a wild ex- 
change. The vulgarity, the desecration, the hideous- 
ness, were more than the Nazareiie could bear. The 
whole sight flared like blasphemy before his blazing 
eyes, yet moist as they were with the dew of prayer 
and consecration. Instantly the meek worshiper 
towered into an outraged God. A little, unnoticed 
cord (it had been used to bind some butchered 
thing) was lying near by ; it twisted for a moment 
in his nervous fingers, then it uncoiled from his 
hand, like a snake, and leaped. He rose to a majoB- 
tic height. His mien was something for that mo- 
ment awful to look upon. Lashiug and purtmiug, 
he strode down. The swish of the cord hissed In 
the air, but sharper the accents of his scorn. 
" God's house your den ! Ye tld<wn ! " 
Thus rang from the lips of Jesus Inn first protest 
against the ecclesiastical abuses of his day. And 
then was born against him the demon of a grudge, one 
of those silent, venomous hatreds which bring down 
a day of inevitable reckoning tzpou any man who 
arouses them. From the Temple boothn the High 
Priest's family is said to have received enormous 
revenues, and from that hour the nullcm cyo of 
Annas singled out the Nazarene. 



THE FIRST WONDERS 109 

But, for the moment, the brokers slunk away like 
beaten curs. Not a hand was raised against him ; 
they so many, he but one. The scattered coins lay 
trampled under fleeing feet. No man stayed to pick 
up the money. 

He stood alone, quivering. There ran from him 
a medley of scattering animals and cringing men. 
The look of his eyes sprang after them, like flames 
of holy fire. 

He stood untroubled, undefiled, as God might 
stand behind the judgment bar, as fearless and 
as solitary. At that moment his sense of power 
flooded his being. 

The great Temple rose behind him, gorgeous, in- 
tricate, a marvel of architecture, forty and six years 
in building. 

" Destroy it ! " he cried, carried on a wave of glo- 
rified assurance stronger than he had ever known ; 
" I will build it in three days I "

It was in Samaria, and he was traveling. He 
spent the dull intervals between the few brilliant 
moments, of that year in the commonplace duties of 
an itinerant teacher. A preacher he had not yet 
presumed to be. 

With characteristic modesty he had refrained 
from any appearance of rivalry with the career of 
the prophet from whom he had accepted religious in- 
itiation, lie had gone on quietly, for the most part 
practicing the methods of John as he had studied 
them. To his few followers he delegated certain im- 
portant religiouR functions; among others, that of 
performing the rite of baptism, 



110 THE STORY OP JESUS CHRIST 

He taught and prayed and exhorted. Now and 
then into the routine of his obscure service some- 
thing wonderful crept. There were tales and rumors 
of hountiful movements of his heart resulting in 
strange consequences. But chiefly he had been 
leading the ordinary life of a humble evangelist. 
His methods were intensely practical. He denounced 
sin and urged repentance ; he gave himself up for 
this year to the most unwelcome of human tasks, 
that of starting in a community or a people the 
consciousness of their moral degradation without tak- 
ing advantage of it to place himself in a position of 
very great prominence or spiritual ascendency over 
them. His own soul at this time was a sleeping 
mine. He had the great forces of reserve, of self- 
abeyance, of that which can bide its time. ITis 
future, the fate of his nation, the hope of the world, 
lay staked upon his silence, his submission, his wil- 
lingness to be unknown and unsuccessful, hi powor 
to exchange a warm and splendid dream for a chill 

and gray reality.

The cool of the day was coming on. II o was very 
tired. His friends had loft him for a while; they 
were seeking food for him and for themselves in 
the town chosen for their night 1 M lodging Syeliar

than that of the founders of the race* 



THE FIRST WONDERS 111 

The sunset was falling from glory to tenderness, 
and all its colors were mild. Something soothing in 
their tone crept from the sky to his heart. 

The interrogation of his own nature which went 
on in him steadily through depression and elation, 
receiving uneven replies, but never abandoned be- 
cause these might be faint or discouraging, spoke to 
him then with the movement of a rising cry. 

His head was turned in the attitude of one who 
listens to that which no man else can hear. His 
large eyes were fastened upon the dying day, whose 
luminousness seemed to have entered into and re- 
mained in them after it had left the clouds. 

He was so absorbed that the movement of a wo- 
man's robe near him did not arouse his attention, or 
did not seem to do so. 

She glanced up lightly, then quite gravely looked 
at him. The tinkling of a bangle on her brow 
seemed to embarrass her, as if it were an obtrusion 
on a silence meant for better things, and impul- 
sively she drew her hand over the clanking coins of 
gold and silver and hushed the flippant sound. She 
had set down her water-jar to do this, and stood at 
the edge of the well with both beautiful arms free. 
They were bared and she was unveiled. 

The traveler did not look at her, and she bent to 
draw the water with which to fill her jar. The 
silence was not oppressive to her, for it was natural 
and expected. The stranger was plainly a Jew, and 
with her people the Jews were not on social terms. 
To women of her kind (as she perceived with the 
keenness and swiftness of her class), this man per- 



112 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

sonally was not in any event liable to lower himself 
by passing 1 the commonest salutation of the day. 
That he should ignore her was a matter of course. 
Her astonishment began when he spoke. 

" Give me to drink," he said gently. His voice 
sounded far removed from her, though he was so 
near. He did not turn his head, nor detain his eyes 
from the darkening sky, but the words flowed out 
like the current of an unseen river bathing the 
shores of an unknown world. 

She stood staring. Then he turned and looked 
her full in the eye. She was a voluble creature, and 
exclamations, amazement, questions, tumbled over 
each other. He continued to look at her silently. 
Then her own eyes dropped. When he saw this, 
he began to talk with her. 

As they conversed affably and earnestly he a 
young Rabbi with a position to maintain, she a wo- 
man to have speech with whom was enough to cost 
him his reputation the emotion in his own heart 
rose high. Carried upon it, he floated above her 
low history. He confronted her with its episodes, 
necessarily unknown to him, a stranger. Ho re- 
buked her for them boldly. Yet did ho tako the 
pains to reason with her, and allure her to a bettor 
view of life. With the rospoot for womanhood 
which was marked in him, ho ingoniounly aroused 
her own lost sense of moclcBty. It was a*dolioato 
task not a great one, as the world looks at moral 
achievements to restore self-respect to a woman 
who had thought herself below it ; but the soul of 
Jesus climbed on this rude pathway to a far, fine 



THE FIRST WONDERS 113 

height. His breath came fast, like that of a moun- 
tain traveler in an altitude too high for ordinary 
respiration. Vision and prayer blended and sepa- 
rated and met again. His eye glowed gravely. 
His pale, dark cheek lost its faint tinge of color. 
His troubled consciousness, for months past surging 
to and fro within him like a tide whose moon did 
not reveal herself by fixed expression, took to it- 
self one of the movements which surpassed all com- 
mon laws. 

" I know, sir, that when the Messiah comes " 
The word, over which his mind and heart had grown 
so sore and anxious for so long, fell low from the 
lips of the woman, spoken softly between her sobs. 

But Jesus, when he heard it, rose to his feet. His 
full height stood against the west. His soul's height 
rose with it. The truth which so often eluded him 
radiated from his eye, his smile, his brow, his out- 
stretched hands. 

"I," he said, "am He." 

His exaltation had not departed from him when 
his friends returned. It so shone upon him that 
no man of them dared trouble him. They stared 
at the woman with dismay, but no one obtruded a 
question on his breach of etiquette. He seemed 
grand enough to be the master of all customs, the 
maker of all laws. Every petty thought or foolish 
query went down before his look. Affectionately 
they begged him to take food, for a man may not 
live on ecstasy. 

But he motioned them away with these to them 
mysterious, and to all men matchless, words : " I 



114: THE STORY OF JESUS CHEIST 

have meat to eat. Ye know not of it. ... My meat 
is to do His Will." 

Then, for his heart and his lips were freed, he 
broke into a strain of commanding address, assum- 
ing for that hour his oratorical and his spiritual 
rank. It captured the village. Hospitality was 
pressed upon him. Gratified, he accepted it for a 
few days. He was startled when it was reported 
to him that the citizens, gathering about the poor 
woman and treating her with the respect due to a 
despised person who had been suddenly subject to 
the notice of a revered one, had called him by the 
most solemn appellation that the lip of man could 
utter, or the mind of man conceive : 

" The Christ ; the Saviour of the World." 



CHAPTER V

of disaster then, as ever, found 
wings. In spite of the leisurely movement of news 
which our electric civilization lacks the imagination 
to appreciate, the fact of a great public and personal 
trouble quickly reached the ears of Jesus. 

John, the prophet and preacher, had met his 
natural fate. This young zealot had followed his 
grand sense of duty one step too far. He had 
meddled with the vices of the throne, and the 
throne had replied. For the sake of denouncing a 
royal amom\ dignified by the illegal name of mar- 
riage, John had sacrificed his liberty and was to 
sacrifice his life. It may seem doubtful to us if 
this fearless deed were quite worth while, but it did 
not seem doubtful to him who did it. The brave 
man, the freest of all his classman out-of-door philo- 
sopher, accustomed to the weather and the sky, to 
sleeping on the ground, to eating with the wild bees 
at their own carved tables ; a strong and steady 
walker, dependent on exercise and air, and on the 
liberty of his own mental and muscular moods, lan- 
guished in the dungeons of Herod to any man 
an unspeakable fate ; to him, of all men, one of the 
worst, 



116 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

How far did the prophetic gift accompany him in 
that dark and noisome suspense ? One may hope 
that it mercifully failed him a little then and there. 
Did the windows of the approaching future open 
and show him the dizzy scene of a splendid enter- 
tainment in the palace one hot, bright night ? the 
whispering of women royal only in name ? the re- 
venge of an adulteress upon a man of God? the 
hesitation of a girl young, beautiful, vain, good- 
natured, but used to obeying an imperious mother ? 
Did he hear the cymbal in her long brown fingers, 
the tinkling of the bracelets on her arms ? Did he 
see the other burden, displacing the cymbal, which 
her beautiful hands bore, dripping, through, the hor- 
ror of the dancers beneath the wavering of the 
palace lamps, the scintillation of silver, the color- 
of wet red, the look of eyes surprised by assassi- 
nation in the fitful, early slumber of a dungeon 
night ? 

Or did the curtain fall upon the casement of liis 
mind, and were his last days muffled in hopes of 
life, in visions of the desert where bird and beast 
and man arose and slept and moved at will? in 
dreams of Jordan shining among her reeds, o the 
faces of his converts, of the water glittering on 
them ; of one on which the dove had ranted ; of the 
life for which his own was spent, like baptismal 
water fallen, forgotten, a drop in the stream ? lie 
was content to be spent, and more than content! 
For that was John; the greatest of forerunners, a 
self-obliterated, a man glad to be defeated, so that 
a greater might succeed. 



IN HIS OWN COUNTKY 117 

Shocked beyond expression at the news of his 
cousin's incarceration, Jesus hastened to the refuge 
into which he carried all his difficulties. His fa- 
miliar friend the desert received him, and in the 
strong society of solitude he sought comfort for his 
sorrow. As is always true of a man who knows 
how to value and when to cultivate solitude, he 
found more than he sought. He found the immedi- 
ate direction of his own life. His trouble became 
his guide. From the foreground of his grief the 
mists of his habitual perplexity began to clear 
away* Excepting the death of Joseph, a gentle 
sorrow dating years back, he had known no per- 
sonal bereavement up to this time. The loss of 
John took on something of such a character. 

To his delicate mind the fate which had over- 
taken the man who had sacrificed everything for him 
seemed peculiarly distressing. John's future thus 
blackly quenched, appealed to a certain chivalry 
always easily uppermost in the nature of Christ. 
John's work lay at his feet, a splendid wreck. No 
sense of courtesy to his early religious leader now 
withheld Jesus from the full exercise of his own 
vocation. Rather, every voice .of loyalty and grati- 
tude summoned him to expression. He began at 
once to preach; 

Glowing with sacred indignation, and consumed 
with dread for the fate of his friend, he cast him- 
self BOW into the furnace of a life distinctly to be 
henceforth classed as that of a religious orator. 

Deeply absorbed, he came back from Judea and 
Samaria into Galilee. There he uttered himself. 



118 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

The wayside, the country, the town, received and 
listened to him. His fame as a worker of wonders, 
dating back to his last visit to Jerusalem, preceded 
him, but a greater followed him. Assuming the 
full authority of a rabbi, he exhorted freely ; and, 
without any of the diffidence which had heretofore 
restrained him. At first his discourses were brief 
and modest in the extreme. He felt his way, as all 
young preachers must, to the interest of audiences, 
if not to the measurement of his own powers. The 
nature and extent of these he learned by experience, 
like other men. He developed at the very outset of 
his career an intensely human, well-balanced mind ; 
it was always attentive 'to practical affairs; he did 
not waste himself in speculation, or lose himself in 
aimless Oriental reverie. He sat on no stone pillar 
with crossed and idle feet, a figure given over to 
dreams and desolation, a spectacle for curiosity, a 
scarecrow for common men. lie withdrew iuto no 
useless trance, no remote psychical experimentation. 
He entered into no Nirvana. A plain man among 
men, he took his few friends and trod the country 
over in search of the most useful thing that ho 
could do or say whereby to startle vice ov comfort 
misery. 

These two thoughts, these two purposes, from the 
beginning strode out into the foreground of liis 
mind ; and there they remained, like strong figures 
wrestling with all lesser preoccupation. The ideal 
man of God has always united in ono personality 
the functions of priest and philanthropist. Jesus 
carried on the two preeminently. 



IN HIS OWN COUNTRY 119 

On this tour through Galilee, when the novelty of 
his newly-assumed position as a preacher sat upon 
him with such a young and sparkling enthusiasm 
that he might easily have been pardoned if he had 
overlooked the simpler calls upon him, he showed 
the evenness and breadth of an old and experi- 
enced missionary. At this early point in his story 
he developed almost immediately one of the most 
prominent traits in his character, instinctive, 
abounding sympathy with the sick. 

It was in Cana, where the wedding was. Follow- 
ing some natural impulse to retrace his steps to the 
spot where he had first learned that his personal 
gifts had a practical scope, he revisited the village ; 
now with the stronger step and the manlier brow of 
one who feels that he is acquiring a position, and 
has some right to its recognition. 

He was met by an officer of Herod Antipas, a 
distracted father whose heart was breaking and 
whose boy was dying. The courtier begged the young 
Eabbi to hurry to a stricken home in Capernaum, 
some twenty miles away ; he raised the old, piteous 
cry which grief has sent up to the healers of the 
world from the beginning of time till now : " Come 
down ! come down, ere he die ! " 

" He liveth," replied the Nazarene without hesita- 
tion, " go thy way to him*" 

The prompt and bold reply astounded the town ; 
it may have surprised the speaker himself. The 
words leaped from his lips. There was no recalling 
thorn, if he had wished. He had staked his repu- 
tation on one great inward movement of trust in 



120 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

himself. Would the facts verify or refute his ven- 
ture? 

The young, inexperienced healer and the agitated 
father looked at each other silently. The Rabbi's 
eye did not quail ; that of the father grew calmer ; 
the trust which precedes hope softened its feverish 
depth; the look which one man gives to another 
when he recognizes superiority and hangs his heart's 
desire upon its pledges, passed over his face. It 
was the seventh hour of the day, and growing dark. 
The two men parted without further words ; the one 
to seek a living or a dying child, the other to test 
a living or a dying power on whose genuineness his 
whole future, his faith in himself, his faith in God, 
might depend. Jesus passed the next few days in a 
condition which hovered between unrest and assur- 
ance. Most of his little group of disciples had 
scattered to their homes in neighboring villages, and 
his acquaintances did not suspect the nature of his 
thoughts, for his mien was quiet, and his eye con- 
tent. 

The people of the village talked enough to make 
up for this reticence. Doubt, derision, respect, and 
belief battled from lip to lip. The story of the 
water-jars at the wedding was repeated and re- 
echoed. 

When the news came slowly up from the villa by 
the lakeshore, it was received with less talk and 
more thoughtfulness. Tho crodulouH father, wea- 
rily coming towards homo, afraid to delay, afraid 
to hasten, not daring to enter the door of Ins stricken 
house, and not daring to stay away from the sick- 



IN HIS OWN COUNTRY 121 

room with such encouragement as he bore, sud- 
denly lifting his eyes, saw that the servants were 
running to meet him, tumbling over each other, ges- 
ticulating with Oriental excessiveness, voluble, smil- 
ing. . . . 

Capernaum and Cana nodded and whispered: 
" The fever turned at the seventh hour, and it was 
to the child as the Nazarene had said." When they 
hurried with the tale to Jesus he smiled quietly, 
wondering and blaming himself if there had been 
any hour in which he had expected otherwise. But 
if there had or had not been, he told no man. 

A little, petted boy in a luxurious lakeside man- 
sion, with the laughter of convalescence in his 
eyes, cuddled against the throbbing heart of a father 
whose dark cheeks blazed with joy. But on the 
face of the young healer, pondering in the inland 
town, there shone another happiness. He had tested 
himself. He had tried his own mystery. Its great 
and sacred source had answered to his summons. 
How hesitate? why doubt? He had asked. God 
had replied. That hour sprang up to meet him like 
a herald; a smiling future trod beyond it. Jesus 
knew just then a respite of hope. There now began 
to grow in him a sense of something rooted below 
hope, beneath moods and dreams and longings : the 
consciousness of Power. 

Every public teacher has two especial problems 
before him : that of himself and that of his times. 
In the life of Christ, both of these had unusual 
features. In proportion as a man is above his fel- 
lows, he finds it difficult to understand his own 



122 THE STOBY OF JESUS CHRIST 

nature and to adjust it to common conditions. In 
proportion as his times are extraordinary, Ms work 
is more interesting, but his responsibility for it less 
clear. There is something in the sweep and force 
of great current events which, while it tends to cre- 
ate heroes, tends also to create humility. A man 
may hesitate to take the helm of his times precisely 
because they are so urgent that they seem to be the 
lord rather than the subject of destiny. A modest 
soul may well question its own impulse to assume 
control of forces so masterful that the very essence 
of fate itself appears to be in them. 

Jesus Christ lived in an age which was desperate 
enough and dark enough to confound any human 
intelligence, and to confuse any human conscience. 

Haughty, vicious, and decaying Rome was mis- 
tress of the world. Her destinies were in the hands 
of one man, the commander of a standing army of 
three hundred and forty thousand. Her conquests 
had reached their mathematical limit, and could go 
no farther. Her morals were unutterable, and her 
religion was undecipherable. The apotheosis of the 
emperor was the climax of worship. Prayer was 
chiefly the expression of corruption or of greed. 
A man prayed for the death of a rich relative, or 
for the gratification of wishes such us civilization 
declines to name. When such petitions wore unan- 
swered, he dropped into blasphemy a a creditable 
sequence. Marriage had almost ecoHcxl to be re- 
spected, and, if still respectable, it was only by 
courtesy to a dying tradition. Family life abounded 
in abominations at which modern thought does not 



IN HIS OWN COUNTRY 123 

glance, and public indecency was too black to recall. 
Philosophers themselves were known to practise the 
vices which they professed to scorn. The popula- 
tion of the empire was estimated at one hundred 
and twenty millions ; of these one half were slaves. 
To be a sick slave or an old one was to be cast off 
to perish. The cruelties inflicted on slaves were 
monstrous, merciless, and a matter of course. New- 
born children were murdered whenever it was con- 
venient, and the law made no account of so small a 
matter. 

The fashionable theory of charity took the ground 
that it was hardly worth while to give alms ; better 
to let the beggars die, and out of the way with 
them! Such a thing as a hospital was unknown. 
Life was a deification of corruption, and death but 
an exasperating interruption of vice. Among the 
epitaphs of such an age we long remember an out- 
cry like this over the grave of a child : " To tlie 
unjust gods who robbed me of life." Or this, 
carved in memory of a girl of twenty years : " I lift 
my hands against the god who took me away, inno- 
cent as I am." Such arraignment of Heaven rang 
from the world as has never been exceeded in its 
history. 

Latin authors longed for some assuagement of the 
wide and deep despair. Men whose great names are 
familiar to us in ancient literature revolted from hope, 
and dreamed of virtue as a lost ideal, and looked on 
at human life as a pitiable play, scarcely up to the 
proportions of a farce. 

The Hebrews, the captives of this ripe but decay- 



124 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

ing empire, were not unaffected by the taint of their 
masters. One of their greatest teachers and writers 
thought so lightly of marriage that he sanctioned 
divorce if a wife burned her husband's dinner. The 
easy sin of a religious people abounded, and the 
hypocrite was everywhere. Long prayers, long 
faces, and short virtues went arm in arm. 

Theology had ousted religion, and ecclesiasticism 
had strangled devotion in temples and in synagogues. 
The people were helpless, fierce, and rebellious ; but 
they had the vices of despair, and the errors of a re- 
ligiosity which has so long taken the place of faith 
that men have ceased to know the difference. 

Jesus was profoundly moved by the condition of 
his people and the vices of his times. No philoso- 
pher could have studied them more carefully. Ho 
had known some opportunities to do so in Naaaroth, 
where men from all parts of the world poured by 
upon the caravan routes. He had seen the culture 
of the Greek, the luxury of the Roman, the man- 
ners and characteristics of the Phoenicians, Per- 
sians, Arabians, Chaldeans, and the corruption of 
all. His pure and secluded youth had strongly and 
silently observed, reflected, and stoml up material 
for a mature view of the condition of hiB ago. Ho 
had also stored up sensitiveness all his own. 

Quivering with recoil from the moral horrors by 
which he was surrounded, he flung IUH whole nature 
deliberately and determinedly upon them. lie was 
no Roman gentleman turning with a dilettante in- 
difference from the degradation of his times ; he 
was a Hebrew mechanic, an itinerant missionary, 



IN HIS OWN COUNTRY 125 

pouring the pure energies of a devotee into the pol- 
luted current by which he refused to be stirred. 

In the first fire of his enthusiasm as a preacher, 
he made one apparent mistake. He went to Naza- 
reth. What minister of any times and of any 
people recalls without wincing his first sermon in 
his native place, or in the village of his childhood ? 
The tenderness for old associations, the innocent 
pleasure in appearing before old friends, the inex- 
perienced belief that they would be more glad to 
hear him preach than other people, how reluc- 
tantly these have given place to the surprised pain, 
the slow suspicion, the smarting realization of the 
truth ! In his oldest acquaintances the young ex- 
horter finds his severest critics, his coldest hearers, 
unwilling appreciation. It is the way of the world, 
not one of its noble ways, and Jesus, like other 
leadei'S of men, must needs take the world as he 
found it. 

He arrived in Nazareth, let us think, on a Fri- 
day afternoon. The sun was about to set. The 
Seventh Day was at hand. Already the signs of 
preparation for the Jewish Sabbath stirred across 
the village. Domestic and field work, trade and 
travel, hurried to cessation. The women indoors 
and the men without ran to and fro with busy 
interest. The little town, occupied along the length 
of its rough highway, turned indifferent eyes to 
the mountains which were blazing in the dying 
day, and paid scant attention to the appearance o 
the young citizen who had left a while ago, un- 
known, and was returning famous. Jesus looked 



126 THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST 

at the familiar hills, grand, silent, these in solemn 
shadow, those transfigured with color, all carrying 
the thoughts up ; but the villagers scarcely looked 
at Jesus. Their eyes were on the level earth, his 
on the heights. What wonder that they coiJld not 
meet? 

He had scarcely arrived when there broke upon 
the evening air the clear, strong call of a trum- 
pet uttering itself authoritatively, a double blast. 
The synagogue minister stood on the roof of his 
house with his face towards Jerusalem. Ho an- 
nounced the arrival of the Sabbath. He summoned 
every Hebrew soul within reach of his official cry 
to cease labor and to begin worship. The trumpet 
called three times. When it ceased, the trumpeter 
laid it reverently down by his side, that ho might 
not profane the sacred day by carrying the instru- 
ment. Now, all over the darkening village, from 
every house, there sprang out a gentle spark. The 
Sabbath lamp had been lighted. A gen HO of fes- 
tivity glittered with it. The Sabbath was the 
pledge of affection between God and Israel, and 
every home was arrayed to meet it, like a bride or a 
queen. Every one wore his best clothes* Kvery 
table held its best meal. Benedictions wore spoken 
over the wine and water. The suspension of labor, 
the coming on of rest, the glory of worship, made 
holiday of holyday. The traveler sliared tbo gen- 
eral happiness.

vigorous. The day rose bright and warm. The 
early hour of worship approached. Jesus antici- 
pated it gladly. He walked rapidly (for such was 
Jewish law) to the sombre place where he had wor- 
shiped since he could remember, the old, stiff 
building, dreaded and loved, wherein to laugh or 
joke, or eat or sleep, was sinful, and wherein no 
man but a rabbi might seek shelter from a storm. 

The rustic synagogue was crowded. Jesus mod- 
estly took his accustomed seat among his old neigh- 
bors. His heart was full of thoughts and feelings 
which he wished he could share with them. He 
was so loving, so gentle a man ! He felt tenderly 
towards all these people, among whom he had lived 
so many humble years. He watched for their well- 
known forms and faces as they came in and took 
their seats, the men by themselves, lordly, as 
Jewish men were wont, putting the women apart in 
a gallery of their own. The elders of the meeting 
pompously took their places on the raised platform ; 
behind, stood the movable chest, representative of 
the great Ark of the Temple, and itself containing 
the rolls of the sacred writings. A curtain hung 
across it, and the holy lamp burned before it. 

While he sat there, lost in reverie, modest, gen- 
tle, thinking not of himself, the chief ruler of the 
synagogue came up and spoke to Jesus, formally 
asking him to act for that day as the conductor of 
the services. This request was not unexpected to 
him, as it might have been an act of courtesy or of 
curiosity on the part of his neighbors to extend the 
invitation : due certainly to any rabbi with much.

less than the fame already gathered about the name 
and personality of their townsman. At all events, 
the politeness was paid him. Trusting in the sin- 
cerity of his old friends, believing with his secret 
instincts in their better motives, he confidingly 
accepted their invitation, and rising, stepped to his 
place at the lectern. 

He began the service of the morning in the for- 
mulated manner by repeating the Jewish liturgy. 
This was one of the prayers with which he opened 
that Sabbath meeting in the Nazareth Syna- 
gogue: 

"Blessed be Thou, O Lord, King of the world, 
who formest the lights and Greatest the darkness, 
who makest peace and Greatest everything ; who in 
mercy givest light to the earth, and to those who 
dwell upon it, and in Thy goodness day by day and 
every day renewest the works of creation. Blessed 
be the Lord our God for the glory of his handi- 
works and for the light-giving lights which He lias 
made for our praise. Selah. Blessed be the Lord 
our God who has formed the lights.' 5 

The invocation sounds a little cold or dull to our 
ears. The young preacher of that summer morn- 
ing was accustomed to do it reverence ; it was the 
liturgy of his church, and of his childhood; yet, 
certain public prayers of his own, uttered later in 
the course of his ministry, and immortal to human 
needs and worship, indicate something of the dis- 
tance of his nature from the formality to which he 
deferred. 

He deferred, however, and he conformed to the 



UST HIS OWN COUNTET 129 

customs of Hs church, like a man of acquaintance 
with life, up to a certain point. When he reached 
that point he departed promptly and thoroughly. 
He followed the usual order of exercise; another 
prayer and a better one succeeding the first ; then 
came the repetition of the creed, another prayer and 
six eulogies or benedictions ; at their close a distin- 
guished rabbi was at liberty to add certain prayers 
of his own which might be fixed or free. At last 
the time for his discourse arrived. The sacred roll 
was taken from the ark and handed to him by the 
chazzan or minister. 

On this occasion the lesson for the day was from 
one of the greatest of Jewish prophets. Jesus se- 
lected as his text from Isaiah, these impressive 
words : 

" The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He 
hath anointed me to preach the good tidings to the 
poor ; ... to preach release to the captives, and re- 
covering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them 
that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of 
the Lord." 

Having read the text in Hebrew, translating as 
he went into the common tongue, he gave the roll 
back to the minister, and according to the custom 
of his church sat down to preach. 

He looked for a moment silently over his audi- 
ence. Familiar faces answered his gaze with curi- 
osity or with that doubt of his ability to give them 
a remarkable sermon, natural to a man's fellow- 
townsmen who have known him since he was a little 
boy among them. " He is just like us. What can
