upon yesterday's toilet, studied the effect a moment, 
and turned away. She ran back for another look, 
and the next moment she was walking down to 
the water-gate, where she found Nina waiting her 
in the gondola. 

A rapid course brought them to Ferris's landing. 
" Ring," she said to the gondolier, u and say that 
one of the American ladies wishes to see the con 
sul." 

Ferris was standing on the balcony over her, 
where he had been watching her approach in mute 
wonder. " Why, Miss Vervain," he called down, 
" what in the world is the matter ? " 



 

"I don 't know. I want to see you," said Flor 
ida, looking up with a wistful face. 

" I'll come down." 

" Yes, please. Or no, I had better come up. 
Yes, Nina and I will come up." 

Ferris met them at the lower door and led them 
to his apartment. Nina sat down in the outer 
room, and Florida followed the painter into his stu 
dio. Though her face was so wan, it seemed to 
him that he had never seen it lovelier, and he had 
a strange pride in her being there, though the 
disorder of the place ought to have humbled him. 
She looked over it with a certain childlike, timid 
curiosity, and something of that lofty compassion 
with which young ladies regard the haunts of men 
when they come into them by chance ; in doing 
this she had a haughty, slow turn of the head that 
fascinated him. 

" I hope," he said, " you don 't mind the smell," 
which was a mingled one of oil-colors and tobacco- 
smoke. " The woman's putting my office to rights, 
and it's all in a cloud of dust. So I have to brino- 



you in here." 

Florida sat down on a chair fronting the easel, 
and found herself looking into the sad eyes of Don 
Ippolito. Ferris brusquely turned the back of the 
canvas toward her. u I didn 't mean you to see 
that. It isn 't  ready to show, yet," he said, and 
then he stood expectantly before her. He waited 
for her to speak, for he never knew how to take 



 

Miss Vervain ; he was willing enough to make light 
of her grand moods, but now she was too evidently 
unhappy for mocking ; at the same time he did not 
care to invoke a snub by a prematurely sympathetic 
demeanor. His mind ran on the events of the day 
before, and he thought this visit probably related 
somehow to Don Ippolito. But his visitor did not 
speak, and at last he said : "I hope there's noth 
ing wrong at home, Miss Vervain. It's rather odd 
to have yesterday, last night, and next morning all 
run together as they have been for me in the last 
twenty-four hours. I trust Mrs. Vervain is turn 
ing the whole thing into a good solid oblivion." 

" It's about it's about I came to see you " 
said Florida, hoarsely. " I mean," she hurried on 
to say, " that I want to ask you who is the best 
doctor here ? " 

Then it was not about Don Ippolito. " Is your 
mother sick?" asked Ferris, eagerly. " She must 
have been fearfully tired by that unlucky expedi 
tion of ours. I hope there's nothing serious ? " 

" No, no ! But she is not well. She is very 
frail, you know. You must have noticed how frail 
she is," said Florida, tremulously. 

Ferris had noticed that all his countrywomen, 
past their girlhood, seemed to be sick, he did not 
know how or why ; he supposed it was all right, it 
was so common. In Mrs. Vervain's case, though 
she talked a great deal about her ill-health, he had 
noticed it rather less than usual, she had so great 




spirit. He recalled now that lie had thought her 
at times rather a shadowy presence, and that occa 
sionally it had amused him that so slight a structure 
should hang together as it did not only success 
fully, but triumphantly. 

He said yes, he knew that Mrs. Vervain was 
not strong, and Florida continued : " It's only ad 
vice that I want for her, but I think we had better 
see some one or know some one that we could go 
to in need. We are so far from any one we know, 
or help of any kind." She seemed to be trying to 
account to herself, rather than to Ferris, for what 
she was doing. " We must n t let anything pass 
unnoticed " . . . . She looked at him entreat- 
ingly, but a shadow, as of some wounding memory, 
passed over her face, and she said no more. 

" I'll go with you to a doctor's," said Ferris, 
kindly. 

" No, please, I won 't trouble you." 

" It's no trouble." 

" I don 't want you to go with me, please. I d 
rather go alone," Ferris looked at her perplexedly, 
as she rose. " Just give me the address, and I shall 
manage best by myself. I'm used to doing it." 

" As you like. Wait a moment." Ferris wrote 
the address. " There," he said, giving it to her ; 
" but isn 't  there anything I can do for you ? " 

" Yes," answered Florida with awkward hesita 
tion, and a half-defiant, half-imploring look at him. 
" You must have all sorts of people applying to 



 

you, as a consul ; and you look after their affairs 
and try to forget them " 

"Well?" said Ferris. 

" I wish you would n t remember that I've asked 
this favor of you ; that you d consider it a " 

" Consular service ? With all my heart," an 
swered Ferris, thinking for the third or fourth time 
how very young Miss Vervain was. 

" You are very good ; you are kinder than I have 
any right," said Florida, smiling piteously. " I only 
mean, don 't speak of it to my mother. Not," she 
added, " but what I want her to know everything I 
do ; but it would worry her if she thought I was 
anxious about her. Oh! I wish I wouldn 't." 

She began a hasty search for her handkerchief ; 
he saw her lips tremble and his soul trembled with 
them. 

In another moment, " Good-morning," she said 
briskly, with a sort of airy sob, " I don 't want you 
to come down, please." 

She drifted out of the room and down the stairs, 
the servant-maid falling into her wake. 

Ferris filled his pipe and went out on his balcony 
again, and stood watching the gondola in its course 
toward the address he had given, and smoking 
thoughtfully. It was really the same girl who had 
given poor Don Ippolito that cruel slap in the face, 
yesterday. But that seemed no more out of reason 
than her sudden, generous, exaggerated remorse ; 
both were of a piece with her coming to him for 



 

help now, holding him at a distance, flinging her 
self upon his sympathy, and then trying to snub 
him, and breaking down in the effort. It was all 
of a piece, and the piece was bad ; yes, she had an 
ugly temper ; and yet she had magnanimous traits 
too. These contradictions, which in his reverie lie 
felt rather than formulated, made him smile, as he 
stood on his balcony bathed by the morning air and 
sunlight, in fresh, strong ignorance of the whole 
mystery of women's nerves. These caprices even 
charmed him. He reflected that he had gone on 
doing the Vervains one favor after another in spite 
of Florida's childish petulancies ; and he resolved 
that he would not stop now ; her whims should be 
nothing to him, as they had been nothing, hitherto. 
It is flattering to a man to be indispensable to a 
woman so long as he is not obliged to it : Miss Ver 
vain's dependent relation to himself in this visit 
gave her a grace in Ferris's eyes which she had 
wanted before. 

In the mean time he saw her gondola stop, turn 
round, and come back to the canal that bordered 
the Vervain garden. 

" Another change of mind," thought Ferris, com 
placently ; and rising superior to the whole fitful 
sex, he released himself from uneasiness on Mrs. 
Vervain's account. But in the evening he went to 
ask after her. He first sent his card to Florida, 
having written on it, " I hope Mrs. Vervain is bet 
ter. don 't let me come in if it's any disturb- 



 

ance." He looked for a moment at what lie had 
written, dimly conscious that it was patronizing : 
and when he entered he saw that Miss Vervain 
stood on the defensive and from some willfulness 
meant to make him feel that he was presumptuous 
in coming ; it did not comfort him to consider that 
she was verv young. " Mother will be in directly," 
said Florida in a tone that relegated their morning's 
interview to the age of fable. 

Mrs. Vervain came in smiling and cordial, appar 
ently better and not worse for yesterday's misad 
ventures. 

" Oh, I pick up quickly," she explained. " I'm 
an old campaigner, you know. Perhaps a little too 
old, now. Years .do make a difference ; and you'll 
find it out as you get on, Mr. Ferris." 

" I suppose so," said Ferris, not caring to have 
Mrs. Vervain treat him so much like a boy. " Even 
at twenty-six I found it pleasant to take a nap this 
afternoon. How does one stand it at seventeen, 
Miss Vervain ? " he asked. 

"I haven t felt the need of sleep," replied Flor 
ida, indifferently, and he felt shelved, as an old fellow. 

He had an empty, frivolous visit, to his thinking. 
Mrs. Vervain asked if he had seen Don Ippolito, 
and wondered that the priest had. not come about, 
all day. She told a long story, and at the end 
tapped herself on the mouth with her fan to pun 
ish a yawn. 

Ferris rose to go. Mrs. Vervain wondered again 



in the same words why Don Ippolito had not been 
near them all day. 

" Because he's a wise man," said Ferris with bit 
terness, " and knows when to time his visits." Mrs. 
Vervain did not notice his bitterness, but something 
made Florida follow him to the outer door. 

" Why, it's moonlight ! " she exclaimed ; and 
she glanced at him as though she had some purpose 
of atonement in her mind. 

But he would not have it. " Yes, there's a 
moon," he said moodily. " Good-night." 

" Good night," answered Florida, and she impul 
sively offered him her hand. He thought that it 
shook in his, but it was probably the agitation of 
his own nerves. 

A soreness that had been lifted from his heart, 
came back ; he walked home disappointed and de 
feated, he hardly knew why or in what. He did 
not laugh now to think IIOAV she had asked him that 
morning to forget her coming to him for help ; he 
was outraged that he should have been repaid in 
this sort, and the rebuff with which his sympathy 
had just been met was vulgar; there was no other 
name for it but vulgarity. Yet he could not relate 
this quality to the face of the young girl as he con 
stantly beheld it in his homeward walk. It did not 
defy him or repulse him ; it looked up at him wist 
fully as from the gondola that morning. Neverthe 
less he hardened his heart. The Vervains should 
see him next when they had sent for him. After 
all, one is not so very old at twenty-six. 



X. 

" DON IPPOLITO has come, signorina," said Nina, 
the next morning, approaching Florida, where she 
sat in an attitude of listless patience, in the garden. 

"Don Ippolito!" echoed the young girl in a 
weary tone. She rose and went into the house, and 
they met with the constraint which was but too nat 
ural after the events of their last parting. It is 
hard to tell which has most to overcome in such a 
case, the forgiver or the forgiven. Pardon rankles 
even in a generous soul, and the memory of having 
pardoned embarrasses the sensitive spirit before the 
object of its clemency, humbling and making it 
ashamed. It would be well, I suppose, if there need 
be nothing of the kind between human creatures, 
who cannot sustain such a relation without mutual 
distrust. It is not so ill with them when apart, but 
when they meet they must be cold and shy at first. 

" Now I see what you two are thinking about," 
said Mrs. Vervain, and a faint blush tinged the 
cheek of the priest as she thus paired him off with 
her daughter. " You are thinking about what hap 
pened the other day ; and you had better forget it. 
There is no use brooding over these matters. Dear 
me ! if I had stopped to brood over every little 
unpleasant thing that happened, I wonder where I 



 

should be now ? By the way, where were you all 
day yesterday, Don Ippolito ?" 

 I did not come to disturb you because I thought 
you must be very tired. Besides I was quite busy." 

" Oh yes, those inventions of yours. I think you 
are so ingenious ! But you must n t apply too 
closely. Now really, yesterday, after all you had 
been through, it was too much for the brain." She 
tapped herself on the forehead with her fan. 

" I was not busy with my inventions, madarna," 
answered Don Ippolito, who sat in the womanish 
attitude priests get from their drapery, and fingered 
the cord round his three-cornered hat. " I have 
scarcely touched them of late. But our parish takes 
part in the procession of Corpus Domini in the Pi 
azza, and I had my share of the preparations." 

" Oh, to be sure ! When is it to be ? We must 
all go. Our Nina has been telling Florida of the 
grand sights, little children dressed up like John 
the Baptist, leading lambs. I suppose it's a great 
event with you." 

The priest shrugged his shoulders, and opened 
both his hands, so that his hat slid to the floor, 
bumping and tumbling some distance away. He 
recovered it and sat down again. " It's an observ 
ance," he said coldly. 

" And shall you be in the procession ? " 

" I shall be there with the other priests of my 
parish." 

" Delightful ! " cried Mrs. Vervain. " We shall 



 

be looking out for you. I shall feel greatly honored 
to think I actually know some one in the procession. 
I'm going to give you a little nod. You won 't 
think it very wrong ? " 

She saved him from the embarrassment he might 
have felt in replying, by an abrupt lapse from all 
apparent interest in the subject. She turned to her 
daughter, and said with a querulous accent, u I 
wish you would throw the afghan over my feet, 
Florida, and make me a little comfortable before 
you begin your reading this morning." At the same 
time she feebly disposed herself among the sofa 
cushions on which she reclined, and waited for some 
final touches from her daughter. Then she said, 
" I'm just going to close my eyes, but I shall hear 
every word. You are getting a beautiful accent, 
my dear, I know you are. I should think Goldoni 
must have a very smooth, agreeable style ; has n t 
he now, in Italian ? " 

They began to read the comedy ; after fifteen or 
twenty minutes Mrs. Vervain opened her eyes and 
said, " But before you commence, Florida, I wish 
you d play a little, to get me quieted down. I feel 
so very flighty. I suppose it's this sirocco. And 
I believe I'll lie down in the next room." 

Florida followed her to repeat the arrangements 
for her comfort. Then she returned, and sitting 
down at the piano struck with a sort of soft firmness 
a few low, soothing chords, out of which a lulling 
melody grew. With her fingers still resting on the 



 

keys she turned her stately head, and glanced 
through the open door at her mother. 

" Don Ippolito," she asked softly, " is there any 
thing in the air of Venice that makes people very 
drowsy ? " 

" I have never heard that, madamigella." 

" I wonder," continued the young girl absently, 
" why my mother wants to sleep so much." 

" Perhaps she has not recovered from the fatigues 
of the other night," suggested the priest. 

" Perhaps," said Florida, sadly looking toward 
her mother's door. 

She turned again to the instrument, and let her 
fingers wander over the keys, with a drooping head. 
Presently she lifted her face, and smoothed back 
from her temples some straggling tendrils of hair. 
Without looking at the priest she asked with the 
child-like bluntness that characterized her, " Why 
don 't you like to walk in the procession of Corpus 
Domini?" 

Don Ippolito's color came and went, and he an 
swered evasively, " I have not said that I did not 
like to do so." 

" No, that is true," said Florida, letting her 
fingers drop again on the keys. 

Don Ippolito rose from the sofa where he had 
been sitting beside her while they read, and walked 
the length of the room. Then he came towards her 
and said meekly, " Madamigella, I did not mean to 
repel any interest you feel in me. But it was a 



 

strange question to ask a priest, as I remembered I 
was when you asked it." 

" don 't you always remember that ? " demanded 
the girl, still without turning her head. 

" No ; sometimes I am suffered to forget it," he 
said with a tentative accent. 

She did not respond, and he drew a long breath, 
and walked away in silence. She let her hands fall 
into her lap, and sat in an attitude of expectation. 
As Don Ippolito came near her again he paused a 
second time. 

" It is in this house that I forget my priesthood," 
he began, " and it is the first of your kindnesses 
that you suffer me to do so, your good mother, 
there, and you. How shall I repay you ? It cut 
me to the heart that you should ask forgiveness of 
me when you did, though I was hurt by your 
rebuke. Oh, had you not the right to rebuke me 
if I abused the delicate unreserve with which you 
had always treated me ? But believe me, I meant 
no wrong, then." 

His voice shook, and Florida broke in, " You did 
nothing wrong. It was I who was cruel for no 
cause." 

" No, no. You shall not say that," he returned. 
" And why should I have cared for a few words, 
when all your acts had expressed a trust of me that 
is like heaven to my soul ? " 

She turned now and looked at him, and he went 
on. " Ah, I see you do not understand ! How 



 

could you know what it is to be a priest in this 
most unhappy city ? To be haunted by the strict 
espionage of all your own class, to be shunned as a 
spy by all who are not of it ! But you two have 
not put up that barrier which everywhere shuts me 
out from my kind. You have been willing to see 
the man in me, and to let me forget the priest." 

" I do not know what to say to you, Don Ippolito. 
I am only a foreigner, a girl, and I am very igno- 
rant of these things," said Florida with a slight 
alarm. " I am afraid that you may be saying 
what you will be sorry for." 

" Oh never ! Do not fear for me if I am frank 
with you. It is my refuge from despair." 

The passionate vibration of his voice increased, as 
if it must break in tears. She glanced towards the 
other room with a little movement or stir. 

" Ah, you needn 't be afraid of listening to me ! " 
cried the priest bitterly. 

klgt; I will not wake her," said Florida calmly, after 
an instant. 

" See how you speak the thing you mean, always, 
always, always ! You could not deny that you 
meant to wake her, for you have the life-long habit 
of the truth. Do you know what it is to have the 
life-long habit of a lie ? It is to be a priest. Do 
you know what it is to seem, to say, to do, the 
thing you are not, think not, will not ? To leave 
what you believe unspoken, what you will undon , 
what you are unknown ? It is to be a priest ! " 



 

Don Ippolito spoke in Italian, and he uttered 
these words in a voice carefully guarded from every 
listener but the one before his face. " Do you 
know what it is when such a moment as this comes, 
and you would fling away the whole fabric of false 
hood that has clothed your life do you know what 
it is to keep still so much of it as will help you 
to unmask silently and secretly? It is to be a 
priest ! " 

His voice had lost its vehemence, and his manner 
was strangely subdued and cold. The sort of 
gentle apathy it expressed, together with a certain 
sad, impersonal surprise at the difference between 
his own and the happier fortune with which he con 
trasted it, was more touching than any tragic dem 
onstration. 

As if she felt the fascination of the pathos which 
she could not fully analyze, the young girl sat silent. 
After a time, in which she seemed to be trying to 
think it all out, she asked in a low, deep murmur : 
" Why did you become a priest, then ? " 

" It is a long story," said Don Ippolito. " I will 
not trouble you with it now. Some other time." 

" No ; now," answered Florida, in English. " If 
you hate so to be a priest, I can 't understand why 
you should have allowed yourself to become one. 
We should be very unhappy if we could not respect 

you, not trust you as we have done ; and how 

could we, if we knew you were not true to yourself 
in being what you are ? " 




" Madamigella," said the priest, " I never dared 
believe that I was in the smallest thing necessary to 
your happiness. Is it true, then, that you care for 
my being rather this than that ? That you are in 
the least grieved by any wrong of mine ? " 

" I scarcely know what you mean. How could 
we help being grieved by what you have said to 
me ? " 

"Thanks ; but why do you care whether a priest 
of my church loves his calling or not, you, a Prot 
estant ? It is that you are sorry for me as an un 
happy man, is it not ? " 

" Yes ; it is that and more. I am no Catholic, 
but we are both Christians " 

Don Ippolito gave the faintest movement of his 
shoulders. 

" and I cannot endure to think of your doing 
the tilings you must do as a priest, and yet hating 
to be a priest. It is terrible ! " 

" Are all the priests of your faith devotees ? " 

" They cannot be. But are none of yours so ? " 

" Oh, God forbid that I should say that. I have 
known real saints among them. That friend of 
mine in Padua, of whom I once told you, became 
such, and died an angel fit for Paradise. And I 
suppose that my poor uncle is a saint, too, in his 
way." 

" Your uncle ? A priest ? You have never 
mentioned him. to us." 

" No," said Don Ippolito. After a certain pause 



 

he began abruptly, " We are of the people, my 
family, and in each generation we have sought to 
honor our blood by devoting one of the race to the 
church. When I was a child, I used to divert my 
self by making little figures out of wood and paste 
board, and I drew rude copies of the pictures I saw 
at church. We lived in the house where I live now, 
and where I was born, and my mother let me play 
in the small chamber where I now have my forge ; 
it was anciently the oratory of the noble family 
that occupied the whole palace. I contrived an 
altar at one end of it ; I stuck my pictures about 
the walls, and T ranged the puppets in the order of 
worshippers on the floor ; then I played at saying 
mass, and preached to them all day long. 

" My mother was a widow. She used to watch 
me with tears in her eyes. At last, one day, she 
brought my uncle to see me : I remember it all far 
better than yesterday. " Is it not the will of 
God ? she asked. My uncle called me to him, 
and asked me whether I should like to be a priest 
in good earnest, when I grew up ? Shall I then 
be able to make as many little figures as I like, 
and to paint pictures, and carve an altar like that 
in your church ? I demanded. My uncle an 
swered that I should have real men and women to 
preach to, as he had, and would not that be much 
finer ? In my heart I did not think so, for I did 
not care for that part of it ; I only liked to preach 
to my puppets because I had made them. But I 



 

said,  Oh yes, as children do. I kept on contriving
the toys that I played with, and I grew used to 
hearing it told among my mates and about the 
neighborhood that I was to be a priest ; I cannot 
remember any other talk with my mother, and I do 
not know how or when it was decided. Whenever 
I thought of the matter, I thought, i That will be- 
very well. The priests have very little to do, and 
they gain a great deal of money with their masses ; 
and I shall be able to make whatever I like. I 
only considered the office then as a means to gratify 
the passion that has always filled my soul for inven 
tions and works of mechanical skill and ingenuity. 
My inclination was purely secular, but I was as 
inevitably becoming a priest as if I had been born 
to be one." 

" But you were not forced ? There was no pressure
upon you ? " 

" No, there was merely an absence, so far as they 
were concerned, of any other idea. I think they 
meant justly, and assuredly they meant kindly by 
me. I grew in years, and the time came when I 
was to begin my studies. It was my uncle's influ 
ence that placed me in the Seminary of the Salute, 
and there I repaid his care by the utmost dili 
gence. But it was not the theological studies that 
I loved, it was the n athematics and their practical 
application, and among the classics I loved best the 
poets and the historians. Yes, I can see that I was 
always a mundane spirit, and some of those in 



 

charge of me at once divined it, I think. They 
used to take us to walk, yon have seen the little 
creatures in their priest's gowns, which they put on 
when they enter the school, with a couple of young 
priests at the head of the file, and once, for an 
uncommon pleasure, they took us to the Arsenal, 
and let us see the shipyards and the museum. You 
know the wonderful things that are there : the flags 
and the guns captured from the Turks ; the strange 
weapons of all devices ; the famous suits of armor. 
I came back half-crazed ; I wept that I must leave 
the place. But I set to work the best I could to 
carve out in wood an invention which the model of 
one of the antique galleys had suggested to me. 
They found it, nothing can be concealed outside 
of your own breast in such a school, and they 
carried me with my contrivance before the superior. 
He looked kindly but gravely at me : i My son, 
said he, " do you wish to be a priest ? Surely, 
reverend father, I answered in alarm, why not? 
fc Because these things are not for priests. Their 
thoughts must be upon other things. Consider 
well of it, my son, while there is yet time, he said, 
and he addressed me a long and serious discourse 
upon the life on which I was to enter. He was a 
just and conscientious and affectionate man ; but 
every word fell like burning fire in my heart. At 
the end, he took my poor plaything, and thrust it 
down among the coals of his scaldino. It made the 
scaldino smoke, and he bade me carry it out with 
me, and so turned again to his book. 



 

" My mother was by this time dead, but I could 
hardly have gone to her, if she had still been living. 
These tilings are not for priests ! kept repeating 
itself night and day in my brain. I was in despair, 
I was in a fury to see my uncle. I poured out my 
heart to him, and tried to make him understand 
the illusions and vain hopes in which I had lived. 
He received coldly my sorrow and the reproaches 
which I did not spare him ; he bade me consider 
my inclinations as so many temptations to be over 
come for the good of my soul and the glory of God. 
He warned me against the scandal of attempting 
to withdraw now from the path marked out for me. 
I said that I never would be a priest. And what 
will you do ? he asked. Alas ! what could I do ? 
I went back to my prison, and in due course I be 
came a priest. 

 It was not without sufficient warning that I 
took one order after another, but my uncle's words, 
What will you do ? made me deaf to these ad 
monitions. All that is now past. I no longer re 
sent nor hate ; I seem to have lost the power ; but 
those were days when my soul was filled with bit 
terness. Something of this must have showed it 
self to those who had me in their charge. I have 
heard that at one time my superiors had grave 
doubts whether T ought to be allowed to take orders. 
My examination, in which the difficulties of the 
sacerdotal life were brought before me with the 
greatest clearness, was severe ; I do not know how 



 

I passed it ; it must have been in grace to my 
uncle. I spent the next ten days in a convent, to 
meditate upon the step I was about to take. Poor 
helpless, friendless wretch ! Madamigella, even yet 
I cannot see how I was to blame, that I came forth 
and received the first of the holy orders, and in 
their time the second and the third. 

 I was a priest, but no more a priest at heart 
than those Venetian conscripts, whom you saw 
carried away last week, are Austrian soldiers. I 
was bound as they are bound, by an inexorable 
and inevitable law. 

" You have asked me why I became a priest. 
Perhaps I have not told you why, but I have told 
you how I have given you the slight outward 
events, not the processes of my mind and that 
is all that I can do. If the guilt was mine, I have 
suffered for it. If it was not mine, still I have suf 
fered for it. Some ban seems to have rested upon 
whatever I have attempted. My work, oh. I 
know it well enough ! has all been cursed with 
futility ; my labors are miserable failures or con 
temptible successes. I have had my unselfish 
dreams of blessing mankind by some great dis 
covery or invention ; but my life has been barren, 
barren, barren ; and save for the kindness that I 
have known in this house, and that would not let 
me despair, it would now be without hope." 

He ceased, and the girl, who had listened with 
her proud looks transfigured to an aspect of griev- 



 

ing pity, fetched a long sigh. " Oh, I am sorry for 
you ! " she said, " more sorry than I know how to 
tell. But you must not lose courage, you must not 
give up ! " 

Don Ippolito resumed with a melancholy smile. 
 There are doubtless temptations enough to be 
false under the best of conditions in this world. 
But something I do not know what or whom ; 
perhaps no more my uncle or my mother than I, 
for they were only as the past had made them 
caused me to begin by living a lie, do you not 
see ? " 

" Yes, yes," reluctantly assented the girl. 

"Perhaps who knows ? that is why no good 
has come of me, nor can come. My uncle's piety 
and repute have always been my efficient help. He 
is the principal priest of the church to which I am 
attached, and he has had infinite patience with me. 
My ambition and my attempted inventions are a 
scandal to him, for he is a priest of those like the 
Holy Father, who believe that all the wickedness 
of the modern world has come from the devices of 
science ; my indifference to the things of religion 
is a terror and a sorrow to him which he combats 
with prayers and penances. He starves himself and 
goes cold and faint that God may have mercy and 
turn my heart to the things on which his own is 
fixed. He loves my soul, but not me, and we are 
scarcely friends." 

Florida continued to look at him with steadfast, 


compassionate eyes. It seems very strange, al 
most like some dream," she murmured, "that you 
should be saying all tills to me, Don Ippolito, and 
I do not know why I should have asked you any 
thing." 

The pity of this virginal heart must have been 
very sweet to the man on whom she looked it. His 
eyes worshipped her, as he answered her devoutly, 
" It was due to the truth in you that I should seem 
to you what I am." 

" Indeed, you make me ashamed ! " she cried 
with a blush. " It was selfish of me to ask you to 
speak. And now, after what you have told me, I 
am so helpless and I know so very little that I 
don 't understand how to comfort or encourage you. 
But surely you can somehow help yourself. Are 
men, that seem so strong and able, just as power 
less as women, after all, when it comes to real 
trouble ? Is a man " 

" I cannot answer. I am only a priest," said 
Don Ippolito coldly, letting his eyes drop to the 
gown that fell about him like a woman's skirt. 

"Yes, but a priest should be a man, and so much 
more ; a priest " 

Don Ippolito shrugged his shoulders. 

" No, no ! " cried the girl. " Your own schemes 
have all failed, you say ; then why do you not 
think of becoming a priest in reality, and getting 
the good there must be in such a calling ? It is 
singular that I should venture to say such a thing 



 

to you, and it must seem presumptuous and ridicu 
lous for me, a Protestant but our ways are so 
different." .... She paused, coloring deeply, 
then controlled herself, and added with grave com 
posure,  If you were to pray " 

"To what, madamigella ? " asked the priest, 
sadly. 

" To what ! " she echoed, opening her eyes full 
upon him. " To God ! "
