starve in the midst of civilization. He could 
hardly believe it, and grew half -delirious as he 





thought about it. What would happen at the 
end? Would they let him lie down and die in 
the street? Or was there some place where starv- 
ing men went to die? 

So the day passed, and he found nothing. 
Several people advised him to get out of town — 
this was no place to look for work, they said. Ap- 
parently something was the matter with the place, 
but they did not stop to tell him what. 

This was the first large town Samuel had eveE 
seen, and under other circumstances he would 
have gazed at it with wonder. He passed great 
buildings of brick and stone, and trolley cars, and 
a fire-engine house, and many other strange 
sights. He came to a great high fence, inclos- 
ing many acres of buildings, dingy and black 
with smoke; there were tall chimneys, and rows of 
sheds, and railroad tracks nmning in. He passed 
other factories, huge brick buildings with innu- 
merable windows; and many blocks of working- 
men's houses, small and dirty frame structures, 
with pale-faced children in the doorways. The 
roads and sidewalks here were all of black cinders, 
and it was hot even in May. 

And then he came to a steel bridge and crossed 
a river and the road broadened out, and he 
climbed a hill and found himself walldng upon 
a macadamized avenue lined with trees, and with 
beautiful residences overlooking the ridge. Rich 





people lived here, evidently; and Samuel stared, 
marveling at the splendor. He came to a great 
estate with a stone gateway and iron railings ten 
feet high, and an avenue of stately elm trees; 
there were bright green lawns with peacocks and 
lyre birds strutting about, and a great colonial 
mansion with white pillars in the distance. " Fair- 
view," read the name upon the gates. 

And then again Samuel remembered his ap- 
petite. Surely amid all this luxury there would 
be some chance for him! He started up the path! 

He had got about halfway to the house when 
a man who was tending the flowers caught sight 
of him and came toward him. " What are you 
doing here? " he called, before he had come half- 
way. 
I " I'm looking for some work," began Samuel. 

"Tio you want to get your head punched?" 
shouted the man. " What do you mean by com- 
ing in here? " 

"Why, what's the matter?" asked the I3035 
perplexed. 

" Get out, you loafer! " cried the other. 

And Samuel turned and went quickly. A 
loafer! 

So for the first time it occurred to him to look 
at his clothes, which were muddy from his tumble 
in the ditch. And no doubt his face and hands 
were dirty also, and his hair unkempt, and his 





aspect unprepossessing enough for an applicant 
for labor. At any rate it was clear that this was 
not the part of the town to seek it in; so he went 
back across the bridge. 

Twilight had fallen and the stores were shut- 
ting up. Soon everything would be closed ; and 
that night he felt that he would perish. And so 
at last desperation seized him. 

He bolted into the first lighted place he saw. 

It was a saloon — empty, save for a man in 
white behind the bar. 

" I'm no beggar! " shouted Samuel. 

" Hey? " said the man. 

" I say I'm no beggar! I'll come back and 
pay you. I'm starving. I must have something 
to eat." 

" Gee whiz! " said the man. 

" I was never in a saloon in my life before," 
added Samuel, as he realized the character of the 
place. " But please — please give me sometKing 
to eat." 

" Hully gee, yoimg feller! " exclaimed the bar- 
keeper. " You do it great. You ought to be an 
actor. Step up and feed your face." 

"What?" stammered Samuel, perplexed. 

" Eat! " said the other, and pointed. " Maybe 
you understand that." 

And Samuel turned and saw a lot of food set 
out upon a counter. He rushed to it and began. 





At the jBrst taste a kind of madness seized him, 
and he ate like a wild beast, gulping things. 

For several minutes he did this, while the other 
watched curiously. Then he remarked, " Say, 
you'd better quit." 

"WTiat?" asked Samuel, seizing more food. 

" I say quit," said the man. " Just for your 
own good. I see yoxu* story's true, an' a little 
rest won't hurt you." 

Samuel gazed longingly at the food, desiring 
more handfuls. " Come over here," said the man. 
" What happened to you? " 

" I was locked in an empty freight car." 

"Humph! That's a new one! How long?" 

" What day is this? " 

" Friday." 

" I was locked in Wednesday morning. It 
seemed longer." 

" It's long enough," commented the barkeeper. 

" I was robbed," Samuel went on. " A man 
took all my money." And then the old shame 
started up in him. " Don't think I'm a beggar. 
I'll work and pay for this." 

" That's all right," said the barkeeper. " Be 
easy." 

" Haven't you anything I can do? Some 
wood to split? " 

" We don't bum wood." 

" Or some cleaning up? " Samuel looked round. 





The place did not seem very neat to him. " I'll 
scrub the floors for you," he said. 

" We have 'em scrubbed in the early morning," 
replied the man. 

" Well, let me come and do it," said Samuel. 

" Go on! " said the other. " You'll be ready 
for more feed then." 

" I'll come, just the same, sir." 

" If you take my advice," the bartender ob- 
served, " you'll get out of this town. Lockman- 
ville's a poor place to hunt jobs in." 

Samuel started. " Lockmanville! " he gasped. 

" Yes," said the other. " Don't you know 
where you are? " 

" I didn't know," said the boy. " Lockman- 
ville! The one where the big glass works are? " 

" That's the one." 

" And where old Henry Lockman lived! " 

" What about it? " asked the other. 

" Nothing," said Samuel, " only my father in- 
vested all his money in Lockman's company, and 
lost it." 

" Gee! " said the bartender. 

" Maybe if I told them," said the boy, " they'd 
give me some work here." 

" Maybe," said the other — "only the works is 
shut down." 

" Shut down! " cried Samuel; and then added, 
" On account of his death? " 



" No — they always close in summer. But this 
year they closed in March. Times is bad." 

" Oh," said Samuel. 

" So there's plenty of men looking for jobs in 
Lockmanville," the other continued, " an' some 
of the other factories is closed, too — the cotton 
mill is only runnin' half time." 

" I see." 

" Old Lockman used to say there was too many 
glass works," the barkeeper added. " An' the 
fevers he bought out went an' built more. So 
there you are." 

There was a pause. " I'm coming back in the 
morning," said Samuel doggedly. 

" All right," said the other, with a smile — ' if 
you don't forget it." Then a couple of customers 
entered. " Run along now," said he. 

And Samuel went — the more readily because 
he realized that he had been all this time in a 
saloon, a place of mystery and wickedness to him. 

He started down the street again. A fine cold 
rain had begun to fall. What was he to do? 

He felt warm, having feasted. But there was 
no use in getting wet. He glanced into the door- 
ways as he passed, and seeing a dark and empty 
one, crouched inside. 

Lockmanville I What a curious coincidence! 
And there were hundreds in the town out of work. 
It seemed a strange and terrible thing. Could 





it be that they let people starve as he was starving 
— people they knew? Could it be that they went 
on about their business and paid no attention to 
such a thing? 

He must get out, they told him. But how? 
Would the railroad take him, if he explained? 
Or would the people on the way give him work? 
He had got some food at last, but only by beg- 
ging. And was he expected to beg? 

There came footsteps outside. A man strode 
into the doorway and took hold of the door and 
tried it. Then he turned to go out. Samuel 
moved his foot out of the way. 

" Hello! " said the man. " Who's that? " 

" Only me," said Samuel. 

" Get up there," commanded the other. 

He got up and a hand seized him by the collar. 
" Who are you? " 

He was jerked into the light before he had a 
chance to reply. "More bimis!" growled the 
voice; and Samuel, terrified, saw that he was in 
the grasp of a policeman. 

" Please, sir, I'm not doing any Hann," He be- 
gan. 

" Come," said the policeman. 

"Whereto?" he cried. 

But the other merely jerked him along. A 
sudden wild horror seized Samuel. " You're not 
going to arrest me ! " he exclaimed. 





" Sure," said the other. " Why not? " 

" But," he exclaimed, " I've not done anything. 
I can't help it. I " 

He started to drag hack, and the man twisted 
a huge hand in his collar, choking him. " Do 
you want to be hit? " he growled. 

So Samuel went on. But sobs shook him, con- 
vulsive sobs of terror and despair, and tears of 
shame rolled down his cheeks. He was goiag to 
jail! 

" What's the matter with you? " said the police- 
man after a bit. " Why don't you be quiet? " 

" You've no business to arrest me," wailed the 
boy. " I haven't done anything, and I couldn't 
help it. I've no place to go and no money. And 
it's not my fault." 

" You can tell that to the judge," replied the 
other. 

" But— but what have I done? Why " 

" Shut up ! " said the officer, and gave another 
twist at his throat. And after that Samuel was 
quiet. 



CHAPTER V 

IN the station-house a fat sergeant sat dozing 
upon his throne. "Another vagrant," said 
the policeman, as if to say there was no special 
need to rouse himself. 

" What was he doing? " the sergeant asked. 

" Sleeping in a doorway," was the reply. 

By this time Samuel had come to realize the 
futility of protest. He accepted his fate with 
dumb despair. He gave the information the ser- 
geant asked for — Samuel Prescott, aged seven- 
teen, native born, from Euba Corners, occupation 
farmer, never arrested before. 

" All right," said the man, and went back to 
his nap; and Samuel was led away, and after a 
pretense at a search was shoved into a cell and 
heard the iron door clang upon him. 

He was alone now, and free to sob out his grief. 
It was the culmination of all the shame and hor- 
ror that he could ever have imagined ; first, to have 
to beg, and then to be locked up in jail. He 
Icnew now what they did with men who were out 
of work and starving. 

He lay there weeping, and then suddenly he 
sat up transfixed. From the cell next to him had 


come a cry, a horrible blood-curdling screech, 
more like the scream of a wild cat than any hu- 
man sound. Samuel listened, his heart poimding. 

There came the voice of a man from across the 
corridor — " Shut up, you hag! " And after that 
bedlam broke loose. The woman — Samuel real- 
ized at last that the scream had come from a 
woman — broke forth into a torrent of yells and 
curses. Such hideous obscenities, such revolting 
blasphemies he had never heard in his hf e before 
— he had never dreamed that life contained within 
it the possibility of such depravity. It was like 
an explosion from some loathsome sewer; and its 
source was the lips of a woman. 

For ten minutes or so the tirade continued im- 
til it seemed to the boy that every beautiful and 
sacred thing he had ever heard of in his life had 
been defiled forever. Then a jailer strolled 
down the corridor, and with a few vigorous and 
judicious oaths contrived to quell the uproar. 

Samuel lay down again; and now he had a 
chance to make another discovery. He had felt 
sharp stinging sensations which caused him to 
scratch himself frantically. Then suddenly he 
realized that he was lying upon a mattress in- 
fested with vermin. 

The discovery sent him bounding to the mid- 
dle of the floor. It set him wild with rage. Such 
a thing had never happened to him in his life be- 





fore, for his home was a decent and clean one. 
This was the crowning infamy — that they should 
have taken him, helpless as he was, and shut him 
up in a filthy hole to be devoured by bedbugs and 
lice. 

In the morning they brought him bread and 
coffee ; and after a couple of hours' more waiting 
he was taken to court. 

It was a big bare room with whitewashed walls. 
There were a few scattered spectators, a couple 
of policemen and several men writing at tables. 
Seated within an inclosure were a number of 
prisoners, dull and listless looking. One by one 
they stepped up before the railing and faced the 
judge ; there would be a few muttered words and 
they would move on. Everything went as a mat- 
ter of routine, which had been going that way for 
ages. The judge, who was elderly and gray 
haired, looked like a prosperous business man in 
a masquerade costume. 

Samuel's turn came and he stood before the 
bar. His name was read, and the charge — 
vagrancy. 

" Well? " said the judge mechanically. 
" What have you to say for yourself? " 

Samuel caught his breath. " It's not my fault, 
sir," he began. 

" Your honor," prompted the policeman who 
stood at his elbow. 





" Your honor," said Samuel, " I lost all my 
money. And I've been trying to find work, yoiur 
honor." 

" Have you any friends in town? " 

" No, your honor." 

" How long have you been here? " 

" Only since yesterday, your honor." 

" How did you get here? " 

" I came in on a freight train, your honor." 

" I see," said the judge. " Well, you came to 
the wrong place. We're going to put an end to 
vagrancy in Lockmanville. Thirty days. Next 
case." 

Samuel caught his breath. " Your honor," he 
gasped. 

" Next case," repeated the judge. 

The pohceman started to lead Samuel away. 
" Your honor," he cried frantically. " Don't 
send me to jail." And fighting against the po- 
hceman's grip, he rushed on, " It's not my fault 
— I'm an honest boy and I tried to find work. 
I haven't done anything. And you'll kill me 
if you send me to jail. Have mercy! Have 
mercy! " 

The policeman shook him roughly. But there 
was something so genuine in Samuel's wail that 
the judge said, " Wait." 

" How could I help it if I was robbed? " the 
boy rushed on, taking advantage of his chance. 





" And what covJd I do but ask for work? I was 
brought up honest, your honor. It would have 
killed my father if he'd thought I'd be sent to 
jail. He brought me up to earn my living." 

" Who was your father? " asked the judge. 

" His name was Ephraim Prescott, and he was 
a farmer. You can ask anyone at Euba Comers 
what sort of a man he was. He'd fought all 
through the war — he was wounded four times. 
And if he could be here he'd tell you that I don't 
deserve to go to jail." 

There was a moment's pause. "What regi- 
ment was your father in? " asked the magistrate. 

"He was in the Seventeenth Pennsylvania, 
your honor." 

"Be careful, boy," said the other sternly. 
" Don't try to deceive me." 

" I don't want to deceive you, your honor," 
protested Samuel. 

" What brigade was the Seventeenth Pennsyl- 
vania m? 

" In the Third Brigade, your honor." 

" And who commanded it? " 

" General Anderson — that is, vmtil he was 
killed at the battle of Chancellorsville. My 
father was there." 

" I was there, too," said the judge. 

" My father used to tell me about it," exclaimed 
Samuel with sudden eagerness. "His brigade 





was in the right wing and they ha'd a double line 
of trenches. And the rebels charged the line with 
cavalry. They charged a dozen times during the 
day, and there were big trees cut down by the 
bullets. My father said the rebels never fought 
harder than they did right there." 

" Yes," said his honor, " I know. I was one 
of them." 

Everyone within hearing laughed; and Samuel 
turned crimson. 

" I beg pardon, yom* honor," he said. 

" That's all right," said the judge. And then 
he added gravely, " Very well, Samuel, we'll 
give you another chance for your father's sake. 
But don't let me see you here again." 

" No, your honor," said Samuel. Then he 
added quickly. " But what can I do? " 

" Get out of Lockmanville," said the other. 

" But how? When I've no money. If your 
honor could only help me to some work." 

" No," said the judge. " I'm sorry, but I've 
found jobs for three men this week, and I don't 
know any more." 

" But then — " began Samuel. 

" I'll give you a dollar out of my own pocket," 
the other added. 

" Your honor," cried Samuel startled, " I don't 
want to take money ! " 

" You can send it back to me when you get a 





job," said the judge, holding out a bill. *' Take 
it. Prisoner discharged. Next case." 

Samuel took the money and was turning away, 
when a man who had been sitting in a chair near 
the magistrate suddenly leaned forward. 

" Judge," he said, " if I may interrupt " 

" Why, surely, professor," said the other pleas- 
antly. 

" I may possibly be able to find something for 
the boy to do." 

" Ah, that will be fine! " 

" He seems to be a capable young fellow and 
might be worth helping." 

" The very thing, professor. Samuel, this is 
Professor Stewart, of Lockman College." 

Samuel was very glad to meet the professor. 
He was a trim little gentleman, with a carefully 
cut black beard and gold-rimmed eyeglasses. 

"Here is my card," he said; "and if you'll 
come to see me to-morrow morning at my house, 
we'll see what we can do." 

" Thank you very much," said the boy, and put 
the card in his pocket. Then, realizing suddenly 
that the pohceman had let go of his arm, and 
that he was free, he turned and made his way 
through the gate. 

" A diverting episode," said the professor. 

" Yes," said the judge, with a smile. " We 
have them now and then, you see." 





Samuel went out with a glow in his heart. At 
last he had got a start. He had got underneath 
the world's tough hide and found kindness and 
humanity after all. It had been a harrowing 
experience, but it would not happen again. 

He had now one definite purpose in mind. He 
walked straight out of town and down the river 
road unty, he came to a sufficiently solitary place. 
Then he took off his clothes and sat down on the 
bank and performed a most elaborate toilet. For 
half an hour at least he scrubbed his head with 
sand and water, and combed his hair out with his 
fingers. And then he went over his clothing 
inch by inch. At least he would be through with 
one hideous reminder of his imprisonment. 

After which he dressed again and went back 
to town and found the saloon where he had eaten. 

"Hello!" said his friend Finnegan, the bar- 
keeper. " Back again! " 

" I came to explain about this morning," said 
Samuel. " I couldn't come because they put me 
in jail." 

" Gee I " said the other; but then he added, with 
a laugh, " Well, it was a wet night." 

Samuel did not reply. " I'll come to-morrow 
morning," he said. 

" You'd better get out of town, sonny," advised 
the other. 

" I'm all right. The judge gave me a dollar." 





" Hximph! A dollar won't last forever." 

" No. But I've got the promise of a job. 
There was a gentleman there — Professor Stewart, 
from the college." 

" Hully gee! " said Finnegan. " I know that 
guy. A little runt with a black beard? " 

" I guess so," said Samuel dubiously. 

" I seen his pitcher in the paper," said the 
other. " He's one of them reformers — always 
messin' into things." 

" Maybe that's why he was at the court," ob- 
served Samuel. 

" Sure thing! He's a perfessor of sociology 
an' such things, an' he thinks he knows all about 
politics. But we handed him a few last election 
 — just you bet! " 

" Who's ' we '? " asked Samuel. 

"The organization," said Finnegan; "the 
Democrats, o' course. Them reformers is always 
Republicans — the * better element,' an' all that. 
That means the rich guys — that have their own 
little grafts to work. This perfessor was a great 
friend of old Henry Lockman — an' the old man 
used to run this town with his little finger. But 
they had a big strike here three years ago, and 
too many men got hit over the head. So it'll be 
a long day before there's any more ' reform ' in 
Lockmanville." 

" I see," said Samuel. 





" They make a great howl about the saloons 
an' all the rest," added the barkeeper. " But 
when the Republicans ran things, my boss paid his 
little rake-off just the same, you can bet. But 
you needn't tell that to the perfessor." 

" I won't," said the boy. 

" What you goin' to do now? " asked the other, 

" I don't know. I guess I'll have to get some- 
thing to eat first." 

" You'll find the cheapest way is to buy a glass 
of beer and then feed over there." 

" No," said Samuel, startled. " I— I think I'd 
rather not do that." 

" Well, so long," said Finnegan, with a laugh. 

"You'll see me to-morrow morning," said 
Samuel, as he went out. 



CHAPTER VI 

SAMUEL went to a bake shop and bought a 
loaf of bread and sat on the bench of the 
pubhc square and devoured it bit by bit. It was 
the cheapest thing he could think of, and quantity 
was what counted just then. 

Next he had to find a room to spend the night. 
He knew nothing about hotels and lodging- 
houses — he walked through the workingmen's 
quarter of the town, scanning the cottages hesi- 
tatingly. At last in the doorway of one he no- 
ticed a woman standing, an elderly woman, very 
thin and weary looking, but clean, and with a 
kindly face. So he stopped. 

" Please," said he, " could you tell me any 
place where I could hire a room? " 

The woman looked at him. " For how long? " 
she asked. 

" I'm not quite sure," he said. " I want it for 
one night, and then if I get a job, I may want 
it longer." 

" A job in Lockmanville? " said the woman. 

" Well, I've the promise of one," he replied. 

" There can't be very many," said she. " I've 
two rooms I've always rented," she added, " but 


when the glass works shut down the men went 
away. One of them owed me three dollars, too." 

" I — I'm not able to pay very much," said 
Samuel. 

" Come in," responded the woman; and he sat 
down and told her his story. And she told him 
hers. 

Mrs. Stedman was her name, and her husband 
had been a glass blower. He earned good wages 
— five dollars a day in the busy season. But he 
worked in front of a huge tank of white-hot glass 
and that was hard on a man. And once on a hot 
day he had gone suddenly dizzy, and fallen upon 
a mass of hot slag, and been frightfully burned 
in the face. They had carried him to the hospital 
and taken out one eye. And then, because of his 
family and the end of the season being near, he 
had gone to work too soon, and his wotmd had 
gone bad, and in the end he had died of blood- 
poisoning. 

" That was two years ago," said Mrs. Sted- 
man. " And I got no damages. We've barely, 
got along — this year's been worse than ever. It's 
the panic, they say. It seemed as if everything 
was shutting down." 

" It must be very hard on people here," said 
Samuel. 

" I've got three children — all girls," said Mrs. 
Stedman, " and only one old enough to work. 





That's Sophie — she's in the cotton mill, and that 
only started again last month. And they say it 
may run on half time all the year. I do sewing 
and whatever I can to help, but there's never 
enough." 

Samuel forgot his own troubles in talking with' 
this woman. His family had been poor on the 
farm, but they had never known such poverty 
as this. And here were whole streets full of peo- 
ple living the same sort of life; hanging over the 
abyss of destruction, and with no prospect save 
to struggle forever. Mrs. Stedman talked cas- 
ually about her friends and neighbors, and new 
glimpses came to make the boy catch his breath. 
Next door was Mrs. Prosser, whose husband was 
dying of cancer; he had been two years dying, 
and they had five small children. And on the 
other side were the Rapinskys, a Polish family; 
they had been strong in the possession of three 
grown sons, and had even bought a phonograph. 
And now not one of them had done a stroke of 
work for three months. 

To have been robbed and put in jail seemed a 
mere incident in comparison with such bitter and 
lifelong suffering; and Samuel was ashamed of 
having made so much fuss. He had stated, with 
some trepidation, that he was just out of jail; but 
Mrs. Stedman had not seemed to mind that. Her 
husband had been in jail once, during the big 





glass strike, and for nothing more than begging 
another man not to take his job. 

It was arranged that Samuel was to pay Her 
thirty-five cents for his supper and bed and break- 
fast, and if he wished to stay longer she would 
board him for four dollars a week, or he mighlj 
have the room alone for a dollar. 

The two younger children came in from school; 
they were frail and undersized httle girls, with 
clothing that was neatly but pitifully patched. 
And shortly after them came Sophie. 

Samuel gave a start of dismay when he saw 
her. He had been told that she worked in the 
cotton mill and was the mainstay of the family; 
and he had pictured a stiu-dy young woman, such 
as he had seen at home. Instead, here was a frail 
shp of a child, scarcely larger than the others. 
Sophie was thirteen, as he learned afterwards; but 
she did not look to be ten by his standards. She 
was grave and deliberate in her movements, and 
she gazed at the stranger with a pair of very big 
brown eyes. 

" This is Samuel Prescott," said her mother. 
" He is going to spend the night, and maybe 
board with us." 

" How do you do? " said Sophie, and took off 
the shawl from her head and sat down in a corner.
