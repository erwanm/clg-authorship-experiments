'I don't believe Arthur is a good witness, Prim,' said Rollo. 'His 
testimony gets confused. Does he ever go walking in his sleep in 
these daysnights, I mean?'

'I was awake then,' said Dr. Arthur. 'And why you women don't put 
that thing down!'

'Arthur!' said Prim, half laughing but half fearful too, 'it's rather 
hard on the people who don't go, to tell them they ought to put a 
stop to it; and the people who do go, some of them, do it very 
innocently.'

'Yes!' said Dr. Arthur, 'and any man who takes such a young, pure 
face into the whirligig ought to be shot!'

'I daresay she'll marry Sir Henry Crofton,' said Mrs. Coles.

But Rollo did not seem terrified, and did not seem to pay much 
attention to the whole thing, she thought. He was rather silent the 
rest of the dinner; but so he had been the former part of it, ever 
since Dr. Arthur had come home to talk. To Prudentia he never 
said more words than were civilly necessary. As soon as dinner 
was over he mounted and rode away.


CHAPTER II.

WHAT COMES OF ON-DIT.


Wych Hazel had not wanted to come home. But neither did she at 
all wish to arouse Mr. Falkirk's suspicions by a too strenuous 
resistance; and besides, when he really made up his mind to a 
thing, she had to yield; so, with much secret trepidation, and a 
particularly wayward outside development, she made the journey; 
and late the next night after Dr. Arthur's revelations, laid her head 
on the pillows on her own room at Chickaree, with a strange little 
feeling of gladness, that half began to take the trepidation in hand. 
Wellit was not the end of September yet: she would have a little 
breathing space. And thenWych Hazel dropped asleep.

Things 'happen,' as we say, strangely sometimes. Threads which 
should lie smooth and straight alongside of each other and make 
no confusion, get all snarled, and twisted, and thrown crosswise of 
each other by just a little breeze of influence, or some slight 
impulse on one side. And so it fell next day.

Mrs. Powder, who had also been at Newport, and left it three days 
before Wych Hazel, had engaged her and Mr. Falkirk to lunch for 
this very day, the next after their arrival. That was one thread, not 
necessarily touching, one would say, the grand event of the day, 
which was Rollo's coming and visit at Chickaree. For that visit was 
to have been made right early in the morning, and Collingwood 
was ordered, and even mounted, when there came a message from 
the mills. Some complication or accident of business made the 
master's presence necessary. Rollo went to the Hollow, and stayed 
there till he had but just time left to get to Chickaree before 
luncheon. This thread was twisted.

The carriage at the door. Rollo threw himself off his horse and 
went in. He was too late. Just within the door he met the little lady 
he came to see, standing in her pretty draperies of mantle and veil, 
ready for her drive; and Mr. Falkirk was behind her.


'O Mr. Rollo!' she said (fortified with this last fact) 'you have come 
for lunch!'

'Have I?' said he, as he took her hand in the old-fashioned way. 'I 
see I shall not get it.'

'Will getting it to-morrow help you to dispense with it to-day? We 
are engaged at Mrs. Powder's. You see I must go.'

'I see you must go. I have been delayed.'

Mr. Falkirk, according to his accustomed tactics, passed out upon 
the veranda after giving his own greeting, leaving the others alone. 
Rollo had come with a face flushed with pleasure and riding; now 
a certain shade fell upon it; his brow grew grave, as if with sudden 
thought.

'I will not detain you,' he said, after seeing that Mr. Falkirk was at 
a safe distance; 'only let me ask one question. Arthur Maryland 
says he saw you waltzing with that English Crofton. I know it is 
not true; but tell me so, that I may contradict him. He was 
mistaken.'

'Dr. Arthur! was he there?' voice and face too shewed a sudden 
check.

'But he did not see that?' said Rollo, with eyes which seemed as if 
they would deny the fact by sheer force of will.

Her eyes had no more than glanced at him hitherto, shyly 
withholding themselves. But now they looked full into his face, 
using the old, wistful, girlish right of search; watching him as 
keenly as sometimes he watched her. She answered gravely:

'How could Dr. Arthur be mistaken in what he says he saw?'

'Is it true?' came with an astonished, fiery glance of the gray eyes. 
She draw herself up a little, stepping back.

'It is truesince he says sothat he saw me among the rest.'

It is not often that we see a man lose colour from intense feeling. 
Wych Hazel's eyes saw it now. Rollo stood still before her, quite 
still, for a space of time that neither could measure, growing very 
pale, while at the same time the lines on lip and brow gradually 
took a firmer and firmer set. Motionless as an iron statue, and 
assuming more and more the fixedness of one, he stood, while 
minute after minute slipped by. To Wych Hazel the time probably 
seemed measureless and endless; while to Rollo, in the struggle 
and tumultuous whirl of feeling, it was only a single sharp point of 
existence. He stood with his eyes cast down; and without raising 
them, without uttering another syllable, for which I suppose he had 
not self-control, at last he bowed gravely and low, and turned 
away. In another minute, the bay horse and his rider went past the 
door and were gone.

On her part, Wych Hazel had stood waiting, expecting him to 
speak, scanning his face with eager scrutiny. Then, with a grave 
shadow of disappointment upon her own, looked down again, 
nerving herself for the words of anger which must follow such a 
look. But when he turned, she raised her head quickly and looked 
after him, following with her eyes as long as eyes could follow, 
listening as long as ears could hearthen drew her veil over her 
face and went down and entered the carriage. Answering, 
somehow, Mr. Falkirk's words; and, somehow, taking her part in 
Mrs. Powder's festivities.

O the interminable length of those bridges from life-point to life-
point, over which we must sometimes pass at a foot-pace! Is 
anything more intolerable than the monotonous tramp, tramp, of 
the meaningless steps? Is anything more sickening than the easy 
sway of the bridge, which seems to make the whole world reel, 
while in truth it is only ourselves? If Wych Hazel had been asked 
afterwards who was at Mrs. Powder's, and what was said, and 
when she came home, she could not have told a word. She came 
home with a scarlet spot on either cheek, burning brighter and 
brighter. They were very beautiful, people said.

But to-morrow he would come, when his anger was cooled down. 
What if he did?for pain this time had used a trident. He had 
doubted her. Then he could doubt her! Then, he never could trust. 
And what was anything after that? Not her discretion merely, as 
before; not her obedience; but her word! Well, he would come, and 
she would tell himthat would be one little shred of comfort, at 
least. But he had looked at her so! and thenhe had turned his 
eyes away. And no matter what she told him, or what he might 
believe then, that look had gone down to the depths of her heart. 
He had doubted her!

Well, the night wore away, somehow, between bitter waking pain 
and snatches of exhausted sleep; and then the morningas 
mornings sometimes willseemed to speak comfort. He would 
come, and she would tell him.

But he did not come. And one day followed another, and still there 
came not even a message; and Wych Hazel waited. No one 
guessed how little she eat in those days, no one guessed how little 
she slept; the one thing she knew of herself was, that no earthly 
temptation could have made her leave the house for five minutes. 
She rose up earlyfor he might come then; and she sat up till 
impossible hours, lest they might be the only ones left free by 
business. But under all this watching, the keen, three-pointed pain 
never relaxed its pressure. What was the use of anything, after 
that? and yet she longed for his coming with an intensity that could 
not be measured.

Earlier in the year,certainly before his declaration,she would 
not have waited so long, without taking the matter into her own 
hands and writing. But the twenty-fifth was close at hand; how 
could she do anything to bring herself to his notice, or call him to 
her side? And he was almost a stranger now; she had seen him but 
once since near a year ago. And on the twenty-fifth, at least, she 
must see him. Alas! what could she say to him then? unless
that. But she could not think of it now. Her mind clasped hold of 
just one thought: he will come then. 'He wants me to understand 
how angry he is,' thought Hazel to herself as the tenth day crept 
slowly by. 'Does he think I am made of iron, like himself, I 
wonder?'

And so we judge and misjudge each other, the best of us; and how 
can we help it? Misjudgments will be, must be; the only thing left 
to human finiteness and short-sightedness is frank dealing. There 
is one possible remedy in that.

Rollo did not come to Chickaree, and he did not write. How long 
Wych could have borne to wait without herself writing, to clear 
herself, it is difficult to say. A week passed, the second week was 
in progress, the twenty-fifth was not more than a week off, when 
Mr. Falkirk announced at dinner one day that Rollo was just 
setting off upon a journey.

'He's going to see some great manufacturing establishment in the 
northeast somewhere, and can't attend to my business, he tells me, 
before the fifth or sixth of next month; he hopes to be back by that 
time.'

Mr. Falkirk thought the non-intercourse between the Hollow and 
Chickaree a very significant fact; but it was not his plan to annoy 
his ward by seeming to see anything it was not necessary he 
should see. It cannot be said that he was quite satisfied with the 
condition of things, indeed; however, he knew it was hopeless to 
attack Wych Hazel in the hope of getting information; and with 
what patience he might, he waited too; the third in that unrestful 
attitude.

With that strange double life which she had been leading of late, 
Wych Hazel heard Mr. Falkirk's announcement and poured out his 
'after-dinner coffee' with a steady hand. Then asked when Mr. 
Rollo was to go. He had gone already, that very day. And till when 
must this other business wait? Till the second week in October. 
Then she knew that he had thrown her off. No other earthly thing 
would have kept him away on the twenty-fifth, without even a 
word. Could he have done it, unless his liking for her had 
changed? Would he have done it, caring for her asshe thought
he had cared a year ago? With these questions beating back and 
forth in her mind,so she went though the rest of the day. 
Receiving visiters, giving Mr. Falkirk his tea, sitting with him 
through the evening; until, at last, it was done and he had gone, 
and she could be alone. It never even crossed her mind to go to bed 
that night.

Whatever the new day may do with things that are sure, it is yet 
rather gentle with uncertainties; making fair little suggestions, and 
giving stray touches of light, in a way that is altogether hopeful 
and beguiling. And so, when that weary moonlight night had spent 
its glitter, and the tender dawn came up, Hazel breathed free over a 
new thought. Mr. Falkirk might be mistaken! His own business 
might fill Mr. Rollo's hands until the second week in October,
that word proved nothing at all about his staying away. She would 
wait and see. No use in trusting people just while you can keep 
watch. And so, though the secret pain at her heart did never 
disappear, and though at best her next meeting with Mr. Rollo 
could not be very pleasant, still Hazel did hold up her head, and 
hope, and wait, with a woman's ready faith, and a courage that died 
out in the twilight and revived in the dawn, and kept her in a fever 
of suspense and expectation. It wearied her so unspeakably, in the 
long hours of practical daylight and unmanageable night, that 
sometimes she could hardly bear it. The world seemed to turn 
round till she could not catch her thoughts; and nerves overstrung 
and on the watch, made her start and grow pale with the 
commonest little sounds of every day and every night.

She had never had many people to love; she had never (before) 
loved anybody very much; and the truth and dignity which had 
kept her from all forms of love-trifling, so kept the hidden 
treasures of her heart all sparkling with their own freshness. They 
had never been passed about from hand to hand; no weather-stains, 
no worn-out impressions were there. What the amount might be, 
Wych Hazel had never guessed until in these dark days she began 
to tell it over; making herself feel so poor! For, after all, what is 
the use of a treasure which nobody wants?

Not the least among her troubles was the painful hiding them all. 
She must laugh and talk and entertain Mr. Falkirk; she must guard 
her face when the mail-bag came in, and steady the little hand 
stretched out for her letters; must meet and turn off all Mrs. 
Bywank's looks and words; must dress and go out, and dress and 
receive people at home. Ah, how hard it was!and no one to 
whom she could speak, no lap where she could lay down her head, 
and pour out her sorrows.

Slowly, as the days went by, and hope grew fainter, and the dawn 
turned cold, there grew up in Wych Hazel's mind an intense 
longing to lay hold of something that was still; something that 
would stand; something beyond the wind and above the waves; 
and slowly, gradually, the words she had read to Gyda came back, 
and made themselves a power in her mind:


"I will be with him in trouble."


Oh for some one to be with her! Oh for something she could grasp, 
and stop this endless swaying and rocking and trembling of all 
things else! And then, following close, came other words, more 
lately learned. Not now read over, with those pencil marks beside 
them; but read often enough before, happily, to have been learned 
by heart; and now passing and re-passing in unceasing procession 
before her thoughts.


"For the love of Christ constraineth us."


The love that could be counted on; the Presence that was sure!

And so, reaching her hands out blindly through the dark, the girl 
did now and then lay hold of the Eternal strength, and for a while 
sometimes found rest. But there came other days and hours when 
she seemed to be clinging to she hardly knew what, with the full 
rush and sweeping of the tide around her; conscious only that she 
was not quite swept away; until when at last the twenty-third was 
past, and three days of grace had followed suit, Hazel rose up one 
morning with this one thought: if she did not see somebody to 
speak to, she should die.


CHAPTER III.

CROSS THREADS.


And in all the world there was but one person to whom she could 
speak, for but one had guessed her secret; even Gyda. It seemed to 
the girl afterwards as if at this time again her mother's prayers 
must have been around her; so clear and swift and instinctive were 
her decisions, in the chaos of all other things. No danger now of 
meeting any one at the cottage. But how to get there? Not through 
Morton Hollow, not on Jeannie Deans,oh no, oh no! If she went, 
she must go by that other almost impossible way, which was not a 
way. She would drive to the foot of the hill, and leave the carriage 
there, and not take Lewis to see where she went.

How she did it, Hazel never remembered afterwards. She left the 
carriage with a cheery word to Reo, and then set her face to the 
hill; the little feet toiling on with swift eagerness through briers 
and over stones, finding her way she knew not how; conscious 
only that she did not feel the ground under her feet, but seemed to 
be walking on nothing, so that she had every now and then a sort 
of fear of pitching forward. She had set out in good season, but it 
was past midday when she stood before the cottage. If she knocked 
as no other hand had ever knocked there; if her face at the opening 
door startled Gyda beyond words; of this, too, the girl knew 
nothing. For with the first sight of Gyda, there came such a surge 
of the sorrows in which she was plunged, that Hazel stepped one 
step within the door and dropped all unconscious at the old 
Norsewoman's feet.

Gyda was quite unable to lift her, light as the burden would have 
been; but what she could she was prompt and skilful to do. She 
brought cushions to put under Wych Hazel's head, applied cold 
water and hartshorn; for Gyda was too much in request as a village 
nurse and doctor to be unsupplied with simple remedies. With 
tender care she used what she had, till the girl opened her eyes and 
found Gyda's brown face hovering over her. Even then the old 
woman said not a word. She waited till Wych Hazel's senses were 
clear, and the young lady had roused herself up to a sitting position 
on the floor. Gyda's eyes were too keen not to see that the mind 
was more disturbed than the body.

'My little lady,' she said wistfully, 'what ails thee?'

Hazel passed her hands over her face, and tried to collect her 
thoughts.

'I am a great deal of trouble,'she said slowly; for the touch of the 
wet hair was suggestive, and it seemed to her just then that she was 
nothing but trouble to anybody.

'And what is it that is troubling thee?' said Gyda, stooping down 
with her hand on Wych Hazel's shoulder, the wrinkled, sweet old 
face looking earnestly for the answer.

'How can you set things right?' said Hazel, with her usual inroad to 
the midst of the case. 'How can you set them right, when you do 
not know where they are wrong?'

'Will my lady tell me what is wrong?' said the old woman, 
probably judging this statement of the position too vague to be 
acted upon. 'But come and sit down, and see the fire, and get 
comfortable; and tell me; and then we'll know.'

Wych Hazel rose and came to the fire as she was bid, and looked 
at it, seeing nothing; but her next words touched another point.

'Why do such things come upon people?' she said.

The old Norsewoman stood beside her, watching with all the 
wisdom of her loving, wise heart to see where the hurt was and 
what the medicine must be. She put her hand again upon Wych 
Hazel's shoulder as she looked.

'What has come?' she said. 'It's notmy lad?' she added, with 
evidently a sudden startle of apprehension.

'He is away, you know,' said Hazel, with an immediate reserve of 
voice. 'I know nothing of him.'

'What has come to my lad's lady?'

A quick spasm of pain passed over the face she was watching. 
'Hush!' the girl said under her breadth. 'I am not that.'

'Then something wants to be set right,' said the old woman quietly. 
'What is it, dear? Tell me, and the Lord will shew us how to do.'

'If He cared, he would have hindered,' said Hazel drearily.

'He doesn't hinder, sometimes, to shew us that he cares,' said Gyda. 
'You may not question his love, dear; you'll be sure to get wrong if 
you do.' And then bending nearer, so as to look close in the girl's 
face, with her little black eyes shining both keen and tender, she 
repeated, 'My lad's lady, what is it? I am his servant, and so I am 
her servant.'

If anything could have broken down the fierce self-control in 
which Hazel had been entrenched for the last ten days, it was 
perhaps the repetition of those words. But tears were biding their 
time; none had come, none could come yet. Only her lips 
trembled.

'Please, please!' she said, raising her hand in mute pleading. Then 
adding, in a tone that went to Gyda's heart, 'He has doubted my 
word. There is nothing to be done.'

'My lad? Olaf?'

'Yes.'

'It seems ye've doubted him. Is that it?'

'His truth? Never.'

'Nein, not his truth. But you have doubted him, yet. What cause 
had he to doubt your word?'

'Appearances. They were all against me. But there is no use in 
trusting, unless you trust.'

'Has Olaf done you wrong, you think, and no cause?'

'I did not come to complain of him,' said the girl quickly. 'ButI 
had nobody to speak toand I wasdying by inches.'

'Suppose you complain, dear,' said the old woman, with a smile 
which was anything but unsympathetic. 'Complain, and make the 
worst of it; then we will know how to begin. Say all he has done, 
as bad as it is, and we will see what it means, maybe.'

The wistful eyes looked up at her, then down again. She answered 
softly:

'He thought, he had reason to think, that I had broken my promise. 
And he did not wait, nor try, for an explanation. That is one thing.'

'How could he have reason to think that, my lady?'

'Because of something I could not help,' said Hazel. 'You know 
that can be,' she added with an appealing look, as if to see whether 
Gyda doubted her too.

'Did you speak to him?'

'He gave me no chance. I have not seen him sincesincehe 
looked at me so,' said Hazel.

'Maybe he had his own part to bear,' said the old woman. 'But Olaf 
will be back again in a few days.'

'Yes,'said the girl slowly,'that makes no difference. He has 
given me up.'

'Love doesn't give up,' said Gyda. 'He asked me, a few days ago, to 
pray for him, that he might be strong to do right. I wot, it'll be an 
easier part then he thought of!'

But the words touched a sore spot. 'No,' the girl thought to herself. 
'Love does not give up!' She sat very white and still. Then, after a 
while, looked up at Gydaone of her fair looks.

'You did not know,' she said gently, 'that he was asking you to pray 
against me.'

Gyda met her eyes, first without replying; her hand left Wych 
Hazel's shoulder and came upon her hair, touching it softly. That 
old, brown, wrinkled face was so sweet and quiet that it seemed a 
very stronghold of comfort and counsel and help. Counsel and 
comfort came in a very simple form this time.

'Dear,' she said, in her slow utterance,'he loves you.'

But Hazel was not inclined to debate that question with anybody 
but herself. She leaned her head back and shut her eyes, finding 
curious soothing in the touch of Gyda's hand. Nobody ever 
touched her so in these days, and she had been very, very lonely. 
Then suddenly she started up, sitting forward and speaking 
eagerly.

'You must not tell him!' she said; 'you must not even tell him that I 
have been here. You must not say one word. Promise me!'

'Till you tell him?' said Gyda placidly.

'Will you promise?' Hazel repeated. 'Things that cannot stand of 
themselves had betterfall.'

'What is it that cannot stand, dear?'

'I did not come here to talk about that,' said Hazel, laying her head 
back again. 'I came to talk about myself. Or to do something, 
besides think.'

'I'll hear,' said Gyda. 'Nothing's going to fall that ought to stand. 
Talk, my dear.'

All the while she was standing just at Wych Hazel's shoulder, 
touching her head with a slight touch; in her face and voice the 
utmost soothing charm of tender tranquillity. She had been 
doubtless a Norwegian peasant woman, and had known little of 
what we call refining advantages in outward things; but love and 
peace and sympathy had made her wonderfully delicate and quick 
to divine the needs of those with whom she dealt. It was a hard 
little hand, but a very soft touch upon Wych Hazel's curls. 
Furthermore, it was evident, that beyond her sympathy with her 
visiter's present distress, Gyda was not disturbed about the matter 
in hand.

'The days have been so long, all these weeks,' said Hazel. 'And the 
nights were longer than the days.'

'Ah, yes. And you couldn't trust the Lord with your trouble?'

'I thinkI did try, sometimes,' said the girl slowly, 'but I do not 
quite know. I was in such confusion, and other things came in, and 
I was afraid of doing itonly to please him, because'

'Eh,' said Gyda. 'Yes, to please who, dear?'

Hazel put up one little hand and laid it upon Gyda's, so giving her 
answer.

'Because,' she began again presently, 'I had thoughtit had 
seemed as ifmaybethat was the reason of it all. Do such things 
come upon people for doing wrong things, when they do not know 
they are wrong?'

'Mayhap,' said Gyda, who through the obscurities of this speech 
threaded her way to one thing only. 'It's only the straight way, 
dear, that has no crooks in it. But seeisn't my lad's lady in the 
straight way?'

'But I meanI do not know how to tell you,' she said, covering her 
face with her hands. 'When he had grown so goodand I had 
not,I thought, perhaps, that was the reason. I thought of it last 
winter, before this came; and I have never seen him sincebut 
once. I might seemdifferentto him, you know,' Hazel added, 
in her girlish way. Then she took her hands down and looked at 
Gyda, searching for her answer. But Gyda gently smiled.

'I think you'll soon know,' she said. 'Suppose you don't think any 
more about it, till he comes.'

Hazel was silent a few minutes, but thinking all the while as hard 
as she could. She was in no hurry now for Mr. Rollo to come; her 
dread of seeing him again was extreme. And by this time another 
matter claimed her attention, over and above everything else; she 
must get home while she could. If physical prostration and reaction 
went on at the rate they had begun, it would not take much longer 
to make the scramble over the hill a sheer impossibility.

'I must go,' she said abruptly. 'But you will let me come once 
more?'

Gyda was about to answer, when she turned her head sharply 
towards the door. Her ears caught a sound in that direction, and the 
next instant Wych Hazel's ears caught it too; the sound of steps, 
quick steps, a man's steps, coming along the flag-stones outside the 
cottage. A hand on the door, the door open, and Rollo himself was 
there.


CHAPTER IV.

ABOUT THE GUARDIANSHIP.


He came in with the same quick, energetic footstep, looking grave, 
certainly, but brown and ruddy, like a man with all his forces about 
him, and with a bright greeting ready for Gyda. And then his face 
changed suddenly, and his manner. He came up to Wych Hazels 
side, bent down to take her hand, and said with grave earnestness 
and all his wonted deferential gentleness,

I am glad to find you here!

One could almost have heard the bolts and bars with which, at the 
sound of his footsteps, the girl shut herself in. But all colour was 
shut off as well. She rose to her feet, laying one hand on the chair 
back to steady herself, and answered simply, I am just going. 
And she turned to Gyda. But Rollo prevented her.

Wont you sit down again? said he. A minute or two? I have 
something to say to you, and now is the best time?

He turned to Gyda, but the old Norwegian was already leaving the 
room, and the two were alone. And perhaps to give her timeor 
himselfhe stood for a moment still and thoughtful by the side of 
the fireplace. And Hazel, who had thought she would take the first 
moment that offered to clear her name of the blot left upon it, sat 
in a sort of spell, and could not speak.

I want you, he began at length, with that same grave gentleness; 
he had himself well in hand now;I want you to give me, as a 
friend, some explanation of that which you told me the other day.

As a friendhe had not then forgotten the day of the month. 
That was one passing thought. And then, if Mr. Rollo had interest 
in new displays of character, he had a chance to prosecute the 
study, and see Wych Hazel as other people sometimes saw her; so 
far off she seemed in her reserve. This was not the sprite who had 
disputed his authority and pelted him with sharp speeches; nor the 
shy girl who had blushed if he but came near her; there was not 
even the faintest tinging of the cheeks, nor the least gleam from 
out the deep shadows of the eyes. Only in one way did the slightest 
agitation betray itself; but twice she began to speak, and twice 
could not command her lips; the third time she conquered them 
and went on. With down-looking eyes, and head a little bent, and 
hands quietly folded, as if they were too tired to hold each other in 
the old way, and that pathetic quiver still every now and then 
sweeping round her mouth and chin, Wych Hazel went straight to 
the midst of things, as if not daring to waste strength on 
preliminaries.

Sir Henry Crofton had laid a wageror vowed a vowthat he 
would not go back to England until he had waltzed with me. I saw 
him once or twice in the fall, and in town he came often to the 
house, and after that I met him everywhere. And he very often 
asked me to waltz. And I always refused.

One nightshe drew her breath, as if the words stifled herthen 
went on swiftly, as before, preventing all questions: One night, at 
Newport, we were both at an out-door party. There was music, of 
course; everybody was dancing. Except me. Sir Henry made his 
usual request, and then asked me to walk instead.

 "Do you really never waltz?" he said, as we passed up and down. 
I told him no.

 "But why not?" I said, one of my guardians disapproved of it.

 "Is he here to-night?"No.

 "Then, he will never know what you do." I said then, that I had 
promised.

 "Then it was not for my own pleasure I had given it up?" I said, 
no.

 "Didnt I sometimes wish for the pleasure again?" Sometimes, I 
confessed, when I heard the music.

 "Had I promised for always?" No.

 "O well!it was very easy to forget the precise date." I said 
(here for an instant a flush came) that I had not forgotten it.

We were standing just then by the open lawn and the circle of 
dancers; andI thinkmy foot stirred a little, answering the 
measure if a new waltz which the band struck up. In an instant, 
before I had time to think or speak, he had whirled me off among 
the crowd. So much taller than I, so much stronger, so skilled a 
dancer, that at first I could only go where I was taken, obliged to 
keep the step, in my own self-defence. One hand of course he held; 
but the otherdid nottouch him. And, presently, I made him let 
me go. But (we had gone so fast) not till we had taken rather more 
than one round, I think, I am not quit sure. And I always mean to 
tell you.The voice fell a little, breaking off short.

She had not looked at him once since he came in; she did not look 
now, to see how her story was received, but sat still, feeling as if 
her very life were at stand. His face had changed notably as she 
went on; its burden of grave care cleared away; his brow grew full 
of light; the eyebrows came into their wonted line; but Rollos 
eyes were the eyes of a man whose soul is on fire. He stood 
breathlessly at first, then sitting down beside the girl got 
possession of one of her hands, but only so speaking his sympathy 
or eagerness; till as she finished he brought it to his lips, or rather 
bowed his lips to it and kissed the little hand over and over. He 
made no other answer; he said no word at all, till the dark flush 
which had kindled in his face at her story a little faded away. Then, 
still holding her hand perhaps unconsciously close, he said, low 
enough,

And what about the guardianship, Hazel?

The girl was in that state when to withstand or to bear seems 
equally difficult: there is no strength for either; and the colour 
which flitted over her face at his demonstrations was less of 
shyness than of intense feeling. It all went now, at his words.

I thought, she said (the words came too quick, but she could not 
help it) that you had resigned, Mr. Rollo.

Rollo got the other hand into his keeping, and merely inquired in 
the same tone what she wanted him to do?

I used to want you to trust me. But it would not be any use now.

Rollos lips touched her hand again, both hands. What about the 
guardianship, Hazel? he repeated, with a glow and sparkle of the 
gray eyes, which yet had an odd veil of softness over them. But a 
man will be a man. I am afraid Rollo was smiling at the same time.

If anything could be called clear in Hazels mind, at that minute of 
supreme and universal confusion, it was, that belonging to 
somebody was getting to be much more than an idea. And that Mr. 
Rollo should merely pay her the compliment of requesting to have 
the fact put in words, might be highly characteristic on his part, but 
was not exactly composing on hers. How could she think, or 
speak, without even one hand free? And droop her head as she 
might, what could the soft falling hair do, but touch up the 
beautiful flushes which Hazel felt, if she did not see? Her words, 
when they came, went to a very self-evident point.

Butif you wanted itwhy did you give it up?

Give upwhat? came with undoubted astonishment from 
Rollos lips.

You stayed away said the girl, under her breath.

I have come back. And I want my sentence.

In a sort of desperation, Hazel gathered up her courage, as if 
realizing that she was face to face with the one question of her life, 
where she must risk anything but mistakes.

But, she said,but, Mr. Rollo,you did not mean to want it. 
When you stayed away.

He laughed. Look here! said he, I want it now, Hazel. Ill stand 
all your questions, after you have answered mine.

I think mine come first, she said softly,and something of the 
sorrow which had hung about the questions crept into her voice. 
Because, there might beat least, there might have beenthings 
which I could not explain. And thenas you could doubt me once, 
you would again. And I could not bear that twice! said Hazel, 
with a sudden quickness which told more than it meant. Nerve 
herself as she would, her hands were trembling now.

Rollo was not a man of more than average patience, sometimes. 
Nevertheless, though sorely tempted, he controlled the desire to 
give her kisses instead of rebukes, and answered quietly and 
gravely:

I took your own word once against yourself. I will never do it 
again, Hazel! So take care what you say to me. Have you nothing 
to say to me now?

If she had, it was not forthcoming.

About the guardianship, Hazel?

She hesitated a littlenot much; thinking of the face she dared not 
look at, and which she had scarcely seen for a year; answering then 
with a grave quietness which again was very like herself, where 
deep feeling was at work; the girlish voice falling and trembling 
just a little:

If you want ityou can have it, Mr. Rollo.

He took her in his arms then, very tenderly and gravely, kissing 
her on lips and cheeks with kisses which seemed to tell of a wish 
to indemnify himselfand her too,for the last three weeks; but 
then, having got what he wanted, for several minutes thereafter 
spoke not; partly for his own sake perhaps, partly for hers. A 
stillness more mighty than words, and quite beyond their sphere. 
When he did speak again, it was in a different key.

How comes your hair to be wet?

Mine? O! said Hazel, starting,It is nothing but a little 
water.

No, said Rollo laughing, nothing else. The question is, how 
came a little water on your hair?

What a question! It was put there. And if you want to know why, 
I will tell you. On purpose.

Who did it?

But that answer was slow to come. Gyda, she said at last.

'Gyda!' echoed Rollo, starting up a little, and removing Wych 
Hazel to a little distance from him, that he might look in her face 
better. 'For what purpose has Gyda been putting cold water on 
your hair?'

'O! I was tired when I got here,' Hazel said, trying to look up 
and laugh, and somehow failing. 'AndandAnd it does not 
signify the least in the world now.'

Rollo looked at her a minute silently, and then demanded 
imperiously to know 'what didn't signify?'

'Being faint is nothing,' she said. 'At least, after you have got over 
it.'

'What made you faint?' in the same tone.

Now Hazel had no mind to go into that; partly for the intrinsic 
merits of the case, but also with a growing consciousness that with 
those waves of trouble which had ebbed away so fast her strength 
was going too. That false strength of tension and self-control, by 
means of which she had lived and held her head up, through all 
these last weeks. Even excitement was giving way to reaction; and 
Hazel dreaded lest, before she knew it, she should break down; 
lest, before she could hinder it, that wilful fountain of unshed tears 
might insist on having its way. She knew from old experience 
what that meant; but (except for the slight specimen before Prim's 
eyes) nobody had ever seen her in one of her tear-storms, and she 
did not mean that any one should. And at the same time, belonging 
to somebody puts hindrances in the way of unseen escape; and the 
next thing would be, that some tender word or touch would find its 
way to the very depths which had been so lonely and sweep away 
all her defences. Then there was the walk! She answered, studying 
her case,

'I think, two or three things. But let me go now, please, Mr. Rollo. 
I must go home,it is late.'

'Let you go?' said he, in a curious, considerative way, as if 
studying several things.

'Yes,' she said, trying to get ready to get up from her chair. He sat 
looking at her, then touched again the wet hair. What was he 
thinking about?

'It seems to me,' he said slowly, 'you must have some of Gyda's 
porridge before you go.'

'Oh, no!' she said with some eagerness. 'I could not! Just let me 
go' and she rose up, steadying herself with one hand upon the 
chair-back. Rollo rose too, but it was to take her in his arms.

'The carriage is not here,' he said, looking at her and noting how 
well she needed the support he gave.

'Not just hereReo is waiting,' Hazel answered, flushing and 
drooping her head, and feeling as if every minute took her more 
and more out of her own reach.

'Where is he waiting?'

'Never mindWhere I left him. O Mr. Rollo! let me go!'

'But you see I must know, if I am to fetch him. Where is he, 
Wych?'

'At the foot of the hill.'No use! She could not debate matters, but 
her head bent lower.

'Reo was not at the foot of the hill when I came.'

'I meanthe other hill.'

'What other hill?'

'Oh!'she said deprecatingly; then went straight through. 'I came 
the other way.'

'I don't know but one way,' he answered half laughing.

'WellI do.'

'You will have to teach me. But something else must be done first. 
Come here and sit down again. You can hardly stand. You must 
rest and have a cup of coffee before I let you go anywhere. What 
sort of guardianship do you think you have come into?' he said 
very gently.

He put Wych Hazel in her chair, and then stooped down upon the 
hearth to lay brands together and coax up the decayed fire. Having 
made it burn, he turned and took an observation of her face. She 
had given one eager look after him as he turned away, but now 
was not looking, apparently, at anything, unless at some hidden 
point which she was trying to master; for her breath came a little 
quick, and her hands held each other tight; she was not even 
leaning back in her chair. And as to resting her head on her hands, 
Hazel would as soon have dared do anything. Well she knew, that 
with even that slight veil between her and the outer world, the last 
remnant of self-command would go. No, she must face it out, 
somehow, and drink the coffee, and wait. If only Gyda would not 
come in! And what would she say when she did?'and I could not 
stop her now,' thought Hazel to herself, 'If I say three words about 
anything!'She passed her hands over her eyes with a quick 
gesture, then put them down and held them tight. Could she run 
away? No, she was not strong enough, if she had the chance. And 
to be overtaken and brought back!she had tried that once. And 
all the while, as she sat thinking, these surges of repressed sorrow 
and joy and everything else that had filled her heart for the last 
month and the last hour, seemed to be just rolling nearer and 
nearer, gathering up their force as she lost hers; and how she was 
to stop them Hazel did not know. Onlyshe must not break down 
there. Not before him. But the colour left her face again in the 
struggle.

Rollo needed very small observation to move him to action. The 
first point was to bring up to the hearth a large wooden chair, half 
settee, with arms of very ample proportions; looking as if anybody 
less than a burly old ship-captain or fat landlady would be quite 
lost and cast away in it. This chair Rollo proceeded to line and
