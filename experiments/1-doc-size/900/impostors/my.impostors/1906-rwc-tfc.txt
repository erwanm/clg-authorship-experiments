" Then one day with me is not worth those many 
days of murder? " she asked in pretended astonishment. 





 



" Ask yourself why those many days would be doubly 
empty," he said so seriously that the pointless game 
began to confuse her. 

" Then " — she turned Hghtly from uncertain ground 
— " then perhaps we had better be about that matter of 
the cup you prize so highly. Are you ready, Mr. Si- 
ward.'' There is much to be killed yet — including time, 
you know." 

But the hinted sweetness of the challenge had 
aroused him, and he made no motion to rise. Nor did 
she. 

" I am not sure," he reflected, " just exactly what 
I should ask of you if you insist on taking away — " 
he turned and looked about him through the burnt 
gold foHage, " — if you took away all this out of my 
Hfe." 

" I shall not take it ; because I have nothing in ex- 
change to offer . . . you say," she answered impru- 
dently. 

" I did not say so," he retorted. 

" You did — reminding me that the court is already 
engaged for a continuous performance." 

" Was it necessary to remind you.'' " he asked with 
deliberate malice. 

She flushed up, vexed, silent, then looked directly 
at him with beautiful hostile eyes. " What do you mean, 
Mr. Siward.'' Are you taking our harmless, idle badi- 
nage as warrant for an intimacy unwarranted? " 

" Have I offended.'' " he asked, so impassively that 
a flash of resentment brought her to her feet, angry 
and self-possessed. 

" How far have we to go.'' " she asked quietly. 

He rose to his feet, turned, hailing the keeper, re- 
peating the question. And at the answer they both 









started forward, the dog ranging ahead through a dense 
growth of beech and chestnut, over a high brown ridge, 
then down, always down along a leafy ravine to the 
water's edge — a forest pond set in the gorgeous foliage 
of ripening maples. 

" I don't see," said Sylvia impatiently, " how we 
are going to obey instructions and go straight ahead. 
There must be a stupid boat somewhere ! " 

But the game-laden keeper shook his head, pulled 
up his hip boots, and pointed out a line of alder poles 
set in the water to mark a crossing. 

" Am I expected to wade.? " asked the girl anxiously. 

" This here," observed the keeper, " is one of the 
most sportin' courses on the estate. Last season I seen 
Miss Page go through it like a scared deer — the young 
lady, sir, that took last season's cup " — in explanation 
to Siward, who stood doubtfully at the water's edge, 
looking back at Sylvia. 

Raising her dismayed eyes she encountered his ; there 
was a little laugh between them. She stepped daintily 
across the stones to the water's edge, instinctively gath- 
ering her kilts in one hand. 

" Miles and I could chair you over," suggested 
Siward. 

" Is that fair — under the rules.? " 

" Oh, yes, Miss ; as long as you go straight," said 
the keeper. 

So they laid aside the guns and the guide's game- 
sack, and formed a chair with their hands, and, bearing 
the girl between them, they waded out along the driven 
alder stakes, knee-deep in brown water. 

Before them herons rose into heavy flapping flight, 
broad wings glittering in the sun; a diver, distantly 
afloat among the lily pads, settled under the water to 





 

his eyes as a submarine settles till the conning-tower is 
awash. 

Her arm, lightly resting around his neck, tightened 
a trifle as the water rose to his thighs ; then the faint 
pressure relaxed as they thrashed shoreward through 
the shallows, ankle deep once more, and landed among 
the dry reeds on the farther bank. 

Miles, the keeper, went back for the guns. Siward 
stamped about in the sun, shaking the drops from water- 
proof breeches and gaiters, only to be half drenched 
again when Sagamore shook himself vigorously. 

" I suppose," said Sylvia, looking sideways at Si- 
ward, " your contempt for my sporting accomplishments 
has not decreased. I'm sorry ; I donH like to walk in wet 
shoes . . . even to gain your approval." 

And, as the keeper came splashing across the shal- 
lows : " Miles, you may carry my gun. I shall not need 
it any longer " 

The upward roar of a bevey of grouse drowned her 
voice ; poor Sagamore, pointing madly in the blackberry 
thicket all unperceived, cast a dismayed glance aloft 
where the sunlit air quivered under the winnowing rush of 
heavy wings. Siward flung up his gun, heading a big 
quartering bird ; steadily the glittering barrels swept in 
the are of fire, hesitated, wavered ; then the possibility 
passed; the young fellow lowered the gun, slowly, 
gravely ; stood a moment motionless with bent head until 
the rising colour in his face had faded. 

And that was all, for a while. The astonished and 
disgusted keeper stared into the thicket; the dog lay 
quivering, impatient for signal. Sylvia's heart, which 
had seemed to stop with her voice, silenced in the gusty 
thunder of heavy wings, began beating too fast. For 
the ringing crack of a gun shot could have spoken no 









louder to her than the gUttering silence of the suspended 
barrels; nor any promise of his voice sound as the 
startled stillness sounded now about her. For he had 
made something a trifle more than mere amends for 
his rudeness. He was overdoing everything — a little. 

He stood on the thicket's edge, absently unloading 
the weapon, scarcely understanding what he had done 
and what he had not done. 

A moment later a far hail sounded across the up- 
lands, and against the sky figures moved distantly. 

" Alderdene and Marion Page," said Siward. " I 
believe we lunch yonder, do we not, Miles ? " 

They climbed the hill in silence, arriving after a few 
minutes to find others already at luncheon — the Page 
boys, eager, enthusiastic, recounting adventure by flood 
and field; Rena Bonnesdel tired and frankly bored and 
decorated with more than her share of mud ; Eileen Shan- 
non, very pretty, very effective, having done more exe- 
cution with her eyes than with the dainty fowling-piece 
beside her. 

Marion Page nodded to Sylvia and Siward with a 
crisp, business-like question or two, then went over to in- 
spect their bag, nodding approbation as Miles laid the 
game on the grass. 

" Eight full brace," she commented. " We have 
five, and an odd cock-pheasant — from Black Fells, I 
suppose. The people to our left have been blazing away 
like Coney Island, but Rena's guide says the ferns are 
full of rabbits that way, and Major Belwether can't hit 
fur afoot. You," she added frankly to Siward, " ought 
to take the cup. The birches ahead of you are full of 
woodcock. If you don't, Howard Quarrier will. He's 
into a flight of jack-snipe I hear." 

Siward's eyes had suddenly narrowed; then he 




 

laughed, patting Sagamore's cheeks. " I don't believe 
I shall shoot very steadily this afternoon," he said, 
turning toward the group at luncheon under the trees. 
" I wish Quarrier well — with the cup." 

" Nonsense," said Marion Page curtly ; " you are 
the cleanest shot I ever knew." And she raised her glass 
to him, frankly, and emptied it with the precision char- 
acteristic of her : " Your cup ! With all my heart ! " 

" I also drink to your success, Mr. Siward," said 
Sylvia in a low voice, lifting her champagne glass in the 
sunlight. " To the Shotover Cup — if you wish it." 
And as other glasses sparkled aloft amid a gay tumult 
of voices wishing him success, Sylvia dropped her voice, 
attuning it to his ear alone : " Success for the cup, if 
you wish it — or, whatever you wish — success ! " and she 
meant it very kindly. 

His hand resting on his glass he sat, smiling silent 
acknowledgment to the noisy generous toasts ; he turned 
and looked at Sylvia when her low voice caught his ear — 
looked at her very steadily, unsmiling. 

Then to the others, brightening again, he said a 
word or two, wittily, with a gay compliment well placed 
and a phrase to end it in good taste. And, in the little 
gust of hand-clapping and laughter, he turned again to 
Sylvia, smilingly, sajang under his breath : " As though 
winning the cup could compensate me now for los- 
ing it ! " 

She leaned involuntarily nearer : " You mean that 
you will not try for it? " 

" Yes." 

" That is not fair— to me ! '' 

"Why not.?" 

" Because — because I do not ask it of you." 

" You need not, now that I know your wish." 








" Mr. Siward, I — my wish " 

But she had no chance to finish ; already Rena Bon- 
nesdel was looking at them, and there was a hint of 
amused surprise in Eileen Shannon's mischievous eyes, 
averted instantly, with malicious ostentation. 

Then Marion Page took possession of him so exclu- 
sively, so calmly, that something in her cool certainty 
vaguely irritated Sylvia, who had never liked her. Be- 
sides, the girl showed too plainly her indifference to other 
people ; which other people seldom find amusing. 

" Stephen," called out Alderdene, anxiously counting 
the web loops in his khaki vest, " what do you call 
fair shooting at these damnable ruffed grouse.'' You 
needn't be civil about it, you know." 

" Five shells to a bird is good shooting," answered 
Siward. " Don't you think so. Miss Page.? " 

" You have a better score, Mr, Siward," said Marion 
Page with a hostile glance at Alderdene, who had not 
made good. 

" That was chance — and this year's birds. I've 
taken ten shells to an old drummer in hard wood or short 
pines." He smiled to himself, adding : " A drove of six 
in the open got off scot free a little while ago. Miss 
Landis saw it." 

That he was inclined to turn it all to banter relieved 
her at once. " It was pitiable," she nodded gravely 
to Marion ; " his nerve left him when they made such a 
din in the briers." 

Miss Page glanced at her indifferently. 

" What I need is practice like the chasseurs of 
Tarascon," admitted Siward. 

" I willingly offer my hat, monsieur," said Sylvia. 

Marion Page, impatient to start, had turned her 
tailor-made back to the company, and was instructing 





 

his crestfallen lordship very plainly : " You fire too 
quickly, Blinky ; two seconds is w hat you must count 
when a grouse flushes. You must say ' Mark ! Right ! ' 
or 'Mark! Left! Bang!'" 

" I might as well say ' Bang ! ' for all I've done 
to-da}'," he muttered, adjusting his shooting-goggles 
and snapping his eyes like fury. Then exploding into 
raucous laughter he moved off southward with Marion 
Page, who had exchanged a swift handshake with Si- 
ward; the twins follow ed, convoying Eileen and Rena, 
neither maiden excitedly enthusiastic. And so the lunch- 
con party lord and lady, twins and maidens, guides 
and dogs, trailed away across the ridge, distant sil- 
K'Ouettes presenth- against the sky, then gone. And 
after a little while the far, dry, accentless report of 
smokeless powder announced that the opening of the sea- 
'on had been resumed and the Lesser Children were dying 
fast in the glory of a perfect da}'. 

" Are you ready, Mr. Siward ? " She stood waiting 
for him at the edge of the thicket ; IMiles resumed his 
game sack and her fowling-piece; the dog came up, 
looking him anxiously in the ejes. 

So he walked forward beside her into the dappled 
light of the thicket. 

Within a few minutes the dog stood twice ; and twice 
the whirring twitter of woodcock startled her, echoed by 
the futile crack of his gun. 

" Beg pardon, sir " 

" Yes, Miles," with a glint of humour. 

" Overshot, sir, — excusin' the liberty, Mr. Siward. 
Both marked down forty yard to the left if you wish 
to start 'em again." 

" No," he said indifferently, " I had my chance at 
them. They're exempt." 









Then Sagamore, tail wildly whipping, came smack 
on the trail of an old stager of a cock-grouse — on, on 
over rock, log, wet gully, and dry ridge, twisting, 
doubling, circling, every wile, every trick employed and 
met, until the dog crawling noiselessly forward, trembled 
and froze, and Siward, far to left, wheeled at the muf- 
fled and almost noiseless rise. For an instant the slant- 
ing barrels wavered, grew motionless; but only a stray 
sunbeam glinting struck a flash of cold fire from the 
muzzle, only the feathery whirring whisper broke the 
silence of suspense. Then far away over sunny tree 
tops a big grouse sailed up, rocketing into the sky on 
slanted wings, breasting the height of green; dipped, 
glided downward with bowed wings stifl'ened, and was en- 
gulfed in the misty barriers of purpling woods. 

" Vale! " said Siward aloud, " I salute you ! " 

He came strolling back across the crisp leaves, the 
dappled sunshine playing over his face like the flicker of 
a smile. 

" Miles," he said, " my nerve is gone. Such things 
happen. I'm all in. Come over here, my friend, and 
look at the sun with me." 

The discomfited keeper obeyed. 

" Where ought that refulgent luminary to scintilate 
when I face Osprey Ledge? " 

"Sir.?" 

" The sun. How do I hold it.? " 

" On the p'int of your right shoulder, sir. . . . You 
ain't quittin', Mr. Siward, sir ! " anxiously ; " that Shot- 
over Cup is easy yours, sir ! " eagerly ; " Wot's a miss 
on a old drummer, Mr. Siward? Wot's twice over- 
shootin' cock, sir, when a blind dropper can see you are 
the cleanest, fastest, hard-shootin' shot in the hull 
county ! " 





 

But Siward shook his head with an absent glance 
at the dog, and motioned the astonished keeper forward. 

" Line the easiest trail for us," he said ; " I think 
we are already a trifle tired. Twigs will do in short 
cover; use a hatchet in the big timber. . . . And go 
slow till we join you." 

And when the unwilling and perplexed keeper had 
started, Siward, unlocking his gun, drew out the smooth 
yellow cartridges and pocketed them. 

Sylvia looked up as the sharp metallic click of the 
locked breech rang out in the silence. 

" Why do you do this, Mr. Siward? " 

" I don't know ; really I am honest ; I don't know." 

'' It could not be because I " 

" No, of course not," he said, too seriously to reassure her. 

" Mr. Siward," in quick displeasure. 

"Yes.?" 

" What you do for your amusements cannot concern me." 

" Right as usual," he said so gaily that a reluctant 
smile trembled on her lips. 

" Then why have you done this? It is unreasonable 
— if you don't feel as I do about killing things that are 
having a good time in the world." 

He stood silent, absently looking at the fowling- 
piece cradled in his left arm. " Shall we sit here a mo- 
ment and talk it over? " he suggested listlessly. 

Her blue gaze swept him ; his vague smile was indif- 
ferently bland. 

" If you are determined not to shoot, we might as 
well start for Osprey Ledge," she suggested ; " other- 
wise, what reason is there for our being here together, 
Mr. Siward?" 








Awaiting his comment — perhaps expecting a counter- 
proposition — she leaned against the tree beside which he 
stood. And after a while, as his absent-minded preoc- 
cupation continued : 

" Do you think the leaves are dry enough to sit on? " 

He slipped off his shooting-coat and placed it at the 
base of the tree. She waited for a second, uncertain how 
to meet an attitude which seemed to take for granted 
matters which might, if discussed, give her at least the 
privilege of yielding. However, to discuss a triviality 
meant forcing emphasis where none was necessary. She 
seated herself ; and, as he continued to remain standing, 
she stripped off her shooting-gloves and glanced up at 
him inquiringly : " Well, Mr. Siward, I am literally at 
your feet." 

" Which redresses the balance a little," he said, find- 
ing a place near her. 

" That is very nice of you. Can I always count on 
you for civil platitudes when I stir you out of your day- 
dreams.'' " 

'' You can always count on stirring me without ef- 
fort." 

" No, I can't. Nobody can. You are never to be 
counted on; you are too absent-minded. Like a veil 
you wrap yourself in a brown study, leaving everybody 
outside to consider the pointed flattery of your with- 
drawal. What happens to you when you are inside 
that magic veil.'' Do you change into anything inter- 
esting ? " 

He sat there, chin propped on his linked fingers, 
elbows on knees ; and, though there was always the hint 
of a smile in his pleasant eyes, always the indefinable 
charm of breeding in voice and attitude, something now 
was lacking. And after a moment she concluded that 




 

it was his attention. Certainly his wits were wool-gath- 
ering again ; his eyes, edged with the shadow of a smile, 
saw far beyond her, far beyond the sunlit shadows where 
they sat. 

In his preoccupation she had found him nega- 
tively attractive. She glanced at him now from time to 
time, her eyes returning always to the beauty of the 
subdued light where all about them silver-stemmed 
birches clustered like slim shining pillars, crowned with 
their autumn canopy of crumpled gold. 

" Enchantment ! " she said under her breath. 
" Surely an enchanted sleeper lies here somewhere." 

" You," he observed, " unawakened." 

" Asleep? I? " She looked around at him. " You 
are the dreamer here. Your eyes are full of dreaming 
even now. What is your desire ? " 

He leaned on one arm, watching her; she had 
dropped her ungloved hand, searching among the newly 
fallen gold of the birch leaves drifted into heaps. On 
the third finger a jewel glittered; he saw it, conscious 
of its meaning — but his eyes followed the hand idly 
heaping up autumn gold, a whiie slim hand, smoothly 
fascinating. Then the little, restless hand swept near 
to his, almost touching it ; and then instinctively he took 
it in his own, curiously, lifting it a little to consider its 
nearer loveliness. Perhaps it was the unexpectedness of 
it, perhaps it was sheer amazement that left her hand 
lying idly relaxed like a white petalled blossom in his. 
His bearing, too, was so blankly impersonal that for a 
moment the whole thing appeared inconsequent. Then, 
as her hand lay there, scarcely imprisoned, their eyes 
encountered, — and hers, intensely blue now, considered 
him without emotion, studied him impersonally without 
purpose, incuriously acquiescent, indifferently expectant. 









After a little while the consciousness of the contact 
disconcerted her ; she withdrew her fingers with an invol- 
untary shiver. 

" Is there no chance? " he asked. 

Perplexed with her own emotion, the meaning of his 
low-voiced question at first escaped her ; then, like its own 
echo, came ringing back in her ears, re-echoed again as he 
repeated it: 

" Is there no chance for me, Miss Landis.'' " 

The very revulsion of self-possession returning 
chilled her ; then anger came, quick and hot ; then pride. 
She deliberated, choosing her words coolly enough: 
" What chance do you mean, Mr. Siward.'' " 

" A fighting chance. Can you give it to me ? " 

" A fighting chance.? For what.? " — very low, very 
dangerous. 

" For you." 

Then, in spite of her, her senses became unsteady; 
a sudden ringing confusion seemed to deafen her, through 
which his voice, as if very far away, sounded again". 

" Men who are worth a fighting chance ask for it 
sometimes — but take it always. I take it." 

Her pallor faded under the flood of bright colour; 
the blue of her eyes darkened ominously to velvet. 

" Mr. Siward," she said, very distinctly and slowly, 
" I am not — even — sorry — for you." 

'' Then my chance is desperate indeed," he retorted 
coolly. 

" Chance ! Do you imagine — " Her anger choked 
her. 

"Are you not a little hard.?" he said, paling 
under his tan. " I supposed women dismissed men more 
gentfy — even such a man as I am." 

For a full minute she strove to comprehend, 




 

" Such a man as you ! " she repeated vaguely ; " you 
mean — " a crimson wave dyed her skin to the temples and 
she leaned toward him in horror-stricken contrition ; 
" I didn't mean that, Mr. Siward ! I — I never thought 
of that ! It had no weight, it was not in my thoughts. 
I meant only that you had assumed what is unwarranted 
— that you — your question humiliated me, knowing that 
I am engaged — knowing me so little — so " 

" Yes, I knew everything. Ask yourself why I risk 
everything to say this to you.? There can be only one 
answer." 

Then after a long silence : " Have I ever — " she be- 
gan tremblingly — " ever by word or look " 

" No." 

" Have I even " 

" No. I've simply discovered how I feel. That's 
what I was dreaming about when you asked me. I 
was afraid I might do this too soon ; but I meant to do 
it anyway before it became too late." 

" It was too late from the very moment we met, Mr. 
Siward." And, as he reddened painfully again, she 
added quickly : " I mean that I had already decided. 
Why will you take what I say so dreadfully different 
rom the way I intend it .f' Listen to me. I — I believe I 
am not very experienced yet ; I was a — astonished — 
quite stunned for a moment. Then it hurt me — and I 
said that I was not sorry for you ... I am sorry, 
now." 

And, as he said nothing : " You were a little rough, 
a little sudden with me, Mr. Siward. Men have asked 
me that question — several times ; but never so soon, so 
unreasonably soon — never without some preliminary 
of some sort, so that I could foresee, be more or less 
prepared. . . . But you gave me no warning. I — if 









you had, I would have known how to be gentle. I — I 
wish to be now. I like you — enough to say this to you, 
enough to be seriously sorry; if I could bring myself 
to really believe this — feeling " 

Still he said nothing; he sat there listlessly study- 
ing the sun spots glowing, waxing, waning on the carpet 
of dead leaves at his feet. 

" As for — what you have said," she added, a little 
smile curving the sensitive mouth, " it is impulsive, un- 
considered, a trifle boyish, Mr. Siward. I pay rnyself 
the compliment of your sincerity ; it is rather nice to be 
a girl who can awaken the romance in a man within a 
day or twe's acquaintance. . . . And that is all it is — 
a romantic impulse with a pretty girl. You see I am 
frank ; I am really glad that you find me attractive. 
Tell me so, if you wish. We shall not misunderstand 
each other again. Shall we? " 

He raised his head, considering her, forcing the smile 
to meet her own. 

" We shall be better friends than ever," she asserted 
confidently. 

" Yes, better than ever." 

" Because what you have done means the nicest 
sort of friendship, you see. You can't escape its duties 
and responsibilities now, Mr. Siward. I shall expect 
you to spend the greater part of your life in devotedly 
doing things for me. Besides, I am now privileged to 
worry you with advice. Oh, you have invested me with 
all sorts of powers now ! " 

He nodded. 

She sprang to her feet, flushed, smiling, a trifle 
excited. 

" Is it all over, and are we the very ideals of 
friends.'' " she asked. 





 

" The very ideals." 

" You are nice ! " she said impulsively, holding out 
both gloveless hands. He held them, she looking at 
him very sweetly, very confidently. 

" Allans! Without malice.'' " she asked. 

" Without malice." 

" Without afterthoughts? " 

'' Without afterthoughts." 

"And — you are content .f'" persuasively. 

" Of course not," he said. 

" Oh, but you must be." 

" I must be," he repeated obediently. 

" And you are ! Say it ! " 

" But it does not make me unhappy not to be con- 
tented " 

" Say it, please ; or — do you desire me to be un- 
happy ? " 

Her small, smooth hands lying between his, they stood 
confronting one another in the golden light. She might 
easily have brought the matter to an end ; and why slie 
did not, she knew no more than a kitten waking to con- 
sciousness under its first caress. 

" Say it," she repeated, laughing uncertainly back 
into his smiling eyes of a boy. 

" Say what.? " 

" That you are contented." 

" I can't." 

" Mr. Siward, it is unkind, it is shameless " 

" I know it ; I am that sort." 

" Then I am sorry for you. Look at that ! " turn- 
ing her left hand in his so that the jewel on the third 
finger caught the light. 

" I see it." 

" And yet—" 









" And yet." 

" That," she observed with composure, " is sheer ob- 
stinacy. . . . Isn't it.'' " 

" It is what I said it'was: a hopeful discontent." 

"How can it be.''" impatiently now, for the long, 
unaccustomed contact was unnerving her — yet she made 
no motion to withdraw her hands. " How can you really 
care for me ? Do you actually believe that — devotion — 
comes like that ? " 

" Exactly like that." 

" So suddenly ? It is impossible ! " with a twist of 
her pretty shoulders. 

" How did it come — to you? " he asked between his 
teeth. 

Then her face grew scarlet and her eyes grew dark, 
and her hands contracted in his — tightened, twisted fin- 
gers entangled, until, with a little sob, she swayed tow- 
ard him and he caught her. An instant, a minute — 
more, perhaps, she did not know— ;-she half lay in his 
arms, her untaught lips cold against his. Lassitude, 
faint consciousness, then tiny shock on shock came the 
burning revulsion ; and her voice came back, too, sound- 
ing strangely to her, a colourless, monotonous voice. 

He had freed her; she remembered that somebody 
had asked him to — perhaps herself. That was well; 
she needed to breathe, to summon strength and common- 
sense, find out what had been done, what reasonless 
madness she had committed in the half-light of the silver- 
stemmed trees clustering in shameful witness on every 
hand. 

Suddenly the hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her, 
and she covered her face with her hands, standing, almost 
swaying, as wave on wave of incredulous shame seemed 
to sweep her from knee to brow. That phase passed 





 

after a while ; out of it she emerged, flushed, outwardly 
composed, into another phase, in full self-possession once 
more, able to understand what had happened without 
the disproportion of emotional exaggeration. After all, 
she had only been kissed. Besides she was a novice, 
which probably accounted, in a measure, for the unreasonable emotion coincident with a caress to which she was 
unaccustomed. Without looking up at him she found 
herself saying coolly enough to surprise herself: " I 
never supposed I was capable of that. It appears that I 
am. I haven't anything to say for myself . . . except 
that I feel fearfully humiliated. . . . Don't say anything now ... I do not blame you, truly I do not. 
It was contemptible of me — to do it — wearing this — " 
she stretched out her slender left hand, not looking at 
him ; " it was contemptible ! " . . . She slowly raised 
her eyes, summoning all her courage to face him. 

But he only saw in the pink confusion of her lovely 
face the dawning challenge of a coquette saluting her 
adversary in gay acknowledgment of his fleeting moment 
of success. And as his face fell, then hardened into 
brightness, instantly she divined how he rated her, and 
in a flash realized her weapons and her security, and 
that the control of the situation was hers, not in the 
control of this irresolute young man who stood so silently 
considering her. Strange that she should be ashamed 
of her own innocence, willing that he believe her accomplished in such arts, enchanted that he no longer perhaps suspected genuine emotion in the swift, confused 
sweetness of her first kiss. If only all that were truly 
hidden from him, if he dare not in his heart convict her 
of anything save perfection in a gay, imprudent role, 
what a weight lifted, what relief, what hot self-contempt 
cooled ! What vengeance, too, she would take on him 









for the agony of her awakening — the dazed chagrin, 
the dread of his wise, amused eyes — eyes that she 
feared had often looked upon such scenes ; eyes no doubt 
familiar with such unimportant details as the shamed demeanour of a novice. 

" Why do you take it so seriously ? " she said, laughing and studying him, certain now of herself in this 
new disguise. 

" Do you take it lightly.'' " he asked, striving to 
smile. 

" I.'' Ah, I must, you know. You don't expect to 
marry me ... do you, Mr. Siward.f' "
