Several of the company dropped 
upon their knees and did their best 
to see. One or two thought they 
discerned something hke a track; 
the others shook their heads and con- 
fessed that the smooth hard surface 
had no marks upon it which their 
eyes were sharp enough to discover. 
One said, " Maybe a child's foot could 
make a mark on it, but I don't see 
how." 

Young Stillman stepped outside, 
held the light to the ground, turned 
leftward, and moved along three steps. 



On the trail closely examining; then said,
"I've got the direction — come along; take 
the lantern, somebody." 
He strode off swiftly southward. 
The files following, swaying and bending 
in and out with the deep curves 
of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the 
mouth of the gorge was reached; 
before them stretched the sage-brush 
Following an plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman 
called a halt, saying, "We mustn't 
start wrong, now; we must take the 
direction again.'' He took a lantern 
and examined the ground for a matter 
of twenty yards; then said, "Come 
on; it's all right," and gave up the 
lantern. In and out among the sage- 
bushes he marched, a quarter of a 
mile, bearing gradually to the right; 
then took a new direction and made 
another great semicircle; then changed 
again and moved due west nearly 
half a mile — and stopped. 
"She gave it up, here, poor little 
chap. Hold the lantern. You can 
see where she sat' 

But this was in a slick alkali flat 
which was surfaced like steel, and no 
person in the party was quite hardy 
enough to claim an eyesight that 
could detect the track of a cushion 
on a veneer like that. The bereaved 
mother fell upon her knees and kissed 
the spot, lamenting. 

"But where is she, then?'' some 
one said. "She didn't stay here. 
We can see that much, anyway." 

Stillman moved about in a circle 
around the place, with the lantern, 
pretending to hunt for tracks. " Well ! ' ' 
he said presently, in an annoyed 
tone, "I don't understand it." He 
examined again. ''No use. She was 
here — that's certain; she never walked 
away from here — and that's certain. 
It's a puzzle; I can't make it out." 

The mother lost heart then. 

"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! 
some flying beast has got her. I'll 
never see her again!" 

"Ah, don't give up," said Archy. 
"We'll find her— don't give up." 

"God bless you for the words, 
Archy Stillman!" and she seized his 
hand and kissed it fervently. 

Peterson, the new-comer, whispered 
satirically in Ferguson's ear: 

"Wonderful performance to find 
this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth 
while to come so far, though; any 
other supposititious place would have 
answered just as well — hey?" 

Ferguson was not pleased with 
the innuendo. He said, with some 
warmth : ' 

"Do you mean to insinuate that 
the child hasn't been here? I tell 
you the child has been here! Now 
if you want to get yourself into as 
tidy a little fuss as — '' 

''All right!" sang out Stillman 
"Come, everybody, and look at this! 
It was right under our noses all the 
time, and we didn't see it' 

There was a general plunge for 
the ground at the place where the 
child was alleged to have rested, and 
many eyes tried hard and hopefully to 
see the thing that Archy's finger was 
resting upon. There was a pause, 
then a several-barrelled sigh of disappointment. 
Pat Riley and Ham 
Sandwich said, in the one breath: 

"What is it, Archy? There's nothing 
here.' 

"Nothing? Do you call that noth- 
ing?'' and he swiftly traced upon 
the ground a form with his finger. 
"There — don't you recognize it now? 
It's Injim Billy's track. He's got 
the child." 

"God be praised!" from the mother. 

"Take away the lantern. I've got 
the direction. Follow!" 

He started on a run, racing in and 
out among the sage-bushes a matter 
of three hundred yards, and disap- 
peared over a sand-wave; the others 
struggled after him, caught him up, 
and foimd him waiting. Ten steps 
 
away was a little wickieup, a dim 
and formless shelter of rags and old 
horse-blankets, a dull light showing 
through its chinks. 

''You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the 
lad. ''It's your privilege to be 
first." 

All followed the sprint she made 
for the wickieup, and saw, with her, 
the picture its interior afforded. Injun 
Billy was sitting on the ground; tost one 
the child was asleep beside him. The 
mother hugged it with a wild embrace, 
which included Archy Stillman, the 
grateful tears running down her face, 
and in a choked and broken voice 
she poured out a golden stream of 
that wealth of worshipping endear- 
ments which has its home in full
richness nowhere but in the Irish 
he. 

" I find her b3nneby it is ten oclock' 
Billy explained. " She 'sleep out yon- 
der, ve'y tired — face wet, been cry- 



Injan's' spose; fetch her home, feed her, 

she heap much hungry — go 'sleep.'

In her limitless gratitude the happy 
mother waived rank and hugged him 
too, calling him ''the angel of God 
in disguise." 

And he probably was in disguise 
if he was that kind of an official. He 
was dressed for the character. 

At half past one in the morning 
the procession burst into the village, 
singing " When Johnny Comes March- 
ing Home," waving its lanterns, and 
swallowing the drinks that were 
brought out all along its course. It  
concentrated at the tavern, and made  
a night of what was left of the morning. 
I 

HE next afternoon the 
village was electrified 
with an immense sen- 
sation. A grave and 
dignified foreigner of distinguished 
bearing and appearance had arrived 
at the tavern, and entered this for 
midable name upon the register: 

Sherlock Holmes. 

The news buzzed from cabin to 
cabin, from claim to claim; tools 
were dropped, and the town swarmed 
toward the centre of interest. A man 
passing out at the northern end of 
the village shouted it to Pat Riley, 
whose claim was the next one to 
Flint Buckner's. At that time Fet- 
lock Jones seemed to turn sick. He 
muttered to himself: 

" Uncle Sherlock I The mean luck 
of it I — that he should come just 
when , . ." He dropped into a rev- 
erie, and presently said to himself: 
"But what's the use of being afraid 
of him? Anybody that knows him 
the way I do knows he can't detect a 
crime, except when he plans it all out 
beforehand and arranges the clews 
and hires some fellow to commit 
it according to instructions. . . . 
Now there ain't going to he any clews 
this time — so, what show has he got? 
None at all. No, sir; everything's 
ready. If I was to risk putting it 
off. . . . No, I won't run any risk like 
that. Flint Buckner goes out of this 
world to-night, for sure." Then an- 
other trouble presented itself. "Un- 
cle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk 
home matters with me this evening, 
and how am I going to get rid of him? 
for I've got to be at my cabin a minute  

or two about eight o'clock." This 

was an awkward matter, and cost 

him much thought. But he found 

a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll 

go for a walk, and I'll leave him in 

the road a minute, so that he won't 

see what it is I do: the best way to 

throw a detective off the track, anyway, 
is to have him along when you 
are preparing the thing. Yes, that's 
the safest — I'll take him with me." 


Meantime the road in front of the 
tavern was blocked with villagers 
waiting and hoping for a glimpse of 
the g reat m an. But he kept his 
room, and did not appear. None 
but Ferguson, Jake Parker the black- 
smith, and Ham Sandwich had any 
luck. These enthusiastic admirers of 
the great scientific detective hired the 
tavern's detained - baggage lockup, 
which looked into the detective's room 
across a little alleyway ten or twelve 
feet wide, ambushed themselves in it, 
and cut some peep-holes in the win- 
dow-blind. Mr. Holmes's blinds were 
down; but by-and-by he raised them. 
It gave the spies a hair-Hfting but 
pleasurable thrill to find themselves 
face to face with the Extraordinary 
Man who had filled the world with 
the fame of his more than human 
ingenuities. There he sat — not a 
m3i:h, not a shadow, but real, alive, 
compact of substance, and almost 
within touching distance with the 
hand. 

''Look at that head!'' said Fergu- 
son, in an awed voice. ".By:£raciQus ! 
that's a head!'' 

"ybuTbetr said the blacksmith, 
with deep reverence. "Look at his 
nose! look at his eyes! Intellect? 
Just a battery of it!'' 

"And that paleness," said Ham 
Sandwich. ''Comes from thought — 
that's what it comes from. Hell! 
duffers like us .don't knoLwhat real 
thought is." 

"No more we don't' said Fergu- 
son. "What we take for thinking 
is just blubber-and-slush. " 

" Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And 
look at that frown — that's deep think- 
ing — away down, down, forty fathom 
into the bowels of things. He's on 
the track of something." 

"Well, he is, and don't you forget 
it. Say — look at that awful gravity 
— look at that pallid solemness — there 
ain't any corpse can lay over it." 

" No, sir, not for dollars ! And 
it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; 
he's been dead four times a'ready, 
and there's historyiior it. Three 
times natural, once by accident. Fve 
heard say he smells damp and colS, 
like a grave. And he — " 

""ShTlVatch him I There — he's 
got his thumb on the btmip on the 
near corner of his forehead, and his 
forefinger on the off one. His think- Grind- 

works is just 3.- grinding now, you bet - 

your other shirt." 

"That's so. And now he's gazing 
up toward heaven and stroking his 
mustache slow, and — '' 

"Now he has rose up standing, 
and is putting his clews together on 
his left fingers with his right finger. 
See? he touches the forefinger — now 
middle finger — now ring-finger — '* 

"Stuck!" 

"Look at him scowl! He can't 
seem to make out thxit clew. So he — '' 

"See him smile! — like a tiger — 
and tally off the other fingers like 
nothing! He's got it, boys; he's 
got it sure!" 

"Well, I should say! Td hate to 
be in that man's place that he's after." 

Mr. Holmes drew a table to the 
window, sat down with his back to 
the spies, and proceeded to write. 
The spies withdrew their eyes from 
the peep-holes, Ht their pipes, and 
settled themselves for a comfortable 
smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with 
conviction : 

"Boys, it's no use talking, he's 
a wonder! He's got the signs of it 
all over him." 

''You hain't ever said a truer 
word than that, Wells-Fargo' said 
Jake Parker. "Say, wouldn't it 'a' 
been nuts if he'd a -been here last 
night?" 

"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" 
said Ferguson. "Then we'd have Sden- 

seen scientific work. Intellect — just
pure intellect — away up on the upper '" 

levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all 
right, and it don't become anybody 
to belittle him, I can tell you. But 
his gift is only just eyesight, sharp 
as an owl's, as near as I can make it 
out just a grand natural animal tal- 
ent, no more, no less, and prime as 
far as it goes, but no intellect in it, 
and for awfulness and marvellousness 
no more to be compared to what 
this man does than — than — Why, 
let me tell you what he'd have done. 
He'd have stepped over to Hogan's 
and glanced — just glanced, that's all 
— at the premises, and that's enough. 
See everything? Yes, sir, to the 
last little cfetail; and he'd know more 
about that place than the Hogans 
would know in seven years. Next, 
method   
he would sit down on the bunk, just 
as ca'm, and say to Mrs. Hogan — 
Say, Ham, consider that you are 
Mrs. Hogan. I'll ask the questions; 
you answer them." 

"All right; goon." 

"Madam, if you please — attention 
— do not let your mind wander. Now, 
then — sex of the child?" 

"Female, your Honor." 

" Um — female. Very good, very 
good. Age?- . 

"Turned six, your Honor." " 

" Um — yoimg, weak — two miles. 
Weariness will overtake it then. It 
will sink down and sleep. We shall 
find it two miles away, or less. 
Teeth?" 

" Five, your Honor, and one a-coming." 

"Very good, very good, very good 
indeed. You see, boys, he knows a 
clew when he sees it, when it wouldn't 
mean a dem thing to anybody else. 
Stockings, madam? Shoes?'' 

"Yes, your Honor — both." 

"Yam, perhaps? Morocco?" 

"Yam, your Honor. And kip." 

"Um — kip. This complicates the 
matter. However, let it go — we shall 

manage. Religion?'' 
And 
then I '' Catholic, your Honor. '' 

"Very good. Snip me a bit from 
the bed blanket, please. Ah, thanks. 
Part wool — foreign make. Very well. 
A snip from some garment of the 
child's, please. Thanks. Cotton. 
Shows wear. An excellent clew, 
excellent. Pass me a pellet of the 
floor dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, 
many thanks. Ah, admirable, ad- 
mirable! Now we know where we 
are, I think. You see, boys, he's 
got all the clews he wants now; he 
don't need anything more. Now, 
then, what does this Extraordinary 
Man do? He lays those snips and 
that dirt out on the table and leans 
over them on his elbows, and puts 
them together side by side and 
studies them — mumbles to himself, 
'Female'; changes them around — 
mumbles, 'Six years old'; changes 
them this way and that — again mum- 
bles : ' Five teeth — one a-coming — 
Catholic — yarn — cotton — kip — thinking 
damn that kip Then he straight- 
ens up and gazes toward heaven, 
and ploughs his hands through his 
hair — ploughs and ploughs, mutter- 
ing, ' Damn that kip ! ' Then he stands 
up and frowns, and begins to tally 
off his clews on his fingers — and gets 
stuck at the ring-finger. But only 
just a minute — then his face glares 
all up in a smile like a house afire, 
and he straightens up stately and 
majestic, and says to the crowd, ' Take 
a lantern, a couple of you, and go 
down to Injun Billy's and fetch the 
child — the rest of you go 'long home 
to bed; good-night, madam; good- 
night, gents And he bows like the 
Matterhorn, and pulls out for the 
Edsy style tavern. That's his style, 
and the only — scientific, intellectual — 
all over in fifteen minutes — no poking around 

all over the sage-brush range an hour 

and a half in a mass-meeting crowd 

for him, boys — you hear me !" 

''By Jackson, it's grand!" said 

Ham Sandwich. '' Wells-Fargo, you've 

got him down to a dot. He ain't 

painted up any exacter to the life in 

the books. By George, I can just see 

him -can't you, boys?" 

''You bet you! It's just a photo-made  graft, 
that's what it is." 
Ferguson was profoundly pleased 
with his success, and grateful. He 
sat silently enjoying his happiness a 
little while, then he murmured, with 
a deep awe in his voice. 

" I wonder if God made him?" 

There was no response for a moment; 
then Ham Sandwich said, reverently, 

''Not all at one time, I reckon." 

IT eight o'clock that even- 
ing two persons were 
groping their way past 
Flint Buckner's cabin in 
the frosty gloom. They were Sher- 
lock Holmes and his nephew. 

"Stop here in the road a moment, 
iincle' said Fetlock, "while I run 
to my cabin; I won't be gone a 
minute.'' 

He asked for something — the uncle 
furnished it — then he disappeared in 
the darkness, but soon returned, and 
the talking-walk was resumed. By 

nine o'clock they had wandered back  

to the tavern. They worked their 

way through the billiard-room, where 

a crowd had gathered in the hope of 

getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary 

Man. A royal cheer was raised. Mr. 

Holmes acknowledged the compliment 

with a series of courtly bows, and as 

he was passing out his nephew said 

to the assemblage, 

"Uncle Sherlock's got some work 
to do, gentlemen, that'll keep him 
till twelve or one, but he'll be down 
again then, or earlier if he can, and 
hopes some of you'll be left to take a 
drink with him." 

"By George, he's just a duke, 
boys! Three cheers for Sherlock 
Holmes, the greatest man that ever 
lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip, 

"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!" 
To treat The Uproar shook the building, 
so hearty was the feeling the boys 
put into their welcome. Upstairs the 
uncle reproached the nephew gently, 
saying, 

"What did you get me into that 
engagement for?" 

" I reckon you don't want to be un- 
popular, do you, uncle? Well, then, 
don't you put on any exclusiveness 
in a mining-camp, that's all. The 
boys admire you; but if you was to 
leave without taking a drink with 
them, they'd set you down for a snob. 
And, besides, you said you had home 

talk enough in stock to keep us up 
and at it half the night' 

The boy was right, and wise— the 
uncle acknowledged it. The boy was 
wise in another detail which he did not 
mention,— except to himself: ''Uncle 
and the others will come handy — in 
the way of nailing an alibi where it am 
can't be budged' 

He and his uncle talked diligently 
about three hours. Then, about mid- 
night, Fetlock stepped down stairs 
and took a position in the dark a 
dozen steps from the tavern, and 
waited. Five minutes later Flint 
Buckner came rocking out of the 
billiard-room and almost brushed him 
as he passed. 

"I've ot him!" muttered the boy. 


He continued to himself, looking after 
 the shadowy form: ''Good-by — good- 
by for good, Flint Buckner; you 

was called my mother a — well, never mind 

what; it's all right, now; you're taking 
your last walk, friend." 

He went musing back into the 
tavern. "From now till one is an 
hour. We'll spend it with the boys; 
it's good for the alibi." 

He brought Sherlock Holmes to 
the billiard-room, which was jammed 
with eager and admiring miners; the 
guest called the drinks, and the fun 
began. Everybody was happy; ev- 
erybody was complimentary; the ice 
was soon broken; songs, anecdotes, 
and more drinks followed, and the 
pregnant minutes flew. At six minutes
to one, when the jollity was at 
its highest — 

Boom! 

There was silence instantly. The 

deep sound came rolling and rumbling 

from peak to peak up the gorge, then 
died down, and ceased. The spell 
broke, then, and the men made a 
rush for the door, saying, 

"Something's blown up!" 

Outside, a voice in the darkness 
said, 

"It's away down the gorge; I saw 
the flash." 

The crowd poured down the can- 
yon — Holmes, Fetlock, Archy Still- 
man, everybody. They made the 
mile in a few minutes. By the light 
of a lantern they found the smooth 
and solid dirt floor of Flint Bvickner's 
cabin; of the cabin itself not a ves- 
tige remained, not a rag nor a splinter. 
Nor any sign of Flint. Search-par- 
ties sought here and there and yonder, 
and presently a cry went up. 

"Here he is!" 
Some It was true. Fifty yards down the 

'' gulch they had found him — that is, 
they had found a crushed and lifeless 
mass which represented him. Fet- 
lock Jones hurried thither with the 
others and looked. 

The inquest was a fifteen-minute 
affair. Ham Sandwich, foreman of 
the jury, handed up the verdict, which 
was phrased with a certain unstudied 
literary grace, and closed with this 
finding, to wit: that "deceased came 
to his death by his own act or some 
other person or persons unknown to 
this jury not leaving any family or 
similar effects behind but his cabin 
which was blown away and God 
have mercy on his soul amen' 

Then the impatient jury rejoined 
the main crowd, for the storm-cen- 
tre of interest was there — Sherlock 
Holmes. The miners stood silent and 
reverent in a half-circle, enclosing a 
large vacant space which included 
the front exposure of the site of the 
late premises. In this considerable 
space the Extraordinary Man was 
moving about, attended by his nephew 
with a lantern. With a tape he took 
measurements of the cabin site; of 
the distance from the wall of chaparral
to the road; of the height of the 
chaparral bushes; also various other 
measurements. He gathered a rag 
here, a splinter there, and a pinch 
of earth yonder, inspected them pro- 
foundly, and preserved them. He took 
the " lay " of the place with a pocket- 
compass, allowing t wo secon ds for 
magnetic variation. He took the time 
(Pacific) by his watch, correcting it 
for local time. He paced off the dis- 
tance from the cabin site to the corpse, 
and corrected that for tidal differen- 
tiation. He took the altitude with a 
pocket-aneroid, and the temperature 
with a pocket-thermometer. Finally 
he said, with a stately bow : 

"It is finished. Shall we return, 
gentlemen?'' 

He took up the line of march for the 
tavern, and the crowd fell into his 
wake, earnestly discussing and ad- 
miring the Extraordinary Man, and 
interlarding guesses as to the origin 
of the tragedy and who the author 
of it might be. 

"My, but it's grand luck having 

him here — hey, boys?'' said Ferguson. 

"It's the biggest thing of the cen- 
tury," said Ham Sandwich. "It 'll 
go all over the world ; you mark my 
words." 

''You bet!" said Jake Parker the 
blacksmith. "It 'll boom this camp. 
Ain't it so, Wells-Fargo?" 

"Well, as you want m y opinion — 
if it's any sign of how I think about 
it, I can tell you this : yesterday I was 
holding the Straight Flush claim at 
two dollars a foot; Vd like to see the 
man that can get it at sixteen to- 
day' 

"Right you are, Wells-Fargol It's 
ofdel the grandest luck a new camp ever 
struck. Say, did you see him collar 
them little rags and dirt and things? 
What an eye ! He just can't over- 
look a clew — 'tain't in him." 

"That's so. And they wouldn't 
mean a thing to anybody else; but 
to him, why, they're just a book — 
large print at that." 

"Sure's you're born! Them odds 
and ends have got their little old secret, 
and they think there ain't anybody 
can pull it; but, land! when he sets 
his grip there they've got to squeal, 
and don't you forget it." 

"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he 
wasn't here to roust out the child;  
this is a bigger thing, by a long sight. 
Yes, sir, and more tangled up and 
scientific and intellectual.'' 

"I reckon we're all of us glad it's 
turned out this way. Glad? 'George! 
it ain't any name for it. Dontchu- 
know, Archy could 've learnt some- 
thing if he'd had the nous to stand by 
and take notice of how that man works 
the system. But no; he went poking 
up into the chaparral and just missed 
the whole thing." 

"It's true as gospel; I seen it 
myself. Well, Archy's young. He'll 
know better one of these days." 

"Say, boys, who do you reckon 
done it?'' 

That was a difficult question, and 
brought out a world of unsatisfying 
conjecture. Various men were men- 
tioned as possibilities, but one by one 
they were discarded as not being eli- 
gible. No one but young Hillyer had 
been intimate with Flint Buckner; no 
one had really had a quarrel with him ; 
he had affronted every man who had 
tried to make up to him, although not 
quite offensively enough to require 
bloodshed. There was one name that 
was upon every tongue from the start, 
but it was the last to get utterance 
— Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley 
that mentioned it. 

"Oh, well," the boys said, "of 
course weVe all thought of him, be- 
cause he had a million rights to kill 
Flint Buckner, and it was just his 
plain duty to do it. But all the same 
there's two things we can't get around : 
for one thing, he hasn't got the sand ; 
and for another, he wasn't anywhere 
near the place when it happened." 

"I know it," said Pat. "He was 
there in the billiard - room with us 
when it happened." 

" Yes, and was there all the time for 
an hour bejore it happened." 

"It's so. And lucky for him, too. 
He'd have been suspected in a minute 
if it hadn't been for that." 

HE tavern dining-room 
had been cleared of all 
its furniture save one 
six-foot pine table and 
a chair. This table was against one 
end of the room; the chair was on it; 
Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, 
impressive, sat in the chair. The 
public stood. The room was full. 
The tobacco smoke was dense, the 
stillness profound. 

The Extraordinary Man raised his 
hand to clomnand additional silence; 

held it in the air a few moments ; then, 
in brief, crisp terms he put forward 
question after question, and noted the Thinks 


answers with Um-ums, nods of the voice 

head, and so on. By this process he 
learned all about Flint Buckner, his 
character, conduct, and habits, that 
the people were able to tell him. It 
thus transpired that the Extraordinary 
Man's nephew was the only person in 
the camp who had a killing-grudge 
against Flint Buckner. Mr. Holmes 
smiled compassionately upon the wit- 
ness, and asked, languidly — 

''Do any of you gentlemen chance 
to know where the lad Fetlock Jones 
was at the time of the explosion?" 
A thunderous response followed — 
" In the billiard-room of this house !" 



" Ah. And had he just come in?'' 
Just "Been there all of an hour!'' 

Uons "Ah. It is about — about — well, 

about how far might it be to the scene 
of the explosion?" 

"All of a mile!" 

" Ah. It isn't much of an alibi, 'tis 
true, but—" 

A storm-burst of laughter, mingled 
with shouts of, " By jiminy, but he's
