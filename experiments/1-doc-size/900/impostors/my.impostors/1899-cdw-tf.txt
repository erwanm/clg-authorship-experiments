disturbance ; it was suffused with blushes, coming 
and going in passionate emotion ; the eyes no 
longer blazed, but were softened in a melting 
tenderness of sympathy, and her whole person 
seemed to be carried into the stream of the 
great life passion. "When it ceased she sank 
back in her seat, and blushed still more, as if 
in fear that some one had discovered her secret. 

Afterwards, when Philip had an opportunity 
of knowing Evelyn Mavick, and knowing her 
very well, and to some extent having her con- 
fidence, he used to say to himself that he had 
little to learn— the soul of the woman was per- 
fectly revealed to him that night of " Siegfried." 

As the curtain went down, Mrs. Mavick, whose 
attention had not been specially given to the 
artists before, was clapping her hands in a great 
state of excitement. 

" Why don't you applaud, child ?" 

" Oh, mother," was all the girl could say, with 
heaving breast and downcast eyes. 



CHAPTER X 

All winter long that face seemed to get be- 
tween Philip and his work. It was an inspira- 
tion to his pen when it ran in the way of liter- 
ature, but a distinct damage to progress in his 
profession. He had seen Evelyn again, more 
than once, at the opera, and twice been excited 
by a passing glimpse of her on a crisp, sunny 
afternoon in the Mavick carriage in the Park — 
always the same bright, eager face. So vividly per- 
sonal was the influence upon him that it seemed 
impossible that she should not be aware of it — 
impossible that she could not know there was 
such a person in the world as Philip Burnett. 

Fortunately youth can create its own world. 
Between the secluded daughter of millions and 
the law clerk was a great gulf, but this did not 
prevent Evelyn's face, and, in moments of vanity, 
Evelyn herself, from belonging to Philip's world. 
He would have denied — we have a habit of lying 
to ourselves quite as much as to others — that he 
ever dreamed of possessing her, but nevertheless 
she entered into his thoughts and his future in a 




very curious way. If he saw himself a successful 
lawyer, her image appeared beside him. If his 
story should gain the public attention, and his 
occasional essays come to be talked of, it was 
Evelyn's interest and approval that he caught 
himself thinking about. And he had a convic- 
tion that she was one to be much more inter- 
ested in him as a man of letters than as a lawyer. 
This might be true. In Philip's story, which was 
very slowly maturing, the heroine fell in love 
with a young man simply for himself, and re- 
gardless of the fact that he was poor and had his 
career to make. But he knew that if his novel 
ever got published the critics would call it a ro- 
mance, and not a transcript of real life. Had not 
women ceased to be romantic and ceased to in- 
dulge in vagaries of affection ? 

Was it that Philip was too irresolute to cut 
either law or literature, and go in, single-minded, 
for a fortune of some kind, and a place ? Or was 
it merely that he had confidence in the winning 
character of his own qualities and was biding his 
time? If it was a question of making himself 
acceptable to a woman — say a woman like Evelyn 
— was it not belittling to his own nature to plan 
to win her by what he could make rather than 
by what he was? 

Probably the vision he had of Evelyn counted 
for very little in his halting decision. "Why 




 

don't you put her into a novel ?" asked Mr. Brad 
one evening. The suggestion was a shock. Philip 
conveyed the idea pretty plainly that he hadn't 
got so low as that yet. "Ah, you fellows think 
you must make your own material. You are 
higher -toned than old Dante." The fact was 
that Philip was not really halting. Every day 
he was less and less in love with the law as it 
was practised, and, courting reputation, he would 
much rather be a great author than a great law- 
yer. But he kept such thoughts to himself. He 
had inherited a very good stock of common-sense. 
Apparently he devoted himself to his office work, 
and about the occupation of his leisure hours no 
one was in his confidence except Celia, and now 
and then, when he got something into print, Alice. 
Professedly Celia was his critic, but really she 
was the necessary appreciator, for probably most 
writers would come to a stand-still if there was 
no sympathetic soul to whom they could com- 
municate, while they were fresh, the teeming 
fancies of their brains. 

The winter wore along without any incident 
worth recording, but still fruitful for the future, 
as Philip fondly hoped. And one day chance 
threw in his way another sensation. Late in the 
afternoon of a spring day he was sent from the 
office to Mavick's house with a bundle of papers 
to be examined and signed. 
Ill 



 

"Tou will be pretty sure to find him," said 
Mr. Sharp, "at home about six. Wait till you 
do see him. The papers must be signed and go 
to Washington by the night mail." 

Mr. Mavick was in his study, and received 
Philip very civilly, as the messenger of his law- 
yers, and was soon busy in examining the docu- 
ments, flinging now and then a short question to 
Philip, who sat at the table near him. 

Suddenly there was a tap at the door, and, not 
waiting for a summons, a young girl entered, and 
stopped after a couple of steps. 

" Oh, I didn't know—" 

"What is it, dear?" said Mr. Mavick, looking 
up a moment, and then down at the papers. 

" Why, about the coachman's baby. I thought 
perhaps — " She had a paper in her hand, and 
advanced towards the table, and then stopped, 
seeing that her father was not alone. 

Philip rose involuntarily. Mr. Mavick looked 
up quickly. " Yes, presently. Pve just now got 
a little business with Mr. Burnett." 

It was not an introduction. But for an instant 
the eyes of the young people met. It seemed to 
Philip that it was a recognition. Certainly the 
full, sweet eyes were bent on him for the second 
she stood there, before turning away and leaving 
the room. And she looked just as true and sweet 
as Philip dreamed she would look at home. He 




 

sat in a kind of maze for the quarter of an hour 
while Mavick was affixing his signature and giv- 
ing some directions. He heard all the directions, 
and he carried away the papers, but he also car- 
ried away something else unknown to the broker. 
After all, he found himself reflecting, as he walked 
down the avenue, the practice of the law has its 
good moments ! 

What was there in this trivial incident that 
so magnified it in Philip's mind, day after day ? 
"Was it that he began to feel that he had estab- 
lished a personal relation with Evelyn because 
she had seen him ? Nothing had really happened. 
Perhaps she had not heard his name, perhaps she 
did not carry the faintest image of him out of 
the room with her. Philip had read in romances 
of love at first sight, and he had personal expe- 
rience of it. Commonly, in romances, the woman 
gives no sign of it, does not admit it to herself, 
denies it in her words and in her conduct, and 
never owns it until the final surrender. " "When 
was the first moment you began to love me, 
dear?" "Why, the first moment, that day} 
didn't you know it then ?" This we are led to 
believe is common experience with the shy and 
secretive sex. It is enough, in a thousand reported 
cases, that he passed her window on horseback, 
and happened to look her way. But with such a 
look! The mischief was done. But this foun- 
H 



 

dation was too slight for Philip to build such a 
hope on. 

Looking back, we like to trace great results to 
insignificant, momentary incidents — a glance, a 
word, that turned the current of a life. There 
was a definite moment when the thought came 
to Alexander that he would conquer the world ! 
Probably there was no such moment. The great 
Alexander was restless, and at no initial instant 
did he conceive his scheme of conquest. Nor 
was it one event that set him in motion. We 
confound events with causes. It happened on 
such a day. Yes, but it might have happened 
on another. But if Philip had not been sent on 
that errand to Mavick probably Evelyn would 
never have met him. What nonsense this is, 
and what an unheroic character it makes Philip ! 
Is it supposable that, with such a romance as 
he had developed about the girl, he would not 
sometime have come near her, even if she had 
been locked up with all the bars and bolts of a 
safety deposit ? 

The incident of this momentary meeting was, 
however, of great consequence. There is no such 
feeder of love as the imagination. And fortunate 
it was for Philip that his romance was left to 
grow in the wonder-working process of his own 
mind. At first there had been merely a curiosity 
in regard to a person whose history and educa- 




 

tion had been peculiar. Then the sight of her 
had raised a strange tumult in his breast, and 
his fancy began to play about her image, seen 
only at a distance and not many times, until his 
imagination built up a being of surpassing love- 
liness, and endowed with all the attractions that 
the poets in all ages have given to the sex tliat 
inspires them. But this sort of creation in the 
mind becomes vague, and related to literature 
only, unless it is sustained by some reality. Even 
Petrarch must occasionally see Laura at the 
church door, and dwell upon the veiled dreamer 
that passed and perhaps paused a moment to re- 
gard him with sad eyes. Philip, no doubt, nursed 
a genuine passion, which grew into an exquisite 
ideal in the brooding of a poetic mind, but it 
might in time have evaporated into thin air, re- 
maining only as an emotional and educational 
experience. But this moment in Mr. Mavick's 
library had given a solid body to his imagina- 
tions, and a raore definite turn to his thought 
of her. 

If, in some ordinary social chance, Philip had 
encountered the heiress, without this previous 
wonder-working of his imagination in regard to 
her, the probability is that he would have seen 
nothing especially to distinguish her from the 
other girls of her age and newness in social ex- 
perience. Certainly the thought that she was 




 

the possessor of uncounted millions would have 
been, on his side, an insuperable barrier to any 
advance. But the imagination works wonders 
trulj'', and Philip saw the woman and not the 
heiress. She had become now a distinct person- 
ality, to be desired above all things on earth, and 
that he should see her again he had no doubt. 

This thought filled his mind, and even when 
he was not conscious of it gave a sort of color to 
life, refined his perceptions, and gave him al- 
most sensuous delight in the masterpieces of 
poetry which had formerly appealed only to bis 
intellectual appreciation of beauty. He had not 
yet come to a desire to share his secret with any 
confidant, but preferred to be much alone and 
muse on it, creating a world which was without 
evil, without doubt, undisturbed by criticism. 
In this so real dream it was the daily oflice work 
that seemed unreal, and the company and gossip 
of his club a kind of vain show. He began to 
frequent the picture-galleries, where there was 
at least an attempt to express sentiment, and to 
take long walks to the confines of the city — con- 
fines fringed with all the tender suggestions of 
the opening spring. Even the monotonous streets 
which he walked were illumined in his eyes, glo- 
rified by the fulness of life and achievement. 
" Yes," he said again and again, as he stood on 
the Heights, in view of the river, the green wall 




 

of Jersey and the great metropolis spread away 
to the ocean gate, " it is a beautiful city ! And 
the critics say it is commonplace and vulgar." 
Dear dreamer, it is a beautiful city, and for one 
reason and another a million of people who have 
homes there think so. But take out of it one 
person, and it would have for you no more in- 
terest than any other huge assembly of ugly 
houses. How, in a lover's eyes, the woman can 
transfigure a city, a landscape, a country ! 

Celia had come up to town for the spring ex- 
hibitions, and was lodging at the Woman's Club. 
Naturally Philip saw much of her, indeed gave 
her all his time that the office did not demand. 
Her company was always for him a keen delight, 
an excitement, and in its way a rest. For though 
she always criticised, she did not nag, and just 
because she made no demands, nor laid any 
claims on him, nor ever reproached him for want 
of devotion, her society was delightful and never 
dull. They dined together at the Woman's Club, 
they experimented on the theatres, they visited 
the galleries and the picture-shops, they took lit- 
tle excursions into the suburbs and came back 
impressed with the general cheapness and shab- 
biness, and they talked — talked about all they 
saw, all they had read, and something of what 
they thought. What was wanting to make this 
charming camaraderie perfect ? Only one thing. 




 

It may have occurred to Philip that Celia had 
not sufficient respect for his opinions; she re- 
garded them simply as opinions, not as his. 

One afternoon, in the Metropolitan Picture- 
Gallery, Philip had been expressing enthusiasm 
for some paintings that Celia thought more sen- 
timental than artistic, and this reminded her that 
he was getting into a general way of admiring 
everything. 

" You didn't use, Philip, to care so much for 
pictures." 

" Oh, Pve been seeing more." 

" But you don't say you like that ? Look at 
the drawing." 

" Well, it tells the story." 

" A story is nothing ; it's the way it's told. 
This is not well told." 

" It pleases me. Look at that girl." 

"Yes, she is domestic. I admit that. But 
I'm not sure I do not prefer an impressionistic 
girl, whom you can't half see, to such a thorough 
bread-and-butter miss as this." 

" Which would you rather live with ?" 

" I'm not obliged to live with either. In fact, 
I'd rather live with myself. If it's art, I want 
art ; if it's cooking and sewing, I want cooking 
and sewing. If the artist knew enough, he'd 
paint a woman instead of a cook." 

" Then you don't care for real life ?" 




 

" Keal life ! There is no such thing. Y"ou are 
demonstrating that. You transform this unin- 
teresting piece of domesticity into an ideal wom- 
an, ennobling her surroundings. She doesn't do 
it. She is level with them." 

" It would be a dreary world if we didn't 
idealize things." 

" So it would. And that is what I complain 
of in such ' art ' as this. I don't know what has 
got into you, Phil. I never saw you so exu- 
berant. You are pleased with everything. Have 
you had a rise in the office? Have you finished 
your novel?" 

" Neither. No rise. No novel. But Tweedle 
is getting friendly. Threw an extra job in my 
way the other day. Do you think I'd better 
offer my novel, when it is done, to Tweedle ?" 

" Tweedle, indeed !" 

" Well, one of our clients is one of the great 
publishing firms, and Tweedle often dines with 
the publisher." 

" For shame, Phil !" 

Philip laughed. "At any rate, that is no 
meaner than a suggestion of Brad's. He says if 
I will just weave into it a lot of line scenery, and 
set my people travelling on the great trunk, stop- 
ping off now and then at an attractive branch, 
the interested railroads would gladly print it and 
scatter it all over the country." 





^  

"No doubt," said Celia, sinking down upon a 
convenient seat. "I begin to feel as if there 
were no protection for anything. And, Phil, 
that great monster of a Mavick, who is eating up 
the country, isn't he a client also?" 

" Occasionally only. A man like Mavick has 
his own lawj'ers and judges." 

" Did you ever see him ?" 

"Just glimpses." 

" And that daughter of his, about whom such 
a fuss was made, I suppose you never met her ?" 

" Oh, as I wrote you, at the opera ; saw her in 
her box." 

"And—!" 

" Oh, she's rather a little thing ; rather dark, 
I told you that ; seems devoted to music." 

" And j^ou didn't tell what she wore." 

" Why, what they all wear. Something light 
and rather fluffy." 

" Just like a man. Is she pretty ?" 

"Ye-e-s; has that effect. You'd notice her 
eyes." If Philip had been frank he would have 
answered, " I don't know. She's simply ador- 
able," and Celia would have understood all 
about it. 

" And probably doesn't know anything. Yes, 
highly educated ? I heard that. But I'm get- 
ting tired of 'highly educated' ; I see so many of 
them. I've been making them now for years. 




 

Perhaps I'm one of them. And where am I ? 
Don't interrupt. I tell you it is a relief to come 
across a sweet, womanly ignoramus. "What 
church does she go to?" 

" Who ?" 

" That Mavick girl." 

" St. Thomas's, I believe." 

"That's good — that's devotional. I suppose 
you go there too, being brought up a Congrega- 
tionalist ?" 

" At vespers, sometimes. But, Celia, what is 
the matter with you ? I thought you didn't care 
— didn't care to belong to anything ?" 

" I ? I belong to everything. Didn't I write 
you reams about my studies in psychology ? I've 
come to one conclusion. There are only two per- 
sons in the world who stand on a solid founda- 
tion, the Roman Catholic and the Agnostic. The 
Roman Catholic knows everything, the Agnostic 
doesn't know anything." 

Philip was never certain when the girl was 
bantering him ; nor, when she was in earnest, 
how long she would remain in that mind and 
mood. So he ventured, humorously : 

" The truth is, Celia, that you know too much 
to be either. Tou are what they call emanci- 
pated." 

" Emancipated !" And Celia sat up energeti- 
cally, as if she were now really interested in 





r 
 

the conversation. " Become the slave of myself 
instead of the slave of somebody else ! That's 
the most hateful thing to be, emancipated. I 
never knew a woman who said she was emanci- 
pated who wasn't in some ridiculous folly or an- 
other. Now, Phil, I'm going to tell you some- 
thing. I can tell you. You know I've been 
striving to have a career, to get out of myself 
somehow, and have a career for myself. "Well, 
to-day — mind, I don't say to-morrow" — (and 
there was a queer little smile on her lips) — "I 
think I will just try to be good to people and 
things in general, in a human way." 

" And give up education ?" 

" No, no. I get my living by education, just 
as you do, or hope to do, by law or by letters ; 
it's all the same. But wait. I haven't finished 
what I was going to say. The more I go into 
psychology, trying to find out about my mind 
and mind generally, the more mysterious every- 
thing is. Do you know, Phil, that I am getting 
into the supernatural? You can't help running 
into it. For me, I am not side-tracked by any 
of the nonsense about magnetism and telepathy 
and mind-reading and other psychic impondera- 
bilities. Isn't it queer that the further we go 
into science the deeper we go into mystery ? 
Now, don't be shocked, I mean it reverently, just 
as an illustration. Do you think any one knows 




 

really anything more about the operation in the 
world of electricity than he does about the oper- 
ation of the Holy Ghost ? And yet people talk 
about science as if it were something they had 
made themselves." 

" But, Celia— " 

" ISTo, I've talked enough. We are in this world 
and not in some other, and I have to make my 
living. Let's go into the other room and see the 
old masters. They, at least, knew how to paint 
— to paint passion and character ; some of them 
could paint soul. And then, Phil, I shall be 
hungry. Talking about the mind always makes 
me hungry." 



CHAPTER XI 

Philip was always welcome at his uncle's house 
in Eivervale. It was, of course, his home during 
his college life, and since then he was always ex- 
pected for his yearly holiday. The women of the 
house made much of him, waited on him, deferred 
to him, petted him, with a flattering mingling of 
tenderness to a little boy and the respect due to 
a man who had gone into the world. Even Mr. 
Maitland condescended to a sort of equality in 
engaging Philip in conversation about the state 
of the country and the prospects of business in 
New York. 

It was July. When Philip went to sleep at 
night — he was in the front chamber reserved for 
guests — the loud murmur of the Deerfield was in 
his ears, like a current bearing him away into 
sweet sleep and dreams in a land of pleasant ad- 
ventures. Only in youth come such dreams. 
Later on the sophisticated mind, left to its own 
guidance in the night, wanders amid the com- 
plexities of life, calling up in confusion scenes 
long forgotten or repented of, images only regis- 




 

tered by a sub-conscious process, dreams to per- 
plex, irritate, and excite. 

In the morning the same continuous murmur 
seemed to awake him into a peaceful world. 
Through the open window came in the scents 
of summer, the freshness of a new day. How 
sweet and light was the air ! It was indeed the 
height of summer. The coi'n, not yet tasselled, 
stood in green flexible ranks, moved by the early 
breeze. In the river-meadows haying had just 
begun. Fields of timothy and clover, yellowing 
to ripeness, took on a fresh bloom from the dew, 
and there was an odor of new-mown grass from 
the sections where the scythes had been. He 
heard the call of the crow from the hill, the mel- 
ody of the bobolink along the meadow-brook ; 
indeed, the birds of all sorts were astir, skimming 
along the ground or rising to the sky, keeping 
watch especially over the garden and the fruit- 
trees, carrying food to their nests, or teaching 
their young broods to fly and to chirp the songs 
of summer. And from the wood-shed the shrill 
note of the scythe under the action of the grind- 
stone. No such vivid realization of summer as 
that. 

Philip stole out the unused front door without 

disturbing the family. Whither? Where would 

a boy be likely to go the first thing? To the 

barn, the great cavernous barn, its huge doors 





 

now wide open, the stalls vacant, the mows 
empty, the sunlight sifting in through the high 
shadowy spaces. How much his life had been 
in that barn ! How he had stifled and scrambled 
mowing hay in those lofts ! On the floor he had 
hulled heaps of corn, thrashed oats with a flail — 
a noble occupation — and many a rainy day had 
played there with girls and boys who could not 
now exactly describe the games or well recall 
what exciting fun they were. There were the 
racks where he put the fodder for cattle and 
horses, and there was the cutting-machine for 
the hay and straw and for slicing the frozen tur- 
nips on cold winter mornings. 

In the barn-yard were the hens, just as usual, 
walking with measured step, scratching and pick- 
ing in the muck, darting suddenly to one side 
with an elevated wing, clucking, chattering, jab- 
bering endlessly about nothing. They did not 
seem to mind him as he stood in the open door. 
But the rooster, in his oriental iridescent plu- 
mage, jumped upon a fence-post and crowed de- 
fiantly, in warning that this was his preserve. 
They seemed like the same hens, yet Philip knew 
they were all strangers ; all the hens and flaunt- 
ing roosters he knew had long ago gone to 
Thanksgiving. The hen is, or should be, an 
annual. It is never made a pet. It forms no 
attachments. Man is no better acquainted with 




 

tlie hen, as a being, than he was when the first 
chicken was hatched. Its business is to live a 
brief chicken life, lay, and be eaten. And this 
reminded Philip that his real occupation was 
hunting hens' eggs. And this he did, in the 
mows, in the stalls, under the floor -planks, in 
every hidden nook. The hen's instinct is to be 
orderly, and have a secluded nest of her own, and 
bring up a family. But in such a communistic 
body it is a wise hen who knows her own chicken. 
Nobody denies to the hen maternal instincts or 
domestic proclivities, but what an ill example is 
a hen community! 

And then Philip climbed up the hill, through 
the old grass-plot and the orchard, to the rocks 
and the forest edge, and the great view. It had 
more meaning to him than when he was a boy, 
and it was more beautiful. In a certain peace- 
ful charm, he had seen nothing anywhere in the 
world like it. Partly this was because his boyish 
impressions, the first fresh impressions of the 
visible world, came back to him ; but surely it 
was very beautiful. More experienced travellers 
than Philip felt its unique charm. 

When he descended, Alice was waiting to 
breakfast with him. Mrs. Maitland declared, 
with an approving smile on her placid, aging 
face, that he was the same good-for-nothing boy. 
But Alice said, as she sat down to the little table 




 

with Philip, " It is different, mother, with us 
city folks." They were in the middle room, and 
the windows opened to the west upon the river- 
meadows and the wooded hills beyond, and 
through one a tall rose-bush was trying to thrust 
its fragrant bloom. 

What a dainty breakfast ! Alice flushed with 
pleasure. It was so good of him to come to 
them. Had he slept well ? Did it seem like 
home at all? Philip's face showed that it was 
home without the need of saying so. Such cof- 
fee — yes, a real aroma of the berr^' ! Just a little 
more, would he have ? And as Alice raised the 
silver pitcher, there was a deep dimple in her 
sweet cheek. How happy she was ! And then 
the butter, so fresh and cool, and the delicious 
eggs — by the way, he had left a hatful in the 
kitchen as he came in. Alice explained that she 
did not make the eggs. And then there was the 
journey, the heat in the city, the grateful sight 
of the Deerfield, the splendid morning, the old 
barn, the watering -trough, the view from the 
hill — everything just as it used to be. 

"Dear Phil, it is so nice to have you here," 
and there were tears in Alice's eyes, she was so 
happy. 

After breakfast Philip strolled down the coun- 
try road through the village. How familiar was 
every step of the way ! — the old houses jutting 




 

out at the turns in the road ; the glimpse of the 
river beyond the little meadow where Captain 
Eice was killed ; the spring under the ledge over 
which the snap-dragon grew ; the dilapidated 
ranks of fence smothered in vines and fire- weeds ; 
the cottages, with flower-pots in front ; the stores, 
with low verandas ornamented with boxes and 
barrels ; the academy in its green on the hill ; the 
old bridge over which the circus elephant dared 
not walk ; the new and the old churches, with 
rival steeples ; and, not familiar, the new inn. 

And he knew everybody, young and old, at 
doorways, in the fields or gardens, and had for 
every one a hail and a greeting. How he enjoyed 
it all, and his self-consciousness added to his pleas- 
ure, as he swung along in his well-fitting city 
clothes, broad-shouldered and erect — it is aston- 
ishing how much a tailor can do for a man who 
responds to his efforts. It is a pleasure to come 
across such a hero as this in real life, and not 
have to invent him, as the saying is, out of the 
whole cloth. Philip enjoyed the world, and he 
enjoyed himself, because it was not quite his old 
self, the farmer's boy going on an errand. There 
must be knowledge all along the street that he 
was in the great law office of Hunt, Sharp & 
Tweedle. And, besides, Philip's name must be 
known to all the readers of magazines in the 
town as a writer, a name in more than one list 
I 



 

of " contributors." That was fame. Translated, 
however, into country comprehension it was 
something like this, if he could have heard the 
comments after he had passed by : 

" Yes, that's Phil Burnett, sure enough; but I'd 
hardly know him ; spruced up mightily. I won- 
der what he's at ?" 

" I heard he was down in 'New York trying to 
law it. I heard he's been writin' some for news- 
papers. Accordin' to his looks, must pay a durn 
sight better'n farmin'." 

" "Well, I always said that boy wa'n't no skee- 
zics." 

Almost the first question Philip asked Alice 
on his return was about the new inn, the Pea- 
cock Inn. 

" There seemed a good deal of stir about it as 
I passed." 

" "Why, I forgot to tell you about it. It's the 
great excitement. Eivervale is getting known. 
The Mavicks are there. I hear they've taken 
pretty much the whole of it." 

"The Mavicks?" 

" Yes, the New York Mavicks, that you wrote 
us about, that were in the paper." 

" How long have they been there ?" 

"A week. There is Mrs. Mavick and her 
daughter, and the governess, and two maids, and 
a young fellow in uniform — yes, livery — and a 




 

coachman in the same, and a stableful of horses 
and carriages. It upset the village like a circus. 
And they say there's a French clief in white cap 
and apron, who comes to the side-door and jab- 
bers to the small boys like fireworks." 
" How did it come about ?" 
" Naturally, I guess; a city family wanting a 
quiet place for summer in the country. But you 
will laugh. Patience first discovered it. One 
day, sitting at the window, she saw a two-horse 
buggy driven by the landlord of the Peacock, 
and a gentleman by his side. 'Well, I wonder 
who that is — city man certainly. And wherever 
is he going ? May be a railroad man. But there 
is nothing the matter with the railroad. Shouldn't 
wonder if he is going to see the tunnel. If it 
was just that, the landlord wouldn't drive him ; 
he'd send a man. And they keep stopping and 
pointing and looking round. No, it isn't the rail- 
road, it's scenery. And what can a man like that 
want with scenery ? He does look like a railroad 
man. It may be tunnel, but it isn't all tun- 
nel.' When the team came back in the after- 
noon, Patience was again at the window ; she 
had heard meantime from Jabez that a city man 
was stopping at the Peacock. ' There he goes, 
and looking round more than ever. They've 
stopped by the bridge and the landlord is point- 
ing out. It's not tunnel, it's scenery. I tell you, 




 

he is a city boarder. Not that he cares about 
scenery ; it's for his family. City families are al- 
ways trying to find a grand new place, and he 
has heard of Eivervale and the Peacock Inn. 
Maybe the tunnel had something to do with it.' " 

" Why, it's like second sight." 

" No, Patience says it's just judgment. And 
she generally hits it. At any rate, the family is
