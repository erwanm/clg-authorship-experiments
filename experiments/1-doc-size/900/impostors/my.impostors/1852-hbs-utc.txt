tired monster, to prepare to push up among the multiplied 
steamers at the levee. Eva joyously pointed out the various 
spires, domes, and way-marks, by which she recognised her 
native city. 

" Yes, yes, dear ; very fine," said Miss Ophelia. " But 
mercy on us ! the boat has stopped ! where is your father ?" 

And now ensued the usual turmoil of landing waiters 
running twenty ways at once men tugging trunks, carpet- 
bags, boxes women anxiously calling to their children, and 
everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank towards 
the landing. ' * 

Miss Ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately van- 
quished trunk, and marshalling all her goods and chattels 
in fine military order, seemed resolved to defend them to 
the last. 

" Shall I take your trunk, ma'am ?" " Shall I take your 
baggage ? " " Let me 'tend to your baggage, missis." 
"Shan't I carry out these yer, missis?" rained down upon 
her unheeded. She sat with grim determination, upright as 
a darning-needle stuck in a board, holding on her bundle of 
umbrella and parasols, and replying with a determination 
that was enough to strike dismay even into a hackman, wondering to Eva, in each interval, " what upon earth her papa 
could be thinking of ; he couldn't have fallen over, now but 
something must have happened ;" and just as she had begun 
to work herself into a real distress, he came up with his 
usually careless motion, and giving Eva a quarter of the 
orange he was eating ,said 

" Well, Cousin Vermont, I suppose you are all ready ?" 

"I've been ready, waiting, nearly an hour," said Miss 
Ophelia ; " began to be really concerned about you." 

" That's a clever fellow, now," said he. " Well, the carriage is waiting, and the crowd are now off, so that one can 
walk out in a decent and Christian manner, and not be 
pushed and shoved. Here," he added to a driver who stood 
behind him, " take these things." 

" I'll go and see to his putting them in," said Miss Ophelia. 





" Oh, pshaw ! cousin ; what's the use ?" said St. Clare. 

"Well, at any rate, I'll carry this, and this, and this," 
said Miss Ophelia, singling out three boxes and a small 
carpet-bag. 

" My dear Miss Vermont, positively you mustn't come the 
Green Mountains over us that way. You must adopt at 
least a piece of a southern principle, and not walk out under 
all that load. They'll take you for a waiting-maid ; give 
them to this fellow ; he'll put them down as if they were 
eggs, now." 

Miss Ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all 
her treasures from her, and rejoiced to find herself once 
more in a carriage with them in a state of preservation. 

" Where's Tom P" said Eva. 

" Oh, he's on the outside, pussy. I'm going to take Tom 
up to mother for a peace-offering, to make up for that 
drunken fellow that upset the carriage." 

" Oh, Torn will make a splendid driver, I know," said 
Eva ; "he'll never get drunk." 

The carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion, built 
in that odd mixture of Spanish and French style, of which 
there are specimens in some parts of New. Orleans. It was 
built in the Moorish fashion a square building enclosing a 
court-yard, into which the carriage drove through an arched 
gateway. The court, in the inside, had evidently been 
arranged to gratify a picturesque and voluptuous ideality. 
Wide galleries ran all around the four sides, whose Moorish 
arches, slender pillars, and arabesque ornaments, carried the 
mind back, as in a dream, to the reign of Oriental romance 
in Spain. In the middle of the court, a fountain threw 
high its silvery water, falling in a never-ceasing spray into a 
marble basin, fringed with a deep border of fragrant violets. 
The water in the fountain, pellucid as crystal, was alive with 
myriads of gold and silver fishes, twinkling and darting 
through it like so many living jewels. Around the fountain 
ran a walk, paved with a mosaic of pebbles, laid in various 
fanciful patterns ; and this again was surrounded by turf, 
smooth as green velvet, while a carriage-drive inclosed the 
whole. Two large orange-trees, now fragrant with blossoms, 
threw a delicious shade ; and, ranged in a circle round upon 
the turf were marble vases of arabesque sculpture, containing 





the choicest flowering plants of the tropics. Huge pomegranate trees, with their glossy leaves and name-coloured 
flowers, dark-leaved Arabian jessamines, with their silvery 
stars, geraniums, luxuriant roses bending beneath their 
heavy abundance of flowers, golden jessamines, lemon-scented 
verbena, all united their bloom and fragrance, while here and 
there a mystic old aloe, with its strange, massive leaves, sat 
looking like some hoary old enchanter, sitting in weird 
grandeur among the more perishable bloom and fragrance 
around it. 

The galleries that surrounded the court were festooned 
with a curtain of some kind of Moorish stuff, and could be 
drawn down at pleasure to exclude the beams of the sun. On 
the whole, the appearance of the place was luxurious and 
romantic. 

As the carriage drove in, Eva seemed like a bird ready to 
burst from a cage, with the wild eagerness of her delight. 

" Oh, isn't it beautiful, lovely ! My own, dear, darling 
home ! " she said to Miss Ophelia. " Isn't it beautiful ? " 

" 'Tis a pretty place," said Miss Ophelia, as she alighted ; 
" though it looks rather old and heathenish to me." 

Tom got down from the carriage, and looked about with an 
air of calm, still enjoyment. The negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries 
of the world, and he has deep in his heart a passion for all 
that is splendid, rich, and fanciful ; a passion which, rudely 
indulged by an untrained taste, draws on them the ridicule 
of the colder and more correct white race. 

St. Clair, who was in his heart a poetical voluptuary, 
smiled as Miss Ophelia made her remark on his premises, 
and, turning to Tom, who was standing looking round, his 
beaming black face perfectly radiant with admiration, he 



Tom, my boy, this seems to suit you." 

" Tes, mas'r, it looks about the right thing," said Tom. 

All this passed in a moment, while trunks were being 
hustled off, hackman paid, and while a crowd of all ages and 
sizes men, women, and children, came running through the 
galleries, both above and below, to see mas'r come in. Foremost among them was a highly-dressed young mulatto man, 
evidently a very distingue personage, attired in the ultra 





extreme of the mode, and gracefully waving a scented 
cambric handkerchief in his hand. 

This personage had been exerting himself, with great 
alacrity, in driving all the flock of domestics to the other 
end of the verandah. 

" Back ! all of you. I am ashamed of you," he said in a 
tone of authority. "Would you intrude on master's domestic 
relations, in the first hour of his return ? " 

All looked abashed at this elegant speech, delivered with 
quite an air, and stood huddled together at a respectful distance, except two stout porters, who came up and began 
conveying away the baggage. 

Owing to Mr. Adolph's systematic arrangements, when 
St. Clair turned round from paying the hackinan, there was 
nobody in view but Mr. Adolph himself, conspicuous in 
satin vest, gold guard-chain, and white pants, and bowing 
with inexpressible grace and suavity. 

" Ah, Adolph, is it you?" said his master, offering his 
hand to him ; " how are you, boy ? " while Adolph poured 
forth, with great fluency, an extemporary speech, which he 
had been preparing, with great care, for a fortnight before. 

" Well, well," said St. Clare, passing on, with his usual 
air of negligent drollery, " that's very well got up, Adolph. 
See that the baggage is well bestowed. I'll come to the 
people in a minute;" and so saying, he led Miss Ophelia to 
a large parlour that opened on to the verandah. 

While this had been passing, Eva had flown like a bird 
through the porch and parlour, to a little boudoir opening 
likewise on the verandah. 

A tall, dark-eyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on 
which she was reclining. 

" Mamma ! " said Eva, in a sort of rapture, throwing 
herself on her neck, and embracing her over and over again. 

" That'll do take care, child don't you make my head 
ache ! " said the mother, after she had languidly kissed her. 

St. Clare came in, embraced his wife, in true, orthodox, 
husbandly fashion, and then presented to her his cousin. 
Marie lifted her large eyes on her cousin with an air of some 
curiosity, and received her with languid politeness. A 
crowd of servants now pressed to the entry door, and among 
them a middle-aged mulatto woman, of very respectable 





appearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and 
joy, at the door. 

" Oh, there's Mammy ! " said Eva, as she flew across the 
room ; and, throwing herself into her arms, she kissed her 
repeatedly. 

This woman did not tell her that she made her head ache, 
but, on the contrary, she hugged her, and laughed, and cried, 
till her sanity was a thing to be doubted of; and when 
released from her, Eva flew from one to another, shaking 
hands and kissing, in a way that Miss Ophelia afterwards 
declared fairly turned her stomach. 

" Well ! " said Miss Ophelia, " you southern children can 
do something that I couldn't." 

" What, now, pray ? " said St. Clare. 

" Well, I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn't 
have anything hurt ; but, as to kissing " 

" Niggers," said St. Clare, " that you're not up to ; eh ? " 

" Yes, that's it. How can she ? " 

St. Clare laughed as he went into the passage. " Halloa ! 
here, what's to pay out here ? Here, you all Mammy, 
Jimmy, Polly, Sukey glad to see mas'r ? " he said, as he 
went shaking hands from one to another. " Look out for the 
babies !" he added, as he stumbled over a sooty little urchin, 
who was crawling upon all-fours. " If I step upon anybody, 
let 'em mention it." 

There was an abundance of laughing and blessing mas'r, 
as St. Clare distributed small pieces of change among them. 

" Come, now, take yourselves off, like good boys and 
girls," he said ; and the whole assemblage, dark and light, 
disappeared through a door into a large verandah, followed 
by Eva, who carried a large satchel, which she had been 
filling with apples, nuts, candy, ribbons, laces, and toys of 
every description, during her whole homeward journey. 

As St. Clare turned to go back, his eye fell upon Tom, 
who was standing uneasily, shifting from one foot to the 
other, while Adolph stood negligently leaning against the 
banisters, examining Tom through an opera-glass, with an 
air that would have done credit to any dandy living. 

"Puh! you puppy," said his master, striking down the 
opera-glass ; " is that the way you treat your company ? 
Seems to me, Dolph," he added, laying his finger on the 

 





elegant figured satin vest that Adolph was sporting, " seems 
to me that's my vest." 

" Oh ! master, this vest all stained with wine ! of 
course a gentleman in master's standing never wears a vest 
like this. I understood I was to take it. It does for a poor 
nigger-feller, like me." 

And Adolph tossed his head, and passed his fingers 
through his scented hair, with a grace. 

" So, that's it, is it ? " said St. Clare, carelessly. " "Well, 
here, I'm going to show this Tom to his mistress, and then 
you take him to the kitchen ; and mind you don't put on 
any of your airs to him. He's worth two such puppies as 
you.' 

" Master always will have his joke," said Adolph, laughing. " I'm delighted to see master in such spirits." 

" Here, Tom," said St. Clare, beckoning. 

Tom entered the room. He looked wistfully on the 
velvet carpets, and the before unimagined splendours of 
mirrors, pictures, statues, and curtains, and, like the Queen 
of Sheba before Solomon, there was no more spirit in him. 
He looked afraid even to set his feet down. 

" See .Vere, Marie," said St. Clare to his wife, " I've 
bought yoi a coachman, at last, to order. I tell you he's a 
regular hearse for blackness and Luoriety, and will drive you 
like a funeral, if you want. Open your eyes, now, and look 
at him. Now, don't say I never think about you when I'm 
gone." 

Marie opened her eyes, and fixed them on Tom, without 
rising. 

" I know he'll get drunk," she said. 

" No, he's warranted a pious and sober article." 

" Well, I hope he may turn out well," said the lady; "it's 
more than I expect, though." 

"Dolph," said St. Clare, "show Tom down stairs; and 
mind yourself," he added ; " remember what I told you." 

Adolph tripped gracefully forward, and Tom, with lumbering tread, went after. 

" He's a perfect behemoth !" said Marie. 

" Come, now, Marie," said St. Clare, seating himself on a 
stool beside her sofa, " be gracious, and say something pret
to a follow." 





" You've  been gone a fortnight beyond the time," said the 
lady, pouting. 

" Well, you know I wrote you the reason." 

" Such a short, cold letter f" said the lady. 

" Dear me ! the mail was just going, and it had to be that 
or nothing." 

"That's just the way always," said the lady; "always 
something to make your journeys long, and letters short." 

" See here, now," he added, drawing an elegant velvet case 
out of his pocket, and opening it, " here's a present I got for 
you in New York." It was a daguerreotype, clear and soft 
as an engraving, representing Eva and her father sitting 
hand in hand. 

Marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air. 

" What made you sit in such an awkward position ?" she 
said. 

" Well, the position may be a matter of opinion ; but what 
do you think of the likeness ?" 

" If you don't think anything of my opinion in one case, I 
suppose you wouldn't in another," said the lady, shutting the 
daguerreotype. 

" Hang the woman !" said St. Clare, mentally ; but aloud 
he added, " Come, now, Marie, what do you think of the 
likeness ? Don't be nonsensical, now." 

" It's very inconsiderate of you, St. Clare," said the lady, 
" to insist on my talking and looking at things. You know 
I've been lying all day with the sick-headache ; and there's 
been such a tumult made ever since you came, I'm half 
dead." 

"You're subject to the sick-headache, ma'am ?" said Miss 
Ophelia, suddenly rising from the depths of the large arm- 
chair, where she had sat quietly, taking an inventory of the 
furniture, and calculating its expense. 

" Yes, I'm a perfect martyr to it," said the lady. 

" Juniper-berry tea is good for sick-headache," said Miss 
Ophelia ; " at least, Augustine, Deacon Abraham Perry's 
wife, used to say so ; and she was a great nurse." 

" I'll have the first juniper-berries that get ripe in our 
garden by the lake brought in for that especial purpose," 
said St. Clare, gravely pulling the bell as he did so; 
" meanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting to retire to your 







apartment, and refresh yourself a little after your journey. 
Dolph," he added, " tell Mammy to come here." The decent 
mulatto woman whom Eva had caressed so rapturously soon 
entered ; she was dressed neatly, with a high red and yellow 
turban on her head, the recent gift of Eva, and which the 
child had been arranging on her head. " Mammy," said St. 
Clare, " I put this lady under your care ; she is tired, and 
wants rest. Take her to her chamber, and be sure she is 
made comfortable;" and Miss Ophelia disappeared in the 
rear of Mammy. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

TOM'S MISTRESS AND HER OPINIONS. 

"AND now, Marie," said St. Clare, "your golden days are 
dawning. Here is our practical, business-like New England 
cousin, who will take the whole budget of cares off your 
shoulders, and give you time to refresh yourself, and grow 
young and handsome. The ceremony of delivering the keys 
had better come off forthwith." 

This remark was made at the breakfast-table, a few 
mornings after Miss Ophelia had arrived. 

" I'm sure she's welcome," said Marie, leaning her head 
languidly on her hand. " I think she'll find one thing, if she 
does, and that is, that it's we mistresses that are the slaves, 
down here." 

" Oh, certainly, she will discover that, and a world of 
wholesome truths besides, no doubt," said St. Clare. 

" Talk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our 
convenience'' said Marie. " I'm sure, if we consulted that, 
we might let them all go at once." 

Evangeline fixed her large, serious eyes on her mother's 
face, with an earnest and perplexed expression, and said 
simply, " What do you keep them for, mamma ? " 

" I don't know, I'm sure, except for a plague ; they are 
the plague of my life. I believe that more of my ill- 
health is caused by them than by any one thing ; and 





ours, I know, are the very worst that ever anybody was 
plagued with." 

" Oh, come, Marie, you've got the blues this morning," 
said St. Clare. " You know 'tisn't so. There's Mammy, the 
best creature living what could you do without her ? " 

" Mammy is the best I ever knew," said Marie ; " and 
yet Mammy, now, is selfish dreadfully selfish ; it's the fault 
of the whole race." 

" Selfishness is a dreadful fault," said St. Clare, gravely. 

" Well, now, there's Mammy," said Marie ; " I think it's 
selfish of her to sleep so sound nights ; she knows I need 
little attentions almost every hour, when my worst turns are 
on, and yet she's so hard to wake. I absolutely am worse, 
this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her 
last night." 

" Hasn't she sat up with you a good many nights lately, 
mamma ? " said Eva. 

" How should you know that ? " said Marie, sharply ; 
" she's been complaining, I suppose." 

" She didn't complain ; she only told me what bad nights 
you'd had so many in succession ! " 

" Why don't you let Jane or Rosa take her place a night 
or two," said St. Clare, "and let her rest ? " 

" How can you propose it ? " said Marie. " St. Clare, 
you really are inconsiderate ! So nervous as I am, the least 
breath disturbs me ; and a strange hand about me would 
drive me absolutely frantic. If Mammy felt the interest in 
me she ought to, she'd wake easier of course she would. 
I've heard of people who had such devoted servants,, but it 
never was my luck ; " and Marie sighed. 

Miss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air 
of shrewd, observant gravity ; and she still kept her lips 
tightly compressed, as if. determined fully to ascertain her 
longitude and position, before she committed herself. 

" Now, Mammy has a sort of goodness," said Marie ; 
"she's smooth and respectful, but she's selfish at heart. 
Now, she never will be done fidgeting and worrying about 
that husband of hers. You see, when 1 was married and 
came to live here, of course I had to bring her with me, and 
her husband, my father couldn't spare. He was a black- 
smith, and, of course, very necessary ; and I thought and 





said, at the time, that Mammy and he had better give each 
other up, as it wasn't likely to be convenient for them ever 
to live together again. I wish now I'd insisted on it, and 
married Mammy to somebody else ; but I was foolish and 
indulgent, and didn't want to insist. I told Mammy at the 
time that she musn't ever expect to see him more than once 
or twice in her life again, for the air of father's place doesn't 
agree with my health, and I can't go there ; and I advised 
her to take up with somebody else ; but no she wouldn't. 
Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her, in spots, that 
everybody don't see as I do." 

" Has she children ? " said Miss Ophelia. 

" Yes ; she has two." 

" I suppose she feels the separation from them ?" 

" "Well, of course, I couldn't bring them. They were 
little dirty things I couldn't have them about ; and, besides, 
they took up too much of her time ; but I believe that 
Mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this. 
She won't marry anybody else ; and I do believe now, though 
she knows how necessary she is to me, and how feeble my 
health is, she would go back to her husband to-morrow, if 
she only could. I do, indeed," said Marie ; " they are just so 
selfish, now, the best of them." 

" It's distressing to reflect upon," said St. Clare, dryly. 

Miss Ophelia looked keenly at him, and saw the flush of 
mortification and repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl 
of the lip, as he spoke. 

"Now, Mammy has always been a pet with me," said 
Marie. " I wish some of your northern servants could look 
at her closets of dresses, silks and muslins, and one real 
linen cambric, she has hanging there. I've worked sometimes whole afternoons, trimming her caps, and getting her 
ready to .go to a party. As to abuse, she don't know what 
it is. She never was whipped more than once or twice in her 
whole life. She has her strong coffee or her tea every day, 
with white sugar in it. It's abominable, to be sure; but 
St. Clare will have high life below stairs, and they, every 
one of them, live just as they please. The fact is, our 
servants are over indulged. I suppose it is partly our fault 
that they are selfish, and act like spoiled children ; but I've 
talked to St. Clare till I am tired." 





" And I, too," said St. Clare, taking up the morning paper. 

Eva, the beautiful Eva, had stood listening to her mother, 
with that expression of deep and mystic earnestness which 
was peculiar to her. She walked softly round to her mother's 
chair, and put her arms round her neck. ; ; 

" Well, Eva, what now ? " said Marie. 

" Mamma, couldn't I take care of you one night just 
one ? I know I shouldn't make you nervous, and I shouldn't 
sleep. I often lie awake nights thinking " 

" Oh, nonsense, child nonsense ! " said Marie ; you are 
such a strange child !" 

" But may I, mamma ? I think," she said timidly, " that 
Mammy isn't well. She told me her head ached all the 
time lately." 

" Oh, that's just one of Mammy's fidgets ! Mammy is 
just like all the rest of them makes such a fuss about 
every little head-ache or finger-ache ; it'll never do to encourage it never ! I'm principled about this matter," said 
she, turning to Miss Ophelia ; " you'll find the necessity of it. 
If you encourage servants in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, 
you'll have your hands full. I never complain myself 
nobody knows what I endure. I feel it a duty to bear it !! 
quietly, and I do." 

Miss Ophelia's round eyes expressed an undisguised 
amazement at this peroration, which struck St. Clare as so 
supremely ludicrous that he burst into a loud laugh. 

" St. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion 
to my ill-health," said Marie, with the voice of a suffering 
martyr. " I only hope the day won't come when he'll 
remember it ! " and Marie put her handkerchief to her eyes. 

Of course there was rather a foolish silence. Pinally, St. 
Clare got up, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. Eva tripped away after him, and Miss 
Ophelia and Marie remained at the table alone. 

" Now, that's just like St. Clare ! " said the latter, with- 
drawing her handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited 
flourish, when the criminal to be affected by it was no 
longer in sight. 

" He never realises, never can, never will, what I suffer, 
and have for years. If I was one of the complaining 





sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would 
be some reason for it. Men do get tired, naturally, of a 
complaining wife. But I've kept things to myself, and 
borne, and borne, till St. Clare has got in the way of 
thinking I can bear anything." 

Miss Ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected 
to answer to this. 

While she was thinking what to say, Marie gradually 
wiped away her tears, and smoothed her plumage in a 
general sort of way, as a dove might be supposed to make 
toilet after a shower, and began a housewifely chat with 
Miss Ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets, linen-presses, 
store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by 
common understanding, to assume the direction giving her 
so many cautions, directions, and charges, that a head less 
systematic and business-like than Miss Ophelia's would have 
been utterly dizzied and confounded. 

" And now," said Marie, " I believe I've told you everything ; so that, \vhen my next sick turn comes on, you'll be 
able to go forward entirely, without consulting me ; only 
about Eva she requires watching." 

" She seems to be a good child, very," said Miss Ophelia ; 
" I never saw a better child." 

"Eva's peculiar," said her mother, "very. There are 
things about her so singular: she isn't like me, now, a 
particle: " and Marie sighed, as if this was a truly melancholy 
consideration. 

Miss Ophelia in her own heart said, " I hope she isn't," 
but had prudence enough to keep it down. 

" Eva always was disposed to be with servants ; and I 
think that well enough with some -children. Now, I always 
played with father's little negroes it never did me any 
harm. But Eva somehow always seems to put herself on an 
equality with every creature that comes near her. It's a 
strange thing about the child. I never have been able to 
break her of it. St. Clare, I believe, encourages her in it. 
The fact is, St. Clare indulges every creature under this roof 
but his own wife." 

Again Miss Ophelia sat in blank silence. 

" Now, there's no way with servants," said Marie, "but 
to put them down, and keep them down. It was always 





natural to me, from a child. Eva is enough to spoil a whole 
house-full. YVhat she will do when she comes to keep house 
herself, I'm sure I don't know. I hold to being kind to 
servants I always am; but you must make 'em know 
their place. Eva never does ; there's no getting into the 
child's head the first beginning of an idea what a servant's 
place is ! You heard her offering to take care of me nights, 
to let Mammy sleep ! That's just a specimen of the way 
the child would be doing all the time, if she was left to 
herself." 

" Why," said Miss Ophelia bluntly, " I suppose you think 
your servants are human creatures, and ought to have some 
rest when they are tired ?" 

" Certainly, of course. I'm very particular in letting them 
have every thing that comes convenient anything that 
doesn't put one at all out of the way, you know. Mammy 
can make up her sleep, some time or other ; there's no difficulty about that. She's the sleepiest concern that ever I 
saw ; sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to 
sleep, and sleep anywhere and everywhere. No danger but 
Mammy gets sleep enough. But this treating servants as if 
they were exotic flowers or china vases is really ridiculous," 
said Marie, as she plunged languidly into the depths of a 
voluminous and pillowy lounge, and drew towards her an 
elegant cut-glass vinaigrette. 

"You see," she continued, in a faint and lady-like voice, 
like the last dying breath of an Arabian jessamine, or something equally ethereal, " you see, Cousin Ophelia, I don't 
often speak of myself. It isn't my habit ; 'tisn't agreeable 
to me. In fact, I haven't strength to it. But there are 
points where St. Clare and I differ. St. Clare never understood me, never appreciated me. I think it lies at the root 
of all my ill-health. St. Clare means well, I am bound to 
believe ; but men are constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate 
to woman. That, at least, is my impression." 

Miss Ophelia, who had not a small share of the genuine 
New England caution, and a very particular horror of being 
drawn into family difficulties, now began to foresee something of this kind impending : so, composing her face into a 
grim neutrality, and drawing out of her pocket about a yard 
and a quarter of stocking, which she kept as a specific against 





what Dr. Watts asserts to be a personal habit of Satan 
when people have idle hands, she proceeded to knit most 
energetically, shutting her lips together in a way that said, as 
plain as words could, " You needn't try to make me speak. 
I don't want anything to do with your affairs" in fact, 
she looked about as sympathising as a stone lion. But 
Marie didn't care for that. She had got somebody to talk 
to, and she felt it her duty to talk, and that was enough ; and 
reinforcing herself by smelling again at her vinaigrette, she 
went on. 

" You see, I brought my own property and servants into 
the connection when I married St. Clare, and I am legally 
entitled to manage them my own way. St. Clare had his fortune and his servants, and I'm well enough content he should 
manage them his way ; but St. Clare will be interfering. He 
has wild extravagant notions about things, particularly about 
the treatment of servants. He really does act as if he set 
his servants before me, and before himself, too ; for he lets 
them make him all sorts of trouble, and never lifts a finger. 
Now, about some things, St. Clare is really frightful he 
frightens me good-natured as he looks, in general. Now, 
he has set down his foot that, come what will, there shall not 
be a blow struck in this house, except what he or I strike ; 
and he does it in a way that I really dare not cross him. 
"Well, you may see what that leads to ; for St. Clare wouldn't 
raise his hand, if every one of them walked over him, and I 
you see how cruel it would be to require me to make the 
exertion. Now, you know these servants are nothing but 
grown-up children." 

" I don't know anything about it, and I thank the Lord 
that I don't ! " said Miss Ophelia, shortly. 

" "Well, but you will have to know something, and know 
it to your cost, if you stay here. You don't know what a 
provoking, stupid, careless, unreasonable, childish, ungrateful 
set of wretches they are." 

Marie seemed wonderfully supported, always, when she 
got upon this topic; and she now opened her eyes, and 
seemed quite to forget her languor. 

" You don't know, and you can't, the daily, hourly trials 
that beset a housekeeper from them, every where and every 
way. But it's no use to complain to St. Clare. He talks 





the strangest stuff. He says we have made them what they 
are, and ought to bear with them. He says their faults are 
all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the fault 
and punish it too. He says we shouldn't do any better, in 
their place ; just as if one could reason from them to us, 
you know." 

" Don't you believe that the Lord made them of one blood 
with us ? " said Miss Ophelia, shortly. 

" No, indeed, not I ! A pretty story, truly ! They are a 
degraded race." 

" Don't you think they've got immortal souls ? " said Miss 
Ophelia, with increasing indignation. 

" Oh, well," said Marie, yawning, " that, of course 
nobody doubts that. But as to putting them on any sort of 
equality with us, you know, as if we could be compared, 
why, it's impossible ! Now, St. Clare really has talked to 
me as if keeping Mammy from her husband was like keeping 
me from mine. There's no comparing in this way. Mammy 
couldn't have the feelings that I should. It's a different 
thing altogether of course, it is ; and yet St. Clare pretends 
not to see it. And just as if Mammy could love her little 
dirty babies as I love Eva ! Yet St. Clare once really and 
soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty, with my 
weak health, and all I suffer, to let Mammy go back, and 
take somebody else in her place. That was a little too 
much even for me to bear. I don't often show my feelings. 
I make it a principle to endure everything in silence ; it's 
a wife's hard lot, and I bear it. But I did break out, that 
time ; so that he has never alluded to the subject since. 
But I know by his looks, and little things that he says, that 
he thinks so as much as ever; and it's so trying, so 
provoking ! " 

Miss Ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she 
should say something; but she rattled away with her 
needles in a way that had volumes of meaning in it, if 
Marie could only have understood it. 

" So, you just see," she continued, " what you've got to 
manage. A household without any rule ; where servants 
have it all their own way, do what they please, and have 
what they please, except so far as I, with my feeble health, 
have kept up government. I keep my cowhide about, and 





sometimes I do lay it on ; but the exertion is always too 
much for me. If St. Clare would only have this thing done 
as others do " 

"And how's that?" 

" Why, send them to the calaboose, or some of the other 
places, to be flogged. That's the only way. If I wasn't 
such a poor, feeble piece, I believe I should manage with 
twice the energy that St. Clare does." 

" And how does St. Clare contrive to manage ? " said Miss 
Ophelia. " You say he never strikes a blow." 

" Well, men have a more commanding way, you know ; 
it is easier for them : besides, if you ever looked full in his 
eye, it's peculiar that eye and if he speaks decidedly, 
there's a kind of flash. I'm afraid of it, myself; and the 
servants know they must mind. I couldn't do as much by 
a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn 
of his eye, if once he is in earnest. Oh, there's no trouble 
about St. Clare ; that's the reason he has no more feeling 
for me. But you'll find, when you come to manage, that 
there's no getting along without severity they are so bad, 
so deceitful, so lazy." 

"The old tune," said St. Clare, sauntering in. "What 
an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle, 
at last, especially for being lazy! You see, cousin," said he, 
as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to 
Marie, " it's wholly inexcusable in them, in the light of the 
example that Marie and I set them, this laziness." 

" Come, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!" said Marie. 

" Am I, now ? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite 
remarkably for me. I try to enforce your remarks, Marie, 
always." 

"You know you meant no such thing, St. Clare," said 
Marie. 

" Oh, I must have been mistaken, then. Thank you, my 
dear, for setting me right." 

" You do really try to be provoking," said Marie. 

" Oh, come, Marie, the day is growing warm, and I have 
just had a long quarrel with Dolph, which has fatigued me 
excessively ; so, pray be agreeable now, and let a fellow 
repose in the light of your smile." 

" What's the matter about Dolph ? " said Marie. " That 





fellow's impudence has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me. I only wish I had the undisputed 
management of him a while. I'd bring him down." 

" What you say, my dear, is marked with your usual 
acuteness and good sense," said St. Clare. " As to Dolph, 
the case is this : that he has so long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections, that he has at last really 
mistaken himself for his master ; and I have been obliged to 
give him a little insight into his mistake." 

" How ? " said Marie. 

" Why, I was obliged to let him understand explicitly that 
I preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal 
wearing ; also, I put his magnificence upon an allowance of 
Cologne water, and actually was so cruel as to restrict him 
to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs. Dolph was 
particularly huffy about it, and I had to talk to him like a 
father to bring him round." 

" Oh ! St. Clare, when will you learn how to treat your 
servants ? It's abominable, the way you indulge them ! " 
said Marie. 

" Why, after all, what's the harm of the poor dog's wanting 
to be like his master ? and if I haven't brought him up any 
better than to find his chief good in Cologne and cambric 
handkerchiefs, why shouldn't I give them to him ? " 

"And why havn't you brought him up better?" said 
Miss Ophelia, with blunt determination. 

" Too much trouble ; laziness, cousin, laziness which 
ruins more souls than you can shake a stick at. If it weren't 
for laziness, I should have been a perfect angel, myself. I'm
