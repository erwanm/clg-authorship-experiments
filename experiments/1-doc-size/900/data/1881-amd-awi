" Yes ; I am all curiosity to see you, though I haye my 
own hands full of family matters. Oddly enough, I hear 
you are mixed up with that Ormiston imbroglio, and that 
you are guardian to the girl. Is everything swept away? 
I thought Mark Ormiston too shrewd to trust a villain." 

"Perhaps he did not trust a villain. Ten years of 
business experience under his very eye ought to count for 
something. I have a theory that opportunity brings out 
latent virtues and vices, and that it is seldom wise to count 
implicitly on a man's honesty unless he is an exceptional 
man. But we are not blameless. I should have taken 
my dear father's place before. Indeed, I feel quite 
conscience smitten, and must do my best to remedy what I 
can." 

" Then it is true that you are going to bury yourself 
alive in that dismal place ; you, with all your education, 
accomplishments, genius, one might say, refinement and 
everything, in the manufacturing of paper." 

" Not quite that," with a smile. " I am afraid I would 
sooner have paid over half my fortune. I have found a 
capable and efficient person to take charge, a very dear 
friend of my early boyhood. And if you can settle upon 
some way to dispose of Miss Ormiston for the next three 
years—" 



 



 



 

" Ib she not in school ? " 

St. George explained the unlucky contretemps, without 
the particulars of their interview. 

'' Is she like her father? But I forget you know nothing 
about him. Shall I confess a rebuff in my otherwise 
satisfactory life? I once actually offered to befriend 
this girl, if necessary, when her father was lying at death's 
door." 

"You ! '' in surprise. 

" Oh ! perhaps you are not aware that Mark Ormiston 
was a connection of my father's ; indeed, was at one time 
a member of our family ; but when he took to money 
making, he quite dropped us. Yet I always felt a great 
sympathy with him in the accident that deprived him of 
health and strength in the very prime of manhood. I 
actually overlooked neglect and went to him ; but I might 
better have stayed away. He was morose, suspicious, self- 
contained, and almost uncivil. His plans had been made 
for his daughter. Would she have been so very rich ? " 

" There was a large fortune in the different invest- 
ments ; but some must be given up as not worth the outlay 
necessary to save them. Let us go in here and talk over 
our luncheon." 

They sat a long while at the daintily spread table. 
Mrs. Allaire had known St. George from boyhood, and 
loved him with the coveting love of a mother. Her own 
graceful, nonchalant son, with his airy indifference, stung 
her by contrast, for she was a woman proud of mother- 
hood. She had allowed herself a little dream of a pos- 
sible tie; but he had gone away just as her beautiful 
Helen was budding into womanhood. For a moment 
I am afraid she cordially hated Brower Stannard ; but it 
was too late, with a wedding day appointed. There was 
Lucia, but Helen would have been his royal counterpart 
Oh, why could she not have waited ! 

Mrs. Allaire listened to his ultra-conscientiousness that 



 



 





he settled in this way for her : " K it had been a child of 
yonrs who had met with bo great a loss through my neg- 
lect," and she felt that she would like him to act nobly 
right to any child of hers. But as she listened, a curious 
feeling sprang up in regard to Christmas Ormiston, — a 
kind of jealousy lest she should enter too closely into St. 
George's life, and it was this, rather than sympathy, that 
swayed her. 

" She might come to us for a while,'' said Mrs. Allaire, 
with just the right mixture of interest and indifference. 
" It seems the proper thing, since we are about the only 
relatives she has. Then Dolly has a most excellent gov- 
erness, but Lucia is emancipated from the school-room. 
Helen will be married at Christmas " ; and the mother 
sighed. " She was such a favorite of yours," — and St. 
George's eyes softened with pleasure, — "I could wish she 
had chosen differently ; but Mr. Stannard is very estimable, 
and Helen's strong point is family. The Stannards are 
unexceptionable there. You must see her married ; in- 
deed, you must come to us. It will not be like going into 
society." 

" I should have come to you immediately but for this 
perplexing business. There was so much to say about 
him." And Leighton's eyes softened almost to tears. 

When they parted it was with the understanding that 
St. George was to bring his ward to Meadowcroft. 




Chbistuis OmnsToy had gone through her tempest of 
passion and settled into apathy, assisted by the plain, 
strong sense of Mrs. Norcross. She made no objection 
to Meadowcroft ; indeed, her quiet, stony air seemed a 
puzzle to Leighton St. Gkorge. Several notes passed be- 
tween him and Mrs. Allaire, and the day for the journey 
was appointed ; but Ellen Norcross was called away sud- 
denly, and St. George sent a note explaining, and herald- 
ing his ward ; and the latter reached Meadowcroft first, 
blundering on a most unfortunate hospitality. Mrs. Al- 
laire was generous in many things, but quick to exact 
her due, and not eren St. George, favorite that he was, 
could trespass unrebuked; it was poor Christmas who 
suffered the most for his misadventure. 

Sitting here gazing into the flickering firelight, she real- 
izes that in some strange way disappointment is to be her 
lot. She has given a young girl's unreasoning admiration 
to Mrs. Treverton, to find herself presently pushed aside, 
treated with careless neglect. She has hoped, too, for 
something from these unknown relatives ; but the dream 
has been cruelly shattered. She says to herself, with the 
sweeping despair of youth, that there is no such thing as 
love. Perhaps it was a similar experience that moulded 
her father into the cold, suspicious man she remembers 
him. She does not even know whether he loved her 
mother, and somehow, her idea of her mother is truer than 
she would like to believe. So she must put on her armor 
and gird up her soul. Her lot is not to be like that of 



 



 





otiier women. Some day she will liye at Glen Ormiston 
alone ; she will be head of the basinesB. She cannot under- 
stand why she could not enter the mill as a boy does and 
work her way up ; she can keep books and accounts ; she 
knows many useful points ; but no ; she is thrust off here 
where no one wants her— 

The door opens again. 

" Come," says Dolly, " they are not quite ready for 
me, and mamma said I might show you the rooms. What 
a pity you cannot come down ; but you have no dress, of 
course, and you do not know any one ; but you need not 
keep your door shut, and you can hear and see a little.'' 

Before Miss Ormiston is aware, Dolly has hurried her 
out in the hall and is leading her down-stairs. She catches 
her breath. Wafts of fragrance float on the air. The 
lights are low, but it gives the glamour of fairy-land. Car- 
pets that are a dream of luxury, curtains sweeping the 
floor, pictures, marbles, cosy-chairs, easels with sketches 
or paintings, absolutely winning you to inspection; a 
blending of colors and adornment so entirely harmonious, 
that it does not bewilder, but charms, as if one had wan- 
dered into an enchanted country. The girl drew a long 
breath of rapture that was like a sob. Mrs. Treverton 
had indulged in showy magnificence, but this was so above 
and beyond, that a sudden new sense flashes over Christ- 
mas. 

" Well, haven't you even a word?" asked DoUy, disap- 
pointedly. 

"No," Christmas replies in a strained, husky tone. 
" There is nothing for one to say." 

<* Well, I think there is a great deal," insists DoUy. 
" You could at least admit that it is beautiful." 

" Beautiful is no word, or a weak one ; it is perfect ! 
One dreams of such things ! And oh, the flowers I " 

" Helen would not have the conservatory despoiled, and 
die spent a small fortune in flowers. It is really her last 



 



 



 

appearance, yon know, although it is given in Lucia's 
name. And if you could only see her when she is dressed I 
Her gown is cream satin, brocaded with velvet flowers, 
one of her wedding dresses ; and Lu's is white silk, and 
mine silk and cashmere, with no end of palest pink ribbons. 
I 'll come and show you when I am dressed." 

Dolly went on chatting as she took Christmas through 
the two parlors, the sitting-room and library, that had 
been transformed into bowers of beauty. At the end of 
the hall the conservatory, that looked like some weird, 
tempting entrance into an unknown land. There was not 
so much bloom, but the feathery ferns, the trailing vines, 
the foliage plants, interspersed, gave it a richness. An 
enormous scarlet cactus in one comer was like a vestal 
flame. Christmas longed to bury her face in the green 
masses and for a moment lose consciousness. Dolly 
could not understand such an impulse. 

" It is magnificent ! " she says with a great tremble iq 
her voice. 

" Of course, Mrs. Treverton gave grand parties, — on 
your money," appends Dolly. 

" But nothing like this. You would think Glen Ormis* 
ton dreary," she admits candidly. 

"I do suppose I should," is Dolly's frank rejoinder 
" Ruins are well enough when one goes abroad." 

" But it is not a ruin, and it could be made grand." 

" Dolly I " calls a warning voice. 

" There ! my turn has come. Let us run back." 

There is another stir. Christmas has not quite closed 
the door, and she soon hears that it is the musicians. 
The tuning begins, — horrible shrieks of discord, with now 
and then a wandering strain of melody. There is a 
rustling up and down ; guests begin to come ; laughs and 
gay voices are frequent. Dolly flies in again looking like 
a princess in her pretty attire, and flowing hair that glit- 
ters as if gold sprinkled. No one else comes, but Christ- 



 



 





mas listens and glances out at the visions. Then the 
bewildering music throbs on the air, and Christmas clasps 
her hands together. Ah ! it is well she is not going to be 
in the midst of it ; her heart would surely break with rap- 
ture. She is so moved out of her usual repressed self, 
that she cannot understand it. A few hours ago she was 
icily wretched ; now her pulses throb as if this joy was 
really hers, as if she was part and parcel of the festivity. 
A latent something rouses her to a new life. She glances 
backward at Mrs. Treverton's florid pleasures with dis- 
gust. The air has the fine sparkle of champagne upon it, 
and it seems to touch her on every side like an electrio 
current. 

Presently the dancing begins. Ah, if she could see it ! 
She listens awhile at the door ; no one is going up or 
down, so she steals out. A great palm has been brought 
up here, and she creeps around it, leaning over the balus- 
ter. They are waltzing in the hall below ; floating, it 
seems to her, to the ravishing music. She forgets all 
until a soft, gay voice says in her very ear, " Hillo ! " and 
she starts like a culprit ; but her escape is cut off by a 
young man, whose likeness to Dolly proclaims him of tiie 
household. 

'' Miss Ormiston, is it not? I am Ward Allaire. Let 
us stretch our cousinship to the full measure. You have 
been kept in durance all day, and I have been at every 
one's beck and call, so there has been no time for friendly 
proprieties. It is a shame you cannot be down among us 
having some fun." 

" I ! " Christmas stammers, and blushes guiltily. 

"Do you love dancing? A girl of your litheness 
ought. See, it is just this ; and before she is aware he 
has whirled her out to the open space and taken several 
turns.'' 

"Oh!'' she cries, just under her breath, "let me go, 

 



 

"I ought to beg your pardon ; but jon tempted me. 
Enid or Eve." And he shows his white teeth as he laoghs. 
"I have been doing my duty manfully, I assure you, 
quadrilling with the unattractiye girls and waltzing with 
Dolly. I came up to have the solace of a cigar, when I 
reflected that the scent would get into my hair and my 
clothes. We pay a heavy price for superior civilization, 
you see. How odd that you should have dropped from 
the clouds just at this timel I wonder how you will 
likens?" 

Christmas blushes vividly. "I must go back," she 
says in a half -frightened tone. 

" Let me send you up an ice or something.'' Yet he does 
not stir to let her pass, and she cannot move the palm. 
'' No, no, you must go down." How handsome he looks, 
standing tiiere with a kind of daring in every feature. 
She cannot help but smile, and it transfigures her. No 
one has ever seen her look like that ; nothing has ever 
called out such a smile. " You must like me," he says 
winningly. "But I dare say you have taken up St. 
Greorge. He is the kind women rave over. He has 
been plucky to stand by you, and women always admire 
that immensely." 

"To stand by me? " in a doubtful, incredulous tone. 

" Well, you know he might have thrown up the whole 
thing, instead of qualifying for the trust. Its an awful 
bad mess, I have heard ; but he had heroic views of duty 
to his father's memory and all that I I hope he can save 
something for you. What a tremendous swindler that 
Treverton turned out to be. I should want him arrested." 

"Do you think Mr. St. George had no duty to my 
father?" she asks sharply. "If he accepted a trust, was 
he not bound to exercise some supervision?" 

"But he was ill, you know. And everybody thinks 
Leighton the most admirable of men. He has every 
accomplishment imder the sun, and an immense fortune, 



 



 





and people wonder at his burying himself in that ont-of - 
the-way place for a sort of fanciful theory — " 

" Do you call right or duty a fanciful theory?" 

The music ceases, and the hum of conversation begins. 
There is a diversion in the hall below, and Ward Allaire 
stands aside for Miss Ormiston to pass. As she disap- 
pears he smiles and half says to himself, " An extremely 
piquant and deadly upright person. One might get 
quite a sensation of freshness out of her.' 

The maid comes in to spread up the sofa bed which 
she is to share with DoUy. She kindly asks if Miss 
Ormiston will have anything ; but Christmas replies in the 
negative. Then she closes the door, though she is glad 
not to shut out the sound, and feeling weary from excite- 
ment and her last nighf s broken slumbers, she throws 
herself down on the bed, and in ten minutes is in the 
unromantic but refreshing sleep of youth. 

Long past midnight Dolly rouses her. At first she can- 
not think where she is, and shivers with a sensation of 
being back at school. Dolly chatters, she has had such a 
glorious time. There is only one more year of govemess- 
ing, and no doubt Lu will be married. Lu has no such grand 
ideas as Helen, and means to look out for money. " Oh, 
wouldn't it be magnificent if she could catch St. George, 
since Helen must be counted out. And I'll have a clear 
deck and no end of fun ! " 

The last sound Christmas hears is her gay, chattering 
voice, you can hardly call it conversation. But it is morning 
before the last get to bed, and from nine to twelve there 
are relays of breakfast and guests departing. Christmas 
is formally invited down to luncheon. Her trunk has 
come and Dolly superintends her dressing, — choosing a 
soft olive cashmere only to find it dreadfully unbecoming. 
"But you have nothing else beside grays and browns," 
cries the girl in dismay. "Mrs. Treverton was not very 
lavish on y(mr wardrobe." 



 



 



 

Mrs. Allaire is gracious, and she is introduced to the 
family circle, but shrinks visibly into herself. Every one 
is too much engrossed to notice her ; even Ward is keep- 
ing up a rather brilliant flirtation with Miss Palmer. 
Through the afternoon the guests thin out still more, and 
on the succeeding day the Stannards and all the Allaires, 
save Dolly, go to the city. But Christmas has been given 
a pleasant room and learns that Miss Clement, the govern- 
ess, went home because her sister was ailing, and will not 
return until January. There is enough to entertain her. 
She explores the house, studies the pictures, dreams in 
the conservatory, and finds the library an inexhaustible 
treasure. Altogether she is very well satisfied. She has 
no unreasonable expectations of love ; indeed, these people 
are so different from the world in which she has lived 
that she wants to go slowly with them. Dolly is so vola- 
tile and inconsequent that Christmas is really tried with 
her, only she does lose herself for hours in a novel when 
there is peace and rest. 

Mrs. Allaire has dropped a little note to Mr. St. Greorge 
to say she desu*es to see him in the city. She has taken 
a suite of rooms at a hotel for convenience, as a country 
house would be rather awkward for a city wedding. 
Helen and her mother are very busy, though the bride 
elect does not go out. Lucia is delighted with errands 
and calls. The real work of the trousseau has ended, 
and there are only little things to buy and gifts to receive. 
Plans have been made. After a proper tour tiiey will 
spend two or three months in Washington, then return 
and go to housekeeping. Helen has a considerable for- 
tune, and Brower Stannard acquiesces in all her arrange- 
ments. 

Leighton St. Greorge has not seen her since she was a 
tall, slim, dignified girl. Her great characteristic, perhaps, 
was that elegant dignity. Now she is a very handsome 
woman, quiet, statuesque, reposeful, harmonious. He 



 



 





has always admired her, and he gives her the same admi- 
ration now ; but he wonders in his secret heart why she 
chose Mr. Stannard. He has some old-fashioned notions 
about love, though he has never tried it. He and his 
father have sufficed for the intimate companionship of 
life, and he does not speculate upon any woman, even 
Helen, with this sore grief at his heart. But he has a 
son's gratitude toward Mrs. Allaire for helping him in this 
awkward dilemma. Being trustee of an almost bankrupt 
estate can be borne with undaunted courage; but the 
guardianship of a young girl — of Christmas Ormiston 
— he finds intensely disagreeable. 

" I am used to girls, and I should have to keep Miss 
Clement another year for Dolly," explains Mrs.' Allaire. 
''It is most fitting that I should have charge of her. 
Then I shall introduce her into society" ; and she smiles 
with a sort of motherly content. " But must you live at 
Glen Ormiston, — bury yourself alive in such an out-of- 
the-world place ? " 

''It is better for the present. Donaldson needs me, 
and the matter requires the utmost attention as well as 
prudence. But I shall keep my roomc in the city. I 
have no mind to turn recluse. Then there is still a part 
of my father's estate to settle." 

" Leighton," her voice drops to that subtile, advisory 
cadence, " is it true that you used your private fortune in 
this wretched Ormiston business?" 

" It is true. I could not endure a breath of neglect to 
rest upon my father's memory. When I saw how his 
health disinclined him to perform his share of the duty, I 
should have taken it in hand. There was no check upon 
Treverton. His statements to us were the most absolute 
falsehoods. I blame myself for not suspecting. Yes, at 
any cost, I must redeem my trust." 

Ah, if she had a son like this I Her mother's heart was 
pierced by a secret pang. The manly integrity filled her 



 



 



 

with admiration, and yet she half hated that this nobleness 
should be laid at the feet of Christmas Ormiston. 

He wrote a brief note to his ward, expressing his regret 
that her journey should have prored so uncomfortable, 
and hoping that her pleasant home at the Allaires' would 
compensate for the trials of the past months. She might 
rest in the assurance that he would use his most faithful 
endeavors to restore the prosperity endangered by his neg- 
lect. 

On Christmas eve, at six o'clock. Miss Helen Allaire is 
married with all pomp and elegance, the bishop perform- 
ing the ceremony. The church is in its glad array of 
greenery and flowers, the music is perfect, the bridal cdr- 
tege imposing. That the church is crowded goes without 
saying, though it is a strict invitation wedding. The 
bride receives calls for the next two hours, and then takes 
the train to her new world, while the festivities still go on, 
Lucia being quite a little queen and Dolly enchanting. 
Even St. George has come in quietly and been welcomed 
so cordially by old friends that he could almost fancy his 
sorrow a dream. Mrs. Allaire remarks that he talks to 
Lucia considerably, and her secret heart rejoices. 

For several days they are full of midwinter gayety, then 
they return home. Ward is in the great law firm of Sea- 
bury Sd Crawford, who were friends of his father's. He 
is a very dilettante young man, with an income that suf- 
fices for a great part of his wants ; for the rest, he improv- 
idently draws upon his capital. He is up in the polite 
criticisms of the day, — art, music, literature ; occasion- 
ally he writes an article in a very superior vein. He gives 
elegant suppers, he goes into the best society, he is the 
pet of admiring mammas and sighing daughters. Some 
day he will marry a rich man's heiress, and by middle life 
get pushed to the front, somewhere. But, like Dolly, he 
is only intent upon the good time now. 

Christmas Ormiston grows to feel more at home in their 



 



 





absence than she would have in weeks of contact with 
these Allaires. They are not of her kind. Society, gay- 
ety, marriage, are not the great points to her life. She 
is, some way, to be a son to her father's memory, to make 
Glen Ormiston what he would like. Mrs. Treverton's 
reign has not implanted a love of pleasure in her soul, nor 
eradicated the curious sense of having her destiny marked 
out for her, — a destiny that is not the ordinary one of 
womenMnd. 

Mrs. Allaire and DoUy return on the last day of the old 
year. Lucia has still a round of visits on her list. Miss 
Clement reaches them on Saturday, and Christmas finds 
her not at all formidable. A fair, rather careworn woman 
of middle age, near sighted, and with a peculiar, careful 
step and motion, a low, pleasant voice with a slightly for- 
mal pronunciation, and an almost Quaker-like neatness in 
dress. She converses in French nearly altogether, Mrs. 
Allaire keeping up her girlhood's accomplishment for the 
sake of perfecting her daughters. 

Miss Clement finds her new pupil a great contrast to 
heedless, laughing Dolly. She is a little startled by 
her unusual attainments in some branches, and her notable 
deficiencies in others ; by her curious selection of books in 
reading, and her fearless discussions of what seems quite 
out of the domain of modem young-ladyhood. 

" One would think you were in training for a business 
woman," Miss Clement says one day, ratiier offended at 
her utterly practical manner. 

Christmas glances steadily at the fiowers in the carpet. 
Fine, delicate Miss Clement would be shocked at her 
plans. 



 



 



CHAFTEB IV. 

JL DUTT HEBBLT* 

It is early smnmer at Glen Onniston, the loveliest part 
of the whole year, if not the grandest. The old house 
stands on an elevation that slopes gently down to the 
road, leaving a spacious lawn between, with a winding 
gravelled drive and clumps of trees so placed as not to 
shut out the view. Camlsy lies in a sort of valley ; but 
looking over the town cne can see a succession of bold 
picturesque hills dotted here and there by farm-houses. 

There is a wide porch with French windows opening on it, 
one of the improvements of the Trevertons. Mrs. Donald- 
son is sitting in a roomy invalid chair, quite from force of 
habit, and St. George reclines indolently in a hammock, 
turning the leaves of a new art magazine. 

" How beautiful it aU is ! " Mrs. Donaldson says, in a. 
half -musing tone as her eye rests on the landscape. She 
is still exceedingly fragile, but there is every indication of 
returning health. Since the spring opened she had im- 
proved rapidly. 

" Yes," St. George replies. " And yet I was not im- 
pressed with it last autumn. I have been wondering at 
my blindness. Not a day, but I see marvellous points 
that tempt me to while away hours, and my friends 
upbraid me with my close confinement to business." 

He laughs lightly at this. 

''But you and Philip have confined yourselves day and 
night. I am glad to see you able to indulge in a few hours 
of luxurious idling. And you are really seeing your way 
«lear ahead." 

" Thanks to Philip, I never could have pulled through 



 



 



alone. My meeting him was the most fortonate thing in 
it all. Yes, we can retrieve some of the misfortunes if all 
goes well." 

" What is Miss Ormiston like?" Mrs. Donaldson asks 
quietly. 

St. George stares into vacancy. 

" I have been wondering if she did not consider herself 
coolly dispossessed when we came here." 

"Why, she could not have lived in this great house 
alone, and there was no money for servants or anything." 

" You think she is happy with her relatives? Does she 
fceem content?" 

"My dear Mrs. Donaldson, I am afraid Providence 
never intended me for a guardian. First, by neglect I 
Imperil my ward's fortune ; then, I am ashamed to say, not 
knowing how to get on with her, and having no special 
curiosity, I have not seen her since I put her in the train 
at Camley. Her cousin, Mrs. Allaire, I have met in the 
city; and at my one brief visit to Meadowcroft, Miss 
Ormiston was indisposed." 

" She ought to be very grateful to you." 

St. George makes a curious little gesture. " Isn't that 
a feminine way of looking at it?" he questions ; " a sort 
of romantic admiration instead of even-handed justice? 
Since Miss Ormiston's affairs came to grief through my 
neglect, it was clearly my duty to set them straight, if I 
could. It would have been dishonest, otherwise." 

" And you are thoroughly honest. I think simple integ- 
rity the crowning virtue of manhood. It would kill me to 
have Philip do some of the things that pass current in the 
world for shrewdness and ability. But we wander from 
Miss Ormiston. I was studying her portrait this morning. 
It is that of such a sad child, and I think her life has been 
far from happy. I was so ill last faU, you know, that I 
had no interest in a stranger. But if you approved, I 
should like to ask her here." 



 



 



 

St. George falls into a revery. " I am afraid yon will 
not like her," he says, at length. 

"Why?" 

" I cannot give you a good reason" ; and he smiles a 
little. "It is simply one of those fugitive impressions. 
I saw very little of her, it is true, and my duty is to culti- 
vate her, is it not? Well, suppose we, that is you, invite 
her here?" 

" Would you like it? " a little timidly. 

" What objection could I have? If I did not like her 
I could go away, you know. I hope there is no deadly feud 
between us. And I reaUy must go to Meadowcroft. I 
have been specially invited for the 20th, to meet Mrs. 
Stannard, and will take your message with pleasure." 

St. Greorge flushes a little, feeling that he has not told 
the exact truth. To please Mrs. Donaldson would be a 
delight to him ; but to have Miss Ormiston here — has he 
come to that, grudging her her own home ? 

He has kept a room here and somehow it has grown 
dear to him. Night after night he and Donaldson have 
spent hours in the library studying, planning, considering 
best and safest methods, enlargements, retrenchments. 
Business has not been quite the distasteful thing he 
fancied, or is it his friend's perseverance that inspires 
him? Of late there has been a little cessation, and he has 
set up his easel. Such exquisite bits of wood, such light 
and shade, such dim depths of fragrance, — ah, how he 
has revelled in it all I 

Will she not study them all with jealous eyes? He 
remembers her outbreak. 

Still, as a guardian, he owes her some duty. If this 
could only be relegated to some one else ; but he is not the 
man to shirk a clear responsibility, after all. Still he 
delays it until the very last moment, and reaches Meadow- 
croft to And the house full of guests, some of them old 
friends who greet him delightedly. There is just time to 



 



 




dress for dinner. Miss Ormiston does not appear, but 
Dolly comes down to the drawing-room in the evening. 

" Guess who is here ?" Dolly says, abruptly, as she finds 
Christmas reading in the school-room. " You should have 
come down. Learn to make the most of your opportuni- 
ties, my dear." 

"Any one of supreme importance?" Christmas asks 
indifferently. 

< ' How provoking you are I Importance I Yes, indeed. 
Lu made big eyes at him, and Mr. Trafford was inclined 
to be jealous. Do you know, I have about resolved to 
try my hand, or my fascinations. If he were not so 
old — " 

" It is Mr. St. G-eorge," returns Christmas, quietly. 

" Yes ; and he asked so many questions about you that 
I was positively jealous." 

" I do not know why it should affect you that way," 
returns Christmas in a dry and rather caustic tone ; but it 
is lost upon Dolly, who rattles on, — 

"He has grown ever so much handsomer. Is there 
something in the air of Glen Ormiston? He was describ- 
ing it most enthusiastically to Helen, and he has been 
painting it. You must know that, among his many accom- 
plishments, he is an artist, and he plays divinely. The 
perfect monster ! " And Dolly laughs. 

Christmas is silent. A curious flush of indignation 
heats her face and throbs in her pulses. He has taken 
the supreme right. He can live there with his friend ; he 
can wander about the most sacred haunts, while she is an 
exile. He can even transcribe them and take them away, 
and she has no right to complain. Was it for this her 
father toiled and suffered? 

The next morning she and Dolly are requested to 
iq)pear at luncheon. Usually when there are guests, or 
when the family is away, they take their meals in a pretty 
little room that at its utmost would only accommodate a 



 



 



 

quartette. Dolly complains loudly ; but Christinas is not 
fond of the state with which Mrs. Allaire likes to be 
surrounded. 

There is a rather elegant party assembled at Meadow- 
croft. Mr. and Mrs. Stannard, the clerical uncle and his 
wife, his wife's sister, who makes some pretensions to lit- 
erature, and who has just returned from the Orient; a 
lady artist, who paints merely for the love of it, but at 
the same time demands high prices ; and several fashion- 
able friends. Dolly is in such haste : she always hurries 
as if the number of her days would be brief and she 
was anxious to crowd them fuU, and she drags Christmas 
down the very instant the bell rings. They are both in 
white. Dolly's embroidered muslin full of little butterfly 
bows; Miss Ormiston's cashmere severely plain, with a 
cluster of red roses at her belt. 

Certainly she has changed since St. George saw her. 
She looks taller, but that may be her clinging gown ; she 
holds her head with a regal sort of dignity. Her complex- 
ion has cleared up, — it is delicate and creamy ; her eyes 
have softened to a kind of twilight hue. He remarks for 
the first time her abundant unglossy hair, in its peculiar 
shade of light-brown, worn in a great coil at the back, 
loosely twisted, not unlike a Greek statue. The slope of 
the neck and the tinted ear are perfect. She is not hand- 
some like Helen ; well, perhaps she is rather plain, or is 
it her dress and her hair brushed straight across her fore- 
head? There is a curious coldness about her, as if she 
stood, and was proud of standing, quite alone. That is 
not a feminine attribute to his mind.
