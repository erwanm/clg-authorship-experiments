sense and stand by your word ; this crowd has had all it 
can endure, and if you do any more to provoke it, the con- 
sequences will be on you. And while you're about it, see 
that the saloons are closed and kept closed until this trouble 
is settled. And keep your people out of the way — don't 
let them go about showing their guns and making faces." 

Without waiting to hear the superintendent's reply, Hal 
turned to the throng, and held up his hand for silence. 
" Men," he said, " we have a big job to do — we're going 
to organise a union. And we can't do it here in front of 
the hospital. We've made too much noise already. Let's 
go off quietly, and have our meeting on the dump in back 
of the power-house. Does that suit you ? " 

They answered that it suited them; and Hal, having 
seen the two women passed safely into the hospital, sprang 
down from the porch to lead the way. Jerry Minetti came 




to his side, trembling with delight ; and Hal clutched him 
by the arm and whispered, excitedly, " Sing, Jerry ! Sing 
them some Dago song! " 



 They got to the place appointed without any fight- 
ing. And meantime Hal had worked out in his mind a 
plan for communicating with this polyglot horde. He 
knew that half the men could not understand a word of 
English, and that half the remainder understood very 
little. Obviously, if he was to make matters clear to them, 
they must be sorted out according to nationality, and a re- 
liable interpreter found for each group. 

The process of sorting proved a slow one, involving no 
end of shouting and good-natured jostling — Polish here, 
Bohemian here, Greek here, Italian here ! When this job 
had been done, and a man found from each nationality who 
understood enough English to translate to his fellows, Hal 
started in to make a speech. But before he had spoken 
many sentences, pandemonium broke loose. All the in- 
terpreters started interpreting at the same time — and at 
the top of their lungs ; it was like a parade with the bands 
close together! Hal was struck dumb; then he began to 
laugh, and the various audiences began to laugh ; the ora- 
tors stopped, perplexed — then they too began to laugh. 
So wave after wave of merriment rolled over the throng; 
the mood of the assembly was changed all at once, from 
rage and determination to the wildest hilarity. Hal 
learned his first lesson in the handling of these hordes of 
child-like people, whose moods were quick, whose tempers 
were balanced upon a fine point. 

It was necessary for him to make his speech through to 
the end, and then move the various audiences apart, to be 
addressed by the various interpreters. But then arose a 
new difficulty. How could any one control these floods of 
eloquence ? How be sure that the message was not being 



 

distorted? Hal had been warned by Olson of company 
detectives who posed as workers, gaining the confidence of 
men in order to incite them to violence. And certainly 
some of these interpreters were violent-looking, and one's 
remarks sounded strange in their translations ! 

There was the Greek orator, for example; a wild man, 
with wild hair and eyes, who tore all his passions to tat- 
ters. He stood upon a barrel-head, with the light of two 
pit-lamps upon him, and some two score of his compatriots 
at his feet; he waved his arms, he shook his fists, he 
shrieked, he bellowed. But when Hal, becoming uneasy, 
went over and asked another English-speaking Greek what 
the orator was saying, the answer was that he was promis- 
ing that the law should be enforced in North Valley ! 

Hal stood watching this perfervid little man, a study 
in the possibilities of gesture. He drew back his shoul- 
ders and puffed out his chest, almost throwing himself 
backwards off the barrel-head; he was saying that the 
miners would be able to live like men. He crouched down 
and bowed his head, moaning; he was telling them what 
would happen if they gave up. He fastened his fingers in 
his long black hair and began tugging desperately; he 
pulled, and then stretched out his empty hands ; he pulled 
again, so hard that it almost made one cry out with pain to 
watch him. Hal asked what that was for ; and the answer 
was, " He say, l Stand by union ! Pull one hair, he come 
out ; pull all hairs, no come out ' ! " It carried one back to 
the days of iEsop and his fables! 

Tom Olson had told Hal something about the technique 
of an organiser, who wished to drill these ignorant hordes. 
He had to repeat and repeat, until the dullest in his audi- 
ence had grasped his meaning, had got into his head the 
all-saving idea of solidarity. When the various orators 
had talked themselves out, and the audiences had come 
back to the cinder-heap, Hal made his speech all over 
again, in words of one syllable, in the kind of pidgin- 



 

English which does duty in the camps. Sometimes he 
would stop to reinforce it with Greek or Italian or Slavish 
words he had picked up. Or perhaps his eloquence would 
inflame some one of the interpreters afresh, and he would 
wait while the man shouted a few sentences to his com- 
patriots. It was not necessary to consider the possi- 
bility of boring any one, for these were patient and long- 
suffering men, and now desperately in earnest. 

They were going to have a union ; they were going to do 
the thing in regular form, with membership cards and of- 
ficials chosen by ballot. So Hal explained to them, step 
by step. There was no use organising unless they meant 
to stay organised. They would choose leaders, one from 
each of the principal language groups; and these leaders 
would meet and draw up a set of demands, which would be 
submitted in mass-meeting, and ratified, and then pre- 
sented to the bosses with the announcement that until these 
terms were granted, not a single North Valley worker 
would go back into the pits. 

Jerry Minetti, who knew all about unions, advised Hal 
to enroll the men at once ; he counted on the psychological 
effect of having each man come forward and give in his 
name. But here at once they met a difficulty encountered 
by all would-be organisers — lack of funds. There must 
be pencils and paper for the enrollment; and Hal had 
emptied his pockets for Jack David! He was forced to 
borrow a quarter, and send a messenger off to the store. It 
was voted by the delegates that each member as he joined 
the union should be assessed a dime. There would have 
to be some telegraphing and telephoning if they were going 
to get help from the outside world. 

A temporary committee was named, consisting of Tim 
Eafferty, Wauchope and Hal, to keep the lists and the 
funds, and to run things until another meeting could be 
held on the morrow ; also a body-guard of a dozen of the 
sturdiest and most reliable men were named to stay by the 




 

committee. The messenger came back with pads and 
pencils, and sitting on the ground by the light of pit- 
lamps, the interpreters wrote down the names of the men 
who wished to join the union, each man in turn pledging 
his word for solidarity and discipline. Then the meeting 
was declared adjourned till daylight of the morrow, and 
the workers scattered to their homes to sleep, with a joy 
and sense of power such as few of them had ever known in 
their lives before. 



 The committee and its body-guard repaired to the 
dining-room of Keminitsky's, where they stretched them- 
selves out on the floor ; no one attempted to interfere with 
them, and while the majority snored peacefully, Hal and 
a small group sat writing out the list of demands which 
were to be submitted to the bosses in the morning. It 
was arranged that Jerry should go down to Pedro by the 
early morning train, to get into touch with Jack David 
and the union officials, and report to them the latest de- 
velopments. Because the officials were sure to have de- 
tectives following them, Hal warned Jerry to go to Mac- 
Kellar's house, and have MacKellar bring "Big Jack" 
to meet him there. Also Jerry must have MacKellar get 
the Gazette on the long distance phone, and tell Billy 
Keating about the strike. 

A hundred things like this Hal had to think of; his head 
was a-buzz with them, so that when he lay down to sleep he 
could not. He thought about the bosses, and what they 
might be doing. The bosses would not be sleeping, he felt 
sure! 

And then came thoughts about his private-car friends ; 
about the strangeness of this plight into which he had got 
himself ! He laughed aloud in a kind of desperation as he 
recalled Percy's efforts to get him away from here. And 
poor Jessie ! What could he say to her now ?

The bosses made no move that night ; and when morn- 
ing came, the strikers hurried to the meeting-place, some 
of them without even stopping for breakfast. They came 
tousled and unkempt, looking anxiously at their fellows, as 
if unable to credit the memory of the bold thing they had 
done on the night before. But finding the committee and 
its body-guard on hand and ready for business, their cour- 
age revived, they felt again the wonderful sentiment of 
solidarity which had made men of them. Pretty soon 
speech-making began, and cheering and singing, which 
brought out the laggards and the cowards. So in a short 
while the movement was in full swing, with practically 
every man, woman and child among the workers present. 

Mary Burke came from the hospital, where she had 
spent the night. She looked weary and bedraggled, but 
her spirit of battle had not slumped. She reported that 
she had talked with some of the injured men, and that 
many of them had signed " releases," whereby the com- 
pany protected itself against even the threat of a lawsuit. 
Others had refused to sign, and Mary had been vehement 
in warning them to stand out. Two other women volun- 
teered to go to the hospital, in order that she might have a 
chance to rest ; but Mary did not wish to rest, she did not 
feel as if she could ever rest again. 

The members of the newly-organised union proceeded to 
elect officers. They sought to make Hal president, but he 
was shy of binding himself in that irrevocable way, and 
succeeded in putting the honour off on Wauchope. Tim 
Rafferty was made treasurer and secretary. Then a com- 
mittee was chosen to go to Cartwright with the demands of 
the men. It included Hal, Wauchope, and Tim ; an Ital- 
ian named Marcelli, whom Jerry had vouched for ; a repre- 
sentative of the Slavs and one of the Greeks — Rusick and 
Zammakis, both of them solid and faithful men. Finally, 
with a good deal of laughter and cheering, the meeting 
voted to add Mary Burke to this committee. It was a new 




 

thing to have a woman in such a role, but Mary was the 
daughter of a miner and the sister of a breaker-boy, and 
had as good a right to speak as any one in North Valley. 



 Hal read the document which had been prepared 
the night before. They demanded the right to have a 
union without being discharged for it. They demanded a 
check-weighman, to be elected by the men themselves. 
They demanded that the mines should be sprinkled to pre- 
vent explosions, and properly timbered to prevent falls. 
They demanded the right to trade at any store they pleased. 
Hal called attention to the fact that every one of these de- 
mands was for a right guaranteed by the laws of the state ; 
this was a significant fact, and he urged the men not to in- 
clude other demands. After some argument they voted 
down the proposition of the radicals, who wanted a ten 
per cent, increase in wages. Also they voted down the 
proposition of a syndicalist-anarchist, who explained to 
them in a jujuble of English and Italian that the mines 
belonged to them, and that they should refuse all com- 
promise and turn the bosses out forthwith. 

While this speech was being delivered, young Rovetta 
pushed his way through the crowd and drew Hal to one 
side. He had been down by the railroad-station and seen 
the morning train come in. From it had descended a 
crowd of thirty or forty men, of that " hard citizen " type 
which every miner in the district could recognise at the 
first glance. Evidently the company officials had been 
keeping the telephone-wires busy that night; they were 
bringing in, not merely this train-load of guards, but auto- 
mobile loads from other camps — from the Northeastern 
down the canyon, and from Barela, in a side canyon over 
the mountain. 

Hal told this news to the meetings which received it 
with howls of rage. So that was the bosses' plan ! Hot- 



 

heads sprang upon the cinder-heap, half a dozen of them 
trying to make speeches at once. The leaders had to sup- 
press these too impetuous ones by main force; once more 
Hal gave the warning of " No fighting ! " They were go- 
ing to have faith in their union ; they were going to present 
a solid front to the company, and the company would learn 
the lesson that intimidation would not win a strike. 

So it was agreed, and the committee set out for the com- 
pany's office, Wauchope carrying in his hand the written 
demands of the meeting. Behind the committee marched 
the crowd in a solid mass ; they packed the street in front 
of the office, while the heroic seven went up the steps and 
passed into the building. Wauchope made inquiry for 
Mr. Cartwright, and a clerk took in the message. 

They stood waiting; and meanwhile, one of the office- 
people, coming in from the street, beckoned to Hal. He 
had an envelope in his hand, and gave it over without a 
word. It was addressed, " Joe Smith," and Hal opened 
it, and found within a small visiting card, at which he 
stared. " Edward S. Warner, Jr." ! 

For a moment Hal could hardly believe the evidence of 
his eyesight Edward in North Valley! Then, turning 
the card over, he read, in his brother's familiar handwrit- 
ing, " I am at Cartwright's house. I must see you. The 
matter concerns Dad. Come instantly." 

Fear leaped into Hal's heart. What could such a mes- 
sage mean? 

He turned quickly to the committee and explained. 
" My father's an old man, and had a stroke of apoplexy 
three years ago. I'm afraid he may be dead, or very ill. 
I must go." 

" It's a trick ! " cried Wauchope excitedly. 

"No, not possibly," answered Hal. "I know my 
brother's handwriting. I must see him." 

" Well," declared the other, " we'll wait. We'll not see 
Cartwright until you get back." 



 

Hal considered this. " I don't think that's wise," he 
said. " You can do what you have to do just as well with- 
out me." 

" But I wanted you to do the talking ! " 

" No," replied Hal, " that's your business, Wauchope. 
You are the president of the union. You know what the 
men want, as well as I do j you know what they complain 
of. And besides, there's not going to be any need of talk- 
ing with Cartwright Either he's going to grant our de- 
mands or he isn't." 

They discussed the matter back and forth. Mary Burke 
insisted that they were pulling Hal away just at the criti- 
cal moment I He laughed as he answered. She was as 
good as any man when it came to an argument. If Wau- 
chope showed signs of weakening, let her speak up ! 



 So Hal hurried off, and climbed the street which 
led to the superintendent's house, a concrete bungalow set 
upon a little elevation overlooking the camp. He rang the 
bell, and the door opened, and in the entrance stood his 
brother. 

Edward Warner was eight years older than Hal; the 
perfect type of the young American business man. His 
figure was erect and athletic, his features were regular and 
strong, his voice, his manner, everything about him spoke 
of quiet decision, of energy precisely directed. As a rule, 
he was a model of what the tailor's art could do, but just 
now there was something abnormal about his attire as well 
as his manner. 

Hal's anxiety had been increasing all the way up the 
street. " What's the matter with Dad ? " he cried. 

" Dad's all right," was the answer — " that is, for the 
moment." 

"Then what — ?" 

"Peter Harrigan's on his way back from the East. 



 

He's due in Western City to-morrow. You can see that 
something will be the matte* with Dad unless you quit this 
business at once." 

Hal had a sudden reaction from his fear. " So that's 
all ! " he exclaimed. 

His brother was gazing at the young miner, dressed in 
sooty blue overalls, his face streaked with black, his wavy 
hair all mussed. " You wired me you were going to 
leave here, Hal ! " 

" So I was ; but things happened that I couldn't fore- 
see. There's a strike." 

" Yes ; but what's that got to do with it ? " Then, with 
exasperation in his voice, " For God's sake, Hal, how much 
farther do you expect to go ? " 

Hal stood for a few moments, looking at his brother. 
Even in a tension as he was, he could not help laughing. 
" I know how all this must seem to you, Edward. It's a 
long story ; I hardly know how to begin." 

" No, I suppose not," said Edward, drily. 

And Hal laughed again. " Well, we agree that far, at 
any rate. What I was hoping was that we could talk it all 
over quietly, after the excitement was past. When I ex- 
plain to you about conditions in this place — " 

But Edward interrupted. " Really, Hal, there's no use 
of such an argument. I have nothing to do with condi- 
tions in Peter Harrigan's camps." 

The smile left Hal's face. "Would you have pre- 
ferred to have me investigate conditions in the Warner 
camps ? " Hal had tried to suppress his irritation, but 
there was simply no way these two could get along. 
"We've had our arguments about these things, Edward, 
and you've always had the best of me — you could tell me 
I was a child, it was presumptuous of me to dispute your 
assertions. But now — well, I'm a child no longer, and 
we'll have to meet on a new basis." 

Hal's tone, more than his words, made an impression. 



 

Edward thought before he spoke. "Well, what's your 
new basis ? " 

" Just now I'm in the midst of a strike, and I can hardly 
stop to explain." 

" You don't think of Dad in all this madness ? " 

" I think of Dad, and of you too, Edward ; but this is 
hardly the time — " 

" If ever in the world there was a time, this is it ! " 

Hal groaned inwardly. "All right," he said, "sit 
down. I'll try to give you some idea how I got swept into 
this." 

He began to tell about the conditions he had found in 
this stronghold of the " G. F. C." As usual, when he 
talked about it, he became absorbed in its human as- 
pects ; a fervour came into his tone, he was carried on, as 
he had been when he tried to argue with the officials in 
Pedro. But his eloquence was interrupted, even as it had 
been then; he discovered that his brother was in such a 
state of exasperation that he could not listen to a con- 
secutive argument. 

It was the old, old story ; it had been thus as far back as 
Hal could remember. It seemed one of the mysteries of 
nature, how she could have brought two such different 
temperaments out of the same parentage. Edward was 
practical and positive; he knew what he wanted in the 
world, and he knew how to get it ; he was never troubled 
with doubts, nor with self -questioning, nor with any other 
superfluous emotions ; he could not understand people who 
allowed that sort of waste in their mental processes. He 
could not understand people who got " swept into things." 

In the beginning, he had had with Hal the prestige of 
the elder brother. He was handsome as a young Greek 
god, he was strong and masterful ; whether he was flying 
over the ice with sure, strong strokes, or cutting the water 
with his glistening shoulders, or bringing down a partridge 
with the certainty and swiftness of a lightning stroke, 



 

Edward was the incarnation of Success. When he said 
that one's ideas were " rot," when he spoke with contempt 
of " mollycoddles " — then indeed one suffered in soul, and 
had to go back to Shelley and Buskin to renew one's 
courage. 

The questioning of life had begun very early with Hal ; 
there seemed to be something in his nature which forced 
him to go to the roots of things ; and much as he looked 
up to his wonderful brother, he had been made to realise 
that there were sides of life to which this brother was 
blind. To begin with, there were religious doubts; the 
distresses of mind which plague a young man when first 
it dawns upon him that the faith he has been brought up 
in is a higher kind of fairy-tale. Edward had never 
asked such questions, apparently. He went to church, be- 
cause it was the thing to do ; more especially because it was 
pleasing to the young lady he wished to marry to have him 
put on stately clothes, and escort her to a beautiful place 
of music and flowers and perfumes, where she would meet 
her friends, also in stately clothes. How abnormal it 
seemed to Edward that a young man should give up this 
pleasant custom, merely because he could not be sure that 
Jonah had swallowed a whale! 

But it was when Hal's doubts attacked his brother's 
week-day religion — the religion of the profit-system — 
that the controversy between them had become deadly. 
At first Hal had known nothing about practical affairs, 
and it had been Edward's duty to answer his questions. 
The prosperity of the country had been built up by strong 
men ; and these men had enemies — evil-minded persons, 
animated by jealousy and other base passions, seeking to 
tear down the mighty structure. At first this devil-theory 
had satisfied the boy ; but later on, as he had come to read 
and observe, he had been plagued by doubts. In the end, 
listening to his brother's conversation, and reading the 



 

writings of so-called "muck-rakers," the realisation was 
forced upon him that there were two types of mind in the 
controversy — those who thought of profits, and those who 
thought of human beings. 

Edward was alarmed at the books Hal was reading ; he 
was still more alarmed when he saw the ideas Hal was 
bringing home from college. There must have been some 
strange change in Harrigan in a few years; no one had 
dreamed of such ideas when Edward was there! No one 
had written satiric songs about the faculty, or the endow- 
ments of eminent philanthropists! 

In the meantime Edward Warner Senior had had a 
paralytic stroke, and Edward Junior had taken charge of 
the company. Three years of this had given him the point 
of view of a coal-operator, hard and set for a life-time. 
The business of a coal-operator was to buy his labour 
cheap, to turn out the maximum product in the shortest 
time, and to sell the product at the market price to parties 
whose credit was satisfactory. If a concern was doing 
that, it was a successful concern ; for any one to mention 
that it was making wrecks of the people who dug the coal, 
was to be guilty of sentimentality and impertinence. 

Edward had heard with dismay his brother's announce- 
ment that he meant to study industry by spending his va- 
cation as a common labourer. However, when he consid- 
ered it, he was inclined 'to think that the idea might not 
be such a bad one. Perhaps Hal would not find what he 
was looking for; perhaps, working with his hands, he 
might get some of the nonsense knocked out of his head ! 

But now the experiment had been made, and the reve- 
lation had burst upon Edward that it had been a ghastly 
failure. Hal had not come to realise that labour was 
turbulent and lazy and incompetent, needing a strong hand 
to rule it; on the contrary, he had become one of these 
turbulent ones himself ! A champion of the lazy and in- 



 

competent, an agitator, a fomenter of class-prejudice, an 
enemy of his own friends, and of his brother's business 
associates ! 

Never had Hal seen Edward in such a state of excite- 
ment. There was something really abnormal about hiii, 
Hal realised ; it puzzled him vaguely while he talked, but 
he did not understand it until his brother told how he had 
come to be here. He had been attending a dinner-dance 
at the home of a friend, and Percy Harrigan had got him 
on the telephone at half past eleven o'clock at night. 
Percy had had a message from Cartwright, to the effect 
that Hal was leading a riot in North Valley; Percy had 
painted the situation in such lurid colours that Edward 
had made a dash and caught the midnight train, wearing 
his evening clothes, and without so much as a tooth-brush 
with him ! 

Hal could hardly keep from bursting out laughing. 
His brother, his punctilious and dignified brother, alight- 
ing from a sleeping-car at seven o'clock in the morning, 
wearing a dress suit and a silk hat! And here he was, 
Edward Warner Junior, the fastidious, who never paid 
less than a hundred and fifty dollars for a suit of clothes, 
clad in a " hand-me-down " for which he had expended 
twelve dollars and forty-eight cents in a " Jew-store " in 
a coal-town ! 



 But Edward would not stop for a single smile; 
his every faculty was absorbed in the task he had before 
him, to get his brother out of this predicament, so dan- 
gerous and so humiliating. Hal had come to a town 
owned by Edward's business friends, and had proceeded 
to meddle in their affairs, to stir up their labouring people 
and imperil their property. That North Valley was the 
property of the General Fuel Company — not merely the 
mines and the houses, but likewise the people who lived in 



 

them — Edward seemed to have no doubt whatever ; Hal 
got only exclamations of annoyance when he suggested 
any other point of view. Would there have been any town 
o^ North Valley, if it had not been for the capital and 
energy of the General Fuel Company ? If the people of 
North Valley did not like the conditions which the General 
Fuel Company offered them, they had one simple and 
obvious remedy — to go somewhere else to work. But 
they stayed; they got out the General Fuel Company's 
coal, they took the General Fuel Company's wages — 

" Well, they've stopped taking them now," put in Hal. 

All right, that was their affair, replied Edward. But 
let them stop because they wanted to — not because out- 
side agitators put them up to it. At any rate, let the agi- 
tators not include a member of the Warner family ! 

The elder brother pictured old Peter Harrigan on his 
way back from the East ; the state of unutterable fury in 
which he would arrive, the storm he would raise in the 
business world of Western City. Why, it was unimagin- 
able, such a thing had never been heard of ! " And right 
when we're opening up a new mine — when we need every 
dollar of credit we can get ! " 

"Aren't we big enough* to stand off Peter Harrigan?" 
inquired Hal. 

" We have plenty of other people to stand off," was the 
answer. " We don't have to go out of our way to make 
enemies." 

Edward spoke, not merely as the elder brother, but also 
as the money-man of the family. When the father had 
broken down from over-work, and had been changed in one 
terrible hour from a driving man of affairs into a childish 
and pathetic invalid, Hal had been glad enough that there 
was one member of the family who was practical ; he had 
been perfectly willing to see his brother shoulder these 
burdens, while he went off to college, to amuse himself 
with satiric songs. Hal had no responsibilities, no one 



 

asked anything of him — except that he would not throw 
sticks into the wheels of the machine his brother was run- 
ning. "You are living by the coal industry! Every 
dollar you spend comes from it — " 

"I know it! I know it!" cried HaL "That's the 
thJTig that torments me! The fact that I'm living upon 
the bounty of such wage-slaves — " 

" Oh, cut it out ! " cried Edward. " That's not what I 
mean! " 

" I know — but it's what   mean ! From now on I 
mean to know about the people who work for me, and 
what sort of treatment they get. I'm no longer your kid- 
brother, to be put off with platitudes." 

" You know ours are union mines, Hal — " 

" Yes, but what does that mean? How do we work it? 
Do we give the men their weights ? " 

" Of course ! They have their check-weighmen." 

" But then, bow do we compete with the operators in 
this district, who pay for a ton of three thousand pounds I " 

" We manage it — by economy." 

" Economy? I don't see Peter Harrigan wasting any- 
thing here ! " Hal paused for an answer, but none came. 
" Do we buy the check-weighmen? Do we bribg the la- 
bour leaders ? " 

Edward coloured slightly. " What's the use of being 
nasty, Hal ? You know I don't do dirty work." 

" I don't mean to be nasty, Edward ; but you must know 
that many a business-man can say he doesn't do dirty 
work, because he has others do it for him. What about 
politics, for instance ? Do we run a machine, and put our 
clerks and bosses into the local offices ? " 

Edward did not answer, and Hal persisted, " I mean 
to know these things! I'm not going to be blind any 
more ! " 

"All right, Hal — you can know anything you want; 
but for God's sake, not now ! If you want to be taken for 



 

& man, show a man's common sense! Here's Old Peter 
getting back to Western City to-morrow night ! Don't 
you know that he'll be after me, raging like a mad bull ? 
Don't you know that if I tell him I can do nothing — that 
Fve been down here and tried to pull you away — don't 
you know he'll go after Dad ? " 

Edward had tried all the arguments, and this was the 
only one that counted. " You must keep him away from 
Dad ! " exclaimed Hal. 

" You tell me that ! " retorted the other. " And when 
you know Old Peter! Don't you know he'll get at him, 
if he has to break down the door of the house? He'll 
throw the burden of his rage on that poor old man! 
You've been warned about it clearly; you know it may be 
a matter of life and death to keep Dad from getting ex- 
cited. I don't know what he'd do ; maybe he'd fly into a 
rage with you, maybe he'd defend you. He's old and 
weak, he's lost his grip on things. Anyhow, he'd not let 
Peter abuse you — and like as not he'd drop dead in the 
midst of the dispute ! Do you want to have that on your 
conscience, along with the troubles of your workingmen 
friends?" 



 Hal sat staring in front of him, silent. Was 
it a fact that every man had something in his life which 
palsied his arm, and struck him helpless in the battle for 
social justice ? 

When he spoke again, it was in a low voice. " Edward, 
I'm thinking about a young Irish boy who works in these 
mines. He, too, has a father ; and this father was caught 
in the explosion. He's an old man, with a wife and seven 
other children. He's a good man, the boy's a good boy. 
Let me tell you what Peter Harrigan has done to them ! " 

"Well," said Edward, "whatever it is, it's all right, 
you can help them. They won't need to starve." 



 

"I know," said Hal, "but there are so many others; 
I can't help them alL And besides, can't you see, Ed- 
ward — what I'm thinking about is not charity, but jus- 
tice* Fm sore this boy, Tim Bafferty, loves his father 
just exactly as much as I love my father; and there are 
other old men here, with sons who love them — " 

" Oh, Hal, for Christ's sake ! " exclaimed Edward, in 
a sort of explosion. He had no other words to express his 
impatience. ** Do you expect to take all the troubles in 
the world on your shoulders ? " And he sprang up and 
caught the other by the arm. " Boy, you've got to come 
away from here ! " 

Hal got up, without answering. He seemed irresolute, 
and his brother started to draw him towards the door. 
<   Ire got a car here. We can get a train in an hour — " 

Hal saw that he had to speak firmly. " No, Edward," 
he said. u I can't come just yet" 

" I tell vou vou must come ! " 

'' I can't* I made these men a promise ! " 

*    In God's name — what are these men to you ? Com- 
pared with your own father ! " 

'' I can't explain it, Edward. I've talked for half an 
hour, and I don't think you've even heard me. Suffice 
it to say that I see these people caught in a trap — and one 
that my whole life has helped to make. I can't leave 
them in it* What's more, I don't believe Dad would 
want me to do it, if he understood ' 

The other made a last effort at self-control. " I'm not 
going to call you a sentimental fool. Only, let me ask 
you one {Jain question. What do you think you can do 
for these people ! " 

'' I think I can help to win decent conditions for them." 

" Good God ! " cried Edward ; he sighed, in his agony 
of exasperation. "In Peter Harrigan's mines! Don't 
you realise that he'll pick them up and throw them out of 



 

here, neck and crop — the whole crew, every- man in the 
town, if necessary f " 

" Perhaps," answered Hal ; " but if the men in the other 
mines should join them — if the big union outside should 
stand by them — " 

" You're dreaming, Hal ! You're talking like a child ! 
I talked to the superintendent here; he had telegraphed 
the situation to Old Peter, and had just got an answer. 
Already he's acted, no doubt." 

" Acted ? " echoed Hal. " How do you mean ? " He 
was staring at his brother in sudden anxiety. 

" They were going to turn the agitators out, of course." 

" What? And while I'm here talking! " 

Hal turned toward the door. " You knew it all the 
time ! " he exclaimed. " You kept me here deliberately ! " 

He was starting away, but Edward sprang and caught 
him. " What could you have done ? " 

" Turn me loose ! " cried Hal, angrily. 

" Don't be a fool, Hal ! I've been trying to keep you 
out of the trouble. There may be fighting." 

Edward threw himself between Hal and the door, and 
there was a sharp struggle. But the elder man was no 
longer the athlete, the young bronzed god; he had been 
sitting at a desk in an office, while Hal had been doing 
hard labour. Hal threw him to one side, and in a mo- 
ment more had sprung out of the door, and was running 
down the slope. 



 Coming to the main street of the village, Hal 
saw the crowd in front of the office. One glance told 
him that something had happened. Men were running 
this way and that, gesticulating, shouting. Some were 
coming in his direction, and when they saw him they be- 
gan to yell to him. The first to reach him was Klowoski, 



 

the little Pole, breathless; gasping with excitement 
" They fire our committee! " 

"Fire them?" 

" Fire 'em out ! Down canyon ! " The little man was 
waving his arms in wild gestures; his eyes seemed about 
to start out of his head. " Take 'em off ! Whole bunch 
fellers — gunmen! People see them — come out back 
door. Got ever'body's arm tied. Gunmen fellers hold 
'em, don't let 'em holler, can't do nothin'l Grot them 
cars waitin' — what you call? — " 

" Automobiles ? " 

" Sure, got three ! Put ever'body in, quick like that — 
they go down road like wind ! Go down canyon, all gone! 
They bust our strike ! " And the little Pole's voice ended 
in a howl of despair. 

" No, they won't bust our strike ! " exclaimed HaL 
"Not yet!" 

Suddenly he was reminded of the fact that his brother 
had followed him — puffing hard, for the run had been 
strenuous. He caught Hal by the arm, exclaiming, 
" .Keep out of this, I tell you ! " 

Thus while Hal was questioning Klowoski, he was strug- 
gling half-unconsciously, to free himself from his brother's 
grasp. Suddenly the matter was forced to an issue, for 
the little Polack emitted a cry like an angry cat, and went
