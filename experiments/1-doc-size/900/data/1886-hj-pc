of the way when he was wanted, and brought him to the 



  



big, square-faced, deep-voiced lady who took up, as it were, 
all that side of the room. But Mrs. Bowerbank laid no 
hand upon him ; she only dropped her gaze from a 
tremendous height, and her forbearance seemed a tribute 
to that fragility of constitution on which Miss Pynsent 
desired to insist, just as her continued gravity was an 
implication that this scrupulous woman might well not 
know what to do. 

'Speak to the lady nicely, and tell her you are very 
sorry to have kept her waiting.' 

The child hesitated a moment, while he reciprocated 
Mrs. Bowerbank's inspection, and then he said, with a 
strange, cool, conscious indifference (Miss Pynsent instantly recognised it as his aristocratic manner), ' I don't 
think she can have been in a very great hurry.' 

There was irony in the words, for it is a remarkable fact 
that even at the age of ten Hyacinth Robinson was 
ironical ; but the subject of his allusion, who was not 
nimble withal, appeared not to interpret it; so that she 
rejoined only by remarking, over his head, to Miss Pynsent, 
' It's the very face of her over again ! ' 

' Of her ? But what do you say to Lord Frederick ? ' 

' I have seen lords that wasn't so dainty ! ' 

Miss Pynsent had seen very few lords, but she entered, 
with a passionate thrill, into this generalisation ; controlling 
herself, however, for she remembered the child was 
tremendously sharp, sufficiently to declare, in an edifying 
tone, that he would look more like what he ought to if his 
face were a little cleaner. 

' It was probably Millicent Henning dirtied my face 
when she kissed me,' the boy announced, with slow gravity, 
looking all the while at Mrs. Bowerbank. He exhibited 
not a symptom of shyness. 

' Millicent Henning is a very bad little girl ; she'll come 
to no good,' said Miss Pynsent, with familiar decision, and 
also, considering that the young lady in question had been 
her effective messenger, with marked ingratitude. 

Against this qualification the child instantly protested. 
' Why is she bad ? I don't think she is bad ; I like her 
very much.' It came over him that he had too hastily 
shifted to her shoulders the responsibility of his unseemly 
appearance, and he wished to make up to her for that 
betrayal. He dimly felt that nothing but that particular 
accusation could have pushed him to it, for he hated people 
who were not fresh, who had smutches and streaks. Millicent Henning generally had two or three, which she 
borrowed from her doll, into whom she was always rubbing 
her nose and whose dinginess was contagious. It was 
quite inevitable she should have left her mark under his 
own nose when she claimed her reward for coming to tell 
him about the lady who wanted him. 

Miss Pynsent held the boy against her knee, trying to 
present him so that Mrs. Bowerbank should agree with her 
about his having the air of race. He was exceedingly 
diminutive, even for his years, and though his appearance 
was not positively sickly it seemed written in his attenuated 
little person that he would never be either tall or strong. 
His dark blue eyes were separated by a wide interval, which 
increased the fairness and sweetness of his face, and his 
abundant curly hair, which grew thick and long, had the 
golden brownness predestined to elicit exclamations of 
delight from ladies when they take the inventory of a child. 



His features were smooth and pretty; his head was set 
upon a slim little neck; his expression, grave and clear, 
showed a quick perception as well as a great credulity; 
and he was altogether, in his innocent smallness, a refined 
and interesting figure. 

' Yes, he's one that would be sure to remember,' said 
Mrs. Bowerbank, mentally contrasting him with the undeveloped members of her own brood, who had never been 
retentive of anything but the halfpence which they occasionally contrived to filch from her. Her eyes descended 
to the details of his toilet : the careful mending of his short 
breeches and his long, coloured stockings, which she was 
in a position to appreciate, as well as the knot of bright 
ribbon which the dressmaker had passed into his collar, 
slightly crumpled by Miss Henning's embrace. Of course 
Miss Pynsent had only one to look after, but her visitor 
was obliged to recognise that she had the highest standard 
in respect to buttons. ' And you do turn him out so it's a 
pleasure,' she went on, noting the ingenious patches in the 
child's shoes, which, to her mind, were repaired for all the 
world like those of a little nobleman. 

' I'm sure you're very civil,' said Miss Pynsent, in a state 
of severe exaltation. ' There's never a needle but mine has 
come near him. That's exactly what I think : the impres- 
sion would go so deep.' 

' Do you want to see me only to look at me ? ' Hyacinth 
inquired, with a candour which, though unstudied, had 
again much of the force of satire. 

' I'm sure it's very kind of the lady to notice you at all ! ' 
cried his protectress, giving him an ineffectual jerk. 'You're no 
bigger than a flea ; there are many that wouldn't spy you out.' 

' You'll find he's big enough, I expect, when he begins 
to go,' Mrs. Bowerbank remarked, tranquilly ; and she added 
that now she saw how he was turned out she couldn't but 
feel that the other side was to be considered. In her effort 
to be discreet, on account of his being present (and so pre- 
cociously attentive), she became slightly enigmatical; but Miss 
Pynsent gathered her meaning, which was that it was very 
true the child would take everything in and keep it : but at 
the same time it was precisely his being so attractive that 
made it a kind of sin not to gratify the poor woman, who, 
if she knew what he looked like to-day, wouldn't forgive his 
adoptive mamma for not producing him. ' Certainly, in 
her place, I should go off easier if I had seen them curls,' 
Mrs. Bowerbank declared, with a flight of maternal imagination which brought her to her feet, while Miss Pynsent 
felt that she was leaving her dreadfully ploughed up, and 
without any really fertilising seed having been sown. The 
little dressmaker packed the child upstairs to tidy himself 
for his tea, and while she accompanied her visitor to the 
door told her that if she would have a little more patience 
with her she would think a day or two longer what was 
best and write to her when she should have decided. Mrs. 
Bowerbank continued to move in a realm superior to poor 
Miss Pynsent's vacillations and timidities, and her impartiality gave her hostess a high idea of her respectability ; 
but the way was a little smoothed when, after Amanda had 
moaned once more, on the threshold, helplessly and irrelevantly, ' Ain't it a pity she's so bad ? ' the ponderous lady 
from the prison rejoined, in those tones which seemed 
meant to resound through corridors of stone, ' I assure you 
there's a many that's much worse ! ' 



II 

Miss PYNSENT, when she found herself alone, felt that she 
was really quite upside down ; for the event that had just 
occurred had never entered into her calculations : the very 
nature of the case had seemed to preclude it. All she knew, 
and all she wished to know, was that in one of the dreadful 
institutions constructed for such purposes her quondam 
comrade was serving out the sentence that had been substituted for the other (the unspeakable horror) almost when 
the halter was already round her neck. As there was no 
question of that concession being stretched any further, poor 
Florentine seemed only a little more dead than other people, 
having no decent tombstone to mark the place where she 
lay. Miss Pynsent had therefore never thought of her 
dying again ; she had no idea to what prison she had been 
committed on being removed from Newgate (she wished to 
keep her mind a blank about the matter, in the interest of 
the child), and it could not occur to her that out of such 
silence and darkness a second voice would reach her, 
especially a voice that she should really have to listen to. 
Miss Pynsent would have said, before Mrs. Bowerbank's 
visit, that she had no account to render to any one ; that 
she had taken up the child (who might have starved in the 
gutter) out of charity, and had brought him up, poor and 
precarious as her own subsistence had been, without a 
penny's help from another source; that the mother had 
forfeited every right and title ; and that this had been 
understood between them if anything, in so dreadful an 
hour, could have been said to be understood when she 
went to see her at Newgate (that terrible episode, nine 
years before, overshadowed all Miss Pynsent's other 
memories) : went to see her because Florentine had sent 
for her (a name, face and address coming up out of the 
still recent but sharply separated past of their working-girl 
years), as the one friend to whom she could appeal with 
some chance of a pitying answer. The effect of violent 
emotion, with Miss Pynsent, was not to make her sit with 
idle hands or fidget about to no purpose ; under its influence, on the contrary, she threw herself into little jobs, as a 
fugitive takes to by-paths, and clipped and cut, and stitched 
and basted, as if she were running a race with hysterics. 
And while her hands, her scissors, her needle flew, an 
infinite succession of fantastic possibilities trotted through 
her confused little head ; she had a furious imagination, 
and the act of reflection, in her mind, was always a 
panorama of figures and scenes. She had had her picture 
of the future, painted in rather rosy hues, hung up before 
her now for a good many years ; but it seemed to her that 
Mrs. Bowerbank's heavy hand had suddenly punched a hole 
in the canvas. It must be added, however, that if Amanda's 
thoughts were apt to be bewildering visions they sometimes 
led her to make up her mind, and on this particular Sep- 
tember evening she arrived at a momentous decision. 
What she made up her mind to was to take advice, and in 
pursuance of this view she rushed downstairs, and, jerking 



 

Hyacinth away from his simple but unfinished repast, 
packed him across the street to tell Mr. Vetch (if he had 
not yet started for the theatre) that she begged he would 
come in to see her when he came home that night, as she 
had something very particular she wished to say to him. 
It didn't matter if he should be very late, he could come in 
at any hour he would see her light in the window and 
he would do her a real mercy. Miss Pynsent knew it 
would be of no use for her to go to bed ; she felt as if she 
should never close her eyes again. Mr. Vetch was her 
most distinguished friend ; she had an immense appreciation of his cleverness and knowledge of the world, as well 
as of the purity of his taste in matters of conduct and 
opinion ; and she had already consulted him about Hyacinth's education. The boy needed no urging to go on 
such an errand, for he, too, had his ideas about the little 
fiddler, the second violin in the orchestra of the Bloomsbury 
Theatre. Mr. Vetch had once obtained for the pair an 
order for two seats at a pantomime, and for Hyacinth the 
impression of that ecstatic evening had consecrated him, 
placed him for ever in the golden glow of the footlights. 
There were things in life of which, even at the age of ten, 
it was a conviction of the boy's that it would be his fate 
never to see enough, and one of them was the wonder- 
world illuminated by those playhouse lamps. But there 
would be chances, perhaps, if one didn't lose sight of Mr. 
Vetch ; he might open the door again ; he was a privileged, 
magical mortal, who went to the play every night. 

He came in to see Miss Pynsent about midnight ; as 
soon as she heard the lame tinkle of the bell she went to 
the door to let him in. He was -an original, in the fullest 
sense of the word : a lonely, disappointed, embittered, 
cynical little man, whose musical organisation had been 
sterile, who had the nerves, the sensibilities, of a gentle- 
man, and whose fate had condemned him, for the last 
ten years, to play a fiddle at a second-rate theatre for 
a few shillings a week. He had ideas of his own about 
everything, and they were not always very improving. For 
Amanda Pynsent he represented art, literature (the literature 
of the play-bill), and philosophy, and she always felt about 
him as if he belonged to a higher social sphere, though his 
earnings were hardly greater than her own and he lived 
in a single back-room, in a house where she had never 
seen a window washed. He had, for her, the glamour of 
reduced gentility and fallen fortunes; she was conscious 
that he spoke a different language (though she couldn't 
have said in what the difference consisted) from the other 
members of her humble, almost suburban circle ; and the 
shape of his hands was distinctly aristocratic. (Miss Pyn- 
sent, as I have intimated, was immensely preoccupied with 
that element in life.) Mr. Vetch displeased her only by 
one of the facets of his character his blasphemous re- 
publican, radical views, and the contemptuous manner in 
which he expressed himself about the nobility. On that 
ground he worried her extremely, though he never seemed 
to her so clever as when he horrified her most. These 
dreadful theories (expressed so brilliantly that, really, they 
might have been dangerous if Miss Pynsent had not known 
her own place so well) constituted no presumption against 
his refined origin ; they were explained, rather, to a certain 
extent, by a just resentment at finding himself excluded 
from his proper place. Mr. Vetch was short, fat and bald, 

though he was not much older than Miss Pynsent, who was 
not much older than some people who called themselves 
forty-five ; he always went to the theatre in evening-dress, 
with a flower in his button-hole, and wore a glass in one 
eye. He looked placid and genial, and as if he would 
fidget at the most about the 'get up' of his linen; you 
would have thought him finical but superficial, and never 
have suspected that he was a revolutionist, or even a critic 
of life. Sometimes, when he could get away from the 
theatre early enough, he went with a pianist, a friend of his, 
to play dance-music at small parties ; and after such expedi- 
tions he was particularly cynical and startling ; he indulged 
in diatribes against the British middle-class, its Philistinism, 
its snobbery. He seldom had much conversation with 
Miss Pynsent without telling her that she had the in- 
tellectual outlook of a caterpillar ; but this was his privilege 
after a friendship now of seven years' standing, which had 
begun (the year after he came to live in Lomax Place) with 
her going over to nurse him, on learning from the milk- 
woman that he was alone at Number 17 laid up with an 
attack of gastritis. He always compared her to an insect 
or a bird, and she didn't mind, because she knew he liked 
her, and she herself liked all winged creatures. How 
indeed could she complain, after hearing him call the 
Queen a superannuated form and the Archbishop of 
Canterbury a grotesque superstition ? 

He laid his violin-case on the table, which was covered 
with a confusion of fashion-plates and pincushions, and 
glanced toward the fire, where a kettle was gently hissing. 
Miss Pynsent, who had put it on half an hour before, read 
his glance, and reflected with complacency that Mrs. Bower- 
bank had not absolutely drained the little bottle in the 
cheffonier. She placed it on the table again, this time 
with a single glass, and told her visitor that, as a great 
exception, he might light his pipe. In fact, she always 
made the exception, and he always replied to the gracious 
speech by inquiring whether she supposed the greengrocers' 
wives, the butchers' daughters, for whom she worked, had 
fine enough noses to smell, in the garments she sent home, 
the fumes of his tobacco. He knew her 'connection ' was confined to small shopkeepers, but she didn't wish others to know 
it, and would have liked them to believe it was important that 
the poor little stuffs she made up (into very queer fashions, 
I am afraid) should not surprise the feminine nostril. But it 
had always been impossible to impose on Mr. Vetch ; he 
guessed the truth, the untrimmed truth, about everything 
in a moment. She was sure he would do so now, in regard 
to this solemn question which had come up about Hyacinth ; 
he would see that though she was agreeably flurried at 
finding herself whirled in the last eddies of a case that had 
been so celebrated in its day, her secret wish was to shirk 
her duty (if it was a duty) ; to keep the child from ever 
knowing his mother's unmentionable history, the shame 
that attached to his origin, the opportunity she had had 
of letting him see the wretched woman before she died. 
She knew Mr. Vetch would read her troubled thoughts, 
but she hoped he would say they were natural and just : 
she reflected that as he took an interest in Hyacinth he 
wouldn't desire him to be subjected to a mortification that 
might rankle for ever and perhaps even crush him to the 
earth. She related Mrs. Bowerbank's visit, while he sat 
upon the sofa in the very place where that majestic woman 
had reposed, and puffed his smoke-wreaths into the dusky 
little room. He knew the story of the child's birth, had 
known it years before, so she had no startling revelation 
to make. He was not in the least agitated at learning that 
Florentine was dying in prison and had managed to get a 
message conveyed to Amanda; he thought this so much 
in the usual course that he said to Miss Pynsent, ' Did you 
expect her to live on there for ever, working out her terrible 
sentence, just to spare you the annoyance of a dilemma, or 
any reminder of her miserable existence, which you have 
preferred to forget ? ' That was just the sort of question 
Mr. Vetch was sure to ask, and he inquired, further, of his 
dismayed hostess, whether she were sure her friend's message 
(he called the unhappy creature her friend) had come to her 
in the regular way. The warders, surely, had no authority 
to introduce visitors to their captives ; and was it a question 
of her going off to the prison on the sole authority of Mrs. 
Bowerbank ? The little dressmaker explained that this lady 
had merely come to sound her, Florentine had begged so 
hard. She had been in Mrs. Bowerbank's ward before her 
removal to the infirmary, where she now lay ebbing away, 
and she had communicated her desire to the Catholic 
chaplain, who had undertaken that some satisfaction of 
inquiry, at least should be given her. He had thought 
it best to ascertain first whether the person in charge of the 
child would be willing to bring him, such a course being 
perfectly optional, and he had some talk with Mrs. Bower- 
bank on the subject, in which it was agreed between them 
that if she would approach Miss Pynsent and explain to 
her the situation, leaving her to do what she thought best, 
he would answer for it that the consent of the governor of 





the prison should be given to the interview. Miss Pynsent 
had lived for fourteen years in Lomax Place, and Florentine 
had never forgotten that this was her address at the time 
she came to her at Newgate (before her dreadful sentence 
had been commuted), and promised, in an outgush of pity 
for one whom she had known in the days of her honesty 
and brightness, that she would save the child, rescue it from 
the workhouse and the streets, keep it from the fate that 
had swallowed up the mother. Mrs. Bowerbank had a 
half-holiday, and a sister living also in the north of London, 
to whom she had been for some time intending a visit ; so 
that after her domestic duty had been performed it had been 
possible for her to drop in on Miss Pynsent in a natural, 
casual way and put the case before her. It would be just 
as she might be disposed to view it. She was to think it 
over a day or two, but not long, because the woman was 
so ill, and then write to Mrs. Bowerbank, at the prison. If 
she should consent, Mrs. Bowerbank would tell the chaplain, 
and the chaplain would obtain the order from the governor 
and send it to Lomax Place ; after which Amanda would 
immediately set out with her unconscious victim. But 
should she must she consent? That was the terrible, 
the heart-shaking question, with which Miss Pynsent's 
unaided wisdom had been unable to grapple. 

' After all, he isn't hers any more he's mine, mine only, 
and mine always. I should like to know if all I have done 
for him doesn't make him so ! ' It was in this manner that 
Amanda Pynsent delivered herself, while she plied her 
needle, faster than ever, in a piece of stuff that was pinned 
to her knee. 

Mr. Vetch watched her awhile, blowing silently at his 



 

pipe, with his head thrown back on the high, stiff, old- 
fashioned sofa, and his little legs crossed under him like a 
Turk's. 'It's true you have done a good deal for him. 
You are a good little woman, my dear Finnic, after all.' 
He said ' after all,' because that was a part of his tone. 
In reality he had never had a moment's doubt that she was 
the best little woman in the north of London. 

' I have done what I could, and I don't want no fuss 
made about it. Only it does make a difference when you 
come to look at it about taking him off to see another 
woman. And such another woman and in such a place ! 
I think it's hardly right to take an innocent child.' 

' I don't know about that ; there are people that would 
tell you it would do him good. If he didn't like the place 
as a child, he would take more care to keep out of it 
later.' 

' Lord, Mr. Vetch, how can you think ? And him such 
a perfect little gentleman ! ' Miss Pynsent cried. 

' Is it you that have made him one ? ' the fiddler asked. 
' It doesn't run in the family, you'd say.' 

' Family ? what do you know about that ? ' she replied, 
quickly, catching at her dearest, her only hobby. 

' Yes, indeed, what does any one know ? what did she 
know herself?' And then Miss Pynsent's visitor added, 
irrelevantly, ' Why should you have taken him on your back ? 
Why did you want to be so good ? No one else thinks it 
necessary.' 

' I didn't want to be good. That is, I do want to, of 
course, in a general way : but that wasn't the reason then. 
But I had nothing of my own I had nothing in the world 
but my thimble.' 





' That would have seemed to most people a reason for 
not adopting a prostitute's bastard.' 

' Well, I went to see him at the place where he was (just 
where she had left him, with the woman of the house), and 
I saw what kind of a shop that was, and felt it was a shame 
an innocent child should grow up in such a place.' Miss 
Pynsent defended herself as earnestly as if her inconsistency 
had been of a criminal cast. 'And he wouldn't have 
grown up, neither. They wouldn't have troubled them- 
selves long with a helpless baby. They'd have played some 
trick on him, if it was only to send him to the workhouse. 
Besides, I always was fond of tiny creatures, and I have 
been fond of this one,' she went on, speaking as if with a 
consciousness, on her own part, of almost heroic proportions. 
' He was in my way the first two or three years, and it was 
a good deal of a pull to look after the business and him 
together. But now he's like the business he seems to 
go of himself.' 

' Oh, if he flourishes as the business flourishes, 
you can just enjoy your peace of mind,' said the fiddler, 
still with his manner of making a small dry joke of every- 
thing. 

' That's all very well, but it doesn't close my eyes to that 
poor woman lying there and moaning just for the touch of 
his little 'and before she passes away. Mrs. Bowerbank 
says she believes I will bring him.' 

' Who believes ? Mrs. Bowerbank ? ' 

' I wonder if there's anything in life holy enough for you 
to take it seriously,' Miss Pynsent rejoined, snapping off a 
thread, with temper. ' The day you stop laughing I should 
like to be there.' 



 

' So long as you are there, I shall never stop. What is 
it you want me to advise you ? to take the child, or to leave 
the mother to groan herself out?' 

' I want you to tell me whether he'll curse me when he 
grows older.' 

' That depends upon what you do. However, he will 
probably do it in either case.' 

' You don't believe that, because you like him,' said 
Amanda, with acuteness. 

' Precisely ; and he'll curse me too. He'll curse every 
one. He won't be happy.' 

' I don't know how you think I bring him up,' the little 
dressmaker remarked, with dignity. 

' You don't bring him up ; he brings you up.' 

' That's what you have always said ; but you don't know. 
If you mean that he does as he likes, then he ought to be 
happy. It ain't kind of you to say he won't be,' Miss Pynsent 
added, reproachfully. 

' I would say anything you like, if what I say would 
help the matter. He's a thin-skinned, morbid, mooning 
little beggar, with a good deal of imagination and not 
much perseverance, who will expect a good deal more 
of life than he will find in it. That's why he won't be 
happy.' 

Miss Pynsent listened to this description of her protege 
with an appearance of criticising it mentally ; but in reality 
she didn't know what ' morbid ' meant, and didn't like to 
ask. ' He's the cleverest person I know, except yourself,' 
she said in a moment ; for Mr. Vetch's words had been in 
the key of what she thought most remarkable in him. What 
that was she would have been unable to say. 





' Thank you very much for putting me first,' the fiddler 
rejoined, after a series of puffs. ' The youngster is interest- 
ing, one sees that he has a mind, and in that respect he is 
I won't say unique, but peculiar. I shall watch him with 
curiosity, to see what he grows into. But I shall always be 
glad that I am a selfish brute of a bachelor, that I never 
invested in that class of goods.' 

' Well, you are comforting. You would spoil him more 
than I do,' said Amanda. 

'Possibly, but it would be in a different way. I 
wouldn't tell him every three minutes that his father was 
a duke.' 

' A duke I never mentioned ! ' the little dressmaker cried, 
with eagerness. ' I never specified any rank, nor said a 
word about any one in particular. I never so much as 
insinuated the name of his lordship. But I may have said 
that if the truth was to be found out, he might be proved 
to be connected in the way of cousinship, or something of 
the kind with the highest in the land. I should have 
thought myself wanting if I hadn't given him a glimpse of 
that. But there is one thing I have always added that 
the truth never is found out.' 

' You are still more comforting than I ! ' Mr. Vetch 
exclaimed. He continued to watch her, with his charitable, 
round-faced smile, and then he said, ' You won't do what I 
say ; so what is the use of my telling you ?' 

' I assure you I will, if you say you believe it's the only 
right.' 

' Do I often say anything so asinine ? Right right ? 
what have you to do with that ? If you want the only right, 
you are very particular,' 



 

' Please, then, what am I to go by ?' the dressmaker asked, 
bewildered. 

' You are to go by this, by what will take the youngster 
down.' 

'Take him down, my poor little pet?' 

' Your poor little pet thinks himself the flower of creation. 
I don't say there is any harm in that : a fine, blooming, 
odoriferous conceit is a natural appendage of youth and 
cleverness. I don't say there is any great harm in it, but 
if you want a guide as to how you are to treat the boy, that's 
as good a guide as any other.' 

'You want me to arrange the interview, then?' 

' I don't want you to do anything but give me another 
sip of brandy. I just say this : that I think it's a great gain, 
early in life, to know the worst ; then we don't live in a fool's 
paradise. I did that till I was nearly forty ; then I woke 
up and found I was in Lomax Place.' Whenever Mr. Vetch 
said anything that could be construed as a reference to a 
former position which had had elements of distinction, Miss 
Pynsent observed a respectful, a tasteful, silence, and that is 
why she did not challenge him now, though she wanted 
very much to say that Hyacinth was no more ' presumptious ' 
(that was the term she should have used) than he had 
reason to be, with his genteel figure and his wonderful 
intelligence; and that as for thinking himself a 'flower' of 
any kind, he knew but too well that he lived in a small 
black-faced house, miles away from the West End, rented 
by a poor little woman who took lodgers, and who, as they 
were of such a class that they were not always to be depended 
upon to settle her weekly account, had a strain to make 
two ends meet, in spite of the sign between her windows 





MISS AMANDA PYNSENT. 

Modes et Robes. 

DRESSMAKING IN ALL ITS BRANCHES. COURT-DRESSES, 
MANTLES AND FASHIONABLE BONNETS. 

Singularly enough, her companion, before she had per- 
mitted herself to interpose, took up her own thought (in one 
of its parts), and remarked that perhaps she would say of 
the child that he was, so far as his actual circumstances 
were concerned, low enough down in the world, without 
one's wanting him to be any lower. ' But by the time he's 
twenty, he'll persuade himself .that Lomax Place was a bad 
dream, that your lodgers and your dressmaking were as 
imaginary as they are vulgar, and that when an old friend 
came to see you late at night it was not your amiable 
practice to make him a glass of brandy and water. He'll 
teach himself to forget all this : he'll have a way.' 

'Do you mean he'll forget me, he'll deny me?' cried 
Miss Pynsent, stopping the movement of her needle, short 
off, for the first time. 

' As the person designated in that attractive blazonry on 
the outside of your house, ' decidedly he will ; and me, 
equally, as a bald-headed, pot-bellied fiddler, who regarded 
you as the most graceful and refined of his acquaintance. 
I don't mean he'll disown you and pretend he never knew 
you : I don't think he will ever be such an odious little 
cad as that ; he probably won't be a sneak, and he strikes 
me as having some love, and possibly even some gratitude, 
in him. But he will, in his imagination (and that will always 
persuade him), subject you to some extraordinary meta- 
morphosis ; he will dress you up.' 

' He'll dress me up ! ' Amanda ejaculated, quite ceasing 



 

to follow the train of Mr. Vetch's demonstration. ' Do you 
mean that he'll have the property that his relations will 
take him up ? ' 

' My dear, delightful, idiotic Pinnie, I am speaking in a 
figurative manner. I don't pretend to say what his precise 
position will be when we are relegated ; but I affirm that 
relegation will be our fate. Therefore don't stuff him with 
any more illusions than are necessary to keep him alive ; he 
will be sure to pick up enough on the way. On the con- 
trary, give him a good stiff dose of the truth at the start.' 

' Dear me, dear me, of course you see much further into 
it than I could ever do,' Pinnie murmured, as she threaded 
a needle. 

Mr. Vetch paused a minute, but apparently not out of 
deference to this amiable interruption. He went on suddenly, 
with a ring of feeling in his voice. ' Let him know, because 
it will be useful to him later, the state of the account 
between society and himself; he can then conduct himself 
accordingly. If he is the illegitimate child of a French 
good-for-naught who murdered one of her numerous lovers, 
don't shuffle out of sight so important a fact. I regard that 
as a most valuable origin.' 

'Lord, Mr. Vetch, how you talk!' cried Miss Pynsent, 
staring. ' I don't know what one would think, to hear 
you.' 

' Surely, my dear lady, and for this reason : that those 
are the people with whom society has to count. It hasn't 
with you and me.' Miss Pynsent gave a sigh which might 
have meant either that she was well aware of that, or that 
Mr. Vetch had a terrible way of enlarging a subject, especially 
when it was already too big for her ; and her philosophic . 


visitor went on : ' Poor little devil, let him see her, let him 
see her.' 

' And if later, when he's twenty, he says to me that if I 
hadn't meddled in it he need never have known, he need 
never have had that shame, pray what am I to say to him 
then ? That's what I can't get out of my head.' 

' You can say to him that a young man who is sorry for 
having gone to his mother when, in her last hours, she lay 
groaning for him on a pallet in a penitentiary, deserves more 
than the sharpest pang he can possibly feel.' And the little 
fiddler, getting up, went over to the fireplace and shook out 
the ashes of his pipe. 

'Well, I am sure it's natural he should feel badly,' said 
Miss Pynsent, folding up her work with the same desperate 
quickness that had animated her throughout the evening. 

' I haven't the least objection to his feeling badly ; that's 
not the worst thing in the world ! If a few more people 
felt badly, in this sodden, stolid, stupid race of ours, the 
world would wake up to an idea or two, and we should see 
the beginning of the dance. It's the dull acceptance, the 
absence of reflection, the impenetrable density.' Here Mr. 
Vetch stoppecl short; his hostess stood before him with 
eyes of entreaty, with clasped hands. 

' Now, Anastasius Vetch, don't go off into them dreadful 
wild theories ! ' she cried, always ungrammatical when she 
was strongly moved. ' You always fly away over the house- 
tops. I thought you liked him better the dear little un- 
fortunate.' 

Anastasius Vetch had pocketed his pipe ; he put on his 
hat with the freedom of old acquaintance and of Lomax 
Place, and took up his small coffin-like fiddle-case. ' My 



 

good Finnic, I don't think you understand a word I say. 
It's no use talking do as you like ! ' 

' Well, I must say I don't think it was worth your coming 
in at midnight only to tell me that. I don't like anything 
I hate the whole dreadful business ! ' 

He bent over, in his short plumpness, to kiss her hand, 
as he had seen people do on the stage. ' My dear friend, 
we have different ideas, and I never shall succeed in driving 
mine into your head. It's because I am fond of him, poor 
little devil ; but you will never understand that. I want 
him to know everything, and especially the worst the 
worst, as I have said. If I were in his position, I shouldn't 
thank you for trying to make a fool of me ! ' 

' A fool of you ? as if I thought of anything but his 'appi- 
ness !' Amanda Pynsent exclaimed. She stood looking at 
him, but following her own reflections ; she had given up 
the attempt to enter into his whims. She remembered, 
what she had noticed before, in other occurrences, that his 
reasons were always more extraordinary than his behaviour 
itself; if you only considered his life you wouldn't have 
thought him so fanciful. ' Very likely I think too much of 
that,' she added. ' She wants him and cries for him ; that's 
what keeps coming back to me.' She took up her lamp to 
light Mr. Vetch to the door (for the dim luminary in the 
passage had long since been extinguished), and before he 
left the house he turned, suddenly, stopping short, and said, 
his composed face taking a strange expression from the 
quizzical glimmer of his little round eyes 

' What does it matter after all, and why do you worry ? 
What difference can it make what happens on either side 
to such low people ? ' 



Ill 



MRS. BOWERBANK had let her know she would meet her, 
almost at the threshold of the dreadful place; and this 
thought had sustained Miss Pynsent in her long and devious 
journey, performed partly on foot, partly in a succession of 
omnibuses. She had had ideas about a cab, but she de- 
cided to reserve the cab for the return, as then, very likely, 
she should be so shaken with emotion, so overpoweringly 
affected, that it would be a comfort to escape from observa- 
tion. She had no confidence that if once she passed the 
door of the prison she should ever be restored to liberty 
and her customers ; it seemed to her an adventure as 
dangerous as it was dismal, and she was immensely touched 
by the clear-faced eagerness of the child at her side, who 
strained forward as brightly as he had done on another 
occasion, still celebrated in Miss Pynsent's industrious 
annals, a certain sultry Saturday in August, when she had 
taken him to the Tower. It had been a terrible question 
with her, when once she made up her mind, what she 
should tell him about the nature of their errand. She deter- 
mined to tell him as little as possible, to say only that she 
was going to see a poor woman who was in prison on 
account of a crime she had committed years before, and 
who had sent for her, and caused her to be told at the same 



 

time that if there was any child she could see as children 
(if they were good) were bright and cheering it would 
make her very happy that such a little visitor should come 
as well. It was very difficult, with Hyacinth, to make 
reservations or mysteries ; he wanted to know everything 
about everything, and he projected the light of a hundred 
questions upon Miss Pynsent's incarcerated friend. She 
had to admit that she had been her friend (for where else 
was the obligation to go to see her ?) ; but she spoke of the 
acquaintance as if it were of the slightest (it had survived 
in the memory of the prisoner only because every one else 
the world was so very hard ! had turned away from her), 
and she congratulated herself on a happy inspiration when 
she represented the crime for which such a penalty had 
been exacted as the theft of a gold watch, in a moment of 
irresistible temptation. The woman had had a wicked 
husband, who maltreated and deserted her, and she was 
very poor, almost starving, dreadfully pressed. Hyacinth 
listened to her history with absorbed attention, and then he 
said : 

' And hadn't she any children hadn't she a little boy ?' 
This inquiry seemed to Miss Pynsent a portent of future 
embarrassments, but she met it as bravely as she could, and 
replied that she believed the wretched victim of the law 
had had (once upon a time) a very small baby, but she was 
afraid she had completely lost sight of it. He must know 
they didn't allow babies in prisons. To this Hyacinth 
rejoined that of course they would allow him, because he 
was really big. Miss Pynsent fortified herself with the 
memory of her other pilgrimage, to Newgate, upwards of ten 
years before ; she had escaped from that ordeal, and had 





even had the comfort of knowing that in its fruits the inter- 
view had been beneficent. The responsibility, however, 
was much greater now, and, after all, it was not on her own 
account she was in a nervous tremor, but on that of the 
urchin over whom the shadow of the house of shame might 
cast itself. 

They made the last part of their approach on foot, hav- 
ing got themselves deposited as near as possible to the 
river and keeping beside it (according to advice elicited by 
Miss Pynsent, on the way, in a dozen confidential inter- 
views with policemen, conductors of omnibuses, and small 
shopkeepers), till they came to a big, dark building with 
towers, which they would know as soon as they looked at 
it. They knew it, in fact, soon enough, when they saw it 
lift its dusky mass from the bank of the Thames, lying 
there and sprawling over the whole, neighbourhood, with 
brown, bare, windowless walls, ugly, truncated pinnacles, 
and a character unspeakably sad and stern. It looked very 
sinister and wicked, to Miss Pynsent's eyes, and she won- 
dered why a prison should have such an evil face if it was 
erected in the, interest of justice and order an expression 
of the righteous forces of society. This particular peniten- 
tiary struck her as about as bad and wrong as those who 
were in it ; it threw a blight over the whole place and made 
the river look foul and poisonous, and the opposite bank, 
with its protrusion of long-necked chimneys, unsightly gaso- 
meters and deposits of rubbish, wear the aspect of a region 
at whose expense the jail had been populated. She looked 
up at the dull, closed gates, tightening her grasp of Hya- 
cinth's small hand ; and if it was hard to believe anything 
so blind and deaf and closely fastened would relax itself to 




let her in, there was a dreadful premonitory sinking of the 
heart attached to the idea of its taking the same trouble to 
let her out. As she hung back, murmuring vague ejacula- 
tions, at the very goal of her journey, an incident occurred 
which fanned all her scruples and reluctances into life again. 
The child suddenly jerked his hand out of her own, and 
placing it behind him, in the clutch of the other, said to 
her respectfully but resolutely, while he planted himself at 
a considerable distance 

' I don't like this place.' 

' Neither do I like it, my darling,' cried the dressmaker, 
pitifully. ' Oh, if you knew how little ! ' 

' Then we will go away. I won't go in.' 

She would have embraced this proposition with alacrity 
if it had not become very vivid to her while she stood there, 
in the midst of her shrinking, that behind those sullen walls
