had felt the need of afflicting him. " I don't say but 
what it can be made to come out all right in the end. 
All I say is, I don't see my way clear yet." 
" What makes you think he likes Pen ?" he asked 
quietly. 
" He told her so last night, and she told me this 
morning. Was he at the office to-day ?" 
 
" Yes, he was there. I haven't been there much 
myself. He didn't say anything to me. Does Irene 
know ?" 
" No ; I left her getting ready to go out shopping. 
She wants to get a pin like the one Nanny Corey 
had on." 
" my Lord !" groaned Lapham. 
" It 's been Pen from the start, I guess, or almost 
from the start. I don't say but what he was 
attracted some by Irene at the very first ; but I 
guess it 's been Pen ever since he saw her ; and 
we Ve taken up with a notion, and blinded ourselves 
with it. Time and again I've had my doubts 
whether he cared for Irene any ; but I declare to 
goodness, when he kept coming, I never hardly 
thought of Pen, and I couldn't help believing at 
last he did care for Irene. Did it ever strike you 
he might be after Pen ? " 
" No. I took what you said. I supposed you 
knew." 
" Do you blame me, Silas ?" she asked timidly. 
"No. What's the use of blaming? We don't 
either of us want anything but the children's good. 
What 's it all of it for, if it ain't for that ? That 's 
what we Ve both slaved for all our lives." 
"Yes, I know. Plenty of people lose their 
children," she' suggested. 
' ' Yes, but that don't comfort me any. I never 
was one to feel good because another man felt bad. 
How would you have liked it if some one had taken 
comfort because his boy lived when ours died ? 
 
No, I can't do it. And this is worse than death, 
someways. That comes and it goes ; but this looks 
as if it was one of those things that had come to 
stay. The way I look at it, there ain't any hope for 
anybody. Suppose we don't want Pen to have him ; 
will that help Irene any, if he don't want her ? 
Suppose we don't want to let him have either ; does 
that help either ! " 
" You talk," exclaimed Mrs. Lapham, " as if our 
say was going to settle it. Do you suppose that 
Penelope Lapham is a girl to take up witli a fellow 
that her sister is in love with, and that she always 
thought was in love with her sister, and go off and 
be happy with him ? Don't you believe but what it 
would come back to her, as long as she breathed the 
breath of life, how she 'd teased her about him, as 
I Ve heard Pen tease Irene, and helped to make her 
think he was in love with her, by showing that she 
thought so herself ? It 's ridiculous ! " 
Lapham seemed quite beaten down by this argu 
ment. His huge head hung forward over his breast ; 
the reins lay loose in his moveless hand ; the mare 
took her own way. At last he lifted his face and 
shut his heavy jaws. 
" Well ?" quavered his wife. 
" Well," he answered, " if he wants her, and she 
wants him, I don't see what that 's got to do with it." 
He looked straight forward, and not at his wife. 
She laid her hands on the reins. " Now, you stop 
right here, Silas Lapham ! If I thought that if I 
really believed you could be willing to break that 
 
poor child's heart, and let Pen disgrace herself by 
marrying a man that had as good as killed her sister, 
just because you wanted Bromfield Corey's son for 
a son-in-law " 
Lapham turned his face now, and gave her a look. 
" You had better not believe that, Persis ! Get 
up ! " he called to the mare, without glancing at her, 
and she sprang forward. " I see you Ve got past 
being any use to yourself on this subject." 
" Hello !" shouted a voice in front of him. " Where 
the devil you goin' to ? " 
" Do you want to Ml somebody ? " shrieked his 
wife. 
There was a light crash, and the mare recoiled her 
length, and separated their wheels from those of the 
open buggy in front which Lapham had driven into. 
He made his excuses to the occupant; and the 
accident relieved the tension of their feelings, and 
left them far from the point of mutual injury which 
they had reached in their common trouble and their 
unselfish will for their children's good. 
It was Lapham who resumed the talk. " I 'm 
afraid we can't either of us see this thing in the 
right light. We 're too near to it. I wish to the 
Lord there was somebody to talk to about it." 
"Yes," said his wife ; " but there ain't anybody." 
"Well, I dunno," suggested Lapham, after a 
moment; "why not talk to the minister of your 
church ? May be he could see some way out of it." 
Mrs. Lapham shook her head hopelessly. " It 
wouldn't do. I've never taken up my connection 
 
with the church, and I don't feel as if I 'd got any 
claim on him." 
" If he 's anything of a man, or anything of a 
preacher, you have got a claim on him," urged Lap- 
ham ; and he spoiled his argument by adding, " I 've 
contributed enough money to his church." 
" Oh, that 's nothing," said Mrs. Lapham. " I 
ain't well enough acquainted with Dr. Langworthy, 
or else I 'm too well. No ; if I was to ask any one, 
I should want to ask a total stranger. But what 's 
the use, Si ? Nobody could make us see it any dif 
ferent from what it is, and I don't know as I should 
want they should." 
It blotted out the tender beauty of the day, and 
weighed down their hearts ever more heavily within 
them. They ceased to talk of it a hundred times, 
and still came back to it. They drove on and on. 
It began to be late. " I guess we better go back, Si," 
said his wife ; and as he turned without speaking, 
she pulled her veil down and began to cry softly 
behind it, with low little broken sobs. 
Lapham started the mare up and drove swiftly 
homeward. At last his wife stopped crying and 
began trying to find her pocket. " Here, take mine, 
Persis," he said kindly, offering her his handkerchief, 
and she took it and dried her eyes with it. " There 
was one of those fellows there the other night," he 
spoke again, when his wife leaned back against the 
cushions in peaceful despair, " that I liked the looks 
of about as well as any man I ever saw. I guess he 
was a pretty good man. It was that Mr. Sewell." 
 
He looked at his wife, but she did not say anything. 
" Persis," he resumed, " I can't bear to go back with 
nothing settled in our minds. I can't bear to let 
you." 
"We must, Si," returned his wife, with gentle 
gratitude. Lapham groaned. " Where does he 
live ? " she asked. 
" On Bolingbroke Street. He gave me his 
number." 
" Well, it wouldn't do any good. What could he 
say to us ? " 
" Oh, I don't know as he could say anything," said 
Lapham hopelessly ; and neither of them said' any 
thing more till they crossed the Milldam and found 
themselves between the rows of city houses." 
"Don't drive past the new house, Si," pleaded his 
wife. " I couldn't bear to see it. Drive drive up 
Bolingbroke Street. We might as well see where 
he does live." 
" Well," said Lapham. He drove along slowly. 
" That 's the place," he said finally, stopping the 
mare and pointing with his whip. 
" It wouldn't do any good," said his wife, in a 
tone which he understood as well as he understood 
her words. He turned the mare up to the curb 
stone. 
" You take the reins a minute," he said, handing 
them to his wife. 
He got down and rang the bell, and waited till 
the door opened ; then he came back and lifted his 
wife out. " He 's in," he said. 
 
He got the hitch ing- weight from under the buggy- 
seat and made it fast to the mare's bit. 
"Do you think she'll stand with that?" asked 
Mrs. Lapham. 
" I guess so. If she don't, no matter." 
" Ain't you afraid she 'll take cold," she persisted, 
trying to make delay. 
" Let her ! " said Lapham. He took his wife's 
trembling hand under his arm, and drew her to the 
door. 
" He 'll think we 're crazy," she murmured in her 
broken pride. 
" Well, we are" said Lapham. " Tell him we 'd 
like to see him alone a while," he said to the girl 
who was holding the door ajar for him, and she 
showed him into the reception-room, which had 
been the Protestant confessional for many burdened 
souls before their time, coming, as they did, with the 
belief that they were bowed down with the only 
misery like theirs in the universe ; for each one of 
us must suffer long to himself before he can learn 
that he is but one in a great community of wretched 
ness which has been pitilessly repeating itself from 
the foundation of the world. 
They were as loath to touch their trouble when 
the minister came in as if it were their disgrace ; 
but Lapham did so at last, and, with a simple 
dignity which he had wanted in his bungling and 
apologetic approaches, he laid the affair clearly be 
fore the minister's compassionate and reverent eye.- 
He spared Corey's name, but he did not pretend that 
 
it was not himself and his wife and their daughters 
who were concerned. 
" I don't know as I Ve got any right to trouble 
you with this thing," he said, in the moment while 
Sewell sat pondering the case, " and I don't know as 
I Ve got any warrant for doing it. But, as I told 
my wife here, there was something about you I 
don't know whether it was anything you said 
exactly that made me feel as if you could help us. 
I guess I didn't say so much as that to her; but 
that 's the way I felt. And here we are. And if 
it ain't all right " 
" Surely," said Sewell, " it 's all right. I thank 
you for coming for trusting your trouble to ine. 
A time comes to every one of us when we can't help 
ourselves, and then we must get others to help us. 
If people turn to me at such a time, I feel sure that 
I was put into the world for something if nothing 
more than to give my pity, my sympathy." 
The brotherly words, so plain, so sincere, had a 
welcome in them that these poor outcasts of sorrow 
could not doubt. 
"Yes," said Lapham huskily, and his wife began 
to wipe the tears again under her veil. 
Sewell remained silent, and they waited till he 
should speak. " We can be of use to one another 
here, because we can always be wiser for some one 
else than we can for ourselves. We can see 
another's sins and errors in a more merciful light 
. and that is always a fairer light than we can 
our own ; and we can look more sanely at others' 
 
afflictions." He had addressed these words to 
Lapham ; now he turned to his wife. " If some 
one had come to you, Mrs. Lapham, in just this 
perplexity, what would you have thought ? " 
" I don't know as I understand you," faltered 
Mrs. Lapham. 
Sewell repeated his words, and added, " I mean, 
what do you think some one else ought to do in 
your place ? " 
" Was there ever any poor creatures in such a 
strait before ? " she asked, with pathetic incredulity. 
" There 's no new trouble under the sun," said 
the minister. 
" Oh, if it was any one else, I should say I 
should say Why, of course ! I should say that 
their duty was to let " She paused. 
" One suffer instead of three, if none is to blame ?" 
suggested Sewell. " That 's sense, and that 's justice. 
It 's the economy of pain which naturally suggests 
itself, and which would insist upon itself, if we were 
not all perverted by traditions which are the figment 
of the shallowest sentimentality. Tell me, Mrs. 
Lapham, didn't this come into your mind when you 
first learned how matters stood ? " 
"Why, yes, it flashed across me. But I didn't 
think it could be right." 
" And how was it with you, Mr. Lapham ? " 
" Why, 'that 's what I thought, of course. But I 
didn't see my way " 
" No," cried the minister, " we are all blinded, we. 
are all weakened by "a false ideal of self-sacrifice. It 
 
wraps us round with its meshes, and we can't fight 
our way out of it. Mrs. Lapham, what made you 
feel that it might be better for three to suffer than 
one f ' 
"Why, she did herself. I know she would die 
sooner than take him away from her." 
" I supposed so ! " cried the minister bitterly. 
" And yet she is a sensible girl, your daughter ?" 
" She has more common-sense " 
" Of course ! But in such a case we somehow 
think it must be wrong to use our common-sense. 
I don't know where this false ideal comes from, 
unless it comes from the novels that befool and 
debauch almost every intelligence in some degree. 
It certainly doesn't come from Christianity, which 
instantly repudiates it when confronted with it. 
Your daughter believes, in spite of her common- 
sense, that she ought to make herself and the man 
who loves her unhappy, in order to assure the life 
long wretchedness of her sister, whom he doesn't 
love, simply because her sister saw him and fancied 
him first ! And I 'm sorry to say that ninety-nine 
young people out of a hundred oh, nine hundred 
and ninety-nine out of a thousand ! would consider 
that noble and beautiful and heroic ; whereas you 
know at the bottom of your hearts that it would be 
foolish and cruel and revolting. You know what 
marriage is ! And what it must be without love on 
both sides." 
The minister had grown quite heated and red in 
the face. 
 SILAS LAPHAM. 
" I lose all patience !" he went on vehemently. 
" This poor child of yours has somehow been brought 
to believe that it will kill her sister if her sister does 
not have what does not belong to her, and what it 
is not in the power of all the world, or any soul in 
the world, to give her. Her sister will suffer yes, 
keenly ! in heart and in pride ; but she will not die. 
You will suffer too, in your tenderness for her ; but 
you must do your duty. You must help her to give 
up. You would be guilty if you did less. Keep 
clearly in mind that you are doing right, and the 
only possible good. And God be with you !" 
XIX. 
" HE talked sense, Persis," said Lapham gently, as 
he mounted to his wife's side in the buggy and drove 
slowly homeward through the dusk. 
"Yes, he talked sense," she admitted. But she 
added bitterly, " I guess, if he had it to do ! Oh, 
he 's right, and it 's got to be done. There ain't any 
other way for it. It 's sense ; and, yes, it 's justice." 
They walked to their door after they left the horse 
at the livery stable around the corner, where Lapham 
kept it. " I want you should send Irene up to our 
room as soon as we get in, Silas." 
"Why, ain't you going to have any supper first ?" 
faltered Lapham with his latch-key in the lock. 
"No. I can't lose a minute. If I do, I shan't do 
it at all." 
" Look here, Persis," said her husband tenderly, 
"let rtw do this thing." 
"Oh, you!" said his wife, with a woman's com 
passionate scorn for a man's helplessness in such a 
case. " Send her right up. And I shall feel 
She stopped to spare him. 
Then she opened the door, and ran up to her 
room without waiting to speak to Irene, who had 
come into the hall at the sound of her father's key 
in the door. 
" I guess your mother wants to see you upstairs," 
said Lapham, looking away. 
Her mother turned round and faced the girl's 
wondering look as Irene entered the chamber, so 
close upon her that she had not yet had time to lay 
off her bonnet ; she stood with her wraps still on 
her arm. 
" Irene ! " she said harshly, " there is something 
you have got to bear. It 's a mistake we 've all 
made. He don't care anything for you. He never 
did. He told Pen so last night. He cares for her." 
The sentences had fallen like blows. But the girl 
had taken them without flinching. She stood up 
immovable, but the delicate rose-liglit of her com 
plexion went out and left her colourless. She did 
not offer to speak. 
" Why don't you say something ? " cried her 
mother. " Do you want to kill me, Irene ? " 
" Why should I want to hurt you, mamma ? " the 
girl replied steadily, but in an alien voice. " There's 
nothing to say. I want to see Pen a minute.' 
She turned and left the room. As she mounted 
the stairs that led to her own and her sister's rooms 
on the floor above, her mother helplessly followed. 
Irene went first to her own room at the front of the 
house, and then came out leaving the door open and 
the gas flaring behind her. The mother could see 
that she had tumbled many things out of the drawers 
of her bureau upon the marble top. 
 
She passed her mother, where she stood in the 
entry. " You can come too, if you want to, 
mamma," she said. 
She opened Penelope's door without knocking, 
and went in. Penelope sat at the window, as in the 
morning. Irene did not go to her ; but she went 
and laid a gold hair-pin on her bureau, and said, 
without looking at her, " There 's a pin that I got 
to-day, because it was like his sister's. It won't be 
come a dark person so well, but you can have it." 
She stuck a scrap of paper in the side of Pene 
lope's mirror. " There 's that account of Mr. 
Stanton's ranch. You 'll want to read it, I pre 
sume." 
She laid a withered boutonnikre on the bureau 
beside the pin. " There 's his button-hole bouquet. 
He left it by his plate, and I stole it" 
She had a pine-shaving fantastically tied up with 
a knot of ribbon, in her hand. She held it a 
moment; then, looking deliberately at Penelope, 
she went up to her, and dropped it in her lap with 
out a word. She turned, and, advancing a few steps, 
tottered and seemed about to fall. 
Her mother sprang forward with an imploring 
cry, " 'Rene, 'Rene, 'Rene ! " 
Irene recovered herself before her mother could 
reach her. "Don't touch me," she said icily. 
" Mamma, I 'm going to put on my things. I want 
papa to walk with me. I 'm choking here." 
" I I can't let you go out, Irene, child," began 
her mother. 
 
" You 've got to," replied the girl. " Tell papa to 
hurry his supper." 
" poor soul ! He doesn't want any supper. 
lie knows it too." 
" I don't want to talk about that Tell him to 
get ready." 
She left them once more. 
Mrs. Lapham turned a hapless glance upon Pene 
lope. 
"Go and tell him, mother," said the girl. "I 
would, if I could. If she can walk, let her. It 's 
the only thing for her." She sat still ; she did not 
even brush to the floor the fantastic thing that lay 
in her lap, and that sent up faintly the odour of the 
sachet powder with which Irene liked to perfume 
her boxes. 
Lapham went out with the unhappy child, and 
began to talk with her, crazily, incoherently, enough. 
She mercifully stopped him. "Don't talk, papa. 
I don't want any one should talk with me." 
He obeyed, and they walked silently on and on. 
In their aimless course they reached the new house 
on the water side of Beacon, and she made him stop, 
and stood looking up at it. The scaffolding which 
had so long defaced the front was gone, and in the 
light of the gas-lamp before it all the architectural 
beauty of the facade was suggested, and much of 
the finely felt detail was revealed. Seymour had 
pretty nearly satisfied himself in that rich facade ; 
certainly Lapham had not stinted him of the 
means. 
 
"Well," said the girl, "I shall never live in it," 
and she began to walk on. 
Lapham's sore heart went down, as he lumbered 
heavily after her. " Oh yes, you will, Irene. You 'll 
have lots of good times there yet." 
" No," she answered, and said nothing more about 
it. They had not talked of their trouble at all, and 
they did not speak of it now. Lapham understood 
that she was trying to walk herself weary, and he 
was glad to hold his peace and let her have her way. 
She halted him once more before the red and yellow 
lights of an apothecary's window. 
"Isn't there something they give you to make 
you sleep *? " she asked vaguely. " I 've got to sleep 
to-night ! " 
Lapham trembled. "I guess you don't want 
anything, Irene." 
" Yes, I do ! Get me something ! " she retorted 
wilfully. "If you don't, I shall die. I must sleep." 
They went in, and Lapham asked for something 
to make a nervous person sleep. Irene stood poring 
over the show-case full of brushes and trinkets, 
while the apothecary put up the bromide, which he 
guessed would be about the best thing. She did 
not show any emotion ; her face was like a stone, 
while her father's expressed the anguish of his 
sympathy. He looked as if he had not slept for a 
week ; his fat eyelids drooped over his glassy eyes, 
and his cheeks and throat hung flaccid. He started 
as the apothecary's cat stole smoothly up and rubbed 
itself against his leg : and it was to him that the man 
 
said, " You want to take a table-spoonful of that as 
long as you 're awake. I guess it won't take a great 
many to fetch you." 
"All right," said Lapham, and paid and went out. 
" I don't know but I shall want some of it," he said, 
with a joyless laugh. 
Irene came closer up to him and took his arm. 
He laid his heavy paw on her gloved fingers. After 
a while she said, " I want you should let me go up 
to Lapham to-morrow." 
" To Lapham ? Why, to-morrow 's Sunday, Irene I 
You can't go to-morrow." 
"Well, Monday, then. I can live through one 
day here." 
" Well," said the father passively. He made no 
pretence of asking her why she wished to go, nor 
any attempt to dissuade her. 
" Give me that bottle," she said, when he opened 
the door at home for her, and she ran up to her own 
room. 
The next morning Irene came to breakfast with 
her mother ; the Colonel and Penelope did not 
appear, and Mrs. Lapham looked sleep-broken and 
careworn. 
The girl glanced at her. " Don't you fret about 
me, mamma," she said. " I shall get along." She 
seemed herself as steady and strong as rock. 
" I don't like to see you keeping up so, Irene,'' 
replied her mother. " It 'll be all the worse for you 
when you do break. Better give way a little at the 
start." 
 
" I shan't break, and I 've given way all I 'm 
going to. I 'm going to Lapham to-morrow, I 
want you should go with me, mamma,- and I guess 
I can keep up one day here. All about it is, I don't 
want you should say anything, or look anything. 
And, whatever I do, I don't want you should try to 
stop me. And, the first thing, I 'm going to take 
her breakfast up to her. Don't ! " she cried, inter 
cepting the protest on her mother's lips. " I shall 
not let it hurt Pen, if I can help it. She 's never 
done a thing nor thought a thing to wrong me. I 
had to fly out at her last night ; but that 's all over 
now, and I know just what I Ve got to bear." 
She had her way unmolested. She carried Pene 
lope's breakfast to her, and omitted no care or 
attention that could make the sacrifice complete, 
with an heroic pretence that she was performing no 
unusual service. They did not speak, beyond her 
saying, in a clear dry note, " Here 's your breakfast, 
Pen," and her sister 's answering, hoarsely and tremu 
lously, " Oh, thank you, Irene." And, though two 
or three times they turned their faces toward each 
other while Irene remained in the room, mechani 
cally putting its confusion to rights, their eyes did 
not meet. Then Irene descended upon the other 
rooms, which she set in order, and some of which 
she fiercely swept and dusted. She made the 
beds ; and she sent the two servants away to church 
as soon as they had eaten their breakfast, telling 
them that she would wash their dishes. Through 
out the morning her father and mother heard her 
 
about the work of getting dinner, with certain 
silences which represented the moments when she 
stopped and stood stock-still, and then, readjusting 
her burden, forced herself forward under it again. 
They sat alone in the family room, out of which 
their two girls seemed to have died. Lapham could 
not read his Sunday papers, and she had no heart to 
go to church, as she would have done earlier in life 
when in trouble. Just then she was obscurely feel 
ing that the church was somehow to blame for that 
counsel of Mr. Se well's on which they had acted. 
" I should like to know," she said, having brought 
the matter up, " whether he would have thought 
it was such a light matter if it had been his own 
children. Do you suppose he 'd have been so ready 
to act on his own advice if it had been ? " 
" He told us the right thing to do, Persis, the 
only thing. We couldn't let it go on," urged her 
husband gently. 
" Well, it makes me despise Pen ! Irene 's show 
ing twice the character that she is, this very minute." 
The mother said this so that the father might 
defend her daughter to her. He did not fail. 
" Irene 's got the easiest part, the way I look at it. 
And you'll see that Pen 'll know how to behave 
when the time comes." 
"What do you want she should do ?" 
" I haven't got so far as that yet. What arc we 
going to do about Irene ?" 
" What do you want Pen should do," repeated 
Mrs. Lapham, " when it comes to it ? " 
 
"Well, I don't want she should take him, for one 
thing," said Lapliam. 
This seemed to satisfy Mrs. Lapliam as to her 
husband, and she said in defence of Corey, "Why, 
I don't see what he 's clone. It 's all been our doing." 
" Never mind that now. What about Irene ? " 
" She says she 's going to Lapham to-morrow. 
She feels that she 's got to get away somewhere. 
It's natural she should." 
"Yes, and I presume it will be about the best 
thing far her. Shall you go with her ? " 
" Yes." 
"Well." He comfortlessly took up a newspaper 
again, and she rose with a sigh, and went to her 
room to pack some things for the morrow's journey. 
After dinner, when Irene had cleared away the 
last trace of it in kitchen and dining-room with 
unsparing punctilio, she came downstairs, dressed 
to go out, and bade her father come to walk with 
her again. It was a repetition of the aimlessness of 
the last night's wanderings. They came back, and 
she got tea for them, and after that they heard her 
stirring about in her own room, as if she were busy 
about many things ; but they did not dare to look in 
upon her, even after all the noises had ceased, and 
they knew she had gone to bed. 
" Yes ; it 's a thing she 's got to fight out by her 
self," said Mrs Lapham. 
"I guess she'll get along," said Lapham. "But 
I don't want you should misjudge Pen either. 
She 's all right too. She ain't to blame." 
 
" Yes, I know. But I can't work round to it all 
at once. I shan't misjudge her, but you can't expect 
me to get over it right away." 
"Mamma," said Irene, when she was hurrying 
their departure the next morning, " what did she 
tell him when he asked her ?" 
"Tell him?" echoed the mother; and after a 
while she added, "She didn't tell him anything." 
" Did she say anything about me ? " 
" She said he mustn't come here any more." 
Irene turned and went into her sister's room. 
" Good-bye, Pen," she said, kissing her with an 
effect of not seeing or touching her. " I want you 
should tell him all about it If he 'a half a man, he 
won't give up till he knows why you won't have 
him ; and he has a right to know." 
"It wouldn't make any difference. I couldn't 
have him after " 
"That's for you to say. But if you don't tell 
him about me, I will." 
" 'Rene ! " 
"Yes! You needn't say I cared for him. But you 
can say that you all thought he cared for me." 
" Irene 
" Don't ! " Irene escaped from the arms that tried 
to cast themselves about her. " You are all right, 
Pen. You haven't done anything. You Ve helped 
me all you could. But I can't yet." 
She went out of the room and summoned Mrs. 
Lapham with a sharp "Now, mamma!" and went 
on putting the last things into her trunks. 
 
The Colonel went to the station with them, and 
put them on the train. He got them a little com 
partment to themselves in the Pullman car ; and as 
he stood leaning with his lifted hands against the 
sides of the doorway, he tried to say something con 
soling and hopeful : " I guess you 'll have an easy 
ride, Irene. I don't believe it 'll be dusty, any, after 
the rain last night." 
"Don't you stay till the train starts, papa," re 
turned the girl, in rigid rejection of his futilities. 
" Get off, now." 
" Well, if you want I should," he said, glad to be 
able to please her in anything. He remained on the 
platform till the cars started. He saw Irene bustling 
about in the compartment, making her mother com 
fortable for the journey ; but Mrs. Lapham did not 
lift her head. The train moved off, and he went 
heavily back to his business. 
From time to time during the day, when he caught 
a glimpse of him, Corey tried to make out from his 
face whether he knew what had taken place between 
him and Penelope. When Rogers came in about 
time of closing, and shut himself up with Lapham 
in his room, the young man remained till the two 
came out together and parted in their salutationless 
fashion. 
Lapham showed no surprise at seeing Corey still 
there, and merely answered, " Well ! " when the 
young man said that he wished to speak with him, 
and led the way back to his room. 
Corey shut the door behind them. "I only 
 
wish to speak to you in case you know of the 
matter already ; for otherwise I 'm bound by a pro 
mise." 
"I guess I know what you mean. It's about 
Penelope." 
" Yes, it 's about Miss Lapham. I am greatly 
attached to her you 'll excuse my saying it ; I 
couldn't excuse myself if I were not." 
"Perfectly excusable," said Lapham. "It's all 
right" 
" Oh, I 'm glad to hear you say that ! " cried the 
young fellow joyfully. " I want you to believe that 
this isn't a new thing or an unconsidered thing with 
me though it seemed so unexpected to her." 
Lapham fetched a deep sigh. "It's all right 
as far as I 'm concerned or her mother. We 've 
both liked you first-rate." 
"Yes?" 
. " But there seems to be something in Penelope's 
mind I don't know " The Colonel consciously 
dropped his eyes. 
" She referred to something I couldn't make out 
what but I hoped I hoped that with your leave 
I might overcome it the barrier whatever it was. 
Miss Lapham Penelope gave me the hope that 
I was wasn't indifferent to her " 
" Yes, I guess that 's so," said Lapham. He 
suddenly lifted his head, and confronted the young 
fellow's honest face with his own face, so different 
in its honesty. " Sure you never made up to any 
one else at the same time ? " 
 
" Never ! Who could imagine such a thing ? If 
that 's all, I can easily - " 
" I don't say that 's all, nor that that's it. I don't 
want you should go upon that idea. I just thought, 
may be you hadn't thought of it." 
" No, I certainly hadn't thought of it ! Such a 
thing would have been so impossible to me that I 
couldn't have thought of it ; and it 's so shocking to 
mo now that I don't know what to say to it." 
" "Well, don't take it too much to heart," said 
Lapham, alarmed at the feeling he had excited ; " I 
don't say she thought so. I was trying to guess 
trying to - " 
" If there is anything I can say or do to convince 
" Oh, it ain't necessary to say anything. I 'm all 
right." 
"But Miss Lapham ! I may see her again? I 
may try to convince her that - " 
He stopped in distress, and Lapham afterwards 
told his wife that he kept seeing the face of Irene as 
it looked when he parted with her in the car ; and 
whenever he was going to say yes, he could not open 
his lips. At the same time he could not help feel 
ing that Penelope had a right to what was her own, 
and Sewell's words came back to him. Besides, 
they had already put Irene to the worst suffering. 
Lapham compromised, as he imagined. 
" You can come round to-night and see me, if you 
want to," he said ; and he bore grimly the gratitude 
that the young man poured out upon him.

Penelope came down to supper and took her 
mother's place at the head of the table. 
Lapham sat silent in her presence as long as he 
could bear it. Then he asked, " How do you feel 
to-night, Pen ? " 
" Oh, like a thief," said the girl. " A thief that 
hasn't been arrested yet." 
Lapham waited a while "before he said, " Well, 
now, your mother and I want you should hold up 
on that a while." 
" It isn't for you to say. It 's something I can't 
hold up on." 
" Yes, I guess you can. If I know what 's hap 
pened, then what 's happened is a thing that nobody 
is to blame for. And we want you should make the 
best of it and not the worst. Heigh ? It ain't 
going to help Irene any for you to hurt yourself or 
anybody else ; and I don't want you should take up 
with any such crazy notion. As far as heard from, 
you haven't stolen anything, and whatever you've 
got belongs to you." 
" Has he been speaking to you, father ? " 
"Your mother's been speaking to me." 
" Has he been speaking to you ?" 
" That's neither here nor there." 
" Then he 's broken his word, and I will never 
speak to him again ! " 
" If he was any such fool as to promise that he 
wouldn't talk to me on a subject " Lapham drew a 
deep breath, and then made the plunge " that I 
brought up " 
 
" Did you bring it up ? " 
" The same as brought up the quicker he broke 
his word the better; and I want you should act 
upon that idea. Kecollect that it's my business, 
and your mother's business, as well as yours, and 
we 're going to have our say. He hain't done any 
thing wrong, Pen, nor anything that he 's going to 
be punished for. Understand that. He 's got to 
have a reason, if you're not going to have him. I 
don't say you Ve got to have him ; I want you 
should feel perfectly free about that ; but I do say 
you Ve got to give him a reason." 
" Is he coming here ? " 
" I don't know as you 'd call it coming " 
" Yes, you do, father ! " said the girl, in forlorn 
amusement at his shuffling. 
" He 's coming here to see me " 
" When 's he coming ? " 
" I don't know but he's coming to-night." 
" And you want I should see him ? " 
" I don't know but you 'd better." 
" All right. I 'll see him." 
Lapham drew a long deep breath of suspicion in 
spired by this acquiescence. " What you going to 
do ? " he asked presently. 
" I don't know yet," answered the girl sadly. " It 
depends a good deal upon what he does." 
" Well," said Lapham, with the hungriness of un 
satisfied anxiety in his tone. When Corey's card 
was brought into the family-room where he and 
Penelope were sitting, he went into the parlour to 
 
find him. " I guess Penelope wants to see you," he 
said; and, indicating the family-room, he added, 
" She 's in there," and did not go back himself. 
Corey made his way to the girl's presence with 
open trepidation, which was not allayed by her 
silence and languor. She sat in the chair where she 
had sat the other night, but she was not playing 
with a fan now. 
He came toward her, and then stood faltering. 
A faint smile quivered over her face at the spectacle 
of his subjection. " Sit down, Mr. Corey," she said. 
" There 's no reason why we shouldn't talk it over 
quietly ; for I know you will think I 'm right." 
" I 'm sure of that," he answered hopefully. 
" When I saw that your father knew of it to-day, I 
asked him to let me see you again. I 'm afraid that 
I broke my promise to you technically " 
" It had to be broken." 
He took more courage at her words. " But I 've 
only come to do whatever you say, and not to be an 
annoyance to you " 
" Yes, you have to know ; but I couldn't tell you 
before. Now they all think I should." 
A tremor of anxiety passed over the young man's 
face, on which she kept her eyes steadily fixed. 
" We supposed it it was Irene " 
He remained blank a moment, and then he said 
with a smile of relief, of deprecation, of protest, of 
amazement, of compassion 
" Oh ! Never ! Never for an instant ! How 
could you think such a thing ? It was impossible ! 
I never thought of her. But I see I see ! I can ex 
plain no, there 's nothing to explain ! I have never 
knowingly done or said a thing from first to last to 
make you think that. I see how terrible it is ! " he 
said ; but he still smiled, as if he could not take it 
seriously. " I admired her beauty who could help 
doing that? and I thought her very good and 
sensible. Why, last winter in Texas, I told Stanton 
about our meeting in Canada, and we agreed I 
only tell you to show you how far I always was 
from what you thought that he must come North 
and try to see her, and and of course, it all 
sounds very silly ! and he sent her a newspaper 
with an account of his ranch in it " 
" She thought it came from you." 
" Oh, good heavens ! He didn't tell me till after 
he 'd done it. But he did it for a part of our foolish 
joke. And when I met your sister again, I only 
admired her as before. I can see, now, how I must 
have seemed to be seeking her out ; but it was to 
talk of you with her I never talked of anything 
else if I could help it, except when I changed the 
subject because I was ashamed to be always talking 
of you. I see how distressing it is for all of you. 
But tell me that you believe me ! " 
" Yes, I must. It 's all been our mistake " 
" It has indeed ! But there 's no mistake about 
my loving you, Penelope," he said ; and the old- 
fashioned name, at which she had often mocked, 
was sweet to her from his lips. 
" That only makes it worse ! " she answered. 
 
"Oh no!" he gently protested. "It makes it 
better. It makes it right. How is it worse ? How 
is it wrong ? " 
" Can't you see ? You must understand all now ! 
Don't you see that if she believed so too, and if 
she " She could not go on. 
"Did she did your sister think that too?" 
gasped Corey. 
" She used to talk with me about you ; and when 
you say you care for me now, it makes me feel like 
the vilest hypocrite in the world. That day you 
gave her the list of books, and she came down to 
Nantasket, and went on about you, I helped her to 
natter herself oh ! I don't see how she can forgive 
me. But she knows I can never forgive myself ! 
That 's the reason she can do it. I can see now," 
she went on, "how I must have been trying to get 
you from her. I can't endure it ! The only way is 
for me never to see you or speak to you again ! " 
She laughed forlornly. " That would be pretty hard 
on you, if you cared." 
" I do care all the world ! " 
" Well, then, it would if you were going to keep 
on caring. You won't long, if you stop coming now." 
" Is this all, then ? Is it the end ? " 
" It 's whatever it is. I can't get over the 
thought of her. Once I thought I could, but now I 
see that I can't. It seems to grow worse. Some 
times I feel as if it would drive me crazy." 
He sat looking at her with lack-lustre eyes. The 
light suddenly came back into them. "Do you 
 
think I could love you if you had been false to her ? 
I know you have been true to her, and truer still to 
yourself. I never tried to see her, except with the 
hope of seeing you too. I supposed she must know 
that I was in love with you. From the first time I 
saw you there that afternoon, you filled my fancy. 
Do you think I was flirting with the child, or no, 
you don't think that ! We have not done wrong. 
We have not harmed any one knowingly. We have 
a right to each other " 
" No ! no ! you must never speak to me of this 
again. If you do, I shall know that you despise 
me." 
" But how will that help her ? I don't love her." 
" Don't say that to me ! I have said that to my 
self too much." 
" If you forbid me to love you, it won't make me 
love her," he persisted. 
She was about to speak, but she caught her breath 
without doing so, and merely stared at him. 
" I must do what you say," he continued. " But 
what good will it do her? You can't make her 
happy by making yourself unhappy." 
" Do you ask me to profit by a wrong ? " 
" Not for the world. But there is no wrong ! "
