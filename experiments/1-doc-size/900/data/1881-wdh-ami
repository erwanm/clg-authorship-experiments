cally complained of this, he said : " I 'm very glad of 
that. Let 's try to be equal to the little sacrifices we 
must make for each other ; they will be quite enough. 
Many a woman who would be ready to die for her 




husband makes him wretched because she won 't live 
for him. Don 't despise the day of small things." 

" Yes, but when every day seems the day of small 
things ! " she pouted. 

" Every day is the day of small things," said Ather- 
ton, " with people who are happy. We 're never so 
prosperous as when we can 't remember what happened 
last Monday." 

" Oh, but I can 't bear to be always living in the 
present." 

" It 's not so spacious, I know, as either the past or 
the future, but it 's all we have." 

" There ! " cried Clara. " That 's fatalism ! It 's 
worse than fatalism ! " 

" And is fatalism so very bad ? " asked her hus 
band. 

" It 's Mahometanism ! " 

" Well, it isn 't necessarily a plurality of wives," 're 
turned Atherton, in subtle anticipation of her next 
point. " And it 's really only another name for resig 
nation, which is certainly a good thing." 

" Eesignation ? Oh, I don 't know about that  " 

Atherton laughed, and put his arm round her 
waist : an argument that no woman can answer in a 
man she loves ; it seems to deprive her of her reason 
ing faculties. In the atmosphere of affection which she 
breathed, she sometimes feared that her mental powers 
were really weakening. As a girl she had lived a life 
full of purposes, which, if somewhat vague, were un 
questionably large. She had then had great interests, 
art, music, literature, the symphony concerts, Mr. 
Hunt 's classes, the novels of George Eliot, and Mr. 
Fiske 's lectures on the cosmic philosophy ; and she 
had always felt that they expanded and elevated ex 
istence. In her moments of question as to the shape 
which her life had taken since, she tried to think 
whether the happiness which seemed so little depend- 



 

ent on these things was not beneath the demands of 
a spirit which was probably immortal and was cer 
tainly cultivated. They all continued to be part of 
her life, but only a very small part ; and she would 
have liked to ask her husband whether his influence 
upon her had been wholly beneficial. She was not 
sure that it had ; but neither was she sure that it had 
not. She had never fully consented to the distinct 
ness with which he classified all her emotions and 
ideas as those of a woman : in her heart she doubted 
whether a great many of them might not be those of 
a man, though she had never found any of them ex 
actly like his. She could not complain that he did 
not treat her as an equal ; he deferred to her, and de 
pended upon her good sense to an extent that some 
times alarmed her, for she secretly knew that she 
had a very large streak of silliness in her nature. 
He seemed to tell her everything, and to be greatly 
ruled by her advice, especially in matters of business ; 
but she could not help observing that he often kept 
matters involving certain moral questions from her 
till the moment for deciding them was past. When 
she accused him of this, he confessed that it was so ; 
but defended himself by saying that he was afraid her 
conscience might sway him against his judgment. 

Clara now recurred to these words of his as she sat 
looking at him through her tears across the breakfast 
table. " Was that the reason you never told me about 
poor Ben before ? " 

" Yes, and I expect you to justify me. What good 
would it have done to tell you ? " 

" I could have told you, at least, that, if Ben had 
any such feeling as that, it wasn 't his fault alto 
gether." 

" But you wouldn 't have believed that, Clara," said 
Atherton. " You know that, whatever that poor crea 
ture 's faults are, coquetry isn 't one of them." 



 

Clara only admitted the fact passively. "How did 
he excuse himself for coming back ? " she asked. 

" He didn 't excuse himself ; he defied himself. We 
had a stormy talk, and he ended by denying that he 
had any social duty in the matter." 

" And I think he was quite right ! " Clara flashed 
out. " It was his own affair." 

" He said he had a concrete purpose, and wouldn 't 
listen to abstractions. Yes, he talked like a woman. 
But you know he wasn 't right, Clara, though you talk 
like a woman, too. There are a great many things 
that are not wrong except as they wrong others. I 've 
no doubt that, as compared with the highest love her 
husband ever felt for her, Ben 's passion was as light 
to darkness. But * if he could only hope for its return 
through the perversion of her soul, through teaching 
her to think of escape from her marriage by a divorce, 
then it was a crime against her and against so 
ciety." 

" Ben couldn 't do such a thing ! " 

" No, he could only dream of doing it. When it 
came to the attempt, everything that was good in him 
revolted against it and conspired to make him help 
her in the efforts that would defeat his hopes if they 
succeeded. It was a ghastly ordeal, but it was sub 
lime ; and when the climax came, that paper, 
which he had only to conceal for a few days or weeks, 
he was equal to the demand upon him. But sup 
pose a man of his pure training and traditions had 
yielded to temptation, suppose he had so far de 
praved himself that he could have set about persuad 
ing her that she owed no allegiance to her husband, 
and might rightfully get a divorce and marry him, 
what a ruinous blow it would have been to all who 
knew of it ! It would have disheartened those who 
abhorred it, and encouraged those who wanted to 
profit by such an example. It doesn 't matter much, 



 

socially, what undisciplined people like Bartley and 
Marcia Hubbarcl do ; but if a man like Ben Halleck 
goes astray, it 's calamitous ; it confounds the human 
conscience as Victor Hugo says. All that careful 
nurture in the right since he could speak, all that life 
long decency of thought and act, that noble ideal of 
unselfishness and responsibility to others, trampled 
under foot and spit upon, it 's horrible ! " 

" Yes," answered Clara, deeply moved, even as a 
woman may be in a pretty breakt ast-rooin, " and such 
a good soul as Ben always was naturally. Will you 
have some more tea ? " 

" Yes, I will take another cup. But as for natural 
goodness " 

" Wait ! I will ring for some hot water." 

When the maid had appeared, disappeared, reap 
peared, and finally vanished, Athertou resumed. " The 
natural goo.lness doesn 't count. The natural man 
is a wild beast, and his natural goodness is the 
amiability of a beast basking in the sun when his 
stomach is full. The Hubbards were full of natural 
goodness, I dare say, when they didn 't happen to 
cross each other 's wishes. No, it 's the implanted good 
ness that saves, the seed of righteousness treasured 
from generation to generation, and carefully watched 
and tended by disciplined fathers and mothers in the 
hearts where they have dropped it. The flower of 
this implanted goodness is what we call civilization, 
the condition of general uprightness that Halleck 
declared he owed no allegiance to. But he was better 
than his word." 

Atherton lifted, with his slim, delicate hand, the 
cup of translucent china, and drained off the fragrant 
Souchong, sweetened, and tempered with Jersey cream 
to perfection. Something in the sight went like a 
pang to his wife 's heart. " Ah I " she said, " it is easy 
enough for us to condemn. We have everything we 
want ! " 



 

" I don 't forget that, Clara," said Athcrton, gravely. 
" Sometimes when I think of it, I am ready to renounce 
all judgment of others. The consciousness of our 
comfort, our luxury, almost paralyzes me at those 
times, and I am ashamed and afraid even of our hap 
piness." 

" Yes, what right," pursued Clara, rebelliously, 
" have we to be happy and united, and these wretched 
creatures so " 

" No right, none in the world ! But somehow the 
effects follow their causes. In some sort they chose 
misery for themselves, we make our own hell in 
this life and the next, or it was chosen for them by 
undisciplined wills that they inherited. In the long 
run their fate must be a just one." 

" Ah, but I have to look at things in the short run, 
and I can 't see any justice in Marcia 's husband using 
her so ! " cried Clara. " Why shouldn 't you use me 
badly ? I don 't believe that any woman ever meant 
better by her husband than she did." 

" Oh, the meaning doesn 't count ! It 's our deeds 
that judge us. He is a thoroughly bad fellow, but 
you may be sure she has been to blame. Though I 
don 't blame the Hubbards, either of them, so much as 
I blame Halleck. He not only had everything he 
wished, but the training to know what he ought to 
wish." 

" I don 't know about his having everything. I 
think Ben must have been disappointed, some time," 
said Clara, evasively. 

" Oh, that 's nothing," replied Atherton, with the 
contented husband 's indifference to sentimental griev 
ances. 

Clara did not speak for some moments, and then 
she summed up a turmoil of thoughts in a profound 
sigh. "Well, I don 't like it ! I thought it was bad 
enough having a man, even on the outskirts of my 



 

acquaintance, abandon his wife ; but now Ben Hal- 
leek, who has been like a brother to me, to have him 
mixed up in such an affair in the way he is, it 's in 
tolerable ! " 

" I agree with you," said Atherton, playing with 
his spoon. " You know how I hate anything that sins 
against order, and this whole thing is disorderly. It 's 
intolerable, as you say. But we must bear our 
share of it. We 're all bound together. No one 
sins or suffers to himself in a civilized state, or 
religious state ; it 's the same thing. Every link in 
the chain feels the effect of the violence, more or less 
intimately. We rise or fall together in Christian 
society. It 's strange that it should be so hard to 
realize a thing that every experience of life teaches. 
We keep on thinking of offences against the common 
good as if they were abstractions ! " 

" Well, one thing," said Clara, " I shall always think 
unnecessarily shocking and disgraceful about it. And 
that is Ben 's going out with her on this journey. I 
don 't see how you could allow that, Eustace." 

" Yes," said Atherton, after a thoughtful silence, " it 
is shocking. The only consolation is that it is not un 
necessarily shocking. I 'm afraid that it 's necessarily 
so. When any disease of soul or body has gone far 
enough, it makes its own conditions, and other things 
must adjust themselves to it. Besides, no one knows 
the ugliness of the situation but Halleck himself. I 
don 't see how I could have interfered ; and upon the 
whole I don 't know that I ought to have interfered, if 
I could. She would be helpless without him ; and he 
can get no harm from it. In fact, it 's part of his 
expiation, which must have begun as soon as he met 
her again after he came home." 

Clara was convinced, but not reconciled. She only 
said, "I don 't like it." 

Her husband did not reply; he continued mus- 



 

ingly : " When the old man made that final appeal to 
her jealousy, all that there is really left, probably, 
of her love for her husband, and she responded 
with a face as wicked as his, I couldn 't help looking 
at Halleck : 

" Oh, poor Ben ! How did he take it ? It must 
have scared, it must have disgusted him ! " 

" That 's what I had expected. But there was 
nothing in his face but pity. He understood, and he 
pitied her. That was all." 

Clara rose, and turned to the window, where she 
remained looking through her tears at the gulls on 
the shallow. It seemed much more than twenty-four 
hours since she had taken leave of Marcia and the rest at 
the station, and saw them set out on their long journey 
with its uncertain and unimaginable end. She had 
deeply sympathized with them all, but at the same 
time she had felt very keenly the potential scandalous 
ness of the situation ; she shuddered inwardly when 
she thought what if people knew ; she had always 're 
volted from contact with such social facts as their 
errand involved. She got Olive aside for a moment, 
and asked her, " Don 't you hate it, Olive ? Did you 
ever dream of being mixed up in such a thing ? I 
should die, simply die ! " 

" I shall not think of dying, unless we fail," an 
swered Olive. " And, as for hating it, I haven 't con 
sulted my feelings a great deal ; but I rather think I 
like it." 

" Like going out to be a witness in an Indiana di 
vorce case ! " 

" I don 't look at it in that way, Clara. It 's a cru 
sade to me ; it 's a holy war ; it 's the cause of an in 
nocent woman against a wicked oppression. I know 
how you would feel about it, Clara ; but I never ivas 
as respectable as you are, and I 'm quite satisfied to 
do what Ben, and father, and Mr. Atherton approve. 



 

They think it 's my duty, and I am glad to go, and to be 
of all the use I can. But you shall have my heartfelt 
sympathy through all, Clara, for your involuntary ac 
quaintance with our proceedings." 

" Olive ! You know that I 'm proud of your courage 
and Ben 's goodness, and that I fully appreciate the 
sacrifice you 're making. And I 'm not ashamed of 
your business : I think it 's grand and sublime, and I 
would just as soon scream it out at the top of my 
voice, right here in the Albany depot." 

" Don V said Olive. " It would frighten the child." 
She had Flavia by the hand, and she made the 
little girl her special charge throughout the journey. 
The old Squire seemed anxious to be alone, and he 
restlessly escaped from Marcia 's care. He sat all the 
first day apart, chewing upon some fragment of wood 
that he had picked up, and now and then putting up 
a lank hand to rasp his bristling jaw ; glancing fur 
tively at people who passed him, and lapsing into his 
ruminant abstraction. He had been vexed that they 
did not start the night before; and every halt the 
train made visibly afflicted him. He would not leave 
his place to get anything to eat when they stopped 
for refreshment, though he hungrily devoured the 
lunch that Marcia brought into the car for him. 
At New York he was in a tumult of fear lest they 
should lose the connecting train on the Pennsylvania 
Road; and the sigh of relief with which he sank 
into his seat in the sleeping-car expressed the suffer 
ing he had undergone. He said he was not tired, but 
he went to bed early, as if to sleep away as much of 
the time as he could. 

When Halleck came into their car, the next morn 
ing, he found Marcia and her father sitting together, 
and looking out of the window at the wooded slopes 
of .the Alleghanies through which the train was run 
ning. The old man 's impatience had relaxed ; he let 



 

Marcia lay her hand on his, and he answered her with 
quiet submission, when she spoke now and then of 
the difference between these valleys, where the wild 
rhododendrons were growing, and the frozen hollows 
of the hills at home, which must be still choked with 
snow. 

" But, oh ! how much I would rather see them ! " 
she said at last with a homesick throb. 

" Well," he assented, " we can go right back 
afterwards." 

" Yes," she whispered. 

"Well, sir, good morning," said the old man to 
Halleck, " we are getting along, sir. At this rate, un 
less our calculations were mistaken, we shall be there 
by midnight. We are on time, the porter tells me." 

" Yes, we shall soon be at Pittsburg," said Halleck, 
and he looked at Marcia, who turned away her face. 
She had not spoken of the object of the journey to 
him since they had left Boston, and it had not been so 
nearly touched by either of them before. 

He could see that she recoiled from it, but the old 
man, once having approached it, could not leave it. 
" If everything goes well, we shall have our grip on 
that fellow 's throat in less than forty-eight hours." 
He looked down mechanically at his withered hands, 
lean and yellow like the talons of a bird, and lifted 
his accipitral profile with a predatory alertness. " I 
didn 't sleep very well the last part of the night, but I 
thought it all out. I shan 't  care whether I get there 
before or after judgment is rendered; all I want is to 
get there before he has a chance to clear out. I think 
I shall be able to convince Bartley Hubbard that 
there is a God in Israel yet ! Don 't you be anxious, 
Marcia ; I 've got this thing at my fingers ends, as clear 
as a bell. I intend to give Bartley a little surprise ! " 

Marcia kept her face averted, and Halleck relin - 
quished his purpose of sitting down with them, and 



 

went forward to the state-room that Marcia and Olive 
had occupied with the little girl. He tapped on the 
door, and found his sister dressed, but the child still 
asleep. 

" What is the matter, Ben ? " she asked. " You 
don 't look well. You oughtn 't to have undertaken 
this journey." 

" Oh, I in all right. But I 've been up a good while, 
wibli nothing to eat. That old man is terrible, 
Olive ! " 

" Her father ? Yes, he 's a terrible old man ! " 

"It sickened me to hear him talk, just now, 
throwing out his threats of vengeance against Hubbard. 
It made me feel a sort of sympathy for that poor dog. 
Do you suppose she has the same motive ? I couldn 't 
forgive her ! " he said, with a kind of passionate weak 
ness. " I couldn 't forgive myself ! " 

" We 've got nothing to do with their motive, Ben. 
We are to be her witnesses for justice against a wicked 
wrong. I don 't believe in special providences, of 
course ; but it does seem as if we had been called to 
this work, as mother would say. Your happening to 
go home with her, that night, and then that paper 
happening to come to you, doesn 't it look like it ? " 

" It looks like it, yes." 

" We couldn 't have refused to come. That 's what 
consoles me for being here this minute. I put on a 
bold face with Clara Atherton, yesterday morning at 
the depot ; but I was in a cold chill, all the time. Our 
coming off, in this way, on such an errand, is some 
thing so different from the rest of our whole life ! 
And I do like quiet, and orderly ways, and all that we 
call respectability ! I 've been thinking that the trial 
will be reported by some such interviewing wretch 
as Bartley himself, and that we shall figure in the news 
papers. But I 've concluded that we mustn 't care. 
It 's right, and we must do it. I don 't shut my eyes 



 

to the kind of people we 're mixed up with. I pity 
Marcia, and I love her poor, helpless, unguided 
thing ! but that old man is terrible ! He 's as cruel 
as the grave where he thinks he 's been wronged, and 
crueller where he thinks she 's been wronged. You 've 
forgiven so much, Ben, that you can 't understand a 
man who forgives nothing ; but I can, for I 'm a pretty 
good hater, myself. And Marcia 's just like her father, 
at times. I 've seen her look at Clara Atherton as if 
she could kill her ! " 

The little girl stirred in her berth, and then lifted 
herself on her hands, and stared round at them 
through her tangled golden hair. " Is it morning, 
yet ? " she asked sleepily. " Is it to-morrow ? " 

" Yes ; it 's to-morrow, Flavia," said Olive. " Do 
you want to get up ? " 

" And is next day the day after to-rnorrow ? " 

" Yes." 

" Then it 's only one day till I shall see papa. That 's 
what mamma said. Where is mamma ? " asked the 
child, rising to her knees, and sweeping back her hair 
from her face with either hand. 

" I will go and send her to you," said Halleck. 

At Pittsburg the Squire was eager for his break 
fast, and made amends for his fast of the day before. 
He ate grossly of the heterogeneous abundance of the 
railroad restaurant, and drank two cups of coffee that 
in his thin, native air would have disordered his pulse 
for a week. But he resumed his journey with a tran 
quil strength that seemed the physical expression of 
a mind clear and content. He was willing and even 
anxious to tell Halleck what his theories and plans 
were ; but the young man shrank from knowing them. 
He wished only to know whether Marcia were privy 
to them, and this, too, he shrank from knowing. 



 



XXXIX. 

THEY left Pittsburg under the dun pall of smoke 
that hangs perpetually over the city, and ran out of a 
world where the earth seemed turned to slag and cin 
ders, and the coal grime blackened even the- sheath 
ing from which the young leaves were unfolding their 
vivid green. Their train twisted along the banks of 
the Ohio, and gave them now and then a reach of 
the stream, forgetful of all the noisy traffic that once 
fretted its waters, and losing itself in almost primitive 
wildness among its softly rounded hills. It is a 
beautiful land, and it had, even to their loath eyes, a 
charm that touched their hearts. They were on the 
borders of the illimitable West, whose lands stretch 
like a sea beyond the hilly Ohio shore ; but as yet this 
vastness, which appalls and wearies all but the born 
Westerner, had not burst upon them ; they were still 
among heights and hollows, and in a milder and softer 
New England. 

" I have a strange feeling about this journey," 
said Marcia, turning from the window at last, and 
facing Halleck on the opposite seat. " I want it to 
be over, and yet I am glad of every little stop. I feel 
like some one that has been called to a death-bed, 
and is hurrying on and holding back with all her 
might, at the same time. I shall have no peace till I 
am there, and then shall I have peace ? " She fixed 
her eyes imploringly on his. " Say something to me, 
if you can ! What do you think ? " 

" Whether you will succeed ? " He was con- 



 

founding what he knew of her father 's feeling with 
what he had feared of hers. 

" Do you mean about the lawsuit ? I don 't care 
for that ! Do you think lie will hate me when he 
sees me ? Do you think he will believe me when I 
tell him that I never meant to leave him, and that 
I 'm sorry for what I did to drive him away ? " 

She seemed to expect him to answer, and he 
answered as well as he could : "He ought to believe 
that, yes, he must believe it." 

" Then all the rest may go," she said. " I don 't 
care who gains the case. But if he shouldn 't believe 
me, if he should drive me away from him, as I 
drove him from me She held her breath in the 
terror of such a possibility, and an awe of her igno 
rance crept over Halleck. Apparently she had not 
understood the step that Bartley had taken, except 
as a stage in their quarrel from which they could both 
retreat, if they would, as easily as from any other 
dispute ; she had riot realized it as a final, an almost 
irrevocable act on his part, which could only be met 
by reprisal on hers. All those points of law which 
had been so sharply enforced upon her must have 
fallen blunted from her longing to be at one with 
him ; she had, perhaps, not imagined her defence in 
open court, except as a sort of public reconciliation. 

But at another time she recurred to her wrongs in 
all the bitterness of her father 's vindictive purpose. 
A young couple entered the car at one of the country 
stations, and the bride made haste to take off her 
white bonnet, and lay her cheek on her husband 's 
shoulder, while he passed his arm round her silken 
waist, and drew her close to him on the seat, in the 
loving rapture which is no wise inconvenienced by 
publicity on our railroad trains. Indeed, after the first 
general recognition of their condition, no one noticed 
them except Marcia, who seemed fascinated by the 

 

spectacle of their unsophisticated happiness ; it must 
have recalled the blissful abandon of her own wed 
ding journey to her. "Oh, poor fool!" she said to 
Olive. " Let her wait, and it will not be long before 
she will know that she had better lean on the empty 
air than on him. Some day, he will let her fall to 
the ground, and when she gathers herself up all 
bruised and bleeding But he hasn 't got the all- 
believing simpleton to deal with that he used to have ; 
and he shall pay me back for all drop by drop, and 
ache for ache ! " 

She was in that strange mental condition into 
which women fall who brood long upon opposing 
purposes and desires. She wished to be reconciled, and 
she wished to be revenged, and she recurred to either 
wish for the time as vehemently as if the other did 
not exist. She took Flavia on her knee, and began 
to prattle to her of seeing papa to-morrow, and pres 
ently she turned to Olive, and said : " I know he 
will find us both a great deal changed. Flavia looks 
so much older, and so do I. But I shall soon show 
him that I can look young again. I presume he 's 
changed too." 

Marcia held the little girl up at the window. They 
had now left the river hills and the rolling country 
beyond, and had entered the great plain which 
stretches from the Ohio to the Mississippi ; and mile 
by mile, as they ran southward and westward, the 
spring unfolded in the mellow air under the dull, 
warm sun. The willows were in perfect leaf, and 
wore their delicate green like veils caught upon their 
boughs ; the may-apples had already pitched their 
tents in the woods, beginning to thicken and darken 
with the young foliage of the oaks and hickories ; 
suddenly, as the train dashed from a stretch of forest, 
the peach orchards flushed pink beside the brick 
farmsteads. The child gave a cry of delight, and 



 

pointed ; and her mother seemed to forget all that had 
gone before, and abandoned herself to Flavia 's joy in 
the blossoms, as if there were no trouble for her in the 
world. 

Halleck rose and went into the other car ; he felt 
giddy, as if her fluctuations of mood and motive had 
somehow turned his own brain. He did not come 
back till the train stopped at Columbus for dinner. 
The old Squire showed the same appetite as at break 
fast : he had the effect of falling upon his food like a 
bird of prey ; and as soon as the meal was despatched 
he went back to his seat in the car, where he lapsed 
into his former silence and immobility, his lank jaws 
working with fresh activity upon the wooden tooth 
pick he had brought away from the table. While 
they waited for a train from the north which was to 
connect with theirs, Halleck walked up and down 
the vast, noisy station with Olive and Marcia, and 
humored the little girl in her explorations of the place. 
She made friends with a red-bird that sang in its 
cage in the dining-hall, and with an old woman, 
yellow, and wrinkled, and sunken-eyed, sitting on a 
bundle tied up in a quilt beside the door, and smok 
ing her clay pipe, as placidly as if on her own cabin 
threshold. " Pears like you ain 't much afeard of 
strangers, honey," said the old woman, taking her 
pipe out of her mouth, to fill it. "Where do you 
live at when you 're home ? " 

" Boston," said the child, promptly. " Where do 
you live ?" 

"I used to live in Old Virginny. But my son, 
he 's takin me out to Illinoy, now. He 's settled out 
there." She treated the child with the serious equal 
ity which simple old people use with children ; and 
spat neatly aside in resuming her pipe. " Which 
o them ladies yender is your maw, honey ? " 

" My mamma ? " 



 

The old woman nodded. 

Flavia ran away and laid her hand on Marcia 's 
dress, and then ran back to the old woman. 

" That your paw, with her ? " Flavia looked blank, 
and the old woman interpreted, " Your father." 

" No ! We 're going out to see papa, out West. 
We 're going to see him to-rnorrow, and then he 's 
coming back with us. My grandpa is in that car." 

The old woman now laid her folded arms on her 
knees, and smoked obliviously. The little girl lin 
gered a moment, and then ran off laughing to her 
mother, and pulled her skirt. " Wasn 't it funny, 
mamma ? She thought Mr. Halleck was my papa ! " 
She hung forward by the hold she had taken, as chil 
dren do, and tilted her head back to look into her 
mother 's face. " What is Mr. Halleck, mamma ? " 
" What is he ? " The group halted involuntarily. 
" Yes, what is he ? Is he my uncle, or my cousin, 
or what ? Is he going out to see papa, too ? What is 
he going for ? Oh, look, look ! " The child plucked 
away her hand, and ran off to join the circle of idle 
men and half-grown boys who were forming about 
two shining negroes with banjos. The negroes flung 
their hands upon the strings with an ecstatic joy in 
the music, and lifted their black voices in a wild 
plantation strain. The child began to leap and dance, 
and her mother ran after her. 

" Naughty little girl ! " she cried. " Come into the 
car with me, this minute." 

Halleck did not see Marcia again till the train 
had run far out of the city, and was again sweeping 
through the thick woods, and flashing out upon the 
levels of the fields where the farmers were riding their 
sulky-plows up and down the long furrows in the 
pleasant afternoon sun. There was something in 
this transformation of man 's old-time laborious de 
pendence into a lordly domination over the earth, 



 

which strikes the westward journey er as finally ex 
pressive of human destiny in the whole mighty region, 
and which penetrated even to Halleck 's sore and 
jaded thoughts. A different type of men began to 
show itself in the car, as the Western people gradually 
took the places of his fellow-travellers from the East. 
The men were often slovenly and sometimes uncouth 
in their dress ; but they made themselves at home in 
the exaggerated splendor and opulence of the car, as 
if born to the best in every way ; their faces suggested 
the security of people who trusted the future from 
the past, and had no fears of the life that had always 
used them well ; they had not that eager and intense 
look which the Eastern faces wore ; there was energy 
enough and to spare in them, but it was not an 
anxious energy. The sharp accent of the seaboard 
yielded to tlie rounded, soft, and slurring tones, and 
the prompt address was replaced by a careless and 
confident neighborliness of manner. 

Flavia fretted at her return to captivity in the 
car, and demanded to be released with a teasing per 
sistence from which nothing she was shown out of 
the window could divert her. A large man leaned 
forward at last from a seat near by, and held out an 
orange. " Come here to me, little Trouble," he said ; 
and Flavia made an eager start toward this unlooked- 
for friend. 

Marcia wished to check her ; but Halleck pleaded 
to have her go. " It will be a relief to you," he 
said. 

" Well, let her go," Marcia consented. " But she 
was no trouble, and she is no relief." She sat looking 
dully at the little girl after the Westerner had gath 
ered her up into his lap. " Should I have liked to 
tell her," she said, as if thinking aloud, "how we 
were really going to meet her father, and that you 
were coming with me to be my witness against him

in a court, to put him down ami disgrace him, 

to fight him, as father says ? " 

" You mustn 't think of it in that way," said Hal- 
leek, gently, but, as he felt, feebly and inadequately. 

"Oh, I shall not think of it in that way long," she 
answered. " My head is in a whirl, and I can 't hold 
what we 're doing before my mind in any one shape 
for a minute at a time. I don 't know what will 
become of me, I don 't know what will become of 



But in another breath she rose from this desolation, 
and was talking with impersonal cheerfulness of the 
sights that the car- window showed. As long as the 
light held, they passed through the same opulent and 
monotonous landscape ; through little towns full of 
signs of material prosperity, and then farms, and farms 
again ; the brick houses set in the midst of evergreens, 
and compassed by vast acreages of corn land, where 
herds of black pigs wandered, and the farmers were 
riding their ploughs, or heaping into vast windrows for 
burning the winter-worn stalks of the last year 's crop. 
Where they came to a stream the landscape was 
roughened into low hills, from which it sank again 
luxuriously to a plain. If there was any difference 
between Ohio and Indiana, it was that in Indiana 
the spring night, whose breath softly buffeted their 
cheeks through the open window, had gathered over 
those eternal cornfields, where the long crooked wind 
rows, burning on either hand, seemed a trail of fiery 
serpents writhing away from the train as it roared 
and clamored over the track. 

They were to leave their car at Indianapolis, and 
take another road which would bring them to Tecum- 
seh by daylight the next morning. Olive went away 
with the little girl, and put her to bed on the sofa in 
their state-room, and Marcia suffered them to go 
alone ; it was only by fits that she had cared for the 



 

cliild, or even noticed it. " Now tell me again," she 
said to Halleck, " why we are going." 

" Surely you know^ 

" Yes, yes, I know ; but I can 't think, I don 't 
seem to remember. .Didn 't I give it up once ? Didn 't 
I say that I would rather go home, and let Bartley 
get the divorce, if lie wanted ? " 

" Yes, you said that, Marcia." 

" I used to make him very unhappy ; I was very 
strict with him, when I knew he couldn 't bear any 
kind of strictness. And he was always so patient 
with me ; though he never really cared for me. Oh, 
yes, I knew that from the first ! He used to try ; but 
he must have been glad to get away. Poor Bartley! 
It was cruel, cruel, to put that in about my abandon 
ing him when he knew I would come back ; but per 
haps the lawyers told him he must ; he had to put in 
something ! Why shouldn 't I let him go ? Father 
said he only wanted to get rid of me, so that he could 
marry some one else Yes, yes ; it was that that 
made me start ! Father knew it would ! Oh," she 
grieved, with a wild self-pity that tore Halleck 's 
heart, " he knew it would ! " She fell wearily back 
against the seat, and did not speak for some minutes. 
Then she said, in a slow, broken utterance : " But 
now I don 't seem to mind even that, any more. Why 
shouldn 't he marry some one else that he really likes, 
if he doesn 't care for me ? " 

Halleck laughed in bitterness of soul as his thought 
recurred to Atherton 's reasons. " Because," he said, 
" you have a public duty in the matter. You must 
keep him bound to you, for fear some other woman, 
whose husband doesn 't care for her, should let Mm 
go, too, and society be broken up, and civilization 
destroyed. In a matter like this, which seems to 
concern yourself alone, you are only to regard others." 

His reckless irony did not reach her through her 



 

manifold sorrow. "Well," she said, simply, "it must 
be that. But, oh ! how can I bear it ! how can I bear
