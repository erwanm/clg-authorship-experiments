sympathetic discomfort provoked by the masters whose conceptions were
still a trifle too large for their means. The pictorial vision in their
minds seems to stretch and strain their undeveloped skill almost to a
sense of pain. In Ghirlandaio the skill and the imagination are equal,
and he gives us a delightful impression of enjoying his own resources.
Of all the painters of his time he affects us least as positively not
of ours. He enjoyed a crimson mantle spreading and tumbling in curious
folds and embroidered with needlework of gold, just as he enjoyed a
handsome well-rounded head, with vigorous dusky locks, profiled in
courteous adoration. He enjoyed in short the various reality of things,
and had the good fortune to live in an age when reality flowered into a
thousand amusing graces--to speak only of those. He was not especially
addicted to giving spiritual hints; and yet how hard and meagre they
seem, the professed and finished realists of our own day, with the
spiritual bonhomie or candour that makes half Ghirlandaio’s richness
left out! The Last Supper at San Marco is an excellent example of the
natural reverence of an artist of that time with whom reverence was
not, as one may say, a specialty. The main idea with him has been the
variety, the material bravery and positively social charm of the
scene, which finds expression, with irrepressible generosity, in the
accessories of the background. Instinctively he imagines an opulent
garden--imagines it with a good faith which quite tides him over the
reflection that Christ and his disciples were poor men and unused to sit
at meat in palaces. Great full-fruited orange-trees peep over the wall
before which the table is spread, strange birds fly through the air,
while a peacock perches on the edge of the partition and looks down
on the sacred repast. It is striking that, without any at all intense
religious purpose, the figures, in their varied naturalness, have a
dignity and sweetness of attitude that admits of numberless reverential
constructions. I should call all this the happy tact of a robust faith.

On the staircase leading up to the little painted cells of the Beato
Angelico, however, I suddenly faltered and paused. Somehow I had grown
averse to the intenser zeal of the Monk of Fiesole. I wanted no more of
him that day. I wanted no more macerated friars and spear-gashed sides.
Ghirlandaio’s elegant way of telling his story had put me in the humour
for something more largely intelligent, more profanely pleasing.
I departed, walked across the square, and found it in the Academy,
standing in a particular spot and looking up at a particular high-hung
picture. It is difficult to speak adequately, perhaps even intelligibly,
of Sandro Botticelli. An accomplished critic--Mr. Pater, in his Studies
on the History of the Renaissance--has lately paid him the tribute
of an exquisite, a supreme, curiosity. He was rarity and distinction
incarnate, and of all the multitudinous masters of his group
incomparably the most interesting, the one who detains and perplexes
and fascinates us most. Exquisitely fine his imagination--infinitely
audacious and adventurous his fancy. Alone among the painters of his
time he strikes us as having invention. The glow and thrill of expanding
observation--this was the feeling that sent his comrades to their
easels; but Botticelli’s moved him to reactions and emotions of which
they knew nothing, caused his faculty to sport and wander and explore
on its own account. These impulses have fruits often so ingenious and so
lovely that it would be easy to talk nonsense about them. I hope it is
not nonsense, however, to say that the picture to which I just alluded
(the “Coronation of the Virgin,” with a group of life-sized saints
below and a garland of miniature angels above) is one of the supremely
beautiful productions of the human mind. It is hung so high that
you need a good glass to see it; to say nothing of the unprecedented
delicacy of the work. The lower half is of moderate interest; but the
dance of hand-clasped angels round the heavenly couple above has a
beauty newly exhaled from the deepest sources of inspiration. Their
perfect little hands are locked with ineffable elegance; their blowing
robes are tossed into folds of which each line is a study; their
charming feet have the relief of the most delicate sculpture. But, as
I have already noted, of Botticelli there is much, too much to
say--besides which Mr. Pater has said all. Only add thus to his
inimitable grace of design that the exquisite pictorial force driving
him goes a-Maying not on wanton errands of its own, but on those of some
mystic superstition which trembles for ever in his heart.

The more I look at the old Florentine domestic architecture the more I
like it--that of the great examples at least; and if I ever am able to
build myself a lordly pleasure-house I don’t see how in conscience I can
build it different from these. They are sombre and frowning, and look
a trifle more as if they were meant to keep people out than to let
them in; but what equally “important” type--if there be an equally
important--is more expressive of domiciliary dignity and security and
yet attests them with a finer æesthetic economy? They are impressively
“handsome,” and yet contrive to be so by the simplest means. I don’t say
at the smallest pecuniary cost--that’s another matter. There is money
buried in the thick walls and diffused through the echoing excess of
space. The merchant nobles of the fifteenth century had deep and full
pockets, I suppose, though the present bearers of their names are glad
to let out their palaces in suites of apartments which are occupied by
the commercial aristocracy of another republic. One is told of fine old
mouldering chambers of which possession is to be enjoyed for a sum not
worth mentioning. I am afraid that behind these so gravely harmonious
fronts there is a good deal of dusky discomfort, and I speak now simply
of the large serious faces themselves as you can see them from the
street; see them ranged cheek to cheek, in the grey historic light of
Via dei Bardi, Via Maggio, Via degli Albizzi. The force of character,
the familiar severity and majesty, depend on a few simple features: on
the great iron-caged windows of the rough-hewn basement; on the noble
stretch of space between the summit of one high, round-topped window
and the bottom of that above; on the high-hung sculptured shield at the
angle of the house; on the flat far-projecting roof; and, finally, on
the magnificent tallness of the whole building, which so dwarfs our
modern attempts at size. The finest of these Florentine palaces are, I
imagine, the tallest habitations in Europe that are frankly and
amply habitations--not mere shafts for machinery of the American
grain-elevator pattern. Some of the creations of M. Haussmann in Paris
may climb very nearly as high; but there is all the difference in the
world between the impressiveness of a building which takes breath, as
it were, some six or seven times, from storey to storey, and of one that
erects itself to an equal height in three long-drawn pulsations. When
a house is ten windows wide and the drawing-room floor is as high as a
chapel it can afford but three floors. The spaciousness of some of those
ancient drawing-rooms is that of a Russian steppe. The “family circle,”
 gathered anywhere within speaking distance, must resemble a group of
pilgrims encamped in the desert on a little oasis of carpet. Madame
Gryzanowska, living at the top of a house in that dusky, tortuous old
Borgo Pinti, initiated me the other evening most good-naturedly, lamp in
hand, into the far-spreading mysteries of her apartment. Such quarters
seem a translation into space of the old-fashioned idea of leisure.
Leisure and “room” have been passing out of our manners together, but
here and there, being of stouter structure, the latter lingers and
survives.

Here and there, indeed, in this blessed Italy, reluctantly modern in
spite alike of boasts and lamentations, it seems to have been preserved
for curiosity’s and fancy’s sake, with a vague, sweet odour of the
embalmer’s spices about it. I went the other morning to the Corsini
Palace. The proprietors obviously are great people. One of the ornaments
of Rome is their great white-faced palace in the dark Trastevere and
its voluminous gallery, none the less delectable for the poorness of
the pictures. Here they have a palace on the Arno, with another large,
handsome, respectable and mainly uninteresting collection. It contains
indeed three or four fine examples of early Florentines. It was not
especially for the pictures that I went, however; and certainly not for
the pictures that I stayed. I was under the same spell as the inveterate
companion with whom I walked the other day through the beautiful private
apartments of the Pitti Palace and who said: “I suppose I care for
nature, and I know there have been times when I have thought it the
greatest pleasure in life to lie under a tree and gaze away at blue
hills. But just now I had rather lie on that faded sea-green satin sofa
and gaze down through the open door at that retreating vista of gilded,
deserted, haunted chambers. In other words I prefer a good ‘interior’
to a good landscape. The impression has a greater intensity--the thing
itself a more complex animation. I like fine old rooms that have been
occupied in a fine old way. I like the musty upholstery, the antiquated
knick-knacks, the view out of the tall deep-embrasured windows at garden
cypresses rocking against a grey sky. If you don’t know why, I’m afraid
I can’t tell you.” It seemed to me at the Palazzo Corsini that I did
know why. In places that have been lived in so long and so much and in
such a fine old way, as my friend said--that is under social conditions
so multifold and to a comparatively starved and democratic sense so
curious--the past seems to have left a sensible deposit, an aroma, an
atmosphere. This ghostly presence tells you no secrets, but it prompts
you to try and guess a few. What has been done and said here through so
many years, what has been ventured or suffered, what has been dreamed or
despaired of? Guess the riddle if you can, or if you think it worth
your ingenuity. The rooms at Palazzo Corsini suggest indeed, and seem
to recall, but a monotony of peace and plenty. One of them imaged such
a noble perfection of a home-scene that I dawdled there until the old
custodian came shuffling back to see whether possibly I was trying
to conceal a Caravaggio about my person: a great crimson-draped
drawing-room of the amplest and yet most charming proportions; walls
hung with large dark pictures, a great concave ceiling frescoed and
moulded with dusky richness, and half-a-dozen south windows looking out
on the Arno, whose swift yellow tide sends up the light in a cheerful
flicker. I fear that in my appreciation of the particular effect so
achieved I uttered a monstrous folly--some momentary willingness to be
maimed or crippled all my days if I might pass them in such a place. In
fact half the pleasure of inhabiting this spacious saloon would be that
of using one’s legs, of strolling up and down past the windows, one by
one, and making desultory journeys from station to station and corner
to corner. Near by is a colossal ball-room, domed and pilastered like
a Renaissance cathedral, and super-abundantly decorated with marble
effigies, all yellow and grey with the years.


VI


In the Carthusian Monastery outside the Roman Gate, mutilated and
profaned though it is, one may still snuff up a strong if stale
redolence of old Catholicism and old Italy. The road to it is ugly,
being encumbered with vulgar waggons and fringed with tenements
suggestive of an Irish-American suburb. Your interest begins as you
come in sight of the convent perched on its little mountain and lifting
against the sky, around the bell-tower of its gorgeous chapel, a coronet
of clustered cells. You make your way into the lower gate, through a
clamouring press of deformed beggars who thrust at you their stumps
of limbs, and you climb the steep hillside through a shabby plantation
which it is proper to fancy was better tended in the monkish time. The
monks are not totally abolished, the government having the grace to
await the natural extinction of the half-dozen old brothers who remain,
and who shuffle doggedly about the cloisters, looking, with their white
robes and their pale blank old faces, quite anticipatory ghosts of their
future selves. A prosaic, profane old man in a coat and trousers serves
you, however, as custodian. The melancholy friars have not even the
privilege of doing you the honours of their dishonour. One must imagine
the pathetic effect of their former silent pointings to this and that
conventual treasure under stress of the feeling that such pointings were
narrowly numbered. The convent is vast and irregular--it bristles with
those picture-making arts and accidents which one notes as one lingers
and passes, but which in Italy the overburdened memory learns to resolve
into broadly general images. I rather deplore its position at the gates
of a bustling city--it ought rather to be lodged in some lonely fold of
the Apennines. And yet to look out from the shady porch of one of the
quiet cells upon the teeming vale of the Arno and the clustered towers
of Florence must have deepened the sense of monastic quietude.

The chapel, or rather the church, which is of great proportions and
designed by Andrea Orcagna, the primitive painter, refines upon the
consecrated type or even quite glorifies it. The massive cincture
of black sculptured stalls, the dusky Gothic roof, the high-hung,
deep-toned pictures and the superb pavement of verd-antique and dark red
marble, polished into glassy lights, must throw the white-robed figures
of the gathered friars into the highest romantic relief. All this luxury
of worship has nowhere such value as in the chapels of monasteries,
where we find it contrasted with the otherwise so ascetic economy of the
worshippers. The paintings and gildings of their church, the gem-bright
marbles and fantastic carvings, are really but the monastic tribute to
sensuous delight--an imperious need for which the fond imagination of
Rome has officiously opened the door. One smiles when one thinks how
largely a fine starved sense for the forbidden things of earth, if it
makes the most of its opportunities, may gratify this need under
cover of devotion. Nothing is too base, too hard, too sordid for real
humility, but nothing too elegant, too amiable, too caressing, caressed,
caressable, for the exaltation of faith. The meaner the convent cell the
richer the convent chapel. Out of poverty and solitude, inanition and
cold, your honest friar may rise at his will into a Mahomet’s Paradise
of luxurious analogies.

There are further various dusky subterranean oratories where a number
of bad pictures contend faintly with the friendly gloom. Two or three of
these funereal vaults, however, deserve mention. In one of them, side
by side, sculptured by Donatello in low relief, lie the white marble
effigies of the three members of the Accaiuoli family who founded the
convent in the thirteenth century. In another, on his back, on the
pavement, rests a grim old bishop of the same stout race by the same
honest craftsman. Terribly grim he is, and scowling as if in his stony
sleep he still dreamed of his hates and his hard ambitions. Last and
best, in another low chapel, with the trodden pavement for its bed,
shines dimly a grand image of a later bishop--Leonardo Buonafede, who,
dying in 1545, owes his monument to Francesco di San Gallo. I have seen
little from this artist’s hand, but it was clearly of the cunningest.
His model here was a very sturdy old prelate, though I should say a very
genial old man. The sculptor has respected his monumental ugliness,
but has suffused it with a singular homely charm--a look of confessed
physical comfort in the privilege of paradise. All these figures have
an inimitable reality, and their lifelike marble seems such an
incorruptible incarnation of the genius of the place that you begin to
think of it as even more reckless than cruel on the part of the present
public powers to have begun to pull the establishment down, morally
speaking, about their ears. They are lying quiet yet a while; but when
the last old friar dies and the convent formally lapses, won’t they rise
on their stiff old legs and hobble out to the gates and thunder forth
anathemas before which even a future and more enterprising régime may be
disposed to pause?

Out of the great central cloister open the snug little detached
dwellings of the absent fathers. When I said just now that the Certosa
in Val d’Ema gives you a glimpse of old Italy I was thinking of this
great pillared quadrangle, lying half in sun and half in shade, of its
tangled garden-growth in the centre, surrounding the ancient customary
well, and of the intense blue sky bending above it, to say nothing of
the indispensable old white-robed monk who pokes about among the lettuce
and parsley. We have seen such places before; we have visited them in
that divinatory glance which strays away into space for a moment over
the top of a suggestive book. I don’t quite know whether it’s more or
less as one’s fancy would have it that the monkish cells are no cells
at all, but very tidy little appartements complets, consisting of a
couple of chambers, a sitting-room and a spacious loggia, projecting out
into space from the cliff-like wall of the monastery and sweeping from
pole to pole the loveliest view in the world. It’s poor work, however,
taking notes on views, and I will let this one pass. The little chambers
are terribly cold and musty now. Their odour and atmosphere are such
as one used, as a child, to imagine those of the school-room during
Saturday and Sunday.


VII


In the Roman streets, wherever you turn, the facade of a church in more
or less degenerate flamboyance is the principal feature of the scene;
and if, in the absence of purer motives, you are weary of aesthetic
trudging over the corrugated surface of the Seven Hills, a system of
pavement in which small cobble-stones anomalously endowed with angles
and edges are alone employed, you may turn aside at your pleasure and
take a reviving sniff at the pungency of incense. In Florence, one soon
observes, the churches are relatively few and the dusky house-fronts
more rarely interrupted by specimens of that extraordinary architecture
which in Rome passes for sacred. In Florence, in other words,
ecclesiasticism is less cheap a commodity and not dispensed in the same
abundance at the street-corners. Heaven forbid, at the same time, that
I should undervalue the Roman churches, which are for the most
part treasure-houses of history, of curiosity, of promiscuous and
associational interest. It is a fact, nevertheless, that, after St.
Peter’s, I know but one really beautiful church by the Tiber, the
enchanting basilica of St. Mary Major. Many have structural character,
some a great allure, but as a rule they all lack the dignity of
the best of the Florentine temples. Here, the list being immeasurably
shorter and the seed less scattered, the principal churches are all
beautiful. And yet I went into the Annunziata the other day and sat
there for half-an-hour because, forsooth, the gildings and the marbles
and the frescoed dome and the great rococo shrine near the door, with
its little black jewelled fetish, reminded me so poignantly of Rome.
Such is the city properly styled eternal--since it is eternal, at least,
as regards the consciousness of the individual. One loves it in its
sophistications--though for that matter isn’t it all rich and precious
sophistication?--better than other places in their purity.

Coming out of the Annunziata you look past the bronze statue of the
Grand Duke Ferdinand I (whom Mr. Browning’s heroine used to watch
for--in the poem of “The Statue and the Bust”--from the red palace near
by), and down a street vista of enchanting picturesqueness. The street
is narrow and dusky and filled with misty shadows, and at its opposite
end rises the vast bright-coloured side of the Cathedral. It stands up
in very much the same mountainous fashion as the far-shining mass of the
bigger prodigy at Milan, of which your first glimpse as you leave your
hotel is generally through another such dark avenue; only that, if we
talk of mountains, the white walls of Milan must be likened to snow and
ice from their base, while those of the Duomo of Florence may be the
image of some mighty hillside enamelled with blooming flowers. The big
bleak interior here has a naked majesty which, though it may fail of
its effect at first, becomes after a while extraordinarily touching.
Originally disconcerting, it soon inspired me with a passion.
Externally, at any rate, it is one of the loveliest works of man’s
hands, and an overwhelming proof into the bargain that when elegance
belittles grandeur you have simply had a bungling artist.

Santa Croce within not only triumphs here, but would triumph anywhere.
“A trifle naked if you like,” said my irrepressible companion, “but
that’s what I call architecture, just as I don’t call bronze or marble
clothes (save under urgent stress of portraiture) statuary.” And indeed
we are far enough away from the clustering odds and ends borrowed from
every art and every province without which the ritually builded thing
doesn’t trust its spell to work in Rome. The vastness, the lightness,
the open spring of the arches at Santa Croce, the beautiful shape of the
high and narrow choir, the impression made as of mass without weight and
the gravity yet reigning without gloom--these are my frequent delight,
and the interest grows with acquaintance. The place is the great
Florentine Valhalla, the final home or memorial harbour of the native
illustrious dead, but that consideration of it would take me far. It
must be confessed moreover that, between his coarsely-imagined statue
out in front and his horrible monument in one of the aisles, the author
of The Divine Comedy, for instance, is just hereabouts rather an
extravagant figure. “Ungrateful Florence,” declaims Byron. Ungrateful
indeed--would she were more so! the susceptible spirit of the great
exile may be still aware enough to exclaim; in common, that is, with
most of the other immortals sacrificed on so very large a scale to
current Florentine “plastic” facility. In explanation of which remark,
however, I must confine myself to noting that, as almost all the old
monuments at Santa Croce are small, comparatively small, and interesting
and exquisite, so the modern, well nigh without exception, are
disproportionately vast and pompous, or in other words distressingly
vague and vain. The aptitude of hand, the compositional assurance, with
which such things are nevertheless turned out, constitutes an anomaly
replete with suggestion for an observer of the present state of the arts
on the soil and in the air that once befriended them, taking them all
together, as even the soil and the air of Greece scarce availed to do.
But on this head, I repeat, there would be too much to say; and I find
myself checked by the same warning at the threshold of the church in
Florence really interesting beyond Santa Croce, beyond all others. Such,
of course, easily, is Santa Maria Novella, where the chapels are lined
and plated with wonderful figured and peopled fresco-work even as most
of those in Rome with precious inanimate substances. These overscored
retreats of devotion, as dusky, some of them, as eremitic caves swarming
with importunate visions, have kept me divided all winter between the
love of Ghirlandaio and the fear of those seeds of catarrh to which
their mortal chill seems propitious till far on into the spring. So
I pause here just on the praise of that delightful painter--as to
the spirit of whose work the reflections I have already made are but
confirmed by these examples. In the choir at Santa Maria Novella, where
the incense swings and the great chants resound, between the gorgeous
coloured window and the florid grand altar, he still “goes in,” with
all his might, for the wicked, the amusing world, the world of faces and
forms and characters, of every sort of curious human and rare material
thing.

{Illustration: BOBOLI GARDEN, FLORENCE.}


VIII


I had always felt the Boboli Gardens charming enough for me to “haunt”
 them; and yet such is the interest of Florence in every quarter that it
took another corso of the same cheap pattern as the last to cause me
yesterday to flee the crowded streets, passing under that archway of the
Pitti Palace which might almost be the gate of an Etruscan city, so that
I might spend the afternoon among the mouldy statues that compose with
their screens of cypress, looking down at our clustered towers and our
background of pale blue hills vaguely freckled with white villas. These
pleasure-grounds of the austere Pitti pile, with its inconsequent charm
of being so rough-hewn and yet somehow so elegantly balanced, plead with
a voice all their own the general cause of the ample enclosed, planted,
cultivated private preserve--preserve of tranquillity and beauty and
immunity--in the heart of a city; a cause, I allow, for that matter,
easy to plead anywhere, once the pretext is found, the large, quiet,
distributed town-garden, with the vague hum of big grudging boundaries
all about it, but with everything worse excluded, being of course the
most insolently-pleasant thing in the world. In addition to which, when
the garden is in the Italian manner, with flowers rather remarkably
omitted, as too flimsy and easy and cheap, and without lawns that
are too smart, paths that are too often swept and shrubs that are too
closely trimmed, though with a fanciful formalism giving style to its
shabbiness, and here and there a dusky ilex-walk, and here and there a
dried-up fountain, and everywhere a piece of mildewed sculpture staring
at you from a green alcove, and just in the right place, above all, a
grassy amphitheatre curtained behind with black cypresses and sloping
downward in mossy marble steps--when, I say, the place possesses these
attractions, and you lounge there of a soft Sunday afternoon, the racier
spectacle of the streets having made your fellow-loungers few and left
you to the deep stillness and the shady vistas that lead you wonder
where, left you to the insidious irresistible mixture of nature and art,
nothing too much of either, only a supreme happy resultant, a divine
tertium quid: under these conditions, it need scarce be said the
revelation invoked descends upon you.

The Boboli Gardens are not large--you wonder how compact little Florence
finds room for them within her walls. But they are scattered, to their
extreme, their all-romantic advantage and felicity, over a group
of steep undulations between the rugged and terraced palace and a
still-surviving stretch of city wall, where the unevenness of the ground
much adds to their apparent size. You may cultivate in them the fancy of
their solemn and haunted character, of something faint and dim and even,
if you like, tragic, in their prescribed, their functional smile; as if
they borrowed from the huge monument that overhangs them certain of its
ponderous memories and regrets. This course is open to you, I mention,
but it isn’t enjoined, and will doubtless indeed not come up for you
at all if it isn’t your habit, cherished beyond any other, to spin your
impressions to the last tenuity of fineness. Now that I bethink myself I
must always have happened to wander here on grey and melancholy days. It
remains none the less true that the place contains, thank goodness--or
at least thank the grave, the infinitely-distinguished traditional
taste of Florence--no cheerful, trivial object, neither parterres, nor
pagodas, nor peacocks, nor swans. They have their famous amphitheatre
already referred to, with its degrees or stone benches of a thoroughly
aged and mottled complexion and its circular wall of evergreens behind,
in which small cracked images and vases, things that, according to
association, and with the law of the same quite indefinable, may make as
much on one occasion for exquisite dignity as they may make on another
for (to express it kindly) nothing at all. Something was once done in
this charmed and forsaken circle--done or meant to be done; what was it,
dumb statues, who saw it with your blank eyes? Opposite stands the
huge flat-roofed palace, putting forward two great rectangular arms and
looking, with its closed windows and its foundations of almost unreduced
rock, like some ghost of a sample of a ruder Babylon. In the wide
court-like space between the wings is a fine old white marble fountain
that never plays. Its dusty idleness completes the general air of
abandonment. Chancing on such a cluster of objects in Italy--glancing at
them in a certain light and a certain mood--I get (perhaps on too easy
terms, you may think) a sense of history that takes away my breath.
Generations of Medici have stood at these closed windows, embroidered
and brocaded according to their period, and held fetes champetres and
floral games on the greensward, beneath the mouldering hemicycle. And
the Medici were great people! But what remains of it all now is a mere
tone in the air, a faint sigh in the breeze, a vague expression in
things, a passive--or call it rather, perhaps, to be fair, a shyly,
pathetically responsive--accessibility to the yearning guess. Call
it much or call it little, the ineffaceability of this deep stain
of experience, it is the interest of old places and the bribe to the
brooding analyst. Time has devoured the doers and their doings, but
there still hangs about some effect of their passage. We can “layout”
 parks on virgin soil, and cause them to bristle with the most expensive
importations, but we unfortunately can’t scatter abroad again this seed
of the eventual human soul of a place--that comes but in its time and
takes too long to grow. There is nothing like it when it has come.





TUSCAN CITIES


The cities I refer to are Leghorn, Pisa, Lucca and Pistoia, among which
I have been spending the last few days. The most striking fact as to
Leghorn, it must be conceded at the outset, is that, being in Tuscany,
it should be so scantily Tuscan. The traveller curious in local colour
must content himself with the deep blue expanse of the Mediterranean.
The streets, away from the docks, are modern, genteel and rectangular;
Liverpool might acknowledge them if it weren’t for their clean-coloured,
sun-bleached stucco. They are the offspring of the new industry which is
death to the old idleness. Of interesting architecture, fruit of the
old idleness or at least of the old leisure, Leghorn is singularly
destitute. It has neither a church worth one’s attention, nor a
municipal palace, nor a museum, and it may claim the distinction, unique
in Italy, of being the city of no pictures. In a shabby corner near
the docks stands a statue of one of the elder Grand Dukes of Tuscany,
appealing to posterity on grounds now vague--chiefly that of having
placed certain Moors under tribute. Four colossal negroes, in very bad
bronze, are chained to the base of the monument, which forms with their
assistance a sufficiently fantastic group; but to patronise the arts is
not the line of the Livornese, and for want of the slender annuity
which would keep its precinct sacred this curious memorial is buried
in dockyard rubbish. I must add that on the other hand there is a very
well-conditioned and, in attitude and gesture, extremely natural and
familiar statue of Cavour in one of the city squares, and in another a
couple of effigies of recent Grand Dukes, represented, that is dressed,
or rather undressed, in the character of heroes of Plutarch. Leghorn
is a city of magnificent spaces, and it was so long a journey from the
sidewalk to the pedestal of these images that I never took the time
to go and read the inscriptions. And in truth, vaguely, I bore the
originals a grudge, and wished to know as little about them as possible;
for it seemed to me that as patres patrae, in their degree, they might
have decreed that the great blank, ochre-faced piazza should be a trifle
less ugly. There is a distinct amenity, however, in any experience of
Italy almost anywhere, and I shall probably in the future not be above
sparing a light regret to several of the hours of which the one I speak
of was composed. I shall remember a large cool bourgeois villa in the
garden of a noiseless suburb--a middle-aged Villa Franco (I owe it as a
genial pleasant pension the tribute of recognition), roomy and stony,
as an Italian villa should be. I shall remember that, as I sat in the
garden, and, looking up from my book, saw through a gap in the shrubbery
the red house-tiles against the deep blue sky and the grey underside of
the ilex-leaves turned up by the Mediterranean breeze, it was all still
quite Tuscany, if Tuscany in the minor key.

If you should naturally desire, in such conditions, a higher intensity,
you have but to proceed, by a very short journey, to Pisa--where, for
that matter, you will seem to yourself to have hung about a good deal
already, and from an early age. Few of us can have had a childhood
so unblessed by contact with the arts as that one of its occasional
diversions shan’t have been a puzzled scrutiny of some alabaster model
of the Leaning Tower under a glass cover in a back-parlour. Pisa and its
monuments have, in other words, been industriously vulgarised, but it
is astonishing how well they have survived the process. The charm of the
place is in fact of a high order and but partially foreshadowed by the
famous crookedness of its campanile. I felt it irresistibly and yet
almost inexpressibly the other afternoon, as I made my way to the
classic corner of the city through the warm drowsy air which nervous
people come to inhale as a sedative. I was with an invalid companion who
had had no sleep to speak of for a fortnight. “Ah! stop the carriage,”
 she sighed, or yawned, as I could feel, deliciously, “in the shadow of
this old slumbering palazzo, and let me sit here and close my eyes, and
taste for an hour of oblivion.” Once strolling over the grass, however,
out of which the quartette of marble monuments rises, we awaked
responsively enough to the present hour. Most people remember the happy
remark of tasteful, old-fashioned Forsyth (who touched a hundred other
points in his “Italy” scarce less happily) as to the fact that the
four famous objects are “fortunate alike in their society and their
solitude.” It must be admitted that they are more fortunate in their
society than we felt ourselves to be in ours; for the scene presented
the animated appearance for which, on any fine spring day, all the
choicest haunts of ancient quietude in Italy are becoming yearly more
remarkable. There were clamorous beggars at all the sculptured portals,
and bait for beggars, in abundance, trailing in and out of them under
convoy of loquacious ciceroni. I forget just how I apportioned the
responsibility, of intrusion, for it was not long before fellow-tourists
and fellow-countrymen became a vague, deadened, muffled presence, that
of the dentist’s last words when he is giving you ether. They suffered
mystic disintegration in the dense, bright, tranquil air, so charged
with its own messages. The Cathedral and its companions are fortunate
indeed in everything--fortunate in the spacious angle of the grey old
city-wall which folds about them in their sculptured elegance like a
strong protecting arm; fortunate in the broad greensward which stretches
from the marble base of Cathedral and cemetery to the rugged foot of the
rampart; fortunate in the little vagabonds who dot the grass, plucking
daisies and exchanging Italian cries; fortunate in the pale-gold tone to
which time and the soft sea-damp have mellowed and darkened their marble
plates; fortunate, above all, in an indescribable grace of grouping,
half hazard, half design, which insures them, in one’s memory of things
admired, very much the same isolated corner that they occupy in the
charming city.

Of the smaller cathedrals of Italy I know none I prefer to that of Pisa;
none that, on a moderate scale, produces more the impression of a great
church. It has without so modest a measurability, represents so clean
and compact a mass, that you are startled when you cross the threshold
at the apparent space it encloses. An architect of genius, for all that
he works with colossal blocks and cumbrous pillars, is certainly the
most cunning of conjurors. The front of the Duomo is a small pyramidal
screen, covered with delicate carvings and chasings, distributed over
a series of short columns upholding narrow arches. It might be a
sought imitation of goldsmith’s work in stone, and the area covered is
apparently so small that extreme fineness has been prescribed. How it is
therefore that on the inner side of this façade the wall should appear
to rise to a splendid height and to support one end of a ceiling as
remote in its gilded grandeur, one could almost fancy, as that of St.
Peter’s; how it is that the nave should stretch away in such solemn
vastness, the shallow transepts emphasise the grand impression and the
apse of the choir hollow itself out like a dusky cavern fretted
with golden stalactites, is all matter for exposition by a keener
architectural analyst than I. To sit somewhere against a pillar where
the vista is large and the incidents cluster richly, and vaguely revolve
these mysteries without answering them, is the best of one’s usual
enjoyment of a great church. It takes no deep sounding to conclude
indeed that a gigantic Byzantine Christ in mosaic, on the concave roof
of the choir, contributes largely to the particular impression here as
of very old and choice and original and individual things. It has even
more of stiff solemnity than is common to works of its school, and
prompts to more wonder than ever on the nature of the human mind at a
time when such unlovely shapes could satisfy its conception of holiness.
Truly pathetic is the fate of these huge mosaic idols, thanks to the
change that has overtaken our manner of acceptance of them. Strong the
contrast between the original sublimity of their pretensions and the way
in which they flatter that free sense of the grotesque which the modern
imagination has smuggled even into the appreciation of religious forms.
They were meant to yield scarcely to the Deity itself in grandeur, but
the only part they play now is to stare helplessly at our critical, our
aesthetic patronage of them. The spiritual refinement marking the hither
end of a progress had n’t, however, to wait for us to signalise it; it
found expression three centuries ago in the beautiful specimen of the
painter Sodoma on the wall of the choir. This latter, a small Sacrifice
of Isaac, is one of the best examples of its exquisite author, and
perhaps, as chance has it, the most perfect opposition that could
be found in the way of the range of taste to the effect of the great
mosaic. There are many painters more powerful than Sodoma--painters who,
like the author of the mosaic, attempted and compassed grandeur; but
none has a more persuasive grace, none more than he was to sift and
chasten a conception till it should affect one with the sweetness of a
perfectly distilled perfume.

Of the patient successive efforts of painting to arrive at the supreme
refinement of such a work as the Sodoma the Campo Santo hard by offers a
most interesting memorial. It presents a long, blank marble wall to the
relative profaneness of the Cathedral close, but within it is a perfect
treasure-house of art. This quadrangular defence surrounds an open court
where weeds and wild roses are tangled together and a sunny stillness
seems to rest consentingly, as if Nature had been won to consciousness
of the precious relics committed to her. Something in the quality of the
place recalls the collegiate cloisters of Oxford, but it must be added
that this is the handsomest compliment to that seat of learning. The
open arches of the quadrangles of Magdalen and Christ Church are not
of mellow Carrara marble, nor do they offer to sight columns, slim and
elegant, that seem to frame the unglazed windows of a cathedral. To be
buried in the Campo Santo of Pisa, I may however further qualify, you
need only be, or to have more or less anciently been, illustrious, and
there is a liberal allowance both as to the character and degree of
your fame. The most obtrusive object in one of the long vistas is a most
complicated monument to Madame Catalani, the singer, recently erected
by her possibly too-appreciative heirs. The wide pavement is a mosaic of
sepulchral slabs, and the walls, below the base of the paling frescoes,
are incrusted with inscriptions and encumbered with urns and antique
sarcophagi. The place is at once a cemetery and a museum, and its
especial charm is its strange mixture of the active and the passive,
of art and rest, of life and death. Originally its walls were one vast
continuity of closely pressed frescoes; but now the great capricious
scars and stains have come to outnumber the pictures, and the cemetery
has grown to be a burial-place of pulverised masterpieces as well as of
finished lives. The fragments of painting that remain are fortunately
the best; for one is safe in believing that a host of undimmed
neighbours would distract but little from the two great works of
Orcagna. Most people know the “Triumph of Death” and the “Last Judgment”
 from descriptions and engravings; but to measure the possible good faith
of imitative art one must stand there and see the painter’s howling
potentates dragged into hell in all the vividness of his bright hard
colouring; see his feudal courtiers, on their palfreys, hold their noses
at what they are so fast coming to; see his great Christ, in judgment,
refuse forgiveness with a gesture commanding enough, really inhuman
enough, to make virtue merciless for ever. The charge that Michael
Angelo borrowed his cursing Saviour from this great figure of Orcagna is
more valid than most accusations of plagiarism; but of the two figures
one at least could be spared. For direct, triumphant expressiveness
these two superb frescoes have probably never been surpassed. The
painter aims at no very delicate meanings, but he drives certain gross
ones home so effectively that for a parallel to his process one must
look to the art of the actor, the emphasising “point”--making mime.
Some of his female figures are superb--they represent creatures of a
formidable temperament.

There are charming women, however, on the other side of the cloister--in
the beautiful frescoes of Benozzo Gozzoli. If Orcagna’s work was
appointed to survive the ravage of time it is a happy chance that
it should be balanced by a group of performances of such a different
temper. The contrast is the more striking that in subject the
inspiration of both painters is strictly, even though superficially,
theological. But Benozzo cares, in his theology, for nothing but the
story, the scene and the drama--the chance to pile up palaces and spires
in his backgrounds against pale blue skies cross-barred with pearly,
fleecy clouds, and to scatter sculptured arches and shady trellises over
the front, with every incident of human life going forward lightly and
gracefully beneath them. Lightness and grace are the painter’s great
qualities, marking the hithermost limit of unconscious elegance, after
which “style” and science and the wisdom of the serpent set in.
His charm is natural fineness; a little more and we should have
refinement--which is a very different thing. Like all les délicats of
this world, as M. Renan calls them, Benozzo has suffered greatly. The
space on the walls he originally covered with his Old Testament stories
is immense; but his exquisite handiwork has peeled off by the acre,
as one may almost say, and the latter compartments of the series are
swallowed up in huge white scars, out of which a helpless head or hand
peeps forth like those of creatures sinking into a quicksand. As
for Pisa at large, although it is not exactly what one would call
a mouldering city--for it has a certain well-aired cleanness and
brightness, even in its supreme tranquillity--it affects the imagination
very much in the same way as the Campo Santo. And, in truth, a city
so ancient and deeply historic as Pisa is at every step but the
burial-ground of a larger life than its present one. The wide empty
streets, the goodly Tuscan palaces--which look as if about all of them
there were a genteel private understanding, independent of placards,
that they are to be let extremely cheap--the delicious relaxing air,
the full-flowing yellow river, the lounging Pisani, smelling,
metaphorically, their poppy-flowers, seemed to me all so many
admonitions to resignation and oblivion. And this is what I mean by
saying that the charm of Pisa (apart from its cluster of monuments) is
a charm of a high order. The architecture has but a modest dignity; the
lions are few; there are no fixed points for stopping and gaping. And
yet the impression is profound; the charm is a moral charm. If I were
ever to be incurably disappointed in life, if I had lost my health,
my money, or my friends, if I were resigned forevermore to pitching my
expectations in a minor key, I should go and invoke the Pisan peace. Its
quietude would seem something more than a stillness--a hush. Pisa may be
a dull place to live in, but it’s an ideal place to wait for death.

Nothing could be more charming than the country between Pisa and
Lucca--unless possibly the country between Lucca and Pistoia. If Pisa is
dead Tuscany, Lucca is Tuscany still living and enjoying, desiring and
intending. The town is a charming mixture of antique “character” and
modern inconsequence; and! not only the town, but the country--the
blooming romantic country which you admire from the famous promenade
on the city-wall. The wall is of superbly solid and intensely “toned”
 brickwork and of extraordinary breadth, and its summit, planted with
goodly trees and swelling here and there into bastions and outworks and
little open gardens, surrounds the city with a circular lounging-place
of a splendid dignity. This well-kept, shady, ivy-grown rampart reminded
me of certain mossy corners of England; but it looks away to a prospect
of more than English loveliness--a broad green plain where the summer
yields a double crop of grain, and a circle of bright blue mountains
speckled with high-hung convents and profiled castles and nestling
villas, and traversed by valleys of a deeper and duskier blue. In one of
the deepest and shadiest of these recesses one of the most “sympathetic”
 of small watering-places is hidden away yet a while longer from
easy invasion--the Baths to which Lucca has lent its name. Lucca is
pre-eminently a city of churches; ecclesiastical architecture being
indeed the only one of the arts to which it seems to have given
attention. There are curious bits of domestic architecture, but no
great palaces, and no importunate frequency of pictures. The Cathedral,
however, sums up the merits of its companions and is a singularly noble
and interesting church. Its peculiar boast is a wonderful inlaid front,
on which horses and hounds and hunted beasts are lavishly figured in
black marble over a white ground. What I chiefly appreciated in the grey
solemnity of the nave and transepts was the superb effect of certain
second-storey Gothic arches--those which rest on the pavement being
Lombard. These arches are delicate and slender, like those of the
cloister at Pisa, and they play their part in the dusky upper air with
real sublimity.

At Pistoia there is of course a Cathedral, and there is nothing
unexpected in its being, externally at least, highly impressive; in its
having a grand campanile at its door, a gaudy baptistery, in alternate
layers of black and white marble, across the way, and a stately civic
palace on either side. But even had I the space to do otherwise I should
prefer to speak less of the particular objects of interest in the place
than of the pleasure I found it to lounge away in the empty streets the
quiet hours of a warm afternoon. To say where I lingered longest would
be to tell of a little square before the hospital, out of which you
look up at the beautiful frieze in coloured earthernware by the brothers
Della Robbia, which runs across the front of the building. It represents
the seven orthodox offices of charity and, with its brilliant blues and
yellows and its tender expressiveness, brightens up amazingly, to the
sense and soul, this little grey corner of the mediaeval city. Pi stoia
is still mediaeval. How grass-grown it seemed, how drowsy, how full of
idle vistas and melancholy nooks! If nothing was supremely wonderful,
everything was delicious.

OTHER TUSCAN CITIES


I


I had scanted charming Pisa even as I had scanted great Siena in my
original small report of it, my scarce more than stammering notes of
years before; but even if there had been meagreness of mere gaping
vision--which there in fact hadn’t been--as well as insufficiency of
public tribute, the indignity would soon have ceased to weigh on my
conscience. For to this affection I was to return again still oftener
than to the strong call of Siena my eventual frequentations of Pisa, all
merely impressionistic and amateurish as they might be--and I pretended,
up and down the length of the land, to none other--leave me at the
hither end of time with little more than a confused consciousness of
exquisite quality on the part of the small sweet scrap of a place of
ancient glory; a consciousness so pleadingly content to be general and
vague that I shrink from pulling it to pieces. The Republic of Pisa
fought with the Republic of Florence, through the ages so ferociously
and all but invincibly that what is so pale and languid in her to-day
may well be the aspect of any civil or, still more, military creature
bled and bled and bled at the “critical” time of its life. She has
verily a just languor and is touchingly anæmic; the past history, or
at any rate the present perfect acceptedness, of which condition hangs
about her with the last grace of weakness, making her state in this
particular the very secret of her irresistible appeal. I was to find the
appeal, again and again, one of the sweetest, tenderest, even if not
one of the fullest and richest impressions possible; and if I went back
whenever I could it was very much as one doesn’t indecently neglect a
gentle invalid friend. The couch of the invalid friend, beautifully,
appealingly resigned, has been wheeled, say, for the case, into the warm
still garden, and your visit but consists of your sitting beside it with
kind, discreet, testifying silences. Such is the figurative form under
which the once rugged enemy of Florence, stretched at her length by the
rarely troubled Arno, to-day presents herself; and I find my analogy
complete even to my sense of the mere mild séance, the inevitably
tacit communion or rather blank interchange, between motionless cripple
and hardly more incurable admirer.

The terms of my enjoyment of Pisa scarce departed from that ideal--slow
contemplative perambulations, rather late in the day and after work done
mostly in the particular decent inn-room that was repeatedly my portion;
where the sunny flicker of the river played up from below to the very
ceiling, which, by the same sign, anciently and curiously raftered and
hanging over my table at a great height, had been colour-pencilled into
ornament as fine (for all practical purposes) as the page of a missal.
I add to this, for remembrance, an inveteracy of evening idleness and of
reiterated ices in front of one of the quiet cafés--quiet as everything
at Pisa is quiet, or will certainly but in these latest days have ceased
to be; one in especial so beautifully, so mysteriously void of bustle
that almost always the neighbouring presence and admirable chatter of
some group of the local University students would fall upon my ear, by
the half-hour at a time, not less as a privilege, frankly, than as a
clear-cut image of the young Italian mind and life, by which I lost
nothing. I use such terms as “admirable” and “privilege,” in this last
most casual of connections--which was moreover no connection at all but
what my attention made it--simply as an acknowledgment of the interest
that might play there through some inevitable thoughts. These were, for
that matter, intensely in keeping with the ancient scene and air:
they dealt with the exquisite difference between that tone and type of
ingenuous adolescence--in the mere relation of charmed audition--and
other forms of juvenility of whose mental and material accent one had
elsewhere met the assault. Civilised, charmingly civilised, were my
loquacious neighbours--as how had n’t they to be, one asked one’s self,
through the use of a medium of speech that is in itself a sovereign
saturation? There was the beautiful congruity of the happily-caught
impression; the fact of my young men’s general Tuscanism of tongue,
which related them so on the spot to the whole historic consensus
of things. It wasn’t dialect--as it of course easily might have been
elsewhere, at Milan, at Turin, at Bologna, at Naples; it was the clear
Italian in which all the rest of the surrounding story was told, all
the rest of the result of time recorded; and it made them delightful,
prattling, unconscious men of the particular little constituted and
bequeathed world which everything else that was charged with old
meanings and old beauty referred to--all the more that their talk was
never by any chance of romping games or deeds of violence, but kept
flowering, charmingly and incredibly, into eager ideas and literary
opinions and philosophic discussions and, upon my honour, vital
questions.

They have taken me too far, for so light a reminiscence; but I claim
for the loose web of my impressions at no point a heavier texture. Which
comes back to what I was a moment ago saying--that just in proportion
as you “feel” the morbid charm of Pisa you press on it gently, and this
somehow even under stress of whatever respectful attention. I found
this last impulse, at all events, so far as I was concerned, quite
contentedly spend itself in a renewed sense of the simple large pacified
felicity of such an afternoon aspect as that of the Lung’ Arno, taken up
or down its course; whether to within sight of small Santa Maria della
Spina, the tiny, the delicate, the exquisite Gothic chapel perched where
the quay drops straight, or, in the other direction, toward the melting
perspective of the narrow local pleasure-ground, the rather thin and
careless bosky grace of which recedes, beside the stream whose very
turbidity pleases, to a middle distance of hot and tangled and exuberant
rural industry and a proper blue horizon of Carrara mountains. The Pisan
Lung’ Arno is shorter and less featured and framed than the Florentine,
but it has the fine accent of a marked curve and is quite as bravely
Tuscan; witness the type of river-fronting palace which, in half-a-dozen
massive specimens, the last word of the anciently “handsome,” are of
the essence of the physiognomy of the place. In the glow of which
retrospective admission I ask myself how I came, under my first flush,
reflected in other pages, to fail of justice to so much proud domestic
architecture--in the very teeth moreover of the fact that I was for ever
paying my compliments, in a wistful, wondering way, to the fine Palazzo
Lanfranchi, occupied in 1822 by the migratory Byron, and whither Leigh
Hunt, as commemorated in the latter’s Autobiography, came out to join
him in an odd journalistic scheme.

Of course, however, I need scarcely add, the centre of my daily
revolution--quite thereby on the circumference--was the great Company of
Four in their sequestered corner; objects of regularly recurrent pious
pilgrimage, if for no other purpose than to see whether each would
each time again so inimitably carry itself as one of a group of
wonderfully-worked old ivories. Their charm of relation to each other
and to everything else that concerns them, that of the quartette of
monuments, is more or less inexpressible all round; but not the least of
it, ever, is in their beautiful secret for taking at different hours
and seasons, in different states of the light, the sky, the wind, the
weather--in different states, even, it used verily to seem to me, of
an admirer’s imagination or temper or nerves--different complexional
appearances, different shades and pallors, different glows and chills.
I have seen them look almost viciously black, and I have seen them as
clear and fair as pale gold. And these things, for the most part, off on
the large grassy carpet spread for them, and with the elbow of the old
city-wall, not elsewhere erect, respectfully but protectingly crooked
about, to the tune of a usual unanimity save perhaps in the case of
the Leaning Tower--so abnormal a member of any respectable family this
structure at best that I always somehow fancied its three companions,
the Cathedral, the Baptistery and the Campo Santo, capable of quiet
common understandings, for the major or the minor effect, into which
their odd fellow, no hint thrown out to him, was left to enter as he
might. If one haunted the place, one ended by yielding to the conceit
that, beautifully though the others of the group may be said to behave
about him, one sometimes caught them in the act of tacitly combining to
