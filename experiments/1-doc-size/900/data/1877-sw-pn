" ' And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white 
horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge 
and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, 
and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a 
name written, that no man knew, but he himself. 
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : 
and his name is called, The Word of God. And 
the armies which were in heaven followed him upon 
white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. 
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that 
with it he should smite the nations ; and he shall 
rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the 
wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty 
God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh 
a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD 
OF LORDS. 

" 'And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and 
he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls 
that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather 



 

yourselves together unto the supper of the great 
God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the 
flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and 
the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, 
and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both 
small and great. 

" 'And I saw the beast, and the kings of the 
earth, and their armies, gathered together to make 
war against him that sat on the horse, and against 
his army. And the beast was taken, and with 
him the false prophet that wrought miracles before 
him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that wor 
shipped his image. These both were cast alive 
into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And 
the remnant were slain with the sword of him that 
sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of 
his mouth:. and all the fowls were tilled with their 
flesh.'" 

" I do not understand all that, the least bit," said 
Flora. 

"You understand there will be a war, and a 
battle?" 

" But that's a figure." 

" No, it's a fact. How should it be a figure ? " 

" What do you understand by a ' sword proceed 
ing out of his mouth ? ' " 

" That is in the description of Christ in the first 
chapter: 'And he had in his right hand seven 
stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two- 
edged sword.'" 



 

" Well, isn't that a figure ? What does it mean ? " 

" Listen to the description of Christ that Isaiah 
gives: 'With righteousness shall he judge the poor, 
and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth ; 
and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his 
mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay 
the wicked.' " 

"Well?" 

"And in Thessalonians ; 'Then shall that Wicked 
be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with 
the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the 
brightness of his coming.' And in Ephesians: 'the 
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.' " 

"Well," said Flora, "that is not a real sword, 
with a handle, and an edge." 

" The Bible says it has two edges." 

" Nonsense ! you know what I mean." 

" I know. Certainly Flora, the weapons of that 
battle may not be weapons of flesh and blood, or 
for flesh and blood ; but the battle, is real, don't you 
see? and the awful overthrow and destruction; 
and what I am wondering about is, how those old 
Saxons knew there would be such a battle at the 
end ? and how they knew that the mischief would 
in some sense come from the devil." 

"Did they know it?" 

" The wolf Fenris was one of the devil's children, 
as they made it out. And another was the serpent 
which Odin cast into the sea, where it grew and 
grew till it had wound up the whole earth in its 
folds. That is very curious ! " 
 



 

"What, Ditto?" 

" How did they know that ? " 

"Know what?" 

"Why, don't you see? The serpent is one of 
the Bible words for the devil; here it is a child 
of the devil; who coming to the earth has enveloped the whole world in his toils. The Bible 
says, I know, somewhere, that those who are not 
saved by Christ are 4 m the Wicked one.' How 
did they know so much, and so little, those old 
people ? " 

"Where did you find all those Bible verses just 
now about the sword, Ditto ? " 

"References here, Maggie." 

"Well, go on, Ditto. There were three children 
of the devil." 

" The third was the goddess Hel or Hela. She 
was the goddess of the lower world; and was half 
black and half blue. I wonder! that must be 
where our word 'hell' comes from. What dreadful old times ! And times now are just as bad, for 
a great part of the world. The goddess Hel was 
very like the horrible Hindoo goddess Kali, they 
say here." 

" I don't believe those times were so much worse 
than these times," said Flora. 

" You think human sacrifices are a pleasant religious feature ? " 

" Not to the victims ; but I suppose the rest were 
all accustomed to it, and didn't feel so shocked as 
you do." 



 

"Landolf seems to have been a good deal 
shocked." 

"Are you going to read us any thing more, 
Ditto, about those queer old gods?" 

"There isn't much more that I need read, Maggie. 
I have told you about the principal deities. They 
believed in quantities of lesser ones really, personifications of the good and evil powers of nature. The 
elves and their king, and the dwarfs living inside 
the hills. The dwarfs owned the treasures of the 
mines, and worked in metals and precious stones." 

"I should like to believe in elves and fairies," 
said Flora. 

"Why?" 

"0 it's pretty and poetical. Fairy rings and all 
that." 

"Would you like to think there were hidden 
powers in every piece of water, and rock, and hill, 
which might feel kindly disposed towards you and 
might not ? which might suddenly play you an ill 
trick and make you most mischievous trouble, for 
nothing but mischief? " 

" Did people believe so, Ditto ? " 

"Certainly. A great many people, in various 
parts of the world." 

"I would rather believe that God has it all in 
his hand," said Maggie contentedly. 

" So would I, Maggie. And that Jesus has the 
keys of hell and of death." 

" I wonder when Fenton will be here," remarked 
Esther. 



 

" I hope he won't come till Uncle Eden gets 
here," said Maggie very deliberately. 

" Why not ? " said Esther sharply. 

" He is uneasy," said Maggie with a corresponding shrug of her shoulders; "I never know what 
Fenton will take it into his head to do." 

" That is a nice way to speak of your brother." 

Maggie considered that. " I can't find'any nicer," 
she said at length. 

"Then I wouldn't speak at all." 

" Never mind," said Flora. " One's brothers are 
always a mixture of comfort and plague. And 
that is true of the best of them, Esther ; you never 
know what they will take into their heads to do." 

" 0, Flora ! " Maggie began, and stopped. 

" You think there is a difference between brothers 
and brothers," said Flora laughing. "Well, my 
experience is what I tell you." 

"Ditto," said Maggie suddenly, "are there any 
such stones as those queer stone-houses in this 
country ? " 

" Not that ever I heard of, Maggie. But in the 
old world, as it is called, there are a great many, 
scattered over a great many countries. Not all 
just like the stone-houses. Some are just single 
stones set up on end. Some are two laid together, 
one resting on the other slantwise ; the stone-houses 
in Luneburg seem to have been made of nine stones, 
one lying on eight." 

"Did people offer human sacrifices on all of 
them?" 



 

" I fancy not. But I believe it is tolerably un 
certain. Did you never see a picture of Stone- 
henge ? " 

Maggie knew nothing about Stonehenge. Meredith went to the bookcases again and got another 
volume. This contained many illustrations of old 
stone monuments of various kinds, and he and 
Maggie were soon absorbed in studying them. 

" There ! " cried Maggie, as he opened at one of 
the earliest illustrations, "there, Ditto! that is very 
like very like what you read of the stone-houses. 
Isn't it?" 

" Fearfully like," said Meredith. " This is in Ireland. I dare say some of those old Druids sacrificed men on it." 

" How could they set it up so ? Look, Ditto 
the top stone rests just on one point at the lowest 
end. I should think it would topple down." 

"It has stood hundreds of years, Maggie, and will 
stand for all time unless an earthquake shakes it 
down. This Dolmen is made of four stones." 

"What is a dolmen?" 

"This is one. It says here in a note, that the 
name comes 'from the Celtic word Daul, a table, 
and Chen or Chaen, a stone.' A stone table. And 
it says here that there are probably a hundred of 
such dolmens in Great Britain and Ireland. How 
ever did the builders get that enormous block 
poised on the tips of the other three ? " 

Slowly and absorbedly the two went on exploring the pages of the book ; stopping to read, stopping to talk and discuss the questions of tumuli 
and stone circles, dolmens and menhirs. The opinion of the author, that the great circles commemorated great battles, and were raised in honour of 
the dead buried within them ; and that many dolmens had a sepulchral character; was somewhat 
confusing to the Druidical and tragical impressions 
left from the Saxon chronicle; which, however, at 
last got an undeniable support. In the stones of 
Stennis, over which Maggie and Meredith pon 
dered with intense interest, one of the enormous 
up-standing masses has a hole through it. And 
this stone, there is no doubt, was dedicated to Woden. And so long had the superstition of Woden's 
worship clung to it, that until very lately an oath 
sworn by persons joining their hands through this 
hole, was reckoned especially sacred ; even the 
courts of law so recognizing it. After that, Woden seemed to Maggie to have strong claim to all 
the upright stones and altar-looking dolmens that 
are found where the worship of Woden has once 
prevailed. Leaving Stennis they went on to Kunic crosses, German dolmens, and French dolmens, and 
on and on, from country to country. When at last 
they lifted up their heads and looked around them, 
they were alone. The girls had gone off to bed; 
the worsted work lay, left on the table; the fire 
was out, the minute-hand pointed to ten o'clock. 
Meredith and Maggie glanced at each other and 
smiled. 

"We have forgotten ourselves," said he. 



 

"You see, Ditto," said Maggie, "we've been travelling. I wish I could see the Stones of Stennis, 
don't you? and the Stone of Woden ! " 

" Well, now you had better travel to bed, little 
one, and forget it all. Don't see it in your dreams." 



 



CHAPTER VI. 

One expects steady weather in October; so it 
was really not extraordinary that the next morning should break fair and quiet, with a sunny haze 
lying over the river. Nevertheless Maggie rejoiced. 

"What a pleasant day we had yesterday!" she 
exclaimed, as the party sat at breakfast. 

"Are not all your days pleasant?" said Meredith. 

"Yes, but yesterday was uncommon. Ditto, 
we didn't look at the map last night ! " 

"We were looking at stones." 

" Yes, but we must look at the map after breakfast. I want to find all those places." 

" Take time," said Meredith, "and eat your breakfast. Liineburg heath will not run away." 

But after breakfast indeed the great atlas was 
fetched out to the sunny terrace in front of the 
house and laid on a settee, and Maggie and Meredith sat down before the map of Germany with 
business faces. 

" Now here is the Elbe," said Maggie, " it is big 
enough to be seen ; here is the mouth of it, just in 



 

a corner under Denmark, where those ships went 
from." 

"What ships?" 

"Why, the ships in which the Saxons went over 
to England the Saxons that conquered England, 
Meredith." 

"You do remember," said Meredith smiling. "It 
is worth while, reading to you." 

" They sailed from the mouths of the Elbe and 
the Weser and here is the Weser. The mouths 
are pretty near together. Now between the Elbe 
and the Weser were which Saxons, Ditto ? " 

"Towards the Elbe and beyond it, were the East- 
phalians ; those our story belongs to ; among whom 
Landolf went." 

"Well here is the Aller, Ditto! they lived there, 
you know; that is pretty far west. And here is 
Hermannsburg ! I am glad we have found that. 
And here is Liineburg all over here, I suppose. 
I suppose we couldn't find the stone-houses, Ditto . " 

"I suppose not. But here is Verden on the Aller, Maggie, where Charlemagne had those 4,500 
Saxons hewed to pieces. And here are Osnabruck 
and Detmold, where the Saxons beat him again 
and took the 4,000 captives that they slew at the 
stone-houses." 

" Horrid Charlemagne ! " said Maggie. 

" It was all horrid, what concerned the fighting. 
But here is Minden, Maggie, from which good Lan 
dolf set out in his little boat and dropped down the 
Weser to go to the East Saxons." 



 

" And then when he got to the Aller he went up 
that; then he had to row hard, I guess." 

"I guess he did a good deal of hard rowing, first 
and last, Maggie." 

"Then to get to the stone-houses he went further 
up the Aller and turned into the Oerze. Here is 
the Oerze ! Then the stone-houses must be some 
where hereabouts, Ditto ; for they are not very far 
from Hermannsburg." 

"There is the little river Wieze, Maggie; and 
here, where it flows into the Oerze, was that oak 
wood, sacred to Thor, where the village of Miiden 
now is. And here is the village of Munster where 
Freija was honoured. All over the land then 
it was wild country, woods and morasses. And 
now think what Germany is ! " 

" What is it, Ditto ? " 

" It is the land of Thought, and Art, and Learning, and Criticism." 

" Look here ! " broke in a lively voice behind 
them. " Do you know the sun is getting up in the 
sky ? and we have settled nothing. And here are 
two heads over a map ! " 

" It would not hurt a third head," said Meredith. 
"And Maggie and I have settled a good deal, 
thank you." 

"But where are we going to-day ? " 

"Yes," added Esther behind, "where are we 
going? I think it is time to be getting ready, 
because it takes us a good while." 

" Esther," said Maggie, " Fairbairn and the men 



 

are going over to the pine terrace to cut down some 
trees papa wants cut; let us go there and have a 
big bonfire, and then Ditto will have plenty of 
coals for his friar's omelet." 

" Betsey is making us a chicken pie." 
" Well, the omelet will do no harm besides." 
" No. It is a good way over to the pine terrace." 
" I don't care how far it is. So much the better. 
It is nice walking. Do you care, Flora ? " 

" She don't care," said Meredith. " Come, let us 
load up. If we have a journey before us, best be 
about it." 

" And then, Esther," Maggie went on, " we can 
go to the Lookout rock to read." 
" It will be sunny there." 

" Well, it's all nice on the pine terrace, and we 
can find plenty of shade. Now then, Ditto if 
you'll bring up the wagon." 

The business of loading up began. There were 
always some varieties eveiy time. To-day a basket 
of sweet potatoes formed one item, going to be 
roasted in the great fire-heap which would be left 
from the bonfire. A great chicken pie, fresh and 
hot, was carefully wrapped up and put in. Meredith provided a hatchet, to trim branches with. 
Worsted work and afghan of course ; but the only 
book was in Meredith's pocket The cart was quite 
loaded when all was done; for you know, cups and 
saucers and plates weigh heavy, if you put enough 
of them together, and the chicken pie in the dish 
was a matter of a good many pounds, and potatoes 



 

are heavy too. Somebody had to carry the bottle 
of cream, and Fairbairn went laden with a pail of 
water. 

The day was just another like the day before, 
but the direction of the walk was different. The 
; party turned to the left instead of to the right, and 
leaving the flower-beds and shrubbery, entered a 
pretty winding road which curled about through a 
grove of red cedars. The air was spicy, dry and 
warm. A soft, rather thick haze filled the air, 
turning the whole world into a sort of fairy-land. 
The hills looked misty, the river still and dreamy; 
outlines were softened, colours were grown tender. 
The happy little party, it is true, gave not much 
heed to this bewitchment of nature, with the one 
exception of Meredith ; Flora and Esther were in a 
contented state of practical well-being which had 
no sentiment in it; Maggie and her dog were a 
pair, for jocund spirits and thoughtless delight- 
taking. They both went bounding about, very 
much taken up with each other; while Meredith 
pulled the cart steadily on and feasted mentally on 
every step of the way. The road brought them 
soon to the neighbourhood of the river again, and 
ran along a grassy bank which sloped gently down 
to the edge of the water. The green sward was 
dotted with columnar red cedars, growing to a 
height of thirty feet, with a diameter of two or 
two and a half all the way, straight as a pillar. 
On the other hand a low, rocky height grown with 
oaks and hemlocks overhung the valley, and the 



 

rocky ridge seemed to sweep round to the front of 
them in a wide amphitheatre, giving a sky line 
of variegated colour, soft and glowing under the 
haze. Travelling on, they got next into a wood 
and lost the river. Here all was wild; the ground 
strewn with rock and encumbered with low growth 
of huckleberry bushes, brambles, and ferns. The 
road however was good, and Meredith drew the cart 
without any difficulty. After a time the ground be 
gan to rise, for in fact they were approaching the 
further end of the rocky ridge before mentioned, 
where it swept round to the river. Midway of the 
height the hill shelved into a wide plateau or ter 
race; at the back of it the sharp, rocky hill-side, 
in front of it a green slope leading down to the 
river. The ground on the plateau was gravelly 
and poor; it gave foothold to little beside white 
and yellow pines, which in places stood thick, in 
other places parted and opened for spaces of mossy 
turf, where the too shallow soil would not nourish them. Here there was a wild wilderness of 
natural beauty. Now and then a lovely low-growing white pine spreading abroad its bluish-green 
branches; in other parts scraggy, tall-shooting specimens of the yellow variety ; at the hill foot and 
on the rocky hill-side golden hickories and brown 
oaks and flaunting maples. The turf was dry and 
warm, being in fact half moss; the openings and 
glades allured the party from one sweet resting 
spot into another. 

" We may as well stop here," said Flora at last. 



 

" We might go round and round all day, it is all 
so pretty. We must stop somewhere, if we are to 
have any reading." 

" Let us go over yonder to the edge of the bank," 
said Meredith, " where we can have a view of the 
river." 

At the edge of the bank the cedars began to oc 
cupy the ground and indeed hindered the view; 
but a few strokes of Fairbairn's axe set that right ; 
and the party sat down in the shade of some taller 
trees with a lookout over the pretty conical cedars 
(not columnar here) down to the water, and across 
to the green and gold promontory which on the 
other side of the river closed the view. The girls 
got out their work. Maggie sat down panting after 
a race with Kob Koy. Meredith lounged upon the 
mossy bank and looked lazy. Presently the strokes 
of a couple of axes began to break the silence. One, 
two; one, two; one, two 

" It only wanted that ! " he exclaimed. 

"What! "said Esther. 

"That chopping. That ring of the axes. It 
completes the charm. This is elysium ! " 

" We have got to make our bonfire ! " said Maggie starting. 

"Wait, not yet; they have not cut down a single tree yet. Hark ! there it goes, crashing down. 
They have got to trim it yet, Maggie, before there 
will be anything to burn." 

"And they must cut and trim a good many 
trees, before there will be enough to begin," said 



 

Esther. " It is more fun to have plenty to pile on 
at once." 

" Then we shall wait a good while for our din 
ner," said Maggie. 

" Are you hungry ? It is only half past eleven." 

"No, I am not hungry yet; but a bonfire takes a 
good while, you know, and I want to get to the 
reading." 

" Come ! we might read an hour," said Meredith 
rousing himself up. 

"No, Ditto, that would bring it to half past 
twelve, and that would never do." 

"Well then I will go trim, and we'll have the 
bonfire going in a few minutes. Where will you 
have it?" 

Maggie sought out a good spot, while Meredith 
took his hatchet and went to work, clearing the 
lopped branches of their smaller leafy twigs which 
were for the fire, and cutting in two the branches 
which were not worth trimming. There was a 
nice piece of work then, to drag them to the bonfire place ; for it was needful to choose an open, free 
space for making the fire, where the flames would 
not mount or be blown into the tops of trees that 
were to be left standing, and so scorch and injure 
them. No such open space was at command in 
the close neighbourhood of the cutting; so the 
stuff for the fire had to be transported some distance. Maggie and Meredith worked away at it, 
and Maggie called Esther and Meredith summoned 
Flora to help ; and soon they were all heartily engaged and running to and fro with armfuls, or 
dragging behind them on the ground the heavy 
umbrageous branches they might not cany. Presently Meredith stopped and collected a little bunch 
of dry sticks and leaves which he heaped together; 
tucked paper under, and laid crisp hemlock and 
cedar cuttings on top. Then a match was kindled 
and fire applied. They all watched to see it; light 
ing, crackling, smoking, then the slender upshoot 
of flame and Meredith began to pile on pine 
branches thick and fast. At first rose a thick column of smoke, for the fuel was fat and resinous 
and the fire had not got under way. Kedoubling, 
soft, black and brown reeking curls, through which 
the sun shot his beams here and there lighting 
them up to golden amber. " What tints and what 
forms ! " Meredith exclaimed. And then another 
light and another colour began to come into the 
others; tiny up-darting shoots of 'fire, another illumination rivalling and contrasting with the sun 
light which struck the column higher up. Meredith stood still to watch it, while even Flora and 
Esther were dragging more branches of yellow 
pine to the fire and throwing them on emulously, 
till the pile grew and grew, and Maggie was working her cheeks into a purple state with her exertions. Half a dozen thick pine branches flung 
on, and the fire would be stifled and the smoke 
rise thicker and blacker, with the sunlight always 
catching the upper curls; then crackling and snapping and breathing, the fire would get hold, get 



 

the better, mount through the thick, encumbering 
piney foliage, and dart its slender living spires up 
into the column of smoke again. 

"Do see how he stands!" cried Flora. "Ditto, 
why don't you work?" 

"I am looking." 

"Did you never see a bonfire before?" 

"Never such a beauty of a one." 

"Beauty?" said Flora, coming to his side to look 
"where is the beauty? It is just a good fire. 
You are a ridiculous boy, Meredith. Go to work." 

"0 don't you think it is pretty?" cried Maggie, 
throwing down her last burden and panting. "I 
think it is lovely ! And do you smell how sweet it 
is, Flora?" 

"She is a poor girl without nose or eyes," said 
Meredith. " Well, here goes ! " 

Taking hold of the work again, his powerful 
arms flung the branches and tops of pine on the 
burning heap, while the girls ran for more. It 
took a strong arm now, for the fire was so large 
and so fierce that one could not come nigh it. 
Meredith kept the girls all at a distance and himself fed the flames ; till all the present stock of fuel 
was laid on, and the wood-choppers went off to 
their dinner. There was no more to be done then 
but to watch the show, and as the fire began to 
lessen and die down, find a spot where the tea 
kettle might be set, at the edge of the glowing 
heap. It was no use to begin to read, they all 
agreed, till they had their dinner. And soon the 




 

coffee could be made; and the four enjoyed their 
meal as only those can who have worked for it. 
They had their chicken pie and their roasted sweet 
potatoes; the omelet they for to-day dispensed with, 
being all tired. They took their dinner on the 
bank, there where they could look away down to 
the river and see the hilly shores beyond on the 
other side ; and Meredith averred that sweet pota 
toes never were so sweet before. 

"Such air!" said he. "And such colouring." 

"And it is just warm enough," added Maggie. 

"Well, I have got cooled off now," said Flora; 
"but I consider feeding bonfires to be hot work." 

Then, when dinner was over, and the things 
packed into the cart, they arranged themselves on 
the moss in a delicious feeling of resting and refreshed languor; the girls took out their fancy work, 
and .Meredith opened his book. Maggie, who did 
not trouble herself about fancy work, crept close to 
his side and looked with fascinated eyes at the 
strange characters out of which he brought such 
delightful things to her ears. 

"'It was about the year 940, according to the 
chronicle, that a boy of thirteen or fourteen years 
old was herding his father's cattle on the wasteland not far from Hermannsburg; when there came 
along a splendid train of armed cavaliers riding 
their horses proudly. The boy looks with delight 
on the shining helmets and coats of mail, the 
glittering spears and the stately horsemen, and the 
thought rises in his heart "Now that looks something like!" All of a sudden the horsemen quit 
the road, which here wound about crookedly, and 
come riding across country, over the open land 
where he is keeping his cattle. That seems to 
him too bad, for the field is no highway, and the 
ground belongs to his father. He considers a moment, then goes forward to meet the riders, plants 
himself in their course, and calls out to them 
"Turn back! the road is yours, the field is mine." 
There is a tall man riding at the head of the troop, 
on whose brow a grave majesty is enthroned; he 
looks wonderingly at the boy who has dared to 
put himself in his way. He checks his horse, taking a certain pleasure in the spirited little fellow, 
who returns his look so boldly and fearlessly and 
never budges from his place. 

"'Who are you, boy?" 

'"I am Hermann Billing's oldest son; and my 
name is Hermann too, and this field is my father's, 
and you must not ride over it." 

 " But I will, boy," answered the rider with 
threatening sternness. "Get out of the way, or 
I throw you down " and with that he lifts his 
spear. The boy, however, stands fearlessly still, 
looks up at the horseman with eyes of fire and 
says 

" ' " Right is right; and you have no business to 
ride over this field; you shall ride over me if you 
do." 

 "What do you know about the right, boy?" 

 " My father is the Billing, and I shall be Billing after him," answered the boy, "and nobody 
may do a wrong before a Billing." 

'"Then still more threateningly the rider called 
out "Is this right then, boy, to refuse obedience 
to your king? I am your king, Otto." 

"'You Otto? our king? the shield of Germany 
and the flower of the Saxons, that my father tells 
us so much about? Otto the son of Heinrich 
the Saxon? No, that you are not. Otto the king 
guards the right, and you are doing the wrong. 
Otto don't do that, my father says." 

 " Take me to your father, my good boy," answered the king; and an unwonted gentleness and 
kindliness beamed upon his stern face. 

"'Yonder is my father's dwelling-house, you 
can see it," said Hermann; "but my father has 
trusted the cattle here to me and I cannot leave 
them, so I cannot bring you there. But if you 
are King Otto, turn off" out of the field into the 
road; for the king guards the law." 

"'And King Otto the first, surnamed the Great, 
obeyed the boy's voice, for the boy was in the 
right, and rode back to the road. Presently Hermann was fetched from the field. The king had 
gone into his father's house and had said to him, 
"Billing, give me your oldest son and let him go 
with me ; I will have him brought up at court ; he 
is going to be a true man, and I have need of true 
men." And what true Saxon could refuse any 
thing to a king like Otto? 

" ' So the brave boy was to journey forward with 



 

his king, and when Otto asked him, "Hermann 
will yon go with me?" the boy answered gladly, 
" I will go with you ; you are the king, for you 
protect the right." 

"'So King Otto took the boy along with him, 
that he might have him brought up to be a faithful 
and capable servant of the crown. Otto was allied 
in the bonds of warmest friendship with Adaldag, 
the archbishop of Bremen, a man who was distinguished for his learning, his piety, and a lively 
zeal for the spread of Christianity among the then 
heathen Danes and Norsemen. Otto could not confide the boy who had become so dear to him to a 
better teacher; and so he sent him to Adaldag at 
Bremen. Adaldag, too, recognized the great gifts 
which God had bestowed on the boy, and had him 
instructed under his own eye by the most able ecclesiastics; among whom a certain Raginbrand is 
especially named, who later was appointed to be 
bishop and preacher to the heathen in Denmark, 
and laboured there with great faithfulness and a 
great blessing. In Bremen Hermann grew up to 
be a good young man, loving his Saviour from his 
heart; but also he was instructed in the use of 
arms and in the business of the state, for Adaldag 
was at that time one of King Otto's most confidential advisers. And now Otto took the young Hermann into his court; and soon could perceive that 
he had not deceived himself when his acuteness 
discerned the boy's lofty nature. Spirit, daring, 
and keen intelligence, shot in fire from the young 



 

man's blue eyes ; his uncommonly fine figure had 
been grandly developed by knightly exercises ; and 
with all that, he was so humble-hearted and attached to his benefactor with such grateful, touching devotion, that Otto's eyes rested on him with 
pleasure, and he often called Hermann his truest 
friend, even called him " his son." But the loveliest thing in Hermann was, that he never forgot his 
origin ; he shewed the most charming kindness to 
those who were poor and mean ; so that high and 
low at the king's court respected as much as they 
loved him. So he mounted from step to step, was 
dubbed a knight, attended the king on his journeys and campaigns, and the king even entrusted 
to him the education of his two sons Wilhelm and 
Ludolf. Still later he administered the most important offices of state to the satisfaction of the 
king; and often travelled through the country of 
the Saxons as Graf, i. e,, a judge. 

" ' That is: The judgment of criminal cases, or the 
tribunal of life and death, in the whole German fatherland was vested in the king alone. Therefore 
at certain times the royal judges made a progress 
through the entire German country. They were 
called Graiven, from the word graw or grau' (that 
means, 'grey,' Maggie) because ordinarily old, experienced, eminent men were chosen for the office. 
These courts for cases of life and death were holdeir by the Grafs under the open sky, in public, and 
in full daylight, so that the judgment pronounced 
could be at once carried into execution. Our 



 

chronicle takes this occasion to relate a story 
about our Hermann Billing, which sets in a clear 
light the pure character of this admirable man. In 
his journey ings as Graf, he came also to his native 
place, to Harm's ouden dorp. It was then long 
after his father's death ; and as head of the family 
he had distributed his seven manor-farms, as fiefs, 
partly to his brothers, partly to other near relations. The great honours to which Hermann had 
been elevated had become the ruin of these men ; 
they behaved themselves proudly towards their 
neighbours, and even took unrighteous ways to enlarge their boundaries, secure in the belief that no 
one would dare to call them in question about 
it, whilst they had such a powerful brother and 
kinsman. Now when Hermann, after the accustomed fashion, was holding the criminal court on 
the Graivenberg (where now the graven farm lies, 
half an hour from Hermannsburg) there presented 
himself a certain Conrad, a freiling, that is, a free 
man ; and accused the holders of Hermann's fiefs, 
that they had by violent and unjust means taken 
from him half his farm and joined it to their own 
estates. 

" ' Hermann's face, at other times so gentle and 
kind, grew dark, and with deep sadness but with a
