ernment, and owns a big plantation. And Manuel can 
have his pick of some of the best girls,” she was re- 
gardful of the feelings of those she liked, so she would 
not say, “richest.” 

“Then I wish he had selected one of them,” Angel 
answered, quickly. 

“But why not you, cherie? You are old enough to 
marry. And such opportunities do not come every day. 
Fie would adore you. Everything would be yours.” 

“He is Spanish, and I am French.” 

“Ah, yes, he knew that. As if it could make any 
difference. Some of the best Spanish blood has been 





mated with the Creole, and it makes a fine race. Because 
Spain and France so often cross sword’s points, that is 
not to say we in the New World should quarrel. He 
is kind and generous of heart, and has a well-governed, 
aflPable temper. Little one, reconsider. It is throwing 
away such a chance as may not come again.” 

“Madame, I do not want to marry at present.” 

“But the years run away fast, and nothing is more 
attractive than youth. There is an old proverb : ‘She 
who will not enter the golden gate when she may, too 
often finds it shut when she would.’ ” 

“I am not looking for the golden gate. I cannot leave 
my aunt and Sylvie at present, especially now that Ger- 
vaise will go.” 

“Perhaps it is best to be satisfied ; but I am afraid he 
will not bring back any tidings. Manuel would have 
been very good to thee, and waited.” 

“But I did not prefer him, even. They are all alike 
to me. I thank you for so much, Madame. We owe 
nearly all our pleasures to you ; and I am truly sorry to 
grieve you. But I do not mean to think of lovers yet.” 

“Thou art too pretty not to have them think of thee.” 

Angelique wondered why she should feel so cold- 
hearted, when she enjoyed all youthful pleasures so 
keenly. What was she hoping for if Hugh de Brienne 
was found? She was not much more than a child that 
happy year when he had been her friend and companion. 
And he did belong to another. She had no right to de- 
mand even the old friendship of him. But what strange 
complications might ensue if Sylvie persisted in her be- 
lief that she had been truly married to Gervaise ! 

Sylvie kept the secret well, not even making any al- 
lusion to it. But Aunt Melanie heard it, and wondered 




that Madame Champe could uphold a girl in such foolish- 
ness when so fine an offer of marriage was made her. 

“She was not a bit in love with him, Aunt; that was 
plain to be seen,” remarked Henri. “She is not thinking 
of marriage, truly.” 

“Then it is time she was. To let slip a chance like 
that ! And he in the government employ !” 

Henri gave a curious little laugh. He had heard the 
whispers that, after all, Spain was not so secure. If the 
province should be turned over to France again! There 
was only one drawback. The First Consul had ex- 
pressed himself strongly against slavery, and that would 
ruin the country. Still, French preference was intense. 

So Hortense, running about the garden with Sylvie, 
shook her bit of gossip out of her news net ; and then 
Sylvie felt that, in some way, she had been defrauded of 
a triumph. 

“She is not going to marry any one. She has to stay 
with us until Gervaise comes back.” 

“But it would be dreadful for her to be an old maid ; 
such a pretty girl, too. Aunt Melanie thought of going 
into a convent. She was very religious. Then papa wanted 
her to come and take charge of the house, and she did. 
But I do not think Aunt Melanie ever could have been 
pretty.” 

“Angel is coming to live with me,” Sylvie said, proudly. 
“Ah, she had a secret that Hortense could not know.” 

“When you go back to France?” 

Sylvie nodded. 

“Oh, I shall be so sorry! But then I am older, and 
may have a lover of my own. Lucie Fleurien married, 
and went to Havana. Oh, what a grand wedding she 
had ! All the paths were strewn with flowers ; I mean to 




be married that way. Ah, if one could have a lover like 
the Count; but then he is very poor, and his people are 
no longer on the throne. I like a king best, don’t you ?” 

Sylvie was not at all sure. And she was glad Claire 
Lavalette liked the Count so well. Gervaise could not 
be always with her. 

As for Zenobie, she and Sylvie did not make much 
headway in friendship. 

“What you can see about the little child,” she said, 
loftily, to Hortense, “surprises me. A girl who nurses 
a crane and who is likely to grow up an ignoramus seems 
of very little account. Because she has long golden 
hair ” 

“She is not an ignoramus ! She can begin to talk quite 
well in Spanish; and she sews prettily. She can even 
embroider, and make lace. And they have some French 
poets they read aloud — she can repeat whole verses from 
them. Angel teaches her.” 

“Oh, Mam’selle Angelique is very grand, I believe. 
No doubt she is setting her cap for one of the Princes. 
Nothing less than a Prince will do.” 

Zenobie tossed her head. 

“That is very mean of you.” Hortense’s dark eyes 
flashed. 

“I suppose you are quite ready to put her in my place ! 
I can find another friend. But I did not think it of you, 
Hortense, when we have known each other all our lives!” 

There was a touch of upbraiding in the tone, and a 
certain pathos in the voice. They often had differences 
about one thing and another. 

“It is not that at all. We go to school and church 
together, and we are both Catholics. Father Moras said 
she was a heretic,” and the girl’s voice sank to a whisper. 
“So I pray for her every night, that she may be converted 




to the true faith. And he said it would be a most ex- 
cellent thing to get her to school to the nuns. When I 
am trying to follow the good priest's advice, it is very 
cruel in you to torment me.’' 

“But you love her.’' 

“She is very sweet.” 

“Oh, well, go on, then. Perhaps you are in love with 
Gervaise too !” 

“Zenobie Lavalette, I have half a mind never to speak 
to you again !” 

But they did speak the very next day. They could not 
keep angry very long. 

Everybody was asked up to the birthday of Gra’mere 
Lavalette, and the young Princes paid her the compliment 
of going. She was ninety-eight now, and they hoped she 
would live to be a hundred. She had been one of the 
King’s maids sent over to the colonies for wives for the 
men settlers — girls of the better class. She still had 
her little casket, or trunk, and one of the gowiis she wore, 
so faded by age that it seemed a soft gray, with indistinct 
flowers. 

Gra’mere was pillowed up in a great high-backed chair 
that had come from France fifty years before, and was 
rich in carven lilies and clamps of brass, much tarnished, 
though the strong hands of Olympie did their best to keep 
them bright — but the air was too moist. She was a large 
woman, with a good admixture of Indian blood — sold as 
a slave, having been captured in one of the battles be- 
tween the whites and Indians. Once she had made her 
escape; but when she heard gra’mere lay very ill, she 
had gone back of her own accord, and had a strange 
affection for the little withered-up woman who had once 
been such a beauty that Pierre Lavalette, a man of means, 
and holding an office under the Royal Government, made 




her an offer of his heart and hand, and took her to his 
home, very comfortable and quite fine for those days. 
And now M. Lavalette was the third in the line, and 
proud enough of his ancestry. 

She had always been rather petite — this pretty, 
courageous, Jeanne Lavalette, with dark shining hair, 
great black eyes, and bright pink cheeks, in those days. 
There had been many trials to live through — fierce Indian 
attacks — and in the wars at different times she had lost 
her five sons. One only had been married — the father of 
the present Pierre. 

And now she had shrunk year by year. The beautiful 
hair had grown snowy-white, and the little that was left 
was gathered under a cap. The fair skin had lost its 
beauty and was wrinkled and yellow ; but the eyes were 
still dark and bright, and looked at you sharply enough, 
to show that her mind was very active. Sometimes it 
lived mostly in the past, then flashed out with a sudden 
vigor. She was only a very little deaf. 

Her room opened on the veranda, and was large and 
airy. She never came downstairs now, but often walked 
about leaning on the arm of her faithful attendant. It 
was full of curious relics of bygone times. A great 
canopied bedstead took much of the space at one side. It 
had belonged to one of the old governors, the Marquis 
de Vaudreuil, whose life had been the gayest and most 
extravagant of a corrupt administration — one of the 
many things that had made the earlier French reign a 
success. Curious chests of drawers, with griffins’ heads 
for handles; chairs that had come from France and in- 
dicated various reigns. A veritable museum of curiosities 
it was. A quaintly carved buffet, standing on quite high 
legs and reaching up correspondingly high, was spread 
out with the silver of past generations that was the apple 




of gra’mere’s bright eyes. Every morning Olympie had 
to count the pieces and tell what they were. When 
gra’mere felt in a discursive mood she would recall the 
story of each one and the gay scenes in which they had 
figured. Kerlerec, who had succeeded the Marquis, and 
was recalled in official disgrace and thrown into the 
Bastile ; M. d'Abbadie, with a lower rank, working hard 
at retrenchment, and, in spite of all, crushed at seeing the 
colony handed over to Spain. That old time always 
seemed freshest in her mind. 

This day the fates had conspired to keep her especially 
fresh and bright. Her big chair was like a throne. Her 
great flowered brocade silk, half a century old, flowed 
about her like an iridescent sea. Her fine old lace fichu 
was crossed on her breast; a string of pearls was about 
her throat, her beads and cross were fastened at her 
waist ; and, to-day, she did not look so near the end of the 
century. 

Notable people came and went. M. de Bore con- 
gratulated her on the way she bore her years. Some of 
the Spanish officials dropped in; the Princes — and they 
recalled a reminiscence of the one great King of France 
she had seen. Lesser lights appeared, many simply bow- 
ing and wishing her good-fortune and health. 

In an adjoining room were spread some refreshments, 
and several young ladies, with Claire at their head, pre- 
sided. Young men loitered to breathe a few soft nothings 
or speak of the next ball and the pleasure they hoped to 
have. 

Sylvie always recalled the scene as one of the curiosi- 
ties of her life. She had a feeling at first that gra’mere 
must at some period have been a queen. 

“What golden-haired iille is this?” the old lady ex- 
claimed, rising a little in her chair. “Child, come here, 




and kiss my hand. You are so young and fresh; and, 
one day, you will be old, wrinkled, and your golden hair 
faded.’' 

She held out her hand with its many rings. It was so 
small and pitiful. Sylvie pressed her warm, flushed 
cheek against it. 

“Come and see me again. I like to look at you.’’ 

Sylvie was a little frightened ; and when some one said, 
“What a beautiful child !’’ she shrank behind Barbe. 

“Do you suppose I shall live to be as old as that?’’ 
she asked, as they were going home. “And to be all 
wrinkled and shrunken, and have a queer tremble in your 
voice ” 

“But think of the attention paid her! It is not every 
one who lives to be almost a hundred. Oh, I don’t won- 
der they are proud of her.” 

When Olympie was putting her mistress in the great 
high bed and wrapping her all up in blankets, she said : 
“The prettiest thing that came to give me good wishes 
was that little golden-haired girl. I should like to lay 
my hands on the silken, soft head. And such blue eyes. 
They are like the skies when I was young.” 

The Princes went away. There were strange rumors 
in the air, and several persons were arrested and banished 
to Cuba for too much enthusiasm. General Villaineuve 
was suspected, of sympathizing with some plans for an 
overturn, and even M. de Bore was saved from accusation 
by the devotion of the place to one who had done so much 

for it — as the Governor well understood two such arrests 
as this would be opening a door to enemies on all sides. 

Roger Norton was ready for his journey. Now that 
it had come, they could not bear to part with Gervaise. 

“I feel that it will all be useless,” said Barbe, in a dis- 

couraged tone. “And what will happen to us in the 
meanwhile ” 

“Nothing evil will happen to us, I am quite sure,’’ re- 
turned Angel, with courage. “We shall be lonely, but 
we have some such good friends; and M. Lavalette will 
be like a guardian to us. Only to-day he said we were 
to come to him in any perplexity.’’ 

They had been very happy. Claire was very fond of 
Gervaise, and it would be so easy for him to mistake her 
regard, which had nothing of love in it. The separation 
would be good for him. He was growing too pleasure- 
loving. 

She went out in the garden, for Sylvie’s passionate 
grief quite unsettled her. How strong the child’s feel- 
ings were! Some day the matter must be explained to 
her. 

There was a step, and some one parted the dense 
shrubbery, coming across, instead of by the walk. It 
shook out a cloud of fragrance. She turned and flushed 
deeply. 

“That commonplace adieu was not sufficient,” Roger 
Norton said, hurriedly. “A hundred things may happen, 
and I may never see you again. Still, I am generally 
on the lucky side. But I wanted to say — I ask nothing 
of you either but remembrance — that — I love you ! You 
know nothing about love — I should like to teach you some 
day. Adieu — I shall carry you in my heart.” 

He caught her hand and pressed it to his lips — and was 
gone. Angelique stood in utter amaze. 

“Oh, Mam’selle, come at once,” cried Viny. “The lit- 
tle one has an hysteric, and Mo’sieu Gervaise cannot get 
away. Oh, poor child !” 

Angelique ran. Barbe stood there helpless. The girl 


unclasped the small arms that were like a rope around the 
neck of Gervaise and gathered the slight form to her 
heart. The great sobs shook her, and her eyes were 
transfixed, as if she was half unconscious. 

“Go quick. Oh, Gervaise, heaven be with you and 
bring you back safely ! And if you can find him !” 


CHAPTER XIII. 

ViNY carried the poor little thing upstairs and laid her 
on the bed. She had not fainted, for she breathed at 
intervals, but she was limp and helpless. The smelling 
salts sent little shivers over her, but did not completely 
rouse her. 

“I don’t know what we are to do,” said Barbe, help- 
lessly. “She’s such a child in most things — a baby ! She 
talks to that crane until I do believe he understands 
every word she says. And the cockatoo really cries after 
her, and all those herons — and I feel so afraid, sometimes, 
she’ll begin to charm those horrible snakes and reptiles ! 
I did think she was caring less for Gervaise, but it has 
gone deeper, it seems. And that most unfortunate mar- 
riage !” 

“But if Hugh never should come back! If Gervaise 
should find he had died or been killed ” 

“Then the way is clear for establishing this mar- 
riage.” 

There was a great wrench at Angelique’s heart. 
Perhaps it would be better this way. What brought the 




vision of the enthusiastic young American before her? 
She hated herself that she could think of him. 

“Oh, but you see,” cried Barbe, in anguish, “he does 
not care for her in that way. She is merely a sweet, 
pretty child to him, that he has had to soothe and appease 
and put off until she can understand. It is not real love. 
Now, Philippe adored her.” 

Angelique sighed and went on with her ministrations. 
Between them both they succeeded in restoring her, but 
she looked at them out of woe-begone eyes. 

“Oh,” she cried, at length, “he will never, never come 
back ! I did not think it would be so hard. There are 
all those Indian tribes, with horrid names, who scalp 
every one or burn them at the stake. Oh, poor Ger- 
vaise! And now I wish we had never seen that M’sieu 
Norton. Did he send that beautiful hound? I shall hate 
it, I know.” 

“Zenobie Lavalette goes wild over it. We can let her 
take it.” 

Something like a flash crossed the weary blue eyes. 
“I would rather Hortense should have it,” she made 
answer. 

“He may have taken it with him. It is not here, and 
he said nothing about it when he went away.” 

Angelique colored consciously, with the recollection of 
what he did say. 

“I want Viny to come and hold me,” she insisted, 
rather fretfully. 

Viny came, and took her on her lap in the great reed 
rocking-chair, and crooned out songs in her soft voice, 
that was like a rushy rivulet and had no high notes. 

The next day, and the next day, Sylvie lay on the small 
white cot, or was in Viny’s arms. She wanted nothing to 
eat — she would not even talk. Her eyes seemed to grow 




larger and more wistful, and the color went out of her 
cheeks. 

“What shall we do ?” Barbe kept saying. “Poor petite 
lamb. She looks like her mother.” 

“Is that Telano crying?” she asked of Viny on the 
eve of the second day. 

“Poor Telano. He has done nothing but mourn all 
day little Missy. He will not eat anything.” 

“That is like me.” She smiled faintly. “Do you 
think he would starve?” 

“He looks so sorrowful, and shakes his head.” 

“And he might die. Oh, Viny, I shouldn’t like to die. 
It must be horrid to be shut up in one of those stone 
vaults and never see any one again. All the world is 
so lovely ! The magnolias are coming out — I smell 
them — and the jasmin. Yes, it is pleasanter to live even 
if — the people you love do go away. Viny, carry me 
downstairs, and let me comfort poor Telano.” 

Viny took her down and sat her in the hammock. 
Telano ran awkwardly from the crape-myrtle allee where 
he had been bemoaning his sorrows to the birds of the air. 
The sun was almost down, and the soft red and purplish 
lights were tinted with lavender and green. 

“Poor Telano!” He laid his head in the lap of his 
little mistress and uttered strange, pathetic cries, some of 
them not unlike a turkey’s gobble. When he had gone 
through the whole gamut of sounds, he looked up in 
Sylvie’s face. 

“Yes, Telano, two whole long days! I wasn’t asleep 
nor quite awake, but in some queer sort of atmosphere — 
and I know how it seems.” She patted his head, and 
he arched his neck, then took a few steps away and came 
slowly back. 

“No, I can’t take a run with you. But you shall have 




some bread. All the run has gone out of me, and I just 
want to sit still. I haven’t gone entirely away from you, 
so you can’t understand, though you do know so much. It 
may be a whole long year before Gervaise comes back, 
and a hundred things may happen to him. Nothing 
much happens to little girls, only they grow and grow 
and get to be women ; but it takes a long while,” with a 
sigh. 

Viny returned with some bread. Sylvie crumbed it, 
but Telano did not eat ravenously, as if he had be»rn 
neglected or as if the pond had refused its usual suste- 
nance. Then he came and stood on one foot beside her, 
rubbing her shoulder occasionally, with sympathetic in- 
telligence, while she talked on in a caressing strain. 

Angelique appeared at the edge of the court. 

“Monsieur Norton has sent the dog,” she began stiffly. 
“A slave has him. What shall we do, Sylvie? You do 
not want him.” 

Sylvie was a little offended at the tone. “Send him 
here to me,” she returned. 

“But ” in a hesitating tone. 

“I want to see him,” rather pettishly. 

The slave, a young fellow belonging to the barber, had 
him in charge. He had brought him up the day before, 
but Jaques had dismissed him rather summarily, with the 
tidings that Mam’selle was ill, and could not be bothered 
with the dog. 

He bowed most obsequiously, having met with a 
rather cool reception from Angelique. 

“M’sieu Norton ordered that I should bring him to 
you,” he began in a rather deprecating tone. “He is a 
mos’ beautiful creature. Mademoiselle, and so gentle, so 
loving, so true. If you were to go away at any time, or 
tire of him, I am to keep him until M’sieu comes back.” 




He had the dog in leash — a magnificent, fawn-colored 
hound with a long slender head, fine pink nostrils, and 
most beautiful, entreating eyes. He halted in a question- 
ing attitude. 

“Hylas, come here,” Sylvie said, gently. 

Hylas obeyed, and stood before her a sort of proud 
suppliant. There was a whole story in his glance — the 
story Roger Norton had told more than once. Sylvie 
had made the dog’s acquaintance before, and admired 
him. 

‘T wonder if you would like to live here, Hylas? I 
have Telano, and you would have to be good friends with 
him.” She hugged the crane up closer, who rather glared 
at the new-comer, and the pink rim of his eyes grew 
fiery. 

Hylas gave his tail several emphatic twirls, and his 
eyes said, ‘T have been told to obey. Your will must be 
mine.” 

'‘You are so very handsome and strong, and would take 
care of me, I know.” 

“As for killing snakes, Mam’selle, he’s a master. He 
never lets one get way.” 

Hylas assented to that, emphatically, and came a step 
nearer. 

“Oh, what a pretty collar ! Let me see ” 

He put his nose in her lap. Telano gave a hiss, but 
he looked steadily at the crane. No doubt he would have 
enjoyed twisting his neck with a good strong shake. 

“Hylas! Sylvie Perrier,” she read. “Oh, yes, I must 
keep him, then. Everybody will know he belongs to me.” 
She smiled with delight. “Take off that ugly rope, and 
— I am obliged to you for bringing him. I wonder if he 
will be content? I do not like dogs, generally, but I 

i


like him already. He looks so wise. Hylas, will you 
like to stay here ?” 

Did the dog understand? How much the brute crea- 
tion responds to, as if it surely did. He gave a curious 
sound, not a whine, not a bark, but it appeared to have a 
note of satisfaction in it. He touched the little hand with 
his tongue, caressingly ; his eyes seemed to overflow with 
promise. 

“You may come to-morrow and see if he feels at home 
and would like to stay,” and Sylvie smiled dismissingly. 

The man murmured thanks, and touched his hat, 
braided of the young river reeds — an art learned from the 
Indian squaws. 

Telano did not take very kindly to the head in his 
mistress’s lap. He would have been delighted to make 
an onslaught on the eyes watching him so fearlessly. 

“Now, you must be good friends,” she advised, gravely. 
“Oh, Viny, isn’t it funny? They are like Hortense and 
Zenobie! No, not quite like, for Zenobie doesn’t love 
me at all, but she does not want Hortense to have me to 
herself.” 

“Jealous,” explained Viny, sententiously. 

“And she was so cross that day gra’mere wanted to see 
me ; I was almost afraid, she is so old, and her eyes are so 
sharp. And she made Olympie show me so many queer 
things; and the frock that came from Paris in her little 
trunk, and some splendid rings, and a miniature of old 
gran’pere, set round with diamonds — just like those we 
had to sell when we came here. Hortense loves me ; 
sometimes I wish she did not love me so much and want 
to kiss me all the time. Which will be Hortense, and 
which will be Zenobie?” 

She laughed quite naturally, and glanced from one to 
the other with a sense of amusement. 




'They will both love you, Mam’selle; so, neither can 
be Zenobie. You are so sweet, everything loves you.” 

Sylvie sighed. Did Gervaise love her very much ? He 
was not as vehement as Hortense. 

“Viny, fix the cushions in the hammock. I want to 
lie down. Telano, come around this side, and you can 
stay here, Hylas.” 

Hylas sat down on his haunches and looked kinglike, 
his eyes, so full of wordless knowledge, steadily bent 
upon his new young mistress. 

Was he thinking of the master, so far away? 

Viny swayed the hammock gently, and drove away the 
gnats with a great fan. By and by Telano began to nod 
also, and he presently thrust his bill under his wing. 
But Hylas watched like a sentinel. 

"She has kept the dog,” Angelique announced when 
she saw the slave go out of the gate with a coil of rope 
about his arm. She could not tell why, but it annoyed 
her. It brought Roger too close. She did not want to 
think of him. 

Sylvie was very languid for several days. Hylas came 
up on the balcony, and slept at Sylvie’s door at night. 
When she felt a little stronger, she took Hylas about with 
her, explaining the situation to him. 

"Oh,” with a cry of delight, "how beautiful you have 
made this, Jaques ! And you have cleared up all the wild 
things — they grow so fast. Oh, lovely swans, you have 
a much finer home. Jaques, who told you?” raising her 
glad, eager eyes. 

"No one. I’ve had it in my mind some time. Now one 
can see about a little. It is really a bayou,” and he 
laughed delightedly. 

He had dredged out the pond and enlarged its area, 
making in some places a bed of gravelly stones that shone 

i


in the bottom. A little stream fed it on one side, that was 
lost in the dense woods. The other widened and nar- 
rowed until it spent itself in the river. But instead of 
the river ever draining these small streams and ponds, 
they seemed to grow larger from the overflow of the 
mighty current. The swans’ shelter had been made 
more secure, the herons, were down one end by them- 
selves, and delighted in wading up and down the swampy 
inlet. A small stone wall and platform had been added, 
and the rustic seats renewed. 

“How good you are to me, Jaques !” Her voice was 
full of emotion and she hung on his arm affectionately. 

“Who could help being good to thee ! And, Mam’selle, 
we will take walks about and find many beautiful things. 
I never saw so much grow in any country. It seems as 
if the good God saved his choicest gifts and creations 
for this New World. I hope we shall never need to go 
back to France.” 

“I shall not go if the others do,” she answered, de- 
cisively. “I shall live here always.” 

Jaques laughed softly. She was as much in love with 
the New World as he. 

So by degrees Sylvie woke languidly to her older in- 
terest in daily living, but not quite her olden gayety. 
She was so fond of all the out-of-doors creatures, the 
birds knew her and held their heads on one side in 
listening attitude, looking out of bright eyes as she talked 
to them. The swans came at the sound of her voice, the 
ducks rushed hither and thither when she came. 

“Do you suppose it is just because I bring them some 
choice bits,” she asked of Jaques. “The ducks are greedy, 
I know. But oh, how beautiful they are, in all their 
shining array of gold and green and blue and every 
lovely tint mingled! I suppose it is enough for some 




things just to look beautiful. The flowers cannot under- 
stand affection, yet we give them love for love.’" 

“Thou art a curious little being,” said Jaques. 

“But Telano really does love. How sorry he seemed 
when I was ill! His face was dismal, and his neck so 
long. He missed Gervaise too, I think.” 

“Ah, he did indeed I” 

“And the house seems so strange and still without him. 
He was always whistling to the birds or singing a merry 
carol. Do you think he cared very much for Claire 
Lavalette? She is ten times sweeter than Zenobie, and 
he used to go there so much.” 

“Oh, no,” Jaques tossed his head. 

“Henri de Longpre is very nice, but he talks all the 
time to Angel. And I cannot tell whether he is laughing 
at me or not. I do not like to be laughed at.” 

“Mam’selle, few of us do,” dryly. “We must try and 
laugh back.” 

Sylvie did not understand how any one could, when one 
was a little hurt. 

Angel did not grow especially fond of Hylas, and he 
preserved a cool indifference toward her. Yet sometimes 
when he studied her with those grave, fathomless eyes, 
she felt sure Monsieur Norton had confided his secret 
to him and she shrank at the uncanny consciousness. 

“We must be the better friends, Hylas,” Sylvie would 
sometimes say when they were wandering about the 
thickets. “I can’t tell any one else, but I am sure Ger- 
vaise did not want to go and she sent him, so you have 
lost your friend, and I mine. It is all very mysterious 
and very sad. As for the Marquis de Brienne — oh, I 
think he must be what is called a myth.” 

Hylas nodded sagely. 



It was not Gervaise’s love for Sylvie that Angel had 
been anxious about, but his very great fondness for 
Claire. She gave the same smile and sweetness to 
every one, but it seemed as if that especial one had 
awakened it. How did she manage to be so dainty and 
beguiling and yet keep so innocent at heart? That 
puzzled Angelique. But she could not endure the 
thought that Gervaise should fall so uselessly in love 
and be disappointed. 

Claire came down one morning flushed and smiling, 
with a mysterious sweetness in her eyes and a curious 
sound in her voice. 

“Oh, what has happened ?” cried Angelique. “Nothing 
sad, I know. Gra’mere must be quite as well as usual.” 

“Oh, yes, and very happy. We are all very happy,” 
and her eyes were full of lustrous light. 

“Then your father must have had some great good 
fortune.” 

“Yes, it is good fortune, I suppose, when children 
marry well. Fathers and mothers are both glad. It is 
natural to make new homes.” 

“You do not mean ” 

“I am to be betrothed on Thursday. There will be a 
little feast, and you must all come. It is a saint day, too. 
We are to go to mass in the morning, and though I shall 
be beside maman, I shall have the delight of knowing he 
is there.” 

“He — who?” Angelique was vainly trying to think. 

“Ah, you will hardly guess. It is Eugene Fleurien. 
You met him at the General's birthday, I believe. He is 
very fine and attractive, and rumor gave him to the 
Abeilles, but Marie was betrothed a month ago. Last 
week he went and spoke to papa, and he discussed the 




matter with dear maman, and then Eugene came and, as 
I said, we are to be betrothed and sign the contract.'’ 

“Are you very much in love with him?” For it seemed 
to Angel as if Claire had taken so much general pleasure 
that some deeper feeling was requisite. She had dis- 
covered charms in all young men. 

“Oh, not until afterward,” and she colored deeply. 
“Then we shall love each other sincerely. It will not be 
a long engagement. He has a large plantation at Pointe 
Coupee, and lives there with his father. His two sisters 
are married, his mother is dead. His father has been 
desirous this last year that he should marry and is so 
pleased that I know I shall be admired.” 

It seemed too prosaic, Angel thought, for such a really 
delightful young girl. 

“Oh, I hope you will be very happy,” she cried. 

“I am sure to be. Eugene is so good and merry, and 
is sure to be a rich man. And now that some one has 
invented what is called a cotton-gin, cotton will be profit- 
able. But they are sugar-cane growers mostly. And, 
Angel, you must come and stay days with me ; there are 
fine rides around, and they have horses. When have 
you heard from Gervaise, and where is he? And that 
curious American who was so charming when he had a 
mind?” 

No, she had not cared for Gervaise except in a friendly 
fashion, and Gervaise had sent many messages to her and 
said, “I would write to her if it was proper. Do you 
think it might be ?” 

“Only yesterday a letter came. They were at some 
straits in Michigan that it twists your tongue all up to 
pronounce. I did not even get it spelled out. And 
wonderful lakes, oh, many times larger than Lake Pont- 
chartrain, and such copper mines — enough to make a hun- 





dred people rich. The country is full of Indians, but 
they all seem friendly now.’' 

“And the other cousin ?” 

“Oh, they have heard nothing as yet. The American 
had some interest in the copper-working and in furs. 
They will go down to this place called Detroit, and there 
they may learn what befell him.” 

Angelique choked down a little sigh. 

“And now let us find Madame Champe. Maman 
sends the invitations, and you will not be displeased that 
she does not come herself. There is so much to do. 
Though why, I do not see,” laughing gayly. “There is 
always plenty in the house to eat and drink.”
