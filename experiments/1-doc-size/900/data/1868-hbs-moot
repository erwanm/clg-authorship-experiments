began that bloody and toilsome, but shattering and finally decisive
series of movements which ended with the surrender of the Rebellion,
Sheridan and his horsemen were employed in reconnoitering and guarding
trains. May 9th, he set out on a raid around the rear of Lee's army,
in which he cut up communications, destroyed supplies, and rescued
prisoners; beat the rebel cavalry, killing its leader, J. E. B. Stuart;
penetrated within two miles of Richmond, thoroughly frightening the
rebel capital; extricated his force from a very difficult position on
the Chickahominy, by his peculiar style of swift manoeuvre and furious
fighting; and came safe through at last to Butler's headquarters.

On another similar expedition in June, he severely damaged the rebel
routes of supply to Richmond from the north and west; and for some
time after that, his cavalry were overrunning the country south of
Petersburg and Richmond, while Grant was establishing himself in the
lines before Petersburg.

Sheridan's great historic campaign in the Valley of Virginia was the
crowning glory of his splendid career in the war; a career perhaps more
brilliant with the gleams of battles than that of any other commander.
This fatal valley had from the very beginning of the war been the
opprobrium of the Union armies. From it came General Johnston and
those forces that reinforced Beauregard at Bull Run, and turned that
hap-hazard fight into a victory for the rebels. Through it, alternating
with the ground east of the Blue Ridge, the rebels moved backward and
forward, as they chose, like a checker-player in the "whip-row." In
it, one Union commander after another had been defeated and made to
look ridiculous; and it was the road along which every invasion of the
North, east of the mountains, was laid out, as a matter of course.

Sheridan turned this den of disgraces into a theatre all ablaze with
victories. He was appointed to the command Aug. 7, 1864; for six or
seven weeks simply covered the harvests from the rebel foragers; during
September was at last given leave by Grant to deliver battle; September
19th, defeated Early at Winchester; September 22d, defeated him
again at Fisher's Hill, whither he had retreated; and when the rebel
commander retreated again to the far southern passes of the Blue Ridge,
Sheridan laid the southern part of the valley thoroughly waste, to
prevent the enemy from finding support in it; on the 19th of October,
after his army had been surprised by the persevering Early, defeated,
and driven in disorder five miles, Sheridan faced it about, and turned
the defeat into the most dramatic, brilliant and famous of all his
victories.

In February of the following year, Sheridan took a place in that
vast ring of bayonets and sabres with which Grant sought to envelop
the remaining armies of the rebellion. On the 27th of that month, he
moved rapidly up the valley of his victories, ran over what was left
of Early's force, smashed it and captured two-thirds of it almost
without stopping, then crossed the Ridge, destroyed the James river
canal, and breaking up railroads and bridges as he went, rode across
the country to White House, and thence once more joined Grant below
Petersburg. Last of all, in the final campaign from March 29th to
Lee's surrender on April 9th, Sheridan and his troops were the strong
left hand of Grant in all those operations; thrust furthest out around
Lee, feeling and feeling after him, clutching him whenever there was
a chance, crushing him like a vice at every grasp, and throttling him
with relentless force, until the very power of further resistance was
gone, and that proposed charge of Sheridan's which was stopped by Lee's
flag of truce, would really have been made upon an almost helpless
and disorganized mass of starving, worn-out soldiers and disordered
wagon-trains.

General Sheridan's administration as military governor at New Orleans,
was a surprise to his friends, from its exhibition of broad and high
administrative qualities. Yet there is much that is alike in the
abilities of a good general and a good ruler. Gen. Grant is a very wise
judge of men, and his brief and characteristic record of his estimate
of Sheridan might have justified hopes equal to the actual result. To
any one remembering also his early days of authority over the Yokimas
in Oregon, it would doubtless have done so; for a Yokima community and
the community of an "unreconstructed" southern rebel city are a good
deal alike in many things. What Grant said of Sheridan was as follows,
and was sent to Secretary Stanton just after Cedar Creek, and a little
while before Sheridan's appointment as Major-General in the Regular
Army, in place of McClellan, resigned:

            "CITY POINT, Thursday, Oct. 20, 8 p. m.

  HON. E. M. STANTON, etc.:

  I had a salute of one hundred guns from each of the armies here fired
  in honor of Sheridan's last victory. Turning what bid fair to be a
  disaster into a glorious victory, stamps Sheridan what I always
  thought him, one of the ablest of generals.

        U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General."

The extraordinary series of popular ovations which have attended
Sheridan's recent tour through part of the North, have proved that he
is profoundly admired, honored and loved by all good citizens; and
unless we except Grant, probably Sheridan is the most popular--and
deservedly the most popular--of all the commanders in the war. Such
a popularity, and won not by words but by deeds, is an enviable
possession.

Many men of a very lofty grade of power and excellence have arisen in
our country, among a class who may be described as of Eastern blood
but Western development. They have themselves been born at the East,
or else their parents had either lived there or had been trained in
the ways of the East. Then, growing up in the freer atmosphere, the
more spontaneous life, the larger scale of being, of the West, they
have as it were, themselves enlarged in mind, and have seemingly become
better fitted to cope with vast executive problems. Thus, President
Lincoln was of Eastern Quaker blood; General Grant, of Connecticut
blood; Secretary Chase, of New Hampshire blood; General Sherman, of
Connecticut blood; but they were all either of Western birth or else
trained up in Western habits of thought, sentiment and action. The
West is larger, stronger, freer, than the East, and it affords a better
opportunity for great, spontaneous and powerful men.

Perhaps no family in the whole United States was better adapted
to supply first-class men by this process than the Shermans'. For
generations they have been of strong, practical, thoughtful minds,
employed in the highest occupations, laborious and efficient in action,
pure and lofty in moral tone and character. Roger Minot Sherman, the
Revolutionary statesman, was of this stock, though not in the same
direct line with the General. General Sherman's grandfather, Hon.
Taylor Sherman, was long a judge in Connecticut, and his father, Hon.
Charles R. Sherman, was also a judge, having occupied the bench of
the Superior Court of Ohio during the last six years of his life. He
died in 1829, leaving his widow in narrow circumstances, with eleven
children. Of these, Charles T. Sherman, the eldest, has since been a
successful lawyer at Washington; William Tecumseh, the General, was the
sixth, and John, the energetic, loyal and useful Senator from Ohio,
the seventh. The name of Tecumseh was given in consequence of Judge
Sherman's admiration of the noble qualities of that famous chief.

Thomas Ewing, the eminent Whig politician, speaker and statesman, had
been an intimate personal friend of Judge Sherman, and when the boy,
in those days commonly called by the unlovely nickname of "Cump," from
his Indian name of Tecumseh, was about nine years old, Mr. Ewing kindly
adopted him and assumed the entire charge of his support and education.

Mr. Ewing, in speaking to one of General Sherman's biographers of
his character as a boy, described him as not particularly noticeable
otherwise than as a good scholar and a steady, honest, intelligent
fellow. He said that he "never knew so young a boy who would do an
errand so promptly and correctly as he did. He was transparently
honest, faithful, and reliable. Studious and correct in his habits, his
progress in education was steady and substantial."

In 1836, Mr. Ewing was a member of Congress from Ohio, and having the
right to nominate a cadet at West Point, he offered the appointment to
his adopted son, who gladly accepted it, and went successfully through
the course of study, graduating in 1840. It is a good illustration of
the wholesome stringency of the discipline there, that Sherman's class
was a hundred and forty strong when it entered, but only forty-two were
left to graduate. The rest had fainted by the way for lack of knowledge
or energy, or had been dismissed for some fault. In this "Gideon's
band" of forty-two, Sherman stood sixth. A short extract from one of
his letters while a cadet shows a curious specimen of the same mixture
of peremptory sternness in exacting duties and substantial kindness to
those who deserved it but no others, which have so often been noted
in him since. He writes about the freshman who was according to custom
under his particular charge, by the local appellation of a "pleb," as
follows:

"As to lording it over the plebs, * * * I had only one, whom I made,
of course, tend to a pleb's duty, such as bringing water, policing the
tent, cleaning my gun and accoutrements and the like, and repaid in
the usual and cheap coin--advice; and since we have commenced studying,
I make him bone (i. e. study,) and explain to him the difficult
parts of algebra and the French grammar, since he is a good one and a
fine fellow; but should he not carry himself straight I should have
him found (i. e., rejected at examination) in January and sent off,
that being the usual way in such cases, and then take his bed, table
and chair, to pay for the Christmas spree." It is evident that while he
was well enough satisfied to help his "fine fellow," he would not have
cried much while he saw him turned away if for sufficient cause, or
when he proceeded to confiscate his scanty furniture.

Sherman was commissioned at graduating, Second Lieutenant in the third
U. S. Artillery; in November 1841 joined his company at Fort Pierce,
in East Florida; in January 1842 became First Lieutenant, and served
successfully at different points in Florida, at Fort Morgan on Mobile
Point, Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, and other posts in the
South, for some years. During this time the natural elevation of his
character saved him from the frivolous or shameful indulgences too
often fallen into by officers on garrison duty; he read and studied
works on his profession, acquainted himself with the common law, and
amused himself with petting birds and beasts, fishing, hunting and
occasionally with visiting.

When the Mexican War broke out he was at first sent on recruiting duty,
but he quickly set to work to beg for active service, and on June 29,
1846, he at last received an order to join his company at New York, on
the way to California, to meet Kearny's expedition across the plains.
He set out the very next day, without waiting to visit even Miss Ewing,
his guardian's daughter, to whom he was engaged, and sailed with
his company in the storeship Lexington, under the command of Lieut.
Theodorus Bailey, now Rear-Admiral. General Ord and General Halleck
were fellow lieutenants with Sherman, and sailed with him. An account
written by a shipmate during this voyage, thus describes Sherman:

"The first lieutenant was a tall, spare man, apparently about thirty
years of age, with sandy hair and whiskers, and a reddish complexion.
Grave in his demeanor, erect and soldierly in his bearing, he was
especially noticeable for the faded and threadbare appearance of his
uniform. * * * He was characterized at this time by entire devotion to
his profession in all its details. His care for both the comfort and
discipline of his men was constant and unwearied."

His California campaigns were not very adventurous, but he became
reputed an excellent business officer in his staff appointment as
assistant adjutant-general. Returning in 1850, he married Miss Ewing,
May 1st, of that year. In September he was made a commissary of
subsistence with the rank of Captain; in March 1851, was commissioned
brevet Captain, "for meritorious services in California," and in
September 1853, seeing no prospects in the army that satisfied him,
he resigned, and became manager of Lucas, Miner & Co's branch banking
house at San Francisco.

It is probable that the superintendency of the Louisiana State
Military Academy, which with a salary of $5,000 was offered to him
and accepted in 1860, was intended to secure his own co-operation
in case of secession, or at least his services in training southern
officers. But his term of office was not long; although as has been
sarcastically observed, "since then, he has had the opportunity to
still further educate his former pupils." He had not been in his new
post a half year, when, foreseeing the necessary result of the counsels
of the South, and not waiting for the overt act which almost all other
good citizens needed to open their eyes, he decided upon his course,
and wrote to Governor Moore a letter which has been often printed,
but which cannot be too often printed; a noble and simple avowal of
patriotic principle and duty. It was as follows:

            January 8, 1861.

  "Governor THOMAS O. MOORE, Baton Rouge, Louisiana:

  "SIR:--As I occupy a quasi-military position under this State,
  I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted such position
  when Louisiana was a State in the Union, and when the motto of
  the seminary was inserted in marble over the main door, 'By the
  liberality of the General Government of the United States. The Union:
  Esto Perpetua.'

  "Recent events foreshadow a great change, and it becomes all men to
  choose. If Louisiana withdraws from the Federal Union, I prefer to
  maintain my allegiance to the old Constitution as long as a fragment
  of it survives, and my longer stay here would be wrong in every sense
  of the word. In that event, I beg you will send or appoint some
  authorized agent to take charge of the arms and munitions of war here
  belonging to the State, or direct me what disposition should be made
  of them.

  "And furthermore, as President of the Board of Supervisors, I beg you
  to take immediate steps to relieve me as superintendent the moment
  the State determines to secede; for on no earthly account will I do
  any act, or think any thought, hostile to or in defiance of the old
  Government of the United States.

      With great respect, &c.,
    (Signed,)     W. T. SHERMAN."

The rebels had lost their general. His resignation was at once
accepted, and Sherman went to St. Louis, where he had left his family,
and impatient of idleness, became superintendent of a street railroad
company, and so remained until after the surrender of Sumter.

He now went to Washington and offered his services to Government.
Secretary Cameron replied, "The ebullition of feeling will soon
subside; we shall not need many troops." Mr. Lincoln replied, "We shall
not need many men like you; the storm will soon blow over." In short,
Sherman could not make anybody believe him, and he experienced a good
deal of the disagreeable fate of prophets of evil; and not for the last
time either. But he was totally unmoved in his conviction; he refused
to have any thing to do with raising three-months' men, saying, "You
might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with
a squirt-gun;" and he still vainly urged the government with all his
might to fling the whole military power of the country at once upon the
rebellion and crush the beginning of it. When, however, the regular
army was enlarged, Sherman applied for a command in the new force, and
Gen. McDowell readily procured him a commission as Colonel of the 13th
Regular Infantry, and in the meanwhile, the regiment not being yet
raised, he served as brigadier in the battle of Bull Run, under Gen.
Tyler, commanding a division.

In this defeat, Sherman and his brigade did very creditably. His
promptitude in going into action, and his good fighting, were of great
use in gaining the advantages of the beginning of the battle; he did
not retreat until ordered to do so, and retired in comparatively good
order. He used his natural freedom and plainness of speech in observing
upon the conduct of his own officers and men during the battle, and
made enemies thereby; but he had so clearly shown himself a good
and ready soldier, that when his brother the Senator and the Ohio
delegation urged his appointment as brigadier-general of volunteers
it was soon given him, and after remaining in the Army of the Potomac
until September, 1861, he was sent to Kentucky, as second in command
under Gen. Anderson, commanding the department. A month afterwards,
Anderson's health having broken down, Sherman succeeded him.

In a few days, Mr. Secretary Cameron, and Adjutant-General Lorenzo
Thomas, came to Louisville, in a hurry to have the new department
commander beat the rebels and secure Kentucky to the Union. Sherman
knew war, almost intuitively; he knew the resources and the spirit
of the rebels, and the military characteristics of Kentucky, and
of Tennessee behind it. "How many troops," asked the Secretary of
War, "do you require in your department?" "Sixty thousand," answered
Sherman, "to drive the enemy out of Kentucky; two hundred thousand to
finish the war in this section." This seems to have struck the two
inquirers as sheer nonsense; and in the adjutant-general's report,
which--as if to help the rebels to as full information as possible--was
at once printed in all the newspapers, with full particulars of
the state of the armies at the west, Sherman's estimate was barely
announced, without explanation or comment. All those persons who
understood less of war than Sherman, now at once set him down for a
man of no sense or judgment. A disreputable newspaper correspondent,
enraged at Sherman for some reason, seized the opportunity to set
afloat a story that Sherman was actually crazy, and the lie was really
believed by multitudes all over the United States. The war-prophet was
misunderstood and despised again, even more remarkably than when he
foretold a long war, before Bull Run. Sherman's official superiors so
far sympathised with this clamor as to supersede him by Gen. Buell,
and to send him to Gen. Halleck, who had faith enough left in him to
put him in charge of the recruiting rendezvous at Benton Barracks, St.
Louis.

Here he remained, hard at work on mere details, all winter. When
Grant, having taken Fort Henry, came down the Tennessee, and turning
about, ascended the Cumberland, to attack Donelson, Gen. Sherman was
ordered to Paducah, to superintend the sending forward of supplies
and reinforcements, a duty which he performed with so much speed and
efficiency, that Gen. Grant reported himself "greatly indebted for his
promptness."

After Donelson, Sherman was appointed to the fifth of the six divisions
in which Grant organized the army with which he advanced by Nashville
to Shiloh; the greenest of all the divisions, no part of it having
been under fire, or even under military discipline. At the battle of
Shiloh, Sherman's troops, with the magnificent inborn courage of the
western men, green as they were, fought like veterans; and his and
McClernand's divisions were the only part of Grant's army that at all
held their ground, and even this was only done after twice falling
back to new positions, in consequence of the giving way of troops on
either hand. It was with Sherman that Grant agreed, before he knew
of the close approach of reinforcements, to attack in the morning;
and after the disappointed Beauregard had retreated next day, it was
Sherman who moved his division in pursuit; although the exhausted and
disorganized condition of the troops prevented continuing the pursuit.
He was severely wounded by a bullet through the left hand on the first
day of the fight; bandaged the wound and kept on fighting; was wounded
again the next day, and had three horses shot under him, but rode out
the battle on the fourth. Though the very first battle in which he had
held an independent command--for it was to a great degree such--so
thoroughly was he master of the "profession in all its details," to
which he had seemed so devoted when a lieutenant on shipboard, that
he seems to have found no embarrassment in using all the resources
which any commander could have employed in his place. Halleck, a
man sparing of compliments, in asking that Sherman should be made
major-general of volunteers, said: "It is the unanimous opinion here
that Brigadier-General W. T. Sherman saved the fortunes of the day on
the 6th, and contributed largely to the glorious victory of the 7th."

And General Grant, whose noble friendship with Sherman, beginning
about this time, has continued unbroken ever since, spoke subsequently
in still more decided and generous terms, when asking for Sherman a
commission as brigadier in the regular service. He wrote to the War
Department:

"At the battle of Shiloh, on the first day, he held, with raw troops,
the key point of the landing. It is no disparagement to any other
officer to say, that I do not believe there was another division
commander on the field who had the skill and experience to have done
it. To his individual efforts I am indebted for the success of that
battle."

During the following operations against and around Corinth, Sherman
and his division did most excellent service. He had now received
his commission as a major-general of volunteers. When Grant became
commander of the Department of the Tennessee, in July, 1862, at the
time of Halleck's appointment as general-in-chief, he placed Sherman in
command of the bitterly and perseveringly rebel city of Memphis, which
Sherman governed sternly, shrewdly, thoroughly and well, under the laws
of war, until autumn.

In Grant's first attempt against Vicksburg, Sherman's attack by
Chickasaw Bluffs, was an important part of the plan. It failed,
because the other parts--Grant's march in consequence of the surrender
of Holly Springs, and Banks' movement from New Orleans for other
reasons--did not succeed; but Grant, in afterwards examining the
ground, said that Sherman's arrangement was "admirable."

The capture of the strong rebel fort at Arkansas Post, January 11,
1863, was a suggestion of General Sherman's, who commanded the land
force which carried the fort, after one day's fire, with the hearty
help of Admiral Porter's fleet.

In Grant's successive attempts against Vicksburg, Sherman was an
indefatigable and most efficient helper. In the final move across the
river south of the place, Sherman co-operated by amusing the enemy
with a false attack at Haines' Bluff, which was kept up with great
ostentation during two days, a large rebel force being thus detained
from going down the river to oppose Grant's crossing there. In the
series of marches and battles that cut off Johnston from Pemberton,
destroyed the military importance for the time being of the city
of Jackson, and drove Pemberton into the lines of Vicksburg; and
during the siege, in effectually preventing any chance of relief from
Johnston, Sherman's services were constant and valuable. Instantly upon
the surrender, he moved his army corps against Jackson, where Johnston
had halted, and by way of finish to the campaign, drove him out, and
thoroughly broke up the railroad lines meeting there. We quote again
Grant's frank acknowledgment of the services of his great lieutenant:

"The siege of Vicksburg and last capture of Jackson and dispersion of
Johnston's army entitle Gen. Sherman to more credit than generally
falls to the lot of one man to earn. His demonstration at Haines'
Bluff, * * * his rapid marches to join the army afterwards; his
management at Jackson, Mississippi, in the first attack; his almost
unequaled march from Jackson to Bridgeport, and passage of Black River;
his securing Walnut Hills on the 18th of May, attest his great merit as
a soldier."

General Sherman's commission as brigadier in the regular army, dated
July 4, 1863, the day of the fall of Vicksburg, reached him August
14th, following; and we quote a passage of his letter to General Grant
on the occasion, for the pleasant purpose of recording it near Grant's
expressions of obligation to Sherman:

"I had the satisfaction to receive last night the appointment as
brigadier-general in the regular army, with a letter from General
Halleck, very friendly and complimentary in its terms. I know that I
owe this to your favor, and beg to acknowledge it and add, that I value
the commission far less than the fact that this will associate my name
with yours and McPherson's in opening the Mississippi, an achievement
the importance of which cannot be over-estimated.

"I beg to assure you of my deep personal attachment, and to express the
hope that the chances of war will leave me to serve near and under you
till the dawn of that peace for which we are contending, with the only
purpose that it shall be honorable and lasting."

Rosecrans was defeated at Chickamauga by Bragg, Sept. 19th and 20th,
1863. On this, Grant was placed in command of the whole Military
Division of the Mississippi, and Sherman under him over the Department
of the Tennessee. He was at once set to march his troops four hundred
miles across to Grant at Chattanooga; accomplished it with wonderful
energy, skill and speed; commanded Grant's left at the battle of
Chattanooga, beginning the fight, and sustaining and drawing the rebel
attacks until their center was weakened enough to enable the Union
center under Thomas to storm Missionary Ridge, and win the battle.
After the victory and the enemy's pursuit, Sherman's force was sent
straightway northward a further hundred miles, to relieve Burnside, now
perilously beset in Knoxville. Colonel Bowman thus powerfully states
the task which this energetic and enduring commander and army performed:

"A large part of Sherman's command had marched from Memphis, had gone
into battle immediately on arriving at Chattanooga, and had had no rest
since. In the late campaign officers and men had carried no luggage and
provisions. The week before, they had left their camps, on the right
bank of the Tennessee, with only two days' rations, without a change
of clothing, stripped for the fight, each officer and man, from the
commanding general down, having but a single blanket or overcoat. They
had now no provisions save what had been gathered by the road, and were
ill supplied for such a march. Moreover, the weather was intensely
cold. But twelve thousand of their fellow-soldiers were beleaguered in
a mountain town eighty-four miles distant; they needed relief, and
must have it in three days. This was enough. Without a murmur, without
waiting for anything, the Army of the Tennessee directed its course
upon Knoxville."

This vigorous forced march was entirely successful; Longstreet, after
one violent and vain assault against Burnside's works, fled eastward
into Virginia, and Sherman, returning and placing his troops in camp
to rest and refresh, returned to Memphis. While there, March 10, 1864,
he received that simple and noble letter from Grant, acknowledging the
latter's obligations to Sherman and McPherson, which we have copied in
our chapter on General Grant. We quote Sherman's reply, which is indeed
not less interesting than the letter as a display of frank and manly
friendship, and which moreover contains one of Sherman's characteristic
prophecies, viz., the final allusion to the winding up of the war by
the "Great March," and the siege of Richmond, when the West should once
more have been made sure:

"DEAR GENERAL:--I have your more than kind and characteristic letter of
the 4th inst. I will send a copy to General McPherson at once.

"You do yourself injustice and us too much honor in assigning to us too
large a share of the merits which have led to your high advancement.
I know you approve the friendship I have ever professed to you, and
will permit me to continue, as heretofore, to manifest it on all proper
occasions.

"You are now Washington's legitimate successor, and occupy a position
of almost dangerous elevation; but if you can continue, as heretofore,
to be yourself, simple, honest and unpretending, you will enjoy through
life the respect and love of friends, and the homage of millions of
human beings, that will award you a large share in securing to them and
their descendants a government of law and stability.

"I repeat, you do General McPherson and myself too much honor. At
Belmont you manifested your traits--neither of us being near. At
Donelson, also, you illustrated your whole character. I was not near,
and General McPherson in too subordinate a capacity to influence you.

"Until you had won Donelson, I confess I was almost cowed by the
terrible array of anarchical elements that presented themselves at
every point; but that admitted a ray of light I have followed since.

"I believe you are as brave, patriotic, and just as the great
prototype, Washington--as unselfish, kind-hearted, and honest as a man
should be--but the chief characteristic is the simple faith in success
you have always manifested, which I can liken to nothing else than the
faith a Christian has in the Saviour.

"This faith gave you victory at Shiloh and Vicksburg. Also, when
you have completed your preparations, you go into battle without
hesitation, as at Chattanooga--no doubts--no reverses; and I tell you
it was this that made us act with confidence. I knew, wherever I was,
that you thought of me, and if I got in a tight place you would help me
out, if alive.

"My only point of doubts was in your knowledge of grand strategy, and
of books of science and history; but I confess, your common sense
seems to have supplied all these.

"Now, as to the future. Don't stay in Washington. Come West; take to
yourself the whole Mississippi Valley. Let us make it dead sure--and
I tell you, the Atlantic slopes and Pacific shores will follow its
destiny, as sure as the limbs of a tree live or die with the main
trunk. We have done much, but still much remains. Time and time's
influences are with us. We could almost afford to sit still, and let
these influences work.

"Here lies the seat of the coming empire, and from the West, when our
task is done, we will make short work of Charleston and Richmond, and
the impoverished coast of the Atlantic.

      Your sincere friend,
        W. T. SHERMAN."

When Grant was appointed Lieutenant-General, Sherman succeeded him
in the great command of the Department of the Mississippi; and
accompanying Grant from Nashville to Cincinnati on the road of the
former to Washington, the two great commanders on the way and at
the Burnet House in Cincinnati, agreed together upon the whole main
structure of that colossal campaign which during the following thirteen
months smote into annihilation all that remained of the military power
of the rebellion.

Sherman at once set to work to accumulate stores sufficient for a
campaign, and his own statements of his motives and views in so doing,
are so comically like his doctrines about his "pleb" when a cadet at
West Point, that we quote a couple of passages. Having put a stop to
the government issues of rations to the poor of East Tennessee, he says:

"At first my orders operated very hardly, but * * * no actual
suffering resulted, and I trust that those who clamored at the cruelty
and hardships of the day have already seen in the result a perfect
justification of my course."

Seeing it himself, it is moreover clear that if they did not, it would
not particularly distress him. In stating how he proposed to live if he
marched into Georgia, he is as independently and rigidly just:

"Georgia has a million of inhabitants. If they can live, we should not
starve. If the enemy interrupt my communications, I will be absolved
from all obligations to subsist on my own resources, but feel perfectly
justified in taking whatever and wherever I can find. I will inspire my
command, if successful, with my feelings, and that beef and salt are
all that are absolutely necessary to life, and parched corn fed General
Jackson's army once, on that very ground."

All things being ready, Sherman moved from Chattanooga on May 6th,
1864, and by a series of laborious marches, skillful manoeuvres and
well fought battles, flanked or drove Johnston backwards from one
strong post to another, until on the 17th of July, Jefferson Davis
greatly simplified and shortened Sherman's problem by putting the rash
and incompetent Hood in the place of the skillful and persevering
soldier who had with less than half Sherman's force, by using the
natural advantages of the country, made him take seventy-two days to
advance a hundred miles, and at the end of that time actually had more
troops than at first, while Sherman had many less. In fact, Johnston
was on the very point of making a dangerous attack on Sherman at the
right point, when Hood took command, at once attacked on the wrong
one, and was defeated. Still advancing, Sherman manoeuvred Hood out
of Atlanta; saw that mad bull of a general set off some months later,
head down and eyes shut, on his way to dash himself against the steady
strength of Thomas at Nashville; and turning back to Atlanta, he
prepared for his Great March to the Sea.

He had already cleaned Atlanta clean of rebels; exporting all of them
within their own military lines, and meeting their own and also Hood's
appeals, respectively piteous and enraged, with sarcastic answers in
his own inimitable style of cold sharp just reasoning. He made the city
nothing but a place of arms; and having almost exactly the force of
all arms that he had required for his purpose--for his Cassandra days
were over, and his country was by this time glad and prompt to believe
him and give him the tools he needed to do its work with--he issued
his orders of march on November 9th; sent his last dispatch from the
interior to Washington, on the 11th; his army was cut free from its
former communications next day; on the 14th it was concentrated at
Atlanta; next day two hundred acres of buildings, including all but the
private dwellings of the city were burned or blown up; a Massachusetts
brigade, its band playing the wonderful "John Brown" folk-song, was the
last to leave the city; and with all the railroads effectually ruined
behind it, and a parting message to General Thomas that "All is well,"
all organized, provisioned, and stripped down to the very last limit
of impediments, "the Lost Army" and its great leader set their faces
southward and disappeared from the sight of their loyal countrymen for
four weeks.

We cannot here repeat the well known and romantic story of that Great
March. With scarcely any serious opposition, Sherman, an unsurpassed
master in the art of moving great armies, deluded what few opponents
there were, with feints and marches on this side and on that, or
brushed them away if they stood, and pierced straight through the
very heart of the rebellion to Savannah; stormed Fort McAllister,
opened communication with the fleet, drove Hardee out of Savannah, and
presented the city and 25,000 bales of cotton, a "Christmas present"
to President Lincoln; then turning northward, resumed his deadly way
along the vitals of the confederacy, doing exactly what he had foretold
in his letter to Grant; and sure enough, they did between them, "make
short work of Charleston and Richmond and the impoverished coast of
the Atlantic." The surrender of Lee was quickly followed by that
of Johnston, and except for the small force which for a short time
remained in arms beyond the Mississippi, the rebellion was ended.

We cannot even give specimen extracts of the many strongly and clearly
worded papers written by General Sherman during his military career,
as general orders, directions for the government of captured places
or property, or discussions of points of military or civil law. But
we must transcribe the noblest compliment which the great soldier
ever received; the testimony of the colored clergyman, Rev. Garrison
Frazier, at Savannah, during the conferences there for organizing
the freedmen, to the merits of General Sherman towards the race. Mr.
Frazier said:

"We looked upon General Sherman prior to his arrival as a man in the
providence of God specially set apart to accomplish this work, and
we unanimously feel inexpressible gratitude to him, looking upon him
as a man that should be honored for the faithful performance of his
duty. Some of us called on him immediately upon his arrival, and it is
probable he would not meet the Secretary with more courtesy than he
met us. His conduct and deportment towards us characterized him as
a friend and a gentleman. We have confidence in General Sherman, and
think whatever concerns us could not be under better management."

Of Sherman's characteristics as a general, we shall also give one
single trait illustrating the most wonderful of them all--his almost
divining foresight. We have more than once showed how he foresaw
only too much for his own comfort; but in the present instance he
kept the matter to himself. It was, a preparation when the war broke
out for that very march which he foretold in his letter to Grant and
afterwards made. This preparation consisted in his obtaining from
the Census Bureau at Washington a map of the "Cotton States," with
a table giving the latest census returns of the cattle, horses and
other products of each county in them. On the basis of this he studied
the South for three years; and when the time for the march came, he
knew substantially the whole resources of the country he was to pass
through.

General Sherman's negotiations with Johnston, their disapproval by
Government, and his quarrel in consequence with General Halleck and
Secretary Stanton were unfortunate; but it would be utterly absurd to
admit for a moment that his motives in what he did were other than
the very best; and his own explanation of the affair shows that he
was following out a policy which would have been in full harmony with
President Lincoln's own feelings, as communicated to Sherman on the
subject.

Perhaps General Sherman may some day be selected for some high
civil office. He is a man perhaps only of too lofty character and
too brilliant genius to be harnessed into political traces. He was
once nominated for something or other at San Francisco, but when the
"committee" came to tell him, he answered sarcastically, "Gentlemen,
I am not eligible; I am not properly educated to hold office!" Col.
Bowman observes, "This nomination was the commencement of his political
career, and his reply was the end of it." It is true in too many cases
that a true soldier, like a good citizen, will find his very virtues
the insurmountable obstacles to political success. This is perhaps
likely to remain the case unless the rule shall come into vogue that
nobody shall have an office who lets it be known that he wants it.

The spirit of Christ is all love; it seeks only to enhance the highest
good of existence, and to give to every being its utmost of happiness.
The spirit of war is all wrath. It seeks to destroy by violence, and
as fast as possible, whatever and whoever may oppose it. These two
principles would seem so diametrically opposed to each other, that no
man could be at once a Christian and a soldier, any more than he could
ride at once on two horses going in opposite directions, or turn his
back on himself, and at once go forward and backward. Indeed, the cases
where the two professions have been united are rare, and may probably
depend upon some uncommon conjunction of gifts. But there certainly
have been such. Colonel Gardiner was one. General Havelock was another;
and General Howard, who has been surnamed the Havelock of America, is
another.

Oliver Otis Howard was born in Leeds, Maine, Nov. 8th, 1830. His father
was a thrifty and independent farmer. The boy lived at home until he
was ten, when his father dying, an uncle, Hon. John Otis, of Hallowell,
took charge of him. He now attended school, went through Bowdoin
College, and then entered the West Point Academy, graduating there in
1854, fourth in general standing of his class. Beginning, as usual, as
brevet second lieutenant, he was assigned to the ordnance department;
and in 1856 was chief ordnance officer in Florida, during a campaign
against the Indians there. He worked steadily on in his profession,
and at the beginning of the war was assistant professor of mathematics
at West Point, and being desirous to accept the command of a volunteer
regiment from his own State, asked leave from the War Department to
do so, and was refused. On this he resigned his commission, and the
Governor of Maine, in the end of May, 1861, appointed him colonel of
the Third Maine Volunteers, which was the first three years' regiment
from that State.

At Bull Run, he commanded a brigade, being senior colonel on the field,
and for good conduct there, was in the following September commissioned
brigadier-general of volunteers. In December he was placed in General
Sumner's command; and he remained in the Army of the Potomac until the
latter part of September, 1863, when, having risen to the command of
the Eleventh Army Corps, that and Slocum's corps, both under Hooker,
were sent to reinforce the army at Chattanooga.

During this time General Howard was present in all the chief battles of
the Army of the Potomac. At Fair Oaks, on the Peninsula, he was twice
wounded in the right arm, and had to have his arm amputated; but he got
back in season for the next battle--that of the second Bull Run. At
Antietam, at Fredericksburg, at Chancellorsville, he was present and
fought his command to the uttermost. At Gettysburg, Howard's troops
held the key of the position, the cemetery; and a soldier who was in
the field with him in that tremendous fight, in speaking of his extreme
calmness and coolness under fire, said, "General Howard stood there as
if nothing at all was the matter. He never takes stimulants, either.
Most of the officers do, but he never does. He was so calm because
he was a Christian." Colonel Bowman, in speaking of this same trait
in General Howard, testifies to the same point; observing that he is
"careless of exposing his person in battle, to an extent that would be
attributable to rashness or fatalism if it were not known to spring
from religion."

During his campaigns with Sherman he was a most trustworthy and
serviceable commander; singularly cool and fearless in battle, and most
prompt and thorough in the performance of whatever duty was imposed
upon him. After accompanying Sherman in his march for the relief of
Burnside, General Howard served in the Atlanta campaign in command
of the Fourth Army Corps; after the death of General McPherson, he
succeeded him in the important command of the Army of the Tennessee;
and in Sherman's Great March, he was placed in command of the right
wing, one of the two into which Sherman's force was divided, and in
this position served until the end of the war.

General Sherman quickly liked his trusty and helpful subordinate,
and has repeatedly paid high compliments to his soldierly and moral
excellence. At the end of the Chattanooga campaign, for instance, in
reporting to Gen. Grant, he said, "In General Howard throughout I found
a polished and Christian gentleman, exhibiting the highest and most
chivalrous traits of the soldier." Colonel Bowman speaks of General
Howard's practice of Christian observances in the army with a curious
sort of admiration which sufficiently shows how uncommon it was, at
least among officers of high grade. He says:

"General Howard, it is well known, has been pious and exemplary from
his boyhood, was ever faithful and devoted in the discharge of his
religious duties, and this even while a student at West Point. He
carried his religious principles with him into the army, and was guided
and governed by them in all his relations with his officers and men. No
matter who was permitted to share his mess or partake of his repast,
whether the lowest subaltern of his command or General Sherman himself,
no one thought to partake, if General Howard were present, without
first the invocation of the Divine blessing, himself usually leading,
like the father of a family. General Sherman seems greatly to have
admired the Christian character of General Howard, * * * and not only
as a Christian but as a soldier, preferring him and promoting him to
the command of one of his armies." President Lincoln also valued him
very highly, and was his immovable friend.

General Howard's unconditional devotion to duty was very strongly shown
in the use he made of his time while disabled from military duty just
after the loss of his arm. One of his companions in the service has
described how--

"Weak and fainting from hemorrhage and the severe shock his system
had sustained, the next day he started for his home in Maine. He
remained there only two months, during which time he was not idle.
Visiting various localities in his native State, he made patriotic
appeals to the people to come forward and sustain the government. Pale,
emaciated, and with one sleeve tenantless, he stood up before them,
the embodiment of all that is good and true and noble in manhood. He
talked to them as only one truly loyal can talk--as one largely endowed
with that patriotism which is a heritage of New England blood. Modesty,
sincerity, and earnestness characterized his addresses, and his fervent
appeals drew hundreds of recruits around the national standard."

Howard's reply to the swearing teamster was a good instance of kind but
decided reproof, of just the sort that will do good if any will. The
story is this:

"On one occasion, a wagon-master, whose teams were floundering through
the bottomless mud of a Georgia swamp, became exasperated at the
unavoidable delay, and indulged in such a torrent of profanity as can
only be heard in the army or men of his class. General Howard quietly
approached, unperceived by the offender, and was an unwilling listener
to the blasphemous words. The wagon-master, on turning around, saw his
general in close proximity, and made haste to apologize for his profane
outburst, by saying, 'Excuse me, General, I did not know you were
here.' The General, looking a reprimand, replied, 'I would prefer that
you abstain from swearing from a higher and better motive than because
of my presence.'"

In May, 1865, General Howard was placed at the head of the Freedmen's
Bureau; a position for which he was probably the very best man in the
United States, one whose extremely noble and benevolent purpose was
wholly in harmony with the loftiest traits of his own character, and
whose peculiar difficulties were such as he was exactly the man to
encounter, by nature, education and official position.

By imagining one's self to have passed forward in history for a century
or two centuries, and to be taking such a backward perspective view
of the southern rebellion as such an advance would give, any mind of
historic qualities will perceive more clearly than in any other way the
falling off and disappearance of the minor circumstances of the great
struggle, and the few great features that remain--the central facts,
the real meanings of the war. Of all these, that which will remain
most important is, the escape from their modern Egypt of the nation
of the slaves. Lives and deeds of individual men will grow obscure.
The gigantic battles, the terrific novelties, the vast campaigning
combinations of the successive chapters of the war will lose their
present strong colors. Even the fact that part of the white population
of the United States sought in vain to sever their political union
with the rest, will lose its present foremost place in the story;
for it will have assumed the character of an abortive delusion; a
temporary struggle, whose pretended reasons were sophistical and false,
whose real ones were kept out of sight as much as possible, and which
ended in the speedy re-establishment of the power attacked. But the
emancipation of the slaves is an eternal epoch; it marks the point
where the race of one vast continent, after centuries of exile into
another continent and of the most degrading subjection to another race,
is all at once let out into civilization; brought forth from the pens
of beasts, to take a place among the sons of men. Yet more; they are
admitted to take a place among the sons of God; for American slavery,
as if with the devil's own cunning and cruel power, did really not only
exclude the slave from becoming a citizen, but it actually excluded him
from the power of becoming a Christian. The emancipation of the slaves
was even more than the organization of a new nation; for it was the
birth into humanity of a new race.

This view of the case is naturally even now not accepted by large
numbers of persons. It was a matter of course that still larger
numbers should fail to understand it in the day of it. President
Lincoln himself apparently felt more hope than expectation upon the
subject; and all know how long he delayed, how unendurably slow he
seemed to far-sighted lovers of humanity, before he issued his great
proclamation. But there are a few men, who possess at once a powerful
