A number of cattle had been trampled 
to death in the stampede, and the bodies 
lay within a few miles of the mountains. 
It was inevitable that bears would come out 
to eat the carcasses. On the night of the 
day of terrifying memory no one felt equal 
to the exertion of another ten mile ride 
and the subsequent battle with a possible 
herd of bears. But at eight o'clock orb 
the following night Don Tiburcio, Padre 
Osuna, the boys, some ten of the caba- 
lleros, and as many vaqueros mounted 
and rode forth for a good night's sport. 
The moon was thin and low. As they 
approached the spot where the first of the 
wild band had succumbed to fatigue they 





saw a dark object moving beside the carcass. The approach was stealthy, but the 
bear suddenly raised his head. In a second five or six lassos had sprung through 
the air. One caught the bear a brown 
bear of moderate size about the neck, 
another about a hind leg. The brute 
drew his legs together like a bucking 
horse and leaped into the air, then plunged 
toward his tormentors ; but those that had 
him in lasso galloped in different directions, and poor bruin was quickly strained 
and strangled to death. Two vaqueros 
were left to skin him, and the party rode 
on. In a very few moments they saw a 
moving group some distance ahead. Spur 
ring their mustangs they dashed forward, 
letting the lassos fly. Now the sport be 
came truly exciting and dangerous. Some 
six or eight brown bears, of varying sizes, 
growled furiously and bounded toward 
the intruders. Three were caught in the 
meshes of the rope, the others were making straight for the horses. There was only 
one thing to do. The men put spurs and 
galloped rapidly away, the bears plunging 



 

heavily in pursuit. When the men had 
outdistanced the bears by a hundred yards 
or more, they wheeled suddenly and trotted 
back, once more letting fly the lasso. 
This time all but one were roped; as they 
kicked in fury, their hind legs were caught 
by the lariats held in reserve ; and there 
followed a scene of plunging and springing, galloping, shouting, growling ; and 
neighing, for the mustangs were fully 
alive to their part. 

The one bear at liberty rode straight for 
Roldan. 

He had hurled his lasso with the rest, 
and it was trailing. He jerked about and 
fled for a mile or more, holding on with 
his legs while both hands were occupied 
gathering in the rope and coiling it 
about the high pommel of his saddle. 
Then he turned and charged full at the 
bear, who was hot in pursuit and no mean 
runner. He hurled the lariat. It fell 
short, and lay quivering on the ground 
like a huge wounded snake. Roldan gave 
an exclamation, of surprise as much as of 
dismay: he was an expert with the rope. 

He turned, however, dragging it in. It 
caught about the mustang's hind legs. 
The beast went down, neighing with 
horror. Roldan tried to jerk him to his 
feet. He seemed hopelessly entangled. 
Roldan extricated himself, knowing that 
he was comparatively safe, as bears prefer 
horse-meat to man's. He had no sooner 
got his feet free of the boots than the 
mustang leaped to his feet and fled like a 
hare, dragging the lariat in a straight line 
after him. 

Roldan was alone, the bear not ten 
yards away. The rest of his party were a 
mile and more behind. No one appar 
ently had noticed his flight with the solitary bear. The light was uncertain and 
the excitement over there intense. 

Roldan took to his agile young heels. 
But the bear gathered himself and leaped, 
not once but several times. There was 
no doubt that his blood was up, and that 
he meant a duel to the death. Roldan 
turned with a catching of what breath was 
left in him. He mechanically drew his 
knife from its pocket and flourished it at 


the advancing bear. Bruin cared as little 
for steel as for rope. He came on with a 
mighty growl. 

Roldan gave one rapid glance about. 
There was not even a tree in sight. From 
his point of departure an object seemed 
approaching, but it was too dark to tell as 
yet whether it was a horseman or another 
bear. The brute was almost on him, pant 
ing mightily. All the senses between 
Roldan's skeleton and his skin concen 
trated in the determination to live. He 
sprang forward and plunged his long 
knife into the protruding injected eye of 
the bear, then leaped aside, his dripping 
knife in his hand, and danced about the 
maddened beast with the agility of a 
modern prize-fighter. The bear, too, 
danced, as if obsessed by some infernal 
music ; and the skipping, and leaping, and 
dodging, and waltzing of these two would 
have been ludicrous had it not been a 
matter of life and horrid death. Through 
it all Roldan was vaguely conscious of 
approaching hoof beats, but there was no 
room in his consciousness for hope or 



 

despair. He was not even aware that he 
was panting as if his lungs and throat 
were bursting, nor even that his vision was 
a trifle blurred from constant and rapid 
change of focus and surcharged veins. 
But he executed his dance of life as unerringly as if fresh from his bed and bath. 
The bear, a clumsy creature at best, and 
streaming and blinded with his blood, was 
slackening a little, but there was life in 
him yet, and twice its measure of vengeance. Suddenly he lay down, but be 
came so abruptly inert that Roldan was 
not deceived. Instead of putting himself 
within reach of those waiting arms he fled 
with all his strength. It was then that he 
knew how fully that strength was spent: 
his lungs and legs refused to work with his 
will and impulse after the first hundred 
yards, and he fell to the ground with a 
sensation of utter indifference, longing only 
for physical rest. He heard the bear 
plunging after, the loud sound of a horse's 
hoofs, mingled with a single shout, then 
gave up his consciousness. 

He awoke in a few moments. Adan 


was bending over him, propping his head. 
" The bear ? " he demanded, ashamed of 
the pitiful quality of his voice. 

" I came just in time to rope him," 
replied Adan. " You were a fool, my 
friend, to go off alone like that but very 
brave," he added hastily, knowing that 
Roldan did not like criticism. 

" You are quite right. And this is the 
second time you and your lariat have 
saved me. Perhaps it may be the other 
way some time." 

" Likely it will if you go on hunting for 
adventures as the old women hunt for 
fleas of a night. Do you feel able to 
get on my horse ? It will carry the two 
of us." 

" If I were not equal to that much I 
should find another bear and go to sleep 
in his arms." 



XVIII 

AT last the night arrived for the 
gold quest. The guests had gone. 
Roldan, A dan, and Rafael were alone on 
their side of the great house. They 
waited, kicking their heels together with 
leashed impatience, until eleven o'clock. 
The family and servants of Casa Encarnacion went to bed at ten o'clock, but 
it was the custom of Don Tiburcio to 
go the rounds a half or three quarters 
of an hour later and see that his strict 
laws were as strictly obeyed. To-night, 
when he opened the doors of the three 
young dons in succession, heels were 
still, and breathing was as monotonous as 
his own would be an hour later. At 
eleven the boys dressed and swung from 
their windows, not daring to leave by the 
courtyard. Nor did they dare go to the 
corral and abstract three horses. Much 



 

to their distaste, for there was nothing the 
California!! hated so much as to travel on 
two legs, they were obliged to walk the 
miles between the Casa and the hills. But 
their legs were young and their brains 
eager; in little over an hour they were in 
sight of the Mission. 

It looked very white and ghostly in the 
pale blaze of the moon, a huge mass, full 
of prayer and discontent. Close beside it, 
but without the walls, the Indians slept in 
the rancheria, quiescent enough, for they 
had no Anastacio. At midnight the great 
bells in the tower had rung out, filling the 
valley with their sweet silver clamour ; but 
as the boys approached and skirted the 
wall, some distance to the right, the Mission might have been as lifeless as it is 
this year, in its desertion and decay. 

The hills were a mile behind. The 
Mission, like all of its kind, stood on a 
broad open, that no hostile tribe might 
approach unseen. Cows and horses lay 
in their first heavy sleep, their breathing 
hardly ruffling the profound stillness. So 
great an air of repose did the silent walls 



 

and sleeping beasts give to the landscape 
that the boys felt the quiet of the night as 
they had not done in the other valley, and 
drew closer together, almost holding their 
breath lest the priests might hear it. A 
quarter of an hour later they were among 
the hills and standing before the aperture 
whose secrets were known only to Padre 
Osuna. They glanced at each other out 
of the corners of their eyes. Brave as 
they were, they did not altogether like the 
idea of a possible encounter with a rattle 
snake or a bear in the dark and narrow 
confines of a cave. And if there should 
be another earthquake ! However, they 
had not come to turn back, and Roldan 
pushed boldly in, the others following 
close. 

For a time their way lay along a narrow 
passage. They had made two abrupt turns 
before they dared to light the lantern they 
had brought. When Rafael did, it revealed 
nothing but earthy walls and the imprint 
of feet on the ground. After a little, 
however, the passage suddenly widened, 
and it was Adan who uttered the first exclamation of surprise. It was, indeed, a 
hoarse gurgle. The walls were veined 
with what appeared to be irregular bands 
of dirty crystal, pricked with glittering 
yellow There were, perhaps, a thousand 
of these little points bared from the jealous 
earth, and they shone with a steady baleful 
glare, magnetising six youthful eyes, stir 
ring in three careless brains the ghosts of 
ancient gold-lust, whose concrete substance 
lay in the marble vaults of Spain. Immediately Roldan's sympathy went out to 
the priest ; and he knew that that com 
manding intelligence could teach him one 
thing the less. 

There was a rough pick on the ground, 
and many junks of quartz. Roldan struck 
and rubbed two pieces together. In a 
moment his palm was filled with jagged 
pieces of yellow metal. He blew on them 
lovingly, then put them in his pocket. 

" Dios de mi alma ! " gasped Rafael, 
whose eyes were bulging from his head. 
" It is as beautiful as the stars of the sky, 
the stars in the milky way with the film 
over them." 

" But we need no more stars," said Adan. 
" We shall take away our pockets full, but 
what shall we do with it ? Surely this will 
not made to rot with the earth. But it is 
too small for what you call money, if that 
is so big as you say, Roldan. It would 
make fine nails for a church door." 

" Now is not the time to think what you 
will do with it," said Roldan. "It is 
enough that we have it to get. Much is 
very loose in the crystal. Rub free all 
that you can, and fill every pocket. We 
will take all we can carry away, and come 
again and again. Some day, when we are 
men, perhaps, we will find a use for it. I 
for one do not believe that anything that 
makes you love it can do harm. Does 
not the Church teach us to love all things ? 
Now let us work and not talk." 

The boys in turn hacked out great 
pieces of quartz and rubbed the free gold 
loose. Much of it could only be crushed 
out in machinery made for the purpose, 
but a sufficient quantity of the quartz was 
poor and soft. As the boys worked, they 
grew more and more silent, more and more 



 

absorbed. They forgot their delight in 
rodeo, coliar, bear-hunts, bull-fights, riding 
about the ranches from morning till noon, 
the race, the religious processions, the 
dulces of their mothers cooks. A new 
and mighty passion possessed them, the 
strongest they had ever known. Their 
lips were pressed hard together those 
soft Spanish lips that were usually half 
apart their eyes glowed with a steady 
fire. Their chests rose and fell in short 
regular spasms. 

Suddenly a thrill ran through Roldan. 
He had felt it before when a rattlesnake, 
ready to strike, had fixed its green malig 
nant eyes upon him. He flashed the lan 
tern about swiftly, twisting his neck with 
deep anxiety. It would be no minor adventure to encounter a coiled rattler in 
this narrow place. Then he saw some 
thing white shining out of the darkness 
high above the rays, a large white disk, in 
which glittered two points of light inexpressibly infuriate. 

Roldan sprang to his feet with a warning cry. The other boys, greed routed by 
  

the danger sense, were on their feet as 
quickly. As the three lads, none very tall 
for his age, faced the gigantic bulk of the 
priest, they looked cornered and helpless. 

The priest, unconsciously beyond doubt, 
lifted his huge hands, opening and shutting 
them slowly. The movement had an ugly 
significance, and the hands, in the miser 
able glimmer of light, looked like great 
bats, and seemed to pervade the cavern. 
Involuntarily the boys squirmed. Then 
Roldan, mindful always of his proud posi 
tion as captain of his small band, stepped 
in front of that band and spoke with a 
vocal control that did him much credit, 
considering that his heart seemed to be 
kicking in the middle of his stomach. 

" These hills are just beyond the Mission 
grant, Padre Osuna," he said. " Nor are 
they on any rancho. Therefore what is in 
them is as much ours as any man's. This 
is the first time that we have been here, 
but it will not be the last ; and when I am 
the governor of all the Californias, I shall 
send many Indians to dig the very heart 
out of these hills. So pick out all that 



 

you can now, Padre Osuna, for ten years 
hence " 

As he spoke fear gave place to exulta 
tion in finding himself pitted against a man 
whom he intuitively respected more than 
any he had ever met, and whom he knew 
most men feared and none understood. 
Moreover, he heard two sets of teeth clattering behind him, and that alone would 
have sent the blood of a born leader of 
men back to its skin. 

But his speech did not proceed to the 
finish. The priest swooped down and 
caught the three necks between his hands, 
easily spanning them, pressing the heads 
hard together. Then he lifted the boys 
high in the air and held them there, a 
kicking, humiliated trio. The blanched 
olive of his face was reflected in the pallid 
brows at the extremity of his rigid arms. 
His voice, which had been lost in passion, 
found itself. 

"And when your Indians come, Senor 
Don Roldan," he said, " they will find three 
skeletons six feet beneath the floor of this 
cave. You will never leave this cave, not 

 

one of you. When you are dead for want 
of food and drink, I shall return and bury 
you. And no one will seek you here." 
Suddenly he dashed them to the ground. 
" A thousand curses go with you," he 
shrieked, " to make a murderer of me. I 
was near enough to hell before " 

" And our fingers will scratch the 
ground beneath your feet," interrupted 
Roldan, who between mortification and 
rage felt equal himself to murder, but 
determined as ever to hold his own. " Our 
skulls will grin at you from every corner 
as you work " 

" I don't care ! " shouted the priest. " I 
don't care ! Here you rot. This gold is 
mine. No man shall touch it but myself." 

" But if we promise never to return, and 
to tell no man of what we know," interposed Rafael, feebly. 

The priest laughed. " With the glitter 
of gold in your brains? You could not 
keep an oath on the cross." He turned 
swiftly and strode down the passage. 

" What will he do ? " gasped Adan. 

" Roll a stone over the entrance and 



 

secure it with others," said Roldan. " There 
are plenty nigh. If we follow, he will beat 
us back with those fists, and one blow 
would crack our skulls in two." 

" Then what shall we do ? Rot here ? 
Starve to death ? Madre de dios ! " 

" We have been between the teeth of 
death before, have we not? We shall 
have many more adventures, my friends. 

But although he spoke confidently he 
was profoundly disturbed. This was no 
ordinary predicament. He knew that 
unless the priest relented they stood small 
chance of seeing sun and stars again. 
Would he relent ? Roldan's own indomitable will and growing ambitions responded to the awful forces in the man, 
overgrown and abnormal as they had 
become. That the priest had some great 
end in view to which this gold was the 
means, and that the gold itself had roused 
in him a controlling passion, he could not 
doubt. The priest himself had told him 
something, the gold the rest. With a sudden impulse of hatred Roldan emptied his 
pockets of the metal and stamped upon it. 


 

He quieted suddenly, then stamped again, 
with added vigour. Then he dropped and 
laid his ear to the ground. 

"Stamp, Adan," he said, "and hard." 
Adan shook his blood through his veins, 
and obeyed. Rolclan sprang to his feet. 
" We are above the tunnel of the Mis 
sion," he said. " And we have a pickaxe. 
All we have to do is to dig." 



XIX 

IT was three hours later that a mass of 
loosened earth caved suddenly, carry 
ing Adan with it. A wild yell came 
back. It stopped abruptly, the tag end of 
it shot forth like the quick last blast from 
a trumpet. 

"Hi, Adan!" called Roldan, excitedly, 
peering down into the dark. " Are you 
hurt ? " 

" I know not ! I know not ! It is darker 
than a dungeon of a Mission." The voice 
was quite distinct. It came from no great 
depth. 

u Get out of the way," called Roldan. " I 
am coming." He waited a moment, then 
dropped, falling on a mass of soft earth. 
Adan had prudently retreated a few steps. 
He ran forward and helped Roldan to his 
feet, just as Rafael came flying down. 



 

" Now for the other end," said Roldan. 
" This air is not too good. And that devil 
may return any moment." 

They ran down the tunnel. It was wide 
and high, built for flying priests, should 
the Mission be besieged and captured by 
savage tribes. The air was close and 
heavy, but free from noxious gases. Bats 
whirred past and rats scampered before 
them. Roldan paused after a moment 
and lit his lantern. Its thin ray leaped 
but a few feet ahead, but would frighten 
away any wild beast of the forest that 
might have wandered in. 

The tunnel was straight. It also appeared to be endless. 

" We have walked twenty leagues," 
groaned Adan, at the end of an hour. 

u Two," said Roldan. " Without doubt 
this tunnel ends at the mountains, and 
they are four leagues from the Mission. 
But you have taken longer walks than 
this, my friend. Do you remember that 
night in the mountains?" 

" I had forgotten it for one blessed 
week. Rafael, to what have we brought 



 

you ? Your poor muscles are soft, where 
ours are now as hard as a deserter's from 
an American barque ay, yi ! " 

u If they have but the chance to become 
soft once more after they too are hard ! " 
muttered Rafael, who was panting and 
lagging. "That priest ! that priest ! " 

" It is true," said Roldan, pausing 
abruptly. " You will not dare to return 
home at present nor we. It is flight once 
more to Los Angeles. We will stay 
there where he would not dare touch us 
if he came until he repents or makes sure 
that we will have told if we intend to tell. 
Will you come? " 

" Will I ? I would go to Mexico if I 
could. I feel that there is not room in the 
Californias for those hands and myself." 

" I will take care of you," said Roldan, 
proudly, anxious to rout the memory of his 
recent humiliation. " But come." And 
Rafael, too weary and bewildered to resent 
the authority of his erst-while rival, trudged 
obediently in the rear. 

" It grows colder," said Adan, significantly. 



 

"Yes," said Roldan. "We near the 



mountains." 



Adan stopped. " Is it the mountains 
again?" he asked. "If it is, then I, for 
one, prefer the priest." 

" The mountains never scared you half 
as badly as the priest did," said Roldan, 
cruelly. " And to say nothing of the fact 
that we need never get lost in the mountains again, the embrace of a grizzly 
would be no harder and more death-sure 
than one in the great arms of that fiend 
that wears a cassock." 

" True. You are always right. But 
promise that whatever happens you will 
not lead us into the Sierras." 

" I promise," said Roldan, much flat 
tered by this unconscious tribute to his 
leadership. 

" Do you think that priest is really a 
devil?" asked Rafael, in an awestruck 
voice. 

" When a man has insulted you, you do 
not know what you think of him," said 
Roldan, flushing hotly. " If he only were 
not a priest I'd fight him, big as he is. 



 

But at least I can outwit him. It consoles 
me to think of his fury when he goes to 
the cave and finds us gone." 

" We'd better get out of this tunnel 
before we talk about having the best of 
the priest, * said Adan. " Suppose he returns to kill us himself " 

" He will not return until to-morrow. 
Then he will have repented. He will 
promise to let us go free if we keep his 
secret. But he will not have that satis 
faction, my friends. Yesterday he had a 
friend in Roldan Castanada ; I would have 
done anything for him, gladly kept his 
secret. But to-day he has an enemy that 
he will do well to fear. A Spaniard 
never forgets an insult." 

" What shall you do ? " asked Rafael, 
eagerly. " Expose him ? " 

" No, I do nothing mean. But I proclaim at Los Angeles that gold has been 
discovered in the Californias, and in six 
days the hills will swarm, and the priest in 
his cell will gnash his teeth." 

" Ay ! " exclaimed Adan. " Do you fed 
that?" 



 

An icy blast swept down the tunnel, 
roughening skin and shortening breath. 
A few moments later the low rhythm as of 
distant water came to their ears. Roldan 
and Adan recognised that familiar music, 
and set their teeth. 

" And I prayed that I might never see 
another redwood," muttered Adan, cross 
ing himself. 

The tunnel stopped abruptly. They 
stood before a mass of brushwood, piled 
thickly to keep out wild beasts and delude 
the searching eye of hostile Indians. Be 
yond, seen in patches, was a dazzle of 
white. 

" Snow, of course," said Adan, with a 
groan. 

The boys pulled the branches apart 
without much difficulty: the priests had 
studied facility of egress and had raised 
the barrier from within. In a few moments the boys stood in the sunlight ; 
and the mountains hemmed them in. 

Adan stamped his foot savagely on the 
hard snow. u We are where we started a 
week ago," he said. " No more, no less." 



 

" No," said Roldan, who also had felt 
demoralised for a moment. "The priests 
were too clever for that. They would 
want to get into the shelter of the mountains, no more. I believe that from the 
top of that point above the tunnel we can 
see the valley." 

" Well, we can at least look," said Rafael, 
who was bitterly weary and hungry, but 
determined not to be outdone by these 
hardened adventurers. 

The boys made their way up the de 
clivity as best they could through the 
heavy snowdrifts, pulling themselves up 
by clutching at young trees and scrub. 
They were thinly clad and very cold, and 
hunger was loud of speech. When after 
a half-hour's weary climb, they reached 
the summit, they drew a long sigh of 
relief, but their enthusiasm was too moderate for words in present physical conditions. The valley lay below. Far away, 
beyond leagues of low hills and wide 
valleys something white reflected the sun. 
It was the Mission. 

" We have not a moment to rest, unless 



 

we can find a safe hiding-place," said 
Roldan. " If he should return and find us 
gone, he would follow at once." 

" Where shall we go ? " asked the others, 
who, however, felt a quickening of blood 
and muscle at the thought that the priest 
might be under their feet even then. 

" How near is the next rancho, and 
whose is it ? " 

" A league beyond the Mission grant. 
It is Don Juan Ortegas." 

" Very well, we go there and ask for 
horses." 

The boys made their way rapidly down 
the slope, which after all was only that of 
a foot-hill. Beyond were other foot-hills, 
and they skirted among them, finally enter 
ing a canon. It was as dark and cold and 
damp as the last hour of the tunnel had 
been, but the narrow river, roaring through 
its middle, had caught all the snow, and 
there was scarce a fleck on the narrow 
tilted banks. The hill opposite was the 
last of the foot-hills; but how to reach it? 
The current was very swift, and boys 
knew naught of the art of swimming in 
that land of little water. 



 

Suddenly Roldan raised his hand with 
an exclamation of surprise and pointed to 
a ledge overhanging the stream. A hut 
stood there, made of sections of the red 
wood and pine. From its chimney, 
smoke was curling upward. 

The boys were too hungry to pause and 
reflect upon the possibility of a savage 
inmate ; they scrambled up the bank and 
ran along the ledge to the hut. The 
door was of hide. They knocked. There 
was no response. They flung the door 
aside and entered. No one was in the 
solitary room of the hut, but over a fire in 
the deep chimney place hung a large pot, 
in which something of agreeable savour 
bubbled. 

Roldan glanced about. " I'd rather be 
invited," he said doubtfully. 

But Adan had gone straight for the pot. 
He lifted it off the fire, fetched three 
broken plates and battered knives and 
forks from a shelf, and helped his friends 
and himself. Then he piously crossed 
himself and fell to. It was not in human 
necessities to withstand the fragrance of 



 

that steaming mess of squirrel, and the 
boys had disposed of the entire potful 
before they raised their eyes again. When 
they did, Rafael, who sat opposite the 
door, made a slight exclamation, and the 
others turned about quickly. A man stood 
there. 

He was quite unlike any one they had 
ever seen. A tall lank man with rounded 
shoulders, lean leather-like cheeks, a 
preternatural length of jaw, drab hair and 
chin whiskers, and deeply-set china-blue 
eyes, made up a type uncommon in the 
Californias, that land of priest, soldier, 
caballero, and Indian. He was clad in 
coyote skins, and carried a gun in his 
hand, a brace of rabbits slung over one 
shoulder. He did not speak for some 
seconds, and when he did, it was to make 
a remark that was not understood. He 
said: "Well, I'll be durned ! " 

His expression was not forbidding, and 
Roldan recovered himself at once. He 
stood up and bowed profoundly. 

" Seiior," he said, " I beg that you will 
pardon us. We would have craved your 



 

hospitality had you been here, but as it 
was, our hunger overcame us : we have not 
eaten for many hours. But I am Roldan 
Castanada of the Rancho de los Palos 
Verdes, senor, and I beg that you will one 
day let me repay your hospitality in the 
house of my fathers." 

" Holy smoke ! " exclaimed the man, " all 
that high-falutin lingo for a potful of 
squirril. But you're welcome enough. I 
don't begrudge anybody sup." Then he 
broke into a laugh at the puzzled faces of 
his guests, and translated his reply into 
very lame Spanish. The boys, however, 
were delighted to be so hospitably received, 
and grinned at him, warm, replete, and 
sheltered. 

The man began at once to skin a 
rabbit. " Seein as how you haint left 
me nothin , I may as well turn to," he said. 
"And it ain't every day I'm entertainin 
lords." 

The boys did not understand the words, 
but they understood the act, and reddened. 

" I myself will cook the rabbit for you,
