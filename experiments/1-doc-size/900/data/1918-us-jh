train that went through his back yard, carrying materials for 
the making of TNT. 

For the great explosives plant was now working day and 
night, keeping the war in Jimmie's thoughts all the time, 
whether he would or not. In the midnight hours the trains of 
finished materials went out, making Jimmie's windows rattle 
with their rumble and clatter, and bearing his fancies away to 
the battle-line across the seas, where men were soon to be blown 
to pieces with the contents of these cars. One night something 
went wrong on the track, and the train stopped in his back yard, 
and in the morning he saw the cars, painted black, with the 
word "Danger" in flaming red letters. On top of the cars 
walked a man with a club in his hand and a bulge on his hip, 
keeping guard. 

It appeared that some one had torn up a rail in the night, 
evidently for the purpose of wrecking the train; so there came 
a detective to Jimmie, while he was working in the field, to 
cross-question him. They had Jimmie's record, and suspected 
him of knowing more than he would tell. "Aw, go to hell!" 
exclaimed the irate Socialist. "D'you suppose, if I'd wanted 
to smash anything, I'd 'a done it on the place where I work?" 
And then, when he went home to dinner, he found that they 
had been after Lizzie, and had frightened her out of her wits. 
They had threatened to turn them out of their home; Jimmie 
saw himself hounded here and there by this accursed war 
until it finished by seizing him and dragging him to the 
trenches I

The new Congress had met, and declared a state of war 
with Germany, and the whole country was rushing into arms. 
Men were enlisting by hundreds of thousands; but that was 
not enough for the militarists they wanted a conscription-law, 
so that every man might be compelled to go. If they were so 
sure of themselves and their wonderful war, why weren't they 
satisfied to let those fight it who wanted to ? So argued the 
rebellious Jimmie and his anti-militarist associates. But no! 
the militarists knew perfectly well that the bulk of the people 
did not want to fight, so they proposed to make them fight. 
Every energy of the Socialist movement was now concentrated 
on the blocking of this conscription scheme. 




Local Leesville hired the Opera-house again, organising a 
mass-meeting of protest, and the capitalist papers of the city 
began clamouring against this meeting. Was the patriotism 
and loyalty of Leesville to be affronted by another gathering of 
sedition and treason? The "Herald" told all over again the 
story of the gallant old civil war veteran who had risen in his 
seat and shouted his protest against the incitements of "Jack" 
Smith, the notorious "red" editor. The "Herald" printed a 
second time the picture of the gallant old veteran in his faded 
blue uniform, and the list of battles in which he had fought, 
from the first Bull Run to the last siege of Richmond. Some 
farmer passing by handed a copy of this paper to Lizzie, adding 
that if there was any more treason-talk in this locality there 
was going to be a lynching-bee. So Jimmie found his wife in 
tears again. She was absolutely determined that he should not 
go to that meeting. For three days she wept and argued with 
him, and for a part of three nights. 

It would have been comical if it had not been so tragic. Jim- 
mie would use the old argument, that if he did not succeed in 
stopping the war, he would be dragged into the trenches and 
killed. So, of course, Lizzie would become a pacifist at once. 
What right had the war to take Jimmie from her? The little 
Jimmies had a right to their father ! All children had a right 
to their fathers! But then, after Lizzie had expressed these 
tearful convictions, Jimmie would say, All right, then he must 
go to that meeting, he must do what he could to prevent the 
war. And poor Lizzie would find herself suddenly confronting 
the terrors of the police with their clubs and the patriots with 
their buckets of tar and bags of feathers! No, Jimmie must 
not carry on any propaganda, Jimmie must not go to the meet- 
ing ! Poor Jimmie would try to pin her down : which way did 
she want him killed, by the Germans, or by the police and the 
mobs? But Lizzie did not want him killed either way! She 
wanted him to go on living! 

Jimmie would try to arrange a compromise for the present. 
He would go to the meeting, but he would promise not to say 
a word. But that did not console Lizzie she knew that if 
anything happened, her man would get into it. No, if he were 
determined to go, she would go too even if they had to load 
the three babies into the perambulator, and push them two or 
three miles to the trolley ! If Jimmie tried to make a speech,. 





she would -hang onto his coat-tails, she would clasp her hands 
over his mouth, she would throw herself between him and the 
clubs of the policemen! 

So matters stood, when on the afternoon before the meeting 
there came a heavy rain, and the road to the trolley was ren- 
dered impossible for a triple-loaded baby-carriage. So there 
were more hysterics in the family; Jimmie took his wife's hand 
in his and solemnly swore to her that she might trust him to 
go to this meeting, he would not do anything that could by any 
possibility get him into trouble. He would not try to make 
a speech, he would not get up and shout no matter what hap- 
pened, he would not say a word! He would merely sell 
pamphlets, and show people to their seats, as he had done at a 
hundred meetings before. To make sure of his immunity, he 
would even leave off the red badge which he was accustomed 
to display on Socialist occasions! By these pledges repeated 
over and over, he finally succeeded in pacifying his weeping 
spouse, and gently removed her clutch on his coat-tails, and 
departed, waving his hand to her and the kids. 

The last thing he saw through the rain was Jimmie Junior, 
flourishing a red handkerchief which Lizzie at the last moment 
had extracted from her husband's pocket. The last sound he 
heard was Jimmie Junior's voice, shouting : "You be good now ! 
You shut up I" Jimmie went off, thinking about this little tike ; 
he was five years old, and growing so that you could notice the 
difference over night. He had big black eyes like his mother, 
and a grin full of all the mischief in the world. The things 
he knew and the questions he asked ! Jimmie and Lizzie never 
got tired of talking about them; Jimmie recalled them one 
by one, as he trudged through the mud and, as always, he set 
his lips and clenched his hands, and took up anew the task of 
making the world a fit place for a workingman's child to grow 
up in ! 

Ill 

The principal orator of the evening was a young college 
professor who had been turned out of his job for taking the 
side of the working-class in his public utterances, and who was 
therefore a hero to Jimmie Higgins. This young man had the 
facts of the war at his finger tips; he made you see it as a 




gigantic conspiracy of capitalists the world over to complete 
their grip on the raw materials of wealth, and on the bodies and 
souls of the workers. He bitterly denounced those who had 
forced the country into the war; he denounced the Wall Street 
speculators and financiers who had made their billions already, 
and would be making their tens of billions. He denounced the 
plan to force men to fight who did not wish to fight, and his 
every sentence was followed by a burst of applause from the 
throng which packed the Opera-house. If you judged by this 
meeting, you would conclude that America was on the verge 
of a revolution against the war. 

The young professor sat down, wiping the perspiration from 
his pale forehead; and then the Liederkranz sang again only 
it was not called the Liederkranz now, it had become known as 
the "Workers' Singing Society' out of deference to local preju- 
dice. Then arose Comrade Smith, editor of the "Worker," and 
announced that after the collection the orator would answer 
questions; then Comrade Smith launched into a speech of his 
own, to the effect that something definite ought to be done by 
the workers of Leesville to make clear their opposition to being 
dragged into war. For his part he wished to say that he would 
not yield one inch to the war-clamour he was on record as 
refusing to be drafted in any capitalist war, and he was ready 
to join with others to agree that they would not be drafted. The 
time was short -if anything were to be done, they must act 
at once 

And then suddenly came an interruption this time not from 
an old soldier, but from a sergeant of police who had been stand- 
ing at one side of the stage, and who now stepped forward, 
announcing, "This meeting is closed." 

"What ?" shouted the orator. 

"This meeting is closed," repeated the other. "And you, 
young man, are under arrest." 

There was a howl from the audience, and suddenly from 
the pit in front of the stage, whence ordinarily the orchestra 
dispensed sweet music, there leaped a line of blue-uniformed 
men, distributing themselves between the public and the speaker. 
At the same time down the centre aisle came a dozen soldiers 
marching, with guns in their hands and bayonets fixed. 

"This is an outrage!" shouted Comrade Smith. 

"Not another word!" commanded the police official; and 





two policemen who had followed him grabbed the orator by each 
arm and started to lead him off the stage. 

Comrade Gerrity leaped to the front of the platform. "I 
denounce this proceeding!" he shouted. "We are holding an 
orderly meeting here " 

A policeman laid hold of him. "You are under arrest." 

Then came Comrade Mabel Smith, sister of the editor of the 
"Worker." "For shame ! For shame !" she cried. And then, 
to a policeman, "No, I will not be silent! I protest in the 

name of free speech ! I declare " And when the policeman 

seized her by the arm, she continued to shout at the top of 
her lungs, driving the crowd to frenzy. 

There were disturbances all over the audience. Mrs. Ger- 
rity, wife of the organiser, sprang up in her seat and began to 
protest. It happened that Jimmie Higgins was in the aisle 
not far from her, and his heart leaped with strange, half-for- 
gotten emotions as he saw this trim little figure, with the jaunty 
hat and the turkey-feather stuck on one side. Comrade Evelyn 
Baskerville, of Greenwich Village, she of the fluffy brown hair 
and the pert little dimples and the bold and terrifying ideas, 
she who had so ploughed up the soul of Jimmie Higgins and 
almost broken up the Higgins home here she was, employing 
a new variety of coquetry, by which she compelled three soldiers 
with rifles and bayonets to devote their exclusive attention to 
her! 

And then Comrade Mary Allen, the Quaker lady, who be- 
lieved in moral force applied through the ear-drums. She stood 
in the aisle with her armful of pamphlets and her red sash 
over her shoulder, proclaiming, "In the name of liberty and 
fair play I protest against this outrage! I will not see my 
country dragged into war without asserting my right of protest ! 
I stand here, in what is supposed to be a Christian city; I 

speak in the name of the Prince of Peace " and so on, quite 

a little speech, while several embarrassed young men in khaki 
were trying to find out how to hold their rifles and a shouting 
Quakeress at the same time. 

And then Comrade Schneider, the brewer. He had been 
up on the stage with the singers, and now got somehow to the 
front. "Haf we got no rights in America left?" he shouted. 
"Do we in this audience " 

"Shut up, you Hun!" roared some one in the front of the 



 

crowd, and three policemen at once leaped for Comrade 
Schneider, and grabbed him by the collar, twisting so hard 
that the German's face, always purple when he was excited, 
took on a dark and deadly hue. 

Poor Jimmie Higgins! He stood there with his armful of 
"War, What For?" trembling with excitement, itching in 
every nerve and sinew to leap into this conflict, to make his 
voice heard above the uproar, to play his part as a man or 
even as a Comrade Mabel Smith, or a Comrade Mary Allen, or 
a Comrade Mrs. Gerrity, nee Baskerville. But he was helpless, 
speechless bound hand and foot by those solemn pledges he 
had given to Eleeza Betooser, the mother of babies. 

He looked about, and near him in the aisle he saw another 
man, also bound hand and foot bound by the memory of the 
smash in the face which had broken his nose and knocked out 
three of his front teeth ! "Wild Bill" saw a policeman watch- 
ing him now, eager for another pretext to leap on him and pound 
him; so he was silent, like Jimmie. The two of them had to 
stand there and see the fundamental constitutional rights of 
American citizens set at naught, to see liberty trampled in the 
dust beneath the boots of a brutal soldiery, to see justice 
strangled and raped in the innermost shrine of her temple. 
At least, that was what you had seen if you read the Leesville 
"Worker"; if on the other hand you read the "Herald" which 
nine out of ten people did then you learned that the forces 
of decency and order had at last prevailed in Leesville, the 
propaganda of the Hun was stifled forever, the mouthers of 
sedition had felt the heavy hand of public indignation. 

IV 

Outside, a crowd gathered to jeer while the prisoners were 
loaded into the patrol-wagon; but the police drove them away, 
keeping everybody moving, and breaking up several attempts at 
street-oratory. Jimmie found himself with half a dozen other 
comrades, wandering aimlessly down Main Street, talking over 
and over what had happened, each explaining why and how he 
had not shared the crown of martyrdom. Some had shouted as 
loud as the rest, but had been missed by the police; some had 
thought it wiser to run away and live to shout another day; 
some wanted to start that very night to print a leaflet and call 





another mass-meeting. They adjourned to Tom's "Buffeteria" 
to talk things over; they took possession of a couple of tables, 
and got their due quotas of coffee and sandwiches, or pie and 
milk, and had just got fairly started on the question of raising 
bail without the help of Comrade Dr. Service when suddenly 
something happened which drove all thoughts of the meeting 
out of their minds. 

It was like a gigantic blow, striking the whole world at 
once ; a cosmic convulsion, quite indescribable. The air became 
suddenly a living thing, which leaped against your face; the 
windows of the little eating-place flew inward in a shower of 
glass, and the walls and tables shook as if with palsy. The 
sound of it all was a vast, all-pervasive sound, at once far off 
and near, tailing away in the clatter and crash of innumerable 
panes of glass falling from innumerable windows. Then came 
silence, a sinister, frightful silence, it seemed; men stared at 
one another, crying, "My God! What's that?" The answer 
seemed to dawn upon every one at once: "The powder-plant!" 

Yes, that must be it, beyond doubt. For months they had 
been talking about it and thinking about it, speculating as to 
the probabilities and the consequences. And now it had hap- 
pened. Suddenly one of the company gave a cry, and they 
turned and stared at his white face, and realised the terror that 
clutched his heart. Comrade Higgins, whose home was so near 
the place of peril ! 

"Gee, fellers, I gotta go!" he gasped; and several of the 
comrades jumped up and ran with him into the street. If 
there was a single pane of glass left intact in Leesville, you 
would not have thought it as you trod those side-walks. 

If Jimmie had been trained in efficiency, and accustomed to 
spending money more freely, he might perhaps have found out 
something by the telephone or by inquiry at the newspaper- 
offices; but the one thing he thought of was to take the trolley 
and get to his home. The comrades ran with him, speculating 
with eager excitement, trying to reassure him it could be 
nothing worse than some glass and some dishes smashed. Some 
had thought of going all the way with him, but they remembered 
they would be too late for the last trolley back, and they had 
their jobs in the morning. So they put him on the car and 
bade him good-bye. 



 



The trolley was packed with people going out to see what 
had happened, so Jimmie had plenty of company and conversa- 
tion on the way. But when he came to his stop, he got off 
and walked alone, for the others were going to the explosives 
plant, and they rode a mile or so farther on the car. 

Never would Jimmie forget that journey that walk of 
nightmares. The road was pitch-dark, and before he had gone 
more than half the distance, he stumbled over something, and 
fell head-foremost. He got up, and groped, and discovered that 
it was a tree, lying prone across the road. He searched his 
mind, and remembered a great dead tree that stood at that 
spot. Could the explosion have knocked it down? 

He went on, feeling his way more cautiously, yet goaded to 
greater speed by his fears. A little way farther was a farm- 
house, and he went into the yard and shouted, but got no reply. 
The yard was covered with shingles, apparently blown from the 
roof. He went on, more frightened than ever. 

He came to a turn in the road which he knew was less than 
half a mile from his home; and here there were several horses 
and wagons tied, but no one to answer his calls. The road 
passed through a wood; but apparently there was no road any 
more the trees had been picked up bodily and thrown across 
it. Jimmie had to grope this way and that, and he ran a piece 
of broken branch into his cheek, and by that time was almost 
ready to cry with fright. He knew that his home was two miles 
from the explosives plant, and he could not conceive how an 
explosion could have done such damage at such a distance. 

He saw a lantern ahead, bobbing this way and that, and he 
shouted louder than ever, and finally succeeded in persuading 
the bearer of the lantern to wait for him. It proved to be a 
farmer who lived some ways back ; he knew no more than Jimmie 
did, and they made their way together. Beyond the woods, the 
road was littered with loose dirt, bushes, bits of fence and 
rubbish, burned black. "It must have been near here," de- 
clared the man, and added words which caused Jimmie's heart 
almost to stand still, "It must have been on the railroad-track I" 

They came to a little rise, from which in day-time the line 
of the railroad was visible. They saw lanterns, many of them, 
moving here and there like a swarm of fire-flies. "Come this. 





way," Jimmie begged of the farmer, and ran toward his home. 
The road was buried under masses of earth, as if thousands of 
steam-shovels had emptied their contents on it. When they 
came to where the fence of Jimmie's house ought to have been, 
they found no fence, but a slide of loose earth that had never 
been there before. Where the apple-tree had been there was 
nothing ; where the lawn had been there was a pitch down a hill, 
and where the house had been was a huge valley, seeming in the 
darkness a bottomless abyss ! 



VI 

Jimmie was distracted. He grabbed the lantern from the 
other man, and ran this way and that, looking for some of the 
familiar land-marks of his home the chicken-house, the pig- 
sty, the back fence with the broken elm tree in the corner, the 
railroad beyond. He could not believe that he had come to the 
place at all he could not credit the reality of such night-mare 
sights as his eyes reported to him. He rushed about, stumbling 
over mountains of upheaved brown dirt, sliding down into 
craters that were filled with a strange penetrating odour which 
caused his eyes to smart; and then clambering out again and 
running after men with lanterns, shouting questions at them 
and not waiting for an answer. It seemed to him that if he 
ran just a little farther he must surely find the house and the 
other things he was looking for; but he found nothing but 
more craters and more mountains of dirt; and little by little 
the horrible truth became clear to him, that all the way down 
the railroad-track, as far as he could see or run, this gigantic 
trough extended, a valley of raw dirt with mountains on each 
side, crowned here and there with wheels and axles and iron 
trucks of blown-up freight-cars, and filled in the bottom with 
the deadly fumes of trinitrotoluol ! 

Jimmie cried out to the men and women with lanterns, ask- 
ing had they seen his wife and babies. But no one had seen 
them no one had notified them of the impending explosion ! 
Jimmie was sobbing, calling out distractedly; he ran out to the 
road, and after much searching found a charred tree-stump 
which gave him his precise bearings, so that he knew where 
the house should have been, and could assure himself that it 
was precisely where that frightful slope started down into the 



 

abyss. He slid around on this slope, calling aloud, as if he 
expected the spirits of his loved ones might have remained 
there, defying all the power of suddenly expanding gases. He 
ran back across the road and called, as if they might have fled 
that way. 

At last he ran into Mr. Drew; old Mr. Drew, who a couple 
of weeks before had taken Eleeza Betooser and her three little 
ones driving in his buggy! That memory was the nearest 
Jimmie could get to them, and so he clutched the old soldier's 
arm, and held on to it, weeping like a little child. 

The old man tried to draw him away, to get him to his home. 
But Jimmie must stay on the spot, he was held by a spell of 
horror. He wandered about, dragging Mr. Drew with him, 
pleading with people to no purpose; now and then he would 
break out with curses against war-makers, and especially those 
who made explosives and transported them in freight-trains 
through other men's back yards. For once people heard him 
without threats of lynching. 

So on through this night of anguish. Jimmie lost old man 
Drew in the darkness, and was all alone when the dawn came, 
and he could see the sweep of desolation about him, and the 
awe-stricken faces of the spectators. Soon afterwards came the 
climax. He saw a crowd gathered, and as he came up, this 
crowd parted for him. Nobody seemed to want to speak, but 
they all watched, as if curious to see what he would do. One 
of the men bore a burden, wrapped in a horse-blanket; Jimmie 
gazed, and after a moment's hesitation the man threw back 
part of the blanket, and there before Jimmie's eyes was a most 
horrible sight a human leg, a large white leg, the lower half 
covered with a black stocking tied at the top with a bit of 
tape. It was such a leg as you see in the windows of stores 
where they sell pretty things for ladies; only this leg was soft, 
mangled at the top, smeared with blood, and partly charred 
black. One glance was enough for Jimmie, and he put his 
hands over his eyes and turned and ran out to the road and 
away, away anywhere from this place of nightmares ! 



VII 

Jimmie's whole world was wiped out, ended. He had no 
place to go, no care what became of him. He stumbled on 





till he came to the trolley-track, and got on the first car which 
came along. It was pure chance that it happened to be going 
back to Leesville, for Jimmie had no longer any interest in 
that city. When the car came to the barn, he got out and 
wandered aimlessly, until he happened to pass a saloon where 
he had been accustomed to meet Jerry 'Coleman, distributor of 
ten dollar bills. Jimmie went in and ordered a drink of 
whiskey; he did not tell the saloon-keeper what had happened, 
but took the drink to a table and sat down by himself. When 
he had finished, he ordered another, because it helped him not 
to think ; he sat there at the table, drinking steadily for an hour 
or more. And so upon his confused mind there dawned a 
strange, a ghastly idea, climax of all that night of horror. 
Which leg of Lizzie was it the man had been carrying wrapped 
in a horse-blanket? The right leg or the left? If it was the 
left leg, why, nothing; but if it was the right, why then, under 
the stocking was sewed a bandage, and in that bandage was 
wrapped a package containing seven faded yellow twenty dollar 
bills! 

And what would they do about it? Would they bury the 
leg without investigation ? Or would the man who had found 
it happen to undress it? And what was Jimmie to do? A 
hundred and forty dollars was not to be sneezed at by a work- 
ing-man it was more money than he had ever had in his life 
before, or might ever have again. But could he go to the 
man and say, "Did you find any money on my wife's leg?" 
Could he say, "Please give me my wife's leg, so that I can 
undress it and unsew the bandage, and get the money that I was 
paid for keeping quiet about the surgical operation on Lacey 
Granitch, that was done in my house before it was blown to 
pieces by the explosion." 

Jimmie thought it all over while he took a couple more 
drinks, and finally settled it to himself : "Aw hell ! What do I 
want with money? I ain't a-goin' to live no more !" 






TMMIE HIGGINS was wandering down the street, when he 
 ran into "Wild Bill," who was, of course, greatly surprised 
to see his friend in a drunken condition. When he heard the 
reason, he revealed an unexpected side of his nature. If you 
judged "Wild Bill" by his oratory, you thought him a creature 
poisoned through and through, a soul turned rancid with envy, 
hatred and malice and all uncharitableness. But now the tears 
came into his eyes, and he put his arm over Jimmie's shoulder. 
"Say, old pal, that's bum luck! By God, I'm sorry!" And 
Jimmie, who wanted nothing so much as somebody to be sorry 
with, clasped Bill in his arms, and burst into tears, and told 
over and over again how he had gone to what had been his 
home, and found only a huge crater blown out by the explosion, 
and how he had gone about calling his wife and babies, until 
at last they had brought him one leg of his wife. 

"Wild Bill" listened, until he knew the story through, and 
then he said, "See here, old pal, let's you and me quit this 
town." 

"Quit?" said Jimmie, stupidly. 

"Every time I open the front of my face now, the police 
jump in it. Leesville's a hell of a town, I say. Let's get out." 

"Where'll we go?" 

"Anywhere what's the diff? It's coming summer. Let's 
slam the gates." 

Jimmie was willing why not? They went back to the 
lodging-house where Bill lived, and he tied up his worldly 
goods in a gunny-sack the greater part of the load consisting 
of a diary in which he had recorded his adventures as leader 
of an unemployed army which had started to march from Cali- 
fornia to Washington, D. C., some four years previously. They 



took the trolley, and getting off in the country, walked along the 
banks of the river, Jimmie still sobbing, and Bill in the grip of 
one of his fearful coughing spells. They sat down beside the 
stream, not so far from where Jimmie had gone in swimming 
with the Candidate; he gave a touching account of this adven- 
ture, but fell asleep in the middle of it, and Bill wandered off 
and begged some food at a farm-house, using his cough as a 
convenient lever for moving the heart of the house-wife. When 
night came, they sought the railroad and got on board a south- 
ward-moving freight ; so Jimmie Higgins went back to the hobo 
life, at which he had spent a considerable part of his youth. 

But there was a difference now; he was no longer a blind 
and helpless victim of a false economic system, but a revolution- 
ist, fully class-conscious, trained in a grim school. The country 
was going to war, and Jimmie was going to war on the country. 
The two agitators got off the train at a mining-village, and 
got a job as "surface-men," and proceeded to preach their gospel 
of revolt to the workers in a lousy company boarding-house. 
When they were found out, they "jumped" another freight, and 
repeated the performance in another part of the district. 

The companies were too vigilant for there to be any chance 
of a strike; but "Wild Bill" whispered to the young workers 
that he knew a trick worth two of that he would teach them 
the art of "striking on the job" ! This idea of course had great 
charm for embittered men ; enabling them to pay back the boss, 
while at the same time continuing on his pay-roll. Bill had 
read whole books in which the theory and practice of "sabotage" 
were worked out, and he could tell any sort of workman tricks 
to make his employer sweat under the collar. If you worked 
in a machine-shop, you dropped emery-powder into the bear- 
ings; if you worked on a farm, you drove copper nails into the 
fruit-trees, which caused them to die; if you packed apples, you 
stuck your thumb-nail into one, which made sure that the whole 
box would be rotten when it arrived ; if you worked in a saw-mill, 
you drove a spike into a log ; if you worked in a restaurant, you 
served double portions to ruin the boss, and spit in each por- 
tion, to make sure the customer did not derive any benefit. 
All these things you did in a fervour of exaltation, a mood of 
frenzied martyrdom, because of the blaze of hate which had been 
fanned in your soul by a social system based upon oppression 
and knavery. 



 



II 

To Jimmie, living the obscure and comparatively peaceful 
life of a Socialist propagandist, the question of "sabotage, vio- 
lence and crime'' had been a more or less academic one, about 
which the comrades debated acrimoniously, and against which 
they voted by a large majority. But now Jimmie was out among 
the "wobblies," the "blanket-stiffs" the unskilled workers who 
had literally nothing but their muscle-power to sell; here he 
was in the front-line trenches of the class war. These men 
wandered about from one job to another, at the mercy of the 
seasons and the fluctuations of industry. They were deprived 
of votes, and therefore of their status as citizens; they were de- 
prived of a chance to organise, and therefore of their status as 
human beings. They were lodged in filthy bunk-houses, fed 
upon rotten food, and beaten or jailed at the least word of 
revolt. So they fought their oppressors with any and every 
weapon they could lay hands on. 

In the turpentine-country, in a forest, Jimmie and his pal 
came to a "jungle' a place where the "wobblies" congregated, 
living off the country. Here around the camp-fires Jimmie met 
the guerrillas of the class-struggle, and learned the songs of 
revolt which they sang some of them parodies on Christian 
hymns which would have caused the orthodox and respectable 
to faint with horror. Here they rested up, and exchanged data 
on the progress of their fight, and argued over tactics, and 
cussed the Socialists and the other "politicians" and "labour- 
fakirs," and sang the praises of the "one big union' and the 
"mass strike' and "direct action" against the masters of indus- 
try. They told stories of their sufferings and their exploits, and 
Jimmie sat and listened. Sometimes his eyes were wide with 
consternation, for he had never met men so desperate as these. 

For example, "Strawberry" Curran named for his red hair 
and innumerable freckles an Irish boy with the face of a choir- 
singer, and eyes that must have been taken straight out of the 
blue vault of heaven. This lad told about a "free speech fight" 
in a far Western city, and how the chief of police had led the 
clubbing, and how they had got back at him. "We bumped 
him off all right," said "Strawberry" ; it was a favourite phrase 
of his whenever anybody got in his way, he "bumped him off." 
A.nd then "Flathead Joe," who came from the Indian country, 





was moved to emulation, and told how he had put dynamite 
under the supports of a mine-breaker, and the whole works had 
slid down a slope into a canyon a mile below. And then a 
lame fellow, "Chuck" Peterson, told about the imprisonment of 
two strike-leaders in the hop-country of California, and of the 
epidemic of fires and destructions that had plagued that region 
for several years since. 

All such things these men talked about quite casually, as 
soldiers would talk about the events of the last campaign. This 
class-war had been going on for ages, and had its own ethics 
and its own traditions; those who took part in it had their 
heroisms and sublimities, precisely like any other soldiers. They 
would have been glad to come into the open and fight, but 
the other side had all the guns. Every time the "wobblies" 
succeeded in organising the workers and calling a big strike, 
all the agencies of capitalist repression were called in they 
were beaten by capitalist policemen, shot by capitalist sheriffs, 
starved and frozen in capitalist jails, and so their strike was 
crushed and their forces scattered. After many such experi- 
ences, it was inevitable that the hot-headed ones should take to 
secret vengeance, should become conspirators against capitalist 
society. And society, forgetting all the provocations it had 
given, called the "wobblies" criminals, and let it go at that. 
But they were a strange kind of criminal, serving a far-off 
dream. They had their humours and their humanities, their 
literature and music and art. Among them were men of educa- 
tion, graduates of universities both in America and abroad; 
you might hear one of the group about these camp-fires telling 
about slave-revolts in ancient Egypt and Greece; or quoting 
Strindberg and Stirner, or reciting a scene from Synge, or nar- 
rating how he had astounded the family of some lonely farm- 
house by playing Eachmaninoff's "Prelude" on a badly out-of- 
tune piano. 

Also you met among them men who had kept their gentle- 
ness, their sweetness of soul; men of marvellous patience, whose 
dream of human brotherhood no persecution, no outrage had 
been able to turn sour. They clung to their vision of a world 
redeemed, made over by the outcast and lowly ; a vision that was 
brought to the world by a certain Jewish carpenter, and has 
haunted mankind for nineteen hundred years. The difference 
was that these men knew precisely how they meant to do it; they 



 

had a definite philosophy, a definite programme, which they car- 
ried as a gospel to the wage-slaves of the world. And they knew 
that this glad message would never die not all the jails and 
clubs and machine-guns in the country could kill it, not obloquy 
and ridicule, not hunger and cold and disease. No ! for the work- 
ers were hearing and understanding, they were learning the all- 
precious lesson of Solidarity. They were forming the "one big 
union' preparing the time when they would take over industry 
and administer it through their own workers' councils, instead 
of through the medium of parliaments and legislatures. That 
was the great idea upon which the Industrial Workers of the 
World was based ; it was this they meant by "direct action' not 
the sinister thing which the capitalist newspapers made out of 
the phrase. 



The country was going into its own war, which it considered 
of importance, and it called upon Jimmie Higgins and the rest 
of his associates to register for military service. In the month 
of June ten million men came forward in obedience to this 
call but Jimmie, needless to say, was not among them. Jim- 
mie and his crowd thought it was the greatest joke of the age. 
If the country wanted them, let it come and get them! And 
sure enough, the country came a sheriff and some thirty 
farmers and turpentine-workers sworn in as deputies and armed 
with shot-guns and rifles. Should their sons go over seas to 
be killed in battle, while these desperadoes continued to camp 
out on the country, living on hogs and chickens which honest 
men had worked to raise? They had wanted to break up this 
"jungle" for some time; now they could do it in the name of 
patriotism ! They surrounded the camp, and shot one man who 
tried to slip out in the darkness, and searched the rest for 
weapons, and then loaded them into half a dozen automobiles 
and took them to the nearest lockup. 

So here was Jimmie, confronting a village draft-board. 
How old was he? The truth was that Jimmie did not know 
definitely, but his guess was about twenty-six. The draft-limit 
being thirty, he swore that he was thirty-two. And what were 
they going to do about it? They didn't know where he had 
been born, and they couldn't make him tell because he didn't 
know it himself ! His face was lined with many cares, and he 





had a few grey hairs from that night of horror when his loved 
ones had been wiped out of existence. These farmers knew how 
to tell the age of a horse, but not how to tell the age of a man ! 

"We'll draft ye anyhow I" vowed the chairman of the board, 
who was the local justice of the peace, an old fellow with a beard 
like a billy-goat. 

"All right," said Jimmie, "but you'll get nothin' out o' me." 

"What d'ye mean?" 

"I mean I wouldn't fight; I'm a conscientious objector to 
war." 

"They'll shoot ye !" 

"Shoot away!" 

"They'll send you to jail for life." 

"What the hell do I care?" 

It was difficult to know what to do with a person like that. 
If they did put him in jail, they would only be feeding him at 
the expense of the community, and that would not help to beat 
the Germans. They could see from the flash in his eyes that 
he would not be an easy man to break. Local interest asserted 
itself, and the old fellow with the wagging beard demanded : "If 
we let ye go, will ye get out o' this county ?" 

"What the hell do I care about your old county?" replied 
Jimmie. 

So they turned him loose, and "Wild Bill" also, because it 
was evident at a glance that he was not long for this world 
and its wars. The two of them broke into an empty freight-car, 
and went thundering over the rails all night; and lying in the 
darkness, Jimmie was awakened by a terrified cry from his com- 
panion, and put out his hand and laid it in a mess that was hot 
and wet. 

"Oh, my God !" gasped Bill. "I'm done for !" 

"What is it?" 

"Hemorrhage." 

The terrified Jimmie did not even know what that was. 
There was nothing he could do but sit there, holding his friend's 
trembling hand and listening to his moans. When the train 
stopped, Jimmie sprang out and rushed to one of the brakemen, 
who came with his lantern, and saw "Wild Bill" lying in a pool 
of blood, already so far gone that he could not lift his head. 
" Jesus!" exclaimed the brakeman. "He's a goner, all right." 
The "goner" was trying to say something, and Jimmie leaned 




his ear down to him. "Good-bye, old pal," whispered Bill. 
That was all, but it caused Jimmie to burst out sobbing. 

The engine whistled. "What the hell you stiffs doin' on this 
train?" demanded the brakeman but not so harshly as the 
words would indicate. He lifted the dying man no very seri- 
ous burden and laid him on the platform of the station. 
"Sorry' he said, "but we're behind schedule." He waved his 
lantern, and the creaking cars began to move, and the train 
drew away, leaving Jimmie sitting by the corpse of his pal. 
The world seemed a lonely place that long night. 

In the morning the station-agent came, and notified the 
nearest authorities, and in the course of the day came a wagon 
to fetch the body. What was the use of Jimmie's waiting? 
One "Potter's field" was the same as another, and there would 
be nothing inspiring about the funeral. The man who drove 
the wagon looked at Jimmie suspiciously and asked his age; 
they were scarce of labour in that country, he said the rule 
was "Work or fight." Jimmie foresaw another session with 
a draft-board, so he leaped onto another freight train, taking 
with him as a legacy "Wild Bill's" diary of the unemployed 
army.

It was harvest-time, and Jimmie went West to the wheat 
country. It was hard work, but the pay made your eyes bulge. 
Jimmie realised that war was not such a bad thing for the 
ones that stayed at home ! If you didn't like one farmer's way 
of speaking to you, or the kind of biscuits his wife offered you, 
you could move on to the next, and he would take you in at 
four bits more per day. It was the nearest approach to a work- 
ingman's paradise that Jimmie had ever encountered. There 
was really only one drawback the pestiferous draft-boards 
that never stopped snooping round. They were forever hauling 
you up and threatening and questioning you putting you 
through the same scene over and over. Why couldn't the boobs 
give you a card, showing that you had been through the mill, 
and let that settle it? But no, they wouldn't give you a 
card they preferred to go on jacking you up because you had 
no card I It was all a trick, thought Jimmie, to wear him out 
and force him into their army by hook or by crook. But here 
was one time when they would not get away with it! 




However, Jimmie Higgins was not nearly so dangerous a 
character, now that "Wild Bill" was gone out of his life. It 
was really not his nature to cherish hate, or to set out deliber- 
ately to revenge himself. Jimmie was a Socialist in the true 
sense of the word he felt himself a part of society, and that 
peace and plenty and kindness which he desired for himself he 
desired for all mankind. He was not dreaming of a time when 
he could turn the capitalists out of power and treat them as they 
were now treating him; he meant the world to be just as good 
a place for the capitalists as for the workers all would share 
alike, and Jimmie was ready to wipe out the old scores and 
start fair any day. His propaganda regained its former ideal- 
istic hue, and it was only when somebody tried to drag him into 
the slaughter-pen that he developed teeth and claws.
