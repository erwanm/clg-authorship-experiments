laughed Helen. "And she is really very fond ol 




study. We shall both try to graduate next year." 

"I am glad of that," was the reply. 

Mrs. Aldred was much entertained studying 
her girls again and watching the improvement 
some of them had made. And she saw that Daisy 
Bell was quite indifferent to Helen. 

"Have you and Daisy outgrown your friend- 
ship ?" she asked with a soft smile that was sym- 
pathetic rather than curious. "Or is it simply 
a case of a young woman and a girl!" 

Helen flushed scarlet. "I think we have," she 
answered slowly. "You see I was away and the 
class went ahead of me. And I am only a girl 
as yet. I do not want to be a woman." 

There was something back of this, but Mrs. 
Aldred was not one to force a confidence. 

"Such endings frequently occur," she said 
gravely. "We outgrow many things in this life 
and get fitted for others. That is true develop- 
ment. Some few people remain stationary, but 
they are generally unimportant characters, or else 
living in circumscribed environments. Even they 
may not be altogether to blame." 

Helen thought of the narrowness and com- 
placency of many of the people of Hope. And 
she was glad it was given to her to outgrow 
their manner of thinking. How Aunt Jane prided 





herself on the old routine of living and doing, 
and nagged at Nat for bringing in new methods. 
There were others who never broadened out, 
never looked beyond the boundaries of their own 
little town. Was that true content? And was 
content so admirable? 



CHAPTER II 



AN ADVENTURE 



Oddly enough Helen was thinking of Daisy 
Bell as she went out into the hall. The light, 
graceful step came down the stairway with a sort 
of dazzle. There was always a flying curl, an 
end of ribbon or the gauzy rosette somewhere 
that seemed to make an ellipse. 

She nodded carelessly as she passed Helen. 
Probably the old anger was gone, and she did 
not care. Yet the outgrowing gave her a pang. 
If Daisy had not been so positive, so insistent 
in her protestations — but in a year one could 
change greatly. Daisy was charming a little cir- 
cle with the same fervor with which she had ap- 
pealed to her. Was it insincerity? 

The deepest pang would be giving up Mr. and 
Mrs. Bell and the ideal home life that had so 
penetrated the desires of her heart, and the wise, 
judicious friend she had hoped to keep. Mrs. 
Wilmarth adored her too much to be a serviceable 
mentor. Mrs. Dayton with all her tender gen- 
erosity would prefer that she had chosen the 


 

narrower life. With Juliet Craven she was the 
leading spirit. One could rely upon Mrs. Aldred, 
and yet, you could only be one of many. 

That was selfish, too. But a motherless girl 
might be forgiven for the longing. 

Examinations began. As usual several girls 
had prepared for college. Others were being 
pushed up. Juliet did finely. Helen was hardly 
up to the mark in all studies but she knew that 
she could make it up in vacation. 

The little Gartney children had come to be 
quite at home, and now were full of sorrow at 
parting with Miss Craven. They were to go to 
an aunt's in the country, as their father and new 
mother were to take a tour westward, and the 
aunt they scarcely knew. 

"If I had a house of my own I should beg for 
them. They will have lonely lives for the next 
few years. Still they have each other. And they 
are coming back, their father wrote." 

There was to be the usual commencement. Or, 
rather, it was to be a little unusual, quite the 
affair of the season. This compliment was due to 
the kindly neighbors who had so warmly wel- 
comed her back, Mrs. Aldred thought, and sev- 
eral of the parents from a distance had expressed 
a desire to be present. 



 

"My father and mother want to come," Daisy 
was explaining to a circle of her admirers. "I 
really did not imagine they were so proud of 
me. And my sister also. Then we are going to 
spend the night in New York, and the next day 
Columbia College Commencement takes place and 
my brother has one of the orations. Why, I think 
papa ought really to be proud of us !" 

"As if he wasn't," declared a chorus of en- 
thusiastic voices. "But we shall miss you so." 

"The light of Aldred House will be gone." 

Daisy turned and made a pretty, sweeping 
courtesy, the seductive gleam of pleasure in her 
eyes. 

"Is it the penny dip?" with a bright rippling 
laugh. 

"Well you needn't despise the little candle. 
Think of the honor Shakespeare paid it." 

"But you are all going, too," returned Daisy. 
"Seven — a famous number." 

"And five collegiates." 

"And two butterflies, Sophie Durand and my- 
self. Well — we shall flit from flower to flower. 
I mean to have a splendid time." 

"And break hearts by the dozens." 

"Well, hearts should not be so brittle," sub- 
joined Daisy with a dainty toss of the head. "I 



 

do not believe they break so easily. I notice 
that they soon console themselves with another." 

"Oh, Daisy, you must not turn cynical. It will 
not suit your style." 

"I should be very true to a true friend," Daisy 
said with emphasis. "But I shouldn't wait for a 
friend to throw me over when I found she or 
even he," with a laugh, "was loving some one 
better. I'm not inclined to play second fiddle." 

"You will not need to," said one of the girls. 
"I should like to have your gift of attraction." 

"Really, I am proud to have a quality some 
one desires," and as she gave her head a little toss 
the wavy hair made a golden glitter. 

"I was thinking of something, a plan I will 
propose," exclaimed May Bradshaw, rather tired 
of the personal talk. She was a tall, fine-looking 
girl with a resolute face. After two years of so- 
ciety she had come back for a post-graduate 
course and was going to college. 

The eager faces were turned to her at once. 

"Let us have one last row upon the river." 

" 'Do you recall that night in June 
Upon the Danube river?'" 

hummed another. "With all my heart, only let 
us take it late in the afternoon, as we have 



 

no cavaliers to rescue us in case of danger." 

"I have been thinking it would be delightful 
to go up to Rip's Point and gather branches of 
rhododendrons. We can keep them until Thurs- 
day." 

"That's just splendid. We will have them to 
adorn the house on the grand occasion. And 
why can't we go this afternoon? Let us plead 
for an early dinner, and the sun will be almost 
down so we shall not get burned to shame our 
white gowns. Four rowers and four guests. 
Perhaps the rowers had better offer their services, 
or shall we vote them in?" 

"Fll offer mine," exclaimed May Bradshaw. 
"You may hear of me in the distant future as 
the champion oarswoman." 

There were two other proffers, and then one 
was voted in even if it was not parliamentary. 

"And I shall invite Daisy Bell as my guest be- 
cause she never fidgets or rocks the boat. And 
she can sing that dear old Blue Danube." 

"The guests must be the musical part of the 
crew," insisted some one. 

Two or three longing eyes were cast at Juliet 
Craven, but it was well known that Daisy Bell 
did not admire her, so the lot fell upon some one 
else. Mrs. Wiley consented on condition that 



 

they should not stay out late, and ordered the 
dinner at once. The girls hunted up baskets in 
which to stow away their trophies, and the four 
rowers donned their yachting attire, looking 
pretty enough for a much more important occa- 
sion. Then they marched down to the landing 
where they found their boat in readiness. 

The river was a pretty, irregular stream, now 
narrowing, now widening out. Occasionally a 
small sloop found its way up, but the stream was 
not certain enough in its current to attract busi- 
ness. Up above Westchester it broadened out 
into a sort of lake, fed by two small streams that 
in spring freshets rendered it rather turbulent. 
The country on the opposite shore was very pic- 
turesque. Here was a bluff of gray rock overhung 
with vines, and there were odd little nooks sug- 
gesting dryad haunts, then a belt of trees largely 
fir, spruce and hemlock that added a continual 
greenness to the landscape. Now everything 
was in the glory of early summer and countless 
wild flowers lent their beauty to the scene. 

The sun dropped down behind the hills and 
sent long beautiful shadows in all kinds of 
opalescent tints. Back of the trees it was a flam- 
ing gorgeous red like a great fire that shone 
through the interstices. Up in the arch of the 




horizon there was a mingling of all colors, drown- 
ing out the blue. The birds were calling each 
other home and the wood thrush poured forth his 
melodious evening song. 

"I am glad I am not an artist," exclaimed 
one of the girls. "If I were, a picture like this 
would be my despair and drive me crazy. And 
now I can enjoy it to the farthest recesses of 
my brain without a thought of brush or pal- 
ette." 

"And how few people give thanks for the great 
gallery of nature where you are admitted without 
money or a complimentary ticket." 

"Yet occasionally we do pay our way, for in- 
stance the price of the boat," was the sententious 
reply. 

"You unsentimental girl I" 

"But what is sentiment compared to truth?" 

"Wasn't it Charles Lamb who said Truth is 
too precious to be wasted upon everybody ?' " 

They dropped into merriment, flinging jests 
and quotations at one another, breaking into 
snatches of gay song, calling attention to some 
unusual bit of picturesque beauty. Now the sun 
dropped entirely behind the hill, leaving their own 
side in an exquisite golden glow, while in the 
shade there was an indefinable richness of dark 



 

green verging to twilight suggestiveness. Fire- 
flies came out. A whippoorwill called to its mate 
in a long, melancholy note. 

For several miles they went up triumphantly, 
though the tide was nearly on the change. 

There the river took a little bend and for some 
distance there was a rocky, shelving shore. And 
here, quite a long point, when the hills began 
again. They fastened their boat and took a 
winding way up the wooded bank. Here rho- 
dodendrons and laurel grew in the wildest pro- 
fusion and were a sight in blossom time, seldom 
indeed molested. Pink, white and the deeper 
red, just opening, great bud spikes that would be 
sure to unfold in water. 

"It seems a shame that all this should be *born 
to blush unseen,' " quoted one of the girls. 

"I like to think there are some things in the 
world that are not despoiled by the ruthless 
hand of fashion, for oftentimes it is that," re- 
turned May Bradshaw. "This looks just the 
same as it did four or five years ago, and I shall 
think of it a great many times. Nature is so 
generous when you let her alone and does bring 
her work to perfection when she has a chance." 

"What shall we do for wild places when all the 
earth is occupied?" 

They fastened their boat and took a winding way up the 
wooded bank.


"Oh, we will be in some other country per- 
haps exploring the planets that are such realms 
of mystery to us now, glad that there was a little 
knowledge left." 

They filled their baskets and loaded their arms 
and retraced their steps, packing away their 
treasures and taking last surveys of a really beau- 
tiful spot, loth to leave it. The sky was melting 
to a dusky white with soft gray at the edges, 
where presently the blue would appear with the 
trailing stars. 

The tide was turning lazily now, and they 
rowed slowly, singing songs, dropping insensibly 
into the plaintive ones. For at heart, hopeful as 
they were of the coming years, anxious to try 
their strength and win something from the world, 
there was a tender undercurrent of days that 
would never come again, of the 

"Something sweet. 
That follows youth with flying feet." 

"There is a black cloud in the northeast," cried 
Gertrude Rand. "What if a shower should catch 
us?" 

"That isn't the place for a shower. And it 
is going to pieces," was the confident reply. 

The day had been very warm. Now the wind 



 

suddenly veered northward and came in great 
sweeps, shaking the shrubbery and bending the 
more pliant branches of the trees with the mys- 
terious moaning of nightfall. 

"Lucky for us it comes from the north/* said 
May. "The wind and tide are in our favor. And 
the south is full of stars." 

"It is going to be cooler," declared Grace 
Deane. "And that will be a blessing. I have 
baked for the last three days." 

A strong gust came more from the eastward 
and almost drove them into the shore which was 
very sloping here. 

"Oh, we must not get aground." 

When it subsided they rowed a little farther 
out and for some moments went on beautifully. 
Then there came another gust of wind that 
almost whirled them around, and sent the boat 
along sharply. 

"Oh, May, the rift !" cried a voice in affright. 

The wind came off conqueror. They were 
forced swiftly into something as if the passage 
between Scylla and Charybdis had opened, and 
though it gave them a shock and snapped one 
oar they soon righted. Having done that, the 
bursting cloud sent the blue black drifts and 



 

tatters over the sky and subsided, though the 
tumult on the river lingered. 

"Now we must try to back out since we can- 
not go forward," said May. "A good strong 
push, girls." 

They all tried, paused and rested, and tried 
again, yet they* were not simply aground but 
wedged in a sort of gorge that held them 
prisoners. 

"Oh, what shall we do ?" in a chorus of anxious 
tones. "How can we get out?" 

"We are safe at least, and there is no danger 
of a shower. See how blue it is in the north, 
almost like a winter night." 

"If someone would come along !" 

They all shouted in unison and a thousand 
echoes were the only answer. Again and again 
they shouted until the woods rang, but with no 
result. 

"We cannot stay here all night, though I think 
there would be a rescue party. Til tell you what 
I am going to do. Do you see that light glim- 
mering through the little opening? Fm sure it 
is a house. I'm going to wade to the shore and 
run up there." 

May Bradshaw stood up in her young strength, 
her voice inspiring. 



 

"Oh, you don't know how deep the water is." 

"ril take an oar to measure. Don't be afraid." 

"But you'll get awful wet." 

"ril pin up my skirts and not mind the rest" 

She stepped out bravely with the oar for an 
alpenstock, and threaded her way safely, giving a 
cheer as she reached the shore. 'Then she picked 
her way up to the cottage light, where a large 
family were seated round the tea table. A woman 
stood at the head, dishing out a savory stew. 

Miss Bradshaw told her plight without any 
circumlocution. Could they get another boat to 
take them home? 

"Well now," exclaimed the biggest boy, "we 
ain't got no boat. They've one over to Bee- 
croft's." 

"Where is that?" 

"A spell up the river. If you'll wait until I 
get my supper, I'll go along, I'm powerful hun- 
gry." 

"I've heerd that this ten or twelve year," com- 
mented the woman with a grim but not unkindly 
smile. 

Powerfully hungry he seemed to be. The 
woman insisted that Miss Bradshaw should have 
a cup of tea and a chunk of 'lasses cake, but she 
would accept only a glass of milk. It was rather 


funny to hear the children's good natured wran- 
gle. At last Jack was ready to start. 

It was a rough road and a very long "spell," 
Miss Bradshaw thought, and here they had just 
finished supper. There was Mr. Beecroft and 
his wife, Tim, eighteen or so, and two girls. Miss 
Bradshaw repeated her story. 

"Well, if that don't beat all!" exclaimed the 
senior. "Last week we thought we'd blast the 
pesky thing out, it's bothered for years. We 
did kick up a bobbery but we hadn't enough dyna- 
mite. We split the thing consid'able, an' I s'pose 
you jest druv in it slick as grease ! It's funny 
enough to laugh about," and he did that to per- 
fection. "We're goin' to take the hull p'int 
out when we get some more dynamite. Tim, 
you get out the boat and go an' help the gals 
outen the scrape. 'Pears like we helped to get 
'em in it. An' you take the lantern, too." 

"There are eight of us," said Miss Bradshaw. 

"Well I declare !" ejaculated Mr. Beecroft. 

"You had better get the Ketchems' boat," said 
one of the girls. "Ours leaks, you know." 

"Well— I think I had," nodding his head re- 
flectively. "I'll get it and row down. Jack, you 
see that the lady don't go astray in the woods." 

Miss Bradshaw expressed her gratitude and 



 

the party started out, Tim with tremendous 
strides. It was quite dark under the trees, but 
the moon made a silvery radiance on the river 
as here and there they caught glimpses of it. But 
she was in no mood to enjoy the serene beauty of 
the night and she hardly listened to Jack, who 
felt well enough acquainted to be loquacious. 
Were the girls worried? Did it seem long to 
them? 

They watched the stars come out, and aired 
their astronomy, speculating on the worlds so 
hidden from mortal ken. It was growing colder, 
so they drew their dress skirts up over their 
shoulders, and talked over the test questions and 
hopes for next year, for now they had no heart 
for merriment. The boat did not move, so they 
were secure enough. 

They saw a light coming down the river pres- 
ently. But where was May? 

A strong voice gave a shout and their courage 
revived, as they sent back a cheer. 

"She has found a boat. All's well that ends 
well," was the cheerful exclamation. 

It came swiftly down to them, its beacon light 
shining and showing up the young oarsman who 
called out: 

"Hello ! Be you the crowd fast in the rift?" 



 

They answered. But where was May? And 
had he come by pure providential accident? 

"Is there any such thing?" queried one of the 
girls. 

Tim made his explanations. Then he gave 
a shout that made the woods ring. It was soon 
answered. 

"Jack and the lady ain't far off. You see you 
would have been safe even in a shower. But 
it's rather funny that you should have been druv 
jest in here. I don't s'pose you could have done 
it on a try !" 

"The gust of wind did it. Rude Boreas sure 
enough." 

There tvas another call through the woods. 
Then the sound of voices and the rustling of 
shrubbery and the two figures emerged in the 
moonlight. 

"Oh, Mayl" exclaimed the girls in a breath. 

"Did you get tired waiting? But I found 
some one at last. It's rather lonely up here and 
not thickly settled," with a laugh. 

Tim and Jack did a little sparring at first. Then 
the elder said to the girls : 

"I'll hold my boat stiddy up to your stern and 
you step over keerful, jest one at a time, though 
you'd only get a ducking if you tumbled, you 



 

wouldn't drown. We'll see 'bout your boat to- 
morrow. Danged if I b'Heve she'll run away. 
How many of you gals can row ?" 

"Six of us." 

"Then we won't need Jack, and the boat will 
be full enough without him." 

They were taken off without any misadventure. 
Even the flowers followed suit. Miss Bradshaw 
expressed her warmest thanks to Jack, who said 
in country awkwardness — " 'Twas jest nothin' at 
all, only I don't b'lieve you could have found your 
way alone." 

Although they were cold, their spirits rose as 
they went spinning down the stream. Then 
they caught sight of another light and were 
greeted with a signal cry. 

In truth, as time passed the two ladies at the 
school began to feel very anxious, especially when 
the shower threatened. The younger girls had 
retired, the elder ones were gathered about Mrs. 
Aldred, never wearying of hearing the interesting 
episodes of her journey. Yet Helen Grant's 
thoughts strayed off now and then to the grace- 
ful, dainty figure that had stood in the hall an- 
nouncing her plans and pleasures with such a 
triumphant air. Only a few days more and they 
would give each other a careless good-bye and 


the old difference would never be made up. But 
then, other girls had gone their way, other youth- 
ful friendships had been sundered. Still she did 
regret that she must go out of the life of Mr. 
and Mrs. Bell. 

Presently there was a note of alarm. "I think 
we had better walk down to the dock," Mrs. 
Aldred said. "And it might be wisdom to send 
a boat up to meet them." 

Several of the older girls begged to go, so 
quite a party set out. No alarm was felt, as the 
girls had been up the river many a time and 
there really was no chance of an accident; they 
had gone farther than they meant, or spent more 
time gathering flowers, and the little squall 
had been only momentary. But down in the 
south there were some suspicious looking clouds 
and the wind was hovering about the east. 

However a boat went out with two men. But 
it needed not to go very far and then there was 
a cheerful shout floating down to them that told 
everybody was safe. 

"It was quite romantic," declared Miss Brad- 
shaw, with the brightest laugh she could sum- 
mon, for she was really cold and tired. "We ran 
into a rift and were wedged fast. There wasn't 
a bit of danger, but we had to hunt up someone 



 

to come to the rescue, which Mr. Beecroft did 
gallantly, and so, like the old woman with her 
misadventures, we were enabled to get home that 
very same night. Your thanks are due to him." 

He was explaining how they had failed to 
blow the rift out of the river and left it in a 
rather dangerous condition. Half a dozen vol- 
unteered to go up the next day and settle the 
matter after rescuing the boat. 

They hurried homeward, and though there had 
been no real danger there was a feeling of grati- 
tude in every heart. There were hot baths and 
ginger tea and everybody was safe in bed about 
midnight. 

"Though I think we shall get the shower after 
all," said Mrs. Aldred. "It is growing quite close 
and warm again, and the south looks suspicious. 
It would be an improvement to have a little cooler 
weather." 



CHAPTER III 

WAS IT A WISH FULFILLED? 

While the stars were still out in the north 
there were vivid flashes of lightning and purple 
black clouds seemed to rush up from the south 
while the northerly gust tore them in tatters, 
veering this way and that. Suddenly a glow 
seemed to set the world on fire, and a tremendous 
peal of thunder crashed everywhere and rolled 
off to the gulf of Mexico, followed by a sharp 
dash of rain. 

Just after the peal there was a wild cry of 
terror and when Miss Wiley opened her door to 
listen she saw a white figure running to and fro 
talking and sobbing. 

"Oh, Miss Daisy, what is it? You are safe, 
dear," and she clasped her in her arms. 

But the girl was confused and past reasoning, 
her eyes distraught, her whole frame shaking as 
with an ague. Mrs. Aldred joined her and they 
tried to tranquilize Daisy, but in vain. She talked 
of some awful danger and held tightly to the 
friendly arm. 




 

Miss Wiley glanced into her room and made a 
light. "There is nothing amiss," she explained, 
"but the peal of thunder was terrific." 

The girls came out in affright to see what had 
happened. Mrs. Aldred entreated them to re- 
turn to their rooms, and begged Miss Wiley to 
take Daisy to hers while she prepared a com- 
posing draught, and called up the nurse. There 
was no real danger, and in all probability Miss 
Bell had been roused from her first sleep and was 
hysterical. 

"Of course their adventure was trying to the 
nerves and I noticed that Miss Daisy looked 
utterly exhausted. But if we can get her to sleep 
again I think she will be all right." 

Mary came and tried her soothing powers but 
Daisy appeared possessed by some wild idea of 
flight She swallowed the draught, but it did not 
seem to calm her. 

"Oh, I do hope it will not be serious ! She was 
counting so on Commencement, and has passed 
so successfully." 

The rain had nearly ceased, though there were 
some distant mutterings of thunder. 

"I want Helen Grant," Daisy exclaimed sud- 
denly, making another attempt to leave her bed. 
"I must go to her. There is something — " 



 

"Helen will come here," and Mrs. Aldred nod- 
ded to Mary to summon her. 

The girls had hardly subsided from the dis- 
turbance. Helen answered at once, and slipping 
on a wrapper went to the room in a curious state 
of trepidation. Daisy was tossing about with 
half-closed eyes and flushed face, her golden hair 
like a cloud about her. 

"Speak to her," said nurse Mary, '*She seems 
hardly conscious." 

To come this way. To speak some words of 
soothing and comfort and perhaps be repulsed ! 

"Daisy;" — the voice was low and clear. 
"Daisy," and she took one hand in hers, that 
were steady if her nerves were not. "I am here 
and the storm is all over. Nothing shall harm 
you." 

Daisy quieted a moment, then she burst out 
again wanderingly. She was in the boat and 
begged to be saved. "I must see Helen," she cried. 

"Talk to her — anything to calm her until the 
sedative takes effect." 

Oh, what should she say? She longed to 
take her in the arms that had enfolded her many 
a time, but she was afraid of rousing some an- 
tagonism. Then like an inspiration a poem of 
Whittier's came to her, one they had both been 



 

fond of. In a slow, clear voice she began though 
she had to make an effort. The lines were so 
regular, so full of faith and love and like swells 
of music. Daisy seemed to listen though she 
still sobbed a little and tossed about, but the mo- 
tions lost their violence, and a sort of languor 
crept over her. Helen came to the last verse — 

"I know not where the islands lift 
Their fronded palms in air; 
I only know I cannot drift 

Beyond His love and care.** 

Daisy opened her eyes wide and glanced at 
Helen, then they drooped slowly, and she gave a 
long, quivering breath and was quiet. 

"I think she will sleep now. The draught and 
your voice. Miss Grant, have conquered" and the 
nurse smiled. 

"You seemed to know the best thing to do," 
said Mrs. Aldred. "I hope you will get a little 
sleep yourself as a reward for your kindly service. 
We all thank you." 

"I am glad I could do it," and with one 
look at Daisy, Helen slipped quietly from the 
room. 

She explained in a low tone that it had not 
been anything worse than a severe nervous fright 
If it had not been a breach of the rules she felt 




indisposed to talk even to Juliet. Did a lost love 
ever truly come back, she wondered. 

The girls were bright enough the next morn- 
ing and disposed to look at the amusing side of 
the adventure. Miss Bradshaw recounted her 
search for a man and a boat with the utmost 
spirit. They had saved their rhododendrons, and 
fortunately missed the brief shower. The morn- 
ing was splendidly clear and somewhat cooler. 

Mrs. Aldred announced that Miss Bell had 
no fever and only felt languid, but that she had 
advised her to remain in bed most of the day, 
and as she wished her kept quiet, she hoped the 
girls would refrain from calling on her. 

There was shopping for trifles and mementos, 
calls of farewell to make on some of the resi- 
dents, and still a little reviewing for a few of the 
last examinations. 

Late in the afternoon Helen sat on the porch 
telling some of the younger division the story of 
the Golden Fleece. Miss Craven had gone down- 
town with the Gartney twins. 

Mary came and paused in the doorway wait- 
ing for the story to be finished. Then coming for-
