"I may not return before Christmas. I hear that the holidays are
celebrated with much style and festivity, in the country," she replied.

Mr. Read suppressed something very like an oath, at her calm assurance.

"When do you go?"

"Next Monday. Dr. Carleton is expected daily. Did I understand you to
say, that you did not object?"

"Confound it! what do I care where, or when you go?"

"Oh Carry!" apostrophized Ida, shutting herself in her room. "Even you
could not be charitable and forbearing here. It is hard! hard!"

"That is unquestionably the most wrong-headed girl I know," said Mr.
Read, to his daughter.

"I am heartily glad she is not going with us," was the answer. "She
would be of no use to me, and an additional care to you."

"Maybe so, maybe not. Her travelling expenses would not have come
out of my pocket; and there are advantages, sometimes, in having two
ladies, a larger and better room, and such like; you pay the same
price, and have twice the value of your money. You understand?"

"I don't care. I had rather sleep upon a pallet in a loft, by myself,
than in the handsomest room in the house, with her for a room-mate. It
frets me, though to see her airs! I wish the law allowed you absolute
control."

"It won't do with her. If she suspected a design on my part to abridge
her liberties, or defraud her of her dues, she would as lief enter a
complaint against me as not. She has the temper of the Evil One; and
watch as you may, will get the bit between her teeth."

The carriage was at the door by six o'clock on Monday morning. Ida was
ready; but her trunk was strapped on, and her maid seated upon the
box with the driver, before she appeared. The truth was, she dreaded
to meet Dr. Carleton. She did not recollect her own father, and had
no agreeable associations connected with any who bore that relation
to her young acquaintances. She was inclined to look upon the class,
as a set of necessary discords in life; Mr. Read being the key-note.
Carry often spoke of her surviving parent with earnest affection; but
Ida attributed this to a charity, that beheld no faults in those she
loved. The thought of her ride and visit would have been unalloyed,
but for this idiosyncrasy. "If he were like Mr. Dana!" she said, going
slowly down stairs. He was in the porch, with Mr. Read and Carry. "My
friend Ida, father," said Carry. He was not like Mr. Dana,--better
than that! He was the image of Carry--her eyes, mouth and smile--his
locks, although silvered by years, must in youth have waved in the
same golden curls. He was handsome yet, how could he be otherwise! and
had she failed to love him at sight, the unaffected geniality of his
salutation would have captivated her. She had not a care in the world,
as she reclined in the carriage, beside Carry, the revolving wheels
bearing her towards the country. Mr. Read and his feminine prototype
were sign-posts, marking rough and miry roads she had travelled; they
were troubles no more; she was leaving them behind.

There had been a thunder-storm in the night, and in that brief fit
of passion, nature had wept away every unkind or unpleasant emotion.
The sky wore that rich, soft, transparent hue, which imparts its own
pureness to the soul of him, who looks upon it; smilingly luring it
to soar away, and "steep itself in the blue of its remembered home;"
the forest-leaves glittered with rain-diamonds, and the bird-matin was
warbled by a full orchestra. And on, through the slants of sunlight,
and the alternations of deep, green shade; with the old, familiar
chirpings in her ear, and the touch of the loved one's hand upon hers,
rode the orphan; very quiet, through excess of happiness; afraid to
speak or move, lest this should prove a never-to-be realized dream,
whose awaking should bring bitter, hopeless yearnings!

Little by little, Carry broke up her musings; and her father seconded
her. He was prepared to like his daughter's friend, and there was that
in his eye and voice, which made Ida forget, as she had done with
Carry,--that she was talking with a stranger.

"That is a fine specimen of your favorite tree, Ida," observed Carry,
pointing to a majestic pine, grand and solitary, at the entrance of a
grove of oaks.

"And superb it is, in its loneliness!" said Ida.

"Farmers would cavil at your taste," remarked Dr. Carleton. "'Pine
barrens' are proverbial. A thick growth of them is an unmistakeable
sign of poverty of soil. Nothing else can extract sustenance from the
worn out ground."

"That is why I like them, sir. There is sublimity in their hardy
independence, taking root, as you say, where pampered, or less robust
vegetation would perish, and with never-furling banners, stretching up
boldly towards the stars."

"They are emblems to you--of what?" asked the Doctor.

"Of the few really great ones, who have demonstrated that human nature
is not of necessity, vile or imbecile, or yet a debtor to accident, for
its spice of good."

"The gifted,--or the fortunate?"

"The resolute,--sir. They, who have riven the shackles of low
birth or poverty, and made for themselves a glorious name--out of
nothing!--have done it by the naked force of will. Call it 'talent'
or 'genius,' if you choose;--upon analyzation, you will resolve it into
this one element of character."

"It is a sorry task to pick flaws in your beautiful analogy," said
the old gentleman. "You may not be aware that your pine, sturdy as it
appears, is less fitted than any other tree, for standing alone; its
roots running out laterally from the trunk; and lying near the surface
of the earth. Cut down the outer row which have kept off the tempests,
and helped to support him, and the first hard wind is apt to lay him
low."

"And so there are fates, against which the mightiest of mortal energies
are powerless. Leave the pine unprotected, and if it survive one
blast, it strikes its roots deeper and deeper into the ground, until
it has strength to brave an hundred winters. Adversity, if it does not
kill--strengthens."

"Do you favor the philosophy, which teaches that a certain amount of
trouble is necessary for the complete development of character?"

"Whether necessary or not--it comes. That is not a matter of
hypothesis; but I have seen some, who, I did not think, required
discipline; and many more, who wanted softening, instead of hardening."

"Is hardening the legitimate effect of sorrow?" asked he, more gravely.
"When the chastening is guided by love, does it not melt and refine?
Are strength and hardness synonymous?"

"I question the difference, sir,--as the world goes."

"Instead of referring to 'the world,' in an abstract sense--judge we of
the influence of trials, by what we know of ourselves. I never tasted
real happiness, until I learned to bear grief, by submitting to the
will of Providence."

"And one affliction has embittered life for me!" returned Ida, gloomily.

"Poor child!" then recollecting himself, he addressed Carry in a
jesting tone. "And you--Miss Carry--what is your vote upon this
important question?"

"I have had no trouble, sir," replied she, lightly, "except
school-quarrels. You would not class them in the category of
tribulations."

There was sadness in her father's look of love, as he answered, "I hope
you may long be able to say so, dear!"

Carry brushed away the mist from her lashes. "'A consummation devoutly
to be desired,'--as Charley, or Shakspeare would say. Where is he,
father?"

"Who? Shakspeare or Charley?"

"The latter, of course. Apart from his probable location being more
easily decided upon,--he is, to me, the more interesting of the two."

"He is somewhere in the Western part of the State;--travelling, partly
for pleasure. John told you, that they have committed the New York
branch of the business to Mr. E----, and that Charley will in future
reside in Richmond."

"Yes, sir. I was glad to hear it; I understood, however, that this
change would not be made before Fall. In the interim, are not we to be
favoured with his company?"

"I trust so. It will seem like old times for us all to be together
again."

"I hope he will come while you are with us, Ida," said Carry. "I am so
anxious you should know him!"

"You have seen him, surely, Miss Ida?" said Dr. Carleton.

"I have not yet had that pleasure, sir."

"He is an original worth studying."

"I can credit that. Elle's panegyrics would have created a desire to
see this nonpareil of an 'Uncle Charley,' and Carry has raised my
curiosity to the highest pitch, by naming him as the successful rival
of Shakspeare."

"Oh!" cried Carry, laughing. "I said more interesting to me.
Charley is one of my pets; and I am afraid I have presented you with
an erroneously flattered picture of him. You must not look for an
'Admirable Crichton.' He is not one to please the fancy on a slight
acquaintance."

"Is he as handsome as his brother?"

"Which brother?" inquired the Doctor; and Carry blushed.

"I have met but one," said Ida. "I consider Mr. John Dana very
fine-looking."

"I will repeat Charley's ideas of what he styles, his 'personal
pulchritude,'" responded Carry. "He says he thanks Heaven he is not
handsome. To endow him with a moderate share of beauty, some one would
have been deprived of his, or her good looks. No broken hearts are laid
at the door of his conscience." 'Yes'--concluded he, triumphantly--'A
man ought to be grateful for ugliness; and I am persuaded that not many
have as much cause to rejoice on that score as myself!'"

"He is not homely," said her father, warmly.

"Ah father! other people tell a different story."

"That may be; but where you find one handsomer face than his, you see a
thousand destitute of its intelligence and agreeableness."

"Granted. Homely or not, I prefer him to any doll-faced dandy of my
acquaintance."

"He is fortunate in his advocates," said Ida. "He has the art of making
friends."

"Because he is such a firm friend himself," replied Carry. "Yet some
will have it that he is frivolous and unfeeling. The only satirical
remark I was ever guilty of, was extorted by an aspersion of this kind.
A lady was offended by a playful bagatelle of his; and thinking that
I would be a sure medium of communicating her wrath to its object,
criticised him unsparingly. She ridiculed his person and manners;--I
said nothing. She said he was bankrupt in chivalry and politeness.
I smiled; and she blazed out a philippic against his 'disgusting
levity and nonsense--he had not a spark of feeling, or grain of
sense--intelligent indeed! for her part she had never heard him say a
smart or sensible thing yet.'--I put in my oar here--'You will then
allow him one talent, at least; the ability to adapt his conversation
to the company he is in.' I repented having said it; but it quieted
her."

"You did not reproach yourself for taking the part of your friend!"

"No, but I might have done it in a less objectionable manner. It did
not alter her feelings to him, and caused her to dislike me."

"How is it, sir, that I hear so much more of this one of your former
wards, than of his younger brother?" said Ida to the Doctor.

The question was innocently propounded, and for an instant, she was
puzzled by the quizzical demureness, with which he glanced at his
daughter.

"This is a serious charge, Carry. Your predilection for one old
play-fellow should not make you forgetful of another."

She was looking down, touching the shining tire of the wheel with
the tip of her gloved finger. The truth beamed upon Ida; and with it
a thousand little circumstances she had been blindly stupid not to
understand before. Her intelligent eye said the mystery was explained,
but she forbore to say so in words. Dr. Carleton went on in a changed
tone.

"Arthur is not a whit behind his brothers in sterling worth, or
personal graces. He is associated with me in the practice of medicine,
and unites a skill and prudence, rarely found in one so young. He is
popular, and deservedly so."

Carry bestowed a grateful smile upon him, and was answered in the same
mute language. In such desultory chat, the sunny hours ran out They
travelled well; only stopping an hour to dine and rest; yet twilight
saw them eight miles from their destination. Each was disposed to
silence, as the light grew dimmer; and when the moon smiled at them
above the tree-tops, she elicited but a single observation of her
beauty. The road was lonely and sheltered; bordered by forests on one
side, and thicket-grown banks on the other; the soil sandy and heavy;
the tramp of hoofs scarcely heard, and the wheels rolling with a low,
crushing sound, that, to Ida, was not unmusical. Silver willows, and
twisting 'bamboo' vines, and the long-leaved Typha Latifolia edged the
road; and she watched through the openings in the woven screen, for a
glimpse of the stream that watered their roots; sometimes deceived
by the shimmer of the moon upon the leaves; sometimes, by the white
sands, until she doubted whether there was indeed one there;--when the
gurgling of falling waters betrayed the modest brooklet, and it widened
into a pretty pool; the moon's silver shield upon its bosom. The
thicket became taller, and not so dense; tulip trees and oaks in place
of the aquatic undergrowth; and between them the fleeting glimmerings
of the sky were, to her, an army of pale spectres, marching noiselessly
past; no halting or wavering; on, on, in unbroken cavalcade, "down
to the dead." And memory, at fancy's call, produced the long roll
of those who had gone to the world of shades;--the master-spirits
of all ages;--the oppressed and the oppressor;--the lovely and the
loved;--had joined that phantom procession;--how few leaving even the
legacy of a name to earth! With the Persian Poet, her heart cried
out--"Where are they?" and echo answered--"Where are they?" And thought
poured on thought, under the weird influence of that enchanted night,
until the shadowy host was the one reality in the landscape; and one
and another beckoned and waved to her, as they defiled by. She came
near shrieking--so startled was she--as a horseman reined up at the
window. The moon was at his back; but showed every lineament of her
countenance. He raised his hat. "Miss Ross, I believe. I fear my sudden
appearance has alarmed you."

"Arthur! my boy! how are you?" exclaimed Dr. Carleton, extending his
hand, which was as eagerly seized. "Miss Ross--Dr. Dana."

"Miss Ross will excuse me for having anticipated the introduction,"
said he, bowing again, and rode to the opposite side of the carriage.
The greetings there were more quiet; but it needed not Ida's delicate
ear to detect the feeling in the voices which tried to say common-place
things. Arthur had much to say to the doctor, and once in a while a
remark for her--Carry remaining in the back-ground.

"Were you uneasy that we did not arrive?" asked Dr. Carleton.

"Not uneasy--but restless; and to relieve my impatience rode out to
meet you."

He was first on this side--now on that--as the highway afforded him
room; but Ida could not get a view of his face. His figure was good,
and he sat his horse well;--upon these facts, and such impressions as
were made by a pleasant voice and gentlemanly address, she was obliged
to form her opinion of his personal appearance, until more light should
be shed upon the subject. The house appeared, approached by a shady
lane, and so embowered in trees, that only the chimneys were visible
from the main road. Carry's tongue was unloosed as she bounded into
the midst of the sable throng that swarmed about the carriage. Arthur
exclaimed merrily at the clamor of blessings and inquiries.

"Will you accept me as your attendant, Miss Ross? The ceremony of
reception will last some time."

But Carry was in the piazza as soon as they were.

"Thank you, Arthur, for taking charge of her. Welcome to Poplar-grove,
dear Ida! May you be as happy here as I have been!"

"Amen!" said Dr. Carleton and Arthur, heartily.

Carry acted like a wild creature all the evening. She half-carried Ida
to her chamber, and kissed her over and over.

"Now, darling!" she ran on, strewing their shawls and bonnets in all
directions. "You see I have no idea of putting you off, company style,
in another room. You will be with me morning, noon, and night. My dear,
dear room! how natural it looks! and to think I am never to leave it
again!"

"Bless your heart!" said a middle-aged mulatto woman, whose mild and
pleasing face struck Ida as much as her motherly kindness to her young
mistress, "You are not half so glad to get back as we are to have you
here."

"Hush, Mammy! you will make me cry. Comb my hair--will you? Not that I
do not believe you could do it, Sally; but it used to be Mammy's work."

"Thoughtful of others still," reflected Ida, as the girl Sally
displayed a double row of ivories, at Carry's apology. "Can nothing
make her selfish?"

"We won't waste time by an elaborate toilet, dear," said Carry, seeing
Ida deliberating upon two dresses. "Father will be too much engaged
with his supper to notice our dress. Wear the plain white one; it is
very becoming; and remember, you are in the back-woods."

Arthur was in the parlor when they descended. He looked as happy as
Carry, and "almost as good," thought Ida. She was not de trop; it
might have been a brother and sister who strove to convince her that
this, their home, was hers for the time-being. The supper-table was set
with taste and profusion. Ida wondered whether the menage were entirely
controlled by coloured servants. She learned afterwards that "Mammy,"
trained by Mrs. Carleton, and until that lady's death, her constant
attendant, was housekeeper.

"You have not much affection for a city life, Miss Ida," said Arthur,
continuing a conversation commenced in the parlor.

"No. I am country-bred, and cherish a preference for the scenes of my
childhood. Perhaps," she said, ingenuously, "the fault is in myself. I
did not want to live in Richmond, and determined not to like it."

"And are your aversions so strong that the manifold attractions of the
metropolis cannot shake them? or, are you countrified upon principle?"

"I have not given the city a fair trial. It has occurred to me lately
that my weariness of it proceeded from monotony rather than satiety.
There is little variety in school life."

"Except when we regard it as the world in miniature," said Arthur. "It
is different, doubtless, in 'Young Lady Establishments,' but we boys
contrived to maintain a healthy circulation, one way or another."

"Is it not a popular fallacy that school-days are the happiest of one's
life?" asked Ida.

"Unquestionably," rejoined he, promptly. "As well say that Spring is
the farmer's happiest season. He has the pleasures of hope, the delight
of viewing his whitening harvests in futuro; but there is severe,
unromantic drudgery; suspense and boding fears for the result. The
'harvest home' for me!"

"And when is that!" questioned Ida.

"Now!" said he, with emphasis.

"What do you mean?" inquired Carry.

"That you and Miss Ida begin to reap from this date. To dispense with
this inconvenient metaphor, your actions will be the proof of what your
lessons have been; every day your knowledge and principles will be
brought into play,--you will be binding up sheaves of worthy or of evil
deeds."

"You are trying to terrify us," said Carry. "Don't you wish yourself at
school again, Ida!"

"Are you sorry you're a-goin' to turn out!" replied Ida, in a
peculiar tone.

"Oh, Celestia!" exclaimed Carry, with a burst of laughter.

"Who? what?" said her father.

"One of our school-mates, father; who, hearing another say that she was
sorry to quit school, went through the house the day we were dismissed,
asking each one confidentially, 'Are you sorry you're a-goin to turn
out?' grief at such an event being, in her code, a more heinous sin
than to dance at a funeral."

"Who was she?" asked Arthur.

"Miss Pratt--Celestia Pratt."

"Daughter of the member from A----?"

"The same--what do you know of her?"

"I met her once at a ball," he replied.

"Were you introduced?" cried both girls in a breath.

"Yes; and danced with her."

"Enough!" said Carry. "We will not pursue the subject."

"As you please," he returned; "but if I am not mistaken, as Sir Roger
says, though with a different meaning, 'much could be said on both
sides.'"




CHAPTER VIII.


Poplar-Grove was comparatively a modern place; having been built by the
present proprietor at the time of his marriage. The house was of brick,
large and commodious; and flanked by neat out-houses and servants'
quarters, presenting an imposing appearance, an air of lordly beauty.
The shade trees were forest-born; the maple, oak, beech, and fairest
of all, the tulip-poplar. Excepting in the green-house, on the south
side of the mansion, and a rose-creeper that climbed upon the piazza,
not a flower was tolerated within the spacious yard, and the sward was
always green and smooth. Dr. Carleton's seat was the pride and envy of
the country. "No wonder," growled the croakers; "a man with a plenty
of money can afford to be comfortable." They lived in barn-like
structures, treeless and yardless; (and who that has travelled in our
commonwealth, but knows the heart-sickening aspect of these out-of-door
habitations?) raising vegetables, because they must be had to eat;
planting orchards, and suffering them to dwindle and pine, for want
of attention; and existing themselves after the same shambling style,
because they "had it to do;" content to "get along," and not feeling
the need of anything higher, until the buried--not dead--sense of the
beautiful was exhumed by the sight of the work of taste and industry;
and the stupid stare was succeeded by jealous repinings, and the
writing down of a long score against Providence. "I tell you what, my
friend," the doctor said to one of these murmurers, "instead of harping
so much upon one P, try my three, and my word for it, your wishes will
be fulfilled sooner by fifty years--they are, Planting, Perseverance
and Paint."

In the garden, beauty and utility joined hands, and danced together
down the walks. There were squares of thrifty vegetables, deserving
a home in the visioned Eden of an ambitious horticulturist; and the
banished floral treasures here expanded in every variety of hue and
fragrance. There grew hedges of roses, and the dwarf lilac, and the
jessamine family, the star, the Catalonian, the white and yellow,
thatching one arbor; while the odorous Florida, the coral, and the more
common but dearer English honeysuckles wreathed their lithe tendrils
over another; and ever-blowing wall-flowers, humble and sweet, gaudy
beds of carnations, and brightly-smiling coreopsis, and pure lilies
with their fragrant hearts powdered with golden dust--a witching
wilderness of delights. Trellises, burdened with ripening grapes, were
the boundary line between the garden and the orchard. The same just
sense of order and well-being regulated the whole plantation. Kindness
was the main-spring of the machinery, but it was a kindness that knew
how to punish as well as reward.

"Do you believe in the unity of the human race?" asked Ida, one
evening, as she and Carry were taking their twilight promenade in the
long parlor.

"Assuredly; but what put that into your head just now?"

"I was thinking of your father; and trying to realize that he belongs
to the same species with others I could name. I am compelled to the
conclusion that he is an appendix, a later creation, a type of what man
would have been had he not 'sought out many inventions.'"

"And what new instance of his immaculateness has induced this sapient
belief?"

"I was sitting at the window this afternoon, before he went out, when
I heard him call to little Dick to bring his saddle-bags from 'the
office.' The boy scampered off, and presently appeared running, still
holding the precious load with great care in both hands. 'Steady,
my lad,' said your father, and as the warning passed his lips, Dick
tripped his foot, and came down--the saddle-bags under him. He cried
loudly, and your father ran to pick him up--what do you suppose he
said!"

"Inquired if he was hurt, of course."

"He did--but reflect! every phial was smashed, and that is no trifle
this far from the city, I take it. Yes--he set the little chap upon his
feet, and asked after the integrity of his bones; and when he sobbed,
'I ain't hurt, sir--but de bottles--dey's all broke!' patted him upon
the head, and bade him 'stop crying--master isn't angry--you won't run
so fast next time,' and let him go. Then, kneeling upon the grass,
he unlocked the portable apothecary-shop, and pulled out gallipots
and packages, fractured and stained in every imaginable shape and
manner--looking seriously perplexed. 'This is an awkward business,'
he said, aloud; 'and my stock is so nearly out! but accidents will
happen.'"

"And is that all?" said Carry.

"'All!' I have seen men affect forbearance, and talk largely of
forgiveness, when they wanted to 'show off,' but he did not know that
I was within hearing. Some other principle was at work. I wonder," she
said, with a short laugh, "what my esteemed guardian would have said
upon the occasion! He punishes a menial more severely for an accident,
or thoughtlessness, than for deliberate villany."

"I do not pretend to uphold Mr. Read's doctrines or practice. I am
afraid he is thoroughly selfish, and Josephine is too close a copy
of him to suit my fancy--but why think or speak of them? Did you not
promise to see life through my spectacles awhile? There is a hard look
in your eye, and a scorn in your tone, when you refer to them, that
repel me. It is so unlike you!"

"So like me, Carry! My character is velvet or fur--stroke it in one
direction, and you enhance whatever of beauty or gloss it possesses;
reverse the motion, and you encounter rough prickles, and in certain
states of the atmosphere, more electricity than is agreeable or safe. I
am not changed. The hand of affection is gliding over me now; you may
do what you will with me."

"But you are happier than you used to be?"

"I am--happier in you! Do you recollect the stormy November evening
when you 'took me in?' Cold, and wet, and shivering as was the body,
the heart stood more in need of comfort; and you warmed it--taught me
that woman is woman still--brow-beaten, insulted, crushed! The poor,
soiled flowerets of love will smile, despite of all--in the face
of him, or her whose pitying hand lifts them up. Carry! you do not
know what depends upon your fidelity! Have you not read in that most
wondrous of books, how the evil spirit returned to the house, which, in
his absence, was swept and garnished, and that the latter end of that
man was worse than the first?"

"Ida! my own friend! how can you hint such frightful things? I do
love you--very dearly? You cannot doubt me."

"Not now. But will the time never come, when other claims will
dispossess me of my place? Do not despise me, darling! Do not impute
to me the meanness of being envious of your happiness. I rejoice with,
and am proud for you--proud of your choice. He is all that a man should
be--let me say it--I have never told you so before;--but is it true
love expels friendship? You will be as dear to me married as single;
why should your affection decrease?"

"It will not!" Could it be the modest Carry who spoke? "Judge for
yourself. Arthur and I have loved from childhood. He spoke to me of
his hopes two years ago, but father exacted from us a promise that no
love but that of brother and sister should be named between us until
my school-days were at an end. Yet I knew that I was not a sister to
him; and, to me, he was more than the world besides:--and with this
sweet consciousness singing its song of hope and blessedness within my
heart, I found room for you; and lover and friend were each the dearer
for the other's company. You will understand this some day, dear Ida.
You are made to be loved--you cannot exist without it, and you will
achieve your destiny."

"That love is to be my redemption, Carry. In the upper region of the
air there is eternal calm and sunshine, while the clouds brood and
crash below. Such calm and light shall my love win for me. I have dwelt
for years in the black, noisome vapors--I am rising now! Is it not
Jean Paul who says--'Love may slumber in a young maiden's heart, but
he always dreams!' I have had dreams--day visions, more transporting
than any the night bestows. I have dreamed that my wayward will bent,
in glad humility, to a stronger and wiser mind;--that my eye fell
beneath the fondness of one that quailed at nothing; that I leaned my
tired head upon a bosom, whose every throb was to me an earnest of
his abiding truth; and drank in the music of a voice, whose sweetest
accent was the low whisper that called me 'his own!' These are not
chance vagaries; they have been the food of my heart for long and
dreary months; angel-voices about my pillow--my companions in the
still twilight hour--summoned by pleasure or pain, to sympathise and
console. Then my breast is a temple, consecrated to an ideal, but none
the less fervent in the devotion offered therein; the hoarded riches
of a lifetime are heaped upon his shrine. I have imagined him high in
the world's opinion; doing his part nobly in the strife of life;--and
I, unawed by the laurel-crown--unheeding it--say, 'Love me--only love
me!' I love to fancy, and feel him present, and sing to him the strains
which gush from my soul at his coming. This is one."

She left Carry's side. A lightly-played prelude floated through the
darkening room, then a recitative, of which the words and music seemed
alike born out of the impulse of the hour:

  Thy heart is like the billowy tide
    Of some impetuous river,
  That mighty in its power and pride,
    Sweeps on and on forever.
  The white foam is its battle crest,
    As to the charge it rushes
  And from its vast and panting breast,
    A stormy shout up gushes.

  "Through all--o'er all--my way I cleave--
    Each barrier down-bearing--
  Fame is the guerdon of the brave,
    And victory of the daring!"
  While mine is like the brooklet's flow,
    Through peaceful valley's gliding;
  O'er which the willow boughs bend low
    The tiny wavelet hiding.

  And as it steals on, calm and clear,
    A little song 'tis singing,
  That vibrates soft upon the ear,
    Like fairy vespers ringing.
  "Love me--love me!" it murmurs o'er,
    'Midst light and shadows ranging,
  "Love me," It gurgles evermore,
    The burden never changing.

  Thine is the eagle's lofty flight,
    With ardent hope, aspiring
  E'en to the flaming source of light,
    Undoubling and untiring.
  Glory, with gorgeous sunbeam, throws
    An Iris mantle o'er thee--
  A radiant present round thee glows--
    Deathless renown before thee.

  And I, like a shy, timid dove,
    That shuns noon's fervid beaming,
  And far within the silent grove,
    Sits, lost in loving dreaming--
  Turn, half in joy, and half in fear,
    From thine ambitions soaring,
  And seek to hide me from the glare,
    That o'er thy track is pouring.

  I cannot echo back the notes
    Of triumph thou art pealing,
  But from my woman's heart there floats
    The music of one feeling,
  One single, longing, pleading moan,
    Whose voice I cannot smother--
  "Love me--love me!" its song alone,
    And it will learn no other!

There was a long stillness. Carry was weeping silently. She was a
novice to the world, and believed that many were guileless and loving
as herself; but she felt, as she listened to this enthusiastic outflow
from ice-girt depths, unfathomable to her, unsuspected by others,
that terrible woe was in reserve for the heart so suddenly unveiled.
There was, about Ida, when her real character came into action, an
earnestness of passion and sentiment that forbade the utterance of
trite counsels or cautions; the tide would have its way, and one must
abide its ebb in patience. Her first words showed that it had retired.

"I appear strangely fitful to your gentle little self, dear one. It is
seldom that I yield to these humours. You have pierced to the bottom
of my heart to-night;" linking her arm again in Carry's. "Forget my
vehemence, and believe me if you will, the iceberg people say I am."

"Never! oh, Ida! Why do yourself such injustice? Why not let your
friends know that you have feeling? They would love you but the more."

"Do not believe it. I should be sent to the Insane Hospital. Hearts are
at a discount in the market just now, and hypocrisy above par."

"There you go!" exclaimed Carry. "One moment all softness--the next,
an ocean is between us. Contradictory enigma! If I loved you less,
I should be angry. You read every leaf of my heart as easily as you
unfold a newspaper; and just as I fancy that I have the key to yours,
it is shut close--a casket, whose spring I cannot find."

"Or like an oyster," said Ida. "Apropos de bottes--here come the
candles, harbingers of supper, and I hear our brace of Esculapii, upon
the porch, ready to discuss it."

Carry asked herself if it could be the impassioned improvisatrice,
who charmed her father and Arthur into forgetfulness of professional
anxieties, and the attractions of the inviting board, by her brilliant
play of wit, sparkling and pleasant as foam upon champagne, without
its evanescence. The gentlemen admired and liked her. That they
unconsciously identified her with Carry, may have accounted for this,
in part, but most was owing to her powers of pleasing. An inquiry, made
with extreme gravity, as to the number and welfare of their patients,
was the preface to a burlesque sketch of the saddle-bag scene; in
which, not a hint of the reflections it inspired, escaped her; and
when she described the doctor's rueful countenance, as he held up the
neck and stopple of a large phial, saying dolefully, "The Calomel too,
and three cases of fever on hand!" Arthur resigned knife and fork,
in despair of eating another mouthful, and Dr. Carleton drew out his
Bandanna to wipe off the coursing tears.

"Hist," said Ida, her finger uplifted, "some one is coming!" The roll
of an approaching vehicle was plainly heard; the coachman's sharp
"Whoa!" followed by a cheer, in sound like a view-hallo, but it said,
"Ship ahoy!"

"Charley! Charley!" screamed Carry, upsetting the tea-urn on her way to
the door, pursued by Arthur and Dr. Carleton. Ida went as far as the
porch. She heard Mrs. John Dana's voice, then her husband's; and Elle's
incoherent response to the efforts made to awaken her; but the stranger
was chief spokesman. "Look after your wife and the baggage, John; I
will disembark the lighter freight. Elle! Elle! don't you want to see
Aladdin's lamp? Aha! well, here is something prettier--Aunt Carry, and
a nice supper. Charley! you monkey! wide awake as usual! Feel if you
have your own head, my boy! People are apt to make mistakes in the
dark. Give me that small-sized bundle, Jenny--you'll lose it in the
weeds, and then there will be the mischief to pay. One, two, three, all
right!" And with the "small-sized bundle" in his arms, he marched up
the walk, Carry scolding and laughing.

"Charley! you are too bad! give her to me--a pretty figure you are,
playing nurse!"

"He has carried her, or Elle, before him, on the horse, all the way!"
said Mrs. Dana. "Ida, my love, how do you do?" warmly kissing her. John
Dana shook hands with her, and Elle cried, "Cousin Ida! you here at
grandpa's!"

Charley gave a comic glance at his burden, when he was presented; but
his bow was respectful, and as graceful as the case admitted. Ida
hardly saw him until the second supper was served; Carry insisting
that she should occupy her accustomed seat, and go through the
form of eating. Elle petitioned for a chair by her, and the three
brothers were together on the opposite side of the table. They were an
interesting study. John, with his strong, dark, yet singularly pleasing
physiognomy, was the handsomest; but his precedence in age, and perhaps
rougher experiences in life, had imparted an air of command, which,
while it became him well, deterred one from familiarity. Charley was so
unlike him, that the supposition of their being of the same lineage,
seemed absurd. His hair and complexion were many shades lighter, and
the features cast in a different mould, his eyes the only fine ones in
the set. He was not so tall, by half a head, and more slightly built.
Arthur was the connecting link; with John's height, and Charley's
figure; the perfect mouth and teeth of one; the brown eyes of the
other; and hair and skin a juste milieu between the two. Ida's
attention was most frequently directed to the new-comer. She thought
him more homely than his brothers; and it certainly was not a family
resemblance that troubled her with the notion, that she had seen him
somewhere not very long ago--when, she could not say--except that his
expression was not the same as now. Heedless of her observation, he
rattled on; doing ample justice to the edibles, in some unaccountable
manner; his gastronomical and vocal apparatus never interfering; yet
withal, he was an excellent listener; and allowed the rest of the party
to say whatever they wished. "He would be worth his weight in gold to
a comic almanac-maker," thought Ida, as he dashed off caricature and
anecdote, conveying a character in an epithet, and setting the table
in a roar, by a grimace or inflection. His pictures, however, were
coloured by his gay mood; there were no frowning portraits, and their
smiles were all broad grins.

"You have not learned to love buttermilk, yet, Charley?" said Carry, as
John called for a second tumbler of the cooling beverage.

"Can't say that I have. Did I write you an account of my begging
expedition?"

"Begging! no--tell me now."

"It was in the Valley. Fitzgerald and I--you know Fitz., Arthur--were
on a hunting frolic. We went up on the mountains, and fell in with game
in abundance, but despicable accommodations. We were at it for three
days. The first night we 'camped out,' gipsy style; built a rousing
fire to scare the wild beasts; wrapped our dreadnoughts around us, and
'lay, like gentlemen taking a snooze,' feet towards the fire, and faces
towards the moon. I had made up my mind that there would be precious
little romance, and less comfort, in this very roomy hotel; but Fitz.
was sentimentally inclined, and I let him alone. 'A life in the woods
for me!' said he, as he stretched himself upon the ground. I was fast
asleep in two minutes, so far as sounds went. 'Charley!' he exclaimed,
at my heavy breathing. 'Pshaw! he's off! he has no more poetry in him
than there is in a--rock!"

"I guessed that he was helped to this illustration, by his discovery of
the quantity of the substance in the soil thereabouts, for he shifted
his position. He was tolerably still for about five minutes; then there
was a jerk, and 'I have not picked the softest spot, surely!' After
another season of quiet came, 'How he sleeps! If he were to swap sides
with me, he would not be disturbing the echoes in that style!'

"A brief objurgation to an unnamed annoyance, was comment fourth. I
slept on perseveringly. He bore it for an hour, and then got up and
mended the fire, by which he was moodily seated, when I awoke from my
first nap. 'Hallo!' said I, rubbing my eyes, 'Is it morning?' 'No!
and what's more, I don't believe it's ever coming?' with a savage
accent. 'Ah well! just hail me when it does break,' and I dropped back
'That is more than flesh and blood can bear!' said he, with awful
deliberateness, 'Here I can't get a wink of sleep, and you are snoring
away with a forty horse power. Maybe you think you are on a feather
bed, man!' fiercely ironical.

"'A feather bed!' just opening my eyes--'a feather bed is nothing to
it, Fitz.'

"'I believe you!' he said.

"The morning did come, and we had splendid shooting, and happened on a
log cabin that night, where we were permitted to lodge, leaving most of
our game for its mistress, who refused money for her hospitality. By
three o'clock of the last day, we turned our faces towards home, and by
rare luck, overtook a man who lived upon Fitz.'s farm, him we loaded
with our guns and game-bags, he being on horseback, and fresh, we on
foot and tired. Presently a traveller passed us, crossing to the other
side of the road, and eyeing us suspiciously. 'Fitz.,' observed I, 'How
hard that man looked at you. You are not exactly in holiday trim, my
dear fellow!'

"'I haven't seen any man, or thought of myself, I was too much absorbed
in conjecturing how such an ugly creature as you, was ever raised--you
couldn't have been, except in Eastern Virginia.'

"After some sparring, we laid a bet as to how the people of the first
house we came to, would decide the question of our comparative beauty,
'I have it!' said he, 'We are foreigners; talk the most villainous
jargon you can invent, and trust me for the rest. We shall hear
criticisms enough, I'll warrant.'

"We were ripe for fun; and reaching a small farm-house, Fitz. opened
the gate. 'Recollect we know no Inglese!' We were grotesque figures,
wearing bell-crowned hats of white felt, drab wrappers, coated with
mud, and green-hunting shirts. Add a beard of three days' growth, and
brigandish mustachios, and you have our 'picters.' The men were off at
work, but the women peeped at us from all quarters. Fitz. walked meekly
up to a girl who was washing in the yard.

"'Avezyouvuspaimum?'

"'What!' said she, wringing the suds from her hands.

"'Wevusivusfaimetsoif,' winking at me for confirmation.

"'Yaw! pax vobiscum!' returned I, in imitation of poor Wamba; and
pointing into my throat.

"'Two forrinners,' said an older woman. 'Come, see 'em, chillen.'

'You are hungry, ain't you?' said the girl.

"'Novuscomprendum.'

"'And thirsty, too?' to me.

"I put my finger to my mouth, with a voracious snap. Away she ran, and
was back in a minute, with a plate of cold Irish potatoes and a bowl of
buttermilk; a younger sister following with another."

"What did you do?"

"I drank it! absolutely! I, who had never looked at a churn without
shuddering. I desired to make a favorable impression. The children
were gaping at the sights; and I contrived, before handing the bowl to
one of them, to drop a piece of money into the milk left in the bottom
'for manners.' I wished it back in my pocket, as the old hag, after a
prolonged stare, pointed her skinny hand at me, 'Sary, I think this
'ere one is rayther the wuss looking, don't you?'

"Fitz. burst into a laugh, that scared them all in one direction, while
we beat a retreat in the other."

"A hearty laugh helpeth digestion," said Dr. Carleton, setting back in
his chair. "Miss Ida, if you and Charley will undertake my practice, I
am in hopes that the casualty of the afternoon will be less disastrous
than we apprehend."

"What casualty?" asked Charley.

The doctor explained:

"And you seize upon a prime lot of choice spirits, as a substitute for
your tinctures and drugs. Fie, Doctor! I thought you were a temperance
man!"

"I have the best right to your services," said Carry, clasping her
hands around his arm, and walking with him towards the parlor. "And I
forewarn you, I have enough for you to do. Ida and I have moped here
