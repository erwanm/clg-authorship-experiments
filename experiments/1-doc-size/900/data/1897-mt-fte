TOWN POETRY. 

The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgr, 

For the velvety sod of the Munno Para, 
Where the waters of healing from Muloowurii'e 

Flow dim in the gloaming by YaranyacMA ; 

The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway, 

And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi, 
The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day 

That made him an exile from Jerrilde?ne ; 

The Teawaraute Tumut from Wirrega's glade, 

The Nangkita swallow, the Wallaroo swan, 
They long for the peace of the imarishade 

And thy balmy soft airs, O sweet Mittagong I 

The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun, 

The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath. 
The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won. 

But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death ; 

In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain 

The Yatala Wangary withers and dies. 
And the Worrow Wanilla, demented with pain, 

To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies ; 

Sweet Nangwarry's desolate, Coonamble wails, 

And Tungkillo Kuito in sables is drest, 
For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails 

And the Booleroo life- breeze is dead in the west. 

Mypongo, Kapunda, O slumber no more ! 

Yankalilla, Parawirra, be warned ! 
There's death in the air ! Killanoola, wherefore 

Shall the prayer of Penola be scorned ? 

Cootaniundra, and Takee, and Wakatipu, 

Toowoomba, Kaikoura are lost ! > 
From Onkaparinga to fa Damax irr 

All burn in this hell's holocaust !

Those are good words for poetry. Among the best I have 
ever seen. There are 81 in the list. I did not need them all, 
but I have knocked down 66 of them ; which is a good bag, it 
seems to me, for a person not in the business. Perhaps a poet 
laureate could do better, but a poet laureate gets wages, and 
that is different. When I write poetry I do not get any wages ; 
often I lose money by it. The best word in that list, and the 
most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo. It is a place 
near Sydney, and is a favorite pleasure-resort. It has eight 
O's in it. 




CHAPTER XXXVII. 

To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown ; in the law, conceal- 
ment of it will do.— PudcCnhead Wilson''s New Calendar. 

KA ONDAY, December 23, 1895. Sailed from Sydney for 
Ceylon in the P. & O. steamer Oceana. A Lascar 
" crew mans this ship — the first I have seen. White 

cotton petticoat and pants ; barefoot ; red shawl for belt ; 
straw cap, brimless, on head, with red scarf wound around it ; 
complexion a rich dark brown ; short straight black hair ; 
whiskers fine and silky ; lustrous and intensely black. Mild, 
good faces ; willing and obedient people ; capable, too ; but 
are said to go into hopeless panics when there is danger. They 
are from Bomba}'' and the coast thereabouts. . . . Left 
some of the trunks in Sydney, to be shipped to South Africa 
by a vessel advertised to sail three months hence. The proverb 
says : " Separate not yourself from your baggage." 
This Oceana is a stately big ship, luxuriously appointed. She 
has spacious promenade decks. Large rooms ; a surpassingly 
comfortable ship. The officers' library is well selected ; a 
ship's library is not usually that. . . . For meals, the bugle 
call, man-of-war fashion ; a |)leasant change from the terrible 
gong. . . . Three big cats — very friendly loafers ; they 
wander all over the ship ; the white one follows the chief steward 
around like a dog. There is also a basket of kittens. One of 
these cats goes ashore, in port, in England, Australia, and 
India, to see how his various families are getting along, and is 
seen no more till the ship is ready to sail. No one knows how 
he finds out the sailing date, but no doubt he comes down to 

the dock every day and takes a look, and when he sees bag- 
gage and passengers flocking in, recognizes that it is time to 
get aboard. This is what the sailors believe. . . . The 
Chief Engineer has been in the China and India trade thirty- 
three years, and has had but three Christmases at home in that 
time. . . . Conversational items at dinner , " Mocha ! sold 
all over the world ! It is not true. In fact, very few foreigners 
except the Emperor of Russia have ever seen a grain of it, or 
ever will, while they live." Another man said : " There is no 
sale in Australia for Australian wine. But it goes to France 
and comes back with a French label on it, and then they buy 
it." I have heard that the most of the French-labeled claret 
in New York is made in California. And I remember what 
Professor S. told me once about Veuve Cliquot — if that was 
the wine, and I think it was. He was the guest of a great wine 
merchant whose town was quite near that vineyard, and this 
merchant asked him if very much Y. C. was drunk in 
America. 

" Oh, yes," said S., " a great abundance of it." 

" Is it easy to be bad ? " 

" Oh, yes — easy as water. All first and second-class hotels 
have it," 

" What do you pay for it ? " 

"It depends on the style of the hotel — from fifteen to 
twenty-five francs a bottle." 

" Oh, fortunate country ! Why, it's worth 100 francs right 
here on the ground." 

" No ! " 

" Yes ! " 

" Do you mean that we are drinking a bogus Yeuve Cliquot 
over there ? " 

" Yes — and there was never a bottle of the genuine in 
America since Columbus's time. That wine all comes from a 
little bit of a patch of ground which isn't big enough to raise 
many bottles ; and all of it that is produced goes every year 
to one person — the Emperor of Russia. He takes the whole 
crop in advance, be it big or little." 

January 4, 1896. Christmas in Melbourne, New Year's 
Day in Adelaide, and saw most of the friends again in both 
places. . . . Lying here at anchor all day — Albany (King 
George's Sound), Western Australia. It is a perfectly land- 
locked harbor, or roadstead — spacious to look at, but not deep 
water. Desolate-looking rOcks and scarred hills. Plenty of 
ships arriving now, rushing to the new gold-fields. The papers 
are full of wonderful tales of the sort always to be heard in 
connection with new gold diggings. A sample : a youth staked 
out a claim and tried to sell half for £5 ; no takers ; he stuck 
to it fourteen days, starving, then struck it rich and sold out 
for £10,000. . . . About sunset, strong breeze blowing, 
got up the anchor. We were in a small deep puddle, with a 
narrow channel leading out of it, minutely buoyed, to the sea. 


I stayed on deck to see how we were going to manage it with 
such a big ship and such a strong wind. On the bridge our 
giant captain, in uniform ; at his side a little pilot in elaborately 
gold-laced uniform ; on the forecastle a white mate and quar- 
termaster or two, and a brilliant crowd of lascars standing by 
for business. Our stern was pointing straight at the head of 
the channel ; so we must turn entirely around in the puddle — 
and the wind blowing as described. It was done, and beauti- 
fully. It was done by help of a jib. "We stirred up much 
mud, but did not touch the bottom. We turned right around 
in our tracks — a seeming impossibility. We had several casts 
of quarter-less 5, and one cast of half 4 — 27 feet ; we were 
drawing 26 astern. By the time we were entirely around and 
pointed, the first hnoj was not more than a hundred yards in 
front of us. It was a fine piece of work, and I was the only 
passenger that saw it. However, the others got their dinner ; 
the P. & O. Company got mine. . . . More cats developed. 
Smythe says it is a British law that they must be carried ; and 
he instanced a case of a ship not allowed to sail till she sent 
for a couple. The bill came, too : " Debtor, to 2 cats, 20 shil- 
lings." . . . ]Sews comes that within this week Siam has 
acknowledged herself to be, in effect, a French province. It 
seems plain that all savage and semi-civilized countries are 
going to be grabbed. ... A vulture on board ; bald, red, 
queer-shaped head, featherless red places here and there on 
his body, intense great black eyes set in featherless rims of in- 
flamed flesh ; dissipated look ; a business-like style, a selfish, 
conscienceless, murderous aspect — the very look of a profes- 
sional assassin, and yet a bird which does no murder. What 
was the use of getting him up in that tragic style for so inno- 
cent a trade as his ? For this one isn't the sort that wars upon 
the living, his diet is offal — and the more out of date it is the 
better he likes it. Nature should give him a suit of rusty black ; 



then he would be all right, for he would look like an under- 
taker and would harmonize with his business ; whereas the way 
he is now he is horribly out of true. 

January 5. At 9 this morning we passed Cape Leeuwin 
(lioness) and ceased from our long due-west course along the 
southern shore of Australia. Turning this extreme south- 
western corner, we now take a long straight slant nearly 
IS. W., without a break, for Ceylon. As we speed northward 
it will grow hotter very fast — but it isn't chilly, now. . . . 
The vulture is from the public menagerie at Adelaide — a great 
and interesting collection. It was there that we saw the baby 
tiger solemnly spreading its mouth and trying to roar like its 
majestic mother. It swaggered, scowling, back and forth on 
its short legs just as it had seen her do on her long ones, and 
now and then snarling viciously, exposing its teeth, with a 
threatening lift of its upper lip and bristling moustache ; and 
when it thought it was impressing the visitors, it would spread 
its mouth wide and do that screechy cry which it meant for a 
roar, but which did not deceive. It took itself quite seriously, 
and was lovably comical. And there was a hyena — an ugly 
creature ; as ugly as the tiger-kitty was pretty. It repeatedly 
arched its back and delivered itself of such a human cry ; a 
startling resemblance ; a cry which was just that of a grown 
person badly hurt. In the dark one would assuredly go to its 
assistance — and be disappointed. . . . Many friends of 
Australasian Federation on board. They feel sure that the good 
day is not far off, now. But there seems to be a party that 
would go further — have Australasia cut loose from the British 
Empire and set up housekeeping on her own hook. It seems 
an unwise idea. They point to the United States, but it seems 
to me that the cases lack a good deal of being alike. Austra- 
lasia governs herself wholly — there is no interference; and 
her commerce and manufactures are not oppressed in any way. 

If our case had been the same we should not have gone out 
when we did. 

January 13. Unspeakably hot. The equator is arriving 
again. "We are within eight degrees of it. Ceylon present. 
Dear me, it is beautiful ! And most sumptuously tropical, as 
to character of foliage and opulence of it. " What though the 
spicy breezes blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle" — an eloquent line, an 
incomparable line ; it says little, but conveys whole libraries of 
sentiment, and Oriental charm and mystery, and tropic 
deliciousness — a line that quivers and tingles with a thousand 
unexpressed and inexpressible things, things that haunt one 
and find no articulate voice. . . . Colombo, the capital. 
An Oriental town, most manifestly ; and fascinating. . . . 
In this palatial ship the passengers dress for dinner. The 
ladies' toilettes make a fine display of color, and this is in 
keeping with the elegance of the vessel's furnishings and the 
flooding brilliancies of the electric light. On the stormv 
Atlantic one never sees a man in evening dress, except at the 
rarest intervals ; and then there is only one, not two ; and he 
shows up but once on the voyage — the night before the ship 
makes port — the night when they have the " concert " and do 
the amateur wailings and recitations. He is the tenor, as a 
rule. . . . There has been a deal of cricket-playing on 
board ; it seems a queer game for a ship, but they enclose the 
promenade deck with nettings and keep the ball from flying 
overboard, and the sport goes very well, and is properly violent 
and exciting. . . . "We must part from this vessel here. 

Jamiary llf.. Hotel Bristol. Servant Brompy. Alert, 
gentle, smiling, winning young brown creature as ever was. 
Beautiful shining black hair combed back like a woman's, and 
knotted at the back of his head  tortoise-shell comb in it, 
sign that he is a Singhalese ; slender, shapely form ; jacket ; 
under it is a beltless and flowing white cotton gown — from 

neck straight to heel ; he and his outfit quite unmasculine. It 
was an embarassment to undress before him. 

We drove to the marlcet, using the Japanese jinriksha — 
our first acquaintanceship with it. It is a light cart, with a 
native to draw it. He makes good speed for half-an-hour, but 
it is hard work for him ; he is too slight for it. After the 
half-hour there is no more pleasure for you ; your attention is 
all on the man, just as it would be on a tired horse, and 
necessarily your sympathy is there too. There's a plenty of 
these 'rickshas, and the tariff is incredibly cheap. 

I was in Cairo years ago. That was Oriental, but there 
was a lack. When you are in Florida or New Orleans you are 
in the South — that is granted ; but you are not in the South ; 
you are in a modified South, a tempered South. Cairo was 
a tempered Orient — an Orient with an indefinite something 
wanting. That feeling was not present in Ceylon. Ceylon 
was Oriental in the last measure of completeness — utterly 
Oriental ; also utterly tropical ; and indeed to one's unreason- 
ing spiritual sense the two things belong together. All the 
requisites were present. The costumes were right ; the black 
and brown exposures, unconscious of immodesty, were right ; 
the juggler was there, with his basket, his snakes, his mon- 
goose, and his arrangements for growing a tree from seed to 
foliage and ripe fruitage before one's eyes ; in sight were plants 
and flowers familiar to one on books but in no other way — 
celebrated, desirable, strange, but in production restricted to 
the hot belt of the equator ; and out a little way in the country 
were the proper deadly snakes, and fierce beasts of prey, and 
the wild elephant and the monkey. And there was that swoon 
in the air which one associates with the tropics, and that 
smother of heat, heavy with odors of unknown flowers, and 
that sudden invasion of purple gloom fissured with lightnings, 
— then the tumult of crashing thunder and the downpour — 

and presently all sunny and smiling again; all these things 
were there ; the conditions were complete, nothing was lack- 
ing. And away off in the deeps of the jungle and in the re- 
motenesses of the mountains were the ruined cities and 
mouldering temples, mysterious relics of the pomps of a for- 
gotten time and a vanished race — and this was as it should be, 
also, for nothing is quite satisfyingly Oriental that lacks the 
somber and impressive qualities of mystery and antiquity. 

The drive through the town and out to the Galle Face by 
the seashore, what a dream it was of tropical splendors of 
bloom and blossom, and Oriental conflagrations of costume ! 
The walking groups of men, women, boys, girls, babies — each 
individual was a flame, each group a house afire for color. 
And such stunning colors, such intensely vivid colors, such rich 
and exquisite minglings and fusings of rainbows and light- 
nings ! And all harmonious, all in perfect taste ; never a dis- 
cordant note ; never a color on any person swearing at another 
color on him or failing to harmonize faultlessly with the colors 
of any group the wearer might join. The stuffs were silk — 
thin, soft, delicate, clinging ; and, as a rule, each piece a solid 
color : a splendid green, a splendid blue, a splendid yellow, a 
splendid purple, a splendid ruby, deep, and rich with smoulder- 
ing fires — they swept continuously by in crowds and legions 
and multitudes, glowing, flashing, burning, radiant ; and every 
five seconds came a burst of blinding red that made a body 
catch his breath, and filled his heart with joy. And then, the 
unimaginable grace of those costumes ! Sometimes a woman's 
whole dress was but a scarf wound about her person and her 
head, sometimes a man's was but a turban and a careless rag 
or two — in both cases generous areas of polished dark skin 
showing — but always the arrangement compelled the homage 
of the eye and made the heart sing for gladness. 

I can see it to this day, that radiant panorama, that wilderness
of rich color, that incomparable dissolving-view of 
harmonious tints, and lithe half-covered forms, and beautiful 
brown faces, and gracious and graceful gestures and attitudes 
and movements, free, unstudied, barren of stiffness and 
restraint, and — 

Just then, into this dream of fairyland and paradise a grat- 
ing dissonance was injected. Out of a missionary school came 
marching, two and two, sixteen prim and pious little Christian 
black girls, Europeanly clothed — dressed, to the last detail, as 
they would have been dressed on a summer Sunday in an 
English or American village. Those clothes — oh, they were 
unspeakably ugly ! Ugly, barbarous, destitute of taste, desti- 
tute of grace, repulsive as a shroud. I looked at my women- 
folk's clothes — just full-grown duplicates of the outrages 
disguising those poor little abused creatures — and was 
ashamed to be seen in the street with them. Then I looked at 
my own clothes, and was ashamed to be seen in the street 
with myself. 

However, we must put up with our clothes as they are — 
they have their reason for existing. They are on us to expose 
us — to advertise what we wear them to conceal. They are a 
sign ; a sign of insincerity ; a sign of suppressed vanity ; a 
pretense that we despise gorgeous colors and the graces of 
harmony and form ; and we put them on to propagate that lie 
and back it up. But we do not deceive our neighbor; and 
when we step into Ceylon we realize that we have not even 
deceived ourselves. We do love brilliant colors and graceful 
costumes ; and at home we will turn out in a storm to see 
them when the procession goes by — and envy the wearers. 
We go to the theater to look at them and grieve that we can't 
be clothed like that. We go to the King's ball, when we get a 
chance, and are glad of a sight of the splendid uniforms and 
the glittering orders. When we are granted permission to 

attend an imperial drawing-room we shut ourselves up in 
private and parade around in the theatrical court-dress by the 
hour, and admire ourselves in the glass, and are utterly happy ; 
and every member of every governor's staff in democratic 
America does the same with his grand new uniform — and if 
he is not watched he will get himself photographed in it, too. 
When I see the Lord Mayor's footman I am dissatisfied with 
my lot. Yes, our clothes are a lie, and have been nothing 
short of that these hundred years. They are insincere, they 
are the ugly and appropriate outward exposure of an inward 
sham and a moral decay. 

The last little brown boy I chanced to notice in the crowds 
and swarms of Colombo had nothing on but a twine string 
around his waist, but in my memory the frank honesty of his 
costume still stands out in pleasant contrast with the odious 
flummery in which the little Sunday-school dowdies were 
masquerading. 




CHAPTER XXXYIII. 

Prosperity is the best protector of principle. — Fudd''7ihead Wilson''sNew Calendar. 

EYENIN"G — yA. Sailed in the Rosetta. This is a 
poor old ship, and ought to be insured and sunk. As 
in the Oceana, just so here: everybody dresses for 
dinner; they make it a sort of pious duty. These fine and 
formal costumes are a rather conspicuous contrast to the 
poverty and shabbiness of the surroundings. ... If you 
want a slice of a lime at four o'clock tea, you must sign an 
order on the bar. Limes cost 14 cents a barrel. 

January 18th. We have been running up the Arabian 
Sea, latterly. Closing up on Bombay now, and due to arrive 
this evening. 

January Oth. Bomhay ! A bewitching place, a bewil- 
dering place, an enchanting place — the Arabian Nights come 
again! It is a vast city ; contains about a million inhabitants. 
Natives, they are, with a slight sprinkling of white people — 
not enough to have the slightest modifying effect upon the 
massed dark complexion of the public. It is winter here, yet 
the weather is the divine weather of June, and the foliage is the 
fresh and heavenly foliage of June. There is a rank of noble 
great shade trees across the way from the hotel, and under 
them sit groups of picturesque natives of both sexes ; and the 
juggler in his turban is there with his snakes and his magic ; 
and all day long the cabs and the multitudinous varieties of 
costumes flock by. It does not seem as if one could ever get 
tired of watching this moving show, this shining and shifting 
spectacle. ... In the great bazar the pack and jam of 

natives was marvelous, the sea of rich-colored turbans and 
draperies an inspiring sight, and the quaint and showy Indian 
architecture was just the right setting for it. Toward sunset 
another show ; this is the drive around the sea-shore to Mala- 
bar Point, where Lord Sandhurst, the Governor of the Bom- 
bay Presidency, lives. Parsee palaces all along the first part 
of the drive; and past them all the world is driving; the 
private carriages of wealthy Englishmen and natives of rank 
are manned by a driver and three footmen in stunning oriental 
liveries — two of these turbaned statues standing up behind, as 
fine as monuments. Sometimes even the public carriages 
have this superabundant crew, slightly modified — one to 
drive, one to sit by and see it done, and one to stand up 
behind and yell — yell when there is anybody in the way, and 
for practice when there isn't. It all helps to keep up the live- 
liness and augment the general sense of swiftness and energy 
and confusion and pow-wow. 

In the region of Scandal Point — felicitous name — where 
there are handy rocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on 
the one hand, and on the other the passing and repassing 
whirl and tumult of gay carriages, are great groups of comfort- 
ably-off Parsee women — perfect flower-beds of brilliant color, 
a fascinating spectacle. Tramp, tramp, tramping along the 
road, in singles, couples, groups, and gangs, you have the 
working-man and the working- woman — but not clothed like 
ours.. Usually the man is a nobly-built great athlete, with not 
a rag on but his loin-handkerchief; his color a deep dark 
brown, his skin satin, his rounded muscles knobbing it as if it 
had eggs under it. Usually the woman is a slender and 
shapely creature, as erect as a lightning-rod, and she has but 
one thing on — a bright-colored piece of stuff which is wound 
about her head and her bod} down nearly half-way to her 
knees, and which clings like her own skin. Her legs and feet 
are bare, and so are her arms, except for her fanciful bunches 
of loose silver rings on her ankles and on her arms. She has 
jewelry bunched on the side of her nose also, and showy 
cluster-rings on her toes. When she undresses for bed she 
takes off her jewelry, I suppose. If she took off anything 
more she would catch cold. As a rule she has a large shiney 
brass water-jar of graceful 
shape on her head, and 
one of her naked arms 
curves up and the hand 
holds it there. She is so 
straight, so erect, and she 
steps with such style, and 
such easy grace and dig- 
nity ; and her curved arm 
and her brazen jar are 
such a help to the picture 
— indeed, our working- 
women cannot begin with 
her as a road-decoration. 

It is all color, bewitch- 
ing color, enchanting 
color — everywhere — all 
around — all the way 
around the curving great 
opaline bay clear to Government House, where the tur])aned 
big native chuprassies stand grouped in state at the door in 
their robes of fiery red, and do most properly and stunningly 
finish up the splendid show and make it theatrically complete. 
I wish I were a chuprassy. 

This is indeed India ! the land of dreams and romance, of 
fabulous wealth and fabulous poverty, of splendor and rags, 
of palaces and hovels, of famine and pestilence, of genii and 


giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigers and elephants, the cobra 
and the jungle, the country of a hundred nations and a 
hundred tongues, of a thousand religions and two million gods, 
cradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech, mother 
of history, grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of 
tradition, whose yesterdays bear date with the mouldering 
antiquities of the rest of the nations — the one sole country 
under the sun that is endowed with an imperishable interest 
for alien prince and alien peasant, for lettered and ignorant, 
wise and fool, rich and poor, bond and free, the one land that 
all men desire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, 
would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of 
the globe combined. 

Even now, after the lapse of a year, the delirium of those 
days in Bombay has not left me, and I hope never will. It 
was all new, no detail of it hackneyed. And India did not 
wait for morning, it began at the hotel — straight away. The 
lobbies and halls were full of turbaned, and fez'd and em- 
broidered, cap'd, and barefooted, and cotton-clad dark natives, 
some of them rushing about, others at rest squatting, or 
sitting on the ground ; some of them chattering with energy, 
others still and dreamy ; in the dining-room every man's own 
private native servant standing behind his chair, and dressed 
for a part in the Arabian Nights. 

Our rooms were high up, on the front. A white man — 
he was a burly German — went up with us, and brought three 
natives along to see to arranging things. About fourteen others 
followed in procession, with the hand-baggage ; each carried 
an. article — and only one ; a bag, in some cases, in other cases 
loss. One strong native carried my overcoat, another a parasol, 
another a box of cigars, another a novel, and the last man in 
tlie procession had no load but a fan. It was all done with 
earnestness and sincerity, there was not a smile in the procession
from the head of it to the tail of it. Each man waited 
patiently, tranquilly, in no sort of hurry, till one of us found 
time to give him a copper, then he bent his head reverently, 
touched his forehead with his fingers, and went his way. They 
seemed a soft and gentle race, and there was something both 
winning and touching about their demeanor. 

There was a vast glazed door which opened upon the 
balcony. It needed closing, or cleaning, or something, and a 
native got down on his knees and went to work at it. He 
seemed to be doing it well enough, but perhaps he wasn't, for 
the burly German put on a look that betrayed dissatisfaction, 
then without explaining what was wrong, gave the native a 
brisk cuff on the jaw and then told him where the defect was. 
It seemed such a shame to do that before us all. The native 
took it with meekness, saying nothing, and not showing in his 
face or manner any resentment. I had not seen the like of 
this for fifty years. It carried me back to my boyhood, and 
flashed upon me the forgotten fact that this was the usual 
way of explaining one's desires to a slave. I was able to re- 
member that the method seemed right and natural to me in 
those days, I being born to it and unaware that elsewhere there 
were other methods ; but I was also able to remember that 
those unresented cuffings made me sorry for the victim and 
ashamed for the punisher. My father was a refined and kindly 
gentleman, very grave, rather austere, of rigid probity, a 
sternly just and upright man, albeit he attended no church and 
never spoke of religious matters, and had no part nor lot in 
the pious joys of his Presbyterian family, nor ever seemed to 
suffer from this deprivation. He laid his hand upon me in 
punishment only twice in his life, and then not heavily ; once 
for telling him a lie — which surprised me, and showed me 
how unsuspicious he was, for that was not my maiden effort. 
He punished me those two times only, and never any other 
member of the family at all ; yet every now and then he cuffed 
our harmless slave boy, Lewis, for trifling little blunders and 
awkardnesses. My father had passed his life among the slaves 
from his cradle up, and his cuffings proceeded from the custom 
of the time, not from his nature. When I was ten years old 
I saw a man fling a lump of iron-ore at a slave-man in anger, 
for merely doing something awkwardly — as if that were a 
crime. It bounded from the man's skull, and the man fell and 
never spoke again. He was dead in an hour. I knew the man 
had a right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet it seemed 
a pitiful thing and somehow wrong, though wliy wrong I was 
not deep enough to explain if I had been asked to do it. 
iSTobody in the village approved of that murder, but of course 
no one said much about it. 

It is curious — the space-annihilating power of thought. 
For just one second, all that goes to make the me in me was 
in a Missourian village, on the other side of the globe, vividly 
seeing again these forgotten pictures of fifty years ago, and 
wholly unconscious of all things but just those ; and in the next 
second I was back in Bombay, and that kneeling native's 
smitten cheek was not done tingling yet ! Back to boyhood 
— fifty years ; back to age again, another fifty; and a flight 
equal to the circumference of the globe — all in two seconds 
by the watch ! 

Some natives — I don't remember how many — went into 
my bedroom, now, and put things to rights and arranged the 
mosquito-bar, and I went to bed to nurse my cough. It was 
about nine in the evening. What a state of things ! For three 
hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the hall continued, 
along with the velvety patter of their swift bare feet — what a 
racket it wafj ! They were yelling orders and messages down 
three flights. Why, in the matter of noise it amounted to a 
riot, an insurrection, a revolution. And then there were other 
noises mixed up with these and at intervals tremendously 
accenting them — roofs falling in, I judged, windows smash- 
ing, persons being murdered, crows squawking, and deriding, 
and cursing, canaries screeching, monkeys jabbering, m.acaws 
blaspheming, and every now and then fiendish bursts of laugh- 
ter and explosions of dynamite. By midnight I had suffered 
all the different kinds of shocks there are, and knew that I 
could never more be disturbed by them, either isolated or in 
combination. Then came peace — stillness deep and solemn — 
and lasted till five. 

Then it all broke loose again. And who re-started it ? 
The Bird of Birds — the Indian crow. I came to know him 
well, by and by, and be infatuated with him. I suppose he is 
the hardest lot that wears feathers. Yes, and the cheerfulest, 
and the best satisfied with himself. He never arrived at what 
he is by any careless process, or any sudden one ; he is a work 
of art, and " art is long " ; he is the product of immemorial 
ages, and of deep calculation ; one can't make a bird like that 
in a day. He has been re-incarnated more times than Shiva ; 
and he has kept a sample of each incarnation, and fused it into 
his constitution. In the course of his evolutionary promotions, 
his sublime march toward ultimate perfection, he has been a 
gambler, a low comedian, a dissolute priest, a fussy woman, a 
blackguard, a scoffer, a liar, a thief, a spy, an informer, a trad- 
ing politician, a swindler, a professional hypocrite, a patriot 
for cash, a reformer, a lecturer, a lawyer, a conspirator, a rebel, 
a royalist, a democrat, a practicer and propagator of irrever- 
ence, a meddler, an' intruder, a busybody, an infidel, and a 
wallow er in sin for the mere love of it. The strange result, 
the incredible result, of this patient accumulation of all dam- 
nable traits is, that he does not know what care is, he does not 
know what sorrow is, he does not know what remorse is, his life 
is one long thundering ecstasy of happiness, and he will go to his 
death untroubled, knowing that he will soon turn up again as 
an author or soinethitig, and be even more intolerably capable 
and comfortable than ever he was before. 

In his straddling wide forward-step, and his springy side- 
wise series of hops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way 
of canting his head to one side upon occasion, he reminds one 
of the American blackbird. But the sharp resemblances stop 
there. He is much bigger than the blackbird ; and he lacks 
the blackbird's trim and slender and beautiful build and 
shapely beak ; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty 
black is a poor and humble thing compared with the splendid 
lustre of the blackbird's metallic sables and shifting and flash- 
ing bronze glories. The blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in 
deportment and attire, and is not noisy, I believe, except when 
holding religious services and political conventions in a tree ; 
but this Indian sham Quaker is just a rowdy, and is always 
noisy when awake — always chaffing, scolding, scoffing, laugh- 
ing, ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about something 
or other. I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions. 
Nothing escapes him ; he notices everything that happens, and 
brings out his opinion about it, particularly if it is a matter 
that is none of his business. And it is never a mild opinion, 
but always violent — violent and profane — the presence of 
ladies does not affect him. His opinions are not the outcome 
of reflection, for he never thinks about anything, but heaves 
out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is often 
an opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit 
the case. But that is his way ; his main idea is to get out an 
opinion, and if he stopped to think he would lose chances. 

I suppose he has no enemies among men. The whites and 
Mohammedans never seemed to molest him ; and the Hindoos, 
because of their religion, never take the life of any creature, 
but spare even the snakes and tigers and fleas and rats. If I 
sat on one end of the balcony, the crows would gather on the 
railing at the other end and talk about me ; and edge closer, 
little by little, till I could almost reach them ; and they would 
sit there, in the most unabashed way, and talk about my 
clothes, and my hair, and my complexion, "-- ' 

and probable character and vocation and -f'it 
politics, and how I came to be in India, ' 

and what I had been doing, and 

how many days I had got for it, and how I had happened to go unhanged 
so long, and when would it probably come off, and might 

there be more of my sort where I came from, and when would 
they be hanged, — and so on, and so on, until I could not 
longer endure the embarrassment of it; then I would shoo 
them away, and they would circle around in the air a little 
'while, laughing and deriding and mocking, and presently 
settle on the rail and do it all over again. 

They were very sociable when there was anything to eat — 
oppressively so. With a little encouragement they would come 
in and light on the table and help me eat my breakfast ; and 
once when I was in the other room and they found themselves 
alone, they carried off everything they could lift ; and they 
were particular to choose things which they could make no use 
of after they got them. In India their number is beyond esti- 
mate, and their noise is in proportion. I suppose they cost the 
country more than the government does ; yet that is not a 
light matter. Still, they pay ; their company pays ; it would 
sadden the land to take their cheerful voice out of it. 




CHAPTER XXXIX. 

By trying we can easily learu to endure adversity. Another man's, I mean. 

— Puddnhead Wilson's New Calendar. 

YOU soon find your long-ago dreams of India rising in a 
sort of vague and luscious moonlight above the hori- 
zon-rim of your opaque consciousness, and softly light- 
ing up a thousand forgotten details which were parts of a 
vision that had once been vivid to you when you were a boy, 
and steeped your spirit in tales of the East. The barbaric 
gorgeousn esses, for instance ; and the princely titles, the sump- 
tuous titles, the sounding titles, — how good they taste in the 
mouth ! The Nizam of Hyderabad ; the Maharajah of Trav- 
ancore ; the Nabob of Jubbelpore ; the Begum of Bhopal ; the 
Nawab of Mysore; the Eanee of Gulnare ; the Ahkoond of 
Swat's ; the Rao of Rohilkund ; the Gaikwar of Baroda. In- 
deed, it is a country that runs richly to name. The great god 
Yishnu has 108 — 108 special ones — 108 peculiarly holy ones 
— names just for Sunday use only. I learned the whole of 
Vishnu's 108 by heart once, but they wouldn't stay ; I don't 
remember any of them now but John W. 

And the romances connected with those princely native 
houses — to this day they are always turning up, just as in the 
old, old times. They were sweating out a romance in an En- 
glish court in Bombay a while before we were there. In this 
case a native prince, 1C| years old, who has been enjoying his 
titles and dignities and estates unmolested for fourteen years, 
is suddenly haled into court on the charge that he is rightfully 
no prince at all, but a pauper peasant ; that the real prince 


died when two and one-half years old ; that the death was con- 
cealed, and a peasant cliild smuggled into the royal cradle, and 
that this present incumbent was that smuggled substitute. This 
is the very material that so many oriental tales have been made of. 

The case of that great prince, the Gaikwar of Baroda, is a 
reversal of the theme. When that throne fell vacant, no heir 
could be found for some time, but at last one was found in the 
person of a peasant child who was making mud pies in a village 
street, and having an innocent good time. But his pedigree 
was straight ; he was the true prince, and he has reigned ever 
since, with none to dispute his right. 

Lately there was another hunt for an heir to another 
princely house, and one was found who was circumstanced 
about as the Gaikwar had been. His fathers were traced back, 
in humble life, along a branch of the ancestral tree to the point 
where it joined the stem fourteen generations ago, and his 
heirship was thereby squarely established. The tracing was 
done by means of the records of one of the great Hindoo 
shrines, where princes on pilgrimage record their names and 
the date of their visit. This is to keep the prince's religious 
account straight, and his spiritual person safe ; but the record 
has the added value of keeping the pedigree authentic, too. 

When I think of Bombay now, at this distance of time, I
seem to have a kaleidoscope at my eye ; and I hear the clash of 
the glass bits as the splendid figures change, and fall apart, 
and flash into new forms, figure after figure, and with the 
birth of each new form I feel my skin crinkle and ray nerve- 
web tingle with a new thrill of wonder and delight. These 
remembered pictures float past me in a sequence of contracts ; 
following the same order always, and always whirling by and 
disappearing with the swiftness of a dream, leaving me with
