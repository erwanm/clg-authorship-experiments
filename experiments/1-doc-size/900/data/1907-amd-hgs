toils of tea, olives, bonbons, and jokes. 

Helen walked slowly around with her. 
Here were alcoves of the old English poets, 
various editions of Spenser and Chaucer, and 
some going still further back when poetry was 
in the thought rather than rhyme. Here also 
were modern ones, here French, German, and 
Italian in their own language and translation. 
Miss Chardavoyne was a very fair French 
scholar and read a little in Italian, was quite 
conversant with some of the poets, but thought 
Dante just awful. Helen introduced her to 
several girls and presently she saw Leslie 
Brooks enter. 


CHAPTER VII 


WITH A POET 

Leslie looked very grave, she thought, but 
she smiled a little as she advanced and re- 
sponded graciously to the young freshman. 
Miss Chardavoyne was rather awed at first, 
and only ventured the simplest sentences; she 
was not an aggressive girl. But they wan- 
dered to one of the alcoves of poetry where 
there was no one, and sat down. Leslie, with 
her wider experience, began to draw out the 
girl, who flushed and seemed embarrassed, 
and then, as if forgetting, burst into a flood of 
enthusiasm. She looked really very pretty, 
her eyes deep and luminous, the color coming 
and going in her delicate face. 

“ Do you ever try to write out your 
thoughts?” Leslie asked in an interested 
manner. “ It is a wonder you haven’t been 
asked for verses of some sort.” 



“ Oh, I used to at home ! But don't you 
think one must have an inspiration? I used 
to steal away down in the grove and listen 
to the whisper among the trees, broken now 
and then by the mocking-birds, we had so 
many of them, and beautiful chaotic thoughts 
would float through my brain. Sometimes, 
I’d catch just enough for one verse, but the 
rest wouldn't come. I have a great box full 
of them at home. Sister always called them 
rubbish and exhorted me to be practical. That 
seems to me awfully commonplace, though 
some people think there is great virtue in 
commonplaceness. Why, you can learn to 
cook a meal or sweep a house, and we always 
had servants to do that! And I suppose one 
could learn to make gowns. I can design 
beautiful things; Eloise admits that I have 
some ideas there, but she thinks so much 
adornment foolish. And father considers 
nothing worth doing but grand epic poems. 
He knows Milton, most by heart, and the 
‘Course of Time’ — I think that is awfully 
stupid, but Cowper’s ‘ Sofa ’ has some very 
charming lines. When I grew a little older 



— we had a governess — I began to read the 
things I liked best, and I just revel in those 
dainty little poems. They seem to set my 
brain in tune. Oh, I don’t expect to be a real 
poet, but I do think I can write sweeter little 
things than some I see in print! ” 

“ You must send me some of them,” Leslie 
said, persuasively. “ I'll try to get them, or 
at least one, in the Miscellany . We are on the 
lookout for geniuses.” 

“Oh, I should be afraid to! You seniors 
seem so high up. I don’t suppose I shall ever 
be one, and father laughs at a woman’s college 
degree. He was at Williamstown and had a 
year at Oxford. I can have two years here if 
I like.” 

“ What studies interest you most? ” 

“ I like history and literature. I’m just 
shocking in math., and I don’t see any 
sense in some of the ologies. Why should 
you care about worms and insects and beasts 
being made, and what is inside of you, so long 
as it performs all its functions? ” 

“But if it shouldn't?” interrupted Helen 
with a questioning smile. 


 

“ Well, then, you have a doctor. That’s 
what they are for,” triumphantly. “ I like 
beautiful things, and the trees are full of 
grace, most of the flowers, of color. I didn’t 
like the gray sky yesterday; it always gives 
me the shivers.” 

“ But you must be up in certain studies to 
pass. Electives are not merely what you like,” 
suggested Leslie. 

“ Oh,” airily, “I don’t mind! I'm getting 
to like the girls very much. You see it’s the 
pleasant society and taking part in the fun and 
hearing about other girls’ lives, real lives. It 
doesn’t seem as if mine ever had anything in 
it. I’m not commonplace, either.” 

“No, you are not!” responded Leslie. 
“ And you ought to do some very good work 
in the world when you acquire the training.” 

“ Oh, I don’t care about the world — just 
a few of the people I love best ! I want to 
please them.” 

She glanced up out of such eager, beseech- 
ing eyes that Leslie was much moved. 

“ Now,” the senior began, “ I’m going to 
send you home, because I see two girls who 



belong to your hall, and you will have com- 
pany. I am much pleased at meeting you, and 
we will have some more talks about the things 
we like best. I want you to really work over 
your Latin verses, and you may send me some 
of the little poems you write — just about four 
verses; that is the size of the critic editor’s 
patience.” 

“ Oh, how delightful you are ! I’m so glad 
Miss Grant asked me to come. Thank you 
for all the advice.’ ’ 

Leslie beckoned to the two freshmen and put 
her in charge, and the good nights were most 
cordial. 

“ She belongs to a charming, rather incon- 
sequent type of character,” Leslie said with a 
smile, “ quite sensitive to some influences, and 
indifferent to others. She hasn’t much vanity ; 
she loves poetry; whether she has real genius 
remains to be seen. So many girls go through 
this experience. I wrote verses in my fresh- 
man year.” 

“ Truly verses? ” 

“ Yes, verses, not poems. I was an ardent 
lover of several of our so-called younger poets, 


 

and I found my poetic afflatus was imitating 
them. Then I stopped.’ 

“ I don’t see any sense in trying to make a 
student do what is impossible,” said Helen, 
rather lugubriously. “ But,” brightening, “ I 
can do the Latin excellently. I have the foun- 
dation there.” 

“ I think it fortunate we are not all poets 
or novelists or painters. Oh, this lay heavy 
on my heart when I came into the room ! I 
had a note from Mrs. Denman, Lorraine was 
so anxious that she should write. The child 
has an attack of pneumonia, not very serious, 
but the fever is rather stubborn, and you can 
never tell about the first. So there is little 
chance of her getting back under two months.” 

“Oh, that is too bad! We were beginning 
to be such friends. And a vacant room next 
to you — ” 

“ I would like to come and take it. Let us 
both pray for her recovery, and keep an eye 
on our budding poet to see that the pickles and 
caramels and olives and cheese of midnight 
revels do not send her to the other extreme, 
though she shudders over everything in Poe 


except ‘ Annabel Lee,’ which is a very good 
thing for her immature years. She isn't a 
day over sixteen in intellect. And now, good 
night.” 

Helen ran over an exercise and then she 
read the prayer for a sick person, but the tears 
came to her eyes at the sentence, “ Or else 
give her grace so to take thy visitation that 
after this painful life ended — ” No, she 
couldn’t have Lorraine’s life ended when there 
was so much to live for. 

Two days later Miss Chardavoyne waylaid 
her in exercise hour. 

“ I want you to see what was said about 
my Latin. And I did try. I wrote it over 
and over, spending a whole evening upon 
it.” 

Her face was flushed, her tone tremulous, 
and the eyes limpid as if surcharged with a 
flood of tears. Helen read the comment : 

“ Write over. Conception and treatment 
excellent, but refined to weakness in some 
lines. To be made stronger.” 

“ Well, I think that pretty good. How 
many copies did you make ? ” 


 


“ Oh, five or six, parts of ones! ” 

“ Have you saved them? ” 

“ I’m not sure," hesitatingly. 

“ I'd like to see them. We will go to your 
room presently. I’m afraid you did weaken 
them, and you lost the fine temper of the old 
race.” 

“ You see it couldn’t be a translation ex- 
actly.” 

“ Yes, I understand. And I’ll tell you for 
consolation that I had some of my exercises 
too rough, at first." 

“ Oh ! ” There was a touch of joyous relief 
in the tone. 

“ You’ve had other exercises sent back? It 
is a kind of freshman’s luck, discipline. You 
are just beginning college relations. It’s dif- 
ferent from a governess, or even boarding- 
school. But the farther you go, the better you 
like it.” 

“If you didn't have to study so hard every 
day,” regretfully. 

“ Why, there is Saturday and Sunday,” 
smilingly. 

“ And I spent all last Saturday correcting 



and doing things over. The girls went in 
town and had a jolly time.” 

u One gets used to study,” comforted 
Helen. 

“ Didn’t you have any bad times?” was 
the almost reproachful inquiry. 

“ I guess I was a born student.” She saw 
herself again the little girl sitting on Mrs. 
Dayton’s stoop studying for a high school 
examination, and Mr. Warfield — where was 
he? Had he gained some of the things on 
which he had set his heart? 

She went over the fragments with Miss 
Chardavoyne, who had taken out several of 
the stronger adjectives, and really emasculated 
parts of lines. 

“ But it doesn’t sound so beautiful,” she 
said in a disappointed tone. 

“ Not to you, perhaps, but a professor views 
it with a different eye. Now send it in to- 
morrow and take the result philosophically.” 

“ If it is a better verdict, it will be owing to 
you.” 

And very encouraging it certainly was. For 
reward Helen received a poem in her honor 


that transformed her into a Greek goddess, 
with hands dropping gifts to her worshipper. 

Miss Brooks looked it over thoughtfully. 

“ Your modernity has spoiled it, Helen,” 
and she gave a soft laugh. “ It should be 
Strephon to Phyllis. Would she be annoyed 
if I were to ask her to recast it, and explain 
why? There are some real lovers’ sentiments 
in it. The Miscellany has not had anything 
like this in a long time. We have had autum- 
nal verses and climbing heights and dead flow- 
ers and blighting east winds. The only first- 
class thing was about the soldier who died on 
his march to the sea, you remember. It was 
copied in the Bedford Weekly 

“ Oh, do talk to her about it! And I wish 
she wouldn’t put me up on such a pedestal. I 
feel foolish." 

“ This is the penalty for ardent admiration. 
No girl ever fell in love with me to such an 
extent.’’ 

“ She may, presently. They fall desperately 
in love with Carol Saybrook, or she draws 
them by some occult process. Then — I don’t 
know whether she drains them dry, or tires of 



them, or longs for fresh fields — but she 
gently drops them. They are in her room 
sipping tea, chatting, examining her pretty ar- 
ticles, and then — they drop out and it is some 
one else. She is fascinating, I suppose, but not 
really lovable. Some girls are positive studies. 
It is a good thing, I dare say; it prepares you 
for the greater world. I think one learns not 
to expect so much and not to be so deeply 
disappointed in people." 

Miss Brooks asked the young poet to her 
room one evening, keeping herself at leisure, 
and laid before her a plan for the usefulness 
of the poem. 

“ But I didn't mean it for that,” Shirley 
protested. “ It was because — did you ever 
know of a girl falling in love with another 
girl?” and the pretty face flushed scarlet, the 
eyes were wistful with emotion. “ I love Miss 
Grant. I can’t tell you why, only I do. If I 
was boundlessly rich, I’d ask her to share my 
whole life; I'd lavish everything upon her as 
lovers do.” 

“You silly child!” The tone was soft, the 
smile had no irony in it. “ Sometime you 


will settle to a cordial liking for Miss Grant, 
and you may be excellent friends, but you must 
not waste all your energies dreaming about 
her. There are greater problems for you to 
wrestle with, for after all, I think you will not 
purposely bring disrespect upon college train- 
ing. Consider if you do not owe it attention, 
at least.” 

“ But I’m not going in for wisdom,” with 
a faint smile. “ Why, I couldn't understand 
some of the abstruse demands ! I don’t care 
about the grand system of the universe, for 
I shall live in only a little place, and I want 
to be happy and have some one — oh ! several 
people — love me and talk over things with 
me that I enjoy! And Plato and Aristotle — 
oh, yes ! I like the Phsedo, but I don’t under- 
stand it, and I don’t see what good it did to 
have Socrates die. I always want to cry over 
that.” 

“ And you had no real motive in coming to 
college ? ” 

“ Why — yes. I wanted to be with a great 
lot of girls. And I do like it ever so much. 
But Helen Grant is a bright particular star, 



so much above me in strength and knowledge 
that I can worship her without asking much 
back. Perhaps I can’t make you understand. 
I used to try with Eloise, but you see she had 
a lover and thought that was the only thing 
to life, and her ideal was having a pretty 
home and making all manner of furnishings 
for it.” 

Reasoning with her at present would be in 
a circle. Leslie had never met just such a 
girl. She was not silly, though romantic. 

“To come back to the poem : Strephon is 
inditing it to Phyllis among the flowery 
meads, and she must answer instead of dream- 
ing.” 

“ But Phyllis — ” and the girl colored scar- 
let. “ It is such a darkey name. Helen is 
strong and splendid.” 

“ And they are both Grecian. Let us see 
now. Sit down here.” 

She took her pencil and crossed out some 
lines, writing on the margin what she would 
like substituted. 

“ You are very musical,” she said. “ And 
you know a busy senior going in for some of 

the honors wouldn't spend her time over a 
freshman unless she thought there was some- 
thing to her. You must take that for a com- 
pliment. Now dream this out to-night, or 
to-morrow night, and give it to me Saturday 
morning. If you want to save your Helen 
copy intact, do so, and five years from this 
read it over and tell me what you think of it 
then.” 

Shirley gave a long sigh. 

“ I really do want the copy of Phyllis,” and 
the tone was persuasive, almost entreating. 

“ You are very good.'’ Shirley’s voice 
trembled a little, and the humid softness came 
into her eyes, as she passed out of the 
room. 

“ I do wonder if it was wise,” Miss Brooks 
ruminated. “ There are so many half-fledged 
poets in the world, so many who can write an 
averagely good story or essay, and yet never 
come up to any eminence. But they marry, 
and happily that settles it. Only it is really 
funny that her star of light should be Helen.” 

Saturday morning the editors of the Mis- 
cellany sat in solemn conclave. Essays had 



been chosen, there were two bright stories, 
some excellent jokes. 

“ There is one really good poem. Here are 
four that run in the same strain. I wonder 
if old Mother Nature ever gets tired of hear- 
ing herself praised. There’s a space for four 
verses, four lines each. Two of these are too 
long. Girls, I’m never going to edit a paper 
or a magazine, if I go out washing for my 
daily bread and a bottle of olives. I’m dis- 
gusted.” 

“ Read this aloud,” said Miss Brooks. “ Let 
us hear how it sounds.” 

Miss Cairns took the paper, skimmed it 
over, and then read the poem in a very ex- 
pressive voice. The staff had been leaning 
their elbows on the table, but at the second 
verse they straightened up, and began to pay 
attention. A silence followed, and they 
glanced at each other like a party of conspira- 
tors. 

“ Where did you unearth that, Miss Brooks? 
Is it truly original, or copied out of some vol- 
ume of old poems? It is charming and so 
melodious. Why — ” in great surprise. 



“Oh, Miss Brooks did it! It is the expir- 
ing effort of genius before she bids a final 
adieu to her Alma Mater. Confess now ! ” 
exclaimed the secretary. 

“ I cannot tell a lie, even to win fame, and 
I have no hatchet to back me up,” Leslie re- 
joined, laughingly. 

“ Well — it’s good and it goes in. Its 
freshness is a godsend. Our poets have fallen 
into a rut, or else they are working to win the 
prize. It smacks of groves, long since de- 
serted by simple-minded lovers, and turned 
into factories or oil refineries where Strephon 
gets soiled and coarse. Is it original? De- 
ceive me at your peril.” 

“I saw it cast and recast; I hammered at 
the poet until she brought it into shape; and 
it is from a freshman.” 

“ Oh, I can guess! The girl with the long 
light curls, tied up gracefully, who always 
looks as if she was posing. I heard her talk- 
ing one day about the impalpable, the in- 
tangible, and what not. She never used a 
short word where a trisyllable could be made 
to do duty.” 



“ Blit this hasn’t a long word in it. The 
very simplicity is charming. You are sure 
you can answer for it, Leslie?” 

kk Ouite certain, since I saw it rewritten a 
time or two, and much changed.” 

“ I like that better. I haven't much faith 
in these things dashed off in a moment, un- 
less the writer has been shaped up by years 
of practice and experience. Thank you, Leslie, 
for your discovery. How everybody will be 
guessing. This month’s Miscellany has been 
the trial of my life. Only four more, three 
for real work, one may say.” 

“ O dear ! Think how soon some of us will 
be going different ways. College spoils you, 
after all. You get so used to cloistered shades 
— that sounds poetical, doesn’t it? And now, 
Leslie, before we get lugubrious, tell us about 
your discovery.” 

“It was Helen Grant’s, rather than mine; 
a Miss Shirley Chardavoyne, freshman, Vir- 
ginian, a slim, rather pretty girl, with large, 
dark, moving eyes, as if she implored you not 
to judge her too harshly.” 

“ Well, I suppose she is a genius. She isn’t 


much of a scholar, and is the trial of Miss 
Van Meter’s morning. I’ve seen her with 
Miss Grant.” 

“ Girls, when the maga. is out we must give 
her a little spread. I wonder if she will do 
anything else as good. Oh, do you remember 
Rose Harding, who wrote those curiously 
weird poems, and last year’s chief lauded her 
to the skies ? And then they found them more 
or less plagiarisms.’’ 

“ She came from a Western college. Per- 
haps she had done it there.” 

“ Well, we can be dismissed. The last 
pages may go to the printer's hands. Oh, 
compeers, I suppose some time in the future 
we will take out our old Miscellanies and give 
a sigh for the happy days together, forgetting 
the infelicities, the tears, and heart-breaks, the 
withering comments, the midnight headaches 
near the close of the year! I’d just as leave 
live it all over again. Vale! vale!” and she 
rose waving her hand. 

Leslie took the pleasant news to Helen. 
“ But you are not to say a word until she sees 
it in print. And she is to have a welcome in 



the charmed circle afterward. I wish she 
cared more for scholarship.” 

“ The sophomores insist that I should go on 
their sleigh-ride, and I have consented. I 
begged an invitation for her.” 

“ Go off and have a good time. Next year, 
you will be full of anxieties." 

“ If I should pass,” laughing. 

“ As you will, if you don't waste too much 
time. But one has a curious feeling when one 
faces the fact that it is all over.” 

There were three big sleighs, and the girls 
crowded in, sitting on the straw between the 
knees of those on the seats. It was a fine 
sunny afternoon with a crisp air. Great sheets 
of unbroken snow sparkled like diamond fields, 
as the last of the storm had been fine rain and 
sleet. They were merry enough, singing col- 
lege songs, and yet a strange pensiveness per- 
vaded Helen. This year was different; there 
was a greater intellectual seriousness, indi- 
vidual preference for qualities that attracted 
her, instead of a sort of general approval that 
she had considered a duty. She was almost 
sorry she had skipped a year. 



Tired and sleepy from the change of out-of- 
doors air to the drowsy warmth, she went 
straight to her room after chapel. There were 
several letters. She saved Willard Bell's 
until the last. Truth to tell, she felt a little 
piqued at his long silence. He often wrote 
two letters to her one, and she had waited 
some time. She had not wanted to invite him 
for Christmas. 

The letter was dated at New Orleans. The 
senior partner of the firm had been called 
thither to disentangle a matter in which there 
was a large amount of money, as well as tracts 
of real estate that had long been in litigation. 
Willard had been asked to go as secretary and 
stenographer, and he hoped before his return 
to get to Bermuda. The news from Daisy was 
not encouraging. There had been some talk 
of German baths, but the doctor had forbidden 
any journeying about. They were delightfully 
situated, and had met some friends — indeed, 
there was coming and going continually. And 
Laurence Hollis had accepted a call to a pretty, 
old, new town, Vernon Park, where there was 
much culture and refinement, the beautiful old 


ways holding their own against the new. 
There was a select academy for girls, a fine 
library that had been donated by several pub- 
lic-spirited citizens, a stone church that had 
lately been renewed, but not spoiled, and a 
most cosy rectory. The clergyman of the last 
twenty years had insisted on retiring from 
active life. Mr. Hollis would go shortly after 
Christmas, was probably there now, and they 
would be delightfully situated. It was just 
the thing for Marjorie, the nice society where 
her accomplishments would not be allowed to 
rust. The mission station had been very well 
to try one’s prentice hand on, but Hollis could 
come up to finer heights. And they would not 
be very far from the Townes, who were re- 
joicing in a little son. 

Then there were pages about the old city 
that was still half-French and Spanish. It was 
such a bright friendly letter, so little about his 
feelings, but full of enjoyment, that Helen's 
heart some way warmed to him as it had not 
done in a long while. She must write to him; 
he could not tell when he should be back, and 
he might take a trip to Bermuda. Travelling 


about was one of the most inspiriting enjoy- 
ments. 

How the days flew by! Easter was begin- 
ning to be talked about. There were two con- 
certs with their practice, Easter Sunday music, 
and the glee club. They all said, “ Oh, we 
want your voice! ” And after Easter the out- 
of-door pleasures would begin. Helen was 
hungry for green and growing things ; the 
pines and firs and hemlocks seemed unsym- 
pathetic in their winter garb. But oh, there 
were tough exercises and problems to wrestle 
with, and girls to help out of the Slough of 
Despond ! She wondered sometimes why girls 
who had so much in their lives should get blue 
and despondent when they could study. Of 
course there were indifferent girls who were 
not anxious about their record and who never 
expected to be seniors. 

If she had written the verses herself, Helen 
could not have been so full of satisfaction as 
when she saw Shirley’s poem in print. One 
of the rules was that no name was attached 
to the articles. They were guessed at, and ad- 


mitted afterward, and every contributor had 
a right to claim her own. 

“ Why, this suggests some of the old Eng- 
lish poets,” said a senior. “ It is dainty and 
sweet, a perfect pastoral. Is it Ray Stannard, 
think ? Once in about three months, she has 
a delicious inspiration.” 

“ And she has sense enough not to cudgel 
her brain between whiles. Poets can’t be ham- 
mered out like gold leaf ; they get too awfully 
thin.” 

Helen took the paper to Miss Chardavoyne’s 
room and found her in tears over two returned 
exercises. One had the two black diagonal 
lines, and was good for nothing; the other 
began well, but two-thirds had to be gone 
over. 

“ Oh, I am so glad to see you!” She 
sprang up and flung her arms about Helen’s 
neck impulsively, laid her head in the arch be- 
tween cheek and shoulder, and cried, to the 
detriment of Helen’s fresh stock. 

“ I can’t do it ! I can’t ! Will I be sent 
home in disgrace, I wonder? And I’ve come 
to like it so. I’ve heard of high-up schools 


where they took parlor boarders; isn’t there 
any such thing in colleges? I tried and tried 
over those geometry problems until I felt my- 
self turning into all kinds of many-sided things 
and my brain nearly burst. Not one of them 
was right. Are there not some people who 
can’t learn certain things? And what use will 
they be to me? ” 

“ Do not take it so hard. Was nothing well 
done?” asked Helen, in a cool, tranquillizing 
tone. 

“ Oh, that about Greek art ! But you see, 
I really love that. And then the Anabasis, but 
I’d read the translations so much; only I’m 
not very expert in Greek writing. And French 
grammar was ‘ Passable. Go over again.’ 
I’m willing to stay in the freshman class, if 
I only squeeze through, but they were talk- 
ing last night about girls that had been 
dropped.” 

“ We will go over the geometry. It is hard 
for an unmathematical brain,” smiling. 

Shirley began to mop up her eyes. “ You’re 
my good angel, and yet you refuse the adora- 
tion I can offer. Even the Greek gods were 


not so cruel as that,” and a gleam of sunshine 
began to break over the child-face. 

“ Here is something that may comfort you. 
I think it a great compliment. I had one 
article in my freshman year, and one this De- 
cember. You may do quite as well.” 

She began with a puzzled look, glanced at 
Helen incredulously, then read on, and a radi- 
ance illumined her countenance, her lips quiv- 
ered, her eyes grew moist, it seemed, with both 
pain and pleasure struggling in them. 

“ They are my verses and they aren’t. It’s 
the poem you and Miss Brooks made me write. 
And I'd rather have mine to you, for that 
came from my very heart. You see, I don’t 
care what Strephon said to Phyllis; they’re 
not my people at all. They don’t touch my 
soul. Is it the soul that enjoys? Since that 
lesson in physiology about the heart and the 
circulation, you can’t have a bit of romance 
about it, or really believe any sentiment comes 
out of it. Science is just going to spoil every- 
thing beautiful in life,” she said, in a dissatis- 
fied, complaining tone. 




 

“ And you are not a bit grateful for this 
compliment?”  

“Oh! is it a compliment?” She looked 
bewildered. 

“ I suppose you never had anything printed 
before? ” 

“ Why, no ! I never dreamed any one 
would care until I could write something really 
splendid. I didn't suppose any one would 
want to print a little thing like that! It isn't 
as fine as that first one.” 

“ But you see general readers are not so 
much interested in personal admiration.” 

“ Why, I didn't care to have any one know 
it, but just you. That was the charm.” 

“ You are a little dear! ” exclaimed Helen, 
warmly, touched by the abnegation of self. 
“ Some day, if you cultivate your talent, you 
will understand all these necessary points that 
give delicate flavors. And when you have a 
lover, he may be glad of this poetic adoration.” 

“ If one could write Portuguese sonnets to 
him! But he would have to be Browning to 
inspire one.” 

What a curious compound she was. Was it 


real genius? Helen’s knowledge of geniuses
