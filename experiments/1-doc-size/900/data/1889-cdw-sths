for colonists as can be. Small bodies of them have been aided to make
settlements, but the trial is not very encouraging; very few of them
take to the new life. The Scotch crofters do better. They are accustomed
to labor and thrift, and are not a bad addition to the population. A
company under the management of Sir John Lister Kaye is making a larger
experiment. It has received sections from the Government and bought
contiguous sections from the railway, so as to have large blocks of land
on the road. A dozen settlements are projected. The company brings over
laborers and farmers, paying their expenses and wages for a year.
A large central house is built on each block, tools and cattle are
supplied, and the men are to begin the cultivation of the soil. At the
end of a year they may, if they choose, take up adjacent free Government
land and begin to make homes for themselves working meantime on the
company land, if they will. By this plan they are guaranteed support
for a year at least, and a chance to set up for themselves. The company
secures the breaking up of its land and a crop, and the nucleus of a
town. The further plan is to encourage farmers, with a capital of a
thousand dollars, to follow and settle in the neighborhood. There will
then be three ranks—the large company proprietors, the farmers with some
capital, and the laborers who are earning their capital. We saw some of
these settlements on the line that looked promising. About 150 settlers,
mostly men, arrived last fall, and with them were sent out English
tools and English cattle. The plan looks to making model communities, on
something of the old-world plan of proprietor, farmer, and laborer. It
would not work in the United States.

Another important colonization is that of Icelanders. These are settled
to the north-east of Winnipeg and in southern Manitoba. About 10,000
have already come over, and the movement has assumed such large
proportions that it threatens to depopulate Iceland. This is good
and intelligent material. Climate and soil are so superior to that of
Iceland that the emigrants are well content. They make good farmers, but
they are not so clannish as the Mennonites; many of them scatter about
in the towns as laborers.

Before we reached Medicine Hat, and beyond that place, we passed through
considerable alkaline country—little dried-up lakes looking like patches
of snow. There was an idea that this land was not fertile. The Canadian
Pacific Company have been making several experiments on the line of
model farms, which prove the contrary. As soon as the land is broken up
and the crust turned under, the soil becomes very fertile, and produces
excellent crops of wheat and vegetables.

Medicine Hat, on a branch of the South Saskatchewan, is a thriving town.
Here are a station and barracks of the Mounted Police, a picturesque
body of civil cavalry in blue pantaloons and red jackets. This body of
picked men, numbering about a thousand, and similar in functions to the
Guarda Civil of Spain, are scattered through the North-west Territory,
and are the Dominion police for keeping in order the Indians, and
settling disputes between the Indians and whites. The sergeants have
powers of police-justices, and the organization is altogether an
admirable one for the purpose, and has a fine esprit de corps.

Here we saw many Cree Indians, physically a creditable-looking race of
men and women, and picturesque in their gay blankets and red and
yellow paint daubed on the skin without the least attempt at shading or
artistic effect. A fair was going on, an exhibition of horses, cattle,
and vegetable and cereal products of the region. The vegetables
were large and of good quality. Delicate flowers were still blooming
(September 28th) untouched by frost in the gardens. These Crees are not
on a reservation. They cultivate the soil a little, but mainly support
themselves by gathering and selling buffalo bones, and well set-up and
polished horns of cattle, which they swear are buffalo. The women are
far from a degraded race in appearance, have good heads, high foreheads,
and are well-favored. As to morals, they are reputed not to equal the
Blackfeet.

The same day we reached Gleichen, about 2500 feet above the sea. The
land is rolling, and all good for grazing and the plough. This region
gets the “Chinook” wind. Ploughing is begun in April, sometimes in
March; in 1888 they ploughed in January. Flurries of snow may be
expected any time after October 1st, but frost is not so early as in
eastern Canada. A fine autumn is common, and fine, mild weather may
continue up to December. At Dun-more, the station before Medicine
Hat, we passed a branch railway running west to the great Lethbridge
coal-mines, and Dunmore Station is a large coal depot.

The morning at Gleichen was splendid; cool at sunrise, but no frost.
Here we had our first view of the Rockies, a long range of snow-peaks on
the horizon, 120 miles distant. There is an immense fascination in this
rolling country, the exhilarating air, and the magnificent mountains in
the distance. Here is the beginning of a reservation of the Blackfeet,
near 3000. They live here on the Bow River, and cultivate the soil to a
considerable extent, and have the benefit of a mission and two schools.
They are the best-looking race of Indians we have seen, and have most
self-respect.

We went over a rolling country to Calgary, at an altitude of 3388 feet,
a place of some 3000 inhabitants, and of the most distinction of all
between Brandon and Vancouver. On the way we passed two stations where
natural gas was used, the boring for which was only about 600 feet. The
country is underlaid with coal. Calgary is delightfully situated at the
junction of the Bow and Elbow rivers, rapid streams as clear as crystal,
with a greenish hue, on a small plateau, surrounded by low hills and
overlooked by the still distant snow-peaks. The town has many good
shops, several churches, two newspapers, and many fanciful cottages. We
drove several miles out on the McCloud trail, up a lovely valley, with
good farms, growing wheat and oats, and the splendid mountains in the
distance. The day was superb, the thermometer marking 70°. This is,
however, a ranch country, wheat being an uncertain crop, owing to
summer frosts. But some years, like 1888, are good for all grains
and vegetables. A few Saree Indians were loafing about here, inferior
savages. Much better are the Stony Indians, who are settled and work
the soil beyond Calgary, and are very well cared for by a Protestant
mission.

Some of the Indian tribes of Canada are self-supporting. This is true of
many of the Siwash and other west coast tribes, who live by fishing.
At Lytton, on the upper Fraser, I saw a village of the Siwash civilized
enough to live in houses, wear our dress, and earn their living by
working on the railway, fishing, etc. The Indians have done a good deal
of work on the railway, and many of them are still employed on it. The
coast Indians are a different race from the plains Indians, and have a
marked resemblance to the Chinese and Japanese. The polished carvings in
black slate of the Haida Indians bear a striking resemblance to archaic
Mexican work, and strengthen the theory that the coast Indians crossed
the straits from Asia, are related to the early occupiers of Arizona and
Mexico, and ought not to be classed with the North American Indian. The
Dominion has done very well by its Indians, of whom it has probably a
hundred thousand. It has tried to civilize them by means of schools,
missions, and farm instructors, and it has been pretty successful in
keeping ardent spirits away from them. A large proportion of them are
still fed and clothed by the Government. It is doubtful if the plains
Indians will ever be industrious. The Indian fund from the sale of their
lands has accumulated to $3,000,000. There are 140 teachers and
4000 pupils in school. In 1885 the total expenditure on the Indian
population, beyond that provided by the Indian fund, was $1,109,604, of
which $478,038 was expended for provisions for destitute Indians.

At Cochrane’s we were getting well into the hills. Here is a large horse
and sheep ranch and a very extensive range. North and south along the
foot-hills is fine grazing and ranging country. We enter the mountains
by the Bow River Valley, and plunge at once into splendid scenery, bare
mountains rising on both sides in sharp, varied, and fantastic peaks,
snow-dusted, and in lateral openings assemblages of giant summits
of rock and ice. The change from the rolling prairie was magical. At
Mountain House the Three Sisters were very impressive. Late in the
afternoon we came to Banff.

Banff will have a unique reputation among the resorts of the world. If
a judicious plan is formed and adhered to for the development of
its extraordinary beauties and grandeur, it will be second to few in
attractions. A considerable tract of wilderness about it is reserved
as a National Park, and the whole ought to be developed by some master
landscape expert. It is in the power of the Government and of the
Canadian Pacific Company to so manage its already famous curative hot
sulphur springs as to make Banff the resort of invalids as well as
pleasure-seekers the year round. This is to be done not simply by
established good bathing-places, but by regulations and restrictions
such as give to the German baths their virtue.

The Banff Hotel, unsurpassed in situation, amid magnificent mountains,
is large, picturesque, many gabled and windowed, and thoroughly
comfortable. It looks down upon the meeting of the Bow and the Spray,
which spread in a pretty valley closed by a range of snow-peaks. To
right and left rise mountains of savage rock ten thousand feet high. The
whole scene has all the elements of beauty and grandeur. The place
is attractive for its climate, its baths, and excellent hunting and
fishing.

For two days, travelling only by day, passing the Rockies, the Selkirks,
and the Gold range, we were kept in a state of intense excitement, in
a constant exclamation of wonder and delight. I would advise no one
to attempt to take it in the time we did. Nobody could sit through
Beethoven’s nine symphonies played continuously. I have no doubt that
when carriage-roads and foot-paths are made into the mountain recesses,
as they will be, and little hotels are established in the valleys and in
the passes and advantageous sites, as in Switzerland, this region will
rival the Alpine resorts. I can speak of two or three things only.

The highest point on the line is the station at Mount Stephen, 5296
feet above the sea. The mountain, a bald mass of rock in a rounded cone,
rises about 8000 feet above this. As we moved away from it the mountain
was hidden by a huge wooded intervening mountain. The train was speeding
rapidly on the down grade, carrying us away from the base, and we stood
upon the rear platform watching the apparent recession of the great
mass, when suddenly, and yet deliberately, the vast white bulk of Mount
Stephen began to rise over the intervening summit in the blue sky,
lifting itself up by a steady motion while one could count twenty,
until its magnificence stood revealed. It was like a transformation in
a theatre, only the curtain here was lowered instead of raised. The
surprise was almost too much for the nerves; the whole company was
awe-stricken. It is too much to say that the mountain “shot up;” it rose
with conscious grandeur and power. The effect, of course, depends much
upon the speed of the train. I have never seen anything to compare with
it for awakening the emotion of surprise and wonder.

The station of Field, just beyond Mount Stephen, where there is a
charming hotel, is in the midst of wonderful mountain and glacier
scenery, and would be a delightful place for rest. From there the
descent down the canon of Kickinghorse River, along the edge of
precipices, among the snow-monarchs, is very exciting. At Golden we come
to the valley of the Columbia River and in view of the Selkirks. The
river is navigable about a hundred miles above Golden, and this is the
way to the mining district of the Kootenay Valley. The region abounds
in gold and silver. The broad Columbia runs north here until it breaks
through the Selkirks, and then turns southward on the west side of that
range.

The railway follows down the river, between the splendid ranges of the
Selkirks and the Rockies, to the mouth of the Beaver, and then ascends
its narrow gorge. I am not sure but that the scenery of the Selkirks
is finer than that of the Rockies. One is bewildered by the illimitable
noble snow-peaks and great glaciers. At Glacier House is another
excellent hotel. In savage grandeur, nobility of mountain-peaks,
snow-ranges, and extent of glacier it rivals anything in Switzerland.
The glacier, only one arm of which is seen from the road, is, I believe,
larger than any in Switzerland. There are some thirteen miles of flowing
ice; but the monster lies up in the mountains, like a great octopus,
with many giant arms. The branch which we saw, overlooked by the
striking snow-cone of Sir Donald, some two and a half miles from the
hotel, is immense in thickness and breadth, and seems to pour out of the
sky. Recent measurements show that it is moving at the rate of twenty
inches in twenty-four hours—about the rate of progress of the Mer de
Glace. In the midst of the main body, higher up, is an isolated mountain
of pure ice three hundred feet high and nearly a quarter of a mile in
length. These mountains are the home of the mountain sheep.

From this amphitheatre of giant peaks, snow, and glaciers we drop by
marvellous loops—wonderful engineering, four apparently different tracks
in sight at one time—down to the valley of the Illicilliweat, the lower
part of which is fertile, and blooming with irrigated farms. We pass a
cluster of four lovely-lakes, and coast around the great Shuswap Lake,
which is fifty miles long. But the traveller is not out of excitement.
The ride down the Thompson and Fraser canons is as amazing almost as
anything on the line. At Spence’s Bridge we come to the old Government
road to the Cariboo gold-mines, three hundred miles above. This
region has been for a long time a scene of activity in mining and
salmon-fishing. It may be said generally of the Coast or Gold range
that its riches have yet to be developed. The villages all along these
mountain slopes and valleys are waiting for this development.

The city of Vancouver, only two years old since the beginnings of a town
were devoured by fire, is already an interesting place of seven to
eight thousand inhabitants, fast building up, and with many substantial
granite and brick buildings, and spreading over a large area. It lies
upon a high point of land between Burrard Inlet on the north and the
north arm of the Fraser River. The inner harbor is deep and spacious.
Burrard Inlet entrance is narrow but deep, and opens into English Bay,
which opens into Georgia Sound, that separates the island of Vancouver,
three hundred miles long, from the main-land. The round headland south
of the entrance is set apart for a public park, called now Stanley Park,
and is being improved with excellent driving-roads, which give charming
views. It is a tangled wilderness of nearly one thousand acres. So
dense is the undergrowth, in this moist air, of vines, ferns, and small
shrubs, that it looks like a tropical thicket. But in the midst of it
are gigantic Douglas firs and a few noble cedars. One veteran cedar,
partly decayed at the top, measured fifty-six feet in circumference, and
another, in full vigor and of gigantic height, over thirty-nine feet.
The hotel of the Canadian Pacific Company, a beautiful building in
modern style, is, in point of comfort, elegance of appointment, abundant
table, and service, not excelled by any in Canada, equalled by few
anywhere.

Vancouver would be a very busy and promising city merely as the railway
terminus and the shipping-point for Japan and China and the east
generally. But it has other resources of growth. There is a very
good country back of it, and south of it all the way into Washington
Territory. New Westminster, twelve miles south, is a place of importance
for fish and lumber. The immensely fertile alluvial bottoms of the
Fraser, which now overflows its banks, will some day be diked, and
become exceedingly valuable. Its relations to Washington Territory are
already close. The very thriving city of Seattle, having a disagreement
with the North Pacific and its rival, Tacoma, sends and receives most of
its freight and passengers via Vancouver, and is already pushing forward
a railway to that point. It is also building to Spokane Falls, expecting
some time to be met by an extension of the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and
Manitoba from the Great Falls of the Missouri. I found that many of the
emigrants in the loaded trains that we travelled with or that passed
us were bound to Washington Territory. It is an acknowledged fact that
there is a constant “leakage” of emigrants, who had apparently promised
to tarry in Canada, into United States territories. Some of them,
disappointed of the easy wealth expected, no doubt return; but the name
of “republic” seems to have an attraction for Old World people when they
are once set adrift.

We took steamer one afternoon for a five hours sail to Victoria. A part
of the way is among beautiful wooded islands. Once out in the open,
we had a view of our “native land,” and prominent in it the dim,
cloud-like, gigantic peak of Mount Baker. Before we passed the islands
we were entertained by a rare show of right-whales. A school of them a
couple of weeks before had come down through Behring Strait, and pursued
a shoal of fish into this landlocked bay. There must have been as
many as fifty of the monsters in sight, spouting up slender fountains,
lifting their huge bulk out of water, and diving, with their bifurcated
tails waving in the air. They played about like porpoises, apparently
only for our entertainment.

Victoria, so long isolated, is the most English part of Canada. The town
itself does not want solidity and wealth, but it is stationary, and, the
Canadians elsewhere think, slow. It was the dry and dusty time of the
year. The environs are broken with inlets, hilly and picturesque; there
are many pretty cottages and country places in the suburbs; and one
visits with interest the Eskimalt naval station, and the elevated Park,
which has a coble coast view. The very mild climate is favorable for
grapes and apples. The summer is delightful; the winter damp, and
constantly rainy. And this may be said of all this coast. Of the
thirteen thousand population six thousand are Chinese, and they form
in the city a dense, insoluble, unassimilating mass. Victoria has one
railway, that to the prosperous Nanaimo coal-mines. The island has
abundance of coal, some copper, and timber. But Vancouver has taken
away from Victoria all its importance as a port. The Government and
Parliament buildings are detached, but pleasant and commodious edifices.
There is a decorous British air about everything. Throughout British
Columbia the judges and the lawyers wear the gown and band and the
horse-hair wig. In an evening trial for murder which I attended in
a dingy upper chamber of the Kamloops court-house, lighted only by
kerosene lamps, the wigs and gowns of judge and attorneys lent, I
confess, a dignity to the administration of justice which the kerosene
lamps could not have given. In one of the Government buildings is
a capital museum of natural history and geology. The educational
department is vigorous and effective, and I find in the bulky report
evidence of most intelligent management of the schools.

It is only by traversing the long distance to this coast, and seeing the
activity here, that one can appreciate the importance to Canada and to
the British Empire of the Canadian Pacific Railway as a bond of unity,
a developer of resources, and a world’s highway. The out-going steamers
were crowded with passengers and laden with freight. We met on the way
two solid trains, of twenty cars each, full of tea. When the new swift
steamers are put on, which are already heavily subsidized by both the
English and the Canadian governments, the traffic in passengers and
goods must increase. What effect the possession of such a certain line
of communication with her Oriental domains will have upon the English
willingness to surrender Canada either to complete independence or to a
union with the United States, any political prophet can estimate.

It must be added that the Canadian Pacific Company are doing everything
to make this highway popular as well as profitable. Construction and
management show English regard for comfort and safety and order. It is
one of the most agreeable lines to travel over I am acquainted with.
Most of it is well built, and defects are being energetically removed.
The “Colonist” cars are clean and convenient. The first class carriages
are luxurious. The dining-room cars are uniformly well kept, the company
hotels are exceptionally excellent; and from the railway servants one
meets with civility and attention.




III.

I had been told that the Canadians are second-hand Englishmen. No
estimate could convey a more erroneous impression. A portion of the
people have strong English traditions and loyalties to institutions, but
in manner and in expectations the Canadians are scarcely more English
than the people of the United States; they have their own colonial
development, and one can mark already with tolerable distinctness a
Canadian type which is neither English nor American. This is noticeable
especially in the women. The Canadian girl resembles the American in
escape from a purely conventional restraint and in self-reliance,
and she has, like the English, a well-modulated voice and distinct
articulation. In the cities, also, she has taste in dress and a certain
style which we think belongs to the New World. In features and action
a certain modification has gone on, due partly to climate and partly to
greater social independence. It is unnecessary to make comparisons, and
I only note that there is a Canadian type of woman.

But there is great variety in Canada, and in fact a remarkable racial
diversity. The man of Nova Scotia is not at all the man of British
Columbia or Manitoba. The Scotch in old Canada have made a distinct
impression in features and speech. And it may be said generally in
eastern Canada that the Scotch element is a leading and conspicuous one
in the vigor and push of enterprise and the accumulation of fortune.
The Canadian men, as one sees them in official life, at the clubs, in
business, are markedly a vigorous, stalwart race, well made, of good
stature, and not seldom handsome. This physical prosperity needs to be
remembered when we consider the rigorous climate and the long winters;
these seem to have at least one advantage—that of breeding virile men.
The Canadians generally are fond of out-door sports and athletic games,
of fishing and hunting, and they give more time to such recreations
than we do. They are a little less driven by the business goad. Abundant
animal spirits tend to make men good-natured and little quarrelsome. The
Canadians would make good soldiers. There was a time when the drinking
habit pervaded very much in Canada, and there are still places where
they do not put water enough in their grog, but temperance reform has
taken as strong a hold there as it has in the United States.

The feeling about the English is illustrated by the statement that there
is not more aping of English ways in Montreal and Toronto clubs and
social life than in New York, and that the English superciliousness, or
condescension as to colonists, the ultra-English manner, is ridiculed
in Canada, and resented with even more warmth than in the United States.
The amusing stories of English presumption upon hospitality are current
in Canada as well as on this side. All this is not inconsistent with
pride in the empire, loyalty to its traditions and institutions, and
even a considerable willingness (for human nature is pretty much alike
everywhere) to accept decorative titles. But the underlying fact is that
there is a distinct feeling of nationality, and it is increasing.

There is not anywhere so great a contrast between neighboring cities as
between Quebec, Montreal, and Toronto. Quebec is mediæval, Toronto is
modern, Montreal is in a conflict between the two conditions. As the
travelling world knows, they are all interesting cities, and have
peculiar attractions. Quebec is French, more decidedly so than Toronto
is English, and in Montreal the French have a large numerical majority
and complete political control. In the Canadian cities generally
municipal affairs are pretty much divorced from general party politics,
greatly to the advantage of good city government.

Montreal has most wealth, and from its splendid geographical position it
is the railway centre, and has the business and commercial primacy. It
has grown rapidly from a population of 140,000 in 1881 to a population
of over 200,000—estimated, with its suburbs, at 250,000. Were it part of
my plan to describe these cities, I should need much space to devote
to the finest public buildings and public institutions of Montreal, the
handsome streets in the Protestant quarter, with their solid, tasteful,
and often elegant residences, the many churches, and the almost
unequalled possession of the Mountain as a park and resort, where one
has the most striking and varied prospects in the world. Montreal, being
a part of the province of Quebec, is not only under provincial control
of the government at Quebec, but it is ruled by the same French party
in the city, and there is the complaint always found where the poorer
majority taxes the richer and more enterprising minority out of
proportion to the benefits the latter receives. Various occasions
have produced something like race conflicts in the city, and there
are prophesies of more serious ones in the strife for ascendency. The
seriousness of this to the minority lies in the fact that the French
race is more prolific than any other in the province.

Perhaps nothing will surprise the visitor more than the persistence of
the French type in Canada, and naturally its aggressiveness. Guaranteed
their religion, laws, and language, the French have not only failed to
assimilate, but have had hopes—maybe still have—of making Canada French.
The French “national” party means simply a French consolidation, and has
no relation to the “nationalism” of Sir John Macdonald. So far as the
Church and the French politicians are concerned, the effort is to
keep the French solid as a political force, and whether the French are
Liberal or Conservative, this is the underlying thought. The province of
Quebec is Liberal, but the liberalism is of a different hue from that of
Ontario. The French recognize the truth that language is so integral
a part of a people’s growth that the individuality of a people depends
upon maintaining it. The French have escaped absorption in Canada mainly
by loyalty to their native tongue, aided by the concession to them
of their civil laws and their religious privileges. They owe this to
William Pitt. I quote from a contributed essay in the Toronto Week about
three years ago: “Up to 1791 the small French population of Canada was
in a position to be converted into an English colony with traces of
French sentiment and language, which would have slowly disappeared. But
at that date William Pitt the younger brought into the House of Commons
two Quebec Acts, which constituted two provinces—Lower Canada, with a
full provision of French laws, language, and institutions; Upper Canada,
with a reproduction of English laws and social system. During the debate
Pitt declared on the floor of the House that his purpose was to create
two colonies distinct from and jealous of each other, so as to guard
against a repetition of the late unhappy rebellion which had separated
the thirteen colonies from the empire.”

The French have always been loyal to the English connection under all
temptations, for these guarantees have been continued, which could
scarcely be expected from any other power, and certainly not in a
legislative union of the Canadian provinces. In literature and sentiment
the connection is with France; in religion, with Rome; in politics
England has been the guarantee of both. There will be no prevailing
sentiment in favor of annexation to the United States so long as
the Church retains its authority, nor would it be favored by the
accomplished politicians so long as they can use the solid French mass
as a political force.

The relegation of the subject of education entirely to the provinces
is an element in the persistence of the French type in the province
of Quebec, in the same way that it strengthens the Protestant cause
in Ontario. In the province of Quebec all the public schools are Roman
Catholic, and the separate schools are of other sects. In the council of
public instruction the Catholics, of course, have a large majority, but
the public schools are managed by a Catholic committee and the others
by a Protestant committee. In the academies, model and high schools,
subsidized by the Government, those having Protestant teachers are
insignificant in number, and there are very few Protestants in Catholic
schools, and very few Catholics in Protestant schools; the same is true
of the schools of this class not subsidized. The bulky report of the
superintendent of public instruction of the province of Quebec (which is
translated into English) shows a vigorous and intelligent attention
to education. The general statistics give the number of pupils in the
province as 219,403 Roman Catholics (the term always used in the report)
and 37,484 Protestants. In the elementary schools there are 143,848
Roman Catholics and 30,401 Protestants. Of the ecclesiastical teachers,
808 are Roman Catholics and 8 Protestants; of the certificated lay
teachers, 250 are Roman Catholic and 105 Protestant; the proportion
of schools is four to one. It must be kept in mind that in the French
schools it is French literature that is cultivated. In the Laval
University, at Quebec, English literature is as purely an ornamental
study as French literature would be in Yale. The Laval University, which
has a branch in Montreal, is a strong institution, with departments of
divinity, law, medicine, and the arts, 80 professors, and 575
students. The institution has a vast pile of buildings, one of the most
conspicuous objects in a view of the city. Besides spacious lecture,
assembly rooms, and laboratories, it has extensive collections in
geology, mineralogy, botany, ethnology, zoology, coins, a library
of 100,000 volumes, in which theology is well represented, but which
contains a large collection of works on Canada, including valuable
manuscripts, the original MS. of the Journal des Jésuites, and the most
complete set of the Relation des Jésuites existing in America. It has
also a gallery of paintings, chiefly valuable for its portraits.

Of the 62,000 population of Quebec City, by the census of 1881, not over
6000 were Protestants. By the same census Montreal had 140,747, of whom
78,684 were French, and 28,995 of Irish origin. The Roman Catholics
numbered 103,579. I believe the proportion has not much changed with the
considerable growth in seven years.

One is struck, in looking at the religious statistics of Canada, by
the fact that the Church of England has not the primacy, and that the
so-called independent sects have a position they have not in England.
In the total population of 4,324,810, given by the census of 1881,
the Protestants were put down at 2,436,554 and the Roman Catholics at
1,791,982. The larger of the Protestant denominations were, Methodists,
742,981; Presbyterians, 676,165; Church of England, 574,818; Baptists,
296,525. Taking as a specimen of the north-west the province of
Manitoba, census of 1886, we get these statistics of the larger sects:
Presbyterians, 28,406; Church of England, 23,206; Methodists, 18,648;
Roman Catholics, 14,651; Mennonites, 9112; Baptists, 3296; Lutherans,
3131.

Some statistics of general education in the Dominion show the popular
interest in the matter. In 1885 the total number of pupils in the
Dominion, in public and private schools, was 908,193, and the average
attendance was 555,404. The total expenditure of the year, not including
school buildings, was $9,310,745, and the value of school lands,
buildings, and furniture was $25,000,000. Yet in the province of Quebec,
out of the total expenditure of $3,102,410, only $353,077 was granted by
the provincial Legislature. And in Ontario, of the total of $3,904,797,
only $267,084 was granted by the Legislature.

The McGill University at Montreal, Sir William Dawson principal, is
a corporation organized under royal charter, which owes its original
endowment of land and money (valued at $120,000) to James McGill. It
receives small grants from the provincial and Dominion governments, but
mainly depends upon its own funds, which in 1885 stood at $791,000. It
has numerous endowed professorships and endowments for scholarships and
prizes; among them is the Donalda Endowment for the Higher Education of
Women (from Sir Donald A. Smith), by which a special course in separate
classes, by University professors, is maintained in the University
buildings for women. It has faculties of arts, applied sciences, law,
and medicine—the latter with one of the most complete anatomical museums
and one of the best selected libraries on the continent. It has several
colleges affiliated with it for the purpose of conferring
University degrees, a model school, and four theological colleges, a
Congregational, a Presbyterian, an Episcopalian, and a Wesleyan, the
students in which may supplement their own courses in the University.
The professors and students wear the University cap and gown, and
morning prayers are read to a voluntary attendance. The Redpath Museum,
of geology, mineralogy, zoology, and ethnology, has a distinction
among museums not only for the size of the collection, but for splendid
arrangement and classification. The well-selected library numbers about
30,000 volumes. The whole University is a vigorous educational centre,
and its well-planted grounds and fine buildings are an ornament to the
city.

Returning to the French element, its influence is not only felt in the
province of Quebec, but in the Dominion. The laws of the Dominion and
the proceedings are published in French and English; the debates in
the Dominion Parliament are conducted indifferently in both languages,
although it is observed that as the five years of any Parliament go on
English is more and more used by the members, for the French are more
likely to learn English than the English are to learn French. Of course
the Quebec Parliament is even more distinctly French. And the power of
the Roman Catholic Church is pretty much co-extensive with the language.
The system of tithes is legal in provincial law, and tithes can be
collected of all Roman Catholics by law. The Church has also what is
called the fabrique system; that is, a method of raising contributions
from any district for churches, priests’ houses, and conventual
buildings and schools. The tithes and the fabrique assessments make a
heavy burden on the peasants. The traveller down the St. Lawrence sees
how the interests of religion are emphasized in the large churches
raised in the midst of humble villages, and in the great Church
establishments of charity and instruction. It is said that the farmers
attempted to escape the tithe on cereals by changing to the cultivation
of pease, but the Church then decided that pease were cereals. There is
no doubt that the French population are devout, and that they support
the Church in proportion to their devotion, and that much which seems
to the Protestants extortion on the part of the Church is a voluntary
contribution. Still the fact remains that the burden is heavy on land
that is too cold for the highest productiveness. The desire to better
themselves in wages, and perhaps to escape burdens, sends a great many
French to New England. Some of them earn money, and return to settle in
the land that is dear by tradition and a thousand associations. Many do
not return, and I suppose there are over three-quarters of a million
of French Canadians now in New England. They go to better themselves,
exactly as New Englanders leave their homes for more productive farms in
the West. The Church, of course, does not encourage this emigration,
but does encourage the acquisition of lands in Ontario or elsewhere
in Canada. And there has been recently a marked increase of French
in Ontario—so marked that the French representation in the Ontario
Parliament will be increased probably by three members in the next
election. There are many people in Canada who are seriously alarmed at
this increase of the French and of the Roman Catholic power. Others look
upon this fear as idle, and say that immigration is sure to make the
Protestant element overwhelming. It is to be noted also that Ontario
furnishes Protestant emigrants to the United States in large numbers. It
may be that the interchange of ideas caused by the French emigration
to New England will be an important make-weight in favor of annexation.
Individuals, and even French newspapers, are found to advocate it. But
these are at present only surface indications. The political leaders,
the Church, and the mass of the people are fairly content with things as
they are, and with the provincial autonomy, although they resent federal
vetoes, and still make a “cry” of the Riel execution.

The French element in Canada may be considered from other points of
view. The contribution of romance and tradition is not an unimportant
one in any nation. The French in Canada have never broken with their
past, as the French in France have. There is a great charm about
Quebec—its language, its social life, the military remains of the last
century. It is a Protestant writer who speaks of the volume and
wealth of the French Canadian literature as too little known to
English-speaking Canada. And it is true that literary men have not
realized the richness of the French material, nor the work accomplished
by French writers in history, poetry, essays, and romances. Quebec
itself is at a commercial stand-still, but its uniquely beautiful
situation, its history, and the projection of mediævalism into existing
institutions make it one of the most interesting places to the tourist
on the continent. The conspicuous, noble, and commodious Parliament
building is almost the only one of consequence that speaks of the modern
spirit. It was the remark of a high Church dignitary that the object of
the French in Canada was the promotion of religion, and the object
of the English, commerce. We cannot overlook this attitude against
materialism. In the French schools and universities religion is not
divorced from education. And even in the highest education, where modern
science has a large place, what we may call the literary side is very
much emphasized. Indeed, the French students are rather inclined to
rhetoric, and in public life the French are distinguished for the
graces and charm of oratory. It may be true, as charged, that the public
schools of Quebec province, especially in the country, giving special
attention to the interest the Church regards as the highest, do little
to remove the ignorance of the French peasant. It is our belief that
the best Christianity is the most intelligent. Yet there is matter for
consideration with all thoughtful men what sort of society we shall
ultimately have in States where the common schools have neither
religious nor ethical teaching.

Ottawa is a creation of the Federal Government as distinctly as
‘Washington is. The lumber-mills on the Chaudière Falls necessitate a
considerable town here, for this industry assumes gigantic proportions,
but the beauty and attraction of the city are due to the concentration
here of political interest. The situation on the bluffs of the Ottawa
River is commanding, and gives fine opportunity for architectural
display. The group of Government buildings is surpassingly fine. The
Parliament House and the department buildings on three sides of a square
are exceedingly effective in color and in the perfection of Gothic
details, especially in the noble towers. There are few groups of
buildings anywhere so pleasing to the eye, or that appeal more strongly
to one’s sense of dignity and beauty. The library attached to the
Parliament House in the rear, a rotunda in form, has a picturesque
exterior, and the interior is exceedingly beautiful and effective.
The library, though mainly for Parliamentary uses, is rich in Canadian
history, and well up in polite literature. It contains about 90,000
volumes. In the Parliament building, which contains the two fine
legislative Chambers, there are residence apartments for the Speakers
of the Senate and of the House of Commons and their families, where
entertainments are given during the session. The opening of Parliament
is an imposing and brilliant occasion, graced by the presence of the
Governor-general, who is supposed to visit the Chambers at no other
time in the session. Ottawa is very gay during the session, society and
politics mingling as in London, and the English habit of night sessions
adds a good deal to the excitement and brilliancy of the Parliamentary
proceedings.

The growth of the Government business and of official life has made
necessary the addition of a third department building, and the new one,
departing from the Gothic style, is very solid and tasteful. There are
thirteen members of the Privy Council with portfolios, and the volume of
public business is attested by the increase of department officials.

I believe there are about 1500 men attached to the civil service in
Ottawa. It will be seen at once that the Federal Government, which
seemed in a manner superimposed upon the provincial governments, has
taken on large proportions, and that there is in Ottawa and throughout
the Dominion in federal officials and offices a strengthening vested
interest in the continuance of the present form of government. The
capital itself, with its investment in buildings, is a conservator of
the state of things as they are. The Cabinet has many able men, men who
would take a leading rank as parliamentarians in the English Commons,
and the Opposition benches in the House furnish a good quota of the
same material. The power of the premier is a fact as recognizable as
in England. For many years Sir John A. Macdonald has been virtually the
ruler of Canada. He has had the ability and skill to keep his party
in power, while all the provinces have remained or become Liberal. I
believe his continuance is due to his devotion to the national idea, to
the development of the country, to bold measures—like the urgency of the
Canadian Pacific Railway construction—for binding the provinces together
and promoting commercial activity. Canada is proud of this, even while
it counts its debt. Sir John is worshipped by his party, especially by
the younger men, to whom he furnishes an ideal, as a statesman of bold
conceptions and courage. He is disliked as a politician as cordially by
the Opposition, who attribute to him the same policy of adventure that
was attributed to Beaconsfield. Personally he resembles that remarkable
man. Undoubtedly Sir John adds prudence to his knowledge of men, and his
habit of never crossing a stream till he gets to it has gained him the
sobriquet of “Old To-morrow.” He is a man of the world as well as a man
of affairs, with a wide and liberal literary taste.

The members of Government are well informed about the United States, and
attentive students of its politics. I am sure that, while they prefer
their system of responsible government, they have no sentiment but
friendliness to American institutions and people, nor any expectation
that any differences will not be adjusted in a manner satisfactory and
honorable to both. I happened to be in Canada during the fishery
and “retaliation” talk. There was no belief that the “retaliation”
threatened was anything more than a campaign measure; it may have
chilled the rapport for the moment, but there was literally no
excitement over it, and the opinion was general that retaliation as to
transportation would benefit the Canadian railways. The effect of the
moment was that importers made large foreign orders for goods to be sent
by Halifax that would otherwise have gone to United States ports. The
fishery question is not one that can be treated in the space at
our command. Naturally Canada sees it from its point of view. To a
considerable portion of the maritime provinces fishing means livelihood,
and the view is that if the United States shares in it we ought to
open our markets to the Canadian fishermen. Some, indeed, and these are
generally advocates of freer trade, think that our fishermen ought to
have the right of entering the Canadian harbors for bait and shipment
of their catch, and think also that Canada would derive an equal benefit
from this; but probably the general feeling is that these privileges
should be compensated by a United States market. The defence of the
treaty in the United States Senate debate was not the defence of the
Canadian Government in many particulars. For instance, it was said that
the “outrages” had been disowned as the acts of irresponsible men. The
Canadian defence was that the “outrages”—that is, the most conspicuous
of them which appeared in the debate—had been disproved in the
investigation. Several of them, which excited indignation in the United
States, were declared by a Cabinet minister to have no foundation in
fact, and after proof of the falsity of the allegations the complainants
were not again heard of. Of course it is known that no arrangement made
by England can hold that is not materially beneficial to Canada and the
United States; and I believe I state the best judgment of both
sides that the whole fishery question, in the hands of sensible
representatives of both countries, upon ascertained facts, could be
settled between Canada and the United States. Is it not natural that,
with England conducting the negotiation, Canada should appear as a
somewhat irresponsible litigating party bent on securing all that she
can get? But whatever the legal rights are, under treaties or the law of
nations, I am sure that the absurdity of making a casus belli of them
is as much felt in Canada as in the United States. And I believe the
Canadians understand that this attitude is consistent with a firm
maintenance of treaty or other rights by the United States as it is by
Canada.

The province of Ontario is an empire in itself. It is nearly as large
as France; it is larger by twenty-live thousand square miles than
the combined six New England States, with New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland. In its varied capacities it is the richest
province in Canada, and leaving out the forests and minerals and stony
wilderness between the Canadian Pacific and James Bay, it has an area
large enough for an empire, which compares favorably in climate and
fertility with the most prosperous States of our Union. The climate
of the lake region is milder than that of southern New York, and a
considerable part of it is easily productive of superior grapes, apples,
and other sorts of fruit. The average yield of wheat, per acre, both
fall and spring, for five years ending with 1886, was considerably above
that of our best grain-producing States, from Pennsylvania to those
farthest West. The same is true of oats. The comparison of barley
is still more favorable for Ontario, and the barley is of a superior
quality. On a carefully cultivated farm in York county, for this period,
the average was higher than the general in the province, being, of
wheat, 25 bushels to the acre; barley, 47 bushels; oats, 66 bushels;
pease, 32 bushels. It has no superior as a wool-producing and
cattle-raising country. Its waterpower is unexcelled; in minerals it is
as rich as it is in timber; every part of it has been made accessible to
market by railways and good highways, which have had liberal Government
aid; and its manufactures have been stimulated by a protective tariff.
Better than all this, it is the home of a very superior people. There
are no better anywhere. The original stock was good, the climate has
been favorable, the athletic habits have given them vigor and tone and
courage, and there prevails a robust, healthful moral condition. In any
company, in the clubs, in business houses, in professional circles, the
traveller is impressed with the physical development of the men, and
even on the streets of the chief towns with the uncommon number of women
who have beauty and that attractiveness which generally goes with good
taste in dress.

The original settlers of Ontario were 10,000 loyalists, who left New
England during and after our Revolutionary War. They went to Canada
impoverished, but they carried there moral and intellectual qualities
of a high order, the product of the best civilization of their day,
the best materials for making a State. I confess that I never could
rid myself of the school-boy idea that the terms “British redcoat”
and “enemy” were synonymous, and that a “Tory” was the worst character
Providence had ever permitted to live. But these people, who were
deported, or went voluntarily away for an idea, were among the best
material we had in stanch moral traits, intellectual leadership, social
position, and wealth; their crime was superior attachment to England,
and utter want of sympathy with the colonial cause, the cause of
“liberty” of the hour. It is to them, at any rate, that Ontario owes its
solid basis of character, vigor, and prosperity. I do not quarrel with
the pride of their descendants in the fact that their ancestors were
U. E. (United Empire) loyalists—a designation that still has a vital
meaning to them. No doubt they inherit the idea that the revolt was a
mistake, that the English connection is better as a form of government
than the republic, and some of them may still regard the “Yankees” as
their Tory ancestors did. It does not matter. In the development of
a century in a new world they are more like us than they are like
the English, except in a certain sentiment and in traditions, and in
adherence to English governmental ideas. I think I am not wrong in
saying that this conservative element in Ontario, or this aristocratical
element which believes that it can rule a people better than they
can rule themselves, was for a long time an anti-progressive and
anti-popular force. They did not give up their power readily—power,
however, which they were never accused of using for personal profit in
the way of money. But I suppose that the “rule of the best” is only held
today as a theory under popular suffrage in a responsible government.

The population of Ontario in 1886 was estimated at 1,819,026. For the
seven years from 1872—79 the gain was 250,782. For the seven years from
1879-86 the gain was only 145,459. These figures, which I take from the
statistics of Mr. Archibald Blue, secretary of the Ontario Bureau of
Industries, become still more significant when we consider that in the
second period of seven years the Government had spent more money in
developing the railways, in promoting immigration, and raised more money
by the protective tariff for the establishing of industries, than in the
first. The increase of population in the first period was 174 per cent.;
in the second, only 8 2/3 per cent. Mr. Blue also says that but for the
accession by immigration in the seven years 1879-86 the population
of the province in 1886 would have been 62,640 less than in 1879. The
natural increase, added to the immigration reported (208,000), should
have given an increase of 442,000. There was an increase of only
145,000. What became of the 297,000? They did not go to Manitoba—the
census shows that. “The lamentable truth is that we are growing men
for the United States.” That is, the province is at the cost of raising
thousands of citizens up to a productive age only to lose them by
emigration to the United States. Comparisons are also made with Ohio
and Michigan, showing in them a proportionally greater increase in
population, in acres of land under production, in manufactured products,
and in development of mineral wealth. And yet Ontario has as great
natural advantages as these neighboring States. The observation is
also made that in the six years 1873-79, a period of intense business
stringency, the country made decidedly greater progress than in the six
years 1879-85, “a period of revival and boom, and vast expenditure of
public money.” The reader will bear in mind that the repeal (caused
mainly by the increase of Canadian duties on American products) of the
reciprocity treaty in 1866 (under which an international trade had grown
to $70,000,000 annually) discouraged any annexation sentiment that may
have existed, aided the scheme of confederation, and seemed greatly to
stimulate Canadian manufactures, and the growth of interior and exterior
commerce.

We touch here not only political questions active in Canada, but
economic problems affecting both Canada and the United States. It is the
criticism of the Liberals upon the “development” policy, the protective
tariff, the subsidy policy of the Liberal-Conservative party now in
power, that a great show of activity is made without any real progress
either in wealth or population. To put it in a word, the Liberals want
unrestricted trade with the United States, with England, or with the
world—preferably with the United States. If this caused separation from
England they would accept the consequences with composure, but they
vehemently deny that they in any way favor annexation because they
desire free-trade. Pointing to the more rapid growth of the States of
the Union their advantage is said to consist in having free exchange of
commodities with sixty millions of people, spread over a continent.

As a matter of fact it seems plain that Ontario would benefit and have
a better development by sharing in this large circulation and exchange.
Would the State of New York be injured by the prosperity of Ontario?

Is it not benefited by the prosperity of its other neighbor,
Pennsylvania?

Toronto represents Ontario. It is its monetary, intellectual,
educational centre, and I may add that here, more than anywhere else
in Canada, the visitor is conscious of the complicated energy of a very
vigorous civilization. The city itself has grown rapidly—an increase
from 86,415 in 1881 to probably 170,000 in 1888—and it is growing as
rapidly as any city on the continent, according to the indications
of building, manufacturing, railway building, and the visible stir of
enterprise. It is a very handsome and agreeable city, pleasant for one
reason, because it covers a large area, and gives space for the
display of its fine buildings. I noticed especially the effect of noble
churches, occupying a square—ample grounds that give dignity to the
house of God. It extends along the lake about six miles, and runs back
about as far, laid out with regularity, and with the general effect
of being level, but the outskirts have a good deal of irregularity and
picturesqueness. It has many broad, handsome streets and several fine
parks; High Park on the west is extensive, the University grounds (or
Queen’s Park) are beautiful—the new and imposing Parliament Buildings
are being erected in a part of its domain ceded for the purpose; and
the Island Park, the irregular strip of an island lying in front of the
city, suggests the Lido of Venice. I cannot pause upon details, but the
town has an air of elegance, of solidity, of prosperity. The well-filled
streets present an aspect of great business animation, which is seen
also in the shops, the newspapers, the clubs. It is a place of social
activity as well, of animation, of hospitality.

There are a few delightful old houses, which date back to the New
England loyalists, and give a certain flavor to the town.

If I were to make an accurate picture of Toronto it would appear as one
of the most orderly, well-governed, moral, highly civilized towns on
the continent—in fact, almost unique in the active elements of a high
Christian civilization. The notable fact is that the concentration here
of business enterprise is equalled by the concentration of religious and
educational activity.

The Christian religion is fundamental in the educational system. In this
province the public schools are Protestant, the separate schools Roman
Catholic, and the Bible has never been driven from the schools. The
result as to positive and not passive religious instruction has not
been arrived at without agitation. The mandatory regulations of the
provincial Assembly are these: Every public and high school shall be
opened daily with the Lord’s Prayer, and closed with the reading of
the Scriptures and the Lord’s Prayer, or the prayer authorized by
the Department of Education. The Scriptures shall be read daily and
