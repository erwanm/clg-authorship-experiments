'They're awful, up this way, to Bear Hill. I say, Miss 
Starling, how do you s'pose those people lives, in that village ? ' 

' How do they ? I don't know.' 

' Beats me ! they don't raise nothin', and they don't 
kill nothin', 'thout it's other folks's ; and what they live on 
I would jest like to know. Mother, she thinks a minister 
had ought to go and settle down among 'em ; but I tell her 
I'd like to see what a sherifFd do, fust. They don't live 
in no reg'lar good way, that's a fact.' 

' Poor people ! ' said Diana. ' They don't even know 
enough to pick blackberries.' 

' They hadn't no need to be so poor, ef they would 
work,' said the young man. ' But I s'pose you've got a 
kind word for every one, ha'n't you, Miss Starling ? ' 

' Diany,' said the voice of Joe Bartlett, who was push- 
ing his way towards her through the bushes, ' Diany ! 
Here you be ! Here's your mother lookin' for ye. Got all 
you want ? It's gettin' time to make tracks for hum. The 
sun's consid'able low.' 

' I'm ready, Joe.' 

' Give me one o' them pails, then, and we'll try ef we 
kin git through these pesky bushes. I vow ! I wouldn't 
like to take Bear Hill for a farm, not on a long lease.' 

They pushed and fought their way in the thicket for a 
long distance, till, as Joe remarked, they had surveyed the 
hill pretty well ; Diana conscious all the time that Mr. 
Knowlton and Gertrude were following in their wake. That 
was near enough. She liked it so. She liked it even that 
in the crowd and the bustle of packing and hitching horses 
and getting seated, there was no chance for more than a 
far-off nod and wave of the hand from the Elmfield parly. 
They drove off first this time. And Diana followed at a 




little distance, driving Prince ; Mrs. Statling declaring herself " tuckered out." 

There was no sense of weariness on Diana. Never less 
in her life. She was glad the drive was so long; not because she was weary and wanted to rest, but because every 
nerve and sense seemed strung to a fine tension, so that 
everything that touched them sent waves of melody over 
her being. Truly the light was sweet that evening, for any 
eyes ; to Diana's vision the sunbeams were solid gold, 
though refined out of all sordidness, and earth was heaped 
up and brimming over with riches. The leaves of the trees 
on the hillsides sparkled in the new wealth of nature ; the 
air scintillated with it ; the water was full of it. Prince's 
hoofs trod in measure, and the wheels of the wagon moved 
rhythmically, and the evening breeze might have been the 
very spirit of harmony. The way was long, and before 
home was reached the light had faded and the sparkling 
was gone ; but even that was welcome to Diana. She 
was glad to have a veil fall, for a while, over the brightness, and hide even from herself the new world into which 
she had entered. She knew it was there, under the veil ; 
the knowledge was enough for the present. 



CHAPTER IX. 
MRS. STARLING'S OPINIONS. 

It was well dusk when Prince stopped under the elm 
tree. The sun had gone down behind the low distant hills, 
leaving a white glory in all that region of the heavens ; and 
shadows were settling upon the valleys. All household 
wants and proprieties were disarranged ; the thing to do 
was to bring up arrears as speedily as possible. To this 
Mrs. Starling and her daughter addressed themselves. The 
blackberries were put carefully away ; the table set ; supper cooked, for the men must have a warm supper ; and 
after supper and clearing up there came a lull. 

' If it warn't so late,' said Mrs. Starling, 'but it is too 
late, I'd go at those berries.' 

' Mother ! Not to-night.' 

' Well, no ; it's 'most too late, as I said ; and I am tired. 
I want to know if this is what folks call work or play? 
'cause if it's play, I'd rather work, for my part. I believe 
I'd sooner stand at the wash-tub.' 

'Than pick blackberries, mother ? ' 

' Well, yes,' said Mrs. Starling ; ' 'cause then I'd know 
when my work was done. If the sun hadn't gone down, 
we'd all be pickin' yet.' 

' I am sure, you could stop when you were tired, mother ; 
couldn't you ? ' 



 

' I never am tired, child, while I see my work before 
me ; don't you know that ? And it's a sin to let the ripe 
fruit go unpicked. I wonder what it grows in such a place 
for ! Who were you with all day ? ' 

' Different people.' 

' Did Will Flandin find you ? ' 

' Yes.' 

' He was in a takin' to know where you were. So I just 
gave him a bit of a notion.' 

' I don't see how you could know, mother ; I had been 
going so roundabout among the bushes. I don't know 
where I was, myself.' 

'When ever you don't know that, Diana, stop and find out.' 

Mrs. Starling was sitting before the stove in a resting 
attitude, with her feet stretched out towards it. Diana 
was busy with some odds and ends, but her mother's tone 
or was it her own consciousness ? made her suddenly 
stop and look towards her. Mrs. Starling did not see this, 
Diana being behind her. 

' Did it ever strike you that Will was sweet on you ? ' 
she went on. 

' Will Flandin, mother ? ' 

An inarticulate note of assent. 

Diana did not answer, and instead went on with what 
she had been doing. 

'Hey?' said Mrs. Starling. 

' I hope he'll get cured of it, mother, if he is.' 

' Why ? ' 

' I don't know why,' said Diana, half laughing, ' except 
that he had better be sweet on some one else.' 

' He's a nice fellow.' 

' Yes, I think he is ; as they go.' 

' And he'll be very well off, Diana.' 


' He's no match for me, then, mother ; for I am well 
off now.' 

'No, you ain't, child,' said Mrs. Starling. 'We have 
enough to live on, but that's all.' 

' What more does anybody want ? ' 

' You don't mean what you say, Diana ! ' cried her 
mother turning upon her. ' Don't you want to have pretty 
things, and a nice house, and furniture to suit you, and 
maybe servants to do your work ? I wonder who's particular, if you ain't ! Wouldn't you like a nice carriage ? ' 

' I like all these things well enough, mother ; but they 
are not the first thing.' 

' What is the first thing ? ' said Mrs. Starling shortly. 

' I should say, how I get them.' 

' Oh ! I thought you were going to say the man was 
the first thing. That's the usual lingo.' 

Diana was silent again. 

' Now you can have Will,' her mother went on ; ' and he 
would be my very choice for you, Diana.' 

Diana made no response. 

' He is smart ; and he is good-lookin' ; and he'll have a 
beautiful farm and a good deal of money ready laid up to 
begin with ; and he's the sort to make it more and not 
make it less. And his mother is a first-rate woman. It's 
one of the best families in all Pleasant Valley.' 

' I would rather not marry either of 'em,' said Diana, 
with a little half laugh again. ' You know, mother, there 
are a great many nice people in the world. I can't have 
all of 'em.' 

' Who were you with all the forenoon ? ' Mrs. Starling 
asked suddenly. 

' You went off and left me with the people from Elmfield. I was taking care of them.' 




' I saw you come out of the field with them. What a 
poppinjay that Masters girl is, to be sure ! and Mrs. 
what's her name ? the other, is not much better. Soft as 
oil, and as slippery. How on earth did they come to Bear 
Hill?' 

' I suppose they thought it would be fun,' Diana said 
with constrained voice. 

' Don't let anybody get sweet on you there, Diana Starling ; not if you know what is good for you.' 

' Where, mother ? ' 

' There. At Elmfield. Among the Knowlton folks.' 

' What's the matter with them ? ' Diana asked ; but not 
without a touch of amusement in her voice, which perhaps 
turned the edge of her mother's suspicion. She went on 
however energetically. 

' Poor and proud ! ' she said. ' Poor and proud. And 
that's about the meanest kind of a mixture there is. I 
don't mind if folks has something to go on why, airs come 
nat'ral to human nature ; I can forgive 'em anyhow, for I'm 
as proud as they be. But when they hairft anything and 
when they pile up their pretensions so high they can't carry 
'em steady for my part I'd rather keep out o' their way. 
They're no pleasure to me ; and if they think they're an 
honour, it's an opinion I don't share. Gertrude Masters 
ain't no better than a balloon; full of gas ; she hain't 
weight enough to keep her on her feet ; and Mrs. what's 
her name ? Genevy she's as smooth as an eel. And 
Evan is a monkey.' 

' Mother ! what makes you say so ? ' 

' Why don't he shave himself then, like other folks ? ' 

' Why mother, it is just the fashion in the army to wear 
a moustache.' 

' What business has he to be in the army ? He ought 


to be here helping his grandfather. I have no sort 'o patience with him.' 

' Mother, you know they sent him to the Military Academy ; of course he could not help being in the army. It is 
no fault of his.' 

' He could quit it, I suppose, if he wanted to. But he 
ain't that sort. He just likes to wear gold on his shoulders, 
and a stripe down his leg, and fancy buttons, and go with 
his coat flying all open to shew his white shirt. I think, 
when folks have a^pair of such broad shoulders, they're 
meant to do some work ; but he'll never do none. He'll 
please himself, and hold himself up high over them that 
does work. And he'll live to die poor. I. \von't have you 
take after such a fellow, Diana ; mind I won't. I won't 
have you settin' yourself up above your mother and despisin' the ways you was brought up to. And I want you to be 
mistress o' Will Flandin's house and lands and money ; 
and you can, if you're a mind to.' 

Diana was a little uncertain between laughing and crying, and thought best not to trust her voice. So they went 
up to their rooms and separated for the night. But all inclination to tears was shut out with the shutting of her 
door. Was not the moonlight streaming full and broad 
over all the fields, filling the whole world with quiet ra- 
diance ? So came down the clear quiet illumination of her 
happiness upon all Diana's soul. There was no disturbance ; there was no shadow ; there was no wavering, of 
that full flood of still ecstasy. All things not in harmony 
with it were hidden by it. That's the way with moonlight. 

And the daylight was sweeter. Early, Diana always 
saw it; in those prime hours of day when strength and 
freshness, and promise, and bright hope, are the speech and 
the eye-glance of nature. How much help the people lose, 




who lose all that. When the sun's first look at the mountains breaks into a smile ; when morning softly draws off 
the veil from the work there is to do ; when the stir of the 
breeze speaks courage or breathes kisses of sympathy ; 
and the clear blue sky seems waiting for the rounded and 
perfected day to finish its hours, now just beginning. Diana 
often saw it so ; she did not often stop so long at her window to look and listen, as she did this morning. It was a 
clear, calm, crisp morning, without a touch of frost, promising one of those mellow, golden, delicious days of September that are the very ripeness of the year ; just yet six 
o'clock held only the promise of it. Like her life ! But 
the daylight brought all the vigour of reality ; and last night 
was moonshine. Diana sat at her window a few minutes 
drinking it all in ; and then went to her dairy. 

Alas ! one's head may be in rare ether, and one's feet 
find bad walking spots at the same time. It wa-s Diana's 
experience at breakfast. 

' How are those pigs getting along, Josiah ? ' Mrs. Starling demanded. 

' Waell, I don' know,' was the somewhat unsatisfactory 
response. ' Guess likely the little one's gettin' ahead lately.' 

' He hadn't ought to ! ' said Mrs. Starling. ' What's 
the reason the others ain't gettin' ahead as fast as him ? ' 

' He's a different critter that's all,' said Josiah stolidly. ' He'll be the biggest.' 

' They're all fed alike ? ' 

' Fur's my part goes,' said Josiah ; ' but when it comes 
to the eatin' tell you ! that little feller'll put away consid'able more'n his share. That's how he's growd so.' 

' They are not any of 'em the size they ought to be, 
Josiah.' 



' We ain't feedin' 'em corn yet.' 

' But they are not as big as they were last year this 
time.' 

' Don't see how you'll help it,' said Josiah. ' I ain't 
done nothin' to 'em.' 

With which conclusion Mrs. Starling's ' help ' finished 
his breakfast and went off. 

' There ain't the hay there had ought to be, in the mows, 
neither,' Mrs. Starling went on to her daughter. ' I know 
there ain't ; not by tons. And there's no sort o' a crop 
o' rye. I wish to mercy, Diana, you'd do somethin'.' 

' Do what, mother ? ' Diana said gayly. ' You mean, 
you wish Josiah would do something.' 

' I know what I mean,' said Mrs. Starling, ' and I com- 
monly say it. That is, when I say anything. I dorft wish 
anything about Josiah. I've given up wishin'. He's an 
unaccountable boy. There's no dependin' on him. And 
the thing is, he clon't care. All he thinks on is his own 
victuals ; and so long's he has 'em, he don't care whether 
the rest of the world turns round or no.' 

' I suppose it's the way with most people, mother ; to 
care most for their own.' 

' But if I had hired myself to take care of other folks' 
things, I'd do it,' said Mrs. Starling. That ain't my way. 
Just see what I haven't done this morning already ! and 
he's made out to eat his breakfast and fodder his cattle. 
I've been out to the barn and had a good look at the hay 
mow and calculated the grain in the bins ; and seen to the 
pigs; and that was after I'd made my fire and ground my 
coffee and set the potatoes on to boil and got the table 
ready and the rooms swept out. Is that cream going to 
get churned to-day, Diana ? ' 

' No, mother.' 



 

'It's old enough.' 

' It is not ready, though.' 

' It ought to be. I tell you what, Diana, you raust set 
your cream pot in here o' nights ; the dairy's too cold.' 

' Warm enough yet, mother. Makes better butter.' 

' You don't get nigh so much, though. That last buttermilk was all thick with floatin' bits of butter ; and that's 
what I call wasteful.' 

' I call it good, though.' 

' There's where you make a mistake, Diana Starling ; 
and if you ever want to be anything but a poor woman, 
you've got to mend. It's, just those little holes in your 
pocket that let out the money ; a penny at a time, to be 
sure ; but by and by when you come to look for the dollars, 
you won't find 'em ; and you'll not know where they're 
gone. And you'll want 'em.' 

' Mother,' said Diana laughing, ' I can't feel afraid. 
We have never wanted 'em yet.' 

'You've been young, child. You will want 'em as you 
grow older. Marry Will Flandin, and you'll have 'em ; 
and you may churn your cream how you like. I tell you 
what, Diana ; when your arm ain't as strong as it used to 
be, and your back gets to aching, and you feel as if you'd 
like to sit down and be quiet instead of delvin' anddelvin', 
then you'll feel as if 't would be handy to put your hand in 
your pocket and find cash somewhere. My ! I wish I had 
all the money your father spent for books. Books just 
makes some folks crazy. Do you know it's the afternoon 
for Society meeting, Diana ? ' 

' I had forgotten it. I shall not go.' 

' One of us must,' said Mrs. Starling. ' I don't see how 
in the world I can ; but I suppose I'll have to. You'll have 
to make the bread then, Diana. Yesterday's put me all 




out. And what are you going to do with all those blackberries ? They're too ripe to keep.' 

' I'll do them up this afternoon, mother. I'll take care 
of them.' 

The morning went in this way, with little intermission. 
Mrs. Starling was perhaps uneasy from an undefined fear 
that something was going not right with Diana's affairs. 
She could lay hold on no clue, but perhaps the secret fear 
or doubt was the reason why she brought up as if by sheer 
force of affinity, every small and great source of annoyance that she knew of. All the morning Diana had to hear 
and answer a string of suggestions and complainings like 
the foregoing. She was not unaccustomed to this sort of 
thing, perhaps ; and doubtless she had her own hidden antidote to annoyance : yet it belonged still more to the large 
sweet nature of the girl that though annoyed she was never 
irritated. Wrinkles never lined themselves on the fair 
smooth brow ; proper token of the depth and calm of the 
character within. 



CHAPTER X. 

IN SUGAR. 

DINNER was over, and talk ceased, for Mrs. Starling 
went to dress herself for the sewing society and presently 
drove off with Prince. Diana's motions then became as 
swift as they were noiseless. Her kitchen was in a state 
of perfected order and propriety. She went to dress herself then ; a modest dressing, for business, and kitchen 
business too, must claim her all the afternoon ; but it is 
possible to combine two effects in one's toilet ; and if you 
had seen Diana that day, you would have comprehended 
the proposition. A common print gown, clean and sum- 
mery-looking, shewed her soft outlines at least as well as 
a more modish affair would ; and the sleeves rolled up 
to the elbows revealed Diana's beautiful arms. I am 
bound to confess she had chosen a white apron in defiance 
of possible fruit stains ; and the dark hair tucked away 
behind her ears gave the whole fair cheek and temple to 
view ; fair and delicate in contour, and coloured with the very 
hues of a perfect physical condition. I think, no man bnt 
would like to see his future wife present such a picture of 
womanly beauty and housewifely efficiency, as Diana was 
that day. And the best was, she did not know it. 

She went about her work. Doubtless she had a sense 
that interruptions might come that afternoon ; however, 
that changed nothing. She had moulded her bread and 
put it in the pans and got it out of the way ; and now the 



 

berries were brought out of the pantry, and the preserving kettle went on the fire, and Diana's fingers were soon 
red with the ripe wine of the fruit. All the time she had 
' her ears open for the sound of a horse's hoofs upon the road ; 
it had not come ; so that a quick step outside startled her, 
and then the figure of Mr. Knowlton in the doorway, took 
her by surprise. Certainly she been expecting him all the 
afternoon ; but now, whether it were the surprise or somewhat else, Diana's face flushed to the most lovely rose. 
Yet she went to meet him with simple frankness. 

' I've not a hand to give you ! ' she said. 

' Not a hand ! ' he echoed. ' What a mercy it is, that 
I am independent of hands. Yesterday I should have 
been in despair ; to-day ' 

' You must not abuse your privileges,' said Diana, trying to free herself. ' And O, Mr. Knowlton, I have a great 
deal of work to do.' 

' So have I,' said he holding her fast ; and indeed she 
was too pretty a possession to be easily let go. ' Whole 
loads of talking, and no end of arrangements. Di, I never 
saw you with such a charming colour. My beauty ! Do 
you know what a beauty you are ? ' 

' I am glad you think so ! ' she said. 

' Think so ? Wait till you are my wife, and I can dress 
you to please myself. I think you will be a very princess 
of loveliness.' 

' In the mean time, Mr. Knowlton, what do you think 
of letting me finish my berries ? ' 

'Berries?' he said laughing. 'Tell me first, Di, what 
do you think of me ? ' 

' Inconvenient,' said Diana. ' And I think, presuming. 
I must finish my berries, Mr. Knowlton.' 

' Evan,' he said. 




Well ; but let me do my work.' 

' Do your work ? My darling ! How am I going to talk 
to you, if you are going into your work ? However, in 
consideration of yesterday you may.' 

' What made you come to this door ? ' Diana asked. 

' I knew you were here.' 

' You would have been much more likely to find mother, 
most days.' 

' Ah, but I met Prince, as I came along, with Mrs. Starling behind him ; and then I thought ' 

'What?' 

' I remembered,' said Knowlton laughing, ' that the same 
person cannot be in two places at once ! ' 

The comfort of this fact being upon them, the two took 
advantage of it. Mr. Knowlton drew his chair close 'to the 
table over which Diana's fingers were so busy ; and a talk 
began, which in the range and variety and arbitrary introduction of its topics, it would be in vain to try to follow. 
Through it all Diana's work went on, except now and then 
when her fingers made an involuntary pause. The berries 
were picked over, and weighed, and put over the fire, and 
watched and tended there ; while the tall form of the young 
officer stood beside Diana as she handled her skimmer, and 
went back and forth as she went, helping her to carry her 
jars of sweet-meat. 

' Have you told your mother ? ' Mr. Knowlton asked. 

' No.' 

' Why not ? ' he asked quickly. 

' I did not think it was a good time, last night or this 
morning.' 

' Does she not like me ? ' 

' I think she wants to put some one else in your place ; 
Evan.' 



 

' Who ? ' he asked instantly. 

' Nobody you need fear,' said Diana laughing. ' Nobody 
I like.' 

' Is there anybody you do like ? ' 

' Plenty of people that I like a little.' 

' How much do you like me, Diana ? ' 

She lifted her eyes and looked at him ; calm, large, 
grey eyes, into which there had come a new depth since 
yesterday and an added light. She looked at him a moment, 
and dropped them in silence. 

' Well ? ' said he eagerly. ' Why don't you speak?' 

' I cannot,' said Diana. 

' Why ? I can speak to you.' 

' I suppose people are different,' said Diana. ' And I 
am a woman.' 

' Well, what then ? ' 

She turned away, with the shyest, sweetest grace of reserve ; turned away to her fruit, quite naturally ; there was 
no shadow of affectation, nor even of consciousness. But 
her eyes did not look up again ; and Mr. Knowlton's eyes 
had no interruption. 

' Di, where do you think we shall go when we are married ? ' 

' I don't know,' she said simply ; and the tone of her 
voice said that she did not care. It was as quiet as the 
harebells when no wind is blowing. 

' And I don't know ! ' Knowlton echoed with a half- 
sigh. ' I don't know where I am going myself. But I 
shall know in a day or two. Can you be ready in a week, 
do you think, Diana ? ' 

' Shall you have to go so soon as that? ' she asked with 
a startled look up. 

' Pretty near. What of that ? You are going with me- 



 

It may be to some rough out-of-the-way place ; we never 
can tell ; you know we are a sort of foot-ball for Uncle Sam 
to toss about as he pleases ; but you are not afraid of being a soldier's wife, Di ? ' 

She looked at him without speaking ; a look clear and 
quiet and glad, like her voice when she spoke. So full of 
the thought of the reality he suggested, evidently, that she 
never perceived the occasion for a blush. Her eyes went- 
through him, to the rough country or the frontier post 
where she could share-and annul-all his harsh experiences. 

' What sort of places are those where you might go, 
Evan ? ' 

' Nearly all sorts on the face of the earth, my beauty. 
I might be sent to the neighbourhood of one of the great 
cities ; we should have a good time then, Di ! I would 
wait for nothing ; I could come and fetch you just as soon 
as I could get a furlough of a day or two. - But they are 
apt to send us, the young officers, to the hardest places ; 
posts beyond civilization, out west to the frontier, or south 
to Texas, or across to the Pacific coast. 

' California ! ' Diana cried. 

' California ; or Oregon ; or Arizona. Yes ; why ? ' 

' California is very far off. 

' Rather,' said Knowlton, with a half sigh again. ' It 
don't make any difference, if we were once there, Diana.' 

Diana looked thoughtful. It had never occurred to 
her, before this time, to wish that the country were not so 
extended ; and certainly not to fancy that California and 
she had any interest in common. Lo, now it might be. 

' How soon must you go, Evan ? ' she asked, as thoughts 
of longitude and latitude began to deepen the cloud shad- 
ow which had just touched her. 

' A few days a week or two more.' 



 

' Is that all ? ' 

' Can you go with me ? ' he whispered, bending forward 
to pick up a few of her berries, for the taste of which he 
certainly did not care at that moment. 

And she whispered, ' No.' 

' Can't you ? ' 

' You know it's impossible, Evan.' 

' Then I must go by myself,' he said, in the same half 
breath, stooping his head still so near that a half breath 
could be heard ; and his hair, quite emancipated from the 
regulation cut, touched Diana's cheek. I don't know how 
I can ! But Di if I can get a furlough at Christmas and 
come for you will you be ready then ? ' 

She whispered ' Yes.' 

' That is, supposing I am in any place that I can take 
you to, he went on, after a hearty endorsement of the contract just made. ' It is quite possible I may not be ! But 
I won't borrow trouble. This is the first trouble I ever had 
in my life, Di, leaving you.' 

' They say, prosperity makes people proud,' she said, 
with an arch glance at him. 

'Proud ? ' echoed Knowlton. ' Yes, I am proud. I have 
a right to be proud. I do not think, Diana, there is such 
a pearl in all the waters of Arabia as I shall wear on my 
hand. ~I do not believe there is a rose to equal you in all 
the gardens of the world. Look up, my beauty, and let 
me see you. I sha'n't have the chance pretty soon.' 

And yielding to the light touch of his fingers under her 
chin, caressing and persuading, Diana's face was lifted to 
view. It was like a pearl, for the childlike purity of all 
its lines ; it was like enough a rose too ; like an opening 
rose, for the matter of that. Her thoughts went back to 
the elegance of Mrs. Reverdy and Gertrude Masters, and 



 

she wondered in herself at Mr. Knowlton's judgment of 
her; but there was too much of Diana ever to depreciate 
herself unworthily. She said nothing. 

' I wonder what will become you best ? ' said Evan in a 
very satisfied tone. 

' Become me ? ' said Diana lifting her eyes. 

' Yes. .What's your colour? ' 

' I am sure I don't know,' said Diana laughing. ' No 
one in particular, I guess.' 

' Wear everything, can you ? I shouldn't wonder ! But I 
think I should like you in white. That's cold for winter 
in some regions. I think I should like you in let me 
see shew me your eyes again, Diana. If you wear so 
much rose in your cheeks, my darling,' said he, kissing 
first one and then the other, ' I should be safe to get you 
green. You will be lovely in blue. But of all, except white, 
I think I should like you, Diana, in royal red.' 

' I thought purple was the colour of kings and queens,' 
Diana remarked, trying to get back to her berries. 

' Purple is poetical. I am certain a dark, rich red 
would be magnificent on you ; for it is you who will beautify the colour, not the colour you. I shall get you the 
first stuff of that colour I see that is of the right hue.' 

' Pray don't, Evan. Wait,' said Diana, flushing more 
and more. 

' Wait ? I'll not wait a minute longer than till I see it. 
My beauty ! what a delight to get things for you and with 
you. Officers' quarters are sorry places sometimes, Diana ; 
but won't it be fun for you and me to work transformations, and make our own world ; that is our own home ? 
What does Mrs. Starling think of me ? ' 

' I have told her nothing, Evan, yet. She was so busy 
this morning, I had not a good chance.' 



 

' I'll confront her when she comes home this evening.' 

' O no, Evan ; leave it to me, I want to take a  time. 
She will not like it much anyhow.' 

' I don't see really how she should. I have sympathy 
no, I haven't ! I haven't a bit. I am so full of my own 
side of the question, it is sheer hypocrisy to pretend I have 
any feeling for anybody else. When will you come down 
to Elmfield ? ' 

' To Elmfield ? ' said Diana. 

' To begin to learn to know them all. I want them to 
know you.' 

' You have not spoken to them about me ? ' 

' No,' said he laughing ; ' but I mean to.' 

'Evan, don't say anything to anybody till mother has 
been told. Promise me ! That would not do.' 

'All's safe yet, Di. But make haste with your revelations ; for I shall be here to-morrow night and every night 
now, and astonish her; and it isn't healthy for some people 
to be astonished. Besides, Di, my orders will be here in a 
week or two ; and then I must go.' 

' Do you like being under orders ? ' said Diana innocently. 

Knowlton's grave face changed again ; and laughing 
he asked if she did not like it ? and how she would do when 
she would be a soldier's wife, and so under double orders ? 
and he got into such a game of merriment, at her and with 
her, that Diana did not know what to do with herself or 
her berries either. How the berries got attended to is a 
mystery ; but it shews that the action of the mind can grow 
mechanical where it has been very much exercised. It can 
scarce be said that Diana thought of the blackberries ; and 
yet, the jam was made and the wine prepared for in a most 
regular and faultless manner ; the jars were filled duly, and 



 

nothing was burned, and all was done and cleared away 
before Mrs. Starling came home. Literally ; for Mr. 
Knowlton had been sent away, and Diana had gone up to 
the sanctuary of her own room. She did not wish to encounter her mother that night. While the dew was not 
yet off her flowers, she would smell their sweetness alone. 



CHAPTER XI. 

A STORM IN SEPTEMBER. 

DIANA was not put to the trial next day of venturing 
her precious things to harsh handling. A very uncommon 
thing happened. Mrs. Starling was not well, and kept her 
bed. 

She had caught cold, she confessed, by some imprudence 
the day before ; and symptoms of pleurisy made it impossible that she should fight sickness as she liked to fight it, 
on foot. The doctor was not to be thought of; Mrs. 
Starling gave her best and only confidence to her own, 
skill ; but even that bade her lie by and "give up." 

Diana had the whole house on her hands, as well as 
the nursing. Truth to tell, this last was not much. Mrs. 
Starling would have very little of her daughter's presence ; 
still less of her ministrations. To be " let alone " was 
her principal demand ; and that Diana should " keep 
things straight below." Diana did that. The house went 
on as well as ever ; and even the farm affairs received the 
needful supervision. Josiah Davis was duly ordered, fed, 
and dismissed ; and when evening came, Diana was dressed, 
in order, bright, and ready for company. Company it 
pleased her to receive in the lean-to kitchen ; the sound of 
voices and laughter beneath her would have roused Mrs. 
Starling to a degree of excitement from which it would 
have been impossible to keep back anything  and probably 



 

to a degree of consequent indignation which would have 
been capable of very informal measures of ejectment 
regarding the intruder. No, Diana could not risk that. 
She must wait till her mother's nerves and temper were at 
least in their ordinary state of wholesome calm, before she 
would shock them by the disclosures she had to make. 
And almost by their preciousness to herself, Diana gauged 
their unvvelcomeness to her mother. It was always so. The 
two natures were so unlike that not even the long habit 
of years could draw them into sympathy. They thought 
alike about nothing except the housewifely matters of 
practical life. So these evenings when Mrs. Starling was 
ill, Diana had her lamp and her fire in the lean-to kitchen ; 
and there were held the long talks with Mr. Knowlton 
which made all the days of September so golden. Days 
when Diana's hands were too busy to let her see him, and 
he was told he must not come except at night ; but through 
all the business streamed the radiant glow of the last 
night's talk; like the September sunlight through the 
misty air. 

So the days went by ; and Mrs. Starling was kept a 
prisoner ; pain and weakness warning her she must not 
dare try anything else. And in their engrossment the two 
young people hardly noticed how the time flew. People 
in Pleasant Valley were not in the habit of paying visits 
to one another in the evenings, unless specially invited ; 
so nobody discovered that Evan came nightly to Mrs. 
Starling's house ; and if his own people wondered at his 
absence from home, they could do no more. Suspicion 
had no ground to go upon in any particular direction. 

The month had been glorious with golden leaves and 
golden sunshine, until the middle was more than past. 
Then came a September storm; an equinoctial; the people 



 

said ; as furious as the preceding days had been gentle. 
Whirlwinds of tempest and floods of rain ; legions of 
clouds, rank after rank, bringing the winds in their folds ; 
or did the winds bring them ? All one day and night and 
all the next day the storm continued ; and night darkened 
early upon Pleasant Valley with no prospect of a change. 
Diana had watched for it a little eagerly ; Evan's visit was 
lost the night before of course ; it was much to lose, when 
September days were growing few ; and now another night 
he could not come. Diana stood at the lean-to door after 
supper, looking and making her conclusions sorrowfully. 
It was darkening fast ; very dark it would be, for there 
was no moon. The rain came down in streams, thick and 
grey. The branches of the elm trees swung and swayed 
pitilessly in the wind, beating against each other ; while the 
wind whistled and shouted its intention of keeping on so
