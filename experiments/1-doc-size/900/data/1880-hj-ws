" No ; that's of course. But in his admiration for 
Catherine?" 

"Deeply sincere. He has said to me the most 
appreciative, the most charming things about her. 
He would say them to you, if he were sure you 
would listen to him gently." 



"I doubt whether I can undertake it. He ap- 
pears to require a great deal of gentleness." 

" He is a sympathetic, sensitive nature," said Mrs. 
Penniman. 

Her brother puffed his cigar again in silence. 
" These delicate qualities have survived his vicissi- 
tudes, eh ? All this while you haven't told me about 
his misfortunes." 

" It is a long story," said Mrs. Penniman, " and I 
regard it as a sacred trust. But I suppose there is 
no objection to my saying that he has been wild 
he frankly confesses that. But he has paid for it." 

" That's what has impoverished him, eh f ' 

"I don't mean simply in money. He is very 
much alone in the world." 

" Do you mean that he has behaved so badly that 
his friends have given him up ?" 

" He has had false friends, who have deceived and 
betrayed him." 

" He seems to have some good ones too. He has 
a devoted sister, and half a dozen nephews and 
nieces." 

Mrs. Penniman was silent a minute. " The neph- 
ews and nieces are children, and the sister is not a 
very attractive person." 

"I hope he doesn't abuse her to you," said the 
Doctor ; " for I am told he lives upon her." 

" Lives upon her ?" 

" Lives with her, and does nothing for himself ; 
it is about the same thing." 

" He is looking for a position most earnestly," said 
Mrs. Penniman. " He hopes every day to find one." 

" Precisely. He is looking for it here over there 





in the front parlor. The position of husband of a 
weak-minded woman with a large fortune would 
suit him to perfection !" 

Mrs. Penniman was truly amiable, but she now 
gave signs of temper. She rose with much anima- 
tion, and stood for a moment looking at her brother. 
" My dear Austin," she remarked, " if you regard 
Catherine as a weak-minded woman you are particu- 
larly mistaken !" And with this she moved majes- 
tically away. 



IX. 

IT was a regular custom with the family in Wash- 
ington Square to go and spend Sunday evening at 
Mrs. Almond's. On the Sunday after the conversa- 
tion I have just narrated this custom was not in- 
termitted ; and on this occasion, toward the middle 
of the evening, Doctor Sloper found reason to with- 
draw to the library with his brother-in-law, to talk 
over a matter of business. He was absent some 
twenty minutes, and when he came back into the 
circle, which was enlivened by the presence of sev- 
eral friends of the family, he saw that Morris Towns- 
end had come in, and had lost as little time as pos- 
sible in seating himself on a small sofa beside Cathe- 
rine. In the large room, where several different 
groups had been formed, and the hum of voices and 
of laughter was loud, these two young persons might 
confabulate, as the Doctor phrased it to himself, 
without attracting attention. He saw in a moment, 
however, that his daughter was painfully conscious 





of his own observation. She sat motionless, with 
her eyes bent down, staring at her open fan, deeply 
flushed, shrinking together as if to minimize the in- 
discretion of which she confessed herself guilty. 

The Doctor almost pitied her. Poor Catherine 
was not defiant ; she had no genius for bravado, and 
as she felt that her father viewed her companion's 
attentions with an unsympathizing eye, there was 
nothing but discomfort for her in the accident of 
seeming to challenge him. The Doctor felt, indeed, 
so sorry for her that he turned away, to spare her 
the sense of being watched ; and he was so intelli- 
gent a man that, in his thoughts, he rendered a sort 
of poetic justice to her situation. 

" It must be deucedly pleasant for a plain, inani- 
mate girl like that to have a beautiful young fellow 
come and sit down beside her, and whisper to her 
that he is her slave if that is what this one whis- 
pers. No wonder she likes it, and that she thinks 
me a cruel tyrant ; which of course she does, though 
she is afraid she hasn't the animation necessary 
to admit it to herself. Poor old Catherine !" mused 
the Doctor; "I verily believe she is capable of de- 
fending me when Townsend abuses me !" 

And the force of this reflection, for the moment, 
was such in making him feel the natural opposition 
between his point of view and that of an infatuated 
child, that he said to himself that he was perhaps 
after all taking things too hard, and crying out be- 
fore he was hurt. He must not condemn Morris 
Townsend unheard. He had a great aversion to 
taking things too hard ; he thought that half the 
discomfort and many of the disappointments of life 





come from it ; and for an instant lie asked himself 
whether, possibly, he did not appear ridiculous to 
this intelligent young man, whose private percep- 
tion of incongruities he suspected of being keen. 
At the end of a quarter of an hour Catherine had 
got rid of him, and Townsend was now standing be- 
fore the fireplace in conversation with Mrs. Almond. 

" We will try him again," said the Doctor. And 
he crossed the room and joined his sister and her 
companion, making her a sign that she should leave 
the young man to him. She presently did so, while 
Morris looked at him, smiling, without a sign of 
evasiveness in his affable eye. 

" He's amazingly conceited !" thought the Doctor ; 
and then he said, aloud, " I am told you are looking 
out for a position." 

" Oh, a position is more than I should presume 
to call it," Morris Townsend answered. " That 
sounds so fine. I should like some quiet work 
something to turn an honest penny." 

" What sort of thing should you prefer ?" 

" Do you mean what am I fit for ? Yery little, I 
am afraid. I have nothing but my good right arm, 
as they say in the melodramas." 

" You are too modest," said the Doctor. " In ad- 
dition to your good right arm you have your subtle 
brain. I know nothing of you but what I see; but 
I see by your physiognomy that you are extremely 
intelligent." 

"Ah," Townsend murmured, " I don't know what 
to answer when you say that. You advise me, then, 
not to despair ?" 

And he looked at his interlocutor as if the ques- 





tion might have a double meaning. The Doctor 
caught the look and weighed it a moment before he 
replied. "I should be very sorry to admit that a 
robust and well-disposed young man need ever de- 
spair. If he doesn't succeed in one thing, he can 
try another. Only, I should add, he should choose 
his line with discretion." 

" Ah, yes, with discretion," Morris Townsend re- 
peated, sympathetically. "Well, I have been indis- 
creet, formerly ; but I think I have got over it. I 
am very steady now." And he stood a moment, 
looking down at his remarkably neat shoes. Then 
at last, "Were you kindly intending to propose 
something for my advantage ?" he inquired, looking 
up and smiling. 

"D n his impudence!" the Doctor exclaimed, 
privately. But in a moment he reflected that he 
himself had, after all, touched first upon this delicate 
point, and that his words might have been construed 
as an offer of assistance. " I have no particular pro- 
posal to make," he presently said ; " but it occurred 
to me to let you know that I have you in my mind. 
Sometimes one hears of opportunities. For in- 
stance, should you object to leaving New York to 
going to a distance ?" 

"I am afraid I shouldn't be able to manage that. 
I must seek my fortune here or nowhere. You see," 
added Morris Townsend, " I have ties I have re- 
sponsibilities here. I have a sister, a widow, from 
whom I have been separated for a long time, and to 
whom I am almost everything. I shouldn't like to 
say to her that I must leave her. She rather de- 
pends upon me, you see." 





" All, that's very proper ; family feeling is very 
proper," said Doctor Sloper. " I often think there 
is not enough of it in our city. I think I have 
heard of your sister." 

" It is possible, but I rather doubt it ; she lives so 
very quietly." 

"As quietly, you mean," the Doctor went on, with 
a short laugh, " as a lady may do who has several 
young children." 

" Ah, my little nephews and nieces that's the very 
point ! I am helping to bring them up," said Mor- 
ris Townsend. " I am a kind of amateur tutor ; I 
give them lessons." 

" That's very proper, as I say ; but it is hardly a 
career." 

" It won't make my fortune," the young man 
confessed. 

" You must not be too much bent on a fortune," 
said the Doctor. " But I assure you I will keep you 
in mind ; I won't lose sight of you." 

" If my situation becomes desperate I shall per- 
haps take the liberty of reminding you," Morris re- 
joined, raising his voice a little, with a brighter smile, 
as his interlocutor turned away. 

Before he left the house the Doctor had a few 
words with Mrs. Almond. 

" I should like to see his sister," he said. " What 
do you call her Mrs. Montgomery ? I should like 
to have a little talk with her." 

" I will try and manage it," Mrs. Almond re- 
sponded. " I will take the first opportunity of in- 
viting her, and you shall come and meet her ; 
unless, indeed," Mrs. Almond added, " she first 





takes it into her head to be sick and to send for 
you." 

"Ah no, not that ; she must have trouble enough 
without that. But it would have its advantages, for 
then I should see the children. I should like very 
much to see the children." 

"You are very thorough. Do you want to cate- 
chise them about their uncle ?" 

" Precisely. Their uncle tells me he has charge 
of their education, that he saves their mother the ex- 
pense of school-bills. I should like to ask them a 
few questions in the commoner branches." 

" He certainly has not the cut of a school-mas- 
ter," Mrs. Almond said to herself a short time after- 
ward, as she saw Morris Townsend in a corner bend- 
ing over her niece, who was seated. 

And there was, indeed, nothing in the young 
man's discourse at this moment that savored of the 
pedagogue. 

"Will you meet me somewhere to-morrow or 
next day ?" he said, in a low tone, to Catherine. 

" Meet you ?" she asked, lifting her frightened eyes. 

" I have something particular to say to you very 
particular." 

" Can't you come to the house ? Can't you say it 
there ?" 

Townsend shook his head gloomily. " I can't en- 
ter your doors again." 

" Oh, Mr. Townsend !" murmured Catherine. She 
trembled as she wondered what had happened 
whether her father had forbidden it. 

" I can't, in self-respect," said the young man. 
" Your father has insulted rne." 





"Insulted you?" 

" He has taunted me with my poverty." 

" Oh, you are mistaken you misunderstood him !" 
Catherine spoke with energy, getting up from her 
chair. 

"Perhaps I am too proud too sensitive. But 
would you have me otherwise ?" he asked, tenderly. 

" Where my father is concerned, you must not be 
sure. He is full of goodness," said Catherine. 

" He laughed at me for having no position. I 
took it quietly ; but only because he belongs to you." 

" I don't know," said Catherine " I don't know 
what he thinks. I am sure he means to be kind. 
You must not be too proud." 

" I will be proud only of you," Morris answered. 
"Will you meet me in the Square in the afternoon?" 

A great blush on Catherine's part had been the 
answer to the declaration I have just quoted. She 
turned away, heedless of his question. 

" Will you meet me ?" he repeated. " It is very 
quiet there no one need see us toward dusk." 

"It is you who are unkind, it is you who laugh, 
when you say such things as that." 

" My dear girl !" the young man murmured. 

" You know how little there is in me to be proud 
of. I am ugly and stupid." 

Morris greeted this remark with an ardent mur- 
mur, in which she recognized nothing articulate but 
an assurance that she was his own dearest. 

But she went on. "I am not even I am not 
even And she paused a moment. 

"You are not what?" 

" I am not even brave." 





"Ah, then, if you are afraid, what shall we do?" 
She hesitated awhile; then at last "You must 
come to the house," she said ; " I am not afraid of 
that." 

"I would rather it were in the Square," the 
young man urged. "You know how empty it is, 
often. No one will see us." 

" I don't care who sees us. But leave me now." 
He left her resignedly ; he had got what he want- 
ed. Fortunately he was ignorant that half an hour 
later, going home with her father, and feeling him 
near, the poor girl, in spite of her sudden declaration 
of courage, began to tremble again. Her father said 
nothing; but she had an idea his eyes were fixed 
upon her in the darkness. Mrs. Penniman also was 
silent; Morris Townsend had told her that her niece 
preferred, unromantically, an interview in a chintz- 
covered parlor to a sentimental tryst beside a foun- 
tain sheeted with dead leaves, and she was lost in 
wonderment at the oddity almost the perversity 
of the choice. 



X. 

CATHERINE received the young man the next day 
on the ground she had chosen amidst the chaste up- 
holstery of a New York drawing-room furnished in 
the fashion of fifty years ago. Morris had swallow- 
ed his pride, and made the effort necessary to cross 
the threshold of her too derisive parent an act of 
magnanimity which could not fail to render him 
doubly interesting. 





"We must settle something we must take a 
line," he declared, passing his hand through his hair 
and giving a glance at the long, narrow mirror which 
adorned the space between the two windows, and 
which had at its base a little gilded bracket covered 
by a thin slab of white marble, supporting in its turn 
a backgammon-board folded together in the shape 
of two volumes two shining folios inscribed, in 
greenish-gilt letters, History of England. If Morris 
had been pleased to describe the master of the house 
as a heartless scoffer, it is because he thought him 
too much on his guard, and this was the easiest way 
to express his own dissatisfaction a dissatisfaction 
which he had made a point of concealing from the 
Doctor. It will probably seem to the reader, how- 
ever, that the Doctor's vigilance was by no means 
excessive, and that these two young people had an 
open field. Their intimacy was now considerable, 
and it may appear that, for a shrinking and retiring 
person, our heroine had been liberal of her favors. 
The young man, within a few days, had made her 
listen to things for which she had not supposed that 
she was prepared ; having a lively foreboding of 
difficulties, he proceeded to gain as much ground as 
possible in the present. He remembered that fort- 
une favors the brave, and even if he had forgotten 
it, Mrs. Penniman would have remembered it for 
him. Mrs. Penniman delighted of all things in a 
drama, and she flattered herself that a drama would 
now be enacted. Combining as she did the zeal of 
the prompter with the impatience of the spectator, 
she had long since done her utmost to pull up the 
curtain. She, too, expected to figure in the perform- 





ance to be the confidante, the Chorus, to speak the 
epilogue. It may even be said that there were 
times when she lost sight altogether of the modest 
heroine of the play in the contemplation of certain 
great scenes which would naturally occur between 
the hero and herself. 

What Morris had told Catherine at last was sim- 
ply that he loved her, or rather adored her. Virtu- 
ally , he had made known as much already his vis- 
its had been a series of eloquent intimations of it. 
But now he had 'affirmed it in lover's vows, and, as a 
memorable sign of it, he had passed his arm round 
the girl's waist and taken a kiss. This happy certi- 
tude had come sooner than Catherine expected, and 
she had regarded it, very naturally, as a priceless 
treasure. It may even be doubted whether she had 
ever definitely expected to possess it ; she had not 
been waiting for it, and she had never said to her- 
self that at a given moment it must come. As I 
have tried to explain, she was not eager and exact- 
ing ; she took what was given her from day to day ; 
and if the delightful custom of her lover's visits, 
which yielded her a happiness in which confidence 
and timidity were strangely blended, had suddenly 
come to an end, she would not only not have spoken 
of herself as one of the forsaken, but she would not 
have thought of herself as one of the disappointed. 
After Morris had kissed her, the last time he was 
with her, as a ripe assurance of his devotion, she 
begged him to go away, to leave her alone, to let her 
think. Morris went away, taking another kiss first. 
But Catherine's meditations had lacked a certain 
coherence. She felt his kisses on her lips and on 





her cheeks for a long time afterward ; the sensation 
was rather an obstacle than an aid to reflection. She 
would have liked to see her situation all clearly be- 
fore her, to make up her mind what she should do 
if, as she feared, her father should tell her that he 
disapproved of Morris Townsend. But all that she 
could see with any vividness was that it was terribly 
strange that any one should disapprove of him ; 
that there must in that case be some mistake, some 
mystery, which in a little while would be set at rest. 
She put off deciding and choosing; before the vi- 
sion of a conflict with her father she dropped her 
eyes and sat motionless, holding her breath and 
waiting. It made her heart beat ; it was intensely 
painful. When Morris kissed her and said these 
things that also made her heart beat ; but this was 
worse, and it frightened her. Nevertheless, to-day, 
when the young man spoke of settling something, 
taking a line, she felt that it was the truth, and she 
answered very simply and without hesitating. 

"We must do our duty," she said; "we must 
speak to my father. I will do it to-night ; you must 
do it to-morrow." 

" It is very good of you to do it first," Morris an- 
swered. " The young man the happy lover gen- 
erally does that. But just as you please." 

It pleased Catherine to think that she should be 
brave for his sake, and in her satisfaction she even 
gave a little smile. " Women have more tact," she 
said; "they ought to do it first. They are more 
conciliating ; they can persuade better." 

"You will need all your powers of persuasion. 
But, after all," Morris added, " you are irresistible." 





" Please don't speak that way and promise me 
this: To-morrow, when you talk with father, you 
will be very gentle and respectful." 

" As much so as possible," Morris promised. " It 
won't be much use, but I shall try. I certainly 
would rather have you easily than have to fight for 
you." 

" Don't talk about fighting ; we shall not fight." 

" Ah, we must be prepared," Morris rejoined ; 
" you especially, because for you it must come hard- 
est. Do you know the first thing your father will 
say to you ?" 

" No, Morris ; please tell me." 

" He will tell you I am mercenary." 

" Mercenary !" 

" It's a big word, but it means a low thing. It 
means that I am after your money." 

" Oh !" murmured Catherine, softly. 

The exclamation was so deprecating and touching 
that Morris indulged in another little demonstration 
of affection. "But he will be sure to say it," he 
added. 

" It will be easy to be prepared for that," Catherine 
said. " I shall simply say that he is mistaken that 
other men may be that way, but that you are not." 

" You must make a great point of that, for it will 
be his own great point." 

Catherine looked at her lover a minute, and then 
she said, " I shall persuade him. But I am glad we 
shall be rich," she added. 

Morris turned away, looking into the crown of his 
hat. " No, it's a misfortune," he said at last. " It 
is from that our difficulty will come." 





" "Well, if it is the worst misfortune, we are not so 
unhappy. Many people would not think it so bad. 
I will persuade him, and after that we shall be very 
glad we have money." 

Morris Townsend listened to this robust logic in 
silence. " I will leave my defence to you ; it's a 
charge that a man has to stoop to defend himself 
from.'* 

Catherine on her side was silent for awhile ; she 
was looking at him while he looked, with a good 
deal of fixedness, out of the window. "Morris," 
she said, abruptly, " are you very sure you love me?" 

He turned round, and in a moment he was bend- 
ing over her. " My own dearest, can you doubt it ?" 

" I have only known it five days," she said ; 
"but now it seems to me as if I could never do 
without it." 

" You will never be called upon to try." And he 
gave a little tender, reassuring laugh. Then, in a 
moment, he added, " There is something you must 
tell me, too." She had closed her eyes after the last 
words she uttered, and kept them closed; and at 
this she nodded her head, without opening them. 
" You must tell me," he went on, " that if your fa- 
ther is dead against me, if he absolutely forbids our 
marriage, you will still be faithful." 

Catherine opened her eyes, gazing at him, and she 
could give no better promise than what he read 
there. 

"You will cleave to me?" said Morris. "You 
know you are your own mistress you are of age." 

"Ah, Morris !" she murmured, for all answer ; or 
rather not for all, for she put her hand into his own. 





He kept it awhile, and presently he kissed her again. 
This is all that need be recorded of their conversa- 
tion ; but Mrs. Penniman, if she had been present, 
would probably have admitted that it was as well it 
had not taken place beside the fountain in Washing- 
ton Square. 



XI. 

CATHERINE listened for her father when he came 
in that evening, and she heard him go to his study. 
She sat quiet, though her heart was beating fast, for 
nearly half an hour; then she went and knocked 
at his door va ceremony without which she never 
crossed the threshold of this apartment. On enter- 
ing it now, she found him in his chair beside the 
fire, entertaining himself with a cigar and the even- 
ing paper. 

" I have something to say to you," she began very 
gently; and she sat down in the first place that 
offered. 

" I shall be very happy to hear it, my dear," said 
her father. He waited waited, looking at her 
while she stared, in a long silence, at the fire. He 
was curious and impatient, for he was sure she was 
going to speak of Morris Townsend ; but he let her 
take her own time, for he was determined to be very 
mild. 

" I am engaged to be married !" Catherine an- 
nounced at last, still staring at the fire. 

The Doctor was startled ; the accomplished fact 
was more than he had expected ; but he betrayed 





no surprise. " You do right to tell me," he simply 
said. "And who is the happy mortal whom you 
have honored with your choice ?" 

" Mr. Morris Townsend." And as she pronounced 
her lover's name Catherine looked at him. What 
she saw was her father's still gray eye and his clear- 
cut, definite smile. She contemplated these objects 
for a moment, and then she looked back at the fire ; 
it was much warmer. 

" When was this arrangement made ?" the Doctor 
asked. 

" This afternoon two hours ago." 

" Was Mr. Townsend here ?" 

" Yes, father ; in the front-parlor." She was very 
glad that she was not obliged to tell him that the 
ceremony of their betrothal had taken place out 
there under the bare ailantus-trees. 

" Is it serious ?" said the Doctor. 

" Yery serious, father." 

Her father was silent a moment. "Mr. Towns- 
end ought to have told me." 

" He means to tell you to-morrow." 

" After I know all about it from you ? He 
ought to have told me before. Does he think 
I didn't care, because I left you so much lib- 
erty?" 

" Oh no," said Catherine ; " he knew you would 
care. And we have been so much obliged to you 
for for the liberty." 

The Doctor gave a short laugh. "You might 
have made a better use of it, Catherine." 

" Please don't say that, father !" the girl urged, 
softly, fixing her dull and gentle eyes upon him. 



He puffed his cigar awhile, meditatively. " You 
have gone very fast," he said, at last. 

" Yes," Catherine answered, simply ; " I think we 
have." 

Her father glanced at her an instant, removing his 
eyes from the h're. " I don't wonder Mr. Townsend 
likes you ; you are so simple and so good." 

" I don't know why it is ; but he does like me. 
I am sure of that." 

" And are you very fond of Mr. Townsend ?" 

" I like him very much, of course, or I shouldn't 
consent to marry him." 

" But you have known him a very short time, my 
dear." 

" Oh," said Catherine, with some eagerness, " it 
doesn't take long to like a person when once you 
begin." 

"You must have begun very quickly. Was it 
the first time you saw him that night at your aunt's 
party?" 

" I don't know, father," the girl answered. " I 
can't tell you about that." 

" Of course ; that's your own affair. You will 
have observed that I have acted on that principle. 
I have not interfered ; I have left you your liberty ; 
I have remembered that you are no longer a little 
girl that you have arrived at years of discretion." 

" I feel very old and very wise," said Catherine, 
smiling faintly. 

" I am afraid that before long you will feel older 
and wiser yet. I don't like your engagement." 

"Ah!" Catherine exclaimed, softly, getting up 
from her chair. 



" No, my dear. I am sorry to give you pain ; but 
I don't like it. You should have consulted me be- 
fore you settled it. I have been too easy with you, 
and I feel as if you had taken advantage of my in- 
dulgence. Most decidedly you should have spoken 
to me first." 

Catherine hesitated a moment, and then " It was 
because I was afraid you wouldn't like it," she con- 
fessed. 

"Ah, there it is ! You had a bad conscience." 

" No, I have not a bad conscience, father !" the 
girl cried out, with considerable energy. " Please 
don't accuse me of anything so dreadful !" These 
words, in fact, represented to her imagination some- 
thing very terrible indeed, something base and cruel, 
which she associated with malefactors and prison- 
ers. " It was because I was afraid afraid " she 
went on. 

" If you were afraid, it was because you had been 
foolish." 

" I was afraid you didn't like Mr. Townsend." 

" You were quite right. I don't like him." 

" Dear father, you don't know him," said Cathe- 
rine, in a voice so timidly argumentative that it 
might have touched him. 

" Very true ; I don't know him intimately. But 
I know him enough ; I have my impression of him. 
You don't know him either." 

She stood before the fire with her hands lightly 
clasped in front of her ; and her father, leaning back 
in his chair and looking up at her, made this remark 
with a placidity that might have been irritating. 

I doubt, however, whether Catherine was irritated, 





though she broke into a vehement protest. " I don't 
know him ?" she cried. " Why, I know him better 
than I have ever known any one !" 

" You know a part of him what he has chosen 
to show you. But you don't know the rest." 

" The rest ? What is the rest ?" 

" Whatever it may be, there is sure to be plenty 
of it." 

" I know what you mean," said Catherine, remem- 
bering how Morris had forewarned her. " You mean 
that he is mercenary." 

Her father looked up at her still, with his cold, 
quiet, reasonable eye. " If I meant it, my dear, I 
should say it ! But there is an error I wish partic- 
ularly to avoid that of rendering Mr. Townsend 
more interesting to you by saying hard things about 
him." 

" I won't think them hard if they are true," said 
Catherine. 

" If you don't, you will be a remarkably sensible 
young woman !" 

" They will be your reasons, at any rate, and you 
will want me to hear your reasons." 

The Doctor smiled a little. " Yery true. You
