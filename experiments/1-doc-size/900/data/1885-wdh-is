situation very scientifically, and if not very conclu- 
sively, how few are the absolute conclusions of 
science upon any point ! 

" He is a bachelor, and there is a natural affinity 
between bachelors and widows — much more than if 
he were a widower too. If he were a widower I 
should say it was undoubtedly mademoiselle. If he 



 

were a little bit younger, I should have no doubt it 
was madame ; but men of that age have such an am- 
bition to marry young girls ! I suppose that they 
think it proves they are not so very old, after all. 
And certainly he isn't too old to marry. If he were 
wise — which he probably isn't, if he 's like other men 
in such matters — there wouldn't be any question 
about Mrs. Bowen. Pretty creature ! And so much 
sense ! Too much for him. Ah, my dear, how we 
are wasted upon that sex ! " 

Mrs. Bowen herself treated the affair with masterly 
frankness. More than once in varying phrase, she 
said : " You are very good to give us so much of 
your time, Mr. Colville, and I won't pretend I don't 
know it. You 're helping me out with a very hazard- 
ous experiment. When I undertook to see Imogene 
through a winter in Florence, I didn't reflect what a 
very gay time girls have at home, in Western towns 
especially. But I haven't heard her breathe Buffalo 
once. And I 'm sure it 's doing her a great deal of 
good here. She 's naturally got a very good mind ; 
she 's very ambitious to be cultivated. She 's read a 
good deal, and she 's anxious to know history and 
art ; and your advice and criticism are the greatest 
possible advantage to her.'' 

"Thank you," said Colville, with a fine, remote 
dissatisfaction. " I supposed I was merely enjoying 
myself." 

He had lately begun to haunt his banker's for in- 
formation in regard to the Carnival balls, with the 
hope that something might be made out of them. 



 

But either there were to be no great CarDival balls, 
or it was a mistake to suppose that his banker ought 
to know about them. Colville went experimentally 
to one of the people's balls at a minor theatre, which 
he found advertised on the house walls. At half- 
past ten the dancing had not begun, but the masks 
were arriving ; young women in gay silks and dirty 
white gloves ; men in women's dresses, with enor- 
mous hands ; girls as pages ; clowns, pantaloons, old 
women, and the like. They were all very good- 
humoured ; the men, who far outnumbered the 
women, danced contentedly together. Colville liked 
two cavalry soldiers who waltzed with each other for 
an hour, and then went off to a battery on exhibition 
in the pit, and had as much electricity as they could 
hold. He liked also two young citizens who danced 
together as long as he stayed, and did not leave off 
even for electrical refreshment. He came away at 
midnight, pushing out of the theatre through a crowd 
of people at the door, some of whom were tipsy. 
This certainly would not have done for the ladies, 
though the people were civilly tipsy. 



IX. 



The next morning Paolo, when he brought up 
Colville's brealrfast, brought the news that there was 
to be a veglione at the Pergola Theatre. This news 
revived Colville's courage. " Paolo," he said, " you 
ought to open a banking-house." Paolo was used to 
being joked by foreigners who could not speak 
Italian very well ; he smiled as if he understood. 

The banker had his astute doubts of Paolo's in- 
telligence ; the banker in Europe doubts all news 
not originating in his house ; but after a day or two 
the advertisements in the newspapers carried con- 
viction even to the banker. 

When Colville went to the ladies with news of the 
veglione, he found that they had already heard of it. 
" Should you like to go ? " he asked Mrs. Bowen. 

"I don't know. What do you think ?" she asked 
in turn. 

"Oh, it's for you to do the thinking. I only 
know what I want." 

Imogene said nothing, while she watched the in- 
ternal debate as it expressed itself in Mrs. Bowen's 
face. 



 

"People go in boxes," she said thoughtfully; 
"but you would feel that a box wasn't the same 
thing exactly ? " , 

" We went on the floor," suggested Colville. 

" It was very different then. And, besides, Mrs. 
Finlay had absolutely no sense of propriety." When 
a woman has explicitly condemned a given action, 
she apparently gathers courage for its commission 
under a little different conditions. " Of course, if 
we went upon the floor, I shouldn't wish it to be 
known at all, though foreigners can do almost any- 
thing they like." 

" Eeally," said Colville, " when it comes to that, 
I don't see any harm in it.'' 

" And you say go 'i " 

" I say whatever you say." 

Mrs. Bowen looked from him to Imogene. " I 
don't either," she said finally, and they understood 
that she meant the harm which he had not seen. 

" Which of us has been so good as to deserve 
this ] " asked Colville. 

" Oh, you have all been good," she said. " We 
shall go in masks and dominoes," she continued. 
" Nothing will happen, and who should know us 
if anything did ? " They had received tickets to 
the great Borghese ball, which is still a fashion- 
able and desired event of the Carnival to foreigners 
in Florence ; but their preconceptions of the 
veghone threw into the shade the entertainment 
which the gentlemen of Florence offered to favoured 
sojourners. 



 

"Come," said Mrs. Bowen, "you must go with 
us and help us choose our dominoes." 

A prudent woman does not do an imprudent 
thing by halves. Effie was to be allowed to go to 
the veglione too, and she went with them to the 
shop where they were to hire their dominoes. It 
would be so much more fun, Mrs. Bowen said, to 
choose the dresses in the shop than to have them 
sent home for you to look at. Effie was to be in 
black; Imogene was to have a light blue domino, 
and Mrs. Bowen chose a purple one; even where 
their faces were not to be seen they considered their 
complexions in choosing the colours. If you hap- 
pened to find a friend, and wanted to unmask, you 
would not want to look horrid. The shop people 
took the vividest interest in it all, as if it were a 
new thing to them, and these were the first foreigners 
they had ever served with masks and dominoes. 
They made Mrs. Bowen and Imogene go into an 
inner room and come out for the mystification of 
Colville, hulking about in the front shop with his 
mask and domino on. 

" Which is which ? " the ladies both challenged 
him, in the mask's conventional falsetto, when they 
came out. 

With a man's severe logic he distinguished them 
according to their silks, but there had been time for 
them to think of changing, and they took off their 
masks to laugh in his face. 

They fluttered so airily about among the pendent 
masks and dominoes, from which they shook a 




ghostly perfume of old carnivals, that his heart 
leaped. 

" Ah, you 'll never he so fascinating again ! " he 
cried. He wanted to take them in his arms, they 
were both so delicious; a man has still only that 
primitive way of expressing his supreme satisfaction 
in women. " Now, which am I ? " he demanded of 
them, and that made them laugh again. He had 
really put his arm about Effie. 

" Do you think you will know your papa at the 
veglione t " asked one of the shop-women, with a 
mounting interest in the amiable family party. 

They all laughed ; the natural mistake seemed 
particularly droll to Imogene. 

" Come," cried Mrs. Bowen ; " it 's time we should 
be going." 

That was true ; they had passed so long a time in 
the shop that they did not feel justified in seriously 
attempting to beat down the price of their dresses. 
They took them at the first price. The woman said 
with reason that it was Carnival, and she could get 
her price for the things. 

They went to the veglione at eleven, the ladies 
calling for Colville, as before, in Mrs. Bowen's car- 
riage. He felt rather sheepish, coming out of his 
room in his mask and domino, but the corridors of 
the hotel were empty, and for the most part dark ; 
there was no one up but the porter, who wished him 
a pleasant time in as matter-of-fact fashion as if he 
were going out to an evening party in his dress 
coat. His spirits mounted in the atmosphere of 



 

adventure which the ladies diffused about them in 
the carriage; Effie Bowen laughed aloud when he 
entered, in childish gaiety of heart. 

The narrow streets roared with the wheels of cabs 
and carriages coming and going ; the street before 
the theatre was so packed that it was some time 
before they could reach the door. Masks were pass- 
ing in and out ; the nervous joy of the ladies ex- 
pressed itself in a deep-drawn quivering sigh. Their 
carriage door was opened by a servant of the theatre, 
who wished them a pleasant veglione, and the next 
moment they were in the crowded vestibule, where 
they paused a moment, to let Imogene and Effie 
really feel that they were part of a masquerade. 

" Now, keep all together," said Mrs. Bowen, as 
they passed through the inner door of the vestibule, 
and the brilliantly lighted theatre flashed its colours 
and splendours upon them. The floor of the pit had 
been levelled to that of the stage, which, stripped of 
the scenic apparatus, opened vaster spaces for the 
motley crew already eddying over it in the waltz. 
The boxes, tier over tier, blazed with the light of 
candelabra which added their sparkle to that of the 
gas jets. 

"You and Effie go before, said Mrs. Bowen to 
Imogene. She made them take hands like children, 
and mechanically passed her own hand through Col- 
ville's arm. 

A mask in red from head to foot attached him- 
self to the party, and began to make love to her in 
excellent pantomime. 



 

Colville was annoyed. He asked her if he should 
tell the fellow to take himself off. 

"Not on any account!" she answered. "It's 
perfectly delightful. It wouldn't be the veglione 
without it Did you ever see such good acting ? " 

" I don't think it 's remarkable for anything but 
its fervour," said Colville. 

" I should like to see you making love to some 
lady," she rejoined mischievously. 

" I will make love to you, if you like," he said, 
but he felt in an instant that his joke was in bad 
taste. 

They went the round of the theatre. " That is 
Prince Strozzi, Imogene,'' said Mrs. Bowen, leaning 
forward to whisper to the girl. She pointed out 
other people of historic and aristocratic names in the 
boxes, where there was a democracy of beauty 
among the ladies, all painted and powdered to the 
same marquise effect. 

On the floor were gentlemen in evening dress, 
without masks, and here and there ladies waltzing, 
who had masks but no dominoes. But for the most 
part people were in costume ; the theatre flushed 
and flowered in gay variety of tint that teased the 
eye with its flow through the dance. 

Mrs. Bowen had circumscribed the adventure so 
as to exclude dancing from it. Imogene was not to 
dance. One might go to the vegUone and look on 
from a box ; if one ventured further and went on 
the floor, decidedly one was not to dance. 

This was thoroughly understood beforehand, and 



 

there were to be no petitions or murmurs at the 
theatre. They found a quiet corner, and sat down 
to look on. 

The mask in red followed, and took his place at a 
little distance, where, whenever Mrs. Bowen looked 
that way, he continued to protest his passion. 

"You're sure he doesn't bore joni" suggested 
ColviUe. 

" No, indeed. He 's very amusing." 

" Oh, all right ! " 

The waltz ceased ; the whirling and winding con- 
fusion broke into an irregular streaming hither and 
thither, up and down. They began to pick out 
costumes and characters that interested them. 
Clowns in white, with big noses, and harlequins in 
their motley, with fiat black masks, abounded. 
There were some admirable grasshoppers in green, 
with long antennae quivering from their foreheads. 
Two or three Mephistos reddened through the 
crowd. Several knights in armour got about with 
difficulty, apparently burdened by their greaves and 
breastplates. 

A group of leaping and dancing masks gathered 
around a young man in evening dress, with long 
hair, who stood leaning against a pillar near them, 
and who underwent their mockeries with a smile of 
patience, half amused, half tormented. 

When they grew tired of baiting him, and were 
looking about for other prey, the red mask re- 
doubled his show of devotion to Mrs. Bowen, and 
the other masks began to flock round and approve. 



 

" Oh, now,'' she said, with a little embarrassed > 
laugh, in which there was no displeasure, " I think 
you may ask him to go away. But don't be harsh 
with him," she added, at a brusque movement which 
Colville made toward the mask. 

" Oh, why should I be harsh with him ? We 're 
not rivals." This was not in good taste either, Col- 
ville felt. " Besides, I 'm an Italian too," he said, 
to retrieve himself. He made a few paces toward 
the mask, and said in a low tone, with gentle sug- 
gestion, " Madame finds herself a little incommoded." 

The mask threw himself into an attitude of bur- 
lesque despair, bowed low with his hand on his 
heart, in token of submission, and vanished into 
the crowd. The rest dispersed with cries of ap- 
plause. 

" How very prettily you did it, both of you ! " 
said Mrs. Bowen. " I begin to believe you are an 
Italian, Mr. Colville. I shall be afraid of you." 

"You weren't afraid of him." 

" Oh, he was a real Italian." 

" It seems to me that mamma is getting all the 
good of the -veglione,'' said Effie, in a plaintive mur- 
mur. The well-disciplined child must have suffered 
deeply before she lifted this seditious voice. 

"Why, so I am, Elfie," answered her mother, 
" and I don't think it 's fair myself. What shall we 
do about it ? " 

"I should like something to eat," said the child. 

" So should I," said Colville. " That 's reparation 
your mother owes us all. Let 's make her take us 

and get us something. Wouldn't you like an ice, 
Miss Graham ? " 

"Yes, an ice," said Imogene, with an effect of 
adding, "Nothing more for worlds," that made 
Colville laugh. She rose slowly, like one in a 
dream, and cast a look as impassioned as a look 
could be made through a mask on the scene she was 
leaving behind her. The band was playing a waltz 
again, and the wide floor swam with circling 
couples. 

The corridor where the tables were set was 
thronged with people, who were drinking beer and 
eating cold beef and boned turkey and slices of huge 
round sausages. " Oh, how can they ? " cried the 
girl, shuddering. 

" I didn't know you were so ethereal-minded about 
these things," said Colville. " I thought you didn't 
object to the salad at Madame Uccelli's." 

" Oh, but at the veglione ! " breathed the girl for 
all answer. He laughed again, but Mrs. Bowen did 
not laugh with him ; he wondered why. 

When they returned to their corner in the theatre 
they found a mask in a black domino there, who 
made place for them, and remained standing near. 
They began talking freely and audibly, as English- 
speaking people incorrigibly do in Italy, where their 
tongue is all but the language of the country. 

" Eeally," said Colville, " I think I shall stifle in 
this mask. If you ladies will do what you can to 
surround me and keep me secret, I 'll take it off a 
moment." ' 



 

"I believe I will join you, Mr. Colville," said the 
mask near them. He pushed up his little visor of 
silk, and discovered the mild, benignant features of 
Mr. Waters. 

" Bless my soul ! " cried Colville. 

Mrs. Bowen was apparently too much shocked to 
say anything. 

" You didn't expect to meet me here ? " asked 
the old man, as if otherwise it should be the most 
natural thing in the world. After that they could 
only unite in suppressing their astonishment. "It's 
extremely interesting," he went on, " extremely ! 
I 've been here ever since the exercises began, and 
I have not only been very greatly amused, but 
greatly instructed. It seems to me the key to a 
great many anomalies in the history of this wonder- 
ful people." 

If Mr. Waters took this philosophical tone about 
the Carnival, it was not possible for Colville to take 
any other. 

"And have you been able to divine from what 
you have seen here," he asked gravely, "the grounds 
of Savonarola's objection to the Carnival ? " 

" Not at all," said the old man promptly. " I 
have seen nothing but the most harmless gaiety 
throughout the evening.'' 

Colville hung his head. He remembered reading 
once in a passage from Swedenborg, that the most 
celestial angels had scarcely any power of perceiving 
evil. 

" Why aren't you young people dancing ? " asked 



 

Mr. Waters, in a cheerful general way, of Mrs. 
Bowen's party. 

Colville was glad to break the silence. "Mrs. 
Bowen doesn't approve of dancing at vegliones." 

" No "i — why not ? " inquired the old man, with 
invincible simplicity. 

Mrs. Bowen smiled her pretty, small smile below 
her mask. 

"The company is apt to be rather mixed," she 
said quietly. 

" Yes," pursued Mr. Waters ; " but you could 
dance with one another. The company seems very 
well behaved." 

" Oh, quite so," Mrs. Bowen assented. 

" Shortly after I came," said Mr. Waters, " one of 
the masks asked me to dance. I was really sorry 
that my age and traditions forbade my doing so. I 
tried to explain, but I 'm afraid I didn't make my- 
self quite clear." 

"Probably it passed for a joke with her," said 
Colville, in order to say something. 

" Ah, very likely ; but I shall always feel that my 
impressions of the Carnival would have been more 
definite if I could have danced. Now, if I were a 
young man like you " 

Imogene turned and looked at Colville through 
the eye-holes of her mask; even in that sort of 
isolation he thought her eyes expressed surprise. 

"It never occurred to you before that I was a 
young man," he suggested gravely. 

She did not reply. 



After a little interval, " Imogene," asked Mrs. 
Bowen, "would you like to dance V 

Colville was astonished. " The veglione has gone 
to your head, Mrs. Bower)," he tacitly made his com- 
ment. She had spoken to Imogene, but she glanced 
at him as if she expected him to be grateful to her 
for this stroke of liberality. 

"What would be the use ?" returned the girl. 

Colville rose. " After my performance in the 
Lancers, I can't expect you to believe me ; but I 
really do know how to waltz." He had but to extend 
his arms, and she was hanging upon his shoulder, 
and they were whirling away through a long orbit 
of delight to the girl. 

" Oh, why have you let me do you such injustice ?" 
she murmured intensely. " I never shall forgive 
myself." 

" It grieved me that you shouldn't have divined 
that I was really a magnificent dancer in disguise, 
but I bore it as best I could," said Colville, really 
amused at her seriousness. " Perhaps- ye-u-#nd 
out after a while that lin not an old fellow , either, 
but only a K-ost Youth, r 

" Hush," she said; "Mon't like to hear you talk so." 

"Howf 

"About — age!" she answered. "It makes me 
feel Don't to-night ! " 

Colville laughed. " It isn't a fact that my blink- 
ing is going to change materially. You had better 
make the most of me as a lost youth. I 'm old 
enough to be two of them." 



 

She did not answer, and as they wound up and 
down through the other orbing couples, he remem- 
bered the veglione of seventeen years before, when 
he had dreamed through the waltz with the girl who 
jilted him ; she was very docile and submissive that 
night ; he believed afterward that if he had spoken 
frankly then, she would not have refused him. But 
he had veiled his passion in words and phrases that, 
taken in themselves, had no meaning — that neither 
committed him nor claimed her. He could not help 
it ; he had not the courage at any moment to risk 
the loss of her for ever, till it was too late, till he 
must lose her. 

"Do you believe in pre-existence ? " he demanded 
of Imogene. 

" Oh yes ! " she flashed back. " This very instant 
it was just as if I had been here before, long ago." 

" Dancing with me ? " 

" With you ? Yes— yes— I think so." 

He had lived long enough to know that she was 
making herself believe what she said, and that she 
had not lived long enough to know this. 

" Then you remember what I said to you — tried 
to say to you — that night ? " Through one of those, 
psychological juggles which, we all practise with 
ourselves at times, it amused him, it charmed him, 
to find her striving to realise this past. 

" No ; it was so long ago ? What was it t " she 
whispered dreamily. 

A turn of the waltz brought them near Mrs. 
Bowen ; her mask seemed to wear a dumb reproach. 



 

He began to be weary ; one of the differences be- 
tween youth and later life is that the latter wearies 
so soon of any given emotion. 

" Ah, I can't remember, either ! Aren't you get- 
ting rather tired of the waltz and me ? " 

" Oh no ; go on ! " she deeply murmured. "Try 
to remember." 

The long, pulsating stream of the music broke and 
fell. The dancers crookedly dispersed in wandering 
lines. She took his arm ; he felt her heart leap 
against it ; those innocent, trustful throbs upbraided 
him. At the same time his own heart beat with 
a sort of fond, protecting tenderness  he felt the 
witchery of his power to make this young, radiant, 
and beautiful creature hang flattered and bewildered 
on his talk ; he liked the compassionate worship 
with which his tacit confidence had inspired her, 
even while he was not without some satirical sense 
of the crude sort of heart-broken hero he must be in 
the fancy of a girl of her age. 

" Let us go and walk in the corridor a moment," 
he said. But they walked there till the alluring 
melancholy music of the waltz began again. In a 
mutual caprice, they rejoined the dance. 

It came into his head to ask, " Who is he ? " and 
as he had got past denying himself anything, he 
asked it. 

"He? What he?" 

" He that Mrs. Bowen thought might object to 
your seeing the Carnival ? " 

" Oh ! — oh yes ! That was the not impossible he." 



 

" Is that all ? " 

" Yes." 

" Then lie 's not even the not improbable he ? " 

" No, indeed." 

They waltzed in silence. Then, " Why did you 
ask me that ? " she murmured. 

" I don't know. Was it such a strange question ? " 

" I don't know. You ought to.'' 

"Yes, if it was wrong, I'm old enough to know 
better." 

" You promised not to say ' old ' any more.'' 

" Then I suppose I mustn't. But you mustn't get 
me to ignore it, and then laugh at me for it." 

"Oh!" she reproached him, "you think I could 
do that ? " 

"You could if it was you who were here with me 
once before." 

" Then I know I wasn't." 

Again they were silent, and it was he who spoke 
first. " I wish you would tell me why you object to 
the interdicted topic ? " 

" Because — because I like every time to be perfect 
in itself." 

" Oh ! And this wouldn't be perfect in itself if I 
were — not so young as some people ? " 

" I didn't mean that. No ; but if you didn't men- 
tion it, no one else would think of it or care for it." 

" Did any one ever accuse you of flattering. Miss 
Graham?" 

" Not till now. And you are unjust." 

" Well, I withdraw the accusation." 



 

"And will you ever pretend such a thing 
again ? " 

" Oh, never ! " 

" Then I have your promise." 

The talk was light word-play, such as depends 
upon the talker's own mood for its point or its point- 
lessness. Between two young people of equal years 
it might have had meanings to penetrate, to siglj, 
over, to question. Colville found it delicious to be 
pursued by the ingenuous fervour of this young girl, 
eager to vindicate her sincerity in prohibiting him 
from his own ironical depreciation. Apparently, 
she had a sentimental mission of which he was the 
object ; he was to be convinced that he was unne- 
cessarily morbid; he was to be cheered up, to be 
kept in heart. 

" I must believe in you after this," he said, with a 
smile which his mask hid. 

" Thanks," she breathed. It seemed to him that 
her hand closed convulsively upon his in their light 
clasp. 

The pressure sent a real pang to his heart. It 
forced her name from his lips. " Imogene ! Ah, 
I 've no right to call you that." 

" Yes." 

"From this out I promise to be twenty years 
younger. But no one is to know it but you. Do 
you think you will know it ? I shouldn't like to 
keep the secret to myself altogether." 

" No ; I will help you. It shall be our secret." 

She gave a low laugh of delight. He convinced 



 

himself that she had entered into the light spirit of 
banter in which he believed that he was talking. 

The music ceased again. He whirled her to the 
seat where he had left Mrs. Bowen. She was not 
there, nor the others. 

Colville felt the meanness of a man who has be- 
trayed his trust, and his self-contempt was the 
sharper because the trust had been as tacit and in- 
definite as it was generous. The effect of Mrs. 
Bowen's absence was as if she had indignantly flown, 
and left him to the consequences of his treachery. 

He sat down rather blankly with Imogene to wait 
for her return ; it was the only thing they could do. 

It had grown very hot. The air was thick with 
dust. The lights burned through it as through a 
fog. 

" I believe I will take off my mask," she said. " I 
can scarcely breathe." 

" No, no," protested Colville ; " that won't do." 

" I feel faint," she gasped. 

His heart sank. " Don't," he said incoherently. 
" Come with me into the vestibule, and get a breath 
of air." 

He had almost to drag her through the crowd, 
but in the vestibule she revived, and they returned 
to their place again. He did not share the easy 
content with which she recognised the continued 
absence of Mrs. Bowen. 

"Why they must be lost. But isn't it perfect 
sitting here and watching the maskers ? " 

"Perfect," said Colville distractedly. 



 

"Don't you like to make romances about the dif- 
ferent ones ? " 

It was on Colville's tongue to say that he had 
made all the romances he wished for that .evening, 
but he only answered, " Oh, very." 

" Poor Mrs. Bowen," laughed the girl. " It will 
be such a joke on her, with her punctilious notions, 
getting lost from her protdgde at a Carnival ball ! 
I shall tell every one.'' 

" Oh no, don't," said Colville, in horror that his 
mask scarcely concealed. 

" Why not ? " 

" It wouldn't be at all the thing." 

" Why, are you becoming Europeanised too ? " she 
demanded. " I thought you went in for all sorts of 
unconventionalities. EecoUect your promise. You 
must be as impulsive as I am." 

ColvUle, staring anxiously about in every direction, 
made for the first time the reflection that most young 
girls probably conform to the proprieties without in 
the least knowing why. 

" Do you think," he asked, in desperation, " that 
you would be afraid to be left here a moment while 
I went about in the crowd and tried to find them ? " 

" Not at all," she said. But she added, " Don't 
be gone long." 

" Oh no," he answered, pulling off his mask. " Be 
sure not to move from here on any account.'' 

He plunged into the midst of the crowd that 
buffeted him from side to side as he struck against 
its masses. The squeaking and gibbering masks 



 

mocked in their falsetto at his wild-eyed, nakecj face 
thrusting hither and thither among them. 

"I saw your lady wife with another gentleman,"
