With a gesture, fierce and intolerant, she seized 
the Bible and thrust it out of sight, into the drawer. 
Then, her body still tense with the atoms of anger, 
she sat down upon the edge of the bed and rocked 
from side to side. But shortly this movement 
ceased. The recollection of the forlorn and loveless 
years — stirred into consciousness by the unexpected 
confrontation —  bent her as the high wind bends the 
water-reed. 

"My father!" she whispered. "My own father!" 

Queerly the room and its objects receded and 
vanished; and there intervened a series of mental 
pictures that so long as she Kved would ever be 
recurring. She saw the moonlit waters, the black 
shadow of the proa, the moon-fire that ran down the 
far edge of the bellying sail, the silent natives: no 
sound except the slapping of the outrigger and the 
low sibilant murmur of water falling away from the 
sides —  and the beating of her heart. The fight. 

How she had fought her eagerness in the beginning, 
lest it reveal her ignorance of the marvels of man- 
kind! The terror and ecstasy of that night in 
Singapore —  the first city she had ever seen! There 
was still the impression that something akin to a 
miracle had piloted her successfully from one ordeal 
to another. 

The clerk at the Raffles Hotel had accorded her but 
scant interest. She had, it was true, accepted 
doubtfully the pen he had offered. She had not 



 

been suflSciently prompted in relation to the ways of 
caravansaries; but her mind had been alert and 
receptive. Ahnost at once she had comprehended 
that she was expected to write down her name and 
address, which she did, in slanting cobwebby lettering, perhaps a trifle laboriously. Ruth Enschede, 
Hartford, Conn. The address was of course her 
destination, thousands of miles away, an infinitesimal 
spot in a terrifying space. 

She could visualize the picture she had presented, 
particularly the battered papier-match kitbag at her 
feet. In Europe or in America people would have 
smiled; but in Singapore — the half-way port of the 
world — where a human kaleidoscope tumbles con- 
tinuously east and west, no one had remarked her. 
She would never forget the agony of that first 
meal in the great dining room. She could have 
dined iilone in her room; but courage had demanded 
that she face the ordeal and have done with it. 
Every eye seemed focussed upon her; and yet she had 
known the sensation to be the conceit of her imagination. 

The beautiful gowns and the flashing bare shoulders and arms of the women had disturbed and dis- 
tressed her. Women, she had been taught, who 
exposed the flesh of their bodies under the eyes of 
man were in a special catagory of the damned. 
Almost instantly she had recognized the fallacy of 
such a statement. These women could not be bad. 





else the hotel would not have permitted them to 
enter! Still, the scene presented a riddle: to give 
immunity to the black women who went about all but 
naked and to damn the white for exposing their 
shoulders! 

She had eaten but little; all her hunger had been in 
her eyes —  and in her heart. Loneliness —  something 
that was almost physical: as if the vitaKty had been 
taken out of the air she breathed. The longing to 
talk to someone! But in the end she had gone to 
her room without giving in to the craving. 

Once in the room, the door locked, the sense of 
loneliness had dropped away from her as the mists 
used to drop away from the mountain in the morning. 
Even then she had understood vaguely that she had 
touched upon some philosophy of life: that one was 
never lonely when alone, only in the midst of crowds. 

Another picture slid across her vision. She saw 
herself begin a slow, sinuous dance: and stop suddenly in the middle of a figure, conscious that the 
dance was not impromptu, her own, but native — 
the same dance she had quitted but a few minutes 
gone. She had fallen into it naturally, the only 
expression of the dance she had ever seen or known, 
and that a stolen sweet. That was odd : when young 
people were joyous, they had to express it physically. 
But native ! She must watch out. 

She remembered that she had not gone to bed 
until two o'clock in the morning. She had carried a 




 

chair into the room veranda and had watched and 
listened until the night silences had lengthened and 
only occasionally she heard a voice or the rattle of 
rickshaw wheels in the courtyard. 

The great ordeal —  that which she had most 
dreaded —  had proved to be no ordeal at all. The 
kindly American consul-general had himself taken 
her to the bank, where her banknotes had been ex- 
changed for a letter of credit, and had thoroughly 
advised her. Everything had so far come to pass as 
the withered old Kanaka woman had foretold. 

"The Golden One knows that I have seen the 

world; therefore follow my instructions. Never 

glance sideways at man. Nothing else matters." 

The prison bars of circumstance, they no longer 

encompassed her. Her wings were oddly weak, but 

for all that she could fly. That was the glorious if 

bewildering truth. She had left for ever the cage, 

the galling leash : she was free. The misty caravans 

of which she had dreamed were become actualities. 

She had but to choose. All about her, hither and 

yon, lay the enticing Unknown. Romance! The 

romance of passing faces, of wires that carried voices 

and words to the far ends of the world, of tremendous 

mechanisms that propelled ships and trains! And, 

oh the beautiful books ! 

She swiftly knelt upon the floor and once more 
gathered the books to her heart. 



CHAPTER V 

AT DINNER the spinsters invited Ruth to sit 
at their table, an invitation she accepted 
JLL gratefully. She was not afraid exauctly, but 
there was that about her loneliness to-night she distrusted. Detached, it was not impossible that she 
would be forced to leave the dining room because of 
invading tears. To be near someone, even someone 
who made a pretense of friendliness, to hear voices, 
her own intermingling, would serve as a rehabilitating tonic. The world had grown dark and wide, and 
she was very small. Doubts began to rise up all 
about her, plucking at her confidence. Could she 
go through with it? She must. She would never, 
never go back. 

As usual the substantive sister —  Prudence — did all 
the talking for the pair; Angelina, the shadow, 
offered only her submitting nods. Sometimes she 
missed her cue and nodded aflSrmatively when the 
gesture should have been the reverse; and Prudence 
would send her a sharp glance of disapproval. 
Angelina's distress over these mischances was 
pathetic. 

None of this by-play escaped Ruth, whose sense of 
humour needed no developing. That she possessed 

 



 

any sense of humour was in itself one of those human 
Tniracles which metaphysicians are always pothering 
over without arriving anywhere; for her previous 
environment had been particularly humourless. But 
if she smiled at all it was with her eyes. To-night 
she could have hugged both the old maids. 

"Somebody ought to get hold of that young man ' 
said Prudence, grimly, as she nodded in Spurlock's 
direction. " Look at him ! '' 

Ruth looked. He was draining a glass, and as he 
set it down he shuddered. A siphon and a whisky 
bottle stood before him. He measured out the 
portion of another peg, the bottle wavering in his 
hand. His food lay untouched about his plate. 
There was no disgust in Ruth's heart, only an infinite 
pity; for only the pitiful understand. 
"I'm sorry," she said. 

"I have no sympathy," replied Prudence, "with a 
man who deliberately fuddles himself with strong 
drink." 

"You would, if you had seen what I have. Men in 
this part of the world drink to forget the things they 
have lost." 

"And what should a young man like this one have 
to forget?" Prudence demanded to know. 

"I wonder," said Ruth. "Couldn't you speak to 
him?" 

"What? —  and be insulted for my trouble? No, 
thank you ! " 





" That is it. You complain of a condition, but you 
leave the correction to someone else." 

The spinster had no retort to oflFer such directness. 
This child was frequently disconcerting. Prudence 
attacked her chicken wing. 

"I spoke to him, my interest might be mis- 
interpreted." 

"Where did you go to school?" Prudence asked, 
seeking a new channel, for the old one appeared to be 
full of hidden reefs. 

"I never went to school." 

"But you are educated!" — astonished. 

" That depends upon what you call educated. Still, 
my tutor was a highly educated scholar —  my father.'' 
Neither spinster noticed the reluctance in the tones. 

"Ah! I see. He suddenly realized that he could 
not keep you for ever in this part of the world; so he 
sends you to your aunt. That dress ! Only a man — 
and an imworldly one —  would have permitted you to 
proceed on your adventure dressed in a gown thirty 
years out of date. What is your father's business?" 

The question was an impertinence, but Ruth was 
not aware of that. 

"Souls," she answered, drily. 

"A missioner! That illuminates everything." 
The spinster's face actually became warm. "You 
will finish your education in the East and return. I 



see. 



"No. I shall never come back. 



 



 

Something in the child's voice, something in her 
manner, warned the spinster that her well-meaning 
inquisitiveness had received a set-back and that it 
would be dangerous to press it forward again. What 
she had termed illuminative now appeared to be only 
another phase of the mystery which enveloped the 
child. A sinister thought edged in. Who could 
say that the girl's father had not once been a fashionable clergyman in the States and that drink had got 
him and forced him down, step by step, until —  to use 
the child's odd expression —  he had come upon the 
beach? She was cynical, this spinster. There was 
no such a thing as perfection in a mixed world. 
Clergymen were human. Still, it was rather terrible 
to suspect that one had fallen from grace, but nevertheless the thing was possible. With the last glim- 
mer of decency he had sent the daughter to his sister. 
The poor child! What frightful things she must 
have seen on that island of hers ! 

The noise of crashing glass caused a diversion; and 
Ruth turned gratefully toward the sound. 

The young man had knocked over the siphon. He 
rose, steadied himself , then walked out of the dining 
room. Except for the dull eyes and the extreme 
pallor of his face, there was nothing else to indicate 
that he was deep in liquor. He did not stagger in the 
least. And in this fact lay his danger. The man who 
staggers, whose face is flushed, whose attitude is 
either noisily friendly or truculent, has some chance; 





liquor bends him eventually. But men of the 
Spurlock type, who walk straight, who are unobtrusive and intensely pale, they break swiftly and 
inexplicably. They seldom arrive on the beack 
There are way-stations — even terminals. 

There was still the pity of understanding in Ruth's 
eyes. Perhaps it was loneliness. Perhaps he had 
lost his loved ones and was wandering over the world 
seeking forgetfulness. But he would die if he continued in this course. They were alike in one phase 
—  loveless and lonely. K he died, here in this hotel, 
who would care? Or if she died, who would care? 

A queer desire blossomed in her heart: to go to 
him, urge him to see the folly of trying to forget. 
Of what use was the temporary set-back to memory, 
when it always returned with redoubled poignancy? 

Then came another thought, astonishing. This 
was the first young man who had drawn from her 
something more than speculative interest. True, on 
board the ships she had watched young men from 
afar, but only with that normal curiosity which is 
aroused in the presence of any new species. But 
after Singapore she found herself enduing them with 
the characteristics of the heroes in the novels she had 
just read for the first time. This one was Henry 
Esmond, that one the melancholy Marius, and so 
forth and so on; never any villains. It wasn't 
worth while to invest imaginatively a man with evil 
projects simply because he was physically ugly. 



 

Some day she wanted to be loved as Marius loved 
Cosette; but there was another character which bit 
Ear more deeply into her mind. Why? Because she 
knew him in life, because, so long as she could remember, he had crossed and recrossed her vision — 
Sidney Carton. The wastrel, the ne'er-do-well, who 
went mostly nobly to a fine end. 

Here, then, but for the time and place, might be 
another Sidney Carton. Given the proper incentive, 
who could say that he might not likewise go nobly 
to some fine end? She thrilled. To find the incentive! But how? Thither and yon the idea roved, 
seeking the way. But always this new phase in life 
which civilization called convention threw up barrier 
alter barrier. 

She could not go to him with a preachment against 
strong drink; she knew from experience that such a 
plan would be wasted effort. Had she not seen them 
go forth with tracts in their pockets and grins in their 
beards? To set fire to his imagination, to sting his 
sense of chivalry into being, to awaken his manhood, 
she must present some irresistible project. She re- 
called that day of the typhoon and the sloop crashing 
on the outer reefs. The heroism of two beach com- 
bers had saved all on board and their own manhood 
as well. 

"Are you returning to Hong-Kong to-morrow by 
the day boat? '' 
For a moment Ruth was astonished at the sound 





of the spinster's voice. She had, by the magic of recollection, set the picture of the typhoon between 
herself and her table companions: the terrible rollers 
thundering on the white shore, the deafening bellow 
of the wind, the bending and snapping palms, the 
thatches of the native huts scattering inland, the bhr 
of sand dust, and those two outcasts defying the elements. 

''I don't know," she answered vaguely. 

"But there's nothing more to see in Canton.'' 

"Perhaps I'm too tired to plan for to-morrow. 
Those awful chairs ! '' 

After dinner the spinsters proceeded to inscribe 
their accustomed quota of postcards, and Ruth was 
left to herself. She walked through the office to the 
door, aimlessly. 

Beyond the steps was a pole-chair in readiness. 
One of the coolies held the paper lantern. Near by 
stood Ah Cum and the young unknown, the former 
protesting gently, the latter insistent upon his demands. 

"I repeat," said Ah Cum, "that the venture is not 
propitious. Canton is all China at night. If we 
were set upon I could not defend you. But I can 
easily bring in a sing-song girl to play for you." 

"No. I want to make my own selection.'' 

"Very well, sir. But if you have considerable 
money, you had better leave it in the office safe. 
You can pay me when we return. The sing-song 



 

girls in Hong-Kong are far handsomer. That is a 
part of the show in Hong-Kong. But here it is 
China." 

"you will not take me, I'll find some guide who 
will." 

" I will take you. I simply warn you.'' 
Spurlock entered the oflSce, passed Ruth without 
observing her (or if he did observe her, failed to 
recognize her), and deposited his funds with the 
manager. 

"I advise you against this trip, Mr. Taber," said 
the manager.    Affairs are not normal in Canton at 
present. Only a few weeks ago there was a bloody 
battle on the bridge there between the soldiery and 
the local police. Look at these walls." 

The walls were covered with racks of loaded rifles. 
In those revolutionary times one had to be prepared. 
Some Chinaman might take it into his head to shout: 
"Death to the foreign devils!" And out of that wall 
yonder would boil battle and murder and sudden 
death. A white man, wandering about the streets 
of Canton at night, was a challenge to such a catastrophe. 

Taber. Ruth stared thoughtfully at the waiting 
coolies. That did not sound like the name the 
young man had offered in the tower of the water- 
clock. She remained by the door until the walls of 
the city swallowed the bobbing lantern. Then she 
went into the office. 





"What is a sing-song girl? " she asked. 

The manager twisted his moustache. "The same 
as a Japanese geisha girl." 

"And what is a geisha girl?" 

Not to have heard of the geisha! It was as if she 
had asked : "What is Paris? " What manner of tourist was this who had heard neither of the geisha 
of Japan nor of the sing-song girl of China? Befoie 
he could marshal the necessary phrases to explain, 
Ruth herself indicated her thought. 

"A bad girl?" She put the question as she would 
have put any question — level-eyed and level-toned. 

After a series of mental gymnastics — occupying 
the space of a few seconds — it came to hina with a 
shock that here was a new specimen of the species. 
At the same time he comprehended that she was as 
pure and lovely as the white orchid of Borneo and 
that she did not carry that ridiculous shield called 
false modesty. He could talk to her as frankly as he 
could to a man, that she would not take o£Pence at 
anything so long as it was in the form of explanation. 
On the other hand» there was a subconscious impression that she would be able to read instantly anything unclean in a man's eye. All her questions 
would have as a background the idea of future defence. 

"The geisha and the sing-song girl are professional 
entertainers. They are not bad girls, but the 
average tourist has that misconception of them. If 



 

 one of them are bad in the sense you mean, it is beause there are bad folks in all walks of life. They 
sell only their talents, not their bodies; they are not 
girls of the street." 

The phrase was new, but Ruth nodded understand- 
ingly. 

'' Still," went on the manager, "they are slaves in 
a sense; they are bought and sold until their original 
indebtedness is paid. A father is in debt, we'll say. 
He sells his daughter to a geisha or a sing-song master, and the girl is rented out until the debt is paid. 
Then the work is optional; they go on their own. 
There are sing-song girls in Hong-Kong and Shanghai 
who are famous and wealthy. Sometimes they marry 
well. If they become bad it is through inclination, 
not necessity." 

Again Ruth nodded. 

"To go a little further. Morality is a point of 
view. It is an Occidental point of view. The 
Oriental has no equivalent. What you would look 
upon as inmiorality is here merely an established 
custom, three thousand years older than Christianity, accepted with no more ado than that which would 
accompany you should you become a clerk in a shop." 
"That is what I wanted to know," said Ruth 
gravely. " The poor things ! " 

The manager laughed. "Your sytnpathy is being 
wasted. They are the only happy women in the 
Orient." 





"Do you suppose he knew?'' 

"He? Oh, you mean Mr. Taber?'' He wondered 
if this crystal being was interested in that blundering 
fool who had gone recklessly into the city. ''I don't 
know what his idea was." 

"Will there be any danger?" 

"To Mr. Taber? There is a possibility. Canton 
at night is as much China as the border town of Lan- 
Chow-fu. A white man takes his life in his hands. 
But Ah Cum is widely known for his luck. Besides ' 
he added cynically, "it is said that God watches over 
fools and drunken men." 

This expression was old in Ruth's ears. She had 
heard the trader utter it many times. 

"Thank you," she said, and left the office. 

The manager stared at the empty doorway for a 
space, shrugged, and returned to his ledgers. The uncanny directness of those gray eyes, the absence of 
diffidence, the beauty of the face in profile (full, it 
seemed a httle too broad to make for perfect beauty), 
the mellow voice that came full and free, without 
hesitance, all combined to mark her as the most 
unusual young woman he had ever met. He was 
certain that those Kps of hers had never known 
the natural and pardonable simper of youth. 

Was she interested in that young ass who was 
risking his bones over there in the city? They had 
come up on the same boat. Still, one never could 
tell. The young fellow was almost as odd in his way 



 

the girl was in hers. He seldom spoke> and drank 

 with a persistence that was sinister. He was never 

drunk in the accepted meaning of the word; rather 
 walked in a kind of stupefaction. Supposing Ah 

Cum's luck failed for once? 

The manager made a gesture of dismissal, and 
added up the bill for the Misses Jedson, who were 
iretuming to Hong-Kong in the morning. 



CHAPTER VI 

SroNEY CARTON, thought Ruth, in pw-l 
suit of a sing-song girl! The idea was so' 
incongruous that a cold little smile parted 
her lips. It seemed as if each time her imaginatioD 
reached out investingly, an invisible lash beat it 
back. Still, she knew instinctively that all of 
Sidney Carton's life had not been put upon the 
printed page. But to go courting a slave-girl, at the 
risk of physical hurt ! A shudder of distaste wrinkled 
her shoulders. 

She opened the window, for the night was mild, 
and sat on the floor with her chin resting upon the 
window-sill. Even the stars were strangers. Where 
was this kindly world she had drawn so rosily in 
fancy? Disillusion everywhere. The spinsters were 
not kind; they were only curious because she was 
odd and wore a dress thirty years out of date. Later, 
when they returned home, she would serve as the 
topic of many conversations. Ev ybody looked 
askance at everybody else. To escape one phase of 
lonehness she had plunged into another, so vast that 
her courage sometimes faltered. 

She recalled how she had stretched out her arms 
toward the magic blue horizon. Just beyond there 

 



 

ircyuld be her heart's desire. , And in these crowded 
bur "vireeks, what had she learned? That all horizons "virere lies : that smiles and handshakes and good- 
byes and welcomes were lies: that there were really 
no to-morrows, only a treadmill of to-days: and that 
out of these lies and mirages she had plucked a bitter truth — she was alone. 

She turned her cheek to the cold sill; and by and 
by the sill grew warm and wet with tears. She 
"viranted to stay where she was; but tears were dangerous; the more she wept, the weaker she would 
become defensively. She rose briskly, turned on the 
light, and opened Les Miserables to the episode of 
the dark forest: where Jean Valjean reaches out and 
takes Cosette's frightful pail from her chapped little 
hands. 

There must be persons tender and loving in this 
world. There must be real Valjeans, else how could 
authors write about them? Supposing some day 
she met one of these astonishing creators, who could 
make one cry and lau  and forget, who could thrill 
one with love and anger and tenderness? 

Most of us have witnessed carnivals. Here are 
all our harlequins and columbines of the spoken 
and written drama. They flash to and fro, they 
thrill us with expectancy. Then, presto! What a 
dreary lot they are when the revellers lay aside the 
motley! 
Ruth had come from a far South Sea isle. The 


world had not passed by but had gone around it in 
tremendous half-circle. Many things were on  
words, sounds; she could not construct these words
and sounds into objects; or» if she did, invariably 
missed the mark. Her education was remarkable 
in that it was overdeveloped here and underdeveloped 
there: the woman of thirty and the child of ten were 
always getting in each other's way. Until she had 
left her island, what she heard and what she saw 
were truths. And now she was discovering that eva 
Nature was something of a har, with her mirages and 
her horizons. 

At the present moment she was living in a world 
of her own creation, a carnival of brave men and 
fair women, characters out of the tales she had so 
newly read for the first time. She could not resist 
enduing persons she met with the noble attributes of 
the fictional characters. We all did that in our youth, 
when first we came upon a fine story; else we were 
worthless metal indeed. So, step by step, and hurt 
by hurt, Ruth was learning that John Smith was 
John Smith and nobody else. 

Presently she was again in that dreadful tavern of 
the Th6nardiers. That was the wonder of these 
stories; one Hved in them. Cosette sat under the 
table, still as a mouse, fondling her pitiful doll. Dolls. 
Ruth's gaze wandered from the printed page. She 
had never had a real doll. Instinct had forced her to 
create something out of rags to satisfy a mysterious 



 

ci-Aving. But a doll that rolled its eyes and had 
Q.a en hair! Except for the manual labour —  there 
h.£ul been natives to fetch and carry — she and Cosette 
Tv ere sisters in loneliness. 

Perhaps an hoiu' passed before she laid aside the 
book. A bobbing lantern, crossing the bridge —  for 
slie had not drawn the curtain —  attracted her attention. She turned oflf the Kght and approached the 
i?vindow. She saw a pole-chair; that would be this 
IMx. Taber returning. Evidently Ah Cum's luck had 
held good. 

As she stared her eyes grew accustomed to the 
rdght; and she discovered five persons instead of four. 
She remembered Taber's hat. (What was the name 
he had given her that day?) He was walking beside 
the chair upon which appeared to be a bundle of 
colours. She could not see clearly. All at once her 
heart began to patter queerly. He was bringing the 
sing-song girl to the hotel ! 

The strange cort e presently vanished below the 
window-sill. Curiosity to see what a sing-song girl 
was like took possession of Ruth's thoughts. She 
fought the incHnation for a while, then surrendered. 
She was still fully dressed; so all she had to do was to 
pause before the mirror and give her hair a few pats. 
Mirrors. Prior to the great adventure, her mirrors had been the still pools in the rocks after the ebb. 
She had never been able to discover where her father 
had hidden his shaving mirror. 








When she entered the office a strange scene was 
presented to her startled gaze. The sing-song girl, 
her fiddle broken, was beating her forehead upon the 
floor and wailing: Ai  ail Aiy ail Spurlock — or 
Taber, as he called himself — sat slumped in a chair, 
staring with glazed eyes at nothing, absolutely un- 
interested in the confusion for which he was primar- 
ily accountable. The hotel manager was expostulat- 
ing and Ah Cum was replying by a series of 
expressive shrugs. 

What has happened? " Ruth asked. 
A drunken idea," said Ah Cum, taking his hands 
out of his sleeves. "I could not make him under- 
stand." 

"She cannot stay here," the manager de- 
clared. 

"Why does she weep? " Ruth wanted to know. 

Ah Cum explained. "She considers her future 
blasted beyond hope. Mr. Taber did not leave all his 
money in the office. He insisted on buying this girl 
for two hundred mex. He now tells her that she is 
free, no longer a slave. She doesn't understand; she 
believes he has taken a sudden dislike to her. Free, 
there is nothing left to her but the canal. Until two 
hours ago she was as contented and as happy as a 
linnet. If she returns to the house from which we 
took her, her companions will laugh at her and 
smother her with ridicule. On this side of the canal 
she has no place to go. Her people live in Heng- 



 

Chow, in the Hu-nan province. It is all very complex. It is the old story of a Westerner meddling 
with an Eastern custom.'' 

"But why didn't you oppose him?'' 

"I had to let him have his way, else he might not 
have returned safely. One cannot successfully argue 
with a drunken man." 

The object of this discussion sat motionless. The 
voices went into his ears but left no impression of 
their import. There was, in fact, only one clear 
thought in his fevered brain: he had reached the 
hotel without falling down. 

The sing-song girl, seeing Ruth, extended her 
hands and began to chatter rapidly. Ruth made a 
little gesture, of infinite pity; and this was quickly 
seized upon by the slant-eyed Chinese girl. She 
crawled over and caught at the skirts of this white 
woman who understood. 

"What is she saying to me?" 

Ah Cum shrugged. 

Ruth stared into the painted face, now sundrily 
cracked by the coursing tears. "But she is saying 
something to me ! What is it? " 

The hotel manager, who spoke Cantonese with 
facility, interpreted. He knew that he could translate hterally . " She is saying that you, a woman, will 
readily understand the position in which she finds 
herself. She addresses you as the Flower of the 
Lotus, as the Resplendent Moonbeam." 





"Just to give her her freedom?'' said Ruth, turning to Ah Cum. 

"Precisely. The chair is in the veranda. I will 
take her back. But of course the money will not be 
refunded. 

"Then take her back," said the manager. "You 
knew better than to bring her here under the circumstances." 

"Well," said Ah Cum, amiably, "when I argued 
against the venture, he threatened to go wandering 
about alone, I was most concerned in bringing him 
back unhurt." 

He then spoke authoritatively to the girl. He ap- 
peared to thunder dire happenings if she did not 
obey him without further ado. He picked up the 
broken fiddle and beckoned. The sing-song girl rose 
and meekly pattered out of the office into the night. 

Ruth crossed over to the dramatist of this tragi- 
comedy and put a hand on his shoulder. 

"I understand," she said. Her faith in human 
beings revived. "You tried to do something that 
was fine, and . . . and ci\dhzation would not 
let you." 

Spurlock turned his dull eyes and tried to focus 
hers. Suddenly he burst into wild laughter; but 
equally as suddenly something strangled the sound in 
his throat. He reached out a hand gropingly, sagged, 
and toppled out of the chair to the floor, where he 
lay very still. 



CHAPTER Vn 

THE astonishing collapse of Spurlock created 
a tableau of short duration. Then the hotel 





manager struck his palms together sharply, 
and two Chinese "boys" came pattering in from the 
dining room. With a gesture which was without 
any kind of emotional expression, the manager indicated the silent crumpled figure on the floor and 
gave the room number. The Chinamen raised the 
limp body and carried it to the hall staircase, up which 
they mounted laboriously. 

"A doctor at once!'' cried Ruth excitedly. 

"A doctor? What he needs is a good jolt of aro- 
matic spirits of ammonia. I can get that at the bar ' 
the manager said, curtly. He was not particularly 
grateful for the present situation. 

"I warn you, if you do not send for a doctor im- 
mediately, you will have cause to regret it," Ruth 
declared vigorously. "Something more than whisky 
did that. Why did you let him have it? " 

"Let him have it? I can't stand at the elbow 
of any of the guests and regulate his or her ac- 
tions. So long as a man behaves himself, I can't 
refuse him liquor. But I'll call a doctor, since 
you order it. You'll be wasting his time. It is 

 





a plain case of alcoholic stupor. IVe seen many 
cases like it." 

He summoned another ''boy" and rumbled some 
Cantonese. Immediately the "boy'' went forth 
with his paper lantern, repeating a cry as he ran — 
a warning to clear the way.
