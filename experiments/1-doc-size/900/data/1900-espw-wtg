Instead of a broken neck I have a cured leg.
I’m a lucky fellow--as usual. (Laughs
lightly; turns to examine the condition of
the ruined buggy; suddenly looks confused,
and puts his hand to his head.) Curious
cerebral symptoms I have! Queer, there isn’t
a crowd round. They must have missed the
trail when Donna bolted. She’ll be at the
stable by this time.--She won’t go home.
Helen won’t know.... I shouldn’t like to
be the man that had to tell Helen!... I
must get to her--I must get home as soon
as I’ve been to the Hospital. I’m afraid I
was a little short with Helen. I wish-- (Presses
both hands to his temples as if to
command himself; looks more and more
bewildered.) I must have been pretty well
stunned--seems to me there was a collision.
I ran down somebody. It was a landau--we
crashed--I saw it overturn--there
were people in it I knew--patients....
Who?... Who? (Stamps the pavement
peremptorily, and impatiently strikes his
own head.) Who was it?--Horrible! The
brain cells do not obey me--me! (Walks
about frenziedly.) ... Ach--ch! It is
worse to remember than to forget. I have
it now--the sweetest woman of them all--Helen’s
friend--the gentlest, the most obedient,
most trustful, the bravest patient I ever
had--Mrs. Fayth. I saw her face as the carriage
went over.... She stretched out her
hands, and said: “Doctor!” It was Mary
Fayth. (His face falls into his hands.
For a moment he sinks down on the wreck of
the buggy; but springs up.) Now that accounts
for it.--The crowd are all there. The
accident was so bad nobody has thought of
me. She is the victim. I have escaped.
Dead or alive, she is done for. She never
could recover from a shock like that. I
must go and find her. I must find Mrs.
Fayth. (Starts and hurriedly walks down
the street, peering everywhere.)

       [Exit DR. THORNE.

(In his absence no person passes the street.)

       Re-enter DR. THORNE.

Strange! How strange! I cannot find her. I cannot find anything--nor
anybody that a man would naturally meet under such circumstances. Not a
trace of the accident--yet I’m as sure of it as I am that I’m alive.
(Pronounces these words slowly, and paces the sidewalk, irresolute.)
It all came from my being overdue at the Hospital. I suppose I did drive
Donna pretty fast. I wonder if I struck her? I am always in such an
infernal hurry--I never have had time to live. I am driven to death.
(He says the last five words, not impatiently, but with a certain
solemn deliberation.) I must go at once to Mrs. Fayth’s house. They
must have carried Mary there--I wish I could spare time to see
Helen!--I’ll go right home as soon as I’ve been to Fayth’s. Odd! How
these brain symptoms last. I must have had quite a blow. I don’t--I
can’t--it is mortifying to feel so confused.

       [Exit DR. THORNE.

(In his absence the street remains deserted.)

Re-enter DR. THORNE.

Enter behind him a tall Woman. (She is
wrapped in a long ash-colored veil, or
mantle, beneath which shows a gleaming
gown of flame-color. She follows
DR. THORNE silently. She keeps at a
distance from him. Her step is a gliding,
stealthy one. The Woman does
not speak.)

DR. THORNE. There must be serious cerebral congestion. I cannot find the
street. I cannot find Fayth’s house. What part of this bewitched town am
I in? I have lost my way--I, Esmerald Thorne, with a clientele of twenty
years from end to end of the city--I cannot find my way.

Enter a Suburban, a Loafer, and a
Priest. (The Woman draws her veil,
and looks solemnly at DR. THORNE
as she passes. Her face is pale and
wretched, but possesses singular
beauty.)

       [Exit the Woman.

(DR. THORNE does not notice the Woman.)

(The Loafer leans against a post. He stares stupidly at the wreck.)

(The Priest walks slowly, reciting an Ave.)

(The Suburban hurries on, making a wide circle to avoid the ruins of
the carriage.)

DR. THORNE (addressing the Suburban). Can you tell me?--Here! Hold on
a minute! Man, can’t you answer a civil question? Will you tell me--

THE SUBURBAN (pays no attention to DR. THORNE, but hurries on.
Consults his watch; speaks.) I shall lose my train!

       [Exit Suburban, running.

DR. THORNE (with puzzled impatience, addressing the Loafer).
Here!--You! Why, it’s Jerry! Just tell me, will you, Jerry, where the
accident was, and how much was the lady hurt?

(The Loafer stares stupidly at DR. THORNE, but makes no answer.)

       [Exit Loafer.

DR. THORNE (with trouble on his face, more gently addresses the
Priest, whom he slightly touches on the arm). Sir!--Oh, Father
Sullivan! Look here, Father! I’m ashamed to confess, I have lost my way.
Would you direct me to the house of the well-known merchant, Frederick
Fayth? I am due there on an urgent professional errand, and--I cannot
explain the phenomenon--but I have lost my way!

(The Priest repeats an Ave under his breath. He looks DR. THORNE
full in the face, but does not reply.)

DR. THORNE. And will you be so kind as to tell me whether you have heard
of a carriage accident down-town--and how much was the lady hurt? Did
you--

PRIEST(looks blindly over DR. THORNE’S head; mutters). Nay--Nay. I
see nothing. (He crosses himself). Ave Sanctissima! Ora pro nobis!
(He lifts his arms and, with a troubled and confused expression, makes
the sign of the cross in the air over DR. THORNE. Priest passes on.)

DR. THORNE (gently). Thank you, Father.

       [Exit Priest.

DR. THORNE (stands sunken in thought for a few moments; suddenly starts
and knots his hands together, then separates them with the motion of one
blind or of one feeling his way in the dark). I must see Helen! I must
go to Helen!--Helen! Helen!

(Sudden darkness settles. When it passes, the wreck of the buggy is
removed.)

Enter DR. THORNE. (Walks rapidly and
perplexedly, still with the manner of a
man who has lost his way.)

       [Exit.


Re-enter.

       [Exit.

Re-enter (speaks).

I must get home. I will get home. I will see Helen! (Stops
sharply, as if smitten by an unseen force; cannot take another step;
contends, as if with an invisible power; droops, as if vanquished;
turns, and retraces his way; his head hangs to his breast. He speaks.)
What thwarts me from my home? Who constrains me from my wife?
(Lifts his face angrily to the sky.) Is this hypnotism? (Laughs
sarcastically.) Am I an infant--or a maniac? It must be anæsthesia
passing off. Perhaps I was etherized by some blank fool after that
shock.--The accident! That is it, of course, of course! It is the
cerebral concussion--a simple case.... I shouldn’t like this to get out.
I believe I’ll go into my office--if I can find my office--and wait till
this passes off. It is a perfectly simple case. (Walks feverishly up
and down the street, searching for his own office; mutters.) Ever since
I yielded to that demand for a noon office hour downtown for business
men--it has crowded me without mercy. If they hadn’t been my old
patients, I wouldn’t have succumbed to it. It’s just another strand in
the whiplash that has driven me to death. Well (draws a long
breath)--I seem to be out of sorts to-night. I shall get over all this
nonsense when I see Helen. Helen will set me right. Helen will make a
live man of me again.


END OF SCENE II.


SCENE III.

The interior of a down-town office. DR. THORNE
is seen in the consulting room; the door is closed into
the reception room. One gas-jet burns over the desk;
patient’s chair and physician’s chair are seen in the
usual places; the desk is in order for the night; a
movable telephone, of the kind in use in offices, stands
upon the desk.

DR. THORNE (throws himself heavily
into his revolving chair). What the devil
am I here for? (Violently. The light
grows dim as he says this.) Why in--why
in the name of all the laws of Nature
cannot I get home? (After a pause, brokenly.)
Well--well! It’s something to
be here; to get out of the street--in out
of the night--it’s a good deal. I’d begun
to understand how outcasts feel--felons,
apparitions, fugitives. In the name of the
laws of mystery, thank Heaven for so much!
(The light brightens. It reveals his face,
which is haggard and pinched. He pushes
his case books about, aimlessly. Suddenly
his hand hits the receiver of the telephone.
He springs and cries out:) The telephone!
The telephone! I must have gone stark
mad not to think of it.--See! I’m not a
drinking man, am I? (Puts his hand to
his head.) No. I do not drink. Helen
would not like to have me.--No. And
I’ve been all these hours without telephoning
to Helen. She’ll think I did it on purpose--poor
Helen--because of the words
I said. If a man could slay the words he
says.... They harry me--like ghosts.
(Rings the telephone violently.) Central?
48.4--48.4, I say. Why don’t you give
me 48.4? I tell you I’m in a hurry. 48.4!
And be quick with it! (Rings again.) Why
in--why don’t you attend to your business
there? It is Dr. Thorne--Dr. Esmerald
Thorne. My errand is most urgent. Give
me my home, and make short work of it.
48.4! Do you hear? (Rings again.)

(A MAN’S VOICE FROM THE EXCHANGE
comes faintly over the wire, reverberating
through the transmitter, so as to be audible
at a distance from the instrument.) Why
don’t you speak? We cannot make out a
word you say.

DR. THORNE (rings again, wildly). I
tell you I want my home--48.4! I must
speak to my wife. Give me 48.4--Helen?
Helen!

VOICE FROM THE TELEPHONE. Stop
ringing your bell if you can’t use your
tongue. Put your mouth close to the transmitter.
Are you drunk? Or are you dead?

DR. THORNE (still ringing). I will report
you for this. It shall cost you your
place. 48.4, I say. Give me my house.
I will not submit to this. Give me 48.4!

(The telephone ceases to reply.)

DR. THORNE (rises, hangs up the receiver,
and paces the office tempestuously;
speaks). The very forces of Nature are in
league against me.... My own nervous
system--the night--the atmosphere--electricity--they
are all gone foes to me.
They are serried like an army between myself
and her. Helen will be--Helen will
suffer--oh, poor girl!

(The telephone call bell rings suddenly.)

DR. THORNE (leaping to the receiver).
Who calls? I am here. Who wants Dr.
Thorne? (He snatches the receiver greedily
to his ear; listens a moment; cries
wildly:) Oh, Helen! Is that you, dear?
Speak louder, darling.... Yes, I’m
here--at my office down-town. I’ll be
home soon. Don’t be frightened--but I
met with a trifling accident. Helen? Helen!
What’s the trouble? Don’t you hear me,
Helen?

WOMAN’S VOICE FROM THE TELEPHONE.
Is my husband there? Esmerald! Are
you there?

DR. THORNE. Why, Helen! Don’t you
hear me? What does ail this cursed telephone?
Central! Give me a decent wire.
My wife can’t hear a word I say....
Helen? I’m not at all hurt--only shaken
up a little. I’ll get back just as soon as--Helen?
Helen!

WOMAN’S VOICE FROM THE TRANSMITTER.
Central? I cannot find my husband at his
office. Please give me the Hospital.--I
must communicate with my husband.

(VOICE FROM THE TRANSMITTER dies
away.)

DR. THORNE (rings madly). Central,
you’ve cut me off! You’ve cut me off
from my home. Give me 48.4 again.
Helen?--Helen! Can’t you hear me?
Don’t you understand me, Helen? Oh, I
could hear you--your own dear voice, my
girl! I wanted to tell you--I can’t wait
till I see you to say--Helen? She does
not hear me.--Helen!

(The transmitter is silent.)

(DR. THORNE lays the receiver down. He
hides his face in his hands.)


END OF SCENE III.


SCENE IV.

Morning in a business street down-town. Many
people are passing, among them the PRIEST, the SUBURBAN,
and the LOAFER. A crowd thickens before
the bulletin boards of “The Earth,” a prominent daily
newspaper. At the extreme left are the headquarters
of “The Universe,” a rival paper. Not far from
“The Earth” building can be seen the modest sign
of the eminent physician:--

+------------------------------------+
|      DR. ESMERALD THORNE.          |
| OFFICE HOUR 12-1 O’CLOCK. |
+------------------------------------+

(A door opens within. DR. THORNE appears in the entrance to the
corridor.)

Enter DR. THORNE (upon the sidewalk.
Standing irresolute, he seems to wince
from the daylight and the morning
air; he mutters).

Now it is light, I can find my way to Helen. (Steps slowly along the
sidewalk; shades his eyes from the sun. He wears no hat, and his pallor
has increased. No person addresses him.)

(On the bulletin boards of “The Earth” can be seen the following
announcement:

                    WAR WITH THE ISLAND OF BORNEO.
                    BORNEO LAYS DOWN HER ULTIMATUM.
               THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS.
                        PANIC IN STOCK STREET.
              SANTA MA FALLEN 30 POINTS SINCE YESTERDAY.
                   DISSENSION AT THE CITY HOSPITAL.
                 RUMORS OF ACCIDENT AT THE WEST END.)

Enter DR. GAZELL (a short, blond, thick-set,
suave man of middle age) and DR.
CARVER (a very young man; the latter
reading a fresh copy of “The Universe”).

DR. GAZELL (with emotion). Shocking! Shocking! I cannot express--I am
overcome!

DR. CARVER (without emotion). Yes. It is very sad. You’ll be apt to
find these things in “The Universe” before “The Earth” gets them. I
wonder if he--

DR. GAZELL. No. Never. He was above reproach. A hard man to get along
with--willful, but above reproach. I am greatly shocked!

DR. THORNE (stepping out into the crowd). Ah, Gazell! Good-morning. I
am--I am very glad to see you, Dr. Gazell (pathetically).

(DR. GAZELL continues reading his paper. He does not look up.)

DR. THORNE (with embarrassment). Gazell! (He moves directly in front
of the office of “The Earth.” At that moment a new bulletin flashes in
large letters, over the heads of the crowd, these words:--

                           RUMOR CONFIRMED.
                          SHOCKING ACCIDENT!
                           TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
                       RUNAWAY AT THE WEST END.
                MRS. FREDERICK FAYTH DANGEROUSLY HURT.
                  THE EMINENT AND POPULAR PHYSICIAN,
                         DR. ESMERALD THORNE,
                          KILLED INSTANTLY.)

(DR. THORNE reads, and reels; stares about him appealingly.)

(Murmurs are heard from the crowd.)

Enter two Office Girls.

(FIRST OFFICE GIRL starts, and points to the bulletin.)

SECOND OFFICE GIRL. Oh! Oh! (She bursts into tears.)

SUBURBAN. Too bad! He was a clever fellow. He saved my little boy’s life
last summer.

LOAFER. He took a t’orn out av me eye onct and divil a cint did he
charrge for ’t.

PRIEST. Pater Noster in Cœlo--gone without absolution, poor soul! An
attractive heretic--merciful to the poor of my parish.

DR. GAZELL. He drove too fast a horse. And he drove the horse too fast.
I always told him so. But I am greatly agitated by this!

DR. CARVER (reading aloud). Now “The Universe” had it already in type:
“Dr. Thorne was dragged for some distance before the horse broke free.
He was found near the buggy, which was a wreck. The robe was over him,
and his face was hidden. Life was extinct when he was discovered, which
was not for an unaccountably long time. His watch had stopped at five
minutes past seven o’clock. He was not immediately identified. By some
unpardonable blunder the body of the distinguished and favorite
physician was taken to the morgue.”

DR. GAZELL. That accounts for it.

DR. CARVER (reads on). “It was not until nearly midnight that the
mistake was discovered. A message was dispatched to the elegant
residence of the popular doctor. Mrs. Thorne is a young and beautiful
woman, on whom, with their only child, an infant son, this blow falls
with uncommon cruelty.”

DR. THORNE (utters a long, heartrending moan. But no person hears the
sound. He stretches out his hands. The crowd shrinks from but does not
see him. Staring at the bulletin, he stands apart. He raises his
clenched right hand in the air; speaks). It is a dastardly lie! It is
one of those cursed canards manufactured to harass men--and--break the
hearts of women. God!--She has seen it by this time. Let me pass! Let me
go to her! You may kill her with this, but you can’t kill me.
Gentlemen, make way for me! I am Dr. Thorne!

(The crowd pays no attention to this outcry.)

Enter NEWSBOY (shrilly piping).

NEWSBOY. “Earth!” “Universe!” Latest--8.30. All about the accident! Dr.
Thorne killed instantly--Mrs. Fayth still breathin’--“Earth,” sir? Two
cents, sir.

(DR. THORNE clutches the newsboy by the arm, and would tear the paper
from him. DR. THORNE’S fingers grope over it--touch it. He tries
several times to obtain it. The paper remains in the hands of the boy.)

Enter BRAKE, the broker.

(DR. THORNE staggers against BRAKE, who is reading “The Universe.”)

[Exit the Suburban, consulting his watch.

DR. THORNE (more gently; addresses the loafer). Jerry! Is that you,
Jerry! Tell these gentlemen, will you, that I am Dr. Thorne? I should
take it--kindly--of you, Jerry.

LOAFER (stares; mutters). Divil a cint did he charrge me for ’t.

DR. THORNE (addresses the broker). Oh, Brake! I am glad to see you! I
couldn’t get down to save my Santa Ma. But that is of no
consequence.... I’ve been hurt--an accident--and I am confused. I am
suffering from hallucinations. They have got beyond my control. I
wonder if you wouldn’t call a cab for me? I thought Dr. Gazell would
take me home in his carriage,--but he didn’t seem to hear me when I
spoke to him. If you’ll call a cab, I’ll get home--to my wife.

[Exeunt DR. GAZELL, DR. CARVER, and
BRAKE, without replying.

(DR. THORNE watches them with a piteous expression; stands back and
apart from the crowd.)



END OF ACT I.




ACT II.


SCENE I.

A small ward--the women’s ward--in a hospital;
several cots with patients in them are visible. One
patient is in a wheeled chair. Screens stand by the
cots. There are plants, pictures, the cheerful features
of the modern hospital. Two nurses are seen busy
with patients.

Enter DR. GAZELL and DR. CARVER.

DR. GAZELL (seats himself by one of the patients; speaks blandly). And
how do we find ourselves to-day?

PATIENT (turning her face, on which can be seen traces of tears). Bad
enough--worse. I’ve been so upset by--

DR. GAZELL. Yes, yes. I know. It is truly shocking!

DR. CARVER (addressing one of the nurses). You become your cap to-day.
You have an uncommonly good color--I mean to operate on No. 21.

NURSE. Do you really? We thought her improving. She’s nervous to-day--on
account of Dr. Thorne.

DR. CARVER. Yes. Thorne had things all his own way here, as usual. I
mean to operate,--if Dr. Gazell can manage her.

NURSE (coquettishly). You are so expert,--such an easy surgeon. You
don’t mind it more than a layman would carving a Christmas goo--oose.
And what would you operate for--on No. 21?

DR. CARVER. Appendicitis, of course.

NURSE. Really? You are so clever on diagnosis. Now, I hadn’t thought of
appendicitis--in her case. Do you know--I thought it more like pleurisy?

DR. CARVER (looks keenly at the nurse to discover if she is making game
of him; speaks pompously). The nurse, as you have been taught in your
training-school, can have no opinions. Now, the physician--

NURSE (demurely). Oh, of course. I wouldn’t have you think I’m
presuming to set up mine. She might have measles, or the grippe, for
anything I should know.

DR. CARVER. Now you speak very properly indeed.

DR. GAZELL (at bedside of No. 21). Is the pain more severe on the
right?

PATIENT. I didn’t say I had any pain--now.

DR. GAZELL (soothingly). Increasing toward night? Paroxysms? Or is it
steady?

PATIENT. I said I’d got over the pain. That has all gone. It is the
weakness--the deadly weakness.

DR. GAZELL. Just so. That weakness is a most significant symptom--I
think you said it was accompanied by nausea?

PATIENT. No, I didn’t. Not a bit.

DR. GAZELL. Just so. Dr. Carver? Here a moment? (To the patient.) I’m
sure we can relieve all that. Just a little operation--a very pretty
little operation--would set you right again in a week or two.

DR. CARVER (coming to the cotside of No. 21; speaks eagerly). It is
such a beautiful operation! Why, I’ve known patients beg for it,--it
is so beautiful.

PATIENT (beginning to cry). Dr. Thorne said there was no need of
anything of the kind.

DR. GAZELL (stiffening). Dr. Thorne was an able man--but eccentric.
His professional colleagues did not always agree with him.

Enter DR. THORNE. (He has wasted since
his last appearance; looks outcast,
wan, and wretched; is splashed with
mud; still hatless; stands at the
lower end of the ward, gazing blindly
about.)

PATIENT NO. 21. Dr. Thorne used to say that if we had better doctors, we
shouldn’t need so many surgeons. He said the true treatment would
prevent half the surgery in the city.

(DR. THORNE starts, and moves towards the patient.)

DR. GAZELL (soothingly). Yes. Just so. Dr. Thorne had great confidence
in himself.

PATIENT (rousing). No more than his patients had in him.

DR. CARVER. Irritable! Very irritable! A significant symptom, Dr.
Gazell. In my opinion, this extreme irritability demands an operation
for appendicitis.

FIRST NURSE (listening, laughs; addresses SECOND NURSE). Now, if one
could only apply that! Take a cross man,--any cross man,--say a brother,
or a husband, or even a doctor, and if he carried it too far, just call
on Dr. Carver. Why, it would revolutionize society. And he is so expert!
He doesn’t mind it any more than carving a goo--oose. Yes, sir! I’m
coming. (Demurely obedient; hurries to DR. GAZELL.)

(SECOND NURSE moves to the rear of the ward to a patient behind a
screen.)

(DR. THORNE advances slowly; stands in the middle of the ward,
unnoticed.)

PATIENT NO. 21 (louder). I say, when a man’s dead is the time to speak
for him. And I’ll stand up for my dear dead doctor as long as I live.

VOICE FROM ANOTHER COT. And so would I,--and longer, if I got the
chance.

ANOTHER VOICE. He doesn’t need anybody to stand up for him. His deeds do
follow him. And he rests from his labors.

(DR. THORNE smiles bitterly; stands with his face towards the speaker.
He knots his hands in front of him, and thus advances with a motion so
slow as to be almost stealthy.)

VOICE FROM ANOTHER COT. He wouldn’t care so much for that. It’s Bible.
He was not a religious man. But he was as kind to me! (Weeps.)

OTHER VOICES. And to me! Oh, yes, and to me,--as kind!

PATIENT IN THE WHEELED CHAIR. I couldn’t move in my bed when I came
here. I’d been so three years. Look what he’s done for me. (Sobs.)

DR. THORNE (in a low tone). Miss Jessie? Don’t cry so. You’ll make
yourself worse. Go back to bed, Jessie, and--see. I’ll tell you a
secret. Don’t tell the others just yet. I wasn’t killed, Jessie. That
was a newspaper canard. I’m a live man yet. See! Look up, Jessie. Look
at me,--can’t you? (Pleads.) Won’t you, Jessie?

PATIENT IN THE WHEELED CHAIR (stares past him at DR. GAZELL and DR.
CARVER). And to think of the likes of them,--in his place! What ever’ll
become of this hospital without him?

DR. THORNE (with trembling lip). You don’t hear me, do you, Jessie?
Well--well. I must have met with some cerebral shock affecting the
organs of speech. It is a clear case of aphasia. I can’t make myself
understood. It--it’s hard. Jessie? (Louder.) I can’t see things go
wrong with you,--no matter how it is with me. You’ve been in that
chair long enough for to-day. (Imperiously.) Jessie, go back to bed!
Stop crying about me, and go back to your bed.

(JESSIE wavers; shades her eyes with her hands; stares about her;
slowly turns her wheeled chair and moves away.)

       [Exit JESSIE.

DR. THORNE (moves more naturally and rapidly; stands by the cot of No.
21; speaks). Good-morning, Mrs. True. I meant to have seen you last
night. I was--unavoidably detained. I hope you’re not worse this
morning?

PATIENT (with tears). I’ve cried half the night.

DR. THORNE. That’s a pity. But you won’t cry any more. I’ll take care of
you now.

PATIENT (looks up wearily; turns her face on her pillow and sobs).

DR. THORNE. Clearly aphasia. She does not understand a word I say. Dr.
Gazell! Gazell! Dr. Carver?

(The two physicians murmur together.)

DR. THORNE. Gazell? What’s that? The knife? For Mrs. True? Excuse me,
but I cannot permit it.

DR. CARVER. It would be such a pretty little operation. The students are
getting restless for something. I told them--

DR. GAZELL. It is well-defined appendicitis.

DR. THORNE. Well-defined appendi--fiddlesticks! It is nothing but
pleurisy. I tell you, Gazell, I will not have it!

DR. GAZELL (looks around uncomfortably; speaks with hesitation). Of
course, Thorne would not have agreed with us.

DR. THORNE (grips DR. GAZELL by the arm). I tell you it would be
butchery, Gazell! What are you thinking of? Gazell!

DR. GAZELL. But he was a very opinionated man,--everybody knew that.

(DR. THORNE drops DR. GAZELL’S arm and walks away with a gesture of
distress.)

SECOND NURSE (to FIRST NURSE; moves out from behind the screen).
Very invigorating day!

FIRST NURSE (to SECOND NURSE). Father Sullivan’s late with the
Sacrament. I hope Norah, yonder, won’t get ahead of him. She’s ’most
gone. (Approaching the cot of the patient behind the screen.)

SECOND NURSE (moves away). Yes. She’s been unconscious half an hour.

Enter PRIEST. (He advances to offer Extreme Unction to the dying
patient.)

FIRST NURSE. Lovely morning, Father.

DR. THORNE (standing in the middle of the ward). They used to call my
name when I came in. “Oh, there’s the doctor!” “The doctor’s come!” It
ran from cot to cot--like light. And everybody used to smile. Seems to
me some of them blessed me. Now--

(Sobs from the ward.)

DR. THORNE (tremulously). My patients! Isn’t there one of you who
knows me? Doesn’t anybody hear me? Don’t cry so! All the symptoms
will be worse for it.

THE DYING PATIENT. Doctor? Doctor?

DR. THORNE. That sounds like Norah.

PRIEST (recites behind the screen at NORAH’S bedside the prayer for
the passing soul). “Proficiscere, anima Christiana, de hoc mundo, in
nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis, qui te creavit; in nomine Jesu Christi
Filii Dei vivi, qui pro te passus est; in nomine Spiritus Sancti”--

DR. THORNE (softly). Thank you, Father. (Stands silently with bowed
head.)

Reënter the patient in the wheeled chair.

JESSIE (happily). I’ve had such a lovely dream! I thought Dr. Thorne
was here--in this ward. Oh! (With disappointment.)

DR. THORNE. Jessie!

JESSIE (sadly). It was such a lovely dream! (Droops and turns away.)

(DR. THORNE walks apart; stands drearily, with downcast eyes.)

Enter MRS. FAYTH. (She looks pale and
agitated, but quite happy. She is
dressed as before, for the street, but
her head is bare; is wrapped from
head to foot in her long, pale, dove-colored
opera cape. She goes straight
to DR. THORNE, and touches him upon
the arm; speaks softly.)

MRS. FAYTH. Doctor?

DR. THORNE (starts). Oh! Mary Fayth! You? (He grasps her hand with
pathetic eagerness.) Oh, I never was so glad! You are the first
person--the only one--nobody else seemed to know me. I might have known
you would. Where’s Helen? Isn’t she with you? And you weren’t hurt at
all, were you? I have been--anxious about you. Those cowardly papers
said--I tried to get right over and see you. And, after all, you’re not
hurt. I thank-- (Looks around confusedly.) Ah, what shall I thank?

PRIEST. Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

(DR. THORNE listens with troubled interest, like a child learning a
hard lesson.)

MRS. FAYTH (smiling). I can only stay a minute. I must get back to my
poor Fred.

DR. THORNE. Don’t leave me.

MRS. FAYTH. Oh, poor doctor! Don’t you see? The carriage overturned. I
was badly hurt. I only died an hour ago.

DR. THORNE (gasps, and stares at MRS. FAYTH. He tries to speak, but
can only articulate). You died an hour ago? And I? And I?

MRS. FAYTH (still smiling, with her sweet, mysterious smile). Don’t
take it so hard, doctor. I came to ex-plain it to you. Why, it’s the
most beautiful thing in the world! (Glides away slowly, but smiling to
the last.)

DR. THORNE (throws up his arms in anguish). I am dead! My God! I am a
dead man!

(His face falls into his hands, his whole body collapses slowly, he
drops.)


END OF SCENE I.


SCENE II.

It is night on a street in the West End of the city.
At the right stands a church, dimly lighted for a choir
to practice. An anthem on the organ can be heard.
At the left appears Dr. Thorne’s house, viewed from
the outside. It has high stone steps, and lights are
in the window. One window on the ground floor has
the curtain raised. The interior of the library can be
seen through the window,--glimpses of the books, the
pictures, the table, the lamp with the white lace shade.
The room is empty. Into it--

Enter MRS. THORNE. (She is dressed in
deep black. Her face is drawn with
grief. Her hands are clasped in front
of her. She paces the room drearily.
She is alone. She seats herself by the
table; tries to read; lays the book
down, and rises; paces the room.)

       [Exit MRS. THORNE.

Enter DR. THORNE at the far end of the
street near the church. (He is dressed
as before. He is still pale. His manner
has increased in agitation, but a
new resolution gives more firmness to
his wasted countenance. He speaks,
meditatively.)

DR. THORNE. After all, there is another life. I really did not think
it. (Stops and passes his hand over his eyes; muses.) God knows--if
there is a God--how it is with me. If I have never done anything, or
been anything, or felt anything that was fit to last, I have loved one
woman, and her only--and thought high thoughts for her, and felt great
emotions for her, and I could forget myself for her sake--and I would
have had joy to suffer for her, and I’ve been a better man for love of
her. And I have loved her,--oh, I have so loved her that ten thousand
deaths could not murder that living love! (Falters.) And I spoke to
her--I said to her--like any low and brutal fellow, any common
wife-tormentor--I went from her dear presence to this. (Brokenly.)
... And here there is neither speech nor language. Neither earth nor
heaven, nor my love ... nor my shame ... can give my famished eyes the
sight of her dear face,--nor my sealed lips the power to say, Forgive!

(The organ can be heard from the church.)

DR. THORNE (without noticing the anthem). I will not bear it. No--no.
I will not! I will go to her! (Starts to rush up the street, whose
familiar precincts he seems for the first time to recognize.) Why,
there is my own house! She can’t be two rods away. I wonder if a dead
man can get into his own home? Helen? (His feet lag heavily; he moves
like one who is wading in water. He makes the motions of one who
withstands a strong blast or an invisible force. He is beaten back.
Suddenly he raves.) You are playing with me! You torture a miserable
man. Who and what are you? Show me what I have to fight, and let me
wrestle for my liberty! Though I am a ghost, let me wrestle like a man!
Let me to my wife! Give way and let me seek her! (Slowly recedes, as if
beaten back; bows his head. The man sobs.)

CHOIR FROM THE CHURCH (chant).

    “God is a Spirit.
     God is a Spirit.
     And they that worship Him”--

(Choir breaks off. The organ sounds on.)

(DR. THORNE seems to listen, but with a kind of anger. He slowly
recedes, as if pushed back.)

       [Exit DR. THORNE.

Enter the Veiled Woman. (She stands
mutely and wretchedly. Watches the
house. Wrings her hands, but makes
no sound.)

Enter MRS. THORNE. (Within the house;
can be seen plainly from the street
through the window. She advances
and draws the shade still higher;
stands close to the window, pressing
her hands against the sides of her
eyes; looks out.)

(The Veiled Woman shrinks at the sight of MRS. THORNE.)

       [Exit the Woman.

Reënter DR. THORNE at the other end of the street. (He speaks
shrewdly.) It is nearer at this end. And perhaps, if I didn’t have to
get by that church-- (Hurries up opposite the house. Suddenly he sees
her.) Oh, there’s Helen! God! It is my wife. I--see--my--wife.
(Brokenly.) Dear Helen! (Pushes toward the house. At the foot of his
own steps he falters and falls, still as if beaten back. He struggles as
a man would struggle for his life. The veins stand out on his face and
on his clinched hands. He cries out.) I’m coming, Helen! It is only I,
my girl. Don’t be frightened, dear! I wonder would she be afraid of me?
Perhaps it would shock her. Live people and dead people don’t seem to
understand each other. But I’ll risk it. Helen would go alone and lie
down alive in a grave at midnight, and never look over her shoulder--if
she thought she could see me. I know Helen. I’ll try again. (He
pushes and urges his way onward. But the invisible Power restrains him,
as before. He stretches his arms towards the lighted window.) Here I
am, Helen! I can’t get any farther, somehow.... Come and open the door
for me, my girl,--the way you used to do. Won’t you, Helen? With the boy
in your arms? Perhaps if you opened the door,--I could get in. I ...
(After a silence.) I won’t stay very long. I won’t trouble you any,
Helen. I know I don’t belong there any more. I won’t intrude.
(Wistfully.) Helen! I was cruel to you. I have been ashamed of myself.
I thought if I could get in long enough to say-- (Reflects.) Mary
Fayth went back to see Fred. Nothing prevented her--

(MRS. THORNE throws open the window. Leans out and looks about.)
