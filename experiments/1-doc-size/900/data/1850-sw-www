your floor this some time." 



CHAPTER XXIV. 



Great preparations were making all Saturday and Monday for the expected gathering. From morning till night 
Miss Fortune was in a perpetual bustle. The great oven was 
heated no less than three several times on Saturday alone. 
Ellen could hear the breaking of eggs in the buttery, and the 
sound of beating or whisking for a long time together ; and 
then Miss Fortune would come out with floury hands, and 
plates of empty egg-shells made their appearance. But 
Ellen saw no more. Whenever the coals were swept out of 
the oven and Miss Fortune had made sure that the heat was 
just right for her purposes, Ellen was sent out of the way, 
and when she got back there was nothing to be seen but the 
fast-shut oven door. It was just the same when the dishes 
in all their perfection were to come out of the oven again. 
The utmost Ellen was permitted to see was the napkin cover- 
ing some stray cake or pie that by chance had to pass through 
the kitchen where she was. 

As she could neither help nor look on, the day passed 
rather wearily. She tried studying ; a very little she found 
was enough to satisfy both mind and body in their present 
state. She longed to go out again and see how the snow 
looked, but a fierce wind all the fore part of the day made it 
unfit for her. Towards the middle of the afternoon she saw 
with joy that it had lulled, and though very cold, was so 
bright and calm that she might venture. She had eagerly 
opened the kitchen door to go up and get ready, when a 
long weary yawn from her old grandmother made her look 
back. The old lady had laid her knitting in her lap and bent 
her face down to her hand, which she was rubbing across her 







brow as if to clear away the tired feeling- that had settled 
there. Ellen's conscience instantly brought up Alice's 
words, — " Can't you do something to pass away a tedious 
hour now and then ?" The first feeling was of vexed regret 
that they should have come into her head at that moment ; 
then conscience said that was very selfish. There was a 
struggle. Ellen stood with the door in her hand, unable to 
go out or come in. But not long. As the words came back 
upon her memory, — " A charge to keep I have," — her mind 
was made up ; after one moment's prayer for help and for- 
giveness she shut the door, came back to the fireplace, and 
spoke in a cheerful tone. 

" Grandma, wouldn't you like to have me read something 
to you ?" 

" Read !" answered the old lady," " Laws a me ! I don't 
read nothing deary." 

" But wouldn't you like to have me read to you, grandma ?" 

The old lady in answer to this laid down her knitting, 
folded both arms round Ellen, and kissing her a great many 
times declared she should like anything that came out of 
that sweet little mouth. As soon as she was set free Ellen 
brought her Bible, sat down close beside her, and read chap- 
ter after chapter; rewarded even then by seeing that though 
her grandmother said nothing she was listening with fixed 
attention, bending down over her knitting; as if in earnest care 
to catch every word. And when at last she stopped, warned 
by certain noises down stairs that her aunt would presently 
be bustling in, the old lady again hugged her close to her 
bosom, kissing her forehead and cheeks and lips, and declaring that she was " a great deal sweeter than any sugar- 
plums ;" and Ellen was very much surprised to feel her face 
wet with a tear from her grandmother's cheek. Hastily kissing her again (for the first time in her life) she ran out of 
the room, her own tears starting and her heart swelling big. 
" ! how much pleasure," she thought, " I might have given 
my poor grandma, and how I have let her alone all this 
while ! How wrong I have been. But it sha'n't be so in 
future !" 

It was not quite sundown, and Ellen thought she might 
yet have two or three minutes in the open air. So she 
wrapped up very warm and went out to the chip yard. 





Ellen's heart was very light ; she had just been fulfilling 
a duty that cost her a little self-denial, and the reward had 
already come ; and now it seemed to her that she had never 
seen anything so perfectly beautiful as the scene before her ; — 
the brilliant snow that lay in a thick carpet over all the fields 
and hills, and the pale streaks of sunlight stretching across it 
between the long shadows that reached now from the barn 
to the house. One moment the light tinted the snow-capped 
fences and whitened barn-roofs ; then the lights and the 
shadows vanished together, and it was all one cold dazzling 
white. how glorious !— Ellen almost shouted to herself. 
It was too cold to stand still ; she ran to the barn-yard to 
see the cows milked. There they were, — all her old friends, — 
Streaky and Dolly and Jane and Sukey and Betty Flynn, — 
sleek and contented ; winter and summer were all the same 
to them. And Mr. Van Brunt was very glad to see her 
there again, and Sam Larkens and Johnny Low looked as if 
they were too, and Pollen told them with great truth she was 
very glad indeed to be there ; and then she went in to sup- 
per with Mr.. Van Brunt and an amazing appetite. 

That was Saturday. Sunday passed quietly, though Ellen 
could not help suspecting it was not entirely a day of rest to 
her aunt ; there was a savory smell of cooking in the morning which nothing that came on table by any means accounted for, and Miss Fortune was scarcely to be seen the 
whole day. 

With Monday morning began a grand bustle, and Ellen 
was well enough now to come in for her share. The kitchen, 
parlor, hall, shed, and lower kitchen, must all be thoroughly 
swept and dusted ; this was given to her, and a morning's 
work pretty near she found it. Then she had to rub bright all 
the brass handles of the doors, and the big brass andirons in 
the parlor, and the brass candlesticks on the parlor mantle- 
piece. When at last she had got through and came to the 
fire to warm herself, she found her grandmother lamenting 
that her snuff-box was empty, and asking her daughter to 
fill it for her. 

"0 I can't be bothered to be running up stairs to fill snuff- 
boxes !" answered that lady ; "you'll have to wait." 

"I'll get it grandma," said Ellen, "if you'll tell me 
where." 







" Sit down and be quiet !" said Miss Fortune. " You go 
into my room just when I bid you, and not till then." 

Ellen sat down. But no sooner was Miss Fortune hid in 
the buttery than the old lady beckoned her to her side, and 
nodding her head a great many times, gave her the box, 
saying softly, 

" You can run up now, she won't see you, deary. It's in 
a jar in the closet. Now's the time." 

Ellen could not bear to say no. She hesitated a minute, 
and then boldly opened the buttery door. 

" Keep out ! — what do you want ?" 

" She wanted me to go for the snuff," said Ellen in a 
whisper ; " please do let me — I won't look at anything nor 
touch anything, but just get the snuff." 

With an impatient gesture her aunt snatched the box from 
her hand, pushed Ellen out of the buttery and shut the door. 
The old lady kissed and fondled her as if she had done what 
she had only tried to do ; smoothed down her hair, praising 
its beauty, and whispered, 

" Never mind deary, — you'll read to grandma, won't you ?" 

It cost Ellen no effort now. With the beginning of kind 
offices to her poor old parent, kind feeling had sprung up 
fast ; instead of disliking and shunning she had begun to love 
her. 

There was no dinner for any one this day. Mr. and Mrs. 
Van Brunt came to an early tea ; after which Ellen was sent to 
dress herself, and Mr. Van Brunt to get some pieces of board 
for the meat-choppers. He came back presently with an 
armful of square bits of wood ; and sitting down before the 
fire began to whittle the rough sawn ends over the hearth. 
His mother grew nervous. Miss Fortune bore it as she 
would have borne it from no one else, but vexation was 
gathering in her breast for the first occasion. Presently 
Ellen's voice was heard singing down the stairs. 

" I'd give something to stop that child's pipe !" said Miss 
Fortune ; " she's eternally singing the same tiling over and 
over — something about ' a charge to keep ' — I'd a good no- 
tion to give her a charge to keep this morning ; it would have 
been to hold her tongue." 

" That would have been a public loss, I think," said Mr. 
Van Brunt gravely. 







"Well you are making a precious litter!'' said the lady, 
turning short upon him. 

" Never mind," said he in the same tone, — " it's nothing but 
what the fire'll burn up anyhow; — don't worry yourself 
about it." 

Just as Ellen came in, so did Nancy by the other door. 
"What are you here for?" said Miss Fortune with an 
ireful face. 

V Oh ! — Come to see the folks and get some peaches," 
said Nancy ; — " come to help along, to be sure." 
" Aint your grandma coming ?" 

" No ma'am, she aint. I knew she wouldn't be of much 
use, so I thought I wouldn't ask her." 

Miss Fortune immediately ordered her out. Half laughing, 
half serious, Nancy tried to keep her ground, but Miss Fortune was in no mood to hear parleying. She laid violent 
hands on the passive Nancy, and between pulling and pushing at last got her out and shut the door. Her next sudden 
move was to haul off her mother to bed. Ellen looked her 
sorrow at this, and Mr. Van Brunt whistled Azs thoughts ; but 
that either made nothing, or made Miss Fortune more determined. Off she went with her old mother under her arm. 
While she was gone Ellen brought the broom to sweep up 
the hearth, but Mr. Van Brunt would not let her. 

" No," said he, — " it's more than you nor I can do. You 
know," said he with a sly look, " we might sweep up the 
shavings into the wrong corner !" 

This entirely overset Ellen's gravity, and unluckily she 
could not get it back again, even though warned by Mrs. 
Van Brunt that her aunt was coming. Trying only made it 
worse, and Miss Fortune's entrance was but the signal for a 
fresh burst of hearty merriment. What she was laughing at 
was of course instantly asked, in no pleased tone of voice. 
Ellen could not tell ; and her silence and blushing only made 
her aunt more curious. 

" Come, leave bothering her," said Mr. Van Brunt at last, 
" she was only laughing at some of my nonsense, and she 
won't tell on me." 

" Will you swear to that ?" said the lady sharply. 

" Humph ! — no, I won't swear ; unless you will go before 
a magistrate with m€ ; — but it is true." 







" I wonder if you think I am as easy blinded as all that 
comes to !" said Miss Fortune scornfully. 

And Ellen saw that her aunt's displeasure was all gathered 
upon her for the evening. She was thinking of Alice's words 
and trying to arm herself with patience and gentleness, when 
the door opened, and in walked Nancy as demurely as if 
nobody had ever seen her before. 

" Miss Fortune, granny sent me to tell you she is sorry she 
can't come to-night — she don't think it would do for her to 
be out so late, — she's a little touch of the rheumatics, she 



" Very well," said Miss Fortune. " Now clear out !" 
" You had better not say so Miss Fortune — I'll do as much 
for you as any two of the rest, — see if I don't !" 

" I don't care — if you did as much as fifty !" said Miss 
Fortune impatiently. " I won't have you here ; so go, or I'll 
give you something to help you along." 

Nancy saw she had no chance with Miss Fortune in her 
present humor, and went quietly out. A little while after 
Ellen was standing at the window from which through the 
shed window she had a view of the chip yard, and there she 
saw Nancy lingering still, walking round and round in a circle, and kicking the snow with her feet in a discontented 
fashion. 

" I am very glad she isn't going to be here," thought 
Ellen. " But poor thing ! I dare say she is very much disappointed. And how sorry she will feel going back all that 
long long way home ! — what if I should get her leave to stay ? 
wouldn't it be a fine way of returning good for evil ? — But oh 
dear! I don't want her here ! — But that's no matter — " 

The next minute Mr. Van Brunt was half startled by 
Ellen's hand on his shoulder, and the softest of whispers in 
his ear. He looked up, very much surprised. 

" Why, do you want her ?" said he, likewise in a low tone. 
No, ' said Ellen, " but I know I should feel very sorry if 
I was in her place." 

Mr. Van Brunt whistle i quietly to himself. " Well I" said 
he, "you are a good-naiured piece." 

" Miss Fortune," said he presently, " if that mischievous 
girl comes in again I recommend you to let her stay." 

" Why ?" 







" 'Cause it's true what she said — she'll do you as much 
good as half a dozen. She'll behave herself this evening, I'll 
engage, or if she don't I'll make her." 

" She's too impudent to live ! But I don't care — her 
grandmother is another sort, — but I guess she is gone by this 
time." 

Ellen waited only till her aunt's back was turned. She 
slipped down stairs and out at the kitchen door, and ran up 
the slope to the fence of the chip-yard. 

" Nancy — Nancy !" 

"What ?" said Nancy, wheeling about. 

" If you go in now I guess aunt Fortune will let you stay." 

" What makes you think so ?" said the other surlily. 

" 'Cause Mr. Van Brunt was speaking to her about it. Go 
in and you'll see.'' 

Nancy looked doubtfully at Ellen's face, and then ran has- 
tily in. More slowly Ellen w r ent back by the way she came. 
When she reached the upper kitchen she found Nancy as 
busy as possible, — as much at home already as if she had 
been there all day ; helping to set the table in the hall, and 
going to and fro betw r een that and the buttery with an important face. Ellen w r as not suffered to help, nor even to 
stand and see what w r as doing ; so she sat dowm in the corner 
by her old friend Mrs. Van Brunt, and with her head in her 
lap watched by the fire-light the busy figures that went back 
and forward, and Mr. Van Brunt who still sat working at his 
bits of board. There w r ere pleasant thoughts in Ellen's head 
that kept the dancing blaze company. Mr. Van Brunt once 
looked up and asked her what she was smiling at ; the smile 
brightened at his question, but he got no more answer. 

At last the supper was all set out in the hall so that it 
could very easily be brought into the parlor when the time 
came ; the waiter with the best cups and saucers, which 
always stood covered with a napkin on the table in the front 
room, was carried away ; the great pile of wood in the parlor 
fire-place, built ever since morning, was kindled ; all was in 
apple-pie order, and nothing was left but to sweep up the 
shavings that Mr. Van Brunt had made. This was done ; and 
then Nancy seized hold of Ellen. 

" Come along," said she, pulling her to the window, — 
" come along and let us w r atch the folks come in." 



" But it isn't time for them to be here yet," said Ellen ; 
* the fire is only just burning." 

" Fiddle-de-dee ! they won't wait for the fire to burn, I 
can tell you. They'll be along directly, some of them. I 
wonder what Miss Fortune is thinking of, — that fire had 
ought to have been burning this long time ago, — but they 
won't set to work till they all get here, that's one thing. Do 
you know what's going to be for supper?" 

" No." 

''Not a bit?" 
" No." 

" Aint that funny ! Then I'm better off than you. I say, 
Ellen, any one would think I was Miss Fortune's niece and 
you was somebody else, wouldn't they ? Goodness ! I'm glad 
I aint. I am going to make part of the supper myself, — 
what do you think of that ? Miss Fortune always has grand 
suppers — when she has 'em at all ; 'taint very often, that's 
one thing. I wish she'd have a bee every week, I know, and 
let me come and help. Hark! — didn't I tell you? there's 
somebody coming this minute ; don't you hear the sleigh- 
bells ? I'll tell you who it is now ; it's the Lawsons ; you 
see if it aint. It's good it's such a bright night — we can see 
'em first-rate. There — here they come — just as I told you 
— here's Mirny Lawson the first one — if there's anybody I 
do despise it's Mirny Lawson." 

" Hush !" said Ellen. The door opened and the lady herself walked in, followed by three others — large tall women, 
muffled from head to foot against the cold. The quiet kitchen 
was speedily changed into a scene of bustle. Loud talking 
and laughing — a vast deal of unrobing — pushing back and 
pulling up chairs on the hearth — and Nancy and Ellen running in and out of the room with countless wrappers, cloaks, 
shawls, comforters, hoods, mittens, and moccasins. 

" What a precious muss it will be to get 'em all their own 
things when they come to go away again," said Nancy. 
" Throw 'em all down there Ellen, in that heap. Now come 
quick — somebody else'll be here directly." 

"Which is Miss Mirny?" said Ellen. 

" That big ugly woman in the purple frock. The one next 
her is Kitty — the black-haired one is Mary, and 'tother is 
Fanny. Ugh ! don't look a.* 'em ; I can't bear 'em." 





"Why?" 

" 'Cause I don't, I can tell you ; reason good. They are 
as stingy as they can live. Their way is to get as much as 
they can out of other folks, and let other folks get as little 
as they can out of them. I know 'em. Just watch that 
purple frock when it comes to the eating. There's Mr. Bob." 

" Mr. who ?" 

" Bob — Bob Lawson. He's a precious small young man, 
for such a big one. There — go take his hat. Miss Fortune," 
said Nancy coming forward, " mayn't the gentlemen take 
care of their own things in the stoop, or must the young 
ladies wait upon them too ? 'tother room won't hold everything 
neither." 

This speech raised a general laugh, in the midst of which 
Mr. Bob carried his own hat and cloak into the shed as 
desired. Before Nancy had done chuckling came another 
arrival ; a tall lank gentleman, with one of those unhappy - 
shaped faces that are very broad at the eyes and very narrow 
across the chops, and having a particularly grave and duk 
expression. He was welcomed with such a shout of mingled 
laughter, greeting, and jesting, that the room was in a complete hurly-burly ; and a plain-looking stout elderly lady, 
who had come in just behind him, was suffered to stand unnoticed. 

" It's Miss Janet," whispered Nancy, — Mr. Marshchalk's 
aunt. Nobody wants to see her here ; she's one of your pious 
kind, and that's a kind your aunt don't take to." 

Instantly Ellen was at her side, offering gently to relieve 
her of hood and cloak, and with a tap on his arm drawing 
Mr. Van Brunt's attention to the neglected person. 

Quite touched by the respectful politeness of her manner, 
the old lady inquired of Miss Fortune as Ellen went off with 
a load of mufflers, " who was that sweet little thing ?" 

" It's a kind of sweetmeats that is kept for company, Miss 
Janet," replied Miss Fortune with a darkened brow. 

" She's too good for every-day use, that's a fact," remarked Mr. Van Brunt. 

Miss Fortune colored and tossed her head, and the company were for a moment still with surprise. Another arrival 
set them agoing again. 

" Here come the Hitchcocks, Ellen," said Nancy. " Walk 



in Miss Mary — walk in Miss Jenny — Mr. Marshchalk has been 
here this great while." 

Miss Mary Hitchcock was in nothing remarkable. Miss 
Jenny when her wrappers were taken off showed a neat little 
round figure, and a round face of very bright and good- 
humored expression. It fastened Ellen's eye, till Nancy 
whispered her to look at Mr. Juniper Hitchcock, and that young 
gentelman entered dressed in the last style of elegance. His 
hair was arranged in a faultless manner — unless perhaps it 
had a little too much of the tallow candle ; for when he had 
sat for a while before the fire it had somewhat the look of 
being excessively wet with perspiration. His boots were as 
shiny as his hair ; his waistcoat was of a startling pattern ; 
his pantaloons were very tightly strapped down ; and at the 
end of a showy watch-riband hung some showy seals. 

The kitchen was now one buzz of talk and good-humor. 
Ellen stood half smiling herself to see the universal smile, 
when Nancy twitched her. 

" Here's more coming — Cilly Denison, I guess — no, it's 
too tall ; — who is it ?" 

But Ellen flung open the door with a half-uttered scream 
and threw herself into the arms of Alice, and then led her 
in ; her face full of such extreme joy that it was perhaps one 
reason why her aunt's wore a very doubtful air as she came 
forward. That could not stand however against the grace- 
ful politeness and pleasantness of Alice's greeting. Miss 
Fortune's brow smoothed, her voice cleared, she told Miss 
Humphreys she was very welcome, and she meant it. Cling- 
ing close to her friend as she went from one to another, 
Ellen was delighted to see that every one echoed the wel- 
come. Every face brightened at meeting hers, every eye 
softened, and Jenny Hitchcock even threw her arms round 
Alice and kissed her. 

Ellen left now the window to Nancy and stood fast by her 
adopted sister, with a face of satisfaction it was pleasant to 
see, watching her very lips as they moved. Soon the door 
opened again, and various voices hailed the new-comer as 
"Jane," " Jany," and "Jane Huff." She was a decidedly 
plain-looking country girl, but when she came near Ellen 
saw a sober sensible face and a look of thorough good-nature 
which immediately ranked her next to Jenny Hitchcock in 






her fancy. Mr. Bill Huff followed, a sturdy young man; 
quite as plain and hardly so sensible-looking, he was still 
more shining with good-nature. He made no pretension 
to the elegance of Mr. Juniper Hitchcock ; but before 
the evening was over, Ellen had a vastly greater respect 
for him. 

Last, not least, came the Dennisons ; it took Ellen some 
time to make up her mind about them. Miss Cilly, or Cecilia, 
was certainly very elegant indeed. Her hair was in the 
extremest state of nicety, with a little round curl plastered 
in front of each ear ; how she coaxed them to stay there 
Ellen could not conceive. She wore a real watch, there was 
no doubt of that, and there was even a ring on one of her 
fingers with two or three blue and red stones in it. Her 
dress was smart, and so was her figure, and her face was 
pretty; and Ellen overheard one of the Lawsons whisper 
to Jenny Hitchcock that "there wasn't a greater lady in 
the land than Cilly Dennison." Her brother was very 
different ; tall and athletic, and rather handsome, he made no 
pretension to be a gentleman. He valued his fine farming 
and fine cattle a great deal higher than Juniper Hitchcock's 
gentility. 



CHAPTER XXV. 




As the party were all gathered it was time to set to work. 
The fire in the front room was burning up finely now, but 
Miss Fortune had no idea of having pork-chopping or appleparing done there. One party was despatched down stairs 
into the lower kitchen ; the others made a circle round the 
fire. Every one was furnished with a sharp knife, and a 
basket of apples was given to each two or three. Now it 
would be hard to say whether talking or working went on 
best. Not faster moved the tongues than the fingers ; not 
smoother went the knives than the flow of talk ; while there 
was a constant leaping of quarters of apples from the hands 
that had prepared them into the bowls, trays, or what-not, 
that stood on the hearth to receive them. Ellen had nothing 
to do ; her aunt had managed it so, though she would gladly 
have shared the work that looked so pretty and pleasant in 
other people's hands. Miss Fortune would not let her ; so she 
watched the rest, and amused herself as well as she could with 
hearing and seeing ; and standing between Alice and Jenny 
Hitchcock, she handed them the apples out of the basket as 
fast as they were ready for them. It was a pleasant evening 
that. Laughing and talking went on so merrily ; stories were 
told ; anecdotes, gossip, jokes, passed from mouth to mouth ; 
and not one made himself so agreeable, or had so much to do 
with the life and pleasure of the party, as Alice. Ellen saw 
it, delighted. The pared apples kept dancing into the bowls 
and trays ; the baskets got empty surprisingly fast ; Nancy 
and Ellen had to run to the barrels in the shed again and 
again for fresh supplies. 







"Do they mean to do all these to-night ?" said Ellen to 
Nancy on one of these occasions. 

" I don't know what they mean, I am sure," replied Nancy, 
diving down into the barrel to reach the apples ; — " if you had 
asked me what Miss Fortune meant, I might ha' given a 
guess." 

" But only look," said Ellen, — " only so many done, and all 
these to do ! — Well, I know what ' busy as a bee' means 
now, if I never did before." 

" You'll know it better to-morrow, I can tell you." 

"Why?" 

" wait till you see. I wouldn't be you to-morrow for 
something though. Do you like sewing ?" 

" Sewing !" said Ellen. But " Girls ! girls ! — what are 
you leaving the door open for !" — sounded from the kitchen, 
and they hurried in. 

" 'Most got through, Nancy ?" inquired Bob Lawson. 
(Miss Fortune had gone down stairs.) 

" Ha'n't begun to, Mr. Lawson. There's every bit as 
many to do as there was at your house 'tother night." 

" What on airth does she want with such a sight of 'em," 
inquired Dan Dennison. 

" Live on pies and apple-sass till next summer," suggested 
Mirny Lawson. 

" That's the stuff' for my money !" replied her brother ; 
** 'taters and apple-sass is my sass in the winter." 

" It's good those is easy got," said his sister Mary ; " the 
sass is the most of the dinner to Bob most commonly." 

" Are they fixing for more apple-sass down stairs ?" Mr. 
Dennison went on rather dryly. 

" No — hush !" — said Juniper Hitchcock, — " sassages !" 

" Humph !" said Dan, as he speared up an apple out of 
the basket on the point of his knife, — " aint that something 
like what you call killing two " 

" Just that exactly," said Jenny Hitchcock, as Dan broke 
off short, and the mistress of the house walked in. "Ellen," 
she whispered, " don't you want to go down stairs and see 
when the folks are coming up to help us? And tell the 
doctor he must be spry, for we aint a-going to get through in 
a hurry," she added laughing. 

" Which is the doctor ma'am ?" 







" The doctor — Doctor Marshchalk — don't you know ?" 
" Is he a doctor ?" said Alice. 

" No, not exactly I suppose, but he's just as good as the 
real. He's a natural knack at putting bones in their places 
and all that sort of thing. There was a man broke his leg 
horribly at Thirlwall the other day, and Gibson was out of 
the way, and Marshchalk set it, and did it famously they 
said. So go Ellen, and bring us word what they are all 
about." 

Mr. Van Brunt was head of the party in the lower kitchen. 
He stood at one end of the table, cutting with his huge knife 
the hard-frozen pork into very thin slices, which the rest of 
the company took and before they had time to thaw cut up 
into small dice on the little boards Mr. Van Brunt had prepared. As large a fire as the chimney would hold was built 
up and blazing finely ; the room looked as cozy and bright 
as the one up stairs, and the people as busy and as talkative. 
They had less to do however, or they had been more smart, 
for they were drawing to the end of their chopping ; of which 
Miss Janet declared herself very glad, for she said " the 
wind came sweeping in under the doors and freezing her feet 
the whole time, and she was sure the biggest fire ever was 
built couldn't warm that room ;" an opinion in which Mrs. 
Van Brunt agreed perfectly. Miss Janet no sooner spied 
Ellen standing in the chimney-corner than she called her to 
her side, kissed her, and talked to her a long time, and finally 
fumbling in her pocket brought forth an odd little three-cornered pin-cushion which she gave her for a keep-sake. Jane 
Huff and her brother also took kind notice of her ; and Ellen 
began to think the world was full of nice people. About 
half-past eight the choppers went up and joined the company 
who were paring apples ; the circle was a very large one now, 
and the buzz of tongues grew quite furious. 

" What are you smiling at?" asked Alice of Ellen, who 
stood at her elbow. 

"I don't know," said Ellen, smiling more broadly ; and 
presently added, — " they're all so kind to me." 

" Who ?" 

" everybody — Miss Jenny, and Miss Jane Huff, and 
Miss Janet, and Mrs. Van Brunt, and Mr. Huff, — they all 
speak so kindly and look so kindly at me. But it's very 







funny what a notion people have for kissing —I wish they 
hadn't — I've ran away from three kisses already, and I'm so 
afraid somebody else will t v y next." 

" You don't seem very bitterly displeased," said Alice 
smiling-. 

"I am though, — I can't bear it," said Ellen laughing and 
blushing. " There's Mr. Dennison caught me in the first place 
and tried to kiss me, but I tried so hard to get away I believe he saw I was really in good earnest and let me go. 
And just now, — only think of it, — while I was standing talking 
to Miss Jane Huff down stairs, her brother caught me and 
kissed me before I knew what he was going to do. I declare 
it's too bad !" said Ellen, rubbing her cheek very hard as if 
she would rub off the affront. 

" You must let it pass my dear ; it is one way of expressing kindness. They feel kindly towards you or they would 
not do it." 

" Then I wish they wouldn't feel quite so kindly," said 
Ellen, — " that's all. Hark ! — what was that ?" 

" What is that ?" said somebody else, and instantly there 
was silence, broken again after a minute or two by the faint 
blast of a horn. 

" It's old Father Swaim, I reckon," said Mr. Van Brunt ; 
" I'll go fetch him in." 

"0 yes! bring him in — bring him in," was heard on all 
sides. 

" That horn makes me think of what happened to me 
once," said Jenny Hitchcock to Ellen. " I was a little girl 
at school, not so big as you are, — and one afternoon when we 
were all as still as mice and studying away, we heard Father 
Swaim's horn" — 

" What does he blow it for ?" said Ellen, as Jenny stooped 
for her knife which she had let fall. 

" O to let people know he's there, you know ; did you 
never see Father Swaim ?" 

"No." 

" La ! he's the funniest old fellow ! He goes round and 
round the country carrying the newspapers ; and we get him 
to bring us our letters from the post-office, when there are 
any. He carries 'em in a pair of saddlebags hanging across 
that old white horse of his — I don't think that horse will ever 







grow old, no more than his master, — and in summer he has 
a stick — so long — with a horse's tail tied to the end of it, to 
brush away the flies, for the poor horse has had his tail cut 
off pretty short. I wonder if it isn't the very same," said 
Jenny, laughing heartily ; " Father Swaim thought he could 
manage it best, I guess." 

" But what was it that happened to you that time at 
school ?" said Ellen. 

" Why when we heard the horn blow, our master, the 
schoolmaster you know, went out to get a paper ; and I was 
tired with sitting still, so I jumped up and ran across the room 
and then back again, and over and back again, five or six 
times ; and when he came in one of the girls up and told of 
it. It was Fanny Lawson," said Jenny in a whisper to 
Alice, " and I think she aint much different now from what 
she was then. I can hear her now, — ' Mr. Starks, Jenny 
Hitchcock's been running all round the room.' Well what 
do you think he did to me ? He took hold of my two hands 
and swung me round and round by my arms till I didn't 
know which was head and which was feet." 

" What a queer schoolmaster I" said Ellen. 

" Queer enough ; you may say that. His name was 
Starks ; — the boys used to call him Starksification. We did 
hate him, that's a fact. I'll tell you what he did to a black 
boy of ours — you know our black Sam, Alice ? — I forget what 
he had been doing ; but Starks took him so — by the rims of 
his ears — and danced him up and down upon the floor." 

" But didn't that hurt him ?" 

" Hurt him ! I guess it did ! he meant it should. He tied 
me under the table once. Sometimes when he wanted to 
punish two boys at a time he would set them to spit in each 
other's faces." 

" don't tell me about him !" cried Ellen with a face of 
horror ; " I don't like to hear it." 

Jenny laughed ; and just then the door opened and Mr. 
Van Brunt and the old news-carrier came in. 

He was a venerable mild-looking old man, with thin hair 
as white as snow. He wore a long snuff-colored coat, and a 
broad-brimmed hat, the sides of which were oddty looped up 
to the crown with twine ; his tin horn or trumpet was in his 
hand. His saddle-bags were on Mr. Van Brunt's arm. As 







soon as she saw him Ellen was fevered with the notion that 
perhaps he had something for her ; and she forgot everything else. It would seem that the rest of the company had 
the same hope, for they crowded round him shouting out 
welcomes and questions and inquiries for letters, all in a 
breath. 

" Softly — softly " — said the old man sitting down slowly ; 
" not all at once ; I can't attend to you all at once ; — one at 
a time — one at a time." 

" Don't attend to 'em at all till you're ready," said Miss Fortune, — "let 'em wait." And she handed him a glass of cider. 

He drank it off at a breath, smacking his lips as he gave 
back the glass to her hand, and exclaiming, " That's prime !" 
Then taking up his saddlebags from the floor he began slowly 
to undo the fastenings. 

" You are going to our house to-night, aint you Father 
Swaim ?" said Jenny. 

" That's where I was a going," said the old man, " I was 
a going to stop with your father, Miss Jenny ; but since I've 
got into farmer Van Brunt's hands I don't know any more 
what's going to become of me ; — and after that glass of cider 
I don't much care ! Now let's see, — let's see — ' Miss Jenny 
Hitchcock,' — here's something for you. I should like to 
know very much what's inside of that letter — there's a blue 
seal to it. Ah, young folks ! — young folks !" 

Jenny received her letter amidst a great deal of laughing 
and joking, and seemed herself quite as much amused as 
anybody. 

" ' Jedediah B. Lawson,' — there's for your father, Miss 
Mirny ; that saves me a long tramp — if you've twenty-one 
cents in your pocket, that is ; if you ha'n't I shall be obleeged 
to tramp after that. Here's something for 'most all of you, 
I'm thinking. ' Miss Cecilia Dennison,' — your fair hands — 
how's the Squire ? — rheumatism, eh ? I think I'm a younger 
man now than your father, Cecilly ; and yet I must ha' seen 
a good many years more than Squire Dennison ; — I must 
surely. ' Miss Fortune Emerson,'— that's for you ; a double 
letter ma'am." 

Ellen with a beating heart had pressed nearer and nearer 
to the old man till she stood close by his right hand and 
could see every letter as he handed it out. A spot of deepening red was on each cheek as her eye eagerly scanned lettei 
after letter ; it spread to a sudden flush when the last name 
was read. Alice watched in some anxiety her keen look as 
it followed the letter from the old man's hand to her aunt's, 
and thence to the pocket where Miss Fortune coolly bestowed 
it. Ellen could not stand this ; she sprang forward across 
the circle. 

" Aunt Fortune, there's a letter inside of that for me — 
won't you give it to me ? — won't you give it to me ?" she 
repeated trembling. 

Her aunt did not notice her by so much as a look ; she 
turned away and began talking to some one else. The red 
had left Ellen's face when Alice could see it again ; — it was 
livid and spotted from stifled passion. She stood in a kind 
of maze. But as her eye caught Alice's anxious and sorrow- 
ful look she covered her face with her hands, and as quick as 
possible made her escape out of the room. 

For some minutes Alice heard none of the hubbub around 
her. Then came a knock at the door, and the voice of 
Thomas Grimes saying to Mr. Van Brunt that Miss Hum- 
phreys' horse was there. 

"Mr. Swaim," said Alice rising, " I don't like to leave you 
with these gay friends of ours ; you'll stand no chance of rest 
with them to-night. Will you ride home with me ?" 

Many of the party began to beg Alice would stay to supper, but she said her father would be uneasy. The old news- 
carrier concluded to go with her, for he said "there was a 
pint he wanted to mention to parson Humphreys that he had 
forgotten to bring for'ard when they were talking on that 'ere 
subject two months ago." So Nancy brought her things
