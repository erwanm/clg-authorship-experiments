"A what?'' 

" Of Damascus — of Damascus. You know where Damas- 
cus is, don't you "?" 

Fiddle !" said Marianne, — " I thought he was a Jew. 
Did he hve before or after the flood ?" 

" After. I should think you might have known that." 

" W^ell, I can't make out anything about him," said 
Marianne. " We shall have to give it up." 

" No, no, — not yet," said William. " Where did he go 
after his wife ?" 







"Too close a question." 

" Then that don't count. Had he ever seen her before ?" 
" Never." 

" Was she willing to go with him 
Very willing. Ladies always are when they go to be 
married." 

" And what became of her ?" 

" She was married and lived happily, — as I told you." 
" But you said he wasn't married ?" 
" Well, what then? I didn't say she married him." 
" Whom did she marry ?" 

"Ah that is asking the whole ; I can't tell you." 

" Had they far to go ?" asked Isabel. 

" Several days' journey, — I don't know how far." 

" How did they travel ?'' 

" On camels." 

" Was it the Queen of Sheba !" said little Ellen. 

There was a roar of laughter at this happy thought, and 
poor little Ellen declared she forgot all but about the journey ; she remembered the Queen of Sheba had taken a journey, and the camels in the picture of the Queen of Sheba, 
and that made her think of her. 

The children gave up. Questioning seemed hopeless ; and 
Gilbert at last told them his thought. It was Eleazar, Abra- 
ham's steward, whom he sent to fetch a wife for his son 
Isaac. 

" Why haven't you guessed, little mumchance ?" said 
Gilbert to Ellen Montgomery. 

" I have guessed," said Ellen ; — " I knew who it was some 
time ago." 

" Then why didn't you say so ? and you haven't asked a 
single question," said George. 

" No, you haven't asked a single question," said Ellen 
Chauncey. 

" She is a great deal too good for that," said William ; 
" she thinks it is wicked, and that we are not at all nice proper-behaved boys and girls to be playing on Sunday ; she is 
very sorry she could not help being amused." 

" Do you think it is wricked, Ellen ?" asked her little friend. 

" Do you think it isn't right ?" said George Walsh. 







Ellen hesitated ; she saw they were all waiting to hear 
what she would say. She colored, and looked down at 
her little Bible which was still in her hand. It encouraged 
her. 

" I don't want to say anything rude," she began ; — " I don't 
think it is quite right to play such plays, or any plays." 

She was attacked with impatient cries of " Why not ?" 
"Why not?" 

" Because," said Ellen, trembling with the effort she made, — 
" I think Sunday was meant to be spent in growing better 
and learning good things ; and I don't think such plays would 
help one at all to do that ; and I have a kind of feeling that 
I ought not to do it." 

" Well I hope you'll act according to your feelings then," 
said William ; " I am sure nobody has any objection. You 
had better go somewhere else though, for we are going on ; 
we have been learning to be good long enough for one day. 
Come ! I have thought of somebody." 

Ellen could not help feeling hurt and sorry at the half 
sneer she saw in the look and manner of the others as well 
as in William's words. She wished for no better than to go 
away, but as she did so her bosom swelled and the tears 
started and her breath came quicker. She found AHce lying 
down and asleep. Miss Sophia beside her ; so she stole out 
again and went down to the library. Finding nobody, she 
took possession of the sofa and tried to read again ; reading 
somehow did not go well, and she fell to musing on what had 
just passed. She thought of the unkindness of the children ; 
how sure she was it was wrong to spend any part of Sunday 
in such games ; what Alice would think of it, and John, and 
her mother ; and how the Sundays long ago used to be spent, 
when that dear mother was with her ; and then she wondered 
how she was passing this very one, — while Ellen was sitting 
here in the library alone, what she was doing in that far-away 
land ; and she thought if there only wei-e such things as 
oracles that could tell truly, how much she should like to 
ask about her. 

Ellen !" said the voice of John from the window. 

She started up ; she had thought she was alone ; but there 
he was lying in the window seat. 






" What are you doing ?" 
" Nothing," said Ellen. 

" Come here. What are you thinking about ? I didn't 
know you were there till I heard two or three very long 
sighs. What is the matter with my little sister ?" 

He took her hand and drew her fondly up to him. What 
were you thinking about ?" 

" I was thinking about diflferent things, — nothing is the 
matter," said Ellen. 

" Then what are those tears in your eyes for 

" I don't know," said she laughing, — " there weren't any 
till I came here. I was thinking just now about mamma." 

He said no more, still however keeping her beside him. 

" I should think," said Ellen presently, after a few minutes* 
musing look out of the window, — " it would be very pleasant 
if there were such things as oracles — don't you, Mr. John V 

" No." 

" But wouldn't you like to know something about what's 
going to happen ?" 

"I do know a great deal about it." 
" About what is going to happen !" 
He smiled. 

" Yes — a great deal, ElHe, — enough to give me work for 
all the rest of my life." 

" you mean from the Bible ! — I was thinking of other 
things." 

" It is best not to know the other things Ellie ; — I am very 
glad to know those the Bible teaches us." 

" But it doesn't tell us much, does it ? What does it tell 
us?" 

" Go to the window and tell me what you see." 

" I don't see anything in particular," said Ellen, after 

taking a grave look-out. 
" Well, what in general ?" 

" Why there is the lawn covered with snow, and the trees 
and bushes ; and the sun is shining on everything just as it 
did the day we came ; and there's the long shadow of that 
hemlock across the snow, and the blue sky." 

" Now look out again Ellie, and listen. I know that a day 
is to come when those heavens shall be wrapped together as a 







scroll — they shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth 
shall wax old like a garment ; — and it and all the works that 
are therein shall be burned up." 

As he spoke Ellen's fancy tried to follow, — to picture the 
ruin and desolation of all that stood so fair and seemed to 
stand so firm before her ; — but the sun shone on, the branches 
waved gently in the wind, the shadows lay still on the snow, 
and the blue heaven was fair and cloudless. Fancy was 
baffled. She turned from the window. 

" Do you believe it?" said John. 

" Yes," said Ellen, — " I know it ; but I think it is very 
disagreeable to think about it." 

" It would be, Ellie," said he, bringing her again to his 
side, — " very disagreeable — very miserable indeed, if we knew 
no more than that. But we know more — read here.'' 

Ellen took his little Bible and read at the open place. 

" ' Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and 
the former shall not be remembered, neither come into 
mind.' " 

" Why won't they be remembered ?" said Ellen ; — shall 
we forget all about them ?" 

No, I do not think that is meant. The new heavens and 
the new earth will be so much more lovely and pleasant that 
we shall not want to think of these." 

Ellen's eye sought the window again. 

" You are thinking that is hardly possible ?" said John 
with a smile. 

" I suppose it is possible," said Ellen, — " but — " 

" But lovely as this world is, Ellie, man has filled it with 
sin, and sin has everywhere brought its punishment, and 
under the weight of both the earth groans. There will be 
no sin there ; sorrow and sighing shall flee away ; love to 
each other and love to their blessed King will fill all hearts, 
and his presence will be with them. Don't you see that 
even if that world shall be in itself no better than this, it will 
yet be far, far more lovely than this can ever be with the 
shadow of sin upon it ?" 

" yes !" said Ellen. " I know whenever I feel wrong 
in any way nothing seems pretty or pleasant to me, or not 
half so much." 







" Very well," said John, — " I see you understand me. I 
like to think of that land, Ellen, — very much." 

" Mr. John," said Ellen, — " don't you think people will 
know each other again ?" 

" Those that love each other here ? — I have no doubt of it." 

Before either John or Ellen had broken the long musing fit 
that followed these words, they were joined by Alice. Her 
head was better ; and taking her place in the window-seat, 
the talk began again, between the brother and sister now ; 
Ellen too happy to sit with them and listen. They talked 
of that land again, of the happy company preparing for it ; 
of their dead mother, but not much of her ; of the glory of 
their King, and the joy of his service, even here ; — till thoughts 
grew too strong for words, and silence again stole upon the 
group. The short winter day came to an end ; the sunhght 
faded away into moonlight. Ko shadows lay now on the 
lawn ; and from where she sat Ellen could see the great 
hemlock all silvered with the moonlight which began to steal 
in at the window. It was very, very beautiful ; — yet she 
could think now without sorrow that all this should come to 
an end ; because of that new heaven and new earth wherein 
righteousness should dwell. 

" We have eaten up all your grapes, Ellie," said Alice, — 
or rather I have, for John didn't help me much. I think I 
never ate so sweet grapes in my life ; John said the reason 
was because eveiy one tasted of you." 

" I am very glad," said Ellen laughing. 

" There is no evil without some good," Alice went on ; — 
" except for my headache John would not have held my head 
by the hour as he did ; and you couldn't have given me the 
pleasure you did, Ellie. Oh Jack ! — there has been many a 
day lately when I would gladly have had a headache for the 
power of laying my head on your shoulder !" 

" And if mamma had not gone away I should never have 
known you," said Ellen. " I wish she never had gone, but 
I am very, very glad for this !" 

She had kneeled upon the window-seat and clasped Alice 
round the neck, just as they were called to tea. The conversation had banished every disagreeable feeling from Ellen's 
mind. She met her companions in the drawing-room almost 







forgetting that she had any cause of complaint against them. 
And this appeared when in the course of the evening it came 
in her way to perform some little office of pohteness for 
Marianne. It was done with the gracefulness that could 
only come from a spirit entirely free from ungraceful feelings. 
The children felt it, and for the time were shamed into better 
behavior. The evening passed pleasantly, and Ellen went 
to bed very happy. 



CHAPTER XXXL 




The next day it happened that the young people were 
amusing themselves with talking in a room where John 
Humphreys, walking up and down, was amusing himself 
with thinkino^. In the course of his walk he beoan to find 
their amusement rather disturbing to his. The children were 
all grouped closely round Margaret Dunscombe, who was 
entertaining them with a long and very detailed account of 
a wedding and great party at Randolph which she had had 
the happiness of attending. Eagerly fighting her battles 
over again, and pleased with the rapt attention of her hearers, 
the speaker forgot herself and raised her voice much more 
than she meant to do. As every turn of his walk brought 
John near, there came to his ears sufficient bits and scraps of 
Margaret's story to give him a very fair sample of the whole ; 
and he was sorry to see Ellen among the rest, and as the 
rest, hanging upon her lips and drinking in what seemed to 
him to be very poor nonsense. " Her gown was all blue 
satin, trimmed here, — and so, — you know, with the most 
exqmsite lace, as deep as that, — and on the shoulders and 
here — you know, it was looped up with the most lovely 
bunches of" — here John lost the sense. When he came 
near again she had got upon a different topic — " Miss Simmons," says I, " what did you do that for?" " Why," says 
she, how could I help it ? I saw Mr. Pyne coming, and 

I thought I'd get behind you, and so ." The next time 

the speaker was saying with great animation, " And lo, and 
behold, when I was in the midst of all my pleasure, up comes 

a little gentleman of about his dimensions ." He had 

not taken many turns when he saw that Margaret's nonsense" 
was branching out right and left into worse than nonsense. 





" Ellen !" said he suddenly, — " I want you in the library." 

" My conscience !" said Margaret as he left the room, — 
" King John the Second, and no less." 

" Don't go on till I come back," said Ellen ; " I won't be 
three minutes ; just wait for me." 

She found John seated at one of the tables in the library, 
sharpening a pencil. 

" Ellen," said he in his usual manner, — I want you to do 
something for me." 

She waited eagerly to hear what, but instead of telling her 
he took a piece of drawing paper and began to sketch something. Ellen stood by, wondering and impatient to the last 
degree ; not caring however to show her impatience, though 
her very feet were twitching to run back to her companions. 

" Ellen," said John as he finished the old stump of a tree 
with one branch left on it, and a little bit of ground at the 
bottom, " did you ever try your hand at drawing ?" 
No," said Ellen. 

" Then sit down here," said he rising from his chair, 
" and let me see what you can make of that." 

"But I don't know how," said Ellen. 
I will teach you. There is a piece of paper, and this 
pencil is sharp enough. Is that chair too low for you ?" 

He placed another, and with extreme unwillingness and 
some displeasure Ellen sat down. It was on her tongue to 
ask if another time would not do, but somehow she could not 
get the words out. John showed her how to hold her pencil, 
how to place her paper, where to begin and how to go on ; 
and then went to the other end of the room and took up his 
walk again. Ellen at first felt more inclined to drive her 
pencil through the paper then to make quiet marks upon it. 
However necessity was upon her. She began her work; 
and once fairly begun it grew delightfully interesting. Her 
vexation went off entirely ; she forgot Margaret and hoi 
story ; the wrinkles on the old trunk smoothed those on her 
brow, and those troublesome leaves at the branch end brushed 
away all thoughts of everything else. Her cheeks were burning with intense interest, when the library door burst open 
and the whole tioop of children rushed in ; they wanted 
Ellen for a round game in which all their number were 
needed ; she must come directly. 







" I can't come just yet," said she ; " I must finish this first." 

" Afterwards will just do as well," said George ; — " come 
Ellen, do ! — you can finish it afterwards." 

No I can't," said Ellen, — " I can't leave it till it's done. 
Why I thought Mr. John was here ! I didn't see him go out. 
I'll come in a little while." 

" Did he set you about that pracious piece of business ?" 
said William. 

" Yes." 

" I declare," said Margaret, — " he's fitter to be the Grand 
Turk than any one else I know of." 

" I don't know who the Grand Turk is," said Ellen. 

" I'll tell you," said William, putting his mouth close to 
her ear, and speaking in a disagreeable loud whisper, — " it's 
the biggest gobbler in the yard." 

Aint you ashamed William !" cried little Ellen Chauncey. 

" That's it exactly," said Margaret, — always strutting 
about." 

" He isn't a bit," said Ellen veiy angry ; " I've seen peo- 
ple a great deal more like gobblers than he is." 

" Well," said William, reddening in his turn, " I had 
rather at any rate be a good turkey gobbler than one of those 
outlandish birds that have an appetite for stones and glass 
and bits of morocco, and such things. Come, let's us leave 
her to do the Grand Turk's bidding. Come Ellen Chauncey — 
you mustn't stay to interrupt her — we want you !" 

They left her alone. Ellen had colored, but WiUiam's 
words did not hit very sore ; since John's talk with her about 
the matter referred to she had thought of it humbly and 
wisely ; it is only pride that makes such fault-finding very hard 
to bear. She was very sorry however that they had fallen out 
again, and that her own passion, as she feared, had been the 
cause. A few tears had to be wiped away before she could see 
exactly how the old tree stood, — then taking up her pencil she 
soon forgot everything in her work. It was finished, and 
with bead now on one side, now on the other, she was look- 
ing at her picture with very great satisfaction, when her 
caught the figure of John standing before her. 

" Is it done ?" said he. 

" It is done," said Ellen smiling, as she rose up to let him 
come. He sat down to look at it. 
 







" It is very well," he said, — " better than I expected, — it 
is very well indeed. Is this your first trial, Ellen ?" 
Yes— the first." 

" You found it pleasant work ?" 

" very ! — very pleasant. I like it dearly." 

" Then I will teach you. This shows you have a taste for 
it, and that is precisely what I wanted to find out. I will 
give you an easier copy next time. I rather expected when 
you sat down," said he, smiling a little, " that the old tree 
would grow a good deal more crooked under your hands than 
I meant it to be." 

Ellen blushed exceedingly. " I do believe, Mr. John," 
said she, stammering, " that you know everything I am 
thinking about." 

" I might do that, Ellen, without being as wise as an oracle. But I do not expect to make any very painful discoveries in that line." 

Ellen thought, if he did not, it would not be her fault. She 
truly repented her momentary anger and hasty speech to 
William. Not that he did not deserve it, or that it was not 
true ; but it was unwise, and had done mischief, and " it was 
not a bit like peacemaking, nor meek at all," Ellen said to 
herself. She had been reading that morning the fifth chapter of Matthew, and it ran in her head, " Blessed are the 
meek," — " Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be 
called the children of God." She strove to get back a pleasant feeling toward her young companions, and prayed that 
she might not be angry at anything they should say. She 
was tried again at tea-time. 

Miss Sophia had quitted the table, bidding William hand the 
doughnuts to those who could not reach them. Marianne took 
a great while to make her choice. Her brother grew impatient. 

" Well I hope you have suited yourself," said he. " Come, 
Miss Montgomery, don't you be as long ; my arm is tired. 
Shut your eyes, and then you'll be sure to get the biggest 
one in the basket." 

" No Ellen," said John, who none of the children thought 
was near, — it would be ungenerous — I wouldn't deprive 
Master William of his best arguments." 

What do you mean by my arguments ?" said Wilhaiu 
sharply. 







" General!}'-, those which are the most difficult to take in," 
answered his tormentor with perfect gravity. 

Ellen tried to keep from smiling, but could not ; and otherg 
of the party did not try. William and his sister were enraged, the more because John had said nothing they could 
take hold of, or even repeat. Gilbert made common cause with 
them. 

" I wish I was grown up for once," said William. 
Will you fight rn,e sir ?" asked Gilbert, who was a matter of three years older, and well grown enough. 
His question received no answer, and was repeated. 
" No, sir." 
" Why not sir ?" 

" I am afraid you'd lay me up with a sprained ankle," said 
John, " and I should not get back to Doncaster as quickly as 
I must." 

It is very mean of him," said Gilbert, as John walked 
away, — " I could whip him I know." 

" Who's that ?" said Mr. Howard Marshman. 
"John Humphreys," 

" John Humphreys ! You had better not meddle with him 
my dear fellow. It would be no particular proof of wisdom." 

"Why he is no such great affair," said Gilbert; "he's 
tall enough to be sure, but I don't believe he is heavier than 
I am." 

" You don't know, in the first place, how to judge of the 
size of a perfectly well-made man ; And in the second place 
I was not a match for him a year ago ; so you may judge. — I 
do not know precisely," he went on to the lady he was walk- 
ing with, " what it takes to rouse John Humphreys, but when 
he is roused he seems to me to have strength enough for 
twice his bone and muscle. I have seen him do. curious 
things once or twice !" 

" That quiet Mr. Humphreys ?" 

"Humph!" said Mr. Howard, — "gunpowder is pretty 
quiet stuff so long as it keeps cool." 

The next day another matter happened to disturb Ellen. 
Margaret had received an elegant pair of ear-rings as a Christmas present, and was showing them for the admiration of her 
young friends. Ellen's did not satisfy her. 

" Aint they splendid ?" said she. "Tell the truth now 





Ellen Montgomery, wouldn't you give a great deal if somebody would send you such a pair ?" 

" They are very pretty," said Ellen, but I don't think I 
care much for such things, — I would rather have the money." 

" you avaricious ! — Mr. Marshman !" cried Margaret, as 
the old gentleman was just then passing through the room, 
— " here's Ellen Montgomery says she'd rather have money 
than anything else for her present." 

He did not seem to hear her, and went out without mak- 
ing any reply. 

" O Margaret !" said Ellen, shocked and distressed, — " how 
could you ! how could you ! What will Mr. Marshman think ?" 

Margaret answered she didn't care what he thought. 
Ellen could only hope he had not heard. 

But a day or two after, when neither Ellen nor her friends 
were present, Mr. Marshman asked who it was that had told 
him Ellen Montgomery would like money better than anything else for her New Year's present." 

" It was I, sir," said Margaret. 

" It sounds very unlike her to say so," remarked Mrs. 
Chauncey. 

"Did she say so ?" inquired Mr. Marshman. 

" I understood her so," said Margaret, — " I understood her 
to say she wouldn't care for anything else." 

" I am disappointed in her," said the old gentleman ; " I 
wouldn't have believed it." 

" I do not beheve it," said Mrs. Chauncey quietly ; " there 
has been some mistake." 

It was hard for Ellen now to keep to what she thought 
right. Disagreeable feelings would rise when she remembered the impoliteness, the half sneer, the whole taunt, and 
the real unkindness of several of the young party. She found 
herself ready to be irritated, inclined to dislike the sight of 
those, even wishing to visit some sort of punishment upon 
them. But Christian principle had taken strong hold in 
little Ellen's heart; she fought her evil tempers manfully. 
It was not an easy battle to gain. Ellen found that resentment and pride had roots deep enough to keep her pulling up 
the shoots for a good while. She used to get alone when she 
could, to read a verse, if no more, of her Bible, and pray ; 
she could forgive William and Margaret moro easily then. 







Solitude and darkness saw many a prayer and tear of hers 
that week. As she struggled thus to get rid of sin and to 
be more like what would please God, she grew humble and 
happy. Never was such a struggle carried on by faith in 
him, without .success. And after a time, though a twinge of 
the old feeling might come, it was very slight ; she would 
bid William and Margaret good morning, and join them in 
any enterprise of pleasure or business, with a brow as unclouded as the sun. They however were too conscious of 
having behaved unbecomingly towards their little stranger 
guest to be over fond of her company. For the most part 
she and Ellen Chauncey were left to each other. 

Meanwhile the famous needlebook was in a fair way to be 
finished. Great dismay had at first been excited in the breast 
of the intended giver, by the discovery that Gilbeit had 
consulted what seemed to be a very extraordinary fancy, in 
making the rose a yellow one. Ellen did her best to comfort 
her. She asked Alice, and found there were such things as 
yellow roses, and they were very beautiful too ; and besides 
it would match so nicely the yellow butterfly on the other 
leaf. 

I had rather it wouldn't match !" said Ellen Chauncey ; 
— " and it don't match the rose-colored silk besides. Are the 
yellow roses sweet?" 

" No," said Ellen, — " but this couldn't have been a sweet 
rose at any rate, you know." 

" Oh but," said the other, bursting out into a fresh passion 
of inconsolable tears, — " I wanted it should be the picture of 
a sweet rose ! — And I think he might have put a purple 
butterfly — yellow butterflies are so common ! I had a great 
deal rather have had a purple butterfly and a red rose !" 

What cannot, be cured, however, must be endured. The 
tears were dried, in course of time, and the needlebook with 
its yellow pictures and pink edges was very neatly finished. 
Ellen had been busy too on her own account. Alice had got 
a piece -of fine hnen for her from Aliss Sophia; the collar for 
Mr. Van Brunt had been cut out, and Ellen with great pleasure had made it. The stitching, the strings, and the very 
button-hole, after infinite pains, were all finished by Thuisday 
night. She had also made a needlecase for Alice, not of so 
much pretension as the other one ; this was green morocco
