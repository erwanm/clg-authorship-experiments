in a dull gray gown that wraps her
loosely. Her face is earnest and devout.

DR. THORNE. Why, Norah!

NORAH (looking back). Oh, it is the Doctor.

DR. THORNE. I can’t overtake you, Norah.

NORAH. And I’ve only died the day.

DR. THORNE. But you’ve got the start of me, Norah. You are higher up. I
am glad to see you, Norah (eagerly). But I can’t reach you.

NORAH (holds down her hand). Come up, Doctor! Come up! I’ll help you,
Doctor.

DR. THORNE (gratefully). Thank you, Norah.

NORAH. It’s to Purrgatory I’d be goin’. But you’re the herretic, Doctor.
Which way do you be goin’?

DR. THORNE (shakes his head). I don’t know, Norah. You are wiser than
I am--in this foreign place.

NORAH (holds down her hand). The dear Doctor! Ye were that kind to me,
Doctor,--at the hospital, and forninst the house where I was worrkin’.
It’s niver a cint I had to pay yez for yer thruble. If I’d been a pretty
lady with a purrse of gold, ye never could have put yerself about more
than ye did for the likes of me. It’s not meself that would have died
the day if you’d been there. Doctor? Would yez mind, if I
should--bless you, Doctor? There’s kindness onto kindness, and mercy
goin’ after mercy that ye did me, all hidin’ in a poor girrl’s heart to
rise and meet you here. I was sick an’ ye did visit me.

DR. THORNE (melting). When did I ever show you all that kindness,
Norah? I don’t remember--

NORAH. And I don’t forget. Take my hand, now, Doctor, do. It must be
lonesome down below there by yersel’. (Touches her rosary. Her lips
move in prayer.)

DR. THORNE (climbing on, grasps NORAH’S hand). Thank you, Norah
(gently).

(There is a lull in the storm. It grows lighter.)

(DR. THORNE and the Irish girl climb on together silently.)

(It brightens at the brow of the mountain. Dim outlines of figures are
faintly seen at the summit. They waver, and melt away.)

DR. THORNE (gradually loosening his hold of NORAH’S hand, speaks, but
not to NORAH, bitterly). Now stop a moment. Where will all this end?
Rebelling, I obey; and obeying, I rebel. I am become what we used to
call a spirit. And this is what it means! Better might one become a
molecule, for those at least express the Laws of the Universe, and do
not suffer. I don’t incline to go any higher. (Drops back.) Every step
is taking me further away from my wife.

NORAH (anxiously). Doctor? Doctor! (She climbs on, but looks back,
beckoning.)

DR. THORNE (pays no attention to NORAH. Retraces his steps down the
narrow path). Come what may, I will not go any further from Helen.
I’ll perish first, in this unearthly place. (He continues to descend;
stands lost in thought. The storm darkens round him, but lightens beyond
him. At the summit dim outlines can be seen again. These brighten
faintly.)

(NORAH reaches her arms towards them; climbs on.)

DR. THORNE. It was something to be in the same world with Helen.
(Muses.) Oh, hot in my anger I went from her. And cold, indeed, did I
return. (Still descending.) I will go back. I will get as near the old
system of things as I can. I will not put another span of space between
myself and Helen. Poor, poor girl!

(DR. THORNE, doggedly descending, does not look up.)

(White-robed forms at the summit brighten. Arms are stretched downwards
through a mist. Hands beckon. One of them reaches down and clasps
NORAH’S hand; draws her up.)

NORAH (looking back). Doctor!

(NORAH vanishes.)

(The pass grows dark. Figures at the summit dim.)

(Enter, from a darkness in the mountains,
the Woman in flame-color. Her ashen
mantle is now thrown back, but still
clings to her. She stands mournfully
regarding DR. THORNE. She does not
address him, but slowly extends her
arms.)

(DR. THORNE does not observe the Woman. She does not obtrude herself
upon his attention.)

[Exit the Woman into the darkness
whence she came.

DR. THORNE (with frowning face descends; he murmurs). And a few days
ago I was troubled because I had lost a few thousand dollars in Santa
Ma.... I saved up money! (Scornfully.) I would accumulate a
fortune. Oh, the whole of it, ten hundred thousand-fold the whole of
it, for one hour in a dead man’s desolated home! (Pushes downwards,
suddenly and silently.)

Enter AZRAEL, ANGEL OF DEATH. (The
pass blackens. The mountain summit
is wrapped in darkness.)

(AZRAEL stands tall and resplendent. He is a white-robed figure, winged
and powerful. The light falls only upon AZRAEL and upon the man. It
can be seen that this gleam comes from a sword held in the hand of the
Angel. Without a word he lifts the flaming sword, and with it bars the
narrow pass from side to side.)

DR. THORNE (in a ringing voice). Azrael!

(AZRAEL does not reply.)

DR. THORNE (under his breath). Azrael, Angel of Death! (Falls back.)

(The two figures confront each other in silence. DR. THORNE
desperately flings himself towards the Angel. Without a touch he is
beaten back. AZRAEL stands immovable. His face grows solemn with
pity. DR. THORNE retreats; advances again; raises his staff, and
strikes it upon the Angel’s sword. The staff flames up, burns, and drops
to ashes on the ground.)

(DR. THORNE recedes a few steps; shades his eyes with his hands;
regards the Angel blindly; wavers, turns. Slowly, with bent figure, he
weakly reascends the mountain; stumbles and falls; regains his footing;
climbs on alone, and now without his staff; does not look back.)

(AZRAEL stands immovable, with drawn sword.)

VOICES FROM BEYOND (sing so softly that they seem rather to be
breathing than singing):--

    “The night is dark, and I am far from home,
           Lead Thou me on ...
     O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
           The night is gone,
     And with the morn those angel faces smile,
     Which I have loved long since, and lost a while.”

(As they sing the summit mellows slowly. No figures appear. At the brow
of the mountain a single gleam of light pierces the gloom. It brightens
rather than broadens. It has the color of dawn.)

(AZRAEL fades away, the sword vanishing last.)

(DR. THORNE climbs up, with eyes lifted towards the light on the
summit, which strikes his face and figure.)

AS THE VOICES SING:--

    “And with the morn those angel faces smile,
     Which I have loved long since, and lost a while.”



END OF ACT II.




ACT III.


SCENE I.

Paradise: A beautiful country. Trees, flowers,
shrubs, vines of great luxuriance abound. Brilliant
birds of unfamiliar plumage can be heard singing in
the boughs. They dip, blazing, through the air. The
grass is bright, and like short fur in effect. The
sheen of water, like the surface of a lake or sea, glimmers
beyond. Sails of faint, fair tints, move and
melt upon the sea. At a distance, upon a hill, are
outlines of graceful architecture. A narrow brook
can be seen, with strange shells upon its little banks.
There are no highways visible. Foot-worn walks and
paths, trodden through the grass, intersperse the
landscape. The grass, however, springs afresh beneath
the foot, and is not crushed or sear. Annunciation
lilies and scarlet passion-flowers grow in the
foreground. Bluebells, in clusters, spring beyond.
Roses are many. Flowers unknown to the botanies
of earth are frequent; and among those to which we
are used, it will be noticed that the blossoms of the
tropics and of the North countries flourish side by
side. The whole impression is one of delight and
beauty. The sky has a misty softness, and the atmosphere
is capable of taking on (and takes on) sudden
and subtle changes of effect. It is now seen to be
early morning, and all the tints of the landscape are
tender and fresh.

The scene is populous with bright beings. These
are seen to differ from the people of this planet chiefly
in their joyousness of manner, and in a certain high
expression, of which it might be said, in a word, that
the absence of low motive, and the presence of a sense
of ease and security, are the predominant features.
These beings wear flowing robes of various tints--dove,
rose, blue, corn, violet, silver, gold, and pearl.
Here and there one appears garbed in the color of the
pale leaf, and, in moving among the foliage, seems
to have sprung from it. Many spirits are clothed in
shining white. Happy conversation and gentle laughter
can be heard.

Enter Two Children. These play in the
brook, and gather the shells. They are
robed in short, childish garments--a
little frock, a little dress, both white,
and each clasped by a small, golden
cross.

FIRST CHILD (a boy, four or five years old). I never saw such pretty
shells in that other place we lived. They took me to the seaside
summers, but there weren’t any there that began to be so pretty.

SECOND CHILD (a girl). I never played with any shells before. We
lived in a street. It was dark and dirty. I never saw the sea till I
came here.

FIRST CHILD. I never saw you in that other place, did I?

SECOND CHILD. No. You wouldn’t have played with me there.

FIRST CHILD. I like you here--don’t I?

SECOND CHILD. And I like you. I like you best of anybody I’ve seen in
this pretty country.

FIRST CHILD. Do you like roses? Or don’t you care for anything but
shells?

SECOND CHILD (adoringly). I like roses, if you like roses.

(They leave the brook, and gather roses, pelting each other with them,
and laughing merrily.)

(FIRST CHILD tosses a rose over the brook.)

(SECOND CHILD picks a bluebell, and puts it to her lips.)

FIRST CHILD. No. They’re not to eat. They’re to listen to. See! I’ll
ring mine. Hark! (He rings the bluebell. It gives out a musical
tintinnabulation.) Now, you hark again. I never heard a bluebell ring
in that other place, did you?

SECOND CHILD. I never saw one on our street.... Oh, mine rings,
too!... Say! Are these angels? I never saw an angel either, in our
street.

(The Children wander away and mingle with the groups of spirits. They
ring the bluebells as they go. The tintinnabulation is drowned in
orchestral music, which can be heard from a distance. The theme is from
Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony. Certain of the spirits listen attentively,
and move towards the music. Certain others continue to talk happily, and
stir among the trees.)

Enter DR. THORNE. (Walks slowly and
alone. He is robed still in purple,
with a tunic of white showing at the
throat. He looks pallid and harassed.
He stands for a time apart,
keenly observant of the scene and of
the people, then sinks in thought. He
speaks.)

DR. THORNE. Children here, too?

(He looks wistfully at the two children, who are playing together at a
distance from him. He picks up the rose which the little boy had tossed
over the brook; puts it to his face; speaks.)

DR. THORNE. What a perfume the flowers have in this country! This seems
to be a rose, yet it is not a rose. You might call it the soul of a
rose. Exquisite, whatever it is. Some one has dropped this one. There is
personality clinging to it. Curious! It is as though I clasped a little
hand when I touch it.

(He sighs; walks to and fro thoughtfully; does not throw away the rose,
but cherishes it. Groups of spirits pass and repass. Some of them smile
at him kindly, but he does not return the smile. No one addresses
him.)

DR. THORNE. I have done my share of traveling in my day, but I must say
I never was in a land that seems to me so foreign as this. Nothing looks
natural. I seem to have no acquaintances. Apparently nobody knows me. I
have no introductions. I am afraid I have got here without letters of
credit. (Breaks off.) That was a mistake. I never did such an ignorant
thing before. I must say it is an attractive country, too. Everything
shows a high degree of civilization, and the beauty of the place is
unsurpassed. But it does not appeal to me. (He shakes his head.) ... I
am too homesick.... If Helen were here, I could enjoy it.

(He strolls about without aim or interest. Happy spirits pass and
repass.)

Enter a man-spirit of impressive and
commanding appearance. His costume
bears a certain vague resemblance
to the dress of a gentleman and scholar
of the Court of Charles I. of England.
A cloak of the tint of the dead
oak-leaf is clasped across his breast
by a golden cross. He regards DR.
THORNE with a piercing but kindly
look. He speaks with a fine and
courtly manner, dating from a bygone
age.

THE MAN-SPIRIT. I read thee for a stranger here.

DR. THORNE (bitterly). A stranger in a strange place am I, indeed. You
are the first inhabitant of this country who has troubled himself to
speak to me. Thank you for your politeness, sir.

THE MAN-SPIRIT. I was commanded. These (waving his hand toward the
groups of spirits) were not.

DR. THORNE. You look like a person more fitted to give commands than to
receive them. I fail to understand that word--commanded. I am--at
least, I was--a sovereign citizen of America. I was not born or trained
a subject.

THE MAN-SPIRIT (smiling). And I was subject of an English
sovereign--in fact, an officer of the royal court.

DR. THORNE (without smiling). And this nation? Is it an autocratic
monarchy you have here? What is your political system?

THE MAN-SPIRIT. It is a simple one--a pure theocracy.

DR. THORNE (indifferently). Oh, theocracy? That is a system into which
I have never studied. I have been a busy man. I was a
physician-- (Abruptly.) Would you favor me with your name?

THE MAN-SPIRIT. I was a healer of the sick in my time. My name
was-- (Whispers his name.)

DR. THORNE (starts with pleased surprise). The great Harvey? And
you discovered the circulation of the blood? How wonderful! Why, I
thought you had been mould and clover these two hundred and fifty
years! It never occurred to me that you were alive.... What an
extraordinary fact!

HARVEY (turns away wearily). I did not think to find your education so
limited. I understood you to be a man of superior powers.

DR. THORNE (humbly). Don’t leave me, Doctor Harvey! I am the most
unhappy man in this most happy country.

HARVEY (slowly). Then you did not bring with you the materials of
happiness. What had you? What were your possessions in the life
yonder?

DR. THORNE (solemnly, but still bitterly). Love, happiness, home,
health, prosperity, fame, wealth, ambition. None of them did I bring
with me. I have lost them all upon the way.

HARVEY. Was there by chance nothing else?

DR. THORNE. Nothing more, unless you count a little incidental
usefulness.

HARVEY. Plainly, you are not in a normal condition.

DR. THORNE (hastily). I am perfectly well.

HARVEY. You are sick of soul. You are not in health of spirit. You are
out of harmony with your atmosphere. Do you wish me to take the case?

DR. THORNE. Take the case, Doctor Harvey. Cure me of my nostalgia. Show
me how to become a citizen of this foreign land.

HARVEY. You know what it means to be a patient.

DR. THORNE (grimly). I can think of no worse fate; but I’ll make the
best of it.

HARVEY (smiling kindly). I will undertake the case. At evening inquire
your way to my dwelling. (Moves away; returns; hesitates; lingers;
speaks impulsively.) Concerning the latest attainments in science on
the planet Earth--they have the keenest interest for me. You have so
many advantages--facilities that we never had. (He sighs wistfully.) I
am told that your therapeutics are really wonderful. And the advances in
surgery? Did you find them as beautiful as they are said to be?

Enter a newly arrived woman-spirit. She
is still pale, but has a happy expression.
She recognizes DR. THORNE;
cries eagerly.

WOMAN-SPIRIT. Doctor! Doctor Thorne!

HARVEY. Here comes some of your incidental usefulness. That is a good
symptom. (He moves away, still smiling.)

       [Exit HARVEY.

DR. THORNE. Why, Mrs. True! (Grasps her hand joyfully.) You are the
first person I have seen--the first one I knew! But (reflecting) what
has happened to you? How did you get here?

MRS. TRUE. I died yesterday.... I knew I should see you, Doctor.
(Calmly.) I counted on that.

DR. THORNE (starting back). Did they--you don’t mean to say they
really operated on you? You were convalescent!

MRS. TRUE (laughing outright). Yes, in a week after you were killed.
Dr. Carver vivisected guinea-pigs all that week to keep in practice. I
died under the knife.... I wish you’d seen their faces!

DR. THORNE (eagerly). What did they find--anything to justify the
butchery?

MRS. TRUE. Of course not. Didn’t you say there wasn’t?

DR. THORNE (gratefully). You always were a loyal patient--better than
I deserved.

MRS. TRUE. You always were a kind doctor--better than I deserved.

DR. THORNE. And they slaughtered you in my hospital!

MRS. TRUE (hurrying on). Have you seen my husband? Do you know where
my mother is? I lost a baby twenty years ago. I want to see the little
thing. And oh? when can I see--?

(She breaks off, with a devout expression, and moves away; joins the
upper group of spirits. Two of these can be seen to meet and embrace
her, and lead her on.)

       [Vanish MRS. TRUE.

Enter JERRY, the loafer, hurriedly and
stumbling. His robe is of dull blue,
something in the fashion of a smock-frock,
or butcher’s blouse.

JERRY (staring about him stupidly, and with a kind of social
embarrassment, as if he had been suddenly introduced into a
drawing-room). Div-niver a cint in me pocket, and me hoofin’ it in this
quaer counthree. (Scratches his head, and mutters unintelligibly.) ...
I wondher where the ... sinsible saints I’m at.

DR. THORNE (steps forward; speaks). Why, Jerry! How are you, Jerry?
(Holds out his hand heartily.)

JERRY (staring). Sinsible saints, and silly sinners! Doctor Thorne?...
Why, I thought you was dead. Hilloa, Doctor! (Grasps the doctor’s hand,
and shakes it violently. Then meditatively.) Ye took a t’orn out av me
eye onct, and div-niver a cint did ye charrge for ’t.

DR. THORNE. What are you doing here, Jerry? How did you get here?

JERRY. I was knocked down by a blame bicycle underneat’ a murdherin’
trolley car. Nixt I know I don’t know nothin’, an’ now, behold me, I’m
let loose loafin’ in this quaer counthree.

DR. THORNE. Not drunk, were you, Jerry?

JERRY (shaking his head gravely). I shwore off, Doctor. I shwore off
t’ree years ago. Me little gurrl she give me no repose till I shwore
off.... She died jist av the hospittle, did me little gurrl.... Say,
Doctor, do ye know what’s the thramp laws in this counthree?

       Enter NORAH hastily.

NORAH. Doctor--Doctor Thorne? Have you seen--oh, there he is! There’s me
father! Why, Father, Father dear! (Caresses JERRY affectionately.)

JERRY. Och! wisha, wisha! Norah, me darlint! (Returns her caresses
tenderly.) What luck for the likes of us arrivin’ emigrants thegither
in this agra-able counthree!

NORAH (puts her arm in his). Come yonder wid me, Father. (Draws him
away.)

JERRY (looks back over his shoulder at DR. THORNE). Is it to
confession we do be goin’, Norah?--the wan av us arrivin’ be way of a
murdherin’ doctor, and the wan be way av a murdherin’ trolley! I’m
thinkin’, sir, it’s niver a cint to choose bechune.

       [Exeunt JERRY and NORAH.

DR. THORNE (watches their departure drearily; turns, and walks feebly
towards the brook; speaks). Now I think of it, I have not tasted food
or drink since I have been in this place. I believe I am downright
faint.

(Drinks water from the brook in the palm of his hand; sinks beneath the
low boughs of a tree on thick moss. His head falls upon his arm. From a
distance, and from a height, slowly moving downwards, over the beautiful
landscape, robed in cream white, and unseen by DR. THORNE,

       Enter MRS. FAYTH.

As she approaches, it can be seen that her robe also is clasped across
the breast by a little golden cross.)

SPIRITS BEYOND (softly chant the Te Deum).

    “We praise Thee, O God: we acknowledge Thee to be
       the Lord”--

(Midway of the landscape, and playing merrily,)

       Enter the Two Children.

FIRST CHILD (running to MRS. FAYTH). Oh, here I am! (He clasps her
hand; clings to her affectionately.)

MRS. FAYTH (to Second Child). Run yonder and play, Maidie.

(Second Child obeys prettily, and joins the spirits above. MRS. FAYTH
and the First Child move slowly to the front of the landscape.)

THE CHILD. See that poor man under the tree! I think he’s a hungry
man--don’t you?

(He breaks away from MRS. FAYTH, and runs to DR. THORNE; examines
the exhausted man attentively, bending forward with his hands on his
little knees. MRS. FAYTH advances slowly, with her mysterious smile;
she does not speak.)

THE CHILD (touches DR. THORNE timidly; after a silence speaks,
ceremoniously). Would you like a peach, or do you like plums instead?
I’ll pick you one.

DR. THORNE (arousing). Who spoke to me? Oh, it is a child. (Sinks
back feebly.)

(The Child gathers some fruit from the trees, and brings water from the
brook in the cup of an annunciation lily, which holds the liquid
perfectly; offers the food and drink to the exhausted man. MRS. FAYTH,
still unseen by DR. THORNE, stands quite near, nodding and smiling
at The Child. The Child looks to her for encouragement and
direction.)

DR. THORNE (reviving). Thank you, my little man. (Leans on his elbow,
and gazes steadfastly at The Child; rises to a sitting posture.)

THE CHILD (creeps nearer to DR. THORNE, and, after a moment’s
hesitation, throws his little length full on the moss at the man’s feet,
and scrutinizes him seriously, putting his chin into his hand as he does
so; speaks sympathetically). Do you feel better now?

DR. THORNE. Much better. You’re a thoughtful little fellow.

THE CHILD. Our breakfasts grow all cooked here. This is a nice country.

DR. THORNE (still gazing steadfastly at The Child). Where is your
mother, my lad?

THE CHILD. I don’t know. I lost her on the way, somewhere.

DR. THORNE. And your father? What has become of your father?

THE CHILD. Oh, he’s dead. He got dead before I came here.

MRS. FAYTH (moves within DR. THORNE’S range of vision; speaks
quietly). Good-morning, Doctor. (Smiles brightly.)

DR. THORNE (springs to his feet; cries out). Mary Fayth! I thought you
had forgotten me! I have--needed you.

(The Child rises; leans up against DR. THORNE’S knee confidingly.)

MRS. FAYTH. I have often needed you, Doctor. And you never failed me
once.

DR. THORNE (impetuously). I thought you would have come before. I
looked for you--

MRS. FAYTH. As I have often looked for you. But I was not commanded to
meet you--till this very minute.

DR. THORNE. Commanded? Commanded? There is that singular phrase again.
Have you seen Helen? (Quickly.)

MRS. FAYTH (shakes her head). Not yet.

DR. THORNE. Have you seen your husband? Did they let you go to
Fred?

MRS. FAYTH (contentedly). Oh, many times.

THE CHILD (interrupting). He doesn’t kiss me! (Puts up his lips in a
grieved, babyish fashion.)

MRS. FAYTH (very quietly). Doctor, don’t hurt that child’s feelings.
He’s yours.

DR. THORNE (gasping). I don’t understand you!

MRS. FAYTH. I have had the care of him since he came here. He’s kept me
busy, I can tell you. I am to give him over to you now.... See how he’s
grown! No wonder you didn’t know him.

DR. THORNE (in great agitation). Did Laddie die?

MRS. FAYTH (solemnly). Yes, Laddie died.

DR. THORNE. Did something really ail him that night--that most miserable
night?... Oh, poor Helen! Poor, poor Helen! (His face falls into his
hands. His frame shakes with soundless, tearless sobs.)

LADDIE (creeps into his lap; lays his head on his father’s neck).
Hilloa, Papa! (Pats his father on the cheek.)

[Exit MRS. FAYTH silently, with emotion.

DR. THORNE (raises his head, showing his stormy face. Clasps the child,
hesitatingly at first, then passionately; holds him off at arm’s length;
scans him closely; draws him back; kisses his little hands, then his
face; clasps him again). My little son! Papa’s little boy! My son! My
little son! (Smiles naturally for the first time since he died; then
with sudden recollection, he cries out.) Oh, what will your poor mother
do without you?

LADDIE. You homesick, Papa?

DR. THORNE. My little son! (Caresses the child with a touching
timidity, broken by bursts of wild affection. The child responds warmly,
laughing for joy.)



       END OF SCENE I.


SCENE II.

Dull daylight falls upon a wide and desolate expanse.
This has the appearance of a desert--unbroken and
arid. The horizon is low and heavy with cloud, and
is defined by a tossing sea-line against which no sail
appears. In the distance are cliffs, fissured by dark
cuts, but these are far away, and the foreground is
flat like sand or ashes, or it might be corrugated like
slag. There is no vegetation visible, and no sign of
organized life.

Enter DR. THORNE. (He paces the sands,
mournfully gazing about him at the
lonely scenery. He murmurs, then
raises his voice rhythmically, like one
who quotes from an uncertain memory.)

DR. THORNE.

“A life as hollow as the echo in a cave
 Hid in the heart of an unpeopled world.”

Where did I get that? Oh, I remember. I had not thought of it for years.
That woman used to quote it to me. She was the most consistent infidel I
ever knew. She shied at nothing; took the consequences, both living and
dying.... A shocking death, though! I suppose the boy is all right with
Mrs. Fayth and that little chum of his. If it hadn’t been for that
discussion with Harvey I shouldn’t have left him. Wishing seems to be
doing, in this singular state of existence. A man makes a simple
astronomical inquiry about a planet, and forthwith he is in the planet.
Remarkable! (Breaks off; continues.) How magnificent Helen was about
that affair. If she had doubted me--but she never did. She was superb.

Enter an EVIL SPIRIT. Her garments
are of flame color. Her hair has the
same tint. On her forehead blazes a
single scarlet star. Her appearance
is queenly and confident. As she reveals
her face, it is seen to be that of
the woman whose wraith has followed
DR. THORNE at intervals ever since
the hour of his death. Her robe,
which is opaque, reveals her bare
arms and feet, but covers her shoulders
and bosom with a certain modesty,
which is felt at once to be not
wholly natural to the woman. Each
footprint that she makes upon the
sand is marked by a small jet of
flame, which flares after she has
passed, and dies down quickly. DR.
THORNE stares at the woman in evident
and not well-pleased perplexity.

THE WOMAN (speaks). So? Am I forgotten on first principles? It is some
