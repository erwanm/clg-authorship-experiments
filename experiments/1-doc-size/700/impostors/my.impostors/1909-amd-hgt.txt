dreth had a number of the school folks and 
their wives to dinner, and I do suppose 
lots of turkeys suffered. We didn’t go any- 
where.” 

Helen told them about the two beautiful 
operas, describing the singers and following 
the stories. 




“ Why, it is next to going yourself!” de- 
clared Mrs. Stirling. “ Miss Grant, you do 
make everything so interesting. Do you know, 
sometimes I wish I were a little girl going to 
school to you.” 

“ But when it came to Latin and those awful 
problems, and analysis, you would be glad you 
were grown up,” said the big girl. 

Helen had been used to cliques in college, 
some of them not at all admirable, but they 
seemed quite ridiculous here, with the few in 
number. She had tried earnestly to make them 
fraternize, but the older ones considered them- 
selves young ladies, and quite tabooed the next 
in age. As for the real children she found 
them the most tractable, the most eager to 
learn, ready for any experimental knowledge. 
Some of the boys kept their standing with the 
grammar school ball club. She had tried to 
rouse some enthusiasm among the older ones, 
but it had been severely discouraged and 
laughed at by Eastman, Lang, and Benson. The 
gymnasium training had not been a success 
either except among the younger ones. The 
young ladies complained that the Indian clubs 


 

were too heavy, that the bars roughened one’s 
hands, that the vaulting was unladylike. About 
every other “ gym ” day two or three excuses 
would be brought from the easily persuaded 
mothers. 

“ We are not going to train for athletics,” 
said Georgia Winters. “ I am not booked for 
college, but father thinks I ought to graduate 
here. I’d like to go to some school in New 
York where they train girls for real society 
ladies, and have dancing and afternoon teas 
and all that. I met a girl last summer who was 
at one, and every fortnight they had regular 
parties and could ask in their men friends. 
They don’t say, gentlemen, any more.” 

“ And that’s queer, too. Mr. Conover said 
the other day that Mr. Hildreth was a perfect 
gentleman. I like the term.” 

“ Well, it isn’t fashionable now.” 

“ I think Miss Grant ought to have some 
stylish society ways. I don’t see that college 
training has done much for her, except to make 
her run through the geometry problems like a 
race horse. They might as well be in San- 
scrit.” 


“ What is Sanscrit? ” asked another. 

“ Oh, one of those old dead languages that 
no one ever converses in. Why, we ought to 
be studying French. There’s some fine French 
poetry and — plays.” 

“ Girls ! ” exclaimed Katherine Ford, “ I 


have a splendid idea! Let us form a club. 
They have them in college and they are such 
fun ! ” 

“ Don’t for pity’s sake ask us to read or study 
anything more,” sighed Hattie Dinsmore. 
“ I’m worn out now, and just sick and tired of 
Shakespeare. Could you make anything out 
of ‘ The Tempest ’ ? Mother thought it wasn’t 
the things for girls to read, Miranda falling in 
love as soon as she had seen Ferdinand, with- 
out knowing whether he was respectable or 
not.” 

“ I don’t mean that kind of a club. I’ve read 
in stories where college girls went to each 
other’s rooms at night and made fudge and 
coffee and had lots of goodies. They had a 
chafing dish. I can cook oysters splendidly on 
our chafing dish.” 

“ But we couldn’t come here in the evening. 


 

And cooking doesn’t look very inviting to me. 
Candy-making is better when you ask in the 
boys. Why not have a regular party ? ” 

“ I don’t mean that,” returned Miss Ford 
with dignity. “ It is stylish now to have a club 
where you vote the girls in, and if you don’t 
like any girl you can blackball her and she 
must stay out. I should want it very select. 
And we’d have a password ” 

“ But what would you do ? ” was the query. 

“ Oh, we’d sit around and discuss our likes 
and dislikes, and, well, I don’t just know. 
Men talk politics, but we don’t care about that. 
We might take up the fashions, or read a novel 
and talk about it. Oh, we'd find things to do. 
Let’s hunt up some of the college stories and 
learn what the girls did. There are two or 
three capital ones in the library, but I've for- 
gotten them now.” 

“ Girls, there’s just six minutes to the lan- 
guage lesson, and it’s an awful grind. All 
those words above and under the lines, and re- 
lations and everything, confuse me so that I 
can’t tell whether I’m first cousin to anything 
under the sun or not.” 




“ And to-morrow is composition day and I 
haven’t an idea ” 

“ So hush, and let’s study.” 

The six minutes were up. It was a wretched 
recitation. 

“You will take the same lesson again 
and lose the marks for this,” said Miss Grant 
quietly. 

“ At all events I’ll be primed for to-morrow. 
My composition is done. And you will be so 
surprised ! ” exclaimed Miss Winters. 

It had been very cold since Thanksgiving. 
The two or three flurries of snow had not 
amounted to much, but it was announced that 
Jones’s pond was frozen over hard, and that 
there was splendid skating up the river. 

“ Miss Grant, do you skate? ” asked Lilian, 
as they were walking home. 

“ Indeed I do. It used to be one of our great 
pastimes,” and she experienced a sudden ex- 
hilaration. 

“ Will you go to-morrow? ” 

“ With pleasure.” Helen felt her blood tingle 
at the thought. This might stir up the chil- 
dren. There had been nothing much since the 




day of the fern-gathering. Of course she was 
asked out to tea, but some of the best people 
rather held aloof. They didn’t want to ask 
Miss Parker, or Miss Jaynes, whose father 
was a journeyman carpenter and had worked 
about their houses. They didn’t quite know 
whether they ought to make an exception, and 
Mrs. Eastman’s verdict settled it. But then, 
Helen didn’t particularly like the teas except 
at Mrs. Dean’s and Mrs. Millard’s. She had 
been asked to join an evening whist club, but 
declined. 

It was clear and cold on Saturday, but the 
sun shone with a certain jolly aspect as if he 
was quivering with fun at the blue noses and 
red cheeks he evoked. Jones’s pond was in a 
rather low place between two rises of ground. 
Autumn rains filled it up. Not being very deep, 
it was safe for the children. 

Helen put on her short skirt, her jacket 
trimmed with fur, and her fur cap that had a 
red wing for trimming. 

“ Oh, how handsome you look!” ejaculated 
Lilian. “ I wish I could have a color like that 
and a clear complexion.” 



“ I’m afraid you wouldn't take the trouble,” 
laughed Helen. “ Few good things come with- 
out an effort.” 

“ Why, I'd — what would I have to do?” 

“ There’s the morning bath and a good rub.” 
“ But I wouldn’t have time, truly.” 

“ Oh, yes, you would if you were in real ear- 
nest. And at least one good brisk walk 
through the day. You remember I’ve told you 
you lag too much. You want vim and spirit.” 
“ But you see when things haven’t gone 
right with you, and you don’t just know what 
is best — and — and I never thought study so 
hard. I can get along with the plain 

things ” 

“ Let us walk up now. Throw your shoul- 
ders back and draw long even breaths without 
any effort.” 

“ But it tires me,” rather fretfully. 

“ You would soon get used to it. And I 
wish you would practice with the Indian clubs 
or the dumbbells.” 

Lilian gave a long sigh. 

“ Oh, hear the children!” 

They crossed a stubble field and came in sight 


of the pond. It was half covered with a merry 
throng laughing and shouting. Then some one 
cried, “ Oh, there’s Miss Grant ! ” 

Allen Millard came over to her. “ I’m try- 
ing to teach Ruth to skate,” he said. “ Oh, I’d 
like to see you. May I put on your skates? ” 

“ Why, I’ve been used to waiting on myself. 
In a girls’ college you do not have any beaux,” 
smiling brightly. 

“ But I’d like to,” wistfully. 

“ Very well. I’ll be obliged. You skate? ” 

“ Oh, yes, some. I thought at first I never 
would be able to, and I had to try hard. I 
didn’t like to give up everything: I have only 

one skate on because I can manage better with 
Ruth.” 

“ Thank you ever so much.” She stood up. 

He swung his cap. “ Make way for Miss 
Grant,” he cried joyously. 

“ Come, Lilian.” 

The children fell back a little. Some of them 
flew like birds in a child’s fearless fashion. 
Helen took rather long slow strides at first, 
smiling to the right and left and waving her 
hand, Allen watched her with delight. The 




children paused to look at her. Then she 
caught one little girl by the hand and they 
spun round to the great delight of the others. 

“ Oh me, Miss Grant ! Me next ! ” and some 
eager hands were thrust out. She took one and 
another. 

Lilian skated very well, she saw, and she 
nodded approvingly to her. The pond rang 
with shouts and laughter. Now and then some 
one had a tumble, but the inexperienced ones 
kept near the edge. Presently she glided in and 
sat down on a large stone. She had unfastened 
her jacket but now she closed it again. 

“ Oh, Miss Grant, that was splendid ! Only 
the reaches were not long enough,” Allen ex- 
claimed delightedly. “ I wish you’d go up on 
the river with me. It’s safe enough, for the 
channel is not very deep and it freezes pretty 
hard. If there’s any danger, Mr. Hildreth sends 
his man out to mark it. I can’t skate like that, 
I don’t know that I shall ever be able to, but it 
is so exhilarating. And it’s something you do 
your own self.” 

The boy had a really pretty face with large, 
soft, wistful eyes. 



“ And how does Ruth make out?” 

“ This is the first of her trying, except a little 
bit near the house. She is afraid. Ruth ” 

Ruth came shyly. She was fair-haired with 
round wondering blue eyes. 

“ I want to learn so much,” she said in a 
pleading manner. 

“ And you will in a little while. You are in 
the kindergarten?” 

“ But I’m going in the primary soon. I al- 
most got in last summer, but not quite. And I 
want to get in the high school. Allen thinks it 
so nice.” 

Allen smiled with a little confusion. 

“Oh, Miss Grant, skate again, won’t you? 
You went so splendidly!” cried half a dozen 
voices. 

“ This place is for you little folks. I’m 
afraid I shall run over you.” 

“ Oh no. We will keep off a little. Go just 
as fast as you can. It is like a bird flying.” 

“ A great big bird among a lot of little 
wrens,” she replied laughingly 

But she consented and did her best. The 
children laughed, shouted, and clapped in wild 
Imy^BrocAs. 

Then she caught one little girl by the hand and they 

spun around.

delight. Then she sat down again and they 
gathered around, asking eager questions and 
telling bits about themselves and what they 
were doing. They patted her cap and brushed 
the fur on her coat, and one little tot said : 

“ Oh, I wish you were my teacher, you are 
so pretty ! ” 

Then she began to take off her skates. “ Do 
you think you could go on the river ? ” Allen 
asked pleadingly. “ It's moonlight now, and it 
will be just splendid Monday night if it is 
clear. It’s a long walk.” 

“ Oh, I don’t mind walking. Yes, if it is 
clear. If not, let us say Tuesday.” 

“ Oh, I’m so glad ! ” and the boy’s face 
shone with gladness. “ I think we will go 
home now. Come, Ruth.” 

He picked up her skates and swung them 
over his shoulder. “ Let me carry yours, Miss 
Grant.” 

“ Oh, no,” in a softened tone. 

“ I’d rather,” pleadingly. 

So she allowed him, but she said: 

“ I’m glad you thought of your little sister 
first. That is the mark of a gentleman.” 


 

He blushed with delight. 

Lilian Firth looked the better for her outing. 
She went again with her aunt in the after- 
noon to make some calls, a thing she did not 
like very much. Helen wrote letters in her 
room until Jane said: 

“ Mr. Hildreth is downstairs, Miss Grant, 
and would like to see you.” 

She went down bright and smiling to meet 
him. 

“ I hear you were out on a frolic this morn- 
ing,” he exclaimed, holding her hand. “ I 
have a great mind to ask how old you are just 
now.” 

“ Sixteen!” she replied, with a ripple of 
laughter. “ The little ones were charming. If 
I could only imbue the older ones with as 
much enthusiasm! Is there safe skating on the 
river? ” 

“ Oh, yes, now; will be, if this weather con- 
tinues. There’s plenty of space. From the 
flagpole up it is all right, but I don’t like the 
children to trust it down below, though the 
large boys do. It changes up above the second 
bridge and runs off wild, spreading over the 




country, as you learned the day of the fern 
hunt.” 

“ I had a lovely cavalier this morning and 
he invited me to go skating Monday evening. 
It is the first time a young man has invited me 
out since I have been here.” 

She looked merry and mischievous, as if it 
had not weighed heavily on her mind. 

“ May I ask who the brave man was ? ” 

“ Oh, am I so formidable ? ” She gave a 
gay rippling laugh. “ It’s — well, I think my 
favorite scholar among the boys, Allen Mil- 
lard.” 

“ A fine boy.” 

“ Yes, I wish there were more like him.” 

“ If it is clear and moonlight — one couldn’t 
happen without the other,” a vague smile light- 
ing his face, “ you will have a delightful time. 
Yes, go by all means. And now let us talk 
about your friends. I don't know when I have 
enjoyed anything so much. That little South- 
ern beauty is very fascinating, and the mother 
most delightful. They set at nought the feud 
commonly supposed to affect that relation- 
ship.” 


 

“ Mother Bell is one of the sweetest and best 
of women. She was my dear friend and ad- 
viser in a very dreary and troubled time. And 
her husband was a wise and tender one. I 
should like to have been born into that family, 
and belong to them.” 

Could she not have belonged to them in a 
different relationship, he wondered? For the 
young man evidently had a tender regard for 
her. 

“ Did you live near each other?” he asked 
at a venture. He wanted to hear her talk. 
Her voice had a joyous strain and all its 
inflections were unusually perfect. She 

certainly showed some fine training. And 

the pretty changes in her face were worth 
watching. 

“ Oh, no,” and she gave a retrospective smile. 
“ I was a little country girl and a very kind 
lady sent me to a most admirable school, a real 
home school in a lovely, cultivated old town. I 
met that pretty Daisy they talked about, you 
remember, who had such a brief life. I visited 
her and somehow — you never can tell what 
brings about likes for certain people and indif- 



ference to others who are quite as good and 
worthy.” 

“ And — the young man?” tentatively. 

“ Oh, Willard? We were such friends. My 
father had set me to learning Greek in a hard, 
dry way, and Willard helped me over rough 
places. He studied law and will some day be a 
member of his firm. He used to come up to 
college — we could have our friends, you know, 
and I had taken up Shirley Chardavoyne, who 
was fine in some things and very deficient in 
others. And she fell in love with me, — girls 
do that quite often, you know, but this was a 
very real love and she wrote me beautiful 
verses. She is a poet. And Willard fell in 
love with her. It was natural,” with a soft, en- 
trancing laugh. 

There was none of that kind of love between 
them, he decided, or she would have shown a 
different feeling, flushed a little perhaps. He 
wondered why he felt glad that it was so. 

“ Tell me about your father. There is a book 
dedicated to his memory. Why, he was a 
great scholar ! ” 

There were many things she could relate 


 

without touching upon infelicities, such as his 
last friendship with the Reverend Mr. Walters, 
and his death that in a way was serene. 

“ I am glad you did not go to London,” he 
said in a very earnest tone. “ It would have 
been no kind of life for a young girl — for 
you,” with a fervent emphasis. 

“ Oh, I didn’t want to go. It was then Mrs. 
Bell comforted me so much. I never can be 
grateful enough to her.” 

“ And about Hope ? What sort of a town 
was that?” He did enjoy her talk. She 
neither put herself in the foreground nor held 
herself back; her impersonal manner held him 
with a charm. 

It was getting dusky. She heard Jane be- 
ginning with the tea things. 

“ We must have a light,” she exclaimed, ris- 
ing. “And oh, there comes Mrs. Stirling!” 

That lady and her niece had had a rather 
pleasant time calling. She came in with pink 
cheeks and bright eyes, and greeted her visitor 
cordially. 

Mr. Hildreth declared presently that he 
must return home. 


“No, you must stay and have a cup of tea 
with us,” said Mrs. Stirling persuasively. “ It 
has been so long since you have dropped in to 
tea.” 

“ I do not think I will need much coaxing. 
I sometimes tire of my own solitary meals 
when I have no guests.” 

Then they discussed neighborhood matters 
and the coming Christmas, church festivities, 
Christmas trees, and the new proprietor of the 
paper mill who was putting in up-to-date ma- 
chinery, and who had purchased the old Craw- 
ford house and was having that put in order. 

“ There are five or six children,” he said, 
“ some quite large, and they may be a new 
trial for you, Miss Grant,” with a rather hu- 
morous expression. 

Helen noticed that he made no reference to 
the Thanksgiving visit. Did she quite like 
having secrets with him? Yet she liked him 
very much. 


CHAPTER X 


SOWING BESIDE ALL WAYS 

Helen overruled Lilian Firth’s objections 
and she was ready to accompany her on the 
skating expedition. Helen felt she had been a 
little rash in promising, but the splendid ex- 
ercise had tempted her. 

“ Do you suppose there will be any other 
venturesome people out?” she asked of Allen. 

“ Oh, lots of them. And Mr. Hildreth said 
to skate along the edge soon after we passed 
the first bridge. It will shorten the walk a 
good deal.” 

They picked their way down. The going 
was rather rough. Here was where she had 
crossed over the day she felt so lonesome and 
tired, and had run away and met with an ad- 
venture. She laughed softly to herself. But 
her sympathies went warmly out to the boy 
with a little limp, who trudged along buoy- 
antly. 


 

It was a glorious night with a full moon that 
silvered the leafless twigs and made great 
reaches of whitened meadow-land that sug- 
gested snow. It sparkled on the river as if it 
were sown with diamonds. The air had soft- 
ened and there was no wind. 

“ It will snow in a day or two,” said Lilian. 

“ It is in the air.” 

* 

“ Oh, I hope not! ” cried Allen. 

“ But there is grand fun in a snowstorm and 
after,” declared Helen. 

“ We can put on our skates here,” began the 
boy. 

“ Now you must allow me to wait upon my- 
self,” protested Helen, and while they were 
making ready several others came up. Helen 
knew two of the girls and with them was their 
mother, Mrs. Ridley. 

“ Lm glad to know you, Miss Grant. And 
I am doubly glad that you skate. You will set 
a good example to our supersensitive young 
ladies. Of course you know some of the doc- 
tors say that a girl should never skate, but Tve 
done it ever since I was seven. I’ve had four 
children, I do my own housekeeping, and a 


 

good deal of spring gardening. I’m round and 
rosy, I have no fads about eating, I am never 
ill and very rarely take a cold. We women do 
not get out of doors enough, dawdle too much. 
You want to keep your blood in circulation. 
Come, girls ! ” 

“Hello, Miss Grant! I had half a mind 
to ask you to-day if you didn’t want to join a 
skating party, but I wasn’t quite sure I should 
go myself. Mrs. Underwood doesn’t skate, 
more’s the pity. And she has a cold. But the 
night was so fine I couldn’t resist. Well, 
Allen! And Miss Firth! Isn’t that Mrs. Rid- 
ley ahead? She’s the champion skater of the 
county, I think.” 

“ I had an invitation,” announced Helen 
laughingly. “ And it is one of my pleasures.” 

“ It’s a fine country amusement, worlds bet- 
ter than playing bridge in a warm room.” 

They started off. Helen was truly glad to 
see Mr. Underwood. Lilian and he spun on 
ahead. Helen held in a little for Allen’s sake. 

After the turn in the river they saw quite 
a throng ahead of them. Here the river wid- 
ened out again, but was rather shallow.
