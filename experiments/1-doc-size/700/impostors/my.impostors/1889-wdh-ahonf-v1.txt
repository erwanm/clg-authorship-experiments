centre of the table, and lit a cigarette, which he 
began to smoke, throwing his head back "with a 
leisurely effect, as if he had got to the end of at least 
as much of his story as he meant to tell -without 
prompting. 

March asked him the desired question. "What 
in the world for ? " 

Fulkerson took out his cigarette and said, witli a 
smile : " To spend his money, and get his daughters 
into the old Knickerbocker society. May be he 
thought they were all the same kind of Dutch." 

"And has he succeeded ? " 

" Well, they 're not social leaders yet. But it 's 
only a question of time — generation or two — espe- 
cially if time 's money, and if Every Other Week is 
the success it's bound to be." 

" You don't mean to say, Fulkerson," said March, 
with a half doubting, half-daunted laugh, "that Ite's 
your Angel '? " 

"That's what I mean to say," returned Fulkerson. 
" I ran onto him in Broadway one day last summer. 
If you ever saw anybody in your life, yovL 're sure to 
meet him in Broadway again, sooner or later. That 's 
the philosophy of the bunco business; country 
people from the same neighbourhood are sure to run 
up against each other the first time they come Jto 
New York. I put out my hand, and I said, ' Isn't 
this Mr. Dryfoos from Moffitt I ' He didn't seem to 
have any use for my hand ; he let me keep it, and 



 

he squared those old lips of his till his imperial stuck 
straight out. Ever see Bernhardt in L'Eiraiujhe ? 
Well, the American husband is old Dryfoos all over ; 
no moustache, and hay-coloured chin-whiskers cut 
slanting from the corners of his mouth. He cocked 
his little gray eyes at me, and says he, ' Yes, young 
man. My name is Dryfoos, and I 'm from Moffitt. 
But I don't want no present of Longfellow's Works, 
illustrated ; and I don't want to taste no fine teas ; 
Ijut I know a policeman that does ; and if you 're 
the son of my old friend Squire Strohfeldt, you 'd 
better get out.' ' Well, then,' said I, ' how would 
you like to go into the newspaper syndicate busi- 
ness ?' He gave another look at me, and then he 
burst out laughing, and he grabbed my hand, and 
he just froze to it. I never saw anybody so glad. 

" Well, the long and the short of it was that I 
asked him round here to Maroni's to dinner ; and 
before we broke up for the night we had settled the 
financial side of the plan that's brought you to New 
York. I can see," said Fulkerson, who had kept his 
eyes fast on Mai'ch's face, "that you don't more than 
half like the idea of Dryfoos. It ought to give you 
more confidence in the thing than you ever had. 
You needn't be afraid," he added, with some feeling, 
" that I talked Dryfoos into the thing for my own 
advantage." 

" Oh, my dear Fulkerson ! " March protested, all 
the more fervently because he was really a little 
guilty. 

" Well, of course not ! I didn't mean you were. 



? IG A HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES. 

But I just happened to tell him what I wanted to 
go ijito when I could sec my way to it, and he caught 
on of his own accord. The fact is," said Fulkerson, 
" I guess I 'd better make a clean breast of it, now 
I 'm at it. Dryfoos wanted to get something for 
that boy of his to do. He's in railroads himself, 
and he 's in mines and other things, and he keeps 
busy, and he can't bear to have his boy hanging 
round the house doing nothing, like as if he was a 
girl. I told him that the great object of a rich man 
was to get his son into just that fix, but he couldn't 
seem to see it, and the boy hated it himself. He 's 
got a good head, and he wanted to study for the 
ministry when they were all living together out on 
the farm ; but his father had the old-fashioned ideas 
about that. You know they used to think that any 
sort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher 
out of ; but they wanted the good timber for busi- 
ness ; and so the old man wouldn't let him. You 'll 
see the fellow ; you 'll like him ; he 's no fool, I can 
tell you ; and he 's going to be our publisher, 
nominally at first and actually when I 've taught 
him the ropes a little." 



xir. 

FULKERSON stopped and looked at March, whom 
he saw lapsing into a serious silence. Doubtless he 
divined his uneasiness with the facts that had been 
given him to digest. He pulled out his watch and 
glanced at it. " See here, how would you like to go 
up to Forty-sixth Street with me, and drop in on 
old Dryfoos ? Now 's your chance. He 's going 
"West to-morrow, and won't be back for a month or 
so. They 'll all be glad to see you, and you 'll 
understand things better when you 've seen him and 
his family. I can't explain." 

March reflected a moment. Then he said, with a 
wisdom that surprised him, for he would have liked 
to yield to the impulse of his curiosity : " Perhaps 
we 'd better wait till Mrs. March comes down, and 
let things take the usual course. The Dryfoos 
ladies will want to call on her as the last-comer, and 
if I treated myself en garon now, and paid the first 
visit, it might complicate matters." 

"Well, perhaps you're right," said Fulkerson. 
" I don't know much about these things, and I don't 
believe Ma Dryfoos does either." He was on his 
legs lighting another cigarette. "I suppose the 

 

girls are getting tlicmsclvcs up in etiquette, though. 
Well, then, let 's have a look at the Every Other Week 
building, and then, if you like your quarters there, 
you can go round and close for Mrs. Green's fiat." 

March's dormant allegiance to his wife's M'ishes 
had been roused by his decision in favour of good 
social usage. " I don't think I shall take the Hat," 
he said. 

""Well, don't reject it "without giving it another 
look, anyway. Come on ! " 

He helped March on with his light overcoat, and 
the little stir they made for their departure caught 
the notice of the old German ; he looked up from 
his beer at them. March was more than ever 
impressed with something familiar in his face. In 
compensation for his prudence in regard to the 
Dryfooses he now indulged an impulse. He stepped 
across to where the old man sat, with his bald head 
.shining like ivory vmder the gas-jet, and his fine 
patriarchal length of bearded mask taking picturesque 
lights and shadows, and put out his hand to him. 

'' Lindau- ! Isn't this Mr. Lindau ? " 

The old man lifted himself slowly to his feet witli 
mechanical politeness, and cautiously took March's 
hand. " Yes, my name is Lindau," he said slowh', 
while he scanned IMarch's face. Then he broke into 
a long cry "Ah-h-h-h-h, my dear poy ! my yong 

friendt ! my — my Idt is Passil Marge, not zo ? 

Ah, ha, ha, ha ! How gladt I am to zee you ! Why, 
I am gladt ! And you rcmemberdt me ? You 
remember Schiller, and Goethe, and Uhland ? And 




Indianapolis ? You still lif in Indianapolis ? It 
sheers my hardt to zee you. But you are lidtle oldt 
too ? Tventy-fivc years makes a difference. Ah, I 
am gladt ! Dell me, idt is Passil Marge, not zo ? " 

He looked anxiously into March's face, with a 
gentle smile of mixed hope and doubt, and March 
said : "As sure as it's Berthold Lindau, and I guess 
it 's you. And you remember the old times ? You 
were as much of a boy as I was, Lindau. Are you 
living in New York ? Do you recollect how you 
tried to teach me to fence ? I don't know how 
to this day, Lindau. How good you were, and how 
patient ! Do you remember how we used to sit up 
in the little parlour back of your printing office, and 
read Die Fiduhcr and Die Thcilung dcr Ercle and Die 
Glocke ? And JMrs. Lindau ? Is she with " 

"Deadt — deadt long ago. Eight after I got 
home from the war — tventy years ago. But tell 
me, you are married ? Children ? Yes ! Goodt ! 
And how oldt are you now % " 

" It makes me seventeen to see you, Lindau, but 
I 've got a son nearly as old." 

" Ah, ha, ha ! Goodt ! And where do you 
lif ? " 

"Well, I'm just coming to live in New York," 
March said, looking over at Fulkerson, who had 
been M'atching his interview with the perfunctory 
smile of sympathy that people put on at the meet- 
ing of old friends. " I want to introduce you to my 
friend Mr. Fulkerson. He and I are going into a 
literary enterprise here." 



 

" Ah I zo ? " said the old man, with pohte interest. 
He took Fulkerson's proffered hand, and they all 
stood talking a few moments together. 

Then Fulkerson said, with another look at his 
watch, " "Well, JMarch, we 're keeping Mr. Lindau 
from his dinner." 

"Dinner!" cried the old man. "Idt's better 
than breadt and meadt to see Mr. Marge ! " 

" I must be going, anyway," said March. " But I 
must see you again soon, Lindau. Where do you 
live ? I want a long talk." 

"And I. You will find me here at dinner-time," 
said the old man. '' It is the best place ;" and March 
fancied him reluctant to give another address. 

To cover his consciousness he answered gaily, 
'' Then, it 's auf iciedersehcn with us. Well ! " 

''Aho ! " The old man took his hand, and made 
a mechanical movement with his mutilated arm, as 
if he would have taken it in a double clasp. He 
laughed at himself. "I wanted to gif you the 
other handt too, but I gafe it to your gountry a 
goodt while ago." 

" To my country ? " asked March, with a sense of 
pain, and yet lightly, as if it were a joke of the old 
man's. " Your country too, Lindau ? " 

The old man turned very grave, and said, almost 
coldly, " What gountry hass a poor man got, Mr. 
IMarge ? " 

" Well, you ought to have a share in the one you 
helped to save for us rich men, Lindau," March re- 
turned, still humouring the joke. 



 

The old man smiled sadly, but made no answer as 
he sat down again. 

" Seems to be a little soured," said Fulkerson, as 
they went down the steps. He was one of those 
Americans M'hose habitual conception of life is 
unalloyed prosperity. when any experience or 
observation of his went counter to it he suffered 
something like physical pain. He eagerly shrugged 
away the impression left upon his buoyancy by 
Lindau, and added to March's continued silence, 
" "What did I tell you about meeting every man in 
New York that you ever knew before ? " 

" I never expected to meet Lindau in the world 
again," said March, more to himself than to Fulker- 
son. " I had an impression that he had been killed 
in the war. I almost wish he had been." 

" Oh, hello, now ! " cried Fulkerson. 

March laughed, but went on soberly. " He was a 
man predestined to adversity, though. "When I 
first knew him out in Indianapolis he was starving 
along with a sick wife and a sick newspaper. It 
was before the Germans had come over to the 
Eepublicans generally, but Lindau was fighting the 
anti-slavery battle just as naturally at Indianapolis 
in 1858 as he fought behind the barricades at Berlin 
in 1848. And yet he was always such a gentle soul ! 
And so generous ! He taught me German for the 
love of it; he wouldn't spoil his pleasure by taking 
a cent from me ; he seemed to get enough out of 
my being young and enthusiastic, and out of 
prophesying great things for me. I wonder what 

 

the poor old fellow is doing here, with that one 
hand of his ? " 

"Not amassing a very handsome pittance, I 
should say," said Fullcerson, getting back some of 
his lightness. " There are lots of two-handed fellows 
in New York that are not doing much hotter, I 
guess. May be he gets some writing on the German 
papers. " 

"I hope so. He's one of the most accomplished 
men ! He used to be a splendid musician — pianist 
— and knows eight or ten languages." 

"Well, it's astonishing," said Fulkerson, "how 
much lumber those Germans ean carry around in 
their heads all their lives, and never work it up into 
anything. It 's a pity they couldn't do the acrpiiring, 
and let out the use of their learning to a few bright 
Americans. "\Vc could make things hum, if we could 
arrange 'em that way." 

He talked on, unheeded by !March, who went 
along half-consciously tormented by his lightness in 
the pensive memories the meeting with Lindau had 
called up. "Was this all that sweet, unselfish nature 
could come to ? What a homeless old age at that 
meagre Italian table (Fhote, with that tall glass of 
beer for a half-hour's oblivion ! That shabby dress, 
that pathetic mutilation ! He must have a pension, 
twelve dollars a month, or eighteen, from a grateful 
country. But what else did he eke out with ? 

"Well, here we are," said Fulkerson cheerily. 
He ran up the steps before March, and opened the 
carpenter's temporary valve in the door frame, and 



 

led the way into a darkness smelling sweetly of 
unpainted wood-work and newly dried plaster ; their 
feet slipped on shavings and grated on sand. He 
scratched a match, and found a candle, and then 
walked about up and down stairs, and lectured on 
the advantages of the place. He had fitted up 
bachelor apartments for himself in the house, and 
said that he "was going to have a flat to let on the 
top floor. " I didn't offer it to you because I supposed 
you 'd be too proud to live over your shop ; and it 's 
too small, anyway ; only five rooms." 

" Yes, that 's too small," said March, shirking the 
other point. 

'' Well, then, here 's the room I intend for your 
office," said Fulkerson, showing him into a large back 
parlour one flight up. " You 'll have it quiet from 
the street noises here, and you can be at home or 
not as you please. There 'll be a boy on the stairs 
to find out. Now, you see, this makes the Grosvenor 
Green flat practicable, if you want it." 

March felt the forces of fate closing about him 
and pushing him to a decision. He feebly fought 
them off till he could have another look at the flat. 
Then, baffled and subdued still more by the unex- 
pected presence of Mrs. Grosvenor Green herself, 
who was occupying it so as to be able to show it 
effectively, he took it. He was aware more than 
ever of its absurdities ; he knew that his wife would 
never cease to hate it ; but he had suffered one of 
those eclijises of the imagination to which men of 
his temperament are subject, and in which he could 



 

see no future for his desires. He felt a comfort in 
iiTetrievably committing himself, and exchanging the 
burden of indecision for the burden of responsibility. 

" I didn't Icnow," said Fulkerson, as they walked 
back to his hotel together, " but you might fix it up 
with that lone widow and her pretty daughter to 
take part of their house here." He seemed to be 
reminded of it by the fact of passing the house, and 
March looked up at its dark front. He could not 
have told exactly why he felt a pang of remorse at 
the sight, and doubtless it was more regret for 
having taken the Grosvenor Green fiat than for not 
having taken the widow's rooms. Still he could not 
forget her wistfulness when his wife and he were 
looking at them, and her disappointment when they 
decided against them. He had toyed, in his after- 
talk to Mrs. March, with a sort of hypothetical 
obligation they had to modify their plans so as to 
meet the widow's want of just such a family as 
theirs ; the}' had both said what a blessing it would 
?)e to her, and what a pity they could not do it ; 
but they had decided very distinctly that they 
could not. Now it seemed to him that they might ; 
and he asked himself whether he had not actually 
departed as much from their ideal as if he had taken 
board with the widow, Suddenly it seemed to him 
that his AA'ifo asked him this too. 

"I reckon," said Fulkerson, " that she could haA'e 
arranged to give you your meals in your rooms, and 
it would have come to about the same thing as 
house-keeping." 



 

"No sort of boarding can be the same as house- 
keeping," said March. "I want my little girl to 
have the run of a kitchen, and I want the whole 
family to have the moral effect of house-keeping. 
It's demoralising to board, in every way; it isn't 
a home, if anybody else takes the care of it off your 
hands." 

" Well, I suppose so," Fulkerson assented ; but 
March's words had a hollow ring to himself, and in 
his own mind he began to retaliate his dissatisfac- 
tion upon Fulkerson. 

He parted from him on the usual terms out- 
wardly, but he felt obscurely abused by Fulkerson 
in regard to the Dryfooses, father and son. He did 
not know but Fulkerson had taken an advantage of 
him in allowing him to commit himself to their en- 
terprise AA'ithout fully and frankly telling him who 
and what Iris backer was ; he perceived that with 
young Dryfoos as the publisher and Fulkerson as 
the general director of the paper there might be 
very little play for his own ideas of its conduct. 
Perhaps it was the hurt to his vanity involved by 
the recognition of this fact that made liim forget how 
little choice he really had in the matter, and how, 
since he had not accepted the offer to edit the in- 
surance paper, nothing remained for him but to 
close with Fulkerson. In this moment of suspicion 
and resentment he accused Fulkerson of hastening 
his decision in regard to the Grosvenor Green apart- 
ment ; he now refused to consider it a decision, and 
said to himself that if he felt disposed to do so he 



 

vvoukl send INIrs. Green a note reversing it in the 
morning. But he put it all off till morning with his 
clothes, when he went to bed ; he jnit off even think- 
ing what his wife would say ; he cast Fulkerson and 
his constructive treachery out of his mind too, and 
invited into it some pensive reveries of the past, 
when he still stood at the parting of the ways, and 
could take this path or that. In his middle life this 
was not possible ; he must follow the path chosen 
long ago, wherever it led. He was not master of 
himself, as he once seemed, but the servant of those 
he loved ; if he could do what he liked, perhaps 
he might renounce this whole New York enterprise, 
and go off somewhere out of the reach of care ; but 
he could not do what he liked, that was very clear. 
In the pathos of this conviction he dwelt compassion- 
ately upon the thought of poor old Lindau ; he 
resolved to make him accept a handsome sum of 
money — more than he could spare, something that 
he would feel the loss of — in payment of the lessons 
in German and fencing given so long ago. At the 
usual rate for such lessons, his debt, with interest 
for twenty odd }'ears, would run very far into the 
hundreds. Too far, he perceived, for his wife's 
joyous approval ; he determined not to add the 
interest ; or he believed that Lindau would refuse 
the interest; he put a fine speech in his mouth, 
making him do so ; and after that he got Lindau 
employment on Every Other Week, and took care of 
him till he died. 

Through all his melancholv and munificence he 




was aware of sordid anxieties for having taken the 
Grosvenor Green apartment. These began to as- 
sume visible, tangible shapes as he drowsed, and to 
become personal entities, from which he woke, with 
little starts, to a realisation of their true nature, and 
then suddenly fell fast asleep. 

In the accomi)lishment of the events which his 
reverie played with, there was much that retroac- 
tively stamped it with prophecy, but much also 
that AA-as better than he forboded. He found that 
with regard to the Grosvenor Green apartment he 
had not allowed for his wife's willingness to get any 
sort of roof over her head again after the removal 
from their old home, or for the alleviations that 
grow up through mere custom. The practical work- 
ings of the apartment were not so bad ; it had its 
good points, and after the first sensation of oppres- 
sion in it they began to feel the convenience of its 
arrangement. They were at that time of life when 
people first turn to their children's opinion with 
deference, and, in the loss of keenness in their Own 
likes and dislikes, consult the young preferences 
which are still so sensitive. It went far to reconcile 
Mrs. March to the apartment that her children were 
pleased with its novelty ; When this wore off for 
them, she had herself begun to find it much more 
easily manageable than a house. After she had put 
aAAay scA'eral barrels of gimcracks, and folded up 
screens and rugs and skins, and carried them all off to 
the little dark store-room which the flat developed, 
she perceived at once a roominess and cozincss in it 



 

unsuspected before. Then, when people began to 
call, she had a pleasure, a superiority, in saying that 
it was a furnished apartment, and in disclaiming all 
responsibility for the upholstery and decoration. If 
Alarch "was by, slic ahvays explained that it was 
Mr. March's fancy, and amiably laughed it off with 
her callers as a mannish eccentricity. Nobody really 
seemed to think it otherwise than pretty ; and this 
again was a triumph for !Mrs. March, because it 
showed how inferior the New York taste was to the 
Boston taste in such matters. 

March submitted silently to his punishment, and 
laughed with her before company at his own eccen- 
tricity. She had been so preoccupied with the 
adjustment of the family to its new quarters and 
circumstances that the time passed for laying his 
misgivings, if they were misgivings, about Fulkerson 
before her, and when an occasion came for express- 
ing them they had themselves passed in the anxieties 
of getting forward the first number of Every Other 
JFeeh. He kept these from her too, and the business 
that brought them to New York had apparently 
dropped into abeyance before the Cjuestions of 
domestic economy that presented and absented 
themselves. March knew his wife to be a woman 
of good mind and in perfect sympathy with him, 
but he understood the limitations of her perspective ; 
and if he was not too wise, he was too ex})erienced 
to intrude upon it any affairs of his till her own 
were reduced to the right order and proportion. It 
would have been folly to talk to her of Fulkerson's 




conjecturable uiicandour while she was in doubt 
whether her cook would like the kitchen, or her two 
servants would consent to room together ; and till it 
was decided what school Tom should go to, and 
whether Bella should have lessons at home or not, 
the relation which March was to bear to the Dry- 
fooses, as owner and publisher, was not to be dis- 
cussed with his wife. He might drag it in, but he 
was aware that with her mind distracted by more 
immediate interests he could not get from her that 
judgment, that reasoned divination, which he relied 
upon so much. She would try, she would do her 
best, but the result would be a view clouded and 
discoloured by the effort she must make. 

He put the whole matter by, and gave himself to 
the details of the work before him. In this he found 
not only escape, but reassurance, for it became more 
and more apparent that whatever was nominally the 
structure of the business, a man of his qualifications 
and his instincts could not have an insignificant 
place in it. He had also the consolation of liking 
his work, and of getting an instant grasp of it that 
grew constantly firmer and closer. The joy of 
knowing that he had not made a mistake was great. 
In giving rein to ambitions long forborne he seemed 
to get back to the youth when he had indulged them 
first; and after half a lifetime passed in pursuits 
alien to his nature, he was feeling the serene happi- 
ness of being mated through his work to his early 
love. From the outside the spectacle might have 
had its patlios, and it is not easy to justify such an 


experiment as he had made at his time of life, except 
upon the ground where he rested from its con- 
sideration — the ground of necessity. 

His work was more in his thoughts than himself, 
however, and as the time for the publication of the 
first number of his periodical came nearer, his cares 
all centred upon it. Without fixing any date, 
Fulkerson had announced it, and pushed his 
announcements with the shameless vigour of a born 
advertiser, lie wnrked his interest with the press 
to the utmost, and paragraphs of a variety that did 
credit to his ingenuity were afloat everywhere. 
Some of them were speciously unfavourable in tone ; 
they criticised and even ridiculed the principles on 
which the new departure in literary journalism was 
based. Others defended it ; others yet denied that 
this rumoured principle was really the principle. 
All contributed to make talk. All proceeded from 
the same fertile invention. 

March observed with a degree of mortification 
that the talk was very little of it in the New York 
pres'; there the references to the novel enterprise 
were slight and cold. But Fulkerson said : " Don't 
mind that, old man. It's the whole country that 
makes or breaks a thing like this ; Ncav York has 
very little to do with it. Now if it were a play, 
it would be different. New York does make or 
break a play ; but it doesn't make or break a book ; 
it doesn't make or break a magazine. The great 
mass of the readers are outside of New York, and 
the rural districts are what we have got to go for. 



 

They don't read much in New York ; they -write, 
and talk about what they 've written. Don't you 
worry." 

The rumour of Fulkerson's connection with the 
enterprise accompanied many of the paragraphs, and 
he was able to stay March's thirst for employment 
by turning over to him from day to day heaps of 
the manuscripts which began to pour in from his 
old syndicate writers, as well as from adventurous 
volunteers all over the country. With these in 
hand March began practically to plan the first 
number, and to concrete a general scheme from the 
material and the experience they furnished. They 
had intended to issue the first number with the new 
year, and if it had been an affair of literature alone, 
it would have been very easy ; but it was the art 
leg they limped on, as Fulkerson phrased it. They 
had not merely to deal with the question of specific 
illustrations for this article or that, but to decide the 
whole character of their illustrations, and first of all 
to get a design for a cover which should both 
ensnare the heedless and captivate the fastidious. 
These things did not come properly within March's 
province — that had been clearly understood — and 
for a while Fulkerson tried to run the art leg him- 
self. The phrase was again his, but it was simpler 
to make the phrase than to run the leg. The diffi- 
cult generation, at once stiff-backed and slippery, 
with which he had to do in this endeavour, reduced 
even so buoyant an optimist to despair, and after 
wasting some valuable weeks in trying to work the 



 

artists himself, lie determined to get an artist to 
work them. But what artist ? It could not be a 
man with fixed reputation and a following : he 
would bo too costly, and would have too many 
enemies among his brethren, even if he would con- 
sent to undertake the job. Fulkerson had a man in 
mind, an artist too, m'Iio would have been the very 
thing if he had been the thing at all. He had 
talent enough, and his sort of talent would reach 
round the whole situation, but, as Fulkerson said, 
he was as many kinds of an ass as he was kinds of 
an artist. 



PART SECOND. 



The evening when March closed with Mrs. Green's 
reduced offer, and decided to take her apartment, 
the widow whose lodgings he had rejected sat with 
her daughter in an upper room at the back of her 
house. In the shaded glow of the drop-light she 
was sewing, and the girl was drawing at the same
