just worshipped the baby ! I neva saw her take a 
child in her ahms before ; but she seemed to want to 
hold the baby all the time." She stopped, and then 
added, tenderly, " Now, I know what you ah thinking 
about, Geo ge, and I don 't want you to think about it 
any more. If you do, I shall give up." 

They had come to a bad piece of road where a 
slough of thick mud forced the wagon-way over the 
stumps of a turnout in the woods. " You had better 
let me have the reins, Clementina," he said. He 
drove home over the yellow leaves of the hickories 
and the crimson leaves of the maples, that heavy with 
the morning dew, fell slanting through the still air; 
and on the way he began to sing ; his singing made 
her heart ache. His father came out to put up the 
colt for him ; and Hinkle would not have his help. 



 

He unhitched the colt himself, while his father trembled 
by with bent knees ; he clapped the colt on the haunch 
and started him through the pasture-bars with a gay 
shout, and then put his arm round Clementina 's waist, 
and walked her into the kitchen amidst the grins of his 
mother and sisters, who said he ought to be ashamed. 

The winter passed, and in the spring he was not so 
well as he had been in the fall. It was the out-door 
life which was best for him, and he picked up again 
in the summer. When another autumn came, it was 
thought best for him not to risk the confinement of 
another winter in the North. The prolongation of 
the summer in the South would complete his cure, 
and Clementina took her baby and went with him to 
Florida. He was very well, there, and courageous 
letters came to Middlemount and Ohio, boasting of 
the gains he had made. One day toward spring he 
came in languid from the damp, unnatural heat, and 
the next day he had a fever, which the doctor would 
not, in a resort absolutely free from malaria, pronounce 
malarial. After it had once declared itself, in com 
pliance with this reluctance, a simple fever, Hinkle 
was delirious, and he never knew Clementina again 
for the mother of his child. They were once more at 
Venice in his ravings, and he w r as j-easoning with her 
that Bel sky was not drowned. 

The mystery of his malady deepened into the mys 
tery of his death. AVith that his look of health and 
youth came back, and as she gazed upon his gentle 
face, it wore to her the smile of quaint sweetness that 
she had seen it wear the first night it won her fancy 
at Miss Milray 's house in Florence. 



XXXIX. 

Six years after Miss Milray parted with Clemen 
tina in Venice she found herself, towards the close 
of the summer, at Middlemount. She had definitely 
ceased to live in Florence, where she had meant to 
die, and had come home to close her eyes. She was 
in no haste to do this, and in the meantime she was 
now at Middlemount with her brother, who had ex 
pressed a wish to revisit the place in memory of Mrs. 
Milray. It was the second anniversary of her divorce, 
which had remained, after a married life of many 
vicissitudes, almost the only experience untried in 
that relation, and which had been happily accom 
plished in the courts of Dacotah, upon grounds that 
satisfied the facile justice of that State. Milray had 
dealt handsomely with his widow, as he unresentfully 
called her, and the money he assigned her was of a 
destiny perhaps as honored as its origin. She em 
ployed it in the negotiation of a second marriage, in 
which she redressed the balance of her first by taking 
a husband somewhat younger than herself. 

Both Milray and his sister had a wish which was 
much more than a curiosity to know what had become 



 

of Clementina ; they had heard that her husband was 
dead, and that she had come back to Middlemount ; 
and Miss Milray was going to the office, the afternoon 
following their arrival, to ask the landlord about her, 
when she was arrested at the door of the ball-room by 
a sight that she thought very pretty. At the bottom 
of the room, clearly defined against the long windows 
behind her, stood the figure of a lady in the middle 
of the floor. In rows on either side sat little girls 
and little boys who left their places one after another, 
and turned at the door to make their manners to her. 
In response to each obeisance the lady dropped a 
curtsey, now to this side, now to that, taking her skirt 
between her finger tips on either hand and spreading 
it delicately, with a certain elegance of movement, and 
a grace that was full of poetry, and to Miss Milray, 
somehow, full of pathos. There remained to the end 
a small mite of a girl, who was the last to leave her 
place and bow to the lady. She did not quit the 
room then, like the others, but advanced toward the 
lady who came to meet her, and lifted her and clasped 
her to her breast with a kind of passion. She walked 
down toward the door where Miss Milray stood, gently 
drifting over the polished floor, as if still moved by 
the music that had ceased, and as she drew near, Miss 
Milray gave a cry of joy, and ran upon her. " Why, 
Clementina ! " she screamed, and caught her and the 
child both in her arms. 

She began to weep, but Clementina smiled instead 
of weeping, as she always used to do. She returned 
Miss Milray 's affectionate greeting with a tenderness 



 

as great as her own, but with a sort of authority, such 
as sometimes comes to those who have suffered. She 
quieted the older woman with her own serenity, and 
met the torrent of her questions with as many answers 
as their rush permitted, when they were both pres 
ently in Miss Milray 's room talking in their old way. 
From time to time Miss Milray broke from the talk to 
kiss the little girl, whom she declared to be Clemen 
tina all over again, and then returned to her better 
behavior with an effect of shame for her want of self- 
control, as if Clementina 's mood had abashed her. 
Sometimes this was almost severe in its quiet ; that 
was her mother coming to her share in her ; but again 
she was like her father, full of the sunny gayety of 
self-forgetfulness, and then Miss Milray said, " Now 
you are the old Clementina ! " 

Upon the whole she listened with few interruptions 
to the story which she exacted. It was mainly what 
we know. After her husband 's death Clementina had 
gone back to his family for a time, and each year 
since she had spent part of the winter with them ; but 
it was very lonesome for her, and she began to be 
home-sick for Middlemount. They saw it and con 
sidered it. " They ah the best people, Miss Milray ! " 
she said, and her voice, which was firm when she 
spoke of her husband, broke in the words of minor 
feeling. Besides being a little homesick, she ended, 
she was not willing to live on there, doing nothing 
for herself, and so she had come back. 

" And you are here, doing just what you planned 
when you talked your life over with me in Venice ! " 



 

" Yes, but life isn 't eva just what we plan it to be, 
Miss Milray." 

" Ah, don 't I know it ! " 

Clementina surprised Miss Milray by adding, " In 
a great many things I don 't know but in most it 's 
better. I don 't complain of mine " 

" You poor child ! You never complained of any 
thing not even of Mrs. Lander ! " 

" But it 's different from what I expected ; and it 's 
strange." 

"Yes; life is very strange." 

" I don 't mean losing him. That had to be. I 
can see, now, that it had to be almost from the begin 
ning. It seems to me that I knew it had to be from 
the fust minute I saw him in Xevv Yo k ; but he didn t, 
and I am glad of that. Except when he was getting 
wohse, he always believed he should get well ; and he 
was getting well, when he " 

Miss Milray did not violate the pause she made 
with any question, though it was apparent that Clem 
entina had something on her mind that she wished to 
say, and could hardly say of herself. 

She began again, " I was glad through everything 
that I could live with him so long. If there is noth 
ing moa, here or anywhe a, that was something. But 
it is strange. Sometimes it doesn 't seem as if it had 
happened." 

" I think I can understand, Clementina." 

" I feel sometimes as if I hadn 't happened myself." 
She stopped, with a patient little sigh, and passed her 
hand across the child 's forehead, in a mother 's fashion, 



 

and smoothed her hair from it, bending over to look 
down into her face. " We think she has her fatha 's 
eyes," she said. 

" Yes, she has," Miss Milray assented, noting the 
upward slant of the child 's eyes, which gave his quaint- 
ness to her beauty. " He had fascinating eyes." 

After a moment Clementina asked, " Do you believe 
that the looks are all that ah left ? " 

Miss Milray reflected. " I know what you mean. 
I should say character was left, and personality 
somewhere." 

" I used to feel as if it we e left here, at fust as 
if he must come back. But that had to go." 

" Yes." 

" Everything seems to go. After a while even the 
loss of him seemed to go." 

" Yes, losses go with the rest." 

" That 's what I mean by its seeming as if it never 
any of it happened. Some things before it are a great 
deal more real." 

" Little things ? " 

" Not exactly. But things when I was very young." 
Miss Milray did not know quite what she intended, 
but she knew that Clementina was feeling her way to 
something she wanted to say, and she let her alone. 
" When it was all over, and I knew that as long as I 
lived he would be somewhere else, I tried to be paht 
of the wo ld I was left in. Do you think that was 
right?" 

" It was wise ; and, yes, it was best" said Miss 
Milray, and for relief from the tension which was 



 

beginning to tell upon her own nerves, she asked, " I 
suppose you know about my poor brother ? I'd bet 
ter tell you to keep you from asking for Mrs. Milray, 
though I don 't know that it 's so very painful with 
him. There isn 't any Mrs. Milray now," she added, 
and she explained why. 

Neither of them cared for Mrs. Milray, and they 
did not pretend to be concerned about her, but Clem 
entina said, vaguely, as if in recognition of Mrs. Mil- 
ray 's latest experiment, " Do you believe in second 
marriages ? " 

Miss Milray laughed, " Well, not that kind exactly." 

" No," Clementina assented, and she colored a little. 

Miss Milray was moved to add, " But if you mean 
another kind, I don 't see why not. My own mother 
was married twice." 

" Was she ? " Clementina looked relieved and en 
couraged, but she did not say any more at once. Then 
she asked, " Do you know what ever became of Mr. 
Belsky ? " 

" Yes. He 's taken his title again, and gone back 
to live in Russia ; he 's made peace with the Czar, I 
believe." 

" That 's nice," said Clementina ; and Miss Milray 
made bold to ask : 

" And what has become of Mr. Gregory ? " 

Clementina answered, as Miss Milray thought, ten 
tatively and obliquely : " You know his wife died." 

" No, I never knew that she lived." 

" Yes. They went out to China, and she died 
the a." 



 

" And is lie there yet? But of course ! He could 
never have given up being a missionary." 

" Well," said Clementina, " he isn 't in China. His 
health gave out, and he had to come home. He 's in 
Middlemount Ccnta." 

Miss Milray suppressed the " Oh ! " that all but 
broke from her lips. " Preaching to the heathen, 
there ? " she temporized. 

" To the summa folks," Clementina explained, inno 
cent of satire. " They have got a Union Chapel the a, 
now, and Mr. Gregory has been preaching all summa." 
There seemed nothing more that Miss Milray could 
prompt her to say, but it was not quite with surprise 
that she heard Clementina continue, as if it were part 
of the explanation, and followed from the fact she had 
stated, " He wants me to marry him." 

Miss Milray tried to emulate her calm in asking, 
" And shall you ? " 

"I don 't know. I told him I would see; he only 
asked me last ni^ht. It would be kind of natural. He 

O 

was the fust. You may think it is strange " 

Miss Milray, in the superstition of her old-maiden 
hood concerning love, really thought it cold-blooded 
and shocking; but she said, "Oh, no." 

Clementina resumed : " And he says that if it was 
right for me to stop caring for him when I did, it is 
right now for me to ca e for him again, where the e 's 
no one to be hu t by it. Do you think it is ? " 

" Yes ; why not ? " Miss Milray was forced to the 
admission against what she believed the finer feelings 
of her nature. 



 

Clementina sighed, " I suppose he 's right. I always 
thought he was good. Women don 't seem to belong 
very much to themselves in this wo ld, do they ? " 

" No, they seem to belong to the men, either be 
cause they want the men, or the men want them ; it 
comes to the same thing. I suppose you don 't wish 
me to advise you, my dear ? " 

" No. I presume it 's something I 've  got to think 
out for myself." 

"But I think he 's good, too. I ought to say that 
much, for I didn 't always stand his friend with you. If 
Mr. Gregory has any fault it 's being too scrupulous." 

" You mean, about that old trouble our not be 
lieving just the same ? " Miss Milray meant some 
thing much more temperamental than that, but she 
allowed Clementina to limit her meaning, and Clem 
entina went on. " He 's changed all round now. He 
thinks it 's all in the life. He says that in China they 
couldn 't understand what he believed, but they could 
what he lived. And he knows I neva could be very 
religious." 

It was in Miss Milray 's heart to protest, " Clemen 
tina, I think you are one of the most religious persons 
I ever knew," but she forebore, because the praise 
seemed to her an invasion of Clementina 's dignity. 
She merely said, " Well, I am glad he is one of those 
who grow more liberal as they grow older. That is a 
good sign for your happiness. But I dare say it 's 
more of his happiness you think." 

" Oh, I should like to be happy, too. There would 
be no sense in it if I wasn t." 



 

" No, certainly not." 

"Miss Milray," said Clementina, with a kind of 
abruptness, " do you eva hear anything from Dr. 
Welwright ?" 

"No! Why?" Miss Milray fastened her gaze 
vividly upon her. 

" Oh, nothing. He wanted me to promise him, 
there in Venice, too." 

" I didn 't know it." 

" Yes. But I couldn t, then. And now he 's 
written to me. He wants me to let him come ova, 
and see me." 

" And and will you ? " asked Miss Milray, rather 
breathlessly. 

" I don 't know. I don 't know as I'd ought. I 
should like to see him, so as to be puffectly su a. But 
if I let him come, and then didn 't It wouldn 't be 
right ! I always felt as if I'd ought to have seen then 
that he ca ed for me, and stopped him ; but I didn t. 
No, I didn t," she repeated, nervously. " I respected 
him, and I liked him; but I neva " She stopped, 
and then she asked, " What do you think I'd ought 
to do, Miss Milray ? " 

Miss Milray hesitated. She was thinking super 
ficially that she had never heard Clementina say had 
ought, so much, if ever before. Interiorly she was 
recurring to a sense of something like all this before, 
and to the feeling which she had then that Clementina 
was really cold-blooded and self-seeking. But she 
remembered that in her former decision, Clementina 
had finally acted from her heart and her conscience, 



 

and she rose from her suspicion with a rebound. She 
dismissed as unworthy of Clementina any theory 
which did not account for an ideal of scrupulous and 
unselfish justice in her. 

* That is something that nobody can say but your 
self, Clementina," she answered, gravely. 

" Yes," sighed Clementina, " I presume that is so." 

She rose, and took her little girl from Miss Milray 's 
knee. "Say good-bye," she bade, looking tenderly 
down at her. 

Miss Milray expected the child to put up her lips 
to be kissed. But she let go her mother 's hand, took 
her tiny skirts between her finger-tips, and dropped a 
curtsey. 

" You little witch ! " cried Miss Milray. " I want 
a hug," and she crushed her to her breast, while the 
child twisted her face round and anxiously questioned 
her mother 's for her approval. " Tell her it 's all right, 
Clementina ! " cried Miss Milray. " When she 's as 
old as you were in Florence, I 'm going to make you 
give her to me." 

" Ah you going back to Florence ? " asked Clem 
entina, provisionally. 

" Oh, no ! You can 't go back to anything. That 's 
what makes New York so impossible. I think we 
shall go to Los Angeles." 



XL. 

ON her way home Clementina met a man walking 
swiftly forward. A sort of impassioned abstraction 
expressed itself in his gait and bearing. They had 
both entered the shadow of the deep pine woods that 
flanked the way on either side, and the fallen needles 
helped with the velvety summer dust of the roadway 
to hush their steps from each other. She saw him 
far off, but he was not aware of her till she was quite 
near him. 

" Oh ! " he said, with a start. " You filled my mind 
so full that I couldn 't have believed you were any 
where outside of it. I was coming to get you I was 
coming to get my answer." 

Gregory had grown distinctly older. Sickness and 
hardship had left traces in his wasted face, but the 
full beard he wore helped to give him an undue look 
of age. 

" I don 't know," said Clementina, slowly, " as I 've  
got an answa for you, Mr. Gregory yet." 

" No answer is better that the one I am afraid of ! " 

" Oh, I 'm not so sure of that," she said, with gentle 



 

perplexity, as slie stood, holding the hand of her little 
girl, who stared shyly at the intense face of the man 
before her. 

" I am," he retorted. " I have been thinking it all 
over, Clementina. I 've  tried not to think selfishly 
about it, but I can 't pretend that my wish isn 't selfish. 
It is ! I want you for myself, and because I 've  always 
wanted you, and not for any other reason. I never 
cared for any one but you in the way I cared for you, 
and " 

" Oh ! " she grieved. " I never ca ed at all for you 
after I saw him" 

" I know it must be shocking to you ; I haven 't told 
you with any wretched hope that it would commend 
me to you ! " 

" I don 't say it was so very bad," said Clementina, 
reflectively, " if it was something you couldn 't help." 

" It was something I couldn 't help. Perhaps I 
didn 't try." 

"Did she know it?" 

" She knew it from the first ; I told her before we 
were married." 

Clementina drew back a little, insensibly pulling her 
child with her. " I don 't believe I exactly like it." 

" I knew you wouldn 't ! If I could have thought 
you would, I hope I shouldn 't have wished and 
feared so much to tell you." 

" Oh, I know you always wanted to do what you 
believed was right, Mr. Gregory," she answered. 
" But I haven 't quite thought it out yet. You 
mustn 't hurry me." 


" No, no ! Heaven forbid." He stood aside to let 
her pass. 

" I was just going home," she added. 

" May I go with you ? " 

" Yes, if you want to. I don 't know but you bet- 
ta ; we might as well ; I want to talk with you. Don 't 
you think it 's something we ought to talk about sen 
sibly ? " 

"Why, of course! And I shall try to be guided 
by you ; I should always submit to be ruled by you, 
if" 

"That 's not what I mean, exactly. I, don 't want 
to do the ruling. You don 't undastand me." 

" I 'm afraid I don t," he assented, humbly. 

" If you did, you wouldn 't say that so." He did 
not venture to make any answer, and they walked on 
without speaking, till she asked, " Did you know that 
Miss Milray was at the Middlcmount ? " 

" Miss Milray ! Of Florence ? " 

" With her brother. I didn 't see him ; Mrs. Mil- 
ray is not he a ; they ah divo ced. Miss Milray used 
to be very nice to me in Florence. She isn 't going 
back there any moa. She says you can 't go back to 
anything. Do you think we can ? " 

She had left moments between her incoherent sen 
tences where he might interrupt her if he would, but 
he waited for her question. " I hoped we might ; but 
perhaps " 

" No, no. We couldn t. We couldn 't go back to 
that night when you threw the slippas into the riva, 
no to that time in Florence when we gave up, no to 



 

that day in Venice when I had to tell you that I ca ed 
moa for some one else. Don 't you see ? " 

" Yes, I see," he said, in quick revulsion from the 
hope he had expressed. " The past is full of the pain 
and shame of my errors ! " 

" I don 't want to go back to what 's past, eitha," 
she reasoned, without gainsaying him. 

She stopped again, as if that were all, and he asked, 
" Then is that my answer ? " 

" I don 't believe that even in the otha wo ld we 
shall want to go back to the past, much, do you ? " 
she pursued, thoughtfully. 

Once Gregory would have answered confidently ; he 
even now checked an impulse to do so. " I don 't 
know," he owned, meekly. 

" I do like you, Mr. Gregory ! " she relented, as if 
touched by his meekness, to the confession. " You 
know I do moa than I ever expected to like any 
body again. But it 's not because I used to like you, 
or because I think you always acted nicely. I think 
it was cruel of you, if you ca ed for me, to let me be 
lieve you didn t, afta that fust time. I can 't eva think 
it wasn t, no matta why you did it." 

" It was atrocious. I can see that now." 

" I say it, because I shouldn 't eva wish to say it 
again. I know that all the time you we e betta than 
what you did, and I blame myself a good deal moa 
fo not knowing when you came to Florence that I 
had begun to ca e for some one else. But I did wait 
till I could see you again, so as to be su a which I 
ca ed for the most. I tried to be fai a, before I told 



 

you that I wanted to be free. That is all," she said, 
gently, and Gregory perceived that the word was left 
definitely to him. 

He could not take it till he had disciplined himself 
to accept unmurmuringly his sentence as he under 
stood it. " At any rate," he began, " I can thank 
you for rating my motive above my conduct." 

" Oh," she said. " I don 't think either of us acted 
very well. I didn 't know till aftawa ds that I was 
glad to have you give up, the way you did in Flor 
ence. I was bewild ed. But I ought to have known, 
and I want you to undastand everything, now. I 
dorft ca e for you because I used to when I was almost 
a child, and I shouldn 't want you to ca e for me eitha, 
because you did then. That 's why I wish you had 
neva felt that you had always ca ed for me." 

" Yes," said Gregory. He let fall his head in des 
pair. 

" That is what I mean," said Clementina. " If we 
ah going to begin togetha, now, it 's got to be as if 
we had neva begun before. And you mustn 't think, 
or say, or look as if the e had been anything in oua 
lives but ouaselves. Will you ? Do you promise ? " 
She stopped, and put her hand on his breast, and 
pushed against it with a nervous vehemence. 

" No ! " he said. " I don 't promise, for I couldn 't 
keep my promise. What you ask is impossible. The 
past is part of us ; it can 't be ignored any more than 
it can be destroyed. If we take each other, it must 
be for all that we have been as well as all that we are. 
If we haven 't the courage for that we must part." 



 

He dropped the little one 's hand which he had been 
holding, and moved a few steps aside. " Don 't ! " 
she said. "They 'll think I 've  made you," and he 
took the child 's hand again. 

They had emerged from the shadow of the woods, 
and come in sight of her father 's house. Claxon was 
standing coatless before the door in full enjoyment of 
the late afternoon air ; his wife beside him, at sight of 
Gregory, quelled a natural impulse to run round the 
corner of the house from the presence of strangers. 
. " I wonda what they a say in ," she fretted. 

" It looks some as if she was say in yes," said 
Claxon, with an impersonal enjoyment of his conject 
ure. " I guess she saw he was bound not to take no 
for an answa." 

" I don 't know as I should like it very much," his
