Thyrsis was dumb with dismay. He stared from one 
of these people to another, and his heart went down 
down. He saw that his case was hopeless. He had no 
one to help him or to advise him, and he had less than 
eleven dollars in his pocket. 

"What do you propose to do?" he asked, weakly. 

"I have already telegraphed to Richard Haberton," 
said Jones. "He will meet us and see the next two per- 
formances ; and then we'll lay the company off until 
we get some kind of a practical play." 

And so the steam-roller rolled and the matter was 
settled ; and Thyrsis, broken-hearted, bid the trio fare- 
well, and took an early train back to New York. 

He never saw any member of the company again 
and he never saw the "practical play" which Mr. 
Richard Haberton made out of "The Genius". What 
was done he gathered from the press-clippings that 
came to him the famous author of "The Rajah's 
Diamond" caused Helena to fall into Lloyd's arms at 
the end of the second act, and had them safely if not 
happily married at the beginning of the third. Also 
he wrote several "charming" scenes for Ethelynda 
Lewis, and two weeks later the play had a second open- 
ing in another manufacturing town of New England 
where the critics, awed by the name of the distinguished 
dramatist upon the play-bills, were moved to faint 
praise. But perhaps it was that Mr. Richard Haber- 
ton required more than two weeks' time for the evolving 
of real "charm" ; at any rate the audience came in no 
larger numbers to see this new version, and the misbe- 
gotten production lived for another six performances, 



 

and died a peaceful death at the very gates of the 
metropolis. 

And such was the end of Thyrsis' career as a play- 
wright. In return for all his labors and his agonies 
he received some weeks later a note from Robertson 
Jones, Inc., to the effect that the books of "The 
Genius" showed a total deficit of six thousand seven 
hundred and forty-two dollars and seventeen cents ; and 
accordingly, under the contract, there was nothing due 
to the author. 



BOOK XI 
THE TORTURE-HOUSE 



They sat in the darkness, watching where the star- 
light gleamed upon the water. 

"We had always hoped' she was saying. "How end- 
lessly we hoped!" 

"Could we do it now?" he asked; and after a pause, 
he quoted from the poem 

"Unbreachable the fort 
Of the long-battered world uplifts its wall; 

And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows, 
And near and real the charm of thy repose, 
And night as welcome as a friend would fall!" 



1. THYRSIS came home beaten and crushed, worn 
out with overwork and worry, his heart black with rage 
and bitterness and despair. He met Corydon in the 
park, and she listened to his story, white and terrified. 
She had swallowed all her disappointment, had stayed 
at home with the baby while he went with the play ; and 
now the outcome of it all was this ! 

"What are you going to do?" she whispered; and he 
answered, "I don't know. I don't know." 

She saw the terrible state he was in, and she dared 
not utter a single word of her own grief. She bit her 
lip, and choked back her tears. "This is my life," she 
thought to herself ; "I must endure, endure that is 
all !" 

He could not afford even to sit and talk with her 
very long; there was no time to indulge in the luxury 
of despair. His money was gone, and he was in debt 
for some that he had borrowed. Since irregular eat- 
ing had been telling upon him again, he had been get- 
ting his meals with an acquaintance of the family, who 
kept a boarding-house uptown. On the strength of his 
prospects, she had trusted him for four dollars a week ; 
and now the play had failed, and he had to go and 
tell her, and listen to new protests as to his folly in 
refusing to "get a position". But in the end she bade 
him stay on ; and so he was divided between his shame, 
and the need of something to eat day by day. 

Time dragged on, and still there was no gleam of 
light. There were shameful hours in these weeks 





 

he touched the lowest point yet in his life. This was a 
typical cheap boarding-house, a place where the drudges 
of trade were herded ; it. was a home of sordidness and 
ugliness to Thyrsis its people seemed like carefully- 
selected types of all things that he hated in the world. 
There was a young broker's clerk, whose patter was of 
prices, and of fortunes made without service. There 
was a grey-haired bookkeeper for a giant "trust", a 
man who could not have had more pride in that great 
engine of exploitation, or more contempt for its vic- 
tims, had he been the president and chief owner thereof. 
There was a young divinity-student, who made greedy 
reaches for the cake-plate, and who summed up for 
Thyrsis all the cant and commonness of the church. 
There was a dry-goods clerk, who wore flaring ties, and 
who played the role of a "masher" upon the avenue 
every evening. And finally there was a red-faced Irish- 
man who wore large shiny cuffs and a false diamond, 
and who held some political job, and was voluble in be- 
half of "the organization". 

Among these people Thyrsis sat three times a day, 
silent and tortured, paying a high price for each morsel 
of food he ate. But also he was lonely, and craving 
any sort of respite ; and in the course of time he be- 
came acquainted with several of the younger men. One 
of the diversions in their pitiful and narrow lives was 
to gather in some room and indulge in petty gambling; 
sitting for hours upon hours with their faculties alert 
upon the attempt to get from each other some small 
fraction of that weekly stipend which kept them alive. 
Sometimes they played "penny-ante", and sometimes 
vingt et un; once, as it chanced, they needed another 
player, and they urged Thyrsis to join them. 

And so, for the first time in his life, Thyrsis learned 





what it meant to lay his soul upon the lap of the god- 
dess of chance. From eight o'clock that evening until 
two the next morning, he sat in a suffocating room full 
of cigarette-smoke, trying in vain to win back the dol- 
lar or two he had lost at the outset ; flushed and trem- 
bling with excitement, and hating himself with a bitter 
and tormenting hatred. And so he discovered his vice ; 
he discovered that he had in him the soul of the gambler ! 
And all the rest of the winter he had to wrestle with 
that shame. He would go to his dinner, tired and 
heartsick ; and they would ask him to play again ; and 
he the man who carried a message for humanity in his 
heart he would yield ! Three times during that win- 
ter he fell into the mire ; on Washington's birthday he 
began to play in the morning, and stopping only for 
meals, he played until long after midnight. Forever 
afterwards he was a humbler and a gentler man be- 
cause of that experience; understanding how squalor 
abases one, and how swiftly and stealthily an evil pas- 
sion closes its grasp about the soul. 

2. OF this shameful thing he said not a word to 
Corydon. But he avoided meeting her, because of the 
depths of his despair. And so at last there came a 
letter from her a long and unusual one. Corydon, 
too, was having her troubles, it appeared. 

"I am writing in haste," she said ; "I shall mail the 
letter at once, before my resolution fails me. At least 
a dozen times I have made up my mind to tell you or 
to write you what is here, and each time I have turned 
back. But now I have got to a stage where I must have 
your help. 

"I enclose a long letter which I wrote you years ago, 
before we were married. I was looking over some old 



 

papers the other day and came upon it. Generally 
when I wrote you letters that I did not send, I tore 
them up ; but something led me to keep this one I had 
a feeling that some day it would be interesting as a 
curiosity. You see, I am always persuading myself that 
I can get over this trouble, and learn to laugh at it ; 
and I am always succeeding but only to have it crop 
up in some different form. I have told you a little of 
it now and then but stop and read the enclosed, and 
you will see." 

So Thyrsis read the old letter a missive of anguish 
and terror, and beginning with elaborate preludings 
and hesitations : 

"I implore you to be patient with me this once ; and 
when I have gotten through, I want you still to love 
me, if possible. I have been trying to get the courage 
to write you something that is so mean and low, childish 
and almost imbecile, that there have been moments in 
which my horror of it was absolutely unspeakable ; 
when I have imagined myself as a soul damned, 
when I thought that if you knew, you would think I 
had a diseased brain. I only ask you to read patiently 
what I am going to write ; but know that every word is 
a horrible effort, that it is torture and humiliation to 
me to write it. I have a feeling now as though I were 
psychologically dissecting something. 

"It must have been eight years ago, when I was sick 
in bed; in a fever or delirium I conceived the idea that 
there was a coffin under my bed. The thought took 
hold of me, somehow, like an octopus, and I used to 
writhe under it, and get into fearful perspirations. I 
never went near a bed that I didn't think of this thing 
with the same horror. 





"And so I seemed to have created a nervousness, a 
sense of dread, before which I was absolutely helpless. 
I cannot tell you how hopelessly or fearfully I suffered, 
or what depths of despondency and despair and black- 
ness I was cast into. I cannot understand how a 
creature could so manufacture torments for itself. But 
this is not all, just for once have mercy and yet even 
now I am laughing at myself! 

"The winter I was sixteen I was much disappointed 
that I could not go to college, and almost the whole 
winter, when I was not diverted, I would brood over this 
habit. As I grew older, it would come to me in spasms, 
and it seemed to my dawning sense so monstrously child- 
like, so insane, that I was aghast that it had power to 
affect me. I can find no words to tell you of the un- 
speakable horror with which I saw, in my older days, 
that a thought could so torment me ; the mere fact of 
its being able to torment I could never forget. I know 
it was silly, unreasonable ; and yet every time it came 
to me I would be plunged into a hopelessness and* melan- 
choly, than which I can honestly conceive nothing more 
fearful upon earth. 

"Well, I continued to pursue myself with this mor- 
bidity (I would almost, rather kill myself than write 
this). As I got older my terror was less, but my 
melancholy greater, until I would be only half con- 
scious of what I was allowing myself to do. I seemed 
to have engendered within myself a hob-goblin. Once 
it was only last winter I saw a nasty word written 
on a fence, and it sent a shudder through me, for I 
knew it would follow me and. make me think of other 
things like it. I felt, since thoughts have such power 
to terrorize me, how can I ever get away from them? 

"Oh, how I have struggled tried to say it was not 



 

true that I was just as sane as other people! And 
this made my thirst for beauty all the more maddening, 
and my melancholy all the more complete! So I have 
lived, at intervale, and words cannot describe the hell 
that I have endured, the more horrible because it 
seemed to me so unreasonable, so insane. It occurred 
to me more or less this summer, though in a milder 
form ; but it often frightened me more than ever, as I 
felt how beautiful you were, and what you would think 
of me, if you knew I was capable of being the prey of 
such thoughts. So they were always more dreadful to 
me. 

"Can you possibly understand how the thought of a 
word could make me shudder? The mere idea of my be- 
ing capable of thinking of anything that was not 
beautiful ! When I longed to be only the embodiment of 
beauty and sometimes I am beautiful ! I look into 
the glass, and I seem to have something in my face that 
is a promise of a glory to come a light, a something, 
I love to imagine it. And then, that a thought 
should knock me prone, and make me cringe from the 
mere fact of its lowness and meanness ! 

"For the last two or three days I have again vic- 
timized myself ; and when I was not studying I was ask- 
ing myself in anguish what was the matter with me, 
and if there was no hope for me on earth. I dodged 
around and tried to laugh it off, then I went to the 
piano and lost myself in the dissatisfaction of my play- 
ing ; but when I stopped, I was conscious of a great 
depression, as though I were chained in a dungeon. I 
jumped up, and said I could stand it no longer. I 
will tell Thyrsis, I said ; but no, I will die first ! I 
added. He could not tolerate me afterwards, he would 
think me only fit for the insane-asylum. Oh, why 





should I be so cursed? And then, somehow, I imagined 
that I told you, and that you laughed at me, that you 
pitied me and that you held out your hand, and said, 
'Come, you shall find beauty poor, deluded, wretched, 
little creature !' I really imagined that this had hap- 
pened, and I was relieved as with a draught of fresh 
air. 

"Oh, God in Heaven, to think that I could ever have 
been so degraded! My head hurts, and I absolutely 
am dazed, to think that I have been able to write you of 
something for which (though it has not been my mak- 
ing) I am so ashamed and humiliated I can hardly hold 
my head up. I think in my short life I have atoned for 
the sins of many souls." 

3. SUCH was the old-time letter. "And now," 
wrote Corydon, "I don't want you to think that if I did 
not send you this, it was because I was afraid to do 
it, or unwilling to trust to your love. It was simply 
because I felt that I could conquer these things that 
it would be weak and contemptible of me not to do so. 
Nor is the -reason I write you now that I have not been 
able to conquer them, that I am still at the mercy of 
such habits. I am a grown woman, and I am not afraid 
of words ; I tell myself this a hundred times ; and it is 
true and yet there is a way in which it is not true. 
The thing is so intricate I never get to the end of it; 
I rid myself of the fear of a hateful idea, but there 
remains the fact that I should have been afraid; there 
is the fear of fear. And then comes a flood of shame 
that I should have it in me to be afraid of fear ! 

"Thyrsis, as I write to you now I see clearly how 
perfectly preposterous and unreal all this is ; and again 
there comes to me the impulse to tear up this letter, 



 

and banish the troop of hob-goblins from my mind. 
But no, this time I am determined to make a clean breast 
of the thing for I see that secrecy and solitude are 
what it feeds on. If I were happy and busy with you, 
such ideas would have no power over me. But think 
how it is, with my loneliness and despair ! I don't want 
to say anything to make your task harder but oh, 
Thyrsis, it is frightful to have nothing to do but wait, 
and wait, and wait ! The baby wakes me up in the 
night and I lie for hours it is at such times that these 
phantoms take hold of me. Do you realize that I liter- 
ally never know what it is to have more than three or 
four consecutive hours of sleep? 

"No, I am not insane, I tell myself ; I am not insane ! 
It is the circumstances of my life that cause this melan- 
cholia and misery. It has been my life, from the very 
beginning for what a hopeful and joyous creature I 
would have been, had I only had a chance as a girl! 
I know that ; and you must tell it to me, and help me 
to believe it." 

Thyrsis read this with less surprise than Corydon 
had imagined ; for she had been wont to drop hints 
about her trouble from time to time. He was shocked, 
however, to find what a hold it had taken upon her ; 
the thing sent a chill of fear to his heart. Could it be 
after all that she had some taint? But he saw at once 
that he must not let her see any such feeling; the least 
hint of it would have driven her to distraction. On 
the contrary, he must minimize the trouble, must help 
her to laugh it away, as she asked. 

He went to meet her in the park, and found her in 
an agony of distress ; she had mailed the letter, and 
then she had wished to recall it, and had been struggling 





ever since with the idea that he would be disgusted with 
her. Now, when she found that such was not the case, 
that he still loved her and trusted her, she was trans- 
ported with gratitude. 

"But dearest," he said, "how absurd it is to be 
ashamed of an idea ! If ugly things exist, don't we have 
to hear of them and know of them? And so why 
frighten ourselves because they are in our minds ?" 

"But Thyrsis," cried she, "they are so hateful!" 

"Yes," he said. "But then the more you hate them, 
the more they haunt you !" 

"That's just it !" she exclaimed. 

"But what harm can they do? Can they have any 
effect upon your character? You must say to yourself 
that all this is a consequence of the structure of your 
brain-cells. What could be more futile than trying to 
forget? As if the very essence of the trying was not 
remembering!" 

So Thyrsis went on to argue with her. He made her 
promise him that in future she would tell him of all 
her obsessions, permitting no fear or shame to deter 
her ; and so thereafter he would have to listen periodi- 
cally to long accounts of her psychological agonies, 
and help her to hunt out the "hob-goblins" from the 
tangled thickets of her mind. They were forever set- 
tling the matter, positively and finally but alas, only 
to have something uniettle it again. So Thyrsis had 
to add to his other accomplishments the equipment of 
a psycho-pathologist ; he brushed up his French, and 
read learned treatises upon the researches in the Sal- 
petriere, and the theories of the "Nancy School". 

4. ANOTHER month passed by, and still there was 
no rift in the clouds. Once more Corydon was for- 



 

bidden to see him, and so her pain grew day by day. 
At last there came another letter, voicing utter despera- 
tion. Something must be done, she declared, she was 
slowly going out of her mind. Thyrsis could have no 
idea of the shamefulness of her position, the humilia- 
tions she had to face. "I tell you the thing is putting 
a brand upon my soul," she wrote. "It is something 
I shall never get over all my life. It is withering me 
up it is destroying my self-respect, my very decency ; 
it is depriving me of my power to act, or even to think. 
People come in, relatives or friends even strangers to 
me and peer at me and pry into my affairs ; I hear 
them whispering in the parlor 'Hasn't he got a posi- 
tion yet?' or 'How can she have anything to do with 
him?' The servants gossip about me the woman I 
have for a nurse despises me and insults me, and I have 
not the courage to rebuke her. To-day I went almost 
wild with fury I rushed into the bathroom and locked 
the door and flung myself upon the floor. I found my- 
self gnawing at the rug in my rage I mean that 
literally. That is what life has left for me ! 

"I tell you you must take me away, we must get out 
of this fiendish city. Let us go into the wilderness as 
you said, and live as we can I would rather starve to 
death than face these things. Let us get into the 
country, Thyrsis. You can work as a farm-hand, and 
earn a few dollars a week surely that could not be a 
greater strain upon us than the way things are now." 

When Thyrsis received this, he racked his brains 
once more ; and then he sat down and wrote a letter to 
Barry Creston. He told how he had worked over the 
play, and how it had gone to ruin ; he told of his 
present plight. He knew, he said, that Mr. Creston 
had been interested in the play, and that he was a man 





who understood the needs of the artist-life. Would he 
lend two hundred dollars, which would suffice until 
Thyrsis could get another work completed? 

He waited a week for a reply to this ; and when it 
arrived he opened it with trembling fingers. He half 
expected a check to fall fluttering to the floor ; but alas, 
there was not a single flutter. "I have read your let- 
ter," wrote the young prince, "and I have considered 
the matter carefully. I would do what you ask, were 
it not for my conviction that it would not be a good 
thing for you. It seems to me the testimony of all ex- 
perience, that artists do their great work under the 
spur of necessity. I do not believe that real art can 
ever be subsidized. It is for men that you are writing ; 
and you must find out how to make men hear you. You 
may not thank me for this now, but some day you will, 
I believe." 

After duly pondering which communication, Thyrsis 
racked his wits, and bethought him of yet another per- 
son to try. He sat himself down and addressed Mr. 
Robertson Jones. He explained that he was in this cruel 
plight, owing to his having devoted so many months to 
"The Genius." Even the actors had received something 
for the performances of the play they had given ; but 
the author had received nothing at all. He asked Mr. 
Jones for a personal loan to help him in a great emer- 
gency ; and he promised to repay it at the earliest pos- 
sible moment. To which Mr. Jones made this reply 
"Inasmuch as the failure of the play was due solely to 
your own obstinacy, it seems to me that your present 
experiences are affording exactly the discipline you 
need." 

5. HOWEVER, there are many ups and downs in 



 

the trade of free-lance writer. The very day after he 
had received this letter, there came, in quick succession, 
two bursts of sunlight through the clouds of Thyrsis' 
despair. The first was a letter, written in a quaint 
script, from a man who explained that he was interested 
in a "Free People's Theatre" in one of the cities of 
Germany. "You will please to accept my congratula- 
tions," he wrote ; "I had never known such a play as 
yours in America to be written. I should greatly be 
pleased to translate the play, so that it might be known 
in Germany. Our compensation would have to be little, 
as you will understand ; but of appreciation I think you 
may receive much in the Fatherland." 

To which Thyrsis sent a cordial response, saying that 
he would be glad of any remuneration, and enclosing a 
copy of the manuscript of "The Genius". And then 
only two days later came the other event, a still more 
notable one ; a letter from the publisher who had been 
number thirty-seven on the list of "The Hearer of 
Truth". Thyrsis had got so discouraged about this 
work that he now sent it about as a matter of routine, 
and without thinking of it at all. Great, therefore, was 
his amazement when he opened the letter and read that 
this publisher was disposed to undertake it, and would 
be glad to see him and talk over terms. 

Thyrsis went, speculating on the way as to what 
strange manner of being this publisher might be. The 
solution of the mystery he found was that the publisher 
was new at the business, and had entrusted his "literary 
department" to a very young man who had enthusiasms. 
The young man held his position for only a month or 
two; but in that month or two Thyrsis got in his 
"innings". 

The publisher wished to bring the book out that 





spring. He offered a ten per cent, royalty, and the 
trembling author summoned the courage to ask for one 
hundred dollars advance ; when he got it, he was divided 
between his delight, and a sneaking regret that he had 
not tried for a hundred and fifty! 

The very next day came the contracts and the money ; 
Thyrsis marvelled at the fact that there were people 
who could sign checks for a hundred dollars, and 
apparently not mind it in the least. With the 
money he was able to pay all his debts, and also a bill 
which Corydon had received from a "specialist" who 
had been treating her. This was a new habit that Cory- 
don was developing, as a result of headaches and back- 
aches and other obscure miseries. These amiable "spe- 
cialists" permitted one to run up a bill with them ; and 
so, whenever Thyrsis made a new "strike", there were 
always debts to eat up the greater part of it. 

They had now another hope to lure them ; new proofs 
to read, and in due time, new reviews. But it would be 
fall before they could expect more money from the book, 
and meantime there was still the problem of the sum- 
mer. So, as usual, Thyrsis was plotting and planning, 
groping about him and trying one desperate scheme 
after another ; his head was like a busy workshop, from 
which came every hour new plans, new expedients, new 
experiments. And meanwhile, of course, deep down in 
his soul there was forming the new work, that some day 
would emerge and take possession of him, driving every- 
thing else from his consciousness. 

People would repeat to him, over and over, their 
dreary formula "Get a position! Get a position!" 
And patiently, unwearyingly, Thyrsis would set himself 
to explain to them what it was like to be inspired. It 
was not perversity upon his part, it was not conceit ; it 



 

was no more these than it was laziness. It was some- 
thing that was in him something that he had not put 
there himself, something that he could not take out of 
himself; a thing that took possession of him, without any 
intention upon his part, without any permission ; a thing 
that required him to do certain acts, and that tore him 
to pieces if he did not do them. And how should he be 
blamed because he could not do as other men because 
he could not take care of himself, nor even of his wife 
and child? Because he could not have any rights, be- 
cause he could not possess the luxuries of manhood 
and self-respect? Because, in short, he was cast out 
into the gutter for every dog to snarl at and for every 
loafer to spurn? Could it be that in this whole civili- 
zation, with its wealth and power, its culture and learn- 
ing, its sciences and arts and religions there was not 
to be found one single man or woman who could recog- 
nize such a state of affairs, and realize what it meant? 

6. ABOUT this time Thyrsis thought of another 
plan. Perhaps he might get some one to publish the 
play in book form that would bring him a little money, 
and possibly also it might help him to interest some 
other manager or actor. So he took the manuscript 
to his friend Mr. Ardsley, who told him it would not 
sell, and then gave him another lecture upon his folly 
in not having written the "practical" novel; and then 
he took it to the publisher for whom Prof. Osborne 
acted as reader. So he had another conference with 
that representative of authority. 

"I'll get him some day," Thyrsis had said to him- 
self, after their last interview; and he found that he 
had almost "got" him now. There was no chance of 
the play's selling, said the professor, and therefore 





no recommending it for publication ; but it was indeed 
a remarkable piece of work one might possibly say 
that it was a great piece of work. 

To which the author responded, "Why can't one 
say that surely?" 

"I'm not quite sure," said the other, "whether your 
violinist is a genius, or only thinks he is." 

Thyrsis pondered this. "That's rather an important 
question," he said. 

"Yes," admitted the other. 

"There ought to be some way of deciding such a 
question definitely." 

"Yes, there ought to be." 

"But there isn't?" 

"No I'm afraid there isn't. We know too little 
about genius as yet." 

"But, professor," said Thyrsis, "you are a critic 
you write books of criticism. And that's the one ques- 
tion a critic has to answer." 

"Yes, I know," said Prof. Osborne. 

"And yet, when you face the issue, you give up." 

"It has generally taken a long time to decide such a 
matter," was the professor's reply. 

"Yes, it has," said the other; "and meantime the 
man is starved out." 

There was a pause. "You have never had any such 
experience yourself?" asked Thyrsis. "Of inspiration, 
I mean."
