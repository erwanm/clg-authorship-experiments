their ideas than the similar class of any other 
people ; but this prodigality is partially bal 
anced by the parsimony of words in some 
higher regions, in which a few phrases of cur 
rent slang are made to do the whole duty of 
exchange of ideas ; if that can be called exchange 
of ideas when one intellect flashes forth to an 
other the remark, concerning some report, that 
" you know how it is yourself," and is met by 
the response of " that 's what 's the matter," and 
rejoins with the perfectly conclusive "that 's so." 
It requires a high degree of culture to use slang 



 



with elegance and effect ; and we are yet very far 
from the Greek attainment. 



IV. 

THE fireplace wants to be all aglow, the wind 
rising, the night heavy and black above, but 
light with sifting snow on the earth, a back 
ground of inclemency for the illumined room 
with its pictured walls, tables heaped with books, 
capacious easy-chairs and their occupants, it 
needs, I say, to glow and throw its rays far 
through the crystal of the broad windows, in 
order that we may rightly appreciate the relation 
of the wide-jambed chimney to domestic architect 
ure in our climate. We fell to talking about it ; 
and, as is usual when the conversation is profess 
edly on one subject, we wandered all around it. 
The young lady staying with us was roasting 
chestnuts in the ashes, and the frequent explo 
sions required considerable attention. The mis 
tress, too, sat somewhat alert, ready to rise at any 
instant and minister to the fancied want of this 
or that guest, forgetting the reposeful truth that 



 

people about a fireside will not have any wants 
if they are not suggested. The worst of them, 
if they desire anything, only want something hot, 
and that later in the evening. And it is an open 
question whether you ought to associate with 
people who want that. 

I was saying that nothing had been so slow in 
its progress in the world as domestic architecture. 
Temples, palaces, bridges, aqueducts, cathedrals, 
towers of marvellous delicacy and strength, grew to 
perfection while the common people lived in hovels, 
and the richest lodged in the most gloomy and con 
tracted quarters. The dwelling-house is a modern 
institution. It is a curious fact that it has only 
improved with the social elevation of women. 
Men were never more brilliant in arms and letters 
than in the age of Elizabeth, and yet they had no 
homes. They made themselves thick-walled cas 
tles, with slits in the masonry for windows, for 
defence, and magnificent banquet-halls for pleas 
ure ; the stone rooms into which they crawled 
for the night were often little better than dog- 
kennels. The Pompeians had no comfortable 
night-quarters. The most singular thing to me, 



 

however, is that, especially interested as woman 
is in the house, she has never done anything for 
architecture. And yet woman is reputed to be 
an ingenious creature. 

HERBERT. I doubt if woman has real inge 
nuity ; she has great adaptability. I don't say 
that she will do the same thing twice alike, like a 
Chinaman, but she is most cunning in suiting 
herself to circumstances. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. O, if you speak of con 
structive, creative ingenuity, perhaps not ; but 
in the higher ranges of achievement that of 
accomplishing any purpose dear to her heart, 
for instance her ingenuity is simply incompre 
hensible to me. 

HERBERT. Yes, if you mean doing things by 
indirection. 

THE MISTRESS. When you men assume all 
the direction, what else is left to us ? 

THE FIRE-TENDER. Did you ever see a wo 
man refurnish a house ? 

THE YOUNG LADY STAYING WITH Us. I never 
saw a man do it, unless he was burned out of his 
rookery. 



HERBERT. There is no comfort in new things. 

THE FIRE-TENDER (not noticing the inter 
ruption). Having set her mind on a total revo 
lution of the house, she buys one new thing, not 
too obtrusive, nor much out of harmony with the 
old. The husband scarcely notices it, least of all 
does he suspect the revolution, which she already 
has accomplished. Next, some article that does 
look a little shabby beside the new piece of 
furniture is sent to the garret, and its place is 
supplied by something that will match in color 
and effect. Even the man can see that it ought 
to match, and so the process goes on, it may be 
for years, it may be forever, until nothing of the 
old is left, and the house is transformed as it was 
predetermined in the woman's mind. I doubt if 
the man ever understands how or when it was 
done ; his wife certainly never says anything 
about .the refurnishing, but quietly goes on to 
new conquests. 

THE MISTRESS. And isn't it better to buy 
little by little, enjoying every new object as you 
get it, and assimilating each article to your 
household life, and making the home a har- 



 

monious expression of your own taste, rather 
than to order things in sets, and turn your 
house, for the time being, into a furniture ware- 
room ? 

THE FIRE-TENDER. O, I only spoke of the 
ingenuity of it. 

THE YOUNG LADY. For my part, I never can 
get acquainted with more than one piece of fur 
niture at a time. 

HERBERT. I suppose women are our superiors 
in artistic taste, and I fancy that I can tell 
whether a house is furnished by a woman or a 
man ; of course, I mean the few houses that ap 
pear to be the result of individual taste and refine 
ment, most of them look as if they had been 
furnished on contract by the upholsterer. 

THE MISTRESS. Woman's province in this 
world is putting things to rights. 

HERBERT. With a vengeance, sometimes. In 
the study, for example. My chief objection to 
woman is that she has no respect for the news 
paper, or the printed page, as such. She is Siva, 
the destroyer. I have noticed that a great part 
of a married man's time at home is spent in try- 



 

ing to find the things he has put on his study- 
table. 

THE YOUNG LADY. Herbert speaks with the 
bitterness of a bachelor shut out of paradise. It 
is my experience that if women did not destroy 
the rubbish that men bring into the house, it 
would become uninhabitable, and need to be 
burned down every five years. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. I confess women do a 
great deal for the appearance of things. When 
the mistress is absent, this room, although every 
thing is here as it was before, does not look at all 
like the same place ; it is stiff, and seems to lack 
a soul. When she returns, I can see that her 
eye, even while greeting me, takes in the situa 
tion at a glance. While she is talking of the 
journey, and before she has removed her travelling- 
hat, she turns this chair and moves that, sets one 
piece of furniture at a different angle, rapidly, 
and apparently unconsciously, shifts a dozen 
little knick-knacks and bits of color, and the room 
is transformed. I couldn't do it in a week. 

THE MISTRESS. That is the first time I ever 
knew a man admit he couldn't do anything if he 
had time. 



 

HERBERT. Yet with all her peculiar instinct 
for making a home, women make themselves 
very little felt in our domestic architecture. 

THE MISTRESS. Men build most of the houses 
in what might be called the ready-made-clothing 
style, and we have to do the best we can with 
them ; and hard enough it is to make cheerful 
homes in most of them. You will see something 
different when the woman is constantly consulted 
in the plan of the house. 

HERBERT. We might see more difference if 
women would give any attention to architecture. 
Why are there no women architects? 

THE FIRE-TENDER. Want of the ballot, doubt 
less. It seems to me that here is a splendid 
opportunity for woman to come to the front. 

THE YOUNG LADY. They have no desire to 
come to the front ; they would rather manage 
things where they are. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. If they would master the 
noble art, and put their brooding taste upon it, 
we might very likely compass something in our 
domestic architecture that we have not yet at 
tained. The outside of our houses needs atten- 



 

tion as well as the inside. Most of them are as 
ugly as money can build. 

THE YOUNG LADY. What vexes me most is, 
that women, married women, have so easily con 
sented to give up open fires in their houses. 

HERBERT. They dislike the dust and the 
bother. I think that women rather like the 
confined furnace heat. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. Nonsense; it is their an 
gelic virtue of submission. We wouldn't be hired 
to stay all day in the houses we build. 

THE YOUNG LADY. That has a very chival 
rous sound, but I know there will be no reforma 
tion until women rebel and demand everywhere 
the open fire. 

HERBERT. They are just now rebelling about 
something else ; it seems to me yours is a sort 
of counter-movement, a fire in the rear. 

THE MISTRESS. I 'll join that movement. The 
time has come when woman must strike for her 
altars and her fires. 

HERBERT. Hear, hear! 

THE MISTRESS. Thank you, Herbert. I ap 
plauded you once, when you declaimed that 



years ago in the old Academy. I remember 
how eloquently you did it. 

HERBERT. Yes, I was once a spouting idiot. 

Just then the door-bell rang, and company 
came in. And the company brought in a new 
atmosphere, as company always does, some 
thing of the disturbance of out-doors, and a good 
deal of its health)'- cheer. The direct news that 
the thermometer was approaching zero, with a 
hopeful prospect of going below it, increased to 
liveliness our satisfaction in the fire. When the 
cider was heated in the brown stone pitcher, 
there was difference of opinion whether there 
should be toast in it ; some were for toast, 
because that was the old-fashioned way, and 
others were against it, "because it does not taste 
good" in cider. Herbert said there was very 
little respect left for our forefathers. 

More wood was put on, and the flame danced 
in a hundred fantastic shapes. The snow had 
ceased to fall, and the moonlight lay in silvery 
patches among the trees in the ravine. The con 
versation became worldly. 




;ERBERT said, as we sat by the fire 
? one night, that he wished he had 
I turned his attention to writing poe- 
"' try like Tennyson's. 
The remark was not whimsical, but satirical. 
Tennyson is a man of talent, who happened to 
strike a lucky vein, which he has worked with 
cleverness. The adventurer with a pick-axe in 
Washoe may happen upon like good fortune. 
The world is full of poetry as the earth is of 
"pay-dirt"; one only needs to know how to 
" strike " it. An able man can make himself 
almost anything that he will. It is melancholy 
to think how many epic poets have been lost 
in the tea-trade, how many dramatists (though 



 

the age of the drama has passed), have wasted 
their genius in great mercantile and mechanical 
enterprises. I know a man who might have 
been the poet, the essayist, perhaps the critic, of 
this country, who chose to become a county 
judge, to sit day after day upon a bench in an 
obscure corner of the world, listening to wrang 
ling lawyers and prevaricating witnesses, prefer 
ring to judge his fellow-men rather than enlighten 
them. 

It is fortunate for the vanity of the living and 
the reputation of the dead, that men get almost 
as much credit for what they do not as for what 
they do. It was the opinion of many that Burns 
might have excelled as a statesman, or have been 
a great captain in war ; and Mr. Carlyle says 
that if he had been sent to a university, and 
become a trained intellectual workman, it lay in 
him to have changed the whole course of British 
literature ! A large undertaking, as so vigorous 
and dazzling a writer as Mr. Carlyle must know 
by this time, since British literature has swept 
by him in a resistless and widening flood, mainly 
uncontaminated, and leaving his grotesque con- 





trivances wrecked on the shore with other curios 
ities of letters, and yet among the richest of all 
the treasures lying there. 

It is a temptation to a temperate man to 
become a sot, to hear what talent, what versa 
tility, what genius, is almost always attributed to 
a moderately bright man who is habitually drunk. 
Such a mechanic, such a mathematician, such a 
poet he would be if he were only sober ; and then 
he is sure to be the most generous, magnani 
mous, friendly soul, conscientiously honorable, if 
he were not so conscientiously drunk. I sup 
pose it is now notorious that the most brilliant 
and promising men have been lost to the world 
in this way. It is sometimes almost painful to 
think what a surplus of talent and genius there 
would be in the world if the habit of intoxication 
should suddenly cease ; and what a slim chance 
there would be for the plodding people who have 
always had tolerably good habits. The fear is 
only mitigated by the observation that the repu 
tation of a person for great talent sometimes 
ceases with his reformation. 

It is believed by some*that the maidens who 



 

would make the best wives never marry, but 
remain free to bless the world with their im 
partial sweetness, and make it generally habit 
able. This is one of the mysteries of Providence 
and New England life. It seems a pity, at first 
sight, that all those who become poor wives have 
the matrimonial chance, and that they are de 
prived of the reputation of those who would be 
good wives were they not set apart for the high 
and perpetual office of priestesses of society. 
There is no beauty like that which was spoiled 
by an accident, no accomplishments and graces 
are so to be envied as those that circumstances 
rudely hindered the development of. All of 
which shows what a charitable and good-tem 
pered world it is, notwithstanding its reputa 
tion for cynicism and detraction. 

Nothing is more beautiful than the belief of 
the faithful wife that her husband has all the 
talents, and could, if he would, be distinguished 
in any walk in life ; and nothing will be more 
beautiful unless this is a very dry time for 
signs than the husband's belief that his wife 
is capable of taking charge of any of the affairs 



 

of this confused planet. There is no woman but 
thinks that her husband, the green-grocer, could 
write poetry if he had given his mind to it, or 
else she thinks small beer of poetry in com 
parison with an occupation or accomplishment 
purely vegetable. It is touching to see the look 
of pride with which the wife turns to her husband 
from any more brilliant personal presence or dis 
play of wit than his, in the perfect confidence 
that if the world knew what she knows there 
would be one more popular idol. How she mag 
nifies his small wit, and dotes upon the self-satis 
fied look in his face as if it were a sign of wis 
dom ! What a councillor that man would make ! 
What a warrior he would be ! There are a great 
many corporals in their retired homes who did 
more for the safety and success of our armies 
in critical moments, in the late war, than any 
of the " high-cock-a-lorum " commanders. Mrs. 
Corporal does not envy the reputation of General 
Sheridan ; she knows very well who really won 
Five Forks, for she has heard the story a hun 
dred times, and will hear it a hundred times 
more with apparently unabated interest. What 



 

a general her husband would have made ; and 
how his talking talent would shine in Congress ! 

HERBERT. Nonsense. There isn't a wife in 
the world who has not taken the exact measure of 
her husband, weighed him and settled him in her 
own mind, and knows him as well as if she had 
ordered him after designs and specifications of 
her own. That knowledge, however, she ordina 
rily keeps to herself, and she enters into a league 
with her husband, which he was never admitted 
to the secret of, to impose upon the world. In 
nine out of ten cases he more than half believes 
that he is what his wife tells him he is. At any 
rate she manages him as easily as the keeper does 
the elephant, with only a bamboo wand and a 
sharp spike in the end. Usually she flatters him, 
but she has the means of pricking clear through 
his hide on occasion. It is the great secret of 
her power to have him think that she thoroughly 
believes in him. 

THE YOUNG LADY STAYING WITH Us. And 
you call this hypocrisy ? I have heard authors, 
who thought themselves sly observers of women, 
call it so. 



 







HERBERT. Nothing of the sort. It is the basis 
on which society rests, the conventional agree 
ment. If society is about to be overturned, it is 
on this point. Women are beginning to tell men 
what they really think of them ; and to insist 
that the same relations of downright sincerity 
and independence that exist between men shall 
exist between women and men. Absolute truth 
between souls, without regard to sex, has always 
been the ideal life of the poets. 

THE MISTRESS. Yes ; but there was never a 
poet yet who would bear to have his wife say 
exactly what she thought of his poetry, any more 
than he would keep his temper if his wife beat 
him at chess ; and there is nothing that disgusts 
a man like getting beaten at chess by a woman. 

HERBERT. Well, women know how to win by 
losing. I think that the reason why most women 
do not want to take the ballot and stand out in 
the open for a free trial of power, is that they are 
reluctant to change the certain domination of 
centuries, with weapons they are perfectly com 
petent to handle, for an experiment. I think we 
should be better off if women were more trans- 



 

parent, and men were not so systematically puffed 
up by the subtle flattery which is used to control 
them. 

MANDEVILLE. Deliver me from transparency. 
When a woman takes that guise, and begins to 
convince me that I can see through her like a ray 
of light, I must run or be lost. Transparent wo 
men are the truly dangerous. There was one on 
ship-board [Mandeville likes to say that ; he has 
just returned from a little tour in Europe, and he 
quite often begins his remarks with " on the ship 
going over " ; the Young Lady declares that he 
has a sort of roll in his chair, when he says it, 
that makes her sea-sick] who was the most inno 
cent, artless, guileless, natural bunch of lace and 
feathers you ever saw ; she was all candor and 
helplessness and dependence ; she sang like a 
nightingale, and talked like a nun. There never 
was such simplicity. There wasn't a sounding- 
line on board that would have gone to the 
bottom of her soulful eyes. But she managed the 
captain and all the officers, and controlled the 
ship as if she had been the helm. All the pas 
sengers were waiting on her, fetching this and 



 

that for her comfort, inquiring of her health, talk 
ing about her genuineness, and exhibiting as 
much anxiety to get her ashore in safety, as if 
she had been about to knight them all and give 
them a castle apiece when they came to land. 

THE MISTRESS. What harm ? It shows what 
I have always said, that the service of a noble 
woman is the most ennobling influence for men. 

MANDEVILLE. If she is noble, and not a mere 
manager. I watched this woman to see if she 
would ever do anything for any one else. She 
never did. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. Did you ever see her 
again ? I presume ' Mandeville has introduced 
her here for some purpose. 

MANDEVILLE. No purpose. But we did see 
her on the Rhine ; she was the most disgusted 
traveller, and seemed to be in very ill humor with 
her maid. I judged that her happiness depended 
upon establishing controlling relations with all 
about her. On this Rhine boat, to be sure, there 
was reason for disgust. And that reminds me of 
a remark that was made. 

THE YOUNG LADY. Oh! 



MANDEVILLE. When we got aboard at May- 
ence we were conscious of a dreadful odor some 
where ; as it was a foggy morning, we could see 
no cause of it, but concluded it was from some 
thing on the wharf. The fog lifted, and we got 
under way, but the odor travelled with us, and 
increased. We went to every part of the vessel 
to avoid it, but in vain. It occasionally reached 
us in great waves of disagreeableness. We had 
heard of the odors of the towns on the Rhine, 
but we had no idea that the entire stream was 
infected. It was intolerable. 

The day was lovely, and the passengers stood 
about on deck holding their noses and admir 
ing the scenery. You might see a row of them 
leaning over the side, gazing up at some old 
ruin or ivied crag, entranced with the romance 
of the situation, and all holding their noses with 
thumb and finger. The sweet Rhine ! By and 
by somebody discovered that the odor came from 
a pile of cheese on the forward deck, covered 
with a canvas ; it seemed that the Rhinelanders 
are so fond of it that they take it with them 
when they travel. If there should ever be war 



 

between us and Germany, the borders of the 
Rhine would need no other defence from Ameri 
can soldiers than a barricade of this cheese. I 
went to the stern of the steamboat to tell a stout 
American traveller what was the origin of the 
odor he had been trying to dodge all the morn 
ing. He looked more disgusted than before 
when he heard that it was cheese ; but his only 
reply was : " It must be a merciful God who can 
forgive a smell like that ! " 



II. 

THE above is introduced here in order to illus 
trate the usual effect of an anecdote on conversa 
tion. Commonly it kills it. That talk must be 
very well in hand, and under great headway, that 
an anecdote thrown in front of will not pitch off 
the track and wreck. And it makes little differ 
ence what the anecdote is ; a poor one depresses 
the spirits, and casts a gloom over the company ; 
a good one begets others, and the talkers go to 
telling stories; which is very good entertainment 
in moderation, but is not to be mistaken for that 



 

unwearying flow of argument, quaint remark, 
humorous color, and sprightly interchange of 
sentiments and opinions, called conversation. 

The reader will perceive that all hope is gone 
here of deciding whether Herbert could have 
written Tennyson's poems, or whether Tennyson 
could have dug as much money out of the Helio- 
gabulas Lode as Herbert did. The more one 
sees of life, I think the impression deepens that 
men, after all, play about the parts assigned 
them, according to their mental and moral gifts, 
which are limited and preordained, and that their 
entrances and exits are governed by a law no less 
certain because it is hidden. Perhaps nobody 
ever accomplishes all that he feels lies in him to 
do ; but nearly every one who tries his powers 
touches the walls of his being occasionally, and 
learns about how far to attempt to spring. There 
are no impossibilities to youth and inexperience ; 
but when a person has tried several times to 
reach high C and been coughed down, he is quite 
content to go down among the chorus. It is 
only the fools who keep straining at high C all 
their lives. 



 



Mandeville here began to say that that reminded him of something that happened when 
he was on the 

But Herbert cut in with the observation 
that no matter what a man's single and several 
capacities and talents might be, he is controlled 
by his own mysterious individuality, which is 
what metaphysicians call the substance, all else 
being the mere accidents of the man. And this 
is the reason that we cannot with any certainty 
tell what any person will do or amount to, for, 
while we know his talents and abilities, we do not 
know the resulting whole, which is he himself. 

THE FIRE-TENDER. So if you could take all 
the first-class qualities that we admire in men 
and women, and put them together into one 
being, you wouldn't be sure of the result ? 

HERBERT. Certainly not. You would proba 
bly have a monster. It takes a cook of long 
experience, with the best materials, to make a 
dish " taste good " ; and the " taste good " is the 
indefinable essence, the resulting balance or 
harmony which makes man or woman agreeable 
or beautiful or effective in the world.
