"much more than I kept yours. I should be 
without a head to-day if you hadn't seen so to 
my future, just as I should be without a heart, 
you must really let me remark, if I didn't look 
now to your past. I consider that to know that 
fact in it takes me of itself well-nigh far enough 
in appreciation of you for my curiosity, even at 
its most exasperated, to rest on a bed of roses. 
However, my imagination itself," Gray still more 
beautifully went on, "insists on making additions 

231, 



 

— since how can't it, for that matter, picture again 
the rate at which it made them then ? I hadn't 
even at the time waited for you to save my life 
in order to think you a swell. If I thought you 
the biggest kind of one, and if in your presence 
now I see just as much as ever why I did, what 
does that amount to but that my mind isn't a 
blank about you ?" 

"Well, if mine had ever been one about you," 
said Horton, once more facing it, "our so inter- 
esting conversation here would have sufficed to 
cram it full. The least I can make of you, 
whether for your protection or my profit, is just 
that you're insanely romantic." 

"Romantic — yes," Gray smiled; "but oh, but 
oh, so systematically!" 

"It's your system that's exactly your madness. 
How can you take me, without a stroke of suc- 
cess, without a single fact of performance, to my 
credit, for anything but an abject failure ? You're 
in possession of no faintest sign, kindly note, that 
I'm not a mere impudent ass." 

Gray accepted this reminder, for all he showed 
to the contrary, in the admiring spirit in which 
he might have regarded a splendid somersault or 
an elegant trick with cards; indulging, that is, 
by his appearance, in the forward bend of atten- 
tion to it, but then falling back to more serious 
ground. "It's my romance that's itself my rea- 
son; by which I mean that I'm never so reason- 





 

able, so deliberate, so lucid and so capable- J -to 
call myself capable at any hour! — as when I'm 
most romantic. I'm methodically and consist- 
ently so, and nothing could make and keep me, 
for any dealings with me, I hold, more conve- 
niently safe and quiet. You see that you can 
lead me about by a string if you'll only tie it to 
my appropriate finger — which you'll find out, if 
you don't mind the trouble, by experience of the 
wrong ones, those where the attachment won't 
'act.'" He drew breath to give his friend the 
benefit of this illustration, but another connection 
quickly caught him up. "How can you pretend 
to suggest that you're in these parts the faintest 
approach to an insignificant person? How can 
you pretend that you're not as clever as you can 
stick together, and with the cleverness of the 
right kind ? For there are odious kinds, I know 
— the kind that redresses other people's stupidity 
instead of sitting upon it." 

"I'll answer you those questions," Horton 
goodhumouredly said, "as soon as you tell me 
how you've come by your wonderful ground for 
them. Till you're able to do that I shall resent 
your torrent of abuse. The appalling creature 
you appear to wish to depict !" 

"Well, you're simply a figure — what I call — 
in all the force of the term; one has only to look 
at you to see it, and I shall give up drawing con- 
clusions from it only when I give up looking. 





 

You can make out that there's nothing in a preju- 
dice," Gray developed, "for a prejudice may be, 
or must be, so to speak, single-handed; but you 
can't not count with a relation — I mean one 
you're a party to, because a relation is exactly 
a fact of reciprocity. Our reciprocity, which 
exists and which makes me a party to it by 
existing for my benefit, just as it makes you 
one by existing for yours, can't possibly result 
in your not 'figuring' to me, don't you see? with 
the most admirable intensity. And I simply de- 
cline," our young man wound up, "not to believe 
tremendous things of any subject of a relation of 
mine." 

"'Any' subject?" Vinty echoed in a tone that 
showed how intelligently he had followed. "That 
condition, Fm afraid," he smiled, "will cut down 
not a little your general possibilities of relation." 
And then as if this were cheap talk, but a point 
none the less remained: "In this country one's a 
figure (whatever you may mean by that !) on easy 
terms; and if I correspond to your idea of the 
phenomenon you'll have much to do — I won't 
say for my simple self, but for the comfort of your 
mind — to make your fond imagination fit the 
funny facts. You pronounce me an awful swell 
— which, like everything else over here, has less 
weight of sense in it for the saying than it could 
have anywhere else; but what barest evidence 
have you of any positive trust in me shown on 





 

any occasion or in any connection by one creature 
you can name?" 

"Trust?" — Gray looked at the red tip of the 
cigarette between his fingers. 

"Trust, trust, trust!" 

Well, it didn't take long to say. "What do 
you call it but trust that such people as the Brad- 
hams, and all the people here, as he tells me, 
receive you with open arms ?" 

"Such people as the Bradhams and as 'all the 
people here'!" — Horton beamed on him for the 
beauty of that. "Such authorities and such 
'figures,' such allegations, such perfections and 
such proofs! Oh," he said, "I'm going to have 
great larks with you !" 

"You give me then the evidence I want in 
the very act of challenging me for it. What bet- 
ter proof of your situation and your character 
than your possession exactly of such a field for 
whatever you like, of such a dish for serving me 
up ? Mr. Bradham, as you know," Gray con- 
tinued, "was this morning so good as to pay me 
a visit, and the form in which he put your glory 
to me — because we talked of you ever so pleas- 
antly — was that, by his appreciation, you know 
your way about the place better than all the rest 
of the knowing put together." 

Horton smiled, smoked, kept his hands in his 
pockets. "Dear deep old Davey !" 

"Yes," said Gray consistently, "isn't he a 




 

wise old specimen ? It's rather horrid for me 
having thus to mention, as if you had applied 
to me for a place, that I've picked up a good 
'character' of you, but since you insist on it he 
assured me that I couldn't possibly have a better 
friend." 

"Well, he's a most unscrupulous old person 
and ought really to be ashamed. What it comes 
to," Haughty added, "is that though I've re- 
peatedly stayed with them they've to the best 
of his belief never missed one 6£ the spoons. The 
fact is that even if they had poor Davey wouldn't 
know it." 

"He doesn't take care of the spoons?" Gray 
asked in a tone that made his friend at once swing 
round and away. He appeared to note an un- 
expectedness in this, yet, "out" as he was for 
unexpectedness, it could grow, on the whole, 
clearly, but to the raising of his spirits. "Well, 
I shall take care of my loose valuables and, un- 
warned by the Bradhams and likely to have such 
things to all appearance in greater number than 
ever before, what can I do but persist in my 
notion of asking you to keep with me, at your 
convenience, some proper count of them ? " After 
which as Horton's movement had carried him 
quite to the far end of the room, where the force 
of it even detained him a little, Gray had him 
again well in view for his return, and was prompted 
thereby to a larger form of pressure. "How can 





 

you pretend to palm off on me that women mustn't 
in prodigious numbers 'trust' you?" 

Haughty made of his shoulders the most pro- 
digious hunch. "What importance, under the 
sun, has the trust of women — in numbers how- 
ever prodigious ? It's never what's best in a man 
they trust — it's exactly what's worst, what's most 
irrelevant to anything or to any class but them- 
selves. Their kind of confidence," he further 
elucidated, "is concerned only with the effect of 
their own operations or with those to which they 
are subject; it has no light either for a man's 
other friends or for his enemies : it proves nothing 
about him but in that particular and wholly de- 
tached relation. So neither hate me nor like me, 
please, for anything any woman may tell you." 

Horton's hand had on this renewed and em- 
phasised its proposal of good-night; to which his 
host acceded with the remark: "What superfluous 
precautions you take!" 

"How can you call them superfluous," he asked 
in answer to this, "when you've been taking them 
at such a rate yourself? — in the interest, I mean, 
of trying to persuade me that you can't stand on 
your feet?" 

"It hasn't been to show you that I'm silly about 
life — which is what you've just been talking of. 
It has only been to show you that I'm silly about 
affairs," Gray said as they went at last through 
the big bedimmed hall to the house doors, which 





 

stood open to the warm summer night under the 
protection of the sufficient outward reaches. 

"Well, what are affairs but life?" Vinty, at 
the top of the steps, sought to know. 

"You'll make me feel, no doubt, how much 
they are — which would be very good for me. 
Only life isn't affairs — that's my subtle distinc- 
tion," Gray went on. 

"I'm not sure, I'm not sure!" said Horton 
while he looked at the stars. 

"Oh rot — / am!" Gray happily declared; to 
which he the next moment added: "What it 
makes you contend for, you see, is the fact of my 
silliness." 

"Well, what is that but the most splendid fact 
about you, you jolly old sage ?" — and his visitor, 
getting off, fairly sprang into the shade of the 
shrubberies. 







BOOK FOURTH 
I 

Again and again, during the fortnight that fol- 
lowed his uncle's death, were his present and his 
future to strike our young man as an extraordi- 
nary blank cheque signed by Mr. Betterman and 
which, from the moment he accepted it at all, he 
must fill out, according to his judgment, his cour- 
age and his faith, with figures, monstrous, fan- 
tastic, almost cabalistic, that it seemed to him 
he should never learn to believe in. It was not 
so much the wonder of there being in various New 
York institutions strange deposits of money, to 
amounts that, like familiar mountain masses, ap- 
peared to begin at the blue horizon and, sloping 
up and up toward him, grew bigger and bigger 
the nearer he or they got, till they fairly overhung 
him with their purple power to meet whatever 
drafts upon them he should make; it was not the 
tone, the climax of dryness, of that dryest of men 
Mr. Crick, whose answering remark as to any 
and every particular presumption of credit was 
"Well, I guess I've fixed it so as you'll find some- 
thing there"; that sort of thing was of course 
fairy-tale enough in itself, was all the while and in 





 

a hundred connections a sweet assault on his 
credulity, but was at the same time a phase of 
experience comparatively vulgar and that tended 
to lose its edge with repetition. The real, the 
overwhelming sense of his adventure was much 
less in the fact that he could lisp in dollars, as it 
were, and see the dollars come, than in those vast 
vague quantities, those spreading tracts, of his 
own consciousness itself on which his kinsman's 
prodigious perversity had imposed, as for his ex- 
ploration, the aspect of a boundless capital. This 
trust of the dead man in his having a nature that 
would show to advantage under a bigger strain 
than it had ever dreamed of meeting, and the 
corresponding desolate freedom on his own part 
to read back into the mystery such refinements 
either, or such crude candours, of meaning and 
motive as might seem best to fit it, that was the 
huge vague inscribable sum which ran up into 
the millions and for which the signature that let- 
tered itself to the last neatness wherever his mind's 
eye rested was "good" enough to reduce any 
more casual sign in the scheme of nature or of 
art to the state of a negligible blur. Mr. Crick's 
want of colour, as Gray qualified this gentleman's 
idiosyncrasy from the moment he saw how it 
would be their one point of contact, became, by 
the extreme rarity and clarity with which it 
couldn't but affect him, the very most gorgeous 
gem, of the ruby or topaz order, that the smooth 





 

forehead of the actual was for the present to 
flash upon him. 

For dry did it appear inevitable to take the fact 
of a person's turning up, from New York, with no 
other retinue than an attendant scribe in a straw 
hat, a few hours before his uncle's last one, and 
being beholden to mere Miss Mumby for simple 
introduction to Gray as Mr. Betterman's lawyer. 
So had such sparenesses and barenesses of form to 
register themselves for a mind beset with the 
tradition that consequences were always somehow 
voluminous things; and yet the dryness was of a 
sort, Gray soon apprehended, that he might take 
up in handfuls, as if it had been the very sand of 
the Sahara, and thereby find in it, at the least 
exposure to light, the collective shimmer of 
myriads of fine particles. It was with the sub- 
stance of the desert taken as monotonously spar- 
kling under any motion to dig in it that the abyss 
of Mr. Crick's functional efficiency was filled. 
That efficiency, in respect to the things to be done, 
would clearly so answer to any demand upon it 
within the compass of our young man's subtlety, 
that the result for him could only be a couple of 
days of inexpressible hesitation as to the outward 
air he himself should be best advised to aim at 
wearing. He reminded himself at this crisis of 
the proprietor of a garden, newly acquired, who 
might walk about with his gardener and try to 
combine, in presence of abounding plants and the 





 

vast range of luxuriant nature, an ascertainment 
of names and properties and processes with a dis- 
simulation, for decent appearance, of the positive 
side of his cockneyism. By no imagination of a 
state of mind so unfurnished would the gardener 
ever have been visited; such gaping seams in the 
garment of knowledge must affect him at the 
worst as mere proprietary languor, the offhand- 
ness of repletion; and no effective circumvention 
of traditional takings for granted could late-born 
curiosity therefore achieve. Gray's hesitation 
ceased only when he had decided that he needn't 
care, comparatively speaking, for what Mr. Crick 
might think of him. He was going to care for 
what others might — this at least he seemed rest- 
lessly to apprehend; he was going to care tremen- 
dously, he felt himself make out, for what Ro- 
sanna Gaw might, for what Horton Vint might — 
even, it struck him, for what Davey Bradham 
might. But in presence of Mr. Crick, who in- 
sisted on having no more personal identity than 
the omnibus conductor stopping before you but 
just long enough to bite into a piece of paste- 
board with a pair of small steel jaws, the ques- 
tion of his having a character either to keep or 
to lose declined all relevance — and for the reason 
in especial that whichever way it might turn for 
him would remain perhaps, so to speak, the most 
unexpressed thing that should ever have happened 
in the world. 





 

The effect producible by him on the persons 
just named, and extending possibly to whole 
groups of which these were members, would be 
an effect because somehow expressed and en- 
countered as expression: when had he in all his 
life, for example, so lived in the air of expression 
and so depended on the help of it, as in that so 
thrilling night-hour just spent with the mystify- 
ing and apparently mystified, yet also apparently 
attached and, with whatever else, attaching, 
Vinty ? It wasn't that Mr. Crick, whose analogue 
he had met on every occasion of his paying his 
fare in the public conveyances — where the per- 
sons to whom he paid it, without perhaps in their 
particulars resembling each other, all managed 
nevertheless to be felt as gathered into this ref- 
erence — wasn't in a high degree conversible; it 
was that the more he conversed the less Gray 
found out what he thought not only of Mr. Bet- 
terman's heir but of any other subject on which 
they touched. The gentleman who would, by 
Gray's imagination, have been acting for the 
executors of his uncle's will had not that precious 
document appeared to dispense with every super- 
fluity, could state a fact, under any rash invita- 
tion, and endow it, as a fact, with the greatest 
conceivable amplitude — this too moreover not 
because he was garrulous or gossiping, but be- 
cause those facts with which he was acquainted, 
the only ones on which you would have dreamed 





 

of appealing to him, seemed all perfect nests or 
bags of other facts, bristling or bulging thus with 
every intensity of the positive and leaving no 
room in their interstices for mere appreciation to 
so much as turn round. They were themselves 
appreciation — they became so by the simple 
force of their existing for Mr. Crick's arid men- 
tion, and they so covered the ground of his con- 
sciousness to the remotest edge that no breath 
of the air either of his own mind or of anyone's 
else could have pretended to circulate about them. 
Gray made the reflection — tending as he now felt 
himself to waste rather more than less time in 
this idle trick — that the different matters of con- 
tent in some misunderstandings have so glued 
themselves together that separation has quite 
broken down and one continuous block, sugges- 
tive of dimensional squareness, with mechanical 
perforations and other aids to use subsequently 
introduced, comes to represent the whole life of 
the subject. What it amounted to, he might 
have gathered, was that Mr. Crick was of such a 
common commonness as he had never up to now 
seen so efficiently embodied, so completely or- 
ganised, so securely and protectedly active, in 
a word — not to say so garnished and adorned 
with strange refinements of its own: he had 
somehow been used to thinking of the extreme 
of that quality as a note of defeated application, 
just as the extreme of rarity would have to be. 





 

His domestic companion of these days again and 
again struck him as most touching the point at 
issue, and that point alone, when most proclaim- 
ing at every pore that there wasn't a difference, 
in all the world, between one thing and another. 
The refusal of his whole person to figure as a 
fact invidiously distinguishable, that of his aspect 
to have an identity, of his eyes to have a con- 
sciousness, of his hair to have a colour, of his 
nose to have a form, of his mouth to have a mo- 
tion, of his voice to consent to any separation of 
sounds, made intercourse with him at once ex- 
tremely easy and extraordinarily empty; it was 
deprived of the flicker of anything by the way 
and resembled the act of moving forward in a 
perfectly-rolling carriage with the blind of each 
window neatly drawn down. 

Gray sometimes advanced to the edge of trying 
him, so to call it, as to the impression made on 
him by lack of recognitions assuredly without 
precedent in any experience, any, least of all, of 
the ways of beneficiaries; but under the necessity 
on each occasion of our young man's falling back 
from the vanity of supposing himself really pre- 
sentable or apprehensible. For a grasp of him 
on such ground to take place he should have had 
first to show himself and to catch his image some- 
how reflected; simply walking up and down and 
shedding bland gratitude didn't convey or ex- 
hibit or express him in this case, as he was sure 

2



 

these things had on the other hand truly done 
where everyone else, where his uncle and Ro- 
sanna, where Mr. Gaw and even Miss Mumby, 
where splendid Vinty, whom he so looked to, 
and awfully nice Davey Bradham, whom he so 
took to, were concerned. It all came back to 
the question of terms and to the perception, in 
varying degrees, on the part of these persons, of 
his own; for there were somehow none by which 
Mr. Crick was penetrable that would really tell 
anything about him, and he could wonder in free- 
dom if he wasn't then to know too that last im- 
munity from any tax on his fortune which would 
consist in his having never to wince. Against 
wincing in other relations than this one he was 
prepared, he only desired, to take his precautions 
— visionary precautions in those connections truly 
swarming upon him; but apparently he was 
during these first days of the mere grossness of 
his reality to learn something of the clear state 
of seeing every fond sacrifice to superstition that 
he could think of thrust back at him. If he could 
but have brought his visitor to say after twenty- 
four hours of him "Well, you're the damnedest 
little idiot I've ever had to pretend to hold com- 
merce with !" that would on the spot have pressed 
the spring of his rich sacrificial "Oh I must be, 
I must be! — how can I not abjectly and grate- 
fully be?" Something at least would so have 
been done to placate the jealous gods. But in- 





 

stead of that the grossness of his reality just 
flatly included this supremely useful friend's per- 
haps supposing him a vulgar voluptuary, or at 
least a mere gaping maw, cynically, which 
amounted to say frivolously, indifferent to every- 
thing but the general fact of his windfall. Strange 
that it should be impossible in any particular 
whatever to inform or to correct Mr. Crick, who 
sat unapproachable in the midst of the only 
knowledge that concerned him. 

He couldn't help feeling it conveyed in the 
very breath of the summer airs that played about 
him, to his fancy, in a spirit of frolic still lighter 
and quicker than they had breathed in other 
climes, he couldn't help almost seeing it as the 
spray of sea-nymphs, or hearing it as the sounded 
horn of tritons, emerging, to cast their spell, 
from the foam-flecked tides around, that he was 
regarded as a creature rather unnaturally "quiet" 
there on his averted verandahs and in his darkened 
halls, even at moments when quite immense 
things, by his own measure, were happening to 
him. Everything, simply, seemed to be happen- 
ing, and happening all at once — as he could say 
to himself, for instance, by the fact of such a 
mere matter as his pulling up at some turn of his 
now renewedly ceaseless pacing to take in he 
could scarce have said what huge though soft 
collective rumble, what thick though dispersed 
exhalation, of the equipped and appointed life, 





 

the life that phrased itself with sufficient as- 
surance as the multitudinous throb of Newport, 
borne toward him from vague regions, from be- 
hind and beyond his temporary blest barriers, 
and representing for the first time in his experience 
an appeal directed at him from a source not some- 
what shabbily single. An impression like that 
was in itself an event — so repeatedly in his other 
existence (it was already his quite unconnectedly 
other) had the rumour of the world, the voice of 
society, the harmonies of possession, been charged, 
for his sensibility, with reminders which, so far 
from suggesting association, positively waved 
him off from it. Mr. Betterman's funeral, for 
all the rigour of simplicity imposed on it by his 
preliminary care, had enacted itself in a pon- 
derous, numerous, in fact altogether swarming 
and resounding way; the old local cemetery on 
the seaward-looking hillside, as Gray seemed to 
identify it, had served for the final scene, and 
our young man's sense of the whole thing reached 
its finest point in an unanswered question as to 
whether the New York business world or the New 
York newspaper interest were the more copiously 
present. The business world broke upon him 
during the recent rites in large smooth tepid 
waves — he was conscious of a kind of generalised 
or, as they seemed to be calling it, standardised 
face, as of sharpness without edge, save when 
edge was unexpectedly improvised, bent upon 





 

him for a hint of what might have been better 
expressed could it but have been expressed hu- 
morously; while the newspaper interest only fed 
the more full, he felt even at the time, from the 
perfectly bare plate offered its flocking young 
emissaries by the most recognising eye at once 
and the most deprecating dumbness that he 
could command. 

He had asked Vinty, on the morrow of Vinty's 
evening visit, to "act" for him in so far as this 
might be; upon which Vinty had said gaily — he 
was unexceptionally gay now — "Do you mean 
as your best man at your marriage to the bride 
who is so little like St. Francis's ? much as you 
yourself strike me, you know, as resembling the 
man of Assisi." Vinty, at his great present ease, 
. constantly put things in such wonderful ways; 
which were nothing, however, to the way he 
mostly did them during the days he was able 
to spare before going off again to other calls, 
other performances in other places, braver and 
breezier places on the bolder northern coast, it 
mostly seemed: his allusions to which excited 
absolutely the more curious interest in his friend, 
by an odd law, in proportion as he sketched them, 
under pressure, as probably altogether alien to 
the friend's sympathies. That was to be for the 
time, by every indication, his amusing "line" — 
his taking so confident and insistent a view of 
what it must be in Gray's nature and tradition 





 

to like or not to like that, as our young man for 
that matter himself assured him, he couldn't 
have invented a more successfully insidious way 
of creating an appetite than by passing under a 
fellow's nose every sort of whiff of the indigestible.
