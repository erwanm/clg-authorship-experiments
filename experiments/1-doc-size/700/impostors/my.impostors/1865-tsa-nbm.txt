hearts beat to a lighter measure. No, dear, it was not 
misfortune that brought us here, but honest indepen 
dence. If the change works any social alienations, 
they will not hurt us ; for we dwell too much in the 
real things of life to be affected by any new adjustment 
of its unreal things. We look more to hearts than faces. 
To-day has brought me sweet compensation." 

Lena paused, looking tenderly into her friend's face 

" What, Lena ? " 

" Your return, darling." Tears sprang into her eyes. 

" My heart has always held you as a precious thing, 



 

Lydia. The old love has never grown dim cannot 
grow dim cannot die. If we have seemed to stand 
coldly apart, there has been no coldness with me. Cir 
cumstance, not interior change, has come between us. 
I always felt that this was so ; and now I know it. To 
get back an old friend, Lydia, is to gain more than I 
have lost." 

Touched deeply by this, the heart of Lydia gushed 
in tears from her eyes. She had come, trying in her 
weakness, to gather up strength to support Lena in the 
hour of darkness and trial ; but Lena was strong, and 
brave, and cheerful. The storm, which, in her fear, had 
brought desolation to the heart of an .old friend, had 
swept by without harm. The garden of her mind had 
not lost a green leaf, nor a fragrant blossom. Before 
this calm strength, her own spirit bowed in tearful 
weakness. Strong to comfort, a little while before, she 
was nerveless now. 

" And how is it with you, Lydia ? " asked Mrs. 
Hofland, as she looked more closely at her friend, 
whose pale, thin face, suggested bad health and a mind 
ill at ease. 

Tears filled the eyes of Lydia again : her lips quiver 
ed as she tried to answer. Then she hid her face 
against Lena, and struggled with the rising tide. A few 
strong sobs shook her wasted frame. 

" Dear friend!" murmured Lena, kissing her fore 
head, " God comforts ; God strengthens." 

But, thdre was no reply. 

"It was not good for us to have held apart from each 
other so long," murmured Lena. 



 

" Oh, no, no, it was not good. But it was my fault, 
not yours," answered Lydia, " and mine has been the 
loss. While you have grown strong in the life-battle, I 
have grown weaker weaker weaker. I thought 
you had suffered misfortune, and came to offer the love 
and sympathy that was in my heart ; but, I find you brave 
and cheerful. Earthly storms cannot shatter the fair 
temple your soul has builded earthly clouds cannot 
darken its windows, Lena ! With you is the beauty of 
life, with me its desolation ! " 

" No, no, my friend ; do not say that," replied Lena. 

" There is beauty for all peace for all." 

" Not for me," was sadly responded " not for me. 
I have lost my way in the world, and something tells 
me that I shall never find it again never." 

" Dear Lydia ! How strangely you talk. Do not let 
such thoughts haunt your soul. Tormenting spirits 
have gained access to your mind and afflict you with 
their dark suggestions. Look up to God, who is the 
comforter, the enlightener, the sustainer. He will make 
a plain way for you : He will strike rifts in the cloud ; 
He will bring you peace." 

" Not in this w r orld, Lena." Mrs. Guy raised her 
head, and turned a pale face, over which a strong calm 
had fallen, upon her friend.- " Not in this world, Le 
na." She repeated the sentence in a steady voice. 

" He will, He will ; but you must look up." 

" I cannot, Lena." 

" Oh, my friend, the promise is to every one. Come 
unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and 
I will give you rest. We cannot fall into any state 




of mind beyond God's reach and sympathy. He came 
down to man's lowest extremity. We cannot be in any 
suffering, or darkness, or temptation, through which He 
did not pass in the Incarnation, and out of which He 
cannot lift us. He knows our sorrows. He is acquaint 
ed with our grief for into his human consciousness 
He received all possible human suffering, and by subdu 
ing the evil from which it flowed, changed sorrow into 
joy, and grief into gladness." 

" It may be so, Lena ; but I have lost my way, and 
cannot find it again. You have one to lean upon I 
stand alone. You have a husband I am worse than 
widowed. Dear friend ! bear with me a little, and 
hear me speak as I never thought to speak in the ear of 
living mortal. Delicacy, honor^ right all, all, oppose 
my speech yet, only in utterance now, can my poor 
heart be saved from palsy. The sweetness of your life, 
as I see it now, has made me feel, more painfully, the 
bitterness of my own. Lena, my soul is imprisoned 
and starving ; and only death can give it release. 
Adam has shut the door and turned the key." 

" Oh, Lydia ! Do'nt talk so. I shall think your 
mind wandering." 

A strange gleam shot across Lydia's wan face a 
strange light flashed in her eyes. Mrs. Hofland felt 
a cold shudder run to her heart. The suggestion was 
unfortunate. 

" I should not wonder if it went wholly astray," said 
Mrs. Guy, mournfully. " Women have lost their rea 
son through lighter suffering than mine." 

" This is not well," answered Lena. " Let us be 



 

strong and brave let us endure and be patient. God's 
better time will come. Out of much tribulation the 
saints go upward, at last, white robed and rejoicing." 

But Lydia shook her head slowly and sadly, and 
drawing  a little away, said " If you will not hear me, 
well. I can keep silent though my heart break." 

Instantly Lena threw an arm around her friend. 
" Dear Lydia ! say on. Speak to me as if I were a sis 
ter nay ; nearer and dearer than a sister. I hold you 
in my heart. Your life is precious to me. It is not well 
with my friend ; there is darkness in her soul her 
feet are moving along uncertain ways. How is it ? 
Why has the night fallen so soon ? Why have her steps 
wandered ? " 

" I have no husband, Lena ! " The tones struck 
sharply on the ears of Mrs. Hofland. " There is a man, 
named Adam Guy who promised to be my husband ; a 
man to whose soul my soul sought to wed itself. But, 
he has turned from my love and bound himself to an 
other." 

" Lydia! " Mrs. Hofland was shocked. 

" It is even so, my friend. Human love has died out 
of him. Gold is his bride." 

Mrs. Guy was silent for a time, and then went on. 
" With Adam, money is the greatest good. Its love has 
crushed out all other loves. Husband, father, friend, 
in their true signification these are no more. Avarice has supplanted them. And I am a woman, Lena ; 
a woman, and bound to this man hopelessly bound. 
His wife, in law, and the mother of his children ; but 
of no account in his eyes in comparison with money. 



 

Can a woman bear this ? Can a woman's heart beat 
against a heart of gold, and not be hurt at every pulsa 
tion ? I tell you no, Lena no no no ! There 
may be those of our sex who, thus conditioned, would 
compensate or revenge themselves by license, or undying 
contention ; but these are not true women. A true 
woman must love ; rob her of this necessity of her na 
ture, and you darken her whole life, as mine is dark 
ened." 

" Dear friend ! " said Mrs. Hofland, drawing an arm 
tightly around Lydia, " you have children. There is 
mother-love as well as wife-love." 

" Children ! Yes, I have children ! " The tones 
of Mrs. Guy's voice gave Lena another shock. 

" Children ! " she continued, bitterly " Have not 
the lion's whelps the lion's tooth ? Yes, I have chil 
dren ; or, more truly speaking, a cage of young wild 
beasts, perpetually struggling against each other, in 
whom the animal nature grows stronger every day. I 
grow weaker and weaker, in contention. A little while 
and they will devour me." 

" Lydia, this is dreadful ! You are talkino- wildly. 


It cannot be so." Mrs. Hofland pushed her friend 
away, and looked anxiously into her face. She feared 
the glare of insanity. But, though the eyes of Lydia 
were tearless and fixed, they gave back intelligent 
glances. 

" I am talking in sober earnest, Lena. It is even as 
I have said. My children, as they grow older, grow 
more and more away from my influence. Adam, who 
is like his father in everything, sets himself against me 



 

so resolutely, that I am often powerless in my efforts to 
move him. If his father is present, an appeal against 
my authority is generally conclusive. The boy is both 
avaricious and cruel, and I see these evils gainino- 
strength daily. All that I can do, is like beating the 
wind. John is forever in contention with Adam, and 
they are growing to hate each other. Lydia throws 
herself in mad antagonism against her brothers, and 
takes more pleasure in strife than anything else. She 
does not seem to have any moral sense whatever any 
conscience any reverence. And my three younger 
children are like the elder. I do not wish to live until 
they become grown up men and women ; for they will 
either tear each other like uncaged beasts, or part in un 
dying hate. Oh, to be the mother of such a brood ! 
Would that I had died a baby in my mother's arms ! " 

Pent up feelings overflowed their boundaries, and 
Mrs. Guy fell upon her friend, and wept violently, for a 
long time. 

" Forgive me, Lena," she said, on regaining calmness, 
" for having intruded things which should have been 
sacred to myself. I never thought to have spoken thus 
to any living soul ; but, there are times of weakness, 
when utterance becomes a necessity. Ah, Lena, if I 
could have talked to you of what was in my heart, 
years ago, it might have been better. The burden of 
unexpressed anguish has been too great for me. I am 
conscious of daily decreasing strength. Mind and body 
are fast giving way. I feel weak and bewildered near 
ly all the time. The elements with which I have to 
contend, are too strong for me." 



 

" God is strong. Lay your burden on him, Lydia." 

" I have turned from Him, and He has turned from 
me," answered Mrs. Guy, in a hopeless kind of utter 
ance. 

"Nay, nay, my dear friend ! God is an ever pres 
ent help to all who look to him." 

" That may be so, Lena ; but we do not look to Him. 
Ours is a Godless house. No praying ; no Bible read 
ing ; no church going. We are heathen." 

" I do not wonder that you are in darkness and be 
wilderment, Lydia," said Mrs. Hofland, soberly and 
impressively, " I do not wonder that your children are 
growing up in strife. I do not wonder that your eyes 
look fearfully down the future. If there is no regard 
for religion in your house ; no storing of precious truths 
from the Bible in the minds of your children ; no lift 
ing of hearts upward in prayer to God, the case is bad 
indeed. You must try to change all this." 

But Mrs. Guy shook her head, murmuring, in a weak 
way "I cannot." 

" Don't say that, Lydia. You can, if you will. If 
the older children are, as intimated, beyond your influ 
ence, begin with the little ones. Save them." 

At this moment Mrs. Hofland's two oldest children 
entered the room, quietly, an arm of each around the 
other's waist. 

"Who are these? Not your Lena and Frank?" 
said Mrs. Guy, reaching her hands to the children, who 
came to her side in a respectful way, and looked pleasant 
ly into her face. 

" Lena and Frank,'' replied Mrs. Hofland, as a bright 



 

smile lit up her countenance. " This is Mrs. Guy, 
don't you remember her ? " And she spoke to the chil 
dren. 

Lena said yes, and Frank stood silent, with his looks 
modestly cast down. Mrs. Guy kissed them, tears fill 
ing her eyes as she thought how rudely and boldly her 
oldest children would have dashed into the room, had 
she been at home, and Mrs. Hofland the visitor. 

Their entrance having interrupted the conversation, 
when resumed, it kept away from the unhappy subject 
in which it had dwelt from the beginning, and reached 
a more cheerful elevation. 

" You will come to see me, Lena ? "said Mrs. Guy, 
as she held tightly the hand of Mrs. Hofland, at parting. 

Oh yes." 

" Come soon." 

" Yes, very soon." 

" Remember me to your good husband. I wish 
he were, as once, Adam's friend." 

" He would stand his friend to-day, Lydia, if there 
were any need of service. If there is a distance be 
tween them, it is not, I can assure you, the Doctor's 
fault." 

" I know that, Lena. Adam proved himself unwor 
thy of such a friend. Whatever distance intervenes, he 
made it. But we will not talk of that. Good by, 
dear ! Come very soon. You don't know how much 
good it will do me." 

There was a prolonged, tightly given pressure of 
hands, and then the two friends separated. Lydia re 
turned to her large, elegantly furnished house, and to 



 

her husband who counted his gold by many thousands ; 
but returned with a heavy heart. It looked, in her 
thought, more cheerless, more desolate than ever, now 
that she had felt the love-warmth of Jena's home. 
She went, in pity and sympathy for an old friend in 
misfortune, but returned, sadly conscious that with her 
waS the misfortune, and with Lena the sunshine of a 
true prosperity. 



CHAPTER XVII. 




made by Mrs. Guy 

touching her home-life, wrought a 
painful impression on the mind of Mrs. 
Hofland, whose feelings were strongly 
interested for her old friend, and went 
out towards her in a yearning desire 
to give help, comfort, and strength to 
bear up under the heavy burdens laid 
upon her weak shoulders. She was 
in her thought nearly all the while. On the second day 
after her visit, Lena called on Mrs. Guy. It so hap 
pened, that Mr. Guy had returned home for some pur 
pose late in the forenoon, and was leaving the house, as 
Lena came up the steps. Mrs. Hofland smiled, and 
said, 

" Good morning, Mr. Guy." 

The merchant frowned, nodded coldly, and passed her 
in a rude manner. It was meant for the cut direct. 
For an instant, Lena hesitated to ring the bell. But a 
thought of her unhappy friend enabled her to throw the 
insult behind her as a thing of no account. She found 
Lydia with eyes wet from recent weeping. 

"It's the old story," said Mrs. Guy, answering her 
questioning looks of Mrs. Hofland, and trying to smile 



 

indifferently as she dried her tears, " The old story 
of strife about money." And she held up some bank 
bills that were crumpled in her hand. " I asked Adam, 
just now, for a hundred dollars ; and here are fifty, just 
half of what I need. It is always so. If I ask for 
twenty, I get ten, and hard words to make up the bal 
ance. I'm the most extravagant woman that ever lived. 
How did I manage when my whole income came 
through my needle ? ha ! So he talks. Money ! Heav 
en knows, I often wish there was none of it in the world. 
But, didn't you meet Adam at the door ? " 

" Yes; but I don't think he recognized me." 
" Not recognize you ! " Mrs. Guy's countenance 
changed a little. 

" No. He passed me with a distant nod, as if I were 
a stranger." 

The eyes of Lydia fell to the floor, and she sat mus 
ing for some time. 

" How long is it since you have met him ? " she in 
quired, looking up. 

''Nearly three years." 

" I don't see that you have changed in anything. 
But he may have forgotten -you. His thought is so fix 
ed on money and business, that it would be no matter 
of surprise if he forgot the face of one of his own chil 
dren after an absence of six months." 

" How are you ? " said Lena, after a pause, seeking 
to get away from this unpleasant theme. 

" About as usual, and that isn't much to boast of. 
But, I'm really glad to see you, and must ask forgive 
ness for so cold a welcome. I'm not always able to 



 

rally myself in a moment. I wish, sometimes, that I 
had no more feeling than a stock or a stone ; that I didn't 
care for these things. But, woman's nature is weak. 
We cannot harden under perpetual blows ; but grow 
more and more sensitive even to the last stroke that 
extinguishes life. Again, I say, forgive me. The pent 
up anguish of my spirit found an outlet in the direction 
of your sympathy, and I cannot close it again. Bear 
with me, Lena ! I know that it pains you to hear me 
speak as I am speaking, but I cannot, in the fullness of 
my heart, keep back all utterance." 

" Look away from what, in the present, dear Lydia, 
is irremediable. To bear, is to conquer. What we 
brood over, gains new vitality. As far as possible, veil 
even from your own eyes the harder aspect of your 
way in life, and look forward in hope, to some more 
pleasant future." 

" The future is darker than the present, Lena. But 
this is all wrong, I know. It isn't kind in me. I shall 
lose you again, if I worry your mind after this fashion. 
How weak and unreasonable I have become." 

Very much in this strain did Mrs. Guy ,talk during 
the visit of Lena ; and in parting, she wept bitterly, 
saying 

" I know you won't come here again. It's so wrong 
in me ; but I've grown weak and childish, and can't 
help it." 

" Come and see me often, Lydia," wa-s the kind an 
swer of Mrs. Hofland, as she kissed her unhappy friend. 
" I shall hold you always in my heart. Let me be as 
your sister. Talk to me without reserve, if talking 



 

gives any comfort, and what you say shall be sacred be 
tween us." 

" And you will come to see me, in return." 

" Oh, yes, often." 

" You are true and good, Lena, and may Heaven 
bless with richer blessings than even now rest upon 
your life," said Mrs. Guy, as they parted at the door. 

On the return of Adam Guy, at dinner time, his 
first words on meeting his wife, were 

" What did that fellow's wife want here ? " 

"I don't understand you," answered Lydia, coldly. 
" Of whom are you speaking ? ". 

" You know very well of whom I'm speaking." 

But Lydia shook her head perversely. 

" Wasn't that Dr. Honand's wife I saw at the door 
this morning ? " 

" Lena called to see me ; but you didn't mean her 
when you said that fellow's wife ? " 

" I meant her, and you know it. What did she 
want ? " 

" If you were curious on the subject, you should have 
inquired yourself," returned Mrs. Guy, with ill-disguised 
contempt in her tone and manner. " So you knew 
her ? " 

" Of course I knew her." 

" And passed her without recognition ? " 

"I did, and mean to always." 

" Why ? " 

"Because I don't like her nor her principles. She's 
not a true woman, and I warn you to have nothing to 
do with her." 



 

" Not a true woman ! Heaven save the mark ! 
Pray draw a picture of one. I would like to have 
your ideal above all things. Perhaps I might copy after 
it." 

" Oh, you can sneer ! but that amounts to nothing," 
retorted Guy, rather impotently. His wife's scorn grew 
sharper every day. 

" Look here, Adam," said Lyclia, speaking resolutely 
"I don't trouble myself in regard to your friend 
ships, and I beg you will not trouble yourself in regard 
to mine. I have been to see Lena, as I told you, and 
Lena has returned the visit. It shall be no fault of 
mine if the restored intercourse is not perpetual." 

" Very well, madam. Set yourself in defiance. 
But don't complain of the consequences. You wanted 
a hundred dollars this morning. I understand it now." 

" Lydia, who had been turning away from her hus 
band, wheeled round, under a sudden impulse, and con 
fronting him, with flashing eyes, said 

" What do you mean, sir ? " 

" I presume you understand me," was replied in a 
cold, sneering manner. " Where are the fifty dollars I 
gave you ? " 

Mrs. Guy thrust her hand into her pocket, and tak 
ing therefrom the roll of bank bills received from her 
husband a few hours before, flung them into his face, 
saying 

" There they are ! Take them again. If your soul 
is made of money, there are other souls of better ma 
terial, thank God! Adam Guy! Doctor Hofland 
and his wife don't want your money. They are richer 
 



 

than you are, or ever will be, though, you live a thous 
and years, and double your possessions each year." 

The money struck the face of Guy, and fell at his feet 
upon the floor. The act stunned him. Thei'e was a look 
and tone of defiance in his wife that overawed him for 
a little while. He did not understand the way to deal 
with this aspect of antagonism. 

" Keep your money, if you will, sir ! " added the ex 
cited and outraged woman. " I hate the name of mon 
ey. It is an offense to me. From this day, my lips 
shall not utter the word to you. Dole it out as you 
may, in miserly pittances, it will be all the same to me. 
There is not a woman in the city, sir, whose husband's 
property reaches, at the utmost, half of your possessions, 
whose wardrobe is not twice the value of mine. I have 
been ashamed to appear in company ; but that feeling 
is gone. The discredit is yours, not mine." 

" Silence, madam ! I will not hear this ! " 

As often before, when he felt himself borne down by 
his wife's indignant reaction upon outrage, Guy stood 
upon authority, and commanded silence. 

"It wont do, Adam Guy," said Lydia, with a smile 
curling her pale lip. " You may rob, but you cannot 
silence me." 

" Rob ! are you going crazed ? " 

" Yes, rob ; that is the word. He that withholds 
what is just, is as much a robber as he that plunders by 
force ; and meaner, because more cowardly. Do you 
understand me ? " 

No." 

" Turn it over in your thought as often as you turn 



 

a dollar before spending it, and perhaps the meaning 
will be clear." 

" Your precious friend has been giving you some les 
sons in duty, I see," retorted Guy. " A few more vis 
its, and I'll find the door locked against me. After 
ruining her own husband, she has become ambitious of 
more extended operations. I'll send the Doctor a note, 
requesting him to keep his vicious cattle at home." 

" Happily, the Doctor knows your quality, and will 
take the performance for what it is worth," said Mrs. 
Guy, nothing daunted by the vulgar threat. " Men 
who stand at his height, read such as you at a glance. 
Send the note. It matters nothing to me." 

Baffled by the coolness of his wife's scorn, Adam 
Guy broke out again into passionate command. Lydia 
fixed her eyes sternly upon him for some moments, hold 
ing his gaze long enough to let him understand that 
she defied him ; then, turning from him, she left the 
room. 

At his feet lay the crumpled bank bills, thrown by 
Lydia in his face a little while before. Most men, after 
such a scene, would have let them lie on the carpet, if 
certain of their being swept into the street. But, in 
his eyes, money was too precious a thing to be left in 
any jeopardy. So, stooping to the floor, Guy took up 
the bills, and thrust them into his vest pocket, mutter 
ing in an undertone 

" A good illustration of the value she sets upon mon 
ey. A man might as well pour water into a sieve, as 
place it at the discretion of such a woman." 

In spite of the insult he had received from his wife, 



 

Adam Guy felt a secret pleasure growing out of her 
declaration that she would never again ask him for 
money. He wished in his heart that she might stand 
by her threat. There was no way in which she could 
inflict self-punishment so agreeable to her husband as 
this. Her demands for money, so incessantly made, 
and so steadily resisted, he had always regarded as ex 
cessive. This had been the bone of contention between 
them from the beginning. Always doling out reluctant 
ly, and too often, in complaint of extravagance, he had 
kept Lydia so bare of money, that constant application 
became a necessity. To-day, it was two or three dol 
lars for a seamstress ; to-morrow, a dollar for the wash 
erwoman ; the day after, five dollars for market money ; 
and the day after that, a dollar and a half for sawing 
and putting away a cord of wood, for which the poor 
wood-sawyer had waited two hours. So the changes 
rung incessantly. It was literally true, as he often al 
leged " Money ! money ! nothing but money ! 
The first thing in the morning and the last thing at 
night. I can't show mys'elf without hearing the word 
money ! "
