sound ! " holding up her small hands entreatingly. 



 

Her golden hair was floating down her back. 
There was something weird about her sudden ap 
pearance, and for a moment he could not speak. 

" I'm so wretched. I had to come to tell you, 
Roy, I'm going away. I can't stand it." 

She leaned over the arm of the chair. Her eyes 
were full of tears, and her pretty mouth and chin 
quivered. She moved him inexplicably. 

" Going away Bessie " 

He touched her arm with his fingers. Was she 
walking in her sleep ! Or was he dreaming ? 

" Yes ; Aunt Hannah has as good as turned me 
out. I have a little money. I shall go away it 
doesn't matter where, since I am not wanted here. 
And if I don't find friends, I can only die in the 
end," and a sob choked her. 

" Bessie ! " He could never have told who 
made the movement. He raised his arm and put 
it over her shoulder, and she seemed to drop into 
his lap, like a poor fluttering bird, giving a sigh 
of content. 

" I thought at first you liked me. It was no 
plan of mine coming here, and how should I know 
the home wasn't really Aunt Hannah's ? And I 
tried so hard to please ! I've been a little slave all 
summer. I thought maybe I had earned some 
right to a home. But I wish she had never sent 
for me. It's been nothing but pain and misery. 



 

And as for the dressmaking scheme I hate it! 
I'll kill myself first ! " 

She was sobbing softly now, and her head went 
down on his shoulder. Roy looked at her in a 
dazed fashion. She was so small and helpless. 

" I told Aunt Hannah there was no need of 
your going. She ought to have some one, and I 
am likely to be out so much now. You shall 
stay. Why, your keep wouldn't be more than 
that of a kitten, and there is an abundance of 
everything " 

Bessie made a gesture of protest, and partly 
raised her head, enough for him to see her tear- 
wet eyes and tremulous rose-red lips. 

" I have no real claim on you. Oh," with a fling 
of bitterness, "she has made me understand that! 
The home is yours. I am no kin to you ! But I 
wanted to tell you how it was, so when you come 
home some night and hear a long tale of my in 
gratitude, you will know why I couldn't stay. 
And there have been so many pleasant times 
when " 

"You must stay, child." 

" But you see, if I was your half-sister, it would 
make a world of difference ! No ; I shall just go 
off quietly 

"You shall not, Bessie." 

What did he mean to say ? Oh, heavens ! if 



 

she only were his little sister ! She was like a 
trusting baby in his arms. The sobs shook her. 
A poor, friendless, homeless little girl, too pretty 
to take a rough turn with the world. She must 
stay. He would insist to Aunt Hannah, and the 
foolish scheme of dressmaking would be given up. 

He gave a long sigh. She crept closer. Her 
warm tears fell on his hand and moved him im 
measurably. He was man enough to see how he 
could be something more to her, have the right to 
care for her. Why, three months ago he almost 
dreamed of this. What had changed him ? For 
there was some mysterious change, some new 
understanding of himself and the man he wished 
to be. When he reached that height 

The clock ticked solemnly. It seemed the turn 
ing-point of a lifetime. Pity, sympathy, the desire 
to give this eager little butterfly a pleasant life, 
the curious inward protest, and he felt himself 
pulled both ways, unable to decide. 

They did not hear the stir above them. Then a 
sharp voice called, "Bessie! Bessie!" 

She started, but clung closer to him. Her 
small hands grasped entreatingly. Her fright 
ened, pleading child's face was upraised, it moved 
nearer his, and before he was even aware of an 
impulse, he had kissed down amid the tears. 

A quick, piercing cry for help startled them. 



 

Roy put her down and ran. There was a strange 
blaze of light in the little hall, and another cry, 
this time a shriek. 

Aunt Hannah stood in Bessie's room all in a 
blaze. The curtains had burned and fallen to the 
floor. She had reached out for the quilt on the 
bed, but some kind of terror had deprived her of 
her usual presence of mind. He caught it and 
wrapped her tight as she fell to the floor. 

" Bessie, quick ! " he cried. 

But when Bessie came up, it was only to shriek 
and wring her hands. The blue and yellow 
flames were running over the fuzz of the carpet. 
He was shuffling it out, and smothering the blaze 
about Aunt Hannah, who only moaned now. 

Then he began to unroll her. " Bring another 
blanket," he said to Bessie, and with that he 
carried her to her room. " Put out every spark of 
fire ; but oh, for the love of heaven, be careful ! " 

He laid Aunt Hannah on her own bed. She 
moaned in a half-unconscious manner. The flames 
were subdued ; but how severely she was burned 
was beyond his telling. A doctor must be had at 
once. 

" Bessie, I am going over to the Austens' to get 
some one to go for a doctor." 

She raised her lovely, terrified eyes. " Be 
brave," he pleaded, taking both hands. She in- 



clincd her head forward, and for the second time 
he kissed her. 

" Oh, what shall I do ! I have never seen any 
one die. Let me go to the Austens'. Oh, Roy ! " 

She was clinging to him, and sobbing hysteri 
cally. Her soft, wet cheek was pressed against 
his. 

" I shall die here alone," she cried. " Let me 
go with you." 

He quite forgot her selfishness at the moment, 
so deep was his pity for her terror. 

He spoke to Aunt Hannah, and besought her 
to answer. She moaned, but did not move. He 
was afraid himself to open the blanket. 

" I must go. Let me carry you down-stairs," 
and he picked her up, depositing her in the arm 
chair he had left such a few moments before. 
" Be my brave girl," he said, and the next instant 
he had vanished. 

Left alone, Bessie's weeping subsided into an 
occasional sob, though she still trembled with ap 
prehension. When she dared to move, she crept 
cautiously to both doors and locked them. No 
frightful vision could steal upon her unaware. 
What the poor victim up-stairs might be suffering 
was not as much to her as her own terror. Then 
she began to think. Why had Aunt Hannah gone 
to her room? Had she suspected her absence? 



 

She had left her lamp burning, but she had shut 
the door, she was quite certain. She would not 
allow her, Bessie, a moment alone with Roy. But 
if she should be ill a long while up-stairs, there 
would have to be a servant, and Bessie would take 
the head of the house. 

After all, she might as well marry Roy. In all 
this while she had not seemed to attract any one's 
attention. And at the Deanes' there had been 
young men coming in nearly every evening. Here 
it was really out of the way. Of course it would 
be nice to go to the city if she knew just what to 
do ; but Roy would not consent, and she had no 
money to experiment with. But to go on this 
way 

Would Roy never come back ? She kept glanc 
ing furtively at the door, almost expecting Aunt 
Hannah to order her to open it at once. She 
began to cry again, from very loneliness as she sat 
crouching there, not daring to stir. There was a 
constriction in her throat that almost strangled her. 
And it seemed as if it must be morning when the 
sound of wagon wheels broke the awesome stillness. 

She sprang up and unfastened both doors. Roy 
and Mrs. Austen came in together. 

" Oh, you poor child ! what a dreadful accident ! " 
Then Mrs. Austen glanced around. 

"She is up-stairs," explained Roy. Then he 



 

lighted another lamp and led the way. Bessie 
followed, every pulse throbbing with indefinable 
apprehension. 

The long figure lay on the bed, just as he had 
tenderly deposited it there. " Oh, heaven grant 
she may not be dead ! " he cried in sharp sorrow. 

" Has she been alone all this time and nothing 
done ? " glancing at Bessie. 

" We did not know what could be done for 
her. Sometimes inexperience hinders more than 
it helps," he said in excuse. 

Mrs. Austen opened the blanket, then folded it 
again, while a shudder ran over her. 

"I don't suppose we can do anything but just 
wait," she said hopelessly as she dropped into a 
chair. 

Bessie lighted a candle and went through to her 
own room. There was a bracket against the wall 
on which she usually placed her lamp, as her 
dressing-table, as she always called the befur- 
belowed stand, was generally full of knick-knacks. 
A little way from it was an engraving in a celluloid 
frame, and then the window curtain. The lamp 
chimney was broken* The curtain, the picture, 
and the drapery of the table were burned to 
cinders. An untoward gust of wind from the 
window might have done the mischief, or the 
sudden opening of the door creating a draught. 



 

Her bed was blackened, the quilt partly burned, 
the room was full of the odor of smothered flames. 

Yes, if Aunt Hannah had staid in her own room 
instead of prying about. With all her horror and 
dread, Bessie was not specially moved to pity, since 
she felt underneath it all Aunt Hannah's motive. 
The table, too, was one of her aversions. Bessie 
had brought with her numberless little gifts with 
which she had adorned her bare room. The pict 
ure-frame had been especially cherished. 

"You had better come down-stairs," Royal 
Palmer said, looking in. Then he added, in a 
low, solemn tone : " She is not dead. Mrs. Aus 
ten thinks she must have inhaled the flames. 
Oh, when will the doctor come ! " 

Dead ! Bessie had not thought of such an 
ending. She stood horrified. 

" Oh, she will get well again. She is so 
strong " 

" How could it have happened ? " 

" I think she heard us talking and came 
in here. She must have done something. The 
lamp is on the table and the chimney broken. 
I left it on the bracket. Oh, why are people 
so suspicious ! " 

He took her hand and led her down-stairs. 
" You had better take the lounge and get some 
rest," he said, in so grave a tone that it sounded 



 

cold. Then he opened the door, stood a moment 
listening in silence, and passed out to pace rest 
lessly up and down until the doctor came. 

Being forewarned, Doctor Bevans brought a 
satchel of useful articles. Miss Gage was still 
unconscious. Mrs. Austen had looked up some 
clothing, for the nightdress had been burned to 
shreds. Her hair at the edge of her forehead 
was badly scorched, her face and chest had 
suffered severely ; but the greatest danger was 
from inhaling the flames and smoke, and both 
had reacted upon the brain. 

She moaned a little as they moved her, but 
took no note of the voices. 

" It is a very grave matter," said the doctor. 
"You will want a good nurse, and Mrs. Ostrom 
came home a day or two ago. The burns will 
heal, but the greatest danger is from within. Did 
she give no alarm ? How did it all happen ? " 

They went over to Bessie's room. The most 
probable solution was that she had heard the 
lamp chimney break, and had gone over, to find 
the curtain and picture-frame ablaze, and tried 
to put it out without giving any alarm, being 
almost at once strangled by the smoke. Yet the 
blaze had been extinguished easily, and it seemed 
as if it ought not to have brought about such 
terrible consequences. 



 

Doctor Bevans remained until morning, but 
there was little change in the patient. Palmer 
went down-stairs, to find Bessie asleep on the 
lounge. He threw a shawl over her and stirred 
the fire, for the September morning was coming 
in chilly. No, the relationship in this case did 
not count . for much, and he sighed. But if 
Bessie should be her aunt's heir, she would have 
enough to make a new start in life, something 
that would suit her better than living at Wes- 
thorpe. 

She roused when the doctor went away. Mr. 
Palmer had made some coffee, and she arranged 
a tempting breakfast, studying him furtively mean 
while. Surely she could not be to blame. 

About nine, Mrs. Ostrom came, and Mrs. 
Austen went home. Then neighbors and friends 
dropped in with kindly sympathy and ready 
offers of help. It was a strange, exciting day. 
Jane Mason staid at night, and she and Bessie 
took the room Miss Helen had occupied. Bessie 
was curiously awe-stricken, and it stood her in 
the stead of deeper emotion. Her frightened 
eyes appealed to Roy with something beyond 
pity, yet not love, as he had come to consider 
the divine passion. 

Miss Gage died without recovering conscious 
ness. Mrs. Ostrom was one of the kindly, help- 



 

ful women with a pleasant nature, and she felt 
really sorry for Bessie, who seemed stunned by 
the sad affair. The funeral was a large one, for 
Miss Gage had been held in general esteem. 

That very evening lawyer Ralston came over 
with the will. But it had been made several years 
before. He questioned Palmer as to whether she 
had expressed any desire to alter it after her niece 
came, wondering a little that it had not been done. 

"We never dreamed of her dying," answered 
Roy. " I do not suppose she thought about it at 
all. You see she has had a very busy summer." 

With the exception of several gifts to friends 
her few thousands went to different charities in 
which she had been interested. 

" Of course she knew nothing about Bessie 
then," said Mrs. Ostrom, " but it leaves the poor 
child in an awkward position, without a penny. 
I am sorry it doesn't go to her. Hasn't she some 
other relatives ? " 

" Not that I know of," returned Palmer. Had 
fate consigned her to him ? " You will remain 
with us awhile ? " to Mrs. Ostrom. 

" If you desire it yes. She is too young and 
inexperienced to kee"p house, and besides 

Mrs. Ostrom did not finish the sentence. But 
Royal Palmer knew she could not remain unless 
he married her. 



 

Bessie was bitterly disappointed at the will. 
She threw herself upon Roy's sympathies. She 
had no friend but him, and it would have taken a 
harder heart than his to resist her in her sorrow. 
She felt that he really ought to marry her, and he 
accepted what seemed a direct interposition of 
fate, and announced his intention to Mrs. Ostrom, 
who did not seem at all surprised. 

There had not been much real love-making. It 
seemed the only course to Palmer, and Bessie ac 
cepted without being at all exigent. She had not 
loved Aunt Hannah, though she was shocked at 
her death. It seemed in a curious way to Bessie 
she did not like to say a judgment but a result 
of opposing an event that had been marked out 
by Providence. If Aunt Hannah had accepted 
and resigned herself to a conclusion so eminently 
proper, the accident might never have happened. 

She hated the sombreness of mourning, but it 
would not do to defy the opinion of Westhorpe. 
She was married in a plain white gown, in the old 
parlor. So the rose had bloomed for both funeral 
and wedding. Roy took her away on a little jour 
ney, but she felt she did not dare plead for any 
dissipations. They stopped a night in New York, 
and she wondered if they could find Thirza Rolfe. 

" Some other time we will look her up," was the 
quiet, decisive reply. Somehow he did not want 



 

to see Thirza just yet. There had been an ideal 
manliness in his mind, and he had not lived up to 
it. He had not meant his sympathy for Bessie to 
be construed into 'love. He had begun to look upon 
her as a little sister thrown on his sympathy by a 
turn of fate ; but she had taken up the only idea 
possible to her narrow mind and her longing for 
liberty marriage. His tenderness prefigured that, 
of course, he would have loved her openly before, 
but for Aunt Hannah ; and then these two women 
had infected him with their nonsensical ideas ; but 
he would soon be trained out of them, and make 
just the sort of indulgent husband she wanted. 

She would have liked to surprise Thirza with her 
husband, and have her tell the news to Miss Otis. 
They would remain friends, for a while at least ; 
yet she doubted if the Otis relatives would approve 
altogether. But she did not dare insist, and she 
acquiesced sweetly, simply biding her time with an 
obstinate faith. 

She ventured, on her return, to discuss some kind 
of reception. 

" But you are in deep mourning," he answered, 
rather surprised, " and Aunt Hannah has always 
been such a good friend to me that I feel almost 
as if I had lost a relative. Then," hesitating, while 
a little crease settled between his eyes, " you know 
so few people in Westhorpe." 




" That is the very reason I should be introduced 
into my new position," and Bessie flushed with 
vexation. " No one really understood why I was 
almost like a servant in the summer. I think 
Aunt Hannah delighted to mortify me, and I had 
been educated and trained for society. But for 
Mr. Deane's misfortune we should no doubt have 
had a summer at some fashionable place, and I 
should have married very well indeed." 

She tossed her head with a touch of injured 
dignity, then added : " You cannot put me in my 
proper place too soon." 

He made no reply, but that night consulted Mrs. 
Ostrom, who looked surprised. 

"I don't think I would do it," she said. "You 
might send out cards, and people would call by 
degrees. Aunt Hannah's awful death has given 
everybody a shock, you see, and it would make a 
talk. I would wait awhile." 



CHAPTER IX 

A WOMAN AT HOME 

IT was so utterly delightful to get a place she 
could call her own home, Thirza Rolfe thought. " I 
must have been born for an old maid," she rumi 
nated, as she was unpacking and setting to rights 
the boxes that had been sent from the storage. A 
pretty flat with a long parlor, bay-windowed in the 
front, a room between, lighted by the air shaft, a 
back room of good dimensions with range and 
boiler, two hall rooms, and bath. Miss LeClear 
had only two trunks, a table, and some pictures ; 
Miss Prentice, some antique parlor furniture and a 
bedroom suit, beside her piano. They made a list 
of things to be bought, and each elected what she 
would buy. The floors were matted all through. 
Thirza supplied some pretty rugs that she had 
acquired at bargains. She took the middle room, 
as she was likely to do considerable work at home, 
and this had a closet in which she could stow away 
a great many articles. The others would be out a 
good deal. 

The housekeeping would ' be shared between 
 



 

them. Each one had kept herself in a " furnished 
room," and took meals in or out, as it happened. 
In the late spring, when they had talked over this 
plan and made their calculations, they had been 
surprised at the greater amount of comfort and 
pleasure they would have for the money. 

"As long as we agree," said Miss LeClear, 
laughingly. " We will try it for a year, anyhow. 
It will give one a curiously settled feeling, almost 
like the first year of marriage." 

" Why the first year, merely ? " 

" Because, when you are very much in love, you 
think it will last forever." 

" And doesn't it in most cases ? " asked Miss 
Prentice. 

" Does it ? How many marriage bonds would 
hold together more than a year and a day, if 
either party were free to go ? How many do, as 
it is ? But where you must stay, you fight awhile 
with him and with yourself, and then accept, if the 
chain doesn't break easily, or if you think it wis 
dom not to break it. You see a woman can't go 
out at once and step into something to earn her 
living. Perhaps if she could, there would be more 
separations. It is an ignoble factor in matrimony. 
But when we are able to care for ourselves, we are 
not so wild to rush at the first chance that offers. 
To come back to my text : We shall be the more 



 

patient and the less exacting because we can go, 
even before our year is up, if we find it very hard 
to get along with each other. But for our own 
credit's sake we will be sure to weather through 
the showers and blasts of a year. Girls, I am not 
sure but this will be an excellent preparation for 
matrimony. We shall have some of the sharp 
corners rounded off. We shall also have learned 
to find judicious fault with muddy coffee, burnt 
toast, steak cooked too much or too little, and can 
meet the tyrant man on his own ground." 

" I am sorry there are no galleries to applaud," 
declared Miss Prentice. " After my varied experi 
ences, I have come to the conclusion that I could 
live with almost any one. I should like a choice, 
to be sure; " with an arch little gleam in her face 
that seemed to waver and flash like the sun having 
a tilt with summer cloud-drifts. 

"We must settle our belongings, and we can 
take up our arguments later on," added Thirza, 
and to work they went with a will. There was 
not much spare time in their busy lives, but they 
managed in the course of a fortnight to look as 
if they had lived there forever, Miss LeClear said, 
and on the strength of this she invited in some 
of the younger newspaper men and her friend 
Mrs. Brade, and straightway had a symposium. 
There was music and some very excellent singing, 



 

a few poems read, several capital stories told, a 
dainty and not extravagant little supper, and they 
all enjoyed themselves to the brim. It was some 
time after this when they had really settled down 
to work, even Thirza was at her table trying the 
effect of various points for an illustration, that 
her own little hall bell sounded. She had sent her 
address to Miss Brooke's care for Miss Otis, and 
was awaiting the result with a little curiosity, as 
well as interest, well aware that even friendship 
might look different through city eyes. But it 
was Helen Otis, very stylish indeed, in her 
autumnal browns, with dashes of soft dark red. 
Her smile was reassuring. 

" Oh, how delightful you are ! " she exclaimed, 
looking around eagerly. " I was afraid to come 
too soon. That flood of sunshine! " 

" Yes, we have it all the morning, thank heaven. 
It inspirits you to begin with sunshine. Later on 
your interest carries you through ; and now lay 
aside your wrap, and let us have a good, long 
chat." 

" But you were busy 

" Not so busy but that I can devote some time 
to you. And tell me about your aunts." 

Thirza seated her friend in the pretty willow 
armchair, now adorned with bright silken cushions, 
and placed a footstool within reach. 







" Yes, you are lovely. And this handful of fire 
in the grate makes the atmosphere absolutely 
beguiling. If I don't answer your question at 
once, I shall forget. Aunt Margaret is very well. 
Aunt Essie is certainly failing. But for that 
Miss Otis paused abruptly. There was a little 
awkward silence of a moment or two. 

"I half envy you," declared the guest. "Thirza, 
why couldn't the fates have given you to me for 
a sister ? I am so alone." 

" You are at home ? " ventured Thirza. 

" In my father's house, yes. But it is so differ 
ent from any plan or dream. It is all handsome 
and in good taste, and there is no fault to be found 
with Mrs. Otis, except that I wish she had re 
mained Miss Carew that we had never met her, 
indeed. She has crowded me out of my place. A 
man may love a child and a woman, but he cannot 
love two women unless they are own mother and 
daughter. And I had counted so much on papa. 
I can't seem to understand," and there was a sort 
of entreaty in her face as if she besought Thirza 
to solve the difficulty. "He wrote such charming
