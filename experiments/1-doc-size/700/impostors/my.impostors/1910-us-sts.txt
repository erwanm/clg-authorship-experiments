in the midst of love and pleasure hears the bugle 
call. He might not be able to do anything for 
Charhe. But he must try I 

And so he turned and followed the old ped- 
dler to his home. 



CHAPTER XX 

" CJO you've let them turn you into a mission 

kJ stiff!" said Charlie Swift, when the two 
were seated in his room. 

" A what? " exclaimed Samuel perplexed. 

" A mission stiff," repeated the other. " One 
of the guys that gets repentance I " 

Samuel experienced a sudden chilling of the 
ardor with which he had come into the room. The 
old grin was upon the other's face; and the hoy 
realized with a sudden sinking of the heart how 
hard and savage he was. Finnegan was a babe 
in arms compared with Charlie Swift. 

To convert him would be a real task, a test of 
one's fervor and vision. Samuel resolved sud- 
denly upon diplomacy. 

" They've been very good to me," he said. 

" I dare say," responded the other indiffer- 
ently. 

" And Dr. Vince is really a very good man," 
he went on. 

" Humph! " commented the burglar; and then 
he added quickly, " You haven't been telling him 
anything about me? " 

" Oh, no! " exclaimed the boy. 



"Not a word?" 

" Have you forgotten that I promised you? " 

" That's all right," said Charhe, " only I just 
wanted to warn you. You can tie up with the 
church guys if you feel like it — only don't men- 
tion your lost brothers down in the pit. Just you 
remember that I got some of the doctor's silver." 

The boy gave a start. " Oh I " he exclaimed. 

" Didn't you know that? " laughed the other. 

" No, I didn't know it." 

" What did you suppose I was doing all that 
time while you were watching? " 

Samuel said nothing for a minute. " Why did 
you pick out Dr. Vince? " he asked suddenly. 

" Him? Why not? I knew his house." 

" But a clergyman! Does it seem quite fair? " 

" Oh, that's all right," laughed the other. 
" He's got a-plenty. It don't have to come out 
of his salary, you know." 

" Why not? " 

" Because, he's got a rich wife. You didn't 
suppose he lived in that palace of a house on his 
own salary, did you? " 

" I hadn't thought anything about it." 

" Well, he's all right — he married one of the 
richest girls in town. And she'll keep his nest 
feathered." 

There was a pause. " Don't you think that 
Dr. Vince is a good man? " asked Samuel. 





" I don't know," said the other. " I've got no 
quarrel with him. But I don't like his trade." 

" Doesn't he do a great deal of good to 
people? " 

" Maybe," said the other, shrugging his shoul- 
ders. 

" To poor people? " persisted Samuel. 

" I dare say," admitted Charlie. " But you'll 
notice it takes all the sand out of them — makes 
them into beggars. And I ain't that sort." 

" Why do you think he tries to help them? " 

" Well, he gets paid for it, don't he? " 

" But the other people in the church — the ones 
who pay the money. Why do you think they 
do it? " 

The burglar thought for a moment. " I reckon 
they do it to make themselves feel good," he 
said. 

" To make themselves feel good," repeated the 
other perplexed. 

"Sure!" said the man. "You take one of 
those rich women — she's got a lot of money that 
she never earned, and she spends all her life 
amusing herself and ordering servants about. 
And all the time she knows that most of the peo- 
ple — the people that do the work — are suffering 
and dying. And she don't want to let that make 
her feel bad, so she hires some fellow hke your 
friend, the doctor, to preach to 'em — and maybe 





give 'em a turkey at Christmas. And that takes 
the trouble oflF her mind. Don't you see? " 

" Yes," said the other weakly. " I see." 

" Or else," added Charlie, " take some of those 
smooth grafters they've got up there — the men, 
I mean. They spend six days in the week cutting 
other people's throats, and robbing the public. 
Don't you think it's handy for them to know they 
can come on Sunday and drop a five-dollar-bill 
in the plate, and square the whole account? " 

Samuel sought for a reply to these cruel taunts. 
" I don't think you put it quite fairly," he pro- 
tested. 

" Why not? " demanded the other. 

" In the first place, men like that wouldn't go 
to church " 

Charlie stared at him. "What!" he ex- 
claimed. 

" No," said the boy. 

"Why not?" 

" Well, why should they care to go? And they 
wouldn't be welcome " 

Charlie burst into laughter. " You poor kid! " 
he exclaimed. " What have you been doing up 
there at St. Matthew's, anyhow? " 

" I'm the sexton's assistant," said Samuel 
gravely. 

" Yes," said the other. " Evidently a sexton's 
assistant doesn't see much of the congregation." 





I wish you'd explain," remarked the boy 
after a pause. 

" I hardly know where to begin," replied the 
other. " They've such a choice collection of 
crooks up there. Did you ever notice a little pot- 
belhed fellow with mutton-chop whiskers — looks 
as if he was eating persimmons all the time? " 

" You mean Mr. Hickman? " 

" Yes, that's the chap. He's one of the pillars 
of the church, isn't he? " 

" I suppose so," said Samuel. " He's one of 
the vestrymen." 

" And did you ever hear of Henry Hickman 
before? " 

" I know he's a famous lawyer; and I was told 
that he managed the Lockman estate." 

" Yes," said Charlie, " and I suppose you don't 
know what that means! " 

" No," admitted Samuel, " I don't." 

" It means," went on the other, " that he was 
old Lockman's right-hand man, and had his 
finger in every dirty job that the old fellow ever 
did for thirty years. And it means that he runs 
the business now, and does all the crooked work 
that has to be done for it." 

There was a pause. " For instance, what? " 
asked Samuel in a low voice. 

" For instance, politics," said the other. 
" Steering the grafters oflP the Lockman preserve. 





Getting the right men named by the machine, 
and putting up the dough to elect them. Last 
year the Democrats got in, in spite of all he 
could do; and he had to buy the city council 
outright." 

" WbatI " gasped the boy in horror. 

" Siu-e thing," laughed Charlie — " there was 
an independent water company trying to break 
in, and the Democrats were pledged to them. 
They say it cost Hickman forty-five thousand 
dollars." 

" But do you know that? " cried the other. 

" Know it, Sammy? Why everybody in town 
knows it. It was a rotten steal, on the face of it." 

Samuel was staring at him. " I can't believe 
it! " he exclaimed. 

" Nonsense! " laughed the other. " Ask round 
a bit I " And then he added quickly, " Why, see 
here — didn't you tell me you knew Billy Finne- 
gan — the barkeeper? " 

" Yes, I know him." 

" Well, then, you can go right to headquarters 
and find out. His boss, John Callahan, was one 
of the supervisors — he got the dough. Go and 
ask Finnegan." 

" But will he tell? " exclaimed Samuel. 

" I guess he'll tell," said Charlie, " if you go 
at him right. It's no great secret — the whole 
town's been laughing about it." 





Samuel was almost too shocked for words. 
" Do you suppose Dr. Vince knows it? " he cried. 

" He don't know much if he doesn't," was the 
other's reply. 

"A member of his church!" gasped the boy. 

"Oh, pshaw!" laughed the other. "You're 
too green, Sammy! What's the church got to do 
with business? Why, look — there's old Wygant 
— another of the vestrymen! " 

" Miss Gladys' father, you mean? " 

" Yes ; old Lockman's brother-in-law. He's the 
other trustee of the estate. And do you suppose 
there's any rascality he doesn't know about? " 

" But he's a reformer! " cried the boy wildly. 

" Siu-e ! " laughed Charlie. " He made a speech 
at the college commencement about representa- 
tive government; I suppose you read it in the 
Express. But all the same, when the Democrats 
got in, his nibs came round and made his terms 
with Slattery, the new boss; and they get along 
so well it'll be his money that will put them in 
again next year." 

" But tiohy? " cried Samuel dazed. 

" For one thing," said Charlie, " because he's 
got to have his man in the State legislature, to 
beat the child-labor bill." 

"The child-labor bill!" 

" Surely. You knew he was fighting it, didn't 
you? They wanted to prevent children imder 





fourteen from working in the cotton mills. Wy- 
gant sent Jack Pemberton up to the Capital for 
nothing at all but to beat that law." 

Samuel sat with his hands clenched tightly. 
Before him there had come the vision of httle So- 
phie Stedman with her wan and haggard face I 
" But why does he want the children in his mill? " 
he cried. 

" Why? " echoed Charhe. " Good God! Be- 
cause he can pay them less and work them harder. 
Did you suppose he wanted them there for their 
health? " 

There was a long pause. The boy was wrest- 
ling with the most terrible specter that had yet 
laid hold upon him. " I don't believe he knows 
it! " he whispered half to himself. " I don't be- 
lieve it!" 

" Who? " asked the other. 

" Dr. Vince! " said the boy. And he rose sud- 
denly to his feet. " I will go and see him about 
it," he said. 

" Go and see him! " echoed Charlie. 

"Yes. He will tell me!" 

Charhe was gazing at him with a broad grin. 
" I dare you! " he cried. 

" I am going," said the boy simply; and the 
burglar slapped his thigh in delight. 

" Go on! " he chuckled. " Sock it to him, Sam- 
my! And come back and tell me about it! " 



CHAPTER XXI 

" T~' -"-  * lunch," said the maid who 

JL-/ answered the bell. 

" Please tell him I must see him at once," said 
Samuel. " It's something very important." 

He went in and sat down in the library, and 
the doctor came, looking anxious. " What is it 
now? " he asked. 

And Samuel turned to him aJFace of anguish. 
" Doctor," he said, " I've just had a terrible ex- 
perience." 

" What is it, Samuel? " 

" I hardly know how to tell you," said the boy. 
" I know a man — a very wicked man ; and I went 
to him to try to convert him, and to bring him 
into the church. And he laughed at me, and at 
the church, too. He said there are wicked men 
in it — in St. Matthew's, Dr. Vince! He told me 
who they are, and what they are doing! And, 
doctor — I can't believe that you know about it 
— that you would let such things o on! " 

The other was staring at him in alarm. " My 
dear boy," he said, " there are many wicked men 
in the world, and I cannot know everything." 

" Ah, but this is terrible, doctor ! You will have 


to find out about it — you cannot let such men stay 
in the church." 

The other rose and closed the door of his study. 
Then he drew his chair close to Samuel. " Now," 
he said, " what is it? " 

" It's Mr. Wygant," said Samuel. 

" Mr, Wygant ! " cried the other in dismay. 

" Yes, Dr. Vince." 

" What has he done? " 

" Did you know that it was he who beat the 
child-labor bill — that he named the State senator 
on purpose to do it? " 

The doctor was staring at him. " The child- 
labor bill!" he gasped. "Is that what you 
mean? " 

" Yes, Dr. Vince," said Samuel. " Surely you 
didn't know that!" 

" Why, I know that Mr. Wygant is very much 
opposed to the bill. He has opposed it openly. 
He has a perfect right to do that, hasn't he? " 

" But to name the State senator to beat it, doc- 
tor!" 

" Well, my boy, Mr. Wygant is very much 
interested xa. politics; and, of course, he would 
use his influence. Why not? " 

"But, Dr. Vince — it was a wicked thing! 
Think of Sophie!" 

" But, my boy — haven't we found Sophie a 
place in Mr. Wygant's own home? " 




"Yes, doctor! But there are all the others! 
Think of the suffering and misery in that dread- 
ful mill! And Mr. Wygant pays such low wages. 
And he is such a rich man — he might help the 
children if he would." 

" Really, Samuel — " began the doctor. 

But the boy, seeing the frown of displeasure 
on his face, rushed on swiftly. " That's only the 
beginning! Listen to me! There's Mr. Hick- 
man ! " 

"Mr. Hickman!" 

" Mr. Henry Hickman, the lawyer. He has 
done even worse things " 

And suddenly the clergyman clenched his 
hands. " Really, Samuel! " he cried. " This is 
too much! You are exceeding all patience! " 

" Doctor! " exclaimed the boy in anguish. 

" It seems to me," the doctor continued, " that 
you owe it to me to consider more carefully. You 
have been treated very kindly here — you have 
been favored in more ways than one." 

" But what has that to do with it? " cried the 
other wildly. 

"It is necessary that you should remember 
your place. It is certainly not becoming for you, 
a mere boy, and filling a subordinate position, to 
come to me with gossip concerning the vestry of 
my church." 

"A subordinate position!" echoed Samuel 





dazed. *' But what has my position to do witH 
it? " 

" It has a great deal to do with it, Samuel." 

The boy was staring at him. " You don't un- 
derstand mel " he cried. " I am not doing this 
for myself I I am not setting myself up I I am 
thinking of the saving of the church ! " 

" What do you mean — saving the chtu-ch? " 

" Why, doctor — just seel I went to reform a 
man; and he sneered at me. He would not have 
anything to do with the church, because such 
wicked men as Mr. Hickman were in it. He said 
it was their money that saved them from exposiu:e 
— he said " 

"What has Mr. Hickman done?" demanded 
the other quickly. 

" He bribed the city council, sir I He bribed 
it to beat the water bill." 

Dr. Vince got up from his chair and began to 
pace the floor nervously. "Tell me, doctor !" 
cried Samuel. " Please tell me ! Surely you 
didn't know that!" 

The other turned to him suddenly. " I don't 
think you quite realize the circumstances," said 
he. " You come to me with this tale about Mr.' 
Hickman. Do you know that he is my brother- 
in-law? " 

Samuel clutched the arms of his chair and stared 
aghast. " Yoiu" brother-in-law! " he gasped. 





" Yes," said the other. " He is my wife's only 
brother." 

Samuel was dumb with dismay. And the doc- 
tor continued to pace the floor. " You see," he 
saidj " the position you put me in." 

" Yes," said the boy. " I see. It's very ter- 
rible." But then he rushed on in dreadful 
anxiety: "But, doctor, you didn't know it. 
Oh, I'm sure — please tell me that you didn't 
know it!" 

"I didn't know it!" exclaimed the doctor. 
"And what is more, I don't know it now! I 
have heard these rumors, of course. Mr. Hick- 
man is a man of vast responsibilities, and he has 
many enemies. Am I to believe every tale that 
I hear about him? " 

" No," said Samuel, taken aback. " But this 
is something that everyone knows." 

" Everyone ! " cried the other. " Who is every- 
one? Who told it to you? " 

" I — I can't tell," stammered the boy, 

" How does he know it? " continued the doc- 
tor. " And what sort of a man is he? Is he a 
good man? " 

" No," admitted Samuel weakly. " I am afraid 
he is not." 

" Is he a man who loves and serves others? A 
man who never speaks falsehood — whom you 
would beheve in a matter that involved yom- dear- 





est friends? Would believe him if he told you 
that I was a briber and a scoundrel? " 

Samuel was obliged to admit that Charlie 
Swift was not a man like that. " Dr. Vince," he 
said quickly, " I admit that I am at fault. I 
have come to you too soon. I will find out about 
these things; and if they are true, I will prove 
them to you. If they are not, I will go away in 
shame, and never come to trouble you again as 
long as I live." 

Samuel said this very humbly; and yet there 
was a note of grim resolution in his voice — which 
the doctor did not fail to note. " But, Samuel ! " 
he protested. "Why — why should you meddle 
in these things? " 

"Meddle in them!" exclaimed the other. 
" Surely, if they are true, I have to. You don't 
mean that if they were proven, you would let 
such men remain in your church? " 

" I don't think," said the doctor gravely, " that 
I can say what I should do in case of anything 
so terrible." 

" No," was Samuel's reply, " you are right. 
,The first thing is to find out the truth." 

And so Samuel took his departure. 

He went straight to his friend Finnegan. 

" Hello ! " exclaimed Finnegan. Then, 
" What about that job of mine? " he asked with 
a broad grin. 





" Dr. Vince says he will look out for you," was 
the boy's reply. "But I'm not ready to talk 
about that yet. There's something else come up." 

He waited imtil his friend had attended to the 
wants of a customer, and until the customer had 
consumed a glass of beer and departed. Then 
he called the bartender into a corner. 

" Mr. Finnegan," he said, " I want to know 
something very important." 

" What is it? " asked the other. 

" Do you know Mr. Hickman — Henry Hick- 
man, the lawyer? " 

" He's not on my calling list," said Finnegan. 
" I know him by sight." 

" I've heard it said that he had something to 
do with beating a water bill in the city council. 
Did he? " 

" You bet your life he did ! " said the bartender 
with a grin. 

" Is it true that he bought up the council? " 

" You bet your life it's true! " 

" And is it true that Mr. Callahan got some of 
the money? " 

Finnegan glanced at the other suspiciously. 
" Say," he said, " what's all this about, anyhow? " 

" Listen," said Samuel gravely. " You know 
that Mr. Hickman is a member of my church. 
And he's Dr. Vince's brother-in-law, which makes 
it more complicated yet. Dr. Vince has heard 





these terrible stories, and you can see how awk- 
ward it is for him. He cannot let such evil-doers 
go unrebuked." 

"Geel" said the other. "What's he going 
to do? " 

" I don't know," said Samuel. " He hasn't 
told me that. First, you see, he has to be sure 
that the thing is true. And, of course, Mr. Hick- 
man wouldn't tell." 

" No," said Finnegan. " Hardly! " 

" And it isn't easy for the doctor to find out. 
lYou see — he's a clergyman, and he only meets 
good people. But I told him I would find out 
for him. 

" I see," said Finnegan. 

" What I want," said the boy, " is to be able 
to tell him that I heard it from the lips of one 
of the men who got the money. I won't have to 
say who it is — he'll take my word for that. Do 
you suppose Mr. Callahan would talk about it? " 

The bartender thought for a moment. " You 
wait here," he said. " The boss has only stepped 
round the corner; and perhaps I can get the doc- 
tor what he wants." 

So Samuel sat down and waited ; and in a few
