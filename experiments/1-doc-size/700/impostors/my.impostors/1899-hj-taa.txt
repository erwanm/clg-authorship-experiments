but the eyes he raised to his benefactor had the oddest 
effect of marking that personage himself as the source of 
the lesson. 

Mr. Cashmore, who would have been very red-headed 
if he had not been very bald, showed a single eye-glass 
and a long upper lip ; he was large and jaunty, with little 
petulant movements and intense ejaculations that were 
not in the line of his type. " You may say anything you 
like if you don't say you'll repay it. That's always non- 
sense — I hate it." 

Harold remained sad, but showed himself really supe- 
rior. ' Then I won't say it." Pensively, a minute, he 
appeared to figure the words, in their absurdity, on the 
lips of some young man not, like himself, tactful. ' I 
know just what you mean." 

 ' But I think, you know, that you ought to tell your 
father," Mr. Cashmore said. 

" Tell him I've borrowed of you ?" 

Mr. Cashmore good-humoredly demurred. " It would 
serve me right — it's so shocking my having listened to 
you. Tell him, certainly," he went on after an instant. 
" But what I mean is that if you're in such straits you 
should speak to him like a man." 

Harold smiled at the innocence of a friend who could 
suppose him not to have exhausted that resource. " I'm 
always speaking to him like a man, and that's just what 
puts him so awfully out. He denies to my face that I 
am one. One would suppose, to hear him, not only that 



To a small objectionable child, but that I'm scarcely even 
liiiman. He cloesn t conceive me as with any wants." 

"Oh!' Mr. Cashmore laughed, "you've all — you young- 
sters — as many wants, I know, as an advertisement page 
of the Tunes." 

Harold showed an admiration. " That's awfully good. 
If you think you ought to speak of it," he continued, "do 
it rather to mamma." He noted the hour. "I'll go, if 
you'll excuse me, to give you the chance." 

The visitor referred to his own watch. "It's jonv 
mother herself who gives the chances — the chances yoio 
take." 

Harold looked kind and simple. "She has come in, I 
know. She'll be with you in a moment." 

He was half-way to the door, but Mr. Cashmore, though 
so easy, had not done with him. " I suppose you mean 
that if it's only your mother who's told, you may depend 
on her to shield you." 

Harold turned this over as if it were a questionable 
sovereign, but on second thoughts he wonderfully smiled. 
" Do you think that after you've let me have it you can 
tell ? You could, of- course, if you hadn't." He appeared 
to work it out for Mr. Oashmore's benefit. " But I don't 
mind," he added, "your telling mamma." 

"Don't mind, you mean, really, its annoying her so 
awfully ?" 

The invitation to repent thrown off in this could only 
strike the young man as absurd — it was so previous to 
any enjoyment. Harold liked things in their proper 
order ; but, at the same time, his evolutions were quick. 
"I dare say I am selfish, but what I was thinking was 
that the terrific wigging, don't you know ? — well, I'd take 
it from her. She knows about one's life — about our hav- 
ing to go on, by no fault of our own, as our parents start 
us. She knows all about wants — no one has more than 







  

Mr. Oashmore stared, but there was amusement in it 
too. '' So she'll say it's all right ?" 

  Oh no ; she'll let me have it hot. But she'll recog- 
nize that, at such a pass, more must be done for a fellow, 
and that may lead to something — indirectly, don't you 
see ? for she won't tell my father, she'll only, in her own 
way, work on him — that will put me on a better footing, 
and for which, therefore, at bottom, I shall have to thank 
you. " 

The eye assisted by Mr. Cashmore's glass had fixed, 
during this address, with a discernible growth of some- 
thing like alarm, the subject of his beneficence. The 
thread of their relations somehow lost itself in this subtler 
twist, and he fell back on mere stature, position and prop- 
erty, things always convenient in the presence of crook- 
edness.   I shall say nothing to your mother, but I 
think I shall be rather glad that you're not a son of 
mine." 

Harold wondered at this new element in their talk. 
"Do your sons never — ?" 

" Borrow money of their mother's visitors ?" Mr. 
Cashmore had taken him up, eager, evidently, quite to 
satisfy him; but the question was caught on the wing 
by Mrs. Brookenham herself, who had opened the door 
as her friend spoke and who quickly advanced with an 
echo of it. 

" Lady Fanny's visitors ?" — and, though her eyes rather 
avoided than met his own, she seemed to cover her lady- 
ship's husband with a vague but practised sympathy. 
'' What on earth are you saying to Harold about them ?" 
Thus it was that at the end of a few minutes Mr. 
Cashmore, on the sofa face to face with her, found his 
consciousness quite purged of its actual sense of his 
weakness and a new turn given to the idea of what, in 
one's very drawing-room, might go on behind one's back. 
Harold had quickly vanished— had been tacitly disposed 





 

of, and Mrs. Brook's caller had moved, even in the short 
space of time, so far in quite another direction as to have 
drawn from her the little cold question: '' Presents'? 
You don't mean money?" 

He clearly felt the importance of expressing at least 
by his silence and his eye-glass what he meant. " Her 
extravagance is beyond everything, and though there 
:ire bills enough, God knows, that do come in to me, I 
don't see how she pulls through unless there are others 
that go elsewhere." 

Mrs. Brookenham had given him his tea — her own 
she had placed on a small table near her, and she could 
now respond freely to the impulse felt, on this, of set- 
tling herself to something of real interest. Except to 
Harold she was incapable of reproach, though there were 
shades, of course, in her resignation, and her daughter's 
report of her to Mr. Longdon as conscious of an ab- 
sence of prejudice would have been justified, for a spec- 
tator, by the particular feeling that Mr. Cashmere's 
speech caused her to disclose. What did this feeling 
wonderfully appear unless strangely irrelevant ? "  I've 
no patience when I hear you talk as if you weren't hor- 
ribly rich." 

He looked at her an instant as if with the fancy that 
she might have derived that impression from Harold. 
" What has that to do with it ? Does a rich man enjoy 
any more than a poor his wife's making a fool of him ?" 

Her eyes opened wider : it was one of her very few 
ways of betraying amusement. There was little indeed 
to be amused at here except his choice of the particular 
invidious name. ''' You know I don't believe a word you 
say." 

Mr. Oashmore drank his tea, then rose to carry the cup 
somewhere and put it down, declining, with a motion, 
any assistance. When he was on the sofa again he re- 
sumed their intimate talk. " I like tremendously to be 





  

with you, but yon mustn't think Tve come here to let 
yoa say to me such dreadful things as that." He was an 
odd compound, Mr. Oashmore, and the air of personal 
good health, the untarnished bloom whicli sometimes 
lent a monstrous serenity to his mention of the barely 
mentionable, was on occasion balanced or matched by his 
playful application of extravagant terms to matters of 
much less moment. ' You know what I come to you 
for, Mrs. Brook : I won't come any more if you're going 
to be horrid and impossible." 

 ' You come to me, I suppose, because — for my deep 
misfortune, I assure you — I've a kind of vision of things, 
of the wretched miseries in which you all knot your- 
selves up, which you yourselves are as little blessed with 
as if, tumbling about together in your heap, you were a 
litter of blind kittens." 

" Awfully good, that — you do lift the burden of my 
trouble !" He had laughed out, in the manner of the 
man who made notes, for platform use, of things that 
might serve ; but the next moment he was grave again, 
as if his observation had reminded him of Harold's praise 
of his wit. It was in this sj)irit that he abruptly brought 
out : '  Where, by-the-way, is your daughter ?" 

'' I haven't the least idea. I do all I can to enter into 
her life, but you can't get into a railway train while it's 
on the rush." 

Mr. Oashmore swung back to hilarity. '' You give me 
lots of things. Do you mean she's so  ' fast ' ?" He could 
keep the ball going. 

Mrs. Brookenham hesitated. '' No ; she's a tremen- 
dous dear, and we're great friends. But she has her free 
young life, which, by that law of our time that I'm sure 
I only want, like all other laws, once I know what they 
are, to accept — she has her precious freshness of feeling 
which I say to myself that, so far as control is concerned, 
I ought to respect. I try to get her to sit with me, and 





 

she does so often, because she's kind. But before I know 
it she leaves me again : she feels that her presence makes 
a difference in one's liberty of talk." 

Mr. Cashmore was struck by this picture. "That's 
awfully charming of her." 

"Isn't it too dear?" The thought of it, for Mrs. 
Brook, seemed fairly to open out vistas. " The modern 
daughter !" 

" But not the ancient mother !" Mr. Cashmore smiled. 

She shook her head with a world of accepted woe. 
" '-Give me back, give me back one hour of my youth' ? 
Oh, I haven't a single thrill left to answer a compliment. 
I sit here now face to face with things as they are. They 
come in their turn, I assure you — and they find me," 
Mrs. Brook sighed, "ready. Nanda has stepped on the 
stage, and I give her up the house. Besides," she went 
on musingly, " it's awfully interesting. It is the modern 
daughter — we're really ' doing ' her, the child and I ; and 
as the modern has always been my own note — I've gone 
in, I mean, frankly for my very own Time— who is one, 
after all, that one should pretend to decline to go where 
it may lead ?" Mr. Cashmore was unprepared with an 
answer to this question, and his hostess continued in a 
different tone : "It's sweet her sparing one I" 

This, for the visitor, was firmer ground. " Do you 
mean about talking before her ?" 

Mrs. Brook's assent was positively tender. " She won't 
have a difference in my freedom. It's as if the dear thing 
hieiu, don't you see ? what we must keep back. She wants 
us not to have to think. It's quite maternal !" she mused 
again. Then, as if with the pleasure of presenting it to 
him afresh : " That's the modern daughter !" 

" Well," said Mr. Cashmore, "I can't help wishing she 
were a trifle less considerate. In that case I might find 
her with you, and I may tell you frankly that I get more 
from her than I do from you. She has the great merit 





  

for me, in the first place, of not being such an admirer of 
my wife." 

Mrs. Brookenham took this up with interest. '' No — 
you're right ; she doesn't, as I do, see Lady Fanny, and 
that's a kind of mercy." 

 '  There you are, then, you inconsistent creature," he 
cried with a laugh ; ''after all you do believe me. You 
recognize how benighted it would be for your daughter 
not to feel that Fanny's bad." 

"You're too tiresome, my dear man," Mrs. Brook re- 
turned, " with your ridiculous simplifications. Fanny's 
not ' bad'; she's magnificently good — in the sense of being 
generous and simple and true, too adorably unaffected 
and without the least mesquinerie. She's a great calm 
silver statue." 

Mr.Cashmore showed, on this, something of the strength 
that comes from the practice of public debate. " Then 
why are you glad that your daughter doesn't like her ?" 

Mrs. Brook smiled as with the sadness of having too 
much to triumph. ''Because I'm not, like Fanny, with- 
out mesquinerie, I'm not generous and simple. I'm ex- 
aggeratedly anxious about Nanda. I care, in spite of 
myself, for what people may say. Your wife doesn't — 
she towers above them. I can be a shade less brave 
through the chance of my girl's not happening to feel her 
as the rest of us do." 

Mr. Cashmore too heavily followed. "To 'feel' her?" 

Mrs. Brook floated over. " There would be, in that 
case perhaps, something to hint to her not to shriek on 
the house-tops. "When you say," she continued, "that 
one admits, as regards Fanny, anything wrong, you per- 
vert dreadfully what one does freely grant — that she's a 
great glorious pagan. It's a real relief to know such a 
type — it's like a flash of insight into history. None the 
less, if you ask me why then it isn't all right for young 
things to 'shriek' as I say, I have my answer perfectly 





 

ready.'" After which, as her visitor seemed not only too 
reduced to doubt it, but too baffled to distinguish audi- 
bly, for his credit, between resignation and admiration, 
she produced :  '' Because she's purely instinctive. Her 
instincts are splendid — but it's terrific." 

"That's all I ever maintained it to be !" Mr. Cashmore 
cried. " It is terrific." 

" Well," his friend answered, " I'm watching her. 
We're all watching her. It's like some great natural 
poetic thing — an Alpine sunrise or a big high tide." 

"You're amazing!" Mr. Cashmore laughed. "I'm 
watching her too." 

"And I'm also watching you," Mrs. Brook lucidly con- 
tinued. "What I don't for a moment believe is that her 
bills are paid by any one. It's mitch more probable," she 
sagaciously observed, "that they're not paid at all." 

"Oh, well, if she can get on that way — !" 

" There can't be a place in London," Mrs. Brook pur- 
sued, "where they're not delighted to dress such a wom- 
an. She shows things, don't you see ? as some great 
massive wall shows placards and posters. And what 
proof can you adduce ?" she asked. 

Mr. Cashmore had grown restless ; he picked a stray 
thread off the knee of his trousers. " Ah, when you talk 
about 'adducing' — !" He appeared to intimate, as if 
with the hint that if she didn't take care she might bore 
him, that it was the kind of word he used only in the 
House of Commons. 

" When I talk about it you can't meet me," she placid- 
ly returned. But she fixed him with her weary penetra- 
tion. "Yon try to believe what you can't believe, in 
order to give yourself excuses. And she does the same — 
only less, for she recognizes less, in general, the need of 
them. She's so grand and simple." 

Poor Mr. Cashmore stared. "Grander and simpler 
than I, you mean ?" 





  

Mrs. Brookenliam thought. "Not simpler — no; but 
very much grander. She wouldn't in the case you con- 
ceive, recognize really the need of what you conceive." 

Mr. Oashmore wondered — it was almost mystic.  'I 
don t understand you." 

Mrs. Brook seeing it all from dim depths, tracked it 
further and further. " We've talked her over so" 

Mr. Cashmore groaned as if too conscious of it. " In- 
deed we have" 

"I mean ive" — and it was wonderful how her accent 
discriminated. 'MYe've talked you too — but of course 
we talk every one." She had a pause through which 
there glimmered a ray from luminous hours, the inner 
intimacy which, privileged as he was, he couldn't pretend 
to share; then she broke out almost impatiently : "AVe're 
looking after her — leave her to us I" 

He looked suddenly so curious as to seem really envi- 
ous, but he tried to throw it off.  'I doubt if, after all, 
you're good for her." 

But Mrs. Brookenham knew. '  She's just the sort of 
person we are good for, and the thing for her is to be 
with us as much as possible — just live with us naturally 
and easily, listen to our talk, feel our confidence in her, 
be kept up, don't you know ? by the sense of what we 
expect of her splendid type, and so, little by little, let 
our influence act. AVhat I meant to say just now is that 
I do perfectly see her taking what you call presents." 

"Well, then," Mr. Cashmore inquired, "what do you 
want more ?" 

Mrs. Brook hung fire an instant — she seemed on the 
point of telling him. " I don't see her, as I said, recog- 
nizing the obligation." 

" The obligation— ?" 

" To give anything back. -Anything at all." Mrs. 
Brook was positive. " The comprehension of petty cal- 
culations ? Never !" 



 

''I don t say the calculations are petty," Mr. Cashmore 
objected. 

" Well, she's a great creature. If she does fall — '' His 
hostess lost herself in the view, which was at last all be- 
fore her. "Be sure we shall all know it." 

" That's exactly what I'm afraid of !" 

' Then don't be afraid till we do. She would fall, as 
it were, on ics, don't you see ? and/' said Mrs. Brook 
with decision this time in her head-shake, '' that couldn't 
be. We must keep her up — thafs your guarantee. It's 
rather too much," she added with the same increase of 
briskness,  '' to have to keep you up too. Be very sure 
that if Carrie really wavers — " 

" Carrie ?" 

His interruption was clearly too vague to be sincere, 
and it was as such that, going straight on, she treated it. 
 '' I shall never again give her three minutes' attention. 
To answer to you for Fanny without being able — " 

" To answer to Fanny for me, do you mean ?" He had 
flushed quickly as if he awaited her there.  '' It wouldn't 
suit you, you contend? Well then, I hope it will ease 
you oif," he went on with spirit, "to know that I wholly 
loathe Mrs. Donner." 

Mrs. Brook, staring, met the announcement with an 
absolute change of color. "And since when, pray ?" It 
was as if a fabric had crumbled. " She was here but the 
other day, and as full of you, poor thing, as an Qgg of 
meat." 

Mr. Cashmore could only blush for her. " I don't say 
she wasn't. My life's a burden from her." 

Nothing, for a spectator, could have been so odd as 
Mrs. Brook's disappointment unless it had been her de- 
termination. " Have you done with her already ?" 

" One has never done with a buzzing insect — " 

"Until one has literally killed it ?" Mrs. Brookenham 
wailed. " I can't take that from you, my dear man : it 





  

was yonrself who originally distilled the poison that 
courses through her veins." He jumped up, at this, as 
if he couldn t bear it, presenting as he walked across the 
room, however, a large, foolish, fugitive back, on which 
her eyes rested as on a proof of her penetration.    If you 
spoil everything by trying to deceive me, how can I help 
you ?" 

He had looked, in his restlessness, at a picture or two, 
but he finally turned round.  'With whom is it you 
talk us over ? With Petherton and his friend Mitchy ? 
With your adored Vanderbank ? With your awful Duch- 
ess r 

'' You know my little circle, and you've not always de- 
spised it." She met him on his return with a figure that 
had visibly flashed out for her.  '  Don't foul your own 
nest ! Remember that, after all, we've more or less pro- 
duced you." She had a smile that attenuated a little 
her image, for there were things that, on a second 
thought, he appeared ready to take from her. She 
patted the sofa as if to invite him again to be seated, 
and, though he still stood before her, it was with a face 
that seemed to show how her touch went home. " You 
know I've never quite thought you do us full honor, but it 
was because she took you for one of us that Carrie first — " 

At this, to stop her, he dropped straight into the seat. 
"I assure you there has really been nothing." With a 
continuation of his fidget he pulled out his watch. 
'' Won't she come in at all V' 

" Do you mean Nanda ?" 

" Talk me over with her" he smiled, '' if you like. If 
you don't believe Mrs. Donner is dust and ashes to me," 
he continued, "you do little Justice to your daughter." 

"Do you wish to break it to me that you're in love 
with her f 

He hesitated, but only as if to give weight to his reply. 
" Awfully. I can't tell you how I like her." 





 

She wondered. " And pray how will that help me ? 
Help me, I mean, to help you. Is it what I'm to tell 
your wife ?" 

He sat looking away, but he evidently had his idea, 
which he at last produced.  '' Why wouldn't it be just 
the thing ? It would exactly prove my purity."' 

There might have been in her momentary silence a 
hint of acceptance of it as a practical contribution to 
their problem, and there were indeed several lights in 
which it could be considered. Mrs. Brook, on a quick 
survey, selected the ironic. '  I see, I see. I might, by 
the same law, arrange somehow that Lady Fanny should 
find herself in love with Edward. That would ''prove' 
her purity. And you could be quite at ease," she laughed 
— "he wouldn't make any presents !" 

Mr. Oashmore regarded her with a candor that was al- 
most a reproach to her mirth. " I like your daughter 
better than I like you." 

But it only amused her more. " Is that perhaps be- 
cause I don't prove your purity ?" 

What he might have replied remained in the air, for 
the door opened so exactly at the moment she spoke that 
he rose again with a start and the butler, coming in, re- 
ceived her inquiry full in the face. This functionary's 
answer to it, however, had no more than the usual aus- 
terity.  ' Mr. Vanderbank and Mr. Longdon." 

These visitors took a minute to appear, and Mrs. Brook, 
not stirring— still only looking, from the sofa, calmly up 
at Mr. Oashmore — used the time, it might have seemed, 
for correcting any impression of undue levity made by 
her recent question. " Where did you last meet Nanda ?" 

He glanced at the door to see if he were heard. " At 
the Grendons'." 

" So you do go there ?" 

"I went over from Hicks the other day for an hour." 

 '' And Carrie was there ?" 




  

" Yes. It was a dreadful horrid bore. But I talked 
only to your daughter." 

She got up— the others were at hand, and she offered 
Mr. Cashmore a face that might have struck him as 
strange. "It s serious." 

'' Serious ?" — he had no eyes for the others. 

" She didn't tell me." 

He gave a sound, controlled by discretion, which suf- 
ficed, none the less, to make Mr. Longdon — beholding 
him for the first time — receive it with a little of the stiff- 
ness of a person greeted with a guffaw. Mr. Cashmore 
visibly liked this silence of Nanda's about their meeting. 



XIV 

Mrs. Brookenham, who had introduced him to the el- 
der of her visitors, had also found, in serving these gen- 
tlemen with tea, a chance to edge at him with an intensity 
not to be resisted :  '  Talk to Mr. Longdon — take him off 
there J' She had indicated the sofa at the opposite end 
of the room, and had set him an example by possessing 
herself, in the place she already occupied, of her  '  adored" 
Vanderbank. This arrangement, however, when she had 
made it, constituted for her, in her own corner, the 
ground of an instant appeal. "Will he hate me any 
worse for doing that ?" 

Vanderbank glanced at the others.  ''Will Cashmore, 
do you mean ?" 

'  Dear no — I don't care whom he hates. But with Mr. 
Longdon I want to avoid mistakes." 

" Then don't try quite so hard !" Vanderbank laughed. 
" Is that your reason for throwing him into Cashmore's 
arms ?" 



"Yes, precisely — so that I shall have these few mo- 
ments to ask you for directions : you must know him, by 





 

this time, so well. I only want. Heaven help me, to be as 
nice to him as I possibly can."' 

'  That's quite the best thing for you and altogether 
why, this afternoon, I brought him : he might have bet- 
ter luck in finding you — it was he who suggested it — 
than he has had by himself. I'm in a general way," Van- 
derbank added, '' watching over him." 

''I see — and he's watching over you." Mrs. Brook's 
lovely vacancy had already taken in so much.  '' He wants 
to judge of what I may be doing to you — he wants to save 
you from me. He quite detests me." 

Vanderbank, with the interest as well as the amuse- 
ment, fairly threw himself back.  'There's nobody like 
you — you're too magnificent I" 

''I am; and that I can look the truth in the face and 
not be angry or silly about it is, as you know, the one 
thing in the world for which I think a bit well of myself." 

 '  Oh yes, I know— I know ; you're too wonderful !" 

Mrs. Brookenham, in a brief pause, completed her con- 
sciousness.  'They're doing beautifully — he's taking 
Cashmore with a seriousness !" 

''And with what is Cashmore taking him ?" 

"With the hope that, from one moment to another, 
Nanda may come in." 

 '' But how on earth does that concern him ?" 

''Through an extraordinary fancy he has suddenly 
taken to her." Mrs. Brook had been swift to master the 
facts. " He has been meeting her at Tishy's, and she has 
talked to him so effectually about his behavior that she 
has quite made him cease to think about Carrie. He 
prefers her now — and of course she's much nicer." 

Vanderbank's attention, it was clear, had now been 
fully seized. " She's much nicer. Rather ! What you 
mean is," he asked the next moment, "that Nanda, this 
afternoon, has been the object of his call ?" 

  Yes — really; though he tried to keep it from me. 

  

She makes him feel," she went on, ' so innocent and 
good/
