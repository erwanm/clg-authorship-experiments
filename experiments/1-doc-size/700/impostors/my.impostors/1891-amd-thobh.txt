delicately, with no rudeness. Miss Hilliard has her gift, 
and it does help her' to a definite standing in the world. 
It is a purpose. And she has no gift, oh, bitter, burning 
thought! Yes, there is her beauty and grace, but she has 
no longing to become purely a society woman, and what 
else can she do with it ? Even Cynthia has a truer concep- 
tion of worthy living than she with her strenuous endeavors. 
She does not at that instant realize that youth does not 
comprise all the wisdom of the ages, all the experience of 
the wise. 

They spend the next morning planning their removal. 

"Though what Perdita will do alone in that great house 
I can't imagine," sighs Mrs. Halford. "And she knows 





nothing about housekeeping. She should have had a year's 
training, foolish child." 

" You don't imagine for a moment they will remain ? " 
cries Cynthia energetically. " They will flit like wild bees, 
ta.sting the sweets of hotels, theatres, operas, and all man- 
ner of pleasures. Jasper has been rather bored and restless 
of late, and Mr. Bradley has recovered his health, though I 
do not believe Tie would want to go galloping round the 
world. It is almost a pity for Jasper to have the place. 
He really seems too small to fill it." 

She thinks of Winterburne with his potent personality. 

Regina thinks of him also. He will be over this after- 
noon, and she does not desire to see him ; indeed, every fibre 
of her being is in desperate protest. She has known all 
along that she was no favorite with Miss Hilliard, and yet 
that senseless, foolish, impertinent attack will rouse her 
sympathetic womanhood. She hates to think of it being 
told over to him, of all men. He will show his appreeiar 
tion of her so decisively, and she does not want even the 
praise of his eyes, since his estimate of her would be based 
on false premises. She is too sincere to accept the homage, 
and she is not ready for the more subtle distinction that 
always clouds the atmosphere about him for her. 

Immediately after luncheon she leaves them, charging 
Cynthia to look after their mother, and if she is not home 
by nine they are not to expect her: she will spend the 
night with Mrs. Say re. 

" Oh ! " cries Cynthia disappointedly. " And there's sure 
to be some one in." She will not mention names. 

" You must do the lionors then. The time is so short, 
you see," with an air of importance that allows nb demur. 

"But do come back. There is no sense in your staying." 

" Mrs. Say re will want to hear of the event at first hand," 
Kegina replies with a delicate emphasis. 

The hotel hack is going down and she takes her place in 
it, since now it is for the convenience of passengers coming 
back, and she will not he subjected to curious eyes. There 
is a somewhat gruff, elderly man and a foolishly indul- 



 

gent mother of three children. Both parties rather divert 
her. 

It is a fine day early in September, but vegetation of 
all kinds has kept fresh and lovely from heavy dews and 
occasional rains. Here and there a maple hangs out a soli- 
tary twig of red leaves. The gardens are bright with a 
profusion of imperious autumnal flowers that hold up their 
heads like marching regiments. The bird songs are not so 
jubilant as those of June, and the insects prolong their 
notes in a wavering manner that is almost pathetic. 

Eegina finds that the tenant has gone out of the cottage, 
and two men are there making some repairs. She looks up 
a woman to come in and do the cleaning — the household 
matters gravitate naturally to her. Then she strolls up the 
hill, busy with a tangle of thoughts that surprises her. For 
all of life appears changed to her. The future has an in- 
scrutable cloud hovering about its most familiar aspects. 
Not two years since she came here with such high resolves, 
with a vital force that seemed ready to take hold of the 
highest purposes. She has educated herself up to an impos- 
sible standard, yes, she has disdained the common round. 
Oh, what is the meaning of all this unrest ? The unhesi- 
tating belief in the possibility of many things has merged 
into a kind of cynical enlightenment. She has been com- 
pelled to recede from the hasty generalizations that she has 
taken for truth, and feels stranded on a strange shore. 

Mr. Bradley is sitting on the porch in the afternoon sun- 
shine. He is like a picture with his thin, clear-cut face 
that would be at once pronounced aristocratic, his fine white 
skin where the wrinkles seem to lie delicately instead of 
taking the triumphant clutch of coming age. His silvery 
hair, his sloping shoulders, his white hands with their long 
nails, have such a gentlemanly aspect that you can hardly 
imagine him as being of any real service to the world, 
except for adornment. 

" Ah," he says with a nod, rubbing the thin hands cau- 
tiously, " I thought you would come. Did my boy surprise 
you beyond measure ? " and he gives a weak little laugh 





verging on insolence. " I could imagine the scene when he 
walked in with the youngest of you all on his arm. You 
girls do not appear to be in tremendous demand" — 

" There was no scene/' interrupts Kegina. " Mother felt 
hurt, as was natural, at the lack of confidence and respect. 
r)ut we supposed it would end that way presently." 

" No — did you really ? Why, I thought once it would 
be you. But you are rather too high, too grand. A man 
don't want such an overwhelming sort of wife. I don't 
believe you are the kind to marry. And your sister had 
better take that long-headed chap over yonder," nodding 
his head down the river. "Though I doubt if he will 
always come out on top ! " and he gives another rather 
shrill, unmeaning laugh. 

Regina's face flushes with indignation. It almost seems 
as if Mr. Bradley must have been drinking. His eyes 
have a shifty, exultant light, as if he gloated over some- 
thing. Surely marrying Perdita cannot have proved such a 
great victory when there was no real opposition. 

" Your son told you that we were making preparations to 
go in town ? " she questions coldly. 

"Yes." He nods and laughs again unpleasantly. "I 
shall miss your mother. I like your mother very much. 
Well, I like you all. We have had a pleasant summer 
together, but winter comes to every season, to life, to all 
things. It is best that you should go, of course. You 
came first, but you had no real right." 

" We never pretended to have the sole right to Bradley 
House," Regina says in a somewhat contemptuous tone. 
"You have decided then to keep it" — 

" My dear youug woman, there has been no question of 
keeping it that I know of. It always belonged to us, to 
me; I was born here. Circumstances " — and he pauses, 
looks terrified, and seems to shrink into himself. 

" Jasper will return here ? " 

" Why, where else would he go ? " irritably. " He can- 
not leave me alone for more than a few days. My health 
is not sood. Of course he will come back. He and PerJila 



 

can amuse themselyes fiddling and dancing if they like. 
Good heavens ! You should have seen her dance before 
she grew too stout. That put an end to it only in character 
pieces. What was I saying ? " his eyes full of alarm. 
"I was dreaming. I used to be fond enough of theatres 
when I was a young man. Jasper hated them aftei 
a while." 

Eegina walks across the porch, and raises the old-time 
lion's-head knocker. 

"Have yon come back to stay?" he asks, rising and 
turning his eyes sharply upon her. 

" I have not." Miss Halford is incensed. 

" But I want you to," he declares fretfully. " It's very 
lonesome without Jasper. Your mother and you, and — 
and Cynthia. When will you come? Come to-morrow, 
and stay until he returns. Have you any idea why he 
married that little brown thing ? She isn't pretty " — 

Martha opens the door. She only returned yesterday, 
and is surprised at the turn affairs have taken. 

"And you mean to leave such a child as Miss Perdita 
alone with them two men, and one on 'em half crazy ! ' ' 
she exclaims. " I'd as soon put her in the lion's den, au' 
be done with it ! Whatever possessed her to qo off and 
get married that way ? He's charmed her in my opinion, 
an' you ought all of yon to kept a better lookout. What 
does make you go way just at this time ? " 

Eegina explains that it is no new thought, that "Mr. 
Bradley will become the absolute owner of the house, and 
there will be a new master and new mistress, and it will be 
much more prudent for them to be quite away. Mrs. Crouse 
will look after Mrs. Jasper's comfort." 

"Well, I'd never leave her here, never!" is Martha's 
asseveration. 

 " You would have to leave her with her husband : " and 
.Eegina gives a dry, unmirthful smile. "It would be un- 
lawful to separate them." 

"Whatever possessed that child, Heaven only knows. 
He must have done it along of his violin. She was just 





like a charmed ereetur when he played, and them brown 
eyes of hern would grow bigger and wider, and she'd 
follow him round. Yes, depend upon it, the music did the 
business. Lord ! I've heard him make his fiddle cry real 
tears, I know." 

£egina goes through the rooms that Martha has been 
putting in very tolerable order. Some stores are to be 
sent up. 

" And we may come to-morrow," says the young lady. 

" To-morrow ! That's Friday. O Miss Eegina, don't ! 
I wouldn't take a journey or come into a house on Friday, 
for there'd be nothing but bad luck ; " and Martha's tone 
is imploring. 

Eegina smiles at the superstition, but she has a respect 
for the woman's feelings, a certain forethought also of 
having dismal verifications later on, that will not be cheer- 
ful to listen to, and impossible to combat. 

" Very well. Our week doesn't end until Saturday, and 
I suppose we will need to-morrow to pack. Then on the 
very first of the following week, we shall make ready to 
go to the new house. I have no idea when Jasper means 
to return." 

They have adopted his Christian name to avoid confu- 
sion, and partly on his own insistence ; but Eegina is glad 
of an excuse to go back to the more formal order. There 
is a curious fear in her soul already concerning Perdita. 
It is not any bodily harm she apprehends, but an intangi- 
ble premonition of coming unhappiness. For if Jasper 
cared at all for her, then he married Perdita from pique. 
The deeper significance is whether he is capable of a 
generous, tender love. 

She gets matters settled with Martha, and then goes her 
way. On the porch Mr. Bradley stops her again, and begs 
that they will come as soon as possible. He cannot be left 
alone. They surely will not disappoint him ? 

He appears nervously in earnest, and his voice is trem- 
ulous. Eegina has never settled upon any definite estimate 
of his character, but she has not been able to cnr'iillv 



 

admire him. Sometimes he has awakened a peculiar pity- 
ing interest, at others an ill-defined distrust. At first his 
violent claim to everything had proved rather trying, but 
of late he has seemed perfectly satisfied. She vifill be 
relieved to shut him out of the coming life — with a good 
many other things. She means to begin quite anew. 

The Sayres are glad to have her for a guest again, 
though all is much changed since she first came up, a tall 
slip of a girl. It seems now as if she must always have 
been a woman. Perdita's marriage is talked over in its best 
aspects, but no one can define any probabilities. 

" I pushed Mr. Bradley early in the week for a decision 
and a settlement," says Mr. Sayre. " There could be but 
one course. He admitted that they meant to keep the 
place. Now he will have to pay out only two shares, and 
I shall see that you have your money." 

" We shall be so glad to have you in town," declares 
Mrs. Sayre with her fond, staid smile. " You know I was 
your first friend in Beverly." 

Altogether Eegina feels she has been of some service, 
that she is not utterly without discrimination. She has 
yielded to various theoretical fancies about Jasper, and she 
understands that a more designing man might make her 
feel that she had trifled with him. The puerile jealousy 
he has displayed does not touch her as keenly as the inso- 
lence. He may seek to amuse Perdita with silly jests of 
her liking for him — she would rather have it Perdita than 
any other woman. 

By some subtile control over herself, she will not allow 
her thoughts to wander to Mount Sardis. They would see 
in their introverted manner just what had occurred, that 
Winterburne in the little cottage sitting-room is curiously 
disappointed and ill at ease. 

"Oh, dear!" exclaims Cynthia the next forenoon, "how 
awfully disappointing you were last evening ! We had a 
reception — we really did, and I hardly knew what to do. 
Mother was like Dickens's poor convict, ' terribly low,' and 
actually cried over thoughts of Mrs. Jasper. I could 





shake Perdita with a good will, the little wretch! I 
couldn't talk a moment to any one, but there were good-bys 
and invitations. Mr. Stafford came over with Miss Hilliard 
— he is persuading her to make an engagement with a 
Philadelphia firm for illustrating some volumes of poems. 
And I can't tell you half of what any one said. I think 
they were really vexed not to find you at home. Mr. 
Winterburne did not know what to do with himself." 

In the afternoon Kegina takes her mother out to make 
a few farewell calls. Miss Nichol and all the world may 
look at her as she sits in the phaeton, driving her pony, 
carrying herself with the serene grace and unmoved dignity 
one associates with the purest birth and highest training. 
Her plain gown shows the faultless perfection of shoulders 
and arms, a command over every muscle ; her hands are 
gloved to perfection, her elegant hat displays the great coil 
of hair, the shell pink of her dainty ears, the luminous 
whiteness of her complexion. She is unconscious of star- 
ing or envious or even curious eyes. Fortunately she meets 
Miss Hilliard on the hotel balcony, so their few moments 
together are for public eyes, and admit of no sentiment. 
She is glad not to run the gantlet of the Nichol end of 
the cottage porch. But she passes Miss Nichol on the 
promenade, and at that instant smiles at some comment of 
her mother's, while the unwonted sweetness of the expres- 
sion transfigures her with new beauty. 

" What a really handsome girl ! " Mr. Stafford says to his 
companion. "I am proud of ever so distant a relation-, 
ship with her. I have been endeavoring to persuade Miss 
Hilliard to bring them both to Philadelphia presently. 
My mother would be delighted to receive them all." 

Miss Nichol is too good a manager to throw away her 
chance here for an instant's petty spite. Self-interest can  
keep her amiable. 

That evening the trunks are packed, and by noon of the 
next day they are at Bradley House. Mr. Bradley's wel- 
come is eifusive. Has he missed his son so much, and is 
he really glad ? 



 

There is a brief note from Jasper, extravagant, incoher- 
ent, and no mention is made of their return. A message 
from Perdita sends love to everybody. Events proceed 
without any break or mishap. Mrs. Halford is quite cer- 
tain it would be cruel to go away before Ferdita's home- 
coming. There is considerable discussion as to what they 
will take, and what in the shape of heirlooms they will 
leave. 

"I have sent for a carpenter to help move that old 
escritoire," announces Mr. Bradley. " I shall have it up in 
my room, but it must be taken apart. Those things are so 
cumbersome. My grandfather had that, and no doubt his 
father before him." 

He and Mrs. Halford have a sentimental talk over old 
furniture, full of reminiscences on his side. 

They all watch the process as Mr. Gedicke and Abram 
make ready to remove it up-stairs. Drawers come out. 
The bottom, somewhat like a chest of drawers, is unscrewed 
from the top, a task of patient endeavor and oiling of the 
screws. Mr. Gedicke pauses to mop his face, and roll his 
shirt-sleeves a little higher. Then he goes at it with 
renewed vigor, and awkwardly catches his chisel in a board 
at the back. 

" Have a care ! have a care ! " cries Mr. Bradley appre- 
hensively. 

The board flares outward. There is a soft swish as 
something slips down. Gedicke gives it a little twist, 
loosening the lower corner. A large flat paper, dusty and 
cobweby, tumbles to the floor. It is tied with a bit of tajie, 
and sealed with a blotch of dull wax partly slivered off. 
The man picks it up, and hands it to Eegina, who has been 
indifferently watching the proceedings. She takes it fas- 
tidiously in her fingers, beats off the dust, turns it over, 
and this meets her eyes. 

" The last will and testament of Silas Bradley, Esq." 

Regina glances up with a frightened expression, as if 
she had seen a ghost. 

" Oh, what is it ? " cries Cynthia in alarm at her pallor. 





" What is the matter ? "• exclaims Mp. Bradley testily, 
coming around as if in vexation, 

Kegiua hands the packet to him without a word. 

" The will ! " with passionate eagerness. " I always 
said there was one ! " he shouts in a quavering voice. 
" Give it to me. I had my uncle's promise that I should 
be his sole heir ! " 

He clutches it as he drops into a chair completely overr 
come. The three women glance at each other in vague, 
unspoken terror, though only Regina instantly realizes 
what this means for them and Norman Winterburne the 
greater loss to him, she thinks. 



 



CHAPTER XVIII 

COMING HOME 

Nature makes some wise provisions. We migbt be envious of the happiness of 
others, if, frequently, we did not despise It. — L. E. L. 

It seems at times to Regina Halford as if she must be 
answerable for the impending change in the family des- 
tinies. She shudders even now and can feel the rough, 
dusty paper between her fingers. That the will has lain 
there securely hidden all this time, dropped down by some 
freak of fate even before Silas Bradley's death, it would 
seem possible. 

The Halfords are in their new home, whither they went 
at once. Mr. Bradley's delight was almost insanity when, 
on the same evening, Mr. Sayre came up and read the will. 
He noted everything deliberately : the narrow tape witli 
which it was fastened and attached by a blotch of sealing- 
wax that was now a dullish brown, brittle and scaled off, 
the yellowness of the paper and its dry texture, before he 
examined the contents. In a roundish school-boy hand the 
body of the will was written — it was Silas Bradley's earlier 
writing, no doubt. Of late years the letters had sharpened 
a little and were irregular, but quite remarkable for a man 
past ninety. Across the top was the same superscription 
as on the outside, then followed : 

" In the Name of God, Amen. 
"I, Silas Bradley, being of sound mind and body, do 
hereby, etc," through all the quaint, legal verbiage, " be- 
queath to my nephew Morton Bradley, the only son of 
my brother Morton deceased, all such property as I may 
die possessed of, to wit, one hundred and seventy acres of 
land and house known as Bradley House in the town of 





Beverly, and any I may acquire hereafter, all personal 
property ; " and then followed an enumeration of bonds, 
stocks and mortgages, furniture, and so on. 

Mr. Sayre read it carefully over to himself, then to his 
audience. Morton Bradley sat in an arm-chair, his face 
shaded by his long, white hand, that looked whiter than 
ever, and gave a series of affirmative sounds indicating 
great satisfaction. Then Mr. Sayre examined the date, 
which was twenty-two years before. It was attested by 
Lawyer David Paulin and signed by two witnesses, both 
old men and both dead. 

" Of course this must be thoroughly investigated and the 
signatures compared, identified," says Mr. Sayre slowly. 
" With your permission, I will take this with me and keep 
it in my safe until to-morrow " — 

Mr. Bradley partially rises, stretches out his hand. 

" It must be offered for probate — it must be proved an 
authentic document," the lawyer says sharply. " The ink 
of all the signatures is, I think, a little different from the 
main body of the will ; but that would not impair it, of 
course. We must have daylight for it. When is your son. 
expected home, Mr. Bradley ? " 

"I — I do not know " — hesitatingly. 

" I think you had better send for him," says the lawyer 
dryly, as he studies the half-invalid man whose mind cer- 
tainly has not been in a healthy state. One could hardly 
suspect him of trickery. But Mr. Sayre cannot help some 
vague suspicion — perhaps it is because he hates to have 
so great a change in affairs, and because he has come to 
like Jasper Bradley the least of any of the heirs. He 
knows at once if this is established, the others must give 
up everything, but he does not suggest it now. Cynthia 
studies him out of her long, slow inoving eyes. Regina is 
deadly pale. If only she had not been there at the d's- 
eovery ! If she were not so curiously meshed about by the 
other destinies ! 

Mr. Sayre and Mr. Upham go over it very thoroughly 
the next morning. It looks authentic enough, and every- 
body had expected Morton Bradley to be the heir. 



 

" The part of it that seems most singular to me is this," 
says Mr. Upham in a cautious tone of voice. " For twenty 
or so years there was no communication between these 
two men. Kot a letter from his nephew has been found 
among Silas Bradley's effects, bearing any recent date. 
One would imagine during that time he would want to 
make some other disposition of his wealth in case his 
nephew should not be living. And if he expected his 
nephew to come in and take possession, I should suppose 
he would have had the will among his other papers." 

"I hunted that old escritoire through and through. I 
even took up what I fancied was a false bottom. How the 
thing could have slipped away when there wasn't a crevice, 
puzzles me. It has all the marks of age, and the tape 
around it was so tender that it dropped to bits. David 
Paulin's signature can be readily identified. There is Ezra 
McClaymont — he was an old friend — older than Silas 
Bradley, I am quite sure. Part of the woodland up back 
of the hill was purchased from him, as I found by the deed. 
And Joshua Lane " — 

" Lane died over twenty years ago," Mr. Upham declares. 
" I remember settling the estate. Now it is curious that 
Mr. Bradley did not make another will when the lawyer 
and both witnesses were dead. He always struck me as 
being a sensible, reasonable sort of an old man. And he 
couldn't be really certain he would outlive his sister. 
Since she made no will, her part, whatever it was, would go 
to all the heirs, naturally." 

" If she had any separate part." 

"I must get several of Lane's signatures and some of 
McClaymont's and compare them. And I must go down 
to Warwick. This will hit that young Winterburne hard. 
I'm up and down sorry for him." 

Mr. Sayre is deeply interested, and spends his day getting 
together various bits and scraps of information. He 
misses Winterburne, who has gone to a distant town to 
conclude the bargain for a large order. 

At Bradley House there is an unreal sort of atmosphere, 





as if they had all been stunned. Mr. Bradley shows an 
unexpected anxiety for their departure. 'No one has any 
risi;ht in the plaoe, never has had, he declares in an authori- 
tative manner. Regina hastens the packing ; they will 
t;ike none of the articles that have been set aside for them. 
And have not the rest been purchased with the Bradley 
money ? 

On the morning of the second day after the cataclysm 
they take their household belongings, Dolly and the phae- 
ton, and, with a brief, indifferent farewell, wind slowly 
down the well-kept drive. Mrs. Hardin comes to her gar- 
den gate to exchange a few words with Cynthia. 

" I'm awful sorry," she says sympathetically. " That 
old man's half crazy, and there's no sense in his having all 
the money. Lucky that your sister married the young 
man : there'll be some of it in the family." 

" I really wouldn't believe," Mrs. Halford comments, as 
she and Regina drive along the beautiful ways, " I really 
wouldn't believe Cousin Bradley could be so selfish and — 
mean, that is just the word. He fairly gloats over the 
discovery, and is so confident, so arrogant ! I always con- 
sidered him a gentleman, but he has behaved shamefully. 
Do you suppose they will take back everything, Regina ? " 

" If they have the right," she says with bitter emphasis. 
She remembers the apothegm that great poverty and great 
wealth bring to the surface heroic virtues and contempti- 
ble weaknesses. Morton Bradley has displayed a great 
deal of the latter during the forty-eight hours. Surely 
some unseen power must have directed her in this step, yet 
she feels so strange and confused that she can hardly de- 
fine any guiding sensation. It is being utterly at sea. 

" Mr. Winterburne will stand up for his rights,'' says the 
elder lady with intense satisfaction. 

" If the will is proved, no one else has any rights." 

" I do'h't think it ought to be proved. I don't believe 
Uncle Silas meant it to stand. He wouldn't have hidden 
it away in that eld escritoire. And to be hurried out of 
the house in that indecent fashion ! I couldn't have done 
it if I'd had millions." 



 

Eegina and Cytithia bestir themselves, and by night the 
new home takes on a certain friendly aspect. It has a 
sense of neighborliness. The street is wide, and the 
houses opposite cheerful looking, especially when the 
lamps are lighted. One of their neighbors they have 
known quite well, and both have proffered kindly services. 
There is a pleasant stir of people going to and fro, and 
already they have had some tender sympathy from friends 
who all agree that the thing is unprecedented, and that 
some flaw will be found to restore matters to their proper 
equilibrium. The .excitement has not been a bad thing, 
and their indignation at Mr. Bradley's cavalier treatment 
has bridged over what might have been a sentiment of 
regret at leaviiig Bradley House. 

There have been property difficulties and will contests at 
Beverly, as in all county towns, but it is the more exciting 
as all parties have been objects of interest from the first, 
and as the previous disposition of the estate has appeared 
efiuitable. Mr. Sayre has written to the son of old Squire 
I'aulin, and visited the existing branches of the Lane fam- 
ilies, questioning them closely as to whether they ever 
lizard any mention of the will. None of them can recall 
a single fact. 

Winterburne comes up to Beverly at once on his return. 
TTe questions Mr. Sayre with lawyer-like acuteness, and 
t ikes in every fact with a resolute look in his eyes that 
indicates a disposition not to submit tamely. 

"After all," he says, "it is not so much the effect it can 
have upon me, though that will be bad enough at this 
]uncture, as the future of Mrs. Halford and her daughters. 
If one could help them out ! " 

"Mrs. Halford has a little money very judiciously in- 
vested. They are not extravagant. I am thankful they 
had decided upon this change, for I regret to say that Mr. 
Bradley's behavior has been anything but friendly. He 
was very much incensed at the beginning, and wanted to 
fontest the whole thing in a high-handed way, claiming 
that he had been defrauded. I confess to a certain admira- 



tion for the young man tliroiigli it all. He has, I am sure, 
some secret power over his father, and he used it kindly, 
judiciously, and restored hini to a more equable frame of 
mind. But I can't help feeling that the money will soon 
slip through the young man's fingers. He is very improvi- 
dent." 

" Fight it as far as you can," advises Winterburne. " It 
will make me a good deal of trouble, but it will not exactly 
be ruin ; " and a light in his face seems to promise a smile, 
yet hardly dawns. 

" You are lucky in your new mine. I heard it lay 
mostly on the Finter ground." 

"Yes, fortunately. There's enough iron to last half a 
lifetime, excellent quality too. Are the Halfords at all 
settled ? " suddenly veering round.
