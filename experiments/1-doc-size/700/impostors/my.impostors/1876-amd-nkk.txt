figure had been half lost in a great easy-chair, suggest 
ively large enough for two. Over opposite, she had sung 

 



 

through, dreamy twilights, sweet low songs, tender, plain 
tive Irymns, that were enough of themselves to draw souls 
to Christ. 

It would be worth one's while to strive for such a 
woman. How invaluable she would be in parish work 
with her ready kindness and homelike graces ! How 
doubly dear by the fireside, when the waves of the trou 
blesome world ran high, the sweet cheer and adaptiveness 
of her temperament soothing, adjusting, bringing bit by 
bit out of the golden treasurj* of the soul, that one might 
not be overwhelmed, or afraid to choose, or, on the other 
hand, stinted in any thing ! 

Yet he was not the sort of man to dream listlessly 
about love. When he felt the august power penetrating 
every pulse with its subtle vitality, when he realized how 
much fuller and more blessed life would be with her at 
his side, he confessed the truth simply to himself, and 
resolved to win her. He did not think much about his 
poverty, since he had youth and health. God would send 
labor and wages in the right time. From her mother she 
must have learned the cares and rewards of such a life, 
the struggles and bits of rare pleasure, the toil and rest, 
the pain and joy following, and lapping over into one 
another like the seasons of the year, and of the going-on 
to riper days, leaving youth behind, yet not growing old, 
and of the kingdom of heaven from within. 

So he went over to Severn Point prepared to ask her, 
expecting to come back a happy man, with a lovely house^ 
hold vision before him, the holy duty of caring for her, 
of smoothing rough ways, of sheltering in his strong 
arms, of ministering to, and of receiving in turn, of 
rounding, satisfying, and slipping into rest and peaca 
together. 

They welcomed him so cordially into their midst ! they 
brought out their olden pleasures, not grown trite with 
repetition. She was changed, in some way, become 





larger and richer, it seemed, with an ease and culture 
that served to make her more beguiling, not better worth 
the winning : that could never be in his thought of her. 

He hardly disturbed himself about Van Alstyne. He 
had taken the man at his true estimate, as he had Daisy 
Endicott. He could see her on all sides, outwardly, and 
judged her with a more generous understanding than a 
narrower-minded man could have done. And he knew 
now how deep and fervent a reality his love was. 

When she came down stairs so fresh and simply sweet, 
her face aglow with the radiance of youth and pleasure, 
propriety was swept away. He forgot the things he had 
dreamed over so often might be quite new to her, and 
took her in his arms with that spontaneous outburst of 
love, capable of making them one indeed, had their 
hearts beat in unison, the caress that would have told 
all without a word. 

He could not decide whether her strange, shy emotion, 
and her evasion of him all the evening, was displeasure, 
or delicacy. He was ready to blame himself with every 
breath ; yet it had been so sweet to hold her there, even 
for that brief moment, that he could hardly regret. 

But he felt there must be an explanation before he left, 
an apology for so disturbing the tranquillity of her girl- 
heart. He waited half-breathlessly, watching her as she 
flitted here and there, and struck by a strange sense of 
loss whenever she was out of his sight. 

The guests began to disperse with cordial good-nights 
and many expressions of enjoyment. Some one was 
going now ; and Daisy ran down to the walk for a last 
word or two. She surely would not be needed for a few 
moments. He picked up her shawl, he knew it by the 
fleecy, pale-blue border, came down, and, folding it 
about her, said quickly, 

" May I detain you, Miss Endicott? " 

The suddenness and certain air of authority took her 





so by surprise, that she had hardly time to start and 
tremble, before he resumed, 

" I want to ask your pardon for my rudeness ear ty in 
the evening. But you must know what it meant, that I 
love you, that I have loved and dreamed about you ever 
since }*ou left Edgerly. The depth and force of my 
feeling swept me over the boundaries of propriety ; but I 
am ready to answer for my daring ' ' 

" Oh! " she interrupted with a sharp, sudden cry, out 
of which the joy had gone. 

He stood still, catching at his own breath, bewildered, 
and quite at sea. Then he turned her round, and studied 
her face with feverish impatience, reading something 
more than mere surprise, terror. 

"Have I spoken too soon? Forgive me. I fancied 
you must know ; for no man of honor could offer such a 
caress to a woman without ' ' 

She saw it all in a blinding flash, the love that lay at 
her feet. Two months ago, she might have answered 
him to his happiness. Why not now? What had come 
between ? 

In the same glare she saw another man. If he stood 
speaking, if his hand were on her arm, there would be 
a consenting tenderness instead of repulsion, a great joy 
instead of trembling pain and regret. Even now her 
cheek burned with shame at the remembrance of the kiss 
wherewith he had expressed his love. An overwhelming 
flood seemed almost to sweep her away from any secure 
mooring. 

"Oh, if you had not spoken! if j*ou would take it 
back forget it ! " she cried in passionate anguish. 

He studied her face of pain and dismay. A brave 
man was Arthur Dudley ; but this was like being swept 
from the spar on which he had meant to float to a prom 
ised haven. There *was nothing else at hand : he had 
trusted the life of his affection to that. Still, if he must 





go down, it should be bravely, not with any cowardly 
clinging to a woman's pity. 

"Then yon do not love me?" His incisive tone 
seemed to cleave the summer air, and let in a waft of 
arctic coldness. 

"I " she covered her face with her hands. It filled 
him with infinite sorrow as she swaj'ed to and fro. " I 
am so sorry ! " in the humblest of tones. " I did not 
mean to mislead any one. Oh ! what have I done? " 

Her distress was so deep and genuine, that he was sin 
cerely moved. 

" My dear child," he said with all the comfort he could 
put in his voice, " it was nothing you did with any pur 
pose. God gave you the lovely graces of womanhood, 
and you have not overlaid them with any false or meretri 
cious ornament. It was my misfortune to see and to 
desire. But I am a man, and not blind, which must be 
my excuse. I see that I have surprised you greatly ; 
but, Daisy, when you come to understand and realize 
how deep and ardent my regard surely is, may you not 
learn ' ' 

" No, no ! do not think of that ! " and she wrung her 
hands with vague apprehension. " Not but what you are 
noble enough for any woman's love, only it would be 
cruel to to hold out a hope that could come to noth 
ing ;" and she shivered as if in a midnight blast. "I 
am so sony ! Oh, let me go back to the house ! They 
will wonder " 

" Tranquillize }*ourself a little ; remember that you will 
always have in me a friend." Yet he paused to wonder 
if he could be friend again. He led her back to the 
house, and lingered outside while she mounted the steps 
wearily, his heart aching to assist her with his strong, 
fond clasp ; but his delicacy assuring him that she would 
rather enter alone. "* 

If he had spoken before they came to Severn Point, 



 

would it have been any better? She certainly had liked 
him then, given him a shy, pleased preference. He felt 
bewildered, pained, incredulous. There must be some 
mistake, surety. He would watch her to-morrow, and for 
daj-s to come ; and if he saw a sign of relenting, such as 
she must make if she felt she had been over-hast}", he 
would speak again. He possessed a rare quality of both 
patience and hope. 

The guests had all dispersed when he went in. Mrs. 
Glyndon.and Mrs. Kinnard were talking the evening 
over, after the manner of women. Pie said a quiet good 
night, and then, as if bethinking himself, left one for 
Miss Endicott. 

They were all tired, and glad to go to bed. Once in 
her own room, Daisy closed the door, and looked 
around in wild affright, as if she was always to be haunted 
by some distrustful phantom. She shrank from it with 
pain and dread. There came a piteous look into her 
eyes, a quivering about the tender mouth. Even now 
she could give it no name ; but she felt what might have 
been the blissful perfection that could have rounded her 
life, but, instead, had left it flawed, roughened, scathed 
as if by lightning. With a sad prescience that had in it 
none of the delightful suggestions of hope, she looked 
into the dreary future, a long life, perhaps, shorn of its 
keenest joy. And she could have worshipped so wholly ! 

After a restless night, she woke, at last, with a severe 
headache. Breakfast was late. There were no rigid 
rules in the household on this subject. Dr. Kinnard had 
taken Bertie out to ride before she came down. 

" You do look really fagged out ! " cried Mrs. Glyndon. 
"And you were so bright and fresh yesterday! I am 
glad of that, for obviously selfish reasons. Never mind : 
after the feast, crumbs, of course. Let me give }*ou a cup 
of tea, and then you. had better go back to bed. There is 
the rowing to Golden Rock this afternoon, you know." 





She should not go, she had resolved upon that; but 
she was extremely glad of a reasonable excuse for soli 
tude. Dr. Kinnard teased her a little at noon, but 
desisted, when he saw that it really pained her. 

" You had better stay at home, and be quiet," he said 
kindly. " You have had so many pleasures, that it will 
be no great trial to relinquish this." 

"No," she answered with a tremulous smile, glad to 
be left with no further comment. For Arthur Dudley 
was to be of the rowing-party, oarsman, in fact ; and she 
could not meet him just yet. 

She lay on the sofa the whole long afternoon, in a 
mood of the most painful and bewildering uncertainty, 
revolving the endless tangle, and wondering what could 
be the conclusion, dreading it with great pangs of appre 
hension. 

Just at dusk, the bell rang. She had been in a half- 
doze, and did not catch the inquiry, but heard the last of 
Susan's answer, "and Miss Endicott is in bed, I be 
lieve, with a bad headache. Shall I speak to her? " 

"No; don't disturb her. I will drop in to-morrow. 
Partings are the order of the day now ; and I shall be off 
in a day or two. Give them all my compliments." 

A great pang of agony and pain surged over Daisy 
Endicott. She buried her face in the pillow, her shrink 
ing, crimson face, into which the sound of that voice 
brought the blazing light of her secret. How had she come 
to love him (for it was that : she could not conceal it from 
herself), and there had never been any hope, from the 
first? Ah, she had not selfishly thought of that. It had 
been so delightful! the low tones, the changeful and 
tender lights in the eyes (false lights to lure the unwary) , 
the bits and fragments of sentences meant for her alone. 
And last evening why, it seemed as if he had almost 
said ah, almost, he had never meant to say it quite. 
And she had not thought there could be danger. 




To-day he had come and gone, not caring to see her ; 
and in a day or two he would go forever. Oh ! how could 
she endure that bitter parting, the awful sense of loss ? 
If she could see him occasionally, if there could still be 
some delightful hours of friendship. She would not ask 
any greater love. She had not sufficient charm to fill the 
whole life of such a man. If she had been made beautiful 
as Nelly ; for he had been very strongly attracted toward 
her, that she had seen. 

But her plain, modest life had in it no bewildering 
grace, either to gain such a prize, or to comfort in this 
hour of bitter loss and self-abasement. Some women 
would have fought fiercely with fate : she only accepted 
despair. The desolation must come upon her, must be 
borne. She was none the less Daisy Endicott. She had 
sisterly, daughterly, and friendly ties and duties in this 
world, and they must be met bravely. She could not 
confess to any one how she had been met and vanquished 
in the very outset of life ; perhaps weakly, for she had 
been warned. 

She rose, then, bathed her face, brushed out her soft, 
shining hair, put on a white dress and bit of cherry ribbon. 
Outwardly she was to be the same to every one. Then 
the family returned, and she went down, glad to have 
something to do, to take up her burthen right away. 

Arthur Dudley had been a trifle grave all the afternoon, 
though the short excursion proved a decided success. 
But he declined their friendly solicitations to come home 
and take a cup of tea. 

" I am absolutely going to bed with the chickens," he 
declared gayly. " I hope j-ou will find Miss Endicott 
better. To-morrow I shall give myself the pleasure of 
your hospitality, Mrs. Glyndon. Bertie, don't you be 
lieve you could take me out driving ? ' ' 

" Oh ! couldn't I, papa? " exclaimed the^ child eagerly 
" Mamma lets me drive." 

 

" I think so." 

Bertie came home, elated with his project. After a 
quiet meal, there was a little talking of the coming dis 
persion. . 

" I must go back on Tuescla}*, at the latest," said Dr. 
Kinnard. " Can you get all packed up on Monday, 
Nelly?" 

" Oh, yes ! " was the ready reply. 

" Then we have two more days to devote to pleasure, 
Sunday to rest " 

" And Monday to a general disturbance of the spheres," 
interrupted Mrs. Glyndon merrily. " Well, we have had 
a bright, pleasant summer. Mrs. Kinnard has gone back 
to the enchantment of eighteen. Bertie has entirely 
recovered; don't you think so, doctor? Daisj^ seems to 
have had a young girl's good time ; and I have been 
happy as a queen. We have lived together eleven weeks 
without quarrelling what do }*ou say to that for women's 
tempers? " 

" Pretty good ; pretty good ! " and the doctor laughed. 

Two more days of pleasure ! It rang in Daisy's ears 
like the saddest knell. 

Mr. Dudley came over the next morning, and went out 
with Bertie. Then Mrs. Glyndon kept him to dinner. 
Two ladies had dropped in also. Daisy's avoidance of 
him was not marked : he made it very easy for her. 

Then, late in the afternoon, Van Alst'ne made his 
appearance, with his usual jaunty, elegant ease. JHe 
made quite sure that the ladies were all at home ; for he- 
did not mean to risk any special rencounter with Daisy. 
Such partings were awkward things. 

He had decided to go to Maine for a month, with a 
hunting-party, and was to leave to-morrow. 

" I wonder if you will be in New York in the winter, 
Mrs. Gl'ndon. One does have a chance to see you occa 
sionally. And it may be that I shall stumble over you 





all, somewhere, again : I shall hope so, at all events. 
We have had such a delightful summer ! " 

He shook hands cordially with them all. Daisy's white 
fingers were cold and inert. He did not care to look into 
her eyes : the lids were downcast and tremulous. But he 
uttered the commonplaces of society over her with his 
serene and careless air ; and they were separated for all 
time. 

" I am afraid the little Endicott has been hit," he 
mused. " It wouldn't have done to go on for a day 
longer. However, I daresay Dudley will make it all 
right with her some day. By Jove ! she's just cut out for 
a minister's wife ; and she is a good little girl too. I'm 
glad I never did any thing more than kiss her hand. 
Van, my boy, you have withstood a good deal of tempta 
tion." 

Saturday was marked by other partings. Sunday was 
lovely and tranquil, a perfect da)' of rest, a golden life 
and glory in it, as if summer's richness just stood still, 
and ripened. Mr. Dudley took the service in the church ; 
and Daisy listened to his voice with a peculiar tender 
reverence, as if, having once hurt him so sorely, she must 
make it up to herself with another kind of worship. 

Then the packing, and the journey home, the mother 
welcome that had been promised Nelly, a little awk 
ward, with a sense of being unfamiliar, but pleasant in 
not saying or doing too much. 

"And look at me, grandmamma! I am alt well. I 
can run and jump ; and I've had a first-rate time. I've 
learned to drive ; and I am going to take you out some 
day. Mamma says I can have her pony." 

All this with his arms around his grandmother's neck, 
where they had rarely been before. 

" Why, Barton, how well he looks ! And, I declare, he 
has grown quite pretty ; something as you used to look." 
And she held him off to study him. 





"Yes," said the doctor humorously: "my handsome 
days were in childhood, I believe." 

They would fain have kept Daisy ; but she wanted to 
get home, and shut out all reminders of the summer. So 
the doctor took her over, and brought back saucy Queen 
Bess, who was tall and straight, and full of rippling, 
girlish beauty. Bertie was puzzled to decide which he 
liked the better. Bessie was so bright and funnj^. 

" If only there were no Aunt Adelaide to come in like 
a dismal gray shadow ! " thought Mistress Nelly Kinnard. 






CHAPTER XX. 

But on the fire burns, clear and still ; 

The cankering sorrow dies ; 
The small wounds heal; the clouds are rent; 
And through this shattered mortal tent 

Shine down the eternal skies. 

A CHANGE had surely come over Mother Kinnard ; that 
Nelly saw presently. 

She had been upheld in such a rigid way between Jane 
and Aunt Adelaide ! We borrow more easily some influ 
ence or manner of our neighbor than we are willing to 
believe ; and household frettings are so readily taken up : 
coldnesses and unkindnesses are grafts that flourish 
rapidly in a congenial soil. If we do not plant grain, 
weeds surely will grow : we see that all over. No inch 
of ground, no human soul, is utterly barren. 

She seemed to have grown older too. There were 
more wrinkles in her face, a little softness and quivering 
in her voice, a sort of uncertain air now and then, as if 
she was trying to remember what came next. 

She admitted to having been lonesome while the doctor 
was away ; but, for the rest, she had not enjoyed any 
thing so much since her own housekeeping days. Mary 
was such a treasure! "And I hope you'll find every 
thing as you like it. I have tried to keep the house well 
aired and in order." 

" It looks very bright and fresh, I am sure," was 
Nelty's reply. 

And now came disastrous tidings. With some blush- 

 

ing hesitation, Mary announced to her mistress that she 
should be compelled to leave, as she was about to be 
married. 

"I've been very well satisfied, ma'am, and I hate to 
leave you and the doctor. I never thought I should get 
along so well with everybody. But you see, ma'am, 
this is an old affair with Henry. When we were both 
young, I was the older by two years, he took a great 
fancy about me. I couldn't have married him then, any 
how. Mr. Berkman was just beginning to come, and I 
liked him ; and Henry seemed so very young at twentj r . 
Well, his mother, she had word of it ; and she made a 
terrible time. There was a farm that she had her rights 
in ; and she was a very unreasonable woman, high- 
tempered, and all that : so she declared Henry should 
never bring home a wife ; and he couldn't go away, 
because there was no one else to till the farm. It didn't 
make any difference to me, you see ; and yet I felt very 
sorry for him. bo she just grew queerer and crosser, and, 
finally, wouldn't let any but very old women come into 
the house. He was a good son to her, better than many 
a man, I'm thinking. Well, last May she died. Henry 
came to see me soon after you had gone away. It was 
a kind of first love, you see ; what with his mother being 
so cranky, it had never been quite taken out of his mind. 
He's a good, clever, steady man ; has a nice farm; and 
the old lady was a master hand to save, and make bed 
ding. The house is full of furniture, and he's fond of 
little Katy. I'm sure I hope we'll have some children 
of our own : it would be such a joy to him. So I think, 
ma'am, it's too good to let slip, since I do like him very 
much, and can make him happ}*." 

Mary looked up blushingly at the end of her con 
fession. 

u I caunot blame you," rejoined Nelly, " though I am 
very sorry to lose you ; and I hope you will be happy. 





At all events, Henry will get a good wife. When will 
you want to leave? " 

"Just as soon as you can spare me, ma'am. I told 
him I wouldn't be later than the first of October." 

Nelly gave a sigh. 

" If it wasn't for this, I'd staj r always with you," said 
the faithful creature. " And if the farm wasn't so far 
it's about a mile the other side of Kelly's Falls." 

"And you will have your hands full," said Mrs. Kinnard 
with a smile, that she had some ado to make cheerful. 

"I supposed as much," was the doctor's comment, 
when he heard it. " Henry Kline has been coming 
steadily all summer. Well, it's tne way of the world. 
I set a bad example myself: so I cannot complain." 
And he smiled humorously. 

Aunt Adelaide would be home the last of the month : 
she trusted all danger of the fever would be over, as she 
could not think of exposing Maud to it. Bertie recom 
menced school, though his father exercised a careful 
supervision over him. The fall cleaning and changes 
were attended to ; the flowers put in train for winter 
blooming ; and Nelly was as busy as a bee. Bess was 
bright and helpful, and a great comfort. 

And then fell upon Nelly the first real sorrow of her 
life, so far. Rose's baby, that almost marvellous embodi 
ment of infantile grace, beauty, and sweetness, sickened 
and died. Its short week of illness had not prepared any 
one for the loss : it did not seem, indeed, as if he could 
die. So Nelly went to her for a few days. 

A month before, Mrs. Whitcomb had gone to Europe 
with a dear invalid friend. Rose and Stephen had given 
a rather sad but not unwilling assent. Surely Mrs. Whit- 
comb had earned this pleasure. 

Daisy was to remain, and help her bear the pain and 
anguish. The first death in their little circle, the loveli 
est flower of all. Dr. Kinnard was profoundly stirred. 




" I really believe I have coveted that baby, Nelly," he 
said in a tone of deep emotion that thrilled her strangely. 

But she had to return home. Here was Aunt Adelakb 
and Maud, the first severely consequential ; the latter, a 
good deal improved, but with many airs of fine ladyism. 
Nelly's heart sank within her. The pleasantness of life 
seemed suddenly dimmed. 

Bertie's sleeping-room had been changed to one at the 
head of the hall, taking him quite out of his aunt's care. 
She treated him with a lofty contempt, and took every 
occasion to snub him. Mother Kinnard's half-defection 
angered her secretly. She was compelled to admit that 
she could no longer be prime mover of the forces. But 
there were many ways to annoy "my brother-in-law's 
second wife," as she usually termed her; and none more 
effective than an almost insulting deference when visitors 
were present, indicating that she was in the house merely 
on sufferance, because related to the children. 

And then began another great perplex! tj^. Mrs. Berk- 
man was married, and went to her new home ; but her 
successor found it "so lonesome of evenings," and 
wanted to go farther in town. There followed a list of 
incapables. The once tidy kitchen was a scene of dis 
order. Meals were irregular and half cooked, unless Nelly 
supervised everything. The ironing dragged around all 
the week. One great brawny Irishwoman found the work 
so hard she couldn't stand it : " she woodent worruk her 
. fingers to the bone for any one, that she woodent ! " 

Jane Ferris heard of it with peculiar delight. Mrs. 
Kinnard's good fortune had been a personal affront to 
her. 

"I said they'd see!" and she tossed her head with 
emphasis. " But I'd never go back for a soul of them, 
save the doctor. I've seen ladies enough in my day to 
tell the genuine article when I do meet with it." 

However, no one asked Jane to come back. Mat was 





almost as good as a girl to Ms young mistress, and very 
helpful. She gave tip her rides, her books, her music, her 
village calling, and tried her best to fight it through. If 
she had only been alone, or if Mother Kinnard had fought 
with her! But that lady held secret sessions with the 
enemy, that were detrimental to a firm faith in her 
daughter-in-law. . 

How hard Nelly Kinnard worked all this time to keep 
her temper, and her pleasant household ways, no one but 
Him who seeth in secret knew. There were days when 
heart and mind and hands were so overtasked, that her 
husband's voice almost failed to charm ; nights when she 
laid her throbbing temples on the pillow, and cried softly, 
so that he might not hear, out of pure weariness and 
discouragement. 

It came to an end just after the holidays, in the person 
of a rather stolid German, who had been well trained, and 
was exceedingly good natured, though rather slow. But 
poor Nelly had not reached any promised land yet. Mrs. 
Kinnard was taken ill with fever and rheumatism ; and, 
from that time until spring, there was nursing and amus 
ing. Yet out of this came an abundant reward. She 
conquered here a lasting peace. Feeble, querulous, and 
oftentimes tiresome ; yet the elder woman learned to love 
and appreciate her son's wife, to give her her due un 
grudgingly. 

Had it not been worth striving for? Two years, and 
two souls brought into her kingdom. Youth and age 
bowing down in simple homage, watching her with longing, 
wistful eyes, bringing her some first-fruit of love, tiying to 
make smooth ways for the often tired feet. 

Bertie paid his mother a chivalrous homage in spite of 
Aunt Adelaide's sneers, and would have thrashed imy boy 
of his size who dared to breathe a suspicion against step 
mothers. Mr. Herrick considered him a promising pupil ; 
and he had become quite a companion to his father. 





Slow of thought in some matters, yet he had a quaint, 
droll quickness in others. He grew fonder of his grand 
mother, too, and was delighted when he was allowed to 
take her out to drive. 

She had broken very much, and was quite an old \acly. 
The rather massive chignon was discarded ; and Nelly used 
to make a pretty coil of braids (for her hair was still 
abundant) , and some becoming finger-puffs brought down 
on the somewhat too high forehead. A dainty little 
square of lace with a bit of purple ribbon, and a soft 
ruche around her neck, quite transformed her. She would 
always be tall, and rather severe looking ; but the dark 
eyes had softened a little, and the voice taken on a gentler 
chord in weakness. 

" I'm sure no daughter ever could be better," she 
would occasionally say to Nelly. ' ' I never thought to be 
beholden to any one ; but you have such a sweet way of 
doing favors, as if it was no trouble. But I know well 
enough a sick old woman is a burthen."
