"How very — amusing!" said Mrs. Vostrand. 
" What a small world it is." With these words she 
fell into a vagary ; her daughter recalled her from it 
with a slight movement. "Breakfast? How impa- 
tient you are, Genevieve I Well ! " She smiled the 
sweetest parting to Whitwell, and suffered herself to 
be led away by Jeff. 

" And you're at Harvard ! I'm so interested. My 
own boy will be going there soon." 

"Well, there's no place like Harvard," said Jeff. 
" I'm in my Sophomore year, now." 

" Oh, a Sophomore ! Fancy ! " cried Mrs. Vostrand, 
as if nothing could give her more pleasure. " My son 
is going to prepare at St. Mark's. Did you prepare 
there ? " 

" No, I prepared at Lovewell Academy, over here." 
Jeff nodded in a southerly direction. 

" Oh, indeed I " said Mrs. Vostrand, as if she knew 
where Lovewell was, and instantly recognized the 
name of the ancient school. 



no THE LANDLOBD AT LION'S HEAD. 

They liad reached the dining-room, and Jefi pushed 
the screen-door open with one hand, and followed the 
ladies in. He had the effect of welcoming them like 
invited guests ; he placed the ladies himself at a win- 
dow, where he said Mrs. Vostrand would be out of the 
draughts, and they could have a good view of Lion's 
Head. He leaned over between them, when they were 
seated, to get sight of the mountain, and " There ! " 
he said; " That cloud's gone at last." Then, as if it 
would be modester in the proprietor of the view to 
leave them to their flattering raptures in it, he moved 
away, and stood talking a moment with Cynthia Whit- 
well near the door of the serving-room. He talked 
gayly, with many tosses of the head and turns about, 
while she listened with a vague smile motionlessly. 

" She's very pretty," said Miss Vostrand to her mo- 
ther. 

"Yes. The New England type," murmured the 
mother. 

" They all have the same look, a good deal," said 
the girl, glancing over the room where the waitresses 
stood ranged against the wall with their hands folded 
at their waists. " They have better faces than figures, 
but she is beautiful every way. Do you suppose they 
are all school-teachers ? They look intellectual. Or 
is it their glasses ? " 

" I don't know," said the mother. " They used to 
be ; but things change here so rapidly, it may all be 
different. Do you like it ? " 

" I think it's charming here," said the younger lady, 
evasively. " Everything is so exquisitely clean. And 



THE LANDLORD AT LION'S HEAD. Ill 

the food is very good. Is this corn-bread — that you've 
told me about so much ? " 

" Yes, this is corn-bread. You will have to get ac- 
customed to it." 

" Perhaps it won't take long. I could fancy that 
girl knowing about everything. Don't you like her 
looks?" 

" Oh, very much ! " Mrs. Vostrand turned for an- 
other glance at Cynthia. 

" What say ? " Their smiling waitress came for- 
ward from the wall where she was leaning, as if she 
thought they had spoken to her. 

" Oh, we were speaking — the young lady to whom 
Mr. Durgin was talking — she is — " 

" She's the housekeeper — Miss Whitwell." 

" Oh, indeed ! She seems so young — " 

" I guess she knows what to do-o-o," the waitress 
chanted. " We think she's about ri-i-ght ! " She 
smiled tolerantly upon the misgiving of the stranger, 
if it was that, and then retreated when the mother and 
daughter began talking together again. 

They had praised the mountain with the cloud ofE, 
to Jeff, very politely, and now the mother said, a little 
more intimately, but still with the deference of a so- 
ciety acquaintance, " He seems very gentlemanly, and 
I am sure he is very kind. I don't quite know what 
to do about it, do you ? " 

" No, I don't. It's all strange to me, you know." 

" Yes, I suppose it must be. But you will get used 
to it if we remain in the country. Do you think you 
will dislike it ? " 



 

" Oh, no ! It's very difierent. " 

"Yes, it's different. He is very handsome, in a 
certain way.'' The daughter said nothing, and the 
mother added, " I wonder if he was trying to conceal 
that he had come second-cabin, and was not going to 
let us know that he crossed with us ? " 

"Do you think he was bound to do so? " 

" No. But it was very odd, his not mentioning it. 
And his going out on a cattle-steamer," the mother 
observed. 

" Oh, but that's very chic, I've heard," the daughter 
replied. " I've heard that the young men like it, and 
think it a great chance. They have great fun. It isn't 
at all like second-cabin." 

" You young people have your own world," the 
mother answered, caressingly. 



XVI. 

Westover met the ladies coming out of the dining- 
room as he went in rather late to breakfast ; he had 
been making a study of Lion's Head in the morning 
light after the cloud lifted from it. He was always 
doing Lion's Heads, it seemed to him ; but he loved 
the mountain and he was always finding something 
new in it. 

He was now seeing it inwardly with so exclusive a 
vision that he had no eyes for these extremely pretty 
women till they were out of sight. Then he remem- 
bered noticing them, and started with a sense of rec- 
ognition, which he verified by the hotel register when 
he had finished his meal. It was in fact Mrs. James 
W. Vostrand, and it was Miss Vostrand, whom West- 
over had known ten years before in Italy. Mrs. Vos- 
trand had then lately come abroad for the education 
of her children, and was pausing in doubt at Florence 
whether she should educate them in Germany or Switz- 
erland. Her husband had apparently abandoned this 
question to her, and he did not contribute his presence 
to her moral support during her struggle with a prob- 
lem which Westover remembered as having a tendency 
H 



 

to solution in the direction of a permanent stay in 
Florence. 

In those days he liked Mrs. Vostrand very much, 
and at twenty he considered her at thirty distinctly 
middle-aged. For one winter she had a friendly little 
salon, which was the most attractive place in Florence 
to him, then a cub painter sufficiently unlicked. He 
was aware of her children being a good deal in the 
salon : a girl of eight who was like her mother, and 
quite a savage little boy of five, who may have been 
like his father. If he was, and the absent Mr. Vos- 
trand had the same habit of sulking and kicking at 
people's shins, Westover could partly understand why 
Mrs. Vostrand had come to Europe for the education 
of her children. It all came vividly back to him, while 
he went about looking for Mrs. Vostrand and her 
daughter on the verandas and in the parlors. But he 
did not find them, and he was going to send his name 
to their rooms when he came upon JefE Durgin figur- 
ing about the office in a fresh London conception of 
an outing costume. 

" You're very swell," said Westover, halting him to 
take full note of it. 

" Like it? "Well, I knew you'd understand what it 
meant. Mother thinks it's a little too rowdy-looking. 
Her idea is black broadcloth frock-coat and doeskin 
trousers, for a gentleman, you know." He laughed 
with a young joyousness ; and then became serious. 
"Couple of ladies here, somewhere, I'd like to intro- 
duce you to. Came over with me from the depot 
last night. Very nice people, and I'd like to make it 




pleasant for them — get up sometliing — go somewhere, 
and when you see their style you can judge what it 
had better be. Mrs. Vostrand and her daughter." 

" Thank you," said Westover. " I think I know 
them already — at least one of them. I used to go to 
Mrs. Vostrand's house in Florence." 

" That so ? Well, fact is, I crossed with them; but 
I came second-cabin, because I'd spent all my money, 
and I didn't get acquainted with them on the ship, 
but we met in the train coming up, last night. Said 
they had heard of Lion's Head on the other side from 
friends. But it was quite a coincidence, don't you 
think ! I'd like to have them see what this neighbor- 
hood really is ; and I wish, Mr. Westover, you'd find 
out, if you can, what they'd like. If they're for walk- 
ing, we could get Whitwell to personally conduct a 
party, and if they're for driving, I'd like to show them 
a little mountain-coaching myself." 

" I don't know whether I'd better not leave the 
whole thing to you, Jeff," Westover said, after a mo- 
ment's reflection. " I don't see exactly how I could 
bring the question into a first interview." 

" Well, perhaps it would be rather rushing it. But 
if I get up something, you'll come, Mr. Westover ? " 

" I will, with great pleasure," said Westover, and 
he went to make his call. 

A half-hour later he was passing the door of the 
old parlor which Mrs. Durgin still kept for hers, on 
his way up to his room, when a sound of angry voices 
came out to him. Then the voice of Mrs. Durgin de- 
fined itself in the words : "I'm not goin' to have to 



 

ask any more folks for their rooms on your account, 
Jeff Durgin — Mr. Westover ! Mr. Westover, is that 
you ? " her voice broke off to call after him as he hur- 
ried by. "Won't you come in here, a minute?" 

He hesitated, and then Jeff called, " Yes, come in, 
Mr. Westover." 

The painter found him sitting on the old hair-cloth 
sofa, with his stick between his hands and knees, con- 
fronting his mother, who was rocking excitedly to and 
fro in the old hair-cloth easy-chair. 

" You know these folks that Jeff's so crazy about ? " 
she demanded. 

" Crazy ! " cried Jeff, laughing and frowning at the 
same time. " What's crazy in wanting to go off on a 
drive, and choose your own party ? " 

" Do you know them ? " Mrs. Durgin repeated to 
Westover. 

"The Vostrands? Why, yes. I knew Mrs. Vos- 
trand in Italy a good many years ago, and I've just 
been calling on her and her daughter, who was a little 
girl, then." 

" What kind of folks are they ? " 
" What kind ? Really ! Why, they're very charm- 
ing people — " 

" So Jeff seems to think. Any call to show them 
any particular attention ? " 

" I don't know if I quite understand — " 

" Why, it's just this. Jeff, here, wants to make a 

picnic for them, or something, and I can't see the 

sense of it. You remember what happened at that 

other picnic, with that Mrs. Marven " — Jeff tapped the 




floor with his stick, impatiently, and Westover felt 
sorry for him — " and I don't want it to happen again, 
and I've told Jeff so. I presume he thinks it'll set 
him right with them, if they're thinkin' demeaning of 
him because he came over second-cabin on their ship." 

Jeff set his teeth and compressed his lips to bear as 
best he could the give-away which his mother could 
not appreciate in its importance to him. 

"They're not the kind of people to take such a 
thing shabbily," said Westover. " They didn't happen 
to mention it, but Mrs. Vostrand must have got used 
to seeing young fellows in straits of all kinds during 
her life abroad. I know that I sometimes made the 
cup of tea and biscuit she used to give me in Florence 
do duty for a dinner, and I believe she knew it." 

Jeff looked up at Westover with a grateful, side- 
long glance. 

His mother said, " Well, then, that's all right, and 
Jeff needn't do anything for them on that account. 
And I've made up my mind about one thing : whatever 
the hotel does has got to be done for the whole hotel. 
It can't pick and choose amongst the guests." West- 
over liked so little the part of old family friend which 
he seemed, whether he liked it or not, to bear with 
the Durgins, that he would gladly have got away now, 
but Mrs. Durgin detained him with a direct appeal. 
" Don't you think so, Mr. Westover ? " 

Jeff spared him the pain of a response. "Very 
well," he said to his mother, " I'm not the hotel, and 
you never want me to be. I can do this on my own 
account." 



 

" Not with my coach and not with my hosses," said 
his mother. 

Jeff rose. " I might as well go on down to Cam- 
bridge, and get to work on my conditions." 

" Just as you please about that," said Mrs. Durgin, 
with the same impassioned quiet that showed in her 
son's handsome face and made it one angry red to his 
yellow hair. " We've got along without you so far, 
this summer, and I guess we can the rest of the time. 
And the sooner you work ofE your conditions the 
better, I presume." 

The next morning Jeff came to take leave of him, 
where Westover had pitched his easel and camp-stool 
on the slope behind the hotel. 

" Why, are you really going ? " he asked. " I was 
in hopes it might have blown over." 

" No, things don't blow over so easy with mother," 
said Jeff, with an embarrassed laugh, but no resent- 
ment. " She generally means what she says." 

" Well, in this case, Jeff, I think she was right." 

" Oh, I guess so," said Jeff, pulling up a long blade 
of grass, and taking it between his teeth. " Anyway, 
it comes to the same thing as far as I'm concerned. 
It's for her to say what shall be done and what sha'n't 
be done in her own house, even if it is a hotel. That's 
what I shall do in mine. We're used to these little 
differences ; but we talk it out, and that's the end of 
it. I shouldn't really go, though, if I didn't think I 
ought to get in some work on those conditions before 
the thing begins regularly. I should have liked to 
help here a little, for I've had a good time and I ought 



 

to be willing to pay for it. But she's in good hands. 
Jackson's well — for him — and she's got Cynthia." 

The easy security of tone with which JefE pronounced 
the name vexed Westover. " I suppose your mother 
would hardly know how to do without her, even if you 
were at home," he said, dryly. 

" Well, that's a fact," Jefi assented, with a laugh 
for the hit. " And Jackson thinks the world of her. 
I believe he trusts her judgment more than he does 
mother's about the hotel. Well, I must be going. 
You don't know where Mrs. Vostrand is going to be 
this winter, I suppose ? " 

" No, I don't," said Westover. He could not help 
a sort of blind resentment in the situation. If he 
could not feel that Jeff was the best that could be for 
Cynthia, he had certainly no reason to regret that his 
thoughts could be so lightly turned from her. But 
the fact anomalously incensed him as a slight to the 
girl, who might have been still more sacrificed by 
JeS's constancy. He forced himself to add, " I fancy 
Mrs. Vostrand doesn't know herself." 

" I wish I didn't know where I  was going to be," 
said Jeff. " Well, good-by, Mr. Westover. I'll see 
you in Beston." 

" Oh, good-by." The painter freed himself from 
his brush and palette for a parting handshake, reluc- 
tantly. 

Jeff plunged down the hill, waving a final adieu 
from the corner of the hotel before he vanished round 
it. 

Mrs. Vostrand and her daughter were at breakfast 



 

when Westover came in after the early light had been 
gone some time. They entreated him to join them at 
their table, and the mother said : " I suppose you were 
up soon enough to see young Mr. Durgin ofi. Isn't 
it too bad he has to go back to college when it's so 
pleasant in the country ? " 

" Not bad for him," said Westover. " He's a young 
man who can stand a great deal of hard work." Partly 
because he was a little tired of JeS, and partly because 
he was embarrassed in their presence by the reason of 
his going, he turned the talk upon the days they had 
known together. 

Mrs. Vostrand was very willing to talk of her past, 
even apart from his, and she told him of her sojourn 
in Europe since her daughter had left school. They 
spent their winters in Italy and their summers in 
Switzerland, where it seemed her son was still at his 
studies in Lausanne. She wished him to go to Har- 
vard, she said, and she supposed he would have to 
finish his preparation at one of the American schools ; 
but she had left the choice entirely to Mr. Vostrand. 

This seemed a strange event after twelve years' 
stay in Europe for the education of her children, but 
Westover did not feel authorized to make>any com- 
ment upon it. He fell rather to thinking how very 
pleasant both mother and daughter were, and to won- 
dering how much wisdom they had between them. 
He reflected that men had very little wisdom, as far 
as he knew them, and he questioned whether, after 
all, the main difference between men and women might 
not be that women talked their follies and men acted 


theirs. Probably Mrs. Vostrand, with all her babble, 
had done fewer foolish things than her husband, but 
here Westover felt his judgment disabled by the fact 
that he had never met her husband ; and his mind be- 
gan to wander to a question of her daughter, whom he 
had there before him. He found himself bent upon 
knowing more of the girl, and trying to eliminate her 
mother from the talk, or at least to make Genevieve 
lead in it. But apparently she was not one of the 
natures that like to lead; at any rate she remained 
discreetly in abeyance, and Westover fancied she even 
respected her mother's opinions and ideas. He thought 
this very well for both of them, whether it was the 
efEect of Mrs. Vostrand's merit or Miss Vostrand's 
training. They seemed both of one exquisite gentle- 
ness, and of one sweet manner, which was rather elab- 
orate and formal in expression. They deferred to each 
other as politely as they deferred to him, but, if any- 
thing, the daughter deferred most. 



XVII. 

The Vostrands did not stay long at Lion's Head. 
Before the week was out Mrs. Vostrand had a letter 
summoning them to meet her husband at Montreal, 
where that mysterious man, who never came into the 
range of Westover's vision, somehow, was kept by 
business from joining them in the mountains. 

Early in October the painter received Mrs. Vos- 
trand's card at his studio in Boston, and learned from 
the scribble which covered it that she was with her 
daughter at the Hotel Vendome. He went at once to 
see them there, and was met, almost before the greet- 
ings were past, with a prayer for his opinion. 

" Favorable opinion ? " he asked. 

" Favorable ? Oh, yes ; of course. It's simply this. 
When I sent you my card, we were merely birds of 
passage, and now I don't know but we are — What is 
the opposite of birds of passage ? " 

Westover could not think, and said so. 

" Well, it doesn't matter. We were walking down 
the street, here, this morning, and we saw the sign of 
an apartment to let, in a window, and we thought, just 
for amusement, we would go in and look at it." 



 

"And you took it?" 

" No, not quite so rapid as that. But it was lovely; 
in such a pretty hotel garni, and. so exquisitely fur- 
nished ! We didn't really think of staying in Boston ; 
we'd quite made up our minds on New York ; but this 
apartment is a temptation." 

" Why not yield, then ? " said Westovcr. " That's 
the easiest way with a temptation. Confess, now, that 
you've tak.en the apartment already ! " 

" No, no, I haven't yet," said Mrs. Vostrand. 

" And if I advised not, you wouldn't ? " 

" Ah, that's another thing ! " 

" When are you going to take possession, Mrs. Vos- 
trand ? " 

" Oh, at once, I suppose — if we do ! " 

" And may I come in when I'm hungry, just as I 
used to do in Florence, and will you stay me with 
flagons in the old way ? " 

" There never was anything but tea, you know well 
enough." 

" The tea had rum in it." 

" Well, perhaps it will have rum in it here, if you're 
very good." 

" I will try my best, on condition that you'll make 
any and every possible use of me. Mrs. Vostrand, I 
can't tell you how very glad I am you're going to stay," 
said the painter, with a fervor that made her impul- 
sively put out her hand to him. He kept it while he 
could add, " I don't forget — I can never forget — how 
good you were to me in those days," and at that she 
gave his hand a quick pressure. " If I can do any- 



 

thing at all for you, you will let me, won't you. I'm 
afraid -you'll be so well provided for that there won't 
be anything. Ask them to sligbt you, to misuse you 
in something, so that I can come to your rescue." 

" Yes, I will," Mrs. Vostrand promised. " And may 
we come to your studio to implore your protection ? " 

"The sooner the better." Westover got himself 
away with a very sweet friendship in his heart for this 
rather anomalous lady, who, more than half -her daugh- 
ter's life, had lived away from her daughter's father, 
upon apparently perfectly good terms with him, and 
so discreetly and self-respectfully that no breath of 
reproach had touched her. Until now, however, her 
position had not really concerned Westover, and it 
would not have concerned him now, if it had not been 
for a design that formed itself in his mind as soon as 
he knew that Mrs. Vostrand meant to pass the winter 
in Boston. He felt at once that he could not do things 
by halves for a woman who had once done them for 
him by wholes and something over, and he had in- 
stantly decided that he must not only be very pleasant 
to her himself, but he must get his friends to be pleas- 
ant, too. His friends were some of the nicest people 
in Boston ; nice in both the personal and the social 
sense ; he knew they would not hesitate to sacrifice 
themselves for him in a good cause, and that made 
him all the more anxious that the cause should be 
good beyond question. 

Since his last return from Paris he had been rather 
a fad as a teacher, and his class had been kept quite 
strictly to the ladies who got it up and to such as they 



 

chose to let enter it. These were not all chosen for 
wealth or family ; there were some whose gifts gave 
the class distinction, and the ladies were glad to have 
them. It would be easy to explain Mrs. Vostrand to 
these, but the others might be more difiBcult; they 
might have their anxieties, and Westover meant to ask 
the leader of the class to help him receive at the studio 
tea he had at once imagined for the Vostrands, and 
that would make her doubly responsible. 

He found himself drawing a very deep and long 
breath before he began to mount the many stairs to 
his studio, and wishing either that Mrs. Vostrand had 
not decided to spend the winter in Boston, or else 
that he were of a slacker conscience and could wear 
his gratitude more lightlj'. But there was some relief 
in thinking that he could do nothing for a month yet. 
He gained a degTee of courage by telling the ladies, 
when he went to find them in their new apartment, that 
he should want them to meet a few of his friends at 
tea as soon as people began to get back to town ; and 
he made the most of their instant joy in accepting his 
invitation. 

His pleasure was somehow dashed a little, before 
he left them, by the announcement of Jefi Durgin's 
name. ' 

" I felt bound to send him my card," said Mrs. 
Vostrand, while JeflE was following his up in the eleva- 
tor. " He was so very kind to us the day we arrived 
at Lion's Head ; and I — didn't know but he might be 
feeling a little sensitive about coming over second- 
cabin in our ship ; and — " 



 

" How like you, Mrs. Vostrand ! " cried Westover, 
and he was now distinctly glad he had not tried to 
sneak out of doing something for her. " Your kind- 
ness won't be worse wasted on Durgin than it was on 
me, in the old days, when I supposed I had taken a 
second-cabin passage for the voyage of life. There's 
a great deal of good in him ; I don't mean to say he 
got through his Freshman year without trouble with 
the college authorities, but the Sophomore year gen- 
erally brings wisdom." 

" Oh," said Mrs. Vostrand, " they're always a little 
wild at first, I suppose." 

Later, the ladies brought Jefi with them when they 
came to Westover's studio, and the painter perceived 
that they were very good friends, as if they must have 
met several times since he had seen them together. 
He interested himself in the growing correctness of 
JefE's personal efiect. During his Freshman year, 
while the rigor of the unwritten Harvard law yet for- 
bade him a silk hat or a cane, he had kept something 
of the boy, if not the country boy. Westover had 
noted that he had always rather a taste for clothes, 
but in this first year he did not get beyond a derby- 
hat and a sack-coat, varied towards the end by a cut- 
away. In the outing dress he wore at home he was 
always effective, but there was something in Jefli's fig- 
ure which did not lend itself to more formal fashion ; 
something of herculean proportion which would have 
marked him of a classic beauty perhaps if he had not 
been in clothes at all, or of a yeomanly vigor and 
force if he had been clad for work, but which seemed 




to threaten the more worldly conceptions of the tailor 
with danger. It was as if he were about to burst out 
of his clothes, not because he wore them tight, but 
because there was somehow more of the man than 
the citizen in him ; something native, primitive, some- 
thing that Westover could not find quite a word for, 
characterized him physically and spiritually. When 
he came into the studio after these delicate ladies, the 
robust JefE Durgin wore a long frock-coat, with a flow- 
er in his button-hole, and in his left hand he carried 
a silk hat turned over his forearm as he must have 
noticed people whom he thought stylish carrying their 
hats. He had on dark-gray trousers and sharp-pointed 
enamelled-leather shoes ; and Westover grotesquely 
reflected that he was dressed, as he stood, to lead 
Genevieve Vostrand to the altar.
