" That's all right," he said, " don't mention it. 
Now they will have decided in a few days, and 
I will write you " 

" Xo, please do not," I said, still with my ab- 
ject humility. " Don't take any more trouble — 
let me go there and find out " 

" By no means! " said he. " Take my advice 
and don't go near there again under any circum- 
stances. You can't tell how much an author 
hurts himself by troubling a publisher as you 
have done. Don't go near there — let me write 
to you." 

I promised that I would; and then with more 
abjectness I got myself out of that room, and I 
w-ent out and sat down upon a step near by, sim- 
ply shaking like a leaf. 

" Oh, heavens! " I gasped. " That was hor- 
rible! Horrible!" 

I sat dazed — thinking about it — thinking it 
over and over — I couldn't understand it, try as I 
might. Why should he have been so angry that 
day — had he not told me to come there? And 
had he not said I should have a report? 

— And then suddenly something flashed over 
me that made me leap! That firm had written 


him a letter the day before yesterday asking about 
the manuscript, and that was why he was angry! 
And he had sent his secretary down to inquire! — 
But why in Heaven's name should he send his 
secretary down to inquire when he had a tele- 
phone connecting zvith the firm right there in his 
office ! 

And so I saw it — all in one instant the thing 
flashed over me! 

I was so wild I paid a car-fare — I rode straight 
as a die down to that place, and I went in and saw 
the clerk. 

" He has sent the manuscript now," I said, 
" hasn't he? " 

" Yes," she said. 

" He sent it in yesterday? " I said. 

" Yes." 

" He sent it by his secretary, didn't he? " 

" Yes," she said again. 

" Thank you," I answered, and went out. 

Is not that simply monstrous, simply awful 
beyond words? I have been beside myself to- 
night with rage, with amazement, with perplexi- 
ty. Oh, think what I have suffered at the hands 
of that frightful man ! And what have I done to 


him — why should he have treated me so? What 
does it mean? I am baffled every way I turn. 

The thing is like flame in my blood — like 
acid in my veins. It makes me hysterical with 
pain. I cry aloud. 

— What do you mean by it, you monster, 
you wretch? Why, here for eleven weeks I have 
been hanging upon your every word — eleven 
weeks of my life spent in torment — absolutely 
flung away! Eleven weeks! And you have lied 
to me — and you have kicked me about like a 
dog! 

What do you mean? What do you mean? 
Tell me, above all, why you did it! Were you 
torturing me on purpose? Or did you simply 
forget it? But then, how could you forget it 
when you had to tell me all those miserable false- 
hoods? And when you had to write me those 
letters? 

And then to-day! 

That is the thing that goads me most — to- 
day! I stood there cringed before you like a 
beaten cur — you kicked me — you spit upon me! 
And it was every bit of it a lie! That insolent 
rage of yours — why, it wasn't even genuine! 


You weren't even angry — you knew that you 
had no reason to be angry — that you had treated 
me as if I were a worm to tread on! And yet 
you stood there and abused me! 

Oh — why, the thing is madness to think of! 
It is more madness the more you reahze it ! I 
have never known anything like it before in 
my Hfe. 

Yes — actually — it is something quite new to 
me. I have met blind people — people who would 
not heed me — but a really evil person I have 
never known before! A person who has no re- 
spect for another's rights — who would trample 
upon another! Oh, you miserable wretch — and 
the lies — the lies! The hateful sneaking of it — 
you black-hearted, insolent man! The manu- 
script had been there all the time! The delays, 
the routine! And you had sent your secretary 
down to inquire ! And above all — oh, above all — 
the prince of them — I must not go near there 
lest I should injure myself! I must not go near 
them — they were so weary of seeing me ! And I 
never saw a single soul there in my life but one 
clerk! 

I never suffered such a thing as this before in 
all my days — deliberate, brutal injustice! And 


that I should be so placed as to be a victim of 
such a thing — that I should have to hang upon 
your words and to be at your mercy for eleven 
weeks of agony ! You are a great editor, a club- 
man, a rich man ! You have fame and power and 
wealth — and you stand up there and scald me 
with your rage — and with your heart a mess of 
lies all the time! 

— But why did you do it? That is the thing 
I ask myself in consternation. Why? Why? — 
Were you not interested in my work? If you 
weren't — why didn't you give it back to me, and 
let me go my way? And if you were — if you had 
any idea of publishing it — then why did you use 
me in this way? Where was the manuscript all 
this time? What did you mean to do with it? 
How long did you expect me to wait? And what 
object did you have in telling me untruths about 
it meanwhile? 

— The whole thing is as blank to me as night. 
That a man should have in him so much infinite 
indifiference about another as to leave that manu- 
script in a drawer, and write me that I was to 
"have a report on it within a week"! Why, 
it is something of which I can not even think. 


And then to get out of it by that sham anger and 
that sneaking! — 

April 2oth. 
I have done absolutely nothing but brood 
over this thing and rage all day. What am I to 
do? — I sat and wondered if there was anything I 
could do but go and shoot that man. And I 
asked myself: Ought I not at least to go and get 
the manuscript from that accursed place this in- 
stant? Ought I not to have taken it then and 
there? But see the utter misery of my situation, 
the abject shame of it — suppose they were to take 
the thing! It is my one hope in this world — I 
dare not lose it — I have to leave it there! 

But then, what hope is there now? I ask. 
Why, he was going to urge it upon them! And 
now, of course, he's simply sent it in there with- 
out a word! 

Don't you see what it was — it was that let- 
ter of inquiry they wrote him! He paid no more 
attention to me than if I were a hound; but he 
had to send it when they wrote! And perhaps 
they said something about carelessness and that 
made him wild. 

Oh, the thing is an endless spring of gall to 



me! I am all raw with it — I have to rush out 
on the street and walk away my passion. I never 
saw my situation so plainly — the horrible impo- 
tence of it! Just see what I struggle against, 
the utter insane futility of everything I do! 
Why, I beat my wings in a void, I hammer my 
head against a wall ! 

— And now I must wait for that thing to 
come back — don't I know that it will come back? 
And don't I know that that will be the end of me? 

A black, horrible gloom has settled down 
upon me. I am utterly lost in despair. 

April 2 1 St. 
I will write no more about that man — my 
whole being is turned to bitterness. I wonder at 
myself — I have no longer one feeling left in this 
world except a black brooding hatred of him! 

— And all the time the thing haunts me like 
a detective story — I can't find the solution! 
What does it mean? Why did he do it? It is so 
irrational — so impossible — so utterly incompre- 
hensible! And shall I never know the truth about 
it? 



April 24th. 
" We regret that we are not advised to under- 
take the publication of The Captive. We return 
the manuscript by express." 

There it is! I read that thing, and I felt my 
whole being sinking down as if into hell. There 
it is ! And that is the end of it all ! Oh, merciful 
Providence, is it not simply too cruel to be be- 
lieved! Eleven weeks! Eleven weeks! 

— I can do no more — I do not know where 
to turn. I believe I shall go mad with my misery. 

April 25th. 
To-day I thought I would go up and see him 
— I thought I could not live until I knew what 
this thing meant. I heard myself saying, " I de- 
mand to know why you treated me thus? I say 
I demand it! Before God, how dared you — or 
don't you believe in a God? " 

— Then again I thought, I will plead with 
him. It must be some mistake — I can't believe 
that it is all over. Why, he liked it! And now 
perhaps it was only looked over by some careless 
reader and flung aside! 



But no — I could not go near the place! I 
could not face that man again. The memory of 
his look as he stood there in his insolence is so 
hateful to me that it makes me tremble. 

April 26th. 

I see myself crying this out from the house- 
tops. I even wrote a letter to a newspaper, but 
I did not send it. 

I went to a lawyer, a man I used to know. I 
told him I had no money — I asked him to help 
me. But I can not sue him — he was under no 
obligations, it seems; and I can not prove that 
the manuscript was injured in value by the delay. 

So there is nothing that I can do. He will 
go his way — he will never think of me again. He 
is rich and famous. — 

— I have just nine dollars left of my money. 
I can not possibly make it do more than three or 
four weeks; and meanwhile I sit and brood and 
watch them go by in blank despair. 

April 28th. 

I fight with myself — I must get that hellish 
thing out of my head! I went to a publisher's 
to-day — I didn't have the heart to go in, but I 
gave it to the clerk. 







It will take two or three weeks. This will be 
the eighth publisher. 

I said to-day: " I will force myself to read, I 
will get myself together; I will not let myself be 
stamped to the mud by this man." 

There is nothing I can do about it — I only 
poison my whole soul thinking of it. I must put 
it out of my mind — I must work! 

May 1st. 

I said to myself to-day: " Do you really be- 
lieve that the world would heed that poem? Do 
you think that if any publisher published it, he 
could sell it? " I answered, " No, I do not." 

If one took it I should think I was making a 
fool of him. I offer it on that chance! 

— What am I going to do? I do not know. 
I must try to find some work that does not tear 
me to pieces; and then perhaps some day I shall 
be able to write something different. 

May 3d. 
My whole soul is in a turmoil these days. I 
struggle, — I can not give up while I live; but 
for what do I struggle? I am a man journeying 
in a thicket; I can not see one step before me. 


— I try to forget myself — I try to get interest- 
ed in a book. But I never had but one kind of 
interest. I can not get used to living without a 
purpose, without enthusiasm, without morality. 

I have no ideas any more. My whole life is 
shrunken and contracted. It is all stagnant — the 
garden of my soul is full of weeds. The broad 
fields that I used to cover, the far-off things I 
used to strive for — what have they to do with 
me now? 

— I heard a gull to-day — far, far up — a mere 
speck in the sky. I started, as I watched him 
vanish. Then I said: " But you, too, will have to 
come down and mingle in the turmoil and the 
danger! " 

May 6th. 

I go over into the Park — the springtime is in 
full glory, all the sights that used to thrill my 
heart are there; the splendor of new verdure and 
young flowers, the birds that I love rioting in 
song. But it moves me not in the least, it only 
makes me ten times more mournful. I turn 
away. 

Why, once an apple spray in blossom was to 
me a drunken ecstasy. 




— Shall I ever know what it is to be gener- 
ous, and rich and royal in my heart again? To 
know that surging fulness of emotion that 
makes you think of gold and purple and regal 
pomp? 

I tell you the whole thing is a question of 
money with me. I have come down to the bare 
bed-rock of sordidness — I must have money — 
money! — It is everything in this world to me. I 
can never think of anything else again until I 
have it. 

I see myself going out into the world and 
fighting as other men fight, and making a place in 
it for myself. 

May 8th. 

I am getting down again; my poor hoard 
is going! I sit and count it — I calculate it — 
I lay out my bill of fare. Oh, where shall I 
go, what can I do? Can I write anything? I 
ask. I have nothing in me but a naked, shiver- 
ing longing. 

I dread to be in the desperate fix I was the 
last time I could find no work. And yet I can 
not make up my mind to do anything until I hear 
from this one publisher more. 



May 5ciL 
I walked over there to-<lay to save a pcstEge- 
stamp. They had not heard from the reader yei. 

— I sir down and try to sitidy. Then I get up 

and say I ought r.ot to put it off any longer. 

Tzen again I think: "Wai: until to-morrow, at 

any rate." 

May loth. 

I was looking at that mans magazine to-day. 

V."hat thoughts it brought to me — v.hat agonies. 

vrhat longings, what despair! And, above all, 

what ocean-noods of bitterness! 



I walked ail the way down to the wholesale- 
paper store. I thought I would prefer that to 
evils that I know not of. I have almost a terror 
of having to come into contact with new people. 

But my place was filled. I trudged home 
again. I went to the publisher's too; nothing 
vet. The three weeks were up to-day. 

Mav i. 
I dared not wait any more to-day. I had 
just three dollars and ten cents left. And m.y 
rent is due the day after to-morrow. I have an- 
swered every sort of advertisement, from dish- 






washing to tutoring a boy. I guess I looked too 
seedy for the latter. 

— Sometimes when I am wandering around 
in all this misery, still yearning for what I might 
have been, the thought comes across my mind: 
" And in this huge world there might yet be some 
one who would understand the thing! Some one 
who would help me! Some one by whom it 
would be an honor to be helped — if I could only 
find him." 

And here I am, having my life beaten out of 
me, spark by spark, — and I can't find him — I 
can't! 

I cry out for money — for money ! 

But no, it is others who have it. — And the 
way that they use it — O God, the way that 
they use it! 

If all the world were poor, it would not be so 
bad; but the sight of wealth — of infinite oceans 
of it squandered in perfect frenzies of ostentation! 
The sight of this " world " — this world, which 
they take quite as a matter of course ! 

I have seen a good deal of this world myself, 
and I at least do not take it thus. I gaze upon 



the men and women who do take it thus, and I 
say, " Are you men and women really? Or are 
you not some strange, un-Godmade creatures, 
without ever a thought about justice, without 
ever a gleam of reason or purpose or sense? " 

May 14th. 
I have tramped the streets for two days more. 
I was made so ill by my anxiety last time that I 
made up my mind I would not risk it again. I 
asked my landlady to-night to wait a while, as I 
was looking for some work. She was ungracious 
enough, but I have no longer any sensibilities — 
I only want to be safe. She can wait — she has 
my trunk, as I told her. 

Probably she wouldn't even be as willing, if 
she could see what is in it! I have no longer any- 
thing to sell. I had to exchange my waiter's cos- 
tume for a pair of trousers, for mine were all in 
rags. 

I have two dollars and seventy cents. I im- 
agine that is a safe margin. 

There are no words that can tell what an ab- 
solutely deadening thing it is to be wandering 
about the city looking for work. It turns yon 







into a log of wood — you not only no longer have 
an idea, you have not a thought of an idea. You 
simply drag on and on until the thing becomes 
a habit, and you go without even thinking of 
that. 

May 15th. 
" Our readers have examined with a great 
deal of interest the unusual piece of work which 
you have sent us. But it has been our experience 
that poetry proves such a distressing adventure 
commercially, that we are forced to decline the 
ofifer which you have so kindly made us. We 
wish, however, to assure you of our desire to see 
anything else which you may have on hand, or 
may have at any time in future." 

That is about the way the letter ran — I tore it 
up. I did not read it but once. I took the thing 
to another firm — it can't do any harm. 

I have not been able to find anything to-day. 

May 1 6th. 
So long as I have thoughts I can write a 
journal; but while my life is that of an animal, 
it doesn't seem very necessary. I have always 
felt myself an outcast — a poet has to be that; but 
I never felt it quite so much as at present. I wan- 


der around from door to door; and those who 
have homes and money and power — they simply 
order me out of the way. 

May 1 8th. 

I do not think I can stand this much longer. 
I never had such a time' before finding anything. 
I think my state must be written in my face — 
men no longer have any use for me. 

I fear my coat is seedy. And I know my col- 
lar is soiled; but the two I left at the laundry 
won't be done till to-morrow. 

I have broken my last two-dollar bill. I 
watch in terror for the next week — I can not face 
that woman again. I must save enough for that. 

May 19th. 

I applied for a position as office-boy to- 
day — I was desperate. I have not enough to 
last me through a week, if I pay the woman 
anything. 

But they said I was too old. 

My feet are most horribly sore. I can hardly 
walk. And I have the strangest ringing in 
my head. I could not eat any supper — and 
the milk won't keep in this warm weather, 
either. 



May 22d. 

The day before yesterday, when I woke up in 
the morning, I could hardly stand. My head was 
on fire, and I do not think I have ever been so 
sick before. I got around to a drug-store — the 
man said he would give me some powders; he 
said they were forty cents, but I dared not pay 
it. He gave them to me for a quarter. He said 
I should have a tonic, but I haven't had it. 

I was too ill to move all day yesterday. I am 
better to-day, but still I daren't go out. I have 
only eighty-five cents left. 

I must manage to get out and get some work 
to-morrow, or I shall go mad. 

I had a scene with that horrible creature yes- 
terday. It was the second week — she thought I 
was shamming, I know. She said she never 
allowed her " roomers " to get behindhand — it 
was her invariable rule. O God, I was so sick 
I could scarcely see — I did not care what she did. 
I told her that I had no money; that I was wait- 
ing to get some work; that I would pay her the 
first moment I could. 

" Why don't you keep work when you get 


it? " she demanded. " You have been idle nearly 
all the whole time you've been here." 

I could not argue with her; she can turn me 
out when she likes. 

May 24th. 

I dragged myself out to-day. I feel better 
except for the blisters on my feet. But nothing 
to do! Nothing to do! Oh, I am half mad. 

I thought to-day I would call upon some of 
my relatives. But I bit my lips together — no, I 
will not ever do that! 

It is the ghastly heat that kills me. Yester- 
day was almost stifling, I thought I could not 
bear it. I never knew it to be so hot so early. 

May 26th. 
I have got but thirty-five cents, and to-day I 
was so tired I had to rest for two hours neverthe- 
less. Oh, merciful heavens, but this is fiery tor- 
ture! 

It is half a week again. I know she will not 

let me stay another week. I did a strange thing 

— I wrapped up all my papers and carried them 

out under my coat. She can keep everything 







else I have, but my papers are mine. I took 
them to the grocery-store where I buy things 
and asked the man to keep them for me. 

May 27th. 

What does a man do when he wants to work 
and can't find anything? Does he really starve? 
Or does he get locked up? Or what? 

I said to-day: I will eat nothing but bread 
and oatmeal till I get something to do. 

May 29th. 
It was just as I thought. She has demanded 
her money — and I have but fifteen cents! I 
helped a man up with a trunk and got ten. She 
told me that I would have to get out. It is 
clear to-night. I shall sleep somewhere in the 
Park. I can not write any more. 

May 31st. 
I got some work to do after all — at the height 
of my despair. I am giving out samples of a 
hitherto unequaled brand of soap. 

It was yesterday morning, I met one of the 

men and asked him where he got the job. He 

said they wanted more men, so I got on a car 

and rode down there in haste. I made fifty cents 


yesterday, for half a day, and a dollar to-day. 
Thank God! 

I spent the night before last in the Park, and 
last night in the room where I am sitting. It is 
in a tenement-house. I paid fifty cents a week 
for it, and there is a dntnken man snoring on the 
other side of a board partition. 

I sha'n't go back to the other place, of 
course, until I get more money. Besides, she 
has probably rented the room. 

I am so relieved at having gotten something 
to do. I beheve I am even proud of the soap. 

I am getting used to walking all day; any- 
thing so long as one doesn't have the agonizing 
worry about star'ation. I am ill, but I shall keep 
at it, and answer advertisements meanwhile by
