look and listen, and ringing in our ears 
shall be one or another majestic chant, 
like the solemn prophecy of a greater 
hope and a more splendid journey : — 

" My purpose holds 
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 


Of all the western stars, until I die. 
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down : 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew." 

 

Few are the pens of perfect technique, 
and only such may fitly couple the 
ethereal with the grossly utilitarian. So by 
a good-fortune not always regnant, even 
in the happy world of verse, it fell to 
Aldrich to link the praise of "dreamy 
words" and "very pleasant eating." His 
was the good word, for he was bom to 
see and sing ; but ours shall be the 
joyous deed, especially when we have set 
forth on pilgrimage to inherit the earth. 
On such days, far from the mahogany- 
tree we left behind us, every homely act 
gains a new significance ; and unfamiliar 
food fits itself, not only to the nourishment 
of corporeal particles, but to that 
spiritual life wherewith we draw our only 
vital breath. So that it becomes the wise 
to refrain from considering eating as an 
exact science, — so much nitrogen, so 
many units of energy, — and to merge it 
into a contemplative and poetic deUght, 
unknown to him who only eats to live. 
On such a topic it is impossible to speak 


impersonally, or to shield one's self be- 
hind the egotistical bulwark of the edi- 
torial we. It is necessary to betake us 
individually to the small go-cart of the 
first person ; for who ever ate altruistically, or chewed the cud of a foreign 
flavor, save to his own self-limited 
delight ? To speak straitly, then, as a unit 
whose yea would fain, in this matter, be 
simply yea, I frankly avow that my shal- 
lop of joy in English travel was upborne 
upon an ever -buoyant wave of table- 
delight. The earliest May-blossom, the 
first English daisy, quivered in white 
before my seeking eyes, wraith-pictures 
from the land of dreams ; the first 
English gooseberry tart stood forth a more 
substantial but no less joyous herald of 
welcome to a soil whose heroes have ever 
held tankard and trencher in honorable 
repute. What fruit this side the land 
of pure delight can rival the English 
strawberry.? the only sort of immortal 
joy you can buy by the pound. And 
though, alas! no purveyor shall 
henceforth bring us tribute from the garden 
of "my lord of Ely," so also nothing 
short of an irresponsive palate can
deprive us of that flavor underlying the rosy 





flesh even in the days of Tyrant Rich- 
ard. I ate my first strawberry from a 
little basket (you know the shape, dear 
pilgrim !) in a field bordering the Nun's 
Walk, on the banks of Itchen. And so 
corpulent was the fruit, so grown beyond 
all reason, though lacking nothing of 
tenderness and fragrance, that we meas- 
ured its bulk with a wisp of grass, and 
sent the boastful girth home to one who 
would have been with us, had the gods 
dealt tenderly. In Devon, more straw- 
berries, some eaten in an exquisite dairy- 
shop off the cathedral close, at Exeter, 
their nectarous juices enriched and soft- 
ened with clotted cream, and set off by 
cloying junket, as a country lass by her 
hot-house sister. It was at Ilfracombe, 
later in this progress of delight, that a 
matron, pink of cheek and gown, gave 
us the recipe for the clotted cream, most 
delectable product of the red-soiled south. 
But you cannot "bring home the river 
and sky." You shall have Devon cattle, 
and learn the tricks of the dairy from a 
thousand years' inheritance, else your 
cream will turn out a plain and whole- 
some compound of the taste of scalded 
milk: and no charm, even the specific 

 

furnished the guileless Annie by Coun- 
sellor Doone, shall avail you. 

It was in a little Warwick shop that I 
was first made one with weal and 'am 
pie, that concoction so cunningly traduced by Sam Weller that no one may 
eat it, from his time forth, without a 
premonitory shudder. 

" ' Weal pie,' " said Mr. Weller, solilo- 
quizing, as he arranged the eatables on 
the grass. " ' Very good thing is a weal 
pie, when you know the lady as made it, 
and is quite sure it ain't kittens.' " 

But the verdict of the American palate 
was altogether favorable. "Much like 
the British character," says retrospect. 
" Solid and satisfying, and ' pleasant, too, 
to thmk on ! '" 

At Dulverton, immortal halting-place 
of John Ridd as he rode home from 
school across the moors, on the occasion 
of his standing up like a pixy in the dark, 
and shouting prophetic defiance to the 
returning Doones, a culinary disappoint- 
ment lay coldly in wait. We would fain 
have duplicated John Fry's order, — 
" ' Hot mootton pasty, zame as I hardered 
last Tuesday ; ' " but there was no time 
for the cooking, and we went away with 
 

the sacred rite undone. Moreover, not in 
all Devon did mention of pickled loaches, 
the love whereof first led little John into 
the Doone Valley, do more than rouse a 
wondering look on the face of the myth- 
ignoring inhabitants. But, we might 
have asked, to what end should Devon 
kitchens exist, save for the perpetuating 
of sacred lore and setting before the 
reverent palate hot coUops of venison, such 
as were approved by its tutelary giant, 
and all else that went to the nourishing 
of his mightiness } Shame on him who 
would remove one guidepost of the culinary 
past, one viand embalmed in story ! 
Let his name be anathema, though he 
invent a thousand modem trifles, or a 
sauce to outrival Worcestershire. For 
no tickling of the palate under new com- 
binations can compensate for the starving 
of the soul. 

You who have trodden English by- 
paths and fallen in with ancient ways, 
did you ever eat English buns without 
a jingling mental accompaniment to the 
tune of the old nursery rhyme.? And 
though you consumed them luxuriously 
in the London ABC shops, or made 
your touring staff that other variety to 
 

be found, yellow with saffron, beside the 
Cornish sea, were they not soul-satisfy- 
ing and plummy ? I charge you, O seek- 
ers of inward joy, by all the past eating 
you have ever done, to your own enlarge- 
ment of vision, that, when you come 
upon a classic dish, you pass it not by. 
And north and south the traditionary 
riches of the kitchen shall be yours. For 
in Derbyshire, you shall eat Bakewell 
pudding, of the genus tart, having, as 
one greater than the world of realists 
hath said, "a sort of mixed flavor of 
cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast tur- 
key, toffy, and hot buttered toast." At 
Banbury, or possibly farther afield among 
the Shakespeare haunts, you may pur- 
chase the unholy Banbury cake, which is 
no less than a superlatively rich mince 
turnover, evidently without the meat, 
but compensating for all conventional 
lack by fruits and spices. Without 
doubt it will trouble your dreams, for 
no Banbury cake ever did its spiriting 
gently; but in the end, when absence 
shall have softened every harsh detail 
of that English journey, it will linger, a 
spicy savor, in your happy memory. You 
shall eat haggis and scones in Scotland, 


roast goose and apple-sauce wherever 
you can get them, star-gazing pie in 
Cornwall (filled with pilchards, their in- 
nocent heads protruding above the crust), 
and go, like all your generation and the 
fathers of the English-speaking race, to 
Richmond, to dine at the Star and Garter, 
upon whitebait and Richmond maids-of- 
honor. You shall eat chad from Lake 
Windermere, in memory of the Roman 
legions who carried that royal family 
thither; and everywhere shall you bow 
down before old England's roast beef, 
though she import it from Australia or 
America, and so hold historic lien upon 
it by courtesy only. Her chops, of a 
thickness and succulence unknown in 
the golden West, shall tell their own 
story of growth in fields fat with yellow 
mustard blooms, where the innocent 
sheep hourly nibble and munch, uncon- 
scious that such sunny joy is decreed 
but for the flavoring of tissue. All this 
may you have for the paltry exchange of 
shillings; but, as for the salmi put to- 
gether by the weaving fingers of Becky 
Sharp for her bamboozled brother-in-law, 
even the prince of the power of imagina- 
tion shall fail to resuscitate that. Such 

salmis are dead and gone with Becky 
and the snows of yester-year. 

No bread and beer in England mingle 
such savor of lovely past and present as 
the bit and sup making up the dole of 
Saint Cross Hospital, and served to any 
wayfarer at the open hatch. There, in 
tantalizing nearness to the custodian's 
blue china within the lodge (china which 
is not for you !) and neighbored by the 
green quadrangle where the gowned 
brethren go pottering about in serene 
relinquishment of care, you linger at 
will (so you come but once a day !) sip- 
ping your horn cup as it were elixir. 
This is no bread and beer alone, but a 
heartening food, a magic draught, holding 
all the flavor of that idyllic walk, when, 
awed with peace and "soft as bees by 
Catherine Hill," you cross the meadow 
from Winchester by ways parcel -gilt 
with golden mimulus, where the river 
dreams of gentle things and the breath 
of cattle scents the air. For me, too, 
it keeps the memory of that day when 
I first bent over the opulent, homely 
flower-beds, and asked the brother whose 
art was gardening what name he gave 
the ladies'-delights cosily settled there. 
 

" Lublidles/' he returned, in some cour- 
teous interest that one could call them 
otherwise. 

Shakespeare's love - in - idleness ! In 
some spots — be thankful ! — the world 
does not move. 

What memories are ours of the first 
crab essayed at Seaton, where we at- 
tacked him gingerly, not knowing his 
kind, and mentally repelling the simile 
of ossified spiders ! The waiter stood by, 
meantime, fraternal over a maiden effort 
and solicitous for the fame of Devon. 
His self -forgetful joy when the venture 
was made and we vowed our fealty then 
and there to the worthy crustacean — 
that was something to see ! What shall 
despoil us of the day when we halted 
before a mediaeval-seeming shop near old 
Bristors Christmas Steps, and read the 
longing on the faces of three children 
standing there without, staring hard at 
the winkles, cockles and mussels in the 
window ? 

" Which are the nicest ? " asked we 
with the humility of the non-elect. 

" Mussels, miss ! " rang the concerted 
shout, whereupon tuppence each turned 
the loiterers into mussel-eating monarchs. 
i 

Two of US will never set eyes on the 
London barrows loaded with like marine 
delicacies without choking reminiscence 
of a certain expedition planned, gloated 
over in the night-watches and never ac- 
complished. For we had invited a lady 
of social high degree, who knows only 
poetic and fashionable London, and for 
whom the City is a myth, to vouchsafe 
us one day wherein to show her the 
World and the joys thereof. She should 
ride on the tops of 'buses, she should be 
presented to the Duke of SuflFolk's head, 
resident in the Minories, salute Gog and 
Magog, and pause before the tree " at the 
corner of Wood Street.'' But alas! in 
a moment of ill-judged prophecy we re- 
ferred to the mussels of Shoreditch to 
be purchased from a barrow and dipped 
in the public vinegar ; and being daintily 
nurtured, thenceforth she would none of 
our unholy pranks. 

Milk is no uncommon beverage, yet 
sometimes it has a taste of all Arcadia. 
One June day when we were on the 
march brought us to the Welsh paradise 
of Montgomery, where Magdalen Her- 
bert's castle heights are standing, crown- 
less, wonderful. We were entering the 
 

village foot-sore but never weary (and 
with no time for food, for there were 
many miles to tramp, that night, before 
we got home to our den, O) and there, 
providentially meeting us, came a clean 
woman driving a clean cow into a tidy 
yard. Never was bargain more swiftly 
sealed. She disappeared to bring two 
bright glasses and a quart measure. 
She milked and we, throned on a strip 
of turf, drank, while round about us 
thronged the village children, solemnly 
classifying two gaitered, short-skirted 
and apparently hollow monsters. That 
was milk such as they drink on Olympus 
when Hebe serves, though possibly only 
a cut above the draughts permanently on 
tap, for a penny or for love, at farm-house 
doors. 

We are wise, we who go gypsying. 
We have known what it is to find mush- 
rooms on the Stratford Road and to smell 
them, one strange Dorset day, through a 
choking mist through which the trees 
seemed walking toward us as we went. 
How good must elf-men be, we said, to 
set a banquet there for such as are born 
with eyes and nose ! We have learned 
the soul-satisfying quality of raw tujnips, 

 

for we fed thereon, one hungry, happy 
afternoon in Kent. We have lived. 

Certain harmless fictions dominate the 
English mind regarding the national 
"victuals." Smile over them, and enjoy 
the more. You may long for apples, and 
" seek all day ere you find them ; '' for 
the English apple, as it appears in the 
market, is prone to show a degree of 
hardness known to us in no article of 
food save sugar gooseberries. " I like a 
good tasty apple meself," said an English 
wench, setting white teeth into a knurly 
pippin ; " something to bite on ! " She 
had it; a baby foreordained to gums 
might have cut molars upon it. You 
may ask plaintively for vegetables, in 
ordering your dinner, to be answered 
daily, with a narve air of delighted dis- 
covery, "Potatoes!" And should you 
hint at a larger ambition, a nobler quest, 
you may count yourself proud and happy 
if the omnipresent pea is an available 
candidate, albeit the only one. There 
may be set before you a loathsome and 
greasy compound with the encouraging 
dictum, "This is an American dough- 
nut ! '' (An historic introduction : " Pud- 
ding — Alice ; Alice — pudding. Re- 

 

move the pudding!") But though, for 
honor's sake, you deny the fallacy, you 
shall eschew its ocular proof. Every- 
where seek out the native and historic 
dish; and some happy day, if Fortune 
fawn upon you, roasted crabs may hiss 
for you in the bowl, and you shall have 
saffron in the warden pies. 

 

We would hear the nightingale, but, 
more slenderly equipped than John Bur- 
roughs in the same fine quest, we had 
not the certainty of making literary capi- 
tal out of our ill-success. For us failure 
was failure : a handful of the summer's 
gold irretrievably wasted. At Warwick, 
sure of place "and time agreeing," we 
made careful inquiry where the bird of 
wonder might be sought. According to 
the popular voice, the woods were full of 
nightingales ; I remember writing home, 
in a fit of emulous extravagance, that the 
tongues thereof daily served the castle 
lord and lordlings for breakfast. "Go 
down on the bridge, miss, at nine o'clock," 
said the optimistic landlady. " They do 
sing there most beautiful. 'Know one 
when you hear him ? ' Yes, indeed, miss ! 
You can't mistake a nightingale ! " Like 
all who love their gloriously mediaeval 
and frankly dirty Warwick as she may 
be loved, we were accustomed to make 
a worshipful pilgrimage down past the 
 

castle at twilight, chiefly to steal dreams 
from one pink rose hanging high on the 
castle wall ; and so it came about that 
our observance appropriately ended with 
the bridge and the greater quest. That 
rose held strange emphasis in those War- 
wick days ; it played a part as real and 
wonderful as the role of princess in tales 
of fairydom. Little rosy breaths came 
from her petals, grew into clouds of fan- 
tasy and enveloped us. Our minds walked 
dimly in a morning haze. We imagined 
much about her, as one may about a rose. 
She suggested to us her who seemed to 
us then the Fairest of Women, and we 
made our lady Countess of Warwick 
(Cophetua's immortal maid !) hung there 
in her sweet deserving upon the antiquity 
of the house like that rose upon the stabile 
wall. And though I have been there 
since and the dirty white peacock flaunts 
himself with the same ill-judged vanity, 
and not one bourgeoning spray is less on 
the ruined bridge without the gates, 
Warwick Castle is never the same to me ; 
for that one rose is gone, and no sister 
flower could ever take her place. So we 
dreamed until the dusk enfolded us, and 
then went happily on to the bridge, stout- 
 

hearted in desire and belief. There we 
paced and leaned and lingered, dallying 
with dampness and grave in discussion. 
The question was of mighty import, and 
always the same. When that liquid note 
was once entrapped, should we too find 
it and remember it jugy jug? We were 
wise, that summer. We knew how vital 
it was, how much more to be desired 
than great statecraft, to know whether 
her lamenting did so run, or whether it 
must melt into some strange wild note 
too untamable for even poets' para- 
phrasing. We need not have striven. 
The long summer twilights passed : the 
skies paled, and faded into dusk. De- 
feated seekers of a wealth more to be 
desired than El Dorado, there was no- 
thing for us but to creep home, chilled 
and vanquished, to bed. Then it was that 
we bethought us of confiding in an all- 
knowing cab-driver, and his hopefulness 
put discouragement to shame. " Night- 
ingales, miss } '' quoth he. " Yes, miss, I 
know exactly where they sing. A mile 
or so out of Warwick is a lonely bit of 
road, and they hold regular concerts there. 
I went by last night, and they were 
a-singing away like everything. I could 

 

take you out, miss, for 'arf a crown ! '' 
Was ever tempting bait more cunningly 
offered? We were caught, and that 
night at ten o'clock, John, with a friend 
on the box (both faithfully dressed to 
represent Rogue Riderhood villains), 
drove up in state. I have not yet been 
able to decide why these two beguilers 
of the American purse came thus dis- 
guised. They had pulled their hats low 
over their eyes, they had tied flaring 
handkerchiefs about their necks, and had 
turned up their collars at a murderous 
angle. They may have had some exalted 
idea of a practical joke ; they may have 
been afraid of the damp. We rattled 
away, and John asked us respectfully, yet 
with meaning, if there were not frequent 
murders in America; he told us folk- 
tales of horror, and then, at the moment 
when my spinal marrow was properly 
chilled, drew up the horse, on a lonely 
bit of road, and announced, sepulchrally, 
" This is the very place ! " I had nearly 
shrieked, "O, save me, Hubert, save 
me ! " but I remembered the nightingale, 
and held my peace. Whether the night- 
ingale was also mindful of us I know not, 
but he was silent, too. For one hour we 
 

sat there, and then drove slowly home- 
ward, cold and depressed, our base guides 
assuring each other, by the way, that 
never, in all their lives, had they heard 
of such a circumstance; still did they 
insist that nightingales were always mak- 
ing musical clamor at that particular 
spot. 

With saddened hearts, we relinquished 
the quest ; but one night, at Stratford, 
sitting in the coffee-room of the Red 
Horse Inn, we mentioned our forlorn 
pursuit before two young English boys. 
They were knightly souls and ready. 
They knew well where Philomel lamented 
on the Warwick Road, and there would 
they lead us, if we chose to go. Instantly 
we were afoot with them in the moonlit 
dusk, where the hedgerows smelled of 
bloom, talking until the way grew lonely 
(and so provocative of hope), and learning 
something, I am persuaded, even in that 
short space, of the finely tempered fibre 
in little English lads. I cannot remem- 
ber what they said ; only that they were 
very frank and very courteous (grown-up 
and bookish, too, as compared with our 
American children, using fine-spun words 
and phrasing with an absolute lack of pre- 
 

tense) and that they breathed the essence 
of all that is rarest in their nationality. 
Had it been this year of grace, 1896, I 
should here assert that they had neigh- 
bored and played with the boys and girls 
of "The Golden Age." One passport to 
their consideration seemed to be the fact 
that, as Americans, we were indubitably 
the countrywomen of Mr. William Win- 
ter. They had rowed with him on the 
Avon ; he had evidently passed the silent 
and terrible scrutiny of a boy's ideals 
and been approved. 

On and on we walked, fields on either 
side, and sweetness of summer all about. 
We talked less and less ; we listened, ex- 
pectant. A lonely corn-crake cried in 
the distance, — sound inharmonious, yet 
fitted to the darkness and the hour. And 
then — listen ! 

"How thick the bursts come crowding through 
the leaves !"

Again — thou hearest ? 
Eternal passion ! 
Eternal pain ! " 

 

No region short of Arcadia was ever 
blest with historian more enthusiastic 
than Charles Kingsley whenever he 
touched upon Devonshire, her charms or 
her story; then was his pen dipped in 
illuminating colors, and he traced the 
outline of her beauties on a page that 
must endure until the memory of Devon 
lads no longer thrills the romance-loving 
heart. When guide-books wax eloquent 
over this fair county, and dry historic 
mention broadens into a sweep of verbal 
imagery, then are the paragraphs hedged 
between telltale quotation marks, and 
a footnote points to Kingsley as the 
source of such just laudation. His sym- 
pathy was perfect ; the light of his genius 
seems to brighten every golden thread in 
the fabric of her story ; and the traveler 
who loves such an unfailing lover can 
scarcely do better than to visit these 
happy haunts with "Westward Ho!" 
and the " Prose Idylls " in hand, as po- 
etic guidebooks. Unlike many a memo- 
 

rable spot, this has a beauty that is all 
its own, holding a peculiar power over 
the human spirit. Not only do the pages 
of its history rouse the heart to quicker 
pulsations by their review of the days 
when there were giants, but even the 
face of nature seems here significant. 
Devonshire may be "relaxing" ,as the 
neighbors of Bow Bells declare, with 
fine and almost depreciatory inflection, 
but nevertheless every breath within its 
borders inevitably exhilarates all who 
love a hero. The English Midlands 
spread out into a fair garden, beautified 
by the hand of man, and gaining grace 
from his necessities. Devonshire is 
all warm luxuriance, rolling waste, and 
stormy breaker. Its moorland wastes 
spread on and on, clothed only by coarse 
grass, heath, and furze; but its clefts 
and chasms are enriched by a marvelous 
fern growth, and cooled by clear moun- 
tain streams holding a multitude of fish 
within their limpid shallows. Dartmoor, 
like Salisbury Plain, is one of nature's 
high altars, to be approached with rever- 
ence and dread. A broad expanse, waste 
and wonderful, it lies like a sea caught 
in commotion and fixed in everlasting re- 
 

pose. The touch of cultivation has never 
disturbed its bosom, yet is it a store- 
house of varied wealth. The antiquary- 
may ponder long, unsatisfied, over its 
gigantic mounds and rocky remains, the 
fisherman fill his creel from its waters, 
and countless sheep nibble the unfenced 
pasturage ; but he whom it most delights 
is the pilgrim who fares along its ways, 
mindless of aught save shifting cloud 
beauties and the outline of the billow- 
ing hills. What treasure-house of form 
and color can match the English sky.? 
Taken at its sunniest, here arches no 
crystal vault of blue, but one diversified 
by an ever-changeful pageant made from 
sunlit feather-down and clouds the color 
of a dove's gray wing, — glorified, never- 
theless, by sapphire intervales. Such a 
procession of airy loveliness awakens a 
wondrous sympathy in Dartmoor below. 
Over its tors sweep the shadows, chased 
by a light that turns the heather to rose, 
and transforms the coarse grass to a 
fabric of warm yellow. One hollow lies 
scowling in darkness ; and lo ! beside it 
a hill smiles, and then laughs outright 
under a golden shaft of sun. 

My own course over the moor led from 
 

the little village of Chagford to Tavi- 
stock, thence to seek Plymouth; and 
when I set foot in that historic town, I 
felt the tightening of Kingsley's grasp 
upon my hand. "Come,'' he seemed 
to say; "here was set the tiny stage 
whereon great parts were played, as if 
only Olympus were to be auditor and 
judge. Come, and keep reverent silence ; 
read and remember ! '' 

Plymouth is a town born for the per- 
petual flaunting of England's glory. It 
sits in well-defended pride, looking calm- 
ly over the waves which are Britannia's 
own, and saying in every line of wall 
and fortress, "Behold my impregnable 
strength ! " Should you, on arriving
