people began to laugh. The lion started to roar; 
and it seemed as if the tigers joined the chorus. 
For a few moments it was a forest concert. 

"If only the hyena would laugh," said Jim. 
The girls were a little nervous. Joe had gone to 

 

get Prince. "Oh, you needn't be a mite afraid. 
Mr. Van Amburgh would just have thrown a 
cloth over his head ; and in his surprise they would 
have had him all right in a moment. I would not 
have missed it for a dollar; though I wouldn't 
care to encounter him in his native wilds." 

"He did look grand surveying the audience," 
said Daisy. " I am so glad I could come for 
everything." 

The Doctor put Hanny and Daisy in the buggy, 
as they were both so slim. Hanny hugged his 
arm, and said in a voice still a trifle shaky, - 

"Weren't you the least bit frightened, Joe? ' 

"Why, I never imagined there was any danger 
until it was over. I think so many people rather 
dazed Mr. Tiger." 

" Oh, if anything had happened to you, what 
should I do?' asked Daisy, with lustrous eyes. 

" Nothing is going to happen to me. You have 
been a brave girl this afternoon, and it is not the 
first time either." 

Her cheek flushed with pleasure. 

It was a great thing to talk over, that and the 
ride on the elephant. Hanny found her natural 
history, and she and her father read about ele- 
phants most of the evening. 

The days were so pleasant that the children 
often took Daisy out in her chair to see them at 
their plays. They went around to Houston Street, 
to the German settlement, as it was beginning to 
be called. Lena and Gretchen were out on their 
stoop with their knitting, and the baby between 





them. They were Lutherans, and they looked 
quite different from the Jews. 

There were still quaint old houses in Ludlow 
and Orchard streets, two stories with dormer 
windows in the roof, and some frame cottages with 
struggling grass-plots. No one dreamed of the 
tall tenements that were to take their places, 
the sewing-machines that were to hum while the 
workers earned their scanty pittance, and swarms 
of children crowded the streets. 

Everybody had more leisure then. Some of 
the women sat and chatted while their little ones 
played about. 

A little girl came out of an alley way with a 
peculiar jerky movement, like a hop and a skip, 
while she kept one hand on her knee. Her hip 
was large, her shoulder pushed up and apparently 
bent over. 

"Hello!" she said to Hanny. "What's the 
matter with her?' nodding her head. "Wish't 
I had a cheer like that. I 'd cut a great swell. 
My! ain't she pritty?" 

"She 's been ill," returned Hanny. 

The child stared a moment and then hopped on. 

"Her father works about the stable," explained 
Hanny, with rising colour. ' She comes up 
sometimes. They 're very poor. Mother gives 
them ever so many things. She can't stand up 
straight ; but she doesn't seem to mind. And one 
leg is so much shorter. The boys call her Cricket, 
and Limpy Dick. " 

"Oh, Hanny, if I were poor and like that!' 

 

The tears came in Daisy's eyes. " I can stand up 
straight, and I am getting to walk quite well. I 
have so much that is lovely and comforting; and 
oughtn't one be thankful not to be real poor? ' 

The little lameter went hopping across the 
street, and called to some children " to look at the 
style ! " 

Down by the corner there was a candy and 
notion store, kept by an old woman with a queer 
wrinkled face framed in with a wide cap-ruffle. 
She had a funny turned-up nose, as if it had hardly 
known which way to grow, and such round red- 
apple cheeks. When it was pleasant, she sat in 
the doorway, regardless of the fate of the heroic 
young woman of Norway. 

" Good day!' she ejaculated. "The Lord 
bless ye. Yon 's got a pretty face, an' I hope it 
will bring her good fortune. ' : She nodded, and 
her cap-ruffle flapped over her face. 

" If ye see that omadhawn of a Biddy Brady in 
yer travels, jist send her home. The babby's 
screamin' himself into fits. Won't her mother 
give it to her whin she comes in ! ' 

Down below the next corner, there was a throng 
of children. One big boy was whistling a jig 
tune, and clapping on his knee. 

"That 's old Mrs. McGiven, " explained Hanny. 
"The school-children go there for cake and candy 
and slate pencils, because hers have such nice 
sharp points. And - - Biddy Brady ! ' 

Jim was with the boys, lie gave Hanny a nod 
and laughed and joined the whistling. 

 

"Oh, Jim Biddy's baby is crying ' 
'Come, start up again, Biddy. You haven't 
given us half a cent's worth! You don't dance 
as good as the little Jew girl on the next 
block." 

"Arrah now " 

" Go on wid yer dancin'. " 

Biddy was a thin, lanky girl with straight dark 
hair that hung in her eyes and over her shoulders. 
A faded checked pinafore, with just plain arm- 
holes, covered her nearly all up. To her spindle 
legs were attached mismatched shoes, twice too 
large, tied around the ankles. One had a loose 
sole that flapped up and down. It really wasn't 
any dancing, for she just kicked out one foot and 
then the other, with such vigor that you wondered 
she didn't go over backward. Her very earnest- 
ness rendered it irresistibly funny. She certainly 
danced by main strength. 

Hanny began again. "Jim, her baby is cry- 
ing-" 

"He sets his living; bv crvins;. I've never 
heard of his doing anything else.' 

Biddy brought her foot down with an emphatic 
thump. 

" There now, not another step do yees get out 
o' me fur that cint. I 've s;ive ye srood measure 


and fancy steps throwed in. An' me shoe is 
danced off me fut, an' me mammy 'll lick me. 
See that now! " and she held up her flapping sole. 
They had to yield to necessity, for none of the 
crowd had another penny. When Biddy realised 





the fact, she ran off home and bought a stick of 
candy to solace herself and the baby. Mrs. Brady 
went out washing, and Biddy cared for the baby 
when she wasn't in the street. It must be 
admitted the babies languished under her care. 

The school-children had a good deal of fun hir- 
ing her to dance. Biddy was shrewd enough 
about the pennies. 

Jim joined the cavalcade as the boys went their 
way. 

"Why, she likes the money," he said in answer 
to an upbraiding remark from Hanny. "That's 
what she does it for. " 

" It was very funny," declared Daisy. " She 's 
such a straight, slim child in that long narrow 
apron. If it hadn't been for the baby, I would 
have given her a penny.' 1 

They went on down the street. There were 
several fancy-goods stores and some pretty black- 
eyed Jewish children with the curliest hair imag- 
inable. There was the big school across the way, 
and a great lock factory, then a row of compara- 
tively nice dwellings. They turned into Avenue 
A., and were in a crowd of Germans. The chil- 
dren and babies all had flaxen or yellow hair and 
roundish blue eyes. The mothers were knitting 
and sewing and chattering in their queer language. 
Even the little girls were knitting lace and stock- 
ings. The boys seemed fat and pudgy. They 
stared at the chair and its inmate, but Sam went 
quietly along. Here were German costumes sure 
enough. 

They turned up Second Street, and so around 

First Avenue, home. 

"Why, it's like going to foreign countries," 
Daisy said. "Some of the children were very 
pretty. But that Biddy Brady I can see her 
yet." 

The very next day Daisy drew two pictures, and 
held them before Hanny. 

" Why, that 's Biddy Brady ! " the little girl said, 
with a bright wondering laugh. " And that 's old 
Mrs. McGiven! They're splendid! How could 
you do it ? ' 

' I don't know. It came to me." 

Mrs. Craven said the old lady was excellent. 
And she laughed about Biddy Brady's dancing. 

Sometimes they went up to Tompkins' Square. 
They would study their lessons or do a bit of 
crocheting. Daisy was learning a great many 
things. Or they went a little farther up and over 
to the river, which was much wider at that time. 
The old farms had been cut up into blocks; but 
while they were waiting for some one to come 
along and build them up, the thrifty Germans had 
turned them into market gardens, and they pre- 
sented a very pretty appearance. 

They could see the small clusters of houses on 
Long Island, and the end of Blackwell's Island, - 
a terrible place to them. The boys had seen the 
"Black Maria," which the little girl thought must 
be some formidable giant negress capable of driv- 
ing the criminals along as one would a flock of 
sheep, and she was quite surprised when she 

 

learned it was a wagon merely. The East River 
was quite pretty up here, and the ferry-boats made 
a line of foam that sparkled in the sun. 

Occasionally Doctor Joe joined the party, and 
took them in other directions. He had accepted 
the offer of an old physician on East Broadway, 
which was then considered very aristocratic. The 
basement windows had pretty lace curtains, and 
the dining-rooms had beaufets in the corners, on 
which the glass and silver were arranged. The 
brass doorknobs and the name-plate shone like 
gold, and the iron railings of the stoops were 
finished with quite pretentious newels, that the 
children called sentry boxes. 

Grand Street, at the eastern end, had many 
private dwellings. Ridge and Pitt and Willet 
streets were quite steep and made splendid coast- 
ing places in winter. There was the Methodist 
church, in which many famous worthies had 
preached, and even at the end of the century the 
old place keeps its brave and undaunted front. 

Strawberries did not come until June; and the 
girls took them round the streets in tiny deep 
baskets. There were no such mammoth berries 
as we have now ; but, oh, how sweet and luscious 
they were! Little girls carried baskets of rad- 
ishes from door to door, and first you heard 
"strawbrees," then something that sounded like 
"ask arishee, " which I suppose was brief for "ask 
any radishes." 

The fish and clam men were a great delight to 
the children. One curious, weather-beaten old 





fellow who went through First Street had quite a 
musical horn, and a regular song. 

" Fine clams, fine clams, fine clams, to-day, 
That have just arrived from Rockaway. 
They 're good to boil, and they 're good to fry, 
And they 're good to make a clam pot-pie. 
My horse is hired, and my waggon isn't mine. 
Look out, little boys, don't cut behind ! " 

Where the rhyme was lame, he made up with an 
extra flourish and trill to the notes. The cats used 
to watch out for him. They seemed to know 
when Friday came, and they would be sitting on 
the front stoops, dozing until they heard the wel- 
come sound of the horn. There were huckster 
waggons with vegetables, and a buttermilk man. 

An old coloured woman used to come round with 
brewer's yeast, and one morning she had a great 
piece of black cambric twisted about her bonnet. 

"Who are you in mourning for, auntie? ' asked 
Margaret. 

"My ol' man, Miss Margret. Happened so 
lucky ! He jest died Sat'day night, an' we buried 
him on Sunday, an' here I am goin' round on 
Monday, not losin' any time. Happened so 
lucky ! " 

Jim went into spasms of merriment over the 
economy of the incident. 



CHAPTER III 

CHANCES AND CHANGES 

THE Whitneys had moved in May, to the great 
regret of everybody. Their family had changed 
considerably through the winter. Archibald, the 
younger son, was married, and Mr. Theodore had 
an opportunity to go abroad for a year. 

The widowed cousin in Beach Street was mar- 
ried and went to Baltimore with her two children. 
That left the two old aunts who owned the house 
quite alone. Mrs. Whitney and Delia had taken 
turns staying with them. 

The children were all sorry to lose Nora and 
Pussy Gray. 

" People say it 's bad luck to move a cat," said 
Nora, in her sententious fashion; "but we don't 
believe in it. We 've moved him twice already. 
And you just put a little butter on his feet- 

" Butter!' interrupted the children, amazed. 

"Why, yes. That's to make him wash his 
paws. If you can make him wash and purr in a 
new place, he will stay. And then you must 
take him round and show him every room and 
every closet. And you must come down real 
often, Hanny. There 's the lovely little park, 

 

you know. Aunt Boudinot has a key. They 're 
such nice queer old ladies, you 'll be sure to like 
them." 

" I don't always like queer people," said Hanny, 
rather affronted. 

"I don't mean cross or ugly. Aunt Clem has 
soft down all over her cheeks, and such curly 
white hair. She 's awful old and wrinkled and 
deaf; but Dele can make her hear splendid. 
Aunt Patty isn't so old. Her real name is 
Patricia. And Aunt Clem's is Clementine." 

The children were not alone in regret. Ben 
was almost broken-hearted to lose Mr. Theodore. 
The boy and the man had been such good friends. 
And Ben was quite resolved, when he had served 
his apprenticeship, and was twenty-one, to be a 
newspaper man and travel about the world. 

Delia had told them quite a wonderful secret 
the day she came up after some articles her mother 
had left. She had written some verses, and had 
them printed unknown to any one. The. had 
said they were very fair. And she had actually 
been paid for a story; and the editor of the paper 
offered to take others, if they were just as good. 
She had changed her check for a five-dollar gold- 
piece, which she carried about with her for luck. 
She showed it to them ; and they felt as if they had 
seen a mysterious object. 

Hanny was greatly amazed, puzzled as well. 
That a grown man like Mr. Theodore should 
write grave columns of business matters for a 
newspaper had not surprised her; she had a 

 

vague idea that people who wrote verses and 
stories must needs be lovely. She pictured them 
with floating curls and eyes turned heavenward 
for inspiration. It seemed to her that beautiful 
thoughts must come from the clouds. Then their 
voices should be soft, their hands delicate. And 
the divine something that no dictionary has ever 
yet found a word to describe must surround them. 
There was a fair-haired girl at school who had 
such an exquisite smile. And Daisy Jasper! 
For her to write verses would be the supreme 
fitness of things. 

But careless, laughing, untidy Dele Whitney, 
neither fair nor dark and yes, freckled, though 
her hair was more brown than red now. And to 
laugh about it, and toss up her goldpiece and 
catch it with her other hand! 

" Handsome ! ' ' Ben ejaculated when Hanny con- 
fided some of her difficulties to him in a very 
timid fashion. "Great people don't need to run 
to beauty. Still, Mr. Audubon had a lovely 
face, to my thinking," he added, when he saw 
how disappointed the little girl looked. 'And, 
oh ! see here, Mr. Willis is handsome and Gay- 
lord Clark, and there is that picture of Mrs. 
Hemans - 

The little girl smiled. Dr. Hoffman had 
given Margaret a beautifully bound copy of Mrs. 
Hemans's poems, and the steel engraving in the 
front was handsome. She had already learned 
two of the poems, and recited them at school. 

"And I don't think Delia so very plain," con- 

 

tinued Ben. "You just watch what beautiful 
curves there are to her lips, and her brown eyes 
lighten up like morning; and when they are a 
little sad, you can think that twilight over- 
shadows her. I like to watch them change so. 
I'm awfully sorry they're gone away. If we 
could have another big brother, I 'd like it to 
be Mr. Theodore." 

Hanny used to hope when she was as big as 
Margaret she would be as pretty. She didn't 
think very much about it, only now and then 
some of the cousins said, 

" Hanny doesn't seem to grow a bit. And how 
very light her hair keeps! You 'd hardly think 
she and Margaret were sisters." 

The little girls drew mysteriously closer after 
Nora went away. They all kept on at the same 
school, and played together. But dolls and tea 
parties didn't appear to have quite the zest of a 
year ago. 

One Saturday, Mr. Underhill took Hanny down 
to Beach Street. They were all delighted to see 
her, even to Pussy Gray, who came and rubbed 
against her, and stretched up until he reached her 
waist, and, oh, how he did purr ! 

"I think he 's been kind of homesick for the 
children," remarked Nora, gravely, as if she might 
be quite grown up. " You see he was spoiled 
among you all. I was a little afraid at first that 
he would run away. " 

'Did you put butter on his paws? ' 

"Oh, yes. He licked them, and then washed 

 

his face; but he kept looking around and listening 
to strange noises. He 'd sit on the window-sill 
and watch the children, and cry to go out. But 
he doesn't mind now. ' : 

He had a chair and a cushion to himself, and 
looked very contented. 

They went upstairs to see the old ladies. Aunt 
Clem had a round, full, baby face, for all she was 
so old. Nora said she was almost ninety. Aunt 
Patty was twenty years younger, quite brisk and 
bright, with wonderful blue eyes. They had the 
front room upstairs, and their bed stood in the 
alcove. The furnishing looked like some of 
the country houses. Mrs. Whitney had the back 
room, and Nora shared it with her. There were 
great pantries between with shelves and drawers, 
and in one a large chest, painted green, that Nora 
said was full of curiosities. 

Delia's room was up on the top floor. She had 
made it oddly pretty. There was a bookcase and 
the small desk The. had used, ever so many pic- 
tures, and a pot of flowers on a little table. It 
had quite an orderly aspect. 

"And I have another five-dollar goldpiece, " 
laughed the girl. " I shall be a nabob presently. 
I ought to invest my money; but it is so com- 
forting to look at, that I hate to let it go. ): 

Then Hanny had to tell them about the new 
neighbours. They were foreigners, by the name 
of Levy ; and there were four grown people, five 
little children, and two servants. Mr. Levy was 
an importer, and they all seemed jolly and noisy, 





but did not talk English, so there could not be 
any friendliness, even if they cared. 

"We shall soon be a foreign city," declared 
Mrs. Whitney. "It's astonishing how the for- 
eigners do come in ! No wonder people have to 
move up-town." 

Nora and Hanny went over in the Park after 
dinner. But it wasn't much fun to be alone; so 
they walked up and down the street, and then 
Delia took them in the stage down to the Battery. 
People were promenading in gala attire. Satur- 
day afternoon had quite a holiday aspect. There 
was a big steamer coming up the bay. The 
Whitneys had heard twice from Mr. Theodore, 
who was now going over to Ireland. 

"Tell Ben that The. is going to write to him," 
remarked Dele. "He said so in his last letter." 

When they returned to Beach Street, they found 
Doctor Joe waiting for Hanny. But Ben said 
afterward he wished he had gone instead, he was 
quite longing to see them all. And he was de- 
lighted with the prospect of a letter. 

Whether they would have liked their new neigh- 
bours or not, if they could have talked to them, 
made little difference to Mrs. Underbill. Mar- 
garet was to be married in the early autumn. Dr. 
Hoffman had bought a house not very far from 
Stephen's, in a new row that was just being finished. 
He wouldn't like it to stand empty, and he did 
not want to rent it for a year, and perhaps have 
the pretty fresh aspect spoiled. And then it was 
better for a doctor to be married and settled. 

 

Father Underbill sighed. Mrs. Underhill said 
sharply that she couldn't get ready ; but for all 
that, pieces of muslin came into the house for 
sheets and pillow-cases, and Margaret was busy 
as a bee. 

Another trouble loomed up before the anxious 
housekeeper. A sprightly widower belonging to 
the same church as Martha, came home with her 
every Sunday night, and class-meeting night, which 
was Thursday. 

" You ought to consider well," counseled Mrs. 
Underhill. " A stepmother is a sort of thankless 
office. And two big boys ! ' 

"Well I'm used to boys. They're not so 
bad when you know how to take them, and they 'll 
soon be grown up. Then he 's quite forehanded. 
He owns a house in Stanton Street, and has a 
good business, carting leather in the Swamp." 

The Swamp was the centre for tanneries and 
leather importers and dealers, and it still keeps 
its name and location. 

" I don't know what I shall do ! ' with a heavy 
sigh. 

" You 'll have good long warning. I wouldn't 
be mean enough to go off and leave you with all 
this fuss and worry on your hands. And, land 
sakes ! his wife hasn't been dead a year yet. I 
told him I couldn't think of such a thing before 
Christmas, anyhow. But he has such a hard time 
with both grandmothers. One comes and fixes 
things her way, and gets tired and goes off, and 
then the other one comes and upsets them. It's 


just dreadful ! I do believe a man needs a second 
wife more than he did the first. They 're poor 
sticks to get along alone when they 've had some 
one to look after things. And when this affair is 
over, you 'll kind of settle down, and the family 
seem smaller. Just don't fret a bit, for the whole 
thing may fall through." 

' I shouldn't want you to give up the prospect 
of a good home," rather reluctantly. 

" Well, that 's what I 've thought about. And I 
ain't a young girl with years of chances before 
me. But I 'm not going to be caught too easy," 
and Martha tossed her head. 

Ben was very much interested in the war that 
was going on now in good earnest. The Ameri- 
cans had taken Fort Brown, crossed to the Rio 
Grande and driven the Mexicans from Matamoras t 
A plan had been laid to attack Mexico on the 
Pacific side, and to invade both Old and New 
Mexico. Santa Anna had escaped from his exile 
in Cuba, and was longing to reconquer Texas. 
The whole question seemed in great confusion ; 
but there was a great deal of enthusiasm among 
some of the younger men, who thought war a 
rather heroic thing, and they were hurrying off to 
the scene of action. There was a spirit of adven- 
ture and curiosity about the wonderful western coast. 

George Horton used to talk all these matters 
over with Ben, when he came down on his occa- 
sional visits. He was a fine big fellow now, but 
he was getting tired of farming. It was quite 
lonely. Uncle Paid read the county paper, but 

 

was not specially interested in the questions of 
the day ; and Retty and her husband never went 
beyond stock, and the crops, and the baby. Ben 
kept his brother supplied with books that opened 
a wider outlook for him, and made him a little 
discontented with the humdrum round. 

" I wouldn't mind it if you were all there," he 
would say. " After all the city is the only real live 
place ! I 've half a mind to come down and learn 
a trade. Only I do like the wide out of doors. I 
couldn't stand being cooped up." 

" And I 'm going round the world some day," 
returned Ben. 

" I 'd like to go out with Fremont. The other 
side of our country seems so curious to me, I want 
to see what it is like. The other side of the 
Rocky Mountains ! It 's almost like saying the 
Desert of Sahara," and the young fellow laughed. 

There was the usual spring and summer dress- 
making for the ladies. Even Miss Cynthia, look- 
ing sharply at Hanny, said : 

" I don't see what 's the matter with that child ! 
I supposed she 'd have everything outgrown, and 
some of her last summer's skirts won't need any 
letting down. They 're wearing them shorter now ; 
and you know, Cousin Underbill, you would have 
them made rather long last summer." 

The little girl sometimes felt quite sore on the 
point. The Deans were getting to be tall girls, 
and even Daisy Jasper had taken to growing. 
And her lovely curls were quite long again. She 
certainly was very pretty.
