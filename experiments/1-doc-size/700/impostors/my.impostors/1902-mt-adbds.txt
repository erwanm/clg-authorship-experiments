Looky here — he ain't no fool, boys' 
"No, sir! Why, great Scott—" 
But Stillman was resuming: 
" While we were out yonder an hour 
or two ago, the owner of the gimlet 
and the trial-candle took them from a 
place where he had concealed them — 
it was not a good place — and carried 
them to what he probably thought 
was a better one, two hundred yards 
up in the pine woods, and hid them 
there, covering them over with pine 
needles. It was there that I found 
them. The gimlet exactly fits the 
hole in the barrel. And now — " 

The Extraordinary Man interrupted 
him. He said, sarcasticall} : 

"We have had a very pretty fairy- f 
tale, gentlemen — very pretty indeed.  

Now I would like to ask this young 
man aquSlibrr orirwrT'*' 

Some of the boys winced, and Fer- 
guson said, 

" Tm afraid Archy's going to catch 
it now' 

The others lost their smiles and 
sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: 

"Let us proceed to examine into 
this fairy-tale in a consecutive and 
orderly way — by geometrical pro- 
gression, so to speak — linking detail 
to detail in a steadily advancing and 
remorselessly consistent and unassail- 
able march upon this tinsel toy-fortress 
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow 
imagination. To begin with, young 
sir, I desire to ask you but three ques- 
tions at present — at present. Did I 
understand you to say it was your 

The opinion that the supposititious candle 
test was lighted at about eight o'clock 

yesterdaj'' evening?'' 
"Yes, sir — about eight." 
"Could you say exactly eight?" 
"Well, no, I couldn't be that ex- 
act." 

" Um. If a person had been passing 
along there just about that time, he 
would have been almost sure to en- 
counter that assassin, do you think?" 
"Yes, I should think so." 
"Thank you, that is all. For the 
present. I say, all for the present." 


" Dern himl he's laying for Archy," 
said Ferguson. 

"It's so' said Ham Sandwich. 
"I don't like the look of it." 

Stillman said, glancing at the guest, 

''I was along there myself at half 

 On the past eight — no, about nine." spot 

"In-deed? This is interesting — this 
is very interesting. Perhaps you en- 
countered the assassin yourself?" 

"No, I encoimtered no one." 

"Ah. Then — if you will excuse 
the remark — I do not quite see the 
relevancy of the information." 

"It has none. At present. I say 
it has none — at present." He paused. 
Presently he resumed: "I did not en- 
counter the assassin, but I am on his 
track, I am sure, for I believe he is in 
this room. I will ask you all to pass 
one by one in front of me — here, where 
there is a good light — so that I can 
see your feet' 

A buzz of excitement swept the 
place, and the march began, the guest 
looking on with an iron attempt at 
gravity which was not an unqualified 
success. Stillman stooped, shaded 
his eyes with his hand, and gazed 
down intently at each pair of feet as 
it passed. Fifty men tramped monot- 
onously by — with no result. Sixty. 
Seventy. The thing was beginning 
to look absurd. The guest remarked, 
with suave irony, 

"Assassins appeal to be scar ce 
this evening." 

The house saw the humor of it, and 


refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. 
Ten or twelve more candidates tramped 
by — no, danced by, with airy and 
ridiculous capers which convulsed the 
spectators — then suddenl} Stillman 
put out his hand and said, 

" This is the assassin !" 
" Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhe- 
drim!'' roared the crowd; and at once 
let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and 
dazzle and confusion of stirring re- 
marks inspired by the situation. 

At the height of the turmoil the 
guest stretched out his hand, com- 
manding peace. The authority of a 
great name and a great personality 
laid its mysterious compulsion upon 
the house, and it obeyed. Out of the 
panting calm which succeeded, the 
guest spoke, saying, with dignity 
and feeling: 

"This is serious. It strikes at an 
innocent life. Innocent beyond sus- 
picion! Innocent beyond perad vent- 
ure! Hear me prove it; observe how 
simple a fact can brush out of existence 
this witless lie. Listen. My friends, 
that lad was never out of my sight 
yesterday~evenTng at any time \" 

It made a deep impression. Men 
turned their eyes upon Stillman with 
grave inquiry in them. His face 
brightened, and he said, 

"I knew there was another one!" 
He stepped briskly to the table and 
glanced at the guest's feet, then up at 
his face, and said: "You were with 
him! You were not fifty steps from 

him when he lit the candle that by- 
and-by fired the powder .' (Sensor 
tion.) "And what is more, you furnished 
the matches yourself!'' matches 

plainly the guest seemed hit; it 
looked so to the public. He opened 
his mouth to speak; the words did 
not come freely. 

'' This — er — this is insanity — 
this—" 

Stillman pressed his evident ad- 
vantage home. He held up a charred 
match. 

''Here is one of them. I found it 
in the barrel — and there's another one 
there." 

The guest foimd his voice at once. 

"Yes — and put them there your- 
self." 


It was recognized as a good shot 
Stillman retorted: 

''It is wax — a breed unknown to 
this camp. I am ready to be searched 
for the box. Are you?" 

The guest was staggered this time 
— the dullest eye could see it. He 
fumbled with his hands ; once or twice 
his lips moved, but the words did not 
come. The house waited and watched, 
in tense suspense, the stillness adding 
effect to the situation. Presently Still- 
man said, gently, 

"We are waiting for your decision." 

There was silence again during 
several moments; then the guest an- 
swered, in a low voice, 

" I refuse to be searched." 

There was no noisy demonstration
but all about the house one voice 
after another muttered: 
"That settles it He's Archy's Arch's 
meat." 

What to do now? Nobody seemed 
to know. It was an embarrassing 
situation for the moment — merely, of 
course, because matters had taken 
such a sudden and unexpected turn 
that these unpractised minds were 
not prepared for it, and had come to a 
standstill, like a stopped clock, under 
the shock. But after a little the ma- 
chinery began to work again, tenta- 
tively, and by twos and threes the 
men put their heads together and 
privately buzzed over this and that 
and the other proposition. One of 
these propositions met with much fa- 
ingthe '» it was, to conf er upon the assassin 
assassin   q£ thanks for removing Flint 
Buclmer, and let him go. Butthe 
cooler heads opposed it, pointing out 
that addled brains in tHeEastern 
States would pronounce it a scandal, 
and make no end of foolish noise 
about it. In the end the cool heads 
got the upper hand, and obtained 
general consent to a proposition of 
their own, and their leader then called 
the house to order and stated it — to 
this effect: that Fetlock Jones be 
jailed and put upon his trial. 

The motion was carried. Appar- 
ently there was nothing further to do 
now, and the people were glad, for, 
privately, they were impatient to get 
out and rush to the scene of the trag- 
edy, and see whether that barrel and 
the other things were really there or 
not. 

But no— the break-up got a check. 
The surprises were not over yet. For 
a while Fetlock Jones had been silent- 
ly sobbing, unnoticed in the absorb- 
ing excitements which had been fol- 
lowing one another so persistently 
for some time; but when his arrest 
and trial were decreed, he broke out 
despairingly, and said : 

"No! it's no use. I don't want 
any jail, I don't want any trial; I've 
had all the hard luck I want, and all 
the miseries. Hang me now, and let 
me out! It would all come out, any- 
way — there couldn't anjhing save 
me. He bas told it all, just as if he'd 
been with me and seen it — I don't

know how he found out; and you 
find the barrel and things, and then I 
The wouldn't have any chance any more. 

sl' I killed him; and you'd have done 
it too, if he'd treated you like a dog, 
and you only a boy, and weak and 
poor, and not a friend to help you." 

"And served him damned well 
right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. 
"Looky here, boys—" 

From the constable: "Order! Or- 
der, gentlemen!" 

A voice: "Did your uncle know 
what you was up to?" 

"No, he didn't." 

"Did he give you the matches, 
sure enough?" 



"Yes, he did; but he didn't know 
what I wanted them for' 

" When you was out on such a busi- 
ness as that, how did you venture to 
risk having him along — and him a 
detective? How's that?" 

The boy hesitated, fumbled with 
his buttons in an embarrassed way, 
then said, shyly. 


"I know about detectives, on account 
of having them in the family; 
and if you don't want them to find 
out about a thing, it's best to have 
them around when you do it." 

The cyclone of laughter which 
greeted this naive discharge of wis- 
dom did not modify the poor little 
waif's embarrassment in any large 
degree. 




From a Letter to Mrs. Stillman, Dated 
merely "Tuesday." 

ETLOCK JONES was 
put under lock and key 
in an unoccupied log 
cabin, and left there to 
await his trial. Constable Harris 
provided him with a couple of days' 
rations, instructed him to keep a 
good guard over himself, and prom- 
ised to look in on him as soon as 
further supplies should be due. 
Next morning a score of us went 

with Hillyer, out of friendship, and 
helped him bury his late relative, the 
unlaniented Buckner, and I acted as 
first assistant pall-bearer, Hillyer act- 
ing as chief. Just as we had finished 
our labors a ragged and melancholy 
stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, 
limped by with his head down, and I 
caught the scent I had chased around 
the globe. It was the odor of Para- 
dise to my perishing hopel 

In a moment I was at his side and 
had laid a gentle hand upon his shoul- 
der. He slumped to the ground as 
if a stroke of lightning had withered 
him in his tracks; and as the boys 
came running he struggled to his 
knees and put up his pleading hands 
to me, and out of his chattering jaws 
he begged me to persecute him no 
more, and said, 

"You have hunted me around the 
world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God is 
my witness I have never done any 
man harm!" 

A glance at his wild eyes showed 

' us that he was insane. That was 
msane 

my work, mother! The tidings of 
your death can some day repeat the 
misery I felt in that moment, but noth- 
ing else can ever do it. The boys 
Hfted him up, and gathered about 
him, and were full of pity of him, and 
said the gentlest and touchingest 
things to him, and said cheer up and 
don't be troubled, he was among 
friends now, and they would take 
care of him, and protect him, and hang 
and man that laid a hand on him. 
They are just Uke so many mothers, 
the rough mining -camp boys are, 
when you wake up the south side of 
their hearts; yes, and just like so 
many reckless and unreasoning chil- 
dren when you wake up the opposite 
side of that muscle. They did every- 
thing they could think of to comfort 
him, but nothing succeeded imtil Wells- 
Fargo Ferguson, who is a clever strat- 
egist, said, 

"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's 
troubling you, you needn't worry any 
more." 

"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, 
eagerly. 

"Because he's dead again." 

"Deadl Dead ! Oh, don't trifle 

with a poor wreck like me. Is he 
dead? On honor, now — is he telling 
me true, boys?'' 

"True as you're a-standing therel" 
said Ham Sandwich, and they all 
backed up the statement in a body. 

"They himg him in San Bernar- 
fff dino last week," added Ferguson, 

by mistake clinching the matter,
"whilst he was 

searching around after you. Mis- 
took him for another man. They're 
sorry, but they can't help it now." 

"They're a-building him a monu- 
ment," said Ham Sandwich, with the 
air of a person who had contributed 
to it, and knew. 

"James Walker" drew a deep sigh 
— evidently a sigh of relief — and said 
nothing; but his eyes lost something 
in their wildness, his countenance 
cleared visibly, and its drawn look 
relaxed a little. We all went to our 
cabin, and the boys cooked him the Soothing 
best dinner the camp could furnish 
the materials for, and while they 
were about it Hillyer and I outfitted 
him from hat to shoe-leather with 
new clothes of ours, and made a come- 
ly and presentable old gentleman of 
him. "Old" is the right word, and 
a pity, too; old by the droop of him, 
and the frost upon his hair, and the 
marks which sorrow and distress have 
left upon his face; though he is only 
in his prime in the matter of years. 
While he ate, we smoked and chatted ; 
and when he was finishing he found 
his voice at last, and of his own
accord broke out with his personal 
history. I cannot furnish liis exact 
words, but I will come as near it as I 
can. 

It happened like this : I was in Den- 
ver. I had been there many years; 
sometimes I remember how many, 
sometimes I don't — but it isn't any 
matter. All of a sudden I got a notice 
to leave, or I would be exposed for a 
horrible crime committed long before 
— \ears and years before — in the East. 
I knew about that crime, but I was 
not the criminal; it was a cousin of 
mine of the same name. What should 
I better do? My head was all dis- 
ordered by fear, and I didn't know. 



I was allowed very little time — only 
one day, I think it was. I would be 
ruined if I was published, and the

people would lynch me, and not be- "' 

lieve what I said. It is always the 
way with lynchings; when they find 
out it is a mistake they are sorry, 
but it is too late, — the same as it was 
with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said 
I would sell out and get money to live 
on, and run away until it blew over 
and I could come back with my proofs. 
Then I escaped in the night and went 
a long way off in the mountains some- 
where, and lived disguised and had a 
false name. 

I got more and more troubled and 
worried, and my troubles made me see 
spirits and hear voices, and I could 
not think straight and clear on any 
subject, but got confused and involved 
gmd had to give it up, because my 
head hurt so. It got to be worse and 
worse; more spirits and more voices. 
They were about me all the time; at 
first only in the night, then in the 
day too. They were always whis- 
pering around my bed and plotting 
against me, and it broke my sleep 
and kept me fagged out, because I 
got no good rest. 

And then came the worst. One 
night the whispers said, "We'll never 
manage, because we can't see him, and 
so canH point him out to the people." 

They sighed; then one said: "We 
must bring Sherlock Holmes. He 
can be here in twelve days." 


They all agreed, and whispered and 
jibbered with joy. But my heart 
broke; for I had read about that man, FUeing 

and knew what it would be to have Sherhck 
him upon my track, with his super- 
human penetration and tireless ener- 
gies. 

The spirits went away to fetch him, 
and I got up at once in the middle of 
the night and fled away, carrying 
nothing but the hand-bag that had 
my money in it — thirty thousand dol- 
lars; two-thirds of it are in the bag 
there yet. It was forty days before 
that man caught up on my track. I 
just escaped. From habit he had 
written his real name on a tavern 
register, but had scratched it out and 
written "Dagget Barclay" in the 

place of it. But fear gives you a 
watchful eye and keen, and I read 
the true name through the scratches, 
and fled like a deer. 
He has hunted me all over this 
Hunted world for three years and a half — 

for years the Pacific States, Australasia, India 

— everywhere you can think of; then 
back to Mexico and up to California 
again, giving me hardly any rest; 
but that name on the registers always 
saved me, and what is left of me is 
alive yet. And I am so tired I A 
cruel time he has given me, yet I give 
you my honor I have never harmed 
him nor any man. 

That was the end of the story, and 
it stirred those boys to blood-heat, 
reproach be sure of it. As for me— each word 
burnt a hole in me where it struck. 

We voted that the old man should 
bunk with us, and be my guest and 
Hillyer's. I shall keep my own coun- 
sel, naturally; but as soon as he is Cr, 
well rested and nourished, I shall 
take him to Denver and rehabilitate 
his fortunes. 

The boys gave the old fellow the 
bone-mashing good-fellowship hand- 
shake of the mines, and then scattered 
away to spread the news. 

At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo 
Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called 
us softly out, and said, privately : 

"That news about the way that 
old stranger has been treated has 
spread all around, and the camps 
are up. They are piling in from 
everywhere, and are going to Ijnich 
the P'fessor. Constable Harris is in 
a dead funk, and has telephoned the 
sheriff. Come along!" 

We started on a run. The others 
were privileged to feel as they chose, 
"r k "  " heart's privacy I hoped 
« the sheriff would arrive in time, for I 

had small desire that Sherlock Holmes 
should hang for my deeds, as you can 
easily believe. I had heard a good 
deal about the sheriff, but for reas- 
surance' sake I asked, 

" Can he stop a mob?'' 

"Can he stop a mob I Can Jack 
Fairfax stop a mob! Well, I should 
smile ! Ex-desperado — nineteen scalps 
on his string. Can he I Oh, I say " 



As we tore up the gulch, distant 
cries and shouts and yells rose faintly 
on the still air, and grew steadily in 
strength as we raced along. Roar 
after roar burst out, stronger and 
stronger, nearer and nearer; and at 
last, when we closed up upon the mul- 
titude massed in the open area in 
front of the tavern, the crash of sound 
was deafening. Some brutal roughs 
from Daly's Gorge had Holmes in 
their grip, and he was the calmest 
man there; a contemptuous smile 
played about his lips, and if any fear 
of death was in his British heart, his 
iron personality was master of it, and 
no sign of it was allowed to appear. 

" Come to a vote, men!" This from 
one of the Daly gang, Shadbelly 
Higgins. "Quick I is it hang, or 
shoot?" 

"Neither I'' shouted one of his com- 
rades. "He'd be aHve again in a 
 week; burning's the only permanency 

for him." 

The gangs from all the outlying 
camps burst out in a thunder-crash of 
approval, and went struggling and 
surging toward the prisoner, and 
closed around him, shouting, "Firel 
fire's the ticket !" They dragged him 
to the horse-post, backed him against 
it, chained him to it, and piled wood 
and pine cones around him waist-deep. 
Still the strong face did not blench, 
and still the scornful smile played 
about the thin lips. 

"A match I fetch a match!" 

Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with 
his hand, stooped, and held it under 
a pine cone. A deep silence fell upon FunerMi 
the mob. The cone caught, a tiny p 

flame flickered about it a moment or 
two. I seemed to catch the soimd 
of distant hoofs — it grew more dis- 
tinct — still more and more distinct, 
more and more definite, but the ab- 
sorbed crowd did not appear to no- 
tice it. The match went out. The 
man struck another, stooped, and 
again the flame rose; this time it 
took hold and began to spread— here 
and there men turned away their 
faces. The executioner stood with 
the charred match in his fingers, 
watching his work. The hoof-beats 
turned a projecting crag, and now 
they came thundering down upon 
us. Almost the next moment there 
was a shout — 

"The sheriff !" 



And straightway he came tearing 
into the midst, stood his horse ahnost 
on his hind feet, and said, 

"Fall back, you gutter-snipes !'' 

He was obeyed. By all but their 
leader. He stood his ground, and his 
hand went to his revolver. The sher- 
iff covered him promptly, and said : 

"Drop your hand, you parlor-des- 
perado. Kick the fire away. Now
