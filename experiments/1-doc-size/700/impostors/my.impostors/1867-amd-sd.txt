came up and flooded the room with its cold, pale light. 
Sometimes a fiery flash of fever tortured, her, then a 
chill, that nearly froze the blood in her veins. It 
seemed to her she lived ages in that one night. 

Joe sat by the fire. In her confused and wandering 
way she was trying to unravel the tangled web, and see 
who was right. Just now she loved Stephen with a 
sort of tigerish fierceness. To see another woman his, 
to have him lavish caresses upon her, to be put aside 
completely, was what she could not endure. Pity her, 
too. Life is so hard to some of us, and love is cruel. 

Two very strange days passed over them. They 
made talk of common occurrences ; they went through 
with their ordinary duties ; but one subject was not 
touched upon. They avoided each other's eyes, and 
somehow both came to have a guilty feeling, as if they 
were about some crime. 

On the third day Hope did not go to school as usual. 
At ten, after spending an hour in her room, she came 
down in her thick gray dress. There was a stony, 
settled expression in her face, a sinking of the lines 
about the mouth, and a dark shade under the eyes. 
Even her voice had changed. 




 

" Joe," she began, with a hollow, tremulous sound, 
"are you well enough to go out for a walk? It's a 
lovely day." 

It was bright and sunny. 

" I could." Joe glanced up wistfully. Why ? " 

"Don't ask me any questions, please. It is best for 
you not to know anything. Don't tell Stephen of our 
talk. Comfort him all you can, and make him forget 
me. And now put on your bonnet and go out for an 
hour. Just let me kiss you once. You have been so 
kind to me ! I want you to forgive me for all the pain 
and suffering I've cause'd you. I know now what it is." 

But the kiss ended in sobs. Since that fatal night 
Hope had been too deeply stunned for tears. They 
both wept. 

"O, Hope," Joe's voice was broken and repentant, 
" stay. Don't go. I'll give up all claim on Stephen. 
He may love you ; he may devote his whole life to you, 
and I'll look on, never saying a word. Only stay." 

"It isn't that, Joe. It's the insurmountable barrier 
God placed between us. I should make Stephen mis- 
erable if I staid." 

"But what will you do? " 

w It is best you should not know. At present I am 
provided for. I shall never do anything for which you 
or Stephen would be sorry. I cannot tell you more 
than that. Now you must go." 

Joe gave her a wild, beseeching look. Hope was the 



 

stronger. She brought Joe's shawl and bonnet, wrapped 
her with tender care, led her through the hall, and gave 
her one convulsive kiss. When the door closed, Hope 
groped her way back as if she had been blind. For a 
moment the whole sacrifice appeared useless. And then 
the room seemed to run with seas of crimson blood. 
A sick shudder crept over her. 

Presently, a hackman drove up to the door. Katy 
came in wide-eyed wonder. 

"You're not goin' away, Miss Hope?" 

"Yes. I want you to give this to Miss Joe, and this 
to Mr. Dane when he comes home," and she handed 
her a little packet. 

"You'm not goin' to 'lope?" and Katy started in 
affright. 

The man had brought down her trunk. She gave 
Katy's black hand a fond, lingering squeeze, uttered a 
broken good-by, and before Katy could recover herself, 
the hack dashed away. She went back to the kitchen, 
talking out her astonishment with herself. 

On Joe's return, she brought the two notes ; but Joe 
was in no condition to talk. Now that the step had 
been taken, a wild consternation filled every pulse. She 
looked helplessly at Katy ; she stretched out her hands 
in a strange terror ; the whole world seemed drifting 
away. She tried to call on Hope, on Stephen, but her 
tongue was paralyzed. And then came darkness, 
peace. 



 

Stephen's business being ended sooner than he ex- 
pected, he hurried home, eager to see Hope, his brain 
filled with delicious visions. He found Joe in the 
stupor of fever, quite unconscious, and a note from 
Hope that gave him a shock half depriving him of his 
faculties. He had found Joe's also, and read it. Hope 
had worded it so carefully that no one could have 
suspected Joe of being aware of her intentions. 

To Stephen she said she had been studying her own 
heart, and found that becoming his wife was an impossi- 
bility. She was sorry for having misled him, but she 
had not then known her true feelings. She begged him 
to forget her she was not worth his remembrance. 
He had performed a more than friend's duty towards 
her, and she implored him to believe her grateful. It 
would be useless to search for her, she said, as, if he 
found her, a return would be quite out of the question. 
The whole tone of the note was curt and cold. It 
pained Stephen cruelly. That to Joe was so tender ! 

Poor Hope ! Her heart had well nigh broken over 
them both. If she had said to Stephen half of what she 
longed to, she could never have gone away. In her rare 
delicacy she could not humiliate him by even hinting at 
his secret. And so she had guarded every word, been 
cold when her whole seul was overflowing with love, 
precise and formal when every nerve was in a wild rack 
of anguish. More than once she had paused in the 



 

writing, and believed herself unable to proceed, until an 
inexorable fate goaded her on. 

For a fortnight Josephine Dane's senses were closed to 
all outward events. Occasionally she was restless ; but 
then she would only wring her hands and exclaim in 
pathetic tones, " O, dear ! O, dear ! " The rest of the 
time she lay in a stupor, taking what they gave her, but 
never returning the least sign of recognition. Stephen 
watched over her with a strange, yearning love, such as 
one gives to a helpless child. And for some reason he 
was doubly anxious to have her live. 

What the soul passed through in that time poor Joe 
never remembered, and perhaps it was as well. There 
are some awful secrets in nature that it is not wise to 
penetrate. A confused, troublous pain was all the im- 
pression she had, until one day she opened her eyes, 
sadly weak, but with a clear vision. This was her 
room. By degrees the furniture grew familiar. Oppo- 
site there, by the window, sat a placid woman, past 
middle life, her soft brown hair gathered under a plain 
cap, her face sweet and patient. She was sewing slow- 
ly, pausing now and then to glance out on the street. 
Through the window floated a quivering haze of golden 
sunshine. Beyond, the blue sky bounded all. 

Joe drew a long breath. So heavenly peaceful ! If 
she could lie there forever at rest but she had a vague 
idea that there was something else to her life. A pain 
and dreariness, a want that could not be satisfied. 



 

Then she wondered how it would be to die. Was 
God as kind and pitiful as they said? Did He take 
poor, wearied souls in His arms, and whisper over them 
some words of everlasting peace? For life was thorny. 
Rose-lined paths were but for few. None had ever blos- 
somed in her way. And then she asked the vague ques- 
tion we all ask at some time, why she had been born 
at all. 

Presently old memories began to throng about her. 
Had Hope come from school yet? Ah ! what was this 
sharp pang? Was Hope going away? What did they 
say that night? Perhaps Stephen had found her. 

By degrees Joe recalled all, just as if she had fallen, 
asleep yesterday, and wakened this morning. The sun 
was going over westward ; so it could not be morning. 
And why was this strange woman here ? 

She saw the light fading out, but asked no question. 
She did not even stir, until a step in the hall roused her. 
A light tap at the door, which was opened immediately 
afterwards, and some one came to her bedside. The 
woman by the window rose, and put aside her sewing. 

Joe held out her hand, though, for the weak tears in 
her eyes, she could not see. But through her pale lips 
trembled the word, " Stephen ! " 

" Dear Joe ! " He bent over and kissed her tenderly. 

"How long have I been sick?" she asked. 



 

"Nearly three weeks. But you are improving now; 
have been for several days." 

" Have you found her, Stephen ? " 

There was a convulsive pressure of Joe's hand, and 
the strong man swayed almost as if he would have 
fallen. 

" I have not searched." 

w Why ? " A mortal terror seized Joe. 

" Some day you shall know. It was her own wish. 
You are too weak to be excited by it now." 

No. What did you think ? " 

"Katy suggested, it was wild, I know ; but did you 
ever dream she cared for some one, that she went 
away with him ? " 

Should she let him believe it? 

" You had no quarrel ? But I need not ask. I saw 
her note to you. And Katy told me she went in your 
absence. We must learn to do without her, though God 
knows we shall miss her sorely." 

" Are you talking to her ? " interposed the nurse. 

" She has recognized me, Mrs. Beswick. She is really 
better." 

w The doctor, you know, was afraid of excitement." 

" It will not injure me. I shall get well." 

Stephen noticed how inexpressibly dreary the tone 
was, how utterly devoid of hope ; and it pained him to 
the heart. They must be more to each other now, since 



 

the one who could have been so much to both was 
gone. 

Joe recovered slowly. April came up with her bland 
airs and wooing sunshine. A faint suggestion of south- 
ern bloom stealing through the lattice, trees swelling 
with their buds, and a stray bird now and then piping 
his lay in a tender voice. What cared she for them all ? 
What was bird, or bee, or sunshine to her ? 

Never had Stephen been so tender. It might be love, 
but not the kind that dwelt in his sad eyes, dimly shad- 
owed forth, for another. She remembered many springs 
agone, when this fear had first seized her, how she 
had watched that shady light come and go, and learned 
too surely that he was drifting away from her. Why 
had she not ceased to love him? ah, why? When God 
made a woman's heart hungry for love, did he mean it 
should go forever unsatisfied? 

By degrees matters' resumed their olden course. Mrs. 
Beswick went away ; Joe was able to go up arid down 
stairs, to ride out, and indulge in an occasional walk. 
Katy petted and scolded her as if she were a child. She 
seemed so weak and dependent now that she was glad to 
have some one stronger, on whom she could lean. 

The first surprise and grief occasioned by Hope's de- 
parture had worn off. Katy was garrulous, to be sure, 
and from her Joe learned all that she had missed of 
Stephen's sorrow. The fond old servant was loud in 



 

her lamentations, and stubborn in her faith that Hope 
had gone off with some gallant young lover. Joe feebly 
said, "I don't think it, Katy. No one ever came to the 
house that she seemed interested in, or for whom she 
cared." But Katy still persisted. She had imbued 
Stephen with this belief, because there was no other that 
could account so well, not only for the young girl's de- 
parture, as for the coldness of her note. Joe's dan- 
gerous illness at this period had roused his fears and 
sympathies in another direction, and perhaps prevented 
his yielding to the passionate grief that might otherwise 
have absorbed him. 

The shock had brought him back to his olden self 
caused him to think of all that lay between. Had he 
any real right to Hope's love? Was there not a curse 
upon his very life, a stain that could never be washed 
away ? She did not know this ; but all unconsciously 
she had become an avenger in the hands of God. And 
since he could not contest this judgment, Stephen Dane 
bowed his head.

XI. 

SAD HEAKTS. 

A SLOW-PASSING summer full of sweets. A 
quiet house, just as if some one had been carried 
forth for burial. A yearning and a longing for a pres- 
ence that came not never would again, they both said, 
fearfully, to themselves. 

They had fallen into a strange manner of living. Both 
were reserved, though not from any feeling of pride or 
selfishness. Indeed, it was a peculiar state, brought 
about by a peculiar combination. No explanation had 
ever passed between them. It may appear strange, yet 
you will sometimes know of two people living together 
through months of silence, because the right moment 
passed without the needed words being spoken, and no 
other ever came. 

Stephen fancied at first that Joe might know more 
of Hope's heart than he had learned. But all mention 
of her departure distressed Joe so greatly, that, from 
natural kindliness, he resolved to avoid it. Each day 
it seemed to her she was growing more positively afraid 



, 

of Stephen. She understood, in a vague way, that it 
was Hope who had drawn them nearer together, who 
had rounded the sharp points of each nature, and soft- 
ened the asperities, rendering home such a bright, en- 
chanting place. There was no one now to make them 
laugh with gay little sallies ; no one to sing through 
summer twilights ; no soft arms to steal around her 
neck, the little hands clasping to make a rest for her 
chin. " Dear Joe, you are so kind ! " How many times 
she had heard the words ! Nothing now to break this 
chilling, awful dread that threw its shadow over the 
house. 

If Joe had recovered her full strength and sturdiness ; 
if she could have gone to the stores and to market ; 
cheapened tradesmen and scolded huckster women ; 
swept the house and weeded the garden, she might 
have regained her spirits in some degree. Instead, 
everything was a burden. She was glad to have Katy 
relieve her. Some mornings she felt so weary that she 
did not come down until after Stephen had breakfasted 
and gone. Then she idled about, dusting the library 
and parlor, sat down by the open windows, and gazed 
vacantly at the fur-off, luminous sky. Was there One 
there who knew what she needed, and would take pity 
on her? She was so tired with this endless, tangled 
mass of thought. She was so pained with Stephen's 
sad face. If she had not told Hope ! 

Consequently, after the first improvement, she fell 



 

into a hopeless, apathetical state, growing thinner and 
paler, and so unlike the Joe of other days. Stephen 
took her to the sea-side ; the air was too strong, and made 
her cough ; then to pretty inland resorts ; but nothing 
roused her. She was no great lover of nature ; she had 
few resources of her own for such a period as this. At 
times even Stephen's generous care fretted her, and she 
was cold and ungracious, when her heart was almost 
breaking with pity and remorse. 

And Stephen, unable to read her heart, bore patiently 
with her, his own heavy enough. There was with him 
no lack of subjects for thought. Almost daily he went 
over the past, looking at its blackness, its foul deeds, 
and abhorring himself in the deepest humiliation. Yet 
where could he have made one step different ? A strange 
fate had led him on, had compelled him, as it were, to 
bear other burdens than his own. But the most pain- 
ful of all to him was his utter inability to make restitu- 
tion. He fancied at times, because he had dared to love 
Hope, God had set this seal upon his punishment 
never to know how she fared, or what she might be 
called upon to suffer. He fairly hated the gold that 
flowed in upon him so lavishly. He dispensed it with 
so free a hand that friends were filled with wonder. 

He had made some effort to find Hope, in spite of her 
request. Not to see her, but to make over to her the 
portion that was so truly hers. He had supposed she 
would go to New York, but all search there proved 



 

fruitless. So there was nothing but endurance, and 
that is always doubly hard when the light of faith has 
died out, as it had with him. 

As I said, it was a dreary summer, for all its bloom, 
and richness, and the variety Stephen was fain to give 
it. Sometimes it almost seemed to him as if Joe moped 
in sullen perverseness, and it was difficult to preserve 
his own equanimity. 

A woman with a different nature could not have 
hidden her secret so effectually. I question if Joe could, 
under other circumstances. There were times when she 
resolved to tell Stephen ; but in their more confidential 
moments, some wretched indecision held her back. For 
there was to Joe a strange, awful fear, that chilled her very 
soul, an almost presentiment if you will, that in a little 
time neither love nor hate would matter much, to her. 

One August afternoon she went out for a ramble. 
The air in the house seemed stifling her ; the quiet street, 
with its infrequent passengers, was lonelier than a desert. 
The air had been cooled by a shower the preceding even- 
ing, and w r as fresh and fragrant with the peculiar ripeness 
of the later summer. Chirping birds, droning bees, 
and bright winged flies flitted about. A pleasant river 
sound broke on her ear from the not distant Schuylkill. 
Boats skimming the water the plash of oars, or the 
whirl of a brisk little wheel, scattering the spray in every 
direction. How often she and Hope had sat on the 
deck, and watched the green shores as they glided by ! 



 

A sound broke on her ear the toll of a bell. Slow 
and solemn, falling on this clear air, and being carried 
inconceivable distances, dying sadly out at length over 
the river. Was some human soul passing over another 
river ? If a day came when the bells should toll in this 
manner for her ? 

Joe shuddered. We all cling to life, and are filled 
with dread in such moments as these, when the awful 
realities are thrust before our vision. 

Turning a corner, she saw at the end of the street a 
little chapel. She had heard of the place, but had never 
been there. The street was shady and cool ; so she 
wandered on, listening to the slow sound, and thinking 
some "vague and troubled thoughts. A few persons 
entered the churchyard gate from time to time ; then 
the hearse and carriages came up, and Joe quickened 
her pace. 

The clergyman walked down the aisle in his white 
robe a young man with a reverent air. His rich, 
deep voice broke the solemn stillness with that most 
glorious of all passages from Holy Writ, 

"lam the resurrection and the life" 

Was it the tone, or the words, or the scene? 
Josephine Dane fell on her knees in the obscure corner 
she had slipped into, and remained there all through the 
service. She was not weeping, although she strained 
her fingers so tightly over her eyes; she was hardly 
listening. She heard the words like one in a dream, 



 

and was guided more by the impression they made upon 
her, than any distinct power inherent in them. A 
woman this was, for whom the burial service was being 
said. Husband and children were there. A happy 
woman, a woman beloved. O, why had not God 
taken her instead? Of what avail was her poor, 
starved, miserable life ! 

The clergyman headed the procession again as it 
moved out of church. Such a kindly, pitying face ! If 
it would turn once upon her ! 

It did a brief glance, a sort of startled, questioning 
look. And then Joe bowed her head again until they 
had all passed, and the last footfall died away on the 
gravel path outside. She was so weak and weary, it 
seemed at first as if she could never get home again. 

It was quite late, and Stephen sat on the porch, under 
the swinging vines. 

"Joe," he said, softly, "you have walked too far." 

His tone unnerved her. She tottered a little, but he 
caught her in his arms held her there a moment while 
a sort of convulsive sob shook her. 

" Poor Joe ! If I could do anything to make you 
well and happy ! You have never been like yourself 
since she went away." 

He had scarcely uttered Hope's name since her 
departure. 

There had been a time when one word from Stephen 
Dane could have made Joe both well and happy. Xow 



 

it was too late. Only God's cure for burdened souls 
could ever bring peace to hers. 

It is so strange to come upon one day in our lives 
when we begin to feel the things of earth slipping away, 
and cease to care. We hold ourselves almost in awe. 

" No," Joe repeated, vacantly, " I have never been 
myself since then." 

" If I could find her for your sake." 

"For your own, Stephen. I shall not need any one 
long." 

A wandering color flushed his face, and his whole 
frame quivered. 

" You are low spirited, Joe. But you are not re- 
covering, as I hoped. If I could find her! She is 
another's perhaps, but she would come to you." 

"She is not another's, I know. I sent her away. 
Look at me and hate me, Stephen ! " 

Joe's tone was desperate. There was a fixed and 
stony expression in her eye. 

" You are mistaken. If she had cared to stay, if 
O, Joe I I loved her ! She knew it. That sent her 
away. My cruel impatience, my mad, fatal passion ! 
Strange that the highest and holiest feeling of our 
nature should rise up and become a curse torment us 
with unavailing regrets. You don't know anything 
about it, Joe, thank God ! " 

" Don't I ! " Her voice was hoarse and tremulous, 
and she broke away from his clasp. " What have you 



 

and she realized of its torments ! I thinlc if any man 
had loved me, had held me in his arms, had said the 
words you did to her, given me the kisses, I could 
defy all that would come afterwards. To love without 
these that is where it stings, Stephen ! " 

He glanced at her in amazement. A dim truth 
pierced his brain. Far back in the past in another 
and distant life, he had indulged in a boyish fancy for 
Joe association mostly. Did God mean to curse him 
on every hand, drag all these old things and thoughts to 
light as a punishment ? Did he owe this girl a debt that 
could be paid only in one way ? 

" Joe," his voice broken with infinite sorrow, " if 
I have sinned against you, can nothing make amends?" 

"O, Stephen! I don't mean that now. Whatever I 
may have dreamed in that old, foolish time, my eyes are 
clear to-day. You have given me all the love that.was 
in your heart for me. God made her beautiful and 
wise, me plain and ignorant. I know there are corners 
in your heart that I could never have filled, true wife as 
I might have been to you. Somewhere you outgrew 
me. It isn't so much the name, or the right, it is the 
fitness, the consciousness of perfect possession." 

"Where have you learned all this, Joe?" for he was 
startled at the light in her deep sad eyes. 

"I cannot tell you. It has been coming by slow 
degrees. May be, as we go on to the other country, 
we see more clearly." 

 

Stephen clasped the bowed figure to his heart. There 
was a struggle with the tears in his voice, as he said, 

"Heaven knows, Joe, I have always given you a 
brother's love. And wherein I have sinned, God has 
punished me sorely. I had no right to dream of her." 

" No." Joe raised her head and faced him steadily. 
" I told her so that night. That was why she went 
away. She could not stay and be nothing to you. I 
think her nature was too high and fine ever to "upbraid 
you by a look. I was wild and jealous, tortured by 
fierce passions ; but I would have fought it out by my- 
self if I had not known your secret." 

She was brave enough now. The burden she had 
carried for him she laid down at last at his feet. 

" What do you know ? " His face was deathly white, 
his hands trembled, his strong frame shook as with an 
aguish chill, and the words shivered through his pale 
lips in gasps. " That horrible secret ! And you have 
kept silence all these years ! " 

She knelt before him. She clasped his knees with 
her weak hands, and moaned, 

" I would have borne more than that for your sake, 
Stephen. Open shame and disgrace could not have 
estranged me ! " 

" And I was a coward ! But O, Joe, you don't know 
how hard it was ! It seemed as if God put his poor, 
weak life into my hands ; and then he was my father, 
too ! The sins of the fathers are to be visited upon the 



 

children, and so they come to me, to her. Is there no 
end to God's judgments ? " 

If Joe had been pale before, a deadly terror crept 
over her face now, making it ghastly. Her eyes stared 
in a wild, wandering manner, for there came into her 
mind a thought that tortured her like a thousand 
demons. What if all this while Stephen had been 
more sinned against than sinning? She crouched in a 
shapeless mass there on the step ; she stretched out her 
hands imploringly, and cried, 

" Tell me who struck the fatal blow, Stephen not 
you?" 

"My God, Joe! Did you believe that? Did you 
tell her? " 

The eyelids sank together, the whole frame lapsed 
into lifelessness, but the look of passionate pleading 
still remained. 

Stephen Dane had the weaknesses of humanity. The 
hot, indignant flash of conscious innocence, so deeply 
wronged, so outraged, came first. And then her love 
the words she had said " Open shame and disgrace 
could not have estranged me " pleaded powerfully for 
poor Joe. He stooped and gathered her in his arms ; he 
carried her to her room and laid her tenderly on the 
bed, chafing the cold hands. 

She opened her eyes in a feeble,, bewildered manner, 
shrinking as they met his, and cowering in abject 
terror.
