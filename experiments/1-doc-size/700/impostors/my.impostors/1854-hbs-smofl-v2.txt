Rapidly now I sped onward, paying brief visits to the 
Palais de Justice, the Hotel de Ville, and spending a cool 
half hour in Notre Dame. I love to sit in these majestic 
fanes, abstracting them from the superstition which does but 
desecrate them, and gaze upward to their lofty, vaulted arches, 
to drink in the impression of architectual sublimity, which I 
can neither analyze nor express. Cathedrals do not seem to 
me to have been built. They seem, rather, stupendous growths 
of nature, like crystals, or cliffs of basalt. There is little orna- 
ment here. That roof looks plain and bare ; yet I feel that 
the air is dense with subhmity. Onward I sped, crossing a 
bridge by the Hotel Dieu, and, leaving the river, plunged into 
narrow streets. Explored a quadrangular market ; surveyed 
the old church of St Genevieve, and the new — now the Pan- 
theon ; went onward to the Jardin des Plantes, and explored 
its tropical bowers. Many things remind me to-day of New 
Orleans, and its levee, its Mississippi, its cathedral, and the 
luxuriant vegetation of the gulf. In fact, I seem to be walk- 
ing in my sleep in a kind of glorified New Orleans, all the 
while. Yet I return to the gardens of the Tuileries and 
the Place Vendome, and in the shadow of Napoleon's Column 
the illusion vanishes. Hundreds of battles look down upon 
me from their blazonry. 

In the evening I rested from the day's fatigue by an hour 
in the garden of the Palais Royal. I sat by one of the little 
tables, and called for an ice. There were hundreds of ladies 
and gentlemen eating ices, drinking wine, reading the papers, 
smoking, chatting; scores of pretty children were frolicking and 
enjoying the balmy evening. Here six or eight midgets were 
jumping the rope, while papa and mamma swung it for them. 
Pretty little things, witli their flushed cheeks and sparkling 




eyes, how they did seem to enjoy themselves ! What parent 
was ever far from home that did not espy in every group of 
children his own little ones — his Mary or his Nelly, his Hen- 
ry or Charlie ? So it was with me. 'There was a ring of 
twenty or thirty singing and dancing, with a smaller ring in 
the centre, while old folks and boys stood outside. But I 
heard not a single oath, nor saw a rough or rude action, during 
the whole time I was there. The boys standing by looked on 
quietly, like young gentlemen. The best finale of such a 
toilsome day of sightseeing was a warm bath in the Rue du 
Bac, for the trifling sum of fifteen sous. The cheapness and 
convenience of bathing here is a great recommendation of 
Paris life. They will bring you a hot bath at your house 
for twenty-five cents, and that without bustle or disorder. 
And nothing so effectually as an evening bath, as my expe- 
rience testifies, cures fatigue and propitiates to dreamless 
slumber. 

Thursday, June 9. At the Louvre. Studied three statues 
half an hour each — the Venus Victrix, Polyhymnia, and 
Gladiateur Combattant. The first is mutilated ; but if dis- 
armed she conquers all hearts, what would she achieve in full 
panoply ? As to the Gladiator, I noted as follows on my cat- 
alogue : A pugilist ; antique, brown with age ; attitude, lean- 
ing forward ; left hand raised on guard, right hand thrown 
out back, ready to strike a side blow ; right leg bent ; straight 
line from the head to the toe of left foot ; muscles and 
veins most vividly revealed in intense development ; a won- 
derful petrifaction, as if he had been smitten to stone at the 
instant of striking. 

Here are antique mosaics, in which colored stones seem 
liquefied, realizing the most beautiful effects of painting — 







quadrigae, warriors, arms, armor, vases, streams, all lifelike. 
Ascending to the hall of French paintings I spent an hour in 
studying one picture — La Meduse, by Gericault. It is a 
shipwrecked crew upon a raft in mid ocean. I gazed until all 
surrounding objects disappeared, and I was alone upon the 
wide Atlantic. Those transparent emerald waves are no 
fiction ; they leap madly, hungering for their prey. That 
distended sail is filled with the lurid air. That dead man's 
foot hangs off in the seething brine a stark reality. What a 
fixed gaze of despair in that father's stony eye ! What a 
group of deathly living ones around that frail mast, while one 
with intense eagerness flutters a signal to some far-descried 
bark ! Coleridge's Ancient Mariner has no colors more fearfully faithful to his theme. Heaven pities them not. Ocean 
is all in uproar against them. And there is no voice that 
can summon the distant, flying sail ! So France appeared to 
that prophet painter's eye, in the subsiding tempests of the 
revolution. So men's hearts failed them for fear, and the 
dead lay stark and stiff among the living, amid the sea and 
the waves roaring; and so mute signals of distress were hung 
out in the lurid sky to nations afar. 

For my part, I remain a heretic. Give to these French 
pictures the mellowing effects of age, impregnating not merely 
the picture, but the eye that gazes on it, with its subtle 
quality ; let them be gazed at through the haze of two hun- 
dred years, and they will — or I cannot see why they will not 
— rival the productions of any past age. I do not believe that 
a more powerful piece ever was painted than yon raft by 
Gericault, nor any more beautiful than several in the 
Luxembourg ; the " Decadence de Rome," for example, ex- 
hibiting the revels of the Romans during the decline of the 




empire. Let this Decadence unroll before the eyes of men 
the cause, that wreck by Gericault symbolize the effect, in the 
great career of nations, and the two are sublimely matched. 

After visiting the Luxembourg, I resorted to the gardens 
of the Tuileries. The thermometer was at about eighty degrees in the shade. From the number of people assembled 
one would have thought, if it had been in the United States, 
that some great mass convention was coming off. Under the 
impenetrable screen of the trees, in the dark, cool, refresh- 
ing shade, are thousands of chairs, for which one pays two 
cents apiece. "Whole families come, locking up their door, 
bringing the baby, work, dinner, or lunch, take a certain num- 
ber of chairs, and spend the day. As far as eye can reach 
you see a multitude seated, as if in church, with other multi- 
tudes moving to and fro, while boys and girls without number 
are frolicking, racing, playing ball, driving hoop, &c, but 
contriving to do it without making a hideous racket. How 
French children are taught to play and enjoy themselves without disturbing every body else, is a mystery. " Cest gentil " 
seems to be a talismanic spell ; and " Oe rCest pas gentil fa " 
is sufficient to check every rising irregularity. O that some 
savant would write a book and tell us how it is done ! I gazed 
for half an hour on the spectacle. A more charming sight my 
eyes never beheld. There were grayheaded old men, and 
women, and invalids ; and there were beautiful demoiselles 
working worsted, embroidery, sewing; men reading papers; 
and, in fact, people doing every thing they would do in their 
own parlors. And all were graceful, kind, and obliging ; not 
a word nor an act of impoliteness or indecency. No wonder 
the French adore Paris, thought I ; in no other city in the 
world is a scene like this possible! No wonder that their 



 

hearts die within them at thoughts of exile in the fens of 
Cayenne ! 

But under all this there lie, as under the cultivated crust 
of this fair world, deep abysses of soul, where volcanic masses 
of molten lava surge and shake the tremulous earth. In the 
gay and bustling Boulevards, a friend, an old resident of 
Paris, pointed out to me, as we rode, the bullet marks that 
scarred the houses — significant tokens of what seems, but is 
not, forgotten. 

At sunset a military band of about seventy performers 
began playing in front of the Tuileries. They formed an immense circle, the leader in the centre. He played the octave 
flute, which also served as a baton for marking time. The 
music was characterized by delicacy, precision, suppression, 
and subjugation of rebellious material. 

I imagined a congress of horns, clarinets, trumpets, &c, 
conversing in low tones on some important theme; nay, 
rather a conspiracy of instruments, mourning between whiles 
their subjugation, and ever and anon breaking out in a fierce 
emente, then repressed, hushed, dying away ; as if they had 
heard of Baron Munchausen's frozen horn, and had conceived 
the idea of yielding their harmonies without touch of human 
lips, yet were sighing and sobbing at their impotence. Per- 
haps I detected the pulses of a nation's palpitating heart, throbbing for liberty, but trodden down, and sobbing in despair. 

In the evening Mrs. C. had her salon, a fashion of receiving 
one's friends on a particular night, that one wishes could be 
transplanted to American soil. 

No invitations are given. It is simply understood that on 
such an evening, the season through, a lady receives her friends. 
All come that please, without ceremony. A little table is set 







out with tea and a plate of cake. Behind it presides some 
fairy Emma or Elizabeth, dispensing tea and talk, bonbons 
and bon-mots, with equal grace. The guests enter, chat, walk 
about, spend as much time, or as little, as they choose, and 
retire. They come when they please, and go when they 
please, and there is no notice taken of entree or exit, no time 
wasted in formal greetings and leave takings. 

Up to this hour we had conversed little in French. One 
is naturally diffident at first ; for if one musters courage to 
commence a conversation with propriety, the problem is how 
to escape a Scylla in the second and a Charybdis in the third 
sentence. Said one of our fair entertainers, " When I first 
began I would think of some sentence till I could say it with- 
out stopping, and courageously deliver myself to some guest 
or acquaintance." But it was like pulling the string of a 
shower bath. Delighted at my correct sentence, and supposing 
me au fait, they poured upon me such a deluge of French 
that I held my breath in dismay. Considering, however, that 
nothing is to be gained by half-way measures, I resolved upon 
a desperate game. Launching in, I talked away right and 
left, up hill and down, — jumping over genders, cases, nouns, 
and adjectives, floundering through swamps and morasses, in 
a perfect steeple chase of words. Thanks to the proverbial 
politeness of my friends, I came off covered with glory ; the 
more mistakes I made the more complacent they grew. 

Nothing can surpass the ease, facility, and genial freedom 
of these soirees. Conceive of our excellent professor of Arabic 
and Sanscrit, Count M. fairly cornered by three wicked fairies, 
and laughing at their stories and swift witticisms till the 
tears roll down his cheeks. Behold yonder tall and scarred 
veteran, an old soldier of Napoleon, capitulating now before 







the witchery of genius and wit. Here the noble Russian 
exile forgets his sorrows in those smiles that, unlike the au- 
rora, warm while they dazzle. And our celebrated composer 
is discomposed easily by alert and nimble-footed mischief. 
And our professor of Greek and Hebrew roots is rooted to 
the ground with astonishment at finding himself put through 
all the moods and tenses of fun in a twinkling. Ah, culpable 
sirens, if the pangs ye have inflicted were reckoned up unto 
you, — the heart aches and side aches, — how could ye repose 
o' nights ? 

Saturday, June 11. Versailles ! When I have written that 
one word I have said all. I ought to stop. Description is 
out of the question. Describe nine miles of painting ! De- 
scribe visions of splendor and gorgeousness that cannot be 
examined in months ! Suffice it to say that we walked from 
hall to hall until there was no more soul left within us. Then, 
late in the afternoon we drove away, about three miles, to the 
villa of M. Belloc, directeur de VEcole Imperiale de Dessein. 
Madame Belloc has produced, assisted by her friend, Made- 
moiselle Montgolfier, the best French translation of Uncle 
Tom's Cabin. At this little family party we enjoyed our- 
selves exceedingly, in the heart of genuine domestic life. 
Two beautiful married daughters were there, with their 
husbands, and the household seemed complete. Madame B. 
speaks English well ; and thus, with our limited French, we 
got on delightfully together. I soon discovered that I had 
been Binning against all law in admiring any thing at Versailles. 
They were all bad paintings. There might be one or two good 
paintings at the Luxembourg, and one or two good modern paintings at the Louvre — the Meduse, by Gericault, for example. 
(How I rejoiced that I had admired it !) But all the rest of 







the modern paintings M. Belloc declared, with an inimitable 
shrug, are poor paintings. There is nothing safely admirable, 
I lind, but the old masters. All those battles of all famous 
French generals, from Charles Martel to Napoleon, and the 
battles in Algiers, by Horace Vernet, are wholly to be snuffed 
at. In painting, as in theology, age is the criterion of merit. 
Yet Yernet's paintings, though decried by M. le Directeur, 
I admired, and told him so. Said I, in French as lawless as 
the sentiment, " Monsieur, I do not know the rules of painting, 
nor whether the picture is according to them or not ; I only 
know that I like it." 

But who shall describe the social charms of our dinner ? 
All wedged together, as we were, in the snuggest little pigeon 
hole of a dining room, pretty little chattering children and all, 
whom papa held upon his knee and fed with bonbons, all the 
while impressing upon them the absolute necessity of their 
leaving the table ! There the salad was mixed by acclamation, 
each member of the party adding a word of advice, and each 
gayly laughing at the advice of the other. There a gay, red 
lobster was pulled in pieces -among us, with infinite gout ; and 
Madame Belloc pathetically expressed her fears that we did 
not like French cooking. She might have saved herself the 
trouble ; for we take to it as naturally as ducks take to the 
water. And then, when we returned to the parlor, we re- 
solved ourselves into a committee of the whole on coffee, 
which was concocted in a trim little hydrostatic engine of 
latest modern invention, before the faces of all. And so we 
right merrily spent the evening. H. discussed poetry and 
art with our kind hosts to her heart's content, and at a late 
hour we drove to the railroad, and returned to Paris. 
 



 



LETTER XXXI. 

My dear L. : — 

At last I have come into dreamland ; into the lotos-eater's 
paradise ; into the land where it is always afternoon. I am 
released from care ; I am unknown, unknowing ; I live in a 
house whose arrangements seem to me strange, old, and 
dreamy. In the heart of a great city I am as still as if in a 
convent ; in the burning heats of summer our rooms are shadowy and cool as a cave. My time is all my own. I may at 
will lie on a sofa, and dreamily watch the play of the leaves 
and flowers, in the little garden into which my room opens ; 
or I may go into the parlor adjoining, whence I hear the quick 
voices of my beautiful and vivacious young friends. You 
ought to see these girls. Emma might look like a Madonna, 
were it not for her wicked wit ; and as to Anna and Lizzie, 
as they glance by me, now and then, I seem to think them a 
kind of sprite, or elf, made to inhabit shady old houses, just 
as twinkling harebells grow in old castles ; and then the gra- 
cious mamma, who speaks French, or English, like a stream 
of silver — is she not, after all, the fairest of any of them ? And 
there is Caroline, piquant, racy, full of conversation — sharp 
as a quartz crystal : how I like to hear her talk ! These 
people know Paris, as we say in America, "like a book." 
They have studied it aesthetically, historically, socially. They 
have studied French people and French literature, — and 
studied it with enthusiasm, as people ever should, who would 



 

truly understand. They are all kindness to me. "Whenever 
I wish to see any thing, I have only to speak ; or to know, I 
have only to ask. At breakfast every morning we compare 
notes, and make up our list of wants. My first; of course, 
was the Louvre. It is close by us. Think of it. To one 
who has starved all a life, in vain imaginings of what art 
might be, to know that you are within a stone's throw of a 
museum full of its miracles, Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian, Roman sculptors and modern painting, all there ! 

I scarcely consider myself to have seen any thing of art 
in England. The calls of the living world were so various 
and exigeanty I had so little leisure for reflection, that, although 
I saw many paintings, I could not study them ; and many 
times I saw them in a state of the nervous system too jaded 
and depressed to receive the full force of the impression. A 
day or two before I left, I visited the National Gallery, and 
made a rapid survey of its contents. There were two of 
Turner's masterpieces there, which he presented on the sig- 
nificant condition that they should hang side by side with 
their two finest Claudes. I thought them all four fine pictures, but I liked the Turners best. Yet I did not think 
any of them fine enough to form an absolute limit to human 
improvement. But, till I had been in Paris a day or two, 
perfectly secluded, at full liberty to think and rest, I did not 
feel that my time for examining art had really come. 

It was, then, with a thrill almost of awe that I approached 
the Louvre. Here, perhaps, said I to myself, I shall answer, 
fully, the question that has long wrought within my soul, "What 
is art ? and what can it do ? Here, perhaps, these yearnings 
for the ideal will meet their satisfaction. The ascent to the 
picture gallery tends to produce a flutter of excitement and 



 

expectation. Magnificent staircases, dim perspectives of frescoes and carvings, the glorious hall of Apollo, rooms with 
mosaic pavements, antique vases, countless spoils of art, dazzle 
the eye of the neophyte, and prepare the mind for some grand 
enchantment. Then opens on one the grand hall of paintings 
arranged by schools, the works of each artist by themselves, 
a wilderness of gorgeous growths. 

I first walked through the whole, offering my mind up aim- 
lessly to see if there were any picture there great and glori- 
ous enough to seize and control my whole being, and answer, 
at once, the cravings of the poetic and artistic element. For 
any such I looked in vain. I saw a thousand beauties, as also 
a thousand enormities, but nothing of that overwhelming, sub- 
duing nature which I had conceived. Most of the men there 
had painted with dry eyes and cool hearts, thinking only of 
the mixing of their colors and the jugglery of then art, thinking little of heroism, faith, love, or immortality. Yet when I 
had resigned this longing ; when I was sure I should not meet 
there what I sought, then I began to enjoy very heartily what 
there was. 

In the first place, I now saw Claudes worthy of the reputa- 
tion he bore. Three or four of these were studied with great 
delight ; the delight one feels, who, conscientiously bound to 
be delighted, suddenly comes into a situation to be so. I saw, 
now, those atmospheric traits, those reproductions of the mys- 
teries of air, and of light, which are called so wonderful, and 
for which all admire Claude, but for which so few admire 
Him who made Claude, and who every day creates around us, 
in the commonest scenes, effects far more beautiful. How 
much, even now, my admiration of Claude was genuine, I 
cannot say. How can we ever be sure on this point, when 







we admire what has prestige and sanction, not to admire 
which is an argument against ourselves ? Certainly, however, 
I did feel great delight in some of these works. 

One of my favorites was Rembrandt. I always did ad- 
mire the gorgeous and solemn mysteries of his coloring. 
Rembrandt is like Hawthorne. He chooses simple and every- 
day objects, and so arranges light and shadow as to give them 
a sombre richness and a mysterious gloom. The House of 
Seven Gables is a succession of Rembrandt pictures, done in 
words instead of oils. Now, this pleases us, because our life 
really is a haunted one ; the simplest thing in it is sl mystery, 
the invisible world always lies round us like a shadow, and 
therefore this dreamy golden gleam of Rembrandt meets some- 
what in our inner consciousness to which it corresponds. There 
were no pictures in the gallery which I looked upon so long, 
and to which I returned so often and with such growing pleas- 
ure, as these. I found in them, if not a commanding, a draw- 
ing influence, a full satisfaction for one part of my nature. 

There were Raphaels there, which still disappointed me, 
because from Raphael I asked and expected more. I wished 
to feel his hand on my soul with a stronger grasp ; these were 
too passionless in their serenity, and almost effeminate in their 
tenderness. 

But Rubens, the great, joyous, full-souled, all-powerful 
Rubens ! — there he was, full as ever of triumphant, abound- 
ing life ; disgusting and pleasing ; making me laugh and 
making me angry ; defying me to dislike him ; dragging me 
at his chariot wheels ; in despite of my protests forcing me 
to confess that there was no other but he. 

This Medici gallery is a succession of gorgeous allegoric 
paintings, done at the instance of Mary of Medici, to celebrate 




 

the praise and glory of that family. I was predetermined not 
to like them for two reasons : first, that I dislike allegorical 
subjects ; and second, that I hate and despise that Medici family and all that belongs to them. So no sympathy with the 
subjects blinded my eyes, and drew me gradually from all 
else in the hall to contemplate these. It was simply the love 
of power and of fertility that held me astonished, which 
seemed to express with nonchalant ease what other painters 
attain by laborious efforts. It occurred to me that other painters are famous for single heads, or figures, and that were the 
striking heads and figures with which these pictures abound 
to be parcelled out singly, any one of them would make a 
man's reputation. Any animal of Rubens, alone, would make 
a man's fortune in that department. His fruits and flowers 
are unrivalled for richness and abundance ; his old men's 
heads are wonderful ; and when he chooses, which he does 
not often, he can even create a pretty woman. Generally 
speaking his women are. his worst productions. It would 
seem that he had revolted with such fury from the meagre, 
pale, cadaverous outlines of womankind painted by his prede- 
cessors, the Van Eyks, whose women resembled potato sprouts 
grown in a cellar, that he altogether overdid the matter in 
the opposite direction. His exuberant soul abhors leanness 
as Nature abhors a vacuum ; and hence all his women seem 
bursting their bodices with fulness, like overgrown carnations 
breaking out of their green calyxes. He gives you Venuses 
with arms fit to wield the hammer of Vulcan ; vigorous Graces 
whose dominion would be alarming were they indisposed to 
clemency. His weakness, in fact, his besetting sin, is too truly 
described by Moses : — 







" But Jeshunm waxed fat and kicked ; 
Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, 
Thou art covered with fatness." 

Scornfully he is determined upon it ;'he will none of your 
scruples ; his women shall be fat as he pleases, and you shall 
like him nevertheless. 

In this Medici gallery the fault appears less prominent than 
elsewhere. Many of the faces are portraits, and there are 
specimens among them of female beauty, so delicate as to 
demonstrate that it was not from any want of ability to represent the softer graces that he so often becomes hard and 
coarse. My friend, M. Belloc, made the remark that the 
genius of Rubens was somewhat restrained in these pictures, 
and chastened by the rigid rules of the French school, and 
hence in them he is more generally pleasing. 

I should compare Rubens to Shaksj)eare, for the wonderful 
variety and vital force of his artistic power. I know no 
other mind he so nearly resembles. Like Shakspeare, he 
forces you to accept and to forgive a thousand excesses, and 
uses his own faults as musicians use discords, only to enhance 
the perfection of harmony. There certainly is some use even 
in defects. A faultless style sends you to sleep. Defects 
rouse and excite the sensibility to seek and appreciate excellences. Some of Shakspeare's finest passages explode all 
grammar and rhetoric like skyrockets — the thought blows 
the language to shivers. 

As to Murillo, there are two splendid specimens of his style 
here, as exquisite as any I have seen ; but I do not find reason 
to alter the judgment I made from my first survey. 

Here is his celebrated picture of the Assumption of the 
Virgin, which we have seen circulated in print shops in 



 

America, but which appears of a widely different character 
in the painting. The Virgin is rising in a flood of amber 
light, surrounded by clouds and indistinct angel figures. She 
is looking upward with clasped hands, as in an ecstasy : the 
crescent moon is beneath her feet. The whole tone of the 
picture — the clouds, the drapery, her flowing hair — are per- 
vaded with this amber tint, sublimated and spiritual. Do I, 
then, like it ? No. Does it affect me ? Not at all. Why 
so ? Because this is a subject requiring earnestness ; yet, 
after all, there is no earnestness of religious feeling expressed. 
It is a surface picture, exquisitely painted — the feeling goes 
no deeper than the canvas. But how do I know Murillo has 
no earnestness in the religious idea of this piece ? How do I 
know, when reading Pope's Messiah, that he was not in ear- 
nest — that he was only most exquisitely reproducing what 
others had thought ? Does he not assume, in the most grace- 
ful way, the language of inspiration and holy rapture ? But, 
through it all, we feel the satisfied smirk of the artist, and the 
fine, sharp touch of his diamond file. What is done from a 
genuine, strong, inward emotion, whether in writing or paint- 
ing, always mesmerizes the paper, or the canvas, and gives it 
a power which every body must feel, though few know why. 
The reason why the Bible has been omnipotent, in all ages, has 
been because there were the emotions of God in it ; and of 
paintings nothing is more remarkable than that some preserve 
in them such a degree of genuine vital force that one can 
never look on them with indifference ; while others, in which 
every condition of art seems to be met, inspire no strong 
emotion. 

Yet this picture is immensely popular. Hundreds stand 
enchanted before it, and declare it imbodies their highest ideal 




of art and religion ; and I suppose it does. But so it always 
is. The man who has exquisite gifts of expression passes for 
more, popularly, than the man with great and grand ideas 
who utters but imperfectly. There are some pictures here 
by Correggio — a sleeping Venus and Cupid — a marriage of 
the infant Jesus and St. Catharine. This Correggio is the 
poet of physical beauty. Light and shadow are his god. 
"What he lives for is, to catch and reproduce flitting phases of 
these. The moral is nothing to him, and, in his own world, 
he does what he seeks. He is a great popular favorite, since 
few look for more in a picture than exquisite beauty of form 
and color. I, indeed, like him, so far as it is honestly understood between us that his sphere is to be earth, and not heaven ; 
were he to attempt, profanely, to represent heavenly things, I 
must rebel. I should as soon want Tom Moore to write me a 
prayer book. 

A large saloon is devoted to the masters of the French 
school. The works of no living artists are admitted. There 
are some large paintings by David. He is my utter aversion. 
I see in him nothing but the driest imitation of the classics. 
It would be too much praise to call it reproduction. David 
had neither heart nor soul. How could he be an artist ? — 
he who coolly took his portfolio to the guillotine to take lessons 
on the dying agonies of its victims — how could he ever paint 
any thing to touch the heart ? 

In general, all French artists appear to me to have been 
very much injured by a wrong use of classic antiquity. 
Nothing could be more glorious and beautiful than the Gre- 
cian development ; nothing more unlike it than the stale, 
wearisome, repetitious imitations of it in modern times. The 
Greek productions themselves have a living power to this 







day ; but all imitations of them are cold and tiresome. These 
old Greeks made such beautiful things, because they did not 
imitate. That mysterious vitality which still imbues their remains, and which seems to enchant even the fragments of 
their marbles, is the mesmeric vitality of fresh, original conception. Art, built upon this, is just like what the shadow of 
a beautiful woman is to the woman. One gets tired in these 
galleries of the classic band, and the classic headdress, and 
the classic attitude, and the endless repetition of the classic 
urn, and vase, and lamp, as if nothing, else were ever to be 
made in the world except these things. 

Again : in regard to this whole French gallery, there is much 
of a certain quality which I find it very difficult to describe in 
any one word — a dramatic smartness, a searching for striking and peculiar effects, which render the pictures very likely to please on first sight, and to weary on longer acquaintance. 
It seems to me to be the work of a race whose senses and 
perceptions of the outward have been cultivated more than the 
deep inward emotions. Few of the pictures seem to have 
been the result of strong and profound feeling, of habits of 
earnest and concentrated thought. There is an abundance 
of beautiful little phases of sentiment, pointedly expressed; 
there is a great deal of what one should call the picturesque 
of the morale ; but few of its foundation ideas. I must except 
from these remarks the very strong and earnest painting of 
the Meduse, by Gericault, which C. has described. That 
seems to me to be the work of a man who had not seen 
human life and suffering merely on the outside, but had 
felt, in the very depths of his soul, the surging and earth- 
quake of those mysteries of passion and suffering which un- 
derlie our whole existence in this world. To me it was a 



 

picture too mighty and too painful — whose power I confessed, but which I did not like to contemplate. 

On the whole, French painting is to me an exponent of the 
great difficulty and danger of French life ; that passion for 
the outward and visible, which all their education, all the arrangements of their social life, 'every thing in their art and 
literature, tends continually to cultivate and increase. Hence 
they have become the leaders of the world in what I should 
call the minor artistics — all those little particulars which render life beautiful. Hence there are more pretty pictures, and 
popular lithographs, from France than from any other country 
in the world ; but it produces very little of the deepest and 
highest style of art. 

In this connection I may as well give you my Luxembourg 
experience, as it illustrates the same idea. I like Paul de la 
Roche, on the whole, although I think he has something of the 
fault of which I speak. He has very great dramatic power ; 
but it is more of the kind shown by Walter Scott than of the 
kind shown by Shakspeare. He can reproduce historical 
characters with great vividness and effect, and with enough 
knowledge of humanity to make the verisimilitude admirably 
strong ; but as to the deep knowledge with which Shakspeare 
searches the radical elements of the human soul, he has it not. 
His Death of Queen Elizabeth is a strong Walter Scott picture ; so are his Execution of Strafford, and his Charles I., 
which I saw in England. 

As to Horace Vernet, I do not think he is like either Scott 
or Shakspeare. In him this French capability for rendering 
the outward is wrought to the highest point ; and it is out- 
wardness as pure from any touch of inspiration or sentiment 
as I ever remember to have seen. He is graphic to the 







utmost extreme. His horses and his men stand from the 
canvas to the astonishment of all beholders. All is vivacity, 
bustle, dazzle, and show. I think him as perfect, of his kind, 
as possible ; though it is a kind of art with which I do not 
sympathize. 

The picture of the Decadence de Rome indicates to my 
mind a painter who has studied and understood the classi- 
cal forms ; vitalizing them, by the reproductive force of 
his own mind, so as to give them the living power of 
new creations. In this picture is a most grand and melan- 
choly moral lesson. The classical forms are evidently not 
introduced because they are classic, but in subservience to 
the expression of the moral. In the orgies of the sensualists 
here represented he gives all the grace and beauty of sensuality without its sensualizing effect. Nothing could be more 
exquisite than the introduction of the busts of the departed 
heroes of the old republic, looking down from their pedestals 
on the scene of debauchery below. It is a noble picture, 
which I wish was hung up in the Capitol of our nation to 
teach our haughty people that as pride, and fulness of bread, 
and laxness of principle brought down the old republics, so 
also ours may fall. Although the outward in this painting, 
and the classical, is wrought to as fine a point as in any French 
picture, it is so subordinate to the severity of the thought, that 
while it pleases it does not distract. 

But to return to the Louvre. The halls devoted to paint-
