"Who wrote this theme?" he thundered, maddened by her contempt.

"I have told you--I did. No one else has seen it."

"You lie!"

With one lightning glance, she arose; but he placed himself between her
and the door.

"Let me pass!" she ordered.

"Signor Alboni!" said Miss Carleton, who had before endeavored to make
herself heard, "I can certify to the truth of Miss Ross' statement. I
saw her commence and complete her manuscript."

"Aha! yet she says it has been seen only by herself. You must tutor
your witnesses more carefully. They convict, instead of exculpate."

"If you hint at collusion between Miss Ross and myself, I can say that
we never exchanged a word until an hour since. My desk adjoins hers;
it was this circumstance which furnished me with the knowledge of her
morning's occupation."

"I beg you will not subject yourself to further insult, upon my
account," interrupted Ida, whose figure had dilated and heightened
during the colloquy;--then to him--"Once more I command you to
stand aside! If you do not obey, I shall call Mr. Purcell." As if
he had heard the threatened appeal, the principal appeared in the
doorway, in blank astonishment at the novel aspect of affairs. Alboni
commenced a hurried jargon, inarticulate through haste and rage; Ida
stood with folded arms, her countenance settled in such proud scorn
as Lucifer would have envied and striven to imitate. The prudent
preceptor perceived at a glance the danger of present investigation;
and abruptly declaring the lesson concluded, appointed an hour on the
morrow for a hearing of the case. That evening, for the first time in
many months, Ida voluntarily sought her guardian's presence. Josephine
was in her room, and he was left to the enjoyment of solitude and the
newspaper. He arose at the approach of his visitant, and offered her
a chair. In these little matters of etiquette, he was particular to
punctiliousness; carrying his business habits of law and order into
every thing. The paper was replaced upon the stand; the spectacles
wiped and returned to their case; and those matter-of-fact eyes raised
with an interrogative look.

"You have been informed of the altercation that occurred in the Italian
class to-day?" Ida said, waiving the preliminary remarks.

"Josephine mentioned it."

"May I ask what was her version of it?"

"It was a statement of facts."

"Doubtless. Then, sir, you are aware that I have been wantonly and
grossly insulted by a man for whom I have no respect; that in the
presence of the entire class, I was forced to listen to language,
which, uttered by one man to another, would be met by prompt
chastisement; you are furthermore advised of the fact that he, whose
duty it is to protect those whom he instructs, instead of compelling
the creature to apologize upon his knees, 'postponed inquiry until
to-morrow.'"

"And very properly, too."

"Unquestionably, sir!" with the sarcastic smile which accompanied her
former assent. "My object in seeking this interview, is to request your
attendance upon that occasion. I shall not be present."

"And why not?"

"Because, sir, I will not be confronted with that odious reptile,
and give my testimony in his hearing. Judging from the past, and the
knowledge of mankind I have acquired under your tuition, nothing that
I can say will avail to secure me justice. Mr. Purcell cannot obtain a
better teacher, and it is as politic in Alboni to remain. There will
be an amicable settlement; and my word will be a knot in the chain
of satisfactory evidence they will elicit. The young ladies will, of
course, side with 'the gentlemen.'"

"But why am I to be there?--to receive Alboni's apology?"

"I want none, sir--I will hear none. I have been called a liar! his
pitiful life could not expiate the offence!"

"You are savage, young lady! you wish, perhaps, that I should pistol
him."

"I thank you, sir, for recalling by your ridicule, the remembrance that
this is a business interview. What I ask is this:--that you announce
to Signor Alboni the termination of my studies with him, and pay his
bill."

"Do you know, that although it is only the second week of the session,
you will be charged for the term?"

"I do, sir."

"What if I refuse to discharge the debt?"

"I shall liquidate it with the money intended for my personal expenses."

"And if I forbid this, and command you to continue your lessons?"

"I shall refuse obedience to a demand you have not the right to make."

"Miss Ross! do you know to whom you are speaking?"

"I address Mr. Read."

"And your guardian, young lady!"

"The guardian of my property, sir."

"You are under no obligations to me, I suppose."

"None that I am conscious of. You are paid for your services and my
board."

"There are cares for which money can offer no adequate compensation."

"Indeed, sir! I thought gold a cure for every ill; a reward for every
toil. But we are digressing. You will do as I wish?"

"Resume your seat, if you please! The hope that I might have regarded
your request favorably, is lessened by your unbecoming deportment.
You are ignorant of any benefits I have conferred upon you! Since you
will have a debit and credit account, I will enlighten you on this
point. You came into this house two years ago--a romantic, sentimental,
mawkish, spoiled child; weeping at every word which happened to jar
upon your exquisite sensibilities; an unsophisticated simpleton; a
fit prey for any bungler in deception; unformed in manner; womanish
in feeling, and extravagant in expression. You have now, although
but seventeen years of age, more sense and self-possession than most
women of double your years; control the weaknesses which rendered you
so ridiculous; are accomplished and respected; in short, I say it
without flattery to myself, or to you, bid fair to fill your position
in society creditably. You have still obstacles to surmount; but I
have judged your failings leniently, attributing them, mainly, to the
defects in your early training. If your mother had had the wisdom and
discretion"--

"Stop, sir, stop!" exclaimed the girl, rising from her chair, and
trembling in every limb with excitement "Take not the name of my holy
mother upon your lips--still less cast the shadow of reproach upon
her conduct! You have taught me the corruption of human nature,--have
crushed all the warm affections I had been instructed to cherish;--have
made the life my young mind pictured so inviting, a desert waste,
inhabited by wily monsters;--but over the wreck there shines one ray,
the memory of an angel lent to earth! For her sake I live among those
whose form she wore, but with whose foul hearts hers could have had no
fellowship. You tell me she was like the rest, that the religion, in
her so lovely, is a delusion--and I answer, I do not believe you. In
her name I refute your vile sophisms! Heaven knows how little I have
profited by her counsels and example. I loathe myself! 'A woman,' you
said! rather a fiend! for such is woman when she buries her heart, nor
mourns above its grave. 'Control my feelings!' I do! I have driven
back the tears until the scalding waves have killed whatever in my
soul could boast a heavenly birth. There is nothing there to prove my
relationship to my mother, but her memory. When that is destroyed I
shall go mad. I am on the verge of insanity now--I often am! I do not
doubt your assertions as to your, and shame on me that I should say
it, my brethren; for in yourself I see all the traits you ascribe
to them. Woman, you say, belongs to an order of yet inferior beings;
and in your daughter I have an illustration of this; for she inherits
her father's character, combined with a meaner mind. You consider that
I owe you respect,--I do not! I am superior to you both, for I still
struggle with the emotions our Creator kindled up within us, and sent
us to earth to extinguish. Within your bosoms there are only cold
ashes. Frown as you please! your anger intimidates as little as your
ridicule abashes. The idea once entered my mind that I could win you
and your child to love me. I could laugh at the thought; that was in
my sentimental days, when I deemed that the desolate orphan must find
affection somewhere. My most 'extravagant' imaginings never paint such
a possibility now. I have done. We understand each other. The contempt
you had for the 'mawkish' baby, cannot equal mine for you. You will
say no more of obligation and respect. I despise you, and I owe you
nothing?"

"Is the girl mad in good earnest?" gasped the cause of this burning
torrent, as the door closed upon her. "She's a dangerous customer when
her blood is up--a perfect Vesuvius, and I came near being Herculaneum
or Pompeii. I've seen Ross in these tantrums, when we were chums
together. She looked like her father when she said she was my superior.
Bah!" He picked up his "Enquirer," but the political news was stale and
vapid: the "Whig" was tried with no better success. In the centre of
the racy editorial, and oddly mixed with the advertisements, was that
incarnation of pride and passion, which through her eyes, more plainly
than her lips, said, "I despise you, and I owe you nothing." Thus stood
her part of the account he had proposed to examine.




CHAPTER IV.


Miss Carleton acknowledged the appearance of her desk-mate on the
succeeding morning, by an inclination of the head and a smile; and
nothing more passed between them until the hour for Italian. She
paused, seeing that Ida retained her seat. "Are you not going in?" she
ventured to ask.

"No."

There was a moment of hesitation, and she spoke again. "I would not
appear to dictate, but do you not fear Mr. Purcell may construe your
non-attendance into disrespect to himself?"

"I fear nothing," was upon Ida's tongue, but her better nature would
not allow her to return rudeness for what, suspicion could torture
into nothing but disinterested kindness. With a gleam of her former
frankness she looked up at her interlocutor, "You do not know as much
as I do, or you would understand the inutility of my presence at the
trial which comes off this morning. I would avoid a repetition of
yesterday's scene. One will suffice for a life-time."

"You met then with insult and injustice. To-day, Mr. Purcell will
shield you from both. As a gentleman, and a conscientious judge, he
cannot but see that Alboni's attack was uncalled for, and decide
against him."

"No man is conscientious when his conscience militates against his
purse and popularity."

Miss Carleton seemed shocked, and Ida added, hastily, "Our views upon
this, as upon most subjects, are very different, I fancy; therefore,
discussion is worse than useless. In this instance, my determination is
taken;" and she opened her book.

"I will not attempt to shake it," replied her companion. "But suffer
me to hope for a longer conversation at some future time, upon these
topics, concerning which you think we differ. There may be some points
of agreement, and I, for one, am open to conviction."

Again was Ida thrown off her guard, and the smile that answered
irradiated her face like a sudden sunbeam. But when her class-mate
had gone, she thought,--"Weak fool! the reserve I have striven for
two years to establish, melted by a soft speech of a school-girl. She
is one of the would-be 'popular' sort, and would worm herself into
confidence by an affectation of sympathy and sweetness."

"Miss Ross," said Mr. Purcell, a while later, coming up to her desk,
"you will do me the favor to meet me in my study at two o'clock."

At the time designated, she walked with a stately tread through the
long school-room, unabashed by the hundred curious eyes bent upon her;
for a summons to "the study" was an event of rare occurrence, and had
been heretofore the harbinger of some important era in the annals of
school-dom. Ida was prepared for every thing partiality could dictate,
and tyranny execute; but Mr. Purcell was alone, and his demeanor
anything but menacing. "He thinks to cajole me," whispered the fell
demon Distrust, and her heart changed to steel.

"Miss Ida," began the principal, mildly, "this is your third session
in this institution, and I can sincerely declare that during that
time, your propriety of behaviour, and diligence in study have not
been surpassed. I have never had a young lady under my care, whose
improvement was more rapid--of whose attainments I was more proud; but
I regret to say, never one whose confidence I failed so signally to
gain. A teacher's task, my dear Miss Ross, is at best an arduous one,
but if he receive no recompense for his toil in the affection of those
for whom he labors, his life is indeed one of cheerless drudgery. You
appear to regard me as a mere machine. For a time I attributed your
reserve to diffidence, and trusted that time and my efforts would
dissipate it. On the contrary, the distance between us has increased.
You hold yourself aloof from your school-mates, repelling every offered
familiarity, yet I have seen you weep after such an act. Your cheek
glows with enthusiasm when your favorite studies engage your mind,
and you relapse into frigid hauteur when recalled to the actual world
around you. You have feeling as well as intellect--you are acting a
part assumed from some unaccountable fancy; or, I would rather believe,
put upon you by necessity. The evidence of your want of reliance in my
friendship which you have given me to-day, has determined me to speak
candidly with you. I would not wrest a confession from you which you
might afterwards repent, but I entreat you to look upon me as a friend
who has a paternal love for each member of his numerous family, who
desires to see you happy, and asks--not your confidence, but that you
will let him serve you."

Ida sat like a statue. He resumed in a tone of disappointment--

"As to the unjustifiable charge brought by Signor Alboni--I am aware
how galling is even the appearance of humiliation upon so proud a
spirit. I have investigated the matter carefully. The testimony of
your friend, Miss Carleton, would of itself have been sufficient to
exonerate you. It was confirmed by the voice of the class, and the
inevitable consequence is, that Signor Alboni no longer has a place in
my school. I can safely promise that the teacher I have selected in his
stead, will oppose no impediment to your progress."

Shame for her unjust accusations, and remorseful gratitude pierced
Ida's bosom. Greatly agitated, she approached her instructor, when
Mr. Read walked in;--a cynical iceberg! Every generous emotion--all
softness vanished on the instant. His inquiring glance encountered one
as freezing. "I will not detain you longer, Mr. Purcell," she said, as
if concluding a business arrangement. "As nearly as I can understand,
your object in sending for me was to secure me as a pupil of the new
language-master. Having undertaken the study of the Italian, I prefer
going through with the course. Mr. Read will settle the terms. Good
afternoon, gentlemen;" and with the mien of a duchess she left them.

Mr. Read "had been delayed by pressing business. Miss Ross requested
him to see Signor Alboni--was sorry he was late--presumed all was
right, etc.," and walked out again. Mr. Purcell was too much hurt, and
too indignant at his pupil's conduct, to care whether he stayed or not.

The misguided girl had alienated a true friend, and she knew it--felt
it in her heart's core. In the solitude of her chamber she wept bitter
tears: "I have cast away the gem for which I would sell my soul! While
I thirsted for the waters of affection, I struck down the hand that
held them to my lip. It is my fate--I was not born to be loved--I hate
myself--why should I inspire others with a different feeling?"

In vain she tried to reason herself into a belief of Mr. Purcell's
insincerity. Truth speaks with a convincing tongue, and she knew that
the imputation of interested motives she had hurled at him in the
unfortunate revulsion of feeling, was unfounded.

In intermission next day, a note was laid upon Ida's desk, inscribed in
towering capitals, to "Misses Ross and Carleton;" It ran thus:--

 "At a large and enthusiastic meeting of the Italian class of Mr.
 Purcell's Young Ladies' Female Seminary, convened on yesterday
 afternoon, the succeeding resolutions were proposed, and carried
 unanimously:

 "Resolved, That whereas, Miss Ida Ross and Miss Caroline Carleton,
 members of the aforesaid class, have, by their spirited independence
 delivered us from an oppression as grinding as that under which our
 Revolutionary forefathers groaned, a vote of thanks shall be tendered
 them in the name of their compatriots. And--

 "Resolved, Moreover, that we bind ourselves to assist them by our
 united suffrages in the attainment of any honor for which they shall
 hereafter be candidates, whether the dunce-block or the gold medal.

 ANNA TALBOT, Chairman.
 ELLEN MORRIS, Secretary.

The event which had elicited this public manifestation, was to Ida,
connected with too much that was unpleasant, to allow her to smile at
the pompous communication. She passed it gravely to her neighbor. She
laughed at the ludicrous repetition of feminist in the second line, and
at the conclusion, bounded upon the platform where stood Mr. Purcell's
desk, and commenced a flourishing harangue "for herself and colleague,"
expressing their gratitude at the flattering tribute from their
fellow-laborers, and pledging themselves to uphold forever their honor
and lawful privileges. "In the language of your eloquent resolution, my
sisters, we form a 'Young Ladies' Female Seminary'--womanfully will we
battle for woman's rights."

"Hush-h-h!" and Mr. Purcell was discovered standing behind the crowd.
He stood aside to let the blushing orator return to her seat, remarking
in an under-tone as she passed, "I must take care to enlist such
talents in my service--I shall be undone if they are directed against
me."

"Oh Carry! what did he say?" whispered Fanny Porter.

"Nothing very dreadful," she returned, laughingly. Ida looked on in
surprise, Josephine with scorn; but to the majority, this little
episode in their monotonous life was a diverting entertainment.

"Give me a girl who is not too proud to relish a joke," said Ellen
Morris. "Ida Ross is above such buffoonery. She would not have demeaned
her dignity before the school."

"But Carry spoke for her too," said Emma Glenn, a meek, charitable
creature: "Perhaps modesty, not pride, kept her silent."

"Fiddlesticks!" was the school-girlish rejoinder.

Ida had missed a chance for making herself popular. The girls were
moved to admiration by her manner of resenting Alboni's rudeness, and
their joy at getting rid of him, assumed the shape of gratitude to
their champion. She was for the hour a heroine, and might have retained
her stand, but for her cool treatment of their advances. She saw,
without understanding the reason of the change, that there was now a
mingling of dislike in their neglect; and as she sank in their esteem,
Carry mounted. Mr. Purcell never noticed her out of the recitation
room--Mr. Read was more lofty--Josephine more contemptuous than ever.
Inmates of one house--occupying adjacent chambers--sitting at the same
board at home, and within speaking distance at school, the two girls
had not one feeling in common--a spark of affection one for the other.
Open ruptures were infrequent now, although they were innumerable
during the first months of their companionship. They appeared together
in public--this Mr. Read enjoined "It was due to his reputation, people
should not say that his daughter's privileges exceeded his ward's."
Further than this he did not interfere. He saw them only at meal-times,
and in the evening; then Josephine presided over the tea-tray with
skill and grace, and amused him, if he wished it, by reading, singing
or talking. Ida did as she pleased. There were no requirements, no
privations. In the eyes of the world her situation was unexceptionable.
They knew nothing of the covert sneers which smiled down any tendency
to what the torpid minds of the father and daughter considered undue
enthusiasm; their sarcastic notice of her "singularities," their
studied variance with her views;--but to her, bondage and cruelty would
have been more tolerable. Yet this mocking surveillance--this certainty
of ridicule, could not always check the earnest expression of a
grasping intellect and ardent temperament; and there were not a few who
frequented the house, who preferred the piquancy of her conversation,
when they could draw her out of the snow-caverns of her reserve, to the
trite common-places and artificial spirits of Miss Read.

Among these was Mr. Dermott, an Irish gentleman of considerable
scientific renown, and a traveller of some note; hard upon forty years
of age, but enjoying life with the zest of twenty. Ida's intelligent
countenance had pleased him at their introduction, and having letters
to Mr. Read, he embraced every opportunity to improve the acquaintance.

"I shall not go to school to-day," said Josephine, one morning,
"father expects Mr. Dermott and several other gentlemen to dine with
him, and I cannot be spared. He says you must come home in time for
dinner."

"As school breaks up at three, and you will not dine before five, there
was no need to issue the command;" said Ida, irritated at her arrogant
tone.

"Very well, I have delivered the message."

Mr. Read was dissatisfied that his ward did not enter the drawing-room
until dinner was announced. "It did not look well,"--and her nonchalant
air and slight recognition of the party, did not "speak well for his
bringing up." But the current veered before meal was over. The fowls
were under-done, and the potatoes soaked. His glance of displeasure at
his daughter was received with such imperturbability, that he chafed
at the impossibility of moving her, and his desire to render somebody
uncomfortable. The latter wish was not left ungratified. One after
another felt the influence of his lowering brow, and imitated his
silence, until Mr. Dermott and Ida were the only ones who maintained
a connected conversation. He talked fluently with the humor peculiar
to his countrymen, and had succeeded in interesting his listener. She
had naturally a happy laugh, which in earlier years rung out in merry
music; and as the unusual sound startled him from time to time, Mr.
Read took it as a personal affront. Could not she see that he was out
of temper? He had punished the rest for the cook's misdeeds, how dare
she, while they sat 'neath the thunder cloud of his magnificent wrath,
sport in the sunshine? It was audacious bravado. She should rue it
ere long. Josephine readily obeyed his signal to leave the table, so
soon as it could be done with a semblance of propriety. "I will hear
the rest, by and by," said Ida to Mr. Dermott, "au revoir." Neither
of the girls spoke after quitting the dining-room. Josephine lay upon
a lounge, with half-closed lids, apparently drowsy or fatigued, in
reality, wakeful and watching. Ida walked back and forth, humming an
Irish air--pleased and thoughtful. Then taking from the book-case a
volume of "Travels," she employed herself in looking it over.

"See!" said she, at Mr. Dermott's reappearance, "it is as I thought.
This author's account varies, in some respects, from yours; and at the
peril of my place in your good graces, I must declare my prejudices
to be with him. A spot so celebrated, so sacred in its associations,
cannot be as uninteresting as you would have me to think. Come,
confess, that the jolting camel and surly guide were accessories to
your discontent."

Josephine lost the answer, and much that followed. She was joined
by young Pemberton, a fop of the first water, with sense enough to
make him uneasy in the society of the gifted, and meanness to rejoice
in their discomfiture and misfortune. For the rest, he was weak and
hot-headed, a compound of conceit and malice. Time was when he admired
Ida. He had an indefinite notion that a clever wife would reflect
lustre upon him; and a very decided appreciation of her more shining
and substantial charms.

Her repulse was a mortal offence: small minds never forget, much less
pardon a rebuke to their vanity, and he inly swore revenge. But how to
get it? She rose superior to his witless sarcasms, and more pointed
slights; reversing the arrows towards himself, and his mortification
heated into hatred. Josephine was aware of this feeling, and its cause;
and while despising, in a man, a weakness to which she was herself a
prey, foreseeing that he might prove a convenient tool, she attached
him to her by suasives and flatteries.

"It is a positive relief to talk to you, Miss Josephine," he yawned, "I
am surfeited with literature and foreigners. These travelled follows
are outrageous bores, with their bushy moustachios and outlandish
lingo. How the ladies can fawn upon them as they do, I cannot
comprehend."

"Do not condemn us all for the failings of a part. There are those who
prefer pure gold to gilded trash."

"For your sake, I will make some exceptions," with a "killing" look.
"But what do you imagine to be the object of that flirtation? No young
lady of prudence or proper self-respect, would encourage so boldly the
attentions of a stranger. Supposing him to be what he represents, (a
thing by no means certain,) she cannot intend to marry him--a man old
enough to be her father!"

"But, 'unison of tastes,' 'concord of souls,' etc., will go far towards
reconciling her to the disparity of years," observed Josephine,
ironically; not sorry to strike upon this tender point. He tried to
laugh, but with indifferent success.

Ida's voice reached them, and they stopped to listen.

"I am afraid my conceptions of Eastern life and scenery are more
poetical than correct. I picture landscapes sleeping in warm, rich,
'Syrian sunshine,' 'sandal groves and bowers of spice,'

  'Ruined shrines, and towers that seem
  The relics of some splendid dream,'--

such a Fairy Land as ignorance and imagination create."

"The Utopia of one who studies Lalla Rookh more than 'Eastern
Statistics,' or 'Incidents of Travel,'" said Mr. Dermott, smiling. "Yet
Moore's descriptions are not so much overwrought as some suppose. His
words came continually to my tongue. He has imbibed the true spirit
of Oriental poetry; the melancholy, which, like the ghost of a dead
age, broods over that oldest of lands; the passion flushing under
their tropical sun; their wealth of imagery. Lalla Rookh reads like a
translation from the original Persian. The wonder is that he has never
been self-tempted to visit the 'Vale of Cashmere' in person."

"Campbell, too, having immortalized Wyoming, will not cross the ocean
to behold it," said Ida.

There was a consultation between the confederates, and Pemberton
crossed to Ida's chair, with a smirk that belied the fire in his eye.

"Excuse me, Mr. Dermott,--Miss Ida, I am commissioned to inquire of you
the authorship and meaning of this quotation--

  'Deeply, darkly, desperately blue!'"

It is impossible to convey a just impression of the offensive tone and
emphasis with which this impertinence was uttered. The quick-witted
Irishman saw through the design in an instant. "It is from a Scotch
author," said he, before Ida could reply, "and the rhyme runs after
this fashion--

  'Feckless, fairlie, farcically fou!'"

and not deigning a second glance at the questioner, he continued his
account of a visit he had paid to Moore. The object of this merciless
retort stood for a second, in doubt as to its meaning, and then walked
off, still in incertitude. Ida's laugh, while it might have been in
response to Mr. Dermott's story assured Josephine that her end was
unaccomplished, before her messenger had delivered his lame return.

"She understood me, and it cut pretty deeply, but that puppy of a
paddy answered for her. He repeated the next line, too, 'from a Scotch
author,' he said, but I believe he made it up."

"What was it?" asked Josephine.

"'Fairly, farcically fou,' or something like that. If I were sure that
last word meant fool, I would knock him down. Do you understand Scotch?"

"No," replied Josephine, vexed, but afraid to excite him further. "He
is beneath the notice of a gentleman; we can let him alone."

But Ida's share in this was not to be overlooked. Josephine appeared as
usual at breakfast: talkative to her father, and taciturn to her female
companion. At length she inquired, meaningly, "by the way, Ida, when
does your travelled Hibernian 'lave this counthry?'"

"If you speak of Mr. Dermott, I do not know."

"Is it not remarkable," said Josephine to her parent, "that polish and
purify as you may, you cannot cure an Irishman of vulgarity? Irish he
is, and Irish he will remain to the end of the chapter."

"Dermott behaves very decently, does he not? His letters of
recommendation--introduction, I would say, describe him as a pattern
gentleman."

Josephine lifted her brows. "It is a misfortune to be fastidious;
my education has rendered me so. I cannot tolerate slang or abuse,
especially when directed at a superior in politeness, if not in
assurance."

"What now?" demanded Mr. Read, impatiently; and Ida, unable to hear
more in silence, started up from the table.

"Wait, if you please," said Josephine, with that metallic glitter
of her grey eyes. "I wish you to repeat your friend's reply to Mr.
Pemberton, when he was the bearer of a civil message from me."

"I heard no message of that description," retorted Ida, unmoved.

"He did not repeat a line of poetry, and ask the author's name, I
presume?"

"He did."

"And you furnished the required information?"

"I did not."

"Mr. Dermott did, then. What was his answer?"

"I do not choose to tell. I am not in the habit of playing spy and
informer."

"Then I shall repeat it. I am not in the habit of winking at
impudence or transgressions of the most common laws of society. What do
you say, sir, of a man who, in the presence of ladies, calls another a
'farcical fool?'"

"That he is a foreign jackanape. He never darkens my door again. You
heard this?" to Ida.

"I did not, sir, but Mr. Pemberton displays such penetration in
discovering, and taste in fitting on caps that could suit no one else
so well, I am not inclined to contest his title to this latest style."

"I do not wonder at your defence of your erudite suitor," said
Josephine, laying a disagreeable stress upon the adjective. "If he
were to single me out in every company, as the one being capable
of appreciating him, I, too, should be blinded by the distinction
attendant upon my notoriety. But as His Highness never gives token, by
word or deed, of his consciousness of the existence of so unpretending
a personage, I may be pardoned my impartial observation and judgment. I
do not expect you to forbid his visits, sir, but I wish it understood
that I am not at home when he calls."

"And that you reject his attentions?" asked Ida, dryly.

Josephine did not like her smile, yet saw no danger in
replying--"assuredly!"

"It is a pity," was the rejoinder, "that your resolution was not
postponed until Tuesday."

"And why?" said Mr. Read.

"Mr. Dermott informed me last night that he had secured three tickets
for the concert of Monday evening, and requested permission to call
for Josephine and myself. I told him that she had expressed anxiety
to attend, and that I was disengaged. She was not in the parlor when
he left, and he entrusted the invitation to me. He will be here this
forenoon for her answer. As things now stand, his visit will be
extremely mal-apropos. I shall decline for myself; she can do the same."

Josephine prudently lowered her eye-lids, but her lips were white with
rage. She had especial reasons for desiring to go to this concert.
Every body was running mad after the principal performer:--absence from
necessity would be a pitiable infliction;--to stay away from choice,
irrefragable proof of want of taste. To be escorted thither by Mr.
Dermott, would give her an eclat the devotion of a score of Pembertons
could not produce. In seeking to mortify another, she had pulled down
this heavy chagrin upon her own head,--common fate of those who would
make the hearts and backs of their fellows the rounds of their ladder
to revenge or to fame.

Even Mr. Read was momentarily disconcerted. "I will procure you a
ticket," he said, consolingly.

That tongue was used to falsehood, yet it did not move as glibly as was
its wont, as she replied, "I do not care to go, sir."

"That is fortunate," said Ida, "as every seat was taken yesterday. You
do not object to my withdrawing now?"

The shot had gone home; her enmity was gratified; she had not been
anxious to attend from the first, and therefore was not disappointed;
she did not suffer from pained sensibility; the frequency of these
encounters had inured her to ambushed attack; she was fast becoming
a match for them in stoicism, and surpassed them in satire; in this
skirmish she had borne flying colours from the field; but had the
contrary of all these things been true, she could not have been
more wretched. She hated, as spirits like hers only can hate, her
cold-hearted persecutors, and exulted in their defeat; yet close upon
triumph came a twinge of remorse and a sense of debasement.

"I am sinking to their level! I could compete with them upon no other
ground. They are despicable in their worldliness and malice; shall I
grovel and hiss with them? It seems inevitable--debarred as I am from
all associations which can elevate and clear my mind. Oh! the low envy
in that girl's face as she named my 'suitor!' Destitute of mental wants

this matter must be arranged."

She opened her writing-desk. Her chamber was her retreat and sanctum,
and she had lavished much taste and time in fitting it up. All its
appurtenances spoke of genius and refinement. With a poetic love for
warm colors and striking contrasts, crimson and black relieved, each
the other, in her carpet and curtains. The bedstead, seats and tables,
fashioned into elegant and uncommon forms by her orders, were draped
and cushioned with the same Tyrian hue. Books and portfolios were
heaped and strewed upon the shelves and stands; and in one corner, upon
a wrought bronze tripod, was an exquisite statuette--a girl kneeling
beside an empty cage, the lifeless songster stark and cold in her hand.
Several of Ida's schoolmates were with her when she purchased it from
an itinerant Italian. They saw in the expression of hopeless sadness,
only regret for her bird. Ida noted that her gaze was not upon its
ruffled plumes, but to its silent home; and that one hand lay upon her
heart. Looking more narrowly she discerned upon the pedestal the simple
exclamation, "Et mon coeur!"

Henceforward it had become her Lares. She had scattered flowers over
it, kissed it weepingly, and with lips rigid in stern despair, laid her
hot brow to the white forehead of the voiceless mourner. She must have
something to love, and the insensate image was dear, because it told of
a grief such as hers. Now, after she dipped her pen in the standish,
she paused to contemplate it,--the red light bathing it in a life-like
