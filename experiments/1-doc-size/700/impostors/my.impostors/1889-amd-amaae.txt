autumn. Besides her board, she insisted upon paying 
six dollars for the carriage-hire, and made Joe a 
little gift that surprised him greatly. 

"Take good care of my girl," she said to me at 
parting. " I can't have her getting faded and worn, 
no, not for twenty houses." 

" I should be rich enough to keep her a lady," I 
answered with a regretful sigh. 

" Eve Thurston could never be any thing but a 
lady," she returned rather sharply. "And if she 
willed, she might be kept in luxury." 

The next thing was Mrs. West's departure. We 
had become so attached to her, that I think even 
Joe shed some tears with his good-by. Her daughter, 
an elegant, middle-aged woman, came over for her, 
and expressed not only gratitude but delight that 
her mother had fallen in such good hands. It was a 
sad parting, and they exchanged promises of writing. 

But for Mrs. Wilbur I think Eve would have been 
quite depressed by the loneliness of the house. I 
wondered what we would do when winter came. 
But she had to get in order for the new influx. 
Letty was ready to come now; and I was glad to 
have Eve relieved of some work, though she did not 
look as if her care had weighed heavily. 

The 1st of July was Saturday. Five girls were 
coming, and on Sunday two gentlemen. The rooms 



 

were freshened and put in order, and made sweet 
with flowers. Mrs. Wilbur came up. She was much 
amused at what she called a " hen party." 

Certainly they were the gayest crowd. The two 
Brooke girls, a Miss Fisher whom I had met at 
aunt Carry's, Bel Lane, and Kitty Travers. The 
sixth would arrive on Monday. 

We asked Pryor to come up to tea. I needed 
some one to keep me in countenance. We had 
broiled chicken, fried potatoes, raspberry shortcake, 
and custard. But the merriment was beyond any 
description. I thought them the wittiest lot it had 
ever been my fortune to meet. Sadie Brooke was 
the drollest and most winning shall I say the most 
audacious ? flirt that I ever saw. 

I had to go down to the office, and Pryor had to 
see the inevitable man. Sadie and Kitty Travers 
walked down with us, and then strolled on to the 
river, where I overtook them, and escorted them 
homeward. We met Mr. and Mrs. Wilbur, who 
swelled our procession. 

" I couldn't rest until Mr. Wilbur had looked in 
upon you," declared his wife. " But the party seems 
to have increased," and she glanced rather amazed at 
the new additions. 

Saturday night had become a kind of reception 
evening with us. Two of the Montgomerys were in, 



 

Charlie Wharton, Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, and their 
daughter. I was very glad to have the Wilburs 
meet some of their neighbors. 

The party talked, half a dozen at a time, and 
langhed in chorus. I do not know who first pro 
posed a picnic, but Mr. Wilbur took it up enthusi 
astically. 

" See here," he began. " I shall have to spend the 
glorious Fourth in these classic but unpatriotic 
shades. Generally I manage to take my wife off 
somewhere ; but, as this cannot be done, I ought to 
have some compensation. Is there a respectably 
level ground, with the proper degree of shade, where 
a quadrille can be danced, and the exhausted par 
ticipants loll around afterward, without danger of 
getting freckled or sun-burned ? For one, I am 
choice of my complexion. Ambrosial Balm is ex 
cellent, but dear. If you can find this favored spot, 
and will promise to let me dance with all the prettiest 
girls, I will pay the piper." 

" Excellent ! " exclaimed Sadie. " Mr. Wilbur, I 
hope you want to dance with me ? " 

Everybody laughed. 

" There's Terry's woods, you know," Dan Mont 
gomery made haste to announce. " It's cleared 
pretty well, and it isn't far." 

" Capital place," declared Pryor. " If only those 



 

who contribute will be allowed to dance, I beg to be 
placed on the cream committee at once." 

It went on taking shape ; and before one would 
have imagined it, the matter was arranged. The 
picnic was to open at three punctually, at Terry's 
woods, unless it rained. 

" If it rains, we will have to adjourn to my new 
house. I will see that they get all the floors laid on 
Monday," said Mr. Wilbur. 

" Or we might take the station," appended Joe. 
" There ought to be one jolly frolic down there in 
remembrance of old times." 

" I think of engaging it for a dancing-school next 
winter," said Eve sententiously. 

It came out that there were some amusing associa 
tions connected with it ; and Mr. Wilbur insisted that, 
as new-comers, they were entitled to a fair share of 
knowledge concerning their neighbors' affairs. Eve 
went briefly over the story of our housekeeping, set 
ting it forth in a most entertaining light. Mr. and 
Mrs. Wilbur laughed heartily. The clock struck 
eleven ; and our guests started with guilty con 
sciences, beginning to make excuses for such late 
staying. 

" The picnic is a true fact, as my little girl says," 
announced Mr. Wilbur. " No backing out. I shall 
be there promptly, with a fiddler ; and every pretty 



 

girl will be there, so we shall know in what esteem 
the truants hold themselves. Miss Brooke, I shall 
open the grand entertainment with you. My wife 
will provide her own partner, and look out that there 
is no poaching on her manor." 

"Yes, girls," said Mrs. Wilbur laughingly, "you 
may all pull straws for him after the picnic is fairly 
under way. Good-night, good-night." 

They dispersed, rather reluctantly I thought ; and 
we talked on for a good hour, I am sure. In fact, I 
heard laughs all the remainder of the night. 

Sunday morning was splendid, but rather warm. 
We all went to church< and Athens seemed to be 
amazed. The afternoon we spent up in the chestnut- 
grove with cushions, blankets, hammocks, and books. 
Some of us went to church again in the evening. 
Pryor, Mr. Bradford, and the inevitable Dan walked 
up with us, and we had some very good singing. 
Sadie managed to give Mr. Bradford an invitation 
to the picnic. Miss Travers's admirer, a Mr. Dane, 
and Frank Gaylord, had been added by the evening 
train ; so we all walked down again to see them off, 
and both declared they would be up on Tuesday. 

Pryor was in early Monday morning. Eve was to 
give herself no uneasiness about the cream, and if 
there was any thing else 

" We are going to make biscuits, and boil a ham," 



 

returned Eve. " Miss Ruth is going to supply some 
cake; Mrs. Corwin and Mrs. Wharton also. There 
will not be much for us to do." 

" Couldn't you go for a nice row late this after 
noon ? The river is so lovely, and when the heat of 
the sun is over " 

" Oh, enchanting ! " interrupted Sadie Brooke, 
coming forward. " We always row at Lake George. 
Come, let us hurry with our biscuits and things. 
If only we did not have to eat, how much time we 
might devote to other matters, fun, for instance ! " 
and her eyes were brimful of dangerous light. 

Instead of biscuits, she and Kitty Travers went 
off to ride with him. I was busy at the station, and 
in my garden picking berries. We still had a plen 
tiful supply of delicious currants, and the raspberries 
seemed never failing. We really were the envy of 
some of our neighbors, who couldn't see how we 
could get so much out of that old, neglected place. 

There came up from New York a basket of choice 
fruit and a box of confectionery. Eve declared the 
donation party had begun. By night, several cakes 
had been sent in. We went for the row, and it was 
most delightful ; the sky full of soft, fleecy white 
clouds, that now and then hid the sun, though that 
was fast dropping behind the hill. It was such a 
lovely, drowsy river, with its reaches of shade, and 



 

open spaces, and a few little settlements. One of 
the towns made quite a pretence to business, with 
its docks and several factories at the water's edge. 
But the soft golden and hazy lights, the faint breeze 
stirring the sedgy grass, or the trees higher up, and 
rippling the waters, made it a perfect picture. 
Some one repeated Tennyson's poem of " The Lotos- 
Eaters." Another gave us Robert Browning. Bertha 
Brooke contributed bits of pathos and audacity from 
Owen Meredith. Coming home, everybody sang in 
the soft summer twilight. Even now that seems one 
of the fairy touches of existence. Had I ever truly 
lived before? I glanced at Eve with her lucent 
eyes and soft-tinted cheeks, and knew she was 
enjoying herself to the uttermost. 

There was a plain little supper for us, arranged by 
Letty, who somehow entered right into the spirit of 
the affair, and served us with a kind of cheerful 
delight. Before we were through, the guests began 
to gather again, and we had a merry evening. 

Joe was as full of pleasure as any one else. Some 
times when I looked at him, I could hardly believe 
him the same lad who had come to me in such dire 
distress. Every day he seemed to grow larger and 
handsomer, and his manners were really refined, 
delicate. Had Eve worked this change ? Oddly 
enough, Pryor was less boisterous in certain ways ; 



 

and even Dan Montgomery was coming to have a 
gentlemanly air. Was it not . the contact with real 
fineness of breeding ? Eve, with all her nonsense, 
had such a gracious, charming refinement. She 
never lowered herself to people, but, in some curious 
fashion, met them on her level, drew them up to 
some better height. But it did not seem as if 
these few months could so have transformed either 
soul or body. 

We had our wish, and it was a tolerably fair 
morning ; though we all agreed it would rain before 
night, as it. always did on Fourth of July. Joe and 
Mr. Pryor went up to the ground to clear up, and 
arrange some seats ; while the girls dawdled around 
after the pretty, graceful fashion of girls of leisure. 
Mr. Wilbur took them all through his new house, 
though Mrs. WilBur declared they looked at a great 
deal of it with the eye of faith. 

Athens made a show of patriotism by now and 
then firing off a pistol, or a squad of boys congre 
gated about a pack of fire-crackers. Some of the 
larger towns around had processions and speeches : 
even our solitary and forlorn Brass Band went out 
of town. But there was quite an influx of visitors, 
and trains ran full : indeed, there were some extras. 
Joe insisted that I should go to the picnic, and 
promised to run up once or twice between trains. 



 

Dan Montgomery came over with his father's 
wagon, and offered to help carry up the " creature 
comforts," as Pryor dubbed them. Our house seemed 
to be the meeting-place, and we formed quite a pro 
cession when we started. It was over the hill above 
us, something farther to the north, a kind of natural 
clearing in the strip of woods, oak, hickory, hem 
lock, and chestnut. The short grass had been raked 
and swept. There was quite a pretentious table, two 
long plank benches, some camp-seats, several ham 
mocks hung, and three colored musicians. 

Few especial invitations had been given out : there 
had not been time. Frank Gaylord had brought a 
young Cuban up with him, who \^fas employed in the 
foreign correspondence of his uncle's business-house, 
a very gentlemanly young fellow with a rather 
handsome face and fine manners. 

" He seemed so lonely, and did not know what to 
do with himself," explained Frank to his sister and 
mine. " You see, he only came to New York last 
March, and has not made many friends ; but he's first- 
class, and I was telling him how jolly you all were 
out here." 

" Take him around, and introduce him to every 
body," said Helen. " It may not be fashionable ; but 
we are in country-wilds, and it does make a stranger 
feel more at home." 



 

Frank obeyed the behest. Manuel Estradura 
seemed a trifle abashed at first; but Sadie Brooke 
and Mr. Wilbur took him so cleverly under their 
mutual wings, that he almost became the hero of the 
occasion. His rival was Mrs. Wilbur's cousin, a Mr. 
Palmer, eight and twenty perhaps, and charming 
enough to be remarkable at a fashionable watering- 
place. Sadie declared privately that she felt utterly 
eclipsed and maddingly jealous. 

The music struck up, and the dancing began. 
Pryor was supremely happy with Eve for a partner ; 
while Dan Montgomery looked on in a rather surly 
fashion, resolving, I dare say, to acquire the art at 
the very first opportunity. In the Lancers that 
followed, Eve had Mr. Palmer, and Sadie the Cuban ; 
but in the next set Sadie was supremely content with 
the tall, distinguished stranger. 

They danced, they chatted and laughed. There 
was the quickest of repartee, the merriest of badi 
nage. It was a picture out there in the woods, a 
Watteau-like scene that harmonized admirably. Joe 
was wild with delight when he came up. They were 
just about dancing again; and he took Ruth Mont 
gomery, rather to my surprise. I thought of Eve's 
plan of attracting Pryor thitherward, but in my 
heart of hearts I knew it would not work. 

It was a happy time with youth and delight. The 



 

moments flew too rapidly. Never did music sound 
sweeter, never did sandwich, cake, cream, and lemon 
ade taste better. Is there any zest like that of the 
freshness of youth and the piquant unconventionality 
of such an occasion ? 

" There will not be any thing quite as charming at 
Lake George, I know," declared Sadie wilfully. " I 
have half a mind not to go." 

Palmer looked up quickly. 

"Are you booked for Lake George?" he asked. 
" I am to start next week with a camping-out party, 
and spend a fortnight. Are you going with a party ? " 
and he gave a mirthful glance around. 

"I am always in a party," declared Sadie. "I 
abhor solitudes and sages, and enjoy being ' in the 
midst of alarms.' Yes, my sister, Miss Fisher, Miss 
Lane, and Miss Travers, go with us. I only wish I 
could coax Eve Thurston to join, but she has spent 
one whole summer there." 

They compared notes about their respective loca 
tions, and found they were not going to be very far 
apart. Mr. Bradford, who had come up an hour or 
so before, found himself quite supplanted, and had to 
comfort his soul with Bertha. Was he really attracted 
to Sadie Brooke ? I could not imagine him choosing 
such a gay society wife ; but he was in no wise 
devoted to young women. 



 

On the homeward route Mr. Palmer was her 
escort. The young Cuban seemed curiously attracted 
to Eve. Mrs. Wilbur now informed us that she had 
made all arrangements with Mrs. Ten Eyck for our 
party to have supper there, and Mr. Wilbur had laid 
in a liberal supply of fire-works. There was a little 
demurring, but Eve was speedily overruled. 

There had been quite a number of Athenians who 
had strolled up to Terry's woods, rather curious to 
know just what was going on. We had made several 
of our friends and neighbors very welcome, and the 
breaking up was characterized by expressions of 
delight and good feeling at their venturing to trust 
our hospitality. 

" Why, we might often have pleasant little times 
like this," said Charlie Wharton. " Athens has been 
the stupidest place ; but if we only can get in 
some new people with a little vim and brains above 
a Sunday-school picnic, where you are in fear of 
children breaking their limbs, or tearing their best 
clothes ! " 

" They are well enough in their way," rejoined his 
sister-in-law, "but the older people might enjoy a 
pleasure on a different scale. And I do think we 
owe a debt or a vote of thanks to Miss Thurston for 
stirring up the Rip Van Winkles." 

" Yes," declared Pryor. " Thurston, you will yet 



 

be the light and regeneration of Athens. When we 
come to get some business and some new people " 

"And a hotel,  ' interrupted Sadie. "Put Miss 
Thurston in as business manager." 

"And I will do my best toward filling it," said 
Mr. Wilbur. 

Eve, Joe, and I paused a few moments at the 
house. Joe was to do the chores. I ran down to 
the station, and attended to the up and down trains. 
When I reached Mrs. Ten Eyck's, I found Pryor 
and Mr. Bradford had both accepted the invitation. 
Indeed, it was quite a party. Mrs. Wilbur was mis 
tress of ceremonies, and we did have a gay time. 
Afterward we went out on the porch. It was quite 
cloudy, so it was considered prudent to have the fire 
works at once, as the children were eager for them. 

So we ended with a patriotic glorification. Our 
day had been a great success. Frank Gaylord and 
Estradura were going on the train, but Palmer had 
accepted Mrs. Wilbur's invitation to remain a few 
days longer. We saw the travellers off, with decla 
rations on their part that they had found Athens 
delightful. 

The next morning Joe and I were very busy, and 
the girls had the house to themselves. But in the 
afternoon they all went off driving with Palmer and 
Mrs. Wilbur. Indeed, they were so late that Letty 



 

and Joe had supper all ready when they came 
home. Mr. Bradford and Pryor were both up that 
evening. 

Mr. Wilbur's house was progressing so rapidly, 
that they had decided to get in before it was all 
finished, and resolved to move about the middle of 
the month ; though Mrs. Wilbur explained the case 
more fully to Eve. They had some friends who 
would like to board with the Ten Eycks, but who 
wanted to get out in the country by that time, and 
Mrs. Ten Eyck would be pleased to have them come, 
a married couple with a son and daughter. The 
Wilburs did not intend to furnish very elaborately. 
Most of the floors were hard wood or stained, and 
Mrs. Wilbur promised herself much pleasure talking 
matters over with Eve. Both husband and wife had 
taken an immense fancy to Joe. 

Indeed, Joe developed such a multifarious genius 
that I was sometimes quite amazed. He was like a 
woman in the "short cuts" he took to accomplish 
his object. If he did not get a satisfactory result 
one way, he used another. Some of his suggestions 
were so excellent that Mr. Wilbur placed the arrange 
ment of the grounds and several other matters in his 
hands. A nice barn was to be built through the fall, 
and next year they would keep a horse and a cow. 

Already Joe had begun to save some money. He 



 

had bought a nice, inexpensive summer-suit, and was 
paying for a watch on instalments. His parcel busi 
ness was considerable, and the regular expressman of 
the town looked sourly at him. He had also made a 
contract with several ladies in Athens, elderly peo 
ple, to take them to drive now and then, bring them 
to the station when they needed to go to the city, 
and take them home. His prices were so low, that 
Pryor quite laughed at him at first ; but when he 
made seventy-five cents on some days, and had the 
pleasure besides, he felt quite elated. 

" Thurston, next year I'll have a horse, you see if 
I don't," he said confidently to me. " I've made up 
my mind that Tm going to see if I can't get my 
share of the world's wealth that Miss Eve was 
explaining to me one day. It looks like a big thing, 
to set out for eight hundred dollars ; but I dare say 
if I hadn't stumbled over you ^s I did that day, I 
should drink up that amount in ten years ; so I just 
said to myself, 'If you can afford to drink up that 
sum in beer and rum, you can afford to save it.' 
And money does help you to make money. O 
Thurston ! I can never be grateful enough to you and 
Miss Eve," and Joe's eyes were limpid with tears. 

Certainly, even this was worth doing. And it 
seemed, with a helping hand now and then, that 
Joe might be a success for himself. Cities were 



 

full enough of young men crowding each other for 
bread, and even here Joe was making more clear 
money than in any position he was likely to get. 
The thought of his future troubled me now and 
then, whether, indeed, this was a good business 
discipline for the man. 

Thursday was crowded full of pleasure. The 
girls were to go back on Friday, except Miss 
Gaylord, who was to rejoin some relatives at Long 
Branch on the first of August. Now she proposed 
to spend the intervening weeks at Athens. 

" It will be very pleasant to have her," said Eve. 
" I have been so used to some society and companion 
ship, that I must be let down easily;" and she 
laughed gayly. 

Mrs. Brooke sent an invitation for Eve to 
accompany them to Lake George, and remain a 
fortnight ; and Sadie insisted that she should consent. 

"Indeed, I cannot!" said Eve. "I must finish up 
my painting-class and feome music-lessons, and make 
some fine attire. Then I am to go to Saratoga to 
Mrs. Harwood." 

"Then you can surely come. We will never, 
never forgive you if you don't ! " cried the chorus. 

Eve did partly promise. 

There was a rather amusing dispute at the last. 
Eve had arranged it with me that the girls' week 



 

should be considered a visit. They had not intended 
that, but Eve pluckily held her ground. The girls 
gave in presently, and were so agreeable, that I felt 
quite certain they had settled it among themselves. 

We were all sorry to have them go. Mr. Palmer 
had remained, and joined them on their return- 
trip. Mr. Pryor and Mr. Bradford both found an 
important errand to take them to the city. The 
girls insisted that there should be another splendid 
week in the autumn. Gertie Fisher, we knew, was 
to be married. Her lover was buyer for a New- York 
house, and was now abroad ; so there might be one 
less. 

It seemed quite lonely that evening, for, strangely 
enough, no one dropped in ; but we had the 
inexpressible pleasure of going to bed early. In 
fact, we had been dreadfully dissipated. 

Frank Gaylord had written to ask if he and 
Estradura might come over on Sunday afternoon, 
and Helen had replied in the affirmative. So we 
were not likely to be utterly deserted. The quiet 
Saturday was a real pleasure. We looked after our 
young chickens. I trimmed and tied up vines, and 
took account of stock, as one might say. 

On Monday, Eve had an express parcel with the 
jolliest of letters signed by the whole five girls, who 
had endowed her with enough table-napery to last 



 

a lifetime, or furnish the hotel. They strongly 
suggested the latter. 

We liked Miss Gaylord very much. She and 
Frank were the youngest of a large family, all 
married and scattered, save these two, who were still 
under the guardianship of an uncle, who had been 
like a father to them. Helen had a small portion of 
seven thousand dollars well invested, and was about 
twenty; not quite such a madcap as some of the 
others, and a very pleasant companion. Frank was 
two years younger, a bright, smart business fellow. 
When we came to see Estradura again, we were 
much pleased. He was a fine musician, read French 
and Italian beautifully. I had half a fancy that he 
was smitten by Miss Gaylord, at which suggestion 
Eve smiled a little. 



 



CHAPTER XI 

SUMMER AND SENTIMENT 

OUR next excitement was getting Mrs. Wilbur's 
house furnished. I wondered why everybody, old, 
young, middle-aged, or between^ came to Eve for 
counsel, suggestion, and approval. Mrs. Wilbur 
carried her off to New York two days to help her 
select furniture. Every thing was to be light, airy, 
cheap, she said, but not as Eve and I counted cheap 
ness. There were willow, bamboo, splint chairs; 
rugs ; bed-room suites in maple and ash, and they 
were plain. The furniture was not to be removed in 
the winter. 

For compensation Mrs. Wilbur insisted that Eve 
should take her dressmaker for two days, and this 
was a wonderful relief. The painting-class met 
again, and Helen was much interested in it. She 
was delicately helpful in many ways. Mr. Pryor 
was their gallant, of course. 

I found a great deal to do in my garden. Weeds 
grew apace, though Joe had a curious knack of ex 
terminating them. As my raspberries ceased bearing, 
I cut out the old canes, which made quite a thinning, 



 

and trimmed back young shoots. I cut out a multi 
tude of young currants, and made a new bed of them 
in a rather shady place, to see if I could root them. 
Our chickens throve nicely. We had been culling 
out the cockerels, and using them up, and very nice 
we found them. The horse, too, proved a great satis 
faction. I gave the stable, and Joe the care ; for we 
used it the most, I found. The food we supplied by 
thirds ; and it proved not at all onerous, as she was 
an easy keeper. 

We heard from the girls. It was very jolly at 
Lake George. Mr. Palmer's camping-party was just 
magnificent. If Eve could only be there ! couldn't 
she, wouldn't she, come ? Then Mrs. Harwood wrote. 
She would be ready for Eve on the 10th of August, 
and would like to keep her a fortnight. 

" That falls in right with the painting and every 
thing," said Eve. " Some of the music-scholars will 
stop now ; but after all, I seem to have about as 
much pleasure as work." 

" You make pleasure out of every thing," I replied. 

Then a new application surprised us. Mr. Estra- 
dura came over one day to beseech Eve to open her 
hospitable home, and take him in. A friend was to
