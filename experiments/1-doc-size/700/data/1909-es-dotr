That is but gentlemanly. None the less 
the obscurity was one in which the world saw 
many things, the obviousness of the fact, for 
instance, that Sally had but stolen a march 



 

on Malakoff who, gallantly, had desisted 
from counter charges. 

Sally did not attempt to undeceive the 
world which would not have believed her had 
she tried. She did not try, however. It 
would not have suited her book to do so. She 
had another and a more agreeable task. 

De Dol meanwhile had gone, summer was 
going and Welden, issuing from the greaticed bath of death, remounted to life's sur 
face. Among other lesions, there had been 
an injury to the occipital cortex which resulted in impairment of vision. For a time 
he could not distinguish objects. When he 
succeeded, the first thing he saw was Sally. 

He resented her presence. He regarded 
it as an intrusion. Moreover, the reason of 
it was beyond him. Then from being a phe 
nomenon objectionable and occult, it became 
a phase of his condition, one that primarily 
he accepted from sheer inability to avoid 
and finally from the familiarising effects of 





habit. It is related that men who entered 
the Bastille as though it were their grave, 
had to be afterward ejected by force. They 
had got used to it and what human beings 
get used to they get to like. That was the 
case with Welden. In accounting for Sally's visits he forgot her former ambuscades 
and attributed present attentions to the ef 
fort he had made to rid the world of Malakoff. Anyway, what did it matter? Sally 
made his prison endurable. She was blithe 
as a humming bird. On the end of her fin 
gers was every kind of pretty gesture. 
They were alert too, very divinatory. They 
knew what he wanted as soon as he did. 
They omitted to be in the way. They grew 
discreet. Recognising their usefulness, 
they ceased to flutter. They took themselves away, and away remained, until their 
return was solicited. 

When that occurred Sally, even to the 
world, could no longer affect to be a miserable woman. She radiated smiles, she exhaled good humour. Dr. Binet-Valmer, 
who thoroughly approved of the presence of 
young gentlewomen in the bedrooms of convalescents, encouraged her visits. He knew 
she was only an insect but he realised that 
she was a pretty one. Without any faith in 
drugs whatever, with hardly any faith in 
anything, he yet had confidence in the tonic 
of prettiness, smiles and good humour. The 
infirmieres had too. The intendant had 
also. To them, to the trainers and stable 
men, Sally was the right sort. There was 
no end to her presents and pourboires. 

Such were her occupations. In addition 
she had another. She, too, was having a run. 

The post was a good bit off. Between her 
and it were wide ditches and tall fences. At 
any moment a tremendous crumpler might 
occur. But behind her were other obstacles, 
bigger and wider still, timber which she 
thought she could not take and which she 





had cleared without effort. Moreover, now 
she was nearing the home stretch. Provided 
she kept her seat, kept, too, a hand light, 
yet steady, luck might land her a winner, 
and at it she went, full tilt, straight ahead, 
at a pace so clinking that it accounted per 
haps for her smiles and good humour. 

It was not because of these radiations, 
hut because of others, because it was his 
destiny to do so, that Welden no longer resented her presence. He accepted it, but 
with that curious lassitude which Death, in 
revenge it may be, puts on those for whom 
it has come and not got. 

Apathetic and indifferent, he rejected 
the news of the day, ignored the cataclysms 
in Wall street, refused to see Cantire, Le 
Hillel, Lord Ferrers and the string of visitors that called. But apart from the apathy, 
apart, too, from the debility incident to his 
condition, health had returned. Long since 
his collar-bone had been mended and his 



 

ankle, treated after the setting to massage 
instead of plaster, was now but a little stiff. 

Presently, Sally prompting, these things 
he recognised and recognising also that further delay would constitute a breach of hos 
pitality, he wrote de Dol his thanks, asked 
him as an additional obligation to accept 
his hunter and, after distributing princely 
presents to the service, had himself transported to the Sign of the Swan. 

"What you need," Sally said to him that 
evening, "is a good, long sea trip. Dr. 
Binet-Valmer told me so. Don't you agree 
with him?" 

They were at table in her sitting room at 
the Hotel du Cygne where, served by Harris, they had dined. The cloth had not yet 
been removed but Harris had gone. Sally 
wore a gown in the corsage of which ochre 
and lilac were blended. Welden's evening 
coat fell about him loosely. He was smoking. 





"Don't you?" Sally repeated. 

"Yes," he answered. "But hardly alone 
and for the moment I know no one whom I 
could ask to go with me." 

Sally smiled, displaying her teeth, bits of 
mother of pearl, glistening and pointed. 

"You could ask me." 

At this prelude to the Invitation a la 
valse, Welden shrugged his shoulders. 
Men generally thought Sally very fetching. 
Her mauve eyes, oblique and half -closed, 
might have tempted saints, demons even, 
with whom she was perhaps akin. But she 
failed to represent to Welden that which 
makes some men constant not necessarily to 
one particular woman but to one particular 
feminine type. 

"Nonsense," he told her. 

"It is not nonsense at all," Sally, shaking 
her head and cocking an eye at him, retorted. 
"Why do you say so?" 

Welden considered the prelude closer. 



 

After all there was a certain worldly justice in it. Maud having taken up with Malakoff, it was perhaps nonsense for him to 
balk at taking up with Malakoff's wife. 
Jointly and severally they could combine 
for the payment of old scores. At the same 
time, between public and private payment, 
there was a margin. 

"Why do you?" Sally repeated. 

Welden lighted a fresh cigar. "I should 
be compromising you irretrievably." 

Sally sighed. "You have already," she 
promptly answered. 

From over the cigar Welden looked at 
her. About her throat was a string of 
pearls. One hand that lay invitingly on the 
table was covered with gems. But from it 
the pretty gestures had gone, from her face 
the smiles had passed. She looked virginal 
and sad, a sort of melancholy angel, only 
much better dressed than angels usually are. 
Through her half -closed eyes she watched 




him. There had been her visits to de Dol's, 
he was thinking, but that was her affair. 

"In what way?" he asked. 

"Well, you see, don't you know, every 
body says the duel was on my ac 
count." 

That alsoWelden considered. It seemed 
logical enough. On a certain night Sally 
had abandoned her husband. Within thirty- 
six hours he and that husband had fought. 
Their reasons for fighting no one, save them 
selves, Sally and Maud could possibly know. 
Clearly it was logical enough and yet insufficient to warrant the full measure of the 
Invitation. 

"Mrs. Cawtree wrote to me," Sally resumed, "and Fanny Solferino and my 
mother. My mother was very violent. My 
mother said that I had disgraced her. She 
declared that no decent person would ever 
receive me, unless 

Sally paused. Like the lady whom she 



 

was quoting, she sometimes embroidered 
the truth. 

"Unless " she presently continued, and 
paused again. 

But, as Welden manifested no interest in 
the proviso, she prodded him. 

"I don't like to tell you." 

Then, seeing that Welden had no inten 
tion of urging her, she took her courage in 
her jewelled hand. 

"Unless you marry me." 

Welden had been occupied with the logic 
of her previous statement, but the unobtrusive modesty of this announcement surprised 
him from it. 

He removed his cigar. "I had an idea 
that you were married already." 

Into the melancholy of Sally's face there 
crept a smile. "I was," she answered. "I 
am no longer." 

"Ah," said Welden. "Is Malakoff dead?" 

But now the smile in Sally's face deepened. It burrowed under the melancholy 
and tossed it aside. She laughed. 

"No, divorced. It was so amusing too. 
Shall I ten you about it? Shall I? Well, 
after I put in the petition, the judge had us 
both see him in private. Ridgeway told me 
he would. It appears that in divorce cases 
here the judge takes a sort of fatherly attitude and tries to get the parties to make 
up and, if you will believe me, he did try. 
He was so nice about it, too, that you would 
have thought he was my aunt and Malakoff 
was so rude you would have thought he was 
my mother. But the judge was really very 
nice. And so civil! Dear me, his mouth 
was just full of madame la duchesse and 
monsieur de due. Later on, in the decree, he fined his monsieur le due a hundred francs. 
Don't you think it was amusing?" 

Welden shrugged his shoulders. After 
the duel it had been grievous to him that he 
had not killed the man. Now he did not 



 

care. During the race he had tried to kill 
himself. There too he had failed. But that 
also was a matter of indifference. Before 
either race or duel he had been obsessed by 
the vision of a pillowed head. It had gone. 
Though he had failed with Malakoff and 
failed with himself, he had thoroughly assassinated that. 

"Don't you think it was amusing?" Sally 
repeated. 

"You certainly have not been idle," Weiden replied. "What were the grounds?" 

Sally made a gesture. Though there are 
things that men do, there are women who do 
not mention them. 

Welden nodded. "Who was the co?" 

"Who?" cried Sally. "Have you forgotten already? Don't you remember the night 
of the Fourth of July?" 

Welden nodded again and knocked the 
ashes from his cigar. "You are no longer, 
then, madame la duchesse." 





Smilingly Sally stood up. She moved 
from the table, dropped him a curtsy and 
sweetly, yet simply, replied: 

"I am Sally Kandy again, and yours if 
you will have me." 

"Thank you," said Welden, quite as 
though he had been offered another cup of 
coffee. "Thank you. But did not this Ridge- 
way tell you about the Court of Cassation? 
Malakoff has six months in which to appeal. 
Of course he will do nothing of the kind. 
None the less, in the interim, any marriage 
of yours would be bigamous." 

At that last word Sally flushed and sat 
down. It is possible that she had misconstrued its meaning. 

"What a dreadful expression," she ex 
claimed. "I am sure I never should think 
of anything so horrid. But, in the interim, 
as you call it, what is there to prevent us 
from going to South Africa or, better still, 
to the East?" 



 

At the door came a rap. Harris entered, 
busying himself with the cloth. Welden got 
up and limped to the window. 

In the park without, leaves were falling, 
falling from branch to branch; falling slow 
ly, as with regret; falling undecidedly with 
precaution. In their faint rustle was a 
sound such as the steps of fate may make 
when approaching furtively, a-tiptoe. 

The hesitancy of it filtered into Welden's 
thoughts. Usually, he knew what he had to 
do and did it. But illness plays strange 
tricks and destiny plays others. After all, 
he told himself, eventually there would be 
someone else. Perhaps as well then Sally 
as another. At least she would serve to show 
to Maud how indifferent he was to her. Even 
otherwise, how should it matter? How should 
anything matter any more? 

He turned. Harris had gone. Sally 
through her half -closed eyes, was watching 
him. 





"Very good," he said. "We will go to the 
Orient since you wish it." 

With a feline twist of the tongue SalJy 
moistened her lips. She had the sensation 
of being lifted lightly in the air. It was the 
last fence. She had reached the post a winner. 

Alone in his room that night Welden still 
heard the leaves. They fell slowly, solemnly, burying the past beneath their slender 
weight, raising between him and it a veil, 
tenuous and aerial. Higher it rose, higher 
still, ever higher until, sinking again, it en 
veloped memory in it. 

A fortnight later Welden and Sally, at- 
tended by their servants, embarked from 
Southampton on a voyage that took them 
first to India, where they loitered, then to 
Hong Kong, where they were married and 
finally to White Peacocks. 

There the journey ended. There, for one 
of them, eternity began. 




"Well, William, how are you? Is Miss 
Barhyte at home?" 

"Yes, sir, Miss Barhyte has just come in. 
I hope I see you very well, sir. It's a long 
time, sir " 

Taking Welden's hat and stick, the servant showed him into the library, which apparently, was unaltered. The cushions on 
the sofa were as colourful as before. Oppo 
site, the piano stood, and from the walls powdered heads looked down. But, from the 
table, the Sicilians had gone. In place of 
Greek poetry there was now a book of 





French verse. Otherwise the room was quite 
as it had been the year previous and, apart 
from a black band on the sleeve of his grey 
coat, Welden himself was unchanged. There 
was the same smile in his eyes, the same glint 
in his hair, the same appearance of suppleness and strength. 

He had opened the book and was loitering 
in its languors when William reappeared. 

"I am sorry, sir. I made a mistake. Miss 
Barhyte is not at home." 

The mistake must have been anticipated. 
Welden manifested no surprise. 

"Is the general in?" he asked, his eyes still 
on the book. 

"No, sir. The general is not at home 
either." 

But now Welden put the book aside and 
nodded. 

"Give him my compliments and say that 
I will wait on him at nine to-night. How is 
he?" 



 

"Pretty well, sir." The man moved out 
through the reception room to the marble 
of the hall, where he handed Welden his hat 
and stick. "That was a nasty accident he 
had last summer. He limps a little still. 
Yes, sir." 

Opening the door, he held it open until 
Welden reached the street. 

Welden sauntered on. Five days previous 
he had left Santa Barbara. It was but an 
hour or two before that he had reached New 
York. In his head he could still feel the motion of the cars. That would pass, he told 
himself, as all things do. It would pass, as 
would also pass a girl's disinclination to be 
at home. 

He sauntered on, turned into Fifth ave 
nue, and sauntered up. At once, a man whom 
he knew stopped him, buttonholed, ques 
tioned, platitudinised. From passing traps 
and motors, women bowed, two other men 
joined him and, at the curb, a withered creature tossed from a barrel-organ a strain of 
Italian love. 

The men annoyed him. It wearied him 
to talk about what had happened. It wearied him as much to be told about stocks. Pretexting a pretext he hailed a hansom and 
sailed away. 

Presently, at the Plaza, where he had put 
up, it was comforting to find that his luggage had arrived. After the philistinism of 
the West, it was agreeable to be lodged in 
an artistic inn. After the horrors of a transcontinental trip, it was a pleasure to dress 
at ease. After the convict fare of the Limited, food properly served was a relief. After a tragedy, a change of air is good for the 
nerves. 

Welden, as he sat at table that evening, 
his recent mourning indicated in his shirt by 
two small black studs, considered momen 
tarily these minor gifts of the minor gods. 
But he had work ahead of him and, at five 



 

minutes to nine, hailing a hansom, he sailed 
back to Madison avenue. 

At a door there, as he rang, a melody of 
Beethoven's which was being played within, 
ceased abruptly. The door opened and Wil 
liam, after taking his hat and coat, showed 
him into the dining-room where, before a 
wide table, the general sat, looking, as perhaps a general should, very fierce. 

"William," he ordered, "close the door be 
hind you." 

Then, rising, he turned at Welden. 

"Had you left your address this after 
noon, I would have warned you not to call 
here. Your conduct has been dastardly. 
Dastardly! God bless my soul, there is no 
other word for it." 

He paused, removed his glasses and shook 
them. 

"After an accident which I experienced 
and Maud had joined me at Frascati's, you 
picked a quarrel with Malakoff , induced the 




duchess to obtain a divorce and married the 
lady, married her, God bless my soul, when 
you were engaged to my daughter and to 
day, your wife barely cold in her grave, you 
have the impudence to come here. Damn 
me, sir, if I had acted as you have I would 
have come expecting the cowhide." 

As the tirade proceeded the general's voice 
mounted to the diapason of a roar. At its 
conclusion he stamped a foot. 

"Yes, damn me, the cowhide." 

Immediately, but without heat, Welden 
took it up. 

"From no other man living would I en 
dure for an instant that expression, nor yet 
the one which preceded it. But you are 
right, right, that is, from your point of view. 
It would be dastardly, and it would be the 
cowhide I should expect, if I had acted as 
you say I have, intentionally." 

"Intentionally," the general shouted. 
"Intentionally" 



 

He would have run on but Welden cut in. 

"When your daughter left Deauville I 
was on my way to Paris. She wrote me of 
your accident, telling me she was going to 
you at once, and asking me to join you both 
at Frascati's " 

"Damn me, sir, this is ancient history." 

Welden nodded. "Yes, to you and to 
your daughter. But not to me. The letter 
which your daughter wrote at Deauville on 
the morning of the Fourth of July, I received less than a fortnight since at Santa 
Barbara." 

"Even so what of it? They were not 
dumb at the Malakoff's, I suppose. They 
all knew of it. Anyone could have told 
you." 

"General, not only no one told me that 
your daughter had gone, but I was led to believe that she was still there and did not wish 
to see me." 

"Stuff and nonsense! Do you mean to say 





that you are a born fool? How could any 
one gammon you with such rubbish?" 

There are explanations which explain 
nothing. Unhesitatingly Welden advanced 
one. 

"For the very reason you have given. Because I was a fool. But however much of a 
fool I may have been I am not a knave. 
Your daughter will appreciate that." 

General Barhyte reached forward and 
touched a bell. 

"Never," he answered. "I shall not allow 
you to see her and even if I did, she would 
refuse to do so." 

The servant entered. 

"William, the door for this gentleman." 

He turned his back, took up an evening 
paper and sat down. To him Welden had 
apparently ceased to exist. 

But Welden was thoroughly alive. Preceded by William, he passed into the drawing room and on to the hall. There, after 



 

getting his hat and coat, instead of going 
out, he turned into the reception room and 
went through it to the library beyond. 

At the piano, a sheet of music before her, 
was a girl who, as he entered, turned slowly 
and slowly arose. 

Welden, his hat in his hand, his coat on 
his arm, looked at her. Unlike the room, she 
had altered. The allurement of her face, the 
caress which she had exhaled, the charm of 
manner which always she had conveyed, 
these emanations were absent. In place of 
allurement was blankness ; in lieu of the caress was rigidity; instead of the charm, a 
chill. In her eyes and about her mouth was 
an expression of distant inquiry, an air of 
saying: Who are you and what do you 
want? 

Welden, prepared for the situation, began 
methodically at its demolition. 

"Maud, there has been that between us 
which I know you will come to believe justifies me in disregarding any instructions you 
may have given, your father's orders as well. 
When I returned the sapphire 

Insecure in her intrenchments the girl let 
fire. "It was your right to do so. It was 
a right which I had given you and expressly 
stipulated that you should use. In return 
ing it you said everything there was to be 
said. There can be nothing to add to 
it." 

"When I returned the sapphire," Welden 
continued, "it was because I thought you 
wished it." 

"You may or may not have been mistaken, 
but you cannot possibly have been as mis 
taken in me as I have been in you." 

"When I returned the sapphire," Welden 
persisted, "it was because I believed I had 
seen you in Malakoff's arms." 

For a second, with diligent disdain, the 
girl considered him. Then at once, after the 
fashion which royalty has devised to signify 



 

that a conversation is at an end, she moved 
back. 

Welden had been prepared for that also. 

"Do you recall our last night together?" 

At the memory evoked, the girl coloured 
and the disdain mounting with the flush, in 
creased, accentuated by the wantonness of 
the question. 

"Forgive me for referring to it," Welden 
added. "But that night when I entered your 
room, the disposition of it was such that I 
saw at first but your head. The next night 
I saw you as before, with this difference
