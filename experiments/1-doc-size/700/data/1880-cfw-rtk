Gardiston ? " said the little bachelor, pausing gravely by the 
table, one hand resting on its shining mahogany, the other 
extended in the attitude of surprise. 

" Yes, Cousin Copeland, you do. But these are officers of 
the United States army, and you know Aunt Margaretta's 
feelings regarding them." 

" True," said Cousin Copeland, dropping his arm ; " you 
are right ; I had forgotten. But it is a very sad state of 
things, my dear very sad. It was not so in the old days at 
Gardiston House : then we should have invited them to din 
ner." 

" We could not do that," said Gardis thoughtfully, " on 
account of forks and spoons ; there would not be enough to 
go But I would not invite them anyway," she added, the 



color rising in her cheeks, and her eyes flashing. " Are they 
not our enemies, and the enemies of our country ? Vandals ? 
Despots ? " 

"Certainly," said Cousin Copeland, escaping from these 
signs of feminine disturbance with gentle haste. Long be 
fore, he was accustomed to remark to a bachelor friend that 
an atmosphere of repose was best adapted to his constitution 
and to his work. He therefore now retired to the first wife 
of the second cousin of his grandfather, and speedily forgot 
all about the camp and the officers. Not so Gardis. Putting 
on her straw hat, she went out into the garden to attend to 
her flowers and work off her annoyance. Was it annoyance, 
or excitement merely ? She did not know. But she did know 
that the grove was full of men and tents, and she could see 
several of the blue-coats fishing in the river. "Very well," 
she said to herself hotly ; " we shall have no dinner, then ! " 
But the river was not hers, and so she went on clipping the 
roses, and tying back the vines all the long bright afternoon, 
until old Dinah came to call her to dinner. As she went, the 
bugle sounded from the grove, and she seemed to be obeying 
its summons ; instantly she sat down on a bench to wait until 
its last echo had died away. " I foresee that I shall hate that 
bugle," she said to herself. 

The blue-coats were encamped in the grove three long 
months. Captain Newell and the lieutenant, Roger Saxton, 
made no more visits at Gardiston House ; but, when they 
passed by and saw the little mistress in the garden or at the 
window, they saluted her with formal courtesy. And the 
lieutenant looked back ; yes, there was no doubt of that the 
lieutenant certainly looked back, Saxton was a handsome 
youth ; tall and finely formed, he looked well in his uniform, 
and knew it. Captain Newell was not so tall a gray-eyed, 
quiet young man. " Commonplace," said Miss Gardis. The 
bugle still gave forth its silvery summons. " It is insupport 
able," said the little mistress daily ; and daily Cousin Copeland 
replied, " Certainly." But the bugle sounded on all the same. 




One day a deeper wrath came. Miss Duke discovered 
Dinah in the act of taking cakes to the camp to sell to the 
soldiers ! 

" Well, Miss Gardis, dey pays me well for it, and we's 
next to not ing laid up for de winter," replied the old woman 
anxiously, as the irate little mistress forbade the sale of so 
much as " one kernel of corn." 

" Dey don't want de corn, but dey pays well for de cakes, 
dearie Miss Gardis. Yer see, yer don't know not ing about 
it ; it's only ole Dinah makin a little money for herself and 
Pomp," pleaded the faithful creature, who would have given 
her last crumb for the family, and died content. But Gardis 
sternly forbade all dealings with the camp from that time 
forth, and then she went up to her room and cried like a child. 
" They knew it, of course," she thought ; " no doubt they 
have had many a laugh over the bakery so quietly carried on 
at Gardiston House. They are capable of supposing even 
that /sanctioned it." And with angry tears she fell to plan 
ning how she could best inform them of their mistake, and 
overwhelm them with her scorn. She prepared several crush 
ing little speeches, and held them in reserve for use ; but the 
officers never came to Gardiston House, and of course she 
never went to the camp no, nor so much as looked that way ; 
so there was no good opportunity for delivering them. One 
night, however, the officers did come to Gardiston House 
not only the officers, but all the men ; and Miss Duke was 
very glad to see them. 

It happened in this way. The unhappy State had fallen 
into the hands of double-faced, conscienceless whites, who 
used the newly enfranchised blacks as tools for their evil pur 
poses. These leaders were sometimes emigrant Northerners, 
sometimes renegade Southerners, but always rascals. In the 
present case they had inflamed their ignorant followers to 
riotous proceedings in the city, and the poor blacks, fancying 
that the year of jubilee had come, when each man w;&gt;s to 
have a plantation, naturally began by ejecting the resident 




owners before the grand division of spoils. At least this was 
their idea. During the previous year, when the armies were 
still marching through the land, they had gone out now and 
then in a motiveless sort of way and burned the fine planta 
tion residences near the city ; and now, chance having brought 
Gardiston to their minds, out they came, inconsequent and 
reasonless as ever, to burn Gardiston. But they did not know 
the United States troops were there. 

There was a siege of ten minutes, two or three volleys 
from the soldiers, and then a disorderly retreat ; one or two 
wounded were left on the battle-field (Miss Duke's flower- 
garden), and the dining-room windows were broken. Beyond 
this there was no slaughter, and the victors drew off their 
forces in good order to the camp, leaving the officers to receive the thanks of the household Cousin Copeland, envel 
oped in a mammoth dressing-gown that had belonged to his 
grandfather, and Gardis, looking distractingly pretty in a has 
tily donned short skirt and a little white sack (she had no 
dressing-gown), with her brown hair waving over her shoul 
ders, and her cheeks scarlet from excitement. Roger Saxton 
fell into love on the spot : hitherto he had only hovered, as it 
were, on the border. 

" Had you any idea she was so exquisitely beautiful ? " he 
exclaimed, as they left the old house in the gray light of 
dawn. 

" Miss Duke is not exquisitely beautiful ; she is not even 
beautiful," replied the slow-voiced Newell. " She has the 
true Southern colorless, or rather cream-colored, complexion, 
and her features are quite irregular." 

" Colorless ! I never saw more beautiful coloring in my 
life than she had to-night," exclaimed Saxton. 

" To-night, yes ; I grant that. But it took a good-sized 
riot to bring it to the surface," replied the impassive captain. 

A guard was placed around the house at night and pickets 
sent down the road for some time after this occurrence. Gar 
dis, a prey to conflicting feelings, deserted her usual haunts 




and shut herself up in her own room, thinking, thinking what 
she ought to do. In the mean time, beyond a formal note of 
inquiry delivered daily by a wooden-faced son of Mars, the 
two officers made no effort toward a further acquaintance ; 
the lieutenant was on fire to attempt it, but the captain held 
him back. " It is her place to make the advances now," he 
said. It was ; and Gardis knew it. 

One morning she emerged from her retreat, and with a 
decided step sought Cousin Copeland in his study. The little 
man had been disquieted by the night attack ; it had come to 
him vaguely once or twice since then that perhaps there 
might be other things to do in the world besides copying 
family documents ; but the nebula it was not even a definite 
thought had faded, and now he was at work again with 
more ardor than ever. 

" Cousin Copeland," said Gardis, appearing at the door of 
the study, " I have decided at last to yield to your wishes, and 
and invite the officers to dinner." 

" By all means," said Cousin Copeland, putting down his 
pen and waving his hands with a hearty little air of acquies 
cence " by all means." It was not until long afterward that 
he remembered he had never expressed any wish upon the 
subject whatever. But it suited Gardis to imagine that he 
had done so ; so she imagined it. 

" We have little to work with," continued the little mis 
tress of the house i " but Dinah is an excellent cook, and 
and O cousin, I do not wish to do it ; I can not bear the 
mere thought of it ; but oh ! we must, we must." Tears 
stood in her eyes as she concluded. 

" They are going soon," suggested Cousin Copeland, hesi 
tatingly, biting the end of his quill. 

" That is the very reason. They are going soon, and we 
have done nothing to acknowledge their aid, their courtesy 
we Gardistons, both of us. They have saved our home, per 
haps our lives ; and we we let them go without a word ! 
O cousin, it must not be. Something we must do ; noblesse 



OLD CARD IS TON. llg 

oblige ! I have thought and thought, and really there is no 
thing but this : we must invite them to dinner," said Miss 
Duke, tragically. 

" I I always liked little dinners," said Cousin Copeland, 
in a gentle, assenting murmur. 

Thus it happened that the officers received two formal 
little notes with the compliments of Miss Gardiston Duke in 
closed, and an invitation to dinner. " Hurrah ! " cried Saxton. 
" At last ! " 

The day appointed was at the end of the next week ; 
Gardis had decided that that would be more ceremonious. 
" And they are to understand," she said proudly, " that it is 
a mere dinner of ceremony, and not of friendship." 

" Certainly," said Cousin Copeland. 

Old Dinah was delighted. Gardis brought out some of 
the half-year rent money, and a dinner was planned, of few 
dishes truly, but each would be a marvel of good cooking, 
as the old family servants of the South used to cook when 
time was nothing to them. It is not much to them now ; but 
they have heard that it ought to be, and that troubles the per 
fection of their pie-crust. There was a little wine left in the 
wine-room a queer little recess like a secret chamber ; and 
there was always the crocodile china and the few pieces of 
cut glass. The four forks would be enough, and Gardis 
would take no jelly, so that the spoons would serve also ; in 
fact, the dinner was planned to accommodate the silver. So 
far, so good. But now as to dress ; here the poor little mis 
tress was sadly pinched. She knew this ; but she hoped to 
make use of a certain well-worn changeable silk that had be 
longed to Miss Margaretta, in hue a dull green and purple. 
But, alas ! upon inspection she discovered that the faithful 
garment had given way at last, after years of patient service, 
and now there was nothing left but mildew and shreds. The 
invitation had been formally accepted ; the dinner was in course 
of preparation : what should she do ? She had absolutely no 
thing, poor child, save the two faded old lawns which she 





wore ordinarily, and the one shabby woolen dress for cooler 
weather. " If they were anything but what they are," she 
said to herself, after she had again and again turned over the 
contents of her three bureau drawers, " I would wear my 
every-day dress without a moment's thought or trouble. But 
I will not allow these men, belonging to the despot army of 
the North, these aliens forced upon us by a strong hand and 
a hard fate, to smile at the shabby attire of a Southern lady." 
She crossed the hall to Miss Margaretta's closed room : 
she would search every corner ; possibly there was something 
she did not at the moment recall. But, alas ! only too well 
did she know the contents o f the closet and the chest of draw 
ers, the chest of drawers and the closet ; had she not been 
familiar with every fold and hue from her earliest childhood ? 
Was there nothing else ? There was the cedar chamber, a 
little cedar cupboard in the wall, where Miss Margaretta kept 
several stately old satin bonnets, elaborate structures of a past 
age. Mechanically Gardis mounted the steps, and opened 
the little door half-way up the wall. The bonnets were there, 
and with them several packages ; these she took down and 
opened. Among various useless relics of finery appeared, at 
last, one whole dress ; narrow-skirted, short, with a scantily 
fashioned waist, it was still a complete robe of its kind, in 
color a delicate blue, the material clinging and soft like Can 
ton crape. Folded with the dress were blue kid slippers and 
a silk belt with a broad buckle. The package bore a label 
with this inscription, " The gown \vithin belonged to my 
respected mother, Pamela Gardiston," in the handwriting of 
Miss Margaretta ; and Gardis remembered that she had seen 
the blue skirt once, long ago, in her childhood. But Miss 
Margaretta allowed no prying, and her niece had been trained 
to ask permission always before entering her apartment, and 
to refrain from touching anything, unless asked to do so while 
there. Now the poverty-stricken little hostess carried the 
relics carefully across to her own room, and, locking the door, 
attired herself, and anxiously surveyed the effect. The old- 




fashioned gown left her shoulders and arms bare, the broad 
belt could not lengthen the short waist, and the skirt hardly 
covered her ankles. " I can wear my old muslin cape, but 
my arms will have to show, and my feet too," she thought, 
with nervous distress. The creased blue kid slippers were 
full of little holes and somewhat mildewed, but the girl 
mended them bravely ; she said to herself that she need only 
walk down to the dining-room and back ; and, besides, the 
rooms would not be brightly lighted. If she had had any 
thing to work with, even so much as one yard of material, she 
would have made over the old gown ; but she had absolutely 
nothing, and so she determined to overcome her necessities 
by sheer force of will. 

" How do I look, cousin ? " she said, appearing at the 
study-door on the afternoon of the fatal day. See spoke ner 
vously, and yet proudly, as though defying criticism. But 
Cousin Copeland had no thought of criticism. 

" My child," he said, with pleased surprise, " you look 
charming. I am very glad you have a new gown, dear, very 
glad." 

" Men are all alike," thought Gardis exultingly. " The 
others will think it is new also." 

Cousin Copeland possessed but one suit of clothes ; con 
sequently he had not been able to honor the occasion by a 
change of costume ; but he wore a ruffled shirt and a flower 
in his buttonhole, and his countenance was sedately illumined 
by the thought of the festal board below. He was not at 
work, but merely dabbling a little on the outer edges mak 
ing flourishes at the ends of the chapters, numbering pages, 
and so forth. Gardis had gone to the drawing-room ; she 
longed to see herself from head to foot, but, with the excep 
tion of the glasses in two old pier-tables, there was no large 
mirror save the gauze-veiled one in the drawing-room. 
Should she do it ? Eve listened to the tempter, and fell. 
Likewise Gardis. A scissors, a chair, a snip, and lo ! it was 
done. There she was, a little figure in a quaint blue gown, 





the thick muslin cape hiding the neck, but the dimpled arms 
bare almost to the shoulder, since the sleeve was but a narrow 
puff ; the brown hair of this little image was braided around 
the head like a coronet ; the wistful face was colorless and 
sad ; in truth, there seemed to be tears in the brown eyes. 
" I will not cry," said Gardis, jumping down from her chair, 
" but I do look odd ; there is no doubt of that." Then she 
remembered that she should not have jumped, on account of 
the slippers, and looked anxiously down ; but the kid still 
held its place over the little feet, and, going to the piano, the 
young mistress of the manor began playing a gay little love- 
song, as if to defy her own sadness. Before it was finished, 
old Pompey, his every-day attire made majestic by a large, 
stiffly starched collar, announced the guests, and the solem 
nities began. 

Everything moved smoothly, however. Cousin Copeland's 
conversation was in its most flowing vein, the simple little 
dinner was well cooked and served, Pompey was statuesque, 
and the two guests agreeable. They remained at the table 
some time, according to the old Gardiston custom, and then, 
the ends of wax-candles having been lighted in the drawing- 
room, coffee was served there in the crocodile cups, and Miss 
Duke sang one or two songs. Soon after the officers took 
leave. Captain Newell bowed as he said farewell, but Roger 
Saxton, younger and more impulsive, extended his hand. 
Miss Duke made a stately courtesy, with downcast eyes, as 
though she had not observed it ; but by her heightened color 
the elder guest suspected the truth, and smiled inwardly at 
the proud little reservation. " The hand of Douglas is his 
own," he said to himself. 

The dreaded dinner was over, and the girl had judged 
correctly : the two visitors had no suspicion of the antiquity 
of the blue gown. 

" Did you ever see such a sweet little picture, from the 
pink rose in the hair down to the blue slipper ! " said Saxton 
enthusiastically. 







" She looked well," replied Newell ; " but as for cordiality 

" I'll win that yet. I like her all the better for her little 
ways," said the lieutenant. " I suppose it is only natural that 
Southern girls should cherish bitterness against us ; although, 
of course, she is far too young to have lost a lover in the war 
far too young." 

" Which is a comfort," said Newell dryly. 

" A great comfort, old man. Don't he bearish, now, but 
just wait a while and see." 

" Precisely what I intend to do," said Newell. 

In the mean time Gardis, in the privacy of her own room, 
was making a solemn funeral pyre on the hearth, composed 
of the blue gown, the slippers, and the pink rose, and watch 
ing the flame as it did its work. " So perish also the enemies 
of my country ! " she said to herself. (She did not mean ex 
actly that they should be burned on funeral pyres, but merely 
consigned them on this, as on all occasions, to a general per 
dition.) The old dress was but a rag, and the slippers were 
worthless ; but, had they been new and costly, she would have 
done the same. Had they not been desecrated ? Let them 
die! 

It was, of course, proper that the guests should call at 
Gardiston House within a day or two ; and Roger Saxton, ig 
noring the coldness of his reception, came again and again. 
He even sought out Cousin Copeland in his study, and won 
the heart of the old bachelor by listening a whole morning to 
extracts from the documents. Gardis found that her reserve 
was of no avail against this bold young soldier, who followed 
her into all her little retreats, and paid no attention to her 
stinging little speeches. Emboldened and also angered by 
what she deemed his callousness, she every day grew more 
and more open in her tone, until you might have said that 
she, as a unit, poured out upon his head the whole bitterness 
of the South. Saxton made no answer until the time came 
for the camp to break up, the soldiers being ordered back to 
the city. Then he came to see her one afternoon, and sat for 





some time in silence ; the conversation of the little mistress 
was the same as usual. 

" I forgive this, and all the bitter things you have said to 
me, Gardis," he remarked abruptly. 

" Forgive ! And by what right, sir 

" Only this : I love you, dear." And then he poured out 
all the tide of his young ardor, and laid his heart and his 
life at her feet. 

But the young girl, drawing her slight figure up to its full 
height, dismissed him with haughty composure. She no 
longer spoke angrily, but simply said, " That you, a Northern 
er and a soldier, should presume to ask for the hand of a 
Southern lady, shows, sir, that you have not the least com 
prehension of us or of our country." Then she made him a 
courtesy and left the room. The transformation was com 
plete ; it was no longer the hot-tempered girl flashing out in 
biting little speeches, but the woman uttering the belief of 
her life. Saxton rode off into town that same night, dejected 
and forlorn. 

Captain Newell took his leave a day later in a different 
fashion ; he told Miss Duke that he would leave a guard on 
the premises if she wished it. 

" I do not think it will be necessary," answered the lady. 

" Nor do I ; indeed, I feel sure that there will be no fur 
ther trouble, for we have placed the whole district under mili 
tary rule since the last disturbance. But I thought possibly 
you might feel timid." 

" I am not timid, Captain Newell." 

The grave captain stroked his mustache to conceal a 
smile, and then, as he rose to go, he said : " Miss Duke, I 
wish to say to you one thing. You know nothing of us, of 
course, but I trust you will accept my word when I say 
that Mr. Saxton is of good family, that he is well educated, 
and that he is heir to a fair fortune. What he is personally 
you have seen for yourself a frank, kind-hearted, manly 
young fellow." 



" Did you come here to plead his cause ? " said the girl 
scornfully. 

" No ; I came here to offer you a guard, Miss Duke, for 
the protection of your property. But at the same time I 
thought it only my duty to make you aware of the real value 
of the gift laid at your feet." 

" How did you know " began Gardis. 

" Roger tells me everything," replied the officer. " If it 
were not so, I " Here he paused ; and then, as though he 
had concluded to say no more, he bowed and took leave. 

That night Gardiston House was left to itself in the forest 
stillness. " I am glad that bugle is silenced for ever," said 
Gardis. 

" And yet it was a silvern sound," said Cousin Copeland. 

The rains began, and there was no more walking abroad ; 
the excitement of the summer and the camp gone, in its place 
came the old cares which had been half forgotten. (Care 
always waits for a cold or a rainy day.) Could the little house 
hold manage to live live with their meager comforts until 
the next payment of rent came in ? That was the question. 

Bitterly, bitterly poor was the whole Southern country in 
those dreary days after the war. The second year was worse 
than the first ; for the hopes that had buoyed up the broken 
fortunes soon disappeared, and nothing was left. There was 
no one to help Gardis Duke, or the hundreds of other women in 
like desolate positions. Some of the furniture and ornaments 
of the old house might have been sold, could they have been 
properly brought forward in New York City, where there were 
people with purses to buy such things ; but in the South no 
one wanted Chinese images, and there was nothing of intrinsic 
value. So the little household lived along, in a spare, pinched 
way, until, suddenly, final disaster overtook them : the tenant 
of the warehouse gave up his lease, declaring that the old 
building was too ruinous for use ; and, as no one succeeded 
him, Gardiston House beheld itself face to face with starvation. 

" If we wasn't so old, Pomp and me, Miss Gardis, we could 





work for yer," said Dinah, with great tears rolling down her 
wrinkled cheeks ; " but we's just good for not ing now." 

Cousin Copeland left his manuscripts and wandered aim 
lessly around the garden for a day or two ; then the little man 
rose early one morning and walked into the city, with the 
hopeful idea of obtaining employment as a clerk. " My hand 
writing is more than ordinarily ornate, I think," he said to 
himself, with proud confidence. 

Reaching the town at last, he walked past the stores sev 
eral times and looked timidly within ; he thought perhaps 
some one would see him, and come out. But no one came ; 
and at last he ventured into a clothing-store, through a grove 
of ticketed coats and suspended trousers. The proprietor of 
the establishment, a Northern Hebrew whose venture had not 
paid very- well, heard his modest request, and asked what he 
could do. 

"I can write," said Cousin Copeland, with quiet pride; 
and in answer to a sign he climbed up on a tall stool and pro 
ceeded to cover half a sheet of paper in his best style. As he 
could not for the moment think of anything else, he wrote 
out several paragraphs from the last family document. 

" Richard, the fourth of the name, a descendant on the 
maternal side from the most respected and valorous family " 

" Oh, we don't care for that kind of writing ; it's old-fash 
ioned," said Mr. Ottenheimer, throwing down the paper, and 
waving the applicant toward the door with his fat hand. " I 
don't want my books frescoed." 

Cousin Copeland retired to the streets again with a new 
sensation in his heart. Old-fashioned ? Was it old-fash 
ioned ? And even if so, was it any the less a rarely attained 
and delicately ornate style of writing ? He could not under 
stand it. Weary with the unaccustomed exercise, he sat 
down at last on the steps of a church an old structure whose 
spire bore the marks of bomb-shells sent in from the block 
ading fleet outside the bar during those months of dreary 
siege and thought he would refresh himself with some fur- 





tive mouthfuls of the corn-bread hidden in his pocket for 
lunch. 

" Good morning, sir," said a voice, just as he had drawn 
forth his little parcel and was opening it behind the skirt of 
his coat. " When did you come in from Gardiston ? " 

It was Captain Newell. With the rare courtesy which 
comes from a kind heart, he asked no questions regarding the 
fatigue and the dust-powdered clothes of the little bachelor, 
and took a seat beside him as though a church-step on a city 
street was a customary place of meeting. 

" I was about to to eat a portion of this corn-bread," 
said Cousin Copeland, hesitatingly ; " will you taste it also ? " 

The young officer accepted a share of the repast gravely, 
and then Cousin Copeland told his story. He was a simple 
soul. Miss Margaretta would have made the soldier believe 
she had come to town merely for her own lofty amusement or 
to buy jewels. It ended, however, in the comfortable eating 
of a good dinner at the hotel, and a cigar in Captain Newell's 
own room, which was adorned with various personal appli 
ances for comfort that astonished the eyes of the careful little 
bachelor, and left him in a maze of vague wonderings. Young 
men lived in that way, then, nowadays ? They could do so, 
and yet not be persons of of irregular habits ? 

David Newell persuaded his guest to abandon, for the 
present, all idea of obtaining employment in the city. " These 
shopkeepers are not capable of appreciating qualifications 
such as yours, sir," he said. "Would it not be better to set 
about obtaining a new tenant for the warehouse ? " 

Cousin Copeland thought it would ; but repairs were 
needed, and 

" Will you give me the charge of it ? I am in the city all 
the time, and I have acquaintances among the Northerners 
who are beginning to come down here with a view of engag 
ing in business." 

Cousin Copeland gladly relinquished the warehouse, and 
then, after an hour's rest, he rode gallantly back to Gardiston 





House on one of the captain's horses ; he explained at some 
length that he had been quite a man of mettle in his youth as 
regards horse-flesh " often riding, sir, ten and fifteen miles a 
day." 

" I will go in for a moment, I think," said the young offi 
cer, as they arrived at the old gate. 

" Most certainly," said Cousin Copeland cordially ; " Gar- 
dis will be delighted to see you." 

" Will she ? " said the captain. 

Clouds had gathered, a raw wind from the ocean swept 
over the land, and fine rain was beginning to fall. The house 
seemed dark and damp as the two entered it. Gardis listened 
to Cousin Copeland's detailed little narrative in silence, and 
made no comments while he was present ; but when he left 
the room for a moment she said abruptly : 

" Sir, you will make no repairs, and you will take no steps 
toward procuring a tenant for our property in the city. I will 
not allow it." 

" And why may I not do it as well as any other person ? " 
said Captain Newell. 

" You are not any other person, and you know it," said 
Gardis, with flushed cheeks. " I do not choose to receive a 
favor from your hands." 

" It is a mere business transaction, Miss Duke." 

" It is not. You know you intend to make the repairs 
yourself," cried the girl passionately. 

" And if I do so intend ? It will only be advancing the 
money, and you can pay me interest if you like. The city 
will certainly regain her old position in time ; my venture is a 
sure one. But I wish to assist you, Miss Duke ; I do not 
deny it." 

" And I will not allow it ! " 

" What will you do, then ? " 

" God knows," said Gardis. " But I would rather starve 
than accept assistance from you." Her eyes were full of tears 
as she spoke, but she held her head proudly erect 




" And from Saxton ? He has gone North, but he would 
be so proud to help you." 

" From him least of all." 

" Because of his love for you ? " 

Gardis was silent. 

"Miss Duke, let me ask you one question. If you had 
loved Roger Saxton, would you have married him ? " 

" Never ! " 

" You would have sacrificed your whole life, then, for the 
sake of " 

" My country, sir." 

" We have a common country, Gardis," answered the young 
man gravely. Then, as he rose, " Child," he said, " I shall 
not relinquish the charge of your property, given into my 
hands by Mr. Copeland Gardiston, and, for your own sake, I 
beg you to be more patient, more gentle, as becomes a wo 
man. A few weeks will no doubt see you released from even 
your slight obligation to me : you will have but a short time 
to wait." 

Poor Gardis ! Her proud scorn went for nothing, then ? 
She was overridden as though she had been a child, and even 
rebuked for want of gentleness. The drawing-room was
