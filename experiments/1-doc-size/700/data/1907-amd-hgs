“ No, it wouldn’t; it would mortify me. 
I'd much rather not stand at all!” she ex- 
claimed honestly. 

“ There will be two candidates. Haven’t 
you learned that the bitter sometimes comes 
instead of the sweet? The loser will have to 
take it philosophically. And, Helen, it is an 
honor. I think the girls will all want you.” 

“ I am ashamed,” Helen began after a 
pause. “ Who is the other?” 

“ Emily Cross.” 

“ Well, she is very effective, more truly 
ornamental than I should be. She and Miss 
Saybrook were great friends last year. Oh, 
why didn’t they take Miss Saybrook! She is 
brilliant and — fascinating, when she chooses.” 

“ And she had the finest spreads; nut cake, 
pound cake, boxes of nuts picked out, choicest 
confections. She has a way of wanting you 
to believe she values your society for your 
personal qualities, respects your opinions, and 



really flatters, I think. How she managed to 
pass I cannot divine. She is superficial and 
insincere, bright, amusing, rather audacious. 
I wonder why she came to college, unless it 
was for the fun and variety. What would she 
do if she were thrown on her own resources? 
Such a girl would not adorn a position that 
demanded any of the higher qualities. That 
sounds unkind, but such girls never do credit 
to college training, but bring it into disrepute 
rather, and it always hurts me to have them 
quoted as examples. Then, think of your fine 
and noble Miss Bradshaw ! The whole class 
admired her; the teachers, as well.” 

That was true enough. 

Miss Grant was nominated unanimously. 
There was little need of a second candidate, 
and in the week before the election every girl 
expressed her satisfaction in the choice. 

Miss Cross accepted the compliment at first 
with a good deal of pleasure, but she saw the 
trend of the matter and considered herself 
rather ill-used in being made merely a foil. 

“ If you want to raise yourself in the esteem 
of the class,” said a friendly, sensible girl, 




“ withdraw your name at the beginning of 
the balloting. Just make a neat little speech, 
and advise your followers, for you would have 
some, of course, to vote for Miss Grant.” 

“ I suppose there is no chance, not even for 
vice-president,” rather reluctantly. She did 
covet some of the honors. 

“ The ticket is made up, you see. No, that 
is your best move. There are some other 
offices; we are not half through.” 

Miss Cross wrote and rewrote her declina- 
tion, and had a friend go over it. Then she 
committed it to memory, and it was very ef- 
fectively done, winning for her no little com- 
mendation. It was much nicer than being a 
defeated candidate. 

It was a beautiful autumn, and out-of-door 
sports were very tempting. They brought 
rosy cheeks and bright eyes, supple limbs, and 
exuberant spirits. True it was, that with some 
girls, recitations and papers suffered. The tea 
to the freshman class was a great success. 

Miss Chardavoyne was quite distant at first 
with Helen. 

“ So many people adore you,” she said, 


 

“ that my poor, little love can hardly count. 
There isn't anything much to me — I’ve been 
advised to give up some of the studies ; there's 
no use of my hammering at Greek — father 
said no girl could do it any sort of justice. 
Professor Waite recommended literature, and 
I like that. It was so lovely to come back and 
be with the girls, for it was so dreary at 
home. My sister is married now, and mother 
and father spend their time together. There 
are some gay cousins in Philadelphia, but they 
think I am queer. I’d like some one to really 
love me, but I can’t seem to choose any girl, 
though there are very pleasant likes, prefer- 
ences — no, that isn't quite it, either.” 

The wistful face with its appealing dark 
eyes went to Helen's heart. Why not do a 
little of the good work for this sweet, inno- 
cent, untrained soul? 

“ I do more than merely like you,” Helen 
said in a tender tone. “ And I want you to 
know my friend, Miss Brooks, real well ; she 
is much interested in your gift. You must 
come to our room and have a nice evening 
with us. And there is a Miss Denman who 




would like to know you. Why, there are so 
many nice students — ” 

“ But you see they have other friends. And 
when a group stand with their arms around 
each other, laughing and chatting, my heart 
aches. They come in when I ask them to 
tea, but somehow, I can’t be full of fun and 
jests and those witty replies they make to each 
other. Why, I sometimes think I must be 
queer ! ” 

Helen gave her a hug ; and then they ran 
across Lorraine, who in her turn felt a little 
defrauded of the intimacy she had counted 
on. True, she saw Helen every day and met 
her in the chapel, the library, and the Stu- 
dents’ Association, and she, too, was a wel- 
come visitor in Miss Morse’s room. 

Helen soon fell into the routine duties of 
her office, and made a charming president. 
But there was so much to do everywhere. 
With the societies and clubs, and the desire to 
take in all she could, to make all the advance 
possible, for she was proud of her standing, 
she sometimes grew quite weary, and the 
thought that this was her last year would in- 


 

trude. Never had girls seemed so charming 
to her, or the faculty so delightful. And it 
was hard to refuse joining different organiza- 
tions. 

“If you’ll only come in, we won't ask you 
to do much of anything,’ they pleaded. 

Out-of-doors was exhilarating. After all, 
few of the seniors stood on their dignity; in 
the games and sports they were not a day 
over sixteen. 

One of the juniors said, “ Why, I do not 
feel as old as when I was a freshman! And 
I was afraid I should be almost superannuated 
when I was through; twenty-two looked old 
to me. And now I think I shall be just in the 
most charming dawn of womanhood.” 

“ That is the way to look at it,” rejoined 
Professor Jordan, who stood among a bevy 
of girls. “ You are not to allow yourselves to 
get old. Think how many splendid women 
there are who are doing the world’s work and 
have passed the half-century. They have 
bright eyes, and eager, smiling faces, and 
are up-to-date in everything.” 

Miss Carol Saybrook had worked her way 




to the senior class and was considered a rather 
fascinating girl. She did dress elegantly, had 
a bright sort of wit, and a pathetic side that 
she allowed to crop out now and then, but 
drew it back again with the brief explanation 
that every one had trouble of some kind and 
did not want to be bored with that of other 
people. Her sigh would end with a beguiling 
smile. 

Her father had married a second time, and 
she was not on good terms with her step- 
mother. There were two younger children, 
“ and there may be a great houseful,” rather 
indignantly. “ Father is not a rich man, 
either, and if he should die we should all be 
beggars, I suppose.” 

She did not appear in any great straits now. 

Helen had experienced a rather curious in- 
terest in her, and of late they had taken some 
walks together, just by accident, it seemed. 

“ I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” 
Lorraine exclaimed complainingly, as she 
came up the walk only a few moments before 
dinner hour. “ I went to your room, Miss 
Morse’s, and the library, and out on the tennis 


 

court. They were having’ a fine game. And 
two days ago you disappeared mysteriously. 
If you were a soph, I should say you had been 
given a bad afternoon with a mountain of 
shortcomings.’ ’ 

“ I was walking.” 

“What sent you off alone?” 

Helen laughed, but just then the dinner bell 
pealed out its summons, and she ran. Lor- 
raine was the least bit jealous, not tiresomely 
so, and Leslie Brooks was very dear to her. 
She had also taken a great fancy to Miss 
Chardavoyne, but somehow she did not alto- 
gether like Miss Saybrook. She accepted 
Leslie's estimate of her. 

“ Leslie isn’t quite fair to her, I think,” 
Helen mused. “ She is curious, and though 
many of her epigrams are second-hand, they 
are always pat. And it must be hard to be 
crowded out of her father’s affection.” 

And not long after, Helen found herself 
straying off again with Miss Saybrook with- 
out the least design on her own part. 

“ I don't know just why you win one to a 
confidential mood," Miss Saybrook said. 




“ You are so different from the average girl. 
I do hope you will be very happy, Miss Grant, 
and yet I always fear for these large-hearted, 
generous, sympathetic girls. Commonplace 
people get more out of life, more out of their 
friends, and suffer less. You see, misfortunes 
never rest very heavily on them; they know 
how to shift them off on others. But when 
you keep sorrows to yourself — oh, I don't 
want to bore you — ” 

Her tone fell to pathos, her beautiful eyes 
were limpid and had the look of a hunted 
animal appealing for pity. They moved Helen 
in a sympathizing manner. 

“Oh, do not think of that! If you have 
any trouble — " Did she really want the con- 
fidence? How many other girls had it been 
given to, she wondered. 

“ I have a big question to decide. I'd like 
to know how it looks to some one with a little 
common sense. The ordinary girl is all for 
love, or the quality she thinks is love, and she 
scouts anything less in a marriage, but with 
a little experience she learns a great many 


 

things, and that one cannot live altogether 
on love.” 

“ No,” returned Helen seriously. She did 
not especially care about a dissertation on 
love. 

“No, you cannot live on love!” she said 
with a peculiar emphasis. “ It may be a defect 
in education,” with a touch of sarcasm. 
“ And I’m tired of being poor.” 

“ But it doesn’t seem to me that you are 
very poor.” 

“ Not up to this point, perhaps. Almost 
six years ago father married a young woman 
of twenty-three. He was just past forty. My 
mother left me some handsome jewels and a 
thousand dollars. My stepmother didn’t like 
me, wanted to get rid of me, in fact. Oh, 
there’s no love lost between us ! I said I 
would go to college, that would be all I would 
ask of him. Davenport is a wretched little 
place ; father has a big house, and hundreds 
of acres of land pretty well worn out, as 
Southern farms are. There is no society 
there. I like college life for the fun and vari- 
ety, the friends one makes. I’ve had a nice 



time every vacation, and my nice times, of 
course, end next summer. I should just hate 
to teach; I could not abide the confinement 
of office work, or waiting in a store.” 

She glanced up at Helen in an inquiring 
manner, as if testing her listener. 

“ I expect to teach,” Helen said with de- 
cision. Yet, she really could not imagine Miss 
Saybrook succeeding in that capacity. She 
was superficial; she would not get a diploma. 

“ Well — I just couldn’t, there now! I 
should want to shut myself in a room and turn 
on the gas. There’s no use in living unless 
you can have some of the things you want. 
I hate poverty and everything belonging to 
it. Father thinks he has done his duty by me; 
no doubt there’ll be a houseful of children to 
educate. He should have had more sense than 
to marry that way.” 

“ But what will you do? ” asked Helen with 
a puzzled air. She did not for an instant be- 
lieve Miss Saybrook would lay down life 
easily. 

“ I can marry. He is a rich New York 
man, a widower, with two married sons; no 


HELEN GRANT, SENIOR 

encumbrance, you see. He is sixty; I shall be 
twenty-two in the spring.” 

“ But do you — ” No, she would not tell 
the story that way if she cared for him es- 
pecially. Was he worthy of regard? 

Carol laughed with a hard sort of indif- 
ference. 

“ Oh, I’m not in love! Don’t be so much 
of a chicken as to ask me that! But I can 
have all the luxuries of life, journeys, clothes, 
jewels, society, pleasures. Isn’t it worth 
thinking about? ” 

Helen studied her. The eyes said, “ Oh, 
don’t judge me too hardly! ” and the girl ex- 
perienced a strange sort of pity for her. 

“ If you respect him,” she began slowly, 
“ if he has your confidence, your — oh, I don’t 
know what to say ! Think how old he is — 
almost forty years — ” 

“ Men at that time of life are partial to 
young wives. I am stylish, yes, good-look- 
ing,” smiling ironically. “He will get some 
one to be proud of. I don’t expect the ex- 
travagant love of a young man; that is mostly 
imagination. Oh, yes, I can see you are hor- 



rified! You are a sort of practical girl, too; 
not one of the high-flown sort, full of roman- 
tic ideas. But think what it would be to me 
to be set adrift in the world, or to grow old 
in that dead and half-alive sort of place, and 
bicker continually with a grasping young step- 
mother, grudging every penny for her own 
children. You have so many real friends. 
Some one said a young woman who adored 
you was an immense heiress and had a splen- 
did home of her own. If I had a place like 
that to go to, or a friend like that to tide me 
over these shoals and quicksands! Oh, say 
you pity me a little! ” in an imploring tone. 
“ I’m not much given to asking sympathy.” 

“ I do feel very, very sorry for you,” Helen 
replied sincerely. “ Of course, I have always 
known I must depend upon myself — ” 

“ But you see I wasn’t brought up in this 
resolute, practical, utilitarian sort of way. I 
couldn’t fight through, as these self-made 
women do; I really couldn’t. I’d rather 
marry some rich young man, but he doesn’t 
seem to materialize. Oh, I don’t know why 
I told you all this! No one can help me to 


 

decide. Only, when you see me taking part 
in all the holiday plans and pleasures, almost 
as if I was feather-brained, you will know I 
have a heart that can ache. I won’t ask your 
good opinion ; only a little kindly charity. 
Ugh ! how that wind blows. Let us race up 
to the hall; I'm chilled through.” 

She grasped Helen’s hand and they flew 
along together. 

“I like you very, very much!” she ex- 
claimed in a tone that was both ardent and 
impressive. 

They were rehearsing for a little comedy 
that evening, and Miss Saybrook was gay and 
eager, taking her part to perfection. 

“ Carol Saybrook would make a splendid 
actress,” said some one. “ I should think the 
life would tempt her.” 

“ The money and the honors might if she 
was sure of winning them. But it isn’t such 
an easy matter, if one sets out to reach the 
high places,” was the rejoinder. 

And now Christmas plans came on apace. 
Who was to go home, or elsewhere; who was 
to stay, lonely and forlorn? 


“ I am, for one,’ declared Leslie Brooks. 
“ My sister-in-law wants to keep the feast 
with her own family, which is right enough. 
And there is a good deal of work I would 
like to do.” 

Helen was undecided. Mrs. Bell wrote 
from Vernon Park that they were all well 
and happy, and that Marjorie had a little 
daughter. They hoped she might spend a few 
days with them. 

“ Girls,” said Miss Morse, as several were 
passing the evening in her room, “ I have a 
plan to propose. All of Mrs. Carter’s girls are 
going away. I'd like for once to see how it 
would seem to be a real householder. How 
many of you will visit me for a week? And 
have you any friends you could invite? That 
pretty, winsome, little Chardavoyne girl is 
not going anywhere; home is too far. I’ve 
taken quite a fancy to her. She will never 
make a great scholar, but I do think she has 
the gift of poesy. So I have asked her and 
she is just delighted; and now, Helen, I am 
going to ask you, and beg you to invite your 
friend, Miss Craven,” 



“ Will I have to beg entrance to this 
charmed circle ?” inquired Leslie, with a 
dainty air of deprecation that settled into an 
amused smile. 

“ I was coming round to you. And Lor- 
raine Denman, Margaret Van Duyne — that 
makes six — and if you have any choice 
friends, I think I should like one or two more. 
And my brother will come for a few days. I 
will give you all permission to invite any gen- 
tleman friends to dinners, or make little recep- 
tions for them.” 

“ Why, I think it is just delightful!”. 

“ Christmas falls on Sunday. Friday, 
everything will be cleared up, but we will 
begin on Monday and take the whole week 
and put in it all the pleasure we can. My 
brother will likely be along by Tuesday; 
church work will be over then.” 

“ And Miss Craven will hardly be able to 
get away sooner. She will have her little 
girls to look after.” 

“ Miss Van Duyne is to ask a cousin, a 
young West Point graduate who is to go off 
somewhere about the middle of next month. 



I’m not going to be a very severe chaperone, 
because I can depend upon you all. But it 
is to be a little bit of home-making, and you 
must all bring your share.” 

“Why, it will be just enchanting!” de- 
clared Leslie. “ Miss Morse, you ought to be 
the real mother of a family of girls.” 

“ Yes,” Miss Morse responded, with a 
funny twinkle that seemed to spread from her 
eyes to the lines about her mouth. “ I’ve had 
serious thoughts of marrying some widower 
with about five girls. I should want them 
to be intelligent, healthy, comparatively good- 
tempered, and each one to have some especial 
grace or gift. And with all my efforts, I 
haven’t been able to find just the right sort of 
widower, or the girls.” 

They all laughed heartily. “ Oh, Miss 
Morse!” cried Lorraine, “ I'm quite sure 
there would be one disagreeable girl among 
them,” 

Shirley caught the professor’s hand. 

“ I’d even be the disagreeable girl,” she 
said in a soft, wistful tone, “ because you 


 

could train me, and it would be a delight to 
please you.” 

“Thank you;” Miss Morse returned the 
pressure. 

So they settled it with Mrs. Carter, and 
those who had friends to invite wrote to them. 
The classes planned for Christmas eve a great 
procession with those that remained. It had 
to be on Saturday evening. There was to be 
a Santa Claus, a small wagon of presents 
drawn by four girls all wrapped in furs, a 
band with all sorts of improvised music, from 
horns to combs and mouth organs. 

Saturday morning, Helen was alone in the 
room, when Miss Saybrook entered, glancing 
around furtively. She had a wild, entreating 
look and had been crying, but Helen was 
struck with the beauty of her face in tears. 
How many different expressions it could 
wear ! 

“Oh, what is it?” she inquired apprehen- 
sively. 

“ Oh, my dear Miss Grant, I have come to 
throw myself upon your mercy! I am in 
bitter, bitter trouble! I sometimes feel as if it 



would be a relief to go out of the world. I 
can’t face disgrace, and if I can’t find a little 
help, it will be that. The friend on whom I 
thought I could rely went away yesterday 
noon. It is dreadful! ” and she dabbed her 
cheeks with her dainty, lace handkerchief. 

“But what is it?” Helen was deeply 
moved by the apparent anguish that she could 
not suspect was assumed. 

“ It's horrid ! I suppose I ought to go to 
prison for it. You see ” — her voice trembled 
with emotion, and her color came and went — 
“ father sent the last of the money for the 
term, and I was owing something that a man 
threatened to sue for, and just on the impulse 
of the moment I paid it with that money. 
Father won’t send again until the beginning 
of the term, and I’ve been notified — the sec- 
ond time. You know what that means! And 
in a week or ten days I shall have the money 
from some other source. But just now — ” 
and her voice ended with a rush of sobs she 
had been holding back, as she buried her face 
in Helen’s new poppy cushion. 

Helen guessed, but did not speak. She was 


 

thinking of the beautiful, new, tailored suit, 
in a deep maroon broadcloth, fur-trimmed, 
that came a month ago, in which Miss Say- 
brook looked superb, and the elegant silver- 
gray, new in October. 

“ You see, if I could have a hundred dollars 
for ten or twelve days, I should be all right. 
Can’t you, oh, won’t you, lend me that? It’s 
only such a little while. I can’t face the — 
the disgrace ! Oh ! I should not have done it, 
but I was so frightened when the man threat- 
ened to sue — ” 

“ I haven’t a hundred dollars by me,” Helen 
said slowly. She felt sorry for her against 
her better judgment. To be disgraced just 
for ten days! 

“ You see, when I come back I shall have 
the money. I have a very good friend who 
can get it out of father in time. He promised 
to see me through college, and all those years 
I was his only idolized child. It’s cruel ! He 
wouldn't act so but for that selfish thing in my 
mother’s place ! ” 

“Must it be a hundred?” Helen inquired. 


“ That is due the college. Perhaps I could 
beg off part — ” 

“ I might get it for you — ” hesitatingly. 

“ Oh, if you could or would! ” imploringly. 

Girls had been used to borrowing small 
sums, and Helen had lent out quarters and 
half-dollars that had not been returned. This 
was different, and a flood of remembrances 
rushed over Helen, talks on kindliness, help- 
fulness, the aim of the larger life that thought 
no evil, that diffused a finer and sweeter at- 
mosphere, that taught them to truly love one 
another, for even the publicans could be good 
to their own. In her moment of exaltation, 
such as heroic girls have, she said : 

“ Yes, I will do it for you.” 

“Oh, you are an angel!” Miss Saybrook 
sprang up and clasped her arms about Helen, 
laid her wet cheek against that of the other. 
“ Giving the money back will not repay you, 
and you can never wholly realize my grati- 
tude, for you have not been in such awful 
straits. It’s just salvation for me.” 

“ When did you want to go? ” Helen was 
afraid she was beginning to repent, and she 


 

crowded down the misgiving as being un- 
charitable. 

“ The stage will be here at one. I shall 
have to take my trunk, and that’s a nuisance, 
too.” 

Helen went to her drawer. There was 
seventy dollars. She had not quite finished 
her Christmas buying; she could get a little 
from Leslie or Lorraine. 

“ There is seventy,” she said. “ I will give 
you the remaining thirty — ” 

“ Just after lunch, when I say good-by to
