 



CHAPTER XV. 



IN "WHICH BOBBY GETS INTO A SCRAPE, AND TOM 
SPICER TURNS UP AGAIN. 

BOBBY had a poorer opinion of human nature than 
ever before. It seemed almost incredible to him that 
words so fairly spoken as those of Tom Spicer could 
be false. He had just risen from a sick bed, where 
he had had an opportunity for long and serious reflec- 
tion. Tom had promised fairly, and Bobby had every 
reason to suppose he intended to be a good boy. 
But his promises had been lies. He had never in- 
tended to reform, at least not since he had got off 
his bed of pain. He was mortified and disheartened 
at the failure of this attempt to restore him to him- 
self. 

Like a great many older and wiser persons than 
himself, he was prone to judge the whole human 
family by a single individual. He did not come to 



believe that every man was a rascal, but, in more gen- 
eral terms, that there is a great deal more rascality 
in this world than one would be willing to believe. 

With this sage reflection, he dismissed Tom from 
his mind, which very naturally turned again to the 
air castle which had been so ruthlessly upset. Then 
his opinion of "the rest of mankind" was reversed ; 
and he reflected that if the world were only peopled 
by angels like Annie Lee, what a pleasant place it 
would be to live in. She could not tell a lie, she 
could not use bad language, she could not steal, or 
do any thing else that was bad ; and the prospect 
was decidedly pleasant. It was very agreeable to 
turn from Tom to Annie, and in a moment his air 
castle was built again, and throned on clouds of gold 
and purple. I do not know what impossible things 
he imagined, or how far up in the clouds he would 
have gone, if the arrival of the train at the city had 
not interrupted his thoughts, and pitched him down 
upon the earth again. 

Bobby was not one of that impracticable class of 
persons who do nothing but dream ; for he felt that 
he had a mission to perform which dreaming could 



 

not accomplish. However pleasant it may be to 
think of the great and brilliant things which one trill 
do, to one of Bobby's practical character it was even 
more pleasant to perform them. TVe all dream great 
things, imagine great things ; but he who stops there 
does not amount to much, and the world can well 
spars him, for he is nothing but a drone in the hive. 
Bobby's fine imaginings were pretty sure to bring out 
a " now or never," which was the pledge of action, 
and the work was as good as done when he had 
said it. 

Therefore, when the train arrived, Bobby did not 
stop to dream any longer. He forgot his beautiful 
air castle, and even let Annie Lee slip from his mind 
for the time being. Those towns upon the Kennebec, 
the two hundred books he was to sell, loomed up be- 
fore him, for it was with them he had to do. 

Grasping the little valise he carried with him, he 
was hastening out of the station house when a hand 
was placed upon his shoulder. 

" Got off slick didn't I ? " said Tom Spicer, pla- 
cing himself by Bobby's side. 

" You here, Tom ! ' exclaimed our hero, gazing 
with astonishment at his late companion. 



 

It was not an agreeable encounter, and from the 
bottom of his heart Bobby wished him any where but 
where he was. He foresaw that he could not easily 
get rid of him. 

" I am here," replied Tom. " I ran through the 
woods to the depot, and got aboard the cars just as 
they were starting. The old man couldn't come it 
over me quite so slick as that." 

"But you ran away from home." 

Well, what of it ? " 

"A good deal, I should say." 

" If you had been in my place, you would havp 
done the same." 

" I don't know about that ; obedience to parents 
is one of our first duties." 

" I know that ; and if I had had any sort of fair 
play, I wouldn't have run away." 

" What do you mean by that ? ' asked Bobby, 
somewhat surprised, though he had a faint idea of the 
meaning of the other. 

" I will tell you all about it by and by. I give 
you my word andionor that I will make every thing 
satisfactory to you." 



 



." 



" But you lied to me on the road this morning.' 

Tom winced ; under ordinary circumstances he 
would have resented such a remark by " clearing 
away " for a fight. But he had a purpose to accom- 
plish, and he knew the character of him with whom 
he had to deal. 

" I am sorry I did, now," answered Tom, with 
every manifestation of penitence for his fault. " I 
didn't want to lie to you ; and it went against my 
conscience to do so. But I was afraid, if I told you 
my father refused, up and down, to let me go, that 
you wouldn't be willing I should come with you." 

" I shall not be any more willing now I know all 
about it," added Bobby, in an uncompromising tone. 

" Wait till you have heard my story, and then you 
won't blame me." 

" Of course you can go where you please ; it is 
none of my business ; but let me tell you, Tom, in 
the beginning, that I won't go with a fellow who has 
run away from his father and mother." 

" Pooh ! What's the use of talking in that way ? " 

Tom was evidently disconcerted by this decided 
stand of his companion. He knew that his bump of 




firmness was well developed, and whatever he said 
he meant. 

" You had better return home, Tom. Boys that 
run away from home don't often amount to much. 
Take my advice, and go home," added Bobby. 

" To such a home as mine ! " said Tom, gloomily. 
" If I had such a home as yours, I would not have 
left it." 

Bobby got a further idea from this remark of the 
true state of the case, and the consideration moved 
him. Tom's father was a notoriously intemperate 
man, and the boy had nothing to hope for from his 
precept or his example. He was the child of a 
drunkard, and as much to be pitied as blamed for his 
vices. His home was not pleasant. He who presided
over it, and who should have made a paradise 
of it, was its evil genius, a demon of wiekedness, who 
blasted its flowers as fast as they bloomed. 

Tom had seemed truly penitent both during his 
illness and since his recovery. His one great desire 
now was to get away from home, for home to him 
was a place of torment. Bobby suspected all this, 
and in his great heart he pitied his companion. He 
did not know what to do. 



 



.- 



I am sorry for you, Tom," said he, after he had 
considered the matter in this new light; "but I 
don't see what I can do for you. I doubt whether it 
would be right for me to help you run away from 
your parents." 

" I don't want you to help me run away. I have 
done that already." 

" But, if I let you go with me, it will be just 
the same thing. Besides, since you told me those 
lies this morning, I haven't much confidence in 
you." 

" I couldn't help that." 

" Yes, you could. Couldn't help lying ? ' : 

" What could I do ? You would have gone right 
back and told my father." 

" Well, we will go up to Mr. Bayard's store, and 
then we will see what can be done." 

" I couldn't stay at home, sure," continued Tom, 
as they walked along together. " My father even 
talked of binding me out to a trade." 

" Did he ? " 

Bobby stopped short in the street ; for it was evi- 
dent that, as this would remove him from his unhappy 





 

home, and thus effect all he professed to desire, he 
had some other purpose in view. 

" What are you stopping for, Bob ? " 

" I think you better go back, Tom." 

" Not I ; I won't do that, whatever happens." 

" If your father will put you to a trade, what more 
do you want ? ' 

" I won't go to a trade, any how." 

Bobby said no more, but determined to consult 
with Mr. Bayard about the matter ; and Tom was 
soon too busily engaged in observing the strange 
sights and sounds of the city to think of any thing 
else. 

When they reached the store, Bobby went into 
Mr. Bayard's private office and told him all about the 
affair. The bookseller decided that Tom had run 
away more to avoid being bound to a trade than be- 
cause his home was unpleasant ; and this decision 
seemed to Bobby all the more just because he knew 
that Tom's mother, though a drunkard's wife, was a 
very good woman. Mr. Bayard further decided that 
Bobby ought not to permit the runaway to be the 
companion of his journey. He also considered it his 



 

duty to write to Mr. Spicer, informing him of his son's 
arrival in the city, and clearing Bobby from any agen- 
cy in his escape. 

While Mr. Bayard was writing the letter, Bobby 
went out to give Tom the result of the consultation. 
The runaway received it with a great show of 'emo- 
tion, and begged and pleaded to have the decision 
reversed. But Bobby, though he would gladly have 
done any thing for him which was consistent with his 
duty, was firm as a rock, and positively refused to 
have any thing to do with him until he obtained his 
father's consent ; or, if there was any such trouble as 
he asserted, his mother's consent. 

Tom left the store, apparently " more in sorrow 
than in anger." His bullying nature seemed to be 
cast out, and Bobby could not but feel sorry for him. 
Duty was imperative, as it always is, and it must be 
done " now or never." 

During the day the little merchant attended to the 
packing of his stock, and to such other preparations as 
were required for his journey. He must take the 
steamer that evening for Bath, and when the time for 
his departure arrived, he was attended to the wharf 


 

by Mr. Bayard and Ellen, with whom he had passed 
the afternoon. The bookseller assisted him in pro- 
curing his ticket and berth, and gave him such in- 
structions as his inexperience demanded. 

The last bell rang, the fasts were cast off, and the 
great wheels of the steamer began to turn. Our hero, 
who had never been on the water in a steamboat, or 
indeed any thing bigger than a punt on the river at 
home, was much interested and excited by his novel 
position. He seated himself on the promenade deck, 
and watched with wonder the boiling, surging waters 
astern of the steamer. 

How powerful is man, the author of that mighty 
machine that bore him so swiftly over the deep blue 
waters ! Bobby was a little philosopher, as we have 
before had occasion to remark, and he was decidedly 
of the opinion that the steamboat was a great institu- 
tion. When he had in some measure conquered his 
amazement, and the first ideas of sublimity which the 
steamer and the sea were calculated to excite in a 
poetical imagination, he walked forward to take a 
closer survey of the machinery. After all, there was 
something rather comical in the affair. The steam 




hissed and sputtered, and the great walking beam 
kept flying up and down ; and the sum total of Bob- 
by's philosophy was, that it was fanny these things 
should make the boat go so like a race horse over the 
water. 

Then he took a look into the pilot house, and it 
seemed more funny that turning that big wheel should 
steer the boat. But the wind blew rather fresh at 
the forward part of the boat, and as Bobby's philoso- 
phy was not proof against it, he returned to the 
promenade deck, which was sheltered from the sever- 
ity of the blast. He had got reconciled to the whole 
thing, and ceased to bother his head about the big 
wheel, the sputtering steam, and the walking beam ; 
so he seated himself, and began to wonder what all 
the people in Riverdale were about. 

" All them as hasn't paid their fare, please walk up 
to the cap'n's office and s-e-t-t-l-e ! ' shouted a col- 
ored boy, presenting himself just then, and furiously 
ringing a large hand bell. 



I have just settled," said Bobby, alluding to his 
comfortable seat. 

But the allusion was so indefinite to the colored 




boy that he thought himself insulted. He did not 
appear to be a very amiable boy, for his fist was 
doubled up, and with sundry big oaths, he threatened 
to annihilate the little merchant for his insolence. 

" I didn't say any thing that need offend you," re- 
plied Bobby. " I meant nothing." 

" You lie ! You did ! " 

He was on the point of administering a blow with 
his fist, when a third party appeared on the ground, 
and without waiting to hear the merits of the case, 
struck the negro a blow which had nearly floored 
him. 

Some of the passengers now interfered, and the 
colored boy was prevented from executing vengeance 
on the assailant. 

" Strike that fellow and you strike me ! " said he 
who had struck the blow. 

" Tom Spicer ! ' exclaimed Bobby, astonished and 
chagrined at the presence of the runaway. 






CHAPTER XVI. 



IN WHICH BOBBY FINDS 4 IT IS AN ILL WIND 
THAT BLOWS NO ONE ANY GOOD." 



A GENTLEMAN, who was sitting near Bobby when 
he made the remark which the colored boy had mis- 
understood, interfered to free him from blame, and 
probably all unpleasant feelings might have been 
saved, if Tom's zeal had been properly directed. As 
it was, the waiter retired with his bell, vowing ven- 
geance upon his assailant. 

" How came you here, Tom ? " asked Bobby, when 
the excitement had subsided. 

" You don't get rid of me so easily," replied Tom, 
laughing.' 

Bobby called to mind the old adage that " a bad 
penny is sure to return ; " and, if it had not been a 
very uncivil remark, he would have said it. 

" I didn't expect to see you again at present," he 
observed, hardly knowing what to say or do. 



" I suppose not ; but as I didn't mean you should 
expect me, I kept out of sight. Only for that darkey, 
you wouldn't have found me out so soon. I like you, 
Bob, in spite of all you have done to get rid of me, 
and I wasn't a going to let the darkey thrash you." 
You only made matters worse." 
That is all the thanks I get for hitting him for 
you." 

" I am sorry you hit him ; at the same time I sup- 
pose you meant to do me a service, and I thank you, 
not for the blow you struck the black boy, but for 
your good intentions." 

" That sounds better. I meant well, Bob." 
" I dare say you did. But how came you here ? ' 
" Why, you see, I was bound to go with you any 
how, or at least to keep within hail of you. You 
told me, you know, that you were going in the steam- 
boat ; and after I left the shop, what should I see 
but a big picture of a steamboat on a wall. It 
said ' Bath, Gardiner, and Hallowell,' on the bill ; and 
I knew that was where you meant to go. So this 
afternoon I hunts round and finds the steamboat. I 
thought I never should have found it ; but here I am." 



 



" What are you going to do ? ' 

" Going into the book business," replied Tom, with 
a smile. 

" Where are your books ? ' 

" Down stairs, in the cellar of the steamboat, or 
whatever you call it." 

" Where did you get them ? ' 

" Bought 'em, of course." 

"Did you? Where?" 

"Well, I don't remember the name of the street 
now. I could go right there if I was in the city, 
though." 

" Would they trust you ? ' 

Tom hesitated. The lies he had told that morning 
had done him no good had rather injured his cause ; 
and, though he had no principle that forbade lying, 
he questioned its policy in the present instance. 

" I paid part down, and they trusted me part." 

" How many books you got? ' 

" Twenty dollars worth. I paid eight dollars 
down." 

"You did ? Where did you get the eight dol- 
lars?" 



 

Bobby remembered the money Tom's father had 
lost several weeks before, and immediately connected 



that circumstance with his present ability to pay so 
large a sum. 

Tom hesitated again, but he was never at a loss for 
an answer. 

" My mother gave it to me." 

"Your mother? ' 

" Yes, sir ," replied Tom, boldly, and in that pe- 
culiarly bluff manner which is almost always good 
evidence that the boy is lying. 

" But YOU ran away from home.' 



" That's so ; but my mother knew I was coming." 

"Did she?" 

" To be sure she did." 

" You didn't say so before." 

" I can't tell all I know in a minute." 

" If I thought your mother consented to your com- 
ing, I wouldn't say another word." 

" Well, she did ; you may bet your life on that." 

" And your mother gave you ten dollars ? ' : 

" Who said she gave me ten dollars ? " asked Tom, 
a little sharply. 



 

That was just the sum his father had lost, and 
Bobby had unwittingly hinted his suspicion. 

" You must have had as much as that if you paid 
eight on your books. Your fare to Boston and your 
steamboat fare must be two dollars more." 

" I know that ; but look here, Bob ; ' and Tom 



took from his pocket five half dollars and exhibited 
them to his companion. u She gave me thirteen 
dollars." 

Notwithstanding this argument, Bobby felt almost 
sure that the lost ten dollars was a part of his capital. 

" I will tell you my story now, Bob, if you like. 
You condemned me without a hearing, as Jim Guthrie 
said when they sent him to the House of Correction 
for getting drunk." 

" Go ahead." 

The substance of Tom's story was, that his father 
drank so hard, and was such a tyrant in the house, 
that he could endure it no longer. His father and 
mother did not agree, as any one might have sus- 
pected. His mother, encouraged by the success of 
Bobby, thought that Tom might do something of thv 
kind, and she had provided him the money to buy his 
stock of books. 



Bobby had not much confidence in this story. He 
had been deceived once ; besides, it was not con- 
sistent with his previous narrative, and he had not be- 
fore hinted that he had obtained his mother's consent. 
But Tom was eloquent, and protested that he had 
reformed, and meant to do well. He declared, by all 
that was good and great, Bobby should never have 
reason to be ashamed of him. 

Our little merchant was troubled. He could not 
now get rid of Tom without actually quarrelling with 
him, or running away from him. He did not wish to 
do the former, and it was not an easy matter to do 
the latter. Besides, there was hope that the runaway 
would do well; and if he did, when he carried the 
profits of his trade home, his father would forgive 
him. One thing was certain; if he returned to 
Riverdale he would be what he had been before. 

For these reasons Bobby finally, but very reluc- 
tantly, consented that Tom should remain with him, 
resolving, however, that, if he did not behave himself, 
he would leave him at once. 

Before morning he had another reason. When the 
steamer got out into the open bay, Bobby was sea- 



 

sick. He retired to his berth with a dreadful head- 
ache ; as he described it afterwards, it seemed just as 
though that great walking beam was smashing up 
and down right in the midst of his brains. He had 
never felt so ill before in his life, and was very sure, 
in his inexperience, that something worse than mere 
seasickness ailed him. 

He told Tom, who was not in the least affected, 
how he felt ; whereupon the runaway blustered 
round, got the steward and the captain into the 
cabin, and was very sure that Bobby would die be- 
fore morning, if we may judge by the fuss he made. 

The captain was angry at being called from the 
pilot house for nothing, and threatened to throw Tom 
overboard if he didn't stop his noise. The steward, 
however, was a kind-hearted man, and assured Bobby 
that passengers were often a great deal sicker than 
he was ; but he promised to do something for his re- 
lief, and Tom went with him to his state room for 
the desired remedy. 

The potion was nothing more nor less than a 
table spoonful of brandy, which Bobby, who had 
conscientious scruples about drinking ardent spa-its, 


at first refused to take. Then Tom argued the 
point, and the sick boy yielded. The dose made 
him sicker yet, and nature came to his relief, and in 
a little while he felt better. 

Tom behaved like a good nurse ; he staid by his 
friend till he went to sleep, and then " turned in " 
upon a settee beneath his berth. The boat pitched 
and tumbled about so in the heavy sea that Bobby 
did not sleep long, and when he woke he found Tom 
ready to assist him. But our hero felt better, and 
entreated Tom to go to sleep again. He made the 
best of his unpleasant situation. Sleep was not to 
be wooed, and he tried to pass away the dreary hours 
in thinking of Biverdale and,- the dear ones there. 
His mother was asleep, and Annie was asleep ; and 
that was about all the excitement he could get up 
even on the home question. He could not build 
castles in the air, fqr seasickness and castle building 
do not agree. The gold and purple clouds would be 
black in spite of him, and the aerial structure he es- 
sayed to build would pitch and tumble about, for all 
the world, just like a steamboat in a heavy sea. As 
often as he got fairly into it, he was violently rolled 



 

out, and in a twinkling found himself in his narrow 
berth, awfully seasick. 

He went to sleep again at last, and the long night 
passed away. When he woke in the morning, he felt 
tolerably well, and was thankful that he had got out 
of that scrape. But before he could dress himself, he 
heard a terrible racket on deck. The steam whistle 
was shrieking, the bell was banging, and he heard 
the hoarse bellowing of the captain. It was certain 
that something had happened, or was about to hap- 
pen. 

Then the boat stopped, rolling heavily in the sea. 
Tom was not there ; he had gone on deck. Bobby 
was beginning to consider what a dreadful thing a 
wreck was, when Tom appeared.
