shut up together for an hour and a half: nobody 
could get in ; nobody knew what was going on. 
At the end of the hour and a half Tom came out 
with a terrible frown on his handsome forehead, 
a look very unlike Tom about his mouth. He 
went directly to his room, shut his door hard, 
and locked it. He did not come down till 
dinner-time, and Gypsy did not dare to go to 
him. About the middle of the afternoon she 
went up and knocked. He did not hear, so 
she pushed open the door softly and went 
in. He was sitting by his table, with his 
books open before him, — the Greek and the 
Euclid, and, Gypsy had time to see before 
she spoke, the mysterious blue book which 
he had taken out of her sight so roughly the 
night before. 



“Why, Tom, what are you doing?” 

“ Cramming.” 

“ Cramming? ” 

“ Studying, then ; shut the door, if you ’re 
going to talk about it.” 

Gypsy shut the door, and came up and stood 
beside him. 

“ Studying in vacation? Why, I don’t 
understand.” 

“ I don’t suppose you do, and I wish you 
needn’t. I ’m conditioned, that’s all.” 

“ Conditioned ! ” Gypsy sat down slowly, 
looking at him. Tom took out his knife and 
began to whittle the table in dogged silence. 

“ That means — why, it means you didn’t 
get your lessons, and they — ” 

“ It means I fell below average, and I ’ve 
got to make it up. There ! you have it now,” 
said Tom, bringing his hand down heavily on 
the table. 

“ Oh, Tom,” said Gypsy, “ I am so sorry ! ” 
And that was every word she said, and the very 
best thing she could have said. Tom winked. 



and coughed, and turned over the leaves of his 
book, and threw it down sharply. 

“That’s the worst of it. I suppose I might 
have made you and mother proud of me. The 
tutors were rough on me, all through, every 
one, just because they said I might head the 
division if I chose to ; I should like to know 
how they knew ! ” 

“ Of course they knew ; everybody knows,” 
said Gypsy, sadly. “ And I thought — we all 
thought — ” She stopped, fearing that what 
she was going to say would sound like a taunt. 
Tom’s handsome face flushed. 

“ I know what you all thought. And if ever 
a fellow meant to behave and get a rank, I did. 
But you see there ’s always so much fun going 
on at college, and father doesn’t make the least 
account of that. He ’s given me a terrible 
blowing this morning.” 

“ I was afraid so. About the rank? ” 

“Yes; that’s all he knows to talk about yet. 
He’ll hunt up something else before long.” 

“ Tom ! ” 



“Well, he does put me out so, Gypsy. I 
suppose I deserve a little of it, but he has such 
a way of hacking at you. It’s Tom this, Tom- 
that, Tom the other, forever reminding you that 
you ’ve been acting like a fool. He knocks out 
all the sorry there is in me.” 

Gypsy sat in silence, not wishing to say any- 
thing disrespectful of her father, not daring or 
wishing to throw all the blame on Tom. Pres- 
ently, thinking that she was in his way, she rose 
to go out of the room. Tom called her back. 

“ See here, Gypsy, you ’ve seen this pony of 
course, and I don’t know that I ’m sorry. I hid 
it away from you last night, and felt cheap 
enough. I suppose you ’ll think I ’m a horrible 
sinner, but I can’t bear to cheat about it.” 

“Pony?” said Gypsy, bewildered, looking 
round with some vague ideas of finding a 
rocking-horse, or some stuffed zoological speci- 
men. 

“ Here, this.” Tom took up the blue book, 
and Gypsy saw that it was a translation of 
Homer. She looked up with a shocked, recoiling
look that Tom had never seen in his sister’s 
eyes before, and that he did not very soon 
forget. 

“ Tom, how can you ? ” 

Tom’s honest eyes quailed, looked doubtful, 
brightened again 

“ Gypsy, it isn’t half as bad as you think. 
I only use it in the worst places, after I ’ve made 
my own translation. All the fellows do that, 
and the Faculty know it as well as we do. I 
don’t use it as some fellows do, — learn all my 
lesson by it ; I wouldn’t be mean enough.” 

“But why use it at all?” said Gypsy, doubt- 
fully, yet half relieved. 

“ Then I shouldn’t stand on an equal footing 
with the rest, to start with ; it ’s a perfectly 
understood thing. Why, one time one of the 
tutors talked with the class about it. To use 
it as I use it is no cheat ; I ’ve not quite come to 
that!' 

“ Then why did you hide it away and keep 
it secret? I don’t see exactly.” 

“Just for the reason I hide away so many 



things,” said Tom, half under his breath, — 
“ father. He would make a terrible row.” 

Gypsy did not say anything. 

“ A fellow doesn’t like to be looked at with 
such eyes as you had a minute ago,” said Tom, 
moving uneasily in his chair. “ If you won’t 
believe I use it in honest ways, here, — to show 
you how little I care for it, — take the thing 
and lock it up in your drawer, and I ’ll come to 
you when I 'want it.” 

It is not my purpose to enter into a discussion 
of the minor moralities of “ ponying ” here, 
or to decide whether or not Tom’s view of the 
matter, which is by no means an unusual one, 
was correct. Gypsy did not ; she followed her 
instinct: she kissed Tom, seized the book, and 
ran away to her owm room, feeling very thankful, 
and wondering what her eyes had to do with it. 

Into the dark outline Gypsy had scattered one 
little seed, perhaps. If she sowed her shadow 
full of such, it might prove to be no shadow at 
all, but a spot of bloom flashing white and 
golden in the light. 



room window, which she had opened to let a 
breath of the fresh, sparkling air into the heated 
room. She was very busy with her work, 
which was of a sort unusual for a girl. She 
was neither crocheting, nor netting, nor knitting 
tidies, nor stringing beads, nor darning stockings,
— though I cannot say that there were 
not an abundance up in her bureau drawers in 
sad need of darning; — she was making a ball. 
Neither was it one of the soft, pudding-like 


affairs commonly and contemptuously styled 
“ girls’ balls ; ” it was wound on a bullet, with 
the finest, strongest twine, and almost as tightly 
drawn as if her firm pink fingers had been 
twice as large and brown as they were. She 
was now sewing on the leather cover with stout 
waxed twine and an enormous needle, her face 
flushed and her fingers aching. Tom was the 
object of this, as he was now of almost everything 
that she did. Tom liked to pass ball with 
her, and it kept him at home. 

Suddenly she started a little, and dropped her 
work, — needles, thread, ball, and all. It was 
only a sound that she had heard, but it sent the 
hot blood flushing over her face, and her eyes 
grew dark and troubled. It was the sound of 
voices, — two ; of voices in loud and angry 
discussion. She could not see the speakers, but 
they seemed to be approaching the house behind 
the wood-pile : to avoid hearing what they said 
was impossible. 

“ I should like to know how long this has 
been going on.” 



There was no answer. 

“ I should like to know how long this has 
been going on, Tom.” 

“ I don’t know, sir, and I don’t see that it is 
anything so dreadful, if it had been going on 
all the term ; there aren’t fifteen fellows in the 
class that don’t do it.” 

“What other men do is no concern of yours. 
It is a filthy habit, and I never thought a son 
of mine would come to it. Besides, it will ruin 
your health. How much more of the stuff have 
you ? ” 

“ A few of Hall’s Havanas, and some I bought 
myself.” 

“ Well, sir, you will throw them away to- 
day. I can’t have it.” 

“ I don’t think it is a case in which you 
ought to give me any commands father. I ’m 
too old to be treated so.” 

“ I can’t help it, my son ; I can’t help it. 
If you ’re young enough to do such things, 
you ’re young enough to be commanded. You 
don’t know how you have troubled and disappointed me. 
I lay awake all last night worry- 
ing about you, and — ” 

“ Why couldn’t you trust me a little then, 
father, and say you didn’t like it, and then leave 
the matter to me? Mother and Gypsy go at 
me different ways. I might have given it up for 
them!' Just there the voices stopped, and the 
speakers came in sight around the wood-pile ; 
Tom flushed and angry, his father with a troubled, 
helpless face. 

Mrs. Breynton, too, had heard, it seemed, 
for she came into the entry, and met them at the 
door. She said nothing, but her eyes asked 
what was the matter. 

“ I found him out behind the wood-pile, 
smoking, and that’s what’s the matter!” said 
his father, excitedly. 

“ Mr. Simms sent over a message from the 
store just now for you,” said Mrs. Breynton, in 
her quiet way. “ Can’t we talk about this at 
some other time? He said you were wanted 
very much, — something about the new hydraulic 
press, I believe.” 


“ Oh, I wonder if it has come ! Well, I must 
go right over. Tom, you can tell the story to 
your mother yourself.” 

But she did not ask for it. She let him slip 
away to his room unobserved ; he would be 
better/ alone till that flash was out of his eye. 
Tom’s mother always comprehended him. 

Gypsy was a little like her, for she too left 
Tom to himself, determined not to say anything 
about what had happened this morning, — if 
indeed she ever spoke of it, — until exactly the 
right time came. The right time came that very 
afternoon. 

She and Tom had been out together at York- 
bury’s fashionable hour, on Yorkbury’s fashion- 
able promenade, — down to the post office. 
Gypsy highly enjoyed — as what girl would 
not! — putting on her best hat and cherry 
ribbons, swinging her new cherry-lined muff by 
its tassels, and walking up and down among the 
girls and boys with Tom, to “ show him off.” 
A handsome brother fresh from college, with a 
fancy cane and a Sigma Epsilon pin, and a 


moustache, was a possession well worth having’. 
All the girls were sure to watch them, and inform 
her confidentially at recess the next day that 
they wished they had a brother just exactly like 
him. Such a delightful little sense of airy 
importance there was, too, in taking his arm, 
and trying to look as if she had been used to 
taking gentlemen’s arms these dozen years ! 

On this afternoon, after a little chatting and 
skirmishing and clustering around the office 
steps, and after Gypsy had listened to the 
communications of some half-dozen girls who all 
happened to have something singularly important 
to tell her, they fell in with Sarah Rowe and 
Francis, and the four walked home together. 
On the way, Francis took a cigar from his 
pocket, and lazily lighted it. 

“No offence to the ladies, I hope?” 

“ Dear, no ! ” cried Sarah. “ Why, I dote on 
cigar-smoke, — when it’s the real Havana, I 
mean, of course ; I think there ’s something so 
charming about it, don’t you, Gypsy?” 

“ No,” said Gypsy, bluntly. 



“Why, really,” said Mr. Francis, pausing with 
the cigar half-way to his lips, “ I didn’t know 
— I—” 

“ Oh, you needn’t stop on my account,” said 
Gypsy, coolly. “ Sarah asked what I thou glF, 
and I told her.” 

“Well, since you don’t care,” said Mr. Francis, 
and smoked all the way home. Gypsy was 
decidedly too young to waste his gallantry upon ; 
especially when such a stupendous sacrifice was 
involved. 

“ See here,” said Tom, after the Rowes had 
turned off to go home ; “ don’t you really like 
tobacco-smoke, Gypsy?” 

“ I particularly dislike it,” said Gypsy. 

“ Well, that ’s queer ! I thought all girls 
raved over it, like Sarah there. So you think, 
as father does, that it ’s wicked to smoke? ” 

“ Wicked ? no, indeed. But I think it’s horrid 

Gypsy’s “ horrid ” was untranslatable. Tom 
winced under it as he would never have done if 
she had undertaken to treat him to an anti-tobacco 
sermon. 


“ My dear, what a tone ! Anybody would 
think you were talking to a cannibal or a 
Mormon. Well, to be honest. Gyp, I wish 
there were a few other girls like you ; there 'd 
be less smoking. Most of them make their 
brothers cigar-cases and tobacco-bags, to say 
nothing of teasing for cigarettes themselves, — 
at least I ’ve heard that done more than once. 
I rather think you wouldn’t make me a tobacco- 
bag, now, if I asked you.” 

“ Ask me if you dare, sir ! ” 

“ Well, I shouldn’t dare. Now you see, 
Gypsy, I don’t think there ’s anything so hor- 
rible about smoking, nor disgusting, nor ungen- 
tlemanly, — that is, after you get used to it ; 
but I do wish father had a little more of your 
style. To tell the truth, I ’m not so fond of it 
but that I would have given it up for you or 
mother, if I were asked in a proper way ; but 
to be talked to as if I had committed the seven 
deadly sins, and then told I must n’t, on top of 
it, is more than a fellow can stand ! Now all the 
smoking I do has got to be done on the sly.” 


“ But you wouldn’t do that!' 

Gypsy said this with a little of the look that 
she had when she took the “ pony ” from him 
upstairs. 

Tom shrugged his shoulders and whistled. 

They walked on in silence a few minutes, he 
with his handsome face working and changing. 

“ Gypsy,” he said suddenly. 

“Well?” 

“ You ’re sort of taken down, — blue, — cut 
up, — about your revered and idolised brother’s 
collegiate course so far, — now own up.” 

“ Yes,” said Gypsy, “a little, Tom.” 

“ Well, to put it in black and white, so am 
I. I did mean, on my word and honour, to 
take a rank, and let the pomps and vanities 
alone. You don’t know the worst of me, 
either.” 

“The worst! Worse than this! Oh, Tom, 
what will father — ” 

Gypsy began so, but stopped, seeing that she 
had said the wrong thing. There was an awk- 
ward silence. 




“Gypsy,” said Tom, at length, “I wish you 
would write to a fellow oftener.” 

“Why?” 

“ Well, it ’s something from home, and you 
have more time than the rest. Besides, I tell 
you, Gypsy, you haven’t the least idea what 
sort of doings there are going on all round a 
chap when he ’s away from you, — not the least ; 
and I hope you never will. It is one thing to 
keep straight in Yorkbury, and another at Yale. 
And getting something from home, and being 
reminded that there ’s somebody who would be 
sorry, — well, every little helps. Pretty long 
breathing-spaces therev were between some of 
your letters last term ; you gave me plenty of 
time to forget you.” 

Gypsy’s cheeks burned for shame and sorrow, 
and then and there she made a certain promise 
to herself, which, I am glad to say, she never 
broke. 

A day or two after, she was out in the front 
yard snowballing with Tom, when Francis Rowe 
lounged up to the fence. 


“ Hilloa ! ” said Tom. 

“How are you?” nodded Francis; “here a 
minute.” 

Tom went, pursued by Gypsy’s well-aimed 
balls. 

“ I have something to tell you,” said Francis, 
mysteriously, and then he lowered his voice so 
that Gypsy, from the door-steps where she was 
sitting, could not hear what it was. She was 
incapable of trying to listen, so she turned away 
and began to make statuettes out of the damp 
snow. Every now and then, however, she 
caught a word: “East Yorkbury.” “Who’ll 
be the wiser?” “But — I don’t know — ” 
“ Prime fun.” “ Pshaw ! man ! where ’s the 
harm ? There ’ll be — ” Then mysterious 
whispers again, and at last Francis walked off 
whistling, and Tom came back. He had 
forgotten all about the snowballs ; he looked 
perplexed and thoughtful, and sat down on the 
steps without saying a word. Gypsy waited a 
minute, then kicked over her statuettes and 
walked abruptly into the house, a little 
disappointed, but too proud to ask for anything that 
he did not choose to give her. 

That night she went to singing-school with 



Sarah Rowe. Tom did not go ; he said he was 
going to be busy ; at which Gypsy wondered a 
little, but said nothing. 

“ Francis wouldn’t come to-night, either,” said 
Sarah, as they went in together. “ He ’s gone 


to a billiard-match over at East Yorkbury, I 
believe, or something of the sort. At least I 
heard him talking to Bob Guest about it, only 
he said I mustn’t tell.” 

Gypsy stopped short, her face flushing. 

“ What time — do you know what time he was 
going?” 

“ I don’t remember exactly, — half-past seven, 
I think. Anyway, I know he expected to be 
home before it was very late. I suppose he 
thought father would have something to say 
about it. That East Yorkbury tavern is a horrid 
place. I should be ashamed to be seen there if 
I were Francis. But what’s the matter? Where 
on earth are you going? ” 

“ Home.” 

“ Home? ” 

“ I don’t believe I care to stay to the meeting,” 
said Gypsy, hurriedly; “it’s twenty-five miniates 
after seven now, and how few have come. I 
don’t believe it’s going to be much of a meet- 
ing. Besides, I ’ve just thought of something I 


want to do.” 


“ But there ’s the solo in ‘ Star of the Evening
— what shall we do without you ? Oh, 
there ’s George Castles up in the corner, look- 
ing at you like everything. I know he means 
to come home with you.” 

But Sarah suddenly discovered that she was 
talking to the empty entry. Gypsy had slipped 
out and down the steps. 

She started homewards on a rapid walk, 
which soon broke into a run. The moon was 
full, and the snow-covered hills and fields, bright 
in the light, looked like a picture cut in pearl. 
At any other time the beauty and the hush 
would have carried Gypsy away into a world 
of deli ghtful young dreams. To-night she had 
something else to think about. The girls and 
boys on their way to singing-school stopped 
and wondered as she ran past them, calling 
after her ; she scarcely allowed herself time to 
answer, but flew on, flushed and panting, till 
she had left them out of sight, and was at last 
alone upon the moonlit road. 

Not quite alone, though. The sound of 

sleigh-bells broke suddenly on the air, and a 
dark bay horse and slight cutter turned a near 
corner, and swept up to her, and shot past her, 
and left her standing like a statue. 

Two men were in the sleigh, and the light as 
they passed struck their faces sharply. They 
were Francis Rowe and Tom. 

Gypsy stood a moment looking after them, 
shocked and puzzled and helpless ; then a quick 
thought flashed brightly over her face ; she 
started with a bound, and sprang away towards 
home. 

She was very near it, — nearer than she had 
thought ; it took her but a moment to reach the 
end of the garden, to climb the fence, to wade 
through the snow that lay deeply on the
flower-beds, and so come out into the back yard. The 
house was still and dark. Her father and 
mother were both out to tea, and Winnie was 
in bed. Patty’s light glimmered from the 
kitchen where she nodded half asleep over her 
sewing. 

Gypsy went directly to the barn, unlocked 


the stable door, and peered into the dark stall 
where old Billy was sedately dreaming over last 
summer’s clover-tops. She untied his halter, 
pulled him out with a jerk, and saddled and 
bridled him briskly. She had done it many 
times before, when Tom and her father were 
both away, but it was always opposed to Billy’s 
theories of the eternal fitness of things, and to 
be called away from one’s dreams and one’s 
clover at such an unearthly hour, by a girl was 
certainly adding insult to injury. His justifiable 
displeasure thereat he signified — as I have no 
doubt I should have done if I had been in his 
place — by backing into the stall, tossing his 
head just one inch beyond her reach, sidling 
away when she was ready to mount, biting her 
fingers, and nipping her arms, and treading on 
her dress, and otherwise playing the agreeable, 
till her patience and temper were nearly ex- 
hausted. Finally, by dint of threats, persua- 
sion, and diplomacy, she succeeded, to his 
intense mortification and disgust, in mounting, 
and whipped him out into the cold night air. 


There were two roads to East Yorkbury, a 
long one, and a short one which had been cut 
across for farmers through the fields. Tom 
and Francis would take the long one, for there 
was no sleighing upon the other. There was a 
chance, just a chance, that a swift rider through 
the fields might intercept them. But the snow 
lay deep and drifted and roughly broken ; and 
Billy was neither so young nor so free as he 
might have been. However, Gypsy was not 
a girl to give up very easily to obstacles. She 
could but try at least; trying would do no harm. 

So she whipped and coaxed Billy into a 
canter, and swept away through the moonlight, 
over the lonely road. It was very lonely. 
There was not a sound to be heard but the 
heavy plunges of the horse through the drifted 
snow, and the sighing of the wind through the 
trees. Her own shadow took strange shapes as 
it leaped along beside her on the moonlit bank 
and wall. The fields and woods stretched out 
each side of her in fantastic patches of light and 
shade, solitary and still. Gypsy was not afraid, 



she was too much troubled about Tom to be 
afraid ; but she had a bleak, cold, deserted 
feeling which made that singular ride one long 
to be remembered. She was haunted by vague, 
half-formed fears for Tom, too; by new and 
horrible mistrust of him ; by a dread that she 
should be too late. But if she were not too 
late, what then? She hardly knew what then. 
She had formed no plans as to what she should 
do or say. She had come because she could 
not help it ; she was going on because she 
could not help it. Tom might not listen to 
her ; he might be very angry ; it might do 
more harm than good that she had come. But 
here she was, and she trusted to her own 
instinct to guide her. Gypsy’s instincts were, 
however, sad blunders sometimes. Whether 
this one was a blunder or something else, the 
event only would prove. 

The event came very near not proving at all. 
She had ridden through the last patch of pine 
woods, and come out into a broad stretch of 
light, level ground, from which the main road 


was faintly visible, winding away to East York- 
bury tavern. Billy, thoroughly exhausted, was 
panting painfully, head hanging, and ears 
lopped down ; his heavy plunges had changed 
into a feeble trot; the trot was settling 
gradually to a walk, and when Billy made up his 
mind to walk, that was the end of him. When 
hark! — yes, the sound of sleigh-bells, and the 
voices of unseen drivers upon the winding road. 

Gypsy uttered a little cry, and threw her 
arms about the horse’s neck, as if he had been 
human. 

“ Oh, Billy, please! Can’t you go a little 
faster? I don’t want Tom to go.” And Billy 
pleased. Whether he understood what Tom 
had to do with it I cannot state ; but at the 
word he jerked his drooping head with a snort, 
and broke away like a wild thing under the 
touch of Gypsy’s whip. 

The cutter with its fleet bay was just slewing 
past the cart-road, when an apparition of a girl 
on a white horse galloped up, and Francis reined 
in with a shout. 


She made a picture ; her net had come off, 
and her hair was blown back from her face in 
the strong wind ; her cheeks were scarlet, her 
lips a little pale, and her eyes on fire. For an
