courtesy, joined with the pangs of hunger, impelled her to 
accept. 

"I thank you very much," she said, proudly. " Now I 
must go and find Maggie." 

" Where do yer live ?" 

" With Maggie's cousin," was the dignified answer. 

"But what's her name, and where's the street?" 

"Her name is Mrs. Brown. It is you go through 
Broadway, and up ever so many stairs." 

"Yer lost, child, that what's the matter. Now you jest 
wait 'til a p'leceman comes along, and we'll tell him. He'll 
take yer ter station-house, and there yer'll be snug as a 
bug in a rug 'til yer folks come to find yer I" 

That thought roused the child's terror again. The 
policeman would take her to the dreaded island Maggie 
had spoken of, and then she might not see her dear papa 
when he came. Perhaps she had been very naughty not 
to call Maggie mamma. If she could go straight to her 
mamma in heaven! Did people always have to be cov- 
ered in a box, and put in the ground, she wondered !

"I had better try to find Maggie," she said with sudden 
strength and resolution. Then a flush of embarrassment 
overspread her face as she added, " I should like to pay you 
for the cake, but I have no money. I will ask Maggie to 
do it to-morrow." 

"Never you mind, my chicken. For a poor old body, to 
be sure, but I don't grudge a bite to a stray. And if you 
don't find her, come back, and we'll do the best we can." 

"Thank you." 

"Ye'r welcome fer the sake of yer purty face. Now 
d' think yer can find her ? I'm afeard that's to Broad- 
way, and may the saints attind ye, for sure they'd be 
main cruel if they didn't!" 

Our poor little waif turned in the right direction, but 
did not keep it long, bewildered by the strangeness of her 
surroundings. A little girl lost in a great city, too timid 





to ask, and peering cautiously into women's faces to find 
some trace of her lost nurse ! She wiped away her tears 
quietly as she went on with uncertain step. 

And now the streets began to fill with people again. 
There was a jostling and hurrying, cries of newsboys, 
laughing shrieks of children, rattling of wagons, jangling 
of car-bells, the jargon of slang, interspersed with profan- 
ity, the strange tongues, and noisy hubbub. No wonder 
she shrank away, not even daring to look wide-eyed and 
wistful. 

Here limbs ached, and her feet were sore. Oh, what 
could she do I "Maggie! "she cried, softly; "Maggie!" 
but only the babel of confusion answered her. Sobs 
shook her slender frame, and now the tears fell fast. 

She had wandered by this time to the festering by-ways 
of the city. The vile odors sickened the child, so long 
used to fragrant country air. The streets were heaps of 
filth; the sidewalk swarmed with dirty children. Some 
one caught her roughly, another jeered at her, a tongue 
was thrust almost into her face, and she found herself sur- 
rounded by a mocking crowd. 

"Ain't I fine ! Ain't I fine ! Fm goin' to the ball, I am. 
Say, Sis, lend me your button boots ! oh my, white kid ! 
Look at me ! n and the girl, about her own size, picked up 
her filthy, tattered skirts, and wriggled about with the airs 
of a would-be fine lady. 

"Lem me yer sash, won't yer? Why didn't yer have 
red that's all the style ?" 

" How much for yer wig, Sis ? ' 

" I say, gim'me a penny ! You've got lots in your pock- 
ets, I know, and a goold ring on your finger " 

" Oh, I know ! " shrieked another. " She dances at the 
theaytre. Look at the gold chain on her neck ! " 

She turned from one to another, and beheld only a group 
of mocking, cruel faces. The grand virtues of pity and 
mercy seldom course in the blood of street Arabs, who are 





trained by the stern instincts of self-preservation to raise 
their hand against every one, and too often to lead the 
attack. Brown, handsome creatures, some of them, under 
the dirt and rags ; but with the limbs of infant gods, they 
united the foul fierceness of fiends, for brutes are rarely so 
cruel. 

Hounded thus, shivering with terror, weak and helpless 
against her tormentors, she gave one wild, piercing cry, 
and sprang at them as if to force a way through with her 
small white hands. 

" Hillo ! What's all this row?" exclaimed a coarse but 
not unfriendly voice. "Teddy McGinnis, what are you 
doing here in a crowd of girls I n and a well-directed cuff 
sent the urchin sprawling. " Liz Levy, you let that young 
nn alone or I'll smash your mug ! What are you all doing 
to her?" 

The crowd fell back. Tim Chafhey was not to be 
braved in any street encounter, as these little roughs knew 
to their sorrow. 

Oh, save me ! save me !" the child shrieked, throwing 
herself in his arms. 

An angry woman rushed oat and caught one of the rag- 
amuffins by the hair of her head, and hustled her up an 
alley way. 

"What did you do to her ?" demanded the champion. 
"Be off, or I'll break your heads? Now, what is it, poor 
little thing ? How did you come here ? n 

She was sobbing so hysterically that she could not utter 
a word, yet she clung to him with frantic desperation. 

"You're lost, I 'spose that's the trouble. Shall I take 
you to a station-house, or will you tell me. You're a sight 
too nice to live in these holes, or even in Kelly's palace," 
with a broad grin. How did you get here ? " 

" I wa wa want Maggie ! " she sobbed. 

"And who's Maggie? There, don't cry so! Come, 
we'll get out of this beastly hole. Now tell me all about 





jtl Who's your dad, and where does he hang out f He 
must be a reg'lar buster!'' eyeing her with curious sur- 
prise. 

" I want Maggie ! I lost her when we went to cross the 
street Broadway. And I've looked, and looked. Oh, 
what shall I do?" 

" She wasn't your mammy, of course ?" 

" No. My mamma is in heaven with the angels. Mag- 
gie was mamma's maid, and we came to New York for 
papa, who is way across the sea. n 

Tim Chafney looked puzzled. 

" When did you come to New York?' 

On Tuesday." 

"And you was crossing Broadway! How ever did you 
get way over here ? I'd best hunt up a peeler." 

"A what?" in wild-eyed terror. 

"P'liceman " 

"Oh, don't ! don't ! " she implored, hysterically. 

" What then ? will you go home with me ? " 

" Oh, yes. Take me ! I will be so good. I will stop 
crying right away only I cannot help it. It all comes 
up in my throat, and I'm so tired. And then you'll go 
iook for Maggie ? " 

How beseeching the little voice sounded, broken with 
convulsive sobbing. 

"You poor little kid! I'm afraid I couldn't find her 
to-night ; but I'll take you home, and then we will see in 
the morning." 

"You will not let any one hurt me, I know," with trust- 
ing eagerness. 

"You may bet your head on that! Come, chip up a 
bit. This way, it's not far." 

Then Tim Chafney suddenly plunged his remaining 
hand into his pocket, and himself into a thoughtful mood, 
and gave a long, low whistle. Mother Mell was not 
always in a serene mood, and at times somewhat free with 




her bony knuckles. And Tim's father was rather tricky 
but then what could he do to a little girl who could not 
be robbed or cheated at cards, nor even made drunk, and 
important secrets wormed out of her ? 

Then he took a curious survey of his protege. The 
dainty white dress was sadly tumbled and soiled, but 
there was a style to it quite different from the tawdry 
finery the women in Tim's circle displayed. And though 
her eyes were swollen, and her face flushed with weeping, 
she was still lovely, something above Tim's comprehen- 
sion, and he suddenly felt ashamed to offer her the hospi- 
talities of his dingy abode. 

"But then it's only for one night," he ruminated. To- 
morrow I'll hunt up her folks. Poor thing I She wasn't 
meant to take life rough-and-tumble, as we do. And so 
her mammy's dead " 

"I'm so tired," she said; and the weary little face 
turned toward him with touching wistfulness. 

"We'll soon be there, and you shall have some supper. 
How long ago were you lost ? " 

^ This morning. We went out after breakfast, and Mag. 
gie bought such nice bananas! Oh, my dear Maggie !" 
and the child began to weep afresh. 







CHAPTER IL 

IN A HOSPITAL WAED. 

MEANWHILE, what had befallen Maggie? She heard a 
cry and missed the tug at her skirt, and turned to see a 
flash as of a skimming swallow, then an omnibus hid it. 
Stupified, she did not notice the span of horses coming 
down, and the indecision, of the moment was fatal. The 
pole struck her, the horses trampled her under their feet, 
then were jerked up suddenly by the driver, and the car- 
riage stopped. 

" Oh, what has happened ?" cried the lady occupant. 

" I will see ; " and the gentleman sprang out. 

The girl lay bleeding and insensible. The coachman and 
Mr. Byington were at once surrounded by a throng of cu- 
tious pedestrians, and a policeman made his appearance. 

"I'm awfully sorry," declared the coachman. "She 
dodged right under the horses heads, though I jerked them 
np in a flash." 

"Not killed, is she?" 

" Bring her to the sidewalk.' 

"Take her to the nearest drug store," commanded Mr. 
Byington. "I hold myself responsible for the poor thing's 
injuries." 

They picked her up carefully, and a gaping crowd fol- 
lowed. 

His wife leaned out of the window, while he made a brief 
explanation, then ordered the carriage to follow him. When 
they reached the drug store she summoned her husband. 

"Edward," she said sympathetically, "have the unfortu 
Date creature taken to St. Luke's Hospital. We know she 



will have the best of care, and I cannot bear to think oi 
her being huddled into any overcrowded public place." 

"I will see to it," he made answer. 

The crowd was peremptorily dismissed. The woman 
being removed to an inner apartment an examination was 
speedily made. One arm was broken and the flesh much 
mangled. A cut just at the edge of her forehead, a bruise 
on her cheek, and, it was feared, some internal injuries as 
she remained insensible so long. 

The officer had gathered up her parcels and her reticule. 
Mr. Byington searched it, as well as her pocket-book, but 
no clue to her address was found. 

" I wish her taken to St. Luke's Hospital," he said at 
length. " Present this card and there will be no delay. 
To-morrow Mrs. Byington will visit her, and everything in 
our power will be done. Lift her carefully, poor thing." 

He re-entered the carriage and imparted the meagre facts 
to his wife. 

"I suppose she was alone, then! Why will people never 
learn to carry a card with their name and address ! But 
we may be able to discover her friends as soon as she re- 
turns to reason. I only hope there are no little ones at 
home watching and waiting for their mother." 

When Margaret Donald returned to thorough conscious- 
ness she had been an inmate of the hospital ten days, suf- 
fering from congestion and fever, and though her kind 
nurses had not actually despaired of her life, still she had 
lain in a very critical state. The cut and bruises had 
mended, and there was only the broken arm. 

" Where am I ? " she asked in a feeble tone. 

The low voiced sisters briefly explained. 

'Ten days!" she exclaimed in a tone of anguish, start- 
ing up wildly. Oh, my God! what has become of Elsi- 
nore my darling Miss Nora ! " 

" Hush ; you must not excite yourself in this manner,' 
was the soft entreaty. " One of our patrons, Mrs. Bying- 





ton, had yon sent here. Their carriage accidently ran over 
you, and she has been every day to see you." 

" Did she take Nora ? Tell me quick ! " and the poor 
thing clutched the nurse's arm in frantic eagerness, staring 
out of feverish eyes. 

"I do not know, though I think it probable. She will 
tell you when she comes. There, you must be quiet, or 
you will not be able to see her." 

"When will it be?" and the tremulous voice was 
freighted with anxiety. 

" At three, this afternoon. Try to compose yourself and 
be patient." 

Margaret turned her face to the wall, and the nurse left 
her presently. But there was no quiet for the newly- 
awakened brain. It seemed to her as if the slow moments 
would never count up their accustomed hours. Like a 
picture, everything came back to her up to the moment 
when she had seen Nora flying wildly back to the opposite 
walk. 

The lady made her appearance at last. A sweet, gracious- 
looking person, hardly of middle age, with one of those 
finely-modulated, soothing voices. 

"Where is the child?" Maggie almost shrieked, so 
wrought up had her nerves become in the interval. " The 
little girl who was with me that fatal day ?" 

" Little girl ! " and Mrs. Byington glanced at her in the 
utmost surprise. " Why, you were quite alone when they 
picked you up ! Oh, surely, it was not your child ? " she 
cried anxiously. 

" It was the child of my dead mistress, but as dear to me 
as my own life. Oh, Nora ! Nora ! where are you ? I must 
get up and search. Oh, surely, she was not killed ! " 

" She was not killed ; she was not even there, I am quite 
sure. Could she not find her way home, or to some friend ? 
She could tell where she lived, or was she too young?" 

"She did not know. She had never been in the city 





before. I brought her here ; I was to wait until we heard 
from her father. Oh, God help me if she is lost ! I shall 
go crazy." 

"Try to calm yourself, and tell me the story," said Mrs. 
Byington, in a voice that exercised a peculiar power over the 
sick woman. " We can advertise, you know, and search 
the police stations. My husband will do everything in his 
power. We have both regretted the accident so deeply.'' 

" But she may have starved or perished ! A little girl 
barely seven, and so unused to cities. You see I was stay- 
ing with my cousin, and had been there but two days, 
Oh, heaven keep her!" 

a If you will collect your thoughts and give me a de 
scription of the child, we will have advertisements in dif- 
ferent papers to-morrow morning. First, had the child 
any jewelry, or rich clothing?" 

" Nothing but a chain and cross that her mother always 
wore. Her portrait is at my cousin's ; if you could see 
that. Oh, what will Ellen think ! " 

Margaret Donald broke into an uncontrollable fit of 
weeping. Mrs. Byington tried to calm her, and at length 
obtained a somewhat coherent account of the situation, and 
a description of the child. 

" I think she will be easily found," was the reassuring 
rejoinder. " The name is unusual, and she is old enough to 
tell her own story. Do not fear, my poor girl, I will drive 
to your cousin's at once, and explain your disappearance." 

" Oh, if you will ; " and the wild eyes were raised with an 
expression of fervent gratitude. Tell her she will find 
the locket in a small box, inlaid with pearl, nearly at the 
bottom of the trunk. It belonged to my dear mistress. 
Oh, my darling, my child that I loved too well! Have I 
failed in my trust through that very love ? " 

" We shall obtain some clue, I am very sure. Strive to 
be composed and hopeful. You cannot blame yourself, for 
It seems the result of an almost unavoidable accident in a 





crowded street. I know my coachman is one of the most 
jonsiderate drivers, and yet I feel as if the fault was 
wholly ours. Depend upon our doing everything in our 
power." 

" Oh, thank you, thank you ! " said she ; and the sad, wist- 
ful eyes overflowed with tears. 

Sister Agnes was summoned, and she viewed her patient 
with some alarm. 

" I am afraid she will be worse,'' began the visitor, " but 
it was absolutely necessary that we should have this con- 
versation. She has a great anxiety to battle with, and 
everything needful must be done for her. I can only com- 
mend her to your care, and the wisdom of God." Then, 
rising 

" I will be in again to-morrow, as usual, with some good 
rews I hope." 

" Drive to East Tenth Street," she said to the coachman 
as she entered the carriage. 

Ellen Brown occupied a floor of a tenement house, in a 
rather dingy brick row. 

"Couldn't I do the errand for you ma'am?" asked 
Michael. M Perhaps the person would step out." 

"No, I must go in. I may stay some fifteen or twenty 
minutes. It does not look dangerous," and Mrs. Byington 
smiled. 

She picked her way up to the third floor. The place 
was tolerably clean inside, though the air was close and 
not over fragrant. Mrs. Brown was at home ; a nice, tidy 
woman, with three little ones. 

She had been almost wild with anxiety at her cousin's 
sudden disappearance. Margaret and the child had only 
been her guests for three days. She gave a minute de- 
scription of the child, and together they searched the 
trunk. The box was soon discovered and inspected. 

" What a lovely child ! " exclaimed Mrs. Byington, as 
Ellen opened the locket. 





Indeed she is. That was taken two years ago, but she 
is hardly as large now as my Teddy, and he isn't six yet. 
And she's so shy of strangers, the little thing ! Why, it 
will about kill her to be lost," and Mrs. Brown wiped away 
a tear. 

"I must drive around to the police stations at once. 
There is not a moment to be lost. And now, Mrs. Brown, 
if you can find the time, I think it will be a good thing for 
you to come down and see your cousin. I am deeply 
obliged for your ready assistance." 

" Oh, thank you ma'am, don't mention it. I am ready 
to do anything, and I'm so glad to hear a word from her. 
Poor John will be mightily relieved." 

With a cordial adieu, Mrs. Byington went back to her 
carriage. From thence, till night, she drove from one 
station to another, and received telegrams ; but no word of 
any stray child answering her description. 

Mr. Byington looked very grave over her tidings, as she 
detailed them on her return. 

" If we could only have known this in the beginning ! " 
he said. " The child may have fallen into bad hands, but 
I think a liberal reward might bring her to light. We will 
hope, at least." 

Margaret tossed restlessly upon her bed. The fever had 
returned, but not with any alarming violence. Still her 
poor brain wandered, and she lived over the past, so recent 
and so sad. One picture stood out more boldly than the 
rest, and with the fatal persistence of fever she went over 
and over the strange incident. 

A brilliant June afternoon it was. She had obeyed her 
mistress' small behests. The funeral expenses were paid, 
the furniture sold, the two trunks, packed and strapped, 
standing in the narrow hall. To-morrow they were to go 
to New York. The girl sat by the open window in a 
thoughtful mood, while little Nora, tired out with weeping 
for her dead mamma, lay asleep in the next room. 





Margaret was startled by the stopping of a hack before 
the door. Mechanically she rose and opened it. 

" Mrs. Waldeburgh lived here ? " the man asserted. 

" She did. She is dead. Perhaps you do not know ? " 
and Maggie studied him in vague surprise. 

" That's what I told the missus in my hack. But she 
wanted to see you or some one." 

" Very well, if her business is with me." 

" It's all right," he exclaimed, nodding toward the hack, 
and going back assisted his passenger, who stepped to the 
sidewalk with the air of an empress. A tall, magnificent 
woman, past middle life perhaps, but still retaining the 
blooming appearance of youth. Her dark hair was scarcely 
threaded by silver, her complexion was fresh, and both 
face and figure preserved the softly rounded contour of 
beauty. Her hands and feet were exquisite. Maggie re- 
marked the one as she descended the carriage steps, and 
the other as she held her fan and parasol. Who could she 
be? 

" You are Mrs. Waldeburgh's housekeeper, or maid, or 
attended her in some capacity ? " and the brilliant hazel- 
eyes startled and fascinated Margaret Donald. 

" Yes," she answered, in amazement. 

" Then I have found the right person. Driver, come for 
me in about an hour. Do not fail." 

The man touched his hat and sprang up in his seat. 

" Will you walk in ? " Maggie asked rather timidly. 

"Certainly, my good woman, I came on some important 
business. Are we quite alone ? " and she glanced furtively 
around. 

" Yes, except that my little Miss Nora is asleep in the 
next room." 

" Oh ! " and a peculiar expression passed over the hand- 
some face. " And who may your Miss Nora be, pray ? " 

" Mrs. Waldeburgh's little girl j " and Maggie began to 
eye her visitor askance. 




Ah I What is her age ? " 

"Seven, but she Is quite small She hag been very 
rfelicate until the last year or two." 

" Are there any more children ? " 

"No; she lost two little boys with scarlet-fever just 
before I came to her, about two years ago." 

"Do you know anything of the child's father?" 

Maggie hesitated. What was to be the result of all 
this questioning? 

" He is not in America, I think. You need not be afraid 
to speak out. Indeed, you may be perfectly frank with 
me. I am an old friend of her father's family, and for 
their sakes I wish to learn a few of the particulars respect- 
ing her." 

" And you want to take the child I " cried Maggie in 
affright. w But you cannot. My mistress gave her to me 
to keep for her father." 

" My good woman, do not get alarmed so easily. No 
one wants the child, so far as I have heard. Perhaps 
you may know that your mistress married against her 
father's wishes was, in fact, disinherited for her disobe- 
dience?'' 

"She had a stepmother " and Maggie glanced up 
timidly. 

"Yes." Not a tint of rising color or embarrassment 
served to fasten Maggie's half-suspicion on the superb 
woman before her, who fanned herself languidly, filling the 
air with the pungent perfume of sandal-wood. " But I 
think that had little to do with it. The man was a penni- 
less adventurer, passing himself off as some German or 
Italian count w 

"He was a Hungarian," said Maggie, with a kind of 
sturdy truthfulness. 

"It matters little. Miss Grenville might have chosen 
where she liked. I shall not spend time to argue minor 
points she chose in the face of her father's prohibition, 





and left her home with this fellow. Indeed, her family do 
not believe she ever was married." 

" But she was ! she was ! " exclaimed Maggie with an 
indignant flush. " I have seen her certificate." 

"That may be, too," with an imperious gesture of the 
hand. " Such a thing could easily be forged, you know. 
Her father would need a witness to convince him of the 
fact. A few letters passed between them as I under- 
stood it, and I was at that time quite interested in the 
misguided girl. At different intervals her father has, 
through his business man, learned that she was not actually 
suffering. Then he heard that she had been deserted." 

"She was not deserted!" exclaimed Maggie angrily. 
" Her husband was persuaded to return to his native land 
by an uncle, and there was a fortune coming to him " 

The incredulous smile on the handsome face opposite, 
embarrassed Maggie. 

" And then there was some political trouble." 

Exactly," with a rather derisive nod. " And the gen- 
tleman has not returned. Meanwhile, his wife dies 
shall I say of a broken heart ? We scarcely believe in 
such things now-a-days." 

" She loved him ! She had the utmost faith in him. I 
am to keep the child " 

Maggie studied the face of her visitor. It was high- 
bred, proud to haughtiness, but quite impassible. Was 
there some underplot to gain possession of the child? 

" I see you do not trust me at all," and the visitor 
smiled with a fascinating touch of grace and pardon. " I 
will be still more explicit. Mr. Grenville desired to know 
just what his daughter's circumstances were, and to give 
her some aid, unknown. So they consulted me, as I was 
coming north, and I was shocked, I must admit, when I 
heard last night of her death. I hope she did not want 
for anything ? " 

" She did not," the girl answered shortly.
