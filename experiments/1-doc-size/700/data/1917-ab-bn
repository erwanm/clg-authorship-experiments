she's got, she and Ellie." 



The lot belonged to this place years ago," said his 
mother, ranging herself with her husband against her own 
conviction. " It's natural for your father to want it 
back." 

" I don't call it natural," said Ben. He was frowning. 
His chestnut brows lost their wistful look and became 
grave. " I call it mean. No matter how they came by 
it, it's theirs." 

" Your fathered buy it," said Mary. " He'd pay them 
a good price." 

"Well," said Ben, "they wouldn't have a roof over 
their heads." 

It was an old-fashioned way to put it, and Mary asked 
involuntarily : 

"Where'd you get that? Who'd you hear say they 
wouldn't have a roof over their heads? " 

" She said it herself, — Mrs. Brock." 

" You haven't been thorning her about it? " 

" No, 'course not. But last night she said it to Ellen, 
just as I was going in. Ellie was crying, and her mother 
said, * Anyway we've got a roof over our heads.' " 

"Why!" said Mary. She flushed slightly with the 
interest of it. "D'you go over there last night? " 

" Yes," said Ben. He was looking absently out of the 
window now, at the waving green. 

"Before I went?" 

« No, after." 

" I don't know as I should have let you, if I'd known 
it," said Mary gravely, " the day of the funeral so. I 
shouldn't have gone myself, if your father hadn't insisted 
on it." 

" Oh, I went because it was the day of the funeral," said 
Ben, with a cheerful belief in himself. " I knew they'd 
be feeling bad, and I thought that was the time to go." 



 

" Well ! " said his mother. She put the spools back in 
her basket hastily. It seemed to her his mind had taken 
a safe sidetrack and the emergency was over. But Ben 
had returned to it by another route. 

« We've got acres of land," said he, " acres and acres." 

" Ben," said his mother, the more emphatically because 
she was speaking against her own convictions, " when you 
are older, you will understand how anybody might want 
to have a big place just as it was when the township was 
first settled, same as your father does." 

" I shouldn't," said Ben, in unexpected aptness, " if I 
had to get it away from the fatherless and the widow." 

He was not given to pious expression, and his mother 
was the less prepared. 

"Now," she said blankly, "where'd you get that?" 

"The minister said it at the funeral," returned Ben. 
" That ain't anything to say. It's only another way of 
putting it. That's what you can't get used to, mum. 
You know Ellie's father's dead, and you know Ardelia 
Brock's a widow. It's my saying it the way the minister 
did that knocks you. But what I want to know is, are 
you truly going to mind him and go over there and beg 
Mrs. Brock's land away from her? ", 

"Yes," said Mary, returning to the dignity that was 
often her marital defense. " I've told you once. But I'll 
tell you again, so you can put it out of your mind." She 
stopped short, her head up, listening, raising her hand 
also to enjoin his silence. Ben listened an instant, and 
turned to leave the room. 

« Yes, that's Hugh," he called back to her, "up attic." 

" Oh," said his mother, rising from her chair, alert and 
anxious, " he's practicing. You tell him — '' 

Still she listened, her head bent and her face all a 
frowning intentness. It only relaxed when the violin 



 

broke off half-way in its climbing scale. Then, in a mo- 
ment more, she heard the two boys clattering down the 
stairs, and began putting the room in order. She moved 
a chair an inch or two, straightened a rug, and was spe- 
ciously busy when her sons came in. Even to Hugh she 
had never owned that it was less than politic for him to 
play when his father was in hearing. She only invented 
little pretexts for calling him away from his loved task, 
and while he was at it watched and listened as a mother 
animal does when the cub is in danger. The boys came 
in together, and she smiled at them. They knew the smile. 
It was the special brand she used when she was protecting 
their father from what they knew to be their just con- 
clusions. 

" Hugh," said she, " will you move that backlog a mite 
to the left? It's too heavy for me." Then, for the arti- 
fice seemed as foolish to her as it did to them, she amended 
her speech. " Anjrways, it's heavier'n I often tackle.'' 

But Hugh made no pretense of carrying out her subter- 
fuge. He stood there gazing gravely at her, his mind 
still with his violin. 

" I looked out of the window once or twice," he said. 
" I didn't think he'd got back." 

" He's been back half an hour," said Ben. 

He went to the fireplace and adjusted the backlog, mov- 
ing it a little as his mother had prescribed. He did it to 
save her scruples, and he was the one to do it, she was 
aware, not because he respected her state of feeling more 
•than his brother did, but because his mind was more open 
to it. Not only to-day, but all days, Hugh's mind was with 
his violin as with a love he could approach by stealth 
only. He was either wondering whether he could slip off 
to Larry Greene in the back road and take a lesson, or 



 

get an hour's stolen practicing, or accomplish his grow- 
ing purpose and run away to a place where you were 
taught to play the violin by somebody who had made a 
name though playing it. As he stood there in his dark 
dream, his brows, beautiful black arcs drawn together, 
Mary glanced at him and felt the ecstatic pang of that 
mother-love she had for them both, but chiefly, though 
she had never owned it to herself, for Hugh, because he 
was her first-bom. She had for him a mingling of emo- 
tions borne like flowers on the rushing tide of her younger 
married life. He meant his father to her, his father 
when Mary had accepted his imperious sway with a pas- 
sionate desire tq give more even than he asked of her, to 
bum herself and her will on the altar of his just mastery. 
Hugh looked like him, too, dark, commanding, no trace 
near his firm mouth of the hated dimple, yet with some- 
thing his father never had: a sweetness of radiant faith, 
a warm unbending to what he loved. He had been an 
enchanting baby to her, and in his approaching man- 
hood he was still enchanting, the more poignantly because 
she knew how thwarted he was in his dear purposes. Ben 
always seemed abundantly able to pluck what he wanted 
off the tree of lifeflimt there were reasons why she could 
never think of him with an untroubled mind. He belonged 
to the later time when she had begun to escape from her 
husband in the secret desires of her soul, when overflowing 
love for him had been merged in obedience, when, even 
with little Hugh in her arms, she longed for the free air 
of youth at play, and the more passionately because she 
knew, by the terms of her bond, it would be denied her. 
And this was the time when, seeing paths of pleasure — pa- 
thetic little paths that led only to ribbons or a dance in 
town — she had longed to escape and take her joy of 




 

them. She looked about at other wives who managed 
cleverly and lied about it, and wondered if the lie was 
theirs or his who drove them to it, and then gravely kept 
her road* It was hard, seeing Mary Neale now in her 
majestic middle years, to suspect she had ever been 
tempted by trivial things ; but she had known imseasoned 
youth, with all youth's longings. And at that time 
of indignant servitude Ben had come, as she afterward 
thought, along the path of her desire for pleasure. Some- 
times when she was in church and heard the minister talk 
about the soul, she was warmly moved, and sat there blush- 
ing with the glory of it: to think she knew Hugh's soul, 
with its reaching desires, its shy fancies and aching loyal- 
ties. And then she would grow cold, and stop thinking 
about souls. For there was her other son : she had given 
him a beautiful body — but what more? 

Hugh was recalling her. 

"Mother," said he, "do you s'pose the Brocks have 
got any money? " 

His face had cleared of its dreamy absorption, and 
showed an intentness of interest in the thing he had to 
say. The question irritated her. It seemed to her she 
had got to encoimter them all, her husband, her sons and 
later Ardelia Brock herself, on the topic of Ardelia's for- 
tunes. 

" For mercy sake ! " she said, " what do you want to 
know that for? " 

"I shouldn't think they would have anything," said 
Hugh, ignoring her warmth. "Larry Greene was all 
broke up last night because she asked to get trusted for 
the coffin." 

" How's Larry Greene know? " said his mother impa- 
tiently. 

" He heard it over to Elkins', The men sit around there 



 

and talk. Maybe she's borrowed of Larry now. Maybe 
he made her. I don't know." 

" Sometimes I think you'd better not go over to Larry 
Greene's so much,", said Mary helplessly. " Your father 
don't consider him a very good character, and Elkins' 's 
nothing more nor less than a saloon. 

And immediately she was ashamed of herself, knowing 
she considered Larry a man of character and manners. 

"'Course it's a saloon," said Hugh. "Everybody 
knows that. Mother, when you going over to the 
Brocks' ? " 

" I went last night," said Mary, returning to the con- 
yenient dignity she donned when they questioned her too 
curiously. 

" She's going to-night," said Ben. He had been look- 
ing from one to the other, with the alertness of a clever 
fellow who is determined to possess himself of the situa- 
tion. " She's going over to ask Ardelia Brock — " 

His mother turned upon him. There was that in her 
air they knew and were accustomed to heed. Mary Neale, 
when she did put her foot down, had to be obeyed. 

" That will do, Ben," she said. " Not another word." 

The willfulness faded out of his face. He began to 
kick at the birch wood by the hearth. 

" Let the wood alone," said Mary, thankful to reprove 
him for something tangible. "Now I must get supper. 
Hannah won't be back to-night. You pick me up come 
kindling." 

Ben went silently off through the kitchen. 

He pursed his lips to whistle, but thought better of it, 
especially as his father's step was emphatic in the shed. 
Hugh, too, heard the step, and so did Mary. What hap- 
pened thereupon was precisely what always happened. 
Hugh went out the front way, so swiftly you might have 



 

thought he disappeared by miracle. She was used to 
these expert flights when the boys heard their father 
coming, and thought she had only postponed reasoning them 
out of an act so palpably lacking in respect ; but she did 
know there was unhappy cause for it, and to^y it hurt 
her more than ever. 



At supper that night, no one talked. Neale did not 
wittingly snuff out the spark of sociability, but his mind 
was unbrokenly on* affairs; for him, conversation as an 
art or a means of pleasure, did not exist. When he saw 
the boys laughing together, it seemed an ebulHfibn inci- 
dent to their youth; but if his wife joined them, he glanced 
at her briefly in a surprise he was not interested enough 
to satisfy. Nearly all the things he seemed to condemn 
he hardly saw at all. They were outside his vision. 

Sitting there at the table, Mary let her mind stray off 

to Ardelia Brock and her daughter, Ellen. Perhaps she 

was sorrier for the little daughter than for Ardelia even. 

She knew, in a fragmentary way, what Ellen's father had 

been to her. All the neighbors knew. They had said, 

from Ellen's birth, that Ardelia was a good enough mother, 

but that David took more care of the child than she did. 

David, who was now dead, had been a silent, ruminative 

man of no ambitions, but a deep wonder over the earth 

and its miracles and an absorbing love for his daughter. 

He seemed quite contented with days' works for " old 

Mendell " who raised vegetables and fruit for market, with 

mending locks and tinkering here and there. A man of 

a quick mind toward wood and metal he was eager to serve 

them when they were sick and needed him but had no 

ghost of an impulse toward making what would bring him 

in larger moneys. He was quite willing, it seemed, to have 

his wife swell the living account by helping out Larry 

Greene's small housekeeping, and he and Larry spent 


hours when, the neighbors said, they should have been 
at work, in talking, eyes fixed on vacancy, about, the 
neighbors again said, " nothing." But the things they 
turned over and over in those unproductive hours were 
what mankind must always muse upon so long as the earth 
spreads her lure of wonder. David and Ellen were hedged 
about in a solitude of their own. It was, though not of 
their will or knowledge, a solitude closed against Ar- 
delia. And she, not even guessing she was outside, was 
content with her own household tract. Ellen loved her 
mother as she loved the cat and the fireplace and her 
bread and milk; but David had loved her once with all 
the ardor of his imaginative springtime. To the last, 
he did not question her, even in his mind ; but all the sensi- 
tive filaments of it recoiled from her. And, quite uncon- 
sciously, he tried to make of Ellen the child of his own 
desires and though inevitably within the range of her 
mother's silliness unharmed by it. He told her grave 
stories of little girls who were certain to do delightful 
things: chiefly to see the Alps and Westminster Abbey. 
But strangely these little girls never seemed to grow up or 
marry. David, confronted from time to time by the un- 
dying youth of Ardelia's old coquetry, could not bear to 
think of Ellen bridling and holding her head enchantingly, 
if it meant so little — only something to hurt a man with 
in the end, like a golden apple tarnished. He was afraid 
of knowledge for his child, the false knowledge of what is 
called love, and would not even let her go to district 
school, but taught her himself, with the help of Larry 
Greene, so that she knew so little of the world, as children 
have found it in their explorations, that she was like a 
little alien among them, when they did briefly play to- 
gether, and they hooted her. Poor little pioneers who 
can't trust the elders entirely! they have to go out ex- 



 

plormg in squads* But Ellen went alone, timorously, 
and when she found the woods too thick called loudly on 
her father or Larry, and they were always there. For a 
year now she had been one of the dozen free out-of-town 
pupils at the Academy, absorbed in a rapture of the en- 
chantingly new ; but to her father this was a wrench from 
dear habit, a doubt and a ceaseless apprehension. It 
weakened him physically; he would have liked to spend 
the years of his life with a little Ellen, picking thimble- 
berries for her and threading them on a grass spire, tell- 
ing murmured stories in the dark before the fire, and 
counseling her vaguely to " be a good girl" 

Suddenly, Mary was aware, through her musing over 
Ellen, that Neale was speaking to her. He had risen 
from the table — this he always did before his wife — 
and now he stood looking down at her and frowning a 
little because she did not attend directly. 

"You better go over there right away." 

The boys glanced at her in a quick interrogation. Ben, 
not used to waiting for the satisfaction of his curiosities, 
asked eagerly, before his father was outside the door : 

"You going, mother?" 

Mary had not known whether she was going or not. 
She had felt, as her husband spoke, that a grave decision 
was before her. But now she answered at once, and with 
dignity: 

" Yes, I'm going right over." 

Ben looked disappointed; he had hoped for the excite- 
ment of rebellion. But Hugh, like his mother, was 
thoughtful, and when she rose from the table, stood by it 
waiting until Ben had remembered some quest of his own 
and loped off out of doors. 

"Mother," said Hugh, "you wait a minute." 

She was going rapidly back and forth, with a house- 



 

wife's precision of act, piling dishes and carrying away 
the food. Hugh had something difficult to present. It 
made him frown, and the colpr ran into his face. Mary 
knew something important was coming, and with a kindly 
wariness she ceased even her inward interrogation, to let 
him get hold of himself. 

" I guess your aunt don't mean to come down to sup- 
per," she volunteered. " I'll leave out the biscuits. 
'Twon't hurt 'em to dry off a little. I didn't think they 
were extra good, — not so good as Hannah's." 

Hugh plunged his hand into his pocket and brought 
out a wad of money. 

" Mother," said he, "here's six dollars. I want you 
to give it to her." 

"Who?" Mary stopped in her progress to-and-fro. 

" It's for Mrs. Brock." 

" Where'd you get this? " asked his mother, keeping an 
even tone. Yet her eyes brightened, and a warmer red 
ran into her cheeks. She had a glowing sense of the 
beauty of her son's compassion. 

" Aunt Tab gave it to me, a little at a time." 

" But, Hugh, you were saving it." A mother's regret 
that he was to lack the pleasure of his little hoard in no 
way tempered her pride in him. It made it more. 

"What's the use anyway?" said Hugh. "Aunt Tab 
gives it to me to go away with ; but it never'll be enough 
to go on, or to pay for lessons if I went. Sometimes one 
lesson's five dollars, sometimes more. It's no use. So 
you give it to Mrs. Brock." 

Mary shook her head. 

" No, Hugh," said she. " You keep your money. 
About Ardelia — well, I'll do what I can." 

"When folks say that," returned the boy unhappily, 
" they never do anything." 



 

He stuffed the money into his pocket again, and went 
off with a striding step, too much, Mary heavily felt, like 
his father's when circumstance had briefly withstood him. 
She stayed looking at the place where he had been, her 
mind a tumult of remonstrance against the nature of man 
and its ingratitude. She was standing by Hugh, against 
his will, and he was throwing off her compassion with a 
hopeless word. The tears rushed to her eyes, surprising 
her* She was not used to their traitorous overflow. She 
wiped them away, threw a shawl over her shoulders and, 
leaving the dishes for Hannah, went out of the kitchen 
and down the path into the road, to do her errand at 
the little house. It seemed rather foolish to go into the 
road and along to Ardelia's when she might have taken 
a short cut through the orchard, from back door to door. 
But no Neale with the desire of reclaiming the Brock 
place had ever approved of a path across lots. It would 
have threatened to establish some unwelcome intimacy. 
How could you cherish designs against a house you ap- 
proached familiarly? 

It was a small house, with two rooms in front and an 
entry between them. It was set low, entered by one step, 
and that pleasing humility gave it an attractive coziness. 
There were vines, jessamine and a honeysuckle, over the 
trellis at the door, and the very poverty of the place had 
made for a special beauty. Brock had left his clapboards 
unpainted and they had worn gray. Mary did not tap 
at the door. She opened it, in neighborly fashion, and 
found Ardelia in the kitchen, down a step in the ell, sit- 
ting by a side window with her hands folded in her lap, 
while Ellen, the daughter of sixteen, sat at the supper 
table eating bread and milk. Ardelia looked up when 
her neighbor came in. She did not speak, and Mary, 
used to that acceptance of good-will, threw off her shawl 



and took the chair Ellen at once drew forward for her. 
There was greeting in Ellen's haste, a warm desire to show 
her gratitude to one who came to mother while mother 
was so sad. There was no likeness between mother and 
daughter. Ellen was brown, red under the warmth of 
her cheeks, and with an extraordinary look of sincerity in 
the eyes. Some trick of the lids made them seem to be 
asking pathetic questions, assuring you of the desire be- 
hind them to meet you with the clearest answer, if she 
only knew. Her thick hair grew abundantly in a lovely 
line about her forehead, and gave her, for she was still in 
short dresses, an antiquated make of childish clothes worn 
threadbare, a curiously grown-up look, for she had wound 
it in its thick braid on the top of her head. 

"Why, Ellen," said Mrs. Neale, in involuntary com- 
ment, " you've done up your hair." 

Ellen put a hand quickly to the crown of braids, flushed 
and said nothing. 

" I dunno what possessed her," said her mother, in a 
vacuous tone. " She done it up this mornin'." 

Ellen herself could not have explained. She did know 
that when she got up that morning it was to a world en- 
tirely different from any world she could even fancy. 
Though her father had been dead four days, yet until 
yesterday, when he was carried out of the house, it had 
not seemed so irreparable a loss. While his poor body, 
mysteriously left among them for cruel, pathetic observ- 
ances, was still there, it had seemed possible that the ani- 
mating spirit also lingered. It might even, by miracle — 
and she had been told there were miracles — enter again 
into its deserted home. But now he was gone utterly, and, 
perhaps with an unformulated sense of her own new re- 
sponsibilities in his absence, she had made herself a woman. 

" She looks just like him, don't she? " Ardelia contin- 




ued, in the flat voice of one who marvels to no purpose 
and yet must voice her wonder. " Her hair's the color 
of his, an' so's her skin." 

Ellen, as if the discussion now ceased to concern her, 
sat down again at the table and went on with her bread 
and milk. 

« Yes," said Mrs. Neale, " Ellen's the picture of him." 

She was looking compassionately at the wreck of the 
woman before her. Ardelia had been a blonde beauty in 
her youth. Mary remembered her so: too beautiful to 
need cultivate the graces or the virtue of soft ways. All 
eyes turned to follow her in her slim perfection of morn- 
ing color. She had had a wonderful way of carrying her 
head and looking, as one of her lovers said, " slant-ways." 
It was, in her youth, unconscious. Ardelia had been 
bom out of some fortunate mood of the moment, some 
heavenly concourse of the stars. And now,, the radiant 
uplift of the head quite gone, all her color wiped and 
drained away from her by circumstance, she sat in a choco- 
late-colored wrapper and peered dimly and with distrust 
at fate. 

"Delia," said Mary, "you had your supper?" 

" I've had a cup o' tea," said Ardelia. " That'll keep 
me up. I don't feel to eat." 

" Well," said Mary, " you've got to eat to live. We've 
all got to." 

Ellen looked round in a quick, grateful assent. Mrs. 
Neale had confirmed her own inner belief which, added to 
a healthy appetite, had made her finish the bread and 
milk. But Ellen felt in her throat the choking misery 
of grief. She knew it would be easier really, not to eat, 
but to lie down and give way, perhaps cry and cry. 

"I feel queer," said Ardelia. "I've felt queer ever 
since the services. This mornin' I didn't know where the 



 

roller towel was, an' when Ellen told me, it looked 
strange." 

Here Ellen rose and, to her own despairing wonder, 
began to cry aloud, and Mary Neale got up and went 
to her. 

" There ! there ! '' she said. She put her hands on the 
girl's shoulders and seemed to hold her steady. Perhaps 
she would have drawn her to her warm breast, but Ellen 
stood like a young tree shaken, yet not to be uprooted, 
and cried into her hands spread desperately before her 
face. " You cry, Ellen," said Mary Neale, in her soft, 
kind voice, " Don't you try to keep it down. It'll do 
you good." 

" She ain't shed a tear," said Ardelia, in a pallid recog- 
nition of fact. " I dunno why she should cry about the 
roller towel." 

Mary knew. It had frightened Ellen to see her mother 
so different. It had almost frightened Mary to come in 
and find her so. 

" There," she said, taking her palms from Ellen's shoul- 
ders, with a last caressing pressure, " we needn't go back 
to the towel." 

" 'Twas the queerest thing that ever happened to me," 
said Ardelia, looking down at her hands in her lap, and 
seeming to be mildly interested in their movements, one 
over the other. " I come into the kitchen, an' Ellen was 
here buildin' the fire. I guess she got up 'fore day. 
Thinks I, * I'll put up a clean roller towel.' An' then I 
says to myself, ' Where is the roller? ' an' I looked round 
the kitchen an' couldn't see anything that looked like it, 
an' I says to Ellen, * Where's the roller? ' I says, an' she 
says, * There 'tis, same's it always is, behind the door.' 
An' she had to lead me up to it, an' then it didn't look 
right." 



 

Ellen, her tears staunched, was gazing at Mrs. Neale in 
an apprehensive challenging, as if she needed now to be 
told the worst. Mary gave her a smile and a reassuring 
nod. 

"You're worn out, Ardelia," she said. "That's all. 
It's enough, too. Didn't you know when anybody's in 
grief, their bodies get all worn out, and everything looks 
strange to 'em? I guess the whole world looks strange. 
Now you get to bed early — I won't stay long — 
and to-morrow morning maybe things'll look differ- 
ent." 

Ellen, clearing away, drew a long sobbing breath. She 
was grateful to Mary Neale for telling her other people 
had suffered just this mystery* of grief. The world was 
every minute more of an unfamiliar place to her. 

" Don't you go," said Ardelia. " I sha'n't get off to 
bed very early. It seems real good to have anybody come 
an' set a spell." 

Mary held her hands clasped tightly on her knee. She 
found she was drawing her breath with difficulty. There 
was a task before her. 

" Ardelia," said she, " I might as well say it now as any 
time. I've got something to ask you." 

"What is it?" returned Ardelia, from her state of 
numb acquiescence. 

Mary's hands gripped her knees the tighter. She 
opened her lips to speak, and what her tongue really said 
was so foreign to the words she had intended that she 
could have laughed with the grim humor of it. 

" I'm going to cut a ham to-morrow. I'll send you over 
two-three slices." And she had meant to ask: "Will 
you sell your house and lot? " 

Ardelia hardly woke from her numbness, but a slight 
warmth did appear in her voice. 


" Your hams are real, good," she said. " I guess El- 
len'd like a bite anyways."
