"She is not generally thought handsome," said Row 
land. 

" Evidently ! That 's the vulgarity of the human mind. 
Her head has great character, great natural style. If a 
woman is not to be a brilliant beauty in the regular way, 
she will choose, if she 's wise, to look like that. She will 
not be thought pretty by people in general, and desecrated, 
as she passes, by the stare of every vile wretch who chooses 
to thrust his nose under her bonnet ; but a certain number 
of intelligent people will find it one of the delightful things 
of life to look at her. That lot is as good as another ! 
Then she has a beautiful character !" 

"You found that out soon !" said Rowland, smiling. 

" How long did it take you ? I found it out before I 
ever spoke to her. I met her the other day in Saint 
Peter 's ; I knew it then. I knew it do you want to 
know how long I have known it ?" 

"Really," said Rowland, "I didn 't mean to cross- 
examine you." 

" Do you remember mamma 's ball in December ? We 
had some talk, and you then mentioned her not by name. 
You said but three words, but I saw you admired her, 
and I knew that if you admired her she must have a 
beautiful character. That 's what you require !" 

" Upon my word," cried Rowland, "you make three 
words go very far !" 



 

" Oh, Mr. Hudson has also spoken of her." 

" Ah, that 's better !" said Rowland. 

" I don 't know ; he doesn 't like her." 

"Did he tell you so?" The question left Rowland 's 
lips before he could stay it, which he would have done 
on a moment 's reflection. 

Christina looked at him intently. "No!" she said 
at last. " That would have been dishonourable, wouldn 't 
it ? But I know it from my knowledge of him. He 
doesn 't like perfection ; he is not bent upon being safe 
in his likings ; he is willing to risk something ! Poor 
fellow, he risks too much !" 

Rowland was silent ; he did not care for the thrust ; 
but he was profoundly mystified. Christina beckoned 
to her poodle, and the dog marched stiifly across to her. 
She gave a loving twist to his rose-coloured top-knot and 
bade him go and fetch her burnous. He obeyed, gathered 
it up in his teeth, and returned with great solemnity, 
dragging it along the floor. 

"I do her justice. I do her full justice," she went 
on, with soft earnestness. I like to say that, I like to 
be able to say it. She is full of intelligence and courage 
and devotion. She doesn 't do me a grain of justice ; but 
that is no harm. There is something so fine in the aver 
sions of a good woman ! " 

If you would give Miss Garland a chance, " said 
Rowland, " I am sure she would be glad to be your 
friend. " 

"What do you mean by a chance? She has only to 
take it. I told her I liked her immensely, and she 
frowned as if I had said something disgusting. She 
looks very handsome when she frowns." Christina rose 
with these words and began to gather her mantle about 
her. "I don 't often like women," she went on. "In 
fact I generally detest them. But I should like to know 
that one well. I should like to have a friendship with 
her ; I have never had one ; they must be very delightful. 


But I slia n't have one now not if she can help it ! Ask 
her what she thinks of me ; see what she will say. I 
don 't want to know ; keep it to yourself. It 's too sad. 
So we go through life. It 's fatality that 's what they 
call it, isn 't it ? We please the people we don 't care for, 
we displease those we do ! But I appreciate her, I do 
her justice ; that 's the most important thing. It 's be 
cause I have imagination. She has none. Never mind ; 
it 's her only fault. I do her justice ; I understand very 
well." She kept softly murmuring and looking about 
for Madame Grandoni. She saw the good lady near the 
door, and put out her hand to Rowland for good-night. 
She held his hand an instant, fixing him with her eyes, 
the living splendour of which at this moment was some 
thing transcendent. "Yes, I do her justice," she re 
peated. " And you do her more ; you would lay down 
your life for her." With this she turned away, and be 
fore he could answer she left him. She went to Madame 
Grandoni, grasped her two hands, and held out her fore 
head to be kissed. The next moment she was gone. 

"That was a happy accident !" said Madame Grandoni. 
" She never looked so beautiful, and she made my little 
party brilliant." 

"Beautiful verily!" Rowland answered. "But it 
was no accident." 

"What was it, then?" 

" It was a plan. She wished to see Mary Garland. 
She knew she was to be here." 

"How so?" 

" By Roderick evidently." 

"And why did she wish to see Mary Garland?" 

" Heaven knows ! I give it up ! " 

" Ah, the wicked girl !" murmured Madame Grandoni. 

"No, "said Rowland; " don 't say that now. She 's 
too beautiful." 

" Oh, you men the best of you !" 

"Well, then," cried Rowland, "she 's too good !" 





XX. 

THE opportunity presenting itself the next day, he failed 
not, as you may imagine, to ask Mary Garland what she 
thought of Christina. It was a Saturday afternoon, the 
time at which the beautiful marbles of the Villa Borghese 
are thrown open to the public. Mary had told him that 
Roderick had promised to take her to see them with his 
mother, and he joined the party in the splendid Casino. 
The warm weather had left so few strangers in Rome 
that they had the place almost to themselves. Mrs. 
Hudson had confessed to an invincible fear of treading, 
even with the help of her son 's arm, the polished marble 
floors, and was sitting patiently on a stool, with folded 
hands, looking shyly here and there at the undraped 
paganism around her. Roderick had sauntered off alone, 
with an irritated brow which seemed to betray the conflict 
between the instinct of observation and the perplexities 
of circumstance. His cousin was wandering in another 
direction, and though she was consulting her catalogue, 
Rowland fancied it was from habit ; she, too, was pre 
occupied. He joined her, and she presently sat down 
on a divan rather wearily and closed her Murray. Then 
he asked her abruptly how Christina had pleased her. 

She started the least bit at the question, and he felt 
that she had been thinking of Christina. 

" I don 't like her ! " she said, drily. 

" What do you think of her ? " 

"I think she 's false." This was said without petulance 
or bitterness, but with a very positive air. 

" But she wished to please you ; she tried," Rowland 
rejoined in a moment. 

" I think not. She wished to please herself!" 

Rowland felt himself at liberty to say no more. No 
allusion to Christina had passed between them since the 



 

day they met her at Saint Peter s, but he knew that she 
knew, by that infallible sixth sense of a woman who loves, 
that this strange and beautiful girl had the power to injure 
her. To what extent she had the will Mary was uncer 
tain ; but last night 's interview apparently had not re 
assured her. It was under these circumstances equally 
unbecoming for Rowland either to depreciate or to defend 
Christina, and he had to content himself with simply 
having verified the girl 's own assurance that she had 
made a bad impression. He tried to talk of indifferent 
matters about the statues and the frescoes ; but to-day 
plainly aesthetic curiosity, on his companion 's part, had 
folded its wings. Curiosity of another sort had taken 
its place. Mary was longing, he was sure, to question 
him about Christina ; but she found a dozen reasons for 
hesitating. Her questions would imply that Roderick 
had not treated her with confidence ; for information on 
this point should properly have come from himself. They 
would imply that she was jealous, and to betray her jea 
lousy was intolerable to her pride. For some minutes, as 
she sat scratching the brilliant pavement with the point of 
her umbrella, it was to be supposed that her pride and 
her anxiety held an earnest debate. At last anxiety won. 

" A propos of Miss Light," she asked, " do you know 
her well?" 

" I can hardly say that. But I have seen her re 
peatedly." 

" Do you like her ?" 

" Yes and no. I think I am sorry for her." 

Mary had spoken with her eyes on the pavement. At 
this she looked up. " Sorry for her ? Why ?" 

" Well she is unhappy. 

" What are her miseries ? 

" Well she has a horrible mother and she has had a 
most injurious education." 

For a moment Maiy was silent. Then, "Isn 't she 
very beautiful ?" she asked. 



 

" Don 't you think so ?" 

"That 's measured by what men think! She is ex 
tremely clever too." 

" Oh yes speaking as men think ! " 

"She has beautiful dresses." 

" Any number of them. " 

"And beautiful manners." 

" Yes sometimes." 

And plenty of money. " 

"Money enough apparently." 

"And she receives great admiration." 

"Very true." 

"And she is to marry a prince." 

" So they say." 

Mary rose and turned to rejoin her companions, com 
menting these admissions with a pregnant silence. " Poor 
Miss Light !" she said at last simply. And in this it 
seemed to Rowland there was a touch of serious mockery. 

Very late on the following evening his servant brought 
him the card of a visitor. He was surprised at a visit 
at such an hour, but it may be said that when he read 
the inscription Cavaliere Giuseppe Giacosa his sur 
prise abated. He had had an unformulated conviction 
that there was to be a sequel to the apparition at Madame 
Grandoni 's ; the Cavaliere had come to usher it in. 

He had come evidently on a portentous errand. He 
was as pale as ashes, and prodigiously serious ; his little 
cold black eye had grown ardent, and he had left his 
insinuating smile at home. He saluted Rowland, how 
ever, with his usual expressiveness. 

" You have more than once done me the honour to 
invite me to call upon you," he said. " I am ashamed of 
my long delay, and I can only say to you frankly that my 
time this winter has not been my own." Rowland as 
sented, ungrudgingly, fumbled for the Italian correlative 
of the adage " Better late than never," begged him to be 
seated, and offered him a cigar. The Cavaliere sniffed 



 

imperceptibly the fragrant weed, and then declared that 
if his kind host would allow him he would reserve it for 
consumption at another time. He apparently desired to 
intimate that the solemnity of his errand left him no 
breath for idle smoke-puffings. "I must confess," he 
observed, that even now I come on business not of my 
own or my own at least only in a secondary sense. I 
have been despatched as an ambassador an envoy extra 
ordinary, I may say by my dear friend, Mrs. Light." 

" If I can in any way be of service to Mrs. Light, I 
shall be happy," Rowland said. 

"Well then, dear sir, Casa Light is in commotion. 
The signora is in trouble in terrible trouble." For a 
moment Rowland expected to hear that the signora 's 
trouble was of a nature that a loan of five thousand francs 
would assuage. But the Cavaliere continued "Miss 
Light has committed a great crime ; she has plunged a 
dagger into the heart of her mother." 

"A dagger !" cried Rowland. 

The Cavaliere patted the air an instant with his finger 
tips. " I speak figuratively. She has broken off her 
marriage. " 

"Broken it off?" 

" Short ! She has turned the Prince from the door." 
And the Cavaliere, when he had made this announce 
ment, folded his arms and bent upon Rowland his intense 
inscrutable gaze. It seemed to Rowland that he detected 
in the polished depths of it a fantastic gleam of irony or 
of triumph ; but, superficially at least, Giacosa did nothing 
to discredit his character as a sympathetic representative 
of Mrs. Light 's affliction. 

Rowland heard his news with a kind of fierce disgust ; 
it seemed the sinister counterpart of Christina 's preter 
natural mildness at Madame Grandoni 's assembly. She 
had been too plausible to be honest. Without being 
able to trace the connection, he yet instinctively asso 
ciated her present rebellion with her meeting with Mary 



 

Garland. If she had not seen Mary, she would have let 
things stand. It was monstrous to suppose that she 
could have sacrificed so brilliant a fortune to a mere 
movement of jealousy, to a refined impulse of feminine 
devilry, to a desire to frighten poor Mary from her 
security by again appearing in the field. Yet Rowland 
remembered his first impression of her; she was "dan 
gerous," and she had measured in each direction the 
perturbing effect of her rupture. She was smiling her 
sweetest smile at it ! For half an hour Rowland simply 
detested her he longed to denounce her to her face. 
Of course, all he could say to Giacosa was that he was 
extremely sorry. " But I am not surprised," he added. 

"You are not surprised?" 

"With Miss Light everything is possible. Isn 't that 
true?" 

Another ripple seemed to play for an instant in the 
current of the old man 's irony, but he made no answer. 
"It was a magnificent marriage," he said at last. "I 
do not respect many people, but I respect Prince Casa- 
massima. " 

" I should judge him, indeed, to be a very honourable 
young man," said Rowland. 

Eh, young as he is, he is made of the old stuff. 
And now perhaps he 's blowing his brains out. He is 
the last of his house ; it 's a great house. But Miss 
Light will have put an end to it !" 

" Is that the view she takes of it ?" 

This time unmistakably the Cavaliere smiled, but still 
in that very out-of-the-way place. " You have observed 
Miss Light with attention," he said, "and this brings 
me to my errand. Mrs. Light has a high opinion of 
your wisdom, of your kindness, and she has reason to 
believe you have great influence with her daughter." 

" I with her daughter ? Not a grain ! " 

" That is possibly your modesty. Mrs. Light believes 
that something may yet be done, and that Christina will 



 

listen to you. She begs you to come and see her before 
it is too late." 

"But all this, my dear Cavaliere, is none of my busi 
ness," Rowland objected. "I can't possibly in such a 
matter take the responsibility of advising Miss Light. " 

The Cavaliere fixed his eyes for a moment on the 
floor, in brief but intense reflection. Then looking up, 
"Unfortunately," he said, "she has no man near her 
whom she respects ; she has no father !" 

"And such a finished fool of a mother!" Rowland 
gave himself the satisfaction of exclaiming. 

The Cavaliere was so pale that he could not easily 
have turned paler ; yet it seemed for a moment that his 
dead complexion blanched. "Eh, signore, such as she 
is, the mother appeals to you. A very handsome woman 
dishevelled, in tears, in despair, in dishabille ! " Row 
land reflected a moment, not on the attractions of Mrs. 
Light under the circumstances indicated by the Cavaliere, 
but on the satisfaction he should take in accusing Chris 
tina to her face of having struck a cruel blow. 

"I must add," said the Cavaliere, "that Mrs. Light 
desires also to speak to you on the subject of Mr. 
Hudson." 

"She considers Mr. Hudson connected with this step 
of her daughter s?" 

" Intimately. He must be got out of Rome." 

" Mrs. Light, then, must get an order from the Pope to 
remove him. It 's not in my power." 

The Cavaliere assented deferentially. "Mrs. Light 
is equally helpless. She would leave Rome to-morrow, 
but Christina would not budge. An order from the 
Pope would do nothing. A bull in council would do 
nothing." 

She is a remarkable young lady ! " said Rowland, 
with bitterness. 

But the Cavaliere rose and responded coldly, " She 
has a great spirit." And it seemed to Rowland that her 



 

great spirit, for mysterious reasons, gave him more plea 
sure than the distressing use she made of it gave him 
pain. He was on the point of charging him with his 
inconsistency, when Giacosa went on "But if the 
marriage can be saved, it must be saved. It 's a beauti 
ful marriage. It will be saved." 

"Notwithstanding Miss Light 's great spirit to the 
contrary?" 

"Miss Light, notwithstanding her great spirit, will 
call Prince Casamassima back." 

" Heaven grant it !" said Rowland. 

"I don 't know," said the Cavaliere, solemnly, "that 
Heaven will have much to do with it." 

Rowland gave him a questioning look, but he laid his 
finger on his lips. And with Rowland 's promise to 
present himself on the morrow at Casa Light, he shortly 
afterwards departed. He left Rowland revolving many 
things : Christina 's magnanimity, Christina 's perversity, 
Roderick 's contingent fortune, Mary Garland 's certain 
trouble, and the Cavaliere 's own fine ambiguities. 

Rowland 's promise to the Cavaliere obliged him to dis 
engage himself from an excursion which he had arranged 
with the two ladies from Northampton. Before going 
to Casa Light he repaired in person to Mrs. Hudson 's 
hotel to make his excuses. 

He found Roderick 's mother sitting with tearful eyes, 
staring at an open note that lay in her lap. At the 
window sat Mary Garland, who turned upon him as he 
came in a gaze both anxious and familiar. Mrs. Hudson 
quickly rose and came to him holding out the note. 

"In pity 's name, what is the matter with my boy? 
If he is ill, I entreat you to take me to him !" 

"He is not ill to my knowledge," said Rowland. 
"What have you there?" 

"A note a dreadful note. He tells us we are not 
to see him for a week. If I could only go to his room ! 
But I am afraid, I am afraid !" 



 

" I imagine there is no need of going to his room. 
What is the occasion, may I ask, of his note?" 

" He was to have gone with us on this drive to what 
is the place ? to Cervara. You know it was arranged 
yesterday morning. In the evening he was to have 
dined with us. But he never came, and this morning 
arrives this awful thing. Oh dear, I m so excited ! 
Would you mind reading it ?" 

Rowland took the note and glanced at its half-dozen 
lines. " I cannot go to Cervara," they ran ; "I have 
something else to do. This will occupy me perhaps a 
week, and you will not see me. Don 't miss me learn 
not to miss me. R. H." 

"Why, it means," Rowland explained, "that he has 
taken up a piece of work, and that it is all-absorbing. 
That 's very good news." This explanation was not 
sincere ; but he had not the courage not to offer it as a 
stop -gap. But he found he needed all his courage to 
support it, for Mary had left her place and approached 
him, formidably unsatisfied. 

" He does not work in the evening," said Mrs. Hudson. 
"Can't he come for five minutes? Why does he write 
such a cruel cold note to his poor mother to poor Maiy ? 
What have we done that he acts so strangely ? It 's this 
wicked, infectious, heathenish place !" And the poor 
lady 's suppressed mistrust of the Eternal City broke 
out passionately. " Oh, dear Mr. Mallet," she went 
on, "I am sure he has the fever, and he 's already 
delirious !" 

" I am very sure it 's not that," said Mary, softly. 

She was still looking at Rowland ; his eyes met hers 
and his own glance wandered away. This made him 
angry, and to carry off his confusion he pretended to be 
looking meditatively at the floor. After all, what had 
he to be ashamed of? For a moment he was on the 
point of making a clean breast of it, of crying out, 
"Good ladies, I abdicate ; I can't help you !" But he 



 

checked himself; he felt so impatient to have his three 
words with Christina. He grasped his hat. 

" I will see what it is !" he cried. And then he was 
glad he had not abdicated, for as he turned away he 
glanced again at Mary, and saw that, though her eyes 
were full of trouble, they were not hard and accusing, 
but charged with appealing friendship. 

He went straight to Roderick 's apartment, deeming 
this, at an early hour, the safest place to seek him. He 
found him in his sitting-room, which had been closely 
darkened to keep out the heat. The carpets and rugs 
had been removed, the floor of speckled concrete was 
bare, and lightly sprinkled with water. Here and 
there, over it, certain strongly-odorous flowers had been 
scattered. Roderick was lying on his divan in a white 
dressing-gown, staring up at the frescoed ceiling. The 
room was deliciously cool, and filled with the moist 
sweet fragrance of the circumjacent roses and violets. 
All this seemed highly fantastic, and yet Rowland hardly 
felt surprised. 

" Your mother was greatly alarmed at your note," he 
said, "and I came to satisfy myself that, as I believed, 
you are not ill." 

Roderick lay motionless except that he slightly turned 
his head towards his friend. He was smelling a large 
white rose, which he continued to present to his nose. 
In the darkness of the room he looked exceedingly pale, 
but his handsome eyes had an extraordinary brilliancy. 
He let them rest for some time on Rowland, lying there 
like a Bhuddist in an intellectual swoon, whose percep 
tion should be slowly ebbing back to temporal matters. 
"Oh, I am not ill," he said at last. "I have never 
been better." 

"Your note, nevertheless, and your absence have veiy 
naturally alarmed your mother. I advise you to go to 
her directly and reassure her." 

" Go to her ? Going to her would be worse than 



 

staying away. Staying away at present is a kindness." 
And he inhaled deeply his huge rose, looking up over it 
at Rowland. " My presence, in fact, would be indecent." 

" Indecent ? Pray explain." 

"Why, you see, as regards Mary Garland. I am 
divinely happy ! Doesn 't it strike you ? You ought to 
agree with me. You wish me to spare her feelings ; 
I spare them by staying away. Last night I heard 
something 

" I heard it too," said Rowland, with brevity. "And 
it 's in honour of this piece of news that you have taken 
to your bed in this fashion ?" 

" Extremes meet ! I can't get up for joy." 

"May I inquire how you heard your joyous news? 
from Miss Light herself?" 

"By no means. It was brought me by her maid, 
who is in my service as well." 

" Casamassima 's loss, then, is to a certainty your own 
gain?" 

"I don 't talk about certainties. I don 't want to be 
arrogant, I don 't want to offend the immortal gods. I 
am keeping very quiet, but I can't help being happy. I 
shall wait a while ; I shall bide my time." 

"And then?" 

"And then that incomparable girl will confess to me 
that when she threw overboard her Prince she remem 
bered that I adore her ! " 

" I feel bound to tell you," was in the course of a 
moment Rowland 's response to this speech, "that I am 
now on my way to Mrs. Light 's." 

"I congratulate you, I envy you!" Roderick mur 
mured, imperturbably. 

" Mrs. Light has sent for me to remonstrate -\vith her 
daughter, with whom she has taken it into her head that 
I have an influence. I don 't know to what extent I 
shall remonstrate, but I give you notice I shall not speak 
in your interest." 



 

Roderick looked at him for a moment with a lazy radi 
ance in his eyes. " Pray, don 't ! " he simply answered. 

You deserve I should tell her you are a very shabby 
fellow." 

"My dear Rowland, the comfort with you is that I 
can trust you. You are incapable of doing anything dis 
loyal." 

"You mean to lie here, then, smelling your roses and 
nursing your visions and leaving your mother and Miss 
Garland to eat their hearts out?" 

" Can I go and flaunt my felicity in their faces ? 
Wait till I get used to it a trifle. I have done them a 
villainous wrong, but I can at least forbear to add insult 
to injury. I may be an arrant fool, but for the moment I 
have taken it into my head to be prodigiously pleased. I 
shouldn 't be able to conceal it ; my pleasure would offend 
them ; so I lock myself up as a dangerous character. " 

"Well, I can only hope that your pleasure may never 
grow less or your danger greater !" 

Roderick closed his eyes again and sniffed at his rose. 
" God 's will be done !" 

On this Rowland left him and repaired directly to 
Mrs. Light 's. This afflicted lady hurried forward to 
meet him. Since the Cavaliere 's visit to Rowland she 
had taken a reef, as the saying is, in her distress, but 
she was evidently still in high agitation, and she clutched 
Rowland by his two hands as if in the shipwreck of her 
hopes he were her single floating spar. Rowland greatly 
pitied her, for there is something respectable in passion 
ate grief, even in a very bad cause ; and as pity is akin 
to love he felt rather more tolerant of her fantastic pre 
tensions than he had done hitherto. 

"Speak to her, plead with her, command her !" she 
cried, pressing and shaking his hands. "She ll not heed 
us, no more than if we were a pair of running fountains. 
Perhaps she will listen to you ; she always liked you." 

" She always disliked me," said Rowland. "But that
