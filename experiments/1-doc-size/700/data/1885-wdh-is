something. " Guess what Mr. Colville said, when I 
had been silly, and then tried to make up for it by 
being very dignified all of a sudden ? " 

" I don't know. How had you been silly ? " 

The servant brought in some cards. Imogene 




caught up the pelisse which she had been gradually 
shedding as she sat talking to Mrs. Bowen, and ran 
out of the room by another door. 

They did not recur to the subject. But that 
night, when Mrs. Bowen went to say good night to 
Effie, after the child had gone to bed, she lingered. 

" Effie," she said at last, in a husky whisper, 
" what did Imogene say to Mr. Colville to-day that 
made him laugh ? " 

"I don't know," said the child. "They kept 
laughing at so many things." 

" Laughing ? " 

" Yes ; he laughed. Do you mean toward the 
last, when he had been throwing stones into the 
river ? " 

" It must have been then." 

The child stretched herself drowsily. "Oh I 
couldn't understand it all. She wanted to throw a 
stone in the river, but he told her she had better 
not. But that didn't make him laugh. She was so 
very stiff just afterward that he said the weather 
had changed, and that made us laugh." 

" Was that all ? " 

" We kept laughing ever so long. I never saw 
any one like Mr. Colville. How queerly the fire 
shines on your face ! It gives you such a beautiful 
complexion." 

" Does it ? " 

" Yes, lovely." The child's mother stooped over 
and kissed her. " You 're the prettiest mamma in 
the world," she said, throwing her arm's round her 



 

neclc. " Sometimes I can't tell whether Imogene is 
prettier or not, but to-night I 'm certain you are. 
Do you like to have me think that *! " 

" Yes — yes. But don't pull me down so ; you 
hurt my neck. Good night." 

The child let her go. "I haven't said my prayer 
yet, mamma. I was thinking." 

"Well, say it now, then,'' said the mother gently. 

When the child had finished she turned upon her 
cheek. " Good night, mamma." 

Mrs. Bowen went about the room a little while, 
picking up its pretty disorder. Then she sat down 
in a chair by the hearth, where a log was still burn- 
ing. The light of the flame flickered upon her face, 
and threw upon the ceiling a writhing, fantastic 
shadow, the odious caricature of her gentle beauty. 



VIIL 

In that still air of the Florentine winter, time 
seems to share the arrest of the natural forces, the 
repose of the elements. The pale blue sky is fre- 
quently overcast, and it rains two days out of five ; 
sometimes, under extraordinary provocation from 
the north a snow-storm whirls along under the low 
grey dome, and whitens the brown roofs, wliere a 
growth of spindling weeds and grass clothes the 
tiles the whole year round, and shows its delicate 
green above the gathered flakes. But for the most 
part the winds are laid, and the sole change is from 
quiet sun to quiet shower. This at least is the im- 
pression which remains in the senses of the sojourn- 
ing stranger, whose days slip away with so little 
difference .one from another that they seem really 
not to have passed, but, like the grass that keeps the 
hillsides fresh round Florence all the winter long, 
to be waiting some decisive change of season before 
they begin. 

The first of the Carnival sights that marked the 
lapse of a month since his arrival took Colville by 
surprise. He could not have believed that it was 
H lis 



 

February yet if it had not been for the straggling 
maskers in armour whom he met one day in Via 
Borgognissanti, with their visors up for their better 
convenience in smoking. They were part of the 
chorus at one of the theatres, and they were going 
about to eke out their salaries with the gifts of people 
whose windows the festival season privileged them 
to play under. The silly spectacle stirred Colville's 
blood a little, as any sort of holiday preparation was 
apt to do. He thought that it afforded him a fair 
occasion to call at Palazzo Pinti, where he had not 
been so much of late as in the first days of his re- 
newed acquaintance with Mrs. Bowen. He had at 
one time had the fancy that Mrs. Bowen was cool 
toward him. He might very well have been mis- 
taken in this ; in fact, she had several times addressed 
him the politest reproaches for not coming, but he 
made some evasion, and went only on the days when 
she was receiving other people, and when necessarily 
he saw very little of the family. 

Miss Graham was always very friendly, but always 
very busy, drawing tea from the samovar, and look- 
ing after others. EflBe Bowen dropped her eyes in 
re-established strangeness when she brought the 
basket of cake to him. There was one moment 
when he suspected that he had been talked over in 
family council, and put under a certain regimen. 
But he had no proof of this, and it had really 
nothing to do with his keeping away, which was 
largely accidental. He had taken up, with as much 
earnestness as he could reasonably expect of himself, 



 

that notion of studying the architectural expression 
of Florentine character at the different periods. He 
had spent a good deal of money in books, he had re- 
vived his youthful familiarity with the city, and he 
had made what acquaintance he could with people 
interested in such matters. He met some of these 
in the limited but very active society in which he 
mingled daily and nightly. After the first strange- 
ness to any sort of social life had worn off, he found 
himself very fond of the prompt hospitalities which 
his introduction at Mrs. Bowen's had opened to him. 
His host — or more frequently it was his hostess — 
had sometimes merely an apartment at a hotel ; per- 
haps the family was established in one of the fur- 
nished lodgings which stretch the whole length of 
the Lung' Arno on either hand, and abound in all 
the new streets approaching the Cascine, and had 
set up the simple and facile housekeeping of the so- 
journer in Florence for a few months ; others had 
been living in the villa or the palace they had taken 
for years. 

The more recent and transitory people expressed 
something of the prevailing English and American 
sestheticism in the decoration of their apartments, 
but the greater part accepted the Florentine draw- 
ing-room as their landlord had imagined it for them, 
with furniture and curtains in yellow satin, a cheap 
ingrain carpet thinly covering the stone floor, and a 
fire of little logs ineffectually blazing on the hearth, 
and flickering on the carved frames of the pictures 
on the wall and the nakedness of the frescoed alle- 



 

gories in the ceiling. Whether of longer or shorter 
stay, the sojourners were bound together by a com- 
mon language and a common social tradition ; they 
all had a Day, and on that day there was tea and 
bread and butter for every comer. They had one 
another to dine ; there were evening parties, with 
dancing and without dancing. Colville even went 
to a fancy ball, where he was kept in countenance by 
several other Florentines of the period of Eomola. 
At all these places he met nearly the same people, 
whose alien life in the midst of the native com- 
munity struck him as one of the phases of modern 
civilisation worthy of note, if not particular study ; 
for he fancied it destined to a wider future through- 
out Europe, as the conditions in England and 
America grow more tiresome and more onerous. 
They seemed to see very little of Italian society, 
and to be shut out from practical knowledge of the 
local life by the terms upon which they had them- 
selves insisted. Our race finds its simplified and 
cheapened London or New York in all its Conti- 
nental resorts now, but nowhere has its taste been 
so much studied as in Italy, and especially in Flor- 
ence. It was not, perhaps, the real Englishman or 
American who had been considered, but a forestihe 
conventionalised from the Florentine's observation 
of many Anglo-Saxons. But he had been so well 
conjectured that he was hemmed round with a very 
fair illusion of his national circumstances. 

It was not that he had his English or American 
doctor to prescribe for him when sick, and his 



 

English or American apothecary to compound his 
potion ; it was not that there was an English tailor 
and an American dentist, an English bookseller and 
an English baker, and chapels of every shade of 
Protestantism, with Catholic preaching in English 
every Sunday. These things were more or less 
matters of necessity, but Colville objected that the 
barbers should offer him an American shampoo; 
that the groceries should abound in English biscuit 
and our own canned fruit and vegetables, and that 
the grocers' clerks should be ambitious to read the 
labels of the Boston baked beans. He heard — 
though he did not prove this by experiment — that 
the master of a certain trattoria had studied the 
doughnut of New England till he had actually sur- 
passed the original in the qualities that have under- 
mined our digestion as a people. But above all it 
interested him to see that intense expression of 
American civilisation, the horse-car, triumphing 
along the magnificent avenues that mark the line of 
the old city walls ; and he recognised an instinctive 
obedience to an abtruse natural law in the fact that 
whereas the omnibus, which the Italians have de- 
rived from the English, was not filled beyond its 
seating capacity, the horse-car was overcrowded 
without and within at Florence, just as it is with us 
who invented it. 

" I wouldn't mind even that," he said one day to 
the lady who was drawing him his fifth or sixth cup 
of tea for that afternoon, and with whom he was 
naturally making this absurd condition of things a 



 

matter of personal question ; " but you people here 
pass your days in a round of unbroken English, ex- 
cept when you talk with your servants. I 'm not 
sure you don't speak English with the shop people. 
I can hardly get them to speak Italian to me." 

" Perhaps they think you can speak English 
better," said the lady. 

This went over Florence ; in a week it was told 
to Colville as something said to some one else. He 
fearlessly reclaimed it as said to himself, and this 
again was told. In the houses where he visited he 
had the friendly acceptance of any intelligent and 
reasonably agreeable person who comes promptly 
and willingly when he is asked, and seems always to 
have enjoyed himself when he goes away. But 
besides this sort of general favour, he enjoyed a 
very pleasing little personal popularity which came 
from his interest in other people, from his good- 
nature, and from his inertness. He slighted no ac- 
quaintance, and talked to every one with the same 
apparent wish to be entertaining. This was because 
he was incapable of the cruelty of open indifference 
when his lot was cast with a dull person, and also 
because he was mentally too lazy to contrive pre- 
tences for getting away ; besides he did not really 
find anybody altogether a bore, and he had no wish 
to shine. He listened without shrinking to stories 
that he had heard before, and to things that had 
already been said to him ; as has been noted, he had 
himself the habit of repeating his ideas with the 
recklessness of maturity, for he had lived long 



 

enough to know that this can be done with almost 
entire safety. 

He haunted the studios a good deal, and through 
a retrospective affinity with art, and a human sym- 
pathy with the sacrifice which it always involves, he 
was on friendly terms with sculptors and painters 
who were not in every case so friendly with one 
another. More than once he saw the scars of old 
rivalries, and he might easily have been an adherent 
of two or three parties. But he tried to keep the 
freedom of the different camps without taking sides ; 
and he felt the pathos of the case when they all told 
the same story of the disaster which the taste for 
bric-a-brac had wrought to the cause of art; how 
people who came abroad no longer gave orders for 
statues and pictures, but spent their money on 
curtains and carpets, old chests and chairs, and pots 
and pans. There were some among these artists 
whom he had known twenty years before in Flor- 
ence, ardent and hopeful beginners; and now the 
backs of their grey or bald heads, as they talked to 
him with their faces towards their work, and a 
pencil or a pinch of clay held thoughtfully between 
their fingers, appealed to him as if he had remained 
young and prosperous, and they had gone forward 
to age and hard work. They were very quaint at 
times. They talked the American slang of the war 
days and of the days before the war; without a 
mastery of Italian, they often used the idioms of 
that tongue in their English speech. They were 
dim and vague about the country, with whose aifairs 



 

they had kept up through the newspapers. Here 
and there one thought he was going home very 
soon; others had finally relinquished all thoughts 
of return. These had, perhaps without knowing it, 
lost the desire to come back ; they cowered before 
the expensiveness of life in America, and doubted of 
a future with which, indeed, only the young can 
hopefidly grapple. But in spite of their accumu- 
lated years, and the evil times on which they had 
fallen, Colville thought them mostly very happy 
,men, leading simple and innocent lives in a world 
! of the ideal, and rich in the inexhaustible beauty of 
the city, the sky, the air. They all, whether they 
were ever going back or not, were fervent Americans, 
and their ineffaceable nationality marked them, 
perhaps, all the more strongly for the patches of 
something alien that overlaid it in places. They 
knew that he was or had been a newspaper man ; 
but if they secretly cherished the hope that he 
would bring them to the dolce lume of jDrint, they 
never betrayed it ; and the authorship of his letter 
about the American artists in Florence, which he 
printed in the American Register at Paris, was not 
traced to him for a whole week. 

Colville was a frequent visitor of Mr. "Waters, who 
had a lodging in Piazza San Marco, of the poverty 
which can always be decent in Italy. It was bare, 
but for the books that furnished it ; with a table for 
his writing, on a corner of which he breakfasted, a 
wide sofa with cushions in coarse white linen that 
frankly confessed itself a bed by night, and two 



 

chairs of plain Italian walnut ; but the windows, 
which had no sun, looked out upon the church and 
the convent sacred to the old Socinian for the sake 
of the meek, heroic mystic whom they keep alive in 
all the glory of his martyrdom. No two minds 
could well have been further apart than the New 
England minister and the Florentine nionk, and no 
two souls nearer together, as Colville recognised 
with a not irreverent smile. 

When the old man was not looking up some point 
of his saint's history in his books, he was taking 
with the hopefulness of youth and the patience of 
age a lesson in colloquial Italian from his land- 
lady's daughter, which he pronounced with a 
scholarly scrupulosity and a sincere atonic Massa- 
chusetts accent. He practised the language wher- 
ever he could, especially at the trattoria where he 
dined, and where he made occasions to detain the 
waiter in conversation. They humoured him, out 
of their national good-heartedness and sympathy, 
and they did what they could to realise a strange 
American dish for him on Sundays — a combination 
of stockfish and potatoes boiled, and then fried 
together in small cakes. They revered him as a 
foreign gentleman of saintly amiability and incom- 
prehensible preferences ; and he was held in equal 
regard at the next green-grocer's where he spent every 
morning five centessimi for a bunch of radishes and 
ten for a little pat of butter to eat with his bread and 
coffee ; he could not yet accustom himself to mere 
bread- and coffee for breakfast, though he conformed 



 

as completely as he could to the Italian way of living. 
He respected the abstemiousness of the race; he 
held that it came from a spirituality of nature to 
wliich the North was still strange, with all its con- 
science and sense of individual accountability. He 
contended that he never suffered in his small deal- 
ings with these people from the dishonesty which 
most of his countrymen complained of; and he 
praised their unfailing gentleness of manner; this 
could arise only from goodness of heart, which was 
perhaps the best kind of goodness after all. 

None of these humble acquaintance of his could 
well have accounted for the impression they all had 
that he was some sort of ecclesiastic. They could 
never have understood — nor, for that matter, could 
any one have understood through European tradi- 
tion — the sort of sacerdotal office that Mr. Waters 
had filled so long in the little deeply book-clubbed 
New England village where he had outlived most of 
his flock, till one day he rose in the midst of the sur- 
viving dyspeptics and consumptives and, following 
the example of Mr. Emerson, renounced his calling 
for ever. By that time even the pale Unitarianism 
thinning out into paler doubt was no longer tenable 
with him. He confessed that while he felt the 
Divine goodness more and more, he believed that it 
was a mistake to preach any specific creed or doctrine, 
and he begged them to release him from their ser- 
vice. A young man came to fill his place in their 
pulpit, but he kept his place in their hearts. They 
raised a subscription of seventeen hundred dollars 



 

and thirty-five cents; another being submitted to the 
new button manufacturer, who had founded his in- 
dustry in the village, he promptly rounded it out to 
three thousand, and Mr. Waters came to Florence. 
His people parted with him in terms of regret as 
delicate as they were awkward, and their love fol- 
lowed him. He corresponded regularly with two or 
three ladies, and his letters were sometimes read 
from his pulpit. 

Colville took the Piazza San Marco in on his way 
to Palazzo Pinti on the morning when he had made 
up his mind to go there, and he stood at the window 
looking out with the old man, when some more 
maskers passed through the place — two young fellows 
in old Florentine dress, with a third habited as a nun. 

"Ah," said the old man gently, "I wish they 
hadn't introduced the nun ! But I suppose they 
can't help signalising their escape from the domina- 
tion of the Church on all occasions. It 's a natural 
reaction. It will all come right in time." 

" You preach the true American gospel," said Col- 
ville. 

" Of course ; there is no other gospel. That is 
the gospel." 

" Do you suppose that Savonarola would think it 
had all come out right," asked Colville, a little mali- 
ciously, "if he could look from the window with us 
here and see the wicked old Carnival, that he tried 
so hard to kill four hundred years ago, still alive ? 
And kicking ?" he added, in cognisance of the caper 
of one of the maskers. 



 

" Oh yes ; why not ? By this time he knows that 
his puritanisra was all a mistake, unless as a thing 
for the moment only. I should rather like to have 
Savonarola here with us ; he would find these cos- 
tumes familiar ; they are of his time. I shall make 
a point of seeing all I can of the Carnival, as part of 
my study of Savonarola, if nothing else." 

" I 'm afraid you 'll have to give yourself limita- 
tions,'' said Colville, as one of the maskers threw his 
arm round the mock-nun's neck. But the old man 
did not see this, and Colville did not feel it necessary 
to explain himself. 

The maskers had passed out of the piazza now, and 
" Have you seen our friends at Palazzo Pinti lately ?" 
said Mr. Waters. 

"Not very,'' said Colville. "I was just on my 
way there." 

" I wish you would make them my compliments. 
Such a beautiful young creature." 

" Yes," said Colville ; " she is certainly a beautiful 
girl." 

" I meant Mrs. Bowen," returned the old man 
quietly. 

" Oh, I thought you meant Miss Graham. Mrs. 
Bowen is my contemporary, and so I didn't think of 
her when you said young. I should have called her 
pretty rather than beautiful." 

" No ; she 's beautiful. The young girl is good- 
looking — I don't deny that ; but she is very crude 
yet." 

Colville laughed. " Crude in looks ? I should 



 

have said Miss Graham was rather crude in mind, 
though I 'm not sure I wouldn't have stopped at say- 
ing young." 

" No," mildly persisted the old man; " she couldn't 
be crude in mind without being crude in looks." 

" You mean," pursued Colville, smiling, but not 
wholly satisfied, " that she hasn't a lovely nature ? " 

" You never can know what sort of nature a 
young girl has. Her nature depends so much upon 
that of the man whose fate she shares." 

" The woman is what the man makes her ? That 
is convenient for the woman, and relieves her of all 
responsibility." 

" The man is what the woman makes him, too, but 
not so much so. The man was cast into a deep sleep, 
you know " 

" And the woman was what he dreamed her. I 
wish she were." 

" In most cases she is," said Mr. Waters. 

They did not pursue the matter. The truth that 
floated in the old minister's words pleased Colville 
by its vagueness, and flattered the man in him by its 
implication of the man's superiority. He wanted to 
say that if Mrs. Bowen were what the late Mr. 
Bowen had dreamed her, then the late Mr. Bowen, 
when cast into his deep sleep, must have had Lina 
Eidgely in his eye. But this seemed to be person- 
alising the fantasy unwarrantably, and pushing it 
too far. For like reason he forbore to say that if 
Mr. Waters's theory were correct, it would be better 
to begin with some one whom nobody else had 



 

dreamed before ; then you could be sure at least of 
not having a wife to somebody else's mind rather 
than your own. Once on his way to Palazzo Pinti, 
he stopped, arrested by a thought that had not 
occurred to him before in relation to what Mr. 
Waters had been saying, and then pushed on with 
the sense of security which is the compensation the 
possession of the initiative brings to our sex along 
with many responsibilities. In the enjoyment of this, 
tio man stops to consider the other side, which must 
wait his initiative, however they mean to meet it. 

In the Tor San Maria Colville found masks and 
dominoes filling the shop windows and dangling 
from the doors. A devil in red and a clown in 
white crossed the way in front of him from an in- 
tersecting street; several children in pretty mas- 
querading dresses flashed in and out among the 
crowd. He hurried to the Lung' Arno, and reached 
the palace where Mrs. Bowen lived, with these holi- 
day sights fresh in his mind. Imogene turned to meet 
him at the door of the apartment, running from the 
window where she had left Effie Bowen still gazing. 

"We saw you, coming,'' she said gaily, without 
waiting to exchange formal greetings. " We didn't 
know at first but it might be somebody else dis- 
guised as you. We 've been watching the maskers 
go by. Isn't it exciting ? " 

"Awfully," said Colville, going to the window 
with her, and putting his arm on EfSe's shoulder, 
where she knelt in a chair looking out. "What 
have you seen ? " 



 

"OJt, only two Spanish students with mandolins," 
said Imogene ; " but you can see they 're beginning 
to come." 

" They 'II stop now," murmured Effie, with gentle 
disappointment ; " it 's commencing to rain." 

" Oh, too bad ! " wailed the young girl. But just 
then two mediaeval men-at-arms came in sight, carry- 
ing umbrellas. "Isn't that too delicious? Um- 
brellas and chain-armour ! " 

" You can't expect them to let their chain-armour 
get rusty," said Colville. " You ought to have been 
with me — minstrels in scale-armour, Florentines of 
Savonarola's times, nuns, clowns, demons, fairies — 
no end to them." 

" It 's very well saying we ought to have been 
with you ; but we can't go anywhere alone." 

" I didn't say alone," said Colville. " Don't you 
think Mrs. Bowen would trust you with me to see 
these Carnival beginnings ? " He had not meant at 
all to do anything of this kind, but that had not 
prevented his doing it. 

" How do we know, when she hasn't been asked ?" 
said Imogene, with a touch of burlesque dolor, such 
as makes a dignified girl enchanting, when she per- 
mits it to herself. She took Effie's hand in hers, the 
child having faced round from the window, and 
stood smoothing it, with her lovely head patheti- 
cally tilted on one side. 

" What haven't I been asked yet ? " demanded 
Mrs. Bowen, coming lightly toward them from a 
door at the side of the salon. She gave her hand 



 

to Colville with the prettiest grace, and a cordiality 
that brought a flush to her cheek. There had really- 
been nothing between them but a little unreasoned 
coolness, if it were even so much as that ; say 
rather a dryness, aggravated by time and absence, 
and now, as friends do, after a thing of that kind, 
they were suddenly glad to be good to each other. 

"Why, you haven't been asked how you have 
been this long time,'' said Colville. 

"I have been wanting to tell you for a whole 
week," returned Mrs. Bowen, seating the rest and 
taking a chair for herself. " Where have you 
been ? " 

" Oh, shut up in my cell at Hotel d'Atene, writing 
a short history of the Florentine people for Miss 
Effie." 

" Effie, take Mr. Colville's hat," said her mother. 
" We 're going to make you stay to lunch," she ex- 
plained to him. 

" Is that so ? " he asked, with an effect of polite 
curiosity. 

"Yes." Imogene softly clapped her hands, un- 
seen by Mrs. Bowen, for Colville's instruction that 
all was going well. If it delights women to pet an 
undangerous friend of our sex, to use him like one 
of themselves, there are no words to paint the soft 
and flattered content with which his spirit purrs 
under their caresses. "You must have nearly 
finished the history,'' added Mrs. Bowen. 

"Well, I could have finished it," said Colville, 
" if I had only begun it. You see, writing a short
