" You're a girl, I suppose, and don't understand things," said her companion. "Boys 
know what a Brick is when they see it." 

Why, so do I," said Matilda, don't I ? " 

But the boy only laughed, and then asked 
Matilda where she lived, and if she had any 
brothers, and where she went to school. 

" I go to the other school, you see," said 
he ; " that's how I've never seen you before. 
I wish you went to my school ; and I'd give 
you a ride on my sled." 



 

"But you'll come to our Sunday school, 
won't you ? " Matilda asked. 

" To be sure I will ; but you see, I can't take 
you on my sled on Sunday. They'd have all 
the ministers out after me." 

" O, no ! " said Matilda. " I was not thinking of the sled ; but you are very kind." 

" I should like it," said the boy. " Yes, I 
am coming to the school though I guess 
I've got an old fogy of a teacher. But the 
minister's a Brick isn't he ? " 

" He isn't much like me" said Matilda 
laughing. " And the sort of bricks that I 
know, one is very much like another." 

The boy laughed too, and asked if she 
didn't want to know his name? Matilda 
glanced again at the frank face and nice dress, 
and said yes. 

" My name's Norton Laval. What's 
yours ? " 

" Matilda Englefield. I am going this 
way." 

" Yes, you go that way and I go this way , 




but we shall see each other again. Good 
bye." 

So at the corner they parted ; and Matilda 
went home, thinking that in this instance at 
least the welcoming of strangers had paid well. 
For this was a pleasant new acquaintance, 
she was sure. She mounted the stairs with 
happy feet to her room ; and there found 
Maria in a flood of tears. Maria had staid 
at home from Sunday school to-day. 

"What is the matter, Maria?" her little 
sister inquired. " How's mamma ? " 

" I don't know ! O, nothing will ever be 
well again! O Tilly, what will become of 
us!" 

And here a storm of sobs and tears came 
on, in the midst of which Matilda's questions 
could get no attention. Matilda knew her 
sister, however, and waited. 

O Tilly it's so dreadful ! " 

" What ? " said Matilda calmly. 

" We haven't got anything to live upon. 
Anne and Letty have been telling me. We 



haven't. We are going to be as poor as as 
poor as anybody. We have got nothing to 
buy anything with nothing at all! Anne 
says so." 

" Did mamma say so ? " 

" Mother's sick. No, aunt Candy told the 
girls. It's true. Somebody or something 
that had mamma's money to take care of 
has gone off, or been ruined, or something; 
and we are ruined! There is nothing left at 
all for us to live upon. And that is what has 
been troubling mamma all these weeks ; and 
now it is certain and she knows all about it; 
and I guess it is that has made her sick. O, 
what shall we do ? " 

The turn of Matilda's head was inimitable 
and indescribable. It was not arrogance or 
affectation ; it was perfectly natural to the 
child ; but to a bystander it would have signified that she was aware Maria's views and 
statements were not to be relied upon and 
could not be made the basis of either opinion 
or action. She took off her things, and with- 



 

out another word made her way to the room 
of her elder sisters. They were both sitting 
there gloomily. 

" How is mamma ? " 

" I don't know. I haven't seen her since 
dinner." 

It was with a little of the same half graceful, half competent gesture of the head that 
Matilda applied herself to Letitia. 

" What is all this story, Letty, that Maria 
has been telling me ? " 

" How should I know ? Maria tells a great 
many stories." 

" I mean, about what has been troubling 
mamma." 

" Maria had no business to tell you, and so 
trouble you with it." 

" But is it true, Letty ? Anne, is it true ? " 

" I suppose it is true if you mean what 
she heard from me a little while ago. That 
is true." 

" And mamma has lost all her monev ? " 

" Every cent." 



 

" When did you know it, Anne and 
Letty ? " 

" We have known it a day or two. It is 
true. It is all true, Tilly." 

" What is mamma going to do, then ? " 

" Get well, I hope. That is the first thing. 
Aunt Candy says she will pay for her board 
and Clarissa's, and mamma and you can live 
on that. Letty and I must go get our living 
somehow." 

And here Anne broke down. Matilda 
wanted to ask about Maria's fate in the general falling to pieces of the family ; but her 
throat felt so full, she was afraid she could 
not. So she did not try ; she turned and 
went downstairs to her mother. 

Mrs. Englefield was dozing, flushed and 
uneasy ; she hardly noticed who was with her, 
but asked for water, and then for cologne 
water. Matilda brought the one and the 
other, and sat by the bedside wiping her 
mother's brow and cheeks with the cologne. 
Nobody came to interrupt or relieve her for 



 

some time. The light of the afternoon began 
to fade and the sunbeams came aslant from, 
the western sky ; and still the child sat there 
passing the handkerchief gently over her 
mother's face. And while she sat so, Matilda 
was thinking what possible ways there might 
be by which she could make money. 

" Tilly, is that you ? " said Mrs. Englefield 
faintly as the sunbeams were just quitting the 
room. 

" Yes, mamma. Are you better? " 

" Is there no one else here ? " 

" No, mamma. Aunt Candy is out ; and 
I suppose the girls thought you were sleeping. 
Are you better, mamma? You have had a 
nice long nap." 

" It's been horrid ! " said Mrs. Englefield. 
" I have dreamed of every possible dreadful 
thing." 

" But you feel better now ? " 

" My head aches no O my head ! 
Tilly" 

What, mamma ? " 



 

"I am going to be sick. I sha'n't be about 
again for a while, I know. I want you to do 
just what I tell you." 

" Yes, mamma. What ? " 

" Anne and Letty are going away." 

" Yes, mamma. I know." 

" Do you know why, dear?" 

The tone of tender, sorrowful sympathy in 
which this was said, overcame the child. As 
her mother's eyes with the question languidly 
sought her face, Matilda burst into tears and 
threw herself upon her neck. 

No, don't," said Mrs. Englefield faintly, 
I can't bear it. Don't, Matilda ! Rise up 
and listen to me." 

Matilda did as she was told. She forced 
back her tears ; stopped her sobs ; dashed 
away the drops from the corners of her eyes ; 
and sat up again to hear what her mother had 
to say to her. 

"Give rne some more water first. Anne 
and Letty are going away, Tilly ; and I can- 
not be up and see to anything ; and I can't 



 

hire a woman to do what's to be done. You 
tell Maria, from me, she must stay home from 
school and take care of the house. You will 
do what you can, Tilly oh, my head ! you 
can put rooms in order and such things ; and 
Maria must go down into the kitchen and get 
the breakfast " 

" Must Maria get the dinner too, mamma ? " 

" Yes, the dinner " 

" But can she, mamma ? " 

" She must ; or else your aunt Candy will 
hire somebody to do it ; and that will come 
out of what she pays me, and we shall not 
have enough left. She must, Tilly." 

" But aunt Candy wouldn't mind, just while 
you are sick, mamma, would she?" 

" Yes ! I know. Just you do as I tell you ; 
promise me that you will." 

" I will, mamma." 

" Promise me that Maria will." 

" I guess she will, mamma. I'll try and make 
her. Shall I bring her here, and you tell her 
yourself ? " 




" No, indeed. Don't bring Maria here. 
She would make such a row she would kill 
me. Anne and Letty will see to things, till 
they go O, I can't talk any longer. Give 
me some more water." 

She was presently dozing again ; and Ma- 
tilda, clasping her small hands, sat and 
thought over what was before her. It began 
to feel like a weight on her somewhere on 
her shoulders, she thought, and lying on her 
heart too ; and the longer she thought about 
it, the heavier and harder it pressed. The 
family to be broken up; her mother to be 
straitened for money ; Matilda did not know 
very well what that meant, but it sounded 
disagreeable; her aunt suddenly presented in 
new and not pleasant colours ; a general threatening cloud overshadowing all the future. Matilda began to get, what her strong little 
heart was not accustomed to, a feeling of real 
discouragement. What could she do ? And 
then a word of the afternoon's lesson in the 
Sunday school came freshly to mind. It had 



 

Deen quite new to Matilda, and had seemed 
to her very beautiful ; but it took on quite another sort of beauty now, " Cast thy burden 
upon the Lord ; he shall sustain thee." 

Will he ? " thought Matilda. " Can he ? 
May I tell him about all this? and will he 
help me to bear it, and help me to do all that 
work, and to make Maria do hers ? But he 
will, for he has said so" 

It was getting dusk in the room. Matilda 
knelt down by her chair, and poured out all 
her troubles into the ear that would heed and 
could help her. 

" Who's here ? " said the voice of Mrs. 
Candy coming in. " Who is that ? Matilda ? How did you come here, Tilly ? " 

" I have been taking care of my mother." 

" Have you ? How is she ? Well, you run 
downstairs I'll take care of her now. It 
is better for you not to be here. Don't come 
in again, unless I give you leave. Now you 
may go." 

"I wonder, must I mind her?" said Ma- 



 

tilda to herself. " I do not see why. She 
is not mother; and if mother is sick, that 
does not give everybody else a right to 
say what I shall do. I think it is very 
queer of aunt Candy to take that way with 
me." 

And I am afraid Matilda's head was carried a little with the air which was, to be 
sure, natural to her, and not unpretty, and 
yet which spoke of a good deal of conscious 
competency. It is no more than justice to 
Matilda to say that she did not ever put the 
feeling into any ill-mannerly form. It hardly 
appeared at all, except in this turn of her head, 
which all her own family knew, laughed at, 
admired, and even loved. So she went down 
stairs to the parlour. 

" How is aunt Marianne ? " was the question from Clarissa. " Letty told me where 
you were. But little one, it is not good for 
you to go into your mother's sick room ; you 
can do nothing, and you are better out. 
So mamma wishes you not to go in there 



 

till aunt Marianne is better you understand?" 

" Clarissa too ! " thought Matilda to herself. 
But she made no answer. She came by the 
fire to warm herself; for her mother's room 
had been cold. 

" You shouldn't go so near the fire ; you'll 
burn your dress," Clarissa remarked. 

" No," said Matilda ; and she said but that 
one word. 

" You will take the colour out, if you do 
not set it on fire ; and that is what I meant. 
That is your best dress, Tilly." 

It was true ; and sorely against her will 
Matilda stepped a little back. 

" You were a great while at Sunday school 
to-day," Clarissa went on. 

" No," said Matilda ; " not longer than 
usual." 

" What do you learn there ? " 

" Why, cousin Issa, what do you teach at 
your Sunday school ? " said Matilda. For 
Clarissa had sheered off from Mr. Richmond's 



church, and gone into a neighbouring one 
which belonged to the denomination in which 
she had been brought up. 

" That is not good manners, to answer one 
question with another, little one." 

" I thought one answer might serve for 
both," said Matilda. 

" I am afraid it would not. For in my Sunday school I teach the catechism." 

" Don't the catechism tell about Jesus ? " 

" Some things, of course." 

" Our lessons tell all things about him," 
said Matilda ; " and that is what I learn." 

" Do you learn about yourself ? " 

What about myself? " 

" How you ought to behave, and how you 
ought not to behave." 

" Why, I think learning about Jesus teaches 
one that" said Matilda. 

" I think there is nothing so good as coming home to learn about home," said Clarissa. 

The talk did not run in a way to please 
Matilda, and she was silent. Presently they 




were called down to tea. Everybody suffering from a fit of taciturnity. 

" Maria, sit up straight," said Mrs. Candy. 

" I always sit so," was the answer. 

" So, is not very graceful. Matilda does not 
sit so." 

" Matilda was always straight it's her 
way," said Maria. 

" Well make it your way too. Come ! 
Straighten up. What shoulders ! One would 
think you were a boy playing at leap-frog." 

"I don't know what 'leap-frog' is," said 
Maria colouring ; " and I don't think anybody 
would think I was anything but a girl anyhow. I get tired sitting up straight." 

When ? " asked Clarissa. 

Matilda's head was quite indescribable in 
the turn it gave at this moment. Her supper 
was done ; she was leaving the table. 

" You are not going into your mother's 
room ? " said her aunt, catching her hand as 
she passed. 

" You said you wished I would not." 




" Yes, my dear. I am going up there immediately. Don't go out either, Matilda." 

" I am going to church, aunt Candy." 

" I think not. Not to-night. I do not ap- 
prove of so much church going for little girls. 
You can study your lesson, you know, for 
next Sunday. I do not want to have anybody else sick on my hands till your mother 
is well." 

Matilda's face expressed none of her disappointment ; her head was even carried a little 
higher than usual as she left the room. But 
outside the door her steps flagged ; and she 
went slowly up the stairs, asking herself if she 
wa? bound to mind what her aunt said. She. 
was not clear about it. In the abstract, Matilda was well enough disposed to obey all 
lawful authority; just now a spirit of opposition had risen. Was this lawful authority? 
Mrs. Englefield was sick, to be sure ; but did 
that give Mrs. Candy any right to interfere 
with what was known to be Mrs. Englefield's 
will when she was not sick, Matilda thought 




not. Then, on the other hand, she did not 
wish to do anything to displease her aunt, 
who had always been kind to her; she did not 
wish to change the relations between them. 
Slowly Matilda mounted stair after stair till 
she got to her room. There she stood by the 
window a moment, thinking and sorrowing ; 
for if she did not wish to anger her aunt, 
neither did she wish to lose her evening in 
church, her sight of Mr. Richmond, and his 
sermon. And just then, the clear sweet sound 
of the church bell came, with its first note, to 
tell that the service would begin in a quarter 
of an hour. It sounded like a friend's voice 
calling her. Her aunt Candy's church bell 
joined in, and Mr. Everett's church, and Mr. 
Schonflocker's church ; but that one which 
Mr. Ulshoeffer rang was the loudest of all to 
Matilda's ear. She could hardly stand it. 
Then Maria burst in. 

" "What are you going to do?" said Matilda. 

" Do ? Why, I am going to church, of 
course ; and in a hurry." 



 

And Anne and Letty ? " 
" Certainly ; and Issa too." 
Matilda said no more, but hastily made her 
self ready, and went down with the rest. 



CHAPTER IX. 

ANNE and Letitia were to leave home in 
the afternoon of Monday; and Maria 
and Matilda went to school that morning as 
usual. But when the noon hour came, Matilda called her sister into a corner of the emptied schoolroom, and sat down with a face of 
business. 

" What is the matter? " said Maria. " We 
must go home to dinner." 

" I should like to speak to you here first." 

" About what ? Say it and be quick ; for 
I am ever so hungry. Aunt Candy cut my 
breakfast short this morning." 

" I wanted to say to you, that we had better take home our books." 

"What for?" said Maria with opening 
eyes. 




" Because, Maria, mamma was talking to 
me last night about it. You know there will 
be no one at home now, after to-day, but you 
and me." 

" Aunt Erminia and Clarissa ? " 

" Nobody to do anything, I mean." 

" Can't they do anything? I don't know 
what you are talking of, Matilda; but I know 
I want my dinner." 

" Who do you think will get dinner to- 
morrow ? " 

" Well mother's sick of course ; and Anne 
and Letty are going. I should think aunt 
Candy might." 

" No, she won't." 

" How do you know ? " 

" Because mother said so. She won't do 
anything." 

" Then she'll have to get a girl to do things, 
I suppose." 

" But Maria, that is just what mother wants 
she shouldn't do ; because she'd have to pay 
for it." 



 

" Who would have to pay for it?" 

" Mamma." 

" Why would she ? " 

" She said so." 

" I don't see why she would, I am sure. 
If aunt Erminia hires a girl, she'll pay for 
her." 

" But that will come out of what aunt Erminia pays to mamma ; and what aunt 
Erminia pays to mamma is what we have got 
to live upon." 

"Who said so?" 

" Mamma said so." Matilda answered with 
her lip trembling; for the bringing facts all 
down to hard detail, was difficult to bear. 

Well I do think," exclaimed Maria, " if I 
had a sister sick and not able to help herself, 
I would not be so mean ! " 

Matilda sat still and cried and said noth- 
ing. 

" Who is going to do all the work then, 
Tilly ? " 

There would have been something comical, 



 

if it had not been sad, in the way the little 
girl looked up and said, " You and I." 

" I guess we will!" said Maria with open- 
ing eyes. " You and I ! Take care of the 
house, and wash the dishes, and cook the din- 
ner, and everything! You know we couldn't, 
Matilda; and what's more, 7 know we 
won't." 

" Yes, mamma wishes it. We must ; and 
so we can, Maria." 

" I can't," said Maria, taking down her 
school cloak. 

" But Maria ! we must. Marnma will be 
more sick if we do not ; you heard what aunt 
Candy said at breakfast, that she is fearfully 
nervous; and if she hears that there is a 
hired girl in the house, it will worry her dread- 
fully." 

" It will be aunt Candy's fault then," said 
Maria, fastening her cloak. " I never heard 
of anybody so mean in all my life! never." 

" But that don't help anything, Maria. 
And you and I must do what mamma said. 



You know we shall have little enough to 
live on, as it is, and if you take the pay of 
a hired girl out of it, there will be so little 
left." 

" I've got my twenty-five dollars, that I can 
get summer dresses with ; I am glad I haven't 
spent it," said Maria. " Corne, Tilly ; I'm 
going home." 

" But Maria, you have not said what you 
ought to say yet." 

What ought I to say ? " 

" I will help and do my part. We can 
manage it. Come, Maria, say that you 
will."
