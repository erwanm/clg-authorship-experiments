it will be comparatively easy for you, but it won't 
really be worth your while to come back to spite 
me." 

"I shall come back," said Ralph, "because I 
shall want to." 

She had another of those weighted headshakes 
which, as if determined less from within than 
from without, suggested the perfect working of her 
beauty rather than that of her thought. "No V 
it's there that you're wrong and that I'm so right. 





 

I'm not such an idiot as not to know that there 
will always be a steamer and that you can always 
pay your passage. When I said that if you go 
you'll never come back I meant that you'll never 
wish to. Of course you can come back without 
wishing as much as you like. But that," she 
blandly remarked, "won't do for me." 

"How well you know what I wish," he exhaled, 
"and how much every way you know about 
everything ! " 

"Well," she patiently replied before he had 
time finally to leave her, "it's not wholly my 
fault if an expression you once used to me has 
much worked in me. I remembered it as soon 
as I saw you to-day, and it would have made a 
folly of my talking to you of my conditions if 
I had done that with any other practical view 
than to call your attention to our impossibilities. 
You used it on one occasion when I was last at 
home in a way that has made me never forget 
it." 

Ralph wondered. "I've used doubtless plenty 
of expressions and in plenty of absurd ways. But 
what in the world was this one ? " 

She brought it responsibly out. " 'The sense 
of the past '." 

He wondered still more. "Is that all?" 

"You said it was the thing in life you desired 
most to arrive at, and that wherever you had 
found it even where it was supposed to be most 





  

vivid and inspired it had struck you as deplor 
ably lacking intensity. At the intensity required, 
as you said, by any proper respect for itself, 
you proposed if possible yourself to arrive art,  
research, curiosity, passion, the historic passion, 
as you called it, helping you. From that mo 
ment," she went on, "I saw. The sense of the 
past is your sense." 

He attended with a cold eye. "I haven't an 
idea what trash I may have talked." 

"Don't be dishonest," she returned after a 
moment. 

It brought, almost as a blow, a flush to his 
cheek. " Dishonest ? " 

"Don't deny yourself. Don't deny your am 
bition. Don't deny your genius." 

He looked at her over it strangely, and then 
as if light had really br&ken, "Are those things 
what you hate me for?" he almost gasped. 

"Live up to them," she returned as if she had 
not heard him. "You won't do anything else." 
She said it with a shortness that was almost 
stern, and he felt, detestably, as if she had but 
one moment instructed and at the other derided 
him. "Isn't that moreover quite the lesson of 
the chance, the one you just mentioned, of what 
you may come in for? Isn't an old property for
you the very finger of fortune, the very  lead  of 
providence ? Profit for heaven's sake by your 
old property. It will open your eyes." She went 





  

on with widened looks which so further ennobled 
her face that they held him by themselves, stand 
ing out as he did from any truth in them. "That's 
what your little book itself says your little book 
that's so wonderful for a man uninitiated; by 
which I venture to mean, you see, a man un- 
travelled. It's apropos of what you call the 
'backward vision,' and I could immediately find 
the page. 'There are particular places where 
things have happened, places enclosed and or 
dered and subject to the continuity of life mostly, 
that seem to put us into communication, and 
the spell is sometimes made to work by the im 
position of hands, if it be patient enough, on an 
old object or an old surface.' It's very wonderful, 
you know, your having arrived at that, your 
having guessed it, in this place, which denies the 
old at every turn and contains so few such ob 
jects or surfaces." So she continued to comment.' 
"I hope your old house will contain plenty of 
them." 

Her quotation of this twaddle, as it struck 
him, from his small uninformed Essay, for which 
he now blushed, completed his disarray. Half a 
dozen things rose to his lips and stopped, but 
the bitterest got uttered. "What's most extraor 
dinary is that illusion I was under about your 
own type. I had taken it," he explained, "as 
so beautifully suggestive." 

"Suggestive of what?" his hostess asked. 




  

He looked at her without meeting this and as 
for the last time. "And again it's all there. You 
would help me more than anyone. I feel it," he 
continued with his eyes on her face, "really not as a 
mistake. Essentially well, you're one of them." 

"One of whom?" 

"The women. The women. Good-bye," he 
said again and offering his hand as if their queer 
chasm had been bridged by this intensity of the 
personal question. It was as if he took some 
thing that she couldn't help giving, and what he 
took made him after an instant break out: "It 
will be you I'll be hanged ! who will come." 

But she was so firm and finished and high 
withal that even the ring of perception in this, 
or at least the rush of confidence, failed to make 
her wince. It only made her think to the very 
end of her goodnature. "I'll tell you what I'll 
do if I can trust to your honour." 

"You can trust to my honour," Pendrel said. 

"Very well then, I promise you that if I find 
I want to for that's the point I'll loyally, 
bravely, and at whatever cost this time to my 
vanity, go back." 

Pendrel weighed it. "Isn't there a danger 
that you'll take care not to find you want 
to?" " 

"Certainly a danger. I can do anything rather 
than want to. Anything, that is I again promise 
you short of marrying to save myself. It will 





take a miracle to move me, but if I am moved 
moved from within and by something now in 
calculable you may count on me. That," Au 
rora said, "is the meaning of my talking of my 
honour." 

"And what's the meaning," Ralph asked, "of 
your talking of mine ?" 

"Why, that I take in the same way my chance 
of yours." She paused he must understand. 

This took him indeed no great time. "You'll 
have me if I do come?" 

She hesitated again but an instant. "If you 

come on your honour. If you come !" But 

it was as if she couldn't put it. 

He tried to help her. "Without regret ?" 

Ah this wasn't good enough. "If you come 
with desire." 

Ralph stared. "How in the world can I come 
without it if I come for you ?" 

She used again her large ease. "That won't 
help you if you're loyal." 

"Loyal?" he wondered. 

"To the real truth. To your genius." 

"Oh I'll take care of my genius!" 

"You will," she presently returned, "if you 
remember well this: that if you do rejoin me you 
engage to me to stay." 

"Very good I shall remember it well." 

"Good-bye then," said Aurora Coyne. 

She saw him to the door, where he paused for 




  

a last light. "Does that mean you hold you're 
safe?" 

"It means that I hold you are," she answered 
as she turned away.. 







BOOK SECOND 

IT was not till he reached the street that he took 
in all she meant as in particular by those last 
words. Without sense or sight, on leaving the 
house, he turned mechanically to the left and 
went blankly before him. This was not his way 
home, but he had no thought for ways. He 
moved simply because if he didn't there was 
nothing for him but to sit down on the first other 
doorstep. He felt mainly a great weakness felt 
almost nothing else; yet it was a weakness that, 
oddly, sustained him for a long stretch, carried 
him up to the Park, determined his passing in, 
and then made him proceed unheedingly from the 
nearer to the further end. It was only on reach 
ing the distant limit that he so much as noted 
a bench. The one he noted, however, he quickly 
sank upon; and little by little, thereafter, he 
gained a second consciousness. This was a per 
ception of the beauty of the day, the mildest 
mood of March. The windless air, charged with 
spring, was like a brimming cup held still. The 
weather was divine, but the person supposed by 
him an hour before as dear to him as life had 
since then turned him out into the world. Well, 
the world was there to take him. Yes, he in- 





  

creasingly felt, he was there and his bench, placed 
near the top of the spread of a great alley, seemed 
to give him a general view of it. The object in 
deed after a while most distinct in this view was 
Ralph Pendrel himself, who rose there conspicuous 
and held our young friend's eyes. What marked 
him most was that he was a man humiliated. 
Arrange it as he would or as she would he 
had not been good enough. What it really came 
to she might say what she liked was that he 
was not of the type. Who was then ? he could 
but put himself the question. He even presently 
reflected that it might serve her right to find after 
a while there was nobody. Thus it was that 
Ralph Pendrel, with the world taking him, was 
yet thrown back on that gentleman. If he was 
not good enough for her he would be so for this 
alternative friend; and he gathered about him 
in thought for an hour all the merits he could 
muster. One of them precisely was that he had 
another and quite a different passion. He kept 
repeating to himself that just this, for his hard 
mistress, was his defect. He had wondered much 
before he got up whether he had it with such 
intensity as to constitute a vice an inhuman 
side, that is, which she might pardonably dis 
trust. The only thing for him doubtless now 
therefore would be to attest the intensity. He 
at last quitted the place with the step of a man 
proposing to test it on the spot. All this while, 





  

however, the anxiety truly deepest in him was 
about another affair. What in the world had 
happened to her in Europe ? 

It was when he reached the quiet scene which 
the recent lapse of his mother's soft pervasion 
had made so inconsequently, though now the 
abode of a more single state, not wider but nar 
rower, that the next great thing befell him. He 
found on his table a letter from a firm of London 
solicitors, a communication on the face of it 
most harmoniously timed. It appeared that 
under the will of his late kinsman, Mr. Philip 
Augustus Pendrel, he inherited property a fact 
enriched by the further mention, on the part of 
his informants, that should he find it convenient 
to come to England without undue delay his 
being on the spot would contribute to their action 
in his interest. It may immediately be said that 
the light wind of this stroke had even at the 
moment a happy effect on the heat of his wound. 
The event would certainly appeal with no great 
directness to the author of that injury, but its 
connection with the object of his other passion, 
as we have termed this source of inspiration, be 
came at once of the liveliest. He made as rapidly 
as possible his arrangements for a journey to 
London, but he had time, before winding up the 
situation in New York, to hear from his cousin's 
representatives of matters still further concern 
ing him and to receive from them in especial a 








  

letter addressed in that gentleman's hand and 
not at first found among his effects. It contained 
the only words that had, so far as he knew, come 
to any member of the American kinship, for two 
generations, from any member of the English. 
The English, he was perfectly aware, had been 
held by the American to be ofHsh and haughty, 
and the American had stiffened itself to show 
that, since the question was of turning an un 
conscious back, the game was playable wherever 
backs were broad enough to show which they 
made bold to feel themselves in the new country 
too. It was familiar to Ralph Pendrel that his 
father and his grandfather had fairly studied, 
and had practised with consistency, the art of 
the cold shoulder. They had each been more 
than once to England, but had "looked up" no 
body and nothing had clearly not acquainted 
themselves either by inquiry or closer visitation 
with those thin possibilities of something some 
day to their advantage, or to that of their pos 
terity, that might have been dreamed of at the 
best. The property mainly accruing to Ralph 
loomed large now as a house it was described 
as commodious in a fine quarter of the town; 
this remained at first the limit of his charmed 
apprehension. No light, of the dimmest, had 
previously reached him as to the English view 
of what he had always heard called at home 
"the American attitude." He had in growing 





  

older not much believed there could be an English 
view; but it would seem after all that over this 
ground his fancy had too shyly hovered. 

Mr. Pendrel's letter practically expressed the 
unsupposed quantity, and nothing surely could 
have been of more flattering effect. Written to 
be delivered after his death, it explained and 
enhanced, the delightful document shaking the 
tree, as it were, for the golden fruit to fall. What 
it came to was that he had read as an old man 
his young relative's remarkable volume, "An 
Essay in Aid of the Reading of History," and, 
wishing somehow to testify to the admiration he 
felt for it, had come to consider that no symbol 
would be so solid as the old English house form 
ing the sole item, in a long list of heavily ham 
pered possessions, that he was free thus to dispose 
of. It was a mere town tenement, and none of 
the newest, but it was the best repayment of his 
debt he could make. He had nowhere seen the 
love of old things, of the scrutable, palpable past  
nowhere felt an ear for stilled voices, as precious 
as they are faint, as seizable, truly, as they are 
fine, affirm a more remarkable power than in the 
pages that had moved him to gratitude. Unpre 
tending though the title, the spare volume, but 
I in which every word reached the mark, was a 
contribution to causes he had always had much 
at heart, a plea with which he rejoiced that the 
name of their family should have been associated. 





  

There were old things galore in Mansfield Square; 
the past, he considered, held its state there for 
those with the wit to make it out; and, should 
his young kinsman accept his bequest, he would 
find himself master of a scene in which a chapter 
of history obscure, though not so remote as 
might perhaps have been wished would perhaps 
by his intervention step more into the light. 
The generations at least had passed through it, 
clinging indeed as long as they might, and couldn't 
have failed to leave something of their mark, 
which it would doubtless interest Mr. Ralph to 
puzzle out. It was the testator's wish that he 
should do so at his ease. The letter in fine was, 
as Ralph said, a deucedly beautiful gentlemanly 
one, and the turn of the wheel of fortune. The 
material advantage might be uncertain; but it 
was blessedly not for the economic question, it 
was for the historic, the aesthetic, fairly in fact 
for the cryptic, that he cared. A big London 
house sounded in truth on the face of the matter 
less like an aid to research than like an exposure 
to rates and taxes, a legacy of the order vulgarly 
known as thumping. But verily too even London, 
for our rare young man, was within the pale of 
romance. His "other" passion in short had 
soon begun freshly to glow. 

Within a month it had shaken him still harder, 
and all the more that, this time, his impatience 
had fallen and two or three of his illusions with 





  

it: his curiosity had sat down to its feast. He 
had encountered in London more business than 
he expected, but had not encountered what he 
most feared, the display of a swarm of litigants. 
This greatly eased his mind, since if injustice had 
been done it would have taken much from the 
savour of the feast. There was no nearer relative, 
it surprisingly seemed, no counter-claimant, no 
hint in the air of a satisfaction disputed. No 
unfortunate and expropriated person came, in a 
word, to light, and there was therefore neither a 
cause to defend nor a sacrifice to consider. The 
only thing really to consider in such a stroke of 
luck was its violation of the common law of prose. 
Life was at best good prose when it wasn't bad; 
 and Mr. Pendrel's succession was all "town 
tenement" as it might be poetry undefiled. It 
was none the less poetry that the value of the 
property was so easily ascertained to be high. 
Ralph reflected not even for a moment after he 
had been to see it that a fine country estate would 
have been more to his purpose. He had no pur 
pose, he freely recognised, but to begin at once to 
cultivate whatever relation should seem most 
fruitful to his so suddenly acquired "stake" in an 
alien order. The circumstance of its being ex 
actly what it was of no greater extent, yet of no 
less dignity ministered beyond anything else for 
the new master to a sense of close communication 
with the old. It was extraordinary how on this 



  

ground the young man felt himself understood; 
and he reflected endlessly as well as amazedly on 
the fact that it had all been done for him by his 
slim composition of five years before, so timid, so 
futile in the light of his subsequent growth. The 
affair would have been less of a fairytale and 
had indeed thereby less of a charm if Mr. Pen- 
drel's impulse had been determined by such a 
book as he might now write. What a book, what 
books, moreover, should properly proceed, he said 
to himself, from a longer and nearer view of the 
silent secrets of the place ! These were what had 
been bequeathed him, these were what the hand 
of death had placed before him, on the table, 
as in a locked brass-bound box the key of which 
he was to find. It would not be by any weakness 
of his, please God, that a single one of them 
should fail of its message. 

He liked to think, as he took possession, that 
his kinsman was watching, and therewith waiting, 
beyond the grave; though the way he had ab 
stained from restrictive conditions from all, that 
is, save a single one hereafter to be mentioned 
was perhaps the deepest note in his good taste. 
The part played in the whole business by that 
happy principle was in truth at moments almost 
such as to make poor Ralph uneasy. There was 
a roundness in his fortune that might seem too 
much to beguile. Were blessings so unexpected 
ever, beyond a certain point, anything but traps ? 





  

Should he begin to make his way into the secrets, 
as they hovered and hung there, wearing a sort of 
sensible consistency, who could say where he 
might come out, into what dark deeps of knowl 
edge he might be drawn, or how he should "like," 
given what must perhaps at the best stick to him 
of insuperable modern prejudice, the face of some 
of his discoveries ? He encountered however on 
this ground of a possible menace to his peace a 
reassurance that sprang, and with all eagerness, 
from the very nature of his mind. He lived, so 
far as a wit sharpened by friction with the real 
permitted him, in his imagination; but if life was 
for this faculty but a chain of open doors through 
which endless connections danced there was yet 
no knowledge in the world on which one should 
wish a door closed. There was none at any rate 
that in the glow of his first impression of his prop 
erty he didn't desire much more to face than to 
shirk. If he was even in this early stage a little 
disconcerted it came only from the too narrow 

. limits in which Mr. Pendrel's personal image, 
meeting his mind's eye at odd moments on the 
spot and constantly invoked by his gratitude, 
appeared to have arranged to reveal itself. He 
would have been particularly grateful for a por 
trait; but though there were in the house other 
framed physiognomies these were things and not 
unluckily either! of a different order of reference, 
an order in which the friendly photograph 



  

for instance, whether of the late tenant of the 
place or of any other subject, played no part. 
The friendly photograph had been with us for 
half a century, but there was nothing there to 
Ralph's vision so new as that. Number Nine 
Mansfield Square affected that vision, in short, 
to a degree presently to be explained, as with an 
inimitable reserve in respect to the modern world. 
It had crossed the threshold of the century, the 
nineteenth, it had even measured a few steps of 
the portentous prospect, but where it had stopped, 
pulled up very short and as with its head in the 
air it had stopped, one might have surmised, 
with a kind of disgust. It had determined clearly, 
on the apprehension then interchanged, to have 
as little to say to the future as an animated home, 
of whatever period, might get off with. "And 
yet I am the future," Ralph Pendrel mused, "and 
I dream of making it speak.'   

Face to face with it then, when he felt that 
already and quite distinctly it was speaking 
which happened the first time that ever, key in 
hand, he was able to enter it unaccompanied 
there was an inconsequence to note, and one from 
which he drew a fine pleasure. He was thus 
moved more shrewdly to reflect that if he was so 
trusted there must have been something in him 
to inspire it. Was he to such a tune the future ? 
Had not his taste for "research," which was more 
personally his passion for the past, worked rather, 
and despite his comparative youth, to transmute 
him ? On the day he disembarked in England 
he felt himself as never before ranged in that 
interest, counted on that side of the line. It was 
to this he had been brought by his desire to re 
mount the stream of time, really to bathe in its 
upper and more natural waters, to risk even, as 
he might say, drinking of them. No man, he well 
believed, could ever so much have wanted to look 
behind and still behind to scale the high wall 
into which the successive years, each a squared 
block, pile themselves in our rear and look over 
as nearly as possible with the eye of sense into, 
unless it should rather be called out of, the vast 
prison yard. He was by the turn of his spirit 
oddly indifferent to the actual and the possible; 
his interest was all in the spent and the displaced, 
in what had been determined and composed round 
about him, what had been presented as a subject 
and a picture, by ceasing so far as things ever 
cease to bustle or even to be. It was when life 
was framed in death that the picture was really 
hung up. If his idea in fine was to recover the 
lost moment, to feel the stopped pulse, it was to 
do so as experience in order to be again consciously 
the creature that had been, to breathe as he had 
breathed and feel the pressure that he had felt. 
The truth most involved for him, so intent, in 
the insistent ardour of the artist, was that art 
was capable of an energy to this end never yet to 





  

all appearance fully required of it. With an ad 
dress less awkward, a wooing less shy, an embrace 
less weak, it would draw the foregone much closer  
to its breast. What he wanted himself was the 
very smell of that simpler mixture of things that 
had so long served; he wanted the very tick of \^ 
the old stopped clocks. He wanted the hour of 
the day at which this and that had happened, 
and the temperature and the weather and the 
sound, and yet more the stillness, from the street, 
and the exact look-out, with the corresponding 
look-in, through the window and the slant on the 
walls of the light of afternoons that had been. 
He wanted the unimaginable accidents, the little 
notes of truth for which the common lens of his 
tory, however the scowling muse might bury her 
nose, was not sufficiently fine. He wanted evi 
dence of a sort for which there had never been 
documents enough, or for which documents mainly, 
however multiplied, would never be enough. That 
was indeed in any case the artist's method to 
try for an ell in order to get an inch. The diffi 
cult, as at best it is, becomes under such condi 
tions so dire that to face it with any prospect one 
had to propose the impossible. Recovering the 
lost was at all events on this scale much like 
entering the enemy's lines to get back one's dead 
for burial; and to that extent was he not, by his 
deepening penetration, contemporaneous and pres 
ent ? "Present" was a word used by him in a 





  

sense of his own and meaning as regards most 
things about him markedly absent. It was for 
the old ghosts to take him for one of themselves. 
The spirit of gossip governed but little, he had 
promptly seen, the commerce of his friends the 
London solicitors with their clients; they were 
persons of a hard professional and facial surface 
and of settled dull complexion, giving back, on a 
rap of the knuckle, the special sharp answer, but 
not thereby corrupted to any human resonance. 
They betrayed to him in consequence few of Mr.
