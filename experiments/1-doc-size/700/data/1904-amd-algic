"I've had such a good, good time," she whispered, 
"but the best was to have you come out. Only 
hadn't you better let Ben walk out home with me?" 

"Oh, why?" in a tone of decided objection. 

"I can't just tell. It is one of the things you feel. 
He would like it. And you can come in to-morrow 
for dinner." 

That would compensate, but there was no need and 
I was secretly glad. Mr. Gaynor was there waiting 
for her with his mule cart, and I think the weary Little 
Girl was satisfied. 

That made a fine break in the everlasting political 
talk. No one was dreaming of Woman's Suffrage 
then, but the weaker sex were as strenuous for their 
favorite as the men. For a little while they forgot 



 

even him and enjoyed spiritual conferences, went to 
prayer meetings and exchanged experiences, sang 
hymns about their work. 

It seemed to me no one was very clear about the 
issues. General Harrison was a decided favorite, and 
even now it seems a matter of wonderment that he did 
not go in by acclaim. We of the frontier had a 
stronger regard for him than the Eastern States. 
They were more cultivated and leaned to the social 
instead of the military aspect. 

There were quarrels and not a few open brawls 
where pistols were used. Then came the great day of 
voting, and whiskey and betting were rampant. Chica 
go had improved a little on the old time, when all 
letters and news had been brought from Niles, Michi 
gan, by a hardy half-breed, only once a fortnight. 
Still, the tidings were slow in reaching us. And when 
it came Martin Van Buren was elected President of 
the United States of America. There was great rejoic 
ing among the Democrats. Bonfires were built out on 
the prairies; they were forbidden in the town. 

Indeed, there were a number of laws termed "The 
Ten Commandments," though some of them were not 
kept much better than the Mosaic Code. Pigs were 
not to wander in the streets, men were not to shoot off 
firearms in the limits, but they did. A stovepipe was 
not to run through a board partition, as if the city 
fathers had a premonition that fire would some day 
work a havoc. There was to be no horse racing in the 
streets, cards and dice were not to be played in taverns 
after ten o'clock. 





I was much interested to know how Mr. Gay nor 
would take it. He was by no means a red-hot politician, 
and though he had decided views he seldom allowed 
himself to wrangle, but turned off an argument with 
a joke or some humorous comparison. 

"Pity it isn't spring," he said dryly, "for then we 
could go to work and be sure of a long summer. Now 
we will be frozen up before you know it. I s'pose your 
folks are shouting. Well go ahead and have all the 
hurrahing that you can. It's a long lane that hasn't 
any turning, and ours has been pretty long. I think 
I see the turn four years ahead," with a funny twinkle 
in his left eye. 

"I don't see that the President has so much power," 
I subjoined. I belonged to a debating society now, 
and we were discussing the affairs of the country. 
"He can veto. Then he has a cabinet to advise 
him" 

"Well, he doesn't when you come to that, but I ob 
serve that he has to shoulder the blame of an unfortu 
nate administration. I wouldn't give a fig for your 
President, but I do hope Congress will do a little for 
us. Those Eastern fellows haven't an idea of what this 
section is going to be. They think they have the whole 
Atlantic Ocean and trade, and some day we'll have to 
feed them, keep them from starving. Why, the wheat 
fields will be the wonder of the world fifty years 
hence." 

He was buying prairie land and seeding it to grain, 
planting corn and feeding pigs. 

I remember his telling mother one time about elec- 



 

tion cake that the Eastern housekeepers made to treat 
their friends. 

" 'T would take a mighty sight to go round here," 
said mother. 

I was amazed to see animosities settle so soon and 
the men who had threatened to "blow off each other's 
heads" smoked the pipe of peace around the tavern 
stove. They were really country taverns, where neigh 
bors came for a friendly gossip, even if they did drink 
a little whiskey and bet on a game of cards. 

I think Mr. Harris was very much interested in 
furthering my turn for knowledge. He lent me books, 
he asked me to spend the evenings with him. He had a 
nice cheerful room with a married sister. He had 
several volumes of poetry that I borrowed for the Little 
Girl. Oh, what delight we took in "Percy's Reliques" 
and some of the old ballad singers ! 

She grew very slowly, it seemed to me, but then we 
were such big fellows. Homer went to a carpenter to 
learn a trade, building being considered a very good 
business. He was fully as tall as I, but he had no 
especial taste for books, though he was very quick 
and ingenious, and full of fun and frolic. There were 
dances once a fortnight in one of the rooms at the old 
fort, which was put to various uses, now that the Gov 
ernment had removed the troops. The court was held 
there, commissioners met to confer and ordain, pay 
taxes and make complaints. Everybody had a curious 
sympathetic feeling about it, as if it was in some sort 
a monument that commemorated the massacre. For 
some time after the treaty, when the Government 





purchased their lands, they distributed goods to the 
Indians every year. This was on the prairie, on the 
west side of the river, and we used to make it quite a 
holiday. The Indians sat around in a circle with the 
squaws behind them. There was a great pile of goods 
which the traders and some of the half-breeds began to 
distribute. At first the row of Indians was quite 
orderly. Then dissatisfaction would begin and they 
would rise to their knees, gesticulating and vociferat 
ing their mixed gibberish until it seemed they might 
break out into open war. Then there would be a gen 
eral scramble, the squaws throwing back articles they 
did not care for and seizing a lot, that, perhaps, gave 
them no greater satisfaction. 

The day ended by a big fire kindled far enough from 
the wigwams to escape the danger of conflagration, 
and the braves would dance around it in a furious man 
ner. Occasionally there were brawls for several days, 
which culminated in killing a number, and many of the 
braves would part with their goods to whoever would 
trade whiskey for them, though this had to be done 
underhand. 

All Chicago was glad and relieved when they were 
removed to their allotment. Forty ox teams carried 
the children and the baggage, while the braves and 
squaws marched leisurely, encamping for the night, 
and were nearly a month reaching their journey's end. 

We were not rid of all the Indians, however. There 
were some who preferred semi-civilization and 
whiskey, and not a few half-breeds whose descendants 
were to be proud of their Indian blood in after years. 



 

There had been mixed marriages, mostly French trad 
ers, with Indian wives, and some of these made worthy 
citizens. 

One of the Ottawa chiefs, who had prevented a 
massacre, after the defeat of Mayor Stillman's force, 
still remained in a noted place called Shabbona's Grove. 
Shabbonee kept the respect and friendship of the 
whites, and was quite a power in quelling disputes 
among his own nation. While most of the savages in 
our vicinity were not such as to inspire one with even 
tolerant sympathy, he was more like the heroes of 
romance that have been handed down to us from our 
forefathers. A broad-shouldered, stalwart specimen 
of his tribe, with a more intelligent face and strength 
of feature and character than even the average. 

Times were very hard and through the winter little 
could be doing. Plans there were in abundance. Men 
lingered in the warm shelter of the warehouse and 
wrangled, of course. I think now it was the fore 
shadowing of "bulls and bears" that were to dominate 
the town in the years to come. One party drew 
roseate pictures of the possibilities of the coming 
Chicago. We were to be the centre of trade we were 
between the east and the west, not only that, but there 
was Canada and the lakes and the mineral wealth of 
upper Michigan, the boundless prairies. 

And the others sneered at the mud hole and saw 
dozens of ways in which trade could be diverted. The 
canal wouldn't ever be finished, the towns along the 
Mississippi had the start of us and would keep it. 
Cities would spring up along its banks as if by magic. 





There was the gathering trade centring in the mighty 
gulf, the outlet to France and England, even to the 
Coast States. What could we produce to compete with 
them! Would the great cities of the east be generous 
enough to fall back and beckon us on? Trade looked 
out for itself first of all. 

I used to repeat these arguments to Mr. Gaynor. 
Sometimes when he wanted to go out of an evening 
he asked me to drop in so that Ruth would not be left 
alone. The handmaid, Melissa Hatch, had married 
and rejoiced in a two-room shanty of her own, but did 
not disdain coming in for a few hours daily and taking 
the rough work. They were rather gay and spent their 
evenings card playing and dancing with their neigh 
bors. Fiddling was a common accomplishment. The 
dancing was more of the jig, or breakdown, order. 
Two people would dance to each other, executing all 
sorts of fancy steps, then turn to the next couple and 
pair off, and so on until they had gone around the 
room. If there were not more than four people they 
seemed to have just as merry a time. Then a little hot 
whiskey, and to home and to bed. No midnight dissi 
pations for them. 

Not that Mr. Gaynor was given to these festivities. 
He would go over to the Tremont or to Baubein's and 
listen to the talk, now and then putting in some shrewd 
remark or a bit of humor, and often caught an idea 
that he saved up for future consideration, and when the 
time came used it and made a success of it. 

"All this talk doesn't bother me," he would say 
dryly. "New land's the place for fine crops. To the 



 

eastward you have to pick stones until you feel as if 
you had a ball and chain to your leg. Land's getting 
worn out, too. Some day they'll have to come to us 
for bread. They can't farm and manufacture at the 
same time, and they're just besotted on building towns 
and calling in people to work in factories. All well 
enough for those who like it, but these people will all 
have to be fed and some one will have to raise the 
stuff." 

He was a typical Yankee for barter. He always had 
something the neighbors wanted, or could give assist 
ance when it was most needed and take it out in some 
thing else, for there really was no money. He raised 
excellent stock. He looked at a thing, a pig or a pile 
of boards, or even a bit of land, squinting up one eye, 
and saw its good points at once. And he managed to 
keep on the right side of every one. 

So I spent half my time at the Gaynors', mother said. 
Dan was a gay young chap in great demand with the 
girls, ready for any frolic, and already was the owner 
of a fine horse that he was very generous with when he 
had time to drive, and the girls were ready to tear each 
other half to pieces for the chance. 

"I jest wish he'd settle down to one," mother would 
say complainingly. "There's no look when a fellow's 
butterflyin' round. He ain't like a bee who has some 
sense, but jest goes from flower to flower, an' that's 
the way with Dan. I ain't no ways anxious to have 
Polly Morrison for a daughter, but I did settle upon 
it a while ago, an' now it's Betty Hale, but it does 
seem as if some girl might catch him an' sober him 





down. He's smart to earn, but he'll never be fore 
handed until some woman gets hold of the purse 
strings." 

Early marriages were quite in vogue, the general 
trend of new countries. 

I did not have to consider the point, for twenty-one 
was early enough. And I was more interested in 
books than girls in general. I was not much of a 
dancer, and I think I was a little afraid of the quick, 
saucy retorts of the girls. I liked the sledding parties 
in winter and the skating. We even navigated about 
on snow shoes, and it was very exhilarating when there 
was a sharp crust frozen over the snow. On clear 
moonlight nights there was an indescribable splendor 
in the far sparkling reaches, whose only limit seemed 
the boundary of the blue sky, studded with brilliant 
gems of all colors, it seemed at such times, and chang 
ing, as if no settled tint predominated, as the air went 
waving among them, driving a flock here as if they 
were birds of mystery, then confronted by some dar 
ing immovable fixed star. I used to stand in silent 
wonder, they were so marvellous. 

"And to think that heaven is behind them all," the 
Little Girl would say with grave eyes. 

We were a good deal troubled with wolves and now 
and then there was a regular hunt. Dan was always 
delighted with such adventures. Some more valuable 
animals were captured as well. 

But spring came on amain, and curiously enough, 
business seemed stirring up in spite of hard times and 
money disturbances. The people of Chicago were 



 

workers. They began to look after the streets a little, 
to straighten the houses that had been set in every 
fashion, and though there did not seem much of 
promise to call them thither, emmigrants were arriving 
nearly every day in all sorts of vehicles, and of several 
nationalities. The French had quite a little settlement 
to themselves, Germans began to look for outlying 
farms, some had already bought Government land. 
There were still Indian wigwams, in which squaws 
labored and pappooses abounded. 

And though it was not a highly diversified country, 
and many things were left for the hand of man to ac 
complish, still it took on a certain beauty. The broad 
belt of timber to the west stood up sentinel like, to the 
south there were various rises of ground; there were 
the broad prairies and the magnificent lake, beginning 
to be dotted with vessels of all the rather primitive 
kinds. The building of the Clarissa had been con 
sidered a great achievement, and was being followed 
by others. 

Gardens came out in summer bravery. Many of 
them were an acre or two in extent. Apples and plums 
grew readily, indeed it seemed as if plums were in 
digenous to the soil. Smaller fruits were cultivated, 
and all those not likely to be killed with the hard cold 
winters. 

Here and there you saw prairie schooners, as they 
were called, with a double team of oxen lumbering 
along with a load of logs from some more favorable 
point for the saw mill. Wheat fields waved in the sun 
shine, making billows like the sea. Cornfields green 





and strong shot up like armies. Rye and oats every 
thing grew as if by magic. Doors were wide open, and 
women sat spinning, or some one ran to and fro with 
nimble feet at the big wheel. 

In another house was a loom, the warping bars hung 
with skeins of colored yarns, and the ceiling of the 
homely interior still ornamented with the remnants of 
winter provender, where there had been abundant stor 
ing. Children played around outside, older ones went 
to and from school, raced about in childish games, 
handed down from generation to generation. A 
neighbor woman in a faded blue gown and sunbonnet 
stopped to gossip awhile at some one's door as to who 
was "keepin' stiddy comp'ny," who had been buying a 
cow or putting up a shanty, or "dyein' of ther' yarn." 
Less than three quarters of a century ago they had 
dreams of greatness then, but they would have fainted 
to see this day. 

The Little Girl had learned to spin and had a wheel, 
She had learned many other things as well, and some 
of the older people thought she was "fittin' to keep 
house athought any help." But M'liss was glad to 
come in daily, though now she brought a small 
bundle, rolled in an old shawl, which she generally 
deposited on a bench and stood a chair-back against 
it. 

"I jest useter think it was orful to strap them little 
Injun babies on a board an' hang 'em to a tree, but I 
dunno. They want ter be made straight, an' fraish air 
is good fer 'em. I s'pose people'd think I was orful 
unhuman to do it, but lawsy a' massy me, what does 



 

anything like that want but jest to lay still an' grow 
till it gets some sense." 

Ruth was not enchanted with the baby, though she 
berated herself for a kind of hard-heartedness. It had 
a funny little face screwed up to a point in the centre, 
with a sloping forehead and no chin to speak of, and it 
was a curious red brown. 

" 'Tain't no great beauty," M'liss admitted. "But I 
never see one that was. Ther's a big world fer 'em to 
grow good lookin' in if they hev the gift, an' 
if they hevn't, why, they hevn't, thet's all. I can't say 
I was eszatly hankerin' fer it, but it's here, an' sent 
fer some wise perpose, mebbe." 

M'liss was very glad of the good meal and the chunk 
of pork or loaf of bread she earned. The Little Girl 
only went to school for half a day now, she was learn 
ing so many useful things at home to make her her 
father's housekeeper. He was always very tender to 
her I noticed, and thought her very smart. 

Sometimes when we sat on the doorstep of an even 
ing he would join the talk. His father and grand 
father had been Revolutionary patriots. He had been 
to Boston and sailed from there to New York and 
back, and knew a good deal about the geography of the 
Eastern States. I brought out my store of knowledge, 
gleaned from traders who stopped at the warehouse. 
Some of the stories seemed too marvellous for belief, 
and now they are commonplace history. 

The only thing Ruth was really slow about was 
figures. Mr. Gaynor was very quick and could not 
seem to understand it. 




"You must learn," he would say. "I may get old 
and lose my eyesight, then you'll have to do my 
clerking." 

So we used to labor with her. She knew her tables, 
children learned them perfectly in those days, but there 
was some little knack of applying them in which she 
seemed deficient. And when we were alone she would 
say: 

"Oh, don't bother. Let us read. When I am grown 
up it will all come easy enough," and her winsome 
smile always persuaded me. 

Mr. Harris had loaned me "Pope's Illiad," recom 
mended it to me, in fact. When I had gone about half 
through I was so enchanted that I brought it to 
her, and turned back that we might share it together. 
How wonderful it seemed to us! We took it 
in as every word true. These were the people 
who lived long before America was discovered, 
long before William the Norman crossed over to 
Britain. 

"But I do wonder if men must always fight," she 
said with a sigh. 

We were at peace then except for an occasional 
Indian skirmish, but these glowing descriptions did 
stir my blood. 

Then there was an old copy of the "Morte'd Arthur" 
that we revelled in. And there were outside enjoy 
ments, rambles about on Sunday afternoons that we 
did not keep as strictly as the people to the eastward. 
Mr. Gaynor was full of funny stories about the old 
blue laws, as they were called, of having a hen put to 



 

death because she laid an egg on Sunday. But one 
that amused us very much was the old couplet : 

"The deacon, he whipped the barrel of beer 
Because it worked on Sunday." 

There was some splendid birch and sassafras beer 
made in many families, and though there was a good 
deal of whiskey used, numbers of the best men 
frowned on habitual drinking. 

One of the great amusements on Saturday after 
noon was horse racing. This had to be outside the 
town. It created immense enthusiasm. Several of the 
young Indians owned fine horses and were proud 
enough of them. Dan entered his beautiful Chita, and 
after some training and several attempts she won a 
race, to his great delight. We had gone out, and I must 
say my inmost heart was stirred at the sight, but I had 
not thought the laurel wreath would descend to us. It 
was a perfect ovation. And that night he came home 
much the worse for drinking, and he and father had 
quite a desperate quarrel. 

"I should like to shoot the mare!" declared 
father. 

"He'd move heaven and earth to get another," and 
mother put her arm over father's shoulder. "Dan is 
a pretty good boy in the main, and I'm hoping he will 
get a wife some day to steady him." 

"Polly Morrison !" flung out father scornfully. 

"No," I hope it won't be Polly Morrison." 

Polly was a slim, lithe slip of a girl that no two 
people ever agreed about. Her skin was of lily fair- 



ness no matter what she did. Her eyes were large, and 
although glorious does not seem the proper adjective, 
that is what they were. Brown, with golden lights 
that could flash and laugh and turn so tender, you were 
sure they were in tears. She had a rather wide mouth, 
full of curves and dimples. The one thing that laid 
her open to criticism was her hair. Somehow red hair 
was not in high favor, and though her admirers 
quarrelled about it, red it surely was, the deep rich sort 
of mahogany red, with a gloss as if the sun shone upon 
it. There were great waves from the white parting to 
the coil which covered the back of her head. Occa 
sionally she shook it down, and it was a glistening 
cloud about her, looking like something alive. She was 
a harum-scarum sort of a girl, could row equal to a 
man, ride bareback, run races, dance like a creature 
bewitched, go to church on Sunday and look as demure 
as a saint. 

That summer Chicago was all astir. It didn't matter 
to anybody whether Martin Van Buren was President 
or not. There were processions of grain coming in, 
ox loads, precursors of trains that no one dreamed of 
then, bringing it in sheets and blankets, begged of 
the housewives when bags were filled, and there was 
the crude elevator, the grain hoisted by hand with 
block and tackle, and dumped into the hold of the big 
Osceola. Twenty-nine hundred bushels to be sent to 
Black Rock, New York State, the beginning of the 
mighty contribution that was to enrich not only the 
city, but the east as well, and in future times to stand 
between the world and starvation. 



 

Crowds went to see it. How proud everybody was. 
John Gaynor rubbed his hands in glee. 

"What did I tell you!" he kept saying in triumph. 
"This will sometime be the great city of the world, and 
those blasted fools at Washington can't see that we 
need anything, not even to have the canal finished. 
Well, we will surprise them yet." 

He was not much given to swearing, though pro 
fanity seemed rather in the air. The good parsons 
preached against it, and some of the best men rarely 
used an oath. 

For days nothing was talked of but the exploit. 
The Osceola had gone off with the cheers of the 
crowd. But when the jubilation subsided a little, 
new plans were made for the elevator to use 
horsepower instead of hand, and to enlarge its 
capacity. 

Crops of all kinds had been good. The yield of corn 
was tremendous. Pigs were in demand ; there was 
plenty to fatten them. We were almost as likely to 
have a boom in these products as there had been 
in real estate a few years before. 

Mr. Dole had been slaughtering and packing cattle 
of both kinds down on Dearborn and South Water 
streets. The small log building where he first lived 
stood three doors east of the warehouse, but now he 
had built a more commodious dwelling. Mr. Thomp 
son was in his new office and still busy surveying and 
mapping out lots, and making trades that, as father 
said, kept the log rolling without any money. Mr. 
Thomas Church had enlarged his store, and the women 





had a gala time going to see the pretty things every 
few months when a new stock came in. 

The older inhabitants still kept to weaving linsey 
woolsey and common grades of woollen, as well as 
some of the coarser cotton cloths. Spinning and knit 
ting was much in vogue, but the girls beginning to 
grow up rather protested against the labor. And the 
goods coming from the States and abroad were so 
pretty and tempting. So butter and eggs were bartered 
off, strong sacking stuff, pork and woollen stockings 
for the boatmen and the voyagers. 

Mr. Carpenter was building a fine house over on 
the west side and setting out choice fruits that stirred 
others up to emulation. Then we had a daily paper, 
the American having started a precarious venture that 
most men predicted would be a failure, and ''where 
could any one find news enough to fill up a daily 
paper?" was on the tongues of the objectors. It might 
not have been the highest intellectual pabulum, but we 
were not educated up to that mark, and somehow we 
took to the effort most cordially and wondered how 
we could have done without it. 

"You can't wash out a hankercheer now an' hang 
it on a bush, a'thought everybody knowin' it," grum 
bled Grandmother Green, "an' I kin hear all the news 
I want on prayer-meetin' night. I hain't got no 
money to go foolin' round stores an' other people 
wouldn't 'nother if they paid ther' just debts." 



CHAPTER VI 

THEN THE UNCOMMON 

THAT autumn a theatre was opened on the west side 
of Dearborn Street, over a general store, a plain, 
wooden building. The second floor was seated and a 
stage erected with rather crude paraphernalia. It was 
called the Rialto. A Mr. McKenzie was manager and 
stage director, and some very good plays were given 
with William Warren, Mrs. Ingersol and Mr. Jeffer 
son, with little Joe in his first attempts. They had very 
fair audiences, and it was a step above the card playing. 
There were also some lectures given, and several edu 
cational plans brought to the fore. If they were to be 
a great city they must rouse themselves on every 
side. 

I went to the theatre with Ruth and Mr. Gaynor. 
He, it seems, had seen several plays. Ruth was 
curiously interested. 

"Why, it is like what people say and do all the 
time," she said with a rather puzzled air. "Not as 
funny as some of the stories they tell. And somehow, 
you seem to lose the thread. You want to know what 





they did in between. I believe I'd rather read the 
whole story." 

I began to be curious about Shakespeare's plays, and 
talked them over with Mr. Harris. 

"Oh, if you want to read them aloud to a little girl, 
I will let you have Charles and Mary Lamb's stories," 
he said. "You will enjoy them better." 

And enjoy them we surely did. 

But one night we had a great alarm. There had 
been occasional fires, still so many of the houses being
