had often thought before, of the stoutness of the human 
composition in the Middle Ages, and the tranquillity 
of nerve of people to whom the groaning captive and 
the blackness of a "living tomb" were familiar ideas, 
which did not at all interfere with their happiness or 
their sanity. Our modern nerves, our irritable sym 
pathies, our easy discomforts and fears, make one think 
(in some relations) less respectfully of human nature. 
Unless, indeed, it be true, as I have heard it main 
tained, that in the Middle Ages every one did go mad, 
every one was mad. The theory that this was a 
period of general insanity is not altogether indefensible. 
Within the old walls of its immense abbey the 
town of Villeneuve has built itself a rough faubourg; 
the fragments with which the soil was covered having 
been, I suppose, a quarry of material. There are no 
streets; the small, shabby houses, almost hovels, straggle 
at random over the uneven ground. The only im 
portant feature is a convent of cloistered nuns, who 
have a large garden (always within the walls) behind 
their house, and whose doleful establishment you look 
down into, or down at simply, from the battlements of 


the citadel. One or two of the nuns were passing in 
and out of the house; they wore gray robes, with a 
bright red cape. I thought their situation most pro 
vincial. I came away, and wandered a little over the 
base of the hill, outside the walls. Small white stones 
cropped through the grass, over which low olive-trees 
were scattered. The afternoon had a yellow bright 
ness. I sat down under one of the little trees, on the 
grass, the delicate gray branches were not much 
above my head, and rested, and looked at Avignon 
across the Rhone. It was very soft, very still and 
pleasant, though I am not sure it was all I once should 
have expected of that combination of elements : an old 
city wall for a background, a canopy of olives, and, 
for a couch, the soil of Provence. 

When I came back to Avignon the twilight was 
already thick; but I walked up to the Rocher dcs 
Doms. Here I again had the benefit of that amiable 
moon which had already lighted up for me so many 
romantic scenes. She was full, and she rose over the 
Rhone, and made it look in the distance like a silver 
serpent. I remember saying to myself at this mo 
ment, that it would be a beautiful evening to walk 
round the walls of Avignon, the remarkable walls, 
which challenge comparison with those of Carcassonne 
and Aigues-Mortes , and which it was my duty, as an 
observer of the picturesque, to examine with some at 
tention. Presenting themselves to that silver sheen, 
they could not fail to be impressive. So, at least, I 
said to myself; but, unfortunately, I did not believe 



  

what I said. It is a melancholy fact that the walls of 
Avignon had never impressed me at all, and I had 
never taken the trouble to make the circuit. They 
are continuous and complete, but for some mysterious 
reason they fail of their effect. This is partly because 
they are very low, in some places almost absurdly so; 
being buried in new accumulations of soil, and by 
the filling in of the moat up to their middle. Then 
they have been too well tended ; they not only look at 
present very new, but look as if they had never been 
old. The fact that their extent is very much greater 
makes them more of a curiosity than those of Carcas 
sonne; but this is exactly, as the same time, what is 
fatal to their pictorial unity. With their thirty-seven 
towers and seven gates they lose themselves too much 
to make a picture that will compare with the ad 
mirable little vignette of Carcassonne. I may mention, 
now that I am speaking of the general mass of Avignon, 
that nothing is more curious than the way in which, 
viewed from a distance, it is all reduced to nought by 
the vast bulk of the palace of the Popes. From across 
the Rhone, or from the train, as you leave the place, 
this great gray block is all Avignon; it seems to occupy 
the whole city, extensive, with its shrunken population, 
as the city is. 
 

IT was the morning after this, I think (a certain 
Saturday), that when I came out of the Hotel de 
l'Europe, which lies in a shallow concavity just within 
the city gate that opens on the Rhone, came out to 
look at the sky from the little place before the inn, 
and see how the weather promised for the obligatory 
excursion to Vaucluse, I found the whole town in a 
terrible taking. I say the whole town advisedly; for 
every inhabitant appeared to have taken up a position 
on the bank of the river, or on the uppermost parts 
of the promenade of the Doms, where a view of its 
course was to be obtained. It had risen surprisingly 
in the night, and the good people of Avignon had 
reason to know what a rise of the Rhone might signify. 
The town, in its lower portions, is quite at the mercy 
of the swollen waters; and it was mentioned to me 
that in 1856 the Hotel de FEurope, in its convenient 
hollow, was flooded up to within a few feet of the 
ceiling of the dining-room, where the long board which 
had served for so many a table d hote floated dis 
reputably, with its legs in the air. On the present 
occasion the mountains of the Ardeche, where it had 
been raining for a month, had sent down torrents 
which, all that fine Friday night, by the light of the 
innocent-looking moon, poured themselves into the 
Rhone and its tributary, the Durance. The river was 
enormous, and continued to rise; and the sight was 



  

beautiful and horrible. The water in many places 
was already at the base of the city walls; the quay, 
with its parapet just emerging, being already covered. 
The country, seen from the Plateau des Doms, re 
sembled a vast lake, with protrusions of trees, houses, 
bridges, gates. The people looked at it in silence, as 
I had seen people before on the occasion of a rise 
of the Arno, at Pisa appear to consider the prospects 
of an inundation. "II monte; il monte toujours," 
there was not much said but that. It was a general 
holiday, and there was an air of wishing to profit, for 
sociability 's sake, by any interruption of the common 
place (the popular mind likes "a change," and the 
element of change mitigates the sense of disaster); but 
the affair was not otherwise a holiday. Suspense and 
anxiety were in the air, and it never is pleasant to be 
reminded of the helplessness of man. In the presence 
of a loosened river, with its ravaging, unconquerable 
volume, this impression is as strong as possible; and 
as I looked at the deluge which threatened to make 
an island of the Papal palace, I perceived that the 
scourge of water is greater than the scourge of fire. 
A blaze may be quenched, but where could the flame 
be kindled that would arrest the quadrupled Rhone? 
For the population of Avignon a good deal was at 
stake, and I am almost ashamed to confess that in the 
midst of the public alarm I considered the situation 
from the point of view of the little projects of a senti 
mental tourist. Would the prospective inundation inter 
fere with my visit to Vaucluse, or make it imprudent 





to linger twenty- four hours longer at Avignon? I must 
add that the tourist was not perhaps, after all, so 
sentimental. I have spoken of the pilgrimage to the 
shrine of Petrarch as obligatory, and that was, in fact, 
the light in which it presented itself to me; all the 
more that I had been twice at Avignon without under- 
taking it. This is why I was vexed at the Rhone if 
vexed I was for representing as impracticable an ex 
cursion which I cared nothing about. How little I 
cared was manifest from my inaction on former oc 
casions. I had a prejudice against Vaucluse, against 
Petrarch, even against the incomparable Laura. I was 
sure that the place was cockneyfied and threadbare, 
and I had never been able to take an interest in the 
poet and the lady. I was sure that I had known many 
women as charming and as handsome as she, about 
whom much less noise had been made; and I was 
convinced that her singer was factitious and literary, 
and that there are half a dozen stanzas in Wordsworth 
that speak more to the soul than the whole collection 
of his fioriture. This was the crude state of mind in 
which I determined to go, at any risk, to Vaucluse. 
Now that I think it over, I seem to remember that I 
had hoped, after all, that the submersion of the roads 
would forbid it. Since morning the clouds had gathered 
again, and by noon they were so heavy that there was 
every prospect of a torrent. It appeared absurd to 
choose such a time as this to visit a fountain a 
fountain which would be indistinguishable in the 
general cataract. Nevertheless I took a vow, that if 



  

at noon the rain should not have begun to descend 
upon Avignon I would repair to the head-spring of the 
Sorgues. When the critical moment arrived, the clouds 
were hanging over Avignon like distended water-bags, 
which only needed a prick to empty themselves. The 
prick was not given, however; all nature was too much 
occupied in following the aberration of the Rhone to 
think of playing tricks elsewhere. Accordingly, I started 
for the station in a spirit which, for a tourist who 
sometimes had prided himself on his unfailing supply 
of sentiment, was shockingly perfunctory. 

For tasks in hours of insight willed 
May be in hours of gloom fulfilled. " 

I remembered these lines of Matthew Arnold (written, 
apparently, in an hour of gloom), and carried out the 
idea, as I went, by hoping that with the return of in 
sight I should be glad to have seen Vaucluse. Light 
has descended upon me since then, and I declare that 
the excursion is in every way to be recommended. 
The place makes a great impression, quite apart from 
Petrarch and Laura. 

There was no rain; there was only, all the after 
noon, a mild, moist wind, and a sky magnificently 
black, which made a repoussoir for the paler cliffs of 
the fountain. The road, by train, crosses a flat, ex 
pressionless country, toward the range of arid hills 
which lie to the east of Avignon, and which spring 
(says Murray) from the mass of the Mont-Ventoux. At 
Isle-sur-Sorgues, at the end of about an hour, the fore- 





ground becomes much more animated and the distance 
much more (or perhaps I should say much less) actual. 
I descended from the train, and ascended to the top 
of an omnibus which was to convey me into the re 
cesses of the hills. It had not been among my pre 
visions that I should be indebted to a vehicle of that 
kind for an opportunity to commune with the spirit of 
Petrarch; and I had to borrow what consolation I 
could from the fact that at least I had the omnibus to 
myself. I was the only passenger; every one else was 
at Avignon, watching the Rhone. I lost no time in 
perceiving that I could not have come to Vaucluse at 
a better moment. The Sorgues was almost as full as 
the Rhone, and of a color much more romantic. Rush 
ing along its narrowed channel under an avenue of 
fine platanes (it is confined between solid little embank 
ments of stone), with the good-wives of the village , on 
the brink, washing their linen in its contemptuous 
flood, it gave promise of high entertainment further on. 
The drive to Vaucluse is of about three quarters of 
an hour; and though the river, as I say, was promis 
ing, the big pale hills, as the road winds into them, 
did not look as if their slopes of stone and shrub were 
a nestling-place for superior scenery. It is a part of 
the merit of Vaucluse, indeed, that it is as much as 
possible a surprise. The place has a right to its name, 
for the valley appears impenetrable until you get fairly 
into it. One perverse twist follows another, until the 
omnibus suddenly deposits you in front of the "cabinet" 
of Petrarch. After that you have only to walk along 



  

the left bank of the river. The cabinet of Petrarch is 
to-day a hideous little cafe, bedizened, like a sign 
board, with extracts from the ingenious "Rime." The 
poet and his lady are, of course, the stock in trade of 
the little village, which has had for several generations 
the privilege of attracting young couples engaged in 
their wedding-tour, and other votaries of the tender 
passion. The place has long been familiar, on festal 
Sundays, to the swains of Avignon and their attendant 
nymphs. The little fish of the Sorgues are much 
esteemed, and, eaten on the spot, they constitute, for 
the children of the once Papal city, the classic sub 
urban dinner. Vaucluse has been turned to account, 
however, not only by sentiment, but by industry; the 
banks of the stream being disfigured by a pair of 
hideous mills for the manufacture of paper and of 
wool. In an enterprising and economical age the 
water-power of the Sorgues was too obvious a motive; 
and I must say that, as the torrent rushed past them, 
the wheels of the dirty little factories appeared to turn 
merrily enough. The footpath on the left bank, of 
which I just spoke, carries one, fortunately, quite out 
of sight of them, and out of sound as well, inasmuch 
as on the day of my visit the stream itself, which was 
in tremendous force, tended more and more, as one 
approached the fountain, to fill the valley with its own 
echoes. Its color was magnificent, and the whole 
spectacle more like a corner of Switzerland than a 
nook in Provence. The protrusions of the mountain 
shut it in, and you penetrate to the bottom of the re- 





cess which they form. The Sorgues rushes and rushes; 
it is almost like Niagara after the jump of the cataract. 
There are dreadful little booths beside the path, for 
the sale of photographs and immortelles  I don't know 
what one is to do with the immortelles, where you 
are offered a brush dipped in tar to write your name 
withal on the rocks. Thousands of vulgar persons , of 
both sexes, and exclusively, it appeared, of the French 
nationality, had availed themselves of this implement; 
for every square inch of accessible stone was scored 
over with some human appellation. It is not only we 
in America, therefore, who besmirch our scenery; the 
practice exists, in a more organized form (like every 
thing else in France), in the country of good taste. 
You leave the little booths and stalls behind; but the 
bescribbled crag, bristling with human vanity, keeps 
you company even when you stand face to face with 
the fountain. This happens when you find yourself 
at the foot of the enormous straight cliff out of which 
the river gushes. It rears itself to an extraordinary 
height, a huge forehead of bare stone, lacking as 
if it were the half of a tremendous mound, split open 
by volcanic action. The little valley, seeing it there, 
at a bend, stops suddenly, and receives in its arms 
the magical spring. I call it magical on account of 
the mysterious manner in which it comes into the 
world, with the huge shoulder of the mountain rising 
over it, as if to protect the secret. From under the 
mountain it silently rises, without visible movement, 
filling a small natural basin with the stillest blue 



  

water. The contrast between the stillness of this basin 
and the agitation of the water directly after it has 
overflowed, constitutes half the charm of Vaucluse. 
The violence of the stream when once it has been set 
loose on the rocks is as fascinating and indescribable 
as that of other cataracts; and the rocks in the bed of 
the Sorgues have been arranged by a master-hand. 
The setting of the phenomenon struck me as so simple 
and so fine the vast sad cliff, covered with the after 
noon light, still and solid forever, while the liquid ele 
ment rages and roars at its base -that I had no diffi 
culty in understanding the celebrity of Vaucluse. I 
understood it, but I will not say that I understood 
Petrarch. He must have been very self-supporting, and 
Madonna Laura must indeed have been much to him. 
The aridity of the hills that shut in the valley is 
complete, and the whole impression is best conveyed 
by that very expressive French epithet morne. There 
are the very fragmentary ruins of a castle (of one of 
the bishops of Cavaillon) on a high spur of the moun 
tain, above the river; and there is another remnant of 
a feudal habitation on one of the more accessible 
ledges. Having half an hour to spare before my 
omnibus was to leave (I must beg the reader 's pardon 
for this atrociously false note; call the vehicle a dili 
gence, and for some undiscoverable reason the offence 
is minimized), I clambered up to this latter spot, and 
sat among the rocks in the company of a few stunted 
olives. The Sorgues, beneath me, reaching the plain, 
flung itself crookedly across the meadows, like an un- 





rolled blue ribbon. I tried to think of the amant de 
Laure, for literature 's sake; but I had no great success, 
and the most I could do was to say to myself that I 
must try again. Several months have elapsed since 
then, and I am ashamed to confess that the trial has 
not yet come off. The only very definite conviction I 
arrived at was that Vaucluse is indeed cockneyfied, 
but that I should have been a fool, all the same, not 
to come. 



XXXVI. 

I MOUNTED into my diligence at the door of the 
Hotel de Petrarque et de Laure, and we made our 
way back to Isle-sur-Sorgues in the fading light. This 
village, where at six o clock every one appeared to 
have gone to bed, was fairly darkened by its high, 
dense plane-trees, under which the rushing river, on 
a level with its parapets, looked unnaturally, almost 
wickedly blue. It was a glimpse which has left a 
picture in my mind: the little closed houses, the place 
empty and soundless in the autumn dusk but for the 
noise of waters, and in the middle, amid the blackness 
of the shade, the gleam of the swift, strange tide. At 
the station every one was talking of the inundation 
being in many places an accomplished fact, and, in 
particular, of the condition of the Durance at some 
point that I have forgotten. At Avignon, an hour 
later, I found the water in some of the streets. The 



  

sky cleared in the evening, the moon lighted up the 
submerged suburbs, and the population again collected 
in the high places to enjoy the spectacle. It exhibited 
a certain sameness, however, and by nine o clock there 
was considerable animation in the Place Crillon, where 
there is nothing to be seen but the front of the theatre 
and of several cafes in addition, indeed, to a statue 
of this celebrated brave, whose valor redeemed some 
of the numerous military disasters of the reign of 
Louis XV. The next morning the lower quarters of 
the town were in a pitiful state; the situation seemed 
to me odious. To express my disapproval of it, I lost 
no time in taking the train for Orange, which, with its 
other attractions, had the merit of not being seated on 
the Rhone. It was my destiny to move northward; 
but even if I had been at liberty to follow a less un 
natural course I should not then have undertaken it, 
inasmuch as the railway between Avignon and Mar 
seilles was credibly reported to be (in places) under 
water. This was the case with almost everything but 
the line itself, on the way to Orange. The day proved 
splendid, and its brilliancy only lighted up the desola 
tion. Farmhouses and cottages were up to their middle 
in the yellow liquidity; haystacks looked like dull little 
islands; windows and doors gaped open, without faces; 
and interruption and flight were represented in the 
scene. It was brought home to me that the popula 
tions rurales have many different ways of suffering, 
and my heart glowed with a grateful sense of cockney- 
ism. It was under the influence of this emotion that 





I alighted at Orange, to visit a collection of eminently 
civil monuments. 

The collection consists of but two objects, but these 
objects are so fine that I will let the word pass. One 
of them is a triumphal arch, supposedly of the period 
of Marcus Aurelius; the other is a fragment, magnifi 
cent in its ruin, of a Roman theatre. But for these 
fine Roman remains and for its name, Orange is a 
perfectly featureless little town, without the Rhone 
which, as I have mentioned, is several miles distant 
to help it to a physiognomy. It seems one of the 
oddest things that this obscure French borough 
obscure, I mean, in our modern era, for the Gallo- 
Roman Arausio must have been, judging it by its 
arches and theatre, a place of some importance 
should have given its name to the heirs apparent of 
the throne of Holland, and been borne by a king of 
England who had sovereign rights over it. During 
the Middle Ages it formed part of an independent 
principality; but in 1531 it fell, by the marriage of 
one of its princesses, who had inherited it, into the 
family of Nassau. I read in my indispensable Mur 
ray that it was made over to France by the treaty of 
Utrecht. The arch of triumph, which stands a little 
way out of the town, is rather a pretty than an im 
posing vestige of the Romans. If it had greater purity 
of style, one might say of it that it belonged to the 
same family of monuments as the Maison Carree at 
Nimes. It has three passages, the middle much 
higher than the others, and a very elevated attic. 



  

The vaults of the passages are richly sculptured, and 
the whole monument is covered with friezes and 
military trophies. This sculpture is rather mixed; 
much of it is broken and defaced, and the rest seemed 
to me ugly, though its workmanship is praised. The 
arch is at once well preserved and much injured. Its 
general mass is there, and as Roman monuments go 
it is remarkably perfect; but it has suffered, in patches, 
from the extremity of restoration. It is not, on the 
whole, of absorbing interest. It has a charm, never 
theless, which comes partly from its soft, bright yellow 
color, partly from a certain elegance of shape, of ex 
pression; and on that well-washed Sunday morning, 
with its brilliant tone, surrounded by its circle of thin 
poplars, with the green country lying beyond it and a 
low blue horizon showing through its empty portals, 
it made, very sufficiently, a picture that hangs itself 
to one of the lateral hooks of the memory. I can 
take down the modest composition, and place it before 
me as I write. I see the shallow, shining puddles in 
the hard, fair French road; the pale blue sky, diluted 
by days of rain; the disgarnished autumnal fields; the 
mild sparkle of the low horizon; the solitary figure in 
sabots, with a bundle under its arm, advancing along 
the chaussee; and in the middle I see the little ochre- 
colored monument, which, in spite of its antiquity, 
looks bright and gay, as everything must look in 
France of a fresh Sunday morning. 

It is true that this was not exactly the appearance 
of the Roman theatre, which lies on the other side of 





the town; a fact that did not prevent me from making 
my way to it in less than five minutes, through a suc 
cession of little streets concerning which I have no 
observations to record. None of the Roman remains 
in the south of France are more impressive than this 
stupendous fragment. An enormous mound rises above 
the place, which was formerly occupied I quote from 
Murray first by a citadel of the Romans, then by a 
castle of the princes of Nassau, razed by Louis XIV. 
Facing this hill a mighty wall erects itself, thirty-six 
metres high, and composed of massive blocks of dark 
brown stone, simply laid one on the other; the whole 
naked, rugged surface of which suggests a natural cliff 
(say of the Vaucluse order) rather than an effort of 
human, or even of Roman labor. It is the biggest 
thing at Orange, it is bigger than all Orange put to 
gether, and its permanent massiveness makes light 
of the shrunken city. The face it presents to the town 
the top of it garnished with two rows of brackets, 
perforated with holes to receive the staves of the vela 
rium bears the traces of more than one tier of orna 
mental arches; though how these flat arches were 
applied, or incrusted, upon the wall, I do not profess 
to explain. You pass through a diminutive postern 
which seems in proportion about as high as the en 
trance of a rabbit-hutch into the lodge of the custo 
dian, who introduces you to the interior of the theatre. 
Here the mass of the hill affronts you, which the in 
genious Romans treated simply as the material of their 
auditorium. They inserted their stone seats, in a 



  

semicircle , in the slope of the hill , and planted their 
colossal wall opposite to it. This wall, from the inside, 
is, if possible, even more imposing. It formed the 
back of the stage, the permanent scene, and its 
enormous face was coated with marble. It contains 
three doors, the middle one being the highest, and 
having above it, far aloft, a deep niche, apparently 
intended for an imperial statue. A few of the benches 
remain on the hillside, which, however, is mainly a 
confusion of fragments. There is part of a corridor 
built into the hill, high up, and on the crest are the 
remnants of the demolished castle. The whole place 
is a kind of wilderness of ruin; there are scarcely any 
details; the great feature is the overtopping wall. This 
wall being the back of the scene, the space left be 
tween it and the chord of the semicircle (of the audi 
torium) which formed the proscenium is rather less 
than one would have supposed. In other words, the 
stage was very shallow, and appears to have been ar 
ranged for a number of performers standing in a line, 
like a company of soldiers. There stands the silent 
skeleton, however, as impressive by what it leaves you 
to guess and wonder about as by what it tells you. 
It has not the sweetness, the softness of melancholy, 
of the theatre at Aries; but it is more extraordinary, 
and one can imagine only tremendous tragedies being 
enacted there, 

"Presenting Thebes or Pelops line." 
At either end of the stage, coming forward, is an 


immense wing, immense in height, I mean, as it 
reaches to the top of the scenic wall; the other dimen 
sions are not remarkable. The division to the right, 
as you face the stage, is pointed out as the green 
room; its portentous altitude and the open arches at 
the top give it the air of a well. The compartment 
on the left is exactly similar, save that it opens into 
the traces of other chambers, said to be those of a 
hippodrome adjacent to the theatre. Various fragments 
are visible which refer themselves plausibly to such an 
establishment; the greater axis of the hippodrome would 
appear to have been on a line with the triumphal 
arch. This is all I saw, and all there was to see, of 
Orange, which had a very rustic, bucolic aspect, and 
where I was not even called upon to demand break 
fast at the hotel. The entrance of this resort might 
have been that of a stable of the Roman days. 



XXXVII. 

I HAVE been trying to remember whether I fasted 
all the way to Macon, which I reached at an advanced 
hour of the evening, and think I must have done so 
except for the purchase of a box of nougat at Monte- 
limart (the place is famous for the manufacture of 
this confection, which, at the station, is hawked at the 
windows of the train) and for a bouillon, very much 
later, at Lyons. The journey beside the Rhone 
past Valence, past Tournon, past Vienne would 



  

have been charming, on that luminous Sunday, but 
for two disagreeable accidents. The express from 
Marseilles, which I took at Orange, was full to over 
flowing; and the only refuge I could find was an 
inside angle in a carriage laden with Germans, who 
had command of the windows, which they occupied 
as strongly as they have been known to occupy other 
strategical positions. I scarcely know, however, why 
I linger on this particular discomfort, for it was but 
a single item in a considerable list of grievances, 
grievances dispersed through six weeks of constant 
railway travel in France. I have not touched upon 
them at an earlier stage of this chronicle, but my re 
serve is not owing to any sweetness of association. 
This form of locomotion, in the country of the ameni 
ties, is attended with a dozen discomforts; almost all 
the conditions of the business are detestable. They 
force the sentimental tourist again and again to ask 
himself whether, in consideration of such mortal an 
noyances, the game is worth the candle. Fortunately, 
a railway journey is a good deal like a sea voyage; 
its miseries fade from the mind as soon as you arrive. 
That is why I completed, to my great satisfaction, 
my little tour in France. Let this small effusion of 
ill-nature be my first and last tribute to the whole 
despotic gare: the deadly salle d attente, the insuffer 
able delays over one 's luggage, the porterless platform, 
the overcrowded and illiberal train. How many a 
time did I permit myself the secret reflection that it 
is in perfidious Albion that they order this matter 


best! How many a time did the eager British mer 
cenary, clad in velveteen and clinging to the door of 
the carriage as it glides into the station, revisit my 
invidious dreams! The paternal porter and the re 
sponsive hansom are among the best gifts of the Eng 
lish genius to the world. I hasten to add, faithful 
to my habit (so insufferable to some of my friends) of 
ever and again readjusting the balance after I have 
given it an honest tip, that the bouillon at Lyons, 
which I spoke of above, was, though by no means an 
ideal bouillon, much better than any I could have 
obtained at an English railway station. After I had 
imbibed it, I sat in the train (which waited a long 
time at Lyons) and, by the light of one of the big 
lamps on the platform, read all sorts of disagreeable 
things in certain radical newspapers which I had 
bought at the book-stall. I gathered from these sheets 
that Lyons was in extreme commotion. The Rhone 
and the Saone, which form a girdle for the splendid 
town, were almost in the streets, as I could easily be 
lieve from what I had seen of the country after leav 
ing Orange. The Rhone, all the way to Lyons, had 
been in all sorts of places where it had no business 
to be, and matters were naturally not improved by
