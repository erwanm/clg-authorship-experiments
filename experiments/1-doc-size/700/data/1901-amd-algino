city later on, but seemed now one vast jumble, after 
orderly Amsterdam. 

The Mary Ann was safely moored. There were some 
troublesome preliminaries to be gone through with. 
And now the sun was slanting low in the western 
heavens, losing itself behind the great mountains still to 
be explored, and the river began to gleam like a sinuous 
golden band between the verdurous shores. Then a cold 
wind blew up from the Gulf, and the convent bells began 
to chime. How soft and sweet it sounded ! — the call 
to vespers. Suddenly an army of flags were run up to 
the masthead, colors of many nations. 

'‘Oh, how beautiful it all is ! And look at the bowed 
heads ! It makes one almost envy the Catholics,” ex- 
claimed Angel ique, deeply touched. 

It did seem wonderful that among that bedlam of din 
there should be an instant halt and reverence. Men and 
women crossed themselves, responded softly ; then the 
labor of life went on like a great ocean wave rolling 
back. 

"It is a marvellous sight,” replied Gervaise, as his eyes 
wandered slowly about. "One can hardly believe it 
real.” 

Sylvie had tight hold of Angelique’s hand. 

"Oh, look at the little black children,” she cried, breath- 
lessly. "Are they the Indians? And what makes their 
hair grow in little tails ? And see those dancing ! O that 
cruel man, to strike them with his lash !” 

A man with a broad-brimmed hat and a long horse- 
whip in his hand had scattered a group of merry 
youngsters that made the air resound with their howls 
and cries. He was cleating a way in the muddy street 
for his wagon. 

Captain Strong came up to them. 





“You will not care to stay all night on the boat in the 
noise and the smell of everything. Your boxes will be 
safe in the cabin. You may lock it in and take the key. 
Neither will you like the lodging house; that is well 
enough for the men. I will send someone with you 
where you will be comfortable for the night. It is a 
Madame Milhet in Dauphine Street, something of a walk, 
but a nice, quiet place.” 

“We shall not stay here. Monsieur Strong. We shall 
push on — to some place,” and Barbe knitted her brows 
a little. “Yes, we shall be glad of a refuge to-night. 
And you have been so good, Monsieur.” 

“Who wouldn’t be good, as you call it, to such un- 
fortunate castaways ! But then — I have heard worse 
pirate stories than yours. And I don’t see how your 
young girl escaped their clutches, even by playing off 
ill,” and a quizzical sort of smile crossed his weather- 
beaten face. “Yes, you have much to be thankful for.” 

“We are, M’sieur,” and she bowed her head. 

“Mere Milhet will be very good to you. She is 
French, not Spanish nor mixed,” and he laughed a little, 
thinking how proud and tenacious these French people 
were ! Already American blood began to show the 
peculiar cosmopolitanism that was to make them at ease 
with all nations, while not less proud of their birthright. 

One of the sailors was deputed to accompany them. 
They left the boat, walking over the long gang-plank 
that was like a raft, and picking a way through bales and 
boxes and barrels, and a swarming crowd that set Bar- 
bette almost wild with terror. She had Angelique by 
the arm, while Jaques picked up Sylvie, who clasped 
her arms tightly about his neck. The streets were narrow 
and muddy, and gutters were full of ill-smelling, stagnant 
water. There were scarcely no sidewalks. Booths and 




stores were closing for the night. There were rows of 
low houses, blackened by exposure to the weather and 
the indifference of their owners. It was growing rapidly 
dark, but here and there a light flared in a window, and 
there were sounds of mirth and revelry and wild French 
songs. Negresses thrust flowers in their faces, or from 
some corner cried hot eatables from which came a savory 
smell. 

Presently the crowd grew less, the houses wore a dif- 
ferent aspect. In some, where the heavy wooden shut- 
ters stood ajar, there were signs of home life and gay 
voices chattering. Then they turned into Dauphine Street, 
and here another change met them. The houses were 
detached; there were gardens and trees between, the air 
was fragrant with the sweetness that nightfall wooed 
from leaf and blossom. Most of the houses had an 
upper story with an overhanging balcony, vine-wreathed, 
and reviving one with its delicious odor. 

The man paused before a heavy batten door, with a 
fanlight above, guarded by iron bars. On one side was 
a heavy iron knocker, and this made the street resound 
with the force of his summons. 

A head looked out from above. “Who is there, and 
what is it you want?” asked a woman’s voice, in rather 
broken English. 

“It is Jack Dubois. I come from Captain Strong, who 
is just in. He begs you to take some French refugees 
for the night. They were caught by pirates and barely 
escaped by the skin of their teeth. He will answer for 
them.” 

“I will come down.” 

“The heavy bolt was pulled. The door was opened 
cautiously, as if still half in fear. 

“Oh, it is all right. Mere Milhet. The captain picked 





them up on an island where they had been set ashore. 
And he says you are not to be afraid. He had them two 
days.’’ 

The door opened wider. There was a sort of square 
vestibule, shut off by another strong door. Mere Milhet 
had hung her candle in the sconce at the side, but it 
hardly lighted the dark walls, that were of cypress wood, 
grown deeper by age. 

'‘There are many of you,” she said, with a little hesita- 
tion. “But Captain Strong is my very good friend. 
Yes, come in, Madame, M’sieu — ah, the petite dar- 
ling ” and she looked from one to the other of the 

women as if to trace relationship, as Gervaise stood Sylvie 
down on the stone floor. ' 

Barbette explained at a little length in French, inter- 
rupted now and then by Mere Milhet’s ejaculations. 

‘.‘Well, now that I have done my duty, I will report 
to the captain,” said their guide. “Some one will come 
for them in the morning ” 

“Why not find my own way down?” exclaimed 
Gervaise in eager tones. “Yes, Jaques and I will see 
to the luggage — what is left of it,” with a touch of irony 
in his tone. 

“Well, well, as you like.” The man touched his cap 
with his adieu. 

Mere Milhet led the way to the inner room, that was 
quite well furnished and spacious. A long wooden settee 
had a mattress covered with gay chintz and some 
cushions at either end. 

“Ah, what you must have endured !” she began. “The 
Gulf is infested with pirates who rendezvous in the 
islands about. And there are the privateers, little better, 
perhaps. Why must they prey on each other like wild 
beasts? There would be work enough; there is land to 





settle, but they take the goods of others continually. 
And there are horrible stories told — but. you must be 
tired and need refreshment. Lucie, Dolomine, get 
ready the table ! Will you follow me upstairs — to her 
guests. 

There were two side ells to the house, which left a sort 
of courtyard at the back, before the real garden began. 
Flowers and vines grew about everywhere, adding a 
hundred fragrances to the soft, clear air, so different 
from the sickening smells of the levee. In one ell was a 
large, long room with three single pallets in a row, each 
one covered with a snowy white quilt. The floor was 
bare, but scrubbed until it almost shone. Two or three 
queer old pieces of furniture, half desks and chests of 
drawers, an iron-bound, massive chest, several antique 
chairs, and a shelf on which stood a pair of odd pitchers 
and some silver candlesticks. On either side of the 
dressing-table hung an iron sconce. Madame lighted the 
candles. 

‘I can hardly tell — you are not the mother of both?’' 
glancing inquiringly at Barbette. 

"I must be mother to both now. This young girl, 
Angelique Saucier, has been orphaned from early years. 
Her relative, the Marquise de Brienne, took her. The 
little one was also related to Madame, on her mother’s side, 
and I was foster sister to her mother — the lovely young 
girl whose husband was killed in the war with Spain, and 
she soon followed him with a broken heart. The Mar- 
quise sent for Sylvie and myself, and we all lived in the 
old chateau. The Sieur Hugh came to Canada three 
years ago, and we have not heard from him of late. The 
Marquise fell ill with a lingering complaint. Nearly a 
year ago she died. And there was trouble in France ” 

'‘Horrible trouble ! The Spanish are our masters, 




Madame, but we do not forget we are French. The 
poor King and Queen ! And now, Madame, no one is 
safe. It is frightful ! People being rushed to the 
guillotine every day, innocent of any crime. What are 
these fiends? Surely they 'cannot be French. It must 
be some wild rabble that has descended upon them as 
did the Huns. There are emigrants coming all the time, 
glad to escape. They will build a new France. Even 
here — then, Madame, is it your pleasure to remain with 
your charges?” suddenly bringing herself back to her 
duties as hostess. “There is water and towels for re- 
freshment. And now I will provide for the gentlemen.” 

They were placed in the other wing, and were most 
grateful for so delightful a refuge. 

Sylvie ran to the window and peered out in the 
darkness. 

“It is like Brienne !” she cried, delightedly. “It is so 

sweet, and hark ” putting her dainty head on one 

side, “Music!” 

There was the tinkle of a guitar and a curious ac- 
companiment of a banjo that deepened the melody in 
several places. Then a soft, clear voice broke into song. 

“Oh, it is delightful I Barbe, I want to stay here 
always. I hate the ocean and the ships. I will never 
go in one again with the nasty, watery smell. And here 
it is so sweet ! See, there are stars coming out. There 
is a great golden one hanging down low. And the 
beautiful singing! Angel, why do you not sing any 
more ?” 

Angelique gave a short, unmirthful laugh. 

“One must be gay to sing,- and we have been so full 
of care ” 

“But you did sing for Captain Bolmer.” 

“And the pirates never asked me for a song.” 




'‘You were ill in the berth. That is why I will not go 
sailing any more. Are there pirates all over ?” 

“Oh, I hope not, my little dear.” 

“Are we very far from France?” 

“Thousands of miles.” 

“And shall I never see Philippe again?” mournfully. 
“And my beautiful doll ! You know I was going to ask 
Philippe to marry her.” 

A tall negress in a gay turban announced that supper 
was in readiness. 

They had bathed hands and faces and felt a little 
restored, but to Barbe it seemed as if she had never been 
clean since leaving Amsterdam. 

But the snowy cloth, the fragrant tea, the great piles 
of tropical fruit, and the generous elbow-room were en- 
chanting. Mina — this tall negress who carried herself 
like a queen was called Dolomine — waited upon them in 
a royal fashion. The lines of caste had been so broken 
in upon that they all sat down together. Barbette 
Champe was grave and well-bred enough for any lady, 
and though Jaques had hesitated at first upon putting 
himself on an equality with his young master, who might 
one day be lord of Brienne, dangers had brought them 
into close relationship as friends. 

Madame Milhet answered many of Gervaise’s ques- 
tions about New Orleans. It was plain to be seen that 
she did not love the Spanish domination. 

“Ah, M’sieu, we were basely sold to Spain by our own 
King,” the hostess said, with a long sigh. “People did 
explain that by force of war and treaty the King was 
compelled to give us up. At first we did not believe it. 
We were French to our heart’s core, although there were 
many Spanish even then. So a great meeting was called 
at Place d’Armes. Planters and merchants and gentle- 




men, and even the small farmers, arranged to appeal to the 
King. For it was rumored that with the coming of 
Spanish rule there would be a looking forward to the 
establishment of an inquisitor general here. My hus- 
band’s cousin, who was a rich merchant, was sent to 
Paris to plead for a restoration of the old relations. 
Then we waited and waited. Jean Milhet never saw the 
King — there was so much chicanery. Then came Don 
Antonio de Ulloa, the new Spanish Governor, and up 
went Spanish flags. The commerce with France and 
the West Indies was suppressed. There was talk of 
ruin everywhere. The French resolved to rise. Per- 
haps it was not wisely done, but some of us had a hope 
of founding a new French kingdom, or colony of some 
kind, that should be independent. What right had the 
King to trade us off?” 

Mere Milhet was past sixty now. With years she had 
grown to ample proportions. Ider eyes were black and 
sparkling when she was excited, but, with the general 
softening effect of time, they too had softened in repose. 
Her dark olive skin was clear, her features quite regular, 
though the nose had broadened out a little. Her cheeks 
still had a girlish pink, unless the infrequent indulgence 
in temper flamed them to a vivid red. 

“Was it the King — really ? That was Louis XV.” 

“Yes. They barricaded the Governor’s house. They 
ran up the French flag, they filled the air with shouts for 
the King, and enjoined the Governor to leave the colony 
at once. Then they sent messengers to the courts of 
France and Spain. The plan for a republic was formed. 
If we had possessed wise and far-sighted men like the 
American colonies when they made their brave struggle, 
— but, perhaps it was too soon. It was in July ’69 that 
the Spaniards reached our great river in overwhelming 




force. Everybody was filled with dismay. Don Alex- 
andro O’Reilly, with twenty-six hundred troops, landed 
and took formal possession in the name of the King of 
Spain.” 

'‘But I would have fought to the death !” cried the boy, 
interested beyond measure. “Did they not even strike 
one blow ?” 

“My husband thought it was because they had no 
responsible head that they had temporized too long. 
Clearly resistance would have been useless. The brave 
Lafreniere made a manly address and proffered the 
homage of the people. But it was of no avail. He and 
many of the other leaders were arrested and sentenced 
to be hanged, but even the Spanish officials joined the 
colonists in beseeching that they might at least have a 
more honorable death. Lafreniere, Doyan, Caresse, 
Joseph Milhet, and Marquis were shot ; most of the others 
were sent to Morro Castle, Havana, and when they 
were released they were expatriated from Louisiana. 
The old Council was swept away; the Cabilda took its 
place. Then there were new offices made, and there was 
great pomp and ceremony attending them. But O’Reilly 
did not remain long. And then it was Uuzaga, and the 
new Spanish priests who tried to banish our good Father 
Dagobert. And the nuns’ schools were to teach Spanish, 
but they could not take from us our beloved French 
tongue with all their efforts. And, after all, O’Reilly 
was but a mongrel — not even a true Spaniard. But it 
is said, after his cruelty, he was excessively polite and 
urbane, and very fond of high society.” 

“Then you are not really French at all?” 

“Except in heart and soul, M’sieu. And some of us 
cherish a hope — but strange things happen in the world 
now.” 





“And France has no king. Oh, what will become of 
her!” 

“I have faith in France,” Mere Milhet said, proudly. 

Sylvie came around and leaned her golden head on 
Barbe’s shoulder, her eyes almost closed. 

“I am so sleepy,” she murmured. 

“The poor child ! And you are all tired ! I have talked 
twice too long.” 

“And I have not heard half enough. I am interested 
in your strange New Orleans,” declared Gervaise. 

Barbe took her charge upstairs and undressed her, 
and the little girl slept soundly among the fragrant roses. 


CHAPTER IV. 

“Oh, where are we ?” cried Sylvie, springing from her 
narrow bed. “Barbe — Angel I — did we leave the boat 
last night and have such a delicious supper, and was there 
some one who talked — and a tall black woman — or was 
I dreaming? I was so tired and sleepy. Oh yes, here 
is the window and the vines — and here is a wonderful 
bird, and look at the trees, and the roses and flowers that 
I do not know about. Is it really New Orleans? And 
where is the rest of America ?” 

Angelique laughed at the child’s eargerness. She, too, 
felt refreshed. 

There was a tap at the door. Sylvie ran. 

“Oh, here is a great bucket of water,” she exclaimed. 
“Did it drop down from the clouds, think?” 




“Doesn’t water generally drop down from the clouds?” 
queried Angelique. 

“But not by the bucketful.” 

“Well, I am not so sure about that; I have seen it 
come down in torrents,” said Barbe. 

“But there wasn’t any bucket unless you set one out 
to catch the water,” returned the child, archly. 

“Come and let me make your toilette. It is so long 
since we have lived in any Christian fashion.” 

“It seems years and years since we left Brienne,” and 
Angelique gave a little sigh, not that she wished herself 
back. And yet those last days were so strange that she 
continually asked herself if the events had really taken 
place? Was Hugh de Brienne truly and lawfully 
married ? 

Sylvie looked fresh as a rose. She ran downstairs 
without waiting to ask whether it was right or not. In 
fact, she seemed like a bird suddenly released. A big girl 
she had not seen the night before was filling vases with 
flowers. She was not dark like the other women, and 
she wore no turban, though a great coil of braids was 
wound over the top of her head. 

“So,” she began in pretty French, curiously softened, 
“you are the little girl who was taken by pirates? And 
you come from France?” 

“Yes, and from many other places. I think I must 
have been nearly all round the world.” 

“But it is a very big world. And there are great 
cities and kingdoms over East. The Americans have one, 
though they began by calling their king a president. 
That is all wrong. And they have the queer English 
language, which is barbarous. Then, the English drove 
us out of Canada. I hate them !” 





She stamped her foot and her eyes flashed. 

Sylvie look amazed. 

“It was my mother’s people. We were Acadians. 
And France had so much of this New World ! It was 
New France; it would have been a splendid world, and 
no barbarous talk but the Indians’. They had no right 
to come and drive us out — send us away from the homes 
we had made.” 

“Oh,” cried Sylvie, “then we are something alike. I 
left the old France. I don’t know why — it was because” 
— her small brow knitted with thought — “we were to be 
taken to a convent, I believe.” 

“Oh, I was not born then. And my mother married 
and died. And my father went away somewhere, and 
has not come back. Mere Richard had me and she beat 
and starved me, and I ran away. Then Nannete took 
me. She is a free woman and keeps a cake shop down 
by the wharf. It was not good for me, and Mere Milhet 
took me. But I think I shall become a nun. I go to 
school at the convent. I like the Sisters.” 

“Then you are a Catholic?” 

“A Catholic of course. What should I be? There is 
only one true Church.” 

“And I am a — a Huguenot.” Sylvie held up her head 
very straight, though she had a faint misgiving as to 
whether she was on the true side. 

The girl shook her head doubtfully. “I will ask at 
the convent ; the Sisters must know. You are too pretty 
to be a — to be an infidel! And French, too, although 
you talk not quite like us, a little more strong — harsh, 
that is it. Now I must finish my flowers. Mere Milhet 
will soon be home from mass, and then breakfast, and I 
go to the convent, where I stay all day.” 




She darted off, but Sylvie followed her. “Oh!” the 
child ejaculated, stopping suddenly as something blue 
and glistening and beautiful rose before her. 

“That is the heron. Oh, he is tame enough. Come, 
Piti. But I have no crumbs for you. Let the little girl 
stroke your neck. Your name is Sylvie?” 

“How did you know ?” with a bright smile. 

“I heard them talking of you this morning. I had 
broken a rule yesterday and I had to say ten pater nostcrs 
by myself in the dark and then go to bed. So I did not 
see you. Stroke his neck, Sylvie. Piti Patty, this is a 
nice little girl.” 

“Oh, what a funny name !” Sylvie put her small hand 
half fearfully on the bird’s beautiful neck that seemed 
to change to every shade of blue. 

“When he was little. Mini found him with a broken 
leg. She set it, and when he began to go about on the 
bare floor he went pit-a-pat in such a queer way. Sylvie 
will give you some crumbs after breakfast. Then he 
will love you and follow you about.” 

“I don’t know your name,” Sylvie said, half bashfully. 

“It is Laure Gorgas. When I become a nun I shall 
have a grand new name. It will be Annunziata, or 
Angelique or Veronique.” 

“Oh, Angelique is my cousin’s name.” 

“And the young man — is he her brother or yours?” 

“No, he is a cousin, too.” 

“He is very handsome. He was walking in the 
garden. I wish I had 2 cousin like that. I have no 
one,” with a longing, regretful intonation. 

“Oh, I am so sorry for you,” cried Sylvie, sympa- 
thetically. 

“And his name — is it a pretty one?” 

“It is Gervaise Aubreton.” 





Laure nodded. “But I think I like Henri better. 
Hortense de Longpre has a brother Henri. He is 
handsome too, and has such a sweet voice. Oh, what 
am I saying? I must not talk about young men. Pere 
Moras will give me a penance.” 

“What is a penance ? Susanne, at Brienne, used to talk 
of them. They are something bad — a punishment. But 
I would not like to be punished for talking of Gervaise. 
And Captain Strong was so good.” 

“That is different when they belong to you.” 

Laure had been snipping off an armful of flowers. 
Sylvie and the heron followed. Just as they passed by 
a waving cypress-tree, Gervaise met them. 

“This is Laure,” said the child, with a graceful turn of 
the hand. “And this is my Cousin Gervaise.” 

Laure turned red and her eyes drooped. Sylvie’s 
cheek was suddenly scarlet as well, and she glanced 
timidly up to Gervaise, who was praising the garden and 
the flowers. Now the girl turned into a wider walk 
that led straight up to the broad sort of porch covered 
with a latticework of vines that made the entrance to the 
breakfast room, where Lucie, who was almost as fair as- 
Laure, but had crispy, waving hair, was arranging the 
table. 

“Laure ! Laure !” said the voice of Mere Milhet, 
sharply. “Where have you been loitering so? The 
flowers should have been done long ago.” 

Mere Milhet had an odd little cap on her head, her 
prayer-book and her beads in her hand. 

“The little girl came out into the garden and I could 
not hurry as usual. She asked me so many things. 
And about Piti. She was afraid at first.” 

Gervaise had fallen back ; Sylvie stood uncertain. 

“Go about your business,” said Madame, peremptorily. 




“Sylvie caught her hand. “Oh, Madame, do not scold 
her,” she pleaded in a soft tone. “It was so nice to find 
her in the beautiful garden. It seems a little like Brienne, 
only smaller and more flowers, I think. And there were 
great woods.” 

“There are great woods all about here too, and further 
north, forests impenetrable. Over to the westward no 
one knows, but it is said to be a land of gold.” 

“I should not like to live always on the ocean,” said 
Sylvie, irrelevantly. “There are no flowers and birds, 
and nothing to walk on but the deck of the ship that rolls 
so it tires one’s feet. I like this strange city. I wonder 
if we cannot live here always?” 

Madame smiled. “Thou art a dear little girl,” she 
said, with emotion. “And I am glad you like our city.” 

“And Piti — could I have a crumb of bread for him ?” 

“Oh, yes. Lucie, bring hither some bread. Why, he 
is already acquainted with you,” smiling in a gratified 
way. 

“There were swans at Dessiers. I used to feed them 
with Philippe. And we had a great peacock, with such a 
beautiful tail ! Only he was cross and would not spread 
it when you bade him; no, not even for bread, which he 
would snatch out of your hand and run away.” 

Lucie brought the bread, and Piti’s manners were 
admirable. He rubbed his neck on the little hand as if 
in acknowledgment. Gervaise came forward and wished 
Madame a polite good-morning, and Dolomine appeared 
to announce that breakfast was waiting and the ladies 
ready. 

“I was detained a little. There was a very poor 
woman, with some children, whose husband went over 
into the colonies, and she had heard nothing from him. 
They know not where to go. Good Father Charlier took 




them in hand. Good-morning ladies/’ as the two guests 
entered the breakfast-room “Excuse me one moment.” 

She laid her beads and her prayer-book in a drawer, 
took off her cap, and put on a lace head-dress. Her hair 
was beginning to be plentifully sprinkled with white, 
and the cordiality in her face was most attractive. It 
seemed very homelike to the travellers after all their 
adventures, and the softened French fell on their ears 
like music. And oh, the fragrance of the flowers every- 
where; the vista of the garden, where the sun seemed to 
make a shower of golden drops and quivers through the
