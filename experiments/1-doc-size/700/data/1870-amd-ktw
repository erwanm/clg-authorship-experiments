Katliie was off like a flash. 

“ I thought you weren’t ever coming,” Charlie ex- 
claimed, for he had begun to grow impatient. “ But 


 


I ’m so glad. Now, Dolly, we ’ll be off in a 
trice.” 

Mrs. Alston bundled lier sister up nice and warm, 
and Charlie helped her into the sleigh with the air of 
a gentleman. Jessie took a seat behind her, saying, 
“ We ’ll put Kathie in front to keep off the wind ” ; at 
which Charlie laughed. 

There was Kathie in her scarlet and white hood, 
looking pretty enough for any fairy in the land. 
Charlie tucked her in with a soft blanket and drew 
up the wolf-skin. 

“ I suppose Charlie drives a good deal,” Aunt Ruth 
said. The first dash rather started her. 

“ O yes. Papa trusts him with all our horses 

except one. We have a very fiery fast horse that 
is rather beyond Charlie.” 

“ You won ’t mind if we go fast ; will you. Aunt 
Ruth ? ” Kathie asked, after she and Charlie had been 
indulging in a whispered consultation. 

“ No ” ; and Aunt Ruth smiled. She was begin- 
ning to feel quite courageous. 

Dolly pricked up her ears, shook her glossy mane, 
and started off, skimming over the snow like a bird. 
The roads were in a very fine condition, and the air 


 


keen and bracing without the sting of the coldest 
days. A faint pink came to Aunt Ruth’s cheeks. 
Her memory went back to the time when she had 
been as young as Miss Jessie, and enjoying a happy, 
care-free life. Brave Brother Robert had been her es- 
cort in those days, — dear Rob sleeping somewhere 
under an Indian sky, the fortune lost, and generous- 
hearted Fred Alston dead. What changes there had 
been since Rob left them, ten years before ! 

Kathie was wild with delight. For children the 
present is all sufficient, and to see Dolly flying along, 
her slender legs looking like a mere thread, and 
hear Charlie Darrell’s pleasant voice, was enjoyment 
enough. The warm blood seemed to race from pulse 
to pulse, her heart beat rapidly with her great joy, 
and the fresh wind made her rosy cheeks rosier than 
ever. Down the south went the sun, and presently 
dropped out of sight. They were homeward bound. 
Miss J essie took good care that Aunt Ruth should be 
comfortable. 

“ Hasn’t it been splendid!” ejaculated Kathie, in 
a breathless fashion. “O Miss Jessie, I ’m so 
thankful ! ” 

“ And I am very glad to have given you so much 
pleasure. Some time we will try it again.” 


 


Charlie thought that he. would like to have Kathie 
know how much of the plan was his, but he didn’t 
see any good way of telling it. 

So they were both helped out, and Rob was there
to receive them. He had half a mind to drive back 
with Charlie, but on the whole he concluded it was 
best to resist the temptation, as his mother was pre- 
paring supper. 

Kathie was in the gayest spirits, praising the 
ride, the horse, and most of all Miss Jessie. 

“ I say,” put in Fred, rather aggrieved, “ it ’s real 
mean that you didn’t take me. I could have 
crowded down in the. blankets.” 

“ But you weren’t here, Fred.” 

“Well, you might have waited a teeny little while. 
I did come home real soon.” 

“ Hush, Fred,” said his mother. “ Kathie had noth- 
ing to do with it except to go when she was asked.” 
Aunt Ruth was quite tired, and after supper lay on 
the lounge. Kathie caught sight of the unfinished 
work, and her tender conscience smote her. 

“ Mamma,” she began, “ I meant to help you sew 
this afternoon, and I ran off and forgot all about 


 


“ I didn’t expect you to stay at home ; indeed, I 
should not have allowed you to.” 

“ Rut the forgetting, mamma, and when I am try- 
ing so hard to remember ! ” Kathies eyes filled with 
tears. 

“ Never mind, my dear ; I don’t know as any one 
ever becomes so perfect as always to think of every- 
thing.” 

“ But I ’ll sew now.” 

“ No, Kathie, it isn’t worth while. After being 
out in the wind for so long you ’ll soon find yourself 
getting sleepy. I ’ll take the kind will for the deed.” 

After putting Fred to bed, Kathie drew a stool up 
to the lounge and talked to Aunt Ruth. Some way , 
the conversation turned upon the lost Uncle Robert. 

Kathie had heard the story many times before, but 
to-night it seemed to interest her specially. 

“ Don’t you believe he ever will come back ? ” 
Kathie asked, earnestly. “ Wouldn’t it be nice if 
some day he took us all by surprise, and came home 
rich as Mr. Darrell ? ” 

Aunt Ruth sighed. “ That will never be, dear. 
Robert wasn’t the man to forget his sisters so man}' 
years.” 


 


“ But you never heard that he was dead ? ” 

“ True, only we know if he had been living he 
would have written.” 

Kathie wanted to be a fairy more than ever, and 
bring Uncle Robert back in some queer way that 
would astonish them all. And then she wondered if 
he was like Brother Bob or Charlie Darrell What 
a dear, lovely afternoon it had been ! How delightful 
it was to be well and have pleasant things happen to 
you, and — There was a rosy mist before Kathie’s 
eyes and a weight settling upon her brain. Over 
came the little head on Aunt Ruth’s arm. 

“ I am sleepy, sure enough,” said Kathie, with a 
little laugh. “ I guess I ’ll go to bed. Good night, 
mamma; good night, dear Aunt Ruthie. Let’s all 
pray that God will send Uncle Robert back.” 

How many vain prayers had passed Aunt Ruth’s 
lips ! Yet Kathie’s sweet, cheery voice seemed to stir 
hope again. 

“ What a comfort the child is ! ” she said to Mrs. 
Alston. “ For her sake I wish we were more pros- 
perous. I sometimes wonder how you will get them 
all educated.” 

“We must trust in God,” Mrs. Alston replied. 


 


“ And not worry about the bridge until we have to 
cross it. But poor Bob ! I wonder if he found any 
friends at the last.” 

“Let us hope that he did,” was the tremulous 
reply. 

At times life seemed a hard burden indeed to Mrs. 
Alston. Her husband had died after a short illness, 
just as he was beginning to prosper, and when Freddy 
was but a month old. To this shock succeeded a long 
and severe illness, and when she was able to resume 
her place once more, it was but to hear of fresh mis- 
fortunes. The income that had been left to Buth and 
herself from her father’s property was swept away by 
a financial reversion, and they found themselves nearly 
penniless. Mr. Alston’s partner offered them, in lieu 
of money, a house in a pretty country town, which he 
represented as likely to increase in value, and elo- 
quently set forth the advantages of having a home ; 
and just then, feeling that it made no difference to 
her where she went, she accepted his proposal. In 
the mean while Buth had a severe and dangerous fall, 
which was likely to leave her a cripple for life. Dis- 
couraged to the uttermost, it was with a heavy heart 
that Mrs. Alston removed to Brookside. Here a fresh 


 


disappointment awaited her. The house was old and 
out ot repair, and she was indeed a stranger in a 
strange land. If she could have sold again, she would 
have returned immediately to the city, where she had 
some friends ; but that was quite impossible. She had 
parted with her most valuable furniture, so with the 
remnants she tried to give the place a homelike look. 
Ruth recovered slowly, and Mrs. Alston soon found 
that her small income would not support them all. 
She could think of nothing but sewing, and she man- 
aged to earn considerable by this, while Ruth did em- 
broidering and various kinds of needlework. They 
did not want for any of the necessaries of life, but 
they had not many of its luxuries. 

Since their arrival in Brookside they had not heard 
from their brother, who had gone to China some three 
years before. He had rambled about considerably, 
their last news of him being dated at Bombay, and 
Mrs. Alston knew at once that he had missed a letter 
from Rutli detailing their misfortunes. Several times 
afterward they sent letters to him, but no answers ever 
came. And now little Freddy was eight years old, 
— eight years of sorrow, care, and trouble. 

This was not all. There was a future to be con- 



sidered. Rob was nearly fourteen, a smart, bright 
fellow, but rough, impatient, and thoughtless. In 
another year it would be necessary for him to go at 
some kind of business, and in this little town there 
was nothing scarcely to do. Must she send him away 
from home, or would another removal have to take 
place ? Often did she ponder these things, never 
reaching any definite conclusion for some trusty 
friend to advise and comfort ! She had been out of 
the world so long that she scarcely knew how to take 
an important step. 

She thanked God in her prayers that night for 
womanly little Kathie, the comfort of her weariest 
hours, and she tried to trust for the dark future that 
she could not see. 

But Kathie, young and bright and cheerful, was not 
troubled with anxious forebodings. Only she could 
not help thinking that it would be very pleasant and 
comfortable to have a pretty house and plenty of 
money. If mamma could dress up and be a lady, for 
she was as pretty as anybody, and if Freddy could 
have a play-house full of toys, and Rob all the boats, 
dogs, turning-poles, and various other things that he 
wanted, how happy they would all be ! 


 


But these items could not be had without money, 
and there was no way to get it until Bob grew to be 
a man. 

Bob was wild to be a sailor. He passed by Kathie’s 
fairy-books with a disdainful smile, and turned his 
attention to wonderful adventures or sea voyages. 
Sometimes being an Indian hunter quite divided his 
regard, but he generally came back to his first love. 
How much these desires pained his mother’s heart he 
never knew. 

A few days after the ride Mrs. Thomas called with 
her embroidery. She was a young and pretty woman, 
quite chatty and agreeable. Aunt Buth’s needlework 
delighted her. She mentioned the price she had been 
used to paying, “ but it wasn’t done as handsomely 
as yours,” she said, “ and yours is worth more. It 
will be quite a treat to have such beautiful work.” 

“ I heard that you did plain sewing, Mrs. Alston,” 
she went on, “ and I have a great pile of sheets and 
pillow-cases to make up. Having a little baby, I can’t 
find time for much myself, so if you are not very busy, 
I think I ’ll send them over to you.” 

Mrs. Alston expressed her readiness to take them. 

“ Quite a bright rift in the clouds,” said Aunt Butli 


 


when they were alone. “ Katliie, I do believe that 
we shall be able to have a new parlor carpet in the 
spring.” 

“ I ’ll do all I can to help,’ was Kathie’s delighted 
rejoinder. 




ROB’S GIANTS. 

One day Eob came home with what he declared to 
be a splitting headache. His face was flushed, his 
temples throbbing, and there wasn’t a spot in his 
whole body but what pained. 

“ You must have taken a dreadful cold,” his mother 
said. “ I hope you are not going to be sick.” 

“ Just let me lie down on the lounge and be quiet,” 
was all lie could say. 

She bathed his feet and put on mustard draughts, 
gave him some hot tea, and tied a napkin round his 
head wet with vinegar and water. So there he lay 
turning and tumbling about and wishing he could 
sleep. 

Poor Eob ! By morning his fever was higher, and 
Kathie was sent for the doctor. 

“ A touch of bilious fever,” said Dr. Page. “ He is 
a good deal out of order and has taken a severe 
cold.” 


 


“ But do you think it will prove dangerous ? ” 

“ Oh no. He will be about again in a fortnight.” 

So Mrs. Alston had Rob’s bed brought down to the 
parlor and a fire made there. Aunt Ruth watched 
him during the day, and his mother took care of him 
at night. 

Kathie had a double share of work, — all the er- 
rands to do, coal to bring in, kindling-wood to split, 
and to amuse Fred, who hung after her continually, 
as there was no wonderful Rob to follow about. 

For a week Rob was pretty sick. He didn’t take 
much notice of any one, but tossed about restlessly, 
and wondered if he never should be cool again ; but 
after a while he grew more tranquil, and began to 
think of something to eat. His mother toasted him a 
piece of bread. 

He chewed with very long teeth, as people say 
After two or three mouthfuls he said, slowly, “ Mother,
isn’t this bread a little bitter ? ” 

“No,” she answered; “it is because you are still 
feverish.” 

“ I ’d like a drink of cold tea, I believe.” 

But that didn’t quite come up to the mark either. 
" I wonder if soup wouldn’t be better ? ” 


 


“ Perhaps so. When the butcher comes I ’ll get a 
piece of meat and make you some nice broth.” 

Eob thought of the broth for the next three hours. 
It had such an appetizing fragrance that he was sure 
it would taste good. Alas for his hopes ! 

“ Did you put in any salt ? ” he asked, languidly, 
after he had taken a few spoonfuls. 

“ Yes, it is very well seasoned,” replied his mother. 
It wasn’t quite right, however. 

“ I wish you ’d put in some more,” he said presently. 
Mrs. Alston obeyed his behest. 

“ And some more pepper.” 

“ Pepper isn’t very good, Eob.” 

“ But a little wouldn’t hurt me.” 

Eob was so weak that he felt babyish, and when 
his mother saw the slow tears coming in his eyes 
she yielded against her better judgment. 

He managed to swallow a little, then lie turned to 
his pillow again. 

“ Mother,” he said, just as she was settled at her 
sewing, “ isn’t there some currant jelly ? ” 

“ Yes, Eob.” 

“ Couldn’t I have a taste ? You know I like bread 


and currant jelly so much.” 


 


His mother rose and went to the closet where she 
kept her preserves, uncovered the jar, and took out 
some. 

“ I ’ll just bring you the bread,” she exclaimed, 
“ and you can put it on or eat it alone.” 

She arranged a little tray on the bed and left Rob 
to help himself. 

Though bread and jelly might be royal for a hun- 
gry boy, it held no potent charm for him now. Then 
he tried it alone. That tasted quite good ; but now 
he was taken with a fit of thirst. 

“ Oh mother,” he began, “ don’t you know what nice 
drinks you used to make out of currant jelly and 
water? Won’t you fix me some?” 

Mrs. Alston had sewed about an inch. She waited 
upon her son again. 

“ That ’s real good, the best thing I ’ve had yet ! ” 
His smile, faint though it was, rewarded her. He 
sipped in a pleased fashion, declaring that it looked 
like wine. 

“ Mother,” about ten minutes after, “ don’t you think 
T could sit up a little while ? ” 

“ Why, yes, if you feel like it.” 

“ I believe I do.” 


 


She drew up the large rocking-chair, put a blanket 
over it and a pillow at the back. Then she helped 
Rob to get up, put him comfortably in and covered 
him nicely. 

“ That ’s splendid ! I feel as if my bones were ’most 
worn through. I ’ve been pretty sick ; haven’t I, 
mother ? ” 

“ Quite sick, Rob.” 

“ Any of the boys been to see me ? ” 

“ Oh yes, — Charlie Darrell, Harry Cox, and several 
of the others, and Dick Grayson too ; but you were 
a little delirious most of the time, so you couldn’t 
talk to them.” 

“ Was I ? What did I say ? ” Rob thought that 
quite an exploit. 

“ You built snow-houses, went sledding, played ball 
and marbles, and scolded Freddy.” 

“ Did I ? ” Rob smiled a little at that. “ But, 
mother, you don’t know what a bother Fred is. He 
thinks he must do just as the big boys do, and some- 
times I can’t stir without his being in my way. 
Seems to me little children ought always to play with 
girls.” 

“ Because girls have more patience, Rob ? ” 


 


A faint tinge of color came to Rob’s cheek. 

“ Well, not exactly that, mother, but boys are 


always running or doing something hard, and little 
ones get hurt.” 

“ All children are a good deal of care and trouble.” 

Rob felt quite sure that he wasn’t very much, but 
he began to grow tired of talking and couldn’t argue 
the point. 

“ I wish you ’d get my Robinson Crusoe, mother,” 
he said a few minutes after. 

There was a book-rack in the parlor, and each of 
the children had a shelf. His mother dropped her 
sewing and looked the books over. 

“ It isn’t here, Rob,” she said. 

“ Oh yes, it must be, mother. I always put it there,” 
he exclaimed, confidently. 

“ But it certainly is not here now.” 

“ Oh, I know ; I had it up stairs. It ’s on one of 
my shelves.” 

“ I think it isn’t best for you to read,” was his 
mother’s rejoinder. 

“ I don’t want to read, I only want to look at the 
pictures. It ’s so tiresome to sit here and do nothing.” 
The ready tears came again to Rob’s eyes. 


 


“ And you ’re quite sure it is up stairs ? ” 

“ O yes. I remember taking it one night when I 
went to bed. It had been lent to Jamie Hall.” 

So Mrs. Alston trudged up to Rob’s room. Ho 
Robinson Crusoe on the shelves or in the closet. 
Then she searched his box of odd traps with no 
better success. 

“ How long she stays ! ” he exclaimed, impatiently. 

“ I think you beep her pretty busy, Rob,” said 
Aunt Ruth. “ I don’t believe she has been quiet 
more than fifteen minutes at one time to-day.” 

“ Why, I haven’t asked her to do more than two or 
three things for me, and I ’m sure I’d a great deal 
rather be well and help myself,” replied Rob, in an 
injured tone. 

It would only fret him to argue the point, so Aunt 
Ruth kept the peace. 

Mrs. Alston returned in a little shiver. She had 
not expected to be detained so long, and had thrown 
nothing around her shoulders. Her face looked quite 
cold and blue. 

“ I couldn’t find it anywhere, Rob,” she said, going 
to the fire to warm her hands. 

“ Did you look in my little box ? ” 


 


" Yes, and in the closet. It isn’t in the room." 

“ But, mother, I am quite sure. Jamie brought it 
home. He put a blue paper cover on it, you know ” 

“ I believe I remember the circumstance, but you 
must have lent it again." 

" No, mother, I ’m sure I have n’t." 

“ I do not think it is in the house." 

“ But it must be,” said Rob, growing flushed and 
positive. “ It was my Christmas gift ! Oh dear ! if 
it ’s lost, — and so many splendid pictures in it 
too ! I never saw a Robinson Crusoe I liked half 
as well.” 

“ Maybe it will come to light some time. It can- 
not be lost unless you have mislaid it.” 

“ But I ’m sure I took care of it the last time I 
had it.” 

Katliie entered just then, bright and rosy. “ O, 
Rob, actually sitting up ! ” she exclaimed, gayly. 
“ Dear Rob ! Do you feel a good deal better ? 
But Oh, how white you look ! ” 

“ Oh, Rob ’s out of bed ! ” put in Freddy, loudly. 
“ Rob, are you all well ? Can’t you go out to play 
to-morrow ? ” 

“O Freddy, your voice goes through my head like 


 


ft trumpet. Mother, can’t you put me back to bed 
again ? I ’m getting tired.” 

Mother had just sat down and taken up her 
needle. She rose and obeyed her son’s request. 

“ The bed feels so good,” he exclaimed. “ Freddy, 
do keep still ! ” 

“ Get yourself good and warm, and you may go 
out to play a little while,” his mother said, gently. 

“ Oh Kathie,” began Fob again, “ haven’t you lent 
my Eobinson Crusoe to somebody ? Mother can’t 
find it anywhere. I wouldn’t have it lost for any- 
thing.” 

“ No, Eob, I haven’t had it. Let me see, — Janne 
Hall brought it home ? ” 

“ Yes, I ’m sure. It ’s gone, and some one has 
taken it away. It ’s real mean ! ” and poor Eob was 
getting excited. 

Kathie thought a moment or two. “ O Eob, I 
believe I know. The day you were taken sick you 
had it at school, drawing a picture out of it.” 

Eob looked perfectly amazed. It came over him 
like a flash. He hadn’t quite finished the man 
Friday, so he put the book in the corner of his desk 
He could see it all like a picture, 


 


“ Don’t you remember ? ” and Kathie glanced at 
him. Something in her bright eyes said “ Giants ” ; 
and Rob was filled with confusion. 

“ Yes,’ he rejoined, faintly, and then he lay very still. 

“ Kathie,” her mother said, “ I wish you ’d sew a 
little. I ’m quite behindhand.” 

A tear dropped from Rob’s eyes to the pillow. 
How much trouble and interruption he had caused 
his mother ! That about the book was altogether his 
own fault. How could he have been so careless as 
to forget ! He had worried himself too, for his head 
was beginning to ache, and little pains kept crawling 
down his back. And he couldn’t help thinking 
that he ought to fight giants as well as Kathie. 

“ I must try to remember,” he said to himself. 
There was quite a wet spot on the pillow ; and 
presently he turned his face over to the wall, and, 
being completely tired out, fell asleep. 

He little guessed how much pains they all took 
to keep quiet. Freddy didn’t think it much fun 
to play alone, and soon came in, and Aunt Ruth read 
him a story to keep him still. Kathie sewed indus- 
triously until twilight, and then went out to do a few 
errands. Fred desired to go, of course. At first 


 


Kathie wanted to object ; but then she thought it 
wouldn’t be much worse for her to be bothered with 
him than Aunt Kuth and mamma.
