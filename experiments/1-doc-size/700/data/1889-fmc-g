 

her for such a thought, which made her feel as though she were 
trying to lay down the responsibility that had fallen to her lot. 
Her untiring conscience took up the burden again, to bear it as it 
might. 

Rex must answer her, and upon his answer would depend 
everything. It was not an easy matter to question him, however, 
and for the present it was wholly impossible. She must meet Hilda 
while she herself was yet undecided, so that it seemed simplest 
to be roughly frank with the girl, to tell her plainly what had 
happened, what was known and the extent of what no one knew, 
showing her clearly that if old Greifenstein should turn out to have 
been guilty, she must give up all thought of Greif and submit to 
her poor lot with the best grace she could. Greif would go away 
and travel, perhaps for several years. He would find interests at 
last, which might help him to forget his darkened youth. Hilda 
and her mother would live as they could, and when the mother 
died Sigmundskron must go to the hammer. At all events it was 
not encumbered with debts, and its sale would leave the child a 
pittance to save her from starvation ; possibly she would have more 
than before, but Frau von Sigmundskron could not judge of that. 
Possibly, too, Hilda's sixty-four quarterings would help her to gain 
admittance as a lady-canoness in one of those semi -religious 
foundations, reserved exclusively for the old nobility, of which 
several exist in Germany. 

The short winter's day was over when Fran von Sigmundskron 
reached this stage in her meditations. Lights were brought to the 
room where she was, and a servant came to ask her what she would 
eat. She scarcely knew what she answered, but she remembered 
that some hours had passed since she had been to see Greif or 
Rex and she roused herself to go upon the errand of inquiry. In 
the corridor she was met by another person who came to ask 
about the dispositions for the morrow, an ominous creature in 
black, the sight of whom recalled at once the hideous realities of 
the day, from which her mind had wandered in her anxiety for 
Hilda's welfare. She gave the necessary directions and continued 
upon her way. 

' Come in,' said Greif's voice as she knocked cautiously at the 
door. 

As soon as she entered she saw that his state had been improved 
by the rest he had taken. His eyes were quiet, his colour pale but 
natural, his manner mournfully calm. In the morning she had 
feared he might fall into a delirious fever. 

Frau von Sigmundskron came and stood beside him. He was 



 

comforted by her presence, though he had not always been sure 
that he liked her. At present, he knew what good cause he had 
to be grateful to her for what she had done, and he felt that she 
was his only relation in the world, the only woman alive who 
could in any way take the place of what he had lost. If he had 
not been very fond of her before, it was because he had not under- 
stood her, and because in his eyes her personality was entirely 
eclipsed by Hilda's. He put out his hand and took hers, and 
pressed it gently. 

' You are very good,' he said. * I am glad you have come.' 

She sat down beside his easy-chair and gazed into the fire. 
There was no light in the room save that of the pine logs, blazing 
in the great chimney. Her reflexions of ten minutes earlier seemed 
very far away, for the sight of him and the sound of his voice had 
suddenly recalled those hopes for Hilda from which she had got so 
much happiness. 

'You have slept,' she said. ' I am glad, for you needed rest.' 

She did not know what to say, and there was a pause before 
she spoke again, during which Greif did not move. Unconsciously 
he had taken the manner of one ill, and lay back in his seat, his 
eyes half closed, his hands resting upon the arms of the chair, 
making no effort and only hoping that none would be required of him. 

' Dear Greif,' said the baroness at last, ' you will go away, will 
you not ? ' 

He started a little and his expression changed, as though the 
question pained him. 

'Yes,' he answered. ' I will go away when it is over.' 

' Shall it be to-morrow, then ? ' asked Frau von Sigmundskron 
very softly. 

' Yes. To-morrow morning. I would it were to-night. And 
then -' he stopped and passed his hand wearily across his fore- 
head, letting it drop nerveless by his side almost immediately. 

'And then r 

' Then I must see Hilda before I go.' His eyelids quivered, and 
his lips shut themselves closely. 

' Yes,' answered the baroness in a tone of hesitation. 

' Yes, I must see Hilda,' Greif repeated. * And when I am gone 
then then 

This time Frau von Sigmundskron said nothing, for she saw that 
he was suffering, though she dared not guess what was passing in 
his mind. He seemed to be trying to speak. 

' When I am gone ' he began, but the words died on hia 

lips. 


' Do not talk of this now, dear Greif.' 

He roused himself and sat straight in his chair. There was 
something of his father's look in his face, and his companion 
noticed that his fingers were strained as he grasped the carved wood 
in the effort to steady himself. 

' I must say it now,' he answered firmly. ' To-morrow I shall 
not be able to talk much, and it may happen that we shall never 
have another opportunity.' 

' Never ? ' 

' Perhaps never. It is to be good-bye. You must find another 
husband for Hilda, for I may not come back. That is what I 
wanted to say.' 

The baroness turned a startled look upon him and leant forwards 
toward him from her seat. She had not expected such a turn in 
the drama. 

' You do not suppose that I, an honourable man, would expect 
you to give your daughter to the son of a murderer ? ' 

The question was put so sharply and concisely that Frau von 
Sigmundskron was taken unawares. The thought had been 
painful enough when it had passed unspoken through the confusion 
of her reflexions, but Greif's statement gave it a new and horrible 
vividness. With a single sharp sob, she hid her face in her hands, 
and Greif saw that they trembled. His own heart was beating 
violently, for he had nerved himself to make the effort, but he had 
not anticipated the reaction that followed closely upon it. He felt 
as though, in pronouncing the detested word, he had struck his 
father's dead face with his hand. 

'God knows how I loved him,' he said, under his breath. 
' But he did the deed.' 

Frau von Sigmundskron did not distinguish the words he spoke, 
but she felt that she must say something. Her hands dropped 
from her strained and tearless eyes and fell upon her knees. 

'Oh, Greif! Greif!' she almost moaned, as she stared at the 
blazing logs. 

' That is what it comes to in the end,' he answered, summoning 
all his courage. ' I cannot marry Hilda. It was bad enough to 
be half disgraced by my father's brother you were kind enough 
to set that aside. It is worse now, for the stain is on the name 
itself. I cannot give it to Hilda. Would you have her called 
Greifenstein ? ' 

The baroness could not speak. Half an hour earlier she would 
not have dared to hope that Greif would himself renounce her 
daughter, but it was different now. She could not look upon his 



 

agonised face, and listen to the tones that came from his tortured 
heart, as he gave up all he held dear for the sake of acting honour- 
ably, she could not see his suffering and hear his words, and yet 
brutally admit that he was right, and that his sacrifice was a 
necessity. And yet her own conscience told her that her first 
thought must be for her own child, and not for him. She stared 
at the fire and answered nothing. 

'Would you have her write her name "Hilda von Greifenstein "V 
lie asked, forcing the words sternly from his lips. ' Would you 
have her angel purity darkened with the blood that is on my 
house ? ' 

' But you, Greif what will become of you ? ' 

' It matters little enough, so that I do no harm to those I love,' 
he answered. 

' It does matter,' said the baroness gently. ' It is not right or 
just that an innocent man should suffer for the deeds of others.' 

' It is right that he should suffer anything, rather than injure 
those who are not only innocent but free from inherited reproach.' 

There was a sudden energy in his manner which surprised his 
companion. His white face was illuminated by a sort of radiance 
from within, his voice was full and firm, the glance of his eyes 
piercing and determined. 

' It is right,' he continued, ' and I will do it, come what may. 
Indeed I must, for in spite of your kind heart and words you 
would not give her to me. But even if you would, I would not 
take her, I would not make her the mother of more Greifensteins. 
Ay you look at me I love her too much. That is the reason. 
If I loved her less oh, then, I would take her. I would take my 
beautiful Hilda for my own sake, and in her love I would try and 
forget the horrors of my younger years. I would forget, for my 
own sake, that my father was a murderer and a suicide, my 
father's brother a shameful traitor, myself a man clothed in the 
infamy of others, until the world can hardly distinguish between 
my innocence and their guilt. I could live with Hilda, somewhere 
in this lonely forest, and with her I might bury memory and talk 
lightly of love beside its very grave. And Hilda would be willing, 
too, and if I did not love her as I do, I would take her whether 
you would let her go or not no, forgive me I should not speak 
so to you, who are the best of women but you would consent, 
for you are so kind. But the thing is impossible. She would 
remember, and I should remember also, when our sons grew up 
and had to meet the world with the brand of our name upon their 
faces. Look at Kex. He is my best friend. Yesterday I learnt 



 

that he is my cousin. Even he has hidden his father's deeds 
under a common, meaningless name. How much more should 
I hide my head ! How much less right have I, than he had 
yesterday, to make an innocent girl, or any woman, the wife of a 
Greifenstein ! No go to Hilda, tell her the truth, let me see 
her once, and I will rid you of myself when I have said good-bye. 
You are her mother, and you alone can tell her all all except the 
last word, and when I have spoken that word, I will go away, Rex 
and I together, and you will not hear of me any more.' 

Greif ceased speaking. He had risen from his chair to pace the 
room while he spoke and he now stood with folded arms before the 
baroness, his eyes fixed on hers as though waiting for her answer. 
He was very young, and it was perhaps the first time in his life 
that he had spoken out before any one. He was too much excited 
to think whether his speech would sound theatrical and exaggerated 
or not. He meant every word of what he had said, and that was 
enough for him. He meant to do what was right and honourable, 
and that is enough for any man. 

Frau von Sigmundskron's gentle eyes fell before his fixed gaze. 
Feeling as she did, and remembering what she had felt when she 
had come to him, she was ashamed to meet his earnest glance. 
There were few better women in the world, few whose goodness 
showed itself so clearly both in deeds and intentions, and yet she 
was conscious, rightly or wrongly, that Greif was outdoing her in 
generosity. To her the words he had spoken had a ring of heroism 
in them, and he himself seemed to grow in dignity and strength 
as he stood before her. She hesitated, the speech came to her lips, 
failed, took courage and came again. Once more she raised her 
head and looked into his eyes. 

' Greif you are a brave man, and you will understand me,' she 
said. ' When I came here, I felt all that you have said. I felt 
it in the long night, before you were in the house. I meant to 
tell you what you have told me, as kindly as I could, not now, 
but later. It would have been hard, for I am more than fond 
of you.' 

'It would have been your duty, and it would have been right,' 
answered Greif calmly. 

The baroness laid her hand upon his folded arms. 

' It would not have been right, Greif,' she said in a low voice 
that trembled a little. ' It might have seemed so, for I did not 
know you as I know you now. You have done all that a man 
can do, more, perhaps, than almost any man would have done. I 
did not wrong you in what I felt, nor in what I meant to say, but 



 

I could never say it now. Take Hilda, and call yourself as you 
will, for you are worthy of her and neither you nor she will ever 
regret it.' 

Greif looked at her for a moment, and then knelt beside her 
and kissed her hands. 

'You will,' she said, and there were tears in her eyes. 

' I cannot,' he answered, in heartbroken accents. Then, rising, 
he stood and leaned against the chimney-piece and bowed his head 
against the carved wood. 

He could not feel as she did, and his nature was incapable of 
such a sudden revulsion as had taken place in her heart. He 
knew how bravely generous she had been, but her kindness changed 
nothing in the situation, beyond awakening in him a sense of heart- 
felt gratitude for which he had expected no such cause as she had 
given. The fear of doing an injury to Hilda was still foremost in 
his mind. He had said that eVen if her mother would consent, he 
would not take her, and what he felt when that consent was so 
unexpectedly thrust upon him was a measure of his earnestness. 

' Nothing is spared me,' he said, almost under his breath. ' Not 
even your generosity !' 

His action was to depend wholly upon his own free will, and 
he knew that it would have been far easier to renounce his love if 
Hilda's mother had helped him with her opposition. There she 
sat, offering him what he must not take, thrusting upon him that 
which his whole nature craved, and which his honour alone bid 
him refuse. Her sweet voice sounded like the soft music of 
temptation. 

'Do not say so, Greif,' she said. 'Remember that you are 
wholly innocent, and that Hilda loves you with all her heart and 
soul. Why must you force yourself to do what will make her and 
me so unspeakably wretched ? After all I take the most worldly 
argument it is for her and for me to decide. You have concealed 
nothing, and I know all, and if I say that your goodness and your 
heroism outweigh the rest, should you not be satisfied? And 
besides, you are young. You do not know how very quickly the 
world forgets. A score of years hence, who will remember the 
evil deeds of last night ? They, were not even done in a city, those 
who did them had hardly any acquaintances, and perhaps no friends. 
You yourself are not old enough to be known to many, and you 
can live here until your children are grown up. It seems to me 
that I was wrong even to have thought of separating you two, 
wholly wrong and mistaken and that I ought to ask your forgive- 
ness for my intention.' 





Thus she pleaded the cause of his own heart, giving many and 
good reasons why he should yield, while he stood struggling with 
himself and wishing that he could stop his ears against her persua- 
sion. To him the horror was more vivid than to her, and she 
could not understand his dread of associating Hilda with the curse 
that had fallen upon his house. 

' I cannot,' he said firmly, when she had ceased speaking. 

She rose and stood beside him. 

' Think of it, Greif/ she answered. ' You must not break her 
heart for a scruple of honour.' 

Then she went out softly, wondering at herself, but sure that 
she had done the best. 



CHAPTER XVI 

FEAU von Sigmundskron was too conscientious a person to omit 
a mental review of what had passed. She knew, indeed, that she 
had acted kindly and generously, if not wisely, and she believed 
that in some cases kindness might be better than wisdom. She 
was struck by one point in Greif s language. He assumed as a 
certainty that old Greifenstein had killed Clara, whereas the baroness 
had been inclined to attribute the crime to Rieseneck alone. At 
first she did not understand Greif's readiness to believe that this 
evil deed had been his father's, but presently, as she thought over 
the whole matter, it struck her that she had no reason for acquitting 
the one rather than the other, so far as evidence was concerned, 
but that she had wished Greif's father innocent for Greif's own 
sake. The good lady was much disturbed on rinding that her 
wishes had been strong enough to bias her mental view without 
her knowledge, and she grew more and more satisfied with the 
course she had pursued after Greif had spoken. She saw clearly, 
now, that Greif was indispensable to her for Hilda's happiness, 
and she comprehended that he was worthy of the girl. 

In the wicked world which surrounded the Black Forest on all 
sides, persons would have been found malicious enough to suspect 
that Greif really wished to be free from his engagement with 
Hilda. He himself, had he been less excited, would have hesi- 
tated before speaking as he had done, lest such a motive should 
be attributed to him. He would have acted and talked with 
more diplomacy and less outward energy, though with the same 
inward conviction, and it is by no means impossible that Frau von 
Sigmundskron's first intention might in such a case have remained 
unchanged, and that she would have gently acquiesced in Greif's 
proposal to give up the marriage. But there was no guile in the 
baroness, and but little in Greif himself. He had been carried 
away in his speech by the sincerity of what he felt, the more 



 

easily because his whole nature was unstrung by grief ; and Hilda's 
mother had seen in him only the hero, ready to sacrifice everything 
for her he loved, and womanlike, she had felt irresistibly impelled 
to reward him on the spot by a generous sacrifice of those con- 
victions which his real or fancied eloquence had already destroyed. 
So simple was she, that it did not strike her that Greif s own 
position was changed, that he was all at once his own master, 
possessed of a large fortune and perhaps of tastes which he had 
concealed during his father's life. If the aforesaid wicked world 
had been acquainted with the circumstances, it would assuredly 
have taken this view into consideration. But that portion of man- 
kind in which are included so many of our acquaintance, but in 
whose numbers we ourselves are never found, were very far from 
Greifenstein, and the Lady of Sigmundskron knew little of their 
modes of thought. She saw that Greif was honest and she sought 
no malicious explanation of his intentions. On the contrary, the 
longer she reflected upon the interview, the more she admired him, 
and strange to say, the nearer she came to accepting his opinion 
of his father's guilt. 

She had meant to see Rex, and she had not been altogether 
decided to wait and allow the natural course of events to bring 
her the information she desired about his letter. She remembered 
with some surprise that her decision in the matter of the marriage 
was to have depended upon the knowledge of old Greifenstein's 
culpability or innocence which she had hoped to gain from Rex. 
It was evident that her mind was tired, and she resolved at last 
to rest. It was her duty, however, to see Rex before sleeping, if 
only to inquire about his state. She would certainly not ask 
him any questions. 

She found him reading still, or pretending to read, by the light 
of a shaded student's lamp. Upon another table there was a tray 
with a couple of covered dishes upon it. His older and tougher 
nature showed itself there, she thought, for he must have given 
the order himself. He rose politely as she entered, and offered 
her a chair. His manner contrasted so strongly with Greif's, as to 
make her wonder whether he were in reality much affected or not. 

' I will not stay,' she said. ' I only came to see how you were, 
and whether I could do anything for you.' 

' You are very kind. I have all I need, and more. Have you 
seen Greif?' 

' Yes. He has slept and I think he is safe. At first I feared 
lest^his mind should be affected. He is younger than you, Herr 
von Herr Rex and perhaps he is more sensitive.' 



 

' Perhaps,' replied Rex thoughtfully. ' Would he care to see 
me?' 

' I have no doubt that is he may possibly be tired ' she 

hesitated. 

Rex's stony eyes examined her face attentively. 

' You have had an interview with him,' he said in a tone of 
conviction, ' and you have talked about this dreadful matter. I 
have a communication to make to you, Frau von Sigmundskron. 
It will not take long.' 

The baroness started and looked at him earnestly. 

' What is it ? ' she asked. 

' You gave me a letter this morning. I will tell you frankly 
that you ought to have given it to the representatives of the law, 
for in such cases the law has a right to all letters of the deceased 
and can even cause them to be intercepted in the post-office.' 

' I did not know,' she replied, in some perturbation. 

' I did, but as no one asked me for the letter, I did not offer it. 
I cannot tell you all it contained, nor shall I tell Greif. But this 
I will tell you. My father arrived here last night, and almost 
immediately afterwards he and Herr von Greifenstein, jointly, 
killed Frau von Greifenstein, and then committed suicide.' 

' Is there no doubt ? ' asked the baroness nervously. She 
turned white at the thought of the scene his words recalled. 

'The last confessions of men about to die are generally trust- 
worthy,' remarked Rex rather drily. 

' Of course of course.' She wondered what other communica- 
tion the letter had contained. 

' Exactly, and you may rely upon the exactness of what I tell 
you. My poor father had no reason for deceiving me, nor was he 
a man to deceive any one. He had been a fanatic and an enthusiast 
in his youth, and if his fanaticism led him too far, he paid the 
penalty in forty years of exile.' 

' But what could have induced him or Greifenstein ' 

' Madam,' said Rex courteously, but firmly, ' I regret my in- 
ability to answer your question. It must be supposed that two 
such men had some cause for acting as they did, which seemed to 
them sufficient.' 

' Forgive me ! ' exclaimed the baroness. ' I did not mean to 
ask you. I thank you for having told me what you have. Am I 
to tell Greif ? I think indeed I know that what he believes 
coincides with your account.' 

' Then you had better say nothing. I could not show him the 
letter, and if he knew that there was one, he might naturally 



 

enough reproach me with a want of confidence in him. I should 
be sorry to be placed in such a position, at such a time.' 

For a few moments neither spoke. The baroness was formu- 
lating another question, which must be put to her companion. 

' Herr Rex,' she said at last, ' it is necessary that the last act 
of this tragedy should be completed to-morrow. You have a voice 
in the matter -' she hesitated. 

'Whatever you do will be well done,' answered Rex. He 
seemed to think the question over quickly. ' If you have any 
objections to his resting here,' he said presently, ' I will take him 
away. Do not let any feeling of delicacy prevent you from being 
frank.' 

' Let them lie together,' replied Frau von Sigmundskron. ' It 
would be Greif s wish. You are very thoughtful, Herr Rex, but 
you must not think that any such unkind feeling can exist any 
longer now. Though there is no real tie of blood, you are one of 
us. You and Greif should be as brothers.' 

A momentary light flashed in Rex's impenetrable eyes. 

' I will be a brother to him, if he will let me,' he answered 
steadily. c I thank you very much for w r hat you have done and 
for what you say.' 

Frau von Sigmundskron bade him good-night and went away. 
She was a woman, and her curiosity was strong, though her 
conscience was stronger. She felt that she was in the presence of 
some extraordinary mystery, and that Rex himself was a somewhat 
mysterious personage. His eyes haunted her and disturbed her 
peace, and yet she could not deny that she was attracted by him. 
His quiet dignity pleased her, as well as the tone of his voice. 
She liked his face and its expression, and her deep-rooted prejudices 
of caste were satisfied, for she recognised in him a man essentially 
of her own class. There was something very manly, too, about 
his bearing, which could not fail to impress a womanly woman, 
no matter of what age. But his eyes followed her and seemed to 
stare stonily at her out of the dark corners of the room. She was 
too much exhausted, however, to resist very long the oppression of 
sleep that came over her, and she was far too tired to dream, or at 
least to be conscious of dreaming. 

With the following morning came the last trial of her strength, 
and those who saw her wondered how a thin, pale woman, whose 
hair was already w r hite could show such constant energy, fore- 
thought and endurance. She had led a hard life, however, 
harder than any one there suspected, and she could have borne 
even more than was thrust upon her, without flinching or bending 



 

under the burden. On foot she walked in the mournful procession 
through the snow and the bitter wind, leaning but lightly on 
Greif's arm, and sometimes feeling that she was helping him 
rather than accepting his assistance. It was nearly a quarter of 
a mile from the castle to the spot where the burial-place of the 
Greifensteins was built in the depth of the forest, and the road 
was bad in many parts, though an attempt had been made to clear 
it, and the footsteps of those who bore the dead smoothed the 
path for the living who came after. 

At last it was over. The last short prayer was said. The 
great stone slab, green with the mould of centuries, was raised by 
twenty strong arms and was made to slide back into its place 
above the yawning steps that led down into the earth, the heavy 
doors of the mausoleum swung slowly upon their hinges, the 
huge, rusty lock was secured and the unwieldy key was solemnly 
placed in the hands of the new master of Greifenstein. With 
slow steps, two and two together, all went back through the dim 
shadows of the trees, while the icy wind whistled and roared upon 
them from every giant stem, and the trodden snow creaked 
beneath their feet. Two and two they re-entered the low 
gateway of the castle, till the iron -studded oak clanged behind 
the last pair, sending rolling echoes along the dark, vaulted 
way. 

An hour later Greif and Rex sat together in sad silence before 
the big blazing logs in Greif's room, faintly conscious of the 
comforting warmth, looking at each other from time to time 
without speaking, each absorbed by the pain of his own thoughts. 
It seemed as though several hours had passed in this way when 
Greif at last broke the silence. 

' I will ride to Sigmundskron to-morrow,' he said, ' and then 
we will go away.' 

Rex looked at him, nodded gravely and answered nothing. 

'We must go together, Rex,' said Greif after another long 
pause. * Will you come V 

I will go with you wherever you will. If we part it shall not 
be my fault.' 

' Thank you.' 

The great logs crackled and blazed, sending up leaping flames 
and showers of sparks into the wide chimney and reflecting a 
warm red glare which contrasted oddly with the cold and sunless 
light of the winter's afternoon. The sound and the sight of the 
fire supplied the place of conversation and animated the stillness. 

'Rex, did you know that I was to have been married next 



 

month ?' Greif asked the question suddenly, as though he had 
come to an unexpected decision. 

' I thought it possible that you would marry soon,' answered his 
companion. 

' I was to have been married to my cousin Hilda in January. 
How far away that seems ! ' 

' The daughter of Frau von Sigmundskron T 

' Yes. We have been engaged for years.' 

'And you are going to Sigmundskron to see her to tell 
her ' * 

' That it is all over.' Greif completed the sentence. 

Eex rested his elbows on his knees and leaned forward, staring 
at the fire. He knew what Greif meant without any further 
explanation, and he realised how much more his cousin would 
stand in need of comfort than before. But his active and far- 
sighted intelligence did not accept the necessity of breaking off the 
marriage. He approved of Greif 's wish to do so, and admired his 
courage, but at the same time he saw the utter desolation and 
gloominess of the life in store for him if he persisted in his inten- 
tion. He held his peace, however. 

'You see that I could not do otherwise,' Greif said at last. 
Still Eex answered nothing, and stared persistently into the 
flames, though his cousin was looking at him, 

' Would you,' continued Greif, ' if you were in my place, have 
the courage to offer such a name as mine to an innocent girl ?' 

'You are as innocent as she,' observed Rex. 

' ' Personally, but that is not the question. Would you bring 
her here to live in this house, to be a part of all the evil that has 
befallen me and mine ?' 

'You can live where you please,' said Rex philosophically. 
' And besides, by a very simple process of law you can call yourself 
by another name. Do away with the name and live in another 
place, and you are simply Greif and she is simply Hilda. There 
could be no question of doing her an injury. Names are foolish 
distinctions at best, and when there is anything wrong with them 
it is foolish not to get rid of them at once. Do you think that I 
would not marry as plain Herr Rex, though I am in reality the 
high and well-born Horst von Rieseneck *? I have but to make 
application for a legal change, pay the costs and the thing is 
done.' 

' Outwardly, it is true. But the fact would remain. You are 
Rieseneck and I am Greifenstein, for all our lives, and our children 
will be Riesenecks and Greifensteins after us, if we marry. I 



 

would not lay such a curse upon any woman, much less upon one 
I love.' 

' A curse is a purely conventional term, having no real meaning 
in life,' replied Rex. 'The reality is you yourself, your love and 
her love, whether you be the Emperor or Herr Schmidt. At 
least that is all the reality which can ever affect either of you, so 
far as marriage is concerned. I do not say that your name, or
