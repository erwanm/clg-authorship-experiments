think me worthy." 

" Ah, poor Julia ! " Biddy murmured, defensively. Her 
tone recalled to him that Julia had thought him worthy to 
unite himself to Bridget Dormer, and inevitably betrayed that 
the girl was thinking of that also. While they both thought 
of it they sat looking into each other's eyes. 

" Nick, I'm sure, doesn't treat you that way. I'm sure he 
confides in you ; he talks to you about his occupations, his 
ambitions," Peter continued. " And you understand him, you 
enter into them, you are nice to him, you help him." 
" Oh, Nick's life it's very dear to me," said Biddy. 



"That must be jolly for him." 

" It makes me very happy." 

Peter tittered a low, ambiguous groan ; then he exclaimed, 
with irritation : " What the deuce is the matter with them 
then ? Why can't they hit it off and be quiet and rational 
and do what every one wants them to do ? " 

" Oh, Peter, it's awfully complicated," said Biddy, with 
sagacity. 

" Do you mean that Nick's in love with her ? " 

"In love with Julia ?" 

" No, no, with Miriam Rooth." 

Biddy shook her head slowly ; then with a smile which 
struck him as one of the sweetest things he had ever seen (it 
conveyed, at the expense of her own prospects, such a shy, 
generous little mercy of reassurance) : " He isn't, Peter," she 
declared. "Julia thinks it's trifling all that sort of thing," 
she added. " She wants him to go in for different honours." 

"Julia's the oddest woman. I thought she loved him," 
Sherringham remarked. " And when you love a person 
He continued to reflect, leaving his sentence impatiently 
unfinished, while Biddy, with lowered eyes, sat waiting (it 
interested her) to learn what you did when you loved a person. 
" I can't conceive her giving him up. He has great ability, 
besides being such a good fellow." 

" It's for his happiness, Peter that's the way she reasons," 
Biddy explained. " She does it for an idea ; she has told me 
a great deal about it, and I see the way she feels." 

" You try to, Biddy, because you are such a dear good- 
natured girl, but I don't believe you do in the least. It's too 
little the way you yourself would feel. Julia's idea, as you 
call it, must be curious." 

"Well, it is, Peter," Biddy mournfully admitted. "She 
won't risk not coming out at the top." 

"At the top of what?" 

'Oh, of everything." Biddy's tone showed a trace of awe 
of such high views. 

"Surely one's at the top of everything when one's in love." 

"I don't know," said the girl. 

" Do you doubt it ? " Sherringham demanded. 

" I've never been in love and I never shall be." 

" You're as perverse in your way as Julia. But I confess 
I don't understand Nick's attitude any better. He seems to 
me, if I may say so, neither fish nor flesh." 

" Oh, his attitude is very noble, Peter ; his state of mind is 





wonderfully interesting," Biddy pleaded. " Surely you must 
be in favour of art," she said. 

Sherringham looked at her a moment. " Dear Biddy, your 
little digs are as soft as zephyrs." 

She coloured, but she protested. " My little digs ? What 
do you mean ? Are you not in favour of art ? " 

"The question is delightfully simple. I don't know what 
you're talking about. Everything has its place. A parlia- 
mentary life scarcely seems to me the situation for portrait- 
painting." 

'That's just what Nick says." 

' You talk of it together a great deal? " 
' Yes, Nick's very good to me." 

' Clever Nick ! And what do you advise him ? " 

' Oh, to do something." 

' That's valuable," Peter laughed. " Not to give up his 
sweetheart for the sake of a paint-pot, I hope  ? " 

" Never, never, Peter ! It's not a question of his giving 
up, for Julia has herself drawn back. I think she never really 
felt safe ; she loved him, but she was afraid of him. Now 
she's only afraid she has lost the confidence she tried to 
have. Nick has tried to hold her, but she has jerked herself 
away. Do you know what she said to me ? She said : ' My 
confidence has gone forever.' " 

" I didn't know she was such a prig ! " Sherringham ex- 
claimed. " They're queer people, verily, with water in their 
veins instead of blood. You and I wouldn't be like that, 
should we? though you have taken up such a discouraging 
position about caring for a fellow." 

" I care for art," poor Biddy returned. 

" You do, to some purpose," said Peter, glancing at the bust. 

" To that of making you laugh at me." 

" Would you give a good man up for that ? " 

" A good man ? What man ? " 

"Well, say me if I wanted to marry you." 

Biddy hesitated a little. " Of course I would, in a moment. 
At any rate, I'd give up the House of Commons. That's what 
Nick's going to do now only you mustn't tell any one." 

Sherringham stared. " He's going to chuck up his seat ? " 

" I think his mind is made up to it. He has talked me 
over we have had some deep discussions. Yes, I'm on the 
side of art ! " said Biddy, ardently. 

"Do you mean in order to paint to paint Miss RoothT' 
Peter went on. 





" To paint every one that's what he wants. By keeping 
his seat he hasn't kept Julia, and she was the thing he cared 
most for, in public life. When he has got out of the whole 
thing his attitude, as he says, will be at least clear. He's 
tremendously interesting about it, Peter ; he has talked to me 
wonderfully ; he has won me over. Mamma's heart-broken ; 
telling her will be the hardest part." 

" If she doesn't know, why is she heart-broken ? " 

" Oh, at the marriage not coming off she knows that. 
That's what she wanted. She thought it perfection. She 
blames Nick fearfully. She thinks he held the whole thing 
in his hand and that he has thrown away a magnificent 
opportunity." 

" And what does Nick say to her ? " 

" He says, ' Dear old mummy ! ' ' 

" That's good," said Sherringham. 

" I don't know what will become of her when this other 
blow arrives," Biddy pursued. " Poor Nick wants to please 
her he does, he does. But, as he says, you can't please 
every one, and you must, before you die, please youfself a 
little." 

Peter Sherringham sat looking at the floor ; the colour had 
risen to his face while he listened to the girl. Then he sprang 
up and took another turn about the room. His companion's 
artless but vivid recital had set his blood in motion. He had 
taken Nick Dormer's political prospects very much for granted, 
thought of them as definite and brilliant and seductive. To 
learn there was something for which he was ready to renounce 
such honours, and to recognize the nature of that bribe, 
affected Sherringham powerfully and strangely. He felt as 
if he had heard the sudden blare of a trumpet, and he felt at 
the same time as if he had received a sudden slap in the face. 
Nick's bribe was " art " the strange temptress with whom 
he himself had been wrestling and over whom he had finally 
ventured to believe that wisdom and training had won a 
victory. There was something in the conduct of his old friend 
and playfellow that made all his reasonings small. Nick's 
unexpected choice acted on him as a reproach and a challenge. 
He felt ashamed at having placed himself so unromantically 
on his guard, rapidly saying to himself that if Nick could 
afford to allow so much for "art" he might surely exhibit 
some of the same confidence. There had never been the least 
avowed competition between the cousins their lines lay too 
far apart for that ; but nevertheless they rode in sight of each 





other, and Sherringham had at present the sensation of suddenly 
seeing Nick Dormer give his horse the spur, bound forward 
and fly over a wall, He was put on his mettle and he had 
not to look long to spy an obstacle that he too might ride at. 
High rose his curiosity to see what warrant his kinsman 
might have for such risks how he was mounted for such 
exploits. He really knew little about Nick's talent so little 
as to feel no right to exclaim " What an ass ! " when Biddy 
gave him the news which only the existence of real talent 
could redeem from absurdity. All his eagerness to ascertain 
what Nick had been able to make of such a subject as 
Miriam Rooth came back to him ; though it was what mainly 
had brought him to Rosedale Road he had forgotten it in 
the happy accident of his encounter with Biddy. He was 
conscioxis that if the surprise of a revelation of power were 
in store for him Nick would be justified more than he him- 
self would feel reinstated in his self-respect. For the courage 
of renouncing the forum for the studio hovered before him as 
greater than the courage of marrying an actress whom one 
was iiVlove with : the reward in the latter case was so much 
more immediate. Peter asked Biddy what Nick had done 
with his portrait of Miriam. He hadn't seen it anywhere in 
rummaging about the room. 

" I think it's here somewhere, but I don't know," Biddy 
replied, getting up and looking vaguely round her. 

" Haven't you seen it ? Hasn't he shown it to you? " 

The girl rested her eyes on him strangely a moment ; then 
she turned them away from him with a mechanical air of seek- 
ing for the picture. " I think it's in the room, put away with 
its face to the wall." 

"One of those dozen canvases with their backs to us?" 

" One of those perhaps." 

" Haven't you tried to see ? " 

" I haven't touched them," said Biddy, colouring. 

" Hasn't Nick had it out to show you  ? " 

" He says it's in too bad a state it isn't finished it 
won't do." 

" And haven't you had the curiosity to turn it round for 
yourself  ? " 

The embarrassed look in poor Biddy's face deepened, and it 
seemed to Sherringham that her eyes pleaded with him a 
moment, that there was a menace of tears in them, a gleam of 
anguish. " I've had an idea he wouldn't like it." 

Her visitor's own desire however had become too lively for 





easy forbearance. He laid his hand on two or three canvases 
which proved, as he extricated them, to be either blank or 
covered with rudimentary forms. " Dear Biddy, are you as 
docile, as obliging as that  ? " he asked, pulling out something 
else. 

The inquiry was meant in familiar kindness, for Peter was 
struck, even to admiration, with the girl's having a sense of 
honour which all girls have not. She must in this particular 
case have longed for a sight of Nick's work the work which 
had brought about such a crisis in his life. But she had passed 
hours in his studio alone, without permitting herself a stolen 
peep ; she was capable of that if she believed it would please 
him. Sherringham liked a charming girl's being capable of 
that (he had known charming girls who would not have been), 
and his question was really an expression of respect. Biddy, 
however, apparently discovered some light mockery in it, and 
she broke out incongruously : 

" I haven't wanted so much to see it. I don't care for her 
so much as that." 

"So much as that? " 

" I don't care for his actress for that vulgar creature. I 
don't like her ! " said Biddy, unexpectedly. 

Peter stared. " I thought you hadn't seen her." 

" I saw her in Paris -twice. She was wonderfully clever, 
but she didn't charm me." 

Sherringham quickly considered, and then he said benevo- 
lently : " I won't inflict the picture upon you then ; we'll 
leave it alone for the present." Biddy made no reply to this 
at first, but after a moment she went straight over to the row 
of stacked canvases and exposed several of them to the light. 
" Why did you say you wished to go to the theatre to-night ? " 
her companion continued. 

Still the girl was silent ; then she exclaimed, with her back 
turned to him and a little tremor in her voice, while she drew 
forth one of her brother's studies after the other : " For the 
sake of your company, Peter ! Here it is, I think," she added, 
moving a large canvas with some effort. "No, no, I'll hold it 
for you. Is that the light ? " 

She wouldn't let him take it ; she bade him stand off and 
allow her to place it in the right position. In this position she 
carefully presented it, supporting it, at the proper angle, from 
behind and showing her head and shoulders above it. From the 
moment his eyes rested on the picture Sherringham accepted 
this service without protest. Unfinished, simplified and in 





some portions merely suggested, it was strong, brilliant and 
vivid and had already the look of life and the air of an original 
thing. Sherringham was startled, he was strangely affected 
he had no idea Nick moved with that stride. Miriam was 
represented in three-quarters, seated, almost down to her feet. 
She leaned forward, with one of her legs crossed over the other, 
her arms extended and foreshortened, her hands locked together 
round her knee. Her beautiful head was bent a little, brood- 
ingly, and her splendid face seemed to look down at life. She 
had a grand appearance of being raised aloft, with a wide 
regard, from a height of intelligence, for the great field of the 
artist, all the figures and passions he may represent. Peter 
wondered where his kinsman had learned to paint like that. 
He almost gasped at the composition of the thing, at the draw- 
ing of the moulded arms. Biddy Dormer abstained from look- 
ing round the corner of the canvas as she held it ; she only 
watched, in Peter's eyes, for his impression of it. This she 
easily caught, and he could see that she had done so when 
after a few minutes he went to relieve her. She let him lift 
the thing out of her grasp ; he moved it and rested it, so that 
they could still see it, against the high back of a chair. " It's 
tremendously good," he said. 

" Dear, dear Nick," Biddy murmured, looking at it now. 
" Poor, poor Julia ! " Sherringham was prompted to exclaim, 
in a different tone. His companion made no rejoinder to this, 
and they stood another minute or two side by side in silence, 
gazing at the portrait. Then Sherringham took up his hat 
he had no more time, he must go. " "Will you come to-night, 
all the same ? " he asked, with a laugh that was somewhat 
awkward, putting out his hand to Biddy. 
"All the same?" 

" Why, you say she's a terrible creature," Peter went on, 
with his eyes on the painted face. 

" Oh, anything for art ! " said Biddy, smiling. 
""Well, at seven o'clock then." And Sherringham went 
away immediately, leaving the girl alone with the Tragic Muse 
and feeling again, with a quickened rush, a sense of the beauty 
of Miriam, as well as a new comprehension of the talent of 
Nick. 



XXX. 

IT was not till noon, or rather later, the next day, that 
Sherringham saw Miriam Booth. He wrote her a note that 
evening, to be delivered to her at the theatre, and during the 
performance she sent round to him a card with " All right 
come to luncheon to-morrow," scrawled upon it in pencil. 

When he presented himself in Balaklava Place he learned 
that the two ladies had not come in they had gone again, 
early, to rehearsal ; but they had left word that he was to be 
pleased to wait they would come in from one moment to the 
other. It was further mentioned to him, as he was ushered 
into the drawing-room, that Mr. Dashwood was on the ground. 
This circumstance however Sherringham barely noted : he 
had been soaring so high for the past twelve hours that he had 
almost lost consciousness of the minor differences of earthly 
things. He had taken Biddy Dormer and her friend Miss 
Tressilian home from the play, and after leaving them he had 
walked about the streets, he had roamed back to his sister's 
house, in a state of exaltation intensified by the fact that all the 
evening he had contained himself, thinking it more decorous 
and considerate, less invidious not to "rave." Sitting there 
in the shade of the box with his companions, he had watched 
Miriam in attentive but inexpressive silence, glowing and 
vibrating inwardly, but, for these fine, deep reasons, not com- 
mitting himself to the spoken rapture. Delicacy, it appeared 
to him, should rule the hour ; and indeed he had never had a 
pleasure more delicate than this little period of still observation 
and repressed ecstasy. Miriam's art lost nothing by it, and 
Biddy's mild nearness only gained. This young lady was silent 
also wonderingly dauntedly, as if she too were conscious in 
relation to the actress of varicms other things beside her 
mastery of her art. To this mastery Biddy's attitude was a 
candid and liberal tribute : the poor girl sat quenched and 
pale, as if in the blinding light of a comparison by which it 
would be presumptuous even to be annihilated. Her subjection 
however was a gratified, a charmed subjection : there was a 
beneficence in such beauty the beauty of the figure that 
moved before the footlights and spoke in music even if it 
deprived one of hope. Peter didn't say to her, in vulgar 
elation and in reference to her whimsical profession of dislike 





at the studio : " Well, do you find this performer so disagree- 
able now  ?" and she was grateful to him for his forbearance, 
for the tacit kindness of which the idea seemed to be : " My 
poor child, I would prefer you if I could; but judge for your- 
self how can I ? Expect of me only the possible. Expect 
that certainly, but only that." In the same degree Peter 
liked Biddy's sweet, hushed air of judging for herself, of recog- 
nizing his discretion and letting him off, while she was lost in 
the illusion, in the convincing picture of the stage. Miss 
Tressilian did most of the criticism : she broke out cheerfully 
and sonorously from time to time, in reference to the actress : 
" Most striking, certainly," or, " She is clever, isn't she ? " It 
was a manner to which her companions found it impossible to 
respond. Miss Tressilian was disappointed in nothing but 
their enjoyment : they didn't seem to think the exhibition as 
amusing as she. 

Walking away through the ordered void of Lady Agnes's 
quarter, with the four acts of the play glowing again before 
him in the smokeless London night, Sherringham found the 
liveliest thing in his impression the certitude that if he had 
never seen Miriam before and she had had for him none of 
the advantages of association, he would still have recognized 
in her performance the most interesting thing that the theatre 
had ever offered him. He floated in. a sense of the felicity of 
it, in the general encouragement of a thing perfectly done, in 
the almost aggressive bravery of still larger claims for an art 
which could so triumphantly, so exquisitely render life. 
"Render it?" Peter said to himself. " Create it and reveal 
it, rather ; give us something new and large and of the first 
order!" He had seen Miriam now; he had never seen her 
before ; he had never seen her till he saw her in her conditions. 
Oh, her conditions there were many things to be said about 
them ; they were paltry enough as yet, inferior, inadequate, 
obstructive, as compared with the right, full, finished setting 
of such a talent ; but the essence of them was now irre- 
movably in Sherringham' s eye, the vision of how the uplifted 
stage and the listening house transformed her. That idea of 
her having no character of her own came back to him with a 
force that made him laugh in the empty street : this was a 
disadvantage she was so exempt from that he appeared to 
himself not to have known her till to-night. Her character 
was simply to hold you by the particular spell ; any other 
the good-nature of home, the relation to her mother, 
her friends, her lovers, her debts, the practice of virtues or 


   

industries or vices was not worth speaking of. These things 
were the fictions and shadows ; the representation was the 
deep substance. 

Sherriiigham had, as he went, an intense vision (he had 
often had it before) of the conditions which were still absent, 
the great and complete ones, those which would give the girl's 
talent a superior, glorious stage. More than ever he desired 
them, mentally invoked them, filled them out in imagination, 
cheated himself with the idea that they were possible. He 
saw them in a momentary illusion and confusion : a great 
academic, artistic theatre, subsidized and unburdened with 
money-getting, rich in its repertory, rich in the high quality 
and the wide array of its servants, and above all in the 
authority of an impossible administrator a manager person- 
ally disinterested, not an actor with an eye to the main 
chance, pouring forth a continuity of tradition, striving for 
perfection, laying a splendid literature under contribution. 
He saw the heroine of a hundred "situations," variously 
dramatic and vividly real; he saw comedy and drama and 
passion and character and English life ; he saw all humanity 
and history and poetry, and perpetually, in the midst of them, 
shining out in the high relief of some great moment, an image 
as fresh as an unveiled statue. He was not unconscious that 
he was taking all sorts of impossibilities and miracles for 
granted ; but it really seemed to him for the time that the 
woman he had been watching three hours, the incarnation of 
the serious drama, would be a new and vivifying force. The 
world was just then so bright to him that Basil Dash wood 
struck him at first as an harmonious minister of that force. 

It must be added that before Miriam arrived the breeze that 
filled Sherringharn's sail began to sink a little. He passed out 
of the eminently "let" draAving-room, where twenty large 
photographs of the young actress bloomed in the desert ; he 
went into the garden by a glass-door that stood open, and 
found Mr. Dashwood reclining on a bench and smoking 
cigarettes. This young man's conversation was a different 
music it took him down, as he felt ; showed him, very 
sensibly and intelligibly, it must be confessed, the actual 
theatre, the one they were all concerned with, the one they 
would have to make the miserable best of. It was fortunate 
for Sherringham that he kept his intoxication mainly to 
himself : the Englishman's habit of not being effusive still 
prevailed with him, even after his years of exposure to the 
foreign infection. Nothing could have been less exclamatory 





than the meeting of the two men, with its question or two, 
its remark or two about Sherringham's arrival in London ; 
its offhand " I noticed you last night I was glad you turned 
up at last," on one side, and its attenuated " Oh, yes, it was 
the first time I was very much interested," on the other. 
Basil Dashwood played a part in " Yolande," and Sherringham 
had had the satisfaction of taking the measure of his aptitude. 
He judged it to be of the small order, as indeed the part, 
which was neither that of the virtuous nor that of the 
villainous hero, restricted him to two or three inconspicuous 
effects and three or four changes of dress. He represented 
an ardent but respectful yoxing lover whom the distracted 
heroine found time to pity a little and even to rail at ; but it 
was impressed upon Sherringham that he scarcely represented 
young love. He looked very well, but Peter had heard him 
already in a hundred contemporary pieces ; he never got out 
of rehearsal. He uttered sentiments and breathed vows with 
a nice voice, with a shy, boyish tremor in it, but as if he 
were afraid of being chaffed for it afterwards ; giving the 
spectator in the stalls the feeling of holding the prompt-book 
and listening to a recitation. He made one think of country- 
houses and lawn-tennis and private theatricals ; than which 
there could not be, to Sherringham's sense, an association more 
disconnected with the actor's art. 

Dashwood knew all about the new thing, the piece in 
rehearsal ; he knew all about everything receipts and salaries 
and expenses and newspaper articles, and what old Baskerville 
said and what Mrs. Runier thought : matters of superficial 
concern to Sherringham, who wondered, before Miriam ap- 
peared, whether she talked with her "walking-gentleman" 
about them by the hour, deep in them and finding them not 
vulgar and boring, but the natural air of her life and the 
essence of her profession. Of course she did she naturally 
would ; it was all in the day's work and he might feel sure 
she wouldn't turn up her nose at the shop. He had to remind 
himself that he didn't care if she didn't that he would think 
worse of her if she should. She certainly had much con- 
fabulation with her competent playfellow, talking shop by the 
hour : Sherringham could see that from the familiar, customary 
way Dashwood sat there with his cigarette, as if he were in 
possession and on his own ground. He divined a great in- 
timacy between the two young artists, but asked himself at 
the same time what he, Peter Sherringham, had to say about 
it. He didn't pretend to control Miriam's intimacies, it was 





to be supposed ; and if he had encouraged her to adopt a 
profession which abounded in opportunities for comradeship 
it was not for him to cry out because she had taken to it 
kindly. He had already descried a fund of utility in Mrs. 
Lovick's light brother ; but it irritated him all the same, 
after a while, to hear Basil Dashwood represent himself as 
almost indispensable. He was practical there was no doubt 
of that ; and this idea added to Sherringham's paradoxical 
sense that as regards the matters actually in question he 
himself had not this virtue. Dashwood had got Mrs. Booth 
the house ; it happened by a lucky chance that Laura Lumley, 
to whom it belonged (Sherringham would know Laura Lumley?) 
wanted to get rid, for a mere song, of the remainder of a leass. 
She was going to Australia with a troupe of her own. They 
just stepped into it ; it was good air the best sort of air to 
live in, to sleep in, in London, for people in their line. 
Sherringham wondered what Miriam's personal relations with 
this deucedly knowing gentleman might be, and was again 
able to assure himself that they might be anything in the 
world she liked, for any stake he, Peter, had in them. 
Dashwood told him of all the smart people who had tried to 
take up the new star the way the London world had already 
held out its hand ; and perhaps it was Sherringham's irritation, 
the crushed sentiment I just mentioned, that gave a little 
heave in the exclamation : " Oh, that that's all rubbish ; the 
less of that the better ! " At this Basil Dashwood stared ; he 
evidently felt snubbed ; he had expected his interlocutor to be 
pleased with the names of the eager ladies who had " called " 
which proved to Sherringham that he took a low view of 
his art. The secretary of embassy explained, it is to be hoped 
not pedantically, that this art was serious work and that 
society was humbug and imbecility ; also that of old the great 
comedians wouldn't have known such people. Garrick had 
essentially his own circle. 

" No, I suppose they didn't call, in the old narrow-minded 
time," said Basil Dashwood. 

"Your profession didn't call. They had better company 
that of the romantic, gallant characters they represented. 
They lived with them, and it was better all round." And 
Peter asked himself for the young man looked as if that 
struck him as a dreary period if he only, for Miriam, in her 
new life, or among the futilities of those who tried to find 
her accessible, expressed the artistic idea. This at least, 
Sherringham reflected, was a situation that could be improved. 





He learned from Dashwood that the new play, the thing 
they were rehearsing, was an old play, a romantic drama of 
thirty years before, covered, from infinite queer handling, 
with a sort of dirty glaze. Dashwood had a part in it, but 
there was an act in which he didn't appear, and that was the 
act they were doing that morning. " Yolande " had done all 
" Yolande " could do : Sherringham. was mistaken if he 
supposed " Yolande " was such a tremendous hit. It had 
done vei'y well, it had run three months, but they were by no 
means coining money Avith it. It wouldn't take them to the 
end of the season ; they had seen for a month past that they 
would have to put on something else. Miss Booth moreover 
wanted a new part ; she was impatient to show what a range 
she was capable of. She had grand ideas ; she thought herself 
very good-natured to repeat the same thing for three months. 
Basil Dashwood lighted another cigarette and described to his 
companion some of Miss Booth's ideas. He gave Sherringham 
a great deal of information about her about her character, 
her temper, her peculiarities, her little ways, her manner of 
producing some of her effects. He spoke with familiarity and 
confidence, as if he knew more about her than any one else 
as if he had invented or discovered her, were in a sense her 
proprietor or guarantor. It was the talk of the shop, with a 
perceptible shrewdness in it and a touching young candour ; 
the expansiveness of the commercial spirit when it relaxes 
and generalizes, is conscious it is safe with another member 
of the guild. 

Sherringham could not help protesting against the lame old 
war-horse whom it was proposed to bring into action, who had 
been ridden to death and had saved a thousand desperate 
fields ; and he exclaimed on the strange passion of the good 
British public for sitting again and again through expected 
situations, watching for speeches they had heard and surprises 
that struck the hour. Dashwood defended the taste of London, 
praised it as loyal, constant, faithful ; to which Sherringham 
retorted with some vivacity that it was faithful to rubbish. 
He justified this sally by declaring that the play in rehearsal 
was rubbish, clumsy mediocrity which had outlived its con- 
venience, and that the fault was the want of life in the critical 
sense of the public, which was ignobly docile, opening its 
mouth for its dose, like the pupils of Dotheboys Hall; not 
insisting on something different, on a fresh preparation. 
Dashwood asked him if he then wished Miss Rooth to go on 
playing for ever a part she had repeated more than eighty 





nights on end : he thought the modern "run" was just what 
he had heard him denounce, in Paris, as the disease the 
theatre was dying of. This imputation Sherringham gain-

an unsmoked cigarette away. Of course she was a woman : 
there was no need of Dashwood's saying it a hundred times ! 

As for the repertory, the young man went on, the most 
beautiful girl in the world could give but what she had. He 
explained, after Sherringham sat down again, that the noise 
made by Miss Rooth was not exactly what this admirer 
appeared to suppose. Sherringham had seen the house the 
night before; would recognize that, though good, it was very 
far from great. She had done very well, very well indeed, 
but she had never gone above a point which ."Dashwood 
expressed in pounds sterling, to the edification of his com-
