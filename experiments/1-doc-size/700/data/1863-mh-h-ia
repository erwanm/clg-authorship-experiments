 

" Hero ! and hurry ! are you deaf ?" 

The groom shook his head as he disappeared in the stable, 
mplying that he could say much more on the subject if he 
?ared to risk further parley with his impatient superior. 

While he waited, Aleck walked the porch-floor fast and 
uriously ; gnawed his lip, as was his trick in moments of 
ntense excitement ; drew his breath in hot pants, like a wild 
inimal thirsting for prey. Hero was led around to the door, 
 splendid creature, full-blooded and thoroughly trained, 
stepping high and daintily. 

How poor Robert loved that horse ! The brother's look 
was not less fierce in the recollection, but the pat upon the 
arched neck, the word of salutation " Hero old fellow !" 
hat accompanied the hand caress, were signals of the inward 
bought. 

"He's dreadful skittish now-a-days, Mars Aleck!" cau- 
ioned the hostler, respectfully. " Not a man on this place 
lars to back him. Pears like he's been bewitched sence he 
was fetched home from Rock's tarvern ! He flung Art ur 
hree times on de way from dar as you heerd, may-be. 
Mimthin or somebody's sp ilt him for good an all I'm 
ifeard!" 

" He won't throw me ! Whoa !" 

A spring seated Aleck in the saddle, the horse bounded 
orward, and steed and rider swept down the lane with the 
ush of a whirlwind. 

" Thar's a par of em !" commented Ben, recovering his 
preath. "How Mars Aleck's eyes did snap! Wonder 
that's crossed him now ? I'd rather meet de debbil on de 
larkest night dat ever shone dan to stan in his way when 
lis blood is up !" 

It so happened that the illustrious Gabriel was at that 
very moment sauntering along the middle of the high road, 
in the direction of Befleview, snuffing in copious draughts 




of the pleasant air, and enjoying mightily the increasing 
warmth of the sun's rays upon his back. His mother, the 
baker of Belleview, had had "poor luck" with her last jug 
of yeast, and designing, on this day, to repair the misfortune, had, as he discontentedly phrased it, "rousted" her 
hopeful son from his bed at an unconscionably early hour, 
and despatched him to a neighboring plantation, to borrow 
from a sister in the profession a small quantity to "raise" 
the fresh supply. This was the meaning of the small tin- 
pail in southern parlance, " bucket" that dangled from 
Gabriel's hand, and was occasionally whirled dexterously 
about his head without a drop of its contents being spilled ; 
for the errand-boy was an adept in all arts of prestidigitation that came within the range of his observation and 
practice. 

As he walked he sang, kicking up the loose dirt in the 
road with his toes ; stopping, now and then, in his march, 
never in his song, to shy a stone at a bird, or a bushy ever 
green where bird or hare might be hiding. 

"In old Kentuck, in de middle of a brake, 
Dar lives a nigger, an dey call him Jake : 
Aroun de wood his axe am ringin , 
An dis de song dat he am singin : 

Oh, whar did you come from ? 

Knock a nigger down ! 

Oh, whar did you come from ? 

Knock a nigger down ! 

"Hi! what dat?" 

Ballad and feet were arrested that he might hearken. 
From afar off came to his ears the long, rapid gallop of a 
strained or fiery horse, beating loudly upon the softened 
ground ; ringing sharply against the stones. 

" Somebody in a hurry soon in de mornin !" and evidently considering this a ridiculous, instance of non-improvement 




of the rights purchased by early rising, he laughed, and 
went on in the roundelay : 

" Oh, come, my lub, an go wid me ! 
"We're gwine for to leave dig back country; 
Hoss an a cart for to tote you roun , 
"Walk up hill an 

"Lor! ef taint Mars Aleck!" 

There was a level and straight stretch of road before 
him, and just entering this vista he descried a horseman bear 
ing rapidly down towards him. Aleck Lay had never spoken 
unkindly to the boy; on the contrary, the graceless imp 
had received from both brothers pleasant jeste, friendly 
notice, and donations which were innumerable by his arithmetical powers. There was no conceivable reason why he 
should fear to encounter either of them, if his conscience 
were void of offence as was their conduct yet he stood 
stock still for an instant, eyes starting from their sockets, 
staring at the advancing terror ; then, seized, as braver 
men ay, and brave armies have been since by an unreasoning panic, he darted to the road-side fence, scrambled 
over it, and scampered across the field beyond, fast as his 
legs could carry and fear could drive him. 

" Hallo there ! Gabriel ! I want to speak to you !" 
called Aleck, who by this time was near enough to identify 
the flying figure. 

Gabriel ran on the faster, looking over his shoulder to see 
whether he were followed ; and, irritated at his contumacy, 
Aleck put Hero at the fence, cleared it, and galloped over 
the fallow ground upon the fugitive's track. A race so un 
equal could not last long. 

" Stop ! you scoundrel ! or I will ride you down !" came 
so distinctly to the boy's ear that he again glanced back, to 
calculate his chances for gaining the next and a higher- 
fence. 


Not a dozen yards in his rear was his pursuer ; his orbs 
of fire seemed to scorch his sight, even in that brief glimpse; 
before he could run ten steps further, the horse, whose 
streaming mane, glaring eyeballs, and open mouth, gave him 
the aspect of a demon, would be upon him. He yelled with 
affright, and dropped prone upon the earth. 

" You young villain !" Aleck leaned from his saddle, 
and grasping the boy by the collar, dragged him to his feet. 
" You audacious rascal ! what do you mean by running 
away from me when I order you to stop ?" 

" Lor a massy, Mars Aleck! is it you? I clar fore gracious I thought was an evil ! I most skeered out of my 
senses !" stuttered the victim, affecting the uttermost aston 
ishment. 

His captor was in no humor to be amused. 

" If I served you right, I would flog you soundly !" he 
pursued, giving him an admonitory shake, under which Gabriel staggered more than was at all necessary. " You 
knew me perfectly well before you started to run. If you 
want to save your bones, tell me the exact truth in answer 
to the questions I am about to ask you." 

" Yes, sar !" Gabriel surveyed the heavy hunting-whip 
in the rider's hand with an air of serious reflection. 

" You brought a letter to Mr. Robert Lay, on Christmas 
morning. Who sent it ?" 

" How was I to know, Mars Aleck ?" whimpered the 
hypocrite, the picture of aggrieved innocence. "I didn't see 
it wrote." 

" Who gave it to you ?" Aleck tightened his hold on the 
collar and raised his whip. " I'm not to be trifled with, boy !" 

Gabriel studied the lowering visage above him, 

" If you won't tell on me, sir ! Dey said dey would kill 
me if I let on a word, an what dey says, dey will do, Mars 
Aleck!" 




" So will I ! you may be sure of that ! What did you do 
with the letter Miss Helen sent by you, which you promised 
so faithfully to carry safely ?" 

" Wasn't dat de same I gave to Mars Robert ?" letting 
his under jaw drop, and looking as like a fool as he could. 

" I shall have to do it, I see !" 

Aleck jumped from his horse and clutched the liar's arm, 
his mien so full of wrathful determination that the last spark 
of Gabriel's audacity expired. 

" If you jes won t, sir, I will tell you ah  every single 
thing !" he begged, quaking with fear. " Marster, he nab 
bed me in de stable, while I was gettin de horse ready, 
an says he, c Gi me de letter ! and fore I knowed what I 
was, Mars Aleck, he had it in his hand, an says he to 
daddy, who had come in arter him Keep him here till I 
come back ! and he went to de house. Byme-by, here he 
come, wid anudder letter, or maybe de same I can't read, 
you member, Mars Aleck an tells me to ride like fury 
over to Greenfield an liver it, an ef I ever breathed a word 
of what he said or done he'd make mince-meat of me ; and 
daddy says, Ef you open yer ugly mouth bout dis I'll 
mash it in for you; an what was a poor felher to do, 
Mars Aleck ? Miss Helen, she can tell you how bad I felt 
when she talked to me so kind dat day, an I didn't dar , for 
my life, to let her know how I. had ceived her. I'm sure I 
allers set a deal of store by Miss Helen." 

" And that is ah  you have to say ?" interrupted Aleck. 
"To whom did you give the note Mr. Robert Lay sent 
back by your hand ?" 

" To daddy," the boy confessed, shame-facedly. " He was 
waitin for me at de fur gate, an I dar sn't say no to him when 
he speaks his mind. He gi me orders as how I was to tell 
Miss Helen dat Mars Robert hadn't wrote .nothin , but jes said 
All's right, an I stuck to de story, as Miss Helen knows." 




" That is all now, is it?" interposed Aleck, as before. 

" Every thing, sir ! I clar fore gracious I don't know 
nothin besides, and I never told a lie in my born days, only 
cept that once " 

His auditor had other work before him than staying to 
remind the pattern of juvenile veracity of the array of fibs 
he had endeavored to palm off upon him five minutes previous to this solemn asseveration. It was not certain that he 
heard any part of it beyond the first section, for, before it 
was finished, he was scouring the field, at full speed, to 
wards the highway. Gabriel stood motionless and agape 
until he saw Hero leap the fence and the centaur-like figure 
vanish, with meteor swiftness, at a curve in the road. 

Then he remarked, with philosophical coolness 

"Dat ar horse is done some fox-huntin in his day, I 
reckon !" and bethought himself of his pail of yeast. 

Not a drop remained in the fallen vessel ; worse than 
that ! Hero had put his iron foot upon it and crushed it 
to borrow Gabriel's simile " flat as a pan-cake," cover and 
all ! Here was a predicament ! Explanation of some kind 
was unavoidable, and a flogging equally inevitable. The 
only question that remained for his fertile genius to work 
upon during the melancholy stroll homewards, was whether the aforesaid flagellation would be lighter if he made a 
partial confession of the facts in the case, or if he plied his 
maternal parent with an entirely original version of the 
accident. 

To these perplexing lucubrations we are compelled to 
leave him, that we may follow the proceedings of a more 
interesting personage. 





CHAPTER XVI. 

ABOUT noon of the same day, a party of four horsemen 
halted in the public route to the Court House, at the 
entrance if entrance it could be called to a disused cart- 
road which led into the Belleview woods. There were still 
" draw bars," that is, rails, that could be slipped back 
through their openings in their supporting posts marking 
the spot where vehicles wood-carts and farm-wagons 
were once wont to pass in, but they were now moss-grown 
and decayed, and sumach and huckleberry bushes grew 
thickly on the other side. None of the band hesitated, 
however, to follow their leader when he tore the rotten 
rails from their rests, and, remounting, rode boldly past the 
sign-board a new and staring one, that forbade trespassing 
" under the severest penalty of the law." One pointed this 
out silently to another as they entered the gap, and the 
exchange of looks was pregnant with meaning. 

"That was put up the first week in January, said a 
third. " A queer time to warn off poachers. Especially 
when there is no game worth shooting in these woods at 
any season!" said his companion. 

The fourth man said nothing only pushed on deeper 
into the forest. He knew well the position of the " Spruce- 
pine" and the " old picnic ground." The tree, the solitary 
specimen of the kind in the vicinity, stood on the verge of 
a little glade, a natural break in the wood, turfy, and not 
too densely shaded, where, years ago, the young people for 



miles around had held a sylvan fete a bounteous dinner, 
and a dance on the grass that lasted until dark. Robert 
had danced with Lily Calvert more frequently than with 
any other girl there, and Helen was oftenest his brother's 
partner. How strangely the vision of the holiday scene 
arose before the latter now, bent, as he was, upon a mission 
so fearfully at variance with the events of that midsummer 
day ! 

He was diverted from his saddened musings by the ex 
traordinary conduct of his horse. He had ridden Hero 
that morning at Helen's desire. She fancied that she would 
be able to decide, upon seeing him now, whether he were 
the animal Booker rode upon that momentous Christmas 
day ; and although, after hearing Gabriel's story, Aleck had 
not deemed it necessary to afford her an opportunity to 
apply this test to her memory, he had not cared, or indeed 
thought, to exchange the steed for his own riding-horse. 
He had gone by the most direct road to the Court House, 
laid his story before a magistrate, obtained a search-warrant, 
and authority to arrest the suspected man ; collected a few 
friends in whose zeal and discretion he could confide the 
magistrate asking permission to be one of the number and 
having despatched a line to Maple Hill, to allay the solicitude 
his wife might feel at his prolonged absence, had set out 
for the spot designated in Lily's note. They had quitted 
the faint wheel-ruts that marked the windings of the old 
road several minutes before, and were making their way, 
still piloted by Aleck, in the direction of the spruce-tree, 
when Hero stopped short, threw up his head, and uttered 
a shrill neigh a sound so expressive of terror, so like a 
human utterance of fear or anguish, that it thrilled every 
heart. 

"Is this the place?" asked one of the party, in an awed 
whisper, riding up close to Aleck's side. 




" No I it is fully a hundred yards off! On, sir !" he urged 
the animal, and mad with impatience, forgetting that it was 
Robert's horse, and entitled to all gentleness of treatment at 
his hands, he struck him sharply with the whip. Hero rear 
ed once, then stood like a rock, his fore-feet planted deep in 
the damp, woody soil, ears pointed forward, eyes dilate, and 
nostrils quivering widely the picture of mortal fear. 

"There is something in this, Lay!" said the magistrate 
a grave, judicious man, whom no one had ever accused of 
excitability of imagination or a too ready credulity. " Gentlemen, if you please, we will examine this ground before 
going further !" 

Every man was upon his feet in a moment. The under 
growth was thick thereabouts, and they literally crawled 
upon their hands and knees in their anxiety to make the 
search thorough. Stones were upturned ; leaves swept away, 
that the bare earth might testify of any recent disturbance ; 
broken twigs and boughs inspected ; but the keenest eyes 
discerned nothing unusual, nothing that varied from the 
ordinary aspect of a winter forest. 

Leaving their horses, they went on foot to the natural 
clearing marked by the evergreen spruce, and there the examination was, if possible, more narrowly vigilant, and with 
a like result. There was absolutely naught to indicate that 
any deed of violence had ever marred the peaceful quiet of 
the pretty glade. The sun shone brightly upon the young 
turf, already sprouting under the genial skies ; and warm 
breezes of the past week ; there were birds twittering in 
the naked branches above their heads ; and as they drew to 
gether in the centre of the grass-plot, for conference upon 
the next best step to be taken, a hare, the most timid of 
forest-bred creatures, scudded by on her way to her not 
distant form. 

" We must make the arrest without additional evidence, 




gentlemen !" decided Mr. Reverdy, the magistrate. "Colonel Floyd's possession of the watch and bonds must be accounted for, and the matter of the supposed forgery cleared 
up, before we can lawfully or conscientiously abandon the 
task we have undertaken." 

" It will be a bad business for us all if he gets clear, after 
we; have brought so serious a charge," demurred one of the 
quartette a nervous, cautious man, and a near neighbor of 
the Floyds. "The colonel is a troublesome customer to 
manage, when his blood is up. I shouldn't relish being at 
enmity with him, if he is to go at large. He never forgives 
an affront." 

"Then, Mr. Dickson, you had better not accompany us !" 
rejoined Mr. Reverdy, in calm contempt. "For my own 
part, I shall probe this affair to the bottom, at any and every 
cost to myself. If no one else will go with us, Mr. Lay and 
myself will serve the warrant. Shall we return to our 
horses ?" 

Murmuring something to the effect that he had been 
"misunderstood," and that he was as " little afraid as any 
other man," Mr. Dickson walked back with the rest. 

" Lay ! this is certainly very singular !" said the foremost 
of them, going up to Hero and laying his hand upon his 
neck. 

The poor beast was covered with sweat, and shook in 
every joint. He responded to the friendly touch by another 
frightened neigh, wild and piercing as the former; and 
when Aleck took him by the head to lead him on again, 
struck his hoofs deep into the earth and pulled back with 
all his might. They all gathered about him, in wonder 
ment and inquiry. Aleck was the first to remark that the 
creature paid no attention to their movements ; that his eyes 
were fixed upon a cluster of saplings not four feet off. This 
they had examined more than once in their fruitless quest, 




but the change in his features now directed the attention of 
the others to the place. 

" There are no pine-trees near ! Those are hickory sap 
lings ! Why should the ground under them be covered 
with pine-needles !" 

The exclamation acted like an electric shock. All sprang 
forward to the work of clearing away the thick brown covering. It was several inches in depth, and looked as if 
swine had been bedded there during the cold weather an 
illusion that had completely imposed upon the search-party, 
until they observed that the leaves could not have fallen 
from the trees above ; and the improbability that they had 
been brought from a distance for such a purpose, when the 
herd could as well have been littered under the pines them 
selves, presented itself to every mind. A hoe, spade, and 
pickaxe were hastily produced from a bag which was lashed 
to the front of Hero's saddle, and while three used these to 
rake off the matted needles, the fourth scraped it aside with 
his bare hands. 

It was removed in less time than it has taken to describe 
the process, and there remained exposed a considerable area 
of lighter color than the black, rich soil around it, as if the 
earth had been carefully spread over a wide space, to avoid 
the appearance of elevation in any one spot. Near the 
middle of this was plainly visible a sunken spot, long and 
narrow, and perfectly regular in outline. Not a word was 
uttered, of command or remark, as each of the three men 
bent to his work, and dug as if his own life or death depended upon his diligence. 

Of the three ! The spade had fallen from the nerveless 
hand of the fourth, and his next neighbor, he who had 
labored with his fingers only, caught it ere it touched the 
ground, and struck it boldly into the soil. Sick with horror, 
Aleck leaned against a tree, and watched the rapidly 





deepening chasm at his feet ; noted the signs of a former 
excavation, in the leaves and sticks mingled with the earth 
they cast np. Would they have to dig far down ? and if 
so, would his strength and reason endure this racking suspense until they reached it ? 

The pit was already two feet deep, and the dirt lay compact as ever, settled by the snows and rains of two long 
winter months. Three feet ! they worked well ! Four ! 
they must be nearing it. 

Ha ! how carelessly that man plunged the pick-axe up to 
the helve ! Had he no thought of what he might strike 
into what substance the keen, cruel point might sink at any 
moment ! Again he swung the implement in the air and 
Aleck seized his arm convulsively when he would have 
brought it down. 

" For heaven's sake, Dickson ! be careful ! you cannot be 
far from it now!" he cried, harshly. 

None of the excited laborers had realized their exact 
position before ; but they eyed the dimensions of the pit 
now with careful, wondering attention, and the man who 
wielded the pick stepped one side and laid down the dangerous instrument. The others kept on with their task 
but delved warily, more slowly scraping instead of dig 
ging. The tedious process, necessary as he felt it to be 
their expression of watchfulness as each spadeful was're 
moved were more horrible than ah  that had gone be 
fore. 

" This is dying by inches !" he whispered to Dickson, who 
stood at his side ; and he put up his hand to wipe away the 
cold beads that, dripping from his forehead, were literally 
blinding him. 

"My God!" 

The low cry broke from one of the workmen, and at the 
same instant Dickson clutched Aleck's shoulder, dragged 




him some paces before he could recover from his surprise at 
the movement. 

" You must not see this, Lay ! indeed you must not !" remonstrated the neighbor, withstanding, with friendly 
violence, Aleck's struggles to escape from his hold. " Sit 
here !" He pushed him down upon the trunk of a fallen 
tree " Sit here, until I go and see whether it is best for 
you to be there !" 

Misled by the apparent obedience of his charge, he ran 
back to the grave. 

A grave, in truth, it was, and within it a figure, from 
whose features gentle hands were that moment withdrawing 
the only shield between it and the earth a coarse, gray 
blanket spread over the body, after the manner of a pall. 
Unchanged, save by the pallor of death, he slept there 
peacefully, as if loving, and not bloody hands had laid him 
down to his long rest ; as if a costly coffin had sheltered his 
mortal frame from the contaminating touch of his mother 
earth, and costly marble sought to immortalize his name and 
memory. 

A hollow groan caused the beholders to look up, and 
Aleck Lay's white face was seen leaning forward beside Mr. 
Dickson's, turned for one second to the blue, smiling heavens, 
and his arms were tossed aloft, none doubted, in agonized in 
vocation of Divine vengeance upon the murderer ; then, he 
spoke in accents more stern than sad 

" Lift him out ! Mr. Dickson, your house is nearest ; will 
you ride over and send some conveyance in which the body 
can be carried to Maple Hill ? Frank ! you will stay here 
until he returns, then gallop ahead, and prepare my wife for 
what she must see that is, if I am not at home myself by 
that time. I will exchange horses with you ; I think that mine 
will follow him. Mr. Reverdy, if you are ready, we will 
go direct to Belleview." 



They left the corpse upon a bed, hurriedly made of dry 
leaves a cloak wrapped about it and concealing it, save 
where one curl of fair hair, escaping from the folds, caught 
the reflection of the afternoon sun Frank Travis, a cousin 
of the Lays, and Robert's bosom friend, and the faithful 
Hero, its only guards. 

NOTE. It may interest the reader to know that nearly 
every incident relative to Robert Lay's murder had its 
counterpart in a case which came within range of the au 
thor's personal observation. The most important variations 
in the history, as here narrated, are the needful changes of 
dates, names, and locality. No portion of the story is more 
authentic than the phenomenon of Hero's behavior when 
in the vicinage of the hidden grave, and the discovery of 
the body as a direct sequence of the horse's remarkable 
conduct. 




CHAPTER XVII. 

COLONEL FLOYD S horse and buggy were at the door that 
morning at an unusually early hour. He had business to 
transact with a man who lived ten or twelve miles off, and 
he grumbled loudly at his wife's negligence, and cursed the 
cook's laziness in not having breakfast precisely at half-past 
seven, according to the mandate he had issued over night. 

" Lily, my love, you are eating nothing !" said Mrs. Floyd, 
solicitously, as she witnessed her niece's want of application 
to the tempting repast. 

" I am doing very well, thank you, mamma !" and the 
girl made a feint of using her knife arid fork. 

" Colonel ! I wish you would call at Dr. Bryan's as you 
are passing through the village, and ask him to drop in to 
see her," pursued the aunt. 

" What's the matter with you ?" snarled the master of 
the household, addressing Lily. 

" Nothing, sir. I feel quite well the warm weather 
makes me a little languid that is all !" she answered. 

But the slight agitation occasioned by his harsh, abrupt 
query, brought a tremor to her lips and tears into the large 
eyes, now sadly sunken and unnaturally bright. 

Her uncle scrutinized her sneeringly. 

" Which means that you are lovesick, and have the 
vapors ! Vastly pretty and interesting these look to younger men, but I don't believe that Dr. Bryan will admire 
them any more than I do. I sha n't be home to dinner, 




Mrs. Floyd," and having made these affectionate adieux, he 
stalked out. 

" Nine o'clock ! What is that confoundedly slow fellow 
lagging about now, I wonder ?" he uttered, stamping upon 
the front steps. " Dick !" he hailed a boy in the kitchen 
door. " Tell Booker I am waiting for him. Make haste, 
you rascal ! Do you hear ?" 

" Yes, sar !" 

The colonel waited, nevertheless, for a quarter of an hour 
more, when the dilatory factotum emerged from his dwelling, at one side of the yard, and came towards his irate 
master. 

" Come, Booker !" called the latter, in a milder tone than 
he would have employed towards any other person guilty 
of the heinous offence of delaying a departure he designed 
should have been immediate upon the termination of his 
morning meal. 

Booker drove him everywhere, now-a-days. Since his 
apoplectic attack in December, Colonel Floyd seemed 
distrustful of his continued physical vigor or mental sound 
ness. Booker had accompanied him during a week's ab 
sence in January a journey whose direction and intent were 
not revealed to his own wife which, Aleck had accident 
ally discovered, extended as far as Baltimore. The negro 
was not remiss in the improvement of the privileges accruing to him from his superior's partiality or conscious weak 
ness. He lorded it with a high, hard hand over his subjects 
nominal and real upon the estate, beginning, some were 
bold enough to. whisper, at the haughty proprietor of the 
manor. 

" It is half-past nine, Booker ! and we have a long jaunt 
before us." 

" Yes, sir ; but I should like to have a word with you 
first," replied the man, coolly, motioning his master further 



away from the porch to a position upon the lawn, where 
nothing they said could be overheard by the inmates of the 
house. 

Colonel Floyd followed, submissive as a child. 

" If you take my advice, sir, you will get ready for a 
very long jaunt," said the confidant, meaningly. " If I 
ain't mightily mistaken, there's mischief in the wind and 
a deal of it !" 

" Mischief! of what kind ?" 

" The worst that could come pon you, sir ; I'd better not 
mention it, even though there's nobody near enough to hear. 
Jeff Martin was here betimes this mornin , to say as how 
Mr. Aleck Lay stopped at his house yesterday, on his way 
back from Baltimore, and scared Jeff's wife he was from 
home himself into confessin that I had left a strange horse 
thar, Christmas day. The woman wouldn't allow to Jeff 
that she had told any thing, but one of the children was 
listenin , and let on to his father w T hat a fine gentleman she 
had had for a visitor. Jeff gave her a proper lesson how to 
hold her tongue hereafter, you may be sure, but that didn't 
undo what was done." 

"Well?" 

Colonel Floyd his complexion purple-gray was biting 
his nails, and grinding his heel into the turf, in a frenzy of 
anxiety. 

Booker's tone and look were dull to stolidity. 

" That's one item, sir. Another that I've just picked up 
is, that Mr. Aleck Lay overtook that bpy of mine, Gabriel, 
on the road, about an hour, or may-be an hour and a half 
ago, rid him down, and flogged him within an inch of his 
life, till the young fool was obliged to tell him that the letter 
he carried to Greenfield before breakfast, Christmas morning, wasn't the same Mr. Lay's wife that is now Miss Hel 
en that was had given him. The boy swears this was all 




that he got out of .h;m, and considerin that I've been thrash- 
in him for half an hour, off and on, to find out the truth, it 
may be as he says. Now, sir, I think you'll gree with me 
when I say that, in my pinion, Mr. Lay has struck a dangerous scent one that'll most likely bring him this way before 
night, and you'd better not be found too easy. Eight miles 
ride will take you to the ferry, and by going six miles on 
the other side of the river, you will strike the railroad. I've 
got no more advice to give, cept that you'd better have a 
few clothes and a plenty of money along. It's lucky you're 
not short of cash just now and oh ! before I forget it, col 
onel you'd as well leave me a hundred or so, for family ex 
penses, while you're gone."
