Clean and split a pair of young chickens down the back as for broiling.
Lay them in a dripping-pan; dash a cup of boiling water, in which have
been stirred two tablespoonfuls of butter, over them, and, covering
with another pan, cook until tender, and of an equal yellow-brownish
tint all over. Lift the pan, now and then, to baste freely—four times
with the gravy—twice, toward the last, with melted butter. Lay the
chickens in a hot-water dish; add pepper, salt, a chopped boiled egg,
finely minced, and a little minced parsley, with browned flour, to
the gravy. Boil up, and pour half over the chicken, the rest into a
gravy-boat.


MASHED SQUASH.

Peel, seed, and slice fresh summer squashes. Lay in cold water ten
minutes; put into boiling water, a little salt, and cook tender. Twenty
minutes will suffice if the squash be young. Mash in a colander,
pressing out all the water; heap in a deep dish, seasoning with pepper,
salt and butter. Serve hot.


STRING-BEANS.

See Thursday of Second Week in this month.


BEETS SAUTÉS.

Boil young sweet beets until nearly done—say forty-five minutes. Skin
and slice them. Have ready in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of melted
butter, one tablespoonful of vinegar, a small onion minced, salt and
pepper. When this begins to simmer, put in the beets, and cook ten
minutes, shaking the saucepan frequently, to prevent scorching. Put the
beets into a root-dish, and pour the dressing upon them.


CREAM PUDDING.

  1 quart of milk.
  1 cup of hot boiled rice well cooked, but not broken.
  1 cupful of sugar.
  1 heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch.
  5 eggs.
  ¼ teaspoonful of cinnamon and the same of grated lemon peel.

Heat the milk, stir in the corn-starch wet up with cold milk; then the
beaten yolks and sugar. Add to these the heaping cup of boiled rice.
Stir until it begins to thicken, add the seasoning, and pour into a
buttered bake-dish. Bake until well “set”; spread with a méringue of
the whites and a little sugar, made very stiff. When this has colored
lightly, take from the oven.

Make on Saturday, and set on ice until Sunday. The colder it is, the
better.



  Third Week.      Monday.
  ——
  Green Pea Soup.
  Beef Miroton.      Asparagus Omelette.
  Tomato Salad.      Green Peas.
  ——
  Mountain Custard, or “Junket.”

  ——


GREEN PEA SOUP.

Take the fat from the top of the corned-beef liquor; add the beef-bones
and any others you may have. Boil gently one hour, skimming often.
Strain, and put in two quarts of green peas, a minced onion, and a
bunch of sweet herbs. Cook forty-five minutes and rub to a pulp through
a colander. Add pepper, heat to a boil and pour upon dice of fried
bread laid in the tureen.


BEEF MIROTON.

Mince the remains of your corned beef; season with pepper, salt, a
little chopped pickle, two boiled eggs chopped fine; wet with whatever
gravy you may have, and put into a greased pudding-dish. Cover
with mashed potatoes, made very soft with milk and butter, sift
bread-crumbs over all, and bake, covered, half an hour, then brown.
This is a nice way of warming over cold meat.


ASPARAGUS OMELETTE.

  6 eggs beaten very light.
  1 bunch of asparagus, the green tops only. (The stalks will be
          an improvement to your soup.)
  2 tablespoonfuls of milk.

Beat whites and yolks together, add the milk, then the boiled
asparagus heads, cold and chopped fine. Have ready a frying-pan with
a tablespoonful of butter in it, hot, but not frying. Pour in the
mixture; shake well from the bottom as it forms, loosen from the pan
with “spatula” or cake-turner; fold over in the middle, and turn the
pan upside down upon a hot dish.


TOMATO SALAD.

Peel and slice your tomatoes, put into a salad-dish, and pour over them
a dressing prepared as follows:

  3 yolks of hard-boiled eggs, pounded.
  1 beaten raw egg.
  1 teaspoonful of salt.
  A pinch of cayenne.
  1 teaspoonful white sugar.
  2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil.
  1 teaspoonful of made mustard.
  ½ teacupful of vinegar.

Rub yolks, mustard, pepper, salt, sugar and oil to a paste. Beat in the
raw egg with your whisk, finally, the oil, a little at a time. Stir
a great lump of ice into the dressing, whirling rapidly for half a
minute. Take it out and pour the mixture over the salad.


GREEN PEAS.

For Green Peas Receipt, see Sunday of First Week in this month.


MOUNTAIN CUSTARD, OR “JUNKET.”

  2 quarts of milk.
  2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.
  Vanilla, or other essence.
  2 teaspoonfuls of liquid rennet—to be had at most of the grocers
          and all the druggists.

Pour the milk, slightly warmed, into a glass bowl; sweeten, flavor, and
stir in the rennet. Set in a rather warm place until it is firm, like
“loppered” milk or blanc-mange; then put on ice. If at the end of an
hour it remains liquid, put in more rennet. Do not let it stand until
the whey separates from the curd. Two hours in warm weather should be
enough. Eat with cream and sugar.

vermicelli; simmer fifteen minutes, and pour out. Put in the catsup
after the soup goes into the tureen.


BEEFSTEAK.

Flatten with the broad side of a hatchet, and broil quickly about ten
minutes over a clear, hot fire. Lay between two hot dishes, with salt,
pepper, and a great lump of butter upon it to draw the juices to the
surface, for five minutes before serving.


YOUNG ONIONS.

Cut off stems and tops, skin and cook them in plenty of boiling water
for fifteen minutes. Have ready another saucepan with a large spoonful
of butter melted in it, but not hissing hot. Put in the onions, with
a little chopped parsley, and let them warm slowly ten minutes. Then
add a cup of milk in which have been stirred salt, pepper, and half
a teaspoonful of corn-starch. Simmer all for three minutes, stirring
several times, and pour out.


SPINACH.

Boil in hot, salted water twenty minutes. Drain well, and chop fine.
Put into a saucepan with a good spoonful of butter, a little sugar,
salt and pepper, a dust of nutmeg, and a few teaspoonfuls of milk, and

  1 turnip.
  1 cup small string-beans.
  6 tomatoes.
  1 onion.
  ¼ of a cabbage-heart.

Cook ten minutes in salted boiling water, leaving out the tomatoes.
Drain away the water, and spread the vegetables upon a dish to cool,
while you take the fat from your cold soup-stock; strain the latter
from the bones and meat, and heat to a gentle boil. Continue this for
five minutes, skimming well; put in the parboiled vegetables, the
tomatoes, and a pint of green peas, and stew steadily, but not fast,
for half an hour. Pour out all together.


LAMB CUTLETS.

Trim carefully, lay in a little warmed butter for an hour, turning
several times. Then broil upon a greased gridiron, taking care they do
not drip. Butter, pepper, and salt each, and lay them in a circle about
the peas purée.


PURÉE OF GREEN PEAS.

Boil three pints of green peas until soft. Rub them, while hot, through
a fine colander. Work in a tablespoonful of butter, cut up in flour;
pepper and salt to taste; add three teaspoonfuls of milk, and stir in
a saucepan until very hot and smooth. Put in the centre of a hot, flat
dish, with the cutlets about it, and help out both at the same time.


POTATO STRIPS.

Pare large potatoes: cut into long strips; lay in ice-cold water one
hour; dry between two towels and fry in salted dripping to a light
brown. Drain well, and dish upon a folded napkin.


LETTUCE.

Pull out and tear apart the white hearts, and heap within a salad-bowl.
Rub together

  2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil.

  1 onion stuck with three cloves.
  Teaspoonful of celery essence.
  Bunch of sweet herbs.
  1 blade of mace.
  Juice of half a lemon.
  Pepper and salt.
  5 quarts of cold water.
  ½ cup of German sago.

Boil the feet, onion, herbs, and the veal, cut into strips, in the
water for four hours, diminishing the liquid to three quarts. Strain,
and cool. Put two of the feet and the veal back into one quart of the
broth; season, and set by on the ice. Take the fat from the rest;
put the liquor, seasoned, over the fire, boil gently and skim, add
the sago, previously soaked two hours in a cup of cold water, simmer
tender, and pour out. You can, if you like, add a glass of pale sherry.


STEWED SHEEP’S TONGUES.

Speak for six sheep’s tongues several days before you want them, unless
you have access to a large market. Wash well in several waters. Boil in
hot, salted water half an hour, to loosen the skins. Take these off and
trim neatly. Put a cupful of your soup—before adding the tapioca—into
a saucepan, with a quarter-pound of sliced salt pork, a teaspoonful of
chopped onion, pepper, and a lump of white sugar. Lay in the tongues,
sliced lengthwise, and stew half an hour. Lay the slices in rows,
overlapping one another, upon a hot dish; thicken the gravy with
browned flour, add the juice of a lemon, boil once, and pour upon the
tongues.


POTATOES À LA LOUISE.

Mash the potatoes, and whip with a fork to a light cream, adding milk
and butter, salt and pepper. Heap upon a shallow pie-plate, well
greased, and set in the oven until a white crust has gathered over it.
Then, wash the mound well with beaten egg. Set in a moderate oven long
enough to harden this, but not until the yellow changes to brown. Slip,
without breaking, to another dish, by the help of the spatula.


SPINACH.

HALIBUT CHOWDER.

  3 lbs. of halibut, freed from bones, and cut into strips two inches
          long.
  6 parboiled potatoes, sliced.
  2 cups of milk.
  1 good-sized onion, sliced.
  Chopped parsley.
  3 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour, with butter for 6 Boston
          crackers, split.
  Enough boiling water to cover fish and potatoes.
  Pepper and salt.

Put a layer of fish in the bottom of a pot; season, and sprinkle
with parsley. Hide this with sliced potato. More fish, and yet more
potatoes, until all are in, when cover with boiling water. Put on the
lid, and simmer half an hour after the boil recommences. Have ready
the hot milk in another saucepan; stir in the floured butter. Dip the
crackers in boiling water, butter and salt them, and line the bottom
of your tureen with them. Pour in the boiling milk; then the fish and
potatoes. Send around sliced lemon with it.


CHICKEN POT-PIE, WITH DUMPLINGS.

Clean and cut up the chicken as for fricassee. Put a good layer of salt
pork in the bottom of a broad, not too deep pot; then a small onion,
sliced, the chicken, peppered, and enough cold water to cover it well.
Over this lay a thick sheet of good “family” pie-crust. Stew one hour
and a half; then brown the crust by putting a red-hot stove-cover on
the top of the pot. Take off the crust with care, and set by. Take out
the chicken and arrange upon a hot-water dish. If the gravy has boiled
down too low, add a little hot water. Drop in while the liquor is
boiling hot, squares or rounds of raw pie-paste; cook ten minutes, and
lay upon the chicken. Stir into the gravy a large spoonful of butter
rolled in flour; boil up, and pour upon the dumplings and chicken. Lay
the crust on top.


SEA-KALE.

Boil fifteen minutes in hot, salted water. Drain well, and return
to the fire, with a spoonful of butter, pepper, salt, and a little
lemon-juice. Stir, or toss, five minutes, and heap upon rounds of
buttered toast in a hot dish.


BAKED TOMATOES.

Peel and slice large, ripe tomatoes. Chop fine a little streaked salt
pork, or ham. Butter a pudding-dish, and cover the bottom with slices
of tomato. Season with pepper and sugar, and strew with bread-crumbs.
Then scatter chopped pork over it. Fill the dish in this order, having
crumbs at the top. Cover closely, and bake half an hour, or until the
juice bubbles up at the sides. Brown nicely, and serve in the dish.


CHARLOTTE RUSSE.

  A large sponge-cake.
  1 pint of cream.
  ½ lb. of sugar, powdered.
  Whites of 2 eggs.

Line a tin mould with straight sides with slices of cake, having the
bottom in one piece, if possible. Whip the cream in a syllabub-churn,
and, with your egg-beater, whisk into this, gradually, the frothed
whites and the sugar, flavoring to taste. Fill the cake-lined mould
with this, cover with more slices, and set in ice for an hour or so.
Pass a knife around the inside of the mould to loosen the cake, and
invert upon a plate. Sift powdered sugar over it.

  ——
  Cream Soup.
  Boiled Mutton.      Hot Slaw.
  Buttered Potatoes.      Mashed Squash.
  ——
  Cherry Roley-Poley.
  ——


CREAM SOUP.

If your jelly-soup stock has been kept upon the ice these two days, it
is as good now as on Thursday. Take off the fat, add a pint of boiling
water to the soup, and stew slowly for half an hour. Strain, add more
seasoning, and skim for a few minutes until quite clear in boiling.
Heat in another vessel a pint of milk; stir in a tablespoonful of
butter and the same of corn-starch wet up in cold milk, with a little
nutmeg. Pour this upon two beaten eggs, cook one minute, and put into
the tureen. Add the boiling soup, and stir all up well. It will be wise
to put a pinch of soda in the milk before boiling.


BOILED MUTTON.

Put on in plenty of boiling water, salted, and cook twelve minutes to
the pound. Take out, wipe carefully with a hot, wet cloth; butter all
over, and serve with a cup of drawn butter sent up in a sauce-boat.
Season the pot-liquor, and, when cool, put upon the ice.


HOT SLAW.

Shred a small white cabbage. Boil for fifteen minutes in hot water,
salted. Throw this away, and add four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, the
same quantity of your soup-stock, with pepper and salt. Simmer in this
ten minutes, stirring often. Turn out into a deep dish; pour over it
half a cupful of drawn butter; set in a pan of boiling water five or
six minutes, and serve.


BUTTERED POTATOES.

Slice cold boiled potatoes lengthwise. Put into a saucepan a good lump
of butler, with pepper and salt. Add the potatoes as the butter melts,
and shake over the fire until they are very hot and covered with a sort
of glaze, but not browned.


MASHED SQUASH.

Receipt given last Sunday.


CHERRY ROLEY-POLEY.

  1 quart of flour—Hecker’s prepared.
  1 heaping tablespoonful of lard, and the same of butter.
  1 teaspoonful of salt.
  2 cups of milk.
  2 cups of stoned cherries.
  1 cup of sugar.

Make a soft paste of flour, with the shortening chopped into it, and
the milk. Roll out, a quarter of an inch thick, into an oblong sheet.
Cover this with cherries; sprinkle with sugar, and roll up closely upon
the fruit. In spreading the cherries, leave a narrow margin on both
sides of the sheet. Baste the roll up in a bag floured well on the
inside, and make a “felled” seam at the open end to keep out the water.
Fit it exactly, but not tightly, to the shape of the pudding. Plunge
into a pot of boiling water and keep it at a steady boil for one hour
and a half. Dip the bag into cold water, rip the stitches, and turn out
upon a hot dish. Eat with hard sauce.

  ——


MUTTON, RICE, AND TOMATO BROTH.

Take the fat from the surface of the liquor in which your mutton was
boiled yesterday. Add to this broth the bones of the cold mutton well
cracked, and let them boil slowly one hour and a half. Strain and cool
to throw up the fat; remove this, and put the soup over the fire with
one quart of ripe tomatoes, peeled and cut very fine, and half a cup
of raw rice. Stew forty minutes. Add a lump of sugar; more pepper and
salt, if needed, and a tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet in cold water.
Boil one minute, and pour out.


GLAZED HAM.

Boil a ham on Saturday, allowing twenty minutes to the pound, and let
it get cold in the liquor. Set by then, and, early Sunday morning,
skin it carefully, and trim away the rusty edges. Brush all over with
beaten egg, and cover with a paste of rolled cracker wet up with
milk, seasoned with pepper, and bound with beaten egg. It should be a
quarter of an inch thick. Set the ham in the oven until this is lightly
browned. Serve cold and slice thin. Garnish with frilled paper about
the shank.


GREEN PEAS.

Shell and lay in cold water fifteen minutes. Cook from twenty to
twenty-five minutes in boiling salted water. Drain, put into a deep
dish with a good lump of butter; pepper and salt to taste.


POTATOES AU GRATIN.

Mash with milk and butter, and press firmly into a pretty mould wet
with cold water. Turn out at once; sift fine dry crumbs all over
the mould of potato; set in the oven five minutes to get it quite hot
again, and serve.


STEWED LIMA BEANS.

Shell; lay in cold water ten minutes. Boil tender in hot, salted water.
Drain this off, and add a scant cup of hot milk; a good spoonful of
butter, rolled in a very little flour, with pepper and salt. Simmer
three minutes and pour into a deep dish.


TOMATO SALAD.

Peel with a keen knife, and slice red, ripe tomatoes. Make a dressing
like that for lettuce on Wednesday.


SPANISH CREAM.

  ½ box of Coxe’s Gelatine.
  1 quart of milk.
  Beaten yolks of 3 eggs.
  1 small cup of sugar.
  2 teaspoonfuls flavoring extract—orange is very good in this cream.
  A little soda.

Soak the gelatine in the milk two hours. Stir in the soda, and heat,
stirring often. When scalding hot, pour upon the beaten yolks and
sugar, and return to the farina-kettle. Boil one minute, stirring
ceaselessly. Strain through tarlatan, and when cold, flavor and put
into a wet mould. Set on the ice until wanted, and eat with cream and
sugar. Make this, of course, on Saturday.


COFFEE AND MACAROONS.

Bring these on last of all.

  Meat of one boiled lobster, or a can of preserved lobster.
  1 quart of milk.
  1 quart of boiling water.
  ½ cup rolled cracker.
  4 tablespoonfuls of butter.
  Pepper (cayenne) and salt.

Pound the coral and other soft parts of the lobster to a paste, and
simmer five minutes in the boiling water; then rub through a colander
back into the water. Cut the rest of the lobster-meat into dice, and
put into a saucepan with the cracker-crumbs. Pour the red water over
them, and heat to a boil, when add pepper, salt, and the butter.
Simmer, covered, half an hour, taking care it does not scorch. Heat the
milk, with a pinch of soda, in another vessel, and after the lobster is
in the tureen, pour this in, boiling hot. Pass sliced lemon with it.


A GOOD “PICK-UP” DISH.

  2 lbs. of calf s liver, boiled and cold.
  1 lb. cold cooked ham.
  A cup of gravy, saved from yesterday’s soup, and strained.
  ½ cup bread-crumbs.
  3 eggs, beaten light.
  Parsley.
  A very little minced onion, with pepper and a little salt.

Chop liver and ham; wet with the gravy; mix in seasoning and crumbs,
and beat the eggs in. Put the mixture into a well-greased mould; cover
this and put into a dripping-pan full of boiling water. Cook thus one
hour and a half, keeping plenty of water in the pan, and at a steady
boil. Turn out upon a dish; pour a cup of drawn butter over it, and
serve.


BAKED POTATO BALLS.

Rub cold mashed potato, left from yesterday, smooth with a spoonful of
warmed butter, and soft with warmed milk. Beat up an egg in it, and
stir, until hot, in a clean, greased frying-pan, not allowing it to
“catch” on the side. Then let it cool. When cold and stiff, make into
balls, roll these in flour, and bake upon a greased pan until well
browned. Pile upon a hot dish.
