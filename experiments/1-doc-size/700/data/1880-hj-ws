" If your leg is a metaphor for young Townsend, 
I can assure you he has never been crushed. Crushed? Not he! He is alive and perfectly intact; 
and that's why I am not satisfied." 

" Should you have liked to kill him ?" asked Mrs. 
Almond. 

" Yes, very much. I think it is quite possible that 
it is all a blind." 







"A blind?" 

" An arrangement between them. II fait le mort, 
as they say in France ; but he is looking out of the 
corner of his eye. You can depend upon it, he has 
not burnt his ships ; he has kept one to come back 
in. When I am dead, he will set sail again, and then 
she will marry him." 

"It is interesting to know that you accuse your 
only daughter of being the vilest of hypocrites," 
said Mrs. Almond. 

"I don't see what difference her being my only 
daughter makes. It is better to accuse one than a 
dozen. But I don't accuse any one. There is not 
the smallest hypocrisy about Catherine, and I deny 
that she even pretends to be miserable." 

The Doctor's idea that the thing was a " blind " 
had its intermissions and revivals; but it may be 
said, on the whole, to have increased as he grew old- 
er ; together with his impressions of Catherine's 
blooming and comfortable condition. Naturally, if 
he had not found grounds for viewing her as a love- 
lorn maiden during the year or two that followed 
her great trouble, he found none at a time when she 
had completely recovered her self-possession. He 
was obliged to recognize the fact that, if the two 
young people were waiting for him to get out of 
the way, they were at least waiting very patiently. 
He had heard from time to time that Morris was in 
New York ; but he never remained there long, and, 
to the best of the Doctor's belief, had no communication with Catherine. He was sure they never met, and he had reason to suspect that Morris never 
wrote to her. After the letter that has been mentioned, she heard from him twice again, at consider- 
able intervals ; but on none of these occasions did 
she write herself. On the other hand, as the Doc- 
tor observed, she averted herself rigidly from the 
idea of marrying other people. Her opportunities 
for doing so were not numerous, but they occurred 
often enough to test her disposition. She refused a 
widower, a man with a genial temperament, a hand- 
some fortune, and three little girls (he had heard 
that she was very fond of children, and he pointed 
to his own with some confidence) ; and she turned a 
deaf ear to the solicitations of a clever young law- 
yer, who, with the prospect of a great practice, and 
the reputation of a most agreeable man, had had the 
shrewdness, when he came to look about him for a 
wife, to believe that she would suit him better than 
several younger and prettier girls. Mr. Macalister, 
the widower, had desired to make a marriage of rea- 
son, and had chosen Catherine for what he supposed 
to be her latent matronly qualities ; but John Lud- 
low, who was a year the girl's junior, and spoken of 
always as a young man who might have his " pick," 
was seriously in love with her. Catherine, how- 
ever, would never look at him ; she made it plain 
to him that she thought he came to see her too of- 
ten. He afterward consoled himself, and married a 
very different person, little Miss Sturtevant, whose 
attractions were obvious to the dullest comprehen- 
sion. Catherine, at the time of these events, had 
left her thirtieth year well behind her, and had quite 
taken her place as an old maid. Her father would 
have preferred she should marry, and he once told 
her that he hoped she would not be too fastidious. 





" I should like to see you an honest man's wife be- 
fore I die," he said. This was after John Ludlow 
had been compelled to give it up, though the Doc- 
tor had advised him to persevere. The Doctor ex- 
ercised no further pressure, and had the credit of 
not " worrying " at all over his daughter's single- 
ness; in fact, he worried rather more than appeared, 
and there were considerable periods during which 
he felt sure that Morris Townsend was hidden be- 
hind some door. " If he is not, why doesn't she 
marry?" he asked himself. "Limited as her intel- 
ligence may be, she must understand perfectly well 
that she is made to do the usual thing." Catherine, 
however, became an admirable old maid. She form- 
ed habits, regulated her days upon a system of her 
own, interested herself in charitable institutions, 
asylums, hospitals, and aid societies ; and went gen- 
erally, with an even and noiseless step, about the 
rigid business of her life. This life had, however, a 
secret history as well as a public one if I may talk 
of the public history of a mature and diffident spin- 
ster for whom publicity had always a combination 
of terrors. From her own point of view the great 
facts of her career were that Morris Townsend had 
trifled with her affection, and that her father had 
broken its spring. Nothing could ever alter these 
facts ; they were always there, like her name, her 
age, her plain face. Nothing could ever undo the 
wrong or cure the pain that Morris had inflicted on 
her, and nothing could ever make her feel toward 
her father as she felt in her younger years. There 
was something dead in her life, and her duty was 
to try and fill the void. Catherine recognized this 





duty to the utmost ; she had a great disapproval of 
brooding and moping. She had, of course, no fac- 
ulty for quenching memory in dissipation ; but she 
mingled freely in the usual gayeties of the town, 
and she became at last an inevitable figure at all 
respectable entertainments. She was greatly liked, 
and as time went on she grew to be a sort of kind- 
ly maiden -aunt to the younger portion of society. 
Young girls were apt to confide to her their love 
affairs (which they never did to Mrs. Penniman), 
and young men to be fond of her without knowing 
why. She developed a few harmless eccentricities ; 
her habits, once formed, were rather stiffly maintain- 
ed ; her opinions, on all moral and social matters, 
were extremely conservative; and before she was 
forty she was regarded as an old-fashioned person, 
and an authority on customs that had passed away. 
Mrs. Penniman, in comparison, was quite a girlish 
figure; she grew younger as she advanced in life. 
She lost none of her relish for beauty and mystery, 
but she had little opportunity to exercise it. With 
Catherine's later wooers she failed to establish rela- 
tions as intimate as those which had given her so 
many interesting hours in the society of Morris 
Townsend. These gentlemen had an indefinable 
mistrust of her good offices, and they never talked 
to her about Catherine's charms. Her ringlets, her 
buckles and bangles glistened more brightly with 
each succeeding year, and she remained quite the 
same officious and imaginative Mrs. Penniman, and 
the odd mixture of impetuosity and circumspection, 
that we have hitherto known. As regards one point, 
however, her circumspection prevailed, and she must 





be given due credit for it. For upward of seven- 
teen years she never mentioned Morris Townsend's 
name to her niece. Catherine was grateful to her, 
but this consistent silence, so little in accord with 
her aunt's character, gave her a certain alarm, and 
she could never wholly rid herself of a suspicion 
that Mrs. Peunirnan sometimes had news of him. 



XXXIII. 

LITTLE by little Doctor Sloper had retired from 
his profession ; he visited only those patients in 
whose symptoms he recognized a certain originality. 
He went again to Europe, and remained two years ; 
Catherine went with him, and on this occasion Mrs. 
Penniman was of the party. Europe apparently 
had few surprises for Mrs. Penniman, who frequent- 
ly remarked, in the most romantic sites, " You know 
I am very familiar with all this." It should be add- 
ed that such remarks were usually not addressed to 
her brother, or yet to her niece, but to fellow-tourists 
who happened to be at hand, or even to the cicerone 
or the goatherd in the foreground. 

One day, after his return from Europe, the Doc- 
tor said something to his daughter that made her 
start it seemed to come from so far out of the 
past. 

"I should like you to promise me something be- 
fore I die." 

" Why do you talk about your dying ?" she asked. 

" Because I am sixty-eight years old." 





" I hope you will live a long time," said Cathe- 
rine. 

" I hope I shall ! But some day I shall take a 
bad cold, and then it will not matter much what any 
one hopes. That will be the manner of my exit, 
and when it takes place, remember I told you so. 
Promise me not to marry Morris Townsend after 
I am gone." 

This was what made Catherine start, as I have 
said ; but her start was a silent one, and for some 
moments she said nothing. " Why do you speak of 
him ?" she asked at last. 

"You challenge everything I say. I speak of 
him because he's a topic, like any other. He's to be 
seen, like any one else, and he is still looking for a 
wife having had one and got rid of her, I don't 
know by what means. He has lately been in New 
York, and at your cousin Marian's house ; your aunt 
Elizabeth saw him there." 

u They neither of them told me," said Catherine. 

" That's their merit ; it's not yours. He has grown 
fat and bald, and he has not made his fortune. But 
I can't trust those facts alone to steel your heart 
against him, and that's why I ask you to promise." 

" Fat and bald ;" these words presented a strange 
image to Catherine's mind, out of which the mem- 
ory of the most beautiful young man in the world 
had never faded. " I don't think you understand," 
she said. " I very seldom think of Mr. Townsend." 

" It will be very easy for you to go on, then. 
Promise me, after my death, to do the same." 

Again, for some moments, Catherine was silent ; 
her father's request deeply amazed her ; it opened 





an old wound, and made it ache afresh. " I don't 
think I can promise that," she answered. 

" It would be a great satisfaction," said her father. 

" You don't understand. I can't promise that." 

The Doctor was silent a minute. " I ask you for a 
particular reason. I am altering my will." 

This reason failed to strike Catherine ; and indeed 
she scarcely understood it. All her feelings were 
merged in the sense that he was trying to treat her 
as he had treated her years before. She had suffered 
from it then ; and now all her experience, all her 
acquired tranquillity and rigidity protested. She 
had been so humble in her youth that she could 
now afford to have a little pride, and there was some- 
thing in this request, and in her father's thinking 
himself so free to make it, that seemed an injury to 
her dignity. Poor Catherine's dignity was not ag- 
gressive; it never sat in state; but if you pushed 
far enough you could find it. Her father had push- 
ed very far. 

" I can't promise," she simply repeated. 

" You are very obstinate," said the Doctor. 

" I don't think you understand." 

"Please explain, then." 

" I can't explain," said Catherine ; " and I can't 
promise." 

" Upon my word," her father exclaimed, " I had 
no idea how obstinate you are !" 

She knew herself that she was obstinate, and it 
gave her a certain joy. She was now a middle-aged 
woman. 

About a year after this, the accident that the Doc- 
tor had spoken of occurred : he took a violent cold. 





Driving out to Bloomingdale one April day to see 
a patient of unsound mind, who was confined in a 
private asylum for the insane, and whose family 
greatly desired a medical opinion from an eminent 
source, he was caught in a spring shower., and being 
in a buggy, without a hood, he found himself soaked 
to the skin. He came home with an ominous chill, 
and on the morrow he was seriously ill. " It is con- 
gestion of the lungs," he said to Catherine ; " I shall 
need very good nursing. It will make no differ- 
ence, for I shall not recover ; but I wish everything 
to be done, to the smallest detail, as if I should. I 
hate an ill-conducted sick-room, and you will be so 
good as to nurse me, on the hypothesis that I shall 
get well." He told her which of his fellow-physi- 
cians to send for, and gave her a multitude of mi- 
nute directions ; it was quite on the optimistic hy- 
pothesis that she nursed him. But he had never 
been wrong in his life, and he was not wrong now. 
He was touching his seventieth year, and though he 
had a very well-tempered constitution, his hold upon 
life had lost its firmness. He died after three weeks' 
illness, during which Mrs. Penniman, as well as his 
daughter, had been assiduous at his bedside. 

On his will being opened, after a decent interval, 
it was found to consist of two portions. The first 
of these dated from ten years back, and consisted of 
a series of dispositions by which he left the great 
mass of his property to his daughter, with becoming 
legacies to his two sisters. The second was a codicil, 
of recent origin, maintaining the annuities to Mrs. 
Penniman and .Mrs. Almond, but reducing Cathe- 
rine's share to a fifth of what he had first bequeathed 





her. " She is amply provided for from her moth- 
er's side," the document ran, " never having spent 
more than a fraction of her income from this source ; 
so that her fortune is already more than sufficient to 
attract those unscrupulous adventurers whom she 
has given me reason to believe that she persists in 
regarding as an interesting class." The large re- 
mainder of his property, therefore, Doctor Sloper 
had divided into seven unequal parts, which he left, 
as endowments, to as many different hospitals and 
schools of medicine in various cities of the Union. 

To Mrs. Penniman it seemed monstrous that a 
man should play such tricks with other people's 
money ; for after his death, of course, as she said, 
it was other people's. " Of course, you will imme- 
diately break the will," she remarked to Catherine. 

" Oh no," Catherine answered, " I like it very 
much. Only I wish it had been expressed a little 
differently!" 



XXXIY. 

IT was her habit to remain in town very late in 
the summer; she preferred the house in Washing- 
ton Square to any other habitation whatever, and it 
was under protest that she used to go to the sea-side 
for the month of August. At the sea she spent her 
month at an hotel. The year that her father died 
she intermitted this custom altogether, not thinking 
it consistent with deep mourning ; and the year af- 
ter that she put off her departure till so late that the 
middle of August found her still in the heated soli- 





tude of Washington Square. Mrs. Penniman, who 
was fond of a change, was usually eager for a visit 
to the country ; but this year she appeared quite 
content with such rural impressions as she could 
gather at the parlor- window from the ailantus-trees 
behind the wooden paling. The peculiar fragrance 
of this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the even- 
ing air, and Mrs. Penniman, on the warm nights of 
July, often sat at the open window and inhaled it. 
This was a happy moment for Mrs. Penniman ; af- 
ter the death of her brother she felt more free to 
obey her impulses. A vague oppression had disap- 
peared from her life, and she enjoyed a sense of 
freedom of which she had not been conscious since 
the memorable time, so long ago, when the Doctor 
went abroad with Catherine and left her at home to 
entertain Morris Townsend. The year that had 
elapsed since her brother's death reminded her of 
that happy time, because, although Catherine, in 
growing older, had become a person to be reckoned 
with, yet her society was a very different thing, as 
Mrs. Penniman said, from that of a tank of cold wa- 
ter. The elder lady hardly knew what use to make 
of this larger margin of her life ; she sat and looked 
at it very much as she had often sat, with her poised 
needle in her hand, before her tapestry-frame. She 
had a confident hope, however, that her rich im- 
pulses, her talent for embroidery, would still find 
their application, and this confidence was justified 
before many months had elapsed. 

Catherine continued to live in her father's house, 
in spite of its being represented to her that a maid- 
en lady of quiet habits might find a more conven- 





lent abode in one of the smaller dwellings, with 
brown stone fronts, which had at this time begun to 
adorn the transverse thoroughfares in the upper part 
of the town. She liked the earlier structure it had 
begun by this time to be called an " old " house 
and proposed to herself to end her days in it. If it 
was too large for a pair of unpretending gentlewom- 
en, this was better than the opposite fault; for Cathe- 
rine had no desire to find herself in closer quarters 
with her aunt. She expected to spend the rest of 
her life in Washington Square, and to enjoy Mrs. 
Penniman's society for the whole of this period ; as 
she had a conviction that, long as she might live, 
her aunt would live at least as long, and always re- 
tain her brilliancy and activity. Mrs. Penniman 
suggested to her the idea of a rich vitality. 

On one of those warm evenings in July of which 
mention has been made, the two ladies sat together 
at an open window, looking out on the quiet Square. 
It was too hot for lighted lamps, for reading, or for 
work ; it might have appeared too hot even for con- 
versation, Mrs. Penniman having long been speech- 
less. She sat forward in the window, half on the 
balcony, humming a little song. Catherine was with- 
in the room, in a low rocking-chair, dressed in white, 
and slowly using a large palmetto fan. It was in 
this way, at this season, that the aunt and niece, after 
they had had tea, habitually spent their evenings. 

" Catherine," said Mrs. Penniman at last, " I am 
going to say something that will surprise you." 

"Pray do," Catherine answered ; "I like surprises. 
And it is so quiet now." 

" Well, then, I have seen Morris Townsend." 





If Catherine was surprised, she checked the ex- 
pression of it ; she gave neither a start nor an ex- 
clamation. She remained, indeed, for some mo- 
ments intensely still, and this may very well have 
been a symptom of emotion. " I hope he was well," 
she said at last. 

" I don't know ; he is a great deal changed. He 
would like very much to see you." 

"I would rather not see him," said Catherine, 
quickly. 

" I was afraid you would say that. But you don't 
seem surprised !" 

" I am very much." 

" I met him at Marian's," said Mrs. Penniman. 
" He goes to Marian's, and they are so afraid you 
will meet him there. It's my belief that that's why 
he goes. He wants so much to see you." Cathe- 
rine made no response to this, and Mrs. Penniman 
went on. "I didn't know him at first, he is so re- 
markably changed; but he knew me in a minute. 
He says I am not in the least changed. You know 
how polite he always was. He was coming away 
when I came, and we walked a little distance to- 
gether. He is still very handsome, only of course 
he looks older, and he is not so so animated 
as he used to be. There was a touch of sadness 
about him ; but there was a touch of sadness about 
him before, especially when he went away. I am 
afraid he has not been very successful that he has 
never got thoroughly established. I don't suppose 
he is sufficiently plodding, and that, after all, is what 
succeeds in this world." Mrs. Penniman had not 
mentioned Morris Townsend's name to her niece for 





upwards of the fifth of a century ; but now that she 
had broken the spell, she seemed to wish to make 
up for lost time, as if there had been a sort of ex- 
hilaration in hearing herself talk of him. She pro- 
ceeded, however, with considerable caution, pausing 
occasionally to let Catherine give some sign. Cathe- 
rine gave no other sign than to stop the rocking of 
her chair and the swaying of her fan ; she sat mo- 
tionless and silent. " It was on Tuesday last," said 
Mrs. Penniman, " and I have been hesitating ever 
since about telling you. I didn't know how you 
might like it. At last I thought that it was so long 
ago that yon would probably not have any particu- 
lar feeling. I saw him again after meeting him at 
Marian's. I met him in the street, and he went a 
few steps with me. The first thing he said was 
about you ; he asked ever so many questions. Ma- 
rian didn't want me to speak to you ; she didn't 
want you to know that they receive him. I told 
him I was sure that after all these years you couldn't 
have any feeling about that ; you couldn't grudge 
him the hospitality of his own cousin's house. I 
said you would be bitter indeed if you did that. 
Marian has the most extraordinary ideas about what 
happened between you; she seems to think he be- 
haved in some very unusual manner. I took the 
liberty of reminding her of the real facts, and plac- 
ing the story in its true light. He has no bitterness, 
Catherine, I can assure you ; and he might be ex- 
cused for it, for things have not gone well with him. 
He has been all over the world, and tried to estab- 
lish himself everywhere ; but his evil star was against 
him. It is most interesting to hear him talk of his 





evil star. Everything failed ; everything but his 
you know, you remember his proud, high spirit. 
I believe he married some lady somewhere in Europe. 
You know they marry in such a peculiar matter-of- 
course way in Europe; a marriage of reason they 
call it. She died soon afterward ; as he said to me, 
she only flitted across his life. He has not been in 
New York for ten years ; he came back a few days 
ago. The first thing he did was to ask me about 
you. He had heard you had never married ; he 
seemed very much interested about that. He said 
you had been the real romance of his life." 

Catherine had suffered her companion to proceed 
from point to point, and pause to pause, without in- 
terrupting her; she fixed her eyes on the ground 
and listened. But the last phrase I have quoted was 
followed by a pause of peculiar significance, and then, 
at last, Catherine spoke. It will be observed that 
before doing so she had received a good deal of in- 
formation about Morris Townsend. " Please say no 
more ; please don't follow up that subject." 

" Doesn't it interest you ?" asked Mrs. Penniman, 
with a certain timorous archness. 

" It pains me," said Catherine. 

" I was afraid you would say that. But don't you 
think you could get used to it ? He wants so much 
to see you." 

" Please don't, Aunt Lavinia," said Catherine, get- 
ting up from her seat. She moved quickly away, 
and went to the other window, which stood open to 
the balcony ; and here, in the embrasure, concealed 
from her aunt by the white curtains, she remained 
a long time, looking out into the warm darkness. 





She had had a great shock ; it was as if the gulf of 
the past had suddenly opened, and a spectral figure 
had risen out of it. There were some things she 
believed she had got over, some feelings that she 
had thought of as dead; but apparently there was 
a certain vitality in them still. Mrs. Penniman had 
made them stir themselves. It was but a momen- 
tary agitation, Catherine said to herself; it would 
presently pass away. She was trembling, and her 
heart was beating so that she could feel it ; but this 
also would subside. Then suddenly, while she wait- 
ed for a return of her calmness, she burst into tears. 
But her tears flowed very silently, so that Mrs. Pen- 
nirnan had no observation of them. It was perhaps, 
however, because Mrs. Penniman suspected them 
that she said no more that evening about Morris 
Townsend. 



XXXV. 

HER refreshed attention to this gentleman had 
not those limits of which Catherine desired, for her- 
self, to be conscious ; it lasted long enough to enable 
her to wait another week before speaking of him 
again. It was under the same circumstances that 
she once more attacked the subject. She had been 
sitting with her niece in the evening; only on this 
occasion, as the night was not so warm, the lamp 
had been lighted, and Catherine had placed herself 
near it with a morsel of fancy-work. Mrs. Penni- 
man went and sat alone for half an hour on the bal- 
cony ; then she came in, moving vaguely about the 





room. At last she sunk into a seat near Catherine, 
with clasped hands, and a little look of excitement. 

" Shall you be angry if I speak to you again about 
him ?" she asked. 

Catherine looked up at her quietly. " Who is he ?" 

"He whom you once loved." 

" I shall not be angry, but I shall not like it." 

"He sent you a message," said Mrs. Penniman. 
" I promised him to deliver it, and I must keep my 
promise." 

In all these years Catherine had had time to for- 
get how little she had to thank her aunt for in the 
season of her misery ; she had long ago forgiven 
Mrs. Penniman for taking too much upon herself. 
But for a moment this attitude of interposition and 
disinterestedness, this carrying of messages and re- 
deeming of promises, brought back the sense that 
her companion was a dangerous woman. She had 
said she would not be angry ; but for an instant she 
felt sore. "I don't care what you do with your 
promise !" she answered. 

Mrs. Penniman, however, with her high concep- 
tion of the sanctity of pledges, carried her point. 
" I have gone too far to retreat," she said, though 
precisely what this meant she was not at pains to 
explain. " Mr. Townsend wishes most particularly 
to see you, Catherine ; he believes that if you knew 
how much, and why, he wishes it, you would con- 
sent to do so." 

" There can be no reason," said Catherine ; " no 
good reason." 

" His happiness depends upon it. Is not that a 
good reason ?" asked Mrs. Penniman, impressively. 







" Not for me. My happiness does not." 

" I think you will be happier after you have seen 
him. He is going away again going to resume 
his wanderings. It is a very lonely, restless, joyless 
life. Before he goes he wishes to speak to you ; it 
is a fixed idea with him he is always thinking of 
it. He has something very important to say to you. 
He believes that you never understood him that 
you never judged him rightly, and the belief has al- 
ways weighed upon him terribly. He wishes to jus- 
tify himself; he believes that in a very few words 
he could do so. He wishes to meet you as a 
friend." 

Catherine listened to this wonderful speech with- 
out pausing in her work ; she had now had several 
days to accustom herself to think of Morris Town- 
send again as an actuality. When it was over she 
said simply, " Please say to Mr. Townsend that I wish 
he would leave me alone." 

She had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at 
the door vibrated through the summer night. Cath- 
erine looked up at the clock; it marked a quarter
