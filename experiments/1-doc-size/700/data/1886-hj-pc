eminence and success these things were seated in triumph 
in the face of the Princess, and Hyacinth, as he held 
himself in his chair, trembling with the revelation, wondered 
whether she were not altogether of some different substance 
from the humanity he had hitherto known. She might be 
divine, but he could see that she understood human needs 
that she wished him to be at his ease and happy ; there 
was something familiar in her smile, as if she had seen him 





many times before. Her dress was dark and rich ; she had 
pearls round her neck, and an old rococo fan in her hand. 
Hyacinth took in all these things, and finally said to himself 
that if she wanted nothing more of him than that, he was 
content, he would like it to go on ; so pleasant was it to sit 
with fine ladies, in a dusky, spacious receptacle which 
framed the bright picture of the stage and made one's own 
situation seem a play within the play. The act was a long 
one, and the repose in which his companions left him might 
have been a calculated indulgence, to enable him to get 
used to them, to see how harmless they were. He looked 
at Millicent, in the course of time, and saw that Captain 
Sholto, seated beside her, had not the same standard of 
propriety, inasmuch as he made a remark to her every few 
minutes. Like himself, the young lady in the balcony was 
losing the play, thanks to her eyes being fixed on her friend 
from Lomax Place, whose position she thus endeavoured to 
gauge. Hyacinth had quite given up the Paraguayan com- 
plications ; by the end of the half hour his attention might 
have come back to them, had he not then been engaged in 
wondering whaj: the Princess would say to him after the 
descent of the curtain or whether she would say anything. 
The consideration of this problem, as the moment of the 
solution drew nearer, made his heart again beat faster. He 
watched the old lady on his left, and supposed it was 
natural that a princess should have an attendant he took 
for granted she was an attendant as different as possible 
from herself. This ancient dame was without majesty or 
grace; huddled together, with her hands folded on her 
stomach and her lips protruding, she solemnly followed the 
performance. Several times, however, she turned her head 



 

to Hyacinth, and then her expression changed ; she repeated 
the jovial, encouraging, almost motherly nod with which she 
had greeted him when he had made his bow, and by which 
she appeared to wish to intimate that, better than the serene 
beauty on the other side, she could enter into the oddity, 
the discomfort, of his situation. She seemed to say to him 
that he must keep his head, and that if the worst should 
come to the worst she was there to look after him. Even 
when, at last, the curtain descended, it was some moments 
before the Princess spoke, though she rested her smile upon 
Hyacinth as if she were considering what he would best like 
her to say. He might at that instant have guessed what he 
discovered later that among this lady's faults (he was 
destined to learn that they were numerous), not the least 
eminent was an exaggerated fear of the commonplace. He 
expected she would make some remark about the play, but 
what she said was, very gently and kindly, ' I like to know 
all sorts of people.' 

' I shouldn't think you would find the least difficulty in 
that,' Hyacinth replied. 

' Oh, if one wants anything very much, it's sure to be 
difficult. Every one isn't as obliging as you.' 

Hyacinth could think, immediately, of no proper re- 
joinder to this ; but the old lady saved him the trouble by 
declaring, with a foreign accent, ' I think you were most 
extraordinarily good-natured. I had no idea you would 
come to two strange women.' 

' Yes, we are strange women,' said the Princess, musingly. 

' It's not true that she finds things difficult ; she makes 
every one do everything,' her companion went on. 

The Princess glanced at her ; then remarked to Hyacinth, 





' Her name is Madame Grandoni.' Her tone was not 
familiar, but there was a friendly softness in it, as if he had 
really taken so much trouble for them that it was only 
just he should be entertained a little at their expense. It 
seemed to imply, also, that Madame Grandoni's fitness for 
supplying such entertainment was obvious. 

' But I am not Italian ah no !' the old lady cried. 
' In spite of my name, I am an honest, ugly, unfortunate 
German. But it doesn't matter. She, also, with such a 
name, isn't Italian, either. It's an accident ; the world is 
full of accidents. But she isn't German, poor lady, any 
more.' Madame Grandoni appeared to have entered into 
the Princess's view, and Hyacinth thought her exceedingly 
amusing. In a moment she added, 'That was a very 
charming person you were with.' 

4 Yes, she is very charming,' Hyacinth replied, not sorry 
to have a chance to say it. 

The Princess made no remark on this subject, and 
Hyacinth perceived not only that from her position in the 
box she could have had no glimpse of Millicent, but that 
she would never, take up such an allusion as that. It was 
as if she had not heard it that she asked, ' Do you consider 
the play very interesting?' 

Hyacinth hesitated a moment, and then told the simple 
truth. ' I must confess that I have lost the whole of this 
last act.' 

' Ah, poor bothered young man ! ' cried Madame Gran- 
doni. ' You see; you see ! ' 

' What do I see ? ' the Princess inquired. ' If you are 
annoyed at being here now, you will like us later ; probably, 
at feast. We take a great interest in the things you care 



for. We take a great interest in the people,' the Princess 
went on. 

' Oh, allow me, allow me, and speak only for yourself ! ' 
the elder lady interposed. ' I take no interest in the 
people; I don't understand them, and I know nothing 
about them. An honourable nature, of any class, I 
always respect it ; but I will not pretend to a passion for 
the ignorant masses, because I have it not. Moreover, 
that doesn't touch the gentleman.' 

The Princess Casamassima had, evidently, a faculty of 
completely ignoring things of which she wished to take no 
account ; it was not in the least the air of contempt, but 
a kind of thoughtful, tranquil absence, after which she came 
back to the point where she wished to be. She made no 
protest against her companion's speech, but said to Hyacinth, 
as if she were only vaguely conscious that the old lady 
had been committing herself in some absurd way, ' She 
lives with me; she is everything to me; she is the best 
woman in the world.' 

' Yes, fortunately, with many superficial defects, I am 
very good,' Madame Grandoni remarked. 

Hyacinth, by this time, was less embarrassed than when 
he presented himself to the Princess Casamassima, but he 
was not less mystified ; he wondered afresh whether he 
were not being practised upon for some inconceivable end ; 
so strange did it seem to him that two such fine ladies 
should, of their own movement, take the trouble to explain 
each other to a miserable little bookbinder. This idea 
made him flush ; it was as if it had come over him that he 
had fallen into a trap. He was conscious that he looked 
frightened, and he was conscious the moment afterwards 





that the Princess noticed it. This was, apparently, what 
made her say, 'If you have lost so much of the play I 
ought to tell you what has happened.' 

' Do you think he would follow that any more?' Madame 
Grandoni exclaimed. 

' If you would tell me if you would tell me ' And 

then Hyacinth stopped. He had been going to say, 'If 
you would tell me what all this means and what you want 
of me, it would be more to the point ! ' but the words died 
on his lips, and he sat staring, for the woman at his right 
hand was simply too beautiful. She was too beautiful to 
question, to judge by common logic ; and how could he 
know, moreover, what was natural to a person in that 
exaltation of grace and splendour? Perhaps it was her 
habit to send out every evening for some naif stranger, to 
amuse her; perhaps that was the way the foreign aris- 
tocracy lived. There was no sharpness in her face, at the 
present moment at least ; there was nothing but luminous 
sweetness, yet she looked as if she knew what was going on 
in his mind. She made no eager attempt to reassure him, 
but there was a world of delicate consideration in the tone 
in which she said, ' Do you know, I am afraid I have already 
forgotten what they have been doing in the play? It's 
terribly complicated ; some one or other was hurled over 
a precipice.' 

' Ah, you're a brilliant pair,' Madame Grandoni remarked, 
with a laugh of long experience. ' I could describe every- 
thing. The person who was hurled over the precipice was 
the virtuous hero, and you will see, in the next act, that 
he was only slightly bruised.' 

' Don't describe anything ; I have so much to ask.' 



 

Hyacinth had looked away, in tacit deprecation, at hearing 
himself ' paired ' with the Princess, and he felt that she 
was watching him. 'What do you think of Captain 
Sholto ? ' she went on, suddenly, to his surprise, if any- 
thing, in his position, could excite that sentiment more 
than anything else ; and as he hesitated, not knowing what 
to say, she added, ' Isn't he a very curious type ?' 

' I know him very little,' Hyacinth replied ; and he had 
no sooner uttered the words than it struck him they were 
far from brilliant they were poor and flat, and very little 
calculated to satisfy the Princess. Indeed, he reflected 
that he had said nothing at all that could place him in a 
favourable light ; so he continued, at a venture : ' I mean 
I have never seen him at home. That sounded still more.



' At home ? Oh, he is never at home ; he is all over 
the world. To-night he was as likely to have been in 
Paraguay, for instance, as here. He is what they call a 
cosmopolite. I don't know whether you know that species ; 
very modern, more and more frequent, and exceedingly 
tiresome. I prefer the Chinese ! He had told me he had 
had a great deal of interesting talk with you. That was 
what made me say to him, " Oh, do ask him to come in 
and see me. A little interesting talk, that would be a 
change!"' 

' She is very complimentary to me ! ' said Madame 
Grandoni. 

4 Ah, my dear, you and I, you know, we never talk : we 
understand each other without that ! ' Then the Princess 
pursued, addressing herself to Hyacinth, 'Do you never 
admit women ? ' 





' Admit women ? ' 

'Into those seances what do you call them? those 
little meetings that Captain Sholto described to me. I 
should like so much to be present. Why not ?' 

' I haven't seen any ladies Hyacinth said. ' I don't 
know whether it's a rule, but I have seen nothing but 
men ;' and he added, smiling, though he thought the 
dereliction rather serious, and couldn't understand the 
part Captain Sholto was playing, nor, considering the 
grand company he kept, how he had originally secured 
admittance into the subversive little circle in Bloomsbury, 
' You know I'm not sure Captain Sholto ought to go about 
reporting our proceedings.' 

' I see. Perhaps you think he's a spy, or something of 
that sort.' 

' No,' said Hyacinth, after a moment. ' I think a spy 
would be more careful would disguise himself more. 
Besides, after all, he has heard very little.' And Hyacinth 
smiled again. 

'You mean he hasn't really been behind the scenes?' 
the Princess asked, bending forward a little, and now 
covering the young man steadily with her deep, soft eyes, 
as if by this time he must have got used to her and 
wouldn't flinch from such attention. ' Of course he hasn't, 
and he never will be ; he knows that, and that it's quite 
out of his power to tell any real secrets. What he repeated 
to me was interesting, but of course I could see that there 
was nothing the authorities, anywhere, could put their hand 
on. It was mainly the talk he had had with you which 
struck him so very much, and which struck me, as you see. 
Perhaps you didn't know how he was drawing you out.' 



  



I am afraid that's rather easy,' said Hyacinth, with 
perfect candour, as it came over him that he had chattered, 
with a vengeance, in Bloomsbury, and had thought it 
natural enough then that his sociable fellow-visitor should 
offer him cigars and attach importance to the views of a 
clever and original young artisan. 

' I am not sure that I find it so ! However, I ought to 
tell you that you needn't have the least fear of Captain 
Sholto. He's a perfectly honest man, so far as he goes ; 
and even if you had trusted him much more than you 
appear to have done, he would be incapable of betraying 
you. However, don't trust him : not because he's not 

safe, but because No matter, you will see for yourself. 

He has gone into that sort of thing simply to please me. 
I should tell you, merely to" make you understand, that 
he would do anything for that. That's his own affair. I 
wanted to know something, to learn something, to ascertain 
what really is going on ; and for a woman everything of 
that sort is so difficult, especially for a woman in my posi- 
tion, who is known, and to whom every sort of bad faith is 
sure to be imputed. So Sholto said he would look into 
the subject for me ; poor man, he has had to look into so 
many subjects ! What I particularly wanted was that he 
should make friends with some of the leading spirits, 
really characteristic types.' The Princess's voice was low 
and rather deep, and her tone very quick ; her manner of 
speaking was altogether new to her listener, for whom the 
pronunciation of her words and the very punctuation of 
her sentences were a kind of revelation of ' society.' 

' Surely Captain Sholto doesn't suppose that I am a 
leading spirit !' Hyacinth exclaimed, with the determi- 





nation not to be laughed at any more than he could 
help. 

The Princess hesitated a moment ; then she said, ' He 
told me you were very original.' 

' He doesn't know, and if you will allow me to say so 
I don't think you know. How should you ? I am one 
of many thousands of young men of my class you know, 
I suppose, what that is in whose brains certain ideas are 
fermenting. There is nothing original about me at all. I 
am very young and very ignorant ; it's only a few months 
since I began to talk of the possibility of a social revolution 
with men who have considered the whole ground much 
more than I have done. I'm a mere particle in the im- 
mensity of the people. All I pretend to is my good faith, 
and a great desire that justice shall be done.' 

The Princess listened to him intently, and her attitude 
made him feel how little ie, in comparison, expressed him- 
self like a person who had the habit of conversation ; he 
seemed to himself to stammer and emit common sounds. 
For a moment she said nothing, only looking at him with 
her pure smile. ' I do draw you out !' she exclaimed, at 
last. ' You are much more interesting to me than if you 
were an exception.' At these last words Hyacinth flinched 
a hair's breadth ; the movement was shown by his dropping 
his eyes. We know to what extent he really regarded him- 
self as of the stuff of the common herd. The Princess 
doubtless guessed it as well, for she quickly added, ' At the 
same time, I can see that you are remarkable enough.' 

' What do you think I am remarkable for ? ' 

' Well, you have general ideas.' 

'Every one has them to-day. They have them in 



 

Bloomsbury to a terrible degree. I have a friend (who 
understands the matter much better than I) who has no 
patience with them : he declares they are our danger and 
our bane. A few very special ideas if they are the right 
ones are what we want.' 

' Who is your friend ? ' the Princess asked, abruptly. 

'Ah, Christina, Christina,' Madame Grandoni mur- 
mured from the other side of the box. 

Christina took no notice of her, and Hyacinth, not 
understanding the warning, and only remembering how 
personal women always are, replied, 'A young man who 
lives in Camberwell, an assistant at a wholesale chemist's.' 

If he had expected that this description of his friend 
was a bigger dose than his hostess would be able to digest, 
he was greatly mistaken. She seemed to look tenderly at 
the picture suggested by his words, and she immediately 
inquired whether the young man were also clever, and 
whether she might not hope to know him. Hadn't Captain 
Sholto seen him ; and if so, why hadn't he spoken of him, 
too ? When Hyacinth had replied that Captain Sholto had 
probably seen him, but that he believed he had had no 
particular conversation with him, the Princess inquired, 
with startling frankness, whether her visitor wouldn't bring 
his friend, some day, to see her. 

Hyacinth glanced at Madame Grandoni, but that 
worthy woman was engaged in a survey of the house, 
through an old-fashioned eye-glass with a long gilt handle. 
He had perceived, long before this, that the Princess 
Casamassima had no desire for vain phrases, and he had 
the good taste to feel that, from himself to such a per- 
sonage, compliments, even if he had wished to pay them, 





would have had no suitability. ' I don't know whether he 
would be willing to come. He's the sort of man that, in 
such a case, you can't answer for.' 

' That makes me want to know him all the more. But 
you'll come yourself, at all events, eh ? ' 

Poor Hyacinth murmured something about the un- 
expected honour ; for, after all, he had a French heredity, 
and it was not so easy for him to make unadorned speeches. 
But Madame Grandoni, laying down her eye-glass, almost 
took the words out of his mouth, with the cheerful exhor- 
tation, ' Go and see her go and see her once or twice. 
She will treat you like an angel.' 

'You must think me very peculiar,' the Princess re- 
marked, sadly. 

' I don't know what I think. It will take a good while.' 

' I wish I could make you trust me inspire you with 
confidence,' she went on. ' I don't mean only you, per- 
sonally, but others who think as you do. You would find 
I would go with you-=-pretty far. I was answering just 
now for Captain Sholto ; but who in the world is to 
answer for me i) ' And her sadness merged itself in a smile 
which appeared to Hyacinth extraordinarily magnanimous 
and touching. 

' Not I, my dear, I promise you ! ' her ancient com- 
panion ejaculated, with a laugh which made the people in 
the stalls look up at the box. 

Her mirth was contagious ; it gave Hyacinth the auda- 
city to say to her, ' I would trust you, if you did ! ' though 
he felt, the next minute, that this was even a more familiar 
speech than if he had said he wouldn't trust her. 

' It comes, then, to the same thing,' the Princess went 



 

on. ' She would not show herself with me in public if I 
were not respectable. If you knew more about me you 
would understand what has led me to turn my attention to 
the great social question. It is a long story, and the 
details wouldn't interest you ; but perhaps some day, if we 
have more talk, you will put yourself a little in my place. 
I am very serious, you know ; I am not amusing myself 
with peeping and running away. I am convinced that we 
are living in a fool's paradise, that the ground is heaving 
under our feet.' 

' It's not the ground, my dear ; it's you that are turning 
somersaults,' Madame Grandoni interposed. 

'Ah, you, my friend, you have the happy faculty of 
believing what you like to believe. I have to believe what 
I see.' 

' She wishes to throw herself into the revolution, to 
guide it, to enlighten it,' Madame Grandoni said to Hya- 
cinth, speaking now with imperturbable gravity. 

' I am sure she could direct it- in any sense she would 
wish ! ' the young man responded, in a glow. The pure, 
high dignity with which the Princess had just spoken, 
and which appeared to cover a suppressed tremor of 
passion, set Hyacinth's pulses throbbing, and though he 
scarcely saw what she meant her aspirations seeming so 
vague her tone, her voice, her wonderful face, showed 
that she had a generous soul. 

She answered his eager declaration with a serious smile 
and a melancholy head-shake. ' I have no such preten- 
sions, and my good old friend is laughing at me. Of 
course that is very easy ; for what, in fact, can be more 
absurd, on the face of it, than for a woman with a title, 





with diamonds, with a carriage, with servants, with a 
position, as they call it, to sympathise with the upward 
struggles of those who are below? "Give all that up, 
and we'll believe you," you have a right to say. I am 
ready to give them up the moment it will help the cause ; 
I assure you that's the least difficulty. I don't want to 
teach, I want to learn ; and, above all, I want to know 
a quoi m'en tenir. Are we on the eve of great changes, 
or are we not? Is everything that is gathering force, 
underground, in the dark, in the night, in little hidden 
rooms, out of sight of governments and policemen and 
idiotic " statesmen " heaven save them ! is all this going 
to burst forth some fine morning and set the world on 
fire ? Or is it to sputter out and spend itself in vain con- 
spiracies, be dissipated in sterile heroisms and abortive 
isolated movements ? I want to know a quoi m'en tenir] 
she repeated, fixing her visitor with more brilliant eyes, as 
if he could tell her on the spot. Then, suddenly, she 
added in a totally different tone, ' Excuse me, I have an 
idea you speak French. Didn't Captain Sholto tell me so?' 

' I have some little acquaintance with it,' Hyacinth mur- 
mured. ' I have French blood in my veins.' 

She considered him as if he had proposed to her some 
kind of problem. ' Yes, I can see that you are not 
le premier venu. Now, your friend, of whom you were 
speaking, is a chemist; and you, yourself what is your 
occupation ? ' 

' I'm just a bookbinder.' 

' That must be delightful. I wonder if you would bind 
some books for me.' 

' You would have to bring them to our shop, and I can 



 

do there only the work that's given out to me. I might 
manage it by myself, at home,' Hyacinth added, smiling. 

' I should like that better. And what do you call 
home ? ' 

' The place I live in, in the north of London : a little 
street you certainly never heard of.' 

' What is it called ? ' 

' Lomax Place, at your service,' said Hyacinth, laughing 

She laughed back at him, and he didn't know whether 
her brightness or her gravity were the more charming. 
' No, I don't think I have heard of it. I don't know Lon- 
don very well ; I haven't lived here long. I have spent 
most of my life abroad. My husband is a foreigner, an 
Italian. We don't live together much. I haven't the 
manners of this country not of any class ; have I, eh ? 
Oh, this country there is a great deal to be said about it; 
and a great deal to be done, as you, of course, understand 
better than any one. But I want to know London ; it 
interests me more than I can say the huge, swarming, 
smoky, human city. I mean real London, the people and 
all their sufferings and passions ; not Park Lane and Bond 
Street. Perhaps you can help me it would be a great 
kindness : that's what I want to know men like you for. 
You see it isn't idle, my having given you so much trouble 
to-night' 

'I shall be very glad to show you all I know. But 
it isn't much, and above all it isn't pretty,' said Hyacinth. 

' Whom do you live with, in Lomax Place ? ' the Prin- 
cess asked, by way of rejoinder to this. 

( Captain Sholto is leaving the young lady he is coming 
back here,' Madame Grandoni announced, inspecting the 


balcony with her instrument. The orchestra had been for 
some time playing the overture to the following act. 

Hyacinth hesitated a moment. ' I live with a dress- 
maker.' 

' With a dressmaker ? Do you mean do you mean 
?' And the Princess paused. 

' Do you mean she's your wife ? ' asked Madame Gran- 
el on i, humorously. 

' Perhaps she gives you rooms.' remarked the Princess. 

' How many do you think I have ? She gives me 
everything, or she has done so in the past She brought 
me up ; she is the best little woman in the world.' 

' You had better command a dress ! ' exclaimed Madame 
Grandoni. 

' And your family, where are they ? ' the Princess con- 
tinued. 

' I have no family.' 

' None at all ? ' 

' None at all. I never had.' 

' But the French blood that you speak of, and which I 
see perfectly in your face you haven't the English expres- 
sion, or want' of expression that must have come to you 
through some one.' 

' Yes, through my mother.' 

' And she is dead ? ' 

'Long ago.' 

' That's a great loss, because French mothers are usually 
so much to their sons.' The Princess looked at her 
painted fan a moment, as she opened and closed it ; after 
which she said, ' Well, then, yo,u'll come some day. We'll 
arrange it.' 



 

Hyacinth felt that the answer to this could be only 
a silent inclination of his little person ; and to make it he 
rose from his chair. As he stood there, conscious that he 
had stayed long enough and yet not knowing exactly how to 
withdraw, the Princess, with her fan closed, resting upright 
on her knee, and her hands clasped on the end of it, turned 
up her strange, lovely eyes at him, and said 

' Do you think anything will occur soon ? ' 

' Will occur?' 

' That there will be a crisis that you'll make yourselves 
felt ? ' 

In this beautiful woman's face there was to Hyacinth's 
bewildered perception something at once inspiring, tempting 
and mocking ; and the effect of her expression was to make 
him say, rather clumsily, ' I'll try and ascertain ; ' as if she 
had asked him whether her carriage were at the door. 

' I don't quite know what you are talking about ; but 
please don't have it for another hour or two. I want to see 
what becomes of the Pearl ! ' Madame Grandoni interposed. 

' Remember what I told you : I would give up every- 
thing everything ! ' the Princess went on, looking up at 
the young man in the same way. Then she held out her 
hand, and this time he knew sufficiently what he was about 
to take it. 

When he bade good-night to Madame Grandoni the old 
lady exclaimed to him, with a comical sigh, ' Well, she is 
respectable ! ' and out in the lobby, when he had closed the 
door of the box behind him, he found himself echoing these 
words and repeating mechanically, ' She is respectable ! ' 
They were on his lips as he stood, suddenly, face to face 
with Captain Sholto, who laid his hand on his shoulder 





once more and shook him a little, in that free yet insinu- 
ating manner for which this officer appeared to be remark- 
able. 

' My dear fellow, you were born under a lucky star.' 
' I never supposed it', said Hyacinth, changing colour. 
'Why, what in the world would you have? You have 
the faculty, the precious faculty, of inspiring women with 
an interest but an interest ! ' 

' Yes, ask them in the box there ! I behaved like a 
cretin,' Hyacinth declared, overwhelmed now with a sense 
of opportunities missed. 

' They won't tell me that. And the lady upstairs ? ' 
' Well,' said Hyacinth gravely, ' what about her ? ' 
The Captain considered him a moment. ' She wouldn't 
talk to me of anything but you. You may imagine how I 
liked it ! '
