now that she might have fallen into less scrapulous hands 
and never emerged from the wreck. She has been in a 
degree thankless ; she has not paid him the high respect 
due the steady manful virtae he has shown all these years. 
In her heart a strange pity springs up for him, a sympa- 
thy that is at once yearning and intense. Can she do 
anything to raise Dolly to purer heights of womanhood, to 
make her more companionable for such a man? Yet why 
did he choose her? And Miss Ormiston's brow knits in 
unwonted perplexity. He had always kno¥m her, he 
could not have been blinded or led astray. But she is cer- 
tain there is no deep, vital love between them. 

Lehton St. George is in unknown secret sympathy 
with her. Here in the old room where he has studied 
out problems, planned and discussed with Donaldson, 
dreamed his own elusive, delightful visions of some fame 
and much enjoyment, he sits pondering the great blunder 
he has made against his own better judgment ; the devas- 
tation he has brought into his life by an act of unwonted 
momentary sympathy. If Dolly had not come to Glen 
Ormiston, if he had always seen her in the worid to which 
she belonged, he might not have been so positively con- 
fronted with it. But beside this pure, delicate woman- 
hood, whose very independence has always been a curious 
bugbear, she drops down into a narrow, self-willed, vapid, 
unreasonable child, a burden, nay, worse, for a simple 
burden might be bravely borne ; but to have the continual 
fret of a frivolous and insignificant nature, that can have 
no access to higher things, is terrible. 

And then to be misunderstood or uncomprehended by 
this larger, broader soul, with its serene strength for the 
great duties of life, its keen and perfect appreciation for 
all that is graceful and gracious, along with its just con- 
ception of duty and virtue that, now he admits to himself, 
make her none the less womanly. Indeed, her noble 



 



 





tenderness for Dolly was the first thing that had given 
him the key to her nature ; that delicate way of humoring 
her as one does a captious child, and making her appear 
at her best estate. But the reflected virtues do not de- 
ceive him. Dolly's selfish nature defeats Miss Ormiston's 
good intent, for she pays her friend back in coin of a 
base, counterfeit kind. The ingratitude stings him, since 
it has its root in that utter failure to comprehend anything 
nobler than herself. 

Leighton St. George paces the floor softly. He has 
made that greatest and saddest of mistakes that must 
entail years, perhaps a lifetime, of misery. He has not 
studied his nature and its wants ; his perceptions have 
been confused ; he has not considered the powerful laws 
from which a man's love springs ; he has put something 
baser, lower, and untrue in its place, and now he must 
suffer all the wrongs of an outraged being. He can do 
this in silence, so far as the world is concerned ; but this 
other woman, with the soul shaped to generous uses, must 
come to know that it was circumstances and not pure 
election on his part. He recognizes now that a man of 
the world would have been more wary ; indeed, he could 
have seen for another ; he did see in that curious, intan- 
gible way, when Ward Allaire proposed to marry Miss 
Ormiston. Ah, well, he had let other sympathies and 
respects blind him, and after this one confession of weak- 
ness he must be blind again forever. 

Dolly is not down to breakfast the next morning. The 
three sit at the table, St. George opposite Miss Ormiston. 

They discuss the previous evening, the guests at Cliff 
House, and they both agree to admire Mr. Brundage. 
Something in her clear discrimination, in her delicate 
shades of analysis, seems to catch and hold him with a 
subtile fascination. It leaves a sense of elegance and 
perfectness that is most grateful to his distracted mind. 
Her Toioe, too, has those sensitive but not weak intonation
; She can be enthusiastic, but she does not clond the 
fine atmosphere about her by exaggerations ; she is truth 
in its most attractive guise, that is not made a foil for any 
hidden malice or selfishness or ambitions. 

They are lingering over the last sips of coffee when 
Dolly flits in with a gay greeting, looking fresh and girl- 
ish in her white morning-dress that is elaborate enough 
for a party, with its laces and ribbons. She is more than 
pretty, — bewitching, dainty, and just now intensely good- 
humored. 

The question suddenly comes home to him, can he, in 
honor to the woman he is to marry, discuss his mistake 
with another? 

For an instant he is amazed at himself. Surely he has 
forgotten his  fine code. No; he might come and 
confess some bitter sin of his own to her ; but even if he 
ventured upon the other, her strict rectitude would soon 
lead him back. 

"What are your plans for the morning?'' he asks, 
turning to Dolly. 

''Oh!" with a little laugh, '«am / to be considered? 
Then it is not business and business." And she shrugs 
her shoulders with Parisian grace. 

'' Not until eleven, when I have an engagement with 
Donaldson," he answers quietly. 

" Let me see then :' we might drive," with a question- 
ing look at Christmas. 

" You are entirely welcome to the ponies, if that is 
what you mean." And a smile that deepens the flush 
illumines her face, giving her a moment's illusive beauty 
that is like a revelation to St. George. 

"We might have the carriage," begins Dolly. "It 
would be stupid, just us two alone. You see," with a 
rather awkward little laugh, " we are lovers of the present 
period. We do not need to shut out the world in order to 
have the exquisite pleasure of studying each other's per« 



 



 





fections. We knew them all beforehand. Mamma, yon 
know, trained me into an implicit belief, and Leighton 
is the embodiment of knightly chivalry that can see no 
faults, even if I had them. So, if we can aU go, and 
yon have neither books to look over nor orders to give 
nor paper to inspect, — oh, how can yon bother yonr 
brains with snch matters ! " 

"You wonld hardly imagine it," replies Christmas in a 
bright, cordial tone ; " but I can even add to all this the 
delicate task of learning whether the committee of the 
Orphans' Home will have any objection to their name 
being used on the tickets of the Cliff House Dramatic 
Association. That was my errand this morning." 

" Then let Leighton drive us about, and you shall be 
carefully handed out somewhere to undertake this quest. 
While you are talking within doors, we will be saying 
spicy and ill-natured things to each other." 

" But why ill-natured ? " queries Christmas with a pretty 
incredulity. 

"To keep us from growing too sentimental. It is not 
good form." 

" I am at your service" ; and St. George bows gravely. 

There is nothing for her to do but consent, though she 
would rather send the lovers off by themselves. The 
carriage is ordered, and Christmas reappears in a soft 
grayish silk, while Dolly envelops herself in a thin, fleecy 
Parisian wrap that allows the white glimpses here and 
there to form a contrast with the olive in deep russet 
flecks. Her hat is the perfection of coquetry, and the 
peach-bloom on her cheeks a marvel. Indeed, she puzzles 
Christmas, for now she is all archness and vivacity. 

They take the ravine road first, while they are fresh and 
the morning is at its loveliest. For some distance the sun 
scarcely pierces it, but grains like gold quiver here and 
there. All the air is sweet with resinous odors, and every 
few seconds some bird-call or happy warble pierces it.

Overhead the trees nearly shut oat the blue. The spell 
would be exquisite, St. George thinks, with a woman who 
could comprehend it ; but this unceasing volatile chatter 
drives him half distracted. In vain Christmas makes nn- 
perceived efforts, as she thinks, to moderate the senseless 
gayety, since she reads the secret distress in the brows a 
trifle drawn, and the set, resolute eyes, the compressed 
lips, and infrequent replies. Every moment this unwise 
choice becomes more of a mystery to her, and her sym- 
pathy deepens. 

Out through the woods they go, touching at the river- 
side, then a turn is made townward. Christmas stops at 
Mrs. Longford's, who fortunately is in, and does her er- 
rand satisfactorily. 

"Of course," says Dolly triumphantly, as if she had 
been arguing the case, "they could not have made any 
objection. It is not like a church." 

" Still you would have had no right to use their name 
without their consent," remarks St. George in a gently 
corrective tone. 

" Oh," says Dolly, " or do you mean Christmas? As we 
are neither of us going to act — : but oh, I wish I were ! " 
and her tone changes instantaneously. "I suppose the 
play is all cast," regretfully. 

" The asking is a matter of formal politeness," returns 
Christmas quietly. 

" You never played, did you? " asks Dolly, whose vola- 
tile mind has left the question of proprieties far behind. 

Christmas gives a slow negative with her head. 

" It is just delightful. I was in the prethest little vau- 
deville once at Paris, and I have been in no end of acting 
charades. English people have a passion for them, too. 
We had a play Christmas eve, at Lucia's. Her husband's 
uncle was ill, and they were all so dreadfully afraid he 
would die before we could get through. It was just ele- 
gant. Do you remember that cousin Walter Staular, 



 



 





Leighton? He had a part, and I was the heroine, — a 
pretty Irish girl whom another lover tried to carry oflP. 
There was lots of fun in it." 

" If you did not mind," says Christmas, " we might call 
at Cliff House, and then our part of the affair will be done 
with promptness and success." 

" How business-y I " laughs Dolly, with a flavor of irony. 

No one objects, however, and they take the right-hand 
torn in the road. The front of Cliff House is north- 
easterly, and now it is in the shade and presents a most 
picturesque appearance. It really seems to hang in the 
air amid the hills as they wind around. The broad ve- 
randa is full of easy-chairs, with two hammocks enviously 
interspersed, and groups of guests in white and gay cos- 
tumes are rocking and chatting or lounging. Some one 
within is playing on the piano, accompanied by a flute, 
and the delicious sounds down here in the drive seem a 
component part of the summer. 

Mr. St. George springs out and goes in search of Mrs. 
Brundage, who comes down to the carriage under an azure- 
lined parasol, and expresses her heartiest thanks to Miss 
Ormiston. The gentlemen are to have the tickets printed 
immediately, and there are to be no complimentaries in 
this laudable undertaking. " If we are very much ad- 
mired, we may do something for our friends later in the 
season," declares Mrs. Brundage ; " but we shall rate our 
success by the money we make. That is one of the essen- 
tials of business, is it not?" 

If the inquiry is for Miss Ormiston, Mr. St. Greorge 
intercepts it. 

'' So we men generally think," he replies cordially. 

" And now," when Mrs. Brundage has turned and he is 
stiU standing, " if you will not mind driving home ; for I 
am late, I find." And he glances at his watch. 

" We will go down to the factory for the morning's 
mail," answers Christmas gravely; and he springs in 
again. 



 



 



CHAPTEB XVI. 

WOMEN AKD WOMEN. 

A LONG foreign letter from abroad, and a brief note 
from Mrs. Stannard, are Dolly's portion. 

" Helen is coming to Cliff House for a fortnight," she 
announces, " and I am quite certain it will lengthen out 
indefinitely. She brings up her hcnrses, and that will be 
delightful, and she sends regards to you ; what an im- 
pertinence, she hopes St. Greorge is not really living with 
us." 

A faint flush stains Miss Ormiston's fair brow. 

"Of course," she says, "Mr. St. Greorge is better 
versed in the proprieties." 

" I don't see," begins Dolly in a spirit of contrariety, 
" why there should be anything terrible in your guardian 
making you a visit now and then." 

'' He is not my guardian," is the brief answer. 

" Well, he is something. And he does have to come 
on business. I won't have Helen ordering about. It 
is not her lover." 

Chnstmas makes no comment. 

If Dolly has been childishly amiable during the mcnn- 
ing, she rises from her siesta in a most perverse mood. 
For a wonder no one drops in, and the moments begin to 
hang heavily on the poor butterfly's hands, now that she 
feels well enough to enjoy having incense offered at her 
shrine and finds no one to do it. Even Mrs. Byrne has 
gone to spend the day with her sister. Christmas has 
been reading and dreaming strange troubled dreams for 
her that she tries to dismiss, but that recur with painful 



 



 





persistency. How do women spend whole lives dawdling 
over trifles, she wonders, with no strong vital interest, no 
sympathetic purpose or endeavor for their fellow-crea- 
tures! 

" Is Leighton coming up again this evening?'' DoUy in- 
quires with a ya¥m. 

" You should have asked him," replies Christmas point- 
edly. " He is always a welcome guest." 

" But not a very devoted — lover," says Dolly with a 
touch of asperity. " I really do not care when tiiere are 
other people about ; indeed, too much devotion is nauseating 
in the man you are to marry ; but when one is all alone — 
Christmas," irrelevantly, " did you ever have a lover?" 

" No," is the decisive answer, and a flush stains the 
averted face. 

" Of course I know Ward wanted to marry you : ridic- 
ulous, was it not? But I don't see how you can go on 
this way, with no prospect of marrying, and no one mak- 
ing love, even in fun." 

There is no response, so presently Dolly continues : — 

"And I have had such loads of them. Why, I had 
two oflPers before we left Meadowcrof t to spend that win- 
ter in New York, and I don't remember how many there. 
Men who can't marry, poor men I mean, are always pro- 
posing. I suppose they go from one girl to another, and 
like the fun as well as we do." 

" But, Dolly, what can such a regard be worth?" asks 
Christmas rather severely. 

"Well," and the answer is rather warm, "some of 
them do make love deliciously. There is a great deal of 
humbug talked about first love, and I think it rather poor, 
unpractised stuff, quite lacking in flavor and vim and 
daring intensity. A desperate lover is such a source of 
interest." 

"Why did you not choose a desperate one ? " says Miss 
Ormiston in a tone of repressed indignation. 



 



 



 

" Because I didn't want a desperate husband," replies 
Dolly with a sense of amusement. " You are such an 
innocent about men, Christmas. And just then I was in 
awful trouble. There were two desperate ones, one was 
Lord Clenholm's cousin — the Mr. Staniar I spoke of this 
morning. He was very rich by his mother's second mar- 
riage, and she doted on him as he was her only son. How 
it did vex her that an American girl should $o completely 
bewitch him, and I enjoyed it to the full I Lu wanted to 
make it an engagement ; but Staniar was one of those 
small, blond Englishmen that look like boys, and he was 
past thirty. There was another, a handsome guardsman, 
and between the two they drove me nearly distracted. It 
wouldn't have done to go on, and I didn't want to marry 
Staniar, and the other was too poor. Just then St. George 
made his appearance, and in a little while began to think 
of joining this party for some Indian explorations. 
There were two artists and two or three literary men. It 
was such a good chance ! " And Dolly laughs elfishly. 

Christmas looks at her in surprise, indeed there is a 
deeper feeling compounded of indignation and disgust. 

" I suppose I shock your Ormiston prinmess." And a 
mischievous glow shines in the eyes that now have amber 
lights in them. 

" Do you mean it was a good chance for him to go 
away?" she inquires coldly. 

" The chance was for me, innocent. To be engaged 
and have my lover away, left me comparative freedom 
again ; do you not see ? So, I made him propose ; at least, 
I compelled him to say he loved me — he did love me, you 
know, but not in that way. He never knew the differ- 
ence." And Dolly laughs again with a keen sense of 
amusement. 

"Dolly!" and now her anger, for it is that, finds a 
voice ; " how can jou, how can any woman do such a 
thing?" 



 



 





"But I do love him," remonstrates Dolly. "I shall 
never love any one any better. He is patient and restful ; 
he has an interest of his own ; he can spend days and days 
Gvet his pictures, and he liked it because I did not want 
to keep him from going to India. It isn't every girl who 
would give up her lover for a year and a half the very 
week after she was engaged. It was generous," in a tone 
of self -admiration. "And you see mamma and Lu had 
nothing further to say, for he was rich enough, and mam- 
ma always had a hankering fondness for him. If he had 
been ten years older, I do believe she would have married 
him herself. And so I was very sweet, I could afford to 
be that a little while. I had my liberty and he had his, and 
we just wrote letters. I can write delicious letters," she 
says naively. " Since one has to be married and can have 
a choice, the least objectionable is the best, to my fancy. 
I have seen so many of them," with that world-weary air 
as if the admiration of men surfeited her. 

" And you mean to marry with just this neutral sort of 
preference?" Christmas says, amazed. 

" O Chris, if you could look that way you might be 
quite dangerous as a rival ! It would be an excitement ; 
but it would hardly pay, between you and me. And you 
see I trust you — one always could. You care so little 
for admiration, and I thrive on it. Excitements wear me, 
though. I 'm not real strong any more," she says plain- 
tively, " and he will take good care of me. There will 
be no violent alternations ; I could not stand it. And 
though I tease him a little just to keep my hand in, we 
shall make a comfortable couple in the main. I shall 
never take Helen's worry about society and gauge the 
blue blood one has in one's veins. There, my dear, you 
have all of this strange moving history." 

Dolly rises from her chair and crosses to the hammock, 
arranging herself with languid grace and the perfect self- 
possession of egotistical ease. She has settled her life 



 



 



 

and can drink leisurely of her cup in which no bitter will 
be mingled. For a moment Miss Ormiston's strong sense 
of right and womanly honor make a protest against the 
manifest injustice of so coolly taking possession of a 
man's life and making no return. It is not simply be- 
cause it is Leighton St. Greorge ; but any man would have 
her sympathies. Can she meet him and keep this wretched 
knowledge out of her face. 

As for Dolly, she feels the utter hopelessness of rous- 
ing her to any sense of womanly responsibility. She re- 
members when she first went to Meadowcroft that the 
sort of infantine sweetness was eminently attractive, and 
seemed the exponent of the most charming simplicity. 
She understands how alluring it is to people who have 
not learned to look under the surface and discriminate. 
These pretty baby ways and petulances sit admirably 
upon the girl, who is always posing to the best advantage, 
as if the whole of life was a theatrical show. She sur- 
rounds herself with flowers and goes into a sort of rapt 
ecstasy when there is any one to listen ; but she has no 
deep passion for them ; indeed, would be apt to pronounce 
them a litter under some circumstances. It is the same 
with music. The long evenings Christmas spends at the 
piano for her own solace would bore Dolly dreadfully. 
She must have an audience whom she can move and effect, 
or there is no interest in anything. 

Christmas Ormiston thinks she has seen men whose 
greatest desire appears to be that outside, worldly admi- 
ration for their wives. Why did not Dolly select such a 
one, since, it seems, she can bring any man to the point 
of making love to her. Why choose this one, capable of 
appreciating a higher kind of woman and a higher kind of 
happiness? 

Mrs. Byrne comes home and there is tea. There are 
no calls in the evening. Dolly yawns and frets awhile, 
then curls herself on the sofa and goes fast asleep ; Christ- 



 



 





mas takes up a magazine and reads an article aloud to her 
friend, to distract her thoughts from St. George. She 
cannot resolve the endless tangle ; it is their lives they 
have marred, and she tells herself that it really can be 
nothing to her. But is there some kind of occult fate that 
brings people around to you and gives you a work to do 
for them, whether you will or not? 

St. George spends the evening. in the Donaldsons' pretty 
drawing-room. Of all the people he has known, Miss 
Ormiston and Mrs. Donaldson have developed with more 
fineness and simplicity, have added more largely to that 
spiritual and intellectual grace which is not severity or 
self-complacency. Mrs. Donaldson, with returning health, 
has bloomed into a most admirable mother. She has the 
quality that always attracted him so strongly in Mrs. 
Allaire, and she is not silly over her offspring, neither 
does she consider it her duty to martyr herself for their 
advancement. She is to be their companion, not their 
weak slave. 

While the room has not the grandeur nor the antique 
air that so pervades Glen Ormiston, there is an individu- 
ality about it that charms. Fashion has not been the rul- 
ing power in the adornment, and while due attention has 
been paid to conventionals, there is no heaping up of bric- 
a-brac and no slovenly confusion. It is a room in which 
you have a fair chance for enjoyment ; there is a sense of 
beauty and fitness, an air of elegant leisure for the soul, 
not a wearisome distraction for the eyes. 

Mrs. Donaldson will never outgrow that kind of spirit- 
ual delicacy ; indeed, she recognizes it as her chief charm 
and cultivates it with unremarked assiduity. Its restful- 
ness appeals strongly to St. George. She does not aspire 
to the world of fashion ; she has neither the strength nor 
the means to make herself a star in it ; but in her own 
peculiar sphere, she has gathered a circle that carries 
weight even in those other realms. Invitations are sent 



 



 



her whidi the looks over with secret elation and dedineti 
with so nice a care that she knows she is quite sure to be 
asked again, and when she invites a little company no od% 
stays away. In her way she is as dainty and exclusive as 
lirs. Staimard, though with her it is mental gifts and pure 
breeding. 

They have been discussing the slender chance on which 
Ormiston Mills sailed tiirough the straits of adversity. 

" I did think it a foolish whim on Miss Ormiston's part," 
the lady says, with infinite grace, "not to ask help earlier. 
Philip admitted that if they were in circumstances to com- 
pete with other houses, they would not have dropped to so 
low an ebb. No one ever ccm convince me that a woman's 
Judgment is equal to a man's in such cases. He has the 
breadth and experience which she cannot gain in her femi- 
nine round, and if she does attain to it, it is generally at 
the loss of a delicacy that is her greatest charm." 

" But she had not to go out to gain it," he answers ex- 
cusingly. "She had Philip's experience at hand; she 
also had her father's views and plans and experiments." 

" Yes," the wife says, ignoring the latter part of the 
sentence. " Give me credit for generosity in that I did 
not assert my supreme right to my own husband. I did 
remonstrate, no doubt Philip told you" ; and she points 
her inquiry with a lofty yet dazzling smile that seems to 
raise her above petty jealousy. " It was when he had the 
new offer from my cousin of the place in the bank." 

" Ah, I had not heard of that ! " And surprise accents 
St. George's face. 

Philip has entreated her not to mention it ; but it is one 
of the rights she has reserved. In fact, he has dismissed 
it with a man's wider generosity ; but she holds it against 
Miss Ormiston with one of those under-surf ace grudges 
seldom forgiven, since success took from her the right to 
triumph in her own opinion. 

"It was when matters were at their worst. Philip 



 



 





wanted to apply to yon for a temporary loan ; but she 
would not consent. He was worried to death with anxiety, 
and used to pace the floor night after night feeling certain 
bankruptcy stared them in the face. I should have re« 
gretted Miss Ormiston's loss, of course ; but I had to think
