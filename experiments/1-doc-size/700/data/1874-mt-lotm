two things: that he had killed his victim -in every 
quarter of the globe, and that these victims were 
always named Lynch. The destruction of the Lynches 
went serenely on, Saturday after Saturday, until the 
original thirty had multiplied to sixty, — and more to 
be heard from yet; then my curiosity got the better oi 
my timidity, and I asked how it happened that these 
justly punished persons all bore the same name. 

My hero said he had never divulged that dark secret 
to any living being; but felt that he could trust me, 
and therefore he would lay bare before me the story of 
his sad and blighted life. He had loved one “ too fair 
for earth,” and she had reciprocated “with all the 
sweet affection of her pure and noble nature.” But 
he had a rival, a “ base hireling” named Archibald 
Lynch, who said the girl should be his, or he would 
“dye his hands in her heart’s best blood.” The 
carpenter, “ innocent and happy in love’s young 
dream,” gave no weight to the threat, but led his 
“golden-haired darling to the altar,” and there the 
two were made one; there, also, just as the minister’s 
hands were stretched in blessing over their heads, the 
fell deed was done — with a knife — and the bride fell 
a corpse at her husband’s feet. And what did the 
husband do? He plucked forth that knife, and, kneel- 
ing by the body of his lost one, swore to “ consecrate 
his life to the extermination of all the human scum that 
bear the hated name of Lynch.” 

That was it. He had been hunting down the 
Lynches and slaughtering them, from that day to this 
— twenty years. He had always used that same con- 
secrated knife; with it he had murdered his long 
array of Lynches, and with it he had left upon the 
forehead of each victim a peculiar mark — a cross, 
deeply incised. Said he: 

“The cross of the Mysterious Avenger is known in 
Europe, in America, in China, in Siam, in the Tropics, 
in the Polar Seas, in the deserts of Asia, in all the 
earth. Wherever in the uttermost parts of the globe 
a Lynch has penetrated , there has the Mysterious Cross 
been seen, and those who have seen it have shuddered 

and said, ‘It is his mark; he has been here!' You 
have heard of the Mysterious Avenger — look upon 
him, for before you stands no less a person ! But 
beware — breathe not a word to any soul. Be silent, 
and wait. Some morning this town will flock aghast 
to view a gory corpse ; on its brow will be seen the 
awful sign, and men will tremble and whisper, ‘ He 
has been here — it is the Mysterious Avenger’s mark!’ 
You will come here, but I shall have vanished ; you 
will see me no more.” 

This ass had been reading the “ Jibbenainosay,” no 
doubt, and had had his poor romantic head turned by 
it; but as I had not yet seen the book then, I took his 
inventions for truth, and did not suspect that he was a 
plagiarist. 

However, we had a Lynch living in the town ; and 
the more I reflected upon his impending doom, the 
more I could not sleep. It seemed my plain duty to 
save him, and a still plainer and more important duty 
to get some sleep for myself, so at last I ventured to 
go to Mr. Lynch and tell him what was about to hap- 
pen to him — under strict secrecy. I advised him to 
‘‘fly,” and certainly expected him to do it. But he 
laughed at me ; and he did not stop there ; he led me 
down to the carpenter’s shop, gave the carpenter a 
jeering and scornful lecture upon his silly pretensions, 
slapped his face, made him get down on his knees and 
beg — then went off and left me to contemplate the 
cheap and pitiful ruin of what, in my eyes, had so 
lately been a majestic and incomparable hero. The 
carpenter blustered, flourished his knife, and doomed 
this Lynch in his usual volcanic style, the size of his 
fateful words undiminished ; but it was all wasted upon 
me ; he was a hero to me no longer, but only a poor, 
foolish, exposed humbug. I was ashamed of him, and 
ashamed of myself ; I took no further interest in him, 


and never went to his shop any more. He was a 
heavy loss to me, for he was the greatest hero I had 
ever known. The fellow must have had some taicnt : 
for some of his imaginary murders were so vividly 
and dramatically described that I remember all their 
details yet. 

The people of Hannibal are not more changed than 
is the town. It is no longer a village; it is a city, with 
a Mayor, and a council, and water-works, and probably 
a debt. It has fifteen thousand people, is a thriving 
and energetic place, and is paved like the rest of the 
West and South — where a well-paved street and a 
good sidewalk are things so seldom seen that one 
doubts them when he does see them. The customary 
half-dozen railways center in Hannibal now, and there 
is a new depot, which cost a hundred thousand dollars. 
In my time the town had no specialty, and no com- 
mercial grandeur ; the daily packet usually landed a 
passenger and bought a catfish, and took away another 
passenger and a hatful of freight; but now a huge 
commerce in lumber has grown up, and a large mis- 
cellaneous commerce is one of the results. A deal of 
money changes hands there now. 

Bear Creek — so called, perhaps, because it was 
always so particularly bare of bears — is hidden out of 
sight now, under islands and continents of piled lum- 
ber, and nobody but an expert can find it. I used to 
get drowned in it every summer regularly, and be 
drained out, and inflated and set going again by some 
chance enemy; but not enough of it is unoccupied 
now to drown a person in. It was a famous breeder 
of chills and fever in its day. I remember one summer 
when everybody in town had this disease at once. 
Many chimneys were shaken down, and all the houses 
were so racked that the town had to be rebuilt. The 
chasm or gorge between Lover’s Leap and the hill west 

of it is supposed by scientists to have been caused by 
glacial action. This is a mistake. 

There is an interesting cave a mile or two below 
Hannibal, among the bluffs. I would have liked to 
revisit it, but had not time. In my time the person 
who then owned it turned it into a mausoleum for his 
daughter, aged fourteen. The body of this poor child 
was put into a copper cylinder filled with alcohol, and 
this was suspended in one of the dismal avenues of the 
cave. The top of the cylinder was removable; and it 
was said to be a common thing for the baser order of 
tourists to drag the dead face into view and examine it 
and comment upon it. 



CHAPTER LVI. 

A QUESTION OF LAW 

T HE slaughter-house is gone from the mouth of 
Bear Creek and so is the small jail (or “ cala- 
boose ”) which once stood in its neighborhood. A 
citizen asked, “ Do you remember when Jimmy Finn, 
the town drunkard, was burned to death in the cala- 
boose ?” 

Observe, now, how history becomes defiled, through 
lapse of time and the help of the bad memories of 
men. Jimmy Finn was not burned in the calaboose, 
but died a natural death in a tan vat, of a combination 
of delirium tremens and spontaneous combustion. 
When I say natural death, I mean it was a natural death 
for Jimmy Finn to die. The calaboose victim was not 
a citizen; he was a poor stranger, a harmless, whisky- 
sodden tramp. I know more about his case than any- 
body else; I knew too much of it, in that bygone 
day, to relish speaking of it. That tramp was wander- 
ing about the streets one chilly evening, with a pipe in 
his mouth, and begging for a match; he got neither 
matches nor courtesy; on the contrary, a troop of 
bad little boys followed him around and amused them- 
selves with nagging and annoying him. I assisted ; but 
at last, some appeal which the wayfarer made for for- 
bearance, accompanying it with a pathetic reference to 
his forlorn and friendless condition, touched such sense 
of shame and remnant of right -feeling as were left in 
me, and I went away and got him some matches, and 
then hied me home and to bed, heavily weighted as to 
conscience, and unbuoyant in spirit. An hour or two 
afterward the man was arrested and locked up in the 
calaboose by the marshal — large name fora constable, 
but that was his title. At two in the morning, the 
church-bells rang for fire, and everybody turned out, 
of course — I with the rest. The tramp had used his 
matches disastrously ; he had set his straw bed on fire, 
and the oaken sheathing of the room had caught. 
When I reached the ground, two hundred men, 
women, and children stood massed together, transfixed 
with horror, and staring at the grated windows of the 
jail. Behind the iron bars, and tugging frantically at 
them, and screaming for help, stood the tramp; he 
seemed like a black object set against a sun, so white 
and intense was the light at his back. That marshal 
could not be found, and he had the only key. A 
battering-ram was quickly improvised, and the thunder 
of its blows upon the door had so encouraging a sound 
that the spectators broke into wild cheering, and be- 
lieved the merciful battle won. But it was not so. 
The timbers were too strong; they did not yield. It 
was said that the man’s death-grip still held fast to the 
bars after he was dead ; and that in this position the 
fires wrapped him about and consumed him. As to 
this, I do not know. What was seen, after I recog- 
nized the face that was pleading through the bars, was 
seen by others, not by me. 

I saw that face, so situated, every night for a long 
time afterward ; and I believed myself as guilty of the 
man’s death as if I had given him the matches purposely 
that he might burn himself up with them. I 
had not a doubt that I should be hanged if my connection 
with this tragedy were fovmd out. The happenings 
and the impressions of that time are burned into 
my memory, and the study of them entertains me as 
much now as they themselves distressed me then. If 
anybody spoke of that grisly matter, I was all ears in a 
moment, and alert to hear what might be said, for I 
was always dreading and expecting to find out that I 
was suspected; and so fine and so delicate was the 
perception of my guilty conscience that it often de- 
tected suspicion in the most purposeless remarks, and 
in looks, gestures, glances of the eye, which had no 
significance, but which sent me shivering away in a 
panic of fright, just the same. And how sick it made 
me when somebody dropped, howsoever carelessly and 
barren of intent, the remark that “murder will out!” 
For a boy of ten years, I was carrying a pretty weighty 
cargo. 

All this time I was blessedly forgetting one thing — - 
the fact that I was an inveterate talker in my sleep. 
But one night I awoke and found my bed-mate — my 
younger brother — sitting up in bed and contemplating 
me by the light of the moon. I said: 

“ What is the matter?” 

“ You talk so much I can’t sleep.” 

I came to a sitting posture in an instant, with my 
kidneys in my throat and my hair on end. 

“ What did I say? Quick — out with it — what* did 
I say?” 

“ Nothing much.” 

"It’s a lie — you know everything!” 

"Everything about what?” 

“ You know well enough. About that” 

"About what ? I don’t know what you are talking 
about. I think you are sick or crazy or something. 
But anyway, you’re awake, and I’ll get to sleep while 
I’ve got a chance.” 

He fell asleep and I lay there in a cold sweat, turning 
this new terror over in the whirling. chaos which 
did duty as my mind. The burden of my thought 
was, How much did I divulge? How much does he 
know? What a distress is this uncertainty! But by 
and by I evolved an idea — I would wake my brother 
and probe him with a supposititious case. I shook 
him up, and said: 

"Suppose a man should come to you drunk ” 

“This is foolish — I never get drunk.” 

"I don’t mean you, idiot — I mean the man. Sup- 
pose a man should come to you drunk, and borrow a 
knife, or a tomahawk, or a pistol, and you forgot to 
tell him it was loaded, and ” 

"How could you load a tomahawk?” 

"I don’t mean the tomahawk, and I didn’t say the 
tomahawk; I said the pistol. Now, don’t you keep 
breaking in that way, because this is serious. There’s 
been a man killed.” 

" What ! In this town ?” 

"Yes, in this town.” 

"Well, go on — I won’t say a single word.” 

"Well, then, suppose you forgot to tell him to be 
careful with it, because it was loaded, and he went off 
and shot himself with that pistol — fooling with it, you 
know, and probably doing it by accident, being drunk. 
Well, would it be murder?” 

"No — suicide.” 

"No, no! I don’t mean his act, I mean yours. 
Would you be a murderer for letting him have that 
pistol?” 

After deep thought came this answer: 

"Well, I should think I was guilty of something — 
maybe murder — yes, probably murder, but I don’t 
quite know.” 

This made me very uncomfortable. However, it 
was not a decisive verdict. I should have to set out 


the real case — there seemed to be no other way. But 
I would do it cautiously, and keep a watch out for 
suspicious effects. I said : 

“I was supposing a case, but I am coming to the 
real one now. Do you know how the man came to be 
burned up in the calaboose?” 

“ N °,” 

“ Haven't you the least idea?” 

'' Not the least.” 

'' Wish you may die in your tracks if you have?” 

“ Yes, wish I may die in my tracks.” 

“Well, the way of it was this. The man wanted 
some matches to light his pipe. A boy got him some. 
The man set fire to the calaboose with those very 
matches, and burnt himself up.” 

“ Is that so?” 

“Yes, it is. Now, is that boy a murderer, do you 
think?” 

“ Let me see. The man was drunk?” 

“ Yes, he was drunk.” 

“Very drunk?” 

“Yes.” 

“ And the boy knew it?” 

“ Yes, he knew it.” 

There was a long pause. Then came this heavy verdict : 

“ If the man was drunk, and the boy knew it, the 
boy murdered that man. This is certain.” 

Faint, sickening sensations crept along all the fibers 
of my body, and I seemed to know how a person feels 
who hears his death sentence pronounced from the 
bench. I waited to hear what my brother would say 
next. I believed I knew what it would be, and I was 
right. He said : 

"I know the boy.” 

I had nothing to say ; so I said nothing. I simply 
shuddered. Then he added; 


'' Yes, before you got half through telling about the 
thing, I knew perfectly well who the boy was ; it was 
BenCoontz!” 

I came out of my collapse as one who rises from the 
dead. I said, with admiration : 

“Why, how in the world did you ever guess it?” 

“ You told me in your sleep.” 

I said to myself, “ How splendid that is! This is a 
habit which must be cultivated.” 

My brother rattled innocently on : 

“When you were talking in your sleep, you kept 
mumbling something about 4 matches,’ which I couldn’t 
make anything out of ; but just now, when you began 
to tell me about the man and the calaboose and the 
matches, I remembered that in your sleep you men- 
tioned Ben Coontz two or three times ; so I put this 
and that together, you see, and right away I knew it 
was Ben that burnt that man up.” 

I praised his sagacity effusively. Presently he asked : 

“ Are you going to give him up to the law?” 

“No,” I said, “I believe that this will be a lesson 
to him. I shall keep an eye on him, of course, for 
that is but right; but if he stops where he is and re- 
forms, it shall never be said that I betrayed him.” 

” How good you are !” 

” Well, I try to be. It is all a person can do in a 
world like this.” 

And now, my burden being shifted to other shoul- 
ders, my terrors soon faded away. 

The day before we left Hannibal, a curious thing 
fell under my notice — the surprising spread which 
longitudinal time undergoes there. I learned it from 
one of the most unostentatious of men — the colored 
coachman of a friend of mine, who lives three miles 
from town. He was to call for me at the Park Hotel 
at 7.30 P. M., and drive me out. But he missed it 


considerably — did not arrive till ten. He excused 
himself by saying: 

“ De time is mos’ an* hour en a half slower in de 
country en what it is in de town ; you’ll be in plenty 
time, boss. Sometimes we shoves out early for 
church, Sunday, en fetches up dah right plum in de 
middle er de sermon. Diffunce in de time. A body 
can’t make no calculations ’bout it.” 

I had lost two hours and a half ; but I had learned a 
fact worth four. 



CHAPTER LVIL 

AN ARCHANGEL 

F ROM St. Louis northward there are all the enliven- 
ing signs'of the‘ presence of active, energetic, intel- 
ligent, prosperous, practical nineteenth-century popu- 
lations. The people don't dream; they work. The 
happy result is manifest all around in the substantial 
outside aspect of things, and the suggestions of whole- 
some life and comfort that everywhere appear. 

Quincy is a notable example — a brisk, handsome, 
well-ordered city ; and now, as formerly, interested in 
art, letters, and other high things. 

But Marion City is an exception. Marion City has 
gone backward in a most unaccountable way. This 
metropolis promised so well that the projectors tacked 
“city” to its name in the very beginning, with full 
confidence; but it was bad prophecy. When I first 
saw Marion City, thirty- five years ago, it contained one 
street, and nearly or quite six houses. It contains but 
one house now, and this one, in a state of ruin, is 
getting ready to follow the former five into the river. 

Doubtless Marion City was too near to Quincy. It 
had another disadvantage : it was situated in a flat mud 
bottom, below high-water mark, whereas Quincy stands 
high up on the slope of a hill. 

In the beginning Quincy had the aspect and ways of 
a model New England town: and these she has yet; 

broad, clean streets, trim, neat dwellings and lawns, 
fine mansions, stately blocks of commercial buildings. 
A.nd there are ample fair-grounds, a well-kept park, 
and many attractive drives; library, reading-rooms, a 
couple of colleges, some handsome and costly churches, 
and a grand courthouse, with grounds which occupy a 
square. The population of the city is thirty thousand. 
There are some large factories here, and manufactur- 
ing, of many sorts, is done on a great scale. 

La Grange and Canton are growing towns, but I 
missed Alexandria; was told it was under water, but 
would come up to blow in the summer. 

Keokuk was easily recognizable. I lived there in 
1857, — an extraordinary year there in real-estate mat- 
ters. The “ boom ’ * was something wonderful. Every- 
body bought, everybody sold — except widows and 
preachers; they always hold on; and when the tide 
ebbs, they get left. Anything in the semblance of a 
town lot, no matter how situated, was salable, and at a 
figure which would still have been high if the ground 
had been sodded with greenbacks. 

The town has a population of fifteen thousand now, 
and is progressing with a healthy growth. It was 
night, and we could not see details, for which we were 
sorry, for Keokuk has the reputation of being a beau- 
tiful city. It was a pleasant one to live in long ago, 
and doubtless has advanced, not retrograded, in that 
respect. 

A mighty work, which was in progress there in my 
day, is finished now. This is the canal over the 
Rapids. It is eight miles long, three hundred feet 
wide, and is in no place less than six feet deep. Its 
masonry is of the majestic kind which the War Depart- 
ment usually deals in, and will endure like a Roman 
aqueduct. The work cost four or five millions. 

After an hour or two spent with former friends, we 


started up the river again. Keokuk, a long time ago, 
was an occasional loafing-place of that erratic genius, 
Henry Clay Dean. I believe I never saw him but 
once ; but he was much talked of when I lived there. 
This is what was said of him : 

He began life poor and without education. But he 
educated himself — on the curbstones of Keokuk. He 
would sit down on a curbstone with his book, care- 
less or unconscious of the clatter of commerce and 
the tramp of the passing crowds, and bury himself in 
his studies by the hour, never changing his position 
except to draw in his knees now and then to let a dray 
pass unobstructed; and when his book was finished, 
its contents, however abstruse, had been burned into 
his memory, and were his permanent possession. In 
this way he acquired a vast hoard of all sorts of learn- 
ing, and had it pigeon-holed in his head where he 
could put his intellectual hand on it whenever it was 
wanted. 

His clothes differed in no respect from a “ wharf- 
rat’s,” except that they were raggeder, more ill- 
assorted and inharmonious (and therefore more ex- 
travagantly picturesque), and several layers dirtier. 
Nobody could infer the master-mind in the top of 
that edifice from the edifice itself. 

He was an orator — by nature in the first place, and 
later by the training of experience and practice. 
When he was out on a canvass, his name was a load- 
stone which drew the farmers to his stump from fifty 
miles around. His theme was always politics. He 
used no notes, for a volcano does not need notes. In 
1862 a son of Keokuk’s late distinguished citizen, Mr. 
Claggett, gave me this incident concerning Dean : 

The war feeling was running high in Keokuk (in 
’61), and a great mass meeting was to be held on a 
certain day in the new Athenaeum. A distinguished 




stranger was to address the house. After the building 
had been packed to its utmost capacity with sweltering 
folk of both sexes, the stage still remained vacant — - 
the distinguished stranger had failed to connect. The 
crowd grew impatient, and by and by indignant and 
rebellious. About this time a distressed manager dis- 
covered Dean on a curbstone, explained the dilemma 
to him, took his book away from him, rushed him into 
the building the back way, and told him to make for 
the stage and save his country. 

Presently a sudden silence fell upon the grumbling 
audience, and everybody’s eyes sought a single point — 
the wide, empty, carpetless stage. A figure appeared 
there whose aspect was familiar to hardly a dozen 
persons present. It was the scarecrow Dean — in foxy 
shoes, down at the heels ; socks of odd colors, also 
“ down ” ; damaged trousers, relics of antiquity and a 
world too short, exposing some inches of naked ankle ; 
an unbuttoned vest, also too short, and exposing a 
zone of soiled and wrinkled linen between it and the 
waistband; shirt bosom open; long black handker- 
chief, wound round and round the neck like a bandage; 
bobtailed blue coat, reaching down to the small of the 
back, with sleeves which left four inches of forearm 
unprotected; small, stiff-brimmed soldier-cap hung on 
a corner of the bump of — whichever bump it was. 
This figure rrioved gravely out upon the stage and, with 
sedate and measured step, down to the front, where it 
paused, and dreamily inspected the house, saying no 
word. The silence of surprise held its own for a 
moment, then was broken by a just*audible ripple of 
merriment which swept the sea of faces like the wash 
of a wave. The figure remained as before, thought- 
fully inspecting. Another wave started — laughter, 
this time. It was followed by another, then a third — 
this last one boisterous. 


And now the stranger stepped back one pace, took 
off his soldier-cap, tossed it into the wing, and began 
to speak with deliberation, nobody listening, everybody 
laughing and whispering. The speaker talked on un- 
embarrassed, and presently delivered a shot which went 
home, and silence and attention resulted. He followed 
it quick and fast with other telling things ; warmed to 
his work and began to pour his words out, instead of 
dripping them;, grew hotter and hotter, and fell to 
discharging lightnings and thunder — and now the 
house began to break into applause, to which the 
speaker gave no heed, but went hammering straight 
on ; unwound his black bandage and cast it away, still 
thundering; presently discarded the bobtailed coat and 
flung it aside, firing up higher and higher all the time ; 
finally flung the vest after the coat ; and then for an 
untimed period stood there, like another Vesuvius, 
spouting smoke and flame, lava and ashes, raining 
pumice-stone and cinders, shaking the moral earth 
with intellectual crash upon crash, explosion upon ex- 
plosion, while the mad multitude stood upon their feet 
in a solid body, answering back with a ceaseless hurri- 
cane of cheers, through a thrashing snow-storm of 
waving handkerchiefs. 

“When Dean came" said Claggett, “the people 
thought he was an escaped lunatic ; but when he went, 
they thought he was an escaped archangel . 99 

Burlington, home of the sparkling Burdette, is 
another hill city; and also a beautiful one — unques- 
tionably so ; a fine and flourishing city, with a popula- 
tion of twenty-five thousand, and belted with busy 
factories of nearly every imaginable description. It 
was a very sober city, too — for the moment — fora 
most sobering bill was pending; a bill to forbid the 
manufacture, exportation, importation, purchase, sale, 
borrowing, lending, stealing, drinking, smelling, or 

possession, by conquest, inheritance, intent, accident, 
or otherwise, in the State of Iowa, of each and every 
deleterious beverage known to the human race, except 
water. This measure was approved by all the rational 
people in the State; but not by the bench of judges. 

Burlington has the progressive modern city’s full 
equipment of devices for right and intelligent govern- 
ment, including a paid fire department; a thing 
which the great city of New Orleans is without, but 
still employs that relic of antiquity, the independent 
system. 

In Burlington, as in all these Upper-River towns, 
one breathes a go-ahead atmosphere which tastes good 
in the nostrils. An opera-house has lately been built 
there which is in strong contrast with the shabby dens 
which usually do duty as theaters in cities of Burling- 
ton’s size. 

We had not time to go ashore in Muscatine, but had 
a daylight view of it from the boat. I lived there a 
while, many years ago, but the place, now, had a 
rather unfamiliar look ; so I suppose it has clear out- 
grown the town which I used to know. In fact, I 
know it has; for I remember it as a small place — 
which it isn’t now. But I remember it best for a 
lunatic who caught me out in the fields, one Sunday, 
and extracted a butcher -knife from his boot and pro- 
posed to carve me up with it, unless I acknowledged 
him to be the only son of the Devil. I tried to com- 
promise on an acknowledgment that he was the only 
member of the family I had met ; but that did not 
satisfy him; he wouldn’t have any half-measures ; I 
must say he was the sole and only son of the Devil — 
and he whetted his knife on his boot. It did not seem 
worth while to make trouble about a little thing like 
that ; so I swung round to his view of the matter and 
saved my skin whole. Shortly afterward, he went to 


visit his father ; and as he has not turned up since, I 
trust he is there yet. 

And I remember Muscatine — still more pleasantly 
— for its summer sunsets. I have never seen any, on 
either side of the ocean, that equaled them. They 
used the broad, smooth river as a canvas, and painted 
on it every imaginable dream of color, from the mot- 
tled daintinesses and delicacies of the opal, all the way 
up, through cumulative intensities, to blinding purple 
and crimson conflagrations, which were enchanting to 
the eye, but sharply tried it at the same time. All the 
Upper Mississippi region has these extraordinary sun- 
sets as a familiar spectacle. It is the true Sunset Land : 
I am sure no other country can show so good a right to 
the name. The sunrises are also said to be exceed- 
ingly fine. I do not know. 



CHAPTER LVIII. 


ON THE UPPER RIVER 

T HE big towns drop in, thick and fast, now: and 
between stretch processions of thrifty farms, not 
desolate solitude. Hour by hour, the boat plows 
deeper and deeper into the great and populous North-
