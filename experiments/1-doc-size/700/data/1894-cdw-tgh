py, and to make her happy seemed now very much 
like a worthy object in life. She was so magnani- 
mous, so unsuspicious, so full of all nobility. He 
knew she would stand by him whatever happened. 
Down here her attitude to life was no longer a 



rebuke to him nor a restraint upon him. Every- 
thing seemed natural and wholesome. Perhaps his 
vanity was touched, for there must be something in 
him if such a woman could love him. And prob- 
ably there was, though he himself had never yet 
had a chance to find it out. Brought up in the ex- 
pectation of a fortune, bred to idleness as others 
are to industry, his highest ambition having been 
to amuse himself creditably and to take life easily, 
what was to hinder his being one of the multitude 
of "good-for-nothings" in our modern life? If 
there had been war, he had spirit enough to carry 
him into it, and it would have surprised no one to 
hear that Jack had joined an exploring expedition 
to the North Pole or the highlands of Central Asia. 
Something uncommon he might do if opportunity 
offered. 

About his operations with Henderson he had 
never told Edith, and he did not tell her now. 
Perhaps she divined it, and he rather wondered 
that she had never asked him about his increased 
expenditures, his yacht, and all that. He used to 
look at her steadily at times, as if he were trying 
to read the secrets of her heart. 

" "What are you looking at, Jack ?" 

"To see if I can find out how much you know, 
you look so wise." 

" Do I ? I was just thinking about you. I sup- 
pose that made me look so." 







" No ; about life and the world generally." 
" Mighty little, Jack, except well, I study you." 
" Do you ? Then you'll presently lose your 
mind." 

Jack and most men have little idea that they are 
windows through which their wives see the world ; 
and how much more of the world they know in 
that way than men usually suspect or wives ever 
teU! 

He did not tell her about Henderson, but he al- 
most resolved that when his present venture was 
over he would let stocks alone as speculations, and 
go into something that he could talk about to his 
wife as he talked about stocks to Carmen. 

From the stranded mariners at Bar Harbor Cap- 
tain Jack had many and facetious letters. They 
wanted to know if his idea was that they should 
stick by the yacht until he got leisure to resume 
the voyage, or if he expected them to walk home. 
He had already given orders to the skipper to 
patch it up and bring it to New York if possible, 
and he advised his correspondents to stay by the 
yacht as long as there was anything in the larder, 
but if they were impatient, he offered them trans- 
portation on any vessel that would take able- 
bodied seamen. He must be excused from com- 
manding, because he had been assigned to shore 
duty. Carmen and Miss Tavish wrote that it was 
unfair to leave them to sustain all the popularity 





and notoriety of the shipwreck, and that he owed 
it to the public to publish a statement, in reply to 
the insinuations of the newspapers, in regard to the 
sea-worthiness of the yacht and the object of this 
voyage. Jack replied that the only object of the 
voyage was to relieve the tedium of Bar Harbor, 
and, having accomplished this, he would present the 
vessel to Miss Tavish if she would navigate it back 
to the city. 

The golden autumn days by the sea were little 
disturbed by these echoes of another life, which 
seemed at the moment to be a very shallow one. 
Yet the time was not without its undertone of anxie- 
ties, of grave perils that seemed to sanctify it and 
heighten its pleasures of hope. Jack saw and com- 
prehended for the first time in his life the real 
nature of a pure woman, the depths of tenderness 
and self-abnegation, the heroism and calm trust 
and the nobility of an unworldly life. No wonder 
that he stood a little in awe of it, and days when 
he wandered down on the beach, with only the 
waves for company, or sat smoking in the arbor, 
with an unread book in his hand, his own career 
seemed petty and empty. Such moods, however, 
are not uncommon in any life, and are not of 
necessity fruitful. It need not be supposed that 
Jack took it too seriously, on the one hand, or, on 
the other, that a vision of such a woman's soul is 
ever without influence. 





By the end of October they returned to town, 
Jack, and Edith with a new and delicate attractive- 
ness, and young Fletcher Delancy the most won- 
derful and important personage probably who came 
to town that season. It seemed to Edith that his 
advent would be universally remarked, and Jack 
felt relieved when the boy was safely housed out 
of the public gaze. Yes, to Edith's inexpressible 
joy it was a boy, and while Jack gallantly said 
that a girl would have suited him just as well, he 
was conscious of an increased pride when he an- 
nounced the sex to his friends. This undervalua- 
tion of women at the start is one of the mysteries 
of life. And until women themselves change their 
point of view, it is to be feared that legislation will 
not accomplish all that many of them wish. 

" So it is a boy. I congratulate you," was the 
exclamation of Major Fairfax the first time Jack 
went down to the Union. 

" I'm glad, Major, to have your approval." 

" Oh, it's what is expected, that's all. For my 
part, I prefer girls. The announcement of boys is 
more expensive." 

Jack understood, and it turned out in all the 
clubs that he had hit upon the most expensive sex 
in the view of responding to congratulations. 

" It used to seem to me," said the Major, " that I 
must have a male heir to my estates. But, some- 
how, as the years go on, I feel more like being an 





heir myself. If I had married and had a boy, he 
would have crowded me out by this time ; whereas, 
if it had been a girl, I should no doubt have been 
staying at her place in Lenox this summer instead 
of being shipwrecked on that desert island. There 
is nothing, my dear boy, like a girl well invested." 

" You speak with the feelings of a father." 

"I speak, sir, from observation. I look at so- 
ciety as it is, not as it would be if we had primo- 
geniture and a landed aristocracy. A daughter 
under our arrangements is more likely to be a com- 
fort to her parent in his declining years than a 
son." 

" But you seem, Major, to have preferred a single 
life?" 

" Circumstances thank you, just a drop more 
we are the creatures of circumstances. It is a long 
story. There were misrepresentation and misun- 
derstanding. It is true, sir, that at that tune my 
property was encumbered, but it was not unpro- 
ductive. She died long ago. I have reason to 
believe that her married life was not happy. I 
was hot-blooded in those days, and my honor was 
touched, but I never blamed her. She was, at 
twenty, the most beautiful woman in Virginia. I 
have never seen her equal." 

This was more than the Major had ever revealed 
about his private life before. He had created an 
illusion about himself which society accepted, and 



in which he lived in apparent enjoyment of metro- 
politan existence. This was due to a sanguine 
temperament and a large imagination. And he 
had one quality that made him a favorite a hearty 
enjoyment of the prosperity of others. With re- 
gard to himself, his imagination was creative, and 
Jack could not now tell whether this " most beau- 
tiful woman of Virginia" was not evoked by the 
third glass, about which the Major remarked, as he 
emptied it, that only this extraordinary occasion 
could justify such an indulgence at this time of 
day. 

The courtly old gentleman had inquired about 
madam indeed, the second glass had been dedi- 
cated to "mother and child" and he exhibited a 
friendly and almost paternal interest, as he always 
did, in Jack. 

" By-the-way," he said, after a silence, " is Hen- 
derson in town ?" 

" I haven't heard. Why ?" 

" There's been a good deal of uneasiness in the 
Street as to what he is doing. I hope you haven't 
got anything depending on him." 

" I've got something in his stocks, if that is what 
you mean ; but I don't mind telling you I have 
made something." 

" Well, it's none of my business, only the Hen- 
derson stocks have gone off a little, as you know." 

Jack knew, and he asked the Major a little ner- 







vonsly if he knew anything further. The Major 
knew nothing except Street rumors. Jack was 
uneasy, for the Major was a sort of weather - cock, 
and before he left the club he wrote to Mavick. 

He carried home with him a certain disquiet, to 
which he had been for months a stranger. Even 
the sight of Edith, who met him with a happy 
face, and dragged him away at once to see how 
lovely the baby looked asleep, could not remove 
this. It seemed strange that such a little thing 
should make a change, introduce an alien element 
into this domestic peace. Jack was like some 
other men who lose heart not when they are doing 
a doubtful thing, but when they have to face the 
consequences cases of misplaced conscience. The 
peace and content that he had left in the house in 
the morning seemed to have gone out of it when 
he returned at night. 

Next day came a reassuring letter from Mavick. 
Henderson was going on as usual. It was only a 
little bear movement, which wouldn't amount to 
anything. Still, day after day, the bears kept 
clawing down, and Jack watched the stock-list 
with increasing eagerness. He couldn't decide to 
sacrifice anything as long as he had a margin of 
profit. 

In this state of mind it was impossible to con- 
sider any of the plans he had talked over with 
Edith before the baby was born. Inquiries he did 





make about some sort of position or regular occu- 
pation, and these he reported to Edith; but his 
heart was not in it. 

As the days went by there was a little improve- 
ment in his stocks, and his spirits rose. But this 
mood was no more favorable than the other for 
beginning a new life, nor did there seem to be, as 
he went along, any need of it. He had an appear- 
ance of being busy every day ; he rose late and 
went late to bed. It was the old life. Stocks 
down, there was a necessity of bracing up with 
whomever he met at any of the three or four clubs 
in which he lounged in the afternoon ; and stocks 
up, there was reason for celebrating that fact in 
the same way. 

It was odd how soon he became accustomed to 
consider himself and to be regarded as the father 
of a family. That, also, like his marriage, seemed 
something done, and in a manner behind him. 
There was a commonplaceness about the situation. 
To Edith it was a great event. To Jack it was a 
mile-stone in life. He was proud of the boy ; he 
was proud of Edith. " I tell you, fellows," he 
would say at the club, " it's a great thing," and so 
on, in a burst of confidence, and he was quite sin- 
cere in this. But he preferred to be at the club 
and say these things rather than pass the same 
hours with his adorable family. He liked to think 
what he would do for that family what luxuries 



he could procure for them, how they should travel 
and see the world. There wasn't a better father 
anywhere than Jack at this period. And why 
shouldn't a man of family amuse himself? Be- 
cause he was happy in his family he needn't change 
all the habits of his life. 

Presently he intended to look about him for 
something to do that would satisfy Edith and fill 
up his time ; but meantime he drifted on, alter- 
nately anxious and elated, until the season opened. 
The Blunts and the Yan Dams and the Chesneys 
and the Tavishes and Mrs. Henderson had called, 
invitations had poured in, subscriptions were asked, 
studies and gayeties were projected, and the real 
business of life was under way. 



CHAPTER XV 

To the nurse of the Delancy boy and to his 
mother he was by no means an old story or merely 
an incident of the year. He was an increasing 
wonder new every morning, and exciting every 
evening. He was the centre of a world of solic- 
itude and adoration. It would be scarcely too 
much to say that his coining into the world prom- 
ised a new era, and his traits, his likes and dislikes, 
set a new standard in his court. If he had appre- 
hended his position his vanity would have out- 
grown his curiosity about the world, but he dis- 
played no more consciousness of his royalty than 
a kicking Infanta of Spain. This was greatly to 
his credit in the opinion of the nurse, who devoted 
herself to the baby with that enthusiasm of women 
for infants which fortunately never fails, and won 
the heart of Edith by her worship. And how 
much they found to say about this marvel ! To 
hear from the nurse, over and over again, what 
the baby had done and had not done, in a given 
hour, was to Edith like a fresh chapter out of an 
exciting romance. 

And the boy's biographer is inclined to think 





that he had rare powers of discrimination, for one 
day when Carmen had called and begged to be per- 
mitted to go up into the nursery, and had asked to 
take him in her arms just for a moment, notwith- 
standing her soft dress and her caressing manner, 
Fletcher had made a wry face and set up a howl. 
" How much he looks like his father " (he didn't 
look like anything), Carmen said, handing him over 
to the nurse. What she thought was that in man- 
ner and disposition he was totally unlike Jack 
Delancy. 

When they came down-stairs, Mrs. Schuyler 
Blunt was in the drawing-room. 

" I've had such a privilege, Mrs. Blunt, seeing 
the baby !" cried Carmen, in her sweetest manner. 

" It must have been," that lady rejoined, stiffly. 

Carmen, who hated to be seen through, of all 
things, did not know whether to resent this or not. 
But Edith hastened to the rescue of her guest. 

" I think it's a privilege." 

" And you know, Mrs. Blunt," said Carmen, re- 
covering herself and smiling, " that I must have 
some excitement this dull season." 

" I see," said Mrs. Blunt, with no relaxation of 
her manner ; " we are all grateful to Mrs. De- 
lancy." 

" Mrs. Henderson does herself injustice," Edith 
again interposed. " I can assure you she has a 
great talent for domesticity." 





Carmen did not much fancy this apology for her, 
but she rejoined : " Yes, indeed. I'm going to cul- 
tivate it." 

" How is this privileged person ?" Mrs. Blunt 
asked. 

" You shall see," said Edith. " I am glad you 
came, for I wanted very much to consult you. I 
was going to send for you." 

" "Well, here I am. But I didn't come about the 
baby. I wanted to consult you. We miss you, 
dear, every day." And then Mrs. Blunt began to 
speak about some social and charitable arrange- 
ments, but stopped suddenly. " I'll see the baby 
first. Good-morning, Mrs. Henderson." And she 
left the room. 

Carmen felt as much left out socially as about 
the baby, and she also rose to go. 

" Don't go," said Edith. " What kind of a sum- 
mer have you had ?" 

" Oh, very good. Some shipwrecks." 

" And Mr. Henderson ? Is he weU ?" 

" Perfectly. He is away now. Husbands, you 
know, haven't so much talent for domesticity as 
we have." 

" That depends," Edith replied, simply, but with 
that spirit and air of breeding before which Car- 
men always inwardly felt defeat " that depends 
very much upon ourselves." 

Naturally, with this absorption in the baby, 





Edith was slow to resume her old interests. Of 
course she knew of the illness of Father Damon, 
and the nurse, who was from the training-school 
in which Dr. Leigh was an instructor, and had 
been selected for this important distinction by the 
doctor, told her from time to time of affairs on 
the East Side. Over there the season had opened 
quite as usual ; indeed, it was always open ; worl* 
must go on every day, because every day food 
must be obtained and rent-money earned, and the 
change from summer to winter was only a climatio 
increase of hardships. Even an epidemic scare 
does not essentially vary the daily monotony, which 
is accepted with a dogged fatality. 

There had been no vacation for Euth Leigh, and 
she jokingly said, when at length she got a half- 
hour for a visit to Edith, that she would hardly 
know what to do with one if she had it. 

" We have got through very well," she added. 
"We always dread the summer, and we always 
dread the winter. Science has not yet decided 
which is the more fatal, decayed vegetables or un- 
ventilated rooms. City residence gives both a fair 
chance at the poor." 

" Are not the people learning anything ?" Edith 
asked. 

" Not much, except to bear it, I am sorry to say. 
Even Father Damon " 

" Is he at work again ? Do you see him often ?" 







" Yes, occasionally," 

" I should so like to see him. But I interrupted 
you." 

" Well, Father Damon has come to see that noth- 
ing can be done without organization. The masses" 
and there was an accent of bitterness in her use 
of the phrase " must organize and fight for any- 
thing they want." 

" Does Father Damon join in this ?" 

" Oh, he has always been a member of the Labor 
League. Now he has been at work with the Epis- 
copal churches of the city, and got them to agree, 
when they want workmen for any purpose, to em- 
ploy only union men." 

" Isn't that," Edith exclaimed, " a surrender of 
individual rights and a great injustice to men not 
in the unions ?" 

" You would see it differently if you were in the 
struggle. If the working-men do not stand by 
each other, where are they to look for help? 
What have the Christians of this city done ?" and 
the little doctor got up and began to pace the 
room. " Charities ? Yes, little condescending char- 
ities. And look at the East Side ! Is its condition 
any better I tell you, Mrs. Delancy, I don't be- 
lieve in charities in any charities." 

" It seems to me," said Edith, with a smile cal- 
culated to mollify this vehemence, "that you are 
a standing refutation of your own theory." 







" Me ? No, indeed. I'm paid by the dispensary. 
And I make my patients pay when they are 
able." 

" So I have heard," Edith retorted. " Your bills 
must be a terror to the neighborhood." 

" You may laugh. But I'm establishing a repu- 
tation over there as a working - woman, and if I 
have any influence, or do any little good, it's owing 
to that fact. Do you think they care anything 
about Father Damon's gospel ?" 

" I should be sorry to think they did not," Edith 
said, gravely. 

" Well, very little they care. They like the man 
because they think he shares their feelings, and 
does not sympathize with them because they are 
different from him. That is the only kind of gos- 
pel that is good for anything over there." 

" I don't think Father Damon would agree with 
you in that." 

" Of course he would not. He's as medieval as 
any monk. But then he is not blind. He sees 
that it is never anything but personal influence 
that counts. Poor fellow," and the doctor's voice 
softened, "he'll kill himself with his ascetic no- 
tions. He is trying to take up the burden of this 
life while struggling under the terror of another." 

" But he must be doing a great deal of good." 

" Oh, I don't know. Nothing seems to do much 
good. But his presence is a great comfort. That 







is something. And I'm glad he is going about now 
rousing opposition to what is, rather than all the 
time preaching submission to the lot of this life for 
the sake of a reward somewhere else. That's a 
gospel for the rich." 

Edith was accustomed to hear Kuth Leigh talk in 
this bitter strain when this subject was introduced, 
and she contrived to turn the conversation upon 
what she called practical work, and then to ask 
some particulars of Father Damon's sudden illness. 

" He did rest," the doctor said, " for a little, in 
his way. But he will not spare himself, and he 
cannot stand it. I wish you could induce him to 
come here often to do anything for diversion. He 
looks so worn." 

There was in the appeal to Edith a note of per- 
sonal interest which her quick heart did not fail to 
notice. And the thought came to her with a pain- 
ful apprehension. Poor thing ! Poor Father Da- 
mon ! Does not each of them have to encounter 
misery enough without this? Doesn't life spare 
anybody ? 

She told her apprehension to Jack when he came 
home. 

Jack gave a long whistle. "That is a dead- 
lock !" 

" His vows, and her absolute materialism ! Both 
of them would go to the stake for what they be- 
lieve, or don't believe. It troubles me very much." 



"But," said Jack, "it's interesting. It's what 
they call a situation. There. I didn't mean to 
make light of it. I don't believe there is anything 
in it. But it would be comical, right here in New 
York." 

" It would be tragical." 

" Comedy usually is. I suppose it's the human 
nature in it. That is so difficult to get rid of. But I 
thought the missionary business was safe. Though, 
do you know, Edith, I should think better of both 
of them for having some human feeling. By-the- 
way, did Dr. Leigh say anything about Hender- 
son ?" 

" No. What ?" 

" He has given Father Damon ten thousand dol- 
lars. It's in strict secrecy, but Father Damon said 
I might tell you. He said it was providential." 

" I thought Mr. Henderson was wholly unscru- 
pulous and cold as ice." 

" Yes, he's got a reputation for freeze-outs. If 
the Street knew this it would say it was insurance- 
money. And he is so cynical that he wouldn't 
care what the Street said." 

" Do you think it came about through Mrs. Hen- 
derson?" 

" I don't think so. She was speaking of Father 
Damon this morning in the Loan Exhibition. I 
don't believe she knows anything about it. Hen* 
derson is a good deal shut up in himself. They 





say at the Union that years ago he used to do a 
good many generous things that he is a great 
deal harder than he used to be." 

This talk was before dinner. She did not ask 
anything now about Carmen, though she knew 
that Jack had fallen into his old habit of seeing 
much of her. He was less and less at home, except 
at dinner-time, and he was often restless, and, she 
saw, often annoyed. When he was at home he 
tried to make up for his absence by extra tenderness 
and consideration for Edith and the boy. And 
this effort, and its evidence of a double if not di- 
vided life, wounded her more than the neglect. 
One night, when he came home late, he had been 
so demonstrative about the baby that Edith had 
sent the nurse out of the room until she could coax 
Jack to go into his own apartment. His fits of 
alternate good -humor and depression she tried to 
attribute to his business, to which he occasionally 
alluded without confiding in her. 

The next morning Father Damon came in about 
luncheon-time. He apologized for not coming be- 
fore since her return, but he had been a little upset, 
and his work was more and more interesting. His 
eyes were bright and his manner had quite the 
usual calrn^ but he looked pale and thinner, and so 
exhausted that Edith ran immediately for a glass 
of wine, and began to upbraid him for not taking 
better care of himself. 





" I take too much care of myself. "We all do. 
The only thing I've got to give is myself." 

" But you will not last," 

" That is of little moment ; long or short, a man 
can only give himself. Our Lord was not here 
very long." And then Father Damon smiled, and 
said : " My dear friend, I'm really doing very well. 
Of course I get tired. Then I come up again. And
