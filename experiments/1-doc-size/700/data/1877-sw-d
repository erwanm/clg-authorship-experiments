' There was a reason for that. " As cold waters to a 
thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country." You 
were not thirsty, that is all.' 

' Basil,' said Diana almost tremulously, ' I think I am 
now.' 

' Well,' said her husband tenderly, ' you know who 
could say, and did say, " If any man thirst, let him come 
unto ME and drink." " I am the bread of life ; he that 
cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on 
me shall never thirst." ' 

That bringing together of need and supply, while yet 
Need does not see how it is to stretch out its hand to take 
the supply how sharp and how pitiful it makes the sense 
of longing! Diana drooped her head till it touched 



Basil's arm ; it seemed to her that her heart would fairly 
break. 

' But that doesn't mean ' she said, bringing out her 
words with hesitation and difficulty, 'that does not mean 
hunger of every sort ? ' 

' Yes.' 

' Of earthly sorts, Basil ? how can it ? people's desires 
for so many things ? ' 

' Is there any limit or qualification to the promise ? ' 

' No ; not there.' 

' Is there anywhere else ? ' 

Diana was silent. 

' There is none anywhere, except the limit put by the 
faith of the applicant. I have known a person starving to 
death, relieved for the time even from the pangs of bodily 
hunger by the food which Christ gave her. There is no condition of human extremity, for which he is not sufficient' 

' But,' said Diana, still speaking with difficulty, ' that is 
for some people.' 

' For some people and for everybody else.' 

' But he would not like to have anybody go to him 
just for such a reason.' 

' He will never ask why you came, if you come. He 
was in this world to relieve misery, and to save from it. 
" Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out," is his 
own word. He will help you if you will let him, Diana.' 

Diana's head pressed more heavily against Basil's arm ; 
the temptation was to break out into wild weeping at this 
contact of sympathy, but she would not. Did her husband 
guess how much she was in want of help ? That thought 
half frightened her. Presently she raised her head and sat 
up. 

' Here is another verse,' said her husband, ' which tells 


 

of a part of my work. " Go ye into the highways, and as 
many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage" ' 

' I don't understand ' 

' " The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king 
which made a marriage for his son," it means rather a 
wedding entertainment.' 

' How, Basil ? ' 

' The Bridegroom is Christ. The bride is the whole 
company of his redeemed. The time is by and by, when 
they shall be all gathered together, all washed from defilement, all dressed in the white robes of the king's court 
which are given them, and delivered from the last shadow 
of mortal sorrow and infirmity. Then in glory begins their 
perfected, everlasting union with Christ ; then the wedding 
is celebrated ; and the supper signifies the fulness and 
communion of His joy in them and their joy in Him.' 

Basil's voice was a little subdued as he spoke the last 
words, and he paused a few minutes. 

' It is my business to bid people to that supper,' he said 
then ; ' and I bid you, Di.' 

' I will go, Basil.' 

But the words were low and the tears burst forth, and 
Diana hurried away. 






CHAPTER XXIV. 

THE MINISTER'S WIFE. 

DIANA plunged herself now into business. She was 
quite in earnest in the promise she had made at the end 
of the conversation last recorded ; but to set about a work 
is one thing and to carry it through is another ; and Diana 
did not immediately see light. In the meanwhile, the pressure of the bonds of her new existence was only to be 
borne by forgetting it in intense occupation. Her husband 
wanted her to study many things ; for her own sake and for 
his own sake he wished it, knowing that her education 
had been exceedingly orie-sided and imperfect ; he wanted 
all sources of growth and pleasure to be open to her, and 
he wanted full communion with his wife in his own life 
and life-work. So he took her hands from the frying-pan 
and the preserving kettle, and put dictionaries and philosophies into them. On her part, besides the negative incitement of losing herself and her troubles in books, Di- 
ana's mental nature was too sound and rich- not to take 
kindly the new seeds dropped into the soil. She had gone 
just far enough in her own private reading and thinking to 
be all ready to spring forward in the wider sphere to which 
she was invited, and in which a hand took hers to help her 
along. The consciousness of awakening power, too, and of 
enlarging the bounds of her world, drew her on. Sometimes in Basil's study, where he had arranged a place for her, 



 

sometimes down stairs in her own little parlour, Diana pored 
over books and turned the leaves of dictionaries ; and felt 
her way along the mazes of Latin stateliness, or wondered 
and thrilled at the beauty of the Greek words of the New 
Testament as her husband explained them to her. Or she 
wrought out problems ; or she wrote abstracts ; or she dived 
into depths of philosophical speculation. Then Diana began 
to learn French, and very soon was delighting herself in 
one or other of a fine collection of French classics which 
filled certain shelves in the library. There was, besides all 
the motives above-mentioned which quickened and stimulated her zeal for learning, another very subtle underlying 
cause which had not a little to do with her unflagging energy in pursuit of her objects. Nay, there were two. Diana did earnestly wish to please her husband, and for his sake to become, so far as cultivation would do it, a fit com- 
panion for him. That she knew. But she scarcely knew, 
how beneath all that and mightier than all that, was the 
impulse to make herself worthy of the other man whose 
companion now she would never be. Subtle, as so many 
of our springs of action are, unrecognized, it drove her 
with an incessant impulse. To be such a woman as Evan 
would have been proud of ; such a one as he would have liked 
to stand by his side anywhere ; one that he need not have 
feared to present in any society. Diana strove for it, and 
that although Evan would never know it and it did not in the 
least concern him. And as she felt from time to time that 
she was attaining her end and coming nearer and nearer 
to what she wished to be, Diana was glad with a secret joy 
which was not the love of knowledge, nor the pride of personal ambition, nor the duty of an affectionate wife. As 
I said, she did not recognize it ; if she had, I think she 
would have tried to banish it. 



 

One afternoon she was sitting by her table at the study 
window, where she had been very busy but was not busy 
now. The window was open ; the warm summer air came 
in, and over the hills and the lowland the brilliance and 
glow of the evening sunlight was just at its brightest. Diana 
sat gazing out, while her thoughts went wandering. Suddenly she pulled them up ; and her question was rather a 
departure, though standing in a certain negative connection 
with them. 

' Basil, I can't make out just what faith is.' 

' Cannot you ? ' 

' No. Can you help me ? The Bible says, " believe" 
' believe." I believe. I believe everything it tells me, and 
you tell me ; but I have not faith.' 

' How do you know that ? ' 

' If I had, I should be a Christian.' 

' And you think you are not ? ' 

' I am sure I am not.' 

' Are you willing ? ' 

' I think I am willing,' Diana answered slowly, looking out into the sunlight. 

' If you are right, then faith must be something more 
than mere belief.' 

'What more is it?' she said eagerly, turning her face 
towards him now. 

' I think, the heart has its part in it, as well as the head 
and it is with the heart that the difficulty lies. In true 
Bible faith, the heart gives its confidence where the intellect 
has given its assent. " With the heart man believeth unto 
righteousness." That is what the Lord wants ; our per 
sonal trust in him ; unreserved and limitless trust ' 

' Trust ? ' said Diana. ' Then why cannot I give it ? 
why don't I ? ' 



 

' That is the question to be answered. But Di, the 
heart cannot yield that confident trust, so long as there is 
any point in dispute between it and God ; so long as there 
is any consciousness of holding back something from him 
or refusing something to him. Disobedience and trust 
cannot go together. It is not the child who is standing 
out in rebellion, who can stretch out his hand for his 
father's gifts and know that they will be given.' 

' Do you think I am rebelling, Basil ? ' 

' I cannot see into your heart, Di.' 

' What could I be " holding back " from God ? ' 

' Unconditional surrender.' 

' Surrender of what ? ' 

'Yourself your will. When you have made that 
surrender, there will be no difficulty about trusting. There 
never is.' 

Diana turned to the window again, and leaning her 
head on her hand sat motionless for a long time. Sunlight 
left the bottom lands and crept up the hills and faded out 
of the sky. Dusk and dews of twilight fell all around, and 
the dusk deepened till the stars began to shine out here 
and there. Sweet summer scents came in on the dew- 
freshened air ; sweet chirrup of insects made their gentle 
running commentary on the silence ; Miss Collins had long 
ago caused the little bell with which she was wont to notify 
her employers that their meals were ready, to sound its 
tinkling call to supper ; but Diana had not heard it, and 
the minister would not disturb her. It was after a very 
long time of this silence that she rose, came to the table 
where he was sitting, and knelt down beside it. 

' I believe,' she said. ' And I trust, Basil.' 

He took her hand, but said nothing otherwise. He 
could not see her face, for she had laid it down upon some 



 

books, and besides the room was very dusky now. But 
when he expected some further words which should tell of 
relief, or joy, to his surprise he felt that Diana was weeping, and then that her tears had grown into a storm. Most 
strange for her, who very rarely let him or anyone see the 
outbursts of such feeling ; indeed even by herself she was 
very slow to come to the indulgence of tears. It was not 
her way. Now, before she was aware, they were flowing ; 
and as it is with some natures, if you open the sluice gates 
at all, a flood pours forth which makes it impossible to shut 
them again for a while. And this time I think she forgot 
that anybody was by. He was puzzled. Was it joy or 
sorrow ? Hard for herself to tell, there was so much of both 
in it. For with the very first finding of a sufficient refuge 
and help for her trouble, Diana had brought her burden 
to His feet, and there was weeping convulsively; partly 
from the sense of the burden, partly with the sense of laying it down, and with the might of that infinite sympathy 
the apprehension of which was beginning to dawn upon 
her now for the first time. What is it like ? O what is it 
like ! It is the " Dayspring from on high." Basil could not 
read all she was feeling and spell it out. But I think he 
had a sort of instinct of it, and felt that his wife was very 
far from him, in this her agony of joy and sorrow ; for he 
kept motionless, and his broad brow, which never was 
wrinkled, was very grave. One hand he laid lightly upon 
Diana's shoulder, as if so to remind her of his presence 
and close participation in all that concerned her ; otherwise 
he did not interrupt her nor make any claim upon her 
attention. 

Gradually Diana's sobs ceased ; and then she grew 
utterly still ; and the two sat so together, for neither of 
them knew how long. At last Diana raised her head. 



 

' You have had no supper all this while ! ' she said. 

' I have had something much better,' said he, gently 
kissing her cheek. 

' To see me cry ? ' said Diana. ' I don't know why I 
cried.' 

' I think I do. Don't you feel better for it ? 

' Yes. Or else, for that which made me do so. Come 
down, Basil.' 

At tea she was perfectly herself and quite as usual, 
except for the different expression in her face. It was 
hardly less grave than before, but something dark had gone 
out and something light had come in. 

' I can face the Sewing Society now,' she remarked 
towards the end of the meal. 

' The Sewing Society ! ' her husband echoed. ' Is that 
much to face ? ' 

' I have not been once since I was married. And they 
make so much fuss about it, I must go now. They meet 
to-morrow at mother's.' 

' What do they sew ? ' 

' They pretend to be making up a box for some mis- 
sionary out west.' 

' I guess there is no pretence about it.' 

' Yes, there is. They have been eight months at work 
upon a box to go to Iowa somewhere, to a family very much 
in want of everything ; and the children and mother are 
almost, or quite I guess, in rags, and the ladies here are 
comfortably doing a little once a week, and don't even 
expect to have the box made up till Christmas time. Think 
of the people in Iowa waiting and waiting, with hardly 
anything to put on, while we meet once a week and sew a 
little and talk and have supper.' 

' How would you manage it ? ' 



 

' I would send off the box next week, Basil.' 

' So would I. Suppose now we do ? ' 

' Send off a box ? ' 

' Yes. I will give you the money you can go I will 
drive you down to Gunn's, and you can get there whatever you think would be suitable, and we will have the fun 
to ourselves.' 

The colour flushed into Diana's face ; it was the first 
flush of pleasure that had come there in a long while. 

' You are very good, Basil ! ' she said. ' Don't you 
think I could drive Saladin ? ' 

' Where ? ' 

' Anywhere. I mean, that I could go to places then 
without troubling you to drive me.' 

' I can stand so much trouble. It is not good for a man 
to live too easy.' 

' But it might be convenient for you sometimes.' 

' So it might. And pleasant for you. No, I should not 
like to trust you to Saladin. I wonder rf your mother would 
let me have Prince, if I offer her a better horse in exchange. 
Perhaps I can do better than that. We will see.' 

' O Basil, you must not get another horse for me ! ' 

' I will get anything I like for you.' 

' But do you mean, and keep Saladin too ? ' 

' I mean that. Saladin is necessary to me.' 

' Then don't Basil. I can tell you, people will say you are 
extravagant if you have two horses.' 

' I cannot help people talking scandal.' 

' No, but it will hurt your influence.' 

' Well, we will feel the pulse of the public to-morrow. 
But I think they would stand it.' 

They drove down to Mrs. Starling's the next day. Mr. 
Masters had other business and must go further. Diana went 



 

in alone. She was early, for she had come to help her 
mother make the preparations ; and at first these engrossed 
them both. 

' Well,' said Mrs. Starling, when some time had passed, 
'how do you get along with your husband? ' 

Diana's eyes opened slightly. ' It would be a very strange 
person that could not get on with Mr. Masters,' she answered. 

' Easy, is he ? I hate easy men ! The best of 'em are 
helpless enough ; but when you get one of the easy soft, 
they are consented if every door hangs on one hinge.' 

Diana made no answer. 

' How does your girl get along ? 

' Very well. Pretty well.' 

' What you want with a girl, I don't see.' 

' I didn't either. But Mr. Masters wants me to do other 
things.' 

' Set you up to be a lady ! Well, the world's full o' 
fools.' 

' I am as busy, mother, as ever I was in my life.' 

' Depends on what you call business. Making yourself 
unfit for business, I should say. Call it what you like. I 
suppose he is your humble servant, and just gives you your 
own way.' 

' He is not that sort of man at all, mother. He is as 
kind as he can be ; but he is nobody's humble servant.' 

' Then I suppose you are his. There is somebody now, 
Diana ; it's Kate Boddington. Do go i-n and take care of 
her you can do so much, and keep her from coming out 
here where I am.' 

' Well, Di ! ' exclaimed her relative as Diana met her. 
'Ain't it a sight to see. you at the sewin' meetin' ! Why 
haven't you been before ? Seems to me, you make an uncommon long honeymoop of it.' 



Diana's natural sweetness and dignity, and further- 
more, the great ballast of old pain and new gladness which 
lay deep down in her heart, kept her quite steady and unruffled under all such breezes. She had many of the like 
to meet that day ; and the sweet calm and poise of her 
manner through them all would have done honour to the 
most practrsed woman of the world. Most of her friends 
and neighbours here collected had scarce seen her since her 
marriage, unless in church ; and they were curious to 
know how she would carry herself, and curious in general 
about many things. It was a sort of battery that Diana 
had to face, and sometimes a masked battery ; but it was 
impossible to tell whether a shot hit. 

'What I want to know,' said Mrs. Boddington, 'is, 
where the minister and you made it up, Di. You were 
awful sly about it ! ' 

' Ain't that so ? ' chimed in Mrs. Carpenter. ' I never 
had no notion o' what was goin' on ; not the smallest 
idee ; and I was jest a sayin' one day to Miss Gunn, or 
somebody I declare I don't know now who 'twas, I was 
so dumbfounded when the news come, it took all my 
memory away ; but I was jes' a sayin' to somebody, and 
I remember it because I'd jes' been after dandelion greens 
and couldn't find none ; they was jest about past by then, 
and bitter ; and we was a settin' with our empty baskets : 
and I was jes' tellin' somebody, I don't know who 'twas, 
who I thought would make a good wife for the minister ; 
when up comes Mrs. Starling's Josiah and reaches me the 
invitation. " There ! " says I ; "if he ain't a goin' to have 
Diana Starling! " I was beat.' 

' I dare say you could have fitted him just as well,' 
remarked Mrs. Starling. 

' Wall, I don't know. I was thinkin', but I guess 
it's as well not to say now what I was thinkin'.' 



' That so ! ' assented Miss Barry. ' I don't believe he 
thinks nobody could ha' chosen for him no better than he 
has chosen for himself.' 

' Men never do know what is good for them,' Mrs. 
Salter remarked, but not ill-naturedly ; on the contrary, 
there was a gleam of fun in her face. 

' I'm thankful anyway he hain't done worse,' said another lady. ' I used to be afraid he would go and get himself hitched to a fly-away.' 

' Euphemie Knowlton ? ' said Mrs. Salter. ' Yes, I 
used to wonder if we shouldn't get our minister's wife 
from Elmfield. It looked likely at one time.' 

' Those two wouldn't ha' pulled well together, ne ver,' 
said another. 

' I should like to know how he and Di's goin' to pull 
together ? ' said Mrs. Flandin acidly. ' He goin' one way, 
and she another.' 

' Do you think so, Mrs. Flandin ? ' asked the lady thus, 
in a very uncomplimentary manner, referred to. 

' Wall ain't it true ? ' said Mrs. Flandin judicially. 

' I do not think it is true.' 

'Wall, I'm glad to hear it, I'm sure,' said the other ; 
'but there's a word in the Scriptur about two walking 
together when they ain't agreed.' 

' Mr. Masters and I are agreed, ' said Diana, while 
her lips parted in a very slight smile and a lovely tinge of 
rose-colour came over her cheeks. 

' But not in everything, I reckon ? ' 

' In everything I know,' said Diana steadily, while a 
- considerable breeze of laughter went round the room. 
Mrs. Flandin was getting the worst of it. 

' Then it'll be the worse for him ! ' she remarked with 
a jerk at her sewing. Diana was silent now, but Mrs. 
Boddington took it up. 




' Do you mean to say, Mis' Flandin, you approve of 
quarrels between man and wife ? and quarrels in high 
places too ? ' 

' High places ! ' echoed Mrs. Flandin. ' When it says 
that a minister is to be the servant of all ! ' 

' And ain't he ? ' said Mrs. Carpenter. ' Is there a place 
or a thing our minister don't go to if he's wanted ? and 
does he mind whether it's night or day, or rough or smooth, 
and does he care how fur it is, or how long he goes without his victuals ? I will say, I never did see a no more 
self-forgetful man than is Mr. Masters; and I've a good 
right to know, and I say it with feelin's of gratitude.' 

'That's jes' so,' said Miss Barry, her eyes glistening 
over her knitting, which they did not need to watch. And 
there was a hum of assent through the room. 

' I'm not sayin' nothin' agin him,' said Mrs. Flandin in 
an injured manner; 'but what I was hintin' I warn't 
sayin' nothin', is that he's married a ' 

' A beauty ' said Mrs. Boddington. 

' I don't set no count on beauty,' said the other. ' I 
allays think, ef a minister is a servant of the Lord, and I 
hope Mr. Masters is, it's a pity his wife shouldn't be too. 
That's all.' 

' But I am, Mrs. Flandin,' said Diana quietly. 

' What ? ' 

' A servant of the Lord.' 

' Since when ? ' demanded the other incredulously. 

' Does it matter, since when ? ' said Diana, with a calm 
gentleness which spoke for her. ' I was not always so, 
but I am now.' 

' Hev' you met with a change ? ' the other asked, again 
judicially, and critically. 

' Yes.' 



 

' Ain't that good news, now ! ' said Miss Barry dropping 
her knitting and fairly wiping her eyes. 

' I hope your evidences is clear,' said the other lady. 

' Do you want to hear what they are ? ' said Diana. ' I 
have come to know the Lord Jesus I have come to believe in him I have given myself to be his servant. As 
truly his servant, though not so good a one, as my husband 
is. But what he bids me, I'll do.' 

The little assembly was silent, silent all round. Both 
the news and the manner of the teller of it were imposing. Decided, clear, calm, sweet, Diana's grey eyes as 
well as her lips gave her testimony ; they did not shrink 
from other eyes, nor droop in hesitation or difficulty ; as 
little was there a line of daring or self-assertion about 
them. The dignity of the woman struck and hushed her 
companions. 

' Our minister'll be a happy man, I'm thinkin',' said 
good Mrs. Carpenter, speaking out what was the secret 
thought of many present. 

'You haven't joined the church, Diana,' said Mrs. 
Starling harshly. 

' I will do that the first opportunity, mother.' 

' That's your husband's doing. I allays knew he'd wile 
a bird off a bush ! ' 

' I am very thankful to him' said Diana calmly. 

That calm of hers was unapproachable. It would 
neither take offence nor give it ; although it is true it did 
irritate some of her neighbours and companions by the very 
distance it put between them and her. Diana was different from them, and growing more different ; yet it was 
hard to find fault. She was so handsome too ; that helped 
the effect of superiority ; and her dress, what was there 
about her dress ? It was a pale lilac muslin, no way remarkable in itself ; but it fell around lines so soft and noble, 
and about so queenly a carriage, it waved with so quiet 
and graceful motions ; there was a temptation to think Diana must have called in dressmaking aid that was not lawful for the minister's wife. As the like often happens, Diana was set apart by a life-long sorrow from all their world 
of experience, and they thought she was proud. 

' What did you pay for that muslin, Diana ? ' Mrs. Flandin asked. 

' Fifteenpence.' 

' Du tell ! well I should ha' thought it was more,' remarked Miss Gunn. ' It's made so elegant.' 

' I made it myself,' said Diana smiling. 

' Du tell ! ' said Miss Gunn again, reviewing the gown. 
For, as I hinted, its draperies were graceful, their lovely 
lines being unbroken by furbelows and flummery ; and the 
sleeves were open and half long with a full ruffle which fell 
away from Diana's beautiful arms. 

' How Phemie Knowlton used to dress ! ' Miss Gunn 
went on, moved by some hidden association of ideas. 

' I wonder is nobody ever comin' back to Elmfield ? ' 
said Mrs. Boddington. ' They don't do nothin' with the 
place, and it's just waste.' 

The talk wandered on ; but Diana's thoughts remained 
fixed. They had flown back over the two years since 
Evan and she had their explanation in the blackberry field, 
and for a little while she sat in a dream, feeling the stings 
of pain that seemed, she thought, to grow more lively now, 
instead of less. The coming in of Mr. Masters roused her, 
and with a sort of start she put away the thought of Evan 
and of days and joys past for ever, and forcibly swung herself back to present things. People were very well-behaved! 
after her husband came, and she did her part, she knew, 



 

satisfactorily; for she saw his eye now and then resting on 
her or meeting her's with the hidden smile in it she had 
learned to know. And besides, nothing was ever dull 
or commonplace where he was ; so even in Mrs. Starling's 
house and Mrs. Flandin's presence the rest of the evening 
went brightly off. And then, driving home, through the 
light of a young moon and over the quiet country, Diana 
watched the wonderful calm line where the hill-tops met 
the sky ; and thought, surely, with the talisman she had 
just found, of heavenly love and sympathy and strength, 
she could walk the rest of her way through life and bear 
it till the end. Then, by and by, beyond that dividing 
line of eternity, there would be bright heaven, instead of 
the dusky earth. If only she could prevent Basil from 
knowing how she felt and so losing all peace in life himself. But his peace was so fixed in heaven, she wondered 
if anything on earth could destroy it ? She would not try 
that question. 



CHAPTER XXV. 
MISS COLLINS' WORK. 

IT was well for Diana that she had got a talisman, of better power than the world can manufacture. It was well for 
her too that she followed up earnestly the clue to life which
