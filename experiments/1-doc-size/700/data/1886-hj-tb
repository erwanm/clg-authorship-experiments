Place worth placing under the rose, was quenched for the 
moment in his regret at not being able to let his disagree- 
able cousin know that he had passed her over. ' Don't you 
remember my hearing her speak that night at Miss Birds- 
eye's?' he said, presently. 'And I met her the next day 
at your house, you know.' 

'  She has developed greatly since then/ Olive remarked 
drily; and Ransom felt sure that Verena had held her 
tongue. 

At this moment a gentleman made his way through the 
clusters of Mrs. Burrage's guests and presented himself to 
Olive. ' If you will do me the honour to take my arm I 
will find a good seat for you in the other room. It's 
getting to be time for Miss Tarrant to reveal herself. I 
have been taking her into the picture-room ; there were 
some things she wanted to see. She is with my mother 
now,' he added, as if Miss Chancellor's grave face con- 
stituted a sort of demand for an explanation of her friend's 
absence. ' She said she was a little nervous ; so I thought 
we would just move about.' 

' It's the first time I have ever heard of that ! ' said Olive 
Chancellor, preparing to surrender herself to the young 
man's guidance. He told her that he had reserved the 
best seat for her ; it was evidently his desire to conciliate 
her, to treat her as a person of importance. Before leading 
her away, he shook hands with Ransom and remarked that 
he was very glad to see him; and Ransom saw that he 
must be the master of the house, though he could scarcely 
be the son of the stout lady in the doorway. He was a 
fresh, pleasant, handsome young man, with a bright friendly 
manner ; he recommended Ransom to take a seat in the 
other room, without delay ; if he had never heard Miss 



 

Tarrant he would have one of the greatest pleasures of his 
life. 

'Oh, Mr. Ransom only comes to ventilate his pre- 
judices,' Miss Chancellor said, as she turned her back to 
her kinsman. He shrank from pushing into the front of 
the company, which was now rapidly filling the music-room, 
and contented himself with lingering in the doorway, where 
several gentlemen were stationed. The seats were all 
occupied ; all, that is, save one, towards which he saw Miss 
Chancellor and her companion direct themselves, squeezing 
and edging past the people who were standing up against 
the walls. This was quite in front, close to the little 
platform ; every one noticed Olive as she went, and Ran- 
som heard a gentleman near him say to another ' I guess 
she's one of the same kind.' He looked for Verena, but 
she was apparently keeping out of sight. Suddenly he felt 
himself smartly tapped on the back, and, turning round, 
perceived Mrs. Luna, who had been prodding him with her 
fan. 



XXVII. 

'You won't speak to me in my own house that I have 
almost grown used to ; but if you are going to pass me over 
in public I think you might give me warning first.' This 
was only her archness, and he knew what to make of that 
now ; she was dressed in yellow and looked very plump and 
gay. He wondered at the unerring instinct by which she 
had discovered his exposed quarter. The outer room was 
completely empty; she had come in at the further door 
and found the field free for her operations. He offered to 
find her a place where she could see and hear Miss Tarrant, 
to get her a chair to stand on, even, if she wished to look 
over the heads of the gentlemen in the doorway; a proposal 
which she greeted with the inquiry '  Do you suppose I 
came here for the sake of that chatterbox ? haven't I told 
you what I think of her?' 

'Well, you certainly did not come here for my sake,' 
said Ransom, anticipating this insinuation ; ' for you 
couldn't possibly have known I was coming.' 

'I guessed it a presentiment told me!' Mrs. Luna 
declared; and she looked up at him with searching, 
accusing eyes. 'I know what you have come for,' she 
cried in a moment. ' You never mentioned to me that you 
knew Mrs. Burrage !' 

' I don't I never had heard of her till she asked me.' 
' Then why in the world did she ask you ?' 
Ransom had spoken a trifle rashly ; it came over him, 
quickly, that there were reasons why he had better not have 
said that. But almost as quickly he covered up his 
mistake. ' I suppose your sister was so good as to ask for 
a card for me.' 

' My sister ? My grandmother ! I know how Olive 



 

loves you. Mr. Ransom, you are very deep.' She had 
drawn him well into the room, out of earshot of the group 
in the doorway, and he felt that if she should be able to 
compass her wish she would organise a little entertainment 
for herself, in the outer drawing-room, in opposition to Miss 
Tarrant's address. 'Please come and sit down here a 
moment; we shall be quite undisturbed. I have some- 
thing very particular to say to you/ She led the way to 
the little sofa in the corner, where he had been talking with 
Olive a few minutes before, and he accompanied her, with 
extreme reluctance, grudging the moments that he should 
be obliged to give to her. He had quite forgotten that he 
once had a vision of spending his life in her society, and 
he looked at his watch as he made the observation : 

' I haven't the least idea of losing any of the sport in 
there, you know.' 

He felt, the next instant, that he oughtn't to have said 
that either; but he was irritated, disconcerted, and he 
couldn't help it. It was in the nature of a gallant Missis- 
sippian to do everything a lady asked him, and he had never, 
remarkable as it may appear, been in the position of finding 
such a request so incompatible with his own desires as now. 
It was a new predicament, for Mrs. Luna evidently meant 
to keep him if she could. She looked round the room, 
more and more pleased at their having it to themselves, and 
for the moment said nothing more about the singularity of 
his being there. On the contrary, she became freshly 
jocular, remarked that now they had got hold of him they 
wouldn't easily let him go, they would make him entertain 
them, induce him to give a lecture on the ' Lights and 
Shadows of Southern Life,'- or the ' Social Peculiarities of 
Mississippi ' before the Wednesday Club. 

' And what in the world is the Wednesday Club ? I sup- 
pose it's what those ladies were talking about,' Ransom said. 

' I  don't know your ladies, but the Wednesday Club is 
this thing. I don't mean you and me here together, but 
all those deluded beings in the other room. It is New 
York trying to be like Boston. It is the culture, the good 
form, of the metropolis. You might not think it, but it is. 
It's the ' quiet set ' ; they are quiet enough ; you might 



 

hear a pin drop, in there. Is some one going to offer up a 
prayer? How happy Olive must be, to be taken so seri- 
ously ! They form an association for meeting at each 
other's houses, every week, and having some performance, 
or some paper read, or some subject explained. The more 
dreary it is and the more fearful the subject, the more they 
think it is what it ought to be. They have an idea this is 
the way to make New York society intellectual. There's a 
sumptuary law isn't that what you call it? about suppers, 
and they restrict themselves to a kind of Spartan broth. 
When it's made by their French cooks it isn't bad. Mrs. 
Burrage is one of the principal members one of the 
founders, I believe ; and when her turn has come round, 
formerly it comes only once in the winter for each I am 
told she has usually had very good music. But that is 
thought rather a base evasion, a begging of the question ; 
the vulgar set can easily keep up with them on music. So 
Mrs. Burrage conceived the extraordinary idea' and it was 
wonderful to hear how Mrs. Luna pronounced that adjective 
' of sending on to Boston for that girl. It was her son, 
of course, who put it into her head ; he has been at Cam- 
bridge for some years that's where Verena lived, you know 
and he was as thick with her as you please out there. 
Now that he is no longer there it suits him very well to 
have her here. She is coming on a visit to his mother 
when Olive goes. I asked them to stay with me, but Olive 
declined, majestically ; she said they wished to be in some 
place where they would be free to receive 'sympathising 
friends.' So they are staying at some extraordinary kind of 
New Jerusalem boarding-house, in Tenth Street; Olive 
thinks it's her duty to go to such places. I was greatly 
surprised that she should let Verena be drawn into such a 
worldly crowd as this ; but she told me they had made up 
their minds not to let any occasion slip, that they could sow 
the seed of truth in drawing-rooms as well as in workshops, 
and that if a single person was brought round to their ideas 
they should have been justified in coming on. That's what 
they are doing in there sowing the seed; but you shall 
not be the one that's brought round, I shall take care of 
that. Have you seen my delightful sister yet ? The way 



she does arrange herself when she wants to protest against 
frills ! She looks as if she thought it pretty barren ground 
round here, now she has come to see it. I don't think she 
thinks you can be saved in a French dress, anyhow. I must 
say I call it a very base evasion of Mrs. Burrage's, producing 
Verena Tarrant ; it's worse than the meretricious music. 
Why didn't she honestly send for a ballerina from Niblo's 
if she wanted a young woman capering about on a plat- 
form ? They don't care a fig about poor Olive's ideas ; it's 
only because Verena has strange hair, and shiny eyes, and 
gets herself up like a prestidigitator's assistant. I have 
never understood how Olive can reconcile herself to 
Verena's really low style of dress. I suppose it's only 
because her clothes are so fearfully made. You look as if 
you didn't believe me but I assure you that the cut is 
revolutionary ; and that's a salve to Olive's conscience/ 

Ransom was surprised to hear that he looked as if he 
didn't believe her, for he had found himself, after his first 
uneasiness, listening with considerable interest to her 
account of the circumstances under which Miss Tarrant was 
visiting New York. After a moment, as the result of some 
private reflection, he propounded this question : ' Is the 
son of the lady of the house a handsome young man, very 
polite, in a white vest?' 

' I don't know the colour of his vest but he has a 
kind of fawning manner. Verena judges from that that he 
is in love with her.' 

' Perhaps he is,' said Ransom. '  You say it was his 
idea to get her to come oa' 

' Oh, he likes to flirt ; that is highly probable.' 

'  Perhaps she has brought him round.' 

'Not to where she wants, I think. The property is 
very large ; he will have it all one of these days.' 

' Do you mean she wishes to impose on him the yoke 
of matrimony ?' Ransom asked, with Southern languor. 

' I believe she thinks matrimony an exploded super- 
stition ; but there is here and there a case in which it is 
still the best thing ; when the gentleman's name happens 
to be Burrage and the young lady's Tarrant I don't 
admire ' Burrage ' so much myself. But I think she would 



 

have captured this present scion if it hadn't been for Olive. 
Olive stands between them she wants to keep her in the 
single sisterhood ; to keep her, above all, for herself. Of 
course she won't listen to her marrying, and she has put a 
spoke in the wheel. She has brought her to New York ; 
that may seem against what I say ; but the girl pulls hard, 
she has to humour her, to give her her head sometimes, to 
throw something overboard, in short, to save the rest. You 
may say, as regards Mr. Burrage, that it's a queer taste in a 
gentleman ; but there is no arguing about that. It's queer 
taste in a lady, too ; for she is a lady, poor Olive. You 
can see that to-night. She is dressed like a book-agent, 
but she is more distinguished than any one here. Verena, 
beside her, looks like a walking advertisement.' 

When Mrs. Luna paused, Basil Ransom became aware 
that, in the other room, Verena's address had begun ; the 
sound of her clear, bright, ringing voice, an admirable voice 
for public uses, came to them from the distance. His 
eagerness to stand where he could hear her better, and see 
her into the bargain, made him start in his place, and this 
movement produced an outgush of mocking laughter on 
the part of his companion. But she didn't say ' Go, go, 
deluded man, I take pity on you !' she only remarked, with 
light impertinence, that he surely wouldn't be so wanting in 
gallantry as to leave a lady absolutely alone in a public 
place it was so Mrs. Luna was pleased to qualify Mrs. 
Burrage's drawing-room in the face of her entreaty that he 
would remain with her. She had the better of poor 
Ransom, thanks to the superstitions of Mississippi. It was 
in his simple code a gross rudeness to withdraw from con- 
versation with a lady at a party before another gentleman 
should have come to take one's place ; it was to inflict on 
the lady a kind of outrage. The other gentlemen, at Mrs. 
Burrage's, were all too well occupied; there was not the 
smallest chance of one of them coming to his rescue. He 
couldn't leave Mrs. Luna, and yet he couldn't stay with her 
and lose the only thing he had come so much out of his 
way for. ' Let me at least find you a place over there, in 
the doorway. You can stand upon a chair you can lean 
on me.' 



 

' Thank you very much ; I would much rather lean on 
this sofa. And I am much too tired to stand on chairs. 
Besides, I wouldn't for the world that either Verena or 
Olive should see me craning over the heads of the crowd 
as if I attached the smallest importance to their perora- 
tions !' 

'  It isn't time for the peroration yet/ Ransom said, with 
savage dryness ; and he sat forward, with his elbow on his 
knees, his eyes on the ground, a flush in his sallow cheek. 

' It's never time to say such things as those,' Mrs. Luna 
remarked, arranging her laces. 

' How do you know what she is saying?' 

'  I can tell by the way her voice goes up and down. It 
sounds so silly.' 

Ransom sat there five minutes longer minutes which, 
he felt, the recording angel ought to write down to his 
credit and asked himself how Mrs. Luna could be such a 
goose as not to see that she was making him hate her. 
But she was goose enough for anything. He tried to 
appear indifferent, and it occurred to him to doubt whether 
the Mississippi system could be right, after all. It certainly 
hadn't foreseen such a case as this. ' It's as plain as day 
that Mr. Burrage intends to marry her if he can,' he said 
in a minute ; that remark being better calculated than any 
other he could think of to dissimulate his real state of 
mind. 

It drew no rejoinder from his companion, and after an 
instant he turned his head a little and glanced at her. 
The result of something that silently passed between them 
was to make her say, abruptly : ' Mr. Ransom, my sister 
never sent you an invitation to this place. Didn't it come 
from Verena Tarrant?' 

' I haven't the least idea.' 

'  As you hadn't the least acquaintance with Mrs. Burrage, 
who else could it have come from ?' 

'If it came from Miss Tarrant, I ought at least to 
recognise her courtesy by listening to her.' 

' If you rise from this sofa I will tell Olive what I 
suspect. She will be perfectly capable of carrying Verena 
off to China or anywhere out of your reach.' 





'  And pray what is it you suspect?' 
' That you two have been in correspondence.' 
' Tell her whatever you like, Mrs. Luna, 7 said the young 
man, with the grimness of resignation. 
'You are quite unable to deny it, I see.' 

'  I never contradict a lady.' 

' We shall see if I can't make you tell a fib. Haven't 
you been seeing Miss Tarrant, too?' 

' Where should I have seen her ? I can't see all the way 
to Boston, as you said the other day.' 

'  Haven't you been there on secret visits?' 

Ransom started just perceptibly ; but to conceal it, the 
next instant, he stood up. 

' They wouldn't be secret if I were to tell you.' 

Looking down at her he saw that her words were a 
happy hit, not the result of definite knowledge. But she 
appeared to him vain, egotistical, grasping, odious. 

' Well, I shall give the alarm,' she went on ; ' that is, I 
will if you leave me. Is that the way a Southern gentle- 
man treats a lady? Do as I wish, and I will let you off!' 

'You won't let me off from staying with you.' 

' Is it such a corvee ? I never heard of such rudeness ! ' 
Mrs. Luna cried. 'All the same, I am determined to keep 
you if I can !' 

Ransom felt that she must be in the wrong, and yet 
superficially she seemed (and it was quite intolerable), to 
have right on her side. All this while Verena's golden 
voice, with her words indistinct, solicited, tantalised his ear. 
The question had evidently got on Mrs. Luna's nerves ; 
she had reached that point of feminine embroilment when 
a woman is perverse for the sake of perversity, and even 
with a clear vision of bad consequences. 

' You have lost your head,' he relieved himself by saying, 
as he looked down at her. 

'  I wish you would go and get me some tea.' 

' You say that only to embarrass me.' He had hardly 
spoken when a great sound of applause, the clapping of 
many hands, and the cry from fifty throats of 'Brava, brava !' 
floated in and died away. All Ransom's pulses throbbed, 
he flung his scruples to the winds, and after remarking to 



 

Mrs. Luna still with all due ceremony that he feared he 
must resign himself to forfeiting her good opinion, turned 
his back upon her and strode away to the open door of the 
music-room. ' Well, I have never been so insulted ! ' he 
heard her exclaim, with exceeding sharpness, as he left her; 
and, glancing back at her, as he took up his position, he 
saw her still seated on her sofa alone in the lamp-lit 
desert with her eyes making, across the empty space, little 
vindictive points. Well, she could come where he was, if 
she wanted him so much ; he would support her on an 
ottoman, and make it easy for her to see. But Mrs. Luna 
was uncompromising; he became aware, after a minute, 
that she had withdrawn, majestically, from the place, and 
he did not see her again that evening. 



XXVIII. 

HE could command the music-room very well from where 
he stood, behind a thick outer fringe of intently listening 
men. Verena Tarrant was erect on her little platform, 
dressed in white, with flowers in her bosom. The red 
cloth beneath her feet looked rich in the light of lamps 
placed on high pedestals on either side of the stage ; it 
gave her figure a setting of colour which made it more 
pure and salient. She moved freely in her exposed isola- 
tion, yet with great sobriety of gesture ; there was no table 
in front of her, and she had no notes in her hand, but 
stood there like an actress before the footlights, or a singer 
spinning vocal sounds to a silver thread. There was such 
a risk that a slim provincial girl, pretending to fascinate a 
couple of hundred blase New Yorkers by simply giving them 
her ideas, would fail of her effect, that at the end of a few 
moments Basil Ransom became aware that he was watching 
her in very much the same excited way as if she had been 
performing, high above his head, on the trapeze. Yet, as 
one listened, it was impossible not to perceive that she was 
in perfect possession of her faculties, her subject, her 
audience; and he remembered the other time at Miss 
Birdseye's well enough to be able to measure the ground 
she had travelled since then. This exhibition was much 
more complete, her manner much more assured ; she 
seemed to speak and survey the whole place from a much 
greater height. Her voice, too, had developed ; he had 
forgotten how beautiful it could be when she raised it to its 
full capacity. Such a tone as that, so pure and rich, and 
yet so young, so natural, constituted in itself a talent ; he 
didn't wonder that they had made a fuss about her at the 
Female Convention, if she filled their hideous hall with 



 

such a music. He had read, of old, of the improvisatrice 
of Italy, and this was a chastened, modern, American 
version of the type, a New England Corinna, with a mission 
instead of a lyre. The most graceful part of her was her 
earnestness, the way her delightful eyes, wandering over the 
' fashionable audience ' (before which she was so perfectly 
unabashed), as if she wished to resolve it into a single 
sentient personality, seemed to say that the only thing in 
life she cared for was to put the truth into a form that 
would render conviction irresistible. She was as simple as 
she was charming, and there was not a glance or motion 
that did not seem part of the pure, still-burning passion 
that animated her. She had indeed it was manifest 
reduced the company to unanimity \ their attention was 
anything but languid ; they smiled back at her when she 
smiled ; they were noiseless, motionless when she was 
solemn ; and it was evident that the entertainment which 
Mrs. Burrage had had the happy thought of offering to her 
friends would be memorable in the annals of the Wednesday 
Club. It was agreeable to Basil Ransom to think that 
Verena noticed him in his corner ; her eyes played over 
her listeners so freely that you couldn't say they rested in 
one place more than another ; nevertheless, a single rapid 
ray, which, however, didn't in the least strike him as a 
deviation from her ridiculous, fantastic, delightful argument, 
let him know that he had been missed and now was par- 
ticularly spoken to. This glance was a sufficient assurance 
that his invitation had come to him by the girl's request. 
He took for granted the matter of her speech was ridiculous; 
how could it help being, and what did it signify if it was ? 
She was none the less charming for that, and the moonshine 
she had been plied with was none the less moonshine for 
her being charming. After he had stood there a quarter of 
an hour he became conscious that he should not be able to 
repeat a word she had said ; he had not definitely heeded 
it, and yet he had not lost a vibration of her voice. He 
had discovered Olive Chancellor by this time ; she was in 
the front row of chairs, at the end, on the left ; her back 
was turned to him, but he could see half her sharp profile, 
bent down a little and absolutely motionless. Even across 



 

the wide interval her attitude expressed to him a kind of 
rapturous stillness, the concentration of triumph. There 
were several irrepressible effusions of applause, instantly 
self-checked, but Olive never looked up, at the loudest, 
and such a calmness as that could only be the result of 
passionate volition. Success was in the air, and she was 
tasting it ; she tasted it, as she did everything, in a way of 
her own. Success for Verena was success for her, and 
Ransom was sure that the only thing wanting to her triumph 
was that he should have been placed in the line of her 
vision, so that she might enjoy his embarrassment and con- 
fusion, might say to him, in one of her dumb, cold flashes 
' Now do you think our movement is not a force now 
do you think that women are meant to be slaves ?' Honestly, 
he was not conscious of any confusion ; it subverted none 
of his heresies to perceive that Verena Tarrant had even 
more power to fix his attention than he had hitherto 
supposed. It was fixed in a way it had not been yet, 
however, by his at last understanding her speech, feeling it 
reach his inner sense through the impediment of mere 
dazzled vision. Certain phrases took on a meaning for him 
an appeal she was making to those who still resisted the 
beneficent influence of the truth. They appeared to be 
mocking, cynical men, mainly ; many of whom were such 
triflers and idlers, so heartless and brainless that it didn't 
matter much what they thought on any subject ; if the old 
tyranny needed to be propped up by them it showed it was 
in a pretty bad way. But there were others whose prejudice 
was stronger and more cultivated, pretended to rest upon study 
and argument. To those she wished particularly to address 
herself; she wanted to waylay them, to say, 'Look here, 
you're all wrong ; you'll be so much happier when I have 
convinced you. Just give me five minutes,' she should like 
to say ; 'just sit down here and let me ask a simple question. 
Do you think any state of society can come to good that is 
based upon an organised wrong?' That was the simple 
question that Verena desired to propound, and Basil smiled 
across the room at her with an amused tenderness as he 
gathered that she conceived it to be a poser. He didn't 
think it would frighten him much if she were to ask him 



 

that, and he would sit down with her for as many minutes 
as she liked. 

He, of course, was one of the systematic scoffers, one of 
those to whom she said ' Do you know how you strike 
me? You strike me as men who are starving to death 
while they have a cupboard at home, all full of bread and 
meat and wine ; or as blind, demented beings who let 
themselves be cast into a debtor's prison, while in their 
pocket they have the key of vaults and treasure -chests 
heaped up with gold and silver. The meat and wine, the 
gold and silver,' Verena went on, ' are simply the suppressed 
and wasted force, the precious sovereign remedy, of which 
society insanely deprives itself the genius, the intelligence, 
the inspiration of women. It is dying, inch by inch, in the 
midst of old superstitions which it invokes in vain, and yet 
it has the elixir of life in its hands. Let it drink but a draught, 
and it will bloom once more ; it will be refreshed, radiant ; it 
will find its youth again. The heart, the heart is cold, and 
nothing but the touch of woman can warm it, make it act. We 
are the Heart of humanity, and let us have the courage to 
insist on it ! The public life of the world will move in the 
same barren, mechanical, vicious circle the circle of ego- 
tism, cruelty, ferocity, jealousy, greed, of blind striving to do 
things only for some, at the cost of others, instead of trying 
to do everything for all. All, all ? Who dares to say " all " 
when we are not there ? We are an equal, a splendid, an 
inestimable part. Try us and you'll see you will wonder 
how, without us, society has ever dragged itself even this 
distance so wretchedly small compared with what it might 
have been on its painful earthly pilgrimage. That is what 
I should like above all to pour into the ears of those who 
still hold out, who stiffen their necks and repeat hard, 
empty formulas, which . are as dry as a broken gourd that 
has been flung away in the desert. I would take them by 
their selfishness, their indolence, their interest. I am not 
here to recriminate, nor to deepen the gulf that already 
yawns between the sexes, and I don't accept the doctrine 
that they are natural enemies, since my plea is for a union 
far more intimate provided it be equal than any that the 
sages and philosophers of former times have ever dreamed 



 

of. Therefore I shall not touch upon the subject of men's 
being most easily influenced by considerations of what is 
most agreeable and profitable for them; I shall simply 
assume that they are so influenced, and I shall say to them 
that our cause would long ago have been gained if their 
vision were not so dim, so veiled, even in matters in which 
their own interests are concerned. If they had the same 
quick sight as women, if they had the intelligence of the 
heart, the world would be very different now ; and I assure 
you that half the bitterness of our lot is to see so clearly 
and not to be able to do ! Good gentlemen all, if I could 
make you believe how much brighter and fairer and sweeter 
the garden of life would be for you, if you would only let 
us help you to keep it in order ! You would like so much 
better to walk there, and you would find grass and trees 
and flowers that would make you think you were in Eden. 
That is what I should like to press home to each of you, 
personally, individually to give him the vision of the world 
as it hangs perpetually before me, redeemed, transfigured, 
by a new moral tone. There would be generosity, tender- 
ness, sympathy, where there is now only brute force and 
sordid rivalry. But you really do strike me as stupid even 
about your own welfare ! Some of you say that we have 
already all the influence we can possibly require, and talk 
as if we ought to be grateful that we are allowed even to 
breathe. Pray, who shall judge what we require if not we 
ourselves? We require simply freedom; we require the 
lid to be taken off the box in which we have been kept for 
centuries. You say it's a very comfortable, cozy, con- 
venient box, with nice glass sides, so that we can see out, 
and that all that's wanted is to give another quiet turn to 
the key. That is very easily answered. Good gentlemen, 
you have never been in the box, and you haven't the least 
idea how it feels !' 

The historian who has gathered these documents 
together does not deem it necessary to give a larger 
specimen of Verena's eloquence, especially as Basil Ran- 
som, through whose ears we are listening to it, arrived, at 
this point, at a definite conclusion. He had taken her 
measure as a public speaker, judged her importance in the 



 

field of discussion, the cause of reform. Her speech, in 
itself, had about the value of a pretty essay, committed to 
memory and delivered by a bright girl at an 'academy;' 
it was vague, thin, rambling, a tissue of generalities that 
glittered agreeably enough in Mrs. Burrage's veiled lamplight. 
From any serious point of view it was neither worth 
answering nor worth considering, and Basil Ransom made 
his reflections on the crazy character of the age in which 
such a performance as that was treated as an intellectual 
effort, a contribution to a question. He asked himself 
what either he or any one else would think of it if Miss 
Chancellor or even Mrs. Luna had been on the platform 
instead of the actual declaimer. Nevertheless, its import- 
ance was high, and consisted precisely, in part, of the fact 
that the voice was not the voice of Olive or of Adeline. 
Its importance was that Verena was unspeakably attractive, 
and this was all the greater for him in the light of the fact, 
which quietly dawned upon him as he stood there, that he 
was falling in love with her. It had tapped at his heart 
for recognition, and before he could hesitate or challenge, 
the door had sprung open and the mansion was illuminated. 
He gave no outward sign ; he stood gazing as at a picture ; 
but the room wavered before his eyes, even Verena's figure 
danced a little. This did not make the sequel of her 
discourse more clear to him ; her meaning faded again into 
the agreeable vague, and he simply felt her presence, tasted 
her voice. Yet the act of reflection was not suspended ; 
he found himself rejoicing that she was so weak in argument, 
so inevitably verbose. The idea that she was brilliant, that 
she counted as a factor only because the public mind was 
in a muddle, was not an humiliation but a delight to him ; 
it was a proof that her apostleship was all nonsense, the 
most passing of fashions, the veriest of delusions, and that 
she was meant for something divinely different for privacy, 
for him, for love. He took no measure of the duration of 
her talk ; he only knew, when it was over and succeeded 
by a clapping of hands, an immense buzz of voices and 
shuffling of chairs, that it had been capitally bad, and that 
her personal success, wrapping it about with a glamour like 
the silver mist that surrounds a fountain, was such as to 



 

prevent its badness from being a cause of mortification to 
her lover. The company such of it as did not imme- 
diately close together around Verena filed away into the 
other rooms, bore him in its current into the neighbourhood 
of a table spread for supper, where he looked for signs of 
the sumptuary law mentioned to him by Mrs. Luna. It 
appeared to be embodied mainly in the glitter of crystal 
and silver, and the fresh tints of mysterious viands and
