that this unnatural condition gave a subtle 
deflection to her own lot. It threw her more 
than usual into the society of Olin Steele ; and 
the young professor did not talk about lost 
dogs. He had expressed his regret for Dan's 
affliction in language that he felt would appeal 
to the excessive sympathy which he perceived 
Miss Lauriat to be cherishing. It was a re- 
lief to him that she evidently preferred not 
to discuss the matter, and thereafter he tact- 
fully avoided it. One day he happened to 
say: 



 

" I lost Barry once. He was gone a week. 
I had the whole state looking for him." 

Miss Lauriat received this remark in silence 
so unlike herself that he looked at her shrewdly. 
He was not naturally patient with inattention 
to what he chose to say. Some day, he thought, 
he would ask her what she meant by it. 

Some day — ah, that day ! As God lived, 
he swore, its sun should rise and set. In the 
magic of its haze, in the marvel of its splen- 
dor, she should be his. Oh, and willingly ! 
Yes, and joyfully. For his love had grown 
fastidious, epicurean. At the first, as he had 
told himself, he meant to win her " anyhow." 
Now, this would not content him. She — no 
subject that he should seize her against her 
own heart's will — she, the strongest and ten- 
derest woman whom he had ever known — 
she, out of whose strength came her sweetness, 
and whose capacity for love he knew that no 
heart had measured — she should come to him 
like any lesser woman, yielding, and glad to 
yield. Oh, she should crave him — as he, her. 
She should hunger and thirst for his love as he 
had hungered and thirsted — and maddened 
and waited — for hers. 



 

He pursued his suit with the ardor of an 
oriental despot, and the tactics of an occiden- 
tal diplomat. He knew he was gaining upon 
her defenses ; he made havoc with her reluc- 
tance ; he antedated his triumphs in a delirium 
of victory the mightier because it was con- 
trolled and unexpressed, and already he flaunted 
banners in his own heart. 

Miriam treated him with a guarded sweet- 
ness which at times took on the tint of tender- 
ness, and at others deepened into reserve 
amounting almost to rebuff. Then she would 
pause again, and seem to wait and look at him 
over her shoulder. It could not be said that 
as yet she experienced either peace or joy ; 
but she was now conscious of living in a world 
apart with Olin Steele. 

It has long been one of the psychological 
mysteries that a delicately reared and finely 
fibred woman may idealize a man of coarser 
grain and manifestly lower moral nature. Even 
an infatuation for brute force may possess an 
otherwise clear-headed and true-hearted wo- 
man. Call such emotional defectives; from their 
lineage Miriam Lauriat's was by the heaven's 
width removed ; yet was she subtly swept 



 

within the extended shadow of that unhappy 
fate? Sheer physical perfection did not in- 
terest her. If she had been thrown solitary 
upon some planet with a low-browed, dull- 
minded gladiator, he would not have attracted 
her in any sense of the word. But to intel- 
lectual athletics she was very sensitive, and 
this kind of prowess she felt in Steele. His 
well-trained mind, his large learning, his pro- 
fessional preeminence, commanded her. In his 
department he was a scholar ; in conversation 
he was stimulating, in manner finished, in 
character without reproach; and in the diffi- 
cult art of courtship he was without fear. In 
love he would take no denial. He surrounded 
her with a sense of power more dangerous to 
her because more fine than the kind of domi- 
nation to which a weaker woman yields. 

Miriam was besieged by his determination. 
She had begun to feel that she had no escape 
from the strategy of a love that was all will, 
and of a will that had become all love. 

"I suppose you know," said Philip Sur- 
bridge one day, " I suppose you understand — 
pardon me — what Olin Steele is ? " 

Surbridge turned very pale as he uttered 



 

these words. They seemed to be forced from 
his lips by a deliberate and solemn purpose, 
that he would have concealed, if he could, in 
an incidental manner. 

Miriam lifted her chin with that pretty, 
haughty motion which Philip so seldom saw. 

" Why, everybody knows. He is professor 
at Galen. He is at the head of one of the 
most important departments in the school." 

She brought these sentences out with little 
dents between as if she had bitten them. 

" But you know," Philip hesitated, " you 
know what he teaches ? You know what he 
does ? " 

"He teaches physiology," said Miriam 
proudly. " It is the basis of all medical edu- 
cation. I understand he teaches it thoroughly 
and brilliantly." 

Philip looked at her in silence. There was 
a certain compassion in his eyes which hers 
instantly resented. 

" Is there anything new about Trixy ? " 
she asked abruptly. " Any more clues ? " 

" Yes, a new one. And there may be some- 
thing in it. I came to say so, but I see you 
don't wish to hear about it this morning." 



 

"I will hear it to-morrow," answered Miriam 
nervously. u Tell me all about it to-morrow." 

But to-morrow when he came to tell her, 
she had gone to the shore ; and Steele had 
followed her. Maggie handed Surbridge a 
hurried note which had been left at the town 
house for him. 

Dear Philip [it said] : I am tired out 
and nervous, and I am gone to spend a 
couple of days with Aunt Cornelia. Telephone 
if I am needed. It occurs to me that if you 
have a new clue you may need to increase 
your detective force. I inclose a signed check, 
which you will please fill out to any extent 
that the expenses of the search for Trixy may 
require. I cannot tell you how I feel about 
what you are doing, and the way in which you 
are doing it. All I can say is that it 's just 
like you. I am a good deal worried about 
some other matters, and I must leave it all 
to you. How many times in my life I have 
done that ! 

I am always your grateful and faithful 
Miriam Lauriat. 



 

There was no moon, and the early Septem- 
ber dark had shut in softly. The sky was 
lightly clouded, with only here and there a star. 
The black gulf of the sea lay sheer below the 
piazza, and the rising tide reverberated against 
the cliff which rose straight as the side of a 
canon. In fact, the broad piazza overlapped 
the water, and one had the sense of hanging 
in mid-air above the abyss. The night was 
warm, the wind southerly, and the surf heavy. 

Miriam and Steele sat side by side in the 
screened, half-lighted place. The long, un- 
shaded windows revealed Aunt Cornelia read- 
ing by a lamp with a blue globe that lent to 
her face the ghastly effect which it is given 
only to this particular species of domestic art 
to offer. In fact, it seemed to color the shaft 
of light that lay across the piazza ; this had a 
sickly tint like light blue marble. It made 
Miriam uncomfortable, and she moved into 
the shadow. Steele immediately followed, tak- 
ing a piazza chair directly in front of her. 
She stirred uneasily, and made as if she would 
lean over the railing of the piazza, but the 
galvanized wire netting prevented. She drew 
back impatiently. 




" These screens keep the mosquitoes out — 
but the comfort, too. What 's the use of a 
piazza that you can't look over ? I feel as if 
I were in a cage." 

" And so you are," said Olin Steele. 

When Miriam looked up and saw his face, 
half black in the shadow, half pale in the cold 
light, every drop of red blood deserted her own. 

" Why did you come to-night ? " she 
pleaded. " I did not expect you." 

" Why did you try to escape me ? " he de- 
manded. " I do not permit you." 

Miriam's chin rose instinctively with its 
haughty motion. 

" I have given you no right to speak to me 
like that ! " 

" No," he said firmly, " but you are going 
to give it to me." 

He was obliged to speak very distinctly, or 
the roar of the surf would have quenched his 
voice. Ten feet away nothing they said could 
have been heard. They were shut apart in 
the raffe of wind and wave. 

" I have waited till I can wait no more," he 
said desperately. " You have played with me 
as long as I can bear it." 



 

" I have never played with you ! " cried 
Miriam. 

" Well, defied me, then ; it is the same thing. 
I have resolved to end it. My misery " — 

" Are you miserable ? " asked Miriam, with 
unexpected tenderness. " I don't want to 
make you — unhappy." 

"I know you don't," said Steele, "because 
you love me." 

Miriam flung her hands up against the 
screen ; he thought how well she had spoken 
when she called it a cage. Her whole being 
seemed to beat upon it. She looked like a 
creature entrapped. 

"You love me," he insisted, "only you won't 
own it. You won't own it to yourself — or 
to me." 

Miriam's forehead fell against the metal 
netting. She felt the spray from the gulf fifty 
feet below upon her face. " Oh, perhaps I 
do," she sighed, " perhaps I do." 

The noise of the surf was so great that 
Steele could not be sure he had distinctly un- 
derstood her. His heart throbbed in his body 
as the waves throbbed on the rocks ; his brain 
hammered on his temples. 



 

" Let me hear it ! " he cried. " Let me hear 
it again." 

Miriam lifted her head and raised her eyes. 
In them he might have seen the infinite sad- 
ness with which a woman yields to a powerful 
but imperfect love. " Perhaps I do," she re- 
peated, "lam afraid I do." 

As the waves to the shore Steele turned 
towards her. Her soft shoulder quivered be- 
neath his arm. She felt his breath on her 
cheek. Then Miriam shrank. 

" Oh, no ! Not now ! Not yet ! I can't — 
Not yet — not yet ! " 

In a moment, without seeming to repel, she 
had eluded him. So mystery eludes science, 
so the spirit escapes the body. Trembling and 
white she leaned against the fine, invisible 
bars of the narrowing space in which they 
stood together. She regarded him solemnly. 
There was that in her eyes before which Steele 
felt his head grow light ; but he could no 
more have touched her than he could have 
torn the sphinx from the desert. 

" Next time ! " she entreated. " Perhaps 
next time." 

Steele's outstretched arms fell. 



 

" I shall reprieve you/' he said very slowly, 
" till next time." 

Now, Miriam, wincing from these words, yet 
leaning to them, hid her face upon her hands, 
and when she lifted it he had left her. 

" That was merciful," she thought, and the 
tide of her tenderness for the man rose by 
one of the abrupt and powerful waves below 
whose high- water line, if the laws of feeling 
are not intercepted, a woman's love will not 
ebb. Sensitively craving solitude, she opened 
the screen door that led from the piazza to 
the garden, and, hardly knowing what she 
did, or why she did it, paced to and fro alone 
with wild feet among the frosted flowers. The 
nasturtiums and salvia were still alive, and 
since she brushed and bruised them, they 
splashed her white woolen dress with red petals 
that clung to it. 

But when, an hour later, she went into the 
house, she found Aunt Cornelia excited and 
annoyed. Philip Surbridge had been ringing 
at the telephone ever since Dr. Steele went 
away. " And I told him you had probably 
jumped into the ocean, for I could not find 
you high or low." 



 

"And what," Miriam inquired absently, 
"did Philip say?" 

" He said : ' When she jumps out again 
tell her I called her up on a matter of some 
importance, but she 's not to mind ; she can 
leave it all to me.' And I must say, Miriam " — 

But Miriam did not stay to hear what Aunt 
Cornelia must say. 

In the city the September night was sad 
and sultry, and Surbridge, who had hurried 
back to his rooms after his ineffectual effort 
to consult Miriam by telephone, flung open 
the window and leaned out a little over the 
sill for a breath of such air as there was. As 
he did so he heard the thud, thudding of a 
rubber-tipped crutch upon the sidewalk, and 
the uneven sound of a crippled foot trailing 
with it. Both stopped directly beneath his 
window. 

" Mr. Surbridge, sir ? " 

" Yes, Dan, yes, — anything more ? " 

" Oh, sir, I 've found — Oh, sir ! " Dan 
stood choking. Terrible sobs tore the words 
out of the lad's throat. He held up something 
in his shaking hands. 



 

" I can't see, Dan. Don't try to come up ! 
It 's two flights — I will come down." 

Surbridge ran down and out upon the side- 
walk. Dan stood staring at him. 

" I 've come — to count on — you," gasped 
the boy. With a feeble moan as if his own 
life were gashed out of him from a severed 
artery, Dan laid across Surbridge' s arm a little 
dog's coat of blue flannel, soiled and stained 
and torn. Part of the embroidered name on 
the coat had been worn off or cut off ; but 
some of the stitches were left where the let- 
tering had been, and by the street lamp Sur- 
bridge plainly read : 



IXY 



CHAPTER VIII 

The night, which was warm at the shore, and 
sultry in the city, was stifling in the labora- 
tory. The windows were closed. This was 
found desirable because complaints had arisen 
in the neighborhood of occasional strange 
sounds that seemed to come from the school 
of science. It was rumored that protests from 
the art school had taken shape ; that the hot- 
headed old signor had complained of some- 
thing affecting the nerves of his pupils. In 
the rear of the medical building was a hospi- 
tal, and during the hot weather when windows 
were open, patients had described to their 
nurses and doctors signs of animal distress 
which now and then disturbed the human 
sick. 

The medical school of Galen was an an- 
cient and independent institution, not affiliated 
with a university. All that age, endowment, 
and intellectual prestige could bestow was at 
the command of this powerful scientific centre. 



 

Its alumni could be found throughout the 
civilized world, and cherished a remarkably 
strong attachment to their school. They were 
ready to defend her as most men defend their 
country's flag, through evil report and good, 
were she right or were she wrong. Among 
the graduates (and especially, let it be noted, 
among the elder men belonging to an earlier 
day, before modern physiology had begun to 
control the curriculum) were to be found many 
of the noblest representatives of the medical 
profession — men of aspiration, self-denial, and 
consecration ; men on whom the sick leaned, 
and whom the dying trusted; men whom wo- 
men honored, and children loved, and the 
poor blessed ; men who hesitated at no sacri- 
fice, halted at no danger, and who would hurl 
away their own lives without a thought, to 
save a patient. These men, too busy in heal- 
ing the sick to inflict the ingenuities of a de- 
cadent science upon small, speechless creatures, 
thought little and knew less about what was 
going on in the fastnesses of their own medical 
school. Yet, the moment when her fair fame 
should be touched, they would spring to her 
defense like soldiers blindly following the 



 

colors through a fight in a fog. So widely 
scattered and so deeply united were the alumni 
of this celebrated school that they carried its 
powerful influence everywhere, and sustained 
in the public mind a respect for the institution 
amounting to idealization. Among the first to 
recognize and respond to this pervasive influ- 
ence had been the men of fortune. A multi- 
millionaire, who had devoted his superfluous 
thousands for some years to the endowment 
of societies for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals, one summer day upon a yachting 
cruise fell under the beguiling influence of 
the old professor of physiology at Galen 
— since gathered to his fate in a world where 
he may look long for a congenial occupation. 
The result was that Galen, although, as we 
say, a very ancient school, had a very modern 
building. This — a gift outright from the 
philanthropic capitalist who had devoted him- 
self hitherto to the interests of animals — was 
new from roof to cellar. It was not intended 
necessarily to be a replica of other buildings 
of its kind. The old professor had full swing, 
and had carried into execution some ideas of 
his own. 



 

The first floor of the school was given up 
to the lecture-rooms, offices, and so on, and 
to the physiological laboratory. This was sep- 
arated from the lecture-room which we shall 
call the amphitheatre by a short passageway, 
and by double and deadened walls. Every de- 
vice that the modern building art could offer 
for the dulling of sound had been employed. 
Floors and ceilings were tremendously thick, 
and heavily lined with mineral wool. In the 
basement of the building the unhappy crea- 
tures who furnished the material for experi- 
mental physiology were confined. The room 
where the dumb prisoners were incarcerated 
was in a wing ; some of its windows looked upon 
a yard that separated it from the hospital. 

This lower room could be reached in several 
ways ; for instance, by two flights of stairs — 
one running from the physiological labora- 
tory — and by a corridor that led out to the 
rear of the building. This corridor, which 
ramified in more than one direction, led to a 
low door (one of several exits) somewhat hid- 
den from observation by a porch or balcony 
whose purpose seemed to be ornamental only. 
This door, which opened upon an alle} r , was 



 

used by the janitor and laboratory assistants. 
Most of the students knew nothing of its ex- 
istence, and a casual passer would not have 
noticed it. The corridor of which mention has 
been made contained two closets ; one was 
used for the disposal of brooms, mops, snow- 
shovels, pails, and so on ; another for hanging 
coats and hats. This latter closet was not far 
from the low door of which we have spoken. 

It was now eleven o'clock. In the hospital 
the sick slept, or prayed that they might do 
so before dawn. In the school of the arts 
the silent studio, at night given over to the 
shades and shapes of beautiful things, aroused 
slowly to the consciousness of itself. The 
antiques regarded each other solemnly ; the 
statue of Pity seemed to breathe and turn 
its face ; but the figure of the Christ did not 
stir ; it hung at about the height of a cross, 
upon the wall. In the medical school a few 
stray students had finished their work in the 
dissecting room and had gone for the night. 
With the exception of the janitor and the 
engineer, the building was deserted now of 
human presence, and in its upper stories quiet. 
In the basement it could seldom be called 




quiet. In that inferno the circles of misery 
gave out the inarticulate expression of a doom 
worse because neither understood, elected, nor 
deserved. For the most part these signs of 
anguish were gentle and docile, and at night 
were much in abeyance. Now and then a dog 
howled, or, if not badly injured, barked ; and 
broken moans of pain answered from some 
awakened or some dreaming creature ; but 
most of the victims endured with the silence 
and patience by which the suffering animal 
shames the human race. 

The room was dark, and the atmosphere 
heavy, as has been said. Creatures accustomed 
to freedom and to fresh air gasped the night 
away. The large place was lined with cages, 
each occupied by its little prisoner. The in- 
oculated victims were many — rabbits, guinea 
pigs, and the like — all vicariously, and for 
the most part uselessly, enduring for the va- 
garies of science the maladies of man. Sights 
which the readers of these pages could not 
bring their delicate sensibilities to witness, 
facts which you who follow this narrative 
would not permit its writer to relate, crowded 
that den of anguish. 



 

Those four walls, packed with suffering I, 
kept their secrets well. Into this tragic place 
no curious reporter was admitted ; from it the 
omnipotence of the press was excluded ; into 
this pit no sister of mercy stepped ; to these 
wounded no hospital nurse brought the ministrations 
of her gentle art ; into this lair no 
preacher entered, and, leaving it, challenged 
Christian civilization with its existence ; into 
this hell no Christ descended. 

It was well after midnight when a slight 
disturbance occurred in the animal room. A 
newcomer, who had not yet been operated 
upon, and who was not caged, but tied, awoke 
whining. Restless calls of response echoed 
throughout the large room. The little white 
dog that had caused the trouble pulled franti- 
cally at its rope, and in its most pathetic way 
called for its master. A low reply came from 
an adjoining cage, and a black muzzle pressed 
itself against the netting. The white poodle 
returned a few sympathetic remarks, and the 
two carried on a short conversation. The 
debutante in that sad society, who though 
sometimes leashed, was not, until her recent 



 

unhappy experience, accustomed to be tied, 
resented her captivity with intolerable aston- 
ishment. She pulled and pulled again at the 
stout rope, and then, yielding to the stifling 
closeness of the room, stopped, panting and 
exhausted. Low whines from the black spaniel 
in the nearest cage greeted this failure. 

Most dogs, even the most intelligent and 
the best educated, are numbed by despair 
when they are lost. Their very powers of 
thought or recognition are affected by the su- 
preme catastrophe. For two weeks the French 
poodle had been bewildered by the agony of 
homesickness. Torn from its master, from its 
home, from its occupation, it had fallen into 
a lethargy that had dispossessed it of its nat- 
ural reason. Now, after the last desperate 
and futile attempt to break or gnaw the rope, 
the baffled creature had cast itself upon the 
floor. In that moment of exhaustion, memory 
flooded its brain. With a bound the dog 
leaped to its feet. It uttered a short, piercing 
bark of triumph. Suddenly Trixy had found 
herself. 

It now occurred to her for the first time 
that, no matter what might be the case with 



 

more ignorant dogs, it was quite unnecessary 
for her to remain a prisoner. She could slip 
her collar, as she had done scores of times 
before. She bent her head down, put her 
paws up to her neck, and with a wriggle or 
two, deftly drew the collar over her ears. 
Contemptuously she picked it up and tossed 
it away. Trixy's intellect, although close on 
the keenest order known to her race, paused 
on the hither side of the facts that an attempt 
had been made to remove the plate from her 
collar, and that, this having failed, the name 
of her master had been scratched into partial 
illegibility. 

The little actress now had the freedom of 
the room. The first use that she made of it 
was to examine its occupants, her companions 
in misfortune. She addressed herself at the 
outset to her neighbor, the black spaniel ; but 
he, for some reason which was beyond Trixy's 
power to fathom, responded only by feeble 
moans. Hoping to find some more sociable
