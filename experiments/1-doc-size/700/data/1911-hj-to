eagerness had spared her reserve; she flung over the “ground” that his
question laid bare the light veil of an evasion, “‘Great people,’ I’ve
learned to see, mustn’t--to remain great--do what my father’s doing.”

“It’s indeed on the theory of their not so behaving,” Hugh returned,
“that we see them--all the inferior rest of us--in the grand glamour of
their greatness!”

If he had spoken to meet her admirable frankness half-way, that beauty
in her almost brushed him aside to make at a single step the rest of the
journey. “You won’t see them in it for long--if they don’t now, under
such tests and with such opportunities, begin to take care.”

This had given him, at a stroke, he clearly felt, all freedom for the
closer criticism. “Lord Theign perhaps recognises some such canny truth,
but ‘takes care,’ with the least trouble to himself and the finest short
cut--does it, if you’ll let me say so, rather on the cheap--by finding
‘the likes’ of me, as his daughter’s trusted friend, out of the
question.”

“Well, you won’t mind that, will you?” Lady Grace asked, “if he finds
his daughter herself, in any such relation to you, quite as much so.”

“Different enough, from position to position and person to person,” he
brightly brooded, “is the view that gets itself most comfortably taken
of the implications of Honour!”

“Yes,” the girl returned; “my father, in the act of despoiling us
all, all who are interested, without apparently the least unpleasant
consciousness, keeps the balance showily even, to his mostly so fine,
so delicate sense, by suddenly discovering that he’s scandalised at my
caring for your friendship.”

Hugh looked at her, on this, as with the gladness verily of possession
promised and only waiting--or as if from that moment forth he had her
assurance of everything that most concerned him and that might
most inspire. “Well, isn’t the moral of it all simply that what his
perversity of pride, as we can only hold it, will have most done for us
is to bring us--and to keep us--blessedly together?”

She seemed for a moment to question his “simply.” “Do you regard us as
so much ‘together’ when you remember where, in spite of everything, I’ve
put myself?”

“By telling him to do what he likes?” he recalled without embarrassment.
“Oh, that wasn’t in spite of ‘everything’--it was only in spite of the
Manto-vano.”

“‘Only’?” she flushed--“when I’ve given the picture up?”

“Ah,” Hugh cried, “I don’t care a hang for the picture!” And then as she
let him, closer, close to her with this, possess himself of her hands:
“We both only care, don’t we, that we’re given to each other thus? We
both only care, don’t we, that nothing can keep us apart?”

“Oh, if you’ve forgiven me--!” she sighed into his fond face.

“Why, since you gave the thing up for me,” he pleadingly laughed, “it
isn’t as if you had given me up----!”

“For anything, anything? Ah never, never!” she breathed.

“Then why aren’t we all right?”

“Well, if you will----!”

“Oh for ever and ever and ever!”--and with this ardent cry of his
devotion his arms closed in their strength and she was clasped to his
breast and to his lips.

The next moment, however, she had checked him with the warning “Amy
Sandgate!”--as if she had heard their hostess enter the other room. Lady
Sand-gate was in fact almost already upon them--their disjunction had
scarce been effected and she had reached the nearer threshold. They
had at once put the widest space possible between them--a little of
the flurry of which transaction agitated doubtless their clutch at
composure. They gave back a shade awkwardly and consciously, on one side
and the other, the speculative though gracious attention she for a few
moments made them and their recent intimate relation the subject of;
from all of which indeed Lady Grace sought and found cover in a prompt
and responsible address to Hugh. “Mustn’t you go without more delay to
Clifford Street?”

He came back to it all alert “At once!” He had recovered his hat and
reached the other door, whence he gesticulated farewell to the elder
lady. “Please pardon me”--and he disappeared.

Lady Sandgate hereupon stood for a little silently confronted with the
girl. “Have you freedom of mind for the fact that your father’s suddenly
at hand?”

“He has come back?”--Lady Grace was sharply struck.

“He arrives this afternoon and appears to go straight to
Kitty--according to a wire that I find downstairs on coming back
late from my luncheon. He has returned with a rush--as,” said his
correspondent in the elation of triumph, “I was sure he would!”

Her young friend was more at sea. “Brought back, you mean, by the
outcry--even though he so hates it?”

But she was more and more all lucidity--save in so far as she was now
almost all authority. “Ah, hating still more to seem afraid, he has come
back to face the music!”

Lady Grace, turning away as in vague despair for the manner in which
the music might affect him, yet wheeled about again, after thought, to
a positive recognition and even to quite an inconsequent pride.
“Yes--that’s dear old father!”

And what was Lady Sandgate moreover but mistress now of the subject?
“At the point the row has reached he couldn’t stand it another day; so
he has thrown up his cure and--lest we should oppose him!--not even
announced his start.”

“Well,” her companion returned, “now that I’ve done it all I shall
never oppose him again!”

Lady Sandgate appeared to show herself as still under the impression she
might have received on entering. “He’ll only oppose you!”

“If he does,” said Lady Grace, “we’re at present two to bear it.”

“Heaven save us then”--the elder woman was quick, was even cordial, for
the sense of this--“your good friend is clever!”

Lady Grace honoured the remark. “Mr. Crim-ble’s remarkably clever.”

“And you’ve arranged----?”

“We haven’t arranged--but we’ve understood. So that, dear Amy, if you
understand--!” Lady Grace paused, for Gotch had come in from the hall.

“His lordship has arrived?” his mistress immediately put to him.

“No, my lady, but Lord John has--to know if he’s expected here, and in
that case, by your ladyship’s leave, to come up.”

Her ladyship turned to the girl. “May Lord John--as we do await your
father--come up?”

“As suits you, please!”

“He may come up,” said Lady Sandgate to Gotch. “His lordship’s
expected.” She had a pause till they were alone again, when she went
on to her companion: “You asked me just now if I understood. Well--I do
understand!”

Lady Grace, with Gotch’s withdrawal, which left the door open, had
reached the passage to the other room. “Then you’ll excuse me!”--she
made her escape.




II

Lord John, reannounced the next instant from the nearest quarter and
quite waiving salutations, left no doubt of the high pitch of his
eagerness and tension as soon as the door had closed behind him. “What
on earth then do you suppose he has come back to do--?” To which he
added while his hostess’s gesture impatiently disclaimed conjecture:
“Because when a fellow really finds himself the centre of a
cyclone----!”

“Isn’t it just at the centre,” she interrupted, “that you keep
remarkably still, and only in the suburbs that you feel the rage? I
count on dear Theign’s doing nothing in the least foolish--!”

“Ah, but he can’t have chucked everything for nothing,” Lord John
sharply returned; “and wherever you place him in the rumpus he can’t
not meet somehow, hang it, such an assault on his character as a great
nobleman and good citizen.”

“It’s his luck to have become with the public of the newspapers the
scapegoat-in-chief: for the sins, so-called, of a lot of people!” Lady
Sandgate inconclusively sighed.

“Yes,” Lord John concluded for her, “the mercenary millions on whose
traffic in their trumpery values--when they’re so lucky as to have
any!--this isn’t a patch!”

“Oh, there are cases and cases: situations and responsibilities so
intensely differ!”--that appeared on the whole, for her ladyship, the
moral to be gathered.

“Of course everything differs, all round, from everything,” Lord John
went on; “and who in the world knows anything of his own case but the
victim of circumstances exposing himself, for the highest and purest
motives, to be literally torn to pieces?”

“Well,” said Lady Sandgate as, in her strained suspense, she freshly
consulted her bracelet watch, “I hope he isn’t already torn--if you tell
me you’ve been to Kitty’s.”

“Oh, he was all right so far: he had arrived and gone out again,” the
young man explained, “as Lady Imber hadn’t been at home.”

“Ah cool Kitty!” his hostess sighed again--but diverted, as she spoke,
by the reappearance of her butler, this time positively preceding Lord
Theign, whom she met, when he presently stood before her, his garb
of travel exchanged for consummate afternoon dress, with yearning
tenderness and compassionate curiosity. “At last, dearest friend--what a
joy! But with Kitty not at home to receive you?”

That young woman’s parent made light of it for the indulged creature’s
sake. “Oh I knew my Kitty! I dressed and I find her at five-thirty.”
 To which he added as he only took in further, without expression, Lord
John: “But Bender, who came there before my arrival--he hasn’t tried for
me here?”

It was a point on which Lord John himself could at least be expressive.
“I met him at the club at luncheon; he had had your letter--but for
which chance, my dear man, I should have known nothing. You’ll see him
all right at this house; but I’m glad, if I may say so, Theign,” the
speaker pursued with some emphasis--“I’m glad, you know, to get hold of
you first.”

Lord Theign seemed about to ask for the meaning of this remark, but his
other companion’s apprehension had already overflowed. “You haven’t come
back, have you--to whatever it may be!--for trouble of any sort with
Breckenridge?”

His lordship transferred his penetration to this fair friend, “Have
you become so intensely absorbed--these remarkable days!--in
‘Breckenridge’?”

She felt the shadow, you would have seen, of his claimed right, or at
least privilege, of search--yet easily, after an instant, emerged clear.
“I’ve thought and dreamt but of you--suspicious man!--in proportion as
the clamour has spread; and Mr. Bender meanwhile, if you want to know,
hasn’t been near me once!”

Lord John came in a manner, and however unconsciously, to her aid.
“You’d have seen, if he had been, what’s the matter with him, I
think--and what perhaps Theign has seen from his own letter: since,” he
went on to his fellow-visitor, “I understood him a week ago to have been
much taken up with writing you.”

Lord Theign received this without comment, only again with an air of
expertly sounding the speaker; after which he gave himself afresh for
a moment to Lady Sandgate. “I’ve not come home for any clamour, as you
surely know me well enough to believe; or to notice for a minute the
cheapest insolence and aggression--which frankly scarce reached me out
there; or which, so far as it did, I was daily washed clean of by those
blest waters. I returned on Mr. Bender’s letter,” he then vouchsafed
to Lord John--“three extraordinarily vulgar pages about the egregious
Pap-pendick!”

“About his having suddenly turned up in person, yes, and, as
Breckenridge says, marked the picture down?”--the young man was clearly
all-knowing. “That has of course weighed on Bender--being confirmed
apparently, on the whole, by the drift of public opinion.”

Lord Theign took, on this, with a frank show of reaction from some of
his friend’s terms, a sharp turn off; he even ironically indicated the
babbler or at least the blunderer in question to Lady Sandgate. “He too
has known me so long, and he comes here to talk to me of ‘the drift of
public opinion’!” After which he quite charged at his vain informant.
“Am I to tell you again that I snap my fingers at the drift of public
opinion?--which is but another name for the chatter of all the fools one
doesn’t know, in addition to all those (and plenty of ‘em!) one damnably
does.”

Lady Sandgate, by a turn of the hand, dropped oil from her golden cruse.
“Ah, you did that, in your own grand way, before you went abroad!”

“I don’t speak of the matter, my dear man, in the light of its effect on
you,” Lord John importantly explained--“but in the light of its effect
on Bender; who so consumedly wants the picture, if he is to have it,
to be a Mantovano, but seems unable to get it taken at last for anything
but the fine old Moretto that of course it has always been.”

Lord Theign, in growing disgust at the whole beastly complication,
betrayed more and more the odd pitch of the temper that had abruptly
restored him with such incalculable weight to the scene of action.
“Well, isn’t a fine old Moretto good enough for him; confound him?”

It pulled up not a little Lord John, who yet made his point. “A fine old
Moretto, you know, was exactly what he declined at Dedborough--for its
comparative, strictly comparative, insignificance; and he only thought
of the picture when the wind began to rise for the enormous rarity--”

“That that mendacious young cad who has bamboozled Grace,” Lord Theign
broke in, “tried to befool us, for his beggarly reasons, into claiming
for it?”

Lady Sandgate renewed her mild influence. “Ah, the knowing people
haven’t had their last word--the possible Mantovano isn’t exploded
yet!” Her noble friend, however, declined the offered spell. “I’ve
had enough of the knowing people--the knowing people are serpents! My
picture’s to take or to leave--and it’s what I’ve come back, if you
please, John, to say to your man to his face.”

This declaration had a report as sharp and almost as multiplied as the
successive cracks of a discharged revolver; yet when the light smoke
cleared Lady Sand-gate at least was still left standing and smiling.
“Yes, why in mercy’s name can’t he choose which?--and why does he
write him, dreadful Breckenridge, such tiresome argumentative letters?”

Lord John took up her idea as with the air of something that had been
working in him rather vehemently, though under due caution too, as a
consequence of this exchange, during which he had apprehensively watched
his elder. “I don’t think I quite see how, my dear Theign, the poor
chap’s letter was so offensive.”

In that case his dear Theign could tell him. “Because it was a tissue
of expressions that may pass current--over counters and in awful
newspapers--in his extraordinary world or country, but that I decline
to take time to puzzle out here.”

“If he didn’t make himself understood,” Lord John took leave to laugh,
“it must indeed have been an unusual production for Bender.”

“Oh, I often, with the wild beauty, if you will, of so many of his
turns, haven’t a notion,” Lady Sandgate confessed with an equal gaiety,
“of what he’s talking about.”

“I think I never miss his weird sense,” her younger guest again loyally
contended--“and in fact as a general thing I rather like it!”

“I happen to like nothing that I don’t enjoy,” Lord Theign rejoined with
some asperity--“and so far as I do follow the fellow he assumes on my
part an interest in his expenditure of purchase-money that I neither
feel nor pretend to. He doesn’t want--by what I spell out--the picture
he refused at Dedborough; he may possibly want--if one reads it so--the
picture on view in Bond Street; and he yet appears to make, with great
emphasis, the stupid ambiguous point that these two ‘articles’ (the
greatest of Morettos an ‘article’!) haven’t been ‘by now’ proved
different: as if I engaged with him that I myself would so prove them!”

Lord John indulged in a pause--but also in a suggestion. “He must
allude to your hoping--when you allowed us to place the picture with
Mackintosh--that it would show to all London in the most precious light
conceivable.”

“Well, if it hasn’t so shown”--and Lord Theign stared as if
mystified--“what in the world’s the meaning of this preposterous
racket?”

“The racket is largely,” his young friend explained, “the vociferation
of the people who contradict each other about it.”

On which their hostess sought to enliven the gravity of the question.
“Some--yes--shouting on the housetops that’s a Mantovano of the
Mantovanos, and others shrieking back at them that they’re donkeys if
not criminals.”

“He may take it for whatever he likes,” said Lord Theign, heedless of
these contributions, “he may father it on Michael Angelo himself if
he’ll but clear out with it and let me alone!”

“What he’d like to take it for,” Lord John at this point saw his way
to remark, “is something in the nature of a Hundred Thousand.”

“A Hundred Thousand?” cried his astonished friend.

“Quite, I dare say, a Hundred Thousand”--the young man enjoyed clearly
handling even by the lips so round a sum.

Lady Sandgate disclaimed however with agility any appearance of having
gaped. “Why, haven’t you yet realised, Theign, that those are the
American figures?”

His lordship looked at her fixedly and then did the same by Lord John,
after which he waited a little. “I’ve nothing to do with the American
figures--which seem to me, if you press me, you know, quite intolerably
vulgar.”

“Well, I’d be as vulgar as anybody for a Hundred Thousand!” Lady
Sandgate hastened to proclaim.

“Didn’t he let us know at Dedborough,” Lord John asked of the master of
that seat, “that he had no use, as he said, for lower values?”

“I’ve heard him remark myself,” said their companion, rising to the
monstrous memory, “that he wouldn’t take a cheap picture--even though a
‘handsome’ one--as a present.”

“And does he call the thing round the corner a cheap picture?” the
proprietor of the work demanded.

Lord John threw up his arms with a grin of impatience. “All he wants to
do, don’t you see? is to prevent your making it one!”

Lord Theign glared at this imputation to him of a low ductility. “I
offered the thing, as it was, at an estimate worthy of it--and of me.”

“My dear reckless friend,” his young adviser protested, “you named no
figure at all when it came to the point----!”

“It didn’t come to the point! Nothing came to the point but that I put
a Moretto on view; as a thing, yes, perfectly”--Lord Theign accepted the
reminding gesture--“on which a rich American had an eye and in which he
had, so to speak, an interest. That was what I wanted, and so we left
it--parting each of us ready but neither of us bound.”

“Ah, Mr. Bender’s bound, as he’d say,” Lady Sand-gate
interposed--“‘bound’ to make you swallow the enormous luscious plum that
your appetite so morbidly rejects!”

“My appetite, as morbid as you like”--her old friend had shrewdly turned
on her--“is my own affair, and if the fellow must deal in enormities I
warn him to carry them elsewhere!”

Lord John, plainly, by this time, was quite exasperated at the absurdity
of him. “But how can’t you see that it’s only a plum, as she says, for
a plum and an eye for an eye--since the picture itself, with this huge
ventilation, is now quite a different affair?”

“How the deuce a different affair when just what the man himself
confesses is that, in spite of all the chatter of the prigs and pedants,
there’s no really established ground for treating it as anything but
the same?” On which, as having so unanswerably spoken, Lord Theign shook
himself free again, in his high petulance, and moved restlessly to where
the passage to the other room appeared to offer his nerves an issue; all
moreover to the effect of suggesting to us that something still other
than what he had said might meanwhile work in him behind and beneath
that quantity. The spectators of his trouble watched him, for the time,
in uncertainty and with a mute but associated comment on the perversity
and oddity he had so suddenly developed; Lord John giving a shrug of
almost bored despair and Lady Sandgate signalling caution and tact for
their action by a finger flourished to her lips, and in fact at once
proceeding to apply these arts. The subject of her attention had still
remained as in worried thought; he had even mechanically taken up a book
from a table--which he then, after an absent glance at it, tossed down.

“You’re so detached from reality, you adorable dreamer,” she began--“and
unless you stick to that you might as well have done nothing. What
you call the pedantry and priggishness and all the rest of it is exactly
what poor Breckenridge asked almost on his knees, wonderful man, to
be allowed to pay you for; since even if the meddlers and chatterers
haven’t settled anything for those who know--though which of the elect
themselves after all does seem to know?--it’s a great service rendered
him to have started such a hare to run!”

Lord John took freedom to throw off very much the same idea. “Certainly
his connection with the whole question and agitation makes no end for
his glory.”

It didn’t, that remark, bring their friend back to him, but it at least
made his indifference flash with derision. “His ‘glory’--Mr. Bender’s
glory? Why, they quite universally loathe him--judging by the stuff they
print!”

“Oh, here--as a corrupter of our morals and a promoter of our decay,
even though so many are flat on their faces to him--yes! But it’s
another affair over there where the eagle screams like a thousand
steam-whistles and the newspapers flap like the leaves of the forest:
there he’ll be, if you’ll only let him, the biggest thing going; since
sound, in that air, seems to mean size, and size to be all that counts.
If he said of the thing, as you recognise,” Lord John went on, “‘It’s
going to be a Mantovano,’ why you can bet your life that it is--that
it has got to be some kind of a one.”

His fellow-guest, at this, drew nearer again, irritated, you would
have been sure, by the unconscious infelicity of the pair--worked up
to something quite openly wilful and passionate. “No kind of a furious
flaunting one, under my patronage, that I can prevent, my boy! The
Dedborough picture in the market--owing to horrid little circumstances
that regard myself alone--is the Dedborough picture at a decent,
sufficient, civilised Dedborough price, and nothing else whatever; which
I beg you will take as my last word on the subject.”

Lord John, trying whether he could take it, momentarily mingled his
hushed state with that of their hostess, to whom he addressed a helpless
look; after which, however, he appeared to find that he could only
reassert himself. “May I nevertheless reply that I think you’ll not be
able to prevent anything?--since the discussed object will completely
escape your control in New York!”

“And almost any discussed object”--Lady Sand-gate rose to the occasion
also--“is in New York, by what one hears, easily worth a Hundred
Thousand!”

Lord Theign looked from one of them to the other. “I sell the man a
Hundred Thousand worth of swagger and advertisement; and of fraudulent
swagger and objectionable advertisement at that?”

“Well”--Lord John was but briefly baffled--“when the picture’s his you
can’t help its doing what it can and what it will for him anywhere!”

“Then it isn’t his yet,” the elder man retorted--“and I promise you
never will be if he has sent you to me with his big drum!”

Lady Sandgate turned sadly on this to her associate in patience, as
if the case were now really beyond them. “Yes, how indeed can it ever
become his if Theign simply won’t let him pay for it?”

Her question was unanswerable. “It’s the first time in all my life I’ve
known a man feel insulted, in such a piece of business, by happening
not to be, in the usual way, more or less swindled!”

“Theign is unable to take it in,” her ladyship explained, “that--as I’ve
heard it said of all these money-monsters of the new type--Bender simply
can’t afford not to be cited and celebrated as the biggest buyer who
ever lived.”

“Ah, cited and celebrated at my expense--say it at once and have it
over, that I may enjoy what you all want to do to me!”

“The dear man’s inimitable--at his ‘expense’!” It was more than Lord
John could bear as he fairly flung himself off in his derisive impotence
and addressed his wail to Lady Sandgate.

“Yes, at my expense is exactly what I mean,” Lord Theign
asseverated--“at the expense of my modest claim to regulate my behaviour
by my own standards. There you perfectly are about the man, and it’s
precisely what I say--that he’s to hustle and harry me because he’s a
money-monster: which I never for a moment dreamed of, please understand,
when I let you, John, thrust him at me as a pecuniary resource at
Dedborough. I didn’t put my property on view that he might blow about
it------!”

“No, if you like it,” Lady Sandgate returned; “but you certainly didn’t
so arrange”--she seemed to think her point somehow would help--“that
you might blow about it yourself!”

“Nobody wants to ‘blow,’” Lord John more stoutly interposed, “either hot
or cold, I take it; but I really don’t see the harm of Bender’s liking
to be known for the scale of his transactions--actual or merely imputed
even, if you will; since that scale is really so magnificent.”

Lady Sandgate half accepted, half qualified this plea. “The only
question perhaps is why he doesn’t try for some precious work that
somebody--less delicious than dear Theign--can be persuaded on bended
knees to accept a hundred thousand for.”

“‘Try’ for one?”--her younger visitor took it up while her elder more
attentively watched him. “That was exactly what he did try for when he
pressed you so hard in vain for the great Sir Joshua.”

“Oh well, he mustn’t come back to that--must he, Theign?” her ladyship
cooed.

That personage failed to reply, so that Lord John went on, unconscious
apparently of the still more suspicious study to which he exposed
himself. “Besides which there are no things of that magnitude knocking
about, don’t you know?--they’ve got to be worked up first if they’re
to reach the grand publicity of the Figure! Would you mind,” he
continued to his noble monitor, “an agreement on some such basis as
this?--that you shall resign yourself to the biggest equivalent you’ll
squeamishly consent to take, if it’s at the same time the smallest he’ll
squeamishly consent to offer; but that, that done, you shall leave him
free----”

Lady Sandgate took it up straight, rounding it off, as their companion
only waited. “Leave him free to talk about the sum offered and the sum
taken as practically one and the same?”

“Ah, you know,” Lord John discriminated, “he doesn’t ‘talk’ so much
himself--there’s really nothing blatant or crude about poor Bender. It’s
the rate at which--by the very way he’s ‘fixed’: an awful way indeed, I
grant you!--a perfect army of reporter-wretches, close at his heels, are
always talking for him and of him.”

Lord Theign spoke hereupon at last with the air as of an impulse that
had been slowly gathering force. “You talk for him, my dear chap,
pretty well. You urge his case, my honour, quite as if you were assured
of a commission on the job--on a fine ascending scale! Has he put you
up to that proposition, eh? Do you get a handsome percentage and are
you to make a good thing of it?”

The young man coloured under this stinging pleasantry--whether from a
good conscience affronted or from a bad one made worse; but he otherwise
showed a bold front, only bending his eyes a moment on his watch.
“As he’s to come to you himself--and I don’t know why the mischief he
doesn’t come!--he will answer you that graceful question.”

“Will he answer it,” Lord Theign asked, “with the veracity that
the suggestion you’ve just made on his behalf represents him as so
beautifully adhering to?” On which he again quite fiercely turned his
back and recovered his detachment, the others giving way behind him to a
blanker dismay.

Lord John, in spite of this however, pumped up a tone. “I don’t see why
you should speak as if I were urging some abomination.”

“Then I’ll tell you why!”--and Lord Theign was upon him again for the
purpose. “Because I had rather give the cursed thing away outright and
for good and all than that it should hang out there another day in the
interest of such equivocations!”

Lady Sandgate’s dismay yielded to her wonder, and her wonder apparently
in turn to her amusement. “‘Give it away,’ my dear friend, to a man who
only longs to smother you in gold?”

Her dear friend, however, had lost patience with her levity. “Give it
away--just for a luxury of protest and a stoppage of chatter--to some
cause as unlike as possible that of Mr. Bender’s power of sound and
his splendid reputation: to the Public, to the Authorities, to the
Thingumbob, to the Nation!”

Lady Sandgate broke into horror while Lord John stood sombre and
stupefied. “Ah, my dear creature, you’ve flights of extravagance----!”

“One thing’s very certain,” Lord Theign quite heedlessly pursued--“that
the thought of my property on view there does give intolerably on my
nerves, more and more every minute that I’m conscious of it; so that,
hang it, if one thinks of it, why shouldn’t I, for my relief, do again,
damme, what I like?--that is bang the door in their faces, have the
show immediately stopped?” He turned with the attraction of this idea
from one of his listeners to the other. “It’s my show--it isn’t
Bender’s, surely!--and I can do just as I choose with it.”

“Ah, but isn’t that the very point?”--and Lady Sandgate put it to Lord
John. “Isn’t it Bender’s show much more than his?”

Her invoked authority, however, in answer to this, made but a motion of
disappointment and disgust at so much rank folly--while Lord Theign, on
the other hand, followed up his happy thought. “Then if it’s Bender’s
show, or if he claims it is, there’s all the more reason!” And it took
his lordship’s inspiration no longer to flower. “See here, John--do
this: go right round there this moment, please, and tell them from me to
shut straight down!”

“‘Shut straight down’?” the young man abhorrently echoed.

“Stop it to-night--wind it up and end it: see?” The more the
entertainer of that vision held it there the more charm it clearly
took on for him. “Have the picture removed from view and the incident
closed.”

“You seriously ask that of me!” poor Lord John quavered.

“Why in the world shouldn’t I? It’s a jolly lot less than you asked of
me a month ago at Dedborough.”

“What then am I to say to them?” Lord John spoke but after a long
moment, during which he had only looked hard and--an observer might even
then have felt--ominously at his taskmaster.

That personage replied as if wholly to have done with the matter. “Say
anything that comes into your clever head. I don’t really see that
there’s anything else for you!” Lady Sandgate sighed to the messenger,
who gave no sign save of positive stiffness.

The latter seemed still to weigh his displeasing obligation; then
he eyed his friend significantly--almost portentously. “Those are
absolutely your sentiments?”

“Those are absolutely my sentiments”--and Lord Theign brought this out
as with the force of a physical push.

“Very well then!” But the young man, indulging in a final, a fairly
sinister, study of such a dealer in the arbitrary, made sure of the
extent, whatever it was, of his own wrong. “Not one more day?”

Lord Theign only waved him away. “Not one more hour!”

He paused at the door, this reluctant spokesman, as if for some supreme
protest; but after another prolonged and decisive engagement with the
two pairs of eyes that waited, though differently, on his performance,
he clapped on his hat as in the rage of his resentment and departed on
his mission.

“He can’t bear to do it, poor man!” Lady Sand-gate ruefully remarked to
her remaining guest after Lord John had, under extreme pressure, dashed
out to Bond Street.

“I dare say not!”--Lord Theign, flushed with the felicity of
self-expression, made little of that. “But he goes too far, you see,
and it clears the air--pouah! Now therefore”--and he glanced at the
clock--“I must go to Kitty.”

“Kitty--with what Kitty wants,” Lady Sandgate opined--“won’t thank you
for that!”

“She never thanks me for anything”--and the fact of his resignation
clearly added here to his bitterness. “So it’s no great loss!”

“Won’t you at any rate,” his hostess asked, “wait for Bender?”

His lordship cast it to the winds. “What have I to do with him now?”

“Why surely if he’ll accept your own price--!”

Lord Theign thought--he wondered; and then as if fairly amused at
himself: “Hanged if I know what is my own price!” After which he went
for his hat. “But there’s one thing,” he remembered as he came back with
it: “where’s my too, too unnatural daughter?”

“If you mean Grace and really want her I’ll send and find out.”

“Not now”--he bethought himself. “But does she see that chatterbox?”

“Mr. Crimble? Yes, she sees him.”

He kept his eyes on her. “Then how far has it gone?”

Lady Sandgate overcame an embarrassment. “Well, not even yet, I think,
so far as they’d like.”

“They’d ‘like’--heaven save the mark!--to marry?”
