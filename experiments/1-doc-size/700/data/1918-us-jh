she wailed; and Jimmie answered: Whose business was it to 
bother about working-class babies, under the hellish capitalist 
system ? 



So Jimmie had his way for a bit he went into Leesville 
and helped distribute literature, and held the torch at street- 
meetings, where some people hooted at them and others defended 
them, and the police had to interfere to prevent a riot. It was at 
this time that a militant majority was trying to drive through 
the Senate a declaration of war against Germany, and a hand- 
ful of pacifists blocked the way in the closing hours of the 
session, thus causing a delay of several weeks. How you re- 
garded this action depended upon your point of view. The 
President denounced them as "wilful men," and the Wall Street 
newspapers apparently wanted them lynched; whereas Jimmie 
and his fellows in the local hailed them as heroes and friends 
of mankind. The Socialists argued that the President had 
been re-elected, only four months before, by pacifist votes, and 
upon a pacifist platform ; and now he was sweeping the country 
into war, and denouncing those who stood upon his former 
convictions ! 

On top of this came another event which set Jimmie almost 
beside himself with excitement. For three days all news from 
Petrograd was cut off; and then came a report, electrifying 
the world the Tsar had been overthrown, the Russian people 
were free ! Jimmie could hardly believe his eyes ; he went in 
to the meeting of the local three nights later, to find the com- 
rades celebrating as if the world were theirs. Here was the 
thing they had been preaching, day in and day out, all these 
weary years, amid ridicule, hatred and persecution; here waa 





the Social Revolution, knocking at the gates of the world! It 
would spread to Austria and Germany, to Italy, France, Eng- 
land and so to Leesville ! Everywhere the people would come 
into their own, and war and tyranny would vanish like a hate- 
ful nightmare! 

Speaker after speaker got up to proclaim this glorious future ; 
they sang the Marseillaise and the Internationale, and the 
Russians who were present clasped one another in their arms, 
with tears running down their cheeks. It was voted that they 
must hold a mass-meeting immediately, to explain this epoch- 
making event to the people of the city; also they must stand 
more firmly than ever by their programme of opposition to 
war. Now, with Social Revolution knocking at the gates of 
the world, what was the use of America's going in for militarism ? 

So Jimmie set to work with redoubled fervour, giving all 
his time to agitation. He had apparently no chance of getting 
a job, and for the moment he gave up trying. The keeper of 
the cross-roads store, being down on Him because of his ideas, 
refused him any more credit; and so poor Lizzie was driven to 
do what she had vowed never to do take off the stocking from 
her right leg, and unsew the bandage from her ankle, and 
extract one of the ten precious twenty dollar bills. Their 
bright yellow was considerably faded now, their beautiful crisp- 
ness gone entirely; but the store-keeper made no kick on that 
account he returned the change, and incidentally took occasion 
to give her a friendly warning concerning her husband's reck- 
less talk. There was trouble coming to him, and his wife had 
better shut him up before it was too late. So poor Lizzie ceased 
being a pacifist, and went home to have more hysterics on her 
husband's bosom. 


Being unable to hold him back, she sent word by the mail- 
carrier to old Peter Drew to come up and help ; the old farmer 
hitched up his bony mare and drove to see them, and for a 
couple of hours talked America while Jimmie talked Rus- 
sia. Was America to lie down before the Kaiser? Jimmie 
would answer that they were going to bring down the Kaiser 
in the same way they had brought down the Tsar. The 
workers of Russia having shown the way, nevermore would the 
workers of any nation bow to the yoke of slavery. Yes, even 



 

in the so-called republics, such as France, which was ruled by 
bankers, and America, which was ruled by Wall Street even 
here, the workers would read the lesson of revolt ! 

"But in America the people can get anything they want,"

cried the bewildered old man. "They only have to vote " 

"Vote?" snarled Jimmie. "An' have their votes thrown out 
by some rotten political gang, like they got here in Leesville? 
Don't talk to me about votin' they told me I'd moved into a 
new district an' lost my vote lost it because I lost my job ! 
So it's old man Granitch has the say whether I can vote or 
not! You'll find the same thing true of two-thirds of the 
men in the Empire Shops half the unskilled men in the coun- 
try got no votes, because they got no home, no nothinV 

"But," argued the old soldier, "how will you run your new 
working-class government, if not by votes?" 

"Sure, we'll run it by votes," Jimmie answered "but first 
we'll turn out the capitalists; they won't have the money to 
buy political machines ; they won't own the newspapers an' print 
lies about us. Look at this Leesville 'Herald' right now just 
plain downright lies they print we can't get any truth at all 
to the people." 

And so it went. It was of no use for the old man to plead 
for the "country"; to Jimmie the "country" had let itself be 
lost, suppressed, taken over by the capitalists, the "plutes." 
Jimmie's sense of loyalty was not to his country, but to his 
class, which had been exploited, hounded, driven from pillar 
to post. In past times the government had allowed itself to 
be used by corporations; so now it was in vain that the Presi- 
dent made appeals for justice and democracy, using the beautiful 
language of idealism. Jimmie did not believe that he meant 
it; or anyhow, Wall Street would see that nothing came of 
his promises. The "plutes" would take his words and twist 
them into whatever sense they wished ; and meantime they went 
on pouring out abuse on Jimmie Higgins throwing the same 
old mud into his eyes, blinding him with the same old hatred. 
So there was no way for an old soldier and patriot to break 
through the armour of Jimmie's prejudice. 

IV 

Next day was to be the great mass-meeting in celebration of 
the Eussian revolution; and would you believe it, Lizzie was 





hoping to persuade Jimmie to stay away; she had brought Mr. 
Drew to help persuade him ! Poor Lizzie had visions of every- 
body in the hall being carted off to jail, of Jimmie getting up 
and shouting something, causing the police to fall on him and 
beat in his skull with their clubs. It was in vain he declared 
that he was going to do nothing more romantic than sell litera- 
ture and act as usher. She clasped him in her arms, weeping 
copiously, and when he was still obdurate, she declared that 
she would go with him. She would try to persuade Mrs. Drew 
to take care of the babies for one night. 

Old Peter Drew answered that he would be interested to 
attend the meeting himself. How would it do for him to come 
for Lizzie and the little ones, and leave the latter at his home, 
and then drive with Lizzie to the meeting? They could meet 
Jimmie at the Opera-house, where he would be spending the 
day decorating. Then after the meeting they could all drive 
back together. Fine! said Jimmie, who had visions of the 
old soldier becoming infected with revolutionary fever. 

But alas, it did not work out that way. To Jimmie's con- 
sternation the old man turned up at the Opera-house in a faded 
blue uniform with brass buttons all over it ! Everybody stared, 
of course; and they stared all the harder because they saw this 
military personage in company with Comrade Higgins. The 
old boy gazed about at the swarms of people, many of them 
with red buttons, the women with red ribbons or sashes; he 
gazed at the decorations the huge flag and the long red stream- 
ers, the banner of the Karl Marx Yerein, and the banner of the 
Ypsels, or Young Peoples' Socialist League of Leesville, and 
the banner of the Machinists' Union, Local 4717, and of the 
Carpenters' Union, District 529, and of the Workers' Co-opera- 
tive Society. He turned to Jimmie and said, "Where's the 
American flag?" 

The Liederkranz sang the Marseillaise, and after the audi- 
ence had cheered and waved red handkerchiefs and shouted 
itself hoarse, Comrade Gerrity, the chairman, made a little 
speech. For many years all Socialists had been accustomed to 
employ a metaphor by which to describe conditions in their 
country, and now they would no longer be able to use it, for 
Eussia was free, and America would follow her example when 
she had the sense. He introduced Comrade Pavel Michaelo- 
vitch, who had come all the way from New York to tell them 



 

the meaning of the greatest event of history. Comrade Pavel, 
a slender, frail, scholarly-looking man with a black beard and 
black-rimmed spectacles, said a few words in Russian, and 
then he talked for an hour in broken English, explaining how 
the Russians had won their way to freedom, and now would use 
it to set free the rest of the proletariat. And then came Com- 
rade Schultze, of the Carpet Weavers' Union, assuring them 
that there was no need to go to war with Germany, because 
the German workers had been shown the way to freedom, and 
would follow very soon; Schultze knew, because his brother was 
editor of a Socialist paper in Leipzig, and he had inside in- 
formation as to what was going on in the Fatherland. 

Then Comrade Smith, the editor of the "Worker' was intro- 
duced, and the trouble began. The young editor wasted no 
time in preliminaries ; he was an international revolutionist, and 
no capitalist government was going to draft him for its bloody 
knaveries. Never would he be led out to murder his fellow- 
workers, whether in Germany, Austria, Bulgaria or Turkey; 
the masters of Wall Street would find that when they set out to 
drive American freemen to the slaughter-pen, they had made 
the mistake of their greedy lives. "Understand me," declared 
Comrade Smith though there seemed so far to have been 
nothing in which any one could possibly have misunderstood 
him "understand me, I am no pacifist, I am not opposed to 
war it is merely that I purpose to choose the war in which I 
fight. If they try to put a gun into my hands, I shall not 
refuse to take it not much, for I and my fellow wage-slaves 
have long wished for guns ! But I shall use my own judgment 
as to where I aim that gun whether at enemies in front of me, 
or at enemies behind me whether at my brothers, the working- 
men of Germany, or at my oppressors, the exploiters of Wall 
Street, their newspaper lackeys and military martinets!" 

The sentences of this speech came like the blows of a ham- 
mer, and they struck forth a clamour of applause from the 
audience. But suddenly the cheering crowd became aware that 
something out of the ordinary was happening. An aged, white- 
whiskered man clad in a faded blue uniform had risen from 
his seat in the middle of the hall and was shouting and waving 
his arms. People near him were trying to pull him down into 
his seat, but he would not be squelched, he went on shouting; 
and the audience in part fell silent out of curiosity. "Shame ! 





Shame!" they heard him cry. "Shame upon you!" And he 
pointed a trembling finger at the orator, declaring, "You are 
talking treason, young man I" 

"Sit down !" shrieked the crowd. "Shut up !" 

But the old man turned upon them. "Are there no Ameri- 
cans at all in this audience? Will you listen to this shameless 
traitor without one word?" 

People caught him by the coat-tails, men shook their fists 
at him; at the other side of the hall "Wild Bill" leaped up on 
a chair, shrieking : "Cut his throat, the old geezer !" 

Two policemen came running down the aisle, and the "old 
geezer" appealed to them: "What are you here for, if not to 
protect the flag and the honour of America?" But the police- 
men insisted that he stop interrupting the meeting, and so the 
old man turned and stalked out from the hall. But he did not 
go until he had turned once more and shaken his fist at the 
crowd, yelling in his cracked voice, "Traitors ! Traitors !" 



Poor Jimmie remained in his seat, overwhelmed. That he, 
the most devoted of workers for Socialism, should have been 
the cause of such a disgraceful scene bringing to this revolu- 
tionary meeting a man in the uniform of a killer of the work- 
ing-class ! He could not stay and face the comrades ; before the 
speaking had finished he gave Lizzie a nudge, and the two got 
up and stole out, dodging every one they knew. 

Outside they stood in perplexity. They thought, of course, 
that the old man would have driven away without them; they 
pictured the long walk from the trolley-line in the darkness and 
mud and with Lizzie dressed in her only Sunday-go-to-meeting ! 
But when they went to the place where Mr. Drew had left his 
buggy, to their surprise they found him patiently waiting for 
them. Seeing them hesitate, he said, "Come ! Get in !" They 
were much embarrassed, but obeyed, and the old mare started 
her amble towards home. 

They rode for a long time in silence. Finally Jimmie 
could not stand it, and began, "I'm so sorry, Mr. Drew. You 

don't understand " But the old man cut him off : "There's 

no use you and me tryin' to talk, young man." So they rode 



 

the rest of the way without a sound except that once Jimmie 
imagined he heard Lizzie sobbing to herself. 

Jimmie really felt terribly about it, for he had for this old 
soldier a deep respect, even an affection. Mr. Drew had made 
his impression not so much by his arguments, which Jimmie 
considered sixty years out of date, as by his personality. Here 
was one patriot who was straight ! What a pity that he could 
not understand the revolutionary point of view! What a pity 
that he had to be made angry ! It was one more of the horrors 
of war, which tore friends apart, and set them to disputing 
and hating one another. 

At least, that was the way it seemed to Jimmie that night, 
while he was still full of the speeches he had heard. But at 
other times doubts assailed him for of course a man cannot 
defy and combat a whole community without sometimes being 
led to wonder whether the community may not have some right 
on its side. Jimmie would hear of things the Germans had 
done in the war; they were such dirty fighters, they went out 
of their way to do such utterly revolting and useless, almost 
insane things! They made it so needlessly hard for any one 
who tried to defend them to think of them even as human 
beings. Jimmie would argue that he did not mean to help the 
Germans; he would resent bitterly the charges of the Leesville 
newspapers that he was a German agent and a traitor; but he 
could not get away from the uncomfortable fact that the things 
he was doing did have a tendency to further German interests, 
at least for a time. 

When that was pointed out to him by some patriot in a con- 
troversy, his answer would be that he was appealing to the 
German Socialists to revolt against their military leaders; but 
then the patriot would begin to find fault with the German 
Socialists, declaring that they were much better Germans than 
Socialists, and citing utterances and actions to prove it. One 
German Socialist had stood up in the Eeichstag and declared 
that the Germans had two ways of fighting their armies over- 
came their enemies in the field, while their Socialists under- 
mined the morale of the workers in enemy countries. When 
that passage was read to Jimmie, he answered that it was a 
lie ; no such speech had ever been made by a Socialist. He had 
no way of proving it was a lie, of course; he just knew it! 
But then, when he went away and thought it over, he began to 





wonder; suppose it were true! Suppose the German workers 
had been so drilled and schooled in childhood that even those 
who called themselves revolutionists were patriots at heart! 
Jimmie would begin to piece this and that together things 
he had heard or read. Certainly these German Socialists were 
not displaying any great boldness in fighting their government ! 

The answer was that they could not oppose their govern- 
ment, because they would be put in jail. But that was a pretty 
poor answer; it was their business to go to jail if not, what 
right had they to expect Jimmie Higgins to go here in America ? 
Jimmie presented this problem to Comrade Meissner, who an- 
swered that if Jimmie would go first, then doubtless the Ger- 
man comrades would follow. But Jimmie could not see why 
he should be first; and when they tried to clear up the reason, 
it developed that down in his heart Jimmie had begun to believe 
that Germany was more to blame for the war than America. 
And not merely would Comrade Meissner not admit that, but 
he became excited and vehement, trying to convince Jimmie that 
the other capitalist governments of the world were the cause of 
the war Germany was only defending herself against them! 
So there they were, involved in a controversy, just like any two 
non-revolutionary people ! Eepeating over the same arguments 
which had gone on in the local between Norwood, the lawyer, 
and Schneider, the brewer; only this time Jimmie was taking 
the side of Norwood ! Jimmie found himself face to face with 
the disconcerting fact that his devoted friend Meissner was a 
German and therefore in some subtle way different from 
him, unable to see things as he did! 





WAR or no war, the soil had to be ploughed and seed sown; 
so John Cutter came to his tenant and proposed that he 
should resume his job as farm-hand. Only he must agree to 
shut up about the war, for while Cutter himself was not a 
rabid patriot, he would take no chances of having his tenant- 
house burned down some night. So there was another discus- 
sion in the Higgins family. Lizzie remembered how during the 
previous summer Jimmie had worked from dawn till dark, and 
been too tired even to read Socialist papers, to say nothing of 
carrying on propaganda: which seemed to the distracted wife 
of a propagandist the most desirable condition possible! Poor 
Eleeza Betooser twice again she had been compelled to take 
down the stocking from her right leg, and unsew the bandage 
round her ankle, and extract another of those precious yellow 
twenty dollar bills; there were only seven of them left now, 
and each of them was more valuable to Lizzie than her eye- 
teeth. 

Jimmie finally agreed that he would gag himself, so far as 
concerned this country-side. What was the use of trying to 
teach anything to these barnyard boobs? They wanted war 
let them go to war, and be blown to bits or poisoned in the 
trenches ! If Jimmie had propaganding to do, he would do it 
in the city, where the workingmen had brains, and knew who 
their enemies were. So once more Jimmie harnessed up John 
Cutter's horses to the plough, and went out into John Cutter's 
field to raise another crop of corn for a man whom he hated. 
All day he guided the plough or the harrow, and at night he fed 
and cared for the horses and the cows, and then he came home 
and ate his supper, listening to the rattling of the long freight- 





train that went through his back yard, carrying materials for 
the making of TNT. 

For the great explosives plant was now working day and 
night, keeping the war in Jimmie's thoughts all the time, 
whether he would or not. In the midnight hours the trains of 
finished materials went out, making Jimmie's windows rattle 
with their rumble and clatter, and bearing his fancies away to 
the battle-line across the seas, where men were soon to be blown 
to pieces with the contents of these cars. One night something 
went wrong on the track, and the train stopped in his back yard, 
and in the morning he saw the cars, painted black, with the 
word "Danger" in flaming red letters. On top of the cars 
walked a man with a club in his hand and a bulge on his hip, 
keeping guard. 

It appeared that some one had torn up a rail in the night, 
evidently for the purpose of wrecking the train; so there came 
a detective to Jimmie, while he was working in the field, to 
cross-question him. They had Jimmie's record, and suspected 
him of knowing more than he would tell. "Aw, go to hell!" 
exclaimed the irate Socialist. "D'you suppose, if I'd wanted 
to smash anything, I'd 'a done it on the place where I work?" 
And then, when he went home to dinner, he found that they 
had been after Lizzie, and had frightened her out of her wits. 
They had threatened to turn them out of their home; Jimmie 
saw himself hounded here and there by this accursed war 
until it finished by seizing him and dragging him to the 
trenches I 

II 

The new Congress had met, and declared a state of war 
with Germany, and the whole country was rushing into arms. 
Men were enlisting by hundreds of thousands; but that was 
not enough for the militarists they wanted a conscription-law, 
so that every man might be compelled to go. If they were so 
sure of themselves and their wonderful war, why weren't they 
satisfied to let those fight it who wanted to ? So argued the 
rebellious Jimmie and his anti-militarist associates. But no! 
the militarists knew perfectly well that the bulk of the people 
did not want to fight, so they proposed to make them fight. 
Every energy of the Socialist movement was now concentrated 
on the blocking of this conscription scheme. 




Local Leesville hired the Opera-house again, organising a 
mass-meeting of protest, and the capitalist papers of the city 
began clamouring against this meeting. Was the patriotism 
and loyalty of Leesville to be affronted by another gathering of 
sedition and treason? The "Herald" told all over again the 
story of the gallant old civil war veteran who had risen in his 
seat and shouted his protest against the incitements of "Jack" 
Smith, the notorious "red" editor. The "Herald" printed a 
second time the picture of the gallant old veteran in his faded 
blue uniform, and the list of battles in which he had fought, 
from the first Bull Run to the last siege of Richmond. Some 
farmer passing by handed a copy of this paper to Lizzie, adding 
that if there was any more treason-talk in this locality there 
was going to be a lynching-bee. So Jimmie found his wife in 
tears again. She was absolutely determined that he should not 
go to that meeting. For three days she wept and argued with 
him, and for a part of three nights. 

It would have been comical if it had not been so tragic. Jim- 
mie would use the old argument, that if he did not succeed in 
stopping the war, he would be dragged into the trenches and 
killed. So, of course, Lizzie would become a pacifist at once. 
What right had the war to take Jimmie from her? The little 
Jimmies had a right to their father ! All children had a right 
to their fathers! But then, after Lizzie had expressed these 
tearful convictions, Jimmie would say, All right, then he must 
go to that meeting, he must do what he could to prevent the 
war. And poor Lizzie would find herself suddenly confronting 
the terrors of the police with their clubs and the patriots with 
their buckets of tar and bags of feathers! No, Jimmie must 
not carry on any propaganda, Jimmie must not go to the meet- 
ing ! Poor Jimmie would try to pin her down : which way did 
she want him killed, by the Germans, or by the police and the 
mobs? But Lizzie did not want him killed either way! She 
wanted him to go on living! 

Jimmie would try to arrange a compromise for the present. 
He would go to the meeting, but he would promise not to say 
a word. But that did not console Lizzie she knew that if 
anything happened, her man would get into it. No, if he were 
determined to go, she would go too even if they had to load 
the three babies into the perambulator, and push them two or 
three miles to the trolley ! If Jimmie tried to make a speech,. 





she would -hang onto his coat-tails, she would clasp her hands 
over his mouth, she would throw herself between him and the 
clubs of the policemen! 

So matters stood, when on the afternoon before the meeting 
there came a heavy rain, and the road to the trolley was ren- 
dered impossible for a triple-loaded baby-carriage. So there 
were more hysterics in the family; Jimmie took his wife's hand 
in his and solemnly swore to her that she might trust him to 
go to this meeting, he would not do anything that could by any 
possibility get him into trouble. He would not try to make 
a speech, he would not get up and shout no matter what hap- 
pened, he would not say a word! He would merely sell 
pamphlets, and show people to their seats, as he had done at a 
hundred meetings before. To make sure of his immunity, he 
would even leave off the red badge which he was accustomed 
to display on Socialist occasions! By these pledges repeated 
over and over, he finally succeeded in pacifying his weeping 
spouse, and gently removed her clutch on his coat-tails, and 
departed, waving his hand to her and the kids. 

The last thing he saw through the rain was Jimmie Junior, 
flourishing a red handkerchief which Lizzie at the last moment 
had extracted from her husband's pocket. The last sound he 
heard was Jimmie Junior's voice, shouting : "You be good now ! 
You shut up I" Jimmie went off, thinking about this little tike ; 
he was five years old, and growing so that you could notice the 
difference over night. He had big black eyes like his mother, 
and a grin full of all the mischief in the world. The things 
he knew and the questions he asked ! Jimmie and Lizzie never 
got tired of talking about them; Jimmie recalled them one 
by one, as he trudged through the mud and, as always, he set 
his lips and clenched his hands, and took up anew the task of 
making the world a fit place for a workingman's child to grow 
up in ! 

Ill 

The principal orator of the evening was a young college 
professor who had been turned out of his job for taking the 
side of the working-class in his public utterances, and who was 
therefore a hero to Jimmie Higgins. This young man had the 
facts of the war at his finger tips; he made you see it as a 




gigantic conspiracy of capitalists the world over to complete 
their grip on the raw materials of wealth, and on the bodies and 
souls of the workers. He bitterly denounced those who had 
forced the country into the war; he denounced the Wall Street 
speculators and financiers who had made their billions already, 
and would be making their tens of billions. He denounced the 
plan to force men to fight who did not wish to fight, and his 
every sentence was followed by a burst of applause from the 
throng which packed the Opera-house. If you judged by this 
meeting, you would conclude that America was on the verge 
of a revolution against the war. 

The young professor sat down, wiping the perspiration from 
his pale forehead; and then the Liederkranz sang again only 
it was not called the Liederkranz now, it had become known as 
the "Workers' Singing Society' out of deference to local preju- 
dice. Then arose Comrade Smith, editor of the "Worker," and 
announced that after the collection the orator would answer 
questions; then Comrade Smith launched into a speech of his 
own, to the effect that something definite ought to be done by 
the workers of Leesville to make clear their opposition to being 
dragged into war. For his part he wished to say that he would 
not yield one inch to the war-clamour he was on record as 
refusing to be drafted in any capitalist war, and he was ready 
to join with others to agree that they would not be drafted. The 
time was short -if anything were to be done, they must act 
at once 

And then suddenly came an interruption this time not from 
an old soldier, but from a sergeant of police who had been stand- 
ing at one side of the stage, and who now stepped forward, 
announcing, "This meeting is closed." 

"What ?" shouted the orator. 

"This meeting is closed," repeated the other. "And you, 
young man, are under arrest." 

There was a howl from the audience, and suddenly from 
the pit in front of the stage, whence ordinarily the orchestra 
dispensed sweet music, there leaped a line of blue-uniformed 
men, distributing themselves between the public and the speaker. 
At the same time down the centre aisle came a dozen soldiers 
marching, with guns in their hands and bayonets fixed. 

"This is an outrage!" shouted Comrade Smith. 

"Not another word!" commanded the police official; and 





two policemen who had followed him grabbed the orator by each 
arm and started to lead him off the stage. 

Comrade Gerrity leaped to the front of the platform. "I 
denounce this proceeding!" he shouted. "We are holding an 
orderly meeting here " 

A policeman laid hold of him. "You are under arrest." 

Then came Comrade Mabel Smith, sister of the editor of the 
"Worker." "For shame ! For shame !" she cried. And then, 
to a policeman, "No, I will not be silent! I protest in the 

name of free speech ! I declare " And when the policeman 

seized her by the arm, she continued to shout at the top of 
her lungs, driving the crowd to frenzy. 

There were disturbances all over the audience. Mrs. Ger- 
rity, wife of the organiser, sprang up in her seat and began to 
protest. It happened that Jimmie Higgins was in the aisle 
not far from her, and his heart leaped with strange, half-for- 
gotten emotions as he saw this trim little figure, with the jaunty 
hat and the turkey-feather stuck on one side. Comrade Evelyn 
Baskerville, of Greenwich Village, she of the fluffy brown hair 
and the pert little dimples and the bold and terrifying ideas, 
she who had so ploughed up the soul of Jimmie Higgins and 
almost broken up the Higgins home here she was, employing 
a new variety of coquetry, by which she compelled three soldiers 
with rifles and bayonets to devote their exclusive attention to 
her! 

And then Comrade Mary Allen, the Quaker lady, who be- 
lieved in moral force applied through the ear-drums. She stood 
in the aisle with her armful of pamphlets and her red sash 
over her shoulder, proclaiming, "In the name of liberty and 
fair play I protest against this outrage! I will not see my 
country dragged into war without asserting my right of protest ! 
I stand here, in what is supposed to be a Christian city; I 

speak in the name of the Prince of Peace " and so on, quite 

a little speech, while several embarrassed young men in khaki 
were trying to find out how to hold their rifles and a shouting 
Quakeress at the same time. 

And then Comrade Schneider, the brewer. He had been 
up on the stage with the singers, and now got somehow to the 
front. "Haf we got no rights in America left?" he shouted. 
"Do we in this audience " 

"Shut up, you Hun!" roared some one in the front of the 



 

crowd, and three policemen at once leaped for Comrade 
Schneider, and grabbed him by the collar, twisting so hard 
that the German's face, always purple when he was excited,

Outside, a crowd gathered to jeer while the prisoners were 
loaded into the patrol-wagon; but the police drove them away, 
keeping everybody moving, and breaking up several attempts at 
street-oratory. Jimmie found himself with half a dozen other 
comrades, wandering aimlessly down Main Street, talking over 
and over what had happened, each explaining why and how he 
had not shared the crown of martyrdom. Some had shouted as
