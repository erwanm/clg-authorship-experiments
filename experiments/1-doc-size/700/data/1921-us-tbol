and such proportion of phosphorus and iron; you should avoid certain
acids--and so on. But at present we are devoting our science to the task
of killing and maiming other people, instead of enabling ourselves to
live in health and happiness; so it is that most of those who read this
book will be too poor to command the advice of a diet specialist. The
best you can do is to get a few general ideas and try them out, watching
your own body and learning its peculiarities.

Human food contains three elements: proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
The proteins are the body-building material, and the foods which are
rich in proteins are lean meat, the white of eggs, milk and cheese,
nuts, peas and beans. A certain amount of this kind of food is needed by
the body. If it is missing, the body will gradually waste away. If too
much of it is taken, the body can turn it into energy-making material,
but this is a wasteful process, and the best evidence appears to be that
it is a strain upon the system. Experiments conducted by Professor
Chittenden of Yale have proven conclusively that men can live and
maintain body weight upon much less protein food than previous dietetic
standards had indicated.

The fats are found in fat meats and dairy products, and in nuts, olives,
and vegetable oils. The body is prepared to digest and assimilate a
certain amount of fat, no one knows how much. I have found in my own
case that I require a great deal less than people ordinarily eat. I have
for many years maintained good health upon a diet containing no more fat
than one gets with lean meat once or twice a day. I never use butter or
olive oil, nor any fat in cooking. My reason for this is that fats are
the most highly concentrated form of food, and the easiest upon which to
overeat. Excess of fat is a cause, not merely of obesity, but also of
boils and pimples and "pasty" complexion, and other signs of a clogged
blood-stream.

The third variety of food is the carbohydrates, and of these there are
two kinds, starches and sugars. Starch is the white material of the
grains and tubers; the principal food element of bread and cereals,
rice, potatoes, bananas, and many prepared substances such as
corn-starch, tapioca, farina and macaroni. Starchy foods compose
probably half the diet of the average human being. In my own case, they
compose about one-sixth, so you see to what extent my beliefs differ
from the common. Starch is not really necessary in the diet at all. I
have a friend who is subject to headaches, and finds relief from them by
a diet of meat, salads, and fresh fruits exclusively. The first thing
that excess of starch or sugar does is to ferment in the system, and
cause flatulence and gas. But strange as it may seem, if the excess of
starch is perfectly digested and assimilated into the system, the
condition may be worse yet, because you may have a great quantity of
energy-producing material, without the necessary mineral elements which
the body requires in the handling of it.

If you cremate a human body and study the ashes chemically, you find a
score or more of mineral salts. You find these in the blood, and no
blood is normal and no body can be kept normal which does not contain
the right percentage of these elements. It is not merely that they are
needed to build bones and teeth; they are needed at every instant for
the chemistry of the cells. Every time you move a muscle, you fill the
cells of that muscle with a certain amount of waste matter. You may
prove how deadly this matter is by binding a tight cord about your arm,
and then trying to use the arm. We are only at the beginning of
understanding the subtle chemistry of the body; but this much we know,
the cells transform the waste products, and they are thrown out of the
system as ammonia, uric acid, etc.; and for this process the blood must
have a continual supply of many mineral salts.

So vital are they, and so fatal to health is their absence, that it is
far better for you to eat nothing at all than to eat improperly balanced
foods, or foods which are deficient in the organic salts. You may prove
this to yourself by a simple experiment. Put two chickens in separate
pens, where nobody can feed them but yourself. Feed one of them on water
and white bread, or corn starch, or sugar, or any energy-making
substance which contains little of the mineral elements. Feed the other
chicken on plain water. You will find that the one which has the food
will quickly become droopy and sickly; its feathers will fall out, it
will have what in human beings would be known as headaches, colds, sore
throats, decaying teeth and boils. At the end of a couple of weeks it
will be a dead chicken. The one which you feed on water alone will not
be a happy chicken, neither will it be a fat chicken, but it will be a
live chicken, and a chicken without disease. I am going later on to
discuss the subject of fasting. For the present I will merely say that a
chicken which has nothing but water is living upon its own flesh, and
therefore has a meat diet, containing the mineral elements necessary to
the elimination of the fatigue poisons.

I am going to try not to be dogmatic in this book, and not to say things
that I do not know. I confess to innumerable uncertainties about the
subject of diet; but one thing I think I do know, and that is that human
beings should eliminate absolutely from their food those modern
artificial products, which look so nice, and are so easy to handle, and
are put up in packages with pretty labels, and have been in some way
artificially treated to remove the wastes and impurities--including the
vital mineral salts. Among such food substances I include lard and its
imitations made from cottonseed oil, white flour, all the prepared and
refined cereals, polished rice, tapioca, farina, corn starch, and
granulated and powdered sugar. Any of these substances will kill a
chicken in a couple of weeks, and the only reason they take a longer
time to kill you is because you mix them with other kinds of foods. But
to the extent that you eat them, your diet is deficient; and do not
console yourself with the idea that the mineral elements will be made up
from other foods, because you don't know that, and nobody else knows it.
Nobody knows just how much of any particular organic salt the body
needs. All we know is that the primitive races, which ate natural foods,
enjoyed vigorous health, while the American people, who consume the
greatest proportion of the so-called "refined" foods, have the very best
dentists and the very worst teeth in the world.

There are many kinds of sugar, found in the sugar-cane and the beet, and
in all fruits. Sugar may also be made from any form of starch; this is
glucose, which is put up in cans and sold as an imitation of maple
syrup. The ordinary granulated and powdered sugar is made by taking from
the natural syrup every trace of mineral elements; so I have no
hesitation in saying that the ordinary cane sugar and beet sugar of our
breakfast tables and our confectionery stores is not a food, but a slow
poison. The causes of the wonderful progress of American dentistry,
which is the marvel of the civilized world, are cane sugar, white flour,
and the frying-pan, each of which dietetic crimes I shall take up in
turn.

We have the richest country in the world; we eat more food, probably by
50 per cent, and we waste more food, probably by 500 per cent, than any
other people in the world; and yet, go to any small farming community in
America, and what do you find? You find the teeth of the young children
rotting in their heads, and having to be pulled out before their second
teeth come. You find these second teeth rotting often before the age of
twenty. A friend of mine, who knows the American farmer, sums it up this
way: "He has two things that he requires if he is to be really
respectable and happy. First, he wants to get all the fireplaces in his
home boarded up, and all the windows nailed tight; and second, he wants
to get all his teeth out, and an artificial set installed. Out of the
farmers' wives in my neighborhood, not one in ten keeps her own teeth
until she is thirty."

If you go to the Balkans, where the peasants live on sour milk, with
grains which they grind at home; or to southern Italy and Sicily, where
they live on cheese and black bread and olives; or among savage people,
where they hunt and fish and gather the natural fruits, you find old
men without a single decayed tooth. There must be some reason for this,
and the reason is found in our denatured grocery-store foods. The
farmer's wife will gather up her eggs and her butter and cheeses, and
take them to the store and bring back cans of lard and packages of
sugar. The farmer will sell his perfectly good wheat and corn meal, and
bring back in his wagon cases of "refined" cereal foods, for which he
has paid ten times the price of the grain!

Dentists will tell you that the way candy injures the teeth is by
sticking to them and fermenting, forming acids, which destroy the tooth
structure. And that may be a part of the reason. But the principal
reason why the teeth decay is because the blood-stream is abnormal, and
is unable to keep up the repairs of the body. Your teeth are living
structures, just as much as any other part of you, and they will resist
decay if you supply them with the proper nourishment.

You need sugar; you need a considerable quantity of it every day. Nature
provides this sugar in combination with the organic salts, and also with
the precious vitamines, whose function in the body we are only beginning
to investigate. All the mineral substances which give the color and
flavor to oranges, apples, peaches, grapes, figs, prunes, raisins--all
these you take out when you make sugar. Or perhaps you put in some
imitations of them, made from coal tar chemicals, and drink them at your
soda fountains! So little appreciation has the American farmer's wife of
natural fruits, that when she preserves them, she considers it necessary
to fill them full of cane sugar; in fact, she has a notion that they
won't keep unless she cooks them up with sugar! So snobbish are we
Americans about our eating, that we make the best of our foods into
bywords. We make jokes in our comic papers about the "boarding-house
prune"; and yet prunes and raisins are among the wholesomest foods we
have, and if we fed them to our children instead of cakes and candy and
coal-tar flavorings, our dental industry would rapidly decline.

And the same thing is true of bread. When I was a boy, I thought I had
to have hot bread at least twice a day, and if I were called upon to eat
bread that was more than a day old, I felt that I was being badly abused
by life. I used to read fairy stories, in which something called "black
bread" was mentioned, something obscure and terrible; the symbol of
human misery was Cinderella sitting in the ashes and eating a crust of
dry "black bread." But now since I have studied diet, I have taken my
place with Cinderella. I can afford to buy whatever kind of bread I
want; I can have the best white bread, piping hot, three times a day, if
I want it; but what I eat three times a day is a crust of hard dry
"black bread."

"Black bread" is the fairy story name for bread made of the whole grain.
It is eaten that way by the peasant because he has no patent milling
machinery at his disposal, to fan away the life-giving elements of his
food. Nearly all the mineral elements of the grain are contained in the
outer, dark-colored portion. The white part is almost pure starch; and
when you use white flour, you are not merely starving your blood-stream,
your bones, and your teeth, you are also depriving the digestive tract
of the rough material which it is accustomed to handle, and which it
needs to stimulate it to action. I am aware that whole grain products
are a trifle less easy of digestion, but we should not pamper and weaken
our digestive tract any more than we let our muscles get flabby for lack
of action. We should require our stomachs to handle the ordinary natural
foods, precisely as we accustom our body to react from cold water, and
to stand honest hard work.

For ages the Japanese peasants have lived on rice, with a little dried
fish. Quite recently there began to spread throughout Japan a mysterious
disease known as beri-beri. It was especially prevalent in the army, and
so the scientists of Japan set out to discover the cause, and it proved
to be the modern practice of polishing rice, which takes off the outer
coating of the grain. Rice is one of the most wholesome of foods, if it
is eaten in the natural state; but in order to get it in that state in
this country, you have to find a special food store of the health
cranks, and have to pay a special price for it. You have to pay a higher
price for whole wheat bread--because ninety-nine people out of a hundred
are ignorant, and insist upon having their foodstuffs pretty to look at!

Probably you have read sea stories, and know of the horrors of scurvy.
Scurvy and beri-beri are similar diseases, with a similar cause. The men
on the old sailing ships used to have to live on white biscuit and salt
meat, and they always knew that to recover from their gnawing illness,
they must get to port and get fresh vegetables and fruits, especially
onions and lemons, which contain the vitamines as well as the salts. But
you will see the modern housewife going into the grocery store, and
surveying the shelves of "package" goods, and in her ignorance picking
out the scurvy-making products, and frequently paying for them a much
higher price than for the health-making ones!

Then, when she has got her white flour, and her cane sugar, and her
lard, she will take it home, and mix it up, and put it in the frying
pan, and serve it hot to her husband and children. Nature has so
constituted her husband and children that they digest starch before they
digest fat; that is to say, the starch is digested mainly in the
stomach, while the fat is digested mainly after the food has been passed
on into the small intestine. But by frying the starch before it is
eaten, the housewife carefully takes each grain of the starch and
protects it with a little covering of fat. Thus the digestive juices of
the stomach cannot get at the starch, and the starch goes down into the
small intestine a good part undigested. If some evil spirit, wishing to
make trouble for the human organism, had charge of the laying out of our
diet, he could hardly devise anything worse than that. And yet it would
be no exaggeration to say that the average American, especially the
average farmer, eats out of a frying-pan. If his potatoes have to be
warmed over, they go into the frying-pan; his precious batter-cakes and
doughnuts are cooked in a frying-pan, and all his precious hot breads
are mixed with lard. If it were not for the fact that you cannot broil a
beefsteak over a modern gas range, I would tell you that the first step
toward health for the average American would be to throw the frying-pan
out of the window, and to throw the cook-book after it.

The whole modern art of cooking is largely a perversion; a product of
idleness, vanity, and sensuality. It is one of the monstrous growths
consequent upon our system of class exploitation. We have a number of
idle people with nothing to do but eat, and who demonstrate their
superiority to the rest of us by their knowledge of superior foods, and
superior ways of preparing them. They have the wealth of the world at
their disposal, also the services of their fellow man without limit, and
they set their fellow man to work to enable them to give elaborate
banquets, and to sit in solemn state and gorge themselves, and to have a
full account of their behavior published in the next morning's
newspapers. A great part of this perverse art we owe to what is called
the "ancient régime" in France--a régime which starved the French
peasantry until they were black skinned beasts hiding in caves and
hollow trees. So it comes about that our modern food depravity parades
itself in French names, and American snobbery requires of its devotees a
course in the French language sufficient to read a menu card. Needless
to say, this elaborate gastronomic art has been developed without any
relation to health, or any thought of the true needs of the body. It is
one of the products of the predatory system which we can say is absolute
waste. Having done my own cooking for the past twenty-five years, I make
bold to say that I can teach anybody all he needs to know about cooking
in one lesson of half an hour, and that the total amount of cooking
required for a large family can be done by one person in twenty minutes
a day.

In the first place, a great many foods do not have to be cooked at all,
and are made less fit by cooking. In the next place, the only cooking
that is ever required is a little boiling, or in the case of meat,
roasting or broiling. In the next place, the art of combining foods in
cooking is a waste art, because no foods should be combined in cooking.
Every food has its own natural flavor, which is lost in combination, and
if anybody is unable to enjoy the natural flavors of simply cooked
foods, there is one thing to say to that person, and that is to wait
until he is hungry. Let him take a ten-mile walk in the open air, and he
will have more interest in his next meal. I am not a fanatic, and have
no desire to destroy the pleasures of life; I am recommending to people
that they should seek the higher pleasures of the intellect, and those
pleasures are not found in standing over a cook stove, nor in compelling
others to stand over a cook stove. Moreover, I know that the artificial
mixing of foods to tempt peoples' palates is one of the principal causes
of overeating, and therefore of ill health, and therefore of the
ultimate destruction of the pleasures of life.

I went out from the world of cooks before I was twenty. I wanted to
write a book, and to be let alone while I was doing it. I lived by
myself, and found out about cooking by practical experience. On a few
occasions since then, I have lived in a house with a servant, and had
some cooking done for me, but it was always because somebody else
wanted it, and against my protest. In the last ten years we have had no
servant in our home, and because I want my wife to give her energy to
more important things than feeding me, I do my share of getting every
meal. We have worked out a system of housekeeping by which we get a meal
in five minutes, and when we finish it, it takes three minutes to clear
things away.

If I tell you what I eat, please do not get the impression that I am
advising you to eat these same things. My diet consists of the foods
which I have found by long experience agree with me. There are many
other foods which are just as wholesome, but which I do not eat, either
because they don't happen to agree with me, or because I don't care for
them so much. I am fond of fruit, and eat more of that than of anything
else. It is not a cheap article of diet, but you can save a good deal if
you buy it in quantities, as I do. A little later I am going to discuss
the prices of foods.

For breakfast I eat a slice of whole wheat bread, three good-sized
apples, stewed, and eight or ten dates. It takes practically no time to
prepare this breakfast. The bread has to be baked, of course, but this
is done wholesale; we buy four loaves at a time, and it is just as good
at the end of a couple of weeks as when we buy it. When I lived in the
world of cooks, I would call for apple sauce; which meant that somebody
had to pare apples, cut them up, stew them, mix them with sugar, grate a
little nutmeg over them, set them on ice, and serve them to me on a
glass dish, with a little pitcher of cream. But now what happens is that
I put a dozen apples in a big sauce-pan and let them simmer while I am
eating. We have a rule in our family that we do not do any cooking
except while we are eating, because if we try it at any other time of
the day, we get buried in a book or in a manuscript, and forget about it
until the smoke causes somebody in the street to summon the fire
department. So the apples for my breakfast were cooked during last
night's supper; and during the breakfast there will be some vegetable
cooking for lunch.

At this lunch, which is my "square meal," I eat a large slice of
beefsteak, say a third of a pound. Jack London used to say that the only
man who could cook a beefsteak was the fireman of a railway locomotive,
because he had a hot, clean shovel. The best imitation you can get is a
hot, clean frying-pan; and when you are sure that it is hot, let it get
hotter. The whole secret of cooking meat is to keep the juices inside,
and to do that you must cook it quickly. When you slap it down on a hot
frying-pan, the meat is seared, and the juices stay inside, and if you
do not turn it over until it is almost ready to burn, you don't need to
cook it very long on the other side. That is the one secret of cooking
worth knowing; it doesn't cost anything, and saves time instead of
wasting it. As I have never found anybody else capable of learning it, I
reserve the cooking of the beefsteak as one of my family duties.

To continue the lunch, a slice of whole wheat bread, and a large
quantity of some fresh salad, such as celery, or lettuce and tomatoes,
without dressing. For a part of this may be substituted a vegetable, one
or two beets or turnips, cooked during a previous meal, and warmed up in
a couple of minutes; and we do not throw away the tops of the turnips
and beets and celery, we put them on and cook them, and they serve for
the next day's meal. If you would eat a large quantity of such "greens"
once a day, you would escape many of the ills that your flesh is at
present heir to. Finally, for dessert, an orange and a small handful of
raisins, or one or two figs.

The evening meal will be the same as the breakfast; except once in a
while when I am especially hungry, and want some meat. I am writing in
the winter season, so the fruits suggested are those available in
winter. The menu will be varied with every kind of fruit at the season
when it is cheapest and most easily obtained. The beefsteak will appear
at about three meals out of four; occasionally it will be replaced by
the lean meat of pork or mutton, or by fish. The bread may be replaced
by rice, or boiled potatoes, either white or sweet, and occasionally by
graham crackers. I know that these contain a little fat and sugar, but I
try not to be fanatical about my diet, and the rules I suggest do not
carry the death penalty. There was a time when I used to allow my
friends to make themselves miserable by trying to provide me with
special foods when they invited me to a meal, but now I tell them to
"forget it," and I politely nibble a little of everything, and eat most
of what I find wholesome; if there is nothing wholesome, I content
myself with the pretense of a meal. If I find myself in a restaurant, I
quite shamelessly get a piece of apple or pumpkin pie, omitting most of
the crust. As I don't go away from home more than once or twice a month,
I do not have to worry about such indulgence. The main thing is to
arrange one's home diet on sound lines, and learn to enjoy the simple
and wholesome foods, of which there is a great variety obtainable, and
at prices possible to all but the wretchedly poor.

In conclusion, since everybody likes to have a feast now and then, I
specify that my diet regimen allows for holidays. Assuming that I am
your guest for a day, and that you wish to "blow" me, regardless of
expense, here will be the menu. Breakfast, some graham crackers, a bunch
of raisins, a can of sliced pineapple in winter, or a big chunk of
watermelon in summer. Dinner, or lunch, roast pork, a baked apple, a
baked sweet potato and some spinach. Supper, lettuce, dates, and a dish
of popcorn flavored with peanut butter. Try this next Christmas!

P. S. After this book had been put into type, I chanced to be looking
over Herbert Quick's illuminating book, "On Board the Good Ship Earth."
Discussing the importance of certain organic salts to the body, Dr.
Quick states: "Animals have been fed, as an experiment, on foods
deficient in phosphorus. For a while they seemed to do well. Then they
collapsed. It takes only three months of a ration without phosphorus to
wreck an animal. Individual creatures were killed after a month of this
diet, and it was found that the flesh was taking the phosphate--for the
phosphorus exists in the body in that form--from the bones to supply its
need. In other words, the body was eating its own bones! When this
process had robbed the bones to the limit, the collapse came, and the
animal could never recover."




CHAPTER XXI

DIET STANDARDS

     (Discusses various foods and their food values, the quantities we
     need, and their money cost.)

I think there is no more important single question about health than the
question of how much food we should eat. It is one about which there is
a great deal of controversy, even among the best authorities. We shall
try here for a common-sense solution. At the outset we have to remind
ourselves of the distinction we tried to draw between nature and man. To
what extent can civilized man rely upon his instincts to keep him in
perfect health?

Let us begin by considering the animals. How is their diet problem
solved? Horses and cattle in a wild state are adjusted to certain foods
which they find in nature, and so long as they can find it, they have no
diet problem. Man comes, and takes these animals and domesticates them;
he observes their habits, and gives to them a diet closely approaching
the natural one, and they get along fairly well. But suppose the man,
with his superior skill in agriculture, taking wild grain and planting
it, reaping and threshing it by machinery, puts before his horse an
unlimited quantity of a concentrated food such as oats, which the horse
can never get in a natural state--will that horse's instincts guide it?
Not at all. Any horse will kill itself by overeating on grain.

I have read somewhere a clever saying, that a farm is a good place for
an author to live, provided he can be persuaded not to farm it. But once
upon a time I had not heard that wise remark, and I owned and tried to
run a farm. I had two beautiful cows of which I was very proud, and one
morning I woke up and discovered that the cows had got into the pear
orchard and had been feeding on pears all night. In a few hours they
both lay with bloated stomachs, dying. A farmer told me afterwards that
I might have saved their lives, if I had stuck a knife into their
stomachs to let out the gas. I do not know whether this is true or not.
But my two dead cows afford a perfect illustration of the reason why
civilized man cannot rely upon his instincts and his appetites to tell
him when he has had enough to eat. He can only do this, provided he
rigidly restricts himself to the foods which he ate in the days when his
teeth and stomach and bowels were being shaped by the process of natural
selection. If he is going to eat any other than such strictly natural
foods, he will need to apply his reason to his diet schedule.

In a state of nature man has to hunt his food, and the amount that he
finds is generally limited, and requires a lot of exercise to get.
Explorers in Africa give us a picture of man's life in the savage state,
guided by his instincts and very little interfered with by reason. The
savages will starve for long periods, then they will succeed in killing
a hippopotamus or a buffalo, and they will gorge themselves, and nearly
all of them will be ill, and several of them will die. So you see, even
in a state of nature, and with natural foods, restraint is needed, and
reason and moral sense have a part to play.

What do reason and moral sense have to tell us about diet? Our bodily
processes go on continuously, and we need at regular intervals a certain
quantity of a number of different foods. The most elementary experiment
will convince us that we can get along, maintain our body weight and our
working efficiency upon a much smaller quantity of food than we
naturally crave. Civilized custom puts before us a great variety of
delicate and appetizing foods, upon which we are disposed to overeat;
and we are slow observers indeed if we do not note the connection
between this overeating and ill health. So we are forced to the
conclusion that if we wish to stay well, we need to establish a
censorship over our habits; we need a different diet regimen from the
haphazard one which has been established for us by a combination of our
instincts with the perversions of civilization.

Up to a few years ago, it was commonly taken for granted by authorities
on diet that what the average man actually eats must be the normal thing
for him to eat. Governments which were employing men in armies, and at
road building, and had to feed them and keep them in health, made large
scale observations as to what the men ate, and thus were established the
old fashioned "diet standards." They are expressed in calories, which is
a heat unit representing the quantity of fuel required to heat a certain
small quantity of water a certain number of degrees. In order that you
may know what I am talking about, I will give a rough idea of the
quantity of the more common foods which it takes to make 100 calories:
one medium sized slice of bread, a piece of lean cooked steak the size
of two fingers, one large apple, three medium tablespoonfuls of cooked
rice or potatoes, one large banana, a tablespoonful of raisins, five
dates, one large fig, a teaspoonful of sugar, a ball of butter the size
of your thumbnail, a very large head of lettuce, three medium sized
tomatoes, two-thirds of a glass of milk, a tablespoonful of oil. You
observe, if you compare these various items, how little guidance
concerning food is given by its bulk. You may eat a whole head of
lettuce, weighing nearly a pound, and get no more food value than from a
half ounce of olive oil which you pour over it. You may eat enough lean
beefsteak to cover your plate, and you will not have eaten so much as a
generous helping of butter. A big bowl of strawberries will not count
half so much as the cream and sugar you put over them. So you may
realize that when you eat olive oil, butter, cream, and sugar, you are
in the same danger as the horse eating oats, or as my two cows in the
pear orchard; and if some day a surgeon has to come and stick a knife
into you, it may be for the same reason.

The old-fashioned diet standards are as follows: Swedish laborers at
hard work, over 4,700 calories; Russian workmen at moderate work, German
soldiers in active service, Italian laborers at moderate work, between
3,500 and 3,700 calories; English weavers, nearly 3,500 calories;
Austrian farm laborers, over 5,000 calories. Some twenty years ago the
United States government made observations of over 15,000 persons, and
established the following, known as the "Atwater standards": men at very
hard muscular work, 5,500 calories; men at moderately active muscular
work, 3,400 calories; men at light to moderate muscular work, 3,050
calories; men at sedentary, or women at moderately active work, 2,700
calories.

In the last ten or fifteen years there has arisen a new school of
dietetic experts, headed by Professors Chittenden and Fisher of Yale
University. Professor Chittenden has published an elaborate book, "The
Nutrition of Man," in which he tells of long-continued experiment upon a
squad of soldiers and a group of athletes at Yale University, also upon
average students and professors. He has proved conclusively that all
these various groups have been able to maintain full body weight and
full working efficiency upon less than half the quantity of protein food
hitherto specified, and upon anywhere from one-half to two-thirds the
calory value set forth in the former standards.

When I first read this book, I set to work to try its theories upon
myself. During the five or six months that I lived on raw food, I took
the trouble to weigh everything that I ate, and to keep a record. It is,
of course, very easy to weigh raw foods exactly, and I found that I
lived an active life and kept physical health upon slightly less than
2,500 calories a day. I have set this as my standard, and have
accustomed myself to follow it instinctively, and without wasting any
thought upon it. Sometimes I fall from grace; for I still crave the
delightful cakes and candies and ice cream upon which I was brought up.
I always pay the penalty, and know that I will not get back to my former
state of health until I skip a meal or two, and give my system a chance
to clean house. The average man will find the regimen set forth in this
book austere and awe-inspiring; I do not wish to pose as a paragon of
virtue, so perhaps I should quote a sarcastic girl cousin, who remarked
when I was a boy that the way to my heart was with a bag of
ginger-snaps. I live in the presence of candy stores and never think of
their existence, but if someone brings candy into the house and puts it
in front of me, I have to waste a lot of moral energy in letting it
alone. A few years ago I had a young man as secretary who discovered
this failing of mine, and used to afford himself immense glee by buying
a box of chocolates and leaving it on top of my desk. I would give him
back the box--with some of the chocolates missing--but he would persist
in "forgetting it" on my desk; he would hide and laugh hilariously
behind the door, until my wife discovered his nefarious doings, and
warned me of them.

Professor Chittenden states quite simply the common sense procedure in
the matter of food quantity. Find out by practical experiment what is
the very least food upon which you can do your work without losing
weight. That is the correct quantity for you, and if you are eating
more, you certainly cannot be doing your body any good, and all the
evidence indicates that you are doing it harm. You need not have the
least fear in making this experiment that you will starve yourself.
Later on, in a chapter on fasting, I shall prove to you that you carry
around with you in your body sufficient reserve of food to keep you
alive for eighty or ninety days; and if you draw on a small quantity of
this you do not do yourself the slightest harm. Cut down the amount of
your food; eat the bulky foods, which contain less calory value, and
weigh yourself every day, and you will be surprised to discover how much
less you need to eat than you have been accustomed to.

One of the things you will find out is that your stomach is easily
fooled; it is largely guided by bulk. If you eat a meal consisting of a
moderate quantity of lean meat, a very little bread, a heaping dish of
turnip greens, and a big slice of watermelon, you will feel fully
satisfied, yet you will not have taken in one-third the calory value
that you would at an ordinary meal with gravies and dressings and
dessert. The bulky kind of food is that for which your system was
adapted in the days when it was shaped by nature. You have a large
stomach, many times as large as you would have had if you had lived on
refined and concentrated foods such as butter, sugar, olive oil, cheese
and eggs. You have a long intestinal tract, adapted to slowly digesting
foods, and to the work of extracting nutrition from a mass of roughage.
You have a very large lower bowel, which Metchnikoff, the Russian
scientist, one of the greatest minds who ever examined the problems of
health, declares a survival, the relic of a previous stage of evolution,
and a source of much disease. The best thing you can do with that lower
bowel is to give it lots of hay, as it requires; in other words, to eat
the salads and greens which contain cellulose material. This contains no
food value, and does not ferment, but fills the lower bowel and
stimulates it to activity.

If you eat too much food, three things may happen. First, it may not be
digested, and in that case it will fill your system with poisons.
Second, it may be assimilated, but not burned up by the body. In that
case it has to be thrown out by the kidneys or the sweat glands, and
this puts upon these organs an extra strain, to which in the long run
they may be unequal. Or third, the surplus material may be stored up as
fat. This is an old-time trick which nature invented to tide you over
the times when food was scarce. If you were a bear, you would naturally
want to eat all you could, and be as fat as possible in November, so
that you might be able to hunt your prey when you came out from your
winter's sleep in April. But you are not a bear, and you expect to eat
your regular meals all winter; you have established a system of
civilization which makes you certain of your food, and the place where
you keep your surplus is in the bank, or sewed up in the mattress, or
hidden in your stocking. In other words, a civilized man saves money,
and the habit of storing globules of grease in the cells of his body is
a survival of an old instinct, and a needless strain upon his health.
Not merely does the fat man have to carry all the extra weight around
with him, but his body has to keep it and tend it; and what are the
effects of this is fully shown by life insurance tables. People who are
five or ten per cent over weight have five or ten per cent more chance
of dying all the time, while people who are five or ten per cent under
weight have five or ten per cent more than the average of life
expectation. There is no answer to these figures, which are the result
of the tabulation of many hundreds of thousands of cases. The meaning of
them to the fat person is to put himself on a diet of lean meat, green
vegetables and fresh fruits, until he has brought himself down, not
merely to the normal fatness of the civilized man, but to the normal
leanness of the athlete, the soldier on campaign, and the student who
has more important things to think about than stuffing his stomach.

There is, of course, a certain kind of leanness which is the result of
ill health. There are wasting diseases; tuberculosis, for example, and
anemia. There are people who worry themselves thin, and there are a few
rare "spiritual" people, so-called, who fade away from lack of
sufficient interest in their bodies. That is not the kind of leanness
that I mean, but the active, wiry leanness, which sometimes lives a
hundred years. Nearly always you will find that such people are spare
eaters; and you will find that our ideal of rosy plumpness, both for
adults and children, is a wholly false notion. We once had in our home
as servant an Irish girl, who was what is popularly called "a picture of
health," with those beautiful flaming cheeks that Irish and English
women so often have. She was in her early twenties, and nobody who knew
her had any idea but that her health was perfect. But one morning she
was discovered in bed with one side paralyzed, and in a couple of weeks
she was dead with erysipelas. The color in her cheeks had been nothing
but diseased blood vessels, overloaded with food material; and with the
blood in that condition, one of the tiny vessels in the brain had become
clogged.

In the same way I have seen children, two or three years old, plump and
rosy, and considered to be everything that children should be; but
pneumonia would hit them, and in two or three days they would be at
death's door. I do not mean that children should be kept hungry; on the
contrary, they should have four or five meals a day, so that they do not
have a chance to become too hungry. But at those meals they should eat
in great part the bulky foods, which contain the natural salts needed
for building the body. If a child asks for food, you may give it an
apple, or you may give it a slice of bread and butter with sugar on it.
The child will be equally well content in either case; but it is for
you, with your knowledge of food values, to realize that the bread with
butter and sugar contains two or three times as much nutriment as the
apple, but contains practically none of the precious organic salts which
will make the child's bones and teeth.

So far I have discussed this subject as if all foods grew on bushes
outside your kitchen door, and all you had to do was to go and pick off
what you wanted. But as a matter of fact, foods cost money, and under
our present system of wage slavery, the amount of money the average
person can spend for food is strictly limited. In a later book I am
going to discuss the problem of poverty, its causes and remedies. All
that I can do here is to tell you what foods you ought to have, and if
society does not pay you enough for your work to enable you to buy such
foods, you may know that society, is starving you, and you may get busy
to demand your rights as human beings. Meantime, however, such money as
you do have, you want to spend wisely, and the vast majority of you
spend it very unwisely indeed.

In the first place, a great many of the simplest and most wholesome
foods are cheap--often because people do not know enough to value them.
We insist upon having the choice cuts of meats, because they are more
tender to the teeth, but the cheaper cuts are exactly as nutritious. We
insist upon having our meats loaded with fat, although fatness is an
abnormal condition in an animal, and excess of fat is a grave error in
diet. I live in a country where jack rabbits are a pest, and in the
market they sell for perhaps one-fourth the cost of beef, and yet I can
hardly ever get them, because people value them so little as food; they
prefer the meat of a hog which has been wallowing in a filthy pen, and
has been deliberately made so fat that it could hardly walk!

I have already spoken of prunes, a much despised and invaluable food.
All the dried fruits are rich in food values, and if we could get them
untreated by chemicals, they would be worth their cost. I was brought up
to despise the cheaper vegetables, such as cabbage and turnips; I never
tasted boiled cabbage until I was forty, and then to my great surprise I
made the discovery that it is good. Raw cabbage is as valuable as any
other salad; it is a trifle harder to digest for some people, but I do
not believe in pampering the stomach. Both potatoes and rice are cheap
and wholesome, if only we would get unpolished rice, and if we would
leave the skins on the potatoes until after they are cooked. Nearly all
the mineral salts of the potato are just under the outer skin, and are
removed by the foolish habit of peeling them.

The prices of food differ so widely at different seasons and in
different parts of the world, that there is not much profit in trying to
figure how cheaply a person can live. I have found that I spend for the
diet I have indicated here, from sixty to eighty cents a day. I do not
buy any fancy foods, but on the other hand, I do not especially try to
economize; I buy what I want of the simple everyday foods in their
season. Most everyone will find that it is a good business proposition
to buy the foods which he needs to keep in health. If the average
workingman would add up the money he spends, not merely in the
restaurants, but in the candy stores, the drug stores, the tobacco
stores, and the offices of doctors and dentists, he would find, I think,
that he could afford to buy himself the necessary quantity of wholesome
natural foods. For a family of three, in the place where I live, enough
of these foods can be purchased for a dollar a day, and this is about
one-fourth what common labor is being paid, and one-eighth of what
skilled labor is being paid. I will specify the foods: a pound and a
half of shoulder steak, a loaf of whole wheat bread or a box of shredded
wheat biscuit, a head of cabbage, a pound of prunes, and four or five
pounds of apples.

There are many ways of saving in the purchase of food if you put your
