about the legs of the stove ; that a gentle bub- 
ble of water filled the room. 

She crawled, dripping, up, and made her way 
to the door. As she opened it, she let in a swash 
-about her ankles. 

She spattered across the entry to find the Irish 
woman who rented the other tenement ; she had 
gone, like the rest of the world, to see the flood, 
it seemed ; Catty received no answer to her
uncouth calls ; she was alone in the house. 

This disturbed her. She felt puzzled about 
the water ; alarmed, because she could neither see 
nor hear the reason of it ; annoyed at the cold 
crawling that it made about her ankles, and 
anxious for Sip to come and explain it. 

She went to the front door and opened that. 
A rush, like a tiny tide, met her. She stooped 
and put her hand out, over the step. It dipped 
into a pool of rising water. 

Catty shrank back and shut the door. The 
noise like wheels was plain to her. It waited for 
her outside of that door. It struck like claws 





upon her locked ears. It frightened her. She 
would not for the world open the door to it. She 
drew the bolt hard, in a childish fright, and sat 
down again in the slow gurgle on the kitchen 
floor. 

Suddenly it occurred to her that she might go 
and find Sip. But Sip would not be in the noise. 
Where would she be .'' 

Catty pushed herself along on the floor,
pushing out of the way of the water as she reflected. 
That was how another thing occurred to her. 

The farther that she pushed herself the thinner 
the gurgle grew. In the closet bedroom it was 
scarcely wet. 

At this side of the house she lost, or thought 
she lost, the noise. It must be at this side of the 
house that she should find Sip. Sip had often 
lost her out of the closet bedroom. She remem- 
bered, with a laugh, how many times she had 
climbed out of that little cupboard window after 
Sip was asleep. She felt her way to it eagerly. 
It was shut and buttoned. She pushed it, 
slamming, back, climbed to the high sill, and let
herself drop. 

Catty might have remained in the closet bed- 





room, had she but known it, high and dry. The 
stone house received a thorough soaking, but not 
a dangerous one. The water sucked in for a 
while at the locked front door, played drearily 
about the empty kitchen, mopped the entry floor, 
set the Irish woman's bread-pan and coal-hod 
afloat, and dawdled away again down the steps ; 
the result, it seemed, of a savage and transient 
shiver on the part of that fitful invalid, the river. 

The county bridge, in fact, was as good as 
gone. The transient shiver in the lower floods 
had been caused by the sinking of a pier. 

It had been a fine sight. Masses of men, women, 
and children hung, chained like galley-slaves, to 
either bank, intent and expectant on it. Foot 
and horse forsook the bridge. Police guarded it. 

A red sunset sprang up and stared at it. An 
avalanche of dead-white spray chewed the 
malachite and umber. Curious, lurid colors bounded 
up where they sank, and bruised and beat
themselves against the fallen and the falling piers. 

The gorgeous peril of the tinted water, and the 
gorgeous safety of the tinted sky, struck against 
each other fancifully. There seemed a rescue in 
the one for the ruin of the other. One was sure 





that the drowned colors held up their arms again, 
secure, inviolate, kindled, living, in the great 
resurrection of the watching heavens. 

It must have been not far from the moment 
when Catty dropped from the cupboard window, 
that, on the beautiful madness of the river, up 
where the baby souls of the cascades had 
transmigrated into camels, a long, low, brown streak 
appeared. 

It appeared at first sight to lie quite still. At 
second sight, it undulated heavily, like a huge 
boa. At the third, it coiled and plunged. 

" The logs ! The logs ! The logs are here ! " 

The cry ran round the banks. Maverick Hayle 
sat down on a stone and looked at his new mill 
stupidly. Passers cleared the railway crossing. 
People ran about and shouted. They climbed 
rocks and trees to look. The guards on the 
bridge disappeared. The smooth outlines of the 
boa grew jagged. The timber leaped and tan- 
gled in sweeping down. All through its wounded 
arches, the heavy bridge creaked and cried. 

The people on the banks cried too, from sheer 
excitement. 

" The logs, the logs, the logs ! The bridge ! " 





" Look on the bridge ! Look there ! Good 
God ! How did she get there ? On the bridge ! 
Woman on the bridge ! " 

Past the frightened guards, past the occupied 
eyes of a thousand people, on the bridge, over 
the bridge, not twelve feet from the sunken piers, 
stood a girl with low forehead, and dropping lip, 
and long, outstretching hands. 

" Catty ! Catty ! O Catty, Catty, Catty ! " 

The uncouth name rang with a terrible cry. 
It cleft the crowd like a knife. They parted 
before it, here and there and everywhere, letting a 
ghastly girl plunge through. 

"O Catty, Catty, Catty! For love's sake, 
stop ! For dear love's sake ! " 

It was too late for dear love to touch her. Its 
piteous call she could not hear. Its wrung face 
she could not see. Her poor, puzzled lips moved 
as if to argue with it, but made no sound. 

Type of the world from which she sprang, — 
the world of exhausted and corrupted body, of 
exhausted and corrupted brain, of exhausted and 
corrupted soul, the world of the laboring poor as 
man has made it, and as Christ has died for it, 
of a world deaf, dumb, blind, doomed, stepping 





confidently to its own destruction before our eyes, 
— Catty stood for a moment still, a little 
perplexed, it seemed, feeling about her patiently in 
the spray-sown, lighted air. 

One beck of a human hand would save her ; 
but she could not see it. One cry would turn 
her ; but her ears were sealed. 

Still, in the great dream of dying, as in the 
long dream of life, this miserable creature listened 
for what she never heard, and spoke that which 
no man understood. 

" She 's making signs to me," groaned Sip ; 
" she 's making signs to call my name ! " 

Then Perley Kelso put both arms about her. 
Then the solid shore staggered suddenly. Then 
a ragged shadow loomed across the dam. Then 
there was a shock, and thunder. 

Then some one covered her eyes, close. 

When she opened them, timber was tearing by. 
Spray was in her face. Dirk was beside her on 
his knees, and men had their hats off. 

On the empty ruin of the sliced bridge, two 
logs had caught and hung, black against the color 
of the water and the color of the sky. They 
had caught transversely, and hung like a cross. 







CHAPTER XIV. 

SWEPT AND GARNISHED. 

IT was Dirk who had covered Sip's eyes when 
the timber struck the bridge. 

She did not think of it at the time, but 
remembered it afterwards. 

She remembered it when he came that evening 
to the door of the lonely, sodden house, after Miss 
Kelso had gone, asking how she was, but refusing 
to enter lest, he said, he should be " one too 
many." She liked that. They did not want him 
— she and Catty — that night. This thing, in 
the solitude of the dripping house, had surprised 
her. God in heaven did not seem to have sep- 
arated her and Catty, after all. The silence of 
death was spared her. Catty's living love had 
made no sound ; her dead love made none 
either. A singular comfort came to Sip, almost 
with the striking of her sorrow. She and Catty 
could not be parted like two speaking people. 





Passed into the great world of signs, the deaf-mute, 
dead, grew grandly eloquent. The ring of the 
flood was her solemn kiss. The sunshine on the 
kitchen floor to-morrow would be her dear good- 
morning. Clouds and shadows and springing 
green gave her speech forever. The winds of 
long nights were language for her. Ah, the 
ways, the ways which Catty could find to speak 
to her ! 

Sip walked about the room with dry, burning 
eyes. She could not cry. She felt exultant, 
excited. The thing which she greatly feared had 
come upon her. The worst that ever could hurt 
her and Catty was over. And now how privileged
and rich she was ! What ways ! How 
many ways ! Only she and Catty knew. How 
glad she was now that Catty had never talked 
like other people ! 

This curious mood — if it should be called a 
mood — lasted, evenly, till the poor, disfigured 
heap found one day in the ebbing of the flood 
flung upright against a rock, a mile below the 
dam, with its long hands outstretched, spelling 
awful dumb words, had been brought to the 
stone house and carried away again, and left 





until the day when the lips of the dumb shall 
be unsealed, to spell its untranslated message 
through a tangle of myrtle into the smoky fac- 
tory air. 

After that she shrank suddenly, like a waked 
somnambulist, and went sick to bed. 

One day she got up and went to work again. 

That was the day that Dirk Burdock had 
watched for, had grown impatient about, seized 
impetuously when it came. 

It had been a pleasant day, with a grave sun- 
light and a quiet sky. Sip took a grave and 
pleasant face out into it. She wore a grave and 
pleasant smile when the young watchman's eager 
step overtook her, where the rusty boiler (made 
rustier than ever by the flood, and since re- 
moved) had stood beside the cotton-house. 

" I 'm glad to see you out again, Sip," said 
the young man, awkwardly, striding out of step 
with her, and falling back with a jerk. 

" Yes," said Sip, " it is quite time I should be 
at work again." . 

" It 's a pleasant day," said Dirk. 

"A very pleasant day," said Sip. 

" Been to see the new mill since the repairs ? " 
asked Dirk, as if struck by a bright 
thougiit. Now Dirk had vowed within himself, 
that, whatever else he said to Sip, he would say- 
nothing about the flood. He had an idea that it 
might make her cry. He had another, that it was 
about time for her to forget it. He had another 
still, somewhat to the effect that he was the man 
to make her forget. In the face of these three 
ideas. Dirk could have bitten his tongue out for 
his question. However, Sip did not cry, neither 
did she seem to have forgotten the flood, neither 
did she seem anxious to forget it or avoid it. 

She said, Yes, smiling, that she had walked by 
on her way to work this morning. There must 
have been a good deal of damage done .' 

" A sight," said Dirk, with a sigh of relief. 
" They say the young man lost the most out o' 
that affair." 

" Young Hayle ? " 

" Yes ; though they was all involved, I sup- 
pose, for that matter, — her among 'em. But she 
never bothered her head aboijt it at the time 
o' 't She was all taken up with — " 

" I know," Sip ran on, gently, when poor Dirk 
stuck in despair. " I do not think she thought of 





anything else but Catty and me. It was like her, 
— like her." 

" She must have lost," said Dirk, reviving 
again ; " I thought the fall lectures would be 
broke off, but it seems they ain't." 

Sip said nothing ; did not seem inclined to 
talk, and the two young people turned a couple 
of corners on the way to the stone house in 
thoughtful silence. They were almost too young 
to be so thoughtful and so silent ; more especially 
the young man, growing nervous, and taking 
furtive, anxious glances at the girl's face. 

It was an inscrutable face. 

Sip had shut her lips close ; she looked straight 
ahead ; the brown, dull tints of her cheeks and 
temples came out like a curtain, and folded all 
young colors and flushes and tremors, all hope 
and fear, all longing or purpose, need or fulness 
in her, out of sight. She only looked straight on 
and waited for Dirk to speak. 

She quite knew that and what he would speak. 
When he began, presently, with a quivering face, 
" Well, Sip, I don't see that I 'm getting on 
any in the mills, after all," she was neither 
surprised nor off her guard. She was not yet 





twenty-three, but she was too old to be put off her 
guard by a young man with a quivering face. If 
she had a thing to do, she meant to do it ; put 
her hands together in that way she had, bent at 
the knuckles, resolutely. 

" No," she said, " no ; you 'll never get any 
farther. Dirk." 

" But I meant to," said Dirk, hotly. " I thought 
I should ! Mebbe you think it 's me that 's the 
trouble, not the getting on ! " 

" Perhaps there is a trouble about you," said 
Sip, honestly ; " I don't know ; and I don't much 
care whether there is or not. But I think most of 
the trouble is in the getting on. Mills ain't made 
to get on in. It ain't easy, I know. Dirk. It 
ain't. It 's the staying put of 'em, that 's the 
worst of 'em. Doiit I know? It's the staying 
put that 's the matter with most o' folks in the 
world, it seems to me. For we are the most o' 
folks, — us that stay put, you know." 

" Are we ? " said Dirk, a little puzzled by Sip's 
social speculations. " But I 'm getting steady 
pay now. Sip, at any rate ; and I 've a steady 
chance. Garrick 's a friend o' mine, I believe, 
and has showed himself friendly. He 'll keep me 





the watch, at least, — Mr. Garrick. I might be 
worse off than on watch. Sip." 

" O yes," said Sip ; " you 've got a good place, 
Dirk." 

" With a chance," repeated Dirk. 

" With a chance ? Maybe," answered Sip. 

"And now," said Dirk, trembling suddenly, 
" what with the place and the chance — maybe, 
and the pay and the steadiness, sure, I 've been 
thinking, Sip, as the time had come to ask 
you — " 

" Don't ! " said Sip. 

All young colors and flushes and tremors, 
hopes and fears, longing and need, broke now 
out of the brown curtain of Sip's face. In the 
instant she was a very lonely, very miserable 
little girl, not by any means over twenty-three, 
and the young man had eyes of cruelly kind ! 
But she said : " Don't, Dirk ! O please, don't ! " 

" Well ! " said Dirk. He stopped and drew 
breath as if she had shot him. 

They had come to the stone house now, and 
Sip began walking back and forth in front of it. 

"But I was going to ask you to be my wife ! " 
said Dirk. " It 's so long that I haven't dared 





to ask you, and now you say don't ! Don't ? But 
I will ; I 'll ask at any rate. Sip, will you marry 
me ? There ! I should choke if I didn't ask. 
You may say what you please." 

" I can't say what I please," said Sip, in a low 
voice, walking faster. 

" I don't know what 's to hinder," said Dirk, 
in an injured tone ; " I always knew I wasn't 
half fit for you, and I always knew you 'd ought 
to have a man that could get on. But consider- 
ing the steadiness and the chance, and that I — 
I set such a sight by you. Sip, and sometimes 
I've thought you — liked me well enough," 
concluded Dirk, candidly. 

" I like you. Dirk," said Sip, slowly, " well 
enough." 

".Well enough to be my wife .' " 

" Well enougl* to be your wife." 

" Then I shouldn't think," observed Dirk, simply, 
and with a brightening face, "that you'd 
find it very hard saying what you please." 

" Maybe I shouldn't," said Sip, " if I could be 
your wife ; but I can't." 

Her bent hands fell apart weakly ; she did not 
look at Dirk ; she fixed her eyes on a little clump 





of dock-weed at her feet, beside the fence ; she 
looked sick and faint. 

" I 'II not marry you," said the girl feebly ; " I 'll 
not marry anybody. Maybe it isn't the way a 
girl had ought to feel when she likes a young 
fellow," added Sip, with a kind of patient aged bitterness 
crawling into her eyes. " But we don't 
live down here so 's to make girls grow up like 
girls should, it seems to me. Things as would 
n't trouble rich folks troubles us. There 's things 
that troubles me. I 'll never marry anybody. 
Dirk. I 'll never bring a child into the world to 
work in the mills ; and if I 'd ought not to say it, 
I can't help it, for it 's the truth, and the reason, 
and I 've said it to God on my knees a many and 
a many times. I 've said it before Catty died, and 
I 've said it more than ever since, and I 'll say 
it till I die. I 'll never bring children into this 
world to be factory children, and to be factory 
boys and girls, and to be factory men and women, 
and to see the sights I 've seen, and to bear the 
things I 've borne, and to run the risks I 've run, 
and to grow up as I 've grown up, and to stop 
where I 've stopped, — never. I 've heard tell 
of slaves before the war that wouldn't be fathers 





and mothers of children to be slaves like them. 
That 's the way I feel, and that 's the way I mean 
to feel. I won't be the mother of a child to go 
and live my life over again. I 'll never marry 
anybody." 

" But they needn't be factory people," urged 
Dirk, with a mystified face. " There 's trades and 
— other things." 

" I know, I know," Sip shook her head, — "I 
know all about that. They 'd never get out of 
the mills. It 's from generation to generation. It 
couldn't be helped. I know. It 's in the blood." 

" But other folks don't take it so," urged Dirk, 
after a disconsolate pause. "Other folks marry, 
and have their homes and the comfort of 'em. 
Other folks, if they love a man, 'll be his wife 
someways or nuther.'' 

" Sometimes," said Sip, " I seem to think that 
that I 'm not other folks. Things come to me 
someways that other folks don't understand nor 
care for." She crushed the dock-weed to a 
wounded mass, and dug her foot into the ground, 
and stamped upon it. 

" I 've made up my mind, Dirk. It 's no use 
talking. It — it hurts me," with a tender motion of 





the restless foot against the bruised, rough leaves 
of the weed which she was covering up with sand. 
" I 'd rather not talk any more, Dirk. There 's 
other girls. Some other girl will do." 

" I 'll have no other girl if I can't have you ! " 
said poor Dirk, turning away. " I never could 
set such a sight by another girl as I 've set by 
you. If you don't marry. Sip, no more 'U L" 

Sip smiled, but did not speak. 

" Upon my word, I won't ! " cried Dirk. " You 
think I 'm one of other folks, I guess. You wait 
and see. I 've loved you true. If ever man 
loved a girl, I 've loved you true. If I can't 
have you, I 'll have nobody ! " 

But Sip only smiled. 

She went into the house after Dirk had gone, 
weakly. The flushing tremors in her face had 
set into a dead color, and her hands came to- 
gether again at the knuckles. 

The Irish woman was away, and the house was 
lonely and still. The kitchen fire was out. She 
went out into the little shed for kindlings, think- 
ing that she would make a cup of tea directly, 
she felt so weak. 

When she got there, she sat down on the 



chopping-block, and covered her face, her feet 
hanging listlessly against the axe. She wished 
that: she need never lift her head nor look about 
again. She wished that when the Irish woman 
came home- she should just step into the little 
shed -and :find her dead. What a close little 
wajrriv sheltered- shed it was !• All the world out- 
siiJe of it seemed emptied, swept, and garnished. 
She felt as if her-life bad just been through a 
" house-cleaning." - It was clean and washed, and 
proper and right, and as it should be, and drearily 
in-order forever.  Now it was'time to sit down in it. 

Sip had -what- Mr. Mill- calls a "large share of 
human nature," and she loved Dirk, and she led 
a lonely life. She was neither a heroiiie, nor a 
saint, nor a fanatic, sitting: out -there' iti  the little 
wood-shed on the chopping-block, 

"I don't see why I could nJt.' have had that, 
leastways," she cried between her hands; . " I 
haven't ever had much else. I don't see why 
that should go tooV 

But she did see. In about ten mintttes she 
saw clearly enough to get up from the chapping- 
block, and go in and make her cup of tea. 







CHAPTER XV. 

A PREACHER AND A SERMON. 

O HE saw clearly enough in time to be a very 
happy woman. 

Perley Kelso, at least, was thinking so, when 
she went the. other day with young Mrs. Hayle 
to hear one of her street sermons. 

Sip had " set up for a preacher," after all ; 
she hardly kriew how ; nobody knew exactly how ; 
it had come about, happened ; taken rather the 
form of a destiny than a plan. 

The change had fallen upon her since Catty's 
passing " out of sight." She was apt to speak of 
Catty so. She was not dead nor lost. She lis- 
tened still arid spoke. She only could not see 
her. 

" But she talks," said Sip under her breath, — 
"she talks to me. There's things she 'd have me 
say. That was how I first went to the meetings. 
I 'd never cared about meetings. I'd never been 





religious nor good. But Catty had such things 
to say ! and when I saw the people's faces, lifted 
up and listening, and when I talked and talked, 
it all came to me one night like this. Do you 
see ? Like this. I was up to the Mission reading 
a little hymn I know, and the lights were on the 
people's faces, and in a minute it was like this. 
God had things to say. I 'd been talking Catty's 
words. God had words. I cannot tell you how 
it was ; but I stood right up and said them ; and 
ever since there 's been more than I could say." 

" What is there about the girl that can attract 
so many people ? " asked Mrs. Maverick Hayle, 
standing on tiptoe beside Perley on the outer edge 
of Sip's audience, and turning her wide eyes on it, 
like a child at a menagerie. " There are old men 
here, and old women. There's everybody here. 
The girl looks too young to instruct them." 

She must judge for herself what there was 
about her, Miss Kelso said ; it had been always 
so ; since she started her first neighborhood 
meeting in the Irish woman's kitchen at the stone 
house, she had found listeners enough ; they were 
too many for tenement accommodations after a 
while, and so the thing grew. 





Sometimes she used the chapel. Sometimes 
she preferred a doorstep like this, and the open 
air. 

" I undertook to help her at the first," said 
Miss Kelso, smiling, " but I was only among them 
at best ; Sip is of them ; she understands them 
and they understand her ; so I left her to her 
work, and I keep to my own. Hush ! Here she 
is ; can you see ? Just over there on the upper 
step.'' 

They were in a little court, a miserable place, 
breaking out like a wart from one of the foulest
