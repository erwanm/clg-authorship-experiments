'What is it, kiddie?'" 

Anything like the warm delight of her face he had not seen. 
It came upon him that two most blessed things had happened : 
Bess adored him " beyond beyond," and the little game had 
snatched her at one leap out of her lonesomeness. 

" Is Celia — " she began. 

He shook his head. 

" No. I 've got just one only kid. Celia mustn't even 
know it. Good-night, kiddie." 

He spoke the word in the merest whisper, a moving of the 
lips. 

" Good-night," she said. 

When she was at the door he waved a hand to her. His 
eyes felt hot. So slight a thing had changed her into the gay 
and glowing creature youth should be. Then he sat there a 
long time, not with his book but his inmost self. He had be- 
gun to wonder whether it had all got to begin again, the thing

he hated so he thought he had got rid of it — what he called 
responsibility. For he had known in his soul for a long time 
that when he said he was leaving the world that he might 
translate Theocritus, he had been leaving it because he 
thought the world and he might very well do without each 
other. But now the burdens — none of them tragic, but little 
parcels you might bring home from market — were piling on 
his back. There was no peace save in the upper sky, and 
there you couldn't breathe. 



 



XVII 

BEFORE dawn Bess heard a tapping at her door. She 
thought she was in the tavern, called, while the kind- 
liness of sleep engulfed her, to speed some drummer 
on his way. 

" In a minute," said she, while she set her feet, tranced like 
the rest of her, on the floor and put her hands to her shut 
eyes. But the knockings continued, at little nervous intervals ; 
and they, the character of them and the look of her room, 
told her she was in this new phase of life where heaven alone 
knew what eccentric needs would summon her. 

She went to the door, and there Catherine in her night- 
gown stood shuddering with recurrent spasms. Her face had 
a blank, draggled pallor as if she had scarcely slept, and her 
eyes were staring. The years, almost eflaced by day when 
she called upon the framing of pretty gowns and exquisite 
toilet arts to help her, were here, straggling their marks all 
over her face, the pathetic map of life. 

" I 'm afraid," she said. 

Bess for an instant stood looking at her, wondering whether 
to snatch her into her own warm bed ; but that seemed a 
liberty toward a lady who was, to her humility, unap- 
proachable. So she put an arm about her sofdy, yet with 
determination, and turned with her toward Catherine's 
chamber. 

" It 's early," she said. " You come back to bed." 

" Don't wake Celia," Catherine whispered as they passed 
Celia's door. " Don't wake him." 

When she was in her bed, and Bess had drawn up a 



 





blanket to shield her from the cold of dawn, she lay with 
her eyes fixed solemnly on the girl and said again, — 

" I 'm afraid." 

" You lie still," said Bess. " I 'm going to get you some- 
thing." 

Catherine's eyes seemed to beseech her not to go, but Bess, 
with her air of knowing what errands she had to do, had 
walked out of the room. Catherine heard her hastening down 
the stairs. In ten minutes, perhaps, she was back with a cup 
of hot milk, and Catherine shook her head on the pillow. 

" I don't want that," she said. 

Bess only slipped an arm under her. 

" You need something inside you," she stated, and put the 
cup to her lips. 

So Catherine drank, but as she lay back, she said again, 
as if unmoved in a conviction, — 

« I 'm afraid." 

Bess had run her arnis into a wrapper, and now she sat 
down, the yellow folds of it falling beautifully about her. 

"Aren't you surprised?" Catherine interrogated her. 
" Did you ever see a grown-up woman afraid ? " 

"Yes," said Bess, beginning to plait the curling ends of 
her brown braid. " You go to sleep now, and I'll sit here. 
When you wake up, you won't be afraid." 

"Yes, I shall," said Catherine. " I haven't slept all night. 
Why should you think I can sleep now? " 

" Did you say your prayers ? " asked Bess, with simplicity. 

The unheard-of challenge startled Catherine out of her 
panic, to pure wonder. 

" What makes you ask that? " she queried. 

" I thought maybe you 'd better say 'em now," said Bess 
with the same air of referring the matter to an ordinary 
remedy. "That 'sail." 



 





" Do you say your prayers?'' Catherine countered. 

"Yes." 

" I didn't know you were a churchwoman." Human curi- 
osity and hot milk were working a momentary wholesome 
change in her. 

" I don't go to meeting very often," said Bess. " I don't 
care much about it." 

" Then what prayers do you say ? " 

" I say ' Now I lay me.' That 's all I know." 

Catherine simply stared at her. But Bess had put her head 
back against the grandfather chair and closed her eyes. The 
lashes were very thick and long. Perhaps her broken lethargy 
was returning upon her; it might be she was willing to lull 
Catherine by a good example. Catherine watched her for a 
while in a jealous questioning. She could not help wonder- 
ing how it would seem to have such a velvet surface and such 
curves of the upper lip. How would it feel to be so singularly 
endowed that John Winterbourne could say, " She is as im- 
mediate to me as my own hand " ? Yet it had to be accepted 
that Bess was, in the nature of her, essential to her also, in 
her need. She had a pained sense of the girl's triumphing 
youth and some peculiar quality that made her at one with life. 
It hurt her inconceivably to see her husband turning, though 
so unconsciously and with such honest clarity, to that whole- 
some serviceableness ; yet it had bred in her no rancor against 
Bess. And here, in her own extremity, she also was seeking 
her, because Bess mysteriously had help and would give it. 

With the light and perhaps the consciousness of scrutiny, 
Bess awoke and seemed to gather in the situation anew. 
Then she smiled down at Catherine slightly but most natu- 
rally, as if difficulties gave her an especial pleasure. 

"You lie still," she said. " I 'm going to dress me, and then 
I'll bring your breakfast." 



 





" No," said Catherine perversely, the idea of requiring ex- 
traordinary service suddenly, now it was stated, repugnant to 
her. " Send Lyddy." But this was knowing Lyddy would 
not come. 

" You lie still," said Bess again. " I 'm going to dress 
me. 

A little later, for she was always to the fore with break- 
fast, lest Lyddy had foundered by the way, and this morn- 
ing there was no time for dallying and choosing among crisp 
prettinesses, she was in the kitchen, and Lyddy, loosely drift- 
ing back and forth on her efficient errands between table and 
stove, turned to look with sardonic disapproval at the little 
tray she was making comely. 

"Cat's foot!" said Lyddy. "Who's got the pip? You 
better by half set down here an' eat your own breakfast. 
Fever de lurks, that's what's up chamber — two stomachs 
to eat an' nary one to work." 

But Bess was absorbed. She needn't answer, because 
Lyddy was now hers without conciliation. She carried up the 
tray and packed Catherine about with pillows, so engrossed 
in swift efficiency that there was no use in checking her. She 
caused the breakfast to be eaten, and then put the patient 
back again into her nest and adjured her with authority to 
stay there until she should come again. Then, having car- 
ried down the tray and eaten her own breakfast, she looked 
about for Winterbourne and spied him in the back garden, 
where he was surveying the world with the air of one who 
meant presently to do something in it. 

Winterbourne had had his morning smoke, which was not 
actually the same as his after-breakfast one ; and because the 
earth looked kindly to him, he was about to take out his pipe 
to add one zest more. To him appeared Bess, bareheaded, 
and comely as the morning. She seemed to furnish another 



 





reason. But her first address stopped his hand midway in the 
quest for his tobacco-pouch. 

" Your wife 's broken down," said she briefly. 

He stared at her, and she repeated it. 

" Broken down ? " Winterbourne questioned. " Don't talk 
as if she was a shay." 

That was Greek to her, and again she made her statement, 
unaltered. 

" How do you know ? " Winterbourne inquired. " Did she 
tell you?" 

" No, sir, but I 've seen her and she says she 's afraid." 

"Afraid of what?" 

" I don't know, sir. But she is, and that's the way they 
are sometimes." 

"Why, you preternaturally wise young simpleton, you 
babe and suckling," he interrogated her, yet struck so palpably 
by her solemn assertiveness that he tucked the pouch back 
into his pocket and kept only the pipe for company, " where 
did you learn to be a medical man? Was Hippocrates your 
uncle ? How 's old Galen ? " 

" I don't know them, sir," said Bess, more rapidly and still 
cogently because she thought Catherine might be wanting 
her. " But I 've seen a good many ladies just like this. They 
break down, ladies do." 

"Where did you see 'em, Hop-o'-my-Thumb ? " 

"One season I worked in the sanatorium, the year there 
was the fire in the tavern and we had to shut down. They 
came to get ozone." She spoke as if it might be something 
from the bargain-counter. 

"What's ozone?" Winterbourne asked, his eyes all 
points of fun and the crinkles about them interlacing. 

" I don't know, sir, but they said it was there and the ladies 
came to get it." 



 





" Did you like being there, you trumpery barmaid, mix- 
ing your ozone and serving it out by the glass ? '' 

"Not very well. But what I was going to say — " 

"Why didn't you like it?" 

She answered now to the point, seeing there was no switch- 
ing him off until that issue was put by. 

" There was a good deal of complaint. They were pretty 
nervous. And they wanted to give you fees." 

" Wanted to give me fees ? " 

"Me, sir. When I did things for 'em." 

" Did you like that, Bess? " 

The brown eyes opened on him in a mild surprise. 

"Why, I didn't take 'em, sir. I had my regular wages." 

Winterbourne slapped his leg and crowed. 

" Athena, listen to her ! " he adjured the upper air. " She 's 
your own girl. Why didn't you take 'em?" 

She was getting impatient now, her errand all undone. 

" Why, sir, I told you. I had my regular wages. But what 
I was going to say, if you send for the doctor, he'll tell her 
she 's got to lie still maybe for a year." 

So vividly was last night present to Winterbourne's con- 
sciousness that he might have been forgiven if his mind, that 
errant servitor, suggested, in a burst of reckless comment, 
that it did not in the least shrink from such a prospect. But 
what he said was, — 

"Good God 1" 

" So I thought if maybe you 'd just encourage her to lie 
abed mornings and then get up and kind of take her mind 
off herself — why, that would be the best. There's no need 
of their lying abed a year, sir. It does 'em harm in the end." 

She looked so earnest with her calm eyes fixed upon him 
in the convincingness of her part, so sweet all through with 
her hair blowing about her pretty face, that, in spite of the 



 





mysterious ill-fortune that had befallen his wife, Winter- 
bourne could have burst out into great laughter. Bess always 
affected him so, in a differing ratio. Sometimes he wanted to 
laugh at her, she was so queer, sometimes tenderly, she was 
such a little fool. But she always challenged mirth. 

" I 'm going in now," she said. " You encourage her.'' 

" Where 's Celia? Has she got cracked or frayed or broken 
since I saw her yesterday?" 

"She's sleeping late. There's Tonty, Mr. Winterbourne. 
I guess she's looking for you." 

Tonty was coming wandering out at the back door by 
which Lyddy had sent her to find Jackie. She looked like 
a little girl out of a good book, with the long hair she had 
painstakingly curled in the habit of an older time, — because 
mother's hair in the picture was curled just so, — and a large 
hat in her hand. Her dear little face, with its pointed chin, 
had its usual gravity, and it was apparent she had come to 
deliver a message. 

" Jackie," she said. 

"What say. Dame Partlet?" Winterbourne responded, 
making her a bow. That she liked. He did it so gravely there 
was no derision in it. 

" Mother said I was to tell you she had broken down." 

Winterbourne looked at Bess. There was terror in his 
glance. 

"Is this a world-wide calamity?" he inquired of her. 
" Are ladies falling in fragments about us ? " 

Bess was paying no attention to him. This was her pro- 
vince. He was the helpless male. 

" Where is mother ? " she asked Tonty confidentially. 

"In bed with a lot of papers. She 's broken down." 

"It's no use, Bess," said Winterbourne. "It's no man- 
ner of use. I shall be daflfy if I hear any more of these things. 



 





You take Tonty in and give her some lemon-pic or some- 
thing, and I'll go clamming." 

Tonty brightened at the reference to lemon-pie, but Bess 
had taken her hand. 

" I'll go back with her," she said. " Come, Tonty. I 'm 
going to see mother." 

That struck Tonty as being unnecessary, apparently, until 
she had the lemon-pie, and she looked back, wistful and re- 
mindingly at Jackie who had prescribed it. He watched them 
away, but when they were outside the gate he followed with 
a couple of strides. 

" Didn't mother say anything more, Tonty ? " he be- 
sought. 

" No. She said I was to tell you she 'd broken down." 

Winterbourne stood there in the road and watched them 
away. He knew he ought to go in and see Catherine, — 
the shards of her, at least, — but he was afraid to. And why 
— why — his dazed intelligence asked him, if Anna Clayton 
Ramsay had flown into a million pieces did she send the 
news of it to him like the message of ill to Cleopatra ? 

" It 's my damned good-nature," he grumbled. 

Then he thought for a moment of the duties of life and 
how, wearisome as they were, he meant to tackle them, and 
at the same minute saw Dwight Hunter in his ample cart 
driving off for sea-weed. 

" Hi ! " said Winterbourne. 

Hunter stopped, and Winterbourne mounted beside him 
and drove off into the shining day, as care-free as a boy 
going swimming against orders. But he did not drive so 
irretrievably far that conscience was drugged indeed. In the 
midst of a psean from Dwight about the old furniture that 
went for a song down the valley yesterday, he heaved a sigh. 

" Draw up, Dwight," he bade him. " I 've got to get out." 



 





" Forgot something? '' asked Hunter, doing it. 

" Yes. Forgot my manners, forgot my decency. Good- 
by, old man." 

Then Dwight drove on, and Winterbourne betook him- 
self, muttering, along the road to Mrs. Ramsay's. 

Tonty could not be persuaded to talk when she and Bess 
set forth, and so Bess gave up the task of setting her at ease, 
and they went on together in the silence that is sometimes 
ease itself. Tonty's little heart instantly felt lighter. She 
found it quite difficult to converse except with Jackie, and 
it seemed to her a beautiful lady who went along humming 
and showed no interest in her going to school or her taste in 
kittens. At the front door three other little figures were in 
line to meet them, — Tony with a tier buttoned, in defiance 
of its nature, in front, — this because, in the family troubles 
of the morning, he had manfully dressed himself. Tonty 
noted that badge of haste and waved a hand to him, a signal 
to hide himself behind the more properly apparelled ; but 
Tony stood still with his hand on the hoe-handle which was 
this morning his comforter, and Bess with her little guide 
passed them and went on to Mrs. Ramsay's room. 

It was a big room in the front of the house, with dark fur- 
niture of the wrong period, of a large uncouthness and much 
be-knobbed. The great bed had been slept in, and the circu- 
lar untidy nest of its occupant showed that she had not gone 
through the rite of opening it to the air. Bess, seeing this 
lair of the escaped lady, was about to ask Tonty where they 
should look for her next, when there on a sofa, the floor 
under it stuffed with papers, her bonnet on and unhappily 
askew, they saw her. One glove even was on. Her bag, dis- 
gorging papers, was at her side slumped under one arm. 

Bess on the way to her had time to feel that the room 
was a chaos of papers and that it ought to be cleared out. 



 





There were papers on the table, a package on the wash- 
stand even between bowl and pitcher, and a ragged-edged 
pile of them along one wall, these yellowed from long life, 
the folds brown with dust. Bess, who had done a great deal 
of cleaning in her short day, could have told you what a 
sneezy job it would have been to reorganize that treasured 
litter. It was almost possible to wonder how one could have 
slept in the room on a breezy night with the window open, 
for the rustling of so much disengaged matter of leaves. 
When Bess stood at her side, Mrs. Ramsay opened her eyes. 

" Go away, Tonty," she said distinctly, and Tonty, with 
a fear upon her, went. " There 's no reason why the child 
should be frightened," Mrs. Ramsay continued, shutting her 
eyes again after a recognizing look at Bess. " Fear is the one 
tyrant." 

Bess, with an instinct that she must look too tall for 
kindness to the prostrate figure on the sofa, drew up a chair, 
itself the repository of papers, and placed herself on the edge 
of it, not invading their sovereignty. 

"I sent for Mr. Winterbourne," said Mrs. Ramsay. She 
spoke with a deliberate care that evidently cost her a good 
deal. " I wanted to tell him my son — I can't remember his 
name — " 

"Tim?" 

" I think so. My son has gone to the city this morning 
with — I can't remember the name."

"With his father?" 

" With something that belongs to Mr. Winterbourne. I 
can remember Mr. Winterbourne's name. Why can't I re- 
member the names I can't remember ? " 

" You 'd better stop trying. You 'd better go to sleep," 
said Bess, snatching for a comparison, out of her serviceable 
memory of the lady at the sanatorium who couldn't find the 



 





names of things she wanted, and was forced to decline upon 
makeshifts until she had become sufficiently heartened on 
ozone to begin words over again. 

But Mrs, Ramsay was paying no attention to hygienic 
promptings. 

" The thing my son has carried is very important to Mr. 
Winterbourne — " she asserted. " What do you think it 
could be?" 

" If it 's anything he 's borrowed," Bess ventured at ran- 
dom, " he'll return it all right." 

" No, it 's not that. He hasn't borrowed it. He has — " 
Her brows contracted over the memory of some past shock 
or trouble. " What do you think it could be ? A nutmeg- 
grater? Is that it? Is it black-silk mitts ? Does that sound 
right to you ? " 

Bess, in time of sick minds, could invent gloriously and 
swear to the invention of anybody else. 

" Either of 'em would do," she assured Mrs. Ramsay. 
" You shut your eyes now. I'll tell him." 

" Tell him something must be done," Mrs. Ramsay ad- 
jured her. " If he doesn't look out, the circingle will be 
sold." And then she did shut her eyes, and Bess might 
have thought she was resting except for her knitted brows 
and the moving of her mouth. 

Bess got softly out of her chair, and Mrs. Ramsay opened 
her eyes at the rustle, and said clearly, — 

" There 's one thing more. I want to tell you why I am 
sure I 've broken down. You don't notice it, of course, 
but I can't remember. When I try to remember a word, it 
looks like an ink-eraser — the kind with the band round the 
middle." 

" I'll get you a glass of water," said Bess. 

She went downstairs to the kitchen, where the little maid. 



 





like one impelled upon a mission imperfectly understood 
but acquiesced in, was washing dishes with the air of having 
done it ever since Bess had seen her last. No, she didn't 
know anything about Mrs. Ramsay's not feeling well. Mrs. 
Ramsay 'd had her breakfast with her bonnet on, same as 
she always did, to take the eight-thirteen. She didn't see 
her go out, but then she was busy washing the dishes. No, 
she guessed Mary wasn't coming back to cook. Mary 'd had 
a dreadful time with her liver and her tubes going on a year 
now. She said she 'd have left long ago if it hadn't been for 
the children. So Bess went back home with her budget of 
news, and met Winterbourne by the way. 

" Well ? " said he, standing still under the big ash tree 
while she also paused. " Well, Atlas, what do you make 
of it?" 

The name puzzled her, — why should she be called a 
school book ? — but she couldn't stop for that. 

" It 's true what Tonty said," she told him, with unmoved 
directness. " Her mother's broken down." 

Winterbourne stood looking at her for a full minute 
while she met his gaze as squarely, her own only seeming to 
ask him if he wanted to know anything more. 

" Bess," said he, " have you by accident a sense of humor 
about you ? " 

"What, sir?" 

" Could you roll on the ground and scream, if you weren't 
afraid of mussing your frock, because this old world 's so 
funny ? Or does it seem to you a perfectly natural and simple 
thing for two ladies in one morning to announce that they've 
broken down? Speak up, Oracle. I 've got to know." 

" I suppose they might as well break down the same 
morning as different mornings," said Bess practically. " It 's 
just something that happens to you, same as a cold would 



 





be. Lots of folks have colds the same day. Mr. Winter- 
bourne, do you think the Ramsays have any money ? " 

" I think they 're poor as barley soup. I think Ramsay'll 
blow the top of his head off some day, if he ever sits down 
to consider how he 's going to provide for his children and 
his wife and his old waterlogged craft." 

" Then, Mr. Winterbourne," said Bess, with a resolution 
she had evidently no least thought of his gainsaying, " we 've 
got to take Mrs. Ramsay over to your house for a month or 
so, till we see how it 's going to turn." 

"Take Anna Clayton Ramsay into my house?" he pelted 
at her. "You young basilisk, do you know what you're 
saying?" 

"It's all the way I see," she remarked, also, it was evi- 
dent, sending her mind skirmishing about to guess whether 
there might not indeed prove to be expedients that pleased 
him better. " Then that little Harriet could take some care 
of the children, and I could take care of Mrs. Ramsay and 
your wife, same time." 

" My father Jupiter! " Winterbourne broke out. He took 
off his hat and looked up into the clear sky. "Artemis, do 
you hear? Cytherea, here is a maiden that ought to belong
