which were evidently not supplied by the dentist, 

" Have you made out my bill ? " 

" Here it is."  

"While I am looking over it, will yon pick out such 
clothes as the boy will need?" 

Parting a hasty glance at Charlie, to make sure of his 
size, the dealer hurried to the rear of the shop, and commenced selecting articles which he laid away in a small 
blue chest. 

This task was soon completed, and again he came out 
to the front part of the store. 

" All ready I " he said, in a low voice to Randall. 

" You have been quick. Here is the amount of your 



 


bill. As to the chest, you may send it on board the 
Booncing Betsy without any unnecessary delay." 

" It shall be done, Mr. Randall. Have you no further 
commands for us ? '' 

" I beliere.not, to-day." 

" You will remember our shop when you are round 
again?" 

" I won't forget you." 

'' You needn't accompany me to tjie door, nor allude 
to my voyage," said Randall, in a low voice, to the 
dealer. " Remember, I have Mm with me." 

Moses winked m a manner which by no means improved the expression of his not very agreeable features. 

" Now, my lad," said Randall, " we'll go on board the 
vessel. Have you ever been on board a ship ? " 

" Yes, sir, a good many times by myself, but I never 
had any one to tell me the different parts." 

" I'll promise, then," said the mate, in a tone whose 
signficance was lost upon our hero at the time, though 
he afterwards recalled it, " that you shall know mcffe 
about a vessel before you leave this onfe." 

" I thank you," said Charlie, considering the offer a 
kind one. 

They ascended the ladder and jumped upon the deck 
of the vessel, which, though Charlie knew it not, was to 
be his home for many a weary day. 




At the close of the last chapter we had got our hero 
fairly on board the Bouncing Betsey, on what he sup- 
posed to be a brief visit, but which his companion had 
resolved should be far otherwise. 

Randall did not at first undeceive his youthful attend. 
ant. He felt that it would hardly be polite, as the ship 
was lying at the wharf surrounded by ottier vessels, and 
the disturbance and vigorous resistance which Charlie 
would be apt to make when told what was in store for 
him might attract a degree of attention which might 
prove fatarto his plans.   

They had scarcely set their feet upon deck, when they 
encountered Capt. Brace. 

The mate glanced significantly at the boy by his side, 
and carelessly put his finger to his lips in token of si- 
lence, at the same time saying, "A lad whom I have 
promised to initiate into some of the mysteries of sea- 
manship." 

''He may find the knowledge usefhl to him some 
time," said the captain, with a grim smile. " Do you 
think you should like going to sea, my lad? ' 

" No, sir," returned Charlie, promptly, " I don't 
think I should." 

 

"Why not?" 

' I should get tired of seeing the sea all the time." 

" You would get used to it." 

" I never should like it so well as the land. Besides, 
I should not like to leave my mother." 

'.' Well, my lad, if you should ever change your 
mind," said the captain, with a wicked glance at Ran- 
dall, "I hope you'U give me the first offer of your 
services." .  

" Yes, sir," said our hero, thinking the captain very 
affable and polite, though, to be sure, his appearance 
was hardly as prepossessing as it might have been. 

" The. captain seems to be a very nice man," said he 
to Randall, after that officer had left them. 

" Oh, yes," answered Randall, dryly, " a Tery fine 
man the captain is. Fm glad you like him." 

"Have you been to sea a long time?" inquired 
Charlie: 

" Yes, I have been ever since I was a boy." 

"D >youlikeit?" 

"Very much. It seems like home to me now. I 
shouldn't be willing to live on land for any length of 
time." 

" Did you begin very young? " 

" I was about sixteen. How old are you? " 

" Almost fourteen. I shall be fourteen next month." 

" You are a very -good size for your age." 

"Yes," said Charlie, with boyish pride, drawing him- 
self up to his f\ill height. Like most boys, he liked to 
be told he was large of his age. _ 

 ' My fkther was quite a large man," added our young 
hero.  



 



 

"I know it,himself, as the 
handsome face and manly form of the father rose before 
him. They were imprinted more vividly upon his memory, because he felt that it was these very advantages 
which had enabled his rival to succeed in winning the 
prize for which he had vainly contended. 

"Did you speak?" said Charlie, hearing indistinctly 
the words which his companion muttered. 

"No," said Randall, shortly. "But I promised to 
show you something about the vessel. I suppose you 
know the names of the masts." 

" Yes, sir." 

" What do they call this ? " 

'' This is the main-mast," answered Charlie, promptly, 
"and the others are called the foremast and mizzen-' 
mast." 

" That is right ; I suppose the masts seem high to 
you." 

" Yes, very high," said Charlie, stretching his neck to 
enable him to see the top.  

" Then you don't think you should like to go aloft?" 
said Randall, playing with him as a cat plays with a 
mouse. 

" I don't believe I could. It would make me dizzy." 

" You could do better than you think for, if you were 
obliged to."- 

"Perhaps I might," said Charlie, doubtfhlly. "Do 
the boys on board ship have to go up there?" 

" I had to when I was a boy." 

"Wer'n't you afraid?" 

"I suppose I was, but that didn't do any good, — I 
had to go." 

 

" Wer'n't you afraid of losing your hold? " 

" Yes, but it isn't often a boy loses his hold going up 
the fii'st time. He is so frightened that he clings to the 
ropes with a pretty tight grip. But after he gets used 
to it — and it doesn't seem any worse than going up 
stairs — he is apt to grow careless, and then there is 
sometimes an accident." 

'' Then I suppose they fall on deck and are instantly 
killed," said Charlie, shuddering. 

" Not always, for when the ship is in progress it leans 
a good deal, so that they are more likely to fall over- 
board." 

" And get drowned?" 

" Sometimes. They can't always keep up till assist- 
itnce comes, especially if they can't swim. Solnetimes 
their fall is broken by the rigging, and they manage to 
save themselves by catching hold." 

They visited other parts of the ship, and' Randall con- 
tinued his explanations. The sailors were all on board, 
at work in various ways. They did not appear to notice 
the mate and his young companion when they passed, 
but Charlie, chancing to look behind him, observed one 
making a significant gesture to another, which evidently 
referred to them. 

Our young'hero mentally thought this not very polite, 
but did not pay much attention to it. 

About this time a porter arrived from the clothing- 
store already referred to, bringing a small blue chest. 

"This is the ship Bouncing Betsey, isn't it?" he 
inquired. 

" Yes," answered one of the sailors. 

" I was told to bring this chest here, then." 



"Who is it for?" 

" Jack Randall." 

" That's the mate, yon Inbber. Why don't you put- a 
handle to his name ? " 

'' No, it's for a boy." 

" We haven't got any such boy aboard as I knows on." 

" There ain't two ships of this name, are there?" 

" Not' as I ever heerd tell." 

" Then this must be the ship. Where shall I stow 
this chest ? I've got tired of bringing it on my back." 

" You'd better go and speak to the mate about it. 
There he stands. Mayhap that's the boy the kit belongs 
to." 

The porter walked forward. 

" Does thid belong to you?" he asked, laying down 
the chest. 

" Yes." 

" Then it-wasn't for a boy?" 

"Yes," answered the mate,% carelessly. "It is for a 
nephew of mine who is going with us this voyage." 

"Is that the young gentleman?" asked the porter, 
pointin   Charlie. 

" He Riks you're my nephew," said Randall, smil- 
ing. " A good joke, isn't it? " 

" This- young gentleman is only looking about the ship 
a little," he answered. " He don't think he should fancy 
going to sea." 

"Beg pardon, I didn't know but he might be the 
one." 

" Oh, no, certainly not." 

" Shall I leave the chest here?" 

" Yes, anywhere. No, you may carry it below. 





 

Here," summoning one of the sailors, "show this man 
where to put this chest." 

" So your nephew is going to sea," said Charlie, with 
some curiosity. 

"Yes." 

" Does he think he shall like to go ? " 

" I don't believe he thinks much about it." 

" How large a boy is he ? " 

" I should think he was about as large as you." Yes, 
come to think of it, I don't believe there can be any 
difiecence between you." 

The joke was a cruel one, as Charlie found to his 
cost, before long. 

" Is he on board now? " 

" I don't see him," said the mate, looking in the oppo- 
site direction from where Charlie was standing. " But 
I think he will be on board very soon. Were you ever 
dressed in sailor's clothes ? "  

" Never," said our here. 

" I wonder how you would look. You are just about 
my nephew's size. Have you any objection to trying on 
his clothes ? " 

Charlie had not. In fact he was rather curious to' 
learn how he should look in this unusual attire. Ac- 
cordingly he went below, and was soon dressed in full 
sailor rig. It was a very good fit, and very becoming 
to our hero, who was remarkably handsome boy.

" A good fit, i94t not? " asked the mate. 

" Excellent," sail Charlie. 

" One would almost think the clothes were meant for 
you," said Randall,' with a smile, which Charlie did not 
understand. 

 


Chablie sniveyed himself in his new attire with some 
complacency. He felt that it was becoming, and it gave 
him a new feeling of manliness. In fact it seemed to 
him, for the time being, as if he were really a sailor. 
Charlie, however, though he was very well pleased with 
his sailor's rig, did not feel in the least tempted to wear 
it professionally. Accordingly, after the survey was 
over, he began to divest himself of it. 

" What are you doing? " asked the mate, laying his 
hand heavily upon the shoulder of our young hero. 

" Taking off your nephew's clothes," returned Charlie, 
looking up in considerable surprise at the tone in which 
' he was addressed. 

"Whafs that for?" 

" To put on my own.'' 

" Then you needn't trouble yourself,'' said Randall, 
composedly ; '' those you have on are your own." 

"What do you mean?" asked  Charlie, meeting the 
mate's triumphant look with an op , manly glance. 

" I mean," said Randall, with a sardpnic look, " that 
the clothes were bought 'At the one who now wears 
theni," 

 




" Bought for me I " exclaimed Charlie, in great bewilderment. 

" Yes. You wondered how they happened to fit you 
so well. That is easily explained. They were picked 
out on purpose for you. The old Jew iii the clothing- 
store took your measure with his eye while you were 
standing th re with me. Faith, he's got a pretty sharp 
eye." 

" But your nephew? " said Charlie, his heart sinking, 
as he began to comprehend the plot to which he had 
fallen a victim ; " I thought you said they belonged to 
him." 

" Well," said Bandall, with a harsh laugh,- ' you're 
my nephew." 

'' I am not," said Charlie, with something of haughtiness in his tone, as he surveyed the mate scornfully. 

"He's got his mother's look," muttered the latter. 
" That's the way she looked when she sent me about my 
business. She'd ' look something different, I fancy, if 
she knew I'd got her boy in my power. Tve got the whip- 
hand of her now, and she'll live yet to repent the day 
she rejected Jack Bandall." 

These thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant, 
and did not prevent his answering at once Charlie's bold 
denial. 

" There's a little too much pride about you, youngster. 
It'll need taming down. You're to be my nephew while 
you're aboard this ship. Remember, your name is Jack 
Randall. Take care that you claim no other." 

" What good will that do ? " said Charlie. " I'm not 
going to remain on board." 

" You're not, eh?" said the mate, significantly. 

 



 

" No," said Charlie, boldly. 

" Suppose I say you shall." 

" Then," said Chaiiie, firmly, " I say you are mistaken." 

Our hero was a boy of spirit, and had no idea of being 
disposed of without his' own consent. He commenced 
tugging away at his blue jacket with the intention of 
pulling it off. 

" What are you doing? " asked Randall, with a frown  
advancing and laying a heavy hand on the boy's shoulder. " Haven't I told you to keep those clothes on? " 

'' You have no right to interfere with me," said Charlie, stoutly, his eye flasiiing with indignation. "Give 
me back my clothes." 

" You can't have them. If you strip off those you 
have on you'll have to go without any." 

Exasperated, Charlie made a spring forward, and attempted to wrest his clothes from the hands of the mate. 

" Ha, my fine fellow ! " exclaimed Randall, as, evading 
the boy's grasp, he lifted them beyond his reach. " So 
you are inclined to be mutinous, are you? Very well, 
we have a remedy for all such cases, and a very simple 
one it is." 

So saying, he drew a stout cord from his pocket, and 
advanced towards our hero with the intention of binding 
him. 

Charlie sprang for the stairs, and was half way up 
before the mate caught him and dragged him back. 

"Well, boy, you're a pretty tough customer — true 
grit. You're just the boy to make a sailor of. I must 
make sure of you." 

So saying, he succeeded, in spite of Charlie's vigorous 

 

exertions', in tying his hands and feet. Not until thus 
rendered quite helpless did the brave boy suffer himself 
to burst into tears. 

"What are you going to do with me?" he asked. 

" I am going to make a sailor of you," answered the 
mate. 

" But I don't want to go to sea," answered Charlie. 

" So you said once before, but you'll change your 
.mind before long." 

" My mother will not know where I am. She can't 
get along without me, for she depends upon me in part 
for support." 

" I dare say she'll get along somehow," said Randall, 
coolly. " She won't miss you much, and she ought to 
feel glad that your uncle has taken charge of you." 

" Uncle ! " retorted the boy, with flashing  eyes. " I 
wouldn't own you as uncle for all the money in Boston." 

" You wouldn't ! " said Randall, his tone changing, 
and a dark look overspreading his face. " Very well, 
my bold lad, you may have reason to repent those words. 
You may find out by and by that it is as well to be civil 
to your superior officer. I will do nothing about it now, 
but when we are out of port and fairly at sea, look out I " 

" Charlie, who was quick-witted, caught a hint from 
these words, and at once set up a scream, hoping to 
draw attention jfrom outside.' 

" That's your game, is it?" saidt he mate. "We'll 
soon stop that." 

So saying, he drew out the boy's own handkerchief, 
and gagged him so that there was no further fear of his 
being able to make any disturbance which could be heard 
on the wharf or on neighboring vessels. 



 



 

Feeling now secure, he left Charlie mute and helpless, 
and ascended to the deck. 

" What was the noise I heard below, Mr, Randall?" 
asked the captain, pausing in his walk, and addressing 
his first ofl3cer. 

" My nephew ! " said Randall, with a smile. 

'' Ha I he is a little obstreperous, is he ? " 

" A trifle so." 

" Doesn't like the society of his uncle sufficiently to 
want to go to sea with him, I suppose?" 

"I dare say he would like to change his quarters  
said Randall, composedly. 

" How did you reconcile him to his fate?" 

" A couple of strong cords and a gag did the business. 
They will keep him quiet till we get out to sea, and then 
perhaps we can discover some other means of bringing 
him to terms." 

" A slightly different application of the cords, per- 
haps, Mr. Randall." 

The mate smiled approval of this jest, and as his ser- 
vices were now in requisition to expedite preparations for 
departure, he left the captain and went about his duty. 

Meanwhile the mate's conduct had not been unobserved 
by the crew. Among these was an old sailor who rejoiced in the name of Bill Sturdy. It is needless to say 
that this was not his real name. No one appeared to 
know what his real name was, and he had become so used 
to this, that he generally called himself so. The name 
Sturdy had probably been given him on account of his 
sturdy make. He was stout and very powerful. Probaly there were no two men on board the ship who would 

ot have felt some hesitation in attacking Bill Sturdy. 

 





It may be added that the name was no less appropriate if we consider it bestowed on account of his character and disposition. He was unpolished enough, having 
beaten about the world all his life, yet he had been gifted 
by nature with a fund of sturdy common sense and powers of observation which made him more thoughtful and 
intelligent than most of his class. He had a kind heart, 
and hated to see oppression. This was his first voyage 
on board the Bouncing Betsy ; the ship on which he had 
last served having been wrecked, and he with a few others having, with diflSculty, saved themselves. Since he 
had engaged onboard the Betsy, the stories he had heard 
of the captain's brutality led him to repent of his determination, and he .had resolved within himself to remain on 
boai'd but a single voyage. 

He had had his attention drawn to our hero and the 
mate,4ind he observed that the latter came up alone from 
below. 

" That's a trim, handsome little lad," he said to himself ; "I wonder what the mate is so attentive to him 
for. There's some deviltry in the wind, as sure as my 
name is Bill Sturdy. I hope, for the boy's sake, he isn't 
going to ship with us. If he does, I must do what I can 
for him, for I mistrust he'll want a friend." 



 


The thoughts of our young hero as he lay helpless, 
gagged and bound, were hardly of the most cheerful 
character. The blow had been so sudden, that he was 
quite unprepared for it. Added to this, his apprehensions were vague and indefinite. Thiere seemed something mysterious about the manner in which he had been 
spirited away, and this thought increased his feeling of 
discomfort. A danger which can be measured and comprehended in its full extent may be boldly faced, however great, but when we are ignorant of its nature and 
extent that is not so easy. 

Charlie understood as much as this, that it was the intention of Eandall to carry him off to sea. But why he 
should have taken such pains to ensnare him, when there 
are always plenty of boys glad to obtain such a situation, he could not conceive. 

Charlie was no coward. He was no stranger to the 
bold spirit of adventure by which boys of his age are 
apt to be animated. Indeed, under different circumstances, and if the arrangement had been of his own free 
choice, it is quite possible that he might have looked 
forward with pleasurable anticipations to the life that 
awaited him. But there was one thought uppermost in 



 


his mind that gave him no little pain and anxiety, the 
thought of his mother. He was her all. In the large 
and busy city she knew but very few ; she had none 
whom she could call friends. Her hopes were all centred in him. Still farther, it was in a great measure 
owing to his activity and industry that she had been 
able to live with a degree of comfort, for though she 
was always at work, the avenues of industry open to women are few, and toil at the needle is so unsatisfactorily 
compensated that Charlie, though working fewer hours, 
was able to contribute considerably more than half of 
the sum required for their joint support. 

How would his mother get along during his absence, 
the length of which ha could not estimate? Would she 
suffer not only in mind but in bodily discomfort ? Well 
he remembered how pleasantly the evenings had passed 
when they were together. Now there must be a long 
separation. Would he ever see his mother again? She 
would not be able to retain their present lodging, now 
that the entire rent would fall to her to pay. Perhaps 
when he did he should be unable to obtain any clew to 
her whereabouts. This was indeed a terrible thought to 
poor Charlie, who chafed like a caged lion in his confinement. He endeavored to unloose the cords which 
bound him, but with little prospect of success;- for no 
one better than a sailor understands the ai-t of tying a 
knot securely. 

While Charlie was doing his utmost to free himself 
from the cords that bound him, having already removed 
the gag, he was startled by a low laugh of triumphant 
malice. « 

Looking np, he saw the mate, the author of all his 



 



 

misfortunes, watching him with great apparent enjoy- 
ment. , 

" Ah, Jack," he said, " I see you are hard at work. 
Work away. If you untie those knots you've got more 
skilful fingers than the one that tied them, that's all." 

'' Come and release me," said Charlie. " You have 
no right to keep me here." 

" You are mistaken," said the mate, coolly. " I have 
the best of all rights." 

" And what right is that? " demanded our hero.   

" 27'power! " answered Eandall. " Might 
makes right, perhaps you have heard." 

" How long are you going to keep me here?" asked 
Charlie, after a pause. 

'  Till we get far enough out to sea to' make it safe to 
release you." 

Charlie kept silence. He felt that it would be useless 
to appeal to the mercy of the mate, who appeared bent
