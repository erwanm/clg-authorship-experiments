don't ? " 

" You'll get yourself killed ! You'll start a fight, and 
get a lot of these poor devils shot! Use your common 
sense, Hal ; the company has brought in guards, and they 
are armed, and your people aren't." 

" That's exactly why I have to speak ! " 

The discussion was carried on under difficulties, the 
elder brother clinging to the younger's arm, while the 



 

younger sought to pull free, and the mob shouted with a 
single voice, " Speech ! Speech ! " There were some 
near by who, like Klowoski, did not relish having this 
stranger interfering with their champion, and showed 
signs of a disposition to " mix in " ; so at last Edward gave 
up the struggle, and the orator mounted the steps and faced 
the throng. 



 Hal raised his arms as a signal for silence. 

" Boys," he cried, " they've kidnapped our committee. 
They think they'll break our strike that way — but they'll 
find they've made a mistake ! " 

" They will ! Right you are ! " roared a score of voices. 

" They forget that we've got a union. Hurrah for our 
North Valley union ! " 

" Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " The cry echoed to the canyon- 
walls. 

" And hurrah for the big union that will back us — the 
United Mine- Workers of America ! " 

Again the yell rang out ; again and again. " Hurrah 
for the union ! Hurrah for the United Mine- Workers ! " 
A big American miner, Ferris, was in the front of the 
throng, and his voice beat in Hal's ears like a steam-siren. 

" Boys," Hal resumed, when at last he could be heard, 
" use your brains a moment. I warned you they would 
try to provoke you ! They would like nothing better than 
to start a scrap here, and get a chance to smash our union ! 
Don't forget that, boys, if they can make you fight, they'll 
sinash the union, and the union is our only hope ! " 

Again came the cry : " Hurrah for the union ! " Hal 
let them shout it in twenty languages, until they were sat- 
isfied. 

" Now, boys," he went on, at last, " they've shipped out 
our committee. They may ship me out in the same 
way — " 



 

" No, they won't ! " shouted voices in the crowd. And 
there was a bellow of rage from Ferris. " Let them try 
it ! We'll burn them in their beds ! " 

" But they can ship me out ! " argued Hal. " You 
know they can beat us at that game ! They can call on the 
sheriff, they can get the soldiers, if necessary ! We can't 
oppose them by force — they can turn out every man, 
woman and child in the village, if they choosy What 
we have to get clear is that even that won't crush our union ! 
Nor the big union outside, that will be backing us ! We 
can hold out, and make them take us back in the end ! " 

Some of Hal's friends, seeing what he was trying to do, 
came to his support. " No fighting ! No violence ! 
Stand by the union ! " And he went on to drive the lesson 
home ; even though the company might evict them, the big 
union of the four hundred and fifty thousand mine-work- 
ers of the country would feed them, it would call out the 
rest of the workers in the district in sympathy. So the 
bosses, who thought to starve and cow them into submis- 
sion, would find their mines lying permanently idle. They 
would be forced to give way, and the tactics of solidarity 
would triumph. 

So Hal went on, recalling the things Olson had told him, 
and putting them into practice. He saw hope in their 
faces again, dispelling the mood of resentment and rage. 

" Now, boys," said he, " I'm going in to see the super- 
intendent for you. I'll be your committee, since they've 
shipped out the rest." 

The steam-siren of Ferris bellowed again: "You're 
the boy ! Joe Smith ! " 

" All right, men — now mind what I say ! I'll see the 
super, and then I'll go down to Pedro, where there'll be 
some officers of the United Mine-workers this morning. 
I'll tell them the situation, and ask them to back you. 
That's what you want, is it ? " 

That was what they wanted. " Big union ! " 



( 



 

" All right. I'll do the best I can for you, and I'll find 
some way to get word to you. And meantime you stand 
firm. The bosses will tell you lies, they'll try to deceive 
you, they'll send spies and trouble-makers among you — 
but you hold fast, and wait for the big union." 

Hal stood looking at the cheering crowd. He had time 
to note some of the faces upturned to him. Pitiful, toil- 
worn faces they were, each making its separate appeal, 
telling its individual story of deprivation and defeat 
Once more they were transfigured, shining with that 
wonderful new light which he had seen for the first time 
the previous evening. It had been crushed for a moment, 
but it flamed up again; it would never die in the hearts 
of men — once they had learned the power it gave. Noth- 
ing Hal had yet seen moved him so much as this new birth 
of enthusiasm. A beautiful, a terrible thing it was ! 

Hal looked at his brother, to see how he had been moved. 
What he saw on his brother's face was satisfaction, bound- 
less relief. The matter had turned out all right! Hal 
was coming away!

Hal turned again to the men ; somehow, after his glance 
at Edward, they seemed more pitiful than ever. For Ed- 
ward typified the power they were facing — the unseeing, 
uncomprehending power that meant to crush them. The 
possibility of failure was revealed to Hal in a flash of emo- 
tion, overwhelming him. He saw them as they would be, 
when no leader was at hand to make speeches to them. 
He saw them waiting, their life-long habit of obedience 
striving to reassert itself ; a thousand fears besetting them, 
a thousand rumours preying upon them — wild beasts set 
on them by their cunning enemies. They would suffer, 
not merely for themselves, but for their wives and chil- 
dren — the very same pangs of dread that Hal suffered 
when he thought of one old man up in Western City, whose 
doctors had warned him to avoid excitement. 

If they stood firm, if they kept their bargain with 



 

their leader, they would be evicted from their homes, they 
would face the cold of the coming winter, they would face 
hunger and the black-list. And he, meantime — what 
would he be doing? What was his part of the bargain? 
He would interview the superintendent for them, he would 
turn them over to the " big union " — and then he would 
go off to his own life of ease and pleasure. To eat grilled 
steaks and hot rolls in a perfectly appointed club, with 
suave and softly-moving servitors at his beck! To dance 
at the country club with exquisite creatures of chiffon and 
satin, of perfume and sweet smiles and careless, happy 
charms! No, it was too easy! He might call that his 
duty to his father and brother, but he would know in his 
heart that it was treason to life ; it was the devil, taking 
him onto a high mountain and showing him all the king- 
doms of the earth ! 

Moved by a sudden impulse, Hal raised his hands once 
more. " Boys," he said, " we understand each other now. 
You'll not go back to work till the big union tells you. 
And I, for my part, will stand by you. Your cause is my 
cause, I'll go on fighting for you till you have your rights, 
till you can live and work as men ! Is that right ? " 

"' That's right ! That's right ! " 

" Very good, then — we'll swear to it ! " And Hal 
raised his hands, and the men raised theirs, and amid a 
storm of shouts, and a frantic waving of caps, he made 
them the pledge which he knew would bind his own con- 
science. He made it deliberately, there in his brother's 
presence. This was no mere charge on a trench, it was en- 
listing for a war ! But even in that moment of fervour, 
Hal would have been frightened had he realised the pe- 
riod of that enlistment, the years of weary and desperate 
conflict to which he was pledging his life. 



Hal descended from his rostrum, and the crowds 



 

made way for him, and with his brother at his side he went 
down the street to the office building, upon the porch of 
which the guards were standing. His progress was a tri- 
umphal one ; rough voices shouted words of encouragement 
in his ears, men jostled and fought to shake his hand or to 
pat him on the back ; they even patted Edward and tried to 
shake his hand, because he was with Hal, and seemed to 
have his confidence. Afterwards Hal thought it over and 
was merry. Such an adventure for Edward ! 

The younger man went up the steps of the building and 
spoke to the guards. " I want to see Mr. Cartwright." 

" He's inside," answered one, not cordially. With Ed- 
ward following, Hal entered, and was ushered into the pri- 
vate office of the superintendent. 

Having been a working-man, and class-conscious, Hal 
was observant of the manners of mine-superintendents; 
he noted that Cartwright bowed politely to Edward, but 
did not include Edward's brother. "Mr. Cartwright," 
he said, " I have come to you as a deputation from the 
workers of this camp." 

The superintendent did not appear impressed by the 
announcement. 

" I am instructed to say that the men demand the re- 
dress of four grievances before they return to work. 
First — " 

Here Cartwright spoke, in his quick, sharp way. 
" There's no use going on, sir. This company will deal 
only with its men as individuals. It will recognise no 
deputations." 

Hal's answer was equally quick. "Very well, Mr. 
Cartwright. In that case, I come to you as an individual." 

For a moment the superintendent seemed nonplussed. 

" I wish to ask four rights which are granted to me by 
the laws of this state. First, the right to belong to a 
union, without being discharged for it." 

The other had recovered his manner of quiet mastery. 



 

"You have that right, sir ; you have always had it. You 
know perfectly well that the company has never discharged 
any one for belonging to a union," 

The man was looking at Hal, and there was a duel of 
the eyes between them. A cold anger moved Hal. His 
ability to endure this sort of thing was at an end. " Mr. 
Cartwright," he said, " you are the servant of one of the 
world's greatest actors; and you support him ably." 

The other flushed and drew back; Edward put in 
quickly: "Hal, there's nothing to be gained by such 
talk ! " 

" He has all the world for an audience," persisted Hal. 
" He plays the most stupendous farce — and he and all 
his actors wearing such solemn faces ! " 

" Mr. Cartwright," said Edward, with dignity, " I trust 
you understand that I have done everything I can to re- 
strain my brother." 

" Of course, Mr. Warner," replied the superintendent. 
"And you must know that I, for my part, have done 
everything to show your brother consideration." 

" Again ! " exclaimed Hal. " This actor is a gen- 
ius!" 

" Hal, if you have business with Mr. Cartwright — " 

" He showed me consideration by sending his gunmen 
to seize me at night, drag me out of a cabin, and nearly 
twist the arm off me ! Such humour never was ! " 

Cartwright attempted to speak — but looking at Ed- 
ward, not at Hal. " At that time — " 

" He showed me consideration by having me locked up 
in jail and fed on bread and water for two nights and a 
day ! Can you beat that humour ? " 

" At that time I did not know — " 

" By forging my name to a letter and having it circu- 
lated in the camp ! Finally — most considerate of all — 
by telling a newspaper man that I had seduced a girl 
here ! " 



 

The superintendent flushed still redder. " No ! " he de- 

ClflTGQ 

" What? " cried Hal. " You didn't tell Billy Keating 
of the Gazette that I had seduced a girl in North Valley ? 
You didn't describe the girl to him — a red-haired Irish 
girl ? " 

u I merely said, Mr. Warner, that I had heard certain 



rumours — " 



Certain rumours, Mr. Cartwright? The certainty 
was all of your making ! " You made a definite and explicit 
statement to Mr. Keating — " 

" I did not ! " declared the other. 

" I'll soon prove it ! " And Hal started towards the 
telephone on Cartwright's desk. 

" What are you going to do, Hal ? " 

" I am going to get Billy Keating on the wire, and let 
you hear his statement." 

" Oh, rot, Hal ! " cried Edward. " I don't care any- 
thing about Keating's statement. You know that at that 
time Mr. Cartwright had no means of knowing who you 



were." 



Cartwright was quick to grasp this support. " Of 
course not, Mr. Warner! Your brother came here, pre- 
tending to be a working boy — " 

"Oh!" cried Hal. "So that's it! You think it 
proper to circulate slanders about working boys in your 
camp ? " 

" You have been here long enough to know what the 
morals of such boys are." 

" I have been here long enough, Mr. Cartwright, to 
know that if you want to go into the question of morals in 
North Valley, the place for you to begin is with the bosses 
and guards you put in authority, and allow to prey upon 



women." 



Edward broke in : " Hal, there's nothing to be gained 




by pursuing this conversation. If you have any business 
here, get it over with, for God's sake ! " 

Hal made an effort to recover his self-possession. He 
came back to the demands of the strike — but only to find 
that he had used up the superintendent's self-possession. 
" I have given you my answer," declared Cartwright, " I 
absolutely decline any further discussion." 

" Well," said Hal, " since you decline to permit a depu- 
tation of your men to deal with you in plain, business-like 
fashion, I have to inform you as an individual that every 
other individual in your camp refuses to work for you." 

The superintendent did not let himself be impressed by 
this elaborate sarcasm. " All I have to tell you, sir, is 
that Number Two mine will resume work in the morning, 
and that any one who refuses to work will be sent down 
the canyon before night." 

" So quickly, Mr. Cartwright ? They have rented their 
homes from the company, and you know that according to 
the company's own lease they are entitled to three days' 
notice before being evicted ! " 

Cartwright was so unwise as to argue. He knew that 
Edward was hearing, and he wished to clear himself. 
" They will not be evicted by the company. They will 
be dealt with by the town authorities." 

" Of which you yourself are the head ? " 

" I happen to have been elected mayor of North Val- 
ley." 

" As mayor of North Valley, you gave my brother to un- 
derstand that you would put me out, did you not ? " 

" I asked your brother to persuade you to leave." 

" But you made clear that if he could not do this, you 
would put me out ? " 

" Yes, that is true." 

"And the reason you gave was that you had had 
instructions by telegraph from Mr. Peter Harrigan. May 




I ask to what office Mr. Harrigan has been elected in your 
town?" 

Cartwright saw his difficulty. "Your brother misun- 
derstood me," he said, crossly. 

" Did you misunderstand him, Edward ? " 

Edward had walked to the window in disgust ; he was 
looking at tomato-cans and cinder-heaps, and did not see 
fit to turn around. But the superintendent knew that he 
was hearing, and considered it necessary to cover the flaw 
in his argument. " Young man," said he, " you have vio- 
lated several of the ordinances of this town." 

" Is there an ordinance against organising a union of 
the miners ? " 

" No ; but there is one against speaking on the streets." 

" Who passed that ordinance, if I may ask ? " 

" The town council." 

" Consisting of Johnson, postmaster and company-store 
clerk; Ellison, company book-keeper; Strauss, company 
pit-boss ; O' Callahan, company saloon-keeper. Have I the 
list correct ? " 

Cartwright did not answer. 

" And the fifth member of the town council is yourself, 
ex-officio — Mr. Enos Cartwright, mayor and company- 
superintendent." 

Again there was no answer. 

" You have an ordinance against street-speaking ; and 
at the same time your company owns the saloon-buildings, 
the boarding-houses, the church and the school. Where 
do you expect the citizens to do their speaking ? " 

" You would make a good lawyer, young man. But we 
who have charge here know perfectly well what you mean 
by * speaking ' ! " 

" You don't approve, then, of the citizens holding meet- 
ings?" 

" I mean that we don't consider it necessary to provide 
agitators with opportunity to incite our employes." 




 

" May I ask, Mr. Cartwright, are you speaking as mayor 
of an American community, or as superintendent of a coal- 
mine ? " 

Cartwright's face had been growing continually redder. 
Addressing Edward's back, he said, " I ctan't see any rea- 
son why this should continue." 

And Edward was of the same opinion. He turned. 
" Keally, Hal — " 

" But, Edward ! A man accuses your brother of being 
a law-breaker ! Have you hitherto known of any criminal 
tendencies in our family ? " 

Edward turned to the window again and resumed his 
study of the cinder-heaps and tomato-cans. It was a vul- 
gar and stupid quarrel, but he had seen enough of Hal's 
mood to realise that he would go on and on, so long as any 
one was indiscreet enough to answer him. 

" You say, Mr. Cartwright, that I have violated the or- 
dinance against speaking on the street. May I ask what 
penalty this ordinance carries ? " 

"You will find out when the penalty is exacted of you." 

Hal laughed. " From what you said just now, I gather 
that the penalty is expulsion from the town ! If I under- 
stand legal procedure, I should have been brought before 
the justice of the peace — who happens to be another com- 
pany store-clerk. Instead of that, I am sentenced by the 
mayor — or is it the company superintendent? May I 
ask how that comes to be ? " 

" It is because of my consideration — " 

" When did I ask consideration ? " 

" Consideration for your brother, I mean." 

" Oh ! Then your ordinance provides that the mayor 
— or is it the superintendent ? — may show consideration 
for the brother of a law-breaker, by changing his penalty 
to expulsion from the town. Was it consideration for 
Tommie Burke that caused you to have his sister sent down 
the canyon ? " 



 

Cartwright clenched his hands. "I've had all I'll 
stand of this ! " 

He was again addressing Edward's back; and Edward 
turned and answered, " I don't blame you, sir." Then, 
to Hal, " I really think you've said enough ! " 

I hope I've said enough," replied Hal — " to convince 
you that the pretence of American law in this coal-camp 
is a silly farce, an insult and a humiliation to any man who 
respects the institutions of his country." 

'' You, Mr. Warner," said the superintendent, to Ed- 
ward, "have had experience in managing coal-mines. 
You know what it means to deal with ignorant foreigners, 
who have no understanding of American law — " 

Hal burst out laughing. " So you're teaching them 
American law! You're teaching them by setting at 
naught every law of your town and state, every constitu- 
tional guarantee — and substituting the instructions you 
get by telegraph from Peter Harrigan ! " 

Cartwright turned and walked to the door. "Young 
man," said he, over his shoulder, "it will be necessary 
for you to leave North Valley this morning. I only hope 
your brother will be able to persuade you to leave without 
trouble." And the bang of the door behind him was the 
superintendent's only farewell. 



 Edward turned upon his brother. " Now what 
the devil did you want to put me through a scene like that 
for ? So undignified ! So utterly uncalled for ! A 
quarrel with a man so far beneath you ! " 

Hal stood where the superintendent had left him. He 
was looking at his brother's angry face. " Was that all 
you got out of it, Edward ? " 

"All that stuff about your private character! What 
do you care what a fellow like Cartwright thinks about 
you ? " 



 

" I care nothing at all what he thinks, but I care about 
having him use such a slander. That's one of their regu- 
lar procedures, so Billy Keating says." 

Edward answered, coldly, " Take my advice, and realise 
that when you deny a scandal, you only give it circula- 
tion." 

" Of course," answered Hal. " That's what makes me 
so angry. Think of the girl, the harm done to her ! " 

" It's not up to you to worry about the girl." 

" Suppose that Cartwright had slandered some woman 
friend of yours. Would you have felt the same indiffer- 
ence ? " 

" He'd not have slandered any friend of mine ; I choose 
my friends more carefully." 

" Yes, of course. What that means is that you choose 
them among the rich. But I happen to be more demo- 
cratic in my tastes — " 

" Oh, for heaven's sake ! " cried Edward. " You re- 
formers are all alike — you talk and talk and talk ! " 

" I can tell you the reason for that, Edward — a man 
like you can shut his eyes, but he can't shut his ears ! " 

" Well, can't you let up on me for awhile — long enough 
to get out of this place ? I feel as if I were sitting on the 
top of a volcano, and I've no idea when it may break out 
again." 

Hal b^gan to laugh. " All right," he said ; " I guess 
I haven't shown much appreciation of your visit. I'll be 
more sociable now. My next business is in Pedro, so 
I'll go that far with you. There's one thing more — " 

" What is it ? " 

" The company owes me money — " 

" What money ? " 

" Some I've'earned." 

It was Edward's turn to laugh. " Enough to buy you 
a shave and a bath ? " 

He took out his wallet, and pulled off several bills ; and 



 

Hal, watching him, realised suddenly a change which had 
taken place in his own psychology. Not merely had he 
acquired the class-consciousness of the working-man, he 
had acquired the money-consciousness as well. He was 
actually concerned about the dollars the company owed 
himl He had earned those dollars by back- and heart- 
breaking toil, lifting lumps of coal into cars ; the sum was 
enough to keep the whole Rafferty family alive for a week 
or two. And here was Edward, with a smooth brown 
leather wallet full of ten- and twenty-dollar bills, which 
he peeled off without counting, exactly as if money grew 
on trees, or as if coal came out of the earth and walked 
into furnaces to the sound of a fiddle and a flute ! 

Edward had of course no idea of these abnormal proc- 
esses going on in his brother's mind. He was holding out 
the bills. " Get yourself some decent things," he said. 
" I hope you don't have to stay dirty in order to feel 
democratic ? " 

" No," answered Hal ; and then, " How are we going ? " 

" I've a car waiting, back of the office." 

" So you had everything ready ! " But Edward made 
no answer ; afraid of setting off the volcano again. 



 They went out by the rear door of the office, en- 
tered the car, and sped out of the village, unseen by the 
crowd. And all the way down the canyon Edward pleaded 
with Hal to drop the controversy and come home at once. 
He brought up the tragic question of Dad again; when 
that did not avail, he began to threaten. Suppose Hal's 
money-resources were to be cut off, suppose he were to 
find himself left out of his father's will — what would he 
do then ? Hal answered, without a smile, " I can alwajs 
get a job as organiser for the United Mine-Workers." 

So Edward gave up that line of attack. " If you won't 




 

come," he declared, " I'm going to stay by you till you 
do!" 

" All right," said HaL He could not help smiling at 
this dire threat. " But if I take you about and introduce 
you to my friends, you must agree that what you hear shall
