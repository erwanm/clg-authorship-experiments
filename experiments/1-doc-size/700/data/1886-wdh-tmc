unconsciously aware that no extravagance of hers 
can be dangerous while Lemuel is in the house." 

" Unconsciously aware is good. She hasn't got 
tired of reforming him yet ?" 

" I don't know. I sometimes think she wishes he 
had gone a little farther in crime. Then his refor 
mation would be more obvious." 

" Yes ; I can appreciate that. Does she still look 
after his art and literature ?" 

" That phase has changed a little. She thinks 
now that he ought to be stimulated, if anything 
that he ought to read George Eliot. She 's put 
Middlcmarcli and Romola on his -shelf. She says 
that he looks like Tito Malemma." 

Sewell rose. " AVell, I don't see but what your 
supplement is a very demoralising element. I shall 
never dare to tell Mrs. Sewell what you've  said." 

"Oh, she knows it," cried Miss Vane. "We've  



 

agreed that you will counteract any temptation that 
Lemuel may feel to abuse his advantages by the fero 
ciously self-denying sermons you preach at him 
every Sunday." 

" Do I preach at him ? Do you notice it ?" asked 
Sewell nervously. 

"Notice it?" laughed Miss Vane. "I should 
think your whole congregation would notice it. You 
seem to look at nobody else." 

" I know it ! Since he began to come, I can't 
keep my eyes off him. I do deliver my sermons at 
him. I believe I write them at him ! He has an 
eye of terrible and exacting truth. I feel myself on 
trial before him. He holds me up to a standard of 
sincerity that is killing me. Mrs. Sewell was bad 
enough ; I was reasonably bad myself ; but this ! 
Couldn't you keep him away ? Do you think it ; 's 
exactly decorous to let your man-servant occupy a 
seat in your family pew ? How do you suppose it 
looks to the Supreme Being ?" 

Miss Vane was convulsed. " I had precisely those 
misgivings ! But Lemuel hadn t. He asked me what 
the number of our pew was, and I hadn't the heart 
or else I hadn't the face to tell him he mustn't 
sit in it. How could I ? Do you think it 's so very 
scandalous  ?" 

" I don't know," said Sewell. " It may lead to 
great abuses. If we tacitly confess ourselves equal 
in the sight of God, how much better are we than 
the Roman Catholics ? " 

Miss Vane could not suffer these ironies to go on. 



" He approves of your preaching. He has talked 
your sermons over with me. You oughtn't to 
complain." 

" Oh, I don't ! Do you think he 's really softening 
a little toward me ? " 

" Not personally, that I know," said Miss Vane. 
" But he seems to regard you as a channel of the 
truth." 

"I ought to be glad of so much," said Sewell. 
" I confess that I hadn't supposed he was at all 
of our way of thinking. They preached a very 
appreciable orthodoxy at Willoughby Pastures." 

" I don't know about that," said Miss Varie. " I 
only know that he approves your theology, or your 
ethics." 

" Ethics, I hope. I' m sure they're  right." After a 
thoughtful moment the minister asked, "Have you 
observed that they have softened him socially at 
all broken up that terrible rigidity of attitude, 
that dismaying retentiveness of speech ?" 

" I know what you mean ! cried Miss Vane de 
lightedly. " I believe Lemuel is a little more supple, 
a little less like a granite boulder in one of his 
meadows. But I can't say that he 's glib yet. He 
isn't apparently going to say more than he thinks." 

" I hope he thinks more than he says," sighed the 
minister. " My interviews with Lemuel have left 
me not only exhausted but bruised, as if I had been 
hurling myself against a dead wall. Yes, I' manage 
him better from the pulpit, and I certainly oughtn't 
to complain. I don't expect him to make any re- 



 

sponse, and I perceive that I am not quite so sore as 
after meeting him in private life." 

That evening Lemuel was helping to throng the 
platform of an overcrowded horse-car. It was Satur 
day night, and he was going to the provision man 
up toward the South End, whom Miss Vane was 
dealing with for the time being, in an economical 
recoil from her expensive Back Bay provision man, 
to order a forgotten essential of the Sunday 's sup 
plies. He had already been at the grocer s, and was 
carrying home three or four packages to save the 
cart from going a third time that day to Bolingbroke 
Street, and he stepped down into the road when 
two girls came squeezing their way out of the car. 

" Well, I' m glad," said one of them in a voice 
Lemuel knew at once, " t there 's one man 's got the 
politeness to make a little grain o room for you. 
Thank you, sir !" she added, with more scorn for 
the others than gratitude for Lemuel. " You're  a 
gentleman, anyway. " 

The hardened offenders on the platform laughed, 
but Lemuel said simply, "You're  quite welcome." 

"Why, land 's sakes ! " shouted the girl. " Well, 
if tain't you ! S tira ! " she exclaimed to her com 
panion in utter admiration. Then she added to 
Lemuel, "Why, I didn't 's pose but what you'd a 
be n back home long ago. Well, I am glad. Be n 
in Boston ever since ? Well, I want to know ! " 

The conductor had halted his car for the girls to 
get off, but, as he remarked with a vicious jerk at 


his bell-strap, he could not keep his car standing 
there while a woman was asking about the folks, and 
the horses started up and left Lemuel behind. 
" Well, there ! " said Manda Grier.  I hain't 
made you lose your car ! I never see folks like 
some them conductors." 

" Oh, I guess I can walk the rest of the way," 
said Lemuel, his face bright with a pleasure visible 
in the light of the lamp that brought out Statira 
Dudley 's smiles and the forward thrust of Manda 
Grier 's whopper-jaw as they turned toward the 
pavement together. 

" Well, I guess f I've spoke about you once, I 
have a hundred times, in the last six weeks. I 
always told S tira you'd be n sure to turn up b fore 
this f you'd be n in Boston all the time ; not I 
guessed you'd got a disgust for the place, n't you 
wouldn't want to see it again for one while." 

Statira did not say anything. She walked on the 
other side of Manda Grier, who thrust her in the 
side from time to time with a lift of her elbow, 
in demand of sympathy and corroboration ; but 
though she only spoke to answer yes or no, Lemuel 
could see that she was always smiling or else biting 
her lip to keep herself from it. He thought she 
looked about as pretty as anybody could, and that 
she was again very fashionably dressed. She had 
on a short dolman, and a pretty hat that shaded her 
forehead but fitted close round, and she wore long 
gloves that came up on her sleeves. She had a book 
from the library ; she walked with a little bridling 



 

movement that he found very ladylike. Manda 
Grier tilted along between them, and her tongue ran 
and ran, so that Lemuel, when they came to Miss 
Vane 's provision man s, could hardly get in a word 
to say that he guessed he must stop there. 

Statira drifted on a few paces, but Manda Grier 
halted abruptly with him. "Well, if you're  ever 
up our -way we sh'd be much pleased to have you 
call, Mr. Barker," she said formally. 

" I should be much pleased to do so," said Lemuel 
with equal state. 

" Tain't but just a little ways round here on the 
Avenue," she added. 

Lemuel answered, "I guess I know where it is." 
He did not mean it for anything of a joke, but 
both the girls laughed, and though she had been so 
silent before, Statira laughed the most. 

"He could not help laughing either when Manda 
Grier said, "I guess if you was likely to forget the 
number you could go round to the station and 
inquire. They got your address too." 

" Manda Grier, you be still ! " said Statira. 

" S tira said that 's the way she knew you was 
from Willoughby Pastures. Her folks is from up 
that way, themselves. She says the minute she 
heard the name she knew it couldn't V be n you, 
whoever it was done it," 

" Manda Grier ! " cried Statira again. 

"I tell her she don't believe t any harm can 
come out the town o Willoughby, anywheres." 

" Manda ! " cried Statira 



 

Lemuel was pleased, but he could not say a word. 
He could not look at Statira. 

" Well, good evening," said Amanda Grier. 

"Well, good evening," said Lemuel. 

" Well, good evening," said Statira. 

"Well, good evening," said Lemuel again. 

The next moment they were gone round the 
corner, and he was left standing before the pro 
vision man s, with his packages in his hand. It did 
not come to him till he had transacted his business 
within, and was on his way home, that he had been 
very impolite not to ask if he might not see them 
home. He did not know but he ought to go back 
and try to find them, and apologise for his rudeness, 
and yet he did not see how he could do that, 
either ; he had no excuse for it ; he was afraid it 
would seem queer, and make them laugh. Besides, 
he had those things for Miss Vane, and the cook 
wanted some of them at once. 

He could hardly get to sleep that night for 
thinking of his blunder, and at times he cowered 
under the bedclothes for shame. He decided that 
the only way for him to do was to keep out of their 
way after this, and if he ever met them anywhere, 
to pretend not to see them. 

The next morning he went to hear Mr. Sewell 
preach, as usual, but he found himself wandering far 
from the sermon, and asking or answering this or 
that in a talk with those girls that kept going on in 
his mind. The minister himself seemed to wander, 
and at times, when Lemuel forced a return to him, 



 

he thought he was boggling strangely. For the 
first time Mr. Sewell 's sermon, in his opinion, did 
not come to much. 

While his place in Miss Vane 's household was 
indefinitely ascertained, he had the whole of Sunday, 
and he always wrote home in the afternoon, or 
brought up the arrears of the journal he had begun 
keeping ; but the Sunday afternoon that followed, he 
was too excited to stay in and write. He thought 
he would go and take a walk, and get away from 
the things that pestered him. He did not watch 
where he was going, and after a while he turned a 
corner, and suddenly found himself in a long street, 
planted with shade-trees, and looking old-fashioned 
and fallen from a former dignity. He perceived that 
it could never have been fashionable, like Boling- 
broke Street or Beacon ; the houses were narrow, 
and their doors opened from little, cavernous arches 
let into the brick fronts, and they stood flush upon 
the pavement. The sidewalks were full of people, 
mostly girls walking up and down ; at the corners 
young fellows lounged, and there were groups before 
the cigar stores and the fruit stalls, which were open. 
It was not very cold yet, and the children who 
swarmed upon the low door-steps were bareheaded 
and often summer-clad. The street was not nearly 
so well kept as the streets on the Back Bay that 
Lemuel was more used to, but. he could see that it 
was not a rowdy street either. He looked up at a 
lamp on the first corner he came to, and read 
Pleasant Avenue on it; then he said that the witch 



 

was in it. He dramatised a scene of meeting those 
girls, and was very glib in it, and they were rather 
shy, and Miss Dudley kept behind Amanda Grier, 
who nudged her with her elbow when Lemuel said 
he had come round to see if anybody had robbed 
them of their books on the way home after he left 
them last night. 

But all the time, as he hurried along to the next 
corner, he looked fearfully to the right and left. 
Presently he began to steal guilty glances at the 
numbers of the houses. He said to himself that he 
would see what kind of a looking house they did 
live in, any way. It was only No. 900 odd when 
he began, and he could turn off if he wished long 
before he reached 1334. As he drew nearer he 
said he would just give a look at it, and then rush 
by. But 1334 was a house so much larger and 
nicer than he had expected that he stopped to 
collect his slow rustic thoughts, and decide whether 
she really lived there or whether she had just given 
that number for a blind. He did not know why 
he should think that, though ; she was dressed well 
enough to come out of any house. 

While he lingered before the house an old man 
with a cane in his hand and his mouth hanging 
open stopped and peered through his spectacles, 
whose glare he fixed upon Lemuel, till he began to 
feel himself a suspicious character. The old man 
did not say anything, but stood faltering upon his 
stick and now and then gathering up his lower lip 
as if he were going to speak, but not speaking. 



 

Lemuel cleared his throat. " Hmmn ! Is this a 
boarding-house ? " 

" I don't know," crowed the old man, in a high 
senile note. " You want table-board or rooms ? " 

" I don't want board at all," began Lemuel again. 

" What ? " crowed the old man ; and he put up 
his hand to his ear. 

People were beginning to put their heads out of the 
neighbouring windows, and to walk slowly as they 
went by, so as to hear what he and the old man were 
saying. He could not run away now, and he went 
boldly up to the door of the large house and rang. 

A girl came, and he asked her, with a flushed face, 
if Miss Amanda Grier boarded there ; somehow he 
could not bear to ask for Miss Dudley. 

" Well," the girl said, " she rooms here," as if that 
might be a different thing to Lemuel altogether. 

"Oh!" he said. "Is she in ? " 

"Well, you can walk in," said the girl, "and I'll see." 
She came back to ask, " Who shall I say called ? " 

" Mr. Barker," said Lemuel, and then glowed 
with shame because he had called himself Mister. 
The girl did not come back, but she hardly seemed 
gone before Manda Grier came into the room. He 
did not know whether she would speak to him, but 
she was as pleasant as could be, and said he must 
come right up to her and S tira 's room. It was 
pretty high up, but he did not notice the stairs, 
Manda Grier kept talking so ; and when he got to it, 
and Manda Grier dashed the door open, and told him 
to walk right in, he would not have known but he 


 

was in somebody 's sitting-room. A curtained 
alcove hid the bed, and the room was heated by a 
cheerful little kerosene stove; there were bright 
folding carpet-chairs, and the lid of the washstand 
had a cloth on it that came down to the floor, and 
there were plants in the window. There was a 
mirror on the wall, framed in black walnut with 
gilt moulding inside, and a family-group photograph 
in the same kind of frame, and two chromes, and a 
clock on a bracket. 

Statira seemed surprised to see him; the room 
was pretty warm, and her face was flushed. He 
said it was quite mild out, and she said, " Was it ? " 
Then she ran and flung up the window, and said, 
"Why, so it was,  and that she had been in the 
house all day, and had not noticed the weather. 

She excused herself and the room for being in 
such a state ; she said she was ashamed to be caught 
in such a looking dress, but they were not expecting 
company, and she did suppose Manda Grier would 
have given her time to put the room to rights a 
little. He could not understand why she said all 
this, for the whole room was clean, and Statira her 
self was beautifully dressed in the same dress that 
she had worn the night before, or one just like 
it; and after she had put up the window, Manda 
Grier said, " S tira Dudley, do you want to kill your 
self ? " and ran and pulled aside the curtain in the 
corner, and took down the dolman from among other 
clothes that hung there, and threw it on Statira 's 
shoulders, who looked as pretty as a pink in it. But 



 

she pretended to be too hot, and wanted to shrug it 
off, and Manda Grier called out, " Mr. Barker ! will 
you make her keep it on f and Lemuel sat dumb 
and motionless, but filled through with a sweet 
pleasure. 

"He tried several times to ask them if they had 
been robbed on the way home last night, as he had 
done in the scene he had dramatised ; but he could 
not get out a word except that it had been pretty 
warm all day. 

Statira said, " I think it 's been a very warm fall," 
and Manda Grier said, "I think the summer 's goin 
to spend the winter with us," and they all three 
laughed. 

" What speeches you do make, Manda Grier," said 
Statira. 

" Well, anything better than Quaker meeting,
say," retorted Manda Grier ; and then they were all 
three silent, and Lemuel thought of his clothes, and 
how fashionably both of the girls were dressed. 

" I guess," said Statira, " it'll be a pretty sickly 
winter, if it keeps along this way. They say a green 
Christmas makes a fat grave-yard." 

" I guess you'll see the snow fly long before 
Christmas," said Manda Grier, "or Thanksgiving 
either." 

" I guess so too," said Lemuel, though he did not 
like to seem to take sides against Statira. 

She laughed as if it were a good joke, and said, 
" Tain tbut about a fortnight now till Thanksgiving 
anyway." 



 

" If it comes a good fall of snow before Thanks- 
givin , won't you come round and give us a sleigh-ride, 
Mr. Barker ?" asked Manda Grier. 

They all laughed at her audacity, and Lemuel said, 
Yes, he would ; and she said, " We'll give you a piece 
of real Willoughby Centre Mince-pie, if you will." 

They all laughed again. 
" Manda Grier !" said Statira, in protest. 
" Her folks sent her half a dozen last Thanksgivin ," 
persisted Manda Grier. 

" Manda/" pleaded Statira. 

Manda Grier sprang up and got Lemuel a folding 
chair. " You ain't a bit comfortable in that stiff old 
thing, Mr. Barker." 

Lemuel declared that he was perfectly comfortable, 
but she would not be contented till he had changed, 
and then she said, " Why don't you look after your 
company, S tira Dudley? I should think you'd be 
ashamed." 

Lemuel 's face burned with happy shame, and Sta 
tira, who was as red as he was, stole a look at him, 
that seemed to say that there was no use trying to 
stop Manda Grier. But when she went on, " I don't 
know but it 's the fashion to Willoughby Centre," 
they both gave way again, and laughed more than 
ever, and Statira said, " Well, Manda Grier, what do 
you 's pose Mr. Barker'll think?" 

She tried to be sober, but the wild girl set her and 
Lemuel off laughing when she retorted, " Guess he'll 
think what he did when he was brought up in court 
for highway robbery." 



 

Manda Grier sat upright in her chair, and acted as 
if she had merely spoken about the weather. He 
knew that she was talking that way just to break the 
ice, and though he would have given anything to be 
able to second her, he could not. 

"How you do carry on, Manda Grier," said Statira, 
as helpless as he was. 

"Guess I got a pretty good load to carry !" said 
Manda Grier. 

They all now began to find their tongues a little, 
and Statira told how one season when her mother 
took boarders she had gone over to the Pastures with 
a party of summer-folks on a straw-ride and picked 
blueberries. She said she never saw the berries as 
thick as they were there. 

Lemuel said he guessed he knew where the 
place was; but the fire had got into it last year, 
and there had not been a berry there this summer. 

Statira said, " What a shame !" She said there were 
some Barkers over East Willoughby way ; and she 
confessed that when he said his name was Barker, 
and he was from Willoughby Pastures, that night in 
the station, she thought she should have gone 
through the floor. 

Then they talked a little about how they had both 
felt, but not very much, and they each took all the 
blame, and would not allow that the other was the 
least to blame. Statira said she had behaved like & 
perfect coot all the way through, and Lemuel said 
that he guessed he had been the coot, if there 
was any. 



 

"I guess there was a pair of yon," said Manda 
Grier; and at this association of them in Manda 
Grier 's condemnation, he could see that Statira was 
blushing, though she hid her face in her hands, for 
her ears were all red. 

He now rose and said he guessed he would have 
to be going ; but when Manda Grier interposed and 
asked, "Why, what 's your hurry ?" he said he guessed 
he had not had any, and Statira laughed at the wit 
of this till it seemed to him she would perish. 

"Well, then, you set" right straight down again," 
said Manda Grier, with mock severity, as if he were 
an obstinate little boy ; and he obeyed, though he 
wished that Statira had asked him to stay too. 

" Why, the land sakes ! " exclaimed Manda Grier, 
" have you been lettin him keep his hat all this while, 
S tira Dudley ? You take it right away from him ! " 
And Statira rose, all smiling and blushing, and said 

" Will you let me take your hat, Mr. Barker ? " as 
if he had just come in, and made him feel as if she 
had pressed him to stay. She took it and went and 
laid it on a stand across the room, and Lemuel thought 
he had never seen a much more graceful person. 
She wore a full Breton skirt, which was gathered 
thickly at the hips, and swung loose and free as she 
stepped. When she came back and sat down, letting 
the back of one pretty hand fall into the palm of the 
other in her lap, it seemed to him impossible that 
such an elegant young lady should be tolerating a 
person dressed as he was. 

"There!" began Manda Grier. "/ guess Mr. 



 

Barker won't object a great deal to our going on, if 
it is Sunday. S kind of a Sunday game, anyways. 
You posed to games on Sunday ] " 

"I don't know as I am," said Lemuel. 

" Now, Manda Grier, don't you ! " pleaded Statira. 

" Shall, too," persisted Manda. " I guess if there 's 
any harm in the key, there ain't any harm in the 
Bible, and so it comes out even. D you ever try 
your fate with a key and a Bible ] " she asked Lemuel. 

" I don't know as I did," he answered. 

"Well, it 's real fun, V its curious how it comes 
out, oftentimes. Well, I don't 's pose there 's any 
thing in it, but it is curious." 

" I guess we hadn't better," said Statira. " I don't 
believe Mr. Barker'll care for it." 

Lemuel said he would like to see how it was clone, 
anyway. 

Manda Grier took the key out of the door, and 
looked at it. "That key'll cut the leaves all to 
pieces." 

" Can't you find some other ? " suggested Statira. 

"I don't know but may be I could," said Manda 
Grier. " You just wait a half a second." 

Before Lemuel knew what she was doing, she 
flew out of the door, and he could hear her flying 
down the stairs. 

" Well, I' must say ! " said Statira, and then neither 
she nor Lemuel said anything for a little while. At 
last she asked, "That window trouble you any ? " 

Lemuel said, " Not at all," and he added, " Perhaps 
it 's too cold for you ? " 



 

" Oh no," said the girl, " I can't seem to get any 
thing too cold for me. I' m the greatest person for 
cold weather ! I' m real glad it 's comin winter. We 
had the greatest time, last winter," continued Statira, 
" with those English sparrows. Used to feed em 
crumbs, there on the window-sill, and it seemed as 
if they got to know we girls, and they'd hop right 
inside, if you'd let em. Used to make me feel kind 
of creepy to have em. They say it 's a sign of death 
to have a bird come into your room, and I was 
always for drivin em out, but Manda, she said she 
guessed the Lord didn't take the trouble to send 
birds round to every one, and if the rule didn't work 
one way it didn't work the other. You believe in 
signs ? " 

" I don't know as I do, much. Mother likes to 
see the new moon over her right shoulder, pretty 
well," said Lemuel. 

"Well, I declare," said Statira, "that 's just the 
way with my aunt. Now you're  up here," she said, 
springing suddenly to her feet, " I want you should 
see what a nice view we got from our window." 

Lemuel had it on his tongue to say that he hoped 
it was not going to be his last chance ; he believed he 
would have said it if Manda Grier had been there ; 
but now he only joined Statira at the window, and 
looked out. They had to stoop over, and get pretty 
close together, to see the things she wished to show 
him, and she kept shrugging her sack on, and once 
she touched him with her shoulder. He said yes to 
everything she asked him about the view, but he saw 



 

very little of it. He saw that her hair had a shade 
of gold in its brown, and that it curled in tight little 
rings where it was cut on her neck, and that her skin 
was very white under it. When she touched him, 
that time, it made him feel very strange ; and when 
she glanced at him out of her blue eyes, he did not 
know what he was doing. He did not laugh as he 
did when Manda Grier was there.
