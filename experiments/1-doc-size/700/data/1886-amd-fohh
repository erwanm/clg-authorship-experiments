of shame rises to his face for Lloyd's sake. 

" There can be no mistake," she exclaims, with a bitter 
regret in her voice. " How could he be so blind, so fool- 
ish ? To put such a woman as that in the home of his 
proud race ! " 

No, there can be no mistake ; but he has felt all the 
time there was something of which' Lloyd was ashamed. 
So poorly do human hearts read each other, and then we 
pride ourselves upon the wisdom of our penetration, our 
unerring judgment. 

Agatha's marriage is the next event of note ; and it is 
one of the things long talked of in Westwater. It is in 
the church, which is almost strewn with flowers, scarce as 
they are at this season of the year. Basil gives her 
away, the bishop marries her, and the bridal train is like 
a pageant. There is a most elegant reception at the 
Wentworth mansion. The hall is lined with ferns and 
orange-trees in bloom, the air and scene are like midsummer, 
and the banquet perfection. Mrs. Wentworth is in her 
glory, Louise radiant, and even Olive is amiable. 

Fast on this follows news. Judge Minturn is informed 
of some future prospects for the estate. If, indeed, they 
should come to nought, the house and grounds go to "his 
dearly loved cousin, Basil Wentworth," or if the child 
should die in its early minority. There will be legacies 
to all the rest. If there should be no living heir, the 
place will be charged with a handsome annuity to Mrs. 
Lloyd Wentworth, who in that case might prefer not to 
return to America. 

Basil also has a friendly, half -humorous letter, in which 
allusions are made to the creaking gate and the lean dog. 
Lloyd is quite as well as usual, very happy of course, 
domesticated at Naples, indolent, enjoying all manner of 
radiant loveliness, breathing such marvellous air that it is 
a wonder one ever dies. 



 



 



 

The next news speeds through the cable. Lloyd Went- 
worth has finished his earthly pilgrimage. The remains 
will be brought to Westwater for interment, and Mrs. 
Lloyd Wentworth will follow when her health admits of 
such a journey. This is signed, '' Anson Gilbert." 

To say that Basil is shocked and surprised, are terms 
all too mild. He has fancied of late that Lloyd would 
live some years ; from the letter he had gathered no hint 
that he himself dreamed the end was near. Did he dream 
it indeed, or did he go out in the midst of happiness, as 
when some wandering breeze extinguishes a brilliant light 
in a ball-room, amid music anel dancing ? Basil can hardly 
believe it. He wanders about, seeing Lloyd everywhere, 
hearing his voice even, listening, watching. He cannot 
eat nor sleep. Does he regret anything ? Did not Lloyd's 
own hand place the bar of distance between them ? Would 
he do anything differently were it all to be done over 
again? 

For even now, with the face of his cousin haunting every 
shadowy comer, the soft dark eyes appealing to him, he 
still feels that he is the greatly injured one ; that if they 
could meet, he would have the most to forgive. He would 
do it grandly, magnanimously ; he does it now tenderly, 
generously, he believes. All the love that has been wrested 
from him by this stranger taken to the other's heait, all 
the confidence withheld, all the trust betrayed, and sad- 
dest of all, no last fond farewell, — it is very hard to bear. 
They have been like brothers. 

Can he forgive the woman who came between ? 

No, he cannot honestly. If she had been some sweet 
pure girl, who pitied Lloyd's unfortunate state, and was won 
into comforting with tender love ; but a scheming, design- 
ing, intriguing adventuress, with perhaps more than one 
scandal back of her — faugh ! the thing makes him sick. 

Olive takes the news with stolid fortitude. That she 
keeps her room for several days is nothing to be wondered 



 




at. Louise has been passing a few weeks with a school 
friend at New York. Mr. and Mrs. Stirling have spent a 
month at Washington, and are now making a tour of the 
most notable Southern cities. 

But they are all gathered together when Lloyd Went- 
worth comes home for the last time. The coflSn stands in 
the darkened hall, sweet with jasmine and the pungent 
flavor of heliotrope, and they are gathered around it in 
momning robes listening to the solemn service. They 
have all loved him like a brother, and each heart is deeply 
touched. 

They lay him to rest in the old family burying-ground, 
where generations of Wentworths are sleeping, beside his 
mother, whose brief life was shorter than his own. It is 
brown and leafless now, but there is a hint of spring in the 
air, and erelong all will be abloom. Doris's heart would 
break if she could see it now, after her sunny, joyous 
Naples. 

That ]Mr. Gilbert makes himself a man of great impor- 
tance goes without saying. There is a sealed packet for 
Judge Mintum, which he delivers with a great show of 
authority. It is "my niece, Mrs. Wentworth," every- 
where. She is coming to Westwater to reside perma- 
nently, as soon as her removal will be considered safe, 
and her aunt will look after her and the house. 

'' We shall do this and that," declares Mr. Gilbert, with 
an air of authority ; but the Wentworths remind him by 
their hauteur that he is not master yet. Judge Minturn 
simply announces that nothing can be done until it is 
known whether there will be an heir to the estate or not. 
Until then, Basil Wentworth is not only trustee, but lawful 
tenant. 

Mr. Gilbert seems rather nonplussed by this plain 
statement. Still, his return is necessary, but he goes 
rather reluctantly. He longs to call Wentworth to an 
accounting, and his fingers itch to handle the income of 



 




the estate. If Doris's child lives, he will insist upon the 
guardianship. 

On what a slender thread it all hangs I 

'' That odious man ! " Mrs. Wentworth almost shrieks, 
when he is gone. ^^Mrs. Lessing was quite right about 
them." 

Basil shuts his lips hard. It is in such hands as these 
the Wentworth estate, the pride of the whole country 
round, will go. It is utter desecration. Were he rich, not 
one foot of it should they possess. He would pour out 
gold like water to redeem it, were the gold his. How can 
he make a fortune ? He is wild, desperate. 

Then one slender hope goes out in darkness. There is 
a son born to heir the Wentworth estate, a strong healthy 
child. Mrs. Wentworth is doing well, and will soon be 
on her way home. That is the cruellest word in the an- 
nouncement. Home, to such a schemer ! 

The house at Larch Avenue is put in order, and beauti- 
fied with many treasures that have dwelt serenely in the 
Wentworth mansion so long that when they are gone out 
of their places it is like new deaths. And now it is that 
Olive, who has borne her sorrow jealously by herself, gives 
way to her passionate love and grief, and declares that 
nothing shall force her from the home that was his. For 
nights together she has not slept, until her poor brain goes 
wild with the endless longing and thinking, and fever 
brings on delirium. Mrs. Wentworth is amazed at the 
revelation, but finds that to Basil it is no surprise. 

"If she could have married him!" she cries. ''0h, 
Basil ! would he have refused her ? " 

'' She never was a favorite with him, you know. She 
was too vehement, too ungentle ; and he was so fond of 
harmony and beauty. If he had repulsed any overtures 
of tenderness, it would have been worse for her than it 
is now.'' 

Still the mother sighs. 



 



 



 

Olive is taken to her olden home, raging with fever, 
and placed in the hands of a competent nurse. Every- 
ihing is made ready for the flitting. When the telegram 
comes, Basil takes a last, long farewell of the nooks and 
haunts that have been so dear. It is something nobler 
than the mere love of possession. The spirits of his dead 
and gone ancestors seem to have come to a re-creation in 
him. He has no ambition for fame, no desire to distin- 
guish himself in business, to build up a great house or a 
great fortune. He is nature's child. Every field, every 
tree, every dumb animal is dear to him. 

How many evenings he has wandered under these 
magnificent overarching trees, where stars shine dimly 
through, and dreamed, — sweet, confused snatches they 
were, pictures of the evening of life mostly, of sons 
and daughters growing up around him, of glad, eager 
voices, of content with work well done, and of its high 
reward, in which is mingled no feverish strife, no betrayal 
of honor and honesty, and all that a man holds dear. A 
bitter smile crosses his face. He is to be thrust out of 
paradise, for no fault of his own. 

" You will reign here after me." How the falsely sweet 
words come back to him ! He has sowed, that a stranger 
shall come in and reap. He has toiled and planned and 
spent the best years of his young manhood, that the 
advantage may go to a woman who will no more under- 
stand its true or ennobling purpose than a stock or a 
stone. 

" They will soon be here," Mrs. Wentworth says, look- 
ing at her watch. 

" I cannot stay." His voice is hoarse, his face flushed 
with the struggle. '' My welcome can add little to their 
happiness; indeed, Mr. Gilbert will be grateful for my 
absence." Then he strides through the hall, and goes out 
of the house so dear to him. He will not see Lloyd Went- 
worth's widow imtil he is compelled so to do. 



 



 



 

Mrs. Wentworth meets them alone. She takes a much 
more critical survey of Doris thaa the young mother 
imagines. Then, when they have been despatched to their 
rooms, she sweeps out majestically, without a lingering 
look. 

" He might as well have mamed Olive," she says, that 
evening, to Basil, '' for any beauty there is about her. A 
pale, washed-out little thing, with yellow hair. I do not 
see how she ever had the spirit to get herself talked about 
in a scandal. I devoutly pray that the Conynghams may 
not run across her, and start the story afresh." 



 



 



CHAPTER IX. 

TOU SHALL NOT CHOOSE FOR ME. 

Now that Mrs. Lloyd Wentworth has reached "West- 
water, Judge Minturn appoints a day to read the will. 
No one is present but Doris and the Gilberts. Three 
days have elapsed, and she has not seen one of her hus- 
band's relatives, except that hasty glance at his aunt. 
She is somewhat rested, but paler and thinner than when 
Lloyd Wentworth found her at the little inn at Novara. 

Judge Minturn is a fine, well-preserved man, nearing 
seventy, with a rather stern aspect for business, but his 
social mien is charming. It is the former he wears now. 
To him these people are on a par with swindlers, and he 
is sorry there is no law to punish them. 

The will has been carefully made, that is evident. Even 
if it had not, here are wife and child, true, lawful heirs. 
To disprove the marriage, or question the birth of the 
child, would be too serious and too disgraceful for his 
relatives to attempt. 

The child is made heir to the Wentworth estates. A 
Aower portion is set aside for Doris, to be paid to her 
while she lives. In case of the child not living, or dying 
before it should attain its majority, the Wentworth house, 
with its old furnitui-e and plate, its family portraits, and 
various other matters, are to go to " my dearly loved 
cousin, Basil Wentworth." Basil Wentworth and Doris 
are appointed the child's guardians; and for five years 
Basil is requested to act as he has heretofore, general 
manager of the estates, and ample provision is made for 
his remuneration. Wentworth and Judge Minturn are 
appointed executors. 



 



 



 

Then follow various bequests and remembrances. To 
Mrs. Gilbert the sum of five thousand dollars, but of Mr. 
Gilbert there is no mention. His face flushes with vexa- 
tion, and he drums on the table near him in an impatient 
manner. 

Judge Mintum annoimces that the will is to be offered 
for probate. 

'' I do object to some of its clauses " ; and Mr. Gil- 
bert rises pompously. '' In the first place, if the child 
should die, my niece, as his natural heir, should reap some 
benefit. The provisions are plainly unjust. Then I 
demand a share in the guardianship of the child." 

Judge Mintum glances at Doris. She flushes, and 
raises her eyes timidly. 

''Mrs. Wentworth is the proper one to object,'' he 
returns, dryly, fixing his eyes upon her in the way that 
compels an answer. 

"I — "she hesitates and trembles, — it is so hard to 
take courage all alone. " I should like to have it exactly 
as my — as Mr. Wentworth wished." 

With that reply she has won Judge Minturn's heart. 

'' You could object," he says, more to prove her mettle 
tiian from any desire to have her try litigation. '' Did 
your husband consult you, and did you agree to your 
present income in lieu of all other rights ? " 

Anson Gilbert metaphorically pricks up his ears at 
this. Doris has other rights, and they have been illegally 
wrested from her. He has Shylock's early triumph in his 
premafure Daniel, though without the Jew's vindictive- 
ness. Of course, Doris never agreed. 

'' I wanted — " Doris turns pale and red, and the soft 
lips quiver, the eyes dix)op, until the long lashes, so much 
darker than her hair, seem to sweep her varying cheeks, 
— '' I wanted Mr. Wentworth to do as he thought right." 

''You consented. You were informed?" There is a 
sort of judicial severity in his tone. 



 



 



 

"Yes; that is, I might not have known all perhaps, 
but — I was satisfied." 

" In behalf of my niece, I shall file a caveat to the 
will," Gilbert exclaims, decisively. " She is under age 
herself ; she has given up her rights in ignorance ; and I 
should be the lawful male guardian of her child. It is an 
imjust, I might say infamous will, and it shall not stand." 

He brings his fist down with such force on the table that 
the jardiniere rocks to and fro. 

Doris glances up with affright, and her eyes of winter- 
heaven appeal to Judge Mintui-n in pathetic f riendlessness. 

" This is all my duty to-day. You may think better of 
any trouble when you come to understand matters more 
clearly, Mr. Gilbert. Mrs. Wentwoi'th, I have been the 
family adviser for three generations, though I am aware 
that does not entitle me to your confidence. I looked 
after your husband's interest as I would that of a son. I 
certainly shall not see his child wronged in any manner. 
If you choose to rely upon me, I am at your service any 
time." 

With this he bows impressively. He is the kind of man 
who carries weight in every motion, every gesture or look, 
and against whom Mr. Gilbert feels he can make no 
immediate headway by argument. He has been so taken 
by surprise that he must collect his forces and reconnoitre 
the enemy's outpost, and this will be a work of days. 

Doris says faintly, " Thank you." Mr. GUbert, with 
passion, yet stiffly, '' You will hear from me again." 

Judge Minturn steps into his light buggy and drives 
away. '' A dove in a wolf's lair," he muses. '' How did 
it happen ? " And now he has a curious sympathy with 
buried Lloyd Wentworth. He has daughters of his own, 
but no sons, and his heart is rather tender toward a cer- 
tain class of womenkind. 

Anson Gilbert looks at his wife's niece with contempt, 
and then bursts out with, — 



 



 



 

'' Doris, you are a fool ! " 

" Anson ! " and his wife endeavors to take the arm of 
her irascible husband. She is as much disappointed in 
one way, but she has been trained to greater patience, and 
is more used to stratagems. 

" Yes, she has been a weak, silly idiot ; I will say it, 
Emily! She should have asked advice of some one. 
And Lloyd Wentworth is proved a selfish, dishonorable 
scoundrel ! " 

Up to this moment of her life, Doris has been timid, 
shrinking, passive. She has not been trained in any of 
the traditions of independence or even womanly strength. 
It seems to her quite as if Mr. Gilbert had opened her 
husband's coflSn, and struck him a blow in the face that 
she can never, never forgive, because the other lay help- 
less. She walks up to him ; her eyes are black and fear- 
less now. 

''You have said what is utterly false! Lloyd Went- 
worth had a right to do what he liked with his own. If 
my baby dies, I shall be glad to have ihe estate go to the 
Wentworths ; I have no right to it." 

" You are a fool ! " he repeats. 

" Doris, come. You shall not listen ! " 

Mrs. Gilbert drags her from the room almost before 
Doris is aware. 

" Such excitements are dreadful for you," she begins in 
her sympathizing tone, that at another time might have won 
Doris. " For your child's sake, you must keep tranquil." 

They go up-stairs together. Marie has just lain the 
sleeping baby on the bed. He thrives wonderfully; is 
round, rosy, plump, and strong. 

"You may go, Marie," Mrs. Gilbert announces, in a 
tone of command rather than permission. JShe must keep 
her hold on Doris in any event ; and she has a feeling now 
that the bird, hopping about so gently hitherto, has sud- 
denly found its wings. 



 



 



 

Doris is marble pale and cold, and tries to rouse herself 
for a struggle ; but it seems as if real feeling had gone out 
of both soul and body. 

" I am very sorry your uncle has so forgotten himself," 
— and the term "your uncle," with the inflection, seems 
to dispossess Mrs. Gilbert of him, and saddle the relation- 
ship entirely upon Doris, — " but he is very deeply h,urt, 
and I must say he has not been treated rightly. He is 
your only male relative, and the Wentworths have plainly 
shown that they care nothing for you. They have not 
even sent to inquire about you ; and I am sure Mrs. 
Wentworth was all arrogance the day we came. I have 
seen plenty of such people. Do you suppose they will 
study your interest or your pleasure at all ? You will see 
that they will endeavor to set up the whole town against 
you, and the only way is to join together and show them 
we do not care ; to make our own society. I know / can 
soon collect a little circle of people around us. And you 
really have no one to stand up for you, to fight for you. 
but just us. He ought to be the baby's guardian. As 
the case stands, they can manage all their own way ; and 
that stiff old Judge Minturn is altogether on their side, as 
you can plainly see. You must have some one." 

Doris stands like a statue. The words trickle down like 
rain falling on ice. 

"You must see," Mrs. Gilbert continues, impatiently, 
" that you have a life interest in one third of the real 
estate, and I would make a fight for it. No wonder he 
was indignant. It is a monstrous wrong." 

" I shall fight for nothing," Doris says, in a clear pas- 
sionless tone. " Everything shall remain just as my hus- 
band wished." 

" Doris ! " in wild surprise. 

"Yes," the young widow goes on, unmoved. "No 
one shall stir a finger to have things different, if I can help 
it. I have quite enough. I am content. I do not want 



 



 



 

society. One comer of this great house is suflScient for 
me. Oh, I wish they had not gone out of it ! They might 
have remained. It will be such a long, long time before 
baby can inherit ; twenty-one years — think of it I " and 
there is a desperate, dreary pathos in her tone. " But 
everything shall be as his father wishes." 

" Doris Wentworth, you shall listen to a little reason. 
You owe me some respect." Mrs. Gilbert is waxing 
angry now. " You had not a penny, nor a friend, nor a 
home, when I took you from school. You never could 
have made such a marriage but for my management. He, 
like other men, would have been satisfied to dawdle after 
a girl and make half love, and then fly off to some other 
field. But I said to myself, ' You can't try that kind of 
chaff on me, young man ; I mean business ! ' And I did it, 
too. That night you were out with the Livingstones, I 
brought him to the point. It was not altogether your 
sweetness. Miss Doris, but some wisdom and far-sight 
on my part. I did not mean to let such a fortune slip 
through my fingers, and it shall not slip through yours 
now." 

'' Did you ask him to marry me ? " 

There is a curious flickering light about Doris's eyes, 
a mortal paleness settles about her mouth, as if she might 
faint. There is a horror in her soul that makes her long 
to fly back to that night in Venice, and when she is clean, 
happy, and innocent, drop into the canal, and float out to 
the sea. 

'' Well, I put it so that he could not refuse. You owe 
all this to me." 

" Aunt, I wish you had killed me flrst. Oh, my God ! 
what shall I do ? I have no right ; I am worse than — " 

" Doris Wentworth, hush ! " She takes her by the 
shoulder and does give her a shake. " I shall think, like 
your uncle, that you are demented I What matter how the 
marriage was made ? You have been the wife, and you 



 



 



are the widow, of Lloyd Wentworth. I left nothing at 
loose ends, nothing that could be disputed." 

" And I was innocent !" she exclaims, hysterically. 

" Doris, you know nothing about the world. You were 
just a child when I took you from school. Parents and 
friends on the Continent always arrange marriages. There 
is nothing reprehensible, nothing derogatory in it; but 
there might have been in your travelling about with a 
young man you did not marry. And you ought to be 
grateful to me, instead of throwing your high-flown non- 
sense at my head. But we shall fight for you, and get 
back your rights. You need not be afraid. You are not 
capable of taking care of yourself." 

Doris Wentworth walks over to the bed where the baby 
lies, and kneels down, bowing her face on its soft dress, 
that is perfumed with the odor of violets. Lloyd loved 
the fragrance so much. She cannot pray, she cannot even 
think ; but the great trouble ascends to God, if it has no 
words for wings. What she wants is to make some 
amends for the terrible wrong they have all done to the 
cousin he loved as a brother. She is not jealous of any 
wifely love. She has no sense of anything being withheld. 
He loved her, and gave her everything with his love. Her 
experience has not been wide enough to make money any 
factor in her life. 

Mrs. Gilbert goes out with a swelling heart, and shuts 
the door. To her Doris is incomprehensibly silly. She 
has never experienced any of this super-sensitiveness. 
She has accepted favors, very great favors sometimes, 
with no real qualms of self-esteem ; rather she has blamed 
the hard fate that made them so very acceptable. She 
has often fancied what she would do for people if she 
were rich, and no doubt she would be lavish, until she 
has come to believe the very desire worthy of a reward. 
She has made marriages before, some that have not turned 
out well, but at the time the young woman benefited was 



 



 



 

rery grateful. Here it has all been much better than her 
wildest dreams, and Doris would rather be dead. Is she 
really sound in her brain? Her father was peculiar. 
There is so much more need, then, that some one should 
look sharply after her interests. 

She and Mr. Gilbert hav^ already discussed many 
points, and were only waiting for the reading of the 
will. Emily Gilbert has not abounding faith in her hus- 
band. She has seen times when she would have been glad 
to have the separation final, yet it must be confessed the 
husbands of many of her friends are hardly to be preferred. 
She might do no better a second time, and it does give 
one a more assured position. A widow is sometimes eyed 
rather suspiciously by a friend who has an attractive or 
generous husband ; a married woman can accept benefits 
and favors without rousing suspicions. 

The wandering, scheming, shifting sort of life has 
suddenly opened into a pleasant, restful haven. If Mr.
