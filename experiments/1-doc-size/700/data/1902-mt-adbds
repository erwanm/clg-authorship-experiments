were the only ones in the twenty-four 
which he looked forward to with eager- 
ness and spent in happiness. 
He thought of poison. No — that 
would not serve; the inquest would 
reveal where it was procured and who 
had procured it. He thought of a shot 
in the back in a lonely place when 
Flint would be homeward-boiind at 
midnight — his unvarying hour for 
the trip. No — somebody might be 
near, and catch him. He thought 
of stabbing him in his sleep. No — 
he might strike an inefficient blow, 
and Flint would seize him. He ex- 
amined a hundred different ways — 
none of them would answer; for in 
even the very obscurest and secretest 
of them there was always the fatal _ 
defect of a risk, a chance, a possible 
risk in that he might be found out. He 
would have none of that. 
But he was patient, endlessly 
patient. There was no hurry, he 
said to himself. He would never 
leave Flint till he left him a corpse; 
there was no hurry — he would find 
the way. It was somewhere, and 
he would endure shame and pain 
and misery until he found it. Yes, 
somewhere there was a way which 
'oenge would leave not a trace, not even the 
faintest clew to the murderer — there 
was no hurry — he would find that 
way, and then — oh, then, it would 
just be good to be alive! Meantime 
he would diligently keep up his rep- 
utation for meekness; and also, as 
always theretofore, he would allow 
no one to hear him say a resentful 
or offensive thing about his oppressor. 
Two days before the before-men- 
tioned October morning Flint had 
bought some things, and he and Fet- 
lock had brought them home to Flint's 
cabin: a fresh box of candles, which 
they put in the corner; a tin can of mlteHal 
blasting-powder, which they placed 
upon the candle-box; a keg of blast- 
ing-powder, which they placed under 
Flint's bunk; a huge coil of fuse, 
which they hung on a peg. Fet- 
lock reasoned that Flint's mining 
operations had outgrown the pick, 
and that blasting was about to begin 
now. He had seen blasting done, 
and he had a notion of the process, 
but he had never helped in it. His 
conjecture was right — blasting - time 
had come. In the morning the pair 
carried fuse, drills, and the powder- 
can to the shaft; it was now eight 
feet deep, and to get into it and out 
of it a short ladder was used. They 
descended, and by command Fetlock 
ls held the drill— without any instruc- 
tions as to the right way to hold it — 
and Flint proceeded to strike. The 
sledge came down; the drill sprang 
out of Fetlock's hand, almost as a 
matter of course. 
"You mangy son of a nigger, is 
that any way to hold a drill? Pick 
it up! Stand it up! There — hold 
fast. D you! I'll teach youi'' 
At the end of an hour the drilling 
was finished. 
"Now, then, charge it." 
The boy started to pour in the pow- 
der. 
"Idiot!'' . 
A heavy bat on the jaw laid the 
lad out. 
"Get up! You can't lie snivelling 
there. Now, then, stick in the fuse 
first. Now put in the powder. Hold 
on, hold on! Are you going to fill 
the hole all up? Of all the sap-headed 
milksops I — Put in some dirt! Put 
in some gravel! Tamp it down! 
Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! 
get out of the way!'' He snatched 
the iron and tamped the charge him-  
self, meantime cursing and blaspheming 
like a fiend. Then he fired the 
fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and 
ran fifty yards away. Fetlock follow- 
ing. They stood waiting a few min- 
utes, then a great volume of smoke 
and rocks burst high into the air 
with a thunderous explosion; after 
a little there was a shower of descending 
stones; then all was serene 
again. 
"I wish to God you'd been in itl'' 
remarked the master. 
They went down the shaft, cleaned 
it out, drilled another hole, and put 
in another charge. 
Timing "Look herel How much fuse are 
fuse yo proposing to waste? Don't you 
know how to time a fuse?" 
"No, sir." 
"You don't! Well, if you don't 
beat anything I ever saw!" 
He climbed out of the shaft and 
spoke down: 
" Well, idiot, are you going to be all 
day? Cut the fuse and Hght it!" 
The trembling creature began, 
"If you please, sir, I — " 
" You talk back to me ? Cut it and 
light it!" 
The boy cut and lit. 
"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! 
I wish you were in — " 
In his rage he snatched the ladder 
out of the shaft and ran. The boy 
was aghast. 
"Oh, my God! Help! Help! Oh, 
save me!" he implored. "Oh, what 
can I do! What can I do!" 
He backed against the wall as 
tightly as he could; the sputtering 
fuse frightened the voice out of him; 
his breath stood still; he stood gazing 
and impotent; in two seconds, three 
seconds, four, he would be flying se to 
death 
toward the sky torn to fragments. 
Then he had an inspiration. He 
sprang at the fuse and severed the 
inch of it that was left above ground, 
and was saved. 
He sank down limp and half life- 
less with fright, his strength all 
gone; but he muttered with a deep 
joy: 
"He has learnt me! I knew there 
fa,.   way, if I would wait' 
After a matter of five minutes Buck- 
ner stole to the shaft, looking wor- 
ried and uneasy, and peered down 
into it. He took in the situation; he 
saw what had happened. He low- 
ered the ladder, and the boy dragged 
himself weakly up it. He was very 
white. His appearance added some- 
thing to Buckner's uncomfortable 
regret and sympathy which sat upon 
him awkwardly from lack of prac- 
tice: 
"It was an accident, you know. 
Don't say anything about it to any- 
body ; I was excited, and didn't notice 
what I was doing. You're not look- 
ing well; you've worked enough for 
to-day ; go down to my cabin and eat 
what you want, and rest. It's just 
an accident, you know, on account 
of my being excited." 
"It scared me' said the lad, as he ' 
started away; "but I learnt something,
so I don't mind it." 
"Damned easy to please!" muttered 
Buckner, following him with his eye. 
"I wonder if he'll tell? Mightn't 
he? ... I wish it had killed him." 
The boy took no advantage of 
his holiday in the matter of rest- 
Fggf ing; he employed it in work, eager 
. and feverish and happy work. A 
thick growth of chaparral extended 
down the mountain - side clear to 
Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's 
labor was done in the dark intrica- 
cies of that stubborn growth ; the rest 
of it was done in his own shanty. 
At last all was complete, and he 
said: 
"If he's got any suspicions that 
I'm going to tell on him, he won't 
keep them long, to-morrow. He will 
see that I am the same milksop as I 
always was — all day and the next. 
And the day after to-morrow night 
there'll be an end of him, and nobody 
will ever guess who finished him up 
nor how it was done. He dropped 
me the idea his own self, and that's 
odd." 
HE next day came and 
went. 
It is now almost mid- 
night, and in five min- 
utes the new morning will begin. The 
scene is in the tavern billiard-room. 
Rough men in rough clothing, slouch 
hats, breeches stuffed into boot-tops, 
some with vests, none with coats, are 
grouped about the boiler -iron stove, 
which has ruddy cheeks and is dis- 
tributing a grateful warmth ; the bill- 
iard-balls are clacking; there is no 
other sound — that is, within ; the wind 
is fitfully moaning without. The men 
look bored; also expectant. A hulk- 
ing, broad-shouldered miner, of mid- 
dle age, with grizzled whiskers, and 
an unfriendly eye set in an imsociable 
face, rises, slips a coil of fuse upon 
his arm, gathers up some other per- 
sonal properties, and departs without 
word or greeting to anybody. It is 
Flint Buckner. As the door closes 
behind him a buzz of talk breaks 
out. 
"The regularest man that ever 
was,'' said Jake Parker, the black- method 
smith ; *" you can tell when it's twelve 
just by him leaving, without looking 
at your Waterbury." 
"And it's the only virtue he's got, 
as fur as I know' said Peter Hawes, 
miner. 
" He's just a blight on this society' 
on society said _ Wells - Far go's man, Ferguson 
" If I was running this shop I'd make 
him say something, some time or 
other, or vamos the ranch." This 
with a suggestive glance at the bar- 
keeper, who did not choose to see it, 
since the man under discussion was 
a good customer, and went home 
pretty well set up, every night, with 
refreshments furnished from the bar. 
"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, 
"does any of you boys ever recollect 
of him asking you to take a drink?" 
''Him? Flint Buckner? Oh, 
Laura!" 
This sarcastic rejoinder came in a 
spontaneous general outburst in one 
form of words or another from the 
crowd. After a brief silence, Pat 
Riley, miner, said: 
"He's the 15 -puzzle, that cuss. The 
And his boy's another one. I can't puzzle 
make them out." 
"Nor anybody else," said Ham 
Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles,
how are you going to rank up 
that other one? When it comes to 
A I right-down solid mysteriousness, 
he laj's over both of them. Easy — 
don't he?" 
"You bet!" 
Everybody said it. Every man but 
one. He was the new-comer — Pe- 
terson. He ordered the drinks all 
round, and asked who No. 3 might 
be. All answered at once, ''Archy 
Stillman!'' 
"Is he a mystery?'' asked Peter- 
"Is te a mystery? Is Archy Still- 
man a mystery?'' said Wells-Fargo's 
man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth 
dimension's foolishness to him." 
For Ferguson was learned. 
Peterson wanted to hear all about 
him; everybody wanted to tell him; 
everybody began. But Billy Stevens, 
the barkeeper, called the house to or- 
der, and said one at a time was best. 
He distributed the drinks, and ap- 
pointed Ferguson to lead. Fergu- 
son said: 
"Well, he's a boy. And that is 
just about all we know about him. 
You can pump him till you are tired; 
it ain't any use; you won't get any- 
thing. At least about his intentions, 
or line of business, or where he's 
from, and such things as that. And 
as for getting at the nature and get- 
up of his main big chief mystery, 
why, he'll just change the subject, 
that's all. You can gtiess till you're 
black in the face— it's your privilege 
— but suppose you do, where do you 
arrive at ? Nowhere, as near as I 
can make out." 
" What is his big chief one?" 
"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. 
Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take 
your choice — grown-ups, twenty-five; 
children and servants, half price. Now 
I'll tell you what he can do. You 
can start here, and just disappear; 
hide y  S< ad hide wherever you 
'? want to, I don't care where it is, nor 
how far — and he'll go straight and 
put his finger on you." 
'You don't mean it!" 
'' I just do, though. Weather's noth- 
ing to him — elemental conditions is 
nothing to him — he don't even take 
notice of them." 
"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? 
Hey?" 
"It's all the same to him. He 
don't give a damn." 
"Oh, 503;— including fog, per'aps?" 
" Fog I he's got an eye 't can plunk 
through it like a bullet." 
"Now, boys, honor bright, what's 
he giving me?" 
"It's a fact I" they all shouted. 
''Go on, Weils-Fargo." 
"Well, sir, you can leave him here, 
chatting with the boys, and you can 
slip out and go to any cabin in this 
camp and open a book — yes, sir, 
a dozen of them — and take the page 
in your memory, and he'll start out 
and go straight to that cabin and 
open every one of them books at the 
right page, and call it ofiF, and never 
make a mistake." 
" He must be the devil !"  
"More than one has thought it. " 
Now ril tell you a perfectly wonder- 
ful thing that he done. The other 
night he—" 
There was a sudden great murmur 
of sounds outside, the door flew open, 
and an excited crowd burst in, with 
the camp's one white woman in the 
lead and crying: 
"My child! my child! she's lost 
l  and gone! For the love of God help 
'" me to find Archy Stillman; weVe 
himted everywhere!" 
Said the barkeeper: 
''Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, 
and don't worry. He asked for a 
bed three hours ago, tuckered out 
tramping the trails the way he's al- 
ways doing, and went up stairs. Ham 
Sandwich, run up and roust him out; 
he's in No. 14." 
The youth was soon downstairs 
and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan 
for particulars. 
''Bless you, dear, there ain't any; 
I wish there was. I put her to sleep 
at seven in the evening, and when I 
went in there an hour ago to go to bed
myself, she was gone. I rushed for 
your cabin, dear, and you wasn't 
there, and Tve hunted for you ever 
since, at every cabin down the gulch, 
and now Tve come up again, and 
Fm that distracted and scared and 
heart-broke; but, thanks to God, Tve 
found you at last, dear heart, and 
you'll find my child. Come on I come 
quick !'' 
"Move right along; Fm with you, 
madam. Go to your cabin first." 
The whole company streamed out 
to join the hunt. All the southern 
half of the village was up, a hundred 
men strong, and waiting outside, a 
vague dark mass sprinkled with twin- 
kling lanterns. The mass fell into 
columns by threes and fours to ac- 
commodate itself to the narrow road, 
and strode briskly along southward 
in the wake of the leaders. In a 
few minutes the Hogan cabin was 
reached. 
"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Ho- 
gan; "there's where she was; it's 
where I laid her at seven o'clock; but 
where she is now, God only knows." 
" Hand me a lantern," said Archy. 
He set it on the hard earth floor 
and knelt by it, pretending to exam- 
ine the ground closely. "Here's her 
track," he said, touching the ground 
here and there and yonder with his 
finger. " Do you see?" 
Several of the company dropped 
upon their knees and did their best 
to see. One or two thought they 
discerned something hke a track; 
the others shook their heads and con- 
fessed that the smooth hard surface 
had no marks upon it which their 
eyes were sharp enough to discover. 
One said, " Maybe a child's foot could 
make a mark on it, but I don't see 
how." 
Young Stillman stepped outside, 
held the light to the ground, turned 
leftward, and moved along three steps. 
On the trail closely examining; then said,
"I've got the direction — come along; take 
the lantern, somebody." 
He strode off swiftly southward. 
The files following, swaying and bending 
in and out with the deep curves 
of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the 
mouth of the gorge was reached; 
before them stretched the sage-brush 
Following an plain, dim, vast, and vague. Stillman 
called a halt, saying, "We mustn't 
start wrong, now; we must take the 
direction again.'' He took a lantern 
and examined the ground for a matter 
of twenty yards; then said, "Come 
on; it's all right," and gave up the 
lantern. In and out among the sage- 
bushes he marched, a quarter of a 
mile, bearing gradually to the right; 
then took a new direction and made 
another great semicircle; then changed 
again and moved due west nearly 
half a mile — and stopped. 
"She gave it up, here, poor little 
chap. Hold the lantern. You can 
see where she sat' 
But this was in a slick alkali flat 
which was surfaced like steel, and no 
person in the party was quite hardy 
enough to claim an eyesight that 
could detect the track of a cushion 
on a veneer like that. The bereaved 
mother fell upon her knees and kissed 
the spot, lamenting. 
"But where is she, then?'' some 
one said. "She didn't stay here. 
We can see that much, anyway." 
Stillman moved about in a circle 
around the place, with the lantern, 
pretending to hunt for tracks. " Well ! ' ' 
he said presently, in an annoyed 
tone, "I don't understand it." He 
examined again. ''No use. She was 
here — that's certain; she never walked 
away from here — and that's certain. 
It's a puzzle; I can't make it out." 
The mother lost heart then. 
"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! 
some flying beast has got her. I'll 
never see her again!" 
"Ah, don't give up," said Archy. 
"We'll find her— don't give up." 
"God bless you for the words, 
Archy Stillman!" and she seized his 
hand and kissed it fervently. 
Peterson, the new-comer, whispered 
satirically in Ferguson's ear: 
"Wonderful performance to find 
this place, wasn't it? Hardly worth 
while to come so far, though; any 
other supposititious place would have 
answered just as well — hey?" 
Ferguson was not pleased with 
the innuendo. He said, with some 
warmth : ' 
"Do you mean to insinuate that 
the child hasn't been here? I tell 
you the child has been here! Now 
if you want to get yourself into as 
tidy a little fuss as — '' 
''All right!" sang out Stillman 
"Come, everybody, and look at this! 
It was right under our noses all the 
time, and we didn't see it' 
There was a general plunge for 
the ground at the place where the 
child was alleged to have rested, and 
many eyes tried hard and hopefully to 
see the thing that Archy's finger was 
resting upon. There was a pause, 
then a several-barrelled sigh of disappointment. 
Pat Riley and Ham 
Sandwich said, in the one breath: 
"What is it, Archy? There's nothing 
here.' 
"Nothing? Do you call that noth- 
ing?'' and he swiftly traced upon 
the ground a form with his finger. 
"There — don't you recognize it now? 
It's Injim Billy's track. He's got 
the child." 
"God be praised!" from the mother. 
"Take away the lantern. I've got 
the direction. Follow!" 
He started on a run, racing in and 
out among the sage-bushes a matter 
of three hundred yards, and disap- 
peared over a sand-wave; the others 
struggled after him, caught him up, 
and foimd him waiting. Ten steps 
 
away was a little wickieup, a dim 
and formless shelter of rags and old 
horse-blankets, a dull light showing 
through its chinks. 
''You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the 
lad. ''It's your privilege to be 
first." 
All followed the sprint she made 
for the wickieup, and saw, with her, 
the picture its interior afforded. Injun 
Billy was sitting on the ground; tost one 
the child was asleep beside him. The 
mother hugged it with a wild embrace, 
which included Archy Stillman, the 
grateful tears running down her face, 
and in a choked and broken voice 
she poured out a golden stream of 
that wealth of worshipping endear- 
ments which has its home in full
richness nowhere but in the Irish 
he. 
" I find her b3nneby it is ten oclock' 
Billy explained. " She 'sleep out yon- 
der, ve'y tired — face wet, been cry- 
Injan's' spose; fetch her home, feed her, 
she heap much hungry — go 'sleep.'
In her limitless gratitude the happy 
mother waived rank and hugged him 
too, calling him ''the angel of God 
in disguise." 
And he probably was in disguise 
if he was that kind of an official. He 
was dressed for the character. 
At half past one in the morning 
the procession burst into the village, 
singing " When Johnny Comes March- 
ing Home," waving its lanterns, and 
swallowing the drinks that were 
brought out all along its course. It  
concentrated at the tavern, and made  
a night of what was left of the morning. 
I 
HE next afternoon the 
village was electrified 
with an immense sen- 
sation. A grave and 
dignified foreigner of distinguished 
bearing and appearance had arrived 
at the tavern, and entered this for 
midable name upon the register: 
Sherlock Holmes. 
The news buzzed from cabin to 
cabin, from claim to claim; tools 
were dropped, and the town swarmed 
toward the centre of interest. A man 
passing out at the northern end of 
the village shouted it to Pat Riley, 
whose claim was the next one to 
Flint Buckner's. At that time Fet- 
lock Jones seemed to turn sick. He 
muttered to himself: 
" Uncle Sherlock I The mean luck 
of it I — that he should come just 
when , . ." He dropped into a rev- 
erie, and presently said to himself: 
"But what's the use of being afraid 
of him? Anybody that knows him 
the way I do knows he can't detect a 
crime, except when he plans it all out 
beforehand and arranges the clews 
and hires some fellow to commit 
it according to instructions. . . . 
Now there ain't going to he any clews 
this time — so, what show has he got? 
None at all. No, sir; everything's 
ready. If I was to risk putting it 
off. . . . No, I won't run any risk like 
that. Flint Buckner goes out of this 
world to-night, for sure." Then an- 
other trouble presented itself. "Un- 
cle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk 
home matters with me this evening, 
and how am I going to get rid of him? 
for I've got to be at my cabin a minute  
or two about eight o'clock." This 
was an awkward matter, and cost 
him much thought. But he found 
a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll 
go for a walk, and I'll leave him in 
the road a minute, so that he won't 
see what it is I do: the best way to 
throw a detective off the track, anyway, 
is to have him along when you 
are preparing the thing. Yes, that's 
the safest — I'll take him with me." 
Meantime the road in front of the 
tavern was blocked with villagers 
waiting and hoping for a glimpse of 
the g reat m an. But he kept his 
room, and did not appear. None 
but Ferguson, Jake Parker the black- 
smith, and Ham Sandwich had any 
luck. These enthusiastic admirers of 
the great scientific detective hired the 
tavern's detained - baggage lockup, 
which looked into the detective's room 
across a little alleyway ten or twelve 
feet wide, ambushed themselves in it, 
and cut some peep-holes in the win- 
dow-blind. Mr. Holmes's blinds were 
down; but by-and-by he raised them. 
It gave the spies a hair-Hfting but 
pleasurable thrill to find themselves 
face to face with the Extraordinary 
Man who had filled the world with 
the fame of his more than human 
ingenuities. There he sat — not a 
m3i:h, not a shadow, but real, alive, 
compact of substance, and almost 
within touching distance with the 
hand. 
''Look at that head!'' said Fergu- 
son, in an awed voice. ".By:£raciQus ! 
that's a head!'' 
"ybuTbetr said the blacksmith, 
with deep reverence. "Look at his 
nose! look at his eyes! Intellect? 
Just a battery of it!'' 
"And that paleness," said Ham 
Sandwich. ''Comes from thought — 
that's what it comes from. Hell! 
duffers like us .don't knoLwhat real 
thought is." 
"No more we don't' said Fergu- 
son. "What we take for thinking 
is just blubber-and-slush. " 
" Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And 
look at that frown — that's deep think- 
ing — away down, down, forty fathom 
into the bowels of things. He's on 
the track of something." 
"Well, he is, and don't you forget 
it. Say — look at that awful gravity 
— look at that pallid solemness — there 
ain't any corpse can lay over it." 
" No, sir, not for dollars ! And 
it's his'n by hereditary rights, too; 
he's been dead four times a'ready, 
and there's historyiior it. Three 
times natural, once by accident. Fve 
heard say he smells damp and colS, 
like a grave. And he — " 
""ShTlVatch him I There — he's 
got his thumb on the btmip on the 
near corner of his forehead, and his 
forefinger on the off one. His think- Grind- 
works is just 3.- grinding now, you bet - 
your other shirt." 
"That's so. And now he's gazing 
up toward heaven and stroking his 
mustache slow, and — '' 
"Now he has rose up standing, 
and is putting his clews together on 
his left fingers with his right finger. 
See? he touches the forefinger — now 
middle finger — now ring-finger — '* 
"Stuck!" 
"Look at him scowl! He can't 
seem to make out thxit clew. So he — '' 
"See him smile! — like a tiger — 
and tally off the other fingers like 
nothing! He's got it, boys; he's 
got it sure!" 
"Well, I should say! Td hate to 
be in that man's place that he's after." 
Mr. Holmes drew a table to the 
window, sat down with his back to 
the spies, and proceeded to write. 
The spies withdrew their eyes from 
the peep-holes, Ht their pipes, and 
settled themselves for a comfortable 
smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with
