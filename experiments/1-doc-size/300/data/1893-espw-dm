they 'll give you. Fleet is a good fellow. 
You'd have done well, Donald, if you'd have 
bespoken him for a father. He'd have 
taken more pains with you than I have, 
had more time, you know, not always on 
the go, paid you more attention. I'm 
going to speak to Baxter about this ; I 'll 



 

stop there on my way to the train, and put it 
through. You've made a fool of yourself, 
but it isn't so bad as it might be, Donald. 
You shall go to Fleet s. Come over here, 
nearer, and let me look at you. Upon my 
soul, you've grown tall since I saw you. I 
say, Donald, there 's too much champagne 
in your breath. Where have you been ? " 

" Calling on a young lady," replied Don 
uncomfortably enough. 

" A young lady ? " repeated his father, 
with a short, sarcastic laugh. " The ladies 
of a college town didn't give wines to the 
students in my day. I must look into this, 
sir ! " At this uneasy moment, Jamie Fleet 
quietly took his books and slipped out. It 
was too evident that things had reached a 
point where father and son must be left 
alone. 

When Jamie came back, he found that 
Mr. Marcy had gone. 

Don was alone in the room, sitting by the 
table, his arm upon it, his face hidden on 
his elbow. He did not change his position 
when his chum entered. Fleet came and sat 
down by him, with that unfailing, almost 
feminine tenderness which made him so dear 
to Don. 





" Well, Don ! " lie said pleasantly. 

The wretched boy acknowledged his pres 
ence by a slight kick beneath the table ; 
nothing more affectionate or articulate 
followed, but Jamie persisted, with that con 
tented power to ignore rebuff which belongs 
to real love alone. 

" Father gone ? Did he get off in time ? " 

Donald 's curly head, prone upon his fine 
coat-sleeve, nodded. 

" Did you go to the station with him ? " 

Don shook his head ; vigorously this time. 
Jamie perceived that this point was painful. 

" Wouldn't let you, would he ? I thought 
perhaps not. He was a good deal cut up." 

" He told me to go to the deuce," cried 
Don, suddenly jerking his head up. 

There were traces of tears on his flushed 
and worried face. 

" He told me to go to the deuce, and be 
done with it. My father never spoke like 
that to me before. He was awfully cut up, 
J. ! He was mortified. He felt ashamed of 
me. He'd taken lots of trouble to come on." 

" Couldn't you make your father under 
stand ? " asked Jamie anxiously. 

" Oh, I don't know," replied Don wearily. 
" He wouldn't shake hands with me when 



 

he went away. I hated to see father off 
so. It went against me awfully. He didn't 
look well, J., seemed to me. Did you 
notice ? I wish I could go home and see him 
again. But there 's this confounded 
rustication business." 

" Don't be too down," pleaded Jamie. 

" Oh, I am," said Don, with the cheerful 
ness of reviving expression. " I'm blue as 
they make em ! Why, J., I wasn't drunk, 
you know I wasn't ! " 

" No, indeed," said Jamie sympathetically. 

" I never got drunk in my life ! " urged 
Don. " I wouldn't be such a flat ! " 

" Of course you wouldn't," echoed Jamie. 
" But, Don, you did take something, you 
know. It isn't a good plan. It makes a 
fellow misunderstood. It 's best left alone." 

" That 's a fact ! " cried Don. " And so 
is a girl that will give it to you best left 
alone ! But I won't lay the blame on Merry. 
I never got into such a mess. I'm ashamed 
of it, too ; that 's the rub. If I could play 
aggrieved innocent, and that But it 's no 
use. I deserve it, and I'm ashamed of my 
self. I never was before," added Don can 
didly. " I always thought I was a pretty 
nice sort of fellow." 



CHAPTER XL 

RUSTICATED. 

IT was a cold December day in northerly 
Vermont. This is saying a cold thing. 
Donald Marcy was an out-of-doors boy, used 
to weather and able to stand it, but he had 
never known what cold was before. When 
he woke that morning, in the spare room of 
Dr. Fleet 's parsonage, and looked about him, 
and took in the details that presented them 
selves to his shivering senses, he said : 

" The dickens ! " and took a dive under 
the bed-clothes, where he buried his curly 
head and tried to collect his congealing 
courage. He had been at Dr. Fleet 's some 
weeks now, but there had never been any 
thing as cold as this. The frost on his win 
dows lay as thick as blue- white plush ; the 
paper shades stirred and crackled in the 
wind that pierced the loose, old-fashioned 
casements. The straw matting, covered here 
and there by home-made rugs, looked glazed 
to his eyes, like a thin sheet of ice. 



 

His breath froze in the bitter air when 
ever he dared to breathe. His pitcher, which 
he had been in Vermont long enough to learn 
to remove from the wash-stand by the win 
dow (why are wash-stands always set by win 
dows in cold climates ?), stood upon the straw 
matting, in full view, filled to the brim with 
ice. His fire was out. Beside the air-tight 
stove the wood-box stood, half full. He 
filled that wood - box himself ; it was 
expected of him ; Don had never done such a 
thing in his life, before. He was expected 
to build the fire, too ; there was no " sweep " 
at the parsonage ; one little maid-of -all-work 
was the only visible servant. 

It was a great surprise to Don that Mrs. 
Fleet, who was quite a lady, worked hard in 
her own kitchen, harder, he sometimes 
thought, than the very little maid ; and that 
the clergyman himself took care of Old Wil 
liam, the horse, and carried the wood and 
coal. Jamie did these things when he was 
at home. Don felt ashamed the tough 
fellow ! to back out of anything that J. 
could do ; delicate J., with his thin, studious 
face and untrained muscles. So, although 
a boarder in the minister 's family, he had 
adopted the fashions of it without protest. 





Indeed, he had a distant suspicion that the 
system of rustication sometimes involved 
little deviations of this sort from the habits 
of elegant young gentlemen ; and it pleased 
Don 's plucky spirit not to exhibit any as 
tonishment or displeasure. In fact, he had 
accepted Vermont thoroughly ; and the self- 
denials of the parsonage had begun to be 
come a familiar drama in his gay, luxurious, 
young life. 

He had found it rather " slow," it must be 
owned, so far, in the village of East Tipton ; 
the parsonage was by all odds the best part 
of that thin old town, which lay shivering at 
the feet of the awful, snow-clad mountains, 
like a freezing creature overtaken by the 
winter, and trying to warm its poor life at a 
heart of ice. East Tipton was a place in 
which nothing happened. Even Jamie was 
not coming home for the holiday recess. 
Jamie had a chance to tutor his old 
gentleman 's son, at two dollars an hour, through 
vacation ; and a fellow must be better off 
than Jamie to throw away two dollars an 
hour. He had written home a very manly 
letter (he was terribly disappointed, Don 
could see, but he would not show it), simply 
saying that he must stay in Harle, and that 
he was lucky to get the chance. 



 

Fay was coming home, it is true, at the 
holidays ; but Don had never seen Fay ; he 
did not feel an absorbing interest in the fact. 
He fancied her something of a blue-stocking, 
and not at all stylish. Don knew a plenty of 
what are called society girls in New York, 
and, of course, all sorts in Harle ; but the 
Professor 's daughters belonged to another 
class, as much so, in their way, as Merry 
Gorond herself in hers. Don had never 
happened to know any college girls very well ; 
he had notions about them, as gay fellows 
and good dancers are apt to. He thought 
Fay Fleet would probably matronize him, 
and wear spectacles, and a " cloud," like the 
girls in East Tipton whom he met at the 
post-office giggling over the advertising board 
for letters that they never received, and 
nudging each other when the handsome boy 
asked for the minister 's box. 

Still, on the whole, Donald was not sorry 
that the minister 's daughter was coming- 
home that day. It would be some sort of 
change. Don had taken sensibly to the quiet 
life of the parsonage, but there was no de 
nying that it was dull for a lively lad. Dr. 
Fleet put him at once hard at work, that he 
might keep up with his class. This was new 





business for Don ; six hours a day of close 
study, rain or shine, gay or stupid, happy 
or dismal, and not a scrape, not a freak, 
not a frolic, not a fellow to break the pull ! 
Donald had never done any such studying as 
that in all his light, young life. He was 
surprised to find it really interesting at times. 
Dr. Fleet had a " way " with books which 
was to a lazy lad like the Vermont 
mountain wind to a case of swamp malaria. 

For the rest of his days Don will 
remember that old parsonage study, with its shabby 
carpet and well-filled book-shelves, the big 
coal heater, noisy and black and ugly (but 
so much cheaper than the scholar 's luxury of 
an open fire that it was a matter of course), 
the faded shades and patched lounge, and 
the great, hearty rush of sunlight all over 
the rooms on bright days ; the early student- 
lamp with its green shade, when the after 
noons were dark, and the spare figure of 
the minister bent over all sorts of queer, 
rare books in German, French, Old English, 
and who knows what ; his refined face, 
with a strong brow and gentle lips, like 
Jamie s, starting like a medallion from a 
background of dark velvet, and, grown 
unconscious, brilliant and memorable, while he 



 

talked to the careless lad of scholars and of 
scholarly thoughts and deeds and dreams.
