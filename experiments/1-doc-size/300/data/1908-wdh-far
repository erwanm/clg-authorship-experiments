would do was odd, though everything was original. 

" Well, there is such a thing as being too original," 
she returned. Then she turned her head aside and 
looked down at something beside her plate and said, 
without lifting her eyes, " You know that in the Middle 
Ages there used to be flower-fights among the young 

 

nobility in Italy. The women held a tower, and the 
men attacked it with roses and flowers generally." 

" Why, is this a speech ?" Miss Macroyd interrupted. 

" A speech from the throne, yes," Bushwick solemnly 
corrected her. " And she's got it written down, like a 
queen — haven't you, Mrs. Westangle ?" 

" Yes, I thought it would be more respectful." 

" She coming out," Bushwick said to Verrian across 
the table. 

" And if I got mixed up I could go back and straight- 
en it," the hostess declared, with a good - humored 
candor that took the general fancy, " and you could 
understand without so much explaining. We haven't 
got flowers enough at this season," she went on, looking 
down again at the paper beside her plate, " but we hap- 
pen to have plenty of snowballs, and the notion is to 
have the women occupy a snow tower and the men at- 
tack them with snowballs." 

" Why," Bushwick said, " this is the snow-fort busi- 
ness of our boyhood! Let's go out and fortify the 
ladies at once." He appealed to Verrian and made a 
feint of pushing his chair back. " May we use water- 
soaked snowballs, or must they all be soft and harm- 
less?" he asked of Mrs. Westangle, who was now the 
centre of a storm of applause and question from the 
whole table. 

She kept her head and referred again to her paper. 
" The missiles of the assailants are to be very soft 
snowballs, hardly more than mere clots, so that nobody 
can be hurt in the assault, but the defenders may repel 
the assailants with harder snowballs." 

" Oh," Miss Macroyd protested, " this is consulting 
the weakness of our sex." 

" In the fury of the onset we'll forget it," Verrian 
reassured her. 



" Do you think you really will, Mr. Yerrian ?" she 
asked. " What is all our athletic training to go for if 
you do V 

Mrs. Westangle read on : 

" The terms of capitulation can he arranged on the 
ground, whether the castle is carried or the assailing 
party are made prisoners by its defenders." 

" Hopeless captivity in either case !" Bushwick la- 
mented. 

" Isn't it rather academic ?" Miss Macroyd asked of 
Verrian, in a low voice. 

" I'm afraid, rather," he owned. 

" But why are you so serious ?" she pursued. 

" Am I serious ?" he retorted, with a trace of exas- 
peration ; and she laughed. 

Their parley was quite lost in the clamor which raged 
up and down the table till Mrs. Westangle ended it 
by saying, " There's no obligation on any one to take 
part in the hostilities. There won't be any conscrip- 
tion ; it's a free fight that will be open to everybody." 
She folded the paper she had been reading from and 
put it in her lap, in default of a pocket. She went on 
impromptu : 

" You needn't trouble about building the fort, Mr. 
Bushwick. I've had the farmer and his men working 
at the castle since daybreak, and the ladies will find 
it all ready for them, when they're ready to defend 
it, down in the meadow beyond the edge of the birch- 
lot. The battle won't begin till eleven o'clock." 

She rose, and the clamor rose again with her, and her 
guests crushed about her, demanding to be allowed at 
least to go and look at the castle immediately. 

One of the men's voices asked, " May I be one of the 
defenders, Mrs. Westangle ? I want to be on the win- 
ning side, sure." 

 

" Oh, is this going to be a circus chariot-race ?" an- 
other lamented. 

" No, indeed," a girl cried, " it's to be the real thing." 

It fell to Verrian, in the assortment of couples in 
which Mrs. Westangle's guests sallied out to view the 
proposed scene of action, to find himself, not too willing- 
ly, at Miss Macroyd's side. In his heart and in his 
mind he was defending the amusement which he instant- 
ly divined as no invention of Mrs. Westangle's, and 
both his heart and his mind misgave him about this 
first essay of Miss Shirley in her new enterprise. It 
was, as Miss Macroyd had suggested, academic, and 
at the same time it had a danger in it of being tom- 
boyish. Golf, tennis, riding, boating, swimming — all 
the vigorous sports in which women now excel — were 
boldly athletic, and yet you could not feel quite that 
they were tomboyish. Was it because the bent of 
Miss Shirley was so academic that she was perilling 
upon tomboyishness without knowing it in this primal 
inspiration of hers ? Inwardly he resented the word 
academic, although outwardly he had assented to it 
when Miss Macroyd proposed it. To be academic would 
be even more fatal to Miss Shirley's ambition than to 
be tomboyish, and he thought with pathos of that touch 
about the Italian nobility in the Middle Ages, and how 
little it could have moved the tough fancies of that 
crowd of well-groomed young people at the breakfast- 
table when Mrs. Westangle brought it out with her 
ignorant acceptance of it as a social force. After all, 
Miss Macroyd was about the only one who could have 
felt it in the way it was meant, and she had chosen to 
smile at it. He wondered if possibly she could feel the 
secondary pathos of it as he did. But to make talk 
with her he merely asked : 

" Do you intend to take part in the fray ?" 

 

" Not unless I can be one of the reserve corps that 
won't need to be brought up till it's all over. I've no 
idea of getting my hair down." 

" Ah," he sighed, " you think it's going to be 
rude." 

" That is one of the chances. But you seem to be 
suffering about it, Mr. Verrian!" she said, and, of 
course, she laughed. 

" Who ? I ?" he returned, in the temptation to deny 
it. But he resisted. " I always suffer when there's any- 
thing silly happening, as if I were doing it myself. 
Don't you?" 

" No, thank you, I believe not. But perhaps you 
are doing this? One can't suppose Mrs. Westangle 
imagined it." 

" No, I can't plead guilty. But why isn't it predi- 
cable of Mrs. Westangle?" 

" You mustn't ask too much of me, Mr. Verrian. 
Somehow, I won't say how, it's been imagined for her. 
She's heard of its being done somewhere. It can't be 
supposed she's read of it, anywhere." 

" No, I dare say not." 

Miss Macroyd came out with her laugh. " I should 
like to know what she makes of you, Mr. Verrian, when 
she is alone with herself. She must have looked you 
up and authenticated you in her own way, but it would 
be as far from your way as — well, say — the Milky 
Way." 

" You don't think she asked me because she met me 
at your house ?" 

" No, that wouldn't be enough, from her point of 
view. She means to go much further than we've ever 
got." 

" Then a year from now she wouldn't ask me ?" , 

" It depends upon who asks you in the mean time. 

 

You might get to be a fad, and then she would feel 
that she would have to have you." 

" You're not flattering me ?" 

" Do you find it flattering ?" 

" It isn't exactly my idea of the reward I've been 
working for. What shall I do to be a fad ?" 

" Well, rather degrading stunts, if you mean in the 
smart set. Jump about on all fours and pick up a 
woman's umbrella with your teeth, and bark. Anything 
else would be easier for you among chic people, where 
your brilliancy would count." 

"Brilliancy? Oh, thank you! Goon." 

" Now, a girl — if you were a girl — " 

" Oh yes, if I were a girl ! That will be so much 
more interesting." 

" A girl," Miss Macroyd continued, " might do it by 
posing effectively for amateur photography. Or do- 
ing something original in dramatics or pantomimics or 
recitation — but very original, because chic people are 
critical. Or if she had a gift for getting up things 
that would show other girls off; or suggesting amuse- 
ments; but that would be rather in the line of swell 
people, who are not good at getting up things and are 
glad of help." 

" I see, I see !" Verrian said, eagerly. But he walked 
along looking down at the snow, and not meeting the 
laughing glance that Miss Macroyd cast at his face. 
"Well?" 

" I believe that's all," she said, sharply. She added, 
less sharply : " She couldn't afford to fail, though, at 
any point. The fad that fails is extinguished forever. 
Will these simple facts do for fiction? Or is it for 
somebody in real life you're asking, Mr. Verrian ?" 

" Oh, for fiction. And thank you very much. Oh, 
that's rather pretty !" 

 



XIII 

They had come into the meadow where the snow 
battle was to be, and on its slope, against the dark weft 
of the young birch-trees, there was a mimic castle out- 
lined in the masonry of white blocks quarried from the 
drifts and built up in courses like rough blocks of 
marble. A decoration of green from the pines that 
mixed with the birches had been suggested rather than 
executed, and was perhaps the more effective for its 
sketchiness. 

" Yes, it's really beautiful," Miss Macroyd owned, 
and though she did not join her cries to those of the 
other girls, who stood scattered about admiring it, and 
laughing and chattering with the men whose applause, 
of course, took the jocose form, there was no doubt but 
she admired it. " What I can't understand is how Mrs. 
Westangle got the notion of this. There's the soprano 
note in it, and some woman must have given it to her." 

" Not contralto, possibly V Verrian asked. 

" I insist upon the soprano," she said. 

But he did not notice what she said. His eyes were 
following a figure which seemed to be escaping up 
through the birches behind the snow castle and plough- 
ing its way through the drifts ; in front of the structure 
they had been levelled to make an easier battle-field. 
He knew that it was Miss Shirley, and he inferred that 
she had been in the castle directing the farm-hands 
building it, and now, being caught by the premature 
arrival of the contesting forces, had fled before them 



and left her subordinates to finish the work. He felt, 
with a throe of helpless sympathy, that she was under- 
taking too much. It was hazardous enough to attempt 
the practice of her novel profession under the best of 
circumstances, but to keep herself in abeyance so far 
as not to be known at all in it, and, at the same time, 
to give way to her interest in it to the extent of coming 
out, with her infirmly established health, into that 
wintry weather, and superintending the preparations 
for the first folly she had planned, was a risk altogether 
too great for her. 

" Who in the world," Miss Macroyd suddenly de- 
manded, " is the person floundering about in the birch 
woods ?"
