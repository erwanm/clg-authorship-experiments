ing mood, and when I came up from dinner I put on a 
beautiful dress, just for fun, and I looked quite radiant. 
I dreamed of you, and imagined that you were at my 
feet, in true Romeo fashion and I was your Juliet. 
I imagined I couldn't help thinking of this, and I 
knew I ought to be doing something else ! Oh, but how 


I want a poor taste of joy! You were my Romeo to- 
night you were beautiful and young and loving ; and 
well, I had one dream of youth and happiness before 
my miseries begin. 

I have felt that we were very near to each other 
lately. You have shown me the tenderness of your 
heart, and I love you quite rapturously. I love your 
goodness, your sympathy perhaps when I see you I 
can tell vou!

DEAREST THYRSIS : 

I received a postal just now, saying that you were 
coming soon. I had my usual queer faintness. It was 
like receiving word from the dead it seemed such 
centuries aeons since I heard from you! I send you 
this batch of notes I have written you at various times, 
a sort of mental itinerary, for my mind has traveled 
into all sorts of queer places, back and forth. I tell 
you that without your continual influence, I am lost 
in doubt and uncertainty. Please try to understand 
these notes and my fits of love and fear.

DEAR THYRSIS: 

I am in one of my cast-iron moods this morning 
in a fighting mood, I do not care with whom or what. 
You, even you, have not altogether understood me 
you have often given me a dog's portion. I have been 
a slave, a cowering kitten before you, and you (un- 
wittingly I know) have done much to destroy all my 
courage and hope and love by what you call making 
me aware of your higher self. Fortunately I k?ww 



 

what your higher self is, quite as well as you do, if 
not a little better and I know that it is the self that 
most strengthens my love and courage, the self that 
most fills me with life. I have a right to life as well 
as you, and a right to the love in you that most inspires 
me. I feel I am capable of judging this, in spite of 
all my lack of education, and my inability to follow 
you in your intellectual life. 

I have thought lately that you were able to make 
yourself believe that you were anything you wished to 
think yourself. Whenever you wring my heart and de- 
prive me of strength, I shall go somewhere alone, and 
when I have controlled myself, come back to you. 

You say you are master but it must be master of 
the right. I want strength, and why you should think 
it right ever to have helped to throw me into more 
despair, I do not know. The reason I have written all 
this is because such ideas have come to me lately, and 
a fear that sometimes you might resort to your un- 
loving methods, with the thought of its being right. I 
tell you I would rather stay at home, than ever go 
through with some of the pangs you have cost me, in 
what you called your higher moods. You must not 
gainsay me, that I am also capable of respecting high 
moods and bowing before them ; but it would seem to 
me that they are only high if they are a source of in- 
spiration and joy to me. 

Because we love each other, would that be any reason 
why we must dote upon each other, or sink from our 
high resolves? I cannot see why our love for each 
other should not always be a means of our reaching our 
higher selves. You need not answer this letter but 
when you come back, tell me whether what I say im- 
presses you as being right or wrong if there is not 





some justification in it. But perhaps I should wait. 
I have no right to disturb you now.

THYRSIS : 

I woke up this morning with the feeling that I did 
not love you. That same thing has happened to me 
two or three times, and I do not understand it. 

It must be because at the present moment you do not 
love me ! You are writing your book, and telling your- 
self that you cannot love me as you ought! Is this 
so? It is only a surmise on my part, and I do not 
know, but I should not be surprised if you were. I 
only know that the one thing that can bring us to- 
gether is love, and I do not love you now. Perhaps 
you can explain it to me. I write this absolutely with- 
out emotion. 

I tell you there have been things horribly wrong 
about you. You have done anything but inspire love 
in my heart you have never seen me with love in my 
heart. Until lately, I never have felt any love for 
you ; before, I simply compelled myself to think I loved 
you, because my life seemed to depend upon it. There 
have been many times when, as I look back, you seem 
to me to have been base. 

Well may you preach, while you are alone, and are 
monarch of yourself. I shall have to have more of 
a chance than has ever come to me, before I will bear 
your displeasure or your exhortations. If you come 
to me and speak to me of the high, proud self that I 
must reach, every vestige of love for you will leave 
my heart, and I would as soon marry a stone pillar ! 

Great Heaven, what strange moods I have! I picture 



 

our meeting each other, unmoved by love; you de- 
termined, energetic, indifferent to all things, myself 
included ; and I disappointed, but with a hardness in 
my heart no tears ! 

I am indulging now in the most lifeless and gloomy 
of broodings ; if you do not come back to me, the only 
soul I can love, if you are not joyful and strong, sin- 
cere, sympathetic, and loving, all of these I shall know 
it is a farce for me to ever hope to gain any life with 
you. I do not believe that any woman can grow with- 
out love, and a great deal of it. Why do you sup- 
pose I am writing all this I, who have felt such deep 
and true love for you? I have no courage the damp- 
ness of the day has settled into my soul and I shall 
be joyless until there is no more cursed doubt of you 
and your love for me.

DEAR CORYDON : 

Against resolutions, I am writing to you again. I 
thought of you there is a boat up the lake to-day 
with some hunters, and if I finish this letter, I can 
send it in by them as they pass. I have many things 
to tell you, and you must think about them. 

This is one of my paralyzing letters. It will reach 
you Monday. I can't tell where I may be then. I have 
been wrestling with the end of the book, and I am wild 
with rage at my impotence. The fact has come to me 
that no amount of will is enough, because all my life is 
cowardly and false. I have found myself wanting to 
znedk through this work, and come home and enjoy 
myself; and you can't sneak with God, and that's all. 

I cannot come home beaten, and so here I am, still 



 

struggling and with snow on the ground, and the 
shack so cold that I sit half in the fire-place. 

I think of you, and at times when my soul is afire, I 
imagine I can do anything. I see that you are help- 
less, but I think that I can change your whole being, 
and make you what I wish. But then that feeling dies 
out, and I think of you as you are, and with despair. 
I do not allude to any of your "deficiencies" music, 
learning, and other stuff. I mean your life-force, or 
your lack of it. I see that you have learned nothing 
of the unspeakable, unattainable thing for which I am 
panting. And it has come to me that I dare not marry 
you, that I should be binding my life to ruin. My head 
is surging with plans, and a whole infinity of future, 
and I simply cannot carry any woman with me on this 
journey. 

As I say this, I see the tears of despair in your eyes. 
I can only tell you what I am God made me for an 
artist, not a lover! I have not deep feelings I do 
not care for human suffering; I can work, that is all. 
Art is no respecter of persons, and neither am I I 
labor for something which is not of self, and requires 
denial of self. And as I think about you, the feeling 
comes to me that it is not this you want, that I should 
make you utterly wretched if I married you. You love 
love; you do not wish to fling yourself into a struggle 
such as my life must be. I see that in all your letters 
your terror of this highest self of mine. If you 
married me, you would have to fight a battle that 
would almost kill you. You would have to wear your 
heart out, night and day you would have to lose 
yourself and your feelings fling away everything, 
and live in self -contempt and effort. You would have to 
know it I can't help it that I love life, and that to 



THE VICTIM HESITATES 

human hearts I owe no allegiance; that to me they are 
simply impatience and vexation. 

Do you want such a life? If you can learn to love 
it for what it is a wild, unnatural, but royal life- 
very well. If you are coming to me with pleading 
eyes, secretly wishing for affection, and in terror of 
me when you don't get it, then God help you, that is 
all! 

You are a child, and you can not dream what I mean. 
But every day I learn something more of a great savage 
force of mine, that will stand out against the rest of 
this world, that is burning me up, that is driving me 
mad. One of two things it will do to you it will make 
you the same kind of creature, or it will tear the soul 
out of you. Do you understand that? And nothing 
will stop it it cares for nothing in the world but the 
utterance of itself ! And if you wish to marry me, it will 
be with no promise of mine save to wreak it upon you ! 
To take you, and make you just *uch a creature, kill 
or cure nothing else ! Not one instant's patience 
but just one insistent, frantic demand that you suc- 
ceed and fiery, writhing disgust with you when you 
do not succeed disgust that will make you scream 
and make you live! Do you understand this and do 
you get any idea of the temper behind this? And how 
it seems to you, I don't know it is the only kind of 
truth I am capable of; I shall simply fling naked the 
force of my passionate, raging will, and punish you 
with it each instant of your life until you understand 
it, and love it, and worship it, as I do. 

Now, I don't know what you will think about this 
letter and I don't care. It is here and you must 
take it. It does not come to you for criticism, any 
more than it would come for criticism to the world. It 



 

will rule the world. If I marry you I must live all my 
soul before you, and you must share it ; if you think 
you can do this without first having suffered, having 
first torn loose your own crushed self, you are mistaken. 
But remember this I shall demand from you just as 
much fire as I give ; you may say you cannot, you may 
weep and say you cannot I will gnash my teeth at 
you and say you must. 

Perhaps I'm a fool to think I can do this. At any 
rate, I don't want to do anything else ; I am a fool to 
think of doing anything else, and you to let me. 

I cannot be false to my art without having a reac- 
tion of disgust, and you cannot marry me, unless you 
understand that. When I sat down to this letter I 
called myself mad for trying to tie my life to yours. 
Now I am interested in you again. You may wish to 
make this cast still ; and oh, of course I shall drop 
back as usual, and you'll be happy, and I'll be your 
"Romeo" ! 

Ugh how I hated that letter ! "Romeo" indeed ! 
Wouldn't we have a fine sentimental time you with 
your prettiest dress on, and I holding you in my arms 
and telling you how much I loved you !
