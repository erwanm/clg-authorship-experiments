"There are so many things to do," said Miss 
Elsie, "and it seems as if you came to the country 



 

in the summer to rest a little, to swing in ham- 
mocks and ready and not dissipate all the time. 
I'm fond of talking over books and pictures and 
getting other people's ideas, and I paint a little 
and practice my music and embroider. Which 
is the musician here, or are you both?" 

Helen disclaimed any great proficiency. Miss 
Travis went over to Juliet, and they soon found 
they had similar tastes. She was charming, too, 
to Mrs. Wilmarth, and invited them all up to 
afternoon tea, which they often had on the large 
piazza. They were fond of living out-of-doors. 

"I am delighted," Mrs. Wilmarth said after 
they were gone. "I was afraid we might find 
ourselves a little lonesome." 

"If I felt any such malady threatening me I 
should go and have a chat or a race with old 
Neptune," laughed Helen. 

Indeed, the fortnight Mr. Wilmarth spent they 
were really very gay. One picnic over on the 
beach, and several sails and drives seemed to fill 
up every available moment. Mrs. Wilmarth soon 
became accustomed to the bathing, and Helen 
reveled in it, but Juliet could not be persuaded to 
venture. The Travis girls were quite expert 
swimmers, and the younger boys were very 
daring. 





One of the guests at Mrs. Ballinger's proved 
extremely interesting. She was slowly recover- 
ing from a severe accident, and was a young 
widow with moderate means. Indeed, Helen 
found herself relieved from much of the devotion 
she had set for herself. Mrs. Gilbert was fond 
of reading aloud, and she had moved in rather 
intellectual society. She took a great fancy to 
Juliet Craven, and thus for once Helen did not 
come first, and in her generous heart was de- 
lighted. 

Mrs. Wilmarth improved every day. It was 
quite like the olden times of health. 

There were many things to amuse as welL 
Helen found some people queerer than those at 
Hope. They seemed to have the flavor of the 
salt air which was different from inland towns. 
Their weather-beaten look left them sharp and 
shrewd, and full of subtle speeches that you had 
to think a moment or two about to discern the 
real meaning. There was something in the laugh 
as well, a sort of inner astuteness that sometimes 
puzzled her. Country people were not all alike. 
Environment stood for a good deal after all. She 
felt that her experiences were broadening. 

Chie day at the post office she found among her 
letters one from Daisy Bell. Why had she almost 



 

forgotten her in this rush of new experiences ? It 
had gone to Hope and been re-mailed. It was a 
full month since they had parted. She could 
not have written for she did not know Daisy's 
address. Yet, with her earnest nature she felt 
ar little conscience-smitten that she had not 
thought more about her. 

Daisy was having a splendid time. They had 
gone to Portland, then up among the islands, and 
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec, and Mon- 
treal and the splendid Falls, where they would 
spend a week or more. Mr. Lawrence Hollis 
had joined them, and now he was really Marjo- 
rie's accepted lover. Annis and her husband were 
coming. Then they would go on to Detroit and 
Chicago. Traveling about was the most fascinat- 
ing thing in the world. You met so many charm- 
ing people. "I've made up my mind that I shall 
marry a very rich man who loves to travel. Ill 
go to Europe on my wedding tour and stay two 
years. Then there is that wonderful California 
and Japan, and I just feel as if I could keep 
going all my life. I envy the money that dull, 
queer Craven girl has, and she didn't want to go 
to Europe! She'd be just as well content with 
half of it. If I were you I'd strike her for some 
nice journeys. What will she ever do with all 





the money unless some man marries her for it? 
And where is the sense of her going to college !" 
gossiped Daisy. 

"What are you doing? Did you go off with 
that invalid friend to some poky place where there 
are no young men? I've had some gay times 
and been a good deal admired, but mamma is 
quite a duenna. Still, there are odds and ends 
you can pick up. Of course Margie's rather 
serious as befits a prospective clergyman's wife, 
so I can't go to her with my bits of fun. When 
we get home I shall want you to come at once. 
I had a touch of sentiment about going to college, 
I was such a pet with two girls who graduated 
with that high purpose in view, but I'm so glad 
I do not care about it. I think men, the nice 
young men, wouldn't raise up their little finger 
for much learning in a woman, and they have an 
idea that most college girls are or will be old 
maids. Of course you want to graduate some- 
where and have a diploma. 

"There, I can't write another word, but I want 
a good long letter from you. Now that I really 
have renewed my hold on you I shall not let you 
go, and mamma thinks there is no girl quite like 
you for a nice, steady friend. Oh, I must tell 
you about Willard. A dear friend of papa's 



 

oifered him a position in his law office, but he 
had to go at once as they needed some help while 
the other two partners were away — one in Eu- 
rope. It was very fine and complimentary, I 
believe, and papa quite insisted on his taking it, 
so the poor boy won't have any vacation until 
September. Good-bye, with oceans of love, 

"Daisy." 

Helen felt disappointed with the flippancy. 
And yet Daisy had a sweet and charming side to 
her nature. 

The letter was easily answered. The Travis 
girls had introduced them to some nice acquaint- 
ances, and they had met others at the chapel. 
The clergyman was attractive and had a charm- 
ing young wife who was a college graduate and 
who exhorted all girls who had any desire to 
go for the excellent training. It gave life a much 
wider outlook. 

Then there had been one tremendous storm 
when it seemed as if the house would be blown 
farther inland or toppled over. They didn't 
wonder that trees grew awry. The rain was 
like a deluge. A night and a day, then another 
night and a dull gray morning with a cold wind. 
No bathing, and Mrs. Ballinger's "boy" brought 
up the mail. 





Katy had cleared the asparagus branches and 
the fern leaves out of the dining room fire-place 
and built a splendid log fire that diffused a de- 
lightful warmth around. Mrs. Ballinger had run 
over to see if they were all safe. There had been 
a few leakages in the roof, and part of the gar- 
den fence had blown down. Helen had read 
and sung and talked and now the room was get- 
ting too strait for the energetic girl. 

"I think Fll wrap up and take a little walk," 
she announced. "The fire has baked me red and 
brown, so I must try a turn out-of-doors to re- 
store the equilibrium. Juliet?" inquiringly. 

"I do not think I can be tempted. And you 
are crazy! The storm hasn't ended." 

"There is a light streak in the west." 

"But the wind is east." 

"Oh Helen, don't go out. So near night, too," 
pleaded Mrs. Wilmarth. 

"Just for a little run down to the bay, and a 
look at the wrecked bathing house. You will 
see how fresh I shall return. Think of staying 
in the house two whole days !" 

She put on her rain cloak and drew the hood 
over her head, looking like a bright eyed gipsy 
as the red lining framed her in. 

"Fm afraid to have you go. Do not let the 



 

turbulent ocean draw you in and devour you and 
add to the rest of the wreckage." 

Helen laughed and gave them each a kiss. 

The two, both reticent by nature and made 
more so by circumstances, had reached a point 
of confidence and fell now and then into bits of 
early experiences. Mrs. Wilmarth's had been 
bright enough until the break in health came, but 
she seemed to understand Juliet's life readily. 
She, too, had longed for the solace of children 
that never came, and now realized that the need 
must- be satisfied with companionship. Helen 
was all exhilaration to her, Juliet had a quiet 
charm as well as a need, and Mrs. Wilmarth had 
unconsciously learned Helen's lovely lesson of 
giving from her inmost heart And Juliet, in 
some respects made older than her years, enjoyed 
the womanhood and the experience. There were 
many sides to one's nature she was finding. 

Helen drew a long breath though the air was 
dull and heavy. The light streak in the west was 
dying out, and the cloudiness seemed to drop 
lower down, enveloping everything. The roar of 
the ocean was driven fiercely inland as if it were 
the cry of some mighty tragedy not yet finished, 
but was to go on until ended by that divine fiat, 
— "There shall be no more sea." 




The great waves came on with their frothy, snowy-white 
crowns.



She turned up beside the bay. The sand had 
been tramped hard by the rain. The great waves 
with the wind back of them came on with their 
frothy, snowy-white crowns, losing a little of their 
force as they struck the sandy bar now submerged 
but still there, when it seemed as if it must be 
entirely swept away. What foundation did it 
rest upon — a bed of rocks? She was strongly 
moved by the mighty swells of sound running 
through octaves of mystery, bringing vague airs 
and refrains such as man could never transcribe. 

Helen was so moved by the grandeur and 
strength that was incomprehensible to the finite 
understanding, that she tramped on in an up- 
lifted frame of mind touched by the mighty 
power that of old had moved upon the face of the 
waters. There suddenly dropped down a vague- 
ness, a sense of darkness, and she remembered it 
was getting late, so she turned. The wind had 
veered a little and was driving up a dense fog 
from the southeast. It looked like a mysterious 
army marching on to capture her. She must 
meet it of course. It was not armed with staves 
and spears, so she would not have to fight. She 
was fleet of foot and began to run, keeping up on 
the hard sand. It was a straight path, but after 
a few moments she could not see even the houses. 



 

What if she should pass the street and go on too 
far? This must surely be it, and she turned 
quickly, coming with a sudden impact against 
another person, and would have fallen if the out- 
stretched arms had not caught her. 
*"Oh," she cried. "This is my street, or lane
