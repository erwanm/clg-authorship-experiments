drive this home, in his neat, brisk way, " Some 
action has to be taken." 

" You mean a declaration made ? " 

" Under penalty," the Doctor assented, " of 
consequences sufficiently tremendous. There has 
been an accident of a gravity " 

Dennis took him up. " That can't be kept 
quiet?" 

The Doctor looked at his watch; then, still 
holding it, he quickly looked up. " You want to 
keep it so ? " 

Vidal's haggard face turned red, but he in 
stantly recovered himself. " Why do you ask, if 
you've a duty ? " 

" I haven't one worse luck. I've fifty." 





Dennis fixed his eyes on the watch. "Does 
that mean you can keep the thing in hand?" 

The Doctor put his talisman away. " Before I 
say, I must know what you'll do for me." 

Dennis stared at the lamp. " Hasn't it gone too 
far?" 

"I know how far. Not so far, by a peculiar 
mercy, as it might have gone. There has been an 
extraordinary coincidence of chances a miracle 
of conditions. Everything appears to serve." He 
hesitated ; then with great gravity : " We'll call it 
a providence and have done with it." 

Dennis turned this over. "Do you allude to 
the absence of witnesses ?" 

" At the moment the child was found. Only the 
blessed three of us. And she had been there " 
Stupefaction left him counting. 

Dennis jerked out a sick protest. " Don't tell 

me how long! What do Iwant ?" What 

he wanted proved, the next moment, to be more 
knowledge. "How do you meet the servants?" 

"Here? By giving a big name to her com 
plaint. None of them have really seen her. She 
was carried in with a success ! " The Doc 
tor threw up triumphant little hands. 

"But the people at the other house?" 



 

" They know nothing but that over here she 
has had an attack which it will be one of the fifty 
duties of mine I mentioned to you to make suffi 
ciently remarkable. She was out of sorts this 
morning ; this afternoon I was summoned. That 
call of Tony's is the providence ! " Dr. Eamage 
declared. 

But still Dennis pressed him. " Hadn't she 
some fond old nurse some devoted dragon ? " 

" The great Gorham ? Yes : she didn't want 
her to come ; she was cruelly overborne. Well," 
the Doctor lucidly pursued, " I must face the 
great Gorham. I'm already keeping her at bay 
doctors are so luckily despots ! She'll be tough 
-but it's all tough!" 

Dennis, pressing his hand to his head, began 
wearily to pace again : it was far too tough for 
him. But he suddenly, dropped upon the sofa, all 
but audibly moaning, falling back in the despair 
that broke through his false pluck. Doctor 
Ramage watched his pain as if he had something 
to hope from it; then, abruptly, the young man 

began : " I don't in the least conceive how " 

He stopped short : even this he couldn't bring out. 

" How was it done ? Small blame to you ! It 
was done in one minute with the aid of a boat 





and the temptation (we'll call it!) of solitude. 
The boat's an old one of Tony's own padlocked, 
but with a long chain. To see the place," said 
the Doctor after an instant, " is to see the deed." 

Dennis threw back his head ; he covered his dis 
torted face with his two hands. " Why in thun 
der should I see it? " 

The Doctor had moved towards him ; at this he 
seated himself beside him and, going on with 
quiet clearness, applied a controlling, soothing 
grasp to his knee. " The child was taken into 
the boat and it was tilted : that was enough 
the trick was played." Dennis remained motion 
less and dumb, and his companion completed the 
picture. " She was immersed she was held un 
der water she was made sure of. Oh, I grant 
you it took a hand and it took a spirit! But 
they were there. Then she was left. A pull of 
the chain brought back the boat ; and the author 
of the crime walked away." 

Dennis slowly shifted his position, dropped his 
head, dropped his hands, sat staring lividly at the 
floor. " But how could she be caught ? " 

The Doctor hesitated, as if in the presence of 
an ambiguity. " The poor little girl ? You'd see 
if you saw the place." 



 

" I passed it to come back here," Dennis said. 
" But I didn't look, for I didn't know." 

The Doctor patted his knee. " If you had 
known you would have looked still less. She 
rose ; she drifted some yards ; then she washed 
against the base of the bridge, and one of the 
openings of her little dress hooked itself to an old 
loose clamp. There she was kept." 

" And no one came by ? " 

"No one came till, by the mercy of God, I 
came ! " 

Dennis took it in as if with a long, dry gulp, 
and the two men sat for a minute looking at each 
other. At last the younger one got up. "And 
yet the risk of anything but a straight course is 
hideous." 

The Doctor kept his place. "Everything's 
hideous. I appreciate greatly," he added, "the 
gallantry of your reminding me of my danger. 
Don't think I don't know exactly what it is. But 
I have to think of the danger of others. I can 
measure mine; I can't measure theirs." 

" I can return your compliment," Dennis replied. 
" ' Theirs,' as you call it, seems to me such a fine 
thing for you to care for." 

The Doctor, with his plump hands folded on his 










stomach, gave a small stony smile. " My dear 
man, I care for my friends ! " 

Dennis stood before him ; he was visibly mysti 
fied. " There's a person whom it's very good of 
you to take this occasion of calling by that 
name ! " 

Doctor Ramage stared; with his vision of his 
interlocutor's mistake all his tight curves grew 
tense. Then, as he sprang to his feet, he seemed 
to crack in a grim little laugh. " The person you 
have in mind is, I confess, not, my dear sir " 

" One of the persons," said Dennis, " whom you 
wish to protect? It certainly would have sur 
prised me to hear it! But you spoke of your 
' friends.' Who then is your second one ? " 

The Doctor looked astonished at the question. 
"Why, sweet Jean Martle." 

Dennis equally wondered. " I should have sup 
posed her the first ! Who then is the other ? " 

The Doctor lifted his shoulders. " Who but 
poor Tony Bream?" 

Dennis thought a moment. "What's Ms dan- 
ger?" 

The Doctor grew more amazed. " The danger 
we've been talking of ! " 

" Have we been talking of that ? " 



 

"You ask me, when you told me you knew 



Dennis, hesitating, recalled. " Knew that he's 
accused ?" 

His companion fairly sprang at him. " Accused 
by her, too ? " 

Dennis fell back at his onset. " Is he by any 
body else ? " 

The Doctor, turning crimson, had grabbed his 
arm ; he blazed up at him. " You don't know it 
all ? " 

Dennis faltered. "Is there any more?" 

" Tony cries on the housetops that he did it ! " 

Dennis sank once more on his sofa. "He 
cries ?" 

" To cover Jean." 

Dennis took it in. "But if she is covered?" 

" Then to shield Miss Armiger." 

Poor Dennis gazed aghast. "Who meanwhile 
charges him ? " He was on his feet again ; again 
he moved to the open window and stood there 
while the Doctor, in silence, waited. Presently 
he turned round. "May I see him?" 

The Doctor, as if he had expected this, was 
already at the door. " God bless you ! " And he 
flashed out. 





Dennis, left alone, stood rigid in the middle of 
the room, plunged apparently in a stupor of emo 
tion ; then, as if shaken out of it by a return of 
conscious suffering, he passed in a couple of strides 
to the door of the library. Here, however, with 
his hand on the knob, another impulse stayed him 
kept him irresolute, listening, drawing his breath 
in pain. Suddenly he turned away Tony Bream 
had come in. 



XXXI 

" IF in this miserable hour I've asked you for a 
moment of your time," Dennis immediately said, 
" I beg you to believe it's only to let you know 

that anything in the world I can do for you " 

Tony raised a hand that mutely discouraged as 
well as thanked him, but he completely delivered 
himself : " I'm ready, whatever it is, to do on the 
spot." 

With his handsome face smitten, his red eyes 
contracted, his thick hair disordered, and his black 
garments awry, Tony had the handled, hustled 
look of a man just dragged through some riot or 
some rescue and only released to take breath. 
Like Rose, for Vidal, he was deeply disfigured, 
but with a change more passive and tragic. His 
bloodshot eyes fixed his interlocutor's. "I'm 
afraid there's nothing anyone can do for me.
