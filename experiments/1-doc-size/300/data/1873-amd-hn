Madge laughed at this stroke of policy. 

" And if everything else fails, I can go out into the high 
ways and hedges and compel them to come in." 

" She will hardly be able to walk that far," said Jessie, 
thoughtfully. "So, if you would like the carriage " 

" If you think we should not frighten Mrs. Bristow with 
our grand state ; " and Miss Hetty shook her silvery curia 
with a questioning nod. 

They went that very afternoon Miss Hetty was sc 
impatient to begin. The younger Mrs,. Bristow seemed a 
good deal flattered by the call, and entertained her visitois 
with an almost fulsome civility. The poor old lady, in her 
soiled cap and ragged gown, was a rather pitiable object. 
Past seventy, and almost blind, she had come to be con- 
sidered a great encumbrance. 

Miss Hetty gave her invitation in the mildest manner 
possible, fearful of some under-current of objection. 

"To be sure she'll go, and the change 'll do her 
good," said Mrs. Bristow, eagerly. " I should think you 
would be lonesome in that place where your sister died, 
and not a livin' soul to speak to ! Granny, you run up 
stairs and get ready right away. Here, Sarah Jane, you 
go and help her. She mopes about dreadfully, bein' so 
near blind. If I haven't had a hard row, then no woman 
ever had ; and Tom drunk half the time ! " 

It was Mrs. Bristow's habit to detail her troubles to 
every one who came in. The children, and Tom, and 
Granny were her prolific subjects, and the two guests were 
rather glad when they were able to bring the call to an end. 

After her mother-in-law had been helped into the car- 
riage, Mrs. Bristow came with a great bundle. 

" I thought I'd bring her a change of clothes," she 
said. " Old people are queer about such things. And now 
Granny, don't you go to getting homesick ! " 

Miss Hetty smiled again as they drove away. 

"A gladder creature you never saw," she said, a few



 

days after, to Mrs. Ashburton. " Why, when I told her all 
the plan, she cried like a baby, and kissed my hand over 
and over again. She is so happy and thankful, that it is a 
real pleasure ! And I guess her daughter-in-law hoped 
she would stay, for she sent every old rag belonging to 
her, and half of them are not fit to put on. But if I 
only had poor Jenny Yates ! " 

Mrs. Brown gave the hospital project a good airing. 

Miss Hetty could hardly have had a better prospectus. 
AM. Riverside knew before long that Miss Hetty Bright 
meant to open her house to the lame, and the halt, and the 
blind, and sow her small fortune broadcast. 

Mr. Maurice and Mr. Wy verne gave it a hearty indorse- 
ment. In the course of a month, Miss Hetty found that 
the highways and byways were quite ready to accept her 
invitation, and that the house enlargement would be 
needed. So they were all busy enough planning, and 
Madge took a warm interest in the work. 

One afternoon Mr. Wy verne walked up to Home Nook 
with Eleanor, whom he had met on the cars. They found 
Madge on the lawn, entertaining baby Greta with a mar- 
vellous picture-book. 

Something of the old brightness had returned. All the 
gay girlishness would never be there again, not even with 
the most perfect health ; for after we have once sipped the 
chalice of a profound and costly experience to the very 
dregs, there may be summer ripeness, with a soul deeper, 
stronger, and richer, but hardly the abundant bloom of the 
earlier spring. 

"Do you remember your design for a stained-glass 
window?" Mr. Wyverne asked presently. 

" Yes. You have it, I believe." 

"Would you object to part with it?" 

" No ; " and she glanced wonderingly at him. 

"I showed it to a friend of mine, who thought it very 





" O ! " and Madge flushed with pleasure. 

" He has offered two hundred dollars for it. It is worth 
more, he admits, but he cannot afford to make any better 
proposal, and would really like to have it. It might be a 
good thing for you if you cared to try the work." 

" Two hundred dollars ! Why it is splendid ; is it not, 
Nelly ? O, Mr. Wyverne ! how can I ever thank you ? " 

She brushed back the bright hair in her eagerness, still 
incredulous. 

" Will you empower me, then, to conclude the bargain?" 

" I shall be more than obliged to you for the trouble." 

" It will be a pleasure to me " 

The scarlet lip quivered a little. With a great tremble 
in her voice, she said, 

" Are you quite sure that it is really mine ? For I can- 
not believe " 

"That you have blossomed into a genius? My friend 
thinks that you should cultivate your talent to the utmost." 

Madge ran off to her mother with the joyful news. By 
degrees she had drifted back to the old place in that dear 
heart, to the tender twilight confidences that cleared up so 
many difficulties. She was learning that no one could 
spring at once to the top of the Rock that is so much 
higher than ourselves. In her blindness, she had missed 
for a while the sure steps provided by a wiser hand, and 
going back, sought them with careful patience. A cheer- 
ful, steady endurance first, instead of the dull resistance 
that she had once called resignation; and then, waiting 
God's appointed time, leaning on Him when the waves rose 
high. She began to understand the grand secret of 
Jessie's life. 

They were all wonderfully pleased with her good for 
tune. Philip and Mr. Graham congratulated her. 

"I believe I was meant for some kind of a business 
woman," she said, laughingly. " And though this may not 
be very profitable, it will afford me a new interest." 



 

"Was life so devoid of it?" asked her mother, with a 
half sad, half sweet smile. 

" O, no, mamma ; don't think that. There al frays was a 
restless spirit within me, and it will take years to bring me 
to any kind of harmonious development. Why do you 
look so grave ? " 

" My darling, I do not want you to make a rebound to 
the other extreme. Home must always be a woman's 
most sacred sphere, and instead of making it conform to 
other duties, she should make other duties subservient to 
it, unless there is an urgent necessity for her to enter the 
world's arena." 

"O, mamma! I do not believe there is any danger of 
my becoming a noisy reformer, though I do not think I 
have Jessie's or Nelly's special gift for the small, sweet 
graces of the fireside. But they may come by cultivation. 
You know how I once rebelled against teaching school ; 
but I find now that, in return, it taught me some of my 
grandest lessons. I seem to understand Greta the better 
for having studied other children, and my impulses are not 
so impatient. And I begin to see what the apostle meant 
when he said, 'Tribulation worketh patience, and patience 
experience, and experience hope.' " 

" And I pray the last may bear fruit abundantly with 
you, my dear child," the mother said, kissing the sweet 
young face. 

It was a happy summer. Without demanding anything 
the Ashburtons had been reinstated in their old position. 
Their refinement and culture had in it the ring of true 
gold, and Riverside soon found them one of its chief at- 
tractions. 

Miss Hetty's new house progressed rapidly. Madge and 
Jessie had planned the interior. On the ground floor there 
were three rooms, and above, the same number, with the 
addition of a bath-room. Plain, neat, and convenient, 
quite distinct from the other part, if one chose to shut it 





off. Already Miss Hetty had three inmates, and had found 
it necessary to call in the services of a good strong 
woman. Mrs. Brown had changed her opinion somewhat, 
aided considerably by Mr. Maurice. 

"And I do believe now that she would be willing to 
have me go," said poor Jenny, tremulously. " O, if I only 
could ! " 

"The poor child!" ejaculated Miss Hetty. "She eha), 
come and have a little rest and peace. If you could onlj? 
manage it, Miss Jessie!" 

Jessie did " manage " it very nicely. Mrs. Brown con- 
sidered it a great favor to accede, and confessed that she 
never had any wonderful opinion of such places, as the heads 
of them usually wanted a great deal of glorifying, and she 
nor hers ever had come to charity yet. 

"But if you chose, you might do many things for 
Jenny, there, sending her clothes and food." 

" No, indeed. If she goes, I shall wash my hands of 
the matter," was the tart reply. " If Miss Hetty wants her 
so much, let her take care of her, then." 

So Jenny Yates was removed to pure air, quiet, and 
Cleanliness. For nearly five years she had been disabled, 
first with inflammatory rheumatism, and then partial 
paralysis. Now she was quite helpless, sometimes not 
even having the use of her hands. 

" That crowds me pretty well," said Miss Hetty, " but 
we shall soon be in the new part. But I am glad to take 
her in, for she seems to me like one of the Saviour's ' little 
ones.' And now, my dear, I have something else to tell 
you, which is very odd. Read this letter." 

It was an early summer evening, and they were sitting 
on the wide porch at Home Nook. Miss Hetty drew the 
epistle from her capacious pocket, in which she managed 
to stow away a little of everything, and handed it to 
Jessie. 

The writing was in a delicate, lady-like hand, and the 



 

person told her story very simply ; a widow, past forty, 
with no children or near relatives, and but a era all incom?, 
an incurable invalid. "I listened oue day to a description 
of yourself and the work you were proposing to do," she 
wrote, "and the idea has haunted my mind until it has 
given me courage to speak. I am not a proper subject for 
a hospital, because there is no remedy for my lingering 
diseases nothing but waiting God's time patiently. But 
my income is not large enough to board and keep a nurse, 
and I have often thought that if I could find some home 
for helpless invalids, where T could have care in common 
with others, I might be able to ofier partial remuneration. 
If such an arrangement could be made that, by paying five 
dollars a week, I could secure a quiet home and a little 
religious society, I should be most grateful. In the summer, 
I am able to walk out short distances but in the winter I am 
confined to my room, much of the time to my bed. Think 
over my case, and if it is possible to ofier me any refuge, 
may G-od kindly dispose your heart towards such a work 
of charity." 

" She is a lady, evidently," said Jessie, " and a patient 
Christian woman. But where could she have heard ? " - 

" You know I meant to take in only poor people," was 
Miss Hetty's rather hesitating rejoinder. "A kind of Old 
Ladies' Home, but for the sick as well." 

" Will you allow me to express an opinion ? " asked Mr. 
Graham, with a smile. 

" O, certainly." 

"Mr. Maurice, Mr. Wyverne, and I have been discuss* 
rag your project with the judgment and wider experience 
of men. At present, it is your charity, supported by your 
money ; but we think you are laying the foundation of a 
work too noble to be allowed to perish with your life ; yet: 
in order to outlast you, it must have a permanent organiza- 
tion, and some source of income. I will tell you now that 
Jessie and I mean to endow one room that is, set aside,
