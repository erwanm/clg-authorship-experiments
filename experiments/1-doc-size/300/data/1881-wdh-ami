get settled at North Conway." 

He gave his dry chuckle to see her so fired with 
pleasure, and he enjoyed the ardor with which she 
drove him up out of his chair, and dashed off her let 
ters. This was her old way ; he would have liked 
the prospect of the Hallecks coming, because it made 
his girl so happy, if for nothing else. 

"Father, I will tell you about Ben Halleck," she 
said, pounding her letter to Olive with the thick of 
her hand to make the envelope stick. " You know 
that lameness of his ? " 

"Yes." 

" Well, it came from his being thrown down by 
another boy when he was at school. He knew the 
boy that did it ; and the boy must have known that 
Mr. Halleck knew it, but he never said a word to 
show that he was sorry, or did anything to make up 
for it. He 's a man now, and lives there in Boston, 
and Ben Halleck often meets him. He says that if 



 

the man can stand it he can. Don 't you think that 's 
grand ? When I heard that, I made up my mind 
that I wanted Elavia to belong to Ben Halleck 's 
church, or the church he did belong to ; he doesn 't 
belong to any now ! " 

" He couldn 't have got any damages for such a 
thing anyway," the Squire said. 

Marcia paid no heed to this legal opinion of the 
case. She .took off her father 's hat to put the letters 
into it, and, replacing it on his head, " Now don 't you 
forget them, father," she cried. 

She gathered up her baby and hurried into the 
house, where she began her preparations for her 
guests. 

The elder Miss Hallecks had announced with much 
love, through Olive, that they should not be able to 
come to Equity, and Ben was to bring Olive alone. 
Marcia decided that Ben should have the guest-cham 
ber, and Olive should have her room ; she and Bart- 
ley could take the little room in the L while their 
guests remained. 

But when the Hallecks came, it appeared that Ben 
had engaged quarters for himself at the hotel, and no 
expostulation would prevail with him to come to 
Squire Gaylord 's house. 

" We have to humor him in such things, Mrs. Hub- 
bard," Olive explained, to Marcia 's distress. "And 
most people get on very well without him." 

This explanation was of course given in Halleck 's 
presence. His sister added, behind his back : " Ben 
lias a perfectly morbid dread of giving trouble in a 
house. He won 't let us do anything to make him 
comfortable at home, and the idea that you should 
attempt it drove him distracted. You must nt mind 
it. I don 't believe he d have come if his bachelor 
freedom could ri t have been respected ; and we both 
wanted to come very much." 



 

The Hallecks arrived in the forenoon, and Baitley 
was due in the evening. But during the afteinoon 
Marcia had a telegram saying that he could not come 
till two days later, and asking her to postpone the 
picnic she had planned. The Hallecks were only 
going to stay three days, and the suspicion that 
Hartley had delayed in order to leave himself as little 
time as possible with them rankled in her heart so 
that she could not keep it to herself when they met. 

" Was that what made you give me such a cool 
reception ? " he asked, with cynical good-nature. 
" Well, you 're mistaken ; I don 't suppose I mind the 
Hallecks any more than they do me. I ll, tell you 
why I stayed. Some people dropped down on With- 
erby, who were a little out of his line. fashionable 
people that he had asked to let him know if they 
ever came to Boston ; and when they did come and 
let him know, he didn 't know what to do about it, 
and he called on me to help him out. I 've been 
almost boarding with Witherby for the last three 
days ; and I 've been barouching round all over the 
moral vineyard with his friends : out to Mount Au 
burn and the Washington Elm, and Bunker Hill, and 
Brookline, and the Art Museum, and Lexington ; 
we Ve been down the harbor, and we haven 't left a 
monumental stone unturned. They were going north, 
and they came down here with me ; and I got them 
to stop over a day for the picnic." 

" You got them to stop over for the picnic ? Why, 
I don 't want anybody but ourselves, Bartley ! This 
spoils everything." 

"The Hallecks are not ourselves," said Bartley. 
" And these are jolly people ; they 'll  help to make it 
go off." 

" Who are they ? " asked Marcia, with provisional 
self-control. 

." Oh, some people that Witherby met in Portland 



 

at Willett s, who used to have the lodging-camp out 
here." 

" That Montreal woman ! " cried Marcia, with fatal 
divination. N 

Bartley laughed. " Yes, Mrs. Macallister and her 
liusband. She 's a regular case. She 'll  amuse you." 

Marcia 's passionate eyes blazed. " She shall never 
come to my picnic in the world ! " 

" No ? " Bartley looked at her in a certain way. 
" She shall come to mine, then. There will be two 
picnics. The more the merrier." 

Marcia gasped, as if she felt the clutch in which 
her liusband had her tightening on her heart. She 
said that she could only carry her point against him 
at the cost of disgraceful division before the Hallecks, 
for which he would not care in the least. She moved 
her head a little from side to side, like one that 
breathes a stifling air. " Oh, let her come," she said 
quietly, at last. 

" Now you 're talking business," said Bartley. " I 
haven 't forgotten the little snub Mrs. Macallister 
gave me, and you 'll  see me pay her off." 

Marcia made no answer, but went downstairs to 
put what face she could upon the matter to Olive, 
whom she had left alone in the parlor, while she ran 
up with Bartley immediately upon his arrival to de 
mand an explanation of him. In her wrathful haste 
she had forgotten to kiss him, and she now remem 
bered that he had not looked at the baby, which she 
had all the time had in her arms. 

The picnic was tp be in a pretty glen three or 
four miles north of the village, where there was shade 
on a bit of level green, and a spring bubbling out of 
a fern-hung bluff: from which you looked down the 
glen over a stretch of the river. Marcia had planned 
that they were to drive thither in a four-seated carry 
all, but the addition of Bartley 's guests disarranged 
this. 



 

" There 's only one way," said Mrs. Macallister, who 

had driven up with her husband from the hotel to 
the Squire 's house in a buggy. " Mr. Halleck tells 
me he doesn 't know how to drive, and my husband 
doesn 't know the way. Mr. Hubbard must get in 
here with me, and you must take Mr. Macallister 
in your party." She looked authoritatively at the 
others. 

" First rate ! " cried Bartley, climbing to the seat 
which Mr. Macallister left vacant. " We 'll  lead the 
way." 

Those who followed had difficulty in keeping their 
buggy in sight. Sometimes Bartley stopped long 
enough for them to come up, and then, after a word 
or two of gay banter, was oft again. 

They had taken possession of the picnic grounds, 
and Mrs. Macallister was disposing shawls for rugs 
and drapery, while Bartley, who had got the horse out, 
and tethered where he could graze, was pushing the 
buggy out of the way by the shafts, when the carryall 
came up. 

" Don 't we look quite domestic ? " she asked of the 
arriving company, in her neat English tone, and her 
rising English inflection. "You know I like this," 
she added, singling Halleck out for her remark, and 
making it as if it were brilliant. " I like being out 
of doors, don 't you know. But there 's one thing I 
don 't like : we weren 't able to get a drop of cham 
pagne at that ridiculous hotel. They told us they 
were not allowed to keep intoxicating liquors.
Now I call that jolly stupid, you know. I don 't 
know whatever we shall do if you haven 't brought 
something." 

" I believe this is a famous spring," said Halleck. 

" How droll you are ! Spring, indeed ! " cried Mrs. 
Macallister. " Is that the way you let your brother 
make game of people, Miss Halleck ? " She directed 



 

a good deal of her rattle at Olive ; she scarcely spoke 
to Marcia, but she was nevertheless furtively observ 
ant of her. Mr. Macallister had his rattle too, which, 
after trying it unsatisfactorily upon Marcia, lie plied 
almost exclusively for Olive. He made puns ; he 
asked conundrums ; he had all the accomplishments 
which keep people going in a lively, mirthful, colo 
nial society ; and he had the idea that he must pay 
attentions and promote repartee. His wife and he 
played into each other 's hands in their jeux iV esprit ; 
and kept Olive 's inquiring Boston mind at work in 
the vain endeavor to account for and to place them 
socially. Bartley hung about Mrs. Macallister, and 
was nearly as obedient as her husband. He felt that 
the Hallecks disapproved his behavior, and that made 
him enjoy it ; he was almost rudely negligent of 
Olive. 

The composition of the party left Marcia and Hal- 
leek necessarily to each other, and she accepted this 
arrangement in a sort of passive seriousness ; but 
Halleck saw that her thoughts wandered from her 
talk with him, and that her eyes were always turning 
with painful anxiety to Bartley. After their lunch, 
which left them with the whole afternoon before them, 
Marcia said, in a timid effort to resume her best 
leadership of the affair, " Bartley, don 't you think 
they would like to see the view from the Devil 's 
Backbone ? " 

" Would you like to see the view from the Devil 's 
Backbone ? " he asked in turn of Mrs. Macallister. 

"And what is the Devil 's Backbone?" she inquired. 

" It 's a ridge of rocks on the bluff above here," 
said Bartley, nodding his head vaguely towards the 
bank. 

" And how do you get to it ? " asked Mrs. Macallis 
ter, pointing her pretty chin at him in lifting her 
head to look. 


"Walk." 

" Thanks, then ; I shall try to be satisfied with me 
own backbone," said Mrs. Macallister, who had that 
freedom in alluding to her anatomy which marks the 
superior civilization of Great Britain and its colonial 
dependencies. 

" Carry you," suggested Bartley. 

" I dare say you d be very sure-footed ; but I d 
quite enough of donkeys in the hills at home." 

Bartley roared with the resolution of a man who 
will enjoy a joke at his own expense. 

Marcia turned away, and referred her invitation, 
with a glance, to Olive. 

" I don 't believe Miss Halleck wants to go," said 
Mr. Macallister. 

" I could n t," said Olive, regretfully. " I 've neither 
the feet nor the head for climbing over high rocky 
places. 

Marcia was about to sink down on the grass again, 
from which she had risen, in the hopes that her 
proposition would succeed, when Bartley called out : 
" Why don 't you show Ben the Devil 's Backbone ? 
The view is worth seeing, Halleck."
