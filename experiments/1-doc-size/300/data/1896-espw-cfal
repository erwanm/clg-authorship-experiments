from near my heart, and tore it, perhaps, 
accordingly. I wrote chiefly in the winters, at 
Andover, and revised at Gloucester. That 


last summer, I remember, was pushed with 
the proof-sheets of this book, crowding in
between the needs of my people. Many a morn 
ing's work was interrupted by the visits of the 
" reformed men ; " or by the little dissensions 
and troubles of their club organization ; or by 
signs of the coldness or opposition of those 
who might have aided us, and who would have 
done so I like to believe if they had ever 
understood our aims and motives. If there 
be one lesson above another which experience 
in moral reforms teaches a fair-minded person, 
I think it is patience with the averseness of 
those who do not join in our own particular 
methods of improving the world. Lack of 
sympathy with these is quite as likely to
signify want of head as want of heart ; or 
simply to indicate a deficient imagination, or one 
strung below its key. 

My own observation leads me to believe 
that when one has discovered for one's self 
this profound but subtle truth, one is just 
about ready to begin to enter upon a course 
or career of practical beneficence. As a rule, 
one is far on in such before one makes this 
discovery. For myself, the enforced end of my 
work at Gloucester and that illumination which 
would have made it so much easier and gentler 
to the enduring nerves, came together. As I 
 

say, " The Story of Avis " may have had its 
share in the sudden surrender of strength, 
which for a long time put an end to my use 
of my pen, and to all my hopes and visions of 
any personal part in alleviating the lot of the 
tempted men and suffering women of my sea 
port home. 

One evening in September, at the end of a 
worried summer, I came home from a service 
at the club-room with a strange lightness at 
the head. The moonlight on the harbor had a 
look which it never wore before or since ; an 
expression remote, as familiar scenery may 
appear, we think, to those about to leave the 
world forever. In that thrilling harbor-light, 
everything that one was doing or caring about 
took on a small look. Service for humanity 
itself acquired a vague value, and the fever of 
soul and body which fed it turned again and 
rent me. 

I sank on my pillow, faintly wishing that I 
need never leave it again, but perfectly aware 
that I should get up and go on at eight o clock 
to-morrow morning, as usual. Till dawn I 
watched the harbor throbbing under full moon 
and full tide. That night the watcher did not 
sleep ; nor the next ; nor the next. I closed 
my house suddenly, and fled to my father's 
home ; where, except in the great, uncontrollable 
crises of life, rest had always awaited 
me. This was no uncontrollable crisis ; nor 
even a crisis at all, that I could see ; and I 
" crawled in," as the grown child does, under 
a father's roof, confident of peace and healing. 
Neither came. The next night and the next 
passed like the others ; and then the rack of 
habitual insomnia closed in. 

One slips into the door of the torture 
chamber, thinking it to be the entrance to some 
commonplace apartment, perhaps some pleasant 
room with broad views and easy exit. 
One turns to step out, on some natural errand 
then, behold the bars, the bolts, the locks. 
Escape ? Try the windows. They seem to 
hang a million feet above the solid earth ; 
their grating is of metal never known before 
to the prisoner's chemistry, a relentless fibre, 
made from the pillars of the world. Weep if 
you will ; pray, if you choose. But " God shut 
the door." You will stay there till He opens 
it. 

It is not my purpose to turn even one chap 
ter of these recollections into an invalid's diary. 
Up to this point I have refrained from a subject 
always of so much more importance to 
the sufferer than to his friends, that one's 
preference would exile it from these records 
 

altogether. Since that is not quite practicable, 
it seems to me the simpler way to meet it as 
frankly and as briefly as possible. 

Perhaps we all have some plea more reason 
able than others, to account for the absence of 
the things which we have failed to be or to do. 
It has always seemed to me that the views 
taken by persons capable of " the vision and 
the dream," of the grounds on which they 
have omitted to reach . their ideal, would have 
an interest far above that of mere biographic 
personalities. What warning in this experience
of wasted aspiration ! What stimulus in 
that ! But here we come to the question : Is 
aspiration ever wasted ? Is achievement, or 
the effort to achieve, the essence of value ? 
When Sidney Colvin, Stevenson's particular 
critic, condemned "The Ebb-Tide," to my 
mind one of the best things which Stevenson 
ever did, the exiled and sinking man wrote 
pathetically : 

" The inherent tragedy of things works it 
self out from white to black and blacker, and 
the poor things of a day look ruefully on. 
Does it shake my cast-iron faith ? I cannot 
say it does. I believe in the ultimate decency 
of things ; ay, and if I woke in hell, should 
still believe it ! But it is hard walking ! . . . 

(Observe the cruelty give me a parenthesis 
to say it : This comfortable Englishman, 
tasting the fruits of the world, pouring what 
he called " criticism " on a dying man, prisoner 
in an island in the South Sea, where the mails 
come but once a month, and where a poor 
fellow might be buried before he could know 
that his book sold, or his critics repented them 
of their sins ! Facts like this deepen a natural 
skepticism as to the usefulness of the art of 
criticism into a fierce pang of resentment for 
the dying author's sake.) 

" I am an idler and a cumberer of the 
ground," he writes in one of the last letters 
to which he set his trembling pen. " It may 
be excused to me, perhaps, by twenty years of 
industry and ill health, which have taken the 
cream off the y milk. ... I am almost ready to 
call the world an error. Because ? Because I 
have not drugged myself with successful work, 
and there are all kinds of ... unfriendly 
trifles buzzing in my ear. If I could find a 
place where I could lie down and give up for 
(say) two years, and allow the sainted public 
to support me, if it were a lunatic asylum, 
wouldn't I go, just ! . . . But you men with 
salaries don't know how a family weighs on a 
fellow's mind." 

Stevenson is our latest and most pathetic 
specimen of the not inconsiderable list of 
invalid writers who have been important to the 
world ; and if the rest of them had " spoken 
out " as bluntly, as quaintly, and as wistfully 
as he, we might all have been the wiser or the 
gentler for their candor ; at least, all but those 
critics who appropriate wisdom and scorn gen 
tleness, and who will doubtless perceive in 
these very outcries of genius and of dissolution, 
wailing over from Samoa, a fault of syn 
tax, or an error in taste, or some pathological 
inefficiency, to be picked up and sported on 
the point of an easy pen. The solemn, antique 
writhing of power overcome by fate, the great 
attitude, like that of the Laocoon, the gran 
deur of strength rending its own weakness, 
the long, touching conflict of spirit with flesh, 
the massive determination crowding down physical 
disorder which would have killed a lesser 
creature twenty times over, twenty years be 
fore who is to rate all this in an estimate of 
the man's value to literature ? No one ; abso 
lutely no one who has not fought the lions of 
physical disease in the cage of a life bolted by 
the sharp need of daily bread ; no one who has 
not fought them with the sinew and the nerve 
of a creative genius. 

An invalid or disabled writer does not ask 
for the sops and gruels of the sick-room ; he 
does not expect his metre to be scanned by 


his headaches, or his perspicacity to be taken 
by the physician's thermometer. He is the 
last man toiling and suffering, to appeal to the 
stethoscope against his rhetoric or his construction. 
He asks nothing but fair play, and 
that fair sense which is the basis of fair play. 
In a word, he ought to be judged by the presence 
of a certain quality which suffering only 
gives, as well as by the absence of certain 
other qualities which are the properties of 
health alone. It is precisely this discrimina 
tion which is too often lacking in comfortable 
folk sitting easily on critics salaries and 
dictating through nerves cooled by the critical, not 
fevered by the creative, faculty. 

" I have a brave soul in a coward body," 
said one of our poets when he fainted under a 
painful accident. How is a champion football 
player to understand that ? 

Wise was Hazlitt, who wrote of " The inso 
lence of health." Rose Terry Cooke's physician 
said to her a few years before she died, 
" Every time you write you draw out of the 
very sources of your life." 

" No truly sensitive man," said Longfellow 
once to me, " can be perfectly well." He 
might have added that one of the cruelest 
problems of life is to make the perfectly well un 
derstand that he is not perfectly sensitive, 
 

and therefore may be disqualified from
comprehension of those who are. 

Far be it from me to the farthest limit of 
good sense to seem to undervalue by a semi 
tone the supremacy of physical sanity. Next 
to holiness, nothing is so enviable as health. 
I am not ashamed to say it I would rather 
be well than be Shakespeare. I would rather 
be a hearty, happy, strapping motor-man, or 
wood-chopper, or stoker, than But would 
I ? How can one tell ? " To understand the 
psychology of sheep," said George Eliot, " one 
must have been a sheep." To understand the 
mental attitude of health, one must have been 
descended of health and chosen of it. Ideally 
speaking, the robust mind in the robust body 
ought to be the keenest as well as the finest 
in this world. In point of fact, it often par 
takes too much of its own muscle ; the nerve 
of perception is bedded a little too deep in the 
fibre. 

A life-long invalid, herself a brave, patient, 
unselfish woman, absorbed in interests outside 
of her own suffering, and more useful to the 
world than most healthy people, said to me 
the wisest thing which I ever heard upon the 
subject, " The sick and the well do not 
understand each other." There is philosophy 
in this, which is worth heeding. It has 
occurred to me that a mediator is needed be 
tween health and disease, as there was be 
tween heaven and earth, as there is between 
virtue and vice, and certain other separated 
quantities or qualities. The physician does 
not fill this function, nor can he ; the reasons 
why he may not, are obvious. Most great 
human needs create their own supplies ; and 
this one may come, as soon as consciousness 
of its want reaches the stage of articulation, 
or, possibly, of clamor. 

Life, I believe, teaches most of us some one 
lesson supremely above all others. The 
literary artist will make over to the world that 
illumination which fate has kindled to the fair 
est flame in his own soul. He may " sketch " 
or " etch," he may " report " or " photograph," 
he may be realist or romanticist, he may have 
the light touch or the strong one but he 
will portray what he knows, and little else. 
Imagination is built upon knowledge, and his 
dreams will rest upon his facts. He is worth 
to the world just about what he has learned 
from it, and no more. 

I have sometimes thought that, before I put 
the shield on my stylographic pen for the last 
time, I should like to say to that little portion 
of the world which knows or cares for me at 
all, such things as I have discovered for my 
 

self about the relation of illness to energy, to 
sympathy, and to fortitude. Some of them 
seem to me worth saying though I may be 
wrong ; and even worth suffering to be 
qualified to say though on that I do not insist. 
But when one reflects on the books one never 
has written, and never may, though their schedules
