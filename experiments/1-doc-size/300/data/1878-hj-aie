that he had had, on the second day, with Bessie 
Alden. He had indeed had a good deal of talk 
with her, for she was not literally always in conversation with Lord Lambeth. He had medita 
ted upon Mrs. Westgate 's account of her sister, 
and he discovered for himself that the young 
lady was clever, and appeared to have read a 
great deal. She seemed very nice, though he 
could not make out that, as Mrs. Westgate had 
said, she was shy. If she was shy, she carried it 
off very well. 

" Mr. Beaumont," she had said, " please tell 
me something about Lord Lambeth 's family. 
How would you say it in England his position ?" 

" His position ?" Percy Beaumont repeated. 

"His rank, or whatever you call it. Unfor 
tunately we haven 't got a Peerage, like the 
people in Thackeray." 

" That 's a great pity," said Beaumont. " You 
would find it all set forth there so much better 
than I can do it." 

" He is a peer, then ?" 





" Oh yes, he is a peer." 

" And has he any other title than Lord Lainbeth ?" 

"His title is the Marquis of Lambeth," said 
Beaumont ; and then he was silent. Bessie Alden 
appeared to be looking at him with interest. 
" He is the son of the Duke of Bayswater," he 
added, presently. 

" The eldest son ?" 

" The only son." 

" And are his parents living ?" 

" Oh yes ; if his father were not living he 
would be a duke." 

" So that when his father dies," pursued Bessie 
Alden, with more simplicity than might have 
been expected in a clever girl, " he will become 
Duke of Bayswater ?" 

" Of course," said Percy Beaumont. " But his 
father is in excellent health." 

" And his mother ?" 

Beaumont smiled a little. "The Duchess is 
uncommonly robust." 

" And has he any sisters ?" 

" Yes, there are two." 

" And what are they called ?" 

" One of them is married. She is the Countess 
of Pimlico." 

"And the other?" 



  

"The other is unmarried; she is plain Lady 
Julia." 

Bessie Alden looked at him a moment. " Is 
she very plain ?" 

Beaumont began to laugh again. " You would 
not find her so handsome as her brother," he said ; 
and it was after this that he attempted to dissuade 
the heir of the Duke of Bayswater from accepting 
Mrs. Westgate 's invitation. "Depend upon it," 
he said, " that girl means to try for you." 

" It seems to me you are doing your best to make 
a fool of me," the modest young nobleman answered. 

" She has been asking me," said Beaumont, 
"all about your people and your possessions." 

" I am sure it is very good of her !" Lord Lambeth 
rejoined. 

" Well, then," observed his companion, " if you 
go, you go with your eyes open." 

"Damn my eyes!" exclaimed Lord Lambeth. 
" If one is to be a dozen times a day at the house, 
it is a great deal more convenient to sleep there. 
I am sick of travelling up and down this beastly 
avenue." 

Since he had determined to go, Percy Beaumont 
would, of course, have been very sorry to allow 
him to go alone ; he was a man of conscience, and 
he remembered his promise to the Duchess. It 





was obviously the memory of this promise that 
made him say to his companion a couple of days 
later that he rather wondered he should be so fond 
of that girl. 

" In the first place, how do you know how fond 
I am of her ?" asked Lord Lambeth. " And, in 
the second place, why shouldn 't I be fond of her ?" 

" I shouldn 't think she would be in your line." 

" What do you call my line ? You don 't set 
her down as fast ? " 

" Exactly so. Mrs. Westgate tells me that there 
is no such thing as the  fast girl in America ; that 
it 's an English invention, and that the term has 
no meaning here." 

" All the better. It 's an animal I detest." 

" You prefer a blue-stocking." 

" Is that what you call Miss Alden ?" 

" Her sister tells me," said Percy Beaumont, 
"that she is tremendously literary." 

" I don 't know any thing about that. She is 
certainly very clever." 

" Well," said Beaumont, " I should have sup 
posed you would have found that sort of thing 
awfully slow." 

"In point of fact," Lord Lambeth rejoined, "I 
find it uncommonly lively." 

After this, Percy Beaumont held his tongue ; 
but on the 10th of August he wrote to the Duchess 
of Bayswater. He was, as I have said, a man 
of conscience, and he had a strong, incorruptible 
sense of the proprieties of life. His kinsman, 
meanwhile, was having a great deal of talk with 
Bessie Alden on the red sea-rocks beyond the 
lawn; in the course of long island rides, with a 
slow return in the glowing twilight ; on the deep 
veranda late in the evening. Lord Lambeth, 
who had staid at many houses, had never staid at 
a house in which it was possible for a young man 
to converse so frequently with a young lady. This 
young lady no longer applied to Percy Beaumont 
for information concerning his lordship. She ad 
dressed herself directly to the young nobleman. 
She asked him a great many questions, some of 
which bored him a little ; for he took no pleasure 
in talking about himself. 

" Lord Lambeth," said Bessie Alden, " are you 
a hereditary legislator ?" 

" Oh, I say !" cried Lord Lambeth, " don 't make 
me call myself such names as that." 

" But you are a member of Parliament," said 
the young girl. 

" I don 't like the sound of that, either." 

" Don 't you sit in the House of Lords ?" Bessie 
Alden went on. 

" Very seldom," said Lord Lambeth. 

" Is it an important position ?" she asked. 


" Oh dear no," said Lord Lambeth. 

" I should think it would be very grand," said 
Bessie Alden, " to possess, simply by an accident 
of birth, the right to make laws for a great nation." 

"Ah, but one doesn 't make laws. It 's a great 
humbug." 

" I don 't believe that," the young girl declared- 
" It must be a great privilege, and I should think 
that if one thought of it in the right way from a 
high point of view it would be very inspiring." 

"The less one thinks of it the better," Lord 
Lambeth affirmed. 

" I think it 's tremendous," said Bessie Alden ; 
and on another occasion she asked him if he had 
any tenantry. Hereupon it was that, as I have 
said, he was a little bored. 

" Do you want to buy up their leases ?" he asked. 

"Well, have you got any livings?" she de 
manded. 

" Oh, I say !" he cried. " Have you got a clergyman that is looking out ?" But she made him tell 
her that he had a castle ; he confessed to but one. 
It was the place in which he had been born and 
brought up, and, as he had an old-time liking for 
it, he was beguiled into describing it a little, and 
saying it was really very jolly. Bessie Alden list 
ened with great interest, and declared that she 
would give the world to see such a place. Whereupon
" It would be awfully kind of you to come 
and stay there," said Lord Lambeth. He took a 
vague satisfaction in the circumstance that Percy 
Beaumont had not heard him make the remark I 
have just recorded. 

Mr. Westgate all this time had not, as they 
said at Newport, "come on." His wife more 
than once announced that she expected him on 
the morrow ; but on the morrow she wandered 
about a little, with a telegram in her jewelled 
lingers, declaring it was very tiresome that his 
business detained him in New York ; that he 
could only hope the Englishmen were having a 
good time. " I must say," said Mrs. Westgate, 
"that it is no thanks to him if you are." And 
she went on to explain, while she continued that 
slow-paced promenade which enabled her well- 
adjusted skirts to display themselves so advan 
tageously, that unfortunately in America there 
was no leisure class. It was Lord Lambeth 's 
theory, freely propounded when the young men 
were together, that Percy Beaumont was having 
a very good time with Mrs. Westgate, and that, 
under the pretext of meeting for the purpose of 
animated discussion, they were indulging in practices that imparted a shade of hypocrisy to the 
lady 's regret for her husband 's absence. 

"I assure you we are always discussing and 





differing," said Percy Beaumont. "She is awfully argumentative. American ladies certainly 
don 't mind contradicting you. Upon my word I 
don 't think I was ever treated so by a woman 
before. She 's so devilish positive." 

Mrs. Westgate 's positive quality, however, evidently had its attractions, for Beaumont was 
constantly at his hostess 's side. He detached 
himself one day to the extent of going to  New 
York to talk over the Tennessee Central with Mr. 
Westgate ; but he was absent only forty-eight 
hours, during which, with Mr. Westgate 's assist 
ance, he completely settled this piece of business. 
" They certainly do things quickly in New York," 
he observed to his cousin ; and he added that 
Mr. Westgate had seemed very uneasy lest his 
wife should miss her visitor he had been in 
such an awful hurry to send him back to her. 
"I'm afraid you'll never come up to an American 
husband, if that 's what the wives expect," ho 
said to Lord Lambeth. 

Mrs. Westgate, however, was not to enjoy much 
longer the entertainment with which an indulgent 
husband had desired to keep her provided. On 
the 21st of August Lord Lambeth received a telegram from his mother, requesting him to return 
immediately to England; his father had been 
taken ill, and it was his filial duty to come to him. 



  

The young Englishman was visibly annoyed. 
"What the deuce does it mean?" he asked of 
his kinsman. " What am I to do ?"
