' On Sunday night ? ' The Princess stared. ' Why, he 
was here yesterday, and he talked of it, and he told me 
nothing.' 





' That was quite right of him, bless him ! ' Muniment 
exclaimed. 

The Princess closed her eyes a moment, and when she 
opened them again Muniment had risen and was standing 
before her. ' What do they want him to do ? ' she asked. 

' I am like Hyacinth ; I think I had better not tell you 
at least till it's over.' 

' And when will it be over ? ' 

'They give him several days and, I believe, minute 
instructions,' said Muniment ; ' with, however, considerable 
discretion in respect to seizing his chance. The thing is 
made remarkably easy for him. All this I know from 
Schinkel, who himself knew nothing on Sunday, being a 
a mere medium of transmission, but who saw Hyacinth 
yesterday morning.' 

'Schinkel trusts you, then?' the Princess remarked. 

Muniment looked at her steadily a moment. ' Yes, but 
he won't trust you. Hyacinth is to receive a card of invita- 
tion to a certain big house,' he went on, ' a card with the 
name left in blank, so that he may fill it out himself. It is 
to be good for each of two grand parties which are to be 
given at a few days' interval. That's why they give him 
the job because at a grand party he'll look in his place.' 

' He will like that,' said the Princess, musingly ' repay- 
ing hospitality with a pistol-shot.' 

' If he doesn't like it he needn't do it.' 

The Princess made no rejoinder to this, but in a moment 
she said, ' I can easily find out the place you mean the 
big house where two parties are to be given at a few days' 
interval and where the master is worth your powder.' 
' Easily, no doubt. And do you want to warn him ? ' 



 

' No, I want to do the business first, so that it won't be 
left for another. If Hyacinth will look in his place at a 
grand party, should not I look still more in mine ? And as 
I know the individual I should be able to approach him 
without exciting the smallest suspicion.' 

Muniment appeared to consider her suggestion a moment, 
as if it were practical and interesting; but presently he 
answered, placidly, ' To fall by your hand would be too 
good for him.' 

' However he falls, will it be useful, valuable ? ' the Prin- 
cess asked. 

' It's worth trying. He's a very bad institution.' 

' And don't you mean to go near Hyacinth ? ' 

' No, I wish to leave him free,' Muniment answered. 

' Ah, Paul Muniment,' murmured the Princess, ' you are 
a first-rate man ! ' She sank down upon the sofa and sat 
looking up at him. ' In God's name, why have you told 
me this ? ' she broke out. 

' So that you should not be able to throw it up at me, 
later, that I had not.' 

She threw herself over, burying her face in the cushions, 
and remained so for some minutes, in silence. Muniment 
watched her awhile, without speaking; but at last he 
remarked, ' I don't want to aggravate you, but you will go 
back ! ' The words failed to cause her even to raise her 
head, and after a moment he quietly went out. 



XLVII 

THAT the Princess had done with him, done with him for 
ever, remained the most vivid impression that Hyacinth 
had carried -away from Madeira Crescent the night before. 
He went home, and he flung himself on his narrow bed, 
where the consolation of sleep again descended upon him. 
But he woke up with the earliest dawn, and the beginning 
of a new day was a quick revival of pain. He was over- 
past, he had become vague, he was extinct. The things 
that Sholto had said to him came back to him, and the 
compassion of foreknowledge that Madame Grandoni had 
shown him from the first. Of Paul Muniment he only 
thought to wonder whether he knew. An insurmountable 
desire to do justice to him, for the very reason that there 
might be a temptation to oblique thoughts, forbade him to 
challenge his friend even in imagination. He vaguely 
wondered whether he would ever be superseded ; but this 
possibility faded away in a stronger light a kind of dazzling 
vision of some great tribuneship, which swept before him 
now and again and in which the figure of the Princess 
herself seemed merged and extinguished. When full 
morning came at last, and he got up, it brought with it, 
in the restlessness which made it impossible to him to 
remain in his room, a return of that beginning of an 



 

answerless question, ' After all after all ? ' which the 

Princess had planted there the night before when she 
spoke so bravely in the name of the Revolution. ' After 
all after all, since nothing else was tried, or would, ap- 
parently, ever be tried ' He had a sense of his mind, 

which had been made up, falling to pieces again ; but that 
sense in turn lost itself in a shudder which was already 
familiar the horror of the public reappearance, on his part, 
of the imbrued hands of his mother. This loathing of the 
idea of a repetition had not been sharp, strangely enough, 
till his summons came ; in all his previous meditations the 
growth of his reluctance to act for the ' party of action ' 
had not been the fear of a personal stain, but the simple 
extension of his observation. Yet now the idea of the 
personal stain made him horribly sick ; it seemed by itself 
to make service impossible. It rose before him like a 
kind of backward accusation of his mother ; to suffer it 
to start out in the life of her son was in a manner to place 
her own forgotten, redeemed pollution again in the eye of 
the world. The thought that was most of all with him 
was that he had time he had time ; he was grateful for 
that, and saw a kind of delicacy in their having given him 
a margin not condemned him to be pressed by the hours. 
He had another day, he had two days, he might take three, 
he might take several. He knew he should be terribly 
weary of them before they were over ; but for that matter 
they would be over whenever he liked. Anyhow, he went 
forth again into the streets, into the squares, into the parks, 
solicited by an aimless desire to steep himself yet once 
again in the great indifferent city which he knew and loved 
and which had had so many of his smiles and tears and 





confidences. The day was gray and damp, though no rain 
fell, and London had never appeared to him to wear more 
proudly and publicly the stamp of her imperial history. 
He passed slowly to and fro over Westminster bridge and 
watched the black barges drift on the great brown river, 
and looked up at the huge fretted palace that rose there as 
a fortress of the social order which he, like the young 
David, had been commissioned to attack with a sling and 
pebble. At last he made his way to St. James's Park, and 
he strolled about a long time. He revolved around it, and 
he went a considerable distance up the thoroughfare that 
communicates with Pimlico. He stopped at a certain 
point and came back again, and then he retraced his steps 
in the former direction. He looked in the windows of 
shops, and he looked in particular into the long, glazed 
expanse of that establishment in which, at that hour of the 
day, Millicent Henning discharged superior functions. 
Millicent's image had descended upon him after he came 
out, and now it moved before him as he went, it clung to 
him, it refused to quit him. He made, in truth, no effort 
to drive it away ; he held fast to it in return, and it mur- 
mured strange things in his ear. She had been so jolly to 
him on Sunday; she was such a strong, obvious, simple 
nature, with such a generous breast and such a freedom 
from the sophistries of civilisation. All that he had ever 
liked in her came back to him now with a finer air, and 
there was a moment, during which he hung over the 
rail of the bridge that spans the lake in St. James's 
Park and mechanically followed the movement of the swans, 
when he asked himself whether, at bottom, he hadn't liked 
her better, almost, than any one. He tried to think he 



 

had, he wanted to think he had, and he seemed to see the 
look her eyes would have if he should tell her that he had. 
Something of that sort had really passed between them on 
Sunday ; only the business that had come up since had 
superseded it. Now the taste of the vague, primitive 
comfort that his Sunday had given him came back to him, 
and he asked himself whether he mightn't know it a second 
time. After he had thought he couldn't again wish for 
anything, he found himself wishing that he might believe 
there was something Millicent could do for him. Mightn't 
she help him mightn't she even extricate him? He was 
looking into a window not that of her own shop when 
a vision rose before him of a quick flight with her, for an 
undefined purpose, to an undefined spot ; and he was glad, 
at that moment, to have his back turned to the people in 
the street, because his face suddenly grew red to the tips 
of his ears. Again and again, all the same, he indulged in 
the reflection that spontaneous, uncultivated minds often 
have inventions, inspirations. Moreover, whether Millicent 
should have any or not, he might at least feel her arms 
around him. He didn't exactly know what good it would 
do him or what door it would open ; but he should like it. 
The sensation was not one he could afford to defer, but the 
nearest moment at which he should be able to enjoy it would 
be that evening. He had thrown over everything, but she 
would be busy all day ; nevertheless, it would be a gain, 
it would be a kind of foretaste, to see her earlier, to have 
three words with her. He wrestled with the temptation to 
go into her haberdasher's, because he knew she didn't like 
it (he had tried it once, of old) ; as the visits of gentlemen, 
even when ostensible purchasers (there were people watch- 





ing about who could tell who was who), compromised her 
in the eyes of her employers. This was not an ordinary 
case, however ; and though he hovered about the place 
a long time, undecided, embarrassed, half ashamed, at last 
he went in, as by an irresistible necessity. He would just 
make an appointment with her, and a glance of the eye and 
a single word would suffice. He remembered his way 
through the labyrinth of the shop ; he knew that her de- 
partment was on the second floor. He walked through the 
place, which was crowded, as if he had as good a right as 
any one else ; and as he had entertained himself, on rising, 
with putting on his holiday garments, in which he made 
such a distinguished little figure, he was not suspected of 
any purpose more nefarious than that of looking for some 
nice thing to give a lady. He ascended the stairs, and 
found himself in a large room where made-up articles were 
exhibited and where, though there were twenty people in it, 
a glance told him he shouldn't find Millicent. She was 
perhaps in the next one, into which he passed by a wide 
opening. Here also were numerous purchasers, most of 
them ladies ; the men were but three or four, and the dis- 
posal of the wares was in the hands of neat young women 
attired in black dresses with long trains. At first it appeared 
to Hyacinth that the young woman he sought was even here 
not within sight, and he was turning away, to look elsewhere, 
when suddenly he perceived that a tall gentleman, standing 
in the middle of the room, was none other than Captain 
Sholto. It next became plain to him that the person 
standing upright before the Captain, as still as a lay-figure 
and with her back turned to Hyacinth, was the object of 
his own quest. In spite of her averted face he instantly 



 

recognised Millicent ; he knew her shop-attitude, the dres- 
sing of her hair behind, and the long, grand lines of 
her figure, draped in the last new thing. She was 
exhibiting this article to the Captain, and he was lost 
in contemplation. He had been beforehand with Hya- 
cinth as a false purchaser, but he imitated a real one 
better than our young man, as, with his eyes travelling 
up and down the front of Millicent's person, he frowned, 
consideringly, and rubbed his lower lip slowly with his 
walking-stick. Millicent stood admirably still, and the back- 
view of the garment she displayed was magnificent. Hyacinth, 
for a minute, stood as still as she. At the end of that 
minute he perceived that Sholto saw him, and for an instant 
he thought he was going to direct Millicent's attention to 
him. But Sholto only looked at him veryjiard, for a few 
seconds, without telling her he was there ; to enjoy that 
satisfaction he would wait till the interloper was gone. 
Hyacinth gazed back at him for the same length of time 
what these two pairs of eyes said to each other re- 
quires perhaps no definite mention and then turned 
away. 

That evening, about nine o'clock, the Princess Casamas- 
sima drove in a hansom to Hyacinth's lodgings in West- 
minster. The door of the house was a little open, and a 
man stood on the step, smoking his big pipe and looking up 
and down. The Princess, seeing him while she was still at 
some distance, had hoped he was Hyacinth, but he proved 
to be a very different figure indeed from her devoted young 
friend. He had not a forbidding countenance, but he 
looked very hard at her as she descended from her hansom 
and approached the door. She was used to being looked
