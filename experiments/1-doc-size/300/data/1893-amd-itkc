twenty-four, and had been in society six years. 
It was mortifying, to say the least. 

Yet, she admitted to herself that Sabrina had 
never been more beautiful, seldom as gracious. 
The little touch of coldness had often kept peo- 
ple at a distance. It was very well with your 
inferiors, and with the nouveaux riches^ but Sabrina 
had unconsciously carried it to extremes where 
men were concerned. And now she would surely 
be relegated to a second or third place, with these 
new " fads." 

" It is mortifying when we have both done our 
best for her," said Mrs. Vantine complainingly 





to her husband. " You have doubled her money, 
and I have given her every advantage. The next 
thing will be her going over to one of those 
'settlements' where you live with the poor and 
nurse them and wait on them. My opinion is 
that we pamper the poor too much. They ought 
to be set to work." 

" Yes,' said her husband indifferently, studying 
the list of stocks. 

Mrs. Vantine sighed. 

"I shall give a dance for the young people,' 
she began presently. "We have been fearfully 
dull this winter. And there are only three weeks 
more of the season. I felt sure Sabrina would 
be married by this Easter. If she will be so 
obstinate " — 

Mr. Vantine began to doze. 

But Miss Eastwood had not found it stupid. 
True, she had not danced as much, not tired her- 
self over trivialities. She had gone a little out of 
the old paths. With a delicate consideration she 
managed to bring pleasures to the fresh young 
souls who, in the first dawn of delight, could not 
believe in any hollowness. Some who had con- 
sidered her cold and exclusive, warmed to her, 
glanced at her wistfully, entreated little favors 
with hesitation, then adored her in so new a man- 
ner that Sabrina was surprised. Could she win 





Others to love her as Stacy had ? Could she be a 
friend to young girls, and influence them if even 
a little in the way of a more serious womanhood? 
It seemed to her as if the world was waking up 
on the subject, but it was only that her eyes were 
opened to discern earnest souls, such as there had 
been from the beginning. There was more heart 
even in conventional charity than she had be- 
lieved. 

Pearl had been called away by the illness of her 
brother, and then had gone to Florida with him 
and his wife. Sabrina had to welcome Mrs. 
Duane and induct her into her new home, to 
which she had added some gifts besides the 
piano. She studied Mrs. Duane with a new 
interest. The graces and dignity of her old- 
fashioned formalisms became her so well. She 
could recall some of the grandmothers in society 
who had just this quaint refinement, supposed to 
be an inheritance of blue blood. A little pros- 
perity and happiness had worked a wonderful 
transformation. How much was wasted every- 
where that might go far toward redeeming worthy 
people, instead of leaving them to want, misery, 
and despair. 

Rhea's bright dark eyes spoke eloquently ; yet 
her nature was not effusive. There had not been 
much sentiment among those with whom her 





early life had been spent, though they were often 
kind to each other. But no matter how intensely 
your soul went into your work, it was mere com- 
modity, and paid for by the money. You could 
not stop for sympathy, relentless toil hurried you 
on at such a pace. 

Wendover had been a revelation to Rhea Vas- 
ilis. She felt as if she had lived years since 
that close summer morninor when she had fainted 
at her work. Oh, what a delightful world it was, 
and she was so glad to live in it ! She did not 
mind being small and dark and lame, even when 
there were so many beautiful women and girls in 
the world. She had a home in one dear heart, 
with all her imperfections. 

Sabrina visited them, took them out in the 
carriage, and to several matinees that filled the 
child with speechless delight. She could only 
thank Miss Eastwood with eyes shining in tears 
that would have overflowed at a word. • 

Were there not others pining for a little pleas- 
ure in their dreary round. Why, she had never 
thought of it before ! 

One day Rhea looked wistfully at her as she 
seated herself in the pretty room and began to 
ask about her music practising. 

"I am going on very well, I believe, though 
perhaps I shall not come up to your highest 




hopes of me. I try my best. And the lessons 
in designing are a pleasure. But I keep thinking 
all the time it is so^uch for me to have, and 
the long hours of delightful leisure, the books to 
read, and all the ease " — 

" My dear child, you surely do not want to go 
back to the old life ? " Miss Eastwood asked in 
surprise. 

" Oh, no. And yet the work wasn't so bad when 
one was well. It was the terrible living. One day 
I went in to see some of the girls. There were 
two — if Miss Disbrowe had been here I should 
have asked her. I do not want to displease either 
of you " — 

Rhea hesitated, and turned from pale to red. 

" You surely did not go back to work ? " 

Rhea shook her head. "Though I found I could 
]! sell some designs, and that gave me courage to — 

to bring these poor girls here. They were living 
in ah attic — rents are so high for the very poor, 
you know. And there was a room I could let 
them have. Mrs. Duane agreed. We had called 
it Miss Pearl's room. But when she comes I can 
give her mine. And O Miss Eastwood ! you can 
hardly imagine the pleasure the few evenings they 
have been here. And the meals — so different 
from the little you can fix in your haste in the 
morning, and you come home so tired at night 





that you hardly care. It is the being with some- 
body, the pleasant talk, the interest, that is such 
a comfort. And they are sueh nice girls. One is 
an orphan, and the other has a wretched, drunken 
.father who used to beat her and turn her out-of- 
doors. And they pay what it cost them to live 
there. But you see I shouldn't want to spend 
Mrs. Duane's money on them, and I shall help it 
out. You will not think it " — 

Rhea's lip quivered. 

" My dear child, I think it very kind and lovely 
in you and Mrs. Duane." 

" I shall not neglect anything. I wanted you 
to feel that your plans for me would be kept stead- 
ily in my mind. But when I had so'much " — 

Had she learned her lesson so quickly ? Pearl's 
kindness was bringing in fourfold. And she, 
Sabrina, had once wondered if you were not likely 
to injure these people by taking them out of their 
narrow sphere. Who is least among you shall 
be greatest. Sabrina felt humbled by this simple 
endeavor. Yes, the greatest of all was to take 
another into the very heart of things. 

Not just now, but in the future, half a dozen 
years perhaps, when she should have become quite 
settled, and the question of marriage set aside, 
what if she were to make a home for some of the 
least of these who had missed their opportunity or 



\ 





been crowded out of it ! Girls with aching hearts 
and longing desires for beauty and improvement, 
who had gifts and tastes above the average, as 
this little Rhea. She could not keep Pearl as 
her exclusive friend. PearFs destiny was surely 
settled. Yes, she was glad she had stood aside, 
and not marred so lovely a purpose. 

For in Florida the Disbrowes had stumbled 
over Olmstead and Winchester. Pearl had said a 
good deal about Winchester in her recent letters, 
but been delicately silent as to Olmstead. Sabrina 
fancied she could read between the lines. Yes, 
Stacy had been right. And she had so much that 
surely she need not grudge this blessing to an- 
other. Yet there was a sudden, strange loneliness 
stretching out before her. 

On a late winter afternoon she sat pouring tea 
at one of the very elegant occasions where she 
was among the hostesses by special invitation. 
Her table had been a centre of attraction among 
men a little tired of the ingMue, They had been 
discussing some of the problems of the day, and 
people were beginning to consider Miss Eastwood 
curiously entertaining. 

Some one crossed the large room with an air 
and bearing that seemed suddenly to freshen the 
languid atmosphere. She felt the presence in 
every pulse before she even raised her eyes. He 



 

held out his hand and took hers in a warm, eager 
pressure that sent the blood thrilling through 
every pulse. 

" I wondered if I should find you," Parke Olmstead 
said in a low but inspiriting tone. "We just 
came in this morning. And you should see Win- 
chester ! You would hardly know him. There has 
been something beside mere pleasure, but that 
was very delightful. I have so much to tell you. 
Have you a cup of tea for me.^" 

It was quite late, and the women were thinning 
out. Even some of the men had the dinner hour 
in mind. Olmstead helped himself to a chair, so 
near that no one could come between. 

She handed him his tea. " And Pearl ? " she 
asked almost under her breath. 

"Very well, but longing for her Northern friends 
and her work." He smiled a little. " I am to 
report everything to her at once. I have been 
spending an hour with Mrs. Duane. How cosey 
they are in their little nest ! And how pretty 
Miss Vasilis has grown ! Then I was to lose no 
time in seeing you. Pearl has hungered for the 
very sight of you." 

" Pearl!" He did not say Miss Disbrowe. He 
must feel very much at home with her. Sabrina 
made a great effort. Was not this the thing -she 
had assented to in her secret heart. Why should 
it move her thus ? 




" When is she coming ? " Oh, if she were here 
this very instant Sabrina would feel stronger. 

" Th^ Disbrowes are to take a fortnight's jour- 
neying about, perhaps longer, though Mr. Dis- 
browe considers himself entirely recovered. I 
should have gone with them ; but Winchester had 
his head so full of plans, and there was some im- 
portant business. I have something to tell you 
about Pearl — she gave me permission, and I am 
to ask a great favor." He smiled mysteriously, 
talking low and in a rapid tone of voice. 

The picturesque throng surged to and fro. Miss 
Eastwood poured tea in her quiet, elegant fashion ;
