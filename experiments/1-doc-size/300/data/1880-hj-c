be refused, and how many refusals would have been 
required to give me my liberty ? " asked Bernard. 

" That question means nothing, because you never 
knew that I had again offered myself to Miss Vivian." 

" No ; you told me very little, considering all that 
you made me tell you." 

" I told you beforehand that I should do exactly as 
I chose." 

" You should have allowed me the same liberty ! " 

" Liberty ! " cried Gordon. " Hadn 't you liberty to 
range the whole world over ? Couldn 't he have 
found a thousand other women ? " 

" It is not for me to think so," said Angela, smiling 
a little. 

Gordon looked at her a moment. 

" Ah, you cared for him from the first ! " he cried. 

" I had seen him before I ever saw you," said the 

girl- 
Bernard suppressed an exclamation. There seemed 
to flash through these words a sort of retrospective 
confession which told him something that she had 
never directly told him. She blushed as soon as she 
had spoken, and Bernard found a beauty in this of 
which the brightness blinded him to the awkward 





aspect of the fact she had just presented to Gordon. 
At this fact Gordon stood starmg; then at last he 
apprehended it — largely. 

" Ah, then, it had been a plot between you ! " he 
cried out. 

Bernard and Angela exchanged a glance of pity. 

" We had met for five minutes, and had exchanged 
a few words before I came to Baden. It was in Italy 
— at Siena. It was a simple accident that I never 
told you," Bernard explained. 

"I wished that nothing should he said about it," 
said Angela. 

"Ah, you loved him !" Gordon exclaimed. 

Angela turned away — she went to the window. 
Bernard followed her for three seconds with his eyes ; 
then he went on — 

" If it were so, I had no reason to suppose it. You 
have accused me of deceiving you, but I deceived only 
myself You say I put you off your guard, but you 
should rather say you put me on mine. It was, 
thanks to that, that I fell into the most senseless, 
the most brutal of delusions. The delusion passed 
away — it had contained the germ of better things. 
I saw my error, and I bitterly repented of it ; and on 
the day you were married I felt free." 

" Ah, yes, I have no doubt you waited for that ! " 
cried Gordon. "It may interest you to know that 
my nyirriage is a miserable failure." 





" I am sorry to hear it — but I can't help it." 

" You have seen it with your own eyes. You know 
all about it, and I needn 't tell you." 

"My dear Mr. Wright," said Angela, pleadingly, 
turning round, " in Heaven's name, don't say that ! " 

" Why shouldn 't I say it ? I came here on purpose 
to say it. I came here with an intention — with a 
plan. You know what Blanche is — you needn 't pre- 
tend, for kindness to me, that you don't. You know 
what a precious, what an inestimable wife she must 
make me — how devoted, how sympathetic she must 
be, and what a household blessing at every hour of 
the day. Bernard can tell you all about us — he has 
seen us in the sanctity of our home." Gordon gave a 
bitter laugh and w'ent on, with the same strange, seri- 
ous air of explaining his plan. " She despises me, she 
hates me, she cares no more for me than for the but- 
ton on her glove — by which I mean that she doesn 't 
care a hundredth part as much. You may say that it 
serves me right, and that I have got what I deserve. 
I married her because she was silly. I wanted a silly 
wife ; I had an idea you were too wise. Oh, yes, that 's 
what I thought of you ! Blanche knew why I picked 
her out, and undertook to supply the article required. 
Heaven forgive her! She has certainly kept her en- 
gagement. But you can imagine how it must have 
made her like me — knowing why I picked her out ! 
She has disappointed me all the same. I tlought 





she had a heart ; but that was a mistake. It doesn 't 
matter, though, because everything is over between 
lis." 

" What do you mean, everything is over ? " Bernard 
demanded. 

"Everything will be over in a few weeks. Then 
I can speak to Miss Vivian seriously." 

" Ah ! I am glad to hear this is not serious," said 
Bernard. 

" Miss Vivian, wait a few weeks," Gordon went on. 
" Give me another chance then. Then it will be per- 
fectly right ; I shall be free." 

" You speak as if you were going to put an end to 
your wife ! " 

" She is rapidly putting an end to herself. She 
means to leave me." 

" Poor, unhappy man, do you know what you are 
saying ? " Angela murmured. 

" Perfectly. I came here to say it. She means to 
leave me, and I mean to offer her every facility. She 
is dying to take a lover, and she has got an excellent 
one waiting for her. Bernard knows whom I mean ; 
I don't know whether you do. She was ready to take 
one three months after our marriage. It is really 
very good of her to have waited all this time ; but I 
don't think she can go more tlian a week or two 
longer. She is recommended a southern climate, and 
I am pretty sure that in the course of another ten 




days I may count upon their starting together for the 
shores of the Mediterranean. The shores of the Medi- 
terranean, you know, are lovely, and I hope they will 
do her a world of good. As soon as they have left 
Paris I will let you know; and then you will of 
course admit that, virtually, I am free." 

" I don't understand you." 

" I suppose you are aware," said Gordon, " that we 
have the advantage of being natives of a country in 
which marriages may be legally dissolved." 

Angela stared ; then, softly — 

"Are you speaking of a divorce?" 

" I believe that is what they call it," Gordon an- 
swered, gazing back at her with his densely clouded 
blue eyes. " The lawyers do it for you ; and if she 
goes away with Lovelock, nothing will be more simple 
than for me to have it arranged." 

Angela stared, I say ; and Bernard was staring, too. 
Then the latter, turning away, broke out into a tre- 
mendous, irrepressible laugh. 

Gordon looked at him a moment ; then he said to 
Angela, with a deeper tremor in his voice — 

" He was my dearest friend." 

" I never felt more devoted to you than at this mo- 
ment ! " Bernard declared, smiling still. 

Gordon had fixed his sombre eyes upon the girl 
again. 

" Do you understand me now ? " 





Angela looked back at him for some instants. 

" Yes," she murmured at last. 

" And will you wait, and give me another chance? " 

"Yes," she said, in the same tone. 

Bernard uttered a quick exclamation, but Angela 
checked him with a glance, and Gordon looked from 
one of them to the other. 

" Can I trust you ? " Gordon asked. 

" I will make you happy," said Angela. 

Bernard wondered what under the sun she meant ; 
but he thought he might safely add — 

" I will abide by her choice." 

Gordon actually began to smile. 

" It won't be long, I think ; two or three weeks." 

Angela made no answer to this ; she fixed her eyes 
on the floor. 

" I shall see Blanche as often as possible," she pres- 
ently said. 

" By all means ! The more you see her the better 
you will understand me." 

" I understand you very well now. But you have 
shaken me very much, and you must leave me. I 
shall see you also — often." 

Gordon took up his hat and stick ; he saw that 
Bernard did not do the same. 

" And Bernard ? " he exclaimed. 

" I shall ask him to leave Paris," said Angela. 

" Will you go ? " 







" I will do what Angela requests ' said Bernard. 

" You have heard what she requests ; it 's for you to 
come now." 

"Ah, you must at least allow me to take leave ! " 
cried Bernard. 

Gordon went to the door, and when he had opened 
it he stood for a while, holding it and looking at his 
companions. Then — 

" I assure you she won't be long ! " he said to An- 
gela, and rapidly passed out. 

The others stood silent till they heard the outer 
door of the apartment close behind him. 

"And now please to elucidate ! " said Bernard, fold- 
ing his arms. 

Angela gave no answer for some moments; then 
she turned upon him a smile which appeared incon- 
gruous, but which her words presently helped to 
explain. 

" He is intensely in love with his wife ! " 



XXIX. 

This statement was very effective, but it might 
well have seemed at first to do more credit to her 
satiric powers than to her faculty of observation. 
This was the light in which it presented itself to 
Bernard; but, little by little, as she amplified the 
text, he grew to think well of it, and at last he was 
quite ready to place, as a triumph of sagacity, on a 
level with that other discovery which she had made 
the evening before and with regard to which his es- 
pecial errand to-day had been to congratulate her 
afresh. It brought him, however, less satisfaction 
than it appeared to bring to his clever companion ; 
for, as he observed plausibly enough, Gordon was 
quite out of his head, and, this being the case, of 
what importance was the   secret of his heart ?
