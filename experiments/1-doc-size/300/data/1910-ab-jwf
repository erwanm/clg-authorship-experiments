" She 's got the worst of all sicknesses," he said briefly. 
"She's old." 

" Can she cook ? " 

"She cooks, and likes it. Cooks well, too. What she 
doesn't like is being expected to hop round us three times 
and make us more comfortable than humans ought to be. 
Lyddy 's got beyond playing that kind of a game." 

His wife looked at the fire with a clarity of housewifely 
justice. 

" I suppose you pay her ? " she remarked. 

" Pay her ? Why, yes, of course I pay her. She 's laid up 
a little, but she depends on that for shrouds and things." 

" The girls are coming to-morrow." 

" Celia — " he hesitated. 

" And Lilian." 

"Celia better?" 

He was still jfumblingly anxious to show a proper interest, 
and yet thinking how dear, how very dear, the black book 
was at his side, the book he must not open, must hardly 
think of lest he fly to it. 

" Celia hasn't been ill." 

"You wrote me — " He looked into the fire as if he could 
perhaps summon up the telltale letter. "You said there was 
something the matter with her." 

" Oh, that ! " Her face took on the look of worry he knew 
so well, out of the useless proficiency gained in his acquaint- 
ance with her emotional distresses of one sort or another. 
" It 's quite a long story. I didn't mean she was sick. I meant 
she told lies." 

"Told lies? What about?" 



 





" Everything. It's come on her quite lately.' 

" What does she do ? Embroider what happens, or tell 
what hasn't happened ? " 

" Both. It's very serious, John. I don't know what to do 
with her." 

He spoke flippantly out of his amusement over what he 
felt was another of Catherine's mental tragedies. 

" Why don't you send her to a specialist ? Send her to 
an alienist?" 

" I should like to. I 've thought of it." 

" Good God ! don't put her under that kind of a lens. 
The child isn't mad." 

" No, but there's some lesion, there 's something abortive 
in her brain — " 

He stared at her. 

" I wish we didn't have to borrow terms for things," he 
said. " There 's no more damning sign of the times than lay- 
men using words and thinking they 've got somewhere by it. 
Say the girl 's a liar, if she is a liar. Don't fish out her brain 
and fumble with it." 

" But she 's my responsibility." 

He looked into the fire gloweringly and said nothing. 
He had heard a great deal about Catherine's responsibilities. 
They had almost [made him resolve, in a reactionary spite, 
that he would have none. 

" How is the other girl ? " he asked. 

" Lilian? So far — John, she's an enormous disappoint- 
ment." 

" Well, you don't care, do you ? Your aflfections aren't 
involved ? " 

"My affections, no. But Celia's arc." 

"Is she fond of her?" 

" Naturally. Her sister 1 " 



 





She looked at him as if the implication that sisters were not 
fond might be monstrous. Winterbourne thought he had 
heard of such cases, but he said nothing because he remem- 
bered that, with Catherine, the clever thing was to avoid 
argument. She had plenty of time for it, but it kept him from 
the fellowship of books. That striking him less like an in- 
vitation than a picture rescued from old days and thrown 
upon a screen before him for an instant, made him steal a 
glance at the book waiting there for him, patient, inscrutable, 
holding its beauties until the foolish mind got ready to aban- 
don these peddling discussions and come back to calms and 
sanities. His hand crept out toward his pipe, too ; but he 
withdrew it. That was one thing he could not remember 
about Catherine. She might not mind smoking, but it seemed 
reasonable that she did. 

Catherine was settling to a leisurely flow of talk, of the 
sort she chose, not the lazy interchange of trifles born out 
of the common air, sparks struck out as the breath comes, 
but stories interminably prolonged. Winterbourne hated 
them. He liked to embark himself on a monologue, specula- 
tion about the things in heaven and earth ; but an infinite 
number of parentheses opening his mind to the minds of 
tedious people, he abhorred. She continued, — 

" You know how we found Lilian ? " 

" I believe you wrote me." 

It was in one of the long letters constructed according to 
an ill-chosen method of page-numbering, he readily assumed. 
He knew how the letters looked, and how he faithfully 
studied through them from the first page to the finish, and 
then back to the second, which had to be tipped at right 
angles, when the whole could as easily have been written like 
a book. 

" It was on our way to New York, you know, the month 



 





after we came home from abroad. The train was stalled. 
We got out and went to spend the night at an inn in that 
little town. What was the name of that town ? I never can 
remember." 

Winterbourne shifted his feet, the one over the other. 

" Never mind the town," he suggested. " It 's probably 
not material." 

" No. Well, I shall think of it. And there was this girl. 
She had a ring, — it 's exactly like a story, — a little onyx 
ring, hung round her neck by a ribbon, because it was too 
little for her to wear. And that was so queer that it attracted 
Celia's notice. She began to talk to her. And Lilian told 
her name quite simply, — Elizabeth Hartwell." 

" I thought her name was Lilian." 

" Oh, no. We call her Lilian because it 's so much better 
for a singing name — Lilian Winterbourne. But her real 
name is Elizabeth Hartwell." 

"What condemned foolishness!" said Winterbourne, 
escaped into his normal habit of outcry. " As if you couldn't 
sing under one name as well as another. A crow doesn't 
caw because he 's a crow. If you called a thrush a catbird, it 
wouldn't alter his throat." 

"Oh, but it's most important! All those things are. 
We 've gone into it very deeply and we know. And what do 
you think she was actually doing when we found her ? " 

She paused for the effect of her dramatic climax. 

"Tying some kind of a trinket round her neck by a string, 
wasn't she ? " 

" No, no. The ring was round her neck. That 's how 
Celia recognized her. You see she had the mate to it. Some 
nice old gentleman — that is, I think he was old. It may be 
he was just middle-aged and seemed old to them — " 

" Catherine," broke in Winterbourne, so exactly in the 



 





tone of past fulminations that she jumped perceptibly in her 
chair, " Catherine, I don't care how old he was." 

" No, but these are facts, and I like to get them accurate. 
Well, when they were children, he took a fancy to them be- 
cause they were pretty and cunning, and he gave them these 
two little rings. Do you see ? " 

Winterbourne gripped his hands on the arms of his chair 
and waited. It was evident to him that he had broken his 
intent to be the courteous and patient host, and he meant to 
renew the guard on himself. 

"And now what," she was continuing, "what do you 
think she was actually doing when we found her? " 

He shook his head at the fire, gloomily. 

"She was washing a floor!" 

The tone of high triumph with which she delivered this 
at once convinced him that it was expected to have an enor- 
mous effect. 

" Good for her ! " he responded, cordially, though in the 
dark. 

" Yes, she was washing a floor, precisely like Agnes Sur- 
riage." 

Winterbourne remembered far more about the Greece of 
the Golden Age than about Great Britain's colonies; but his 
wife, innocent that she had failed of her eflfect, went on, — 

" Well, the girls were simply enchanted to find each other. 
Lilian doesn't say much, but I think she was enchanted, 
too. And then we heard her singing about her work, and we 
found she had this astounding voice — oh, rich and perfectly 
splendid." 

"That's good," said Winterbourne patiently. 

" Yes, wasn't it ? And then the question was, what to do 
about it ? " 

That was it, Winterbourne reasoned, in recognized de- 



 





spair. Catherine would have to do something about it. She 
couldn't find a priceless voice and refrain from peering at 
it and fingering it, and perhaps in the end somehow tarnish- 
ing it. 

" Here was this glorious voice," she continued, with high 
relish of her tale, '' and nothing was being done.' 
 " Wasn't she singing ? " 

" Yes, in the parlor, in the evening, to a melodeon. They 
called it an instrument. She called it so, too. Fancy ! " 

" They are honest people," said Winterbourne, who had 
no ear, save for the poetic description of a flute at dawn. 
"They're all instruments of torture." 

But she was ignoring him. These mild lunacies of his 
seemed to her, as they always had, the outbreak of the mas- 
culine, which was also the childlike mind. She had the 
theory, evolved from the surprises and griefs of her marital 
experience, that men are but children. If you take them 
otherwise, you are likely to die broken-hearted, of the disap- 
pointments they deal you. But a comprehensive scheme of 
their undeveloped soul is your only safeguard. This, she 
concluded, was one of the exigencies when she was not to 
mind, and she continued, — 

" We took her away at once. Celia wouldn't hear to any- 
thing else. I believe if I had refused her, she would have 
stayed herself." 

" Took her away from a good place where she was con-
