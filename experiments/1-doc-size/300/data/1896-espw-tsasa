reconsecrating himself at the communion hour. 

The choir rustled uneasily in their seats. The 
soprano covered her eyes with her well-gloved hand, 
and thought of the follies and regrets (she called 
them by these names) that beset the musical 
temperament. But the tenor turned his face away, 
and thought about his wife. Down the avenue, in 
the room of the " shut-in " woman, where the tele- 


phone carried the preacher's voice, a pathetic cry 
was heard : 

" Forgive ! Forgive ! Oh, if suffering had but 
made me better ! " 

But now the preacher's manner of address had 
changed again. Always remembering that it is now 
impossible to quote his language with any accuracy, 
we may venture to say that it ran in some such way 
as this : 

The Son of God, being of the Father, performed 
his Father's business. What do ye who bear his 
name ? What holy errands are ye about ? What 
miracles of consecration have ye wrought ? What 
marvels of the soul's life have ye achieved upon the 
earth since he left it to your trust ? 

He came to the sinful and the unhappy ; the 
despised and rejected were his friends ; to the poor 
he preached the Gospel ; the sick, and overlooked, 
and cast-out, the unloved and forgotten, the un 
fashionable and unpopular, he selected. These to 
his church on earth he left in charge. These he 
cherished. For such he had lived. For them he 
had suffered. For them he died. People of Saint 
Agatha's, where are they ? What have ye done to 
his beloved? Thou ancient church, honored and 
privileged and blessed among men, where are those 
little ones whom thy Master chose ? Up and down 
these godly aisles a man might look, he said, and 
see them not. Prosperity and complacency he saw 
before him ; poverty and humility he did not see. 
In the day when habit cannot reply for duty, what 
account will ye give of your betrayed trust? Will 
ye say : " Lord, we had a mission chapel. The 
curate is responsible for the lower classes. And, 
Lord, we take up the usual collections ; Saint Agatha's 
has always been called a generous church"? 

In the startled hush that met these preposterous 
words the preacher drew himself to his full height, 
and raised his hand. He had worn the white gown 
throughout the day's services, and the garment 
folded itself about his figure majestically. In the 
name of Christ, then, he commanded them : Where 
were those whom their Lord did love? Go, seek 
them. Go, find the saddest, sickest souls in ah  the 
town. Hasten, for the time is short. Search, for 
the message is of God. Church of Christ, produce 
his people to me, for I speak no more words before 
their substitutes ! 

Thus and there, abruptly, the preacher cast his 
audience from him, and disappeared from the chaneel. 
The service broke in consternation. The 
celebrated choir was not called upon to close the 
morning's worship. The soprano and the tenor 
exchanged glances of neglected dismay. The 
prayer-book remained unopened on the sacred desk. 
The desk itself was empty. The audience was, in 
fact, authoritatively dismissed dismissed without 
a benediction, like some obscure or erring thing that 
did not deserve it. 

The people stared in one another's faces for an 
astounded moment, and then, without words, with 
hanging heads, they moved to the open air and 
melted out of the church. 

The sexton rushed up to the vestryman, pale with 
fear. 

"Sir," he whispered, "he is not in the vestry- 
room. He has taken himself away God knows 
whither. What are we to do ? " 

" Trust him," replied the church officer, with a 
face of peace, " and God who sent him. Who he 
may be, I know no more than you ; but that he is 
a man of God I know. He is about his Father's 
business. Do not meddle with it." 

" Lord forbid ! " cried the sexton. " I d sooner 
meddle with something I can understand." 




Upon the afternoon of that long-remembered 
Sunday there was seen in Saint Agatha's the 
strangest sight that those ancient walls had 
witnessed since the corner-stone was laid with a silver 
trowel in the name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Ghost "whom we, this people, 
worship." 

Before the chimes rang for the vesper service, 
the house was filled. Before the bronze lips of the 
bells were mute, the pews were packed. Before the 
stranger reappeared, the nave and the transept over 
flowed. The startled sexton was a leaf before the 
wind of the surging crowd. He could not even 
enforce the fire-laws, and the very aisles were 
jammed. Who carried the story? How do such 
wraiths of rumors fly ? 

Every member of that church not absent from 
town or known to be ill in his bed sought his pew 
that afternoon. Many indeed left their sick-rooms 
to be present at that long-remembered service. But 
no man or woman of these came alone. Each 
brought a chosen companion ; many, two or three ; 
some came accompanied by half a dozen worshipers : 
and upon these invited guests Saint Agatha's looked 
with an astonishment that seemed to be half shame ; 




for up those velvet aisles there moved an array of 
human faces at which the very angels and virtues 
in the painted windows seemed to turn their heads 
and stare. 

Such wretchedness, such pallor, hunger, cold, 
envy, sickness, sin, and shame were as unknown to 
those dedicated and decorated walls as the inmates 
of hell. Rags and disease, uncleanliness and woe 
and want, trod the house of God as if they had the 
right there. Every pew in the church was thrown 
open. Tattered blanket shawls jostled velvet cloaks, 
and worn little tan-colored reefers, half concealing 
the shivering cotton blouses of last summer, rubbed 
against sealskin furs that swept from throat to foot. 
Wretched men, called in by the throb of repentance 
that follows a debauch, lifted their haggard eyes to 
the chancel from the pews of the wardens, and 
women of the town sat gently beside the " first 
ladies " of the parish and of the city. There were 
a few ragged children in the audience, wan and 
shrewd, sitting drearily beside mothers to whom 
they did not cling. The pew of our friend, the 
vestryman, was filled to overflowing. The wife 
with the under lip sat beside him, and did not
protest. She had herself gone with him to the hospital 



to select their guests. For their pew was filled with 
the crippled and other sick who could neither walk 
nor afford to ride, and whom their own carriage had 
brought to Saint Agatha s. One of these, a woman, 
came on crutches, and the lady helped her, not 
knowing in the least how to do it ; and a man who 
had not used his feet for six years was lifted in by 
the pew-owner and his coachman and butler, and 
carried the length of the broad aisle. 

The church, as we say, was packed long before 
the preacher appeared. He came punctually to his 
appointment, like any ordinary man. It was mid- 
afternoon, and the sun was declining when he 
glided across the chancel. Already shadows were 
lying heavily in the corners of the church and under 
the galleries on the darker side. A few lights were 
glimmering about the chancel, but these served only 
to illuminate the stranger's form and face ; they did 
not lighten the mass of hushed and appealing hu 
manity before him. 

The choir, with bowed heads, just above the 
breath, began to chant : 

Who shall lay anything to the charge 

Of God's Elect ? 

It is God that justifieth, 

It is Christ that died. 




While they sang the preacher stood quite still and 
looked at the people, that strange and motley mass, 
the rich and the poor, the sick and the well, the 
disgraced and the reputable, the pampered and the 
starving, the shameful and the clean of life, the 
happy and the wretched together. When the sing, 
ing ceased, he spoke as if he talked right on ; he 
read no prayers ; he turned to no ritual ; he did not 
even use the great Bible of Saint Agatha's but 
only spoke in a quiet way, like a man who continues 
a thought begun : 

" For the Lord," he said, " is the maker of you 
all." 

There was no sermon in Saint Agatha's that after 
noon. Ecclesiastically speaking, there was no 
service. But the preacher spoke to the people; and 
their hearts hung upon his words. But what those 
words were no man may tell us at this day. 

It has been whispered, indeed, that what he said 
took different meanings to the members of that 
strange audience. Each heart received its own 
message. Wide as the earth were the gulfs between 
those hearers. But the preacher's message bridged 
them all. From his quivering lip and melting voice 
each soul drank the water of life. Afterwards each 



 

kept its own secret, and told not of that thirst, or 
of its assuaging. 

"He speaks to me/ sighed the patrician, with 
bowed head. "How happens this, for I thought 
no man did know that inner history ? I have never 
told" 

" To me ! To me ! " sohbed the pauper and the 
castaway " the preacher speaks to me. My misery, 
my shame the whole world knows, but no man 
ever understood before." 

The afternoon waned. The shadows deepened 
under the galleries. The great house clung like 
one child to the voice of the preacher. It was as 
still as the courts of Heaven when a soul is 
pardoned. The stranger spoke in a low but penetrat 
ing voice. Not a word was lost by the remotest. 
He spoke of the love of God the Father, and of the 
life of Christ the Son. He spoke of sin and of for 
giveness, of sorrow, of shame, and of peace. He 
spoke of sacrifice, of patience, of purity, and of 
hope, and of the eternal life. 

Not once did he allude to the petty differences 
among the people who sat bowed and breathless 
before him. Such paltry things as riches or 
poverty, or position, or obscurity, he did not recognize. 



 

He spoke to men and women, the children of God. 
He spoke to sinners and to sufferers, and to patient 
saints ; he said nothing about " classes ; " he talked 
of human beings ; he rebuked them for their sins ; 
he comforted them for their miseries ; he smote their 
hearts ; he shook their souls ; he passed over then- 
lives as conflagration passes, burning to ashes, 
purifying to new growth. 

As he spoke, the manner of his countenance 
changed before them, like that of any great and holy 
man who is charged with the burden of souls, and 
who persuadeth them. A fine, inner light glowed 
through his features, as a sacred lamp glows through 
alabaster or some exquisite shell. His plaintive lip 
trembled. His deep eyes burned and retreated, as 
if they veiled themselves. An expression dazzling 
to behold settled upon his face. His white garment 
gathered light, and shone. Suddenly pausing, he 
stretched forth his hands. What delicate arrange 
ment of the chancel lamps illuminated them ? It was 
noticed by many, and spoken of afterwards below 
the breath. For, as he raised them in benediction 
upon the people, there scintillated from the palms a 
light. Some said that it was reflected from the 
radiance of the man's face. Some said that it had 




The face of the stranger swam before her "
