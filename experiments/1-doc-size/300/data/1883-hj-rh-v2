sent on these occasions. Rowland saw him little at other 
times, and for three weeks no observations passed between 
them on the subject of Mrs. Hudson 's advent. To Row 
land 's vision, as the weeks elapsed, the benefits to proceed 
from the presence of the two ladies remained shrouded in 
mystery. Roderick was peculiarly inscrutable. He was 
preoccupied with his work on his mother 's portrait, which 



 

was taking a very happy turn ; and often when he sat 
silent with his hands in his pockets, his legs outstretched, 
his head thrown back and his eyes on vacancy, it was to 
be supposed that his fancy was hovering about the half- 
shaped image in his studio, exquisite even in its imma 
turity. He said little, but his silence did not of necessity 
imply disaffection, for he evidently found it a deep 
personal luxury to lounge away the hours in an atmosphere 
so charged with feminine tenderness. He was not alert, 
he suggested nothing in the way of excursions (Rowland 
was the prime mover in such as were attempted), but he 
conformed, passively at least, to the tranquil temper of the 
two women, and made no harsh comments nor sombre 
allusions. Rowland wondered whether he had, after all, 
done his friend injustice in denying him the sentiment 
of duty. He refused invitations, to Rowland 's knowledge, 
in order to dine at the sordid little table-d hote ; wherever 
his spirit might be, he \vas present in the flesh with reli- 
ligious constancy. Mrs. Hudson 's felicity betrayed itself 
in a remarkable tendency to finish her sentences and wear 
her best black silk gown. Her tremors had trembled 
away ; she was like a child who discovers that the 
shaggy monster it has so long been afraid to touch is an 
inanimate terror compounded of straw and sawdust, and 
that it is even a safe audacity to tickle its nose. As to 
whether the love-knot of which Mary Garland had the 
keeping still held firm, who should pronounce ? The 
young girl, as we know, did not wear it on her sleeve. 
She always sat at the table, near the candles, with a piece 
of needlework. This was the attitude in which Rowland 
had first seen her, and he thought, now that he had seen 
her in several others, that it was not the least becoming. 



 



XIX. 

THERE occurred at last a couple of days during which 
Rowland was unable to go to the hotel. Late in the 
evening of the second Roderick came into his room. In 
a few moments he announced that he had finished the 
bust of his mother. 

"And it 's magnificent !" he declared. "It 's one of 
the best things I have done." 

. "I am delighted to hear it," said Rowland. " Never 
again talk to me about your inspiration being dead." 

" Why not ? This may be its last kick ! I feel veiy 
tired. But it 's a masterpiece, though I do say it. They 
tell us we owe so much to our parents. Well, I have 
paid the filial debt handsomely !" He walked up and 
down the room a few moments, with the purpose of his 
visit evidently still hanging fire. There 's one thing 
more I want to say," he presently resumed. " I feel as 
if I ought to tell you !" He stopped before Rowland 
with his head high and his brilliant glance unclouded. 
Your invention is a failure ! " 

" My invention ?" Rowland repeated. 

" Bringing out my mother and Mary." 

"A failure?" 

" It 's no use ! They don 't help me." 

Rowland had fancied that Roderick had no more 
surprises for him ; but he was now staring at him wide- 
eyed. 

"They bore me !" Roderick went on. 

"Oh, oh !" cried Rowland. 

"Listen, listen !" said Roderick, with perfect gentle 
ness. "I am not complaining of them; I am simply 
stating a fact. I am very sorry for them ; I am greatly 
disappointed." 

" Have you given them a fair trial?" 



 

" Shouldn 't you say so ? It seems to me I have 
behaved beautifully." 

"You have done very well; I have been building 
great hopes on it." 

I have done too well, then. After the first forty- 
eight hours my own hopes collapsed. But I determined 
to fight it out ; to stand within the temple ; to let the 
spirit of the Lord descend ! Do you want to know the 
result ? Another week of it and I shall begin to hate 
them. I shall want to poison them." 

"Miserable boy!" cried Rowland. "They are the 
most perfect of women ! " 

" Very likely ! But they mean no more to me than a 
Bible text means to an atheist !" 

"I can say this," said Rowland, in a moment. " I 
don 't pretend to understand the state of your relations 
with Miss Garland." 

Roderick shrugged his shoulders and let his hands 
drop at his sides. " She adores me ! That 's the state 
of my relations." And he smiled strangely. 

" Have you broken off your engagement?" 

" Broken it off ? You can't break a ray of moonshine. " 

" Have you absolutely no affection for her?" 

Roderick placed his hand on his heart and held it there 
a moment. "Dead dead dead !" he said at last. 

"I wonder," Rowland observed presently, "if you 
really know what a charming girl she is. She 's an 
awfully charming girl." 

" Evidently or I should not have cared for her !" 

" don 't you care for her now, then ?" 

" Oh, don 't force a fellow to say rude things !" 

"Well, I can only say that you don 't know what you 
are giving up." 

Roderick gave a quickened glance. Do you know 
so well?" 

"You must admit that you have allowed me time to 
find out !" 



 

Roderick smiled, I may almost say sympathetically. 
" Well, you haven't wasted it !" 

Rowland 's thoughts were crowding upon him fast. 
If Roderick was resolute, why should he be gainsaid ? 
If Mary was to be sacrificed, why in that way try to save 
her ? There was another way ; it only needed a little 
presumption to make it possible. Rowland tried to 
summon presumption to his aid ; but whether it should 
come or not it was to find conscience there before it. 
Conscience had only three words, but they were cogent. 
" For her sake for her sake," it dumbly murmured, 
and Rowland resumed his argument. " I don 't know 
what I wouldn 't do," he said, "rather than that Miss 
Garland should be ill-used." 

"There is one thing to be said." Roderick answered, 
reflectively. " She is very strong." 

" Well, then, if she 's strong, believe that with a longer 
chance, a better chance, she will still regain your affec 
tion. " 

"Do you know what you ask?" cried Roderick. 
" Make love to a girl I hate ?" 

"You hotel" 

"As her lover I should hate her! Do you really 
urge my marrying a woman who would bore me to 
death ? I shouldn 't be long in letting her know it, and 
then, pray, where would she be?" Roderick asked, im 
patiently. 

Rowland walked the length of the room a couple of 
times and then stopped suddenly. " Go your way, then ! 
Say all this to her, not to me !" 

"To her? I am afraid of her ; I want you to help 
me." 

" My dear Roderick," said Rowland, with an eloquent 
smile, I can't help you any more ! " 

Roderick frowned, hesitated a moment, and then took 
his hat. "Oh, well," he said, "I am not so afraid of 
her as all that !" And he turned as if to depart. 



 

"Stop !" cried Rowland, as he laid his hand on the 
door. 

Roderick paused, and stood waiting with his irritated 
brow. 

"Come back ; sit down there and listen to me. Of 
anything you say in your present state of mind you will 
live most bitterly to repent. You don 't know what you 
really think ; you don 't know what you really feel. You 
don 't know your own mind ; you don 't do justice to Miss 
Garland. All this is impossible here, under these circum 
stances. You are blind, you are deaf, you are under a 
spell. To break it you must leave Rome." 

"Leave Rome ! Rome was never so dear to me." 

"That 's not of the smallest consequence. Leave it 
instantly." 

"And where shall I go?" 

" Go to some place where you may be alone with your 
mother and your cousin." 

" Alone ? You will not come ?" 

" Oh, if you wish it I will come." 

Roderick, inclining his head a little, looked at his friend 
askance. " I don 't understand you," he said ; " I wish 
you liked Mary either a little less or a little more." 

Rowland felt himself colouring, but he paid no heed 
to this speech. " You ask me to help you," he went on. 
" On these present terms I can do nothing. But if you 
will be perfectly quiet with regard to Miss Garland for a 
couple of months, and meanwhile leave Rome, leave 
Italy, I will do what I can to help you, as you say, in 
the event of your still wishing to be liberated. " 

" I must do without your help, then ! Your terms are 
impossible. I will leave Rome at the time I have always 
intended at the end of June. My rooms and my mother 's 
are taken till then ; all my arrangements are made accord 
ingly. Then I will go not before." 

"You are not frank," said Rowland. "Your real 
reason for staying has nothing to do with your rooms. " 



Roderick 's face betrayed neither embarrassment nor 
resentment. " If I am not frank, it 's for the first time 
in my life. Since you know so much about my real 
reason, let me hear it ! No, stop !" he suddenly added, 
" I won't trouble you. You are right, I have a motive. 
On the twenty-fourth of June Christina Light is to be 
married. I take an immense interest in all that concerns 
her, and I wish to be present at her marriage." 

" But you said the other day at Saint Peter 's that it 
was by no means certain it would take place." 

" Apparently I was wrong ; I am told that the invita 
tions are going out." 

Rowland felt that it would be vain to remonstrate, and 
that the only thing for him was to make the best bargain 
possible. " If I offer no farther opposition to your wait 
ing for Christina 's marriage," he said, " will you promise, 
meanwhile and afterwards, for a certain period, to defer 
to my judgment to say or do nothing that may give the 
alarm to Miss Garland?" 

"For a certain period? What period?" Roderick 
demanded. 

"Ah, don 't screw me down so! don 't you under 
stand that I have taken you away from her, that I suffer 
in every nerve in consequence, and that I must do what 
I can to give you back ? " 

" Do what you can, then," said Roderick, putting out 
his hand. "Do what you can!" His tone and his 
hand-shake seemed to constitute a promise, and upon
