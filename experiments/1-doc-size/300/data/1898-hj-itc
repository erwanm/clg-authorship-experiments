could bear any man so smugly unconscious 
of the immensity of her difference. It was 
just for this difference that, if she was to be 
liked at all, she wanted to be liked, and if 
that was not the source of Mr. Mudge 's 
admiration, she asked herself, what on earth 
could be? She was not different only at one 
point, she was different all round; unless 
perhaps indeed in being practically human, 
which her mind just barely recognised that 
he also was. She would have made tremen 
dous concessions in other quarters: there 
was no limit, for instance, to those she would 
have made to Captain Everard ; but what I 
have named was the most she was prepared 
to do for Mr. Mudge. It was because he 
was different that, in the oddest way, she 
liked as well as deplored him; which was 
after all a proof that the disparity, should 
they frankly recognise it, wouldn't neces 
sarily be fatal. She felt that, oleaginous 
too oleaginous as he was, he was somehow 
comparatively primitive: she had once, 
during the portion of his time at Cocker 's 





that had overlapped her own, seen him 
collar *a drunken soldier, a big, violent man, 
who, having come in with a mate to get a 
postal-order cashed, had made a grab at the 
money before his friend could reach it and 
had so produced, among the hams and 
cheeses and the lodgers from Thrupp's, 
reprisals instantly ensuing, a scene of scan 
dal and consternation. Mr. Buckton and the 
counter-clerk had crouched within the cage, 
but Mr. Mudge had, with a very quiet but 
very quick slep round the counter, trium 
phantly interposed in the scrimmage, parted 
the combatants and shaken the delinquent 
in his skin. She had been proud of him at 
that moment and had felt that if their affair 
had not already been settled the neatness 
of his execution would have left her with 
out resistance. 

Their affair had been settled by other 
things: by the evident sincerity of his passion 
and by the sense that his high white apron 
resembled a front of many floors. It had 
gone a great way with her that he would 





build up a business to his chin, which 
he carried quite in the air. This could 
only be a question of time ; he would have 
all Piccadilly in the pen behind his ear. 
That was a merit in itself for a girl who had 
known what she had known. There were 
hours at which she even found him good- 
looking, though, frankly, there could be no 
crown for her effort to imagine, on the part 
of the tailor or the barber, some such treat 
ment of his appearance as would make him 
resemble even remotely a gentleman. His 
very beauty was the beauty of a grocer, and 
the finest future would offer it none too much 
room to expand. She had engaged herself, 
in short, to the perfection of a type, and 
perfection of anything was much for a per 
son who, out of early troubles, had just 
escaped with her life. But it contributed 
hugely at present to carry on the two paral 
lel lines of her contacts in the cage and her 
contacts out of it. After keeping quiet for 
some time about this opposition she sud 
denly one Sunday afternoon on a penny 





chair in the Regent 's Park broke, for him, 
capriciously, bewilderingly, into an intima 
tion of what it came to. He naturally pressed 
more and more on the subject of her again 
placing herself where he could see her 
hourly, and for her to recognise that since 
she had as yet given him no sane reason for 
delay she had no need to hear him say that 
he couldn't make out what she was up to. As 
if, with her absurd bad reasons, she knew it 
herself! Sometimes she thought it would 
be amusing to let him have them full in the 
face, for she felt she should die of him unless 
she once in a while stupefied him ; and some 
times she thought it would be disgusting and 
perhaps even fatal. She liked him, how 
ever, to think her silly, for that gave her the 
margin which, at the best, she would always 
require; and the only difficulty about this 
was that he hadn't enough imagination to 
oblige her. It produced, none the less, 
something of the desired effect to leave him 
simply wondering why, over the matter of 
their reunion, she didn' t yield to his argu- 





ments. Then at last, simply as if by acci 
dent and out of mere boredom on a day that 
was rather flat, she preposterously produced 
her own. Well, wait a bit. Where I am I 
still see things. And she talked to him 
even worse, if possible, than she had talked 
to Mrs. Jordan. 

Little by little, to her own stupefaction, 
she caught that he was trying to take it as 
she meant it and that he was neither aston 
ished nor angry. Oh, the British trades 
man this gave her an idea of his resources ! 
Mr. Mudge would be angry only with a 
person who, like the drunken soldier in the 
shop, should have an unfavourable effect 
upon business. He seemed positively to 
enter, for the time and without the faintest 
flash of irony or ripple of laughter, into the 
whimsical grounds of her enjoyment of 
Cocker 's custom, and instantly to be casting 
up whatever it might, as Mrs. Jordan had 
said, lead to. What he had in mind was 
not, of course, what Mrs. Jordan had had : it 
was obviously not a source of speculation 





with him that his sweetheart might pick up 
a husband. She could see perfectly that 
this was not, for a moment, even what he 
supposed she herself dreamed of. What 
she had done was simply to give his fancy 
another push into the dim vast of trade. In 
that direction it was all alert, and she had 
whisked before it the mild fragrance of a 
connection. That was the most he could 
see in any picture of her keeping in with the 
gentry ; and when, getting to the bottom of 
this, she quickly proceeded to show him the 
kind of eye she turned on such people and 
to give him a sketch of what that eye dis 
covered, she reduced him to the particular 
confusion in which he could still be amusing 
to her.

They're the most awful wretches, I assure 
you the lot all about there. 

Then why do you want to stay among 
them? 

My dear man, just because they are. It 
makes me hate them so. 

Hate them? I thought you liked them. 

Don't be stupid. What I "like" is just 
to loathe them. You wouldn't believe what 
passes before my eyes. 

Then why have you never told me? You 
didn' t mention anything before I left. 

Oh, I hadn't got into it then. It 's the 
sort of thing you don't believe at first; you 
have to look round you a bit and then you 
understand. You work into it more and 
more. Besides, the girl went on, this is 
the time of the year when the worst lot come 
up. They're simply packed together in 

those smart streets. Talk of the numbers 






of the poor! What  I  can vouch for is the 
numbers of the rich ! There are new ones 
every day, and they seem to get richer and 
richer. Oh, they do come up! she cried, 
imitating, for her private recreation she 
was sure it wouldn't reach Mr. Mudge the 
low intonation of the counter-clerk. 

And where do they come from? her com 
panion candidly inquired. 

She had to think a moment; then she 
found something. From the "spring meet 
ings. " They bet tremendously. 

Well, they bet enough at Chalk Farm, if 
that 's all. 

It isn' t all. It isn' t a millionth part! she 
replied with some sharpness. It 's immense 
fun she would tantalise him. Then, as she 
had heard Mrs. Jordan say, and as the 
ladies at Cockers even sometimes wired, It 's 
quite too dreadful! She could fully feel 
how it was Mr. Mudge 's propriety, which 
was extreme he had a horror of coarseness 
and attended a Wesleyan chapel that pre 
vented his asking for details. But she gave 





him some of the more innocuous in spite of 
himself, especially putting before him how, 
at Simpkin 's and Ladle's, they all made the 
money fly. That was indeed what he liked 
to hear : the connection was not direct, but 
one was somehow more in the right place 
where the money was flying than where it 
was simply and meagrely nesting. It 
enlivened the air, he had to acknowledge, 
much less at Chalk Farm than in the dis 
trict in which his beloved so oddly enjoyed 
her footing. She gave him, she could see, 
a restless sense that these might be familiari 
ties not to be sacrificed; germs, possibilities, 
faint foreshowings heaven knew what 
of the initiation it would prove profitable to 
have arrived at when, in the fulness of time, 
he should have his own shop in some such 
paradise. What really touched him that 
was discernible was that she could feed him 
with so much mere vividness of reminder, 
keep before him, as by the play of a fan, the 
very wind of the swift banknotes and the 
charm of the existence of a class that Provi- 



7 o   

dence had raised up to be the blessing of 
grocers. He liked to think that the class was 
there, that it was always there, and that she 
contributed in her slight but appreciable 
degree to keep it up to the mark. He 
couldn't have formulated his theory of the 
matter, but the exuberance of the aristocracy 
was the advantage of trade, and everything 
was knit together in a richness of pattern 
that it was good to follow with one 's finger 
tips. It was a comfort to him to be thus 
assured that there were no symptoms of a 
drop. What did the sounder, as she called 
it, nimbly worked, do but keep the ball 
going? 

What it came to, therefore, for Mr. Mudge, 
was that all enjoyments were, in short, 
inter-related, and that the more people had 
the more they wanted to have. The more 
flirtations, as he might roughly express it, 
the more cheese and pickles. He had even 
in his own small way been dimly struck with 
the concatenation between the tender passion 
and cheap champagne. What he would have 





liked to say had he been able to work out his 
thought to the end was: I see, I see. Lash 
them up then, lead them on, keep them 
going: some of it can't help, some time,
