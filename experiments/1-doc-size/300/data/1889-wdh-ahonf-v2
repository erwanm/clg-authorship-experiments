" What do the infernal fools expect to live on ? " 

" The interest of their money, I suppose," said the 
ofEcer, with a grin of satisfaction in his irony. " It's 
got to run its course. Then they 'll come back with 
their heads tied up and their tails between their 
legs, and plead to be taken on again." 

" If I was a manager of the roads," said Beaton, 
thinking of how much he was already inconvenienced 
by the strike, and obscurely connecting it as one of the 
series with the wrongs he had suffered at the hands 
of Mrs. Horn and Mrs. Mandel, " I would see them 
starve before I 'd take them back— every one of  the m." 



  

" "Well," said the policeman impartially, as a man 
might whom the companies allowed to ride free, but 
who had made friends with a good many drivers 
and conductors in the course of his free riding, " I 
guess that 's what the roads avouM like to do if they 
could ; but the men are too many for them, and 
there ain't enough other men to take their places." 

" No matter," said Beaton severely. " They can 
bring in men from other places." 

" Oh, they 'll do that fast enough," said the police- 
man. 

A man came out of the saloon on the corner where 
the strikers were standing, noisy drunk, and they 
began, as they would have said, to have some fun 
with him. The policeman left Beaton, and sauntered 
slowly down toward the group as if in the natural 
course of an afternoon ramble. On the other side 
of the street Beaton could see another officer 
sauntering up from the block below. Looking up 
and down the avenue, so silent of its horse-car 
bells, he saw a policeman at every corner. It was 
rather impressive. 



III. 



The strike made a good deal of talk in the office 
of Every Other JFeeh — that is, it made Fulkerson talk 
a good deal. He congratulated himself that ho was 
not personally incommoded by it, like some of the 
fellows who lived up-town, and had not everything 
under one roof, as it were. He enjoyed the excite- 
ment of it, and he kept the office-boy running out 
to buy the extras which the newsmen came crying 
through the street almost every hour with a 
lamentable, unintelligible noise. He read not only 
the latest intelligence of the strike, but the editorial 
comments on it, which praised the firm attitude of 
both parties, and the admirable measures taken by 
the police to preserve order. Fulkerson enjoyed 
the interviews with the police captains and the 
leaders of the strike ; he equally enjoyed the 
attempts of the reporters to interview the road 
managers, which were so graphically detailed, and 
with such a fine feeling for the right use of scare- 
lieads as to have almost the value of direct expres- 
sions from them, though it seemed that they had 
resolutely refused to speak. He said, at second- 
hand from the papers, that if the men behaved 



  

themselves and rospectcd the riglits of property, 
they "would have i)ubHc sympatliy with them every 
time ; but just as soon as they began to interfere 
with the roads' right to manage their own affairs in 
their own way, they must be put down witli an 
iron hand; the plirase "iron hand "did Fulkerson 
almost as much good as if it liad never been used 
before. News began to come of fighting between 
the police and the strikers when the roads tried to 
move their cars with men imported from Philadelphia, 
and then Fulkerson rejoiced at the splendid courage 
of the police. At the same time he believed what 
the strikers said, and that the trouble was not made 
by them, but by gangs of roughs acting without 
their approval. In this juncture he was relieved 
by the arrival of the State Board of Arbitratioi:, 
which took up its quarters, with a great many scare- 
heads, at one of the principal hotels, and invited the 
roads and the strikers to lay the matter in dispute 
before them ; he said that now we should see the 
working of the greatest piece of social machinery in 
modern times. But it appeared to work only in the 
alacrity of the strikers to submit their grievance. 
The roads were as one road in declaring that there 
was nothing to arbitrate, and that they were merely 
asserting their right to manage their own affairs in 
their own way. One of the presidents was reported 
to have told a member of the Board, who personally 
summoned him, to get out and to go about his 
business. Then, to Fulkerson's extreme disap])oint- 
ment, the august tribunal, acthig on behalf of the 



  

sovereign people in the interest of peace, declared 
itself powerless and got out, and would, no doubt, 
have gone about its business if it liad had any. 
Fulkerson did not know what to say, perhaps 
because the extras did not ; but March laughed at 
this result. 

" It 's a good deal like the military manoeuvre of 
the King of France and his forty thousand men. I 
suppose somebody told him at the top of the hill 
that there was nothing to arbitrate, and to get out 
and go about his business, and that was the reason 
he marched down after he had marched up with all 
that ceremony. What amuses me is to find that in 
an affair of this kind the roads have rights and the 
stvikers have rights, but the public has no rights at 
all. The roads and the strikers are allowed to fight 
out a private war in our midst — as thoroughly and 
precisely a private war as any we despise the Middle 
Ages for having tolerated — as any street war in 
Florence or Verona — and to fight it out at our pains 
and expense, and we stand by like sheep, and wait 
till we get tired. It 's a funny attitude for a city of 
fifteen hundred thousand inhabitants." 

" what would you do ? " asked Fulkerson, a good 
deal daunted by this view of the case. 

"Do? Nothing. Hasn't the State Board of 
Arbitration declared itself powerless ? We have no 
hold upon the strikers ; and we 're so used to being 
snubbed and disobliged by common carriers that we 
have forgotten our hold on the roads, and always 
allow them to manage their own affairs in their own 



  

way, quite as if we liad nothing to do with them, and 
they owed us no services in return for their privi- 
leges." 

"That 's a good deal so," said Fulkerson, disordering 
his hair. " Well, it 's nuts for the colonel nowadays. 
He says if he was boss of this town he would seize 
the roads on behalf of the people, and man 'cm with 
policemen, and run 'em till the managers had come 
to terms with the strikers ; and he 'd do that every 
time there was a strike." 

" Doesn't that rather savour of the paternalism he 
condemned in Lindau ? " asked March. 

"I don't know. It savours of horse-sense." 

" You are pretty far gone, Fulkerson. I thought 
you were the most engaged man I ever saw ; but I 
guess you're more father-in-lawed. And before 
you 're married too." 

" Well, the colonel 's a glorious old fellow, March. 
I wish he had the power to do that thing, just for 
the fun of looking on while he waltzed in. He 's on 
the keen jump from morning till night, and he's up 
late and early to see the row. I 'm afraid he 'll get 
shot at some of the fights ; he sees them all ; I can't 
get any show at them : haven't seen a brickbat 
shied or a club swung yet. Have you ? " 

"No, I find I can philosophise the situation about 
as well from the papers, and that's what I really 
want to do, I suppose. Besides I 'm solemnly 
pledged by Mrs. March not to go near any sort of 
crowd, under penalty of having her bring the children 
and go with me. Her theory is that we must all die 



  

together ; the children haven't been at school since 
the strike began. There 's no precaution that Mrs. 
March hasn't used. She watches me whenever I go 
out, and sees that I start straight for this office." 

Fulkerson laughed and said : "well, it's probably 
the only thing that 's saved your life. Have you 
seen anything of Beaton lately ? " 

" No. You don't mean to say he 's killed ! " 

"Not if he knows it. But I don't know . 

What do you say, March ? what 's the reason 
you couldn't get us up a paper on the strike ? ' 

"I know it would fetch round to Every Other 
Week, somehow." 

"No, but seriously. There'll be plenty of news- 
paper accounts. But you could treat it in the 
historical spirit — like something that happened 
several centuries ago ; De Foe's Plague of London 
style. Heigh ] What made me think of it was 
Beaton. If I could get hold of him, you two could 
go round together and take down its esthetic 
aspects. It 's a big thing, March, this strike is. I 
tell you it 's imposing to have a private war, as you 
say, fought out this way, in the heart of New York, 
and New York not minding it a bit. See ? Might 
take that view of it. With your descriptions and 
Beaton's sketches — well, it would just be the 
greatest card ! Come ! What do you say ? " 

" Will you undertake to make it right with Mrs. 
March if I 'm killed and she and the children are 
not killed with me ? " 

"Well, it would be difficult. I wonder how 



  

it would do to get Kendricks to do the literary 
part ? " 

" I 've no doubt he 'd jump at the chance. I 've 
yet to sec the form of literature that Kendricks 
 wouldn't lay down his life for." 

" Say ! " March perceived that Fulkerson was 
about to vent another inspiration, and smiled 
patiently. " Look here ! What 's the reason we 
couldn't get one of the strikers to write it u) 
for us?" 

" Might have a symposium of strikers and i)resi- 
dents," March suggested. 

" No ; I 'm in earnest. They say some of those 
fellows — especially the foreigners — are educated 
men. I know one fellow — a Bohemian — tliat used 
to edit a Bohemian newspaper here. He could 
write it out in his kind of Dutch, and we could get 
Lindau to translate it." 

"I guess not," said March dryly. 

" Why not ? He 'd do it for the cause, wouldn't 
he ? Suppose you put it up on him, the next time 
you see him." 

"I don't see- Lindau any more," said larch. He 
added, "I guess he 's renounced me along with Mr. 
Pryfoos's money." 

" Pshaw ! You don't mean he hasn't been round 
since ? " 

" He came for a while, but he 's left off coming now. 
I don't feci particularly gay about it," March said, 
with some resentment of Fulkerson's grin. " He 's 
left me in debt to him for lessons to the children." 



  

Fulkcrson laughed out. " Well, he is the greatest 
old fool ! Who 'd 'a' thought he 'd 'a' been in earnest 
with those ' brincibles ' of his ? But I suppose there 
have to be just such cranks ; it takes all kinds to 
make a world." 

" There has to be one such crank, it seems," IMarcli 
partially assented. " One 's enough for me." 

" I reckon this thing is nuts for Lindau, too," said 
Fulkerson. " Why, it must act like a schooner of 
beer on him all the while, to see ' gabidal ' embar- 
rassed like it is by this strike. It must make old 
Lindau feel like he was back behind those barricades 
at Berlin. Well, he 's a splendid old fellow ; pity
