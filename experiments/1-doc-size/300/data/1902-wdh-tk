tween herself and Boyne, which Boyne put down 



 

with mounting rage. The agriculture which tri 
umphed everywhere on the little half - acre plots 
lifted fifteen inches above the waters of the en 
vironing ditches, and the black and white cattle 
everywhere attesting the immemorial Dutch ideal 
of a cow, were what at first occupied Kenton, and 
he was tardily won from them to the question of 
fighting over a country like that. It was a con 
cession to his wife 's impassioned interest in the 
overthrow of the Spaniards in a landscape which 
had evidently not changed since. She said it was 
hard to realize that Holland was not still a republic, 
and she was not very patient with Breckon 's defence 
of the monarchy on the ground that the young 
Queen was a very pretty girl. 

" And she is only sixteen," Boyne urged. 

" Then she is two years too old for you," said 
Lottie. 

" No such thing!" Boyne retorted. " I was fifteen 
in June." 

" Dear me ! I should never have thought it," said 
his sister. 

Ellen seemed hardly to look out of the window 
at anything directly, but when her father bade her 
see this thing and that, it seemed that she had 
seen it already. She said at last, with a quiet sigh, 
" I never want to go away." 

She had been a little shy of Breckon the whole 
morning, and had kept him asking himself whether 
she was sorry she had walked so long with him 
the night before, or, having offered him due rep- 



 

aration for her family, she was again dropping him. 
Now and then he put her to the test by words ex 
plicitly directed at her, and she replied with the 
dreamy passivity which seemed her normal mood, 
and in which he could fancy himself half forgotten, 
or remembered with an effort. 

In the midst of this doubt she surprised him he 
reflected that she was always surprising him by 
asking him how far it was from The Hague to the 
sea. He explained that The Hague was in the sea 
like all the rest of Holland, but that if she meant 
the shore, it was no distance at all. Then she said, 
vaguely, she wished they were going to the shore. 
Her father asked Breckon if there was not a hotel 
at the beach, and the young man tried to give him 
a notion of the splendors of the Kurhaus at Scheven- 
ingen; of Scheveningen itself he despaired of giv 
ing any just notion. 

" Then we can go there," said the judge, ignor 
ing Ellen, in his decision, as if she had nothing to 
do with it. 

Lottie interposed a vivid preference for The 
Hague. She had, she said, had enough of the sea 
for one while, and did not want to look at it again 
till they sailed for home. Boyne turned to his father 
as if a good deal shaken by this reasoning, and it 
was Mrs. Kenton who carried the day for going first 
to a hotel in The Hague and prospecting from there 
in the direction of Scheveningen; Boyne and his 
father could go down to the shore and see which 
they liked best. 



 

" I don 't see what that has to do with me," said 
Lottie. No one was alarmed by her announce 
ment that if she did not like Scheveningen she 
should stay at The Hague, whatever the rest did; 
in the event fortune favored her going with her 
family. 

The hotel in The Hague was very pleasant, with 
a garden behind it, where a companionable cat 
had found a dry spot, and where Lottie found the 
cat and made friends with it. But she said the 
hotel was full of Cook 's tourists, whom she recog 
nized, in spite of her lifelong ignorance of them, by 
a prescience derived from the conversation of Mr. 
Pogis, and from the instinct of a society woman, 
already rife in her. She found that she could not 
stay in a hotel with Cook 's tourists, and she took 
her father 's place in the exploring party which 
went down to the watering-place in the afternoon, 
on the top of a tram-car, under the leafy roof of 
the adorable avenue of trees which embowers the 
track to Scheveningen. She disputed Boyne 's im 
pressions of the Dutch people, whom he found look 
ing more like Americans than any foreigners he had 
seen, and she snubbed Breckon from his supposed 
charge of the party. But after the start, when she 
declared that Ellen could not go, and that it was 
ridiculous for her to think of it, she was very good 
to her, and looked after her safety and comfort with 
a despotic devotion. 

At the Kurhaus she promptly took the lead in 
choosing rooms, for she had no doubt of staying 



 

there after the first glance at the place, and she 
showed a practical sense in settling her family, 
which at least her mother appreciated when they 
were installed the next day. 

Mrs. Kenton could not make her husband admire 
Lottie 's faculty so readily. " You think it would 
have been better for her to sit down with Ellen 
on the sand and dream of the sea," she reproached 
him, with a tender resentment on behalf of Lottie. 
" Everybody can 't dream." 

" Yes, but I wish she didn 't keep awake with such 
a din," said the judge. After all, he admired Lot 
tie 's judgment about the rooms, and he censured 
her with a sigh of relief from care as he sank back 
in the easy-chair fronting the window that looked 
out on the North Sea ; Lottie had already made him 
appreciate the view till he was almost sick of it. 

" What is the matter ?" said Mrs. Kenton, sharp 
ly. " Do you want to be in Tuskingum ? I suppose 
you would rather be looking into Kichard 's back 
yard." 

"No," said the judge, mildly, "this is very 
nice." 

"It will do Ellen good, every minute. I don 't 
care how much she sits on the sands and dreams. 
I 'll love to see her." 

The sitting on the sand was a survival of Mrs. 
Kenton 's preoccupations of the sea-side. As a mat 
ter of fact, Ellen was at that moment sitting in one 
of the hooded wicker arm-chairs which were scatter 
ed over the whole vast beach like a growth of mon- 



 

strous mushrooms, and, confronting her in cosey 
proximity, Breckon sat equally hidden in another 
windstuhl. Her father and her mother were able 
to keep them placed, among the multitude of wind- 
stuhls, by the presence of Lottie, who hovered near 
them, and, with Boyne, fended off the demure, 
wicked - looking little Scheveningen girls. On a 
smaller scale these were exactly like their demure, 
wicked - looking Scheveningen mothers, and they 
approached with knitting in their hands, and with 
large stones folded in their aprons, which they had 
pilfered from the mole, and were trying to sell 
for footstools. The windstuhl men and they were 
enemies, and when Breckon bribed them to go away, 
the windstuhl men chased them, and the little girls 
ran, making mouths at Boyne over their shoulders. 
He scorned to notice them ; but he was obliged to 
report the misconduct of Lottie, who began mak 
ing eyes at the Dutch officers as soon as she could 
feel that Ellen was safely off her hands. She was 
the more exasperating and the more culpable to 
Boyne, because she had asked him to walk up the 
beach with her, and had then made the fraternal 
promenade a basis of operations against the Dutch 
military. She joined her parents in ignoring Boyne 's 
complaints, and continued to take credit for all 
the pleasant facts of the situation; she patron 
ized her family as much for the table d hote at 
luncheon as for the comfort of their rooms. She 
was able to assure them that there was not a Cook 's 
tourist in the hotel, where there seemed to be nearly 



 

every other kind of fellow-creature. At the end 
of the first week she had acquaintance of as many 
nationalities as she could reach in their native or 
acquired English, in all the stages of haughty toler 
ation, vivid intimacy, and cold exhaustion. She 
had a faculty for getting through with people, or of 
ceasing to have any use for them, which was perhaps 
her best safeguard in her adventurous flirting ; while 
the simple aliens were still in the full tide of fan 
cied success, Lottie was sick of them all, and deep 
in an indiscriminate correspondence with her young 
men in Tuskingum. 

The letters which she had invited from these 
while still in New York arrived with the first of 
those readdressed from the judge 's London banker. 
She had more letters than all the rest of the family 
together, and counted a half-dozen against a poor 
two for her sister. Mrs. Kenton cared nothing about 
Lottie 's letters, but she was silently uneasy about 
the two that Ellen carelessly took. She wondered 
who could be writing to Ellen, especially in a cover 
bearing a handwriting altogether strange to her. 

"It isn 't from Bittridge, at any rate," she said 
to her husband, in the speculation which she made 
him share. " I am always dreading to have her 
find out what Richard did. It would spoil every 
thing, I 'm afraid, and now everything is going so 
well. I do wish Richard hadn t, though, of course, 
he did it for the best. Who do you think has 
been writing to her ?" 

"Why don 't you ask her?" 



 

" I suppose she will tell me after a while. I don 't 
like to seem to be following her up. One was 
from Bessie Pearl, I think." 

Ellen did not speak of her letters to her mother, 
and after waiting a day or two, Mrs. Kenton could 
not refrain from asking her. 

" Oh, I forgot," said Ellen. " I haven 't read them 
yet." 

" Haven 't read them !" said Mrs. Kenton. Then, 
after reflection, she added, " You are a strange girl, 
Ellen," and did not venture to say more. 

"I suppose I thought I should have to answer 
them, and that made me careless. But I will read 
them." Her mother was silent, and presently Ellen 
added : " I hate to think of the past. Don 't you, 
momma ?" 

"It is certainly very pleasant here," said Mrs. 
Kenton, cautiously. "You 're enjoying yourself 
I mean, you seem to be getting so much stronger." 

" Why, momma, why do you talk as if I had been 
sick?" Ellen asked. 

" I mean you 're so much interested." 

"Don 't I go about everywhere, like anybody?" 
Ellen pursued, ignoring her explanation. 

"Yes, you certainly do. Mr. Breckon seems to 
like going about." 

Ellen did not respond to the suggestion except 
to say : " We go into all sorts of places. This morn 
ing we went up on that schooner that 's drawn up 
on the beach, and the old man who was there was 
very pleasant. I thought it was a wreck, but Mr. 



 

Breckon says they 're always drawing their ships 
that way up on the sand. The old man was patching 
some of the wood-work, and he told Mr. Breckon 
he can speak a little Dutch that they were going 
to drag her down to the water and go fishing as 
soon as he was done. He seemed to think we were 
brother and sister." She flushed a little, and then 
she said: "I believe I like the dunes as well as 
anything. Sometimes when those curious cold 
breaths come in from the sea we climb up in the 
little hollows on the other side and sit there out of 
the draft. Everybody seems to do it."
