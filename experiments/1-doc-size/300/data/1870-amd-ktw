lowed such a step ; but there are some poor people 
who would have run in debt for a fine dress, and have 


 


spent a miserable evening in trying to appear of 
much more consecpience than they really were. 
These usages of society are, in themselves, wise and 
proper, and it is only in the hands of selfish and 
underbred people that they are employed as a means 
of pain. You can see that Mr. and Mrs. Morrison 
would feel out of place in our social gatherings.” 

“ I believe I understand that ” ; and Katliie smiled 
readily, though the puzzled look was not all out of 
her face. 

" It is much wiser and kinder to render people 
happy in their own sphere than, from an ill-judged 
generosity, to take them out of it occasionally and 
then thrust them back.” 

“ But if we have a party, oughtn’t I to ask 'the 
poor girls as well as those wdio are rich ? ” 

“ Will you ask every one in school ? ” 

“ No ,” returned Katliie, after a pause ; “ there are 
some rude, rough girls that I never play with.” 

“ Your judgment will teach you whom to invite, I 
think ; and, Katliie, the great thing with all true men 
and women is a noble, useful life. This can only 
proceed from a generous, well-regulated soul. Kow 
when Mr. Meredith comes to look at our house we 


 


shall not expect him to examine the foundation- 
stones, the timber, the thickness of the walls, and 
inspect the quality of our wall-paper, — shall we ? ” 
“ Why, no ” ; and she laughed at the ridiculous 
idea. 

“ He will judge it altogether, and if it has a pleas- 
ant, harmonious effect, he will enjoy it. Just so it is 
with character. We never expect to tell people how 
bad our tempers were, and what hard work we had to 
make them better, — that we were very vain, and 
had striven against it, and the many faults that 
continually beset poor human nature ? And yet it is 
these small, unseen things that improve us, — this 
constant, daily work. If the painters had neglected 
one side of our house, or put on some other color, it 
would be very quickly remarked.” 

“ Indeed, it would ” ; and Kathie laughed. 

“ So glaring faults are very easily observed ; and, 
on the other hand, pretty, engaging manners are as 
much admired. You sometimes like people without 
being able to explain why, — do you not ? ” 

“ O yes ! — Miss Jessie for one.” 

“Miss Jessie is pleasant, refined, and possesses true 

appreciation. She never carries about with her an 


obtrusive sense of edu cation or dress. I am glad that 
you have chanced upon such a friend, although you 
are a little girl ; and she is one of the persons who 
look for something beside wealth and show. Am 
I preaching you too much of a sermon ? ” 

“ Oh no, I like to hear you talk,” Kathie said, 
simply. 

“ I will only add that if you had been a noisy, 
ill-mannered child, I should not have enjoyed taking 
you to New York, and I doubt if even the fortune 
would have gained you many admirers.” 

Kathie felt that this was true. It had not been 
simply because she was rich that Mrs. Havens and 
Mr. Meredith had taken such pains to entertain her. 
A child with less humility than Kathie might have 
felt secretly elated ; but as she gave Uncle Robert’s 
hand a fond squeeze she hoped inwardly that she 
would always be able to please and satisfy the friends 
who had been so kind. 

A few days after this Mr. Meredith made his ap- 
pearance at Brookside. He was delighted with the 
house and its surroundings, and most glad to see 
Kathie. But, joy of all, he had brought with him 
two elegant ponies that Uncle Robert had ordered, — - 


 


sleek and shining creatures with beautiful manes and 
great gentle-looking eyes. One had a white star in 
his forehead. 

“ For the present,” Uncle Robert said, “ one pony 
is to he Kathies and the other Rob’s. Kathie will 
be generous with hers, I know, and I want Rob to be 
manly and obliging. The first one who acts selfishly 
forfeits the pony.” 

“ Can I choose ? ” asked Rob, with his eyes full of 
anxiety, and a little tremor in his voice. 

“ You are the eldest,” said Kathie. 

“ Well, Rob, which is it then ?” 

Rob hesitated somewhat. He thought he ought to 

O O 

be generous, but it was very hard to give up his 
favorite, and perhaps Kathie didn’t really care. So 
he flushed and looked boyishly embarrassed. 

“ I think this one is the prettiest,” he said. “ I 
like this white mark, and if I had him I should call 
him Star.” 

“ Then you shall have him,” replied Kathie. 

“ You don’t want him ? ” asked Rob, slowly. 

" It will not make any difference to me, and the 
other looks the most gentle. What shall we call 
him, Mr. Meredith ? ” 


 


“ I believe this one is named Hero.” 

“ Oh, I like that, so I shall not change it.” 

Rob could hardly forbear giving his horse a raptur- 
ous hug. Just one more week of school, and then — 
hurrah ! ” 

“ Why, Rob ! ” exclaimed his uncle, surprised at 
the pirouette. 

“ I was thinking of something” ; and Rob ran away 
quite red in the face. 

On the next morning there came a pretty low 
pony-carriage and two saddles. 

“ It will be so delightful to take Aunt Ruth out,” 
Katliie exclaimed, joyously. “ Can I learn to 
drive ? ” 

“ I am at your service for the first lesson,” said Mr. 
Meredith. “ Will you ride or drive ? ” 

“ She will need a dress for riding,” announced 
mamma, “ and it will take a few days to get that 
ready.” 

Freddy shed some tears over the fact that his was 
n’t a real live pony. 

“ You are rather small to manage one,” said Uncle 
Robert, soothingly, “ but one of these days you ’ll 
grow as large as Rob.” 


 


That was quite comforting. 

Katliie was a little timid, it must be confessed. 
The horses were very gentle creatines and well 
trained, and Mr. Meredith was the most patient of 
instructors. 

On the way they passed Lottie Thorne, who had 
gone of an errand, and so was not in school. 

“ I suppose Kathie Alston feels very grand,” she 
said, in an envious tone, as she was telling the in- 
cident. “ A handsome young gentleman too, that 
I never saw before. Girls, she will outshine us 
all ! ” 

“ Oh, it ’s her pony,” exclaimed Mary Cox. “ Bob 
told us all about it ; they each have one.” 

“ It ’s so charming to put on airs when people have 
been poor as — as — ” But Lottie hardly dared make 
the comparison in her mind.” 

“ Kathie never did put on airs, and will not now,” 
Mary declared, brave little champion that she was. 
“ I ’m sure that I ’d rather Kathie Alston would have 
a fortune than any other girl in the world.” 

Poor Lottie was forced to keep silence, but she 
made herself very miserable over the ponies. Her 
father kept two horses, but he would as soon think of 



sending Her up in a balloon as allowing her to try to 
drive. 

Eob liad his indulgence in the afternoon. He had 
ridden more than one old nag bareback, and so he 
quite plumed himself upon his skill. 

They began to plan about their party, and had 
great fun in choosing a name for the new house. 
Eob’s taste ran to the extravagant. Finally the con- 
test was narrowed to two, — Silver Lake Cottage and 
Cedarwood. At the north stood a beautiful grove of 
cedars, which made the latter very appropriate. 

Kathie proposed that they should go and call upon 
Miss Jessie and ask her opinion. Mr. Meredith was 
quite charmed with the young lady, and the sweet 
old grandmother also. 

Miss Jessie declared in favor of Cedarwood. She 
and Mr. Meredith had a gay chat and a walk through 
the garden, greatly to Kathie’s delight, for she was an 
ardent admirer of both. 

After that they were much taken up with prepara- 
tions for the party. Eob’s vacation came at last
and he could hardly contain himself. Mrs. Alston 
felt sometimes as if lie was getting quite beyond her 
jurisdiction, and he had always been rather boisterous 
and headstrong. 


 


“ We will take him in hand presently,’ said his 
uncle. “ Through the winter I shall have more time 
to devote to him, and then part of the excitement will 
have subsided. He has the foundation for a fine inan 
in him, I think.” 

" But I sometimes feel like Katliie, that we give 
you a great deal of trouble and can do but little for 
you,” she said with a sad, sweet smile. 

“ And I am glad to take the trouble. The old 
selfish, ease-loving years of my life have passed for- 
ever. In God’s good providence I have become useful 
at last.” 

The lawn and shrubbery were to be decorated with 
colored lanterns, although there would be a moon. A 
band of music was engaged, and there was to be a 
bountiful supper with an abundance of ices. They 
had a great time making out lists of invitations. 
Kathie’s generous heart would have taken in nearly 
all Brookside. 

She thought, when the evening arrived, that she 
had never dreamed of anything so beautiful. But 
when she came down stairs dressed in simplest white 
Bob felt immensely disappointed. 

“ I ’d have put on the very handsomest thing I 


 


had,” he said, decisively. “ I ’d show Lottie Thorne 
and some of the rest what I could do.” 

“No, Kathie is just right,” said Mr. Meredith. 
“ There is nothing in the world as attractive as a 
sweet face and a simple, unselfish heart.” 

It was a splendid night, and the guests soon began 
to arrive. Troops of girls and boys, and not a few 
older people, for there was a very general feeling in
