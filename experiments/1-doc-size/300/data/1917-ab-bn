you should come in* She's got somethin' to say to you." 

Instantly Ellen knew what it was, and she had a pang 
of pain for Ardelia who dared not tell her alone. 

" Yes," she said, in a small voice. " I'll come in. Let, 
me wipe my hands." 

So Peleg left her and she stood holding the towel, as it 
hung, and then put one hand to her heart and whispered : 
" My God ! my God ! " and then it seemed to her it was 
not a large enough matter to cry to God about — God 
who was busy with Belgium! — and she crossed the hall 
after Peleg and went into the room behind him. Peleg 
was knocking out his pipe at the fireplace, and for the 
first time in her knowledge of him he looked serious. 



 

Ardelia was flushed, her hair disordered on one side where 
Peleg had pressed her head to him in a reassuring caress 
as he had gone for Ellen. She had cried a tear or two, 
yet she looked gayly happy. Ellen stayed near the 
door, her hand on the back of a chair, and Feleg, glancing 
at her, was sorry for her. He thought she looked 
frightened. 

" Well, little girl," said he, " your mother's got some- 
thin' to tell you. Now speak your piece, Delia." 

Here he did laugh a little, but Ardelia could not speak. 
She only looked at Ellen and seemed to be praying to her. 

" Well," said Peleg, " I guess it's got to come on me. 
Ellie, how'd you like to have a new father? " 

Ellen was silent for a moment, remembering Grissie and 
the day she had said the same thing. And now Peleg had 
said it, and she didn't want to strike him as she had 
wanted to strike Grissie : only she knew he must never say 
it again. 

" You mustn't," said she, in a low tone, " say anything 
to me about my father." 

Ardelia whimpered a little and Peleg threw her a sooth- 
ing " There ! there ! " before he turned again to Ellen. 

" 'Course," said he, " I hadn't ought to said that." 

" You mustn't," said Ellen, " ever. Nobody must." 

She meant Ardelia, and Ardelia, understanding, whim- 
pered again. 

" Well," said Peleg, with a fictitious jollity, for after 
all Ellen did make him cold along the spine, " what should 
you say to comin' to live with me, to Bromley Wells? " 

" You mean," said Ellen, " you're going to marry my 
mother. I know that. Now we needn't talk about it." 

" O Ellen," said Ardelia, " don't you want to say any- 
thing? Don't you hope 'twill be a good thing for me? 
An' you, too, Ellie. I want it to be a good thing for you." 



 

Ellen, looking at the faded coquette waiting only the 
smallest excuse to be again a bacchante, hated herself for 
her own rigidity. She wanted to go to Ardelia and throw 
her arms about her in the spirit Ardelia longed for, and 
wish her joy in the words that are for brides. Ardelia 
could have accepted it all in a rapture of excitement. 
But Ellen was bound as inexorably within the high hedge 
of her temperament as Ardelia in the disordered house of 
light affection, and she looked miserably at her mother 
and said nothing. 

" Now,'' said Peleg, with a grand flourish of voice, 
" somethin's comin' out o' this for you. What do you 
s'pose your mother's done? She's had this house an' land 
made over to you." 

" Yes, Ellie," said Ardelia appealingly, " for your use 
an' behoof. It ain't as if you wa'n't comin' to live with 
us. You be. But I know how you set by this place 
same's your father did — there ! there ! I never meant to 
say that. An' 'twa'n't my thought either. 'Twas Peleg's, 
An' there were things to do, settlin' the estate — I didn't 
know 'twas big enough to be an estate — an' whatever was 
mine in it I've made over to you. He done it though." 

She turned to Feleg fondly, and Ellen, glancing at him 
in a misery that tried to trick itself out as gratitude, had 
the justice to see that he was not pluming himself on his 
large-mindedness but taking the stand of a sober de- 
cency. 

" So," said he, " you'll have your home with us, but 
you'll always feel you've got one o' your own. An' when 
you marry, you can bring your man here 'f you want to." 

Now he did cackle, but Ellen did not hate him. She 
saw how exceedingly well he meant, and instead she scorned 
herself because she could not meet him generously. Yet 
there was a timidity too in her withdrawal: if you met 



Peleg unreservedly where would he be? She did answer, 
and very much like a child, in the country phrasing: 

" You're real good, both of you. I can't take it, 
mother. But you're real good." 

" 'Course you'll take it," said Ardelia, holding her head 
high in the grandeur of having so much to give. " Ain't 
I goin' to have a house o' my own? An' that's as much 
yours as 'tis mine. He says so." 

"There! there!" said Peleg. He had talked enough 
about his own munificence and he didn't like the look on 
Ellen's face. "Now I'm goin' out to harness up an' 
we'll all take a ride." 

Ardelia got his coat and Ellen slipped away into the 
pantry and held her hands against her ears. She had a 
wounding certainty that the foolish bacchante would be 
kissed after the coat was on, and with it an equal certainty 
— and this was terrifying — that Peleg's kisses would be 
loud enough to pursue her through the walls between them. 
So she stood there, shutting her ears against him, until 
she dared take down her hands ; then presently she heard 
her mother calling and telling her to hurry, and she found 
Ardelia in the entry with her outdoor things on. And 
she had left off her mourning veil. 

"You ain't got on your things," said Ardelia. 
" Come, you hurry. His horse don't like to stand." 

" I can't go," said Ellen. She opened the door, and in 
the haste of her passion seemed to be sweeping her mother 
out. " I want to study." 

Ardelia, she saw, was not sorry. Who could really 
want a daughter who behaved, as Larry said, like a little 
devil? But Ardelia turned back again. 

" P'you s'pose," she said, " I shall get cold 'thout my 
veil?" 

" No," said Ellen violently, " no. Good-by." 



 

This last was to Feleg, who was nodding jovially. 
" You needn't have Larry Greene on your mind," her 
mother stopped to call. " I run down there 'fore break- 
fast, an' his flag was up." 

Ellen shut the door and went into her mother's bedroom. 
Ardelia's open bandbox was on a chair. The cover lay 
on the floor, and Ellen knew the haste for pleasure that 
had overthrown Ardelia's ordered ways. There at the 
bottom of the box lay the folded mourning veil. Ardelia, 
in the first months of her grief, had taken a dismal 
pleasure in the veil. It had cost too much; but she had 
felt with Ellen that it was a necessity of the tragic time. 
Now Ellen took it out in unflinching resolution and folded 
it more tightly. She went back into the sitting-room 
where the fire was smoldering — it was the last glowing 
state of a great apple tree knot she and her mother had 
been keeping for some fine occasion — and laid it on the 
coals. And though Ardelia that night broke out in won- 
der over the loss of her veil, Ellen did not answer and 
Ardelia, trembling, said no more. Sometimes she was a 
little afraid of Ellen. 

Now Ellen took down her coat and hat and went out 
and down the lane to Larry's. She felt quiet and sober 
about her mission : for at last she was to disobey the flag 
and walk into the house where Larry, if he were ill, needed 
her more than when he was well. Smilie came bounding 
and twisting to meet her, and she knew Larry must have 
been up that morning to let her out. She tapped at the 
door, a little sick within her, because she could not guess 
what she should find; and then, when he did not answer, 
she opened the door and walked in. But for some reason 
she shut Smilie out. She had a foolish feeling that Smilie 
must not know. The room smelled horrible to her, of 
stale air and liquor. There was no fire and Larry lay on 



 

the sofa, breathing heavily. She threw the blanket rug 
over him, built up the fire and set the kettle on to boil. 
Then she found some bread and meat for Smilie, and put 
it out on the step, and sat down by Larry and looked at 
him. Could she bear to see him in his overthrow, if she 
had married him? She wondered, and decided that she 
could. The passion of woman's inborn sacrifice came 
upon her, the nature-implanted and most tragic desire to 
champion lost causes. It was the neighborhood atti- 
tude, she knew, to consider him sinful and degraded. But 
she thought him still Larry, though strangely changed. 
And after the kettle had boiled and she had put it back 
and had sat perhaps an hour more by the fire, he woke and 
saw her brooding there. It seemed a long time before 
right knowledge came to him of what the vision really 
was, because he had never before risen from his abyss to 
find a human creature. But now, as he came more and 
more to himself, he saw that this was no part of a dream, 
as it had been before, but Ellen who had broken through 
the invisible walls. As he sat up and put his hands to 
his face to shut her out — and it looked as if he raised 
them most pathetically to eyes that must be weeping be- 
hind them — he said to himself: "Horrible! oh, hor- 
rible ! " 

"I'll make some tea," said Ellen. 

She brought it to him, and he drank it without looking 
at her. The wonder in his mind was that a creature who 
kept poor Ardelia in a state of nervous overthrow could 
yet stand here beside him warmly maternal and as strong 
as dawn. When he had given the cup back to her, he 
said: 

" Now go home, child. And never come here again, 
never alone. Better, never at all." 



I am going to get your dinner," said Ellen. "We 
had chicken, and I brought you some." 

He did not forbid her, but went off to his room and 
bathed and came down decent, and he ate what she set out 
for him, and Smilie was let in and joyously curled herself 
up on her lounge and slept without even a blinking eye. 
She had abandoned anxiety until the next mysterious up- 
heaval. 

" He came," said Ellen, &ially. " And I was good." 

Larry could not talk to her. He looked at her when 
she was not looking and adored her with his eyes. She 
told him more about Feleg, and, though it was hard to do 
that, about her mother's giving her the place. That 
roused him and they talked, quite in their old way, of her 
taking it. He thought she should take it, and it was 
plain she wanted to, plain she was going to love it in place 
of her mother who was not quite her mother now, with 
kind, hated Feleg between them. And when she had 
cleared away the dinner and brushed up the hearth, Larry 
said: 

" Now run home. And I'll come to see you. But don't 
come here again." 

Ellen put on her coat, and then went to him and like 
a child put up her face to be kissed. It was the divine- 
ness of her belief in him, whether he was in his abyss or 
out of it, that shook him now. He saw she was saying, 
" You are the same Larry, and I am your Ellen." But 
he did not kiss her. 

" I couldn't be quite such a blackguard, dear," he said. 
"Now run. And Ellen" — she had turned away, not 
hurt but taking him on faith, and sure he had xmderstood 
what she meant as well without the kiss — " just take down 
that flag, will you? And carry it home with you." 



 

" What shall I do with it? " Ellen began ; but the look 
on his face, the desperate brightness of it, told her a part, 
at least, of what he meant* 

" Cut along," said he, " and ask your mother to come in 
the morning and neat me up." 

She went, with a little nod at him ; and he stood listen- 
ing until he heard the click of her pulling down the flag. 
Then he went to the window and looked after her. She 
was going along the path, the flag above her shoulder, 
upright and fluttering. It looked triumphant. Larry 
drew a great breath. His eyes were hot and hurt him. 
He went over to Smilie and flapped one of her ears to call
