variation. His father was dead and his lonne was dismissed, 
but the young man still conformed to the spirit of their teaching 
  he never went to the edge of the lake. There was still 
something agreeable to the nostril about him, and something 
not offensive to nobler organs. He was a very gentle and 
gracious youth, with what are called cultivated tastes an 
acquaintance with old china, with good wine, with the bindings 
of books, with the Almanack de Gotha, with the best shops, 
the best hotels, the hours of railway-trains. He could order a 
dinner almost as well as Mr. Luce, and it was probable that as 
his experience accumulated he would be a worthy successor to 
that gentleman, whose rather grim politics he also advocated, in 
a soft and innocent voice. He had some charming rooms in 
Paris, decorated with old Spanish altar-lace, the envy of his 
female friends, who declared that his chimney-piece was better 
draped than many a duchess. He usually, however, spent a 
part of every winter at Pau, and had once passed a couple of 
months in the United States. 

He took a great interest in Isabel, and remembered perfectly 
the walk at Neufchatel, when she would persist in going so near 
the edge. He seemed to recognise this same tendency in the 
subversive inquiry that I quoted a moment ago, and set himself 
to answer our heroine's question with greater urbanity than it 
perhaps deserved. " What does it lead to, Miss Archer ? Why 
Paris leads everywhere. You can't go anywhere unless you 
come here first. Every one that comes to Europe has got to 
pass through. You don't mean it in that sense so much? You 
mean what good it does you? Well, how can you penetrate 
futurity ? How can you tell what lies ahead ? If it's a pleasant 
road I don't care where it leads. I like the road, Miss Archer ; 
I like the dear old asphalte. You can't get tired of it you 
can't if you try. You think you would, but you wouldn't; 
there's always something new and fresh. Take the Hotel 
Drouot, now ; they sometimes have three and four sales a week. 
Where can you get such things as you can here? In spite of 
all they say, I maintain they are cheaper too, if you know the 
tight places. I know plenty of places, but I keep them to 
myself. I'll tell you, if you like, as a particular favour ; only 



 

you must not tell any one else. Don't you go anywhere with- 
out asking me first; I want you to promise me that. As a 
general thing avoid the Boulevards ; there is very little to be 
done on the Boulevards. Speaking conscientiously sans blague 
I don't believe any one knows Paris better than I. You and 
Mrs. Touchett must come and breakfast with me some day, and 
I'll show you rny things ; je ne vous dis que $a ! There has 
been a great deal of talk about London of late ; it's the fashion 
to cry up London. But there is nothing in it you can't dp 
anything in London. No Louis Quinze nothing of the First 
Empire ; nothing but their eternal Queen Anne. It's good for 
one's bed-room, Queen Anne for one's washing-room ; but it 
isn't proper for a salon. Do I spend my life at the auctioneer's ? " 
Mr. Hosier pursued, in answer to another question of Isabel's. 
" Oh, no ; I haven't the means. I wish I had. You think I'm 
a mere trifler; I can tell by the expression of your face you 
have got a wonderfully expressive face. I hope you don't mind 
my saying that ; I mean it as a kind of warning. You think I 
ought to do something, and so do I, so long as you leave it 
vague. But when you come to the point, you see you have to 
stop. I can't go home and be a shopkeeper. You think I am 
very well fitted? Ah, Miss Archer, you overrate me. I can 
buy very well, but I can't sell ; you should see when I some- 
times try to get rid of my things. It takes much more ability 
to make other people buy than to buy yourself. When I think 
how clever they must be, the people who make me buy ! Ah, 
no; I couldn't be a shopkeeper. I can't be a doctor, it's a 
repulsive business. I can't be a clergyman, I haven't got con- 
victions. And then I can't pronounce the names right in the 
Bible. They are very difficult, in the Old Testament particularly. 
I can't be a lawyer ; I don't understand how do you call it 
the American procedure. Is there anything else? There 
is nothing for a gentleman to do in America. I should like 
to be a diplomatist; but American diplomacy that is not 
for gentlemen either. I am sure if you had seen the last 

min " 

Henrietta Stackpole, who was often with her friend when Mr. 
Rosier, coming to pay his compliments, late in the afternoon, 
expressed himself after the fashion I have sketched, usually 
interrupted the young man at this point and read him a lecture 
on the duties of the American citizen. She thought him most 
unnatural ; he was worse than Mr. Ralph Touchett. Henrietta, 
however, was at this time more than ever addicted to fine 
criticism, for her conscience had been freshly alarmed as regards 



 

Isabel. She had not congratulated this young lady on her 
accession of fortune, and begged to be excused from doing so. 

" If Mr. Touchett had consulted me about leaving you the 
money," she frankly said, " I would have said to him, 
'Never!'" 

"I see," Isabel had answered. "You think it will prove a 
curse in disguise. Perhaps it will." 

" Leave it to some one you care less for that's what I should 
have said." 

" To yourself, for instance ? " Isabel suggested, jocosely. And 
then " Do you really believe it will ruin me ? " she asked, in 
quite another tone. 

" I hope it won't ruin you ; but it will certainly confirm your 
dangerous tendencies." 

" Do you mean the love of luxury of extravagance ? " 

" No, no," said Henrietta ; " I mean your moral tendencies. 
I approve of luxury ; I think we ought to be as elegant as 
possible. Look at the luxury of our western cities ; I have 
seen nothing over here to compare with it. I hope you will 
never become sensual ; but I am not afraid of that. The peril 
for you is that you live too much in the world of your own 
dreams you are not enough in contact with reality with the 
toiling, striving, suffering, I may even say sinning, world that 
surrounds you. You are too fastidious ; you have too many 
graceful illusions. Your newly-acquired thousands will shut 
you up more and more to the society of a few selfish and heart- 
less people, who will be interested in keeping up those illusions." 

Isabel's eyes expanded as she gazed upon this vivid but dusky 
picture of her future. "What are my illusions? " she asked. 
" I try so hard not to have any." 

" Well," said Henrietta, tl you think that you can lead a 
romantic life, that you can live by pleasing yourself and pleasing 
others. You will find you are mistaken. Whatever life you 
lead, you must put your soul into it to make any sort of success 
of it ; and from the moment you do that it ceases to be romance, 
I assure you ; it becomes reality ! And you can't always please 
yourself; you must sometimes please other people. That, I 
admit, you are very ready to do; but there is another thing 
that is still more important you must often displease others. 
You must always be ready for that you must never shrink 
fi-oni it. That doesn't suit you at all you are too fond of 
admiration, you like to be thought well of. You think we can 
escape disagreeable duties by taking romantic views that is 
your great illusion, my dear. But we can't. You must be 



 

prepared on many occasions in life to please no one at all not 
even yourself." 

Isabel shook her head sadly ; she looked troubled and 
frightened. " This, for you, Henrietta," she said, " must be 
one of those occasions ! " 

It was certainly true that Miss Stackpole, during her visit to 
Paris, which had been professionally more remunerative than 
her English sojourn, had not been living in the world of 
dreams. Mr. Bantling, who had now returned to England, was 
her companion for the first four weeks of her stay ; and about 
Mr. Bantling there was nothing dreamy. Isabel learned from 
her friend that the two liad-led a life of great intimacy, and 
that this had been a peculiar advantage to Henrietta, owing 
to the gentleman's remarkable knowledge of Paris. He had 
explained everything, shown her everything, been her constant 
guide and interpreter. They had breakfasted together, dined 
together, gone to the theatre together, supped together, really in 
a manner quite lived together. He was a true friend, Henrietta 
more than once assured our heroine ; and she had never 
supposed that she could like any Englishman so well. Isabel 
could not have told you why, but she found something that 
ministered to mirth in the alliance the correspondent of the 
Interviewer had struck with Lady Pensil's brother ; and her 
amusement subsisted in the face of the fact that she thought 
it a credit to each of them. Isabel could not rid herself .of a 
suspicion that they were playing, somehow, at cross-purposes 
that the simplicity of each of them, had been entrapped. But 
this simplicity was none the less honourable on either side ; it 
was as graceful on Henrietta's part to believe that Mr. Bantling 
took an interest in the diffusion of lively journalism, and in 
consolidating the position of lady-correspondents, as it was on 
the part of her companion to suppose that the cause of the 
Interviewer a periodical of which he never formed a very 
definite conception was, if subtly analysed (a task to which 
Mr. Bantling felt himself quite equal), but the cause of Miss 
Stackpole's coquetry. Each of these harmless confederates 
supplied at any rate a want of which the other was somewhat 
eagerly conscious. Mr. Bantling, who was of a rather slow and 
discursive habit, relished a prompt, keen, positive woman, who 
charmed him with the spectacle of a brilliant eye and a kind of 
bandbox neatness, and who kindled a perception of raciness in a 
mind to which the usual fare of life seemed unsalted. Henrietta, 
on the other hand, enjoyed the society of a fresh-looking, 
professionless gentleman, whose leisured state, though generally 



 

indefensible, was a decided advantage to Miss Stackpole, and 
who was furnished with an easy, traditional, though by no 
means exhaustive, answer to almost any social or practical 
question that could come up. She often found Mr. Bantling's 
answers very convenient, and in the press of catching the 
American post would make use of them in her correspondence. 
It was to be feared that she was indeed drifting toward those 
mysterious shallows as to which Isabel, wishing for a good- 
humoured retort, had warned her. There might be danger in 
store for Isabel ; but it was scarcely to be hoped that Miss 
Stackpole, on her side, would find permanent safety in the 
adoption of second-hand views. Isabel continued to warn her, 
good-humouredly ; Lady Pensil's obliging brother was some- 
times, on our heroine's lips, an object of irreverent and facetious 
allusion. Nothing, however, could exceed Henrietta's amiability 
on this point ; she used to abound in the sense of Isabel's irony, 
and to enumerate with elation the hours she had spent with 
the good Mr. Bantling. Then, a few moments later, she would 
forget that they had been talking jocosely, and would mention 
with impulsive earnestness some expedition she had made in the 
company of the gallant ex-guardsman. She would say u Oh, 
I know all about Versailles ; I went there with Mr. Bantling. 
I was bound to see it thoroughly I warned him when we went 
out there that I was thorough ; so we spent three days at the 
hotel and wandered all over the place. It was lovely weather 
a kind of Indian summer, only not so good. We just lived in 
that park. Oh yes ; you can't tell me anything about 
Versailles." Henrietta appeared to have made arrangements 
to meet Mr. Bantling in the spring, in Italy. 



XXI. 

MRS. TOUCHETT, before arriving in Paris, had fixed the day 
for her departure; and by the middle of February she had begun 
to travel southward. She did not go directly to Florence, but 
interrupted her journey to pay a visit to her son, who at San 
Kemo, on the Italian shore of the Mediterranean, had been 
spending a dull, bright winter, under a white umbrella. Isabel 
went with her aunt, as a matter of course, though Mrs. Touchett, 
with her usual homely logic, had laid before her a pair of alter- 
natives. 

" Now, of course, you are completely your own mistress," she 



192 . 

said. " Excuse me ; I don't mean that you were not so before. 
But you are on a different footing property erects a kind of 
"barrier. You can do a great many things if you are rich, which 
would be severely criticised if you were poor. You can go and 
come, you can travel alone, you can have your own establishment : 
I mean of course if you will take a companion some decayed 
gentlewoman with a darned cashmere and dyed hair, who paints 
on velvet. You don't think you would like that? Of course 
you can do as you please ; I only want you to understand that 
you are at liberty. You might take Miss Stackpole as your dame 
de compagnie ; she would keep people off very well. I think, 
however, that it is a great deal better you should remain with 
me, in spite of there being no obligation. It's better for several 
reasons, quite apart from your liking it. I shouldn't think you 
would like it, but I recommend you to make the sacrifice. Of 
course, whatever novelty there may have been at first in my 
society has quite passed away, and you see me as I am a dull, 
obstinate, narrow-minded old woman." 

" I don't think you are at all dull," Isa-bel had replied to this. 

" But you do think I am obstinate and narrow-minded? I 
told you so ! " said Mrs. Touchett, with much elation at being 
justified. 

Isabel remained for the present with her aunt, because, in 
spite of eccentric impulses, she had a great regard for what was 
usually deemed decent, and a young gentlewoman without visi- 
ble relations had always struck her as a flower without foliage. 
It was true that Mrs. Touchett's conversation had never again 
appeared so brilliant as that first afternoon in Albany, when she 
sat in her damp waterproof and sketched the opportunities that 
Europe would offer to a young person of taste. This, however, 
was in a great measure the girl's own fault; she had got a 
glimpse of her aunt's experience, and her imagination constantly 
anticipated the judgments and emotions of a woman .who had 
very little of the same faculty. Apart from this, Mrs. Touchett 
had a great merit ; she was as honest as a pair of compasses. 
There was a comfort in her stiffness and firmness ; you knew 
exactly where to find her, and were never liable to chance 
encounters with her. On her own ground she was always to be 
found ; but she was never over-inquisitive as regards the terri- 
tory of her neighbour. Isabel came at last to have a kind of 
undemonstrable pity for her ; there seemed something so dreary 
in the condition of a person whose nature had, as it were, so 
little surface offered so limited a face to the accretions of
