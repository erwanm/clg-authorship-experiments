" Will you have the goodness to inspect, since you are 
so fond of using the word, that and let me have your 
ladyship's judgment of it ?" 

He flung an envelope over to her so rudely, that it wizzed 
past her cheek and fell to the floor. Nowise disconcerted 
by his violent tone and action, she stooped to pick it up. 

"This is directed to Lily not to me !" she said, reading 
the address upon the back, 

" I am aware of that. You will find, notwithstanding, 
that it concerns Miss Helen Gardner very nearly. You 
recognize the handwriting, I presume ?" 

" I think that I do." 

"It bears a very tolerable resemblance to Mr. Robert 
Lay's, does it not?" 

" It does !" Helen laid the letter down with an air of un 
concern. 

" It was written by him, and intercepted by myself " 

" In that case I shall take the liberty of restoring it to 
the rightful owner," interrupted she, stretching her hand 
towards the letter. He secured it before she could touch it. 




" You had best not be over-hasty, young lady ! You 
may reverse your decision when you learn the contents of 
this epistle," tapping the cover meaningly. " This, which 
came into my possession this very afternoon, confirms what 
I have long suspected the fact of Robert Lay's infidelity to 
my wealthy ward, and real love for her poorer but more 
beautiful cousin. He tells Lily, here, that his heart has 
failed him at the eleventh hour ; that he cannot and will 
not, unless driven to it by her cruelty, carry out the pro 
jected union with yourself, and proposes an elopement upon 
his wedding-day. What say you to this pretty arrange 
ment ? It offers quite a refreshing variety to the ordinary 
hackneyed style of entering the hymeneal state, does it not ?" 

If demon ever wore a more fiendish smile than the sneer 
that curled his lip and looked evilly from his eye at that 
moment, it must have been the prince of devils himself. 

Helen's features hardened into stone beneath it. 

" I have nothing to say to such a tale, sir, except to in 
sist, still, that the letter shall be delivered to the person 
for whom it was intended !" 

" You do not care to read it yourself?" 

" Certainly I do not ! The act would be dishonorable." 

" You may perhaps not object to glance at the signature? 
It is boldly and well written !" 

Before she could draw back, or divine his intention, he 
thrust the open page abruply under her eyes. 

" Forever your own Robert? she could not help reading, 
in the round comely characters that were traced upon many 
a note to herself. 

" You refuse to take it still ! Your principles of honor 
are invulnerable, your curiosity stagnant ?" mocked her com 
panion, as she arose in offended dignity. 

" I have seen no reason why I should change my mind," 
she replied. 




" Be it as you will ! I shall not transmit this letter to the 
lady-love No. 2 of this fickle swain shall uphold Mammon's 
cause against Cupid's," continued Colonel Floyd, replacing 
the epistle within the envelope, then putting it, with ostentatious care, between the leaves of his pocket-book. " It is 
my duty to protect your reputation and your cousin's so 
long as you are inmates of my house, reckoned by the pub 
lic as members of my family. Disgrace is a word unknown 
in the Floyd annals. Mr. Lay's disappointment at not finding his bonny Lily at the place of rendezvous (not a euphonious, name for a romance Rock's Tavern !), his chagrin at 
her non-compliance with his petition, may produce a reaction 
in your favor ; so, do not despair of seeing him in his ap 
pointed position to-morrow evening." 

"If he comes I shall marry him, without demanding a 
word of explanation !" said the low, determined tones he 
had been used to hear from her, in her obstinate moods, 
since the days of her wilful childhood. 

" Very well ! What woman ever let c a good chance slip 
through her fingers ? I will oppose no obstacle to your manifest destiny, which is to show yourself to be as grand a fool 
as he is a knave !" rejoined her guardian, contemptuously. 
" The remainder of my business may with propriety be de 
layed until the knot is tied. There's many a slip twixt the 
cup and the lip ! I am to meet the amorous bridegroom at 
the clerk's office at eleven o'clock to-morrow, when he applies for his , marriage license. It will then be seen which 
of my wards he has finally decided to promote to the dignity 
of favorite in his harem. Fascinating creature ! what a pity 
he was not born in Turkey !" 

Nothing but Helen's indomitable pride enabled her to 
carry an unblenching front up to the last word spoken in 
this unlooked-for trial, this unprecedented emergency. 
Pride was her master-spirit. It had impelled her to the de- 




struction of her earthly happiness as a blind for a slighted, 
broken heart ; had bound her fast to the fulfilment of a rash 
and sinful vow ; it came to her aid now ; strengthened her 
to cast back disdainfully this crowning insult. 

" If, as I suppose, this is the climax of your choice observations, sir, I will, with your permission, retire !" 

She swept him a lofty courtesy in return for his mocking obeisance, and walked erect and haughtily from the 
room. Once out of his abhorred presence, she quickened 
her stately gait to a rapid flight; traversed hah  and 
porch, avoiding lighted apartments ; gained the little conservatory in the rear of the parlor, shut the door behind 
her, and sank upon a bench against the wall, panting and 
exhausted. 

" Am I going mad ? What am I to think ? What can 
I do ? GOD help me in this fearful strait !" 

The glimmer of the stars through the glass roof met her 
agonized upward glance, as the unwonted petition broke 
from her ; the holy watchers, beyond whose shining bands, 
HE dwelt whqm she blindly invoked. 

" Of purer eyes than to behold evil !" 

The text came unsought to her mind, and the swift infer 
ence followed "Then HE has neither notice nor compas 
sion for me !" 

They still beamed mildly, benignantly, upon her the 
eternal sentinels of Heaven ! and she could not withdraw her 
answering regards. Beneath their pure rays, as under the 
distilment of refreshing dews, feelings trampled, soiled, and 
crushed by the fierce rush of earth-born passions, began to 
revive and lift themselves anew. She had sowed the wind ; 
the whirlwind of humiliation and despair was the legitimate harvest ; but her proud spirit prayed in its writhings 
that she might be spared the direful punishment. Slowly 
sinking to her knees, she cried out of the depths to the All- 





merciful ; with tears and sighs besought Divine succor and 
support amid the snares that encompassed her. 

" Lead me into a plain path ! however hard and thorny 
it may be, I will tread it without a murmur ! Strengthen me 
to tell him the truth, and then do with me as Thou wilt. 
Keep far from me all bitter or revengeful thoughts of him 
for, oh ! am I not the more guilty of the two ? Did not my 
sin of unfaithfulness and deceit precede his ?" 

She still knelt still looked upward, in inaudible supplication, accompanied by fast-flowing tears, when the lock of the 
door, which she thought she had made fast at her entrance, 
was drawn back, and a figure glided in. The faint starlight 
revealed enough of the small figure and waxen face to show 
who was the intruder, if her cousin had not recognized her 
by the noiseless grace of her movements. Supposing that 
she had come on some errand that would not detain her 
more than a minute, Helen crouched lower to avoid being 
seen, and waited, with hushed breath, for her departure. 
Every fibre of her frame thrilled to the low cry of agony that 
stirred the silence of the place. Lily was standing by the 
orange-tree, which loomed up a pyramid of dusky white in 
the darkness ; bent over and caressed it as if it were a sentient thing, while sobs, mingled with incoherent lamentations, 
attested the depths and reality of her sorrow. 

Helen never afterwards inhaled the scent of orange-blos 
soms without a return of the heart-sickness, the deathly 
faintness of spirit, that came over her in that season of painful irresolution. Lily's heart was breaking, and she stood 
between her and happiness, she, with her empty vows and 
failing resolution ! and did not Robert approach the altar 
with a divided, if not a recreant heart ? 

" Oh, Helen ! if you could only know !" said Lily, with a 
fresh paroxysm of tears. 

In the woman's grief there was still a touch of the child's 





fretfulness and impatience at being thwarted. Helen seldom 
denied her any gratification which it was in her power to 
afford, and this moan appealed to the sympathies of the listen 
er with peculiar and pathetic force. She was the elder of 
the two the stronger and wiser ; her own folly and perverseness had brought her trouble upon her ; but what had 
this poor girl done that her life should be blighted ? 

" She does know, my darling !" 

Helen put her arm around her neck ; would have drawn 
her to her bosom ; spoken words of pity and of promise; but 
at her voice and touch Lily sprang back with a stifled shriek ; 
in her mad alarm, struck at the speaker with all her strength, 
and sped away like a frightened hare at the sound of the 
hunter's horn. 

The assault took Helen so entirely by surprise that she 
staggered against the orange-tree and fell to the floor with 
it. When she regained her feet, she was alone in the dark 
ness. She would not, she could not follow Lily then ! Hers 
was a generous and not implacable disposition, but it was 
notdn it to recover immediately from the indignation awakened by this unfeminine and uncousinly treatment. She had 
bruised her shoulder against the flower-stand, and her bosom 
ached intensely from the effects of Lily's blow. She had 
not meant to hurt her, Helen knew perhaps had not recognized the person who accosted her so unexpectedly but her 
hand had fallen sharply. 

" To morrow !" Helen promised herself. " By that time 
she may be ready to listen and I to speak calmly. A night 
of sober thought will be beneficial to both of us." 

Merriment and gamesome entertainment ran high in the 
parlor that evening, for the bridesmaids were not without 
their attendant tram of admirers. Yule-log and Christina 
jokes and wassail-cup were not wanting to enliven the youthful band, who watched for the first hour of the Advent-day 




and no smile was brighter, no voice more ready in laughter 
and song, no step more elastic in the dance than were Lily 
Calvert s. Etiquette and inclination for once united in advising that Helen should not appear below, and she had no 
fear of loneliness. She would be better satisfied if they 
would leave her to herself. 

Lily would have been as extravagantly gay, had her 
cousin been present in the hilarious gathering, for the blood 
that never tinged the alabaster skin yet seethed hotly in 
her veins ; rushed, a tumultuous tide, to and from the heart. 
Says Charlotte Bronte of a certain crisis in her heroine's 
life 

"It found her despairing it left her desperate two 
evidently different stages of feeling." 

The second, and more trying of these, Lily was now learn 
ing. 

And thus passed the eve of the wedding-day. 





CHAPTER VIII. 

Miss RUTH had slept but indifferently well the night be 
fore Christmas. Her maidenly dreams were vexed by 
images of bridal veils ; jellies that poured from the moulds 
in splashing, insipid liquids, when she would have had 
them pellucid, flavorous, and firm; torn kid gloves, that 
could not be mended , burnt and curdled custards ; cakes 
with sticky icing and streaky interiors; pie-crust heavy 
with rancid butter, or tough as leather for want of the for 
gotten " shortening ;" nuptial benedictions ; showers of 
tears ; hail-storms of kisses, congratulatory and confectionery ; jumbled inlf) a confusing, distracting medley, that al 
lowed her tortured brain not one hour of natural sleep out 
of the six she spent in bed. 

" Upon my word," said the good soul, when a ray of red 
light from the coming sun flecked the gray East, and ap 
prised her that the world would soon be awake " upon 
my word, I don't believe I could have rested worse if I 
were expecting to be married myself to-day and that is 
saying a good deal !" 

By sunrise she was dressed and had mustered her troop 
of menials. The happy pair were to come home for the 
second day's feast, the splendor of which was to suffer no 
diminution by contrast with Mrs. Floyd's wedding-supper. 
The same company would be present, and comparisons 
were inevitable. The dear woman was brave and confident 
in view of all this. She had not kept the cleanest house in 
three counties, and the best table in six, for twenty years, to 






be appalled by the array of any odds of this kind that could
