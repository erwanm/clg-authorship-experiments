the horse to plough in the cornfields, and such chores 
about the place as a boy could do. He liked to talk 
with Bobby because there was a great deal of good 
sense in him, for one with a small head. 

If there was any one thing upon which the squire 
particularly prided himself, it was his knowledge of 
human nature. He declared that he only wanted to 
look a man in the face to know what he was ; and as 
for Bobby Bright, he had summered him and wintered 
him, and he was satisfied that he would make some- 
thing in good time. 

He was not much astonished when Bobby opened 
his ambitious scheme of going into business for himself. 
But he had full faith in his ability to work out 
a useful and profitable, if not a brilliant life. He 
often said that Bobby was worth his weight in gold, 
and that he would trust him with any thing he had. 
Perhaps he did not suspect that the time was at hand 
when he would be called upon to verify his words 
practically ; for it was only that morning, when one 
of the neighbors told him about Bobby stopping the 
horse, that he had repeated the expression for the 
twentieth time. 

It was not an idle remark. Sixty dollars was 
hardly worth mentioning with a man of his wealth 
and liberal views, though so careful a man as he 
was would not have been likely to throw away that 
amount. But as a matter of investment, Bobby had 
made the note read " with interest," he would as 
readily have let him have it, as the next richest man 
in the place, so much confidence had he in our hero's 
integrity, and so sure was he that he would soon have 
the means of paying him. 

Bobby was overjoyed at the fortunate issue of his 
mission, and he walked into the room where his 
mother was closing shoes, with a dignity worthy a 



 

banker or a great merchant. Mrs. Bright was very 
sad. Perhaps she felt a little grieved th:tt her son, 
whom she loved so much, had so thoughtlessly 
plunged her into a new difficulty. 

"Come, cheer up, mother; it is all right," said 
Bobby in his usual elastic and gay tones ; and at the 
same time he took the sixty dollars from his pocket 
and handed it to her. " There is the money, and 
you will be forever quit of Mr. Hardhand to-morrow." 

" What, Bobbv ! Whv, where did vou get all this 


money ? " asked Mrs. Bright, utterly astonished. 

In a few words the ambitious boy told his story, 
and then informed his mother that he was going to 
Boston the next Monday morning, to commence busi- 
ness for himself. 

" Why, what can you do, Bobby ? ' 

"Do? I can do a great many things;" and he 
enfolded his scheme of becoming a little book mer- 
chant. 

" You are a courageous fellow ! Who would have 
thought of such a thing ! ' 

" I should, and did." 

" But you are not old enough." 



" O, yes, I am." 

" You had better wait a while." 

" Now or never, mother ! You see I have given 
my note, and my paper will be dishonored, if I am 
not up and doing." 

" Your paper ! ' ' said Mrs. Bright, with a smile. 

" That is what Mr. Wing, the boot manufacturer, 
calls it." 

" You needn't go away to earn this money ; I can 
pay it myself." 

" This note is my affair, and I mean to pay it my- 
self with my own earnings. No objections, mother." 

Like a sensible woman as she was, she did not 
make any objections. She was conscious of Bobby's 
talents ; she knew that he had a strong mind of his 
own, and could take care of himself. It is true, she 
feared the influence of the great world, and especially 
of the great city, upon the tender mind of her son ; 
but if he was never tempted, he would never be a 
conqueror over the foes that beset him. 

She determined to do her whole duty towards him ; 
and she carefully pointed out to him the sins and the 
moral danger to which he would be exposed, and 



 

warned him always to resist temptation. She coun- 
selled him to think of her when he felt like going 
astray. 

Bobby declared that he would try to be a good 
boy. He did not speak contemptuously of the an- 
ticipated perils, as many boys would have done, be- 
cause he knew that his mother would not make bug- 
bears out of things which she knew had no real ex- 
istence. 

The next day, Mr. Hardhand came ; and my young 
readers can judge how astonished and chagrined he 
was, when the widow Bright offered him the sixty 
dollars. The Lord was with the widow and the 
fatherless, and the wretch Avas cheated out of his 
revenge. The note was given up, and the mortgage 
cancelled. 

Mr. Hardhand insisted that she should pay the in- 
terest on the sixty dollars for one day, as it was then 
the second day of July ; but when Bobby reckoned it 
up, and found it was less than one cent, even the 
wretched miser seemed ashamed of himself, and 
changed the subject of conversation. 

He did not dare to say any thing saucy to the 



 

widow this time. He had lost his power over her, 
and there stood Bobby, who had convj to look just 
like a young lion to him, coward and knave as 
he was. 

The business was all settled now, and Bobby spent 
the rest of the week in getting ready for his great 
enterprise. He visited all his friends, and went each 
day to talk with Squire Lee and Annie. The little 
maiden promised to buy a great many books of 
him, if he would bring his stock to Riverdale, for 
she was quite as much interested in him as her 
father was. 

Monday morning came, and Bobby was out of bed 
with the first streak of dawn. The excitement of the 
great event which was about to happen had not per- 
mitted him to sleep for the two hours preceding ; yet 
when he got up, he could not help feeling sad. He 
was going to leave the little black house, going to 
leave his mother, going to leave the children, to de- 
part for the great city. 

His mother was up before him. She was even 
nore sad than he was, for she could see plainer than 
 the perils that environed him, and her maternal 



 

heart, in spite of the reasonable confidence she had in 
his integrity and good principles, trembled for his 
safety. 

As he ate his breakfast, his mother repeated the 
warnings and the good lessons she had before im- 
parted. She particularly cautioned him to keep out 
of bad company. If he found that his companions 
would lie and swear, he might depend upon it they 
would steal, and he had better forsake them at once. 
This was excellent advice, and Bobby had occasion at 
a later period to call it to his sorrowing heart. 

" Here is three dollars, Bobby ; it is all the money 
I have. Your fare to Boston will be one dollar, and 
you will have two left to pay the expenses of your 
first trip. It is all I have now," said Mrs. Bright. 

" I will not take the whole of it. You will want it 
yourself. One dollar is enough. When I find Mr. 
Bayard, I shall do very well." 

" Yes, Bobby, take the whole of it." 

" I will take just one dollar, and no more," replied 
Bobby, resolutely, as he handed her the other two 
dollars. 

"Do take it, Bobby." 


" No, mother ; it will only make me lazy and in- 
different." 

Taking a clean shirt, a pair of socks, and a hand- 
kerchief in his bundle, he was ready for a start. 

" Good by, mother," said he, kissing her and taking 
her hand. " I shall try and come home on Saturday, 
so as to be with you on Sunday." 

Then kissing the children, who had not yet got up, 
and to whom he had bidden adieu the night before, 
he left the house. He had seen the flood of tears 
that filled his mother's eyes, as he crossed the thresh- 
old ; and he could not help crying a little himself. 
It is a sad thing to leave one's home, one's mother, 
especially, to go out into the great world ; and we 
need not wonder that Bobby, who had hardly been 
out of Eiverdale before, should weep. But he soon 
restrained the flowing tears. 

" Now or never ! ' said he, and he put his best 
foot forward. 

It was an epoch in his history, and though he was 
too young to realize the importance of the event, he 
seemed to feel that what he did now was to give 
character to his whole future life. 




It was a bright and beautiful morning somehow, 
it is always a bright and beautiful morning when boys 
leave their homes to commence the journey of life; 
it is typical of the season of youth and hope, and it is 
meet that the sky should be clear, and the sun shine 
brightly, when the little pilgrim sets out upon his 
tour. He will see clouds and storms before he has 
gone far let him have a fair start. 

He had to walk five miles to the nearest railroad 
station. His road lay by the house of his friend, 
Squire Lee ; and as he was approaching it, he met 
Annie. She said she had come out to take her morn- 
ing walk ; but Bobby knew very well that she did not 
usually walk till an hour later ; which, with the fact 
that she had asked him particularly, the day before, 
what time he was going, made Bobby believe that she 
had come out to say good by, and bid him God 
speed on his journey. At any rate, he was very glad 
to see her. He said a great many pretty things to 
her, and talked so big about what he was going to do, 
that the little maiden could hardly help laughing in 
his face. 

Then at the house he shook hands with the squire, 




and sliook hands again with. Annie, and resumed his 
journey. His heart felt lighter for having met them, 
or at least for having met one of them, if not both ; 
for Annie's eyes were so full of sunshine that they 
seemed to gladden his heart, and make him feel truer 
and stronger. 

After a pleasant walk, for he scarcely heeded the 
distance, so full was he of his big thoughts, he 
reached the railroad station. The cars had not yet 
arrived, and would not for half an hour. 

" Why should I give them a dollar for carrying me 
to Boston, when I can just as well walk ? If I get 
tired, I can sit down and rest me. If I save the dol- 
lar, I shall have to earn only fifty-nine more to pay 
my note. So here goes ; " and he started down the 
track.
