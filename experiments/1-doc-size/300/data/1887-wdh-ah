about them than if they were young men dressed up. There isn’t a thing
lacking in the house here; there’s an awful completeness; but even
the ornaments seem laid on, like the hot and cold water. I never saw a
handsomer, more uninviting room than that drawing room. I suppose the
etching will come some time after supper. What do you think of it all,
Alice?”

“Oh, I don’t know. They must be very rich,” said the girl indifferently.

“You can’t tell. Country people of a certain kind are apt to put
everything on their backs and their walls and floors. Of course such a
house here doesn’t mean what it would in town.” She examined the texture
of the carpet more critically, and the curtains; she had no shame about
a curiosity that made her daughter shrink.

“Don’t, mamma!” pleaded the girl. “What if they should come?”

“They won’t come,” said Mrs. Pasmer; and her notice being called to
Alice, she made her take off the ribbon. “You’re better without it.”

“I’m so nervous I don’t know what I’m doing,” said Alice, removing it,
with a whimper.

“Well, I can’t have you breaking down!” cried her mother warningly:
she really wished to shake her, as a culmination of her own conflicting
emotions. “Alice, stop this instant! Stop it, I say!”

“But if I don’t like her?” whimpered Alice.

“You’re not going to marry her. Now stop! Here, bathe your eyes; they’re
all red. Though I don’t know that it matters. Yes, they’ll expect you to
have been crying,” said Mrs. Pasmer, seeing the situation more and
more clearly. “It’s perfectly natural.” But she took some cologne on a
handkerchief, and recomposed Alice’s countenance for her. “There, the
colour becomes you, and I never saw your eyes look so bright.”

There was a pathos in their brilliancy which of course betrayed her to
the Mavering girls. It softened Eunice, and encouraged Minnie, who
had been a little afraid of the Pasmers. They both kissed Alice with
sisterly affection. Their father merely saw how handsome she looked, and
Dan’s heart seemed to melt in his breast with tenderness.

In recognition of the different habits of their guests, they had dinner
instead of tea. The Portuguese cook had outdone himself, and course
followed course in triumphal succession. Mrs. Pasmer praised it all
with a sincerity that took away a little of the zest she felt in making
flattering speeches.

Everything about the table was perfect, but in a man’s fashion, like
the rest of the house. It lacked the atmospheric charm, the otherwise
indefinable grace, which a woman’s taste gives. It was in fact Elbridge
Mavering’s taste which had characterised the whole; the daughters simply
accepted and approved.

“Yes,” said Eunice, “we haven’t much else to do; so we eat. And Joe does
his best to spoil us.”

“Joe?”

“Joe’s the cook. All Portuguese cooks are Joe.”

“How very amusing!” said Mrs. Pasmer. “You must let me speak of your
grapes. I never saw anything so--well!--except your roses.”

“There you touched father in two tender spots. He cultivates both.”

“Really? Alice, did you ever see anything like these roses?”

Alice looked away from Dan a moment, and blushed to find that she had
been looking so long at him.

“Ah, I have,” said Mavering gallantly.

“Does he often do it?” asked Mrs. Pasmer, in an obvious aside to Eunice.

Dan answered for him. “He never had such a chance before.”

Between coffee, which they drank at table, and tea, which they were to
take in Mrs. Mavering’s room, they acted upon a suggestion from Eunice
that her father should show Mrs. Pasmer his rose-house. At one end of
the dining-room was a little apse of glass full of flowering plants
growing out of the ground, and with a delicate fountain tinkling in
their midst. Dan ran before the rest, and opened two glass doors in
the further side of this half-bubble, and at the same time with a touch
flashed up a succession of brilliant lights in some space beyond, from
which there gushed in a wave of hothouse fragrance, warm, heavy, humid.
It was a pretty little effect for guests new to the house, and was
part of Elbridge Mavering’s pleasure in this feature of his place.
Mrs. Pasmer responded with generous sympathy, for if she really liked
anything with her whole heart, it was an effect, and she traversed the
half-bubble by its pebbled path, showering praises right and left with
a fulness and accuracy that missed no detail, while Alice followed
silently, her hand in Minnie Mavering’s, and cold with suppressed
excitement. The rose-house was divided by a wall, pierced with frequent
doorways, over which the trees were trained and the roses hung; and on
either side were ranks of rare and costly kinds, weighed down with bud
and bloom. The air was thick with their breath and the pungent odours of
the rich soil from which they grew, and the glass roof was misted with
the mingled exhalations.

Mr. Mavering walked beside Alice, modestly explaining the difficulties
of rose culture, and his method of dealing with the red spider. He had a
stout knife in his hand, and he cropped long, heavy-laden stems of roses
from the walls and the beds, casually giving her their different names,
and laying them along his arm in a massive sheaf.

Mrs. Pasmer and Eunice had gone forward with Dan, and were waiting for
them at the thither end of the rose-house.

“Alice! just imagine: the grapery is beyond this,” cried the girl’s
mother.

“It’s a cold grapery,” said Mr. Mavering. “I hope you’ll see it
to-morrow.”

“Oh, why not to-night?” shouted Dan.

“Because it’s a cold grapery,” said Eunice; “and after this rose-house,
it’s an Arctic grapery. You’re crazy, Dan.”

“Well, I want Alice to see it anyway,” he persisted wilfully. “There’s
nothing like a cold grapery by starlight. I’ll get some wraps.” They all
knew that he wished to be alone with her a moment, and the three women,
consenting with their hearts, protested with their tongues, following
him in his flight with their chorus, and greeting his return. He muffled
her to the chin in a fur-lined overcoat, which he had laid hands on the
first thing; and her mother, still protesting, helped to tie a scarf
over her hair so as not to disarrange it. “Here,” he pointed, “we can
run through it, and it’s worth seeing. Better come,” he said to the
others as he opened the door, and hurried Alice down the path under the
keen sparkle of the crystal roof, blotched with the leaves and bunches
of the vines. Coming out of the dense, sensuous, vaporous air of the
rose-house into this clear, thin atmosphere, delicately penetrated
with the fragrance, pure and cold, of the fruit, it was as if they had
entered another world. His arm crept round her in the odorous obscurity.

“Look up! See the stars through the vines! But when she lifted her face
he bent his upon it for a wild kiss.

“Don’t! don’t!” she murmured. “I want to think; I don’t know what I’m
doing.”

“Neither do I. I feel as if I were a blessed ghost.”

Perhaps it is only in these ecstasies of the senses that the soul
ever reaches self-consciousness on earth; and it seems to be only the
man-soul which finds itself even in this abandon. The woman-soul has
always something else to think of.

“What shall we do,” said the girl, “if we--Oh, I dread to meet your
mother! Is she like either of your sisters?”

“No,” he cried joyously; “she’s like me. If you’re not afraid of me, and
you don’t seem to be--”

“You’re all I have--you’re all I have in the world. Do you think she’ll
like me? Oh, do you love me, Dan?”

“You darling! you divine--” The rest was a mad embrace. “If you’re not
afraid of me, you won’t mind mother. I wanted you here alone for just
a last word, to tell you you needn’t be afraid; to tell you to--But I
needn’t tell you how to act. You mustn’t treat her as an invalid--you
must treat her like any one else; that’s what she likes. But you’ll know
what’s best, Alice. Be yourself, and she’ll like you well enough. I’m
not afraid.”




XXXIII:

When she entered Mrs. Mavering’s room Alice first saw the pictures, the
bric-a-brac, the flowers, the dazzle of lights, and then the invalid
propped among her pillows, and vividly expectant of her. She seemed all
eager eyes to the girl, aware next of the strong resemblance to Dan in
her features, and of the careful toilet the sick woman had made for her.
To youth all forms of suffering are abhorrent, and Alice had to hide
a repugnance at sight of this spectre of what had once been a pretty
woman. Through the egotism with which so many years of flattering
subjection in her little world had armed her, Mrs. Mavering probably did
not feel the girl’s shrinking, or, if she did, took it for the natural
embarrassment which she would feel. She had satisfied herself that she
was looking her best, and that her cap and the lace jacket she wore were
very becoming, and softened her worst points; the hangings of her
bed and the richly embroidered crimson silk coverlet were part of
the coquetry of her costume, from which habit had taken all sense of
ghastliness; she was proud of them, and she was not aware of the scent
of drugs that insisted through the odour of the flowers.

She lifted herself on her elbow as Dan approached with Alice, and the
girl felt as if an intense light had been thrown upon her from head to
foot in the moment of searching scrutiny that followed. The invalid’s
set look broke into a smile, and she put out her hand, neither hot nor
cold, but of a dry neutral, spiritual temperature, and pulled Alice down
and kissed her.

“Why, child, your hand’s like ice!” she exclaimed without preamble. “We
used to say that came from a warm heart.”

“I guess it comes from a cold grapery in this case, mother,” said Dan,
with his laugh. “I’ve just been running Alice through it. And perhaps a
little excitement--”

“Excitement?” echoed his mother. “Cold grapery, I dare say, and very
silly of you, Dan; but there’s no occasion for excitement, as if we were
strangers. Sit down in that chair, my dear. And, Dan, you go round
to the other side of the bed; I want Alice all to myself. I saw your
photograph a week ago, and I’ve thought about you for ages since, and
wondered whether you would approve of your old friend.”

“Oh yes,” whispered the girl, suppressing a tremor; and Dan’s eyes were
suffused with grateful tears at his mother’s graciousness.

Alice’s reticence seemed to please the invalid. “I hope you’ll like all
your old friends here; you’ve begun with the worst among us, but perhaps
you like him the best because he is the worst; I do.”

“You may believe just half of that, Alice,” cried Dan.

“Then believe the best half, or the half you like best,” said Mrs.
Mavering. “There must be something good in him if you like him. Have
they welcomed you home, my dear?”

“We’ve all made a stagger at it,” said Dan, while Alice was faltering
over the words which were so slow to come.

“Don’t try to answer my formal stupidities. You are welcome, and that’s
enough, and more than enough of speeches. Did you have a comfortable
journey up?”

“Oh, very.”

“Was it cold?”

“Not at all. The cars were very hot.”

“Have you had any snow yet at Boston?”

“No, none at all yet.”

“Now I feel that we’re talking sense. I hope you found everything in
your room? I can’t look after things as I would like, and so I inquire.”

“There’s everything,” said Alice. “We’re very comfortable.”

“I’m very glad. I had Dan look, he’s my housekeeper; he understands me
better than my girls; he’s like me, more. That’s what makes us so fond
of each other; it’s a kind of personal vanity. But he has his good
points, Dan has. He’s very amiable, and I was too, at his age--and till
I came here. But I’m not going to tell you of his good points; I dare
say you’ve found them out. I’ll tell you about his bad ones. He says
you’re very serious. Are you?” She pressed the girl’s hand, which she
had kept in hers, and regarded her keenly.

Alice dropped her eyes at the odd question. “I don’t know,” she
faltered. “Sometimes.”

“Well, that’s good. Dan’s frivolous.”

“Oh, sometimes--only sometimes!” he interposed.

“He’s frivolous, and he’s very light-minded; but he’s none the worse for
that.”

“Oh, thank you,” said Dan; and Alice, still puzzled, laughed
provisionally.

“No; I want you to understand that. He’s light-hearted too, and that’s
a great thing in this world. If you’re serious you’ll be apt to be
heavyhearted, and then you’ll find Dan of use. And I hope he’ll know
how, to turn your seriousness to account too, he needs something to keep
him down--to keep him from blowing away. Yes, it’s very well for people
to be opposites. Only they must understand each other, If they do that,
then they get along. Light-heartedness or heavy-heartedness comes to the
same thing if they know how to use it for each other. You see, I’ve
got to be a great philosopher lying here; nobody dares contradict me
or interrupt me when I’m constructing my theories, and so I get them
perfect.”

“I wish I could hear them all,” said Alice, with sincerity that made
Mrs. Mavering laugh as light-heartedly as Dan himself, and that seemed
to suggest the nest thing to her.

“You can for the asking, almost any time. Are you a very truthful
person, my dear? Don’t take the trouble to deny it if you are,” she
added, at Alice’s stare. “You see, I’m not at all conventional and
you needn’t be. Come! tell the truth for once, at any rate. Are you
habitually truthful?”

“Yes, I think I am,” said Alice, still staring.

“Dan’s not,” said his mother quietly.

“Oh, see here, now, mother! Don’t give me away!”

“He’ll tell the truth in extremity, of course, and he’ll tell it if it’s
pleasant, always; but if you don’t expect much more of him you won’t be
disappointed; and you can make him of great use.”

“You see where I got it, anyway, Alice,” said Dan, laughing across the
