The people in England who are so very busy in searching out evidence
against my true story have searched out and given to the world an
important confirmation of this assertion of Lady Byron's.

It seems that the confidential waiting-maid who went with Lady Byron
on her wedding journey has been sought out and interrogated, and, as
appears by description, is a venerable, respectable old person, quite
in possession of all her senses in general, and of that sixth sense of
propriety in particular, which appears not to be a common virtue in our
days.

As her testimony is important, we insert it just here, with a
description of her person in full. The ardent investigators thus
speak:--

 'Having gained admission, we were shown into a small but neatly
 furnished and scrupulously clean apartment, where sat the object
 of our visit. Mrs. Mimms is a venerable-looking old lady, of short
 stature, slight and active appearance, with a singularly bright and
 intelligent countenance. Although midway between eighty and ninety
 years of age, she is in full possession of her faculties, discourses
 freely and cheerfully, hears apparently as well as ever she did,
 and her sight is so good that, aided by a pair of spectacles, she
 reads the Chronicle every day with ease. Some idea of her competency
 to contribute valuable evidence to the subject which now so much
 engages public attention on three continents may be found from her
 own narrative of her personal relations with Lady Byron. Mrs. Mimms
 was born in the neighbourhood of Seaham, and knew Lady Byron from
 childhood. During the long period of ten years she was Miss Milbanke's
 lady's-maid, and in that capacity became the close confidante of her
 mistress. There were circumstances which rendered their relationship
 peculiarly intimate. Miss Milbanke had no sister or female friend
 to whom she was bound by the ties of more than a common affection;
 and her mother, whatever other excellent qualities she may have
 possessed, was too high-spirited and too hasty in temper to attract
 the sympathies of the young. Some months before Miss Milbanke was
 married to Lord Byron, Mrs. Mimms had quitted her service on the
 occasion of her own marriage with Mr. Mimms; but she continued to
 reside in the neighbourhood of Seaham, and remained on the most
 friendly terms with her former mistress. As the courtship proceeded,
 Miss Milbanke concealed nothing from her faithful attendant; and
 when the wedding-day was fixed, she begged Mrs. Mimms to return and
 fulfil the duties of lady's-maid, at least during the honeymoon. Mrs.
 Mimms at the time was nursing her first child, and it was no small
 sacrifice to quit her own home at such a moment, but she could not
 refuse her old mistress's request. Accordingly, she returned to Seaham
 Hall some days before the wedding, was present at the ceremony, and
 then preceded Lord and Lady Byron to Halnaby Hall, near Croft, in the
 North Riding of Yorkshire, one of Sir Ralph Milbanke's seats, where
 the newly married couple were to spend the honeymoon. Mrs. Mimms
 remained with Lord and Lady Byron during the three weeks they spent at
 Halnaby Hall, and then accompanied them to Seaham, where they spent
 the next six weeks. It was during the latter period that she finally
 quitted Lady Byron's service; but she remained in the most friendly
 communication with her ladyship till the death of the latter, and for
 some time was living in the neighbourhood of Lady Byron's residence
 in Leicestershire, where she had frequent opportunities of seeing her
 former mistress. It may be added that Lady Byron was not unmindful of
 the faithful services of her friend and attendant in the instructions
 to her executors contained in her will. Such was the position of Mrs.
 Mimms towards Lady Byron; and we think no one will question that
 it was of a nature to entitle all that Mrs. Mimms may say on the
 subject of the relations of Lord and Lady Byron to the most respectful
 consideration and credit.'

Such is the chronicler's account of the faithful creature whom nothing
but intense indignation and disgust at Mrs. Beecher Stowe would lead
to speak on her mistress's affairs; but Mrs. Beecher Stowe feels none
the less sincere respect for her, and is none the less obliged to her
for having spoken. Much of Mrs. Mimms's testimony will be referred to
in another place; we only extract one passage, to show that while Lord
Byron spent his time in setting afloat slanders against his wife, she
spent hers in sealing the mouths of witnesses against him.

Of the period of the honeymoon Mrs. Mimms says:--

 'The happiness of Lady Byron, however, was of brief duration; even
 during the short three weeks they spent at Halnaby, the irregularities
 of Lord Byron occasioned her the greatest distress, and she even
 contemplated returning to her father. Mrs. Mimms was her constant
 companion and confidante through this painful period, and she does not
 believe that her ladyship concealed a thought from her. With laudable
 reticence, the old lady absolutely refuses to disclose the particulars
 of Lord Byron's misconduct at this time; she gave Lady Byron a solemn
 promise not to do so.

        *       *       *       *       *

 'So serious did Mrs. Mimms consider the conduct of Lord Byron, that
 she recommended her mistress to confide all the circumstances to her
 father, Sir Ralph Milbanke, a calm, kind, and most excellent parent,
 and take his advice as to her future course. At one time Mrs. Mimms
 thinks Lady Byron had resolved to follow her counsel and impart her
 wrongs to Sir Ralph; but on arriving at Seaham Hall her ladyship
 strictly enjoined Mrs. Mimms to preserve absolute silence on the
 subject--a course which she followed herself;--so that when, six weeks
 later, she and Lord Byron left Seaham for London, not a word had
 escaped her to disturb her parents' tranquility as to their daughter's
 domestic happiness. As might be expected, Mrs. Mimms bears the
 warmest testimony to the noble and lovable qualities of her departed
 mistress. She also declares that Lady Byron was by no means of a cold
 temperament, but that the affectionate impulses of her nature were
 checked by the unkind treatment she experienced from her husband.'

We have already shown that Lord Byron had been, ever since his
separation, engaged in a systematic attempt to reverse the judgment of
the world against himself, by making converts of all his friends to a
most odious view of his wife's character, and inspiring them with the
zeal of propagandists to spread these views through society. We have
seen how he prepared partisans to interpret the Fourth Canto of 'Childe
Harold.'

This plan of solemn and heroic accusation was the first public attack
on his wife. Next we see him commencing a scurrilous attempt to turn
her to ridicule in the First Canto of 'Don Juan.'

It is to our point now to show how carefully and cautiously this Don
Juan campaign was planned.

Vol. IV. p. 138, we find Letter 325 to Mr. Murray:--

  'VENICE: January 25, 1819.

 'You will do me the favour to print privately, for private
 distribution, fifty copies of "Don Juan." The list of the men to whom
 I wish it presented I will send hereafter.'

The poem, as will be remembered, begins with the meanest and foulest
attack on his wife that ever ribald wrote, and puts it in close
neighbourhood with scenes which every pure man or woman must feel
to be the beastly utterances of a man who had lost all sense of
decency. Such a potion was too strong to be administered even in a
time when great license was allowed, and men were not over-nice. But
Byron chooses fifty armour-bearers of that class of men who would
find indecent ribaldry about a wife a good joke, and talk about the
'artistic merits' of things which we hope would make an honest boy
blush.

At this time he acknowledges that his vices had brought him to a state
of great exhaustion, attended by such debility of the stomach that
nothing remained on it; and adds, 'I was obliged to reform my way of
life, which was conducting me from the yellow leaf to the ground with
all deliberate speed.'[13] But as his health is a little better he
employs it in making the way to death and hell elegantly easy for other
young men, by breaking down the remaining scruples of a society not
over-scrupulous.

[Footnote 13: Vol. iv. p 143.]

Society revolted, however, and fought stoutly against the nauseous
dose. His sister wrote to him that she heard such things said of it
that she never would read it; and the outcry against it on the part
of all women of his acquaintance was such that for a time he was quite
overborne; and the Countess Guiccioli finally extorted a promise from
him to cease writing it. Nevertheless, there came a time when England
accepted 'Don Juan,'--when Wilson, in the 'Noctes Ambrosian√¶,' praised
it as a classic, and took every opportunity to reprobate Lady Byron's
conduct. When first it appeared the 'Blackwood' came out with that
indignant denunciation of which we have spoken, and to which Byron
replied in the extracts we have already quoted. He did something more
than reply. He marked out Wilson as one of the strongest literary men
of the day, and set his 'initiated' with their documents to work upon
him.

One of these documents to which he requested Wilson's attention was the
private autobiography, written expressly to give his own story of all
the facts of the marriage and separation.

In the indignant letter he writes Murray on the 'Blackwood' article,
Vol. IV., Letter 350--under date December 10, 1819--he says:--

 'I sent home for Moore, and for Moore only (who has my journal also),
 my memoir written up to 1816, and I gave him leave to show it to
 whom he pleased, but not to publish on any account. You may read
 it, and you may let Wilson read it if he likes--not for his public
 opinion, but his private, for I like the man, and care very little
 about the magazine. And I could wish Lady Byron herself to read
 it, that she may have it in her power to mark anything mistaken or
 misstated. As it will never appear till after my extinction, it would
 be but fair she should see it; that is to say, herself willing. Your
 "Blackwood" accuses me of treating women harshly; but I have been
 their martyr; my whole life has been sacrificed to them and by them.'

It was a part of Byron's policy to place Lady Byron in positions before
the world where she could not speak, and where her silence would be
set down to her as haughty, stony indifference and obstinacy. Such was
the pretended negotiation through Madame de Sta√´l, and such now this
apparently fair and generous offer to let Lady Byron see and mark this
manuscript.

The little Ada is now in her fifth year--a child of singular
sensibility and remarkable mental powers--one of those exceptional
children who are so perilous a charge for a mother.

Her husband proposes this artful snare to her,--that she shall mark
what is false in a statement which is all built on a damning lie, that
she cannot refute over that daughter's head,--and which would perhaps
be her ruin to discuss.

Hence came an addition of two more documents, to be used 'privately
among friends,'[14] and which 'Blackwood' uses after Lady Byron is
safely out of the world to cast ignominy on her grave--the wife's
letter, that of a mother standing at bay for her daughter, knowing that
she is dealing with a desperate, powerful, unscrupulous enemy.

  'KIRKBY MALLORY: March 10, 1820.

 [Footnote 14: Lord Byron took especial pains to point out to Murray
 the importance of these two letters. Vol. V. Letter 443, he says: 'You
 must also have from Mr. Moore the correspondence between me and Lady
 B., to whom I offered a sight of all that concerns herself in these
 papers. This is important. He has her letter and my answer.']

 'I received your letter of January 1, offering to my perusal a
 Memoir of part of your life. I decline to inspect it. I consider
 the publication or circulation of such a composition at any time as
 prejudicial to Ada's future happiness. For my own sake, I have no
 reason to shrink from publication; but, notwithstanding the injuries
 which I have suffered, I should lament some of the consequences.

  'A. BYRON.

  'To Lord Byron.'

Lord Byron, writing for the public, as is his custom, makes reply:--

  'RAVENNA: April 3, 1820.

 'I received yesterday your answer, dated March 10. My offer was an
 honest one, and surely could only be construed as such even by the
 most malignant casuistry. I could answer you, but it is too late, and
 it is not worth while. To the mysterious menace of the last sentence,
 whatever its import may be--and I cannot pretend to unriddle it--I
 could hardly be very sensible even if I understood it, as, before it
 can take place, I shall be where "nothing can touch him further".... I
 advise you, however, to anticipate the period of your intention, for,
 be assured, no power of figures can avail beyond the present; and if
 it could, I would answer with the Florentine:--

  '"Ed io, che posto son con loro in croce
                            ... e certo
  La fiera moglie, pi√π ch' altro, mi nuoce."[15]

  'BYRON.

  'To Lady Byron.'

[Footnote 15:

  'And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
                                    ... truly
  My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.'

  Inferno, Canto, XVI., Longfellow's translation.
]

Two things are very evident in this correspondence: Lady Byron
intimates that, if he publishes his story, some consequences must
follow which she shall regret.

Lord Byron receives this as a threat, and says he doesn't understand
it. But directly after he says, 'Before IT can take place, I shall be,'
&c.

The intimation is quite clear. He does understand what the
consequences alluded to are. They are evidently that Lady Byron will
speak out and tell her story. He says she cannot do this till after
he is dead, and then he shall not care. In allusion to her accuracy
as to dates and figures, he says: 'Be assured no power of figures can
avail beyond the present' (life); and then ironically advises her to
anticipate the period,--i.e. to speak out while he is alive.

In Vol. VI. Letter 518, which Lord Byron wrote to Lady Byron, but did
not send, he says: 'I burned your last note for two reasons,--firstly,
because it was written in a style not very agreeable; and, secondly,
because I wished to take your word without documents, which are the
resources of worldly and suspicious people.'

It would appear from this that there was a last letter of Lady Byron
to her husband, which he did not think proper to keep on hand, or show
to the 'initiated' with his usual unreserve; that this letter contained
some kind of pledge for which he preferred to take her word, without
documents.

Each reader can imagine for himself what that pledge might have been;
but from the tenor of the three letters we should infer that it was a
promise of silence for his lifetime, on certain conditions, and that
the publication of the autobiography would violate those conditions,
and make it her duty to speak out.

This celebrated autobiography forms so conspicuous a figure in the
whole history, that the reader must have a full idea of it, as given by
Byron himself, in Vol. IV. Letter 344, to Murray:--

 'I gave to Moore, who is gone to Rome, my life in MS.,--in
 seventy-eight folio sheets, brought down to 1816 ... also a journal
 kept in 1814. Neither are for publication during my life, but when I
 am cold you may do what you please. In the mean time, if you like to
 read them you may, and show them to anybody you like. I care not....'
