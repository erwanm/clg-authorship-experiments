crept down the back stairs, being minded, she 
could hardly have told why, to escape him. She 
stepped into the living-room, thinking that she 
would light the gas, but did not light it, and sat 
down in the dark, irresolute. The office door was 
open. Within its plaque of light she saw the man, 
the child, and the dog, — each quiet, and all con- 
tent. The collie was asleep, with his long nose 
upon the doctor's foot. But Joyce — where was 
the boy ? At first she doubted the evidence of her 
optic nerve, and smote the mist from her smart- 
ing eyes to see, and see again, the curling child 
cuddled beneath a white beard in the stranger's 
neck ; like a love into a cloud or mantle ; a little 
melting shape that trusted where she questioned, 
and clung when she rebuffed. 

In the dark there, unseen, and now unseeing, 
her face fell into her hands. Against every fibre 
of her nature, every sinew of her will, she found 
herself dragged by the undertow of a mysterious 
attraction. How should a high-minded woman 
experience the tides that dashed her feeling to 
and fro ? She sat drowned in the crimson of her 
self-scorn. For there are three tidal waves on the 
ocean of widowhood. If the first is loneliness and 
the second despairing doubt, the third is disloyalty 
to the dead. 

Carolyn felt that she was in the breakers of her 
 

own being. She called upon her husband's name 
and memory as she would have called upon the 
power of God if she had been a drowning woman. 

"Chanceford! Chanceford! Can't you help 
me?" 

The click of the front-door latch interrupted 
this prayer of the wife. When she looked, the 
office was empty. Clyde was fumbling in her neck 
with his cold nose, and her little boy — less keen 
of divination than the dog — stood calling for her 
in the hall. She heard the tired step of the lame 
doctor limping down the path. 

Sterling Hart was uneasy. Himself he would 
have flung to any fate for Cara's sake. He would 
have effaced himself from her life if that could 
have purchased her happiness. To give her joy he 
would have paid any price in personal suffering. 
His feeling was as simple as Christianity, whose 
other name is sacrifice. It could hardly be said 
that personal hope entered very much into his 
consciousness at this or any other time; although, 
perhaps, more at this than any other. But that he 
was distinctly uneasy he did not deny to himself. 
His cousin's acquaintance with the physician, her 
tenant, troubled him. 

Any persistent idea is a stream which 
everything tends to increase. Rivulets of impressions 

 

from one source or another ran into the preacher's 
prevailing anxiety for Carolyn. One September 
day he saw Mrs. Marriot driving a Salvation Army 
lassie to the train, and on the way home she over- 
took him, beckoning. 

" Is Mrs. Dane going to marry the new doctor?" 
she asked point-blank. "He is a brilliant 
fellow, and he saved my life. I am under 
obligations to him that one can never overlook ; and it 
is plainly not my business, Mr. Hart. But — " 

" But what ? " demanded the preacher. 

" I don't know," replied Douce Marriot. " That 's 
just it — I dorit know but what." 

In October Nannie Hops came on some trifling 
pretext to the preacher's house. The girl seemed 
troubled, and there was a tangle in her pretty 
brows. 

" Father returns the magazines," she began. 
" He thanks you, Mr. Hart. Mrs. Dane and I car- 
ried some to the Art School to show the pictures. 
Mr. Hart, there 's something I want to say to you. 
It is about Mrs. Dane." 

" Go on," said the preacher, for Nannie stopped. 

"If she should marry Dr. Royal — "faltered 
Nannie. "You know how much we think of Dr. 
Royal, don't you ? You won't take me the wrong 
way, will you ? I — why, I admire Dr. Royal ! " cried 
Nannie, vehemently. "But — " 

 

"But what?" asked Sterling Hart, as he had 
asked before. And, as before, the answer came : " I 
don't know — Mr. Hart, I don t know. There are 
things — " 

" What things ? " 

" I don't know how to explain myself. There 
seem to be reasons — " 

" What reasons ? " persisted the preacher. 

"That's just it," said Nannie. " If I could put 
my reasons so you could understand them, — but 
I can't do it. I don't know how to tell you why I 
feel the way I do." 

" I think you ought to be explicit," replied Cara's 
kinsman, frowning. 

Nannie said a few words in a lowered voice. 

" Is that all ? " cried the preacher. He gave a 
large masculine wave of the hand, as if he dis- 
missed an unimportant and feminine thought. 

" It is nothing against Dr. Royal ! " repeated 
Nannie. " It isn't the first thing against Dr. 
Royal. But — Mr. Hart! Don't let Mrs. Dane 
marry again. Don't let her marry ##ybody. It — 
it 's too soon." 

The preacher stared at the excited girl; he had 
gone quite pale. He felt, for the instant, as if a 
sacred secret, scarcely admitted by his own soul 
to itself, had come back to him from the atmos- 
phere in articulation. 

 

It proved to be a cold winter, and life in the 
cottage became difficult and bare, accordingly. 
All that remained of the threadbare nasturtium 
draperies on the piazza trellis broke away under 
the first big storm like a valuable old rug that has 
been put into a washtub. The furnace was middle- 
aged and as fretful as a sick woman. The 
plumbing was fickle, and the halls drafty. Kathleen had 
the toothache, and Joyce took cold. The boy's 
little illnesses the doctor treated skillfully, with a 
care amounting to tenderness. To the assortment 
of emotions with which she now regarded her ten- 
ant, Carolyn began to add gratitude. 

Dr. Royal was chronically, ingeniously kind. 
Too often she heard him limp down the cellar 
stairs on a bitter evening, to feed or inspect the 
old, cold furnace for her. Sometimes in the drift- 
ing snows she would find the lame man digging 
out her paths. He put aside her protests as if they 
had been snowflakes that he rubbed out of his 
eyes ; quite silently. It proved difficult to conceal 
the shifts and secrets of her impoverished house- 
hold from him. Nothing escaped his knowledge, 
as nothing eluded his relieving instinct. He 
began to seem to her the most thoughtful of men. 
Over the disk of other manly qualities that she 
had known his slowly advanced; as an eclipse 
slides over the moon or the sun. It was 
impossible to disown the terrible candor of memory 
which confronted the dead with the living; and 
unhappily for the ghos.t of Chanceford Dane, mar- 
riage had not expiated the faults of his careless 
nature to his wife. 

Dane's had been a gay, gregarious nature, debo- 
nair and winning. Charles Royal was a thought- 
ful man, personally unattractive, and morally a 
magnet. Dane had not been always kind. The 
doctor had an undiverted tenderness. Dane had 
neglected her when he felt inclined. Royal had 
the plain, domestic devotion which women rate 
so high in the scale of masculine qualities. Dane 
had demanded everything, and given what he 
chose. This man asked nothing, and gave her all 
he had — his silent homage, his delicate protec- 
tion. He had the attitude of romance in the dull 
conditions of daily life. He was to her as if she had 
been the queen of the sad earth and the happy 
heaven. Yet it was impossible for her to deceive 
herself — she knew that he loved her; the more, 
because he did not say so. Her common prudence 
and common sense taught her that this man of an 
unknown past, of an uncertain future, must not 
be permitted to endear himself to her. But her 
trembling heart told her that she was approaching 
the invisible boundary where a man and woman 
must separate or unite. She recognized the way- 

 

marks of the familiar road with the cautious can- 
dor of one who experiences a second love, and 
who would convince herself, if she could, that she 
was not disloyal to the first. Again she knew the 
eternal pang and the eternal joy which keep the 
world's heart young. 

" This cannot last," she said. " I must put an 
end to it." Sometimes she added, with the docility 
of a little girl who lives in awe of family traditions, 
" Cousin Sterling is perfectly right. It has got to 
stop." 

But nothing stopped. The romance and the 
winter ran their course. As Cara sat attentive to 
the rhythm of the surf upon the ice-bound coast, 
it seemed to her as if she listened to some ancient 
saga frosted with the rapture and the bitterness 
of life; to some perplexity as new as last moon's 
phases ; some secret as inscrutable as to-morrow's 
fate. 

Sterling Hart watched her with mute, strong 
eyes. He came out frequently from the city ; so 
often that she felt the silent protest of his presence 
against the current of her heart. He observed her 
sadly. Less and less he argued with her or coun- 
seled her. Once again he felt himself rivaled by 
the inferior nature. Now, as before, he was baffled 
by the magic which wove its web around her. 

It will be well remembered by his people and 


by the public that the Reverend Sterling Hart 
did that year a thing not very common in the 
pulpit of his church, and without recent precedent 
in his own. He preached what is known in the 
phraseology of moral reform as a temperance 
sermon. 

It was a Sunday evening sermon, after Easter, 
in late April. The church was crowded to the 
aisles, and largely filled with men. It had been 
understood that the eminent clergyman would 
treat the subject of the drinking habit, and a
perplexed surprise was felt by the ignorant — none 
whatever by the wise — when it was noted that he 
handled his vulgar theme with an extraordinary 
reserve. 

He did not describe degradation. He portrayed 
nobility. He did not depict the deformities of sin. 
He dwelt on the beauty of holiness. He spoke 
of honor, of self-control, of purity. He spoke of 
strong and steadfast qualities, of beautiful and 
winning things; of all that is high-minded, whole- 
souled, and clean-bodied ; of all that a man might 
be who honored his manhood — not of what he 
had become who had failed in reverence for it. 
Once he drew himself to his commanding height 
(one of his people who loved him used to call it 
"his archangel size"), and his noble countenance 
blazed with a white fire of contempt and pity such 

 

as one may live a long life and not see on any 
face. 

" And yet," he said, " there are men who give 
themselves up to low sins . . . and drunkenness? 

As the preacher spoke these words, far back in 
the packed house his luminous eye fell upon two 
men, one young, one elderly, sitting side by side, 
and listening with held breath. Something in their 
attitude and absorption, something more in their 
appearance, arrested his attention. One of the men 
he knew, and the other — he thought the other 
was no stranger. But as he gazed, out of the man's 
soul there leaped a look — one only — before which 
the preacher's startled heart stood still. As soon 
as the service came to an end he disappeared 
from sight, and in an incredible time, still in 
his gown and surplice, his forehead wet yet with 
his emotion, reappeared in the crowd of 
worshipers who were thronging to the vestibule. The 
younger of the two men who had aroused his
attention was about to push through the muffled 
doors when the clergyman laid a hand upon his 
shoulder. 

" Timothy ? Timothy George ? "
