“Yes,’' her mother answered, gravely. 
‘'We ought to be thankful that God has 
placed us above want.'’ 

Jessie went to her bank. It never had 
a very large surplus on hand. Twenty 
cents— that was not near a dollar! So 
she gave a little sigh. 

This was what her mother’s words re- 
called. She looked rather sober over it 
for several moments. 

dollar is a good deal for a little 
girl to give away,” she said, slowly, as 
the result of her thoughts. 

"It did not seem so yesterday. It 
is often easier to be charitable with that 
which we do not possess. ’ ’ 

" One can ’t give them when one hasn ’t 
anything, ” Jessie said ; and the absurdity 
made her smile a little. 

"And it is unfortunate not to have 





the heart and the money at the same 
time. ’ ' 

Jessie did not reply. It was nearly 
schooltime; so she hunted up her hood, 
her squirrel tippet and muff, and her 
good, warm cloak. She had never suf- 
fered from any cold or neglect, and there 
was a sudden rush of gratitude in her 
heart, for it was a sweet, true, and tender 
heart. 

'‘Good-by, mamma, and she came to 
kiss her. Then she strapped her books 
together and hung them on her arm and 
ran down the path. 

Should she give Mrs. Adams her dol- 
lar! There were so many things that 
she wanted. She just halted at Warner’s 
store-window. There was a box of 
paints that were only a dollar— she had 
made two or three inetfectual attempts 




to save up her money and get them. 
And there was a crying baby with the 
loveliest blue eyes. Her dolly was past 
the crying stage— she would just go in 
and price this one— it was such fun to 
have the squeaking little thing ! ‘ ' Seven- 
ty-five cents.’’ It was a beauty. And 
there was a lovely toy in the shape 
of a pretty carved egg-cup, with an egg 
in it. When you touched a spring in the 
bottom, the upper half of the egg flew 
off, and the prettiest little fairy made 
you a bow. That was a dollar. And a 
drawing-slate, with such a charming 
variety of landscapes, castles, birds, 
flowers, and nearly everything. Oh ! 
what beautiful things one could buy with 
a dollar! 

‘'Will you take this baby!” and the 
shopwoman made it cry like a real live 




baby, and all the while there was such 
a roguish look in its blue eyes. 

"Not just now,’' Jessie said, faintly, 
and turned away. 

‘'Oh! you like this cup better’'; and 
then the woman made the fairy spring 
up so suddenly that Jessie jumped, too. 
How she could startle the boys with it ! 

won’t take any of them now,” 
Jessie said, with sudden determination, 
and then went out. She had to run to 
school to be there in time. 

At recess, Martha Lee displayed a 
beautiful rubber ring with a pearl in it. 
It looked so pretty on her white, slender 
fingers. 

‘ ' It cost just a dollar, ’ ’ she said, ‘ ' and 
I saved up all my pennies to buy it.” 
Then she let Jessie try it on. The boys 
had made Jessie several rings, but they 




had not the smooth finish of this. And 
then the pearl ! 

mean to have one/’ exclaimed Bell 
Anders; ‘‘I’ve about seventy cents saved 
up.” 

Jessie looked at her finger and decided 
that she wanted one, also. To be sure, 
there was her pretty birthday ring, with 
rubies, but that wasn’t black. The pearl 
looked so lovely in the jetty setting. 

Poor Jessie! By the time she had 
gone home to dinner and come back 
again, Warner’s store seemed as full of 
treasures as the magic cave, and there 
were so many things that cost just a dol- 
lar. Her money was fast burning a hole 
in her pocket. It seems strange that it 
should have this faculty, but it does ap- 
pear to produce a curious kind of com- 
bustion. Did you ever feel your fingers 




tingle and burn when yon touched three 
or four pennies in your pocket, and could 
you not almost taste the delightful taffy- 
candy that the little old woman, two 
doors from the school, sold? 

Mrs. Adams ' pale face and troubled 
eyes interfered with Jessie’s peace of 
mind. She certainly thought yesterday 
that if she had a dollar she would give 
it to her. Why did she not want to now ? 

Clara Adams hasn’t been to school 
to-day,” Miss Trusdell said. "Who 
goes near her house?” 

Jessie swallowed a great lump that 
seemed to rush up from her heart. 

'I’ll call. Miss Trusdell.” 

Thank you, Jessie. Clara ought not 
miss a day. I am afraid she is sick. ’ ’ 

So Jessie went around by another path, 
almost afraid to pass Warner’s again. 




It was a cold December day, cloudy now, 
and with the appearance of snow. The 
wind nipped Jessie’s rosy cheeks, but 
she did not mind. Here was the little 
cottage— rather cold and forlorn-looking, 
it must be confessed. Jamie answered 
her tap at the door. 

‘‘Oh! come in. Miss Jessie!” Mrs. 
Adams exclaimed; and Jamie shut the 
door quickly, so the biting air would 
not rush in. 

“I called to see why Clara wasn’t at 
school to-day,” Jessie said. 

Clara blushed. Mrs. Adams looked 
rather troubled. 

“You’re not sick!’ 

“No, Miss Jessie, it wasn’t that. But 
Clara hasn’t any shoes. She would 
freeze her feet in thosfe old ones ; besides 
they’re out to the ground.” 




Jessie cast a furtive glance at them — 
old and shabby, indeed. She thought of 
her own half-worn boots, but although 
Clara was a smaller girl, her feet were 
larger than Jessie’s. No, that would not 
do. 

‘‘I ordered her a pair at Mr. Gregg’s, 
and they ’re done, only he will not let me 
have them until I pay down a little. 
And I’ve just money enough for my rent, 
which is due to-morrow. Mr. Dallas is a 
hard landlord.” 

‘'Then you have all the money?” 
Jessie said, gladly. 

' ‘ Yes, I am thankful for that ; hut Clara 
must wait until next week. I shall have 
to earn some more.” 

Jessie talked to Jamie and Charley 
quite a while, and listened to the praises 
of her own dear mamma, who was always 




doing a kind turn for everybody. And 
a plan came into her mind ; but then she 
could not have a crying doll, nor a paint- 
box, nor any of those charming toys that 
she half coveted. She said good-by to 
them presently, and went straight to Mr. 
Gregg’s. 

A woman in a faded shawl was stand- 
ing by the untidy counter. She had been 
binding some shoes, and brought them 
home. 

can’t give it to you, because I 
haven’t a cent in the place,” Mr. Gregg 
was saying. ‘ ' People won ’t pay me, and 
I can’t pay others.” 

"But we actually haven’t anything in 
the house— not a mouthful of dinner 
even”; and here the poor woman’s 
tremulous voice broke down. 

Jessie felt like crying, too; but she 




winked away the tears with a great 
effort. Then she asked Mr. Gregg about 
Clara 's shoes. 

‘ ' There they are, ’ ' he said, rather 
brusquely, and nodded his head toward 
a stout pair standing on a little shelf. 
‘'Good, strong ones, too, and dirt cheap, 
yet they can’t pay for them. I’m done 
trusting; it’s a poor plan, and keeps me 
like a beggar.” 

Then he hammered spitefully upon 
his lapstone, and looked savage. He was 
a surly old fellow. 

‘‘Will you let her have them if I give 
you a dollar now, and promise to pay 
the rest if they can’t?” Jessie asked, 
bravely. 

“Yes, Miss.” 

Out came Jessie’s dollar. Spent for a 
pair of coarse shoes that had not a bit of 



beauty or grace, like the fairy or the 
doll, or twenty other things. 

The poor woman approached again. 
‘'Oh, Mr. Gregg— 

‘'Well, take it,’' he said, ungraciously. 

The thin fingers clutched it nervously, 
and she almost stared at Jessie. 

‘‘Will you send them down to Mrs. 
Adams, to-night? I'll ask papa for 
the rest of the money. How much is 
it!’'
