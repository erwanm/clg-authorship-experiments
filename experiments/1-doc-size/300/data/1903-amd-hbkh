work light. Besides, I want to guard 
you against selfishness and all its at- 
tendant evils. But I think you have 
learned your lesson pretty well. Like 
Dick, I shall not feel afraid to trust you 
again. ’ ’ 
"If you could only have your pretty 
lace back! Oh, mamma, how can any- 
body—” 
"One sin waits upon another. And 
now, little daughter, we will see how 
much we can help one another in the 
future, and you must believe that I am 
 
always thinking and planning for yonr 
best. ’ ' 
am sure I shall, forever and ever,

warmth and sincerity. 
think you have learned a little about 
the higher housekeeping,’' mamma con- 
tinued, softly,— Keep thy heart.” 
OH, dear!'’ Laura Preston sighed, 
impatiently, ‘'there’s the baby 
awake again ! I do wish I 
could have a little time like the other 
girls! They’re all going to Bell Cum- 
mings’s to play croquet, and I meant to 
ask you if I couldn’t go.” 
Laura’s voice choked over a sob. It 
was hard to stay in the house all this 
beautiful weather, to know what fun the 
girls were having, and she out of it all, 
taking care of this tiresome baby. She 
wished there were no such things as 
babies in the world. Saturday, she had 
to give up Annie Graham’s little tea- 
party; Monday afternoon, she had a 
]oretty book, that had to be returned the 
next day, and he wouldn’t let her read a 
line— here it was Wednesday, and it 
seemed to her that she had done nothing 
but take care of him for the last month. 
‘ ' If you could take him in the carriage 
— he’d he so much better for a change 
in the open air.” 
Mrs. Preston uttered this timidly. 
She was so ill and worn, and looked so 
tired, that, at any other time, her little 
daughter ’s heart would have been moved 
with pity. 
‘‘But I couldn’t go there, and I 
shouldn’t want to; they’d all call me 
nurse-maid. I don’t see why Ann can’t 
find some time to take care of the baby. 
She used to, I ’m sure. ’ ’ 
 
“My being sick has made so muck 
more work, you know/’ 
At this the baby gave a cry. Laura 
jerked him up from the cradle, and then 
he screamed. 
‘'You’re aiittle crosspatch.” 
‘‘Bring him to me,” said her mother. 
Laura felt a little ashamed then, and 
cuddled him up between her face and 
neck, and began to whisper softly to him. 
He was very sleepy, and soon shut his 
eyes. 
“I guess he will go to sleep again,” 
she said, in a gentler tone, and began 
walking up and down the room. Yet all 
the time she was thinking of the bright 
sunshine, and the smooth, velvety lawn 
where the girls were going to play cro- 
quet. 
“ Mother,” she said, presently. 
 
couldn’t we have some one come and 
take care of the baby while you are so 
poorly I There’s Jenny Briggs out of a 
place. ’ ’ 
‘‘Mrs. Sayre said Jenny was very 
careless ; that she wouldn ’t trust her with 
a baby. I think I shall be better 
soon. It is real hard for you; I’m 
sorry. ’ ’ 
Something in her mother’s voice 
touched Laura, but she was not in a 
mood to be very tender. Of course, it 
was hard to have to stay in the house all 
the time, and give up everything. 
She laid the baby back in his crib, and 
gave another longing glance out of the 
window. 
“I think you might go,” her mother 
said, presently; “it’s only four now, and 
if you could be back by a little after five. 
Jamie ouglit to take a good long nap; 
he hasn ’t slept hardly any to-day. ’ ’ 
‘ ' Oh ! I should like to so much. ’ ' 
Laura 's conscience checked her. She 
felt that she ought to stay in the house, 
in case she might be needed; hut there 
was Ann downstairs, and if the baby 
would sleep ! 
‘'Yes, you can go.’' 
Mrs. Preston felt that Laura had been 
confined a great deal lately, and the 
frowning face did not promise very 
pleasant companionship. However, it 
cleared up wonderfully now. 
‘‘Oh! thank you, mamma! Ifil be 
back real early. ' ’ 
Laura ran upstairs, and slipped on her 
white dress. Ann had begged her to 
save it nice for another Sunday, “the 
ruffles were so botherin’ to iron”; but it 
was the very ruffles that she liked. Then 
she gave her hair a brush, tied on her 
blue sash, and went down. She ought 
to go in and kiss poor, pale mamma; 
but then she might wake the baby. So 
she stole softly along, lingering a mo- 
ment on the porch. Was that sound the 
little rascal Jamie waking up again? 
No, she guessed not, and down the walk 
she ran. 
They had played one game when she 
reached Bell’s handsome house. She 
was very glad that she had dressed her- 
self so prettily, for here were Bell’s 
cousins, and Mrs. Cummings and some 
lady visitors were looking on. 
'I’m so glad you’ve come !” exclaimed 
Bell; '‘we had to take that stupid Sarah 
Gaines, who hardly knows a mallet from 
a bean-pole. Now, we’ll have some fun.” 
your day out, I suppose, Laura, 
drawled Bessie Livingston. heard 
that you'd turned child’s nurse.” 
That vexed Laura, and a heat flashed 
to her face. 
take care of my little brother some- 
times,” she said, haughtily; yet she 
wished in her heart that she didn’t have it 
to do. 
"Come, Blue, run to your place!” said 
Bell. 
They all went at it in great earnest. 
Laura was a capital player, generally, 
but this afternoon her hand didn’t seem 
very steady. She lost her patience 
easily; she felt flurried, and nervous, 
and warm, and found she was on the 
losing side. And then there was an un- 
comfortable misgiving tugging at her 
heart. If the baby should wake, if Ann 
was busy or out, and poor mamma did 
look unusually pale! She might have 
guessed that mamma had been worrying 
with the baby all day, when she said he 
had not slept any; but just then she did 
not want to think of any one besides 
herself. And now, she couldn’t help 
thinking, and the balls became confused 
in her mind. 
Until ten months before, Laura Pres- 
ton had been an only child, and, of 
course, indulged a good deal. She 
seemed so sweet and good-tempered al- 
ways, but it was because there had been 
nothing to try her. At first, she pro- 
nounced the baby splendid, and cared for 
nothing else— tended him, caressed him, 
did yards of tatting, crocheted him a 
blanket and a cap, and worked him a 
little skirt. Then her interest began to 
flag; he took so much time, and was 
really a great deal of trouble. 
For the last month, Mrs. Preston had 
been quite poorly, and the baby a greater 
charge. Laura grew tired of him, she 
secretly confessed to herself, though it 
did seem wicked. But it was hard to give 
up every moment. 
Mrs. Preston saw with pain that Laura 
was developing many selfish and un- 
amiable traits. Sometimes she won- 
dered whether it would be best to relieve 
her of all charge of the baby, or perse- 
vere until she had learned one of the hard 
lessons of life, to think of others for 
something besides pleasure. Yet, to do 
Laura justice, she had never been quite 
so cross as on this day. 
She didn’t enjoy the playing half as 
much as she expected. Bell thought she 
wasn’t trying at all, and did not care 
liow slie played, and presently the game 
came to an end. Lanra said she must go 
home, but Bell begged her to come in 
and see her new dresses. 
'‘How beautifully yours is made!” 
Mrs. Cummings said. ‘'Bell, Miss Lang 
must see this waist ; I ’d like one of yours 
puffed in that fashion.” 
So Bell took her into the dressmaker, 
and, somehow, the time passed rapidly. 
The clock struck six. 
‘‘Oh! I must go”; and Laura made a 
fresh start. 
Flying out of the gate, her skirt 
caught, and, in her haste, she couldn’t 
stop, so her beautiful dress, that she 
was so glad of having worn five minutes 
ago, now had a great, unsightly rent 
across one breadth. 
 
Laura uttered a passionate cry, more 
in anger than sorrow. The whole day 
had gone wrong, for that matter; but, 
first, a little girl had not been quite right 
in heart. 
The doctor’s carriage was standing 
before the door. He generally came in 
the morning, and a sudden fear seized 
the child. There was one of the neigh- 
bors with little Jamie in her arms. 
"Oh!” she said; ‘‘mamma—!’’ 
“Hush! dear — mamma is much worse; 
she has been bleeding at the lungs. This 
great baby is altogether too much for 
her; the doctor says she must have a 
nurse. ’ ’ 
Poor Laura! She seemed turning to 
stone. If she had not gone out!— and 
now, if mamma died, it would be all her 
fault. 
 
Jamie held out his dimpled hands with 
a smile. It seemed then as if her heart 
would break. Two hours ago she had 
thought him such a trial, and would have 
felt relieved if there had been no Jamie 
in the world— he loved her so much, too. 
She hid her face in his dress, and wept 
bitterly. 
Don’t cry, dear; she isn’t dangerous. 
I don’t exactly know, but if she keeps 
quiet, and isn ’t worried, she will get well 
again. Poor sister! tell her not to cry, 
Jamie.” 
Jamie patted the soft, curly head, and 
said,' '‘Ta-ta, ” as if he would comfort 
her. But Laura’s heart was so full that 
she ran off to her room, and buried her 
face in the pillow of her own little bed, 
wanting to beg God not to punish her as 
she deserved, but afraid even to pray. 
 
Presently, some one called her; it was 
Ann's voice, and, changing her dress, 
she went to the kitchen. 
‘ ' Oh, Miss Laura ! ’ ’ and Ann stopped, 
as she saw the pale, tear-stained face and 
swollen eyes. 
‘'When was mamma taken so hard?" 
she asked. 
‘‘About an hour ago. The baby's 
been very troublesome all day, and he's 
a heavy lift for a sick woman. I was 
going to ask you to do some errands. Miss 
Laura, but if youdl set the table. I'll
go.’ 
Laura was glad enough to do anything. 
Before she was through, the doctor went 
away, and Mrs. Brown came out with the 
baby. Then Laura heard a quick, 
familiar step. She waited with a beat- 
ing heart; but Ann returned, finished 
preparing the supper, and yet papa had 
not left the room. Baby began to worry, 
and Laura took him. When the dear 
little arms tightened round her neck, 
the quick tears rushed to her eyes 
again. How could she have thought 
him a trouble, and been glad to get 
away ! 
When Mr. Preston came in, he kissed 
Laura and Babie Jamie, asleep on her 
shoulder. She couldn’t eat or hardly 
speak, but listened to Mrs. Brown and 
papa. They didn’t seem to think Mrs. 
Preston so very ill, but Laura really was 
afraid she would die before morning — 
and what if she never kissed her again ! 
Then she remembered how she had 
slipped away in the afternoon, and her
