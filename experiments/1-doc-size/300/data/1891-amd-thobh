 

"N"o, you were not," cries Cynthia incisively. "You 
surely did not tell her that ? " and she stops surprised. 

" She understood at once." 

" You feel that if it had been left to Eegina she would 
have given up our part of the money rather than have 
stirred in a matter likely to make a scandal! Kemember 
she would not have had the right. The money, if it is 
again awarded to us, is mothei-'s. Still, I am glad she 
had no voice in the matter. It is against her traditions 
that any member of a family two centuries old should 
forge a will or appropriate what was not his. Virtues are 
not always handed down in one groove. And I tliink if 
anything, the punishment should be greater. But she has a 
curiously conscientious tenderness for Perdita that will out- 
weigh all other considerations. She almost blames herself 
for the marriage. I think at that time she was endeavor- 
ing to detach Perdita from Jasper. I cannot see that it 
was any one's fault. We all liked him a good deal, but we 
should have taken time to examine into the fitness, the 
suitability, of such a step. Regina had no hand in forward- 
ing it, not as much as I. And I wish she hadn't this morbid 
conscientiousness about things. She ought to be set in a 
great open space where the sun could shine all around her, 
where there wasn't even a swinging bough to make a 
shadow." 

" Yes," laughing softly at the conceit. 

" I am thankful tjjere wasn't any difference of opinion," 
Cynthia appends archly. "As we shall have to depend 
somewhat upon you for an unbiassed rendering of affairs, I 
am glad a sort of friendly understanding has been estab- 
lished. It has always puzzled me that you and Regina, as 
relatives, have been keyed on rather discordant octaves. 
Why, I wonder ? " 

She turns suddenly in her quick way and faces him. 
There is no moon, but the great golden planets are shining 
in their sea of blue. The summer night air is rare and fine, 
— that wonderful transparency in which you can see a leaf 
stir. And his face has in it a sudden tremulous scarlet ; a 





speechless force of questioning, insistent passion lights his 
eyes. 

" Are we — do you think us so very discordant ? Ave 
there no grand thirds and fifths in human lianuonies ? 
Does it not come to be understood after a while ? " 

He is not talking to her. It is a confession to the stars, 
a whispering into the bland airs of the night that they 
alone may carry the sacred knowledge. Like a far flash it 
comes to Cynthia, — this thing she has half-suspected in a 
girlish fashion, doubted because it did not hold in it her 
preconceived elements of love, come to disbelieve in it at 
last, — to fancy him free from any lingering regard. Has 
there been anything more ? 

"Yes," be says with a sudden brusque alternation in 
tone, " are we so very discordant ? " 

It was as if he resented it. Cynthia feels a strong shiver 
seize her in spite of the warm summer air. This knowl- 
edge has come upon her with such an overwhelming force 
that she can only brace herself mentally. Her shattered 
resources do not at first admit of an answer. 

" Nothing is quite hopeless to a man until the end of 
life," he says softly. "And whatever I wanted, what- 
ever point of agreement was worth striving for, I should 
never give up until convinced beyond a peradventure. 
Are we talking nonsense ? " with his wholesome, tender 
laugh. Then he draws her hand just a trifle through his 
arm and they walk on in silence for some minutes. 

"We shall all befriend Perdita," he says presently. 
" She is very young, and I cannot believe this unfortuiiale 
marriage is to blight her whole life. But I would as soon 
place her in the lair of some prowler of the wilderness as 
to send her back to Jasper Bradley. I do not believe he 
will ever ask it. He has made no further effort that I can 
leam. How does he know where she is — whether in want 
or suffering or lying dead somewhere ? " 

The picture of him in his grace and beauty, in his curious 
golden lights, comes up before Cynthia. His devotion to 
his father, his kindly, touching attentions to her mother, 




the many charming theories, half-beliefs, delightful quali- 
ties ; and one other remembrance that touches her sweet 
nature with a kind of acrid temper, — Hegina has preferred 
him to Winterburne, has not hesitated to subtly place the 
latter on that lower round when he should have reigned a 
king. 

" Regina is stirred with profound tenderness for the 
poor little girl," he says in that delicate approval, alrhost 
like a stab to Cynthia. Has no one else been tender ? 

Cynthia is curiously unresponsive. To-night of all 
nights he longs to hear the tender praise, the soft, excusing 
words that fall so readily from the younger's lips. There 
is a vague sense of loss, an uncomprehended disturbance in 
the fine sympathy she has been wont to give. 

" Are you tired ? " he asks presently in that sweet inde- 
scribable tone. " Your steps lag a little. I ought not 
have brought you out. You must not let me blunder so in 
seeking my own pleasure." 

He turns her round. The rest of the talk is about the 
six weeks when he shall have none of the charming home 
life that he declares has spoiled both him and Arinitage. 
Jason Prall and his wife are sitting side by side in the 
starlight on the step of the back porch, — the wanderers 
have come through the garden. Cynthia stares a little 
blindly at these commonplace people, who have cared for 
each other nearly forty years with no wide range of senti- 
ment. 

She looks in at Perdita who is sleeping restlessly with 
one thin arm over her head. Lois sits nodding. Alice is 
in her bed, a white ghost. 

" Come and tell me if you had a nice walk," she says 
cordially, holding out one hand. 

" I believe I was too tired to enjoy it." 

Cynthia's tone is weary, the clasp of her fingers languid. 

" You poor child. I am afraid we haven't half consid- 
ered you, doing double duties everywhere. When we are 
away by ourselves " — 

"Yes." Cynthia gives a feeble little laugh and says 





good-night.- The story that Alice has counted on — she 
can see everything in this sharp second sight, — will never 
be hers to tell. 

Cynthia Hal ford sits by the open window in a wide 
wakefulness she has rarely linown before. It seems as if 
she would never sleep again. Like a picture, the summer 
passes before her, the sweet summer that can never come 
again, the vague beatitude that can have no name. It has 
passed the calm borderland of friendship, it has not reached 
the open sea of love. She is too essentially just to covet 
what belongs to another, she knows now it always belonged 
back in the little parlor, where he used to talk to them 
and watch Regina. She does not understand this involved 
nature, she only knows if so splendid a love as this man 
can give were offered for her acceptance, she would be 
impelled by that mysterious, nameless power to take it. 
She could not even hold him at arm's length while she was 
considering. "Will Kegina ever come to love him as such a 
large, generous nature should be loved ? 

But, after all, that is not what must decide it for her. 
She has seen a splendid possibility — for another woman. 
Whether for good or ill, joy or pain, all his life long he 
will set Eegina above all others. He will be steadfast 
until she puts it out of his power to think of her honorably, 
but as the dead are recalled. She is proud in all her pain 
that it is simply her mistake, that he has uttered no word, 
that he has never held her hand in gentle dalliance, or 
pressed it to his lips. He has been an honorable gentleman. 



 



CHAPTEE XXVI 

BETWEEN WIND AND WAVES 

A SOFT, rainy July day broods over the earth. It has 
that incomparable fragrance out here where the short grass 
and the branching trees drink it in. The hills are toned 
with purple-gray, wrapped in illusory mists that reach up 
to the vague outline of sky. Cynthia iinds it intensely 
comfoiting. She is glad not to have the sunshine. Pres- 
ently she means to go out in it again, for she could not sit 
in the shade any length of time, nor have things blurred, 
like these trees and distant mountains. She cannot barter 
all the warm, bright material values for indefinite, unsatis- 
fying dreams of what might have been, but never was. 
Her brave nature is honest to the core. And she has this 
gift, this one thing Kegina has coveted. Is there some 
curious purpose in all these lines, that seem so crossed and 
tangled ? Regina would ask for nothing outside of it. 
She would gloat over it as a miser over his treasure. 

And here is this other wonderful, beautiful richness ready 
for her to take, to wrap herself in, to wind about her as a 
rare, priceless garment. Cynthia stands amazed that one 
could pass it by unknowingly even. That Regina may 
have refused it does not oven occur to her ; but it will 
always be hers. And they can no more change possessions 
than they can change their natures. The conceit amuses 
her. 

She was late in sleeping, so she has not come down until 
long after Winterburne's departure. Only Lois has been 
there to pour his coffee and give him the unspoken God 
speed to his daily duties. She knows how brightly, how 
-joyfully he will go at thein. Will auy one else ever come 




to appreciate this wide, outflowing nature ? Will not the 
other strive to keep it within bounds, to clip and train and 
thwart its larger uses ? 

Perdita is brought down-stairs in Lois's strong arms, and 
walks about a little. She is restless, and impatient to get 
to Beverly. So far she has expressed only fear concerning 
Jasper, and not the slightest desire to see him. Alice is 
languid, and Cynthia makes an effort to appear like her 
olden self ; but she feels washed out like the day. They 
read a little, they plan a little, and the hours go by. Arm- 
itage comes home with Wiiiterburne. There are some last 
things to consult Cynthia about. A distraught expression 
comes and goes in his face, and lo ! Cynthia's tender interest 
is aroused. There is so much in the wide, varied world ! 

The next day Perdita is taken home to the strange, new 
house she has never seen ; but it holds her more than 
mother, and the restful love she has longed for all these 
weary months. She is safe in the clinging arms ; their 
kisses and tears mingle together. 

Regina is so cheerfully ready with her assistance that 
Cynthia wonders she has never recognized this invaluable 
quality in her before. Then she recalls that the elder has 
always done the planning, and brought about astonishing 
results in her clear, definite, if restricted fashion. It seems 
a little unkind to go away and leave her with all these 
cares and burden's. But Mr. Sayre will be her friendly 
adviser in any stress. 

And at last Eegina Halford is alone with her new duties. 
The journey has tired Perdita ; but the delight and ease 
restore her wonderfully. She has such an appreciative 
listener in Mrs. Halford, such an ardent sympathizer, who 
can be quite as inconsequent as herself. They find hosts 
of charming virtues in Jasper, then they turn to the grave 
and bitter faults. 

" And if I had been wiser and stronger," bewails Perdita. 
"But I was so frightened, and I tried to make myself 
believe it was a dream ; I did, really. I loved him so 
much then. I was only afraid of losing liim, and I thought 



 

I could never live without him. Why, it seems now as 
if I had been bewitched with some horrible spell. Do you 
think he will come for me ? mother, you will not let 
me go ? " and Perdita sobs wildly at the thought. 

Is this the love that less than a year ago gave up home 
and everything for Jasper's sake ! Regina wonders with a 
curl of the lip that is ineffable scorn. And yet, who has 
taught her anything of the personal sacredness of marriage ? 
It comes natural to Regina, as all matters of serious import 
seem to do. But this little butterfly, of whom no one 
expected grave consideration, has made a sad mess of her 
life. How shall she be taught to respect bonds that have 
been so lightly entered into ? for she is still Jasper Brad- 
ley's wife. Regina tries to imagine on what side duty 
would lie if he came and demanded her again. 

Meanwhile, there is the small world of Beverly to face. 
The reopening of the will case is not so far off but that 
people begin to discuss it. The fact has come out that Mr. 
Lane never signed the will ; and there are dozens of wit- 
nesses who can recall now, from some particular circum- 
stance, a very direct corroboration. The theory is the will
