window he looked toward the ranks of the mounds stretching 
across the eastern end from side to side " my parade-ground," 
be called it. And then he would smile at his own fancies, 
draw the curtain, shut out the rain and the night, light his 
lamp, and go to work on the ledgers again. Some of the 



names lingered in his memory ; he felt as if he had known 
the men who bore them, as if they had been boys together, 
and were friends even now although separated for a time. 
"James Marvin, Company B, Fifth Maine. The Fifth Maine 
was in the seven days battle. I say, do you remember that 
retreat down the Quaker church road, and the way Phil Kear 
ney held the rear-guard firm ? " And over the whole seven 
days he wandered with his mute friend, who remembered 
everything and everybody in the most satisfactory way. One 
of the little head-boards in the parade-ground attracted him 

peculiarly because the name inscribed was his own : " 

Rodman, Company A, One Hundred and Sixth New York." 

" I remember that regiment ; it came from the extreme 
northern part of the State. Blank Rodman must have melted 
down here, coming as he did from the half-arctic region along 
the St. Lawrence. I wonder what he thought of the first hot 
day, say in South Carolina, along those simmering rice-fields ? " 
He grew into the habit of pausing for a moment by the side 
of this grave every morning and evening. " Blank Rodman. 
It might easily have been John. And then, where should I
be?" 

But Blank Rodman remained silent, and the keeper, after 
pulling up a weed or two and trimming the grass over his 
relative, went off to his duties again. " I am convinced that 
Blank is a relative," he said to himself; "distant, perhaps, 
but still a kinsman." 

One April day the heat was almost insupportable ; but the 
sun's rays were not those brazen beams that sometimes in 
Northern cities burn the air and scorch the pavements to a 
white heat ; rather were they soft and still ; the moist earth 
exhaled her richness, not a leaf stirred, and the whole level 
country seemed sitting in a hot vapor-bath. In the early 
dawn the keeper had performed his outdoor tasks, but all day 
he remained almost without stirring in his chair between two 
windows, striving to exist. At high noon out came a little 
black bringing his supplies from the town, whistling and shuffling 
along, gay as a lark. The keeper watched him coming 
slowly down the white road, loitering by the way in the hot 
blaze, stopping to turn a somersault or two, to dangle over a 
bridge rail, to execute various impromptu capers all by him 
self. He reached the gate at last, entered, and, having come all 
the way up the path in a hornpipe step, he set down his basket 
at the door to indulge in one long and final double-shuffle 
before knocking. " Stop that ! " said the keeper through the 
closed blinds. The little darkey darted back ; but as nothing 
further came out of the window a boot, for instance, or some 
other stray missile he took courage, showed his ivories, and 
drew near again. " Do you suppose I am going to have you 
stirring up the heat in that way ? " demanded the keeper. 

The little black grinned, but made no reply, unless smooth 
ing the hot white sand with his black toes could be construed 
as such ; he now removed his rimless hat and made a bow. 

" Is it, or is it not warm ? " asked the keeper, as a natural 
ist might inquire of a salamander, not referring to his own so 
much as to the salamander's ideas on the subject. 

" Dunno, mars ," replied the little black. 

" How Aoyoit feel ? " 

" Spects I feel all right, mars ." 

The keeper gave up the investigation, and presented to 
the salamander a nickel cent. " I suppose there is no such 
thing as a cool spring in all this melting country," he said. 

But the salamander indicated with his thumb a clump of 
trees on the green plain north of the cemetery. " Ole Mars 
Ward's place cole spring dah." He then departed, breaking 
into a run after he had passed the gate, his ample mouth 
watering at the thought of a certain chunk of taffy at the 
mercantile establishment kept by Aunt Dinah in a corner of 
her one-roomed cabin. At sunset the keeper went thirstily 
out with a tin pail on his arm, in search of the cold spring. 
"If it could only be like the spring down under the rocks 
where I used to drink when I was a boy ! " he thought. He 
had never walked in that direction before. Indeed, now that 

he had abandoned the town, he seldom went beyond the walls 
of the cemetery. An old road led across to the clump of 
trees, through fields run to waste, and following it he came to 
the place, a deserted house with tumble-down fences and 
overgrown garden, the out-buildings indicating that once upon 
a time there were many servants and a prosperous master. 
The house was of wood, large on the ground, with encircling 
piazzas ; across the front door rough bars had been nailed, 
and the closed blinds were protected in the same manner; 
from long want of paint the clapboards were gray and mossy, 
and the floor of the piazza had fallen in here and there from 
decay. The keeper decided that his cemetery was a much 
more cheerful place than this, and then he looked around for 
the spring. Behind the house the ground sloped down ; it 
must be there. He went around and came suddenly upon a 
man lying on an old rug outside of a back door. " Excuse 
me. I thought nobody lived here," he said. 

" Nobody does," replied the man ; " I am not much of a 
body, am I ? " 

His left arm was gone, and his face was thin and worn 
with long illness ; he closed his eyes after speaking, as though 
the few words had exhausted him. 

" I came for water from a cold spring you have here, some 
where," pursued the keeper, contemplating the wreck before 
him with the interest of one who has himself been severely 
wounded and knows the long, weary pain. The man waved 
his hand toward the slope without unclosing his eyes, and 
Rodman went off with his pail and found a little shady hol 
low, once curbed and paved with white pebbles, but now 
neglected, like all the place. The water was cold, however, 
deliciously cold. He filled his pail and thought that perhaps 
after all he would exert himself to make coffee, now that the 
sun was down ; it would taste better made of this cold water. 
When he came up the slope the man's eyes were open. 

" Have some water? " asked Rodman. 

" Yes ; there's a gourd inside." 


The keeper entered, and found himself in a large, bare 
room ; in one corner was some straw covered with an old 
counterpane, in another a table and chair ; a kettle hung in 
the deep fireplace, and a few dishes stood on a shelf ; by the 
door on a nail hung a gourd ; he filled it and gave it to the 
host of this desolate abode. The man drank with eagerness. 

" Pomp has gone to town," he said, " and I could not get 
down to the spring to-day, I have had so much pain." 

" And when will Pomp return ? " 

" He should be here now ; he is very late to-night." 

" Can I get you anything ? " 

" No, thank you ; he will soon be here." 

The keeper looked out over the waste ; there was no one 
in sight. He was not a man of any especial kindliness he 
had himself been too hardly treated in life for that but he 
could not find it in his heart to leave this helpless creature all 
alone with night so near. So he sat down on the door-step. 
" I will rest awhile," he said, not asking but announcing it. 
The man had turned away and closed his eyes again, and 
they both remained silent, busy with their own thoughts ; for 
each had recognized the ex-soldier, Northern and Southern, in 
portions of the old uniforms, and in the accent. The war 
and its memories were still very near to the maimed, poverty- 
stricken Confederate ; and the other knew that they were, and 
did not obtrude himself. 

Twilight fell, and no one came. 

" Let me get you something," said Rodman; for the face 
looked ghastly as the fever abated. The other refused. 
Darkness came ; still, no one. 

" Look here," said Rodman, rising, " I have been wounded 
myself, was in hospital for months ; I know how you feel. 
You must have food a cup of tea, now, and a slice of toast, 
brown and thin." 

" I have not tasted tea or wheaten bread for weeks," an 
swered the man ; his voice died off into a wail, as though 
feebleness and pain had drawn the cry from him in spite of 




himself. Rodman lighted a match ; there was no candle, 
only a piece of pitch-pine stuck in an iron socket on the 
wall ; he set fire to this primitive torch and looked around. 

" There is nothing there," said the man outside, making 
an effort to speak carelessly ; " my servant went to town for 
supplies. Do not trouble yourself to wait ; he will come pres 
ently, and and I want nothing." 

But Rodman saw through proud poverty's lie ; he knew 
that irregular quavering of the voice, and that trembling of 
the hand ; the poor fellow had but one to tremble. He con 
tinued his search ; but the bare room gave back nothing, not 
a crumb. 

" Well, if you are not hungry," he said, briskly, " I am, 
hungry as a bear; and I'll tell you what I am going to do. I 
live not far from here, and I live all alone too ; I haven't a 
servant as you have. Let me take supper here with you, just 
for a change ; and, if your servant comes, so much the better, 
he can wait upon us. I'll run over and bring back the 
things." 

He was gone without waiting for reply; the shattered 
ankle made good time over the waste, and soon returned, 
limping a little, but bravely hasting, while on a tray came the 
keeper's best supplies, Irish potatoes, corned beef, wheaten 
bread, butter, and coffee ; for he would not eat the hot bis 
cuits, the corn-cake, the bacon and hominy of the country, 
and constantly made little New England meals for himself in 
his prejudiced little kitchen. The pine-torch flared in the 
doorway; a breeze had come down from the far mountains 
and cooled the air. Rodman kindled a fire on the cavernous 
hearth, filled the kettle, found a saucepan, and commenced 
operations, while the other lay outside and watched every 
movement in the lighted room. 

" All ready ; let me help you in. Here we are now ; fried 
potatoes, cold beef, mustard, toast, butter, and tea. Eat, 
man ; and the next time I am laid up you shall come over and 
cook for me." 


Hunger conquered, and the other ate, ate as he had not 
eaten for months. As he was finishing a second cup of tea, 
a slow step came around the house ; it was the missing Pomp, 
an old negro, bent and shriveled, who carried a bag of meal 
and some bacon in his basket. " That is what they live on," 
thought the keeper. 

He took leave without more words. " I suppose now I 
can be allowed to go home in peace," he grumbled to con 
science. The negro followed him across what was once the 
lawn. " Fin Mars Ward mighty low," he said apologeti 
cally, as he swung open the gate which still hung between its 
posts, although the fence was down, " but I hurred and hurred 
as fas as I could ; it's mighty fur to de town. Proud to see 
you, sah ; hope you'll come again. Fine fambly, de Wards, 
sah, befo de war." 

" How long has he been in this state ? " asked the keeper. 

" Ever sence one ob de las battles, sah ; but he's worse 
sence we come yer, bout a mont back." 

" Who owns the house ? Is there no one to see to him ? 
has he no friends ? " 

" House b long to Mars Ward's uncle ; fine place once, 
befo de war ; he's dead now, and dah's nobuddy but Miss 
Bettina, an she's gone off somewhuz. Propah place, sah, fur 
Mars Ward own uncle's house," said the old slave, loyally 
striving to maintain the family dignity even then. 

" Are there no better rooms no furniture ? " 

" Sartin ; but but Miss Bettina, she took de keys ; she 
didn't know we was comin " 

" You had better send for Miss Bettina, I think," said the 
keeper, starting homeward with his tray, washing his hands, 
as it were, of any future responsibility in the affair. 

The next day he worked in his garden, for clouds veiled 
the sun and exercise was possible ; but, nevertheless, he could 
not forget the white face on the old rug. " Pshaw ! " he said 
to himself, " haven't I seen tumble-down old houses and bat 
tered human beings before this ? " 


At evening came a violent thunderstorm, and the splendor 
of the heavens was terrible. " We have chained you, 
mighty spirit," thought the keeper as he watched the light 
ning, " and some time we shall learn the laws of the winds 
and foretell the storms ; then, prayers will no more be offered 
in churches to alter the weather than they would be offered 
now to alter an eclipse. Yet back of the lightning and the 
wind lies the power of the great Creator, just the same." 

But still into his musings crept, with shadowy persistence, 
the white face on the rug. 

" Nonsense ! " he exclaimed ; " if white faces are going 
around as ghosts, how about the fourteen thousand white 
faces that went under the sod down yonder ? If they could 
arise and walk, the whole State would be filled and no more 
carpet-baggers needed." So, having balanced the one with 
the fourteen thousand, he went to bed. 

Daylight brought rain still, soft, gray rain; the next 
morning showed the same, and the third likewise, the nights 
keeping up their part with low-down clouds and steady pat 
tering on the roof. " If there was a river here, we should 
have a flood," thought the keeper, drumming idly on his win
