and rocks burst high into the air 
with a thunderous explosion; after 
a little there was a shower of descending 
stones; then all was serene 
again. 
"I wish to God you'd been in itl'' 
remarked the master. 
They went down the shaft, cleaned 
it out, drilled another hole, and put 
in another charge. 
Timing "Look herel How much fuse are 
fuse yo proposing to waste? Don't you 
know how to time a fuse?" 
"No, sir." 
"You don't! Well, if you don't 
beat anything I ever saw!" 
He climbed out of the shaft and 
spoke down: 
" Well, idiot, are you going to be all 
day? Cut the fuse and Hght it!" 
The trembling creature began, 
"If you please, sir, I — " 
" You talk back to me ? Cut it and 
light it!" 
The boy cut and lit. 
"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! 
I wish you were in — " 
In his rage he snatched the ladder 
out of the shaft and ran. The boy 
was aghast. 
"Oh, my God! Help! Help! Oh, 
save me!" he implored. "Oh, what 
can I do! What can I do!" 
He backed against the wall as 
tightly as he could; the sputtering 
fuse frightened the voice out of him; 
his breath stood still; he stood gazing 
and impotent; in two seconds, three 
seconds, four, he would be flying se to 
death 
toward the sky torn to fragments. 
Then he had an inspiration. He 
sprang at the fuse and severed the 
inch of it that was left above ground, 
and was saved. 
He sank down limp and half life- 
less with fright, his strength all 
gone; but he muttered with a deep 
joy: 
"He has learnt me! I knew there 
fa,.   way, if I would wait' 
After a matter of five minutes Buck- 
ner stole to the shaft, looking wor- 
ried and uneasy, and peered down 
into it. He took in the situation; he 
saw what had happened. He low- 
ered the ladder, and the boy dragged 
himself weakly up it. He was very 
white. His appearance added some- 
thing to Buckner's uncomfortable 
regret and sympathy which sat upon 
him awkwardly from lack of prac- 
tice: 
"It was an accident, you know. 
Don't say anything about it to any- 
body ; I was excited, and didn't notice 
what I was doing. You're not look- 
ing well; you've worked enough for 
to-day ; go down to my cabin and eat 
what you want, and rest. It's just 
an accident, you know, on account 
of my being excited." 
"It scared me' said the lad, as he ' 
started away; "but I learnt something,
so I don't mind it." 
"Damned easy to please!" muttered 
Buckner, following him with his eye. 
"I wonder if he'll tell? Mightn't 
he? ... I wish it had killed him." 
The boy took no advantage of 
his holiday in the matter of rest- 
Fggf ing; he employed it in work, eager 
. and feverish and happy work. A 
thick growth of chaparral extended 
down the mountain - side clear to 
Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's 
labor was done in the dark intrica- 
cies of that stubborn growth ; the rest 
of it was done in his own shanty. 
At last all was complete, and he 
said: 
"If he's got any suspicions that 
I'm going to tell on him, he won't 
keep them long, to-morrow. He will 
see that I am the same milksop as I 
always was — all day and the next. 
And the day after to-morrow night 
there'll be an end of him, and nobody 
will ever guess who finished him up 
nor how it was done. He dropped 
me the idea his own self, and that's 
odd." 
HE next day came and 
went. 
It is now almost mid- 
night, and in five min- 
utes the new morning will begin. The 
scene is in the tavern billiard-room. 
Rough men in rough clothing, slouch 
hats, breeches stuffed into boot-tops, 
some with vests, none with coats, are 
grouped about the boiler -iron stove, 
which has ruddy cheeks and is dis- 
tributing a grateful warmth ; the bill- 
iard-balls are clacking; there is no 
other sound — that is, within ; the wind 
is fitfully moaning without. The men 
look bored; also expectant. A hulk- 
ing, broad-shouldered miner, of mid- 
dle age, with grizzled whiskers, and 
an unfriendly eye set in an imsociable 
face, rises, slips a coil of fuse upon 
his arm, gathers up some other per- 
sonal properties, and departs without 
word or greeting to anybody. It is 
Flint Buckner. As the door closes 
behind him a buzz of talk breaks 
out. 
"The regularest man that ever 
was,'' said Jake Parker, the black- method 
smith ; *" you can tell when it's twelve 
just by him leaving, without looking 
at your Waterbury." 
"And it's the only virtue he's got, 
as fur as I know' said Peter Hawes, 
miner. 
" He's just a blight on this society' 
on society said _ Wells - Far go's man, Ferguson 
" If I was running this shop I'd make 
him say something, some time or 
other, or vamos the ranch." This 
with a suggestive glance at the bar- 
keeper, who did not choose to see it, 
since the man under discussion was 
a good customer, and went home 
pretty well set up, every night, with 
refreshments furnished from the bar. 
"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, 
"does any of you boys ever recollect 
of him asking you to take a drink?" 
''Him? Flint Buckner? Oh, 
Laura!" 
This sarcastic rejoinder came in a 
spontaneous general outburst in one 
form of words or another from the 
crowd. After a brief silence, Pat 
Riley, miner, said: 
"He's the 15 -puzzle, that cuss. The 
And his boy's another one. I can't puzzle 
make them out." 
"Nor anybody else," said Ham 
Sandwich; "and if they are 15-puzzles,
how are you going to rank up 
that other one? When it comes to 
A I right-down solid mysteriousness, 
he laj's over both of them. Easy — 
don't he?" 
"You bet!" 
Everybody said it. Every man but 
one. He was the new-comer — Pe- 
terson. He ordered the drinks all 
round, and asked who No. 3 might 
be. All answered at once, ''Archy 
Stillman!'' 
"Is he a mystery?'' asked Peter- 
"Is te a mystery? Is Archy Still- 
man a mystery?'' said Wells-Fargo's 
man, Ferguson. "Why, the fourth 
dimension's foolishness to him." 
For Ferguson was learned. 
Peterson wanted to hear all about 
him; everybody wanted to tell him; 
everybody began. But Billy Stevens, 
the barkeeper, called the house to or- 
der, and said one at a time was best. 
He distributed the drinks, and ap- 
pointed Ferguson to lead. Fergu- 
son said: 
"Well, he's a boy. And that is 
just about all we know about him. 
You can pump him till you are tired; 
it ain't any use; you won't get any- 
thing. At least about his intentions, 
or line of business, or where he's 
from, and such things as that. And 
as for getting at the nature and get- 
up of his main big chief mystery, 
why, he'll just change the subject, 
that's all. You can gtiess till you're 
black in the face— it's your privilege 
— but suppose you do, where do you 
arrive at ? Nowhere, as near as I 
can make out." 
" What is his big chief one?" 
"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. 
Instinct, maybe. Magic, maybe. Take 
your choice — grown-ups, twenty-five; 
children and servants, half price. Now 
I'll tell you what he can do. You 
can start here, and just disappear; 
hide y  S< ad hide wherever you 
'? want to, I don't care where it is, nor 
how far — and he'll go straight and 
put his finger on you." 
'You don't mean it!" 
'' I just do, though. Weather's noth- 
ing to him — elemental conditions is 
nothing to him — he don't even take 
notice of them." 
"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? 
Hey?" 
"It's all the same to him. He 
don't give a damn." 
"Oh, 503;— including fog, per'aps?" 
" Fog I he's got an eye 't can plunk 
through it like a bullet." 
"Now, boys, honor bright, what's 
he giving me?" 
"It's a fact I" they all shouted. 
''Go on, Weils-Fargo." 
"Well, sir, you can leave him here, 
chatting with the boys, and you can 
slip out and go to any cabin in this 
camp and open a book — yes, sir, 
a dozen of them — and take the page 
in your memory, and he'll start out 
and go straight to that cabin and 
open every one of them books at the 
right page, and call it ofiF, and never 
make a mistake." 
" He must be the devil !"  
"More than one has thought it. " 
Now ril tell you a perfectly wonder- 
ful thing that he done. The other 
night he—" 
There was a sudden great murmur 
of sounds outside, the door flew open, 
and an excited crowd burst in, with 
the camp's one white woman in the 
lead and crying: 
"My child! my child! she's lost 
l  and gone! For the love of God help 
'" me to find Archy Stillman; weVe 
himted everywhere!" 
Said the barkeeper: 
''Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, 
and don't worry. He asked for a 
bed three hours ago, tuckered out 
tramping the trails the way he's al- 
ways doing, and went up stairs. Ham 
Sandwich, run up and roust him out; 
he's in No. 14." 
The youth was soon downstairs 
and ready. He asked Mrs. Hogan 
for particulars. 
''Bless you, dear, there ain't any; 
I wish there was. I put her to sleep 
at seven in the evening, and when I 
went in there an hour ago to go to bed
myself, she was gone. I rushed for 
your cabin, dear, and you wasn't 
there, and Tve hunted for you ever 
since, at every cabin down the gulch, 
and now Tve come up again, and 
Fm that distracted and scared and 
heart-broke; but, thanks to God, Tve 
found you at last, dear heart, and 
you'll find my child. Come on I come 
quick !'' 
"Move right along; Fm with you, 
madam. Go to your cabin first." 
The whole company streamed out 
to join the hunt. All the southern 
half of the village was up, a hundred 
men strong, and waiting outside, a 
vague dark mass sprinkled with twin- 
kling lanterns. The mass fell into 
columns by threes and fours to ac- 
commodate itself to the narrow road, 
and strode briskly along southward 
in the wake of the leaders. In a 
few minutes the Hogan cabin was 
reached. 
"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Ho- 
gan; "there's where she was; it's 
where I laid her at seven o'clock; but 
where she is now, God only knows." 
" Hand me a lantern," said Archy. 
He set it on the hard earth floor 
and knelt by it, pretending to exam-
