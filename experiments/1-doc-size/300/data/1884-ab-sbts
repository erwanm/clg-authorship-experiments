by a spectral sort of light ; nobody looks at him, except 
perhaps the servant-girls and coachmen in the gallery. 
Every eye is on Hamlet." 

" And is he pale and frightened ? Please go on." 

"That depends on your actor," said Oswald, enter- 
ing into the boy's interest and seeing that he need not 
bring the subject down to a tale for his amusement ; 
"he may be all bravado ; a solid, beef-eating Hamlet, 
who would track a ghost to earth as quickly and with 



as much relish as he would a fox. He may be only 
an actor who has learned to mouth the part, but is 
not student enough to spend years in dissecting it, 
and he will fall into an abject terror. But once in 
two or three life-times, you may find a man who has 
such power of sympathy as to put himself into Hamlet's 
frame of mind ; and if his own mind is fine enough, 
his emotions sensitive in response, his conscience 
abnormally developed, and his will unequal to any 
steady strain upon it, that man may come near to an 
understanding of Hamlet. Then, if he have a res- 
pectable figure, and a nose that is not a snub, a severe 
theatrical training, and a vivid talent, perhaps he may 
venture to play the part." 

Half of this was over the head of Philip, but he did 
not like it the less for that ; more than most of us ob- 
ject to scientific nomenclature which possibly leaves 
no very clear impression on the mind. 

' Is it very hard to get a play accepted ? " asked 
Philip in a voice that sounded unnatural to himself ; 
it seemed to him it must publish to the world the fact 
of his dear ambition. 

" Oh yes," said Oswald, so carelessly that the lad 
felt a real surprise that he evidently had not seen the 
personal drift of the question ; ' unless one has in- 
fluence at court, or enough talent to write a sensational 
play that would take with the multitude and run for 
the season. He might understand stage management 
well enough to get up scenic effects and produce one 
of those brilliant plays that have enough noise and 
thunder for the ear, and blue and green lights for the 
eye, to be popular. But who wants popularity? All 





this is clap-trap, you know ; if you come to real play- 
writing, that is another thing." 

" Another thing because it would be so hard to do ?" 
asked Philip, with almost hurt emphasis. ' But if one 
wanted it more than any thing else ; so much that he 
would be willing to wait a long while to be known ?" 

" Well, he might have all that without any brains," 
said Oswald carelessly, taking up the oars ; ' brains 
do count, after all, you know. I believe I'll row in 
shore. How good that gingerbread was ! Your mother 
or was it the sister ? was very thoughtful." 

Philip sat silent all the way in ; like many conscious, 
sensitive people, he was easily wounded on the score 
of his personal wishes and plans. Elizabeth was the 
only one to whom he had ever spoken of them, and 
she always believed in him. This was the first doubt 
that had ever entered his world of visions. Oswald 
noticed the change in him. 

" If you are willing, I'll leave you at the Point and 
take the boat round," said Philip ; he had his own 
reasons for wishing it. 

" Just as you like. Shall I give you the money to 
pay the man, or will he let us take it again and pay for 
it all together ? ' 

" That would be the best way," said Philip ; he had 
no intention of braving the probably irate Si, so far as 
to offer him money to pay for the trick. Oswald 
could do that for himself, if he chose. 

" I shall see you again," said the young man. ''Come 
in and sit by my fire with me. I've had roaring ones 
made in two or three rooms of that old house. Come 
in and keep me company." 



 

" I should like to," Philip said, forgetting his de- 
pression of the past minutes in the prospect of longer 
talks with the stranger. ' I will if I can." 

Oswald left him at the Point, and he, looking back 
as he rowed away, saw the well-knit figure fast disap- 
pearing over the rocks, the gun over the shoulder 
picturesquely outlined against the sky. 

Fortunately, no one was down by the shore when 
Philip drew up the boat. He was rather glad, not 
because he shrank from confession, but he was cold 
and tired, and the joke did not seem quite as funny as 
it had done. By the time he reached home he was 
quite chilled, and thought of the kitchen fire with 
more interest than of any thing else. 

No one was there when he went in, but as things 
were all in order in the room and the clock ticking 
soberly, sole watch .over the scene, he knew that, the 
work being done till dinner-time, the three women 
were busy in the next room. 

It makes one tired, both mentally and physically, to 
think of the hours they spent sewing or knitting, day 
after day and month after month, in an unbroken 
silence. It is to be questioned whether the mind 
does not lull itself to sleep in such monotonous 
pricking of the needle, as the bodily eyes close in 
weariness after fastening themselves on one uninter- 
esting object after another. 






CHAPTER IV. 

OSWALD spent his day at the Sea View where, after 
eating a dinner especially adapted to the place, con- 
sisting chiefly of fish-chowder, he took his seat by the 
fire and talked with one after another of the men who 
dropped in to smoke. They interested him warmly, and 
he was so talkative and conciliatory in hope of drawing 
out their own originality, that after he was gone there 
were strong beliefs expressed that he was a politician, 
who had an ax to grind. 

' Why," said a bent and grizzled figure in a blue 
jacket, Charlie .Reeves, an old man who seemed to 
have retained the boyish diminutive of his name chief- 
ly on account of its inappropriateness, " you remem- 
ber when Josh Rowe was murdered in his cider-house ? 
Twenty year ago it was, but there ain't a man in 
Stra'ford that hain't had the particulars of the story 
told him. There warn't a clue to the murderer, you 
know, and jest at that time there come down to this 
very tavern, boys," bringing his brawny hand down on 
a chair to emphasize the reality of its being the identi- 
cal furniture that was there twenty years ago, " to this 
very tavern, a slim, slick young chap ; butter wouldn't 
melt in his mouth. The fust Sunday he was here, he 
went to meetin' and set in Elder Fry's Bible-class. 
Talked with every body, he did ; talked with me ! 



 

Said he was interested in murders ; wanted to know 
all about it; and if you'd believe it, when I told him all 
I knew, he'd set and shiver ! Wai, he staid round 
here ten days, talkin' to one and another, and most of 
all with Bill Holmes ; and then, one day, we was set- 
tin' here, right here in this keepin'-room, boys, and 
Bill Holmes come in and sez, kinder reckless, as if he 
thought best for folks "re hear him, ' Give me a glass 
o' whisky, old man, I'm goin' up to Boston on the ten 
o'clock train,' and before any one could ask a question, 
' So you are ! ' sez a voice like the snap of a whip. We 
all jumped an' turned round, an' there, where we 
thought he was settin', stewin' over the fire an' askin' 
questions in that low voice of his, was the stranger ; 
he was standin' straight as a gun-barrel, and you'd a 
thought he'd grown six inches. ' Yes, you shall,' sez 
he, ez cool ez you be now, ' and I'll go with you.' An' 
with that he walked up an' slipped a pair o' hand-cuffs 
on Bill's wrists. Bill cow'd down an' never said a 
-irvord ; an' in the spring he was convicted of murder 
in the fust degree. You see, boys, the feller was a 
detective, and he had come down here o' purpose to 
ketch him. Now this one goes on talkin' jest ez he 
did, and don't seem to have no more business on his 
hands." 

Here Charlie paused and looked with cool triumph 
into the fire, as if he had proved his case conclusively 
but was too modest to look up for applause. The 
circle of men had gone on smoking gravely, giving 
confirmatory nods at certain points of the story. They 
had heard it more times than it would be well to esti- 
mate, though not as illustrative of this particular per- 



 

son, but no one gave a sign of impatience at the last 
recital. 

Next spoke Jim Bolton, a good-natured young fel- 
low, who managed to be very happy with his wife and 
six children in a house of two rooms, and bore with 
the most beaming good-humor the epithet ' shiftless," 
applied in no very severe rey >\ach, but as the result 
of criticism by the town in general. 

" Must ha' been a politician after office," he said, 
knocking the ashes of his pipe into the saw-dust bed 
in which the stove was set ; " never had a stranger 
make me talk about myself as he did, except Emmitt, 
when he wanted to be senator. Kept holt o' my hand 
ten minutes, Emmitt did, askin' how my family was, 
before I got a chance to answer him." 

" What did you tell him, Jim ?'' asked a youth of 
nineteen, who felt highly honored at being admitted to 
this conclave, and who knew, as did all the rest, the 
coming answer. 

" Told him I was much obliged for his int'rest, and 
that my wife and child'en was all down with the^small- 
pox. Lord ! how quick he dropped my hand and 
skulked off," and Jim's voice broke into a ripple of 
laughter. 

A smile passed round the circle ; an old story was 
as good as a new one in fact, rather better ; it was 
more in harmony with the current of Stratford life ; a 
new and startling recital would have been like a 
heavy stone thrown into the calm waters, making waves 
instead of ripples. 

But one man had an interest in making Oswald's 
acquaintance." Si had intended to use his boat him- 



 

self, that morning, and had gone to the shore only to 
look for it in vain. Great was his astonishment when 
Jim, who he supposed had borrowed it, came down for 
that very purpose, and it was not until some gunner 
solved the mystery by saying he had seen the stranger 
out in it, that the wonder ceased. Si waited to see it 
brought in and give the stranger a decided expression 
of his opinion. He was of that easy nature which 
could forgive almost any dereliction for weeks, and 
then when it happened to impress itself on his mind, 
would suddenly pounce upon the offender. 

He watched for the boat's coming in, but a 
friend with a bunch of brant and teal over his 
shoulder, big enough to make any sportsman's eyes 
water, passed through his back yard and stopped 
to talk ; and Si, forgetting his resolve in the excite- 
ment of telling his grievance, was deeply absorbed 
at the very moment when Philip was drawing up the 
boat and running home across the rocks. When Si, 
taking his foot down from the saw-horse and his hand 
from his knee, had finished his narrative, he found, to 
his surprise, the boat in its place. But the sturdy sea- 
man had a strict sense of justice and was not to be balk- 
ed of his purpose ; so, learning that Oswald was at the 
farm, he took his way there, saying nothing to the men 
who inquired about the loss of his boat. The house 
was quite dark, as he approached, save for a glow of 
ruddy fire-light playing across the small window-panes. 
Si knocked, and after waiting a suitable time for an 
answer, walked into one of the large, square rooms 
opening from the hall. 

' Come in," said the voice of the young stranger, 
lazily. " I don't know who you are, but you're wel- 
come.' 



After the moment necessary to accustom his eyes to 
the gloom, Si could see the young man's figure, stretch- 
ed on a buffalo-robe before the roaring fire. The old 
house, left untenanted for so many years, had not 
known a fire for so long that it must have been quite 
shaken on its foundations with enthusiasm, at the roar up 
the wide chimney and the tongues of ambitious flame. 
Si seated himself gravely on a straight-backed chair 
near the door. " I come to ask you about usin' my 
boat this mornin'," he said, every word pointed and 
emphasized to the young man's ears by the broadness 
of the vowels and the rolling of the " r " s. Oswald
