years that Tiberius ruled in Rome, 
his wisdom, moderation, modesty and 
impartiality were recognized and attested. The Tiber overflowed, the 
senate looked for a remedy in the Sibyline Books. Tiberius set some eru.
gineers to work. A citizen swore by 
Augustus and swore falsely. The sen- 
ate sought to punish him, not for per- 
jury but for sacrilege. It is for Au-
gustus to punish, said Tiberius. The  
senate wanted to name a month after I
him. Tiberius declined. "Suppos- 
ing I were the thirteenth Caesar, what  
would you do ?" For years he reigned,  
popular and acclaimed, caring the I 
while nothing for popularity and less  
for pomp. Sagacious, witty even, believe  perhaps in little eise than fate  



 



and mathematics, yet maintaining the 
institutions of the land, striving resolutely for the best, outwardly impassible and inwardly mobile, he was a 
man and his patience had bounds. 
There were conspirators in the atrium, 
there was death in the courtier's 
smile; and finding his favorites false, 
his life threatened, danger at every 
turn, his conception of rulership 
changed. Where moderation had 
been suddenly there gleamed the axe. 
Tacitus, always dramatic, states 
that at the time terror dcvasted the 
citj". It so happened that under the 
republic there was a law against 
whomso diminished the majesty of 
the people. The republic was a god, 
one that had its temple, its priests, its 
altars. When the republic succumbed, its divinity passed to the 
emperor; he became Jupiter's peer, 
and, as such, possessed of a majesty 





which it was sacrilege to slight. 
Consulted on the subject, Tiberius 
replied that the law must be observed. 
Originally instituted in prevention of 
offenses against the public good, it 
was found to ciiange into a crime, a 
word, a gesture or a look. It was a 
crime to undress before a statue of 
Augustus, to mention his name in the 
latrinfe, to carry a coin with his image 
into a lupanar. The punishment was 
death. Of the property of the 
accused, a third went to the informer, 
the rest to the state. Then abruptly 
terror stalked abroad. No one was 
safe except the obscure, and it was the 
obscure that aLXused. Once an 
accused accused his accuser; the 
latter went mad. There was but one 
refuge — the tomb. If the accused had 
time to kill himself before he was 
tried, his property was safe from 
seizure and his corpse from disgrace. 








Suicide became endemic in Rome. 
Never among the rich were orgies as 
frenetic as then. There was a breathless chase after delights, which the 
summons, "It is time to die," might 
at any moment interrupt. 

Tiberius meanwhile had gone from 
Rome. It was then his legend began. 
He was represented living at Capri 
in a collection of twelve villas, each 
of which was dedicated to a particular form of lust, and there with the 
paintings of Parrhasius for stimulant 
the satyr lounged. He was then an old 
man; his life had been passed in public, his morals unreproved. If no one 
becomes suddenly base, it is rare for 
a man of seventy to become abruptly 
vile. "Whoso," Sakya Muni an- 
nounced — "whoso discovers that grief 
comes from affection, will retire into the 
jungles and there remain," Tiberius 
had made the discovery. The jungles 







 



he selected were the gardens by the 
sea. And in those gardens, gossip 
represented him devising new forms 
of old vice. On the subject every 
doubt is permissible, and even otherwise, morality then existed in but one 
form, one which the entire nation 
observed, wholly, absolutely, and with 
all its soul; that form was patriotism- 
Chastity was expected of the vestal, 
but of no one else. The matrons had 
certain traditions to maintain, certain 
appearances to preserve, but otherwise everybody was free enough, and 
that everybody made use of that 
freedom, the law Pappea Poppcea 
attests. 

In those days matrimony was not 
as frequent as it has since become. 
When it occurred, divorce was its 
natural consequence. Incompatibility 
was sufficient cause. Cicero, who has 
given it to history that the by




women counted the years not numerically, but by their different husbands, 
obtained a divorce on the ground that 
his wife did not idoHze him. Many 
a man on his return from a journey 
discovered that the lad}- he had left at 
the head of his house had obtained a 
divorce in his absence. According 
to Plutarch, a gentleman, Ilortensius 
by name, became enamored of 
Cato's daughter, Portia, then the wife 
of Bibulus, and begged Cato to hand 
her over to him. Cato refused, alleging that Portia was in love with her 
husband. At this, Hortensins, casting 
about for a seductive argument, sug- 
gested that if Portia would consent 
to be his wife, so soon as she became 
a mother, she might return to Bibulus, 
Cato, however, was firm; he persisted 
in his refusal; yet, that it might not 
create ill feeling, he gave his own wife 
to Ilortensius, and when, later, Hortensis was gathered to his fathers, 
remarried the widow. 

But that everyone was not as anx- 
ious for matrimony the law Pappea 
Poppcca shows. According to its 
canons matrimony was an obligation 
the citizen owed to the state, procreation a duty. Whoso at twenty-five 
was not married, whoso, divorced or 
widowed did not remarry, whoso, 
though married, was without children, 
was regarded as an enemy and declared incapable of inheriting or of 
serving the state. To this law, one of 
Augustus' stupidities which presently 
fell into disuse, only a technical observance was paid. Men married just 
enough to gain a position or inherit a 
legacy; the next day they got a divorce. At the moment of need a 
child was adopted ; the moment passed, 
the child was disowned. But if the 
law had little value, at least it shows 



 



that virtue was infrequent, and it is 
precisely for this reason that the 
gossip concerning Tiberius may be 
treated as gossip should; he differed, 
and singularly from other men. 

" sempreamato lasolitaria vita" 
Petrarch, referring to himself, de- 
clared and, Tiberius might have said 
the same thing. He was in love with 
solitude; ill with efforts for the unattained; sick with the ingratitude of 
man. Presently it was decided that 
he had lived long enough. He was 
suffocated —beneath a mattress at that. 
Csesar had dreamed of a universal 
monarchy of which he should be 
king; he was murdered. That dream 
was also Anthony's; he killed himself. 
Cato had sought the restoration of 
the republic, and Brutus the attainment of virtue ; both committed 
suicide. Under the empire dreamers 
fared ill. Tiberius was a dreamer. 



 



In a palace where ii curious conception of the love of Atalanta and 
Meleager was said to figure on the 
walls, there was a door on which was 
a legend, imitated from one that overhung the Theban hbrary of Osy- 
mandias — Pharmacy of 
the Soul. It v;is there Tiberius 
dreamed. 

On the ivory shelves were the 
philters of Parthenius, libeled De 
Amatoriis A ecHonibtis  the Sybaris 
of Clitonymus, the Erotopmgnia of 
Lsevius, the maxims and instructions 
of Elephantis, the nine books of 
Sappho. There also were the pathetic 
adventures of Odatis and Zariadres, 
which Chares of Mitylene had given 
to the world; the astonishing tales of 
that early Cinderella, Rhodopis; and 
with them those romances of Ionian 
nights by Aristides of Milet, which 
Crassus took with him when he set 



 



out to subdue the Parthians, and 
which, found in the booty, were read 
aloud to the people that they might 
judge the morals of a nation that pretended to rule the world. 

Moral, certainly they were not; but 
like everything else which came from 
Greece, they were the work of a mas- 
ter in art. Concerning Aristidcs of 
Milet history is silent, but it may be 
safel}- conjectured that his life differed 
from' that of his heroes. As often as 
not the man who sounds the cymbals 
to the proprieties and plaj-s the flute 
to ethereal affection, conceals beneath 
obsequious cant the stigmata of satisfied vice. It is he who in vichy-water 
phrases pays to virtue the tribute of 
sin. On the other hand a tendency 
toward eroticism is the surest indication of chastity. It is continence that 
makes the St. Anthony. In the blood 
of the chaste cantharides abound. 



 



Whether such medicaments are serviceable to the soul is a different matter. Tiberius had other drugs on the 
ivory shelves — magic preparations that 
transported him to fabulous hetds. 
There was a work by Hecatsus, with 
which he could visit Hyperborea, that 
land where happiness was a birthright, 
inalienable at that; et a happiness so 
sweet that it must have been cloying; 
for the people who enjoyed it, and with 
it the appanage of limitless life, killed 
themselves from sheer ennui. Theo- 
pompus disclosed to him a stranger 
vista — a continent beyond the ocean — 
one where there were immense cities, 
and where two rivers flowed — the 
River of Pleasure and the River of 
Pain. With larabulus he discovered 
the Fortunate Isles, where there were 
men with elastic bones, bifurcated 
tongues ; men who never married, who 
worshipped the sun, whose life was an 



 



uninterrupted delight, and who, when 
overtaken by age, lay on a perfumed
