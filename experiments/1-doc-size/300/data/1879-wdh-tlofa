With this passion for the arrangement and dis- 
tribution of his neighbors, it was not long before he 
had placed most of the people on board in what he 
called the psychology of the ship. He did not care 
that they should fit exactly in their order. He 
rather preferred that they should have idiosyncra- 
sies which differentiated them from their species, 
and he enjoyed Lydia's being a little indifferent 
about books for this and for other reasons. " If 
she were literary, she would be like those vulgar 
little persons of genius in the magazine stories. 
She would have read all sorts of impossible things 
up in her village. She would have been discovered 
by some aesthetic summer boarder, who had hap- 
pened to identify her with the gifted Daisy Dawn, 
and she would be going out on the ^esthetic's money 
for the further expansion of her spirit in Europe. 
Somebody would be obliged to fall in love with her, 
and she would sacrifice her career for a man who 
was her inferior, as we should be subtly given to 
understand at the close. I think it 's going to be 



 

as distinguished by and by not to like books as it 
is not to write them. Lurella is a prophetic soul; 
and if there 's anything comforting about her, it 's 
her being so merely and stupidly pretty." 

" She is not merely and stupidly pretty ! " re- 
torted Dunham. " She never does herself justice 
when you are by. She can talk very well, and on 
some subjects she thinks strongly." 

u Oh, I 'm sorry for that ! " said Staniford. 
" But call me some time when she 's doing herself 
justice." 

"I don't mean that she 's like the women we 
know. She doesn 't say witty things, and she 
hasn 't their responsive quickness ; but her ideas 
are her own, no matter how old they are ; and 
what she says she seems to be saying for the first 
time, and as if it had never been thought out be- 
fore." 

" That is what I have been contending for," said 
Staniford ; " that is what I meant by spring water. 
It is that thrilling freshness which charms me in 
Lurella." He laughed. " Have you converted her 
to your spectacular faith, yet ? " Dunham blushed. 
" You have tried," continued Staniford. " Tell 
me about it ! " 

" I will not talk with you on such matters," said 
Dunham, " till you know how to treat serious 
things seriously." 

" I shall know how when I realize that they 
are serious with you. Well, I don't object to a 



 

woman's thinking strongly on religious subjects : 
it 's the only safe ground for her strong thinking, 
and even there she had better feel strongly. Did 
you succeed in convincing her that Archbishop 
Laud was a saint incompris, and the good King 
Charles a blessed martyr." 

Dunham did not answer till he had choked down 
some natural resentment. He had, several years 
earlier, forsaken the pale Unitarian worship of his 
family, because, Stamford always said, he had such 
a feeling for color, and had adopted an extreme tint 
of ritualism. It was rumored at one time, before 
his engagement to Miss Hibbard, that he was go- 
ing to unite with a celibate brotherhood ; he went 
regularly into retreat at certain seasons, to the 
vast entertainment of his friend ; and, within the 
bounds of good taste, he was a zealous propagan- 
dist of his faith, of which he had the practical vir- 
tues in high degree. " I hope," he said presently, 
" that I know how to respect convictions, even 
of those adhering to the Church in Error." 

Staniford laughed again. " I see you have not 
converted Lurella. Well, I like that in her, too. 
I wish I could have the arguments, pro and con. 
It would have been amusing. I suppose," lie pon- 
dered aloud, " that she is a Calvinist of the leepest 
dye, and would regard me as a lost spirit for being 
outside of her church. She would look down upon 
me from one height, as I look down upon her from 
another. And really, as far as personal satisfac- 



 

tion in superiority goes, she might have the ad- 
vantage of me. That 's very curious, very inter- 
esting." 

As the first week wore away, the wonted inci- 
dents of a sea voyage lent their variety to the life 
on board. One day the ship ran into a school of 
whales, which remained heavily thumping and loll- 
ing about in her course, and blowing jets of water 
into the air, like so many breaks in garden hose, 
Staniford suggested. At another time some flying- 
fish came on board. The sailors caught a dolphin, 
and they promised a shark, by and by. All these 
things were turned to account for the young girl's 
amusement, as if they had happened for her. The 
dolphin died that she might wonder and pity his 
beautiful death ; the cook fried her some of the 
flying-fish ; some one was on the lookout to detect 
even porpoises for her. A sail in the offing won 
the discoverer envy when he pointed it out to her ; 
a steamer, celebrity. The captain ran a point out 
of his course to speak to a vessel, that she might 
be able to tell what speaking a ship at sea was 
like. 

At table the stores which the young men had 
laid in for private use became common luxuries, 
and she fared sumptuously every day upon dainties 
which she supposed were supplied by the ship, — 
delicate jellies and canned meats and syruped fruits ; 
and, if she wondered at anything, she must have 
wondered at the scrupulous abstinence with which 



 

Captain Jenness, seconded by Mr. Watterson, re- 
fused the luxuries which his bounty provided them, 
and at the constancy with which Staniford declined 
some of these dishes, and Hicks declined others. 
Shortly after the latter began more distinctly to be 
tolerated, he appeared one day on deck with a 
steamer-chair in his hand, and offered it to Lyd- 
ia's use, where she sat on a stool by the bulwark. 
After that, as she reclined in this chair, wrapped 
in her red shawl, and provided with a book or 
some sort of becoming handiwork, she was even 
more picturesquely than before the centre about 
which the ship's pride and chivalrous sentiment re- 
volved. They were Americans, and they knew how 
to worship a woman. 

Staniford did not seek occasions to please and 
amuse her, as the others did. When they met, as 
they must, three times a clay, at table, he took his 
part in the talk, and now and then addressed her 
a perfunctory civility. He imagined that she dis- 
liked him, and he interested himself in imagining 
the ignorant grounds of her dislike. " A woman," 
he said, " must always dislike some one in com- 
pany ; it 's usually another woman ; as there 's none 
on board, I accept her enmity with meekness." 
Dunham wished to persuade him that he was mis- 
taken. " Don't try to comfort me, Dunham," he 
replied. " I find a pleasure in being detested which 
is inconceivable to your amiable bosom." 

Dunham turned to go below, from where they 



 

stood at the head of the cabin stairs. Staniford 
looked round, and saw Lydia, whom they had kept 
from coming up; she must have heard him. He 
took his cigar from his mouth, and caught up a 
stool, which he placed near the ship's side, where 
Lydia usually sat, and without waiting for her con- 
currence got a stool for himself, and sat down with 
her. 

"Well, Miss Blood," he said, "it's Saturday 
afternoon at last, and we 're at the end of our first 
week. Has it seemed very long to you ? " 

Lydia's color was bright with consciousness, but 
the glance she gave Staniford showed him looking 
tranquilly and honestly at her. " Yes," she said, 
" it has seemed long." 

" That 's merely the strangeness of everything. 
There 's nothing like local familiarity to make the 
time pass, — except monotony; and one gets both 
at sea. Next week will go faster than this, and 
we shall all be at Trieste before we know it. Of 
course we shall have a storm or two, and that will 
retard us in fact as well as fancy. But you would 
n't feel that you 'd been at sea if you hadn 't had a 
storm." 

He knew that his tone was patronizing, but he 
had theorized the girl so much with a certain slight 
in his mind that he was not able at once to get the 
tone which he usually took towards women. This 
might not, indeed, have pleased some women any 
better than patronage : it mocked while it caressed 



 

all their little pretenses and artificialities ; he ad- 
dressed them as if they must be in the joke of 
themselves, and did not expect to be taken seri- 
ously. At the same time he liked them greatly, 
and would not on any account have had the silliest 
of them different from what she was. He did not 
seek them as Dunham did ; their society was not a 
matter of life or death with him; but he had an 
elder-brotherly kindness for the whole sex. 

Lydia waited awhile for him to say something 
more, but he added nothing, and she observed, with 
a furtive look : " I presume you ? ve seen some very 
severe storms at sea." 

" No," Staniford answered, " I have n't. I 've 
been over several times, but I 've never seen any- 
thing alarming. I 've experienced the ordinary 
seasickening tempestuousness." 

" Have you — have you ever been in Italy?" 
asked Lydia, after another pause. 

" Yes," he said, " twice ; I 'm very fond of Italy." 
He spoke of it in a familiar tone that might well 
have been discouraging to one of her total unac- 
quaintance with it. Presently he added of his own 
motion, looking at her with his interest in her as a 
curious study, " You 're going to Venice, I think 
Mr. Dunham told me." 

" Yes," said Lydia. 

" Well, I think it 's rather a pity that you should 
n't arrive there directly, without the interposition 
of Trieste." He scanned her yet more closely, but 

 



 

with a sort of absence in his look, as if he addressed 
some ideal of her. 

" Why ? " asked Lydia, apparently pushed to 
some self-assertion by this way of being looked and 
talked at. 

"It's the strangest place in the world," said 
Staniford ; and then he mused again. "But I sup- 
pose" — He did not go on, and the word fell again 
to Lydia. 

"I'm going to visit my aunt, who is staying 
there. She was where I live, last summer, and she 
told us about it. But I couldn 't seem to under- 
stand it." 

" No one can understand it, without seeing it." 

" I 've read some descriptions of it," Lydia vent- 
ured. 

" They 're of no use, — the books." 

" Is Trieste a strange place, too ? " 

" It 's strange, as a hundred other places are, — 
and it 's picturesque ; but there 's only one Ven- 
ice." 

" I 'm afraid sometimes," she faltered, as if his 
manner in regard to this peculiar place had been 
hopelessly exclusive, " that it will be almost too 
strange." 

"Oh, that 's another matter," said Staniford. 
"I confess I should be rather curious to know 
whether you liked Venice. I like it, but I can im- 
agine myself sympathizing with people who de- 
tested it, — if they said so. Let me see what will
