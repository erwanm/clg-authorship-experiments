relation with the personage, and that if ever he 





 

had himself known curiosity as to what might 
happen when manners were consistently enough 
ignored it was a point on which he should at once 
be enlightened. His fellow-visitor, of whose be- 
ing there Doctor Hatch and Miss Mumby were 
presumably unaware, continued to ignore every- 
thing but the opportunity he enjoyed and the 
certainty that Graham would contribute to it — 
which certainty made in fact his profit. The 
profit, that is, couldn't possibly fail unless Gray 
should turn his back and walk off"; which was 
of course possible, but would then saddle Gray 
himself with the repudiation of forms: so that — 
yes, infallibly — in proportion as the young man 
had to be commonly civil would Mr. Gaw's per- 
haps unholy satisfaction of it be able to prevail. 
The young man had taken it home that he couldn't 
simply stare long enough for successful defence 
by the time that, presently moving nearer, he 
uttered his adversary's name with no intimation 
of a doubt. Mr. Gaw failed, Gray was afterwards 
to inform Rosanna, "to so much as take this 
up"; he was left with everything on his hands 
but the character of his identity, the indications 
of his face, the betrayals he should so much less 
succeed in suppressing than his adversary would 
succeed in reading them. The figure presented 
hadn't stirred from his posture otherwise than 
by a motion of eye just perceptible as Graham 
moved; it was drinking him in, our hero felt, 





 

and by this treatment of the full cup, continuously 
applied to the lips, stillness was of course imposed. 
It didn't again so much as recognise, by any sign 
given, Graham's remark that an acquaintance 
with Miss Gaw from of old involved naturally 
their acquaintance: there was no question of 
Miss Gaw, her friend found himself after another 
minute divining, as there was none of objects 
or appearances immediately there about them; 
the question was of something a thousand times 
more relevant and present, of something the in- 
terloper's silence, far more than breathed words 
could have done, represented the fond hope of 
mastering. 

Graham thus held already, by the old man's 
conviction, a secret of high value, yet which, 
with the occasion stretched a little, would prac- 
tically be at his service — so much as that at least, 
with the passage of another moment, he had con- 
cluded to; and all the while, in the absurdest 
way, without his guessing, without his at all 
measuring, his secret himself. Mr. Gaw fairly 
made him want to — want, that is, as a prelim- 
inary or a stopgap, to guess what it had best, 
most desirably and most effectively, become; for 
shouldn't he positively like to have something of 
the sort in order just to disoblige this gentleman ? 
Strange enough how it came to him at once as a 
result of the father's refusal of attention to any 
connection he might have glanced at with the 





 

daughter, strange enough how it came to him, 
under the first flush of heat he had known since 
his arrival, that two could play at such a game 
and that if Rosanna's interests were to be so 
slighted her relative himself should miss even the 
minimum of application as one of them. "He 
must have wanted to know, he must have wanted 

to know !" this young woman was on a later 

day to have begun to explain; without going on, 
however, since by that time Gray had rather 
made out, the still greater rush of his impressions 
helping, the truth of Mr. Gaw's desire. It bore, 
that appetite, upon a single point and, daughter 
or no daughter, on nothing else in the world — 
the question of what Gray's "interest," in the 
light of his uncle's intentions, might size up to; 
those intentions having, to the Gaw imagination, 
been of course apprehensible on the spot, and 
within the few hours that had lapsed, by a nephew 
even of but rudimentary mind. At the present 
hour meanwhile, short of the miracle which our 
friend's counter-scrutiny alone could have brought 
about, there worked for this young intelligence, 
and with no small sharpness, the fact itself of 
such a revealed relation to the ebb of their host's 
life — upon which was thrust the appearance of 
its being, watch in hand, all impatiently, or in 
other words all offensively, timed. The very air 
at this instant tasted to Gray, quite as if some- 
thing under his tongue had suddenly turned from 





 

the sweet to the appreciably sour, of an assump- 
tion diffused through it in respect to the rudi- 
ments of mind. He was afterwards to date the 
breaking-in upon him of the general measure of 
the smallest vision of business a young man might 
self-respectingly confess to from Mr. Gaw's ex- 
traordinary tacit "Oh come, you can't fool me: 
don't I know you know what I want to know — 
don't I know what it must mean for you to have 
been here since six o'clock this morning with 
nothing whatever else to do than just to take it 
in?" 

That was it — Gray was to have taken in the 
more or less definite value involved for him in 
his uncle's supposedly near extinction, and was 
to be capable, if not of expressing it on the spot 
in the only terms in which a value of any sort 
could exist for this worthy, yet still at least of 
liability to such a betrayal as would yield him 
something to conclude upon. It was only after- 
wards, once more, that our young man was to 
master the logic of the conclusive as it prevailed 
for Mr. Gaw; what concerned his curiosity was 
to settle whether or no they were in presence 
together of a really big fact — distinguishing as 
the Gaw mind did among such dimensions and 
addressed as it essentially was to a special ques- 
tion — a question as yet unrecognised by Gray. 
He was subsequently to have his friend's word 
to go upon — when, in the extraordinary light of 





 

Rosanna's explication, he read clear what he had 
been able on the verandah but half to glimmer 
out: the queer truth of Mr. Gaw's hunger to 
learn to what extent he had anciently, to what 
degree he had irremediably, ruined his whilom 
associate. He didn't know— .so strange was it, 
at the time and since, that, thanks to the way 
Mr. Betterman had himself fixed things, he 
couldn't be sure; but what he wanted, and what 
he hung about so displeasingly to sniff up the 
least stray sign of, was a confirmation of his 
belief that Doctor Hatch's and Miss Mumby's 
patient had never really recovered from the 
wound of years before. They were nursing him 
now for another complaint altogether, this one 
admittedly such as must, with but the scantest 
further reprieve, dispose of him; whereas doubts 
were deep, as Mr. Gaw at least entertained them, 
as to whether the damage he supposed his own 
just resentment to have inflicted when propriety 
and opportunity combined to inspire him was 
amenable even to nursing the most expert or to 
medication the most subtle. These mysteries of 
calculation were of course impenetrable to Gray 
during the moments at which we see him so al- 
most indescribably exposed at once and rein- 
forced; but the effect of the sharper and sharper 
sense as of a spring pressed by his companion was 
that a whole consciousness suddenly welled up in 
him and that within a few more seconds he had 





 

become aware of a need absolutely adverse to 
any trap that might be laid for his candour. He 
could as little have then said why as he could 
vividly have phrased it under the knowledge to 
come, but that his mute interlocutor desired some- 
how their association in a judgment of what his 
uncle was "worth," a judgment from which a 
comparatively conceited nephew might receive an 
incidental lesson, played through him as a certi- 
tude and produced quite another inclination. 
That recognition of the pleasant on which he had 
been floating affirmed itself as in the very face 
of so embodied a pretension to affirm the direct 
opposite, to thrust up at him in fine a horrid con- 
tradiction — a contradiction which he next heard 
himself take, after the happiest fashion, the 
straightest way to rebut. 

"I'm sure you'll be glad to know that I seem 
to be doing my uncle a tremendous lot of good. 
They tell me I'm really bringing him round" — 
and Graham smiled down at little blanched Mr. 
Gaw. "I don't despair at all of his getting much 
better." 

It was on this that for the first time Mr. Gaw 

became articulate. "Better ?" he strangely 

quavered, and as if his very eyes questioned such 
conscious flippancy. 

"Why yes — through cheering him up. He 
takes, I gather," Gray went on, " as much pleasure 
as I do — — !" His assurance, however, had 





 

within the minute dropped a little — the effect of 
it might really reach, he apprehended, beyond 
his idea. The old man had been odd enough, 
but now of a sudden he looked sick, and that 
one couldn't desire. 

"'Pleasure' ?" he was nevertheless able 

to echo; while it struck Gray that no sound so 
weak had ever been so sharp, or none so sharp 
ever so weak. "Pleasure in dying; — > — ?" Mr. 
Gaw asked in this flatness of doubt. 

"But my dear sir," said Gray, his impulse to 
be jaunty still nevertheless holding out a little, 
"but, my dear sir, if, as it strikes me, he isn't 
dying ?" 

"Oh twaddle!" snapped Mr. Gaw with the 
emphasis of his glare — shifted a moment, Gray 
next saw, to a new object in range. Gray felt 
himself even before turning for it rejoined by 
Miss Mumby, who, rounding the corner of the 
house, had paused as in presence of an odd con- 
junction; not made the less odd moreover by 
Mr. Gaw's instant appeal to her. "You think 
he ain't then going to ? " 

He had to leave it at that, but Miss Mumby 
supplied, with the loudest confidence, what ap- 
peared to be wanted. "He ain't going to get 
better? Oh we hope so!" she declared to Gra- 
ham's delight. 

It helped him to contribute in his own way. 
"Mr. Gaw's surprise seems for his holding out !" 





 

"Oh I guess he'll hold out," Miss Mumby was 
pleased to say. 

"Then if he ain't dying what's the fuss about?" 
Mr. Gaw wanted to know. 

"Why there ain't any fuss — but what you 
seem to make," Miss Mumby could quite assure 
him. 

"Oh well, if you answer for it !" He got 

up on this, though with an alertness that, to 
Gray's sense, didn't work quite truly, and stood 
an instant looking from one of his companions 
to the other, while our young man's eyes, for 
their part, put a question to Miss Mumby 's — 
a question which, articulated, would have had
