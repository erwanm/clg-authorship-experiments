anxiety, when once they had the least recogni- 
tion of their individual distinction. The impulse 
is more subtle than the desire for wealth or the 
craving for political place. In some cases it is 
in simple obedience to the longing to create ; in 
others it is a lower ambition for notoriety, for 
praise. 

In any case the experiment of authorship, in 
however humble a way, has an analogy to that 
other tempting occupation of making " invest- 
ments" in the stock-market: the first trial is 
certain to lead to another. If the author suc- 
ceeds in any degree, his spirit rises to another 
attempt in the hope of a wider recognition. If 



 

he fails, that is a reason why he should convince 
his fellows that the failure was not inherent in 
himself, but in ill-luck or a misdirection of his 
powers. And the experiment has another anal- 
ogy to the noble occupation of levying toll upon 
the change of values — a first brilliant success 
is often a misfortune, inducing an overestimate 
of capacity, while a very moderate success, recog- 
nized indeed only as a trial, steadies a man, and 
sets him upon that serious dihgence upon which 
alone, either in art or business, any solid fortune 
is built. 

Philip was fortunate in that his first novel 
won him a few friends and a little recognition, 
but no popularity. It excited neither envy nor 
hostility. In the perfunctory and somewhat 
commercial good words it received, he recog- 
nized the good-nature of the world. In the few 
short reviews that dealt seriously with his work, 
he was able, when the excitement of seeing him- 
self discussed had subsided, to read between the 
lines why The Puritan Nim had failed to make 
a larger appeal. It was idyllic and poetic, but 
it lacked virility; it lacked also simplicity in 
dealing with the simple and profound facts of 
life. He had been too solicitous to express him- 
self, to write beautifully, instead of letting the 
human emotions with which he had to deal show 
themselves. One notice had said that it was too 




 

" literary"; by which, of course, the critic meant 
that he did not follow the solid traditions, the 
essential elements in all the great masterpieces 
of literature that have been created. And yet 
he had shown a quality, a facility, a promise, 
that had gained him a foothold and a support in 
the world of books and of the making of books. 
And though he had declined Mr. Ault's tempt- 
ing offer to illuminate his transcontinental road 
with a literary torch, he none the less was pleased 
with this recognition of his capacity and the 
value of his name. 

To say that Philip lived on hope during this 
summer of heat, suspensions, and business de- 
rangement would be to allow him a too substan- 
tial subsistence. Evelyn, indeed, seemed, at the 
distance of Newport, more unattainable than 
ever, and the scant news he had of the drama 
enacted there was a perpetual notice to him of 
the social gulf that lay between them. And yet 
his dream was sustained by occasional assurances 
from Miss McDonald of her confidence in Eve- 
lyn's belief in him, nay, of her trust, and she 
even went so far as to say affection. So he went 
on building castles in the air, which melted and 
were renewed day after day, like the transient 
but unfailing splendor of the sunset. 

There was a certain exaltation in this indul- 
gence of his passion that stimulated his creative 




 

faculties, and, while his daily tasks kept him from 
being morbid, his imagination was free to play 
with the construction of a new story, to which 
his recent experience would give a certain solid- 
ity and a knowledge of the human struggle as 
it is. He found himself observing character 
more closely than before, looking for it not so 
much in books as in the people he met. There 
was Murad Ault, for instance. How he would 
like to put him into a book ! Of course it would 
not do to copy a model, raw, like that, but he 
fell to studying his traits, trying to see the com- 
mon humanity exhibited in him. Was he a type 
or was he a freak ? This was, however, too dan- 
gerous ground until he knew more of life. 

The week's vacation allowed him by his house 
was passed in Eivervale. There, in the calmness 
of country life, and in the domestic atmosphere 
of affection which believed in him, he was far 
enough removed from the scene of the spectres 
of his imagination to see them in proper per- 
spective, and there the lines of his new venture 
were laid down, to be worked out later on, he 
well knew, in the anxiety and the toil which 
should endue the skeleton with life. Eivervale, 
to be sure, was haunted by the remembrance of 
Evelyn ; very often the familiar scenes filled him 
with an intolerable longing to see again the eyes 
that had inspired him, to hear the voice that was 





like no other in the world, to take the little hand 
that had often been so frankly placed in his, and 
to draw to him the form in which was embodied 
all the grace and tender witchery of womanhood. 
But the knowledge of what she expected of him 
was an inspiration, always present in his visions 
of her. 

Something of his hopes and fears Alice divined, 
and he felt her sympathy, although she did not 
intrude upon his reticence by any questions. 
They talked about Evelyn, but it was Evelyn in 
Eivervale, not in Newport. In fact, the sensible 
girl could regard her cousin's passion as nothing 
more than a romance in a young author's life, 
and to her it was a sign of his security that he 
had projected a new story. With instinctive 
perception of his need, she was ever turning his 
thoughts upon his literary career. Of course she 
and all the household seemed in a conspiracy to 
flatter and encourage the vanity of authorship. 
"Was not all the village talking about the repu- 
tation he had conferred on it ? Was it not proud 
of him? Indeed, it did imagine that the world 
outside of Eivervale was very much interested 
in him, and that he was already an author of 
distinction. The county Gazette had announced, 
as an important piece of news, that the author of 
The Puritan Nun was on a visit to his rela- 
tives, the Maitlands. This paragraph seemed to 




 

stand out in the paper as an almost immodest 
exposure of family life, read furtively at first, 
and not talked of, and yet every member of the 
family was conscious of an increase in the fam- 
ily importance. Aunt Patience discovered, from 
her outlook on the road, that summer visitors 
had a habit of driving or walking past the house 
and then turning back to look at it again. 

So Philip was not only distinguished, but he 
had the power of conferring distinction. 'No one 
can envy a young author this first taste of fame, 
this home recognition. Whatever he may do 
hereafter, how much more substantial rewards 
he may attain, this first sweetness of incense to 
his ambition will never come to him again. 

When Philip returned to town, the city was 
still a social desert, and he plunged into the work 
piled up on his desk, the never-ceasing accumu- 
lation of manuscripts, most of them shells which 
the workers have dredged up from the mud of 
the literary ocean, in which the eager publisher 
is always expecting to find pearls. Even Celia 
was still in the country, and Philip's hours spared 
from drudgery were given to the new story. His 
days, therefore, passed without incident, but not 
without pleasure. For whatever annoyances the 
great city may have usually, it is in the dull 
season — that is, the season of its summer out-of- 
doors animation — a most attractive and even stim- 




 

ulating place for the man who has an absorbing 
pursuit, say a work in creative fiction. Undis- 
turbed by social claims or public interests, the 
very noise and whirl of the gay metropolis seem 
to hem him in and protect the world of his own 
imagination. 

The first disturbing event in this serenity was 
the report of the Mavick ball, already referred 
to, and the interpretation put upon it by the 
newspapers. In this light his plans seemed the 
merest moonshine. What became of his falla- 
cious hope of waiting when events were driving 
on at this rate? What chance had he in such a 
social current ? Would Evelyn be strong enough 
to stem it and to wait also? And to wait for 
what? For the indefinite and improbable event 
of a poor author, hardly yet recognized as an 
author, coming into position, into an income (for 
that was the weak point in his aspirations) that 
would not be laughed at by the millionaire. 
When he coolly considered it, was it reasonable 
to expect that Mr. and Mrs. Mavick would ever 
permit Evelyn to throw away the brilliant op- 
portunity for their daughter which was to be 
the crowning end of their social ambition ? The 
mere statement of the proposition was enough 
to overwhelm him. 

That this would be the opinion of the world 
he could not doubt. He felt very much alone. 




 

It was not, however, in any resolve to make a 
confidante of Celia, but in an absolute need of 
companionship, that he went to see if she had 
returned. That he had any personal interest in 
this ball he did not intend to let Celia know, but 
talk with somebody he must. Of his deep affec- 
tion for this friend of his boyhood, there was no 
doubt, nor of his knowledge of her devotion to 
his interests. "Why, then, was he reserved with 
her upon the absorbing interest of his life ? 

Celia had returned, before the opening of the 
medical college, full of a new idea. This was 
nothing new in her restless nature ; but if Philip 
had not been blinded by the common selfishness 
of his sex, he might have seen in the gladness of 
her welcome of him something more than mere 
sisterly affection. 

" Are you real glad to see me, Phil ? I thought 
you might be lonesome by this time in the de- 
serted city." 

" I was, horribly." He was still holding her 
hand. " Without a chance to talk with you or 
Alice, I am quite an orphan." 

"Ah ! You or Alice !" A shade of disappoint- 
ment came over her face as she dropped his 
hand. But she rallied in a moment. 

" Poor boy ! You ought to have a guardian. 
What heroine of romance are you running after 
now ?" 





 

" In my new story ?" 

" Of course." 

"She isn't very well defined in my mind yet.,; 
But a lovely girl, without anything peculiar, no 
education to speak of, or career, fascinating in 
her womanhood, such as might walk out of the 
Bible. Don't you think that would be a novelty ? 
But it is the most difficult to do." 

" Negative. That sort has gone out. Philip, 
why don't you take the heroine of the Mavick 
ball? There is a theme." She was watching 
hira shrewdly, and saw the flush in his face as 
he hurriedly asked, 

" Did you ever see her?" 

" Only at a distance. But you must know her 
well enough for a literary purpose. The reports
