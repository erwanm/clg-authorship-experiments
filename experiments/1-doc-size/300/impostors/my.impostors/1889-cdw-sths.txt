hundred thousand dollars a mile. The cost of the parks and boulevards
in each of the three divisions is met by a tax on the property in
that division. The tax is considerable, but the wise liberality of
the citizens has done for the town what only royalty usually
accomplishes—given it magnificent roads; and if good roads are a
criterion of civilization, Chicago must stand very high. But it needed
a community with a great deal of daring and confidence in the future to
create this park system.

One in the heart of the city has not to drive three or four miles
over cobble-stones and ruts to get to good driving-ground. When he
has entered Michigan avenue he need not pull rein for twenty to thirty
miles. This is almost literally true as to extent, without counting the
miles of fine drives in the parks; for the city proper is circled by
great parks, already laid out as pleasure-grounds, tree-planted
and beautified to a high degree, although they are nothing to what
cultivation will make them in ten years more. On the lake shore, at
the south, is Jackson Park; next is Washington Park, twice as large as
Central Park, New York; then, farther to the west, and north, Douglas
Park and Garfield Park; then Humboldt Park, until we come round to
Lincoln Park, on the lake shore on the north side. These parks are
all connected by broad boulevards, some of which are not yet fully
developed, thus forming a continuous park drive, with enough of nature
and enough of varied architecture for variety, unsurpassed, I should
say, in the world within any city limits. Washington Park, with a
slightly rolling surface and beautiful landscape-gardening, has not only
fine drive-ways, but a splendid road set apart for horsemen. This is
a dirt road, always well sprinkled, and the equestrian has a chance
besides of a gallop over springy turf. Water is now so abundantly
provided that this park is kept green in the driest season. From
anywhere in the south side one may mount his horse or enter his carriage
for a turn of fifteen or twenty miles on what is equivalent to a country
road—that is to say, an English country road. Of the effect of this
facility on social life I shall have occasion to speak. On the lake side
of Washington Park are the grounds of the Washington Park Racing Club,
with a splendid track, and stables and other facilities which, I am
told, exceed anything of the kind in the country. The club-house itself
is very handsome and commodious, is open to the members and their
families summer and winter, and makes a favorite rendezvous for that
part of society which shares its privileges. Besides its large dining
and dancing halls, it has elegant apartments set apart for ladies. In
winter its hospitable rooms and big wood fires are very attractive after
a zero drive.

Almost equal facility for driving and riding is had on the north side by
taking the lake-shore drive to Lincoln Park. Too much cannot be said of
the beauty of this drive along the curving shore of an inland sea, ever
attractive in the play of changing lights and colors, and beginning to
be fronted by palatial houses—a foretaste of the coming Venetian variety
and splendor. The park itself, dignified by the Lincoln statue, is
an exquisite piece of restful landscape, looked over by a thickening
assemblage of stately residences. It is a quarter of spacious elegance.

One hardly knows how to speak justly of either the physical aspect or
the social life of Chicago, the present performance suggesting such
promise and immediate change. The excited admiration waits a little upon
expectation. I should like to sec it in five years—in ten years; it is
a formative period, but one of such excellence of execution that the
imagination takes a very high flight in anticipating the result of
another quarter of a century. What other city has begun so nobly or
has planned so liberally for metropolitan solidity, elegance, and
recreation? What other has such magnificent, avenues and boulevards,
and such a system of parks? The boy is born here who will see the town
expanded far beyond these splendid pleasure-grounds, and what is now
the circumference of the city will be to Chicago what the vernal gardens
from St. James to Hampton are to London. This anticipation hardly seems
strange when one remembers what Chicago was fifteen years ago.

Architecturally, Chicago is more interesting than many older cities. Its
wealth and opportunity for fine building coming when our national
taste is beginning to be individual, it has escaped the monotony and
mediocrity in which New York for so many years put its money, and out
of the sameness of which it is escaping in spots. Having also plenty of
room, Chicago has been able to avoid the block system in its residences,
and to give play to variety and creative genius. It is impossible to do
much with the interior of a house in a block, however much you may load
the front with ornament. Confined to a long parallelogram, and limited
as to light and air, neither comfort nor individual taste can be
consulted or satisfied. Chicago is a city of detached houses, in the
humbler quarters as well as in the magnificent avenues, and the
effect is home-like and beautiful at the same time. There is great
variety—stone, brick, and wood intermingled, plain and ornamental; but
drive where you will in the favorite residence parts of the vast city,
you will be continually surprised with the sight of noble and artistic
houses and homes displaying taste as well as luxury. In addition to the
business and public buildings of which I spoke, there are several, like
the Art Museum, the Studebaker Building, and the new Auditorium, which
would be conspicuous and admired in any city in the world. The city is
rich in a few specimens of private houses by Mr. Richardson (whose loss
to the country is still apparently irreparable), houses worth a long
journey to see, so simple, so noble, so full of comfort, sentiment,
unique, having what may be called a charming personality. As to
interiors, there has been plenty of money spent in Chicago in mere show;
but, after all, I know of no other city that has more character and
individuality in its interiors, more evidences of personal refinement
and taste. There is, of course—Boston knows that—a grace and richness
in a dwelling in which generations have accumulated the best fruits of
wealth and cultivation; but any tasteful stranger here, I am sure, will
be surprised to find in a city so new so many homes pervaded by the
atmosphere of books and art and refined sensibility, due, I imagine,
mainly to the taste of the women, for while there are plenty of men here
who have taste, there are very few who have leisure to indulge it; and
I doubt if there was ever anywhere a livable house—a man can build a
palace, but he cannot make a home—that was not the creation of a refined
woman. I do not mean to say that Chicago is not still very much the
victim of the upholsterer, and that the eye is not offended by a good
deal that is gaudy and pretentious, but there is so much here that is in
exquisite taste that one has a hopeful heart about its future. Everybody
is not yet educated up to the “Richardson houses,” but nothing is
more certain than that they will powerfully influence all the future
architecture of the town.

Perhaps there never was before such an opportunity to study the growth
of an enormous city, physically and socially, as is offered now in
Chicago, where the development of half a century is condensed into a
decade. In one respect it differs from all other cities of anything like
its size. It is not only surrounded by a complete net-work of railways,
but it is permeated by them. The converging lines of twenty-one (I think
it is) railways paralleling each other or criss-crossing in the suburbs
concentrate upon fewer tracks as they enter the dense part of the
city, but they literally surround it, and actually pierce its heart. So
complete is this environment and interlacing that you cannot enter the
city from any direction without encountering a net-work of tracks. None
of the water-front, except a strip on the north side, is free from them.
The finest residence part of the south side, including the boulevards
and parks, is surrounded and cut by them. There are a few viaducts, but
for the most part the tracks occupy streets, and the crossings are at
grade. Along the Michigan avenue water-front and down the lake shore to
Hyde Park, on the Illinois Central and the Michigan Central and their
connections, the foreign and local trains pass incessantly (I believe
over sixty a day), and the Illinois crosses above Sixteenth Street,
cutting all the great southward avenues; and farther down, the tracks
run between Jackson Park and Washington Park, crossing at grade the
500-feet-wide boulevard which connects these great parks and makes them
one. These tracks and grade crossings, from which so few parts of the
city are free, are a serious evil and danger, and the annoyance is
increased by the multiplicity of street railway’s, and by the swiftly
running cable-cars, which are a constant source of alarm to the timid.
The railways present a difficult problem. The town covers such a vast
area (always extending in a ratio that cannot be calculated) that to
place all the passenger stations outside would be a great inconvenience,
to unite the lines in a single station probably impracticable. In time,
however, the roads must come in on elevated viaducts, or concentrate in
three or four stations which communicate with the central parts of the
town by elevated roads.

This state of things arose from the fact that the railways antedated,
and we may say made, the town, which has grown up along their lines. To
a town of pure business, transportation was the first requisite, and the
newer roads have been encouraged to penetrate as far into the city as
they could. Now that it is necessary to make it a city to live in safely
and agreeably, the railways are regarded from another point of view. I
suppose a sociologist would make some reflections on the effect of such
a thorough permeation of tracks, trains, engines, and traffic upon
the temperament of a town, the action of these exciting and irritating
causes upon its nervous centres. Living in a big railway-station must
have an effect on the nerves. At present this seems a legitimate part
of the excited activity of the city; but if it continues, with the rapid
increase of wealth and the growth of a leisure class, the inhabitants
who can afford to get away will live here only the few months necessary
to do their business and take a short season of social gayety, and then
go to quieter places early in the spring and for the summer months.

It is at this point of view that the value of the park system appears,
not only as a relief, as easily accessible recreation-grounds for the
inhabitants in every part of the city, but as an element in society
life. These parks, which I have already named, contain 1742 acres.
The two south parks, connected so as to be substantially one, have 957
acres. Their great connecting boulevards are interfered with somewhat by
railway-tracks, and none of them, except Lincoln, can be reached without
crossing tracks on which locomotives run, yet, as has been said, the
most important of them are led to by good driving-roads from the heart
of the city. They have excellent roads set apart for equestrians as
well as for driving. These facilities induce the keeping of horses, the
setting up of fine equipages, and a display for which no other city has
better opportunity. This cannot but have an appreciable effect upon the
growth of luxury and display in this direction. Indeed, it is already
true that the city keeps more private carriages—for the pleasure not
only of the rich, but of the well-to-do—in proportion to its population,
than any other large city I know. These broad thoroughfares, kept free
from traffic, furnish excellent sleighing when it does not exist in the
city streets generally, and in the summer unequalled avenues for the
show of wealth and beauty and style. In a few years the turnouts on the
Grand Boulevard and the Lincoln Park drive will be worth going far to
see for those who admire—and who does not? for, the world over, wealth
has no spectacle more attractive to all classes—fine horses and the
splendor of moving equipages. And here is no cramped mile or two for
parade, like most of the fashionable drives of the world, but space
inviting healthful exercise as well as display. These broad avenues and
park outlooks, with ample ground-room, stimulate architectural rivalry,
and this opportunity for driving and riding and being on view cannot but
affect very strongly the social tone. The foresight of the busy men who
planned this park system is already vindicated. The public appreciate
their privileges. On fair days the driving avenues are thronged. One
Sunday afternoon in January, when the sleighing was good, some one
estimated that there were as many as ten thousand teams flying up and
down Michigan avenue and the Grand Boulevard. This was, of course, an
over-estimate, but the throng made a ten-thousand impression on the
mind. Perhaps it was a note of Western independence that a woman was
here and there seen “speeding” a fast horse, in a cutter, alone.

I suppose that most of these people had been to church in the morning,
for Chicago, which does everything it puts its hand to with tremendous
energy, is a church-going city, and I believe presents some contrast to
Cincinnati in this respect. Religious, mission, and Sunday-school work
is very active, churches are many, whatever the liberality of the creeds
of a majority of them, and there are several congregations of over two
thousand people. One vast music-hall and one theatre are thronged Sunday
after Sunday with organized, vigorous, worshipful congregations. Besides
these are the Sunday meetings for ethical culture and Christian science.
It is true that many of the theatres are open as on week-days, and there
is a vast foreign population that takes its day of rest in idleness or
base-ball and garden amusements, but the prevailing aspect of the city
is that of Sunday observance. There is a good deal of wholesome New
England in its tone. And it welcomes any form of activity—orthodoxy,
liberalism, revivals, ethical culture.

A special interest in Chicago at the moment is because it is
forming—full of contrasts and of promise, palaces and shanties side by
side. Its forces are gathered and accumulating, but not assimilated.
What a mass of crude, undigested material it has! In one region on the
west side are twenty thousand Bohemians and Poles; the street signs
are all foreign and of unpronounceable names—a physically strong,
but mentally and morally brutal, people for the most part; the adults
generally do not speak English, and claning as they do, they probably
never will. There is no hope that this generation will be intelligent
American citizens, or be otherwise than the political prey of
demagogues. But their children are in the excellent public schools, and
will take in American ideas and take on American ways. Still, the mill
has about as much grist as it can grind at present.

Social life is, speaking generally, as unformed, unselected, as the
city—that is, more fluid and undetermined than in Eastern large cities.
That is merely to say, however, that while it is American, it is young.
When you come to individuals, the people in society are largely from
the East, or have Eastern connections that determine their conduct. For
twenty years the great universities, Harvard, Yale, Amherst, Princeton,
and the rest, have been pouring in their young men here. There is no
better element in the world, and it is felt in every pulse of the town.
Young couples marry and come here from every sort of Eastern circle. But
the town has grown so fast, and so many new people have come into the
ability suddenly to spend money in fine houses and equipages, that the
people do not know each other. You may drive past miles of good houses,
with a man who has grown up with the town, who cannot tell you who any
of the occupants of the houses are. Men know each other on change, in
the courts, in business, and are beginning to know each other in clubs,
but society has not got itself sorted out and arranged, or discovered
its elements. This is a metropolitan trait, it is true, but the
condition is socially very different from what it is in New York or
Boston; the small village associations survive a little yet, struggling
against the territorial distances, but the social mass is still
unorganized, although “society” is a prominent feature in the
newspapers. Of course it is understood that there are people “in
society,” and dinners, and all that, in nowise different from the same
people and events the world over.

A striking feature of the town is “youth,” visible in social life as
well as in business. An Eastern man is surprised to see so many young
men in responsible positions, at the head, or taking the managing oar,
in great moneyed institutions, in railway corporations, and in societies
of charity and culture. A young man, graduate of the city high-school,
is at the same time president of a prominent bank, president of the
Board of Trade, and president of the Art Institute. This youthful spirit
must be contagious, for apparently the more elderly men do not permit
themselves to become old, either in the business or the pleasures of
life. Everything goes on with youthful vim and spirit.

Next to the youth, and perhaps more noticeable, the characteristic
feature of Chicago is money-making, and the money power is as obtrusive
socially as on change. When we come to speak of educational and
intellectual tendencies, it will be seen how this spirit is being at
once utilized and mitigated; but for the moment money is the recognized
power. How could it be otherwise? Youth and energy did not flock here
for pleasure or for society, but simply for fortune. And success in
money-getting was about the only one considered. And it is still that
by which Chicago is chiefly known abroad, by that and by a certain
consciousness of it which is noticed. And as women reflect social
conditions most vividly, it cannot be denied that there is a type known
in Europe and in the East as the Chicago young woman, capable rather
than timid, dashing rather than retiring, quite able to take care of
herself. But this is not by any means an exhaustive account of the
Chicago woman of to-day.

While it must be said that the men, as a rule, are too much absorbed
in business to give heed to anything else, yet even this statement will
need more qualification than would appear at first, when we come to
consider the educational, industrial, and reformatory projects. And
indeed a veritable exception is the Literary Club, of nearly two hundred
members, a mingling of business and professional men, who have fine
rooms in the Art Building, and meet weekly for papers and discussions.
It is not in every city that an equal number of busy men will give
the time to this sort of intellectual recreation. The energy here is
superabundant; in whatever direction it is exerted it is very effective;
and it may be said, in the language of the street, that if the men of
Chicago seriously take hold of culture, they will make it hum.

Still it remains true here, as elsewhere in the United States, that
women are in advance in the intellectual revival. One cannot yet
predict what will be the result of this continental furor for literary,
scientific, and study clubs—in some places in the East the literary wave
