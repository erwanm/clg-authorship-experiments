And Jim outgrew his fancy, and had many 
another one that did not strike deep enough in the 
soil to lead him to ask a woman to marry him. 
But he and Daisy were fast friends, and he saw that 
no one could ever have cared for her as well and 
wisely as dear Doctor Joe, with his wonderful 
tenderness. 

Jim, brilliant and gay and witty, was a fine, fluent 
speaker, studying such eloquent models as Web- 
ster and Choate, and the vanished Clay. Did 
Hanny remember, when they had lost his election, 
and he, Jim, had turned out with the Democratic 
boys? There arc grave questions now, on wider 
than party lines, and sometimes the hearts of 
thoughtful statesmen beat with an undefined fc:ir. 

The fun-loving, dancing side of his nature often 

 

asserts itself. Women adore him. Though he is 
not rich, the mothers smile on him for the " prom- 
ise yet to be." Even Lily Williamson tries her 
arts ; admiration is what she lives for now. She is 
one of the handsome, fascinating society vampires, 
who make great capital out of matrimonial infelici- 
ties, to appeal to the sympathies of really good 
and generous men, who are the more easily caught 
in the silken nets. One day she leaves her worth- 
less drunken husband, when his money is all spent, 
and elopes with a young fellow of excellent family 
who has just come into a fortune, and later be- 
comes one of the adventuresses that disgrace 
Americans in the eyes of European propriety. 

Ben and Delia go abroad, - - Ben in the interest of 
his paper, which is next to his wife ; Delia to write 
travel letters for a weekly, and find material for her 
novel. It is quite a picnic, and they enjoy the 
economies. 

Then the clouds that have been gathering a long, 
long while, break over the country, and all is 
tumult from end to end. The Seventh Regiment 
u boys " go down to Washington, with brave, 
laughing, high-hearted Jim, who understands that 
it is no child's play, but a bitter struggle that will 
call forth the best energies of the country, and who 
enlists for u three years or the whole war." Ben 
hurries home, and takes his place in the ranks. 
When things are at their lowest ebb, and men's 
hearts are sinking with fear, quiet, grave John 
buckles on a soldier's haversack and marches 
away. The others have substitutes. 



Ah, what times they were ! It is well that flow- 
ers can spring up on a battlefield. The little girl 
keeps track of her heroes. Kearny, who has seen 
Magenta and Solferino, meets his fate at Chantilly. 
Many another one who has come up to fame, 
many new ones, who are on the march to win or 
die. 

John is wounded, patched up in a hospital, and 
honorably discharged, lamed for life. But he has 
done good work. Ben has a slight mishap, and 
Delia sends her two babies and their nurse to her 
sister's, and goes to the hospital, and remains. 
Women of brains and kindly impulses are much 
needed. 

And one night some wounded are brought in. 
There has been a fateful reconnoisance, but it has 
saved the regiment from destruction on the next 
day. This limp figure in a captain's uniform is 
laid tenderly on a cot ; but the surgeon, after a brief 
examination, shakes his head. Oh, surely, she 
knows that handsome face with the clustering dark 
curls ! 

He opens his eyes, and after an instant says in 
a faint voice, "Oh, Dele, is that you?' then 
lapses into insensibility. There is nothing to be 
done; that is the crudest of all. Once again, 
after a long while, he moves his head, and opens 
his eyes again, brave and clear even in death. 

" Delia," in a strange, strong voice that surprises 
her, " kiss them all good-night for me ; ' and 
James Odell Underhill has gone to the land of 
everlasting morning. 


The war ends ; and Ben comes home none the 
worse. He has reached his ambition, and is a 
" newspaper man ' in every sense of the word* 
Delia sets up housekeeping, takes home the babies, 
and in the course of time adds two more to them. 

But there is another ferment, and women are 
coming to the fore. There are clubs and suffrage 
meetings, lectures ; women have even invaded 
churches, and preach ; and colleges for higher 
education are springing up everywhere. There are 
poets and philosophers, there are teachers and 
orators ; some of them ill-judged, because they 
are fond of notoriety ; but there are always some 
wry sheep in the best of flocks. Have men always 
been honest and wise and honourable and grand? 

Delia lectures and writes, and is one of the 
able women of the day. Mrs. Hoffman on her 
serene heights is mortified. Mother Underhill is 
sure Ben has to go to a restaurant, that his stock- 
ings are never mended, his buttons always off. But 
patent buttons are invented, and collar-buttons that 
cannot be ironed off by the " washerwoman," 
supply a long-felt want. Ben is stout and comfort- 
able-looking, and the same grave, affectionate 
fellow. The children seem to come up without 
much sickness or trouble. When Mother Under- 
hill feels disposed to cavil and criticise, for she is 
shocked by the new woman's heresies, she recalls 
the " last good-night kiss," and is silent. What if 
there had been no one at hand to bring it home? 
Delia's girls grow up into " modern women." It 
is true they do not spend half a day a week darning 



stockings, neither have they learned to put the 
exquisite over and under darns in tablecloths that 
the little girl could do by the time she was ten. 
But they sing and play; they are ready speech- 
makers, and clubs are glad to get them. They 
know about Greek antiquities and Central American 
wonders ; they can take up the questions of the day 
intelligently; one paints really very well, and has 
entered pictures at the Academy. One is interested 
in industrial schools for girls, and the doctor, who 
is " Daisy Jasper," a tall, bright, good-looking 
woman, has a big, tender heart for all babies who 
are suffering, and trains many a poor mother how 
to care judiciously for her offspring. 

But all the nieces think Aunt Nan just the love- 
liest and sweetest body in the world. They send 
her flowers and bric-a-brac ; they beg her to come 
here and there to receptions and charity bazaars, 
and reunions of all sorts. She is so small and 
dainty, and they are all growing up to the new 
stature. 

George has come home at last, after varying 
fortunes. He has seen San Francisco built and 
destroyed by fire, and rebuilt, and at last planned 
into a handsome city. He has mined and been in 
the wild life known only to the few remaining 
" forty-niners." He has gained and lost, been 
burned out and robbed, been one of the heads of 
a Vigilance Committee, and mayor of a town ; and 
at last, when all is serene and prosperous, a groat 
wave of homesickness overtakes him. 

It is twenty years since he went away, though 

he has been home once in the time. He is spare, 
and has a weather-beaten look, and is old for his 
years. Is the money worth all the sacrifice ? ' 

He will build a house on their part of the old 
farm at Yonkers, where his heart has turned in 
many a weary hour ; but Uncle Paid and Aunt 
Crete are dead. Barton Finch and Retty are 
living in town, and Barton is a thriving manu- 
facturer. Yonkers has stretched out; and the 
suburbs are in that ugly transition state of new 
unworked streets and dingy cottages, for property 
has been cut up and lots sold cheaply. Father 
Underhill is offered a great price for his, and sells 
it. It is no longer George's ideal home. 

Mrs. Eustis begs him to come up to Tarrytown. 
All the other Morgans are gone, and she is left 
alone. The place shall belong to George if he 
will give her a home her few remaining years. 

He will not listen to this, but buys it, and builds 
on a new part. Then he marries a nice girl whose 
youth is past, and who is delighted with her kindly, 
indulgent husband. They have no children; but 
the nieces and nephews flock hither for rest and 
recreation, and are always fascinated with Uncle 
George's adventures. 

Delia is at middle life when she writes her book, 
but then it is no young girl's story with an imperi- 
ous Rochester-like hero, that we used to shiver 
over and adore. It is a serious, inspiriting woman's 
book, and carries weight in spite of the flood of 
new literature. 

Charles Reed has followed a manly, pure, and 


high-minded Christian course, and left an impress 
on the hurrying world. Josie has grown broader 
and more intelligent, and made a delightful house- 
hold mother. There have been children enough 


to satisfy Grandmamma Reed. 

These old friends meet now and then, and talk as 
people will when they begin to go down the de- 
cline on the other side of the hill that they climbed 
with such a light step and high heart. How 
simple life was then compared with the ramifica- 
tions of to-day ! 

The old songs, the old poets, the old novelists 
are gone. "Jane Eyre " no longer holds us spell- 
bound, though the three sisters in the bleak old 
Haworth Rectory will never be forgotten ; nor that 
strange " Rosemary," and Huntingdon's " Lady 
Alice," thought to be so unsettling to the faith. 
We read " Robert Elsmere," and "John Ward, 
Preacher," and go our way tranquilly. Education 
has become almost a synonym for genius. 

The gold of the Pacific Coast, the oil wells, the 
rich spoils of the earth, have been touched with the 
wand of industry and science. Railroads run to 
and fro ; vessels dot the ocean ; we cross it now in 
less than a week. Cables bring us hour-old news 
from everywhere. We go abroad for seasons and 
touch elbows with royalty, and are not abashed. 
We gather the beauty and wisdom of the old 
world. We build palaces, and spend on an eve- 
ning's entertainment what would have been a 
fortune fifty years ago. We have private palace- 
cars, and luxurious yachts for pleasure, and others 

 

for speed, so swift that the " America's Cup " has 
remained in our keeping all these years. 

Will we presently utter the old cry of the wise 
man who " gat him everything," " that all is vanity " ? 

When the children are asleep the little grand- 
mother goes down to her son's study. He is not 
ambitious for show or wealth, but he has a rather 
luxurious side. The rugs are soft; the chairs are 
easy, the library is filled with choice books. Some- 
times she sits and reads, and brave old Thackeray 
is one of her favourites. It is as her lover said, - - it 
takes years and experience to see all the tender, 
hidden mysteries of his best speech. 

Then she puts aside her book, and he his work, 
and they talk. " What your father said " and " your 
father thought this way," always has a charm for 
him, and he misses his father more than any one 
can imagine. He knows about the trip to Ger- 
many, and the visit to grandfather, with Paris at its 
highest estate and the beautiful Empress Eugenie. 
And London with its Queen, who has reigned sixty 
years, and who, like his mother, has made part of 
the pilgrimage with a great sorrow buried in her 
heart. Some day he is going over it all ; but he 
will not see the handsome, golden-haired empress, 
who is but a pale, sorrowful ghost, and perhaps not 
the Queen. He would go to-morrow, if he could 
take the little mother. 

They talk, too, of the future. There have been 
fifty magical years when you look back, - - years of 
discovery, of perfection in art and invention, of 
nations making rapid strides, of Africa illumined 



by explorers, of Japan coming to the front when 
hardly fifty years have elapsed since she first 
opened her gates to strangers. 

And of the great City that has gathered the 
little towns of children who went out from her 
again in her arms, - - will she be beautiful and 
grand and wise, and a power among men and 
cities? She has gathered heroes, living and dead, 
in her bosom, and for the greatest of all reared a 
marble temple. Oh, what will she be in fifty more 
years ?
