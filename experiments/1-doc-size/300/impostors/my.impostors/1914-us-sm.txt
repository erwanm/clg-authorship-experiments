But there was no time to be wasted in fore- 
boding. "About Dr. Overton," I said. "Don't 
you think he had better come?" I ventured to 
add the hint that Mr. van Tuiver would hardly 
wish expense to be considered in such an emer- 
gency; and in the end, I persuaded the doctor 



 

not merely to telegraph for the great surgeon, 
but to ask a hospital in Atlanta to send the near- 
est eye-specialist by the first train. 

We called back Mrs. Tuis, and I apologized 
abjectly for my presumption, and Dr. Perrin 
announced that he thought he ought to see Dr. 
Overton, and another doctor as well. I saw 
fear leap into Aunt Varina's eyes. "Oh, what is 
it?" she cried. "What is the matter with oiu- 
babe?" 

I heli)ed the doctor to answer poUte nothings 
to all her questions. Oh, the poor, dear lady! 
I thought to myself. The poor, dear lady! 
What a tearing away of veils and sentimental 
bandages was written in her book of fate for 
that night! 



 



 

I FIND myself lingering over these prelimi- 
naries, dreading the plunge into the rest of my 
story. We spent our time hovering over the 
child's crib; and in two or three hours the little 
eyeUds had become so inflamed that there could 
no longer be any doubt what was happening. 
We apphed alternate hot and cold cloths, we 
washed the eyes in a solution of boric acid, and 
later, in our desperation, with bluestone. But 
we were dealing with the virulent gonococcus, and 
we neither expected nor obtained much result 
from these measures. In a couple of hours more 
the eyes were beginning to exude pus, and the 
poor infant was wailing in torment. 

"Oh, what can it be? Tell me what is the 
matter?" cried Mrs. Tuis. She sought to catch 
the child in her arms, and when I quickly pre- 
vented her, she turned upon me in anger. "What 
do you mean?" 

"The child must be quiet," I said. 

"But I wish to comfort it!" And when I 
.still insisted, she burst out, wildly, "What right 
have you?" 

"Mrs. Tuis," I said, gently, "it is possible the 
infant may have a very serious infection. If 
so, you would be apt to catch it." 

She answered with a hysterical cry: "My 
precious innocent! Do you think I would be 
afraid of anything it could have?" 




"You may not be afraid, but we are. We 
should have to take care of you, and one case 
is more than enough." 

Suddenly she clutched me by the arm. "Tell 
me what this awful thing is! I demand to 
know!" 

"Mrs. Tuis," said the doctor, interfering, "we 
are not yet sure what the trouble is, we only 
wish to take precautions. It is really imperative 
that you should not handle the child, or even 
go near it. There is nothing you can possibly 
do." 

She was willing to take orders from him: he 
spoke the same dialect as herself, and with the 
same quaint statehness. A charming little South- 
em gentleman — I could realize how Douglas van 
Tuiver had picked him out for his social qual- 
ities. In the old-fashioned Southern medical 
college where he had got his training, I suppose 
they had taught him the old-fashioned idea of 
gonorrhea. Now he was acquiring our extrava 
gant modem notions in the grim school of ex- 
perience. 

It was necessary to put the nurse on her guard 
as to the risks we were running. We should 
have had concave glasses to protect our eyes; 
and we spent part of our time washing our hands 
in bichloride solution. 

"Mrs. Abbott, what is it?" whispered the 
woman. 

"It has a long name," I rephed — "ophthalmia 
neonatorum." 



 

"And what has caused it?" 

"The original cause," I responded, "is a man." 
I was not sure if that was according to the ethics 
of the situation; but the words came. 

Before long the infected eye-sockets were two 
red and yeUow masses of inflammation, and the 
infant was screaming like one of the damned. 
We had to bind up its eyes; I was tempted to 
ask the doctor to give it an opiate, for fear lest 
it should scream itself into convulsions. Then, 
as poor Mrs. Tuis was pacing the floor, wringing 
her hands and sobbing hysterically. Dr. Perrin 
took me to one side and said, "I think she will 
have to be told." 

The poor, poor lady! 

"She might as well understand now as later," 
he continued. "She will have to help keep the 
situation from the mother." 

"Yes," I said; and then, "Who shall tell her?" 

"I think," he replied "that she might prefer 
to be told by a woman." 

So I shut my lips together, and took the dis- 
tracted lady gently by the arm, and led her to 
the door. We stole like two criminals down the 
veranda, and along the path to the beach; and 
near the boat-house we stopped, and I began. 

"Mrs. Tuis, you may remember a circumstance 
which yoiu* niece mentioned to me — that just 
before her marriage she urged you to have cer- 
tain inquiries made as to Mr. van Tuiver's health, 
his fitness for marrie?" 

Never shall I forget her face at that moment. 
"Sylvia told you that!" 



 

"The inquiries were made," I went on, "but not 
carefully enough, it seems. Now you behold the 
consequence of this negligence." 

I saw her blank stare. I added, "The one to 
pay for it is the child." 

"You — you mean — " she stammered, her voice 
hardly a whisper. "Oh — it is impossible!" 
Then, with a flare of indignation, "Do you realize 
what you are implying — that Mr. van Tuiver " 

"There is no question of implying," I said, 
quietly. " It is the facts we have to face now, and 
you will have to help us to face them." 

She cowered and swayed before me, hiding her 
face in her hands. I heard her sobbing, and 
murmuring incoherent cries to her god. I took 
the poor lady's hand, and bore with her as long 
as I could; until, being at the end of my patience 
with prudery and purity and chivalry, and all 
the rest of the highfalutin romanticism of the 
South, I said: "Mrs. Tuis, it is necessary that you 
should get yourself together. You have a serious 
duty before you — that you owe both to Sylvia and 
her child." 

"What is it?" she whispered. The word "duty " 
had motive-power for her. 

" At all hazards, Sylvia must be kept in ignorance 
of the calamity for the present. If she were to 
learn of it, it would quite possibly throw her into 
a fever, and cost her life or the child's. You must 
not make any sound that she can hear, and you 
must not go near her, imtil you have completely 
mastered your emotions." 



 

"Very well," she murmiired. She was really 
a brave little body; but I, not knowing her, and 
thinking only of the peril, was cruel in hammering 
things into her consciousness. Finally I left her, 
seated upon the steps of the deseri«d boat-house, 
rocking back and fori;h and sobbing softly to her- 
self — one of the most pitiful figures it has ever 
been my fori;une to encounter in my prilgrimage 
through a worid of sentimentallty and incompe- 
tence. 


I WENT back to the house, and because we feared 
the soimds of the infant's crying might carry, we 
hung blankets before the doors and windows of the 
room, and sat in the hot enclosure, shuddering, 
silent, grey with fear. After an hour or two, 
Mrs. Tuis rejoined us, stealing in and seating 
herself at one side of the room, staring from one to 
another of us with wide eyes of fright. 

By the time the first signs of dawn appeared, 
the infant had cried itself into a state of exhaustion. 
The faint Ught that got into the room revealed 
the three of us, listening to the pitiful whimpering. 
I was faint with weakness, but I had to make an 
effort and face the worst ordeal of all. There 
came a tapping at the door — the maid, to say that 
Sylvia was awake, and had heard of my arrival, 
and wished to see me. I might have put off our 
meeting for a while, on the plea of exhaustion; 
but I preferred to have it over with, and braced 
myself and went slowly to her room. 

In the doorway I paused for an instant, to 
gaze at her. She was exquisite, lying there 
with the flush of sleep still upon her, and the 
ecstasy of her great achievement in her face. 
I fled to her, and we caught each other in our arms. 

"Oh, Mary, Mary! I'm so glad you've come!" 
And then, "Oh, Mary, isn't it the loveliest baby !" 

"Perfectly glorious!" I exclaimed. 



 

"Oh, I'm so happy — so happy as I never 
dreamed! I've no words to tell you about it." 

"You don't need any words — I've been through 
it," I said. 

"Oh, but she's so beautiful! Tell me — honestly 
— isn't that really so?" 

"My dear," I said, "she is like you." 

"Mary," she went on, half whispering, "I 
think it solves all my problems — all that I wrote 
you about. I don't believe I shall ever be unhappy 
again. I can't believe that such a thing has really 
happened — that I've been given such a treasure. 
And she's my own! I can watch her little body 
grow, and help to make it strong and beautiful! 
I can help mould her little mind — see it opening 
up, one chamber of wonder after another! I can 
teach her all the things I have had to grope so to 
get!" 

"Yes," I said, trying to speak with conviction. 
I added, hastily, "I'm glad you don't find mother- 
hood disappointing." 

"Oh, it's a miracle!" she exclaimed. "A woman 
who could be dissatisfied with anything afterwards 
would be an ingrate!" She paused, then added, 
"Mary, now she's here in the flesh, I feel she'll 
be a bond between Douglas and me. He must 
see her rights, her claim upon life, as he couldn't 
see mine." 

I assented gravely. So that was the thing she 
was thinking most about — a bond between her 
husband and herself! A moment later the 
niue appeared in the door-way, and Sylvia set
