'Just the state of society in which There's a sweet 
little stream running through your meadow, Miss Diana,' 
said the young officer with a sudden change of subject. 
' Where does it go to ? ' 

' It makes a great many turns, through different farms, 
and then joins your river the Yellow River that runs 
round Elmfield.' 

' That's a river ; this brook is just what I like. I got 
tired with my labours this afternoon, and then I threw 
myself down by the side of the water to look at it. I lay 
there till I had almost forgotten what I was about.' 

' Not in your shirt sleeves, just as you was ? ' inquired 
Mrs. Starling. The inquiry drew another laugh from her 
guest ; and he then asked Diana where the brook came 
from ? If it was pretty, followed up ? 

' Very pretty ! ' Diana said. ' As soon as you get 
among the hills and in the woods with it, it is as pretty as 
it can be ; not a bit like what it is here j full of rocks and 
pools and waterfalls ; lovely ! ' 

' Any fish ? ' 

' Beautiful trout.' 

'Miss Diana, can you fish ? ' 

' No. I never tried.' 

' Well, trout fishing is not exactly a thing that comes 
by nature. I must go up that brook. I wish you would 
go and shew me the way. When I see anything pretty, I 
always want some one to point it out to, or I can't half 
enjoy it.' 

' I think it would be the other way,' said Diana. ' I 
should be the one to shew the brook to you.' 



 

' You see if I don't make you find more pretty things 
than you ever knew were there. Come ! is it a bargain ? 
I'll take my line and bring Mrs. Starling some trout.' 

' When > ' said Diana. 

' Seems to me,' said Mrs. Starling, ' I could keep along 
a brook if I could once get hold of it.' 

' Ah,' said Mr. Knowlton laughing, ' you are a great 
deal cleverer than I am. You have no idea how fast I can 
lose myself. Miss Diana, the sooner the better, white this 
lovely weather lasts. Shall we say to-morrow ?' 

' I'll be ready,' said Diana. 

' This weather ain't goin' to change in a hurry,' remarked Mrs. Starling. 

But the remark did not seem to be to the purpose. The 
appointment was made for the following day at three 
o'clock ; and Mr. Knowlton's visit having come to an end, 
he mounted and galloped away. 

'Three o'clock!' said Mrs. Starling. 'Just the heat 
o' the day. And trout, indeed ! Don't you be a silly fish 
yourself, Diana.' 

' Mother ! ' said Diana. 'I couldn't help going, when he 
asked me.' 

' You could ha' helped it if you'd wanted to, I s'pose.' 

Which was.no doubt true, and Diana made no response; 
for she wanted to go. She watched the golden promise of 
dawn the next morning ; she watched the cloudless vault 
of the sky, and secretly rejoiced within herself that she 
would be ready. 



CHAPTER VI. 
MR. KNOWLTON'S FISH. 

DOUBTLESS they were ready, those two, for the brook 
and the afternoon. The young officer came at half past 
three ; not in regimentals this time, but in an easy grey undress and straw hat. He came in a wagon, and he brought 
his fishing-rod and carried a basket. Diana had been ready 
ever since three. They lost no time ; they went out into 
the meadow and struck the brook. 

Now the brook, during its passage through the valley 
field, was remarkable for nothing but a rare infirmity of 
purpose which would never let it keep one course for many 
rods together. It twisted and curled about, making many 
little meadow promontories on one side an d the other ; 
hurrying along with a soft sweet gurgle that sounded 
fresh, even under the heat of the summer sun. It was a 
hot afternoon, as Mrs. Starling had said ; and the two 
excursionists were fain to take it gently and to make as 
straight a course across the fields as keeping on one side 
of the brook left possible. They could not cross it. The 
stream was not large, yet quite too broad for a jump ; and 
not deep, yet deep enough to cover its stony bed and 
leave no crossing stones. So sometimes along the border 
of the brook, where a fringe of long grass had been 
left by the mowers' scythes, rank and tangled ; sometimes 
striking across from bend to bend over the meadow, where 



 

no kindly trees stood to shade them, the two went ; on a 
hunt, as Mr. Knowlton said, after pretty things. 

After a mile or more of this walking, the scenery changed. 
Mown fields, hot and fragrant, were left behind ; almost 
suddenly they entered the hills, where the brook issued 
from them; and then they began a slower tracking of its 
course back among the rocks and woods of a dell which 
soon grew close and wild. The sides of the dell became 
higher ; the bed of the stream more steep and rough ; 
the canopy of trees closed in overhead and shewed the 
blue through only in broken patches. The clothing of the 
hillsides was elegant and exquisite ; oaks and firs and 
hemlocks, with slender birches and maples, lining the 
ravine ; and under them a free growth of ferns, and fresh 
beds of moss, and lovely lichens, covered the rocks and 
dressed the ground. The stream rattled along at the bottom; foaming over the stones and leaping down the rocks ; 
making the still deep pools where the fish love to lie ; 
and in its way executing a succession of cascades and tiny 
waterfalls that wanted no picturesque element except 
magnitude. And a good imagination can supply that. 

And how went the afternoon ? How goes it with those 
who have just received a new sense, or found a sudden doubling of that which they had before ? Nay, it was a new sense, a 
new power of perception, able to discern what had eluded 
all their previous lives. The brook in the meadow had 
been to Diana's vision until now merely running water ; 
whence had come those delicious amber hues, where it 
rolled over the stones, and the deep olive shadows where 
the water was deeper ? She had never seen them before. 
Now, they were pointed out and seen to be rich and clear, 
a sort of dilution of sunlight, with a suggestion of sunlight's other riches of possibility. The rank unmown 



 

grass that fringed the stream, Diana had never seen it but 
as what the scythe had missed ; now she was made to notice what an elegant fringe it was, and how the same sunlight glanced upon its curving stems and blades and set 
off the deep brown stream. Diana's own eyes began to 
be quickened, and her tongue loosed. The lovely outline 
of the hills that encircled the valley had never looked just 
so rare and lovely as this afternoon when she pointed them 
out to her companion, and he scanned them and nodded 
in full assent. But when they got into the ravine, it was 
Diana's turn. Mosses, and old trees, and sharp turns of 
the gorge, and fords, where it was necessary to cross the 
brook and recross on stepping stones just lifting them 
above the water, here black enough, Diana knew all these 
things ; and with secret delight unfolded the knowledge of 
them to her companion as they went along. And still the bits 
of blue sky overhead had never seemed so unearthly blue ; 
the drapery of oak and hemlock boughs had never been 
so graceful and bright ; there_ was a presence in the old 
gorge that afternoon, which went with them and cleared 
their eyes from vapour and their minds from everything, it 
seemed, but a susceptibility to beauty and delight in its influence. Perhaps the young officer would have said that 
this presence was embodied in the unconscious eyes and 
fair calm brow which went beside him ; I think he saw 
them more distinctly than anything else. Diana did not 
know it. Somehow she very rarely looked her companion 
in the face ; and yet she knew very well how his face looked too ; so well perhaps that she did not need to refresh 
her memory. So they wandered on ; and the fords were 
pleasant places, where she had to be helped over the 
stones. Not that Diana needed such help ; her foot was 
fearless and true ; she never had had help there before ; 



 

was that what made it so pleasant ? Certainly it did seem 
to her that it was a prettier way of going up the brook than 
alone and unaided. 

' I am not getting much fish at this rate,' said young 
Knowlton at length with a light laugh. 

' No,' said Diana. ' Why don't you stop and try here ? 
Here looks like a good place. Right in that still, deep 
spot, I dare say there are trout.' 

' What will you do in the mean time, if I stop and fish ? 
it will be very stupid for you.' 

' For me ? O no. I shall sit here and look on. It will 
not be stupid. I will keep still, never fear.' 

' I don't want you to keep still ; that would be very 
stupid for me.' 

' You can't talk while you are fishing ; it would scare 
the trout, you know.' 

' I don't believe it.' 

' I have always heard so.' 

' I don't believe it will pay,' said Knowlton as he fitted 
his rod ' If I am to purchase trout at the expense of all 
that ' 

All what, Diana wondered? 

' Suppose we talk very softly in whispers,' he went on 
laughing. ' Do you suppose the trout are so observant as to 
mind it ? If you sit here, on this mossy stone, close by 
me, can't I enjoy two things at once ? ' 

Diana made no objection to this arrangement. She 
took the place indicated, full of a breathless kind of pleasure 
which she did not stop to analyze ; and watched in silence the 
progress of the fishing. In silence, for after Mr. Knowlton's 
arrangement had been carried into effect, he too subsided 
into stillness ; whether engrossed with the business of his 
line, or satisfied, or with thoughts otherwise engaged, did not 



 

appear. But as presently and again a large trout, -speckled, 
and beautiful, was swung up out of the pool below, the two 
faces were turned towards each other and the two pairs of 
eyes met with a smile of so much sympathy that I rather 
think the temporary absence of words lost nothing to the 
growth of the understanding between them. 

The place where they sat was lovely. Just there the 
bank was high, overhanging the brook. A projecting 
rock, brown and green and grey, with lichen and mosses of 
various kinds, held besides a delicate young silver birch, 
the roots of which found their way to nourishment somehow through fissures in the rock. Here sat Knowlton, with 
Diana beside him on a stone, just a little behind ; while he 
sat on the brink to cast, or rather drop, his line into the 
little pool below where the trout were lurking. The opposite side of the stream was but a few yards off, thick with 
a lovely growth of young wood, with one great hemlock 
not far above towering up towards the sky. The view in 
that direction went up a vista of the ravine, so wood-fringed 
on both sides, with the stream leaping and tumbling down 
a steep rocky bed. Overhead the narrow line of blue 
sky. 

' Four ! ' whispered Diana, as another spotted trout 
came up from the pool. 

' I wonder how many there are down there ? ' said 
Knowlton as he unhooked the fish. ' It makes me hungry-' 

' Catching the trout ? ' said Diana softly. 

He nodded. ' Here comes another. I wish we could 
make a fire somewhere hereabouts and cook them.' 

' Is that a good way ? ' 

' The best in the world,' he said adjusting his fly, and 
then looking with a smile at her. ' There is no way that 



fish taste so good. I used to do that, you see, in the hills 
round about the Academy ; and I know all about it.' 

' We could make a fire,' said Diana ; ' but we have no 
gridiron here.' 

' I had no gridiron there. Couldn't have carried a grid- 
iron in my pocket if I had had one. Here's another ' 

'You had not a gridiron of course.' 

' Nor a pocket either.' 

' But did you eat the trout all alone ? without bread, I 
mean, or anything ? ' 

' No ; we took bread and salt and pepper and butter and 
a few such things. There were generally a lot of us ; or 
if only two or three we could manage that. The butter 
was the worst thing to accomplish Here's another ! '
