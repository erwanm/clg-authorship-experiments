Mamma smiled a little, and examined her 
dress. 

"It was thirty-five cents a yard. They had 
a lovely one for fifty ; and I looked at it until 
the flesh began to grow weak ; then I fortified 
myself by counting my money. And now comes 
the tug of war to get it made." 

"We will all help a little," returned mamma. 

There was a general outcry the next morning 
when Mrs. Whitcomb went away. Everybody 
besieged her to set a day for her return. 

"I'll save out a fortnight for you in Septem- 
ber, if I possibly can," she said, with her 
sweetest smile. "I hope no one will be sick 
then, and we will have a good, old-fashioned 
visiting time. Take the best care you can of 
my patient, Rose." 

I gathered some fresh flowers and carried 
them up first of all. Louis nodded his head in 
thanks. 

"I am so sorry Mrs. Whitcomb had to go!' 
I said, by way of making conversation. 

"I liked her so much! Do you know 
whether any one has written to Stephen ? ' 



 



" Papa did. He waited until you were out of 
danger, since he could not send for him." 

"I suppose he would not have cared much 
either way ; ' and the thin lip curled. 

" Pardon me. I think he has a great deal of 
love for you. lie was so considerate of your 
comfort and health when he was here ! ' 

" Seemed to be, you mean. When you have 
learned more of the world, Miss Rose, you will 
know that there is a good share of glitter that 
is not gold. He and Stuart would have had 
ever so much more money." 

"You wrong them both. You are unjust to 
them." 

"O," he said, rather sneeringly, "you girls 
can get up quite a sentiment for each other ; 
but boys take a thing for what it is worth. 
Neither of them loves me ; and I can't say 
there is much love lost between us." 

"I wish you felt differently about them. 
And you have just been so ill, too ! ' 

" I told him that I wouldn't go nor stay with 
Stuart. He torments my very life out. I begged 
him to send me somewhere else. And no, ho 
would not. lie treats me as if I were about 
ten years old, and did not know what was best 

for myself. He cannot think that I am almost 
as much of a man as he is ! ' 

He uttered this in a rapid breath, and then 
gasped from exhaustion. 

"Don't excite yourself so," I pleaded. "If 
you could have heard Stephen talk of you 
when he was here ! He begged us to make it 
as pleasant and take as much interest in you as 
we could." 

"You have been very kind. I do not want 
to be ungrateful ; but he doesn't care for me in 
that way. He thwarts every plan, he refuses 
every wish, and did not even want me to try 
for college. He would like to keep me a little 
boy at school half my life, I do believe." 

I went around pretending to tidy the room a 
bit ; but Mrs. Whitcomb had left it as neat as 
a pin. I could not bear to have him talk this 
way against Stephen. Then I espied a book, 
and asked if I should read to him. 

"If you will," was the rather indifferent 
answer. 

But he was soon quite interested. He turned 
towards me, and his eyes grew eager, and over 
his whole face came a peaceful light. It seemed 
then as if there was quite a resemblance between 



 

him and the elder brother, for I remembered 
that Stephen had a stern way of shutting his 
mouth. Louis's eyes were dark, and that 
gave him a more desperate look when he was 
angry. 

He was very full of whims and wants, but a 
while after dinner concluded he would take a 
nap. As baby Edith had gone to peaceful slum- 
bers, and Nelly sat in the nursery, mamma had 
taken this opportunity to begin cutting Fan's 
dress. So I joined the conclave, and helped 
discuss the momentous question. 

Mamma was a born genius. I don't know 
which gift or grace was the strongest. I think 
she must have had a very evenly-balanced head. 
And yet she used to tell us how really helpless she 
was at her marriage. She had lived with a great- 
aunt, who was a whimsical invalid, and did 
nothing but go to school, and read to, or amuse, 
her. Still, I suppose, she learned those grand 
lessons of sweetness and patience which helped so 
much in her after-life. And when she had to do, 
she went to work bravely. She could cook 
equal to anybody in the parish ; she could make 
dresses and bonnets ; and when you came to the 
altering, she was superb. That was why I called 


 

her a Lorn genius. Then she had kept up with 
her music to some extent, and painted a little 
in water colors. Three of papa's birthday gifts 
had been pictures of her painting ; and some of 
the daintiest fruit-pieces in our dining-room were 
done by her in colored crayons on a tinted back- 
ground. No wonder we were proud of her. 

Now we talked about overskirt and underskirt, 
basque, and ruffles, and bands, and trimmings of 
various kinds. 

"It is quite a fearful undertaking," said Fan, 
with a sigh. "If I had a little more courage, 
I'd make it perfectly plain ; but, then, when I 
went out and saw other people all furbelows 
and frills, I am afraid I should be dissatisfied. 
And no one would believe it was a new dress." 

" It is better to take a little more trouble, 
and be satisfied. But I would not have any 
ruffles- -they are so difficult to iron." 

"Not even one on the skirt?' 

"No. I should cut a bias piece in points, and 
bind them ; or you could have two narrow ones." 

"And I will bind them, as you cannot do 
that on the machine very well," I said. 

"You are a good girl, Rose of the World. 
Mamma, I think I'll have a polonaise." 



 

"A sensible conclusion. It will make a nice 
outside garment for all summer." 

"And I will just point the sleeves and the skirt. 
There is cheap trimming for you. Give me 
credit for another bright idea. And a bias-band 
pointed on both sides for the underskirt. So 
there is the whole garment provided for. Then 
I shall have another errand to the store, to get 
some pique braid ; ' and Fan gave a droll little 
smile. 

Mamma began to cut. Fan opened the ma- 
chine, and sewed the skirt breadths together. 
The trimming was measured, and she shaped the 
points to her fancy. Then mamma fitted the 
waist with fingers as deft as any modiste. 

" Mamma, if you were reduced to absolute 
penury, you could set up dress-making," Fanny 
said. 

" I have found it very useful without the 
absolute penury," returned mamma, with a wise 
smile. "When one has seven girls, a good 
many dresses are needed.' 

"Are you sorry there are so many of us?' 

" I do not know which one I would like to 
give up," was the grave reply. 

"It would be like the Irishman with his flock 



 

wouldn't it ? Every one of us has some special 
gift or grace. Mine is simply a grace winning 
ways and curly hair. O, there's Miss Churchill, 
and this hall all in a litter ! ' 

The hall was so wide and airy that we used 
to sit there and sew in the summer. Mamma 
was cutting on the table ; so she just gathered 
the pieces together, and pushed out papa's 
chintz-covered arm-chair. I sat by the window, 
crocheting some tiny garments for baby Edith. 
Fan opened the hall door wide before Miss 
Churchill could ring to announce herself. Mam- 
ma shook hands with her cordially. 

The Churchills were some of the old families 
in the town. Oddly enough, they had never 
intermarried with their neighbors, but kept to 
themselves, and were considered rather haughty 
and exclusive. They lived over on the west 
side, which was the aristocratic part of the 
town, there being no mills or factories near. 

Miss Esther Churchill, our visitor, was a tall, 
elegant woman of perhaps forty-five. Mr. 
Kenton Churchill, the head of the family, was 
about ten years older. Next to him came Mrs. 
Ogden, who had lived abroad a great deal, and 
\vas now a widow, but wealthy, with one son 



 

and one daughter. Then there was Miss Lucy, 
much younger, an invalid, injured quite early 
in life by being thrown from a horse. They 
were refined and particularly nice people, with 
those little formal ways that always kept us in 
awe. Their house was very handsome, and it 
seemed as if they must have everything that 
heart could wish for. They always paid for 
two of the best pews in church, one of which 
they used, while the other was considered free. 
Then Mr. Churchill subscribed liberally to nearly 
every charitable object ; but, somehow, they 
never mixed much with the congregation ; yet 
they were always spoken of in the highest terms. 
Papa and mamma were always invited over to 
tea once a year, and they called occasionally. 
Miss Esther had made a state call upon baby 
Edith, bringing her a handsome cap and cloak, 
Mamma had not returned that; so we were a 
little surprised, and, to use a provincialism, 
"put about," for an instant. But mamma lias? 
such a wonderful grace and self-possession that 
there was no awkwardness. 

"How do you do, young ladies? Quite busy, 
I see ; ' and she shook hands with both. " How 
cosy and summery you look here. Why, it i 
quite like a picture ! ' 



 

The broad hall was covered with matting, 
There was a large, old-fashioned hat-stand on 
one side, very much like the beautiful new ones 
coming into fashion. It had quite a large glass, 
and drawers under it, with branching arms out 
both sides. On either side of it was a quaint, 
high-backed chair. They might haA^e come over 
in the Mayflower, but I don't suppose they 
did. A tall vase of ivy stood on the floor, the 
green branches climbing over some picture-frames; 
and there were several brackets hanjnno; about, 


holding vases of flowers, besides a luxuriant 
fernery, that had received contributions from all
