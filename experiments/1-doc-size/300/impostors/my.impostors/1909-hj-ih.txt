merit of everything you enjoy must be that it suits you absolutely; but
the larger half here is generally that it has suited some one else and
that you can never flatter yourself you have discovered it. It has been
addressed to some use a million miles out of your range, and has had
great adventures before ever condescending to please you. It was in
admission of this truth that my discriminating friend who showed me the
Claudes found it impossible to designate a certain delightful region
which you enter at the end of an hour’s riding from Porta Cavalleggieri
as anything but Arcadia. The exquisite correspondence of the term in
this case altogether revived its faded bloom; here veritably the oaten
pipe must have stirred the windless air and the satyrs have laughed
among the brookside reeds. Three or four long grassy dells stretch away
in a chain between low hills over which delicate trees are so discreetly
scattered that each one is a resting place for a shepherd. The elements
of the scene are simple enough, but the composition has extraordinary
refinement. By one of those happy chances which keep observation in
Italy always in her best humour a shepherd had thrown himself down under
one of the trees in the very attitude of Meliboeus. He had been washing
his feet, I suppose, in the neighbouring brook, and had found it
pleasant afterwards to roll his short breeches well up on his thighs.
Lying thus in the shade, on his elbow, with his naked legs stretched out
on the turf and his soft peaked hat over his long hair crushed back
like the veritable bonnet of Arcady, he was exactly the figure of the
background of this happy valley. The poor fellow, lying there in
rustic weariness and ignorance, little fancied that he was a symbol of
old-world meanings to new-world eyes.

Such eyes may find as great a store of picturesque meanings in the
cork-woods of Monte Mario, tenderly loved of all equestrians. These are
less severely pastoral than our Arcadia, and you might more properly
lodge there a damosel of Ariosto than a nymph of Theocritus. Among them
is strewn a lovely wilderness of flowers and shrubs, and the whole place
has such a charming woodland air, that, casting about me the other day
for a compliment, I declared that it reminded me of New Hampshire. My
compliment had a double edge, and I had no sooner uttered it than I
smiled--or sighed--to perceive in all the undiscriminated botany about
me the wealth of detail, the idle elegance and grace of Italy alone, the
natural stamp of the land which has the singular privilege of making one
love her unsanctified beauty all but as well as those features of one’s
own country toward which nature’s small allowance doubles that of one’s
own affection. For this effect of casting a spell no rides have more
value than those you take in Villa Doria or Villa Borghese; or don’t
take, possibly, if you prefer to reserve these particular regions--the
latter in especial--for your walking hours. People do ride, however,
in both villas, which deserve honourable mention in this regard. Villa
Doria, with its noble site, its splendid views, its great groups of
stone-pines, so clustered and yet so individual, its lawns and flowers
and fountains, its altogether princely disposition, is a place where one
may pace, well mounted, of a brilliant day, with an agreeable sense of
its being rather a more elegant pastime to balance in one’s stirrups
than to trudge on even the smoothest gravel. But at Villa Borghese
the walkers have the best of it; for they are free of those adorable
outlying corners and bosky byways which the rumble of barouches never
reaches. In March the place becomes a perfect epitome of the spring.
You cease to care much for the melancholy greenness of the disfeatured
statues which has been your chief winter’s intimation of verdure; and
before you are quite conscious of the tender streaks and patches in the
great quaint grassy arena round which the Propaganda students, in their
long skirts, wander slowly, like dusky seraphs revolving the gossip of
Paradise, you spy the brave little violets uncapping their azure brows
beneath the high-stemmed pines. One’s walks here would take us too far,
and one’s pauses detain us too long, when in the quiet parts under
the wall one comes across a group of charming small school-boys in
full-dress suits and white cravats, shouting over their play in clear
Italian, while a grave young priest, beneath a tree, watches them over
the top of his book. It sounds like nothing, but the force behind it and
the frame round it, the setting, the air, the chord struck, make it a
hundred wonderful things.

1873.





ROMAN NEIGHBOURHOODS


I made a note after my first stroll at Albano to the effect that I had
been talking of the “picturesque” all my life, but that now for a change
I beheld it. I had been looking all winter across the Campagna at the
free-flowing outline of the Alban Mount, with its half-dozen towns
shining on its purple side even as vague sun-spots in the shadow of
a cloud, and thinking it simply an agreeable incident in the varied
background of Rome. But now that during the last few days I have been
treating it as a foreground, have been suffering St. Peter’s to play
the part of a small mountain on the horizon, with the Campagna swimming
mistily through the ambiguous lights and shadows of the interval, I find
the interest as great as in the best of the by-play of Rome. The walk
I speak of was just out of the village, to the south, toward the
neighbouring town of L’Ariccia, neighbouring these twenty years, since
the Pope (the late Pope, I was on the point of calling him) threw his
superb viaduct across the deep ravine which divides it from Albano. At
the risk of seeming to fantasticate I confess that the Pope’s having
built the viaduct--in this very recent antiquity--made me linger there
in a pensive posture and marvel at the march of history and at Pius the
Ninth’s beginning already to profit by the sentimental allowances we
make to vanished powers. An ardent nero then would have had his own
way with me and obtained a frank admission that the Pope was indeed a
father to his people. Far down into the charming valley which slopes out
of the ancestral woods of the Chigis into the level Campagna winds the
steep stone-paved road at the bottom of which, in the good old days,
tourists in no great hurry saw the mules and oxen tackled to their
carriage for the opposite ascent. And indeed even an impatient tourist
might have been content to lounge back in his jolting chaise and look
out at the mouldy foundations of the little city plunging into the
verdurous flank of the gorge. Questioned, as a cherisher of quaintness,
as to the best “bit” hereabouts, I should certainly name the way in
which the crumbling black houses of these ponderous villages plant their
weary feet on the flowery edges of all the steepest chasms. Before you
enter one of them you invariably find yourself lingering outside its
pretentious old gateway to see it clutched and stitched to the stony
hillside by this rank embroidery of the wildest and bravest things that
grow. Just at this moment nothing is prettier than the contrast between
their dusky ruggedness and the tender, the yellow and pink and violet
fringe of that mantle. All this you may observe from the viaduct at
the Ariccia; but you must wander below to feel the full force of the
eloquence of our imaginary papalino. The pillars and arches of
pale grey peperino arise in huge tiers with a magnificent spring and
solidity. The older Romans built no better; and the work has a deceptive
air of being one of their sturdy bequests which help one to drop
another sigh over the antecedents the Italians of to-day are so eager to
repudiate. Will those they give their descendants be as good?

At the Ariccia, in any case, I found a little square with a couple of
mossy fountains, occupied on one side by a vast dusky-faced Palazzo
Chigi and on the other by a goodly church with an imposing dome.
The dome, within, covers the whole edifice and is adorned with some
extremely elegant stucco-work of the seventeenth century. It gave a
great value to this fine old decoration that preparations were going
forward for a local festival and that the village carpenter was hanging
certain mouldy strips of crimson damask against the piers of the vaults.
The damask might have been of the seventeenth century too, and a group
of peasant-women were seeing it unfurled with evident awe. I regarded
it myself with interest--it seemed so the tattered remnant of a fashion
that had gone out for ever. I thought again of the poor disinherited
Pope, wondering whether, when such venerable frippery will no longer
bear the carpenter’s nails, any more will be provided. It was hard to
fancy anything but shreds and patches in that musty tabernacle. Wherever
you go in Italy you receive some such intimation as this of the shrunken
proportions of Catholicism, and every church I have glanced into on my
walks hereabouts has given me an almost pitying sense of it. One finds
one’s self at last--without fatuity, I hope--feeling sorry for the
solitude of the remaining faithful. It’s as if the churches had been
made so for the world, in its social sense, and the world had so
irrevocably moved away. They are in size out of all modern proportion to
the local needs, and the only thing at all alive in the melancholy waste
they collectively form is the smell of stale incense. There are pictures
on all the altars by respectable third-rate painters; pictures which I
suppose once were ordered and paid for and criticised by worshippers who
united taste with piety. At Genzano, beyond the Ariccia, rises on the
grey village street a pompous Renaissance temple whose imposing nave
and aisles would contain the population of a capital. But where is the
taste of the Ariccia and Genzano? Where are the choice spirits for
whom Antonio Raggi modelled the garlands of his dome and a hundred
clever craftsmen imitated Guido and Caravaggio? Here and there, from the
pavement, as you pass, a dusky crone interlards her devotions with more
profane importunities, or a grizzled peasant on rusty-jointed knees,
tilted forward with his elbows on a bench, reveals the dimensions of
the patch in his blue breeches. But where is the connecting link between
Guido and Caravaggio and those poor souls for whom an undoubted original
is only a something behind a row of candlesticks, of no very clear
meaning save that you must bow to it? You find a vague memory of it at
best in the useless grandeurs about you, and you seem to be looking at a
structure of which the stubborn earth-scented foundations alone remain,
with the carved and painted shell that bends above them, while the
central substance has utterly crumbled away.

I shall seem to have adopted a more meditative pace than befits a brisk
constitutional if I say that I also fell a-thinking before the shabby
façade of the old Chigi Palace. But it seemed somehow in its grey
forlornness to respond to the sadly superannuated expression of the
opposite church; and indeed in any condition what self-respecting
cherisher of quaintness can forbear to do a little romancing in the
shadow of a provincial palazzo? On the face of the matter, I know,
there is often no very salient peg to hang a romance on. A sort of dusky
blankness invests the establishment, which has often a rather imbecile
old age. But a hundred brooding secrets lurk in this inexpressive mask,
and the Chigi Palace did duty for me in the suggestive twilight as
the most haunted of houses. Its basement walls sloped outward like the
beginning of a pyramid, and its lower windows were covered with massive
iron cages. Within the doorway, across the court, I saw the pale glimmer
of flowers on a terrace, and I made much, for the effect of the roof, of
a great covered loggia or belvedere with a dozen window-panes missing
or mended with paper. Nothing gives one a stronger impression of old
manners than an ancestral palace towering in this haughty fashion over
a shabby little town; you hardly stretch a point when you call it an
impression of feudalism. The scene may pass for feudal to American eyes,
for which a hundred windows on a facade mean nothing more exclusive than
a hotel kept (at the most invidious) on the European plan. The mouldy
grey houses on the steep crooked street, with their black cavernous
archways pervaded by bad smells, by the braying of asses and by human
intonations hardly more musical, the haggard and tattered peasantry
staring at you with hungry-heavy eyes, the brutish-looking monks
(there are still enough to point a moral), the soldiers, the mounted
constables, the dirt, the dreariness, the misery, and the dark
over-grown palace frowning over it all from barred window and guarded
gateway--what more than all this do we dimly descry in a mental image of
the dark ages? For all his desire to keep the peace with the vivid image
of things if it be only vivid enough, the votary of this ideal may well
occasionally turn over such values with the wonder of what one takes
them as paying for. They pay sometimes for such sorry “facts of life.”
 At Genzano, out of the very midst of the village squalor, rises the
Palazzo Cesarini, separated from its gardens by a dirty lane. Between
peasant and prince, the contact is unbroken, and one would suppose
Italian good-nature sorely taxed by their mutual allowances; that the
prince in especial must cultivate a firm impervious shell. There are
no comfortable townsfolk about him to remind him of the blessings of a
happy mediocrity of fortune. When he looks out of his window he sees a
battered old peasant against a sunny wall sawing off his dinner from a
hunch of black bread.

I must confess, however, that “feudal” as it amused me to find the
little piazza of the Ariccia, it appeared to threaten in no manner an
exasperated rising. On the contrary, the afternoon being cool, many of
the villagers were contentedly muffled in those ancient cloaks, lined
with green baize, which, when tossed over the shoulder and surmounted
with a peaked hat, form one of the few lingering remnants of “costume”
 in Italy; others were tossing wooden balls light-heartedly enough on the
grass outside the town. The egress on this side is under a great stone
archway thrown out from the palace and surmounted with the family arms.
Nothing could better confirm your theory that the townsfolk are groaning
serfs. The road leads away through the woods, like many of the roads
hereabouts, among trees less remarkable for their size than for their
picturesque contortions and posturings. The woods, at the moment at
which I write, are full of the raw green light of early spring, a jour
vastly becoming to the various complexions of the wild flowers that
cover the waysides. I have never seen these untended parterres in such
lovely exuberance; the sturdiest pedestrian becomes a lingering idler if
he allows them to catch his eye. The pale purple cyclamen, with its hood
thrown back, stands up in masses as dense as tulip-beds; and here and
there in the duskier places great sheets of forget-me-not seem to exhale
a faint blue mist. These are the commonest plants; there are dozens
more I know no name for--a rich profusion in especial of a beautiful
five-petalled flower whose white texture is pencilled with hair-strokes
certain fair copyists I know of would have to hold their breath to
imitate. An Italian oak has neither the girth nor the height of its
English brothers, but it contrives in proportion to be perhaps even
more effective. It crooks its back and twists its arms and clinches its
hundred fists with the queerest extravagance, and wrinkles its bark
into strange rugosities from which its first scattered sprouts of yellow
green seem to break out like a morbid fungus. But the tree which has the
greatest charm to northern eyes is the cold grey-green ilex, whose clear
crepuscular shade drops against a Roman sun a veil impenetrable, yet not
oppressive. The ilex has even less colour than the cypress, but it is
much less funereal, and a landscape in which it is frequent may still
be said to smile faintly, though by no means to laugh. It abounds in
old Italian gardens, where the boughs are trimmed and interlocked into
vaulted corridors in which, from point to point, as in the niches of
some dimly frescoed hall, you see mildewed busts stare at you with a
solemnity which the even grey light makes strangely intense. A
humbler relative of the ilex, though it does better things than help
broken-nosed emperors to look dignified, is the olive, which covers many
of the neighbouring hillsides with its little smoky puffs of foliage. A
stroke of composition I never weary of is that long blue stretch of the
Campagna which makes a high horizon and rests on this vaporous base of
olive-tops. A reporter intent upon a simile might liken it to the ocean
seen above the smoke of watch-fires kindled on the strand.

To do perfect justice to the wood-walk away from the Ariccia I ought
to touch upon the birds that were singing vespers as I passed. But the
reader would find my rhapsody as poor entertainment as the programme of
a concert he had been unable to attend. I have no more learning about
bird-music than would help me to guess that a dull dissyllabic refrain
in the heart of the wood came from the cuckoo; and when at moments I
heard a twitter of fuller tone, with a more suggestive modulation,
I could only hope it was the nightingale. I have listened for the
nightingale more than once in places so charming that his song would
have seemed but the articulate expression of their beauty, and have
never heard much beyond a provoking snatch or two--a prelude that came
to nothing. In spite of a natural grudge, however, I generously believe
him a great artist or at least a great genius--a creature who despises
any prompting short of absolute inspiration. For the rich, the
multitudinous melody around me seemed but the offering to my ear of the
prodigal spirit of tradition. The wood was ringing with sound because it
was twilight, spring and Italy. It was also because of these good things
and various others besides that I relished so keenly my visit to the
Capuchin convent upon which I emerged after half-an-hour in the wood.
It stands above the town on the slope of the Alban Mount, and its wild
garden climbs away behind it and extends its melancholy influence.
Before it is a small stiff avenue of trimmed live-oaks which conducts
you to a grotesque little shrine beneath the staircase ascending to the
church. Just here, if you are apt to grow timorous at twilight, you may
take a very pretty fright; for as you draw near you catch behind the
grating of the shrine the startling semblance of a gaunt and livid monk.
A sickly lamplight plays down upon his face, and he stares at you from
cavernous eyes with a dreadful air of death in life. Horror of horrors,
you murmur, is this a Capuchin penance? You discover of course in a
moment that it is only a Capuchin joke, that the monk is a pious dummy
and his spectral visage a matter of the paint-brush. You resent his
intrusion on the surrounding loveliness; and as you proceed to demand
entertainment at their convent you pronounce the Capuchins very foolish
fellows. This declaration, as I made it, was supported by the conduct of
the simple brother who opened the door of the cloister in obedience to
my knock and, on learning my errand, demurred about admitting me at
so late an hour. If I would return on the morrow morning he’d be most
happy. He broke into a blank grin when I assured him that this was the
very hour of my desire and that the garish morning light would do no
justice to the view. These were mysteries beyond his ken, and it was
only his good-nature (of which he had plenty) and not his imagination
