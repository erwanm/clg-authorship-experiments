" Yes," answers the head of the party, " going to 
Gloucester." 

" Guess not," says, very coldly and decidedly, 
one of the passengers, who is reading that morning's 
"Advertiser ; " and when the subject of this surmise 
looks at him for explanations, he adds, " The City 
Council has chartered the boat for to-day." 

Upon this the excursionists fall into great dismay 
and bitterness, and upbraid the City Council, and 
wonder why last night's " Transcript " said nothing 
about its oppressive action, and generally bewail 
their fate. But at last they resolve to go some- 
where, and, being set down, they make up their 
warring minds upon Nahant, for the Nahant boat 
leaves the wharf nearest them ; and so they hurry 
away to India Wharf, amidst barrels and bales and 
boxes and hacks and trucks, with interminable string- 
teams passing before them at every crossing. 

" At any rate," says the leader of the expedition, 
" we shall see the Gardens of Maolis, — those en- 
chanted gardens which have fairly been advertised 
into my dreams, and where I've been told," he 
continues, with an effort to make the prospect an 
attractive one, yet not without a sense of the meagre- 
ness of the materials, "they have a grotto and a 
wooden bull." 

Of course, there is no reason in nature why a 
wooden bull should be more pleasing than a flesh- 




and-blood bull, but it seems to encourage the com 
pany, and they set off again with renewed speed, 
and at last reach India Wharf in time to see the 
Nahant steamer packed full of excursionists, with a 
crowd of people still waiting to go aboard. It does 
not look inviting, and they hesitate. In a minute 
or two their spirits sink so low, that if they should 
see the wooden bull step out of a grotto on the deck 
of the steamer the spectacle could not revive them. 
At that instant they think, with a surprising single- 
ness, of Nantasket Beach, and the bright colors in 
which the Gardens of Maolis but now appeared fade 
away, and they seem to see themselves sauntering 
along the beautiful shore, while the white-crested 
breakers crash upon the sand, and run up 

" In tendei-cnrving lines of creamy spray," 

quite to the feet of that lotus-eating party. 

"Nahant is all rocks," says the leader to Aunt 
Mehssa, who hears him with a sweet and tranquil 
patience, and who would enjoy or suffer anything 
with the same expression; "and as you've never 
yet seen the open sea, it's fortunate that we go to 
Nantasket, for, of course, a beach is more character- 
istic. But now the object is to get there. The boat 
will be starting in a few moments, and I doubt 
whether we can walk it. How far is it," he asks, 
turning toward a respectable-looking man, " to Liv- 
erpool Wharf?" 

" Well, it's consid'able ways," says the man, smil- 
ing. 




" Then we must take a hack," says the pleasurer 
to his party. " Come on." 

" I've got a hack," observes the man, in a casual 
way, as if the fact might possibly interest. 

" O, you have, have you ? Well, then, put us 
into it, and drive to Liverpool Wharf; and hurry." 

Either the distance was less than the hackman 
fancied, or else he drove thither with unheard-of 
speed, for two minutes later he set them down on 
Liverpool Wharf. But swiftly as they had come 
the steamer had been even more prompt, and she 
now turned toward them a beautiful wake, as she 
pushed farther and farther out into the harbor. 

The hackman took his two dollars for his four 
passengers, and was rapidly mounting his box, — 
probably to avoid idle reproaches. " Wait ! " said 
the chief pleasurer. Then, " When does the next 
boat leave ? " he asked of the agent, who had 
emerged with a compassionate face from the waiting- 
rooms on the wharf. 

" At half past two." 

" And it's now five minutes past nine," moaned 
the merrymakers. 

" Why, I'll tell you what you can do," said the 
agent ; " you can go to Hingham by the Old Colony 
cars, and so come back by the Hull and Hingham 
boat." 

" That's it ! " chorused his listeners, " we'll go ; " 
and " Now," said their spokesman to the driver, 
" I dare say you didn't know that Liverpool Wharf 
was so near ; but I don't think you've earned your 



 

money, and you ought to take us on to the Old 
Colony Depot for half-fares at the most." 

The driver looked pained, as if some small tatters 
and shreds of conscience were flapping uncomfortably 
about his otherwise dismantled spirit. Then he 
seemed to think of his wife and family, for he put 
on the air of a man who had already made great 
sacrifices, and " I couldn't, really, I couldn't afford 
it," said he ; and as the victims turned from him in 
disgust, he chirruped to his horses and drove off. 

" Well," said the pleasurers, " we won't give it 
up. We will have our day's pleasure after all. 
But what can we do to kill five hours and a half? 
It's miles away from everything, and, besides, there's 
nothing even if we were there." At this image of 
their remoteness and the inherent desolation of Bos- 
ton they could not suppress some sighs, and in the 
mean time Aunt Melissa stepped into the waiting- 
room, which opened on the farther side upon the 
water, and sat contentedly down on one of the 
benches ; the rest, from sheer vacuity and irresolu- 
tion, followed, and thus, without debate, it was. 
settled that they should wait there till the boat left. 
The agent, who was a kind man, did what he could 
to alleviate the situation : he gave them each the 
advertisement of his line of boats, neatly printed 
upon a card, and then he went away. 

All this prospect of waiting would do well enough 
for the ladies of the party, but there is an impatience 
in the masculine fibre which does not brook the no- 
tion of such prolonged repose ; and the leader of the 



excursion presently pretended an important errand 
up town, — nothing less, in fact, than to buy a 
tumbler out of which to drink their claret on the 
beach. A holiday is never like any other day to the 
man who takes it, and a festive halo seemed to en- 
wrap the excursionist as he pushed on through the 
busy streets in the cool shadow of the vast granite 
palaces wherein the genius of business loves to house 
itself in this money-making land, and inhaled the 
odors of great heaps of leather and spices and dry 
goods as he passed the open doorways, — odors that 
mixed pleasantly with the smell of the freshly 
watered streets. When he stepped into a crockery 
store to make his purchase a sense of pleasure-taking 
did not fail him, and he fell naturally into talk with 
the clerk about the weather and such pastoral topics. 
Even when he reached the establishment where his 
own business days were passed some glamour seemed 
to be cast upon familiar objects. To the disen- 
chanted eye all things were as they were on all 
other dullish days of summer, even to the accus- 
tomed bore leaning up against his favorite desk and 
transfixing his habitual victim with his usual theme. 
Yet to the gaze of this pleasure-taker all was subtly 
changed, and he shook hands right and left as he 
entered, to the marked surprise of the objects of his 
effiision. He had merely come to get some news- 
papers to help pass away the long moments on the 
wharf, and when he had found these, he hurried 
back thither to hear what had happened during his 
absence. 



 

It seemed that there had hardly ever been such 
an eventful period in the lives of the family before, 
and he listened to a minute account of it from Cousin 
Lucy. " You know, Frank," says she, " that Sallie's 
one idea in life is to keep the baby from getting the 
whooping-cough, and I declare that these premises 
have done nothing but reecho with the most dolo- 
rous whoops ever since you've been gone, so that at 
times, in my fear that Sallie would think I'd been 
careless about the boy, I've been ready to throw 
myself into the water, and nothing 's prevented me 
but the doubt whether it wouldn't be better to 
throw in the whoopers instead." 

At this moment a pale little girl, with a face wan 
and sad through all its dirt, came and stood in the 
doorway nearest the baby, and in another instant 
she had burst into a whoop so terrific that, if she had 
meant to have his scalp next it could not have been 
more dreadful. Then she subsided into a deep and 
pathetic quiet, with that air peculiar to the victims 
of her disorder of having done nothing noticeable. 
But her outburst had set at work the mysterious 
machinery of half a dozen other whooping-coughers 
lurking about the building, and all unseen they 
wound themselves up with appalling rapidity, and in 
the utter silence which followed left one to think 
they had died at the climax. 

" Why, it's a perfect whooping-cough factory, 
this place," cries Cousin Lucy in a desperation. 
" Go away, do, please, from the baby, you poor little 
dreadftd object you," she continues, turning upon 




the only visible operative in the establishment. 
"Here, take this ; " and she bribes her with a bit of 
sponge-cake, on which the child runs lightly off along 
the edge of the wharf. " That's been another of 
their projects for driving me wild," says Cousin 
Lucy, — " trying to take their own lives in a hun- 
dred ways before my face and eyes. Why will their 
mothers let them come here to play? " 

Really,' they were very melancholy little figures, 
and might have gone near to make one sad, even if 
they had not been constantly imperilling their lives. 
Thanks to its being summer-time, it did not much 
matter about the scantiness of their clothing, but 
their squalor was depressing, it seemed, even to 
themselves, for they were a moumfid-looking set of 
children, and in their dangerous sports trifled silently 
and almost gloomily with death. There were none 
of them above eight or nine years of age, and most 
of them had the care of smaller brothers, or even 
babes in arms, whom they were thus early inuring 
to the perils of the situation. The boys were dressed 
in pantaloons and shirts which no excess of rolling 
up in the legs and arms could make small enough, 
and the incorrigible too-bigness of which rendered 
the favorite amusements still more hazardous from 
their liability to trip and entangle the wearers. The 
little girls had on each a sohtary garment, which 
hung about her gaunt person with antique severity 
of outline ; while the babies were multitudinously 
swathed in whatever fragments of dress could be 
tied or pinned or plastered on. Their faces were 



strikingly and almost ingeniously dirty, and their 
distractions among the coal-heaps and cord-wood 
constantly added to the variety and advantage of 
these effects. 

"Whvdo their mothers let them come here?" 
muses Frank aloud. " Why, because it's so safe, 
Cousin Lucy. At home, you know, they'd have to 
be playing upon the sills of fourth-floor windows, and 
here they're out of the way and can't hurt them- 
selves. Why, Cousin Lucy, this is their park, — 
their Public Garden, their Bois de Boulogne, their 
Cascine. And look at their gloomy httle faces ! 
Aren't they taking their pleasure in the spirit of the 
very highest fashion ? I was at Newport last sum- 
mer, and saw the famous driving on the Avenue in 
those pony phaetons, dog-carts, and tubs, and three- 
story carriages with a pair of footmen perching like 
storks upon each gable, and I assure you that all 
those ornate and costly phantasms (it seems to me 
now like a sad, sweet vision) had just the expression 
of these poor children. We're taking a day's pleas- 
ure ourselves, cousin, but nobody would know it from 
our looks. And has nothing but whooping-cough 
happened since I've been gone ? " 

" Yes, we seem to be so cut ofiF from every-day 
associations that I've imagined myself a sort of tour- 
ist, and I've been to that Catholic church over yon- 
der, in hopes of seeing the Murillos and Raphaels ; 
but I found it locked up, and so I trudged back with- 
out a sight of the masterpieces. But what's the rea- 
son that all the shops hereabouts have nothing but
