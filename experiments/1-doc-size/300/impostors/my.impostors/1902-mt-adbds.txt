Now I would like to ask this young 
man aquSlibrr orirwrT'*' 

Some of the boys winced, and Fer- 
guson said, 

" Tm afraid Archy's going to catch 
it now' 

The others lost their smiles and 
sobered down. Mr. Holmes said: 

"Let us proceed to examine into 
this fairy-tale in a consecutive and 
orderly way — by geometrical pro- 
gression, so to speak — linking detail 
to detail in a steadily advancing and 
remorselessly consistent and unassail- 
able march upon this tinsel toy-fortress 
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow 
imagination. To begin with, young 
sir, I desire to ask you but three ques- 
tions at present — at present. Did I 
understand you to say it was your 

The opinion that the supposititious candle 
test was lighted at about eight o'clock 

yesterdaj'' evening?'' 
"Yes, sir — about eight." 
"Could you say exactly eight?" 
"Well, no, I couldn't be that ex- 
act." 

" Um. If a person had been passing 
along there just about that time, he 
would have been almost sure to en- 
counter that assassin, do you think?" 
"Yes, I should think so." 
"Thank you, that is all. For the 
present. I say, all for the present." 


" Dern himl he's laying for Archy," 
said Ferguson. 

"It's so' said Ham Sandwich. 
"I don't like the look of it." 

Stillman said, glancing at the guest, 

''I was along there myself at half 

 On the past eight — no, about nine." spot 

"In-deed? This is interesting — this 
is very interesting. Perhaps you en- 
countered the assassin yourself?" 

"No, I encoimtered no one." 

"Ah. Then — if you will excuse 
the remark — I do not quite see the 
relevancy of the information." 

"It has none. At present. I say 
it has none — at present." He paused. 
Presently he resumed: "I did not en- 
counter the assassin, but I am on his 
track, I am sure, for I believe he is in 
this room. I will ask you all to pass 
one by one in front of me — here, where 
there is a good light — so that I can 
see your feet' 

A buzz of excitement swept the 
place, and the march began, the guest 
looking on with an iron attempt at 
gravity which was not an unqualified 
success. Stillman stooped, shaded 
his eyes with his hand, and gazed 
down intently at each pair of feet as 
it passed. Fifty men tramped monot- 
onously by — with no result. Sixty. 
Seventy. The thing was beginning 
to look absurd. The guest remarked, 
with suave irony, 

"Assassins appeal to be scar ce 
this evening." 

The house saw the humor of it, and 


refreshed itself with a cordial laugh. 
Ten or twelve more candidates tramped 
by — no, danced by, with airy and 
ridiculous capers which convulsed the 
spectators — then suddenl} Stillman 
put out his hand and said, 

" This is the assassin !" 
" Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhe- 
drim!'' roared the crowd; and at once 
let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and 
dazzle and confusion of stirring re- 
marks inspired by the situation. 

At the height of the turmoil the 
guest stretched out his hand, com- 
manding peace. The authority of a 
great name and a great personality 
laid its mysterious compulsion upon 
the house, and it obeyed. Out of the 
panting calm which succeeded, the 
guest spoke, saying, with dignity 
and feeling: 

"This is serious. It strikes at an 
innocent life. Innocent beyond sus- 
picion! Innocent beyond perad vent- 
ure! Hear me prove it; observe how 
simple a fact can brush out of existence 
this witless lie. Listen. My friends, 
that lad was never out of my sight 
yesterday~evenTng at any time \" 

It made a deep impression. Men 
turned their eyes upon Stillman with 
grave inquiry in them. His face 
brightened, and he said, 

"I knew there was another one!" 
He stepped briskly to the table and 
glanced at the guest's feet, then up at 
his face, and said: "You were with 
him! You were not fifty steps from 

him when he lit the candle that by- 
and-by fired the powder .' (Sensor 
tion.) "And what is more, you furnished 
the matches yourself!'' matches 

plainly the guest seemed hit; it 
looked so to the public. He opened 
his mouth to speak; the words did 
not come freely. 

'' This — er — this is insanity — 
this—" 

Stillman pressed his evident ad- 
vantage home. He held up a charred 
match. 

''Here is one of them. I found it 
in the barrel — and there's another one 
there." 

The guest foimd his voice at once. 

"Yes — and put them there your- 
self." 


It was recognized as a good shot 
Stillman retorted: 

''It is wax — a breed unknown to 
this camp. I am ready to be searched 
for the box. Are you?" 

The guest was staggered this time 
— the dullest eye could see it. He 
fumbled with his hands ; once or twice 
his lips moved, but the words did not 
come. The house waited and watched, 
in tense suspense, the stillness adding 
effect to the situation. Presently Still- 
man said, gently, 

"We are waiting for your decision." 

There was silence again during 
several moments; then the guest an- 
swered, in a low voice, 

" I refuse to be searched." 

There was no noisy demonstration
but all about the house one voice 
after another muttered: 
"That settles it He's Archy's Arch's 
meat." 

What to do now? Nobody seemed 
to know. It was an embarrassing 
situation for the moment — merely, of 
course, because matters had taken 
such a sudden and unexpected turn 
that these unpractised minds were 
not prepared for it, and had come to a 
standstill, like a stopped clock, under 
the shock. But after a little the ma- 
chinery began to work again, tenta- 
tively, and by twos and threes the 
men put their heads together and 
privately buzzed over this and that 
and the other proposition. One of 
these propositions met with much fa- 
ingthe '» it was, to conf er upon the assassin 
assassin   q£ thanks for removing Flint 
Buclmer, and let him go. Butthe 
cooler heads opposed it, pointing out 
that addled brains in tHeEastern 
States would pronounce it a scandal, 
and make no end of foolish noise 
about it. In the end the cool heads 
got the upper hand, and obtained 
general consent to a proposition of 
their own, and their leader then called 
the house to order and stated it — to 
this effect: that Fetlock Jones be 
jailed and put upon his trial. 

The motion was carried. Appar- 
ently there was nothing further to do 
now, and the people were glad, for, 
privately, they were impatient to get 
out and rush to the scene of the trag- 
edy, and see whether that barrel and 
the other things were really there or 
not. 

But no— the break-up got a check. 
The surprises were not over yet. For 
a while Fetlock Jones had been silent- 
ly sobbing, unnoticed in the absorb- 
ing excitements which had been fol- 
lowing one another so persistently 
for some time; but when his arrest 
and trial were decreed, he broke out 
despairingly, and said : 

"No! it's no use. I don't want 
any jail, I don't want any trial; I've 
had all the hard luck I want, and all 
the miseries. Hang me now, and let 
me out! It would all come out, any- 
way — there couldn't anjhing save 
me. He bas told it all, just as if he'd 
been with me and seen it — I don't

know how he found out; and you 
find the barrel and things, and then I 
The wouldn't have any chance any more. 

sl' I killed him; and you'd have done 
it too, if he'd treated you like a dog, 
and you only a boy, and weak and 
poor, and not a friend to help you." 

"And served him damned well 
right!" broke in Ham Sandwich. 
"Looky here, boys—" 

From the constable: "Order! Or- 
der, gentlemen!" 

A voice: "Did your uncle know 
what you was up to?" 

"No, he didn't." 

"Did he give you the matches, 
sure enough?" 



"Yes, he did; but he didn't know 
what I wanted them for' 

" When you was out on such a busi- 
ness as that, how did you venture to 
risk having him along — and him a 
detective? How's that?" 

The boy hesitated, fumbled with 
his buttons in an embarrassed way, 
then said, shyly. 


"I know about detectives, on account 
of having them in the family; 
and if you don't want them to find 
out about a thing, it's best to have 
them around when you do it." 

The cyclone of laughter which 
greeted this naive discharge of wis-
