" I went round and saw the doctor, and he sent her 
this," taking up the vial from which he had given the 
medicine. " It has produced a condition of physical in 
sensibility, as he desired. Poor thing ! " 

There was a tone of pity in the voice of Mr. Guy. 

Mrs. Harte went to the bed, and stooping over the 
insensible woman examined her carefully. 

" How much did she take ? " 

" Only three small doses. Her system is not used 
to narcotics, and has yielded quickly." 

After looking at Mrs. Guy for a few moments, Mrs. 
Harte turned and fixed her cold, blue eyes on the face 
of Mr. Guy. He saw inquiry in them. 

" What is to be done ? " There was an invitation 
to confidence in her voice clearly apprehended by Mr. 
Guy. 



 

" Sit down, Mrs. Harte." The offered chair was ac 
cepted. Mr. Guy went back to the chamber door and 
turned the key. Then he drew another chair in front 
of the housekeeper and sat down. She looked calmly 
expectant. 

" May I claim your confidence, Mrs. Harte ? " 

" Yes, sir. I am a discreet woman." 

Guy fixed his eyes intently upon her. She did not 
betray a sign of feeling, nor turn away from his her cold 
gaze for a moment. 

" You have not failed to observe my wife's unhappy 
state of mind ? " 

" It is too apparent, sir, to every one," answered Mrs. 
Harte. 

" Nor, that it is on the increase ? " 

" Unfortunately, its increase is undoubted," said Mrs. 
Harte. 

Mr. Guy now took from his pocket a folded paper. 

" Read that." And he handed it to Mrs. Harte. 

" The Doctor's certificate, I see." 

"Yes." 

" Pronouncing her insane, and in need of treatment 
in some Asylum." 

" Exactly. And you will see, by the date, that I 
have had it in my possession for several months." 

" So I perceive." 

" Forbearing all that time, and hoping all that time 
for a change in her condition, that would render need 
less a last resort." 

Mrs. Harte sighed very naturally, adding to her sigh 
the words " Poor lady ! " and then shook her head in 
a hopeless kind of way. 



 

" This is a fair opportunity to have her removed," 
said Mr. Guy, comprehending the woman's state of ac 
quiescence. " She is entirely unconscious, and will, in 
all probability, remain so for hours. Can I secure your 
cooperation ? " 

" If all is right," answered the woman. 

" You hold the guaranty in your hand, Mrs Harte. 
As to the insanity, your own observation makes that 
clear." 

" That is clear enough, poor lady ! " said Mrs. Harte. 

" And the authority for her removal is explicit." 

" So I perceive." 

Then let us act without hesitation or delay, both for 
her sake and that of her children, over whom her in 
fluence is of a very unhappy character. My purpose is 
to remove her to-night, and have her safely cared for 
before consciousness returns. What do you think of 
it?" 

Mrs. Harte reflected for a few moments, and then re 
plied, 

" I do not see, sir, that a better opportunity is likely 
soon to occur. You are certain that she has not taken 
too much of the morphine ? " 

And Mrs. Harte gave Guy a searching look. 

" Too much ! No ! I kept to the Doctor's prescrip 
tion within a drop." 

" Because," added Mrs. Harte, in her calm, clear 
voice, " I do not wish to get myself into any trouble." 

" There can be no trouble to any one in the case," 
said Mr. Guy. 

The woman's eyes did not fall away from his face, but 



 

dwelt on it for several moments, and with an expression 
that Guy felt as a kind of power over him. He had 
not, since this woman came into the family held with 
her, until now, any familiar or confidential intercourse. 
Wrapped in his own separate thoughts and interests, he 
had moved about his house, only considering Mrs. Harte 
as a useful appendage in her place, and of no more ac 
count to him than any other bit of domestic machinery. 
But, now, the relation had changed, and he felt it 
felt it with an" in ward sense of reluctance and repulsion. 

" If there is entire safety, sir." How even and pene 
trating her voice ! How steadily her cold, searching 
eyes rest upon his face ! 

" You understand the case as well as I do, madam." 
There was an apparent drawing back from the woman, 
on the part of Mr. Guy, which was perceived on the 
instant, and produced a change in her manner. 

" I believe so, sir," her tone was softer and more ac 
quiescent ; " and if I can serve you and the poor lady 
in anything, I stand ready to act. She will be a great 
deal better off in a well-managed Asylum. Where do 
you think of placing her ? " 

" Among the Sisters at Mount Hop^e." 

" Ah ? " 

" Yes. I have already consulted them on the subject, 
and shown the Doctor's certificate. They are pre 
pared, at any time, to receive her." 

" She could not be sent to a better place," said Mrs. 
Harte. 

" I am sure not. And my instructions will be that 
she receive the kindest and most humane attentions. 



 

But, time passes, and we must act promptly, if we act 
at all." 

" True, sir." And Mrs. Harte arose. 

"Have the children all in bed before her removal," 
said Mr. Guy. 

" The three youngest are asleep ; but you will have 
to see after Adam, John, and Lydia. If I were to say 
'go to bed,' they would sit up half the night in rebuke 
of my assumed authority." 

" Very well. I'll settle that. Remain here, and get 
all things ready for her removal. After the boys and 
Lydia are in bed, I will go for a carriage. You must 
be prepared to accompany us. Lock the door when I 
go out, so that no one in the house may intrude and ob 
tain a knowledge of what is going on." 

Mr. Guy then withdrew, and Mrs. Harte turned 
the key. 



CHAPTER XXII. 




D 



HE woman's aspect changed instantly, 
when alone. The cold eyes and face 
flashed and gleamed ; the placid man 
ner became disturbed ; a look of satis 
faction almost of triumph flitted 
over her countenance. Quickly she 
proceeded to the work of changing the 
garments of Mrs. Guy, and getting all 
things in readiness for removal. Now 
and then, she would stop and consider the pale, death 
like face before her, not in pity ; not in fear ; not in 
hate ; but with a look of searching inquiry, in which 
doubt and desire blended. There was a covert eager 
ness in her manner, seen in the unusual celerity with 
which she hovered about the bed, and the occasional un 
steadiness of her hands as they moved over the person 
of Mrs. Guy. Her part of the work was done, long 
before Guy was ready, or the carriage at the door. 

" Has she stirred yet? " was the whispered question 
of Mr. Guy, as he came into the chamber, when all 
was prepared. 
" No, sir." 

Guy crossed to the bed, where his wife lay, and stood 
regarding her for a few moments. An image of death, 



 

not life, was before him. His heart gave a strong throb, 
and he turned a face of alarm upon Mrs. Harte. They 
looked at each other in silence for some moments. 

" Her heart beats," replied the woman, who under 
stood him. 

Guy took his wife's small, wasted hand in his, and 
placed his fingers on the wrist. 

" I don't find any pulse," said he, turning pale. His 
voice was disturbed. 

" Lay your hand over her heart." 

Guy obeyed the suggestion. 

" Don't you feel it beat ? " 

"No!" 

"What!" And Mrs. Harte thrust her hand in, 
pushing that of Mr. Guy aside. Suspended breaths 
marked the intense interest of both. " It beats, sir ! 
There ! Put your hand there ! " She spoke in a whisper, 
quickly. 

" Yes yes. I feel it ! But how very low and 
faint," said Guy, as he withdrew his hand and stood 
up, in doubt and irresolution. Then he laid his fingers 
again over the artery on her wrist. Not the feeblest 
thread of motion touched the alert sense of feeling:. 

O 

" You gave her too much, I fear," said Mrs. Harte, 
letting her pale, blue eyes rest firmly upon him. 

The face of Mr. Guy turned still whiter. 

" In that case " and the woman made a step back 
wards, pausing with the sentence half finished. 

" How in that case ? " Guy felt himself already in 
her power. 

'' She may not rally," said the woman. 



 

" The Doctor is responsible. I only followed his pre 
scription." 

" How often did she take the medicine ? " 

" Three times." 

" How much did you give her each time ? " 

" Only a few drops."
