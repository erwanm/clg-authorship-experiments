" All this time I had been fighting with myself. Bruce 
and I corresponded frequently, and, without knowing the 
story at all, he seemed to understand that something was 
wrong, and his letters were so brave and comforting. I 
could see the right through his eyes, and all my own weak- 
ness and foily . I do believe if he had been at Cedarwood 
I must have told him. You know it would not have been 
as keen a sorrow to him as to you ; it would not have 
touched him so nearly. 

" Uncle Robert, I wonder if I was weak in so giving up 
my whole heart to the pleasure of home ? I really had not 
made up my mind to anything until that first night ; then I 
resolved to shut out my own misery, to be as happy, to 
make you all as happy as I could. And in a few days a 
curious knowledge or revelation came to me." And Rob 
turned his face a little, while he tried to steady his voice. 
" I may have misunderstood, but it seemed as if mother, 
Kathie, and every one had a secret feeling that that 
Fay Collamore might be brought in our midst, and would 
be warmly, fondly welcomed. Suddenly, as if in a blazing 
light, I saw what it might have been to me." 

Rob sprang up and began to pace the floor. Oh, what 
words could comfort ! Mr. Conover rose, too, came and 
put his arm over the other's shoulder, but was silent. 

" I knew then that I had admired Fay Collamore from 
the very first, that I had been pleased when Kathie wrote 
about her, that if all things were fair and right, I could 
bring such a complete happiness in the family ; I could 
be happy myself. Here was a girl worth loving and hon- 





oring, and I had promised my soul and body to the other. 
While she lived I had no right to put her away except for 
some great and awful crime. And if I did put her away 
on any weak, flimsy pretext, a girl like Fay Collamore, 
with so high and fine a sense of justice, would not marry 
me, ought not. And so the training of my whole life, that 
oftentimes seemed thrown away, I dare say ; the compan- 
ionship of such men as you, and Mr. Meredith, and Mr. 
Langdon, of such boyS as Charlie, and Bruce, and Dick, 
and women like mother and Aunt Ruth, joined to save me. 
I had gone into this thing by my own mad folly, and I 
must bear it myself, not thrust it on other people's shoul- 
ders, not cry out for the joys I had missed by my own 
heedlessness. And I vowed, with God's help, that hence- 
forward I would be to you all it was possible for son, or 
brother, or friend, and keep my own soul clear of any new 
stains. I could not help being thrown with Fay, but I did 
try utterly to give no look or word, to hold no thought de- 
rogatory to her. Mother's delicate little plans were hard 
to traverse, and I fancy Fay wondered at times. Yet dif- 
ficult and painful as the path was, I hated so to leave you, to 
come back to my own wretched life. I would not mar 
your delightful hours with such gray shadows." 

" But you might have told me," the elder cried, with a 
touch of upbraiding in his tone. 

" No, I could n't. My strength was in keeping still. 
Sympathy, tenderness would have finished me. We should 
have betrayed our secret." 

" But now?" Mr. Conover asked in a tone of something 
like relief. " Have you come to the end ? " 

Rob made a passionate gesture, as if he could crush 
something out of sight. " If it could be the end," he 
cried. " If you can decide " 

" Go on, then." 

" I came back to Chicago, and she joined me a month 
later. We had a new boarding place of her choosing, 




among the kind of people she liked. They were polite 
enough to me, but I fancy they considered me a young 
fool, and they were right enough," bitterly. ' ; I did try to 
awaken some desire of better things in her, and remon- 
strated, as I l;ad times before, about her drinking, but it 
always ended in painful disputes. There was absolutely 
nothing I could do. She still kept her voice, but she used 
it to charm her favorites, with her other blandishments. 
J was not jealous ; it is strange, but I never had been 
jealous of her from the first. I had to be away evenings 
with extra work, for the money was a necessity, but when 
I remained at home she was as likely to go out. And so 
we went on our way, the bond growing harder and harder 
to bear. I think she was really sorry she had married me ; 
she did say now and then she was a fool for having done 
it. Oh, why did she ? There was nothing in a home to 
satisfy her, and she might have taken some one older, 
richer, more like herself. 

" I went home two weeks ago and found a note on the 
bureau directed to myself. Come to the light and read it, 
and you will hardly say that I have been bitter or unjust 
in this terrible story." 

Mr. Conover took the crumpled missive and spread it 
out. It was poorly written and misspelled, and betrayed a 
sort of scornful animosity in every line. She had been al- 
together disappointed in the marriage, and she could en- 
dure it no longer ; she had been a fool for ever trying to 
live with him. She had gone with some one who cared for 
her beyond a boy's silly regard ; she would have all she 
wanted, and he need make no search for her or trouble 
himself in any way about her. She had never cared for 
the child or wanted it ; so he might take the child, and get 
a divorce as soon as he pleased ; it could not be too soon 
for her. 

" There is no question, then, about freedom " 

The young face was turned to him with a strained, des- 





perate longing, and yet a peculiar awe. His voice was 
hoarse with emotion as he cried : 

"That is not all. There was a terrible accident right 
in the beginning of their journey. He escaped unharmed. 
She was terribly injured about the head, and taken to a 
hospital. After a few days the doctors decided she might 
recover, but that she would never have her senses again. 
Then the word was sent to me. The lover, you see, could 
not take her at so great a sacrifice. O Uncle Robert, 
isn't it horribly hard ! What can I do ? " 

He flung himself on the sofa and buried his face on the 
cushioned arm, while hard, dry sobs shook his frame. His 
uncle paced the floor in great distress. All this young life 
that should have been so bright, and glad, and promising, 
marred and blighted by one fatal deed. 

He sprang up suddenly, his eyes fierce with despairing 
passion, his voice clinging to a last ray of hope. 

" Ought I to keep to her, Uncle Robert? She went 
away for her own pleasure. She did not even care for her 
own little child. She has broken. God 's law, man's law, 
and a horrible, swift punishment has overtaken her. Is 
there any justice in making me suffer for it, years, per- 
haps?" 

" O my boy, we cannot decide this in a moment ! You 
are worn out with excitement, and must have a little rest ; 
and I must think it over. Can I see her some time ? " 

" Yes. She has been sent here. She is in the hospital. 
Every care and attention will be paid her." 

" Then we will not settle that point to-night. Sit down 
here and rest." 



CHAPTER XVII. 

IN spite of Robert Alston's splendid physique and buoy- 
ant temperament, his night's vigil and the anxiety of the 
past week had begun to tell upon him. He looked worn 
and haggard ; his lips seemed compressed to a thin, bluish 
line. His uncle had tried to make him sleep some through 
the night, but the greater part of it had been spent in 
restlessly pacing the floor, even if he refrained from 
impatient questioning. He had asked for leave of absence 
from the counting-house, so he could have the day to 
devote to his uncle and the sadder errands. 

There were many little things that had not been related 
in the hurried story of the evening before. The young 
man did not spare himself, and yet it seemed as if the 
foolish girl had made fully as great a sacrifice, unless she 
had counted on the possible wealth of the youth. It was 
quite evident she had taken no special interest in any of 
his pursuits, neither had it been from any ardent regard 
for him. 

They went together to see her. There was one cut at 
the edge of her hair, and the discolor from bruises had not 
quite disappeared. Seen there, in that strange life-in- 
death state, the face had come back to a curious, youtliful 
beauty, the beauty put in marble when a soul is not needed. 
The skin was fine and soft, full of sinuous blue pencillings, 
the rounded chin had a deep dimple, the full, curved lips 
were closed even now with a coquettish half smile, and the 
long bronze lashes shadowed the pale cheeks. Once, she 
opened her eyes. They were of that infantile, purple blue, 





and Mr. Conover, well versed in the ways and wiles of 
womankind, could readily understand how dangerous their 
snares might be for unwary youth. Yet it had seemed as 
if that would be the least of all temptations to Robert 
Alston. 

They saw one of the physicians presently. It was merely 
an iteration of the verdict. There was no reason why she 
should not live ; her physical injuries had not been severe, 
but the brain had suffered beyond any repair. 

" She will be harmless," he said in a gentle tone ; 
''never violent, and probably sink into mild idiocy. Of 
course she will need continual care. I think I should 
advise an asylum, unless she has friends, such as mother 
or sister. Even then it is a tiresome charge to one unused 
to such cases." 

' ' Do you know anything about her mother ? " Uncle 
Robert asked afterward. 

Rob gave a shiver of disgust. "No," he answered; 
''they quarrelled bitterly the last time she was here, and 
they are not people one would care to hunt up, even if we 
could." 

" Of course," the elder said gravely, " there is only one 
thing to do at present. When she is discharged from here 
she must be placed somewhere in safety, and provision 
made for her. An asylum will be the best." 

If she had died ! They could not but think of that sim- 
ple ending to the tragedy, and yet God had not chosen 
so to make it. And how to take the next important step 
rightly and truly for this young soul was a matter of 
grave consideration to Robert Conover. 

As the)' emerged from the hospital he said to his nephew, 
" Rob, will you take me to see the child? " 

The young man flushed vividly, but assented Uncle 
Robert made no comment, but presently his nephew broke 
the silence. 

" I suppose you will think me heartless," in a kind of 




justifying tone, u only you can't see all at once, Uncle 
Robert, and understand how pressed I was on every side. 
She did not want the child at home, and it was very trou- 
blesome at night. Then I needed my strength and ener- 
gies for business. It was much cheaper to put it out, a 
consideration I could not afford to despise, and it seemed 
to me much better. I do suppose it weakened the tie ; I 
never can make it my child. I feel as if I had no busi- 
ness with a child." 

'' And you surety have not, Robert, at your age. It is 
a sad commentary on early marriages. I never imagined 
you could be beguiled into such a step, and so this was one 
of the points never discussed. There is too slight a 
responsibility attached to it nowadays. I am not sure 
but among our other studies we ought to educate young 
men for marriage, train them to the gravity, the sacred- 
ness of the step, the awful solemnity of the vow, ' for 
better, for worse.' " 

'' How could I have done it ? I ask myself the question 
over and over again. I had been drinking a little wine 
that night, but that didn't take away my senses. And I 
didn't care for marriage, either ; I had not been thinking 
of it " 

" Just what I said. If it had been held as a solemn 
sacrament, more important than joining a church even, or 
any secular step in life, you could not have done it. 
Didn't you say last night you were warned." 

" Yes, two or three of the fellows talked about them in 
a rather sneering manner, which always made me feel as 
if I wanted to get up and fight. And yet they were 
received in society, in some society, for Addie's music 
made her a great favorite. And no one quite knew until 
the sister went to Europe ; then a great deal of gossip came 
out about them. But it was too late for me." 

Uncle Robert understood more clearly than his nephew 
how it had happened ; how a few moments of inconsiderate
