mental concentration to the utmost. It never ap 
peared twice in the same place, and when at last 
Sewell had tutored the sexton carefully in Lemuel 's 
dress, he was driven to despair one morning- when 
he saw the boy sliding along between the seats in 
the gallery, and sitting down with an air of satis 
faction in an entirely new suit of clothes. 

After this defeat the sexton said with humorous 
sympathy, " Well, there ain't anything for it now, 
Mr. Sewell, but a detective, or else an advertisement 
in the Personals." 

Sewell laughed with him at his joke, and took 
what comfort he could from the evidence of prosper 
ity which Lemuel 's new clothes offered. He argued 
that if Barker could afford to buy them he could not 
be in immediate need, and for some final encounter 
with him he trusted in Providence, and was not too 
much cast down when his wife made him recognise 
that he was trusting in Luck. It was an ordeal to 
look forward to finding Lemuel sooner or later 
among his hearers every Sunday; but having pre 
pared his nerves for the shock, as men adjust their 
sensibilities to the recurrent pain of a disease, he 
came to bear it with fortitude, especially as he 
continually reminded himself that he had his fixed 
purpose to get at Lemuel at last and befriend him in 
any and every possible way. He tried hard to keep 
from getting a grudge against him. 

At the hotel, Lemuel remained in much of his 
original belief in the fashion and social grandeur of 



 

the ladies who formed the majority of Mrs. Harmon 's 
guests. Our womankind are prone to a sort of 
helpless intimacy with those who serve them ; the 
ladies had an instinctive perception of Lemuel 's 
trustiness, and readily gave him their confidence 
and much of their history. He came to know 
them without being at all able to classify them 
with reference to society at large, as of that 
large tribe among us who have revolted from 
domestic care, and have skilfully unseated the black 
rider who remains mounted behind the husband of 
the average lady-boarder. Some of them had never 
kept house, being young and newly married, though 
of this sort there were those who had tried it in flats, 
and had reverted to their natural condition of 
boarding. They advised Lemuel not to take a flat, 
whatever he did, unless he wanted to perish at once. 
Other lady boarders had broken up housekeeping 
during the first years of the war, and had been 
boarding round ever since, going from hotels in the 
city to hotels in the country, and back again with 
the change of the seasons ; these mostly had hus 
bands who had horses, and they talked with equal 
tenderness of the husbands and the horses, so that 
you could not always tell which Jim or Bob was ; 
usually they had no children, but occasionally they 
had a married daughter, or a son who lived West. 
There were several single ladies : one w r ho seemed 
to have nothing in this world to do but to come down 
to her meals, and another a physician who had not 
been able, in embracing the medical profession, to 



 

deny herself the girlish pleasure of her pet name, 
and was lettered in the list of guests in the entry as 
Dr. Cissie Bluff. In the attic, which had a north- 
light favourable to their work, were two girls, who 
were studying art at the Museum; one of them 
looked delicate at first sight, and afterwards seemed 
merely very gentle, with a clear-eyed pallor which 
was not unhealth. A student in the Law School sat 
at the table with these girls, and seemed sometimes 
to go with them to concerts and lectures. From his 
talk, which was almost the only talk that made itself 
heard in the dining-room, it appeared that he was 
from Wyoming Territory ; he treated the young 
ladies as representative of Boston and its prejudices, 
though apparently they were not Bostonians. There 
were several serious and retiring couples, of whom one 
or otherwas an invalid, and several who were poor, and 
preferred the plated gentility of Mrs. Harmon 's hotel 
it was called the St. Albans ; Mrs. Harmon liked the 
name to the genuine poverty of such housekeeping 
as they could have set up. About each of these 
women a home might have clung, with all its loves 
and cares ; they were naturally like other women ; 
but here they were ignoble particles, without 
attraction for one another, or apparently joy for 
themselves, impermanent, idle, listless j they had got 
rid of the trouble of housekeeping, and of its dignity 
and usefulness. There were a few children in the 
house, not at all noisy ; the boys played on the side 
walk, and the little girls stayed in their rooms with 
their mothers, and rarely took the air oftenerthan they. 



 

They came down rather later to breakfast, and 
they seemed not to go to school ; some of them had 
piano lessons in their rooms. Their mothers did not 
go out much ; sometimes they went to church or the 
theatre, and they went shopping. But they had 
apparently no more social than domestic life. Now 
and then they had a friend to lunch or dinner ; if a 
lady was absent, it was known to Mrs. Harmon, 
and through her to the other ladies, that she was 
spending the day with a friend of hers at an hotel 
in Newton, or Lexington, or Woburn. In a city full 
of receptions, of dinner-giving, and party-going, 
Mrs. Harmon 's guests led the lives of cloistered 
nuns, so far as such pleasures were concerned; 
occasionally a transient had rooms for a week or two, 
and was continually going, and receiving visits. She 
became the object of a certain unenvious curiosity 
with the other ladies, who had not much sociability 
among themselves ; they waited a good while before 
paying visits at one another 's rooms, and then were 
very punctilious not to go again until their calls had 
been returned. They were all doctoring themselves; 
they did not talk gossip or scandal much ; they talked 
of their diseases and physicians, and their married 
daughters and of Mrs. Harmon, whom they censured 
for being too easygoing. Certain of them devoured 
novels, which they carried about clasped to their 
breasts with their fingers in them at the place where 
they were reading ; they did not often speak of them, 
and apparently took them as people take opium. 
The men were the husbands or fathers of the 



 

women, and were wholly without the domestic 
weight or consequence that belongs to men living in 
their own houses. There were certain old bachelors, 
among whom were two or three decayed branches of 
good Boston families, spendthrifts, or invalided 
bankrupts. Mr. Evans was practically among the 
single gentlemen, for his wife never appeared in the 
parlour or dining-room, and was seen only when she 
went in or out, heavily veiled, for a walk. Lemuel 
heard very soon that she had suffered a shock from 
the death of her son on the cars ; the other ladies 
made much of her inability to get over it, and said 
nothing would induce them to have a son of theirs 
go in and out on the cars. 

Among these people, such as they were, and far as 
they might be from a final civilisation, Lemuel began 
to feel an ambition to move more lightly and quickly 
than he had yet known how to do, to speak promptly, 
and to appear well. Our schooling does not train us 
to graceful or even correct speech ; even our colleges 
often leave that uncouth. Many of Mrs. Harmon 's 
boarders spoke bad grammar through their noses ; 
but the ladies dressed stylishly, and the men were 
good arithmeticians. Lemuel obeyed a native 
impulse rather than a good example in cultivating a 
better address; but the incentive to thrift and fashion 
was all about him. He had not been ignorant that 
his clothes were queer in cut and out of date, and 
during his stay at Miss Vane 's he had taken much 
council with himself as to whether he ought not to 
get a new suit with his first money instead of send- 



 

ing it home. ]N T ow he had solved the question, after 
sending the money home, by the discovery of a place 
on a degenerate street, in a neighbourhood of 
Chinese laundries, with the polite name of Misfit 
Parlours, where they professed to sell the failures 
of the leading tailors of Boston, New York, and 
Chicago. After long study of the window of the 
Parlours, Lemuel ventured within one day, and was 
told, when he said he could not afford the suit he 
fancied, that he might pay for it on the instalment 
plan, which the proprietor explained to him. In the 
mirror he was almost startled at the stylishness of 
his own image. The proprietor of the Parlours com 
plimented him. " You see, you've  got a good figure 
for a suit of clothes what I call a ready-made 
figure. You can go into a clothing store anywheres 
and fit you." 

He took the first instalment of the price, with 
Lemuel 's name and address, and said he would send 
the clothes round ; but in the evening he brought 
them himself, and no doubt verified Lemuel 's state 
ment by this device. It was a Saturday night, and 
the next morning Lemuel rose early to put them on. 
He meant to go to church in them, and in the after 
noon he did not know just what he should do. He 
had hoped that some chance might bring them 
together again, and then he could see from the way 
Miss Dudley and Manda Grier behaved, just what 
they thought. He had many minds about the 
matter himself, and had gone from an extreme of 
self-abhorrence to one of self-vindication, and be- 



 

tween these he had halted at every gradation of 
blame and exculpation. But perhaps what chiefly 
kept him away was the uncertainty of his future ; 
till he could give some shape to that he had no 
courage to face the past. Sometimes he wished 
never to see either of those girls again ; but at other 
times he had a longing to go and explain, to justify 
himself, or to give himself up to justice. 

The new clothes gave him more heart than he had 
yet had, but the most he could bring himself to do 
was to walk towards Pleasant Avenue the next 
Sunday afternoon, which Mrs. Harmon especially 
gave him, and to think about walking up and down 
before the house. It ended in his walking up and 
down the block, first on one side of the street and 
then on the other. He knew the girls window; 
Miss Dudley had shown him it was the middle 
window of the top story when they were looking 
out of it, and he glanced up at it. Then he hurried 
away, but he could not leave the street without stop 
ping at the corner, to cast a last look back at the 
house. There was an apothecary 's at that corner, 
and while he stood wistfully staring and going round 
the corner a little way, and coming back to look at 
the things in the apothecary 's window, he saw Manda 
Grier come swiftly towards him. He wanted to run 
away now, but he could not ; he felt nailed to the 
spot, and he felt the colour go out of his face. She 
pretended not to see him at first ; but with a second 
glance she abandoned the pretence, and at his saying 
faintly, " Good afternoon," she said, with freezing 



 

surprise, " Oh ! Good afternoon, Mr. Barker ! " and 
passed into the apothecary 's. 

He could not go now, since he had spoken, and 
leave all so inconclusive again ; and yet Manda Grier 
had been so repellent, so cutting, in her tone and 
manner, that he did not know how to face her 
another time. When she came out he faltered, " I 
hope there isn't anybody sick at your house, Miss 
Grier." 

" Oh, nobody that you'll care about, Mr. Barker," 
she answered airily, and began to tilt rapidly away, 
with her chin thrust out before her. 

He made a few paces after her, and then stopped ; 
she seemed to stop too, and he caught up with her. 

" I hope," he gasped, "there ain't anything the 
matter with Miss Dudley ? " 

" Oh, nothing t you II care about," said Manda 
Grier, and she added with terrible irony, " You've 
b en round to inquire so much that you hain't allowed 
time for any great change." 

" Has she been sick long ? " faltered Lemuel. " I 
didn't dare to- come ! " he cried out. " I've  been 
wanting to come, but I didn't suppose you would 
speak to me any of you." Now his tongue was 
unlocked, he ran on : "I don't know as it 's any 
excuse there ain't any excuse for such a thing ! I 
know she must perfectly despise me, and that I' m 
not fit for her to look at ; but I'd give anything if I 
could take it all back and be just where I was before. 
You tell her, won't you, how I feel ? "
