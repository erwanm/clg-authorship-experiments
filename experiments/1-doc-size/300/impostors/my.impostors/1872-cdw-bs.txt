there was little that could bear the test. He 
had the sly air of a man who could not be de 
ceived, and he- went about with his mouth in 
a pucker of incredulity. There is nothing so 
placid as rustic conceit. There was something 
very enjoyable about his calm superiority to all 
the treasures of art. 

MANDEVILLE. And the Parson reminds me of 
another American minister, a consul in an Italian 
city, who said he was going up to Rome to have 
a thorough talk with the Pope, and give him a 
piece of his mind. Ministers seem to think that 
is their business. They serve it in such small 
pieces in order to make it go round. 

THE PARSON. Mandeville is an infidel. 





Jet 's have some music ; nothing else will keep 
him in good humor till lunch-time. 
THE MISTRESS. What shall it be ? 
THE PARSON. Give us the largJietto from Beet 
hoven's second symphony. 

The Young Lady puts aside her portfolio. 
Herbert looks at the young lady. The Parson 
composes himself for critical purposes. Mande- 
ville settles himself in a chair and stretches his 
long legs nearly into the fire, remarking that 
music takes the tangles out of him. 

After the piece is finished, 
lunch is announced. It 
is still snowing. 





is difficult to explain the attraction 
which the uncanny and even the hor 
rible have for most minds. I have 
seen a delicate woman half fascinated, but 
wholly disgusted, by one of the most unseemly 
of reptiles, vulgarly known as the " blowing 
viper " of the Alleghanies. She would look at it, 
and turn away with irresistible shuddering and the 
utmost loathing, and yet turn to look at it again 
and again, only to experience the same spasm of 
disgust. In spite of her aversion she must have 
relished the sort of electric mental shock that 
the sight gave her. 

I can no more account for the fascination 
for us of the stories of ghosts and " appear- 



 







ances," and those weird tales in which the dead 
are the chief characters ; nor tell why we 
should fall into converse about them when 
the winter evenings are far spent, the* embers 
are glazing over on the hearth, and the listener 
begins to hear the eerie noises in the house. 
At such times one's dreams become of impor 
tance, and people like to tell them and dwell 
upon them, as if they were a link between the 
known and unknown, and could give us a 
clew to that ghostly region which in certain 
states of the mind we feel to be more real than 
that we see. 

Recently, when we were, so to say, sitting 
around the borders of the supernatural late at 
night, MANDEVILLE related a dream of his which 
he assured us was true in every particular, and 
it interested us so much that we asked him to 
write it out. In doing so he has curtailed it, 
and to my mind shorn it of some of its more 
vivid and picturesque features. He might have 
worked it up with more art, and given it a finish 
which the narration now lacks, but I think 
best to insert it in its simplicity. It seems to 
me that it may properly be called, 

 

A NEW "VISION OF SIN." 

IN the winter of 1850 I was a member of one 
of the leading colleges of this country. I was in 
moderate circumstances pecuniarily, though I was 
perhaps better furnished with less fleeting riches 
than many others. I was an incessant and indis 
criminate reader of books. For the solid sciences 
I had no particular fancy, but with mental modes 
and habits, and especially with the eccentric and 
fantastic in the intellectual and spiritual opera 
tions, I was tolerably familiar. All the literature 
of the supernatural was as real to me as the lab 
oratory of the chemist, where I saw the continual 
struggle of material substances to evolve them 
selves into more volatile, less palpable and coarse 
forms. My imagination, naturally vivid, stimu 
lated by such repasts, nearly mastered me. At 
times I could scarcely tell where the material 
ceased and the immaterial began (if I may so 
express it) ; so that once and again I walked, as 
it seemed, from the solid earth onward upon an 
impalpable plain, where I heard the same voices, 
I think, that Joan of Arc heard call to her in the 



garden at Domremy. She was inspired, how 
ever, while I only lacked exercise. I do not 
mean this in any literal sense ; I only describe a 
state of mind. I was at this time of spare habit, 
and nervous, excitable temperament. I was am 
bitious, proud, and extremely sensitive. I cannot 
deny that I had seen something of the world, and 
had contracted about the average bad habits of 
young men who have the sole care of themselves, 
and rather bungle the matter. It is necessary to 
this relation to admit that I had seen a trifle 
more of what is called life than a young man 
ought to see, but at this period I was not only 
sick of my experience, but my habits were as cor 
rect as those of any Pharisee in our college, and 
we had some very favorable specimens of that 
ancient sect. 

Nor can I deny that at this period of my life I 
was in a peculiar mental condition. I well remember an illustration of it. I sat writing late 
one night, copying a prize essay, a merely man 
ual task, leaving my thoughts free. It was in 
June, a sultry night, and about midnight a wind 
arose, pouring in through the open windows, full 



 

of mournful reminiscence, not of this, but of 
other summers, the same wind that De Quincey 
heard at noonday in midsummer blowing through 
the room where he stood, a mere boy, by the side 
of his dead sister, a wind centuries old. As I 
wrote on mechanically I became conscious of a 
presence in the room, though I did not lift my 
eyes from the paper on which I wrote. Gradually 
I came to know that my grandmother dead so 
long ago that I laughed at the idea was in the 
room. She stood beside her old-fashioned spin 
ning-wheel, and quite near me. She wore a plain 
muslin cap with a high puff in the crown, a short 
woollen gown, a white and blue checked apron, 
and shoes with heels. She did not regard me, 
but stood facing the wheel, with the left hand 
near the spindle, holding lightly between the 
thumb and forefinger the white roll of wool 
which was being spun and twisted on it. In her 
right hand she held a small stick. I heard the 
sharp click of this against the spokes of the 
wheel, then the hum of the wheel, the buzz of 
the spindles as the twisting yarn was teased by 
the whirl of its point, then a step backwards, a 



 

pause, a step forward and the running of the 
yarn upon the spindle, and again a backward 
step, the drawing out of the roll and the droning 
and hum of the wheel, most mournful, hopeless 
sound that ever fell on mortal ear. Since child 
hood it has haunted me. All this time I wrote, 
and I could hear distinctly the scratching of the 
pen upon the paper. But she stood behind me 
(why I did not turn my head I never knew), 
pacing backward and forward by the spinning- 
wheel, just as I had a hundred times seen her in 
childhood in the old kitchen on drowsy summer 
afternoons. And I heard the step, the buzz and 
whirl of the spindle, and the monotonous and 
dreary hum of the mournful wheel. Whether her 
face was ashy pale and looked as if it might 
crumble at the touch, and the border of her 
white cap trembled in the June wind that blew, 
I cannot say, for I tell you I did NOT see her. 
But I know she was there, spinning yarn that 
had been knit into hose years and years ago by 
our fireside. For I was in full possession of my 
faculties, and never copied more neatly and legi 
bly any manuscript than I did the one that night. 



 

And there the phantom (I use the word out of 
deference to a public prejudice on this subject) 
most persistently remained until my task was 
finished, and, closing the portfolio, I abruptly 
rose. Did I see anything ? That is a silly and 
ignorant question. Could I see the wind which 
had now risen stronger, and drove a few cloud- 
scuds across the sky, filling the night, somehow, 
with a longing that was not altogether born of 
reminiscence ? 

In the winter following, in January, I made an 
effort to give up the use of tobacco, a habit 
in which I was confirmed, and of which I have 
nothing more to say than this : that I should 
attribute to it almost all the sin and misery in 
the world, did I not remember that the old 
Romans attained a very considerable state of 
corruption without the assistance of the Virginia 
plant. 

On the night of the third day of my absti 
nence, rendered more nervous and excitable than 
usual by the privation, I retired late, and later 
still I fell into an uneasy sleep, and, thus into a 
dream, vivid, illuminated, more real than any 



 

event of my life. I was at home, and fell sick. 
The illness developed into a fever, and then a 
delirium set in, not an intellectual blank, but a 
misty and most delicious wandering in places 
of incomparable beauty. I learned subsequently 
that our regular physician was not certain to 
finish me, when a consultation was called, which 
did the business. I have the satisfaction of 
knowing that they were of the proper school. 
I lay sick for three days. 

On the morning of the fourth, at sunrise, I 
died. 

The sensation was not unpleasant. It was not 
a sudden shock. I passed out of my body as one 
would walk from the door of his house. There 
the body lay, a blank, so far as I was con 
cerned, and only interesting to me as I was 
rather entertained with watching the respect 
paid to it. My friends stood about the bedside, 
regarding me (as they seemed to suppose), while 
I, in a different part of the room, could hardly 
repress a smile at their mistake, solemnized as 
they were, and I too, for that matter, by my 
recent demise. A sensation (the word you see 



 

is material and inappropriate) of etherealization 
and imponderability pervaded me, and I was not 
sorry to get rid of such a dull, slow mass as I 
now perceived myself to be, lying there on the 
bed. When I speak of my death, let me be 
understood to say that there was no change, ex 
cept that I passed out of my body and floated to 
the top of a bookcase in the corner of the room, 
from which I looked down. For a moment I 
was interested to see my person from the out 
side, but thereafter I was quite ' indifferent to 
the body. I was now simply soul. I seemed 
to be a globe, impalpable, transparent, about six 
inches in diameter. I saw and heard everything 
as before. Of course, matter was no obstacle to 
me, and I went easily and quickly wherever I 
willed to go. There was none of that tedious 
process of communicating my wishes to the 
nerves, and from them to the muscles. I sim 
ply resolved to be at a particular place, and 
I was there. It was better than the tele 
graph. 

It seemed to have been intimated to me at 
my death (birth I half incline to call it) that I
