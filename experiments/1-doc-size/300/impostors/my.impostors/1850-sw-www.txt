remembered that sweet moment last night when she lay in 
her mother's arms, after she had stopped singing, could 
it be only last night ? it seemed a long, long time ago. She 
went over again in imagination her shocked waking up that 
very morning, — how cruel that was! — her hurried dressing, — the miserable parting, — and those last words of her 
mother, that seemed to ring in her ears yet. " That home 
where parting cann'ot be." "Oh," thought Ellen, "how 
shall I ever get there ? who is there to teach me now ? O, 
what shall I do without you ? 0, mamma ! how much I 
want you already !" 

While poor Ellen was thinking these things over and over, 
her little face had a deep sadness of expression it was sorrowful to see. She was perfectly calm ; her violent excite- 
ment had all left her; her lip quivered a very little sometimes, but that was all ; and one or two tears rolled slowly 
down the side of her face. Her eyes were fixed upon the 
dancing water, but it was very plain her thoughts were not, 
nor on anything else before her ; and there was a forlorn 
look of hopeless sorrow on her lip and cheek and brow, enough 
to move anybody whose heart was not very hard. She was 
noticed, and with a feeling of compassion, by several people : 
but they all thought it was none of their business to speak 
to her, or they didn't know how. At length, a gentleman 
who had been for some time walking up and down the deck, 
happened to look, as he passed, at her little pale face. He 
went to the end of his walk that time, but in coming back he 
stopped just in front of her, and bending down his face 
towards hers, said, " What is the matter with you, my little 
friend ?" 





Though his figure had passed before her a great many 
times Ellen had not seen him at all ; for "her eyes were with 
her heart, and that was far away." Her cheek flushed with 
surprise as she looked up. But there was no mistaking the 
look of kindness in the eyes that met hers, nor the gentleness and grave truthfulness of the whole countenance. It 
won her confidence immediately. All the floodgates of 
Ellen's heart were at once opened. She could not speak, 
but rising and clasping the hand that was held out to her in 
both her own, she bent down her head upon it, and burst into one of those uncontrollable agonies of weeping, such as the news of her mother's intended departure had occasioned that 
first sorrowful evening. He gently, and as soon as he could, 
drew her to a retired part of the deck where they were comparatively free from other people's eyes and ears ; then 
taking her in his arms he endeavored by many kind and 
soothing words to stay the torrent of her grief. This fit of 
weeping did Ellen more good than the former one ; that only 
exhausted, this in some little measure relieved her. 

" What is all this about ?" said her friend kindly. " Nay. 
never mind shedding any more tears about it, my child. 
Let me hear what it is ; and perhaps we can find some help 
for it." 

" Oh no you can't, sir," said Ellen sadly. 

" Well, let us see," said he, — " perhaps I can. What is it 
that has troubled you so much ?" 

" I have lost my mother, sir," said Ellen. 

" Your mother ! Lost her ! —how ?" 

" She is very ill, sir, and obliged to go away over the sea 
to France to get well; and papa could not take me with her," 
said poor Ellen, weeping again, " and I am obliged to go 
to be among strangers. O what shall I do !" 

" Have you left your mother in the city ?" 
Oh yes, sir ! I left her this morning." 

" What is your name ?" 

" Ellen Montgomery." 

" Is your mother obliged to go to Europe for her health ?" 

" Oh yes, sir ; nothing else would have made her go, but 
the doctor said she would not live long if she didn't go, and 
that would cure her." 







" Then you hope to see her come back by-and-by, don't 

you?" 

" Oh yes, sir ; but it won't be this great, great, long while ; 
it seems to me as if it was for ever." 

" Ellen, do you know who it is that sends sickness and 
trouble upon us ?" 

" Yes, sir, I know ; but I don't feel that that makes it any 
easier." 

" Do you know why he sends it ? He is the God of love, 
— he does not trouble us willingly, — he has said so ; — why 
does lie ever make us suffer ? do you know ?" 

" No, sir." 

" Sometimes he sees that if he lets them alone, his children 
will love some dear thing on the earth better than himself, 
and he knows they will not be happy if they do so ; and 
then, because he loves them, he takes it away, — perhaps it is a 
dear mother, or a dear daughter, — or else he hinders their 
enjoyment of it ; that they may remember him, and give their 
whole hearts to him. He wants their whole hearts, that he 
may bless them. Are you one of his children, Ellen ?" 

" No, sir," said Ellen, with swimming eyes, but cast down 
to the ground. 

" How do you know that you are not ?" 

" Because I do not love the Saviour." 

"Do you not love him, Ellen ?" 

" I am afraid not, sir." 

" Why are you afraid not ? what makes you think so ?" 

" Mamma said I could not love him at all if I did not love 
him best ; and oh, sir," said Ellen weeping, " I do love 
mamma a great deal better." 

" You love your mother better than you do the Saviour ?" 

" Oh yes, sir," said Ellen ; " how can I help it ?" 

" Then if he had left you your mother, Ellen, you would 
never have cared or thought about him ?" 

Ellen was silent. 

" Is it so ? — would you, do you think ?" 

" I don't know, sir," said Ellen, weeping again, — " oh, sir ! 
how can I help it ?" 

'.' Then, Ellen, can you not see the love of your Heavenly 
Father in this trial ? He saw that his little child was in 
danger of forgetting him, and he loved you, Ellen ; and so 





he has taken your dear mother, and sent you away where you 
will have no one to look to but him ; and now he says to you, 
' My daughter, give me thy heart.' — Will you do it, Ellen ?" 

Ellen wept exceedingly while the gentleman was saying 
these words, clasping his hands still in both hers ; but she 
made no answer. He waited till she had become calmer, and 
then went on in a low tone, — 

" What is the reason that you do not love the Saviour, my 
child ?" 

" Mamma says it is because my heart is so hard." 

" That is true ; but you do not know how good and how 
lovely he is, or you could not help loving him. Do you often 
think of him, and think much of him, and ask him to show 
you himself that you may love him ?" 

" No, sir," said Ellen, — " not often." 

" You pray to him, don't you ?" 

" Yes, sir ; but not so." 

" But you ought to pray to him so. We are all blind by 
nature, Ellen ; — we are all hard-hearted ; — none of us can see 
him or love him unless he opens our eyes and touches our 
hearts ; but he has promised to do this for those that seek 
him. Do you remember what the blind man said when 
Jesus asked him what he should do for him? — he answered, 
' Lord, that I may receive my sight !' That ought to be 
your prayer now, and mine too ; and the Lord is just as 
ready to hear us as he was to hear the poor blind man ; and 
you know he cured him. Will you ask him, Ellen ?" 

A smile was almost struggling through Ellen's tears as she 
lifted her face to that of her friend, but she instantly looked 
down again. 

" Shall I put you in mind, Ellen, of some things about 
Christ that ought to make you love him with all your heart ?" 
" Oh yes, sir ! if you please." 

" Then tell me first what it is that makes you love your 
mother so much ?" 

" 0, I can't tell you, sir ; — everything, I think." 

" I suppose the great thing is that she loves you so much ?" 

" Oh yes, sir," said Ellen strongly. 

" But how do you know that she loves you ? how has she 
shown it?" 




Ellen looked at him, but could give no answer ; it seemed 
to her that she must bring the whole experience of her life 
before him to form one. 

" I suppose," said her friend, " that, to begin with the 
smallest thing, she has always been watchfully careful to pro- 
vide everything that could be useful or necessary for you : — 
she never forgot your wants, or was careless about them ?" 

" No indeed, sir." 

" And perhaps you recollect that she never minded trouble 
or expense or pain where your good was concerned ; — she 
would sacrifice her own pleasure at any time for yours ?" 

Ellen's eyes gave a quick and strong answer to this, but 
she said nothing. 

" And in all your griefs and pleasures you were sure of 
finding her ready and willing to feel with you and for you, 
and to help you if she could ? And in all the times you 
have seen her tried, no fatigue ever wore out her patience, 
nor any naughtiness of yours ever lessened her love ; she 
could not be weary of waiting upon you when you were sick, 
nor of bearing with you when you forgot your duty, — more 




" Oh yes, sir." 

" And you can recollect a great many words and looks of 
kindness and love — many and many endeavors to teach you 
And lead you in the right way — all showing the strongest 
desire for your happiness in this world, and in the next ?" 

" Oh yes, sir," said Ellen tearfully; and then added, "Do 
you know my mother, sir?" 

" No," said he, smiling, " not at all ; but my own mother has 
been in many things like this to me, and I judged yours 
might have been such to you. Have I described her right ?" 

" Yes indeed, sir," said Ellen ; — " exactly." 

" And in return for all this, you have given this dear mo- 
ther the love and gratitude of vour whole heart, haven't 
you?" 

" Indeed I have, sir ;" and Ellen's face said it more than 
her words. 

" You are very right," he said gravely, " to love such a 
mother — to give her all possible duty and affection ; — she 
deserves it. But, Ellen, in all these very things I have been 







mentioning, Jesus Christ has shown that he deserves it far 
more. Do you think, if you had never behaved like a child 
to your mother — if you had never made her the least return 
of love or regard — that she would have continued to love you 
as she does ?" 

" No, sir," said Ellen, — " I do not think she would." 

" Have you ever made any fit return to God for his goodness to you ?" 

" No, sir," said Ellen, in a low tone. 

" And yet there has been no change in his kindness. Just 
look at it, and see what he has done and is doing for you. In 
the first place, it is not your mother, but he, who has given 
you every good and pleasant thing you have enjoyed in your 
whole life. You love your mother because she is so careful to 
provide for all your wants ; but who gave her the materials to 
work with ? she has only been, as it were, the hand by which 
he supplied you. And who gave you such a mother ? — there are 
many mothers not like her ; — who put into her heart the truth 
and love that have been blessing you ever since you were 
born ? It is all — all God's doing, from first to last ; but his 
child has forgotten him in the very gifts of his mercy."
