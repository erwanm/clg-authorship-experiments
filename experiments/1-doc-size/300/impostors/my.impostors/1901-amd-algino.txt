“Oh, I should like it above all things !” 

“And now I must go. If it had not been so far, I 
should have brought the little one.” 

“Oh, I should like to see her. When are you going?” 

“This evening at four. Oh, Mam’selle, do you think it 
wrong?” in an imploring tone, longing for the comfort of 
assurance. 

“No,” answered Sylvie, stoutly, from the depths of her 
immature judgment. 

“Oh, thank you a thousand times. Might I kiss you 
just once before I go?” 

Sylvie clasped her arms about the other’s neck, and 
kissed her, not once, but a dozen times. 

“And you won’t forget the letter!” 

“Oh, no, no ! Oh, Mam’selle, may you be very, very 
happy.” 

Sylvie sat quite still on the bench after she was gone. 
Poor Laure ! How hard she had tried to be a religieiise 
no one knew. Sylvie had a vague impression, but she 
was too young to formulate any comprehensive idea. 
Only Laure had been longing for love all her life ; and 





no one had really loved her until she came to the little 
baby, Angelique Clark. It seemed such an odd name, as 
if two nationalities met in it. Sylvie had seen the baby 
months ago, but the knowledge of hozu Laure loved it 
seemed to fill and thrill every pulse in her body. And 
presently she would go away to a new life, to a new 
country ! 

Telano came, and thrust his head in her lap, then up 
in her very neck. 

‘‘No, I can’t tell even you, Telano, until, well — to- 
morrow morning maybe. If any one knew, it might all 
be spoiled. Birds in the air carry secrets, I have heard. 
Oh, what if some of them listened to Laure !” 

She turned pale with affright, and glanced about sus- 
piciously. 

“Whatever did Laure Gorgas have to talk about so 
long?” asked Barbe when Sylvie came in. 

“I’ll tell you to-morrow,” said the child. “I just want 
to think it over and over.” 

“She is almost through with her novitiate, isn’t she?” 

“Yes, I believe so,” was the rather vague reply. 

“Did she want you to come down to the convent?” 

“Oh, no.” 

Barbe felt relieved. 

“Jaques,” Sylvie said, as it was growing dusk, “walk 
a little ways down the road with me.” 

“Why, what for?” 

“To meet Monsieur Norton.” 

“What a queer idea ! He will be here soon.” 

“I want to see him,” authoritatively. 

Jaques took her hand. He always kept in mind Mon- 
sieur de Brienne’s charge. 

The young man came along with a swinging step. 
“Hello !” he exclaimed, in his forcible English. 





“Will you go down to the Convent of the Ursulines, 
and inquire if Laure Gorgas came back?” 

“Came back — from where?” in astonishment. 

“That is what I want to know, Monsieur. You need 
not ask any other question. And — huiry, please.” 

“Well, this is queer, little lady.” 

“Angelique won’t mind,” she said, consolingly. Then 
she turned Jaques about. “It is queer, Sylvie. What 
do you mean?” he asked. 

Sylvie laughed wilfully. 

In a little more than half an hour Norton returned. 
Barbe and the two girls were in the gallery. 

“What do you think, ma mie, Sylvie,” he began. 
“Laure Gorgas and one of the Sisters went down to the 
levee to take a child belonging to the mate of The 
Guardian, who has been at the convent nearly two years. 
And as they came off the gang-plank the Sister took 
some one’s arm, and she did not see that it was not 
Laure’s. She watched after the boat had pulled out, but 
no Laure came. And in her room on the pillow they 
found a slip of paper, saying that she had gone away for 
good. I suppose we would say she had eloped. Well, 
I can’t imagine a nun’s life would be very exciting.” 

“What a shocking thing! Sylvie, did you know about 
it? If this is the sort of training the nuns get — to deceive, 
to go off no one knows where — what a wretch ! Was 
that what she talked about all the morning?” 

Sylvie came and put her arms about Barbe’s neck in 
a pleading, caressing fashion. 

“You must not call her that,” she said, with sweet 
gravity. “She loved the little baby so much, and the 
baby’s father wanted her to be its mother. And Laure 
had no one to love her ; no one at all, for Mere Milhet did 
not really care, you know, or she would have wanted 




Laure to live with her always, and not put her in a con- 
vent. Think of having no one at all !” 

Sylvie gave a little sighing sob. 

“There, there! Well, I hope it will all be as she be- 
lieves. But it’s queer she should come and tell you.” 

“Why, you have had part in quite a romance,” laughed 
Roger Norton. “Poor girl, I hope all will go right with 
her.” He and Barbe exchanged glances * they knew how 
many wrongs there were in the world. 

“Of course, it will go right,” declared Sylvie, confi- 
dently. 

It was true that a little love on Mere Milhet’s part 
might have transformed Laure into a grateful daughter. 
But Mere Milhet was proud of her ancestry, and no one 
could tell about this waif. Already the poor whites 
were falling below the level of the slaves, unless some 
fortunate circumstance drew them out of the slough. 
Beauty might, but it was a dangerous inheritance. A 
man with energy could make a position for himself, but 
for a poor and friendless young girl there was the re- 
spectability of the convent or the ostracism of the other 
course. 

Mere Milhet was indignant, and the good Sisters were 
shocked. Sylvie held on to her faith, and was one day 
rewarded by a letter. She was not critical as to the 
spelling, but who could always be correct amid such 
a jargon as language was getting to be? 

They had reached Baltimore, and she had been married 
by a priest of her own Church. There was a pretty house 
and garden, only three rooms, but, oh, so delightful !
And now Monsieur Clark was going only from Baltimore 
to New York, and would be home frequently. He was 
delighted with her housekeeping, and loved her very 
fondly. The baby was well and so cunning, and Laure 




was brimming over with happiness. She was trying to 
he good every moment, in very gratitude. And she never 
said things any more that were not quite true, for Mon- 
sieur Clark was very honest and upright and tender, and 
she wanted to please him in every respect. 

There were letters, too, from Cousin Hugh. Paris 
was full of excitement and glory. The First Consul had 
been proclaimed Emperor, and that was the end of the 
republic and consulate. There was no grand atmosphere 
of liberty and equal rights, except in the New World. 
He should be prouder than ever to be an American citizen 
on his return. His stay might be longer than he thought, 
for everything was in disorder. All the countries ap- 
peared to be at war with one another, and the Corsican 
seemed likely to conquer half of Europe, for his ambitions 
were boundless. Sylvie must write to him and tell him 
how the great garden looked ; and if Telano was well, 
what she was learning, and if she had any new friends. 

‘‘Oh, I wish he would come back,” she sighed. 

Roger Norton wished it as well. It was very pleasant 
to be haunting the old house, to walk in the garden, to 
read aloud and watch Angel’s kindling eyes, to feel that 
she was capable of grasping some of the higher and finer 
truths of life. For he, like the young governor, was 
puzzled at many characteristics of the people who were 
to make the new town. “We must be initiated into the 
sacred duties of freemen and the practices of liberty,” 
said M. Poydras, who was a man beyond his time. Loy- 
alty comprehended obedience to laws, in his estimation; 
but one of the tremendous sins of the time was smuggling, 
another slave-stealing. Even the dames one met at the 
balls or dinners rehearsed with triumph some daring 
exploit of an ancestor. The tangled waterways of the 
southern coast, Grande Terre at the entrance of Barataria 





Bay, the bayous of La Fourche and Terre Bonne were 
full of hiding-places for pirates and smugglers, called 
privateers by courtesy. Many a wild romance celebrates 
the lives of the brothers Lafitte and the captains of mar- 
vellous deeds, Dominique You and Belouche. 

It was hard work making headway against Spanish 
beliefs and civilizations; for it was not to be a French or 
Spanish province, but an American State when it should 
reach an adequate population. There would have to be 
pioneers in the moral as well ‘as the material sense. And 
even then there was a curious misgiving about slavery. 
On this point Norton was glad his betrothed agreed with 
him. Barbe was horrified with the system, and yet she 
felt most of the slaves were more comfortable than if left 
to themselves. That would precipitate anarchy at once. 
And there must be some one to work. 

There was another embarrassment in a social point of 
view. This was a long engagement, a matter that was 
little in favor among the best classes. But he could not 
well hurry Angelique away from her home, and the other 
alternative was rather awkward. 

As for Gervaise, he was much comforted by Hortense. 
And although she seemed less coquettish than Zenobie, 
and very frank and innocent in her girlish ardor, she 
did some credit to Aunt Melanie’s training. She was not 
in love with Gervaise, for, although he came of “good 
family,” he was poor. Hugh de Brienne was alive, and 
possessor of all the remaining estates. And so when 
a certain Alphonse Mazant, possessing a large plantation 
on Lake Maurepas and various other properties, began 
to be seriously devoted to Aunt Melanie, she wondered 
whether it was wise to go further and, perhaps, fare 
worse. Then it would be a great delight to her to be 
married before Zenobie. 





But Zenobie was not passed by. A young Spaniard, 
whose family had made a fortune in privateering, but 
who was not really admired by Madame, and a much 
older man, well-to-do and a widower, besought her hand. 

'I don’t want to marry an old man,” she said, pet- 
tishly. “And I don’t like the Spanish. They are so 
jealous and arbitrary. Papa, there are delightful French 
people. And Claire is so happy.” 

So both lovers were dismissed. Zenobie was rather 
piqued that Gervaise should have so taken her at her 
word and transferred his visits to Hortense. She did not 
know how sharp a lookout Aunt Melanie kept, and that 
Henri was a great source of attraction as well, since they 
were both studying the new order of civil government. 
She was quite cool to Hortense, who always managed to 
say some teasing things under a great show of innocent 
sweetness. 

One evening, when gay groups were wandering down 
along the river banks, where willow and china trees and 
sedgy blossoms sent trailing shadows over the river, 
Madame Lavalette and her daughter paused to ask if 
anything had been heard of that poor misguided girl who 
had fled from the convent, and was really pleased to learn 
that she was lawfully married and well settled. 

“And she wrote Sylvie a very nice letter,” answered 
Gervaise. Then he glanced up at Zenobie.
