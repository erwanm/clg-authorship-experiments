to do this, though not without a counterpart 
in the records of the Bar, I was unmatched in 
the courts of our Eastern coast. Without a 
word of apology for the innovation, the lame 
lad's counsel launched upon a eulogy of the 
nature of the dog. 

"A man does not have to live very long," 
he said, " to discover that in this world friends 
are hard to gain, and harder to keep. At 
most they are very few. Not many of them 
are true. All of them are uncertain. None of 
them can answer the demands of our clamor- 
ing hearts. Who comes so near to meeting 
the conditions of a real friendship as your 
dog? His devotion surpasses the devotion of 
most women. His affection outvies the affec- 
tion of any man. He gives everything ; he 
asks nothing. He offers all ; he receives little. 
He comforts your loneliness ; he assuages your 
distress; he sacrifices his liberty to watch by 
you in sickness ; when every one else who 
used to love you has neglected your grave, he 
will break his heart upon it. Who fails you 
in faith ? Your dog is loyal. Who deserts

you ? Your dog never. Who gashes you with 
roughness, or bruises you with unkindness ? 
Your dog offers you the tenderness that time 
and use cannot destroy. You have from him 
the expression of the uttermost, the unselfish 
love. This little citizen of the slums, this 
wronged and suffering lad possessed a trea- 
sure which any one of us might envy — the 
true friendship of an exquisite canine nature. 
Without excuse in the nature of the deed, 
without apology in the laws of the land, sci- 
ence put out her red hand and tore from 
this afflicted boy his means of livelihood, the 
joy of his hard life, the comrade of his deso- 
lation. His tragic experience is one of hun- 
dreds that never reach the knowledge of the 
public, or the protection of the courts. The 
merciful denouement of this dark tale does 
not often await the bereaved household that 
has mysteriously lost its dumb and cherished 
friend. Yours may be such a household. 
Mine might be such bereavement. We, too, 
may be elected to share this fate into which 
the physiology of our day drags the animal 
and the human too. Y^ou have heard the de- 
fendant in this case assert that he does not 



 

know, that his institution does not know, 
where the victims of his laboratory come from. 
Your Honor ! I claim that his institution 
ought to know. I say that her faculty and 
her employees ought to know. I urge that 
the defendants should be made to know — 
by the decision of this court — where this 
material came from, and that they should 
never be permitted from this hour to forget. 
I appeal for this wronged boy against the 
slaughter-houses of science, to the law which 
is framed to protect the weak, to punish 
outrage, and to respect the sacredness of 
property." 

It seemed that Surbridge had intended to 
say something more, but, checked by his own 
agitation, and moved by the emotion in the 
court-room, he ceased abruptly. His pale face 
turned impulsively towards the girl in the far 
end of the house. It seemed to him that he 
could see her wet eyes through her veil. 

Quickly and quietly she rose and went out. 
It was as though she could not trust herself 
to witness the end of the scene. 

This came now, in a whirlwind. 

His Honor summed up briefly and sternly. 



 

He referred to the importance of this case to 
the community — to its unusual character — 
to the standing- of the defendants — to their 
evident assumption that their influential posi- 
tion would afford them immunity. The court, 
however, proposed to dispense justice impar- 
tially, regardless of the consequences. Science 
was not of such paramount importance to so- 
ciety as the observance of the laws. It was 
perfectly clear to the judge upon the evidence 
that both the defendants knew that the dog 
was stolen, and there was nothing for him to 
do in the conscientious and fearless discharge 
of his duty but to find them both guilty of 
the offense charged. 

His Honor imposed the heaviest fine that 
the law allowed ; treated the appeal with sar- 
castic contempt ; and, when he found a chance, 
said to the young attorney : " You remind me 
of your father." 

The students and the medical men went 
out in disturbed and scowling groups. But 
some of the lawyers lingered to give a hearty 
hand to Philip Surbridge. Ladies who had 
dropped their fans to put dainty handker- 
chiefs to their eyes melted away silently and 



 

thoughtfully. And the plain and powerful 
people rose to their strong feet, and — not 
knowing and not caring that it was against 
court rules to do so — cheered and roared 
like the lion that they are for Dan and 
Trixy. 



CHAPTER XIV 

The vivisector turned painfully upon his bed ; 
he had lain there now six weeks. He had 
always been a well man, and by the mystery 
of physical suffering and disability he was as 
much astonished as he was infuriated. For 
the last twelve months he had worked with a 
concentration never exceeded in his studious 
life. His laboratory had not listened in vain 
for his expected feet, and the lights in its win- 
dows had often burned late into the night. 
During the year his colleagues had noted 
that he had shifted his research away from 
the surgical direction. Whether he had been 
moved to do this through one of those delu- 
sions by which we excuse to ourselves our 
forsworn resolves, he himself could not have 
told. At all events, the work upon which he 
was now engaged — that of serum inoculation 
— was alleged to be the more merciful form 
of experimentation. 

He had not spoken to Miriam Lauriat since 



 

that morning when he was exiled from the 
paradise of her presence. He had written to 
her several times, but had received no replies. 
Beyond a passing glimpse of her in the street, 
or in some place of entertainment, he had not 
seen her face. These instantaneous views, 
caught on the sensitized plate of his conscious- 
ness, had caused him so much misery that he 
had finally withdrawn himself from all but the 
necessary attrition of life. The vow he had 
made to her still reverberated through his be- 
ing, but he excused himself from its fulfillment 
with the easy sophistry of his avocation. It 
was a conditional promise. She had not met 
the condition ; why should he sacrifice himself ? 
At midsummer, about two months ago, he 
came home from his laboratory one day with 
a slight abrasion upon his finger. He thought 
nothing of it at the time. The guinea pig 
that he had inoculated sickened and died, as 
it was intended that it should. On the day 
when the patient creature drew its last miser- 
able breath, Dr. Steele was appalled to dis- 
cover in himself the too familiar symptoms 
of the malady that he had imposed upon his 
timid and unimportant victim. 



 

His knowledge of the nature and conse- 
quences of the disorder constituted its acutest 
feature. He longed for the happy simplicity 
of the layman ; he prayed that certain cells of 
his brain might be dispossessed of their techni- 
cal training ; he would have bartered twenty 
years of education for the dull foresight of a 
man who would know only what his physician 
chose to tell ; he would have sold his brilliant 
reputation for a merciful nescience of his ad- 
vancing fate. 

Steele, as we say, had never been really ill 
before ; we might add that he had never truly 
been alone before. The inevitable solitude of 
sickness — at its best neither tolerated nor un- 
derstood by the well and the gregarious — was 
in his instance rather pitiably uncompanioned. 
His mother was dead ; his brother was in Cali- 
fornia ; and his sister's infrequent visits came 
like ice in April. The attendance of the staff of 
Galen College did not mitigate his desolation, 
any more than it cured his disorder. He was 
alone with his nurse, his servants, and his old 
dog. Tibbs and Barry were about the same 
age, so to speak, and both had well outgrown 
the impatience that youth feels with the sick. 



 

Olin's sister came in on the day of which 
we tell, to make a little duty call. It was with 
evident reluctance that she crossed the sick- 
room. She sat down on a chair at some 
distance from the bed, and prattled her per- 
functory sympathy. 

Did he en j oy the flowers ? Should she send 
another tumbler of that jelly ? Could he read 
some wholesome, cheerful novels? Her hus- 
band sent his kindest regards. Any more let- 
ters from Dick ? How well he was doing at 
the head of that institution ! All her friends 
were proud of him. He was a credit to the 
family, he enjoyed the climate, and said he 
never was so well in his life. 

" I must say, Olin — of course, you know, 
I am very sorry for you, but I should have 
thought you had experience enough not to get 
yourself into such a scrape as this. Still, I sup- 
pose, it 's very interesting studying your own 
symptoms, especially when they are so rare. 
You 'll be writing a pamphlet about it some 
day." 

" Oh, do be still, Jess! " groaned Olin. He 
buried his face in his pillow savagely. 

" Well, I 'm sure ! " exclaimed Jess. " It 's 



 

no use trying to sympathize with you." She 
pouted, and he heard her skirts swishing out 
of the room. 

Agitated by the disturbance of his sister's 
call, Olin flung himself into a rise of tempera- 
ture, and feverishly rang for water and an 
open window. The nurse was off duty, being 
out for her two hours' relief, and Tibbs did 
not hear the bell. Steele called and called 
again, but no one answered him. The sudden 
tears of weakness scalded his eyes. He thought 
of his mother with a boyish, almost a senti- 
mental longing. 

"Nobody cares," he muttered. "I am a 
sick — I am a desolate man." 

His reflections ran a bitter race. He who 
had achieved almost supremely ; he whose 
value science had rated so highly ; he whose 
name was pushed to the front in medical 
journals ; he whose college honored him 
above the alumni of his time ; he for whose 
revolutionizing discoveries humanity was said 
to be waiting — he lay there parched and 
neglected. He had sown professional fame ; 
he had reaped a poisoned isolation. He 
flung himself over in a helpless fury, and his
