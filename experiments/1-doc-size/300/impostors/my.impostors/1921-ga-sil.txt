the old house, and keep her wardrobe up to mark after 
she went out of mourning. She knew nothing of the 
value of money, and was accustomed to having little to 
spend and everything provided. But her mind regarding finances was quite at rest. Even if Mortimer remained a victim of the hard times, they would be quite 
comfortable. 

The cares of housekeeping were very light. She discussed the daily menus with James, but he had run 
Ballinger House for years, little as Mrs. Groome had 
suspected it. Mortimer, shortly after his mother-in- 
law's death, and while Alexina was passing a fortnight 
at Rincona, had given James orders to eoUect all bills on 



 

the first of every month and hand them to him, together 
with a statement of the servants' wages. Mrs. Dwight 
was not to be bothered. ' 

Alexina, when she returned, had made no protest. 
The details of housekeeping did not appeal to her. But 
the arrangement left her without occupation, and much 
time for thought. After a long walk morning and afternoon she had little to do but read. She was an early 
riser and her mind was active. 

IV 

Dwight had not the least intention of using his wife's 
money, for he had perfect confidence in his change of 
luck, and in his ability to do great things with his business as soon as the period of depression had passed. But 
he had no faith in any woman's ability to invest and 
take care of money, he had fixed ideas in regard to a 
man being master in his own house, and he had asked 
Alexina for her power of attorney more to flaunt her 
confidence in him and to annoy her damnable relatives 
than because there might possibly be a moment when he 
should have need of immediate resources. Like many| 
Americans he chose to keep his wife in ignorance of his 
business life, and it would have annoyed him excessively 
to go to her with an explanation of temporary difficulties and ask for a loan. i 

Moreover, he wished to keep Alexina young and superficial, ignorant of money matters, indifferent to the sordid responsibilities of life. Not only was the present 
Alexina no embarrassment whatever to a man full of 
schemes, aside from the slow march of business, for getting rich, but she was infinitely alluring. 

He detested business women, intellectual women, 
women with careers; they tipped the even balance of 
the man's world; moreover, they had no accepted place 
in the higher social scheme. For women wage-earners 
he had no antipathy and much sympathy and consideration, although he underpaid them cheerfully when circumstances would permit. It was an abiding canker 
that his sister was obliged to support herself; he was 



 

not ashamed of it, for nursing was an honorable (and 
altruistic) profession, and several young women in his 
new circle had taken it up; but he hated it as a man 
and a brother. As for her turning herself into an 
authoress, however, he only hoped he would make his 
million before she got herself talked about. 

As for Alexiaa she was the perfect flower of a system 
he worshiped and nothing should mar or change her 
if his fond surveillance could prevent it. 

On the whole he was quite happy at this time, despite 
his passionate desire for wealth and his natural resentment at the attitude of the Abbotts and their intimate 
circle of old friends who were so like them that he always 
included them in his mind when speaking of "the family." Although he was making barely enough to pay 
his sister the monthly interest on her money, the salaries 
of his employees, and, until recently, a monthly contribution to the household expenses, he had a comfortable and delightful home with not a few of the minor 
luxuries, an undisputed position in the best society, an 
honorable one in the business world, and a beautiful 
wife. Now that the conventions forced them to live the 
retired life, they could economise without attracting 
attention; as he paid the bills Alexina would not know 
whether he still contributed his share or not; (in time 
he meant to pay the whole and give his wife, with the 
grand gesture, her entire income for pin money) and, 
with Alexina 's cordial assent, he had sold the old carriage, and the horses, which were eating their heads off, 
dismissed the coachman-gardener, and found a young 
Swede to take care of the garden and outbuildings. 

Later, they would have their car like other people, but 
there was no need for it at present, and it was neither 
the time nor the occasion to exhibit a tendency to extravagance. In the matter of "front" he knew precisely where to leave off. 



In a certain small anxious bag-of-tricks way he was 
clever. But not clever enough. He knew nothing of 



 

Alexina beneath her shining surface. If he had he 
would have sought to crowd her mind with the details 
of the home, encouraged her to join in the frantic activities of some one of the women's clubs he held in scorn, 
persuaded her to play golf daily at the fashionable club 
of which they were members, even though she ran the 
risk of talking, unehaperoned by himself, with other 
men. 

He never would have left her to long hours of idleness, with only books for companions (and Alexina cared 
little for novels lacking in psychology, or in revelations 
of the many phases of life of which she was personally 
so ignorant) ; and only his own companionship evening 
after evening. 

But he had known all the Alexina he was ever to 
know. Such flashing glimpses as he was destined to have 
later so bewildered him that he reacted obstinately to his 
original estimate of her, . . . just a child under the influence of her family or some of those friends of hers 
who had always hated him . . . erratic and irresponsible like all women ... a man never could understand 
women because there was nothing to understand . . . 
merely a bundle of contradictions. . . . 

In some ways his mental equipment was an enviable 
one. 

VI 

Some of all this Alexina guessed, and although she 
was nettled at times that he took no note of ier maturing 
mind and character, she was, on the whole, more amused. 

Indulgent by nature, and somewhat indolent, she had 
been more than willing that Morty should enjoy his new 
authority, should even delude himself that he was footing all the bills, poor dear ; and she listened raptly to his 
evening visions of their future life in Burlingame, alternated with visits to New York and England, the while 
she puzzled over the intricacies of some character portrayed by a master analyst. 

Sometimes he did not talk at all, utterly fagged by a 
strenuous day in which he had accomplished precisely 
nothing. But the more transparent and truncated and 



 

dull he grew the more spontaneous the "niceness" and 
almost effusive courtesy of his wife. Insensibly she was 
veering to the family attitude, but he had tagged her 
once for all and never saw it. 

Until this moment, however, when Gathbroke had been 
jerked from his deep seclusion within her ivory tower by 
Aileen's unwelcome news, she had never had a moment 
of complete self-revelation. . . . She knew instantly that 
she had never loved her husband: he was not her mate 
and Gathbroke was. She had had three years of rippling 
content and light enjoyment with Mortimer, they had 
never quarreled seriously, and they had never taken 
their parts in one moment of real drama. 

If she had married Gathbroke they would have quarreled furiously, they would have thrown courtesy and 
behavior to the winds often enough, particularly while 
they were young, for neither would have been in the 
least apprehensive of wounding the rank-pride of the 
other, and such mutual and passionate love as theirs 
naturally gave birth to a high state of irritability ; they 
would have loved and hated and made constant discoveries about each other . . . there would have been depths 
never to be fully explored but always luring them on 
. . . and the perfect companionship . . . the complete 
fusion. . . . 

How Alexina knew all this after less than three hours' 
association with Gathbroke, let any woman answer. She 
was not so foolish as to imagine herself the victim of a 
secret passion, or that she had ever loved the man, or 
ever would. She had merely had her chance for the 
great duodrama, and thrown it away for a callow dream. 
She had no passing wish, even in that moment of visualizing him interlocked with her own wraith in that sacred 
inner temple where even she had never intruded before, 
to meet him again. She had no intention of passing any 
of her abundant leisure in dreaming dreams of him and 
the perfect bliss. But he had been hers . . . and utterly 
... he had loved her ... he had wanted her ... he 
had precipitately begged her to marry him ... he had 
offered her the homage of complete brutality. 

Something of him would always be hers. 



 

And even thougli she renounced all rights in him. because she must, she did not in the least relish that anyone so close to her as Gora Dwight should have him. 
She might have heard of his marriage to a girl of his 
own land and class with only a passing spasm, but his 
continued and possibly tender friendship with her sister- 
in-law shook her out of the last of her jejunity and its 
illusions. . . . She was not exactly a dog in the manger 
. . . she was a maturing woman looking back with anger 
and dismay not only upon the fatal mistake of her youth, 
but upon the inexorable realities of her present life. , . , 

The reaction was a more intense feeling of loyalty to 
Mortimer than ever. She was entirely to blame. He 
not only had been innocent of conscious rivalry, even of 
pursuit — for she could quite easily have discouraged him 
in the earlier stages of his courtship — but he was dependent upon her in every way: for his happiness, for 
the secure social position that meant so much to him, for 
the greater number of his valuable connections, for even 
his comfort and ease of living. 

Something of this had passed through her stunned 
mind on the morning of her mother's death. Now it was 
all as sharply outlined as the etching at which she was 
raptly gazing, and she vowed anew that she would never 
desert him, never deny him the assistance of the true 
partner. She had signed a life contract with her eyes 
open and she would keep it to the letter. 

Only she hoped to heaven that Gathbroke was not 
serious about Gora. She wished never to be reminded of 
his existence again. 

And, as Aileen talked of Santa Barbara, she wondered 
vaguely why there was not a law forbidding girls to 
marry until they were well into their twenties . . . until 
they had had a certain amount of experience . . . knew 
their own minds. . . . Maria had been right. . . . 



 



CHAPTER VI 



THE darkness had come early with the high rolling 
 fog that shut out the stars. The fog horn and the 
bells were silent but the wind had a thin anxious note 
as if lost, and the long creaking eucalyptus trees angrily 
repelled it as if irritated beyond endurance by its eternal 
visitations. 

Alexina, who had been reading in her bedroom, realized that it must be quite half an hour since she had 
turned a page. She lifted her shoulders impatiently. 
She was in no humor for reading. 

It was only eight o'clock. Far too early for bed. 
Mortimer had gone to Los Angeles on business. He had 
been gone a week, and she admitted to herself with the 
new frankness she had determined to cultivate — that she 
might meet, with the clearest possible vision, whatever 
three-cornered deals Life might have ia store for her — 
that she had not missed him at all. His absence had 
been a heavenly interlude. She and AUeen had gone to 
the moving pictures unescorted every night (a performance of which he would have disapproved profoundly), 
and they had lunched downtown every day until Alexina 
had suddenly discovered that she had no more money in 
her purse ; and, knowing nothing whatever even of minor 
finance, was under the impression that having given 
Mortimer her power of attorney she would not be able 
to draw from the bank. 

Aileen had gone down to Burlingame to visit Sibyl 
Bascom for a few days. Alexina had declined to go, 
although it was a quiet party ; it would be embarrassing 
not to tip the servants. 

The wind gave a long angry shriek as it flew round 
the corner of the house and fastened its teeth in its 
enemies, the eucalyptus trees; who shook it off with a 
loud furious rattle of their leaves and slapped the window severely for good measure. 

Alexina was used to San Francisco in all her many 



 

moods, but to-night, the wind and the high gray fog 
shutting out the stars, the silent house — silent that is 
but for the mice playing innocently between the walls — 
her complete solitude, made her restless and a little 
nervous. 

What could she do? 

She knew quite well that she had wanted to go to see 
Gora for a week. She had not indulged in any silly 
dreams about Gathbroke but she was curious to see bis 
photograph. She remembered that it had crossed her 
mind that April day under the oak tree that if he had 
been older, if he had outgrown his hopelessly youthful 
curve of cheek, his fresh color, and the inability to conceal the asinine condition to which she had immediately 
reduced him, she might have given him an equal chance 
with Morty. 

Aileen had said that he looked older. She had a quite
