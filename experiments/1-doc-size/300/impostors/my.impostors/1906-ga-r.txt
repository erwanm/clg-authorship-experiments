moment and miss you. Excellency, will you 
give your arm to Doha Ignacia and take the 
seat at the head of the table? Concha, my child, 
I am afraid you must console our good Don Weeliam. He is having a wretched quarter of an hour, 
but has loyally diverted the attention of your 
mother. ' ' 

" That is the vocation of certain men,'' said 
Concha lightly.

Life was very gay for a fortnight. An 
hour after the Comandante 's surrender he 
had despatched invitations to all the young folk 
of the Gente de Eazon of Monterey, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and to such of 
the older as would brave the long journeys. 
The Monterehos had arrived for the Mission entertainment, and during the next few days the 
rest poured over the hills : De la Guerras, 
Ximenos, Estudillos, Carrillos, Estenegas, 
Morenos, Cotas, Estradas, Picos, Pachecos, 
Lugos, Ortegas, Alvarados, Bandinis, Peraltas, 
members of the Luis, Kodriguez, Lopez families 
all of gentle blood, that made up the society of 
Old California; as gay, arcadian, irresponsible, 
yet moral a society as ever fluttered over this 
planet. Every house in the Presidio and valley, 
every spare room at the Mission, opened to them 
with the exuberant hospitality of the country. 
The caballeros had their finest wardrobes of colored silks and embroidered botas, sombreros 
laden with silver, fine lawn and lace, jewel and 




sash, velvet serape for the chill of the late afternoon. The matrons brought their stiff robes of 
red and yellow satin, the girls as many flowered 
silks and lawns, mantillas and rebosos, as the 
family carretas would hold. The square of the 
Presidio was crowded from morning until mid- 
night with the spirited horses of the country, 
prancing impatiently under the heavy Mexican 
saddle, heavier with silver, made a trifle more 
endurable by the blanket of velvet or cloth. No 
Californian walked a dozen rods when he had a 
horse to carry him. 

But the horses were not always champing in 
the square. There was more than one bull-bear 
fight, and twice a week at least they carried their 
owners to the hills of the Mission ranch, or the 
rocky cliffs and gorges above Yerba Buena, the 
Indian servants following with great baskets of 
luncheon, perhaps roasting an ox whole in a 
trench. This the Californians called barbecue 
and the picnic merienda. 

There was dancing day and night, the tinkling 
of guitars, flirting of fans. Eezanov vowed he 
would not have believed there were so many fans 
and guitars in the world, and suddenly remembered he had never seen Concha with either. 




The lady of his choice reigned supreme. Many 
had taken the long blistering journey for no 
other purpose than to see the famous beauty and 
her Russian; the engagement was as well known 
as if cried from the Mission top. The girls were 
surprised and delighted to jond Concha sweet 
rather than proud and envied her with amiable 
enthusiasm. The caballeros, fewer in number, 
for most of the men in California at that period 
before a freer distribution of land were on duty 
in the army, artfully ignored the unavowed bond, 
but liked Rezanov when he took the trouble to 
charm them. 

Khostov and Davidov watched the loading of 
the Juno with a lively regret. Never had they 
enjoyed themselves more, nor seen so many 
pretty girls in one place. Both had begun by 
falling in love with Concha, and although they 
rebounded swiftly from the blow to their hopes, 
it happily saved them from a more serious dilemma; unwealthed and graceless as they were, 
they would have been regarded with little favor 
by the practical Californian father. As it was, 
their pleasures were unpoisoned by regrets or 
rebuff. When they were not flirting in the dance 
or in front of a lattice, receiving a lesson in Spanish behind the portly back of a duena, or clasp- 
ing brown little fingers under cover of a fan when 
all eyes were riveted on the death struggle of a 
bull and a bear, they were plajdng cards and 
drinking in the officers ' quarters ; which they liked 
almost as well. It is true they sometimes paid 
the price in a cutting rebuke from their chief, but 
the rebukes were not as frequent as in less toward 
circumstances, and were generally followed by 
some fresh indulgence. This, they uneasily 
guessed, was not only the result of the equable 
state of his excellency's temper, but because he 
had a signal unpleasantness in store, and would 
not hazard their resignation. They had taken advantage of an imperial ukase to enter the service 
of the Russian-American Company temporarily, 
and they knew that if they evaded any behest 
of Rezanov's their adventurous life in the Pacific 
would be over. Therefore, although they resented his implacable will, they pulled with him in 
outward amity; and indeed there were few of 
the Juno's human freight that did not look back 
upon that California springtime as the episode 
of their lives, commonly stormy or monotonous, 
in which the golden tide flowed with least alloy. 
Even Langsdorff, although impervious to female 



 

charms and with scientific thirst unslaked, enjoyed the Spanish fare and the society of the 
priests. The sailors received many privileges, 
attended bull-fights and fandangos, loved and 
pledged; and were only restrained from emigration to the interior of this enchanted land of 
pretty girls and plentiful food by the knowledge 
of the sure and merciless vengeance of their chief. 
Had the rumor of war still held it might have been 
otherwise, but that raven had flown off to the 
limbo of its kind, and the Comandante let it be 
known that deserters would be summarily captured and sent in irons to the Juno, 

In the mind of Concha Argiiello there was never 
a lingering doubt of the quality of that fortnight 
between the days of torturing doubts and acute 
emotional upheaval, and the sailing away of Rezanov. It was true that what he banteringly 
termed her romantic sadness possessed her at 
times, but it served as a shadow to throw into 
sharper relief an almost incredible happiness. 
If she seldom saw Rezanov alone there was the 
less to disturb her, and at least he was never far 
from her side. There were always the delight 
of unexpected moments unseen, whispered words 
in the crowd, the sense of complete understanding, broken now and again by poignant attacks 
of unreasoning jealousy, not only on her part but 
his; quite worth the reconciliation at the lattice, 
while Elena Castro, gentle dueiia, pitched her 
voice high and amused her husband so well he 
sought no opportunity for response. 

Then there was more than one excursion about 
the bay on the Juno, dinner on La Bellissima or 
Nuestra Sehora de los Angeles, a long return after 
sundown that the southerners might appreciate 
the glory of the sunsets, when the blue of the 
water was reflected in the lower sky, to melt into 
the pink fire above, and all the land swam in a 
pearly mist. 

Once the Comandante took twenty of his 
guests, a gay cavalcade, to his rancho. El Pilar, 
thirty miles to the south : a long valley flanked by 
the bay and the eastern mountains on the one 
hand, and a high range dense with forests of tall 
thin trees on the other. But the valley itself was 
less Californian than any part of the country 
Eezanov had seen. Smooth and flat and free of 
undergrowth and set with at least ten thousand 
oaks, it looked more like a splendid English park, 
I long preserved, than the recent haunt of naked 
savages. There were deer and quail in abundance, 




here and there an open field of grain. Long beards 
of pale green moss waved from the white oaks, 
wild flowers, golden red and pale blue, burst underfoot. There were hedges of sweet brier, acres 
of lupins, purple and yellow. Altogether the ideal 
estate of a nobleman ; and Eezanov, who had liked 
nothing in California so well, gave his imagination rein and saw the counterpart of the castle of 
his ancestors rise in the deep shade of the trees. 

Don Jose's house was a long rambling adobe, 
red tiled, with many bedrooms and one immense 
hall. Beyond was a chapel and a dozen out-buildings. Dinner was served in patriarchal style in 
the hall, the Comandante — or El Padrone as he 
was known here — and his guests at the upper end 
of the table; below the salt, the vaqueros, their 
wives and children, and the humble friar who 
drove them to prayer night and morning. The friar 
wore his brown robes, the vaqueros their black 
and silver and red in honor of the company, their 
women glaring handkerchiefs of green or red or 
yellow about their necks, even pinned back and 
front on their shapeless garments; and affording 
a fine vegetable garden contrast to the delicate 
flower bed surrounding the padrone. 

There was a race track on the ranch and many 



fine horses. After siesta the company mounted 
fresh steeds and rode off to applaud the feats of 
the vaqueros, who not content with climbing the 
greased pole, wrenching the head of an un- 
fortunate rooster from his buried body as they 
galloped by, submitting the tail of an oiled pig 
in full flight to the same indignity, gave when these 
and other native diversions were exhausted, 
such exhibitions of riding and racing as have 
never been seen out of California. As lithe as 
willow wands, on slender horses as graceful as 
themselves, they looked like meteors springing 
through space, and there was no trick of the circus 
they did not know by instinct and translate from 
gymnastics into poetry. Even Eezanov shared 
the excitement of the shouting clapping Californians, and Concha laughed delightedly when 
his cap waved with the sombreros. 

'' I think you will make a good Calif ornian in 
time," she said as they rode homeward. 

" Perhaps," said Eezanov musingly. His eyes 
roved over the magnificent estate and at the moment they entered a portion of it that deepened 
to woods, so dense was the undergrowth, so thick 
the oak trees. Here there was but a glimpse, now 
and again, of the mountains swimming in the dark 



 

blue mist of the late afternoon, the moss waved 
thickly from the ancient trees; over even the 
higher branches of many rolled a cascade of small 
brittle leaves, with the tempting opulence of its 
poisonous sap. The path was very abrupt, cut 
where the immense spreading trees permitted, 
and Eezanov and Concha had no difficulty in falling away from the chattering excited company. 

" Tell me your ultimate plans, Pedro mio,'' 
said Concha softly. " You are dreaming of something this moment beyond corn and treaties." 

" Do you want that final proof! '' he asked, 
smiling. " Well, if I could not trust you that 
would be the end of everything, and I know that I 
can. I have long regarded California as an absolutely necessary field of supplies, and since I 
have come here I will frankly say that could I, 
as the representative of the Tsar in all this part 
of the world, make it practically my own, I should 
be content in even a permanent exile from St. 
Petersburg. I could attract an immense colony 
here and in time import libraries and works of 
art, laying the foundation of a great and im- 
portant city on that fine site about Yerba Buena. 
But now that these kind people have practically 
adopted me I cannot repay their hospitality by 




any overt act of hostility. I must be content either 
slowly to absorb the country, in which case I shall 
see no great result in my lifetime, or — and for 
this I hope — what with the mess Bonaparte is 
making of Europe every state may be at the 
others' throat before long, including Eussia and 
Spain. At all events, a cause for rupture would 
not be far to seek, and it would need no instigation of mine to despatch a fleet to these shores. 
In that case I should be sent with it to take possession in the name of the Tsar, and to deal 
with these simple, kind — and inefficient people, my 
dear girl — as no other Eussian could. They cannot hold this country. Spain could not — would 
not, at all events, for she has not troops enough 
here to protect a territory half its size — hold it 
ag-ainst even the ' Americans, ' should they in time 
feel strong enough to push their way across the 
Western wilderness. It is the destiny of this 
charming Arcadia to disappear; and did Eussia 
forego an opportunity to appropriate a domain 
that offers her literally everything except civilization, she would be unworthy of her place among 
nations. Moreover — a beneficent triumph impossible to us otherwise — with a powerful and 
nourishing colony up and down this coast, and 

sending breadstuffs regularly to our other possessions in these waters nntil the natives, immigrants, and exiles were healthy vitalized beings, it 
would be but a question of a few years before we 
should force open the doors of China and Japan. " 
He caught Concha from her horse and strained 
her to him in the mounting ardor of his plunge 
down the future. " You must resent nothing! " 
he cried. " You must cease to be a Spanisli 
woman when you become my wife, and help me and
only you can in those inevitable years I have 
mapped out; and not so much for myself as for 
Eussia. My enemies have sought to persuade 
three sovereigns that I am a visionary, but I have 
already accomplished much that met with resentment and ridicule when I broached it. And I know 
my powers ! I tingle with the knowledge of my 
ability to carry to a conclusion every plan I have
