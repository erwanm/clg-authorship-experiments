places. I have looked in at the churches when they are 
in progress, now and then, and been struck with the gen- 
eral good feeling of the occasion. The real mourners, I 
could not always distinguish; but the seats would be 



  

filled with a motley gathering of the idle and the ragged, 
 who seemed to enjoy the show and the ceremony. On 
one occasion, it was the obsequies of an officer in the 
army. Guarding the gilded casket, which stood upon a 
raised platform before the altar, were four soldiers in uni- 
form. Mass was being said and sung ; and a priest was 
playing the organ. The church was light and cheerful, 
and pervaded by a pleasant bustle. Kagged boys and 
beggars, and dirty children and dogs, went and came 
wherever they chose about the unoccupied spaces of the 
church. The hired mourners, who are numerous in pro- 
portion to the rank of the deceased, were clad in white 
cotton, — a sort of night-gown put on over the ordinary 
clothes, with a hood of the same drawn tightly over the 
face, in which slits were cut for the eyes and mouth. 
Some of them were seated on benches near the front ; 
others were wandering about among the pillars, disap- 
pearing in the sacristy, and re-appearing with an aimless 
aspect, altogether conducting themselves as if it were a 
holiday, and, if there was any thing they did enjoy, it was 
mourning at other people's expense. They laughed and 
talked with each other in excellent spirits ; and one varlet 
near the coffin, who had slipped off his mask, winked at 
me repeatedly, as if to inform me that it was not his 
funeral. A masquerade might Lave been more gloomy 
and depressing. 



 

THE most serviceable saint whom I know is St. Anto- 
nino. He is the patron saint of the good town of 
Sorrento ; he is the good genius of all sailors and fisher- 
men ; and he has a humbler oflice, — that of protector of 
the pigs. On his day the pigs are brought into the pub- 
lic square to be blessed ; and this is one reason why the 
pork of Sorrento is reputed so sweet and wholesome. 
The saint is the friend, and, so to say, companion of the 
common people. They seem to be all fond of him, and 
there is little of fear in their confiding relation. His 
humble origin and plebeian appearance have something 
to do with his popularity, no doubt. There is nothing 
awe-inspiring in the brown stone figure, battered and 
cracked, that stands at one corner of the bridge, over the 
chasm at the entrance of the city. He holds a crosier in 
one hand, and raises the other, with fingers uplifted, in 
act of benediction. If his face is an indication of his 
character, he had in him a mixture of robust good-nature 
witt a touch of vulgarity, and could rough it in a jolly 
manner with fishermen and peasants. He may have 
appeared to better advantage when he stood on top 
of the massive old city gate, which the present Govern- 
ment, with the impulse of a Vandal, took down a few 
years ago. The demolition had to be accomplished in the 
night, under a guard of soldiers, so indignant were the 
populace. At that time the homely saint was deposed ; 
and he wears now, I think, a snubbed and cast-aside 
aspect. Perhaps he is dearer to the people than ever ; 
 



  

and I confess that I like him much better than many 
grander saints, in stone, I have seen in more conspicuous 
places. If ever I am in rough water and foul weather, I 
hope he will not take amiss any thing I have here written 
about him. 

Sunday, and it happened to be St. Valentine's also, 
was the great fete-day of St. Antonino. Early in the 
morning there was a great clanging of bells ; and the 
ceremony of the blessing of the pigs took place, I heard, 
but I was not abroad early enough to see it, — a laziness 
for which I fancy I need not apologize, as the Catholic 
is known to be an earlier religion than the Protestant. 
When I did go out, the streets were thronged with peo- 
ple, the country-folk having come in from miles around. 
The church of the patron saint was the great centre of 
attraction. The blank walls of the little square in front, 
and of the narrow streets near, were hung with cheap and 
highly-colored lithographs of sacred subjects, for sale ; 
tables and booths were set up in every available space 
for the traffic in pre-Raphaelite gingerbread, molasses 
candy, strings of dried nuts, pine-cone and pumpkin seeds, 
scarfs, boots and shoes, and all sorts of trumpery. One 
dealer had pre-empted a large space on the pavement, 
where he had spread out an assortment of bits of old iron, 
nails, pieces of steel traps, and various fragments which 
might be useful to the peasants. The press was so great, 
that it was difficult to get through it ; but the crowd was 
a picturesque one, and in the highest good-humor. The 
occasion was a sort of Fourth of July, but without its 
worry and powder and flowing bars. 

The spectacle of the day was the procession, bearing 
the silver image of the saint through the streets. I 
think there could never be any thing finer or more impres- 
sive ; at least, I like these little fussy provincial displays, 
— these tag-rags and ends of grandeur, in which all the 
populace devoutly believe, and at which they are lost in 
wonder, — better than those imposing ceremonies at the 
capital, in which nobody believes. There was first a 


band of musicians, walking in more or less disorder, but 
blowing away with reat zeal, so that they could be heard 
amid the clangor of bells the peals of which reverberate 
so deafeningly between the high houses of these narrow 
streets. Then follow boys in white, and citizens in black 
and white robes, carrying huge silken banners, triangular 
like sea-pennants, and splendid silver crucifixes which 
flash- in the sun. Then come ecclesiastics, walking with 
stately step, and chanting in loud and pleasant unison. 
These are followed by nobles, among whom I recognize, 
with a certain satisfaction, two descendants of Tasso, 
whose glowing and bigoted soul may rejoice in the devo- 
tion of his posterity, who help to bear to-day the gilded 
platform upon which is the solid silver image of the saint. 
The good old bishop walks humbly in the rear, in full 
canonical rig, with crosier and mitre, his rich robes 
upborne by priestly attendants, his splendid footman at 
a respectful distance, and his roomy carriage not far 
behind. 

The procession is well spread out and long ; all its 
members carry lighted tapers, a good many of which are 
not lighted, having gone out in the wind. As I squeeze 
into a shallow doorway to let the corteqe pass, I am sony 
to say that several of the young fellows in white gowns 
tip me the wink, and even smile in a knowing fashion, 
as if it were a mere lark, after all, and that the saint must 
know it. But not so thinks the paternal bishop, who 
waves a blessing, which I catch in the flash of the enor- 
mous emerald on his right hand. The procession ends, 
where it started, in the patron's church ; and there his 
image is set up under a gorgeous canopy of crimson and 
gold, to hear high mass, and some of the choicest solos, 
choruses, and bravuras from the operas. 

In the public square I find a gaping and wondering 
crowd of rustics, collected about one of the mountebanks 
whose trade is not peculiar to any country. This one 
might be a clock-peddler from Connecticitt. He is 
mounted in a one-seat vettura, and his horse is quietly 




eating his dinner out of a bag tied to his nose. There 
is nothing unusual in the fellow's dress ; he wears a 
shiny silk hat, and has one of those grave faces which 
would be merry if their owner were not conscious of 
serious business on hand. On the driver's perch before 
him are arranged his attractions, — a box of notions, a 
grinning skull, Avith full teeth and jaws that work on 
hinges, some vials of red liquid, and a closed jar contain- 
ing a most disagreeable anatomical preparation. This 
latter he holds up and displays, turning it about occa- 
sionally in an admiring manner. He is discoursing, all the 
time, in the most voluble Italian. He has an ointment, 
wonderfully efficacious for rheumatism and every sort of 
bruise : he pulls up his sleeve, and anoints his arm with 
it, binding it up with a strip of paper ; for the simplest 
operation must be explained to these grown children. 
He also pulls teeth, with an ease and expedition hitherto 
unknown, and is in no want of patients among this open- 
mouthed crowd. One sufferer after another climbs up 
into the wagon, and goes through the operation in the 
public gaze. A stolid, good-natured hind mounts the seat. 
The dentist examines his mouth, and finds the offending 
tooth. He then turns to the crowd, and explains the 
case. He takes a little instrument that is neither forceps 
nor turnkey, stands upon the seat, seizes the man's nose, 
and jerks his head round between his knees, pulling 
his mouth open (there is nothing that opens the mouth 
quicker than a sharp upward jerk of the nose) with a 
rude jollity that sets the spectators in a roar. Down he 
goes into the cavern, and digs away for a quarter of a 
minute, the man the while as immovable as a stone 
image, when he holds up the bloody tooth. The patient 
still persists in sitting with his mouth stretched open to 
its widest limit, waiting for the operation to begin, and 
will only close the orifice when he is well shaken and 
shown the tooth. The dentist gives him some yellow 
liquid to hold in his mouth, which the man insists on 
swallowing, wets a handkerchief and washes his face, 




rougHy rubbing his nose the wrong way, and lets him 
go. Every step of the process is eagerly watched by 
the delighted spectators. 

He is succeeded by a woman, who is put through the 
same heroic treatment, and exhibits like fortitude. And 
so they come ; and the dentist after every operation 
waves the extracted trophy high in air, and jubilates 
as if he had won another victory, pointing to the stone 
statue yonder, and reminding them that this is the 
glorious day of St. Antonino. But this is not all that 
this man of science does. He has the genuine elixir 
d'amour, love-philters and powders which never fail in 
their effects. I see the bashful girls and the sheepish 
swains come slyly up to the side of the wagon, and ex- 
change their hard-earned francs for the hopeful prepara- 
tion. O my brown beauty, with those soft eyes and 
cheeks of smothered fire, you have no need of that red 
philter ! What a simple, childlike folk ! The shrewd 
fellow in the waggon is one of a race as old as Thebes and 
as new as Porkopolis ; his brazen face is older than the 
invention of bronze, but I think he never had to do with 
a more credulous crowd than this. The very cunning in 
the face of the peasants is that of the fox ; it is a sort of 
instinct, and not an intelligent suspicion. 

This is Sunday in Sorrento, under the blue sky. These 
peasants, who are fooled by the mountebank and at- 
tracted by the piles of adamantine gingerbread, do not 
forget to crowd the church of the saint at vespers, and 
kneel there in humble faith ; while the choir sings the 
Agnus Dei, and the priests drone the service. Are they 
so different, then, from other people? They have an 
idea on Capri that England is such another island, only 
not so pleasant ; that all Englishmen are rich, and con- 
stantly travel to escape the dreariness at home ; and 
that, if they are not absolutely mad, they are all a little 
queer. It was a fancy prevalent in Hamlet's day. We 
had the English service in the Villa Nardi in the even- 
ing. There are some Englishmen staying here, of the 



  

class one finds in all the sunny spots of Europe, ennuy€ 
and growling, in search of some elixir that shall bring 
back youth and enjoyment. They seem divided in mind 
between the attractions of the equable climate of this 
region, and the fear of the gout which lurks in the unfer- 
mented wine. One cannot be too grateful to the sturdy 
islanders for carrying their prayers, like their drum-beat, 
all round the globe ; and I was much edified that night, 
as the reading went on, by a row of rather battered men 
of the world, who stood in line on one side of the room, 
and took their prayers with a certain British fortitude, 
as if they were conscious of performing a constitutional 
duty, and helping by the act to uphold the majesty of 
English institutions. 



PUNTA BELLA CAMPANELLA. 

THERE is always a mild excitement about mount- 
ing donkeys in the morning here for an excursion 
among the hills. The warm sun pouring into the gar- 
den, the smell of oranges, the stimulating air, the general 
openness and freshness, promise a day of enjoyment. 
There is always a doubt as to who will go ; generally a 
donkey wanting ; somebody wishes to join the party at 
the last moment; there is no end of running up and 
down stairs, calling from balconies and terraces ; some 
never ready, and some waiting below in the sun; the 
whole house in a tumult, drivers in a worry, and the 
sleepy animals now and then joining in the clatter with 
a vocal performance that is neither a trumpet-call nor a 
steam-whistle, but an indescribable noise, that begins in 
agony, and abruptly breaks down in despair. It is diffi- 
cult to get the train in motion. The lady who ordered 
Succarina has got a strange donkey, and Macaroni has 
on the wrong saddle. Succarina is a f.ivorite, the kind- 
est, easiest, and surest-footed of beasts, — a diminutive 
animal, not bigger than a Friesland sheep ; old, in fact 
grizzly with years, and not unlike the aged, wizened 
little women who are so common here : for beauty in 
this region dries up ; and these handsome Sorrento girls, 
if they live, and almost everybody does live, have the 
prospect, in their old ae, of becoming mummies, with 
parchment skins. I have heard of climates that preserve 
female beauty ; this embalms it, only the beauty escapes 
in the process. As I was saying, Succarina is little, old,
