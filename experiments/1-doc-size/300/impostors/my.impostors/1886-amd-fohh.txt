"Basil is not an ardent lover, in my estimation," the 
sister returns, dryly ; and with a sudden touch of earnest- 
ness, ' ' he could love so deeply, so tenderly ! You should 
have seen him at times with Lloyd. O Doris ! it does 
seem as if things in this world were curiously and per- 
versely wrong." 

Some one comes up the path. From the wide porch 
to the street there is one space of exquisite velvet turf, 
without tree or shrub to break the emerald slope. Then 
there is a winding carriageydrive, a narrower walk, and 
trees so admirably grouped and placed that the lawn 
seems much larger than it really is, and the outlook is 
clear. 

"Oh!" Olive says, "it is Reese Trevenna and Miss 
Van Antwerp." 



 



 



 

For the first time since his actual settlement in busi- 
ness, Trevenna has given himself a real vacation, and 
none too soon, if one judged by the worn, pallid face 
which savors of much work by night as well as by day. 
Oddly enough, he has chosen to haunt the Elms. He has 
spent two evenings, two or three mornings, and this seems 
to be a favorite time with him. Except at the mornings, 
he has brought his mother or his aunt, and he always 
inquires for Miss Wentworth. 

" Don't go in," Miss Van Antwerp says, in her pretty^ 
quaint manner. "It is so pleasant out-of-doors." 

" It seems the most natural to me to live out-of-doors 
in summer," Doris explains ; and she brings the comfort- 
able willow chair out on the terrace. Back of them is 
a great clump of Norway pine in its dark green that is 
almost sombre. Olive is in white, with a cluster of roses 
at her belt and throat. Doris has, instead of the roses^ 
her usual black ribbons. 

Trevenna goes to the hammock and lifts out Lloyd, and 
sitting on the lowest step, places him on his knee and 
begins a most fascinating process of entertainment, his 
applause being a series of the gayest baby laughs. 

Doris studies him with a new interest. He is of aver- 
age height, has a well-proportioned figure, but it could not 
well be thinner if he had been in athletic training. The 
face has an unbusiness look. There are ideal breadths 
and spaces that make Doris think of some of the younger 
artists and musicians who have died in early manhood. 
The eyes are large, gray, and with a certain dreaminess 
as soon as they fall into repose, and the mouth shuts with 
a delicate sweetness. It is not a handsome face, but a 
suggestive one ; and it does interest her to-night, though 
she has simply thought of him before as a grave gentle- 
man somewhat tired out, pleasant, and not at all cynical. 
Indeed, it seems to be Olive who says all the bright, 
sharp things. 



 



 



FOES OP HER HOUSEHOLD. 

She hears the lazy roll of carriage wheels and glances 
up. It is the handsome Stirling turnout, with the glossy 
black horses that are always groomed to perfection, and 
the silver-mounted harness that is delicate rather than 
ornate. These are Mrs. Stirling's. She sits there hand- 
some, high-bred, and Louise by her side is a perfect foil 
in brilliancy, with wild-rose cheeks and sparkling eyes. 
They are driving very slowly. 

Louise nods in her quick, vivacious manner. Agatha's 
eyes seem to take them all in deliberately, not unkindly 
perhaps ; but it seems to Doris, in her intuitive way, which 
now has come to be a part of her nature, developed largely 
by much solitary thinking, that her eyes rest longest on 
Trevenna. Her child is on his knee. It brings a possi- 
bility vividly before the young mother, and colors her 
cheeks. 

Yet she cannot imagine Agatha being the wife of any 
moderately poor man. Not because she is beautiful, — 
Doris has seen handsome women sitting by waysides, nurs- 
ing babies, but they could not understand Latin poems and 
Greek choruses. 

" How magnificent Agatha is ! " Trevenna says pres- 
ently. " And Louise is going to have her full share of the 
Wentworth beauty." 

" Mine too," appends Olive, dryly. 

" I don't know as to that," Trevenna answers, with a 
sweet good-nature. "You have improved wonderfully, 
Olive." 

'' Thank you." And she nods her head almost gayly. 

" What a marrying time there will be ! " he continues. 
" You and I and Graham will be the only ones left out of 
the circle. For it always seemed a home circle to me," he 
adds, reflectively. 

It is a curious reflection to Doris at this moment that 
Olive and Trevenna should be the first ones to come back 
to the old house, her first-fruits in the hard battle of Hfe. 



 



 



 

If they — but Olive will never soften enough to win a man 
of Trevenna's stamp. 

" Do you know," he begins when no one fills the pause, 
'' I am a little disappointed about Basil's engagement? I 
expected him to marry some special woman who would be 
designed for him in a particular way, or else indulge in a 
Lord Burleigh fancy." 

" He is not that kind," returns Olive, sharply. Doris 
colors delicately. It was Lloyd who played Lord Bur- 
leigh. 

Marie comes for the baby. They go on talking in a 
desultory manner, until the carriages have thinned out 
and the air begins to cool. Miss Van Antwerp draws her 
dainty lavender-tinted shawl about her shoulders, and 
mildly suggests a return. 

" I must have my music first," he says, rising, and they 
all go in. The spacious room is shadowy, but not dark. 
Just across the organ pipes there is a reflection of the last 
line of red gold in the evening sky. 

They turn the leaves of the old mass and pause at Et 
Resurrexit. Olive plays with strong feeling, not merely 
womanly fancy. Doris listens in a mood compounded of 
many emotions, and dreams of the time when the Elms 
was a charmed rendezvous for the intellectual and musi- 
cal element in Westwater. She has strung together the 
fragmentary reminiscences of Lloyd into a chain of lovely 
days and bright, attractive evenings. She can almost see 
them in their fascinating play of meanings and theories, 
and aesthetics and laws of beauty. Has it helped with 
their own lives ? Do they all turn and go after the gods of 
this world, — money, station, and the objective good ? Doris 
is more than ever puzzled with the mystery. Everything 
is so different from what she imagined, looking through 
Lloyd's eyes. Is it possible he did not catch the right 
meaning? For it seems to her the culture, the gathering 
of what was best in other ages of story, song, and phi- 



 



 



 

losophy, the grand theories and heroic virtues, ought to 
regenerate themselves first of all. 

What fruit have they borne? Has Agatha been free 
from mercenary aims ? If it was a sin for Aunt Gilbert 
to plan for her marrying well, what is it in the other case ? 
And it appears as if Basil must have been governed by 
ambition. Doris has not been attracted by Miss Minturn, 
who seems a rather haughty, showy girl. Lloyd's months 
of pleasant idyllic love appear more to her like true 
living. 

The last low wandering sound dies out, and the guests 
say a pleasant good evening. Left alone, the girls take up 
the interrupted subject. 

"Yes," Doris begins, with a confidence that has more of 
the strength of maturity than the hopefulness of sweet, 
blind youth, "you will come back here. I am so alone, 
and I want to do some of the work Lloyd planned. I 
want to open the house and make it attractive, and gather 
pleasant people in it. Why can we not ?" And she studies 
the dark face wistfully. 

" You will not like society, Doris. It is hollow, deceit- 
ful, a sham of shams," the elder girl says sharply. 

" There must be some honest and true enjoyment, em- 
ployment as well. Think, Olive, I am not yet twenty ; 
what shall I do with the next twenty years of my life ? 
They should be rich and full and broad, so that I can 
garner a harvest for the older years." And the fair young 
face is illumined by an earnest soul purpose. 

" Yet why spend your time and your efforts for nought ? " 
Olive says, moodily. " Why offer feasts to people who 
come and partake, and then criticise you to the next per- 
son they meet? I hate society." 

Doris is silent. She loves Olive with a tender regard, 
as one might cherish some poor wounded thing laid at 
one's feet to be nursed back to life, but she recognizes the 
limitations that seem like walls of adamant. For Olive 



 



 



 

is absorbing and curiously jealous, and Doris sometimes 
feels as if she was a prisoner still, with only a change of 
jailers. 

" There is the going away,'' Olive remarks, rousing 
herself. "I should like that better. There is so much 
more in the great world than in an exclusive, aristocratic 
place like Westwater." 

She consults Judge Minturn in the course of the next 
few days on the feasibility of this project. 

" Why do you want to go abroad? " he inquires, with a 
touch of bruskness, — " and with Olive Wentworth? The 
baby is too young for changes, and you are too young for 
such a wandering life, unless you had a husband to protect 
you. If you must journey about, visit your own land a 
little. There are bright cities and beautiful out-of-the-way 
places, solitary as the Alps. And why not open the Elms 
to the world again? Come, there is enough to do without 
getting moped and dismal." 

She smiles. Something in his voice has inspirited her 
like a breezy west wind after sultry weather. 

" That is what I should like," she answers. 

"Well," he replies, " after this marrying business is 
over, I must look after you. Be patient a little." 

Doris answers him with a delicious expression of faith 
in his ability. 

He has seen a possibility for Basil Wentworth that it 
would have been impolitic to point out, and he is proud 
to have him for a son-in-law. Only this staid, formal 
courtship does not seem fitted for youth, for the founda- 
tion of a happy life, and he is bewildered by it. More 
than all, saddest of all, Basil seems dropping down from 
his high estate. Is the pursuit of money pure and sim- 
ple demoralizing to men's souls? Not that Wentworth 
will ever go astray on any point of honor, so called, or 
dim his integrity ; but now, at the farther end of the 
journey, the judge realizes that there are many other
