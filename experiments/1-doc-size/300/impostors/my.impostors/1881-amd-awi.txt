that she has a reason for standing apart and cold, with 
firm lips and steady eyes that would seem to a careless 
observer as if the breach between them was wide and 
deep for all time, too wide for even friendship to cross? 

But once out of the electric atmosphere, a quick resolve 
came to St. George. That this third person was Dolly, 
he felt certain. It could make no difference now, it could 
not alter one plan, yet his blood rushed to fever heat to 
exonerate Christmas Ormiston from the least shadow of 
blame. At last she stood forth purely noble and generous 
in his mind ; a late revelation, yethe hugged the knowledge 
to his soul as some treasure that not even death could 
take from him. 

It is late when he reaches the city, too late for an inter- 
view with Jeffries. He goes at once to the hotel, where 
he finds Mrs. Stannard strangely restless, pacing the fioor 
in a soft, trailing black gown, that gives her a startlingly 
beautiful appearance. 

Dolly is on the sofa. She holds out the whitest hand, 



 



 




it might be wax, it has not the rigidity of marble. He 
looks to find her petulant and impatient, but she is 
neither. 

" I thooght yon were never coming," she says with a 
kind of regretful softness. " Helen would not order the 
dinner. She has been fretting and fuming." 

" Anxious," corrects Mrs. Stannard shortly. " I could 
not think what had kept you away, and one has a hun- 
dred fears at such a time. Dolly never did take any care 
on her shoulders," complainingly. 

" And why should I now? You two oould care for a 
raiment." 

'' Thank you ; I find my hands full enough with one," 
the elder sister says, pointedly. 

" Order the dinner. Some peaches and grapes for 
me." 

The waiter brings it in and arranges the table. St. 
Gkorge sits by Dolly, holding her hand, with none of the 
repulsion he had expected would sway him. She has a 
strange, light, unearthly beauty that seems melting away 
at every moment. Her eyes are soft, lustrous, dreamy ; 
her pretty mouth is like a child's, softened with something 
not quite a smile that comes and goes like a wavering 
touch of illumination. 

" Come," he says, when the table is in order. 

" I am so comfortable, I do not want to be disturbed. 
Bring my grapes here " ; and she motions to the table that 
holds her bouquet sent in this morning. " Now take your 
dinner and soften into good-nature, both of you, so you 
can entertain me afterward. Where have you been? Tell 
Helen your day's adventure and I shall listen." 

" It was some perplexing business that will not interest 
you," he returns gravely. 

"You do not know. I am going to give up frivolity, 
and take to serious pursuits. You will be amazed at the 
kind of woman I shall make." 



 



 



 

Helen Stannard frowns a little. 

" It wag out of the city," says Dolly. "Ton spoke of 
the train." 

" Really, I shall have to be carefol if you are going to 
be so penetrating. You will discover all my secrets." 

" I 'm not curious about secrets," DoUy returns, lan- 
guidly. "We will lock up the past on Saturday, and 
brgin anew." 

The two at the table chat in a desultory fashion, with an 
occasional comment from Dolly. Then the fragments are 
sent away, except the fruit, and St. Greorge returns to the 
sofa. 

" You have not touched your grapes," he says in sur- 
prise. You eat nothing." 

" Then I must be in love," she replies, in a quaint irre- 
sistible tone. 

He stoops and kisses her. Her forehead is cool and 
purely white, with stray curling ends of golden-brown hair, 
and her drooping eyelids are blue with veins crossing and 
recrossing. 

" Now go and play for me," she requests. " The So- 
nata Pathetique. Christmas played it one evening in the 
twilight. I don't know why, but your playing makes mo 
think of her." 

The windows are closed, and up at this height there is 
no roar from the busy street below. Helen has lowered 
the lights, and St. Greorge, seating himself, plays with inef- 
fable tenderness. What is sTie doing at Glen Ormiston in 
that great, lonely house? What will she do with all the 
years to come? 

Beethoven is St. George's favorite master. This dreamy 
playing takes him back to nights with his father. What 
strange mood has come over Dolly, or is there some latent 
capability in every woman's soul? Has he fought out his 
battle and come off victor? for he looks at the future with 
nnshrinking eyes, and softens marvellously toward the 



 



 





woman who is to be his wife a few days hence. Fanlty 
she certainly is, but does he care to plunge into the past 
that she has hidden away? Will he wring anything out 
of Jeffries to-morrow morning ; any secret that he would 
not like confronting him when she sat at his table and 
shared his daily life ? 

" Dolly must be asleep,' Helen says in one of the 
pauses. " Dolly ! " raising her yoice a trifle. 

There is no answer. 

" Don't play any more,' Mrs. Stannard exclaims. There 
is a curious jealousy at fever heat in her veins. So soon 
he will belong to another. All these years he has been 
free, and the want has been slowly crystallizing, the hope- 
less, passionless longing for something she had blindly 
put away, and now, when she knows what it is, and is 
free, when a few more months would give her the right to 
incline this soul gently towards herself, he will be beyond 
that boundary, his life wasted upon futQe and frivolous 
endeavors. 

He looks at his watch presently. << It is late," he ex- 
claims in surprise. ''Is Dolly sleeping all this while?" 
Then he crosses the room to her sofa. She has turned 
her face over on the pillow, and dropped it down a little. 
The long lashes sweep the cheek which has the smooth 
frost look of marble, and the color has all gone out of the 
lovely, slightly parted lips. He takes the hand with a 
great shock of fear, and it is cold, pulseless ; the face is 
cold; the heart has stopped beating, worn to its last 
thread. Dolly Allaire has gone to some other country, 
some other, infinite Judgment, and he resolves not to know, 
not to Judge anything that she has withheld from his 
keeping. 

Helen utters a wild shriek and faints quite away. Fanny 
is summoned and oHxeT assistance, but Dolly rests in sweet 
unconsciousness with a child's expression on her face that 
is sweeter than in life. He could look at her forever.



 



 



 

She has never been in hiB life in any vital sense of possea* 
sion, and there is no awful consciousness of personal loss ; 
but if he could he would bring her back to the life she loved 
so well, even if he gave her his life also. 

Christmas is shocked by the summons, yet not greatly 
surprised, knowing what she did. Dolly is to be taken to 
Meadowcrof t, and though there is a large concourse of 
people to do her honor, there are but three of the nearest. 
Helen seems turned into stone ; there is an uneasy sense 
in her soul, like an unquiet ghost, but Christmas has no 
such follower. She is doubly thankful that she could do 
anything to bless Dolly's last days, even at a great sacri- 
fice. St. Greorge is the brother friend he has always been, 
doubly a brother now. 

There is a shivering, ghostly gloom at Meadowcroft. 
The old brightness has vanished everywhere, even the 
cosy home look Christmas has been wont to dream over. 
The new Mrs. Allaire has impressed it with the conven- 
tional aspect of money, and on an occasion like this its 
loneliness is intolerable. Even Helen will not remain all 
night. After they have laid DoUy Allaire beside her 
father, they take the train to the city. It is all so strange 
and unreal to Christmas. 

She does not inquire about Jeffries, every thought con- 
cerning him is repugnant. In some occult, sympathetic 
way she feels that St. George will see the matter in her 
light. Better a hundred times that the money should go. 
Ormiston Mills can stand that in the tide of its prosperity. 

Leighton St. Greorge makes his own terms with Jeffries 
Carew, one item of which is that they will withdraw the 
prosecution if he leaves the country immediately. 

''You once had a letter of Miss Ormiston's that she 
wrote when at school," Mr. St. George says. <' If it is 
still in existence, you can transfer it to me.'' 

'' Why should I save a scrawl like that I'' and for once 
he tells the truth, though he flings it out sullenly. He can 



 



 





make no capital with falsehoods here, hold nothing in 
terror over Miss Ormiston's head. No doubt they have 
compared notes all through. He writhes a little under 
these clear, penetrating eyes, and feels that he shall be 
better satisfied to escape them for the future. The ocean 
is none too broad to flow between. 

"You may like to know that Dolly Allaire never was 
my wife," he says, touched by some latent feeling he 
cannot quite comprehend himself. "The ceremony was 
a mere sham. We thought we loved each other then." 

St. George waves his hand decisively, commandingly. 
He will listen to nothing against the dead, but he knows 
now this was Miss Ormiston's secret. 

"Then you have not that letter?" he asks sharply, 
recurring to his own question. 

" I have no letter of Miss Ormiston's, or Miss Allaire's. 
I can begin with a clean record," he says insolently. St 
George feels inclined to knock him down. It would be a 
great gratification to send him to a felon's cell, bat he 
refrains, since it is Miss Ormiston's wish.
