parapet The men so stationed had discharged their pieces 
during the assault, and were busily employed in reloading 
when they noticed the Zouave perched upon the top of the 
vail. One or two who had pistols fired them at him, but

without effect. One or two threw stones from the interior 
of the vineyard. 

Gouache threw himself on his face along the wall and 
began quickly to throw down the topmost stones. The mortar 
was scarcely more solid than dry mud, and in a few seconds 
he had made a perceptible impression upon the masonry. But 
the riflemen had meanwhile finished reloading and one of 
them, taking careful aim, fired upon the Zouave. The bullet 
hit him in the fleshy part of the shoulder, causing a stinging 
pain and, what was worse, a shock that nearly sent him roll 
ing over the edge. Still he clung on desperately, loosening the 
stones with a strength one would not have expected in his 
spare frame. A minute longer, during which half a dozen 
more balls whizzed over him or flattened themselves against 
the stones, and then his comrades made another rush, con 
centrating their force this time at the spot where he had 
succeeded in lowering the barrier. His left arm was almost 
powerless from the flesh-wound in his shoulder, but with his 
right he helped the first man to a footing beside him. In a 
moment more the Zouaves were swarming over the wall and 
dropping down by scores into the shallow pool on the other 
side. 

The fight was short but desperate. The enemy, driven 
to bay in the corners of the yard and within the farmhouse, 
defended themselves manfully, many of them being killed 
and many more wounded. But the place was carried and 
the great majority fled precipitately through the exits at 
the back and made the best of their way towards Mentana. 

An hour later Gouache was still on his legs, but exhausted 
by his efforts in scaling the wall and by loss of blood from 
his wound, he felt that he could not hold out much longer. 
The position at that time was precarious. It was nearly 
four o'clock and the days were short. The artillery was 
playing against the little town, bat the guns were light field- 
pieces of small calibre, and though their position was 
frequently changed they made but little impression upon the 
earthworks thrown up by the enemy. The Garibaldians 
massed themselves in large numbers as they retreated from 
various points upon Mentana, and though their weapons

were inferior to those of their opponents their numbers 
made them still formidable. The Zouaves, gendarmes, and 
legionaries, however, pressed steadily though slowly onward. 
The only question was whether the daylight would last long 
enough. Should the enemy have the advantage of the long 
night in which to bring up reinforcements from Monte 
Eotondo and repair the breaches in their defences the attack 
might last through all the next day. 

The fortunes of the little battle were decided by the French 
chasseurs, who had gradually worked out a flanking move 
ment under cover of the trees and the broken country. Just 
as Gouache felt that he could stand no longer, a loud shout 
upon the right announced the charge of the allies, and a few 
minutes later the day was practically won. The Zouaves 
rushed forward, cheered and encouraged by the prospect of 
immediate success, but Anastase staggered from the ranks 
and sank down under a tree unable to go any farther. He 
had scarcely settled himself in a comfortable position when 
he lost consciousness and fainted away. 

Mentana was not taken, but it surrendered on the follow 
ing morning, and as Monte Eotondo had been evacuated 
during the night and most of the Garibaldians had escaped 
over the frontier, the fighting was at an end, and the cam 
paign of twenty-four hours terminated in a complete victory 
for the Eoman forces. 

When Gouache came to himself his first sensation was 
that of a fiery stream of liquid gurgling in his mouth and 
running down his throat. He swallowed the liquor half 
unconsciously, and opening his eyes for a moment was aware 
that two men were standing beside him, one of them holding 
a lantern in his hand, the rays from which dazzled the wounded 
Zouave and prevented him from recognising the persons. 

' Where is he hurt ? ' asked a voice that sounded strangely 
familiar in his ears. 

' I cannot tell yet,' replied the other man, kneeling down 
again beside him and examining him attentively. 

' It is only my shoulder,' gasped Gouache. ' But I am 
very weak. Let me sleep, please.' Thereupon he fainted 
again, and was conscious of nothing more for some time. 




The two men took him up and carried him to a place 
near, where others were waiting for him. The night was 
intensely dark, and no one spoke a word, as the little party 
picked its way over the battle-field, occasionally stopping to 
avoid treading upon one of the numerous prostrate bodies 
that lay upon the ground. The man who had examined 
Gouache generally stooped down and turned the light of his 
lantern upon the faces of the dead men, expecting that some 
one of them might show signs of life. But it was very late, 
and the wounded had already been carried away. Gouache 
alone seemed to have escaped observation, an accident prob 
ably due to the fact that he had been able to drag himself 
to a sheltered spot before losing his senses.' 

During nearly an hour the men trudged along the road 
with their burden, when at last they saw in the distance the 
bright lamps of a carriage shining through the darkness. 
The injured soldier was carefully placed among the cushions, 
and the two gentlemen who had found him got in and closed 
the door. 

Gouache awoke in consequence of the pain caused by the 
jolting of the vehicle. The lantern was placed upon one of 
the vacant seats and illuminated the faces of his companions, 
one of whom sat behind him and supported his weight by 
holding one arm around his body. Anastase stared at this 
man's face for some time in silence and in evident surprise. 
He thought he was in a dream, and he spoke rather to 
assure himself that he was awake than for any other reason. 

' You were anxious lest I should escape you after all,' he 
said. ' You need not be afraid. I shall be able to keep my 
engagement.' 

' I trust you will do nothing of the kind, iny dear 
Gouache,' answered Giovanni Saracinesca. 



CHAPTER XIV 

ON the Saturday afternoon preceding the battle of Montana, 
Sant' Ilario was alone in his own room, trying to pass the 
weary hours in the calculation of certain improvements he 





 

meditated at Saracinesca. He had grown very thin and 
careworn during the week, and he found it hard to distract 
his mind even for a moment from the thought of his mis 
fortunes. Nothing but a strong mental effort in another 
direction could any longer fix his attention, and though any 
kind of work was for the present distasteful to him, it was 
at least a temporary relief from the contemplation of his mis 
fortunes. 

He could not bring himself to see Corona, though she grew 
daily worse, and both the physicians and the attendants who 
were about her looked grave. His action in this respect did 
not proceed from heartlessness, still less from any wish to 
add to her sufferings ; on the contrary, he knew very well 
that, since he could not speak to her with words of forgive 
ness, the sight of him would very likely aggravate her state. 
He had no reason to forgive her, for nothing had happened 
to make her guilt seem more pardonable than before. Had 
she been well and strong as usual he would have seen her 
often and would very likely have reproached her again and 
again most bitterly with what she had done. But she was 
ill and wholly unable to defend herself ; to inflict fresh pain 
at such a time would have been mean and cowardly. He 
kept away and did his best not to go mad, though he felt 
that he could not bear the strain much longer. 

As the afternoon light faded from his chamber he 
dropped the pencil and paper with which he had been work 
ing and leaned back in his chair. His face was haggard and 
drawn, and sleepless nights had made dark circles about his 
deep-set eyes, while his face, which was naturally lean, had 
grown suddenly thin and hollow. He was indeed one of 
the most unhappy men in Rome that day, and so far as he 
could see his misery had fallen upon him through no fault of 
his own. It would have been a blessed relief, could he have 
accused himself of injustice, or of any misdeed which might 
throw the weight and responsibility of Corona's actions back 
upon his own soul. He loved her still so well that he could 
have imagined nothing sweeter than to throw himself at her 
feet and cry aloud that it was he who had sinned and not 
she. He tortured his imagination for a means of proving 




that she might be innocent. But it was in vain. The chain 
of circumstantial evidence was complete and not a link was 
missing, not one point uncertain. He would have given her 
the advantage of any doubt which could be thought to exist, 
but the longer he thought of it all, the more sure he grew 
that there was no doubt whatever. 

He sat quite still until it was nearly dark, and then with 
a sudden and angry movement quite unlike him, he sprang 
to his feet and left the room. Solitude was growing unbear 
able to him, and though he cared little to see any of his 
associates, the mere presence of other living beings would, he 
thought, be better than nothing. He was about to go out of 
the house when he met the doctor coming from Corona's 
apartments. 

' I do not wish to cause you unnecessary pain,' said the 
physician, ' but I think it would be better that you should 
see the princess.' 

' Has she asked for me ? ' inquired Giovanni, gloomily. 

' No. But I think you ought to see her.'

' Is she dying ? ' Sant' Ilario spoke under his breath and 
laid his hand on the doctor's arm. 

' Pray be calm, Signer Principe. I did not say that 
But I repeat ' 

' Be good enough to say what you mean without repeti 
tion,' answered Giovanni almost savagely. 

The physician's face flushed with annoyance, but as 
Giovanni was such a very high and mighty personage he 
controlled his anger and replied as calmly as he could. 

' The princess is not dying. But she is very ill. She 
may be worse before morning. You had better see her now, 
for she will know you. Later she may not.' 

Without waiting for more Giovanni turned on his heel 
and strode towards his wife's room. Passing through an 
outer chamber he saw one of her women sitting in a corner 
and shedding copious tears. She looked up and pointed to 
the door in a helpless fashion. In another moment Giovanni 
was at Corona's bedside. 

He would not have recognised her. Her face was wasted 
and white, and looked ghastly by contrast with the masses of 







her black hair which were spread over the broad pillow. 
Her colourless lips were parted and a little drawn, and hei 
breath came faintly. Only her eyes retained the expression 
of life, seeming larger and more brilliant than he had ever 
seen them before. 

Giovanni gazed on her in horror for several seconds. In 
his imagination he had supposed that she would look as when 
he had seen her last, and the shock of seeing her as she was, 
unstrung his nerves. For an instant he forgot everything 
that was past in the one strong passion that dominated him 
in spite of himself. His arms went round her and amidst 
his blinding tears he showered hot kisses on her death-like 
face. With a supreme effort, for she was so weak as to be 
almost powerless, she clasped her hands about his neck and 
pressed her to him, or he pressed her. The embrace lasted 
but a moment and her arms fell again like lead. 

' You know the truth at last, Giovanni,' she said, feebly. 
' You know that I am innocent or you would not ' 

He did not know whether her voice failed her from weak 
ness, or whether she was hesitating. He felt as though she 
had driven a sharp weapon into his breast by recalling all 
that separated them. He drew back a little, and his face 
darkened 

What could he do ? She was dying and it would be 
diabolically cruel to undeceive her. In that moment he 
would have given his soul to be able to lie, to put on again 
the expression that was in his face when he had kissed her a 
moment before. But the suffering of which she reminded 
him was too great, the sin too enormous, and though he tried 
bravely he could not succeed. But he made the effort. He 
tried to smile, and the attempt was horrible. He spoke, but 
there was no life in his words.
