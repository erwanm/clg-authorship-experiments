water that comes down around it forms an eddy and 
allows the sed’ment to sink. Do you see those fine 
lines on the face of the water that branch out like the 
ribs of a fan? Well, those are little reefs; you want to 
just miss the ends of them, but run them pretty close. 
Now look out — look out! Don’t you crowd that 
slick, greasy-looking place; there ain’t nine feet there; 
she won’t stand it. She begins to smell it; look sharp* 
I tell you ! Oh, blazes, there you go ! Stop the star- 
board wheel ! Quick ! Ship up to back ! Set her 
back ! ” 

The engine bells jingled and the engines answered 
promptly, shooting white columns of steam far aloft 
out of the ’scape-pipes, but it was too late. The boat 
had “ smelt ” the bar in good earnest; the foamy ridges 
that radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared, a 
great dead swell came rolling forward, and swept ahead 
of her, she careened far over to larboard, and went 
tearing away toward the shore as if she were about 
scared to death. We were a good mile from where we 
ought to have been when we finally got the upper hand 
of her again. 

During the afternoon watch the next day, Mr. Bixby 
asked me if I knew how to run the next few miles. I 
said : 

“ Go inside the first snag above the point; outside 
the next one, start out from the lower end of Higgins’s 
woodyard, make a square crossing, and — ” 

“ That’s all right. I’ll be back before you close up 
on the next point.” 

But he wasn’t. He was still below when I rounded 
it and entered upon a piece of the river which I had 
some misgivings about. I did not know that he was 
hiding behind a chimney to see how I would perform. 
I went gayly along, getting prouder and prouder, for 
he had never left the boat in my sole charge such a 
length of time before. I even got to “ setting ” her and 
letting the wheel go entirely, while I vaingloriously 
turned my back and inspected the stem marks and 
hummed a tune, a sort of easy indifference which I had 
prodigiously admired in Bixby and other great pilots. 
Once I inspected rather long, and when I faced to the 
front again my heart flew into my mouth so suddenfy 
that if I hadn’t clapped my teeth together I should 
have lost it. One of those frightful bluff reefs was 
stretching its deadly length right across our bows ! My 
head was gone in a moment ; I did not know which 
end I stood on ; I gasped and could not get my breath ; 
I spun the wheel down with such rapidity that it wove 
itself together like a spider’s web; the boat answered 
and turned square away from the reef, but the reef fol- 
lowed her ! I fled, but still it followed, still it kept — 
right across my bows ! I never looked to see where I 
was going, I only fled. The awful crash was imminent. 
Why didn’t that villain come? If I commuted the 
crime of ringing a bell I might get thrown overboard. 
But better that than kill the boat. So in blind despera- 
tion, I started such a rattling << shivaree ,, down below 
as never had astounded an engineer in this world before,. 
I fancy. Amidst the frenzy of the bells the engines 
began to back and fill in a curious way, and my reason 
forsook its throne — we were about to crash into the 
woods on the other side of the river. Just then Mr. 
Bixby stepped calmly into view on the hurricane deck. 
My soul went out to him in gratitude. My distress 
vanished ; I would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara 
with Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck. He blandly 
and sweetly took his toothpick out of his mouth be- 
tween his fingers, as if it were a cigar, — we were just 
in the act of climbing an overhanging big tree, and the 
passengers were scudding astern like rats, — and lifted 
up these commands to me ever so gently : 

'' Stop the starboard ! Stop the larboard! Set her 
back on both ! ” 

The boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among 
the boughs a critical instant, then reluctantly began to 
back away t 

“ Stop the larboard ! Come ahead on it ! Stop the 
starboard ! Come ahead on it ! Point her for the 
bar!” 

I sailed away as serenely as a summer’s morning. 
Mr. Bixby came in and said, with mock simplicity: 

“ When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap 
the big bell three times before you land, so that the 
engineers can get ready.” 

I blushed under the sarcasm, and said I hadn’t had 
any hail, 

“Ah! Then it was for wood, I suppose. The 
officer of the watch will tell you when he wants to 
wood up.” 

I went on consuming, and said I wasn’t after wood' 



“ Indeed? Why, what could you want over here in 
the bend, then? Did you ever know of a boat follow- 
ing a bend up-stream at this stage of the river? ” 

“ No, sir — and I wasn’t trying to follow it. I was 
getting away from a bluff reef.” 

“No, it wasn’t a bluff reef; there isn’t one within 
three miles of where you were.” 

“ But I saw it. It was as bluff as that one yonder.” 
“Just about. Run over it! ” 

“ Do you give it as an order? ” 

“ Yes. Run over it ! ” 

“ If I don’t, I wish I may die.” 

“All right; I am taking the responsibility.” 

I was just as anxious to kill the boat, now, as I had 
been to save it before. I impressed my orders upon 
my memory, to be used at the inquest, and made a 
straight break for the reef. As it disappeared under 
our bows I held my breath ; but we slid over it like oil. 

“ Now, don’t you see the difference? It wasn’t any- 
thing but a wind reef. The wind does that.” 

“ So I see. But it is exactly like a bluff reef. How 
am I ever going to tell them apart? ” 

“ I can’t tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you 
will just naturally know one from the other, but you 
never will be able to explain why or how you know 
them apart.” 

It turned out to be true. The face of the water, in 
time, became a wonderful book — a book that was a 
dead language to the uneducated passenger, but which 
told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its most 
cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with 
a voice. And it was not a book to be read once and 
thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every day. 
Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was 
never a page that was void of interest, never one that 
you could leave unread without loss, never one that you 
would want to skip, thinking you could find higher en- 
joyment in some other thing. There never was so 
wonderful a book written by man; never one whose 
interest was so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparklingly 
renewed with every re-perusal. The passenger who 
could not read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of 
faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions when 
he did not overlook it altogether) ; but to the pilot that 
was an italicized passage; indeed, it was more than 
that, it was a legend of the largest capitals, with a string 
of shouting exclamation points at the end of it, for it 
meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that 
could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever 
floated. It is the faintest and simplest expression the 
water ever makes, and the most hideous to a pilot's eye. 
In truth, the passenger who could not read this book 
saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it, 
painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas 
to the trained eye these were not pictures at all, but the 
grimmest and most dead-earnest of reading matter. 

Now when I had mastered the language of this water, 
and had come to know every trifling feature that bor- 
dered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters 
of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. 
But I had lost something, too. I had lost something 
which could never be restored to me while I lived. All 
the grace, the beauty, the poetry, had gone out of the 
majestic river ! I still kept in mind a certain wonderful 
sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new 
to me. A broad expanse of the river was turned to 
blood ; in the middle distance the red hue brightened 
into gold, through which a solitary log came floating, 
black and conspicuous ; in one place a long, slanting 
mark lay sparkling upon the water ; in another the surface 
was broken by boiling, tumbling rings, that were 
as many-tinted as an opal ; where the ruddy flush was 

faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with grace- 
ful circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately traced ; 
the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the 
somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in 
one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver; 
and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead 
tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed like a flame 
in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the 
sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images, 
woody heights, soft distances; and over the whole 
scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily, 
enriching it every passing moment with new marvels of 
coloring. 

I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a 
speechless rapture. The world was new to me, and I 
had never seen anything like this at home. But as I 
have said, a day came when I began to cease from 
noting the glories and the charms which the moon and 
the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river's face; 
another day came when I ceased altogether to note 
them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, 
I should have looked upon it without rapture, and 
should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this 
fashion: “ This sun means that we are going to have 
wind to-morrow ; that floating log means that the river 
is rising, small thanks to it; that slanting mark on the 
water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill some- 
body's steamboat one of these nights, if it keeps on 
stretching out like that; those tumbling ‘ boils ' show a 
dissolving bar and a changing channel there ; the lines 
and circles in the slick water over yonder are a warn- 
ing that that troublesome place is shoaling up danger- 
ously ; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is 
the ‘ break ’ from a new snag, and he has located himself
in the very best place he could have found to fish 
for steamboats ; that tall dead tree, with a single living 

branch, is not going to last long, and then how is a 
body ever going to get through this blind place at night 
without the friendly old landmark? ’’ 

No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from 
the river. All the value any feature of it had for me 
now was the amount of usefulness it could furnish 
toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat. 
Since those days, I have pitied doctors from my heart. 
What does the lovely flush in a beauty’s cheek mean 
to a doctor but a “break’’ that ripples above some 
deadly disease ? Are not all her visible charms sown 
thick with what are to him the signs and symbols of 
hidden decay? Does he ever see her beauty at all, or 
doesn’t he simply view her professionally, and comment 
upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And 
doesn’t he sometimes wonder whether he has gained- 
most or lost most by learning his trade ? 



CHAPTER X. 


COMPLETING MY EDUCATION 

W HOSOEVER has done me the courtesy to read 
my chapters which have preceded this may pos- 
sibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting as a 
science. It was the prime purpose of those chapters; 
and I am not quite done yet. I wish to show, in the 
most patient and painstaking way, what a wonderful 
science it is. Ship channels are buoyed and lighted, 
and therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to 
learn to run them ; clear water rivers, with gravel bot- 
toms, change their channels very gradually, and there- 
fore one needs to learn them but once ) but piloting be- 
comes another matter when you apply it to vast streams 
like the Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial 
banks cave and change constantly, whose snags are 
always hunting up new quarters, whose sandbars are 
never at rest, whose channels are forever dodging and 
shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in 
all nights and all weathers without the aid of a single 
lighthouse or a single buoy; for there is neither light 
nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this three or 
four thousand miles of villainous river.* I feel justified 
in enlarging upon this great science for the reason that 
I feel sure no one has ever yet written a paragraph 
about it who had piloted a steamboat himself, and so 
had a practical knowledge of the subject. If the theme 
was hackneyed, I should be obliged to deal gently with 
the reader ; but since it is wholly new, I have felt at 
liberty to take up a considerable degree of room with 
it. 
 
When I had learned the name and position of every 
visible feature of the river ; when I had so mastered its 
shape that I could shut my eyes and trace it from St. 
Louis to New Orleans ; when I had learned to read the 
face of the water as one would cull the news from the 
morning paper; and finally, when I had trained my 
dull memory to treasure up an endless array of sound- 
ings and crossing-marks, and keep fast hold of them, 
I judged that my education was complete ; so I got to 
tilting my cap to the side of my head, and wearing a 
toothpick in my mouth at the wheel. Mr. Bixby had 
his eye on these airs. One day he said:
